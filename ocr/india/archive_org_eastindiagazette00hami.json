On consideration of their tendency, it occurred to me, that a work containing in a small compass, and in the form best suited for reference, the information dispersed through many volumes, might at the present period prove of utility, and assist the judgments of many who had not before applied their attention to this subject.\n\nHaving finished an arrangement of this description, it could not with equal propriety be addressed to any other person than your Lordship, under whose auspices the commerce with India has been opened to the merchants of Britain, in a degree as great as appears consistent with the tranquillity of Hindostan, and with the existence of that Company by which those extensive regions were first acquired, and under whose administration they have attained so high a state of prosperity. I shall be happy if your Lordship will receive it as a proof of my respect for your public character, and for the abilities which led to so desirable a result.\n\nI have the honour to remain,\n\nMy Lord,\n\nYour Lordship's most obedient\nAnd most humble servant,\n\nWALTER HAMILTON.\nPREFACE.\n\nThe following work is intended to form a summary and popular account of India, and of its various inhabitants, adapted principally for the perusal of those who have never visited that quarter of the world, and whose leisure has not admitted of their examining the numerous volumes in which the local descriptions are dispersed. Until lately the unceasing changes among the native powers, the vicissitudes of their politics, and their perpetually fluctuating boundaries, rendered the most accurate account that could be given, only suited to the particular period in which it was written; but since the definitive arrangements of the Marquis Wellesley in 1803 and 5, Hindostan has experienced a tranquillity, and the relative boundaries of the different governments a degree of permanence, unknown since the death of Aurengzebe\nin 1707. The territorial divisions continue in many places perplexed and uncertain, and the jurisdictions of their chiefs ill defined; but these obstacles are not of such weight as to preclude an attempt to class the whole alphabetically.\n\nTo form a geographical basis, Mr. Arrowsmith's six sheet map of Hindostan, published in 1804, and his four sheet chart of the Eastern Seas, have been selected, as they exhibit the most correct delineation of this part of Asia hitherto presented to the public, and are in general use. Other maps and charts, subsequently engraved, have been occasionally consulted; but so seldom, that a very great majority of the latitudes and longitudes, distances and dimensions, refer to their positions in the two works above described. Within these limits are comprehended the following countries, viz.\n\nWEST OF THE INDUS.\n\nCabul, Candahar, Baloochistan, and all Afghanistan, &c.\n\nIN HINDOSTAN PROPER.\n\nLahore, Mooltan, Sinde, Tatta, Cutch, Ajmeer, and Gujrat; Delhi, Agra, and Malwah; Oude, Allahabad, Bahar, Bengal, &c.\nIN THE DECCAN.\n\nAurungabad, Bejapoor, Khandesh, Berar, Orissa, Gundwana, the Northern Circars, Cuttack, Nandere, Beeder, Hyderabad, &c.\n\nINDIA SOUTH OF THE KRISHNA RIVER.\n\nMysore, the Carnatic northern, central, and southern, Malabar, Canara, Coimbetoor, Travancor, Cochin, Dindigul, Barramahal, the Balaghaut ceded districts, Kistnagherry, &c.\n\nIN NORTHERN HINDOSTAN.\n\nCashmere, Serinagur, Nepaul, Bootan, and also the adjoining country of Tibet, &c.\n\nINDIA BEYOND THE GANGES.\n\nAva and the Birman Empire, Siam, Pegu, Aracan, Assam, Cassay, Tunquin, Cochin China, Cambodia, Laos, Siampa, Malacca, &c.\n\nTHE EASTERN ISLES.\n\nSumatra, Java, and all the Sunda chain, Borneo, Celebes, and Gilolo, the Moluccas, Papua, Magindanao, the Philippines, &c. and also the Island of Ceylon.\n\nIn arranging the alphabetical distribution, the great diversity of names applied to the same place by Hindoos, Mahommedans, and Europeans, occa-\nsioned a considerable difficulty, which has not been completely surmounted. To obviate it as much as possible, the whole of Mr. Arrowsmith's names have been adopted, as being those most universally known, and to enable the reader to find the place in the map without trouble. In many of the most remarkable instances the original appellation is also given, according to Sir William Jones's orthographical system; but, although a name be not quite correct, if generally understood, it is desirable it should continue permanent, as it answers every useful purpose, and a deviation even to a more appropriate causes much confusion. The deities of the Hindoos have a still greater variety of names, or rather epithets, than their towns; the most common have been selected, and adhered to throughout. The same plan has also been followed with regard to the names of persons, castes, and tribes.\n\nIn the composition of the work oriental terms have been usually avoided; but, from the nature of the subject, could not be wholly dispensed with. Of those of most frequent occurrence, an explanation will be found in the short Glossary annexed.\n\nThe plan usually followed is that of Brooke's, Crutwell's, and other Gazetteers, which, on account\nof the number of different articles, and the consequent abbreviation, does not admit of minute details, or the investigation of disputed facts. From this cause also the historical part has been contracted nearly to a chronological series of sovereigns and remarkable events. The authorities for each description are commonly subjoined, and in many cases this is given as closely as the necessity of condensing the substance of many volumes into a small compass would permit. But no person is to be considered wholly responsible for any article, the materials in many instances being so intimately blended with each other, and with the result of the author's own experience and inquiries, that it would be impossible to define the boundaries of the respective properties. A very considerable portion of the most valuable information contained in this publication will be found to be entirely new, being extracted from various unpublished manuscripts, collected by Sir John Malcolm, while he filled important official and diplomatic situations in Hindostan and Persia, and communicated by him in the most handsome and liberal manner. Of these and the other authorities referred to, a catalogue will be found in the Appendix.\nIn specifying the extent of countries the whole length, but only the average breadth is given, to enable the reader to ascertain the probable area in square miles. In an arrangement of this sort strict accuracy cannot be expected; but it was thought less vague than the usual mode of stating the extreme length and the extreme breadth, and an approximation to the reality is all that is required. The same observation applies to the population of countries that have not undergone local investigations. When such instances occur, a comparison of their peculiar circumstances has been instituted with those of the adjacent provinces, the population of which is better known, and an estimate computed from the result. Where the number of inhabitants has been established on probable grounds, it is particularly mentioned. To facilitate the discovery of a place on the map, besides its latitude and longitude, its nearest direct distance from some distinguished city is stated, and likewise the name of the province which includes it. When not otherwise specified, the standard of distance is invariably the English mile, $69\\frac{1}{2}$ to the degree.\n\nThe description of Hindostan, under the Em-\nperor Acber, compiled by Abul Fazel in 1582, is literally extracted from Mr. Gladwin's translation of the Ayeen Acberry, and is a curious remnant of Mogul geography. Although wrong in many instances, the dimensions are surprisingly exact, considering the era in which they were calculated; and the limits he assigns to the provinces must ever form the foundation of any delineation of Hindostan Proper, as they continued to regulate the jurisdictions of the viceroys for almost two centuries, and it would be in vain to follow the annually fluctuating principalities which sprung from the ruins of the Mogul empire. The distances mentioned by Abul Fazel are commonly the extreme length and extreme breadth; and the quotas of troops he enumerates mean the whole that the province was supposed capable of furnishing on any important exigence, not the actual number ever produced.\n\nOwing to the want of uniformity in the modes adopted by different authors of spelling the Indian names, the reader, it is apprehended, will at first experience some difficulty in discovering the place he is in search of, the whole of the vowels being substituted for each other, and also several of the\nconsonants, such as c for k and s, and g for j. When the word, therefore, does not occur under the head first suggested, it must be sought under one of a similar sound, such as for Tirhoot see Tyrhoot, and the geographical situations being very minutely detailed will greatly assist the research. The east and west, north and south, sides of rivers, and the compass distances, in a great majority of cases refer to their positions in the map; the length of rivers, including the windings, are estimated according to the rules laid down in Major Rennel's valuable Memoir, from which also the travelling distances are extracted.\n\nAnother objection to an alphabetical description of a country is, that the whole does not appear at one view, being dispersed and separated over different parts of the book, which is certainly against an arrangement in other respects remarkably convenient. To remedy this as far as is practicable, when a kingdom or province is described, all the most important towns and districts it contains are also specified, and by a reference to each of these a tolerable idea of the whole will be attained.\n\nIn describing the portions of territory into which\nmodern Hindostan is subdivided, the different possessors of the present day are generally particularized at considerable length; and where there is not any native proprietor named, it may be considered (with a very few exceptions) as comprehended in the British dominions. Many of the descriptions will be found extremely meagre, exhibiting little more than the geographical features of the article under discussion; but it will have the good effect of pointing out to the many eminent men, now residing in India, how little is known in Europe of countries with which they are intimately acquainted, and perhaps influence them to supply the deficiency. The facts here stated being collected within a narrow compass, they will be enabled with little trouble to correct on the spot what they perceive to be erroneous; and in a work of this nature numerous errors are unavoidable.\nACHEEN.\n\nARDON.\u2014One of the small Papuan islands, about three miles in circumference, situated to the north of the island of Wagecoo, and rising two hundred feet above the level of the sea.

E.\n\nACBERPOOR.\u2014A small town in the province of Agra, district of Etaweh, 25 miles W. from Canpoor. Lat. 26\u00b0. 23'. N., Long. 82\u00b0. 30'. E.\n\nACHEEN,\n\n(Achi).\u2014A kingdom in the north-western extremity of the island of Sumatra, bordering on the country of the Battas, but not extending inland above 50 miles to the S. E. On the western coast, where its influence was formerly predominant as far south as Indrapura, it now possesses no farther than Baroos, and even there, or at the intermediate ports, the power of the Acheenese sovereign is little more than nominal.\n\nThe air is comparatively healthy, the country being more free from woods and stagnant water than most other parts of Sumatra. The degree of insalubrity, however, attending situations in this climate, is known so frequently to alter from inscrutable causes, that a person who has resided only two or three years on a spot, cannot pretend to form a judgment.\n\nThe soil is light and fertile, and produces abundance of rice, excellent vegetables, much cotton, and the finest tropical fruits. Cattle, and other articles of provision, are plenty, and reasonable in price. In this province are found almost all the animals enumerated in the general description of Sumatra. The horses, although of an inferior breed, are exported; and there are domesticated elephants, on which the inhabitants travel, as well as on horseback.\n\nAlthough no longer the great mart of eastern commodities, Acheen still carries on a considerable trade, both with European merchants, and with the natives of the coast of that part of India called Telenga, but which\nis, by the Malays, named Kling, and applied to the whole coast of Coromandel. These supply it with salt, cotton piece goods, principally those called long cloths, white and blue, and chintz with dark grounds; receiving, in return, gold dust, raw silk of inferior quality, betel nut, patch leaf, pepper, sulphur, camphor, and benzoin. The two latter are carried thither from the river Sinkel, and the pepper from Pedecr; but this article is also exported from Soosoo to the amount of about 2000 tons annually. The quality is not esteemed good, being gathered before it is sufficiently ripe, and it is not cleaned like the Company's pepper. Prior to 1808 the Americans were the chief purchasers. The gold dust collected at Acheen comes partly from the mountains in the neighbourhood, but chiefly from Nalaboo and Soosoo.\n\nIn the Acheenese territories there is a considerable manufacture of a thick species of cotton cloth, and of striped and checkered stuff for short drawers, worn both by the Malays and Acheenese. They weave also very handsome and rich silk pieces of a particular form: but this fabric has decayed latterly, owing to a failure in the breed of silk worms, and probably also to a decay of industry among the inhabitants. They are expert and bold navigators, and employ a variety of vessels. The Acheenese have a small thin adulterated gold coin, rudely stamped with Arabic characters, called Mas; dollars and rupees also pass current, and other species of coin are taken at a valuation. Payments, however, are commonly made in gold dust, for which purpose every one is provided with small scales or steelyards.\n\nThe revenue of the crown arises from the export and import duties, and of course fluctuates considerably. European merchants pay betwixt five and six per cent. but the Coromandel traders are understood to be charged with much higher duties; in the whole not less than 15 per cent. of which 12 per cent. is taken out of the bales in the first instance. This disparity of duty they are enabled to support by the frugal manner in which they purchase their investments, and the cheap rate at which they navigate their vessels. These sources of revenue are independent of the profit derived from the trade, which is managed for his master by a person who is stiled the king's merchant.\n\nThe government is hereditary, and more or less arbitrary, in proportion to the talents of the reigning prince, who usually maintains a guard of 100 sepoys from the Coromandel coast. At the king's feet sits a woman, to whom he makes known his pleasure; by her it is communicated to an eunuch, who sits next to her, and by him to an officer named Kajuran Goodang, who proclaims it aloud to the assembly. Sultan Allah ud Deen, who reigned in 1784, when Capt. Forrest visited his court, had travelled, and had been a considerable time in the Mauritius, where he had been driven when proceeding on a pilgrimage to Mecca. Besides the Malay, he spoke French and Portuguese, and understood the casting of cannon and bomb shells. His vizier was a Turk from Constantinople. All matters relative to the customs and commerce of the port of Acheen are under the jurisdiction of the master attendant, or Shahbunder.\n\nThe country is populous, but the number of inhabitants has never been satisfactorily ascertained. The inhabitants differ considerably from the other Sumatrans, being in general taller and stouter, and of darker complexions. In their present state they cannot be considered as a genuine people, but are rather a mixture of Battas and Malays with Chalias, as they term the natives of the west of India, by whom their ports were frequented in all ages. In their dispositions they are more active and industrious than some of their neighbours; they possess more sagacity, have more knowledge of other countries, and as\nmerchants they deal on a more liberal and extensive footing. At the town of Acheen their conduct depends much on the example of the reigning monarch, which is often narrow, extortionary, and oppressive.\n\nThe language of Acheen consists of a mixture of Malay and Batta, with all the jargons used by the Mahomedans of the east, whether Hindostany, Arab-Tamil, or Moplay. The Acheenese resemble the Moplays of Malabar more than any tribe of Malays; as a people they have long been connected with them, and use many Moplay terms in their language, but they make use of the Malay character. In religion they are Mahomedans; and, having many priests, and much intercourse with strangers of the same faith, its forms and ceremonies are observed with considerable strictness.\n\nAcheen has ever been remarkable for the severity with which crimes are punished by law, but there is reason to believe the poor alone experience the rod of justice. The variety of their modes of punishment are too numerous and horrid to admit of their being detailed; but notwithstanding so much apparent discouragement, both from law and prejudice, all travellers agree in representing the Acheenee as one of the most dishonest and flagitious nations of the east, which the history of their government tends to corroborate.\n\nThe Acheenee territories were visited by the Portuguese as early as 1509, when Diego Lopez Siqueira cast anchor at Pedeer, a principal sea-port on this part of Sumatra. At this time Pasay, Pedeer, any other places were governed by petty princes, occasionally subordinate to the sultan of Acheen, and sometimes receiving tribute from him; but the state of Acheen soon afterwards gained an ascendancy, which it has ever since retained.\n\nEven at this early stage of their acquaintance, hostilities between the two nations commenced, and continued with very little cessation until the Portuguese lost Malacca in 1641. In the course of these wars it is difficult to determine which of the two is the more astonishing; the vigorous stand made by such a handful of men as the whole Portuguese force at Malacca consisted of, or the prodigious resources and perseverance of the Acheenee monarchs.\n\nAbout the year 1586 the consequence of the kingdom of Acheen had attained its greatest height. Its friendship was courted by the most considerable eastern potentates, and no city in India possessed a more flourishing trade. The customs of the port being moderate, it was crowded with merchants from all parts; and though the Portuguese and their ships were continually plundered, yet those belonging to every Asiatic power appear to have enjoyed perfect security in the business of their commerce. With respect to the government, the nobles, or Orang Cayos, formed a powerful counterpoise to the authority of the king. They were rich, had numerous followers, and cannon planted at the gates of their houses.\n\nTowards the close of the 16th century, the Hollanders began to navigate the Indian seas, and in the year 1600 some of their ships arrived at Acheen, when they were nearly cut off by treachery. The first English ships, under Capt. Lancaster, visited Acheen in 1602, and were received by the king with abundant respect and ceremony, which was usually proportioned by the Acheenee sovereigns to the number of vessels and apparent strength of their foreign guests.\n\nIn 1607, the reigning sultan, Peducka Siri, assumed the title of sovereign of Acheen, and of the countries of Aroo, Delhi, Johore, Paham, Queda, and Pera, on one side; and of Baroos, Passamau, Ticoa, Sileda, and Priaman, on the other. In his answer to a letter from King James the First, in 1613, he stiles himself King of all Sumatra, a name and idea, which, if they exist in the ori-\nginal, he must have learned from his European connexions. In that letter he expresses a strong desire that the King of England would send him out one of his countrywomen as a wife, and promised to make her eldest son king of all the pepper countries. The French first visited Acheen under Commodore Beaulieu, in 1621.\n\nIn the year 1640, the Dutch, with twelve men of war, and the Sultan of Acheen with twenty-five galleys, appeared before Malacca, which they had for so many years harrassed; and the following year it was wrested from the Portuguese, who had so long, and under such difficulties, kept possession of it. But as if the opposition of the Portuguese power, which first occasioned the rise of Acheen, was also necessary to its continuance; the splendour and consequence of the kingdom from that period rapidly declined, and in proportion its history became obscure. Through the subsequent weakness of the government, and the encroachments of the Dutch, the extent of its ancient dominion was much contracted.\n\nThe year 1641 was also marked by the death of Sultan Pedncka Siri, one of their most powerful and cruel sovereigns, who leaving no male heirs was peaceably succeeded by his queen, which forms a new era in the history of the state, as the succession continued until A.D. 1700, in the female line; the Acheenese being accustomed and reconciled to this species of government, which they found more lenient than that of their kings. The last queen died in 1700, when a priest found means, by his intrigues, to acquire the sovereignty. Since that period it has continued under a succession of sultans, and suffered many vicissitudes and sanguinary civil wars; but it has never ceased to exist as an independent principality, notwithstanding its internal convulsions. (Marsden, Leyden, Forrest, Elmore, &c.)\n\nAcheen.\u2014A town situated at the north-western extremity of the island of Sumatra, and the capital of a principality of the same name. Lat. 5\u00b0. 35'. N. Long. 95\u00b0. 45'. E.\n\nThis place stands about a league from the sea, on a river which empties itself by several channels, near the N.W. point of the island, named Acheen Head, where the shipping lies in a road rendered secure by the shelter of several islands. The depth of water on the bar being only four feet at low water spring tides, none but vessels of the country can venture to pass; it and, during the dry monsoon not even those of the larger class.\n\nThe city of Acheen is built in a plain in a wide valley, formed like an amphitheatre by lofty ranges of hills. It is described as extremely populous, containing 8000 houses, built of bamboos and rough timber, standing distinct from each other, and raised on piles some feet from the ground, to guard against the effect of inundation. The appearance of the place, and the nature of the buildings, differ but little from those of the generality of Malay bazars; excepting that its superior wealth has occasioned the erection of a greater number of public edifices, chiefly mosques, but without the smallest pretensions to magnificence. The country above the town is highly cultivated, and abounds with small villages.\n\nThe sultan's palace, if it deserves the name, is a very rude and uncouth piece of architecture, designed to resist the attack of internal enemies, and for that purpose surrounded with a moat and strong walls. Near the gate are several pieces of brass ordnance of an extraordinary size, of which some are Portuguese; but two, in particular, of English origin, attract attention. They were sent by King James the First to the reigning monarch of Acheen, and have still the founder's name and the date legible on them. The diameter of the bore of one is eighteen inches, of the other twenty-two or twenty-four. Their strength, however, does\nnot at all correspond with their caliber, nor do they seem in other respects of adequate dimensions. James, who abhorred bloodshed himself, was resolved that his present should not be the instrument of it in others.\n\nThe commerce of the town of Acheen, independent of that of the outports, gives employment to eight or ten Coromandel vessels of 150 or 200 tons burthen, which arrive annually from Portonovo and Coringa about the month of August, and sail again in February and March. The King of Acheen, as is usual with princes in this part of the world, is the chief merchant of his capital, and endeavours to be, to the utmost of his power, the monopolizer of its trade. No duties are paid on goods sold to him, as that is considered in the price. On all purchases of gruff goods by Europeans, such as brickstone, betelnut, rattans, benzoin, camphor, horses, &c., the king's duties are six per cent. There is a ship or two arrives annually from Surat, the property of native merchants there; from Bengal the inhabitants are supplied with opium, taffattas, and muslins; besides which, iron, and many other articles of merchandize, are imported by European traders; but it is necessary that a strict guard be kept on board ship while lying in Acheen harbour, as the risk of being cut off by the Malay pirates is considerable. (Marsden, Forrest, Elmore, &c.)\n\nAckora, (Acara).\u2014A small town in the Afghan territories, in the province of Kabul, 12 miles N. W. from Attock, on the Indus. Lat. 33\u00b0. 14'. N. Long. 71\u00b0. 6'. E.\n\nAckwallah, (Acawali).\u2014A town in the Nizam's dominions, in the province of Berar, 53 miles S. S. W. from Ellichpoor. Lat. 20\u00b0. 42'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 46'. E.\n\nAdanad, (Adinatha).\u2014A town in the province of Malabar, district of Shirnada, celebrated as the throne of the Alvangheri Tamburaeni, or chief of the Namburies, who are the Brahmins of Malabar. These Namburies will neither eat nor drink with the Brahmans of other countries; but, like other Brahmans, they marry and live with their wives, of whom they take as many as they are able to support. A Namburi's children are always considered as his heirs; but in order to prevent their losing dignity by becoming too numerous, the younger sons of a Namburi family seldom marry. They live with their eldest brothers, and assist the wives of the rajas, and other Nairs of distinction, to keep up their families. Many Namburies have lost caste by having committed murder, or by having eaten forbidden things; in such cases their children generally become Mahomedans.\n\nIn the district of Shirnada, the low hills occupy a very large proportion of the country. The soil in most of them consists of a kind of indurated clay, which, on exposure to the air, becomes as hard as a brick. The continuance of the rain in this neighbourhood is sufficient to ensure plenty of water for any crop, that does not require more than four months to come to maturity. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nAdeenagur, (Adinagar).\u2014An Afghan town in the province of Kabul, district of Kanesh, situated on the N. side of the river Kameh, 60 miles E. S. E. from the city of Kabul. Lat. 34\u00b0. 16'. N. Long. 69\u00b0. 34'. E.\n\nAdilabad.\u2014A town in the Nizam's territories, in the province of Berar, 30 miles S. W. from Chandah. Lat. 19\u00b0. 40'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 25'. E.\n\nAdilabad.\u2014A town in the Maharratta dominions, in the province of Khandesh, situated on the N. side of the Poornah river, 20 miles S. from Boorhanpoor. Lat. 21\u00b0. 4'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 23'. E. Near to this place is a lake, held in great veneration by the Hindoos.\n\nAdj River.\u2014A small river which has its source in the Pachete hills, in the province of Bahar, from whence it flows through the district of Birbhum, where, during the rains, it is navigable, and at last falls into the\nHoogly branch of the Ganges near Cutwa.\n\nADJYGHUR.\u2014A strong fortress in the province of Bundelcund, situated at nearly equal distances from Callinjer and Pannah, and commanding a pass through the mountains from the former to the latter place. Within the fort are three large reservoirs of water cut in the solid rock, and the ruins of three magnificent Hindoo temples; the name signifies the impregnable fortress.\n\nIn 1809 it was besieged by the British; and, after a considerable resistance, in which a material loss was sustained by the assailants, evacuated by the garrison. When the family of Lutchman Dowah, the refractory Zemindar of Adjyghur, was ordered to be removed, an old man, his father-in-law, was sent into the women's apartments, to prepare the females for their removal. He not returning after some time had elapsed, the house was entered by the roof, when it was found he had cut the throats of all the women and children, eight in number, and afterwards his own. The deed must have been perpetrated entirely with the consent and assistance of the females, as the persons in waiting at the door never heard the slightest cries while the catastrophe was performing. (11th Asiatic Reg. M. S. &c.)\n\nADONI, (Adawani).\u2014A district in the province of Bejapoor, situated between the 15th and 16th degrees of north latitude, and extending along the south side of the Toombuddra river. To the north it has Rychoor in the Nizam's dominions, and to the south the Geoty hills.\n\nOn the 12th Oct. 1800, this district, along with the tract of country situated south of the Toombuddra and Krishna rivers, was ceded to the British government by the Nizam, when it was completely surveyed and placed under the Bellary collectorship, but the revenue has not yet been permanently assessed. (5th Report, &c.)\n\nADONI.\u2014A town in the province of Bejapoor, the capital of a district of the same name, and situated 145 miles S. W. from Hyderabad in the Deccan. Lat. 15\u00b0 32'. N. Long. 77\u00b0 16'. E.\n\nThis city was taken in 1568 by Ali Adil Shah of Bejaapor, at which period it was placed on the top of a high hill, and contained within its walls many tanks and fountains of pure water, with numerous princely structures. The rajahs of Bijanagur, to whom it before belonged, considered it as impregnable, and an asylum for their families in desperate emergencies; but they lost it with their empire, after the great battle fought with the Deccany Mahommedan sovereigns in 1564.\n\nFor a short time during the 18th century it was the capital of a small independent Patan state, and afterwards became the Jaghire and residence of Bazalet Jung, brother to the late Nizam Ali. In 1787 it was besieged, taken, and destroyed, by Tipu Sultan; and, in 1800, along with the district, was ceded to the British by the Nizam.

E.\nAFGHANISTAN.\n\nAn extensive tract of country to the west of the Indus, stretching from the 30th to the 35th degrees of north lat. and from the city of Candahar to the Indus. This region to the N. W. is bounded by the Hindu Kho mountains, which separate it from the province of Bamian in Persia; to the N. by the countries of Kuttore, or Caffristan; and to the S. by Baloochistan. The Indus river forms the eastern boundary, and the province of Segistan, in Persia, the western. From N. to S. it may be estimated at 350 miles, and the average breadth from E. to W. at 300 miles. Many of the contiguous provinces have been occasionally subject to their sovereigns, but the indigenous country of the Afghan tribes is comprehended within the limits specified. 'Cabal and Candahar, the two principal provinces, are subdivided into numerous districts, and described under their respective heads, to which the reader is referred for further local informations; this article being intended to collect such observations as apply generally to the Afghan nation.\n\nThe country of Afghanistan proper is denominated by the natives Pokhtankha, and is the country adjacent to the town of Peshawer. The district of Hashtanagar is situated in the centre of Afghanistan, and in the early Mahommedan times was named Roh, from whence originated the term Rohillah. Hashtanagar derives its name (which signifies eight townships) from the eight original settlements of the country, which are supposed to correspond with the eight following districts; viz. 1. Nowshehra; 2. Charasada, including Paraug and Hesar; 3. Rezzar; 4. Otmanzei; 5. Turanzei; 6. Amarzei; 7. Sherpai; 8. Tangeh, or Barkazei. This region is universally reckoned by the Afghans the country of their first settlement in Afghanistan.\n\nNingarhar is the name of an extensive tract of country, watered by nine mountain streams, which fall into the river Jelalabad. The country of Ningarhar is irregular and uneven of surface, though it has not any very high mountains. It is about 90 miles in length from east to west, extending from Balikot to Surkhab. In breadth it extends from Caggah, or Cajjah, to the river Lughman, a distance of nearly 30 miles. The inhabitants are chiefly Afghans and Tajics. The ancient capital of the country was Adinaghur; but, as that was difficult of access, and situated at a distance from the principal river, the town of Jelalabad was founded on the great route from Candahar to Peshawer.\n\nThe Afghans, who occupy Ningarhar, are chiefly of the tribes of Mohmand, Khugiani, and Waragzei. Of these the tribes of Mohmand, which is divided into two branches, the Tarakzei and the Balzei, is the most numerous and powerful. This tract of country is now distinguished in the maps by the names of Kamch and Lamghanat, and contains the towns of Adecenagur, Surkhab, and Jelalabad. The term Tajic, in the Mogul language, is said to signify a peasant; but it is generally applied by the Moguls to the natives of Persia, who are neither of Arab nor Mogul extraction.\n\nThe race of Afghans in Hindostan are commonly known by the name of Patans, the meaning or etymology of which designation does not seem to be satisfactorily ascertained. The modern tribes of Afghans are very numerous, but the principal are those of Lodi, Lohauni, Sur, Serwani, Yusefzei, Bungish, Delazai, Khatti, Yazin, Khail, and Baloje. By the best Persian historians the Afghans are said to be descended from the Jews, and Sir William Jones considered their language as a dialect of the scriptural Chaldaic.\n\nThe inhabitants of Afghanistan have no peculiar written character, but their language is distinct from that of the surrounding nations. In some\nhistories of Asia, the Afghans are described as Tartars, but they bear no resemblance to this people, either in person, manner, or dialect. They are a hardy, robust race of men; and, being addicted to a state of predatory warfare, have a fixed contempt for the occupations of civil life. Bread of wheat and barley, milk, butter, and cheese, compose their usual diet. Throughout Hindostan the Afghan character is of the very worst description, and they are reprobed as ferocious, sanguinary, and treacherous; but being a brave and hardy race, they are, notwithstanding their grievous faults, much sought after, and entertained as soldiers by the native powers.\n\nThe Gujars of Afghanistan are of the same race as those who occupy the mountains of the Punjabs and Upper Hindostan. In some districts they are nearly as numerous as the Afghans, especially in the territories of the tribe of Mandar, which form an extensive district about 100 miles long, and 60 in breadth. Before the time of Ameer, all the Zendars of Mandar were of the Gujar race; but the Afghans had occupied the mountains at a more early period; and, descending from these, they gradually possessed themselves of the plains. The Gujars of Afghanistan are still a brave people, of pastoral habits, whose wealth consists chiefly in cattle, and particularly in buffaloes. They are still numerous in the district of Hashtanagur.\n\nIt is probable that not 1-50th part of this vast country is under a state of permanent cultivation. Most of the genuine Afghan tribes are migratory, and dwell in tents, and subsist on the produce of their flocks; such as are more stationary in their habits, are but little addicted to agriculture. In the south, Afghanistan is a barren desert of sand, and to the north of Kabul it is a savage and mountainous country. The central part through which the Cow and Kabul rivers flow, is fertile, and under a tranquil government might be rendered extremely productive; but this is a small portion of the whole: The population is, consequently, very unequal to the extent of territory; and, probably, does not exceed three millions of inhabitants of all descriptions. Of these, a very great proportion are Mahomedans of the Soonee persuasion, the Hindoos being few, and chiefly settled in the towns and villages as merchants, shopkeepers, and bankers.\n\nThe Hazareh are a distinct race from either the Afghans or Moguls, although their tribes are intermixed with these and other races. Their original seat is said to have been the country between Herat and Balk; but their possessions extend much wider, and they occupy a considerable part of the country between Ghizni and Candahar in one direction, and between Maidan and Balk on the other. They are, probably, of Pehlavi extraction.\n\nThe armies of the state are composed of a diversity of nations, but the best troops are drawn from the Afghan districts. Cavalry constitute the chief military strength; a serviceable horse, in this country, costing only about six pounds sterling. A corps of infantry, armed with matchlocks, composes also a part of the Afghan armies.\n\nThe cities and towns of Afghanistan are chiefly inhabited by Hindoos and Mahomedans of the Punjab, who were established by the former princes of Hindostan to introduce commerce and civilization; many families of Persian and Tartar extraction are also dispersed in different parts of the country: the former are denominated Parsewans, the other Moguls; but both have adopted the use of the Persian language.\n\nThe Afghans received the religion of Mahommed from their Tartar conquerors, and like them profess the Sooni creed, but they are by no means strict in the performance of their religious duties, and their country has been the seat of many heresies, mostly propagated by the sword. The nature of their sovereignty is\ndespotie,\" but when not constrained by some extraordinary power or capacity of the reigning prince, they disperse into societies, and resemble a feudal government.\n\nCertain territories of Afghanistan were conquered in the ninth century by the Khans of Bokhara, of the Samani race, and annexed to the Tartar principality of Khorasan, from whence a subordinate chief was deputed to govern at Ghizni; but it does not appear that the northern part of the country was subdued until the reign of Mahmood, the second prince of the Ghiznavi race, who completed the conquest of Afghanistan.\n\nNo substantial tradition of the Afghans, or of the state of their country, is found on record until the year of the Christian era A.D. 997, when Sebuctaghi, a Tartar officer in the service of the Khorasan chief, who at that period was himself subject to Munsur at Samani, the great Khan of Bokhara, succeeded to the territory, renounced the Tartar vassalage, and extending his conquests to Afghanistan, made Ghizni the capital of his empire.\n\nThe Ghiznavi dominions were chiefly acquired by Mahmood, the son of Sebuctaghi, and comprehended a large portion of Persia and Hindostan. This dynasty flourished for the space of 207 years, until A.D. 1159, when the power was wrested from it by the Afghan, Mahommed Ghori. This prince left to a favourite slave, named Eldoze, his possessions west of the Indus, which were soon overrun by the Persian Prince of Kharizm, whose successor, Jillal ud Deen, was conquered and expelled by Gengis Khan.\n\nFrom this period until the invasion of Tamerlane, the Afghan history is involved in obscurity. In the year 1561, Ferishta mentions that Mahmood, a Patan King of Delhi, drove the Moguls from Ghizni, and annexed it to the empire of Hindostan. It is probable it continued subject to the Delhi throne, until Timour's expedition into India in 1398, when the northern quarter of Afghanistan became a Mogul province.\n\nAfter Timour's death, when the great fabric of the Samareand Mogul empire fell to pieces, we may presume it was governed by its native chiefs until 1506, at which period the Emperor Baber, prior to his invasion of Hindostan, seized on Kabul and Ghizni, which, with Candahar occasionally, were held by his posterity until the death of Aurengzebe (who, in 1678, subdued an insurrection of the Afghans), after which event its subjection was scarcely nominal. About A.D. 1720, the Afghans, under their native chiefs, conquered Persia; but, in 1737, were expelled by Nadir Shah from that country, and their own subjugated. In 1739, after the capture of Delhi by Nadir Shah, Afghanistan was, by treaty, annexed to the Persian empire.\n\nOn the assassination of that conqueror in 1747, Ahmed Shah Abdalli seized on the Afghan territories, and having run through a long and arduous military career, died in 1773. By a decisive and sanguinary victory at Paniput, in 1761, he arrested the progress of the Maharatta conquests, which menaced the Mahomedan princes with total expulsion from Hindostan.\n\nHe was succeeded by his son, Timour Shah, who was at an early period obliged to relinquish Lahore to the Seiks. On the east of the Indus he still retained the province of Cashmere, the district of Attock, with some scattered portions of Mooltan, and received tribute from the Amurs of Sinde. He likewise possessed a large division of Khorasan, which, including the city of Herat, extends on the north to the vicinity of Nishabur and Tarshish, and on the south to the lesser Irak.\n\nTimour Shah died in 1792, after a reign of 19 years, leaving 19 sons. To the eldest, Humayoon, he gave the sovereignty of Herat and Candahar; to Zemauin Shah, Kabul and the rest of his Afghan territories, as well\nas Cashmere and Mooltan. Humayoon was afterwards dethroned and blinded by his brother Zemaun Shah, who, in 1796, advanced as far as Lahore with an army of 23,000 cavalry, caused great alarm in Hindostan, and retreated.\n\nIn 1802 Zemaun Shah was de-throned and deprived of sight by his brother Mahmood Shah, who was shortly after expelled and pardoned by his brother Sujah ul Mook, against whom he rebelled in 1809, in which year Sujah ul Mook\u2019s army was discomfited, and his standard abandoned by most of his chieftains, Mahommmed Khan, the viceroy of Cashmere, taking advantage of these dissensions, in 1809 erected the flag of independence in that province, which still continues unsubdued, and the subjection of the other districts composing the Afghan empire little more than nominal.

Long. 76\u00b0 3'. E. To the south of this town, which is subject to Sindia, is a fine lake. (Hunter, &c.)\n\n---\n\nAGRA.\n\nA large province in Hindostan, situated principally between the 25th and 28th degrees of north latitude. It is bounded on the north by the province of Delhi, on the south by that of Malwah; on the east it has the provinces of Oude and Allahabad, and on the west that of Ajmeer. In length it may be estimated at 250 miles by 180 the average breadth. In the institutes of Acher, compiled by Abdul Fazel, A.D. 1582, this province is described as follows:\n\n\"The soubah of Agra is situated in the second climate. In length from Ghatimpoor (Gautumpoor) which confines it on the side of Allahabad, to Pulwall, the boundary towards Delhi, it measures 175 coss; its breadth is from Kanoge to Chandree in Malwa. This soubah contains 13 districts, viz. 1. Agra; 2. Calpee; 3. Canoge; 4. Cowl; 5. Gualior; 6. Irej; 7. Sanwau; 8. Narwar; 9. Mundlayer; 10. Alvar; 11. Tejareh; 12. Narnoul; 13. Sehar. These districts are subdivided into 203 pergunnahs. The amount of the revenue is 1,61,56,257 rupees. It furnishes 50,600 cavalry, 477,570 infantry, and 221 elephants.\"\n\nThe surface of this province, north of the Chumbul, is in general flat and open, and rather bare of trees; but south of that river, and also towards the north western frontier, it is more hilly, and trees become more plentiful. The climate for the greater part of the year is temperate, and during the winter months actually cold; but while the hot winds prevail, like the other central countries of Hindostan, the heat is intense, and the climate generally unhealthy. Fortunately their continuance is not of long duration.\n\nThe chief rivers in this province are the Jumna, the Chumbul, and the Ganges, besides which there are many smaller streams; but, upon the whole, this country is indifferently supplied with water, and during the dry season to the north of the Chumbul, except in the immediate vicinity of the rivers, water for agricultural purposes is procured from wells. A great proportion of the cultivation is consequently restricted to such crops as do not, like rice, require a redundant supply of moisture. The soil is particularly adapted for the production of indigo, which might be raised in any quantity, as also sugar and cotton; but except in that portion of the province under the British jurisdiction, all processes of agriculture are in a very backward state, owing to the confusion and incessant warfare by which the province has been distracted ever since the death of Aurengzebe in 1707. In this province there are no remarkable or peculiar mineral productions, and the animals are the same as in Hindostan generally, but the horses are\nmuch superior to those of Bengal and the more eastern and southern provinces.\n\nThe principal article manufactured in this province is coarse cloth, but the export of it is not great. The British provinces to the south-east receive annually an importation of cotton from the south of the Chumbul, by the route of Calpee, but a considerable proportion of it is the growth of Malwah, and the Maharatta territories to the south-east of Agra. The Doab, or territory between the Ganges and the Jumna, which may be termed the garden of the province, exports indigo, sugar, and cotton. The country to the north-west of Agra, under the Macherry Rajah of Alva and other native chiefs, being ill supplied with water, is of a very inferior quality, and generally unproductive. Upon the whole, the province is but thinly peopled compared with Bengal, Tanjore, and the more flourishing of the British provinces, and does not, probably, in all its dimensions, contain more than six millions of inhabitants. The Doab, and that part of it possessed by the British, is by far the most fertile, populous, and best governed. At present this province is partitioned nearly in the following manner:\n\nThe north-western and western districts, to the north of the Chumbul, are possessed by the Rajahs of Macherry and Bhurtpoor, and other native chiefs in alliance with the British government, who form a protecting boundary towards the dominions of the Ajmeer Rajpoot chiefs, and those of the Malwah Maharattas.\n\nAll the territory to the east of the Jumna, and a small district round the city of Agra, is possessed by the British government, which has there instituted a regular civil establishment for the collection of the revenue, and the administration of justice.\n\nThe country to the south of the Chumbul, comprehending Gualior, Gohud, Narwar, &c. with the exception of the town and district of Calpee, are either in the possession of, or tributary to, the Maharattas, who, by this arrangement, are shut out from the north of Hindostan.\n\nThe principal towns in this province are Alvar, the capital of the Macherry Rajah; Bhurtpoor, the capital of the Jauts; Deeg, another strong Jaut fortress; Mathura, Kanoge, Etawch, Gualior, Gohud, Calpee, and Narwar. The natives of this province are, in general, a handsome robust race of men, and consist of a mixture of Hindoos and Mahommedans, few of the Seiks having yet come so far south. A considerable number of the cultivators to the west of the Jumna are Jauts, who are a Hindoo tribe, which religion still predominates, although the province has been permanently subject, since the 13th century, to the Mahommedans. The language of common intercourse throughout the Agra province is the Hindostany, but the Persian is used for public and official documents, and in conversation among the higher classes of Mahommedans. The ancient language of Kanoge is thought, by Mr. Colebrooke, to form the basis of the modern Hindostany.\n\nIn the remote ages of Hindoo antiquity, this province must have formed a very important portion of Hindostan, as it contained Kanoge, Mathura, and Bindraund, the seats of their most famous empires, and still among their most venerated places of pilgrimage. The city of Agra is also supposed to have been the birthplace of the Avatar, or incarnation of Vishna, under the name of Parasu Rama, whose conquests extended to and included Ceylon. After the Mahommedan conquest it followed the fate of Delhi, and during the reign of Acber, was the leading province of the empire. Subsequent to the death of Aurengzebe, in 1707, it was alternately possessed and ravaged by the Jauts, Maharattas, and different chiefs deputed from Delhi, to restore the royal authority. One\nof the latter, Nudjiff Khan, governed this province north of the Chumbul from 1777 to his death, independent of all control from the Delhi sovereigns. (Abul Fazel, Scott, Colebrooke, Wilford, &c.)\n\nAgra.\u2014A small district in the province of Agra, in the immediate vicinity of the city of Agra. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Agra contains 33 mahals; measurement 9,107,622 begahs; revenue, 191,719,265 dams. Seyurgal, 14,566,818 dams. This Sircar furnishes 11,560 cavalry, and 106,800 infantry.\"\n\nThe country immediately to the south of Agra is flat and open, and tolerably well cultivated, but bare of trees. During the cold season the tanks, streams, and rivulets, are quite dry, and water for agricultural and domestic purposes is procured from wells. Since 1804 this district has been under the British jurisdiction.\n\nAgra.\u2014A city in the province of Agra, of which it is the capital, situated on the S.W. side of the river Jumna. Lat. 27\u00b0 12'. N. Long. 77\u00b0 56'. E. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"Agra is a large city, the air of which is esteemed very healthy. The river Jumna runs through it for five coss. The Emperor Acber founded here a most magnificent city. In former times Agra was a village, dependent on Biana.\"\n\nThe most remarkable edifice in modern Agra is the Taj Mahal, a mausoleum erected by the Emperor Shah Jehan, for the celebrated Noor Jehan Begum. It is situated on the southern banks of the Jumna, about three miles from the fort of Agra, and is built entirely of white marble. It is enclosed within a space of 300 yards, extending along the river, and is nearly 190 yards square. The dome rises from the centre, and is about 70 feet in diameter.\n\nThe houses in Agra consist of several stories, like those in Benares, and the streets are so narrow as scarcely to admit a palanqueen. The greatest part of this once flourishing city is now a heap of ruins, and almost uninhabited. Six miles to the north Agra is the mausoleum of Acber at Secudra. From the summit of the Minaret, in front of it, a spectator's eye may range over a great circuit of country, not less than 30 miles in a direct line. The whole of this space is flat, and filled with the ruins of ancient grandeur; at a distance the river Jumna is seen, and the glittering towers of Agra.\n\nIn the month of June the river Jumna, at Agra, is about half a mile broad, and it is not fordable here at any season. The city rises from the river, extending in a vast semicircle. The fort, in which is included the imperial palace, is of great extent. This city was greatly enlarged and embellished in 1566, by the Emperor Acber, who made it his capital; and it has also the honour of being the birth-place of Abul Fazel, his prime minister. It was taken by Madajee Sindia, and continued in the possession of the Maharattas until 1803, when it was captured by the British army under General Lake, after a short and vigorous siege. It has ever since remained in the possession of the British government, and is the seat of a civil establishment for the collection of the revenue, and the administration of justice.\n\nTravelling distance from Delhi 137 miles; from Calcutta by Birbloom, 830 miles.

E.\n\nThis place is situated in a level country, on the banks of a small navigable river named the Sabernaty, which, together with other conluent streams, falls into the gulf of Cambay, near the city of Cambay, which is properly the port of Ahmedabad; distant about 56 road miles about the middle of the 15th cen.\ntury this city was the capital of a flourishing independent empire, particularly during the reign of Mahmood Begra, A.D. 1450, but it has since fallen greatly to decay. It still remains one of the best fortified towns in the province, and made a good defence when taken by General Goddard in 1789. It was restored to the Maharattas at the peace of 1783, and with them it still continues. A great proportion of the itinerant musicians, players, and poets, named bhawasee, or rassaree, so common throughout Gujrat, come from the neighbourhood of this town. In the Gujrattee villages their performances are paid for at the public expense, as are also the bands of jugglers and wrestlers.\n\nTravelling distance from Bombay 321 miles; from Poonah, 389; from Delhi, 610; and from Calcutta by Oojain, 1234 miles.

Nominal sovereigns of this family existed at Dowletabad until 1634, when it was also taken, and the Nizam Shahee dominions became a province of the Mogul empire.\n\nAhmednuggur continued under the government of the Delhi sovereigns until the death of Aurengzebe, in 1707, when it was at a very early period seized on by the Maharattas, and continued part of the Peshwa's dominions until 1797, when Dowlet Row Sindia forced the Peshwa to cede to him this important fortress, with the surrounding district; by which cession he not only obtained the command of the city of Poonah, but the best entrance into the territories of the Peshwa and of our ally, the Nizam.\n\nOn the 12th of August, 1803, this city was taken by General Wellesley, and ceded to the British by Dowlet Row Sindia at the treaty of peace concluded on the 30th December, 1803.

The soil of this soubah is sandy, and it is necessary to dig a great depth before water can be procured; so that the success of the harvest entirely depends on the periodical rains. The winter is temperate; but the summer is intensely hot. To the south are mountains, this province abounding in strong holds. This soubah comprehends Meywar, Marwar, and Nadowty, which are separated into seven districts, subdivided into 197 pergunnahs. The names of the districts are, 1. Ajmeer; 2. Chitore; 3. Rantanpoor; 4. Joudpoor; 5. Sarowy; 6. Nagore; 7. Bicanere. The measured lands are 21,435,961 begahs; the amount of the revenue, 22,841,507 dams; out of which 2,326,336 dams are Seyurghal. It can furnish 86,500 infantry, and 347,000 cavalry.\"\nIn delineating this province, Abul Fazel appears to have too much compressed its limits towards the south, where were the principal Rajpoot tributary states, which probably in his time had been but little explored. The province of Ajmeer is occasionally named Marwar; but this appellation is properly restricted to the Joudpoor territories.\n\nThe northern division of this province, comprehending Bicauere and the neighbouring districts, is a barren, unfruitful plain, bare of trees, and almost destitute of rivers and rivulets, and but very thinly inhabited; the central territory, which includes Joudpoor and Jyenagur, is more hilly, and better supplied with water, yet not in sufficient quantities for wet crops. The soil is also of a remarkable saline nature, containing salt lakes and springs, and producing salt and saltpetre spontaneously. The southern division is very hilly and of difficult access; but, in general, well covered with trees and shrubs, and watered by many mountain streams, besides the Banass and Chunbul rivers.\n\nThe three grand modern divisions of Ajmeer, or Rajpootana, are, 1st, The state of Odeypoor, named also Mewar, or the Rana of Chitore; 2dly, Joudpoor, named also Marwar, and its sovereign occasionally described as the Rhatore Rajah, being of that tribe; 3dly, Jyenagur, Jeypoor, or Ambeer.\n\nUnder these heads respectively, and the names of the chief towns, further topographical details will be found; it being intended here only to exhibit a general view of the province, which is at present partitioned in the following manner:\n\nThe city of Ajmeer, and the forty-six surrounding pergunnahs, belong to Dowlet Row Sindia, and the district of Tonk Rampoorah to the Hoicar family.\n\nThe eastern quarter of the central division is occupied by the Jeynagur Rajah; and the south eastern by the Rajahs of Kotah, Boonde, and other petty Rajpoot chiefs tributary to the Mahrattas, and engaged in a constant state of hostilities with each other.\n\nThe western parts of the central division are subject to the Rajah of Jondpoor, whose dominions are of great extent; and the south-western are possessed by the Rana of Odeypoor.\n\nFrom these principalities the Malwah Maharattas, when they are strong enough, levy annual contributions, which is the easier effected, on account of their disunion and increasing internal warfare. Respecting the barren and desolate region to the north, very little is known, as it has yet, from its poverty, attracted but little attention.\n\nThe constitution of these countries is feudal; each district, town, and even village, being governed by petty chiefs, dignified with the title of Thakoor, or Lord, who frequently yield but a nominal obedience to the person who is reputed to be their superior or sovereign. The rents are very low; but every village is obliged to furnish a certain number of horsemen at the shortest notice. The Rajpoots are hardy and brave, and extremely attached to their respective chiefs; they are much addicted to the use of opium\u2014this destructive drug being produced by them on all occasions, and presented to visitors as betel in other parts of India. They are usually divided into two tribes\u2014the Rhatore, and the Chohan Seesodya Rajpoots.\n\nRespecting the number of inhabitants but a very vague estimate can be formed; but, by comparison with certain other districts, the numbers of which have been ascertained, although occupying so great a space, the population in all probability does not exceed five millions; and of those not above one-tenth are Mahommedans. The principal towns are Jeynagur, Joudpoor, Odeypoor, Ajmeer, Kotah, Boondee, Rantampoor, Chitore, Amber, and Shalpoorah.\n\nAlthough this province occupies\nthe centre of Hindostan, and its eastern frontier is within 90 miles of Delhi; it was never thoroughly subjugated either by the Patan or Mogul Emperors. Rajahs of Ajmeer are mentioned by Ferishta so early as A.D. 1008; at which period they joined a combination of Hindu princes against Mahmood of Ghizni, and in 1193 it was conquered, or rather overrun by Mahommed, the first Gauride sovereign of India. After this date it continued tributary to the throne of Delhi; and, on account of the refractory conduct of its princes, was frequently invaded by the emperors, who repeatedly took and destroyed all their chief towns. Yet the province never became a regular organized possession, like Delhi, Agra, and many much more remote countries, but remained in a sort of half-independent state, paying a tribute, and furnishing the imperial armies with a certain number of Rajpoot mercenaries, who were always held in high estimation, on account of their bravery and fidelity, and formed a counterpoise to the Moguls and Afghans.\n\nAfter Aurungzebe's death, in 1707, and the dissolution of the Mogul empire, which soon ensued, it continued for some time under a nominal subjection to the Delhi throne; but, about 1748, assumed total independence. The interval since that period has been filled up by internal warfare, and invasions by the Marathas and other hordes of plunderers. During the latter part of the reign of Madhajee Sindia, and the commencement of that of Dowlet Row Sindia, they were very nearly completely subdued by the disciplined troops under Generals Du Boigne and Perron in the pay of those chiefs. They have since recovered a little, not by any intrinsic addition to their own strength, but by the depression of their most dangerous adversary, Dowlet Row Sindia, who does not now possess the same powerful means of enforcing his extortions. In 1807, the Rajahs of Jy\u00e9nagur and Joudpoor continued their mutual pretensions to marry the daughter of the Raja of Odeypoor, and engaged in hostilities, which were fermented and supported by Ameer Khan, Holkar, Sindia, and other depredators, who benefit by the dissensions among the Rajpoots. (Abul Fazel, Rewel, Scott, Broughton, Maurice MS. &c.)\n\nAjmeer.\u2014A town in the province of Ajmeer, of which it is the capital. Lat. 26\u00b0 35'. N. Long. 74\u00b0 48'. E.\n\nThis town, and the surrounding district, containing forty-six pargunahs, are subject to Dowlet Row Sindia. It is situated in the centre of the Rajpoot states of Jy\u00e9nagur, Joudpoor, and Odeypoor, was formerly rented by Ambajee, and since his death continued to his brother Balarow. In 1800 it was held by M. Perron. The boundary to the west is at the town of Meeria, which separates Ajmeer from Joudpoor.\n\nThe fort of Ajmeer, named Taragur, is built on the north-east end of a range of hills, and consists principally of a plain stone wall along the edge of the mountain, strengthened with a few round bastions. The city lies at the bottom of the hill, and is surrounded by a stone wall and ditch in bad repair. The streets are narrow and dirty, and most of the houses small, and in a state of decay. It still possesses a palace, built in a garden by Shah Jehan; besides which, there are scarcely any remains of magnificence to be seen, either internally or externally.\n\nThe whole country round Ajmeer forms a flat sandy amphitheatre, surrounded by low ranges of hills, in consequence of which the place is uncommonly sultry; but it is well supplied with water from two lakes, which are close under its walls. The most northern is six miles in circumference, and very deep; and, at particular seasons, both are covered with flocks of ducks and geese.\n\nThe principal attraction of Ajmeer is the tomb of Khaja Moyen ud Deen, one of the greatest Mahomedan saints that ever flourished in Hind.\ndostan, which happened about six hundred years ago. It is of white marble, but remarkable neither for beauty nor style of architecture. Although the distance from this tomb to Agra be 230 miles, yet the great and wise Emperor Acher made a pilgrimage on foot to the tomb of this saint, to implore divine blessings on his family, which consisted only of daughters; but, after this pilgrimage, received the addition of three sons. The peer zadas, or attendant priests, who subsist on the contributions at the tomb, exceed 1160 in number, and demand, or rather extort charity from all visitors. Madhajee and Dowlet Row Sindia, although Hindoos, were remarkable for their devotion to Mahommedan saints and customs. The latter bestowed a superb pall and canopy of cloth and gold on the tomb, and is particularly bountiful to the devotees and peer zadas. Four miles from this city is a remarkable place of Hindoo pilgrimage named Pooshkur, or Pokur.\n\nJehangeer, the son and successor of the Emperor Acher, occasionally kept his court here, which caused the embassy of Sir Thomas Rowe, in 1616, when the East India Company had a factory established here. Ajmeer, or Ajnida, is derived from the name of an ancient monarch who ruled the province.\n\nTravelling distance from Delhi 230 miles; from Oojain, 256; from Bombay, 650; and from Calcutta, 1030 miles. (Broughton, Remel, &c.)\n\nAklooss.\u2014A town in the Maharratta territories, in the province of Bejapoor, near Assodnagur, with a fort and well-supplied bazar. This place is nearly a mile in length, and has several handsome wells and buildings. The Nera river is a little to the north of the town, and during the rains is about 100 yards broad. (Moor, &c.)\n\nAkrauny.\u2014A town in the Maharratta territories, in the province of Khandesh; 82 miles E. N. E. from Surat. Lat. 21\u00b0. 40'. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 14'. E.\n\nAlacananda River.\u2014This river springs from the Himalaya mountains, in the province of Scrinagur, and joins the Bhagirathi at Devaprayaga; the junction of the two forming the Ganges.\n\nA very short distance to the north of Bhadrinath, the breadth of the Alacananda does not exceed 18 or 20 feet, and the stream is shallow, and moderately rapid. Further up, the stream is concealed under immense heaps of snow, which probably have been accumulating here for ages. Beyond this point travellers have not dared to venture, although the shastras mention a place called Alacapura, the fabulous city of Cuvera, the Plutus of Hindoo mythology. At the junction at Devaprayaga, the Alacananda is the largest river of the two, being 142 feet in breadth, and rising in the rainy season 46 and 47 feet above the low waterlevel. At Ranibaugh the breadth of the Alacananda is from 70 to 80 yards, with a current of seven and eight miles an hour.\n\nIn this river are a great many fish of the roher species, (Cyprinus deniculatus) four or five feet in length. They are daily fed by the Brahmins, and are so tame as to take bread out of the hand. There is also a species of fish named roher, six or seven feet long: the scales on the back and sides are large, of a beautiful green, encircled with a bright golden border; the belly white, slightly tinged with gold colour; the tail and fins of a dark bronze. The flavour of this fish is equal to its colour, being remarkably fine and delicate. (Raper, &c.)\n\nAllestar.\u2014A town in the peninsula of Malacea, district of Queda, where the sovereign of the latter principality resides, in a small brick fort, built about 1785. It stands two or three leagues up a river, and has a very mean appearance. The royal palace resembles a spacious farm house, with many low houses attached to it, which contain the king's scraglio.\nThe inhabitants are composed of Chulias, (from the Malabar coast) Malays, and Chinese; the last have a temple here. In 1770, Allestar was plundered and burned by the Bugesses, in conjunction with the king's own relations. (Dalrymple, Hauzel, &c.)\n\nAlforeze.\u2014See Borneo.\n\nAlibunder.\u2014A town subject to the Amcers in the province of Sinde, situated in Lat. 24\u00b0 26' N., nine miles east from Cuddren. At this place a small branch of the Goonee river is stopped by a mound of earth, which separates it from Luckput Bunder river. A great many camels may be procured here for the conveyance of baggage. (Maxfield, &c.)\n\nAlima.\u2014A small river in the province of Coimbetoor, on which the town of Aninaylaya is situated.\n\nAlishung, (Arishan).\u2014A district in the north-eastern extremity of Afghanistan, situated between the 35th and 36th degrees of north latitude. On the north, south, and west, it is bounded by mountains; and on the east by Kuttore, or Cafliristan: the chief town is Penjshehr. Respecting this mountainous region, we have had, in modern times, but little information: by Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\u2014\"The district Alishung is surrounded by large mountains, covered with snow, in which is the source of the river Alishung: the inhabitants are called Cadres. Tooman Alishung, 3,701,150 dams.\"\n\nAt present the district is occupied by various wild Afghan tribes, nominally subordinate to the sovereign of Cabul. (Abul Fazel, &c.)\n\nALLAHABAD.\n\nA large province in Hindostan, situated between the 24th and 26th degrees of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by the provinces of Oude and Agra; on the south by the Hindoo province of Gundwana; on the east it has the provinces of Bahar and Gundwana; and on the west, Malwah and Agra. In length it may be estimated at 270 miles, by 120 the average breadth. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, this province is described as follows:\n\n\"Soubah Allahabad is situated in the second climate. Its length, from Sunjowly Jionpoor to the southern provinces, is 160 coss; and the breadth, from Chowsa Ferry to Gautumpoor, includes 122 coss. To the east it has Bahar; on the north, Oude; Baundhoo (Gundwana) lies on the south, and Agra on the west. The principal rivers of this soubah are the Ganges and Junna; besides which are the Aruna, the Geyn, the Scroo, the Biruah, and several smaller ones. This soubah contains ten districts; viz. 1. Allahabad; 2. Ghazipoor; 3. Benares; 4. Jionpoor; 5. Maniepoor; 6. Chunar; 7. Bahtgorah; 8. Callinjer; 9. Korah; 10. Kurrah. These districts are subdivided into 177 pargannahs; the revenue being 53,10,695 sicca rupees, and 1,200,000 betel nut leaves. It furnishes 11,375 cavalry, 237,870 infantry, and 323 elephants.\"\n\nIn the reign of Aurengzebe the arrangement of this province was new modelled; the division of Bhatta or Baundhoo, which belongs properly to Gundwana, having been added to it. This territory was then considered as a new conquest, though long before partially subjected, and was subdivided into six lesser districts; viz. 1. Bhatta; 2. Sohagpoor; 3. Chotceesgur, or Ruttenpoor; 4. Sumbulpoor; 5. Gangpoor; and, 6. Jushpoor, and formally annexed to the province of Allahabad. With this addition of 25,000 square miles of a high mountainous unproductive country, Allahabad then comprehended 60,000 square miles; but as this tract was never thoroughly reduced to subjection, or occupied, it is proper it should be restored to the province of Gundwana, where in remote antiquity it composed part of the Goand state of Gurrah.\n\nIn 1747 the subdivisions of this province were, 1. Allahabad; 2. Kurrah\n3. Korah; 4. Tarhar; 5. Manicpoor; 6. Benares; 7. Jionpoor; 8. Ghazipoor; 9. Chunar; 10. Callinger; 11. Ahmedabad Gohrah; 12. Bhatta, &c.\n\nThe surface of this province in the vicinity of the rivers Ganges and Jumna is flat and productive; but to the south-west, in the Bundelcund territory, the country is an elevated table land, diversified with high hills, and abounding in strong holds. This part of the province is indifferently cultivated, but contains within its limits the famous diamond mines of Pannah. Between these two divisions there is a considerable difference of climate; the former being extremely sultry, and subject to the hot winds, which is not the case with the more elevated region.\n\nThe principal rivers in the north are the Ganges, Jumna, Goomty, and Caramasa, besides many smaller streams, which supply abundance of water, and render several of the districts, such as Benares and Allahabad, among the most fertile in Hindostan. In the hilly country to the south west, the rivers are few and smaller, the Cane and Coggra being the principal. The periodical rains and wells are, consequently, in this quarter, chiefly depended on for a supply of moisture; but, upon the whole, Allahabad may be considered one of the richest and most productive countries in India.\n\nThe exports from this province are diamonds, saltpetre, opium, sugar, indigo, cotton, cotton cloths, &c. the imports are various; salt from the maritime parts of Bengal being one of the principal articles in demand.\n\nThe chief towns are Benares, Allahabad, Callinger, Chatterpoor, Jionpoor, Mirzapoor, Chunar, and Gazypoor. The population of Allahabad is very considerable, and may be estimated to exceed seven millions, of which number, probably, 1-8th are Mahomedans, and the rest Hindoos of the Brahminical persuasion. In remote times of Hindoo antiquity, this province must have held a high rank, as it contains Prayaga (Allahabad) and Benares, two of the most holy places of Hindoo pilgrimage, and the latter occupying in India the station which two centuries back Rome did in Christendom. At present, the whole of this extensive province is comprehended within the limits of the British jurisdiction, and governed by the Bengal code of regulations, with the exception of a small portion of the Bundelcund province, which still continues in a refractory state.\n\nWe learn from Abul Fazel, that this province was invaded so early as A.D. 1020, by Sultan Mahmood of Ghizni, the scourge of the Hindoos, who made a few compulsory converts to the Mahomedan faith. He returned again, A.D. 1023, but made no permanent establishment. It was afterwards wholly subdued by the Patan Emperors of Delhi; and, during the 15th century, contained an independent kingdom, the seat of which was Jionpoor. Along with the other Patan conquests, it devolved to the Moguls, and was formed into a distinct soubah by the Emperor Acber, who named the Hindoo sanctuary or prayaga, Allahabad, an appellation it still retains.\n\nAfter the fall of the Mogul dynasty, the northern quarter was appropriated by the Nabobs of Oude; but, in 1764, Korah and Allahabad were ceded to Shah Allum, the then fugitive sovereign of Delhi, through the interference of Lord Clive with the Nabob of Oude, Sujah ud Dowlah. In 1772 they reverted to the latter, when that ill-advised monarch returned to Delhi, and put himself in the custody of the Maharattas.\n\nThe Bengal government acquired the Benares districts by treaty with Asoph ad Dowlah, in 1775, and Allahabad, with the adjacent territory, in 1801, by cession from Saadet Ali of Oude. The south-eastern districts of Bundelcund were received from the Maharatta Peshwa in 1803, in exchange for an equivalent of territory in the Carnatic, Balaghan, and...\nGujrat. (Abul Fazel, J. Grant, 5th Report, Ironside, &c.)\n\nAllahabad.\u2014A district in the province of Allahabad, immediately surrounding the city of Allahabad, and intersected by the Ganges and the Jumna.\n\nWheat in this district is a principal crop, the land most favourable to it being a rich sandy loam, which is a very common soil here. The commencement of the rains in June is the season when they begin to plough, and only a single stirring is given until they cease. The field is then ploughed 15 different times before the reception of the seed, a circumstance which proves the inefficacy of the Indian plough. September and October are the months for sowing. During the dry season the land must be watered, which is a much more laborious task than the cultivation. Four bullocks and three waterers are with difficulty able to water an acre in nine days; the average crop is reckoned 15 mannads per begah, (seven quarters per acre.) Barley, peas, oil crops, and a yellow die, are often mixed with the wheat. The average rent of wheat land is about one pound per acre.\n\nThe breed of sheep in this district is small, even for India, and the fleece consists of a coarse black hair, altogether unsuitable for cloth. Small rugs are made of it for shepherds. The dress of the peasantry consists of a small piece of coarse cloth round his middle, generally with one blanket, and a sort of turban made of a cotton clout, which articles compose their whole wardrobe. (Temnant, &c.)\n\nAllahabad.\u2014A fortified town in the province of Allahabad, of which it is the capital, situated at the confluence of the Ganges with the Jumna. Lat. 25\u00b0. 27'. N. Long. 81\u00b0. 50'.\n\nThis city does not make a handsome appearance, there being only a few brick buildings without ornaments. The fort is placed at some distance on a tongue of land, one side being washed by the Jumna, and the other nearly approaching the Ganges. It is lofty and extensive, and completely commands the navigation of the two rivers. There are, probably, few buildings of equal size in Europe. Next the two rivers it is defended by the old walls, with the addition of some cannon. The third side, next the land, is perfectly regular, and very strong. It has three ravelins, two bastions, and a half bastion, and stands higher than any ground in front of it. The gateway is Grecian, and elegant. The government-house is spacious and cool, and has some large subterranean rooms overhanging the river. In the same line, another building has been modernized and converted into barracks for the non-commissioned officers. In the angle is a square, where Shah Allum had his seraglio when he resided here. Up to 1803 the sum expended on the fortifications amounted to 12 lacks of rupees, and they are now quite impregnable to a native army; to an European army a regular siege would be necessary; it is, consequently, the grand military depot of the upper provinces.\n\nThe situation of Allahabad being alike adapted for the purposes of internal commerce and defence, must have early pointed it out as an eligible spot for the foundation of a city, and most probably it is the site of the ancient Palibothra. Nine-tenths of the present native buildings are of mud, raised on the foundations of more substantial brick edifices, which have long fallen to decay. The inhabitants, exclusive of the garrison, are estimated at 20,000. The soil in the vicinity consists of brick dust, mortar, and broken pottery. The Ganges is here about a mile broad, and does not appear to be much augmented by the tribute of so large a river as the Jumna, although the latter is 1400 yards across.\n\nBy the Brahmins Allahabad is named Bhat Prayag, or by way of distinction, as it is the largest and most holy, is simply designated by the name of Prayaga. The other from Prayagas, or sacred confluences\nof rivers, are situated in the province of Srinagar, at the junction of the Alacaananda with other streams, and are named Devaprayaga, Rudraprayaga, Carnaprayaga, and Nandaprayaga. Part of the religious ceremonies enjoined to the Hindoo pilgrims, must be performed in a vast subterranean cave in the middle of the fort, supported by pillars. The vulgar belief extends underground to Delhi, and say it is infested by snakes and noxious reptiles. Many of the pilgrims drown themselves annually at the junction of the Ganges and Jumna, being conducted to the middle of the river, and then sunk with pots of earth tied to their feet.\n\nThe Emperor Akbar was partial to Allahabad, and was the founder of the modern city, intending it as a strong hold to overawe the surrounding country, for which it was well adapted. It was taken, in 1765, by the British army under Sir Robert Fletcher.\n\nFollowing the course of the river, Allahabad is 820 from the sea, but the travelling distance from Calcutta is only 550 miles; from Benares, 53; from Lucknow, 127; from Agra, 296; and from Delhi, 412 miles. (Lord Valentia, Tenment, Raper, Remel, &c.)\n\nAllambrady, (Alambadi).\u2014A town in the province of Coimbetoor, 74 miles E. S. E. from Scringapatam. Lat. 12\u00b0. 8'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 55'. E.\n\nAllamparva, (Alamparee).\u2014A small fort on the sea coast of the Carnatic, 67 miles S. by W. from Madras. Lat. 12\u00b0. 10'. N. Long. 80\u00b0. 7'. E.\n\nWithin this fortress are several wells of good water, which is not to be found on all parts of the coast so near the sea. It was given to M. Duplex by Muzaffar Jung in 1750, and taken from the French by Col. Coote in 1760.\n\nAllygunge, (Aliguny).\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Purneah, 40 miles N. N. E. from the town of Purneah. Lat. 26\u00b0. 16'. N. Long. 87\u00b0. 38'. E.\n\nAlmora.\u2014A district in northern Hindostan, situated between the 29th and 30th degrees of north latitude, and separated from the Bareily districts by the Kenaon hills. The face of the country, like the rest of northern Hindostan, is a succession of mountains, covered with impervious forests of tall trees and thick jungle, and divided by abrupt valleys, in which are scattered the scanty population of the country. This district is properly a subdivision of the larger one of Kenaon; the town of Almora being the capital, and the whole tributary to the Goorkhali Rajah of Nepaul.\n\nThe tree producing a fat-like substance, known to the natives of Hindostan by the name of Phulwarah, is found among the Almora hills. The tree is scarce, grows on a strong soil on the declivities of the southern aspect of the hills below Almora, generally attaining the height, when full grown, of 50 feet, with a circumference of six. The fat is extracted from the kernels.\n\nAt Bagharghaunt, in this district, the river Causila is about 30 yards broad; and there being neither bridge nor ford, it is crossed by means of large gourds collected from the neighbouring villages. Three or four of these are fastened by a string, and tied round the waist of a man who serves for a guide. A string of the same kind is attached to the passenger to prevent his sinking, but no personal exertions are required on his part, as he has merely to grasp the bandage of his guide, who, being an expert swimmer, conveys him across to the opposite shore. The baggage is transported across on men's heads, the number of gourds being proportioned to the weight of the package.\n\nIn the Institutes of Menu, it is said, that all the Khasyas, or inhabitants of the snowy mountains, have lost their cast. If so, they must have recovered it, for there are numerous families of Brahmans in these countries, particularly Almora or Comanh, who are much respected at Benares;\nthe inhabitants of that city not considering them as having lost caste, although the bulk of them be Khasyas. (Raper, Roxburgh, Wilford, &c.)\n\nAlmora.\u2014A town in northern Hindostan, situated in the district of Almora, of which it is the capital, as well as of Kumaon. Lat. 29\u00b0. 35'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 40'. E.\n\nThis town is built on the top of a large ridge of mountains, the houses being much scattered, and extending down the slope on each side. It is said to be more extensive and populous than Serinagar, and a place of greater traffic, but it has not yet been entered by any European, although so near to the frontiers of Bengal. The inhabitants are chiefly foreigners, or the descendants of emigrants from the low lands; and the town is tributary to the Ghurkha Rajah of Nepaul, who keeps a garrison stationed here. (Raper, &c.)\n\nAloor.\u2014See Alvar.\n\nAloor.\u2014A town in the northern Carnatic, 114 miles N. from Madras. Lat. 14\u00b0. 40'. N. Long. 80\u00b0. 3'. E.\n\nAlpoor, (Alipoor).\u2014A town in the nizam's dominions, in the province of Bejapoor, 100 miles W. S. W. from Hyderabad. Lat. 16\u00b0. 40'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 20'. E.\n\nAlundy, (Alandel).\u2014A village in the province of Bejapoor, situated about nine miles to the east of Poonah. This place is famous for an Avantura, or inferior incarnation of Vishnu, under the name of Nanishwer, stated by some Brahmins to have happened 1200, and by others only 6 or 700 years ago. Although so near to Poonah, this village belongs to Dowlet Row Sindia, and during the late war was occupied by a detachment of British troops. (Moor, &c.)\n\nAlunkar, (Alaneer).\u2014A district in the northern portion of Afghanistan, situated about the 35th degree of north latitude. It borders on Calfristan to the north, but in other respects its limits, like those of the other Afghan districts in that quarter, are quite undetermined. In 1582, Abul Fazel describes it as subject to the Emperor Ameer. It is now inhabited by migratory tribes of Afghans, who, to the pastoral employment of shepherds, unite that of predatory thieves, and pay little or no obedience to the mandates of the Cabul sovereign, to whom they are nominally subject.\n\nAlvar, (Alor).\u2014A district in the N. W. quarter of the province of Agra, situated between the 27th and 29th degrees of north latitude, and in the Mahomedan histories occasionally named Mewat, and the inhabitants Mewatis. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Aloor, containing 43 Mahals; measurement 1,662,012 begahs; revenue 39,832,234 dams; Seyurghal 699,212 dams. This sircar furnishes 6514 cavalry, and 42,020 infantry.\"\n\nThe Alvar district is a hilly and woody tract of country, lying on the south-west of Delhi, and on the west of Agra, confining the low country along the western side of the Jumna to a narrow slip, and extending to the west about 130 miles, and from north to south about 90 miles. Although this tract is situated in the centre of Hindostan, and approaches as near as 25 miles of Delhi, its inhabitants have always been described as singularly savage and brutal, and robbers by profession. In this last capacity they were formerly taken into pay by the native chiefs of upper Hindostan, for the purpose of ravaging more effectually the countries which happened to be the seat of war.\n\nThis territory, although hilly, is not mountainous, and is susceptible of good cultivation\u2014a blessing it has never yet experienced. In general, there is rather a deficiency of water, which in many parts can only be procured from deep wells. The cultivators at present are Jauts, Mevattes, and Aheers, a savage tribe resembling the Jauts in their manners. The district has often changed masters, but for some time past has been possessed by Row Rajah Bu-\nchawer Singh, a Rhator Rajpoot, and known by the appellation of the Macherry Rajah, whose capital is the city of Alvar.\n\nIn November, 1803, a treaty was concluded between General Lake, on the part of the British government, and the Macherry Rajah; by the conditions of which, the friends of the one party were to be considered as standing in the same relation with the other. The British engaged not to interfere with the internal management of the rajah's country, nor demand any tribute; and the rajah undertook to assist the British government with his whole force, when their possessions were attacked.\n\nBy this treaty the British government guaranteed the security of the rajah's country against external enemies; on which account, the rajah agreed, that if any misunderstanding should arise between him and any neighbouring chieftain, the cause of dispute should be submitted in the first instance to the British government, which would endeavour to settle it amicably; if, from the obstinacy of the opposite party, amicable terms were not attainable, the rajah was authorized to demand aid from the British government; the expense to be defrayed by the rajah. (Renel, Abul Fazel, G. Thomas, Treaties, &c.)\n\nAlvar.\u2014A town in the province of Agra, district of Alvar, being the capital and strong hold of Row Rajah Butchawer Singh, the Macherry Rajah.

Long. 78\u00b0. 16'. E. This is a place of great antiquity, being mentioned as a Hindoo fortress so early as A. D. 1193, under the name of Kole.\n\nThis fortress, one of the strongest in Hindostan, was stormed, in 1803, by the army under General Lake, and taken, after a most obstinate resistance, by which the assailants suffered a very severe loss. It was then one of Dowlet Row Sindia's principal depots of military stores, the whole of which fell into the possession of the captors.\n\nIt is now the head-quarters of a district, to which a civil establishment has been appointed, for the administration of justice and collection of the revenue, subordinate to the Bareily division of the court of circuit and appeal.\n\nAlymohun.\u2014A town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Gujrat, 66 miles N.

E.\n\nAmaramwati.\u2014A small river in the province of Coimbetoor, which flows past the town and fortress of Caroor, on which account it is usually termed the Caroor River. After a short course it joins the Cavery about 10 miles below Caroor.\n\nAmeah Ghaut.\u2014A pass from the Concan province on the west coast of India, up the western Ghauts, or chain of mountains to the interior. Lat. 17\u00b0. 5'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 40'. E.\n\nThe mountains here rise to a stupendous height, and are ascended by a road which winds irregularly up, the extreme steepness rendering any other mode of ascent impracticable. The acclivities of this range of mountains are well covered with trees and underwood, which furnish shelter to tigers, and other wild animals. From the summit of the pass a sublime prospect of the lower country is presented, which throughout appears hilly and mountainous, but from their very great height no towns or minute objects are discernible. Beyond the top of the pass are hills still higher, from which the sea is visible to the westward, but to the eastward a continuation of still higher hills appears. (Moor, &c.)\nAMBAHLAH, (Ambalaya).\u2014A town in the province of Delhi, 126 miles N. by W. from the city of Delhi, and belonging to Seik chiefs. Lat. 30\u00b0. 21'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 17'. E.\n\nThis is a walled town, with a large citadel. The former is extensive and populous. The houses are mostly built of burnt bricks, but the streets are so narrow as scarcely to allow room for an elephant to pass. In 1808 all the country between Ambahlah and Mulara was subject to Dea Cour, and Roop Cour, the widows of Goor Buksh Singh, and Lal Singh the deceased Zemindars of those districts. They could bring into the field between 7 and 8000 fighting men, cavalry and infantry. (11th Reg., &c.)\n\nAMBER, (or Amber).\u2014A town in the province of Ajmeer, district of Jyenagur, or Jeypoor, of which it was formerly the capital, until Mirza Rajah Jeysing, in the reign of Aurengzebe, built a new city named Jeypoor, since when the rajahship has taken that name also. Lat. 26\u00b0. 58'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 53'. E.\n\nThe state of Amber, now Jyenagur, or Jeypoor, is said to have existed for the space of 1100 years. Jeysingh, or Jayasinha, succeeded to the inheritance of the ancient Rajahs of Amber, in the year of Vieramaditya 1750, corresponding to A.D. 1693. His mind was early stored with the knowledge contained in the Hindoo writings, but he appears peculiarly to have attached himself to the mathematical sciences, and his reputation was so great, that he was chosen by the Emperor Mahommmed Shah to reform the calendar. He finished his tables in the year 1728. (Hunter, Franklin, &c.)\n\nAMBLOO.\u2014A small island in the eastern seas, about 15 miles in circumference, situated at the south-east extremity of Booro. Lat. 3\u00b0. 55'. S. Long. 127\u00b0. E.\n\nThis island is but thinly inhabited, being much infested by the depredations of the mop-headed Papuas from New Guinea, who, in the year 1765, plundered it, and carried off many of the inhabitants. Very fine shells are found on the shores of this island. (Starovinus, Bougainville, &c.)\n\nAMBOOR.\u2014A town in the Arcot district, 108 miles W. S. W. from Madras. Lat. 12\u00b0. 51'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 50'. E.\n\nThe Amboor district is comprised within a range of surrounding hills of a moderate height; the River Palar declining from its apparent southerly direction, enters this district about three miles from the eastward, and washes the Amboor pettah, distant three miles to the southward of the fort. The skirts of the hills are covered with palmyra and date trees, from the produce of which a considerable quantity of coarse sugar is made. This tract is fertilized by numerous rills of water, conducted from the river along the margin of the heights, as a supply to the rice fields, the tobacco, cocoa nut, and mango plantations. In the hot season, in the low country, the thermometer, under the cover of a tent, rises to 100\u00b0, and exposed to the rays of the sun to 120\u00b0.\n\nThe village of Amboor is neat and regularly built, its inhabitants are industrious, and make a considerable quantity of castor oil, which they export.\n\nOn the left side of it is a lofty isolated mountain, on which formerly stood a fort, almost impregnable by nature. The upper works have been destroyed since it came into the possession of the British, and the lower is a place of confinement for malefactors. The plain on the top is sufficiently large to have rendered its cultivation an object of importance, and on it are two tanks, near to where the barracks formerly stood. The view from it is noble and extensive, and the air cool in comparison with what it is below.\n\nThis district suffered greatly during Hyder's different invasions of what we call the Carnatic, from which it has not yet altogether recovered. Near Amboor the Barranahal ends, and the territories of Arcot com-\nAmboyna, (Ambun).\u2014An island in the eastern seas, lying off the S.W. coast of the island of Ceram. Lat. 3\u00b0. 40'. S. Long. 128\u00b0. 15'. E. In length it may be estimated at 32 miles, by 10 the average breadth. The name is a Malay word, signifying dew.\n\nOn the S.W. it is indented by a deep bay, by which it is divided into two limbs, or peninsulas, connected together by a very narrow isthmus. Both of these are mountainous, and almost overgrown with trees and underwood; between which, at intervals, some clove trees are planted and cultivated by the Amboynese. The soil is mostly a reddish clay; but in the valleys, where there are no rocks, it is darker coloured, and mixed with sand. Many of the hills yield brimstone, with which their surface is incrusted.\n\nAmboyna produces all the common tropical fruits and vegetables, and likewise the cajeput tree, from the leaves of which the hot and strong oil, called cajeput oil, is distilled. The clove bark tree, or Laurus sassafras, and the teak tree, are also found here, but the latter in small quantities, timber for building being imported from Java. Although the quantity is not great, the varieties of woods are infinite. Valentyn enumerates different species of the ebony tree, the iron tree, the casuarina, the wild clove tree, the samanu tree, which is a bastard sort of teak, and the nani tree, which the Chinese use for anchors and rudders. He also mentions that, in 1682, Rumphins, (the author of the Hortus Amboinensis) had a cabinet inlaid with 400 choice and handsome woods, all produced in the island, which he presented to Cosmo, the third Duke of Tuscany.\n\nThe clove tree resembles a large pear tree, from 20 to 40 feet high. At nine years of age it yields cloves, and continues bearing to about 100 years; October and November being the usual period of the clove crop, when from two to three pounds are generally procured from each tree. Every Amboynese plants a clove tree on the birth of a child, in order by a rough calculation to know its age, and these the Dutch dare not extirpate, for fear of an insurrection: the nutmeg trees, however, they managed to destroy about 30 years ago, considering the produce of Banda sufficient. During the Dutch possession, two years crop of cloves furnished the cargoes of three ships, and the total annual produce exceeded 650,000 lbs.\n\nIndigo, of a superior quality, is produced in Amboyna, but not in large quantities. The sago tree is found in abundance, and is a principal article of food used by the inhabitants; an ordinary tree, from its twelfth to the twentieth year, when cut down, will yield 350 lbs of sago. They are seven years of arriving at full growth, and last about 30 years.\n\nThe woods of Amboyna swarm with deer and wild hogs, the flesh of which is used by the native fresh, salted, and dried. The domestic animals are buffaloes, cows, horses, sheep, goats, and hogs. The last only are natives of the country, the others having been brought hither by the Portuguese and Dutch from Java, Celebes, and the south western isles. There are no beasts of prey on the island, but plenty of snakes.\n\nThe monsoons are exactly the contrary here to what they are along the islands of Java, Bornco, Bali, Lumbhook, and Sumbhaba. When at these islands the fine season prevails, it is the reverse at Amboyna, Ceram, Banda, the east coast of Celebes, and the adjacent seas. The difference appears to commence to the eastward of the Straits of Salayr, which are about longitude 120\u00b0. 30'. E. The currents are not regular at Amboyna, neither has the moon any constant or equal influence on the tides; high and low water sometimes occur once, and sometimes\ntwice, in 24 hours, the rise being from six to nine feet.\n\nFort Victoria is situated on the south-east side of the island, and is an irregular hexagon, with a ditch and covered way on the land side, and a horn-work towards the sea; but it is commanded by two heights within 700 and 1200 yards distance, the difficulty of anchoring in the bay constituting the chief strength of the island.\n\nThe town of Amboyna is clean, neatly and regularly built, and is well supplied with water. The west end of the town is inhabited by Chinese, and the south end by Europeans, near to which is the tomb of Rumphius. On account of the frequency of earthquakes, the height of the houses seldom exceeds one story. The medium heat is from $80^\\circ$ to $89^\\circ$ of Fahrenheit, and the severest cold about $72^\\circ$.\n\nThe inhabitants of Amboyna are, the Aborigines, or Horatoras, the Amboynese, the Europeans, and the Chinese; but of the first there are now very few remaining. The Amboynese were converted to the Mahommedan religion about A.D. 1515; the Portuguese afterwards converted a number of them to the Roman Catholic religion, and the Dutch to the Calvinistic religion, but the greater proportion are still Mahommedans. The principal Amboynese Christians still bear Portuguese names, but their number is not great. The Chinese on Amboyna are not so numerous in proportion as on the other islands, yet they are the only strangers the Dutch permitted to settle here. They keep shops, sell provisions, and intermarry with each other.\n\nWhen Francis Xavier, the celebrated Jesuit missionary was at Amboyna, in 1546, he observed the inhabitants then beginning to learn to write from the Arabians. The inhabitants at present speak the Malay language. This island was discovered by the Portuguese about A.D. 1515, but was not taken possession of until 1564, and was conquered from them by the Dutch about 1607. In 1615, the English East India Company's agents obtained possession of Cambello Castle, through the friendship of the natives, but were soon compelled to abandon it, being attacked by the Dutch with a superior force. They still, however, continued to have a factory on Amboyan until February, 1622, when the Dutch governor, Herman Van Speult, seized and tortured all the individuals belonging to the English factory, and afterwards executed them. They consisted of Captain Towerson, nine English factors, nine Japanese (probably Javanese), and one Portuguese sailor. Yet was this most atrocious villain promoted by the Dutch East India Company, in whose service he died during an expedition up the Red Sea.\n\nUnder the subsequent Dutch government, the province of Amboyna comprehended 11 islands, viz. Amboyna, Ceram, Bouro, Ambloo, Manipa, Kelang, Bona, Ceram Laut, Noussa Laut, Uonimoa or Sapparooa, and Oma or Harocha. They discouraged the cultivation of rice, in order to render Amboyna more dependent on Java, the original inhabitants subsisting on fish and sago. In 1777 the Dutch public establishment here consisted of 52 persons in civil employments, three clergymen, 28 surgeons, 46 artillerymen, 174 seamen and marines, 657 soldiers, and 111 mechanics; in all 1071 persons, denominated Europeans. In 1779 the charges of Amboyna were \u00a3201,082, and the whole revenues, including the profit on the sale of goods, amounted to no more than \u00a348,747, leaving a balance against the Dutch East India Company of \u00a3152,335, or about \u00a313,350l. sterling annually.\n\nThe Dutch here followed the same intemperate and destructive mode of life as at Batavia. Stavorinus, their countryman, says, that 10 or 12 drams of arrack, or Geneva, was no uncommon whet at Amboyna.\nDutch Company's servants usually married women born in the country, who being accustomed to the Malay tongue from their infancy, spoke Dutch with extreme difficulty and reluctance, which, conjoined with the natural taciturnity of the men, reduced the conversation to nearly a simple negative and affirmative.\n\nUnder the Dutch government this island continued until 1796, when it was captured by the British, and 515,940 lbs. of cloves found in the warehouses. At this period it was found to contain 45,252 inhabitants, of whom 17,813 were Protestants, and the rest Mahommedans, except a few Chinese and slaves. It was restored to the Dutch at the peace of Amiens, and was again recaptured in February, 1810, by a handful of men, after a most feeble resistance.\n\nIn 1810-11 the imports to Bengal from Amboyna were cordage and cables, 6000 Rs. timber and planks, 465 Rs.\u2014Total 6465 rupees. The exports from Bengato Amboyna consisted of piece goods, 125,437; opium, 99,475; Madeira wine, 11,060, and some other smaller articles of consumption; the total amounting to 2,73,191 sicca rupees. Goods were also received from Madras and other parts of British India, but of which we have not any detail. (Stavorinus and Notes, Labillardiere, 2 Reg.

E.\n\nThis place was formerly an independent principality, held by the Jada Rapoots; but, standing on the confines of Joudpoor and Siude, it soon became an object of contention between these two states, and, at present, acknowledges the authority of the Rajah of Joudpoor. The surrounding country is so arid and sterile, that Amerkote does not derive sufficient land revenue to support a small local military corps, although situated in the vicinity of many martial and predatory tribes. Taxes on travellers and merchandize are the only sources from which any revenue is procured, there being scarcely any agriculture. In the neighbourhood of this place stands the principal fortress belonging to Meer Gholauin Ali, the chief ameer of Sinde, in which his treasures are supposed to be deposited. It is situated on a hill in the desert, no water being found within four stages of it; but the fortress contains excellent wells.\n\nThe Emperor Humayoon, after his expulsion from Hindostan by Shere Shah the Patan, in his extreme distress fled to the Rajah of Amerkote, in the desert, and was hospitably received. Here the Emperor Acher was born, A.D. 1541. (Macmurdo, Kenneir, Maurice, MS. &c.)\n\nAMMERPOOR, (Amarapura).\u2014A town in northern Hindostan, district of Moewanpoor, situated on the north-west side of the Bagmutty river, 10 miles E. from the town of Moewanpoor. Lat. 27\u00b0 31'. N. Long. 82\u00b0 26'. With the rest of the district it is subject to the Gockhali Rajah of Nepaul.\n\nAMORA.\u2014A town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Kandesh, situated on the north side of the Tuptee, 15 miles S.W. from Boorhampoor. Lat. 31\u00b0 34'. N. Long. 76\u00b0 11'. E.\n\nAMRAN.\u2014A town and fortress, with a district adjacent, situated in the Gujrat peninsula. Lat. 22\u00b0 35'. N. Long. 70\u00b0 35'. E.\n\nThe fort here is small and square, with angular bastions, and a square tower in each curtain. The town\nis distinct from the fort, and situated on a rising ground to the northward, about the distance of a musket shot. The adjacent fields are much covered with a species of wild balm or mint, and the sensitive plant is perceived growing spontaneously. The soil is a mixture of light sand and clay, and is reckoned very productive.\n\nThe district of Amran originally belonged to the family of Noanagur, but was ceded by Jam, the chieftain of that place, to the family of Khowas, along with the two neighbouring districts of Balmaba and Juria. Meeru Khowas, the founder of the family, was the slave of a neighbouring chieftain, and afterwards became the minister of the Jam of Noanagur. When the father of the present rajah died, he confined the young heir, and received the above three districts as the price of his liberty.\n\nAmran is at present subject to Hirjee Khowas, and has 10 or 15 villages subject to it, which yield a revenue of about 15,000 rupees. Near to one of them is a monument erected to commemorate a tragic event, committed in 1807 by a Rajhur Brahmin. To deter his superior, Hirjee Khowas, from depriving him of some lands in the vicinity, he led his mother to the gate of Amran, and there cut off her head, which had the desired effect. Instances of this sort are frequent in Gujrat; and, on most occasions, the victim, whether male or female, not only consents to, but glories in, the death inflicted. The person who is, in many cases, the innocent cause of the catastrophe, is considered by the Brahminical code as damned for ever; while the wretch who, for his own profit, perpetrates the murder, is not only held innocent by his fellow citizens, but suffers no pang either of heart or conscience. (Mr. Murdo, &c.)\n\nAMRETSIR, (Amrita Saras, the Fountain of Nectar).\u2014A town in the province of Lahore, 40 miles S. E. from the city of Lahore, and the capital of the Seik nation. Lat. 31\u00b0. 34'. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 25'. E.\n\nThis is an open town about eight miles in circumference. The streets are narrow; the houses, in general, good, being lofty and built of burned bricks, but the apartments are confined. Amreetsir is the grand emporium of trade for the shawls and saffron of Cashmere, and a variety of other commodities from the Deccan and eastern part of India. The rajah levies an excise on all the merchandise sold in the town according to its value. The manufactures of the place are only a few coarse cloths and inferior silks. From being the resort of many rich merchants, and the residence of bankers, Amreetsir is considered as a place of opulence. The Seik rajah has built a new fort, which he has named after himself, Runjeet Ghur, and he has also brought a narrow canal from the Ravee, a distance of 3\u00bd miles.\n\nAmreetsir, or the pool of immortality, from which the town takes its name, is a basin of about 135 paces square, built of burnt bricks; in the centre of which stands a temple, dedicated to Guroo Govind Singh. In this sacred place is lodged, under a silken canopy, the book of laws, written by that Guroo. There are from five to 600 akalies, or priests, belonging to this temple, who are supported by contributions.\n\nWhen Ahmed Shah Abdalli came to Amreetsir, he erased their temple twice, and killed cows, and threw them into the water to defile it. The rajah has a mint here, at which different coins are struck in the name of their greatest saint, Baba Nanoe Shah. The names of their ten saints are, Baba Nanoe Shah, Amerdass, Guroo Arjoon Shah, Guroo Tegh Bahadur, Guroo Angut, Guroo Ramdass, Guroo Hurgovind, Guroo Hurkrishna, Guroo Govind Singh.\n\nGood camels are to be purchased here at about 50 rupees each. They are brought down, with rock salt, from a mine about 80 miles north of Lahore. Strings of 600 are seen on the road, with a large lump, re-\nANDAMANS.\n\nAnambas.

N. to 13\u00b0. 40'. N. What has been considered as the great Andaman is the most northern, about 140 miles in length, and 20 in breadth. This island is, however, divided by two very narrow straits, which have a clear passage into the Bay of Bengal, and in fact divides it into three islands; the little Andaman is the most southerly, and lies within 30 leagues of the Carnicobar Island. Its length is 28 miles by 17 in breadth, but it does not afford any harbour, although tolerable anchorage is found near its shores. Situated in the full sweep of the south-west monsoon, and the clouds being obstructed by high mountains, these islands, for eight months of the year, are washed by incessant torrents. Upon the whole the climate is rather milder than in Bengal. The tides are regular, the floods setting in from the west, and rising eight feet at the springs. The variation of the needle is 2\u00b0. 30'. easterly.\n\nIn the centre of the large Andaman is a high mountain, named Saddlepeak, about 2400 feet high. There are no rivers of any considerable size. The most common trees are\n\nsembling a block of unwrought marble, slung on each side.\n\nSome Seik authorities ascribe the foundation of Amretcir to Gooroo Ram Dass, (who died A.D. 1581,) which is not correct, as it was a very ancient town, known formerly under the name of Chak. Gooroo Ram Dass added much to its population, and built the famous reservoir or tank, named Amretcir, which, in the course of time, became the name of the town, it having been for some time called Rundasspoor.

Although the government is Malayian, and the ministers of the sultan are termed Mantri, (a little borrowed from the Hindoos) the greatest part of the district is inhabited by the original country people. This state became independent about 1695, in consequence of a revolution in the government of Indrapoor.

Many of the trees afford timbers and planks fit for the construction of ships, and others might answer for masts.\n\nThe birds seen in the woods are pigeons, crows, parroquets, king fishers, curlews, fish hawks, fowls. There are a great variety of fish, such as mullet, soles, pomfret, rock fish, skate, gunnas, sardinas, roeballs, sable, shad, aloose, cockup, grobers, seerfish, prawns, shrimps, cray fish, a species of whale, and sharks of an enormous size. During the prevalence of the north-east monsoon, fish are caught in great abundance, but in the tempestuous season they are procured with difficulty. There are many sorts of shell fish, and in some places oysters of an excellent quality. A few diminutive swine are found on the skirts of the forest; but these are very scarce, and probably the progeny of a stock left by former navigators. Although the ordinary food of the Andamaners be fish, they eat likewise lizards, guanas, rats, and snakes. Within the caverns and recesses is found the edible bird nests, so highly prized by the Chinese, and the shores abound with a variety of beautiful shells, gorgonias, madreporas, murex, and cowries.\n\nThe vegetable productions are very few, the fruit of the mangrove being the principal. As the natives possess no pot or vessel, that can bear the action of fire, they cannot derive much advantage from such esculents as the forests may contain; and unhappily for the Andamaners, the cecoa nut, which thrives so well at the Nicobar Islands, close in their vicinity, is not to be found here.\n\nThe first settlement of the English was made in the year 1791, near the southern extremity of the island, which was afterwards removed, in 1793, to Port Cornwallis. A more picturesque or romantic view can scarcely be imagined, than that which Chatham Island and Cornwallis Harbour present: being land-locked on all sides, nothing is to be seen but an extensive sheet of water, resembling a vast lake, interspersed with small islands, and surrounded by lofty mountains covered with trees. The original object of the undertaking was to procure a commodious harbour on the east side of the bay, to receive and shelter ships of war during the continuance of the north-east monsoon. It was also intended as a place of reception for convicts sentenced to transportation from Bengal; but the settlement proving extremely unhealthy, it has been abandoned, and the convicts are now sent to Prince of Wales Island.\n\nThe Andamaners, together with the Nicobars and lesser islands, were included by Ptolemy in the general appellation of Insulae bonae Fortune, and supposed to be inhabited by a race of Anthropophagi, a description which the barbarity of the modern Andamaners perhaps justifies, as far as refers to them, for the inhabitants of the Nicobars are a very different race.\n\nThe population of the great Andaman, and all its dependencies, does not exceed 2000, or 2500 souls: these are dispersed, in small societies, along the coast, or on the lesser islands within the harbour, never penetrating deeper into the interior than the skirts of the forest. Their sole occupation seems to be that of climbing rocks, or roving along the margin of the sea in quest of a precarious meal of fish, which, during the tempestuous season, they often seek in vain.\n\nIt is an object of much curiosity to discover the origin of a race of people so widely differing, not only from all the inhabitants of the neighbouring continent, but also from those of the Nicobar Islands, which are so near: hitherto, however, the inquiries of travellers have produced no satisfactory conclusion. In stature the An-\ndamagers seldom exceed five feet; their limbs are disproportionately slender; their bellies protuberant, with high shoulders and large heads; and they appear to be a degenerate race of negroes, with woolly hair, flat noses, and thick lips: their eyes are small and red, their skin of a deep sooty black, while their countenances exhibit the extreme of wretchedness, a horrid mixture of famine and ferocity. They go quite naked, and are insensible to any shame from exposure.\n\nThe few implements they use are of the rudest texture. Their principal weapon is a bow, from four to five feet long; the string made of the fibres of a tree, or a slip of bamboo, with arrows of reed, headed with fish bone, or wood hardened in the fire. Besides this, they carry a spear of heavy wood, sharp pointed, and a shield made of bark. They shoot and spear fish with great dexterity, and are said also to use a small hand net, made of the filaments of bark. Having kindled a fire, they throw the fish on the coals, and devour it half broiled.\n\nTheir habitations display little more ingenuity than the dens of wild beasts. Four sticks fixed in the ground are bound at the top, and fastened transversely by others, to which branches of trees are suspended; an opening just large enough to admit of entrance is left on one side, and their bed is composed of leaves. Being much incommodeed by insects, their first occupation of a morning is, to plaster their bodies all over with mud, which hardening in the sun, forms an impenetrable armour. Their woolly heads they paint with red ochre and water, and when thus completely dressed, a more hideous appearance is not to be found in the human form. Their salutation is performed by lifting up one leg, and smacking with their hand the lower part of the thigh.\n\nTheir canoes are hollowed out of the trunks of trees, by fire and instruments of stone, having no iron in use among them but such as they accidentally procure from Europeans, or from vessels wrecked on their coast. The men are cunning and revengeful, and have a great hatred to strangers: they have never made any attempt to cultivate the land, but subsist on what they can pick up or kill.\n\nThe language of the Andamaners has not been discovered to possess the slightest affinity to any that is spoken in India, or among the islands.\n\nThey appear to express an adoration to the sun, the moon, and to imaginary beings, the genii of the woods, waters, and mountains. In storms they apprehend the influence of a malignant being, and deprecate his wrath by chanting wild choruses. Of a future it is not known they have any idea, which possibly arises from our imperfect means of discovering their opinion. (Symes, Col. Colebrooke, &c.)\n\nAndapoorghur, (Antapurgar).\u2014A town in the province of Orissa, district of Kunjeur, 60 miles west from Balasore. Lat. 21\u00b0. 33'. N. Long. 86\u00b0. 20'. E.

E. from Palieaud-cherry. Lat. 10\u00b0. 41'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 3'. This town contains 400 houses, and is situated on the west side of\nthe River Alima. It is a common thoroughfare between Malabar and the southern part of the Arcot dominions, being placed opposite to the wide passage, that is between the southern end of the Ghauts of Karnata and the hills that run north from Cape Comorin. The Madura rajahs, formerly lords of the country, built a fort close to the river, which having fallen to ruins, the materials were removed by the Mysore rajahs, and a new fort built at some distance to the westward. The Animalaya polygars are 12 in number. The greater part of the dry field in the neighbourhood is now overgrown with woods, the country having been much devastated by the Nairs. The exclusive privilege of collecting drugs in the hills south from Animalaya is here rented to a particular person. The elephants are increasing in number, owing to their not having been hunted for some years past.\n\nThe forests are very extensive, and contain abundance of teak and other valuable timber, but unfortunately it is too remote from water carriage, to permit its exportation. (F. Buchanan, &c. &c.)\n\nAnjediva, (Adjadewipa).\u2014A small island, about one mile in circumference, and two from the shore, lying off the coast of Canara, 57 miles S. by E. from Gra. Lat. 14\u00b0. 44'. N. Long. 74\u00b0. E.\n\nIn 1662, Sir Abraham Shipman, when refused possession of Bombay by the Portuguese, landed on this island with his troops, amounting to 500 men, where they continued until March, 1664-65. During this interval they lost, by sickness, their commander, and when removed to Bombay, the survivors of the whole mustered only two officers and 119 rank and file. (Bruce, &c. &c.)\n\nAnjengo, (Anjutenga).\u2014A town and small fort, the residence of a commercial agent for the Company, on the sea coast of Travancor, 70 miles N. W. from Cape Comorin. Lat. 8\u00b0. 39'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 51'. E.\n\nAt a short distance from this place lies Attinga, the residence of the Queen of Travancor, a title always given to the king's oldest sister. The interior districts of the country are inhabited by Hindoos; whereas on the sea coast, the greater part of the inhabitants are Christians and Mahomedans. So far back as 1694, the English East India Company obtained permission, from the Queen of Attinga, to settle and fortify Ajungo, from whence they expected to procure a large quantity of pepper and cardamonis, the staple produce of Travancor. The best coir cables on the Malabar coast are made here, and at Cochin, of the fibres of the Laccadive cocoanut. The exports are pepper, coarse piece goods, coir, and some drugs; the imports are of very small amount. (Fra Paolo, Bruce, &c. &c.)\n\nAnjerie.\u2014A considerable village half way up the Straits of Sunda, on the Java shore, where ships may be conveniently supplied with water, and every kind of refreshment; yet, because this side of the strait is occasionally subject to calms, which may sometimes cause a delay of two or three days, few of the outward-bound China ships touch here, preferring the Sumatran shore, where only wood and water are procurable, and where numbers of seamen yearly fall a sacrifice to Malay treachery, and to the unhealthiness of the place. The Dutch maintained a small garrison here to protect the inhabitants against the Malays. At this place Colonel Catchcart is interred, who died on his way to China as ambassador, in 1785.\n\nAnnagoondy, (Anagundi).\u2014This is the Canara name for the famous city of Bijanagur. Lat. 15\u00b0. 14'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 34'. E. It is situated on the north bank of the Toombuddra, opposite to the city of Allputna, which name, as well as Annagoondy, is sometimes understood to include both cities. The name of Bijanagur is still retained by the Mahomedans.\n\nAfter the conquest of Bijanagur by the Mahomedan princes of the\nDeccan, the nominal rajahs were allowed to retain Annagoondy, and some other districts in Jaghire, for several generations. Prior to 1749, the Maharatta chiefs had imposed a tribute on them, which Hyder in 1775 increased. In 1786 Tippoo entered Annagoondy, expelled the rajah, burned his palace and all his records, and annexed the district to the government lands. In 1790, the rajah again seized the district, but was driven out by Tippoo's general, Cummer ud Deen Khan. In 1798, he again made himself master of the country, and did not submit until the British army approached. Purneah, the Dewan of Mysore, took the management of the country from him, and gave him a monthly allowance of 2000 rupees, which was reduced to 1500, when Annagoondy was made over to the nizam, and it is now continued at that rate by the British government. The present rajah is a man of mean capacity, but little removed from idiotism. (Murro, Renneel, Moor, &c.)\n\nAnontpoor, (Anantapura).\u2014A small town in the Rajah of Mysore's territories, district of Bedmore. Lat. 14\u00b0 N. Long. 75\u00b0 22' E.\n\nAnopsheher, (Anupa Sheher).\u2014A town in the province of Delhi, district of Bareily, 70 miles S. E. from Delhi, situated on the west bank of the Ganges. Lat. 28\u00b0 21'. Long. 78\u00b0 13'.\n\nOn the south, this town is defended by a large brick fort, erected chiefly against the attacks of cavalry, as it had no battery of cannon, but there are loop-holes for bows and arrows. From this citadel there is a commanding view of the whole country, and the Ganges winding through it for many miles. About the end of December this river is reduced to a very small breadth, but its stream is pure and clear. The west bank rises perpendicularly about 30 feet, and on that side the country is not overflowed; while, on the opposite side, the slope from the bank is almost imperceptible, and the fields are inundated.\n\nThe land to the eastward of Anopsheher is well cultivated, and tolerably well fenced. The strong jungle grass is plaited into webs of a sort of basket work, and these, placed on the sides of the field, protect the grain from almost every sort of cattle, except the wild hogs, which are here very numerous, as are deer and game of all sorts.\n\nThe town of Anopsheher is contained within a strong mud wall; and, though not of great extent, is thickly inhabited, the houses being a mixture of brick and mud buildings. The surrounding wall of this place is in some parts 20 and 30 feet thick. Formerly, in this part of Hindostan, when a zemindar's rent was demanded, he betook himself, with all his effects, to his fort, and then held out, until overcome by a superior military force; frequently expending much more than the sum demanded in resisting the claim.\n\nFrom hence the high mountains to the north east are seen, the distance supposed about 200 miles. They appear like snowy clouds, towering to an immense height in the skies, and the wind which blows from them excessively cold, bringing fluxes and agues.

This place was formerly inhabited by a person of the Bayda cast, named Arava, the name signifying the Seat of Arava. It afterwards became subject to Madura, and then to Mysore, the curtur or sovereign of which built near the town a neat fort, and gave it the name of Vijaya-Mangalam, by the Mahommiedans pronounced Bija-mangle. About the end of Hyder's reign, an English army took the fort, at which time the town was destroyed. It now contains above 300 houses, and is fast recovering. The inhabitants speak mostly the Tamil language. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nARACOTE.\u2014A few days journey to the west of Hyderabad, in the province of Sinde; there is a pagoda dedicated to the Goddess Bhavani, at a place named Aracote. It is described as being situated in the centre of seven ranges of hills, which the multitude of pilgrims who resort to it consider as too sacred for human steps, and the resort of aerial beings. (Maxfield, &c.)\n\nARAWUL.\u2014A town in the Maharratta territories, in the province of Khandesh, 55 miles W. by S. from Boorhanpoor. Lat. 21\u00b0. 9'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 28'. E.\n\nARCOT, (Northern Division).\u2014A collectorship in the Carnatic under the Madras Presidency, which also includes Sativaid, Pulicat, Coongoody in the Barramahal, part of the Balaghat, and of the western polams, or zemindaries.\n\nBoth divisions were transferred to the British government by the Nabob of the Carnatic in 1801.\n\nARCOT, (Southern Division).\u2014A collectorship in the Carnatic, under the Madras Presidency, which includes Cuddalore and Pondicherry.\n\nIn 1806, this district was in a very miserable state, but it has since progressively improved. At that period the revenue was collected with difficulty; the villages in part deserted, and some wholly; the remaining inhabitants practising every artifice to avoid paying their rents, and to conceal the public revenue, the general appearance of the country and villages indicating extreme misery. This condition originated partly from the land being over assessed, and partly from the rapacious exactions of the native officers, who collected the revenues during the nabob's administration.\n\nThe principal trading ports in this district are Cuddalore, Pondicherry, and Portonovo. The total value of the imports, from the 1st of May, 1811, to the 30th of April, 1812, was 4,56,879 Arcot rupees, of which 2,40,791 rupees was from places beyond the territories of the Madras government, viz.\n\n| From Calcutta | - - - | 26,374 |\n| Ceylon | - - - | 32,835 |\n| Eastward | - - - | 1,20,580 |\n| Prince of Wales Island | - - - | 32,213 |\n| Travancor | - - - | 1,352 |\n| Various places | - - - | 27,437 |\n\nArcot rupees 2,40,791\n\nThe total value of the exports during the above period was 9,74,987 Arcot rupees, of which 5,25,418 rupees was to places beyond the territories of the Madras government, viz.\nTo Calcutta - - - - - 5,848\nCeylon - - - - - 6,548\nEastward - - - - - 216,093\nIsles of France - - - 95,664\nPrince of Wales Island 1,88,111\nVarious places - - - 13,154\n\nArcot rupees 5,25,418\n\nExcepting small importations of rice and wheat from Bengal, the whole trade of Pondicherry, in the above period, consisted of arrack, pepper, palmirahs, drawn from Ceylon, Travancor, and Prince of Wales Island. Large supplies of piece goods were exported to the Isle of France, and a small quantity of rum to Ceylon.\n\nTo Cuddalore the import trade from the eastward was very considerable, and consisted of betel nut, pepper, and elephants' teeth. The exports consisted mostly of piece goods to Prince of Wales Island.\n\nPortonovo, in like manner, furnished large supplies of piece goods for the eastern market, and in return imported betel nut, pepper, benjamin, camphor, sugar, and elephants' teeth; besides which, rice from Bengal, and tobacco from Ceylon, in small quantities, were received. (Ravenshaw, 5th Report; Report on External Commerce, &c.)\n\n**Arcot, (Arrucat).\u2014A town in the Carnatic, situated on the south side of the River Palar. Lat. 12\u00b0. 52'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 29'. E.**\n\nThe bed of the River Palar is at this place half a mile wide, but in the dry season does not contain a stream sufficient to turn a mill. The hills in the neighbourhood are extremely barren. They are of granite, and appear to be undergoing a rapid decay. In many parts of the vallies, formed by these hills, chunaum, or limestone nodules is found, which in Bengal is called Conkar. The country from hence to Vellore is but thinly peopled, and a considerable portion of the land still waste.\n\nArcot is the nominal capital of the Carnatic below the Ghauts, as the nabob's dominions are named by the Mahomedans and English. The town is chiefly inhabited by Mahomedans, who speak the Deecany dialect, which we name Hindostani. The fort is large, but not in good repair. The town surrounds the glacis on all sides, and is extensive; the houses also are as good as near to Madras. There is a manufacture of coarse cotton cloths here, but they are dearer than in Bengal.\n\nArcot is said to be noticed by Ptolemy as the capital of the Sora, or Soranmundalum, from whence corruptly Coromandel; but the present town is of modern date. After the Mogul armies captured Gingee, they found it so extremely unhealthy, that they were obliged to canton on the plains of Arcot, which led to the establishment of that capital of the lower Carnatic in 1716.\n\nAnwar un Deen, the Nabob of Arcot, was killed in battle, A.D. 1749, after which this place was taken by Chundasahcb, the French candidate. In 1751, it was retaken by Captain Clive, with 200 Europeans and 300 sepoys. The garrison being panic-struck, made no resistance, although they amounted to 1100 men. He was immediately besieged by the French and their allies; but, notwithstanding his garrison consisted of only 120 Europeans and 200 sepoys fit for service, he resisted 50 days under every disadvantage, and at last compelled the enemy to raise the siege. It afterwards fell into the possession of the French allies; but was finally taken in February, 1760, by Colonel Coote, after the battle of Wande-wash.\n\nArcot surrendered to Hyder the 3d of November, 1780; and, with its vicinity, suffered greatly by his different invasions, and during the misgovernment of the nabob's revenue officers, but they are now fast recovering.\n\nTravelling distance from Madras, 73 miles; from Serinapatanam, 217; from Calcutta, 1070; and from Delhi, 1277 miles.

On the plains, near this place, a battle was fought on the 28th November, 1803, betwixt the British army, under General Wellesley, and that of the Rajah of Berar, in which the latter was completely defeated, with very little loss on the part of the British. The Maharattas lost 38 pieces of cannon, all their ammunition, elephants, and baggage, and sustained very great slaughter during their flight. After this battle, and the subsequent capture of Gwalghur, the Berar Rajah made peace on the terms proposed by General Wellesley. The village now forms part of the nizam's dominions.\n\nAriancoopan.\u2014A small town on the sea-coast of the Carnatic, near Pondicherry. Lat. 11\u00b0. 54'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 56'. E.

A flag staff and field piece are attached to the party, to make signals to the boats, and to give notice of their going out and returning. Arippo is the only place in this neighbourhood where good water can be procured. There is a chapel here for persons of the Roman Catholic persuasion, who consist chiefly of Parawas and Malabars, resorting to this place during the season of the fishery.

This was the first English establishment in the Carnatic, and until the acquisition of Madras. In the year 1625, the principal East India Company's agents having obtained a piece of ground from the naik, or chief of the district, they erected a factory at this place. In 1628 it is described as being defended by 12 pieces of cannon mounted round the factory, with a guard of 23 factors and soldiers.

It is surrounded by a high stone wall, and has a little castle. The milk bush fences, common in the southern part of the peninsula, are not to be seen here, dry stone walls round the fields being substituted. (M'Murdo, &c.)\n\nAROO.\u2014A large island in the Eastern Seas to the south of Papua, the centre of which lies nearly in the 135th degree of east longitude, and the 6th of south latitude. In length it may be estimated at 140 miles, by 35 miles the average breadth. This island has, as yet, been but very imperfectly explored; and little is known with respect to either the country, or the inhabitants. The Chinese merchants, settled at Banda, carry on a traffic with this island, from whence they receive pearls, bird nests, tortoise shells, and slaves.\n\nThis island is supposed to be one of the breeding places of the birds of paradise, of which seven species are described by Valentyn. They are caught by the inhabitants of the Papuan Isles, who draw their entrails, and fumigate them, having first cut their legs off, which gave rise to the fabulous report that this bird had no legs, but existed constantly on the wing in the air. The arrangement of their plumage is such as greatly to facilitate their continuing long without touching the earth; but when they do, they reascend with great difficulty, and a particular species is said to be again unable to rise. The largest are about two and a half feet in length.\n\nAn aromatic, resembling cinnamon in its flavour, and much used among the eastern islands, and named the Missoy bark, is principally procured here and at Papua. It is seldom carried to Europe.\n\nAROUL.\u2014A small town in the province of Agra, district of Kanoge, 13 miles S. S. E. from Kanoge. Lat. 26\u00b0. 56'. N. Long. 80\u00b0.

A range of lofty mountains, named Anoupectoumienou, bound it to the east; and towards the south approach so near to the sea, that though its length may be estimated at 500 miles, in many places the breadth in land does not exceed 10 miles, and nowhere more than 100.\n\nFrom the side of Chittagong, entrance into Arracan must be effected by a march along the sea beach, interrupted by several channels, which chiefly owe their waters to the action of the tide. From the quarter of Basseeen and Negrais, Arracan can only be invaded by water, owing to the numerous rivers that intersect the country adjacent to the sea. Cheduba, Ramree, Arracan, and Sandowy, form four distinct provinces, and comprehend the whole of the Arracan territory.\n\nThe sea coast of Arracan is studded with islands, of different sizes, and numerous clusters of rocks, that lie at a small distance from the shore, many of which exhibit a striking resemblance to the forms of different animals. Behind these islands the sea coast is agreeably diversified with hill and dale, the former covered with trees.\n\nThe natives of Arracan Proper call their country Yokein, the Hindoos of Bengal Rossaun. The latter, who have settled in great numbers in Arracan, are denominated by the original inhabitants Kulaw Yokein, or unnaturalized Arracaners. The Mo-\nguls know this country by the name of Reckan. Mogo is a term of religious import and high sanctity, applied to the priesthood and king, whence the inhabitants are often called by Europeans Mughs. The Mahomedans, who have been long settled in Arracan, call themselves Rooinga, or natives of Arracan.\n\nIn 1582 Abul Fazel describes this country as follows:\n\n\"To the south-east is a large country named Arkung, to which the Bunder, or Port of Chittagong, properly belongs. Here are plenty of elephants, but great scarcity of horses.\"\n\nRespecting the interior of this country very little is known, but a considerable intercourse subsists betwixt the maritime districts and the Bengal provinces. From Arracan there are 40 or 50 boats of 500 maunds each (80 lbs) equipped annually by merchants who travel across the country from Umerapoor, Cheghein, and other cities in the dominions of Ava, for the Bengal trade. Each boat may be valued at 4000 rupees capital, principally in silver bullion. One half of these boats return with red betel nut, and this trade is so systematically established, that they even farm the betel nut plantations about Luckipore. The principal exports from Arracan, besides bullion, are salt, bees wax, elephants teeth, and rice, the latter of which is produced in great abundance, and the contiguous islands are uncommonly fruitful. Many Birman boats, also, navigating during the north-west monsoon, proceed from Rassein, Rangoon, and Martaban, along the Arracan coast, and make an annual voyage to Chittagong, Dacca, and Calcutta, where they dispose of their produce, and return with Indian and European commodities. Prior to 1764 the Dutch used to purchase rice and slaves here.\n\nThe Rukhing is the original language of the inhabitants of Arracan, who adhere to the tenets of Buddha, and formed, in ancient times, a part of the empire of Magadha, from which they seem to have derived the name of Mug, or Mangua, by which they are generally distinguished by the inhabitants of Bengal. This dialect (the Rukhing) is the first of that singular class of Indo Chinese languages, which may be properly termed monosyllabic, from the mass of their radical words consisting of monosyllables, like the spoken dialects of China.\n\nUntil their last conquest by the Birmans, the tribes of Arracan seem for a long period to have preserved their independence; their language is, consequently, purer than that of the Birmans, who suffered various revolutions. The national name of the Arracan race is Ma-rum-ma, which seems to be only a corruption of Maha-vurma; Vurma being an appellation peculiar to tribes of Khetri extraction. A native of Arracan cannot, without extreme difficulty, articulate a word which has a consonant for a final.\n\nUntil the Birman conquest, the ancient government of Arracan had never been so completely subdued, as to acknowledge vassalage to a foreign power, although the Moguls and the Peguers had, at different periods, carried arms into the heart of the country. During the reign of Aurengzebe, the unfortunate Sultan Sujah, his brother, was put to death by the Arracan Rajah. The Portuguese, sometimes as allies, at others as open enemies, gained an establishment in the country, which decayed only with the general ruin of their interests in Asia.\n\nIn 1783 this province was conquered after a very faint resistance by the Birmans, and was followed by the surrender of Cheduba, Ramree, and the Broken Isles. Many of the Mughs, or subjects of the great Mogo, (a title assumed by the Arracan Rajahs) preferred flight to servitude, taking refuge in the Dumbuck hills, on the borders of Chittagong, and in the deep forests and jungles that skirt the frontier, where\nthey have formed themselves into tribes of independent robbers, and have since caused infinite vexation to the Birmans. Many have settled in the districts of Dacca and Chittagong, whilst others submitted quietly to the yoke.\n\nWhen the conquest was completed, Arracan, with its dependencies, was constituted a province of the Birman Empire, and a maywoon, or viceroy, was appointed to govern it. Sholamboo was the first invested with that office, and 1000 Birman soldiers were left to garrison the fort. Small parties were likewise distributed in the different towns, and many Birmans, who had obtained grants of lands, came with their families, and settled in the country, thereby adding to the security of the state. The dethroned Rajah Mahasunda died a natural death the first year of his captivity, and thus the reduction of Arracan was completed in a few months. (Symes, Cox, Leyden, F. Buchanan, Towers, Abul Fazel, &c.)\n\nArracan.\u2014A town in the Birman Empire, province of Arracan, of which it is the capital. Lat. 20\u00b0. 40'. N. Long. 93\u00b0. 5'. E. It is situated about two tides journey from the sea, on the west side of the Arracan River, which here expands to a noble sheet of water; but rising in the hills to the N. E. has but a short course.\n\nThis town and fort were taken by the Birmans, in 1783, after a feeble resistance. They found a considerable booty, but on nothing was a higher value placed than an image of Gaudma, (the Gautama of the Hindoos, a name of Buddha) made of brass, and highly burnished. The figure is about 10 feet high, and in the customary sitting posture, with the legs crossed and inverted, the left hand resting on the lap, the right pendent. This image is believed to be the original resemblance of the Reeshee (saint) taken from life, and it is so highly venerated, that pilgrims have for centuries been accustomed to come from the remotest countries, where the supremacy of Gaudma is acknowledged, to pay their devotions at the feet of his brazen representative. There were also five images of Racshyas, the demons of the Hindoos, of the same metal, and of gigantic stature, the guardians of the sanctuary.\n\nA singular piece of ordnance, of most enormous dimensions, was also found, composed of huge bars of iron, beaten into form. This ponderous cannon measured 30 feet in length, 2 and a half inches diameter at the mouth, and 10 inches in the calibre. It was transported by the Birmans to Ume-rapoor by water, as a military trophy, and Gaudma, with his infernal guards, were, in like manner, conveyed to the capital, with much pomp and superstitious parade.

E.\n\nASSAM, (ASAM.)\n\nAn extensive country to the north-east of Bengal, situated principally betwixt the 25th and 28th degrees of north latitude, and 94\u00b0. and 99\u00b0. of east longitude. In length Assam may be estimated at 700 miles, by 70 the average breadth. In a few places of Upper Assam, where the\nmountains recede furthest, the breadth considerably exceeds this proportion; but the probable area of the whole is 60,000 square miles.\n\nThis region is separated by the Brahmapootra into three grand divisions, called Ootrecole, or Ootrepah, Deccancole, or Deccanparah, and the Majuli. The first denotes the provinces lying to the north of the Brahmapootra, the second those to the south, and the third, the Majuli, a large island formed by the Brahmapootra. The country is subdivided into Upper and Lower Assam: the first includes the country above Coleabark, where the river diverges into two considerable streams, as far as the mountainous confines to the north and south. At an early period this included the whole of Assam; but the lower provinces, to the westward, having afterwards been annexed by conquest to the dominions of Surjee Deo, became a separate government.\n\nFrom the confines of Bengal, or Bisnee, at the Khondar Chokey, the valley, as well as the river and mountains, preserve a northern direction to a considerable distance, and incline to the east by north. In the upper provinces, Assam is bounded on the south-west by Bengal and Bisnee; on the north by the successive ranges of the mountains of Bootan, Auka, Duffala, and Miree; on the south by the Garrow mountains, which rise in proportion to their progress eastward, and change the name of Garrow to that of Naga. The valley is divided, throughout its whole length, by the Brahmapootra, into nearly equal parts. The Assam territory, when it is entered from Bengal, commences from the north of the Brahmapootra, at the Khondar Chokey, and at Nagrabaree Hill on the south.\n\nThe number and magnitude of the rivers in Assam, probably exceeds that of any other country in the world of equal extent: they are in general of a sufficient depth, at all seasons, to admit of a commercial intercourse on shallow boats; during the rains boats of the largest size find sufficient depth of water. The number of rivers, of which the existence has been ascertained, amounts to 61, including the Brahmapootra, and its two great branches, the Dehing and the Looicheh: 34 of these flow from the northern, and 24 from the southern mountains. The source of the Brahmapootra is unknown.\n\nMany of these rivers are remarkable for their extreme winding course: the Dekrung, although the direct distance of its course is only 25 miles, performs a winding course equal to 100 miles, before it falls into the Brahmapootra. This river (the Dekrung) is also famous for the quantity and quality of its gold; which metal is also found in other rivers of Assam, more especially near to the mountains.\n\nThe southern rivers are never rapid; the inundation commencing from the northern rivers fills both the Brahmapootra and southern rivers, so that the water has no considerable current until May or June.\n\nIn 1582 this country was described by Abul Fazel as follows:\u2014\"The dominions of Assam join to Camroop: he is a very powerful prince, lives in great state; and, when he dies, his principal attendants, both male and female, are voluntarily buried alive with his corpse.\"\n\nThe vegetable and animal productions of Assam are nearly the same with those of Bengal, which country it much resembles in its physical appearance and multitude of rivers. It furnishes, however, considerable quantities of gold, a metal Bengal is wholly without. This valuable commodity is found in all the small rivers of Assam, that flow from the northern and southern boundary hills, particularly from the first. It forms a great proportion of the Assam exportations to Bengal; the other articles being elephants teeth, lac, a very coarse species of raw silk, and a still coarser manufacture of\ncotton. Many other valuable articles might be discovered, but the extremely barbarous state of the country prevents commercial intercourse, few merchants choosing to venture further than the Company's frontier station of Goalparah. Of the imports from Bengal salt is the principal; the rest consist of arms and ammunition of all sorts, when they can be had, a few Dacca muslins and cloths, and a very trifling quantity of European commodities.\n\nNo probable estimate of the population of Assam can be formed, but it is known to be extremely thinly inhabited, 7-8ths of the country being desolate, and overgrown with jungle, although one of the most fertile on the face of the earth: this arises from the incessant warfare carried on by the petty rajahs with each other; occasionally some one gains the ascendancy, which during his life bestows a sort of calm over the country; but on his death the whole is to be settled over again. Rafts, covered with human heads, are sometimes seen floating down the Brahmapootra, past Goalparah, in Bengal; but whether these are the effect of hostilities, or are victims offered to some of their sanguinary deities, has never been properly ascertained. The chief town in Assam is Gergong, the rajah of which had, for a considerable period of time, the supremacy over the others, and was named the Swerrga Rajah, or Rajah of the Heavens; but since the insurrection of the Moanmarias, about 1790, the city, palaces, and fort, have been converted to a heap of ruins. Rungpoor, a military station, not far from Gergong, may be considered as the present principal strong hold of Assam.\n\nIn Assam there are several remarkable military causeways, which intersect the whole country, and must have been made with great labour; but it is not known at what period; the Mahomedans, however, found them in existence, on their first invasion of this country. One of them extends from Coos Bahar, in Bengal, through Ranganatty, to the extreme eastern limits of Assam.\n\nRespecting the language or religion of this region very little is known; but there is reason to believe the latter is the Brahminical. In the territory, bordering on the Company's frontier, the inhabitants use the same dialects as are common in the adjacent parts of Bengal. It may be supposed the history of this country remains in equal obscurity with the language and religion. In 1638, during the reign of Shah Jehan, the inhabitants of Assam sailed down the Brahmapootra, and invaded Bengal, but were repulsed by that emperor's officers, and eventually lost some of their own frontier provinces. In the reign of Aurengzebe, his general, Mauzum Khan, advanced from Cooch Bahar to attempt the conquest of Assam: he met with no obstacle but such as arose from the nature of the country, until he arrived at the capital Gergong. When the season of the rains began, the Assamese came out from their hiding places, and harassed the imperial army, which became very sickly, and the flower of the Afghans, Persians, and Moguls, perished. The rest tried to escape along the narrow causeways through the morasses; but few ever reached the Brahmapootra. After this expedition, the Mahomedans of Hindostan declared, that Assam was only inhabited by infidels, hobgoblins, and devils.\n\nAbout 1793 a detachment of troops was sent from Bengal into Assam, to assist and restore a fugitive rajah. They reached Gergong, the capital, without opposition, and effected their purpose; but they subsequently suffered greatly by the pestilential nature of the climate, which no constitution, either native or European, can withstand, and returned considerably diminished in number.\n\nOn this occasion Malha Rajah Surjec Deo, of Assam, highly sensible of the benefit he had experienced from the aid which had been afforded him by the Bengal government,\nagreed to abolish the injudicious system of commerce that had hitherto been pursued, and to permit a reciprocal liberty of commerce on the following conditions and duties, negotiated by Capt. Welsh, in Feb. 1793.\n\n**Imports to Assam.**\n\n1. That the salt from Bengal be subject to an impost of 10 per cent. on the supposed prime cost, reckoning that invariably at 500 rupees per 150 maunds, of 84 sicca weight to the seer.\n\n2. That the broad cloths of Europe, the cotton cloths of Bengal, carpets, copper, lead, tin, tutenague, pearls, hardware, jewelry, spices, and the various other goods imported into Assam, pay an equal impost of 10 per cent. on the invoice price.\n\n3. That warlike implements and military stores be considered contraband, and liable to confiscation, excepting the supply of those articles requisite for the Company's troops stationed in Assam, which, with every other article of clothing and provision for the troops, be exempted from all duties.\n\n**Exports from Assam.**\n\nThat the duties on all articles of export, such as Muggadooties, Mooga thread, pepper, elephants teeth, cutna lac, chupra and jung lac, monjeet, and cotton, be invariably 10 per cent, to be paid either in money or kind, as may be most convenient to the merchant. Rice, and all descriptions of grain, are wholly exempt from duties on both sides.\n\nFor the collection of these duties, it was agreed to establish customhouses and agents at the Candahar Chokey, and at Gwahatty; the first to collect the duties on all imports and exports, the produce of the country to the westward; and the second to collect the duties on all exports, the produce of the country parallel to it north and south, and also on all exports, the produce of the country to the eastward, as far as Nowgong.\n\nThe agents to receive a commission of 12 per cent. as a recompense for their trouble; and the standard fixed at 40 seers to the maund, (about 80 lbs.) 84 sicca weight to the seer.\n\nAs much political inconvenience had been experienced by both governments, from granting a general licence to the subjects of Bengal to settle in Assam, it was agreed that no European merchant or adventurer, of any description, should be allowed to fix their residence in Assam, without having previously obtained the permission of the British government, and of Maha Rajah Surjce Deo, of Assam.

In spite of the disparity of numbers, the British were completely victorious, although with severe loss in proportion to their numbers. The confederates fled from the field of battle, leaving above 1200 slain, 98 pieces of cannon, seven standards, and their whole camp equipage, many bullocks, and a large quantity of ammunition. This victory is the more remarkable, as above 10,000 of Sindia's infantry had been disciplined, and were in\npart officered by Frenchmen and other Europeans.\n\n**Assawan**, (Asivan).\u2014A town in the Nabob of Oude's territories, 32 miles W. from Lucknow. Lat. 36\u00b0 50'. N. Long. 86\u00b0 25'. E. This place is distant about a mile from Meahgunge, and is more pleasantly situated, overlooking a small lake; it has, however, been deserted for the latter place, and is mostly in ruins.\n\n**Atamalica**, (Atimallica).\u2014A town belonging to an independent Zemendar, in the province of Orissa, 70 miles N.

The fortress was built by Acher, A.D. 1581.\n\nIt is remarkable that the three great invaders of Hindostan, Alexander, Tamerlane, and Nadir Shah, in three distant ages, and with views and talents extremely different, advanced by the same route, with hardly any deviation. Alexander had the merit of discovering the way; after passing the mountains, he encamped at Alexandria Paropamisana, on the same site with the modern city of Candahar; and having subdued or conciliated the nations seated on the north-west bank of the Indus, he crossed the river at Taxila, now Attock, the only place where the stream is so tranquil that a bridge can be thrown over it.

N. Long. 76\u00b0 23'. E.\n\n---\n\n**AURUNGABAD.**\n\nA large province in the Deccan, situated principally betwixt the 18th and 21st degrees of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by the provinces of Gujrat, Khandesh, and Beedar; to the south by Bejaipoor and Beeder; to the east it has Berar and Hyderabad, and to the west the sea. In length it may be estimated at 300 miles by 160 the average breadth.\n\nThis province is also known by the names of Ahmednuggur and Dowletabad; the first having been its capital during the existence of the Nizam Shahee dynasty, and the latter during a short dynasty, established by Mallek Amber, an Abyssinian, from 1600 to 1635. The province was partially subdued during the reign of Acher, when its limits were in a constant state of fluctuation, until that of Shah Jehaun, in 1634, when Dowletabad, the capital, being taken, the whole country was converted to a soubah of the Mogul empire. The capital was then transferred from Dowletabad to the neighbouring town of Gurka; which, becoming the favourite residence of Aurengzebe, during his vicereignty of the Deccan, received the name of Aurungabad, which was subsequently communicated to the province.\nThe surface of Aurungabad is very irregular, and, in general, mountainous, particularly towards the western Ghauts, where the hills rise to a great elevation. It consequently possesses no rivers of magnitude, although it contains the sources of many, such as the Beemah and Godavery, that do not attain to any considerable size until they quit its limits. This province also abounds with natural fortresses and strong holds, which enabled the Maharattas, whose native country it is, to give such infinite trouble to Aurungzebe and his generals.\n\nA considerable difference must, of course, take place in the agriculture, according as the land is situated in the mountainous or low districts; but, upon the whole, the province is reckoned very fertile, and capable of exporting grain when not harassed by internal hostilities. Rice is the chief grain cultivated, the other vegetable productions are the same as in the rest of Hindostan generally, nor is there anything peculiar with respect to the animal or mineral kingdoms. Horses are raised in great numbers for the Maharatta cavalry; but though a hardy breed, they are neither strong nor handsome; they suit, however, the light weight of their riders.\n\nA great proportion of this province, and all the sea coast, being in the possession of the Maharattas, who are but little addicted to commerce, few observations occur on this head. Piracy was always the favourite occupation of such of that nation as ventured to trust themselves on the ocean, and for this they have been famous, or rather infamous, from the remotest antiquity. In modern times they continued to exercise this trade by sea, as they did a similar course of depredation by land, until both were coerced by the strong arm of the British power.\n\nThree fourths of this province are possessed by the Maharattas, and the remainder by the nizam, with the exception of the islands of Bombay and Salsette, which belong to the British. The Peshna is the chief Maharatta sovereign in this province, but there are numberless independent chiefs, who owe him only a feudal obedience, some of them possessing fortresses within sight of Poonah, his capital.\n\nThe principal towns are Aurungabad, Ahmednuggur, Dowletabad, Jalnapoor, Damaun, and Basseeen; and in this province are found the remarkable Hindoo mythological excavations of Carli and Ellora.\n\nThe population of this territory is in proportion much inferior to the best of the British provinces, and probably even to the worst. Although it has not of late suffered much from external invasion, yet it is but indifferently populated, the nature of the Maharatta government being, on the whole, rather unfavourable to an increase of inhabitants, who may be estimated in this extensive province not to exceed six millions. Of these a very great proportion are Hindoos, the Brachminical persuasion; the Mahommedans, in all likelihood, not exceeding one 20th of the aggregate.\n\nThe Maharatta is the language principally used, but there are besides various provincial dialects; and the Persian and Hindostani are frequently made use of in conversation, and public documents, by the higher classes.\n\nFor the more remote history of this region, see the words Deccan and Ahmednuggur; and, for the modern, the word Maharatta. (Wilks, Ferishta, &c.)\n\nAURUNGABAD.\u2014A city in the Deccan, the former capital of the province of Aurungabad. Lat. 19\u00b0. 46'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 3'. E.\n\nThis town was originally named Gurka, situated a few miles distant from Dowletabad, which being taken from the short-lived dynasty of Malik Amber, in 1634, the Moguls transferred the capital of their recent conquests from thence to the village of Gurka. It consequently rapidly\nIncreased in size, and, becoming the favourite residence of Aurangzebe, during his viceroyalty of the Deccan, it received the name of Aurungabad, which it eventually communicated to the province. This city continued the capital for some time after the nizams became independent of Delhi, until they quitted it for Hyderabad; probably on account of its proximity to the territories of the Maharattas. Aurungabad is now within the nizam's territories, and, like many other famous cities of Hindostan, much fallen from its ancient grandeur. The ruins of Aurangzebe's palace and gardens are still visible, and the fakir's tomb is described as a structure of considerable elegance in the eastern style. In the bazar, which is very extensive, various kinds of commodities, European and Indian, particularly silks and shawls, are exposed for sale; and the population, although much reduced, is still numerous.\u2014See Ahmednuggur, Dowletabad, and Deoghir.\n\nTravelling distance from Poonah, 186 miles; from Bombay, by Poonah, 284; from Hyderabad, 295; from Madras, 647; from Delhi, 750; and from Calcutta, 1022 miles. (Wilks, Rennell, &c.)\n\n---\n\nAVA AND THE BIRMAN EMPIRE.\n\nThis extensive region is situated in the south eastern extremity of Asia, usually distinguished by the name of India beyond the Ganges, and betwixt the ninth and 26th degrees of north latitude.\n\nThe empire of Ava now comprehends many large provinces that formed no part of the original Birman dominions, but which will be found described under their respective heads. To the north it is bounded by Assam and Tibet; to the south by the Indian Ocean and the Siamese territories; to the north-east it has the empire of China, and to the east the unexplored countries of Laos, Lactho, and Cambodia. On the west it is separated from the Bengal districts, Tipera and Chittagong by a ridge of mountains and the River Nanf.\n\nWhere not confined by the sea, the frontiers of this empire are in a perpetual state of fluctuation, but it appears to include the space betwixt the 9th and 26th degrees of north latitude, and the 92d and 104th of east longitude; about 1050 geographical miles in length, and 600 in breadth. It is probable the boundaries extend still further to the north, but the breadth varies considerably. Taken in its most extended sense, that is, including countries subject to their influence, the Birman dominions may contain 194,000 square miles, forming altogether the most extensive native government, subject to one sovereign authority, at present existing in India. Ava Proper is centrically situated, and surrounded by the conquered provinces; which are, Ariacan, Pegue, Martaban, Tenasserim, Junkseylon, Mergui, Tavay, Yunshan, Lowashan, and Cassay.\n\nFrom the River Nanf, on the frontiers of Chittagong, to the north end of the Negrals, are several good harbours; and from Tavoy to the southward of the Mergui Archipelago, are several others. The principal rivers are, the Irawaddy, the Keenduem, the Lokiang, and the Pegue River. Between the Pegue and Martaban rivers there is a lake, from which two rivers proceed; the one runs north to Old Ava, when it joins the Myoungnya, or Little Ava River, which comes from mountains on the frontiers of China; the other river runs south from the lake to the sea.\n\nJudging from the appearance and vigour of the natives, the climate must be very healthy. The seasons are regular, and the extremes of heat and cold seldom experienced; the duration of the intense heat, which precedes the commencement of the rains, being so short, that it inconveniences but very little. Exclusive of the Delta formed by the mouths of the\nIrawaddy, there is very little low land in the Birman dominions. The teak does not grow in this Delta, but in the hilly and mountainous districts to the northward and eastward of Rangoon. Even at a short distance from Syriam, the country is dry and hilly.\n\nThe soil of the southern provinces is remarkably fertile, and produces as abundant crops of rice as are to be found in the finest parts of Bengal. Farther northward the country becomes irregular and mountainous; but the plains and vallies, particularly near the river, are exceedingly fruitful. They yield good wheat, and the various kinds of small grain and legumes, which grow in Hindostan. Sugar canes, tobacco, of a superior quality, indigo, cotton, and the different tropical fruits, are all indigenous. In a district named Palongmiou, to the N.E. of Ummerapoor, the tea-leaf grows, but it is very inferior to the tea produced in China, and is seldom used but as a pickie. Besides the teak tree, which grows in many parts of Ava, both to the north of Ummerapoor, and in the southern country, there is almost every description of timber that is known in India. Fir is produced in the mountainous part of the country, from which the natives extract the turpentine, but they consider the wood of little value, on account of its softness. If it were conveyed to Rangoon, it might prove a beneficial material for the navigation of India. The teak tree, although it will grow on the plains, is a native of the mountains. The forests in Asia, like the woody and uncultivated parts of India, are extremely pestiferous. The wood-cutters are a particular class of men, born and bred in the hills, but they are said to be very unhealthy.\n\nThe kingdom of Ava abounds in minerals. Six days' journey from Bamoo, near the frontiers of China, there are mines of gold and silver, called Badouem; there are also mines of gold, silver, rubies, and sapphires, at present open on a mountain near the Keendvem, called Woobloootan; but the most valuable are in the vicinity of the capital, nearly opposite to Keoummcvum. Precious stones are found in several other parts of the empire. The inferior minerals, such as iron, tin, lead, antimony, arsenic, sulphur, &c. are met with in great abundance. Amber, of a consistence unusually pellucid and pure, is dug up in large quantities near the river; gold is likewise discovered in the sandy beds of streams, which descend from the mountains. Between the Keendvem and the Irawaddy, to the northward, there is a small river, called the Shoe Lien Kioup, or the Stream of Golden Sand.\n\nDiamonds and emeralds are not produced in the Ava empire, but it has amethysts, garnets, very beautiful chrysolites, jasper, and marble. The quarries of the latter are only a few miles from Ummerapoor. It is in quality equal to the finest marble of Italy, and admits of a polish that renders it almost transparent. This article is monopolized by government, it being held sacred, because the images of Gaudma are chiefly composed of this material.\n\nThis empire also contains the celebrated wells which produce the Petroleum oil\u2014an article in universal use throughout the Birman provinces, and realizing a large revenue to the government, it being one of the numerous royal monopolies.\u2014See YAY-NANGHEOUM.\n\nAn extensive trade is carried on between the capital of the Birman dominions and Yunnan, in China. The principal export from Ava is cotton, of which there is said to be two kinds; one of a brown colour for nankeen, and the other white, like the cotton of India. This commodity is transported up the Irawaddy in large boats, as far as Bamoo, when it is bartered at the common jee, or mart, with the Chinese merchants, and conveyed by the latter into the Chinese dominions. Amber, ivory, precious stones, betel nut, and the\nedible nests, brought from the eastern islands, are also articles of commerce; in return, the Birmans procure raw and wrought silks, velvets, gold leaf, preserves, paper, and some utensils of hardware.\n\nThe commerce betwixt the northern and southern quarters of the empire is greatly facilitated by the River Irawaddy, on which several thousand boats are annually employed in transporting rice from the lower provinces, to supply the capital and the northern districts, as also salt and gnapee (pickled sprats). Articles of foreign importation are mostly conveyed up the Irawaddy; a few are introduced by the way of Arracan, and carried over the mountains on men's heads. European broad cloth, a small quantity of hardware, coarse Bengal muslins, Cossimbazar silk handkerchiefs, china ware, and glass, are the principal commodities. Cocoa nuts, brought from the Nicobars, are looked upon as a delicacy, and bear a high price. Merchants carry down silver, lak, precious stones, and some other articles, but not to any great amount.\n\nIn 1795, the quantity of teak, and other timber, imported to Madras and Calcutta, from the Birman dominions, required a return amounting to the value of 200,000l. value, and the trade has since been progressively on the increase. Teak cannot be conveyed from the Malabar to the Coromandel coast, unless at so great an expense as to preclude the attempt. The imports to Ava, from the British dominions consist chiefly of coarse piece goods, glass, hardware, and broad cloth; the returns are almost wholly in timber. A small trade is also carried on with Prince of Wales Island. The maritime ports of this empire are commodities for shipping, and better situated for Indian commerce than those of any other power. Great Britain possesses the western side of the Bay of Bengal, and the government of Ava the eastern. The harbour of Negrais is particularly commodious.\n\nThe quantity of tonnage annually built in Ava for sale and exportation is estimated at 3000 tons.\n\nThe Birmans, like the Chinese, have no coin, silver in bullion and lead being the current monies of the country. What foreigners call a tackal, properly kiat, is the most general piece of silver in circulation. It weighs 10 pennyweights, 10 grains, and three-fourths. The subordinate currency is lead; and all common market articles, such as fish, flesh, rice, greens, &c. are sold for so many weights of lead, which being a royal monopoly, is raised in the markets far above its intrinsic value. The average price of rice at the capital is about 2s. 8d. for 84 pounds, at Rangoon and Martaban about 250 pounds for 2s. 8d. It is necessary for every merchant to have a banker to manage his money transactions, who is responsible for the quality of the metal, and charges a commission of one per cent.\n\nThe Indian nations, east of the Gauges, have always been more cautious in their intercourse with foreign states than those of the west. The courts of Ava and Pekin resemble each other in many respects, but in none more than in their vanity and pride, which often manifests itself in a ridiculous manner. Like the sovereign of China, his majesty of Ava acknowledges no equal. Boa, or emperor, is a title which the present King of the Birmans has assumed; the sovereign of China is termed Oudee Boa, or Emperor of Oudee, or China. The principal state officers at court are the following:\n\nFour woongees, or chief ministers of state. (Woon signifies burden.)\n\nFour woondocks, or assistant ministers.\n\nFour attawoons, or ministers of the interior.\n\nFour secretaries, or sere-dogees.\n\nFour nachangess, to take notes and report.\n\nFour sandegaans, who regulate the ceremonials.\nNine sandozains, whose business is to read petitions.\n\nIn the Birman dominions there are no hereditary dignities and employments\u2014all honours and offices, on the demise of the possessors, reverting to the crown. The tsalve, or chain, is the badge of the order of nobility. They are from three to 12, which is the highest; the king alone wears 24. Almost every article of use, as well as of ornaments, indicates the rank of the owner.\n\nIt is difficult to form any correct judgment regarding the population of the Birman dominions. It is said to contain 8000 cities, towns, and villages, without including Arracan. Few of the inhabitants live in solitary habitations; they mostly form themselves into small societies; and their dwellings, thus collected, compose their ruas, or villages. Col. Symes estimates them at 17,000,000, including Arracan, while Captain Cox, who succeeded him as ambassador, does not go beyond 8,000,000, which is, probably, much nearer the truth.\n\nOne-tenth of all produce is exacted as the authorized due of the government, and one-tenth is the amount of the king's duty on all foreign goods imported into his dominions. The revenue, arising from customs on imports, are mostly taken in kind. A small part is converted into cash, the rest is distributed and received in lieu of salaries to the various departments of the court. Money, except on pressing occasions, is never disbursed from the royal coffers. To one man the fees of an office are allowed; to another, a station where certain imports are collected; a third has land in proportion to the importance of his employment. By these donations they are not only bound in their own personal servitude, but likewise in that of all their dependents. They are called the slaves of the king; and, in their turn, their vassals are denominated slaves to them. The condition of these grants includes services during war, as well as the civil duties of office. Although it seems almost impossible, under such a system, to ascertain in any standard currency the amount of the royal revenue, yet the riches of the Birman sovereign are said to be immense, which is rendered probable by the circumstance, that a very small portion of what enters his exchequer, ever again returns into circulation\u2014the hoarding of money being a favourite maxim of oriental state policy.\n\nThe Birmans may be described as a nation of soldiers, every man in the kingdom being liable to be called on for his military services. The king has no standing army, except a few undisciplined native Christians, and renegadoes of all countries and religions, who act as artillery, a very small body of cavalry, and perhaps 2000 undisciplined, ill-armed, naked infantry. The armies are composed of levies raised on the spur of the occasion by the princes, chobwahs, and great lords; these holding their lands by military tenure. The utmost of all descriptions, probably, does not exceed 60,000 men. The infantry are armed with muskets and sabres, the cavalry with a spear\u2014all the latter are natives of Cassay. The breed of horses in Ava is small, but very active; and, contrary to the practice of other eastern countries, they castrate their horses.\n\nThe most respectable part of the Birman military force is their establishment of war boats. Every town of note in the vicinity of the river is obliged to furnish a certain number of men, and one or more war boats, in proportion to the magnitude of the place. At a very short notice, the king can collect 500 of these boats. They carry from 40 to 50 rowers, and there are usually 30 soldiers armed with muskets on board, together with a piece of ordnance on the prow. The rower is also provided with a sword and lance, which are placed by his side whilst he plies the oar. The musket was first introduced into the Pegue and Ava.\ncountries by the Portuguese, and are of the worst quality.\n\nThe principal provinces of the Birman Empire have been already specified\u2014the names of the most remarkable towns are Ummerapoor, the capital; Ava, the ancient capital; Monchaboo, the birth-place of Alompra; Pegne, Rangoon, Syiam, Prome, Negrais, Persaim, and Chagaing.\n\nAlmost all towns, and even villages, in the Birman country, are surrounded with a stockade, which kind of defence the Birmans are very expert at erecting.\n\nThe general disposition of the Birmans is strikingly contrasted with that of the natives of India, from whom they are separated only by a narrow range of mountains. The Birmans are a lively, inquisitive race, active, irascible, and impatient; the character of their Bengal neighbours is exactly the reverse.\n\nThe females in Ava are not concealed from the sight of men, but are suffered to have free intercourse as in Europe; in other respects, however, there are many degrading distinctions, and the Birman treatment of females, generally, is destitute both of delicacy and humanity. The practice of selling their women to strangers is not considered as shameful, nor is the female dishonoured. They are seldom unfaithful, and often essentially useful to their foreign masters, who are not allowed to carry their temporary wives along with them. Infidelity is not a characteristic of Birman wives; in general, they have too much employment to have leisure for corruption.\n\nIn their features the Birmans bear a nearer resemblance to the Chinese than to the natives of Hindostan. The women, especially in the northern part of the empire, are fairer than the Hindoo females, but are not so delicately formed. The men are not tall in stature, but are active and athletic. They have a very youthful appearance, from the custom of plucking the beard, instead of using the razor. Marriages are not contracted until the parties reach the age of puberty. The contract is purely civil, the ecclesiastical jurisdiction having nothing to do with it. The law prohibits polygamy, and recognizes only one wife, but concubinage is admitted to an unlimited extent. When a man dies intestate, three-fourths of his property go to his children born in wedlock, and one-fourth to his widow. The Birmans burn their dead.\n\nThe Birmans, both men and women, colour their teeth, their eyelashes, and the edges of their eyelids with black.\n\nIn their food, compared with the Indians, the Birmans are gross and uncleanly. Although their religion forbids the slaughter of animals in general, yet they apply the interdiction only to those that are domesticated. All game is eagerly sought after, and in many places publicly sold. Reptiles, such as lizards, guanas, and snakes, constitute a part of the subsistence of the lower classes. To strangers they grant the most liberal indulgence, and if they chance to shoot at, and kill a fat bullock, it is ascribed to accident.\n\nAmong the Birmans the sitting posture is the most respectful, but strangers are apt to attribute to insolence, what in their view is a mark of deference. The Birman houses are, in general, raised three or four feet from the ground, on wooden posts or bamboos, which is the case with the huts of the meanest peasant in the empire. They are composed wholly of bamboos and mats, and but indifferently thatched. Gilding is forbidden to all Birmans; liberty even to lacker and paint the pillars of their houses is granted to few.\n\nIn this empire every thing belonging to the king has the word shoe, or gold prefixed to it; even his majesty's person is never mentioned, but in conjunction with that precious metal. When a subject means to affirm that the king has heard any thing, he\nsays, \"It has reached the golden ears;\" he who has obtained admittance to the royal presence, has been at the \"golden feet.\" The perfume of Otto of roses is described as being grateful to the \"golden nose.\" Gold among the Birmans is the type of excellence, yet, although highly valued, it is not used for coin in the country. It is employed sometimes in ornaments for the women, and in utensils and ear-rings for the men; but much the greatest quantity is expended in gilding their temples, in which vast sums are continually lavished.\n\nThe Birman sovereign is sole proprietor of all the elephants in his dominions, and the privilege to ride on, or keep one of these animals, is an honour granted only to men of the very first rank. In Hindostan female elephants are prized beyond males, on account of their being more tractable; but, in Ava, it is the reverse, females being never used on state occasions, and seldom for ordinary riding. The henza, the symbol of the Birman nation, as the eagle was of the Roman empire, is a species of wild fowl, called in India the Brahminy goose. It is a remarkable circumstance, that there should not be such an animal as a jackal in the Ava dominions.\n\nThe Birmans of high rank have their barges drawn by war boats, it being thought inconsistent with their dignity for great men to be in the same boat with common watermen. It is customary also for a person of distinction journeying on the water, to have houses built for his accommodation, at the places where he means to stop. The materials of these houses are always easy to be procured, and the structure is so simple, that a spacious and comfortable dwelling, suited to the climate, may be erected in little more than four hours. Bamboos, grass for thatching, and the ground rattan, are all the materials requisite; not a nail is used in the whole edifice; and, if the whole were to fall, it would scarcely crush a lap-dog. Notwithstanding the well-formed arches of brick that are still to be seen in many of the ancient temples, yet Birman workmen can no longer turn them, which shews how easily an art once well known may be lost. Masonry, in the latter ages, has not been much attended to; wooden buildings have superseded the more solid structures of brick and mortar.\n\nThe Pali language constitutes, at the present day, the sacred text of Ava, Pegue, and Siam, and is nearly allied to the sanscrit of the Brahmins. The character in common use throughout Ava and Pegue is a round Nagari, derived from the square Pali, or religious text. It is formed of circles and segments of circles variously disposed, and is written from left to right. The common books are composed of the palmyra leaf, on which the letters are engraved with styles.\n\nIt is a singular fact, that the first version of Sir William Jones's translation of the Institutes of Hindoo Law, should be made into the Birman language. It was completed for the Ava sovereign, by an Armenian, in 1795.\n\nThe laws of the Birmans, like their religion, are Hindoo; in fact, there is no separating their laws from their religion. The Birmans call their code Derma Sath, or Sastra. It is one of many of the commentaries on Menu. Their system of jurisprudence, like that of the Chinese, provides specifically for almost every species of crime that can be committed; and adds a copious chapter of precedents to guide the inexperienced, in cases where there is any doubt or difficulty. Trial by ordeal and imprecation are the only absurd passages in the book, which, on the subject of females, is to a European offensively indecent.\n\nThe inhabitants of Ava constantly write the name Bamma; though, from affecting an indistinct pronunciation, they often term themselves Byamma, Bomma, and Myamma, which are only vocal corruptions of the written name.\n\nThe Birmans are not shackled by\nany prejudices of cast, restricted to hereditary occupations, or forbidden from participating with strangers in every social bond, like the Hindoos of the Brahminical religion. At present their laws are described as being wise, and pregnant with sound morality; and their police as better regulated than in most European countries. A knowledge of letters is so widely diffused, that there are no mechanics, and few of the peasants, or even the common watermen, who cannot read and write in the vulgar tongue. Few, however, understand the more scientific, or sacred volumes. All kionums, or monasteries, are seminaries for the education of youth, to which the surrounding inhabitants send their children, where they are educated gratis by the Rahaans, or monks. The latter never buy, sell, or accept money.\n\nThe Birman year is divided into 12 months of 29 and 30 days alternately, which they rectify by an intercalation every third year. They reckon the month from the beginning to the full moon, after which they recede by retrogressive enumeration until the month is finished. The week is divided into seven days, as in Hindostan. The Christian year 1795 corresponds with the Birman year 1157, and the Mahommedan year 1209.\n\nThe Birmans are extremely fond both of poetry and music, and possess epic as well as religious poems of high celebrity. They are accustomed to recite in verse the exploits of their kings and generals. In the royal library the books are ranged with great regularity, the contents of each chest being written in gold letters on the lid. It is said to contain more books on divinity than on any other subject; but there are separate works on history, music, medicine, painting, and romance. If all the other chests were as well filled as those submitted to the inspection of Col. Symes, it is probable his Birman majesty possesses a more numerous library than any other Asiatic sovereign.\n\nBuddha (of whom the Birmans are sectaries, as the Hindoos are of Brahma) is admitted by Hindoos of all descriptions to be the 9th Avatar, or descent of the Deity in the character of preserver. He reformed the doctrines contained in the Vedas, and severely censured the sacrifice of cattle, or depriving any thing of life. His place of birth and residence is supposed to have been Gaya in Bahar.\n\nGautama, or Gautom, according to the Hindoos of India, or Gaudma among the inhabitants of the more eastern parts, is said to have been a philosopher, and is believed by the Birmans to have flourished 2300 years ago. He taught in the Indian schools the heterodox religion and philosophy of Buddha. The image that represents Buddha is called Gandma, or Goutum, which is a commonly-received appellation of Buddha himself. This image is the primary object of worship in all countries (except Assam and Cassay) situated between Bengal and China. The sectaries of Buddha contend with those of Brahma for antiquity, and are certainly more numerous. The Cingalese, in Ceylon, are Buddhists of the purest source, and the Birmans acknowledge to have received their religion from that island, which they name Zehoo. The Rahaans (Birman monks) say it was brought first from Zehoo to Arracan, and thence was introduced into Ava, and probably into China. The Bonzes of the latter country, like the Rahaans of Ava, wear yellow as the sacerdotal colour, and in many of their customs and ceremonies have a striking similitude. Sir Wm. Jones determines the period, when Buddha appeared on the earth, to be 1014 years before the birth of our Saviour.\n\nThe Birmans believe in the metempsychosis, and that having undergone a certain number of transmigrations, their souls will, at last, either be received into their Olympus, on the mountain Meru, or be sent to suffer torments in a place of divine\npunishments. Notwithstanding the Birmans are Hindoos of the sect of Buddha, and not disciples of Brahma, they nevertheless reverence the Brahmins, and acknowledge their superiority in science over their own priests. The king and all the chief officers have always in their houses some of these domestic sages, who supply them with astrological advice.\n\nThe Birmans do not inflict on themselves disgustful tortures after the manner of the Hindoos, but they deem it meritorious to mortify the flesh by the voluntary penance of abstinence and self-denial. Like the other sectaries of Buddha, they are much attached to their lares, or domestic gods. A Burman family is never without an idol in some corner of the house, made of wood, alabaster, or silver.\n\nThe Kiooms, or convents of the Rhahaans, are different in their structure from common houses, and much resemble the architecture of the Chinese. They are entirely made of wood, comprehending in the inside one large hall, open at all sides. There are no apartments for the private recreations of the Rhahaans\u2014publicity is the prevailing system of Burman conduct. They admit of no secrets either in church or state.\n\nYellow is the only colour worn by the priesthood. They have a long loose cloak, which they wrap round them, so as to cover most part of their body. They profess celibacy, and abstain from every sensual indulgence. The juniors are restricted from wandering about licentiously, the head of every convent having a discretionary power to grant or refuse permission to go abroad. The Rhahaans, or priests, never dress their own victuals, holding it an abuse to perform any of the common functions of life, which may divert them from the contemplation of the divine essence. They receive the contributions of the laity ready dressed, and prefer cold food to hot. At the dawn of day they begin to perambulate the town, to collect supplies for the day; each convent sending forth a certain number of its members, who walk at a quick pace through the streets, and support with the right arm a blue lacquered box, in which the donations are deposited. These usually consist of boiled rice, mixed with oil, dried and pickled fish, sweetmeats, fruit, &c. During their walk they never cast their eyes to the right or to the left, but keep them fixed on the ground. They do not stop to solicit, and seldom even look at the donors. They eat but once a day, at the hour of noon. A much larger quantity of provisions is commonly procured than suffices for the members of the convent; the surplus is disposed of as charitably as it was given, to the needy stranger, or the poor scholars, who daily attend them to be instructed in letters, and taught their moral and religious duties. In the various commotions of the empire, the Rhahaans have never taken any active part, or publicly interfered in politics, or engaged in war; and the Birmans and Peguers, professing the same religion, whoever were conquerors, equally respected the ministers of their faith.\n\nThere were formerly nunneries of virgin priestesses, who, like the Rhahaans, wore yellow garments, cut off their hair, and devoted themselves to chastity and religion; but these societies were long ago abolished, as being injurious to the population of the state. At present there are a few old women, who shave their heads, wear a white dress, follow funerals, and carry water to convents. These venerable dames have some portion of respect paid to them.\n\nAva abounds in praws, or temples, in a ruinous state, yet new ones are daily erecting. For this the Birmans assign as a reason, that, though to mend a decayed temple be an act of piety, yet it is not so meritorious as to erect a new one. Those whose finances cannot erect a new one, content themselves with repairing an old one.\n\nLike all eastern nations, the Bir-\nmans are fond of processions; such as a funeral accompanied by a pompous public burning, or the ceremony of admitting youths into the convent of Rhahaans. The age of induction is from 8 to 12 years.\n\nFrom the testimony of the Portuguese historians, it appears, that in the middle of the 16th century, four powerful states occupied the regions that lie between the south-eastern province of British India, Yunnan in China, and the Eastern Sea. Their territories extended from Cassay and Assam on the N. W. as far S. as the Island of Junkseylon. These nations were known to Europeans by the names of Aracan, Ava, Pegue, and Siam. Ava, the name of the ancient capital of the Birman, has usually been accepted as the name of the country at large, which is Miamma, and named Zomien by the Chinese.\n\nThe Portuguese authors say, that the Birmans, though formerly subject to the King of Pegue, became afterwards masters of Ava, and caused a revolution at Pegue about the middle of the 16th century. The Portuguese assisted the Birmans in their wars against the Peguers, and continued to exercise an influence in the Birman and Pegue countries, and still greater in Arracan, so long as they maintained an ascendancy over the other European nations in the east. During the reign of Louis XIV., several splendid attempts were made to propagate the doctrines of the church of Rome, and advance the interest of the French nation in the kingdom of Siam, but little is related of Ava or Pegue.\n\nThe supremacy of the Birmans over the Peguers continued throughout the 17th, and during the first 40 years of the 18th century, when the Peguers in the provinces of Dalla, Martaban, Tongho, and Prome, revolted; a civil war ensued, which was prosecuted on both sides with the most savage ferocity. About the years 1750 and 1751, the Peguers, by the aid of arms procured from Europeans trading to their ports, and with the assistance of some renegade Dutch and native Portuguese, gained several victories over the Birmans. In 1752 they invested Ava, the capital, which surrendered at discretion. Dweepdee, the last of a long line of Birman kings, was made prisoner, with all his family, except two sons, who effected their escape to the Siamese. Bouna Della, or Beinga Delta, the Pegue sovereign, when he had completed the conquest of Ava, returned to his own country.\n\nA man now arose to rescue his country from this state of subjugation. Alompra, (the founder of the present dynasty,) a man of low extraction, then known by the name of Aundzea, or huntsman, was continued by the conqueror in the chiefship of Monchaboo, at that time an inconsiderable village. His troops at first consisted of only 100 picked men, with whom he defeated the Peguers in several small engagements; after which, his forces increasing, he suddenly advanced and obtained possession of Ava, the inhabitants of which, on his approach, expelled the Peguers. These events took place about the autumn of the year 1753.\n\nIn these wars the French favoured the Peguers, while the English leaned to the Birmans. In 1754 the Peguers sent an army and fleet of boats to retake Ava, but were totally defeated by Alompra, after an obstinate and bloody battle. From this period the Pegue power seemed hastening to its wane; yet they still prosecuted the war, and massacred the aged King of the Birmans, and other prisoners of that nation, under pretence of apprehended treachery. Upon this the Birmans in the districts of Prome, Denoobeu, Loonzay, &c., revolted, and exterminated the Pegue garrisons in their towns. The eldest son of the late king now wished to regain the throne of his ancestors; but, as this did not suit the views of the successful adventurer, Alompra, he compelled him to take refuge among the Siamese. In 1754\nBeinga Della, the Pegue King, besieged Prome; but his army was again defeated, with great slaughter, by Alompra, who followed them so closely in their retreat, as to transfer the seat of war to the mouths of the navigable rivers, and the numerous creeks and canals that intersect the lower provinces of Pegue.\n\nOn the 21st of April, 1755, Alompra attacked and totally defeated Apporaza, the King of Pegue's brother; after which the Peguers deserted Bassien, which was no longer a place of safety, and withdrew to Syriam. About the year 1754 Alompra subdued the Cassayer, who had revolted, and on his return south, in 1756, attacked and took the town and fortress of Syriam by surprise, after a long blockade. The commandant, and greater part of the garrison, escaped to Pegue; many, however, were slain, and all the Europeans made prisoners. It appears all along to have been the determined policy of the French to espouse the cause of the Peguers; but their assistance and supplies arrived too late, when all communication with the sea was cut off. Monsieur Dupleix, the governor of Pondicherry, sent two ships; but the first that arrived was decoyed up the river, taken, and the whole crew massacred; the second escaped by being accidentally delayed, and carried the fatal intelligence to Pondicherry.\n\nThe fall of Syriam determined the fate of the Peguers: cut off from all communication with the western countries of Dalla and Bassien, deprived of the navigation of the Rangoon River and the Irawaddy, and shut out from all foreign aid, their resources failed them, and supplies by water could no longer reach them. In January, 1757, Alompra undertook the siege of the city of Pegue; and the mode he adopted was that of circumvallation, which was a favourite practice of warfare among the Birmanas, and famine, a weapon on which they place great reliance. This plan proved effectual; for a negociation was opened, which terminated in an agreement, that the Pegue King should govern his country, under the stipulation of doing homage to the Birman monarch. A preliminary of these conditions was the surrender of the daughter of the Pegue sovereign to the victor. Notwithstanding all these arrangements, in their nature truly Asiatic, Alompra endeavoured to obtain possession of the town by treachery, and at last obtained his object by famine, when he abandoned it to indiscriminate plunder and massacre.\n\nThe Tallien, or Pegue government being extinct, by the surrender of their capital, it became necessary for foreigners to conciliate the new sovereign; accordingly Ensign Lyster was sent as envoy by the British factory at the Negrais, who had an interview with Alompra on board his boat, while proceeding to his capital. His majesty, on this occasion, assumed a very lofty tone; boasted of his invincible prowess, and enumerated the royal captives of the Pegue family, who were led prisoners in his train.\n\nIn 1757 the Peguers revolted, and expelled the viceroy placed over them; but were afterwards overthrown, in a severe engagement, near Rangoon, and the arrival of Alompra in person finally crushed the insurrection. He afterwards reduced the town and district of Tavay, where many Peguers had taken refuge; he then determined to chastise the Siamese, for the encouragement they had given to his rebellious subjects. His fleet proceeded to Mergui, while his army advanced by land; and the town, being ill fortified, was soon taken. Leaving a garrison for its defence, the Birmans marched against Tenasserim, a large and populous town, surrounded by a wall and stockade; notwithstanding which it made a feeble defence.\n\nAfter a very short halt at Tenasserim, he undertook an expedition\nagainst the capital of Siam; but, from various impediments, a month elapsed before he reached the vicinity of that metropolis, which was well prepared for a vigorous defence. Two days after the Birman army had erected their stockades, Alompra was taken ill of a disease, which in the end proved mortal. He gave orders for an immediate retreat, in hopes of reaching his capital alive; his intentions, however, were frustrated; for death overtook him within two days march of Martaban, where he expired about the 15th May, 1760, after a short and active reign of only eight years, and before he had completed the 50th year of his age.\n\nDuring his reign the wisdom of his counsels secured what his valour had acquired: he issued severe edicts against gambling, and prohibited the use of spirituous liquors throughout his dominions; he reformed the courts of justice, and abridged the power of the magistrates; every process of importance being decided in public, and every decree registered.\n\nHe was succeeded by his eldest son Namdojee Praw, who experienced considerable difficulty at first by the rebellion of his brother Shembuan, and afterwards by that of Meinla Rajah, the principal general of his deceased father. Both these revolts he successfully subdued, although the latter opponent had obtained possession of Ava, the capital, which was recaptured by blockade, and all the garrison who could not effect their escape, put to death. Naundogee likewise reduced the fort of Tougho, and took prisoner one of his uncles who had rebelled, whom he spared, but punished the other ringleaders with death. The three succeeding years were employed in reducing the refractory to obedience, principally the Peguens. He died at his capital, about the month of March, 1764, after a reign of little more than three years, leaving one son, named Momien, yet an infant.\n\nOn his decease, his brother Shembuan assumed the reins of government; nor is it ascertained that he ever acknowledged holding them in trust for the minor, whom he educated in obscurity among the Rha-haans, or monks. In 1765 he sent an expedition against the Siamese, with partial success, and went himself against the Munipoor Cassayers, where he acquired considerable booty. In 1766 the Birman armies marched south, and had an action with the Siamese, about eight days journey from the Port of Siam, when they were victorious; after which they laid siege to the city of Siam, and took it on capitulation, after a long blockade\u2014the favourite system of Birman warfare.\n\nIn 1767, or 1131 of the Birman era, the Chinese sent an army of 50,000 men from the western frontier of Yunnan, which advanced as far into the country as the village of Chiboo, where they were hemmed in by the Birmans. The Tartar cavalry, on whose vigour and activity the Chinese army depended for provisions, could no longer venture out, either to procure provisions, or to protect convoys. In this situation their army was attacked, and wholly destroyed, except about 2500, whom the Birmans sent in fetters to the capital, where they were compelled to ply their trades according to the royal pleasure. They were also encouraged to marry Birman wives, as are all strangers, and to consider themselves as Birmans.\n\nThis custom of the Birmans is singular among the civilized countries of the east, and peculiarly remarkable in a people, who derive their tenets from a Hindoo source. It is well known that in China, even the public prostitutes are strictly prohibited from having intercourse with any other than a Chinese; nor is any foreign woman permitted to enter the territories, or visit the ports of that jealous nation. Hindoo women, of good casts, are no less inaccessible, and admission into a re-\nspectable east is not attainable by money.\n\nThe Siamese, soon after the Birman army had quitted their territory, revolted. In 1771, Deeberdee, the general who had before subdued them, was detached to punish them; but, from different obstacles, was compelled to retreat without penetrating into the country. A new general was appointed; but the Peguers in the Birman army suddenly rose on their companions, commenced an indiscriminate massacre, and pursued them to the gates of Rangoon, which they besieged, but were unable to capture.\n\nIn 1774 Shembuan sent an army, which subdued the Cassay country, and took the capital Munipoor; but 10,000 men having gone forward to effect the conquest of the Cachar country, they were totally destroyed by the Cachars and the hill fever, within three days march of Cospoor, the capital. A second expedition, the same year, was more successful, and compelled the Cachar Rajah to pay tribute: this year also the district and fort of Martaban were retaken from the revolted Peguers.\n\nIn 1775 Shembuan sailed down the Irawaddy, with an army of 50,000 men; and, in the month of October, arrived at Rangoon, where he put to death Beinga Della, the old and unfortunate Pegue monarch, and many Tallien, or Pegue nobles.\n\nIn 1776 Shembuan left Rangoon, and was taken ill in the road to Ava, where he died soon after his arrival, having reigned about 12 years. His character is that of an austere, intelligent, and active prince. He reduced the petty sovereigns of several neighbouring provinces to a state of permanent vassalage, who had before only yielded to desultory conquest. These he compelled, on stated periods, to repair to the capital, and pay homage at the golden feet. Among them were numbered the Lords of Sandipoor, (Cambodia) Zemec, Quantong; and Bamoo, together with the Carrianers, the Kayns, and other uncivilized tribes, inhabiting the western hills and mountainous tracts that intersect the regions east of the Irawaddy.\n\nShembuen was succeeded by his son Chequza, aged 18, who proved a debauched, blood-thirsty monster, and was dethroned, and put to death by his uncle, Mindragjee Praw, in 1782, after a short, but (as far as refers to foreign wars) tranquil reign of six years.\n\nMindragjee Praw was the fourth son of the great Alompra, the founder of the dynasty. One of his first acts was to drown his nephew Momien (the son of Namdojee Praw, the second sovereign) by fixing him betwixt two jars, which were sunk in the stream, conformably to the Birman mode of executing members of the royal family. When he ascended the throne he was 43 years of age, and had two sons already grown up to man's estate. He had enjoyed the throne but a short time, when he had nearly been deprived both of life and diadem, by a desperado, named Magoung, who, with about 100 confederates, attacked him and his guards in his own palace, where they all perished.\n\nDuring his days of leisure this king had directed much of his attention to astronomical studies, and became a thorough believer in judicial astrology. Brahmins, who, though inferior in sanctity to the Rhabaans, are nevertheless held in high respect by the Birmans, had long been accustomed to migrate from Cassy and Arracan to Ava. Mindragjee Praw appointed a certain number of them his domestic chaplains; and, prompted by their persuasions, he determined to withdraw the seat of government from Ava, and found a new metropolis, which he did at Ummepoor.\n\nIn the year 1783 (corresponding with the Birman year 1145) he sent a fleet of boats against Arracan, which was conquered, after a slight resistance, and Mahasunda, the rajah, and his family, made prisoners. The\nsurrender of Cheduba, Ramree, and the Broken Isles, followed the conquest of Arracan.\n\nAlthough the Birmans could not retain the inland parts of Siam, they preserved the dominion over the sea coast as far as Mergui. In the year 1785 they attacked the island of Junkseylon, with a fleet of boats and an army; but, although first successful, were ultimately compelled to retreat with considerable loss. The Birman monarch, whose pride was deeply mortified by this, resolved to repair the disgrace; and, in 1786, invaded Siam with an army of 30,000 men, but was totally defeated, near the frontiers, by Pietiek Single, the King of Siam, his useless cannon taken, and himself with great difficulty escaping captivity. The Birmans, in this action, ascribe their defeat to the incumbrance of their cannon, which were old ship guns, mounted on old carriages.\n\nIn the year 1790 the Siamese obtained possession of Tavay by treachery, which the Birmans, in 1791, regained by the same means; and that year compelled the Siamese to raise the siege of Mergui. In 1793 peace was concluded with the Siamese, who ceded to the Birmans the western maritime towns as far south as Mergui, thus yielding to them the entire possession of the coast of Tenasserim, and the two important sea ports of Mergui and Tavay.\n\nIn 1795 his Birman majesty, learning that three distinguished robbers, from the Birman dominions in Arracan, had taken refuge in the British district of Chittagong, without communicating his intention, or in any shape demanding the fugitives, thought proper to order a body of 5000 men, under an officer of rank, to enter the Company's territories, with positive injunctions to the commander not to return, unless he brought with him the delinquents, dead or alive; and further to support this detachment, an army of 20,000 men was held in readiness at Arracan. In consequence of this irruption, a strong detachment was sent from Calcutta, a battalion of Europeans by water, and the native sepoys by land, under the command of General Erskine.\n\nSeree Nunda Kiozo, the Birman chief, to whom the task of reclaiming the fugitives was assigned, after his army had crossed the river, and encamped on the opposite bank, dictated a letter to the British judge and magistrate of Chittagong, acquainting him with the reasons of the inroad, and that the capture of the delinquents was his sole object, without harbouring any design of hostilities against the English. At the same time he declared, in a peremptory style, that until they were given up, he would not depart from the Company's territories; and, in confirmation of this menace, fortified his camp with a stockade. These matters being reported to government, the magistrate of Chittagong was ordered to apprehend the refugees, and keep them in safe custody until further directions.\n\nOn the approach of General Erskine, Seree Nunda Kiozo sent a flag of truce, proposing terms of accommodation, stipulating for the surrender of the fugitives, as the basis of the agreement. The general replied, that no terms could be listened to while the Birmans continued on English ground; but that as soon as they should withdraw from their fortified camp, and retire within their own frontier, he would enter on the subject of their complaints; notifying also, that unless they evacuated the Company's possessions in a limited time, force would be used to compel them. The Birman chief, in a manly confidence of the British character, personally waited on General Erskine, and disclosed to him the nature of his instructions, the enormity of the offenders, and the outrages they committed. General Erskine assured him it was far from the intention of the British government to screen delinquents, but that it was\nimpossible for him to recede from his first determination. The Birman general agreed to withdraw his troops, and the retreat was conducted in the most orderly manner; nor had one act of violence been committed by the Birman troops, during their continuance in the Company's districts. The guilt of the refugees being afterwards established, they were delivered over to the Birman magistrates, by whose sentence two out of the three underwent capital punishment. (Symes, Cox, Leyden, F. Buchanan, Dalrymple, &c.)\n\nAva.\u2014A town in the Birman Empire, properly named Aingwa, four miles west from the new capital, Ummerapoor. Lat. 21\u00b0. 51'. N. Long. 95\u00b0. 58'. E.\n\nThis place is divided into the upper and lower city, both of which are fortified, the lower being about four miles in circumference. It is protected by a wall 30 feet high, at the foot of which there is a deep and broad fosse. The communication betwixt the fort and the country is over a mound of earth crossing the ditch that supports a causeway; the wall is sustained on the inside by an embankment of earth. The upper or smaller fort does not exceed a mile in circumference, and is much the strongest, but all the walls are mouldering to decay. The materials of the houses, which consisted principally of wood, were transported to the new city of Ummerapoor; but the ground, when not covered with grass, still retains traces of former buildings and streets. The disposition of the latter nearly resembles that of Ummerapoor.\n\nIn the temple of Logathero Praw is still to be seen a gigantic image of Gaudma, of marble, seated in its customary position on a pedestal. The height of the idol, from the top of the head to the pedestal on which it sits, is nearly 24 feet; the head is eight feet in diameter, and across the breast it measures 10 feet. The Birmans assert, that it is composed of one entire block of marble; nor, on the closest inspection, can any junction be perceived. The building has evidently been erected over the idol, as the entrance would scarcely admit the introduction of his head.\n\nWithin the fort stands a temple of superior sanctity, named Shoegunga Praw, in which all oaths of consequence are administered, the breach of which is considered as a most heinous crime. How this temple obtained so eminent a distinction is not now known. Besides these there are numerous temples, on which the Birmans never lay sacrilegious hands, dilapidating by the corrosion of time; indeed, it would be difficult to exhibit a more striking picture of desolation and ruin.

The largest islands are named Babman, Calayan, Dalupiri, Camiguen, and Fuga, and are from 20 to 30 miles each in circumference. Besides these, there are many small rocky isles.\n\nThe Babuyanes Isles, although so far north, are much infested by the piratical cruisers from Magindarao. (Forrest, &c.)\n\n**Backar, (Bhacar).**\u2014A district extending along the Indus, in the province of Mooltan, situated principally betwixt the 28th and 30th degrees of north latitude. In 1582, it is described by Abul Fazel as follows:\n\n\"Doabeh Behker, containing 12 mahals, measurement 282,013 bee-gahs; revenue, 18,424,947 dams. Seyarghal, 60,419 dams. This district furnishes 4690 cavalry, and 11,100 infantry.\"\n\nThe chief town is Backar; but, respecting the country generally, we have, in modern times, had but little information. A considerable proportion of the district is composed of barren unfertile sand.\n\n**Backar.**\u2014A town in the province of Mooltan, situated on an island formed by the Indus, near its junction with the Durnmoodiy. Lat. 28\u00b0. 31'. N. Long. 70\u00b0. 2'. E. In 1582, it is described by Abul Fazel as follows:\n\n\"Behkoor is a good fort, which, in ancient books, is called Munsoorah. All the six rivers which pass through Lahore proceed past Behkoor in a collected stream, after having divided into two, one going to the north, and the other to the south of the fort. Here is very little rain, but the fruit is delicious.\"\n\nIn 1758, when Dara Shekoh fled from his brother Aurengzebe, he directed his course towards Sindy, taking possession of the strong fort of Backar, which afterwards stood a considerable siege. (Abul Fazel, Bernier, &c.)\n\n**Backergunge, (Bacargunj).**\u2014A district in the province of Bengal, formed about the year 1800, from the southern quarter of the Dacca Jelapore district. A considerable proportion of this division, named Boklah, or Ismaelpoor, extends chiefly along the western bank of the Pud dah, or Great Gauges, nearly to its mouth at the Island of Rabnabad, which forms the south-east angle of the Bengal Delta; the west of Hidgellee being the other. About the year 1854 this district was overwhelmed and laid waste by an inundation; and, from the succeeding ravages of the Mughls, aided by the Portuguese, who then inhabited Chittagong, it continues to this day greatly depopulated.\n\nThe lands are very capable of cul-\ntivation, notwithstanding their proximity to the sea, being annually, during the periodical rains, overflowed by the fresh water of, and fertilized by, the slimy mould deposited by the Ganges.\n\nThe country, being so well supplied with moisture, produces two abundant crops of rice annually, furnishing a considerable proportion of the grain which is consumed in, and exported from Calcutta. For the latter purpose the dry season crop produced during the cold weather answers best. From the vicinity of this division to the Sunderbunds, being in a manner part of it, the innumerable rivers by which it is intersected, and the quantity of jungle still covering its surface, it not only abounds with alligators and tigers of the most enormous size, but is also infested by dacoits, or river pirates, who rob in gangs to a greater degree than any other district in Bengal.\n\nA strong establishment of boats and sepoys is kept up at Backergunge, but their efforts have hitherto been totally unavailing to suppress, or even diminish the number of these depredators, who appear to increase all over the lower districts of Bengal. These dacoities, or gang robberies, are often attended with murder and torture, to compel the disclosure of concealed treasure; and always on the subsequent trials with perjury, and subornation of perjury, practised for the most atrocious purposes.\n\nThe obstacles to the suppression of these crimes do not arise from any open resistance to the magisterial authority, but from the extreme difficulty (which only those can appreciate who have experienced it) of discriminating the innocent from the guilty. The evil is of great magnitude and long continuance, every mode of remedy hitherto attempted having contributed to aggravate, in place of diminishing the calamity.\n\nIn this district there still exist several original Portuguese colonies, of probably more than two centuries duration, which exhibit a melancholy proof to what an extreme it is possible for Europeans to degenerate. They are a meagre, puny, imbecile race, blacker than the natives, who hold them in the utmost contempt, and designate by the appellation of Caula Ferugics, or black Europeans.\n\nBackergunge.\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, 120 miles E. from Calcutta, the capital of a district of the same name, and residence of the judge and magistrate. Lat. 22\u00b0. 42'. N. Long. 89\u00b0. 20'. E.\n\nBadar.\u2014A town in the province of Bejapoor, situated on the south side of the River Krishna, 30 miles S.

This is a place of some strength, which can be taken only by a regular siege, which would require a heavy equipment.\n\nBahdoriah, (Bhadria).\u2014A district in the province of Agra, intersected by the Chumbul River. It is principally possessed by different petty chiefs; those to the south of the Chumbul being tributary to the Maharattas.\n\nBadrachellum, (Bhadrachalam, the Sacred Mountain).\u2014A town on the N. E. side of the Godavery River, belonging to the Polooushah Rajah, 134 miles W. from Vizagapatam. Lat. 17\u00b0. 52'. N. Long. 89\u00b0. 27'. E.\n\nAt this place the Rajah of Poloonshah collects taxes upon all goods passing through his country by this road. The merchandise is generally cotton, which the Maharattas export to the northern Circars, importing from thence salt and cocoa nuts in exchange. There is a pagoda here\nof high repute, sacred to Secta; 200 yards to the south of which the town is situated, consisting of 100 huts, the whole being surrounded with jungle. (Blunt, &c.)\n\nBadroon.\u2014A town in the province of Gujrat, district of Broach, 30 miles E. by S. from Cambay. Lat. 22\u00b0. 18'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 13'.

E.\n\nBadyrcazram, (Vadaricacrama).\u2014A province in Northern Hindostan, situated betwixt the 31st and 33d degrees of north latitude. This province may be considered as the northern boundary of Hindostan in this quarter, being entirely composed of mountains, which rise one over the other, and end in the Great Himalaya Ridge. To the south it has the province of Serinagur, of which it may be considered as the northern quarter. It has never been explored, except by some Hindoo devotees, who describe it as a region of everlasting snow, containing the sources of the Ganges and other sacred rivers. The name Vadavica Asrama signifies the Bower of Vadarica Trees.\n\nBagalaen, (Bugelen).\u2014A district in the south of Java, nearly about the centre of the island, from east to west. The dialects of Scindo and of this district, are said to be very distinct from the Javanese Proper. From the Bugelen dialect the Sooloo language is supposed to be derived.\n\nBagaroo.\u2014A small town in the Rajpoot territories, in the province of Ajmeor, 12 miles S. by W. from Jeynagur. Lat. 26\u00b0. 47'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 34'. E.\n\nBaghput, (Bhagapati).\u2014A small town in the province of Delhi, 20 miles N. from the city of Delhi. Lat. 29\u00b0. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 7'. E.\n\nBaglana, (Bhagelana).\u2014A large district in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Aurungabad, situated principally betwixt the 20th and 21st degrees of north latitude. This country is exceedingly mountainous, but contains many fertile plains and valleys. Few countries have greater advantages, in point of natural strength, which is augmented by a number of strong fortresses, erected on the summits of lofty mountains. The rivers are small, and there are no towns of any great note; the chief are Chandere, Tarabad, and Ingauw.\n\nThis is one of the original Maharatta provinces, and is still wholly possessed by different leaders of that nation. On account of its natural strength, and the martial disposition of the natives, it does not appear that it ever was completely subdued, either by the Deccany sovereigns or the Moguls.\n\nThe rajahs were often reduced to the last stage of independence, particularly by Aurengzebe; but a sort of feudal obedience, and a tribute extremely irregularly paid, were the utmost subjection they ever submitted to. It was first conquered by the Mahommedans during the reign of Allah ud Deen, A.D. 1296; but it was a conquest they were unable to retain. About the year 1500 Baglana was governed by an independent rajah, who was compelled to become tributary to the Nizam Shahee dynasty of Ahmednuggur.\n\nBaglana continued under a nominal sort of subjection to the Delhi emperors, until the appearance of the Maharatta chief Sevajee, when it was amongst the first that revolted, and has ever since remained under the Maharatta government. Like many other districts subject to that nation, it is not wholly possessed by any one chief, but partitioned among several, whose limits frequently fluctuate. (Ferishta, Rennel, &c.)\n\nBagmutty, (Baghamati, Fortunate).\u2014This river has its source in the hills to the north of Catmandoo, the capital of Nepal, from whence it flows in a southerly direction, entering the British territories in the district of Tirhoot, and province of\nBahar. It subsequently falls into the Ganges, a few miles below Monghir, having performed a winding course of about 300 miles.\n\nBagnouwangie.\u2014A Dutch port and settlement situated in the Straits of Bally, at the eastern extremity of Java, and distant five leagues from the mouth of Balambonang Bay. Lat. 8\u00b0 15\u2032 S. Long. 114\u00b0 26\u2032 E.\n\nThis place is intersected by a small river, and has a little earthen fort, lined with turf, and surrounded by a ditch, over which are two drawbridges. The garrison consists of a lieutenant commandant, a company of Maduraus, intermixed with 10 Europeans, and some Samanap artillery, with a Dutch second lieutenant and sergeant. Two pilots, who reside in the village, precede the ships which pass the Straits, to point out the proper anchoring stations. In the neighbourhood are two fine plantations of pepper and coffee, with an indigo manufactory adjoining. A league beyond this place, at Sagoraday, are a large old brick-built house, a hospital, and prison for the Malays.\n\nAdjacent to this establishment is a village of the same name, consisting of 80 Chinese and Malay families, where the chief, or tomogon resides. It is separated from Panaronkan by an extensive desert; and, being one of the most unhealthy stations in the island, all the malcontents of Samarang and Sourabhaya are banished hither for five or six months, according to the degrees of their offences. All the Javan and Maduran criminals, condemned for life, are sent to work on the plantations in this vicinity. The fort and villages are surrounded by marshes, which occasion frequent putrid fevers among the natives and Europeans. (Tombe, \u00a7c.)\n\nBah (Vahu) River.\u2014This river has its source in the province of Ajmeer, not far from the city of Joudpoor, and afterwards flows in a southerly direction towards the Gulf of Cutch, which it never reaches, being absorbed by the way, or lost in the Run.\n\nBAHAR,\n\n(Vihar, a Monastery of Buddhists.)\n\nA large province of Hindostan, extending from the 22d to the 27th degrees of north latitude. It is separated from the Nepaul dominions by an extensive range of hills, which rise up on the northern frontier; on the south it has the ancient and barbarous Hindoo province of Gundwana; on the east it is bounded by the province of Bengal; and on the west by Allahabad, Oude, and Gundwana. The River Caramnassa was the old line of separation between the Bahar and Benares territories.\n\nThis province is one of the most fertile, highly cultivated, and populous, of Hindostan, in proportion to its extent of plain arable ground, which may be computed at 26,000 square miles, divided naturally into two equal portions of territory, north and south of the Ganges, which runs here an easterly course of 200 miles.\n\nOne of these divisions extends northerly 70 miles, to the forests of Nepaul and Morung; is separated from Goracpoor in Oude, on the west, by the Gunduck, and a crooked line between that river and the Dewah, or Gograh. This northern division is bounded on the east by Purneah in Bengal, the whole area being one uninterrupted flat, which was subdivided by the Emperor Akber into four districts, viz. Tirhoct, Hajypoor, Sarun, with Chumparun, or Bettiah, including four pergunnahs from Monghir.\n\nThe central division of Bahar extends south of the Ganges 60 miles, to that range of hills called in Sanscrit Vindhiya-chil, which separates the lower plains from the territory above the Ghauts. It is divided on the west from Chunar in Allahabad, by the River Caramnassa; and from Bengal, on the east, by a branch of the southern hills, extending to the pass of Tilliaghury, on the confines of Rajemal. The district named Bahar, which is in the middle of this central division, occupies about one\nhalf of the whole level area, the plains of Monghir one-sixth more, the rest being mountainous. Rotas, the most south-western district, lies chiefly between the Rivers Soane and Caramnassa; the remaining district, Shahabad, extending along the south side of the Ganges. This central division, on account of the superiority of the soil and produce, particularly of opium, yields nearly two-thirds of the total annual produce.\n\nExclusive of these two divisions there is a straggling hilly country of 8000 square miles, which produces but little.\n\nStill further to the south there is a third and elevated region, containing 18,000 square miles, though proportionally of inconsiderable value. This highland territory includes the modern subdivisions of Palamow, Ramghur, and Chuta Nagpoor; bounded on the west by the Soubah of Allahabad, on the south by Orissa, and on the east by Bengal. This last division is geographically termed the Three Bellads, or Cantons, and is also sometimes described under the appellation of Kokerah, but more commonly named Nagpoor, from the diamond mines it contains.\n\n| Square miles: |\n|----------------|\n| The assessed lands of eight districts of this province contain - - - - - - 26,287 |\n| The lands belonging to Palamow, Ramghur, and Nagpoor - - - - - - 18,553 |\n| Portion of hilly country in Monghir, Rhotas, &c. 7133 |\n| Total superficial contents of the province - - - 51,973 |\n\nIn the Institutes of Acber, compiled by Abul Fazel, A.D. 1582, this province is described as follows:\n\n\"The length of Bahar, from Gurher to Rotas, is 120 coss, and the breadth, from Tirhoot to the northern mountains, includes 110 coss. It is bounded on the east by Bengal, has Allahabad and Oude to the west, and on the north and south are large mountains. The principal rivers of this soubah are the Ganges and the Soane. The River Gunduck comes from the north, and empties itself into the Ganges near Hadijypoor. The summer months are here very hot, but the winter is temperate. The rains continue for six months. In the district of Monghir is raised a stone wall, extending from the Ganges to the mountains; and this wall is considered to be the boundary between Bengal and Bahar. This soubah contains seven districts, viz. Bahar, Monghir, Chunparun, Hajypoor, Sarun, Tirhoot, and Rotas. These are subdivided into 199 pergunnahs; the gross amount of the revenue is 55,47,985 sicca rupees. It furnishes 11,415 cavalry, 449,350 infantry, and 100 boats.\"\n\nThe province of Bahar possesses great natural advantages, a temperate climate, high and fertile soil, well watered, productive of the drier grains, and all the luxuries required by the more active inhabitants of the north. Its geographical situation is centrical, having easy communications internally, and serving as a thoroughfare for the commerce of Bengal and of foreign maritime countries, with the provinces of Hindostan. These advantages brought Bahar into a high state of prosperity soon after the Patan conquest, which continued under the Mogul dynasty.\n\nIn Bahar, and the districts contiguous to it, a parching wind from the westward prevails during a large portion of the hot season. It blows with great strength during the day, but is commonly succeeded at night by a cool breeze in the opposite direction. Sometimes it ceases for days or weeks, giving way to easterly gales. Beyond the limits of Bahar the parching winds are still more prevalent; refreshing breezes, or cooling showers of rain and hail, more rare. During the cold season a blighting frost is sometimes experienced in the Bahar and Benares provinces.\nAgriculture, manufactures, and commerce, have always greatly flourished in this province. Opium may be considered as its peculiar produce and staple commodity of the country; saltpetre is principally manufactured in the districts of Hajypoor and Sarun. Cotton cloths for exportation are manufactured everywhere, in addition to which are the ordinary productions of grain, sugar, indigo, oil, betel leaf, &c.\n\nThe manufacture of saltpetre scarcely passes the eastern limits of Bahar. It is a practical remark, that the production of nitre is greatest during the prevalence of the hot winds, which are perhaps essential to its formation. These parching winds from the west did not formerly extend beyond the eastern limits of Bahar, but by the change of seasons which have been remarked within these 30 years, the hot winds have extended their influence to Bengal Proper. Perhaps the manufacture of saltpetre might, on that account, be attempted with success in many districts of Bengal.\n\nThe actual extent of the saltpetre manufacture would admit of a production to whatever amount commerce required. What is delivered into the Company's warehouses does not usually cost more than two rupees per maund of 80lbs. the rest, after paying duty and charges of transportation, and affording profit to several intermediate dealers, sells in general at four and five rupees per maund, for internal consumption, or for traffic with different parts of India. The export of saltpetre to Europe is at all times principally confined to the Company's investment, but private persons are also occasionally permitted to export it under certain limitations.\n\nThe opium produced in the provinces of Bahar and Benares is monopolized by the government, and sold in Calcutta by public sale. For various reasons, this monopoly seems less exceptionable than many others. The common produce is eight pounds of opium per beegah (one-third of an acre), besides which the cultivator reaps about 14 pounds of seed; and many cultivators, from the same land, obtain a crop of potherbs, or some other early produce. The preparation of the raw opium is under the immediate superintendence of the Company's agent. It consists in evaporating, by exposure to the sun, the watery particles, which are replaced by oil of poppy seed, to prevent the drying of the resin. The opium is then formed into cakes, and covered with the petals of the poppy, and, when sufficiently dried, it is packed in chests, with the fragments of the capsules, from which poppy-seeds have been thrashed out. The adulteration of opium is difficult to discover; it has commonly been supposed to be vitiated with an extract from the leaves and stalk of the poppy, and with gum of the mimosa.\n\nBahar, like the greater part of Hindostan, was anciently supplied with salt from the Lake of Sambher, in the province of Ajmeer; but it now consumes the Bengal salt, and a small portion of that imported from the coast of Coromandel.\n\nIn the nature of landed property there are several distinctions between Bengal and Bahar, of which the following are the principal:\n\nIn Bengal the Zemindaries are very extensive; and that of Burdwan alone is equal in produce to three-fourths of that of Bahar, in which province the Zemindaries are comparatively small. The power and influence of the principal Zemindars in Bengal are proportionably great, and they are able to maintain a degree of independence, which the inferior Zemindars of Bahar have lost. The latter, also, having been placed under a provincial administration, from distance as well as comparative inferiority, have been precluded from that degree of information, which the Zemindars of Bengal, from their vicinity to Calcutta, and access to the officers of government, have been able to obtain.\nThe lands of Bahar have, from time immemorial, been let to farm, and no general settlement, since the acquisition of the Dewanny, had been concluded between government and the proprietors of the soil, until the final and perpetual assessment in 1792.\n\nThere are few instances of jaghires in Bengal, probably not more than three or four; but they are frequent in Bahar.\n\nThe custom of dividing the produce of the land, in certain proportions, between the cultivator and government, was almost universal in Bahar; but in Bengal this custom was very partial and limited. Upon the whole, the proprietors of the soil in Bahar were in a degraded state, comparatively with those of Bengal. In Bahar there are but three principal zemindars, viz. the Rajahs of Tirhoot, Shahabad, and Sunnate Tekaroy.\n\nThe principal rivers of Bahar are the Ganges, the Soane, the Gunduck, the Dummoodah, the Carannassa, and the Dewah; the two latter being boundary rivers: besides these there are many small streams, the flat part of this country being very well supplied with moisture. The chief towns are Patua, Monghir, Boglipoor, Ruxar, Dinapoor, Gayah, and Rotas. The race of men visibly improve in Bahar compared with Bengal, as they are taller and much more robust.\n\nBahar having been, at an early period, conquered by the Mahomedans, and afterwards retained in permanent subjection, contains a considerable proportion of inhabitants professing that religion, particularly in the northern and more cultivated districts. Although Gayah, the birthplace of Buddha, the great prophet and legislator of the more eastern nations, be within the limits of this province, and is still a place of pilgrimage for sectaries of that persuasion, yet among the resident inhabitants remarkably few Buddhists are to be found, the Brahminical being the prevailing religion.\n\nIn the remote periods of Hindoo history, Bahar appears to have been the seat of two independent sovereignties; that of Magadha, or South Bahar, and that of Mithila (Tirhoot), or North Bahar.\n\nAn intimate connexion has always subsisted between this province and Bengal, on which account their histories and political economy are unavoidably much blended; the reader is, therefore, referred to the article Bengal, for further information on these subjects, and more particularly respecting the population. (J. Grant, Abul Fazel, Colebrooke, Shore, Ghoulam, Hossein, &c.)\n\nBAHAR\u2014A large and fertile district in the province of Bahar, situated betwixt the 24th and 26th degrees of north latitude. It is bounded on the north by the Ganges, on the south by Ramgur and Monghir, on the east by Monghir, and on the west by the River Soane and the district of Rotas. This district occupies about one half of the whole level area of the district of Bahar Proper, to the south of the Ganges. In all its dimensions, according to Major Rennel, it contains 6680 square miles, besides hilly territory, dismembered from Palamow, Nagpoor, and Ramgur.\n\nIn 1582 Abul Fazel describes the district as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Bahar, containing 46 mahals, measurement 952,598 beegahs, revenue 83,196,390 dams, seyurghal 2,270,147 dams. This sircar furnishes 2115 cavalry and 67,350 infantry.\"\n\nA great proportion of this district is level and highly cultivated land; but towards the centre are some high grounds, named the Rajegur Hills, not equally fertile.\n\nAlthough extremely well watered by the Gauges, Soane, and numberless smaller rivers, this is not properly a rice country, wheat of an excellent quality being the chief produce. The other articles are opium, in very large quantities, cotton, castor oil, and saltpetre, besides all the other fruits and vegetables common to\nThroughout the district cotton goods are manufactured, and a large quantity of saltpetre is annually sent to Calcutta on the Company's account.\n\nThe culture of this district, in the vicinity of Patna, is far superior to what is generally met with in Bengal. For several miles round the villages of Bankipoor and Dinapoor, the fields assume the appearance of rich and well-dressed gardens, and the operation of watering the fields is carried on with great labour and perseverance. The surface of the ground, in this part of the province of Bahar, does not rise more than 30 feet above the level of the Ganges, and in many places the elevation is still more inconsiderable. The most common crops are cotton, dill, and the castor oil plant (the Ricinus communis). The latter rises to the height of a large shrub, and shelters below its broad leaves the dill and cotton plants. Barley alone is mixed with the common pea, is also a very common produce in this vicinity, but is not equal to that of Britain.\n\nThis district is on the whole extremely well populated, in the proportion of one Mahommedan to four Hindoos, and the cultivation of the land is rapidly extending. The chief towns are Patna, Dinapoor, Bahar, and Gayah. (J. Grant, Tennant, Colebrooke, Abdul Fazel, &c.)\n\nBahar.\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, district of Bahar, 35 miles S.E. from Patna.

E.\n\nBaharee River.\u2014This river has its source among the Jemlah mountains in northern Hindostan, from whence it flows south through the province of Oude, to the east of the Goggrah, which it joins about 25 miles above Fyzabad.\n\nBamotty, (Valundavati).\u2014A small town within the Seik territories, in the province of Lahore, situated on the east side of the Jhylam River. Lat. 32\u00b0. 7'. N. Long. 71\u00b0. 56'. E. About six miles further down formerly stood the fort of Shabat-deen, on the Island of Jamad, and to the south are salt hills. This place is about 112 miles W. N. W. from the city of Lahore.\n\nBarry, (Bari).\u2014A town in the province of Agra, situated about 10 miles to the north of the Chambul. Lat. 26\u00b0. 47'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 35'. E. This is the second town in point of consequence in the Rana of Dhelpeor's dominions. The streets are narrow, but many of the houses, which are built of red stone, are two stories high, and have a greater appearance of comfort than is usual in Indian habitations. This place has, for many years, been chiefly inhabited by Patans, and possesses several handsome Mahommedan tombs. The surrounding country is frequently harassed by depredations, and consequently ill cultivated. (Broughton, &c.)\n\nBadyanath.\u2014A village in Northern Hindostan, in the district of Kemaon, near the boundary of the Gerwal and Kemaon districts. Lat. 29\u00b0. 56'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 40'. E.\n\nThis village derives its name from a large temple, now in a ruinous condition, and no longer appropriated to sacred worship. The images, which comprehend a large proportion of the Hindu pantheon, are lodged in a smaller temple, which has the appearance of great antiquity. It stands on the banks of the Gaumathi River, in which are a number of fish, that are daily fed by the Brahmins and Fakirs. An annual festival is held at this place, during the time of the Haridwar fair, which is numerously attended by people from all parts of the hills. The village contains only eight or ten houses, inhabited principally by Gosains; but there are a few Canoje Brahmins, who have the superintendence of the temple. The Gaumathi River afterwards falls into the Goggrah, or Sarjew River. Badyanath, or Vaidyaatha, is the name of the Hindoo god of medicine. (Raper, &c.)\n\nBailura.\u2014A small town in the Rajah of Mysore's country. Lat. 12\u00b0.\n65\u00b0 N. Long. 76\u00b0 3' E. Near to this town is the small River Bhadri, the country to the west of which is called Malayar, or the Hills, while that to the east is called Meidaun, or the open country. In Malayar there are no slaves. A considerable trade is carried on betwixt Bailuru and Je-mauabad, in the Malabar province. Cochineal to the extent of about 1500 pounds weight is made here, upon the nopal raised by the farmers as a fence round their gardens. The cochineal is of the inferior kind, which has been introduced into India, and the plant is the cactus, which is aboriginal in the country. This town in Sanscrit is named Bailapura, and stands at a little distance from the Bhadri River. It has a good fort built of stone, with a suburb containing above 600 houses. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nBajulpoor.\u2014A town in the Maharatta territories, situated among the Vindaya mountains. 35 miles S. from Oojain. Lat. 22\u00b0 43' N.

Lat. 8\u00b0 N. Long. 117\u00b0 10' E.\n\nBalabalagan.\u2014A cluster of 13 small flat islands in the Straits of Macassar, covered with trees, and having navigable channels between them, but uneven anchorage. They are also named the Little Paternoster Isles. The Boadjoos fish here for sea swallo, or biche de mar, which they strike on the sand at the bottom, in eight and 10 fathoms water, with an iron pronged instrument. (Forrest, &c.)\n\nBalaghaut ceded Districts.\u2014In the south of India a stupendous wall of mountains, named the Ghauts, rises abruptly from the low country, supporting in the nature of a terrace a vast extent of level plains, which are so elevated as to affect the temperature, and render the climate cooler. This table land extends from the Krishna to the southern extremity of the Mysore, and is named Balaghaut, or Above the Ghauts, in contradistinction to Payenghaut, or Below the Ghauts. This extensive and fruitful region formed the ancient Hindoo empire of Karnata, no part of which was below the mountains, although, in modern times, the term has been so misapplied by the Mahomedans and Europeans, as to signify exclusively the country below the Ghauts.\n\nIn the present article the name Balaghaut is restricted to that territory acquired by the British government in 1800, and since subdivided into the two collectorships of Bellary and Cudapah.\n\nThis tract of country was acquired by treaty with the nizam, dated the 12th Oct. 1800, and comprehends all the territory situated south of the Toombuddra and Krishna rivers, which fell to the nizam's share by the treaties of Seringapatam in 1792, and Mysore in 1799, together with the Talook of Adoni, and all his highnesses other districts south of these rivers.\n\nThis large portion of country is what is now called the Ceded Districts; and to these, two-thirds of Punganoor were added, and part of Goodiput; having been exchanged for certain districts, which had been reserved by the treaty of Mysore, as the eventual portion of the Peshwah of the Maharattas, but which, by the supplementary treaty of Mysore, in Dec. 1803, fell into the possession of the Company.\n\nUnder the ancient native governments, this quarter of the Balaghaut was subdivided into many districts, the chief of which were Carnoul, Adoni, Commim, Harponully, Rydroog, Ballary, Gooty, Wandicotta, or Gundicotta, Cudapah, Gurrumcondah, Punganoor, and Sidhout.\n\nThe principal towns are Bijanagur, Ballary, Adoni, Gooty, Cudapah, Harponully, and Gurrumcondah.\n\nFrom the elevated surface of this region it has no large rivers except the Krishna and Toombuddra, which\nare its proper boundaries, but it possesses many smaller streams. Much the greater portion of the lands is under the dry cultivation, it being calculated, that in the Ceded Districts the wet cultivation does not exceed seven per cent. of the whole.\n\nIn the Ceded Districts there are vast tracts of land unoccupied, which may be ploughed at once, without the labour and expense of clearing away forests, as there are above three millions of acres of this kind, which were formerly cultivated, and might be retrieved and occupied.\n\nIn the ceded territories, districts are subdivided into villages under the management of potalis, or head farmers, by whom the ryots are guided. In all villages the latter are in the habit of meeting and debating on the subject of rent, but there are many villages in which they settle among themselves the exact proportion of the whole rent that each individual is to pay. These are called veespuddi, or sixteenth villages, from the land rent being divided into sixteenth shares. A great part of the Cuddapah province is composed of these sorts of villages, and they are scattered, though more thinly, over the other parts of the country. When the season of cultivation draws near, the ryots of the veespuddi villages assemble to regulate their several rents for the year. The pagoda is usually the place chosen for this purpose, from the idea that its sanctity will render their engagements with each other more binding; every village in this manner being a small collectorate, managed by the potail, or head farmer.\n\nIn 1806, after the survey of these districts was completed, instructions were circulated to make out new returns of the number of the inhabitants in every village, as far as was practicable by actual muster, except with those casts who seclude their women from public view. The total number of inhabitants amounted to 1,917,376, which showed an increase of one-fourth in the population in five years of tranquillity, partly arising from the return of persons who had emigrated during the nizam's government, but the remainder must be attributed to the falsity of former returns. These population lists tended to prove, that the males were one-tenth more numerous than the females.\n\nThe number of cattle and sheep cannot be ascertained with the same accuracy, not only because the owners are averse to giving true reports, but because herds and flocks more frequently migrate from one part of the country to another for the sake of pasture, and many herds are actually wild. The number of black cattle was estimated at 1,198,613, and that of buffaloes 493,906; the sheep 1,147,492, and the goats 694,633. The actual number of the two last is probably more, as their owners have a superstitious prejudice against their being counted by others, or even by themselves; and it is, therefore, more difficult to obtain correct statements of them than of the larger cattle.\n\nIn the Ceded Districts indigo is raised and exported in considerable quantities, the coarse sugar manufactory is also on the increase. Cotton is one of the chief productions, but has not increased lately. The peasantry are a very industrious race, and most of them husbandmen by cast.\n\nIn a political and military point of view these districts are of great value, for they are now what the Carnatic formerly was, the countries from which our armies in the Deccan must draw all their supplies of cattle and provisions. When under the nizam, the revenue of the ceded districts was rapidly declining every year. An army was constantly in the field, the expense of which consumed the collections, and the country was altogether in such a distracted state, that the nizam seemed to have given it up to the Company, because he could not retain it in subjection.\n\nThe Ceded Districts, when obtained in 1800, were placed under Colonel Thomas Munro. This extensive tract\nof country, which, including the tributary district of Karnoul, is larger than Scotland, and contains a population of above two millions, had sunk to the lowest point of declension, by a weak and improvident government. The value at which it was ceded was 16,51,545 star pagodas, including all heads of revenue. The collector, in the first instance, fixed his rents at a rate much below what had been the former demand, increasing it only as the means of the cultivator, and the state of the country, improved. In the course of seven years, the land revenues alone increased from 10,06,593 pagodas to 15,17,272; and, by the able conduct of Col. Munro, the inhabitants of the province, from disunited hordes of lawless freebooters, became as far advanced in civilization, submission to the laws, and obedience to the magistrates, as any of the subjects under the Madras government. The total collections in 1808-9 amounted to 18,02,570 star pagodas, of which 16,69,908 consisted of land revenue only.\n\nUp to 1810 no permanent settlement had been made in the Ceded Districts, but the cultivators were so far protected in the enjoyment of their property, that a fixed rent had been settled on all land, and every ryot could retain his farm, provided he paid that fixed rent.\n\nThe ceded territories are now divided into two collectorships, or districts, viz. Bellary and Cudapah.\n\nThis part of India having been brought under the Mahomedan yoke at a late period, and never thoroughly subdued or settled, the proportion of that religion to the Hindoo is small, probably not more than one in 15.\n\nIn remote times these provinces formed part of the last existing Hindoo kingdom of Bijanagur, to which article the reader is referred for some historical particulars. A great proportion of the modern polygars claim descent from the officers of the Bijanagur empire, and some from the royal family. On the fall of the Mogul dynasty it contained several small independent states, particularly the Patan Nabobs of Adoni and Cudapah, and suffered encroachments from the Curturs of the Mysore. It was mostly conquered by Hyder, between 1766 and 1780, and in 1800 was transferred to the British government. (Col. T. Munro, 5th Report, Rennel, Thackeray, Hodson, &c.)\n\nBalambangan.\u2014A small island in the Eastern Seas, about 15 miles in length, by three in breadth, lying off the northern extremity of Boruco. Lat. 7\u00b0. 15'. N. Long. 117\u00b0. 5'. E. The harbour called the North East is the largest; but at that on the south side, where the English settled, the ground is swampy. It is very convenient for watering, as by means of a hose the water may be conducted on board without landing the casks. The soil is rich and fruitful, and the harbour abounds with fish. At the north east harbour the soil is sandy and barren.\n\nIn 1774 the East India Company formed a settlement here with a view to the spice trade, but were treacherously expelled by the Sooloos in 1775, who surprised the Buggess centinels, turned the guns against the guard, and drove the settlers on board their vessels. The settlement was re-established in 1803, but afterwards abandoned. It does not appear that this settlement would have answered any purpose capable of compensating the great expenditure requisite to sustain it. The island, prior to 1774, was uninhabited, and has probably remained so ever since the British quitted it. (Forrest, &c.)\n\nBalasore, (Valeswara).\u2014A town in the province of Orissa, district of Mohurbunge, 110 miles S. W. from Calcutta. Lat. 21\u00b0. 31'. N. Long. 87\u00b0. 13'. E.\n\nThis town is built along the Booree Bellaum River, where the tide commonly rises eight feet. The stream is not navigable for vessels of greater burden than 100 tons, and even these can only get over the bar at spring\nBalasore was formerly a flourishing port, but their manufactory of Sanaes cloths is very much fallen off, both in quality and quantity. At a very early period the Portuguese, Dutch, and English, had factories here, long ago in ruins.\n\nOn the 29th Nov. 1688, during a rupture between the East India Company and Aurengzebe, Captain Heath landed a body of troops and seamen, attacked and took a battery of 30 pieces of cannon, and plundered the town of Balasore. The English factory was burned by the governor, and the Company's servants carried prisoners up the country, and it does not appear that they were ever released.\n\nThe native vessels from Balasore and Cuttaek, which carry most of the grain from Bengal to Madras, are larger and of a superior description to other native vessels employed on this coast. After having made one voyage to Madras, they usually return for a second cargo, which they generally land there in the latter end of April, or beginning of May. They afterwards proceed to Coringa, which is a favourable port, both for obtaining repairs, and cargoes of salt for Bengal.\n\nThe town of Balasore was ceded to the British government, along with this part of Orissa, by the Nagpoor Maharattas, during the administration of the Marquis Wellesley in 1803. Pilots for the Calcutta River are procured in Balasore Roads. Travelling distance from Calcutta to Balasore 141 miles S. W.

Two miles north of it is another Cooly chief's den, named Ranningpoor. The surrounding country is overspread with jungle about 15 feet high. (M'Murdo, &c.)\n\nBallary, (Bellary).\u2014The territories ceded by the nizam, in 1800, were subdivided into two collectorships\u2014Ballary and Cudapah; the former comprehending the western, and the latter the eastern districts: (See Balaghaut ceded territories.)\n\nBallary, (Valahari).\u2014A town, situated on the west side of the Hoggy River, 187 miles N. from Seriingapatam, and the capital of one of the Balaghaut collectorships, into which the ceded districts were divided. Lat. 15\u00b0. 5'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 55'. E.\n\nBallary is a hill fort, with a fortified pettah, near to which is fixed the head quarters and cantonments of a military division.\n\nThe ancestors of the Ballary polygars held the office of Dewan under the Rayeels of Annagondy, and acquired several zemindaries. His descendants paid tribute to the Beja-poor sovereigns, and afterwards to Aurengzebe. In 1775 Hyder took Ballary, when the polygar made his escape. He returned, and levied contributions in 1791, but was driven out the year following, and is since dead. With him the family became extinct, although several pretenders afterwards appeared. (T. Munro, 12 Reg. &c.)\n\nBalky, (Phalaci).\u2014A town in the nizam's territories, in the province of Beeder, 45 miles N. E. from Kalbergah. Lat. 17\u00b0. 49'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 29'. E. This is a large town, but now greatly decayed. It was formerly surrounded by a wall, with a number of round bastions, and its rajah possessed the pergunnahs of Nitone, Moorg, and Balky. It now answers the description of a large village better than that of a town. (Upton, Reg. &c.)\nBallanbouang.\u2014A district, situated in the south-eastern extremity of the Island of Java, along the Straits of Bally.\n\nA chain of high mountains commences in this district, and extend to the westward, decreasing gradually in height. This ridge divides Java longitudinally into two portions, of which the northern is the largest and the best. From these mountains many rivers descend, but none of them are navigable for large vessels; the most considerable is that of Joana.\n\nBallanbouang Bay, the entrance of which begins at Gooningikan, in the Straits of Bally, is entirely desert, and covered with thick woods down to the water's edge, and haunted by various sorts of wild beasts. The landing at Ballambouang is difficult, and the coast dangerous, particularly to the north of the river, where there is a sand bank.\n\nIn the Ballanbouang district there are some pepper and coffee plantations, but the climate is destructive, and the coast little frequented.

It was formerly two miles from Calcutta, and the road dangerous to travellers, from the number of tigers that inhabited the jungles on each side. A remarkable change has since taken place, there being an avenue of houses and gardens the whole way. Some old inhabitants, still resident in Calcutta, recollect a creek which ran from Chandpaul Ghaut to Balaghaut. They say that the drain from the government house is where it took its course, and there is a ditch to the south of the Beytakhanah, which shews evident traces of the continuation of this creek. (5th Report, &c.)\n\nBALOOCHISTAN, (Balochasthan).\n\nA large province to the west of the Indus, bounded on the north by Candahar and Seistan in Persia; on the south by the sea; on the east it has Shekarpoor and the province of Sind; and on the west, Mekran, in Persia. The space comprehended is principally situated between the 25th and 30th degrees of north latitude, and the 62d and 69th of east longitude; but the political limits of the province are in such a perpetual state of fluctuation, that it is almost impossible to define them. The names of the principal provinces are Jalawan, Sarawan, Zukree, Mekran, Lus, and Mutch; but this includes territories not subject to Mahnood Khan, the present Ameer of Kelat, the capital of the province.\n\nTo the south, Baloochistan Proper commences at Kohiuce, 25 miles N. E. from Bayla, in latitude 26\u00b0. 35', N. from which place it extends to Nooshky, 79 miles N. W. from Kelat. Lat. 30\u00b0. N. This country is described as a confused heap of mountains, through which the roads generally lead in water courses, and the beds of small rivers. Jhalawan is the most southern district of Baloochistan, and Sarawan the most northerly. They are a mass of mountains from Kohunwat, on the frontiers of Lus, to the desert which divides them from Candahar; the length of this stupendous range being 350 miles, but varying in breadth at different places. These mountains are barren, and chiefly composed of black or grey stone; but the valleys of Wudd, Khozdar, and Sohrab, are capable of cultivation. The climate of this Alpine region assimilates, in a considerable degree, to that of Europe, there being four distinct seasons\u2014spring, summer, autumn, and winter. The heat is seldom unpleasantly great, but the cold is in-\ntense during the months of December, January, and February.\n\nThe plains of Wudd, Khozdar, and Sohrab, produce favourable seasons, plentiful crops of wheat, barley, and joarec; and in some of the lesser vallies grass grows abundantly.\u2014Flocks of sheep and cattle are numerous in every part of the country. Jhalawan and Sarawan are subdivided into smaller districts, and each district into innumerable khels or societies, each of which furnish their quotas of troops according to its population, or the exigence of the service.\n\nShal and Mustung, two stages to the northward of Kelat, were given to Nassir Khan by Nadir Shah, for his services at Meshed, and Amud Dajil for those in Hindostan. The climate of Cutch Gundava is excessively hot, the winds which prevail there in the summer being often fatal even to the natives.\n\nNooshky is a small tract of about 36 square miles, at the base of the Kelat mountains. It is an arid tract, the sand hills of which are continually shifting with the winds. A small stream, called the Xysur, issues from the hills, and irrigates a small portion of the country. There are also small patches of land capable of cultivation in different parts of the sand, but which frequently become sterile for want of rain. The inhabitants of this quarter of Baloochistan dwell under black felts, stretched over a frame of wickerwork made of the guz plant; this species of village is named Tomun, or Kheil, and in most of them a few Hindoos are to be found.\n\nThe soil of this district being so sandy, the heat is excessive during the summer months, at which time the inhabitants migrate to the mountains for cool air and water, as the stream fails in the valley at that season. The inhabitants import grain from Cutch Gundava and Seistan, and dates from Mekran. The Balooches here are called Nharroes, or Rukshani, and are related to those of the same tribe in Seistan and Bunpoor. In appearance they are tall men with small bones, are extremely idle and dissolute, and addicted to thieving. They undertake predatory incursions to Mekran, and carry off into slavery any person they meet with; some they sell at Kelat and Candahar, the remainder are brought in the horde, and incorporated with the tribe. In this part of the country all the Balooches understand Persian, but they speak a dialect of the Baloochy language among themselves, different from that of the Koorgalee spoken by the Brahooces.\n\nSohrab is a fine valley extending north and south nearly 50 miles, by about 12 miles in breadth. The centre through which the water from the hills runs, is well cultivated, with small villages scattered about half a mile asunder. The mountains, in many parts of Baloochistan, are inhabited by shepherds, who reside in temporary huts erected on any spot that offers good pasturage.\n\nThere are few countries in the world so wholly without commodities suited for commercial exchange as Baloochistan, which originates partly from the dispositions of the natives, who are adverse to all the arts of civil life, and partly to the nature of the country, consisting either of stupendous mountains, or of arid plains, destitute of water or vegetation. Neither has Baloochistan the benefit of any navigable river to transport its manufactures or natural productions, if it had any; and the roads are generally nothing but the dry beds of torrents. The population is also dispersed into small societies, generally hostile to each other, and yielding but a nominal obedience to any chief.\n\nThe Baloochs and Brahooces, the two principal tribes, are subdivided into many different khels or tomuns, but their actual number has never been ascertained with any correctness. In religion they are of the Sooni sect of Mahommmedans, and strenuous adversaries of the Shiecas,\nThe following are the principal tribes of Brahooces, viz.\n\n| Tribe                  | Estimated |\n|------------------------|-----------|\n| The Kumburanee (the tribe of the Chief, Mahmood Khan) | 1000      |\n| The tribe of Mengul    | 12000     |\n| Zukree                 | 6000      |\n| Pandurani              | 6000      |\n| Nahari                 | 6000      |\n| Imoam Hosseing         | 4000      |\n| Begungje               | 1000      |\n\nThe Balooches, called Nharroe or Rukshani, inhabit that part of Baloochistan lying west of the desert, and are a tribe of 1000 fighting men, by whom the judgalls, or cultivators, have been nearly exterminated out of Northern Mekran. The few Brahooces that have settled in Mekran, are naturalized with the Brahooces of that country. In Cutch Gundava there are no Brahooces, but Balooches of the tribes of Rind and Mugree, who formerly emigrated from Mekran, and live in villages, which retain the appellation of Toomnis.\n\nThe Brahooces of Baloochistan are a strong, hardy race of men, their bones being short, and uncommonly thick. Their cast of countenance is extremely different from that of Asiatics in general, having round faces and blunt features, more like Europeans. They are hard working men, and eat voraciously of half-dressed meat and sour milk. All the Balooches are excellent workmen, but none are equal to the Brahooces in strength and courage. They train greyhounds with great care, and frequently exchange them for one or two camels, or pay 400 rupees for one when of a superior quality. Their breed of shepherds' dogs is also excellent. The broad-sword exercise and shooting at a mark are favourite amusements with the Brahooces, and as swordsmen they are said to excel. Their common dress is an under coat, which fits close to the body, and is worn over the pyrahun, or shirt; their trousers are gathered up at the ankle, and they wear a small round flat-topped cap of felt silk. The shepherds wear a covering of white felt above the shirt in winter, with cloth trousers, and a small felt cap. The Brahooces sometimes breed horses large and hardy, equally accustomed to the cold of Kelat, and the heat of Gundava, but they are often vicious.\n\nAmongst the dispersed societies of Baloochistan there are a few Hindoos scattered, who carry on the miserable traffic of the country, and act as money-changers and agents to the native chiefs. It is probable, that long after the first Mahommadan invasion, a great proportion of the country still continued in the occupation of the Hindoos; but for more than a century past the Mahommadan tribes have been so progressively increasing in barbarity, that no medium could be observed, and the native Hindoos have either undergone compulsory conversion, or deserted the country. The few who are still resident seldom bring their families, and have probably much degenerated, as travellers have not observed that they have the repugnance to flesh-meat, which characterizes most of the purer casts in India.\n\nTwo centuries ago the city of Kelat, with the surrounding country, was possessed by Sewah Rajah, a Hindoo, at which period the Balooches (as at present) tended flocks of sheep in the mountains. The inhabitants were much infested by the depredations of the people residing in the low country, lying between Kelat, Sinde, and Shekarpoor; and to protect them the rajah sent for Kumber, a Baloochy chief, and took him into his service, allowing him five bundles of grass and wood per day for each man. In the progression of time this chief increased his followers, and seizing the government, raised the tribute to 100 bundles of grass and wood daily, besides a contribution of horses, camels, and footrunners. This tribute is still occasionally exacted by the Khan of Kelat, and paid by the dehuars, or\npeasantry, in the immediate neighbourhood, who are said to have come originally from Persia, although they have much the appearance and manners of Hindoos.\n\nKumber, the first usurper, was succeeded by his son\n\nSunbar, the father of the next prince,\n\nMahommed Khan, who was succeeded by his son\n\nAbdulla Khan, the father of\n\nNassir Khan, who ascended the throne after putting to death his brother, Hajee Khan. This prince performed some important services to Nadir Shah, who rewarded him with the donation of several adjacent provinces; and, being a man of considerable abilities, greatly extended the Baloochistan dominions, which he left, in a comparatively flourishing state at his death, in 1795, to his eldest son, Mahmood Khan, who then ascended the throne. Since this period, the territories subject to Kelat have been greatly entailed by the Amirs of Sinde, and other neighbouring princes, the talents of Mahmood Khan being very inferior to those of his father. He is at present about 29 years of age, and his brother, Mustapha Khan, about one year younger. The latter is represented as being of an active martial disposition, fond of the chase, and desirous of improving the hereditary dominions, by the suppression of the numerous bands of robbers, by which the country is desolated.\n\nThe territory immediately subject to Mahmood Khan comprises the high hilly country of Sewistan, and the low lands of Cutch Gundava and Amund Dajil to the eastward, bounded on the north by Khorasan; south, by Lus and Sinde; on the west by Mekran, and on the east by Sinde. His whole clear revenue does not exceed three lacks of rupees, and is collected from Amund Dajil, Cutch Gundava, and the bazar tolls of Kelat. The Khans of Baloochistan acknowledge the paramount authority of the Kabul sovereigns, to whom they are feudatories; but their degree of obedience is in proportion to the talents of the reigning prince, and the political circumstances of the Kabul government. Upon an urgent emergency, it is supposed the territories of Mahmood Khan are capable of furnishing 25,000 infantry and cavalry, but so great a number has never yet been collected together, nor would it be easy, in so barren a country, to support them if they were. (Christie, Kinneir, &c.)\n\nBALLY, (Bali, or Little Java).\u2014An island in the Western Seas, separated from Java by the Straits of Bally, and lying betwixt the 8th and 9th degrees of south latitude. In length it may be estimated at 70 miles, by 35 the average breadth.\n\nThis island is well cultivated on the south side, and many of the lands are inclosed. It is populous, and the inhabitants spin a great deal of cotton yarn, which the Chinese export to Benoolen, as also checkered cloth. The Chinese also carry in sloops, from Bally to Benoolen, pickled pork and jerked beef, which the Malays call ding-ding. The Bugesses export cotton, both raw and spun into yarn, from this island to Celebes, packed in baskets.\n\nAt the road of Carang Assem on this island, refreshments for ships may be had; and in the Straits of Lombhook, west of Carang Assem, are several places well inhabited, named Padang, Casamba, and Tubang. The Straits of Bally are dangerous, and but seldom frequented by European vessels.\n\nThe languages spoken by the inhabitants of Bally appear to be dialects of the Javanese. The greater part of them profess the religion of their ancestors, resemble the Hindoos in their looks, wear the Hindoo mark on their forehead, and the women burn themselves with their deceased husbands, according to the practice of the Hindoos. They are peculiarly addicted to the worship of Indra, Surya, and Vishnu.\n\nAn intercourse is carried on be-\nbetween the natives of Bally and the Dutch settlement at Bagnowangie, on the opposite shore of the Straits in the Island of Java, but none are received, unless furnished with a passport written on a badamier leaf.\n\nA league and a half within the western coast of Bally, opposite to Bagnowangie, there is a volcano, which frequently discharges a shower of ashes, which cover the Dutch port and village, and all the vicinity; and to this volcano, with great injustice, settlers at Bagnowangie attribute the unhealthiness of the station. (Forrest, Leyden, Tombe, &c.)\n\nBALUMBA.\u2014A town and fortress possessed by the Rajah of Amrau, in the Gujrat Peninsula, situated on the Gulf of Cutch.\n\nBALNY.\u2014A town in the Dindigul district, 26 miles W. by N. from the town of Dindigul. Lat. 10\u00b0. 26'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 41'. E.\n\nBAMBARAH.\u2014The ruins of a city in the province of Sinde, district of Tatta. Lat. 24\u00b0. 46'. N. Long. 67\u00b0. 56'. E. The site of this place was on a hill now covered with trees and bushes, and exhibiting in the neighbourhood many tombs of Sindyan warriors, who fell here in a battle fought between Gholam Shah and Meer Ali. The ruins now perceptible at Bambarah are conjectured to be those of an ancient city, named Brahminabad by the Persian authors, which, in the 10th century, was the capital of a flourishing Hindoo principality. (Mayfield, &c.)\n\nBAMBERE.\u2014A town in the Maharrata territories, in the province of Khandesh, 70 miles E. from Surat. Lat. 21\u00b0. 18'. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 1'. E.\n\nBAMENY, (Vamanii).\u2014An island lying off the coast of Chittagong, in the province of Bengal, formed by the sediment deposited by the great River Megna, and like the adjacent islands very little elevated above the level of the water. In length it may be estimated at 12 miles, by five the average breadth. The tide runs in this vicinity with frightful rapidity, which renders the passage to and from the island extremely dangerous. The government have here an establishment for the manufacture of salt, subordinate to the Bulwah and Chittagong agency.\n\nBAMIAN, (Bamiyan).\u2014A city in Persia, the capital of the province of Bamian, which is bounded on the east by Cabul. Lat. 34\u00b0. 30'. N. Long. 66\u00b0. 57'. E.\n\nAlthough this town be situated to the west of the Hindoo Kho mountains, and appertains geographically to Persia, yet, during the reign of Acher, it was subject, with the district, to the throne of Delhi, as appears by the following description by Abul Fazel, A.D. 1582.\n\n\"In the district of Zohak Bamian is the castle of Zohak, a monument of great antiquity, which is in good condition, while the fortress of Bamian is in ruins. Tooman Zohak Bamian 861,750 dams.\"\n\nThis famous city, the Thebes of the east, is situated on the road between Bahlac and Cabul, eight days' journey from the latter place. Like Thebes of Egypt, it is entirely cut out of an insulated mountain. To the south of it, at the distance of two miles, are the ruins of an ancient city named Ghulghulch, which, according to tradition, was destroyed at a very early period by the Mahomedans. The city of Bamiyan consists of a vast number of apartments and recesses, cut out of the rock; some of which, on account of their extraordinary dimensions, are supposed to have been temples. In the Ayeen Acherberg, composed by Abul Fazel, it is said there are 12,000 of these recesses in the district of Bamian.\n\nThe attention of travellers, however, is principally attracted by two colossal statues, 50 cubits high, which are erect, and adhere to the mountain in niches. At some distance from these two is a smaller one, 15 cubits high. One of the large statues is supposed to represent a male, and one a female, and the small one their son. They are all\nmuch disfigured, and the legs of the male broken; for the Mahomedans never march that way, without firing two or three shots at them; but, owing to their want of skill, they seldom do much mischief. From the numerous fragments remaining, it would appear as if there had been many hundred statues in this district; and Prann Poory, the Hindoo ascetic, who visited this place betwixt 1770 and 1780, mentioned with admiration the number of statues that then existed, although the place had been long deserted by its inhabitants. In A.D. 1220 it was taken and destroyed by Gengis Khan. (Wilford, Duncan, Abul Fazel, &c.)\n\nBamoo.\u2014A town in the northern quarter of the Birman empire, only 20 miles from the frontiers of the province of Yunnan, in China. Lat. 24\u00b0 N. Long. 96\u00b0. 56'. E. This town and province were taken from the Chinese by the Birmans, since the accession of the present dynasty. The road from this town to Manchegee, or Yunnan, lies through mountains, and this is the usual route of the Birman envoys going to Pekin. (Symes, &c.)\n\nBamori.\u2014A small village in Northern Hindostan, containing 30 or 40 huts, situated in the district of Almora. Lat. 29\u00b0. 16'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 35'. E.\n\nThis village belongs to the Mewatis, who have formed a small colony in these forests, and levy a contribution on all goods and passengers, on their way to and from the hills. An annual fair is held here in the dry season, to which the hill people bring their merchandise for sale, or to exchange it for the productions of the low lands. Bamori is the limit of the Goorkhali territories in this quarter. (Raper, &c.)\n\nBampoor.\u2014A town in the Maharratta territories, in the province of Malwah, 33 miles S. from Kotah. Lat. 24\u00b0. 44'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 43'. E.\n\nBamragur, (Pamaraghar).\u2014A town in the province of Orissa, situated on the east side of the Brahminy Noy River, 73 miles N. W. from Cuttack. Lat. 21\u00b0. 4'. N. Long. 85\u00b0. 12'. E. A few miles to the south are iron mines and forges, which, with the town, are possessed by independent zemindars.\n\nBanass River.\u2014See Bunnass.\n\nBanaul.\u2014A small district about the 34th degree of north latitude, situated among the southern hills, in the province of Cashmere.\n\nAt the distance of five miles to the south-east of the village of Banaul, begins a boundary of a division of the Cashmere territory, lying without the greater circle of mountains. The governors of Cashmere permit the fertile valley of Banaul, which is 10 miles in length, to remain uncultivated, that it may not afford shelter or provision to the bordering Hindoo states; who, in former periods, have, through this tract, approached the interior passes of Cashmere. The Banaul district is mountainous, and looks down on the plains of Cashmere to the north. (Foster, &c.)\n\nBanaul.\u2014A town in the province of Cashmere, district of Banaul, 43 miles S. E. from the city of Cashmere. Lat. 33\u00b0. 55'. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 18'. E.\n\nBanawara.\u2014A town in the Rajah of Mysore's territories, situated on the side of a large tank, with a good mud fort. Lat. 13\u00b0. 14'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 14'. E.\n\nThis place is in a fine open country, and contains about 500 houses, many of which are inhabited by Brahmans. (F. Buchanau, &c.)\n\nBanca.\u2014An island lying off the north-eastern coast of Sumatra, from which it is separated by the Straits of Banca. In length it may be estimated at 130 miles, by 35 miles the average breadth.\n\nThe tin mines on this island are reported to have been discovered in 1710 by the burning of a house. They are worked by a Chinese colony, said to consist of 25,000 persons, under the nominal directions of the King of Palembang, but for the ac-\ncount and benefit of the Dutch Company, which endeavoured to monopolize the trade, and actually obtained two millions of pounds annually. Private merchants, English and Americans, also found means to participate in the trade. Many cargoes are yearly carried to China, where the consumption is chiefly for religious purposes. It sells there rather higher than the English grain tin, as the Chinese say it is more malleable, and on that account prefer it. Of the Banca tin sand, 133 pounds is said to yield about 75 pounds of the metal. There are seven principal places where it is dug, which are under the directions of Chinese managers, who provide and pay the miners. The latter are arrived at much perfection in reducing the ore into metal, employing wood as fuel. In former times, the profit from it to the Dutch East India Company was estimated at 150,000l., but very little was sent to Europe.\n\nAt the island the price of the tin, in a great measure, depends on the number of ships that are in want of it. Spanish dollars are the only article that can command a cargo, the sale of goods being doubtful, and ducatoons not liked. The Chinese have taught the Malays to put iron shot and stones into the middle of the slabs; it is necessary, therefore, to have them well examined.\n\nBanca is opposite to the River Palembang, in the Island of Sumatra, on which the nominal sovereign of Banca, possessor also of the territory of Palembang, resides. The island and tin mines were taken possession of by the British, in 1813. (Marsden, Staunton, Stavorinus, Elmore, Drummond, &c.)\n\nBanca, (Straits of).\u2014The island of Sumatra forms the western side, and that of Banca the eastern side of the straits. In passing through them, the coast of Sumatra may be approached somewhat closer than that of Banca. The country is covered with wood down to the water's edge, and the shores are so low, that the sea outflows the land, and washes the trunks of the trees.\n\nThe depth of water is very irregular, the water shoaling, in some spots, in one cast of the lead, from 12 to seven fathoms, and in others from seven to four. There are also coral shoals so near the surface, as to be easily distinguished by the whitened sheet of water over them. The Straits of Banca should always be entered with a favourable monsoon, according to the destination of the vessel.\n\nAt the small Nanka Isles, wood for fuel, and water of an excellent quality, may conveniently be procured. The tide in these roads rises and falls about 11 feet. It is perfectly sheltered from S. W. by S. to N. W. and there can be no high sea with any wind, as the land is but a short distance on the open points. The latitude of the Nanka Road is 2\u00b0. 22'. S. Long. 105\u00b0. 41'. E. (Staunton, King, &c.)\n\nBanca.\u2014A very small island, surrounded by a cluster of smaller, lying off the north-eastern extremity of Celebes. Lat. 1\u00b0. 50'. N. Long. 125\u00b0. E. This island has a harbour at its south end, abounds in cocoa nuts, limes, jacks, fish, turtle, and rattans, and is well inhabited. Near Banca is the Harbour of Tellusyang, called Talisse by Valentyn, at which are some wild cattle, but no inhabitants. These islands are much frequented by the piratical cruisers from Magindanao and Sooloo. (Forest, &c.)\n\nBancapoor.\u2014A district in the province of Bejapoor, possessed by different jaghiredars, the feudatories of the Maharatta Peshwa. In former times this district was frequently denominated Shahnoor Bancapoor.\n\nBancapoor.\u2014A town in the province of Bejapoor, in the Maharatta territories, 50 miles S. S. E. from Darwar. Lat. 14\u00b0. 58'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 16'. E. This is a large town, and was formerly a place of importance. The fort was dismantled by Tippoo's army, during one of his\ncampaigns against the Maharattas, at which time this was one of the chief fortifications in the Shahmoor district, and was to distinguish it from other places of the same name, called Shanoor Bancapoor. The city of Shahmoor is in sight five or six miles to the north-east. (Moore, &c.)\n\nBancapoor.\u2014A town in the Rajah of the Mysore's territories, 108 miles N.W. from Serinapatan. Lat. 13\u00b0. 38'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 45'. E.\n\nBancook.\u2014A sea port in the kingdom of Siam, situated on the east side of the Siam River. Lat. 13\u00b0. 40'. N. Long. 101\u00b0. 16'. E.\n\nThis place is properly the sea port of the city of Siam, ships of burthen seldom ascending the river higher, and it is distant from it about 42 miles. Towards the end of the 17th century, when an alliance subsisted between Louis the XIVth and the sovereign of Siam, this place was ceded to the French, who here erected a fortress, which they retained for several years. It does not appear, however, that they ever derived any essential benefit from it, as their trade with Siam was always insignificant. On the degradation and subsequent death of Constantine Faulcon, prime minister to the King of Siam, they were expelled from the country, and have never since attempted to recover their influence in it.\n\nBancoot River.\u2014A small river in the Concan province, on the west coast of India, which rises in the Western Ghaut Mountains, and falls into the sea, after a shortcourse, near to Fort Victoria.\n\nBanda.\u2014The islands of Banda, situated about 120 miles E. S. E. from Ambayna, are 10 in number, viz. Banda Neira, Goonong Assi, Banda Lantour, Pulo Ay, Pulo Rundo, Rosyngen, Pulo Pisang, Craka, Capella, and Souangy; that of Banda Neira lying in Lat. 4\u00b0. 30'. S. Long. 130\u00b0. E. being the seat of the supreme government of the whole. This island has a spacious harbour, but very difficult to be entered. Ships anchor under the cannon of two forts, named Belgica and Naussau. The rise of the tide is seven feet.\n\nThe next island is that of Lantoir, or Banda Proper, which is about eight miles in length, and, at the eastern extremity, five miles in breadth. The third and fourth isles in importance are Puloway and Pulorum. These four islands were the only places where the cultivation of the nutmeg tree was allowed by the Dutch East India Company. On the island of Rosyngen there is a redoubt, to which state prisoners were often banished, and Goonong Api has a volcano constantly emitting smoke, and often flames. Under the Dutch there were several other islands belonged to the Banda government, known by the appellation of the South Western and South Eastern Islands. Their inhabitants supplied the Dutch settlers with considerable quantities of different sorts of provisions, which they bartered for piece goods and other articles.\n\nThe Banda Isles are all high. The soil is a rich black mould, covered with trees, chiefly nutmegs. The Dutch Company were the absolute proprietors of the soil, as well as of the slaves who cultivated it. The rearing of the nutmegs being the chief object, the islands were divided into a number of plantations for that purpose, under the management of a mixed race of Europeans and Indians, either as proprietors or lessees of the spice plantations. The nutmeg grows to the size of a pear tree, and its leaves resemble the laurel.\n\nIt appears from experience that two-thirds of all nutmeg trees are barren, yet it cannot be discovered until the 12th or 14th year, so that they cannot be cut down at an earlier age. Its fruit bearing quality is of short duration, as it will only yield well from the 12th to the 20th year, and generally perishes at the age of 24 years. Each tree will produce about 10 pounds annually. From\nthe imperfect nutmegs an oil is expressed.\n\nExclusive of the provisions sent annually by the Dutch from Batavia, piece goods, cutlery, iron, and other articles of merchandise, were imported. The Burghers and Chinese merchants exported these articles to Aroo, New Guinea, Ceram, and the South West Islands. In return they received from Ceram, sago in bread and flower, and sometimes salted deer; from Aroo they imported pearls, bird nests, and tortoise shells. From these islands they also procured slaves. Cattle and grain were imported from Batavia.\n\nThe real quantity of nutmeg and mace (a membranous substance which envelopes the nutmeg) produced in the Banda Isles has never been exactly ascertained. When captured by the English, in 1796, the annual produce was about 163,000 pounds of nutmegs, and 46,000 pounds of mace; the number of inhabitants 5763. Under the old Dutch government the produce was much greater, and may again be restored to its former amount if wanted. At the peace of Amiens these islands were delivered up to the Batavian government, and were retaken by the British in 1810.

It is now possessed by an independent Goand chief. (J. Grant, &c.)\n\nBangla, (Bhangla).\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Sylhet, 34 miles E. by S. from the town of Sylhet. Lat. 24\u00b0. 51'. N. Long. 92\u00b0. 10'. E.\n\nBangaloor, (Bangaluru).\u2014A fortified town in the Rajah of Mysore's territories, founded by Hyder. Lat. 12\u00b0. 57'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 46'. E. By barometrical observations it stands 2901 feet above Madras.\n\nThe country is very naked from Catcolli to this place, about one-tenth only appearing to be arable, and not above one-twentieth of the latter is watered. The pasture is rather better than what is usually seen above the Ghauts. To the south of Bangaloor, about Kingara and Wiridy, there is a great deal of stunted copse wood abounding with tigers. The villages are poor and small, and are not fortified like the others in the country, the woods by which they are surrounded having, probably, been sufficient to keep off the irregular troops that attend Indian armies, and which consist generally of cavalry.\n\nAt Bangaloor, and the adjacent country, Indian hemp, gunny, or crotalaria juncea, is a considerable production, from which a coarse but very strong sackloth is made. Castor oil is made indifferently from either the large or the small varieties of the ricinus. It is the common lamp oil of the country, and also used in medicine.\n\nThe fort, constructed by Hyder after the best fashion of Mahommedan architecture, was destroyed by his son Tippoo, after he found how little it was fitted to resist British armies, but, in 1802, was repaired by the Dewan, Purneah.\n\nThe gardens made by Hyder and Tippoo are extensive, and divided into square plots separated by walks. The Mahommedan fashion is to have a separate piece of ground allotted for each kind of plant. Thus one plot is entirely filled with rose trees, another with pomegranates, and so forth. In this climate the cypress and vine grow luxuriantly, and the apple and the peach both produce fruit; strawberries also are raised in the\nsultan's gardens, and probably most European fruits and vegetables would, in this elevated region, arrive at perfection. Some oak and pine plants introduced from the Cape seem to thrive well.\n\nDuring Hyder's reign this city was very populous; Tippoo began its misfortunes by prohibiting trade with the dominions of Arcot and Hyderabad, because he detested the possessors of both countries. He then sent large quantities of goods which he forced the merchants to take at a high rate. These oppressions greatly injured the place, but it was still populous, and many individuals were rich, when Lord Cornwallis arrived before it, in great distress from want of provisions. This reduced him to the necessity of giving the assault immediately, and the town was consequently plundered.\n\nBelow the Western Ghauts the people of Bangalore principally trade with the inhabitants of Mangalore, named here Codeal, or Cowdal. To that place are from hence sent cotton cloths, both white and coloured, and manufactured in this neighbourhood; the returns are raw silk and silk cloths. The trade to Calicut was formerly considerable, but latterly much reduced. The chief import from the nizam and Maharattan territories is cotton wool, which is very considerable, with some coarse cotton thread; the returns from Bangalore are made chiefly in money, with some few cotton and silk cloths.\n\nThe imports from the Company's territories in the Lower Carnatic are salt, sulphur, tin, lead, zinc, copper; European steel, paints, and glue; indigo, nutmegs, cloves, camphor, and benjamin; raw silk and silk cloths; English woollen cloths, canvass, and blankets; English and native paper; English hardware, glass ware, and looking glasses; china, sugar candy, Bengal sugar, dates, and almonds.\n\nThe returns from Bangalore are chiefly betel nut, sandal wood, black pepper, true cardamoms, shicai, and tamarinds. The balance of money is generally due by the low country merchant. Tanjore merchants bring hither pearls, and take away money.\n\nBetel nut at Bangaloor is the most considerable article of trade, and next to that the country black pepper and sandal wood. Numbers of cumlies, or black blankets, are sold here. A kind of drug merchants, called Gandhaki, at Bangaloor, trade to a considerable amount. There is a great deal of salt brought from the lower Carnatic, as none but the poorest people will eat that made in the country. Goods of all sorts are transported on the backs of bullocks, which animals, when employed in carriage, are always shod with light iron shoes. The salt and grain carriers generally use asses, or a very poor sort of bullock, which gets nothing to eat except what they can pick up by the road side.\n\nThe clothes made here, being entirely for country use, and never having been exported to Europe, are made of different sizes, to adapt them to the dresses of the natives. The Hindoos seldom use tailors, but wrap round their bodies the cloth as it comes from the loom. The silk weavers make cloth of a very strong fabric, of the silk that is imported in a raw state, but which may in time be raised in the country. The introduction of the silk worm has not yet succeeded in the Lower Carnatic, but there is reason to believe the country above the Ghauts, having a more temperate climate, will be found more suitable. There is a small duty levied here on every loom, which is gradually diminished on those who keep many. At the weekly markets the cotton is bought up in small quantities by the poor women of all casts, except the Brahmans; for these never spin, nor do their husbands ever plough the soil. The women of all other casts spin, and at the weekly markets sell the thread to the weavers.\n\nAt Bangaloor there are many inhabitants of the Mahommedan religion; and, owing to the change of\ngovernment, many of them in great distress. Above the Ghauts the leprosy, in which the skin becomes white, is very common among the natives. The persons troubled with it enjoy, in every other respect, good health, and their children are like those of other people.\n\nThe only year used above the Ghauts is the Chandramanam, or lunar year, by which, among the Brahmins, all religious ceremonies are performed. At Bangaloor, the Christian era of 1800 corresponds with the year 4893 of the Cali Yug, and 1722 of Salivahanam, which is in universal use in the south of India.\n\nThis place was first acquired to the Mysore state in 1687, during the reign of Chick Deo Raj.\n\nTravelling distance from Seringapatam, 74 miles; from Madras, 215; and from Hyderabad, 352 miles.

E.\n\nBanjarmassin.\u2014A town and district on the south eastern coast of Borneo. Lat. 3\u00b0. S. Long. 114\u00b0. 55'. E. The River Banjarmassin has a shallow bar at the entrance, over which a boat cannot float, though light, until after the first quarter of the flood. In this river there is a poisonous fish or prickle, which wounds the people in the feet who attempt to drag the boats over the bar. This brings on an immediate swelling in the leg, with violent inflammation, causing shortly after delirium and death, no antidote being hitherto discovered for its cure by the natives. Ships anchoring in the Harbour of Toubanjou, or Tombornio, near the mouth of the river, can be supplied with water, and also with plenty of towels and ducks, and excellent fish, both salt and fresh.\u2014Many Chinese reside in this place and neighbourhood, from whence a considerable trade is carried on with China. The imports to Banjarmassin consist chiefly of opium, piece goods, coarse cutlery, gunpowder, small cannon, and fire arms; the exports are pepper, camphor, gold dust, wax, rattans, bird nests, biche de mar, and some spices.\n\nThe Dutch for a long time maintained a factory here for the collection of, or purchasing of pepper and rough diamonds. They used to receive 600,000 lbs. of pepper; the other articles of trade were wax, canes, and sago. Banjarmassin was of no importance to the Dutch East India Company, as they did not possess a foot of land beyond their fort, and were obliged constantly to guard against the attacks of the natives. It was originally a conquest made by Kings of Bantam in Java, which afterwards devolved to the Dutch.\n\nIn 1636 the English factors at Bantam sent a small vessel to Banjarmassin, and obtained 150,000 lbs. of pepper; and, in 1700, while the two East India Companies existed together, the English, or new Company, established a factory here.\n\nIn 1706, the English settlement at Banjarmassin consisted of one chief, four members of council, one factor, and three writers; one officer, 25\nEnglish, three Dutch, and 10 Macassar soldiers; nine European artificers, 31 Javanese carpenters, five Chinese carpenters, two Chinese bricklayers, 70 labourers, 30 slaves, and nine European seamen. In addition to this the council requested from home a large supply of military stores, and 100 Europeans, two years being required to complete the fortifications. This is an instance of the rage for multiplying settlements, which then existed, the establishment being equal in magnitude and expense to that of Calcutta, yet the trade so insignificant, and the climate so destructive, that it was soon abandoned as worse than useless. As an inducement to persevere in maintaining the settlement, the agent reported to the Court of Directors that the island yielded pepper, gold, diamonds, dragons' blood, wax, cloves, bark, and canes. Pepper was the chief article, of which it appears 1000 tons were procured annually.\n\nOn the 27th of June, 1707, the natives suddenly attacked the English settlement; and, though they were at first beat off, the loss of the English in killed was so great, that it was resolved to abandon the place. The Company's treasure was saved, but the damage sustained on shore was estimated at 50,000 dollars. This attack from the Banjarens was ascribed by the surviving settlers to the instigation of the Chinese, who were jealous of the English.\n\nBanjarmassin has always been famous for steel, which is reckoned equal to that of Europe. (Bruce, Stavorinus, &c.)\n\nBankybaazar.\u2014A small town in the province of Bengal, on the east side of the Hooghly River, 13 miles north from Calcutta. The Dutch had formerly a factory here, from which they were expelled by Aliverdi Khan.\n\nBansy, (Vansi).\u2014A town in the British territories, in the province of Oude, 44 miles N. E. from Fysabad. Lat. 29\u00b0 7'. N. Long. 82\u00b0 53'. E.\n\nBantam.\u2014A town in Java, the capital of a district, comprehending the western extremity of that island, Lat. 6\u00b0 4'. S. Long. 106\u00b0 3'. E.\n\nThe Bay of Bantam, which, in early times, was the principal rendezvous of the shipping from Europe, is so choked up with daily accessions of new earth washed down from the mountains, as well as by coral shoals extending a considerable way to the eastward, that it is inaccessible at present to vessels of burthen. With the trade of Bantam, the power of the sovereign has declined, and the king has for many years acted as a sort of viceroy for the Dutch.\n\nBantam is situated 53 miles from Batavia, and is a town of considerable extent, but only fortified on the land side. It is built wholly of bamboo, and stands on the Bay of Bantam, near the mouth of a river which falls into the bay. The king resides in a kind of palace built in the European style, within an old ruinous fort, containing 80 pieces of cannon, of all sizes, some without carriages; but the whole unserviceable. Contiguous to it is the Dutch fort, which commands that of the king as well as the city, and is in a good state of repair. The Dutch garrison here consists of a commandant, four artillery officers, and 50 Europeans, who encamp on the outside of the city, on account of its unhealthiness. The Dutch East India Company kept a garrison here nominally to defend the king from all hostile attempts; but, in fact, to have him always in the Company's power. The chief authority on the part of the Dutch East India Company was vested in a senior merchant, with the title of Commandant, who had the management of the trade, which consisted chiefly in pepper and some cotton yarn. To the commandery at Bantam also belonged the residencies at Lampong, Toulang, Baunang, and Lampong Samanca, situated on the southern part of Sumatra. The Bantam sovereigns possessed the power of life and death over their subjects, but paid an annual tribute of pepper to the Dutch, of which this state,\nwith its dependencies, furnished an annual supply of six millions of pounds. The King of Bantam was also deprived of the power of nominating his successor, the Company selecting one of the royal family for that office. On great public days the King of Bantam assumes the European costume, and dresses in an embroidered scarlet or other coloured coat, with boots, spurs, a sword, and poinard. The inhabitants of Bantam in general wear their hair loose, with a small cap, and narrow round hat without a brim.\n\nPrior to the Dutch invasion Bantam was a powerful state, the sovereigns of which had made many conquests on the neighbouring islands, particularly Sumatra and Borneo, which afterwards devolved to the Dutch. To this king's dominions also belonged all the islands in the Straits of Sunda, from Prince's Island to Pulo Baby, or Hog Island. Many of these are inhabited, but others are desert, and the resort of pirates and smugglers.\n\nSince the Dutch took possession of the adjacent province of Jacatra, and interrupted the communication with the rest of the island, the limits of Bantam have been much contracted. It still comprehends a considerable extent of territory, from the River Taganrong, two leagues from Batavia, to the western extremity of the island. Its population is considerable, and is much augmented by Maduran deserters, slaves, Chinese bankrupts, and even murderers, who take refuge within its boundaries, where the police officers of Batavia dare not pursue them, although the principality be tributary to the Dutch.\n\nIn 1595, the Dutch Commander, Houtman, with four ships arrived at Bantam, being the first Dutch squadron that had reached India. He assisted the king against the Portuguese, and obtained leave to build a factory. In Sept. 1603, Capt. Lancaster completed his cargo at this place, settled a factory, and then returned to England.\n\nIn 1674 the King of Bantam equipped ships on his own account, and sent them with produce to the coast of India, and even into the Persian Gulf. These ships were mostly manned by seamen who had deserted from the East India Company's service, and managed by some of their inferior civil servants. In 1677 Mr. White, the agent on the part of the East India Company, and the greater part of the civil servants, were massacred by the Javanese during an excursion up the river, the sultan being either ignorant of this attack, or affecting to be so. In 1681 the King of Bantam dispatched ambassadors to England, requesting assistance; but, it appears, without success; for, in 1682, Bantam was taken by the Dutch, they having assisted the king's son to expel his father. In 1683 they dethroned the son, and assumed the trade and government of Bantam and its dependencies; upon which event the English East India Company's establishment quitted the place, and retired to Surat.\n\nThe climate of Bantam is still more pestilential than that of Batavia, of which a remarkable instance is mentioned. On the night of the 18th March, 1804, the King of Bantam was murdered by one of his grand nephews, who had concealed himself under his bed, and who was afterwards discovered, and put to death. An embassy was sent from Batavia, to elect and instal the new king in the name of the Dutch Company, part of which ceremony consists in having him weighed in a pair of scales at the palace gate, after having feasted for 15 days. This deputation was composed of a counsellor of India, four senior merchants, a major, lieutenant, serjeant, two corporals, 18 French and 18 Dutch grenadiers. The external forms occupied 15 days; at the end of which time, or soon after their return, the whole of the European grenadiers and subalterns died, except two or three of the French who escaped. The counsellor, his wife, who had\naccompanied him, the major, and four merchants, all returned with putrid fevers, which brought them to the brink of the grave, and the secretary died. In 1811, after the conquest of Batavia, the town and district of Bantam surrendered to the British arms without resistance. (Stavorinus, Tombe, Bruce, Staunton, Quarterly Review, &c.)\n\nBar.\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, district of Bahar, 35 miles E. S. E. of Patna. Lat. 25\u00b0. 28'. N. Long. 85\u00b0. 46'. E.\n\nBarrabutter.\u2014A fortress in the province of Cuttack, about a mile N. W. from the town of Cuttack, built of stone, and surrounded by a very broad ditch, filled from the Mahanuddy River. This was the strongest fortress possessed by the Maharrattas in the province, but was taken by storm by the British forces on the 14th Oct. 1803, and was ceded at the peace along with the surrounding country. (Leckie, Upton, &c.)\n\nBarahat.\u2014A town in northern Hindostan, situated among the mountains in the province of Serinagur. Lat. 30\u00b0. 48'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 29'. E.\n\nThe houses of this town are built of large stones, with a slated roof, and suffered greatly by an earthquake in 1803, which almost destroyed it. Barahat is the capital of a Talook of the Rowain, and originally acquired its name from being the chief mart of 12 villages. Its central position enables it to maintain a free communication with all parts of the hills, and pilgrims going to Gangotri in general halt here, and lay in a stock of provisions for 10 or 14 days, as there are no intermediate villages where they could be certain of procuring supplies. The only article brought from any distance is salt from Bootan, but the quantity is small. The distance from hence to Gangotri is seven days journey, to Jamantri five, to Kidarnauth 12, and to Serinagur six; but, excepting to the latter place, the roads are very bad and difficult.\n\nNear this village is a curious trident, the pedestal of which is made of copper, the shaft of brass about 12 feet long, and the forks of the trident about six feet long. By what means it came hither has never been discovered, and although the inscription is legible, it is said to be neither Nagari, Persian, nor Sanscrit. There was formerly a temple over it, which was thrown down by the great earthquake in 1803, (Roper, &c.)\n\nBaraiache, (Bharee).\u2014A district in the province of Oude, extending along the north side of the Dewah, or Goggrah River, and separated from the dominions of Nepaul by a ridge of lofty hills. Some part of this district was ceded to the British government in 1800, but a great proportion of it still remains in the possession of the Nabob of Oude. The northern part is very hilly, and covered with forests, but towards the Dewah, on the south, it is more level and fertile. The Dewah and Baharee are the principal rivers, and the chief towns Baraiache and Bulhrampoor.\n\nIn 1582 this district is described by Abul Fazel as follows:\u2014\"Sircar Barayitche, containing 11 mahals, measurement 1,823,435 beegahs, revenue 24,120,525 dams. Seyurghal 466,482 dams. This Sircar furnishes 1,170 cavalry, and 14,300 infantry.\"\n\nBaraiache.\u2014A town in the Nabob of Oude's territories, district of Baraiache, of which it is the capital. Lat. 27\u00b0. 31'. N. Long. 81\u00b0. 36'. E. It is described by Abul Fazel as follows:\u2014\"Baraiache is a large city, delightfully situated on the River Sy. Sultan Massaood, and Rejeb Sillar, are both buried here, and held in great veneration.\"\n\nBaran River.\u2014This river has its source in the Hindoo Kho mountains, from whence it flows in an easterly direction through the N. I. quarter of the province of Cabul, and afterwards joins the Chuganserai River in the district of Kaneeh. Their united streams afterwards fall into the Cabul, or Attock River.\n\nBarbareen.\u2014A small village on the S. W. coast of Ceylon, with a sort of harbour formed by a projec-\ntion of land, where the river runs into the sea. Lat. 6\u00b0. 35'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 55'. E.\n\nThis is almost the only part on the coast where the high surf and rocky shore permits ships' boats, of the European construction, to land. There is a manufactory here for making cordage from the fibres of the cocoa nut husk. A few miles farther south the best oysters on the island are found, which are of a different sort from the pearl oysters at Manaar. Barbareen is a Mahommedan village, and the Modeliar, or chief, is also a Mahommedan. The inhabitants are chiefly artisans, who besides the rope manufactory, work in all kinds of metal, and make swords, poignards, and thin scabbard of good workmanship. (Percival, M. Graham, &c.)\n\nBarcelore.(Bassamuru).\u2014A town on the sea coast in the province of Canara, Lat. 13\u00b0. 37'. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 46'. E. This place was probably the port Barace of the ancients. In 1575 Barcelore was governed by a female sovereign, or ranny, the daughters always succeeding to the government, and the men serving under them as officers. A considerable trade formerly subsisted between this station and the Arabian coast.\n\nBareily, (Barali).\u2014A district in the province of Delhi, situated principally betwixt the 28th and 29th degrees of north latitude. In the Institutes of Acber it was comprehended in the Sircar of Budayoon, and described under that name, but the original appellation of a great proportion of the country prior to the Rohillah conquest was Kuthair; subsequent to this latter event it was incorporated with the province of Rohilcund.\n\nThe surface of this district is, in general, level and well watered by many smaller rivers besides the Ganges, which bounds it to the west. The chief towns are Bareily, Anopsheher, Rampoor, and Budayoon. In summer, notwithstanding its northern latitude, the heat is very intense; but during the winter months, when the wind blows from the northern mountains, the thermometer falls below 30\u00b0, and water in the tents freezes.\n\nAfter the conquest of Rohilcund, in 1774, by Sujah ud Dowlah, assisted by the British troops, it rapidly declined, and became almost a waste. Betwixt Anopsheher and Bareily extensive wastes, formerly under cultivation, everywhere meet the eye. They are covered with long grass, which, in the hot season, becomes so parched as to be easily combustible; and abounds with foxes, jackalls, hogs, hares, and every sort of game, which range these wide plains unmolested.\n\nIn 1802 this large district was ceded to the British government, when it was subdivided into collectorships, and a general court of appeal and circuit appointed to administer justice. At this time their internal situation was very unpromising, and the inhabitants greatly impoverished. Since then, travellers who have visited this territory, mention the general state of prosperity and improved cultivation which it now exhibits, compared with its desolate appearance when ceded to the Company. On this event fairs were instituted by Lord Wellesley upon the borders of the Rohilcund country, for barter with the people of Nepaul and Serinagur.\n\nIn this division of Rohilcund there are few Hindoo temples to be found of any considerable magnitude. The zeal of the Mahommedans appears to have been too intolerant, and their possession too permanent to permit them. The natives are a tall handsome race of people, and when compared with the more southern inhabitants of India, are white and well featured.\n\nRohilcund Furruckabad, and the upper part of the Doab, abound with a warlike race of Mahommedans ready to join any leader. Some thousands of this description served under Holkar, and many are now\nwith their countryman Ameer Khan. They are disaffected to the British government, not because it is unjust or oppressive, but because there is no employment for them, and they are left inactive, without distinction and without subsistence. Few of these people enlist in the British service, because they cannot bring themselves to submit to the strictness of European discipline. These Patans are, in general, reduced to much distress; they are idle, and with difficulty and reluctance apply to any profession but that of arms. Amongst them the influence of a rebellious or disaffected chief over his followers is very great, and is not founded in the popularity or supposed justice of his cause, and very little on the probability of his success. Though he be a mere robber, and his situation quite desperate, still his people will adhere to him to the last, and never betray or forsake him.\n\nThe Bareilly division of the court of circuit comprehends the following districts, viz. 1. Caupoor; 2. Furruckabad; 3. Etaweh; 4. Agra; 5. Allyghur; 6. South Saharunpoor; 7. Moradabad; 8. Bareily.\n\nThe Mahommedan inhabitants of this district approach nearer to an equality of numbers with the Hindoos than in most of the others of Hindostan, but still are considerably inferior. (Tennant, H. Strachey, 5th Report, Foster, &c.)\n\nBareily.\u2014A town in the province of Delhi, district of Bareily, of which it is the capital; and, at present, of Rohileund generally. Lat. 28\u00b0. 22'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 21'. E.\n\nThis town is situated on the banks of the united streams of the Jooah and Sunkra, about 40 miles from the Ganges, and is a large and populous city. The fort is a great irregular mass of building, equally destitute of elegance or strength, and without bastions for guns. Brazen water pots are manufactured here in great numbers. This was the capital of Hafez Rahmut, a Rohillah chief, slain at the battle of Cutterah, and here he lies interred. In 1774 it was, along with the district, added to the dominions of Oude; and, in 1802, transferred to the British.\n\nTravelling distance from Delhi 142 miles; from Calcutta, by Moorshe-dabad, 910; by Birbhoom, 805 miles; from Lucknow, 156 miles.

The 12 places properly constituting the Barramahal are all in Dravida Desam, which is bounded on the west by the Ghauts, and on the east by the sea. These 12 places are Krishnagiri, Jacadeo, Varinaghadha, Maharay-ghada, Bujungaghadha, Tripatara, Vanambady, Gangana-ghada, Sudarshana-ghada, and Tatuallu.\n\nAfter the fall of Seringapatam, in 1799, several districts of Karnata were annexed to this province; viz. the talooks of Denkina Cotay, Hosso-uru, Kellamangalum, Ratnagiri, Vin-catagiri, Cotay, and that portion of the Allumbady Talook which lies to the left of the Cavery, together with the Polyams, or feudatory lordships of Punganuru, Pedda, Nayakana, Durga, Bagaluru, Suligiri, and Ankusagiri. All the polygars were restored to their estates, and put on a footing similar to that of the zemindars in Bengal. They pay a fixed rent or tribute for their lordships, but have no jurisdiction over the inhabitants.\n\nIn these annexed districts the natives of the Barramahal will not settle, on account of the coldness of the climate during the rainy season. A considerable proportion of the land remains uncultivated. In the annexed districts the rice cultivation is not important; dry seeds, kitchen gardens, and plantations of coconuts, and Areca palms, are the chief articles cultivated, and the manufactures are coarse, and only fitted for the lower classes. In the districts annexed to the Barramahal, the property of the soil is vested in the state, except in the Polyams, and a few small free estates. When a rich man undertakes to construct a reservoir, at his own expense, for the irrigation of land, he is allowed to hold in free estate, and by hereditary right, one fourth part of the lands so watered; but he is bound to keep the reservoir in repair. Tanks of this sort are notoriously kept in better repair than those which the government supports. The reason assigned by the natives is, that they can compel the holder of the free estate to perform his duty, but the state has no master. It would therefore seem advisable to give rich natives every encouragement to employ their money this way.\n\nOn the fall of the Rayaroo of Anngoondy, the Baramahal, with Rayacottah, and many other districts, became subject to Jagadeva, the polygar of Chenapattans. On the overthrow of this family, its territories were divided between the Nabob of Cudapah, and the Rajahs of Mysore. The former took the Barramahal, and the latter the dominions of the Chenapattan family. Hyder annexed the Barramahal to the dominions of Mysore; and, in 1792, it was ceded to the British government at the treaty of Seringapatam.\n\nWhen ceded, the country was in a very miserable state; but the good effects of a just and moderate government were soon exhibited, while it was under the superintendence of Colonel Alexander Read. In the course of five years the revenues were more than doubled, while the rents were diminished in an equal proportion; and since the introduction of the permanent system, this district has attained a still higher degree of cultivation. It is now comprised in the collectorship of Salem and Kistnagerry.\n\nThis district contains a very great proportion of Hindoo inhabitants, probably at least 19-20ths, it never having been subdued by the Mahomedans, until its conquest by the Nabob of Cudapah, about the middle of the 18th century. (F. Buchanan, Sydenham, T. Muir, 5th Report, &c.)\nBarrah Tuckrah.\u2014The districts of Hundah and Cowrah, in the northern extremity of the province of Delhi, are denominated the Barrah Tuckrah, or Twelve Divisions, being certain portions of territory bequeathed by a chief of Bellaspoor to his younger son, about 110 years ago. They now belong to the chief of Bellaspoor. (Foster, &c.)\n\nBarreah.\u2014A town in the province of Gujrat, district of Gudarah, 90 miles E. from Ahmedabad. Lat. 22\u00b0. 58'. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 3'. E. It is now held by a rajah, tributary to the Gwickar.\n\nBarren Isle.\u2014An island and volcano in the Bay of Bengal, situated in Lat. 12\u00b0. 15'. N. and 15 leagues E. of the northernmost Andaman. This island rises to the height of 1800 feet. The eruptions of the volcanos are sometimes very violent; stones of the weight of three or four tons have been known to be discharged from it. The parts of the island that are distant from the volcano are thinly covered with withered shrubs and blasted trees. (Col. Colebrook, &c.)\n\nBaroos.\u2014A town on the west coast of Sumatra. The inhabitants here have benzoin and gold, and procure camphire from the interior. The imports are the same as specified under the article Sinkel; to which may be added white beads, plicat handkerchiefs, chintzes, with large flowers and grounds, white Dungaric, salt, rice, ghce, oil, a few metal watches, and gilt hilted swords. (Elmore, &c.)\n\nBarwah.\u2014A village in Bundelcund, 67 miles W. N. W. from Chatterpoor, so called from a rivulet named the Berwa, which runs past it, and by an embankment is made to form a large pond (in Hindi called Sagor,) at the back of the fort. Lat. 25\u00b0. 24'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 55'. E. The castle very much resembles an old Gothic building, and was erected by the ancient rajahs of Onncha.\n\nIn 1790 the Hindoo Sonbahdar, of this district, was an uncommonly accomplished person, and had acquired a very considerable knowledge of European sciences. At the advanced age of 60 he had formed the project of studying the English language, in order to comprehend the Encyclopedia Britannica, of which he had acquired a copy. Such, however, is the inconsistency of human nature, and the strength with which Hindoo prejudices adhere, that, about five years afterwards, having been seized with some complaint, which he considered as incurable, he repaired to Benares, and there drowned himself in the Ganges. (Hunter, &c.)\n\nBary, (Bari).\u2014A town in the Nabob of Onde's territories, in the province of Oude, 28 miles N. from Lucknow. Lat. 27\u00b0. 15. N. Long. 80\u00b0. 52'. E.\n\nBasoudha, (Vasudha).\u2014A town in the province of Malwah, 46 miles N. E. from Bilsah, situated on the east side of the River Betwah. Lat. 23\u00b0. 54'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 13'. E. This is a large town belonging to the district of Bilsah, and tributary to the Maharattas. The soil in the neighbourhood is alternately a black mould and a reddish clay, with stones of a ferruginous appearance. (Hunter, &c.)\n\nBasseen.\u2014A sea port town in the province of Aurungabad, separated from the Island of Salsette by a narrow strait. Lat. 19\u00b0. 18. N. Long. 72\u00b0. 54'. E.\n\nThe district around this town is in a very improved state of cultivation, although under a Maharatta government, and forms a most extraordinary contrast with the desolation that prevails in the neighbouring Island of Salsette, under the British government. Many of the cultivators are Roman Catholic Christians. The Teak forests, which supply the marine yard at Bombay, lie along the western side of the Ghaut mountains, to the N. and N. E. of Basseen, the numerous rivers which descend from them affording water carriage.\nIn 1531 the Portuguese obtained possession of Basseeen, by treaty with the King of Cambay; after which they fortified it. From them it was wrested, about 1750, by the Mahrattas. It was taken by General Goddard's army, from the Maharattas, but restored at the peace, and now belongs to the Peshwa. Travelling distance from Bombay, 27; from Poonah 114 miles. (Malcolm, Rennef, Bruce, Sydenham, Malet, &c.)\n\n**Bashee Isles.**\u2014A cluster of small rocky islands, lying due north of Luzon, the largest Philippine, and between the 20th and 21st degrees of north latitude.\n\nThese islands are situated between Formosa and Luconia, and are five in number, besides four small rocky islets. Dampier gave the following names to the five larger of them, viz. Grafton Isle, Monmouth Isle, Great Isle, Orange Isle, and Bashee Isle. They are inhabited by a race of strong athletic men. Grafton Isle is about 13 leagues in circumference, and has good anchorage on the western side. This island produces abundance of fine yams, sugar cane, taro, plantains, and vegetables; besides hogs and goats in great plenty. Iron is the favourite article of exchange, but money is also now understood. The water on the island is very fine, and in great abundance, close to the beach.\n\nThe Spaniards took possession of these islands in 1783, in order to procure the gold which is washed down with the torrents in considerable quantities. The inhabitants manufacture it into thick wire, which they wear as an ornament. They are an inoffensive race of people, whose chief delight consists in drinking a liquor called bashee, which is distilled from rice and sugar-cane; after which they engage in dancing with every mark of satisfaction and gratification.\n\nThe Spanish governor resides on Grafton Island, with about 100 soldiers, several officers, a few priests, and six pieces of cannon.\n\nThese islands were visited by Dampier, who gives a favourable account, both of the civility of the inhabitants, and the plenty of hogs and vegetables with which the country abounds. They were afterwards seen by Byron and Wallis, who passed without landing. (Mearns, King, &c.)\n\n**Basheelan.**\u2014An island lying off the south-western extremity of Magindanao, and surrounded by a cluster of smaller islands. In length it may be estimated at 40 miles, by 60 miles the average breadth. This island has a range of mountains in the centre, but is low towards the east. It is thinly inhabited, and destitute of good harbours. The chief production is grain, which the soil yields plentifully; cowries also are abundant. It now belongs to the Sooloos. (Forrest, Dalrymple, &c.)\n\n**Bassum, (Basam).**\u2014A district in the nizam's dominions, in the province of Nandere; situated betwixt the 21st and 22d degrees of north latitude. It has an uneven hilly surface, intersected by several small streams, which flow into the Godavary. Bassam, the chief town, is situated six miles from the Gunga. Respecting this part of Nandere very little is known: in the Institutes of Acheer, Abul Fazel describes it as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Bassum, containing eight mahals; revenue 32,625,250 dams; seyurghal 1,825,250 dams.\"\n\n**Batang.**\u2014An island lying off the south-eastern extremity of the Malay Peninsula, and surrounded by numberless small rocky islets. It is separated from the Island of Bintang by a narrow strait, and may be estimated at 25 miles in length, by 10 miles the average breadth.\n\n**Batacolo.**\u2014A small fort and garrison on the east coast of the Island of Ceylon. Lat. 7\u00b0. 45'. N. Long. 81\u00b0. 50'. E. Owing to the wild state of the country, this place has little or no connexion with the south and west parts of the island, and is a place of small importance, the har-\nBATAVIA.\n\nbour only admitting small craft. The shore in the neighbourhood is uncommonly bold; and many of the immense rocks have acquired names from the grotesque figures they represent; such are the Friar's Hood, the Elephant, and the Pagoda Rocks. (Percival, &c.)\n\nBatalin.\u2014An island situated off the coast of Celebes, about the 124th degree of east longitude, and betwixt the first and second degree of south latitude. In length it may be estimated at 25 miles, by seven the average breadth. Very little is known respecting this island, which appears never to have been explored.\n\nBatang, (or Patany Hook).\u2014A port in the Gilolo passage, situated on the east coast of Cilolo. Lat. 0\u00b0. 9'. S. Long. 128\u00b0. 48'. E.\n\nOn Patany Hook, or Point, is a very strong and capacious natural fortress, accessible only by means of ladders, up the face of a perpendicular rock. The top is flat ground, containing many houses, gardens, &c., the whole being about three miles in circumference. The people here, in 1770, supplied the French vessels with clove plants, which went no further east than the Island of Gibby. Formerly the Dutch kept cruisers here, to prevent the smuggling of spices. (Forrest, &c.)\n\nBatavia.\u2014A large city in the Island of Java, and the capital of the Dutch settlements in the east. Lat. 6\u00b0. 10'. S. Long. 106\u00b0. 51'. E.\n\nThe ground plan of the town is in the shape of a parallelogram; the length of which, from north to south, is 4200 feet, and the breadth 3000 feet. The streets are laid out in straight lines, and cross each other at right angles. The public buildings consist of the great church, the expense of erecting which was 80,000l. A Lutheran and Portuguese church, a Mahommedan mosque and Chinese temple; the Stadthouse, the Spinhouse, the Infirmary, and the Chamber of Orphans. In the year 1792 Batavia contained 5270 taxable houses, which, added to villages and villas within a circuit of 10 miles, contained a population of about 116,000 souls, consisting of\n\n| Description                  | Number |\n|------------------------------|--------|\n| The Dutch E. I. Company's servants of every description | 3300   |\n| Burghers, or free citizens    | 5660   |\n| Javanese and free Malays      | 6800   |\n| Chinese                       | 2,2000 |\n| Slaves                        | 17,000 |\n\nTotal - 115,960\n\nThe total population of the government, immediately subordinate to the city of Batavia, is reckoned at 150,000 souls.\n\nBesides the walls of the city, composed of well-built bastions, enclosed by a wet ditch, very deep and wide, there is a good citadel, with four bastions, also of stone. This citadel commands the city, and defends the entrance of the River Jacatra, which, flowing through Batavia, fills its ditches and those of the citadel. On the extremity of the left bank is a fort called Watercastle, which is washed by the sea. Its platforms are of stone, and the parapets are well covered with turf, and it contains thirty 16 and 24 pounders. This fort is flanked by batteries, raised on the right and left bank, in front of the citadel and fortifications.\n\nThe left wing is defended by four works, viz. a redoubt called the Flute, above the mouth of the Aneka River, which it commands; a very fine causeway communicates with it, extending to the city walls. There are many other redoubts and batteries scattered along the shore, and erected at assailable points, which it is unnecessary to particularize, as they contribute little or nothing to the defence of the town, and when attacked, in 1811, by the troops under Sir Samuel Achmuty, were abandoned without resistance. This left wing is so sickly, owing to the morasses in which it is placed, and their pestilential exhalations, that the\nmortality among the soldiers who garrison it is almost incredible, and the country houses, which formerly stood in its vicinity, have long ago been deserted. All the plain which forms the defence is composed of muddy impracticable swamps, which extend beyond the city, and are intersected by canals.\n\nThe whole city of Batavia is proverbially unhealthy, not so much from the heat of the climate, as from its injudicious situation and misplaced embellishments. It is not only surrounded with water nearly stagnant, but every street has its canal and row of evergreen trees. These canals become the reservoirs of all the offals and filth which the city produces; and, having scarcely any current, require constant labour and attention to prevent their being choked up altogether. On the land side of the city are gardens and rice grounds, intersected in every direction by ditches and canals, and the whole shore of the bay is a bank of mud, mixed with putrid substances, sea weed, and other vegetable matter, in a state of fermentation. To these swamps, morasses, and mud-banks, may be ascribed the insalubrity of Batavia, and the prevalence of acute inflammatory febrile diseases.\n\nAt the mouth of the Aneka, called by the natives Caiman's River, because it abounds with alligators, the bottom is mud and sand, as is also the bank which has accumulated at its mouth; but at Slingerland Point the bottom begins, on the coast, to be a mixture of sand and coral, with occasionally small shells; and, being consequently less unhealthy, country seats, small villages, and hamlets, are seen in the vicinity.\n\nIn a place so low and marshy the number of noxious reptiles must be considerable, but not much damage is ever sustained from them. No stone of any kind is found for several miles round the city of Batavia; marble and granite, for particular uses, are imported from China. The usual temperature, in the middle of the day, is from 84 to 90; it is not, therefore, to the great heat, that must be ascribed the destructive effects of the climate on the human race.\n\nA circular range of islands protects the harbour of Batavia from any heavy swell, and renders it safe anchorage; some of them, such as Anrust, Edam, Cooper's Isle, and Purnerend, are occupied by the Dutch, who have fortified them, and erected warehouses, hospitals, and naval arsenals. From the roadsted there are scarcely any of the buildings of Batavia visible, except the great church, the rest being hid by the palms and other high spreading trees.\n\nOn that side of the city which is inland, the industrious Chinese carry on their various manufactures, such as tanning leather, burning shells into lime, baking earthen ware, boiling sugar, and distilling arrack. Their rice grounds, sugar plantations and gardens, well stocked with all kinds of vegetables, surround the city, which abounds in all sorts of tropical fruit; pine apples are in such profusion, that they are sent to the market in carts, piled up like turnips.\n\nIn the town the Chinese are merchants and shopkeepers, butchers and fishmongers, green grocers, upholsterers, tailors, shoe-makers, masons, carpenters, and blacksmiths. They contract for the supply of whatever may be wanted in the civil, military, or marine departments, and farm from the Dutch the several imposts, the export and import duties, and the taxes. Their campong, or town, close to the walls of the city, is a scene of bustle and business, resembling a bazar in China. It consists of about 1500 mean houses, huddled together, containing 20,000 inhabitants and 400,000 swine.\n\nThe commerce of Batavia is considerable; but it is principally a trade of barter, the exportation of bullion being prohibited. When a\nvessel arrives, the captain incloses his bill of lading to the shabbunder, who selects the articles, the exclusive trade in which is reserved for the East-India Company; such as opium, camphor, benzoin, calin, pewter, iron, saltpetre, gunpowder, guns, &c. and fixes on what is to be given in exchange, and at what price. Formerly the Dutch Company insisted, that one quarter, or one third of all the returns should be taken in spices.\n\nFrom Bengal the principal articles imported are opium, drugs, patna cloths, and blue cloths, of different kinds. Of the first article there were formerly from 800 to 1000 chests disposed of here. From Sumatra are received camphor, benzoin, bird nests, calin, and elephants' teeth. From the Cape of Good Hope are imported kitchen garden seeds, butter, Madeira and Constantia wines; and from China immense quantities of porcelain, teas, silks, naukeens, alum borax, brimstone, cinnabar, mother of pearl, paper, sweetmeats, and tobacco.\n\nThe Dutch being the only nation who keep up a correspondence with Japan, a ship is sent annually from Batavia, laden with kerseymeres, fine cloths, clock-work, spices, elephants' teeth, sapan wood, tin, and tortoise-shell. The returns from Japan are principally in copper, which is converted into a clumsy sort of coin for paying the native and European troops. These ingots are of the finest red copper, about a finger's thickness, and are cast into two, four, six, and eight sous pieces of Holland, having the value stamped on them. Various other articles are smuggled in by the officers, such as sabre blades of an excellent temper, Japan camphor, soy, china ware, lacquered ware, and silk goods. The cargo always contains a present for the Emperor of Japan, and he, in return, sends one to the Governor-General of the Dutch possessions in India. It consists in general of desks, chests of drawers, and close stools of valuable inlaid wood, covered with a varnish peculiar to Japan, and incrusted with flowers, and other designs, in mother-of-pearl of various colours.\n\nThe staple articles of export from Batavia are pepper, sugar, rice, coffee, and arrack. The Chinese sanchoo (or burned wine) is an ardent spirit, distilled from various kinds of grain, but most commonly rice. This is kept in hot water until the grains are swollen; it is then mixed up with water, in which a preparation has been dissolved, consisting of rice-flower, liquorice root, aniseed, and garlic, after which the mixture undergoes fermentation. The liquor thus prepared is the basis of the best arrack, which in Java is exclusively the manufacture of the Chinese, and is merely a rectification of the above spirit, with the addition of molasses and the juice of the cocoa nut tree. Besides the staple articles, there are exported to China bird nests, biche de mar, cotton, spices, tin, rattans, sapan wood, sago, and wax. To the Islands of Borneo, Celebes, the Moluccas, &c., a variety of piece goods and opium, with a very small quantity of European articles. All the Dutch settlements to the eastward are supplied with rice from hence, Java being considered as the granary of this part of the world. In Batavia there are few shops for European goods, which proves there is no great demand from the interior.\n\nThe customs and duties at Batavia are arbitrary, and it is difficult to procure redress for impositions. The Dutch Company's customs are usually eight per cent, and are farmed by a Chinese; but there are many other fees exacted by the different subordinate officers. The exportation of specie is rigidly forbidden, and all ships are strictly examined by the Chinese who farms the customs. If any bullion be discovered it is confiscated, and the owners subjected to fine and imprisonment. The grand import of the Dutch East India Company from Europe before the French\nRevolution was bullion, which averaged in amount near half a million annually; the remaining imports were principally on account of the officers of ships, and consisted of hardware, haberdashery, liquors, oilman's stores, dress, and millinery, for the use of the Europeans on the island, and among the more eastern colonies. Accounts at Batavia are kept in rix dollars, an imaginary coin like the pound sterling, each 48 stivers; but the currency is doit, stivers, dubbeltees, schillings, and rupees. The gold coins are the milled Dutch ducat, worth 9s. 4d.; old Japan copang, 2l. 1s. 3d.; new Japan copang, ll. 3s. 9d.; English guineas, East India mohurs, and doubloons. The silver coins are the florin, or guilder, value 1s. 8d. and the milled ducatoon.\n\nThe administration of affairs at Batavia is conducted by a governor-general, who is president; a director-general, intitled Governor of Java, with nine counsellors, and two secretaries. The authority of this council is absolute: it makes and suspends laws, maintains troops, appoints kings, declares war, and makes peace and alliances with the eastern princes. It takes cognizance of all matters, commercial, civil, and military. The whole authority of the council may be considered as united in the governor-general who presides, as he may adopt, on his own responsibility, any propositions which are rejected contrary to his opinion by the council.\n\nA fiscal is at the head of police and criminal affairs, and possesses great authority. He inflicts fines and punishments arbitrarily. A shahbunder, or agent-general for trade, acts as consul for all nations, is the medium of every operation of trade, and introduces foreigners to the council. A marine fiscal superintends whatever relates to the police of the roadsteads, rivers, and navigable canals.\n\nNotwithstanding the republican form of the Dutch government, in no part of the world is the distinction of ranks so minutely and frivolously attended to as at Batavia, and the salaries allowed the Dutch Company's servants, being inadequate to the support of the establishment, they think necessary, for the support of their dignity, corruption and bribery are universal. In society, every individual is as stiff and formal, and as feelingly alive to every infraction of his privileges, as if his happiness or misery depended on the due observance of them. Nothing is more particularly attended to at entertainments by the master of the house, than the seating of every guest, and drinking their healths in the exact order of precedence.\n\nTo provide against future disputes on the subject of precedence, the respective ranks of all the Company's servants were ascertained by a resolution of government, which was revised and renewed in 1764. The act by which these rules were established consists of 131 articles, and enters into the most minute details respecting the carriages, horses, chairs, servants, &c., &c., of the Company's servants.\n\nBy the eighth article, little chaises for children, drawn by the hand, must not be gilt or painted, but in exact proportion to the rank of the parents. Ladies, whose husbands are below the rank of counsellors of the Indies, may not wear at one time jewels more in value than 6000 rix dollars; wives of senior merchants are limited to 4000; others to three, two, and 1000 rix dollars.\n\nArticle 49th permits ladies of the higher ranks to go abroad with three female attendants, who may wear \"ear-rings of single middle-sized diamonds, gold hair pins, petticoats of cloth, of gold, or silver gauze; chains of gold and of beads, and girdles of gold; but they must not wear diamonds, pearls, nor any kind of jewel in their hair.\" Wives of senior merchants may have two, and ladies in an inferior station one female attendant, who may wear \"ear-rings of small diamonds, gold hair pins, a jacket of fine linen, and a chintz pet-\nticoat; but no gold or silver stuffs, or silks, or any jewels, true or false pearls, or any ornament of gold.\"\u2014The 83d article recommends to the Dutch East India Company's servants in Bengal, not to surpass their predecessors in pomp of dress and appearance; and the 110th permits the director of the factory at Surat, when he goes abroad in state, to carry, among other things, four fans, made after the fashion of the country, with the feathers of the bird of paradise and cow hair, with gold cases and hands. It is remarkable, that in these regulations the tax on carriages increases downwards, from the higher to the lower ranks, and penalties are attached to the infraction of these statutes.\n\nIn addition to the baleful effects of the climate, and the marshy miasma of Batavia, the manner of life among the European part of the inhabitants contributes not a little to frequent and fatal diseases. A plentiful dinner at noon, with an afternoon's siesta, and a still more plentiful supper, terminates the day; in the course of which an immoderate quantity of claret, madeira, gin, and Dutch beer are consumed. Few Europeans can stand the effect of such a life. If one in three of the new comers survives the first year, he may account himself a favoured person; one in five annually is reckoned as the average of Europeans of all descriptions of men, including the troops.\n\nTo those who have stood the first attack, or seasoning, the fever becomes at last constitutional, and recurs at the moist and hot season regularly, without much inconvenience to the patient; sudden deaths, however, are so frequent, that they make little impression on the minds of the inhabitants. A Dutchman at Batavia, when he marries, makes his will, but this also usually accompanies a wedding in Holland, and is partly intended to regulate the property according to the wishes of the parties.\n\nMost of the white women seen at Batavia are born in India, and many so altered in figure, manners, and complexions, as to resemble the degenerate offspring of the Portuguese. They dress, when at home, exactly in the manner of their slaves, bareheaded, bare-footed, and wrapped in a loose long gown of red checkered cotton cloth, descending to the ankles, with large wide sleeves. They anoint their coarse black hair, with cocoa-nut oil, and adorn it with the tuberose, and other strong-scented flowers. In this loose and airy dress they loll about among their slaves (to whom they are occasionally very cruel), or sit on the ground, having their legs crossed under them, chewing betel, with which they are infatuated.\n\nThese ladies soon ripen, and soon decay: they are marriageable at 11 and 12 years of age, and are accounted old before 30. They have no resources within themselves, and many of them can neither read nor write, and are almost totally unqualified for the pleasures of social intercourse. Indeed the two sexes rarely meet in companies except at great entertainments, when each have generally their separate coteries; the men drinking and smoking in one apartment, the women chewing betel with their slaves in another.\n\nWhen they go abroad in the cool of the evening to some grand assembly, they dress themselves in a magnificent style. Their jet black hair twisted close to the head, sparkles with a profusion of diamonds, pearls, and jewels of various kinds, mingled with flowers of the Arabian jessamine and tuberose. Each lady has a female slave, almost as richly dressed as herself, sitting at her feet. Before supper is announced, they usually retire to put on their cotton nightgowns, and the gentlemen do the same, to exchange their heavy velvets for white cotton jackets; and the elderly gentlemen their wigs for night-caps. In this manner the day is concluded with a smoking hot sup-\nper, and its accompaniments, after which they retire to rest.\n\nThere is a race of Portuguese still remaining at Batavia, many of whom are artificers and servants in families. Their language is common here, and still continues to be understood in most of the old European settlements, which shews how deep a root that nation had taken during its prosperity. At Batavia their language has survived their dominion, and even their religion, which is still more extraordinary; their descendants having gradually embraced the Calvinistic tenets of the government\u2014a singular instance of Portuguese prayers and congregation out of the pale of the Roman communion.\n\nMost of the slaves at Batavia are imported from Celebes and the other eastern islands, particularly from that of Neas, off the western coast of Sumatra. The species of slavery at Batavia is of the very worst description, and the cruelties exercised on these forlorn wretches so great, as frequently to drive them to such an excess of desperation and madness, as to run the muck, and destroy whatever they approach, man or beast. The punishments inflicted by the Dutch government for this and other crimes, were so horrible and incredible, as to leave a doubt whether the perpetrators were human creatures, or devils in a human shape. That the severity of the punishment never prevented the crimes is proved by the fact, that at the British settlement of Bencoolen, where the punishments are of the mildest nature, the running the muck, or any desperate crime, scarcely ever occurs, while the reverse is the case of Batavia, and the Dutch settlements generally.\n\nWhen a rich proprietor is about to return to Europe, it is not unusual to manumit his slaves, but it is more frequent when he is at the point of death. A manumitted slave generally hires a small patch of ground from the servants of government, in which he cultivates flowers, fruits, and vegetables for the Batavian market. The most numerous, expert, and industrious of all the slaves imported to Batavia, are those from the Island of Celebes, and known by the name of buggesses and macassars.\n\n**Men.**\n\nIn 1804 the garrison of Batavia consisted of French auxiliary troops - - - - - - - - 240\n23d Dutch battalion - - - - 600\nNational troops, three battalions, of whom 200 officers and grenadiers were Europeans, the remainder Madurans and Samanaps - - - - 2400\nOne battalion infantry chasseurs, Madurans and Samanaps - - - - - - 400\nFloat artillery, mostly recruits, Madurans - - - - - - 600\nOne company light artillery - 100\nEuropean cavalry - - - - 200\n\nTotal 4540\n\nThere was also a corps of military engineers, mostly Europeans. All the troops, not absolutely requisite for the duties of the fortifications, are quartered in the environs, on account of the unhealthiness of the city; but the camps of Welte Freden and Jacatra, although a league and a half distant, are not exempt from disease, yet are, on the whole, healthier than the town. It has by some been conjectured, that the insalubrity of Batavia entered into the political system of the Dutch, with a view to its defence, and that the seasoned inhabitants are not particularly desirous of improving its climate, as it prevents the intrusion of foreign settlers, and gives them a monopoly of commerce, and the emoluments of office.\n\nIn 1799, the new camp at Welte Freden was established in a woody plain, a league and a half up the country, the land adjacent being dry, and the vicinity but little marshy. The road is along a fine causeway, with country seats on one side, and\non the other a navigable canal. The barracks, which are built of wood and stone, occupy a third of the ground on the opposite side of the entrance, Tannabang, a large Malay village, in which there are several Chinese families, stands on a height two and a half leagues from the city.\n\nMester Cornelis is a small fort, a league beyond Welte Freden, surrounded by small Javanese, Malay, and Chinese villages. The ground rises insensibly to Mester Cornelis, which is seen half a mile off. This fort lies in a hollow on the bank of the great river, commanded by a small height. On the right and left of the road are bamboo barracks for the Maduran artillery, of which this is the depot. The fort is built of stone, but is not strong, the demi-bastions being scarcely two feet thick, by four high, and surrounded by a dry ditch. The entrance is by a stone bridge, within which is the guardhouse, and near to it another house occupied by the European artillery. The fort is quitted by another bridge on the opposite side, communicating with a range of wooden barracks, in which are the artillery officers and the companies under training.\n\nA.D. 1619, the Dutch governor, General John Pieterson Coen took the town of Jacatra by assault, and in a great measure destroyed it. He afterwards founded another city, not exactly on the same spot, but very near to it, to which he gave the name of Batavia. During the hostilities which followed the French Revolution, Java was never attacked by the British, until the United States of Holland were formally annexed to the French dominions. In 1811 an expedition was prepared at the British settlements in India, which arrived in the roads of Batavia on the 4th of August of the same year, when the troops were immediately landed. On the 8th the city of Batavia surrendered at discretion to Sir Samuel Achmuty, General Jansens having retired to the fortified camp at Mester Cornelis, where, on the 25th of August, 1811, he was attacked by the British forces, and totally defeated. (Stavorims, Burrow, Quarterly Review, Tombe, Staunton, &c.)\n\nBatchian Isle.\u2014One of the Molucca Islands, separated from Gilolo by a narrow strait, and situated between the equatorial line, and the first degree of south latitude. It is of an irregular shape, but in length may be estimated at 52 miles, by 20 the average breadth. In 1775 the Sultan of Batchian claimed dominion over the islands of Ooby, Ceram, and Goran, but was himself entirely subject to the influence of the Dutch. The inhabitants of Batchian are Malays, and of the Mahommedan religion. (Forrest, &c.)\n\nBate Isle.\u2014An island belonging to the province of Gujrat, situated at the south-western-extremity of the Gulf of Cutch. Lat. 22\u00b0. 22'. Long. 69\u00b0. 21'. E. Bate signifies an island of any kind, but the proper name of this island is Shunkodwara.\n\nThis island has a good harbour well secured from the prevailing winds, but the anchorage is rocky. The fort of Bate has lately been much improved, but is still an insignificant place, being merely a square with a double wall on one side. It was, notwithstanding, attacked by a British force without success in 1803, which was attributed to the want of regular land forces. On this occasion many brave men lost their lives. About 150 vessels of different sizes belong to the port, which are employed chiefly to and from Mandavce, and until the interference of the British, were the piratical vessels so much dreaded by the traders on the western coasts of India. The destruction or occupation of the fort of Bate, will be the only effectual means of affording protection to the trade of the Gulf of Cutch, and would, probably, benefit both the inhabitants and the temples.\n\nThis island does not produce sufficient food for its own support, and consequently imports large quantities\nof ghee, sugar, grain, &c. which are consumed by the numerous pilgrims resorting to the holy places. The town of Bate contains about 2000 houses, chiefly inhabited by Brahmins, but all sorts of trades are also to be found. Vegetables, raised in small quantities, and milk, compose a considerable part of the food of the inhabitants; the fish, with which their shores abound, being held sacred. The Bate government has also Aramra, Positra, Bhurwalla, fortified places, and the little village of Rajpoor, subject to it. The whole revenue arising from the temples, the port duties, and the share of pirated property, probably, does not exceed two lacks of rupees per annum.\n\nBy an agreement executed with Major Walker, on the 14th Dec. 1807, Coer Babjee, of Bate, and Rana Sree Suggarmanjee, of Aramra, engaged not to permit, instigate, or connive at, any act of piracy committed by any person under their authority, and also to abstain from plundering vessels in distress. A free and open commerce to be permitted to all British vessels paying the regulated duties. The British, by this treaty, engaged to afford the temple at Bate suitable protection and encouragement.\n\nShunkodwar is the proper name of the Island of Bate, and is derived from that of a Hindoo demon so named, from his dwelling in a large shunk, or conch shell, wherein he concealed the sacred Vedas which he had stolen from Brahma. An incarnation of Vishnu, under the appellation of Shunknarrayan, cut open the shell, and restored the Vedas to their lawful owner. The demon pleaded as his excuse, that he hoped to have been put to death by Vishnu for the theft, which would have secured him future happiness.\n\nIn consequence of this exploit Shunknarrayan (Vishnu), or the destroyer of the shell demon, established his own worship on the island, where it continued paramount until the flight of another Hindoo deity, named Runchor, from Dwaraca, from a Mahommedan army, since which time Runchor has been supreme on Bate. This place was taken, in 1462, by Sultan Mahmood Begra, of Ahmedabad and Gujrat. (M'Murdo, Treaties, &c.)\n\nBatheri.\u2014A small village in Northern Hindostan, situated among the mountains in the province of Serinagur. Lat. 30\u00b0. 49'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 30'. E. This village is placed on the hill about 300 feet above the bed of the Bhagirathi, or Ganges, and has a small temple sacred to Mahadeva. In some parts of this neighbourhood the poppy is cultivated, and the opium extracted is said to be of an excellent quality. On the opposite side of the river is an extraordinary cascade, which issues from the summit of the mountain, and exhibits five distinct falls of water, one above the other. The top of the mountain is generally covered with snow, from the melting of which this cascade derives its chief supplies. (Raper, &c.)\n\nBatneer, (Bhatnir).\u2014A town in the province of Delhi, district of Hissar Firozeh, 170 miles N. W. from Delhi. West of this a barren sandy desert begins, there being no other town until the Sutuleje is approached. The chiefs of the Battie country, of which this is the capital, are called Rajpoot Mahommmedans; the common people are Jauts, most of whom have also become of that religion. This town was taken and destroyed by Timour in 1398. (G. Thomas, &c.)\n\nBatinda.\u2014A district in Hindostan, situated partly in the N. W. quarter of the province of Delhi, and partly in the northern extremity of the province of Ajmeer. This district comprehends the Lacky jungle, so much celebrated, for the fertility of its pasture lands, and for an excellent breed of horses. This jungle forms a circle of about 40 miles each way. On the north it is bounded by the country of Roy Kellaun, east by the province of Harrianeh, south by Batneer, and west by the great De-\nBATTAS.\n\nIt is situated 35 miles north from Batucre, and 80 west from Pattelech, to the chief of which place the Rajah of the Lacky jungle is tributary. The soil being sandy, the wells are excavated to a great depth. The country yields rice, bajerah, and other sorts of grain, but not abundantly. The original breed of horses in this country has been much improved by Persian horses, which were introduced during the invasions of Nadir Shah, and Ahmed Shah Abdallii. (Thomas, &c.)\n\nBATTOOL.\u2014A large fortified village and tank, situated near the sources of the Tuptee, among the mountains which bound the north of the Berar province. From Barooly Ghat to Batool is a table land, well cultivated with wheat, sugar-cane, Bengalgram, and other pulses. The village is populous, and placed in a fertile valley, near the ancient Kusba of Kurreem, now in ruins, three miles distant. (12th Register, &c.)\n\nBATTALAH, (or Vutala).\u2014A town in the province of Lahore, 75 miles E. S. E. from the city of Lahore. Lat. 31\u00b0. 34'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 3'. E.\n\nThis is a large town, and stands on a fine open plain, about 24 miles east from Amritsir. It is surrounded by groves of mango trees and tanks of water, and is considered the healthiest place in the Punjab. There is an excellent plum grows at this place, named aloocha; their apples also are larger and better than in most other parts of Hindostan. The hills lie about 70 miles distant, and in winter are covered with snow. (11th Register, &c.)\n\nBATTANTA.\u2014A small island in the Eastern Seas, about the 131st degree of east longitude, and separated from the island of Sallawatty by Pitts Straits. In length it may be estimated at 35 miles, by five miles the average breadth.\n\nBATTAMANDE.\u2014A point on the N. W. coast of Borneo, lat. 5\u00b0. 60'. N. Long. 116\u00b0. 45'. E. To the southward of Batoomande is a commodious bay, at the mouth of the Pan-dooossan River. From Pirates Point, which lies in 7\u00b0. N. are several bays, where shipping, working up and down the coast, may anchor safely, and get water from the shore. (Elmore, &c.)\n\nBATANPALLY ISLES.\u2014Two small islands off the western coast of Waggecoo, about the 130th degree of east longitude. They are both comprehended within the circumference of 18 miles.\n\nBATTAS, (Batah).\u2014A country in the Island of Sumatra, bounded on the north by that of Aceheen, and on the south by the independent district of Racc; extending along the sea coast, on the western side, from the River Singkel to that of Tabuyong, but inland to that of Ayer Baungs, and generally across the island, which is narrow in that part, to the eastern coast; but more or less encroached upon by the Malayan and Aceheense establishments.\n\nThe soil is fertile, and cultivation so much more prevalent than in the southern countries of the island, that there is scarcely a tree to be seen, except those planted by the natives, about their villages, which are found wherever a naturally strong situation presents itself. Water is not so abundant as to the southward, the country being comparatively level; about the Bay of Tappanooly the land is high and wooded. The Singkell River, which bounds this country, and is the largest on the west coast of Sumatra, rises in mountains about 30 miles from the sea. The Batta country is divided into many small districts, which yield gold, benzoin, cassia, camphor, &c.\n\nThe natives of the sea coasts exchange their benzoin, camphor, and cassia, (the quantity of gold dust is very small) for iron, steel, brass wire, and salt; of which last article 100,000 bamboos measure are annually taken off in the Bay of Tappanooly. These they barter again with the more inland inhabitants, for the convenience of which fairs are esta-\nblished at the back of Tappanooly. Having no coin, all value is estimated among them by certain commodities. The ordinary food of the lower classes is maize and sweet potatoes, rice being reserved for the rajahs and great men. Their houses are built of frames of wood, with the sides of board, and the roof covered with Ijoo.\n\nThe country is very populous, and chiefly in the central parts, where are extensive open plains, on the borders, it is said, of a great lake. The government of the Batta country, although nominally in the hands of three or more sovereign rajahs, is effectively divided into numberless petty chiefships, and it does not appear likely, from the manners and dispositions of the people, that the whole country was ever united under one supreme head. It is asserted that the succession to the chiefship goes to the nephew by a sister, as among the Nairs of Nalabar. The standard of the Battas is a horse's head, with a flowing mane, which seems to indicate a connexion with the Hayagrivas, of Sanscrit history.\n\nThe Battas, although of an independent spirit, have a superstitious veneration for the Sultan of Menancabow, and shew a blind submission to his relations and emissaries. In their persons, the Battas are rather below the stature of the Malays, and their complexions are fairer. Their dress is a sort of cotton cloth, manufactured by themselves. Their arms are matchlock guns, spears, and swords; the first they purchase from the Menancabow traders, and the last they make themselves, as also their gunpowder. The spirit of warfare is excited among these people by the slightest provocation; in fact, their life appears to be a state of perpetual hostility. They fortify all their villages; and, instead of tower or watch-house, they contrive to have a tall tree, which they ascend to reconnoitre or fire from.\n\nThe men are allowed to marry as many wives as they please, or can afford to have; half a dozen is not uncommon. The daughters are looked upon, as all over Sumatra, as the riches of the father. The condition of the women appears to be no other than that of slaves, the husbands having the power of selling their wives and children. They alone, besides their domestic duties, work in the rice plantations. The men, when not engaged in war, lead an idle inactive life, passing the day playing on a sort of flute. Like the rest of the Sumatrans, they are all much addicted to gaming; when a man loses more than he is able to pay, he is confined, and sold for a slave.\n\nThe most extraordinary of the Batta customs, though certainly not peculiar to this people, is the practice of eating the bodies of their enemies, whom they kill in battle, and also of a certain description of criminals. This extreme depravity has been long doubted, but is now established by a weight of testimony not to be resisted. The Battas are said to eat the body as a species of ceremony; as a mode of shewing their detestation of particular crimes by an ignominious punishment, and as a savage display of revenge and insult to their enemies. The objects of this barbarous repast are prisoners taken in war, especially if badly wounded; the bodies of the slain, and offenders condemned for certain crimes, particularly adultery. The prisoners unwounded (but the Battas are not much disposed to give quarter,) may be ransomed or sold as slaves, where the quarrel is not too inveterate. Convicts rarely suffer, when their friends are in circumstances to redeem them, by the customary equivalent of 80 dollars.\n\nMr. Marsden confines their cannibalism to the above two cases; but Dr. Leyden thinks that they frequently eat their own relations, when aged and infirm; not so much to gratify their appetite, as to perform a pious ceremony. Thus when a man becomes aged and infirm, he\nis said to invite his own children to eat him, in the season when salt and limes are cheapest. This, Dr. Leyden says, is the account which the Battas give of themselves, as well as of the Malays dwelling in their vicinity. This singular custom of Anthropophagy, practised by a nation in other respects more civilized than the Malays, by whom they are surrounded, attracted early the attention of Europeans, and led to the establishment of the fact.\n\nThe religion of the Battas, like that of all the other inhabitants of the island, who are not Mahommedans, is so obscure in its principles, as scarcely to afford room to say that any exists among them. They have, however, rather more ceremonies than the other Sumatrans, and there is an order of persons, called by them Gooroo (a well known Hindoo term), who may be denominated priests, as they are employed in administering oaths, foretelling lucky and unlucky days, making sacrifices, and the performance of religious rites. The ceremonies that wear most the appearance of religion are those practised on taking an oath, and at their funeral obsequies.\n\nEuropeans not being settled among the Battas on the same footing as in the pepper districts, the principles or practice of their laws is not well known. Open robbery and murder are punishable with death, if the parties are unable to redeem their lives by a sum of money. In cases of double adultery, the man, upon detection, is punished with death; but the woman is only disgraced by having her head shaved, and being sold for a slave, which in fact she was before.\n\nThe Batta language is probably the most ancient in Sumatra, and is the chief source of that diversity of dialect, which is discoverable in the languages of the island. The alphabet consists of 19 letters, each variable by six vocalic sounds. This language has a remarkable peculiarity; it is written neither from the left to the right, nor from the right to the left, nor from top to bottom; but in a manner directly opposite to that of the Chinese, from the bottom to the top of the line. The material for writing on is a bamboo, or branch of a tree, and the instrument for writing the point of a creese. The Battas sometimes read the bamboos horizontally, instead of perpendicularly; but they consider the correct mode of reading to be from the bottom to the top.\n\nThe Battas sometimes write on growing trees, and in this case, if a blank space occurs, it is towards the top of the division, a circumstance which determines what they consider as the natural position of their characters. It is remarkable that the proportion of people who can read and write, is much greater than of those who cannot.\n\nThat this extraordinary nation has preserved the rude genuineness of its character and manners, may be attributed to various causes; such as the want of the precious metals, the vegetable riches of the soil easily obtained, their ignorance of navigation, the divided nature of their government, which are circumstances unfavourable to the propagation of new opinions and customs; and lastly, the ideas entertained of the ferociousness of the people, from the practices above described, which may well be supposed to have damped the ardour, and restrained the zeal of religious innovators. (Marsden, Leyden, &c.)\n\n**Battecollah**, (Batucala). \u2014 A town on the sea coast of the British district of North Canara, which signifies the round town. Lat. 13\u00b0 56'. N. Long. 74\u00b0 37'. E.\n\nThis place stands on the north bank of a small river, the Sancadaholay, which waters a very beautiful valley, surrounded on every side by hills, and in an excellent state of cultivation. At the public expense eight dams are yearly made, in order to water the rice grounds, which are constructed of earth, and\nonly intended to collect the stream during the dry season.\n\nBattecollah is a large open town, containing 500 houses. It has two mosques, one of which receives an allowance of 100 pagodas from the Company, and the other half as much. Many of the Mahommedans are wealthy, and go on commercial speculations to different parts of the coast. In this part of the country there are none of the Buntar cast, nor does the language of Tulava extend so far north. Battecollah is properly in the country named Haiga, and the most common farmers are a kind of Brahmins, named Haiga, after the country, and a low cast of Hindoos, named Halepecas. There are here a great many guddies, or temples, belonging to the followers of Vyas. There are two Jain temples, the only remains of 68, that were formerly in the place. In this part of the country the Ikeri princes seem almost to have extinguished the Jains; but towards the north they appear to have met with a more vigorous resistance. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nBatties, (Bhatti).\u2014The country of the Batties, or Bhatties, is bounded on the north by the Punjab and the River Sutuleje; east, by the district of Hurrianah; west, by the desert; and south, by Bicanere.\u2014From north to south it extends about 150 miles, and from east to west about 100, and comprehends part of the provinces of Lahore, Delhi, and Ajmeer.\n\nThe part of the country best adapted for cultivation is along the banks of the River Cuggur, from the town of Futtehabad to Batneir. This portion of territory is very productive, which is caused by the abundance of water which descends from the mountains during the rainy season, and makes the Cuggur overflow. The land within the influence of this inundation produces wheat, rice, and barley, but the remainder of the Bhaty country, owing to a scarcity of moisture, is sterile and unproductive. The River Cuggur is afterwards lost in the sands to the west of Batneir, though it is said formerly to have joined the Sutuleje in the vicinity of Feroze-poor.\n\nBatneer is the capital of the Bhaty country; the other towns of note are Arroah, Futtehabad, Sirsah, and Ranyah. There is but little commerce carried on in this country, the inhabitants being more addicted to thieving than industrious pursuits. With the exception of the sale of their surplus grain, ghee, and cattle, they have little intercourse with the neighbouring states, and that principally through petty merchants of the Shiekh Fereed sect. Their imports are coarse white cloth, sugar, and salt, but the trade is very inconsiderable.\n\nThe Bhatties are properly shepherds; various tribes of them are found in the Punjab, and they are also scattered over the high grounds to the east of the Indus, from the sea to Uch. In the Institutes of Acber these tribes are called Ashambatty. Their chiefs were originally Rajpoots, but are now Mahommedans. A majority of the present inhabitants of the Bhaty country were originally Jauts, who afterwards turned Mahommedans. Their character is but indifferent, being described by their neighbours as cruel, savage, and ferocious thieves from their birth, and in the practice of adding murder to robbery. The Bhaty females are allowed to appear in public unveiled, and without that species of concealment so common over Hindostan, especially among the followers of Mahommed. (Thomas, Wilford, Drummond, &c.)\n\nBattowal.\u2014A town in the territories of the Poonah Maharattas, in the province of Aurungabad, 60 miles N. by W. from Ahmednuggur. Lat. 19\u00b0 52'. N. Long. 74\u00b0 56'. E.\n\nBattu, (Pulo Batu).\u2014An island lying off the western coast of Sumatra, situated immediately to the southward of the equinoctial line.\nIn length it may be estimated at 40 miles, by 10 miles the average breadth.\n\nThis island is inhabited by a colony from the Island of Neas, who pay a yearly tax to the Rajah of Baluaro, a small fortified village in the interior of the island, belonging to a different race, whose number it is said amounts to only 100, which it is not allowed to exceed, just so many children being raised as are sufficient to repair the deaths. They are reported to bear a resemblance to the people of Massacar and the Buggesses, and may have been adventurers from that quarter. The influence of the Baluaro Rajah over the Neas inhabitants, who exceed his immediate subjects in the proportion of 20 to one, is founded on a superstitious belief, that the water of the island will become salt when they neglect to pay the tax.\u2014He, in his turn, being in danger from the Malay traders, who resort hither from Padang, and are not influenced by the same superstition, is compelled to pay them an annual tribute of 16 ounces of gold.\n\nThe food of the people, as in the other islands of the Sumatra coast, is chiefly sago, and their exports cocoa nuts, oil in considerable quantities, and swallo, or sea slug. No rice is cultivated here. This island is visible from Natal Hill in Sumatra, and is entirely covered with wood.\u2014(Marsden, &c.)\n\nBattulaki.\u2014A harbour, situated at the northern extremity of the Island of Magindanao. Lat. 5\u00b0. 42'. N. Long. 125\u00b0. E.\n\nThis harbour is known by a remarkable rock, about the size of a large dwelling-house, of a pipe-clay colour, between which and the main is a reef of rocks, over which boats may pass at high water. In the harbour there is 10 fathoms water. The Dutch once attempted a settlement here, but were driven off by the natives. (Forrest, &c.)\n\nBaum Gunga, or Wainy River, (Vana Ganga, rapid as an arrow).\u2014This river rises in the hills of Choteesgur, in the province of Gundwana, and receives all the streams that have their sources on the S. W. side of the hills, which separate the champaign country of Choteesgur from Berar. Its course has never been completely traced, but it is supposed to join the Inderowty River, which flows into the Godavery, near Badrachellum. (Blunt, &c.)\n\nBawef.\u2014A small fortified town in the province of Cutch, situated on the road from Luckput Bunder to Mandavee, on the Gulf of Cutch, from which it is distant about 15 miles to the northward.\n\nThis place stands on the side of a hill to the northward of an extensive tank. The adjacent country is well cultivated, and the inhabitants appear industrious. From hence to Mandavee the road is generally good, but the country is less cultivated. (Maxfield, &c.)\n\nBaypoor.\u2014A town on the Malabar Coast, about 16 miles south from Calicut. Lat. 11\u00b0. 12'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 52'. E. Tippoo new named this place Sultanpatnem, and intended to have established it as one of his places of trade. Teak ships of 400 tons have been built here from timber procured in the neighbourhood. The teak tar is here extracted from the chips and saw-dust of the vessel, and is said to excel the Norwegian tar.\n\nBazaar.\u2014A small village in the province of Cabul, three-fourths of a mile from the western shore of the Indus, about 20 miles above the town of Attock. Lat. 33\u00b0. 19'. N. Long. 71\u00b0. 16'. E. The stream is here rapid, with a rough, undulating motion, and about three-fourths of a mile, or a mile in breadth, where it is not interrupted by islands, and having nearly a W. by S. course. The water is much discoloured by a fine black sand, which quickly subsides when put into a vessel. It is also very cold, owing to the mixture of snow from the mountains, when thawed by the summer heat.\nThis place has been conjectured to be the Bazira of the ancients. (Foster, Wilford, &c.)\n\nBeacul, (Vyacula).\u2014A strong native fort in the district of South Canara, placed, like Cananore, on a high projecting point into the sea, towards the south, and having within it a bay. Lat. 12\u00b0. 22'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 9'. E.\n\nThe town stands north from the fort, and contains about 100 houses. The inhabitants are chiefly Moplays and Muecas, with a few Tiars, and people of the Concan, who have long settled in Canara as shop-keepers. Beggars swarm here, as is the case everywhere in India, except Malabar, where there are very few. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nBeawull.\u2014A town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Khandesh, 35 miles S. W. from Boorhanpoor. Lat. 21\u00b0. 9'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 48'. E.\n\nBedagur, (Vedaghar).\u2014A town in the district of Gurrah, on the south side of the Nerbuddah River, 10 miles S. W. from Gurrah. Lat. 23\u00b0. 6'. N. Long. 80\u00b0. 5'. E.\n\nBedamungalum, (or Betumungalum).\u2014A town in the Rajah of Mysore's territories, near the eastern frontier. Lat. 12\u00b0. 58'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 24'. E. This place is situated about 300 yards west of the Palare River, which is not here above 40 feet wide, and in the month of May contains only two or three feet depth of water, nearly stagnant. In the rainy season it fills several fine reservoirs, or tanks, for the use of cultivation. All over the country in this vicinity common salt (muriate of soda) is very commonly diffused. It is found in low wet grounds, contained in a poor and black soil, and in Tippoo's reign was extracted in considerable quantities. At that time the trade with the Lower Carnatic being entirely contraband, so bulky an article as salt could not be smuggled in sufficient quantities for the consumption; the inhabitants were consequently obliged to have recourse to this native salt, against which, however, they have a strong prejudice. The black sand ore of iron abounds here in the torrents.\n\nThe country in this neighbourhood is exceedingly bare, and the population scanty. All the houses are collected in villages, and the smallest village is fortified. Baydamungalum was formerly a considerable place, and the residence of a polygar. In the dispute for the dominion between its ancient lord and Hyder, the town suffered exceedingly, and is now greatly deduced. The people in the adjacent country are a mixture of Tamuls, Telingas, and Carnatacas, or Canares, with a considerable number of Mahommedans. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nBednore, (Beidwurru).\u2014A district in the north-western extremity of the Rajah of Mysore's territories, situated on the summit of that range of western hills, which overlooks the provinces of Canara and Malabar, and named the Western Ghauts. These mountains, elevated from four to 5000 feet above the level of the sea, present to the west a surface in many places nearly perpendicular to the horizon, and by their height intercept the clouds of the western monsoon. Nine rainy months in the year are usually calculated on in this climate, and for six of that number it is customary to make the same preparatory arrangements for provision (water excepted), as are adopted in a ship proceeding on a voyage. This extraordinary moisture is not only favourable to the growth of the peculiar products of the province, but covers the face of the country with timber of great stature, with underwood scarcely penetrable.\n\nThe exports from this district consist chiefly of pepper, betel nut, sandal wood, and cardamoms. The imports are salt, rice, cocoa nuts, oil, turmeric, and cotton cloths. The roads being bad, most of the goods are carried to Mangalore by porters, the most important article being betel nut. The difference of elevation\nmakes this climate a month later than it is on the sea coast. The cattle, like those below the Ghauts, are remarkably small. The country breeds more than is required for its cultivation, and a considerable surplus is annually exported to the sea coast. The horses are indifferent, but might be improved by sending into the district a few stallions.\n\nWhen conquered by Hyder, in 1762, the Bednore dominions extended over the maritime province now named Canara, and to the east over a tract of more open country, extending to Sunta, Bednore, and Hoolukera, within 20 miles of Chiteldroog. (Willis, F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\n**Bednore.\u2014** A town in the Rajah of Mysore's territories, the capital of a district of the same name. Lat. 13\u00b0. 48'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 6'. E.\n\nThis place was originally named Biderhully, or Bamboo Village, until the seat of government was removed from Ikeri to this town, after which it was named Bideruru, or Bamboo Place. On this transfer, the whole revenue of the country being expended here, Bednore immediately became a city of great magnitude and commerce, and is said to have then contained 20,000 houses, besides huts, defended by a circle of woods, hills, and fortified defiles. When taken by Hyder, in 1763, it was estimated at eight miles in circumference, and it is said the plunder actually realised amounted to 12 millions sterling. He afterwards changed its name to Hydernagur.\n\nThis place was taken and plundered by the British detachment from Bombay, under Gen. Matthews, in 1783, but they were afterwards attacked by Tippoo, assisted by the French, and all destroyed, or made prisoners.\n\nAt Tippo's death it contained 1500 houses, besides huts, and it is fast recovering, being a convenient thoroughfare for goods. During the Rauny's government, 100 families of Concan Christians settled at Bednore, and subsisted chiefly by dis-\n\ntilling and selling spirituous liquors. Tippoo carried them all to Seringapatam.\n\nTravelling distance from Seringapatam 187 miles N. W. from Madras 445 miles; from Poonah 382 miles. (F. Buchanan, Wilks, Ronnel, &c.)\n\n**Beechipoor.\u2014** A village in the province of Sinde, situated on the west side of the Goonoe, on the route from Hyderabad, the capital of Sinde, to Mandavee, a sea port on the Gulf of Cutch, by the way of Luckput Bunder. Lat. 24\u00b0. 35'. N.\n\nIn this neighbourhood are a number of fine trees resembling the apple tree, also the Laurestinus cherry and drooping willow, and abundance of the lye bush. The soil is rich, but except close to the banks of the river is wholly uncultivated, and covered with jungle. Nor is any advantage taken of the numerous natural canals with which the country is intersected. They remain overgrown with rank weeds and bushes, which impede the navigation, and vitiate the atmosphere. (Maxfield, &c.)\n\n**Beeder.\u2014** A province in the Deccan, now possessed by the Nizam, situated principally betwixt the 16th and 18th degrees of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by Aurungabad and Nandere; on the south by the River Krishna; to the east it has the province of Hyderabad; and to the west the province of Bejapoor. In length it may be estimated at 140 miles, by 65 the average breadth.\n\nThe surface of this province is uneven and hilly, but not mountainous, and it is intersected by many small rivers, which fertilize the soil, and flow into the Beemah, Khrisna, and Godavery. The country is very productive, and under the ancient Hindoo government contained a redundant population, but it is now thinly inhabited compared with the British provinces. Although long the seat of a Mahommedan sovereignty, and still subject to princes of that religion, the Hindoos probably still ex-\nceed the Mahommedans in the proportion of 10 to one. The junction of the three languages, Telinga, Maharatta, and Canara, takes place in this province, somewhere near its capital.\n\nThis province is now wholly comprehended within the dominions of the Nizam, and governed by his officers. The principal towns are Beeder, or Ahmedabad, Kalbergah, and Caliany.\n\nAfter the Mahommedan conquest this province was the seat of the Bhamener dynasty of Deccan sovereigns, the first of whom was Sultan Allah nd Deen Houssun Kangoh Bhamenee, A.D. 1347, whose capital was Kalbergah. Besides the princes of the Nizam Shahy, Adil Shahy, and Koottub Shahy, founded on the ruins of the Bhamence dynasty, there arose two others, composed of parts of their once extensive dominions. One was founded by Ameer Bereed about 1518, the prime minister, or rather confiner of the two last Bhamence Sultans, and called from him Bereed Shahy. His dominions were small, consisting of the capital Bedeer, and a few districts round that city. The honours of royalty did not long remain in his family, his territories being wrested from his grandson by the other Deccan princes, and the kingdom of Beeder destroyed.\n\nAlong with the other Deccany provinces, it fell under the Mogul dominion towards the conclusion of the 17th century, during the reign of Aurengzebe, from whose successors it was separated in 1717 by Nizam ul Muluck, and has ever since been possessed by his posterity, the Nizams, resident at Hyderabad. (Ferishta, Scott, MacKenzie, &c.)\n\nBeeder.\u2014A town in the province of Beeder, of which it is the capital. Lat. 17\u00b0. 47'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 48'. E.\n\nThis city is fortified with a stone wall, a dry ditch, and many round towers. The wall is six miles in circumference, and the town it encloses stands in an open plain, except the east side, which is a rising ground about 100 yards high. It is much decayed, but the remains of many good buildings are still to be seen. It was formerly noted for works of tutenague inlaid with silver. Before the Mahommedan invasion Bedeer was the capital of a Hindoo sovereignty. Near the ruins of the old Bedeer, Ahmed Shah Bhamenee founded the city of Ahmedabad, which he made his capital in place of Kalbergah, and this is the modern Bedeer.\n\nTravelling distance from Hyderabad 78 miles, from Delhi 857, from Madras 430, and from Calcutta 980 miles. (Upton, Scott, Rennel, &c.)\n\nBeejapoor.\u2014A town in the Maharatta dominions, in the province of Aurungabad, 65 miles N. from Ahmednuggur. Lat. 19\u00b0. 54'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 1'. E.\n\nBeemah River, (Bhima, terrific).\u2014This river rises in the mountains to the north of Poonah, not many miles from the source of the Godavery, and passes within 30 miles to the east of Poonah, where it is called Bewrah, as well as Beemah, and is esteemed a sacred river. It is one of the principal rivers that join the Krishna, which it does near the town of Firozegur, in the province of Beeder. The length of its course, including the windings, may be estimated at 400 miles.\n\nThe horses most esteemed by the Maharattas are those bred on the banks of the Beemah. They are of a middle size, and strong, are rather a handsome breed, generally dark bay, with black legs, and are called, from the country which produces them, Beemarteddy horses. (Rennel, 5th Register, &c.)\n\nBeenishenr.\u2014A town in northern Hindostan, situated close to the Himalaya mountains, in the district of Mulliboom, of which it is the capital. Lat. 28\u00b0. 21'. N. Long. 84\u00b0. 20'. E. This town stands at the confluence of the Salegrami, or Gunduck, and a small stream named the Hehagde. It is an entrepot of con-\nsiderable trade, and is sometimes named Beeni-jee, by way of emi-\nnence. (Kirkpatrick, &c.)\n\nBeggah, (Rigga).\u2014A small town formerly fortified in the province of\nBahar, district of Ramgur, 82 miles S. from Patna. Lat. 24\u00b0. 25'. N.\nLong. 85\u00b0. 20'. E.\n\nBehawulpoor.\u2014A town in the province of Mooltan, 37 miles S. by\nE. from the city of Mooltan. Lat. 30\u00b0. 4' N. Long. 71\u00b0. 30'. E. This\ntown is situated near the Gharrah River, in a very bad part of the de-\nsert. It derives its name from the Nabob Bhawul Khan, of the Abassi\nfamily, and surnamed Dadpootee. He died in 1808, leaving a son under\nage, whose territories were in a si-\ntuation of great danger from the am-\nbitious views of the Amiers of Sinde.\nThe Behawulpoor state extends a\nconsiderable way towards Bicanere,\nbut is tributary to the sovereigns of\nCabul. To travel in this arid re-\ngion, it is necessary to have an es-\ntablishment of camels to carry a sup-\nply of water, as in the deserts of\nArabia. (Registers, Smith, &c.)\n\nBekrad.\u2014A small district in the\nprovince of Cabul, situated betwixt\nthe 34th and 35th degrees of north\nlatitude. It has the district of Mun-\nderar to the north, a range of hills\nto the south, the River Chuganserai\nto the east, and the River Alishung\nto the west.\n\nIn 1582 it is described by Abul\nFazel as follows:\u2014\"The district of\nBekrad is full of infidels. Instead\nof lamps they burn green fir, which\ngives a very good light. Here is an\nanimal called a flying fox, which\nflies about an ell from the ground.\nHere are also mice, which have a\nfine musky scent. Pooluk Bekrad\n2,045,451 dams.\"\n\nBehut River.\u2014See Jhyulum.\n\nBeiduru.\u2014An open village in the\ndistrict of North Canara, containing\nabout 150 houses. Lat. 13\u00b0. 49'. N.\nLong. 74\u00b0. 43'. E.\n\nBeiduru once had a fort, and was\nthen a large place, belonging to a\nJain princess, named Byra Devi,\n\nbut the Jain sect are now quite ex-\ntinct here. At this place there is a\ntemple dedicated to Siva, in which\nare many inscriptions. These in-\nscriptions, among the Hindoos, seem\nto be what the legends on the coins\nare among the Mahomedans, and\nso long as there is a nominal king all\ninscriptions and legends are made in\nhis name. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nBejagur, (Vijayaghar).\u2014A dis-\ntrict in the province of Malwah,\nsituated about the 22nd degree of\nnorth latitude. Although to the south\nof the Nerbuddah, in the Institutes\nof Acber, A. D. 1582, it is placed\nin the viceroyalty of Maluah, and is\ndescribed as follows:\u2014\"Sircar Bee-\njagur, containing 32 mahals, mea-\nsurement 283,278 beegahs, revenue\n12,249,121 dams. Seyurghal 3574\ndams. It furnishes 1773 cavalry,\nand 19,480 infantry.\"\n\nThis district is now possessed by\ndifferent Maharatta chiefs. The chief\ntowns are Awass, Sindwah, and\nGherowd.\n\nBEJAPOOR.\n\nA large province in the Deccan,\nextending from the 15th to the 19th\ndegrees of north latitude. To the\nnorth it is bounded by the province\nof Aurungabad; on the south by the\nToombuddra River, and district of\nNorth Canara; on the east by Au-\nrungabad and Beeder; and on the\nwest by the sea. In length it may\nbe estimated at 350 miles, by 200\nmiles the average breadth.\n\nThe western districts of this pro-\nvince are very mountainous, parti-\ncularly in the vicinity of the Ghauts;\nbut towards the east the country is\nmore level, and watered by many\nfine rivers, the principal of which\nare the Krishna, the Beemah, the\nToombuddra, and the Gutpurha.\nPrior to 1790 the latter was the\nboundary which separated the do-\nminions of Tippoo from those of the\nMaharattas.\n\nThere is nothing peculiar in the\nagriculture or production of this pro-\nvince, which are the same as in the other regions of the Deccan. The horses reared on the banks of the Beemah are held in great estimation by the Maharattas, and furnish the best cavalry in their armies. All the sea coast being in the possession of that nation, who are little addicted to maritime commerce, the greater part of what traffic subsists is carried on by land carriage with the interior, but the extent of this species of interchange all over the Deccan is considerable.\n\nFour-fifths of this province have long appertained to the Maharattas, and the remainder is under the government of the Nizam. The Peshwa is the nominal lord of the whole, but possesses effective jurisdiction over but a small portion, the maritimes district of Concan being the largest territory actually within his own power. The principal cities are Poonah, Bejapoor, Satarah, Mer-ritch, or Mirjee, Darwar, Punder-poor, Hubely, and Huttany.\n\nThe population of this province cannot be compared with the best of the British territories, but is probably equal to that of the Balagbaut ceded territories, which being a recent acquisition, have not had sufficient time for improvement. Taking the latter as a scale of comparison, the inhabitants may be estimated at seven millions; of which number, probably, not more than one-twentieth are Mahomedans, the rest being Hindoos of the Brahminical persuasion.\n\nIn this province, approaching the Krishna from the southward, the Maharatta tongue comes more and more into use; leaving this river to the south, the Cauara dialect declines in a similar proportion, so that the Krishna may be deemed the dividing boundary of the two languages, but the Canara is rather more spoken to the northward, than the Maharatta to the south of the river. The Krishna is also remarkable for dividing different stiles of building. To the south the houses of the lower class are flat roofed, and covered with mud and clay; northward the roofs are pitched and thatched.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Bhamenee dynasty of the Deccan, Abouul Muzaffar Adil Shah founded the Adil Shahy sovereignty of Bejapoor, A.D. 1489, comprehending within the circle of his government all the country from the River Beemah to Bejapoor. In 1502 he introduced the ceremonies of the Shicah sect of Mahommedans, which did not, prior to this period, exist in the Deccan. He died A.D. 1510, and his successors were,\n\nIsmael Adil Shah, died 1534.\nMuloo Adil Shah, deposed and blinded, having reigned six months.\nIbrahim Adil Shah, died 1557. During his illness this prince put to death several physicians who had failed in effecting his cure, beheading some, and treading others to death with elephants, so that all the surviving medical practitioners being alarmed, fled his dominions.\nAli Adil Shah, assassinated 1579.\nIn the year 1564, the four Mahommedan Sultans of the Deccan formed a confederacy against Ram Rajah, the Hindoo sovereign of Bijanagur; and having totally defeated and slain him in battle, took and plundered his capital. With him ended the long established and powerful Hindoo dynasty of Bijanagur.\nIbrahim Adil Shah the Second, died 1626. In this reign the Mogul power began to be severely felt in the Dekkan.\nMahommed Adil Shah, died A.D. 1660. In this reign Sevajee the Maharatta revolted, which, with the Mogul conquests, reduced the Bejapoor principality to the last extremity.\nAli Adil Shah the Second. This prince died in 1672, after a turbulent reign, during which he enjoyed little more of royalty than the name, his country being usurped by Sevajee, and other vassals.\nSecunder Adil Shah, who never ac-\nquired any real power, being merely an instrument in the hands of his nobility; and with him the Adil Shahe dynasty ended in 1689, when Bejapoor was besieged and taken by Aurengzebe, Secunder Adil Shah being among the prisoners.\n\nThis Mahonmedan dynasty of Bejapoor was remarkable for the practice of conferring Hindoo titles, they being, in general, exclusively Arabic.\n\nThe destruction of the Bejapoor Deccany empire, and the beginning of that of the Maharattas, happened so nearly at the same time, that this province cannot with strictness be said ever to have been subject to the throne of Delhi, although regularly enumerated in the list of soubahs. During the reign of Aurengzebe its possession was disputed with much slaughter, but his successors early abandoned it to the Maharattas, and with them the greatest proportion has remained ever since.\n\nAt the conclusion of the war between the British and Sindia in 1804, the whole of the Maharatta territories in this province exhibited a scene of the greatest anarchy; and although nominally subject to the Peshwa, his authority scarcely extended beyond the city of Poonah, and was resisted by the chief of every petty village. The different chiefs and leaders of banditti, by whom the country was occupied, were almost innumerable; but the names and designations of the principal were Goklah, Appah Saheb, and Bala Saheb (the sons of Purseram Bhow, and heads of the Putwurden family), Appah Dessaye, Furkiah, Bapoojee Sindia, Madarow Rastiah, the Rajah of Colapoor, Futteh Singh Bhoonslah, Chintamnuy Row (the nephew of Purseram Bhow), Tantia, Punt Pritty Niddy, and others of inferior note depending on these leaders.\n\nOwing to the long confusion that had subsisted, the country had been ravaged and depopulated in various modes, and amongst others by the rapid succession of governors appointed by the Peshwa, the preceding one always strenuously resisting his successor. The chiefs above named were not properly Jaghireddars, although distinguished by the appellation of the Southern Jaghireddars. They were the Serinjamy Sirdars of the Poonah state; and it is peculiarly the case with Serinjamy lands, that the possession of them may be changed annually, and are granted for the payment of troops actually employed in the service of the state. The chiefs in question, however, had retained possession of the lands for many years, and had also properties of other descriptions under the Poonah government.\n\nTo reduce this chaos to order, the British government was obliged to interpose its arbitration, and began by endeavouring to ascertain the extent of the service to which the Peshwa was entitled from the Southern Jaghireddars, with the view of inducing them to afford that service. On the other hand, it was resolved to protect the Jaghireddars from the oppression of the Peshwa's government, and to guarantee to the Jaghireddars their possessions, while they continued to serve the Peshwa with fidelity. On this occasion the Marquis Wellesley was obliged to express his utter disapprobation of the Peshwa's projects of vengeance and rapine against the principal families of the Maharatta state in immediate subjection to Poonah, and particularly his highness's designs against the Putwurden family.\n\nTo accomplish this most desirable arrangement, and to restore tranquillity and good government to a region long deprived of both, Gen. Arthur Wellesley (now Duke of Wellington) was instructed to enter into negotiations with the different chiefs, during his march southwards in 1804, to reconcile their dissensions, and adjust their disputes with their sovereign the Peshwa. Difficult as the task appears, he effected it without bloodshed by his tempe-\nrate and decided conduct, and more especially by the penetration with which he at once fixed on a proper mode of commencing the settlement of so many complicated claims and discordant interests, in which he was ably seconded by Col. Close, then resident at Poouah, and Mr. Strachey, whom he had appointed agent with the Southern Jaghireddars. (MSS. Ferishta, Scott, Moor, Wilks, &c.\n\nBEJAPOOR, (Vijayapura, the Impregnable).\u2014A city in the province of Bejapoor, of which it was the capital, when an independent kingdom. Lat. 17\u00b0. 9'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 42'. E. In old European books it is generally named Viziapoor.\n\nWhen taken by Aurengzebe in person, A.D. 1689, it stood on an extensive plain, the fort being one of the largest in the world. Between it and the city wall there was room for 15,000 cavalry to encamp. Within the citadel was the king's palace, the houses of the nobility, and large magazines, besides many extensive gardens, and round the whole a deep ditch, always well supplied with water. There were, also, without the walls, very large suburbs and noble palaces. It is asserted by the natives, with their usual exaggeration, that during its flourishing state it contained 984,000 inhabited houses, and 1600 mosques.\n\nAfter its capture the waters of the reservoirs and wells in the fort decreased, and the country round became waste to a considerable distance. At present it exhibits almost nothing but ruins, which prove the vast magnitude of this city during its prosperous state.\n\nThe outer wall, on the western side, runs nearly north and south, and is of great extent. It is a thick stone wall, about 20 feet high, with a ditch and rampart. There are capacious towers, built of large hewn stones, at the distance of every hundred yards; but are, as well as the wall, much neglected, having in many places fallen into the ditch, and being in others covered with rubbish. A mile and a half from the western wall is a town called Toorvee, built on the remains of the former city, and surrounded by magnificent piles of ruins, among which are the tombs of several Mahomedan saints, attended by their devotees. The court way of the fort is from 150 to 200 yards broad, and the ditch, now filled with rubbish, appears to have been a very formidable one, excavated out of the solid rock on which the fort stands. The curtain is nearly 40 feet high from the berm of the ditch, entirely built of huge stones strongly cemented, and frequently adorned with sculptural representations of lions, tigers, &c. The towers flanking the curtain are very numerous, and of vast size, built of the same kind of materials. Measured by the counterscarp of the ditch, the fort is probably about eight miles in circumference. The curtain and towers in the southern face are most battered, as it was against these Aurengzebe raised his batteries.\n\nThe mosque and mausoleum of Ibrahim Adil Shah are built on a basement 130 yards in length, and 52 in breadth, and raised 15 feet. Inside it is a plain building, 115 by 76, covered by an immense dome, raised on arches. The mausoleum is a room 57 feet square, enclosed by two verandas 13 feet broad, and 22 feet high. Besides these there are many other public buildings, much injured by time and the Maharattas.\n\nThe fort in the interior is adorned with many handsome edifices, in rather better preservation than the fort. The great mosque is 97 yards by 55 yards. The wings, 15 yards broad, project 73 yards from the north and south ends, enclosing on three sides with the body of the mosque a large reservoir for water, and a fountain. The mausoleum of Sultan Mahmood Shah is a plain building, 153 feet square, over which is reared a dome of 117 feet diameter.\nin its concavity, called by the natives the great cupola.\n\nThe inner fort consists of a strong curtain, frequent towers of a large size, a fausse bray, ditch, and covered way; the whole built of massy materials, and well constructed. The ditch is extremely wide, and said to have been 100 yards; but its original depth cannot now be discovered, being nearly filled up with rubbish. The fort inside is a heap of ruins, none of the buildings being in any repair, except a handsome little mosque built by Ali Adil Shah. This inner fort was kept exclusively for the palaces of the kings, and accommodation of their attendants. The fort now contains several distinct towns, and although so great a part is covered with ruins, there is still room found for some corn fields and extensive enclosures. The inner fort, which is more than a mile in circumference, appears but as a speck in the larger one, which, in its turn, is almost lost in the extent occupied by the outer wall of the city.\n\nMost of the buildings (the palaces in the fort excepted) appear to have had little or no wood used in their construction. They are, in general, built of the most massy stone, and in the most durable stile; notwithstanding which the workmanship of some is minutely elegant. The city is well watered, having, besides numerous wells, several rivulets running through it. To the north there are but few hills, the country being, in general, level, and the soil rich; yet it is described as destitute of wood, and but little cultivated. The city is but thinly inhabited, and is now comprehended in that part of the Bejapoor province belonging to the Maharattas. According to tradition it must have once been immensely rich, and it is said that large sums of money and valuables are still found secreted among the ruins.\n\nSome enormous cannon, still remaining here, correspond with the magnitude of the fort. Only 12 are said to be left, the dimensions of the three largest are as follows:\n\n1st. A Malabar gun.\n\n| Feet. Inches. |\n|----------------|\n| Diameter at the breach | 4 5 |\n| Length from breach to muzzle | 21 5 |\n| Circumference of the trunnions | 4 7 |\n| Diameter at the muzzle | 4 3 |\n| Ditto of the bone | 1 9 |\n\nThe second is a brass gun cast by Aurengzebe to commemorate the conquest of Bejapoor.\n\n| Feet. Inches. |\n|----------------|\n| Diameter at the breach | 4 10\u00bd |\n| Ditto at the muzzle | 4 8 |\n| Ditto of the bone | 2 4 |\n| Length | 14 1 |\n| Circumference in the middle | 13 7 |\n\nThe third gun is called the high-flyer, and measures in length 30 3\u00bd\n\n| Feet. Inches. |\n|----------------|\n| Circumference at the breach | 9 2 |\n| Circumference over the moulding, measured at the smallest part | 6 0 |\n| Diameter of the bone | 1 1 |\n\nThe first and last of these guns are constructed of bars of iron, hoop'd round, not upon carriages, but lying on blocks of wood. The brass gun is fixed on its centre, on an immense iron fixed in the ground, and grasping its trunnions in the manner of a swivel, its breech resting on a block of wood, supported by a thick wall, so that it cannot recoil. For the calibre of this gun an iron bullet, weighing 2646 pounds, would be required.

On a plain, at the bottom of the hill, is the pettah, inclosed by a stone wall of good construction. The walls of the fort are new, but they are ill-provided with artillery; and the ascent to them is not difficult.\n\nThe surrounding country consists of ranges of low hills much covered with jungle, and separated from each other by intermediate plains, intersected by deep ravines; but, upon the whole, well supplied with water from wells, which have been dug, and from nullahs.

This is a town of some antiquity, being described by Abul Fazel, in 1582, as being very healthy, and famous for producing men with melodious voices. It is still distinguished by a ruinous fort and moat. The ruined buildings appear to have been in the best style of Mogul architecture; but the present inhabitants, few in number, dwell in small structures, either of mud or timber. (Abul Fazel, Tenant, &c.)\n\nBelhary, (Valahari).\u2014A very ancient town in the northern extremity of the province of Gundwana.

The streets are paved, though roughly, and the houses built of stone and mortar. From Bellaspoor fertile vallies, though not wide, extend to Bipolle. This is the residence of the rammy, or female ruler of the Calowr territory. (Foster, &c.)\n\nBellumcondah.\u2014A town in the Northern Circars, district of Gun-\ntoor. Lat. 16\u00b0. 22'. N.

This place is in the Garuda Giri district, which has long formed part of the dominions of the Mysore family. In the surrounding country there are many sheep, and but few black cattle. The shepherds and their families live with their flocks. The men wrap themselves up in their blankets, and sleep in the open air among their sheep. The women and children sleep under hemispherical baskets, about six feet in diameter, and wrought with leaves, so as to turn the rain. At one side a small hole is left, through which they can creep, and this is always turned to leeward, there being nothing to cover it.\n\nBenares, (Varanasi).\u2014A large district, or zeminary, in the province of Allahabad, situated principally betwixt the 24th and 26th degrees of north latitude. When ceded, in 1775, by Asoph ud Dowlah, the Nabob of Oude, this zeminary was divided into 62 pugunmahs, containing 12,000 square miles, of which 10,000 are a rich, cultivated flat on both sides of the Ganges. The chief subdivisions are Benares, Gazypoor, Jionpoor, and Chunar. In the Institutes of Acber, A. D. 1582, Abul Fazel describes it as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Benares, containing eight mahals; measurement 136,663 bee-gahs; revenue, 8,169,318 dams.\u2014Seyurghal, 338,184 dams. This Sircar furnishes 830 cavalry, and 8400 infantry.\"\n\nThe atmosphere of this province, which in winter is so severe as to render fires necessary, becomes so heated for three months after March, by the setting in of the hot winds, as to destroy all verdure, and would probably prove destructive to all European artificial grasses, were the cultivation introduced. Turnips, radishes, and a variety of greens and garden stuffs are raised by the natives, principally for the Europeans.\n\nThere is not much land employed in the raising of rice, the chief articles of produce being barley, wheat, and several species of the pea. A small quantity of flax is raised in the skirts of almost every field, for the sake of the oil; its use, as an article of clothing, is not here understood. Every field of barley contains a mixture of grain or pease; and at the distance of six or 10 feet, there is planted a beautiful yellow flowering shrub used in dyeing.\n\nA considerable quantity of sugar is produced in this district. The apparatus is extremely simple. A stone mortar and wooden pistern turned by two bullocks, the whole not worth 12 rupees, constitute the most expensive part of the operation. The boiling pots are of the common earthen ware, and here, as in the West Indies, the sugar harvest is a joyous and busy season.\n\nFrom Patna to Buxar, Gazypoor, Benares, and Mirzapoor, much cultivation and a rich country presents itself, and the numerous clumps of mango trees give the district the appearance of a forest, and afford an agreeable retreat to the cattle. Both sides of the river a little way above Mirzapoor formerly belonged to the Nabob of Oude, and exhibited a marked contrast to the flourishing state of the Benares districts; which, probably, in the scale of prosperity, excel all others in India, except Burdwan in Bengal.\n\nPlain and flowered muslins, adapted to common uses, are manufactured in the northern, baftas in the western, and sanaes in the eastern parts of the province. Tissues, brocades, and ornamented gauzes are a general manufacture. Benares is supplied with salt of its own manufacture, joined with importations from Sambher in Ajmeer, and other\nplaces. A great quantity of excellent indigo is annually raised and exported from this province, which also furnishes a proportion of the Company's opium. The principal rivers are the Ganges, the Gomtity, the Carammassa, and the Soane, the two latter being boundary rivers; and, on the whole, the country is extremely well supplied with water. The principal towns are Benares, Mirzapoor, Jionpoor, Chunar, and Gazypoor.\n\nIn 1801, by the directions of the Marquis Wellesley, then governor-general, the board of revenue circulated various questions to the collectors of the different districts on statistical subjects. The result of their replies proved, that the Benares province contained 3,000,000 of inhabitants, in the proportion of one Mahommedan to five Hindoos, and that the zemindar's annual profit on his lands exceeded 10 per cent. on the revenue derived from them by the government.\n\nThe code of regulations for Bengal has, with very little alteration, been extended to Benares; but, in consideration of the high respect paid by the Hindoo inhabitants to the character of their Brahmans, they have received some special indulgences in the mode of proceeding against them on criminal charges; and it has further been provided in their favour, that, in all cases, where, by law, a Brahmin would be adjudged to suffer death, the sentence shall be changed to transportation, or mitigated at the discretion of government.\n\nAt the same time some evil practices of the Brahmans were suppressed; one of which was, the holding out the threat of obtaining spiritual vengeance on their adversaries by suicide, or the exposure of the life, or the actual sacrifice of one of their own children or near relations. It was ordered, that occurrences of this nature should not, in future, be exempt from the cognizance of the magistrate, and the usual course of criminal law. Another tribe of Hindoos, residing in the province, named Rajcoomars, were accustomed to destroy their female infants, in consequence of the difficulty experienced in suitably marrying them. From this practice they were prevailed on to desist by the resident, Mr. Duncan; and an observance of it now subjects the offender to the ordinary punishment of murder.\n\nMusuram, the grandfather of Cheit Singh, possessed originally but half the village of Gungapoor, by additions to which, in the usual modes of Hindostan, he laid the foundation of the zeminary of Benares. He died in 1740, and was succeeded by his son, Bulwant Singh, who, in 30 years of his own management, increased his acquisitions to the present size of the province. Cheit Singh received the zeminary in 1770, and was expelled in 1781, during the government of Mr. Hastings. (Tennant, J. Grant, Colebrooke, 5th Report, &c.)\n\nBenares.\u2014A celebrated city in the province of Allahabad, the capital of the Benares districts. Lat. 25\u00b0. 30'. N. Long. 83\u00b0. E. The sanscrit name is Varanashi, from Vara and Nashi, two rivers.\n\nThe Ganges here forms a fine sweep of about four miles in length; on the external side of the curve, which is the most elevated, is situated the holy city of Benares. It is covered with buildings to the water's edge, and the opposite being level, the whole may be viewed at once. Ghauts, or landing-places, built of large stones, are very frequent, and are 30 feet high before they reach the level of the street, the erection of them being frequently executed by Hindoos as an act of piety.\n\nThe streets are so extremely narrow, that it is difficult to penetrate them, even on horseback. The houses are built of stone, some six stories high, close to each other, with terraces on the summit, and\nextremely small windows, to keep them cool, and prevent inspection. The opposite sides of the streets, in some places, approach so near to each other, as to be united by galleries. The number of stone and brick houses, from one to six stories high, is upwards of 12,000. The mud houses, above 16,000; and, in 1803, the permanent inhabitants, by enumeration, exceeded 582,000.\u2014This is exclusive of the attendants of the three Mogul princes, and several other foreigners, who may amount to 3000; and, during the festivals, the concourse is beyond all calculation. The Mahommedans are not supposed to be more than one in ten.\n\nThe mosque, with its minars, was built by Aurungzebe, to mortify the Hindoos. Not only is it placed on the highest point of land, and most conspicuous, from being close to the river; but the foundations are laid on a sacred spot, where a Hindoo temple before stood, which was destroyed to make room for it. From the top of the minars there is an extensive view of the town and adjacent country, and of the numerous Hindoo temples scattered over the city and the surrounding plains.\n\nThe houses of the English at Serole are handsome, although they look naked from the want of trees; but this is absolutely necessary in India, on account of the harbour they afford to musquetoes.\n\nThe Rajah of Benares resides at Ramnagar, on the opposite side of the river, about five miles from Benares. In this city there are 8000 houses occupied by Brahmans, who receive charitable contributions, although each has property of his own.\n\nThere are but few Europeans here: a judge, collector, and register, with a few other civil servants, constitute the whole of the Company's establishment; to which may be added, a few private merchants and planters. Amidst such a crowd of natives, and in so sacred a town, it may be supposed the mendicants are very numerous; many of the natives, however, possess large fortunes, and are actively engaged in trade as merchants or bankers. Benares is the great mart for diamonds and other gems, brought principally from the Bundelcund country. The land in and about Benares is extremely high priced, and law-suits respecting it unceasing.\n\nReading and writing are taught here at the same time. The boys are collected on a smooth flat of sand; and, with the finger, or a small reed, form the letters in the sand, which they learn to pronounce at the same time. When the space before each scholar is filled up with writing it is effaced, and prepared for a new lesson.\n\nThis city has long been celebrated as the ancient seat of Brahminical learning, and it is so holy, that several foreign Hindoo Rajahs have vakeels, or delegates, residing here, who perform for them the requisite sacrifices and ablutions. Its ancient name was Casi (the splendid), which it still retains, but there are not any notices concerning it in the works of the ancient geographers, although they specify Mathura (Methora) and Chisobara, which lay near the Jumna.\n\nIn the year 1017, Sultan Mahmood of Ghizni took Benares, and the town of Casum or Casuma, now Patna, and went as far as the country of Ouganam, or Unja, to the west of the Cossinbazar River. The next year he overrun these countries again, and penetrated as far as Kisraji, or Cachcha Raja, or Cooch Bahar. From that time the Hindoos, in this part of India, remained for a long time unmolested by the Mahommedans, as it does not appear they made any permanent conquests in this province before the end of the 12th century, or about 1190.\n\nOn the 14th Jan. 1799, Mr. Cherry, the resident, and three other English gentlemen, were treacherously murdered here by Vizier Ali, the deposed Nabob of Oude, and spurious\nson of the late Asophud Dowlah. Mr. Davis, the judge of the city, defended himself and family with a short spear, at the top of a narrow winding stair-case, on the flat roof of the house, until assistance arrived.\n\nThe Benares division of the court of circuit comprehends the following districts, viz. 1. Mirzapoor; 2. Allahabad; 3. Bundelcund; 4. Jumapoor; 5. Goruckpoor; 6. City of Benares.\n\nThe travelling distance from Benares to Calcutta by Birbhoon is 460 miles, by Moorsheadabad 565, from Allahabad 83, Buxar 70, Bareily 345, Calpy 239, Kanoge 259 miles. (Lord Valentia, Tennant, 3d Register, Wilford, Rennel, 5th Report, &c.)\n\nBencoolen, (Bencooln, or Fort Marlborough).\u2014The chief establishment possessed by the East India Company, situated on the S.W. side of the Island of Sumatra. Lat. 3\u00b0. 50'. S. Long. 102\u00b0. 3'. E.\n\nBy agreement with the neighbouring chiefs the lands for this settlement were taken possession of so far back as 1685, but many years past before it attained a stable form, owing to the opposition of the Dutch, and other circumstances. So early as 1698, this settlement had already cost the East India Company 200,000l. and was at the same time so unhealthy, that, in the year 1705, the governor, three civil servants, and 41 slaves, died. The foundations of Fort Marlborough were laid in 1714; but, in 1719, the settlers were expelled by the natives, who, growing alarmed lest the Dutch should take advantage of the absence of the English, soon after permitted them to resettle, and complete the fort.\n\nFrom this time the Company's affairs on this coast remained in a state of tranquillity until 1760, when the French, under Compte d'Estaing, destroyed all the English settlements on the coast of Sumatra; but they were soon re-established, and possession secured by the treaty of Paris in 1763. Fort Marlborough, which had hitherto been a subordinate of Fort George, or Madras, was then formed into an independent presidency.\n\nThe expenses of the government of Bencoolen having increased very much, exceeding the revenue 90,000l. per annum, and the settlement having become of little importance as a commercial establishment, since pepper, the only produce of the adjacent country, could be more advantageously supplied from Prince of Wales Island and Malabar, it was not judged expedient to keep up the establishment as a principal government. In Aug. 1801, accordingly, the directors ordered it to be reduced to a residency, under the management of a resident and four assistants, subject to the immediate direction of the government of Bengal. The civil servants, rendered supernumeraries by this arrangement, were transferred to Madras.\n\nThere is now only one solitary cargo of pepper of the value of 15,000l. sent annually from Bencoolen, which is all its commerce with England. In 1810 the woollen goods exported by the East India Company to Bencoolen, were valued only at 4276l.\n\nIn 1810, the Company's property at this place in buildings and fortifications was\n\n| Valued at | \u00a3243,640 |\n|-----------|-----------|\n| Plate, furniture, plantations, farms, vessels, and stores | 74,544 |\n\n\u00a3318,184\n\nProvisions and refreshments of all sorts are scarce and expensive at Bencoolen, and the trade insignificant. The principal imports are opium, piece goods, and grain; and the chief exports pepper, and other spices, and bullion. (Marsden, Macpherson, Bruce, &c.)\n\nBenner, (Banker).\u2014A small district in the province of Cabul, ex-\ntending along the west side of the Indus, and situated about the 34th degree of north latitude. From the geographical position it appears to be the district described by Abul Fazel under the name of Bembher, viz.\n\n\"The length of Bembher is 16, and the breadth 12 coss. On the east lies Puckely, on the north Kinore and Cashgur, on the south Attock Benares, and Seward is the western extremity. There are two roads from it to Hindostan; one by the heights of Surkhaby, and the other by the Molundery Hills. Neither of these roads are good, but the first is most difficult to pass.\"\n\nIn modern times Benerer has been estimated at 40 miles in length, and nearly the same in breadth; but, like the other regions of this part of Asia, its extent is not accurately known. (Abul Fazel, Leyden, &c.)\n\nBENGAL, (Bangala).\n\nA large province in Hindostan, situated between the 21st and 27th degree of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by the dominions of Nepaul and Bootan; to the south by the Bay of Bengal; on the east it has Assam and the Ava territories; and on the west the province of Bahar. In length (including Midnapoor) it may be estimated at 350 miles, by 300 miles the average breadth. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"The soubah of Bengal is situated in the second climate. From Chittagong to Kunbee is 400 coss difference of longitude, and from the northern range of mountains to the southern extremity of Sircar Madarun (Birbhoon) comprehends 200 coss of latitude. When Orissa was added to Bengal, the additional length was computed to be 43 coss, and the breadth 20 coss. Bengal was originally called Bung. The soubah of Bengal consists of 24 sircars, and 787 mahals. The revenue is 1,49,61,482 sicca rupees, and the zemindars (who are mostly koits) furnish 23,330 cavalry, 801,158 infantry, 170 elephants, 4260 cannon, and 4400 boats.\"\n\nWhen Abul Fazel compiled the Institutes of Acber, the government of Bengal extended to Cuttack, and along the Mahanuddy River, Orissa not being then formed into a distinct soubah, which appears from the arrangement of the 24 sircars, viz.\n\n\"1. Oudumbhier, or Tandeh; 2. Jennetabad; 3. Futchhabad; 4. Mahmoodabad; 5. Khalifetabad; 6. Boakla; 7. Purneab; 8. Taujepoor; 9. Ghoraghant; 10. Pinjerah; 11. Barbuckabad; 12. Bazooha; 13. Soonargong; 14. Silhet; 15. Chatgong; 16. Shereefabad; 17. Solimabad; 18. Satgong; 19. Madarun; 20. Jellasir; 21. Buddruck; 22. Cuttek; 23. Kulangdunpant; 24. Rajc Mahindra. The five last are in Orissa.\"\n\nThe natural situation of Bengalis singularly happy with respect to security from the attack of foreign enemies. Along the whole northern frontier from Assam westwards, there runs a belt of low land from 10 to 20 miles in breadth, covered with the most exuberant vegetation, particularly of a rank weed, named in Bengal the angeah grass, which grows to the height of 30 feet, and is as thick as the wrist, and mixed with these are tall forest trees. Beyond this belt rise the mountains of Northern Hindostan, containing a thinly-scattered and unwarlike population.\n\nOn the south of Bengal is a sea coast guarded by shallows and impenetrable woods, with only one port, and that of extremely difficult access. It is on the west only that any enemy is to be apprehended, and there the natural frontier is strong, and the adjacent countries sterile and thinly peopled. The Ganges intersects Bengal in a southeasterly direction, and separates it into two territorial divisions nearly equal in extent; in case of invasion the tract to the east of that river would be exempt from the ravages\nof war, and present an asylum to the inhabitants, especially against armies of cavalry. The north-west is the most assailable quarter, but possesses many strong points of defence.\n\nThe area of Bengal and Bahar is 149,217 square miles, and with Benares not less than 162,000 square miles. The following proportions of this surface are grounded on many surveys after making allowance for large rivers.\n\n| Parts                                      | Area |\n|--------------------------------------------|------|\n| Rivers and lakes (one-eighth)              | 3    |\n| Decmed irreclaimable and barren (one-sixth)| 4    |\n| Site of towns and villages, highways, ponds, &c.

The latter consisting of part of the Morung, Cooch Bahar, and other districts, which have become tributary since the English acquired their present influence in Bengal.\n\nThe first aspect of this province suggests for it the designation of a flat campaign country. The elevated tracts it contains are only an exception to the general uniformity, and the inundation which annually takes place in the regions watered by the Ganges, seems the consequence of a general descent, and does not any further invalidate the notion of a general level.\n\nThe tract of annual inundation was anciently called Beng, whence, probably, the name Bengal was derived; the upper parts of Bengal, which are not liable to inundation, were called Barendra.\n\nRice, which is luxuriant in the tract of inundation, thrives in all the southern districts; but, in the ascent of the Ganges, it is observed gradually to yield the first place in husbandry to wheat and barley.\n\nThe mulberry, acclimated in the middle provinces of Bengal, shews a better defined limit when it meets the culture of the poppy, which is peculiar to the northern and western provinces.\n\nIn the opinion of the Hindoos, the resort of the antelope sanctifies the country graced by his presence, an opinion more connected with physical observation, than with popular prejudice. The wide and open range in which the antelope delights, is equally denied by the forests of the mountains, and by the inundation of the fens.\n\nThe periodical winds that prevail in the Bay of Bengal, extend their influence over the flat country until they are diverted by chains of mountains into another direction, nearly correspondent, however, with the course of the Ganges. Northerly and southerly winds blow alternately, during unequal portions of the year, over that portion of the province which faces the head of the bay. The northerly wind prevails during the cold season, a southerly one during the hot; but the period of their change seems earlier on the eastern side of the Delta than on the west: corresponding herein with a similar difference in the periodical winds on the respective shores of the bay. The seasons of Bengal conform nearly with these changes of the prevailing winds. They are commonly distinguished by the terms cold, hot, and rainy.\n\nIn the beginning of April, and sometimes earlier, particularly in the south-eastern quarter of Bengal, there are frequent storms of thunder, light-\nning, wind, and rain, from the north-west quarter, which happen more frequently towards the close of the day than at any other time. During this season much attention and care is required in navigating the large rivers. These squalls moderate the heat, and continue until the setting in of the periodical rains, which generally commence the beginning of June. If the rains break up early in September, the weather is intensely hot, and the inhabitants, especially the European part, become very sickly.\n\nThe natives, from the result of their own experience, assign six seasons to the year, each containing two months. The spring and dry season occupy four months, during which the heat progressively increases, until it becomes almost intolerable, even to those born in the country. In the middle districts it is lessened by the occasional thunder storms, named north-westers; and, in the eastern, milder showers of rain are still more frequent, and refresh the atmosphere.\n\nThe scorched inhabitants are, at length, relieved by the rainy season, which, in general, commences nearly at the same time throughout the whole province. During the first two months the rain is heavy and continual. In this period an interval of many successive days is rare, and the rain pours with such force and perseverance, that three, four, and even five inches of water have fallen in a single day. In the two subsequent months the intervals are more frequent, and of longer duration, and the weather more sultry. The rivers, and especially the Ganges, which begins to rise even before the commencement of the rainy season, continue to increase during the two first months of it, and the Ganges reaches its greatest height in the third. By this time the rivers of Bengal are swollen, and the Delta of the Ganges overflowed. The average annual fall of rain in the lower parts of Bengal is seldom short of 70, and as rarely exceeds 80 inches.\n\nAt the approach of winter the rivers begin to decrease, the showers cease to fall, and the inundation gradually drains off and evaporates. Fogs, the natural consequence of such evaporation in cold weather, are frequent in most parts of Bengal Proper. Dew, at this season, is everywhere abundant and penetrating; and, in the higher latitudes of India, as well as in the mountainous tracts of it, frost and extreme cold are experienced. Even in the flat country ice is obtained by the simple artifice of assisting evaporation in porous vessels, although the atmosphere be much warmer than the freezing temperature. Throughout the whole winter, in Bengal, dews continue copious, and greatly assist vegetation, affording nearly as much moisture as corn requires in a soil so loose.\n\nThe general soil of Bengal is clay, with a considerable proportion of silicious sand, fertilized by various salts, and by decayed substances, animal and vegetable. In the flat country sand is everywhere the basis of this stratum of productive earth, which indicates an accession of soil on land which has been gained by the dereliction of the water. A period of 30 years scarcely covers the barren sand with soil sufficient to fit it for rewarding the labours of the husbandman, the lapse of half a century does not remove it half a span from the surface. In tracts which are annually inundated, the progress is more rapid, because the superincumbent water, having dissolved clay, deposits it in the progress of evaporation. Running water deposits sand, and keeps the clay, calcareous matter, and other fertilizing substances, suspended. If the variable proportions of clay and sand, and the circumstance of frequent alterations in the channels of rivers, be considered, great inequality of soil may be expected, though it be composed of few substances.\n\nIn the tract subject to annual inundation, insulated habitations, and\nfields considerably raised above the level of the country, exhibit the effects of patient industry. In the same tract, during the season of rain, a scene presents itself, interesting by its novelty; a navigation over fields submerged to a considerable depth, while the cars of rice float on the surface. Stupendous dikes, not altogether preventing inundation, but checking its excesses. The peasants repairing to the markets, and even to the fields, on embarkations, accompanied by their families and domestic animals, from an apprehension that the water might rise suddenly, and drown their children and cattle, in the absence of their boats. When the peasant's habitation is passed, and the height observed of the flood, nearly to the level of the artificial mound on which his dwelling stands, his precaution does not appear superfluous.\n\nThe assemblage of peasants in their villages, their small farms, and the want of enclosures, bar all great improvements in husbandry; in a country, however, so infested by tigers and gang robbers (dacoits) or river pirates, solitary dwellings, and unmatted cattle, would be insecure. Another obstacle to improvement is the mixture of trades; the peasants indifferently quitting the plough to use the loom, and the loom to resume the plough.\n\nIn Bengal and Bihar only one-third of the land is estimated to be tilled, but this is exclusive of lays or fallows. In England there are four acres of arable and meadow land for every inhabitant; in Bengal little more than one acre of tilled ground for every inhabitant. The natural seasons of rice are ascertained from the progress of the wild plant. It sows itself in the first month of the winter, and vegetates with the early moisture at the approach of the rains. During the period of the rains it ripens, and drops its seed with the commencement of winter.\n\nThe common husbandry sows the rice at the season when it should naturally vegetate, to gather a crop in the rains; it also withholds seed until the second month of that season, and reaps the harvest in the beginning of winter. The rice of this last crop is esteemed the best, not being equally liable with the other to decay. The several seasons of cultivation, added to the influence of soil and climate, have multiplied the different species of rice to an endless diversity.\n\nOther corn is more limited in its varieties and in its seasons. Of wheat and barley few sorts are distinguished; they are all sown at the commencement of the cold season, and reaped in the spring. A great variety of different sorts of pulse, (such as peas, chicches, pigeon pease, kidney beans, &c.) finds its place also in the occupations of husbandry, no season being without its appropriate species; but most sorts are sown or reaped in winter. These constitute a valuable article in the Bengal husbandry, because they thrive even on poor soils, and require but little culture. Millet and other small grains are also of importance; several sorts, restricted to no particular season, and vegetating rapidly, are useful, because they occupy an interval after a tedious harvest, which does not permit the usual course of husbandry. Maize is less cultivated in Bengal than in most countries where it is acclimated. It is the most general produce of poor soils in hilly countries, and is, consequently, very generally cultivated in the more western provinces, which are of an irregular surface.\n\nThe universal and vast consumption of vegetable oils in Bengal is supplied by the extensive cultivation of mustard seed, linseed, sesamum, and palma christi, besides what is procured from the cocoa nut. The first occupy the cold season; the sesamum ripens in the rains, or early after their close.\n\nAmong the most important of the productions of Bengal are, tobacco, sugar, indigo, cotton, the mulberry,\nand poppy\u2014most of which require land solely appropriated to the cultivation of each.\n\nThe plough in this province is drawn by a single yoke of oxen, guided by the ploughman himself. Two or three yoke of oxen, assigned to each, relieve each other until the daily task is completed. Several ploughs, in succession, deepen the furrows, or rather scratch the surface; for the implement which is used throughout India wants a contrivance for turning the earth, and the share has neither width nor depth to stir a new soil. A second ploughing crosses the first, and a third is sometimes given diagonally to the preceding. These, frequently repeated, and followed by the branch of a tree, or some other substitute for the harrow, pulverize the soil, and prepare it for the reception of seed. The field must be watched several days, to defend it from the depredations of numerous flocks of birds. It is necessary, also, to prolong the defence of the field in those districts, which are much infested by wild boars, elephants, buffaloes, and deer. For this purpose a bamboo stage is erected, and a watchman stationed on it to scare wild animals, should any approach. In all districts, maize and some sorts of millet, when nearly arrived at maturity, generally need defence from the depredations of birds by day, and of larger bats by night.\n\nThe sickle, for the scythe is unknown, reaps every harvest. With this the peasant picks out the ripest plants, yet often suffers another field to stand long after the greatest part of the crop is arrived at maturity.\n\n\u2014The practice of stacking corn, intended to be reserved for seed, is very unusual, the husk which covers rice preserves it so effectually. At the peasant's convenience, the cattle tread out the corn, or his staff threshes out the smaller seeds. The grain is winnowed in the wind, and is stored either in jars of unbaked earth, or in baskets made of large twigs.\n\nThe practice of storing grain in subterraneous hoards, which is frequent in Benares and the western provinces, and also in the south of India, is not adapted to the damp climate and moist soil of Bengal, where grain is hoarded above ground, in round huts, the floor of which is raised a foot or two from the surface.\n\nIn the management of forced rice, by irrigation, dams retain the water on extensive plains, or preserve it in lakes to water lower lands, as occasion may require. Reservoirs, ponds, water courses, and dikes, are more generally in a progress of decay than of improvement. The rotation of crops, which engrosses so much the attention of enlightened cultivators in Europe, is not understood in India.\n\nA course of husbandry, extending beyond a year, was never dreamed of by a Bengal farmer. In the succession of crops within the year, he is guided by no choice of an article adapted to restore the fertility of land impoverished by a former crop. The Indian cultivator allows his land a lay, but never a fallow. The cattle kept for labour and subsistence are mostly pastured on small commons, or other pasturage, intermixed with arable lands, or they are fed at home on cut grass. The cattle for breeding and for the dairy are grazed in numerous herds in the forests or on the downs. The dung, in place of being applied to the fields, is carefully collected for fuel. The Bengal farmer restricts the use of manure to sugar cane, mulberry, tobacco, poppy, and some other articles. Few lands unassisted are sufficiently fertile to afford these articles. Of the management of manure little occurs worthy of particular notice, except to mention, that oil cake is occasionally used as a manure for sugar cane.\n\nThe simple tools which the native employs in every art, are so coarse, and apparently so inadequate to their purpose, that it creates surprise how he can effect his undertaking; but the long continuance of feeble efforts accomplishes what, compared with\nthe means, appears impracticable.\u2014The plough is among the instruments that stand most in need of improvement. The readiness with which the Indian can turn from his usual occupation to another branch of the same act, or to a new profession, is characteristic of his country, and the success of his earliest efforts, in an employment new to him, is daily remarked with surprise.\n\nThe want of capital in manufactures and agriculture prevents the subdivision of labour. Every manufacturer and every artist working, on his own account, conducts the whole process of his art from the formation of his tools to the sale of his production. Every labourer and artizan, who has frequently occasion to recur to the labours of the field, becomes a husbandman.\n\nIn Bengal, where the revenue of the state has had the form of land rent, the management of the public finances has a more immediate influence on agriculture, than any other branch of the administration. It may be presumed, however, the lands in Bengal are better cultivated and rendered more productive, as notwithstanding the increased export of grain, (from 30 to 45,000 tons annually), and the large tracts of country required for the growth of sugar, indigo, and other articles exported by sea, the price of rice, and every other kind of food used by the natives, so far from being enhanced, was considerably lower on the average of the 10 years, from 1790 to 1800, than during any preceding period since the acquisition of the province; nor has Bengal suffered a famine of any severity since the year 1770, which is more than can be said for any other part of India.\n\nThe orchard in this province is what chiefly contributes to attach the peasant to his native soil. He feels a superstitious veneration for the trees planted by his ancestors, and derives comfort and profit from their fruit. Orchards of mango trees diversify the plain in every part of Bengal; the palmira abounds in Bahar. The cocoa nut thrives in those parts of Bengal which are not remote from the tropic. The date tree grows everywhere, but especially in Bahar. Plantations of areca are common in the centrical parts of Bengal. The bassia thrives even on the poorest soils, and abounds in the hilly districts. Its inflated corolos are esculent and nutritious, and yield, by distillation, an intoxicating spirit. The oil expressed from its seeds is, in mountainous districts, a common substitute for butter.\u2014Clumps of bamboos abound and flourish as long as they are not too abruptly thinned. This plant is remarkable for the rapidity of its growth. Its greatest height is completed in a single year; and, during the second, its wood acquires all the hardness and elasticity which render it so useful. They supply the peasant with materials for building, and may also yield him profit, as it is probable a single acre of thriving bamboos produces more wood than ten of any other tree.\n\nPotatoes have been introduced into Bengal, and apparently with the most beneficial effect. The quantity procured by Europeans, at almost every season of the year, shews they are not unsuited to the climate. The small potatoe is little, if at all inferior in quality to that of England; but the crop being less abundant, this article in the market is generally dearer than rice. The watery insipidity of tropical plants is a circumstance universally noticed by Europeans on their arrival in the East Indies. Asparagus, canthiflower, and other esculent plants, are raised, but they are, comparatively, tasteless.\n\nA cultivator in Bengal, who employs servants, entertains one for every plough, and pays him monthly wages, which, in an average, do not exceed one rupee per month; in a very cheap district the wages are so low as half a rupee; but the task on the medium of one-third of an acre\nper day is completed by noon. The cattle are then left to the herdsman's care, and the ploughman follows other occupations during the remainder of the day. Generally, he cultivates some land on his own account, and this he commonly rents from his employer for a payment in kind.\n\nIf the herd be sufficiently numerous to occupy one person, a servant is entertained, and receives in food, money, and clothing, to the value of one rupee and a half per mensem. The plough itself costs less than a rupee. The cattle employed in husbandry are of the smallest kind; the cost, on an average, being not more than five rupees each. The price of labour may be computed from the usual hire of a plough with its yoke of oxen, which may be stated on the medium to be about 4d. per day.\u2014The cleaning of the rice is executed with a wooden pestle and mortar, the allowance for husking it being nearly uniform; the person performing this contracting to deliver back five-eighths of the weight in clean rice\u2014the surplus, with the chaff or bran, paying for the labour. Five quarters of rice per acre are reckoned a large produce, and a return of 15 for one on the seed.\n\nAs a middle course of husbandry, two yearly harvests may be assumed from each field; one of white corn, and another of pulse, oil seed, or millet. The price of corn in Bengal fluctuates much more than in Europe, and has a considerable influence on the value of most other articles, though it cannot regulate the price of all. When the crops of corn happen to be very abundant, it is not only cheap, but wants a ready market; and, as the payment of the rent is regulated by the season of the harvest, the cultivator thereby sustains considerable detriment.\n\nThe profits of cattle consist in the increase of stock and the milk of bullocks, which are grazed at a very small expense, not exceeding half a rupee annually, and quarter a rupee for cows. Cattle constitute a considerable portion of the peasant's wealth, and the profits of stock would be much greater, did the consumption of animal food take off barren cows, and oxen which have passed their prime. This is not sufficient to render the stock of sheep an object of general attention. Their wool supplies the home consumption of blankets, but it is too coarse, and produces too low a price, to afford a large profit on this species of stock.\n\nThe abundance of fish afford a supply almost attainable to every class, and in the Ganges and its innumerable branches are many different kinds. Their plenty at some seasons is so great, that they become the ordinary food of the poorest natives, who are said to contract diseases from too liberally indulging themselves. The smallest kind are all equally acceptable in a curry, the standing dish in every native family throughout Hindostan; in fact, with a pilau, it nearly comprehends their whole art of cookery. The bickty, or cockup, is an excellent fish, as is also the sable fish, which is uncommonly rich. But the best and highest-flavoured fish, not only in Bengal, but probably in the whole world, is the mango fish, so named from its appearing in the rivers during the mango season. They are a favourite dish at every European table, particularly during the two months when they are in roe. Small mullet abound in all the rivers, and may be killed with small shot, as they swim against the stream, with their heads partly out of the water. Oysters are procured from the coast of Chittagong, not as large, but fully as well flavoured as those of Europe. Alligators and porpusses abound in all the Bengal rivers, when there are also incredible quantities of small turtle, which are, however, of a very bad quality, and only eaten by some inferior casts of natives.\n\nThe native Bengally horse, or tattoo, is a thin, ill-shaped, and every way contemptible animal, and is never used in a team, bullocks being\nselected for that purpose. The Bengally cart is nearly as bad as their plough, with ill made wheels and axle trees, which never being oiled, make a loud screeching noise; nor can the native driver be prevailed upon to alter what was the custom of his forefathers. The elephants, camels, and oxen, attached to the Company's troops, are kept in excellent condition. The buffaloes are generally jet black, with long semi-circular horns, which, instead of standing erect, or bending forward, are laid backwards on the neck. When he attacks, he puts his snout between his forelegs, which enables him to point his horns forward. The Bengally sheep are naturally of a diminutive breed, thin and lank, and of a dark grey colour; but when fattened for the table, the mutton equals that of Europe. Some have four horns, two on each side of the head.\n\nPariah dogs infest the streets of all the towns in Bengal; and the approach of evening is announced in the country by the howling of numerous flocks of jackals, which then quit their retreats in the jungles.\u2014Apes and monkies swarm in all the woods, and sometimes plunder the fruit shops of a village. Being a sacred animal, the natives often voluntarily supply their wants, and seldom injure them. The brahmuny, or sacred bull of the Hindoos, also rambles about the villages without interruption; he is caressed and pampered by the people, to feed him being deemed a meritorious act of religion. The crow, kite, mayana, and sparrow, hop about the dwellings of the Bengalese with a familiarity and sense of safety unknown in Europe. Storks are seen in great numbers; and, from their military strut, are named adjutants by the European soldiers. Toads, snakes, lizards, and insects, which also abound, are their food.\n\nThe staple productions of Bengal for exportation are, sugar, tobacco, silk, cotton, indigo, and opium.\n\nTobacco it is probable was unknown to India as well as to Europe, before the discovery of America. It appears from a proclamation of the Emperor Jehangire, mentioned by that prince in his own memoirs, that it was introduced by Europeans into India, either in his own reign (the beginning of the 17th century), or during that of his father Acber. The Hindoos have names for the plant in their own language; but, these names not excepting the sanscrit, seem to be corrupted from the European denomination of the plant, and are not to be found in old compositions. The practice, however, of inhaling the smoke of hemp leaves, and other intoxicating drugs, is ancient; and for this reason the use of tobacco, when once introduced, soon became general throughout India. The plant is now cultivated in every part of Hindostan. It requires as good soil as opium, and the land must be well manured. Though it be not absolutely limited to the same districts, its culture prevails mostly in the northern quarter, and is but thinly scattered in the southern. Including every charge for duties and agency, it may be procured in Calcutta at about eight shillings per maund of 80 pounds.\n\nThe sugar cane, the name of which was scarcely known to the ancient inhabitants of Europe, grew luxuriantly throughout Bengal in the remotest times. From India it was introduced into Arabia, and from thence into Europe and Africa. From Benares to Rungpoor, and from the borders of Assam to Cuttack, there is scarcely a district in Bengal or its dependent provinces, wherein the sugar cane does not flourish. It thrives most especially in the districts of Benares, Bahar, Rungpoor, Bhubnun, Burdwan, and Midnapoor\u2014is successfully cultivated in all; and there seems to be no other bounds to the possible production of sugar in Bengal, than the limits of the demand, and the consequent vent for it. The growth for home consumption and for inland trade is vast, and\nit only needs encouragement to equal the demand for Europe also. It is cheaply produced, and frugally manufactured. Raw sugar, prepared in a mode peculiar to India, but analogous to the process of making muscovado, may generally be purchased in the Calcutta market, under sicca rupees (18s. 6d.) per maund of about 80 pounds weight.\n\nCotton is cultivated throughout Bengal, and has lately been raised and exported by sea in increased quantities. Besides what is produced in the country, a large importation takes place from the banks of the Jumna and the Deccan. It is there raised so much more cheaply than in Bengal, that it supports a successful competition, notwithstanding the heavy expenses of distant transport by land and water. A fine sort of cotton is grown, in the more eastern parts of Bengal, for the most delicate manufactures; and a coarse kind is gathered from every part of the province, from plants thinly interspersed in fields of pulse. The names of cotton, in most European languages, are obviously derived from the Arabic word kuth (pronounced cootn). Some sorts are indigenous to America; others are certainly natives of India, which has at all times been the country most celebrated for cotton manufactures.\n\nDifferent sorts of cotton, very unequal in quality, are imported into Bengal; the best is brought by land from Nagpoor, in the Deceau to Mirzapoor, in the province of Benares, which town is the principal inland mart for cotton. Its average price may be reckoned there, at 2l. 5s. per cwt. The usual price at Nagpoor, from a variety of averages, is equivalent to two pence halfpenny per pound. Cotton is also imported from Jalooan, a town situated to the west of the Jumna River, from Hatras in the province of Agra, and from other places.\n\nEurope was anciently supplied with silk through the medium of Indian commerce. The ancient language of India has names for the silk worn and manufactured silk; and, among the numerous tribes of Hindoos, derived from the mixture of the original tribes, there are two classes, whose appropriate occupations were the feeding of silk-worms and the spinning of silk. A peasant, who feeds his own silk-worms, has full employment for his family. The rearing of the silk-worms is principally confined to a part of the district of Burdwan, and to the vicinity of the Bhagirathi and Great Ganges, from the fork of these rivers, for about a hundred miles down their streams. The stations where the Company's investment of silk is principally procured, are, Comercelly, Jungeypoor, Bauliah, Malda, Radnagore, Rungpoor, and Cossimbazar.\n\nThere is also a considerable quantity of silk obtained from wild silk-worms, and from those which are fed on other plants, besides the mulberry. Much silk of this kind supplies home consumption; much is imported from the countries situated on the north-east border of Bengal, and on the southern frontier of Benares; much is exported, wrought and unwrought, to the western parts of India, and some enters into manufactures, which are greatly in request in Europe. Four crops of mulberry leaves are obtained from the same field in the course of each year. The best is in December.\n\nThe manufacture of indigo appears to have been known and practised in India from the earliest period. From this country, whence it derives its names, Europe was anciently supplied with it, until the produce of America engrossed the market. The spirited and persevering exertions of a few individuals, have restored this commerce to Bengal, solely by the superior quality of their manufactures; for so far as regards the culture, no material change has been made in the practice of the natives. The profit depends in a great measure on the quality of the\narticle, and this is very unequal since it varies according to the skill of the manufacturer. In 1807-8, the total manufacture of indigo, on a correct estimate, was not less than 120,000 factory maunds (8,880,000), of which probably 20,000 maunds were wasted or consumed in the country manufactures. The total quantity of indigo British property, which was sold at the East India Company's sales in 1810, amounted to the enormous weight of 5,253,489 pounds, and the sale price 1,942,328l.; but the average cannot be reckoned at more than 1,200,000l. annually, almost the whole being exported from Bengal. In 1786 the quantity sold at the Company's sales amounted to only 245,011 pounds.\n\nBengal, from its western boundary to the sea, is watered by the Ganges, and is intersected in every direction by many navigable streams, which fall into that river. There is no district wholly destitute of internal navigation during the rains; and, even during the driest season, there is scarcely any part 20 miles from a navigable river. In most of them, lakes, rivulets, and water-courses, communicating with great rivers, conduct boats to the peasant's door. But his valuable produce, being reaped at other seasons, and from necessity disposed of as soon as gathered, he derives less benefit from the inland water communication, than the survey of its extent would lead us to suppose. Land carriage conveys the greater part of produce from the place of its growth to that of its embarkation on the Ganges.\n\nThe internal navigation does nevertheless employ a vast number of vessels, and it is interesting to note, at a mart of great resort, the various construction of boats assembled there from different districts, each adapted to the nature of the rivers they generally traverse: the flat clinker-built vessels of the western district, would be ill adapted to the wide and stormy navigation of the Lower Ganges. The unwieldy bulk of the lofty boats used on the Ganges, from Patna to Calcutta, would not suit the rapid and shallow rivers of the western districts, nor the narrow creeks which the vessels pass in the eastern navigation; and the low but deep boats of these districts, are not adapted to the shoals of the western rivers.\n\nIn one navigation, wherein the vessels descend with the stream and return with the track rope, their construction consults neither aptitude for the sail, nor for the oar. In the other, wherein boats, during the progress of the same voyage, are assisted by the streams of one creek, and opposed by the current of the next, as in the Sunderbunds, and under banks impracticable for the track rope, their principal dependance is on the oar; for a winding course in narrow passages permits no reliance on the sail. Often grounding in the shallows, vessels would be unsafe if built with keels; and all Bengal constructions want this addition so necessary for sailing.\n\nThese vessels are cheaply found. A circular board, tied to a bamboo, forms the oar; a wooden frame, loaded with some weighty substance, is the anchor; a few bamboos lashed together supply the mast; a cane of the same species serves for a yard to the sail, which is made of coarse sackcloth; some from the twine, made of the fibrous stem of the rushy crotalaria, or of the hemp hibiscus. The trees of the country afford resin to pay the vessels, and a straw thatch with mats supply the place of a deck, to shelter the merchandize. The vessels are navigated with equal frugality; the boatmen receive little more than their food, which is most commonly furnished in grain, together with an inconsiderable allowance in money, for the purchase of salt, and for the supply of other petty wants. Thirty years ago in Major Rennel's valuable work, the whole number of boatmen employed on the rivers of Bengal and Bahar, were estimated at only 30,000; but probably some mistake must have oc-\ncurred in the calculation, as they certainly are at present much nearer 300,000. Besides this trade, most of them follow the petty occupations of agriculture, or fill up the intervals of their employments as fishermen, and occasionally augment the bands of dacoits or river pirates.\n\nIn the land carriage, the owners of cattle are also the principal traffickers, oftener purchasing at one market to sell at another, than letting their cattle to resident merchants. They transport the merchandize upon oxen trained to burden, sometimes but not frequently, upon horses of the tattoo breed and still more rarely on buffaloes. The latter, although more docile, are more sluggish and slower travellers than the ox; and do not bear a much greater burthen, although much larger in size. They are also too fond of lying down in the water, which they have so often occasion to wade through, with their loads.\n\nThe highways throughout Bengal are not generally in a condition for distant journeys on wheel carriages. At a former period the communication was better assisted. A magnificent road from the banks of the Goggrah or Dewah to the Brahmapootra, formed a safe and convenient communication at all seasons, in a length of 400 miles, through countries subject to annual inundation. Of the causeways and avenues which formed the road some remains may yet be traced. At present, the beaten path throughout Bengal directs the traveller, but no artificial road, or any other accommodation; and, in the rainy season, his progress by land is altogether barred. The total decay of the public roads must be ascribed to the want of substantial and durable materials for their construction. The Bengal government have completed a road from Calcutta to Benares, which was principally done with a view to the expediting of military movements; but has, at the same time, proved a very general convenience.\n\nThe exportation of grain from corn districts, and the returns of salt, constitute the principal object of internal trade. The importation of cotton from the western provinces, and the exchange of tobacco for betel nut, together with some sugar, and a few articles of less note, complete the supply of internal consumption. Piece goods, silk, saltpetre, opium, sugar, and indigo, formerly passed almost wholly through the Company's hands; but now all sorts of traffic are much more open, and practised generally by every description of merchant. Grain, the internal commerce of which is entirely conducted by the natives themselves, supplies the consumption of the cities, and the export trade of Bengal. Except in cities, the bulk of the people is everywhere subsisted from the produce of their immediate neighbourhood.\n\nPlain muslins, distinguished by their various names, according to the fineness or closeness of the texture, as well as flowered, striped, or checkered muslins, denominated from their patterns, are fabricated chiefly in the province of Dacea. The manufacture of the thinnest sort of fine muslins is almost confined to that province; other kinds, more closely wove, are fabricated on the western side of the Delta of the Ganges; and a different sort, distinguished by a more rigid texture, does not seem to be limited to any particular districts. Coarse muslins, in the shape of turbans, handkerchiefs, &c., are made almost in every province; and the northern parts of Benares afford both plain and flowered muslins, which are not ill adapted for common uses, though incapable of sustaining any competition with the beautiful and imitative fabrics of Dacea.\n\nUnder the general name of calicoes are included various sorts of cloth, to which no English names have been yet affixed; and are, for the\nmost part, known in Europe by the Indian denominations. Cosses (khasals) are fabricated in that part of Bengal which is situated north of Ganges; between the Mahanuddy and Isamutty rivers, from Maulda to Berbazie. Cloths, similar in quality, and bearing the same name, are made near Tanda in the Nabob of Oude's dominions. Battas are manufactured in the south-east corner of Bengal, near Luckipore; and again, on the western frontier of Bares, in the neighbourhood of Allahabad, and also in the province of Bahar, and some other districts. Sanaes are the chief fabric of Orissa; some are made in the district of Midnapoor; some are imported from the contiguous countries. A similar cloth, under the same denomination, is wrought in the eastern parts of the province of Benares. Gurraes are the manufacture of Birbhoon; still coarser cloths, named gezis and genizas, are wove in every district, but especially in the Doab of the Ganges and Jumna. Other sorts of cloth, the names of which are less familiar to the English reader, are found in various districts.\n\nPackthread is wove into sack-cloth in many places, and especially on the northern frontier of Bengal Proper, where it is employed as clothing by the mountaineers. A sort of canvass is made from cotton in the neighbourhood of Chittagong, Patna, and some other places; and blankets are made everywhere for common use. A coarse cotton cloth, dyed red, with cheap materials, is very generally used, and is chiefly manufactured in the centre of the Doab. Other sorts, died of various colours, but especially blue, are prepared for inland commerce, and exportation by sea. Both fine and coarse canvasses receive a topical dying with permanent and with fugitive colours, for common use, as well as for exportation. The province of Benares, the city of Patna, and the neighbourhood of Calcutta, are the principal seats of this manufacture of chintzes; which appears to be an original art in India, invented long since, and brought to a perfection not yet surpassed in Europe. Dimities, of various kinds, and damask linen, are now made at Dacca, Patna, Taunda, and other places.\n\nThe neighbourhood of Moorshebdabad, is the chief seat of the manufacture of wove silk and taleta, both plain and flowered. Tissues, brocades, and ornamented gauzes, are the manufacture of Benares. Plain gauzes, adapted to the uses of the country, are wove in the western and southern corner of Bengal. The weaving of mixed goods, made with silk and cotton, flourishes chiefly at Maulda, at Boglipoor, and at some towns in the district of Burdwan.\n\nA considerable quantity of filature silk is exported to the western parts of India; and much is sold at Mirzapoor, and passes thence to the Maharatta dominions, and the central parts of Hindostan.\n\nThe tisser, or wild silk, is procured in abundance from countries bordering on Bengal, and from some districts included within its limits. The wild silk-worms are there found in several sorts of trees, which are common in the forests of Silhet, Assam, and the Deccan. The cones are large, but sparingly covered with silky; and, in colour and lustre, this species of silk is far inferior to that of the domesticated insect. Its cheapness renders it useful, in the fabrication of coarse silks. The production of it may be increased by encouragement, and a very large quantity may be exported in the raw state, at a moderate expense. It might be used in Europe for the preparation of silk goods, and mixed with wool and cotton, might form, as it now does in India, a beautiful and acceptable manufacture. The manufacture of saltpetre scarcely passes the eastern limits of the Bahar province, under which head it will be found described.\n\nThe export of hides from Bengal might be greatly increased. It is\ncalculated that, including buffaloes, these provinces contain above 50 millions of cattle. Until recently the demand was so small, that the carrier often neglected to take the hide off the cattle that died a natural death. About 1797, some Europeans engaged in the tanning of leather, and manufacture of boots and shoes; which, although not so strong or water-proof as the British, answer so well, that they have greatly reduced the importation. The natives have also arrived at considerable perfection in the fabrication of saddles, harness, military accoutrements, and other articles of leather. Buffaloes horns might also become an article of export, although so bulky and difficult of stowage. An excellent species of canvas is now manufactured in Calcutta, and sold much cheaper than that imported from Europe.\n\nShould freight ever be reduced to the lowest price at which it can be afforded, corn might be exported from Bengal to Europe. Rice, barley, and wheat, may be shipped in Calcutta, for nearly the same price; namely, two and a half rupees per bag, containing two maunds, or from 3s. 4d. to 3s. 6d. per cwt. Rum might be exported from Bengal, at from 1s. 6d. to 1s. 9d. per gallon; the quality is as yet inferior to the Jamaicarum, but might be improved to equal it. Liquorice and ginger are produced in Bengal, and might be exported to any extent.\n\nIt is extremely probable that annatto, madder, coffee, cocoa, cochineal, and even tea, would thrive in British India, which now comprehends every variety of tropical climate. The plant from the seeds of which annatto is prepared, by separating the colouring matter which adheres to them, is already cultivated in Bengal, and coffee plants have thriven in botanical and private gardens. Madder is a native of the mountainous regions which border on Bengal, and this province possesses, besides many articles which might be brought into notice by a more extended commerce.\n\nVarious drugs used in dying are exported to England, such as galls, turmeric, safflower, or carthamus; also myrobalans, which are here used in preference to galls. Roots of morinda, which dye a permanent colour on cotton, and blossoms of the nectanches, which give a permanent colour to silk.\n\nGum arabic, and many other sorts of gums and resins for manufactures, are the produce of trees that grow spontaneously in Bengal, besides a multitude of medicinal gums and drugs which abound in India and the adjacent countries. Vegetable oils, particularly linseed, might be supplied from these provinces, which are also adapted for the cultivation of flax. Tincal, brought from the high table land of Tibet, is among the imports to Bengal; and vegetable and mineral alkalis may hereafter become a considerable object of commerce. The fossil alkali is found in abundance, and the woods of Bengal are capable of furnishing potash in large quantities. The preparation of sal ammoniac might be advantageously connected with the manufacture of saltpetre.\n\nBesides the articles already mentioned, which have a reference principally to Bengal, India furnishes aloes, assafoetida, benzoin, camphor, cardamums, cassia lignea, and cassia buds, arrangoes, couries, china root, cinnamon, cloves, cinnamon, nutmegs, mace, elephants' teeth, gums of various sorts, mother of pearl, pepper, (quicksilver and rhubarb from China), sago, scammony, senna, and saffron; and might supply anise, coriander, and cumin seeds, and many other objects which would occupy too much room to enumerate.\n\nOf hemp and flax, with all their varieties, and also of the different substitutes for these articles, Bengal possesses greater abundance than any other country. The true hemp is found in many places, but is little used by the natives, except for the\nseed oil, for medicine, and for an intoxicating ingredient which is often mixed with the tobacco of the Hoo-kah.\n\nFormerly the exports to Europe, and to the United States of America, constituted the most considerable portion of Bengal commerce.\n\nThe principal articles of export to Madras and the Coast of Coromandel are grain, pulse, sugar, saltpetre, molasses, ginger, long pepper, clarified butter, oil, silk, wrought and unwrought, muslins, spirits, and provisions.\n\nAfter the Coromandel trade, the next in importance is that of the eastward and China, to which quarters the exports, besides opium, consist of grain, saltpetre, gunpowder, iron firearms, cotton, silk, and cotton piece goods. The trade to Bombay is next, consisting chiefly of grain, sugar, raw silk, some silk and cotton piece goods, saltpetre, ginger, long pepper, sacking, and hempen ropes.\n\nTo the Gulfs of Arabia and Persia Bengal sends grain, sugar, silk, and cotton piece goods. To Ava and the Birman empire, silk and cotton goods, fire arms, iron, nails, naval and military stores, and a variety of European goods.\n\nBengal imports from Europe metals of all sorts, wrought and unwrought, woollens of various kinds, naval and military stores, gold and silver coin and bullion, and almost every article of Europe, for the European part of the inhabitants.\n\nThe returns from Madras and the Coast of Coromandel consist of salt, red wood, some fine long cloth, iza-nes, and chinizes. The balance due to Bengal is either settled by government bills, or remitted in specie. From the Eastern Islands, and the Malay Coast, Bengal receives pepper, tin, wax, dammer, brimstone, gold dust, specie, betel nut, spices, benzoin, &c. From China tutenagne, sugar-candy, tea, allum, dammer, porcelain, lacquered ware, and a variety of manufactured goods. From Manilla, indigo of a very fine quality, sugar, sapan wood, and specie.\n\nFrom the Malabar coast are imported sandal wood, coir rope, pepper, some cardamoms, and occasionally cargoes of cotton wool; the balance is general sunk in the annual supplies with which Bengal furnishes Bombay. From Pegue are brought teak timber, elephants' teeth, lac, &c. For a more detailed statement of the external commerce of Bengal see the article Calcutta.\n\nThe inhabitants of Bengal are certainly numerous in proportion to the tillage and manufactures that employ their industry. In 1789, the inhabitants of Bengal and Bahar were estimated at 22 millions, and Sir William Jones reckoned them at 24 millions. In 1793, Mr. Colebrooke was decidedly of opinion, after mature consideration, that, including Benares, they could not be estimated at less than 27 millions, which corroborates Sir Wm. Jones's calculation. Another estimate made in 1790, which is not so much to be depended on, carries the population of Bengal, Bahar, and Benares, so high as 32,987,500 inhabitants. In 1801 a more accurate survey than any of the preceding was taken by the directions of the Marquis Wellesley, but the result has never been communicated to the public in an authentic form. Upon the whole, the average of 200 to a square mile, in districts which are well peopled, may be admitted as tolerably correct; and we may estimate the total population of Bengal, Bahar, and Benares, not to exceed 30 millions, nor to fall short of 28 millions of inhabitants.\n\nUnder the British government the population of Bengal has undergone a progressive increase, which still continues, and surpasses that of England in the cultivated districts. It has occasionally, however, met with checks, as happened in 1770, when it is supposed, on a moderate computation, that a fifth of the inhabitants perished by famine; in\n1784 the same calamity prevailed, but in a much less degree; in 1787 many lives were lost in the eastern provinces by inundation, and in 1788 by a partial scarcity; but since this last period famine and scarcity have been wholly unknown. In 1793, it was reckoned that 4,000,000 maunds of salt, equal to 320,000,000 pounds of salt, were consumed in Bengal and Bahar, exclusive of Benares.\n\nIn 1793 the estimated produce of the lands in maunds of 80lbs. each was as follows, but the value affixed appears too high.\n\n| Produce                                      | Rupees     |\n|----------------------------------------------|------------|\n| 150,000,000 maunds of rice, wheat, and barley, at 12 annas | 112,500,030 |\n| 60,000,000 of millet, &c., at 8 annas         | 30,000,000  |\n| 90,000,000 of pulse, at 10 annas               | 56,250,000  |\n| 43,000,000 maunds of seed, reserved for the following season | 28,380,000 |\n| Oil seeds                                     | 12,000,000  |\n| Sugar, tobacco, cotton, &c.                   | 70,000,600   |\n| Sundries                                      | 20,000,000  |\n\nGross produce of land 329,130,000\n\nIn the revenue system of Bengal the ryot, or cultivator, is described as a tenant paying rent, and his superior as a landlord or landholder; but, strictly speaking, his payment heretofore was a contribution to the state, levied by officers named zemindars, standing between him and government. In the rule for dividing the crop, whether under special engagements, or by custom, their proportions are known, viz.\n\nHalf to the landlord and half to the tenant.\n\nOne-third to the landlord and two-thirds to the tenant.\n\nTwo-fifths to the landlord and three-fifths to the tenant.\n\nThe standard for the regulation of rates has been lost, but we learn from the observations on the revenues of Bengal by the late James Grant, Esq. that the assessment was limited not to exceed in the whole a fourth part of the actual gross produce of the soil. In early times the demands of the Hindoo sovereigns were more moderate. The Mahabharat states, that the prince was to levy a fiftieth of the produce of the mines, and a tenth of corn. Menu, and other legislators, authorize the sovereign to exact a tenth, an eighth, or a twelfth part of grain, according to circumstances, and a sixth of the clear annual produce of trees.\n\nWith respect to the much disputed nature of landed property in Bengal, in one point of view, the zemindars, as descendants of the ancient independent rajahs, seem to have been tributary princes. In another light they appeared only to be officers of government. Probably their real character partook of both. This, however, must be obviously restricted to rajahs who possessed great zemindaries. Numerous landholders subordinate to these, as well as others independent of them, cannot evidently be traced to a similar origin.\n\nThe zemindars are now acknowledged for various reasons, and from considerations of expediency which decided the question, as proprietors of the soil. Yet it has been admitted, from very high authority, that anciently the sovereign was the superior of the soil, that the zemindars were officers of revenue, justice, and police, and that their office was frequently, but not necessarily, hereditary. To collect and assess the contributions, regulated as they were by local customs, or particular agreements, but varying at the same time with the necessities of the state, was the business of the zemindar, as a permanent, if not as a hereditary officer. For the due execution of his charge, he was checked by permanent and hereditary officers of record and account.\n\nThe sayer revenue of the nature\nof land rent, consists of ground rent for the site of houses and gardens, revenue drawn from fruit trees, pastures and math, and rent of fisheries. Other articles of sayer collected within the village have been abolished; such, for example, as market tolls and personal taxes. Ground rents were not usually levied from ryots engaged in husbandry.\n\nA poll tax, called jaziye, was imposed by the Kalif Omar on all persons not of the Mahomedan faith. The Mussulman conquerors of Hindostan imposed it on the Hindoos as infidels, but it was abolished by the Emperor Acher. At a subsequent period Aurengzebe attempted to revive it, but without success.\n\nFree lands are distinguished according to their appropriations, for Brahmans, bards, encomiasts, ascetics, priests, and mendicants, or for a provision for several public officers. The greatest part of the present free lands of Bengal proper, were originally granted in small portions of waste ground. The more extensive tracts of free land are managed in the same mode as estates assessed for revenue.\n\nPrior to 1790 half the revenues of Bengal were paid by six large zemindaries, viz. Rajeshy, Burdwan, Dinagpoor, Nuddea, Birbhoom, and Calcutta.\n\nIn Bengal the class of needy proprietors of land is very numerous, but even the greatest landlords are not in a situation to allow that indulgence and accommodation to the tenants, which might be expected on viewing the extent of their income. Responsible to government for a tax originally calculated at ten-elevenths of the expected rents of their estates, they have no probable surplus above their expenditure to compensate for their risk. Any accident, any calamity, may involve a zemindar in difficulties from which no economy or attention can retrieve him. About 1790 the gross rent paid to the landholders in Bengal was estimated at nearly six crores of rupees, and the expenses of collection at 40 per cent.\n\nIn 1793 the territorial revenue, which had before fluctuated, was permanently and irrevocably fixed, during the administration of Lord Cornwallis, at a certain valuation of the property, moderately assessed; but this permanent settlement has not yet been introduced into the territories obtained by cession from the Nabob of Oude, or by conquest from the Maharattas. The mighty mass of papers which the agitation of this question introduced among the Company's records, proves the ability, labour, and anxiety, with which it was discussed.\n\nThe following are the particulars of the revenue and disbursements of the Bengal presidency in 1809.\n\n**REVENUES.**\n\n| Item                  | Amount     |\n|-----------------------|------------|\n| Mint                  | \u00a310,819    |\n| Post office           | 34,800     |\n| Oude and ceded provinces | 1,694,131 |\n| Land                  | 3,851,128  |\n| Judicial              | 104,831    |\n| Customs               | 516,509    |\n| Salt                  | 1,815,822  |\n| Opium                 | 594,978    |\n| Stamps                | 81,633     |\n| Conquered provinces   | 1,111,807  |\n\nTotal revenues \u00a39,816,458\n\n**CHARGES.**\n\n| Item                  | Amount     |\n|-----------------------|------------|\n| Mint                  | 33,955     |\n| Post office           | 31,690     |\n| Oude and ceded provinces | 409,320 |\n| Civil charges in general | 600,906 |\n| Supreme court and law | 46,400     |\n| Adawlets (courts of justice) | 546,567 |\n| Military              | 2,990,573  |\n| Marine                | 75,082     |\n| Buildings and fortifications | 34,800 |\n| Revenue               | 524,086    |\n| Customs               | 70,760     |\n| Salt advances and charges | 406,000 |\n| Opium ditto           | 100,920    |\n| Stamps                | 10,642     |\n| Conquered provinces   | 596,285    |\n| Interest of debt      | 1,421,933  |\n\nTotal charges 7,898,934\nIn 1809 the debt owing by the East India Company, at this presidency,\nAmounted to - - - 20,286,644\nThe amount of assets,\ndebts, &c. belonging to\nthe Company at the\nsame period was - 8,518,131\n\nExcess of debt above\nthe assets - \u00a311,768,515\n\nThe Company are also possessed\nof property to a considerable amount\nat this presidency, which, from not\nbeing considered as available, is not\ninserted among the assets. This\nproperty consists of plate, household\nfurniture, guns on the ramparts,\narms, and military stores. The build-\nings might be added, but their cost\nis supposed to be included in the\ncharges as well as the fortifications.\nThe whole, however, must have ori-\nginally been procured by advance of\nfunds either in England or India.\n\nIn 1810 the sum estimated to have\nbeen expended on buildings and for-\ntifications was - - - 5,494,354\nPlate, furniture, planta-\ntions, farms, vessels,\nstores, &c. - - - - 1,496,114\n\n\u00a36,990,468\n\nAmong the native population in\nthe eastern districts of Bengal, the\nMahommedans are almost equally\nnumerous with the Hindoos; in the\nmiddle part they do not constitute a\nfourth part of the population, to the\nwestward the disproportion is still\ngreater. As an average of the whole,\nthe Mahommedans may be com-\nputed at one-tenth of the popula-\ntion. Of the four great classes, the\naggregate of the Bramin, Khetri, and\nVaisya, may amount, at the most,\nto a fifth part of the total population.\nCommerce and agriculture are uni-\nversally permitted to all classes, and\nunder the general designation of ser-\nvants to the other three tribes, the\nSudras seem to be allowed to pro-\nsecute any manufacture. In this\ntribe are included not only the true\nSudras, but also the several castes,\nwhose origin is ascribed to the pro-\nmiscuous intercourse of the four\nclasses. In practice little attention\nis paid to the limitations of the castes,\ndaily observation shows even Brah-\nmins exercising the menial profes-\nsion of a sudra. Every caste forms\nitself into clubs and lodges, consist-\ning of several individuals of that caste\nresiding within a small distance.\nThese clubs govern themselves by\nparticular rules and customs, or by\nlaws. It may, however, be received\nas a general maxim, that the occu-\npation appointed for each tribe, is\nentitled merely to a preference;\nevery profession, with a few excep-\ntions, being open to every descrip-\ntion of persons.\n\nThe civil and military government\nof the territories under the Bengal\npresidency, is vested in a governor-\ngeneral and three counsellors. Va-\ncancies in the council are supplied\nby the directors, and the counsellors\nare taken from the civil servants of\nnot less than 12 years standing. For\nthe administration of justice through-\nout the provinces subject to the pre-\nsidency, there are in the civil and\ncriminal departments,\n\nOne supreme court stationed at\nCalcutta.\n\nSix courts of appeal and circuit\nattached to six different divisions.\n\nForty inferior courts, or rather\nmagistrates, stationed in so many\ndifferent districts and cities, viz.\n\nAgra Dacca Jelalpoor\nAllahabad Denagepoor\nAlyghur Etaweh\nBackergunge Furruckabad\nBareily Goracpoor\nBahar Hooghly\nBenares Jessone\nBirbhum Jionpoor\nBeghipoor (or Mong-Meerat)\nBurdwan [hir] Midnapoor\nCawnpoor Mirzapoor\nChittagong Mymunsingh\nBalasore Moorshedabad.\nJuggernauth Cuttack, Moradabad,\nand Bundelcund.\nThe courts of circuit consist of three judges, with an assistant; together with native officers, both Mahommedan and Hindoo. The judges make their circuits at stated periods of the year, and hold also regular and frequent jail deliveries. They try criminal offences according to the Mahommedan law; but when the sentence is capital, or imprisonment is awarded beyond a defined period, it does not take effect until it receives confirmation from the superior criminal court stationed in Calcutta, named the Nizamut Adawlet. The principal business of this court is to revise trials; but it is in no case permitted to aggravate the severity of the sentence.\n\nIn the country districts, the officer who, in his criminal capacity, has the appellation of magistrate, is also the civil judge of the city or district in which he resides. He tries all suits of a civil nature, provided the cause of action have originated, the property concerned be situated, or the defendant be resident, within his jurisdiction. To try suits of a small limited amount, the judge may appoint native commissioners, from whose decisions an appeal lies to the judge. With a few exceptions, the decisions of the judge are appealable to the provincial courts of appeal, within the jurisdiction of which he resides.\n\nThe ultimate court of appeal, in civil matters, sits in the city of Calcutta, and is styled the Sudder Dewanny Adawlet. To this court all causes respecting personal property beyond 5000 rupees value are appealable; with regard to real property, it is ascertained by certain rules, differing according to the nature and tenure of the property. From this court an appeal lies to the king in council, if the value of the property concerned amounts to 5000l. sterling.\n\nUnder the Mahommedan governments, suitors pleaded their own causes, and the practice continued until 1793, when regular native advocates were appointed. These advocates are chosen out of the Mahommedan College at Calcutta, and Hindoo College at Benares, and the rate of fees is fixed by public regulation. This institution ensures suitors against negligence or misconduct on the part, either of the judge, or of his native assistant, the advocates being often as conversant in the business of the court as either of those officers. As an ultimate security for the purity of justice, provisions have been made against the corruption of those who administer it. The receiving of a sum of money, or other valuable as a gift, or present, or under colour thereof, by a British subject in the service of the Company, is deemed to be taken by extortion, and is a misdemeanor at law.\n\nWritten pleadings have been introduced in the native languages, for the purpose of bringing litigation to a point, and enforcing, in legal proceedings, as much precision as the habits of the people will admit. Before this, the charge and defence consisted of confused oral complaints, loudly urged on one side, and as loudly retorted on the other. In receiving evidence, great indulgence is granted to the scruples of caste, and the prejudices against the public appearance of females, so prevalent in eastern countries.\n\nThe Mahommedan law still continues, as the British found it, the ground work of the criminal jurisprudence of the country. In civil matters, the Hindoos and Mahommedans substantially enjoy their respective usages. The prejudices of both are treated with indulgence, and the respect which Asiatic manners enjoins to women of rank is scrupulously enforced.\n\nThe body of servants, who fill the\ncommercial, political, financial, and judicial officers in Bengal, are supplied by annual recruits of young men, under the appellation of writers, who generally leave England for India about the age of 18. When they have completed three years residence in the country, they are eligible to an office of 500l. per annum, emoluments upwards; after six years, to 1500l. upwards; after nine years, to 3000l. upwards; and after twelve years, to 4000l. per annum, or upwards. The directors of the Company generally appoint annually about 30 writers for the civil service. In 1811, the number of civil servants in Bengal was 391; under the Madras presidency, 206; and under that of Bombay, 74;\u2014in all, 671.\n\nThe pay, allowances, and emoluments of the civil service in Bengal, including European uncovenanted assistants, amounted, in 1811, to 1,045,400l. sterling.\n\nThe stations of the commercial residents, for purchasing the investment for the Company, are,\n\n| Bareily | Keerpooy |\n|---------|----------|\n| Bauliah | Luckipore and Chittagong |\n| Commercolly | Maulda |\n| Cossimbazar | Midnapoor |\n| Dacca | Patna |\n| Etaweh | Radnagore |\n| G\u00f3lagore | Rungpoor |\n| Gorapoor | Santipoor |\n| Hurrial | Soonamooky |\n| Hurripaul | Jungeypoor |\n\nThe collectors of the government customs are stationed at\n\n| Benares | Furruckabad |\n|---------|-------------|\n| Calcutta | Hooghly |\n| Cawnpoor | Moorshedabad |\n| Dacca | Patna |\n\nThe diplomatic residents are at Delhi, Hyderabadd, Lucknow, Mysore, Nagpoor, Poonah, and with Dowlet Row Sindia, who seldom stays long in one place.\n\nThe native, or sepoy troops, under the three presidencies, including the non-commissioned officers, who are also natives, amount to 122,000 men; of whom about 2000 are cavalry, equally divided between Madras and Bengal. European officers, attached to this force, are nearly 3000. Of European regiments, each presidency is furnished with one, besides artillery and engineers; and the total number of these troops, with their officers, exceeds 4000. The officers rise by seniority.\n\nIt has become usual for the British government at home to send to India a certain number of regiments from the army of his majesty, which are for the time placed at the disposal of the Company, and co-operate with the army immediately subject to that body. About 22,000 king's troops are now usually stationed in India, at the entire expense of the Company. The commander-in-chief in both king's and Company's forces is usually the same person, nominated both by the king and by the Company to the command of their respective armies, and acting by virtue of a commission from each. In 1811, the total number of king's troops in India was 21,488; the expense 1,154,695l. per annum; and the Company's Bengal army, of all descriptions of regulars, was 58,690 men.\n\nThe annual appointment of cadets for the three presidencies may be averaged at 120 for the military, and 10 for the marine service, annually. In 1811, the number of officers in the Company's service, on the Bengal establishment, was 1571; the pay and allowances amounted to 872,088l. per annum. The number of resident Europeans out of the service, in the provinces under the Bengal presidency, Calcutta included, in 1810, were computed at 2000.\n\nThe districts into which, in modern times, the province of Bengal has been subdivided, are Backergunge, Birbhoon, Burdwan, Chittagong, Hooghly, Jessore, Mymunsingh, Moorshedabad, Nuddea, Purneah, Ranjeshy, Rungpoor, Silhet, Tipperah, the 24 pargunnahs, and to which, from its long connexion,\nmust be added Midnapoor, although it properly belongs to Orissa.\n\nWithin these limits are comprehended three very large cities: Calcutta, Moorshedabad, and Dacca; and many prosperous inland trading towns, of from 10 to 20,000 inhabitants, such as Hooghly, Boguangola, Narrainungee, Cossimbazar, Nuddea, Maulda, Mungulhaunt, &c. The small villages, of from 100 to 500 inhabitants, are beyond number, and in some parts of the country seem to touch each other as in China. While passing them by the inland navigation, it is pleasing to view the cheerful bustle and crowded population by land and water; men, old women, children, birds, and beasts, all mixed and intimate,\" evincing a sense of security and appearance of happiness, seen in no part of India beyond the Company's territories. Nor have the natives of Bengal any real evils to complain of, except such as originate from their own litigious dispositions, and from the occasional predatory visits of gang-robbers. To secure them from the last, the exertions of government, and of their servants in the magistracy, have been most strenuous; neither pains nor expense have been spared: but, it must be confessed, hitherto without the desired success, and partly owing to the want of energy in the natives themselves. With respect to the first, the Bengalese are, from some characteristic peculiarity, particularly prone to legal disputations; and, politically pacific, seem socially and domestically martial. Among them wars seem frittered down into law, and the ferocious passions dwarfed down to the bickering and snarling of the hut and village.\n\nIn this province there are many female zemindars, generally subservient to, and under the management of, the family Brahmin, who controls their consciences. This person has his own private interests to attend to, and without appearing, exerts an influence over the public business. The ostensible managing agent submits to the control of a concealed authority, which he must conciliate; and the interests of the state and zemindar equally bend to it. A Brahmin in Bengal not only obtains a lease of land on better terms, but has exemptions from various impositions and extortions to which the inferior classes are exposed.\n\nBeyond Bengal the natives of the northern mountains prove, by their features, a Tartar origin. They people the northern boundary of Bengal.\n\nOn the eastern hills, and in the adjacent plains, the peculiar features of the inhabitants shew with equal certainty a distinct origin; and the elevated tract which Bengal includes on the west, is peopled from a stock obviously distinct, or rather by several races of mountaineers, the probable aborigines of the country. The latter are most evidently distinguished by their religion, character, language, and manners, as well as by their features, from the Hindoo nation. Under various denominations they people the vast mountainous tract which occupies the centre of India, and some tribes of them have not yet emerged from the savage state.\n\nIn the mixed population of the middle districts, the Hindoos may be easily distinguished from the Mahomedans. Among the latter may be discriminated the Mogul, the Afghan, and their immediate descendants, from the naturalized Musselmans. Among the Hindoos may be recognized the peculiar traits of a Bengalese, contrasted with those of the Hindostany. The native Bengalese are generally stigmatized as pusillanimous and cowardly; but it should not be forgotten, that at an early period of our military history in India, they almost entirely formed several of our battalions, and distinguished themselves as brave and active soldiers. It must, however, be acknowledged, that throughout Hindostan the Bengalese name has\nnever been held in any repute; and that the descendants of foreigners, settled in Bengal, are fond of tracing their origin to the countries of their ancestors.\n\nThe men of opulence now in Bengal are the Hindoo merchants, bankers, and banyans of Calcutta, with a few at the principal provincial stations. The greatest men formerly were the Mahommedan rulers, whom the British have superseded, and the Hindoo zemindars. These two classes are now reduced to poverty, and the lower classes look up to the official servants and domestics of the English gentlemen. No native has any motive to distinguish himself greatly in the army, as he cannot rise higher than a soubahdar, a rank inferior to an ensign.\n\nSlavery, in its severest sense, is not known in Bengal. Throughout some districts the labours of husbandry is executed chiefly by bond servants. In certain other districts the ploughmen are mostly slaves of the peasants, for whom they labour, but are treated by their masters more like hereditary servants, or emancipated bonds, than like purchased slaves. Though the fact must be admitted, that slaves may be found in Bengal among the labourers in husbandry, yet in most parts none but free men are occupied in the business of agriculture.\n\nMany tribes of Hindoos, and even some Brahmins, have no objections to the use of animal food, beef excepted. At their entertainments it is generally introduced; by some it is daily eaten; and the institutes of their religion require, that flesh should be tasted even by Brahmins at solemn sacrifices; forbidding, however, the use of it, unless joined with the performance of such a sacrifice. Dr. Leyden was inclined to think, that anthropophagy, was practised by a class of mendicants, named Agora Pun'th, in Bengal and other parts of India.\n\nOf the existence of Bengal as a separate kingdom, with the limits assigned to it at present, there is no other evidence than its distinct language and peculiar written character. At the time of the war of the Mahabharat, it constituted three kingdoms. Afterwards it formed part of the empire of Magadha, or Bihar, from which, however, it was dismembered before the Mahommedan invasion. The last Hindoo prince of this province was named Laesmanuyah, and held his court at Nuddea. A.D. 1203, during the reign of Cuttub ud Deen, on the Delhi throne, Mahommed Bukhtyar Khilijee was dispatched by that sovereign to invade Bengal, and marched with such rapidity, that he surprised and captured the capital, and expelled Rajah Lachsmayyah, who retired to Juggernaut, where he had the satisfaction of dying.\u2014The Mohammedan general then proceeded to Gour, where he established his capital, and reared his mosques on the ruins of Hindoo temples.\u2014According to Mahommedan testimonies, this large province was completely subdued in the course of one year.\n\nFrom this period Bengal was ruled by governors delegated by the Delhi sovereigns until 1340, when Fakher ud Deen, having assassinated his master, revolted, and erected an independent monarchy in Bengal. After a short reign he was defeated and put to death, and was succeeded by\n\nA.D.\n\n1343 Ilyas Khanje.\n1358 Secunder Shah; killed in an engagement with his son,\n1367 Gyas ud Deen. He eradicated the eyes of his brothers.\n1373 Sultan Assulateen.\n1383 Shams ud Deen; defeated and killed in battle by\n1385 Raja Cansa, who ascended the throne, and was succeeded by his son,\n1392 Chietmull Jellal ud Deen, who became a convert to the Mahommedan religion.\n1409 Ahmed Khan, who sent an em-\nBENGAL.\n\nA.D. bassy to Shah Rokh, the son of Timour.\n\n1426 Nassir Shad; succeeded by his son,\n\n1457 Barbek Shah. This prince introduced mercenary guards and forces, composed of negro and Abyssinian slaves.\n\n1474 Yuseph Shah, son of the last monarch, succeeded by his uncle,\n\n1482 Futteh Shah, murdered by his eunuchs and Abyssinian slaves; on which event one of the eunuchs seized the crown, and assumed the name of\n\n1491 Shah Zadeh; but after a reign of eight months, he was assassinated, and the vacant throne taken possession of by\n\n1491 Feroze Shah Hebshy, an Abyssinian slave, succeeded by his son,\n\n1494 Mahmood Shah, murdered by his vizier, an Abyssinian, who ascended the throne under the name of\n\n1495 Muzaffer Shah, a cruel tyrant, slain in battle.\n\n1499 Seid Hossein Shah. This prince expelled the Abyssinian troops, who retired to the Deccan and Gujrat, where they afterwards became conspicuous under the appellation of Siddees. He also invaded Camroop and Assam, but was repulsed with disgrace. He was succeeded by his son,\n\n1520 Nusserit Shah, who was assassinated by his eunuchs, and his son Ferose Shah placed on the throne; but, after a reign of three months, he was assassinated also by his uncle.\n\n1533 Mahmood Shah was expelled by Shere Shah the Afghan, and with him, in 1538, ended the series of independent monarchs of Bengal. Some Portuguese ships had entered the Ganges so early as\n\n1517; and in 1536 a squadron of nine ships, was sent to the assistance of Mahmood Shah; but these succours arrived too late, and Bengal once more became an appendage to the throne of Delhi.\n\nShere Shah and his successors occupied Bengal until 1576, when it was conquered by the generals of the Emperor Ameer; and in 1580 formed into a soubah, or vice-royalty, of the Mogul empire, by Raja Tooder Mull.\n\nThe governors of Bengal, under the Mogul dynasty, were\n\nA.D.\n\n1576 Khan Jehan.\n1579 Muzaffir Khan.\n1580 Rajah Tooder Mull.\n1582 Khan Azim.\n1584 Shahbaz Khan.\n1589 Rajah Mansingh.\n1606 Cuttab ud Deen Kokultash.\n1607 Jehangire Cooey.\n1608 Sheikh Islam Khan.\n1613 Cossim Khan.\n1618 Ibrahim Khan.\n1622 Shah Jehan.\n1625 Khanezad Khan.\n1626 Mokurrem Khan.\n1627 Fedai Khan.\n1628 Cossim Khan Jobung.\n1632 Azim Khan. During the government of this viceroy, A.D. 1634, the English obtained permission to trade with their ships to Bengal, in consequence of a firman from the Emperor Shah Jehan; but were restricted to the port of Pipley, where they established their factory.\n\n1639 Sultan Shujah, the second son of Shah Jehan, and brother of Aurengzebi. In 1642, Mr. Day, the agent, who had so successfully established the settlement at Madras, proceeded on a voyage of experiment to Balasore; from\nwhence he sent the first regular dispatch, received by the Court of Directors from Bengal, recommending a factory at Balasore. In 1656, owing to the extortion and oppression which the Company experienced, their factories were withdrawn from Bengal.\n\n1660 Meer Jumla.\n1664 Shaista Khan. During the government of this viceroy, the French and Danes established themselves in Bengal. He expelled the Mughals of Arracan from the Island of Sundeeep; and his administration was in other respects able and active, although described by the East India Company's agents of that period in the blackest colours.\n\n1677 Tedai Khan.\n1578 Sultan Mahommed Azim, the 3d son of Aurengzebi.\n1680 Shaista Khan was re-appointed. This year Mr. Job Charnock was restored to his situation of chief at Cossimbazar; and, in 1681, Bengal was constituted a distant agency from fort St. George or Madras. On the 20th December, 1686, in consequence of a rupture with the Fouladar, or native military officer of Hooghly, the agent and council retired to Chattanuttce or Calcutta, from Hooghly, considering the first as a safer station.\n\n1689 Ibrahim Khan. In 1693 Mr. Job Charnock died, and was succeeded by Mr. Eyre; the seat of the Company's trade continuing at Chattanuttce. In 1693 Sir John Goldesborough was sent out as general superintendent and commissary of all the Company's possessions; but he died in Bengal in 1794, having confirmed Mr. Eyre as chief. In 1696, during the rebellion of Soobha Singh, the Dutch at Chinsura; the French at Chandanagore; and the English at Chattanuttce (Calcutta), requested permission to put their factories in a state of defence. The viceroy having assented in general terms, they proceeded with great diligence to raise walls, bastions, and regular fortifications; the first suffered by the Moguls, within their dominions.\n\n1697 Azim Ushaun, grandson to Aurengzebe. This prince in 1700 permitted the agents of the East India Company, in consideration of a valuable present, to purchase three towns with the lands adjacent to their fortified factory, viz. Chattanuttce, Gorindpoor, and Calcutta. Mr. Eyre, the chief, in consequence of instructions from home, having strengthened the works of the fort, it was denominated Fort William, in compliment to the king.\n\n1704 Moorshud Cooly, or Jaffier Khan. This nabob, in 1704, transferred the seat of government from Daccato Moorshedabad, as being more central. The annual surplus revenue, during his administration, amounted to from 130 to 150 lacks of rupees (1,500,000l.), and was regularly transmitted to Delhi every February, accompanied by valuable presents. In 1706 the whole stock of the united East India Company had been removed to Calcutta; where the garrison consisted of 129 soldiers, of whom 66 were Europeans, exclusive of the gunner and his crew.\n\n1725 Shujah ud Deen, son-in-law of the last governor. He was succeeded by his son.\n\n1739 Serferaz Khan, who was de-\nthroned and killed in battle by Ali Verdy Khan. It does not appear, that this nabob ever remitted any part of the revenue to Delhi. After the invasion of Hindostan, by Ahmed Shah Abdalli in 1746, and the death of the Emperor Mahommed Shah in the following year, the Mogul empire may be considered as wholly at an end, beyond the immediate vicinity of the city of Delhi.\n\nSeraje ud Dowlah, grandson to the late nabob, in April this year, took undisputed possession of the three provinces; but, it does not appear, he even received or applied for investure from Delhi. On the 20th June, he captured Calcutta, and shut the prisoners, 146, in a room 20 feet square, where they all perished except 23. On the 1st January, 1757, Calcutta was retaken from him by Admiral Watson and Colonel Clive; on the 20th June, he was defeated at Plassey, and the beginning of next July was assassinated by order of the son of his successor, in the 20th year of his age, and 15th month of his government. For the subsequent native princes of Bengal, see the article Moorshe-dabad.\n\nFrom this era may be dated the commencement of the British government in Bengal, although the dewanny was not obtained until 1765, when Lord Clive procured it from the Emperor Shah Alam, upon the condition of paying him 26 lacks of rupees per annum, besides securing him a considerable territory in Upper Hindostan; both of which he subsequently forfeited in 1771, by putting himself in the power of the Maharattas. This important business (the acquisition of the dewanny), observes a native historian, was settled without hesitation or argument, as easily as the purchase of an ass or any other animal, without envoys or reference, either to the King of England or to the Company.\n\nLord Clive returned to England in 1767, and was succeeded by Mr. Verelet and Cartier. In 1772 Mr. Hastings was appointed governor, and continued until 1785; when he was succeeded by Sir John Macpherson, who administered the affairs of government, until the arrival of Lord Cornwallis in 1787.\n\nDuring his lordship's government, which lasted until August, 1793, the land revenue was permanently settled, a code of regulations enacted, and the army and magistracy new modelled; which improvements were prosecuted by his successor, Lord Teignmouth, and completed by the Marquis Wellesley. This nobleman reached India the 26th April, 1798, and left Madras for England the 26th August, 1805.\n\nThe Marquis Cornwallis arrived at Calcutta, on his second mission in July, 1805, and died at Ghazipoor, near Benares, the 5th of next October. He was succeeded by Sir George II. Barlow, who continued at the head of the supreme government, until the arrival of Lord Minto, in July, 1807. Lord Minto returned to Europe in 1813, and was succeeded as governor general by the Earl of Monb, who still fills that important station. (Colebrooke, Stewart, R. Grant, Tennant, J. Grant, Lambert, Bruce, Lord Teignmouth, Sir Henry Strachey, Milburn.\u2014Edinburgh Review, &c.)\n\nBENGAL, BAY OF.\u2014This portion of the Indian Ocean has the figure of an equilateral triangle, very much resembling in shape, though larger in size, than that formed by the continent of the Deccan and south of India, and usually, but improperly denominated the Peninsula. On the west, one limb extends from Bengal to Ceylon; on the east, from Bengal to Junkseylon; and the third, across\nthe bay from Ceylon to Junkseylon. Each limb may be estimated at 1120 miles in length, and the whole is comprehended within the latitudes of 8\u00b0 and 20\u00b0 north. At the bottom of the bay, the difference of longitude between the towns of Balazore and Chittagong on the opposite sides, 4\u00b0 53'.\n\nThe west coast of the Bay of Bengal is inhospitable for shipping, there being no harbour for large ships; but the opposite coast affords many excellent harbours, such as Arracan, Che-duba, Negrais, and Syriam in Pegue, a harbour near Martaban, Tavoy River, King's Island, and several harbours in the Mergui Archipelago, besides Junkseylon, Telebone, and Pula Lada. In other respects the two coasts differ materially. Coromandel has no soundings about 30 miles from the shore; the east coast has soundings two degrees off. Coromandel is comparatively a clear country; the east coast of the bay is covered with wood. Coromandel is often parched with heat, from winds blowing over barren sand; the east coast is always cool. On the west coast, the mouths of the rivers are barred with sand; on the east coast, they are deep and muddy. Coromandel has often destructive gales; the east coast has seldom any.\n\nThe numerous rivers that open on the coast of the bay, bring down such quantities of slime and mud, that the sea appears turbid at a great distance from the shore. In these parts, the tides and currents run with great velocity; and when counter currents meet, a rippling is formed, extending several miles in a straightline, attended with a noise resembling breakers.\n\nThe winds in the Bay of Bengal are said to blow six months from the N. E. and the other six from the S. W. This is not precisely the case, but is sufficiently accurate for general purposes. It is remarkable, that in many parts of India, during March and April, there are on shore strong winds blowing directly from the sea; while in the offing it is a perfect calm. Thus at Bengal, there are in that season very strong southerly winds, while in the bay, calms prevail until May and June. On the coast of Malabar, the south-west monsoon does not commence blowing with strength until the beginning of the rainy season; but, on shore, there are strong westerly winds from about the vernal equinox.\n\nIn the Hindoo Puranas by the term Calinga is understood the sea coast at the summit of the bay of Bengal, from Point Godavery to Cape Negrais. It is divided into three parts.\u2014Calinga Proper, which extends from Point Godavery to the western branch of the Ganges. The inhabitants of this country are called Calingi, by Aelian and Pliny. 2dly, Madhya Calinga, or the Middle Calinga, which is in the Delta of the Ganges, and is corruptly called Medo Galinea by Pliny. 3dly, Moga Calinga extends from the eastern branch of the Ganges to Cape Negrais, in the country of the Mias or Muggs; this is the Macco Calingae of Pliny. The name Calinga implies a country abounding with creeks, and is equally applicable to the sea shore about the mouths of the Indus. (Forrest, Wilford, Johnson, Rennel, F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nBengermow.\u2014A town in the Nabob of Oude's territories, district of Lucknow, 43 miles E. from Lucknow. Lat. 36\u00b0 53' N. Long. 80\u00b0 13' E. This town is situated on a small river, is surrounded with clumps of mango trees, and has the appearance of having been formerly much more considerable.\n\nBeore.\u2014A district in the Nizam's dominions, in the province of Aurungabad, situated about the 19th degree of north latitude. It is a very hilly district, and has not any river of consequence. The chief town is Beore, and there are besides several strong holds.\n\nBeore.\u2014A town in the Nizam's\nBERAR.\n\nA large province in the Deccan, extending from the 19th to the 22d degrees of north latitude. To the north, it is bounded by Khandesh and Allahabad; to the south by Aurungabad and the Godaverry; to the east by the province of Gundwana; and to the west by Khandesh and Aurungabad. Its limits are very inaccurately defined; but, including the modern small province of Nandere, which properly belongs to it, the length may be estimated at 230 miles, by 120 miles the average breadth. In the Institutes of Aeber, compiled by Abul Fazel, A.D. 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"The ancient names of this Sonbah are Durdatut, Ruddavoodyt, and Fittkener. It is situated in the second climate. The length from Putaleh to Beiragurh is 200 coss, and the breadth from Bunder to Hindiah, measures 180 coss. On the east it joins to Beeragurgh; on the north is Settarah; on the south Hindia; and on the west Tilingana. It is divided into the following districts; viz. 1. Kaweel; 2. Poonar; 3. Kehrleh; 4. Nernalah; 5. Kullem; 6. Bassum; 7. Mahore; 8. Manickdurg; 9. Patna; 10. Tilinganch; 11. Ramgur; 12. Bhcker; 13. Pullyaleh.\"\n\nIt will be perceived, that the province of Berar, described by Abul Fazel, differs considerably from the modern acceptation of the name; the latter including (but improperly) the whole country between Dowletabad and Orissa, the eastern part of which was certainly not reduced by, and probably not known to the Emperor Aeber. Nagpoor has generally been supposed to be the capital of Berar; but this is a mistake, as it is in the province of Gundwana; Ellichpoor being the proper capital of this country. The sonbah of Berar was formed during the reign of Aeber, from conquests made south of the Nerbuddah; but the eastern parts were probably never completely subjugated.\n\nThis province is centrically situated in the Deccan, nearly at an equal distance from the two seas. The surface is in general elevated and hilly, and abounds in strong holds; some of which, such as Gaweighur, were deemed impregnable by the natives, until taken by the army under General Wellesley. It has many rivers, the principal of which are the Godaverry, Truptee, Poornah, Wurda, and Katina, besides smaller streams. Although so well supplied with water, it is but little cultivated, and thinly inhabited. There are some parts of the province, however, which are so favoured by climate and soil, as to be as well cultivated as any part of India, producing rice, wheat, barley, cotton, opium, silk (in small quantities and coarse), and sugar\u2014and the whole is susceptible of great improvement. The Berar bullocks are reckoned the best in the Deccan. The principal towns are Ellichpoor, Gaweighur, Narnallah, Poonar, Nandere, and Patery.\n\nAt present three-fourths of the province are included within the territories of the Nizam, and the remainder is either occupied by, or tributary to the Nagpoor and Malwah Maharattas. By the treaty of peace concluded with the Nagpoor Rajah, in December, 1803, the River Wurda was declared the boundary betwixt his dominions and those of the Nizam. From various causes this province has never attained to any great population, the inhabitants probably not exceeding two millions, of which number not more than one-tenth are Mahomedans, the rest being Hindoos of the Brahminical sect. A singular practice prevails among the lowest tribes of the inhabitants of Berar and Gundwana.\nSuicide is not unfrequently vowed by such persons in return for boons, solicited from idols. To fulfil his vow, the successful votary throws himself from a precipice called Cailabhairava, situated in the mountains between Tuptee and Nerbuddah rivers. The annual fair held near that spot, at the beginning of each spring, usually witnesses eight or ten victims of this superstition.\n\nAmong the states which arose out of the ruins of the Bhamence sovereigns of the Deccan, A.D. 1510, one consisted of the southern part of Berar, named the Ummad Shahy dynasty. It was so called from the founder Ummad ul Mookh, and lasted only through four generations. The last Prince Borralian Ummad Shah, was only nominal sovereign; the power being usurped by his minister Tuffal Khau. He was reduced by Motiza Nizam Shah, who added Berar to the other dominions of Ahmednuggur in 1574, and along with the latter sovereignty Berar fell under the Mogul domination, towards the end of the 17th century. (Abul Fazel, Rennel, Ferishta, Colebrooke, Leckie, 5th Register, &c.)\n\nBereng,(Varanga)\u2014A small central district in the province of Cashmere, situated about 34\u00b0. 30\u2032. N.

Near this town is a long strait in a mountain, in which there is a reservoir of water seven ells square, which the Hindoos consider as a place of great sanctity.

Long. 113\u00b0. 50\u2032. E. The surrounding country is an immense plain of rice fields interspersed with thickets. The village of Besouki is the capital of a small Malay principality; the chief, or tomogon, of which, in 1804, was of a superior description as a native, possessing some knowledge of mathematics and physics, although of Chinese origin. His palace is built of large white stones, in the European manner, having in front an extensive court, with a wooden gate. (Tombe, &c.)\n\nBesseer.\u2014A district in Northern Hindostan, situated about the 32d degree of north latitude. It is intersected by the Jumna, and bounded on the east by the Ganges, with the province of Lahore on the west. It has been but little explored, except by the Goorkhali armics, it being tributary to the Nepaul government.\n\nBessely Ghaut, (Bisaweli-ghat).\u2014A pass through the western range of mountains, leading from the Mysore into the maritime province of Canara. This road has been formed with great labour out of a bed of loose rock, over which the torrents run during the rains with such force, as to wash away all the softer parts; and, in many parts, leaving single rocks four or five feet in diameter, standing in the centre of the road, not above two feet asunder. The trees in the vicinity are of an enormous size, several of them being 100 feet in the stem, without a branch to that height. The descent is very steep, yet it is often travelled at night by torch light, which has a very grand effect among the trees and precipices. By this pass numerous flocks of oxen descend to the sea coast with grain, and return with salt. (Lord Valentia, &c.)\n\nBetaisor.\u2014A town in the province of Agra, situated on the S.W. side of the Jumna, 37 miles S.S.E.\nfrom Agra, Lat. 26\u00b0. 58'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 28'. E.\n\nBettiah, (Bhattia, named also Chumparun).\u2014A district in the province of Bahar, situated between the 27th and 28th degrees of north latitude. It is bounded on the north by the Terriani, on the east by Mocwanny and Tirhoot, and on the west by the River Gunduck. This district was not completely subdued until the acquisition of the dewanny by the Company, when it was annexed to Chumparun; and, together, they contain, in their greatest extent, 2546 square miles.\n\nThe chief towns are Bettiah and Boggah, and the principal river the Gunduck; on the banks of which, and indeed all over the district, large timber trees for ship building are procured, and firs fit for masts. In cultivation and manufactures it is much inferior to the more central districts of Bahar, a considerable proportion of the country still remaining covered with primeval forests. (J. Grant, Verelst, &c.)\n\nBettiah.\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, district of Bettiah, 90 miles N. N. W. from Patna, Lat. 26\u00b0. 47'. N. Long. 84\u00b0. 40'. E.\n\nBettooriah, (Bhitoria).\u2014A district in the province of Bengal, situated principally betwixt the 24th and 25th degrees of north latitude, and now comprehended, with its capital Nattore, in the larger division of Rajeshy. The principal river is the Ganges, but it is cut and intersected, in all directions, by smaller rivers, nullahs, and water courses; and has, besides, large internal jeels or lakes, which, in the height of the rains, join and form one vast sheet of water, interspersed with trees and villages built on artificial mounds. It is fertile, and well adapted for the rice cultivation, of which grain it produces, and exports large quantities. A.D. 1386, Rajah Cansa, the Hindoo zemindar of this district, rebelled against Shums nd Deen, the sovereign of Bengal, who was defeated and slain. On this event Raja Cansa ascended the vacant throne, which, after a reign of seven years, he transmitted to his son Cheetnul, who became a Mahomedan, and reigned under the name of Sultan Jellal nd Deen.\n\nBetwah, (Vetava).\u2014This river, from its source south of Bopal in the province of Malwah, to its confluence with the Junna below Calpee, describes a course of 340 miles in a north-easterly direction. Near the town of Barwah, in the month of March, it is about three furlongs broad, sandy, and full of round stones, and the water only knee deep; but, during the rains, it swells to such a height as to be impassable. (Hunter, &c.)\n\nBeyah, (Vipasa).\u2014This river rises in the province of Lahore, near the mountains of Cashmere, and not far from the source of the Sutuleje, which it afterwards joins. For the first 200 miles its course is due south, after which it pursues a westerly direction. The whole length of its present journey may be estimated at 350 miles; it appears, however, that it formerly fell into the Sutuleje, much below the place where they now meet, there being still a small canal, called the Old Bed of the Beyah. Abul Fazel writes, that the source of the Beyah, named Abyakoond, is in the mountains of Keloo, in the pargannah of Sultanpoor.\n\nThis is the fourth river of the Punjab, and is the Hyphasis of Alexander, after its junction with the Sutuleje, about the middle of its course. In 1805 Lord Lake pursued Jeswunt Row Holkar to the banks of this river, where he at last sued for peace. (Reynell, Malcolm, Abul Fazel, &c.)\n\nBeyhar, (Vihar).\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Coos Beyhar, situated on the east side of the Toresha River. Lat. 26\u00b0. 18'. N. Long. 89\u00b0. 22'. E.\n\nBeykaneer.\u2014See Bicanere.\n\nBezoara, (Bijora).\u2014A town in the Northern Circars, district of Condapilly, situated on the east bank\nof the Krishna river. Lat. 16\u00b0. 32'. N. Long. 80\u00b0. 27'. N.\n\nBhadrinath, (Vadranatha.)\u2014A town and temple in Northern Hindostan, in the province of Serinagur, situated on the west bank of the Alacananda River, in the centre of a valley, about four miles in length, and one mile in its greatest breadth. Lat. 30\u00b0. 43'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 38'. E.\n\nThis town is built on the sloping bank of the river, and contains only 20 or 30 huts, for the accommodation of the Brahmins and other attendants on the temple. The structure of this edifice is by no means answerable to the reputed sanctity of the place; for the support of which large sums are annually received, independent of the land revenue appropriated for its maintenance. It is built in the form of a cone, with a small cupola, surmounted by a square shelving roof of copper, over which is a golden ball (gilt) and spire. The height of the building is 40 or 50 feet, and the era of its foundation too remote to have reached us even by tradition; it is, consequently, supposed to be the work of some superior being. This specimen of Hindu divine architecture, however, was too weak to resist the shock of the last earthquake, which left it in so tottering a condition, that human efforts were judged expedient to preserve it from ruin.\n\nHere is a warm bath, supplied by a spring of hot water that issues from the mountain, with a thick steam strongly tainted with a sulphureous smell. Close to it is a cold spring. Besides these there are numerous other springs, having their peculiar names and virtues, which are turned to a good account by the Brahmins. In going the round of purification, the poor pilgrim finds his purse lessen as his sins decrease; and the numerous tolls that are levied on this high road to paradise, may induce him to think that the straightest path is not the cheapest.\n\nThe principal idol, Bhadrinath, is about three feet high, cut in black stone or marble, dressed in a suit of gold and silver brocade, the head and hands only being uncovered. His temple has more beneficed lands attached to it than any sacred Hindu establishment in this part of India. It is said to possess 700 villages, situated in different parts of Gerwal or Kemaoon, which are all under the jurisdiction of the high priest, who holds a paramount authority, nominally independent of the ruling power.\n\nThe selection for the office of high priest is confined to the casts of Deccan Brahmins, of the Chauli or Namburi tribes. In former times the situation was a permanent one; but since the Nepaulese conquest, the pontificate is put up to sale, and disposed of to the highest bidder.\u2014The territorial revenue probably forms the least part of the riches of this establishment; for every person who pays his homage to the deity is expected to make offerings in proportion to his means. In return for these oblations, each person receives what is called a presad, which consists of a little boiled rice, which is distributed with a due regard to the amount of the offerings.\n\nA large establishment of servants of every description is kept up; and, during the months of pilgrimage, the deity is well clothed, and fares sumptuously; but, as soon as the winter commences, the priests take their departure, until the periodical return of the holy season. The treasures and valuable utensils are buried in a vault under the temple, which was once robbed by a few mountaineers, who were afterwards discovered, and put to death. The Brahmins who reside here are chiefly from the Deccan, and do not colonise.\n\nThe number of pilgrims who visit Bhadrinath annually is estimated at 50,000, the greater part being fakirs (devotees), who come from the remotest quarters of India. All these people assemble at Hurdwar, and, as soon as the fair is concluded,\ntake their departure for the holy land.\n\nOn the 29th of May, 1808, masses of snow, about 70 feet thick, still remained undissolved on the road to Bhadrimath; and the tops of the high mountains were covered with snow, which remains congealed throughout the whole year. (Raper, &c.)\n\n**BHAGMUTTY,** *(Bhagamati).*\u2014The mountain of Sheopori, near Catmandoo, bordering the Nepaul valley, gives rise to the Bhagmutty and Bishenmutty rivers. The sources of the first (which also bears the name of Brintha Scassuti) are situated on the north side of the mountain, round the east foot of which the river winds, and enters the valley of Nepaul. A short distance below Catmandoo, the Bishenmutty joins it, and loses its name. The course of the Bhagmutty from thence, until it passes Hurreepoor, is unknown; it afterwards continues its course to Munniary, where it enters the Company's territories, and falls into the Ganges a few miles below Monghir. Its course, including the windings, may be estimated at 400 miles.\n\nThis river is navigable during the rains for boats of all burthens, as high as Seriva in the Nepaul territories, and probably much further up.

E.\n\n**BHAREH,** or **BHARRAGHARRY.**\u2014A town in Northern Hindostan, in the dominions of Nepaul, which, although the ordinary residence of the Soulah of the Western Turrye, is a mean place, containing only from 30 to 40 huts. Lat. 26\u00b0. 50'. N. Long. 85\u00b0. 25'. E. The fort is not more respectable than the town; nor would the governor's habitation attract notice anywhere else, although built of well-burned bricks and tiles.\n\nThe situation of Bhareh is very unhealthy; and Capt. Kinloch's detachment, which remained here for some time after the unfortunate attempt in 1739 to penetrate into Nepaul, suffered greatly from the pestilential effect of the climate. (Kirkpatrick, &c.)\n\n**Bhatgan,** or **Bhatgong.**\u2014A town in Northern Hindostan, situated in the valley of Nepaul. Lat. 27\u00b0. 32'. N. Long. 85\u00b0. 45'. E.\n\nBhatgong lies east by south of Catmandoo, distant nearly eight road miles. Its ancient name was Dhurmaputten, and it is called by the Newars Khopodaise, who describe it as resembling the dumbroo, or guitar of Mahadeva. This town is the favourite residence of the Brahmans of Nepaul, containing many more families of that order than Catmandoo and Patn together; all those of the khetri cast (military) flocking to the capital, while Patn is chiefly inhabited by Newars.\n\nIn size it is the most considerable of the three, being rated only at 12,000 houses; yet its palace, and the buildings in general, are of a more striking appearance, owing chiefly to the excellent quality of the bricks, which are the best in Nepaul\u2014a country remarkable for the superiority of its bricks and tiles. The former sovereigns of this state possessed the smallest share of the valley; but their dominions extended a considerable way eastward to the banks of the Coosey. Bhatgong is the Benares of the Ghorokhali dominions, and is said to contain many valuable ancient sanscrit manuscripts. (Kirkpatrick, &c.)\n\n**Bhatgong.**\u2014See Bhatgan.\n\n**Bhattia.**\u2014A town in the western extremity of the Gujrat Peninsula, situated a few miles to the east of Oaka.\n\nThis place contains about 500 houses, chiefly inhabited by Ahcers, an industrious and useful class of the\npeasantry, originally herdsmen, but who of late years have applied themselves to the cultivation of land.\u2014The country to the north of Bhattia exhibits an appearance of cultivation and prosperity superior in general to the rest of the peninsula. The grain chiefly raised is bajeree. (M'Murdo, &c.)\n\n**Bhavani River.**\u2014A river in the Coimbatore province, which flows past the town of Satinmugalum, and afterwards joins the Cavery at Bhawani Kudal.\n\n**Bhawani Kudal.**\u2014An old ruinous fort in the Coimbatore district, situated at the junction of the Bhawani with the Cavery. Lat. 11\u00b0. 25'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 47'. E.\n\nThis place contains two celebrated temples; the one dedicated to Vishnu, and the other to Siva, and was built by a polygar, named Guttimodaly, who held all the neighbouring countries as a feudatory under the rajahs of Madura. At that period the dominions of the latter, including Salien, Trechinopoly, and all the country south of Sholia or Tanjore, were called by the general title of Angaraca, and comprehended the two countries of Chera and Pandava.\n\nAt Apogadal, 10 miles from this place, a sandy loam is reckoned most favourable for the cultivation of rice; and, according to its four qualities, lets for 4l. 2s., 3l. 12s., and 3l. 4s. per acre. Inferior soils let so low as 18s. per acre. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\n**Bheels, (Bhaile).**\u2014A savage tribe, scattered over Hindostan Proper and the north of the Deccan, particularly along the course of the Nerbadatta River. They are a jungle people, and in a state of great barbarity. They are used by the Maharat-tas as guides, and travel with a bow and arrows, subsisting by rapine and plunder. The Bheels are supposed to have been the aborigines of Gujrat and the adjacent quarters of Hindostan, in common with the Coolies. The first now inhabit the interior, and live on what they can procure by hunting and thieving; the latter are generally found in the western districts of Gujrat, and along the sea shores, where they employ themselves in fishing and piracy.\n\nThe whole range of mountains from Songhur (a frontier town belonging to the Guikar), to its south limits, is in the possession of the Bheels.

Long. 77\u00b0 28' E.\n\nThe Rajah of Bhurtpoor is one of the principal chieftains of the tribe of Jauts, and possesses a considerable territory and several forts in the vicinity of Agra and Mathura, on the south-west or right bank of the Jumna.\n\nThe tribe of Jauts for the first time attracted notice in Hindostan about the year 1700, when having migrated from the banks of the Indus, in the lower part of the province of Mooltan, they were allowed to settle in the avocations of husbandry in several parts of the Doab of the Ganges and Jumna. Their subsequent progress was uncommonly rapid; and during the civil wars, carried on by the successors of Aurengzebe, the Jauts found means to secure themselves a large portion of country, in which they built forts, and accumulated great wealth. The title of rajah is a Hindoo distinction, which some of them have assumed; but to which they have no more real right, than their ancestors had to the contents of the imperial caravans, which they were in the habit of plundering.\n\nDuring Aurengzebe's last march towards the Deccan, Churamun, the Jaut, pillaged the baggage of the army, and with part of the spoil erected the fortress of Bhurtpoor. Sooraj Mull, one of his successors, new modelled the government, and was afterwards killed in battle with Nudjiff Khan, A.D. 1763. He was succeeded by his son, Jewar Singh, who was secretly murdered in 1768. At this period the Jaut territories extended from Agra to within a few miles of Delhi on the west, and to near Etaweh on the east. They also possessed a tract of land south of the Jumna; and, besides places of inferior strength, had three forts, which were then deemed impregnable. About 1780, Nudjiff Khan subdued great part of the Jaut country, and left the rajah little besides Bhurtpoor, and a small district of about seven lacks of rupees per ann.\n\nOn the death of Jewar Singh, in 1768, his brother, Ruttan Singh, ascended the throne; and, being also assassinated, was succeeded by his brother, Kairy Singh. On the death of this chief, his son, Runjeet Singh, assumed the sovereignty, in possession of which he still continues.\u2014When Madajee Sindia first undertook the conquest of Hindostan Proper, he experienced essential assistance from Runjeet Singh, who, on this account, was treated with great comparative lenity by the Maharattas.\n\nIn September, 1803, a treaty of perpetual friendship was concluded by General Lake, on the part of the British government, with Rajah Runjeet Singh, of Bhurtpoor, by which the friends and enemies of the one state were to be considered the friends and enemies of the other; and the British government engaged never to interfere in the concerns of the rajah's country, or demand tribute from him. The rajah, on the other hand, engaged, that if an enemy invaded the British territories, he would assist with his forces to compel his expulsion; and, in like manner, the British government undertook to assist the Bhurtpoor rajah in defending his dominions against external attacks.\n\nNotwithstanding this treaty, concluded in the most solemn manner, and with all the customary formalities, in 1805, the rajah most unaccountably embraced the declining cause of Jeswant Row Holkar, repeatedly discomfited by Lord Lake, and admitted him with the shattered remains of his army into the fortress of Bhurtpoor. The consequence was, a siege commenced, which will be memorable in the annals of India,\nfor the sanguinary obstinacy both of the attack and defence. The garrison repulsed with vast slaughter the most desperate assaults of the besiegers, who, from the breadth and deepness of the wet ditch, never could get in sufficient numbers to close quarters, although a few, half-swimming, half wading, did reach and ascend the ramparts, but only to be tumbled back into the ditch.\n\nIn the course of this siege the British sustained a greater loss of men and officers, than they had suffered in any three of the greatest pitched battles they had fought in India; but the rajah perceiving that the British perseverance must ultimately prevail, sued for peace, sent his son to Lord Lake's camp with the keys of the fortress, and agreed to compel Holkar to quit Bhurtpoor.\n\nOn the 17th of April, 1805, the siege being thus concluded, a second treaty was arranged, by which the former conditions of friendship were renewed, but with stipulations calculated to ensure a stricter performance of them on the part of the rajah, who agreed, that, as a security, one of his sons should constantly remain with the officer commanding the British forces in Upper Hindostan, until such time as the British government should be perfectly satisfied in regard to the rajah's fidelity; upon the establishment of which they agreed to restore to him the fortress of Deeg.\n\nIn consideration of the peace granted, the rajah bound himself to pay the British government 20 lacks of rupees, five to be paid immediately, and the remainder by instalments. In consequence of the pacification, the country before possessed by the rajah was restored to him, and he engaged to assist the British against all invaders, and not to receive any Europeans into his service. As by the second article of the treaty the British government became guarantee to the rajah for the security of his country against external enemies, it was agreed, that in case a misunderstanding arose between him and any other chief, he would, in the first instance, submit the cause of dispute to the British government, which would endeavour to settle it amicably; but if, from the obstinacy of the opposite party, this was unattainable, the rajah was authorized to demand aid from the British government.\n\nThe extent of the rajah's territories has never been accurately defined, but they contain no town of consequence besides Bhurtpoor, Biana, and Deeg, which last was restored to him. At present he appears to be cordially attached to the British government, and really sensible of the important protection afforded him by the treaties subsisting with that state; as a proof of which, he permitted, and even invited, the British officer who was surveying that part of Hindostan, in 1806, to survey his territories also. (Marquis Wellesley, Hunter, Franklin, Crawford, Treaties, MSS. &c.)\n\nBiana, (Byana).\u2014A town in the province of Agra, 44 miles W. S. W. from the city of Agra. Lat. 26\u00b0. 56'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 16'. E.\n\nThis town preceded Agra as the capital of the province, as we learn from Abul Fazel that Sultan Secunder Lodhi made it his metropolis, and kept his court here, while Agra was a village dependent on it. It was first conquered by the Mahommedans in 1197. Biana is still considerable, and contains many large stone houses, and the whole ridge of the hill is covered with the remains of buildings, among which is a fort, containing a high pillar, conspicuous at a great distance. In 1790 the town and district belonged to Ranjeet Singh, the Rajah of Bhurtpoor, and with him it probably still remains. (Abul Fazel, Hunter, &c.)\n\nBicanere, (Bicanir).\u2014A large district in the province of Ajmeer, situated about the 29th degree of north latitude. It is bounded on the north by the country of the Batties,\nwest by the desert, S. W. by Jesselmere, south by Joudpoor, S. E. by Jeypoor, and east by the district of Hurriana.\n\nThe country is elevated, and the soil a light brown sand, from the nature of which the rain is absorbed as soon as it falls. Wells are, consequently, of absolute necessity, and are made of brick, generally from 100 to 200 feet deep. Each family has, besides, a cistern for the collection of rain water. With the exception of a few villages towards the eastern frontier, the cultivation of Bicanere is precarious; bejurah, and other species of Indian pulse, being the only produce, the inhabitants depending greatly on the neighbouring provinces for a supply of provisions. Horses and bullocks, of an inferior breed, are raised, and are nearly the sole export.\n\nThis district imports coarse and fine rice, sugar, opium, and indigo. The former articles are brought from Lahore by Rajghur and Churoo. Salt is procured from Sambher, and wheat from the Jeypoor country; spices, copper, and coarse cloth, from Jesselmere. The chief place of strength is the city of Bicanere. Churoo, Rangcham, and Bahndra, are reckoned strong places by the natives, but they are ill supplied with water. The country being an extensive level plain, contains few natural strong holds, or fortified places. To cross the Desert of Bicanere requires a march of 11 days.\n\nThe country is governed by the Rhatore Rajpoots, but the cultivators are mostly Jauts. In 1582, this district was described by Abul Fazel as follows: \"Sircar Beykaneer, containing 11 mahals, revenue 4,750,000 dams. This sircar furnishes 1200 cavalry, and 50,000 infantry.\" (Thomas, Franklin, &c.)\n\nBicanere.\u2014A town in the province of Ajmere, the capital of a district of the same name, 220 miles W. by N. from Delhi.\n\nThis city is spacious, well built, and surrounded by a wall of Conker. On the south west side is the fort, where the rajah resides. It is a place of considerable strength, built in the Indian style, and encompassed by a broad and deep ditch; but the chief security of both the city and fort, arises from the scarcity of water in the surrounding country.\n\nIn the service of the Bicanere Rajah are several Europeans of different nations, who reside within the fort. The Batties and this rajah are generally in a state of hostility; and, in Nov. 1808, the city and fort were blockaded by the Rajah of Jondpoor and his allies. (Thomas, 11th Register, &c.)\n\nBickut.\u2014A town tributary to the Maharattas, in the province of Agra, district of Narwar, 40 miles east from the city of Narwar. Lat. 23\u00b0. 43'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 52'. E.\n\nBidzegur, (Vijayaghar).\u2014A town in the province of Allahabad, district of Chunar. Lat. 24\u00b0. 37'. N. Long. 83\u00b0. 10'. E.\n\nThe fort is a circumvallation of a rocky hill, measuring from the immediate base to the summit about two miles. Its strength consists in the height and steepness of the hill, and the unhealthy nature of the surrounding country. Three deep reservoirs, excavated on the top of the hill, supplied the garrison with water. It was taken by the British forces in 1781, during the revolt of Cheit Singh, and has ever since been neglected, and in ruins. Travelling distance from Benares 56 miles. (Foster, Rennel, &c.)\n\nBijanagur, (Vidymagar).\u2014A city in the Balaghaut Ceded Territories, in the south of India, now in ruins, but once the capital of a great Hindu empire. Lat. 15\u00b0. 14'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 34'. E.\n\nThe remains of this city are situated on the south bank of the Toombuddra River, directly opposite to Annagoondy. On the north side of Comlapoor fort are a great number of rugged hills, covered with pagodas. The city has been enclosed with strong stone walls on the\neast side, and bounded by the river on the west, the circumference of the whole appearing to be about eight miles. Betwixt the immense piles of rocks crowned with pagodas, several streets can be traced from 30 to 45 yards wide, and there is one remains yet perfect. There are a number of streams flow through the ruins of the city, which is named by the natives on the spot Allpatna. The river at one place, at the foot of these ruins, is only 16 yards wide, below which there has been a stone bridge. Annagoondy, which was formerly only a part of the city, is now the Canarese name for the whole.\n\nThe building of this metropolis was begun A.D. 1336, and finished in 1343, by Aka Hurryhur, and Bucca Hurryhur, two brothers, the former of whom reigned until A.D. 1350, and the latter until 1378. It was at first named Vidyanganara, the city of science, but was afterwards named Vijayanagara, the city of victory.\n\nThe Chola (Tanjore), the Chera, and the Pandian (Madura) dynasties were all conquered by Nursing Rajah, and Krishna Rajah of Bijanagur, in the period between 1490 and 1515. The kingdom was then called Bisnagar, and Narsinga, in old European maps, and comprehended the whole Carnatic above and below the Ghauts; when visited by Cesar Frederic, who described the city as having a circuit of 24 miles, and containing within its walls many hills and pagodas.\n\nA state of incessant hostility subsisted between the Mahommedan sovereigns of the Deccan, and this Hindoo principality; notwithstanding which we learn from Ferishta, that Rajah Deo Ray, of Bijanagur, about 1440, received Mahommedans into his service, and erected a mosque for them in his capital, commanding that no person should molest them in the exercise of their religion. He had 2000 soldiers of this religion in his army, fighting against the Bhameece Mahommedan princes of the Deccan. At that era they were reckoned more expert bowmen than the Hindoos.\n\nIn 1564 the four Mahommedan Deccany Kings of Ahmednuggur, Bejapoor, Golconda, and Beeder, combined, and totally defeated Ram Rajah, the sovereign of Bijanagur, on the plains of Tellicotta, and afterwards marched to the metropolis, which they plundered and sacked. The city was depopulated by the consequence of this victory, and deserted by the successor of Ram Rajah, who endeavoured to re-establish at Pennaconda, the ruins of a once powerful dynasty. About 1663 the Sree Rung Rayeel, or Royal House of Bijanagur, appears to have become extinct, as we hear no more of it after that period. For the history of the nominal rajahs who followed, see the article Annagoondy. The latter are said for many years to have kept an exact register of the revolutions in the Deccan and south of India, in the vain hope of being, by some future turn of the wheel, reinstated in their ancient rights.\n\nTravelling distance from Madras, 386, from Seringapatam, 260, from Calcutta, 1120, from Delhi, 1106, and from Hyderabad, 264 miles.

It was taken, in 1803, by the British forces, after considerable resistance by the zemindar.\n\nBijore, (Bajawer).\u2014A small Afghan district in the province of Kabul, situated about the 34th degree of north latitude, and comprehended within the division of Sewad. Abul Fazel, in 1582, describes it as follows:\n\n\"Bijore is in length 25, and in breadth from five to 10 coss. On the east lies Sewad, on the north Kinore and Cashghur, on the south Bickram, and on the west Guznoorgul. The air of this district re...\"\nsembles that of Sewad, excepting that the heat and cold are rather more severely felt here. It has only three roads; one leading to Hindostan, called Danishcote, and two that go to Cabul; one of which is named Summej, and the other Guznoorgul. Danishcote is the best road. Adjoining to Bijore, and confined by the mountains of Cabul and Sinde, is a desert, measuring in length 30 coss, and in breadth 25 coss.\"\n\nThis district contains eight extensive vallies, of which Rod is the largest. It is only partially possessed by the Yusefzei tribe, many portions being occupied by the Mohmand, Sahi, Shinwan, and Turcalani tribes.

It is possessed by independent zemindars; but, although so near to the coun-\n\ntries being occupied by the British, very little is known respecting it.\n\nBilsah, (Bilvesa).\u2014A town belonging to Dowlerow Sindia, in the province of Malwah, situated on the Betwah River, which takes its rise from a large tank near Bopal. Lat. 23\u00b0. 33'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 50'. E.\n\nThe town, or fort of Bhilsah, is enclosed with a stone wall, furnished with square towers, and a ditch. The suburbs without the walls are not very extensive, but the streets are spacious, and contain some good houses. This place is situated nearly on the S. W. extremity of the district, where it is contiguous to that of Bopal. The town and surrounding country are celebrated all over India for the excellent quality of the tobacco, which is bought up with great eagerness and exported. The country is open, and well cultivated. To the eastward of the town, at the distance of six furlongs, is a high and steep rock, on the top of which is a durgah, consecrated to the memory of a Mahommedan saint, named Jelal ud Deen Bokhari. It was first conquered by the Mahommmedans about 1230, and again in 1292.\n\nTravelling distance from Oojain, 140 miles, from Nagpoor, 249, from Benares, 416, from Calcutta, by Mundlak, 867 miles.

In length it may be estimated at 35 miles, by 18 the average breadth. The chief town is Rehio, or Rio, a port of considerable trade. This island is surrounded by numberless small rocky isles and islets, which render the navigation intricate and dangerous.\n\n**BIRBOOM, (Virabhumi, the Land of Heroes).\u2014** A district in the province of Bengal, situated about the 24th degree of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by Monghir and Rajemal; to the south by Burdwan and Pachete; to the east it has Ranjishy; and to the west Monghir and Pachete. By Abul Fazel it is named Madarun. In 1784 the superficial extent comprehended 3,858 square miles, a considerable proportion of which is hilly, jungly, and but thinly inhabited. The revenue was then 611,321 rupees. The Adji is the chief navigable river, and this district is, on the whole, one of the worst off in the province, with respect to water carriage. The agriculture and population are inferior to the more eastern parts of Bengal, and the principal manufacture is that species of calicoes named gurras. The chief towns are Surool, Sooro, and Nagore.\n\nBirboom is the largest Mahommedan zemindary in Bengal, and was originally conferred on Assud Ullah, father of Budder ul Zemaun, of the Afghan or Patan tribe, who was allowed to settle here about the time of Shere Shah, for the political purpose of guarding the frontiers of the west against the incursions of the barbarous Hindoos of Jehareund. A warlike Mahommedan militia were entertained as a standing army, with suitable territorial allotments under a principal landholder of the same faith. In some respects it corresponded with the ancient military chiefs of Europe, certain lands being exempted from rent, and appropriated solely to the maintenance of troops. This privilege was resumed by Cossim Ali in 1763, and is now still more unnecessary.\n\nIn 1801, by the directions of the Marquis Wellesley, then governor-general, the board of revenue circulated various queries to the collectors of the different districts on statistical subjects. The result of their replies proved that the district of Birbhoon contained 700,000 in the proportion of one Mahommedan to 30 Hindoos, and that any lands advertised for sale readily met with purchasers.

The mountains to the northward on each side rise to a stupendous height, and nearly meet at their base, leaving only a passage of 40 or 50 feet for the current of water, which is obstructed by large masses of rock. The Alacananda, above this confluence, is called the Vishnu Ganga, from its flowing near the feet of Vishnu at Bhadrinath. It comes from the north, and is in breadth from 25 to 30 yards, with a rapid stream.

This zemindary appears to be one of the most ancient estates in the province; for, by an era peculiar to itself, it must have been in the possession of the present proprietor's family through a course of 1099 years; during which period they were nearly independent, paying only a small tribute to the sovereign until 1715, during Jaffier Khan's administration, when the country was completely reduced.

Long. 83\u00b0. 26'. E.\n\nIn 1757 the first in rank of the polygars of this country was Rangaroo of Bobilee. His fort stood about 60 miles N.E. of Vizagapataam, close to the mountains; the dependent district being about 20 square miles. There had long been a deadly hatred betwixt this polygar and Vizeram Ranze, an adjacent polygar, whose person, how much soever he feared his power, Rangaroo held in the utmost contempt, as of low extraction, and of new note. Vizeram Rauze persuaded the French commander M. Bussy, to espouse his side of the quarrel; and the latter not foreseeing the terrible event to which he was proceeding, determined to reduce the whole country, and to expel the polygar and his family.\n\nA polygar, besides his other towns and forts, has always one situated in the most difficult part of his country; which is intended for the last refuge for himself, and all his blood. The singular construction of this fort is adequate to all the intentions of defence, among a people unused to cannon, or the means of battery. Its outline is a regular square, which rarely exceeds 200 yards; a round tower is raised at each of the angles, and a square projection in the middle of each of the sides. The height of the wall is generally 22 feet; but the rampart within only 12, which is likewise its breadth at the top, although it is laid much broader at the bottom. The whole is of tempered clay raised in distinct layers, of which each is left exposed to the sun, until thoroughly hardened before the next is applied. The parapet rises 10 feet above the rampart, and is only three feet thick. It is indented five feet down from the top in interstices six inches wide, which are three feet asunder. A foot above the bottom of these interstices and battlements runs a line of round holes, another two feet lower, and a third two feet from the rampart. These holes are usually formed with pipes of baked clay, and serve for the employment of firearms, arrows, and lances. The interstices are for the freer use of these arms, instead of loop holes, which cannot be inserted or cut in the clay.\n\nThe towers and the square projection in the middle, have the same parapet as the rest of the wall; and in two of the projections in the opposite sides of the fort are gateways, of which the entrance is not in front, but on one side, from whence it is continued through half the mass, and then turns by a right angle into the place. On any alarm, the whole passage is\nchoked up with trees; and the outside surrounded, to some distance, with a strong bed of thick brambles. The rampart and parapet is covered by a shed of strong thatch, supported by posts; the eves of this shed project over the battlement. This shed affords shelter to those on the rampart, and guards it against the sun and rain. An area of 500 yards or more, in every direction round the fort, is preserved clear, of which the circumference joins the high wood, which is kept thick, three or four miles in breadth, around this centre. Few of these forts permit more than one path through the woods. The entrance of the path from without, is defended by a wall exactly similar in construction and strength, to one of the sides of the fort; having its round towers at the ends, and the square projection in the middle.\n\nFrom natural sagacity, they never raise this redoubt on the edge of the wood, but at the bottom of a recess cleared on purpose; and on each side of the recess, raise a breast-work of earth or hedge to gall the approach. The path admits only three men abreast, winds continually, and is everywhere commanded by breast-works in the thicket; and has in its course several redoubts similar to that of the entrance, and like that flanked by breast-works on each hand. Such were the defences of Bobilce, which are given at length as a general specimen of all polygar forts; against which M. Bussy marched with 750 Europeans, of whom 250 were horse, four field pieces, and 11,000 peons and sepoys, the army of Vizeram Rauze, who commanded them in person.\n\nThe attack commenced at break of day, on the 24th January, 1757, with the field pieces against the four towers; and by nine o'clock, several of the battlements were broken. All the leading parties of the four divisions then advanced at the same time with scaling ladders; but, after much endeavour for an hour, not a man had been able to get on the parapet, and many had fallen wounded. Other parties followed with little success, until all were so fatigued, that a cessation was ordered; during which the field pieces, having beaten down more of the parapet, gave the second attack greater advantage; but the ardour of the defence increased with the danger. The garrison fought with the indignant ferocity of wild beasts, defending their dens and families; several of them stood as in defiance on the top of the battlements, and endeavoured to grapple with the first ascendants, hoping with them to twist the ladders down, and this failing, stabbed with their lances; but being wholly exposed, were easily shot by aim from the rear of the escalade. The assailants admired, for no Europeans had seen such excess of courage in the natives of Hindostan, and continually offered quarter, which was always answered by menace and intention of death; not a man had gained the rampart at two in the afternoon, when another cessation of attack ensued. On this Rangaroo assembled the principal men, and told them there was no hopes of maintaining the fort; and that it was immediately necessary to preserve their wives and children from the violation of the Europeans, and the still more ignominious authority of Vizeram Rauze.\n\nA number, called without distinction, were allotted to the work. They proceeded every man with his lance, a torch, and his poinard, to the habitations in the middle of the fort; to which they set fire indiscriminately, plying the flame with straw prepared with tutch or brimstone; and every man stabbed without remorse, the woman or child, which soever attempted to escape the flame and suffocation. The massacre being finished, those who accomplished it, returned like men agitated by the furies, to die themselves on the walls.\n\nMr Law, who commanded one of\nthe divisions, observed, while looking at the conflagration, that the number of defenders was considerably diminished, and advanced again to the attack. After several ladders had failed, a few grenadiers got over the parapet, and maintained their footing in the tower, until more secured the possession. Rangaroo, hastening to the defence of the tower, was killed by a musket-ball. His fall increased the desperation of his friends, who crowding to revenge his death, left other parts of the rampart bare. The other divisions of the French troops having advanced, numbers on all sides got over the parapet without opposition; nevertheless none of the defenders quitted the rampart, or would accept quarter, but each advancing against or struggling with an antagonist, would resign his poniard only with death.\n\nThe slaughter of the conflict being over, another much more dreadful presented itself in the area below. The transport of victory lost all its joy; all gazed on each other with silent astonishment and remorse, and the fiercest could not refuse a tear to the destruction spread before them. Four of the soldiers of Rangaroo on seeing him fall, concealed themselves in an unfrequented part of the fort, until the night was far advanced; when they dropped down from the walls, and speaking the same language, passed unsuspected through the quarters of Vizcram Rauze. They concealed themselves in the thicket, and the third night after, two of them crawled into the tent of Vizcram Rauze, and stabbed him in 32 places, and were immediately cut to pieces. Had they failed, the other two remaining in the forest, were bound by the same oath to perform the deed or perish in the attempt.

It is situated about the 24th degree of north latitude, and is bounded on the west by the British territories in Bundelcund, and to the east by the small district of Manwas. The Soane is the principal river, and the chief town is Rewah, where an independent rajah resides.\n\nThe produce of the country is wheat, barley, and different kinds of peas, and the inhabitants possess large flocks of cattle and sheep; the land, however, is but little cultivated, the natives scarcely raising grain enough for their own subsistence. Except Rewah, there is no town that deserves the name; and the country is occupied by many petty independent rajahs, who carry on an incessant predatory warfare with each other; nor are there any remains found to indicate a former and superior state of civilization.\n\nBoglipoor, (Bhagelpoor).\u2014A district in the province of Bahar, now comprehended in that of Monghir, to which it sometimes communicates its name. It is nearly equally divided by the Gauges, and originally contained 2817 square miles. It is well supplied with water and fertile; the weaving of mixed goods made with silk and cotton, flourishes in the town of Boglipoor, and the adjacent country.\n\nNear Gogamallah, one stage from Boglipoor, is a monument resembling a pagoda, erected to the memory of Mr. Cleveland, by the ef-\nBOMBAY.\n\nA city and island on the west coast of India, formerly comprehended in the province of Aurangabad, but now the principal British settlement on the west coast of India. Lat. 18\u00b0.58'. N. Long. 72\u00b0.38'. E.\n\nBombay is about 10 miles in length, by three the average breadth, and has now lost all pretensions to its insular name; as, in 1805, Mr. Duncan completed a causeway, or vellard, at Sion, across the narrow arm of the sea, which separated it from the contiguous island of Salsette, an operation of infinite service to the farmers and gardeners who supply the Bombay market, but which is said to have had a prejudicial effect on the harbour.\n\nThe fortifications of Bombay have been improved; but are esteemed too extensive, and would require a numerous garrison. Towards the sea they are extremely strong, but to the land side do not offer the same resistance; and to an enemy landed, and capable of making regular approaches, it must surrender. The town within the walls was begun by the Portuguese; and even those houses that have since been built are of a similar construction, with wooden pillars supporting wooden verandahs; the consequence of which is, that Bombay bears no external resemblance to the other two residences. The government house is a handsome building, with several good apartments; but it has the great inconvenience, of the largest apartment on both floors being a passage-room to the others.\n\nThe northern part of the fort is inhabited by Parsee families, who are not remarkably cleanly in their do-\n\nofficers and zemindars of the Junglerry of Rajmahal, who, prior to his time, were a race of savages, and whom, by conciliating measures, he induced to place themselves under the protection of the British government. A corps of 300 of these natives have been taken into the service of the East India Company, and now protect the territory they used to desolate. (J. Grant, Colebrooke, Lord Valentia, &c.)

A majority of the inhabitants are Mohammedans, and a college of that religion still exists, but in a state of great decay. There are two very singular round towers, about a mile N.W. from the town. The Rajah of Jeynagur consider them so holy, that he has erected a building to shelter his subjects who visit them.

The town, which is entirely built of bamboos, mats, and thatch, has been more than once removed, on account of the encroachments of the Ganges, and exhibits more the appearance of a temporary fair or encampment than that of a town.

In this neighbourhood are many European productions, such as the peach, apricot, walnut, strawberry, raspberry, dandelion, butterflower, and white rose. Here are also forests of spreading firs of very large dimensions, and yielding much pitch. (Raper, &c.)\nmestic concerns, nor in the streets where they live. The view from the fort is extremely beautiful towards the bay, which is here and there broken by islands, many of which are covered with trees, while the lofty and curious shaped hills of the table land form a striking back ground. The sea is on three sides of the fort, and on the fourth is the esplanade; at the extremity of which is the black town, amidst cocoa-nut trees.\n\nBombay is the only principal settlement in India where the rise of the tides is sufficient to permit the construction of docks on a large scale; the very highest spring tides reach to 17 feet, but the usual height is 14 feet. The docks are the Company's property, and the king's ships pay a high monthly rent for repairs. They are entirely occupied by Parsees, who possess an absolute monopoly in all the departments; the person who contracts for the timber being a Parsee, and the inspector of it on delivery of the same cast. On the 23d of June, 1810, the Minden 74, built entirely by Parsees, without the least European assistance, was launched from these dock-yards. The teak forests, from whence these yards are supplied, lie along the western side of the Ghaut mountains, and other contiguous ridges of hills on the north and east of Basseen; the numerous rivers that descend from them affording water carriage for the timber.\n\nThe common and sweet potatoe are very good at Bombay; but the vegetable for which Bombay is celebrated all over the east, is the onion. Potatoes are now produced in this quarter of India in the greatest abundance, although so recently introduced; the Bombay market is supplied with this root from Gujrat, and also with some cheese, which is hard and ill flavoured. The buffalo furnishes the milk and butter, and occasionally the beef; but Europeans in general are prejudiced against it.\n\nThe Bazar mutton is hard and lean; but, when well fed, is as good as the English. Kid is always good, and the poultry abundant; but not good, unless fed on purpose. The fish are excellent, but the larger kinds not plentiful. The bumbelo resembles a large sand eel, and, after being dried in the sun, is usually eaten at breakfast, with a dish of rice and split pease, coloured with turmeric, named kedgeere. The prawns are uncommonly fine. The island is too small to furnish much game; but the red-legged partridge is not uncommon, and snipes are sometimes seen. The frogs here are large, and are eaten by the Chinese and Portuguese.\n\nThis little island commands the entire trade of the north-west coast of India, together with that of the Persian Gulf. The principal cargo of a ship, bound from Bombay or Surat to China, is cotton; in the stowing and screwing of which, the commanders and officers are remarkably dexterous. Some of the large ships will carry upwards of 4000 bales, containing about 2,500 Bombay candies, of 560 pounds avordupois, or total, 1,400,000 pounds. The other part of their cargo consists of sandal wood and pepper, from the Malabar coast; gums, drugs, and pearls from Arabia, Abyssinia, and Persia; elephants' teeth, cornelians, and other produce of Cambay, sharks' fins, bird nests, &c. from the Maldive and Lackadive Islands. These ships generally arrive at Canton in the month of June, or beginning of July, and lie there idle (except delivering their cargo and receiving the return cargo) until the month of December or January. In 1808, the quantity of cotton brought to Bombay for re-exportation was 85,000 bales, of 375 pounds, the half of which is procured from the country on the Nerbuddah, and the rest from Gujrat and Cutch; the quantity, however, is not usually so large. The cotton screw is worked by a capstan, to each bar of which there are 30 men, amounting, in the whole, to about 240 to each screw.\nHemp is packed in the same manner; but it requires to be carefully laid in the press, for the fibres are liable to be broken if they are bent.\n\nFor the European market, Bombay is an excellent place to procure gums and drugs of all sorts, Mocha coffee, barilla, cornelians, agates, and also blue and other Surat goods. In 1810, the prime cost of the goods, exported from England to Bombay by the East India Company, amounted only to 116,787l.\n\nCommerce of Bombay, from the 1st May, 1811, to the 30th April, 1812.\n\nThe total value of goods imported from London, from the 1st May, 1811, to the 30th April, 1812, amounted to 2,045,363 rupees, viz.\n- Grain and other articles of food 4,772\n- Articles for the use of the natives 75,363\n- Sundries for Europeans 1,313,661\n- Ditto for manufactures 368,293\n- Ditto for re-exportation 202,942\n- Piece goods 80,832\n\nTotal 2,045,363\n\nTreasure 13,579\n\nRupees 2,058,942\n\nThe value of the exports to London, during the above period, was 941,282 rupees, viz.\n- Surat manufactures 3,183\n- The produce of Madeira 39,880\n- Ditto Mosambique 15,834\n- Ditto Bengal 62,957\n- Ditto Penang & eastwards 54,142\n- Ditto Malabar & Canara 81,169\n- Ditto Persian Gulf 14,678\n- Ditto Arabian Gulf 401,603\n- Ditto Cashmere 12,683\n- Ditto Gujrat 49,450\n- Piece goods 110,650\n\nTotal 941,282\n\nTreasure 589,018\n\nHorses 7,500\n\nRupees 1,537,800\n\nThe imports to Bombay from Madeira, during 1811-12, amounted to 70,360 rupees.

The maintenance of this force is rendered necessary by the swarms of pirates who infest the western coast of India, from the shores of the Persian Gulf to Goa, and who are distinguished, particularly those who lurk in the more northerly tracts, by their courage, cunning, and ferocity. These nautical banditti have haunted the very same regions since the time of Alexander the Great, and probably longer. Out of 104 marine covenanted servants, Bombay employs 93.\nA court of judicature is held at Bombay, by a single judge with the title of recorder, the authority and practice of this tribunal being altogether conformable to those of the supreme court at Calcutta. The law practitioners of this court are three barristers, and eight attorneys.\n\nIn 1811 the number of civil servants on the Bombay establishment was 74, and the pay, allowances, and emoluments of the whole civil service, including the European uncovenanted assistants, amounted to \u00a3174,238l. In the same year the pay and allowances of the military officers on the Bombay establishment, 549 in number, was \u00a3171,450l, and the amount of the Company's Bombay regular army of all descriptions 20,988 men. Surgeons 40, pay and allowances \u00a322,876l. Chaplains five, pay and allowances \u00a34795l. In the Bombay army a very great proportion of the sepoys come from the Maharratta country in whole families together, and, mixing but little with the other sects, still retain their native language.\n\nBombay is supposed to contain above 220,000 inhabitants. Of this number about 8000 are Parsees, and nearly as many Mahommedans, and three or 4000 Jews; the remainder are Portuguese and Hindoos; the latter composing more than three-fourths of the whole population. The houses of the rich are of great extent, because the children of the family continue to live in the same house even after they are married. The lower classes have small huts, mostly of clay, covered with a mat made of the leaves of the palmira. Their wages are a great deal higher than in Bengal, but food is dearer; palanquin bearers receive seven and eight rupees per month.\n\nAmong the Europeans the rage for country houses prevails as generally as at Madras, and is attended with the same inconveniences, all business being necessarily transacted in the fort. The generality of the country houses are comfortable and elegant, and although not so splendid as those of Calcutta and Madras, are better adapted to the climate, and enjoy most beautiful views. The only English church is in the fort. The Portuguese and Armenian churches are numerous, both within and without the walls; and there are three or four synagogues, with many temples and mosques. The largest pagoda is in the Black Town, 1\u00bd miles from the fort, and is dedicated to Mumba Devi.\n\nThe Parsee inhabitants of Bombay possess nearly the whole of the island, and seem to have perfectly domesticated themselves in their new abode, since their expulsion from Persia by the Mahommedans. They are an active and loyal body of men, and contribute greatly to the prosperity of the settlement. In every European house of trade there is a Parsee partner, who usually produces the largest portion of the capital. They wear an Asiatic dress, but they eat and drink like the English. In the morning and evening they crowd to the esplanade to pay their adoration, by prostration to the sun; on these occasions the females do not appear, but they still go to the well for water.\n\nMost of the original Parsee customs continue unaltered, particularly the mode of sepulture, which is as follows:\n\nThe body of the defunct is deposited in a circular building, open at the top, about 55 feet in diameter, and 25 in height, filled up to within five feet of the top, excepting a well, 15 feet in diameter in the centre, the part so filled being terraced with a slight declivity towards the well. Two circular grooves, three inches deep, are raised round the well, the first at the distance of four, and the second at the distance of 10 feet from the well. Grooves of the like depth and height, and four feet distant from each other at the outer part of the outer circle, are carried straight from the wall to the well, communicating with the circular ones to\ncarry off the water. The tomb is, by this means, divided into three circles of partitions; the outer for men, the middle for women, and the inner for children. There they are respectively placed, wrapped loosely in a piece of cloth, and left to be devoured by the vultures; which is soon done, as numbers of these birds are always seen hovering and watching about these charnel houses for their prey. The friends of the deceased, or the persons who have charge of the tomb, come at the proper time, and throw the bones into their receptacle, the well in the centre. From the bottom of the well subterranean passages lead to remove the bones, to prevent the well from filling. Men of great property sometimes build one of the above sort for themselves. The public tombs are five in number, but not all in use, and are situated about three miles north-westerly from Bombay Fort. The sun and the sea partake with fire in the adoration of the Parsees; their year is divided into 12 lunar months, but they have no division of time into weeks.\n\nThere is a great difference between the character and habits in society of the natives of our principal settlements and those of the interior. A person who has resided only at Bombay, cannot have an intimate knowledge respecting the habits and manners of the natives in the interior provinces of India. Not many years ago, a widow at Bombay wanted to burn herself with her husband's corpse, which being prevented, she applied to the governor, who refused permission; upon which she crossed the harbour to the Maharatta shore, and there underwent the ceremony. That few crimes of magnitude occur at Bombay, is proved by a statement made in open court by the recorder in May, 1810, that, for six years prior to that period, he never had had occasion to condemn any criminal to the punishment of death.\n\nThe society here is less numerous, and the salaries of the public servants smaller than at the two chief presidencies; economy is consequently more attended to, but the style of living is frequently elegant, and always comfortable and abundant. Rice, the chief food of the lower orders, is frequently imported from Bengal, even in favourable years.\n\nA society has been established at Bombay on a plan somewhat similar to the Bengal Asiatic Society; but it intends to limit itself to the present state of manners among the inhabitants of the country. The situation of Bombay ought to be healthy, but it is said to be the reverse, and that the liver is a complaint more frequent and fatal here than in any other part of India. Exposure to the land breeze, which sets in every evening, is frequently followed by a fever; moderate living, cautiously avoiding opposite extremes, is found most conducive to health.\n\nThe travelling distance from Bombay to Calcutta is 1300 miles; to Delhi, 965; to Hyderabad, 480; to Madras, 770; to Poonah, 98; to Seringapatam, 620; and to Surat, 177 miles.\n\nAs a place of consequence Bombay owes its origin to the Portuguese, to whom it was ceded in 1530, having been before a dependence on a chief residing at Tannah, in Salsette. On account of its fine harbour a fort was erected by them, but the vicinity of Goa, the Portuguese capital, prevented its becoming in their hand a place of any consequence. Two derivations are assigned to the name, one from the Portuguese Buon bahia (a good bay), and the other from the Hindoo Goddess, Bomba Devi.\n\nThis island was ceded to King Charles the Second in June 1661, as part of Queen Catherine's portion; and in March, 1662, a fleet of five men of war, under the command of the Earl of Marlborough, was dispatched, with 500 troops under Sir\nAbraham Shipman, and arrived at Bombay on the 18th of September, 1662; but the Portuguese Governor evaded the cession. The English admiral demanded Bombay and its dependencies, comprehending Salsette and Tannah, and the Portuguese interpreted the treaty to signify Bombay only. The troops were removed to the Island of Anjidiva, where the mortality was so great, that the surviving commanding officer, Mr. Cooke, was glad to accept the Island of Bombay on any terms, and to this place they were transferred in February, 1664-65, the survivors mustering only 119 rank and file. Such was the unfortunate commencement of this afterwards flourishing settlement, which in the hands of the Portuguese had remained almost a desert. Mr. Cooke may be considered as the first English Governor of Bombay; on the 5th of November, 1666, he was succeeded by Sir Gervase Lucas.\n\nIt was soon discovered that the king had made an unprofitable acquisition, and that the East India Company were much injured by the trade carried on by persons in the king's service, who sold European goods, for which they paid no freight. In consequence of these and other reasons, the king, on the 27th of March, 1663, by letters patent, transferred the Island of Bombay from the crown to the East India Company, in free and common socage, as the manor of East Greenwich, on payment of the annual rent of 10l. in gold, on the 30th of September of each year. The revenue of the island, shortly after the cession, was estimated at 2823l. per annum.\n\nSir Gervase Lucas died the 21st of March, 1667, and was succeeded by the deputy-governor, Captain Henry Geary. At the commencement of this government, Mr. Cooke, the first governor, endeavoured to assemble a force at Salsette, assisted by the Jesuits of Goa, to re-establish himself in the Island of Bombay, but ineffectually. In 1667-68, the revenues had increased to 6490l. the garrison was 285 men, of which number 93 were Englishmen, and the rest French, Portuguese, and natives.\n\nOn the 23d of September, 1668, Bombay was taken possession of for the East India Company by Sir George Oxinden, the chief Company's governor, and the troops were transferred from the king's to the Company's service, along with the arms, ordnance, and stores. Sir G. Oxinden died on the 14th of July, 1669, and was succeeded by Mr. Gerald Augier, as Chief of Surat and Governor of Bombay, which continued extremely unhealthy, and much infested by the depredations of the Maharatta pirates.\n\nIn 1672-3, a strong Dutch fleet appeared off Bombay, and created great alarm; but, after reconnoitring it, disappeared without making any attack. In the succeeding year there were 100 pieces of cannon mounted in the fortifications, and the garrison consisted of 400 regulars, of which the greater proportion were topasses, and 300 militia. In 1676, letters patent were obtained from the king to establish a mint at Bombay, at which they were empowered to coin rupees, piec, and budgerooks.\n\nMr. Augier died in 1677, and was succeeded at Bombay by Mr. Henry Oxinden. At this time Bombay continued of very little political or commercial importance, which in part proceeded from the vigorous government of Aurangzebe on the Delhi throne, and the rising power of the Maharattas, under the martial Sevajee. In 1679, the Island of Kenery was occupied by the troops of Sevajee, and the beginning of the next year the Island of Kenery was seized on by the siddee, or Mogul Admiral, the Bombay government not daring to oppose either, and from their proximity being kept in a state of continual alarm.\n\nIn 1681, Mr. John Child, the brother of Sir Josiah Child, was appointed President at Surat, one of\nthe junior counsellors being appointed to act as deputy-governor of Bombay. In 1683-4, the Court of Directors, in consequence of the capture of Bantam by the Dutch, constituted Bombay an independent English settlement, and the seat of the power and trade of the English nation in the East Indies.\n\nOn the 23d of December, 1683, Captain Richard Kegwin, who commanded the Company's garrison, assisted by Ensign Thompson and others, seized on Mr. Ward, the deputy-governor, and such members of the council as adhered to him, and assumed the government. The garrison, consisting of 150 English soldiers, and 200 topasses, were joined by the inhabitants of the island, who elected Captain Kegwin governor, and declared they would only acknowledge the king's authority, although, in the interval betwixt the acquisition of the island and this period, the East India Company had expended 300,000l. at Bombay on fortifications and improvements.\n\nIn 1684-5, Captain Kegwin negotiated a treaty with Rajah Sambajee, from whom he recovered 12,000 pagodas due to the Company; and on the 19th of November, 1684, he surrendered the island to Sir Thomas Grantham, on condition of a general pardon to himself and his adherents. He had not, it appears, embezzled any of the Company's money in the fort, which was restored to them entire, but had subsisted on the revenues of the island.\n\nIn 1686, the seat of the English government was ordered to be transferred from Surat to Bombay, and next year, Sir John Child dying, the office of President devolved on Mr. Harris, then a prisoner at Surat, but released by the Mogul governor next year.\n\nIn 1688-9, the siddhee's fleet (Mogul's admiral) invaded Bombay, and got possession of Mahein, Mazagong, and Sion, and kept the governor and garrison besieged in the town and castle. An order was soon after obtained from Aurengzebe, directing the sidhee to withdraw his troops; but the evacuation did not take place until the 22d of June, 1690, when the lands belonging to the Portuguese Jesuits were seized, they having been active in promoting the views of the sidhee during the invasion.\n\nIn 1691-2, the population of Bombay was much reduced by the plague, of the civil servants only three remaining alive; and in 1694, Sir Joshua Gayer arrived, as Governor at Bombay, which he found in a disastrous state, principally caused by the depredations of the English pirates on the Mogul ships. Aurengzebe insisting that all the loss sustained by his subjects should be made good by the East India Company. These pirates in 1698 possessed two frigates, of 30 guns, off Cape Comorin, under Captain Kidd, who was afterwards taken and hanged; one of 50, one of 40, and one of 30 guns, off the Malabar Coast.\n\nIn 1798-9, Sir Nicholas Waite was appointed resident at Surat, on the part of the New or English Company; and in 1700, by his intrigues, procured the imprisonment of Sir John Gayer and Mr. Colt, the Old or London Company's servants. At this time Bombay was in a very weakly state, and under constant alarm of invasion from the Mahrattas, Arabs, or Portuguese. In 1702-3, it was again visited by the plague, which carried off many hundreds of the natives, and reduced the garrison to 76 men.\n\nIn 1708, the two rival Companies having united, Sir Nicholas Waite was dismissed, but Sir John Gayer, the legitimate governor, still continuing in confinement at Surat, Mr. Aislable was appointed; and such was the continued feebleness of the settlement, that the Bombay government this year declined receiving an envoy from the King of Persia, for fear he should observe the weak-\nness of the place, both by sea and land.\n\nWith the junction of the rival Companies, in 1708, Mr. Bruce's authentic History of the East India Company concludes, and we have no documents that can be depended on to fill up the interval since that period. The history of the infancy of a colony is, however, always the most interesting; and it will be seen, from the foregoing narrative, with what perseverance the East India Company supported a settlement, from which, for many years, they derived no profit, and experienced much trouble.\n\nAt present Bombay may be said to rule the whole western coast of India, and its influence is felt along the coasts of Persia and Arabia; but the territorial possessions under its immediate jurisdiction are small, compared with those of Bengal and Madras. They consist principally of the districts of Surat, Broach, Cambay, Goelwarah, and other countries extending along both sides of the Gulf of Cambay, a considerable proportion of which were obtained since 1802 from Amund Row Guicowar, a Maharatta prince, and the whole are contained within the province of Gujrat, of which they compose by far the most fertile, highly cultivated, and populous portion. The inhabitants of this region are among the most intelligent and industrious of Hindostan, and from hence large quantities of cotton manufactures are exported to all parts of the world. From these districts also a great export of the raw material takes place, partly the produce of the lands within the Company's influence, and partly brought from the interior on the large navigable rivers, such as the Nerbuddah, Tuptee, Mahy, and Mehindry, which, with many others of smaller note, empty their streams into the Gulf of Cambay.\n\nThe principal sea port towns, besides Bombay, are Surat, Broach, Cambay, and Gogo, from which are procured the best native seamen in India, the natives along the gulf, particularly on the west side, being much addicted to navigation. The contiguous Island of Salsetto is also subordinate to this government, but most unaccountably continues to exhibit the same state of desolation in which it was originally received.\n\nIt is difficult, with any precision, to define the extent of the Bombay territorial possessions, as some of the peshwa's districts are intermingled with them, and approach within a few miles of the city of Surat. On a rough estimate, however, they may be calculated to comprehend 10,000 square miles, containing a population exceeding altogether two and a half millions, in the probable proportion of one Mahommedan to 15 Hindoos. Nearly nine-tenths of all the existing Parsees are resident within the Bombay limits, but no estimate of their numbers, approaching to exactness, has even been made. (Lord Valentia, Bruce, M. Graham, Moore, Elmore, R. Grant, Malcolm, Macpherson, Rennel, 12 Reg., &c.)\n\nBonaa.\u2014A small island in the Eastern Seas, 25 miles in circumference, lying off the N.W. extremity of Ceram. Lat.3\u00b0 S. Long. 128\u00b0 5\u2032 E.\n\nBonawasi.\u2014A small town in the province of North Canara, district of Soonda, on the confines of the Bednore district. Lat. 14\u00b0 27\u2032 N. Long. 75\u00b0 12\u2032 E. In Hyder's time it contained 500 houses, but is now much reduced. Its walls are ruinous; and, although it has been a place of great celebrity, do not appear to have been of considerable extent. A great part of the adjoining country is waste, and overgrown with forests, but not containing much teak. This place is noted by Ptolemy, and is said to have had a dynasty of kings, who ruled 1450 years before the Christian era. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nBonaratte.\u2014A small island in the Eastern Seas, due south of Sale-\nyer, principally inhabited by Buggesses. On this island, and Calawe, a small island in the neighbourhood, the Buggess sovereign is said to have an establishment for the education of his dancing girls.\n\n**Bonghir**, *(Vanaghiri, a woody mountain).*\u2014A district in the Nizam's dominions in the province of Hyderabad, situated between the 17th and 18th degrees of north latitude. It is better peopled and cultivated than a great proportion of the Nizam's country, but has no river of consequence. The chief towns are Bonghir and Hydershy.\n\n**Bonghir.**\u2014A town in the province of Hyderabad, district of Bonghir, 24 miles E. from Hyderabad. Lat. 17\u00b0. 18'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 6'. E.\n\n**Bonhara.**\u2014A town in the province of Gujrat, district of Broach, 35 miles E. of Surat. Lat. 21\u00b0. 7'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 33'. E.\n\n**Bonnee River**, *(Vani).*\u2014The Soanak, which rises in the district of Chuta Nagpoor, joins the Burkee River, about Lat. 21\u00b0. 43'. N. Long. 84\u00b0. 50'. E. from whence the united streams pursue a course of about 110 miles, under the appellation of the Braminy Noy River, which it then changes for that of the Bonnee River. Its course is afterwards nearly due east, until it is joined by the Coyle, or Byturnee River, when they flow together into the Bay of Bengal, 10 miles north from Point Palmiras. The whole course, from the rise of the Soanak, may be estimated at 360 miles, including the windings; and the countries it passes through are Chuta Nagpoor, Gangpoor, Sumbhalpoor, and Cuttaek.\n\n**Bonsolo.**\u2014A district in the territories of the Poonah Maharattas, on the sea coast of the province of Bejaipoor, between the 16th and 17th degrees of north latitude. It is intersected by many mountain streams, which flow from the Western Ghauts, such as the Gheriah, Denghur, and Atkerah Rivers, so named from fortresses at their junctions with the sea, and formerly the resort of the piratical fleets which infested this coast. The principal towns are Gheriah, Raree, and Vingorla. A great proportion of this district belongs to an independent Maharatta Chief, named the Rajah of Colapoor.\n\n**Bontain.**\u2014A small district in the Island of Celebes, situated at the southern extremity. It was anciently considered among the dependent allies of Macassar, but was afterwards ceded to the Dutch East India Company. Captain Carteret, who put into the Bay of Bontain, in Lat. 5\u00b0. 33'. S. Long. 119\u00b0. 47'. E., gives a very good character of the inhabitants. He describes Bontain Bay as large and capacious, and says, that ships may lie in safety there during both monsoons. In this bay there are several small towns; that which is called Bontain lies to the north, and has a small pallisadoed fort. Wood and water are to be procured here in great plenty, and also fresh provisions. Fowls and fruits abound, and rice may be had in any quantity. There are great numbers of wild hogs in the woods, which may be had cheap, as the natives, being Mahommedans, never eat them. The tides are very irregular; commonly it is but once high water, and once low water in 24 hours, and the difference is seldom more than six feet. *(Stavorinus, Wilcoche, &c.)*\n\n**Bony.**\u2014A kingdom in the Island of Celebes, extending 20 leagues along the western shore of the Gulf of Bony, from the River Chinrana to the River Salinico. This gulf, or arm of the sea, is named by the natives, Sewa, and by the Europeans, Buggess Bay, and deeply indents the Island of Celebes to the south. With the kingdom of Bony a considerable trade is carried on, it producing gold, rice, sago, cassia, tortoise shells, pearls, &c. &c.\n\nTo the north of Bony, along the bottom of the bay, the country is well inhabited, and abounds in sago, which is very cheap; also cassia and\npearls. Near the bottom of the gulf, at the River Loo, boat building is carried on; also a trade in gold, sago, cassia, and seed pearls. The inhabitants along the sea-coast fish for swallo, (named also sea slug, tripuna, and biche de mar) which they carry to Macassar, and sell to the Chinese junks. On the east side of the bay the country is not so well inhabited as on the west, and navigation of the bay is extremely hazardous to ships of burthen, on account of the numberless shoals and small rocky clusters in it.\n\nThis is the proper country of the Buggesses, (bugis, or bouginese) who are remarkably industrious and skilful in all kinds of curious filagree work in gold and silver, and in weaving the striped and checked cotton cloths worn in all the Malay islands. They excel also in making matchlocks, firelocks, and all kinds of arms and accoutrements, and in building large prows and other vessels. This ancient, brave, and martial nation became known to Europeans only in their decline. In courage, enterprise, fidelity, and even fair dealing in commerce, they are placed at the head of the Orang Timor, or eastern men. The nation to which the bugis exhibit the greatest resemblance are the Japanese.\n\nThe Bugis may be reckoned the original language of the island of Celebes. On the sea-coast it is much mixed with the Eastern Malay, and is found pure only in the ancient books, and in the interior of Celebes. The alphabet consists of 22 letters; the form of the character is peculiar, but resembles the Batta and Tagala. The Koran has been translated into the Bugis language, and they also possess traditional and historical songs and romances in that dialect.\n\nThe Buggesses possess a code of written laws; but they also determine many disputes by single combat, never avenging themselves by personal assassination. In this they differ essentially from the Sooloo nation, who never think of putting themselves on an equality with their antagonist, but always attack him in the dark, or when off his guard.\n\nAccording to Stavorinus, the first monarch of the Buggesses, affirmed by them to be of celestial origin, instituted the laws of the country, which are still observed. He appointed seven electors, the dignity to be hereditary in particular families, and descending to females as well as the other sex. All matters of importance must be decided by this electoral college, their power extending to the deposition as well as the appointing of their kings, and also the making of peace or war.\n\nIn the beginning of the 17th century, the Buggesses were compelled by the Macassars to adopt the Mahommedan, but we have no account of their prior religion. The kingdom of Bony was once so powerful, that the state could bring 70,000 fighting men into the field, and greatly assisted the Dutch in the conquest of Macassar, of which they have since had reason to repent.\n\nRajah Polacca, a powerful prince and sovereign of Bony, died in 1696, and was succeeded by his son, Lapatoua, who died in 1713.\n\nThe daughter of the latter, Battara Todja, succeeded him as the 16th sovereign of Bony, and resigned in 1715, when she was succeeded by her half-brother, Lapadang Sajati, who was deposed in 1720, and the Queen Battara Todja restored. Her reign was a perpetual scene of civil and foreign war; during which she was repeatedly dethroned and re-elected, and the capital taken and plundered by the contending parties several times. In 1749, she died, and was succeeded by her half-brother, Lama Ossong, under the name of Abdul Zabshab Jalaluddeen, who reigned in 1775, and was then above 80 years of age. Prior to this period the state of Bony had been brought under subjection by the Dutch, to whom the king was obliged to take an oath of fidelity and allegiance.\nThe policy of the Dutch was to keep the Macassars and Buggesses in a state of perpetual hostility, by which they at last subdued the former principality, and the latter soon followed. On the decline of the Dutch power, the state of Bony again attained independence, which must have been confirmed by the conquest of the Dutch settlements in Celebes, in 1812, by the British. (Stavorinus, Forrest, Leyden, Quarterly Review, Dalrymple, &c.)\n\nBoobooan.\u2014A small island in the Eastern Seas, lying off the south end of the Island of Basseelean, and having a small hummock on the north part of the island, which is very woody, but inhabited.\n\nBoodicotta, (Buddhacata).\u2014A town in the Baranatal district, 30 miles E. by S. from Bangaloor. Lat. 12\u00b0.51'. N. Long. 78\u00b0.18'. E.\n\nBoogebooge, (Bhujabhay).\u2014A town in the province of Cutch, possessed by independent native chiefs, situated about 10 miles inland from the Gulf of Cutch. Lat. 23\u00b0.15'. N. Long. 69\u00b0.45'. E. The fort of this district is named Muddi, and stands at the mouth of a small river, about 20 miles distant from Boogebooge, and is one of the chief places of export in the province of Cutch. In 1809, the name of the chief of Booge was Futteh Mahommed, who had extended his influence across the Gulf of Cutch, and placed a garrison in Positra, in Okamundel, from whence he claimed a share of all piratical captures. By the natives this place is frequently named Cutch Bhoojung, and reckoned the capital of the province.\n\nBool.\u2014One of the southernmost of the Philippine Isles, situated about the 10th degree of north latitude. In length it may be estimated at 35 miles, by 30 miles the average breadth.\n\nBool, or Bullum.\u2014A small district above the Western Ghauts, but now comprehended in the British province of Canara. It is situated about the 13th degree of north latitude, and is so mountainous and covered with forests, that although nominally subject to the former Mysore sovereigns, it never was effectually conquered until military roads were opened through the forest towns by Gen. Wellesley in 1801-2. It contains no town of consequence, and being situated on the top of a ridge of hills, its rivers are mere mountain streams.\n\nBoolacoomba.\u2014A district subject to the Dutch, situated at the southern extremity of the Island of Celebes. The land is fertile in rice, abounds with game, and has extensive forests; but the timber is not well adapted for the construction of houses. During the west monsoon the road before Boolacoomba is dangerous for ships; small vessels, however, can run into the River Kali-konguang. Near the mouth of this river stands the Dutch pallisadoed fort Carolina, in which a resident was stationed, who also had the superintendence of the kingdom of Bera. The men of the latter province are, in general, good warriors both by sea and land. The richest are merchants; others employ themselves in building prows, and in manufacturing a coarse cloth from the cotton, which is plenty. A small tribute of these cloths was annually paid to the Dutch East India Company. (Stavorinus, &c.)\n\nBoondee, (Buddi).\u2014A town in the province of Ajmeer, district of Harowty, tributary to the Maharattas. Lat. 25\u00b0.26'. N. Long. 75\u00b0.35'. E.\n\nThis town is situated on the southerly declivity of a long range of hills, which runs nearly from east to west. The palace of the rajah, a large massy building of stone, is about half way up the hill, and a kind of fortification extends to the top. The Bondee Rajah is of the Hara tribe, and was formerly of considerable power and possessions, but both have been greatly reduced by the Maharattas. His territories, though of small extent and revenue, are of\nimportance, as they command a principal pass into Upper Hindostan.\n\nDuring the retreat of Col. Monson, in 1804, the Boondce Rajah greatly assisted him in his distress; and his conduct had been uniformly friendly to the English; yet, at the peace of 1805, he was abandoned by the British government to the vengeance of the Maharattas. (Malcolm, Hunter, &c.)\n\nBoontal, (Bhuvantala).\u2014A small district in the northern part of the Lahdaek country, situated betwixt the 35th and 36th degrees of north latitude; respecting which nothing is known, except its geographical position.\n\nBooree Rapty River, (Revati).\u2014This river has its source in the hills which separate the province of Oude from the Nepaul territories in Northern Hindostan, from whence it flows through the Goraepoor district, and joins the Gograh, a few miles below Dooryghaut.\n\nBooriphana.\u2014A small town in the province of Delhi, within the former district of Sumroo Begum, 42 miles N. N. W. from Delhi. Lat. 29\u00b0. 18'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 20'. E.\n\nBoorghaut.\u2014A ghaunt, or pass, through the western range of mountains, which is ascended on the road from Bombay to Poonah. This passage, although very rugged and steep, is not so much so as the Ambah pass; yet the hills are of great height, and present many fine scenes to the artist to delineate. Near the summit is a small village, named Coondallah, and another at the bottom named Expoly, with a handsome tank of great extent, enclosed with a stone wall, and having a flight of stone steps to the water. (Moor, &c.)\n\nBoorhanpoor.\u2014A city in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Khandesh, of which it was formerly the capital, situated on the N. W. side of the River Tuptee. Lat. 21\u00b0. 20'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 20'. E.\n\nThis town is the head-quarters of a singular sect of Mahommmedans, named Bohrah, whose moullah, or high priest resides here. They distinguish their own sect by the name of Ismaeliah, deriving their origin from one of the followers of the prophet, who flourished in the age immediately succeeding that of Mahommmed. They form a very large society, spread over all the countries of the Deccan, and carry on an extensive commerce in all the provinces where their members are dispersed, appropriating a certain portion of their gains to the maintenance of their high priest. In Surat, there are 6000 families of Bohrahs, and in Oujain 1500. A younger brother of the moullah resides at Oujain, and exercises a temporary and spiritual authority over the Bohrahs resident there.\n\nThis city was taken possession of by the British army under Colonel Stevenson, on the 16th Oct. 1803, without resistance; but was restored at the conclusion of the peace, in Dec. 1803. It is much fallen off from its former grandeur; and the decay is likely, from the nature of the government to which it is at present subject, to continue.\n\nTravelling distance from Oojain, 154; Nagpoor, 256; Poonah, 288; Bombay, 340; Agra, 508; and Calcutta, by Nagpoor, 978 miles. (Hunter, Rennel, &c.)\n\nBoorkoo.\u2014A small village in the Gujrat Peninsula, situated near the Run, six miles S. W. from Amran, and surrounded by a wall of black rock, which abounds in the adjacent country. This village belongs to Sunderjee Sewjee, the agent for horses to the Bombay government.\n\nBooro.\u2014An island in the eastern seas, situated betwixt the 3d and 4th degrees of south latitude, and the 126th and 127th of east longitude. In length it may be estimated at 75 miles, by 38 miles the average breadth.\n\nThe principal settlement on this island is Cajelli, situated at the bottom of a gulf of the same name, in a marshy plain. The Dutch built a\nstone fort here, which was blown up in 1689; since which they have only had an inclosure of palisadoes, the island proving but an unprofitable settlement to them, as it produced no spicceries. Buffaloes and rice are to be had here in abundance, and also cocoa-nuts, bananas, lemons, citrons, bitter oranges, a few pine apples; and it is on this island that the best cajeputa oil is procured. Booro produces different sorts of ebony, and also the sago, palm, and teak trees. Ships may be supplied here with rice, cattle, and other refreshments, and the woods abound with the babi roussa or hog deer.\n\nThe Chinese trade here for cabinet woods, and for different species of dye woods. Part of the inhabitants are Mahommedans, and have a mosque here; but the interior of the island is inhabited by the aborigines or horaforas, who live dispersed among the inaccessible mountains, and subsist on sago, fruits, and the produce of the chase. The south of Booro is much infested by the Papuas from New Guinea. (Forest, La Billardiere, Bougainville, Slavovius, &c.)\n\nBoosnah.\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Jessore, 50 miles, W. by S. from Dacca. Lat. 23\u00b0. 31'. N. Long. 89\u00b0. 39'. E.\n\nBOOTAN, (Bhutan).\n\nA country in Northern Hindostan, situated principally between the 27th and 28th degrees of north latitude. By the inhabitants of Hindostan it is also named the country of the Deb Rajah; and by the inhabitants of Tibet, Dukba. The boundaries are very inaccurately defined; but, as an approximation, the province may be estimated at 200 miles in length, by 90 miles the average breadth. To the north it is separated from Tibet by the Himalaya, or Soomoonang Mountains, to the south is the province of Bengal; to the east it has an unexplored region north of Assam; and to the west the Kyrant country, subject to the Nepalese.\n\nThis province presents nothing to the view, but the most mis-shapen irregularities; mountains covered with eternal verdure, and rich with abundant forests of large and lofty trees. Almost every mountain has a rapid torrent at its base, and many of the loftiest have populous villages amidst orchards and other plantations. In its external appearance it is the reverse of Tibet, which is a level table land.\n\nThe mountains of Bootan form part of the great chain, which geographers term Mons Imans; and of which frequent mention is made in the mythological histories of the Brahmans, by the name of Himalaya. At the foot of the chain of hills, towards the Bengal frontier, is a plain of about 25 miles in breadth, choked up with the most luxuriant vegetation; and from its inaptitude to supply the wants, or facilitate the functions of human life, may be considered as appertaining properly to neither. The exhalations arising from the multitude of springs, which the vicinity of the mountains produces, are collected and confined by the woods, and generate a most pestilential atmosphere. The trees are large, and the forests abound with elephants; the human inhabitants are much debased in form, size, and strength.\n\nThe climate of Bootan, affords every degree of variation; for, at the time the inhabitants of Punakha are cautious of exposing themselves to an almost vertical sun, those of Ghassa feel all the rigour of winter, and are chilled by perpetual snows; yet both places are within sight of each other.\n\nIn this province almost every favourable aspect of the mountains, coated with the smallest quantity of soil, is cleared and adapted for cultivation, by being shelved into horizontal beds. The country abounds with excellent limestone; but the natives appear unacquainted with\nits uses, either for building or for agricultural purposes. The season of the rains about Tassisudon, the capital, is remarkably moderate; there are frequent showers, but none of those heavy torrents which accompany the monsoon in Bengal.\n\nIn Bootan are to be found strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries, growing wild; there are also the apple, pear, peach, and apricot trees; also the ash, birch, maple, yew, pine, and fir, but no oak trees. The forests abound with a variety of handsome timber, and the fir is often found eight and 10 feet in circumference. The turnips are remarkably good, being large, free from fibres, and very sweet. The best fruits are oranges, peaches, apricots, pomegranates, and walnuts. For irrigation the Booteas conduct water across the chasms of the mountains, through the hollow trunks of trees. In this country great part of the field labour falls on the females. They plant, weed, and to them eventually the task falls of applying the sickle, and brandishing the flail. In all laborious offices they are exposed to hardships and inclement weather.\n\nWild animals are not numerous in Bootan, but monkies of a large and handsome kind abound, and are held sacred by the Booteas, as well as by the Hindoos. The species of horse, which is indigenous to Bootan, is called Tannian or Tau-gun, from Tangustan, the general appellation of that assemblage of mountains, which constitutes the territory of Bootan; the breed being altogether confined within these limits. They are usually 13 hands high, and remarkable for their symmetry and just proportions. They are distinguished in general by a tendency to piebald, those of one colour being rare. They are short bodied, clean limbed, and though deep in the chest, extremely active. Accustomed among their native mountains to struggle against opposition, they seem to inherit this spirit as a principle of their nature; and hence, have acquired among Europeans, a character of being headstrong and ungovernable, though in reality it proceeds from an excess of eagerness to perform their task.\n\nFrom Bootan a caravan annually visits the district of Rungpoor in Bengal, bringing with it oranges, walnuts, and the coarse woollen manufactures of that country, with the horses that carry them, for sale. The same privilege has never been allowed by the Bootan government to the inhabitants of Bengal. The presents sent by the Deb Rajah to the Bengal presidency, in 1772, consisted of sheets of gilt leather, stamped with the black eagle of the Russian armorial, talents of gold and silver, and bulks of gold dust; bags of genuine musk, narrow woollen cloths, the manufacture of Tibet, and silks of China. The chests which contained them were of good workmanship, and joined together by dovetail work. The Narrauce, a base silver coin struck in Coos Bahar, is current through Bootan, as in that country there are local prejudices against a mint. It is of the value of about 10d. or one-third of a siaca rupee; the name is derived from the Hindoo mythology.\n\nThe Deb (deva) Rajah who resides at Tussudon is the supreme head of the province, and his authority is obeyed by a considerable part of it, particularly the country adjacent to the road leading from Bengal to the metropolis. With the country to the east and west of this line we are but little acquainted; and it is quite impossible to form any rational estimate of the population, which from the remotely scattered sites of the towns and villages, and the precipitous nature of the country, we may conjecture to be very scanty. The principal towns are Tassudon the capital, Poonakha, Wandipoor, Ghassa, and Murrichom. Pilo is the title given to a provincial governor, and soubah to those of inferior rank.\nThe military weapons of the Booteas are the bow and arrow, a short straight sword, and a falchion reflected like a pruning knife. In war they use poisoned arrows; the poison they procure from a plant as yet unknown to Europeans, and it is an inspissated vegetable juice, in consistence and appearance much resembling crude opium. Their matchlock muskets are very contemptible, and of no use, except in the finest weather when the match will burn, and the priming in an open pan take fire. In the management of the sword and shield they are very dextrous, and most excellent archers. They have wall pieces, but no cannon. A strong jealousy of all intercourse with the inhabitants of Hindostan Proper, prevails universally among the natives on its northern frontier; and it does not appear that Bootan was ever conquered, or even seriously invaded by the Mahomedans.\n\nThere is a remarkable dissimilarity between the feeble bodied and meek spirited natives of Bengal, and their active and Herculean neighbours the mountaineers of Bootan. A strong similarity of features pervades the whole race of the Booteas, who are much fairer and more robust than their Bengalese neighbours, with broader faces and high cheek-bones. They are greatly afflicted with glandular swellings in the throat, from which the natives of Bengal are exempted; it being calculated that one person in six is affected with this distemper.\n\nThe Booteas have black hair, which they cut close to the head. The eye is a very remarkable feature of their faces, small, black, and with long pointed corners, as if stretched and extended by artificial means. Their eye-lashes are so thin as to be scarcely perceptible, and the eye-brow is but slightly shaded. Below the eye is the broadest part of the face, which is rather flat, and narrows from the cheek-bones to the chin. This character of countenance prevails among the Tartar tribes, but is more remarkable among the Chinese. The skins of the Booteas are smooth, and most of them arrive at a very advanced age, before they have even the rudiments of a beard; their whiskers also are of a very scanty growth. Many of them are six feet high; and, taken altogether, their complexions are not so dark by several shades as those of the European Portuguese.\n\nTheir houses are in general but of one story; but the palace of the Deb Rajah, at Tassudon, consists of many floors, the ascent to which is by lofty stairs, which is an unusual circumstance in Bootan. In a country composed of mountains, and abounding with torrents, bridges must necessarily be very frequent; and a traveller has commonly to pass one or more every day's journey. They are of various construction, generally of timber, but sometimes of iron chains.\n\nWoollen cloth for raiment, meat, spirits, and tea, are in use among the Booteas, who are strangers to the subtle niceties and refined distinctions of the Hindoos, which constitute the absurd perplexity of caste. As a refreshment tea is as common in Bootan as in China, but it is made in a very different way from that which Europeans are accustomed to follow. The Booteas make a compound of water, flour, salt, butter, and bohea tea, with some other astringent ingredients, all boiled and beat up together. When they have finished the cup, they lick it in order to make it clean; the higher classes afterwards wrap it up in a piece of scarlet silk. In some instances their medical practice is rendered unpleasant to the physician, who, when the Bootan Rajah takes a dose of physic, is obliged to swallow, however unseasonably, a proportionate quantity of the same medicine.\n\nThe ministers of religion in Bootan are of the sect of Buddha, and a distinct class, confined solely to the duties of their faith. The com-\nmon people pretending to no interference in matters of spiritual concern, leave religion, with all its forms and ceremonies, to those who are attached from early habit to its obligations and prescriptions. Oommaunce paimee oom, a form of words to which ideas of peculiar sanctity are annexed by the inhabitants of Bootan and Tibet, are placed on most of their consecrated buildings. They are frequently also engraved on the rocks in large and deep characters, and sometimes seen on the sides of hills, formed by means of stones fixed in the earth, and of so great a size as to be visible at a considerable distance. In the performance of any religious duty, the Booteas admit of no interruption whatever, which has proved the cause of much delay and inconvenience to those who have had business to transact with their chiefs. (Turner, Saunders, Rennel, &c.)\n\nBooton.\u2014An island in the Eastern Seas, lying off the south-eastern extremity of Celebes, about the 5th degree of south latitude. In length it may be estimated at 85 miles, by 20 miles the average breadth; and it is separated from the Island of Pangausane by a strait, which is passable for square rigged vessels.\n\nThis island is high and woody, but well cultivated, and produces rice, maize, yams, a variety of tropical fruits, and abundance of the wild bread fruit tree, the kernel of which is indigestible. Fowls, goats, bullockos, and fish, are also to be procured here, in payment of which money is preferred by the natives to any species of barter. The inhabitants are very tawny, of short stature, and ugly; their language, on the sea coast, is the Malay, and their religion the Mahomedan. The Dutch had formerly a settlement here in the Bay of Booton, and held the chief of the island under a sort of subjection as an ally. They paid him 150 rix dollars annually, in return for which he permitted them to send an officer annually, named the extirpator, who inspected the woods, and destroyed the clove trees.\n\nOn the east side of this island is a bay, named by the Dutch Dwaal, or Mistake Bay, into which if a ship be drifted by the currents, she cannot get out until the west monsoon sets in, and even then it is difficult. A Dutch governor, going to Banda, was detained in this vexatious gulf a whole year. (Stavorinus, Labeliardiere, Forrest, Bougainville, &c., &c.)\n\nBopal, (Bhupala, a King).\u2014A town in the province of Malwah, 107 miles east of Oojain, the capital of a small state tributary to the Maharattas. Lat. 23\u00b0. 16'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 27'. E.\n\nThis place is extensive, and surrounded with a stone wall, on the outside of which is a large gunge, or mart, with wide and straight streets. On a rising ground to the S. W. on the outside of the town is a fort called Futtchghur, built on a solid rock. It has a stone wall with square towers, but no ditch. To the southwest, under the walls of this fort, is a very extensive tank, or pond, formed by an embankment at the confluence of five streams, issuing from the neighbouring hills. The tank is about six miles in length. The hills in the neighbourhood contain a soft free stone, and a reddish granite, from which issues the small river Patarah, and the Betwah also has its source in this vicinity.\n\nThe town and territory of Bopal are occupied by a colony of Patans, to whom they were assigned by Aurungzebe. In 1790 the revenue of Bopal was estimated at 10 lacks of rupees, but it has been since greatly reduced by the depredations and encroachments of the Maharattas. (Hunter, &c.)\n\nBorea.\u2014A town in the northern extremity of the province of Delhi, situated in the Doab of the Jumna and Sutulege rivers. The country in the neighbourhood, is inhabited by Singhs and Siiks.\nBORNEO, (Varnia).\n\nThe largest of the Asiatic Isles, extending from the seventh parallel of north, to the fourth parallel of south latitude, and from the 109th to the 118th of east longitude. This island is of a more solid compact figure, and not so much indented by arms of the sea as the rest of the Eastern Archipelago, although it possesses many bays and harbours, some of them as yet but little explored. It is surrounded by numberless small islands and rocky islets, many of the latter not larger than a common European house, and in length may be estimated at 750 miles, by the 350 miles, the average breadth.\n\nThe interior of this island being wholly unexplored, we are compelled to trust to the inaccurate communications of the ignorant natives to the Europeans formerly settled on the island, or occasionally visiting the sea-coast on trading voyages. This species of information is obviously not entitled to much attention; from a concurrence of testimony, however, we may infer, that in general, for above 30 miles inland, it continues marshy and covered with jungle, but inhabited, and in some degree cultivated. Further inland it becomes mountainous, and is covered with forests of tall trees, swarming with wild animals, and producing that species of large ape, named by the Malays the orang ootang, or man of the woods. If we may credit the Malay accounts, this centrical tract is also inhabited, as they assert that many of the articles of traffic sold to Europeans are brought from a distance of 20 days journey up the country.\n\nThe rivers of this island best known to Europeans are those of Borneo, Barjarmassin, and Passir, which are ascertained to be navigable for boats above 50, from their junction with the ocean; but they have never been ascended higher by Europeans, and very seldom by Malays. From the nature of the country, it is probable they do not continue navigable much further up, which is an additional obstacle to the examination of the centrical tracts, to those presented by the Mahomedan inhabitants of the sea-coast, who endeavour to monopolize all the traffic, and prevent any intercourse between the natives of the interior and the Chinese or Europeans.\n\nThe climate of the northern part of Borneo much resembles that of Ceylon, being from the abundance of verdure always cool, and not subject to hot land winds, like the coast of Coromandel. It is watered also by a number of fine rivers, several of which fall into the Bay of Maloodoo, without bars. The Sooloos, who pretended to a sovereignty over this part of the coast, many years ago made a grant of it to the English, who never took possession, and the right of the donors thus to dispose of it may reasonably be doubted. In this quarter of the island is the high mountain Keeneebaloo, near to which live the wild idaan, named also maroots, horaforas, or afforce. The whole of this tract, however, to European constitutions is singularly unhealthy.\n\nOn the mainland, on the north coast opposite to Balambangan and Bangney, there are forests of tall timber without underwood, and freestone is also found in abundance. Here are large cattle called lisang, and flocks of deer and wild hogs feed on the extensive plains without fear of the tiger. The country produces all sorts of tropical fruits, and some few species not to be found on the other islands.\n\nThe principal native town is that of Borneo; and the chief European settlements, Passir, Banjarmassin, and Pontiana. Under their respective titles some particulars will be found respecting the commerce and exports of Borneo, and for further miscellaneous details, see the articles, Manggedara, Malloodoo, Paitan, Pappal, and Mampava.\n\nThe sea-coast, and the mouths of\nthe navigable rivers of Borneo, are inhabited by Mahommedans, who receive from Europeans the general name of Malays. They are an impure mixture of Macassars, Javanese, Malays, Arabs, and some converted Biajoos, or aborigines, and are a rapacious, treacherous race, much addicted to piracy, with whom Europeans have never yet been able to establish a secure intercourse. It is a remarkable fact, however, that the unarmed and unprotected Chinese trade without difficulty on a coast so fatal to Europeans; yet the cargoes are valuable, and their vessels defenseless. The chiefs, or rajahs, of these piratical states, possess, each, one or more strong holds, from which they have, assisted by the pestilential climate, repeatedly repelled Europeans, with severe loss. Trading ships, while lying off the coast of Borneo, should be particularly on their guard, and always ready to resist an attack.\n\nThe inhabitants of the interior, or aborigines, have usually received the name of idaan, and in every respect appear to resemble the race of horaforas, or allfoers, as they are termed by the Dutch, being, except the Papuas, in all probability, the most ancient and original race of the Eastern Isles. The idaan are sometimes termed maroot, which is the sanscrit name of the 49 regents of the winds, and companions of Indra. They are a barbarous, but brave and active race, and their language, which is reckoned original, but has no written character, is named, indiscriminately, the biajoo, tiroon, or idaan. They are certainly the original inhabitants of Borneo, and resemble the horaforas in stature, agility, colour, and manners.\n\nThe horaforas are indigenous in almost all the Eastern Isles, and are sometimes found in the same island with the Papuas, or oriental negroes; but the latter have never yet been discovered in Borneo. They are often lighter in colour than the Mahommedan races, and generally excel them in strength and activity. They are universally rude and unlettered; and, when they have not been reduced to the state of slaves of the soil, their manners have a general resemblance.\n\nIn their manners, the most singular feature is, the necessity imposed on every person, of sometime in his life, embuing his hands in human blood; and, in general, among all their tribes, as well as the idaan, no person is permitted to marry, until he can shew the skull of a man he has slaughtered. They eat the flesh of their enemies like the battas of Sumatra, and drink out of their skulls. The ornaments of their houses are human skulls and teeth, which are, consequently, in great request among them; as formerly in Sumatra, the ancient inhabitants of which are said to have had no other circulating medium than the skulls of their enemies. The horaforas are found in all the Moluccas, in Celebes, the Phillipines, and Magindanao, where they are termed sabano or mambo; and the ferocious race, mentioned by Marsden, who live inland from Samanka in Sumatra, and are accustomed to atone for their own faults, by offering the heads of strangers to the chiefs of villages, are probably of the same description.\n\nThe Sooloos assert, that the idaan of the interior believe that their gods are pleased with human victims, and that several in poorer circumstances will club together to buy a Philippine slave, or any other person that is to be sold cheap, that all may partake in the merit of the execution. Their arms are long knives and soompittans, a tube of wood about six feet long, through which they blow small arrows, poisoned at one end; having, at the other, a small bit of cork wood, just large enough to fill up the hollow of the tube. They are generally well acquainted with poisons. The poisonous juice used for this purpose is extracted from a tree, which has not yet been\nascertained by Europeans, and the wound caused by it is mortal.\n\nThese idaan, although of such barbarous and sanguinary habits, are not mere savages. They cultivate the earth, and raise fruits and vegetables, which they carry to the seacoast, and exchange with the Biajoos and Malays for salt; this article in lumps passing in the market for currency. These idaan rear hogs, and sympathize with the Europeans when they see them eat pork, which the Malays hold in abhorrence; but they consider the latter advanced a step beyond themselves in civilization, as having a religion, while they have, in fact, not any.\n\nThe Biajoos may be considered as the same race with the idaan and horaforas, their manners being somewhat diversified by the nature of their pursuits, which are those of a maritime life. They are in reality a species of sea gipsies, or itinerant fishermen, who live in small covered boats, and enjoy a perpetual summer on the Eastern Ocean, shifting to leeward from island to island, with the variations of the monsoon. In some of their customs, this singular race resemble the natives of the Maldivie Islands. They annually perform their offering to the god of evil, by launching a small bark, loaded with all the sins and misfortunes of the nation, which are imagined to fall on the unfortunate crew that may be so unlucky as to meet with it.\n\nThe Biajoos, on the north-west coast of Borneo, are more civilized than the others; and, when the English colony at Balambangan existed, used to supply it with rice, fowls, and other provisions; by the Malays they are named oran lait, or men of the sea. These fishing Biajoos have boats of about five or six tons, with whole families on board, who fish for swallo, or sea slug, in seven and eight fathoms water. They also dive for it; the best, which is the black, being procured in deep water, some of them of the weight of half a pound. It is sold to the Chinese at four and five dollars per pecul, (133\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) pounds). Some Biajoos dwell close to the sea on the islands round Borneo, and at the mouths of rivers, their houses being raised on posts. Many of this last class have become converts to the Mahommedan religion.\n\nOn the north-east coast of Borneo is a savage people, named orang tidong, or tiroon, who appear to be another variety of the Biajoo race. They reside up the rivers, and fit out piratical vessels to cruise among the Philippines, and on the north-east coast of Borneo. They are a hardy race, and subsist mostly on sago during their cruizes. The Mahomedans of Magindanao and the Illanos affect to despise them; but when they meet among the Philippines, which are their common prey, they do not molest each other. They are described as eaters of human flesh occasionally. Their boats are small, and the planks are sewed together, of which they take pieces and carry overland, when enclosed in any of the bays by the Spanish armed vessels. Their conduct to their prisoners is cruel in the extreme, often mutilating the stoutest, or leaving them to perish on some sandy desert island. They sell a great deal of sago to the Sooloo islanders, who afterwards dispose of it to the Chinese junks.\n\nThere remains another class of Biajoos, who wander about Celebes, Borneo, and the Philippines, and who are composed of a medley of different nations; such as Chinese, with long plaited hair; Javanese, with bare throats, plucked beards and whiskers; and Macassars, with black shining teeth. Their religion is said to be Mahommedan and Chinese; and their boats are managed by the women as well as the men.\n\nComparing the state of this island in civilization and cultivation with other parts of India, the population of which is ascertained, although of\nso immense a size, we cannot assign a greater number than three millions to the inhabitants of Borneo; not including in the estimate the orang outangs, which some authors assert is also a cooking animal.\n\nThe inhabitants of the north coast of Borneo have a tradition, that their country was once subject to China; but when first visited by the Portuguese, in 1530, they found the Mahomedan religion firmly established all along the sea coast.\n\nThe Dutch had formerly a settlement at Banjarmassin; and, in 1778, obtained Landak and Succadana by cession from the King of Bantam, whose ancestors in remote times had conquered them. They sent a small force to take possession of them, and erected a fort at Pontiana; but, like many other of their establishments, they never realized profit from it equal to the expense incurred; yet among the exports are enumerated rough diamonds, camphire, benzoin, canes, iron, copper, bezoar, sago, wax, bird nests, and gold. (Forrest, Dalrymple, Leyden, Stavorinus, Wilcocke, Elmore, &c.)\n\nBorneo.\u2014A town on the N.W. coast of the Island of Borneo, situated 10 miles up a river of the same name. Lat. 4\u00b0. 56', N. Long. 114\u00b0. 44'. E. The river is navigable far above the town for ships of burthen; but the mouth is narrow, and has a bar, over which there is scarcely 17 feet at high water. Up to the town, the water is salt, and the tide runs at the rate of four miles an hour. In the middle is six fathoms water; and here lie moored, head and stern, the Chinese junks, four or five of which, about 500 tons burthen each, arrive annually from Amoy. These junks carry to China a great quantity of black wood, which is worked up into furniture; also rattans, dammer, clove bark, swallo, or biche de mar, tortoise-shell, bird nests, and excellent native camphire. On account of the goodness and plenty of timber, the Chinese frequently build junks, some so large as 500 tons, which they load with the rough produce of the island, and send to China. This industrious people have many proper gardens in the neighbourhood of the town, keep shops both on board their ships and on shore, and infuse life into the town. By a proper management, it is probable, that woollens might be conveyed through this channel into China.\n\nThe houses of this town are built on each side of the river upon posts, and are ascended by stairs and ladders. It resembles Venice, in having small water channels in place of streets; and all traffic is transacted on board of boats, which float up and down the river with the tides, and are in general managed by women.\n\nThe captains and supercargoes of European trading-ships should be careful of venturing on shore here, nor should they on any account take their ships up the river, for fear of treachery. The Malay and Chinese vessels, trading to this port, hang a bag of lime in the water close toward under each bow, which, impregnating the water around, in their opinion keeps off the worm.\n\nThe form of government at this place is difficult to understand. The chief person is styled cang de patuan, and the second sultan; then come the paugerans, or nobles, 15 in number, who tyrannize over the people. Formerly there was an English factory here, but it has long since been abandoned. (Forrest, Elmore, 4th Register, &c.)\n\nBorow.\u2014A town in the province of Gujrat, 27 miles N.W. from Cambay. Lat. 22\u00b0. 33'. N. Long. 72\u00b0. 22'. E.\n\nBoujepoor, (Bhojapura).\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, district of Shahabad, 68 miles W. from Patna. Lat. 25\u00b0. 36'. N. Long. 84\u00b0. 9'. E.\n\nBouslagur, (Bhonslaghar).\u2014A large grand village in the province of Gundwana, 110 miles S. from Ruttunpoor. Lat. 20\u00b0. 40'. N. Long. 82\u00b0. 28'. E.\nAbout this place the streams are observed to run westward, the country being drained into the Godavary; to the north of this the little rivers run eastward, and fall into the Mahanuddy. From Coukair to this place, a distance of 40 miles, there is not a single habitation that can be called even a hamlet. A hut or two are observed here and there, with small spots of land somewhat cleared; where the Goonds, having cut down the trees to within three feet of the ground, and having interwoven the branches, so as to fence their plantations against the incursions of wild beasts, clear a spot, and cultivate a little maize. (Blunt, &c., &c.)\n\nBoutan.\u2014A high round island, with several smaller ones near it, lying off the north-east coast of the Malay Peninsula. Lat. 6\u00b0. 32'. N. Long. 95\u00b0. 10'. E.\n\nBowal.\u2014A village in the province of Bengal, district of Dacca Jelalpore, 20 miles N. by E. from the city of Dacca. Lat. 23\u00b0. 57'. N. Long. 90\u00b0. 23'. E. The country surrounding this place swarms with game of all sorts, among which may be enumerated elephants, tigers, leopards, bears, buffaloes, wild boars, deer of many varieties, foxes, hares, jackals, tiger cats; and, of the feathered tribes, florekins, peacocks, the domestic fowl in a wild state, different sorts of partridges, snipes, quail, wild ducks, teal, and wild pigeons.\n\nBrahmapootra River.\u2014The largest river of India, known in Tibet by the name of the Sanpoo. The sources of this river have never been explored, but it is probable they are separated from those of the Ganges only by a narrow range of snow clad peaks, about the 32d degree of north latitude, and 82d of east longitude. From hence the Brahmapootra takes its course eastward through the country of Tibet, north of the Himalaya Mountains, where it is known by the name of Sanpoo, or Zanchoo, which is understood to mean the river, as Gunga is among the Brahminical sect of Hindoos. In its course eastward, it passes to the north of Teshoo Loomboo, the residence of Teshoo Lama, where it is stiled Enchoomboo, and thence flows in a wide-extended bed, through many channels, and forming a multitude of islands. Its principal channel is described as narrow but deep, and never fordable. At this place it receives the tributary waters of the Painomitchieu, and many other streams, before it passes Lassa, and penetrates the frontier mountains that divide Tibet from Assam. In this part of its course it takes a vast circuit through the mountains, before it enters the latter kingdom, and approaches within 220 miles of Yunnan, the most western province of China. Here it turns suddenly west through Assam, where it receives a copious supply from that region of rivers, before with increased volume it rushes, to the notice of Europeans, below Rangamatty, on the borders of Bengal. From hence it hastens to meet the Ganges; these rivers being nearly related in their birth, as well as united in their termination.\n\nAfter entering Bengal, it makes a circuit round the western point of the Garrow Mountains, and then altering its course to the south, in the Dacca province, is joined by the Megna, which, although not the 10th part of its size, most unaccountably absorbs its name, and communicates its own to the great mass of waters, until they intermix with those of the Ganges, near the Bay of Bengal. The whole known course of this river, including its windings, may be estimated at 1650 miles; but it is the fate of the Brahmapootra to penetrate a rude climate and stubborn soil, seldom approaching the habitation of civilized men; while the Ganges, on the contrary, flows along a fertile territory, and through rich and polished nations. Until 1765 the Brahmapootra\nwas unknown in Europe as a capital river of India.\n\nThis river, during a course of 400 miles through Bengal, bears so intimate a resemblance to the Ganges, that one description answers both, except that, during the last 60 miles before their junction, under the name of Megna, it forms a stream, which is regularly from four to five miles wide, and, but for its freshness, might pass for an arm of the sea. The junction of these two mighty rivers below Luckipoor now forms a gulf interspersed with islands, some equal in size to the Isle of Wight. The Bore, which is a sudden and abrupt influx of the tide into a river or narrow strait, prevails in the principal branches of the Gauges, and in the Megna; but the Hooghly River, and the passages between the islands and sands, situated in the gulf, formed by the confluence of the Brahmapootra and Ganges, are more subject to it than the other rivers. (Turner, Rennel, &c., &c.)\n\nBrahminabad.\u2014The extensive ruins of Bambarah, in the province of Tatta, are supposed to be those of the ancient city of Brahminabad, named also Manhawar and Mahawar by Persian authors. Lat. 24\u00b0 46'. N. Long. 67\u00b0 50'. E. In the 10th century Brahminabad was the capital of a powerful Hindoo kingdom. (Kinner, Wilford, Ferishta, &c., &c.)\n\nBraila.\u2014A small island, lying off the eastern coast of Malacea. Lat. 4\u00b0 55'. N. Long. 103\u00b0 46'. E.\n\nBrambanan.\u2014A village in the district of Mataram, in the Island of Java, and nearly in the centre of the latter. It stands at the northern base of a range of mountains, running east and west to a great extent, and called, by the Javanese, from their position, the Mountains of the South.\n\nAt this place are many extraordinary remains of Hindoo images, temples, and inscriptions. The area occupied by the ruins of all descriptions, is equal to 10 miles. Over this surface there are scattered, at various distances, the ruins of several temples; but the most remarkable ruins are known to the natives by the name of the Thousand Temples. This collection constitutes a square group of buildings, each measuring about 250 paces. In the centre of the square stood one large temple, which was surrounded at equal distances by three square rows of smaller ones, each row but a few feet distant from the other. At each of the four cardinal points, where there appeared to have been once gates, were two gigantic statues, named by the Javanese Gopala, one of the names of Krishna. Each of them had a mace in his hand, and a snake twisted round his body.\n\nIn the large temple there are no images; but, from the remaining pedestals, it appears there once were some. The inside walls were adorned with figures of the conch shell, of water vases, and of the sacred lotus, all indicating a Hindoo origin. On the outside of the large temple are figures of Brahmins. In some of the small temples, there are still some images; and among the other ruins there is a group of large temples, one of which still contains an entire figure of Bhavari, and another of Ganesa; on an adjacent building are sculptured many Hindoo figures in relief. About a mile and a half distant from the Thousand Temples there is another cluster of buildings, close to which is an oblong slab of granite, seven feet long and three broad, one face of which is covered with an inscription, asserted to be the common Devanagari character, containing a legend from the Mahabharat; other stones with inscriptions are also scattered about.\n\nThe stones of these buildings are of hewn granite, admirably well cut and polished, and laid on each other with great skill and nicety. No mortar has been made use of, but, instead of it, the lower surface\nof each stone has a prominence, which fits accurately into a groove in the upper surface of the one underneath, by which contrivance the stones are firmly retained in their situations. The roofs of the temples are all, like the rest of the building, of hewn granite; and it is in their construction that the greatest skill has been displayed. Everything regarding these ruins is wrapped in the greatest obscurity. The fabulous accounts of the Javanese ascribe them to a person celebrated in their romances, whom they name Bandung, whose skill in magic is said to have raised them in one night. A Javanese manuscript asserts them to have been erected in the Javanese year 1188 (A.D. 1261).\n\nThe neighbourhood of Brambanan, to the extent of 20 miles, is cultivated with cotton, which is here produced in greater abundance, and of better quality, than in any other part of the island. The village of Brambanan is, in fact, the first, if not the only mart in Java for cotton, which is here known by the Hindu name of Kapas. (Edinburgh Review, &c.)\n\n**Brodrath.** (Brodera).\u2014A town in the province of Gujrat, district of Champaneer, 40 miles N.N.W. from the city of Broach. Lat. 22\u00b0. 13'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 24'. E. This is the capital of a Maharatta Chieftain, known by the family name of the Guicowar (Gaikevad), who divides with the peshwa and the British the largest and finest portion of Gujrat; his particular share lying principally in the northern districts. In Aurangzebe's reign this was a large and wealthy town, and still continues a place of considerable trade, but we have no detailed description of it.\n\nPillajee Guicowar (the great-grandfather of the present Guicowar) invaded the province of Gujrat in 1726, and in 1730 was confirmed in his conquest by Sahoo Rajah, the grandson of Sevajece, and reigning sovereign of the Maharattas. Pillajee was succeeded by his son Damajee, who was taken prisoner by the Peshwa Bajerow, but afterwards ransomed, and received a sumed for the half of Gujrat. His successor was his son Futteh Singh, who dying in 1789 was succeeded by his brother Manajee, who died in 1792, when another brother, named Govind Row, ascended the throne. This chief died in 1800, and was succeeded by his son, Anund Row Guicowar, who still continues at the head of the government.\n\nThis state was first noticed in the political transactions of the British about the year 1782, when, at the peace concluded with the Maharatta Chiefs of Poonah, it was stipulated, that the established Jaghire of Futteh Singh Guicowar (who had sided with the British) should continue in his possession, the said Futteh Singh Guicowar performing the same obedience, and paying the same tribute to the peshwa as had before been customary. By the treaty of Bassin, concluded with the peshwa on the 31st of December, 1802, the British engage to arbitrate and adjust all differences between the peshwa and Anund Row Guicowar.\n\nIn 1802 Malhar Rew commenced hostilities against Anund Row, and took possession of Vessanagur. The latter solicited the assistance of the British, and a detachment was sent, which defeated Malhar Row, expelled him from the Guicowar's country, and took the fort of Kurrce and the rest of his possessions. An alliance was then formed with the Guicowar, who made several cessions of territory to reimburse the expense incurred by the British, and consented to receive and support a subsidiary force of 2000 regular infantry, and also to reduce an expensive corps of Arabians, which he had in his service. By this treaty it was determined, likewise, that all the Guicowar's political arrangements at Poonah should be conducted by the British Resident,\nconjunctly with the Guicowar's Va-\nkeel.\n\nBy a supplementary treaty, con-\ncluded on the 18th of February,\n1803, between the Guicowar, and\nMajor Walker on the part of the\nBritish, the following districts were\npermanently ceded for the support\nof the subsidiary force, viz.\n\nThe pergunnah of Dolka,\nyielding a revenue of - 450,000\nDitto of Neryad - - - 175,000\nDitto of Bejapoor - - - 130,000\nThe Tuppa of Kurree, con-\ntiguous to Bejapoor - 25,600\n\nRupees 789,000\n\nOn the 2d of June, 1803, the\nGuicowar agreed to subsidize an ad-\nditional body of 1000 infantry, for\nthe payment of which the following\ndistricts were made over;\n\nThe pergunnah of Matter,\nvalued at - - - - 130,000\nDitto of Modha - - - 110,000\nThe customs of Kunkatodra, north of the Tuppa 50,000\n\nRupees 290,000\n\nThe actual extent of the Gui-\ncowar's influence, and the limits of\nhis remaining territories, it is almost\nimpossible to discriminate, and de-\npend greatly on the talents of the\nreigning prince. His claims to tri-\nbute are very indefinite, and extend\nover the whole province; but the na-\nture of the government being wholly\nfeudal, only occasional obedience is\npaid by his vassals, who are more\nkept in awe by his alliance with the\nBritish, than from any dread of his\nown intrinsic resources. What re-\nvenue he receives is generally col-\nlected by the presence of a military\nforce, and but a small portion of it\never reaches the treasury at the ca-\npital. (Marquis Wellesley, Treaties,\n&c., &c.)\n\nBroach, (Barigosha).\u2014A district\nin the province of Gujrat, situated\nbetween the 21st and 23d degrees\nof north latitude, and bounded on\nthe west by the Gulf of Cambay. In\n1582 it is described by Abul Fazel\nas follows:\n\n\"Sircar Behroatch, containing 14\nmahals, measurement 349,771 bee-\ngahs, revenue 21,845,663 dams,\nSeyurghal 141,820. This sircar fur-\nnishes 990 cavalry, and 20,800 in-\nfantry.\"\n\nThis is one of the best cultivated\nand populated territories on the\nwest coast of India; and was ac-\nquired finally by the British, at the\ntreaty of peace concluded with\nDowlet Row Sindia, in December,\n1803. As a particular favour, the\npeshwa was allowed to retain the\npergunnahs of Ahmood, Jumbosier,\nand Dubboi, being old fiefs of his\nfamily; and even the town of Olpar,\nwithin seven miles of Surat. This\nintermixture of dominion is not un-\ncommon in Hindostan, but was al-\nways more customary among the\nMaharattas, than any other nation.\n\nA smaller tract of country, imme-\ndiately adjacent to the city, is pro-\nperly called the district of Broach.\nThree-fourths of this territory, con-\ntaining 122 villages, are named ka-\nnum lands, which possess a rich soil,\npreferable to the Barra land, close\nto the sea. The annual govern-\nment assessment upon kanna land,\nin constant cultivation, is 12 rupees\nper acre; but, after a year of fallow,\nit is double that rate. Land which\nis allowed to lie fallow is named\nvassell, in contradistinction to that\nnamed bhoot, which is tilled every\nseason. The crop on the first, is\ndouble that on the last, and the\nrent in proportion. About the town\nof Broach, a begah (one-third of an\nacre) of common vassell, is assessed\nat eight rupees, and one of bhoot at\nfour rupees. To raise this double\nproduce, the spot must also be im-\nproved by exposure, irrigation, and\nmanures.\n\nForty villages, bordering on the\nsea-coast, compose the division of\nAmilseer and Packajin; and their\nsoil and climate are considerably different, from the rest of the marit ime tract. In this particular territory, which is named Barra, cultivation does not commence until August and September. On this species of land, the government assessment may generally be averaged at three rupees per begah, or one guinea per acre. The soil in the districts of Broach, Jumbosier, and the adjacent ones east of the Gulf of Cambay, suits extremely well with the cultivation of cotton; which is sown on fallowed spots along with rice, the latter being of speedy growth, and reaped at the opening of the rainy season. The grassia lots of land in the Broach district in 1804, exempted from the revenue assessments, amounted to 58,000 begahs.\n\nThe number of violent deaths and robberies in this district, have greatly decreased since it has fallen under the British government. In former times, the delinquents being almost universally punished by the infliction of fines, by no means proportioned either to the crime or to the amount of their property, the rich could commit crimes with impunity; at present the punishments being personal, their apprehensions of the consequences are much greater.\n\nWhen sinking under the weight of years, or absorbed in spiritual contemplation, Hindoo devotees not unfrequently descend into a pit dug by themselves or disciples, and then submit to be smothered alive. This is related of Kuveer, from whose tooth-pick the natives assert sprung the great tree, on an island in the Reva or Narmada, of which the following is a description:\n\nOn an island in the Nerbuddah, 10 miles from the city of Broach, stands the famous banyan tree, supposed to be the largest and most extraordinary in existence. It is named Kuveer Bur, in honour of a famous saint, and was formerly much larger than at present; for high floods have at different times carried away the banks of the island where it grows, and along with them such parts of the tree, as had extended their roots so far. What still remains is about 2000 feet in circumference, measuring round the different stems; but, the hanging branches, the roots of which have not yet reached the ground, cover a much larger extent. The chief trunks of this tree amount to 350, all superior in size to the generality of English oaks and elms; and the smaller stems, forming strong supporters, are more than 3000, and from each of these new branches hanging roots are proceeding, which time will form trunks, and become the parents of a future progeny. This is the tree described by Milton in Paradise Lost; and the natives have a tradition that is 3000 years old, and assert that 7000 persons can repose under its shade.\n\nBeing so conveniently situated, the Bombay government made many attempts to obtain this district, and had possession of it for a short time prior to 1782; but, at that period, in order to procure the concurrence of Madhajee Sindia to the treaty of Salbey, Broach with its valuable territory yielding a revenue 200,000l. was a private and separate agreement ceded to him. (Dunnmond, Lord Valentia, Moore, 5th Register, &c.)\n\nBroach.\u2014A town in the province of Gujrat, district of Broach, of which it is the capital, situated on the north bank of the Nerbuddah River, about 25 miles above its junction with the sea. Lat. 21\u00b0 41'. N. Long. 75\u00b0 6'. E.\n\nThis place is said to derive its name from the Hindoo saint or devotee Bhrign, and to be properly written Bhrigu Kshetra or Bhrigu-prana, the town or place of Bhrigu. It is thought to have been the Barygaza of the ancients, and when it surrendered to the Emperor Acher, in 1572, continued to be a place of great trade.\n\nVery fine bafts and other cotton\ngoods are manufactured here, and the waters of the Neruddah are said to have a peculiar property in bleaching clothes to a pure white. At Broach the hire of an able-bodied man for the whole day is seven piece, or 4d. English; a woman five piece, and boys and girls from a haltpenny to 2d.; the whole of which rates are almost double those of Bengal, in the manufacturing districts. The price of food for common occasions is from one to two farthings per pound, and on festivals they can afford a relish of milk or fish.\n\nAt the period of the great famine, in 1791, the number of houses in the district immediately attached to the town of Broach was 14,835, and the inhabitants 80,922. After the famine, it was found that 2351 of the former had been abandoned, and that 25,295 of the latter had died. In 1804, the whole number of residents in Broach fort and the environs was reported to be 22,468 souls, but at present it is believed to be more than double that number. The town and district immediately attached to Broach may be estimated to contain 100,000 inhabitants. In 1807, there were 25 nats, or societies, in Broach, of the banyan caste, comprehending 5261 individuals of both sexes; and, by a census taken the same year, it was found there were 3101 parcels of the mobid (sacerdotal) and behdeen classes, (laity) in the city and suburbs.\n\nAt this place there is a pinjrapole or hospital for animals, supported by donations from the Hindoo inhabitants. Every marriage and mercantile transaction is taxed for the pinjrapole, by which above 1000l. is raised annually, a great portion of which is absorbed into the coffers of the managers. The only animals it at present contains, are milk cows, which yield the expense of their keeping. In the surat pinjrapole, the only animals kept that cost anything, are a few wild bulls, and some monkeys.\n\nBy the treaty concluded with the Peshwa, and the combined Maharatta powers in June, 1782, the city and pargannah of Broach, were ceded to the East India Company. In July, 1782, they were made over to Madhajee Sindia, ostensibly as a recompense for his humane treatment of the British prisoners and hostages taken at Wurgauum; but, in reality, for his assistance in bringing about the pacification, which, at that time, on account of Hyder's invasion of the Carnatic, was urgently wanted.\n\nIn 1772, Broach was besieged by an army from Bombay, commanded by General Wedderburne, who was killed under the walls; and a few days after his death, it was captured by storm, although then a place of very considerable strength. It remained in the possession of the British until 1782, when it was ceded, along with the district to Madhajee Sindia, at the treaty of Salbey; but was again taken from his successor, Dowlet Row, on the 29th August, 1863, by the army under Colonel Woodington, and has remained with the British ever since.\n\nTravelling distance from Bombay 221, from Oujain 266, and from Poonah 287 miles.

During the night, however, it was most informally stormed by a sailor of the name of Strahan, who, happening to get drunk, wandered up to the breach, and fired a pistol at some of the garrison, who, supposing he must be followed by the whole army, fled out by the opposite side, and left him in possession of the place.

It is formed of the whole circular mentioned by Abul Fazel under the name of Ahmedabad Gohrah, with three-fourths of that of Callinger, stretching north to the southern banks of the Jumna, over an extent of 11,000 square miles.\n\nThe country is high and mountainous, and but imperfectly cultivated. The summits of the hills, though mostly rocky, are covered with small coppice wood, there being few timber trees of a large size. About Adyghur the whole of the Ghauts, and almost every hill in this part of Bundelcund, is a table land, and the country one of the strongest in the world, every hill being a natural fortress from their great height and steepness. The face of the country presents a heavy close jungle; the soil, in many places, but not generally, is rich, and produces a number of teak trees, which appear to be of the bastard kind, being of stunted growth.\n\nThis district is comprehended between the Betwah and Cane rivers, but has no river of magnitude flowing through it. The south-western frontier towards Gundwana begins a few miles south of the village of Dowra. Lat. 24\u00b0. N. Long. 80. 45'. E. The famous diamond mines of Pannah, in the time of Acher valued at eight lacks of rupees, are within this district, but are not now so productive; the other chief towns are Chatterpoor, Teary, and Jyghtpoor, Callinjer, Jhansi, Dulteen, and Bejaonr. Under the chiefs who ruled in the last and preceding centuries, the government of this country was denominated the Hindupati of Bundelcund, the rajahs being of the Bundela tribe of Rajpoots. The founder of this family was Rajah Beer Singh, from whom the family of the Oorcha chief is descended. The greater part of his dominions was wrested from him by Rajah, who was the last sole possessor of the Bundelcund province, then estimated to produce a land revenue of one crore (10 millions) of rupees annually. At that period its capital was Callinger, one of the strongest fortresses in Hindostan; but the residence of the rajah was the city of Purna, or Pannah, situated above the Ghauts, and celebrated from all antiquity for its diamond mines.\n\nDuring the government of Rajah Chuttersal, Bundelcund was invaded by Mahommed Khan Bungish, the Pattan chief of Furruckabad, and the peshwa Sewai Bajerow was invited from the Deccan to assist in repelling the invasion. When this was accomplished the rajah adopted the peshwa as his son, and divided his territory between his two sons, Birdee Sah and Juggeth Sah, and the peshwa, his son by adoption. The two portions assigned to Birdee and Juggeth Sah continued to be held by their numerous descendants, or by the nominal adherents and declining branches of that family, until a long series of domestic dissension and civil war in the Bundelcund province had prepared it for subjugation by a foreign power.\n\nMadhajee Sindia, during his last and successful attempt in 1786 on the expiring Delhi sovereignty, was accompanied by a strong detachment of Deccany troops, under the command of Ali Bahadur, an illegitimate grandson of the first Peshwa Bajerow, by a Mahommedan woman. The peshwa's object, in marching this body of troops, was to obtain possession of the northern dis-\ntricts of the Doab, of the Ganges, and Jumna, to be governed by Ali Bahauder as his representative.\n\nIn the army of Madhajee Sindia was also the late Rajah Himmut Bahauder, a powerful commander of a large body of horse, and of a numerous party of gosains, or nangas, a peculiar class of armed beggars and religious devotees, and of whom Rajah Himmut was not only the military leader, but also the spiritual head. This chief falling under the suspicion of Sindia, to escape seizure and imprisonment, took refuge under the Zireen Putka, or principal banner of the Maharatta empire, which had been entrusted by the peshwa in this expedition to Ali Bahauder, and is always guarded by a select body of troops. In consequence of this measure, a breach ensued between Sindia and Ali Bahauder, whose views on the Doab were wholly frustrated, Sindia determining to establish his own independent authority in that country.\n\nAli Bahauder, thus disappointed of aggrandisement in Upper Hindostan, prepared to return to Poonah, but destitute of funds for the support of his army. When, in this distress, Rajah Himmut Bahauder suggested to him the entire conquest of Bundelcund, of which country he was a native; and an agreement was concluded betwixt them, by which a large portion of the province was, when conquered, to be consigned to the independent management of Himmut Bahauder, and the revenue appropriated to the support of the troops, which he engaged to maintain in the service of Ali Bahauder.\n\nThe distracted and turbulent state of the province was such, that an invitation was soon received from one of the contending parties, and the invasion undertaken A.D. 1789. In a short time, the country was nearly wholly subdued, but it required several years before the Maharatta authority could be properly established in a region where every village was a fortress, and, in fact, according to European ideas, its reduction never was accomplished.\n\nAt this period an arrangement was made with the Peshwa, by which he was acknowledged the sovereign and paramount lord of all the conquests made by Ali Bahauder in Bundelcund, who engaged to obey him and furnish a tribute, but neither of these conditions were, in fact, ever fulfilled. In the meantime, Rajah Himmut Bahauder, afraid that the return of tranquillity would bring about the downfall of his own power, was continually exciting disaffection and disturbances in all the districts subject to the Maharattas, in which he was well seconded by the restless and turbulent dispositions of the native chiefs.\n\nThe Nabob, Ali Bahauder, died in 1802, during the blockade of Calcutta, which he was unable to take, having been 14 years employed in the reduction of Bundelcund; at the end of which time his progress was no greater than it had been in the third year. Shamsheere Bahauder, his eldest son, was then in his 18th year, and resident at Poonah; and Rajah Himmut Bahauder, whose influence was now predominant, appointed a distant Mahommedan relation, named Ghunee Bahauder, as regent during his absence.\n\nAt this period the war of the British with Dowlut Row Sindia and the other Maharatta chiefs originated, consequent to the treaty of Bassein with the peshwa; and it appeared the intention of Holkar to use the influence of Shamsheere Bahauder, as a means of invading the British possessions in the Benares province through Bundelcund. Rajah Himmut Bahauder also foreseeing the annihilation of his own power by the success of the latter, determined to endeavour to effect the transfer of that province to the British, on securing an advantageous indemnity to himself.\n\nWhen affairs were in this state, a proposal on the part of the peshwa\nwas made for a cession of a portion of territory in Bundelcund, in lieu of the districts in the Deccan which had been ceded by the treaty of Bassecin. This proposal having been accepted by the British government, a deed of cession to the East India Company of territory in Bundelcund of 32 lacks and 16,000 rupees in place of the subsidy, and of four lacks of rupees for the expense of subduing it. By this arrangement the peshwa, whose authority over the conquests of Ali Bahauder had been hitherto merely nominal, and who had never derived any revenue from it, was enabled to liquidate the claims of the British government, for the payment of the subsidiary force which protected his hereditary possessions.\n\nThe occupation of the province of Bundelcund during the war, by the British troops, became necessary for the defence of the countries in the Doab; as well as of the town and district of Mirzapoor, and the city of Benares, which were all exposed to invasion from this quarter. Nor without it could the secure navigation of the Jumna be depended on, from the restless and turbulent characters of the Bundelah chiefs.\n\nSubsequent to this period, while the British detachment was occupied with the siege and conquest of Calpee, a conciliatory negociation was opened with Shunshere Bahauder, to whom a territory of four lacks of rupees per annum was secured in the peshwa's remaining share of Bundelcund, of which he was afterwards appointed governor. With the Soubahdar of Jhansi, and the Rajahs of Dulteen and Sintheer, conciliatory arrangements were also concluded, and a short time afterwards with the Rajahs of Churkaree, Jeytpoor, and Bejaour. By the measures adopted every hereditary chieftain, who possessed power or influence in Bundelcund, has been conciliated or subdued, and placed in due subjection to the British authority.\n\nRajah Himmut Bahauder died in 1804, after which his territories were resumed by the British government, his irregular troops disbanded, and his family provided for. In 1805 the estimated revenue of the British portion of Bundelcund was as follows, viz:\n\n| Districts                  | Revenue       |\n|----------------------------|--------------|\n| Calpee                     |              |\n| Ryepoor                    |              |\n| Jumna                      | 1,400,000    |\n| Rajah Himmut Bahauder      | 1,533,184    |\n| Callinjer, Jeypoor, Buldei |              |\n| Cntolee                    |              |\n| Ghants                     |              |\n| Jaghires                   |              |\n| Provisions                 |              |\n| Native leaders             | 500,000      |\n| City and diamond mines     |              |\n| Pannah                     |              |\n| Territory adjacent         |              |\n| Probable revenue           | 200,000      |\n\nRupees 3,633,184\n\nIn 1807 a considerable tract of country in this province, containing numerous villages above the Ghants, and some diamond mines, was granted to Rajah Kishore Singh, the descendant of Rajah Hirdce Sah, and the ancient family of Bundelcund, but who had long been dispossessed by different chiefs, under the condition that he would guard the passes, and suppress all marauders and disturbers of the public peace. At this time considerable progress had been made in restoring tranquillity to this long distracted country, by the reduction of the district of Koonch, and the expulsion of the refractory zemindars, which was completed, in 1810, by the capture of Callinjer.\n\nIn 1804 Bundelcund was formed into a British district, subordinate to the Benares court of circuit, and a civil establishment appointed for\nthe administration of justice, and collection of the revenue.

(Leckie, &c.)\n\n**Bunnass River.**\u2014This river has its source in the province of Ajmeer; in passing through which it attains to a very considerable bulk, and even when pursuing its course from Deesa, through the Mehwass, its size is not insignificant; but it afterwards loses itself in the Kakreze, and by the time it reaches Rahdunpoor is dwindled to a small stream.\n\nThree miles below Rahdunpoor the bed of the river is about half a mile in breadth; but not more than 20 yards of this space, in the dry season, contains water. The current at this period is rather rapid, and about two and a half feet in depth; the water is of an excellent quality. The banks, at this part of its course, are nearly on a level with the surrounding country, which is inundated during the rains to the extent of two miles. (M. Murda, &c.)\n\n**Bunnoo.**\u2014A town in the province of Cabul, district of Bungshat, 33 miles west from the Indus. Lat. 32\u00b0 56'. N. Long. 70\u00b0 20'. E.\n\n**Buntwalla.**\u2014A town in the province of South Canara, 17 miles from Mangalore. Lat. 12\u00b0 48'. N. Long. 75\u00b0 9'. E. This place contains about 300 houses, and is situated on the north bank of a river passing Arcola, which is named the Netrawati. The tide flows no higher than Arcola; but canoes, carrying 150 bushels of rice, can at all seasons ascend 10 and 11 miles from Nagara. The channel is very wide and full of rocks, which in the dry season form many islands. This town is fast improving, being the thoroughfare for the trade between Mysore and Canara; the inhabitants are mostly Brahmins, but of an inferior caste. (F. Buchanan, Lord Valentia, &c.)\n\n**Bunwoot.**\u2014An island about 18 miles in circumference, lying off Pollok Harbour, in Magindanao. Lat. 7\u00b0 14'. N. Long. 124\u00b0 28'. E.\n\nOn the 12th September, 1775, this island was ceded to Capt. Thomas Forrest, for the East India Company, by the sultan and government of the City of Magindanao; the grant being written in Spanish by a native of Pampanga, once a slave, but who obtained his liberty by turning Mahomedan. This island is covered with tall trees, clear of underwood, and, at the date of the grant, was uninhabited. There are few springs, but many ponds of fresh rain water;\nand it abounds with wild hogs, monkeys, guanos, and small snakes about 13 inches long. In this state it probably remains, as it was never taken possession of. (Forrest, &c.)\n\nBuralle.\u2014A town in the Nizam's territories, in the province of Berar, 67 miles S. W. from Ellichpoor. Lat. 20\u00b0 36' N. Long. 77\u00b0 32' E.\n\nBurdee.\u2014A town in the province of Allahabad, situated on the south side of the same river, 60 miles S. S. W. from Benares. Lat. 24\u00b0 37' N. Long. 82\u00b0 27' E. The country around this place is very desolate, and much covered with jungle. The Burdee rajah's territories are intermixed with those of the Company. (Blunt, &c.)\n\nBurdwan, (Vardhaman, productive).\u2014A district in the province of Bengal, situated between the 22d and 24th degrees of north latitude. It is bounded on the north by Birboom and Ranjeshy; on the south by Midnapoor and Hooghly; on the east by the River Hooghly; and on west by Midnapoor and Pachete.\n\nIn 1784, this district contained 5174 square miles, according to Major Reauncl's measurement; and, in proportion to its dimensions, is the best cultivated, and most productive of any similar extent of territory in India. It became subject to the British government, along with the other ceded lands, in 1760. It is environed by the jungles of Midnapoor in Orissa, of Pachete, and Birboom, and appears like a garden surrounded by a wilderness. It produces grain, cotton, silk, sugar, and indigo, in great abundance, and of excellent quality. The weaving of mixed goods, made with silk and cotton, flourishes at several towns in this district.\n\nThe zemindary, or estate, known by the name of the Burdwan zemindary, on a rough estimate, may be taken at 73 miles long and 45 broad, comprehending about 3280 miles, nearly the whole of which is in a high state of cultivation, and well stocked with inhabitants. Subsequent to 1722, it was bestowed on KeeruChund, of the Khetri or military caste, the first known progenitor of the present family; and, in 1790, the existing rajah paid a yearly rent to government of 400,000l. sterling. In 1784, the revenue of the whole district was 4,358,026 current rupees. The chief towns are Burdwan, Bissunpoor, and Keerpay; and the principal rivers, the Hooghly and Dummoodah; but this district has not generally the advantage of a good inland navigation; the commerce, however, has been much facilitated and extended by the opening of three grand roads leading to Hooghly, Culna, and Cutwa.\n\nIn 1802, from the number of villages, and of the houses in each village, the inhabitants were estimated at 1,780,000, supposing each house to contain four inhabitants, which is too low an average. The actual number probably exceeds two millions, one-sixteenth of whom are supposed to be Mahommedans. There are no brick or mud forts in this district; but the remains of several are visible, originally constructed for protection against the Maharattas.\n\nThe only persons possessing rank are the Rajahs of Burdewan and Bissunpoor; but neither of these now maintain many followers in their service. For purposes of state or ceremony, when they appear abroad they hire a retinue; but before the introduction of the permanent system, the number of persons called zemindary pykes, employed for police and other purposes, was above 21,000. The other zemindars are of no considerable rank; many of the principal manage their estates by means of an agent, having their own residence in Calcutta. There are many considerable native merchants, who carry on an extensive commerce in salt, tobacco, grain, and cloth; but the indigo works are entirely managed by Europeans. The peasantry are peculiarly opulent.\nThere are few villages in this district in which there is not a school where children are taught to read and write; but there are no schools for instruction in the Mahommedan or Hindoo law. The most learned of the latter are found in the adjacent district of Nuddea, from whence and from Benares the other stations are supplied. The Mahommedans bear but an inconsiderable proportion to the mass of inhabitants, and receive their education in the common branches, from the village schoolmasters, or from their own relations. Gang robbery is the crime most prevalent in this, as in all the lower districts of Bengal.\n\nThat this district continues in a progressive state of improvement, is evident from the number of new villages erected, and the increasing number of brick buildings, both for domestic and religious purposes. To Burdwan must be assigned the first rank in all India, for productive agricultural value, in proportion to its size; the second may be claimed by Tanjore. (E. Thompson, J. Grant, Colebrooke, 5th Report, Lord Cornwallis, &c.)\n\nBurdwan.\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Burdwan, 60 miles N. N. W. from Calcutta. Lat. 23\u00b0. 15'. N.

It is distant five miles from Moorshedabad. (Lord Valentia, &c.)\n\nBurias.\u2014One of the Philippine Isles, lying due south of Luzon. Lat. 13\u00b0. N. Long. 123\u00b0. E. In extreme length it may be estimated at 43 miles, but the average breadth does not exceed nine miles. Although this island is situated in the very centre of the Philippines, and so near to the great Island of Luzon and its capital Manila; yet, in 1775, it was possessed by a colony of piratical Ilanos cruisers from Mindanao, the Spaniards not having been able to dislodge them. This island is surrounded with rocks and shoals to a considerable distance. (Forest, &c.)\n\nBurmoor.\u2014A small fortified village on the frontiers of the province of Cuttack. Lat. 20\u00b0. 21'. N. Long. 85\u00b0. 10'. E. The whole way from this place to Khussunghur may be called a pass; but that part, named Burmool Ghaut, is more particularly strong. The entrance is 600 yards from Burmool, and it continues near a mile. It is formed by two lofty mountains, almost perpendicular, 200 yards from each other, between which the road lies.\n\nBurramootee.\u2014A large town in the province of Bejapoor, 44 miles S.

On the north it is separated by hills and forests from the territories of the Goorkhali Rajah of Nepaul. This territory was ceded to the Company by the treaty concluded on the 10th Nov. 1801, between the Nabob of Oude and the Marquis Wellesley.\n\nBUXAR.\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, district of Shahabad, situated on the S. E. side of the Ganges. Lat. 25\u00b0. 35'. Long. 83\u00b0. 58'. E.\n\nThe fort of Buxar, though of very inconsiderable size, commands the Ganges; but it is now dismantled, nor is there a single fortified place between Calcutta and Allahabad. Every boat passing up and down the Ganges is obliged to come to at this place, and produce her pass; every traveller by land does the same, the police being very strict.\n\nA celebrated victory was gained here, in Oct. 1764, by the British forces under Major, afterwards Sir Hector Munro, over the united armies of Sujah ud Dowlah and Cossim Ali Khan. The British army consisted of 856 Europeans and 6215 sepoys, of whom 87 Europeans and 712 sepoys were killed and wounded; the combined troops were computed at 40,000 men, 2000 of whom are supposed to have been slain in the battle.\n\nThe flight of the allies was so rapid, that they did not stop at Buxar, but hastened to a nullah (small river) beyond it, which being very full, many were drowned and slaughtered in attempting to pass. The plunder was very great, as they left their tents standing, and their whole train of artillery, consisting of 133 pieces of various sizes, were taken.\n\nA native historian describes the camp of the two chiefs in the following terms: \"A bridge of boats being thrown over the Ganges, the allied armies began their march in numbers not to be reckoned; but, from the ignorance of the generals, and want of discipline, murdering and plundering each other. It was not an army, but rather a moving nation.\"\n\nTravelling distance from Benares, 70 miles; from Calcutta by Moorshedabad, 485; by Birboom, 408 miles.

Long. 19\u00b0. 29'. E.\nBuxedwar is a place of great natural strength, and, being a frontier station of these mountains, has been rendered stronger by art. The village consists of 10 or 12 houses, invisible until the very moment of approach. It is placed upon a second table of levelled rock, upon which is very little soil; yet it is covered with verdure, in consequence of its sheltered situation, surrounded on three sides by lofty mountains, and open only to the south, which affords a narrow prospect of Bengal.\n\nThe country continues flat to the foot of the Buxedwar Hill. The ascent to Santarabarry is easy, but the road afterwards becomes abrupt and precipitous, the hills being covered with trees to their summits. At Santarabarry are extensive orange groves, and raspberry bushes are found in the jungles.

Long. 88\u00b0.\n\nThis place formerly belonged to Chandah, and the country still bears that name, though they are now separate soubahdarries. It is considered by the Maharattas, whose authority is well established here, as a strong town, and consists of about 300 thatched and tiled houses. It has a stone fort on the north-west side, under the east face of which runs the Kobragur, which afterwards falls into the Wainy, or Baum Gunga.\n\nByrahgur is a place of some traffic, and much frequented by Brinjarries from Choteesgur, and the northern circars. The trade is principally in cotton, which is brought from the north-west parts of Berar and Choteesgur. This is purchased by merchants from the circars, who give in exchange salt, betel, and cocoa nuts. (Blunt, &c.)\n\nCABUL.\n\nA large province in Afghanistan, situated betwixt the 33d and 35th degrees of north latitude. On the north it is bounded by Kuttore, or Caffristan; on the south, by Candahar and Ballooehistan; to the east it has the Indus; and to the west, the Hindoo Kho Mountains, and province of Bamian, in Persia. In length it may be estimated at 250 miles, by 150 the average breadth.\n\nIn 1582, this province is described by Abul Fazel as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Cabul is situated in the third and fourth climates. The length, from Attock Benares, on the banks of the Sinde, to Hindoo Kho, is 150 coss; and the breadth, from Carabagh to Chuganserai, 100 coss. On the east lies Hindostan; on the west, inclining to the north, are mountains, between which is situated Ghour; on the north is Inderab of Badakhshan, and Hindoo Kho; on the south, Fermed and Nghz. The water and air of this province...\"\nare excellent. The parts in which snow falls, and those which are entirely free from it, are so near to each other, that you may pass from heat to cold in the course of a day. The snow begins to fall in the mountains in September, but not in the plains until November.\n\n\"The fruits of this country are delicious, excepting the melons, but the harvests are not very flourishing. The surrounding mountains and wilds defend Cabul from sudden invasion. Hindoo Koh lies in the centre, between Cabul, Badakhshan, and Balk. There are seven roads from Tooran to Cabul, and six from Cabul to Hindostan. No less than 11 languages are used in the viceroyalty of Cabul, each nation speaking its own; viz. Turkish, Mughooly, Persian, Hindy, Alghanece, Pushtowey, Purvatchy, Guchree, Burkee, Lunghance, and Arabic.\n\n\"The natives are chiefly of the tribes of Hezarch and Afghan, which possess all the pasturage. The tribe of the Hezarch are the remains of the Chaghtai army, which Maungu Khan sent to the assistance of Holakoo Khan, and they inhabit the country from Ghizni to Candahar, and are upwards of 100,000 families. The Afghans say they are descended from the children of Israel. Some Afghans consider themselves to be of Egyptian extraction, asserting, that when the children of Israel returned from Jerusalem to Egypt, this tribe migrated to Hindustan.\n\n\"Sircar Cabul, containing 22 mahals; revenue, 80,507,465 dams. Seynburghal, 137,178 dams. This sircar furnishes 28,187 cavalry, and 217,700 infantry.\"\n\nThe country of Cabul, in respect to its natural geography, is divided into two parts, separated by a ridge of very high mountains usually covered with snow, which runs from west to east from the neighbourhood of Ghizni to that of Deenkote on the Indus, below Attock. The tract lying to the north of this is named Lunghanat, and to the south Bun-gishhat; each having one or more considerable rivers intersecting their whole length, and disemboguing themselves into the Indus. That of Lunghanat is the River of Cabul, named also the Kameh, and in its lower part the Attock; that of Bun-gishhat is the Cow, or Cowmull River.\n\nCabul is a country highly diversified, being made up of snowy mountains, hills of moderate height, extensive plains and forests. From the Indus to the city of Cabul there is an invariable deficiency of wood, insomuch that the lower class of people, in the winter season, suffer much from a want of fuel. Near Baranow there is a sandy, uninhabited valley, 20 miles in length. The air in the country around Gundamouck is probably strongly impregnated with nitrous particles, the exposed part of the body being covered with a white scaly substance of a saline taste, which excoriates the skin. The chief towns are Cabul and Peshawer; and the principal rivers have been already mentioned.\n\nThe central districts about the capital, possessing few Indian commodities, receive sugar and cotton cloths mostly from Peshawer, whither they send iron, leather, and tobacco. To Candahar are exported iron, leather, and lamp oil, whence the returns are made in sundry manufactures of Persia and Europe. The Tartars of Bochara bring to Cabul the horses of Turkistan, furs, and hides, the latter resembling those termed in Europe Bulgar; the proceeds are applied to the purchase of indigo, and other productions of Hindostan.\n\nThe roads throughout this province are much infested by the native Afghans, a most ungovernable race, and averse to all peaceful occupations. This particularly applies to a sect named the Hybers, who are greatly aided in the pursuit of a free-booting life by the situation of their country, which forms a chain\nof mountains, whose scanty slips of valley affords but little food. This rude race of men still dwell in caves, or in the fissures of rocks. They profess the Mahommedan religion of the Sooni persuasion, and hate the Persians, and all the sectaries of Ali. The Hyber dialect is founded on the common language of the Afghans, but is harshly guttural, and ill understood by the adjacent tribes.\n\nThe province of Cabul, on account of its mountainous surface, was originally named Roh, from whence is derived the term Rohillah; it is also sometimes named Zabulistan from Zabul, one of the names of Ghizni.\n\nIn A.D. 997, when Cabul was invaded by Sebuctagi, the first sovereign of the Ghizni dynasty, the eastern quarter of this province, although situated to the west of the Indus, was still occupied by Hindoos, subject to a prince of that religion named Jypal, whose capital was named Bathinda, and whose dominions extended, in a north-west direction, from Lahore to Lunnghanat, and in a south-east line from Cashmere to Mooltan. The whole was finally subdued by Sultan Mahmood about A.D. 1008, and it was severed from the Delhi empire by Nadir Shah in 1739. (See Afghanistan.)\n\nIn 1809, in consequence of the confederacy with the state of Persia, projected by the French, for the purpose of invading the Abdalli dominions in Afghanistan, and ultimately those of the British government in India, the Honourable Mountstuart Elphinstone was dispatched as ambassador to the Cabul court, on the part of Lord Munro, then governor-general, for the purpose of concerting with the Cabul government the means of mutual defence against the expected invasion of the French and Persians, and of explaining the friendly and beneficial object of his mission.\n\nThe Cabul sovereign, sensible of the advantage of alliance and cooperation between the two states, directed his ministers to confer with Mr. Elphinstone, and, consulting the welfare of both governments, to conclude an arrangement. It was in consequence agreed, that, if the French and Persians endeavoured to pass through the Cabul territories, the armies of that state should use the utmost exertion to repel them, and prevent their effectuating this object; and that if, in pursuance of their confederacy, the enemy should advance towards the King of Cabul's country, in a hostile manner, the British state shall hold themselves liable to afford the expenses necessary for the above-mentioned service, to the extent of their ability; these conditions to be in force while the confederacy between the French and Persians continued. (Foster, Rennell, Abul Fazel, Treaties, Stewart, Scott, &c. &c.)\n\nCabul.\u2014A city in Afghanistan, the capital of the province of Cabul. Lat. 34\u00b0.31'. N. Long. 68\u00b0.34'. E. In 1582 it is described by Abul Fazel as follows:\n\n\"Cabul is a very ancient and beautiful city, of which Pusheng is said to be the founder. There are double walls of mud of considerable strength; on the south-east side is a small hill, named Shah Cabul. From early antiquity, Cabul and Candahar have been reckoned the gates of Hindostan; one affording entrance from Tooran, and the other from Iran.\"\n\nThis city at present is the residence and capital of the Abdalli sovereigns of Afghanistan. It stands in a wide plain, well watered, and interspersed with walled villages.\u2014The Cabul River runs through the plain, over which, at the distance of four or five miles to the southward of the city, is a bridge built of brick. It is surrounded by a wall about one mile and a half in circumference, and is situated on the eastern side of a range of two united hills of a semicircular figure. The fortifications are of a very simple construction, with\nscarcely any ditch; the houses are built of rough stones, clay, and unburned bricks, and exhibit a very mean appearance.\n\nBalare-sir, the name of the king's palace, stands on a rising ground in the eastern quarter of the city, and does not at all correspond to the view with the dignity of its master. Ali Mirdan Khan, a celebrated nobleman in the reign of Jehanger, erected here four spacious bazars in the centre of the city, which were supplied with fountains; the last are now choked up with filth, and the first occupied by the meanest order of mechanics. The fruits in the market are of a good kind, and in great plenty, as apples, pears, peaches, pomegranates, and a variety of grapes. The environs of the city are chiefly occupied by garden grounds, and watered by numerous streams, the largest of which runs through the town, and has a small bridge over it. To the S.W. of Kabul the hills are of a moderate height, but the country is thinly cultivated. On account of the proximity of this capital to the Indian Caucasus, or Hindoo Kho Mountains, the temperature of the atmosphere is liable to very sudden variations.\n\nThe great bazar here is frequently crowded with Usbeck Tartars, who have the same cast of features as the Chinese and Malays, but more harsh; and here are to be found the remains of a colony of Armenians, captured by Nadir Shah during his Turkish wars. Many Hindoos frequent this city, chiefly from Peshawer, who contribute greatly to its prosperity, and are carefully protected by the Afghan government.\n\nTravelling distance from Delhi, 839 miles; from Agra, 976; from Lucknow, 1118; and from Calcutta, 1815 miles. (Foster, Rennel, Abul Fazel, &c.)\n\nCABUL RIVER.\u2014This river has its source in the western part of Kabul, near the Hindoo Kho Mountains, and flows past the city of Kabul, from whence it proceeds in a S.W. course towards the Indus, which it joins in front of the town of Attock, after receiving the addition of many streams. From Jalalabad down to Peshawer its proper name is Kanuch, after which it is frequently named the Attock, and Hindostan commences at its junction with the Indus. At Jalalabad it is navigable for jalehs, or rafts of a particular construction; and its whole course, including the windings, may be estimated at above 300 miles.\n\nCABYNA.\u2014A small island about 21 miles in length, by 15 in breadth, lying due south of the eastern limb of Celebes.

To the north it is bounded by Assam, and to the south by the Cassay country; to the east by Cassay, and to the west by the districts of Tipperah and Silhet, in the province of Bengal. Its dimensions are uncertain, but are known not to be great.\n\nA communication exists by water through Assam to the centre of both Cachar and Gentiah, although hitherto deemed inaccessible even by land. Formerly the commerce betwixt Bengal and Cachar was carried on by land from Silhet; for the Assamese at that period were so jealous of their Bengal neighbours, that no access whatever was allowed through the Brahmapootra.\n\nAlthough so far to the east, and for many centuries almost completely interdicted all communication with Hindostan, the inhabitants of this country are, like their neighbours the Cassayers, Hindoos of the Brahminical persuasion. The Rajah of Cachar, who is a Khetri of the Suryabansi (Children of the Sun) race, nevertheless occasionally sends several gayals to be sacrificed on certain hills in his country. The Cachar country is fertile, but greatly overgrown with jungle, and thinly\npopulated. It is much less known than its immediate vicinity to the province of Bengal would lead us to expect. The name of the capital is Cospoor.\n\nIn 1774 Oundaboo, the general of Shembnau, the reigning Burman monarch, unencumbered with baggage or artillery, marched against Chewal, the Rajah of Cachar; who possessed the sovereignty of a productive though mountainous country, north-west of Munipoor. In his advance he overcame Anoup Singh, prince of a country called Mugge-loo, and advanced within three days march of Cospoor, the metropolis of Cachar. Here he was opposed by Chewal, leagued with the Gossain Rajah; and his troops being attacked by the hill fever, (a disease fatally known to the British troops), his army was dispersed, cut off in detail by the natives, or perished by disease.\n\nA second expedition under Kameonza (another general) was more successful, who, arriving at the pass of Inchamutty, within two days march of Cospoor, the Rajah Chewal consented to pay, besides a sum of money, the homage of a maiden of the royal blood to the King of Ava, and also to send him a tree with the roots bound in the native clay, as an unequivocal proof of vassalage. (Symes, Wade, Colebrooke, &c.)\n\nCadutinada, (or Cartinaadu).\u2014A small district in the Malabar province, the rajah of which resides at Kuliporam. It is tolerably well cultivated, and is naturally a rich country, but does not produce grain adequate to the sustenance of the inhabitants. The higher part of the hills are overgrown with wood, which the Nairs formerly encouraged, as affording them protection against invaders. In the hills which form the lower parts of the Ghauts in Cadutinada, and other northern districts of Malaya, are certain places that naturally produce cardamoms.\n\nThe female Nairs in this part of the country, while children, go through the ceremony of marriage both with Nambouries and Nairs; but here, as well as in the south, the man and wife never cohabit. When the girl is come to maturity, she is taken to live in the house of some other Namburi or Nair. A Nair here is not astonished when asked who his father was, and a man has as much certainty that the children born in his own house are his own, as a European husband has; yet, such is the perversity of custom, that he would be considered as unnatural, were he to have as much affection for his own children, as for those of his sister, which he may perhaps never have seen. In 1761, the Bombay government concluded a treaty with the chief of this country, for the purchase of pepper, in which he is stiled the King of Cartenadu. (F. Buchanan, Treaties, &c.)\n\nCaffristan, (or Kuttore).\u2014An extensive mountainous country, bounding Kabul to the north; the general level of which is considerably elevated above the countries on each side of it, and extending northward from the 35th degree of north latitude.\n\nKuttore appears to be the general name of this tract, which has the Seward, Bijorc, and Puckoli districts to the south, and extends from the north west frontier of Kabul to Cashmere. It has also obtained the name of Caffristan, or the land of infidels, from the Mahomedans. It is classed as a dependency of Cashgar, by the people of Hindostan, but seems to have been but little known to them. The expedition of Timour to the mountains of Kuttore is particularly related by Sherifeddin; by which it appears, that Timour proceeded from Badakhshan to Kawuck or Khawick, the furthest or most eastern of the passes, leading through the Hindoo Kho Mountains, into the province of Kabul. In order to arrive at the fortress of Kuttore, he crossed several ranges of high mountains, rising one above the\nother, some of them covered with snow. The fortress was situated at the foot of the further range, having a river of great depth and rapidity close under its walls.\n\nSince this remote period, we have heard very little of these Alpine regions; we may conclude, however, that they have contributed their share of military adventurers to the invading armies of Hindostan. At present we are ignorant of the nature of their government, the number of inhabitants, and the religion they profess. The Mahommedan is the most probable; but, as Kuttore borders on Tibet, where the doctrines of Buddha under the Lama hierarchy prevail, it is likely there is an intermixture of the latter sect. The nature also of the country gives us reason to suppose it is possessed by numerous petty and independent chieftains, the leaders of hostile clans or tribes, in a state of perpetual warfare with each other. None of the eastern conquerors ever reduced this country into a state of permanent subjection, nor does the object seem adequate to the trouble and difficulty.\n\n**Calagody, (Calaghudi).**\u2014A town in the province of Tinnevelly, 113 miles N.

Fort William, its citadel, stands in Lat. 22\u00b0. 33'. N. Long. 88\u00b0. 28'. E.\n\nThe local situation of Calcutta is not fortunate, for it has extensive muddy lakes, and an immense forest close to it; and was at first deemed hardly less unhealthy than Batavia, which it resembled in being placed in a flat and marshy country. The English, it has been remarked, have been more inattentive to the natural advantages of situation than the French, who have always in India selected better stations for founding their foreign settlements. The jungle has since been cleared away to a certain distance, the streets properly drained, and the ponds filled up; by which a vast surface of stagnant water has been removed, but the air of the town is still much affected by the vicinity of the Sunderbunds.\n\nThe city stands about 100 miles from the sea, on the east side of the western branch of the Ganges, named by Europeans the Hooghly River, but by the natives the Bhagirathi or true Ganges, and considered by them peculiarly holy. At high water the river is here a full\nCALCUTTA.\n\nraile in breadth; but, during the ebb, the opposite side to Calcutta exposes a long range of dry sand banks. In approaching Calcutta from the sea stranger a is much struck with its magnificent appearance; the elegant villas on each side of the river, the Company's botanic gardens, the spires of the churches, temples, and minarets, and the strong and regular citadel of Fort William. It exhibited a very different appearance in 1717, of which the following is a correct description:\n\nThe present town was then a village appertaining to the district of Nuddca, the houses of which were scattered about in clusters of 10 or 12 each, and the inhabitants chiefly husbandmen. A forest existed to the southward of Chandpaul Ghaut, which was afterwards removed by degrees. Between Kidderpoor and the forest were two villages, whose inhabitants were invited to settle in Calcutta, by the ancient family of the Seals; who were at that time merchants of great note, and very instrumental in bringing Calcutta into the form of a town. Fort William and the esplanade are the site where this forest and the two villages above-mentioned formerly stood. There are still inhabitants alive, who recollect a creek which extended from Chandpaul Ghaut to Balliaghaut; and who say, that the drain before the government-house is where it took its course. To the south of the Beytakhanah there is still a ditch, which shews evident traces of the continuation of this creek. In 1717 there was a small village, consisting of straggling houses, surrounded by puddles of water, where now stand the elegant houses at Chowringhee; and Calcutta may, at this period, be described as extending to Chitpore Bridge, but the intervening space consisted of ground covered with jungle. In 1742 a ditch was dug round a considerable part of the boundaries of Calcutta, to prevent the incursions of the Maharattas; and, it appears from Mr. Orme's history of the War in Bengal, that at the time of its capture in 1756, there were about 70 houses in the town belonging to the English. What are now called the esplanade, the site of Fort William and Chowringhee, were so late as 1756 a complete jungle, interspersed with a few huts, and small pieces of grazing and arable land.\n\nThe modern town and suburbs of Calcutta extends along the east side of the river above six miles, but the breadth varies very much at different places. The esplanade between the town and Fort William leaves a grand opening, along the edge of which is placed the new government-house erected by the Marquis Wellesley; and, continued on in a line with this edifice, is a range of magnificent houses, ornamented with spacious verandahs. Chowringhee, formerly a collection of native huts, is now an entire village of palaces, and extends for a considerable distance into the country. The architecture of the houses is Grecian, which does not appear the best adapted for the country or climate, as the pillars of the verandahs are too much elevated, to keep out the sun during the morning and evening, although at both these times the heat is excessive; and, in the wet season, the rain beats in. Perhaps a more confined Hindoo style of building, although less ornamental, might be found of more practical comfort. The principal square extends about 500 yards each way, and contains in the centre an extensive tank, surrounded by a handsome wall and railing, and having a gradation of steps to the bottom, which is 69 feet from the top of its banks. A range of indifferent looking houses, known by the name of the Writer's Buildings, occupies one side of the square; and near to it, on the site of the old fort, taken by Seraje ud Dowlah, in 1757, is a custom-house and several other hand-\nsome buildings. The black hole is now part of a warehouse, and filled with merchandise. A monument is erected facing the gate, to commemorate the unfortunate persons who there perished; but it has been struck by lightning, and is itself fast going to decay. A quay has been formed in front of the custom-house, which promises to be a great improvement; and it would be a still greater, were the embarkment extended along the whole face of the town next the river.\n\nThe government-house is the most remarkable public edifice in Calcutta. The lower story forms a rustic basement, with arcades to the building, which is ionic. On the north side there is a flight of steps, under which carriages drive to the entrance; and, on the south, there is a circular colonnade with a dome. The four wings, one at each corner of the building, are connected with it by circular passages, so long, as to secure their enjoying the air all round, from whichever quarter the wind blows. These wings contain all the private apartments; and in the north-east angle is the council-room, decorated like the other public rooms with portraits. The centre of the building contains two uncommonly fine rooms: the lowest is paved with dark grey marble, and supported by doric columns chunamied, resembling marble. Above this hall is the ball-room, floored with dark polished wood, and supported by ionic pillars. Both rooms are lighted by a profusion of cut glass lustres, suspended from the painted ceiling, where an excellent taste is displayed in the decorations.\n\nBesides the government-house the other public buildings are a town-house, the court of justice, and two churches of the established religion, one of which makes a very handsome appearance, but the other is a plain building. There are also churches for the Portuguese Catholics, another of the Greek persuasion, an Armenian church, and many small Hindoo temples and Mahommedan mosques. The hospital and jail are to the south of the town. The botanic garden is beautifully situated on the west bank of the river, and gives the name of Garden Reach to a bend of the river. Above the garden there is an extensive plantation of teak, which is not a native of this part of India, but which thrives well here. There is a private dock-yard nearly opposite to Fort William, and another one mile below it on the same side of the river.\n\nThe black town extends along the river to the north of Calcutta, and exhibits a remarkable contrast to the part inhabited by the Europeans. It is extremely large, and swarming with population. The streets are narrow, dirty, and unpaved; the houses of two stories are of brick, with flat-terraced roofs; but the great majority are mud cottages, covered with small tiles, with side walls of mats, bamboos, and other combustible materials. Fires are, consequently, of frequent occurrence, but do not in the least affect the European quarter, which, from the mode of building, is wholly incombustible. In this part the houses stand detached from each other within a space enclosed by walls, the general approach being by a flight of steps under a large verandah, their whole appearance being uncommonly elegant and respectable.\n\nBricks, mortar, and wood, are not scarce in Calcutta, yet the money sunk in building a house is very considerable; and, being a perishable commodity, requiring constant repair, house rent is proportionally high. The white ants are so destructive in their operations, that, sometimes, every beam in a house may be completely excavated internally, while outwardly it appears perfectly sound.\n\nFort William stands about a quarter of a mile below the town, and is superior in strength and regularity to any fortress in India. It is of an\noctagon form, five of the faces are regular, while the forms of the other three next the river are according to the local circumstances. As no approach by land is to be apprehended on this side, the river coming up to the glacis, it was merely necessary to guard against an attack by water, by providing a great superiority of fire, which purpose has been attained by giving the citadel towards the water the form of a large salient angle, the faces of which enfilade the course of the river. From these faces the guns continue to bear upon the object till it approaches very near the city, when they would receive the fire of batteries parallel to the river. This part is likewise defended by the adjoining bastions, and a counter-guard that covers them.\n\nThe five regular sides are towards the land; the bastions have all very salient orillons, behind which are retired circular flanks, extremely spacious, and an inverse double flank at the height of the berme. This double flank would be an excellent defence, and would serve to retard the passages of the ditch, as from its form it cannot be enfiladed. The orillon preserves it from the effect of ricochet shot, and it is not to be seen from any parallel. The berme opposite to the curtain serves as a road to it, and contributes to the defence of the ditch like a fausse-bray.\n\nThe ditch is dry, with a cunette in the middle, which receives the water of the river by means of two sluices that are commanded by the fort. The counterscarp and covered way are excellent, every curtain is covered with a large half-moon, without flanks, bonnet, or redoubt, but the faces mount 13 pieces of heavy artillery each, thus giving to the defence of these ravelins a fire of 26 guns. The demi-bastions, which terminate the five regular fronts on each side, are covered by a counter-guard, of which the faces, like the half-moons, are pierced with 13 embrasures. These counter-guards are connected with two redoubts, constructed in the place of arms of the adjacent re-entering angles; the whole is faced and palissadoed with care, kept in admirable condition, and capable of making a vigorous defence against any army, however formidable. The advanced works are executed on an extensive scale; and the angles of the half moons being extremely acute, project a great way, so as to be in view of each other beyond the flanked angle of the polygon, and capable of taking the trenches in the rear at an early period of the approach.\n\nThis citadel was commenced by Lord Clive soon after the battle of Plassey, and was intended by him to be complete in every respect, but it has since been discovered that it is erected on too extensive a scale to answer the purpose for which it was intended, that of a tenable post in case of extremity, as the number of troops required to garrison it properly would be able to keep the field. It is capable of containing 15,000 men, and the works are so extensive that 10,000 would be required to defend them efficiently, and from first to last have cost the East India Company two millions sterling. The works are scarcely at all raised above the level of the surrounding country, of course do not make an imposing appearance from without, nor are they perceptible until closely approached. This excites great surprise in the natives coming from the interior, who always connect the idea of great strength with great elevation, and generally mistake the barracks for the fort.\n\nThe fort only contains buildings that are absolutely necessary; such as the residence of the commandant, quarters for the officers and troops, and the arsenal. The barracks make a very handsome appearance, and afford excellent accommodation both to the privates and officers. The interior of the fort is perfectly open, presenting to the view large grass\nplots and gravel walks, kept cool by rows of trees; and, in the finest order, intermixed with piles of cannon, bomb shells, and balls. Each gate has a house over it, destined for the residence of a major. Between the fort and town an extensive level space intervenes, called the Esplanade.\n\nThe garrison usually is composed of two or three European battalions, one of artillery, with artificers and workmen for the arsenals. The native corps, amounting to about 4000 men, are generally cantoned at Barrackpoor, 15 miles higher up the river, and supply about 1200 monthly to perform the duty of the fort. The wells in the different outworks of Fort William, some of which are 500 yards from the river, during the hot season become so brackish as to be unfit either for culinary purposes, or for washing. Government has, in consequence, formed an immense reservoir, occupying one of the bastions, to be filled when required with rain water.\n\nCalcutta possesses the advantage of an excellent inland navigation, foreign imports being transported with great facility on the Ganges, and its subsidiary streams, to the northern nations of Hindostan, while the valuable productions of the interior are received by the same channels. There are seldom less than one million sterling in cloths belonging to native merchants deposited in Calcutta for sale, and every other species of merchandise in an equal proportion. The total capital belonging to the native monied and commercial interests has been estimated to exceed 16 millions sterling, which is employed by them in the government funds, loans, and discounts to individuals, internal and external trade, and in various other ways. The formerly timid Hindoo now lends money on respondentia, on distant voyages, engages in speculations to various parts of the world, ensures as an underwriter, and erects indigo works in different parts of the provinces. He has the advantage of trading on his own capital with much greater frugality than a European; and, exclusive of the security of his property, enjoys the most perfect toleration of his religion. In Sept. 1808, the Calcutta government bank was established with a capital of 50 lacks of rupees, of which government have 10 lacks, and individuals the remainder. The notes issued are for not less than 10 rupees, or more than 10,000. Further commercial information, with the details of the external commerce of the port of Calcutta, will be found at the conclusion of this article.\n\nThere have been various opinions as to the population of Calcutta, but it does not appear any very correct census has ever been taken. In 1802 the police magistrates estimated the population of Calcutta at 600,000; a few years ago Sir Henry Russel, the chief judge, estimated the population of Calcutta and its environs at one million; and Gen. Kyd the population of the city alone at between four and 500,000. Probably half a million will be a tolerably correct approximation to the real number. The adjacent country is also so thickly inhabited that, in 1802, the police magistrates calculated that Calcutta, with a circuit of 20 miles, comprehended 2,225,000 souls.\n\nThe number of houses, shops, and other habitations in the town of Calcutta, in 1798, belonging to individuals, was as follows:\n\n| Category                  | Number |\n|---------------------------|--------|\n| British subjects          | 4300   |\n| Armenians                 | 640    |\n| Portuguese and other Christian inhabitants | 2650 |\n| Hindoos                   | 56,460 |\n| Mahomedans                | 14,700 |\n| Chinese                   | 10     |\n\nTotal 78,760\n\nThe above statement does not include the new and old forts, and many houses the property of the East India Company.\nThe European society in Calcutta is numerous, gay, and convivial, and the fetes given by the governors-general splendid and well arranged. Each of the principal officers of government have their public days for the reception of their friends, independent of which not a day passes, particularly during the cold season, without several large dinner parties being formed of from 30 to 40. A subscription assembly also subsists, but it is unfashionable, although it is the only place of public amusement, the society being much subdivided into parties.\n\nIt is usual, in Calcutta, to rise early in order to enjoy the cool air of the morning, which is particularly pleasant before sunrise. Betwixt one and two a meal is taken, which is called tiffin, after which many retire to bed for two or three hours. The dinner is commonly after sunset, which necessarily keeps the guests up until midnight. The viands are excellent, and served in great profusion; and as the heat of the climate does not admit of their being kept, great part are at last thrown out to the pariah dogs and birds of prey. The lower orders of Portuguese, to whom alone they would be serviceable, cannot consume the whole; and the religious prejudices of the native servants prevent their tasting any food belonging to a person not of their caste or religion. To this circumstance is to be attributed the amazing flocks of crows, kites, and vultures, which, undisturbed by man, live together in amicable society, and almost cover the houses and gardens. In their profession of scavengers the kites and crows are assisted, during the day, by the large adjutant stork, and at night by pariah dogs, foxes, and jackals, which then emerge from the neighbouring jungles.\n\nThe wines chiefly drank are Madeira and claret; the former, which is excellent, during the meal, the latter afterwards. The claret being medicated for the voyage, is by some considered too strong. The Calcutta market supplies a great variety of game, such as snipes, wild ducks, partridges, and various species of the ortolan tribe\u2014the whole comparatively cheap. The wild venison is much inferior to that of Britain, but the park or stall fed is equally good. The hare is a very poor animal, and differs in many qualities from that of England, being deficient in size, strength, and swiftness, which observation also applies to the Bengal fox. The tables of the gentlemen in Calcutta are distinguished by a vast profusion of most beautiful fruits, procured at a very moderate expense, such as pine apples, plantains, mangoes, pomeloes, or shaddock, melons of all sorts, oranges, custard apples, guavas, peaches, and an endless variety of other orchard fruits.\n\nThe usual mode of visiting is in palanquins, but many gentlemen have carriages adapted to the climate, and the breed of horses has lately been greatly improved. It is universally the custom to drive out between sunset and dinner, and, as it becomes dark, servants with torches go out to meet their masters, and run before their carriages with an astonishing rapidity, and for a great length of time. It was formerly the fashion (and it is still adhered to in the country) for gentlemen to dress in white cotton jackets on all occasions, being well suited to the climate, but being thought too much of an undress for public occasions, they are now laid aside for coats of English cloth.\n\nThe British inhabitants stationary in Calcutta, and scattered throughout the provinces, are generally hospitable in the highest degree, and most liberal where their assistance is wanted. When an officer of respectability dies, in either service, leaving a widow, or children, a subscription is immediately commenced, which, in every instance, has proved generous, and not unfrequently has conferred on the parties a degree of af-\nfluencee, that the life of the husband or parent could not for many years have accomplished.\n\nThe Company grant a princely allowance to their civil servants, but, large as it is, it does not always suffice for the expenses of the juniors; many of whom, on their first arrival, set up an extravagant establishment of horses, carriages, and servants, and thereby involve themselves in embarrassments at a very early period of their lives. To support this profuse manner of living they are obliged to borrow from their Dewan, who is generally a monied native of rank, who supplies their extravagance, and encourages their dissipation, until their difficulties are almost inextricable. While the young civilian remains in an inferior situation, the debt to the Dewan continues to accumulate; and when higher appointments are at length attained, it requires years to clear off the embarrassments of his juvenile thoughtlessness. Instances of this sort are rare now compared to what they were at an early period of the Company's acquisitions, and notwithstanding the multiplied temptations, a very great majority of those who arrive at the higher stations wholly escape their influence, and are distinguished for the most unsullied integrity of character. Whenever a deviation has occurred, it could invariably be traced to the imprudence of the young man on his first arrival, and his subsequent dependence on his Dewan.\n\nThe British merchants of Calcutta are a numerous and respectable body of men, many of whom have acquired large fortunes by their industry and enterprising spirit, and conduce essentially to the prosperity of the province. They here display a liberality in their manner of living seldom equalled in any other part of the world, and their acts of charity and munificence to persons in distress have never been surpassed by any similar number of men of any rank whatever.\n\nThe Armenians are a respectable and, probably, the most numerous body of foreign merchants at the presidency. They carry on an extensive trade to China and the eastward, and to the west as far as the Arabian Gulf, or Red Sea. Some of the most respectable are commonly invited to the public balls and entertainments. The number of Greek merchants in Calcutta is not considerable. They maintain one clergyman, who performs religious worship according to their rites. The Portuguese houses of agency are, in point of number, next to those of the English. A very considerable number of the progeny of that nation reside in Calcutta and the environs, and have approximated very closely to the natives in colour and manners.\n\nAmong the various classes of the mercantile community no mention is made of Jews. Few of that nation have settled in Hindostan, and Calcutta is probably the only very opulent town that is wholly free from them. Their practices and occupations are engrossed by the native banyans, sirears, and writers, most of whom are quite a match for any Jew. The shops of these petty traffickers, although better than their houses, are mean and disagreeable. The European shops are singularly splendid.\n\nThe maintenance and education of children belonging to Europeans in India, have, on account of their number, become objects of great importance. Two institutions of this sort have been formed, one for the education of officers' children, and the other for those of private soldiers. To these charitable foundations may be added a free-school and native hospital.\n\nWithout being attached to some department of the service, or educated to some mechanical trade or profession, there is hardly any hope of prosperity to a young man coming out on chance from Europe. Here all the inferior situations of clerks, overseers, &c. are necessarily\noccupied by natives, and it is by those gradations that in Europe young men rise to opulence in the commercial world. It is scarcely in the power, even of a governor-general, to assist a person of respectable connexions, who is not in one of the services or liberal professions. Although the climate is not essentially improved, Europeans are now much better acquainted with the means of counteracting its effects than formerly, and deaths are far from being so frequent. Regularity of living, avoiding too much exposure to the sun, and all extremes, (even of abstinence), are much more practised by the present inhabitants than they were by the first adventurers. Vacancies, consequently, in any line or trade are of much rarer occurrence.\n\nThe supreme court of justice at Calcutta consists of a chief-justice and two puisne judges, nominated to their situations in India by the king. Its cognizance extends to all British subjects; that is, natives, or the descendants of natives of Great Britain, in India, and to all the inhabitants of Calcutta; but this court is allowed no cognizance over the land revenue. In suits, to which the natives are parties, the judges are enjoined, by act of parliament, to respect the usages of the country. In matters of inheritance, or contract, the rule of decision is to be the law acknowledged by the litigant parties. Should only one of the parties be a Mahommedan or Hindoo, it is to be the law acknowledged by the defendant. Criminal offences are tried by a jury, consisting, exclusively, of British subjects; in trials of a civil nature the judges decide both on the law and on the fact. The supreme court also tries criminal charges against the Company's servants, and civil suits in which the Company or the Company's servants are concerned. The law practitioners, attached to the supreme court, are 14 attorneys and six barristers.\n\nLittle morality is learned in a court of justice; and, notwithstanding the severity of the police and of the English laws, it appears probable that the morals of the native inhabitants are worse in Calcutta than in the provincial districts. This is not to be attributed solely to the size, population, and indiscriminate society of the capital, but in part to the supreme court, every native connected with which appearing to have his morals and manners contaminated by the connexion. In mentioning this evil, it is not intended, in the most remote degree, to attribute it to any individual or body of men, or to speak with disrespect of the institution itself; but merely to mention a fact, which has probably been remarked by every judge that ever sat on that bench. Within these few years the natives have attained a sort of legal knowledge, as it is usually denominated. This consists of a skill in the arts of collusion, intrigue, perjury, and subornation, which enables them to perplex and baffle the magistrates with infinite facility.\n\nNotwithstanding the temptations to which the natives are exposed, it is surprising how seldom thefts or burglaries are committed on the property of Europeans in Bengal, who scarcely take any precaution against them. In some families 30 and 40 domestics sleep during the night within the enclosure, or in the passages and verandahs of the house, where every door is open, and detection almost impossible. From their extreme timidity, they seldom venture to rob openly, or on a large scale, but prefer a more circuitous and complicated mode of small pilfering and cheating.\n\nThe court of appeal and circuit for the Calcutta division comprehends the following districts, viz. 1. Burdwan; 2. Jungle Mahals; 3. Midnapoor; 4. Cuttack; 5. Jessore; 6. Nuddea; 7. Hooghly; 8. The foreign settlements of Chandernagore, Chinsura, and Serampore; 9.

The decrease fell chiefly on corals, coffee, spices, and galls.\n\nThe exports to the two Gulfs show a neat increase of 988,371 rupees.

Long. 73\u00b0. 12'. E. This place sustained numerous sieges, during the wars of the Mahommedans and Maharattas; and is surrounded with ruins of different sorts. It is still a populous town, and carries on some traffic in cocoa-nuts, oil, coarse cloths, brass, and earthen-ware. Its appearance indicates a former state of superior grandeur; but it is now a poor Mahommedan town. The travelling distance from Poonah is 91 miles. (M. Graham, Rennel, &c.)*\n\n**Calicut, (Calicodu).\u2014A district in the province of Malabar, extending along the sea coast between the parallels of 10\u00b0. and 12\u00b0. north latitude; and one of the principal countries of that extraordinary Hindoo sect the Nairs, the Calicut Rajah or Zamorin of the Europeans being one of their chiefs. By his own caste, and the other natives, he is called the Tamuri Rajah.**\n\nAll the males of the family of the Tamuri Rajah or Zamorin, are called Tamburans, and all the females are called Tamburetties. All the children of every Tamburetti are entitled to these appellations; and, according to seniority, rise to the highest dignities that belong to the family. These ladies are generally impregnated by Namburis, (Brahmins of high caste), and sometimes by the higher rank of Nairs; but the sacred character of the Namburis always procures them a preference. The ladies live in the houses of their brothers, and never have any intercourse with their husbands, which would be reckoned scandalous.\n\nThe oldest man of the family by the female line is the Tamuri Rajah, or Zamorin, who is also named Mana Vierama Sanudri Rajah, and is regularly crowned. This chief pretends to be of a higher rank than the Brahmins, and to be only inferior to the invisible gods, which pretensions are acknowledged by his lay subjects; but held absurd and abominable by the Brahmins, who treat him as a Sudra. The Zamorin, although of a caste inferior to the Cochin Rajah, and possessed of less extensive dominions, was commonly reckoned of equal rank, which is attributed to the superior prowess of his people. In 1766, when Hyder invaded Malabar, the Cochin Rajah quietly submitted to pay tribute; while the pride of the Zamorin refused any kind of submission; and, after an unavailing resistance, being made prisoner, set fire to the house in which he was confined, and was burned with it. Several of his personal attendants, who were accidentally excluded when he shut the door, afterwards threw themselves into the flames, and perished with their master.\nIt appears from the records of Tillichery, that the English first began to traffic in the Zamorin's dominions in the year 1664. Hyder invaded the country, in person, in the year 1766; but, was soon afterwards called away, by a war in the dominions of the Nabob of Arcot. The Tamuri Rajahs embraced this opportunity, and having re-possessed themselves, held their lands for seven years. A Brahmin named Chinavas Row, was then sent against them, and drove them into the dominions of Travancore. After nine years of his administration, the British came and took Palighat; but, in the approach of Tippoo, were obliged to retreat by Paniani. The Rajahs continued in exile until 1790, when a little before the battle of Tiruvana Angady, they joined Colonel Hartley with 5000 Nairs. At the peace with Tippoo, in 1792, this district, consisting of 63 talock, and the revenue estimated at eight and a half lacs of pagodas, was ceded in perpetuity to the Company.\n\nFormerly the chiefs of Punatoor, Talapuli, Mannacollatil, Tirmanachery, Agenicutil, and many others, were tributary to the Zamorin, and furnished on emergencies quotas of troops. He has now no authority whatever, and is subsisted by the bounty of the British government. Further particulars respecting this district will be found under the article Malabar. (F. Buchanan, Wilkes, Duncan, &c.)\n\nCALICUT.\u2014A town on the sea coast of the Malabar province, the capital of the district of Calicut. Lat. 11\u00b0. 18'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 56'. E.\n\nThe Portuguese under Vaseo de Gama, arrived at Calicut on the 18th May, 1498, 10 months and two days after their departure from Lisbon. In 1509, Don Fernando Coutinho, Marcechal of Portugal, with 3000 troops attacked Calicut; but was slain in the attack, and his army repulsed with great loss. In 1766 it was invaded and conquered by Hyder, who enlarged and improved the fort; but Tippoo afterwards destroyed both town and fort, and removed the inhabitants to Nelluru, the name of which he changed to Furruckabad being like all the Mahomedans of India, a great changer of the old Pagan names. Fifteen months after this forced emigration, the English conquered the province, and the inhabitants returned with great joy to their old habitation. The town in 1800 contained above 5000 houses, and was rapidly improving. The inhabitants were chiefly Moplays. The principal exports are pepper, teak, sandal wood, cardamoms, coir cordage, and wax.

E.\n\nCALLAO.\u2014This island lies opposite to the coast of Cochin China, and about eight miles to the eastward of a considerable river, on the banks of which is situated the town of Faifoo, a place of some note, not far from the harbour of Turon. The extreme points of the island lie in Lat. 15\u00b0. 53'. N. and 15\u00b0. 57'. N. The greatest length is about five\nmiles, and the average breadth two miles.\n\nThe only inhabited part is the S.W. coast. One of the mountains to the south is about 1500 feet high; the low ground contains about 200 acres. This beautiful spot is diversified with neat houses, temples, clusters of trees, small hillocks covered with shrubbery, and trees of various kinds. A rill of water is carried along the upper ridges of the vale, to water the rice grounds. The number of the houses on the island are about 60. This would be a most advantageous spot to establish a settlement. A very few men would serve for a garrison, a great part of the coast being already fortified by nature. The depth of water in the bay and road is sufficient for ships of any burthen, and there is shelter from every wind except the south-west; on this quarter, however, the distance of the continent is so inconsiderable, that it would break the force of the sea.

It is bounded on the north by the River Jumna, and on the west by Bundelcund, its southern limits are uncertain. The Cane and Jumna are the principal rivers, and the chief towns Callinger, Senrab, and Attouah. In 1582 it is described by Abul Fazel as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Callinger, containing 11 mahals, measurement 508,273 bee-\n\ngahs, revenue 23,839,474 dams. Seyurghal 614,580 dams. The sircar furnishes 1210 cavalry, 12 elephants, and 18,000 infantry.\"\n\nThis district was ceded to the British in December, 1803, by the Maharatta Peshwa, in exchange for other districts nearer to his own capital. The Maharattas early renounced this territory nominally tributary, but derived no benefit from it; being in reality unable to enforce their authority, from the refractory disposition of the inhabitants, and the number of natural strong holds they possessed.\n\nCallinger.\u2014A town and strong fortress in the province of Allahabad, the capital of a district of the same name. Lat. 24\u00b0. 58'. N. Long. 86\u00b0. 25'. N. Abul Fazel in 1582 describes it as follows:\u2014Callinger is a stone fort, situated on a lofty mountain. Here is an idol named Kalbilhroop, 18 cubits in height. At the distance of 20 coss from the fort husbandmen sometimes find small diamonds, and in the neighbourhood is an iron mine.\"\n\nRajahs of Callinger are mentioned so early by Mahomedan historians as A.D. 1008; but, it was not conquered until 1203, and then not permanently retained. In 1545, it was stormed by the troops of Shere Khan, who lost his life during the assault, by the explosion of some ammunition.\n\nThis fortress resembles in its situation, and exceeds in its size and natural strength the fortress of Gwalior, being built on a high rock of great extent, which forms one of the ranges of mountains extending from Rhotas or Sasseram, to the confines of Ajmeer. To garrison it efficiently would require 5000 men. After the invasion of Bundelcund by Ali Bahauder and Rajah Himnut Bahauder, the siege of this place was attempted; but, at an early period, for want of a battering train was converted into a blockade, which lasted for many years, but without ultimate success. The power and\ninfluence of the Kelladar of Callinger were the chief obstacles to the success of Ali Bahader, during the last five years of his life, and compelled him to encamp a considerable part of his army in the vicinity of that fortress.\n\nThe same opposition with increased energy was continued after the cession of the country to the British, and Callinger became an asylum for all the disaffected and banditti in the province. After many ineffectual attempts to obtain possession by an amicable arrangement with the Killadar or governor, it was in 1810 besieged in form by the British, who were repulsed with great slaughter, in an attempt to carry this nearly impregnable fortress by storm. The garrison, however, although successful, were so intimidated by the determination displayed by the assailants, that they evacuated it during the night.

It is bounded on the north by the Kangrah districts; to the eastward by a large tract of country named Besseer; to the southward by Nhan; and to the west by Punjab. In 1783 it was subject to the Ranee of Bellaspoor, and the revenue was estimated at 12 lacks of rupees. The Sutuleje is the only river of consequence, and Bellaspoor the principal town.

The river at Caltura is one of the largest branches of the Muliwaddy, and is here about a mile broad. It washes two sides of the fort by which it is commanded, and is navigable by boats to the sea. Some tracts of cinnamon are scattered up and down in the vicinity; but a short way further south we come to the termination of the fertile district of Columbo, which contains so great a proportion of the wealth of Ceylon. A quantity of arrack is made from the produce of the cocoa-nut trees, and there is a large plantation of sugar canes, and a distillery of rum carried on by some Dutchmen, which is much inferior in quality to the West India rum.

Long. 72\u00b0. 45'. E.\n\nNear the town the tides of the gulf run with great rapidity, and rise and fall 40 feet, so that at high water ships can anchor near the town, but at low water the river runs almost dry, so that the vessels in the river must lie aground in the mud. When Ahmedabad, in Gujrat, flourished the capital of an independent state, Cambay was its sea-port, and experienced great prosperity, but it decayed with its metropolis, and is now much reduced. Elephants' teeth and cornelians are procured here for the China market, but the chief article of export is cotton to\nBombay, and grain; the imports are the same as in the province of Gujrat generally.\n\nMajor Wilford is of opinion, that in the 5th century Tamra-nagara, or Cambat, (Cambay) was the capital of the Balarayas, and perhaps of the Hindoo emperors of the west, when the two dignities happened to be united in the same person. Osorio, a Portuguese writer, says, that when Francis d'Almeida landed near Cambay, in the year 1515, he saw the ruins of sumptuous buildings and temples, the remains of an ancient city. It is said such ruins exist to the present day to the south of Cambay, on the Broach side, where there are temples and other buildings half buried in the sand, with which this place was overwhelmed. Cambay was taken and pillaged by the Mahommedans in A.D. 1297, during the reign of Alla ud Deen.\n\nAt this town, and others in Gujrat, are Hindoo subterranean temples, which have been constructed since the Mahommedan invasion, and still remain. In the houses of opulent persons are also frequently found apartments under ground, where they conceal their females and property during times of alarm. In a Jain subterranean temple, at Cambay, are two massy statues of their deities, one of which is white, and the other black. The inscription on the first intimates that it is an image of Parswanatha, a Jain deity, carved and consecrated in the reign of the Emperor Acber, A.D. 1602. The black one has merely the date inscribed, 1651, with the names of the two Banyans who brought it there.\n\nThe natives of Cambay are reckoned the most expert plasterers in the Gujrat province. In the north-west quarter of India, it is supposed that the saline particles in the water, even where remote from the ocean, give that appearance of dampness and coarseness to the walls for which they are remarkable, when compared with those of Coromandel. This town is now comprehended in the British territories under the Bombay presidency.\n\nTravelling distance from Bombay, 281, from Delhi, 663, from Calcutta, 1253 miles. (Drummond, Wilford, Malet, Maurice, Elmore, Renneel, &c.)\n\nCambay, Gulf of.\u2014A gulf on the north-west coast of India, which penetrates about 150 miles into the province of Gujrat.\n\nThe tides in this gulf run with amazing velocity, and at low water, during spring tides, leave the bottom of the bay dry from lat. 22\u00b0 3' N. to Cambay town. No vessels attempt to go above Gongway in one tide from Jumbosier, it being often attended with bad consequences; for if they cannot get into Cambay Creek, they must return to Gongway, which is distant five leagues. In many places the current is so rapid, that if a ship takes the ground she immediately upsets, and, in all probability, every person on board perish. It is supposed that the depth of water in the Gulf of Cambay has progressively decreased for more than two centuries past.\n\nFifteen miles east of Cambay city, the bed of the gulf is reduced to six miles broad, and is dry at ebb tide; but the passage ought never to be attempted, either on horse or foot, without a native guide, as there is a danger of wandering among the mud and quicksands, and being overtaken by the flood tide, which rushes furiously in, like the bore in the Calcutta River. (Elmore, Drummond, &c.)\n\nCambodia, (Cambuja).\u2014A country in India beyond the Ganges, situated principally betwixt the 10th and 15th degrees of north latitude, and extending along the east side of the Bay of Siam. To the north it is bounded by Laos, to the south by sea; to the east it is separated from Cochin China by a ridge of mountains, and to the west it has Siam and part of the Birman empire. In length it may be estimated at 350 miles, by 150 the average breadth.\nRespecting this country we have very little recent information, and the old is either obsolete, or not to be depended upon. It is likewise named Camboja, Cambu-chat, and by the Birmaus Yoodra-shan, and extends to the southernmost point of India beyond the Ganges, (Malacca excepted) where the whole coast from Cambodia point, to the western point of the great Cambodia River, is covered with underwood, and exceedingly low. In this part the sea is so shallow, that at the distance of five or six miles from the shore the water is seldom more than four fathoms deep, and nothing larger than a boat can approach within two miles. This southern extremity of Asia sinks into the sea by very slow gradations.\n\nThe vegetable productions of this province are the same as of the neighbouring countries, Ava and Siam; the colouring matter, named gamboge, derives its name from this kingdom, being the concrete resinous juice of certain trees found here of superior quality, but produced likewise in other parts of India. Very little external commerce has at any time subsisted with the European settlements of India, but the country is extremely well adapted for an inland navigation, as the rivers of Cambodia and Siam communicate in the interior by a considerable branch named the Annan. The Chinese and Macao Portuguese still carry on a small traffic, importing silk goods, China and lacquered ware, tea, sweetmeats, tin, and tutenagne; and exporting a variety of dried fish and woods, such as sapan wood, rose wood, black wood, &c., drugs, mother-of-pearl, shells, and skins of different sorts. The chief port of export is Saigong in Siampa. The Maykaung (properly Mekon) or Cambodia or Don-nai River, rises in Tibet, and is navigable for boats during a considerable part of its course, part of which is through the province of Yuman in China. For ships it is navigable 40 miles from its junction with the sea, where the city of Saigong is situated. It has several branches, but the width of the principal branch is about two miles broad, and the water very deep. The chief town is Lowaick, but, like the river, is also named Cambodia by Europeans, but there are only three other collections of houses that deserve the name of towns. Lower Cambodia being incorporated with Cochin China, entirely resembles it.\n\nThe Khomen language is used by a nation of that name, who reside on the banks of the Me-kon, or River of Cambu Chat, or Cambodia. The Khomen are reckoned an ancient and learned people, and were formerly subdued by the Thay J'hay, or ancient Siamese race. The modern Thay, or Siamese, still denominate the Bali character, Nangsu Khom, or the Khomen letter from this nation. They are not, however, supposed to have existed as a polished people so early as the Law (Laos), but are believed to have derived their origin from the warlike race of mountaineers named Kho, the Gucoos of the Portuguese historians; who are still represented as practising their ancient customs, of eating human flesh, and tattooing their bodies. The name of Camboja is often mentioned in the Ramayon, and other ancient Hindoo poems, where its horses are celebrated; but the designation, probably, refers to Cambay in Gujrat, as we can scarcely suppose that, in the remote times of Hindoo antiquity, an intercourse subsisted betwixt Oude, the capital of the great Ram, and this remote country.\n\nWith the present state of the interior we are wholly unacquainted, and its religion can only be guessed at. Surrounded on all sides by nations professing to follow the doctrines of Buddha, the majority of the inhabitants of Cambodia are, probably, sectaries of the same religion. The accounts we have of the mountaineers assimilate them to the baronous aborigines found all over In-\ndia, where neither the Hindoo nor the Mahommedan religion has penetrated, or made any lasting impression. (Leyden, Stanuton, F. Buchanan, Symes, De Bissacher, &c.)\n\nCambodia.\u2014A city in India beyond the Ganges, the capital of the kingdom of Cambodia. Lat. 13\u00b0. Long. 104\u00b0. 35'. E. By the Birman it is named Lowaick, and is situated on the River Mekon, or Cambodia, about 150 miles from the sea.\n\nCambing.\u2014A small island, about 30 miles in circumference, lying off the north coast of Timor, betwixt the 8th and 9th degrees of south latitude.\n\nCambyna.\u2014An island in the Eastern Seas, about 60 miles in circumference, lying off the south-eastern extremity of Celebes. It is very mountainous, and one hill in particular is of a very great elevation.\n\nCamigten.\u2014A small island, one of the Philippines, about 10 miles in length, by four the average breadth, situated due north of the island of Luzon. There is a considerable trade carried on here for wax, gold, cocoanuts, and cassia.\n\nCamroop, (Camarupa, the aspect of desire).\u2014A province in Assam, which formerly gave its name to an extensive kingdom, of which Rangamatty seems to have been the capital. It extends from the Candar Chokeyin Ootrecole, along the banks of the Brahmapootra to the province of Dehrung. Goalparah and the Candar Chokey to the west, are the natural boundaries of Assam, for they are in reality the natural boundaries of a new climate.\n\nThis province is intersected in various directions by rivers flowing from the mountains, and by branches of the Brahmapootra, which are navigable during the inundation for boats of any size. The breadth of this province, from the banks of the Brahmapootra to the mountains is, on an average, 40 miles; its length, from Candar Chokey, to the Burranuddee, is about 100 miles. A military causeway extends from Cooch Bahar to the north of this and other districts, to the utmost limits of Assam. In most places it is now in a state of decay.\n\nThis province was invaded by Mahommed Bukhtyar Khilijce in 1204, immediately after the conquest of Bengal by the Mahommedans; but he was compelled to retreat after losing nearly the whole of his army. It is probable the dominions of Camroop, at this period, extended much further to the westward than the modern territory, and included many districts since annexed to Bengal, such as Rangamatty, Rungpoor, and Cooch Bahar. The mode of defence adopted by the princes of these countries when invaded, was to retire with their families and effects into the jungles, until the violence of the rains, the inundation of the country, and the pestilential effects of an unhealthy climate, compelled the enemies to capitulate, or to attempt a destructive retreat. (Wade, Stewart, &c.)\n\nCananore, (Canura).\u2014A town on the sea coast of the province of Malabar. Lat. 11\u00b0. 52'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 27'. E.\n\nThe country about this place consists of low hills and narrow vallies; the hills inland are covered with bushes, and beautifully skirted with plantations. The rice grounds are extensive, well drained, and carefully supplied with water.\n\nCananore was purchased from the Dutch by the ancestors of the Biby, (female sovereign) who is a Moplay, or Mahommedan. Prior to this the family were of little consequence, and entirely dependent on the Cherical rajahs; but having acquired a fortress, considered by the Nairs as impregnable, they became powerful, and were looked up to as the head of all the Mahommedans of Malabar. The succession goes in the female line as usual in Malabar. The children of the Biby's son will have no claim to the sovereignty, but will be succeeded by the son of his niece, who is the daughter of his sister.\nThe territory of this princess on the continent is very small; yet she pays a revenue of 14,000 rupees as land-tax, and the East India Company receive all the customs. The Biby is allowed to collect all the revenue, but her profit from thence must be inconsiderable. Most of the Laccadives are subject to her; but they are wretched islands, producing no grain, nor any thing but cocoa-nuts, betel nut, and plaintains. The Biby of Cananore possesses several vessels that sail to Arabia, and carries on a considerable trade to Bengal, Arabia, and Sumatra.\n\nThis town is situated at the bottom of a small bay, which is one of the best on the coast, and contains several good houses belonging to Mahommedan merchants. The people here have no communication with the Maldives, although the sultan and inhabitants of these islands are Mopays also. Cananore is defended by a fortress, situated on the point which forms the bay; and it has been strengthened with works after the European fashion, since the province was ceded to the Company; and it is now the head-quarters of the government.\n\nThe small district of Cananore extends nowhere more than two miles from the glacis of the fort. The surface is high and uneven, but not so much as to prevent the whole from being cultivated once in three, six, or nine years, according to the quality of the soil. In 1800, the number of houses in Cananore and the district of Cherical was 10,386, and of slaves there were 4670. In Cherical and Cotiote there are slaves, chiefly of the Poliar and Pariar castes; but the greater part of the cultivation is carried on by panicar, or hired men. A trade is carried from hence with Arabia, Bengal, Sumatra, and Surat; from whence horses, almonds, piece goods, sugar, opium, silk, benzoin, and camphire are imported; the exports are, principally, pepper and cardamums, sandal wood, coir, and sharks' fins. So early as 1505, the Portuguese had a fort at Cananore. (F. Buchanan, Bruce, &c.)\n\nCANARA, (Carnata).\n\nA province on the west coast of India, extending from the 12th to the 15th degree of north latitude. To the north it has the Maharatta territories, in the province of Bejapoor; to the south the Malabar districts; on the east it has Mysore, and the Balaghat territories; and to the west the sea. In length it may be estimated at 200 miles, by 35 miles the average breadth. The province was transferred to the Company in 1799, and now forms one of the collectorships under the Madras presidency; but, in geographical description, is usually divided into north and south Canara, under which heads further topographical details will be found.\n\nThe tract distinguished in our maps as the province of Canara, by a fatality unexampled in the history of nations, neither is, nor ever was known by that name to the people of the country, or of any part of India. Voyagers and Mahommedan strangers, finding that it was a dependency of the kingdom of Canara, and probably that the officers of government spoke that language, gave the name of Canara to the district called by the natives Tulava, which name, however, applies more particularly to the country north of the River Chandragiri. Canara is a corruption of Karnata, the table land above the Ghauts; the British province of which is composed of the maritime countries of Tulava, Haiga, and the adjacent parts of Malabar and the Hindoo kaukana.\n\nThe province of Canara continued undisturbed, under a Hindoo government, until 1763, when it was subdued to Hyder. On his taking possession, it was a highly improved country, filled with industrious inhabitants, who enjoyed greater ad-\nvantages than their neighbours above the Ghauts; the small estates into which it was subdivided were considered the actual property of the holders, and the assessment fixed and moderate. Prior to the acquisition of this province by the Company, the population was much reduced in consequence of wars and internal feuds, the destruction of many principal towns by Tippoo Sultan, and to his sending above 60,000 Christian inhabitants captives into Mysore, from whence but a small number ever returned. The country was consequently found in a state of desolation, and contained large tracts of unclaimed waste, overgrown with woods, particularly in the vicinity of the Ghauts.\n\nFrom the first transfer of Canara to the British authority, it has continued a solitary example of tranquillity; of an easy and regular realization of the revenue and of general property. This has been attributed to the nature of the tenures by which landed property is held in this province, to the moderate revenue exacted, and to its local situation, which is advantageous for the disposal of its produce.\n\nThe rent at present received by proprietors from fixed tenants and tenants at will, is estimated to be generally about one-half of the gross produce, the government tax being about 60 per cent. of the landlord's rent, and 30 per cent. of the gross produce. Since the cession a great improvement has been exhibited among the people in dress, mode of living, and other personal comforts; and the aggregate revenue has increased, and is realized with singular punctuality, notwithstanding the numberless estates from which it is collected. This last circumstance arises from the natural division and subdivision of property under the Hindoo laws, and amounted, in one district of the province only, to above 22,000, some of which yielded only one fanam of rent. All the land here is private property, derived from gift or purchase, or descent from antiquity too remote to be traced.\n\nIn a country so rocky and uneven as Canara, where cattle are not only scarce, but can rarely be employed; where every spot, before it can be cultivated, must be levelled with great labour by the hand of man; the expense of the first preparation of waste land must have been so great, that it never would have been attempted unless the revenue assessment had been very moderate. Even after the land is brought into cultivation, if it be neglected for a few years, it is soon broken up by deep gullies, formed by the torrents which fall during the monsoon. In this province, and also in that of Malabar, the proprietor of land bestows on his little spot all that minute labour and attention, which is so important to Indian husbandry. Each man lives on his estate; and the neatness of the culture and of the enclosures show the attention with which the proprietor improves and embellishes his ground.\n\nCanara will probably never be a manufacturing country, because it produces none of the raw materials necessary to render it such; and because the heavy rains, which last so great a part of the year, are insurmountable obstacles to all operations which require to be carried on in the open air under a clear sky; but the same rains that deny it manufactures, give it a succession of never-failing crops of rice, which is exported to Malabar, Goa, Bombay, and Arabia.\n\nThe principal places recorded as trading ports in this province are Mangalore, Ankala, Omore, Cundapoor, Barkoor, and Beccul. Mangalore is the emporium from whence and from others, in a small degree, are exported to Arabia cardamoms, coir, pepper, moories, poon spars, rice, sandal wood, oil, betel nut, ghee, and iron; to Goa, large supplies of rice, horn, grain, and tobacco; to the Maharatta coun-\ntrics, iron, rice, betel nut, natcherry, &c.\n\nFrom Arabia are imported dates, brimstone, salt fish, and horses; from Bombay, brimstone, sugar, and horses; from the Maharatta country, horses, shawls, blue cloths, &c.\n\nThe total value of imports from places beyond the territories of the Madras government, between the 1st May, 1811, and the 30th April, 1812, was, Arcot rupees 470,082, viz.\n\n| From Arabia | - - - - - - | 57,248 |\n| Calcutta    | - - - - - - | 22,293 |\n| Bombay      | - - - - - - | 97,472 |\n| China       | - - - - - - | 3,562 |\n| Maharatta country | - - - - - - | 214,853 |\n| Various places | - - - - - - | 44,474 |\n\nArcot rupees 470,082\n\nThe total value of the exports during the above period, to places beyond the limits of the Madras government, was, Arcot rupees 2,284,876, viz.\n\n| To Arabia | - - - - - - | 336,943 |\n| Calcutta  | - - - - - - | 2,867 |\n| Bombay    | - - - - - - | 854,956 |\n| Ceylon    | - - - - - - | 16,516 |\n| Gujrat    | - - - - - - | 861,069 |\n| Maharatta country | - - - - - - | 152,970 |\n| Various places | - - - - - - | 59,555 |\n\nArcot rupees 2,284,876\n\nFrom the 1st May, 1811, to the 30th April, 1812, 943 vessels and craft, measuring 36,951 tons, arrived in the province; and 882, measuring 24,576 tons, departed. (Wilks, Munro, F. Buchanan, Reports, Hodson, Thackeray, Lord William Bentinck, &c.)\n\nCanara (North).\u2014The northern division of the province of Canara, situated betwixt the 13th and 15th degrees of north latitude, and containing three smaller districts\u2014Kundapura, Onore, and Ancola. On leaving Devakara, in North Canara, the Karnata country begins, which extends below the Ghauts, and occupies all the defiles leading up to the mountains. The part of the Hindoo Kankana (Concan) included in this division, forming the district of Aucola, is larger than either of the districts into which Haiga is divided. All the country from Onore inclusive as far as Gaukarna, is called Haiga, and is said formerly to have been under the influence of Ravana, King of Lanka or Ceylon. In 1800 it paid only 29,000 pagodas, while Onore produced 51,000, and Kundapura 50,000, which arose from Ancola's having long been in an unsettled state, and much ravaged by the Maharattas.\n\nNorth Canara produces sandalwood trees, sugar canes, teak, wild cinnamon, nutmegs and pepper, and cut or terra japonica. In the southern part the quantity of rice grown is small, and a great part of the country is covered with low woods, in which are to be seen the inclosures of former gardens. The water in the wells is nowhere at any great distance from the surface. To the north of Battecolla much of the soil is poor; in many places the laterite being entirely naked. About Beluru are many groves of the calophyllum inophyllum, from the seed of which the common lamp oil of the country is expressed, and in this neighbourhood a good cocoa nut tree is reckoned to produce 50 nuts annually. In 1800, the number of teak trees cut down annually amounted to about 3000. The mimosa catechu grows spontaneously on all the hills in South Concar, from which the terra japonica, or cut, is made. The only cattle in the part of the district named Haiga are buffaloes and oxen, an equal number of which are yoked in the plough. In Haiga carts are not used.\n\nThe sea coast is principally occupied by villages of Brahmins, the interior parts belong to the Buntar caste. About Ancola it is not the custom for the inhabitants to live in towns. A few shops are collected in one place, and all the other natives of what is called a village, are\nscattered upon their farms. Most of the people about Ancola are of Karnata extraction, and but few of Concan descent remain, except a particular kind of Brahmins, who are all merchants, as those of Haiga are cultivators. Being originally descended of the Panish Gauda, or Brahmins of the North of India, those of Concan are held in great contempt by the Dravida Brahmins, or division of the south, one of the strongest reasons assigned for which is, that they eat fish.\n\nIn the country about Battecola there are none of the Buntar caste, nor does the language of Tulava extend so far to the north. Battecola is properly in the Haiga country, and the most common farmers are a kind of Brahmins, named Haiga, after the country, and a low caste of Hindoos named Halepecas.\n\nThe Comarapeka in this district are a tribe of Concan descent, and seem to be sudras of pure birth, who properly belong to the country, in the same manner as the Nairs are the pure sudras of Malabar. By birth they are all cultivators and soldiers, and, as usual with this class of men among the Hindoos, strongly inclined to robbery. From the anarchy which had long prevailed in this part of Canara, they had acquired an extraordinary degree of cruelty, and had even compelled many Brahmins to assume their customs, and adopt their caste.\n\nThe principal towns in the district of North Canara are Battecola, Ancola, Carwar, Mirjaow, and Onore: on account of the short distance between the Western Ghauts and the sea, there are no rivers of great magnitude, but many mountain streams. In this district, in 1800, there were 385 houses occupied by Christians; 1500 by Mahomedans; 4834 by Brahmins; 147 by Sive Bhactars; and 87 Jains.\n\nA Brahmin of this district, who had written an account of the capture of Seringapatam by General Harris, although he knew it happened on a Saturday, yet, because Saturday is an unlucky day, altered it to Monday, as it now stands in his history. Such discordancies, therefore, in Hindoo Chronology must not be considered by the antiquary as any proof of either ignorance or error. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nCanara (South).\u2014The southern division of the province of Canara, situated principally betwixt the 12th and 14th degrees of north latitude. The country to the north of the River Chandragiri, where Malabar ends, is called Tulava by the Hindoos, and South Canara by the British.\n\nThe soil of Tulava gradually grows worse for grain, as it is distant from the sea. The best in quality extends from Mangalore to Buntwala, the next from thence to Punjalcotta, and the worst from thence to the hills. About Cavila, east of Mangalore, some of the hills are covered with tall, thick forests, in which the teak tree is found. The strata of Tulava, near the sea coast, resemble entirely those of Malabar, and consist of laterite, or brickstone, with a very few rocks of granite interspersed. Poor land of every description requires more seed than richer land of the same kind. A garden of 300 acres requires the labour of six people if it be watered from a well, but of only three if it be watered from a tank. Cultivators who are rich keep from 20 to 25 ploughs, but at least one half of the actual farmers have only one. From Urigara to Hossodarga, the country near the sea is low and sandy, and too poor to produce even cocoa nuts.\n\nThe exports by land consist chiefly of salt, salt fish, betel nut, ginger, cocoa nuts, cocoa nut oil, and raw silk. The imports by land are chiefly cloths, cotton, thread, blankets, tobacco, and black cattle, with a small quantity of pepper and sandal wood.\n\nIn 1800, this division of the Canara province contained 206,633 males, and 190,039 females. This excess of the males over the female\npopulation, has also been found to prevail in the Barramahal and other parts of the south of India. The number of houses was about 80,000, of which there were 2545 inhabited by Christians; 5223 by Mahomedans; 7187 by Brahmins; 2700 by Jains; and the remainder by different low castes of Hindoos. The number of slaves of both sexes was 7924. Swine are kept by some of the low castes, but the pork of tame swine is an abomination with the Bunts, as with all the higher ranks of Hindoos, although many of them relish the flesh of the wild hog. No horses, sheep, goats, or asses, are bred in Tulava, nor have its inhabitants any carts.\n\nTo judge from appearances, the occupiers of land in this district are richer than those of Malabar, who are probably in easier circumstances than those of Coimbetoor, or those above the Ghauts. The universality of poverty in India, and the care with which every thing is concealed, render it very difficult to ascertain the real circumstances of the cultivator. A good slave sells for about 10 pagodas, or four guineas; free men of low caste, if they be in debt or trouble, sometimes sell their sisters' children, who are their heirs. They have no authority over their own children, who belong to their maternal uncles. The Brahmins of Tulava, like the Namburis (Brahmins) of Malabar, pretend, that the country was created expressly for their use by Parasu Rama, and that they are the only persons entitled to be called proprietors of the soil. In the northern parts of South-Canara there are two castes, called Bacadaru and Batadaru, both of whom are slaves, and have exactly the same customs; yet each disputes for pre-eminence, and will not eat or intermarry together.\n\nAlong the sea coast, from Caya\u00ef to Urigara, the inhabitants are principally Moplays (Mahommedans), who now possess the sea coast, as the Nairs do the interior. Although the Nairs are more numerous than the Moplays, yet, during Tippoo's reign, when not protected by government, the Hindoos were obliged to skulk in the woods, and all such as could be caught were circumcised.\n\nThis mode of conversion, however involuntary, is perfectly effectual, and the convert immediately becomes a good Mahommedan, as otherwise he would have no caste at all; and although the doctrine of caste be no part of the faith of Mahommed, it has yet been fully adopted by the lower rank of Mahommedans in India.\n\nThe chief towns in this district are Barcelore, Mangalore, and Calianpoor; there are no rivers of magnitude or consequence, but many mountain streams. The language of Tulava, or South Canara, has a strong resemblance to that of Malabar, and the written characters are the same; but in the language of Tulava, there is a great admixture of words from all the countries, containing the five southern nations of India, viz., Telinga, Maharashtra, Karnataca, Gujura, and Dravida. In Tulava the era of Salivahanam is in use, by which the year A.D. 1800 corresponds with 1722; but to the north it is reckoned the year 1723. The year is solar. The people of this division, although longer subjected to a foreign yoke than those of Malabar, never were so entirely subdued as the greater part of the Hindoos, and have always been able successfully to resist the pretensions of their governors, to be proprietors of the soil.\n\nThe former sovereigns of this country, princes of the house of Ikeri, had always given great encouragement to the Christians, and had induced 80,000 of them to settle in Tulava. They were all of Concan descent, and retained the language, dress, and manners of the people of that country. The clergy adopted the dress of the order to which they belonged, but they are all natives, descended from Concan.\nfamilies, and were purposely educated in a seminary at Goa, where they were instructed in the Portuguese and Latin languages, and in the doctrines of the Church of Rome. In Tulava they had 27 churches, each provided with a vicar, and the whole under the control of a vicar-general, subject to the Archbishop of Goa. Tippoo threw the priests into dungeons, forcibly converted to Islamism the laity, and destroyed the churches. The Christian religion does not, like the Hindoo, prevent the re-admission into the church of such delinquents; and these involuntary Mahomedans have, in general, reconciled themselves with the clergy, more than 15,000 having returned to Mangalore and its vicinity: 10,000 made their escape from Tippoo to Malabar, from whence they are also returning. These poor people have none of the vices usually attributed to the native Portuguese, and their superior industry is acknowledged by the neighbouring Hindoos.\n\nThe Jain sect abound more in this province than any of India, and at no remote distance of time must have been the prevailing sect; many Jain temples still remain.\n\nThe proper name of the Jain sect is Arhita, and they acknowledge that they are one of the 21 sects who were considered as heretical by Sankara Acharja. Like other Hindoos, they are divided into Brahmin, Kshetri, Vaisya, and Sudra. These castes cannot intermarry; nor should widows burn with their husbands. The Vedas and the 18 Purans of the Brahmans, the Jains reject as heretical. They say that these books were composed by a saint, named Vyasa, whom the orthodox Brahmans consider as an incarnation of the deity. Their chief book of doctrine is named Yoga. It is written in the Sanscrit language and character of Karnata, and is explained by 24 purans, all written by its author, who was named Vrishana Sayana, a saint, who, by long continued prayer, had obtained a knowledge of divine things. They admit that all Brahmans are by birth of equal rank. The gods of the Jains are the spirits of perfect men, who, on account of their great virtue, have become exempt from all change, and are all of equal rank and power. They are called collectively by various titles, such as Jineswara, Arhita (the worthy), and Siddha (the holy).\u2014These saints reside in a heaven called Moesha. Concerning the great gods of the 18 Purans of the orthodox Brahmans, the Jains say that Vishnu was a rajah, who, having performed certain good works, was born a second time as a rajah, named Rama. At first he was a great hero and conqueror; but afterwards he retired from the pleasures of the world, and became a Sannyasi (a solitary devotee), and lived a life of such purity, that he obtained Siddha under the name of Jina, which he had assumed when he gave up his earthly kingdom.\n\nBy the orthodox Brahmans, who follow the doctrines of Vyasa, the Jains are frequently confounded with the Sangata, or worshippers of Buddha. Their doctrine has, in many points, a great resemblance to that which is taught in Ava by the followers of Buddha. The Jain Brahmans abstain from lay affairs, and dress like those who follow the doctrines of Vyasa. Their gooros, or chief priests, have the power of fining their followers who cheat or lie, commit murder or adultery. The fines are given to the gods, that is to say, to the priest.\n\nThe Jains extend throughout India, but at present they are not numerous, except in South Canara. They have two sorts of temples, one covered with a roof, and called Busti; the other an open area, surrounded by a wall, and called Betta, which signifies a hill. In the temples called Betta, the only image of a saint is that of a person named Gomula Raya, who while on earth was a powerful king. The images\nof Gomula Raya are naked, and always of a colossal size. The one at Caroulla is made of a single piece of granite, the extreme dimensions of which, above ground, are 38 feet in height, 10\u00bd in breadth, and 10 feet in thickness. By an inscription on it, it appears to have been made in the year A.D. 1431.\n\nThe Brahmins generally abound in the odium theologicum; it is, however, between the Madual and the Sri Vaishnavam, although both followers of Vishnu, that the most violent antipathy prevails. The Smarta Brahmins, although adherents of Siva, or Mahadeva, agree much better with the Madual; and in South Canara and Malabar these two live on tolerable terms. In South Canara it is not uncommon for one temple to belong to both gods; and, in most places there, the temples of Vishnu and Siva are built near to each other, and the same chariot serves for the procession of both idols. To the east of the Ghants, the Madual Brahmins scorn to serve as priests, even in the temples of Vishnu, and are the proudest of the whole sacred order. They look with abhorrence on the doctrine which inculcates, that the spirits of good men are after death absorbed into the deity; in which they differ both from the Smarta or Siva Bramins, and the Sri Vaishnavam Brahmins. Madna Acharya, the chief of the Madual Brahmins, was born at Paduca Chaytra, about six centuries ago, but had gone through several prior incarnations.\n\nTravancor, Malabar, and South Canara, alone escaped Mahomedan conquest, until the two latter were invaded by Hyder, A.D. 1765-6. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nCane River, (Kena).\u2014This river has its source on the north side of the Vindhya Mountains, in the province of Malwah, and, after a winding course of about 250 miles, falls into the Jumna, in the district of Currah. Major Renoult thinks it is the Cainas; or Cane of Arrian and Pliny.\n\nCandhar, (Gandhara).\u2014A town in the province of Agra, 80 miles S. E. of Jeypoor. Lat. 26\u00b0. 2'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 30'. E. This fortress belongs to the Rajahs of Jeypoor, or Jycnagur, and was built about 80 years ago by one of the rajahs of that state. It is deemed impregnable by the natives, but its chief strength consists in its elevated situation, amidst rugged and projecting rocks, covered with jungle to the top.

E.\n\nCandes.\u2014See Khandesh.\n\nCandahar, (Gandhara).\u2014A province in Afghanistan, situated principally between the 31st and 34th degrees of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by the province of Balk, in Little Tartary; to the south, by Baloochistan; on the east it has Sinde and Baloochistan; and on the west the province of Segistan, in Persia. Having been but little explored, its modern boundaries are wholly unknown. By Abul Fazol, in 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Candahar is situated in the third climate. The length, from Kelat Bujareh, is 300 coss, and it measures in breadth, from Sinde to Furreh, 260 coss. On the east lies Sinde; on the north, Gour and Ghourghistan; on the south, Sewee; and on the west, Furreh and Cabul. On the north-west it is bounded by Ghuznee. The wheat of Candahar is very white, and is sent to a distance as a great rarity. In the vicinity of the town of Candahar are the ruins of a great city, the native place of the Gharian Sultans. Between Hirmund and Candahar is situated the well known city of Meymund, mentioned in old astronomical tables.\"\n\nThe quarter of Afghanistan about Killant (70 miles E. by N. from Candahar) has the general aspect of a desert, and, except small portions\nof arable land contiguous to the inhabited places, no other cultivation is seen. From Ghizni to Candahar the road tends to the south-west, and has universally a barren appearance. The buildings, from a scarcity of timber, are constructed, as in the province of Kabul, of sun-burned bricks, and covered with a flat roof of the same materials.\n\nThis province having been seldom visited by Europeans, we remain but little acquainted with its inhabitants or productions. A native traveller, of 1795 (Seid Mustapha), among other productions, mentions wheat, rice, joarce, gram, peas, and seeds of different sorts; dates, almonds, saffron, and otr of roses. The cultivators he describes as composed of Moguls and Afghans; and the language of the country the Pushtoo. Among the inhabitants he reckons a considerable number of Hindoos (partly Kanoge Brahmins), both settled in the towns as traffickers, and cultivating fields and gardens in the vicinity.\n\nThe face of the country throughout is hilly and rocky, and in many places destitute of fresh water; but some of the vallies exhibit verdure and fertility. The climate during the winter is very cold, although not so much as about Ghizni, in Kabul; but during the summer the opposite extreme is experienced. In the cold season, the poorer sort of inhabitants wear a species of coarse blanket, and the richer classes shawl gowns and long silk caps. Like the rest of Afghanistan, the country is very thinly peopled, a considerable portion of the natives still leading a pastoral and migratory life. The principal domestic animals are camels and dogs, the latter being mentioned as a very superior breed for strength, sagacity, and courage.\u2014Among the wild animals are tigers, buffaloes, deer, and antelopes. Iron is procured from ores found in the hills, and precious stones of various sorts, particularly diamonds and topazes in different parts of the province.\n\nWith respect to religion, the great bulk of the inhabitants are Mahomedans of the Soonee persuasion; and the country abounds with mosques, in which, Seid Mustapha asserts, both Hindoos and Mahomedans worship, and in other respects nearly assimilate. This province has, in general, been considered as an integral part of the Persian Empire; but was for many years subject to the Delhi sovereigns, from whom it was wrested by Nadir Shah. On the death of this usurper it became subject to Ahmed Shah Abdalli, the Afghan Chief of Kabul, and has ever since remained attached to that government, although under a very fluctuating degree of obedience. (Seid Mustapha, Abul Fazel, Foster, &c.)\n\nCANDAHAR.\u2014A fortified town in the province of Candahar, of which it is the capital. Lat. 33\u00b0 N. Long. 65\u00b0 34'. E. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"Candahar is the capital of this Sircar. It has two forts. The heat is very severe, and the cold temperate, except in the months of December and January, when water freezes. Here are flowers and fruits in abundance.\"\n\nNadir Shah destroyed the old fortress of Candahar, which stood on the top of a high rocky hill, and founded on a contiguous plain a city named Nadirabad, which was completed by Ahmed Shah Adalli, but is now only known by the name of Candahar. This modern city, comprised within an ordinary fortification of about three miles in circumference, and of a square form, is populous and flourishing, and standing on the great road which connects Hindostan with Persia and Tartary, has long been a distinguished mart. It is plentifully and cheaply supplied with provisions. The grapes and melons are high flavoured, and equal to those of Europe.\n\nThe environs of Candahar occupy an extensive plain, covered with fruit gardens and cultivation, and\nintersected by numerous streams. The adjacent hills are of a moderate height, and the climate a medium between the heat of India and the cold of Ghizni. Two or three miles to the northward of Candahar are the remains of the old fortress on the summit of a rocky mountain. Six miles from this city are some caverns and ancient excavations, apparently of Hindoo origin; and at two miles distance is the mosque of Zaafer Tayer, a Mahommedan saint, who came from Mecca 790 years ago. South from Candahar is the mosque of the celebrated Moval Ali, where are shewn the marks of his feet in stone. In the vicinity are two enormous pillars lying on the ground, described by Seid Mustapha as being the length of a palmry tree, regarding the origin of which he relates a fabulous story.\n\nAt Candahar are established many Hindoo families, chiefly of Mooltan and the Rajpoot districts, who, by their industry and mercantile knowledge, have essentially augmented its trade and wealth. The Turcomann merchants of Bokhara and Samarcand also frequent this mart, whence they transport into their own country a considerable quantity of indigo, which is received from Hindostan. Among the inhabitants are a few Jews, but it is observed they are never numerous where the Hindoos have settled as merchants and money changers. The Cabul sovereign has a mint established here, which has not of late had much employment.\n\nWhile the Persian and Mogul empires existed in a state of prosperity, Candahar was a frontier city, and the object of much competition. It was betrayed to the Emperor Jahangire by the Persian governor, Ali Merdan Khan, in 1638. On the decay of both empires, it was, for a short time, possessed by native Afghan chiefs; but, in 1737, Nadir Shah, having deposed Thamas Mirza, entered Afghanistan with a large army, and took Candahar, at this time held by an Afghan chief, named Hossein Khan, after a siege, from first to last, of 18 months. On Nadir's assassination, Ahmed Shah Abdali obtained possession, and intended to make it his capital, but in this design he did not persevere; it has, however, ever since continued attached to the Cabul sovereignty.\n\nTravelling distance from Delhi by Cabul 1071 miles; from Agya, 1208; and from Calcutta, 2047 miles. (Foster, Seid Mustapha, Renneil, Abul Fazel, &c.\n\n---\n\nCANDY.\n\nA territory in the centre of the Island of Ceylon, which forms the present dominions of the King of Candy. Woods and mountains, almost impenetrable, cut off this region on all sides from the country on the sea coast, possessed by Europeans. The passes which lead through these to the interior are extremely steep and difficult, and scarcely known even to the natives. 10 or 20 miles inland, the country differs greatly from the sea coast, in soil, climate, and appearance. After ascending the mountains, and passing the woods, the country seems not advanced many stages beyond the first stage of improvement; as we proceed towards the centre of the island, the country gradually rises, and the woods and mountains which separate the different parts become more steep and impervious. It is in the midst of these fastnesses that the native prince still preserves those remains of territory and power, which have been left him by successive invaders.\n\nThe provinces which still remain to him are Noorecalaya and Hotecourly, towards the north and northwest; while Matuly, comprehending the districts of Bintana, Velas, Panoa, with a few others, occupies those parts more to the eastward. To the south-east lies Ouvale, a province of some note; the western parts are\nchiefly included in the provinces of Cotemal and Holleracorley. These different provinces are subdivided into corles, or districts, and entirely belong to the native prince.\n\nIn the highest and most central part of this sovereign's territories lie the corles of Oudanour and Tatanour, in which are situated the two principal cities. These districts are pre-eminent above the rest, and are better cultivated, and more populous than the others; and are distinguished by the name of Conde Udda. This province of Conde Udda is still more inaccessible than the others, and forms as it were a separate kingdom. On every side it is surrounded by lofty mountains covered with wood, and the paths by which it is entered seem little more than the tracts of wild beasts. Guards are stationed all round to prevent entrance and escape.\n\nIn this province are the ruins of some towns, which appear to have been larger and better built than those at present existing. In the province of Nourse Calava, in the northern part of the kingdom, are the ruins of the city of Anuvodgburro. It stands almost at the northern extremity of the Candian dominions, and borders on the district of Jafnapatnam. In former ages this was the residence of the Kings of Ceylon, and has long been the place of their burial. The Portuguese captured and destroyed this town.\n\nThe whole of the Candian territories, with the exception of the plains around Anuvodgburro, present a constant interchange of steep mountains and deep valleys. The excessive thickness of the woods, which cover the greater part of the country, causes heavy fogs and unwholesome damps to prevail; every evening the fogs fall with the close of the day, and are not again dissipated until the sun has acquired great power. The valleys are, in general, marshy, full of springs, and excellently adapted for the cultivation of rice, and rearing of cattle.\n\nThe high range of mountains, which extend across the country of Candy, seems to divide the island into two different climates. It has been a continued drought on one side of them for years, while it has rained on the other without intermission. The seasons among the mountains in the interior are regulated by different laws, and do not correspond exactly with either of the monsoons. Among them it rains incessantly during the months of March and April, at which period it is dry in the low lands. The country of Candy can never receive any improvement from internal navigation: several large rivers intersect it; but, during the rainy season, these are rendered so rapid by the torrents from the hills, that no boat can venture on them; while in the opposite season they are dried up.\n\nThe intercourse betwixt the Cingaleses under the European governments, and the Candians of the interior, has always been more completely cut off, than betwixt any of the most savage and hostile tribes of North America. Even during the intervals of peace no communication is opened, nor is there any attempt on either side to carry on a secret traffic, or correspond with each other. The policy of the Dutch, therefore, succeeded in rendering the Candians completely insulated; and to make them look with apprehension and hostile jealousy, on the approach of a stranger.\n\nThe Candians are divided into castes, which take precedence of each other according to the most scrupulous regulations. The first rank includes the nobles; the next the artificers, such as goldsmiths, painters, carpenters, smiths, &c. the third is composed of lower occupations, such as barbers, potters, weavers, &c. with whom the common soldiers rank; and the 4th caste comprehends the peasantry, and labourers of all descriptions, who either cultivate the lands for themselves, or are hired out to work for\nothers. The preference given to artificers over husbandmen and soldiers, is a very uncommon fact in the arrangement of caste, and peculiar to Ceylon.\n\nBesides these castes, there is here, as in other parts of India, a wretched race of outcastes, the martyrs from age to age of this barbarous institution. They are allowed to exercise no trade or profession, nor to approach any of the human race but the companions of their misery, and whatever they touch is polluted and accursed. As they are not allowed to work, they are obliged to beg continually for sustenance, and thus from generation to generation become a dead weight on society. As they are degraded so low, that they cannot by good conduct ever retrieve their condition, it is an object worthy a benevolent government to attempt converting this lost body of men, by instructing them in a superior system of religion, which must be the first step towards affecting their improvement. These people of no caste are obliged to pay the lowest of the Candians as much respect and reverence, as eastern servility ordains the latter to pay to the king.\n\nAlthough the Candians are governed with the most complete despotism, yet as their prejudices and customs are shared and respected by their monarchs, they are proud of being free from a foreign yoke, and despise the Cingaline in the British service, as a mean and servile race. The Candian women have scarcely ever been seen by Europeans, which concealment must have originated in political motives, as the Candians are by no means jealous of their females.\n\nThe king of Candy on the throne in 1800 was a native of the Island of Ramiseram on the Malabar coast, opposite to Mannaar; and was a descendant of the royal family by a female branch, but by no means the nearest heir. He was brought in by the influence of the adigar, a minister. When the last king has no immediate descendants, and when the hereditary right lies between equidistant males and females, the preference, by the Candian laws, is given to the female branch. In the year 1795, the reigning king of Candy married a Malabar princess of his own country, and a near relation to the Rajah Ramnaad.\n\nThe King of Candy yields to no eastern branch in the number and extravagance of his titles, and they are attended with a corresponding reverence on this part of his subjects. The adigar, or minister, is the only one who has access to his person, he consequently issues what mandates he pleases, and is in effect the sovereign. There are generally two adigars, whom the king endeavours to appoint from opposite factions; but one generally engrosses the power, and appoints the other. The officers next in rank to the adigars are the dessauvas, who are governors or corles or districts, and are the principal military commanders.\n\nThe bulk of the king's revenues consists of presents or contributions brought him by the people, or rather irregularly enforced by his officers, two or three times each year. These contributions consist of money, precious stones, ivory, cloth, corn, fruit, honey, wax, arms, and other articles of their own manufacture, such as spears, arrows, pikes, targets, &c., &c. The regular troops amount to about 20,000 men; but, the inhabitants are obliged, without distinction, to take arms when commanded. Their armour is of a very motley nature; spears, pikes, swords, targets, bows and arrows, matchlocks, with about 1000 fus\u00e9es or muskets, and bayonets, all in bad order. Their pay and subsistence consists of a small allowance of rice and salt, and they are exempted from taxes and all other services.\n\nTo ride on horseback is a royal privilege, monopolized by the monarch. There are no horses kept in\nthe interior, except those belonging to the royal stud; which have been received as presents from the European governments on the coast. In 1782 Mr. Boyd went as ambassador to Candy from Trincomalee. On his arrival within 20 miles of that place, he was desired by the Candians to go round about to the Columbo road, and approach from thence, as they would not otherwise have exact precedents for the ceremonies to be performed. Their capital punishments are always attended with some aggravating cruelty, and the administration of justice is mostly intrusted to the dessauvas and adigars. There are Hindoo temples in Candy, the present king being of the Hindoo Brahminical religion, while the great majority of his subjects are worshippers of Buddha. (Percival, Knox, Harrington, Boyd, &c.)\n\nCandy.\u2014A city in the Island of Ceylon, the capital of the Candian dominions. Lat. 7\u00b0 23'. N. Long. 80\u00b0 47'.\n\nThis town is situated at the distance of about 80 miles from Columbo, and twice as far from Trincomalee, in the midst of lofty and steep hills covered with thick jungle. The narrow and difficult passes, by which it is approached, are intersected with thick hedges of thorn; and hedges of the same sort are drawn round the hills in the vicinity of Candy, like lines of circumvallation. Through them the only passage is by gates of the same thorny materials, so contrived as to be drawn up and let down by ropes. These hedge rows form the chief fortifications of Candy. The Malivagonga River nearly surrounds the hills on which it stands, and is here broad, rocky, and rapid; and on the banks of it a strict watch is kept by the Candians.\n\nThe town is a poor miserable place, about two miles long, and consists of one principal street, terminated by the palace at the upper end. There are many lesser streets branching off, but of no great length. The palace is built with a sort of chunam or cement, perfectly white, with stone gateways. It contains a great many rooms, painted in a grotesque manner, and many of the walls covered with pier glasses. The houses of the town are mean and low, but their foundations are raised in such a manner, or rather the street is so sunk, that they seem lofty to passengers. The palace consists of two enclosed squares, one within the other; and in the inner are the royal apartments, where the court is held, and audiences given.\n\nThis town has been several times burned by the Europeans, and was once deserted by the king, who retired to a still more inaccessible part of his dominions. The ambassadors sent to Candy were always conducted into the town at night by torch-light, and re-conducted before morning, on which account few particulars were known of the town until the 20th Feb. 1803, when it was captured by the British, having previously been evacuated by the king.\n\nThe garrison left here, under Major Davie, were singularly unfortunate. From February to June, officers murdered by the Canadians 16, died from the effects of the climate 16, of the civil service 5; total 37. Privates of the 19th regiment murdered 172, died of the effects of the climate 120, died after their return to Columbo 300; total 592.\n\nAbout six or seven miles to the south of Candy lies the town of Nelemby Neur, where the king has also a palace and stone houses. (Percival, 5th Register, &c.)\n\nCanouj.\u2014See Kanoge.\n\nCandroody.\u2014A small district in the province Gundwana, situated betwixt the 23d and 24th degrees of north latitude. It is intersected by the Soane River, and is possessed by independent chiefs, but contains no town of note.\n\nCantal, (Cantal, the jack fruit\nCANTON.\n\nA sea-port in the empire of China, to which the European maritime traffic is exclusively confined. Lat. 23\u00b0 7' N. Lat. 113\u00b0 14' E.\n\nThis city stands on the eastern bank of the Pe-kiang River, which flows from the interior in a navigable stream of 300 miles to this town, where it is rather broader than the Thames at London Bridge, and from hence falls after an additional course of 80 miles in the southern sea of China, near its junction, with which it takes among foreigners the name of Bocca Tigris. The town is surrounded by walls about five miles in circumference, on which a few cannon are mounted; but the whole of its fortifications, with a view to defence, are in every respect despisable, and only serve to prevent the intrusion of Europeans.\n\nAlthough Canton is situated nearly in the same parallel of latitude with Calcutta, yet there is a considerable difference in their temperature; the former being much the coolest, and requiring fires during the winter months. The suburbs may be frequented by Europeans; but they are not permitted to enter the gates of the Tartar city, which, however, in its building and exterior appearance, entirely resembles the suburbs. The streets of Canton are very narrow, paved with little round stones, and flagged close to the sides of the houses. The front of every house is a shop, and those of particular streets are laid out for the supply of strangers; China-street (named by the seamen Hog-lane) being appropriated to Europeans, and here the productions of almost every part of the globe are to be found. One of the shopkeepers is always to be seen sitting on the counter, writing with a camel's hair brush, or calculating with his swan-pan, on which instrument a Chinese will perform operations in numbers with as much celerity as the most expert European arithmetician. This part of Canton being much frequented by the seamen, every artifice is used by the Chinese retailers to attract their attention, each of them having an English name for himself painted on the outside of his shop, besides a number of advertisements, composed for them by the sailors in their peculiar idiom. The latter, it may be supposed, are often duped by their Chinese friends, who have, in general, picked up a few sea phrases, by which they are enticed to enter the shops; but they suit extremely well together, as the Chinese dealers possess a command of temper not to be provoked, and humour the seamen in all their sallies.\n\nThe foreign factories extend for a considerable way along the banks of the river, at the distance of about 100 yards. They are named by the Chinese hongs, and resemble long courts, or closes, without a thoroughfare, which generally contain four or five separate houses. They are built on a fine quay, and have a broad parade in front. This promenade is railed in, and is generally called the respondentia walk; and here the European merchants, commanders, and officers of ships meet after dinner, and enjoy the cool of the evening. The English hong, or factory, far surpasses the others in elegance and extent, and before each the national flag is seen flying. The neighbourhood of the factories is occupied with warehouses for the reception of European goods, or of Chinese productions, until they are shipped.\n\nFor the space of four or five miles opposite to Canton the river resembles an extensive floating city, consisting of boats and vessels ranged parallel to each other, leaving a nar-\nrow passage for vessels to pass and repass. In these the owners reside with their families, the latter of whom but seldom visit the shore. The Chinese junks that trade to Batavia and the Eastern Islands lie in the centre of the river, moored head and stern, many of them exceeding 600 tons burthen. A Chinese ship, or junk, is seldom the property of one man. Sometimes 40 or 50, or even 100 different merchants purchase a vessel, and divide into as many compartments as there are partners, so that each knows his own particular part in the ship, which he is at liberty to fit up and secure as he pleases. The bulk heads, by which these divisions are formed, consist of stout planks, so well caulked as to be completely water-tight. A ship thus formed may strike on a rock, and yet sustain no serious injury; a leak springing in one division of the hold will not be attended with any damage to articles placed in another, and from her firmness she is qualified to resist a more than ordinary shock. A considerable loss in stowage is of course sustained; but the Chinese exports generally contain a considerable value in a small bulk. Some of these ships are not less than 1000 tons burthen, having a crew of 500 men, owners of goods and seamen, besides other passengers, who leave their country to better their fortunes at Batavia, Manilla, and among the Eastern Islands. The Chinese coasting vessels are usually divided into 13 distinct compartments, well caulked and water-tight. In navigating these vessels the same compass is used as in Europe; but in China the south alone is considered as the attracting power, the Chinese compass is named ting-nan-ching, or the needle pointing to the south. The Chinese junks generally sail with one monsoon, and return with another. In the north-east monsoon they sail to Manilla, Banca, and Batavia, and return to Emoy and Canton with that from the south west. There are five junks annually from Emoy to Batavia, on board of which a considerable number of Chinese emigrate.\n\nCanton is about 15 miles above Whampoa, and in this distance are five chop, or custom-houses, where boats are examined. The head tonnif, named by the mariners John Tuck, regulate the emperor's duties, respecting which the importer remains entirely ignorant, as they are paid by the purchaser of the goods, which are generally weighed and carried off immediately on landing. The cargoes are weighed with English weights of 50, instead of 56 pounds, and afterwards reduced to Chinese catties, by multiplying by three and dividing by four; and then converted to peculs, by dividing the product by 100. A pecul weighs $133\\frac{1}{2}$ pounds English, and catty $1\\frac{1}{2}$ pound; but the Chinese sale weights are generally inaccurate, and must be attended to. All goods in China are bought and sold by weight, even articles of food, such as milk, fowls, hogs, &c. The long measure is the cubit of about $14\\frac{1}{2}$ inches. A tael is equal to 5798 decimal, troy weight; and in the East India Company's accounts the tael of silver is reckoned at 6s. 8d. sterling.\n\nThe Chinese measure a ship from the centre of the fore-mast to the centre of the mizen-mast for the length, and close abaft the mainmast from outside, taking the extreme for the breadth. The length is then multiplied by the breadth, and divided by 10, the result being, according to their ideas, the mensuration of the ship. At the custom-house, ships that arrive are classed under three denominations, first, second, and third rates; and ships, however small, pay as third rates, which is a heavy charge on the small vessels that frequent the port; nor is the duty augmented on ships exceeding the size of what they term first rates. The proportions are,\n\n- 1st rates, 74 cubits long & 28 broad\n- 2d......71 ditto......22 to 23 do.\n- 3d,...,65 to 71 ditto...20 to 22 do.\nThe duties on ships of the smallest class amount, on an average, to about 4000 dollars, and not a great deal more is exacted for ships of larger dimensions. Small country ships frequently lie off about Linting Fora, or Large Bay, until some of the large China ships from Europe come in sight, when they shift their cargoes on board of them. It is usually carried up to Canton for one per cent. by which expedient the duties, customs, and measurement on the ship are saved, as well as the emperor's present.\n\nThe monopoly of all foreign trade is consigned by the policy of the Chinese government to a limited number of merchants, seldom exceeding eight, but occasionally more; in 1793 they were 12, and in 1808 14. All foreign cargoes pass through the hands of these merchants, who are commonly men of large property, and by them also the return cargoes are furnished. With them the East India Company's supercargoes transact the concerns of their employers; they dispose of the goods imported, and purchase the commodities which compose the homeward-bound cargo. At the close of the season they are generally indebted to the Company above half a million sterling, and have, besides, property in their hands belonging to the Company and other British subjects, the aggregate of which has been estimated at two millions sterling.\n\nThe whole establishment of the East India Company here consists of 12 supercargoes and eight writers. The latter have a small annual allowance and a free table; and they succeed in rotation to the situations of the former, who have also a free table, and annually divide among themselves, in shares proportioned to their seniority, a sum seldom falling short of 80,000l. sterling. This arises from a percentage on the import and export cargoes, producing to the chief, on an average, 8600l. per annum; and, to the first, second, and third members of the select committee, above 7100l. The senior supercargo has about 6000l. per annum, and the juniors in proportion declining on a graduated scale; but none of the supercargoes have less than 1500l. per annum. Having an addition to this, the accommodation of a free house and table, they may be considered as the best paid service in the world. The services to be performed for this liberal remuneration consist in a residence for three or four months every year at Canton, during the season of intercourse with the hong, or security merchant, to whom they deliver the imported goods, and receive the teas and other return produce. When the business of the season is finished, the ships laden and dispatched to England, they retire to Macao for the rest of the year, where they remain until the opening of the ensuing season. Here they have very little to do, and are cooped up within a space not exceeding two or three miles, with scarcely any society but what is formed among themselves.\n\nThe external commerce of Canton is very considerable, and the articles of export numerous; but their comparative importance is almost absorbed in that of tea. The imports are more miscellaneous. From Bombay and the Malabar coast they consist chiefly of cotton, pepper, sandalwood, putchick, sharks' fins, olibanum, elephants' teeth, rhinoceros' horns, pearls, cornelians, and beads. From the countries adjacent, to the straits of Malacca, tin, pepper, betelnut, rattans, sea-swallow (biche de mer) and bird nests are imported. The principal articles imported to Canton by the East India Company are cloths, long ells, camblets, lead, and tin. In 1808-9, the value of woollens imported at Canton by the East India Company was 877,569l.; the total value of all their imports, 1,095,317l. sterling. In 1786, the imports of woollens amounted to only 202,023l. Prior to the commutation act, in 1784, the imports of that article were small and extremely diffi-\ncult to sell. The probity, punctuality, and credit of the East India Company and their agents is known to be such by the Chinese, that their goods are taken away as to quantity and quality for what they are declared in the invoice, and the bales with their mark pass in trade, without examination, through many hands and an immense extent of country, and are never opened until they reach the shop of the person who sells for actual consumption. The quantity of British tin imported by the East India Company varies, but may be averaged at 300 tons annually; the Chinese, for many uses, prefer the Banca tin, which they assert is more malleable. The other articles imported from England as private trade by the officers and commanders of the Company's ships are lead, skins and furs, cochineal, window glass, clocks, watches, the latter varying from 40s. a pair to the highest cost. To suit the Chinese taste they must be sold in pairs. The other articles are small quantities of cutlery, hardware, looking glass, and coral; the whole private trade being estimated at 220,000l. per annum.\n\nThe imports from British India are very considerable, but are liable to much fluctuation in quantity. In 1805 the total imports from the British possessions in India amounted to 15,060,577 rupees, consisting of:\n\n| Article       | Value     |\n|---------------|-----------|\n| Cotton        | 9,452,619 |\n| Opium         | 3,294,570 |\n| Piece goods   | 470,561   |\n| Pearls        | 422,987   |\n| Saltpetre     | 287,000   |\n| Sandal wood   | 275,674   |\n| Shark fins    | 251,223   |\n| Grain         | 155,500   |\n\nTotal Sicca rupees 14,606,724\n\nThe remainder was made up of articles of smaller amount and value. Until 1802 the cotton was received entirely from Bombay, but since that period Bengal has supplied a considerable proportion, the whole annual import, on an average, being about 60,000 bales. Opium is prohibited by the Chinese government, yet above 2000 chests are annually imported, the average sale price being about 1200 dollars per chest. The imports from the Eastern Archipelago are various, gold is the most material, but it is impossible correctly to estimate the quantity. The imports of merchandize from foreign Europe and from America are, in many respects, similar to those from England, but small in quantity, bullion being depended on for the purchase of the homeward bound cargo. Of this article the average import from America amounted to half a million annually, and about 100,000l. in goods.\n\nThe principal exports from Canton are tea, china ware, gold in bars, sugar, sugar candy, rhubarb, china root, snake root, sarsaparilla, leather, tutenague, japan copper, varnished and lacquered ware, drugs, leaf gold, utensils made of white and red copper, cast iron, silk raw and wrought, thread, nankeens, mother-of-pearl, gamboge, quicksilver, alum, dammer, red lead, vermillion, furniture, toys, and a great variety of drugs.\n\nIn 1809-10 the cost and charges on the goods exported from Canton by the East India Company amounted to 2,378,883l. sterling, and sold in England for 3,723,116l. The sale amount of goods exported by the commanders and officers in private trade amounted to 353,418l. The quantity of tea sold at the East India Company's sales in 1810 was 24,540,923 pounds, the duty on which was 3,548,860l. In 1806-7 the quantity of tea shipped at Canton on board English ships amounted to 32,683,066 lbs.\n\nOn board of two unknown ships 1,534,267\nIn 1806 on board of American ships 9,644,667\n\nTotal 43,862,000\n\nIn 1807 there was shipped on board of American ships from Can-\nton 7,730,933 lbs. In 1810-11 there was no tea shipped from Canton on board either foreign or American ships; on board of British ships 27,163,066 pounds. The price of the East India Company's teas has continued nearly stationary for above 40 years. Nankcens are made of Chinese cotton in a particular province, and are exclusively a Chinese manufacture. The new teas seldom reach Canton, from the interior, before the month of November.\n\nIn 1805 the total exports to the British possessions in India amounted to sieca rupees 12,676,519, consisting of:\n\n| Item                  | Value   |\n|-----------------------|---------|\n| Bullion               | 8,181,845 |\n| Piece goods           | 599,142  |\n| Sugar and sugar candy | 957,048  |\n| Tutenague             | 592,431  |\n| Camphor               | 361,703  |\n| Tea                   | 301,398  |\n| Raw silk              | 207,743  |\n| Nankcens              | 200,295  |\n| China ware            | 110,637  |\n\nThe remainder was composed of various articles of smaller value and amount. The Chinese make a species of paper from the bamboo, which is an article of export.\n\nThe Russians are excluded from the sea-ports of China, because a trade is carried on with them on the frontiers of Siberia at Kiatcha, and the Chinese do not admit of two places of trade with the same nation.\n\nThe glass, beads, and buttons, of various shapes and colours, worn by persons of rank in China, are chiefly made at Venice; and this is among the remnants of the great and almost exclusive trade which the Venetians carried on with the east. The inhabitants of China make great use of spectacles which are made at Canton, but the artists do not seem to understand any principle of optics, so as to form the eye glasses of such convexities or concavities as to rectify the various defects of vision, but leave their customers to find out what suits them best. The Canton lapidaries cut diamonds, and their artists are extremely expert in imitating European works. They mend and even make watches, copy paintings and colour drawings with great success. They also make coarse silk stockings, and have been long celebrated for their toys, known by the names of balanceers and tumblers. They generally assay their gold here with touch needles, by which it is said they can detect so small a difference as 1-200th part of the mixture.\n\nProvisions and refreshments of all sorts are abundant at Canton, and, in general, of an excellent quality, nor is the price exorbitant. Every description of them, dead or alive, is sold by weight. It is a curious fact, that the Chinese make no use of milk, either in its liquid state, or in the shape of curds, butter, or cheese. Among the delicacies of a Chinese market are to be seen horse flesh, dogs, cats, hawks, and owls. The country is well supplied with fish from the canals and numberless rivers that intersect the country, and the inhabitants breed also great numbers of gold and silver fish, which are kept in large stock ponds, as well as in glass and china vases.\n\nThe lower orders of Chinese, who engage as servants to Europeans at Canton, are extremely ready in acquiring a smattering of the English language, and fertile in inventions for making themselves intelligible to their employers. All the business at Canton with Europeans is transacted in a jargon of the English language. The sounds of such letters as B, D, R, and X, are utterly unknown in China. Instead of these they substitute some other letter, such as L, for R, which occasions a Chinese dealer in rice to offer for sale in English a very unmarketable commodity. The common Chinese salutation is \"hou, poo hou,\" the literal meaning of which is, \"well, not well.\" The name mandarin is unknown among the Chinese, Cochin Chinese, and Tunquinse, the word used by all\nthese nations for a person in authority being quan. Mandarin is a Portuguese word derived from the verb mandar, to command. No correct estimate of the population of Canton has ever been formed, but it is known to be very great.\n\nThe intercourse between Europe and China, by the way of the Cape of Good Hope, began in the year 1517, when Emanuel, King of Portugal, sent a fleet of eight ships to China with an ambassador, who was conveyed to Pekin, and obtained permission to establish a trade at Canton. About 1634 some ships from England visited Canton, but made a most inauspicious commencement, as a rupture and battle immediately took place; but peace was afterwards restored, the misunderstanding being attributed to the treachery of the Portuguese. In 1667 the Court of Directors in their letter to the agent at Bantam in Java desire him, \"to send home by these ships 100 pounds of the best tey (tea) that you can get;\" but the first importation of tea is supposed to have taken place in 1669, when two canisters, containing 143\u00bd pounds, were received by the way of Bantam, as it does not appear any direct intercourse then existed with China. In the year 1678 the Company imported 4713 pounds of tea, but so large a quantity seems to have glutted the market, for the imports of tea for six subsequent years amounted in all to 410 pounds, purchased generally at Surat or Madras. In 1680 we find the first notice of a ship sent direct by the East India Company to China. In 1700 there were three ports open for the reception of English vessels, viz. Limpo, Canton, and Amoy.\n\nSince that period the commerce with Canton has progressively increased, although it has occasionally met with accidental interruptions; as in 1784 and 1801 when two Chinese were killed by shot from British vessels. The most recent difference took place in 1806, when an expedition having been sent from Bengal to garrison Maeao with British troops, the trade was stopped, but the troops being subsequently withdrawn, an amicable arrangement took place, and the trade resumed its usual course.\n\nTchieu-Laung, the old Emperor of China, resigned his throne to his 15th son, the present sovereign Kea-King, in February, 1796, having completed a reign of 60 years. He died in February, 1799, aged 89 years. Since the accession of the present monarch the reins of government appear to have been considerably relaxed, as insurrections have been frequent, and some of them at no great distance from Canton. Although, in general, there are a much greater number of troops quartered throughout the province of Canton than in any other, a precaution necessary on account of the great influx of foreigners to the port. The sea coast has also been so much infested by pirates as to threaten the extinction of the Chinese coasting and foreign trade in their own vessels. (Staunton, Barrow, Milburn, Elmore, Johnson, Macpherson, Quarterly Review, &c.)\n\nCanyapura, (the Town of the Virgin).\u2014A small town, containing about 200 houses, in the district of South Canara, situated on the south banks of a river which surrounds the town and fort of Cumly. Lat. 12\u00b0. 34'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 4'. E. The inhabitants are chiefly Moplays, Mucuas, Mogayers, and Concanees. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nCap and Button Isles.\u2014Two small isles in the Straits of Sunda, the first lying in lat. 5\u00b0. 58'. S. Long. 105\u00b0. 48'. E.; the second in lat. 5\u00b0. 49'. S. Long. 105\u00b0. 48'. E. They appear to have been originated by a subaqueous volcano.\n\nIn the Cap are two caverns running horizontally into the side of the rock, and in these are found a number of the bird nests so much prized by the Chinese. They seem to be composed of fine filaments, cement-\nCARIMATA.\n\n... together by transparent viscous matter, not unlike what is left by the foam of the sea upon stones alternately covered with the tide, or those gelatinous animal substances found floating on every coast. The birds that build these nests are small grey swallows, with bellies of a dirty white. They are very small, and so quick of flight, as to be shot with difficulty. The same nests are said to be found in deep caverns, at the foot of the highest mountains in the middle of Java, at a great distance from the sea, from which, it is thought, the birds derive no materials, either for their food or the construction of their nests. They feed on insects which they find hovering over stagnated pools between the mountains, and it is supposed they prepare their nests from the remnants of their food.\n\nThe nests are placed in horizontal rows, at different depths, from 50 to 500 feet. Their value is chiefly determined by the uniform fineness and delicacy of their texture, those that are white and transparent being most esteemed, and often selling in China for their weight in silver. The birds having spent two months in preparing their nests, lay each two eggs, which are hatched in about 15 days. When the birds become fledged their nests are seized, which is done regularly thrice a year, with the assistance of bamboo and rope ladders. These nests are an object of considerable traffic among the Javanese, but it does not appear that the swallows frequent the southern extremity of Sumatra.\n\nA good birds' nest is about the size of a small china cup, almost as white as writing paper, and as transparent as isinglass, with a very few downy feathers hanging about it. The common black nests are more plentiful, and may be had anywhere to the eastward, but they are full of feathers and dirt. The thickness of the nests is about that of a silver spoon, and their weight, when dry and brittle, from a quarter to half an ounce. (Staunton, Elmore, &c.)\n\nCAPALUAN.\u2014A small island, one of the Philippines, lying due south of the Island of Luzon, distant four miles, Lat. 13\u00b0. 50'. N. In length it may be estimated at 14 miles, by five the average breadth.\n\nCARAMNASSA, (Carma nasa, the destruction of pious works).\u2014A small winding river, which separates the province of Bahar from that of Benares.\n\nBy an ancient text the Hindoos were forbidden even to touch the waters of the Caramnassa, but the inhabitants on its banks claim an exemption which is admitted by the other Hindoos, although their aversion to the Caramnassa continues as great as ever. By the contact alone of its baneful waters, pilgrims suppose they lose the fruit and efficacy of their religious austerities and pilgrimages, and they always cross it with the utmost caution. Major Reumel thinks it is the Commenasses of Arian.\n\nOn crossing this river on service from Bahar, the Bengal officers receive an additional pay, to enable them to defray the increased expenses they are subjected to in the upper provinces. (Wilford, Foster, &c.)\n\nCARANJA.\u2014A small island in the harbour of Bombay, named by the natives Uran.\n\nCARULLA.\u2014An open town in the province of South Canara, containing above 200 houses. Lat. 13\u00b0. 12'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 4'. E. Near this place are the ruins of the palace of the Byrasu wodears (chiefs), the most powerful of the former Jain Rajahs of Tulava, or South Canara. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nCARIMATA.\u2014A small island, about 30 miles in circumference, lying off the west coast of Borneo, betwixt the first and second degrees of south latitude. This island is high and woody, with a peak in the middle, which is generally cloud capped. It is inhabited.\nCarimon Java.\u2014An island about 20 miles in circumference, in the Java sea, surrounded by a cluster of smaller ones. Lat. 5\u00b0. 45'. S. Long. 110\u00b0. 15'. E. The middle one is of considerable size, and as well as the smaller ones that encompass it, is covered with wood.\n\nCarawang.\u2014A district on the north-west coast of the island of Java, adjacent to Batavia.\n\nCarli.\u2014Some remarkable caverns in the province of Aurungabad, situated opposite to the fort of Loghur, from which they are distant about four miles, and 30 miles N. W. from Poonah.\n\nThe chain of hills here runs east and west, but the one in which the caves are protrudes from them at right angles. The chief cave fronts due west. Here are an extensive line of caverns, the principal of which consists of a vestibule of an oblong square shape, divided from the temple itself, which is arched and supported by pillars. The length of the whole is 126 feet, the breadth 46 feet. No figures of the deity are to be found within the pagoda, but the walls of the vestibule are covered with carvings in alto relievo of elephants, of human figures of both sexes, and of Buddha, who is represented in some places sitting cross legged, and in others erect. There are numerous inscriptions on the walls. The ribs of the roof are timber, and cannot be supposed of equal age with the excavation, and are difficult to be accounted for, the worship of Buddha having been so long superseded by the Brahminical religion.\n\nA line of caves extends about 150 yards to the north of the great one. These are flat-roofed, and of a square form, and probably were occupied by the attendants on the temple. In the last is a figure of Buddha. The Carli caves are said to be 6000 feet above the level of the sea.\n\nThe difference between the caverns of Elephanta and Carli are striking. Here are no personifications of the deity, and no separate cells for sacred rites. The religious opinions which consecrated them are no less different, the first having been dedicated to the deities of the Brahminical sect, and the last to those of the Buddhists, or of the Jains. (Lord Valentia, M. Graham, &c.)\n\nCarmulla, (Carimalle).\u2014A town in the territories of the Poonah Maharattas, in the province of Aurungabad, 100 miles E. from Poonah. Lat. 18\u00b0. 23'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 32'. E. This is a considerable town, with a stone fort, which has a double wall, and a ditch between them; a long ditch also surrounds the outer wall. (Upton, &c.)\n\nCarnaprayaga.\u2014A village in northern Hindostan, in the province of Serinagur, situated at the confluence of the Macananda with the Pindar River, which comes from the S. E. Lat. 36\u00b0. 17'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 15'. E. This is one of the five prayagas, or holy places, mentioned in the Shastras, and considered as the third in point of consequence. The village consists only of six or eight houses, with a math, or shrine, in which is placed the image of Raja Carna. (Raper, &c.)\n\nCARNATIC, (Carnata).\n\nThe large province, denominated the Carnatic by Europeans, comprehends the former dominions and dependencies of the Nabob of Arcot, and extends from the 8th to the 16th degrees of north latitude. The northern boundary commences at the southern limits of the Guntoor circle, defined by the small River Gundezama, which falls into the sea at Moutapilly. From hence it stretches south to Cape Comorin, a distance of about 560 miles in length, but of an unequal breadth, the average being about 75 miles.\n\nThe region south of the River Coleroon is called the Southern Carnatic, and was rather tributary to the Nabobs of Arcot than a real pos-\nsession. Prior to the British sovereignty it was occupied by numberless rajahs, polygars, and other petty chiefs, and subdivided into the districts of Tinnevelly, Madura, Mawras, the polygar's territory, part of Trichinopoly and Tanjore; the principal towns being Tanjore, Trichinopoly, Madura, Tranquebar, Neganapatam, and Tinnevelly.\n\nThe central Carnatic extends from the Coleroon to the River Pennar, and contained the remainder of Trichinopoly, Volconda, Palamecotta, Gingee, Wandewash, Conjee, Vellore, Chingleput, Chandgherry, Serdamilly, and part of Nelloor; the chief towns being Madras, Poudicherry, Arcot, Wallajahbad, Vellore, Cuddalore, Gingee, Pulliatt, Chandgherry, and Nelloor.\n\nThe Northern Carnatic extended from the River Pennar to the River Gundezaama and the Guntoor circular, and included the remainder of Nelloor, Ongole, and some smaller districts; the chief towns being Ongole, Carwarce, and Sangauum. This last region in ancient Hindoo times was termed Andhra, and reached to the Godavary. The sovereigns were called Andhras about the beginning of the Christian era, at which time the Andhra, or Andara kings, were very powerful in India.\n\nThe principal rivers are the Pennar, the Palar, the Cavery, and the Vaggaroo, all of which have their sources in the table land above the Ghauts. The vast height of these mountains, and their great extent, not only fix the boundaries of the two Carnatics above and below the Ghauts, but by stopping the course of the winds likewise divide the seasons.\n\nThe climate of the Carnatic may be considered as one of the hottest in India, although somewhat relieved on the sea coast by the prevalence of the land and sea breezes. It is common in May, June, and July, to have occasional showers, and at some periods of that time to have even three or four days heavy rain, which cools the air, and enables the cultivation for dry grains to take place. The weather in July, though hot, is cloudy, with strong winds from the west.\n\nIn the greater proportion of the Carnatic the soil is sandy, and water being scarce, much exertion is required to procure it. In such districts as have not the advantage of being watered by considerable rivers, or in parts where the water cannot be conveyed from them to the adjacent fields, tanks are made, which being filled during the periodical rains, furnish water for the rice fields, and for the cattle in the dry season. Some of these are of great extent, and were originally made by enclosing deep and low situations with a strong mound of earth. Others of less magnitude for the use of temples, towns, or gardens, are of a quadrangular form, lined with stone, and descending in irregular steps from the margin to the bottom.\n\nIn the towns, as well as the villages, and along some of the principal high roads, are choultries, in the native language called chauvadi, from which probably the English term choultry is derived. These public buildings, for the reception of travellers, have been erected and endowed by the magnificence of the prince, the generosity of some rich individual, or not uncommonly in consequence of some pious vow. A Brahmin resides near, who furnishes the traveller with food and a mat to lie on; and contiguous is a tank, or well, for the pilgrims to perform their ablutions. Everywhere, within 40 or 50 miles of Madras, such useful buildings are very common, and have been erected and endowed by rich native merchants of that city.\n\nThe only trees that grow spontaneously on the barren parts of the Carnatic are, the melea azadirachta, and the robinia mitis, the last of which flourishes both on the arid hills of the Carnatic, and on the muddy banks of the Ganges. Very little of the soil betwixt Ori Permaturu and\nVira Pernal Pillays Choultrywill, at the usual rent repay the expense of cultivation, and in the present state of the population it would not be expedient to let it at low rents, as by that means useless labourers might be taken from more valuable lands. The only good water in this neighbourhood is preserved in tanks; that which is found in wells is called salt by the natives, although the quantity of muriat of soda contained in it is very small. Famines and scarcities are much more frequent in the Carnatic and south of India, than in the Bengal provinces.\n\nIn all those districts of the Carnatic, into which the permanent system of revenue assessments has been introduced, the condition of the cultivators has been improved; because, although the assessment was originally fixed at one half of the produce, in the course of time, by improvements, the half is reduced to one third, one fourth, and even to a fifth part of the actual produce.\n\nThere are few countries that can exhibit so many large temples, and other public monuments of wealth and civilization, as the Carnatic; almost all the pagodas are built of the same form. A large area, which is commonly a square, is enclosed by a wall 15 or 20 feet high, and in the middle of the area are the temples, which, as if intended to be concealed from public view, are never raised above the height of the surrounding wall. In the middle of one or more of the sides of this wall is a gateway, over which is built a high tower, not designed as a defence of the pagoda, but as a historical monument of the gods to whom it is dedicated, representing the attributes and adventures of these divinities.\n\nThere were an astonishing number of forts and fortresses formerly in the Carnatic, mostly built of a square form. They are now, in consequence of the long internal tranquillity, rapidly going to decay; but the natural strength of the situations on which they are placed will forever remain, and point out their former site. Villages and towns in an open country are but a day in duration, compared with fortresses, especially when the latter derive any portion of their strength for their natural situation.\n\nThe great mass of the population in this extensive province profess the Hindoo religion of the Brahminical persuasion, the Mahommedans being but thinly scattered over the country, except at the nabob's court, and a few other places. In 1785 there were reckoned to be about 20,000 native Christians of the Roman Catholic sect; and the Christians of all descriptions probably amount, at present, to double that number. The population of the Carnatic, in its most extensive sense, may be estimated at five millions of souls. They are considered inferior in bodily strength to the Rajpoets, and other natives of Hindostan Proper.\n\nThe greater part of the Brahmans throughout the Lower Carnatic follow secular professions. They almost entirely fill the different offices in the collection of the revenue and administration of justice, and they are, exclusively, employed as messengers and keepers of choutries.\n\nMuch of the land is rented by them, but, like the Jews, they seldom put their hand to actual labour, and on no account will they hold the plough. Their farms are chiefly cultivated by slaves of the inferior castes, called Sudras, and Punchum Bicchum. These last are by far the most laborious people of the country, but the greater part of them are slaves. So sensible was Hyder of their value, that, during his incursions, this was the caste he principally endeavoured to carry away. There are a few Mahommedan farmers who possess slaves, but the most numerous class of farmers is composed of Sudras. Some of these possess slaves, but many of them cultivate their farms with their own hands.\nThroughout this province the ass is a very common animal. The breed is small, as in Bengal, but there is an uncommon variety of colour among them. Some are of the usual ash colour, while others are almost black, in which case the cross on their shoulder disappears. They are kept by five classes of people, who are all of low castes, the higher ranks disdaining the use of so impure an animal. One of these is a wretched caste, named Chensu Carir, who are described as having neither house nor cultivation. One common article of their food is the white ant, or termites. They travel from place to place, conveying their children and baggage on asses.\u2014Every man has also a cow, instructed like a stalking horse, by means of which he approaches game, and shoots it with arrows.\n\nThe most numerous class of Brahmans (comprehending one half of all the Brahmans in the Lower Carnatic) is named the Smartal sect, who are votaries of Mahadna or Siva, and followers of Sankara Acharya. Throughout both Carnatics, except at Madras, the Brahmans appropriate to themselves a particular quarter of every town, and generally that which is best fortified. A Sudra is not permitted to dwell in the same street with a Brahmin, while he exacts the same deference from the Whalliaru or Pariar, and other low castes. These people generally live in wretched huts about the suburbs.\n\nIn both the Upper and Lower Carnatics taking snuff is much more common than in Bengal; smoking, on the contrary, is in great disrepute. The hookah is totally unknown, except among Mahomedans. The lower classes smoke cigars, but a Brahmin would lose caste by such a practice; and it is considered unbecoming even among the richer part of the Sudra tribe.\n\nThroughout the southern parts of India fowls are a common article of diet with the lower castes, whereas in Bengal their use is confined entirely to Mahomedans. In Bengal ducks and geese are commonly used by the Hindoos, but in the south of India these birds are not at all domesticated, except by Europeans.\n\nNotwithstanding the great resort of Europeans, and other foreigners to the Carnatic, the genuine Hindoo manners are retained by the great majority in wonderful purity. If any person, leaving Madras, goes to the nearest Hindoo village, not a mile into the country, he is as much removed from European manners and customs, as if he were in the centre of Hindostan.\n\nFrom that part of the Carnatic situated between the Rivers Palar and Coleroon, the articles of produce or manufactures exported to Madras are chiefly piece goods, consisting mostly of blue cloths, salampores, coarse chintzes, &c. the blue cloths are again re-exported, as are many of the other coloured goods, to the eastern markets. Among the other articles sent from this quarter to Madras, are rum, indigo, grain, and numerous smaller commodities. The imports from Madras are very inconsiderable.\n\nThe first irruption of the Mahomedans into the Carnatic was in A.D. 1310, during the reign of Allah ud Deen on the Delhi throne, when they defeated Belal Deo, the Hindoo sovereign. After this period occasional tribute was paid to the Deccan sovereigns, and subsequently to the Mogul emperors, but actual possession does not appear to have been taken until towards the conclusion of Aurengzebe's reign, in the commencement of the 18th century. In the year 1717, Nizam ul Mulk obtained possession of the Mogul conquests in the Deccan and south of India, which from that period ceased to form part of the empire.\n\nIn 1743 Anwar ud Deen was appointed Nabob of the Carnatic and Arcot by Nizam ul Mulk, the Soubahdar of the Deccan; and, in 1754,\nafter severe contests betwixt the different claimants, aided by the French and English East India Companies, his son, Mahommed Ali, was left in possession of that portion of the Carnatic recovered for him by the British arms. In 1763 it was again surrendered to the Nabob Mahommed Ali, after being wrested from the French, the contest having, in all, lasted 15 years; in 1783 the British had again to reconquer it from Hyder Ali.\n\nMahommed Ali died the 13th of October, 1795, and was succeeded by his son, Omdut ul Omra, who died the 15th of July, 1801, when Azim ul Amrah was raised to the throne.\n\nIn 1801, the whole of the possessions of the Nabob of Arcot, situated in the Carnatic, with the exception of a small portion reserved by him as the household lands of himself and family, were transferred to the Company by treaty. Of the lands situated in the southern division of the Carnatic, consisting of the Tinevelly and Manapara Pollams, and the two marawars, Rannad and Shevagunga, and of those situated to the westward, called the Western Pollams, the Company had collected the tribute since 1792. In 1795, the Pollams of Rannad came directly under the charge and management of the Company. The remaining part of the Carnatic territories, acquired by the treaty of 1801, consisted of the districts of Palnaud, Nelloor, Angole, the province of Arcot, the Pollams of Chittoor, and the districts of Sativaid, Tinevelly, and Madura.\n\nBy the treaty, the nabob reserved to himself a clear revenue of from two to three lacks of pagodas annually, unincumbered by any charge, the British government undertaking to support a sufficient civil and military force for the protection of the country, and collection of the revenue. A liberal establishment was also provided for the other branches of the family of Mahommed Ali Khan.\n\nAfter this event the country was subdivided into the following collectorships, which comprehend also a few districts from the Upper Carnatic, viz.\n\n1. Nelloor and Ongole, including part of the western pollams, or zemindaries.\n2. The northern division of Arcot, including Sativaid, Pullicat, Coongody in the Barramahal, part of Balaghaut, and the western pollams, or zemindaries.\n3. Chingleput, or the Jaghire.\n4. The southern division of Arcot, including Cudalore and Pondicherry.\n5. Trichinopoly.\n6. Tanjore.\n7. Dindigul, including Madura, Manapara pollams, Rannad, and Shevagunga, partly in the Carnatic, and partly in Mysore.\n8. Tinevelly, in the Southern Carnatic.\n\n(C. Buchanan, 5th Report, T.

When ceded to the British by the Nizam in 1800, it was in a very desolate state, on account of the ravages it had sustained, but its condition has been since greatly ameliorated. The chief town is Carnoul.\n\nCarnoul.\u2014A town in the Balaghaut ceded districts, situated on the south side of the Toombuddra River. Lat. 15\u00b0. 50'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 58'. E.\n\nIn 1752 this was the capital of a petty Patan sovereignty, which had never been completely subdued by the Mogul dynasty. It was then taken by the Nizam Sakabut Jung, through the assistance of M. Bassy's army, and its garrison of 4000 Patans cut to pieces. It is still the residence and jaghire of a Patan chief, who is tributary to the Company, whose northern boundary in this\nquarter is the Toombuddra, which joins the Krishna, a few miles below Carnoul.\n\nTravelling distance from Hyderabad 127 miles S. S. W. from Madras, 279; and from Seringapatam, 279 miles. (Orme, 5th Report, Rennel, &c.)\n\nCarnoul.\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, district of Hajypoor, 50 miles N. from Patna. Lat. 26\u00b0. 16'. N. Long. 83\u00b0. E.\n\nCaroor.\u2014A town in the south of India, in the district of South Coimbatore, 42 miles W. from the town of Trichinopoly. Lat. 10\u00b0. 53'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 12'. E. This town is situated on the north bank of the Amarawati, or Caroor River, and contains above 1000 houses. At a little distance from the town is a neat fort, with a large temple, and a garrison of sepoys. The supply of water in the Amarawati does not last the whole year, so that in some seasons there is only one crop of rice. Near the river the rice grounds are extensive, and fully cultivated.\n\nThe river of Caroor was the ancient boundary between the dominions of Mysore and Trichinopoly, and this conterminous situation, under the security of a strong fort, and its rule over a rich and extensive district, had formerly rendered it a place of great mercantile resort and opulence. This place was taken in 1760, during the Carnatic wars, by Captain Richard Smith, from Trichinopoly, and probably before this event no European troops had advanced so far west inland.\n\nCarrar.\u2014A town in the province of Bejapoor, district of Mortizabad, situated on the south side of the River Krishna. Lat. 17\u00b0. 25'. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 15'. E.\n\nThis is a considerable town, being a mile in length, and nearly as much in breadth, well inhabited, and with a good market. Nearly in the centre of the town are two pagodas of great height and elegant workmanship. There is a fort here, but without guns. From hence to Satarah is a pleasant valley, well inhabited and cultivated, being intersected by many streams. (Moor, &c.)\n\nCarrianers.\u2014A singular description of people in the Birman empire, who inhabit different parts of the country, particularly the western provinces of Dalla and Basseen, several societies of whom also dwell in the districts adjacent to Rangoon. They are a simple, innocent race, speaking a language distinct from that of the Birmans, and entertaining rude notions of religion. They lead a pastoral life, and are the most industrious subjects of the state. Their villages form a select community, from which they exclude all other sects; and they never reside in a city, intermingle, or marry with strangers. They profess, and strictly observe, universal peace, not engaging in war, or taking any part in the contests for dominion; a system that necessarily places them in subjection to the ruling power of the day. Agriculture, the care of cattle, and rearing of poultry, are almost their only occupations. A great part of the provisions used in the country is raised by the Carrianers, and they particularly excel in gardening. They have of late years been heavily taxed and oppressed by the great Birman landholders, in consequence of which numbers have withdrawn into the mountains of Aracan.\n\nThey have traditional maxims of jurisprudence for their internal government, but are without any written laws. Custom with them constitutes law. Some learn to speak the Birman language, and a few can write it imperfectly. They are timorous, honest, mild in their manners, and exceedingly hospitable to strangers. This people are not found higher up than Prome. One of them being interrogated, accounted for their state of ignorance, and assigned as a reason, that God once wrote his laws and commands upon the skin of a buffaloe, and called upon all the nations of the earth to come and take a copy, which they\nall obeyed except the Carriancers, who had not leisure. (Symes, \u00a7c.)\n\nCarnaul.\u2014A town in the province of Delhi, 70 miles N. by W. from the city of Delhi. Lat. 29\u00b0. 41'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 48'. E.\n\nCarnicobar Isle.\u2014The most northerly of the Nicobar Islands, in the Bay of Bengal. Lat. 9\u00b0. 8'. N. Long. 92\u00b0. 53'. E.\n\nThis island is low, of a round figure, about 40 miles in circumference, and appears, at a distance, to be entirely covered with trees. The soil is of a black kind of clay, and marshy, and produces in great abundance, with little care, most of the tropical fruits, such as pine apples, plantains, cocoanuts, also excellent yams, and a root named caclu.\u2014The only quadrupeds in the island are hogs, dogs, large rats, and a large animal of the lizard kind. There are poultry, but not in plenty. Snakes abound, some of the venomous kind. There is great plenty of timber, and some of it remarkably large. The natives require money for their provisions, and also expect knives, handkerchiefs, and other useful articles as presents. Ships calling here may obtain pigs, fowls, cocoa nuts, betel nut, papaws, plantains, limes, and shaddock. A species of ginger grows wild in the island.\n\nThe natives are low in stature, but well made, and surprisingly active. They are copper-coloured, and their features have a caste of the Malay; the females are extremely ugly. They are naturally gay and lively, and drink arrack, when offered them, in large quantities. Many of them speak a broken English, mixed with Portuguese, which facilitates intercourse with ships. Their hogs are remarkably fat, being fed upon cocoa nut kernel, which is the food also of their dogs, fowls, and other domestic animals. The houses of the natives are generally built upon the beach, in villages of 15 or 20 houses each. They are raised about 10 feet from the ground, and resemble bee-hives, having no windows. The entry is through a trap-door below, where the family mount by a ladder, which is drawn up at night.\n\nThey do not manufacture any cloth; what they have is procured from ships, which come to trade for their cocoa nuts, which are reckoned the best in India. The articles they prefer in exchange are cloths of different colours, hatchets, and hauger-blades. They have no money of their own, and use part of the coin which they procure as ornaments. Their intercourse with strangers is so frequent, that they have acquired, in general, the barbarous jargon of the Portuguese, so common over the Indian sea-coast.\n\nWhen a man dies all his goods are burned with him, which prevents disputes among the heirs. On this occasion his wife must conform to custom, by having a joint cut off from one of her fingers; and if she refuses this, she must submit to have a deep notch cut in one of the pillars of her house. Their religion is imperfectly understood, but seems to have no affinity with that of any of the adjacent nations. There appears to subsist a perfect equality among them; the more aged are respected, but exercise no coercive authority.\n\nThe Danes formed a settlement about 1760 on this island, to which they conveyed a considerable number of cannon, and named New Denmark; but the pestilential nature of the climate compelled them to abandon it. (G. Hamilton, Lord Valentia, Haensel, \u00a7c.)\n\nCartinaad.\u2014See Cadutinada.\n\nCarwar, (Cadawada).\u2014A town in the province of North Canara, 54 miles S. by E. from Goa. Lat. 14\u00b0. 49'. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 4'. E.\n\nThis was formerly a noted seat of European commerce, the English East India Company having had a factory here so early as 1673; but, during the reign of Tippoo, the town went to total ruin. It is situated in that part of the Cancon, compre-\nbounded by the mountains of Tibet; on the south-east and south by Kishetwar, in the province of Lahore; and on the S.W. by Lahore, Muzaffarabad, and some other independent districts. Including the surrounding mountains, Cashmere may be estimated at 120 miles in length, and 70 in extreme breadth, the figure nearly an oval. The limits of Cashmere towards the west, adjoining Muzaffarabad, are terminated by a low thick wood, the edge of which is skirted by a rivulet; and on the other side rises a chain of lofty mountains stretching to the north and south. In 1582 this province is described by Abul Fazel as follows:\n\n\"The soubah of Cashmere is situated partly in the third, and partly in the fourth climate. It is composed of Cashmere, Bhember, Sewad, Bijore, Candahar, and Zebulestan (Cabul). Formerly it had Ghizni, but now it has Cabul for its capital. The length from Kimberdine to Kishengung is 120 coss, and the breadth from 10 to 25 coss. On the east lies Peeristan and the River Chenaub; on the south-east Bankul and the mountains of Jumnaoo; on the N.E. Great Tibet; on the west Puckholi and Kishengung; on the south-west the territory of Gickher; and on the north-west Little Tibet. It is encompassed on all sides with lofty mountains. There are 26 roads into Hindostan, but those of Bhember and Puckholi are the best, being passable for horses.\"\n\nThe whole of Cashmere represents a garden in perpetual spring, and the fortifications with which nature has furnished it are of an astonishing height. The water is remarkably good, and the cataracts magnificent. It rains and snows here at the same season as in Tartary and Persia; and, during the periodical rains in Hindostan, here also light showers fall. The soil is partly marshy, the rest well watered by rivers and lakes. Violets, roses, narcissuses, and innumerable other\n\n---\n\n**CASIMERE, (Casmira.)**\n\nA province of Northern Hindostan, situated principally between the 34th and 35th degrees of north latitude. The Valley of Cashmere is of an elliptic form, and extends about 90 miles in a winding direction from the south-east to the north-west. It widens gradually to Islamabad, where the breadth is about 40 miles; which is continued with little variation to the town of Sampre, whence the mountains by a regular inclination to the westward come to a point, and separate Cashmere from Muzaffarabad. To the north and north-east Cashmere is\nflowers grow wild here. Earthquakes are very frequent; on which account the houses are built of wood. The inhabitants live chiefly upon rice, fresh and dried fish, and vegetables, and they drink wine. Their horses are small but hardy; they breed neither elephants nor camels. In their cities and towns are neither snakes, scorpions, nor other venomous reptiles; but the country in general abounds with flies, gnats, bugs, and lice. Most of the trade of the country is carried on by water, but great burdens are also transported on men's shoulders.\n\nThe Cashmereans have a language of their own; but their books are written in the sanscrit tongue, although the character be sometimes Cashmerian. They write chiefly upon teoz, which is the bark of a tree. The Mahommedans are partly Sunnies, and others are of the sects of Ali and Noorbukhshay. Here are many delightful singers, but they want variety.\n\nThe Hindoos regard the whole of Cashmere as holy land; 45 places are dedicated to Mahadeva or Siva; 64 to Vishnu; three to Brahma; and 22 to Durga (the wife of Mahadera). In 700 places are carved figures of snakes, which they also worship.\n\nAlthough formerly government was said to take only a third of the produce of the soil; yet, in fact, the husbandmen was not left in the enjoyment of nearly one-third. His majesty (Acber) has now commanded that the crops shall be equally divided, between the husbandman and the state. There are but few troops in Cashmere, the native standing army being only 4892 cavalry, and 92,400 infantry.\n\nThe ancients divided Cashmere into two parts only, calling the eastern division Meraje, and the western Kaunraj. In the history of Cashmere, it is said, that in the early ages of the world, all Cashmere, except the mountains, was covered with water, and was then named Suttysir. Sutty is one of the names of Mahadeva's wife, and sir signifies a reservoir. In the year of the Hijera 948, (A.D. 1541), Mirza Hyder was sent against Cashmere by the Emperor Humayoon, and by the help of some of the natives conquered the whole of that country, and part of Great Tibet.\"\n\nThe lower range of mountains, which surround Cashmere, are of a moderate height, and covered with trees and verdure, affording excellent pasture for all sorts of cattle and wild gramminivorous animals; and containing none of the larger and more ferocious carnivorous animal, such as lions and tigers. Beyond this range are mountains of a more elevated description, whose snow-clad tops, soaring above the fogs and clouds, appear perpetually bright and luminous. By ascending from the plains up the mountains any degree of cold may be attained. From these mountains flow innumerable cascades and rivulets, which the inhabitants conduct through their rice fields, for the purpose of irrigation; and in their course form small lakes and canals, the junction of which afterwards forms rivers, navigable for boats of considerable magnitude even within the limits of Cashmere; and, increasing as they flow southward, form several of the largest rivers by which Hindostan is fertilized. Among these mountains are many romantic vallies, the inhabitants of which have scarcely any communication with those of the plains; and, on account of their poverty and the inaccessible situation of their dwellings, never have been subdued by any of the conquerors who have devastated Cashmere. The religion of primitive tribes is unknown, but is probably some modification of the Brahminical tenets.\n\nThe valley of Cashmere is celebrated throughout Asia for the romantic beauty of its situation, the fertility of its soil, and the temperature of its atmosphere. It is generally of a flat surface, and being copiously watered, yields abundant\ncrops of rice, which is the common food of the inhabitants. The facility of procuring water ensures the crop against the injuries of a drought, and the mildness of the climate against the scorching effect of the sun. At the base of the surrounding hills where the land is higher, wheat, barley, and various other grains are cultivated. In this province are found most of the plants, flowers, fruit, and forest trees, common to Europe; particularly the apple, pear, plum, apricot and nut trees, and abundance of grapes; and in the gardens are many kitchen herbs peculiar to cold countries. A superior sort of saffron is also produced in Cashmere, and iron of an excellent quality is found in the mountains. The sengeralh, or water-nut, which grows in the lakes, forms a considerable portion of the food of the lower classes.\n\nMany lakes are spread over the country, and there is a tradition, which appearances tend to confirm, that the Cashmere Valley was once the bed of a large lake, which at last opened itself a passage into Hindostan, by the channel of the Jhyum River. Besides this river and the Chota Singh River, there are numberless mountain streams supplied by the rains, which fall among the hills with great violence from June to October, and form many cascades and small cataracts which are precipitated into the valley, where the periodical rains are described as only descending in gentle showers. The principal towns of the province are Cashmere, named also Srinagur, Islamabad, and Sampre.\n\nThe wealth and fame of Cashmere have greatly arisen from the manufacture of shawls, the wool of which is not produced in the country, but brought from districts of Tibet, lying at the distance of a month's journey to the north east. It is originally of a dark grey colour, and is bleached in Cashmere by the help of a preparation of rice flower. This raw material of the Cashmere shawls is a wool, or rather a down, that is protected by the coarse hair of a goat, which is bred in Tibet. Neither the Delhi emperors, who made various attempts to introduce the breed of the shawl goat into the upper provinces of India, nor the sovereigns of Persia, have ever been able to succeed in procuring wool of an equally fine quality with that of Tibet. The Persian shawl from the wool of Kerman comes nearer the Cashmere shawl than the English.\n\nAfter the yarn of the wool is prepared, it is stained with such colours as may be judged best suited for a sale, and after being woven the piece is once washed. The border, which usually displays a variety of figures and colours, is attached to the shawls after fabrication; but, in so delicate a manner, that the junction is not discernible. The price at the loom of an ordinary shawl is eight rupees; thence, in proportion to quality, it produces from 15 to 20 rupees, and some of a very fine quality sell so high as 40 rupees the first cost. The flowered work greatly adds to the expense, and altogether 100 rupees is occasionally given. A large proportion of the Cashmere revenue is transmitted to the capital in shawl goods.\n\nThe Cashmereans also fabricate the best writing-paper of the east, which was formerly an article of extensive traffic, as were its lacquered ware, cutlery, and sugar; but trade of all sorts is now in a very languid state. A wine resembling Madeira is manufactured in this province, and a spirituous liquor is also distilled from the grape. Auritsir, in Lahore, the Seik capital, is at present the grand emporium for the shawls and saffron of Cashmere. The boats of Cashmere are long and narrow, and are moved with paddles. The country being intersected by numerous streams, navigable for small vessels, might greatly benefit under a better government by this commodious internal conveyance. As there are no caravanserais in\nCashmere, commercial strangers are generally lodged with their brokers.\n\nIn the time of Aurangzebe the revenue collected in Cashmere was three and a half lacks of rupees per annum; in 1783, the Afghan governors, on behalf of the Kabul sovereign, extorted above 20 lacks. At that time the army of the province was about 3000 horse, chiefly Afghans, the natives seldom engaging in any military occupation, which is averse to their genius and disposition.\n\nThe natives of Cashmere are stout, well-formed people, and their complexions what in France or Spain would be termed brunette. They are naturally gay and lively people, and eager in the pursuit of wealth. They are accounted much more acute and intriguing than the natives of Hindostan generally, and proverbially liars. They are also much addicted to the cultivation of literature and poetry, and the common people remarkably ingenious in cabinet work of all descriptions. They have not the slightest resemblance to their Tartarian neighbours, who are an ugly race of people; on the contrary, the Cashmenian females have been celebrated for their beauty and complexions, and on that account much sought after for wives by the Mogul nobility of Delhi, that the breed might not degenerate. Although fertile, the country is not thickly populated, on account of the miserable governments to which it has so long been subjected. The whole number are probably much under half a million, a great proportion of whom are Hindoos, professing to follow the Brahminical doctrines. All Cashmere is reckoned holy land by the Hindoos, and abounds with miraculous fountains. The language of Cashmere springs from a sanscrit stock, and resembles that of the Maharatas; their songs are composed in the Persic, which they consider less harsh.\n\nPrior to the Mahommedan conquest of India, Cashmere was celebrated for the learning of its Brahmans and the magnificence of its temples. The period of its subjugation is uncertain; but it was attacked and ravaged by Mahmood of Ghizni so early as A.D. 1012. It was governed in a long succession by a race of Tartar princes, of the Chug or Chugatay tribe, until 1586, when it was subdued by Acher, and remained annexed to the house of Timur for 160 years, after which it was betrayed by the Mogul governor, about 1754, to Ahmed Shah Duranny, and constituted a province of the Afghan sovereignty of Kabul until 1809, when Mahommed Khan the soubahdar, on the part of the Kabul, revolted, and has ever since maintained his independence, both against the Afghan sovereigns, and Ranjeet Singh, the Seik Rajah of Lahore. (Foster, Abul Fazel, Bernier, Rennel, Malcolm, &c.)\n\nCashmere, (or Serinagur). \u2014 A town in the province of Cashmere, of which it is the capital. Lat. 34\u00b0 20' N. Long. 73\u00b0 43' E. In 1582, it is described by Abul Fazel as follows:\n\n\"Serinagur, the capital of Cashmere, is four farsangs in length. The last mentioned one is dry during a part of the year, and the Mar is sometimes so shallow, that boats cannot pass through it. This city has been for ages in a flourishing state; and here are manufactured shawls and other fine woollen stuffs. On the east side of the city is a high hill, called the mountain of Soliman, and adjoining are two large lakes, which are always full.\"\n\nThe town of Cashmere was formerly known by the name of Serinagur, but now by that of the province. It extends about three miles on each side of the River Jalum, over which are four or five wooden bridges; and it occupies, in some part of its breadth, which is unequal, about two miles. The houses, many of them two and three stories high, are slightly built of brick and mortar, with a large intermixture of tim-\nOn the wooden roof is laid a covering of earth, which affords warmth in winter, and during the summer is planted with flowers. The streets are narrow, and choked with the filth of the inhabitants, who are proverbially unclean; and there are no buildings worthy of remark. The sonbahdar, or governor of Cashmere, resides in a fortress, called shereghur, occupying the south-east quarter of the city.\n\nThe benefit which this city enjoys, in a mild salubrious air, and a river flowing through its centre, is essentially alloyed by its confined construction and the extreme filthiness of the people. There are covered floating-baths ranged along the sides of the river.\n\nThe Lake of Cashmere, named in the provincial language the Dall, has long been celebrated for its beauties. It extends from the north-east quarter of the city, in an oval circumference of five or six miles, and joins the Jahum by a narrow channel, near the suburbs. The northern view of the lake is terminated, at the distance of 12 miles, by a detached range of mountains, which slope from the centre to each angle; and from the base, a spacious plain, preserved in constant verdure by numerous streams, extends with an easy declivity to the surface of the water. In the centre of the plain, as it approaches the lake, one of the Delhi emperors, probably Shah Jelian, constructed a spacious garden, called Shalimar. The numerous small islands in the lake have the effect of ornamenting the scene.\n\nBernier, who visited this country in 1693, when travelling in the suit of the Emperor Aurengzebe, gives a most interesting and romantic description of this city; but since the dismemberment of Cashmere from the empire of Hindostan by the Afghans, this city has greatly decayed, and its buildings been suffered to crumble into ruins. Travelling distance from Lahore, 587 miles; from Agra, 724; from Lucknow, 866; from Bombay, 1277; from Calcutta, 1564; and from Madras, 1882 miles. (Foster, Renouf, Abul Fazel, Bernier, &c.)\n\nCashy, (Cashki).\u2014A small district in Northern Hindostan, tributary to the Ghurkali Rajahs of Nepaul, and situated between the 28th and 29th degrees of north latitude. Respecting this petty state very little is known, except that it forms part of the region named the country of the 24 Rajahs. The country is very mountainous.\n\nCashy.\u2014A town in Northern Hindostan, the capital of a small district of the same name, in the country of the 24 Rajahs, and tributary to Nepaul. Lat. 28\u00b0. 42'. N. Long. 82\u00b0. 49'. E.\n\nCassai River.\u2014This river has its source in the province of Bahar, district of Ramghur, and not far from the town of Ramghur, from whence it flows in a south-easterly direction, passing the town of Midnapoor in its course; after which it falls into the western, or Hooghly branch of the River Ganges, a few miles below Diamond Point.\n\nCassay.\u2014A province in the Birman empire, situated about the 24th degree of north latitude. This country is bounded on the north by Cachar and Assam; on the south by Aracan, and the rude tribes bordering on that country; on the west it has the Bengal districts of Tipperah and Sylhet; and on the east it is separated from the original Birman territories by the River Keenduemu, which, taking a south-eastern course, unites its waters with those of the Irravaddy, a short way above the town of Sembawghewn. The capital city is Munipoor, and by the inhabitants of Bengal the Cassayers are called Muggaloos, an appellation with which they themselves are totally unacquainted. This name the Europeans have applied to the country, turning it into Meckley. Kathee is the name given to this people by the Birmans, which has been taken for the name of the country, and\ncorrupted into Cassay; the natives of which call themselves Moitay.\n\nThe Cassayers have a softness of countenance much more resembling the natives of Hindostan than the Birmans, with whom they have very little affinity either in manners or appearance. Many of these people, taken prisoners in the wars, are now settled in the neighbourhood of the Birman capital, Ummerapoor, where their superior skill and industry, in different branches of handicraft work, supply them with a comfortable subsistence. They cultivate pulse, greens, onions, and such vegetables as the Birmans use, and transport them across the lake to Ummerapoor, where they retail them in the market.\n\nThe gunsmiths of the Birman empire are all Cassayers, but their guns are extremely defective. They are also much better horsemen than the natives of Ava, and on that account are the only cavalry employed in the Birman armies, and very much resemble those met with in Assam. They ride like all orientals, with short stirrups and a loose rein; their saddle is hard and high, and two large circular flaps of hard leather hang down on each side, which are painted or gilded according to the quality of the rider. The music of the Cassayers is remarkably pleasant and consonant to the English taste, in which the time varies suddenly from quick to slow. With the religion of the Cassayers we are imperfectly acquainted; but there is reason to believe a great majority possess the Brahminical doctrines; and, in the basis of their character and dispositions, they much more resemble a regular Hindoo tribe, than the harsh and brutal followers of Buddha. Their country may be considered as the extreme limits of the Brahminical Hindoo sect to the eastward, as from hence the prevalence of the Buddhist doctrine in some shape is universal.\n\nIn the year 1754, when Alompra, the Birman monarch, left the city of Ava to relieve Prome, he detached a body of troops across the Keenduem to chastise the Cassayers, who had hitherto enjoyed only a temporary independence, when the contests of the Birman and Pegue states left them no leisure to enforce obedience. They were always ready to revolt, and quickly reduced to submission. The Rajah of the Cassayers, residing at Munnipoor, sued for peace, which was concluded on advantageous terms for the Birmans; and, as is the custom, a young man and young woman of the rajah's kindred were delivered as hostages.\n\nIn 1757 Alompra again attacked the Cassayers, and ravaged their country, but was prevented completing the conquest by the revolt of the Peguers. In 1765, Shembnan, the son of Alompra, invaded the Cassay country, and obtained considerable booty, but appears to have intended nothing beyond a predatory excursion; but, in 1774, he sent a formidable force against the Cassayers, which, after a long and obstinate battle, took the capital Munnipoor, the rajah having withdrawn to the Corrum hills, five days' journey north west of that place. From this period the Cassay country has remained subject to the Birmans. (Symes, F. Buchanam, &c.)\n\nCatanduanes Isle.\u2014One of the Philippines, situated off the east coast of Luzon.

It is a very hilly and woody district, and is intersected by the River Beyah.\n\n**CATMANDOO, (Cashthamandir, the wooden metropolis).**\u2014A town in Northern Hindustan, situated in the valley of Nepaul Proper, 40 miles from the lofty Himalaya Mountains. Lat. 27\u00b0. 33\u2032. N. Long. 85\u00b0. 39\u2032. E.\n\nThis place is reckoned the present capital of Nepaul, being the residence of the Ghoorkhali rajah. It stands on the east bank of the Bisshennutty, along which it extends about a mile; its breadth is inconsiderable, no where exceeding half a mile, and seldom extending beyond a quarter of a mile. The name by which it is distinguished in ancient books is Gungool-putten; the Ne-wars call it Yindaise, whilst amongst the Parbuttees, or mountaineers, it is stiled Kathipoor, an appellation which seems to proceed from the same popular source with Catmandoo, a name derived, it is said, from its numerous wooden temples. These appear to differ nothing from the wooden mundabs, or mundirs, occasionally met with in other parts of India, and are principally remarkable for their number and size. Besides these there are many brick temples, with three or four sloping roofs.\n\nThe houses are built of brick and tile, with pitched or pent roofs towards the street. They are of two, three, and four stories, and almost without exception of a mean appearance, even the rajah's house being but a sorry building. The streets are very narrow, and nearly as filthy as those of Benares. Catmandoo was reckoned to contain 22,000 houses during the time of Jye Purkhaush, and they have since augmented at the expense of Patu and Bhatgong. This statement must be understood to comprehend, not only the population of the town itself, but of its dependent villages, there not being above 5000 houses on the ground occupied by the city. Allowing 10 persons to a house or family, which is probably a low estimate for the houses of Catmandoo, its population will amount to 50,000 souls.\n\nAt the same rate, the numbers occupying the remaining 17,000 houses, formerly included within the jurisdiction of Catmandoo, would be 170,000; but, in the country, eight may be taken as the average, which would give 186,000 for the total population of the capital and its districts. Among the latter, in this estimate, are not included Doona-baise, Noakote, Nerjah, nor any of the dependencies of the Catmandoo sovereignty lying beyond the valley. (Kirkpatrick, &c.)\n\n**CAUGMARRY, (Cagmari).**\u2014A small town in the province of Bengal, district of Mymunsingh, 38 miles N. N. W. from Dacca. Lat. 24\u00b0. 15\u2032. N. Long. 89\u00b0. 48\u2032. E.\n\n**CAULAHANDY.\u2014**A town possessed by independent chiefs, in the province of Orissa, 50 miles N. E. from Bustar. Lat. 20\u00b0. 7\u2032. N. Long. 83\u00b0. 15\u2032. E.\n\n**CAULABAUGH, (Khsharabag, the garden of salt).**\u2014A town on the west side of the Indus, in the province of Cabul, 116 miles N. by W. from Mooltan. Lat. 32\u00b0. 11\u2032. N. Long. 70\u00b0. 46\u2032. E.\n\nAt this place the country inhabited by the real Afghans begins, and from hence to Peshawer are a...\ngreat variety of tribes. It is here also that the Indus is first confined to one stream, between the banks of which it cannot overflow. Caulabaugh has been long noted for an inexhaustible store of the finest rock salt, and it is enriched by considerable alum works. The salt is sold at 25 maund (of 80 lbs.) per rupee, and transported on camels and bullocks to the Punjab, Mooltan, and the other lower parts of the Kabul dominions. The alum also is bartered in trade.\n\nThe houses of the inhabitants are built on platforms cut out of the declivity of the hill, and the inhabitants are an Afghan tribe, named Awans. The stream of the Indus at Canabaugh, between the two nearest points of the opposite hills, is from three to 400 yards broad. The adjoining hills are remarkable on account of their fantastic shapes, the rain having washed down their crumbled substance, leaves to the last the highest and hardest parts, which often are seen standing on bases much smaller than their summits. (11th Register, &c.)\n\nCAUNPOOR, (Khanprna).\u2014A town in the province of Allahabad, situated on the west side of the Ganges, 49 miles S. W. from Lucknow, Lat. 26\u00b0. 30', N. Long. 80\u00b0. 21'. E. A brigade of Company's troops is cantoned here, it being considered as the chief military station in the ceded provinces. There are barracks for 400 artillery, two king's regiments, one of cavalry, three of native cavalry, and 7000 native infantry. The officers of every description find their own lodgings, which consist of very commodious and elegant bungalows, built without any regularity, on a space extending about six miles along the Ganges.\n\nCaunpoor is situated on the upper part of that vast plain, which extends from the Bay of Bengal to the northern mountains approaching Tibet. The soil of it is not only all arable, but with proper cultivation capable of being rendered extremely fertile. Agriculture in the neighbourhood of Caunpoor has profited by the stimulus of a European market and high prices. Indian corn, grain, barley, and wheat, are cultivated; and turnips, cabbages, and European vegetables, are, during the season, in great abundance, not only in the gardens of the officers, but in the fields cultivated by the natives. Grapes, peaches, with a profusion of fruit, have long been supplied by the Europeans.\n\nIn their season sugar canes, and other crops, flourish in this part of the country in great luxuriance; cultivation is, however, often interrupted by the intervention of extensive wastes, which might be easily rendered as productive as the rest of the land.\n\nThe troops here, during the dry season, suffer great annoyance from the dust, which they cannot possibly avoid. From the middle of October to the middle of June there is seldom a shower of rain; the ground, consequently, becomes parched to a cinder; all vegetation, except on watered fields, being destroyed. The tread of horses, camels, and bullocks, loosens each day a certain quantity of dust from the surface, which the winds that regularly blow in the afternoon raise into the air in the form of a thick cloud, which nearly hides the sun, and envelopes the station in darkness. The history of the country affords many instances of battles, lost and won, according to the direction of the dust, the windward position giving a decided advantage. Wolves abound here, which frequently dash into some corner of the camp, and carry children under five years of age, which happen to be straggling among the huts.\n\nAfter the cession of the surrounding country of the Doab, in 1802, by the Nabob of Oude, a district was attached to the Caunpoor station, and a civil establishment appointed for the administration of justice, and the collection of the revenue. (Tenant, Lord Valentia, Rennel, &c.)\nCAVAL.\u2014A small Moplay town in the province of Malabar, 28 miles N. N. W. from Tellicherry. Lat. 12\u00b0 3'. N. Long. 75\u00b0 20'. E. In 1749 the English had a factory here, which consisted of a pandiaka, or banksalt; which Dutch word has now, in general, been adopted by the natives of the whole Malabar coast.\n\nIn 1759 the French built a fort on the south side of the river, where they remained 10 years. Afterwards an Elia Rajah (as the husband of the Ribby of Cananore is named) built a fort on each side of the southern river. These two forts are now in ruins, and the influence of the Cananore family entirely superseded by that of Choncara Mousa, a Mahomedan merchant of Tellicherry, whose authority extends unrivalled over the Moplays from Cavai to Mangalore. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nCAVERY, (Cuvier).\u2014A river in the south of India, which rises among the Coorg hills, near the coast of Malabar, passes through the Mysore, Coimbetoor, and the Carnatic below the Ghants; and, after a winding course of nearly 400 miles, falls into the sea by various mouths in the province of Tanjore.\n\nOpposite to Trichinopoly, in the Carnatic, the Cavery separates into two branches, and forms the Island of Seringham. About 13 miles to the eastward of the point of separation the branches again approach, but the northern branch is at this place 20 feet lower than the southern. The northern branch is permitted to run waste to the sea, and is named the Coleroon; but the southern, which retains the name of Cavery, has been led into a variety of channels by the skill and industry of the early Hindoos, to irrigate the province of Tanjore, and is the cause of its extraordinary fertility. Near to the east end of the Island of Seringham is formed an immense mound, to prevent the waters of the Cavery from descending into the Coleroon. (Wilks, &c.)\n\nCAVERYPAUK.\u2014A large town in the Carnatic, district of Conjee. Lat. 12\u00b0 59'. N. Long. 79\u00b0 32'. E. Here is a great cray, or tank, about eight miles long by three broad, which fertilizes a considerable tract of country. From Culoor to Caverypauck the barren ridge on which the road leads is narrow, and the country being abundantly supplied with water from the great tank has a handsome appearance. After passing Caverypauck towards Arcot, the barren ridge is more extensive, and in most places consists of immense beds of granite, or of that rock decomposed into coarse sand, almost destitute of verdure. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nCAVERYPATNAM.\u2014A town in the south of India, district of Kistnag-herry, situated on the banks of the Pauaur River, 103 miles east from Seringapatam. Lat. 12\u00b0 29'. N. Long. 78\u00b0 22'. E.\n\nCAVERYPORUM.\u2014A town in the district of North Coimbetoor, 85 miles S. E. from Seringapatam. Lat. 11\u00b0 49'. N. Long. 77\u00b0 55'. E. This town is situated on the banks of the Cavery, which, in the rainy season, is here a wide, strong, but smooth stream, no where fordable; but in the dry season there are many fords. The country is, in general, level, but very stony, and full of rocks even with the surface.\n\nThe fort of Caveryporum is said to have been built by Guttimodaly, who was polygar of a considerable part of the neighbouring country. The suburbs contain about 100 houses, with the ruins of a much greater number. There is a custom-house here, this being an entrepot of trade between the countries above and below the Ghants. The goods are carried on oxen, and tobacco is the principal article. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nCAVITE.\u2014A town in the Philippines, situated three leagues S. W. from Manilla, within the Bay of Manilla, it being the proper harbour of that city. Lat. 14\u00b0 34'. N. Long. 120\u00b0 48'. E.\n\nIt was once of greater size and\nconsequence, but now has, in general, only a garrison of 150 men, who occupy the castle of St. Philip, which is of a square form, with four bastions. All the other inhabitants are mulatoes, or Indians, employed at the arsenal, and, with their families, form a population of 4000 souls. The Jesuits formerly possessed a very handsome house here, but the whole is much decayed; the old stone houses being abandoned, or occupied by Indians, who never repair them. The depth of water is excellent, as ships may lie within musket shot of the arsenal; but Cavite Bay is infested by a species of worm, which penetrates the planks and timbers of ships, and renders them soon unfit to keep the sea. Although so near to Manilla, being actually within the bay, boats going from the one to the other are often taken by piratical Malay praws, and the people sold for slaves. (La Peyrouse, Sonnerat, &c.)\n\nCAYAGAN SOOLOO ISLES.\u2014A cluster of islands in the Eastern Seas, lying off the north-eastern coast of Borneo. Lat. 7\u00b0 N. Long. 118\u00b0 50' E. The largest, about 20 miles in circumference, is of a middling height, covered with trees, and the soil rich and luxuriant. In 1774 this island was dependent on Sooloo, and much frequented by the mangleo, or piratical praws. The tide rises here six feet on the springs. (Forrest, &c.)\n\nCAYLE RIVER.\u2014A small river, which has its source in the districts to the south of Palamow, in the province of Bahar, from whence it pursues a northerly-winding course until it joins the Soane in the district of Rotas, after a course, including the turnings, of about 150 miles.\n\nCAYVARUM.\u2014A town in the south of India, district of Gurumaconda, 85 miles S. W. from Cudapah. Lat. 13\u00b0 36' N. Long. 78\u00b0 21' E.\n\nCEDED DISTRICTS.\u2014See BALAGHAUT.\n\nCERA ISLE.\u2014A small island, about 20 miles in circumference, lying off the west side of Timorlaut. Long. 131\u00b0 50' E.\n\nCERAM.\u2014A large island in the Eastern Seas, extending from the 128th to the 130th degrees of east longitude, and situated principally betwixt the third and fourth degrees of south latitude. In length it may be estimated at 185 miles, by 30 miles the average breadth.\n\nA chain of very high mountains, parallel in their direction, runs from east to west, the valleys betwixt which shew every sign of a vigorous vegetation. The highest of these mountains from the sea appears to be 7000 feet in elevation. The peninsula of Hoeawamoehil, or Little Ceram, is joined to the main land by a narrow isthmus, and, in ancient times, produced large quantities of cloves and nutmegs, but the trees were extirpated by the Dutch about the year 1657. The wood which is usually called Amboyna, and the Salmoni, both of which are exported from Amboyna, for cabinet work, are mostly the production of Ceram. At present the peninsula of Hoeawamoehil is covered with sago trees. Along the shores of Ceram uncommonly fine shells are found.\n\nRumphius describes the wild mountains and interior of this island as being inhabited by the Horaforas, or Alforeze, the aborigines of all the islands west of the Papua, or Oriental Negro Isles. He says they are a tall, strong, and savage people, in general taller than the inhabitants of the sea shores. Both sexes go nearly naked, only wearing a bandage about their waists, made of the bark of a tree. Their weapons are a bamboo sword, and bows and arrows. They had many barbarous and bloody religious rites, which the Dutch writers have greatly exaggerated. (Stavorinus and Notes, Labillardiere, Bougainville, &c.)\n\nCERAM LAUT ISLES.\u2014A cluster of small islands lying off the east end of the Island of Ceram, about the 130th degree of east longitude, and Lat. 3\u00b0 55' S.\nCELEBES.\n\nA large island in the Eastern Seas, of a most irregular shape, separated from Borneo by the Straits of Macassar. It extends from latitude 2\u00b0 N. to nearly latitude 6\u00b0 S. and from 119\u00b0 to 125\u00b0 east longitude; but the coast is so indented by three deep bays, that it is difficult to form an estimate of its actual surface. Making allowance, however, for the inequality of its figure, it may be estimated at 500 miles in length, by 150 miles the average breadth.\n\nThis island is called by the natives and Malays Neegree Oran Buggess, or Buggess Man's Country, and sometimes Tanna Macassar. It is situated between the great island of Borneo on the west, and the islands of Gilolo, or Halamahera, Poby, Ceram, and Amboyna to the east; to the south lies Salayer, divided from Celebes by a strait, called by the Dutch the Budgeroons. Further to the south lies Floris, or Ende, Timor, and Sumbhawa; to the north there is a broad sea, and the Island of Sangir to the north-east.\n\nA deep gulf runs into the island from the south called Sewa by the natives, but Buggess Bay by the English. There is also a deep gulf penetrates the north-east part of the island, the proper name of which is Tominee; but it is also named Gorantella, or Gunongtelln (Hill Harbour). It reaches so deep from the north-east into the island, that the isthmus which divides it from the west sea is very narrow, forming a peninsula. On the north-east of this peninsula is Manado, or Fort Amsterdam, a Dutch settlement, whence much gold is received in exchange for opium and Hindostan piece goods, chiefly blue cloths, fine Bengal cossacs, hummums, iron, and steel. There is also a third gulf, but not so deep as the other two, which indents the east quarter, called Tolo Bay.\n\nThe principal native states, or divisions, of this island, according to the Dutch authorities, are Macassar, Boni (the Buggess country), Tello, Soping, Looboe, Taute, Mandhar, Warjoor, or Wadjo, Touradja, and Cajelec, under which heads respectively further topographical details will be found.\n\nCelebes has three rivers: Chinrana, the most considerable, takes its rise in the Warjoo country, runs through Bony, and discharges itself by several mouths into the Sewa Gulf. European ships can ascend this river a considerable way over a muddy bottom. The second is the River Boli, with three fathoms water on its bar, which discharges itself, after a winding course at Boli, on the north coast. The third discharges itself on the west coast of the island, a considerable way south of Macassar.\n\nOn the east coast of Celebes the Dutch have the two settlements of Manado and Gorantalo, from whence they exported rice and other necessaries to Ternate. These stations yield a considerable quantity of gold, about 24,000 taels of $1\\frac{1}{2}$ dollars in weight yearly, amounting to 120,000l. and also the esculent bird nests so much admired by the Chinese. In exchange for these commodities, the natives, besides the articles above enumerated, take a considerable quantity of Bengal opium.\n\nThe chief productions of this island are rice, which it can afford to export; and cotton, of which the natives make womens' dresses, called cambays, which are much esteemed all over the Eastern Archipelago. The Buggess cambays, though often only one garment, which completely covers the wearer, are often sold from six to 10 Spanish dollars each. Some are as fine as cambric, very strongly wove, but dull coloured, being a chequered fabric, resembling tartan. The export to Bencoolen of cambays was formerly so great, that it was necessary to lay a heavy duty on the article, as it interfered with the importations from Hindostan. The Buggesses also manufacture, from the inner bark of a small tree,\na kind of paper, in which they wrap their fine cambays. This paper they dye of various colours, and export much of it to Manilla, and various other places. It resembles the Otaheite clothing. The Buggesses import cotton, both raw and spun, into yarn, from the Island of Bally, and manufacture beautiful silk belts for their creesces; we are not informed from whence they procure the silk, but it is probably the production of China.\n\nThe Macassars and Buggesses make fire arms, but they cannot make gun locks. They also cast small brass guns, which they call Rantakha, and are curious in filagrec-work, both in gold and silver. The large rantakhas are about six feet long, and carry balls of half-a-pound weight. They build their prows very tight, by dowling their planks together, as coopers do the head of a cask, and putting the back of a tree between them, which afterwards swells. They then fit their timbers to the planks as at Bombay, but do not rabbit the planks, as is the custom there. Their largest prows seldom exceed 50 tons burden, and they are bigotted to old models and fixtures in fitting up their vessels.\n\nThe natives of Celebes have a great disposition for commerce, navigation, and piracy. In these prows they are to be met with all over the Eastern Seas, and are often found on the northern coast of New Holland, where they go to fish for sea swallow, or biche de mar, which they sell to the annual Chinese junk when it arrives at Macassar. To Bencoolen they used to carry, in fleets, a mixed cargo, consisting of spices, wax, cassia, saudel wood, dollars, and the cloths of Celebes, called cambays. This traffic is now, in a great measure, transferred to Prince of Wales Island; and they also, in their prows, visit Malacea, Acheen, Queda, and Manilla; on trading voyages.\n\nThe gold of Celebes is generally procured, as on Sumatra, from the beds of rivers and torrents. There are many springs issuing from crevices of rocks, that bring some little gold along with their water, which, filtering through a vessel bottomed with sand, leaves the metal behind.\n\nOf the various nations who inhabit Celebes the Bounians, or Bouginese (called Buggesses by the English), and the Macassars, are the best known; the latter having been long in subjection to the Dutch. The Buggesses are at present the most powerful nation on the island. They are of a middling stature, strong and muscular, and of a light brown complexion. The Macassars are not so handsome, but have a more manly and martial appearance. Their dress consists of a piece of cotton cloth, red or blue, wound round the body, and drawn tight between the legs. Upon their heads they wear a piece of cotton cloth like a handkerchief, with which they cover their hair, which is very black and long. Their food is rice, fish, and pisang, and their drink water; though they likewise have sagwire, or palm wine. The Bouginese women are, in general, handsomer than the females of the other islands, and the Macassars and Buggesses are considered, by the other insulars, as a class of superior manners. The Malays affect to copy their style of dress, and frequent illusions are made in their songs to the feats and achievements of the Buggesses, who are a high-spirited people, fond of adventures and navigation, and capable of undertaking the most dangerous enterprises. Among Europeans in the Eastern Isles the word Buggess has come to signify a soldier, the same as sepoy on the Continent of Hindostan. Their laws are administered according to old customs handed down from their ancestors, and generally merely retained in the memory of their oran tuo, or old men, though, in some parts, they are committed to writing. In dubious cases they\nrefer to the Koran, if applicable. The religion of the Macassars, Bug-\ngesses, and Malays of the sea-coast, is the Mahommedan, which allows\nthe men four legal wives, if they can maintain them; but, in the in-\nterior, there are tribes not yet con-\nverted from their ancient religion,\nand others who do not seem to have\nany.\n\nThe Buggess may be reckoned\nthe original language of the Island\nof Celebes. The Malays on the\nsea-coast speak a dialect greatly\nmixed with Buggess, and often use\nthe Buggess character to express\ntheir own language. Celebes was\nformerly divided into seven princi-\npalities, which were all united un-\nder an elective and limited mo-\nnarchy. In this state the island was\nthe centre of eastern commerce, and\nextended its conquests, on the one\nhand, as far as the Island of Balji;\nand, on the other, beyond the Mo-\nluccas. The Buggess language was\nassiduously cultivated, and their an-\ncient mythology, traditions, laws,\nand history, preserved in books, the\ngreater part of which are still ex-\ntant, especially in the interior,\namong the tribes who still adhere to\ntheir ancient religion. The dialect\nof Macassar differs considerably\nfrom the proper Buggess; but the\ndialects of Loboe, Eurekang, Mand-\nhar, and especially of Toaradja, ap-\npear almost different languages.\n\nThis island appears to have been\nknown to Magellan and Pigafetta,\nunder the name of Celebi, but was\nnot explored until 1525. The Por-\ntuguese early obtained a settlement\nnear Macassar, but were expelled by\nthe Dutch in 1660, who have, until\nlately, entirely controlled the island,\nthe Chinese alone being permitted to\ntrade with it. In consequence of the\nincreasing strength of the state of\nBoni, the proper country of the\nBuggesses, during the last half of\nthe 18th century, the power of the\nDutch had been much on the de-\ncline in Celebes, and it was finally\nannihilated, in 1812, by the reduc-\ntion of Macassar, and Fort Rotter-\ndam, in 1812, by the British forces.\n(Forrest, Stavorinus and Notes, Ley-\nden, Marsden, &c.)\n\nCEYLON, (Singhala).\n\nThis island is situated at the\nwestern entrance of the Bay of Ben-\ngal, between 5\u00b0. 40' and 10\u00b0. 30'.\nN. and 79\u00b0. and 82\u00b0. E. On the\nN.W. it is separated from the\nCoromandel Coast by the Gulf of\nManaar, and is distant about 160\nmiles from Cape Comorin. From\nPoint Pedro, at the northern ex-\ntremity, to Dondrahead in the south-\nern, the extreme length is about 300\nmiles. The breadth is very unequal,\nbeing, in some parts, only from 40\nto 50, while, in other parts, it ex-\ntends to 60, 70, and 100 miles. To-\nwards the southern part it is much\nbroader than in the northern, and\nnearly resembles a ham in shape.\n\nFrom the sea it presents a fresher\ngreen, and more fertile appearance\nthan most parts of the Coromandel\ncoast. The eastern shore is bold and\nrocky, and the water deep. The\nnorth and north-west coast from\nPoint Pedro to Columbo is flat, and\nindented with inlets from the sea.\nThe largest of them extends almost\nquite across the island from Mulli-\npati to Jaffnapatnam, of which it\nforms the peninsula. Several of these\ninlets form small harbours, but so\nfull is the N.W. coast of sand banks\nand shallows, that it is impossible\nfor vessels of a large size to approach\nthem.\n\nThe interior of the island abounds\nwith steep and lofty mountains,\ncovered with thick forests, and full\nof almost impenetrable jungles, which\ncompletely surround the dominions\nof the King of Candy. The most\nlofty range of mountains divides the\nisland nearly into two parts, and so\ncompletely separates them from each\nother, that both climate and season\ndiffer on the respective sides. These\nmountains also terminate the effect\nof the monsoons, which set in pe-\nCeylon was originally divided into a number of distinct petty kingdoms, separated by rivers and mountains, and subject each to its own independent sovereign. In process of time the whole country was subjected by the King of Candy, and divided into a few great provinces, viz. Candy, Coitou, Matura, Dambadar, and Sitivacca, which last formerly included the rich cinnamon districts on the west coast. The chief of these provinces was Candy, the residence of the king, and where he still holds his court. The abovementioned provinces were subdivided into districts, known in Ceylon by the name of corles, which subdivisions were continued in the districts wrested from the natives by the Dutch.\n\nThe great divisions of the island are now reduced to two; the one comprehending those parts under the dominion of Europeans, and the other the central country remaining to the natives.\n\nThe internal wealth, as well as population of Ceylon, lies on the west and south-west coasts; while Trincomalee, the secure station for shipping, which renders the island of so much importance to the British nation, lies at the opposite side, and on the most barren quarter of the island. The sea coast, from Manaar to Nigumbo, a distance of 125 miles, presents in general nothing but the most barren and desert appearance, except where it is covered by almost impenetrable jungles. A great variety of curious shells are found along the shores, and some of them very valuable. The mountain, called Hammalcel, or Adam's Peak, is one of the highest in Ceylon, and lies about 60 miles to the north east of Columbo.\n\nThe proper name of this island is Singhala, from which the term Ceylon was probably derived; by the Hindoos, on the continent, it is named Lanka; and, by the Mahommedans, Serendib. It is also frequently named Taprobane; a name which, perhaps, originates from Ta-poo Ravana, or the Island of Ravan,\na mythological sovereign, in times of remote Hindoo antiquity, conquered by the great Rama, King of Oude, as narrated in the Ramayoon.\n\nThe first meridian of the Hindoos passes through the city of Gojain, in the province of Malwah, of which we know the position; but as Lanea (which signifies the equinoctial point) falls therefore to the west of Ceylon, the Indians believe that the island had formerly a much larger extent; and appearances between Ceylon and the Maldives Islands, in some degree, justify that belief. The River Mavaligouga has probably taken its origin from Bali, a hero famous in Hindoo romance; from whom, also, the town of Mavalipuram, on the Coromandel coast, derives its appellation.\n\nThe soil of Ceylon is, in general, sandy, with but a small mixture of clay. In the south-west parts, particularly about Columbo, there is a great deal of marshy land, very rich and productive. This tract is chiefly occupied with cinnamon plantations; and the islaad, taken altogether, does not produce rice sufficient for the inhabitants\u2014yearly supplies from Bengal and other parts being required.\n\nThe seeds of all European plants degenerate very much in this climate in a few years, and soon yield but an indifferent produce. To preserve the quality it is absolutely necessary to have a fresh importation of seeds nearly every year from their natural climates. The agriculture of the Ceylonese is still in its rudest state. Their soil, when it can be watered, yields them a sufficient quantity of rice to maintain their existence; and this seems to be as much as they desire. Their plough consists of a crooked piece of wood, shod with iron, which tears rather than ploughs up the ground. After the first ploughing, the fields are flooded, and then ploughed anew; and weeds are extirpated with great care. When the ploughing season arrives, each village makes it a common concern, and every one attends with his plough and oxen, until the whole of the fields belonging to the society are finished; and the same method is followed in reaping the grain, after which oxen are employed to tread it out.\n\nThe extreme indolence of the Ceylonese makes them employ every expedient to escape from labour; and the small quantity of food which is necessary for the support of their existence enables them, throughout the greater part of the year, to live without doing any thing.\n\nCeylon possesses a great variety of animals, at the head of which must be placed the elephant. In 1797, 176 of these animals were caught on account of government, and sent over for sale to the continent. The superiority of the Ceylon elephants does not consist in their size, for they are in general not so tall as those of the continent, but in their hardiness and strength, and in their great docility and freedom from vice and passion. The natives of Ceylon are so possessed with the idea of the excellence of their own elephants, as to affirm, that the elephants of all the other parts of the world make a salaam (obeisance) before those of Ceylon, and thus instinctively acknowledge their superiority.\n\nCeylon produces but few animals for domestic purposes, such as the horse, the latter being bred in the small islands in the Jaffnapatnam district. The oxen of Ceylon are remarkably small; the beef, however, is sometimes good, and is the chief food of the European soldiers stationed on the island. Buffaloes are frequently employed in drawing burdens, and are found in great numbers on the island, both wild and tame. Among the wild animals are deer, elks, gazelles, hares, wild hogs, and a small species of tiger. The larger kind, called the royal tiger, is not an inhabitant of Ceylon; but there are tiger-eats and leopards. There are no foxes; but jackals, hyenas, and bears, are numerous,\nbesides an infinite variety of the monkey tribe.\n\nAll the European domestic poultry are natives of Ceylon, as are also pheasants, parrots, and parroquets, both wild and tame. Snipes, floricans, storks, cranes, herons, waterfowl of all descriptions, pigeons, wild and domesticated, and a few partridges of the red-legged kind. Among the variety of birds is the honey-bird, which points out where the bees have deposited their combs. Crows here, as in every other part of India, are exceedingly impudent and abundant. There are also taylor-birds, two species of fly-catchers, and peacocks, wild and tame\u2014also the common fowl in a wild state.\n\nThe reptiles of Ceylon are exceedingly numerous; serpents in particular abound, and are a great annoyance to the inhabitants. Covra capellas, or hooded snakes, covra manillas, whip and grass snakes, are all poisonous; the three last are of a very small size. Water and wood snakes are harmless. The rock snake is an immense animal, extending 30 feet in length; but, though formidable from their size, they are perfectly free from poison. They destroy some of the smaller animals, such as kids, goats, and poultry; but the stories of their devouring larger animals, such as tigers and buffaloes, are altogether fabulous. Alligators, of a prodigious size, infest the rivers of Ceylon, and have been killed 20 feet long, and as thick as the body of a horse. There are guanas, toads, lizards, blood-suckers, camelions, and leeches; as also flying lizards, and every species of tropical insect. Fish are found in great abundance in the lakes and rivers of Ceylon, as well as in the surrounding seas.\n\nCeylon is very prolific in plants. Among the fruits are apples, oranges, pomegranates, citrons, lemons, watermelons, pumpkins, melons, squashes, figs, almonds, mulberries, bilberries, mangoes, shaddock, mangosteens, rose apples, cushoo apples and nuts, custard apples, plaintains, jack fruit (a species of the bread-fruit), cocoanuts, and several sorts of pepper, cardamoms, coffee and sugar tree, (a species of palm). The tea plant has also been discovered a native in the forests of the island. Of trees, Ceylon contains the banyan, cotton tree, nando wood, satin wood, calamander wood, and ebony.\n\nAs the food of the natives consists chiefly of rice, so their greatest labour is employed in its cultivation. They usually sow in July and August, and reap in February. When proper advantage is taken of the monsoon, they may have two crops per annum.\n\nThe principal cinnamon woods, or gardeus, lie in the neighbourhood of Columbo. The grand garden, near the town, occupies a tract of country from 10 to 15 miles in length, stretching along from the east to the south of the district. The best soil for the growth of cinnamon is a loose white sand. Of late years little is brought from the interior, it being coarser and thicker in appearance, and of a hot, pungent taste. The prime sort, and that which grows in the gardens round Columbo, is procured from the laurus cinnamomum, a tree of small size, from four to 10 feet in height; the trunk is slender, and a number of branches and twigs shoot out from it on every side. The wood is soft, light, and porous, in appearance much resembling that of the osier, and when barked is chiefly used for fuel. The leaf resembles that of the laurel in shape, but is not of so deep a green. On its first appearance it is of a scarlet red, but after some time it changes gradually to a green, and when chewed has the taste and smell of cloves. The blossom is white, and when in full bloom seems to cover the woods. In passing through the woods little scent is perceived, except by pulling off some of the leaves or branches. The flower has even less scent than the leaves or a bit of twig. The cinnamon tree produces a species of\nfruit resembling an aeorn, but not so large, which is gathered by the natives for the purpose of extracting oil.\n\nThere are several different sorts of cinnamon trees on the island, but four sorts only are barked\u2014all species of the laurus cinnamomum. The honey cinnamon is reckoned the first quality, next the snake cinnamon, then the camphor cinnamon, (the root of which yields camphor by distillation); and, lastly, an astringent species of cinnamon, harsh to the taste, named the cabatti curunder. These are the only sorts barked on account of government.\n\nUntil this island was possessed by the Dutch cinnamon grew entirely in a wild state; experience afterwards proved that the cultivated cinnamon was, in every respect, equal to the wild. The Dutch governor, T'alk, first attempted to rear cinnamon trees, by art, in his garden near Columbo.\n\nThere are two different seasons in which cinnamon is barked. The greater part is prepared during the grand harvest, which lasts from April to August: the little harvest occupies little more than a month, from November to January. Each district, where the cinnamon tree grows, is obliged to furnish a certain quantity, proportioned to the number of villages and inhabitants they contain. Branches of three years old are lopped off for barking; the outside thin coat is scraped off, and the bark is loosened, so as to come off in the shape of tubes, the smaller of which are inserted in the larger, and spread out to dry. The bundles, 30 pounds each, are then made up, and carried to the store-houses to examine and have its quality fixed. This disagreeable task is imposed on the Company's surgeons, who ascertain it by chewing a few sticks of each bundle, the repetition of which operation excoriates the tongue and inside of the mouth, and renders it impossible for them to continue the process above two or three days successively.\n\nThe best cinnamon is rather pliable, and ought not much to exceed in thickness stout writing-paper; it is of a light yellowish colour, has a sweet taste, not so hot as to occasion pain, and not succeeded by an aftertaste. The inferior kind is distinguished by being thicker, of a darker and browner colour, hot and pungent when chewed, and succeeded by a disagreeable after-taste. In stowing the bales of cinnamon on board ship black pepper is sprinkled among them, so as to fill up all the interstices; and, by this means, both spices are preserved and improved. From the refuse cinnamon an oil was extracted by the Dutch, a pint of which was valued at 10l. sterling; but this manufacture was not thought worth continuing after the island came into the possession of the British. The cinnamon tree has been tried on the coast of Malabar, at Batavia, and the Isle of France; but it has invariably degenerated. Even in Ceylon it is only found in perfection on the western coast.\n\nThe minerals of Ceylon are numerous, and precious stones are particularly abundant, but not of a fine quality. The ruby, the topaz, and the diamond of Ceylon are very inferior to those of Golconda, or of the Brazils. Besides these, amethysts, tourmalins, (destitute of electric qualities) blue and green sapphires, white and black crystal, the cat's eye, a species of opal, and cornelians, are found in Ceylon. Lead, tin, and iron ore are found in the interior, but they are never wrought or applied to any purpose. There were formerly several mines of quicksilver wrought by the Dutch in Ceylon. In 1797 a small one was discovered at Cotta, six miles from Columbo, from which six pounds was procured at a most seasonable period for the garrison. This mine has never since been worked with much activity, the produce not reimbursing the expenditure.\n\nThe Ceylonese, under the British dominion, are governed by their own\nnative magistrates, under the control of the administration. All the possessions are divided into corles and districts, the subordinate superintendence of which is given to the moodeliers, or native magistrates, who are chosen from among the class of nobles, styled Hondrews and Mahondrews. The moodeliers assist in collecting the revenue, settling the proportion of taxes and contributions, superintending the peasants, furnishing provisions for the garrisons, and observing generally the conduct of the natives. In some districts there is a police corps to assist in enforcing the orders of government. The moodeliers send reports to the Maha moodelfer, the chief of the whole order, who resides in the black town of Columbo, and lays these reports before the governor. There are particular moodeliers to superintend the barking of the cinnamon, and interfere in nothing else. The class of moodeliers are of infinite use in preserving the obedience of the natives, and appears to be very much attached to the British government, which patronizes them. The Dutch usually maintained a military force of 3000 Europeans, and 2000 Topasses and Malays, which was not found sufficient. In 1777, while the Dutch had the island, there was a great deficiency in the revenue; and in 1795 it only amounted to 611,704 livres. The deficiency was made up by the valuable cargoes sent from the island.\n\nBesides the native Cingalese, who live under the dominion of the Europeans, the sea coasts are inhabited by Dutch, Portuguese, Malays, and settlers from the different Indian nations. The Dutch have adopted many of the native habits; and the chief original trait of the Batavian character, which they retain uninjured, is an attachment to gin and tobacco; in other respects they have adopted the customs and listless manners of the country. In their salutations they are very ceremonious, and make a profusion of bows. On their tables they have very gross and heavy food, having a great quantity of butter and oil mixed with their fish and other meat. Conversation with females forms very little part of a Ceylonese Dutchman's entertainment. These females, who have a mixture of native blood, are easily distinguished by a tinge on the colour of their skin, and their thick strong black hair; marks which are not to be removed in the course of many generations. Dancing is the principal amusement of the younger women; while the chief pleasure of the elderly married ladies consists in paying formal and ceremonious visits to each other.\n\nThe present Portuguese of Ceylon are the spurious descendants of the several European possessors of the island by native women, joined to a number of Moors and Malabars. A colour more approaching to black than white, with a particular mode of dress, half Indian and half European, is all that is necessary to procure the appellation of a Portuguese. Although they universally profess the Christian religion, and are commonly Roman Catholics, yet they retain many pagan customs, and their religion may be considered as a compound of both. Some of the females are pretty, with fine figures. The men are about middle size, slender, lank, and ill made, so as easily to be distinguished; and from this class the Topass soldiers were taken. They were never accounted good troops, being neither so brave nor so hardy as the sepoys, and have been seldom employed in the English service. The French, however, very generally had corps of them at Pondicherry and their other settlements.\n\nThe Malays are another race, who form a considerable proportion of the inhabitants of Ceylon. They universally profess the Mahommedan religion; although, as to some inferior points and duties, they differ among themselves. The Dutch government at Ceylon had always a regiment of Malays in their service,\nwhich has now been transferred to the British. They are armed and clothed in the same manner as Europeans, except that they wear sandals instead of shoes.\n\nThe far greater proportion of the inhabitants consist of native Ceylonese, who have submitted to the European domination, and retain their original appellation of Cingalese; while those who live in the country, under the authority of the native princes, are distinguished by the name of Candian. The Ceylonese are of a middling stature, about five feet eight inches, and fairer in complexion than the Moors and Malabars of the continent; they are, however, neither so well made, nor so strong. The Candians are fairer and better made, and less effeminate than the Cingalese. In their diet the latter are very abstemious, fruits and rice constituting the principal part of their food; but in places where fish are plenty, they also compose part of their meals. Flesh is scarcely anywhere in constant use.\n\nIn Ceylon the distinction of ranks among the natives is kept up with the most scrupulous exactness. The Candians are not allowed to whiten their houses, nor cover them with tiles, these being royal privileges. Their villages and towns, in place of presenting the compact appearance to which Europeans are accustomed, look like a number of distinct houses scattered at random, in the midst of a thick wood or forest.\n\nAll ranks universally chew betel leaf, with which they mix tobacco, areka nut, and the lime of burnt shells, to render it more pungent. The females among the Cingalese are said to be treated with considerable attention. There is no positive regulation regarding marriage, many men having but one wife, while others have as many as they can maintain. The marriage ceremony is attended to only with a view to entitle the parties to share in each other's goods; and to give their relations an opportunity of observing, that they have married into their own caste. Gravity, that invariable characteristic of the savage state, still continues among the Cingalese, in a much greater degree than might be expected from the stage of their civilization.\n\nIt does not appear that before the arrival of the Europeans the Cingalese had any sort of dial; they measured time by a vessel with a hole in the bottom, which let out the water in one hour, according to their division of time. The learning of the Ceylonese, consists chiefly in some pretended skill in astrology. Among the Candians there are a sect of learned men named Gonies, retained by the king to execute all the writings of the state, and those which regard religious affairs. On which occasions, they employ the Arabic character. About Jaffnapatnam, on account of its proximity to the continent, the Tamil is the principal language. The Cingalese are expert and ingenious artificers, and display particular dexterity in gold, silver, and carpenters work.\n\nThe most singular part of the inhabitants of Ceylon are the Bedahs or Vaddahs, who inhabit the distant recesses of the forest. Their origin has never been traced, and they appear to differ very much from the other inhabitants of Ceylon. They are scattered over the woods in different parts of the island, but are most numerous in the province of Bintau, which lies to the north east of Candy, in the direction of Trincomalee and Batacole, and are there more completely in the savage state, than anywhere else. They subsist by hunting deer and other animals of the forest, and on the fruits which grow spontaneously around them; but they never cultivate the ground in any manner. They sleep on trees or at the foot of them, and climb up like monkeys when alarmed. A few of the less wild traffic with the natives, giving ivory, honey, wax, and\ndeer, in exchange for cloth, iron, and knives; but the wilder class, known by the name of Rambah Vedahs, are more seldom seen, even by stealth, than the most timid of the wild animals. The dogs of the Vedahs constitute their only riches, and are described as possessing wonderful sagacity.\n\nThe Birmans of Ava acknowledge the superior antiquity of the Cingalese, and the reception of their laws and religion from that quarter. The King of Ava has within the last 30 years, at separate times, sent two messengers, persons of learning and respectability to Ceylon, to procure the original books on which their tenets are founded. In one instance, the Birman minister made official application to the Governor General of India, to protect and assist the person charged with the commission. A great majority of the Candians still remain of the Buddhist sect. On the sea coast, among the European settlements, it is supposed the number of natives possessing Christianity amounts to nearly half a million. Of these, part are Roman Catholics, while others attend the Calvinistic and Lutheran worship. In the interior of Ceylon, the ruins of the pagodas and temples are mostly of hewn stone, and of much superior workmanship to those of the lower part of the country.\n\nPrior to the arrival of the Portuguese, which happened in 1505, little is known of the history of Ceylon, and that little mostly fabulous. The strange mythological poem, named the Ramayon, narrates the conquest of this Island by Rama, King of Oude, assisted by an army of gigantic monkies; which appears to indicate a sort of connexion betwixt the north of India and this island, that could not have been expected in such remote times. When the Portuguese Commander Almeida arrived, he persuaded the sovereign of Ceylon to pay him tribute, on condition of assisting him against the Arabs\u2014so early do foreigners appear to have infested the natives of this island.\n\nAt that period the inhabitants consisted of two distinct races; the savage Bedahs, then, as now, occupied the forests, particularly in the northern parts; the rest of the country was in possession of the Cingalese, whose most powerful chief held his court at Columbo. The first tribute paid to the Portuguese was 250,000 pounds of cinnamon, but their bigotry and avarice involved them in incessant wars with the Cingalese. In 1603 the Dutch appeared, who were ultimately destined to wrest the possessions from the Portuguese, and oppress the natives with a still heavier yoke. In 1632 they sent a strong armament to act in concert with the King of Candy against the Portuguese, whom in 1656 they completely subdued, after a long and bloody struggle. In this year Columbo surrendered, after a siege of seven months.\n\nFrom this time began a new series of wars betwixt the Candian sovereigns and the Dutch, in which the former was twice driven from Candy, his capital, and forced to seek refuge in the mountains of Digliggy, the highest and most impenetrable in the kingdom. The difficulties of the interior, however, were such, that the Dutch never could retain permanent possession of any conquests remote from the sea coast. In addition to the obstacles presented by the nature of the country, the Dutch troops suffered dreadfully from the effects of the climate. The last great war carried on with the natives was in 1764, when they penetrated into the heart of the king's dominions, and took Candy. They were, however, at length compelled to retreat, and had 400 of their best soldiers made prisoners, who were put to death at Cuddavilli and Sittivacca, only two days march from Columbo. By perseverance and the power they possessed of withholding a supply of salt, they compelled the king to a\npeace in 1766, by which he gave up all his remaining possessions on the sea coast, and remained enclosed in the remainder, for which he paid tribute in the productions of the country. In return for these valuable acquisitions, the Dutch acknowledged the Candian sovereign as Emperor of Ceylon, to which they added a number of other magnificent appellations. Tranquillity, however, was not secured by this treaty, as the Candians often endeavoured by force of arms to procure better terms. Such was the state of affairs between the Dutch and Candians towards the commencement of the war in 1793.\n\nIn January, 1782, the British forces captured Trincomalee after a very slight resistance; but it was shortly after with equal ease retaken by the French fleet, commanded by M. Suffrein. Ceylon continued in the possession of the Dutch until 1796, when it was conquered by the British, and finally ceded at the peace of Amiens. In 1802 it was constituted a royal government, immediately under the direction of the crown, which appoints the officers, and regulates the internal management. The council is composed of the governor, chief justice, the commander of the forces, and the secretary. The revenues of all sorts amounts to about 230,000l. per annum, which sum comprehends 60,000l. per annum paid by the East India Company for cinnamon, and 40,000l. the average produce of the fisheries. (Percival, Knox, Symes, C. Buchanan, Jones &c.)\n\nChacky, (Chahi).\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, district of Monghir, 102 miles S. E. by S. from Patna. Lat. 24\u00b0. 33\u2032. N. Long. 86\u00b0. 25\u2032. E.\n\nChamparum.\u2014See Bettiah.\n\nChandail, (Chandala).\u2014A town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Malwah, 110 miles N. E. from Oojain. Lat. 23\u00b0. 43\u2032. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 22\u2032. E.\n\nChagaing.\u2014A large fortified town in the Birman empire, situated on the west bank of the Irawaddy, opposite to the city of Ava. Lat. 21\u00b0. 54\u2032. N. Long. 96\u00b0. E. This is the principal emporium to which cotton is brought from all parts of the country; and where, after being cleaned, it is embarked for the China market. It is sent from hence by the Irawaddy in boats, which carry about 36,000 pounds; the voyage to Quantong, on the frontiers of the province of Yunnan in China, occupying from 30 to 40 days. In the latter part of the journey the passage is difficult and dangerous, owing to the increased rapidity of the stream over a rocky channel. At Chagaing females perform the office of cleaning the cotton from the seeds, which is effected by double cylinders turned by a lathe. She turns the machine with her foot, while she supplies the cotton with her hands.\n\nNamdojee Praw, the second monarch of the reigning family, removed the seat of the government from Monchaboo to Chagaing, on account of the purity of the air, and the beauty of the scenery around it. This town is a great place of religious resort, on account of the number of praws or temples erected in the neighbourhood. It is also the principal manufactory of idols, which, hewn out of an adjacent quarry of fine alabaster, are sculptured here, and are afterwards transported to the remotest corners of the Birman empire.\n\nNear to Chagaing is a town named Kycock Zeit, remarkable for being the great manufactory of marble idols, the inhabitants of which are statuaries. Here are 30 or 40 large yards crowded with artists at work, on images of various sizes; but all of the same personage, Gaudma, sitting cross legged on a pedestal. The largest a little exceeds the human size, and the cost is 12 or 13l. but some diminutive Gaudmas may be had for six or seven shillings. The workmen do not part with their sacred commodity to any but Birmans.\nIn this neighbourhood also is a manufactory of rockets, of a most enormous size. The tubes are the trunks of trees, bored like a pump, in some the cavity of the cylinder is nine or 10 inches in diameter, and the wood about two inches thick; the length varies from 12 to 20 feet. These tubes are filled with a composition of charcoal, saltpetre, and gunpowder, rammed very hard; and the large ones are discharged from a high scaffold, erected on purpose. Bamboos, fastened together, of a length adapted to preserve the poise from the tail of the rocket. In this branch of pyrotechny the Birmans take great delight, and are particularly skilful. (Synes, Cox, &c.)\n\nChalawar, (Jhalawar).\u2014A district in the province of Gujrat, which occupies a considerable tract of country between the Gnilfs of Cambay and Cutch, and situated principally between the 21st and 22d degrees of north latitude. The districts of Werrear, Putwar (Pattau), and Chuwal, are all properly included in Chalawara. By Abul Fazel in 1582 it is described as follows:\n\n\"Chalawareh was formerly an independent country, but is now subject to the governor of Gujrat, and inhabited by the tribe Chalah.\"\n\nThe original seat of the Jhalawar authority was at Dhaina, now a small village between Adrianna and Jhingwara. At a very early period the family of Drangdra, from whom the Jhala chieftains are sprung, resided at Dhama, of which no ruins remain to indicate its former grandeur.\n\nThe Rajpoots of this part of Gujrat are divided into three classes, the Jeenamas, the Kuraria, and the Naroda. The first are respectable, and addressed with the title of Jee; the second have resigned some part of their rank, and perform menial offices; the last have wholly relinquished their military character, cultivate the land, and are now degraded to the rank of Koonbees. All these classes have an insurmountable objection to the flesh of a black goat, which they consider unwholesome.\n\nA great proportion of this district is but thinly inhabited, and remains still in a state of nature, although some appearances authorize the supposition, that it formerly enjoyed a greater state of prosperity. It is now laid waste by the predatory hostilities of the tribes that occupy it; and, although the Guicowar claims a dominion over the whole, his authority is but little attended to. It contains no towns or rivers of magnitude, and the face of the country is hilly and irregular. (McMurdo, Abul Fazel, &c.)\n\nChalo.\u2014A village in Tibet, situated midway between two lakes. Lat. 28\u00b0. 18'. N. Long. 89\u00b0. 15'. E. These lakes are frequented by great abundance of water fowl, wild geese, ducks, teal, and storks, which, on the approach of winter, take their flight to milder regions. Prodigious numbers of saurasses, the largest of the crane kind, are seen here at certain seasons of the year, and great quantities of their eggs are collected on the banks. This vicinity produces a dwarfish wheat of the lammas kind.\n\nOne of the lakes is held in high respect by the inhabitants of Bootan, who fancy it a favourite haunt of their chief deities. To the north of these lakes there is a plain, impregnated with a saline substance resembling natron, and called by the natives of Hindostan, where it is also found in great abundance, sed-jy-mutti. (Turner, &c.)\n\nChambah, (Champa).\u2014An extensive mountainous district in the province of Lahore, situated about the 33d degree of north latitude. It is intersected by the Ravey River, and bounded on the east by the Beyah. It is now possessed by the Seiks and their tributaries.\n\nChambah.\u2014A town in the Seik territories, in the province of Lahore, 110 miles N. E. from the city of Lahore. Lat. 32\u00b0. 28'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 33'. E.\nCHANDAH, (Chandra, the Moon).\u2014A town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Khandesh, situated on the south side of the Purnah River, near its junction with the Tupatee, 20 miles S.S.E. from Boorhanpoor. Lat. 21\u00b0. 5'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 9'. E.\n\nCHANDAH.\u2014A town in the province of Berar, 87 miles S. from Nagpoor, the capital of a district of the same name, and at present possessed by the Nagpoor rajah. Lat. 20\u00b0. 3'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 54'. E.\n\nCHANDAH.\u2014A large district in the province of Gundwana, subject to the Nagpoor Maharattas, situated principally between the 20th and 21st degrees of north latitude. Compared with the Goand Hills to the north this is a champaign country, the soil of which is sandy. The produce is chiefly rice, with small quantities of pulse and sugar cane. The inhabitants possess numerous herds of goats and sheep. There is a very perceptible difference betwixt the climate of this plain country and that of the Goand Mountains. From the Chandah district cotton is exported to the Northern Circars. During the reign of Aurengezebe this division of Gundwanah was annexed to the soubah of Berar, although but very imperfectly subdued. (Blunt, J. Grant, &c.)\n\nCHANDAH.\u2014A village in the province of Khandesh, 33 miles S.W. from Boorhanpoor. Lat. 21\u00b0. 5'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 10'. E. Near to this place the Tupatee and Purnah rivers unite their streams, which confluence, held sacred by the Hindoos, is by them called Jeggur Tirut, or the river of adored places. (Abul Fazel, &c.)\n\nCHANDAHNEE, (or Chumanah).\u2014A small district in the province of Lahore, situated betwixt the 33d and 34th degrees of north latitude. In the vicinity of Nagrolah commence the districts of the Chandahnee chief, a dependent on Jamboe, who, in 1783, possessed a revenue of about a lack of rupees per annum. This chief does not remit any revenue, but assists his superior with a quota of troops. At Dumanunjee, in this district, is an uncommonly beautiful and fertile valley. (Forster, &c.)\n\nCHANDAHNEE, (or Chumanah).\u2014A town in the Seik territories, in the province of Lahore, 122 miles N. by E. from the city of Lahore. Lat. 38\u00b0. 24'. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 41'. E. This is a neat and populous town, situated on the brow of a hill, at the foot of which, on the eastern side, runs a rapid stream, passing to the left. This channel is passed on two stout fir beams, one of which reaches from the shore to an insulated rock in the centre of the river, to which it is fastened by wooden stakes, while the other extends from the rock to the opposite bank. (Foster, &c.)\n\nCHANDERNAGORE.\u2014A French settlement in Bengal, situated on the west bank of the River Hooghly, about 20 miles above Calcutta. Lat. 22\u00b0. 49'. N. Long. 88\u00b0. 26'. E.\n\nThe position of this town is, in every respect, better than that of Calcutta; and the territory originally attached to it extended two miles along the river, and one inland.\n\nOn the 23d March, 1757, it was taken by the forces under Admiral Watson and Colonel Clive, after a most obstinate resistance, and with great slaughter on board the ships engaged. It has since remained unfortified, and has been taken possession of by the British government, without opposition, on the commencement of hostilities with France. (Ives, Rennel, &c.)\n\nCHANDRAGIRI, (the Mountain of the Moon).\u2014A large square fort in the province of South Canara, 13 miles south from Mangalore, situated on the south side of a river of the same name, which is the northern boundary of Malayala, or Malabar. Lat. 12\u00b0. 27'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 8'. E.\n\nThis place was built by Siruppa Nayaka, the first prince of the house of Ikeri, who established his authority in this part of Canara. At low water the river is shallow, but very wide; the country on its north side\nis called by the Hindoos Tulava. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nChandragupti.\u2014A small town, containing about 100 houses, in the north-western extremity of the Mysore country, named also Gufi. Lat. 14\u00b0 23'. N. Long. 75\u00b0 8'. E.\n\nThree miles to the north of Chandragupti is a hill producing iron ore, which is found in veins intermixed with laterite, and in this district there is also some sandal wood of a good quality. In the surrounding country the village god is Nandi, or the bull on which Siva rides. He is also called Baswa, and receives no sacrifices which are held in abhorrence by the Sivabhaetar chiefs, or adherents of Mahadeva, or Siva. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nChandere, (Chandri).\u2014A town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Aurungabad, 130 miles N. N. E. from Poona. Lat. 20\u00b0 18'. N. Long. 74\u00b0 36'. E.\n\nChandgherry.\u2014A town in the Carnatic, the capital of a small district of the same name, 72 miles W. N. W. from Madras. Lat. 13\u00b0 33'. N. Long. 79\u00b0 25'. E. This was the site of the Hindoo kingdom, known by the appellation of Narasinga, which, in 1599, comprehended Tanjore and Madura. In 1640 the English were permitted by one of these princes to settle at Madras.\n\nIn 1640 the Mahommedan states of Golconda and Bejapoor possessed themselves of this place, and also of Vellore. The citadel of Chandgherry is built on the summit of a stupendous rock, with a fortified town at its foot. (Reenel, Willis, &c.)\n\nChandgerry.\u2014A town in the province of Gundwana, with a fort and large tank, and containing a considerable population. (Leckie, &c.)\n\nChandgherry, (Chandragheri).\u2014A hill fort in the Mysore province, district of Chitteldroog, 108 miles N. N. W. from Seringapatam. Lat. 13\u00b0 47'. N. Long. 76\u00b0 5'. E. The hill on which this fort is built is not high; nor, including the Pettah at its base, more than three miles in circumference, and, though fortified, is not a place of strength. The hills in this neighbourhood abound with iron ore. (Moor, &c.)\n\nChandpoor, (Chandrapura).\u2014A town in the British territories, in the province of Delhi, 70 miles N. E. from Delhi. Lat. 29\u00b0 9'. N. Long. 78\u00b0 14'. E.\n\nChandroo.\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Tipperah, situated on the east side of the great River Megna, 33 miles S. S. E. from Dacca. Lat. 23\u00b0 17'. N. Long. 90\u00b0 31'. E. This place is celebrated for the excellence of its oranges, which are, probably, the best in India. They are of a particular sort, the skin being very thick, and almost separated from the interior pulp.\n\nChandree.\u2014A district in the province of Malwah, situated about the 25th degree of north latitude, and intersected by the River Sinde. In 1582 it was described by Abul Fazel as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Chendary, containing 61 mahals, measurement 554,277 begahs, revenue 31,037,788 dams. Seyurghal 26,931 dams. This sircar furnishes 5970 cavalry, 90 elephants, and 60,685 infantry.\"\n\nAlthough mountainous this district is fertile, and tolerably well cultivated. The principal towns are Seronge, Chanderee, and Chandery. In 1790 Ram Chund, the Rajah of Chanderee, lived in retirement at Oude, and left his district under the administration of his son, who paid tribute to the Maharattas. (Abul Fazel, Hunter, &c.)\n\nChandree.\u2014A town in the province of Malwah, situated on the west side of the River Betwah, 90 miles W. by S. from Chatterpoor. Lat. 24\u00b0 50'. N. Long. 78\u00b0 25'. E. This is a very ancient town, and described by Abul Fazel as containing 14,000 stone houses, but like other Hindostany cities is much decayed.\n\nChang.\u2014A large province in Tibet, extending along the north side\nof the Himalaya Mountains, and situated betwixt the 28th and 30th degrees of north latitude. It is intersected by the great River Brahmapootra, in this part of its course named the Sanpoo; but we have no further authentic information respecting this remote region.\n\nChaprough.\u2014A town in the Nahry Sangkar province, situated to the north of the Himalaya Mountains, the northern boundary of Hindostan. Lat. 33\u00b0. 20'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 36'. E.\n\nCharwah, (Chorwa).\u2014A town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Khandesh, 75 miles N. N. E. from Boorhanpoor. Lat. 22\u00b0. 10'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 4'. E. At this place there is a fort of four bastions. From hence, four miles beyond the Baum River, there is scarcely any signs of inhabitants. (12th Register, &c.)\n\nChassircong.\u2014A town in the Nahry Sangkar province, situated to the north of the Himalaya Mountains. Lat. 33\u00b0. 30'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 36'. E.\n\nChatterpoor, (Chattrapwa).\u2014A city in the province of Allahabad, district of Bundelcund. Lat. 24\u00b0. 57'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 53'. E.\n\nThis town (situated below the Ghauts) was founded by Rajah Chuttersal, and occasionally his residence, which rendered it flourishing and an important commercial mart, being a sort of entrepot for the trade carried between Mirzapoor and the Deccan. From this city, and from the diamond mines of Pannah, almost the whole of the sayer duties were levied, as there was then no other town of commercial importance in Bundelcund. These duties in the town of Chatterpoor alone are said to have amounted to above four lacks of rupees per annum.\n\nThis place is extensive, and well built, the houses being mostly of stone, but compared with its former flourishing condition it is now desolate. When Bundeleand was ceded to the British, this town, with a great portion of the surrounding territory, was occupied by Kooar Loni Sah, one of the innumerable petty chiefs of that distracted province.\n\nTravelling distance from Agra 212 miles, from Benares 237, from Nagpoor 302, from Oojain 320, from Calcutta 698, and from Bombay 747 miles. (MSS. Ironside, Rennel, &c.)\n\nChattoor.\u2014A town in the province of Tinnevelly, 25 miles S. W. from Madura. Lat. 9\u00b0. 40'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 55'. E.\n\nChatzan.\u2014A town in the territories of the Afghan Balloochies, situated west of the Indus, in the province of Sewee. Lat. 31\u00b0. 8'. N. Long. 69\u00b0. 43'. E.\n\nCheduba.\u2014An island in the Bay of Bengal, lying off the coast of Arracan, from which it is distant about 10 miles, and, with the rest of that province, subject to the Birman government. It is the most westerly of a cluster of islands, and is of a moderate height, with several hammocks on it. Both Cheduba, and the more eastern islands are inhabited, and produce such quantities of grain, that ships of any burthen may load that article here. The channel between this island and the main is annually navigated by large trading boats, but it does not afford a safe passage for large shipping. It is governed by a chekey, or lieutenant, deputed by the Birman viceroy of Aracan. (Symes, Elmore, &c.)\n\nCheesapany.\u2014A town and small fort in the Nepaul territories. Lat. 27\u00b0. 23'. N. Long. 85\u00b0. 30'. E. The perpendicular height of this fort above Bheemp'hide is about 530 yards, and it possesses no other strength than what is derived from its situation, it being only capable of containing 100 men. This fort is not commanded by an omrah, as almost all the fortresses in the Nepaul territory are, but by an officer immediately nominated by the soubah. The omrahs in the Nepaul dominions are independent of the civil governors, and their forces are chiefly composed of troops raised and formed by themselves. Their arms con-\nslist of matchlocks, broad swords, and bows and arrows.\n\nCheesapany is a custom-house station, and the only one besides Scedli, at which duties are collected on merchandise passing from the Company's and vizier's territories. The village adjoining to the fort contains about 20 houses. There is a little grain raised, but not enough for the consumption of even the few inhabitants of the place. From the fort, or village, is a tolerable easy ascent of about three-quarters of a mile by the road to Cheesapany, or cold water spring. About 120 yards higher than Cheesapany Fort, the mountains of Himalaya are seen rearing their lofty peaks, eternally covered with snow. (Kirkpatrick, &c.)\n\nChekwall.\u2014A town in the Seik territories, in the province of Lahore, situated 107 miles N.W. from the city of Lahore. Lat. 32\u00b0. 39'. N. Long. 72\u00b0. 16'. E. About 10 miles to the north of this place are hills which produce salt, alum, and sulphur, and near to them are salt and hot wells.\n\nCheraghaut Hills.\u2014A range of hills in the Nepaul territories, situated about the 27th degree of north latitude, which, according to the indication of the barometer, do not appear to exceed 480 yards above the level of the district of Hajypoor in Bengal. (Kirkpatrick, &c.)\n\nCheridon.\u2014See Sheribon.\n\nChiaw Bay.\u2014A deep bay in the north-east side of the Island of Gilo, which abounds with shoals and shallows, and into which the monsoon perpetually blows, backed by strong currents.\n\nChica Nayakana Hully.\u2014A large square town in the Mysore province, strongly fortified with mud walls, and having cavaliers at the angles; and in the centre is a square citadel, fortified in the same manner. The houses are above 600, and of a mean and ruinous appearance. It possesses a small manufacture of coarse cotton cloth, both white and coloured. The name signifies the town of the little chief, which was the name assumed by the polygars of Hagalwadi, who fortified it about 300 years ago. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nChilka Cavil.\u2014A small town in the district of North Coimbetoor, situated at the bottom of the Ghauts. Lat. 11\u00b0. 51'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 48'. E. Inhabitants of this neighbourhood are a mixture of those who speak the Karnata, and of those who speak the Telungana languages.\n\nChickacole.\u2014See Cicacole.\n\nChichacotta, (Chichacota).\u2014A town in Northern Hindostan, in the province of Bootan, not far from the Cooch Bahar in Bengal. Lat. 26\u00b0. 32'. N. Long. 89\u00b0. 25'. E.\n\nThis place was taken from the Bootees in 1772, when it was defended by them with great obstinacy, and much personal courage. With matchlocks, sabres, and bows, it was impossible they could long contend against firelocks and cannon. It was restored at the conclusion of the war, and now constitutes the Bootan frontier towards Bengal. (Turner, &c.)\n\nChienpoor, (Chinapur).\u2014A town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Khandesh, 53 miles N.N.E. from Boorhanpoor. Lat. 21\u00b0. 57'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 13'. E.\n\nChickoory, (Chicuri).\u2014A town in the territories of the Poonah Maharattas, situated 45 miles S.S.W. from Merritch. Lat. 16\u00b0. 23'. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 50'. E.\n\nThis is a large and respectable town, with an extensive bazar. It is pleasantly situated near a rivulet, and has a manufactory of cloth, chiefly for the dress of the country people. The neighbourhood of this town is famous for producing grapes of an extraordinary size. (Moor, &c.)\n\nChilka Lake.\u2014A lake in the Northern Circars, which province it separates towards the sea from that of Cuttack. In length it may be estimated at 35 miles, by eight the average breadth, is very shallow, and contains several inhabited islands. This lake seems to be the effect of\nthe sea, over a flat sandy shore, the elevation of which was but little above the level of the country within. On the N.W. it is bounded by a ridge of mountains, a continuation of that which extends from the Mahanuddy to the Godavery River, and encloses the Northern Circars towards the continent. The Chilka Lake, therefore, forms a pass on each side into the province of Cuttack, and presents an agreeable diversity of objects\u2014mountains, islands, and forests. At a distance from the land it has the appearance of a deep bay, the slip of land which separates it from the sea not being visible. This space, for several miles along the southern and eastern shore, is about a mile broad, and an entire sand. Near Manickpatam the branch of the Chilka is about three-fourths of a mile broad, and difficult to cross if the wind blows strong. (Rennel, Upton, &c.)\n\nChilmarry, (Chalamari).\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Mymensingh, situated on the west side of the great River Brahmapootra, 130 miles N.by W. from Dacca. Lat. 25\u00b0. 25'. N. Long. 88\u00b0. 42'. E.\n\nChillambaram Pagodas.\u2014These pagodas are situated on the seacoast of the Carnatic, a little to the south of Porto Novo, and 120 miles S.S.W. from Madras. Lat. 11\u00b0. 27'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 52'. E.\n\nThe entry to the Chillambaram Pagoda, held in great veneration on account of its antiquity, is by a stately gate, under a pyramid 122 feet high, built with large stones above 40 feet long, and more than five feet square, and all covered with plates of copper, adorned with a variety of figures neatly executed. The whole structure extends 1332 feet in one direction, and 936 in another. About 1785 this gateway was repaired by a devout widow at the expense of 50,000 pagodas. The whole of the architecture has a more ancient appearance than Tanjore or Ramiscram. (Somerset, Lord Valentia, &c.)\n\nChimneer.\u2014A town in the territories of the Nagpoor Maharattas, situated in the province of Berar, 40 miles S. from Nagpoor. Lat. 20\u00b0. 35'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 54'. E.\n\nChinabalabaram.\u2014A town in the Mysore Rajah's territories, 100 miles N.E. from Seringapatam. Lat. 13\u00b0. 26'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 55'. E. By the natives it is called Chica Balapoor, and Chuta Balapoor by the Mahomedans.\n\nFifty years past it belonged to a polygar named Narayana Swami, who possessed also Doda Balapoor, and had Nundy Droog for his principal stronghold. He was subdued and expelled by Hyder, and the town, after Lord Cornwallis's war in 1792, almost destroyed by Tippoo. The town is now fast recovering, and contains above 400 houses; of which more than one-fourth are occupied by Brahmins, 30 families of whom are of such high rank, that they live entirely on charity. A large proportion of the inhabitants speak, as their native dialect, the Celinga language.\n\nSugar candy is made here equal to that of China, and the clayed sugar is very white and fine; but the art being a secret, it is so dear, that the Chinese sugar candy is sold cheaper at Seringapatam, than this is on the spot where it is produced. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nChinapatam.\u2014A town in the Rajah of Mysore's territories, 40 miles N.E. from Seringapatam. Lat. 12\u00b0. 39'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 24'. E.\n\nThis is an open town, containing about 1000 houses, with a handsome stone fort at a little distance. The country around is very beautiful, consisting of swelling grounds, mixed with fantastic rocks and hills, in some places cultivated, and in others covered with trees, the finest in either of the Carnatics. In sight of Chinapatam is Patala Durga, one of the places to which Tippoo sent the unfortunate wretches who incurred his displeasure, when death soon terminated their sufferings. There\nis here a small manufactory of glass. Another manufacture is steel wires for the strings of musical instruments, which are reckoned the best in India. A family at Chinapatan has the art of making very fine white sugar, which formerly was kept for the sole use of the court at Seringapatam. Such monopolies of good things were favourite practices with the arbitrary governments of Hindostan. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nChinampetta.\u2014A town in the district of Madura, 11 miles S. by W. from the city of Madura. Lat. 9\u00b0. 41'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 8'. E.\n\nChinchew (or Chang) Bay.\u2014A spacious bay and harbour in Cochin China, completely sheltered from all winds, but only accessible for large vessels at high water. Lat. 13\u00b0. 50'. N. At the head of this harbour is situated the city of Quin-nong.\n\nChinchoor.\u2014A small town in the province of Aurungabad, situated on the road from Bombay to Poonah. It is pleasantly placed on the left bank of a river, and is said to contain 5000 inhabitants, including 300 Brahmin families. It has the appearance of an industrious town, the houses being good, the streets clean, and the shops well supplied.\n\nThis place is the residence of Chintamun Deo, whom a great proportion of the Maharatta nation believe to be an incarnation of their favourite deity, Goonputty. The present is the eighth in descent from the first, and they take the name, alternately, of Chintamun Deo and Narrain Deo. The Brahmins relate that each deo at his death has been burned, and invariably a small image of Goonputty has miraculously arisen from the ashes, which is placed in the tomb and worshipped. Although the deo be an incarnation of the deity Goonputty, he performs pooja (worships) his other self, in the form of a statue; for the latter, the Brahmins say, is the greatest, his power not being diminished by the avatar, or incarnation.\n\nThe deo is, ex officio, a dewannah, or fool; but the term fool does not, in this instance, as in most others, give the best translation of the word. He is totally unmindful and ignorant of worldly affairs, unable (the Brahmins say) to hold conversation beyond the proposition, reply, and rejoinder, and then in a childish, blubbering manner. His ordinary occupations do not differ materially from those of other men; he eats, drinks, takes wives to himself, &c., like other Brahmins.\n\nIn 1809, the deo was a boy, 12 years of age. His palace is an enormous pile of building, without any kind of elegance, near the Moorta, on which the town stands. The floors of this edifice are spread over with the sacred cow-dung, and the apartments crowded with sleek, well fed Brahmins. Near the palace are the tombs of the former deos, which are so many small temples enclosed, and planted round with trees, and communicating by steps with the river. Here goes on the business of worship. In one place are seen women pouring oil, water, and milk over the figures of the gods; in another, children decking them with flowers. Here pilgrims and devotees performing their ablutions; and there priests chanting portions of their sacred poems; the whole proceeding with the most listless indolence and apathy. (Lord Valentia, Moor, M. Graham, &c.)\n\nChingleput.\u2014The ancient possession of the Company, in the Carnatic, formerly denominated the Jaghire, now forms the collectorship of Chingleput. It was permanently assessed in 1801-2; but the effect has not been so satisfactory as was expected, extensive sales of land having since taken place. (5th Report, &c.)\n\nChingleput.\u2014A town in the Carnatic, situated on the north-eastern side of the Palar, 39 miles S. S. W. from Madras. Lat. 12\u00b0. 56'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 55'. E. In 1751, the French took possession of Chingleput; but it was taken from them, in\n1752, by Capt. Clive, after a short siege.\n\n**Chinirpooram**, (Chinrayapatan).\u2014A town in the Rajah of Mysore's territories, 39 miles N. W. from Seringapatam. Lat. 12\u00b0.53'. N. Long. 76\u00b0.40'. E.\n\nThe fort of Chinrayapatan is well built of stone and lime, and has a glacis, ditch, and walls built of these materials, and round towers and bastions, with embrasures for cannon. It has a weekly fair, but no considerable trade. The country around is very bare of trees, but contains many fine tanks. The town, fort, and suburbs, contain above 900 houses, of which 60 are inhabited by Brahmins. The name Chinrayapatan signifies the city of the little prince. In Nepaul, the year 1802 was Srimoca; whereas, at this place, it was Dunbuddi, a difference of 11 years. (F. Buchanan, Lord Valentia, &c.)\n\n**Chinnachin.**\u2014A town in Northern Hindostan, in the district of Jemlah, of which it is the capital, and tributary to the Ghooorkhali Rajah of Nepaul. Lat. 30\u00b0.29'. N. Long. 81\u00b0.35'. E.\n\nThis place is situated in a valley, the north side of which is bounded by the mountains of Himalaya. The town stands between the Chinnachin and Kurnala Rivers, which are said to unite at a point, distant about six days journey to the south west of Chinnachin. It is the frontier station of Nepaul, in the Taklakhar quarter, and is the best route for supplying the north-west part of Tibet with British goods. It is about 10 days journey distant from Beeni Shehr, and a month's journey for a caravan from Catmandoo. (Kirkpatriek, &c.)\n\n**Chinnoor.**\u2014A town belonging to the Nizam, in the province of Bejaipoor, 47 miles N. N. W. from Balhary. Lat. 15\u00b0.40'. Long. 76\u00b0.34'. E.\n\n**Chinnoor.**\u2014A town belonging to the Nizam, in the province of Berar, situated on the north-east side of the Godavery River. Lat. 19\u00b0.8'. N. Long. 80\u00b0.8'. E.\n\n**Chinsura**, (Chinchura).\u2014A Dutch settlement in the province of Bengal, situated on the west side of the River Hoogly, 22 miles from Calcutta. Lat. 22\u00b0.52'. N. Long. 88\u00b0.28'. E. The first factory of the Dutch East India Company was erected here in 1656, and the site on the whole is much preferable to that of Calcutta. In 1769 Chinsura was blockaded by the Nabob of Bengal's forces, to compel payment of the arrears of duties, although the province was then actually possessed by the English East Company. It has since been regularly captured by the British forces, on the commencement of hostilities with the Dutch. (Stavorinus, Renel, &c.)\n\n**Chinaub**, (or Chandrabhaga).\u2014This river has its source near the eastern hills of Cashmere, in the province of Lahore, near the sources of the Ravey, the Beyah, the Sutuleje, and the Jumna. It flows afterwards in a south-westerly direction, with a remarkably straight course. From Jumnoo it proceeds through a flat country, gradually approaching the Behut, with which it unites near Jehungscal. This junction is effected with great noise and violence, which circumstance is noticed both by the historians of Alexander and Timour. The space between the Behut and the Chinaub is nowhere more than 35 miles, within the limits of the Punjab. About 90 miles from its source, and not far from the Cashmere hills, it is 70 yards broad, and very rapid. The length of its course, including the windings, may be estimated at 420 miles.\n\nThe ancient Hindoo name of this river was the Chandra Bhaga, or Chandra Sarita, and it is considered as the aesines of Alexander. Abul Fazel, in 1582, describes it as follows:\n\n\"Another river of Lahore is the Chinaub, called also Chunderbahka, (Chandra Bhaga). From the top of the mountains of Khutwar issue two...\"\nsprings, one called Chunder, and the other Bahka. In the neighbourhood of Khutwar they unite their streams, and are then called Chunderbahka; from thence they flow on to Belolipoor, Sooderah, and Hezarch.\" (Renel, Wilford, Abul Fazel, &c.)\n\nChiring.\u2014A village in Northern Hindostan, one-half of which is situated in the Gerwal (Serinagur district), and the other half in the district of Kemaoon. The range of mountains here forms the boundary between the two provinces. It was formerly a place of some note, but is now in ruins, and destitute of inhabitants. Near to it is a large village, named Chaparang. (Raper, &c.)\n\nChitlong.\u2014A small town in Northern Hindostan, in the territories of Nepaul, named also Lohari, or Little Nepaul. Lat. 27\u00b0 29'. N. Long. 85\u00b0 52'. E. This town contains a few brick and tiled houses of two or three stories, but is an inconsiderable place, although the first in the Nepaul country that has the appearance of a town to the traveller coming from the south. It is said to have been formerly more extensive and flourishing.\n\nDuring the dynasty of the Newar princes, Chitlong was for some time a dependency of the Patn raje, or sovereignty, and had a district annexed to it containing several populous villages. It constitutes at present part of the jaghire, or fief, of one of the four commanders of the Nepaul forces. On the 27th Feb. 1793, the mercury in Fahrenheit's thermometer fell to 29\u00b0; and, on the following morning, all the standing water was found frozen to a considerable depth. (Kirkpatrick, &c.)\n\nChitpoor.\u2014A town in the province of Gujrat, belonging to an independent rajah, situated in a mountainous and jungly district. Lat. 21\u00b0 26'. N. Long. 70\u00b0 47'. E.\n\nChittagong, (Chaturgrama).\u2014A district situated at the south-eastern extremity of the province of Bengal, between the 21st and 23d degrees of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by the Tipperah district; to the south by Aracan; to the east it has the Birman empire; and to the west the sea. In length it may be estimated at 120 miles, by 25' the average breadth.\n\nThis district contains about 2987 square miles of unproductive, hilly, and plain arable lands, nearly in the proportion of two to one, and was originally divided into four moderately large, and 140 very small pargannahs, partitioned among 1400 landholders. This distribution originated in consequence of the whole district having formerly been assigned for the militia, or garrison troops, constantly maintained here for protection against the incursions of the Muggs or Aracaners. These, in process of time, became distinct zemindaries, when the military establishment ceased to be necessary.\n\nThe land is of a hilly and jungly nature, and but a small proportion of it in cultivation. It appears adapted for the production of coffee, pepper, and the valuable spices of the east; and it possesses a very convenient sea-port, Islamabad, for coasting traders in the bay at any season of the year. Ships of a considerable size are annually built here of timber, the produce of the country, in addition to a small quantity imported; and the company have an extensive establishment on the sea coast for the manufacture of salt. Landed property in this district is for the most part distributed into very small portions among numerous proprietors, which occasions incessant disputes respecting the boundaries.\n\nThe River Nauf, which bounds the British and Birman territories, is situated at a considerable distance from the town of Islamabad, the seat of provincial government, and residence of the English magistrate. The banks of this river are covered with deep jungles, interspersed with scanty spots of cultivation and a few wretched villages, where dwelt the\npoorer class of herdsmen and families of roving hunters, whose occupation is to catch and tame wild elephants, which abound in these forests.\n\nThe sea coast of Chittagong is much resorted to by the European inhabitants of Bengal, on account of the beneficial effects of the sea air and salt water bathing. About 20 miles to the north of Islamabad is a remarkable hot well, (named seetacond) the surface of which may be inflamed by the application of fire. Like all other remarkable phenomena of nature, it is esteemed sacred by the Hindoos; as is likewise another hot spring near to Monghir.\n\nChittagong, it is probable, originally belonged to the extensive and independent kingdom of Tipperah; but being a frontier province, where the two religions of Brahma and Buddha met, it was sometimes governed by sectaries of the one doctrine, and sometimes of the other. There is reason to believe it was taken from both about the beginning of the 16th century by the Afghan Kings of Bengal; and afterwards, during the wars of the Moguls and Afghans, reverted to the Buddhists of Aracan. Chittagong was first visited by the Portuguese so early as 1618; and the Rajah of Aracan having influenced a great number of that nation to settle there, in conjunction with the Muggs or Aracaners, they infested and desolated the southeastern quarters of Bengal, which, distant as the period is, has not yet recovered its population or cultivation.\n\nIn 1638, during the reign of the Emperor Shah Jehan, Makat Ray, one of the Mugg chiefs, who held Chittagong for the Rajah of Aracan, having incurred his displeasure, and apprehending an attack, sought the Mogul sovereign's protection. This is the first authentic account of the superiority of this province being acquired by the Mogul, nor was it taken possession of until 1666; yet, long before this period, it was regularly enumerated by Abul Fazel in the list of the Mogul dominions. In 1666, Shaista Khan, the soubahdar of Bengal, having equipped a powerful fleet at Dacca, dispatched it down the Megna, under the command of Omaid Khan, who, having previously conquered the Island of Sundee, proceeded against this province, and laid siege to the capital. Although strongly fortified, and containing, according to the Mogul historians, 1223 cannon of different calibres, it made but a feeble resistance; and, on its surrender, a new name (Islamabad) was conferred on it, and it was with the district permanently annexed to the Mogul empire.\n\nThis province, at an early period, attracted the notice of the English East India Company, who, in 1686, proposed to remove their factory from Hooghly to Chittagong, and there establish by force a respectable fortified residence. On the 17th Dec. 1689, during a rupture with the Emperor Aurengzebe, an English fleet appeared off Chittagong, with an intention of seizing it, and there fixing the head of their settlements in the Bay of Bengal; but, owing to indecision, nothing was done; nor would it have answered the Company's views, had the original purpose been accomplished. In A.D. 1760 it was finally ceded to the East India Company, by the Nabob Jaffer Ali Khan.\n\nIn 1801, by the directions of the Marquis Wellesley, then governor-general, the board of revenue in Bengal circulated various questions to the collectors of the different districts on statistical subjects. The result of their replies tended to establish the fact, that the Chittagong district contained 1,200,000 inhabitants, which appears an astonishing number, if the modern boundaries of the district have not been enlarged. Of this population the proportion of Mahommedans was three to five Hindoos; and what is remarkable, although so long under a Buddhist government, very few of that sect\nare now to be found in the district. (J. Grant, Stewart, Symes, Bruce, 5th Report, &c.)\n\nCHITTAPET.\u2014A small town in the Carnatic, 75 miles S.W. from Madras, and 50 N.W. from Pondicherry. Lat. 12\u00b0. 25'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 26'. E.\n\nDuring the Carnatic war in the last century this was a fort of considerable consequence, and sustained several sieges. It then had round towers at the angles of the wall, more spacious than the generality of the forts of Coromandel. The gateway on the northern side was the largest pile of this construction in the Carnatic, being capable of containing on its terraces 500 men, drawn up under arms. Chittapet was finally taken by Col. Coote, after the battle of Wandiwash, having made but a slight resistance. (Orme, &c.)\n\nCHITTELDROOG, (Chitra Durga).\u2014A fort and town belonging to the Mysore Rajah, the capital of a district of the same name. Lat. 14\u00b0. 10'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 29'. E. By the natives it is called Sitala Durga, which signifies the spotted castle; and also Chatracal, which means the umbrella rock. It is everywhere surrounded by low, rocky, bare hills, on one of which stands the droog, or fort, formerly the residence of the polygar of the country. In the year 1776 Hyder took it by treachery, at which time the town was very large. It is still a considerable place, and as a fortress, one of the strongest in India. In the usual style of the Indian fortified rocks, it is surrounded by several walls within one another, the outermost of which might be taken without forwarding the reduction of the hill.\n\nThe plain of Chitteldroog consists of a black soil, and is 10 miles from north to south, and four from east to west; but, owing to a deficiency of water, the quantity of rice land is small. To reach the water the wells must be made deep, and what is procured is of a bad quality. This may, in part, be attributed to the common nastiness of the Hindoos, who wash their clothes, bodies, and cattle, in the same tanks and wells from which they take their own beverage. The whole neighbouring country is reckoned unhealthy, although it is perfectly dry and clear. The natives assert, that every country is unhealthy in which the black soil called eray abounds. Throughout this principality and the neighbouring country of Hara-puniya-hully, (which last belongs to the Company) sheep are an object of great importance, and are of a species called enri, in the language of Karnata.\n\nThe chiefship of the villages in this district is a hereditary officer, as is usual, through the Mysore Rajah's possessions, and he acts as priest to the village god. Almost every village has a peculiar deity of this kind, and most of them are believed to be of a destructive nature. The natives propitiate them by putting an iron hook through the skin under their shoulder blades, by which they are suspended to a moveable transverse beam, and swung round for a considerable time.\n\nAt the conclusion of the last Mysore war, in 1799, in consequence of repeated ravages and calamities, many districts in the Mysore province, formerly well peopled, were totally laid waste, and scarcely exhibited a vestige of population. Chitteldroog in particular suffered in a pre-eminent degree, and was deprived of the great mass of its inhabitants.\n\nTravelling distance from Seringapatam, 115 miles; from Madras, 335 miles. (F. Buchanan, Wilkes, Moor, Rennel, &c.)\n\nCHITORE, (Chaitor).\u2014A Rajpoot district in the province of Ajmeer, situated to the south-west of Joudpoor, and bordering on Gujrat and Malwah. The sovereign of this country is named indiscriminately the Ranah of Chitore, or Odeypoor; but, in modern times, the latter town, having become the capital, has great-\nly superseded the first; the reader is, therefore, referred to the article ODEYPOR for further details respecting this territory, which, in 1582, was described by Abul Fazel as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Chitore, containing 26 mahals; measurement 1,678,802 bee-gahs; revenue, 30,047,649 dams. Seyurghal, 360,737 dams. This circular furnishes 22,000 cavalry, and 82,000 infantry.\"\u2014See also MEWAR.\n\nCHITORE.\u2014A Rajpoot town in the province of Ajmeer, the capital of a district of the same name. Lat. 25\u00b0. 15'. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 30'. E.\n\nThis place was the ancient capital of the Rajpoot sovereign, now known by the appellation of the Ranah of Odeypoor, and much celebrated for its strength, riches, antiquity, when taken and despoiled by Acber, in 1567.\n\nThe fortress of Chitore is situated on the top of a high and rugged mountain, and is considered as a place of great strength. It was first conquered by the Mahommedans, A.D. 1303, during the reign of Alla nd Deen, the scourge of the Hindoos. It was subsequently taken by Acber, and in 1680 again subdued and plundered by Azim Ushaun, the son of Aurungzebe; permanent possession of the fortress does not, therefore, appear to have been retained by the Pattan and Mogul Emperors. In 1790 it was taken by Madajee Sindia, from Bheem Singh, a rebellious subject of the Odeypoor Rajahs, to whom it was restored agreeably to a previous agreement. (Renel, Hunter, Maurice, &c.)\n\nCHITTOR, (Chaitur).\u2014A town and district, situated on the western frontier of the Carnatic, 80 miles E. from Madras. Lat. 13\u00b0. 12'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 10'. E.\n\nThe Chittoor pollams, or small districts, came into the possession of the East India Company, under the treaty with the Nabob of Arcot, in 1801. The polygars had long been refractory and turbulent subjects of the nabob, a continuance of which rendered it necessary to send a military force against them in 1804. Two of them having surrendered at the commencement, the others were driven into the jungles, and their forts demolished; tranquillity, however, was not restored until the beginning of 1805, when the system of fixed-rents on the lands of each cultivator was introduced, which has, besides, been attended with a considerable increase of revenue. The Chittoor lands were permanently assessed in 1802-3. (5th Report, &c.)\n\nCHITTRA.\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, district of Ramgur, 100 miles S. by W. from Patna. Lat. 24\u00b0. 14'. N. Long. 81\u00b0. 58'. E.\n\nCHITWAY, (Setava).\u2014A town in the province of Malabar. Lat. 10\u00b0. 23'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 2'. E. This place is situated on an island 27 miles long, and in some places five miles broad, named Chitway by Europeans, but by the natives Manapuram. It consists of two districts, Shetuwai and Attypuram, and is separated from the continent by inlets of salt water, which form the northern part of an excellent inland navigation. The soil of this island is in general poor, and although the whole may be considered as a plain, the rice fields are small in proportion to the elevated land that rises a few feet above the level of the sea. The shores of the island are covered with cocoa nut palms, from which the revenue is chiefly derived, and the whole is rented from the Company by the Cochin Rajah for 30,000 per annum, but he possesses no legal jurisdiction over the inhabitants. The low land that lies near the sea is extremely sandy, and the quantity of rice fields insignificant. A slave here, when 30 years old, costs about 100 fanams, or 2l. 14s. 7d. with a wife the price is double. Children sell at from 15 to 46 fanams, or from 8s. 2\u00bdd. to 21s. 10d. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nCHOOKIANG SOMTOO.\u2014A lake in the Lahdack country, about 30 miles in circumference. Lat. 34\u00b0. 47'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 50'. E.\nCHOOOMEAS.\u2014A savage people, who inhabit the first range of hills to the north and east of the province of Chittagong, in Bengal, and are tributary to the British government. Their villages are called chooms, but they seldom remain longer than two years on one spot. Beyond them are the Kookies, with whom the Choomeas traffic; but the Kookies do not allow the latter ever to enter their villages. (Maer\u00e6, &c.)\n\nCHOOOMORTY, (Sumurti).\u2014A town in the Lahdaek country, situated on the north side of a river named the Khankus, which rises to the north of the Himalaya Mountains, and was formerly supposed to have been the Ganges of the Hindoos; but this conjecture has been proved unfounded by the recent expedition from Bengal, to trace the course of the Gauges, which has been found to rise on the south side of the great Himalaya Ridge. Lat. 33\u00b0. 58'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 54'. E.\n\nCHONGEY.\u2014A town in the Nahry Sankar country, situated to the north of the Himalaya Mountains. Lat. 33\u00b0. 27'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 43'. E.\n\nCHOONPOOR.\u2014A town belonging to the Maharattas, in the province of Malwah, 36 miles S. E. from Bil-sah. Lat. 23\u00b0. 17'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 48'. E.\n\nCHOORHUT.\u2014A town in the province of Allahabad, in the Boghela country, 94 miles S. W. from Benares. Lat. 24\u00b0. 29'. N. Long. 81\u00b0. 48'. E. It is situated betwixt the River Soane and the Vindhya or Kimoor Hills, and is possessed by an independent chief.\n\nCHOPRAH.\u2014A town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Khandesh, 70 miles E. of Boorhanpoor. Lat. 21\u00b0. 12'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 17'. E.\n\nCHOTEESGUR, (or Ruttunpoor).\u2014A large district in the province of Gundwana, situated principally betwixt the 22d and 23d degrees of north latitude. This province is very frequently denominated Jeharcund, but the name properly applies to great part of the Gundwana province. Choteesgur, which means 36 forts in its most extensive sense, is said to comprehend 20,000 square miles, part of which is composed of a mountainous tract, or unprofitable jungles; from which last circumstance the country acquired the name of Jeharcund. This district to the south of Ruttunpoor is a champaign country, abundantly watered with little rivers, full of villages, and ornamented with groves and tanks. In the neighbourhood of Ryepoor considerable quantities of wheat and vegetables are produced. Rice is not abundant, it being only cultivated behind large reservoirs of water, in situations where the declivity of the land is suitable.\n\nLarge quantities of grain are exported from Chotesgur all over the Nizam's dominions, and even to the Circars; from the latter salt is imported and retailed at an extravagant price. The villages are numerous, but poor. The country abounds in cattle, and brood mares of the tattoo species. On the whole, this territory is but thinly inhabited. Foreign merchants bring a few horses, elephants, camels, and shawls for sale, but the principal part of the commerce is carried on by the brinjaries, or itinerant grain dealers. In 1794 it was said that, in plentiful seasons, they could employ 100,000 bullocks in exportation, and it is certainly one of the most productive provinces under the Nagpoor Rajah. The Hatsoo and Caroon are the chief rivers, and the principal towns are Ruttunpoor and Ryepoor. The boundaries to the north begin at the village of Noaparah, which consists of only a few miserable huts.\n\nThis district was anciently comprehended in the Hindoo province of Gundwana, and composed part of the state of Gurrah; but, during the reign of Aurengzebe, it was formerly annexed to the Soubah of Allahabad, although but nominally subjected to the Mogul empire.\n1752 it was conquered by Ragojee Bhoostah, and has ever since continued in the possession of the Maharatta Rajahs of Nagpoor. (J. Grant, Blunt, &c.)\n\nChoul.\u2014A small town belonging to the Maharatta Peshwa, in the province of Aurungabad, situated on the sea-coast of the Concan district, 25 miles south from Bombay. Lat. 18\u00b0 33'. N. Long. 72\u00b0 56'. E. This was a place of considerable note during the Bhannanee dynasty of the Deccan.\n\nChoutea.\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, district of Chuta Nagpoor, 200 miles W. N. W. from Calcutta. Lat. 23\u00b0 26'. N. Long. 85\u00b0 29'. E.\n\nChowera.\u2014A town in the Gujrat Peninsula, situated about 30 miles N. by E. from Wankaneer.\n\nThis place stands on an eminence, and is surrounded by a high stone wall, with square towers, in a ruinous state. On approaching this place, after passing the Songhur Hills, there is an extensive plain of rich soil; but the peasantry being of castes that are averse to agriculture, the whole remains in a state of pasturage. During the dry season the adjacent villages are badly supplied with water, yet it is found by digging not far from the surface. (Marvardo, &c.)\n\nChowpareh.\u2014A town in the province of Lahore, situated on the east side of the Indus, a few miles above its junction with the Sohna River. Lat. 32\u00b0 10'. N. Long. 70\u00b0 50'. E.\n\nChuganserai.\u2014An Afghan town in the province of Kabul, district of Murdurian, situated on the west side of the Chuganserai River. Lat. 34\u00b0 56'. N. Long. 70\u00b0 57'. E.\n\nChuka.\u2014A castle in Bootan, near to which is a chain bridge of a remarkable construction, stretched over the River Tehinchien. Lat. 27\u00b0 20'. N. Long. 89\u00b0 27'. E. This fortress is a large building, placed on elevated ground, with only one entrance into it. It is built of stone, and the walls are of a prodigious thickness. The natives have no record when the bridge of chains was erected; they say it was fabricated by the Devata (inferior deity) Te-huptchap. The adjacent country abounds with strawberries, which are, however, seldom eaten by the natives of Bootan. Here are also many well known English plants, such as docks, nettles, primroses, and dog rose bushes. (Turner, &c.)\n\nChukree Ghaute.\u2014A ferry over the Beyah River, in the province of Lahore, which, at this place, in the dry season, flows in two branches; the waters of which are deep, but not rapid. In the rainy season the breadth is one mile and a half. (11th Reg., &c.)\n\nChumbul.\u2014This river has its source near the ancient city of Mundun, in the centre of the province of Malwah, within 15 miles of the Nerbuddah. From thence it pursues a north-easterly direction; and, after washing the city of Kotah, and receiving many smaller streams, it falls into the Jumna, 20 miles below Etaweh. The breadth of its channel at the Ford Kyterce, near Dhoolpoor, is three quarters of a mile, and the whole length of its course 440 miles. At Keyterce, the southern bank is bold and lofty; and, in the rainy season, when the channel is full, the prospect of such a body of water, bounded by hills of various shapes, forms a contrast to the vast plain between the Jumna and the Ganges.\n\nThis river is often named the Sumbul, and is supposed, by Major Rennel, to be the Sambus of Arrian. It now forms the boundary which separates the British territories in Hindostan Proper from those of Dowlut Row Sindia to the south. (Hunter, Malcolm, Rennel, &c.)\n\nChumpaneer, (Chamanir).\u2014A district in the province of Gujrat, principally situated between the 22d and 23d degrees of north latitude. It is bounded on the north by the district of Gujrat; on the south by\nthe Nerbuddah; on the east by Gu-dara; and on the west by Broach and Cambay. The chief towns are Chumpaneer, Hullal, and Alymohun, and the principal rivers the Nerbud-dah and Mahy.\n\nA great proportion of this district is either immediately possessed by the Maharattas, or occupied by chiefs tributary to them. The principal Maharatta Prince is the Gui-cowar, whose dominions lie in this quarter of Gujrat. In 1582 the district of Chumpaneer is described by Abul Fazel as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Chumpaneer, containing nine mahals; measurement, 800,337 beegahs; revenue, 10,109,884 dams. This sircar furnishes 550 cavalry, and 1600 infantry.\"\n\nChumpaneer.\u2014A town in the province of Gujrat, district of Chum-panneer, of which it is the capital, 55 miles E. by N. from Cambay. Lat. 22\u00b0.31'. N. Long. 73\u00b0.37'. E.\n\nThe town of Chumpaneer is surrounded by a wall of massy stones, 950 yards long by 350 broad, and defended by 42 towers. In 1582 it is described by Abul Fazel as a place of considerable size and strength; and the ruins of Hindoo temples, and Mahommedan mosques, for many miles round, prove its former grandeur. The houses of the present town are wretched huts, raised on blocks and pillars, of the once magnificent edifices of the Moguls.\n\nAbul Fazel thinks this city was originally built by Champa, a market man of the Bhel caste, who gave it his own name. In 1534 it was the capital of Gujrat, at which period it was taken and plundered by the Emperor Humayoon. (6th Reg. &c. &c.)\n\nChunar.\u2014A district in the province of Allahabad, situated about the 25th degree of north latitude. It is bounded on the north by the Ganges; on the south by the Soane; on the east by the Caramnassa; and on the west by Tarrar and Bogale-cund. The northern part of this district is a most fertile tract of country, and in a very flourishing state with respect to commerce and manufactures; but towards the south it is mountainous, jungly, and exhibits few traces of cultivation or population. The Vindhy, a chain of hills, which extend so far across Hindostan, to the north of Nerbud-dah, penetrate into the Chunar territory, and occupy the southern extremity. The principal towns are Mirzapoor and Chunghur, to which, formerly, might have been added Bidjeceghur, now in ruins. The Bo-ker River divides the country, called Chundail, from the pargannah of Suctasghur, in the Chunar district.\n\nIn this district, where the pastures are common to a whole village, each tenant puts as many cattle of different sorts on it as he chooses. The land is, consequently, overstocked, and the cattle starved. During the dry season, and more particularly during the hot winds, every thing like verdure disappears. The grass-cutters, a class of tenants kept by Europeans to procure food for their horses, will bring provender from a field when verdure is scarcely visible. They use a sharp instrument, with which they cut the grass below the surface, and these roots, when cleared of earth by washing, afford the only green food which it is possible to procure.\n\nTurnips, cabbages, carrots, and greens, are raised in the gardens of Europeans during the cold season; but no art can preserve them against the deadly influence of the hot winds, though in each garden a supply of water is daily drawn by two bullocks.\n\nChunar formed part of the Benares zemindary, and was acquired by the East India Company by treaty, in 1775, along with the rest of that province.\n\nIn 1582 it is described by Abul Fazel as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Chunar, containing 18 mahals; measurement, 106,270 beegahs; revenue, 5,810,654 dams. Sey-urghal, 109,065 dams. This sircar\nCHUPPARAH.\n\nfurnishes 500 cavalry, and 18,000 infantry.\" (Tennant, Blunt, Abul Fazal, &c.)\n\nChunarghur.\u2014A town and fortress in the province of Allahabad, district of Chunar, situated on the south side of the Ganges. Lat. 25\u00b0 9'. N. Long. 82\u00b0 54'. E. The fort is situated on a free-stone rock, several hundred feet high, which rises abruptly from the plain, and advances some distance into the river. It is fortified in the Indian manner, with walls and towers, one behind the other, and is a place of considerable strength. The prospect from its summit is one of the finest imaginable. The town of Chunar is a straggling collection of native huts and European bungalows. The batteries here completely command the navigation of the river, and allow no boat to go up or down without inspection. At certain seasons of the year Chunar is excessively hot, and very unhealthy.\n\nThe approach to the town from the north is marked by a chain of low hills, running parallel to the river on its right bank, which is covered with plantations and bungalows.\n\nIn 1530 Chunarghur was the residence of Shere Khan, the Afghan, who expelled the Emperor Humayoon from Hindostan. In 1575 it was taken by the Moguls, after a siege of six months. In 1763 this fortress, after repulsing a night attack of the British troops, was, some time afterwards, delivered up without a siege, and has ever since remained in the Company's possession. It was a place of great importance in former times; but, as the British frontier has been carried further north, Allahabad has superseded it as a military depot.\n\nTravelling distance from Calcutta, by Moorshedabad, 574 miles; by Birbom, 469 miles. (Lord Valentia, Tennant, Gholum Hossein, Ferishta, Rennel, &c.)\n\nChundail, (Chandela).\u2014A district in the province of Allahabad, situated between the 24th and 25th degrees of north latitude. It is separated from the British district of Chunar by the River Roker, besides which it has the Soane and many smaller streams.\n\nThe natives of this country call themselves Chundails, and are a tribe of Rajpoots, the usual residence of their rajah being at Rajepoor, 20 miles west of Bedjeeghur. The country became tributary to the Rajahs of Benares, in the days of Bulwunt Singh, who conquered it; for it had never been thoroughly subdued by the Moguls, although formally annexed to the Soubah of Allahabad by Aurengzebe.\n\nThis territory is very thinly inhabited, and many parts of it a complete wilderness. The road south from the British deminicius is over a number of small hills, with scarcely a vestige of a habitation; there being few permanent villages, the inhabitants being accustomed to change their sites very frequently. The inhabitants of these hills are named Karwar, and are a very savage tribe, acknowledging allegiance to a vassal of the Burdee Rajah's, who resides at Buddery, and divided into many sects. (Blunt, &c.)\n\nChunder, (Chandra).\u2014A small town in the Afghan territories in the province of Mooltan, situated on the north side of the Dummoody River, 90 miles S. from the town of Mooltan. Lat. 29\u00b0 18'. N. Long. 71\u00b0 29'. E.\n\nChupparah.\u2014A town in the province of Gundwana, situated on the Bein Gunga River, 87 miles N. from Nagpoor. Lat. 22\u00b0 22'. N. Long. 80\u00b0 2'. E.\n\nThis place is famous for the manufacture of iron, a great quantity of which is carried into the British provinces. A considerable district in this part of Gundwana is held by a Patan chief, who received it in Jaghire from the first Raggojee Bhouslah, as a reward for services during his conquest of Gundwana, and the northern parts of Berar.\nThe town is consequently chiefly inhabited by Afghans. (Leckie, &c.)\n\nChuprail.\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, district of Sarun, of which it is the capital, situated on the north side of the Ganges, 32 miles W. N. W. from Patna. Lat. 25\u00b0. 46'. N. Long. 84\u00b0. 46'. E.\n\nOn May 2, 1757, Major Coote (afterwards Sir Eyre) reached this place, in pursuit of a French corps under Mr. Law, being the earliest advance of the British forces in this quarter. Mr. Law and his party were afterwards taken prisoners by General Carnac, on the 15th January, 1761, after a victory obtained over the Shahzada, (the Mogul emperor's son), who very soon afterwards surrendered himself also.\n\nChuwal.\u2014A district in the province of Gujrat, situated betwixt the 23d and 24th degrees of north latitude; and bounded on the west by the Banass River, which afterwards flows towards the Gulf of Cutch. The quarter of this district adjacent to the Banass is low fenny land, and subject to inundation; but very little is known respecting the other parts, as this division of Gujrat has as yet been very imperfectly explored. It is possessed by different independent native chiefs.\n\nCicacole, (Chicacola).\u2014The largest of the Northern Circars or districts, anciently named Calinga, and situated between the 17th and 20th degrees of north latitude. It is subdivided into two portions. The first lies between the River Setteveran on the south; the River Poondy on the north; and extends about 170 miles along the Bay of Bengal. In its greatest dimensions, it extends in land to the mountainous region on the west, about 60 miles; comprising an area of about 4400 square miles. The second subdivision of this province is of a triangular figure, stretching about 80 miles from Poondy to Moland, on the southern frontier of Cuttaek, and 50 miles to the N. W. angle at Goonsur. It contains about 1600 miles of superficial measure, exclusive of that portion of country situated along the great ridge of boundary mountains to the west.\n\nThe climate of the Northern Circars (of which Cicacole forms a large portion), with a general conformity to that of Hindostan, north of the Krishna, has, from local position and other circumstances, some peculiarities in each of the three seasons. The periodical rain usually sets in about the middle of June, with a westerly wind, in moderate showers, until the end of August, which month concludes the small rain harvest. From this time the grain continues in greater abundance until the beginning of November, when it generally breaks up with violence, and is succeeded by the northeasterly wind.\n\nThe middle of this latter and pleasant season, early in January, finishes the harvest for rice and bajary; which are the great productions of the country north of the Godaverry. The close of the vernal equinox terminates the third harvest, which is the grand one for maize, as well as for all the different species of grain and pease south of that river. Then begins the hot season, which is always extremely moderate towards the northern extremity of the Circars, near Ganjam, by reason of constant diurnal sea breezes; and the position of the neighbouring hills from south to west contrary to the ordinary direction of the wind at Masulipatam.\n\nThe southern division of Cicacole, with a better soil than is found in the other parts of the Circar, is watered by four rivers, which have their outlets at Vizagapatam, Bimlepatam, Cicacole, and Calingapatam, besides many lesser streams during the rains. Northward in the territory of Jhapoor, the land is fertilized by the Ganjam, and other smaller rivers. The province of Cicacole, taken altogether, has few extensive plains, and its hills increase in frequency and magnitude as they\napproach the vast range of mountains that bound this and the district of Rajamundry to the north-west. The hills and narrower bottoms which separate them, were formerly suffered by the native chiefs to be overrun with jungle, as the best protection to the opener valleys allotted for cultivation. During the Carnatic wars that province was supplied with considerable quantities of rice from Cieacole; but since the restoration of tranquillity, and transfer of the Arcot dominions to the Company, the necessity for importation has greatly diminished.\n\nThis district was ceded to the French, in 1753, by Salabut Jung, the Soubahdar of the Deccan, at which period it extended from the Godavary to the Pagoda of Juggernauth. At this time the French possessed territories greater, both in value and extent, than had ever been possessed in Hindostan by Europeans, not excepting the Portuguese when at the height of their prosperity. It was acquired by the British, in 1765, during the government of Lord Clive. (J. Grant, Orme, White, &c.)\n\nCicacole, (or Maplus Bunder.) \u2014A town in the Northern Circars, the ancient capital of an extensive district of the same name, 118 miles S.W. from Ganjam. Lat. 18\u00b0 21'. N. Long. 83\u00b0 57'. E. Here is a mosque of considerable sanctity, erected in the year of the Hegera 1051, by Shekh Mahommed Khan.\n\nCIRCARS, (Northern.)\n\nA large province extending along the west side of the Bay of Bengal, from the 15th to the 20th degrees of north latitude, and appertaining partly to the Deccan, and partly to Orissa. The sea bounds it to the east, along a coast of 470 miles from Mootapilly, its southern extremity, to Malond in Orissa, on the borders of the Chilka Lake. It is divided from the provinces of Hyderabad by a range of small detached hills extending to the banks of the Godavary, and to the north of that river separated from Berar by a continued ridge of mountains almost impassable for horse or wheeled carriage, to the north-western extremity of the Circars at Goomsur. From hence the chain of hills curves to the eastward, and, with the Chilka Lake, form a barrier of 50 miles to the north, except a tongue of land betwixt that lake and the sea. Towards the south the small river Gundezaama, which empties itself at Mootapilly, separates the Circars from Ongole and the Carnatic below the Ghauts.\n\nThe area, or superficial contents of the Circars, may be calculated at 17,000 geographic miles, of which (in 1784) one-fifth was estimated to be in cultivation, or fallow, two-fifths in pasture, and the remainder woods, water, towns; barren hills, or a sandy waste three miles in extent, bordering the whole extent of the sea coast.\n\nThe grand divisions of this territory are naturally five, principally marked by rivers running across from the hills on the western frontier. These divisions are Guntoor, or Mortizabad; Condapilly, or Mustaphabad; Ettore, Rajamundry, and Cicacole, anciently called Calinga.\n\nThe climate of this region to the north of the Godavary is described under the article Cicacole; to the south of that river, for the first two months, strong southerly gales prevailing along shore, together with the sea breezes, moderate the heat; but the hateful influence of the former, in blowing over salt stagnant marshes on the coast, is injurious to animal life, and destruction to vegetation. During the succeeding month, until the rains, the wind coming from the west over a parched loose soil of great extent, uninterrupted by any continued chain of hills, and along the broad, sandy, and almost dry bed of the Krishna, becomes so intolerably hot near the mouth of that\nriver, as to raise the thermometer sometimes for an entire week to $110^\\circ$ within the house, and seldom under $105^\\circ$ during the first part of the day. Another peculiarity of the climate is the noxious state of the air in all the hilly regions throughout the different seasons of vegetation, which occasions the distemper called the hill fever. This has been attributed to many causes, but is probably owing to the grossness of the atmosphere, charged with the exhalations of a luxuriant soil pent up in valleys, having the free circulation impeded by the surrounding jungle and forests. From Coringa to Ganjam the coast, as seen from the sea, appears mountainous; and from Coringa southwards low, flat, and sandy.\n\nIn all these provinces along the sea coast the soil is chiefly sandy, improving gradually towards the hills. The same ground seldom yields more than one crop of grain annually, but there being plenty of water, this is generally a heavy one. There are many small rivers running towards the sea, divided artificially into canals, and afterwards conducted into the tanks and great reservoirs.\n\nThe principal quadrupeds found in these districts are sheep, and the larger species of horned cattle. The neighbouring sea, and its numerous inlets, abound with every sort of Indian fish. The Circars are exceedingly productive of grain, and formerly, during the north-easterly monsoon, were the granary of the Carnatic, in like manner as Tanjore was reckoned on during the southwest monsoon. Fruits, roots, and greens, are scarce, and raised with difficulty to the south of the Godavery; and even to the north of that river, owing, it is supposed, to the influence of the sea air. Sugar and cotton are produced, and of the latter a great deal is brought from the interior provinces; bay salt, and tobacco, (the latter excellent) are both exported. The forests of Rajamundry, from the commencement of the hills along the banks of the Godavery to Palounshah, yield an abundance of large teak trees.\n\nPlain long cloth is wrought in the Island of Nagore and its vicinity, which forms the groundwork of the best printed calicoes in Europe, and those called palempores at Masulipatam; coarser plain cloths are made to the north and south of the Godavery. The muslins of Cicacole, the woollen carpets of Ellore, and the silks of Berhampoor, are rather objects of curiosity than considerable in quantity. The latter are made of silk imported from Bengal and China. Ships of 500 tons have been constructed at Coringa and Narsipoor, the two principal mouths of the Godavery, and about 50,000 tons of small craft are employed in the coasting trade. The exports to Europe are chiefly the fine cotton manufactures. A great proportion of the coasting trade is carried on with Madras, and consists chiefly of grain, the returns for which from Madras are the coarser sorts of cloths. The articles carried to the interior by the native inland traders are salt and piece goods, copper and raw silk from Bengal, the returns for which are principally cotton and wheat.\n\nThe principal part of the Madras investment of piece goods is provided in the Northern Circars. The thread is generally spun by the cultivating caste of inhabitants, and there are regulations enacted for the protection of the weavers. The latter, on the whole, has the means of being more comfortable than the labouring class, but they are commonly of a more dissipated turn, and squander away their surplus gains in gaming and cock fighting. The female population at large, in general, prepare the thread, and sell the produce of their week's work to the weaver at the market, and procure cotton sufficient for the next week. The females also, of decayed families, who have little means of employing themselves from the secluded nature of\ntheir lives, derive from this source a support for their feeble existence.\n\nA considerable part of the cotton used in the manufactures is raised in the country, and the rest brought from the Nizam's and Maharatta countries by traders who return to the interior with salt. The cotton raised within the province is preferred, being cleaner, but the crop is very precarious. Every cultivator allots some portion of ground for cotton, and it is productive with a good season, but either too much or too little rain destroys it. The cleaning process is performed by a distinct tribe, whose occupation it is.\n\nThe internal commerce of Madras with the Northern Circars, may be classed under the heads of northern and southern coasting trade; the northern partaking more of the Bengal and Rangoon trade, while the southern has a large proportion of that of the eastward, Ceylon, and the Malabar coast. The traffic is mostly carried on by the natives, and in the craft which they navigate; some exception, however, must be made regarding piece goods, the great staple of the Circars, which are considered too valuable to be confided to such craft.\n\nIn 1811-12 these piece goods were punjam cloths of various descriptions to a large amount, besides those in use among the natives of Madras. The piece goods from the Masulipatam district are mostly coloured goods, which are again re-exported to Bombay, and some to the Persian Gulf; but most of the shipments for the latter place are made direct from Masulipatam.\n\nThe next considerable article of export from the Northern Circars is grain, which in seasons of common produce is exported annually to Madras, and consists chiefly of rice, paddy, wheat, with numerous other edible grains used only by the natives; to these may be added horse gram, sonegalloo, with a very large proportion of oil seeds. In the first four months of 1812, when grain was high at Madras, the quantity sent from this province, within that short period, amounted to the sum of 1,031,690 sicca rupees. In 1811 the indigo exported to Madras amounted to 45,329 sicca rupees; and the rum distilled in the district of Ganjam, and sent to Madras, mostly for the use of the navy, amounted to 87,708 rupees.\n\nGoods are frequently landed in this province by vessels trading from Bengal, and afterwards exported to Madras, amongst which number are long pepper root, shimbins, and stick lac. Among the other exports to Madras are chillies, fire wood, coriander seeds, cashew nuts, and many other trifling articles in use among the natives, both as drugs, and such as are required for the performance of their multifarious religious ceremonies.\n\nThe exports and re-exports from Madras to the Northern Circars are not so considerable as might have been expected, when the great military force and population of the province are considered, and also that Hyderabad, the Nizam's capital, receives part of its supplies through Masulipatam. Among the imports which the Northern Circars receives from Madras, are some piece goods sent there to be painted, and a small quantity of coir cables and cordage for the use of native vessels resorting to the port of Coringa. Treasure is also exported from Madras to the northern parts for the purchase of salt, and of investments for the English market.\n\nThe re-exports from Madras to the Northern Circars are chiefly European and China goods, for the consumption of officers and others employed in that quarter, to which may be added some European goods for the purpose of manufacture. The most valuable of the above articles are Madeira, claret, port wine, ale, brandy, ollman's stores, glass ware, stationery, tea, with copper of various kinds, steel, hardware, &c. To these may be added various goods\nreceived from the eastward, such as betel nut to a large amount, alum, cloves, benjamiu, pepper, tin, dammer, and borax. A quantity of arrack is also received from Madras, a considerable proportion of which is afterwards forwarded to Hyderabad, for the use of the European troops stationed there.\n\nThe native inhabitants of the Northern Circars, exclusive of a few thousand Mahommedans dispersed in the different towns, are wholly Hindoos, and may be estimated in number at two and a half millions. They are composed of the two nations of Telinga and Oria, Ooria, or Orissa, formerly divided by the Godavery, but greatly intermixed since their union. They speak and write different dialects, and have rites, customs, and characteristic traits perfectly distinguishable from each other. The four great castes, or subdivisions of the people, are common in both countries; but the Orias are supposed to deviate less from the original institutions than the others. The Brahmins continue to enjoy their pre-eminence. The Rachwars, Rowwars, and Velmas, of which denominations the principal zemindars are composed, affect the manner of Rajpoots, and pretend to be of the Khetce, or warlike class. The remainder are husbandmen, cow herds, weavers; together with the artificers hereafter enumerated, and maintained by the greater villages, all of the Sudra caste. In addition to these are the retail shopkeepers, who are properly of the third, or Vaisya caste.\n\nThe five Northern Circars, when acquired by the Company, consisted of zemindary and havelly lands. The first are situated in the hill country of the western frontier, and in the plains between the hills and the sea. The hill zemindars, secure in the woody and unwholesome heights which they inhabited, and encouraged by the hope of an eventual asylum in the dominions of the Nizam, or Nagpoorrajah, had often furnished examples of successful depredation, and unpunished revolt. They were surrounded by military tenants, whose lands were held on stipulations of personal service, and whose attachment to their chiefs was increased by the bond of family connexion. These zemindars consisted of three classes, 1st. The Velmas, of Teliuga origin, who were driven from the Carnatic in the year 1652 by the Mahommedan arms, and who established themselves on the borders of the Krishna. 2dly. The Rachwars, of the race of the ancient sovereigns of Orissa, who were also forced by the Mahommedans to relinquish the plains, and retire to the highland woods, which form the western frontiers. 3dly. The Worriars, being petty chieftains of the military tribe, who after the overthrow of the empire of Orissa by the Mahommedans, were enabled, by their local situation, to acquire an independent jurisdiction, their possessions being chiefly situated in the mountainous tract in the western boundary of Cicacole.\n\nAt the time this province came into the Company's hands, the zemindars were, for the most part, in a very irregular state of subjection to the Nizam, and not only the forms but the remembrance of civil authority seem to have been lost. With respect to the other class, or havelly lands, which constitute a large portion of the Northern Circars, they consisted of the demesne, or household lands of the government. They were composed of districts in the vicinity of each capital town, which were originally resumed by the Mahommedan government, and had been annexed to these towns for the supply of the garrisons and numerous establishments, both civil and military. The following is the description of a village in this province, which also applies, with little variation, to the greater part of the Deccan, and south of India.\n\nGeographically considered, it is a tract of country comprising some\nHundreds, or some thousands, acres of arable, or waste land; politically viewed, it resembles a corporation, or township. Its proper establishment of officers and servants consist of the following descriptions:\u2014The potail, or head inhabitant, who has a general superintendence of the affairs of the village, settles disputes, attends to the police, and collects the revenue within his village.\n\nThe tallia and totic: the duty of the former consists in gaining information of crimes and offences, and in escorting and protecting persons travelling from one village to another: the duties of the latter appear to be confined immediately to the village, where he guards the crops, and assists in measuring them.\n\nThe boundary-man, who preserves the limits of the village, or gives evidence respecting them in case of dispute. The curnum, or accountant.\n\nThe superintendent of the tanks and water courses distributes the water therefrom, for the purposes of agriculture.\n\nThe Brahmin, who performs the village worship.\n\nThe schoolmaster, who is seen teaching the children to read and write in the sand.\n\nThe calendar Brahmin, or astrologer, who proclaims the lucky and unpropitious periods for sowing and threshing.\n\nThe smith and carpenter, who manufacture the implements of agriculture, and build the dwelling of the cultivator.\n\nThe potman, or potter. The washerman. The barber. The cowkeeper, who looks after the cattle. The doctor. The dancing girl, who attends at rejoicings; the musician, and the poet. These officers and servants generally constitute the establishment of a Hindoo village. In addition to the portion of land appropriated to the pagoda establishment, to the local officers of government, and to the village servants, they were each entitled to certain small shares of perquisites from the crops of the villagers.\n\nUnder this simple form of government the inhabitants lived from time immemorial. The boundaries of villages have been but seldom altered; and though the villages have been sometimes injured, and even desolated, by war, famine, and disease, the same name, the same limits, the same interests, and even the same families, have continued for ages. The inhabitants give themselves no trouble about the breaking up and division of kingdoms; while the village remains entire they care not to what power it is transferred, or to what sovereign it devolves, its internal economy still remaining unchanged.\n\nIn A.D. 1541, the Mahommedans, under the command of Mahommed Khan Leshkeree, of the Bhamenee empire of Beder, carried their arms into the Northern Circars, and conquered Condapilly. Nine years afterwards they carried their arms still further, and subdued all Guptoor, and the districts of Masulipatam; but the country was very imperfectly reduced, and its subjection merely nominal, as it appears to have been again conquered from the Hindoo princes of Orissa about the year 1571, during the reign of Ibrahim Kootub Shah, of Hyderabad, or Golconda.\n\nIn 1687 these provinces, along with the empire of Hyderabad, fell under the dominion of Aurengzebe; but he does not appear to have paid much attention to them, being too busily employed elsewhere. In 1724 they were transferred from the house of Timour, on the Delhi throne, to that of Nizam ul Mookh, who immediately took active and real possession of them, collected the revenues, and fixed a civil and military establishment. He was succeeded by his third son, Salabut Jung, who being greatly indebted for his elevation to the intrigues and military assistance of the French East India\nCompany, rewarded their services, in 1752, by a grant of the district of Condavir, or Guntoor, and soon after ceded the other Circars.\n\nThe capture of Masulipatam, in 1759, by the British arms under Col. Forde, having deprived them of all real power, these territories reverted to the Nizam, with the exception of the acknowledged dependencies of the town and fortress of Masulipatam, which were retained by the English East India Company. Deprived of the support of the French, Salabut Jung was soon superseded in his authority by his brother, Nizam Ali. In 1765 Lord Clive obtained from the Mogul a grant of four of the Circars, namely, Cicecole, Rajamundry, Ellore, and Condapilly; which, in the following year, was confirmed by a treaty entered into with the Nizam. The remaining Circar of Guntoor was, at that time, in the possession of Bazalet Jung, the brother of the Nizam, by whom it was held in Jaghire. It was contingently stipulated for in the treaty with the Nizam, subject to the life of Bazalet Jung, who died in 1782; but it did not devolve to the East India Company until the year 1783.\n\nThe local government of the Northern Circars was continued under the management of the natives until 1769, when provincial chiefs and councils were appointed, and this mode of government continued until 1794. During this period the power of the zemindars was very great, and, in 1777, it was calculated that the number of armed men maintained by them in the Circars amounted to 41,000. In 1794 a change in the internal government of this province took place, which was followed by the punishment of the great zemindar of Vizianagaram, and the restoration of such zemindars as had been unjustly deprived of their lands by that family. Little progress, however, has yet been made in the proper arrangement of these Circars, compared with other provinces similarly situated, although a considerable improvement has taken place in the general character and efficiency of the revenue department. The system of a permanent settlement of the territorial revenue was introduced and established in the Northern Circars during the years 1802 and 1804, when the province was divided into five collectorships, or districts, viz. Ganjam, Vizagapatam, Rajamundry, Masulipatam, and Guntoor. (J. Grant, 5th Report, White, Johnson, Rennel, R. Grant, &c.)\n\nClapps Isles, or Cocoa Isles.\u2014A number of very small islands, lying off the south-western extremity of Java. Lat. 7\u00b0. 5'. S. Long. 105\u00b0. 25'. N. These islands are uninhabited, and only occasionally resorted to for the sake of the edible bird nests, which are found on them.\n\nCocoa Isles.\u2014A cluster of very small isles, lying off the west coast of Sumatra.

To the north it is bounded by the Malabar province; on the south by Travancor; on the east it has the Dindigul district; and on the west the sea.\n\nIn the northern parts of this province, about Pargunuru and Shilacary, the rice grounds are narrow valleys, but extremely well watered by small perennial streams, which enable the cultivators to raise two crops of rice annually. The houses of the natives are buried in groves of palms, mangoes, jacks, and plantains, that skirt the bottom of the little hills. Above them are woods of forest trees, which, although not so stately as those of Chittagong, are very fine, and free from rattans, and other climbers. The teak and viti, a black wood, abound in these fo-\nrests; but all the large trees have been cut, and no care is used to encourage their growth, and check that of useless timber.\n\nTowards Cacadu the hills are much lower, and covered with grass in place of trees. Scarcely any part of these hills is cultivated, although the soil appears to be good, and the pasture excellent. In this province are many Nazarene, or Christian, villages, inhabited by Christians of St. Thomas, which are, in general, well built and cleanly.\n\nThe Jews are numerous in the vicinity of Cochin, but their chief place of residence is Mattacherry, about a mile distant from that town, which is almost wholly inhabited by Jews. The resident Jews (for these are from all parts of Asia) are divided into two classes; the Jerusalem, or white Jews, and the ancient, or black Jews. The latter have a synagogue in the town of Cochin, but the great body of this tribe inhabit the interior of the province, where it is difficult to distinguish the black Jew from the Hindoo, their appearance is so similar. Their principal towns are Tritoor, Paroor, Chenotta, and Maleh, and by the white Jews they are considered an inferior race.\n\nThe Cochin Rajah maintained his independence to a much later period than most of the other Hindoo chiefs. He was compelled by Tipu to pay tribute, which he now does to the Company. Mutta Tambran, Rajah of Cochin, died in 1787, of the small-pox, and was succeeded by his younger brother, Virulam Tambran. The following places, and some other towns, belong to this prince, viz. Naharica, Condanada, Perinanoor, Angicaimal, Udiamper, Mullaventurutti, Pallicare, Cenotta, Ceovare, Pucotta, Arshitanichery, and Puttenchera.\n\nOn the 6th Jan. 1791, a treaty was concluded with the Rajah of Cochin, to enable him to throw off his subjection to Tipu, and transfer his allegiance to the East India Company, and recover certain districts which the Sultan had usurped from him. In consequence of this arrangement he agreed to pay the Company one lack of rupees annually as a tributary.\n\nOn the 6th May, 1809, in consequence of some occurrences in the Cochin territory, which rendered it expedient that new engagements should be concluded, a treaty of perpetual friendship with the rajah was completed by Colonel Macaulay on the part of the British government. By the conditions of this treaty the friends and enemies of either of the contracting parties are to be considered as the friends and enemies of both, the British undertaking to defend and protect the rajah's territories against all enemies. In consideration of this stipulation, the rajah agreed to pay annually, in addition to the former subsidy of one lack, a sum equal to the expense of one battalion of native infantry, or 1,76,037 rupees, making an aggregate annual payment of 2,76,037 rupees.\n\nBy additional articles, the rajah engages to exclude all Europeans not approved of by the British government from his service and country, and to give the British troops free access to his forts and towns; and to transfer the entire management of his external political relations to the British. (F. Buchanan, C. Buchanan, Treaties, &c.)\n\nCochin.\u2014A town, situated on the Malabar Coast, the capital of a province of the same name, 170 miles, N.W. from Cape Comorin. Lat. 9\u00b0 57'. Long. 76\u00b0 8'. E. In 1503 Albuquerque obtained leave to erect a fort at Cochin, which was the first possessed by the Portuguese in India. In 1663 it was taken by the Dutch, who converted the cathedral to a warehouse. While the Dutch Company possessed Cochin it was a place of very extensive commerce, and inhabited by Jew, Hindoo, and Mahommedan merchants. The intercourse with Arabia was very great,\nand Venetian sequins, brought from Egypt, were in circulation. Many of the Arab ships made two voyages annually.\n\nA considerable traffic is still carried on with Surat, Bombay, the Coasts of Malabar and Canara, and also with Arabia, China, and the Eastern Islands. The principal imports from these places are almonds, dates, pearls, gum arabic, piece goods, cotton, opium, shawls, benzoin, camphor, cinnamon and spices, sugar candy, tea, china, and silks. The chief exports are pepper, cardamums, teak wood, sandal wood, cocoa nuts, coir cordage, cassia, and fish maws.\n\nIn India this place is known by the name of Cacha Bunder, or Harbour. Ships can lie at anchor in safety on the north-east side of Cochin, where the river joins the sea. In 1800 ship-building here cost about 14l. per ton, coppered and equipped for sea in the European manner.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Bishop of Cochin now resides at Coilan. His diocese begins southward of Cochin, and extends towards Negapatam, including the Island of Ceylon, and comprehending above 100 churches. (C. Buchanan, Fra. Pao'o, F. Buchanan, Bruce, Cox, Wilford, Dow; &c. &c.)\n\nCOCHIN CHINA.\n\nA kingdom, situated in the southeastern extremity of Asia, usually distinguished by the name of India beyond the Ganges, and extending from the 9th to the 18th degrees of north latitude. On the north it is bounded by Tungquin; on the south by the Province of Siampa; on the east by the Sea of China; and on the west by the unexplored regions of Laos and Cambodia. Cochin China Proper is only a stripe of land between the sea, and the mountains of very unequal breadth; the mountains in some parts approaching within a few miles of the shore, but the whole territories of the Cochian Chinese empire are very extensive, and in 1792 were estimated to contain 95,000 square miles.\n\nAlmost all the provinces forming these dominions are separated by chains of mountains, and are inhabited by distinct tribes and nations, although subject to the same sovereign. A mountainous ridge, extending north and south, separate Tungquin and Cochin China from Laetho, Laos, and Cambodia. Another chain, running nearly parallel, separate the three latter states from Siam and China, gradually diminishing in height as they approach the south, finishing at the southern extremity of Cambodia.\n\nThe names given by Europeans to the countries lying between the 9th and 23rd degrees of north latitude, are totally unknown to the natives, except Tungquin, who distinguish this region by three grand divisions south of Tungquin. The first, betwixt the 9th and 12th degrees of latitude, is called Donuai, the chief town of which is Saigong; the second, extending to the 15th degree, is named Chang, the capital Quin-nong; and the third, between this and the 17th degree, where Tungquin commences, is called Hue, the chief town Foosan. These divisions, collectively, are named Anam.\n\nThe low lands in Cochin China produce rice, areca nut, betel leaf, tobacco, coarse cinnamon, cotton, and sugar, the last of which may be considered the staple commodity of the country. Gold dust, aquila wood, pepper, wax, honey, and ivory, are brought down by the inhabitants of the mountains. There are two species of rice\u2014that which requires inundation, and mountain rice. September, October, and November are the season of the rains.\n\nThe lands in Cochin China generally produce two crops of rice per annum, one of which is reaped in April, and the other in October. Fruits of various kinds, such as oranges, bananas, figs, pine apples,\nguavas, and pomegranates, are abundantly produced in all parts of the country.\n\nGold dust is found in their rivers, and their mines abound with ore of the purest sort. The hilts and scabbards of the swords worn by the principal officers of government are frequently adorned with it. Payments in gold were formerly made to foreign merchants in ingots, each weighing four ounces. Silver is also abundant, and has lately become the principal medium of exchange for merchandize imported, and is paid in ingots, weighing 12 ounces.\n\nThe country is very fruitful, and abounds in all tropical productions, and also many valuable articles suitable to the China market. The forests furnish a great variety of scented woods\u2014such as rose wood, scented wood, and sandal wood. The Cochin Chinese cinnamon, although of a coarse grain, and a strong pungent flavour, is preferred by the Chinese to that of Ceylon. They also export rice, sugar, pepper, areca, cardamoms, ginger, and other spices; bird nests, sea swallo, shark fins, moluscs or sea blubber, and other marine products of a gelatinous nature; which last are, at all times, in demand with the Chinese. This country also furnishes many other valuable articles, such as gum, lac, gamboge, indigo, and raw silk. In the forests of Cochin China are ebony, cedars, mimosas, walnuts, teak, iron wood and poou, and most of the other trees that grow in India.\n\nChinese goods (such as teas) might be exported here at second hand cheaper than at Canton, as by this means the duties and exactions would be evaded, which, upon every considerable ship, loaded at that port, amount to 10,000l.\n\nUntil a few centuries after the Christian era, Cochin China formed a part of the Chinese empire, and consequently the appearance of the natives, many of the customs, the written language, the religious opinions and ceremonies, are still retained by them. The countenances of the peasants are lively and intelligent; and the women, who appear more numerous than the men, are actively employed in works of husbandry. In some of the provinces of China women are condemned to the degrading and laborious task of dragging the plough; in Cochin China it is, likewise, their fate to be doomed to those occupations, which require the most persevering industry. In towns the women serve as agents or brokers to merchants from foreign countries, and act with remarkable fidelity. Both sexes are generally coarse featured, and their colour nearly as deep as that of the Malays; and the universal practice of chewing betel, with other ingredients, by reddening the lips, and blackening the teeth, gives them a most unseemly appearance. Rice, made palatable with salt and pepper, furnishes their principal meals, animal food being but sparingly used. Their small breed of cattle supply but little milk, but this article, like the Chinese, they seldom use, not even as food for their young children; nor is milking any animal customary. This is one of the countries where elephants serve for food, and is considered as a dainty. Buffaloe is preferred to other beef. During the famines, caused by the civil wars, which long desolated the country, it is said human flesh was sometimes sold in the markets of the capital.\n\nThe better part of the Cochin Chinese wear, next the skin, vests and trousers of slight silk or cotton. Turbans are frequently worn by the men, and hats sometimes by the women; shoes are not used by either sex. The men usually wear their hair twisted into a knot, and fixed on the crown of the head, which was the ancient fashion among the Chinese, who now only wear a little lock of hair behind. The handles of their officers' swords are of silver, and generally well finished, but all arts and manufactures languish,\nowing to the insecurity of property.\n\nThe particular branch of the arts in which the Cochin Chinese excel is naval architecture. Their row-gallies for pleasure are remarkably fine vessels, from 50 to 80 feet in length, and are sometimes composed of five single planks each, extending from one extremity to the other. The edges are morticed, kept tight by wooden pins, and bound firm by twisted fibres of the bamboo, without ribs or timbers of any kind. Their foreign traders are built on the same plan as the Chinese junks.\n\nThe Anam language is that of Cochin China and Tungquin. It is represented by the missionaries to be likewise generally used in Siampa and Cambodia. The Anam language and nation are often denominated Jnan by Malays and Siamese. In this kingdom all who pretend to distinction in learning, greatly affect the Chinese literature and character.\n\nThe Anam, or Cochin Chinese language is simple, original, and monosyllabic, and has neither genders, numbers, nor cases; moods, tenses, nor conjugations: all of which are supplied by the use of particles, and the junta position of words, as in the other monosyllabic languages. Conversation is a species of chant or recitative, as in the Chinese and other monosyllabic dialects, which has at first a very ludicrous effect to an ear unaccustomed to it. The intonation or accent of the Anam is very similar to the Chinese.\n\nThe religion of the Cochin Chinese is a modification of the widely-extended doctrines of Buddha, but more simple than that which is popularly practiced in China. The natives are extremely superstitious, and their devotional exercises, like those of the Chinese, are more frequently performed to avert an ideal evil, than with the hope of acquiring a positive good. Besides the spontaneous offerings which individuals make on various occasions, a yearly contribution is levied by the government, and paid for the support of a certain number of monasteries, in which the priests invoke the deity for the public welfare.\n\nThe ancient history of Cochin China is very little known, but the accounts are tolerably authentic from 1774, when the reigning family were expelled from Quinnong, the capital, by three brothers, who divided the country among them. The eldest brother was a wealthy merchant, the second a general officer, and the third a priest. When the revolt took place, the young prince, Caung Shung, with the queen and his family, by the assistance of a French missionary, named Adran, escaped into a forest, where they lay concealed for some time. After various unsuccessful attempts against the usurpers, he was compelled to fly, first to Pulowai, a desert island in the Gulf of Siam, and afterwards to Siam, from whence also he was expelled. The missionary, Adran, in the mean time proceeded with his eldest son to France, to endeavour to procure assistance, which was frustrated by the breaking out of the Revolution.\n\nCaung Shung, after remaining two years on the Island of Pulowai, feeding on roots, and sustaining many hardships, ventured to land on his own country, in 1790, from whence he at length managed to expel the successors of the original usurpers, and afterwards effected the conquest of Tungquin. In 1797 and 1798, with the assistance of the missionary, Adran, who had returned from Europe, he began many improvements, seldom attempted by Asiatic governments. He established a manufactory of saltpetre, opened roads of communication, and encouraged cultivation. He distributed his land forces into regular regiments, and established military schools, where officers were instructed in the doctrine of projectiles and gunnery by European masters. Adran had translated into the Chi-\ninese language a system of military tactics, for the use of his army. In the course of two years he constructed at least 300 large gun boats, or row gallies, five huggers, and a frigate on the model of an European vessel. He caused a system of naval tactics to be introduced, and had his officers instructed in the use of signals. He also undertook to reform the system of jurisprudence, and sent missions into the mountainous districts in the west of the kingdom, which he wished to bring into a state of civilization. These mountaineers are the people whom the Chinese designate by the appellation of men with tails, although, in all probability, they are the original inhabitants of this empire. He openly declared his great veneration for the Christian religion, which he tolerates, and indeed all others in his dominions; but he still adheres to the ancient religion of his own country. In 1800, the missionary, Adran, died, and was interred with all the pomp and ceremonies prescribed by the Cochin Chinese religion. In this year King Caung Shung's military forces were as follows:\n\n| ARMY. | Men. |\n|-------|------|\n| 24 squadrons of buffalo troops | 6,000 |\n| 16 battalions of elephants (200 animals) | 8,000 |\n| 30 regiments of artillery | 15,000 |\n| 24 regiments, 1200 each, trained in the European manner | 30,000 |\n| Infantry, with matchlocks, trained in the ancient manner of the country | 42,000 |\n| Guards regularly trained in European tactics | 12,000 |\n\nLand forces 113,000\n\nMARINE.\n\nArtificers in the naval arsenal | 8,000 |\nSailors registered and born on the ships in the harbour | 8,000 |\n\nCarried forward 16,000\n\nBrought forward 16,000\nAttached to the European built vessels - - - - - 1,200\nAttached to the junks - - 1,600\nAttached to 100 row gallies 8,000\n\n26,800\nLand forces 113,000\n\nTotal 139,800\n\nIn the year 1806 this king was in his 50th year.\n\nTwo attempts have been made by the East India Company to open an intercourse with Cochin China; one in 1778 by Mr. Hastings, and one in 1804 by an envoy from Canton; but both proved unsuccessful. The last found the sovereign Caung Shung completely surrounded by Frenchmen; and, as he knew not the language of the country, and had not any one with him who did, every proposition he had to offer, and every explanation regarding his mission, were necessarily made through the French missionaries; the result was the complete failure of the mission.\n\nThe political system of this government, like that of all the countries of India beyond the Ganges, is one of extreme caution and aversion to any intimate connexion with strangers. The pretensions of China to the kingdom of Tanguin, formerly tributary to that empire, are incessantly to be guarded against; but while the Cochin Chinese sovereign supports his present respectable military force, and perseveres in his improved system of government, he has little to fear from any of his immediate neighbours, who, besides the Chinese, are the Siamese and Malays.\n\nIn all the more recent wars between Cochin Chinese monarch and the Chinese, the latter have been uniformly discomfited by the superior valour and discipline of the troops of the former. With respect to the Europeans, now that their assistance is no longer required, they are kept at a distance or under complete re-\nCODAPAHAR.\u2014A town in the Bundelcund district, 25 miles N. N.

E.\n\nCOIMBETTOOR, (Coiamaturu).\u2014A small province above the Ghauts, in the south of India, situated between the 10th and 12th degrees of north latitude. It is bounded on the north by the Mysore; on the south by Dinigul; on the east by Salem and Kistnagerry; and on the west by the Malabar province. This district is divided into North and South Coimbetoor, but both subordinate to the collectorship.\n\nIn North Coimbetoor, near Mulin and Colcagala, the cultivation is equal to any in India, and consists chiefly of rice fields, watered by large reservoirs. The summit of the Eastern Ghauts, in this quarter, are from 1500 to 2000 feet above the level of the upper country, which is here very beautiful, and in a better state of cultivation than the Mysore. The tanks are numerous, but mostly in ruins; and, although fertile, this part of the province is but thinly inhabited, and the hills produce but little timber. In this mountainous district there are two rainy seasons. The first is in the month following the vernal equinox, and the second lasts the two months before, and the two months after the autumnal equinox. The people in this neighbourhood consider the ox as a living god, who gives them their bread; and in every village there are one or two bulls, to whom monthly or weekly worship is performed, and when one of them dies he is buried with great ceremony.\n\nFrom Candbully to Mahhully, in North Coimbetoor, much of the country has been formerly cultivated, but is now nearly waste. In the rainy season the Palar River here contains a great deal of water. The strata of the Ghauts in this quarter run north and south, and are vertical. Being much intersected with fissures, they are of little use in building.\n\nNear to the town of Coimbetoor the soil is in general good, and tolerably clear of rocks and stones. The hedges are few, and the country remarkably bare of trees. In this neighbourhood all kinds of soil are cultivated for gardens, and the variety occasions some difference in their value; but the depth below the surface, at which the water stands, is the chief cause of the variation of the rent. In some gardens the water is within eight cubits of the surface; in others, so deep as 18. Many sheep are bred through Coimbetoor, especially in the Aranasi division. The hills west of Coimbetoor are inhabited by the Malasir, Mudugar, Erilgarn, and Todcar castes.\n\nThe bagait, or gardens watered by machines, called capily and yatam, are of great importance in this region, as this mode of cultivation enables a small extent of ground to support many persons, and to pay a high rent; it is also less liable to fail for want of rain. Taking the whole province of Coimbetoor together, the average of the wet cultivation is little more than three per cent. of the total cultivation.\n\nIn South Coimbetoor the rice grounds along the banks of the Amaravati are extensive, and fully cultivated; further on the soil becomes poor, has many large projecting rocks, and but few enclosures.\n\nThroughout the Coimbetoor province there are earths impregnated with muriatic salts, and others with nitrates, both of which have occa-\nsionally been made into culinary salts and nitre. This earth seems to contain nitre ready formed, as no potash is added to it by the makers. Much of the well water has a saline taste.\n\nThe inhabitants of Coimbetoor appear to be as far behind those of Mysore in intelligence and most of the arts, as these are behind the natives of Madras and Calcutta. As is the case in every part of Bengal, where arts have not been introduced by foreigners, the only one that has been carried to tolerable perfection is that of weaving. In this province the Vaylalar are a numerous tribe of the Tamul race, and esteemed of pure Sudra caste.\n\nThe province of Coimbetoor, in remote times, was named Kanjiam, and came under the dominion of the Mysore rajahs about 160 years ago. It now forms one of the collectorships under the Madras presidency, having been acquired by the East India Company in 1799; but it still contains a great deal of uncultivated land, and has not yet been permanently assessed for the revenue. (F. Buchanan, 5th Report, Hodson, &c.)\n\nCOIMBETOROOR.\u2014A town in the province of Coimbetoor, of which it is the capital. Lat. 10\u00b0 55'. N. Long. 77\u00b0 6'. E.\n\nThis city suffered much by the frequent wars betwixt the British and Mysore sovereigns; but is recovering rapidly, and contains above 2000 houses; in Hyder's time is said to have contained twice as many. There is here a mosque, built by Tippoo, who sometimes made Coimbetoor the place of his residence; and it is also the head-quarters of a regiment of native cavalry. The exports from hence are tobacco, cotton wool, thread, cloth, sugar, jaggery, capsicums, onions, betel leaf, and jiva and danga, two carminative seeds. In the neighbourhood of Perura, two miles from Coimbetoor, both culinary salt and salt-petre are procured by lixiviating the soil. At Topumbetta, about five miles north from Coimbetoor, iron is smelted from black sand. Cotton, both raw and spun, is exported in considerable quantities to the Malabar province.\n\nAt Perura is a celebrated temple, dedicated to Mahadeva, and called Mail (high) Chittumbra, to distinguish it from another Chittumbra, near to Pondicherry. The idol is said to have placed itself here many years ago; but it is only 3000 years since the temple was erected over it by a Rajah of Madura. The building is highly ornamented after the Hindoo fashion; but the whole is utterly destitute of elegance. The figures are not only extremely rude, but some of them are indecent. When Tippoo issued a general order for the destruction of all idolatrous buildings, he excepted only this and the temples of Mailcotta and Seringapatam.\n\nThe hereditary chief of Coimbetoor is of the Vaylalar tribe; the present, by his own account, being the 20th in descent from the founder of the town. The family originally paid tribute to the Rajahs of Madura. In the year 1783 Coimbetoor was taken from Tippoo by the southern army, but restored at the peace in 1784. In the war of 1790 it was early taken possession of by the British troops, but afterwards besieged by those of Tippoo, who were repulsed, in an attempt to storm it, by a weak garrison under Lieutenant Chalmers. Subsequently it surrendered to Cummer ud Deen Khan, Tippoo's general; and the garrison, in breach of a capitulation, detained prisoners until the general peace in 1792. Along with the province it came into the final possession of the British in 1799.\n\nTravelling distance from Madras, 306 miles; from Seringapatam, 122 miles. (F.

E.\nCOLAIR LAKE.\u2014The bed of this lake is situated five miles to the south of Ellore, in the Northern Circars, and extends 47 miles in length from west to east, and 14 in breadth from north to south. From the beginning of the rains in July, until the end of September, the whole is overspread with water, excepting 60 or 70 small islets, in which the inhabitants remain; but, during the rest of the year, the whole is dry and passable, and in many places highly cultivated. The lake is chiefly formed by the overflowings of the Krishna and Godavary; and its waters are conducted into many channels, to irrigate the circumjacent territory. (Orme, J. Grant, 5th Report, &c.)\n\nCOLAIRCOTTA.\u2014A town in the Northern Circars, district of Ellore, 35 miles north from Masulipatam, and situated on the borders of the Colair Lake.

This town contains above 1000 houses, many of which are inhabited by Tamil weavers, who import their cotton from Coimbatore. The environs of this place are very beautiful. The high mountains to the south pour down cascades of a prodigious height; and the corn fields are intermixed with lofty forests and plantations of fruit trees. The cultivation, however, is but very poor, and the quantity of rice land small. Here the rain, without the assistance of art, is able to bring one cup of rice to maturity. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nCOLAPOOR, (Calapoor).\u2014A small independent Maharatta state, on the sea coast of the province of Bejaapor, named in the maps Bonsoho. It is bounded to the south by the Portuguese territory of Goa; to the eastward and northward by the Peshwa's dominions; and to the west by the sea. The Colapoor Rajah gained a great deal of country by usurpation and conquest, during the confusion in the Maharatta Peshwa's dominions, after the death of Sewai Madhoorow, particularly from his neighbours the Putwurdum family, although he was only at war with one branch of it, (Appah Saheb's). Among the Maharattas such usurpations are not thought incompatible with friendship and the relations of peace and amity. The principal seaports are Raree and Vingorla.\n\nThe hatred borne to the Colapoor Rajah by Appah Saheb is of the most implacable nature. When his father, Purseram Bhow, was taken, mortally wounded, he was carried prisoner to the rajah, who ordered the old man (a Brahmin) to be cut to pieces in his presence. This act of atrocity Appah Sahab declared he would never forgive or forget, and that he would most willingly sacrifice all he had in the world, and retire to Benares, and pass the rest of his life in obscurity, if he could revenge the death of his father, which it does not appear he ever effected. Notwithstanding this feud, a cessation of hostilities was effected by the interposition of the British government, and particularly by the great weight of Gen. Wellesley's (the Duke of Wellington) name.\n\nIn 1804, in consequence of the piracies committed by the Rajah of Colapoor's subjects, his ports were blockaded, and payment demanded of the money due to the Company and to the British merchants at Bombay. During the time of war, the cruiser stationed on the coast was never of sufficient strength to fight one of the enemy's privateers, on which account, to avoid the disgraceful event of her capture, Gen. Wellesley recommended a treaty to be entered into with the rajah, which, if he afterwards broke, it would afford ample ground to the British government to get rid effectually of an evil, which in the existing state of its power was not creditable. The rajah was also in the habit of attacking the possessions of our ally, the Peshwa, in the province of Beja-\npoor, held by the southern Jaghire-\n\nAt the same period of time Viswas Row Ghantky and Serjee Row Ghantky, two of the most persevering depredators, took refuge with the Colapoor Rajah, after their banditti had been defeated and dispersed by Gen. Wellesley. The general, in consequence, in March, 1804, addressed a letter to the rajah, informing him that he was perfectly aware of the family connexion between the rajah and those brothers, and that it was not the custom of the British government, nor his own wish, to perpetuate enmities, or deprive those of an asylum, who were inclined to live in peace; for which reason he did not call on the rajah to give up the brothers, as he might be justified in doing. At the same time he notified to the rajah, that, as he had given them an asylum, the British government would consider him responsible for their conduct; and that, if they again assembled troops, which could only be intended to disturb the peace of other powers, he (the rajah) would be called upon to answer for the injuries they might do, of which this notification was a friendly warning. He added, \"It is time that the nations of India should enjoy some peace; and you may depend upon it, that the British government will not suffer it to be wantonly disturbed with impunity.\"\n\nThis letter, as may be anticipated, had the desired effect, and the adjacent territories have since enjoyed a tranquillity unknown for ages. (MSS. Malet, &c.)\n\nColar.\u2014A district in the eastern extremity of the Mysore Rajah's territories, situated between the 13th and 14th degrees of north latitude.\n\nThe proportion of land that has never been cultivated between Baydanangalum and Tayculum appears to be four-tenths of the whole, of which the greater part consists of high rocky hills. Those towards Colar are very extensive, the road approaching it from the east being between two immense piles of bare granite, crumbling into fragments, that roll down into the plain. These hills occupy three-fourths of the land, which has never been ploughed, the remainder is covered with copse wood. The nakedness of the country does not proceed from any natural incapacity in the soil to produce trees. The tamarind, pipal, mango, and robinia mitis, thrive well. The villages have a miserable appearance, the houses being entirely hidden by the surrounding walls, which present nothing to the view but a brown dusty mud.\n\nIn some low moist parts of this district salt is made, during the dry season, by scraping off the surface of the earth, and collecting it in heaps, from which the salt is extracted. The grain of the salt is large, and consists of well-formed tubes, mixed with much earthy impurity. The natives in Colar plant many aloes (agave vivipara) in their hedges, and use the leaves for making cordage. In the country round Colar the irrigated land is watered entirely from reservoirs. Rich men build them to acquire a reputation, and are allowed a certain profit also, according to the extent of land they irrigate.\n\nGold dust is found in various parts of this district, particularly nine miles east of Boodicotta, at a village named Marcoopum. The area of the country, impregnated with gold, is estimated at 130 square miles. The prevalent language about Tayculum is the Karnataca, called by the English the Canarese. (F. Buchanan, 6th Register, &c.)\n\nColar.\u2014A town in the Rajah of Mysore's territories, the capital of a district of the same name, 40 miles E. N. E. from Bangaloor. Lat. 13\u00b0 8' N. Long. 75\u00b0 19' E.\n\nThis town has a strong mud fort with two very lofty walls, and in the town a cavalier of stone, that rises high above them. It contains above 700 houses, many of which are inhabited by weavers. Colar was the birth place of Hyder. His son,\nTippoo, erected a handsome monument for him, and near it a mosque and college of Moolahs or Mahomedan priests, with a proper establishment of musicians, were endowed to pray for his soul; the whole of which is still continued at the expense of the British government.\n\nThe gardens here, besides the usual fruits, contain cabbages, artichokes, and grapes. The trade and manufactures of Colar were entirely ruined by Tippoo, it being in the immediate vicinity of his enemies dominions, with whom he would allow no communication whatever. Both are now rapidly on the increase. On a hill north from the town, was formerly a hill fort, in which for some time resided Cossim Khan, the General of Aurengzebe; who, towards the end of the 17th century, made the first regular Mahomedan establishment in this quarter of the Upper Carnatic.

In the surrounding country coarse baftas and cossacs of an excellent quality are manufactured, remarkable for the weight of raw material they contain.\n\nCOLLARASS.\u2014A town in the province of Agra, district of Narwar, 48 miles S. W. from the city of Narwar. Lat. 25\u00b0. 13'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 42'. E. This place is surrounded by an old stone wall of no strength, near to which is a large nullah of fine water. The country to the north is jungly, thinly inhabited, much intersected by ravines; and except in the immediate vicinity of the Sinde River, is during the dry season very ill supplied with water. (MSS. \u00a7v.)\n\nCOLLEGAL PETTAH.\u2014A town in the province of Coimbetoor, 31 miles E. S. E. from Seringapatam. Lat. 12\u00b0. 13'. N. Long. 77. 14'. E. This place contains about 600 houses, and has two large temples. It is a mart for the traders between Seringapatam and the country below the Ghauts, near the Cavery. In the surrounding country there are above 40 reservoirs, mostly in want of repair. The soil is generally red and fit for the cultivation of ragy and cotton; the neighbourhood also contains a few sandal wood trees. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nCOLNA, (Khalana).\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Jessore, 83 miles N. E. from Calcutta. Lat. 25\u00b0. 11'. N. Long. 89\u00b0. 38'.

At the point of separation, the southern branch is 20 feet higher than the Coleroon, which latter is allowed to run waste. This river formerly divided the southern districts from the immediate possessions of the Nabob of Arcot.\n\nCOLUMBO.\u2014The capital of Ceylon and seat of government, is situated on the south-west part of the island. Lat. 7\u00b0. 2'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 50'. E. The fort is placed on a peninsula\nprojecting into the sea, and is upwards of a mile in circumference, and strong both by nature and art. There is no hill in the neighbourhood sufficiently high to command it, and there are but few places where boats can safely land. On the south side the surf runs so high, and the shore is so rocky, that it would be dangerous to approach it. On the west side of the bay, where the sea is smoother, it is strongly defended by batteries. The ramparts of the fort are very strong, having eight principal bastions, and there are a number of lesser ones with curtains, banquets, and parapets, communicating with each other all round the fort; but, the want of bomb proof casements, is a considerable disadvantage.\n\nThe whole fort is surrounded by a broad and deep wet ditch. Adjoining to the covert way, and at the foot of the glacis, is a lake extending three and four miles into the country. For near a mile on the outside of the fort, the neck of land which connects it with the country is not above 5 or 600 yards broad; and in the middle of this space lies the lake, leaving only room on each side for a narrow causeway. Near to the glacis it may be entirely cut off by opening the sluices, and cutting the road across, when the lake would be connected with the sea, and the garrison completely insulated. In the centre of the lake is an island, called by the Dutch, Slave Island; which is a remarkably pleasant spot, and here a battalion of Malays is usually stationed.\n\nThe plan of the city of Columbo is regular, and nearly divided into four quarters by two principal streets, which cross each other, and extend the whole length of the town. To these smaller ones run parallel, with connecting lanes betwixt them. At the foot of the ramparts on the inside is a broad street or way, which goes wholly round the fort.\n\nColumbo is built more in the European style than most garrisons in India. The Dutch houses are all regularly built, though few of them are above one story high. An Englishman is surprised to find all the windows here having panes of glass, in place of venetian blinds and shutters. The natives of Holland prefer having their houses shut up both in the hot and cold season; while the British wish to have them open, in order that the air be freely admitted. Before each house and connected with it, is a large open veranda, supported by wooden pillars, to protect the body of the house from the sun.\n\nThe water in the wells of the town is of a brackish quality, and unfit to drink. The Europeans belonging to the civil and military establishments, are supplied from springs about a mile from the fort.\n\nThe harbour of Columbo which lies on the west side, is nothing more than an open road, affording good and safe anchorage for ships for only four months, from December to April. During this period, the N.W. winds, to which this road is much exposed, do not prevail to any violent degree; but, about May, when the monsoon sets in on the Malabar coast, and extends its ravages to the west of Ceylon, the roads of Columbo no longer afford any protection. This city is consequently cut off from any intercourse by sea with the rest of the island, for two thirds of the year. For six mouths of the year this side of Ceylon is subject to extremely heavy falls of rain, accompanied with thunder and lightning, and violent winds blowing on shore. During this season the variations of the climate are excessively great, which much distresses the sepoys and other natives of the continent. On account of the violence and duration of the rains, Ceylon is often called the watering pot of India.\n\nAlthough Trincomalee, on account of its harbour and situation, is of more consequence for the nation to retain, yet Columbo is in every other\nrespect the superior. The number of its inhabitants is much greater, its fort and block town are larger; the country where it is situated is much more fertile, and the district depending on it much wider, being not less than 60 miles in length, by 10 in breadth.\n\nThe fort of Columbo being extensive, and the outworks and detached works numerous, a strong garrison is required to defend it. Three or four battalions of Europeans and sepoys are usually stationed here. Columbo was singularly unfortunate in losing its three first British governors within the space of one year. Col. Petrie and General Doyle died, and Col. Bonnevaux of the Company's service was killed, by the upsetting of his curricule. The Pettah or black town of Columbo deserves particular notice, on account of its extent and structure. In the street next to the sea is an excellent fish market, well supplied from the sea, lakes, and rivers in the neighbourhood; fish being a considerable part of the food of the inhabitants. On the rivers in the vicinity of Columbo there are nearly 300 flat-bottomed boats moored, with entire families on board, who reside permanently in them, having no other dwellings.\n\nColumbo for its size is one of the most populous places in India, being estimated to contain above 50,000 inhabitants, who are a great mixture of almost every race of Asiatics. The language most universally spoken both by Europeans and Asiatics, who resort to Columbo, is the Portuguese of India, a base corrupt dialect, differing much from that spoken in Portugal.\n\nFrom this district a large quantity of cinnamon and pepper, the staple spices of the island, are annually transported to Europe, in vessels which touch here from Bengal and Madras. A great deal of arrack is made in the neighbourhood of Columbo, and the other districts along the west coast. A large quantity of coir rope is made here, and a number of interior articles, such as betel leaf, areka nut, jaggery, cocoanuts and oil, honey, bees-wax, cardamums, coral, ivory, fruit, and a variety of lesser articles; the whole amount seldom exceeding 80,000l. annually.\n\nIn return they import grain, coarse cotton cloths, calicoes, coarse muslins, handkerchiefs, palampores, stockings, China ware, tin, copper, and a variety of toys; also homelooses, a species of fish peculiar to Bombay, and onions from the same place, where they are remarkably good. The Dutch levied a duty of five per cent. on all these exports and imports, which is still continued by our government; but the aggregate of both in 1862 was less than 20,000l. of which sum more than one half was paid on betel nut exported.\n\nIn general every year towards February, a Portuguese or Chinese ship arrives from Macao with teas, sugar, candied sweetmeats, hams, silks, velvets, nankeens, umbrellas, straw hats, all kinds of China ware and toys. As these articles are generally paid for in cash, they occasion a great deal of hard money to leave the island. Accounts are kept in rix dollars, a nominal coin, like the British pound sterling, and valued at a certain quantity of copper money. A rix dollar, or copper rupee (as the English term it), goes for about 2s. sterling; four of them are equivalent to a star pagoda, a gold coin worth about 8s. sterling. Every thing in Ceylon is generally dearer than on the continent of India, from whence most of the articles in use are imported. Horses and servants are particularly expensive. The native Ceylonese make but indifferent servants, and are totally ignorant of the management of horses.\n\nBeef, fish, and fowl in particular, are both cheap and plentiful at Columbo. Mutton is excessively dear, as no sheep can be reared in the vicinity, it being only at Jaffna-\npatam where they have ever been pastured with success. Pigs and ducks are reared in abundance, but not in the most cleanly manner. Geese are rare, and turkeys not to be had, unless a few imported occasionally by ships from other parts of India.\n\nThe country for several miles round Columbo is flat and very rich. It is diversified with fields of rice and pasture, and intersected by a number of small lakes, rivers, and canals. One of the chief beauties in the neighbourhood of Columbo is the immense number of cinnamon trees. In the gardens they are regularly cultivated with the greatest success, but in the woods they grow wild. In 1656 the town and fortress of Columbo was taken from the Portuguese by the Dutch, in whose possession it remained until 1796, when it was captured by the British, and subsequently ceded, with the rest of the island, at the Peace of Amiens. (Percival, Milburn, &c.)\n\nCOMBOOCONAM.\u2014A town in the province of Tanjore, 20 miles N. N. E. from the city of Tanjore. Lat. 11\u00b0. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 25'. E.\n\nThis was the ancient capital of the Chola race, one of the most ancient Hindoo dynasties of which any traces have been discovered in the southern regions, and from which, in latter times, the whole Coast of Cholamundul (Coromandel) has taken its name. There are still remains indicating its ancient splendour. At present it is chiefly inhabited by Brahmins, whose habitations appear neat, and the district thriving. Some of the tanks and pagodas are very fine; but it is remarkable, that almost invariably the outer gate of the pagoda is of superior dimensions to the temple itself. The surrounding country is rich, and in a high state of cultivation.\n\nCOMBUMPADOO.\u2014A district in the Nizam's territories, in the province of Hyderabad, situated betwixt the 17th and 18th degrees of north latitude.\n\nCOMBEUMPADOO.\u2014A town belonging to the Nizam, in the province of Hyderabad, the capital of a district of the same name, and situated 80 miles east of the city of Hyderabad.

E. The East India Company have long had a commercial residence here, for the purchase of piece goods.\n\nCOMMIM, (Commun).\u2014A district in the Balaghat ceded territories, situated among the Eastern Ghats, betwixt the 15th and 16th degrees of north latitude. It has no rivers of any magnitude, but many mountain streams, the surface of the country being irregular and mountainous.\n\nCOMMIM.\u2014A town in the Balaghat ceded territories, 73 miles N. from Cudapah, and the capital of a district of the same name. Lat. 15\u00b0. 31'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 55'. E.\n\nCOMERY.\u2014A small town in the province of Tinnevelly, 43 miles S. W. from Madura. Lat. 9\u00b0. 18'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 31'.

E.\n\nCOMOBO.\u2014An island in the Eastern Seas, situated betwixt Sumbhawa and Floris, and the eighth and ninth degrees of north latitude. In length it may be estimated at 32 miles, by 16 the average breadth.\n\nCOMOKIN, CAPE, (Cumari).\u2014The southern extremity of the Continent of India. Lat. 7\u00b0. 57'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 35'. E.\n\nCOMTAH.\u2014A town belonging to the Nagpoor Rajah, in the province of Berar, 75 miles N. E. from the city of Nagpoor. Lat. 21\u00b0. 35'. N. Long. 80\u00b0. 49'. E.\n\nCONCAN, (Caneana).\u2014A large district in the province of Bejaapoor, situated between the 16th and 19th\ndegrees of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by the district of Ticoan; on the south by the British province of Canara; on the east by the Western Ghauts; and on the west by the sea. In length it may be estimated at 200 miles, by 40 the average breadth. In the British arrangements the southern part of the Hindoo Concan is included in the district of North Canara; but, in the Hindoo Geography of the West Coast of India, Concan begins at the River Gangawala, in Lat. 14\u00b0. 37'. N. where Haiga ends.\n\nThe surface of this country exhibits a gradual declension from the Ghauts towards the sea, and is intersected by numerous mountain streams, but no river of magnitude. There are few coasts so much broken into small bays and harbours as this, with so straight a general outline. This multitude of shallow ports, an uninterrupted view along shore, and an elevated coast favourable to distant vision, have fitted this coast for a region of piracy. The land and sea breezes on this coast, as well as on Coromandel, blow alternately in 24 hours, and divide the day; so that vessels sailing along the coast are obliged to keep in sight of land, as the land winds do not reach more than 40 miles out to sea.\n\nFrom Zyghur on the sea coast to the Ambah Pass, the country, though hilly, is rich, capable of cultivation, and tolerably well inhabited; near Ambah the mountains rise to a stupendous height, and are ascended with the utmost difficulty. This district produces the best hemp in India, which might be delivered in London at 65l. per ton.\n\nThe Brahmans, properly belonging to the Concan, are of the Paunsh Gauda, or north of India division. They alledge that they are descendants of the colony to whom the country was originally given by Parasn Rama. Their principal seat seems to have been at Goa, called by them Govay, from whence they were expelled by the Portuguese, after which they, for the most part, became traders. The Concan Brahmans are disclaimed by those of the rest of India; but they compose a large portion of the ruling characters in the Maharatta empire.\n\nThe inhabitants of this coast, from the earliest antiquity, have had a strong propensity to piracy. In the 18th century their depredations were exercised upon all ships indifferently, which did not purchase passes from the chiefs of the pirates. Conaje Angira established a government on this coast, extending 120 miles from Tamanah to Bancoote, together with the inland country as far back as the mountains, which in some places are 30, and in others not more than 20 miles from the sea-coast. His family retained this sovereignty for more than 70 years, until 1756, when they were subdued and expelled by Admiral Watson and Colonel Clive.\n\nAt present more than three-fourths of the Concan is within the dominions of the Maharatta Peshwa, to whom the petty chiefs in the district are all nominally subordinate. There is no part of the sea-coast, south from Bombay to Cape Comorin, that is not now either subject to the British government, or completely under its influence, except an inconsiderable tract of country subject to the Rajah of Colapoor, whose power is too insignificant to create any serious alarm. (P. Buchanan, Orme, Remel. Malcolm, Moor, &c.)\n\nConchon, (Canchana, Golden).\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Dinagepoor, 63 miles N. by E. from Moorshedabad. Lat. 25\u00b0. V. N. Long. 88\u00b0. 42'. E.\n\nCondatchy, (Bay of).\u2014A bay in the Island of Ceylon, about 12 miles south from the Island of Manaar, in the Gulf of Manaar, and the most central rendezvous for the boats employed in the pearl fishery. The banks where it is carried on extend several miles along the coast from Manaar southwards, off Arippo, Condatchy, and Pomparipa; and, after\nthey are surveyed, are usually let to the highest bidder. These banks are divided into three or four different portions, one of which is fished each year, to give the oysters time to attain a proper growth. The pearl oysters are supposed to arrive at their completest state of maturity in seven years; but, if left too long, the pearl is said to become so large, and so troublesome to the oyster, that it is thrown out of the shell.\n\nThe fishing season commences in February, and ends about the beginning of April; the period allowed to the merchant to fish the banks never exceeding two months. Many of the divers are of a black race, known by the name of Marawas, and inhabiting the opposite coast of Tuticorin; and, although natives of Malabar, are Roman Catholics, and leave off work on Sundays to attend chapel at Arippo. The boats and craft employed in the fishery do not belong to Ceylon, but are brought from the nearest ports of the continent. The divers from Colang are accounted the best, and are only rivalled by the Lubbeks, who remain on the island for the purpose of being trained in the art. During the season all the boats sail and return together. A signal gun is fired at Arippo, at ten o'clock at night, when the whole fleet sets sail with the land breeze; they reach the banks before day-break, and at sun-rise commence fishing. In this employment they continue until the sea-breeze, at noon, warns them to return.\n\nEach boat carries 20 men, with a tindal or chief, who acts as pilot. Ten of the men row, and assist the divers in re-ascending; the other 10 are divers, and go down five at a time. They usually remain under water two minutes, when, having collected the oysters into a net, which is hung round their neck, they make the signal, and are drawn up again. The longest time of remaining under water ever known, was that of a diver from Anjengo, in the year 1797, who remained under water six complete minutes. The chief danger to the divers is from the ground shark; to obviate which they have recourse to conjurors, or binders of sharks, who they suppose possess charms strong enough to preserve them. Government always keeps in pay some conjurers to attend the divers, and remove their fears. The divers are paid differently, according to their agreement with the boat owners. Each diver brings up about 100 oysters in his net; and, if not interrupted by any accident, will go down 50 trips in a forenoon.\n\nOyster lotteries are common here, and consist in the purchasing a quantity of oysters unopened, and taking the chance of either finding, or not finding, pearls in them. The pearls procured are of a whiter colour than those found in the Gulf of Ormus, on the Arabian coast, but, in other respects, are not accounted so pure or of so excellent a quality; for though the white pearls are more esteemed in Europe, the natives of India prefer those of a yellowish or golden cast. The workmen drill them with great dexterity, and polish them with a powder made of pearls. The farmer of the fishery, in 1797, paid between two and 300,000 pagodas, a sum nearly double the usual rent. The average clear profit is about 40,000l. per annum to government. (Percival, Le Beck, Knox, &c.)\n\nCONDAPILLY, (Canadapalli).\u2014One of the Northern Circars, situated between the 16th and 17th degrees of north latitude. Condapilly and Ellore occupy the whole of the space between the Krishna and Godavery, the districts of Masulipatam towards the sea, the inland province of Commin on the west, and the Lake of Colair, chiefly formed by the overflowings of these two rivers. The area of the whole may be estimated at 3400 miles, exclusive of the high mountainous regions on the west.\n\nBy the Mahommedans this district is named Mustapha Nagur,\nwhich is also the appellation in the revenue books. Besides the Krishna, which bounds it on the southwest, this country is watered by several smaller streams, and is, on the whole, tolerably well cultivated, but much inferior to Tanjore, or the more flourishing districts of Bengal. The principal towns are Condapilly, Reddygoodum, and Tontraveloor. There are diamond mines in Condapilly, but for many years they have been very unproductive. (J. Grant, 5th Report, Rennel, &c.)\n\nCondapilly.\u2014A town in the Northern Circars, district of Condapilly, of which it is the capital. Lat. 16\u00b0 39' N. Long. 80\u00b0 23' E. This place was formerly a fortified hill in the Indian style, of considerable strength, but the urgency no longer existing; the works have been suffered to decay, which has been the fate of innumerable native fortresses now comprehended in the British dominions. Condapilly was first conquered from the Hindoo Princes, about the year 1471, by the Bhamenee sovereigns of the Deccan, and it came into the British possession, along with the Northern Circars, in 1765.\n\nTravelling distance from Hyderabad, 142 miles; from Madras, 306; from Nagpoor, 370; and from Seringapatam, 414 miles. (J. Grant, Feirstha, Rennel, &c.)\n\nCondavir, (Conadavi).\u2014A town in the Northern Circars, district of Guntoor, strongly situated on a mountain, 15 miles west of Guntoor. Lat. 16\u00b0 10' N. Long. 80\u00b0 5' E.\n\nConkair.\u2014A town in the province of Gundwana, situated between a high rocky hill and the south bank of the Mahanuddy River, 105 miles S. by W. from Buttunpoor. On the summit of the hill is a fortress, mounting two guns. Lat. 20\u00b0 48' N. Long. 82\u00b0 15' E.\n\nThe country about Conkair is much covered with thick woods, and the town entirely surrounded by hills, inhabited by wild Goand mountaineers, this being one of the tracts originally possessed by the ancient Hindoo Rajahs of Gundwana. The frontier of the Bustar territories is 12 miles distant from Conkair, and is entered through the Tillygaunt, a very rugged and steep pass over the hills. (Bhout, &c.)\n\nConjee, (Canchi).\u2014A district in the Carnatic, now comprehended in the collectorship of Arcot, and intersected by the Palar River. The face of the country is generally flat and sandy, and towards the Ghauts but thinly inhabited. Around most of the villages the remains of a hedge, with a rampart and stone bastions at the gateway and angles, are still to be seen; but, along with the choultries, are going fast to decay. These fortifications were formerly necessary, to protect the inhabitants from Tippoo's predatory horse, who devastated the country, and forced away the peasantry. In this district the chief supply of water for agriculture is derived from tanks and reservoirs. (Lord Valentia, &c.)\n\nConjeveram, (Canchipurra, the Golden City).\u2014A town of considerable size in the Carnatic, 46 miles S. W. from Madras. Lat. 12\u00b0 48' N. Long. 79\u00b0 45' E. The streets at this place are wide, and cross each other at right angles, with a range of cocoa nut trees on each side. The houses have mud walls, and are roofed with tiles. The tanks are lined with stone, and in good repair; and the whole town has the appearance of prosperity.\n\nThe principal entrance to the great pagoda is lofty, and resembles, in its shape and ornaments, that at Tanjore. On the left, after passing through it, is a large edifice like a choultry, which the Brahmins assert contains 1000 pillars. Many of them are handsomely carved with figures of Hindoo deities, and several of the groups composed with considerable skill. The sides of the steps leading up to it are formed by two well-carved elephants drawing a car.\n\nThe second court, or inner square, being considered of great sanctity,\nstrangers are not admitted into it. This temple is dedicated to Mahadeva. The view from the top of the great gateway is uncommonly fine, consisting of extensive woods, intersected by a large sheet of water, with numerous pagodas rising among the trees, and a magnificent range of mountains at a distance. The surrounding country is in general level, but the soil bad; consisting chiefly of coarse sand, apparently originating from decomposed granite. (Lord Valentia, Salt, &c.)\n\nContanagur, (Cantinagara).\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Dinagepoor, 112 miles N. by E. from Moorsheadabad. Lat. 25\u00b0. 46'. N. Long. 88\u00b0. 34'. E.\n\nConlass.\u2014A district belonging to the Nizam, in the province of Beeder, situated about the 18th degree of north latitude.\n\nCooloo.\u2014A mountainous and woody district in the province of Lahore, situated between the 33rd and 34th degrees of north latitude. It has the Sutulije River to the east, and the Ravey to the west, and is nearly divided in two by the Beyah River.\n\nCooloo, (or Raghnathpura).\u2014A town in the province of Lahore, district of Cooloo, situated on the east side of the Bengal River, 155 miles N. E. from the city of Lahore. Lat. 33\u00b0. 20'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 48'. E.\n\nCooloo.\u2014A town belonging to independent zemindars in the province of Orissa, 90 miles W. by N. from Cuttack. Lat. 20\u00b0. 40'. N. Long. 84\u00b0. 40'. E.\n\nCooloo.\u2014A town in the province of Cuttack, situated on the south side of the Mahanuddy River, 60 miles W. S. W. from Cuttack. Lat. 26\u00b0. 18'. N. Long. 85\u00b0. 17'. E. This is a large village and place of considerable trade. The merchants of Berar bring cotton to Cooloo, and return to the interior loaded with salt.\n\nCooloor.\u2014A town belonging to the Nizam, in the province of Bejaia, district of Moodgul. Lat. 16\u00b0. 4'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 2'. E.\n\nCoopang.\u2014A town in the island of Timor, situated on a bay, which forms an excellent harbour for shipping. Lat. 10\u00b0. 10'. S. Long. 124\u00b0. 10'. E. This settlement was formed by the Dutch, so early as the year 1630, and is the only one on the island which they now retain. Their fortified factory is placed close to the sea, and has in the neighbourhood a village inhabited by the natives and Chinese. A trifling commerce was formerly carried on with Batavia, from whence were imported opium, piece goods, and coarse cutlery; the returns consisted of slaves, sandal wood, wax, and some gold.\n\nCoorg, (Coduga).\u2014A district among the western Ghats, situated partly in the Mysore, and partly annexed to the British province of Malabar. The Coorga country is considered to extend from the Tambacherry Pass to the south, to the confines of the Bednore country on the north. Periapatam was formerly the capital, but, in later times, the village of Mercara, situated among the mountains, 25 miles south of Poodicherrim, has been the residence of the rajah's family.\n\nThe Coorgas are a division of the Nair caste, and their prince is named the Vir Rajah. For a long period Hyder attempted in vain to subdue them, until a dispute about the succession arose, when he offered his interference; and, by the destruction of one family, and making the other prisoners, he got possession of the country. Tippoo had the young rajah circumcised, and, during his captivity, his country was a continual scene of devastation and bloodshed, occasioned by the discontent and insurrection of his people. In 1785 he escaped from Tippoo, with whom he carried on a desultory warfare; and, in 1791, Lord Cornwallis found his assistance extremely useful. Prior to this, Tippoo built a fortress in the Coorg country, which he named Jafferabad,\nand maintained a strong garrison in it.\n\nThe mountains of the Coorg country contain many elephants and other wild beasts in the forests, in which are also found not only the best sort of sandal and other valuable woods, but also produce many of the best spices. One of the Vir or Coorga Rajahs, before the country was subdued by Hyder, made a ditch and hedge along the whole extent of the eastern boundary of his dominions, a considerable tract beyond it being utterly desolate, and reckoned neutral. This district having enjoyed a long tranquillity is fast recovering its former cultivation, and now exports considerable quantities of rice into the interior of the Mysore Rajah's territories. The River Cauvery has its source in the Coorg country, but attains to no magnitude until it quits the province, which, like other Nair countries, contains no town, or even village, of considerable size or population.\n\nFerishta mentions the Coorg Rajahs as independent princes so early as 1583, and the family possess biographical histories of their rajahs since 1632. (Dirom, F. Buchanan, 2d Register, &c.)\n\nCooserah, (Cusara).\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, district of Bahar, 43 miles S.E. from Patna. Lat. 25\u00b0. 6'. N. Long. 85\u00b0. 47'. E.\n\nCOOCH BAHAR, (Cuch Behar).\u2014A small district in the province of Bengal, situated between the 26th and 27th degrees of north latitude, and now comprehended in the collectorship of Rungpoor. It is bounded on the north by the Bootan hills; on the south by Rungpoor; on the east by Bootan and Rangamatty; and on the west by Rungpoor. The territorial area has been calculated to contain 1302 square miles.\n\nThe southern part of this district, lying along the River Durlah, is a highly improved and fertile country. The betel nut, the semmel, and the banyan tree, are the most conspicuous trees, and of luxuriant growth.\n\nTo the north of the town of Bahar, towards Bootan, the country has a most wretched appearance; and the inhabitants are a miserable puny race. The land is low and marshy, interspersed with thick woods and many mullahs. The whole face of the country in this quarter is dreary and unpleasant, being thinly inhabited, sparingly cultivated, and extremely unhealthy. The vegetation is coarse, and the ground everywhere almost choked with rank grass, reeds, and fern.\n\nThe lower ranks in the northern quarter are so extremely indigent, that some years ago it was their custom to dispose of their children for slaves, without scruple, to any purchaser for a trifling consideration. It was quite common to see a mother dress up her child, with a view to enhance the price, and bring it to market. Although so little is necessary for the subsistence of a peasant, and food compared with other districts is cheap, yet their poverty and wretchedness are extreme.\n\nIn the year 1618 Sultan Mahmood penetrated as far as Kisraje, or Cach'ha Rajah, in the northern parts of Bengal, called Koj\u00e9 by Ferishta and Couche, by the European travellers of the 15th and 16th centuries. Of this region Cooch Bahar formed a part. Abul Fazel described the chief of Cooch as a powerful sovereign, having Camroop and Assam under his subjection, and able to bring into the field 1000 horse and 100,000 foot. According to the testimony of Mahommedan historians, generally, during the reign of the Emperor Acber, about A.D. 1595, Lukhsmin Narain, the Rajah of Cooch Bahar, was the sovereign of a territory bounded on the east by the River Brahmapootra; on the south by Goragot; on the west by Tirhoot; and on the north by the mountains of Tibet and Assam. His army they exaggerated to the number of 100,000 infantry, 4000 cavalry, 700 elephants, and 1000 war boats.\n\n\u2014Notwithstanding this enormous\narmy, he voluntarily became a vassal to the Emperor Acher, which offending his subjects and chief men, they rebelled against him, and compelled him to request assistance from the Mogul governor of Bengal, which was readily granted, as it afforded the Mahomedans an opportunity of exploring this region, with a view to its future subjugation.\n\nIn 1661 this district was conquered by Meer Junla, who, in compliment to his sovereign, changed the name of its capital to Alungeeernagar, which it did not long retain. Mahomedan fanaticism being then in its perfection, he destroyed the Hindu temples, broke in pieces a celebrated image of Narayana (Vishnu), and converted the son of the rajah, who was on bad terms with his father. In every other respect he administered strict justice to his new subjects, and severely punished plunderers and other offenders. Having completed the conquest, and settled the revenues of Cooch Bahar at 10 lacks of rupees annually, he proceeded to attempt the conquest of Assam, where he failed.\n\nAlong with the rest of the Bengal Soubah, this district devolved to the East India Company in 1765; but little notice was taken of it until the year 1772, when the Rajah of Bootan laid claim to it, and meeting with little resistance from the natives, rapidly gained possession of it. This was the first instance of hostility between the two countries; and it had proceeded to the last extremity before the government of Bengal, which had hitherto derived no benefit from the contested territory, was apprized of what had befallen it. The invaders were easily driven back by two battalions of native infantry; and the Rajah of Bootan, alarmed for his own safety, applied to the Teshoo Lama in Tibet, and obtained a peace through his mediation. (Turner, J. Grant, Stewart, Abul Fazel, &c.)\n\nCootra.\u2014A town in the province of Allahabad, situated on the north side of the Betwah River, 64 miles N. by W. from Chatterpoor. Lat. 25\u00b0.45'. N. Long. 79\u00b0.28'. E.\n\nOn the 8th of June, 1807, the pargannahs of Cootra and Puway were granted by the British government to Rajah Bukht Singh, the grandson of Maharaja Jugguth Ray, one of the prior legitimate possessors of the province, as his lawful inheritance, but then usurped by Gopaul Singh. This marauder was expelled by the British, yet continued to infest the Bundelcund district for several years after, causing infinite damage, and displaying considerable address in his expeditions. By his dexterity in evading pursuit, and the vicinity of impervious jungles and fastnesses, he has hitherto escaped capture; but most of his followers, harassed by repeated defeats and emprizes, have abandoned him. Before the cession of this territory, Rajah Bukht Singh had received an allowance of 3000 rupees from the British government, which afterwards ceased. (Treaties, &c.)\n\nCorachie.\u2014A sea-port town in the district of Tatta, province of Sinde, 57 miles from the city of Tatta, and E.by S. from Cape Monze. Lat. 24\u00b0.51'. Long. 67\u00b0.16'. E.\n\nThe Bay of Corachie affords good shelter for shipping, and vessels of three or 400 tons burthen may enter the port from the beginning of September to the end of May. At low water there is not more than one and a half fathoms fine hard sand on the bar; but the tide rises 12 feet. The entrance of the harbour is narrow, and the deepest water about 200 yards from the western point of entrance, on which is a castle, with two or three bad pieces of artillery. On the eastern side of the bay are six rocky isles, near to which the water is shoal.\n\nThe country from Corachie to the coast is very low, and is overflowed by the Indus, when the snows melt, and the rains fall in the remote mountains of the north. There are flat-bottomed boats at Corachie,\nwhich go through one of the branches of the Indus up to Tatta and Hyderabad at all seasons of the year. The passage to Tatta in June is five or six days, and from thence to Hyderabad two or three days. The Indus here begins to swell early in July, and continues to increase until the end of August.\n\nThe fort of Corachie is built of mud, mixed with chopped straw, and is nearly 150 yards square, with two gates, and round towers or bastions full of loop holes. It has no ditch on the outside, but the reverse, the ground being elevated in a regular slope, which might be ascended without the least difficulty. The population of the town is estimated at 8000 souls, the majority of whom are Hindoos, and engaged in commercial concerns. Although this is the only sea-port to the large province of Sinde, so reduced are its revenues, that in the year 1809 they amounted to only 110,000 rupees, a sufficient proof of the decline of its maritime commerce.\n\nThe soil about this place is very sandy, mixed with pebbles, and in many parts is covered with the prickly milk bush. There are a few date trees in the neighbourhood of the town, but the fruit never comes to perfection. The mango and kamar trees are also seen; but not the cocoa nut, which is seldom found beyond the tropics in this part of Asia. The vicinity produces no vegetables, except pumpkins and brinjals of an indifferent quality, which also applies to the mangoes. The other fruits are plaintains, grapes, water and musk melons. Fuel and forage are very scarce, and the water rather brackish. The camels and draught bullocks are of the best description. There is here a great variety and abundance of good fish and poultry; but the sheep, for want of a suitable pasture, are poor and lean. Rain is here very uncertain: in 1809 the natives asserted that none had fallen for three years.\n\nThe exports from Corachie consist chiefly of ghee, hides, shark fins, saltpetre, potash, asafoetida, Tatta cloth, indigo, frankincense, with a few other gums, seeds, and coarse cloths. The articles brought from the interior for exportation are horses, musk, saffron, and alum, from Multan and the countries to the northward; swords and carpets from Candahar and Khorasan.\n\nCorachie being the principal, or rather the only sea-port in the Sinde province, a great proportion of its commodities are exported from hence; but a part, also, particularly horses, from Tatta, by the routes of Luckput, Bunder, and Maudavie, in Cutch. In the fair season these articles are conveyed in dhingies to Bombay, Gujrat, and the Malabar Coast; from whence are imported black pepper and other spices, tin, iron, lead, steel, elephants' teeth, cochineal, quicksilver, sandal and other scented woods. There is also a trade carried on between Muscat and Corachie; but the dread of the Jowasmic pirates has of late completely frightened the natives from trading to the north of the Indus. The articles of export to that quarter formerly were rice, ghee, indigo, frankincense, and coarse cloths; the returns were silk, dates, and other articles from the Persian Gulf. The only class of people, who are supposed to possess any share of wealth at Corachie are the Hindoos, who are entirely engaged in traffic, and have no share in the executive government; but they enjoy the utmost toleration in respect to religion. Near the town is a tank, containing two tame alligators, one of them of an immense size, which are fed and highly venerated by the Hindu devotees, who dwell in a hut on the banks of the tank.\n\nThere is a constant communication kept up between Corachie and Muscat. Messengers sent from hence proceed first to Sonnecany in two days, from thence to Ournara in six days, to Purnie in four days, and to Zudur in three days;\nfrom whence they cross over in a boat to Muscat, which is generally a passage of three days, but never more than five; making in all 20 days. Except for three months in the year a regular communication may be maintained between this town and Bombay by country boats. For a caravan to Tatta by land the time required is three or four days.\n\nIt is generally supposed that the monsoon does not extend beyond the tropics; but this is not the fact, as it prevails at Tatta, which is in latitude 24\u00b0 44\u2032, yet does not at Corachie, which is beyond the limit to the west. Although the winds blow from the S. W. and W. at Corachie, and along the coast of Mekran, in fresh breezes from April until October, it scarcely deserves the appellation of S. W. or W. monsoon, as the winds often veer round to the N. W. and N. and is very seldom attended with squalls or rain; a continued repetition of which forms a distinguishing mark of the monsoon on the coast of Malabar. (Smith, Maxfield, Kinneir, &c.)\n\nCoringa, (Caranga).\u2014A sea-port in the Northern Circars, district of Rajamundry, situated on the Bay of Bengal. Lat. 16\u00b0 49\u2032 N. Long. 82\u00b0 29\u2032 E.\n\nA wet dock has been formed here capable of taking in a frigate, and is the only construction of the kind on the continent between Calcutta and Bombay. A bar of mud lies across the entrance, through which ships must be forced. A considerable number of country vessels of small burthen are annually built at this port.\n\nThe register of imports at this place exhibit a trade with Calcutta and a few places to the eastward in rice, cummin seed, paper, and copper from the former; and small supplies of pepper and timber from the latter. The exports from Coringa to Calcutta, and partially to Pegue, consist of piece goods and teak wood to the first, and of piece goods to the last.\n\nThe total value of imports, from the 1st May, 1811, to the 30th April, 1812, was 170,960 Arcot rupees, of which 62,864 rupees was from places beyond the territories of the Madras government, viz.\n\n| Place          | Value |\n|----------------|-------|\n| Balasore       | 8,084 |\n| Calcutta       | 23,328|\n| Choodamany     | 1,423 |\n| Eastward       | 3,115 |\n| Pegue          | 3,930 |\n| Penang         | 3,005 |\n| Various places | 19,981|\n\nTotal Arcot rupees 62,864\n\nThe total value of exports, from the 1st May, 1811, to the 30th April, 1812, was 822,348 Arcot rupees, of which 98,550 was to places beyond the territories of the Madras government, viz.\n\n| Place          | Value |\n|----------------|-------|\n| Calcutta       | 59,184|\n| Pegue          | 29,013|\n| Various places | 10,353|\n\nTotal Arcot rupees 98,550\n\nIn the course of the above period 131 vessels and craft, measuring 12,876 tons, arrived; and 235 ditto, measuring 26,714 tons, departed.\n\nCoringa Bay is the only smooth water on the Coromandel Coast in the S. W. monsoon; Point Godavry projecting out to the southward, and breaking the long swell. A remarkable inundation took place here about 30 years ago, which destroyed a great number of the inhabitants and much property. Coringa, as an establishment, originally belonged to the French, who always selected good situations for their settlements, which cannot be said of the English. (Parliamentary Reports, Johnson, &c.)\n\nCorinjah, (Caranja).\u2014A town belonging to the Nagpoor Rajah, in the province of Berar, 48 miles W. by N. from Nagpoor. Lat. 21\u00b0 13\u2032 N. Long. 79\u00b0 2\u2032 E.\n\nCoromandel, (Cholamandala).\u2014This coast extends along the east side of the Bay of Bengal, from Point Calymere to the mouths of the Krishna River. The name is pro-\nperly, Chola Mandala. In Sanskrit the primitive meaning of the latter word is orbit or circle, and thence a region or tract of country; and, probably, it received its name from the Chola dynasty, the ancient sovereigns of Tanjore. In the records of Madras, until 1779, it is written Choramandel. Among the Malays the coast of Malabar is known by the name of Tanna Keeling, or Kalinga, which appellation, however, properly belongs to the northern Circars and Cuttack.\n\nWhen the northerly wind or monsoon prevails on the coast of Coromandel, and in the Bay of Bengal, the southerly wind reigns on the coast of Malabar; and when the northerly wind blows on the latter, the southerly winds prevail on the former coast. The northerly winds are expected on the coast of Coromandel and in the Bay of Bengal, about the middle of October. The periodical change, which is followed by the rainy season, is called the great monsoon. It is frequently accompanied by violent hurricanes, nor is serene weather expected until the middle of December, and sometimes storms happen so late as the 1st of January. The King's and Company's ships are consequently ordered to quit the coast by the 15th October. The southerly wind sets in about the middle of April.\n\nDuring the continuance of the hot winds, the coast of Coromandel is parched up, resembling a barren wilderness, nothing appearing green except the trees. When the rains fall vegetation is restored, the plants revive, and a beautiful verdure is again opened over the country. It is an observation of the natives on the coast of Coromandel, which is confirmed by the experience of many Europeans; that the longer the hot land wind blows, the healthier are the ensuing months; these winds purifying the air.\n\nThe coast of Coromandel is generally an open roadsted without harbours, and there is a considerable difficulty in landing on account of the surf, except at places where proper boats are provided. (Wilks, Crawford, Lind, Kyd, &c.)\n\nCorsele, (Carsi).\u2014A small town in the province of Bejapoor, district of Raybaugh. Lat. 16\u00b0. 40'. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 56'. E. This was formerly a Mahommedan town of some note, but has been so much distressed by the Maharatta Brahmins, that most of that religion have left it. Some, however, still remain, and are subsisted by a revenue arising from charitable lands, granted by the Bejapoor sovereignty during its decline. Near the River Krishna is a burying-ground, where the remains of several Mahommedans of great eminence are buried; and on an island in that river, one mile east of the town, are deposited the ashes of Sheikh Mahommed Serajcud Deen, a celebrated saint of that religion. The River Krishna here runs in an easterly direction, and is about 500 yards from bank to bank. The ford is not a good one, being rocky, and of an irregular depth. This is one of the towns within the Maharatta territory, which enjoys the privilege of killing beef for sale. (Moor, &c.)\n\nCorumbah, (Caramba).\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, district of Chuta Nagpoor, 222 miles W. N. W. from Calcutta. Lat. 23\u00b0. 21'. N. Long. 85\u00b0. 3'. E.\n\nCosah, (Cusi).\u2014This river has its source in the Himalaya Mountains to the north of Nepaul, from whence it pursues a S. S. E. direction; and after a winding course of about 400 miles, joins the Ganges in the Bengal district of Purneah. Formerly this junction took place opposite to Rajemal, but it is now 45 miles higher up. This river is supposed by Major Rennell to be the Cossoanus of Arrian, and is occasionally named the Cossah. It is navigable from Dholat Ghaut to Khoorkunt Ghaut, which is within three days journey of Bejapoor, a town of some note in the country to the east of\nthe Nepaul territories. (Remmel, Kirkpatrick, &c.)\n\nCospoor, (Caspura).\u2014A town in the district of Cachar, a small state tributary to the Birman empire, and adjacent to the district of Silhet in Bengal, which it bounds to the east. Lat. 25\u00b0 N. Long. 93\u00b0 10'. E. In 1763 Mr. Veelst undertook a journey eastward from Bengal, and advanced as far as this place, from whence he returned.\n\nCossimbazar.\u2014A large town in the province of Bengal, situated about a mile south from Moorschedabad, of which capital it may be considered as the port. Lat. 24\u00b0 10'. N. Long. 88\u00b0 15'. E.\n\nThis is one of the largest inland trading towns in Bengal, and in the rainy season has a variety and extent of water carriage, probably not equalled in the world. The Cossimbazar Island is perfectly flat, and one bed of sand. The annual overflow of the river leaves a deposit of mud, which gives richness to this otherwise barren territory. Besides the tiger and the boar, the Island of Cossimbazar abounds with the inferior species of game. The hare, deer, partridges, and quail, with a vast variety of birds, far superior in beauty of plumage to those of Europe, are found along the banks of the Ganges; and the aquatic birds of colder climates are also abundant, such as geese, ducks, snipes, and divers.\n\nCossimbazar has long been famous for its silk manufactures. It is also noted for its stockings, which are all knitted with wires, and esteemed the best in Bengal. The price is from 20 to 35 rupees per score of pairs. The quantity of silk consumed here by the natives annually, in carpets, satins, and other stuffs, is very great; and a large quantity is besides exported to Europe, and to almost every quarter of India.\n\nThe Cossimbazar River is named the Bhagirathi, and is the sacred branch of the Ganges, the others not possessing the same sanctity. In the old Hindoo systems of geography, the west of the Bhagirathi was named the Utter-rari and Daekshin-rari. The east of the same river was named Bhague. (Colebrooke, Lord Valentia, Tennant, &c.)\n\nCossimcott.\u2014A town in the Northern Circars, 20 miles W. S. W. from Vizagapatam. Lat. 83\u00b0 10'. N. Long. 88\u00b0 10'. E.\n\nCote Caungra, (Cata Khankhara).\u2014A strong fortress in the province of Lahore, 122 miles E. N. E. from the city of Lahore. Lat. 32\u00b0 20'. N. Long. 75\u00b0 42'. E. In the neighbourhood of this place was situated the Hindoo temple of Nagur Cote, which was of great celebrity when the Mahomedans first invaded Hindostan, and continued to retain its reputation for sanctity many years afterwards. The Emperor Aebber accomplished the reduction of this fort, after a siege of a whole year, which he commanded in person. He subsequently bestowed it, with a considerable extent of adjacent territory, on an officer who had distinguished himself. (Foster, Remmel, &c.)\n\nCotiotte.\u2014A small district in the Malabar province, containing about 312 square miles. The face of the country resembles the other parts of Malabar, containing low hills separated by narrow valleys, which are fit for the cultivation of rice. Towards the Ghauts, these hills rise to a considerable height; the soil almost everywhere is good, but very little cultivated, owing to the unsettled state in which the country so long continued. Its calamities were in a great measure owing to its forests having encouraged the natives, to make an ill-judged resistance against the British forces.\n\nThe quantity of timber trees procurable in one year, including teak, does not exceed 3 or 400. No metals has been discovered in this district. Wherever the ground is not cultivated, there are stately forests, but the produce of the trees is of\nlittle value. In 1800, the number of houses in Cottewar was estimated at 4087, besides the inhabitants of which, there are in the hills and forests several rude tribes; but the whole number of slaves is only about 100.\n\nThe commerce of this small territory consists in selling the produce of the plantations, and in the purchasing of rice, salt, salt fish, oil, cotton, and cloth. The produce is pepper, sugar cane, cotton, cassia or wild cinnamon, and coffee. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nCottacotta.\u2014A town in the Balaghat ceded territories, 57 miles N. by W. from Cudapah. Lat. 15\u00b0. 16'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 47'. E.\n\nCottapatam.\u2014A town on the sea coast of the Southern Carnatic, 55 miles S. from Tanjore. Lat. 9\u00b0. 58'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 15'. E.\n\nCottee.\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, district of Behar, 90 miles, S. by W. from Patna. Lat. 24\u00b0. 21'. N. Long. 84\u00b0. 40'. E.\n\nCottewar, (Cattivad).\u2014A large district in the centre of the Gujrat Peninsula, of which it is properly the distinctive appellation, and situated principally between the 21st and 23rd degrees of north latitude. Vad, a fence or division in the Gujrattee language, is a very common termination for the names of districts in this part of India; which is frequently changed into war and war by Europeans, as Cattiwar for Cattivad.\n\nThe present inhabitants are named Catties, and are supposed to have long been in possession of the country; although, according to their own traditions, they migrated from the north along the banks of the Indus. They assert their origin to be from Carma, one of the heroes of the Mahabharat; and that they were created for the purpose of stealing cattle. They say they accompanied the Pandoes to Hustinapoor, from whence they were dismissed and assigned a settlement. They were afterwards heard of in Cutch, whence they migrated with their flocks and cattle into the extensive plains of their present country. With these notions of their origin, it is not surprising that many of the tribes openly avow themselves robbers by birth and profession. The first settlement of the Catties was at Thaun, from whence they expelled other predatory tribes, and persevered in their erratic life until the middle of the last century; since when their life has been more settled, being a mixture of the pastoral, agricultural, and predatory, but their inclinations lean most to the last.\n\nAlthough the Catties are so much addicted to robbery, they are considerably removed above the savage state; and in their dress, manners, and food, greatly resemble the Rajputs. They are Hindoos in religion, but the worship of Surya (the sun) prevails more here, than in other parts of India. In general they have retained their ancient manners in great purity, are all horsemen; and except in being more stationary, have in many respects an affinity to the Arabs of the desert. The cloth they sit on while riding serves also for a bed and a tent; and although they never shoe their horses, they perform very long journeys without hurting or laming them. The British government has occasionally procured horses from this portion of Gujrat. The female Catties are noted for being handsome.\n\nThe Arabs have succeeded in establishing an influence throughout the whole of Cottiwar, and in some degree of Cutch. They have for many years been held in high estimation by the natives, as soldiers; and the trade from the Arabian coast, with the Gulf of Cutch, presents an easy mode of conveying them into the country. The constant internal broils of Cattiwar have long afforded great encouragement to all adventurers of a martial disposition. The influence of the Arabs, until lately, has consequently been very great; but, since the British government has interfered in the affairs of Cotti-\nwar, it is to be hoped the internal anarchy will in some degree subside, and preclude the necessity the petty chiefs are under of keeping so many armed retainers.\n\nThe district of Cottiwar contains no towns of magnitude, but many strong holds held by native chiefs, the resort of thieves and robbers. The Guicowar claims a jurisdiction over it, but his requisitions are little attended to, unless when backed by the presence of an army. (M'Murdo, Drummond, Malet, &c.)\n\nCoulan, (Culan).\u2014A town on the sea coast of the province of Travancor, 88 miles N. W. from Cape Comorin. Lat. 8\u00b0. 49'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 40'. E. This is a place of considerable trade; cotton, pepper, ginger, cardamoms, and other articles of merchandize, being deposited in the warehouses here. There is also abundance of excellent fish, tortoises, rice of a good quality, bananas, pine apples, and other fruits and pulse.\n\nIn remote times Coulan was a place of considerable note, and is said to have been built A. D. 825. The Christian, as well as Hindoo natives of this part of Malabar, commence their era at the period of its foundation. Alexius Menezes, the first Archbishop of Goa, opened here his first conference with the Christians of St. Thomas, when he made them renounce the principles of Nestorius, and embrace the doctrines of the Roman Catholic church, to which they continue in part united. The Brahmins possess here a very ancient temple dedicated to Mahadeva, or Siva, and the Catholics have three congregations. Between Coulan and Cape Comorin there are reckoned to be altogether 75 Catholic congregations scattered over the country. (Fra Paolo, &c.)\n\nCourchier.\u2014A town in the Northern Carnatic, district of Ongole, 47 miles N. W. from the town of Ongole. Lat. 15\u00b0. 49'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 37'. E.\n\nCovelong, (Covel, a Temple).\u2014A town on the sea coast of the Carnatic, 25 miles south from Madras. Lat. 12\u00b0. 41'. N. Long. 86\u00b0. 21'. E.\n\nThis fort is called by the natives Sandet-bunder, and was built by Anwarud Deen Khan, within musket shot of the sea, near the ruins of another, belonging to the imperial East India Company of Ostend, whose principal factory was at this place. The French got possession of it, in 1750, by a stratagem. In 1752 it surrendered to Captain Clive, on condition that the commandant should be allowed to carry away his own effects, which turned out to be a great number of junkies, and a quantity of snuff, commodities in which he dealt. After the capture of Chingleput, the fortifications of Covelong were blown up. The sea shore here affords many beautiful shells. (Orme, Fra Paolo, &c.)\n\nCowmul River, (Comala, the Lotus).\u2014A river of Afghanistan, which rises in the hills to the west of Ghizni; and, after a winding course of about 190 miles, joins the Indus.\n\nCowl, or Coel, (Covil).\u2014A town in the province of Agra, 50 miles N. N. E. from Agra. Lat. 27\u00b0. 54'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 37'. E. When Abul Fazel wrote, in 1582, this was the capital of a large district.\n\nCowl Durga, (Covil Durga).\u2014A town and fort in the Rajah of Mysores territories, district of Bednore. Lat. 13\u00b0. 37'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 11'. E.\n\nThe hill on which Cowl Durga stands is not very high; but the walls being lofty, it looks better than most of the hill forts in Karnata, of which the buildings are generally not observable at a distance, being hidden among the immense rocks on which they stand. The Pettah is at some distance, and contains about 200 houses.\n\nThe original name of this town was Bhavani Giri. Tippoo, with the ancient zeal of a Mahommedan, changed the pagan name of almost every town in his dominions, but the new names which he bestowed\non them are sinking fast into oblivion. Near Cowl Durga the country is covered with thick forests. Hodalla, which lies in the neighbourhood, was formerly the residence of a family of polygars, who were hereditary flute players to the sovereigns of Bijanagur. (F. Buchanan, &c. &c.)\n\n**Coyle River, (or Great Buturnee).**\u2014This river has its source in the province of Balhar, district of Chuta Nagpoor, from whence it flows through Gangpoor and Kunjeur; and, after a winding course of above 270 miles, falls into the Bay of Bengal, 10 miles north of Point Palmiras, having previously received the addition of the Bonnee River, about 10 miles from its mouth.\n\n**Crissay.\u2014See Gressec.**\n\n**Croondah.\u2014A town belonging to the Maharattas, in the province of Aurungabad, 103 miles N.

Lat. 10\u00b0. 15'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 5'. E.**\n\nThis town stands about five leagues to the north of Cochin, and formerly belonged to the Dutch; but as they were unable to defend it against Tippoo, they sold it to the Rajah of Travancor, which occasioned the first war with the Mysore Sultan, which began in June, 1790. It was taken from the latter, and dismantled, by M. Lally, Tippoo's general, but the Mysorean troops were driven out in 1791.\n\nThe Jews assert that they possessed Cranangore so early as A.D. 490. In 1505 the Portuguese erected a fortress here, of which the Dutch obtained possession in 1663. The diocese of the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Cranangore, extends from Mount Dilly towards Cochin. Most of the inland churches, formerly belonging to the Nestorian community, are included in it. This see comprehends 89 churches, and is under the domination of Goa. (Fra Paolo; Dow, Bruce, C.

Lat. 14\u00b0. 28'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. E. The name of this town is sometimes written Kirpa, as well as Cudapah. They are both corruptions of the sanscrit word Cripa, which signifies mercy. In the adjacent country large quantities of sugar and jagary are made. Cudapah was for many years the seat of an independent Patan state, which survived the destruction of the Deccany kingdoms.**\n\nTravelling distance from Madras 153, from Seringapatam 220, from Hyderabad 230 miles.\n\n**Cudalore, (Cadalur).\u2014A town on the sea coast of the Carnatic, 102 miles S. S. W. from Madras, and 15 miles S. S. W. from Pondicherry. Lat. 11\u00b0. 44'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 52'. E.**\n\nThe situation of this town is naturally strong, and it would originally have been a more commodious place for the British chief settlement than Madras, it being to windward of Madras and Pondicherry, and in the vicinity of Tanjore.\n\nPrior to 1690 the East India Company had a factory here, which, on account of the increasing trade of Cudalore, was, in 1702, wholly rebuilt and fortified. The town was taken possession of by Col. Coote's army, in 1760, and continued subject to the Nabob of Arcot until the destruction of Col. Braithwaite's detachment by Tippoo, when it was obliged to surrender, by capitula-\ntion, to the combined forces of the French and Hyder, on the 8th April, 1782. The French greatly strengthened the works, and supplied a powerful garrison under the Marquis de Bussy.\n\nIn June, 1783, Cudalore was besieged by the British army commanded by General Stuart; and, on the 7th, the outworks were stormed after a desperate resistance, in which the assailants lost 942 killed and wounded, of whom 500 were Europeans; the greatest loss of this description, particularly of officers, that had yet been sustained in any action in India. On the 25th June, the garrison assaulted the trenches of the besiegers, but were repulsed with the loss of 600 men killed, wounded, and prisoners. In this action two battalions of sepoys fought some of the oldest and best French troops with the bayonet, and foiled them at that favourite European weapon.\n\nTwo days after this sally, the Medea frigate arrived under a flag of truce from Madras at Cudalore, bringing information from Lord Macartney of the conclusion of peace between the two nations. A mutual cessation of hostilities, and restoration of prisoners, in consequence, immediately took place.\n\nThe country in the neighbourhood of Cudalore suffered much during the war of 1780, having been nearly desolated. The inhabitants had either perished, or emigrated, and the villages were mostly in ruins. A happy change has since taken place, and the improvement has been great and rapid. It is now comprehended in the southern division of the Areot collectorship, under the Madras presidency. (Rennel, 5th Report, Bruce, &c.)\n\nCuddren.\u2014A town in the province of Sind, situated on the route from Hyderabad, the capital, to Luckput Bunder, and afterwards to Mandavie in the Gulf of Cutch. Lat. 24\u00b0 26' N.\n\nBetwixt this place and Luckput Bunder is a plain, over which, in the dry season, there is a good road, but swampy during the rains. The country between Meerpoor and this place is but little cultivated, being low marshy ground covered with bushes of the Lye; and the stream of the Goonce is so narrow and shoal, that it is not navigable further south for boats of any description. The town of Cuddren is small, and contains few inhabitants. (Maxfield, &c.)\n\nCudjwa.\u2014A town in the province of Allahabad, district of Korah. Lat. 26\u00b0 5'. N. Long. 80\u00b0 33'.

Lat. 23\u00b0. 6'. N. Long. 88\u00b0. 25'. E.\n\nThe shores here are a bed of mud, and the banks of the river covered with trees and thick jungle. Opposite to the anchorage of the ships, which lie about half a mile from the shore, is a creek, and at a mile from its entrance stands the town of Culpee. The crews of the ships stationed here suffer dreadfully from its extreme unhealthiness, numbers daily falling sacrifices to the pestilential exhalations from the rotten jungle and mud. (Johnson, &c.)\n\nCumly, (Camala).\u2014A fort and town in the district of South Canara, 25 miles S. by E. from Mangalore.\n\nThis place is situated on a high peninsula in a salt water lake, which is separated from the sea by a spit of sand. Two rivers fall into this lake, and contain between them the projection on which Cumly stands.\n\nThe greater part of this coast is occupied by a chain of salt water lakes, but the necks of land interposed render them of little use for an inland navigation. The town contains about 150 houses, the inhabitants of which are chiefly Moplays, Mucuas, Mogayers, and Khankhanies. The interior parts are chiefly inhabited by the Brahmins of Tulava, and the Bunts, or Buntar caste.\n\nAll this southern part of Tulava formerly belonged to the Cumly Rajah, who pretends to be a khetri (military caste) from the north of India. The manners and customs of the family are the same with those of the Rajahs of Malabar. The eldest daughter, in the female line, continues the family. The present rajah resides in the country, but he has neither lands nor authority. The country to the north of the Cumly River formerly belonged to rajahs of the Jain religion, but the last of the Buntar Jain Rajahs was hanged by Tippoo.\n\nThe situation of the fort of Cumly's very fine, and the town has formerly been more considerable. In the rainy season both the rivers and lakes are fresh, and when no boat can venture to sea might afford a supply of fish; this, however, is an article of food which, except by persons of low caste, is seldom used. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nCumoonah.\u2014A zemindar's mud fort in the province of Agra, district of Alyghar. In consequence of the refractory conduct of the zemindar, this place was besieged by a strong British force, and a breach effected on the 19th Nov. 1807: an attempt was then made to storm it, but the assailants were driven back with great slaughter, the loss of men and officers exceeding that sustained in many pitched battles. The impression, however, made on the garrison was such, that they evacuated the place during the night. This description of mud forts, when well defended, generally cause a greater loss to the besiegers than is sustained in the attack of more regular and apparently stronger fortifications.\n\nCundapoor, (Khandapur).\u2014A town in the province of Aurungabad, belonging to the Nizam, 35 miles W.

E.\n\nCurrah, (Khara).\u2014A small district in the province of Allahabad, situated between the 25th and 26th degrees of north latitude, and bounded by the Ganges and Jumna. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows: \"Sircar Currah, containing 12 mahals, measurement 447,556 beegahs. Revenue 22,682,048 dams. Seyurghal 1,498,862 dams. This sircar furnishes 390 infantry, and 9700 cavalry.\"\n\nThe country between the Ganges and the Goonty, from Currah to Benares, on the east side, abounds with sujee muttee, a species of earth impregnated with alkali, from one to three inches thick, which is pared off at the close of the rainy season, and sold to the soap manufacturers at Allahabad and Benares. (Abul Fazel, Williamson, &c.)\n\nCurran.\u2014A town in the province of Allahabad, situated on the S. W. side of the Ganges, 45 miles N. W. from Allahabad. Lat. 25\u00b0. 41'. N. Long. 81\u00b0. 24'. E.\n\nThis place extends a mile along the banks of the Ganges, on the summit of which there is an old fort in ruins. There is also here a new one with a stone gateway, but unfinished. There are many Hindoo temples, in the largest of which is an image of Mahadeva, with a bull looking at him.\n\nThe Emperor Acher removed the residence of the soubahdar from this place to Allahabad, but the decay of Currah is said to have been hastened by the Nabob of Oude, Asophud Dowlah, who demolished many of the buildings to procure stone for his buildings at Lucknow, from which it is distant 93 miles.

Long. 74\u00b0. 48'. E. The inhabitants of this neighbourhood are most Haiga Brahmins, and are a very industrious class of men, who perform all agricultural labours with their own hands. When this part of the country was first ceded to the British, it was much infested by robbers from the Maharatta country, who are now extirpated. When the approach of these robbers was known, the Brahmins, and the other peaceable inhabitants, used to retire from\ntheir houses with their effects, and concealed themselves in the forest even during the rainy season. Pestilence, or beasts of prey, are gentle compared with Hindoo robbers, who, in order to discover concealed property, put to the torture all who fall into their hands. (Cf. Buchanan, &c.)\n\n**Cutch.** *(Ca'ch'a).\u2014A province in the south-western extremity of Hindostan, situated principally between the 23d and 24th degrees of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by a sandy desert and the province of Sindy; to the south by the Gulf of Cutch; to the east it has Gujrat, and to the west Tatta, from which it is separated by the most eastern branch of the Indus. The limits of Cutch to the north are not accurately defined, but it may be estimated at 110 miles in length, by 70 the average breadth. Abul Fazel, in 1582, describes it as follows:\n\n\"To the west of Gujrat is a very large separate territory called Cutch, the length of which is 250 coss, and the breadth 100 coss. The territory of Sindy lies to the west of Cutch. The greatest part of Cutch is composed of woods and uncultivated sands. The horses are fine, and supposed to be of Arabian extraction; and the camels and goats are also remarkably good. The capital city is Tahij, which has two strong forts, Jhareh and Kunkote.\"\n\nThe province of Cutch continues, as described by Abul Fazel, barren and unproductive, the interior remaining almost unknown. It is possessed by various independent chiefs, many of whom boast of their independence, and pretend that since the beginning of the world they have never been conquered; for which, if true, they are indebted to the natural strength and sterility of the country. They also boast that their sway once extended over all Gujrat. On the south coast of the Gulf of Cutch is a district inhabited by a piratical tribe, named Sanganianians, who cruise for merchant ships sometimes as far west as the entrance of the Gulf of Persia. The Hindoo pirates about the Gulf of Cutch are also frequently named Caba.\n\nThe chief town known to Europeans is Boogebooge, which is situated inland; the principal sea ports are Muddi and Mandavic. The principal export is cotton to Bombay, also some ghee and grain; the chief imports are sugar, pepper, raw silk, and piece goods. The cotton produced in this province is considered of an inferior quality. The exports from Cutch to Sinde are cotton, snuff, unwrought iron, produced in Cutch, and the small Arabian aloe.\n\nCutch, like the adjacent countries, is inhabited by a great many predatory tribes, who all claim a Rajpoot origin, although many of them have since adopted the Mahommedan faith. This change of religion is not uncommon in this quarter of India, there being now few tribes of Rajpoots in Cutch that has not partially, and, in some cases, universally adopted the Mahommedan religion. Such are the Sodas, Jadows, Muckwanas, Purmars, Myras, and many others.\n\nThere is a Vurrum Sunker tribe, settled in Cutch, and also in various parts of Gujrat and the Decean, whose modern occupations consist chiefly in selling milk and day labouring. Although of so low a caste, they were the Janooce, or distinguishing string of the higher tribes of Hindoos, and pretend to be descended from the khetri, or military class. The province, generally, is but little cultivated, and very thinly populated.\n\nFutteh Mahommed, the present Zemmadar of Cutch, is of Baloochee extraction, and has endeavoured to secure the friendships of the Ameers of Sinde to support his usurped authority. In this he is countenanced by the latter, who demand the town and district of Luckput Bunder as the price of their favour. (Rennel, Maxfield, Drummond, Wilford, MSS. &c.)\nCUTTACK.\n\nCutch Gundava.\u2014A district in the province of Balloochistan, situated at the bottom of the mountains lying S. E. of Kelat, and is about 150 miles in length, by 40 or 50 in breadth. The soil is rich, black, and loamy; and every species of grain is cultivated, as also cotton, indigo, madder, &c. It rains in June, July, and August, and also a little in the spring months. The simoom, or pestilential wind, blows here during the summer months, and is very destructive, even to the natives. Great quantities of grain are exported from Cutch Gundava to the sea ports of Corachie and Sonneauy, from whence it is shipped to Muscat, the coast of Mekran, &c. To the northward of this district lies Anund Dijil. The climate is good, and the soil excellent, producing a large revenue to the Khan of Kelat. (Kinnier, &c.)\n\nCutch, Gulf of, (Cach'ha, a low Maritime Country).\u2014An arm of the sea on the west coast of India, which bounds the Gujrat Peninsula on the west, and has the province of Cutch on the north. A considerable trade is carried from this gulf to Bombay, principally in cotton; but the inhabitants of the coast have been, from time immemorial, so addicted to piracy, that an unarmed vessel is not to be trusted within the reach of their cruisers. It has consequently been but little frequented by Europeans, and remains but imperfectly explored. The upper part is described by the natives as full of shoals and rocks.\n\nCutchwara, (Cach'chwara):\u2014A district in the province of Malwah, situated about the 25th degree of north latitude, and mostly in the occupation of, or tributary to the Malwah Maharattas. It is intersected by the Gillysinde River. The chief towns are Dewagur and Sooncl.\n\nCutchubarry, (Cachabati).\u2014A town in the Bootan country, situated to the north of Rangamatty in Bengal. Lat. 26\u00b0. 42'. N. Long. 90\u00b0. 9'. E.\n\nCuttack, (Catac).\u2014A large district in the province of Orissa, situated principally between the 20th and 22d degrees of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by Midnapoor and Mohurbunge; on the south by the Circars; on the east it has the Bay of Bengal; and on the west different small states in the interior of Orissa. In length it may be estimated at 150 miles, by 60 the average breadth.\n\nThe country between Gaintee and Bamori is the finest part of Orissa, and is inhabited by a great many weavers, who manufacture muslins in pieces, chiefly for turbans. Between Alter and Anrungabad there are some fine and productive vallies. From Arickpoor to Cuttaek the land is arable, but interspersed with bushes, and not thoroughly cultivated. The Mahanuddy River, in passing through this country, often changes its name from the vicinity of different towns and villages. There is very little gold and silver circulation in this province, the rents being chiefly paid in cowries.\n\nThe tract of country between the Byturnee Nullah, and the Ganjam River, extending about 15 miles on each side of the temple of Juggernauth, to the north and south, is the holy land of Juggernauth. The inhabitants of this portion of territory are exempt from the taxes, which the Hindoos pay for access to the town and temple, except during the Ruth and Dole Jatrries, when they are liable to a small tax. They found their claim for exception on some sacred texts and immemorial usage.\n\nThis country is tolerably well watered, having, besides the Mahanuddy and Bonnee rivers, and their branches, many small streams. It has, however, so recently escaped from the iron government of the Maharattas, that a great extent of land still remains in a state of nature. The chief towns are Cuttack, Juggernauth, Buddruck, and now Balasore, recently attached to it.\n\nThis province was ceded by the\nMaharatta Rajah of Nagpoor to the British in 1803, during the administration of the Marquis Wellesley, on which event it was subdivided into two districts, viz. the northern, named Balasore; and the southern, named Juggernaut. Compared with other districts, of which the population is known, we may estimate the inhabitants of Cuttack at about 1,200,000, almost wholly professing the Brahminical Hindoo doctrines, the Mahomedans not having obtained proper possession of this region until the middle of the 18th century. (Parliamentary Reports, 1st and 2nd Registers, Leckie, C. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nCuttack.\u2014A town in the district of Cuttack, province of Orissa. Lat. 20\u00b0. 31'. N. Long. 86\u00b0. 10'. E.\n\nThis town is built on a neck of land washed by the Mahanuddy and Gunjoory Rivers, and is a place of consequence, as it lies in the only road between Bengal and the Northern Circars. Near Cuttack the Mahanuddy is about two miles from bank to bank in the rains, but in the dry season it is fordable at less than three feet of water. The country around the town is so low, that in the rainy season it is under water for a circuit of 10 miles, and the station is, on the whole, reckoned unhealthy. The fort is named Barabutee, and stands about a mile N. W. from Cuttack.\n\nTravelling distance from Calentta 251 miles; from Nagpoor 482; from Hyderabad 651; from Madras 779; and from Delhi, 902 miles. (Rennel, Upton, 1st Register, &c.)\n\nCutterall.\u2014A town in the province of Delhi, district of Bareily, 40 miles S. E. from the town of Bareily. Lat. 28\u00b0. 3'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 37'. E.\n\nThis place has now the appearance of a large and ruinous village, very thinly inhabited in proportion to its size. Here was fought a decisive battle in 1774, in which Sujah nd Dowlah, with the assistance of the British forces, defeated the Rohillahs, and afterwards subdued Rohilcund as far north as the Loddong Pass. Hafez Rehmut, the principal Rohillah chief, was slain in this action, and the Rohillahs annihilated as an independent state. (Tennant, &c.)\n\nCuttub Minar.\u2014A remarkable pillar situated nine miles south, and 16 degrees west from Delhi. Its base is a polygon of 27 sides, and rises in a circular form. The exterior part is fluted into 27 semi-circular and angular divisions. There are four balconies in the height of the building. The first is at 90 feet, the second at 140, the third at 180, and the fourth at 263 feet. An irregular spiral staircase leads from the bottom to the summit of the Minar, which is crowned with a majestic cupola of red granite. The entire height of the pillar is 242 feet.\n\nThis monument appears to have been intended for a minaret to a stupendous mosque, which never was completed. The tomb of Cuttub Shah, at whose expense the Minar is reported to have been erected, stands a few hundred yards to the westward. Cuttub Shah ascended the Delhi throne A. D. 1205, and died in 1210, after a reign of only five years, and on his decease a stop was probably put to the building. We have reason, therefore, to believe, that this pillar has stood above 600 years. (Blunt, &c.)\n\nCurwa.\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Burdwan, 75 miles N. N. W. from Calcutta. Lat. 23\u00b0. 37'. N. Long. 88\u00b0. 10'. E.\n\nD.\n\nDabul, (Davalaya, the Temple).\u2014A town belonging to the Maharatta Peshwa, in the province of Bejaapoor, district of Concan, 80 miles south from Bombay. Lat. 17\u00b0. 45'. N. Long. 72\u00b0. 55'. E.\n\nDACCA JELALPOOR, (Dhaca Jalal-\nDACCA JELALPOOR.\n\n\u2014A district in the eastern quarter of the province of Bengal, situated principally between the 23rd and 24th degrees of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by Mymensingh; on the south by the district of Backergunge; on the east it has Tipperah; and on the west Rangeshy and Jessore.\n\nPrior to the new arrangement this district was the largest and one of the most valuable in Bengal. It then comprised 15,397 British square miles, subdivided into a number of small zamindaries, and was reckoned the granary of rice for Bengal\u2014a distinction it still retains. Its other productions are betel nut and a species of cotton called banga, necessary, though not of a very superior quality, to form the stripes of the finest muslins; for which the city of Dacca has long been celebrated. Before the separation of some of its districts, this division of Bengal stretched as far south as the sea, at the mouths of the Ganges and Brahmapootra, and extended northerly to the Garow Mountains.\n\nThe Dacca district being intersected by two of the largest rivers in the world and their branches, is subject annually to considerable changes in the boundaries of estates, large portions from the impetuosity of the torrents being transferred from one side of the river to the other, occasioning infinite trouble to the revenue officers, and loss to the government. These annual inundations, however, have a beneficial effect in fertilizing the land in the vicinity; notwithstanding which circumstance, there is no district in Bengal has more jungle and waste land; the whole of which is claimed as the property of individuals, who, though they receive no profit from it, and are too indolent themselves to make it productive of any, will not suffer others to bring it into a state of cultivation without some recompense being paid to them.\n\nPlain muslins, distinguished by various names according to the fineness and closeness of the texture, as well as flowered, striped, or chequered muslins, are fabricated chiefly in this district. The northern parts of Benares furnish both plain and flowered muslins, which are not ill adapted for common uses, though incapable of sustaining any competition with the beautiful and inimitable fabrics of Dacca. Dimities, of various kinds and patterns, and cloths resembling diaper and damask linen, are also made in this district. The export, however, of the above staple articles has of late years much decreased; and the art of manufacturing some of the very finest species of muslins is in danger of being lost, the orders for them being so few, that many of the families who possess, by hereditary instruction, the method of fabricating them, have desisted, on account of the difficulty they afterwards experience in disposing of them.\n\nThe rivers and branches of rivers in this district are beyond number; and, during the height of the rainy season, it is nearly wholly submerged, exhibiting the appearance of an inland sea, interspersed with trees and villages. The principal towns are Dacca, Narraingunge, Sunergong, and Rajanagur.\n\nDuring the Mahomedan government the Dacca province was ruled by a foujdar, the last of whom, prior to our acquisition, was Shahamut Jung Nowazish Mahommed Khan, a nephew and son-in-law of Aliverdi Khan. He was at once dewan of the whole soubah of Bengal, and Nawab Nazim of Dacca, with all the provinces to the eastward. It was in search of the treasures amassed by his deputy, Raj Bullub, and supposed to have been concealed by his son, Krishna Das, when he took refuge in Calcutta, that Seraj ud Dowlah commenced the war, which for him ended so fatally. During the two years soubahdarry of the Nabob Jafler Khan, after the expulsion of Cossim Ali Khan, Mahommed Reza Khan acted as naib at Dacca.\nIn 1801, by the directions of the Marquis Wellesley, then governor-general, the board of revenue in Bengal circulated various queries to the collectors of the different districts on statistical subjects. The result of their replies tended to prove that the Dacca Jelalpoor district, in its existing dimensions, contained 938,712 inhabitants, in the proportion of 14\u00bd Mahommadians to 13 Hindoos, an unusual excess. (J. Grant, Colebrooke, &c.)\n\nDacca, (Dhaca).\u2014A large city in Bengal, the capital of the eastern division of that province. Lat. 23\u00b0. 42'. N. Long. 90\u00b0. 17'. E.\n\nThis place is situated beyond the principal stream of the Ganges, but a very large branch of that river runs past it. Few situations are better calculated for inland commerce than Dacca, as its river communicates with all the inland navigations by a direct course. It lies about 100 miles above the mouth of the Ganges, and 180 by road from Calcutta; but the journey by water, on account of the circuitous route and twistings of the rivers, occupies from one to two weeks, and the space gone over probably exceeds 400 miles.\n\nDacca succeeded to Sunergong as the provincial capital of the eastern quarter of Bengal, and is the third city of the province in point of extent and population. The country around it lying low, and being always covered with verdure during the dry months, it is not subject to such violent heats as Benares, Patna, and other places in Bahar. The unhealthy season is from the 20th of August to the 10th of October; during which period the rivers are subsiding, and the inundation draining off the land. On the whole, however, it is one of the healthiest and most pleasant stations in Bengal. It manufactures and exports great quantities of the finest muslins, in the delicacy and beauty of which fabric it surpasses the whole world. A considerable proportion of the cotton is produced in the district, but a great deal is also received from Patna.\n\nThat Dacca is a city comparatively modern is proved by its not being mentioned by Abul Fazel, at least under that name in the Ayeen Acberry. In A.D. 1608 the seat of government was removed from Rajemal to the city of Dacca by the then governor-general of Bengal, Islam Khan, who, in compliment to the reigning emperor, changed its name to Jehangire Nuggur. Here he built a palace and brick fort, some remains of which are still to be found. The transfer of the seat of government was probably occasioned by the ravages then perpetrating in the south-eastern quarter by the Mughs of Aracan, and the Portuguese pirates under Sebastian Gonzales. In 1657 Meer Junla, the great general of Aurengzebe, pursued the unfortunate Sultan Shujah to this place, and again constituted it the metropolis, the seat of government having been for some years previous transferred to Rajemal.\n\nIt is related that, during the second government of the Viceroy Shaista Khan, rice was so cheap at Dacca, that 640 pounds might be had in the market for one rupee. To commemorate this event, as he was leaving Dacca in 1689, he ordered the western gate to be built up, and an inscription placed thereon, forbidding any future governor to open it until he had reduced the price to as cheap a rate. In consequence of this injunction it remained shut until the government of Serfraz Khan in 1739.\n\nDuring the Mogul government the naval establishment at Dacca consisted of 768 armed cruisers, stationed principally in this district to guard the southern coast from the ravages of the Aracaners, and occasionally to add splendour to religious and other ceremonies. In this quarter of Bengal the veneration of the Hindoos for the tutelary deities of their rivers and waters is extreme, and their ceremonies in honour of\nthem exhibit a degree of cheerfulness and animation unknown elsewhere. The delight they seem to receive from their aquatic rituals has influenced the Mahommedans, in many respects, to imitate them; the latter assigning the superintendence of the floods to Khunjeh Khizzer, supposed to be the prophet Elias.\n\nFor the support of the fleet the land revenue of several districts was assigned, amounting to about 30,000 rupees per month, being the expense of the boats and their crews, of whom nearly 1000 were country-born Portuguese. Towards the end of the 17th century this city was the residence of Azim Ushaan, Aurungzebe's grandson, who commenced and nearly finished a magnificent and extensive palace, now in ruins.\n\nPrior to 1790 Dacca possessed one of these enormous and useless guns, not uncommon in the Deccan and south of India. It was made of hammered iron, being an immense tube of 14 bars, with rings driven over them, and beaten down to a smooth surface, so that its appearance was very good, although its proportions were faulty. From its size this gun must have weighed 64,814 pounds, or about the weight of 11 32-pounders. The weight of an iron shot for the gun must have exceeded 400 pounds; but the experiment of discharging it was probably never tried.\n\nThe present town of Dacca stands on a great deal of ground, and, including the suburbs, extends six miles along the banks of the river; but its breadth is not in proportion. Like other native towns, it is a mixture of brick and thatch houses, with very narrow and crooked streets. The latter description of houses being of very combustible materials are generally burned once, and sometimes twice, per annum; and are viewed, while burning, by their owners with an apathy truly Asiatic. Into large earthen pots, sunk in the floor, they throw the few valuables they possess; and mats, thatch, and bamboos being plenty, the expenditure of a few rupees replaces their edifice in all its original splendour. These fires generally originate with the owners of the house-building materials; and when a fleet of boats, loaded with them, arrives, a conflagration may be expected to ensure a ready sale. The city still continues very populous, although it suffered considerably, apparently remote as it is, by the French revolution, its beautiful fabrics having been in great request at the old French court. The number of inhabitants may be estimated to exceed 150,000, of whom more than one-half are of the Mahommedan persuasion.\n\nDacca is the head-quarters of the court of circuit for the eastern division of Bengal, which comprehends the following districts, viz. 1. Mymunsingh; 2. Silhet; 3. Tipperah; 4. Chittagong; 5. Backergunge; 6. Dacca Jelalpoor; and 7. The city of Dacca.\n\nTravelling distance from Delhi 1107 miles. (Rennel, Stewart, J. Grant, 5th Report, &c.)\n\nDalnow.\u2014A town in the province of Onde, situated on the N. E. side of the Ganges, 47 miles from Lucknow. Lat. 26\u00b0. 3'. N. Long. 81\u00b0. 3'. E. On the banks of the river here are several handsome pagodas and ghants, and also a fort of some extent. This was the birthplace of Rajah Tickait Roy, and ornamented by him.\n\nDalapiri.\u2014One of the small Philippine Islands, about 30 miles in circumference, lying due north from the large island of Luzon, or Lucania. Lat. 19\u00b0. 15'. N. Long. 121\u00b0. 20'. E.\n\nDamaran.\u2014An island about 45 miles in circumference, two leagues distant from the Island of Palawan. Lat. 10\u00b0. 5'. N. Long. 119\u00b0. 50'.

E.\n\nThe Portuguese reduced this place so early as 1531, and it still remains\nin their possession. It makes a conspicuous figure from the sea, the houses and churches being in general white; but the commerce is now much reduced. Ship-building, to a considerable extent, is carried on here, the teak forests being at no great distance. In 1800 a ship, coppered and equipped for sea in the European style, cost about 14l. sterling per ton. The Windham, of 840 tons, was launched here in 1808. The harbour is very commodious for vessels of a small size, there being nearly 17 feet water over the bar. (Cox, Elmore, Malet, Bruce, &c.)\n\nDampier's Straits.\u2014These straits separate the Wageeoo Isles from the Island of Battauta, and have from 12 to 40 fathoms water through the passage.\n\nDamsong.\u2014A town in Northern Hindostan, in the province of Boootan, situated on the east side of the Teesta, or Yo Sanpoo River.

N. Long. 77\u00b0. 40\u2032. E. At this place there is a large mud fort; and in the vicinity are two fine canals, that water much rice land, in a good state of cultivation. The principal article cultivated is tobacco, and a crop of grain is also procured afterwards from the same ground. This place was taken from Tippoo by the southern army in June, 1783, but restored to Tippoo at the peace of 1784. (F. Buchanan, Fullarton, &c.)\n\nDarapooram, (Dharmapuram, the City of Justice).\u2014A town in the province of Barramahal, 103 E. by S. from Seringapatam. Lat. 12\u00b0. 11\u2032. N.

E.\n\nDarwar, (Dharvar).\u2014A district in the Nizam's dominions, in the province of Aurungabad, situated between the 18th and 19th degrees of north latitude. The chief towns are Darwar (named also Futticabad) and Renapoor.\n\nDarwar, (or Futticabad).\u2014A town in the province of Aurungabad, 85 miles south from the city of Aurungabad, the capital of the above district. Lat. 18\u00b0. 40\u2032. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 35\u2032. E.\n\nDarwar.\u2014A fortified town, belonging to the Poonah Maharattas, in the province of Bejaipoor, named by the Mahommendans Nasserabad. Lat. 15\u00b0. 36\u2032. N. Long. 75\u00b0. E.\n\nIn 1784 Tippoo compelled the Maharattas to cede Darwar to him, with other forts and districts, he agreeing to pay tribute for them. In 1790 it surrendered to the Maharatta army, under Purseram Bhow, assisted by three battalions of Bombay sepoys, who bore the whole brunt of the siege, which lasted 29 weeks. It is a very strong place, though not a regular fortification; the ditches are particularly good. The town is\nto the southward of the fort extending eastward, and inclosed by a weak wall and ditch. It was almost destroyed during the siege, and the surrounding country totally devastated by the Maharattas, prior to which it was rich and well cultivated. (Moor, &c.)\n\nDAULI RIVER.\u2014A river in Northern Hindostan, in the province of Serinagur, which, after a short course, joins the Alacananda at Vishnuprayaga, one of the Hindoo holy junctions. It is also named the Sati.\n\nDavanagiri.\u2014A town in the Mysore province, district of Chitteldroogh. Lat. 14\u00b0. 24'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 2'. E. This is a place of considerable trade, containing above 500 houses, with a small mud fort in the centre. The staple commodity of the Chitteldroogh district consists of a kind of blanket, called cunnies, which in their fabric greatly resemble English camlets. They are four cubits broad, by 12 long, and form a piece of dress which the natives of Karnata almost universally wear. They are not dyed, but are of the natural colour of the wool, which, in the fine ones, is almost always a good black. The great excellence of these blankets is their power of turning rain.\n\nThe chief trade of Davanagiri is with Wallajahpetta, near Arcot. The goods carried from hence are betel nut and pepper, and the returns are articles from Madras, imported from Europe, China, Bengal, and the Eastern Islands; together with salt, and a few of the manufactures of the Coromandel Coast. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nDavis Isle.\u2014A small island, one of the Philippines, about 40 miles in circumference, situated about the 124th degree of east longitude, close to the Island of Bool.\n\nDeargoun.\u2014A district in the province of Assam, famous for a temple of Sadasin (Sedasiva). This is an elevated country, on the banks of one of the principal branches of the Brahmapootra. (Wade, &c.)\n\nDebalpoor, (Devalayapura).\u2014A small district in the province of Mooltan, situated about the 31st degree of north latitude. It is intersected by the Beyah and Sutlej Rivers, being partly in the Doabeh Barry, and partly in the Doabeh Jallinder. The chief town is Debalpoor. In 1582 Abul Fazel describes this district as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Debalpoor, containing 29 mahals; measurement, 1,443,767 beegahs; revenue, 129,334,153 dams. Seyurghal, 2,079,170 dams. This sircar furnishes 5210 cavalry, and 53,300 infantry.\"\n\nDebalpoor.\u2014A town in the province of Mooltan, 80 miles S. by W. from Lahore, the capital of a small district of the same name. Lat. 30\u00b0. 43'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 41'. E.\n\nDeb Rawell.\u2014A small town in the province of Mooltan, 120 miles S. by E. from the city of Mooltan. Lat. 28\u00b0. 56'. N. Long. 71\u00b0. 46'. E.\n\nDeccan, (Dakshina).\u2014This term means the South, and was formerly applied, by Hindoo geographers, to the whole of those countries which are situated to the south of the River Nerbudah; but the fixed possessions of the Mahomedans having, for many centuries after their invasion of the Deccan, extended no further south than the River Krishna, the name of Deccan came to signify, in Hindostan, the countries situated between those two rivers only; and such is the popular acceptation of its southern limit at the present day. The countries to the south of the Krishna may be described under the appellation of the South of India; for though along with the Deccan, it has been improperly termed a peninsula, an equal-sided triangle much more resembles their figure.\n\nWhen Amrengzebe had completed the conquest of the Deccan, in 1690, it was subdivided into six soubalis or viceroyalties; viz.\n\n1. Khandesh, (capital) Boorhanpoor.\n2. Aurungabad, or Ahmednug-\ngur, lately the capital of the Nizam Shahee dynasty.\n\n3. Beder, or Kalbergah, the ancient capital of the Bhamence sultans.\n\n4. Hyderabad, including Nandere, the seat of the late Golcondah or Kootubshahee dynasty.\n\n5. Bejapoor, the capital of the Adil Shahy dynasty.\n\n6. The province of Berar.\n\nIn these extensive regions the chief part of the population is Hindoo, especially of those provinces which are under the Maharatta government. There is a considerable Mahommedan population under the dominion of the Nizam, but those who are cultivators have nearly adopted all the manners and customs of the Hindoos. Not only the principal towns and cities, but many of the larger description of villages, are as abundantly supplied with European manufactures of every sort as the natives require. They are provided by a race of men who purchase these commodities at Bombay, and retail them all over the Deccan. They consist generally of woollens, English chintzes, knives, scissors, razors, spectacles, looking glasses, small prints, and different sorts of hardware. But the great mass of the population have not the means, even if they had the wish, of purchasing any considerable proportion of European goods. Any surplus that remains, after the supply of their immediate necessities, is always expended in their festivals, marriages, and religious ceremonies.\n\nThe Deecan is mentioned, by the author of the Circumnavigation of the Erythrean Sea, as one of the divisions of the Indian Continent. His words are, \"From Barygaza (supposed to be Broach, or Brigngosha) the continent stretches to the south; hence that district is called Dachinabades, for, in the language of the country, the south is called Dachanos.\"\n\nThe first independent sovereign of the Deccan was Sultan Alla ad Deen Houssun Kangoh Bhamenee, A.D. 1437, whose capital was Kalbergah. He died A.D. 1357, and was succeeded by\n\nMahommed Shah Bhamenee, who died A.D. 1374. This was the first Mahommedan prince on record who employed a train of artillery in the Deccany wars, worked by Turks and Europeans.\n\nMujahid Shah Bhamenee, assassinated in 1377. This monarch penetrated to Ramisseram, in the Straits of Ceylon, but did not retain permanent possession of the country he had overrun.\n\nDaoud Shah Bhamenee, assassinated in 1378.\n\nMahmood Bhamenee died in 1396.\n\nGheas ud Deen Bhamenee dethroned and blinded in 1396.\n\nShums ud Deen Bhamenee dethroned and blinded in 1396.\n\nFeroze Roze Afzoon Bhamenee dethroned by his brother, who succeeded him in 1422.\n\nAhmed Shah Wallee Bhamenee died 1434.\n\nAllah ud Deen the Second died 1457.\n\nHumayoon Shah Bhamenee died in 1460.\n\nNizam Shah Bhamenee died in 1462.\n\nMahommed Shah Bhamenee died in 1482.\n\nMahmood Shah Bhamenee died in 1518, in confinement, and with him terminated the Bhamenee dynasty, although several other pageant monarchs of that family were placed on the throne. On the dissolution of this empire, the Deccan was subdivided into the following kingdoms, which will be found described under their respective heads; viz.\n\nThe Bejapoor, or Adil Shahee.\n\nThe Golcondah, or Kootub Shahee.\n\nThe Berar, or Ummaud Shahee.\n\nThe Ahmednuggur, or Nizam Shahee.\n\nThe Beeder, or Bereed Shahee.\n\nAurengzebe, while viceroy of the Deccan under his father, Shah Je-\nhan, greatly entailed the territories of the remaining Patan princes of the Deccan, and after he ascended the throne, he subdued the whole; when his wars with the Maharattas, then springing into notice, commenced, and gave him full occupation for the rest of his life. His perseverance was so great, that towards the conclusion of his reign, having taken most of the Maharatta fortresses, they were left without any resource but plunder, but their numbers continued to increase. Many of the powerful and disaffected zeemindars joined them, so that their predatory forces were estimated at 100,000 horse. At the same time, in spite of Aurengzebe's vigilance and habits of business, the Mogul army began to fall off, both in spirit and discipline. The imperial nobility, deprived of the revenue of their jaghires by the Maharatta devastations, had recourse to false musters, and did not keep up half their complement of men and horses. Owing to this, detachments could not be dispersed in pursuit of the marauders; and the grand army, being constantly employed in sieges, left the Maharattas at liberty to plunder without molestation. By their incessant activity they stopped every communication of supply to the imperial camp, where numbers perished by famine; they even offered up mock prayers for the long life of Aurengzebe, whose mode of making war so highly favoured their depredations. In addition to this, the imperial troops were tired out with a constant campaign of above 20 years, and grew disgusted and remiss in their duty. Such was the state of the Deccany provinces towards the conclusion of the long and able reign of Aurengzebe; and from it the difficulties of his successors may be anticipated. It is asserted by Mahomedan authors, that Zulficar Khan, one of Aurengzebe's best generals, during six months, had 19 actions with the Maharattas, and pursued them, from place to place, above 6000 miles, in marches and countermarches. In the year 1717 Nizam ul Muluck obtained possession of what remained of the Mogul conquests in the Deccan, which, from that period, virtually ceased to form part of the empire.

E.\n\nIn 1760 this place was possessed and strongly fortified by Sooraj Mull, the Rajah of the Jauts; but, in 1776, it was taken from that tribe by Nujuff Khan, after a siege of 12 months. It again became subject to the Jaut Rajah of Bhurtpoor. In 1805 Lord Lake attacked Holkar's army, which was encamped under the walls of Deeg, and defeated it with great slaughter. This battle proved fatal to Holkar's regular infantry and artillery; and the action at Puttyghur broke the spirit of his cavalry. Deeg was subsequently surrendered to the British arms, after a short and vigorous siege; and at the peace, which was afterwards concluded with the Bhurtpoor Rajah, he agreed to cede this fortress to the British, who subsequently restored it to him.

This island is subordinate to the district of Jaffnapatam, and affords good pasturage for breeding horses.\n\n---\n\nDELHI, (Dilly).\n\nA large province in Hindostan, situated principally between the 28th and 31st degrees of north latitude. It is bounded on the north by Lahore, and several districts in Northern Hindostan, such as Besseer, Dewarcoate, and Serinagur; to the south by Agra and Ajmeer; to the east it has Oude, and various ridges of high hills, which separate it from Northern Hindostan; and to the west Ajmeer and Lahore. In length it may be estimated at 240 miles, by 180 the average breadth. In 1582 Abul Fazel describes it as follows:\n\n\"The Soobah of Delhi is in the third climate. The length, from Pulwul to Ludehaunch, on the banks of the Satuleje, is 165 coss; and the breadth, from Sircar Rewary to the mountains of Kemanun, is 140 coss; and again, from Hissar to Khyzirabad it is 130 coss broad. On the east lies Agra; on the north-east quarter is Khyrabad, in the province of Oude; to the north are mountains; on the south, the boundaries are Agra and Ajmeer, and Ludehaunch confines it on the west. The principal rivers are the Ganges and the Jumna, both of which have their sources in this Soobah, and there are also many lesser streams. The climate is very temperate. Most of the lands are inundated during the periodical rains, and some places produce three harvests in the year. The rhinoceros is frequently hunted in Sircar Sembhel.\n\nThis Soobah contains eight sircars, viz. 1. Delhi; 2. Budayoon; 3. Kemanun; 4. Sembhel; 5. Scharrumpoor; 6. Rewary; 7. Hissar Ferrozeh; 8. Sirhind. These sircars are subdivided into 232 pergunnahs; the measured lands are 28,546,816 beegahs. The amount of the revenue 601,615,555 dams, out of which 33,075,739 are seyurgahal.\n\nIn the above description are more inaccuracies than in most others by Abul Fazel, which is remarkable, considering the central situation of the Delhi province, and that it contained the capital of the empire.\n\nThe western quarter of this province, especially the country named the Hurrianah, suffers greatly for want of water in the hot season; when it can only be procured from wells, which the inhabitants are obliged to dig from 120 to 150 feet deep. During the rainy season, the Cauggar River overflows part of the Hurrianch; after which the pasture is excellent, and the country tolerably healthy, until the desert to the westward becomes heated. In the latitude of Anopsher between the Jumna and Ganges, this province displays a naked sterility, which is seldom interrupted by the intervention of either trees or cultivation; having been for more than a century past plundered and devastated by every victorious faction. In the territory between the Jumna and Satuleje mango trees are numerous, and the soil produces wheat, barley, gram, and other grains; but, on account of the intestine feuds, is but little cultivated. This part of the province is uncommonly dry, and irrigation is necessary to insure a crop; yet wells are only seen near towns and villages. Water is found\nat a depth of from 10 to 15 cubits below the surface. Feroze the 3d in A.D. 1358, made a canal from the Sutuleje to the Jedjer, 100 miles in length; and cut many other canals and water-courses, which have been long choked up and useless.\n\nAt present (1814), this province is partitioned in the following manner:\n\nAll to the east of the Jumna, with a district round the city of Delhi, and a considerable portion of the north-eastern quarter are possessed by the British, and governed by a regular civil establishment.\n\nThe south-west is occupied by the Machery Rajah of Alvar, the Rajah of Bharupur, and other native chiefs, who are in alliance with, or under the influence of the British government.\n\nThe country to the N.W. of the Jumna, and south of the Sutulege is occupied by a number of petty Seik chief, and other native princes, in dependence on the British, who form a barrier to their territories in this quarter; in addition to which there is always a detachment of troops stationed at Ludhuanach on the Sutulege.\n\nThe western frontier has a natural protection from the immense extent of desert and sterile territory, by which it is bounded.\n\nExcept in the country possessed by the Company, the inhabitants still continue to carry on internal warfare; to which they have been so long accustomed, that they are extremely expert in the use of arms, particularly the lance, sabre, and matchlock. The principal towns are Delhi, Sirhind, Saharanpoor, Burley, Anopshehr, Meerat, Hissar, Seerdhana, Patcalah, and Rudayoon. The inhabitants are a handsome robust race of men, and are a mixture of Hindoos, Mahomedans, and Seiks; the latter religion, being very prevalent in the northern districts.\n\nIn point of population, the Delhi province is greatly inferior to the Company's best cultivated territories, such as Bengal, Bihar, or Tanjore, in the southern Carnatic; but, that part of it under the Company's jurisdiction, may be expected rapidly to improve, as it has now enjoyed a tranquillity of nearly 10 years. The present population of the whole province probably does not exceed five millions. (Abul Fazel, Thomas. 11th Register, Tennant, &c.)\n\n---\n\nDELHI.\n\nA city in Hindostan, the capital of the Delhi province, and formerly of the Patan and Mogul empires. Lat. 28\u00b0 43'. N. Long. 77\u00b0 9'. E.\n\nDuring the splendid era of Delhi, according to popular tradition, it covered a space of 20 miles; and the ruins at present occupy nearly as great a space. In the year 1631, the Emperor Shah Jehan founded the city of New Delhi, on the west bank of the Jumna, which he named Shahjehanabad. It is about seven miles in circumference, and is surrounded on three sides by a wall of brick and stone, but without artillery. The city has seven gates, viz. Lahore Gate, Ajmeer Gate, Turko-nan Gate, Delhi Gate, Mohur Gate, Cabul Gate, and Cashmere Gate; all of which are built of free stone. Near the Ajmeer Gate is a madrissa or college of great extent, built by Ghazi ud Deen, the nephew of Nizam ul Muluc; but it is now shut up, and without inhabitants.\n\nWithin the city of Shahjehanabad, or New Delhi, are the remains of many splendid palaces, belonging to the great Omrahs of the empire. Among the largest, are those of Kummer ud Deen Khan, Ali Merdan Khan, Ghazi ud Deen Khan, and Sefdar Jung. There are also the garden of Coodecah Begum, mother to Mahomed Shah; the palace of Saadet Khan, and that of Sultan Darah Shekoh. They are all surrounded with high walls, and take up a considerable space of ground; as they comprehend gardens, baths, stables for all sorts of\nanimals, and music galleries, besides an extensive seraglio.\n\nIn this quarter of Delhi are many very fine mosques still in good repair, the chief of which is the Jama Musjid, or great cathedral; which was begun by Shahjehan, in the fourth year of his reign, and completed in the 10th; the expenditure amounted to 10 lacks of rupees. Not far from the palace is the mosque of Roshnunud Dowlah, where in 1739 Nadir Shah sat, and saw the massacre of the unfortunate inhabitants of Delhi; since which period, this part of the town has been but thinly inhabited. Besides these there are forty other mosques, but of an inferior size.\n\nThe modern city of Delhi contains many good houses, mostly of brick. The streets are in general narrow, with the exception of two; the first leading from the palace to the Delhi Gate, which is broad and spacious, and had formerly an aqueduct along its whole extent; the second, from the palace to the Lahore Gate.\n\nThe bazars of Delhi are but indifferently furnished, and the population of the city miserably reduced since the end of Aurengzebe's reign; when it is said to have contained two millions of inhabitants, an estimate probably much exaggerated. The Chandery Choke is the best furnished bazar, but the commerce is trifling. Cotton cloths and indigo, are still manufactured in the town and neighbourhood. The chief imports are by the northern caravans, which arrive annually, and bring from Cashmere and Cabul shawls, fruit, and horses. Precious stones of a good quality are to be had at Delhi, particularly the large red and black cornelian and pcerozas; beedee hookah bottoms are also manufactured here. The cultivation in the neighbourhood is principally on the banks of the Jumna, where corn, rice, millet, and indigo, are raised.\n\nThe city is partitioned into 36 divisions, each named after a particular nobleman who resides there, or from some local circumstance. The modern Delhi, is principally built on two rocky eminences. The palace was erected by the Emperor Shahjehan. It is situated on the west bank of the Jumna, and is surrounded on three sides by a wall of red stone, the circumference of the whole being about one mile. Adjoining to it is the fortress of Selimgur, now in ruins. The observatory is in the vicinity of Delhi, and was built in the third year of Mahommed Shah, by Rajah Jeysingh, but has since been repeatedly plundered.\n\nThe gardens of Shalimar were made by the Emperor Shahjehan, and are said to have cost one million sterling; but, like his other works, are now in ruins. They appear to have occupied about one mile in circumference, and were surrounded by a high brick wall. The prospect to the southward of Shalimar, as far as the eye can reach, is covered with the remains of extensive gardens, pavilions, mosques, and sepulchres; all desolate, and in ruins.\n\nDuring the reign of Jehangeer, Ali Merdan Khan brought a canal from the Jumna, where that river approaches Carnaul, to Delhi, a distance of more than one hundred miles; which continued in existence until after the period of the Persian and Afghan invasions, but was subsequently wholly choked up. In the suburbs of Mogul Parah this canal extended three miles in length, and had small bridges erected over it, at different places. In 1810 the British government had workmen employed in cleansing and repairing this canal.\n\nRajahs of Delhi or Indraput are mentioned by the Mahommedan historians so early as A.D. 1008, and, in 1011, the city was taken and plundered by Sultan Mahmood of Ghizni, but it was restored to the rajah as a tributary.\n1193, A.D. Cuttab nd Deen, the slave of Mahommed Gauri, took possession of Delhi from the Hindu princes, and commenced the series of Afghan sovereigns, which reigned until the invasion of Baber, the great grandson of Timour. Cuttab nd Deen continued subject to the Gauride sovereigns of North-western India, until the destruction of that dynasty by Gengis Khan.\n\nA.D.\n1210 Taje nd Deen ascended the throne.\n1210 Aram Shah.\n1210 Shums nd Deen Altumsh.\n1235 Feroze Shah.\n1235 Mallekeh Doran, Sultana Reziah.\n1239 Byram Shah.\n1242 Allah ud Deen, Massud Shah.\n1244 Nassir nd Deen.\n1265 Yeaz nd Deen Balin.\n1286 Kaicobad.\n1289 Feroze Shah Khiljee.\n1295 Secunder Sani.\n1316 Shaheb nd Deen Omar.\n1317 Mubaric Shah.\n1321 Tughlik Shah.\n1324 Sultan Mahommed.\n1351 Feroze Shah the Second.\n1289 Abubcere Shah.\n1393 Nassir nd Deen, Mahmood Shah. Timour in 1398 crossed the Indus, and took and pillaged Delhi during the reign of this prince; with whom, in 1413, ended the dynasty of Afghan princes of the tribe of Khiljee.

During this and the preceding reigns Hindostan was divided into separate states; for in the Deccan, Gujrat, Malwah, Jionpoor, and Bengal, there were princes who assumed the style and dignity of kings. The districts also in the immediate vicinity of Delhi were occupied by different chiefs, who scarcely even in appearance acknowledged the supremacy of the Delhi sovereign.\n\n1488 Secunder Ben Lodi.\n1516 Ibrahim Lodi. In 1525 this prince was defeated by Sultan Baber, who the same year took possession of Delhi, and founded the Mogul dynasty.\n1525 Sultan Baber.\n1530 Humayoon.\n1556 Jellalud Deen Mahommed Acber. This prince was born at Amerkote in 1542, proclaimed emperor in 1556, and died at Agra in 1605. He was the greatest of all the Mogul or Pattan sovereigns. His Vizier, Abul Fazel, was murdered by some banditti, in the 47th year of his age.\n1605 Jehangeer.\n1628 Shah Jehan.\n1658 Aurengzebe died the 21st February, 1707.\nShah Allum the First, his eldest son, died by poison in 1712.\nJehaundar Shah dethroned and killed in 1712.\nFerokhsere assassinated in 1719.\nRusbeh ul Dirjant, a child, died in 1719, reigned four months.\nRusbeh nd Dowlah, a child, died in 1720, reigned three months.\nMahommed Shah died in 1747.\nIn 1735 the Maharattas had made such progress that they burned the suburbs of Delhi. Nadir Shah entered Delhi on the 9th March, 1739, and on the 14th April began his retreat, having collected immense plunder.\nMahommed Shah was succeeded by Ahmed Shah, who, in 1753, was deposed and blinded.\nAhumgeer the Second was assassinated in 1756, in which year Ahmed Shah Abdelli first entered Delhi.\nShah Jehaun dethroned 1760.\nShah Allum the Second, 1761. He left the protection of the British at Allahabad, and entered Delhi in 1771. In 1788 he was blinded with a dagger by Gholam Kaudir, the Rohillah, who tortured, starved to death, and massacred, many of the royal family. A few months afterwards he was put to death with tortures by Madhajee Sindia. This city continued subject to the Sindia family from about 1770 until 1803, when General Lake, having defeated the army of Dowlet Row Sindia on the 11th Sept., within six miles of Delhi, entered it next day. From this period the city of Delhi has, in reality, been subject to the British government, although nominally, with a tract of country round it, under the authority of the Mogul.\n\nShah Allum, the blind Emperor of Delhi, departed this life in Dec. 1806, after a long and disastrous reign of 44 years. His son Acber was, on the same day, placed on the throne. The tranquillity which prevailed in the city on his accession was unexampled at the commencement of any prior reign, which had been invariably marked with tumults, commotions, and bloodshed. In 1807 he signified to the British government his wish to nominate his third son, Wulli Ahud, as his successor, which met with a decided refusal; and the resident at his court was instructed to explain to his majesty the impolicy of appointing any other of his sons to the exclusion of the eldest, Abul Suffer.\n\nSince the above period the tranquillity of this great and ancient city has suffered no interruption. The native chiefs, for whom a liberal allowance has been made by government, appear to be sensible of its strong claims on their gratitude, and the community at large to perceive the advantages of security of person and property, and the impartial administration of justice which they now enjoy, contrasted with the anarchy and constant scenes of bloodshed which marked the rapacious dominion of the Maharattas. Cultivation is daily on the increase, breaches of the peace seldom occur, and murder is hardly ever committed. Within the city the value of property of every description, but more especially of houses and lands, has more than doubled, when compared with its worth during former governments.\n\nTravelling distance from Calcutta by Birbloom 976 miles.

E. This fortress, which commands the principal pass into Bootan, was taken by storm, in 1773, by a detachment under the command of Captain John Jones. The fame of this exploit greatly alarmed the Thibetians. It was afterwards restored to the Rooteas.\n\nDenalcott.\u2014A town in the province of Coimbetoor, 72 miles S. by E. from Seringapatam. Lat. 11\u00b0 28'. N. Long. 77\u00b0 11'. E.\n\nDeodhur.\u2014A town in the province of Gujrat, near the western boundary, and on the road from Therab to Theraud.\n\nThis place contains about 1000 houses, the greatest part of which are inhabited by Rajpoots and Cooles. There are few koonbees, or cultivators, so that the land lies waste, and the inhabitants subsist mostly by plundering their miserable neighbours. There is here a small ghurree, or fort, about 150 yards square; and the whole town is surrounded by a ditch 15 feet deep, but passable in many places. The jungle comes close up to the town, and there is a great deficiency of water.\n\nDeodhur is the property of a Wagilla Rajpoot, who resides in it. His family formerly possessed the adjacent country, at which period the capital was Bheelree, 16 miles from this place, and still said to exhibit magnificent ruins. Bheelree had 250 villages subject to it; but, at present,\nthere are only eight subordinate to Deodhur. The present rajah is named Poonjajee, and is a notorious marauder and robber. (M'Murdo, &c.)\n\nDeoghir, or Deoghur.\u2014See Dowletabad.\n\nDeogur, (Devaghar, the Fort of the Gods.)\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, 105 miles W. N. W. from Moorshedabad. Lat. 24\u00b0 36'. N. Long. 86\u00b0 40'. E.\n\nAt this place multitudes of pilgrims are seen carrying the water of the Ganges to the western side of India. It is transported in large flasks, or bottles, of nearly five quarts each, suspended at the end of a bamboo which rests on their shoulders. A considerable trade in this article is carried on, notwithstanding the distance. (Hodges, &c.)\n\nDeonella, or Deomully.\u2014A town in the Rajah of Mysore's territories, 23 miles N. by E. from Bangaloor. Lat. 13\u00b0 15'. N. Long. 77\u00b0 54'. E.\n\nNear to this town is a sect, a subdivision of the Murresoo Wocul caste, every woman of which, previous to piercing the ears of her eldest daughter, preparatory to her being betrothed in marriage, must undergo the amputation of the first joints of the third and fourth fingers of their right hand. The amputation is performed by the blacksmith of the village, who, having placed the finger on a block, with a chisel performs the operation.\n\nIf the girl to be betrothed be motherless, and the mother of the boy have not before been subjected to the amputation, it is incumbent on her to suffer the operation. In three districts this caste occupy above 2600 houses, and for the original cause of this strange ceremony they relate a long legendary tale. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nDeopoor, (Devapura).\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, district of Monghir, 40 miles W. by S. from Moorshedabad. Lat. 24\u00b0 4'. N. Long. 86\u00b0 33'.

It is tributary to the Goorkhali Rajah of Nepaul.\n\nDeucar.\u2014A town in Northern Hindostan, the capital of a small district of the same name, and tributary to Nepaul. Lat. 28\u00b0 9'. N. Long. 82\u00b0 10'. E.\n\nDevaprayaga, (the Union of the Gods).\u2014A town in Northern Hindostan, in the province of Serinagur, situated at the confluence of the Bhagirathi and Alacananda Rivers. Lat. 30\u00b0 9'. N. Long. 78\u00b0 31'. E.\n\nThe Alacananda, before its junction, is, in width and depth, the most considerable stream, being 142 feet in breadth; and, in the rainy season, it rises 46 or 47 feet above the low water level. The breadth of the Bhagirathi is 112 feet, and it is said to rise 40 feet during the rains. The union of these streams forms the Ganges, the breadth of which is 80 yards immediately below the junction.\n\nThis is one of the five principal prayags (holy points where two rivers meet) mentioned in the Shastras,\nand is considered by all the Hindoos as a place peculiarly sacred. The town stands at the confluence of the rivers, and is built on the scarp of a mountain about 100 feet above the water. The mountain rises eight or 900 feet above the town. The houses are, in general, two stories high, built of large stones, with a coarse limestone cement, and covered with a sloping roof of shingles. In the upper part of the town stands a temple sacred to Raghunath, or Ramachandra, constructed of large pieces of cut stone, piled up without mortar, in height about 60 feet. The presiding deity is an image about six feet high, cut in black stone, the lower part of which is painted red.\n\nThe town contains 200 or 250 houses, and is inhabited by Brahmins of different sects, but principally those from Poohah and the Deccan. Twenty-five villages were conferred in Jaghire by the Rajah of Serinagar, and since continued by the Goorkhali government of Nepaul, for the support of this establishment; but the annual produce not exceeding 1000, or 1200 rupees, is very insufficient for the maintenance of the numerous officiating priests.\n\nThe town and temple suffered much by an earthquake in 1803, the latter was repaired at the expense of Dowlet Row Sindia. The resident Brahmins can give no information when, or by whom the edifice was constructed; the only point they are quite sure of is, that it has been in existence 10,000 years. (Webb, &c.)\n\nDevicotta, (Devicata, the Fort of the Goddess).\u2014A town in the province of Tanjore, situated at the mouth of the Coleroon River, 127 miles S. by W. from Madras, and 42 miles south from Pondicherry. Lat. 11\u00b0. 20'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 55'. E. This place was taken from the Rajah of Tanjore by Major Lawrence in 1749, on which occasion Lieutenant Clive particularly distinguished himself. It was afterwards taken by M. Lally, in June, 1758.

E.\n\nDewarcundah, (Devakhanda).\u2014A large district in the province of Hyderabad, extending along the south side of the Godavary, and situated principally between the 18th and 19th degrees of north latitude. The country, on the northern frontier of this division, along the banks of the Godavary, is very desolate, and contains the ruins of several forts and towns which once existed. The chief towns are Balcumudah and Jacall. Dewarcundah is in the Telungana country, and the Telung, or Andray, is the spoken language. (Blunt, &c.)\n\nDewarcote, (Diwarcota).\u2014A district in Northern Hindostan, in the province of Serinagar, situated about the 31st degree of north latitude, between the Jumna and Ganges. With the rest of the province it is tributary to the Goorkhali government of Nepaul.\n\nDewarcote.\u2014A town in the province of Serinagar, the capital of a district of the same name. Lat. 30\u00b0. 59'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 2'. E.\n\nDewelmurry, (Devalayamari).\u2014A Gaond village in the province of Gundwana, 65 miles S. W. from Bustar. Lat. 19\u00b0. 14'. N. Long. 81\u00b0. 48'. E.\n\nThis is one of the most considerable Gaond hamlets in the country, and has an extensive spot of ground cleared round it. It is situated on the east bank of the Baumgunga\nRiver, which is here a considerable stream, being augmented by the junction of the Wurda and Wainy Gunga Rivers, about six miles to the N. W. of this place. (Blunt, &c.)\n\nDEYRAH.\u2014A town in Northern Hindostan, in the province of Serinagur. Lat. 30\u00b0. 19'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 45'. E. This small town is populous and well built, and is the capital of the lower division of Serinagur, which includes a space of level country lying between a chain of scattered hills, on the south of the great range of northern mountains. It formerly paid tribute to the Seiks, but latterly to the Goorkhali government of Nepaul. (Foster, &c.)\n\nDHELL.\u2014A Portuguese settlement on the north coast of the Island of Timor. Lat. 8\u00b0. 35'. S. Long. 125\u00b0. 30'. E. This town is inhabited by natives, Chinese and Portuguese, who carry on a traffic with Macoa, and the neighbouring isles.\n\nDHENJEE.\u2014A town belonging to Dwaraca, and situated at the extremity of the Gujrat Peninsula. This place is held by a relation of the Manick of Dwaraca's, and is so difficult of access, owing to a jungle almost impenetrable, and rough, rocky, uneven ground, that the Manick of Dhenjee has nearly withdrawn from his allegiance. Being situated inland, this place possesses no piratical vessels, but it furnishes men to the sea ports, and receives a proportion of the pirated goods. A treaty was concluded by Colonel Walker, on the 20th Dec. 1807, with the Dhenjee Chief, Wagha Manick, by the conditions of which he agreed to relinquish the profession of piracy, to assist vessels in distress, and to abstain from plundering them. (M'Murdo, Treaties, &c.)\n\nDHOOLOPOOR,(Dholapar).\u2014A town in the province of Agra. 42 miles S.S.W. from the city of Agra. Lat. 26\u00b0. 43'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 55'. E.\n\nThis place stands about a mile from the River Chumbul, on the banks of which is a fort of the same name with the town. The river in February is here about three-fourths of a mile across, and must be forded at Kyteree, four miles higher up, as it is deep at the fort. Dhoolpoor is a town of considerable size, and the hilly country begins in its vicinity, approaching from the north. (Hunter, &c.)\n\nDHROLE.\u2014A large and populous walled town in the Gujrat Peninsula, situated near the Gulf of Cutch. The environs of this place are covered with gardens, and the town completely concealed by trees, with a clear stream of excellent water running under it. It belongs to the Byand of Jam. This place had formerly 140 villages subject to it, but Jam of Noanuggur has possessed himself of the greater part. (M'Murdo, &c.)\n\nDHYRSA.\u2014A small village in the Gujrat Peninsula, situated near the Rnn, in the district of Moorvee. At this place are many funeral monuments, one of which is in commemoration of a mother, who voluntarily burned herself on the funeral pile of her son\u2014these immolations not being restricted to the death of the husband. The River Phoolyer, with a small clear stream, and high rugged banks, runs past this village. (M'Murdo, &c.)\n\nDHORE.\u2014A town in Northern Hindostan, in the country of the 24 Rajahs, and tributary to the Nepaul government. Lat. 28\u00b0. 39'. N. Long. 83\u00b0. 45'. E.\n\nDIAMOND HARBOUR.\u2014A harbour in the River Hooghly, in the province of Bengal, about 34 miles below Calcutta in a straight line, but much more by the windings of the river. This place is singularly unhealthy, especially in the months of July, August, and September, at and after the periodical rains. This is probably owing to the proximity of the anchorage to the low swampy shores, where a number of rivulets open into the stream of the Hooghly, and bring down a quantity of putrid vegetable and animal substances,\nthat emit the most offensive vapours. At Diamond Harbour the Company's ships usually unload their outward, and receive the greater part of their homeward bound cargoes, from whence they proceed to Sagor Roads, where the remainder is taken in. There are mooring chains laid down here, and on shore the Company have warehouses for ships' stores, rigging, &c., and at an adjacent village provisions and refreshments are purchased.\n\nDiamond Island.\u2014A small island on the east side of the Bay of Bengal, about 12 miles south from Cape Negras. Lat. 15\u00b0. 51'. N. Long. 94\u00b0. 12'. E. This island abounds with excellent turtle of the largest size, from 40 to 50 of which may be turned in one night. The shore being studded with sharp rocks, except in one or two places, considerable caution is required in landing from boats. (Johnson, &c.)\n\nDiamper, (Udyamapura).\u2014A town in the province of Cochin, 17 miles E. by S. from the town of Cochin. Lat. 9\u00b0. 55'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 37'. E. Here a celebrated synod was held to convert the Nestorian Christians to the Roman church.\n\nDidwana.\u2014A town in the province of Ajmeer, 50 miles north from the town of Ajmeer. Lat. 27\u00b0. 20'. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 53'. E.\n\nDigliggy Neur.\u2014A town in the Island of Ceylon, situated 10 or 12 miles to the eastward of Candy, in the direction of Battacolo. The district round this place is still more wild and impenetrable than that which surrounds Candy, on which account it has been selected for a royal residence. At one period, when the king was driven out of Candy, and his capital burned, he found here a retreat to which no European army has been able to penetrate. There are a few villages scattered among the surrounding hills, and in those places where the woods leave a clear space the soil produces rice. (Percival, &c.)\n\nDinagepoor, (Dinajpoor).\u2014A district in the province of Bengal, situated principally between the 25th and 26th degrees of north latitude. On the north it is bounded by Rungpoor and Purneal; on the south by Ranjeshy; on the east by Rungpoor and Mymensing, and on the west by Purneal and Rajemal. This district was formerly named Circear Pinjerah, and, according to Major Rennef's measurement in 1784, contained 3519 square miles. During the Mogul government, Dinagepoor, along with Edrappoor, constituted the territorial jurisdiction of Aurun-gabad, and was originally a frontier towards the independent Rajaship of Cooch Bahar, on which account it was but little known, and lightly assessed.\n\nThe soil of this district is considerably diversified, and the face of the country of a waving appearance, being divided into small valleys, each two or three miles broad. These valleys are watered by small rivers, which, in the rainy season, swell into large lakes, 50 or 60 miles in length, and two or three in breadth, overflowing all the low lands, which are dry in the cold season. These valleys, at the distance of 50 or 60 miles from the Ganges, are scarcely higher than the surface of its waters; when, therefore, the river is swollen by periodical rains, the waters of the valleys are not only prevented from running off, but are so much increased as to be navigable for vessels of considerable burden.\n\nThe soil of the elevated portions of land is, in general, a stiff clay, in some places black and porous, in others white and tenacious. The soil of some of the valleys resembles that of the elevated parts, and that of the others is rich and loamy, with a substratum of the same kind of clay which forms the higher grounds. These low lands are, for the most part, covered with long grass of different sorts, and afford pasture to a great many buffaloes, and large herds of other cattle. The northern parts of the district are more level than\nthe southern ones, have a loamy soil, and are well cultivated.\n\nThe higher lands, in the south of the district, are inhabited by Mahomedans, and the lower by Hindoos. On the higher clay lands very little besides rice is produced, and except in very small spots which are well manured, only one crop in the year. The loamy valleys, which do not lie so low as to endanger the inundation of the crop, produce not only rice, but also a good crop of mustard, or pulse, in the cold season. The land which produces two crops is let for a rupee and a half per beeegal (one-third of an acre); that which produces one crop three-fourths of a rupee per beeegal.\n\nThe inhabitants of the Dinagepoor district are, in general, extremely poor; and their farming utensils are therefore proportionally simple and wretched. Only one person attends a plough, holding the handle in one hand, and occasionally pulling the tails of the oxen with the other. A pair of oxen may be purchased for six or eight rupees, a plough for five-sixths, and a yoke for one-fourth of a rupee. In the dry season it is often necessary to water the fields, which is done with a sort of trough 12 or 16 feet long. Rice is the staple commodity of the country, of which four kinds, including several varieties, are principally cultivated.\n\nThe next article is indigo, for which many parts of this district are improper, as it will not grow in the white clay lands, is sparingly produced on the black or red clays; and as most of the soft and loamy parts lie so low, as to be subject to sudden inundations, which would destroy the crop.\n\nMany sorts of fibrous plants for cordage and sackcloth are sown in April, May, and June; the phacelia, mungo, and mustard seed, are also raised. Flax, though abundantly cultivated in the central parts of Bengal, for its use in making oil, is but little cultivated in this division. The natives know nothing of its use to make thread.\n\nThe kind of wheat found in this quarter is bad, and the flour produced therefrom is of a very dark colour, consequently is not saleable among Europeans. Several sorts of pulse are sown at the commencement of the cold season, such as kesari, (lathyrus sativa), the mashuri, (cynum lens), and the boot (cicer arietinum). Tobacco is cultivated to a considerable extent in low and loamy lands; and on moderately high spots, where the soil is good, the sugar-cane is planted in February and March.\n\nAt present the poverty, prejudices, and ignorance of the natives strongly operate against improvements in agriculture. Could an adequate remedy be found for these evils, many other things might be cultivated to great advantage. Hemp would flourish in many spots. Cotton, which is scarcely cultivated, might be raised to a great extent, if proper methods were taken to introduce the best kinds; and the culture of wheat and barley might occupy many acres, which now lie in a waste state.\n\nSeveral sorts of timber might be planted all over the district, and indeed all over Bengal. The sisoo, the Andaman red wood, the jack tree, the teak, the mahogany, the satin wood, the chuckrassy, the toon, and the sirisha, should be principally chosen. The sago tree would grow in all the higher parts; and the date tree, planted close, would greatly improve many spots now wholly unproductive.\n\nIn the Dinagepoor district several obstacles present themselves to the farmer. Large flocks of wild buffaloes and hogs infest the fields; and inundations, occasioned by the overflowing of the rivers, frequently destroy the crops. In the present state of society the introduction of dairies, the fencing and manuring of land, the use of wheel carriages, and improvements of a similar kind, are scarcely practicable.\nIn 1801, by the directions of the Marquis Wellesley, then governor-general, the board of revenue in Bengal circulated various queries on statistical subjects to the collectors of the different districts. The result of their replies tended to establish the fact, that the Dinagepoor district contained 600,000 inhabitants, in the proportion of one Mahommedan to four Hindoos; and that the zemindar's profit exceeded 10 per cent. annually.\n\nRamnauth, one of the Vaisya caste, from Upper Hindostan, is the earliest known ancestors of the present rajah's family, and held the zemindary about 1728. (Carey, J. Grant, Colebrooke, &c.)\n\nDinagepoor.\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, the capital of a district of the same name, situated on the east side of the Parnabubah River, 102 miles N.N.E. from Moorshedabad. Lat. 25\u00b0.37'. N. Long. 89\u00b0.40'. E.\n\nDinapoor.\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, district of Bahar, situated on the south bank of the Ganges, two miles west from Patna. Lat. 25\u00b0.38'. N. Long. 85\u00b0.3'. E. Here are very extensive cantonments for a brigade of troops. The officers have more accommodation than in any barracks in England; and the private soldiers of the European regiments are provided with large and well-aired apartments. The native soldiers are quartered in small huts, which to them is no hardship. Beyond Dinapoor is an excellent house in the European style, belonging to Saadet Ali, the present Nabob of Oude, and built by him while residing as a private person under the Company's protection. He was continuing his improvements when he was raised to the throne of Oude, consequently several of the buildings remain unfinished. (Lord Valentia, &c.)\n\nDindigul, (Dandigala).\u2014A district in the south of India, situated between the 10th and 11th degrees of north latitude. To the north it has Coimbetoor and Kistnagerry; to the south Travancor and Madura; on the east it has the Polygar territory and Madura; and on the west Travancor, Cochin, and Malabar. The principal rivers are the Noil and the Amravati; and the chief towns Dindigul, Balny, and Palapetty.\n\nIn the villages of Dindigul the same internal policy is found to prevail as in the other provinces. Certain inhabitants, under particular titles, are in the enjoyment of a portion of land rent free, and are the hereditary occupiers of the remainder. Certain principal officers, the curnum (or register accountant of the revenue affairs of the village), ironsmith, carpenter, barber, washerman, village watchman, potmaker, dancing girls, the distributer of water, &c. &c. are sometimes found in a village, sometimes only a part of them. They have the government produce of a portion of land assigned to them for their livelihood, but no claim to cultivate the land; and, from the occupation in life of many of the incumbents, it may be imagined they seldom have the wish. A portion of the produce is given to them in addition, both from the grain in the ear, and from the heap when threshed.\n\nDindigul was ceded to the Company by Tippoo in 1792; and now, together with Madura, the Manapara Pollams, Ramnad, and Shevagnunga, forms one of the collectorships under the Madras presidency. The Dindigul districts and sequestered pollams have been converted into 40 zemindaries. (Hodson, 5th Report, Hurdis, &c.)\n\nDindigul.\u2014A town in the south of India, the capital of a district of the same name. Lat. 10\u00b0.29'. N. Long. 78\u00b0.5'. E. The fort of Dindigul is situated on a strong rock, in the midst of a plain, or rather valley, which forms its district; bounded to the west by the great range of mountains which separates it from the coast of Malabar; and on the\neast by a lower range which runs between it and the district of Madura.\n\nIt was conquered in 1755 by the Mysore Rajahs, and was taken by the British army in May, 1783; but restored to Tippoo at the peace of 1784. It was finally acquired by the British, along with the district, in 1792.\n\nTravelling distance from Serinagapatam, 198 miles; from Madras, 275 miles. (Wilkes, Rennel, &c.)\n\nDingulwara.\u2014A town possessed by independent chiefs, in the province of Gujrat, 70 miles N. E. from Ahmedabad. Lat. 23\u00b0. 15'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 53'. E.\n\nDinding (Pulo) Isle.\u2014This island and the Pulo Sanbelong (nine islands) lie, at the entrance of the Pera River, in the Straits of Malacca, about latitude 4\u00b0. 15'. N.\n\nDitteah, (Datta).\u2014A town in the province of Bundelcund, 20 miles E. from Narwar. Lat. 25\u00b0. 43'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 32'. E.\n\nThis town is about a mile and a half long, and nearly as much in breadth, populous, and well built; the houses being mostly of stone, covered with tiles. It is surrounded by a stone wall, and furnished with gates. The rajah has a palace without the town, on the south-east side, on an eminence; from whence there is a view of the country as far as Pachoor, Narwar, and Jhausi. Close to this hill is an extensive lake.\n\nThe inhabitants are a robust, handsome race of men; have a great reputation as a warlike people, and make excellent soldiers. In 1790 the surrounding district yielded a revenue of nine or 10 lacks of rupees annually, subject to the payment of a tribute to the Maharattas. During the reign of Amrenzebe, Ditteah was the capital of Dholput Roy, a Bundelkah Rajah of some celebrity.\n\nOn the cession of Bundelcund by the Peshwa to the British, in 1804, Rajah Pareckhyet of Ditteah joined the British standard; and a treaty was arranged with him, by which he was confirmed in the possession of the territory, which, from ancient times, had descended to him by inheritance. In consideration of this favour he agreed to consider the Peshwa and the British as his perpetual allies, and engaged to refer to the latter for adjustment of any disputes that might arise with neighbouring chiefs professing obedience to the British government: reciprocal assistance to be given to each other in quelling any disturbances in the contiguous territories of the allies. (Hunter, Scott, Treaties, &c.)\n\nDiu, (Divipa, the Island).\u2014A small island and harbour at the southern extremity of the Gujrat Peninsula. Lat. 20\u00b0. 43'. N. Long. 71\u00b0. E.\n\nThis small island, about four miles long by one broad, in ancient times, contained a Hindoo temple, dedicated to Somnath, celebrated for its sanctity and riches. A.D. 1025, Sultan Mahmood of Ghizni, having conquered, or rather overrun the province of Gujrat, reached this place; and, having plundered the temple, broke the image in pieces, and dispatched the fragments to Mecca, Medina, Ghizni, and other Mahomedan cities. The wealth acquired here is described as being equal in value to all the booty he had acquired during his prior expeditions.\n\nIn 1515 the Portuguese obtained possession of Diu; and in 1536, by permission of Bahadur Shah, the Sultan of Gujrat strongly fortified it. While the Portuguese power prospered it enjoyed a considerable commerce; but it fell with their decay, and in 1670 was surprised and plundered by the Muscat Arabs, then a considerable maritime power, who obtained great plunder. It has since dwindled away, and is now an insignificant place, with little or no commerce; but it may, at some future period, become again of consequence, on account of its harbour and geographical situation. (Stewart, Bruce, Duncan, &c.)\n\nDoab.\u2014This name should properly include all the territory between the Jumna and Ganges; but the term\nis usually restricted to the southern portion of it, for the most part comprehended in the province of Agra, and, during the Mogul government, subdivided into the districts of Firozabad, Kanoge, Etawah, Korah, Currah, and Allahabad. There are several doabs in Hindostan, the name meaning any tract of country included between two rivers.\n\nThis country is, in general, fertile, and produces rich crops when properly cultivated. Tamarind and large mango trees abound, and give the country the appearance of a forest. The millet raised, although a small-eared grain, furnishes a great quantity of straw, 10 feet long, which is of great use as provender for cattle. Besides millet, sugar-cane and barley are cultivated; and, in the neighbourhood of Kanoge, considerable quantities of tobacco, the only plant introduced by Europeans that is in general request in Hindostan. The soil of the Doab is so much adapted to the produce of indigo, that the plant is there found in a wild state, of superior quality to that produced by cultivation. The cattle, generally, are much inferior in weight and size to those of the more southerly provinces. During the months of April and May, before the commencement of the rains, the atmosphere of the Doab is excessively sultry; and even in the winter season it is the morning only that is cool. A coarse cotton cloth, dyed red with cheap materials, is manufactured about the centre of this province; and also another species, named gezis and gezinas.\n\nDuring the latter part of the Nabob of Oude's government this country was, for some time, under the management of Almass Ali Khan, a eunuch, and was then tolerably well cultivated; but the whole face of the province in the Lower Doabs, and the numerous towns in ruins, proves the miserable government it was usually subjected to. Remains of its former population and fertility are seen everywhere amongst the extensive wastes and jungles which now occupy a large portion of the surface. The tranquillity which it has lately enjoyed, under the British authority, has been so long unknown to the inhabitants, that a rapid improvement may be expected, and indeed is already visible. A considerable part of the military population are Mahomedans, long accustomed to a predatory life; and some time must elapse before they can accommodate their habits to the new situation in which they are placed.\n\nBy the treaty of peace, concluded with Dowlet Row Sindia on the 30th Dec. 1863, he ceded to the British all his forts, territories, and rights in the Doab, between the Ganges and the Jumna, and all territories lying to the north of the Rajahs of Jynagur and Joudpoor, and the Rannah of Gohud. The southern part of the Doab was ceded, during the administration of the Marquis Wellesley, in 1801, by the reigning Nabob of Oude, Saadet Ali. It did not constitute any of the original possessions of his family, having been added, along with Rohilcund, to the Oude dominions by the victories obtained by the British armies. (Tenant, Asiatic Registers, Colebrooke, &c.)\n\nDOABEH BARRY, (Bari, Residence).\u2014A district in the province of Lahore, situated between the Beyah and Ravey rivers, and the 30th and 31st degrees of north latitude. In modern maps this territory is placed in Mooltan; but, according to Abul Fazel's arrangement, in 1582, it belonged to Lahore. He describes it as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Doabeh Barry, containing 52 mahals, measurement 4,580,002 beegahs, revenue 142,820,183 dams, sevurgal 3,923,922 dams.\"\n\nThis country is also named Manjha, and the Seiks who inhabit it are named Manjha Siaghs. It contains the cities of Lahore and Amritseer; and becomes, in consequence, the great centre of the power of the Seik\nnation. Runjeet Singh of Lahore, Futteh Singh of Allawal, and Joodli Singh of Ramgadia, are the principal chiefs of the country, which is described as less fertile towards the mountains than the Doabeh Jallinder; but, as it lies on the same level, it must possess nearly the same climate and soil. (Malcolm, Abul Fazel, &c.)\n\n**Doabeh Jallinder.** (Jalindra).\u2014A large district in the province of Lahore, included between the Sutuleje and Beyah rivers, and for the most part between the 30th and 31st degrees of north latitude. Abul Fazel, in 1582, places it in the Lahore province, and describes it as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Doabeh Beit Jallinder, containing 60 mahals, measurement 3,279,302 beegahs, revenue 124,365,212, seyurghal 2,651,788 dams. This sircar furnishes 4,155 cavalry, and 79,586 infantry.\"\n\nThe Jallinder Doab, which reaches from the mountains to the junction of the Sutuleje and Beyah, is the most fruitful of all the possessions of the Seiks, and is not excelled in climate and vegetation by any province in India. The soil is light, but very productive; and the country, which is open and level, abounds in every kind of grain. The want of water, which is so much felt in other parts of India, is here unknown, as it is found everywhere in abundance, within two or three feet of the surface. The principal towns are Jalindra and Sultanpoor.\n\nThis territory is principally occupied by the Malawa Singh Seiks, who are called the Doabeh Singhs, or Singhs who dwell betwixt two rivers. With these chiefs we are little acquainted. In 1808 Tarah Singh was one of the most considerable; but he and the others have been greatly weakened by their constant internal discord. (Malcolm, Abul Fazel, &c.)\n\n**Doda Bailea.**\u2014A small fortified village in the territories of the Mysore Rajah. Lat. 13\u00b0.30'. N. Long. 77\u00b0.25'. E. The greater part of the country around this place is covered with bushes or coppice wood, although the soil is good, and the country nowhere too steep for cultivation. For 100 years past this place has been subject to the Mysore, although it was separated from the capital by the Mahommedan government of Serai. In the mean time several of the neighbouring hill forts, or droogs, continued subject to their original polygars, who were mostly robbers, until the whole were finally expelled by Tippoo. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\n**Doessail.**\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, district of Chuta Nagpoor, 213 miles W. N. W. from Calcutta. Lat. 23\u00b0.11'. N. Long. 85\u00b0.16'. E.\n\n**Dono.**\u2014A small town, tributary to the Malwah Maharattas, in the province of Agra, 21 miles S. W. from Gualior. Lat.26\u00b0.9'. N. Long. 79\u00b0.50'. E.\n\n**Dolcai.** (Dholeu).\u2014A town and district in the province of Gujrat, ceded to the British government in 1803 by the Guicowar, in part payment of the subsidiary force supplied for his protection. Lat. 22\u00b0.47'. N. Long. 72\u00b0.25'. E.\n\n**Dolian.** (Dolia).\u2014A town possessed by independent chiefs, in the province of Gujrat, 33 miles north east from Cambay. Lat. 25\u00b0.47'. N. Long. 72\u00b0.26'. E.\n\n**Domea.**\u2014A town in the kingdom of Tungquin, situated inland on the principal branch of the Tungquin River. Lat. 20\u00b0.40'. N. Long. 106\u00b0. E. In the 17th century this was a place of considerable trade, and frequented by European vessels, particularly the Dutch.\n\n**Domus.**\u2014A town in the British territories, in the province of Gujrat, situated at the mouth of the Tuptee, 15 miles S.W. from Surat. Lat. 21\u00b0.5'. N. Long. 72\u00b0.53'. E.\n\n**Dondra Head.**\u2014The southernmost extremity of the Island of Ceylon, adjacent to which is the settlement of Matura. Lat. 5\u00b0.50'. N. Long. 80\u00b0.40'. E.\nDOONAH, (Duna).\u2014A town in the province of Gundwana, 30 miles south from the town of Gurrah. Lat. 22\u00b0. 48'. N. Long. 80\u00b0. 3'. E.\n\nDOONDEAKERA, (Dundjacaara).\u2014A town in the Nubob of Oude's territories, 50 miles S. by W. from Lucknow. Lat. 26\u00b0. 12'. N. Long. 80\u00b0. 40'. E.\n\nDOORYGHAUT, (Durighat).\u2014A town in the province of Allahabad, district of Gazypoor, situated on the south side of the Boggrath, 70 miles north east from Benares. Lat. 26\u00b0. 15'. N. Long. 83\u00b0. 31'. E.\n\nDOORYDROOG.\u2014A fortified hill in the Rajah of Mysore's territories, 80 miles N. N. E. from Seringapatam. Lat. 13\u00b0. 27'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 25'. E.\n\nDORY HARBOUR.\u2014A harbour on the northern coast of Papua. Lat. 48\u00b0. S. Long. 134\u00b0. 35'. E. The promontory of Dory, the sea-coast of which extends about 14 leagues, is of a moderate height, the ground every where ascending gradually. The trees are lofty, with little underwood. The neighbouring country abounds with fresh water rivulets, and there is good grass. The climate is temperate, being so near to the high mountains of Arfak, where the clouds settle. At this harbour are neither fowls nor goats; but wild hogs, fish, greens, and fruit, are to be had. The Papuas resident at this harbour are supplied with plantains and calavansa beans by the horasoras of the interior, who receive in return iron and other goods. Wood is plenty here, and the wild nutmeg grows in the vicinity. (Forrest, &c.)\n\nDOUDPOOR, (Daudpoor).\u2014A town in the province of Gundwana, possessed by independent Goard Chiefs, 35 miles S. by E. from Bostar. Lat. 19\u00b0. 36'. N. Long. 85\u00b0. 10'. E.\n\nDOUPARRA.\u2014A town in the South of India, district of Commim, 87 miles N. from Cudapah. Lat. 15\u00b0. 43'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 4'. E.\n\nDOWLETABAD.\u2014A district in the Nizam's dominions, in the province of Aurungabad, situated principally between the 19th and 20th degrees of north latitude, and extending along the north side of the Godavery.\n\nDOWLETABAD, (Deoghir, or Deoghur).\u2014A town and strong fortress in the province of Aurungabad. Lat. 19\u00b0. 52'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 2'. E. This place is deemed by the natives impregnable. It stands on the summit of a mountain, which is surrounded with other inclosures, of which that on the plain contains a large town. The two lower forts are so overtopped by the upper, that they are entirely under its command.\n\nWhen the Mahommedans carried their arms into this part of the Deccan, under Allah ud Deen, about the year 1293, Deoghir, or Tagara, was the residence of a powerful Hindoo Rajah, who was defeated, and his capital taken and plundered of immense riches. In 1306 this fortress and the surrounding district were reduced to permanent subjection by Mallek Naib, the Emperor of Delhi's general. In the early part of the 14th century, the Emperor Mahammed made an attempt to establish the capital of his empire at Deeghir, the name of which he changed to Dowletabad. To effect this he almost ruined Delhi, in order to drive the inhabitants to his new capital, 750 miles distant from their old habitations; he was, however, unable to carry his scheme into effect.\n\nAbout the year 1595 Dowletabad surrendered to Ahmed Nizam Shah, of Ahmednuggur, and on the fall of this dynasty it was taken possession of by Mallek Amber, an Abyssinian slave, who was reckoned the ablest general, politician, and financier of his age. His successors reigned until 1634, when it was taken by the Moguls during the reign of Shah Jehan, and the capital transferred to the neighbouring town of Gurka, or Kerkhi, since named Aurungabad. It is now comprehended in the dominions of the Nizam. (Ferishna, Scott, Orme, Rennel, Wilks, Wilford, &c. &c.)\nDravida, (or Dravira).\u2014This is the ancient name of the country which terminates the south of India. Its northern limits lie between the 12th and 13th degrees of north latitude, and it is bounded on the east by the sea, and on the west by the Eastern Ghats. The name, however, is occasionally extended to all the country occupied by inhabitants who speak the Tamil language, and there is a whole caste of Brahmins designated by the name of Dravida Brahmins.\n\nThe subordinate divisions of Dravida were named from the three rival dynasties of Cholan, Cheran, and Pandian. The first, governing in Tanjore and Comboocoonum, possessed the northern tract; Pandian had Madura and the south; and Cheran united Kangian and Salem to the dominions of the Kerala, on the Malabar Coast. (Wilks, Colebrooke, F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nDubaree, (Dobari, the Two Houses).\u2014A town in the Nizam's dominions, in the province of Aurungabad, 12 miles N. W. from Julna. Lat. 20\u00b0. 4'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 23'. E.\n\nDubroo, (Dhubay).\u2014A town in the province of Gujerat, district of Chunpaneer, 40 miles N. E. from Broach. Lat. 22\u00b0. 4'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 35'. E. There are here the remains of a Hindoo city of great antiquity, which indicate its having been formerly decorated in a very superior style. The fortifications which surround it are nearly three miles in circumference, and the ancient parts that yet remain are constructed in an elegant and costly manner. The situation is extremely low, wet, and marshy. (10th Register, &c.)\n\nDuchenparah, (Dalshinpara, the Southern Portion).\u2014A district in the north-east quarter of the province of Cashmere, situated between the 34th and 35th degrees of north latitude. Abul Fazel, in 1582, says, that the snow on the mountains of this country never decreases, so that from the cold, the narrowness of the roads, and the great height of the mountains, they cannot be passed without extreme difficulty.\n\nDuchenparah.\u2014A town in the province of Cashmere, the capital of a district of the same name, and situated at the foot of a ridge of high mountains which bound Cashmere on the side of Great Tibet. Lat. 34\u00b0. 51'. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 58'. E.\n\nDuckinshahabazpoor.\u2014A large island in the province of Bengal, situated at the junction of the great River Megna with the sea, and originally formed from the sediment deposited by its waters. In length it may be estimated at 30 miles, by 13 the average breadth. It is very low land, and, in spring tides, during the rains, is almost wholly submerged. In the channels between Duckinshahabazpoor and the neighbouring islands, the bore, caused by the sudden influx of the tide, prevails with great violence, and renders the navigation extremely dangerous. Salt of an excellent quality is here manufactured on the Company's account, at an establishment subordinate to the Bulwah and Chittagong agency.\n\nDumoodah River, (Damodara, a name of Vishnu).\u2014This river has its source in the district of Ramgur, province of Bahar. It afterwards flows through the adjoining district of Pachete, and joins the Hooghly a few miles below Fultah. Including the windings, its course may be estimated at 300 miles.\n\nDunda Raooor.\u2014A town in the province of Bejapoor, situated on the sea-coast of the Concan district. Lat. 18\u00b0. 19'. N. Long. 72\u00b0. 55'. E. This place is also named Jizzera Jessore, and belongs to the Sidhee family, formerly the hereditary admirals of the Mogul empire.\n\nDundah.\u2014A large village in the province of Sinde, situated on the south bank of the Goonee River. Lat. 24\u00b0. 58'. N.\n\nThe surrounding country is well cultivated, and the village inhabited by a considerable number of weavers. It stands on the route from Hydera-\nbad to Mandavvee, on the Gulf of Cutch, by the River Goonee, which is here one fathom and a half deep, and about 70 yards broad. About 12 miles to the south-east it contracts to the breadth of 20 yards, with two fathoms depth. (Maxfield, &c.)\n\nDungye.\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, district of Shahabad, 68 miles S. W. from Patna. Lat. 25\u00b0. 14'. N. Long. 84\u00b0. 17'. E.\n\nDunfeewarah, (Dautiraro).\u2014A town belonging to independent chiefs in the province of Gujrat, district of Dandar. Lat. 24\u00b0. 55'. N. Long. 72\u00b0. 45'. E.\n\nDurbungah, (Durbhanga).\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, district of Tirhoot, 55 miles N. N. E. from Patna. Lat. 26\u00b0. 7'. N. Long. 85\u00b0. 54'. E.\n\nDurraim, (Durrajya).\u2014A town belonging to the Maharatts, in the province of Malwah, 25 miles N. W. from Bopal. Lat. 23\u00b0. 28'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 9'. E.\n\nDurrampoor, (Dharmapur).\u2014A town in the province of Aurungabad, 50 miles S. S. E. from Surat. Lat. 20\u00b0. 34'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 29'. E.\n\nDussara.\u2014A town in the province of Gujrat, district of Chalawar, containing 1300 houses, the greater proportion of which are possessed by Kurbatties; the remainder of the population being Coolees, Rajpoots, and other castes, besides a few Banjans.\n\nThis place, with the 12 surrounding villages, is the property of a Mahommedan zemindar entitled Mullick, whose family came originally from Mooltan. The authority is at present possessed by two relations, one of whom resides in the small fort, and the other in the town. One of their ancestors, about A.D. 1269, was put to death by the Rajah of Halwad, for having committed gowhattia (cow-killing), and is now held in great veneration by the adjacent Mahommedan inhabitants as a saint. His tomb is on the banks of a large tank in the neighbourhood of the town.\n\nThe military force of Dussara is composed of 2000 horsemen of the Mullick caste, and 100 infantry, who are kept in active employment, in preventing the depredations of the Jhuts. From Dussara towards Adrianna, the country is tolerably well cultivated, the population consisting chiefly of Coolees, and the inferior castes of Rajpoots. (M'Murdo, &c.)\n\nDuttar, (Dattara).\u2014A small district in the Seik territories, in the province of Lahore, situated between the 31st and 32d degrees of north latitude. The chief towns are Begwarah, Horizpoor, and Malpoorah.\n\nDwaraca, (Dwarica, the Gate).\u2014A town and celebrated temple in the province of Gujrat, situated at the S. W. extremity of the Peninsula. Lat. 22\u00b0. 21'. N. Long. 69\u00b0. 15'. E.\n\nThis place is at present possessed by Mooloo Manick, who is more powerful than any other of the Oacka chieftains. The sacredness of the place attracts a rich and numerous population, and presents a safe asylum from danger. There are 21 villages belonging to Dwaraca, containing 2560 houses, which, at the rate of four persons to each house, would give a population of 10,240 souls subject to it. By an agreement, executed on the 14th or December, 1807, Mooloo Mauick Sunyance, of Dwaraca, engaged with the British government not to permit, instigate, or connive at any act of piracy committed by any person under his authority; and also to abstain from plundering vessels in distress. On their part, the British engaged to afford the temple at Dwaraca every suitable protection and encouragement; a free and open commerce to be permitted to vessels paying the regulated duties.\n\nThe original and most sacred spot in this quarter of India is Dwaraca; but, about 600 years ago, the valued image of their god Runchor (an incarnation of Krishna), by a manoeuvre of the Brahmins, was con-\nveyed to Daceoor, in Gujrat, where it still remains. After much trouble, the Brahmans at Dwaraca substituted another in its stead, which, unfortunately, also took a flight across a narrow arm of the sea, to the Island of Bate, or Shunkodwar, about 130 years ago, and another new one was placed in the temple here.\n\nDwaraca is also designated by the name of the island; and, having been long the residence of Krishna, the favourite Hindoo deity, is a celebrated place of pilgrimage for the sectaries of that religion. In performing this pilgrimage, the following ceremonies take place:\n\nOn the arrival of the pilgrim at Dwaraca he bathes in a sacred stream named the Goomty, from its windings; for permission to do which he pays the Dwaraca chief four and a quarter rupees; but Brahmans pay only three and a half. After this purification a visit is made to the temple, where offerings are presented, according to the circumstances of the devotee, and a certain number of Brahmans are fed.\n\nThe pilgrim next proceeds to Aramra, where he receives the stamp from the hands of a Brahmin, which is made with an iron instrument, on which are engraved the shell, the ring, and the lotos flower, which are the insignia of the gods. This instrument is made hot, and impressed on any part of the body, but generally on the arms; and, by not being over-heated, generally leaves an impression on the spot. It is frequently impressed on young infants; and a pilgrim may receive, not only his own stamp, but also stamps on his body for any absent friend. This stamp costs one and a half rupees.\n\nThe pilgrim next embarks for the Island of Bate, where, on his arrival, he must pay a tax of five rupees to the chief, present liberal offerings to the god, and dress him in rich cloths and ornaments. The Chief of Bate, who is a holy person, receives charge of the present, and retails it again to other pilgrims at a reasonable rate, who present it again to the deity, and it performs a similar revolution. The average number of pilgrims resorting annually to Dwaraca has been estimated to exceed 15,000, and the revenues derived to the temples a lack of rupees.\n\nNotwithstanding this existing place of pilgrimage, the most authentic Hindoo annals assert, that Dwaraca was swallowed up by the sea a few days after the decease of Krishna. This incarnation of Vishnu spent much of his time at Dwaraca, both before and after his expulsion, by Jarasandha from Mathura, on the banks of the Jumna, in the province of Delhi, which would indicate a greater intercourse between these distant places, than could have been expected at so remote a period. The chalk with which the Brahmans mark their foreheads comes from this place, where it is said to have been deposited by Krishna; and from hence, by merchants, is carried all over India. (M. Murdo, &c.)\n\nEASTERN ISLES.\n\nThe Archipelago, comprehended under this title, is included between the 22d degree of north, and the 10th of south latitude, and extends to the 138th degree of east longitude. Under the name of each island respectively a particular description will be found; but the following observations, principally by Dr. Leyden, applying generally to the whole, may be properly inserted under this head, and are too valuable to be omitted.\n\nThe inhabitants of the Eastern Isles, or Indo Chinese nations, at a very early period seem to have embraced the religious system of Buddha, but at what period of time can-\nnot now be discovered: at present it is chiefly confined to the continent. The coasts of the Malayan Peninsula, and of the greater part of the Eastern Isles, are principally occupied by Mahommeddans. The original inhabitants, therefore, being mostly confined to the interior of these islands, are still very imperfectly known to Europeans; so that it is often impossible to determine whether their religious institutions are most connected with the tenets of Brahma or of Buddha. They all, however, appear to have a connexion with the grand features of Hindoo superstition.\n\nThe Indo Chinese nations, with the Singhalese, or inhabitants of Ceylon, uniformly employ the Bali or Pali language in the sacred compositions of the Buddhist sect. This language does not exist as a vernacular tongue; but is the language of religion, learning, and science, and appears to have exerted an influence over the vernacular language of the Indo Chinese nations, similar to that which Sanscrit has exhibited among the popular languages of Hindostan and the Deccan.\n\nThe Malaya language, and the more original languages of the Eastern Isles, seem in their original formation to have been polysyllabic. The Indo Chinese languages may be considered in the following order; viz.\n\n**Polysyllabic Languages.**\n\n1. Malaya.\n2. Jaura.\n3. Bugis (in Celebes).\n4. Bima (Sumbhawa).\n5. Batta (in Sumatra).\n6. Gala or Tagala (Philippines).\n\n**Monosyllabic Languages.**\n\n7. Rukheng (Aracan).\n8. Barma (Ava).\n9. Mon (Pegu).\n10. Phay (Siam).\n11. Khomen (Cambodia).\n12. Law (Loos).\n13. Anam (Tunquin and Cochin China).\n\n**Learned Language.**\n\n14. The Pali.\n\nThe tribes of the Eastern Isles exhibit a variety of singular and interesting appearances; not only in the civil and political, but also in the moral history of man. If some of them appear in a naked and primitive state of barbarism, in others the vestiges of ancient art and science indicate, that they have suffered a relapse from a prior state of civilization. This is particularly obvious among the Malay, Javanese, Batta, and Buggess tribes, among whom the polished style and elevated sentiments of many of their compositions, and their dexterity in some of the arts, especially the compounding and working of metals, form a singular contrast with the neglect of personal morality, and the relaxation of all the bonds of society, while ancient and wise regulations are in a great measure superseded by the most absurd and barbarous usages.\n\nAmong the most barbarous of the Horafora and Papna races, there are some, who, whether male or female, use no species of clothing whatever; and, consequently, exhibit few traces of that modesty, which is supposed to be innate in the human species. The same phenomenon is exhibited among the Biajoos, the families of whom live constantly together on the sea in small boats. Vestiges of cannibalism appear to exist among the greater part of the rude tribes in the Eastern Isles; but the Battas of Sumatra, who are superior to the Malays in the knowledge of arts and letters, have likewise preserved it, as well as the Tabunka tribe in Celebes. Of many of their most absurd and barbarous usages, it is impossible to form at present a just opinion; as we are totally ignorant of the spirit of them, and of the system of religious opi-\nnions, with which they are connected.\n\nThe Malays, Javanese, and all the east insular Mahommedans are Soo-\nnees, the Shias being unknown to them but by report, yet held by\nthem in great abhorrence. (Leyden, Edinburgh Review, &c.)\n\nECALAM.\u2014A town and fortress in\nthe province of Bengal, district of\nDacca Jelalpoor, frequently men-\ntioned in the histories of Bengal,\nbut of which not a vestige now re-\nmains.

The former\nhave an annual allowance of 14\npagodas, and the latter 10 pagodas.\nAs in this part of the country the\nworshippers of Jain are more num-\nerous than those of Siva, the temples\nof the former ought to have the best\nendowments; but, while the native\nofficers of government are mostly\nBrahmins, pretence will never be\nwanting for distressing the Jain\ntemples.\n\nAt this place there is an immense\ncolossal image of one of the gods\nworshipped by the Jain, which\nstands in the open air, and is formed\nof one solid piece of granite. The\nhills about this place are considered\nunproductive, and the country gene-\nrally extremely poor. (F. Buchanan,\n&c.)\n\nELEPHANTA ISLE.\u2014A small island\nbetween Bombay and the main land,\nabout five and a half miles from\nBombay, in an easterly direction.\nLat. 18\u00b0. 57'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. E. It\nis five miles in circumference, and\ncontains about 100 inhabitants, who\ncultivate a little rice, and rear sheep\nand poultry. The island is nearly\ncovered with wood of a luxuriant\ngrowth, and abounds with springs of\nexcellent water; it is nevertheless\nalmost a desert, and is principally\ncelebrated for the remains of Hindoo\nmythological excavations and sculp-\ntures which it contains.\n\nOpposite to the landing place is a\ncolossal stone elephant, cracked and\nmutilated, from which the Portu-\nguese named the island; by the na-\ntives named Gharipoor. The entrance into the cave is 55 feet wide, its height 18 feet, and its length equal to its width. It is supported by massy pillars carved in the rock, and the sides of the cavern are sculptured into compartments, representing the persons of the Hindoo mythology; but the end of the cavern, opposite the entrance, is the most remarkable.\n\nIn the centre is a remarkable Trimurti, or three-formed god. Brahma the creator is in the middle, with Vishnu the preserver on one side, and Siva or Mahadeva, the destroyer, on the other. The latter holds in his hands a cobra capella snake, and on his cap, among other symbols, are a human skull and a young infant. The under lip of all these figures is remarkably thick. The length from the chin to the crown of the head is six feet, and their caps are about three feet more. On each side of the Trimurti is a pilaster, the front of which is filled up by a figure 14 feet high, leaning on a dwarf, but both much defaced.\n\nTo the right is a large compartment hollowed a little, and carved with a great variety of figures; the largest of which is 16 feet high, representing the double figure of Siva and Parvati, named Viraj, half male and half female. On the right of the Viraj is Brahma, four-jaiced, sitting on a lotos; and on the left is Vishnu, sitting on the shoulders of his eagle Garuda. Near Brahma are Indra and Indrani on their elephant, and below is a female figure holding a chowry. The upper part of the compartment is filled with small figures in the attitude of adoration.\n\nOn the other side of the Trimurti is another compartment, with various figures of Siva and Parvati his wife; the most remarkable of which is Siva, in his vindictive character; eight-handed, with a chaplet of skulls round his neck. On the right of the entrance of the cave is a square apartment, supported by eight colossal figures; containing a gigantic symbol of Mahadua or Siva, cut out of the rock. There is a similar chamber in a smaller cavern, which is almost filled with rubbish, but having the walls covered with sculpture.\n\nThe pillars and figures in the cave have been defaced by visitors, and by the zeal of the Portuguese, who made war on the gods and temples, as well as on the armies of India. Fragments of statues strew the floor, columns deprived of their bases are suspended from the roof, and there are others split and without capitals.\n\nThe cave at Elephanta, originally dedicated to Siva, is not now in use as a temple, nor is it a place of pilgrimage, or possessed of a sacerdotal establishment; although neighbouring individuals make occasional offerings of prayers and oblations. Considering the pains bestowed on it, it must at some period of time have been held in greater estimation; but the Brahmins in general disregard imperfect or mutilated images. (M. Graham, Goldingham, Moor, &c.)\n\nEllore, (Elura).\u2014One of the Northern Circars or districts, situated principally between the 16th and 17th degrees of north latitude.\n\nEllore and Condapilly occupy the whole of the space between the Krishna and the Godavery; the districts of Masulipatam towards the sea; the inland province of Commin towards the west; and the jeel, or lake of Colair, which is chiefly formed by the overflowings of the above two rivers. Its superficial contents may be estimated at 2700 square milcs, exclusive of the high mountainous region on the west. The principal towns are Ellore, Coifareotta, and Gundgoli.

They are described at great length in the sixth volume of the Asiatic Researches, and appear, like other similar excavations, to have been dedicated to Siva or Mahadeva.\n\nThe Brahmins on the spot assert that they were formed by Eeloo Rajah of Ellichpoor 7914 years ago; but, as they are found in the neighbourhood of Deoghir or Tagara, (now Dowletabad), which, prior to the Mahommadan conquest in 1293, was the capital of a powerful Hindoo principality, they probably originated in the superstition of some of the family reigning at that place. (Malet, Rennel, &c.)\n\nEllichpoor, (Elichpur).\u2014A town in the province of Berar, of which it is the proper capital, Nagpoor being of recent date, and situated in the adjoining province of Guandwana.

E.\n\nIn 1645 an expedition was fitted out from Batavia, for the purpose of examining this island, which terminated in entrapping and carrying off 60 or 70 of the inhabitants, male and female. The former died soon after their arrival at Batavia, refusing to eat any other food than cocoa nuts; but the women, who were distributed among the principal families of Batavia, proved tractable and docile.\n\nIn 1771 it was visited by a vessel sent by the governor and council of Bencoolen, to explore its productions. Owing to the petty thefts of the natives, and the imprudent conduct of the crew, hostilities arose between them two days after their arrival, which frustrated the purpose of the expedition. On approaching the shore large plantations of cocoa nut trees were discovered, with several spots of ground cleared for cultivation on the hills. Canoes came off to the ship, with cocoa nuts, sugar canes, toddy, and a species of yam.\n\nThe inhabitants are taller and fairer than the Malays, their hair black, which the men cut short; and the women wear long, and neatly turned up. The former go entirely naked, except that they sometimes throw a piece of the bark of a tree or plantain leaf, over their shoulders, to protect them from the heat of the sun. The latter go also naked, except a piece of plantain leaf round their waist. The ears of both men\nand women have large holes made in them, an inch or two in diameter, into which they put a ring made of cocoanut shell, or a roll of leaves. They do not chew betel, nor is their language yet ascertained.\n\nTheir canoes are formed of thin planks sewn together, sharp pointed at each end, provided with outriggers, and capable of containing six or seven men. They always carry lances, not only as offensive weapons, but for the purpose of striking fish. These lances are about seven feet in length, formed of hard woods; some of which are tipped with pieces of bamboo made sharp, and the concave part filled with fish bones and sharks teeth. Some lances are armed with pieces of bone made sharp and notched, and others pointed with bits of iron and copper sharpened.\n\nThe soil of the country is for the most part a red clay, and the productions the same as are usually found on the coast of Sumatra. No rice has been seen among the inhabitants, nor have cattle or fowls of any kind been observed about their houses; which are circular, raised on posts, floored with planks, and about eight feet in diameter. The Malays, who are much addicted to the marvellous, formerly believed that the inhabitants of this island were all females. (Marsden, &c.)\n\nEnore, (Enur).\u2014A village in the Carnatic, eight miles north from Madras, situated on the banks of a small salt water lake, which contains abundance of fine fish and excellent oysters. Lat. 13\u00b0. 18'. N. Long. 80\u00b0. 26'. E. A society in Madras have built here by subscription a house on the edge of the lake, where there is a weekly meeting to eat fish, play cards, and sail on the lake in pleasure boats; a diversion which cannot be enjoyed anywhere near Madras, on account of the surf. The town stands on a flat sandy bank, and contains about 100 huts of the natives, and two European houses, besides the subscription-house. (M. Graham, &c.)\n\nEtaweh.\u2014A town in the province of Agra, situated in the Doab of the Ganges and Jumna, and about the 27th degree of north latitude. Along with the rest of the Doab it was ceded to the British by the Nabob of Oude in 1801; when a civil establishment for the administration of justice, and collection of the revenue, was fixed at Etaweh, subordinate to the Bareilly court of circuit and appeal.\n\nEtaweh.\u2014A town in the province of Agra, 70 miles S.

E.\n\nThis place is situated on a very high bank of the River Jumna, many parts of which, during the dry season, are 60 feet high. The town is built on the heights, and, as it ap-\nproaches the river, is divided into a number of separate hills by deep ravines. The Jumna is here a large river, with many islands of sand, which are overflowed during the rains.

E.\n\nFirozenagur.\u2014A district in the Nizam's dominions, in the province of Beeder, extending along the north side of the Krishna River, and situated between the 16th and 17th degrees of north latitude. The principal towns are Firozgur, Alpoor, and Sooropoor.\n\nFloris Isle, (Ende).\u2014A large island in the Eastern Seas, situated between the eighth and ninth degrees of south latitude, and the 120th and 123d of east longitude. In length, it may be estimated at 200 miles, by 36 miles the average breadth. The proper name of this island is Ende, it having been denominated Floris by the early Portuguese writers, and after them by succeeding voyagers and geographers. The interior parts of Floris are mountainous and woody, but near the sea coast is a fine open country; our information, however, with respect to this large island is extremely scanty and imperfect. Over the greater part of this island, the Birma language prevails, which is related in some respects to the Buggess and Javanese. At the village of Larantooca in the straits, which separate Floris from Sabraon and Solor, European vessels procure refreshments in exchange for ammunition, coarse cutlery, and other small articles. Formerly sandal wood in considerable quantities might be procured here, but at present very little; which,\nwith wax, and occasionally ambergris, compose the exports of the island. At an early period the Portuguese frequented this island, but it does not appear they ever established any regular settlement; although there are still persons calling themselves Portuguese, and professing the Roman Catholic religion, scattered over the island. In the Straits of Mangeray, which separate this island from Comobo, the best ports for ships are on the Floris side. (Bligh, Leyden, Milburn, &c.)\n\nFormosa, (Tywan).\u2014A large island lying off the south-east coast of China, distant 100 miles, between the 23d and 26th degrees of north latitude. In length it may be estimated at 180 miles, by 50 miles the average breadth. The proper name of this island is Tywan, though called Formosa by Europeans.\n\nThe Dutch, at an early period, established a settlement on this island, and exercised considerable authority. In 1625 the Viceroy of the Philippines sent an expedition, which landed on that part of Formosa next the Island of Luzon, where they erected fortifications in order to oppose the Dutch, and also to propagate the Roman Catholic religion. In 1630 the Dutch governor, Neyts, treacherously seized some Japanese vessels, which were afterwards liberated by the address and bravery of their crews. Prior to this period the island does not appear to have been subject to the Chinese empire.\n\nAbout the middle of the 17th century it afforded a retreat to 20 or 30,000 Chinese, who were unwilling to submit to the Tartar conqueror. These refugees carried on a great and lucrative trade with their countrymen in China, and produced considerable revenue to the Dutch government, every person above seven years of age paying a capitation tax of half a guilder a month. The island also being at no great distance from Japan, the Dutch Company's factory had an advantageous trade with that empire.\n\nIn 1653 the Chinese inhabitants of Formosa entered into a conspiracy against the Dutch, which was suppressed with the assistance of the original natives. Soon after this, Coxinga, the governor of the maritime province of Tehichiang in China, applied for permission to retire to the island with his followers, to escape the invaders, but permission was refused by the Dutch governor. Coxinga, in consequence, ordered all the Chinese on the island to join him on the continent, which summons was obeyed by one half; and, in order to distress the rest, he prohibited all intercourse, and declared war against the Dutch. Two years afterwards peace was re-established, but Coxinga, finding his situation in China insecure, determined to establish a more independent sovereignty in Formosa; and, in consequence, resolved to invade that island, being encouraged by the ruinous state of the Dutch fortifications.\n\nIn March he arrived at Tywan, or Formosa, with a fleet of 600 vessels, and made himself master of the town and adjacent country, and afterwards besieged Fort Zealand. The Dutch made several ineffectual efforts to relieve it, but were each time repulsed with considerable slaughter. At length the governor, Wesburgh, having sustained a close siege as long as it was possible to resist, was obliged to surrender the 5th of July, 1661, and the survivors of the garrison were allowed to embark on board the Dutch ships. This was a severe blow on the Dutch East India Company, as while they retained Formosa they could control the commerce of the Spaniards, Portuguese, and Chinese, and had a place of refreshment for their ships trading to Japan.\n\nCoxinga, not long after he had completed the conquest, engaged in a war with the Emperor of China on the main land, and was defeated and slain in a naval engagement by the united fleets of the Dutch and Chinese. His followers withdrew from\nthe coast of China in 260 vessels, but the place of their subsequent retreat has never been ascertained. Notwithstanding this victory the allies could make no impression on Formosa, it was so well defended by Coxinga's uncle, Savia, and afterwards by his son, Tching King May.\n\nAfter Coxinga's death it is probable that the dynasty continued to be distinguished by his name, as the records of the English East India Company, in 1671, mention a war between the King of Java, and Coxsin, the chief of Formosa, whose power, at that period, controled the King of Jambee on Sumatra, and of Johore on the Malay Peninsula. In 1676 the English East India Company had a factory on Formosa, the chief object of which was, through this medium, to effect a trade with Japan. At this time the principal exports from Formosa were fine copper and gold, both probably procured from Japan.\n\nIn the year 1683 the reigning prince, Tching Ki San, voluntarily surrendered his dominions to the Emperor of China, who settled a pension on him. The Chinese having thus easily acquired Formosa, garrisoned it with a strong body of troops, and with them it has remained until within these few years.\n\nIn 1805 the Ladronne pirates had acquired possession of a great part of the south-west coast of Formosa, which exported a great deal of grain to the province of Fokin in China. (Maepheron, Bruce, Zuniga, Kruensenstern, &c.)\n\nFort William.\u2014See Calcutta.\n\nFort St. David.\u2014A town on the sea coast of the Carnatic, 100 miles S.S.W. from Madras, and 15 S.S.W. from Pondicherry. Lat. 11\u00b0.46', N. Long. 79\u00b0.57'. E. Three considerable rivers, coming from the westward, gain the sea in the space of four miles within the bounds of Fort St. David. The bed of the Panaur lies about 1800 yards to the north of the River of Tripapole, and the two communicate by a canal which runs nearly parallel to, and about 1000 yards distant from, the margin of the sea. Fort St. David stands in the angle where the canal joins the River of Tripapole, which passes close to the site of the fort, and then sends to the south an arm that soon joins the River of Bandapollan, when both united in one channel continue along the eastern side of Cuddalore, separated from the sea by a mound of sand.\n\nThis factory was first established in 1691, when the Court of Directors ordered a purchase to be made from the Ram Rajah of a new settlement at Tegnapatam, which was carried into execution, and named Fort St. David, the territory acquired being larger than that belonging to Madras.\n\nIn 1693 it was discovered, that a plot had been arranged by Dr. Blackwell, the surgeon to the garrison, to deliver up Fort St. David to Zulficar Khan, the general of Aurengzebe, then besieging the Ram Rajah in Gingee; in recompence for which he was to receive a large sum of money, and be made governor of Porto Novo. He was seized and carried to Madras, where he made full confession; when it appeared the plot comprehended the seizure of the whole of the English settlements. In 1702 the ground rent of Fort St. David was farmed for 2805 pagodas, and the tobacco and betel nut for 2756 pagodas.\n\nAfter the capture of Madras, in 1746, by the French under M. La Bourdonnais, the English factory retired here, and were again besieged, but without success. From this period it continued the head of the English settlements on the Coromandel Coast until 1758, when it was taken by M. Lally after a short siege. On this event the French completely demolished the fortifications, which were never rebuilt. For this they afterwards suffered severe retribution when Pondicherry was taken. (Orme, Bruce, Wilks, &c.)\n\nFortified Island, (Baswa Rasa\nDurga.\u2014A small island, about a mile in circumference, on the coast of North Canara, a little way north from the entrance into Onore Lake. Lat. 14\u00b0. 16'. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 27'. E.\n\nIt was originally fortified by Sireppa Nayaka, the Rajah of Ikeri, but was greatly strengthened by Tippoo, who intended to make it his naval arsenal. When taken from him, in 1792, by three British frigates, the garrison consisted of 200 men, and 34 pieces of cannon, with provisions and ammunition in proportion. Besides the military stores and pepper there were found here 20 tons of iron spikes for building, with almost the whole of the iron work for a 60 gun ship, and some lesser naval stores. The ship for which this preparation was made was nearly completed, but had been scuttled and sunk in the river at Onore on the commencement of hostilities.\n\nThis island contains cocoa nut, palms, and plantain trees, with abundance of fresh water.

A considerable number of them he settled here, and from this circumstance the name of the place originated, but none of their descendants now remain. During the height of the rainy season, the vast expanse of water here appears like an inland sea, and the depth is very great.

The depth of water in this part of the route, during the month of August, is from four to six fathoms, and there are many villages scattered on each side of the river. The natives of Sinde assert, that the Fulalee, at some distance to the north of Hyderabad, communicates with the Indus, forming an island of the country round the city of Hyderabad. This island, named Gungah, near the banks of the river, is, in many places, well cultivated, which is also the case with the opposite side.

This small district extends along the western\nbank of the Ganges, and was surrounded by the dominions of the Nabob of Oude, to whom the Patan chief of Furruckabad was tributary. In 1801, by an arrangement with the former, the tribute payable by the latter was transferred to the Company; and, in 1802, the civil and military government of the country were assumed, making an allowance to the Nabob of Furruckabad of 180,000 rupees per annum.\n\nPrior to this period the state of the country was most wretched. Murders were so frequent, that the inhabitants did not dare to venture out after sunset; and the workmen who came out of the British military cantonments always retired to their own houses during daylight. Since the transfer the robbers have been extirpated, and owing to the security of property, the value of the lands have greatly risen. It would be easy to prove that the great bulk of the inhabitants of every part of India have reason to rejoice at coming under the British control, but the blessings to this small district in particular are incalculable.

E.\n\nThis town was built by a Patan colony about 100 years ago, and is situated at a short distance from the west side of the Ganges. The streets are wide, and the houses and open places are shaded with trees. A considerable trade is carried on, and the town rendered flourishing by the vicinity of the British cantonments. On the cession of the district, in 1802, by the Nabob of Oude, a civil establishment for the administration of justice, and collection of the revenue, was settled here, subordinate to the Bareily court of circuit and appeal.\n\nTraveling distance from Lucknow 111 miles, from Benares 755, from Calcutta by Birboom 755 miles.

The space within does not appear ever to have been filled with buildings, and the part now inhabited is but an inconsiderable village. The neighbouring hills are composed of a greyish stone, and have supplied the materials of which the town is built. On the most elevated part of the rock stands the tomb of Shah Selim Cheestee, by the efficacy of whose devotion the Empress of Akbar, after remaining several years barren, became pregnant, and bore a son, who, in honour of the saint, was named Selim; and, on ascending the throne of Hindostan, took the name of Jehangeer.

A strong glare is reflected during the day, and the wind is dry and extremely parching. A few lye shrubs are scattered over this tract. Two miles E. N. E. from Gahrah the country improves, and there is a plain three miles in extent, and capable of cultivation, remaining in a state of nature. (Maxfield, &c.)\n\nGANGES, (Ganga).\u2014Prior to the commencement of the 19th century the Ganges had been traced by Hindu pilgrims from Hindostan into the snowy mountains, which run in a direction north west to south east, on the frontiers of India; and, on the side of Tibet, had been approached by Lama surveyors, whose route terminated at Kentaisse, a range of snowy mountains on the west and south of Tibet. The intervening space was a region of conjecture and romance. Whether a vast tract of Alpine country intervened, or simply a ridge of lofty mountains clothed in eternal snow, which last position seemed the most probable.\n\nUntil 1807 all the maps represented this river flowing within the Himalaya chain of snowy mountains many hundred miles, from an imaginary lake, named Mapama, to Gangoutri. This course appeared to Mr. Colebrooke, and the late Lieut. Col. Colebrooke, to rest on very slender foundations. They thought it very improbable that a stream less than the Alacananda, as the Bhagirathi was represented to be, should have its source so much more remote than the larger stream; and that flowing (as was supposed) for many hundred miles through a mountainous region, it should receive no greater accessions from mountain torrents. Praun Poori, the Sanyass\u00e9e, had, prior to this, also declared, that the river at Gangoutri, which was visited by him on his return from Cashmere, was so narrow, that it might be leaped over; which is incompatible with the notion of a distant source of the river. So narrow a stream could be only a mere brook or rivulet, whose remotest source, these gentlemen conjectured, must be only a few miles distant.\n\nTo verify these conclusions Lieut. Webb was sent by the Bengal go-\nGovernment, in 1808, to survey the sources of the Ganges; and the information acquired by him determined him to assign them a situation south of the Himalaya Mountains. His reasons for adopting this opinion he has published, the principal of which are,\n\n1st. That it had universally been experienced during his journey, that the supply of water from springs and tributary streams was sufficient, in a course of eight or 10 miles, to swell the most minute rivulet into a considerable and unfordable stream.\n\n2dly. The course of the Ganges and Alakananda Rivers was followed, until the former became a shallow and almost stagnant pool, and the latter a small stream; and both having, in addition to springs and rivulets, a considerable visible supply from the thawing of the snow. It is therefore concluded from analogy, that the sources of these rivers could be little, if at all removed from the station at which these remarks were collected.\n\nNo doubt, therefore, can remain, that the different branches of the river above Hurdwar take their rise on the southern side of the Himalaya chain of snowy mountains; and it is presumable, that all the tributary streams of the Ganges, including the Sarjew or Goggrah, and the Jumna, whose most conspicuous fountain is at little distance from the Ganges, also rise on the southern side of that chain of mountains.\n\nEvery account agreed that the source of the Ganges is more remote than the place called Gangoutri, which is merely the point whence it issues from Himalaya, not, as related, through a secret passage or cavern, resembling a cow's mouth; but its current is perceptible beyond that place, although the access be so obstructed as to exclude further research. The pilgrims, and those persons who reside within a few miles of Gangoutri, and who gain a livelihood by bringing the water from the spot, say that the road beyond Gangoutri is passable only for a few miles, when the current is entirely concealed under heaps of snow, which no traveller ever has surmounted or can surmount.\n\nAfter issuing from the mountains near Hurdwar, to the conflux with the Jumna at Allahabad, the first large river that joins it, the bed of the Ganges is generally from a mile to one and a quarter miles wide. From hence its course becomes more winding, and its bed wider, until having successively received the Goggrah, the Soane, and the Gunduck, besides many smaller streams, its channel attains its full width, as it afterwards in some parts becomes so narrow as half a mile; and, where no islands intervene, is in some places three miles wide. When at its lowest, the principal channel varies from 400 yards to one and a quarter miles wide, but is commonly about three-fourths of a mile in breadth.\n\nThe Ganges is fordable at some places above its conflux with the Jumna, but the navigation is never interrupted. At 500 miles from the sea the channel is 30 feet deep when the river is at the lowest; which depth continues to the sea, where the sudden expansion of the stream deprives it of the force necessary to sweep away the bars of sand and mud thrown across it by the strong southerly winds, so that the principal branch of the Ganges cannot be entered by large vessels.\n\nAbout 200 miles from the sea (but 300, reckoning the windings of the river) commences the Delta of the Ganges. The two westernmost branches, named the Cossimbazar and Jellinghy rivers, unite and form afterwards what is named the Hooghly River, which forms the Port of Calcutta, and the only branch of the Ganges that is commonly navigated by ships. The Cossimbazar River is almost dry from October to May; the Jellinghy River, although a stream, runs in it during the whole year, is in some years unnavigable.\nduring two or three of the driest months; so that the only subordinate branch of the Ganges that is at all times navigable for boats is the Chandnah River, which separates at Moddapoor, and terminates in the Hooringotta River. That part of the Delta bordering on the sea is composed of a labyrinth of rivers and creeks, named the Sunderbunds, which, including the rivers that bound it, give an expansion of 200 miles to the branches of the Ganges at its junction with the sea.\n\nThe descent of the river is about nine inches per mile; but the windings are so great as to reduce the declivity to less than four inches per mile. In the dry season the mean rate of motion is less than three miles per hour. In the wet season, and while the waters are draining off from the inundated lands, the current runs from five to six miles an hour; and there are instances of its running seven and eight miles in particular situations.\n\nThe Ganges appears to owe its increase as much to the rain that falls in the mountains, as to that which falls in the plains of Hindostan, for it rises $15\\frac{1}{2}$ feet out of 32 feet (the sum total of its rising) by the latter end of June, and the rainy season does not properly begin in most of the flat countries until about that time. In the mountains the rains begin early in April; and, by the latter end of that month, when the rain water has reached Bengal, the rivers begin to rise by very slow degrees, the increase being only one inch per day for the first fortnight. It then gradually augments to two and three inches before any quantity of rain falls in the low countries; and when the rain becomes general its increase, at a medium, is five inches per day. By the latter end of July all the lower parts of Bengal are overflowed contiguous to the Ganges and Brahmapootra, and form an inundation of more than 100 miles in width, nothing appearing but villages and trees, and here and there the artificial site of an abandoned village, appearing like an island.\n\nOwing to the quantity of rain that falls in Bengal, the lands in general are overflowed to a considerable height long before the bed of the river is filled, the ground adjacent to the river bank, to the extent of some miles, being higher than the rest of the country. There are particular tracts guarded from inundation by dikes, which are kept up at an enormous expense; yet do not always succeed, owing to the want of tenacity in the soil of which they are composed. It is calculated that the length of these dikes, collectively, exceeds 1000 miles.\n\n### Table of the Increase of the Ganges and its Branches.\n\n| AT JELLINGHY | ft. in. | ft. in. |\n|--------------|--------|--------|\n| In May       | 6      | 2     |\n| June         | 9      | 4     |\n| July         | 12     | 6     |\n| In the first half of August | 4 | 11 |\n\nFeet 32 0 14 3\n\nThe inundation is nearly at a stand in Bengal for some days preceding the 15th of August, when it begins to run off, though great quantities of rain still continue to fall during August and September; but a decrease of rain has by this time taken place in the mountains, and a consequent deficiency in the supplies to keep up the inundation. The daily decrease of the Ganges, during the latter half of August and September, is from three to four inches; from September to the end of November it gradually lessens from three inches to one and a half inches; and from November to the end of April is only half an inch per day at a medium.\n\nApproaching the sea from the limits to which the tide reaches, the height of the periodical increase gradually diminishes, until it totally disappears at the point of confluence with the sea. The ocean preserving\nat all times the same level, necessarily influences the level of the waters that communicate with it. At Luckipoor there is a difference of about six feet between the height in the different seasons; at Dacca and places adjacent 14; and at Custce of 31 feet. The latter place is about 240 miles from the sea by the course of the river; and the surface of the river there is, during the dry season, 80 feet above the level of the sea at high water.\n\nThe quantity of water discharged by the Ganges, in one second of time, during the dry season, is 80,000 cubic feet; but the river when full, having twice the volume of water in it, and its motion being accelerated in the proportion of five to three, the quantity discharged that season is 405,000 cubic feet. Taking the medium of the whole year, it will be nearly 180,000 cubic feet per second of time.\n\nIn Bengal the banks of the Ganges exhibit a variety of appearances, according to the nature of the soil, or the degree of force with which the current strikes against them. In those parts where the velocity of the stream is greatest, and the soil extremely loose, they become perpendicular, and crumble in so frequently, as to render it dangerous to approach them. The bank is often excavated into a number of deep bays, with projecting points between them, round which the current rushes with great rapidity; but is considerably slackened, and has even a retrograde motion in the interior part of the gulf. In the higher parts, where a conker soil (a hard, reddish, calcareous earth) prevails, the banks of the Ganges are not so liable to be undermined.\n\nThe Rajemal Hills, from which several rocky points project into the river, as at Sierygully, Pointy, and Pattergotta, have for ages opposed effectually the encroachments of the river. The depth of the water in the navigable part of the Ganges, not far from Colgong, is frequently upwards of 70 feet; yet in this neighbourhood new islands have risen to more than 20 feet above the level of the stream. The quantity of land which has been destroyed by the river in the course of a few years, from Colgong to Sooty, will amount, on a moderate calculation, to 40 square miles, or 25,600 square acres; but this is counterbalanced, in a great measure, by the alluvion which has taken place on the opposite shore, and by the new island of Sundeeep, which alone contains above 10 square miles.\n\nIn its course through the plains the Ganges receives 11 rivers, some of which are equal to the Rhine, and smaller than the Thames, besides some a great many others of lesser note. The largest tributary streams to the Ganges in Bengal and Bahar are the Goggrah, the Soane, and the Coosy, or Cosa. Such of these rivers as are narrowest are remarkable for their windings; the larger rivers having a tendency to run in more direct lines.\n\nWithin the space of 100 miles the Ganges, by the winding of its course, is calculated to increase the distance to 125 miles.\n\nThe Goggrah, or Dewah, to 112 miles.\n\nThe Hooghly from Calcutta to Nuddea increases from 60 to 76 miles.\n\nThe Goompty, from its outlet upwards, increases from 100 to 175 miles.\n\nThe Issamutty and Jaboona, from Dewangunge to Bansetullah, increase from 100 to 217 miles.\n\nAlthough the sources of the Brahmapootra have never been explored, it is probable they are separated from those of the Ganges only by a narrow range of snow-clad peaks, about the 32d degree of north latitude, and the 82d of east longitude. From hence they direct their courses towards opposite quarters, until they are more than 1200 miles asunder; but afterwards meet and intermix their waters before they join the sea, the Ganges having then performed a\njourney, including the windings, of about 1500 miles.\n\nIt is only that part of the river which lies in a line from Gaugoutri, where its feeble stream issues from Himalaya to Sagor Island, below Calcutta, that is particularly sacred, and named the Gunga, or Bhagirathi. The Hooghly River, therefore, of European geographers is considered the true Ganges; and the great branch that runs east to join the Brahmapootra is, by the Hindoos, called Puddah (Padma) or Padmawati, and is not by them esteemed equally sacred. Although the water of the whole river from Gangoutri to Sagor is holy, yet there are places more eminently sacred than the rest, and to these pilgrims from a distance resort to perform their ablutions, and to take up the water that is used in their ceremonies.\n\nThe chief of these are the five Prayags, or holy junctions of rivers, of which Allahabad is the principal, and by way of distinction named simply Prayag. The others are situated in the province of Serinagur, at the confluence of the Alacananda, with different small rivers, and are named Devaprayaga, Rudraprayaga, Carnaprayaga, and Nandaprayaga. The other sacred places are Hurdwar, where the river first escapes from the mountains; Uttara Janagiri, a short distance below Monghir and Sagor Island, at the mouth of the Calcutta River, named by Europeans the Hooghly. Besides its sanctity, the Ganges is much esteemed for its medicinal properties, and is on this account drank by many Mahomedans. In 1792 Abd ul Hakeem, the reigning Nabob of Shanoor, near the west coast of India, although at the distance of more than 1000 miles from this river, never drank any other water.\n\nIn the Hindu Mythology Ganga (the Ganges) is described as the eldest daughter of the great mountain Himavata; her sister Ooma as the spouse of Mehadeva, the destroying power.\n\nShe is called Ganga on account of her flowing through gang, the earth; she is called Jahnavi from a choleric Hindoo saint, whose devotions she interrupted on her passage to the sea, and, in a fit of displeasure, he drank her entirely up; but was afterwards induced, by the humble supplications of the Devas (demi-gods), to discharge her by his cars.\n\nShe is called Bhagirathini from the royal devotee Bhagaratha, who, by the intensity and austerity of his devotions, brought her from heaven to the earth, from whence she proceeded to the infernal regions, to reanimate the ashes of some of his ancestors.\n\nShe is called Triputhaga, on account of her proceeding forward in three different directions, watering the three worlds\u2014heaven, earth, and the infernal regions.\n\nAccording to the Brahminical Mythology, the sea, although dug before the descent of the Ganges from heaven, is, by the Hindoos, supposed to have been empty of water.

Buchanan, Moor, &c.)\n\nGangpoor.\u2014A small district in the province of Gundwana, situated about the 22d degree of north latitude, and bounded on the north by the British district of Chuta Nagpoor, in Bahar. During the reign of Aurungzebe, it was formally annexed to the Souhab of Allahabad, although but in nominal subjection to the Mogul dominion. It is a barren, mountainous, and unproductive territory, and still possessed by native zemindars. The chief river is the Soank, and the principal towns Gangpoor and Padah.\n\nGangpoor.\u2014A town possessed by independent zemindars, in the province of Gundwana, the capital of a small district of the same name.

Long. 78\u00b0 9'. E.\n\nAt this place the breadth of the Ganges is about 15 or 20 yards, the current moderate, and not above waist deep. Two miles further on is the place called the Cow's Mouth. It is a large stone in the middle of the bed of the river, the water passing it on each side, and disclosing a small piece above the surface, to which fancy may attach the idea of a cow. The river runs from the direction of N. by E. and on the bank, near Gangoutri, is a small temple, about eight or 10 feet high, containing two or three images representing the Ganges, the Bhagirathi, &c. There are three coonds, or basins, where the pilgrims bathe, called Brahmacoond, Vishnucoond, and Suryacoond, formed in the bed of the river.\n\nIn 1808 Lieutenant Webb and his party approached within 16 or 18 miles horizontal distance from this place; but, on account of the extreme difficulty of the road, and want of time, could proceed no further. This short distance was reckoned a journey that would occupy six or seven days. The pilgrims, and other persons in the vicinity, who gain a livelihood by bringing water from the spot, say, that the road beyond Gangoutri is passable only for a few miles, where the current is entirely concealed under heaps of snow, which no traveller ever has surmounted, or can surmount.\n\nThe pilgrimage to Gangoutri is considered a great exertion of Hindu devotion; the performance of it is supposed to redeem the performer from troubles in this world, and insure a happy transit through all the stages of transmigration which he may have to undergo. The water taken from hence is drawn under the inspection of a Brahmin, to whom a trifling sum is paid for the privilege of taking it. It is afterwards offered up by, or on the part of the pilgrim, at the temple of Baidya-\n\nnath, a celebrated place of worship in Bengal. The specific gravity of this river is said to exceed that of the neighbouring river the Alacananda, according to Hindoo belief, and is so pure, as neither to evaporate, nor to become corrupted by being kept. The mountains in the vicinity of Gangoutri have a very barren appearance, the only tree produced being the Bhrunjapatra.

The fort is a small pentagon on plain ground; and, when properly garrisoned, capable of making a considerable resistance. Sugar and jagary are cultivated in this neighbourhood, but the country to the north of Ganjam is very low, and under water during the rains. Ganjam is now one of the five districts into which the Northern Circars have been subdivided, and the residence of a judge and collector. The Bengal revenue of judicial system was introduced in 1804.\n\nThe principal towns for the coasting trade in this district are Ganjam, Munsurcutta, Sonapoor, Barvah, Calingapatam, and Banpanapados; at which ports, between the 1st of May, 1811, and the 30th of April, 1812, 83 vessels and craft, measuring 9470 tons, arrived; and 206, measuring 25,802, departed.\n\nThe total value of imports at Ganjam, during the above period, was 106,250 rupees, of which only 6414 rupees was from places beyond the territories subject to the Madras government, and the whole of this from Calcutta. The total value of the exports, within the same period, was 471,503 rupees, of which only 8553 rupees was to places beyond the territories of the Madras government, viz.\n\nTo Calcutta - - 3157\nTo Botany Bay - 5396\n\nArcot Rupees 8553\nDistance from Calcutta 372 miles; from Madras 650.

It is bounded on the north by Rangamatty, and on the east by Assam; but its proper limits have never been correctly ascertained.\n\nThe country is hilly, but very fertile, and tolerably well inhabited. One of the chief villages is Ghosegong. There are rivers at the several passes into the hills, the principal of which are the Nati, the Maharishi, the Sumaserry, and the Mahadeo. These rivers are of a sandy, gravelly bottom, with much limestone and iron ore. The Mahadeo has abundance of coals, the oil of which is esteemed, in the hills, a cure for cutaneous disorders. There are but few sorts of fish in the rivers, but the common river turtle are to be had in great numbers.\n\nA Garrow is a stout, well-shaped man, hardy, and able to do much work. They have a surly look, a flat cally nose, small eyes, generally blue or brown, wrinkled forehead, and overhanging eyebrow, with a large mouth, thick lips, and round face. Their colour is of a light or deep brown. The women are extremely ugly, short, and squat in their stature, with masculine features. In their ears are fixed numbers of brass rings, sometimes as many as 30, increasing in diameter from three to six inches. The females work at all laborious occupations.\n\nThe Garrows eat all manner of food; even dogs, frogs, snakes, and the blood of animals, which last is baked over a slow fire, in a hollow green bamboo. They have various sorts of spirits, which they drink to excess, but the most common is extracted from rice. Their animal food they eat almost raw.\n\nThe houses of the Garrows, called chaungs, are raised on piles, three or four feet from the ground; in length from 30 to 150 feet, by from 10 to 40 in breadth. The props of the house consist of large sail timbers, over which large timbers are placed horizontally, and the roofs are finished with bamboos, mats, and strong grass. The latter are uncommonly well executed, particularly in the houses of the boneahs, or chief men. The house consists of two apartments, one floored, and raised on piles; the other without a floor, at one end, for their cattle. The chiefs wear silk turbans, but their apparel is generally covered with bugs.\n\nThe Garrows are of a mild temper and gay disposition. In regulating their dances, 20 or 30 men stand behind one another, holding each other by the sides of the belts, and then go round in a circle, hopping first on one foot, and then on the other. The women dance in rows, and hop in the same manner. During their festivals they eat and drink to such a degree, that they require a day or two afterwards to become perfectly sober. Marriage is generally settled by the parties themselves, but sometimes by their parents. If the parents do not accede to the wish of their child, they are well beaten by the friends of the other party, and even by persons unconnected with either, until they acquiesce in the marriage. Among this people the youngest daughter is always the heiress. If her husband die, she marries one of his brothers;\nand, if they all die, she marries their father.\n\nThe dead are kept four days, and then burned. If the deceased be an upper-hill chief of common rank, the head of one of his slaves should be burned with him; but if he happen to be a chief of the first rank, a large body of his slaves sally out from the hills, and seize a Hindoo, whose head they cut off, and burn with their chief. Their religion appears to approach that of the Hindoos. They worship Mahadeva, and at Banjann, a pass in the hills, they worship the sun and moon. Their punishments consist mostly of fines, which are appropriated to festivity and drunkenness. In their debates, their wives have as much to say as the chiefs.\n\nAt the foot of the Garrow Hills reside a tribe of people called Hajins, whose customs nearly resemble those of the Garrows; but, in religion, partake more of the Hindoo, as they will not kill a cow. By the Hajin caste the tiger is worshipped. (Elliot, Leyden, &c.)\n\nGaukarna.\u2014A town in the province of North Canara. Lat. 14\u00b0. 32'. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 25'. E. This town is very much scattered among coconut palms, and contains above 500 houses, of which one half is occupied by Brahmins, who highly esteem Gaukarna, on account of an image of Mahadeva, named Mahabollisvara. About six miles to the north is Gangawali, an inlet of fresh water, which separates the Hindoo geographical division, named Haiga or Haiva, from Kankana (Concan). Canoes can go several miles up this stream to the foot of the Ghauts. The salt made in this part of the country, where there are the same natural advantages as at Goa, is very bad, and scarcely saleable at market. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nGaungra.\u2014A district belonging to the Nagpoor Maharattas, in the province of Berar, situated about the 22d degree of north latitude. It is bounded on the north and south by hills, and intersected by the Tuptee River, but very little is known respecting it.\n\nGautumpoor, (Gautamapur).\u2014A town in the province of Allahabad, 65 miles S. W. from Lucknow. Lat. 26\u00b0. 10'. N. Long. 80\u00b0. 15'. E. The boundary in this quarter, betwixt the provinces of Allahabad and Agra, commences near to this town. (Abul Fazel, &c.)\n\nGawelgur, (Gayalghur, or Ghoragwul).\u2014A strong fortress in the province of Berar, 32 miles N. N. W. from Elllichpoor. Lat. 21\u00b0. 46'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 52'. E.\n\nThis fortress stands on a high and rocky hill, in the midst of that range of mountains which lies between the sources of the Poornah and the Tuptee rivers. There is one complete inner fort, which fronts the north, where the rock is most inaccessible; and this citadel is strengthened and defended by an outer fort, which entirely covers it to the north and west. The outer fort has a thick wall, which covers the approach to it by the north from the village of Lambada\u2014all of which walls are strongly built and fortified by ramparts and towers.\n\nTo the whole of the fortification there are three gates; one to the south, which leads to the inner fort; one to the north, which leads to the outer fort; and one to the north, which communicates with the third wall. The ascent to the first gate is very long, steep, and difficult; that to the second is by a road used for the common communications of the garrison with the country to the southwards, but which leads no further than the gate. It is extremely narrow, the rock being scooped out on each side, and, from its passing round the west side of the fort, is exposed to its fire for a considerable distance. The road to the northern gate is direct from the village of Lambada, and the ground along which it is made is level with that of the fort.\n\nNotwithstanding this formidable\nlist of defences, it was taken by storm, after a siege of two days, on the 14th Dec. 1803, by the army under the command of General Wellesley and Colonel Stevenson. On the 25th of the same month peace was concluded with the Nagpoor Rajah, to whom it was restored. (5th Register, &c.)\n\nGAYA (PULO) ISLE.\u2014A small island off the N. W. coast of Borneo, six or eight miles in circumference, and being very near the main land, appears from the sea to be part of it. Lat. 7\u00b0. N. Long. 116\u00b0. 2'. E. Near to this island are many smaller, such as Pulo Pangir, Pulo Udar, Pulo Prin, &c.\n\nGAYAH, (Gaya).\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, district of Bahar, 55 miles south from Patna. Lat. 24\u00b0. 49'. N. Long. 85\u00b0. 5'. E.\n\nAbout 14 miles to the north of this place is a hill, or rather rock, in which is dug a remarkable cavern, now distinguished by the name of Nagunjence. It is situated on the southern declivity, about two-thirds from the summit. Its entrance is six feet high, and two and a half broad, and leads to a room of an oval form, with a vaulted roof, 44 feet in length, 18 in breadth, and 10 in height at the centre. This immense cavity is dug entirely out of the solid rock, and the same stone extends much further than the excavated part on each side of it, and is altogether full 100 feet in length.\n\nOn the interior part were two inscriptions without dates, which have been translated by Charles Wilkins, Esq. and published in the first volume of the Asiatic Researches. From the characters they appeared to have been of considerable antiquity. In the adjoining hills are several other caves.\n\nThis town is one of the holy places of the Hindoos to which pilgrimages are performed, having been either the birth-place or residence of Buddha, the great prophet and legislator of the nations east of the Ganges. From this circumstance it is usually termed Buddha Gayah. The Bengal government derive from the pilgrims resorting to Gayah a net annual revenue of about one and a half lacks of rupees, (16,000L.) which is more than at Juggernaut, without the slightest interference of the officers of government with the priests of the temple. Their respective rights of succession to the different duties of the temple are left to be determined by themselves. (Harrington, Wilkins, East India Reports, &c.)\n\nGAZGOTTA, (Gajacata, the Elephant Fort).\u2014A small town in the province of Bengal, district of Rungpoor. Lat. 25\u00b0. 50'. N. Long. 89\u00b0. 15'. E.\n\nGAZYPOOR, (Ghazipur).\u2014A district in the province of Allahabad, zemindary of Benares, situated about the 26th degree of north latitude. It is bounded on the north by the Gogragh; on the south by the Ganges; on the east by the Gogragh; and on the west by Jionpoor. It is remarkably well supplied with water, and one of the most fertile in India. It has been long celebrated for the excellence of its rose water. In 1582 it is described by Abul Fazel as follows: \"Sircar Gazypoor, containing 19 mahals, measurement 288,770 beegahs, revenue 13,431,300 dams. Seyurghal 131,825 dams. This sircar furnishes 310 cavalry, and 16,650 infantry.\"\n\nThis district formerly composed a separate collectorship; but subsequent to the introduction of the Bengal code into the Benares province, the judicial establishment at Gazypoor was withdrawn, and the country divided between the jurisdictions of the provincial courts of Junapoor, Mirzapoor, and the city of Benares. The chief towns are Gazypoor, Azimpoor, and Dooryghaut.\n\nGAZYPOOR.\u2014A town in the province of Allahabad, 41 miles N. E. from Benares, the capital of a district of the same name. Lat. 25\u00b0. 35'. N. Long. 83\u00b0. 33'. E. Here are cantonments for three regiments of\ncavalry. At the end of the town is a place formerly belonging to Saadet Ali, the Nabob of Oude, overhanging the River Ganges, which is here wide, and the current slow.\n\n**Gebey Isle**, (or Gibby).\u2014An island in the Eastern Seas, surrounded by a cluster of smaller islands, situated on the west side of the Gilolo passage, between the 129th and 130th degrees of east longitude. In length it may be estimated at 25 miles, by three the average breadth. It is inhabited, but has never been completely explored. The rise and fall of the tides here, at the springs, is only five feet.\n\n**Gellicunda**, (Jalakhanda).\u2014A town in the Northern Carnatic, 65 miles N. W. from Nellore. Lat. 15\u00b0. 4'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 12'. E.\n\n**Gentiah**, (Jevointa).\u2014A small district possessed by independent chiefs, situated on the N. E. quarter of the Bengal province, bounded on the south by the district of Sylhet, and on the north by the Garow Mountains. The Company's regulations do not extend to this district, but a small tribute is annually received. The inhabitants are Hindoos of the Brahminical persuasion.\n\n**Gentiah**.\u2014A town beyond the eastern limits of the Company's provinces, the capital of a small district of the same name. Lat. 25\u00b0. 10'. N. Long. 91\u00b0. 54'. E. Near to this place, in 1774, an action was fought between a detachment of the Company's troops and the forces of the native chief.\n\n**George Town**.\u2014The chief town of Prince of Wales Island, bounded on the north and east by the sea; on the south by an inlet of the sea; and on the west by the high road. The streets are spacious, and cross each other at right angles.\n\n**Gergonge**, (Ghirigrama).\u2014The principal town in the province of Assam, and the usual residence of its monarchs. It is situated considerably above Rungpoor in Assam, on the opposite side of the high banks of the Dekhow River. Lat. 25\u00b0. 35'. N. Long. 93\u00b0. 10'. E. Since the insurrection of the Moamarias the city, palaces, and fort, have continued a heap of ruins. This place is also named Ghergong, Gurgown, and Kirganu. (Wade, Remmel, &c.)\n\n**Gertokh**.\u2014A town in Tibet, being the market where the exports from the Nepanese territories are bartered for the productions of that country. The articles brought to Gertokh are grain, inspissated treacle, oil, sugar, cottons, chintzes, iron, brass, lead, woollens, pearls, coral, cowries, conch shells, dates, and almonds.\n\nGertokh sends to Lahdack, for the Cashmerian market, shawl wool, the produce of Tibet; to Nepaul and Hindostan, gold dust, silver in wedges, musk, fur, scented leather, shawls, china ware, tea in cakes, salt, borax, drugs, and small horses. (Webb, &c.)\n\n**Ghassa**.\u2014The capital of a district in Bootan, and the station of a zoompon, or provincial governor. Lat. 28\u00b0. N. Long. 89\u00b0. 3'. E. The highest mountains in this neighbourhood are covered with snow throughout the year, and are visible from Cooch Bahar to Purneah. At the base of the loftiest is a spring of water, so hot as scarcely to admit of bathing. (Turner, &c.)\n\n**Ghauts, Eastern**.\u2014The chain of hills commonly described under this appellation commences in the south, about Lat. 11\u00b0. 20'. N. to the north of the Cavery, and extends with little interruption, or comparative deviation, from a straight line to the banks of the Khrisna in Lat. 16\u00b0. N separating the two Carnatics; the one named the Carnatic Balaghaut, or above the Ghauts, (the true Carnatic); the other the Carnatic Payeenghaut, or below the Ghauts, extending along the Coast of Coromandel. The term ghaut properly signifies a pass through a range of high hills, but the name has been transferred to the mountainous chains, which support the centrical table land in the south of India.\nWe are not yet informed of the exact height of this ridge. About the latitude of Madras, which is the highest part, it is estimated at 3000 feet; and Bangaloor, which is within the chain, was found by barometrical observation to be 2901 feet above the level of the sea. As the rivers which have their sources in the upper table land universally decline to the east, it is probable that the Western Ghauts are higher than the Eastern, and they are by far the most abrupt in their elevation.\n\nThe grand component parts of these mountains is a granite, consisting of white felspar and quartz, with dark green mica in a small proportion to the other two ingredients. The particles are angular, and of a moderate size. The rocks appear stratified, but the strata are very much broken and confused.\n\nThe country above the Eastern Ghauts, about Naiekan Eray, rises into swells like the land in many parts of England, and is overlooked by the high barren peaks of the Ghauts, which close the view to the eastward. The soil between Naiekan Eray and Vincatagherry is very poor, and covered with copse, having a few large trees intermixed. The whole of the copse land serves for pasture of an inferior sort, and the bushes supply the natives with fuel for domestic purposes, and for smelting iron. About two miles from Naiekan Eray a torrent in the rainy season brings down from the hills a quantity of iron ore in the form of black sand, which, in the dry season, is smelted. Each forge pays a certain quantity of iron for permission to carry on the work.\n\nThe tops of the hills near the Vellore road by Sauthur are covered with large stones, among which grow many small trees and shrubs, with occasionally a tamarind tree of great age and size. The scenery here exhibits a great contrast to that about Madras, the whole country being undulated with a few lofty desolated peaks; the whole appearing very barren, and without any extensive forests. This pass has been widened and levelled since Mysore was conquered by the British. Artillery can now ascend it with little difficulty, which was far from the case when Lord Cornwallis made his first and unsuccessful attempt on Seringapatam. The tranquillity of the Mysore and Carnatic, by the final abolition of the Mahommedan dynasty of Hyder, has increased the importance of an easy communication between the two countries. (F. Buchanan, Lord Valentia, Rewell, &c.)\n\nGhauts, Western.\u2014This chain of mountains extends from Cape Comorin to the Tuptee, or Surat River, where they do not terminate in a point, or promontory; but, departing from their meridional course, they bend eastward in a wavy line parallel to the river, and are afterwards lost among the hills in the neighbourhood of Boorhaupoon. In its line along the Tuptee this ridge forms several passes, or ghauts, from which there is a descent into the low country of Khandesh. In their whole extent the Western Ghauts include 13 degrees of latitude, with the exception of a break in the ridge, about 16 miles wide, in the latitude of Paniyany, through which the River Paniyany takes its course from the Coimbatoor province. Their distance from the sea coast is seldom more than 70 miles, commonly about 40, and are frequently visible from the sea. Within one short space betwixt Barcelore and Mirjaow they approach within six miles of the sea.\n\nThe altitude of these hills is sufficiently great to prevent the body of the clouds from passing over them, and accordingly the alternate N. E. and S. W. winds (called the monsoons) occasion a rainy season on the windward side of the mountains only. This cause ceases to operate in the parallel of Surat, when the S. W. wind, no longer opposed by a wall of mountains, carries its supply of moisture without interruption over the whole surface of the country. The\ncountry above the Ghauts is called a table land, but it is not a regularly flat level country; being, on the contrary, in many parts very mountainous.\n\nThe Western Ghauts, about the 15th degree of north latitude, although steep and stony, are by no means rugged, or broken with rocks. The stones in the neighbourhood of Cutaki are buried in a rich mould, and in many places are not seen without digging. Instead, therefore, of the naked, sun burnt, rocky peaks, so common in the Eastern Ghauts, there are here fine mountains covered with stately forests. There are nowhere finer trees, nor any bamboos that can be compared with those that grow in this part of Western Ghauts. The bamboos, composing a great part of the forest, grow in detached clumps, with open spots between, and equal in height the most lofty palms. Near Cutaki, about half way up the Ghauts, the teak becomes common, but it is of an inferior size.\n\nThe difficulty formerly experienced in ascending these mountains from the Malabar and Canara Coast, may be conceived from that which the Bombay army had to surmount in Dec. 1791, when advancing to the Mysore by the Poodicherrim Pass. It required two days to drag up 20 light field pieces two miles, and three weeks to bring up 14 guns with their tumbrils, none heavier than 18 pounders, to the top of the Ghauts.\n\nThe proper name of the Western Ghauts is Sukhien Purbut, or Hills of Sukhien. (Remmel, F. Buchanan, Moor, Dirom, Duncan, &c.)\n\nGhepp, (or Dun Ghepp).\u2014A district in the province of Lahore, situated principally between the 32d and 33d degrees of north latitude. It is bounded on the N. W. by the Sohan, and on the S. E. by the Jhyium rivers. This district is remarkable for the quantity of fossil salt it contains, which is an article of considerable export to the more eastern and southern provinces of Hindostan. The principal towns are Pirhala, Muckealah, and Varsha; and the country generally is partly under the jurisdiction of the Afghans, and partly occupied by the Seiks.\n\nGherial, (Ghirija, flowing from a Mountain).\u2014A small river in the province of Bejapoor, which rises in the Western Ghauts, and, after a short course, falls into the sea near the town of Gherial, in the Concan district.\n\nGheroud.\u2014A town in the province of Khandesh, 120 miles N. W. from Boorhaupoor, belonging to the Maharattas. Lat. 21\u00b0. 58'. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 19'. E.\n\nGherian, (or Corepatam).\u2014A fortress situated on a promontory of rocky land in the Concan province, about one mile long, and quarter of a mile broad. Lat. 16\u00b0. 33'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 6'. E. This rock is joined to the continent by a narrow neck of sand, and lies one mile from the entrance of a large harbour, formed by the mouth of a river which descends from the Western Ghauts.\n\nIn 1707 Conajee Angria had established an independent sovereignty here, and possessed a numerous piratical fleet. It was taken, in 1756, by Admiral Watson and Colonel Clive, and all Angria's fleet destroyed. After the capture it was discovered, that notwithstanding the cannonade from the ships had destroyed most of the artificial works upon which they fired, the rock remained a natural and almost impregnable bulwark. There were found in it 200 pieces of cannon, six brass mortars, and a great quantity of ammunition, and naval and military stores. The money and effects of other kinds amounted to 120,000l. sterling, which was divided among the captors, without any reserve either for the nation, or for the Company. This place now belongs to the Maharatta Peshwa. (Orme, Bruce, Malet, &c.)\n\nGhinouly.\u2014A small village consisting of three huts, situated a little\nto the north of the Sewalic Mountains, in the southern quarter of the province of Serinagur. Lat. 29\u00b0. 55'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 32' E. The villages in this neighbourhood seldom consist of more than five or six huts, and it is a large village that has 10. (Hardwicke, &c.)\n\nGHIZNI.\u2014A district in the province of Kabul, situated between the 33d and 34th degrees of north latitude. The surface of the country is considerably elevated above the level of the sea, and the climate so cold as to be proverbial. The land to the west of the city of Ghizni at Hoerghaut is interspersed with low hills, and, except a few cultivated spots, produces little else than a prickly aromatic weed, on which camels feed with avidity; and which, with paste of unsifted barley, formed into balls, constitutes their common food. These camels carry a load of about 800 pounds English. This district, like the rest of Afghanistan, is very thinly populated. The principal towns are Ghizni, Kurabaugh, and Gurdaiz. (Foster, &c.)\n\nGHIZNI.\u2014A celebrated city in the province of Kabul, once the capital of a powerful empire. Lat. 33\u00b0. 36'. N. Long. 68\u00b0. 22' E.\n\nThe town stands on a hill of moderate height, at the foot of which runs a small river. Its existence is principally supported by some Hindu families, who carry on a small traffic, and supply the wants of a few Mahomedan residents. At a short distance stands the tomb of Mahmood, to which pilgrims resort from distant places. On account of the number of holy men who lie entombed here, Ghizni is emphatically called by the Mahomedans the second Medina.\n\nThis city continued the capital of a powerful empire for the space of four centuries, and was greatly adorned by the Ghiznavi princes, especially by Sultan Mahmood. The splendid buildings have long been levelled with the dust, and except some scattered masses of misshapen ruins, not a monument is to be seen of Ghizni's former grandeur.\n\nThe first Ghizni sovereign was Nassir ud Deen Schuetagi, who ascended the throne A.D. 975, and repeatedly invaded India.\n\nA.D.\n\n997 Emir Ismael.\n997 Sultan Mahnood.\n1028 Sultan Mahomed.\n1028 Sultan Massood.\n1041 Emir Modood.\n1049 Abu Jalif Massood.\n1051 Sultan Abd ul Rasheed.\n1052 Ferokh Zad.\n1058 Sultan Ibrahim.\n1098 Alla nd Dowlah.\n1115 Arsalan Shah.\n1118 Ryram Shah.\n1152 Khsru Shah.\n1159 Khsru Mallek.\n1271 Shaheb ud Deen Mahomed Ghori, who subdued the city and empire of Ghizni, and expelled the race of Schuetagi, which retired to Lahore, and there continued to reign for some time; but, about the year 1185, became extinct.\n\nGhizni for many years afterwards was a capital city, but gradually declined to a secondary rank, and at last to total insignificance.\n\nTravelling distance from Delhi by Kabul 917 miles; from Kabul 82 miles. (Foster, Rennel, Wilford, Maurice, &c.)\n\nGUHORGRAUT.\u2014A fort in the western extremity of the Gujrat Peninsula, situated about half way between Muddee and Pindtaruk, and on the east side of the Bun, to which it serves as a barrier, a strong garrison being always kept in it by the Jam of Noanagur.\n\nGHOSEGONG. (Goshagrama).\u2014The principal village in the Garrow country, on the western frontier of Bengal, situated on the west side of the Naatee River. At this place a great number of Garrows have their dwellings at the foot of a pass, near to which are the villages of Ghosegong, Ghoonia, and Borack. Ghosegong consists of chaungs, or houses, from 30-\nThe soil in this vicinity is a fine black earth, intermixed with spots of red earth; and the rice, in many places, is equal to the Benares long rice. The mustard seed is twice as large as that of Bengal, and the oil it produces is of an excellent quality. The hemp is equally good. The pasture for cattle is good, and the glue produced is of an excellent quality. (Eliot, &c.)\n\nGhoubund, (Ghorband).\u2014A town and small district in the province of Kabul, situated near the Hindoo Kho Mountains, 50 miles W. N. W. from Kabul. Lat. 34\u00b0. 55'. N. Long. 67\u00b0. 53'. E. In the time of Acher the Hazarchi tribe, Maidani, in conjunction with a Turkman tribe, occupied the district of Ghoubund. Abul Fazel describes it as containing mines of silver and lapis lazuli, and producing an inconceivable variety of fragrant shrubs and flowers. (Abul Fazel, Leyden, &c.)\n\nGhyseabad.\u2014A town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Malwah, 56 miles S. from Chatterpoor. Lat. 24\u00b0. 8'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 56'. E.\n\nGiaritchas Isles.\u2014A cluster of five small islands, lying about six miles S. S. W. from Makian. They are of a middling height, and contain many bare rocks, intermixed with green spots and trees.\n\nGilion Isle.\u2014A small island about 30 miles in circumference, lying off the east end of Madura Island. Lat. 7\u00b0. 5'. S. Long. 114\u00b0. 40'. E.\n\nGilly Sinde, (Jala Sindhu).\u2014A river in the province of Malwah, which has its source in the Vindhya Mountains, and afterwards flows in a northerly direction, but attains to no great magnitude. After a short course it falls into the Sepra River, and proceeds with it to join the Chumbul.\n\nGilolo, (or Halmahera).\u2014A large island in the Eastern Seas, of a most irregular shape, being composed of four peninsulas, separated from each other by deep bays. It lies between the parallels of three degrees north and one south latitude, and may be estimated at 220 miles in length, by 30 the average breadth.\n\nThis island is naturally very fertile, and abounds with bullocks, buffaloes, goats, deer, and wild hogs; but the sheep are few. The inhabitants subsist mostly on the sago or libby tree, which, like the cocoa nut tree, has no distinct bark that peals off. It may be described as a long tube of hard wood, about two inches thick, containing a pulp or pith, intermixed with longitudinal fibres of from two to 400 pounds weight. From this pith is procured the sago flower, which is the general food of the inhabitants. It is said, that east of Gilolo there are no horses, horned cattle, or sheep.\n\nWhile the Dutch influence existed among the isles, to prevent the smuggling of spices they discouraged the inhabitants of Jilolo from trading with Celebes, Bouro, Oby, Ceram, Mysol, and Salwatty; and also rooted out the spices in places of easy access, or near the sea. They also forbid the manufacturing of cloth; but the natives continued to make it, procuring their cotton from Bally and the Buggess country. In 1774 the northern part of Jilolo belonged to the Sultan of Ternate. The imports are principally from the Dutch settlements and the neighbouring islands, and consist of opium, coarse cutlery, piece goods, china ware, and iron; the exports are spices, biche de mar, bird nests, tortoise-shell, seed pearl, and sago. (Forrest, &c.)\n\nGingee, (Jhini).\u2014A district in the Carnatic, situated between the 12th and 13th degrees of north latitude. It is bounded on the east by the sea, along which is the travelling road from Madras to Pondicherry. This territory is less populous and more jungly than Tanjore and the\nSouthern Provinces, which escaped the ravages of Tippoo and his father, Hyder, the effect of which is still felt about Gingee. This district is now comprehended in the southern division of the Arcot collectorship.\n\n**Gingee.\u2014** A town in the Carnatic, the capital of a district of the same name, 82 miles S. W. from Madras, and 37 N. W. from Pondicherry. Lat. 12\u00b0. 15'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 34'. E.\n\nThe fort stands on a stupendous rock, and is impregnable by the ordinary modes of attack. The natives of India, who esteem no fortifications very strong, unless placed on high and difficult eminences, have always regarded Gingee as the strongest town in the Carnatic. The mountain of Gingee has always been deemed extremely unhealthy; and it is said, the French, who never kept more than 100 Europeans complete here, lost 1200 during the 10 years it was in their possession.\n\nThis fortress was either built or improved on an old foundation of the Chola kings, by the son of Vijaya Runga Naik, the governor of Tanjore, in 1442. It was successively strengthened by the Mahommedans of Bejapoor, who possessed it from 1669 to 1677; by the Maharattas, who held it from 1677, when it was taken by Scavjee, during a sudden irruption into the Carnatic, to 1698. At this period it was besieged and taken by Zulficar Khan, the imperial general, who appointed Rajpoot governors, who affected independence, and assumed the rank of rajas. In 1715 it was held by Saadet Oollah Khan; and, in 1750, was taken by surprise during a night attack by the French under M. de Bussy. After the capture of Pondicherry, it surrendered by capitulation to Captain Steven Smith, in April, 1761. (Wilkes, Orme, &c.)\n\n**Girout.\u2014** A town in the province of Agra, district of Etaweh, 48 miles E. from Agra. Lat. 27\u00b0. 13'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 44'. E.\n\n**Goa, (Govay).\u2014** A town in the province of Bejapoor, and the capital of the Portuguese possessions in India. Lat. 15\u00b0. 30'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 42'. E.\n\nGoa consists of two distinct cities, to which the name is applied. The old city is about eight miles up the river, but is now almost deserted by the secular Portuguese, it being unhealthy, and the seat of the inquisition. It contains many magnificent churches, and exhibits specimens of architecture, superior to anything attempted by Europeans in any other part of India, particularly the cathedral and the church and convent of the Augustines. Over the palace gate of the city is the statue of Vasco de Gama.\n\nThe viceroy and chief Portuguese inhabitants reside at new Goa, which is at the mouth of the river, within the forts of the harbour. Formerly a considerable trade in the manufacture of arrack was carried on here, but it has been almost entirely transferred from Goa to Batavia. The Goa arrack is made from the vegetable juice of the palm tree, called toddy; the Batavia arrack is made from rice and sugar. While the Portuguese European trade lasted it was carried on entirely on account of the king, there being no accounts extant of voyages from Portugal to India for account of individual Portuguese merchants. In 1808 it was estimated that there were 200 churches and chapels in the province of Goa, and above 2000 priests. Including the islands, the Portuguese still possess territory in the neighbourhood of Goa, 40 miles in length by 20 in breadth.\n\nGoa was taken from the Hindoo Rajahs of Bijanagur by the Bhameecee sovereigns of the Deccan about 1469; and in 1510 was besieged and taken by Albuquerque, when he strengthened the fortifications, and made it the capital of the Portuguese possessions in the east. He was recalled in 1518, at which period the Portuguese power had reached its greatest height, and from\nthat time declined. It does not appear that they ever possessed any considerable extent of territory, although they kept on foot a large army of Europeans; and they may be said rather to have disturbed and pillaged India than to have carried on any regular commerce.\n\nIn 1580 the Portuguese possessed the following places in India, viz. Diu, Damaun, Choul, Basseein, Salsette, Bombay, and Goa; They had factories at, and influenced the government of, Dabul, Onore, Barcelore, Mangalore, Cananore, Calicut, Cranganore, Cochin, and Quilon. They had several establishments on the maritime parts of Ceylon, and factories in the Bay of Bengal, at Mansulipatam, Negapatam, and St. Thomas, with commercial stations in the province of Bengal. In addition to these they possessed the city of Malacca, and had trading factories in the countries which compose the modern Birman empire and the province of Chittagong. In the Eastern Archipelago they possessed the trade of all the spice islands, and a considerable intercourse with Japan and China; but they did not acquire Macao until 1586.\n\nAfter the conquest of Portugal, in 1580, by Philip the Second of Spain, the connexion betwixt the Portuguese settlements and the mother country was very much loosened, and the intercourse abridged. In the three years (1620 to 1622) that Hernan de Albuquerque was viceroy, he never once received any letter of instruction or information from the court of Spain; the colonies must consequently have been supported entirely from their own resources, while involved in a destructive war with the Dutch. The vices of their internal government and exorbitant power of the priests assisted to hasten their decay. The viceroy never had any power over the inquisition, and was himself liable to its censure.\n\nThe settlement of Goa seems now almost wholly abandoned by the mother country, and its inhabitants scarcely speak their national language intelligibly. Their poverty is such, that women of the best families earn their subsistence by making lace or artificial flowers, and working muslin. The remaining Portuguese possessions are Goa, Damaun, Dhelli, on the Island of Timor, and Macao in China.\n\nA small trade subsists betwixt Goa and the mother country, but it is frequently interrupted for a great length of time. With Macao and with the British settlements a small commerce is also carried on, the imports consisting principally of piece goods, raw silk, grain, sugar, woolens, and a few European articles; the exports are piece goods, betel nut, hemp, and other articles of little amount.\n\nTravelling distance from Poonah, 245 miles; from Bombay, 292; from Delhi, 1158; and from Calcutta, 1300 miles. (C. Buchanan, Bruce, Elmore, Milburn, Macpherson, Ferishta, M. Graham, Perron, &c.)\n\nGOAHUTEE, (Gohati, Cow-market).\u2014A town in the province of Lower Assam, of which it is the capital. The surrounding district occupies an extent of hilly country on both banks of the Brahmapootra. The hills on each side form a spacious amphitheatre, which has been equally well fortified by nature and by art. (Wade, &c.)\n\nGOACH, (Goak).\u2014The capital town of the Macassar country, in the Island of Celebes, which is sometimes called the Kingdom of Goach. Lat. 5\u00b0 13'. N. Long. 119\u00b0 21'. E. In 1512, subsequent to the arrival of the Portuguese, the Malays were allowed to build a mosque at Goach, the natives not being yet converted to the Mahommedan religion. In 1778 this city was taken by assault by the Dutch, the fortifications raised, and the government new modelled. Prior to this period the sovereign of Goach was not despotic, but was obliged to consult his nobility regarding the performance of any important regal\nfunction, every township having a chief nearly independent. (Stavorius and Notes, Marsden, &c.)\n\nGOALPARAH, (Govalpara).\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Rangamatty, situated on the south side of the Brahmapootra, near the frontiers of Assam, 170 miles north by east from Dacca. Lat. 26\u00b0. 8'. N. Long. 90\u00b0. 32'. E.\n\nThis is the principal mart of intercourse with the Assamese, who bring here coarse cloths, stick lac, tar, wax, and occasionally gold for barter. Salt is the article they in general take in return, which is delivered to them very much adulterated. Neither is this traffic so considerable as might be expected, owing to the disorderly state of the Assam country and savage manners of the chiefs, who frequently settle unadjusted accounts by the assassination of their creditors.\n\nGOCANK.\u2014A town in the province of Bejapoor, 47 miles S. by E. from Moritich. Lat. 16\u00b0. 20'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 6'. E.\n\nThis is a town of considerable extent and importance, situated on the eastern acclivity of a hill, and is watered on its northern side by the Gutpurba River, which immediately opposite is deep water; but there is a ford a mile eastward of the town. Gocank is enclosed by a wall and ditch on its eastern and southern sides; but to the westward it is commanded by a hill.\n\nHere is an extensive manufactory of silk and cotton, both in the form of dresses and of piece goods. The silk is probably procured from Bengal by the way of Goa. Gocank was the head place of a district in 1685, when taken by Sultan Manzzum; but it does not now contain any buildings or ruins of consequence. About two miles from this place is a superb cataract, formed by the River Gutpurba, which is precipitated from the hills to the low country. During the rains this river is about 169 yards broad, which volume of water falls perpendicularly 174 feet. In the dry season the breadth is comparatively small. (Moor, &c.)\n\nGODAVERY RIVER, (Gadavari, named also Guiga Godavery).\u2014This river has its source in the Western Ghauts, about 70 miles to the north east of Bombay. After traversing the province of Aurungabad and the Tilligana country from west to east, it turns to the south east, and receives the Baingunga about 90 miles above the sea, besides many lesser streams in its prior course. At Rajamundry it separates into two principal branches, and these subdividing again, form altogether several tide harbours for vessels of moderate burthen; such as Ingeram, Coringa, Yanam, Bundermalanca, and Narsipoor, all situated at different mouths of this river. Its whole course, including the windings, may be estimated at 850 miles in length, having nearly travelled across from sea to sea.\n\nAt Collysair Ghaut, in the province of Gundwana, Lat. 18\u00b0. 38'. Long. 80\u00b0. 35'. E. the bed of the Godavery is about a mile in breadth; and, in the beginning of May, consists of a wide expanse of sand, the river being divided into many little streams, nowhere more than 15 inches in depth. In the rainy season the bed is filled, and the river rolls along a prodigious volume of water. After its separation near Rajamundry it forms the Island of Nagur, which comprehends about 500 square miles, and is, on account of its fertility, of great value in proportion to its extent. (Rennel, J. Grant, Illust., &c.)\n\nGOELWARAH, (Gavelparah).\u2014A district in the province of Gujrat, situated between the 21st and 22d parallels of north latitude, and bounded on the east by the Gulf of Cambay. The chief town is Gogo, from whence the inhabitants, who are mostly Mahomedans, carry on a brisk trade with Bombay in their own vessels. The greater part of this, adjacent to the Gulf of Cambay, was ceded to the British government by the Guj-\ncowar in 1805, in part payment of the subsidiary force supplied for his protection.\n\n**Gogorah River, (Gharghara).**\u2014This river has its source in the mountains to the north of Hindostan, but the exact situation has never been ascertained. It afterwards falls into the Sareyu (Sarjew) at Swargadwara, the united streams afterwards being named indifferently the Gogorah, Sarjew, or Deva River. This river flows through the district of Kemaon and province of Oude, and forms one of the largest contributory streams to the Ganges, which it joins in the province of Balhar. In the Hindoo Mythological poems this river is always mentioned by the name of the Sareyu, which in modern times it has almost lost. Its banks were esteemed by the ancient Hindoos of peculiar sanctity, and were much frequented by Viswamitra and other powerful and choleric Hindoo saints. Major Rennel thinks it is the Agoramis of Arrian.\n\n**Gogo, (Goga).**\u2014A town in the province of Gujrat, district of Goelwara, situated on the west side of the Gulf of Cambay. Lat. 21\u00b0 43'. N. Long. 72\u00b0 12'. E.\n\nThis is a safe roadsted during the S.W. monsoon, to which vessels may run in case of parting from their anchors in Surat Roads, it being an entire bed of mud, about three-fourths of a mile from the shore, and always smooth water. Ships may here get supplied with stores and provisions, and repair any damages they may have sustained. The natives, who are principally Mahommedans, build vessels from 50 to 300 tons, and carry on a brisk trade with Bombay in their own craft, the chief export being cotton. The lascars of this place are named siddhees, and are reckoned the best on the west coast of India. The trade of this place had been much on the decline, but since its cession to the British by the Guicowar, the commerce has revived, and the population is increased. In 1582 it is described by Abul Fazel as follows:\n\n\"Ghogeh is a large port, well built, and inhabited by merchants. Ships come to, and others are fitted out from this place. The cargoes of ships are put in small vessels, which transport them to Cambayet. In this neighbourhood are remarkably fine oxen, some of which are sold for 300 rupees a pair and upwards, according to their beauty and speed.\" (Elmore, Abul Fazel, Malet, Drummond, &c.)\n\n**Gohud.**\u2014A district in the province of Agra, situated to the south of the Chumbul, between the 26th and 27th degrees of north latitude. The territory possessed by the Rannah of Gohud is mountainous, but fertile; and in 1790 was supposed to produce a revenue of 22 lacks of rupees annually, out of which seven went to the expenses of collection. The country abounds with strong positions, particularly the famous fortress of Gualior. The principal towns are Gohud and Gualior.\n\n**Gohud.**\u2014A fortified town in the province of Agra, 65 miles S.W. from the city of Agra, and the capital of a small district of the same name. Lat. 26\u00b0 21'. N. Long. 78\u00b0 21'. E.\n\nAbout the middle of last century Gohud was a small village, attached to the district of Gualior, and the rannah's ancestors were zemindars of this village, and by caste Jauts of the Bamrowly tribe. Bhoom Singh, the Rannah, prior to the battle of Paniput, in 1762, acquired Gualior, but was compelled to yield it to the Maharattas. When this nation lost the great battle of Paniput, the Rannah of Gohud attempted to shake off their yoke, but was subdued by Ragoonauth Row in 1766, and compelled to continue tributary. On a subsequent rupture Gohud was taken by Madhajee Sindia in 1784.\n\nOn the 17th of January, 1804, a treaty was arranged by the British government with the Rannah of Gohud, Kirrat Singh Luckindra, by\nwhich he was to be established in the sovereignty of Gohud, Gualior, and a considerable number of adjacent districts; in consideration of which he was to receive and maintain a subsidiary force of three battalions, and make over the city and fortress of Gualior to the British. From the inability of the rajah to settle the above countries, and fulfil his engagements, the whole was declared null and void, and another concluded on the 19th of December, 1805, by Graeme Mercer, Esq. on the part of the Bengal government; by the conditions of which the rajah agreed to relinquish the country and fort of Gohud, and the other districts guaranteed to him by the former treaty, to be disposed of as might appear expedient.\n\nThe British government, from the consideration that the failure of the former treaty, on the part of the rajah, had arisen from inability and want of means, determined to make an adequate provision for him, and, in consequence, granted him the districts of Dholepoor, Barec, and Rajekerah, in perpetual sovereignty. No engagements were, however, entered into for his support in these possessions, and he was, consequently, left entirely to his own resources; the British government, by a new species of policy, declining all interference with him, internally or externally, and disclaiming all responsibility for the assistance or protection of the territory it had bestowed on him; recommending him to adjust all his disputes in the manner most convenient to him. Gualior and the Gohud districts have ever since been harassed, possessed by, or tributary to, Dowlet Row Sindia. (3d and 7th Registers, Treaties, &c.)\n\n**Golconda**, (Golkhanda). \u2014 A strong fortress, situated on a hill, about six miles W. N. W. from Hyderabad. Lat. 17\u00b0. 18'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 35'. E. The principal inhabitants and bankers of Hyderabad are permitted by the Nizam to have houses in this fort, to which they retire with their money on any alarm.\n\nGolconda was once the capital of an extensive kingdom, first under native Hindoo princes, and afterwards a principal division of the Bhanencee sovereignty, upon the fall of which it again became the seat of a monarchy under the Cutub Shahee dynasty. In the year 1690 it was surrendered, by treachery, to the Mogul army of Aurungzebe, after a siege of seven months. The deposed sovereign, Abou Honssun, died in confinement here in 1704. (Scott, Upton, &c.)\n\n**Gomano Isle.**\u2014A small island, about 20 miles in circumference, situated due south of Oby Island, from which it is separated by a narrow strait. Lat. 1\u00b0. 55'. S. Long. 127\u00b0. 40'. E.\n\n**Goochnauthi.**\u2014A village in the province of Gujrat, district of Werrear, situated on the south bank of the Bunass River, about three miles S. E. from Rahduropoor. The country immediately adjacent is in a high state of cultivation, and the fields in some places enclosed. This village belongs to the Nabob of Sommee.\n\n**Goodoor.**\u2014A town in the Balaghaut ceded territory, 10 miles W. by S. from the town of Carnoul. Lat. 15\u00b0. 46'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 51'. E.\n\n**Goochaut, (Gohat).**\u2014A town in the Afghan territories, in the province of Cabul, 12 miles W. of the Indus. Lat. 32\u00b0. 51'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 40'. E.\n\n**Goolpussra.**\u2014A town in the Nepaul dominions, through which the commerce between Patna and Nepaul passes, although a much more circuitous route than that of Bharoch. Lat. 27\u00b0. 1'. N. Long. 85\u00b0. 10'. E.\n\nThis place stands on the skirts of the great forest, and is but a mean village, although the thoroughfare for most of the merchandise that passes between Nepaul, Benares, Oude, and Patna, over the Cheesupany Mountains. The road from\nhence to Bechiacori, through the great forest, is practicable for wheel carriages, and there are two or three stations, but no villages on the way. This part of the forest contains the same variety of trees as the Jhuryhoory quarter. Some of the sall trees measure 100 feet below the branches, and from eight to nine feet in girth. (Kirkpatrick, &c.)\n\nGoolgunge.\u2014A town in the province of Allahabad, district of Bundelcund, 26 miles S. S. E. from Patna. Lat. 24\u00b0. 26'. N. Long. 85\u00b0. 38'. E. Near to this place is a pass into the hills, named Goomaghaut.\n\nGoomsur, (Gomakeswara).\u2014A town at the north-west extremity of the Northern Circars, 43 miles N. W. from Ganjam. Lat. 19\u00b0. 53'. N. Long. 84\u00b0. 55'. E.\n\nThe country in this neighbourhood is remarkably impenetrable, the forests consisting entirely of bamboos, which grow closer, and resist the axe better, than any other species of vegetation. In former times, the inhabitants relying on this, did not think it necessary to erect redoubts for the defence of the paths to their strong holds, but obstructed them with frequent barriers of bamboos, wrought into a variety of entanglements.\n\nThe whole district is esteemed one of the hottest regions in India, and is peculiarly subject to strokes of the sun, by which M. Bussy, in 1757, lost seven Europeans of his army in one day. (Orme, &c.)\n\nGoomty, (Gomati, Winding).\u2014This river has its source among the Kemaoon Hills, from whence it flows in a south-east direction; and, after passing the cities of Lucknow and Jionpoor, falls into the Ganges below Benares. It is named the Goomty from its extremely winding course, which being a circumstance very common to rivers flowing through the flat countries of Hindostan, there are many other rivers of a secondary class, distinguished by the same appellation, particularly one which passes Comillah, in the Tiperah district, and falls into the Megna, at Daoudcaundy.\n\nGoonee.\u2014A river in the province of Sinde, which flows in a north-westerly direction, and afterwards falls into the Indus. During the rains it is navigable for a considerable distance, and forms part of the route from Hyderabad, the capital of Sinde, to the port of Mandavie, in the Gulf of Cutch.\n\nGoondipooram.\u2014A town in the Northern Circars, 46 miles N. by W. from Cicacole. Lat. 18\u00b0. 59'. N. Long. 83\u00b0. 51'. E.\n\nGoonong Telloo.\u2014A town in the Island of Celebes, where the Dutch formerly had a settlement, situated on a river of the same name. Lat. 0\u00b0. 30'. N. Long. 123\u00b0. E. This place stands on the north side of the great Bay of Goonong Telloo, named also Tominie, which deeply indents the east coast of Celebes. The inhabitants are Malays, but their chief is named the rajah, which is a Hindu title, but not unfrequently appropriated by the petty Mahomedan princes in the Eastern Isles.\n\nGooracpoor, (Garakhpur).\u2014A district in the province of Oude, situated about the 27th degree of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by hills and forests, which separate it from the Nepaulese territories; to the south by the Dewah or Goggrah River; and on the east by the Gunduck. In 1801 this district was ceded to the British by a treaty concluded between the Nabob of Oude and the Marquis Wellesley. After this event, in order to promote a free intercourse with the people of the mountainous country to the north, and with Goracpoor, which is but thinly inhabited, periodical fairs were established, to which part of the Company's investment woollens and metals was sent. These fairs were also numerously attended by traders from the neighbouring provinces. The principal towns are Gooracpoor, Buckrah, and Mutgur. A considerable part of the country is still\novergrown with forests, in which sain trees of a large size abound.\n\nIn 1582 this district is described by Abul Fazel as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Gooracpoor, containing 24 mahals; measurement, 244,283 beegahs; revenue, 11,926,790 dams. Scyurghal, 51,235 dams. This sircar furnishes 1010 cavalry, and 22,000 infantry.\"\n\nGooracpoor.\u2014A town in the province of Oude, situated on the east side of the Rooree Rapti River, 170 miles travelling distance E. from Lucknow. Lat. 26\u00b0. 45'. N. Long. 85\u00b0. 22'. E.\n\nGooty, (Guti).\u2014A hilly district in the Balaghat ceded territories, situated principally between the 15th and 16th degrees of north latitude. Gooty is first mentioned as a district during the reign of Aurangzebe, when it formed part of a small state held by the predecessors of the Shahnoor family, who were dispossessed in 1758 by the Maharatta partisan chief, Morari Row. In the course of the three years' war between Hyder and the Maharattas, from 1776 to 1779, the province of Gooty was conquered by the former, and the rajah (who was never afterwards heard of) carried off prisoner. With the rest of the Balaghat it was ceded by the Nizam to the Company in 1800, and now forms part of the collectorship of Bellary. (Moor, &c.)\n\nGooty.\u2014A fortress in the Balaghat ceded territories, formerly the capital of a small district of the same name, and the seat of an independent Maharatta government. Lat. 15\u00b0. 9'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 35'. E.\n\nTravelling distance from Serinapatan, 228 miles, N. N. E.; from Madras, 269; and from Hyderabad, 178 miles. (Reynel, W.U.)\n\nGoragaut, (Ghoraghaut, the Horse Pass).\u2014A town and zemindary in the province of Bengal, district of Mymunsingh, 90 miles N. E. from Moorsabadabad. Lat. 25\u00b0. 13' N. Long. 89\u00b0. 10'. E. This small territory is also named Edraepoor, and anciently formed part of the division of Aurungabad. In 1784 it contained 632 square miles, and was held by a zemindar of the Khayst caste of Hindoos. In 1582 Abul Fazel describes it as producing raw silk, gunnies, and plenty of Tanyan horses.\n\nThis zemindary, with many others in the eastern quarter of Bengal, at a very early period of the Mahomedan invasion, was bestowed on different Afghan chiefs, who colonized in them, and received accessions of their brethren from abroad. Being zealous converters of the Hindoos in their neighbourhood, and not very scrupulous as to the means, a very considerable portion of the inhabitants of this remote corner, to this day, profess the Mahomedan religion, and dignify themselves with the Arabian title of Sheikh. The Ghoragaut Zemindary was subsequently seized on by the Kakeshelan tribe of Moguls. (J. Grant, Stewart, &c.)\n\nGoram Isle.\u2014A small island in the Eastern Seas, about 20 miles in circumference, and situated one day's sail E. by N. from Banda. This island is inhabited by Mahomedans, and is said to contain 13 mosques. In 1774 the Dutch sent an armed force of Buggesses against Goram, but they were repulsed by the inhabitants. (Forrest, &c.)\n\nGorcan, (Ghurka).\u2014A town and district in Northern Hindostan, the original country of the present Nepaul sovereigns, situated between the 28th and 29th degrees of north latitude. Prior to the conquest of Nepaul by Rajah Purthi Narain, of Ghoorka, the Triseolgunja separated the territories of the Ghoorkali and Newar (or Nepaul) princes, the western limit of the Ghoorka district being marked by the Mursiangdi.\n\nThis territory, besides a numerous peasantry of Dhenwars, contains several Rajpoot families, and some Newars, but it is principally occupied by the Brahminical and Khetri tribes; and as these consti-\ntuted the principal strength of Purthi Narains government, and continue to form the main support of the present one, they possess considerable authority. Their chiefs are known by the name of thunguns, from whom are selected the leading conductors of affairs. Their numbers are 36, the title properly descending only to the heads of families, and these 36 are subdivided into three other gradations.\n\nThe Ghoorkhali reigning family pretend to derive their descent from the Rajpoot Princes of Odeypoor, in the same manner as the Sevajee family claimed a similar origin. For a considerable period they have existed in the mountainous country bordering on the River Gunduck, during which time they have gradually risen into power by successive encroachments on their neighbours. After the conquest of Nepaul by the Ghoorkhalies, in 1768, the seat of government was transferred to Catmandoo, and the city of Gorcal having since been much neglected, is greatly decayed. Near to the city of Gorcal there is said to be a very considerable mass of rock crystal. (Kirkpatrick, &c.)\n\nGOUR. (Gaur). \u2014 The ruins of Gour (the ancient name of the capital of Bengal, and also of the province) are situated in the district of Rajemal, a few miles south of the town of Maulda. The name of Gaur is apparently derived from Gur, which, both in the ancient and modern languages of India, signifies raw sugar; and from the sanscrit term for manufactured sugar (sara) are derived the Persian, Greek, Latin, and modern European names of the cane and its produce. In 1582 this place is described by Abul Fazel as follows:\n\n\"Jennetabad is a very ancient city, and was once the capital of Bengal. Formerly it was called Lucknowty, and sometimes Gour. The present name (Jennetabad) was given it by the late emperor (Humayoon). Here is a fine fort, to the east of which is a large lake, called Chutteah Putteah, in which are many islands.\"\n\nThe ruins of this town extend 15 miles along the old banks of the Ganges, and are from two to three miles in breadth. Several villages stand on part of its site; the remainder is either covered with thick forests\u2014the resort of tigers, and beasts of prey, or it has become arable land, the soil of which contains a great deal of brick dust. The principal ruins are a mosque lined with black marble, elaborately wrought, and two gates of the citadel, which are grand and lofty. The bricks, which are of a most solid texture, are carried away to Moorshedabad, Maulda, and other places, for the purposes of building. The situation of Gour is nearly central to the populous parts of Bengal and Bahar, and not far from the junction of the principal rivers which form the excellent inland navigation. Lying to the east of the Ganges, it was secured against sudden invasion from the only quarter where hostile operations might be apprehended.\n\nNo part of the site of ancient Gour is nearer to the present bank of the Ganges than four miles and a half, and some parts, which were originally washed by that river, are now 12 miles from it. A small stream that runs past it communicates with its west side, and is navigable during the rainy season. On the east side, and in some places within two miles, it has the Mahamuddy River, which is always navigable, and communicates with the Ganges.\n\nGaura, or, as it is commonly called Bengali, is the language spoken in the provinces, of which the ancient city of Gour was the capital. It still prevails in all the provinces of Bengal, excepting some frontier districts, but is spoken with the greatest purity in the eastern parts only. Although Gaura be the name of Bengal, yet the Brahmans, who bear that appellation, are not.\ninhabitants of Bengal, but of Hindostan Proper. They reside chiefly in the province of Delhi, while the Brahmins of Bengal are avowed colonists from Kanoge.\n\nWhen Mahommed Bukhtyar Khililge conquered Bengal, A.D. 1204, he established the then ancient city of Gour as the capital of his dominions. Rajah Lackmaniyah, the last Hindu sovereign, whom he expelled, held his court at Nuddea.\n\nIn 1535 the Emperor Hamayoon, when in pursuit of Shere Khan, the Patan (who afterwards expelled him from Hindostan), took Gour, then the capital of Bengal. Ferishta says, that the seat of government was afterwards removed to Taunda, or Taura, a few miles higher up, on account of the unhealthiness of the climate. (Colebrooke, Rennel, Colonel Colebrooke, Stewart, Abul Fazel, &c.)\n\nGow.\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, district of Bahar, 52 miles S.S.W. from Patna. Lat. 25\u00b0. 1'. N. Long. 84\u00b0. 45'. E.\n\nGRESEC.\u2014This was formerly the capital of an ancient kingdom in the Island of Java, but is now merely a small town, divided between the natives and the Chinese, who have here their own campong, temples, and priests. Lat. 7\u00b0. 9'. S. Long. 112\u00b0. 50'. E.\n\nThere is here a small fort built of stone, within which are barracks for the guard who have charge of it. There is one wide street inhabited by the Dutch European establishment, and contiguous are the Malay and Chinese campongs; also the grand square, in which are the palaces of the two ruling tomagons.\n\nAt this place there is neither river nor rivulet, water for drinking being brought from two springs half-a-league off, or from Sourabhaya. The natives frequently use brackish water, and such as they catch when it rains. Notwithstanding the want of so essential an article, and in spite of the marshes and stagnant pools which surround the Malay and Chinese campongs, the station of Gressec is reckoned healthy by the Dutch.\n\nFrom Sourabhaya to Gressec by sea is about five leagues distance, which may be performed in five hours against wind and tide. The coast of Java, from the mouth of the Sourabhaya River to Gressec, forms a large angle, with an island in the middle. A bank of mud and sand, which extends along the coast, and is almost visible, has rendered necessary a wooden mole built on piles opposite to the fort, 600 feet in length, to which the boats are fastened. At the foot of the hills on which Gressec stands is a house for the manufacture of saltpetre.\n\nThe administration of the country is carried on by a resident, who has under him some Malay companies, officered by natives, and commanded by a Dutch sergeant, with the title of military commandant; the natives are governed by two tomagons. The chief produce of the district attached to the town is rice. (Tombe, Stavorinus, Bligh, &c.)\n\nGUALIOR, (Gualiar).\u2014A strong fortress in the province of Agra, 80 miles travelling distance south from the city of Agra. Lat. 26\u00b0. 18'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 14'. E.\n\nThe hill on which this celebrated fortress stands is in length one mile and six-tenths, but its greatest breadth does not exceed 300 yards. The height at the north end, where it is greatest, 342 feet, and the sides so steep as to be nearly perpendicular. A stone parapet extends all round close to the brow of the hill, which is so precipitous, that it was judged perfectly secure from assault until Major Popham took it by escalade on the 3d August, 1780: the storming party was led by Captain Bruce, brother to the traveller. The town, which is placed along the east side of the hill, is large, well inhabited, and contains many good houses of stone, which is furnished in abundance by the neighbouring hills, forming an amphitheatre round\nthe town and fort, at the distance of from one to four miles. They are principally composed of schistus, which apparently contains a large portion of iron. Their surface is rugged, and nearly destitute of vegetation. To the eastward runs the small River Soonrica, which in the beginning of spring is nearly dry. At the distance of 700 yards from the northern extremity is a conical hill, having on the top a remarkable building, consisting of two stone pillars joined by an arch. Within the summit of the fort are large natural excavations, which contain a perpetual supply of excellent water.\n\nA considerable trade is carried on here in cloth from Chanderi, and in indigo. About 14 miles distant, on the road to Narwar, is a mine of iron at the village of Beerc.\n\nGwalior must, in all ages, have been a military post of great consequence, both from its central situation in Hindostan, and the peculiarity of its formation, which was, by the natives, generally esteemed impregnable. During the time of the Mogul government it was a state prison, where the obnoxious branches of the royal family were confined, and a large menagerie kept for their entertainment, consisting of lions, tigers, and other wild beasts. When possessed by Madajee Sindia, he appropriated it to the same use; and, on account of its security, made it a grand depot for artillery, ammunition, and military stores.\n\nRajahs of Gwalior are mentioned so early as A.D. 1008, and it was first taken by the Mahomedans in 1197, after a long siege. The Hindoos afterwards regained possession, as it was again subduced by Altumsh, the Patan sovereign of Delhi, in 1235. In A.D. 1519, Gwalior surrendered to the forces of Ibrahim Lodi, the Delhi emperor, after having been 100 years occupied by the Hindoos; and, subsequent to this period, it must have been acquired by the Emperor Humayoon; for, in A.D. 1543, it was delivered up by his governor to Shere Khan, the Afghan. Thus it appears to have belonged to many masters, notwithstanding its reputation for impregnability. In 1582 it was the chief town of a district, described by Abul Fazel as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Gualior, containing 12 mahals, measurement 1,146,465 begahs. Revenue 29,683,749 dams. Seyurghal 240,350 dams. This sircar furnishes 2490 cavalry, and 43,000 infantry.\"\n\nAfter the dismemberment of the Mogul empire, Gwalior came into the possession of the Rana of Gohud, from whom it was taken by the Maharattas. In 1780 it was taken by escalade by the British forces, as above related; but afterwards given up to the Rana of Gohud, who, failing in his engagements, was abandoned to the resentment of the Maharattas. Madajee Sindia invested the fort, and after a fruitless siege of many months, prevailed at last by corrupting part of the garrison. In 1804 Gwalior was ceded to the British by Rajah Umbajee Row, but never taken possession of, as by the final treaty of 1805 with Dowlet Row Sindia, the Bengal government abandoned all the territory to the south of the Chumbul, and it is now possessed by that chief.\n\nTravelling distance from Delhi, 197 miles; from Lucknow, 211; from Benares, 355; from Nagpoor, 480; from Calcutta, by Birbhoon, 805 miles. (Hunter, Maurice, Reuel, Hodges, Abul Fazel, &c.)\n\nGubi.\u2014A town, containing 400 houses, in the Rajah of Mysore's territories. Lat. 13\u00b0 7' N. Long. 77\u00b0 16' E.\n\nThe houses in their external appearance are mean, and the place extremely dirty; but many of the inhabitants are thriving, and the trade considerable. There is held one of the greatest weekly fairs in the country.\n\nGubi is said to have been founded 400 years ago by a family of poly-\ngars, who resided at Hossoohully, two miles from hence; and who trace their descent from Honapa Guada, the hereditary chief of the Nonu Woculigaru caste. This person lived about 700 years ago, and his family possessed a country which annually produced about 3000 pagodas. They were first brought under subjection by the Mysore Rajahs, who imposed a tribute of 500 pagodas. Hyder increased this to 2500, leaving them little better than renters. They were entirely dispossessed by Tippoo, and have returned to their original profession of cultivators, but in their own tribe they still retain their hereditary rank. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nGudarah.\u2014A district in the S.E quarter of the Gujrat province, situated about the 23rd degree of north latitude. It is a very hilly and woody country, mostly possessed by petty chiefs tributary to the Guicowar Maharattas. The principal towns are Gundarah, Barreah, and Luma-wara, and the chief river the Mahy.\n\nGugah.\u2014A town, containing 600 inhabitants, in the province of Sinde, district of Tatta. Lat. 21\u00b0. 45'. N. Long. 68\u00b0. 7'. E.\n\nThis is a place of very little trade, but sheep and fowls are to be procured here at a moderate price. The hill on which this town stands is bounded on the southward and westward by a dry nullah, on the bed of which is a large tank of fine water. The soil around Gugah is a stiff sandy clay, and near the town are a number of fine trees, the only large ones visible from hence to Corachic. The appearance of the country is also much superior to the parts adjacent to the sea coast. Part of the country between Gahrah and Gugah is so low, and so intersected by many branches of the Indus, that it must be flooded at particular seasons of the year, and during the freshes. (Marfield, Kinneir, &c.)\n\nGuignan Isle.\u2014A small island, one of the Philippines, about 18 miles in circumference, lying off the south-eastern extremity of the Island of Samar, being the most easterly of all the Philippines.\n\nGuicowar.\u2014See Brodrah.\n\nGujerat.\u2014A town in the Seik territories, in the province of Lahore, 60 miles N.N.W. from the city of Lahore, Lat. 32\u00b0. 35'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 25'. E.\n\nGUJRAT', (Gujara Rushtra).\n\nA large province in Hindostan, situated principally between the 21st and 24th degrees of north latitude. On the north it is bounded by the province of Ajmeer; on the south by the sea and the province of Aurungabad; to the east it has Malwah and Khandesh; and to the west a sandy desert, the province of Cutch, and the sea. In length it may be estimated at 320 miles, by 180 the average breadth. The south-western quarter of this province approaches the shape of a peninsula, formed by the Gulfs of Cutch and Cambay, the sea coast along the first being as yet but imperfectly known to Europeans. When the Institutes of Acheb was composed by Abul Fazel, in 1582, Gujrat extended southward to Damaun, where it touched on Baglana, as appears by the following delineation extracted from the Ayeen Acberry:\n\n\"The soubah of Gujrat is situated in the second climate. The length from Boorhanpoor to Juggeth (Dwaraca) is 320 coss, and the breadth from Jalore to the port of Damaun measures 260 coss; and also from Ider to the port of Cambayet it is 70 coss broad. On the east lies Khandesh; on the north Jalore and Ider; on the south are the ports of Damaun and Cambayet; and on the west Juggeth. In the southern parts of this soubah are many mountains. It is watered by the ocean, and the following rivers: the Sabermatty, the Bateruck, the Melhindry, the Ner-budda, the Tuptec, and the Sur-sooty.\"\n\"Javari and bajera are the principal grains cultivated here. The fields are enclosed with hedges of the jekoom tree, which is a strong defence against cattle, and makes the country almost impenetrable to an army. This soubah is famous for painters, carvers, and handicraftsmen, and there is a great traffic carried on in precious stones. Silver is brought from Rome (the Turkish empire) and Irak. At first Putten was the seat of government, then Chunpaneer, and now Ahmedabad.\n\n\"Gujrat contains nine districts, viz. 1. Ahmedabad; 2. Putten; 3. Nadowt; 4. Behrooch; 5. Behrooth; 6. Chunpaneer; 8. Kodehra; 9. Soret. These districts are subdivided into 198 pargannahs, of which 13 contain ports. This soubah has 67,375 cavalry, and 8900 infantry.\"\n\nA considerable portion of the Gujrat province, particularly towards the eastern frontier, is very hilly, and much covered with jungle, which is rather encouraged by the inhabitants on account of the security it affords against invaders. The western boundary, extending along the Bunass River, and from thence to the sea, is a level arid country in some parts, and in others a low salt swamp of a singular description, distinguished by the name of the Run. In some parts this immense morass has dried up, but on account of the saline nature of the soil and water, it remains sterile and unproductive. The interior of the Gujrat Peninsula is hilly, and being rather scantily supplied with water, not productive of grain, but exhibits everywhere abundance of coarse vegetation suitable to the soil. Within these swamps, jungles, and hills, are many tribes of professed thieves, who prey on each other; and, being all cavalry, extend their depredations to a considerable distance.\n\nThe ancient limits of Gujrat appear to have included the greater part of Khandesh and Malwah. The coasts of the Gujrat Peninsula are particularly adapted for piracy, as they abound in little creeks and inlets, which furnish shelter and concealment from cruisers, on account of the difficult navigation. The province is intersected by several noble rivers, such as the Nerbudda, Tuptee, Mahy, and Mehindry, but in many parts a great scarcity of water is experienced. In the sandy soil, north of the Mahy River, which soon absorbs the periodical rains, the wells are deeper than to the southward, being from 80 to 100 feet deep. In the adjacent province of Marwar they are still deeper, the inhabitants being obliged to dig down from two to 300 feet, before they reach sufficient water.\n\nThe country of Gujrat generally, notwithstanding its smoothness to the eye, is much intersected by ravines and ground broken up by the rains. Some of these ravines are of a considerable depth and extent, and during the rains suddenly assume the appearance and volume of rapid rains, not to be crossed without the assistance of rafts or boats. When this occurs the natives soon establish temporary ferries, when passengers are not required to pay until they have landed, and mendicants and religious devotees of every description are wholly exempted. During the hot and dry months the surface of the country mostly appears sand, or dust, and in the rainy season a thick mire.\n\nThe Bheels, and poor inhabitants of the jungles in Gujrat, use the gum which exudes from the trunk and branches of the banbul tree for food. These trees are very common throughout the wastes in the north-west quarter of India, and grow spontaneously on all unoccupied ground. It is also planted as a fence round the villages, and the farmyards are protected by a thick hedge of it.\n\nIn so vast a province, never completely subdued by any invader, a great diversity of population may be expected, and Gujrat accordingly ex-\nhibits a wonderful variety of strange sects and castes.\n\nIn some parts of the province the Grassias are a numerous class of landholders, and in others merely possess a sort of feudal authority over certain portions of land and villages. They are described as consisting of four castes, or families: 1. Coolees, and their branches; 2. Rajpoots; 3. Scid Mahomedans; 4. Mole Islams, or modern Mahomedans. The residences of the most common Grassias are Rajpepla south, and Mandwee north, of the Nerbudda; Meagam and Ahnode between that stream and the Mahy, and Mandowee on the Tuptee. On the rugged margins of all rivers in Gujrat many Grassias reside in a kind of independence, and also all over the Gujrat Peninsula, which is usually denominated by the natives Cattivad, and by Europeans Cottwar. Criminals from the plains fly to their haunts for refuge, and receive the names of Grassias, Catties, Coolees, Bheels, and Mewassies; but are in reality all thieves, and supposed to amount to a half of the population north of the Mahy.\n\nOf all the plunderers who infest Gujrat the most bloody and untameable are the Coolees, who however present different characters in different districts; the most barbarous being found in the vicinity of the Run, or in the neighbourhood of the Mahy River. These are taught to despise every approach to civilization, and the appellation they bestow on a man decently dressed is that of pimp to a brothel. In order to procure respect they stain their apparel with charcoal pounded and mixed with oil, and their charons (priests and bards) and other influential persons, excel the laity in filthiness. With this caste cleanliness is indicative of cowardice. These customs are said to have originated with the Naroda, or degraded Rajpoots, who form a considerable portion of the population. However rich, a Naroda never dresses better than the lowest of his caste. The Portuguese at an early period used the name of Coolec as a term of reproach, and from them it descended to the English.\n\nThe description of men named Bhats, or Bharotts, abound more in Gujrat than in any of the other provinces of India. Some of them cultivate the land, but the greater number are recorders of births and deaths, and beggars or itinerant bards, in which last capacity they are also frequently traders. Some of this caste stand security for the public revenue, and guarantee the observance of agreements and awards. They are a singularly obstinate race, and when pressed for money, for which they have become security, sometimes sacrifice their own lives; but more frequently put to death some aged female, or a child of their family, in the presence of the person who caused them to break their word. These Bhatts are rewarded by a small percentage on the amount of the revenues for which they become security, and for the consequent protection it affords against the importunities of the inferior agents of government, their persons being regarded as sacred, and their influence very great over the superstitious minds of the natives.\n\nThe Charons in Gujrat are a sect of Hindoos, allied in manners and customs with the Bhatts. They are often possessed of large droves of carriage cattle, by means of which they carry on a distant inland traffic in grain and other articles. Travelers in the wildest parts of Gujrat are protected by Brahmans and Charons hired for the purpose. When a band of predatory horse appears, these sacred persons take an oath to die by their own hands in case their protege is pillaged; and in such veneration are they held by these superstitious thieves, that in almost every case this threat is found effectually to restrain them. Many subjects of the native princes in this province require the security of a private in-\nindividual, for the good faith of their own sovereign.\n\nIn this province, and in other parts of Hindostan Proper, there are a race of people named Ungreas, whose profession is that of money carriers, which is done by concealing it in their quitted cloths. Although miserably poor, one of them may be trusted with the value of 1000 rupees to carry many miles off, merely on the responsibility of his mirdha, or superior, who frequently is not richer than the other. They are of all castes, and in general well armed and athletic. When performing distant journeys they arrange themselves into parties, and fight with desperation to defend a property, for which their recompense is a mere subsistence. There is another sect in the northern and western parts of Gujrat, named the Puggies, from their extraordinary expertness in tracing a thief by his steps. When necessary this must be resorted to early in the morning, before the people have been moving about; in which event, such is their dexterity, that they seldom fail in pointing out the village where the thief has taken refuge.\n\nThe Dheras of Gujrat are a caste similar to the Mhar of the Deccan, and the Pariars of Malabar. Their employment is to carry fifth of every description out of the roads and villages, and from their immediate vicinity. They scrape bare the bones of every animal that dies within their limits, and share out the flesh, which they cook in various ways, and feed upon: the hide they sell to the caste of Maugs for one, two, or three rupees, according to the animal it belonged to. They are also obliged by ancient custom to serve the state and travellers as carriers of baggage to the nearest village from their own. They are guilty of numberless petty thefts, and much addicted to intoxication, when they can procure the requisites. At Jumbosser, in January, 1806, a Dhera was blown from a gun for poisoning a number of bullocks, and other cattle, for the sake of their skins. This caste is more employed by the British than is agreeable to the purer classes of Hindoos, who are contaminated by their vicinity. The goo-roos, or priests of the Dheras, are named garoodas, who cook and devour carrion like the rest of the tribe. Their more appropriate duties are the solemnizing of marriages and funeral obsequies among their own caste. On account of their extreme degradation, they dare not read the Vedas, nor learn sanscrit. They have abridgments of the mythological stories in the Puranas, written in the vernacular idiom on rolls of paper, ornamented with rude figures of the heroes of the Rama-yuna; by the exhibition of which, and the muttering of some charm, they pretend to cure diseases. In the Gujrat villages it is the custom to make the Dheras, Halalkhores, Bhungeas, who eat carrion, and Bheel, who kill innocent animals, to live by themselves in huts apart from the rest of the inhabitants. The washermen are also considered so cruel, on account of the numerous deaths they involuntarily occasion to the animals in the process of washing, that they are likewise classified among the seven degraded or excluded professions.\n\nIn this province the term Koonbee is given to the pure Sudra, or fourth caste, whatever his occupation be; but who, in Gujrat, are generally cultivators. In the Deccan this title distinguishes the cultivator from one who wears arms, and prefers being called a Maharatta. They mostly observe the Brahminical form of worship, but the Gujratee Koonbees in their diet abstain from all flesh and fish; whereas the Maharattas eat freely of mutton, poultry, fish, game, and every animal fit for food, excepting the cow species. A Gujratee Koonbee will not willingly kill any animal\u2014not even the most venomous snake. According to a tradition, the ancestors of the Koonbees,\nwho are now the most numerous and industrious part of the agricultural peasantry, were emigrants from Ajmeer and Hindostan Proper. They hold portions of government land, and are called Patells, in contradistinction to the Grasias. There are in this province three tribes of Koonbees, named Lewa, Kudwa, and Arjanna.\n\nThe different nyat or families of Brahmans established in Gujrat are 84, called after the places of their ancestor's nativity, or inheritance. Each of these has several subdivisions, the members of which, although on an equality, are not permitted to intermarry, the distinctions being almost innumerable.\n\nThe Vanceya are a numerous tribe of Hindoos in Gujrat, named Banjans by the English, and are separated into many subdivisions, besides the Awueks, or seceders from the Brahminical doctrines. They are all of them merchants and traffickers, and many of them travel to parts very remote from India, where they remain from one to 10 years, after which they return to their wives and children. Many also finally settle in the towns of foreign countries, where their descendants continue to speak and write the Gujrate tongue, which may be pronounced the grand mercantile language of Indian marts. The Gurjura language is very nearly allied to the Hindi tongue, while the character in which it is written conforms almost exactly to the vulgar Nagari.\n\nThe sect of Jains are more in number here than in any of the contiguous provinces, and possess many handsome temples, adorned with well-wrought images of marble, spars, and various metals. Their chief deity of the twenty-four, which they have altogether, is worshipped, as in other parts of India, under the name of Parswanatha. Among the Brahminical persuasion the adherents of Siva or Mahadera mark their foreheads horizontally, and those of Vishnu perpendicularly, which should be renewed every morning, and, if attainable, by a Brahmin. Many of the natives of Gujrat, especially of the Rajpoot tribes, when driven to any case of desperation, dress in yellow clothes, which is a signal of despair, and being reduced to the last extremity. The females of this province are frequently known to burn themselves with husbands with whom they have never cohabited, and with those who have ill treated them, as well as the reverse; a mistaken sense of what they conceive to be their duty actuating them, independent of affection. Diseases and ailments, which cannot easily be accounted for, are attributed to the malignant influence of witches' glances; hence in the Coolee and Rajpoot communities are seen many women without their noses\u2014this mutilation being supposed effectual in destroying the power.\n\nBesides its native hordes and castes Gujrat contains nearly all the Parsees, or fire-worshippers, to be found on the continent of India; the feeble remnants of the once predominant religion of the Magi. According to the accounts which the learned of the modern Parsees give of their own origin, it appears that, after the Mahommedan religion was promulgated in Arabia, and began to pervade Persia, the ancestors of the Indo Parsees retired to the mountains, where they continued until the overthrow of the Persian monarchy, and the death of Yezdijird, the last sovereign. Finding the religion of their native country wholly overthrown, and themselves outlaws, they wandered towards the Port of Ormus, then governed by a branch of the old royal family, where they resided 15 years, and where they acquired the art of ship-building, for which they are still justly celebrated, and also some practical knowledge of navigation.\n\nAt the expiration of the above period they quitted Ormus, and proceeded to the Island of Diu, where they sojourned 19 years; when, find-\ning it too small for their increasing numbers, they embarked for Gujrat, where they anchored at a town named Seyjan, then governed by Jadu Rana, and near to a point of land still named St. John by European mariners. After some negotiation with this prince they were allowed to land, on condition that they disarmed and assumed the Hindu dress, forms of marriage, and language.\n\nIn this hospitable land they first lighted up the atish beharam, or sacred fire, and remained stationary for several hundred years; but afterwards many migrated from Oodwada, the site of the holy flame, and, with their families, settled at Newsaree, Veriou, Oclaseer, Broach, and Cambay. Their subsequent establishment at Surat and Bombay, and rapid increase of numbers, belong to a more recent era.\n\nAfter their voluntary dispersion from the Seyjan territories, Mahmood Begra, Sultan of Ahmedabad, a usurper and religious bigot, about A.D. 1450, detached an army of 30,000 men to levy tribute from the Seyjan chief. The latter requested assistance from the Parsees, who joined him to the number of 1400, and a bloody battle was fought, in which the Mahommadans were worsted; but, returning with reinforcements, the Seyjan Rajah was compelled to pay tribute, and acknowledge the paramount authority of the Ahmedabad Sultan. Since this period the Parsees have resided, in larger or smaller communities, along the west coast of India; a few men of the tribe undertaking voyages to different parts of India, and latterly to Europe, in ships commanded by Europeans. The females have never quitted their homes, sanctified places, and sacred fires.\n\nThe modern Parsees are divided into two grand classes; the mobid or clerical, and the behdeen or laity. Mobids may marry a behdeen female; but behdeens cannot take wives from mobid families. The Parsees often train up other people's children of both sexes, and admit them to the privileges of the behdeen tribe; and the illegitimate offspring of Parsee men by native women are also admitted into their caste. Nor do they reject proselytes, even when grown up, if their characters be such as to inspire a confidence that they will scrupulously observe the laws of Zoroaster. The latter adoptions are rare; but the former are not unfrequent, and account for the different shades of complexion. The Parsee females have long preserved an unspotted character for chastity and superior continence, which may be accounted for from their being placed by their religious tenets (6th article) on an equality with the men.\n\nWhen a betrothed girl dies, the guardians of the boy who has thus lost his bride must look out for a girl who, in a similar manner, has been deprived of her intended husband; and, among adults, widowers ought only to wed with widows. A widow under forty is at liberty to marry again. Like the Hindoos, the Parsee betroth their children between the ages of four and nine years; the solemnization of the marriage takes place when convenient to the parties, but within the ninth year of the girl's age.\n\nAfter death a dog is procured to watch the corpse for some time, the Parsees believing most firmly in aerial evil beings visible to the canine species, and esteem those dogs the quickest of perception that have light brown eye-brows. From this quality, which they suppose inherent, they account for the dismal howl of dogs at night, which they affirm drives the hovering devils from their house tops; and they say the dogs exert a less frightful effort when their barking is merely directed against thieves. The Parsees have an extreme aversion to touch a dead hare, but not a living one; and this dislike extends to all other\ndead animals, although not so vehemently.\n\nThe Parsees do not keep registers of their own numbers, which, from their peaceable and industrious habits, must be rapidly on the increase. Their principal places of abode are Diu, Cambay, Broach, Oclaseer, Hansoot, Veriou, Surat, Nowsarree, Oodwar, Damaun, and Bombay. On the death of a behdeen, the number of adult mobid (clerical) males in the settlement may be known, as they all make their appearance, and receive a shirt or other piece of apparel from the heir, who is also under the necessity of giving them a feast. From these entertainments it is inferred, that there are in Surat 1600 mobids arrived at man's age; the behdeens are supposed to exceed 12,000. By a census taken at Broach, in 1807, it was found there were 3101 souls, old and young, dark and fair, of mobid and behdeen Parsees, in that town and its suburbs.\n\nMany of the mobids, or sacerdotal class, can read and write what they call the Zeud or Pehlavi character sufficiently to answer the purposes of their religious ceremonies; but their knowledge seldom penetrates deeper; nor are the Parsees generally addicted to literature of any kind, their exertions being directed to the pursuits of commerce.\n\nThe province of Gujrat enjoyed a much more flourishing commerce, even during the most violent convulsions of the Mogul government, than it has ever done since. The chief exports are cotton, piece goods, and grain, and the principal trade with Bombay. The imports consist mostly of sugar, raw silk, pepper, cocoa nuts, cochineal, woollens, and it absorbs a great deal of bullion. The Surat manufactures have long been famous for their cheapness and excellent quality. Almost all castes in this province (Brahmins and Banjans excepted) follow the occupation of the loom occasionally, which employs a great number of the more industrious of the lower classes.\n\nIn all the larger towns are to be found that remarkable race of men, named the Boras, who, though Mahomedans in religion, are Jews in features, manners, and genius. They form everywhere a distinct community, and are everywhere noted for their address in bargaining, minute thrift, and constant attention to lucre; but they profess total uncertainty of their own origin. Boorhanpoor, in Khandesh, is the headquarters of this singular sect, and the residence of their moullah, or high priest; but the individuals are found straggling all over Gujrat and the adjacent provinces as itinerant pedlars.\n\nIt is a custom in the Gujrat province, when a merchant finds himself failing or actually failed, to set up a blazing lamp in his shop, house, or office, and then abscond until his creditors have examined his effects, and received a disclosure of his property. Until his creditors have acquitted him he does not wear the tail of his waist-cloth hanging down as is usual, but tucks it up. Persons who act thus in time, so as not much to injure their creditors, are greatly esteemed, and have so frequently been remarked as subsequently prosperous, that Hindoo merchants have been known to set up a light (become bankrupt) without any necessity, in hopes of good fortune afterwards.\n\nThe principal towns in this province are Surat, Ahmedabad, Broach, Cambay, Gogo, and Champaner. It is difficult to estimate the number of the inhabitants of a country where the extremes of population and desolation are to be found. Surat and its vicinity exemplify the first, and the north-western districts the second. For the sake of security the great body of the natives in Gujrat do not live in single sequestered houses, but in assemblages of them; in Maabar, on the contrary, every Hindoo has a distinct or distant dwelling. Fortifications were formerly very numerous in Gujrat, and\nstill continue so in the more savage and remote quarters; but wherever the British influence extends, they are fast crumbling to decay. A few years ago female infanticide prevailed among the tribe of Jharcjah, of which are the principal chieftains of the Gujrat Peninsula; such as Jam of Noanuggur, the Rajahs of Wadman, of Gondel, and many others. All these leaders, through the exertions of the late Governor of Bombay, Jonathan Duncan, Esq., and of Colonel Walker, in 1807, were induced to enter into voluntary engagements, renouncing the inhuman practice, which was perpetrated by drowning the infant in milk as soon as born. The whole number of inhabitants in this vast province probably does not exceed six millions, in the proportion of about one Mahomedan to 10 Hindoos.\n\nThere are many remarkable wells and watering places in Gujrat, particularly one near Baroda, which is said to have cost nine lacks of rupees; and another at Vadwa, in the vicinity of Cambay, which, from the inscription, appears to have been erected in 1482. Smoking tobacco is a very universal practice among all Hindoo males, (Brahmins excepted, who take snuff freely) and Mahomedans of both sexes throughout Gujrat. A beegah of land planted with tobacco, near Broach, yields a net revenue to the government of 20 rupees on an average. This province has long been famous for its excellent breed of cattle, especially the bullocks, which are reckoned the strongest, swiftest, and handsomest in India.\n\nIt is a common belief in Gujrat, that the province was originally peopled by the rude castes which still exist, and are known by the names of Coocees and Bheels; but there is neither record nor tradition regarding the nature of their religion or government while subsisting in this primeval state. In the town of Rajpepla the Rajpoot successor is still formally invested by a family of Bheels, called Koobhal or Kootel, descended from their original chieftains. Subsequently to this period the Rajpoots acquired the ascendancy; and the most powerful chief of that race resided at Anhulvada, (named Nehrwalla and Puttun in the maps) situated on the northern frontiers. Three dynasties are said successively to have occupied this throne, named Chowra, Soolumker, and Vaghela, from which, as may be expected, many of the modern Grassia families claim descent.\n\nWe learn from Abul Fazel, that Gujrat was first invaded by Mahmood of Ghizni about A.D. 1095, who subverted the throne of its native prince, named Jamund, and plundered Nehrwallah, his capital. After the establishment of the Delhi sovereignty, this province remained for many years subordinate to the Patan emperors; but in the 15th century became again independent, under a dynasty of Rajpoot princes, converted to the Mahomedan religion, who removed the seat of government to Ahmedabad, and influenced many of the natives to embrace their newly-adopted faith. In 1572, in the reign of the Emperor Acher, this race of princes was overthrown, and the province subjugated; but during the period of its independence it had greatly flourished as a maritime and commercial state; and when the Portuguese first visited Malacca they found a regular intercourse established between Gujrat and that port.\n\nAfter the death of Aurengzebe, in 1807, this province was at an early period overrun by hordes of Mahratta depredators; and about 1724 was finally severed from the Mogul throne, which never afterwards recovered its authority. At present the more civilized and cultivated parts are possessed by the British, the Guicowar, and the Peshwa. The British territories occupy a considerable tract of country on both sides of the Gulf of Cambay, and include the populous cities of Surat,\nBroach, Cambay, and Gogo. Several of the Peshwa's districts are intermingled with those of the British, and approach within a few miles of Surat; these he was permitted to retain as a particular favour at the treaty of Basscin. The sea coast, from the Gulf of Cambay to the River Indus, is occupied by different independent native chiefs, all greatly addicted to piracy; but now, against their inclinations, much coerced by the superiority of the British naval power.\n\nThe northern and western quarters, and the centre of the Gujrat Peninsula, have only recently been explored, and exhibit a state of society, which probably at a remote period existed all over Hindostan. The number of societies of armed and sanguinary thieves, by birth and profession, in this region is scarcely credible, and excites a surprise, that thinly as the inhabitants are scattered over the wilder parts, any population at all should remain. Within the districts acquired by the Company all barbarous practices have been abolished, or are gradually disappearing; but in the north-western quarters they prevail in their utmost perfection of cruelty and cunning.

The chief towns are Darwar and Gunduck.\n\nGunduck.\u2014A town in the province of Bejapoor, district of Gunduck, 47 miles E. from Darwar. Lat. 15\u00b0 27'. N. Long. 75\u00b0 42'. E.\n\nGunduck River, (Gandaki, or Salgrami).\u2014The source of this river is said to be situated to the northward of Mooktinath, in the direction of Moostang, and not far from Kaybeeni. Moostang is a place of some note in Upper Tibet, or Bhoot, and 12 days journey from Beeni Sheher. The breadth of this river at the latter place is said not to exceed 30 yards. Four days journey north of Beeni Sheher is Mooktinath, with-\nin half a mile of which the Gunduck takes the name of Salgrami, the consecrated pebbles so called abounding particularly in that part of its bed. Three days journey beyond Mooktinath is a celebrated spring, or natural reservoir, called Durnmodher koond.\n\nThe salgrams are black stones found in a part of the Gunduck River, within the limits of the Nepaul dominions. They are mostly round, and commonly perforated in one or more places by worms, or, as the Hindoos believe, by Vishnu, in the shape of a reptile. According to the number of perforations, and of spiral curves in each, the stone is supposed to contain Vishnu in various characters. The salgram is found upon trial not to be calcareous; it strikes fire with steel, and scarcely at all effervesces with acids. A few grains of gold are occasionally separated from the sand of the Gunduck, and also from the Salgrams. In Northern Hindostan the term Gunduck is a general appellation for a river; and Major Rennel conjectures it to be the Condochates of Arrian. The stricter classes of Hindoos abstain from swimming in this river, it being forbidden in their sacred books. (Kirkepatrick, Colebrooke, Rennel, Wilford, &c.)\n\nGundgole, (Gandhagola). \u2014 A town in the Northern Circars, in the district of Ellore, 48 miles N. by E. from Masulipatam. Lat. 16\u00b0. 49'. N. Long. 16\u00b0. 20'. E.\n\nGungapatam.\u2014A town in the Carnatic, 108 miles N. from Madras. Lat. 14\u00b0. 27'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 13'. E.\n\nGUNDWANA.\n\nA large province in the Deccan, extending from the 19th to the 25th degree of north latitude. On the north it is bounded by Allahabad and Bahar; on the south by Orissa and the Godavery; to the east it has Orissa, Bengal, and Bahar; and to the west Malwah, Berar, and Allahabad. In length it may be estimated at 400 miles, by 280 miles the average breadth.\n\nGundwana in its most extensive sense comprehends all that part of India surrounded by the soubahs abovementioned, which remained unconquered by the Mahommedans up to the reign of Aurengzebe; but Gundwana Proper, or the country of the Goonds, is more strictly limited to the districts of Gurrah Mundlah, Choteesgur, Nagpoor, and Chandah, reaching south beyond Bustar and Dewlumurry. The modern names of the districts into which this ancient province has been subdivided are, Boghela, Chandail, Billounjah, Singrowly, Sohagepoor, Gurrah Mundlah, the Nagpoor territories east of the Wurda River, Sirgoojah, Jushpoor, Choteesghur, or Ruttanpoor, Gangpoor, Sumbhlupoor, Chandah, and a considerable territory to the south between the Godavery and the province of Orissa. The principal towns are Nagpoor, Gurrah, Rutunpoor, Ryepoor, Sumbhlupoor, and Bustar.\n\nDuring the reign of Aurengzebe the northern part of this province, named Baundhoo, or Bhatta, was partially conquered by his generals, and annexed to the soubah of Allahabad; but they never made any impression on the southern quarter, which remained unsubdued until about the middle of the 18th century, when Ragojee Bhoonslah of Nagpoor, reduced or rendered tributary the greatest portion of it, and confined the independent Goonds within very narrow limits. By the Mahommedans the large district of Choteesghur is sometimes named Je-hareund, but this appellation properly applies to the greater part of the Gundwana province.\n\nA large proportion of this province is mountainous, poor, ill watered, unhealthy, covered with jungle, and thinly inhabited, to which evil qualities may be attributed its long independence. The more fertile tracts are subject to the Nagpoor Maha-\nrattas, and some of them, particularly Choteesgur and Nagpoor, are remarkably productive; but the country occupied by the native Goonds is exactly the reverse, being one continued wilderness. This miserable tribe continue nearly in a state of nature, and are probably the lowest in the scale of all the natives of India. Having been driven by their invaders from the plains to the unwholesome fastnesses of the more elevated regions, they frequently descend during the harvest to the low lands, and plunder the produce of their ancient inheritance. During the course of the last 30 years, the desire of the wild Goonds for salt and sugar has considerably increased, and has tended more to their civilization than any other means. The sea air is said to be as fatal to their temperament as that of the hills to the inhabitants of the adjacent plains. The Goonds are Hindoos of the Brahminical sect, but appear to have many peculiarities, as they eat fowls, and do not abstain from flesh in general, except that of the ox, cow, and bull. One of their chiefs, who resided at Deogur, 40 miles N. E. from Pandooma, was conquered by a general of Aurangzebe's, and carried prisoner to Delhi, where he had his country returned to him on embracing the Mahomedan faith, and also the title of Boorahan Shah. His descendants were subdued by the Bhoonslab Maharattas, and carried prisoners to Nagpoor; yet though they still continue Mahommedans, the other Goond chiefs esteem it an honour to be connected by marriage with the family. Besides these chiefs, Aurangzebe made a forcible conversion of many others of the lower classes of natives. The present Goond tribes are nearly all tributary to the Maharattas, but their contributions generally require a body of troops to enforce the payment. When not occupied in this manner, they are engaged in hostilities with each other. Nagpoor is the present capital of Gundwana; the ancient capitals were Gurrah, Mundlah, and Deogur, but there are no vestiges indicative that the province at any period flourished as a civilized or cultivated country. (J. Grant, Lec-kie, Blunt, &c.)\n\nGuntoor.\u2014A district in the Northern Circars, situated principally between the 16th and 17th degrees of north latitude. This is the most southerly of the Northern Circars, and comprehends an area of about 2500 square miles, exclusive of the mountainous tract on the west. The River Krishna forms the northern boundary of this district, and separates it from Condapilly. There are diamond mines in this Circar, which have not of late been productive. The principal towns are Guntoor, Condavir, Bellumcondah, and Nizampatam.\n\nIn 1765, when Lord Clive obtained the Northern Circars from the Mogul, this Circar remained in the possession of Bazalet Jung, the Nizam's brother, to be enjoyed by him as a jaghire during his life; after which it was to devolve to the Company. In 1779 a treaty was most improperly concluded with Bazalet Jung by the Madras government, without the consent of the Nizam, for the cession of Guntoor; and in a few months afterwards it was granted by the same government to Mahomed Ali, the Nabob of the Carnatic; on a lease of 10 years; but the whole transaction was annulled the following year by the Bengal government. Bazalet Jung died in 1782; but the country was not taken possession of by the Company until 1788, they continuing to pay a tribute of seven lacks of rupees to the Nizam.\n\nIn 1801 the Bengal revenue and judicial system were carried into effect; but the Guntoor Circar having come later under the British dominion than the other four districts, it was assessed with a reference to the average collections, during the period of 13 years it had been subject to the Company's authority.\n\nIn 1803, when Seemunder Jah suc-\nceeded his father on the throne of Hyderabad, he offered to relinquish the tribute paid by the British government on account of this Circar; but the offer was refused by the Marquis Wellesley, then governor-general.\n\nWith the addition of Palnaud, the Guntoor territory now forms one of the districts under the Madras presidency, into which the Northern Circars were divided on the establishment of the Bengal revenue and judicial system. (Reynell, 5th Report, &c.)\n\nGuntoor.\u2014A town in the Northern Circars, the capital of a district of the same name. Lat. 16\u00b0 12'. N. Long. 80\u00b0 20'.

E.\n\nGurrah, (Ghara).\u2014A large district in the province of Malwah, situated about the 23d degree of north latitude. In the remote times of Hindoo antiquity this was the seat of a considerable Hindoo principality, which comprehended Bhatta, Sohagepoor, Choteesghur, Sumblupoor, Gungpoor, Jushpoor, and other contiguous districts. In the reign of Aurengzebe the division of Bhatta, or Bandhoo, consisting of the six districts above-mentioned, was considered as a new conquest, although it had before been partially subjected, and was formally annexed to the Soubah of Allahabad. It has been estimated to contain 25,000 square miles of high, mountainous, unproductive territory. The principal towns are Gurrah, Panagur, and Mundlah; and the Nerbuddah, which has its source on the eastern frontier towards Gundwanah, is the chief river. Many parts of this district are remarkably fertile, but it is thinly populated, and little cultivated.\n\nGurrah.\u2014A town in the province of Malwah, district of Gurrah Mundlah, 140 miles N. by E. from Nagpoor. Lat. 23\u00b0 10'. N. Long. 80\u00b0 15'. E. Formerly there was a mint here, in which an inferior rupee, current in Bundelcund, named Ballashahi, was coined. (Leckie, &c.)\n\nGurrumcondah.\u2014A district in the Balaghaut ceded territory, situated between the 13th and 14th degrees of north latitude; of a very mountainous surface, and abounding in strong positions. The greater part is now comprehended in the collectorship of Cudapah.\n\nGurrumcondah.\u2014A strong hill-fort and town, the capital of a district of the same name, 125 miles W. N. W. from Madras. Lat. 13\u00b0 45'. N. Long. 78\u00b0 40'. E.\n\nThis is a strong hill-fort, and was besieged in 1791 by the Nizam's army, assisted by a small British detachment, which stormed the lower part without much loss, and was afterwards ordered south to join the grand army. A body of troops was left to garrison the lower fort, and blockade the upper, under the command of one of the Nizam's generals, who was soon afterwards attacked by Hyder Saheb, Tippoo's eldest son, totally routed, and slain. After supplying the upper fort with necessaries, Hyder Saheb retreated, having accomplished the object for which he had been detached. (MSS. &c. &c.)\n\nGurudwara, (the Gate of the Instructor).\u2014An extensive village in Northern Hindostan, in the province of Serinagur. Lat. 30\u00b0 22'. N. Long. 78\u00b0 10'. E.\n\nHere is a handsome temple, erected by Ram Ray, one of the followers of Nanoc Shah, the founder of the Seiks, the priests of which are of the Udasi sect. At the vernal equinox an annual fair is held at this place, numerously attended by pilgrims from Lahore and the westward countries.\n\nAbout half a mile to the north of this village is the field of battle, which decided the contest between the Serinagur and Goorkhali Rajahs, the former of whom was killed by a musket ball, and his country ren-\ndered tributary to Nepaul. A little to the north of Gurudwara is the pergunnah of Dhoom, situated betwixt the Junma and the Ganges, which are here about 40 miles distant. The district is remarkably fertile, but much oppressed by the heavy exactions of the Nepalese government, the revenue being reduced from one lack to 35,000 rupees. (Kaper, &c.)\n\nGuptpurba River, (Gatapurva).\u2014A small river, which has its source in the Western Ghauts; and, after a short course, falls into the River Krishna, near the village of Almody. Lat. 16\u00b0 37'. N. Long. 76\u00b0 5'. E.\n\nGuznoogur, (Gajanagur, an Elephant Town).\u2014An Afghan district in the province of Kabul, situated between the 34th and 35th degrees of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by Kuttore, or Calistan; and to the west by the Chuganserai River; but very little is known respecting the interior, as it has been but little explored.\n\nH.\n\nHadjee Omar Kalaudy.\u2014A place of refreshment in the province of Sinde, district of Tatta, 15 miles E. of Corachie, on the road to Tatta. About a mile to the S. W. of this place the soil is a fine loam, and overflowed during the freshes in the Indus. To the north there is a fine well, about 130 feet deep, with steps to go down. From hence to the Pelle Choultry, distant eight miles, the road is bad, broken ground, with a loose sandy soil.\n\nHainam Isle.\u2014A large island in the China Sea, situated at the southern extremity of that empire, between the 18th and 20th degrees of north latitude. In length it may be estimated at 190 miles, by 70 the average breadth. Although placed so near the tract of ships bound to Canton, very few particulars respecting this island are known. In 1805, according to Captain Krosenstern, the Ladrones pirates, who infest the southern coast of China, had obtained possession of this island.\n\nHajagunge, (Hajiganj).\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Dacca Jelalpoor, 29 miles S. W. from Dacca. Lat. 23\u00b0 31'. N. Long. 89\u00b0 53'. E.\n\nHajykan, (Hajican).\u2014A large district within the Afghan territories to the west of the Indus, and situated between the 29th and 31st degrees of north latitude. It consists principally of a stripe of land bounded by the Indus on the east, and a ridge of mountains to the west, and is inhabited chiefly by migratory tribes of Afghans and Balooches, who occasionally pay tribute to the Kabul sovereigns. There are also a few small towns and villages, in which some Hindoo merchants are settled, and carry on the trifling commerce which the state of the country permits; but the great majority of the inhabitants are Mahomedans of the Sooni sect. The limits of this district are undefined, and it has as yet been but imperfectly explored.\n\nHajypoor.\u2014A district in the province of Bahar, situated principally between the 25th and 26th degrees of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by Bettiah; on the south by the Ganges; on the east by Tyrhoot; and on the west by Sarun. In 1784, in all its dimensions, this district contained 2782 square miles. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as containing \"11 mahals; measurement, 436,952 beegahs; revenue, 27,331,030 dams.\"\n\nThis is a very fertile, well-cultivated district, and is peculiarly productive of saltpetre, the greater part for the Company's investment being manufactured in this country and in the adjacent territory of Sarun. The principal towns are Hajypoor, Singhea, and Mowah. At Hajypoor, or Hurryhur Chitter, an annual fair of horses is held in the month of No-\nvember. The demand for horses of the breed of the Company's provinces appears rapidly to increase. In 1807 the whole number of horses produced at the fair amounted to nearly 6000, two of which, from the Company's stud, sold for 4000 rupees each. (J. Grant, 10th Register, Abul Fazel, &c.)\n\nHAJYPOOR.\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, district of Hajypoor, situated on the north-east side of the Ganges, at its confluence with the Gunduck, and nearly opposite to Patna. Lat. 25\u00b0. 41'. N. Long. 85\u00b0. 21'. E. This place is said to have been founded by Ilyas Khan, or Hajy Elias, the second independent Mahomedan King of Bengal, who died A.D. 1358.\n\nHAJYPUR.\u2014A small town in the Seik territories, in the province of Lahore, situated on the north side of the Beyah River, which is here 100 yards broad, 65 miles S. E. from Lahore. Lat. 31\u00b0. 26'. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 51'. E.\n\nHALDUBARY.\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Purneah, situated on the east side of the Mahanuddly River, near the Morung frontier, and 55 miles N. E. from Purneah. Lat. 26\u00b0. 20'. N. Long. 87\u00b0. 59'. E.\n\nHALLIAR.\u2014A small district in the province of Gujrat, extending along the eastern side of the Gulf of Cutch. It is possessed by independent native chiefs, who claim descent from Rawal, the youngest son of Rai Hummer, the sovereign of Cutch. This prince usurped the throne of his father, but was afterwards compelled to resign it to his brother, and leave the country. He crossed the Run at Mallia, and proceeded to Amran, which he seized, and finally established his head-quarters at a village named Nagne, where Noanagur now stands. He afterwards succeeded in getting off the Rannah of Poorbunder by treachery, and extended his frontier to the Run of Okamundel. His followers he exhorted to conquer what they could, and keep it, so effectually, that, in a few years, this race, named the Halla Rajpoots, had added 400 villages to their possessions, which received the name of Halliar, an appellation it still retains.\n\nThis district is not generally fertile, but there are particular spots in a high state of cultivation. Trees are seldom to be met with in Halliar, to remedy which the Jam of Noanagur ordered the heads of villages to plant a certain number of mango trees annually. The Halliars never shoe their horses, yet they gallop at full speed over the worst ground, their hoofs becoming as hard as the rocks on which they tread.\n\nThe natives in this part of the country have a practice of suspending rags on trees, and piling stones on each other by the road side. An itinerant devotee hangs a piece of his garment on a tree, which rag is seen by the travellers, who follow the example of the sage, and the tree becomes a consecrated peer or saint, and is stiled the Chintra Peer, or Ragged Saint. (M. Murdo, &c.)\n\nHANGWELLE.\u2014A town and fortress in the Island of Ceylon, 18 miles E. from Columbo. Lat. 7\u00b0. 1'. N. Long. 80\u00b0. 3'. E. In September, 1803, the king of Candy attacked this place with a numerous army, but was defeated with great slaughter by the garrison under Captain William Pollok, consisting of 50 Europeans, 160 sepoys, and 17 gun lascars.\n\nHANSOOT, (Hansanati).\u2014A town in the province of Gujrat, 12 miles S. W. from Broach. Lat. 21\u00b0. 32'. N. Long. 72\u00b0. 59'. E.\n\nHANSY, (Hansi).\u2014A town in the province of Delhi, district of Hissar Ferozeh, 60 miles W. from Delhi. Lat. 28\u00b0. 40'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 16'. E. It lies on the canal (now in ruins), formerly made from the Junna by Sultan Feroze, and is sometimes named Hansy Hissar, on account of its proximity to the latter town. Hansy stands upon a hill, and is supplied with water from wells.\nwithin the fort, for there is but little in the vicinity. It was captured by the Mahommedans of Ghizni so early as 1035, and, towards the end of the 18th century, was the capital of the short-lived principality erected by the adventurer George Thomas. It is now possessed by independent native chiefs. (G. Thomas, Rennel, &c.)\n\nHaribara.\u2014A town in the Balaghat ceded territories, 48 miles N.W. from Chitteldroog, situated on east side of the Toombuddra River. Lat. 14\u00b0. 24'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 48'. E.\n\nThis fort contains a temple and 100 houses occupied by Brahmins, and the suburbs contain above 100 houses of low castes. In this vicinity several of the poorer inhabitants never marry, the expense attending the ceremony being considered too great. Not many of the women, however, live in a state of celibacy, to which, in most parts of India, they are seldom subjected. Few of the men go to foreign countries, and the rich have always more wives than one. The inhabitants in the neighbourhood of Haribara (or Hurryhur) have the character of remarkable stupidity, which is even extended to the Brahmins, a defect by no means common to this sacred order of men. The cultivation here is that of the dry grains, and the exports cotton and cotton thread.\n\nAfter the defeat and death of Ram Rajah, and the destruction of Bijanagur, this place became subject to the Adil Shahee dynasty of Bejaipoor. On the conquest of the Deccan by the Moguls, it was taken by the Shahnoor, or Savanore Nabob, Delil Khan; and from the house of Timour it was taken by the Ikori Rajahs, who were expelled by the Maharattas; and these, after 15 years' possession, were driven out by Hyder. Since that time it has been taken by the Maharattas; the last time, in 1792, by Purseram Bhow. (P. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nHarlem Isle.\u2014A small island about four miles in circumference, lying off the N.W. coast of Ceylon. Lat. 9\u00b0. 41'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 54'. E. This island belongs to the district of Jaffnapatam, and affords excellent pasturage for horses.\n\nHarponully, (Harponhelly).\u2014A district in the south of India, bounded on the north by the Toombuddra River, and situated about the 15th degree of north latitude. This country is not so hilly as the adjacent districts, but there are some strong positions, the principal of which is Oochinadroog. The villages are frequent, and tolerably well populated.\n\nThe Rajah of Harponully continued nearly independent until 1774, when his territory was conquered by Hyder, and added to his dominions as a tributary appendage. In 1786 Tippoo completely subdued the province, and sent the rajah prisoner to Seringapatam. On the fall of Seringapatam, the heir took possession of Harponully, and is now a Jaghiredar under the Company. It is supposed he had no just claim to the estate, but that he was merely a boy set up by the Brahmins, who held the principal offices under former rajahs, merely to perpetuate the management of affairs in their own hands. In this manner rajahs and zemindars are created everywhere in the Company's dominions, because the chief native servants, in order to secure their own situations, which are generally hereditary, whenever the line is extinct, take care to bring forward a child from some quarter.\n\nThis district was ceded to the Company by the Nizam in 1800, and having since experienced a tranquillity unknown before, has greatly improved in population, revenue, and cultivation. It now forms part of the Bellary collectorship under the Madras presidency. (Moor, Moor, &c.)\n\nHarponully.\u2014A town in the south of India, the capital of a district of the same name, 170 miles N. by W. from Seringapatam. Lat. 14\u00b0. 47'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 18'. E.\nHarowty, (Haravati).\u2014A district in the province of Ajmeer, situated between the 25th and 26th degrees of north latitude. Near the village of Mackundra, Lat. 24\u00b0. 18'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 12'. E. is a ridge of mountains, which extends to the east and west, dividing the province of Malwah from the district of Harowty, or country of the tribe Hara. The chief towns are Kotah and Boondee, and the principal river the Chumbul, by which the district is intersected. The Chiefs of Boondee and Kotah are of the Chohan tribe, and are denominated Half Rajpoots. The cultivators are Rajpoots, Jauts, Brahmins, Bheels, and other castes. (Hunter, G. Thomas, &c.)\n\nHariopoor, (Udiarpur).\u2014A town possessed by independent zamindars, in the province of Orissa, 50 miles S. W. from Midnapoor. Lat. 21\u00b0. 52'. N. Long. 86\u00b0. 52'. E.\n\nHasser, (Aseeer, or Asootahma).\u2014A district in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Khandesh, situated between the 21st and 22d degrees of north latitude. The surface is hilly, and the country contains many positions naturally remarkably strong, on which the native chiefs have erected fortifications. The land is fertile, and tolerably well watered by the Tuptee and Poornah, which are the principal rivers; the most noted towns are Boorhanpoor, Hasser or Aseeer, and Chandah.\n\nHasser, (Aseeer).\u2014A town and fortress in the province of Khaudesh, 15 miles N. from Boorhanpoor. Lat. 21\u00b0. 32'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 21'. E.\n\nThis place was the capital of Khaudesh, when subdued by Aeer, Abul Fazel describes it as situated on a lofty mountain, and incomparably strong. Although by the natives deemed nearly impregnable, it surrendered without much resistance to the army under Colonel Stevenson, in October, 1803; and was restored to Sindia in December next, when peace was concluded by General Wellesley.\n\nHaslah, (Hasela, Receipt).\u2014A town in the Seik territories, in the province of Lahore, 154 miles N. W. from the city of Lahore. Lat. 33\u00b0. 26'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 32'. E.\n\nHastee, (Hasti, an Elephant).\u2014A town in the province of Aurun-gabad, belonging to the Nizam, 40 miles S. E. from Jahnapoor. Lat. 19\u00b0. 32'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 53'. E.\n\nHattia Isle.\u2014An island in the province of Bengal, formed by the mud deposited by the great Rivers Brahmapootra and Gauges, at their junction with the ocean in the Bay of Bengal. In length it may be estimated at 14 miles, by 10 the average breadth. The surface lies very low, and at spring tides, during the height of the rains, is nearly submerged. Salt of an excellent quality is manufactured here for the Company's account, which brings a high price at their periodical sales in Calcutta.\n\nHatras, (Hettras).\u2014A town in the province of Agra, 33 miles N. by E. from the city of Agra. Lat. 27\u00b0. 40'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. E. This is the chief mart for the cotton produced in the Agra province. From hence, it is conveyed by an easy land carriage of 100 miles to Furruckabad on the Ganges; and from that city by water to Mirzapoor, in the Behares province. (Colebrooke, &c.)\n\nHaurauca Isle.\u2014A small island in the Eastern Seas, about 25 miles in circumference. Lat. 3\u00b0. 40'. S. Long. 128\u00b0. 40'. E. It is one of the Amboyna Isles.\n\nHelai.\u2014A village near the Indus, in the province of Sind, situated in the road from Tatta to Hyderabad. Lat. 24\u00b0. 52'. N.\n\nAbout a mile to the west of this place are two remarkable hills, on which are several buildings. The land adjacent is cultivated, and has a fertile appearance. At this place the Indus is three-fourths of a mile wide, and has from four to five fathoms water.\nHENERY ISLE.\u2014A small island lying due south from Bombay. Lat. 18\u00b0. 42'. N. Long. 72\u00b0. 50'. E.\n\nThis island is about 600 yards in circumference, and nearly of a circular form. There is only one landing place in the north-east side, where boats can lie. The island is well inhabited, being covered with houses and fortified. In 1790 it belonged to Ragoojee Angria, and though in sight of Bombay, was a principal rendezvous for pirate vessels of considerable size.\n\nNear Henery is another small island named Kenery, which is also fortified and of considerable strength. In 1790 it belonged to the Peshwa, who also permitted pirates to resort to the harbour. Kenery was taken possession of and fortified by Sevajee, in October, 1679, before which time, from a supposed want of fresh water, it had been neglected. Henery was first settled and fortified by Siddee Cossim in 1680. (Moor, &c.)\n\nHERIURU.\u2014A town in the Mysore Rajah's territories, situated on the east-side of the River Vedawati. Lat. 13\u00b0. 46'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 37'. E.\n\nDuring the government of the Chit-teldroog Rajahs, this place contained 2000 houses, with an outer and inner fort. In the reign of Hyder the town suffered considerably from the Maharattas, and was afterwards plundered by Purseram Bhow. The ravages of this chief were followed by a dreadful famine, which swept away all the inhabitants. When the British forces arrived before Seringapatam, about 60 houses had again been occupied. Some of the grain dealers, that followed the camp, found their way to this distance, and plundered the wretched inhabitants. When the British detachment arrived to give protection to this part of the country, the number of inhabited houses in Heriurn was reduced to seven; but above 300 have been since rebuilt. In this part of the country there are no slaves, the work being performed by hired labourers. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nHETTOWRA, (or Etowdah).\u2014A town in the Nepaul territories. Lat. 27\u00b0. 14'. N. Long. 85\u00b0. 22'. E.\n\nAlthough this is a place of much occasional resort, on account of its being the centre of all the commerce carried on between the Nepaul dominions and those of Oude and of the Company, yet it is but a miserable village, containing from 50 to 60 houses, and is considered very unhealthy. The Rapti on which Hettowra stands issues from a mountain to the eastward of Checsapany, and falls into the Guaduck, 15 miles north of Somaisir.\n\nThe village of Hittowra stands at the foot of a hilly ridge, at the point where the Rapti enters the Mocwanpoor valley. The Rapti abounds with fish, which the natives consume in large quantities. From hence north, merchandize can only be transported on the shoulders of hill porters, whose rate of labour is regulated by the Nepaul government. The road by Hittowra from Bengal is impassable during the periodical rains; the little intercourse betwixt Nepaul and the Terriani, or low country, is then kept up by the routes of Mocwanpoor and Sundooli. (Kirkpatrick, &c.)\n\nHIDJELLEE, (Hijali).\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, situated on the west bank of the Hooghly River, 55 miles S. S. W. from Calcutta. Lat. 21\u00b0. 50'. N. Long. 88\u00b0. 10'. E.\n\nDuring the Mogul government, Hidjellee was the capital of a Foujdarry or military station, comprehending 1098 square miles. This small district is situated on the low margin of the River Hooghly, where it unites with the Bay of Bengal. It was first dismembered from the Soubah of Orissa, and annexed to Bengal, in the reign of Shah Jehan. It is fertile in grain, and furnishes a great quantity of excellent salt.\n\nThe land about Hidjellee is of two descriptions; the first, fresh or arable, is preserved from the inundation of the tides by embankments, running parallel to, and at some dist-\nance from the rivers and numerous inlets, which intersect the whole territory. The second, or salt land, is that portion exposed to the overflowing of the tides, usually called the churs or banks; where mounds of earth, strongly impregnated with saline particles, named kalaries or working places, are formed. Each of these heaps is estimated on a medium to yield 233 maunds (80 lbs each) of salt, requiring the labour of seven manufacturers; who, by an easy process of filtration and boiling, are enabled to complete their operations from November to June, before the setting in of the periodical rains.\n\nIn 1687, during a rupture with Aurengzebe, the East India Company's forces took and fortified Hidjellee, and destroyed above 40 sail of the emperor's vessels. They afterwards repulsed the repeated attacks made by the Nabob of Bengal, notwithstanding the garrison was in a very sickly state. (J. Grant, Bruce, &c.)\n\nHilsah.\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, 20 miles S. S. E. from Patna. Lat. 25\u00b0. 18'. N. Long. 85\u00b0. 20'. E.\n\nHimaleh Mountains.(Himalaya).\u2014A stupendous range of mountains, which form the proper boundary of Hindostan to the north, and separate it from the elevated region usually designated by the names of Great and Little Tibet.\n\nOn the west, about Lat. 34\u00b0. 30'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. E. this immense chain joins the Cashmere Mountains, the northern range of which may be considered as a continuation of the great Himalaya ridge. The direction is afterwards S. E. to the Bootan country, which they separate from Tibet about Lat. 28\u00b0. N. and Long. 90\u00b0. E. from whence they still extend eastward, until their termination is lost in an unexplored country to the north of Assam. As the great River Brahmapootra enters Assam with a very considerable volume of water, it is supposed to wind round the eastern extremity of the range, probably about the 95th degree of east longitude.\n\nThe extreme height of Himalaya is yet a desideratum; but by a mean of numerous altitudes of a conspicuous peak, taken with an excellent instrument, and every due precaution observed, its height above the plains of Rohilcund was calculated at 21,000 feet. From the summit of these mountains the country declines in height to the south, but not gradually, the surface being irregularly mountainous to the borders of Bengal, Oude, and Delhi, where the plains commence, which extend south-eastward to the sea.\n\nFrom the western side of the mountains arise streams tributary to the Indus, and perhaps the Indus itself. From the other side of this highest land (the remotest fountains marking the greatest elevation) a declivity to the north and west gives to the mountain streams, and finally to the rivers they compose, a northerly or westerly direction. It is probable the sources of the Sanpoo, or Brahmapootra, and its tributary streams, are separated only by a narrow range of snow-clad peaks from the sources of the rivers which constitute the Ganges, and that the province of Lahdack declines from its southern limits to the north and west. Intelligent natives, who have in pilgrimages, and on business, traversed the northern skirt of Himalaya, assert that no river except one, (the Sutuleje) exists westward of the Manasaravara Lake, and that it turns southerly west from Jamoutri.\n\nThe snowy mountains seen from Hindostan, and especially from Rohilcund, are probably the highest ground between the level plains of India and the elevated regions of Southern Tartary, and throughout their whole extent rear their heads far above the line of perpetual snow. They certainly are not surpassed in height by any other chain of mountains, if they be even equalled by the Cordilleras of the Andes. In\ndifferent parts of their immense extent they receive different names, such as Himadri, Himavat, and Himalaya, the last being the most common, and the whole in signification having a reference to snow and cold. They are the Emaus and Emodus of ancient geographers.\n\nIn the Hindu Pantheon Himalaya is deified, and described as the father of the Ganges and her sister Ooma; the latter being the spouse of Mahadeva, the destroying power. (Co'ebrooke, Webb, Ramayana, &c.)\n\nHindia, (Hindya).\u2014A district in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Khandesh, bounded on the north by the Nerbuddah, and on the south by the Callygong Hills, and situated between the 22d and 23d degrees of north latitude. By Abul Fazel it is described as belonging to the province of Malwah, which in modern times has the Nerbuddah for its southern boundary.\n\n\"Sircar Hindych, containing 23 mahals, measurement 89,573 bee-gals. Revenue 11,610,959 dams. Seynrghal 157,054 dams. This sircar furnishes 1296 cavalry, and 592 infantry.\"\n\nHindia.\u2014A town in the province of Khandesh, the capital of a district of the same name, and situated on the south side of the Nerbuddah River. Lat. 22\u00b0. 31'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 10'. E.\n\nTravelling distance 116 miles S.E. from Oojain.\n\nHindoloo.\u2014A town in the province of Cuttack, 30 miles S.W. from Cuttack. Lat. 20\u00b0. 23'. N. Long. 83\u00b0. 45'. E.\n\nHindone.\u2014A town in the province of Agra, 65 miles S.W. from the city of Agra. Lat. 26\u00b0. 45'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. E. This was formerly a large city, and still contains extensive buildings, but from the depredations of the Maharattas is now thinly inhabited. To the south of this town there is much forest, and but little cultivation. (Hunter, &c.)\n\nHindoo Kho Mountains, (Hindu Coh, the Indian Mountain).\u2014An extensive ridge of mountains, the boundary of the province of Cabul on the N.W. separating it from Balk and Budakshan. This chain takes a N.E. direction between Bamian and Anderab, from whence its general direction is between the E. and the N.E. towards the sources of the Jihon, at about 100 miles to the east of the city of Badakshan. The term Hindoo Kho is not applied to this ridge throughout its whole extent, but is confined to that part of it which forms the N.W. boundary of Cabul, which is the Indian Caucasus of Alexander. Between the mountains of Hindoo Kho, and those of Candahar, the country takes the form of an extensive valley from Cabul to the borders of Khorasan. (Rennel, &c.)\n\nHINDOSTAN, (Hindust'han).\n\nThis extensive region is situated in the south-eastern quarter of Asia, and is nearly comprehended between the eighth and 35th degrees of north latitude, and the 72d and 92d of east longitude.\n\nAccording to the ancients India, on its most enlarged scale, comprised an area of 40 degrees on each side, including a space almost as large as all Europe; being divided on the west from Persia by the Arachosian Mountains; limited on the east by the Chinese part of the peninsula beyond the Ganges; confined on the north by the wilds of Tartary; and extending to the south as far as the Sunda Isles. These expanded limits comprehended the stupendous hills of Potyid, or Tibet, the romantic valley of Cashmere, and all the domains of the old Indoseythians, the countries of Nepaul and Bootan, Cannroop and Assam, together with Siam, Ava, Araean, and the bordering kingdoms as far as the China of the Hindoos, and the Sin of the Arabian geographers; the whole Western Peninsula, and the Island of Ceylon.\n\nBy the Mahommedan writers the\nterm Hindostan was understood to signify the country in immediate subjection to the sovereigns of Delhi, which, in 1582, was subdivided by the Emperor Acher into 11 soubahs, or provinces; and which, in spite of the many changes they have since undergone, still nearly retain their geographical formation. The names of these provinces are Lahore, Multan, including Sinde, Ajmeer, Delhi, Agra, Allahabad, Bahar, Oude, Bengal, Malwah, and Gujrat. A 12th soubah was formed of Cabul, and the countries west of the Indus; and three new ones were afterwards added out of the conquests in the Deccan, viz. Berar, Khandesh, and Ahmednuggur, afterwards Aurungabad.\n\nIn place of the above arbitrary descriptions of Hindostan, it is preferable to adopt the limits assigned by the original Hindoo inhabitants, and by them referred to in all their writings, which have also the advantage of being singularly well defined.\n\nAccording to this arrangement, Hindostan is bounded on the north by the lofty Himalaya ridge of mountains, which commences near the Indus, about the 35th degree of north latitude, and confines Cashmere on the north, extending from thence in an uninterrupted chain beyond the utmost eastern extremity of Hindostan, including in that region all the hilly districts now subject to Nepaul, and also the country belonging to the Deb Rajah of Bootan. To the south Hindostan is everywhere bounded by the ocean, and to the west by the River Indus. To the east the limits are more difficult to ascertain, but the most distinct are the eastern hills and forests of Tippoorah and Chittagong, which stretch north nearly to the Brahmapootra, about the 92d degree of east longitude. With the exception of Bootan, the primitive Brahminical religion and languages prevail within the boundaries above specified; nor is it to be found beyond them with the exception of Assam and Cassay, which are both provinces in which the Brahminical doctrines are still cultivated, while Bootan is possessed by the adherents of Buddha.\n\nIt is difficult to discover any name applied by the Brahmins to the country over which their doctrines have extended, and which they generally describe by a circumlocution. Sometimes they give it the epithets of Medhyana, or central, and Punyabhumi, or land of virtues; and assert it to have been the portion of Bharat (one of nine brothers, whose father ruled the whole earth), and named after him Bharata Khanda. This domain of Bharat they consider as the centre of Jambudwipa, which the Tibetians call the Land of Zambu. At other times they describe their country as the region between the Himalaya Mountains and Ramiswara (the Straits of Ceylon). The modern name Hindoostan is a Persian appellation derived from the words Hindoo, black, and st'han place, but it has been adopted for ages back by the natives of all religions.\n\nTaking Hindostan within the limits described above, it comprehends an area, and may be considered of about 1,020,000 geographical square miles, in modern times as subdivided into four large portions.\n\n1st. Northern Hindostan. This division comprehends Cashmere on the west, and Bootan on the east, with all the intermediate hilly provinces, situated between the first range of mountains that rise from the plains on the northern frontiers of Delhi, Oude, Bahar, and Bengal, and the lofty Himalaya ridge bordering on Tibet. The whole tract of country last mentioned is subject to the Ghoorkhali state of Nepaul, and having been but little explored, even the names of the different districts are not satisfactorily established. The most commonly-received appellations by which they are distinguished are Serinagur, or Gerwal, Badrycazrama, Kemaoon, Jenlah, the 24 Rajahs, Lamjungh, Gorcah,\nNepaul, Mocwanpoor, Morung, and Kyraut. The inhabitants of this wild country having never been permanently subdued, and but rarely invaded, have probably remained in their present stage of civilization from the most remote ages.\n\n2d. Hindostan Proper. This division comprehends the 11 large soubahs, or provinces, formed by the Emperor Acher, and is bounded on the south by the Nerbuddah River, where the Deccan commences. The names of these provinces are Lahore, Mooltan, including Sinde, Gujrat, Ajmeer, Delhi, Agra, Malwak, Allahabad, Oude, Bahar, and Bengal. This tract of country may be considered as the most civilized and richest part of Hindostan, and contained the seats of the most famous empires, both Hindoo and Mahomedan, having been repeatedly invaded and subjugated by the more hardy tribes of the north. The inhabitants of this region also (Bengal excepted) may be considered as a superior race to the population of the other divisions, possessing a more robust frame of body, and excelling also in intellectual qualities.\n\nThe third grand division is the Deccan, which is bounded on the north by the course of the Nerbuddah River, and from its source by an imaginary line extending in the same parallel of latitude to the mouth of the Hooghly, or western branch of the Ganges. To the south the boundaries of the Deccan are the Krishna and Malpurba Rivers. Within this space are comprehended the provinces of Aurungabad, Khandesh, Beder, Hyderabad, Nandere, the Northern Circars, Berar, Gundwana, Orissa, and great part of Bejaipoor; and having been invaded at a much later period than Hindostan Proper, it contains a much greater proportion of Hindoo inhabitants, who also retain more of their original manners and institutions.\n\nThe fourth and last division is the South of India, which has the figure of a triangle, of which its northern boundary, the River Krishna, is the base, and the Coasts of Coromandel and Malabar the sides. The provinces comprehended in this division are a small part of Bejaipoor, the Balaghaud Ceded Districts, the Carnatic Northern, Central, and Southern, Mysore, Canara, Malabar, Barumahal, Coimbetoor, Dindigul, Salem, and Kistnagherry, Cochin, and Travaucor. In this division of Hindostan the Mahomedans did not gain a footing until a very recent period, and some part was never subdued by them at all.\n\nEach of these provinces being particularly described under their respective heads, the reader is referred to them for further topographical information, it being here intended to exhibit only such observations as apply to Hindostan generally.\n\nHindostan is watered by many noble rivers, which have retained their ancient appellations better than the cities or provinces; the latter having often had their names altered from vanity, or from religious motives. The principal rivers in point of magnitude are the Brahmapootra, the Ganges, the Indus, the Sutulejic, the Krishna, the Godavery, the Jumna, the Nerbuddah, the Cavery, the Goggrah, the Tuptee, the Mahanuddy, the Megna, the Soane, the Chunbul, the Beyah, the Gunduck, and the Ravey.\n\nThe most remarkable mountains are the great Himalaya ridge, which bound Hindostan on the north, the hills of Kemaoon and Sewalic, the Eastern and Western Ghauts, and the Vindhyan chain of mountains, which cross India nearly parallel to the course of the Nerbuddah, and pass through the provinces of Bahar and Benares.\n\nAll the chief towns of Hindostan are now possessed by the British, but no exact report of their population has ever been published. The three largest and most populous are Surat, Benares, and Calcutta; the next in rank are Delhi, Madras, Bombay, Agra, Lucknow, Patna,\nMoorshedabad, Dacca, Poonah, Hyderabad in the Deccan, Nagpoor, Catmandoo, Oojain, Jyenaugur, Amritsir, Lahore, and Seringapatam.\n\nGenerally speaking the description of one Indian city is the description of all, they being all built on one plan, with exceeding narrow confined crooked streets, a great number of tanks and reservoirs, with numerous gardens interspersed. A few of the streets are paved with brick. The houses are variously built, some of brick, others of mud, and a still greater proportion with bamboos and mats. These different fabrics standing intermixed with each other, present a very motley and irregular appearance. The brick houses are seldom higher than two stories, and have flat terraced roofs. The mud and thatch houses greatly outnumber the other sort; so that fires, which are remarkably frequent, seldom meet with the interruption of a brick building throughout a whole street.\n\nThe harvest in Hindostan Proper is divided into two periods, the Kheereef and the Rubbee; the former is cut in September and October, the latter in March and April. In travelling through Hindostan some opinion may be formed of the wisdom of the government and condition of the people, from the number and state of preservation of the water courses for the irrigation of the fields. Rice is the principal article of nourishment of the natives, and the first object of attention in the cultivation of it is to have the soil plentifully supplied with water.\n\nThe institution of public inns, for the accommodation of travellers, seems very ancient in Hindostan. At a more recent period they were regulated by Shere Shah, who appointed a particular tribe to take charge of them. In many places where public buildings for that purpose are wanting, the streets, or open spots, in which a few families of this tribe and profession have taken up their abode, are dignified with the name of serais, and may be called private inns. Public serais, together with wells and resting places, have always been more numerous in Hindostan Proper, in the Deccan, and South of India, than in Bengal. They are still so, and the reason is obvious; travelling by land is more frequent there, while travelling by water is more common in Bengal.\n\nThat the Hinduos were in early ages a commercial people we have many reasons to believe; and, in the first of their sacred law tracts, which they suppose to have been revealed by Menu many millions of years ago, there is a curious passage respecting the legal interest of money, and the limited rate of it in different cases, with an exception in regard to adventures by sea. The three great articles of general importation from India by the Greeks and Romans were, 1st. spices and aromatics; 2dly. precious stones and pearls; 3dly. silk. Their exports to India were woollen cloth of a slight fabric, linen in chequer work, some precious stones, and some aromatics unknown in India, coral, storax, glass vessels of different kinds, wrought silver, Italian, Greek, and Arabian wines, brass, tin, lead, girdles and sashes, melilot white glass, red arsenic, black lead, and gold and silver. Of this last the influx to Hindostan has always been very great; as the natives sell a great deal, and purchase little, the balance is consequently always in their favour. It is supposed a great deal is annually lost by being concealed under ground by the natives, many of whom die without revealing the place of their hidden treasure; and the amount must be considerable, as the practice of this species of hoarding is universal among all ranks of Hindoos.\n\nFor many centuries past cotton piece goods have been the staple manufacture of Hindostan. The various sorts fabricated in different provinces, from the northern mountains to Cape Comorin, are too numerous to admit of minute detail;\nbut some sketch of them, and of other commercial productions, will be found under the description of different places.\n\nThere are many shades of difference in the characters of the Hindoos inhabiting the different parts of this immense region. Travelling through India centrally, from Ceylon (for example) up the Carnatic, the Deccan and Bengal to Cashmere, an extent of about 25 degrees of latitude, a very great variety of habits, languages, religious observances, &c., are perceptible, almost as great as a native of India would observe in the several nations were he travelling in Europe. The character of the Maharattas, nurtured in war and predation, differs from that of the more peaceable provinces of the south. Those who inhabit the northern territories between the Nerbudah and the Attock are almost all a military tribe, the caste of Rajpoots and Rajjwars, who are governed by petty princes, and divided into small independent states, in continual conflict with each other. These differ still more from the placid natives of Bengal and the southern provinces, and even from the tribes of the Maharatta nation, to whom the Rajpoots are a superior race.\n\nIn adverting to the incessant revolutions of these countries, it is a very remarkable fact, that in the whole scheme of polity, whether of the victors or of the vanquished, the idea of civil liberty had never entered into their contemplation, and is to this day without a name in the languages of Asia. The Seiks, when they rejected the Hindoo religion for that of Nanek Shah, exhibited the first and only instance in the history of the east of an approach, however imperfect, to republican principles.\n\nIn the principal settlements, and in some of the larger towns under the British, there are many natives who purchase articles of luxury, such as broad cloth, watches, and other articles; but their superfluous wealth is generally expended in feasts, marriages, and in other modes more connected with the usages and manners of their own country. Some few imitate the European manners, and almost adopt their dress; but they invariably, both Mahomedans and Hindoos, lose the estimation of their own class in proportion as they depart from its usages.\n\nAmong the poorest Hindoos the expense attending marriage is never less than the savings of three, four, or five years; among the richer class the marriage expense is only measured by the extent of their fortunes. The man is not left to his own discretion; thousands of Brahmans and mendicants attend, uninvited, the wedding of every rich person, and exact presents of money and clothes, besides the food they consume during the ceremony, which lasts several days, and half the bridegroom's fortune is frequently dissipated in this manner. The Hindoos also often squander vast sums on the obsequies of their relations; on the death of a mother particularly, a man has been known to consume his whole property, although in other respects sordid and miserly. Among the other sources of expense to a Hindoo are charitable distributions to a great extent, on the anniversary of the deaths of his ancestors.\n\nIndia was little known to the Greeks until Alexander's expedition, about 327 years before Christ. The following particulars, selected from the ancient descriptions of India by Arrian and other authors, will show how nearly the ancient inhabitants resemble the present.\n\n1. The slender make of their bodies.\n2. Their living on vegetable food.\n3. Distribution into sects and classes.\n4. Marriages at seven years of age, and the prohibition of marriages between different castes.\n5. The men wearing ear-rings and party coloured shoes, also veils covering the head and part of the shoulders.\n6. Daubing their faces with colours.\n7. Only the principal persons having umbrellas carried over them.\n8. Two handed swords and bows drawn by the feet.\n9. The manner of taking elephants the same as at present.\n10. Manufactures of cotton of extraordinary whiteness.\n11. Monstrous ants, by which the termites or white ants are meant.\n12. Wooden houses on the banks of large rivers to be occasionally removed as the river changed its course.\n13. The tala tree, or tal, a kind of palm.\n14. The banyan tree, and the Indian devotees sitting under them.\n\nThe Greeks have not left us any means of knowing with accuracy what vernacular languages they found in India on their arrival. The radical language of Hindostan is the Sanscrit; of which such is the antiquity, that neither history nor tradition have preserved any account of a people of whom it was the living tongue. From this source the most ancient derivatives are the Prakrit, the Bali, and the Zend. The Prakrit is the language which contains the greater part of the sacred books of the Jainas; the Bali is equally revered among the followers of Buddha; while the Zend, or sacred language of ancient Persia, has long enjoyed a similar rank among the Parsees, or worshippers of fire, and been the depository of the sacred books of Zoroaster. These three languages, the Prakrit, Bali, and Zend, have been regularly cultivated and fixed by composition.\n\nThere is reason to believe that 10 polished dialects formerly prevailed in as many different civilized nations, who occupied the whole extent of Hindostan. The Saraswata, the Kanoge, the Gour, the Tirhoot, and the Orissa, were denominated the five Gaurs: the five Dravirs are, the Dravira or Tamul, the Maharatta, the Carnata, the Telinga, and the Garjara.\n\nAfter excluding the mountaineers, who are probably the aborigines of India, and whose languages have no affinity with Sanscrit, there yet remains in the mountains and islands contiguous to India many tribes, who seem to be degenerate Hindoos. Each province and district in India has its peculiar dialect, but they all seem to be varieties of some one among the 10 principal idioms. The Hindostani, or Hindi, seems to be the lineal descendant of the Kanoge.\n\nThe political governments of Hindostan are in a perpetual state of fluctuation. So far from having any established system, the effect of which is to afford protection to their weaker against their more powerful neighbours, the exact reverse is the case; the object of every native state separately, and of all collectively, being to destroy the weak. The great mass of the people entertain no attachment to any set of political principles, or to any form of government; and they have so long been accustomed to revolutions, and frequently changes of territory and masters, that they obey with little repugnance whoever is placed over them, expecting his sway, like that of his predecessor, to be transitory. They are solicitous only for the toleration of their religious doctrines, rites, and prejudices, of their ancient customs and manners, and for the security of their domestic concerns.\n\nThe natives, in general, do not look upon the crime of treason against the state in the light we do. In fidelity and attachment to a master or chief, whoever he may be, they are not surpassed by any people; but those who stand in the mere relation of subjects, without being in the service or pay of the supreme power, do not feel themselves bound by any very strong tie of allegiance. They have no idea of loyalty or disloyalty, except to the masters who support them.\n\nThe native princes of Hindostan\nbear a great affection to their children during their infancy; but as soon as these arrive at the age of emancipation, the perpetual intrigues of an Indian court render them from being the consolation of their parents\u2014the object of their mistrust. There are never wanting intriguers who engage them in parties, and even in plots; from which it often happens, that a prince, in his latter days, lives without affection for his own sons, and gives a kind of paternal preference to his grand-children; and this recurs so frequently to observation, that one of the eastern poets has said, that the parents have during the life of their sons such overweening affection for their grand-children, because they see in them the enemies of their enemies.\n\nIn Hindostan there are no titles of nobility exactly similar to those of Europe, nor are they generally hereditary. According to oriental ideas, honours or titles conferred by the sovereign power must be accompanied by a jaghire, and generally by a military command along with the title, which in itself is considered merely as an appellation attached to the acquisition of emolument or power; and it is quite impossible to impress the minds of the natives with the value of a mere name. On this subject their ideas are more simple and natural than ours. If an unfit person received a patent for the title of an ameer or rajah, he would not be able to retain it; for when a man has nothing left of dignity but the name, in India it soon wears away. On the other hand, if a Hindoo should emerge from poverty and obscurity, and attain great wealth and celebrity, he would, if he wished it, without any formal investiture, be saluted rajah. He would be considered as having acquired a claim to the title, in the same manner as other persons acquire, by learning the appellation of Moulavy and Pundit, which becomes amongst the mass of the people inseparably attached to their names.\n\nFor these 10 years past, from the comparative tranquillity Hindostan has enjoyed, a sort of breathing time and freedom from military devastation, which had been for nearly a century wholly unknown, and which, if of much longer duration, must gradually operate a change in the manners and habits of the people. The Durgah Poojah is distinguished as the particular period when the armies of the native princes have always been accustomed to take the field; and it was seldom any of their troops assembled in the field until after the celebration of the Dussera, which happens on the first full moon after the autumnal equinox. The dewali, or next new moon, was commonly the time to set their troops in motion, and some notion of the destruction that marked their course may be formed from the description of what the natives term a wulsa.\n\nOn the approach of a hostile army the unfortunate inhabitants of India bury under ground their most burdensome effects; and each individual, man, woman, and child, above six years of age, (the infant children being carried by their mothers) with a load of grain proportioned to their strength, issue from their homes, and take the direction of a country (if such can be found) exempt from the miseries of war; sometimes of a strong fortress, but more generally of the most unfrequented hills and woods, where they prolong a miserable existence until the departure of the enemy; and should this be protracted beyond the time for which they have provided food, a great proportion of them necessarily die of hunger. The people of a district thus deserting their homes are the wulsa of the district, for which there is no corresponding word in any European language, it being only possible to express it by circumlocution. It is a proud distinction, that the wulsa never migrates on the approach of a British army, when unaccompanied by Indian allies.\n\nThe two great religious sects in\nHindostan are the Mahommedans and the Hindoos, who, although equally attached to their respective faiths, exhibit a considerable contrast in their doctrinal tenets. The Koran enjoins the Mahommedans to make converts of the whole world by the edge of the sword; the Vedas proscribe the whole world, and admit of no proselytes of any description. Eight hundred years ago the Mahommedans cut the throats of the Hindoos, because they refused to be circumcised; but the two religions have existed together for so long a period, that the professors of both have acquired a habit of looking on each other with an indulgence unusual in other countries. This degree of complaisance is not surprising in the disciple of Brahma, whose maxim is, that the various modes of worship practised by the different nations of the earth spring alike from the deity, and are all equally acceptable to him. But even the sectaries of the intolerant doctrines of the Koran are no longer those furious and sanguinary zealots, who, in the name of God and his prophet, spread desolation and slaughter, demolishing the Hindoo temples, and erecting mosques on their ruins. They found the patient constancy of the Hindoo superior to their violence; but that, if left in possession of his tenets, he was a peaceable, industrious, and valuable subject. We observe, in consequence, among the Mahommedans of Hindostan a deference for the prejudices of their neighbours, or dependents of the Hindoo persuasion. A spirit of foreign conquest, and still more a zeal for the propagation of their religious tenets, appear incompatible with the genius of the Hindoo Brahminical system; but the disciples of Buddha are not equally free from them. Throughout Hindostan generally there are still 10 Hindoos to one Mahommedan, but the proportion varies in every district.\n\nFive great sects of Hindoos exclusively worship a single deity; one recognizes the five divinities that are adored by the other sects respectively; but the followers of this comprehensive scheme mostly select one object of daily devotion, and pay adoration to the other duties on particular occasions only. Upon the whole, the Hindoo system, when examined, will be found consistent with monotheism, though it contains the seeds of polytheism and idolatry. The Vaishnavas, though nominally worshippers of Vishnu, are in fact votaries of deified heroes.\n\nThe worship of Rama and Crisha by the Vaishnavas, and that of Mahadeva and Bhavani by the Saivas and Sactas, appear to have been introduced since the persecution of the Bhanddas and Jains. The institution of the Vedas are anterior to Buddha, whose theology appears to have been borrowed from the system of Capila, whose most conspicuous practical doctrine is stated to have been the unlawfulness of killing animals. The overthrow of the sect of Buddha in Hindostan has not effected the full revival of the religious system inculcated in the Vedas. Most of what is there taught is now obsolete; and, in its stead, new orders of devotees have been instituted, with new forms of religious ceremonies. Rituals, founded on the Puranas and Tantras, have in a great measure antiquated the institutions of the Vedas. In particular, the sacrifice of animals before the goddess Cali, and the adoration of Rama and Krishna, have succeeded to that of the elements and planets. Sir William Jones was of opinion, that we might fix the existence of Buddha, or the ninth great incarnation of Vishnu, in the year 1014, before the birth of Christ. The earliest accounts of India by the Greeks, who visited the country, describe its inhabitants as divided into separate tribes; consequently, a sect like the modern Buddhists, which has no distinction of caste, could not have then been the most prevalent in India.\nThe 10 avatars, or incarnations of Vishnu, are arranged and named as follow:\n\n1. Matsya, or the fish.\n2. Kurma, or the tortoise.\n3. Varaha, or the boar.\n4. Narasingha, or the man-lion.\n5. Vamana, or the dwarf.\n6. Parasu Rama.\n7. Rama.\n8. Krishna.\n9. Buddha, (2828 years ago).\n10. Kalki, or the horse, (not yet come).\n\nAs the Hindoos believe that mortals may acquire supernatural powers by the performance of penances and austerities, it may be instructive to specify those performed by Tarika, through the powerful efficacy of which he had nearly dethroned the gods. In the prosecution of this task it is related he went through the following series of 11 distinct mortifications, each of which lasted 100 years.\n\n1. He stood on one foot holding the other, and both hands up to heaven, with his eyes fixed on the sun.\n2. He stood on one great toe.\n3. He took as sustenance nothing but water.\n4. He subsisted in the same manner on air.\n5. He remained in the water.\n6. He was buried in the earth, but continued, as under his last infliction, in incessant adoration.\n7. The same penance in fire.\n8. He stood on his head, with his feet upwards.\n9. He stood on one hand.\n10. He hung by his hands on a tree.\n11. He hung on a tree with his head downwards.\n\nSuch perseverance was irresistible; and Indra, with the other demi-gods, alarmed lest their sovereignty should be usurped by the potency of the penance, resorted to Brahma for protection; but the destruction of Tarika could be effected by nothing less than an incarnation of Mahadeva, which after some time took place under the form of Carticeya, the Hindoo Mars.\n\nProdigality, or carelessness of life, has always been a remarkable feature in the Hindoo character; hence has arisen such a number of voluntary sacrifices as no religion can probably outnumber. Besides a meritorious suffering for religion's sake, suicide is in many cases legal and even commendable; such as the self immolation of a widow with her husband's corpse. Among the men, drowning themselves in holy rivers is of late oftener resorted to than burning; persons afflicted with loathsome or incurable diseases have not unfrequently caused themselves to be buried alive. In Berar and Gundwana they throw themselves from a precipice situated between the Taptee and Nerbuddah River. Abul Fazel mentions, that when suicide is meritorious, there are five modes of performing it preferable to others.\n\n1st. By starving.\n2d. Being covered with dry cow-dung, and consumed with fire.\n3d. Being buried in snow.\n4th. Going to Sagor Island, at the mouth of the Bhagirathi, or sacred branch of the Ganges, and there devoured by sharks or alligators.\n5th. Cutting the throat at Allahabad, at the holy junction of the Ganges and Jumna.\n\nIn establishing their religious structures and places of pilgrimage the Hindoos have always shown a predilection for places near the sea, the sources of rivers, the tops of remarkable hills, and retired places of difficult access, to which the extraordinary length and toil of the journey attached a superior degree of merit. This is exemplified in the pilgrimages to Juggernaut and Ramesseram; to the wilds of Purwuttun; to Tripetty; to the sources of the Godavery at Trimbuc Nasser, and of the Krishna at Balisur. The principal architectural monuments of Hindoo superstition are to be found in the Carnatic and south of India; in Bengal there is no reli-\ngious edifice of any magnitude or reputation.\n\nThe Hindoos universally shave the whole head, except a small tuft on the crown, which is the distinguishing mark of a Hindoo. When a man becomes a sanyassee, that is, when he renounces all expectation of salvation, or any other benefit from his deeds, he relinquishes this mark, and shaves the whole head; and the same happens when he becomes an apostate, and associates with Christians and Mahommedans, and is thereby rejected from his caste.\n\nThe religion of the Hindoos is without any acknowledged individual superior, but the pre-eminence of the Brahmans is never disputed by the other castes. The peculiar duty of a Brahmin is meditation on things divine, and the proper manner of his procuring a subsistence is by begging\u2014all industry being deemed derogatory to his rank. The majority of Brahmans may, and do eat animal food; priests, while officiating as such, perhaps do not; but, though all priests are Brahmans, all Brahmans are not priests. It is probable that a majority of Brahmans eat animal food, and that nine-tenths may if they please. Hindoos of pure descent seldom eat animal food, except such as has been sacrificed to the gods. Many learned natives of Hindostan assert, that the Brahminical tribes are not natives of the country, but came from the north through the Hurdwar Pass, and formed their first settlement at Kanoge. The Hindoos, in general, will seldom allow their own caste to have had any beginning, but insist that it has existed from all eternity, or, at least, from the first origin of things.\n\nThe four great classes of Hindoos never intermarry, nor eat, but with particular families of the same tribe in their own class. It is generally, but erroneously supposed, that persons of the same caste will communicate with one another all over India, and eat together of food dressed by another; but this is by no means the case, the communication being confined to a few families in their own neighbourhood, whom they know to be strict observers of the rules relative to their caste. As far as refers to them, the rest of the same tribe are in a manner outcasts.\n\nThere is scarcely one point in their mythological religion that the whole race of Hindoos have faith in. There are sectaries and schismatics without end, who will believe only certain points, which the others abjure. Individuals of those sects dissent from the doctrines believed by the majority, and the philosophical sceptics will scarcely believe anything in opposition to their more docile brethren, who disbelieve nothing; there being, in fact, no orthodoxy among Hindoos. All Hindoos profess a belief in the deity, to whom they assign similar attributes; but, when an interposing avatara, or incarnation, is to be received, a contest ensues, and it is received, rejected, or modified, according to the feelings or interests of individuals.\n\nBad as the Hindoo religion, in many respects is, there is reason to suppose it originally superseded something still worse. A parallel to some of the most unnatural, absurd, and barbarous usages of the Eastern Isles may be found in India and China, and both Indian and Indo Chinese monuments contain many allusions to a state of society and manners on the continent, similar to that which subsists among the most barbarous of the tribes of the Eastern Archipelago. From this we may infer, that the religions of Brahma and Buddha supplanted a much more dreadful superstition, and brutal state of existence; and it is probable, if precipitation and coercion be avoided, they also, in process of time, will yield to the superior purity of the Christian doctrines.\nFor the Chronology of Hindostan the reader is referred to the words Ghizni and Delhi; but, before concluding the present article, it may be useful to exhibit an abstract view of the present state of Hindostan, and its modern rulers, with an estimate of the extent of their territories, and the number of inhabitants they contain. In a computation of this nature, strict accuracy must not be looked for; but even an approximation to the reality may be productive of information. At present Hindostan may be divided into the following portions:\n\n1st. British Hindostan, or provinces under the immediate jurisdiction of the British government.\n\n2d. Territories possessed by princes tributary to the British, or protected by a subsidiary force, and completely under British influence.\n\n3d. Independent principalities of established note.\n\n4th. The territories of petty chiefs of all descriptions; also independent,\n\n| Geographical Square Miles | Population |\n|---------------------------|------------|\n| Bengal, Bahar, and Benares | 162,000     | 29,000,000 |\n| Acquisitions in Hindostan Proper and Orissa since 1799 | 60,000     | 10,000,000 |\n\nUnder the Bengal Presidency\n\n| Geographical Square Miles | Population |\n|---------------------------|------------|\n| 222,000                   | 39,000,000 |\n\nUnder the Madras Presidency\n\n| Geographical Square Miles | Population |\n|---------------------------|------------|\n| 125,000                   | 12,000,000 |\n\nDitto of the Bombay Presidency\n\n| Geographical Square Miles | Population |\n|---------------------------|------------|\n| 10,000                    | 2,500,000 |\n\nTotal of British Hindostan\n\n| Geographical Square Miles | Population |\n|---------------------------|------------|\n| 357,000                   | 53,500,000 |\n\nBRITISH ALLIES AND TRIBUTARIES.\n\n| Geographical Square Miles | Population |\n|---------------------------|------------|\n| The Nizam                 | 76,000     | 8,000,000 |\n| The Peshwa and Guicowar   | 53,000     | 5,000,000 |\n| Nabob of Oude             | 13,000     | 2,000,000 |\n| Mysore Rajah              | 22,000     | 2,000,000 |\n| Travancor and Cochin Rajahs | 5,000     | 500,000 |\n\nTotal under British jurisdiction and influence\n\n| Geographical Square Miles | Population |\n|---------------------------|------------|\n| 526,000                   | 71,000,000 |\n\nINDEPENDENT PRINCIPALITIES.\n\nUnder the dominion and influence of Sindia, Holcar, and other Maharatta Chiefs\n\n| Geographical Square Miles | Population |\n|---------------------------|------------|\n| 75,000                    | 6,000,000 |\n\nDitto of the Nagpoor Rajah\n\n| Geographical Square Miles | Population |\n|---------------------------|------------|\n| 58,000                    | 3,000,000 |\n\nDitto of the Nepaul Rajah\n\n| Geographical Square Miles | Population |\n|---------------------------|------------|\n| 63,000                    | 2,000,000 |\n\nDitto of the Lahore Rajah and the Seiks\n\n| Geographical Square Miles | Population |\n|---------------------------|------------|\n| 54,000                    | 4,000,000 |\n\nTotal of Hindostan\n\n| Geographical Square Miles | Population |\n|---------------------------|------------|\n| 776,000                   | 86,000,000 |\n\nUnder the Rajahs of Jondpoor, Jyenagur, Odeypoor, and other Rajpoot Chiefs; the Ameers of Sinde, the Cabul government, and Chief of Cashmere; the Rajahs of Bootan, Assam; and innumerable Goand, Coolec, and other petty Native Chiefs\n\n| Geographical Square Miles | Population |\n|---------------------------|------------|\n| 244,000                   | 15,000,000 |\n\nTotal of Hindostan\n\n| Geographical Square Miles | Population |\n|---------------------------|------------|\n| 1,020,000                 | 101,000,000 |\nAll the sea-coast of Hindostan is possessed by the British or their allies, except about 300 miles between Goa and Damaun, and part of the shore of the Gujrat Peninsula and Gulph of Cntch to the mouths of the Indus. The two last tracts are of no essential consequence, the interior being desolate, and their situation remote from the richer provinces.\n\nThe force required for retaining these extensive regions in due subordination, will be found in the following statement of the effective strength of the British army, in all parts of India, for the year 1808-9; but the number of king's troops has since been reduced.\n\n| Regiment/Company | Strength |\n|------------------|----------|\n| His majesty's dragoons | 2,636 |\n| Ditto infantry | 17,712 |\n| His majesty's troops | 20,348 |\n| Battalions artillery | 2,867 |\n| Half squadrons horse artillery | 146 |\n| Regiments of infantry | 977 |\n| Supernumeraries | 36 |\n| Company's European troops | 4,026 |\n| Total of European troops | 24,374 |\n| Regiments and troop of native cavalry | 7,781 |\n| Half squadron horse artillery | 95 |\n| Artillery Golindaze | 828 |\n| Companies artillery lascars | 5,559 |\n| Regiment infantry | 101,577 |\n| Hill rangers | 312 |\n| Escorts and detachments | 648 |\n| Battalions and companies pioneers | 1,785 |\n| Marine battalion | 750 |\n| Supernumeraries and recruits | 8,922 |\n| Ramghur battalion | 810 |\n| Total of native troops | 129,077 |\n| Total of Europeans and natives | 153,451 |\n\nIn 1805, by the returns transmitted, the number of British-born subjects in India was 31,000. Of these 22,000 were in the army as officers and privates; the civil officers of government, of all descriptions, were about 2000; the free merchants and free mariners, who resided in India under covenant, were about 5000; the officers and practitioners in the courts of judicature at the presidencies were 300; the remaining 1700 consisted of adventurers, who had smuggled themselves out in different capacities.\n\nIn 1808 the total debt owing by the British government in Hindostan amounted to 30,876,788l. which, by an adjustment of accounts with the Committee of the House of Commons, was reduced to 28,897,742l. and has since experienced still further reductions. A sinking fund was established in Bengal in the year 1799, and at Madras in the year following. These combined funds, in 1809, had reduced the debt at interest 4,038,696l. In 1812 the total revenue, of every description raised in British Hindostan, was estimated at 17 millions sterling per annum.\n\nThe dominion exercised by the East India Company, notwithstanding certain imperfections, has, on the whole, most undoubtedly been beneficial to the natives of Hindostan. The strength of the government has had the effect of securing its subjects, as well from foreign depredation, as from internal commotion. This is an advantage rarely experienced by the subjects of Asiatic states; and, combined with a domestic administration more just in its principles, and executed with far greater integrity and ability, than the native one that preceded it, may sufficiently account for the improvements that have taken place. The condition of the great mass of population is ameliorated, although the nature and circumstances of the situation in which the British government is placed,\nprescribe narrow limits to the prospects of the natives in the political and military branches of the service. Strictly speaking, however, those whom the British have superseded were themselves foreigners, who occupied all the great offices under the Mogul government, particularly in the provinces remote from the capital. (Sir William Jones, Colebrooke, Remel, Sir Henry Strachey, Wilkins, Moor, Milburn, The Marquis Wellesley, Malcolm, F. Buchanan, Wilks, Hunter, Orme, Wilford, Leyden, 5th Report, &c.)\n\n**Hissar Firozen. (Fort Victorious).**\u2014A large district in the province of Delhi, situated between the 28th and 30th degrees of north latitude. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Hissar Ferozeh, containing 27 mahals; measurement, 3,114,497 beeguls; revenue, 55,004,905 dams. Seynghal, 1,406,519 dams. This sircar furnishes 6875 cavalry, and 55,700 infantry. It has few rivers, and to procure water they are obliged to dig wells of a great depth.\"\n\nThe Hurriamneh country is included in this district, and is sometimes named the Lesser Baloochistan. The inhabitants are chiefly Jauts, with the exception of a few Rajpoots. There are also Rungar villages, which appellation is given to such of the Rajpoots as have embraced the Mahommedan religion. The Hissar or Hurriamneh districts import mathlocks, swords, coarse white cloth, salt, sugar, and a small quantity of rice, sugar, and spices. Their exports are horses, camels, bullocks, and ghee. The chief towns are Hissar, Hansy, and Ferozeh.\n\nDuring the prosperity of the Mogul empire, this district was considered as the personal estate of the heir apparent of the throne. It is now parcelled out among numerous petty native chiefs, one of whom, named Abdul Summud Khan, in 1807, made an application to the British government for assistance against the Bhattics and Abu Singh of Cut-pootlee, who had almost driven him out of the Hurriamneh, but his request was not attended to. (G. Thomas, 6th Register, Kirkpatrick, &c.)\n\n**Hissar, (Hisar).**\u2014A town in the province of Delhi, 80 miles W. from the city of Delhi. Lat. 28\u00b0. 41'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 53'. E.\n\nBy Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows: \"Hissar was founded by Sultan Feroze, who dug a canal which brings the waters of the Jumna near to the city. A derwise predicted his accession to the throne, and at his request he dug this canal, which passes through the town of Sirsa (Surfity), and loses itself in the Lake Bhera.\"\n\nSince that period the canal has been filled up, and entirely ruined, and the city is not now in a much superior condition, the country having, ever since the death of Aurengzebe, been the seat of incessant predatory warfare.\n\n**Hoewamoehil.**\u2014A peninsula joined to the Island of Ceram by a narrow isthmus called the Pass of Tanocuo, which was not only fertile in clove trees, but produced also large quantities of nutmegs. Of these last, what was called the Great Nutmeg Forest, was destroyed by the Dutch in 1667. Great quantities of sago are also produced here, which the Dutch monopolize.\n\n**Hoggy River.**\u2014This river has its source in the Rajah of Mysore's territories, near the fortress of Seva, from whence it flows in a northerly direction until it joins the Krishna, in the Adoni district.\n\n**Hog Isle.**\u2014A small island, about 20 miles in circumference, lying off the north-east extremity of Java. Lat. 7\u00b0. 5'. S. Long. 114\u00b0. 55'. E.\n\n**Hog Isle.**\u2014An island lying off the west coast of Sumatra, between the second and third degrees of north latitude. In length it may be estimated at 40 miles, by three the average breadth.\n\n**Holcar.**\u2014See Indore.\n\n**Hoodly.**\u2014See Hubely.\n\n**Hooghly, (Hugli).**\u2014A district\nin the province of Bengal, situated principally between the 22d and 23d degrees of north latitude, and extending along both sides of the River Hooghly. To the north it is bounded by the districts of Burdwan and Kishnagar; to the south by the sea; on the east by Jessore and the Sunderbunds; and on the west by Midnapoor. The whole of this district consists of low, flat land, very fertile, but overgrown with jungle in that part next the sea, which is but thinly inhabited, and remarkably unhealthy. Like the rest of the Southern Bengal districts, it has an excellent inland navigation, being intersected in every direction by rivers and their branches, which are unfortunately much infested by dacoits, or river pirates, who rob in gangs, and use torture to extort the confession of concealed property. On the banks of the sea salt of an excellent quality is manufactured for government, which, in the opinion of the natives, possesses a peculiar sanctity, on account of its being extracted from the mud of the most sacred branch of the Ganges. Although so near to Calcutta, which presents a constant market for its produce, and one of the earliest of the Company's acquisitions, three-fourths of this division remain in a state of nature\u2014the habitation of alligators, tigers, and a great variety of vermin and reptiles.\n\nHooghly.\u2014An ancient town in the province of Bengal, situated on the west side of the Hooghly River, 26 miles above Calcutta. Lat. 22\u00b0 54'. N. Long. 88\u00b0 28'. E.\n\nDuring the Mogul government this was a town of great consequence, being the Bunder, or part of the western arm of the Ganges, where the duties on merchandise were collected. The French, Dutch, Portuguese, and Danes, had each a factory here, and subsequently were permitted each to possess a town\u2014all comprehended with the extent of 10 miles along the river. Hooghly is now comparatively of little note, but is still prosperous, and well inhabited. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"There are two emporiums a mile distant from each other, one called Satgong, the other Hooghly, with its dependencies; both of which are in the possession of the Europeans.\"\u2014It is remarkable that the name of Hooghly is not mentioned in Faria de Sousa's History of Bengal, where it is named Golin.\n\nThe Dutch, in 1625, and the English, in 1640, were permitted to build factories at this place, but their trade was greatly restricted, and subject to continual exactions. In 1632 the first serious quarrel that occurred between the Moguls and Europeans happened at Hooghly, which then belonged to the Portuguese. The Moguls invested it with a strong army, and the siege continued three months and a half, during which time the Portuguese made many offers of submission, and agreed to pay a tribute; but all terms were rejected by the besiegers, who, having sprung a mine, carried the place by assault. The slaughter of the Portuguese was very great; many, in attempting to escape to their boats, were drowned; a few reached their ship in safety, but these also were immediately attacked. The captain of the largest vessel, on board which were embarked 2000 men, women, and children, with all their wealth, rather than yield to the Mahommedans, blew up his ship, and many others imitated this example. Out of 64 large vessels, 57 grabs, and 200 sloops, which were anchored opposite to the town, only one grab and two sloops got away; and these owed their escape to the bridge of boats, constructed by the Moguls below Hooghly, at Seerpoor, having been broken by catching the flames from the conflagration of the fleet. In 1686 the English were involved in hostilities by the imprudence of three of their soldiers, who quarrelled in the bazar with some of the nabob's\npeons, and were wounded. The garrison of the English factory were called out, and an action ensued, in which the nabob's troops were defeated; 60 of them being killed, a considerable number wounded, and a battery of 11 guns spiked and destroyed. At the same time the town of Hooghly was cannonaded by the fleet under Captain Nicholson, and 500 houses burned. This was the first action fought by the English in Bengal, but the result was a disgraceful peace, the Mogul government then subsisting in full vigour. An arrangement was afterwards made with the soujdar, or military superintendant of the district; but the agent and council, considering that Hooghly was an open town, retired on the 20th of December to Chuttanutee, or Calcutta. (Bruce, Stewart, Rennel, &c.)\n\n**Hooghly River.**\u2014A river in the province of Bengal, formed by the junction of Cossimbazar and Jellingshy, the two westernmost branches of the Ganges. This is the port of Calcutta, and the only branch of the Ganges that is navigated by large vessels; yet the entrance and passage are most dangerous, and the terror of strangers.\n\nWhere it is joined by the Roopnarain a very large sheet of water is formed, but it has many shoals; and as it directly faces the approach from the sea, while the Hooghly turns to the right, it occasions the loss of many vessels, which are carried up the Roopnarain by the force of the tide. The eddy caused by the bend of the Hooghly has, at this place, formed a most dangerous sand, named the James and Mary, around which the channel is never the same for a week together, requiring frequent surveys.\n\nThe Bore commences at Hooghly Point, (where the river first contracts itself) and is perceptible above Hooghly town. So quick is its motion, that it hardly employs four hours in travelling from the one to the other, although the distance is nearly 70 miles. It does not run on the Calcutta side, but along the opposite bank; from whence it crosses at Chipoor, about four miles above Fort William, and proceeds with great violence past Barnagore, Dackinsore, &c. On its approach boats must immediately quit the shore, and go for safety into the middle of the river. At Calcutta it sometimes occasions an instantaneous rise of five feet.\n\nOnly that part of the Ganges which lies in a line from Gangontri to Sagor Island is considered holy by the Hindoos, and named the Ganga or Bhagirathi. The Hooghly River therefore of Europeans is considered as the true Ganges. (Rennel, Lord Valentia, F. Buchanan, Col. Colebrooke, Elmore, &c.)\n\n**Hookery.**\u2014A town in the province of Bejapoor, 55 miles S. S. W. from Merritch. Lat. 16\u00b0. 13'. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 47'. E.\n\nThis is now a poor town, but still displays the remains of former magnificence, when it was a flourishing place under the Mahomedan government. The last of the Mogul sovereigns was Adb ul Khareed, who was dethroned by the then Rajah of Parnella, and died in the year 1643. An unsuccessful attempt was made to reinstate a surviving son; since which the Mahomedans have continued to decline, and live now in great poverty. The town still retains the distinction of giving its name to a particular species of rupee. (Moor, &c.)\n\n**Hooly Onore.**\u2014A town in the Mysore Rajah's territories, 122 miles N. W. from Serinapatam. Lat. 13\u00b0. 44'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 41'. E. The fort at this place is of a large square form, with towers at the angles, and two on each face; but it is not, on the whole, a strong place. The pettah is extensive, and tolerably well built, and inclosed by a bad wall and ditch. During the rains the River Buddra washes the western wall of the fort.\n\nIn 1792 Hooly Onore was taken by the British detachment under\nCapt. Little, and completely sacked and destroyed by the Maharattas, who got the plunder. Prior to the Maharatta invasion the adjacent country was remarkably well peopled and cultivated. A Maharatta officer describing it, said it was so thickly settled, that every evening when the army encamped they could count 10 villages in flames. (Moor, \u00a7c.)\n\nHoraforas.\u2014See Borneo.\n\nHorispoor, (Hurshapur, the Town of Joy).\u2014A town in the Seik territories, in the province of Lahore, 98 miles E. S. E. from the city of Lahore. Lat. 31\u00b0. 30'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 27'. E.\n\nHoseepoor.\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, district of Sarun, 82 miles N. W. from Patna. Lat. 26\u00b0. 25'. N. Long. 84\u00b0. 17'. E.\n\nHossein Abdaul.\u2014A town in the Afghan territories, in the province of Lahore, 30 miles E. by S. from Attock. Lat. 33\u00b0. N. Long. 71\u00b0. 43'. E.\n\nHossobetta.\u2014A small town on the sea coast of the province of North Canara. Lat. 12\u00b0. 42'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. E. Near to this place is a large straggling town, named Manjeswara, containing many good houses, chiefly inhabited by Moplays, Buntars, and Biluars. The principal inhabitants of Hossobetta, and of many other towns in Tulava, are Concemies, or people descended from natives of the Coucan. It is reported they fled hither to escape a persecution at Govay, (Goa) their native country, an order to convert them having arrived from Portugal. The rich immediately removed, and the poor, who remained behind, were converted to what was called Christianity. (F. Buchanan, \u00a7c.)\n\nHosso Durga.\u2014A small town in the province of South Canara. Lat. 12\u00b0. 16'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 13'. E. This place is inhabited by a few Putter Brahmins, who serve a temple, and whose ancestors were put there by the Ikeri Rajah, who built the fort. The latter is large, and well built of the laterite, common all over Malabar. The bastions being round it is more capable of defence than native forts are in general, in which the defences are usually of a square form.\n\nAt this place the dry field rises into gentle swells, but it is too hard for plantations. The inner parts of the country are very thinly inhabited, and much overgrown with wood; the surface, like the rest of Malabar, consisting of alternate low hills and narrow valleys. In cultivation more slaves are employed than free men. The district around Hosso Durga is called the country of the Neliswara Rajah. (F. Buchanan, \u00a7c.)\n\nHubely, (or Hoobly).\u2014A town in the province of Bejapoor, 17 miles S. E. from Darwar. Lat. 15\u00b0. 24'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 10'. E.\n\nHubely has for many years been a place of great trade, and still continues a populous and respectable town. The surrounding country is well wooded and watered, and an extensive inland traffic is carried on. There is also a considerable trade with the coast, principally through the medium of Goa; whence, in return for sandal wood and elephants' teeth, they receive raw silk, cottons, woollens, and rice. The two first are manufactured here, and sold to a large amount, chiefly for the dresses of the country people. The bankers are numerous and rich, and extend their commercial intercourse, by means of agents, as far north as Surat; eastward to Hyderabad; and southward to Serinapatanam. Bills of exchange can be negotiated on places still more distant, and the currency of the neighbouring country is in a great measure regulated by the Hubely bankers. There are no public or private buildings of note; and although there are two forts, they are neither capable of opposing any resistance to an army.\n\nNear to Hubely, and to many other towns in this part of India, the ruins of mosques and Mahommedan burying places prove that there were formerly a great many inhabitants of that religion; but they are now so\nreduced in number, that in twenty towns or villages scarcely one is to be found; and when there are a few they subsist on alms, in a miserable state of poverty, pride, and contempt.\n\nIn 1673 this place was sacked by the Maharatta chief, Sevajee, at which time the English factory here sustained a loss of 8000 pagodas. In 1685 it was again taken by Sultan Manzzum, Aurangzebe's son.\n\nIn 1804 Old Hubely was a possession of the Phurkiah Maharatta family; at which time, when General Wellesley was marching south after the campaign against Sindia, it was besieged by the sirousbah, or deputy of the Peshwa. The garrison in the fort, on hearing of Gen. Wellesley's arrival in their neighbourhood, requested his interference, and sent him a letter addressed to the deputy by the Peshwa, directing him to give Old Hoobly and its dependencies to Bapoo Phurkiah, his highness's brother-in-law, and the very person for whom the garrison already held it. On the other hand, the deputy produced the Peshwa's order, commanding him to besiege and take the place from Phurkiah, before which, although only a mud village, he had been employed six weeks. The general recommended to both parties to desist from hostilities, and to write to Poonah for an explanation of the Peshwa's real intentions respecting the plan, which was done accordingly.

E.\n\nHUMPAPURA.\u2014An open village in the Rajah of Mysore's territories, situated on the banks of the Kapini River, which in the rainy season is 60 yards wide, and at all seasons contains running water. Lat. 12\u00b0. 4'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 36'. E. The land watered by the rivers coming from the Western Ghauts is naturally the finest in Mysore, and would equal any in the world were it properly cultivated. Although within 30 miles of Seringapatam, the country around has always remained in a state of complete desolation. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nHURDA, (Harada).\u2014A town and small fort in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Khandesh, 9 miles S. S. W. from Hindia. Lat. 22\u00b0. 24'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 18'. E. The country around this place is generally open and tolerably well cultivated; but from Hurda to Charwah the land is covered with jungle and uninhabited.\n\nHURDWAR, (Haridwar, the Gate of Hari or Vishnu).\u2014A town and celebrated place of Hindoo pilgrimage in the province of Delhi, situated on the west side of the Ganges, where it issues from the northern hills. Lat. 29\u00b0. 57'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 2'. E; Hardwar, or Haradwara, is also called Gangadwara, (dwara means a gate or passage). In the Seanda and other Purans it is written Haridwara, which marks a different etymology from Hari(Vishnu), not from Hara(Mahadeva). The town of Hurdwar is very inconsiderable in itself, having only one street, about 15 feet in breadth, and one and a half furlongs in length. The Ganges, after forcing its way through an extensive tract of mountainous country, here first enters the plains. Great numbers are led hither as much from commercial as holy motives; and through this channel the principal places in the Doab, Delhi, and Lucknow, are supplied with the productions of the northern and western countries.\n\nThe principal articles brought hither for sale are horses, mules, camels, a species of tobacco, (called eaccar) antimony, asafotida, dried\nfruits, such as apricots, figs, prunes, raisins, almonds, pistachio nuts, and pomegranates, from Cabul, Candahar, Mooltan, and the Punjab; shawls, dootas, and pattoos, from Cashmere and Amritsar.\n\nSpotted turbans, looking-glasses, toys, with various manufactures in brass and ivory, from Jeypoor; shields from Rohilcund, Lucknow, and Silhet; bows and arrows from Mooltan and the Doab; rock salt from Lahore; baftas and piece goods from Rahn (a large city in the Punjab). The Marwar country supplies a great many camels, and a species of flannel called loi. From the Company's provinces are brought Kharwa muslins, mashroo, (or sarsnet) cocoa nuts, and woollen cloths. Of the latter a few bales are sent on the part of the Company; but the sale is very inconsiderable, and the coarsest only meet with a market. Here are also to be seen some Dutch and Venetian coins.\n\nThe northern merchants who visit the fair travel in large caravans, and the cattle brought for sale are used also for the conveyance of merchandise. The north-western caravans generally assemble at Amritsar about the end of February, and pursue the route through the Seik country. On the road they are much infested by freebooters, who frequently carry off stragglers. Those who come merely for bathing arrive in the morning; and, after performing their ablutions, depart in the evening, or on the following day. At the annual fairs it is supposed from two to 300,000 are collected; once in 12 years, when particular religious ceremonies are observed, the number is computed to be almost a million; in April, 1809, they were estimated at two millions. During the Maharatta sway a kind of poll-tax and duties on cattle were levied; but all now is free, without impost or molestation.\n\nThe horses and cattle are dispersed indiscriminately all over the fair, which is held in the bed of the river, which at this period is nearly dry. The most conspicuous persons are the Fakirs, of whom there are several sects; but the principal ones are the Gossains or Sunnyassies, the Bairagies, the Jogies, and the Udassies. These four sects are again subdivided and branched out to a great variety. The most numerous are the Gossains, who, during the Maharatta government, were sufficiently numerous to dispute the authority of the place, and not only collected duties on their own account, but regulated the police during the fair.\n\nThe next powerful sect was the Bairagies; but from the year 1760, until the Company obtained possession of the Doab, this caste was debarred from the pilgrimage. Although the sway of the Gossains be over, they still occupy the best stations at the fair. Many of these profess a total disregard for worldly concerns, and appear in a complete state of nature; but among them are many men of considerable property, who assume only the garments of the devotee, being in other respects well provided with the comforts and conveniences of life. Some of them follow the military profession, but the greater part are engaged in commercial or agricultural pursuits.\n\nThe Gossains or Sanyassies are the worshippers of Siva or Mahadeva, and are distinguished by a wrapper of cloth, dyed with red ochre. The term is a corruption of Goswami, lord of the bull, an appellation of Mahadeva's.\n\nThe Bairagies are disciples of Vishnu, and are distinguished by two perpendicular stripes of yellow ochre or sandal on the forehead, and a string of tulasi beads round the neck.\n\nThe Udassies are followers of Na-nock Shah, the founder of the Seik sect, and are known by a conical cap with a fringe.\n\nThe Jogies are votaries of Mahadeva, and have a longitudinal slit in the cartilage of the ear. Another\ncustom prevails among the Gosains and Jogies, which is uncommon among other Hindoos, that of burying their dead. All these castes engage in husbandry and commerce; but the profession of arms is peculiar to the Gosains or Sanyassies. Some of them never shave, but allow the hair on the head to grow to an enormous length, binding it round the forehead in small tresses like a turban.\n\nNo particular ceremony is observed in bathing, which consists merely in simple immersion. The depth at the proper season is only four feet, and both sexes plunge in indiscriminately. Those who are rigidly pious are introduced by a couple of Brahmans, who, having dipped the penitent in the holy stream, reconduct him to the shore. The period of ablution is that of the sun's entering Aries, which, according to a Hindoo computation, happens 20 days later than the vernal equinox. Every 12th year, when Jupiter is in Aquarius, at the time of the sun's entering Aries, the concourse of the people is greatly augmented.\n\nThe stream at Hurdwar divides itself into three channels, the principal of which is on the western side, running along a bank named Chandnee Ghaut. The points of the islands which are formed in the bed of the river are chiefly of loose pebbles and sand; but the rest of the land between the different channels is covered with the mimosa catechu. The hills in this vicinity are but thinly covered with vegetable productions, and the trees are few and small. About three miles below Hurdwar some natives have built five large houses of durable materials, for the accommodation of persons visiting these sacred places.\n\nAt the foot of the pass into the mountains is a Goorkhali post, belonging to Nepaul, to which slaves are brought down from the hills and exposed for sale. Many hundreds of these poor wretches, of both sexes, from three to 30 years of age, are brought down from all parts of the interior of the hills and sold; the prices being from 10 to 150 rupees. The average price of camels from Lahore is 75 rupees, and common horses from 250 to 300 rupees.\n\nThe merchants never mention *viva voce* the price of their cattle; but having thrown a cloth over their hands they conduct the bargain by touching the different joints of the fingers, to prevent the bystanders from gaining any information. Owing to the precautions taken by the British government the fairs have lately ended at Hurdwar without bloodshed, to the astonishment and satisfaction of the vast multitude, who were before accustomed to associate the idea of bloodshed and murder with that of the Hurdwar fair.\n\nTravelling distance from Calcutta by Moorshedabad, 1080 miles; by Birbhoom, 975 miles; from Delhi, 117 miles; and from Lucknow, 311 miles.

E. from the city of Delhi, much celebrated in the Hindu Mythological Poems, and founded by Rajah Hasti. Lat. 29\u00b0 7'. N. Long. 77\u00b0 56'. E. Hastinagara is about 20 miles S. W. from Dara-nagar, on a branch of the Ganges, formerly the bed of that river. There remains only a small place of worship. The extensive site of this ancient city is entirely covered with large ant hills, which has induced the inhabitants of the adjacent country to suppose that it had been overturned or destroyed by the termites. (Wilford, &c.)\n\nHuttany.\u2014A town in the Maharrata territories, in the province of Bejapoor, 20 miles E. from Mirjee. Lat. 16\u00b0 59'. N. Long. 75\u00b0 20'. E.\n\nThis place is large and populous, and has an extensive commerce with Bombay, Surat, Rachore, &c. The manufactures are silk and cotton sarrees, piece goods, &c. but their staple article is grain. The town is enclosed by a wall and ditch of no great strength, and there is a stone fort which scarcely deserves the name. Here is an excellent durrumsalla, or place of accommodation for travellers, from the appearance of which the importance of a town throughout the province of Bejapoor may generally be estimated. It is capable of lodging 500 persons, the horses and camels being picketed round the building, which is handsomely built of free stone.\n\nHuttany was a considerable place in 1679, when it was taken from Scrajee, who had reduced it, by the confederates from Bejapoor, who proposed to sell the inhabitants for slaves; but this measure was warmly opposed by Sambhajee, Sevajee's revolted son, who not being able to carry his point, became reconciled to his father. The English factory, at Carwar, about the middle of the 17th century, had considerable trafficking at Huttany; but, on account of its frequent revolutions, the intercourse was discontinued. (Moor, &c.)\n\nHYDERABAD.\n\nA large province in the Deccan, which communicates its name to the Nizam's dominions generally, and is situated between the 16th and 19th degrees of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by the Godaverry; and to the south by the River Krishna; to the east it has the Hindoo province of Gundwana; and to the west Beeder and Anrungabad. In length it may be estimated at 180 miles, by 150 the average breadth. This territory composed a considerable portion of ancient Telengana, which, in the Institutes of Acber, is called a district of Berar, but was probably only in part possessed by that emperor.\n\nThe surface of this province is hilly, but not mountainous, and is an elevated table land; the consequence of which is a greater degree of cold, than its latitude would indicate. At Hyderabad, and the provinces to the north of it, the thermometer during three months of the year is often so low as 45\u00b0, 40\u00b0, and 35\u00b0. of Fahrenheit. To protect themselves against this degree of cold, the lower classes use a coarse woollen blanket made in the country, and the higher classes shawls and quilted silks. A few of the noblemen and chief military clothe themselves in broad cloth as a fashion or luxury, but the mode is not general. The Nizam's cavalry clothe themselves according to their own taste. The regular infantry, amounting to from 12 to 15,000, are dressed in British red cloth, and are equipped with accoutrements, made either at Madras or Masulipatam.\n\nA great part of the Nizam's dominions is occupied by Jaghireddars, who are of two descriptions, viz. the\nHindoo Jaghireddars and zemindars, such as the Rajah of Sholapoor, whose ancestors possessed their estates almost from the first sovereigns of the Deccan, and over whom the Nizam exercises a very uncertain and undefined authority. The other description of Jaghireddars are the military officers in the service of the Nizam, in number from 40 to 50. Almost the whole country, with the exception of land set apart for religious purposes, the crown lands and small parts, held by old Hindoo zemindars, is under the management of some description of Jaghireddar. Since the introduction of red cloth among the Nizam's troops, the principal Jaghireddars have adopted the same mode of clothing for their forces, amounting to seven or 8000 men.\n\nThis province is fertile, and, on the whole, tolerably well watered; but, from the nature of the government, it has never attained any great prosperity; the cultivators being wretchedly poor, and much oppressed by their Mahommedan superiors, who are subject to little restraint from their nominal sovereign. From the same cause they are almost deprived of the benefits of commerce, the average import of European goods into the Nizam's extensive dominions, prior to 1809, not exceeding 25,000l. sterling per annum. The principal trade carried on between the Nizam's territories and the British, is the supply of cotton sent from Berar to the Northern Circars; and also to the markets at Vellore, Arnee, and the vicinity. The traders return with cargoes of salt and salt fish, some cloths manufactured in the Northern Circars, and some Arnee muslins.\n\nThe principal towns in this province are Hyderabad, Golcondah, Warangol, Meduck, and Nilcundah. The country taken generally is but thinly inhabited, and indifferently cultivated, and cannot compete with any of the Company's most flourishing districts. This being one of the few remaining Mogul governments, a greater proportion of Mahommedans are to be found among the upper and middling classes of the inhabitants, than in any of the contiguous regions; but the great mass of the lower classes are still Hindoos, in the proportion probably of above 10 to one. Compared with other districts the population of which has been ascertained, the number of inhabitants of the Hyderabad province may be estimated not to exceed two and a half millions.\n\nWhile Telengana existed as an independent Hindoo sovereignty, it comprehended most of the tract lying between the Krishna and Godavery rivers, the capital of which was Warangol. At an early period it was invaded and partly conquered by the Mahommedans, and afterwards formed part of the great Bhamene empire of the Deccan. On the dissolution of this state, Telengana became again the seat of an independent government under the name of Golcondah, the first sovereign being Kooli Kuttab Shah, who established the Kuttab Shahy dynasty of Golcondah. He began to reign in 1512, and was assassinated in 1551.\n\nJumshood Kuttab Shah died A.D. 1558.\n\nIbrahim Kuttab Shah died A.D. 1561.\n\nKorli Kuttab Shah died 1586. This prince founded the city of Hyderabad, and, having no son, was succeeded by his brother Mahommed. The successor to this prince was Abdullah Kuttab Shah, who became tributary to the Mogul Emperor Shah Jehan; and in this state the kingdom remained until 1690, when Golcondah was taken by Aurangzebe, and Abou Houssein, the reigning sovereign, made prisoner, and confined for life in the fortress of Dowletabad, where he died in 1704.\n\nOn the destruction of the Mogul empire, after the death of Aurangzebe, Nizam ul Mookh obtained possession of the Mahommedan con-\nquests in the Deccan about the year 1717. He died the 24th March, 1748, aged (it is said) 104 years, and left six sons, viz. Ghazi ul Deen, Nasir Jung, Salabut Jung, Nizam Ali, Bassalut Jung, and Moghul Ali.\n\nNasir Jung being present at Boorhanpoor when his father died succeeded, and was assassinated in 1750.\n\nMuzaffar Jung (a grandson of Nizam ul Mook\u2019s) was placed on the throne, and assassinated in 1751.\n\nSalabut Jung, by the influence of the French, was then proclaimed, and reigned until 1761, when he was imprisoned; and, in 1763, put to death by his brother Nizam Ali, who ascended the throne, and reigned until the 6th August, 1803, when he died, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Mirza Secunder Jah, who now reigns.\n\nSince the decease of Nizam ul Mook, the limits of this state have experienced much fluctuation, but it was always on the decline, and would have been totally annihilated by the Maharattas, but for the support afforded by the British government. On the 12th Oct. 1800, a treaty of perpetual alliance was entered into with the Nizam, by Major Kirkpatrick on the part of the British; by the conditions of which the enemies of the one were to be considered in the same relation to the other.\n\nBy this arrangement the British force to be stationed in the Nizam\u2019s territories was augmented to 8000 regular infantry, and 1000 regular cavalry, with their regular complement of guns, European artillery-men, and equipment of warlike stores. For the regular payment of these forces the Nizam ceded to the British all the territories he had acquired under the treaty of Seringapatam in 1792, and also under the treaty of Mysore in 1799. Certain of the countries ceded by this article being inconvenient for their situation to the north of the Toombuddra, for the purpose of rendering the boundary well defined, it was determined that his highness the Nizam should retain Kopaul, Gujunderghur, and other districts to the north of the Toombuddra; and in lieu thereof assign Adoni, and whatever territory to the south of that river, or to the south of the Krishna below its junction with the Toombuddra, the estimated value of the whole being about 72 lacks of rupees per annum. It was agreed that all claims of every description on the Nizam should cease on possession being obtained of the ceded districts, from which date also all demands on account of the subsidiary force were to terminate, which in future was to be wholly supported and paid by the British.\n\nIn the event of a war taking place the Nizam engaged to join the British forces with 6000 infantry, and 9000 horse of his own troops, with the necessary train of artillery and stores. By this treaty also it was arranged that all the external political relations of the two states should be exclusively managed by the British, who undertook to protect his highness\u2019s dominions from all external annoyance and internal insurrection, and to procure a total exemption from all claims of Choute on the part of the Maharattas. By a supplementary article in January, 1804, it was agreed, that during a joint war all forts in the Hyderabad dominions were to be open to the British.\n\nOn the 12th April, 1802, a commercial treaty was negociated with the Nizam, by which the British granted him the free use of the port of Masulipatam, with liberty there to establish a factory, and they also engaged to protect his highness\u2019s flag on the high seas. It was agreed that a free transit of goods should be permitted, and all local duties abolished, in lieu of which five per cent. to be levied on all articles indiscriminately imported into the respective territories of each, no article on\nany account to pay duty more than once. A duty of five per cent. and no more, to be levied on the prime cost of all articles purchased in the Hyderabad states for exportation, and such articles not to be resold there. The commerce of grain to be under particular regulations.\n\nOn the 28th April, 1804, after the war with Dowlet Row Sindia and the Rajah of Nagpoor, a partition treaty was concluded; by the conditions of which the Nagpoor Rajah ceded to the Nizam all the country, of which he collected the revenue in conjunction with the Nizam, and fixed the Nagpoor frontier towards the west at the River Wurda, from whence it issues from the Injardy Hills, to its junction with the Godavery. The hills on which the forts of Nernallah and Gawelghur stand, with a district contiguous to the amount of four lacks of rupees revenue, to remain with the Nagpoor Rajah; but everything else south of the Injardy Hills, and west of the Wurda, to be ceded to the Nizam.\n\nAll the territories belonging to Dowlet Row Sindia before the commencement of the war of 1803, situated to the south of the Adjuntee Hills, including the fort and district of Jalnapoor, the town and district of Gandapoor, and all the other districts between that range of hills and the River Godavery, ceded by Sindia to the British, by this treaty were transferred in perpetual sovereignty to the Nizam. The Hyderabad sovereignty, in consequence, acquired a great increase of territory, and obtained, for the first time, a compact and well defined boundary.\n\nAt present the Nizam's dominions occupy the centre of the Deccan, comprehending the greater part of Berar, the whole of Hyderabad, Nandere, and Beeder, and part of Aurungabad and Bejapoor. Towards the Nagpoor territories their limits are marked by the course of the Wurda River, and on the side of the British by the Krishna and Toom-\n\nbuddra. In length it may be estimated at 420 miles, by 220 the average breadth, containing a population of about 8,000,000 of inhabitants. (Sydenham, Treaties, Ferishta, Orme, Malcolm, J. Grant, Rennel, &c. &c.)\n\nHyderabad.\u2014A city in the province of Hyderabad, of which it is the capital, and of the Nizam's dominions. Lat. 17\u00b0. 15'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 42'. E.\n\nHyderabad, or Baugnagur, stands on the south side of the Musah River, which runs very rapidly in the rains, but in the dry season has scarcely two feet of water. It is surrounded by a stone wall, which is no defence against artillery, but which served for protection against the incursions of cavalry. Within the wall the city is about four miles in length, by three in breadth. It contains a considerable number of mosques, this having long been the principal Mahomedan station in the Deccan. About six miles to the W. N. W. is the celebrated fortress of Golconda, occupying the summit of a conical hill, and by the natives deemed impregnable.\n\nHyderabad being one of the few remaining Mogul governments, more of the old forms and ceremonies of that great dynasty are retained at the Nizam's court, than at any other in Hindostan. Some of the higher and wealthier Mahomedans use a few articles of European manufacture in their dress, and in the furniture of their houses, but this has occurred principally among the ministers of the Nizam. These articles consist chiefly of glass ware, china, lustres, chintz coverings for sofas, and some articles of plate after the European fashion. The noblemen at Hyderabad have been either bred up as soldiers or courtiers, and expend their fortunes in keeping up as large a retinue of servants and dependents as their wealth will allow, or they consume their property in the profligacy and corruption of the court where they reside.\nIn the city of Hyderabad the Nizam possesses large magazines, in which are deposited the presents received at various times from the different native and European powers. The rooms are filled from the floor near to the ceiling with bales of woollens, cases of glass, glass ware, china ware, clocks, watches, and other articles of European manufacture. These articles have been received as presents by the reigning Nizam, his father, and grandfather, some so far back as the time of Duplex and Bussy. They have ever since continued locked up in the magazines, where they are likely to remain.\n\nHyderabad (formerly Bangnagur) was founded about the year 1585, by Mahommed Kooli Kuttab Shah. It was taken and plundered by the Mogul armies of Aurengzebe, A.D. 1687, the principal inhabitants having retired to the neighbouring fortress of Golconda. The late Nizam Ali transferred the royal residence from Aurungabad, which had hitherto been the capital, to this place; the former, from the fluctuation of his territories, being latterly placed in a corner of his dominions, and too near the Maharatta frontier.\n\nHyderabad has never since experienced any external molestation; and, being the residence of the court, has rapidly increased in wealth and population. At present the number of inhabitants may be estimated at 120,000, including the suburbs.\n\nTravelling distance from Calcutta, by the Northern Circars, 902; by Nagpoor, 1043 miles; from Madras, 352; from Bombay, 480; from Delhi, 923; from Nagpoor, 321; from Poonah, 387; from Seriapatan, 406 miles. (Sydenham, Upton, Rennef, Ferishta, Scott, &c. &c.)\n\nHyderabad.\u2014A city in the province of Sindc, of which it is the capital. Lat. 23\u00b0 22'. N. Long. 68\u00b0 41'. E.\n\nThe fortress of Hyderabad stands on a rocky hill, the foot of which is washed by a branch of the Indus named the Fulalce. It is of an irregular pentagonal figure, built to suit the shape of the mass of rock on which it stands, defended by round towers, and a high brick wall perforated with loop holes. In many places the sides of the hill are so steep, that the ascent to the fortress would be difficult, even were it breached to the foundation. The weakest part of the fort is towards the S.E. opposite a break in the rock from the fulalce. The northern side of the fort has a dry ditch cut in the rock, but not above 12 feet broad. The walls have loop holes for matchlocks, but the artillery is placed so high as to be useless against an enemy very near the fort. Its natural situation is strong, and the whole is capable of effectually resisting every native attack, but would present a feeble opposition to European assailants. There are several handsome mosques within the fort, but no building's worth notice in its vicinity, except Gholam Shah's (the founder of the city) tomb, on a hill to the south of the fort. The shops in the bazar are kept well supplied, and are mostly tenanted by Hindoo Banyans. Although no encouragement is given to industry by the Ameeers, the artisans are numerous and skillful, particularly the armourers, who are noted for the excellence of their workmanship, and the artificers who embroider on leather.\n\nThe grand branch of the Indus does not approach Hyderabad nearer than two three-fourths or three miles. Boats laden with heavy goods, to avoid the inconvenience of land carriage, enter the Fulalce branch of the Indus about 13 miles to the southward of Hyderabad, on the east side of the main river. The route from Tatta up the Fulalce to Hyderabad is the longest, as it winds far to the eastward, and then curves to the N.W., running past the hill on which Hyderabad stands, forming an island named Gunagah. The Fulalce in the month of August is here\nfrom two and a half to three fathoms in depth.\n\nThe soil in the vicinity of Hyderabad is of a light sandy colour, and very productive when properly cultivated. Two miles and a half to the southward of Hyderabad is a table land, extending about two miles, and 12 miles to the southward are a range of rocky hills, part of which approaches the Falacee, and are called the Gungah Hills. Three miles W. by S. is a village on the eastern bank of the Indus, from which boats are continually crossing with passengers to Cotric on the opposite side, which is on the route from Tatta to Hyderabad.\n\nThis city is the residence of the Ameeurs, or present sovereigns of Sind, yet the revenue only amounts to the trifling sum of 60,000 rupees per annum, and the population to about 15,000. There is no standing army kept at Hyderabad, each Ameer retaining a few troops which serve in time of peace to garrison the fort.

Near to Ikery, on the southern bank of the Varada, which is here a small stream, stands a well-built town named Saggar, which carries on a considerable trade.\n\nDuring the time that Ikery was the residence of the princes descended from Sadasiva, it was a very large place, and by the natives it is said, with their usual exaggeration, to have contained 100,000 houses. Like Soonda, its walls are of very considerable extent, and form three concentric enclosures rather than fortifications. No town at present remains here, but the devastation was not occasioned by any calamity; the court having removed from hence to Bednore, the people soon followed. Ikery continued the nominal capital, the Rajahs were called by its name, and the coins were supposed to be struck there, although in fact the mint was removed. The pagodas struck since the conquest at Mysore and Bednore are still denominated Ikery pagodas. The country from hence to Ghenaser Guli is so barren, that it does not even answer the purposes of pasture. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nInaconda.\u2014A town in the Carnatic district of Palnaud, 44 miles N. N. W. from Ongole. Lat. 16\u00b0. 1'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 34'. E. This was formerly a fortified hill in the old Indian style of considerable strength.\n\nINDIA BEYOND THE GANGES.\n\nThis expression is generally used to designate the countries to the east of Bengal, but it is not strictly correct, a considerable part of that province extending to the east of the Ganges. It is also sometimes termed a peninsula, which its shape in no manner justifies. In the modern acceptation of the phrase which was first applied by the Greeks, this re-\nregion comprehends Ava, Aracan, Cassay, Caehar, Pegu, Tongho, Martaban, Juukseylon, Tavay, Tenasserim, Lowashan, Yunshan, and all the other districts really or nominally subordinate to the Birman empire. In addition to these it includes Siam, Malacca, Cambodia, Siampa, Laos, Laetho, Cochin China, Tungquin, and several unexplored tracts of country.\n\nTo the north it is bounded by Assam, Tibet, and China; on the N. E. by China, and on the N. W. by Bengal and Assam; all the rest of its extent is washed by the ocean. Making an allowance for the peninsula of Malacca, in length it may be estimated at 1300 miles, by 600 the average breadth.\n\nThe inhabitants of this extensive region may be distinguished into three divisions; those who possess the eastern part, those who possess the western, and those who hold the southern extremity. The people who inhabit the eastern quarter show a great affinity with the Chinese their neighbours, and in like manner those on the western, in many important particulars, approximate to the Hindoos. The southern extremity is possessed principally by the Malays. The nations comprehended in this space may be considered as a kind of body politic, wholly distinct from Hindostan, and connected together by a general similarity of manners, religion, and political maxims; their general dispositions being strikingly contrasted with that of the natives of India west of the Ganges. With the exception of the Malays, and some rude tribes of mountaineers, the natives of this region profess only one religion, and adhere solely to the system of Buddha, which in its grand features identifies itself with that which prevails in Nepaul, Bootan, Tibet, and has extended itself over the vast countries of Chin, Cham, and Japan, or China, Tartary, and Japan. In respect to their numbers the followers of Buddha have probably attained a greater dominion than those of any other religious persuasion.\n\nAlthough but trifling in Hindostan, (his native country) his doctrines extend over China, its tributary nations, and many Tartar hordes to Russia. India east of the Ganges, Great and Little Tibet, Bootan, Ceylon, and many of the islands in the Eastern Seas, whose inhabitants have not yet become Mahommedans, adhere to the religion of Buddha under various modifications.\n\nThe vernacular Indo Chinese languages on the continent seem all to be in their original structure, either purely monosyllabic, like the spoken languages of China, or incline greatly to this class, and are prodigiously varied in accentuation. The Pali language among the Indo Chinese nations occupies the same place which Sanscrit holds among the Hindoos, or Arabic among the followers of Mahommed. Throughout the greater part of the maritime countries which lie between India and China, it is the language of religion, law, literature, and science, and has had an extensive influence in modifying the vernacular languages of these regions. The name of this language, though commonly pronounced Bali, is more generally written Pali. Among the Indo Chinese nations the Bali is frequently denominated Lunka-basa, and Magata or Mungata.\n\nThe Bali alphabet seems in its origin to be a derivative from the Devanagari, though it has not only acquired a considerable difference of form, but has also been modified to a certain degree, in the power of the letters, by the monosyllabic pronunciation of the Indo Chinese nations. The form of the Bali character varies essentially among the different nations by whom it is used; the Bali language is an ancient dialect of Sanscrit, which sometimes approaches very near the original.\n\nFor particular descriptions see the different kingdoms and provinces\nrespectively.

E.\n\nIndore.\u2014A town in the province of Malwah, the capital of the Holcar family, situated about 30 miles S. E. from Oojain. Lat. 22\u00b0. 51'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 10'. E.\n\nMulhar Row Holcar, the founder of this family, rose to eminence under the first Peshwa, when he received in marriage the daughter of Narayon Row Bund, the maternal uncle of Sahoo Rajah. He obtained high commands under Balajee Row and Bajerow, and escaped from the battle of Paniput. His own son, Candi Row, and grand-daughter, Ahili Bhai, both died in his own life-time. His wife, Gautama Bhai, adopted a nephew, Tukojee Holcar, who succeeded to the territories of Mulhar Row. On the death of Tukojee Holcar, in 1797, he left four sons; two legitimate, Casi Row and Mullar Row; and two illegitimate, Wetul Row and Jeswunt Row Holcar. Dissensions arising among them, most of their possessions were seized on by Dowlet Row Sindia, after putting to death Mulhar Row; the remainder were usurped by Jeswunt Row Holcar, to the prejudice of the legal heir, Casi Row Holcar.\n\nDuring the war which ensued between the British and Jeswunt Row Holcar, Indore was captured by the Bombay army in 1804. The last campaign of this usurper was only a flight before the British army, which pursued him as far as the banks of the Bejah, to Lahore, where, being reduced to extreme distress, he sent agents to Lord Lake to solicit a peace.\n\nA treaty was in consequence arranged with him by Colonel Malcolm on the part of the British government, by the conditions of which Holcar renounced all claim on Tonk Rampoorah, Boondee, Lakherece, Sameydee, Bhamingaum, Dare, and other places north of the Boondee Hills; and the Company engaged to have no concern with the ancient possessions of the Holcar family in Mewar, Malwah, and Harowty, or with any of the rajahs situated south of the Chumbul.\n\nThe British government also agreed to deliver over such of the ancient possessions of the Holcar family in the Deccan, situated south of the River Tuptec, with the exception of the fort and pergunnah of Chandere, the pergunnahs of Ambar and Sengham, and the villages and pergunnahs situated to the south of the Godavery. These were retained as surety for the good conduct of Holcar, which, if such as to satisfy the British government, it engaged, at the expiration of 18 months from the date of the treaty, to restore to the Holcar family the fort and district of Chandore, the pergunnahs of Ambar and Sengham, and the districts situated to the south of the Godavery.\n\nJeswunt Row Holcar by this treaty relinquished all claim to the district of Koonch, in Bundelcund; but the British government engaged, if his conduct proved satisfactory, to bestow that district, as a jaghire, on his daughter, Bheemah Bhyc, and Holcar agreed not to entertain Europeans of any description in his service without the consent of the British government. On the 2d of February, 1806, by a declaratory article, Tonk Rampoorah, and other districts to the north of the Boondee Hills, were also restored to him; so that at the conclusion, although one of the bitterest enemies of the British, his loss was trifling, compared with some others. Since that pe-\nperiod he has been subject to frequent fits of insanity, which have reduced him to total insignificance.\n\nTravelling distance from Bombay, 456 miles; from Nagpoor, 371; and from Calcutta, 1030 miles. (Treaties, Marquis Wellesley, Malcolm, Brough- ton, &c.)\n\nIndrapoor, (Indrapur).\u2014A district on the S.W. coast of the Island of Sumatra, situated principally between the second and third degrees of south latitude, and the town of Indrapoor about 100 miles N.W. from Bengoolen. The river of Indrapoor, which descends from the mountains of Korinchi, is considered as one of the largest in the southern part of the west coast of Sumatra, and is capable of admitting sloops. This country formerly produced a large quantity of pepper, and some gold was brought from the interior, which now finds another channel. An English factory was established here in 1684, but never became of any importance.\n\nThe Indrapoor principality was early dismembered from the Menan-cabow empire, and long flourished as an independent state. In 1682 the district of Ayer Aji threw off its dependence on Indrapoor. In 1696 Rajah Pasisici Barat, by the influence of the Dutch, was placed on the throne; but, in consequence of a quarrel with his protectors, the European settlers were massacred. This occasioned a destructive war, in the event of which the rajah was obliged to fly, and the country nearly depopulated. In 1705 he was re-instated, and reigned until about 1732; but the kingdom never recovered the shock, and dwindled into the obscurity in which it still continues. (Marsden, &c.)\n\nIndus River, (Sindhi).\u2014The source of this river has never been explored, and still remains a matter of conjecture. The natives of Hindostan assign it a very remote origin in the mountains, four or five days' journey to the north-west of Yar-gund, which would place it about Lat. 44\u00b0. N. Long. 70\u00b0. E. near the city of Cashgar, in Chinese Tartary. From hence they assert it takes a southerly direction, coming within two days' journey of Lahdack, whence, turning to the west, it takes an immense sweep towards Saighur (probably the Shekerdou of the maps), and then proceeds in a direct course to the south. Part of this track, however, is not reconcileable with the easterly position of Lahdack, and the natives, in general, are prone to assign a remote source to all their rivers.\n\nAn excellent judge (Mr. Colebrooke) thinks it possible the Indus may originate on the western side of the great Himalaya ridge of mountains, after it takes a sweep to the north; it being probable, that the whole province of Lahdack, elevated and rugged as it is, declines from its southern limits both to the north and west. On the other hand the natives of India assert, that merchants travelling from Hindostan to Yarchard, in Little Bucharia (Bokhara), rendezvous at Lahdack, from whence they proceed in a body, travelling the greatest part of the way along the Indus. Its source appears to have been equally unknown to Abul Fazel, who, in 1582, describes it as follows:\n\n\"The Sinde, according to some, rises between Cashmere and Cashgar, whilst others place its source in Khatai. This river runs through the borders of Sewad, Attock, Benares, Chowpareh, and the territory of the Balooches.\" From this description, it appears he considered the north-east branch as the true Indus.\n\nThis river enters Hindostan about latitude 33\u00b0. 15'. N. where the Attock, or Kabul River, joins it from the west, and adds considerably to its bulk; for, although the Indus is sometimes fordable above Attock, it is not so below that point, where it is three-fourths of a mile in breadth in the month of July. From hence to the commencement of the Delta...\nits course is S. by W. with fewer windings than any river in India.\n\nAs it proceeds along the frontier of Afghanistan, it receives all the principal streams of that region, proving its general declination to the east; but this accession of waters adds more to its depth than expansion, as from Calabaugh northwards it is a clear deep stream, flowing between two ridges of rocks, through a channel, in many places not more than 300 yards broad. In this space its banks afford salt and alum in extraordinary abundance.\n\nIn the province of Mooltan it receives all the combined rivers of Lahore, or the Punjab, which increase it greatly both in depth and breadth, there being water sufficient for vessels of near 200 tons burthen from the Gulf of Cutch to Lahore, a distance of 760 geographical miles. In the time of Aurengzebe an extensive trade was carried on between these places, but at present little exists, owing to the rapacious governments and desolate state of the provinces. In the passage down boats from Lahore occupied only 12 days. Of the five rivers which give the name to the Punjab, the Indus is not considered as one, being rather the trunk or stock into which the Kabul and Lahore streams flow.\n\nAbout 170 miles from the sea, by the course of the river, the Indus divides into two branches, of which the westernmost is the largest. This branch, after proceeding about 50 miles to the S. W. divides into two more, and as it approaches the sea is again subdivided into several other branches and creeks, like the Sunderbunds, or Delta of the Ganges. Unlike the latter, however, it has no trees, the dry parts being covered with brush wood; and the remainder, by much the greater part, being arid sand, noisome swamps, or muddy lakes. It is a remarkable circumstance, that the tides are not visible in the Indus at a greater distance than 60 or 65 miles from the sea. At the mouths of the different branches, the bore, or sudden influx of the tide, is high and dangerous, and the velocity of its current has been estimated at four miles per hour, but this must vary greatly at different places.\n\nFrom the sea up to Hyderabad the Indus is, in general, about a mile in breadth, varying in depth from two to five fathoms. The swelling of the river, occasioned by the melting of the snow, generally commences the middle of July, and continues to increase until the end of August.\n\nThe Indus is called the Sindhu, or Sindhus in sanscrit, and Aub Sinde, or the Water of Sinde by the Persians. From Attock, downwards to Moulton, this river has obtained the name of Attock, and farther down that of Soor or Shoor, until it separates in the Delta; but it is generally known to Asiatics by the name of the Sinde. From Attock to the sea, a distance of near 900 miles, it forms a distinct and strong barrier to Hindostan, which has never yet been passed by any of the invading armies. Granting, as the natives suppose, that it originates to the N. W. of Cashgar, the extent of its course, including the windings, may be estimated at 1700 miles; but its source is probably much less remote.\n\nIn Hindostan there are four rivers, which were once much dreaded by religious people, viz.\u2014It was forbidden even to touch the waters of the Caramassa, to bathe in the Caratoya (a river in Bengal, called Curvatya in the maps), to swim in the Gunduck, and to cross the Attock. The prohibition, however, may be avoided by crossing the Indus above its confluence with the Attock. In Akbar's reign a body of Rajpoots, with their attendant Brahmans, crossed the Indus, to chastise some refractory Patan tribes; and the Brahmans who live in Afghanistan cross it daily without any scruple. There are other Brahmans and Hindoos, of all denominations,\nwho cross the Indus to visit the holy places in the west; but these persons have renounced the world, and retain but few practices of their classes. Though highly respected, yet nobody presumes to eat or communicate with them; but they go in crowds to receive their blessing.

E.\n\nIrawaddy, (Iravati).\u2014A great river in the Burman empire, the source of which has never been explored, but is supposed to be in the eastern quarter of Tibet. The course of this river is nearly north and south, and it is to the Ava dominions what the Ganges is to Bengal; at once a source of fertilization and of inland navigation, connecting the different provinces from the frontiers of Tibet and China to the sea.\n\nThe swelling of the Irawaddy is not influenced by the quantity of rain that falls in the low countries; but, by the heavy showers in the mountainous part of its track. Whilst the drought in the campaign district is very great, the river rises to its usual height; the part of the country near the city of Ava being rarely refreshed by copious rains; but, like Egypt, depends on the overflowing of its river for a supply of moisture. In the months of June, July, and August, the river, which in the hot and dry season winds slowly over its sandy bed, a slow and sluggish stream, swells over its banks and inundates the adjacent country. The current is very impetuous, but is counteracted by the strength of the south-west monsoon. During the monsoon months it rises and subsides several times.\n\nNotwithstanding the general name of the river is Irrawaddy, yet different parts of it are distinguished by different names, taken from places of note on its banks. The term is wholly Hindoo, being the name of Indra's elephant. At Ummerapoora even in the dry season, the principal branch of the Irawaddy is a mile broad. Its waters possess the quality of petrifying wood, in a very high degree.\n\nFrom Dr. Francis Buchanan's Geographical Researches while in Ava, it appears, that the river coming from Tibet, which was supposed to be that of Aracan, is in fact the Keendnem, or great western branch of the Irawaddy; and that what was supposed to be the western branch, is in fact the eastern one, which passes by Ava and runs to the south, keeping west from the province of Yunyan in China.

This is a large town situated on the north side of the Jhylurn, which here penetrates through the narrow openings of the mountains, and has a wooden bridge about 80 yards across. (Foster, &c.)\n\nIslamnagur.\u2014A town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Malwah, 5 miles N. E. from Borsal. Lat. 23\u00b0. 19'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 31'. E.\n\nIsmah.\u2014A small district in Northern Hindostan, situated to the south of the great Himalaya ridge of mountains, between the 29th and 30th degrees of north latitude. It is known to be tributary to the Ghoorkhali Rajah of Nepaul, but the interior has been but little explored.\n\nIssurdoo, (Isvarada).\u2014A town in the Rajpoot territories, in the province of Ajmeer. Lat. 26\u00b0. 20'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 10'. E. This place belongs to a branch of the Jyengur family, is surrounded with a wall and ditch, and has a citadel in the centre. It is one of the best built towns in the province. (Broughton, &c.)\n\nItchapoore.\u2014A town in the Northern Circars, 30 miles S. W. from Ganjam. Lat. 19\u00b0. 8'. N. Long. 35\u00b0. E.\n\nby the Dutch East India Company, in 1619, they have ever since possessed it by right of conquest. Before this revolution Jacatra was the capital, but has been superseded by Batavia, which was built very near the former, by the Governor General, John Pietersen Coen, immediately after the conquest.\n\nThe district of Jacatra is watered and fertilized by several rivers, most of which are little better than large rivulets in the dry season. The productions are principally coffee, sugar, and rice; but the inhabitants also raise indigo, cotton, turmeric, ginger, and cadjang, a species of dolichos, from which oil is produced. The ancient name of this district was Sunda Kalapa, from whence the straits derived their name. (Stavirius, &c.)\n\nJacotta, (Jayacata).\u2014A small town on the sea coast of the province of Cochin. Lat. 10\u00b0. 14'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 1'. E. This is a fortified town, with a very ancient harbour, where according to tradition St. Thomas landed.\n\nJactall.\u2014A town belonging to Nizam, in the province of Hyderabad, district of Dewarzundah. Lat. 18\u00b0. 48'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 32'. E.\n\nJaffierabad, (Jafarabad).\u2014A town in the Nizam's territories, in the province of Berar, 24 miles N. from Jalnapoor. Lat. 20\u00b0. 17'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 36'. E.\n\nJaffiergur.\u2014A town in the Nizam's territories, in the province of Hyderabad, 25 miles E. from Warangol. Lat. 17\u00b0. 52'. Long. 79\u00b0. 25'. E.\n\nJafnapanam.\u2014A district in the northern extremity of the Island of Ceylon, directly opposite to Negapatam in the Southern Carnatic, and considered as the most healthy in the island. This division consists of an oblong peninsula, almost cut off from the rest by a branch of the sea, which penetrates nearly across the island. From its maritime situation it escapes the intensely hot winds which prevail on the conti-\nFruits, vegetables, game, and poultry abound in this district, and it is only in the tract that lies between Point Pedro and Jafna that sheep have ever been raised with success.\n\nThe articles for foreign commerce produced here are of no great value; for although it affords some cinnamon and pepper, they are of an inferior kind. Dependent on the district of Jafna, and at a small distance to sea, are several islands of no great size, which the Dutch have named from their native cities, Delft, Harlem, Leyden, and Amsterdam. In these islands they breed horses and cattle, as from their excellent pasture they are better adapted for this purpose than any part of the main land. The same system is continued by the English government. The horses are bred under the superintendence of particular officers, and when of a proper age are disposed of by government.\n\nThe woods towards the interior, which separate this district from the Candian dominions, are inhabited by an extraordinary race of savages, supposed to be the original inhabitants of the country, known by the name of Bedahs or Vaddahs. (Percival, &c.)\n\nJAFNA.\u2014A town in the Island of Ceylon, the capital of a district of the same name. Lat. 9\u00b0. 45'. N. Long. 80\u00b0. 9'. E.\n\nThe fort and town of Jafna stand at some distance from the sea, but there is a communication by means of a river navigable for boats, which falls into the sea near Point Pedro. The fort of Jafna is small, but exceedingly well built; it was, however, given up to the British troops in 1795 without resistance. The Pettah, or black town, is larger and more populous than that of Trincomalee.\n\nOn account of its salubrity and cheapness many Dutch families have removed to Jafna from Columbo. The greater part of the inhabitants are of Mahommedan extraction, and are divided into several tribes, known by the names of Lubbahs, Moplays, Chittees, and Cholias; these foreign settlers greatly exceeding the native Ceylonese in the district of Jafna. Coarse cloths, calicoes, handkerchiefs, shawls, stockings, &c. are manufactured from cotton, the growth of the island. Here are also many artificers, such as goldsmiths, jewelers, joiners, and makers of all sorts of household furniture. (Percival, &c.)\n\nJAFRABAT, (Jafarabad).\u2014A town situated on the sea-coast of the Gujrat Peninsula, on the banks of a shallow river, and formerly a place of considerable commerce. Lat. 20\u00b0. 53'. N. Long. 71\u00b0. 31'. E. It is at present possessed by native independent chiefs.\n\nJAGEPOOR, (or Jehazpoor).\u2014A town in the province of Cuttack, 36 miles N. N. E. from the town of Cuttack, situated on the south side of the Byturnee River, which is here nearly half a mile broad. Lat. 20\u00b0. 50'. E. Long. 86\u00b0. 35'. E.\n\nThis is a large straggling town, in which a good deal of cloth is made. During the Mogul government it was a place of some consequence, and the remains of several Mahommedan edifices are still visible. The mosque here was built by Abou Hassir Khan, who, in an inscription, is very extravagant in the praises of his own mosque, although it is remarkably ill proportioned, having a large dome and small pillars. The country around is much intersected with small rivers.\n\nThe principality of Jagepoor in Orissa was invaded by Toghan Khan, the Mahommedan governor of Bengal, in A.D. 1243, at which period it appears to have been a state of some importance, as the rajah not only defeated Toghan Khan, but pursued him into Bengal, where he besieged Gour, the metropolis. The approach of reinforcements from Oude compelled him subsequently to retreat. The Mahommedans were again totally defeated by the Rajah of\nJagpoor in 1253. There is no record at what time this place fell finally under the domination of the Mahommedans, who possessed it until expelled by the Maharattas. (Leckie, Stewart, Upton, &c.)\n\nJaghireh, (Jaghir).\u2014A town in the Rajpoot territories, in the province of Ajmeer, 65 miles N. N. W. from the city of Ajmeer. Lat. 27\u00b0. 21'. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 12'. E.\n\nJaghire.\u2014A district in the Carnatic, now included in the collectorship of Chingleput. From Madras it extends northward to the Pullicat Lake; southward to Allumparva; and westward beyond Conjeveram; being about 108 miles along shore, and 47 inland in the widest part, containing altogether 2440 square miles.\n\nIn this district the land betwixt the Saymbrumbacum tank and that of Sri Permaturu is nowhere so steep as to prevent the use of the plough, but in most places the soil is very indifferent. The rocks, or large detached masses of granite, project in many parts of the fields, and almost everywhere the country is overrun with low prickly bushes. In this particular part of the district, except in a few fields, which in the rainy season are sown with ragy and other dry grains, there is no cultivation. It appears too dry for any useful purpose, except furnishing a scanty pasture. The palmira thrives on it without trouble, and is both cheap and abundant. The tari, or fermented juice, and the jayori, or insipidated juice of this tree, (the horassus flabelliformis) are in this quarter more esteemed than those of the wild date, which is contrary to the opinion of the Bengalese. Could it be converted into a palatable spirituous liquor or sugar, the barren plains of the Carnatic might be rendered productive. At Sri Permaturu there is a tank, which serves to water the lands of one village, amounting to 2500 acres. Bamboos in this district are very scarce, and sell for three times their cost in Calcutta. Recently the natives have been encouraged to plant them round their houses.\n\nThe territory named the Jaghire was obtained in the year 1750 and 1763 from the Nabob of Arcot, in return for services rendered to him and his father by the Company, and was rented to the Nabob on renewed leases until 1780, when the presidency of Fort St. George took the management of it. This district was twice invaded by Hyder Ali, in 1768, and in the war of 1780, when he ravaged it with fire and sword. On the termination of the latter war, in 1784, hardly any other signs were left in many parts of the country of its having been inhabited by human beings, than the bones of the bodies that had been massacred, or the naked walls of the houses, choultries, and temples, which had been burnt. To the havoc of war succeeded a destructive famine, and the emigrations from these successive calamities nearly depopulated the country.\n\nIn 1790 the Jaghire was divided into two collectorships; but in 1794 was united the management of Mr. Place, who continued until 1798. Annual village settlements of the revenue continued to be made until 1802, when the permanent assessment took place; the lands having previously been divided into 61 estates, bearing an assessment of from 2000 to 5000 pagodas, and sold to individuals. Although the land be much inferior in fertility, the condition of the natives throughout the Jaghire appears fully equal to that of Bengal. (F. Buchanan, 5th Report, Rennel, &c.)\n\nJagraam, (Jayagrama).\u2014A Seik town in the province of Delhi, 100 miles S. E. from Lahore. Lat. 30\u00b0. 47'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. E.\n\nJahil.\u2014A town in the Rajpoot territories, in the province of Ajmeer, 65 miles W. N. W. from Jynagur. Lat. 27\u00b0. 9'. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 38'.

This place is remarkable for two decisive battles; the first fought on the 8th of June, 1658, wherein Aurungzebe totally defeated his brother Dara Shikoh; and the last on the 19th of June, 1707, between the son and grandson of Aurungzebe, Shah Alam and Azimushan, in which the latter was slain. (Hunter, &c.)\n\nJains.\u2014See Sravana, Belgulu, and South Canara.\n\nJaiver.\u2014A town in the province of Delhi, situated on the east side of the Jamuna, 43 miles S. by E. from Delhi. Lat. 28\u00b0. 9'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 28'. E.\n\nJajarcote, (Jharjhara Cata, the Bamboo Fort).\u2014A town in Northern Hindostan, tributary to the Goorakhali Rajah of Nepaul. Lat. 29\u00b0. 39'. N. Long. 81\u00b0. 30'. E.\n\nJajghur.\u2014A town in the province of Ajmeer, which was wrested from the Rana of Odeypoor by Zalim Singh of Kotah about the year 1803. The surrounding district comprehends 84 towns and villages, 22 of which are exclusively inhabited by Meenas, who pay only personal service to the government they live under.\n\nThe Meenas are a stout, handsome people, and go armed with a bow, a quiver, and a dagger, at the use of which they are very expert. Each village has a civil officer of its own, who manages the affairs of the community according to their peculiar customs. They do not marry with any other tribe, and the singular custom prevails of the second brother marrying the widow of the eldest. If the second brother dies the third takes her, until she becomes too old to be taken by any body. They are thieves and robbers by profession, and maintain themselves when on service solely by plunder. They make a practice of carrying off the children from any village they attack; the boys are bred up as Meenas, and they sell the girls in the neighbouring province. They worship principally Mahadeva.\n\nThe fort of Jajghur is built on the top of an oblong hill detached from the main range. It consists of two walls, flanked with round bastions, the outer being at a considerable distance from the inner one, and nearly half way down the hill, each wall having a ditch. The town lies to the north west, and is large, well built, and fortified. (Broughton, &c.)\n\nJalah.\u2014A town in the Rajpoot territories, in the province of Ajmeer, 44 miles S. S. E. from Jynagur.

E.\n\nJallinder, (Jalendra, the Chief of Waters).\u2014A town in the province of Lahore, situated in the Doabeh of the Sutuleje and Beyah, 92 miles E. S. E. from the city of Lahore. This is a place of great extent, but now in ruins. It was formerly the residence of the Afghans, and is now inhabited by their descendants, and by the Seiks, who are dominant here. The modern houses are constructed from the materials of the ruinous houses formerly occupied by the Afghans. In 1808 Jallinder was held in Jaghire by two brothers at war with each other; in consequence of which they kept up a constant discharge of fire arms during the day, and at night set fire to each others corn fields. When Runjeet Singh, the Seik Rajah of Lahore, reduced this part of the province, wherever he met with no opposition he restored the towns and their dependencies to their former proprietors, to be held of him as Jaghires. The chiefs are feudatories to the Rajah, but pay him no fixed tribute. (11th Register, &c.)\n\nJalnah, (Jalna).\u2014A district in the Nizam's territories, in the province of Aurungabad, situated principally between the 19th and 20th degrees of north latitude. At the peace with the Maharattas in 1803 it was ceded to the British, and afterwards in\nApril, 1804, by them ceded to the Nizam, with whom it remains.\n\nJALNAH.\u2014A town in the province of Aurungabad, belonging to the Nizam, the capital of a district of the same name. It was taken from the Maharattas by the army under Col. Stevenson in Sept. 1803, and is now the head-quarters of the Hyderabad subsidiary force. It is divided by a small river, on one side of which is a town, and on the other a town with a fort. (7th and 12th Registers.)\n\nJALOOAN.\u2014A town in the province of Agra, situated on the south side of the Sinde River, 115 miles S.E. from Agra. Lat. 26\u00b0 7' N. Long. 79\u00b0 23' E. A considerable quantity of cotton is annually sent from this town to Bengal. It is transported by land to the town of Caunpoor on the Ganges, a distance little exceeding 70 miles. From thence it is brought to Mirzapoor by water, and there sells on a medium for two pounds sterling per ewi. (Colebrooke, &c.)\n\nJALORE.\u2014A town and fortress in the Rajpoot territories, in the province of Ajmeer, 55 miles S.S.W. from Jondpoor. Lat. 25\u00b0 44' N. Long. 72\u00b0 56' E. In 1580 this was the capital of an independent Hindoo principality, and at that time reduced by the Emperor Achber.\n\nJALORE.\u2014A town in the Rajpoot territories, in the province of Ajmeer, 53 miles S.E. from Odeypoor. Lat. 24\u00b0 47' N. Long. 74\u00b0 26' E.\n\nJAMBOE, (Jambu).\u2014A district in the province of Lahore, situated about the 33d degree of north latitude. It is separated from the Kish-tewar territory by the River Chinaub; on the east it is bounded by independent Hindoo districts; on the south by Bissolie; and on the west by the Punjab. The limits of the Jamboe Rajah fluctuate greatly according to circumstances, and he is generally tributary to the Seiks. In 1783 the revenues of this principality were estimated at five lacks of rupees, besides the produce of Buddoo, and Chandahna, or Chinanah.\n\nThe face of the country is hilly and woody, and the greater part but thinly inhabited, owing to the incursions of the Seiks and the predatory habits of the natives. The road to the city of Jamboe, in a south-west direction, lies through a delite of sand for many miles, the sides of which consist of lofty rocks nearly perpendicular.\n\nJAMBOE.\u2014A town in the province of Lahore, 83 miles N.by E. from the city of Lahore, the capital of a district of the same name. Lat. 38\u00b0 N. Long. 74\u00b0 5'. E. This town is situated on the side of a hill, and contains two distinct divisions, which are termed the Upper and the Lower Towns. The bottom of the hill is washed by the Rayey, here about 40 or 50 yards broad, and fordable at most seasons of the year, with many water-mills for grinding corn on its banks. Jamboe is a town of considerable commercial resort, being an entrepot between Cashmere and Hindostan. The shawls when exported from Cashmere are packed in bales of a certain weight and quantity, of an ascertained value, and are seldom opened until they reach their destined market. The bales are carried usually by men, who in general are Cashmerians, the height and steepness of the mountains precluding the employment of cattle in this traffic. At this place the white mulberry is of a large size and exquisite flavour. (Foster, &c.)\n\nJAMBEE.\u2014A district on the northeastern coast of Sumatra, extending along a river of the same name, which has its principal source in the Liman country. The town of Jambee is situated about 60 miles from the sea, and at an early stage of European commerce had Dutch and English factories. In 1629 it was attacked by a Portuguese squadron, which was employed 22 days in ascending the river to attack some Dutch vessels.\n\nThe trade here consists chiefly in gold dust, pepper, and canes; but the greatest part of the first article\nproceeds across the country to the western coast, and the quality of the second is not held in esteem. The port is consequently but little frequented, except by native merchants. (Horsden, &c.)\n\nJANAGUR, (Jayanagar).\u2014A town possessed by independent native chiefs, in the province of Gujrat, situated in a low fenny district on the west side of the Banass River. Lat. 23\u00b0. 35'. N. Long. 71\u00b0. 17'. E.\n\nJAPARA.\u2014A Dutch residency on the north coast of Java, yielding rice and timber for small vessels. Lat. 6\u00b0. 28'. S. Long. 110\u00b0. 54'. E. About three miles inland is the ancient Javanese city of Japara, which was formerly the residence of the sovereigns of a state of that name. (Stavorinus, &c.)\n\nJARASOO.\u2014A small town in the Rajpoot territories, in the province of Ajmeer, 30 miles S. S. E. from Jynagur. Lat. 26\u00b0. 36'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 58'. E.\n\nJAUKDEO, (Jagadeva).\u2014A district in the Baranahal province, situated above the Eastern Ghats, and now comprehended in the collectorship of Kistnagherry. The principal towns are Kistnagherry and Ryacotta. This district forms part of the ancient Hindoo division of Dravida.\n\nJAVEMOW, (or Samow).\u2014A town in the province of Allahabad, situated on the S. W. side of the Ganges, 42 miles S. W. from Lucknow. Lat. 26\u00b0. 55'. N. Long. 109\u00b0. 25'. E.\n\nJAVELDA, (Jaluda).\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Pachete, 160 miles N. W. from Calcutta. Lat. 23\u00b0. 22'. N. Long. 86\u00b0. 4'. E.\n\nJAVUMAD.\u2014A town in the Nizam's territories, in the province of Berar, 52 miles E. from Boorhanpoor. Lat. 21\u00b0. 13'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 7'. E.\n\nJAVA, (Yara, Barley).\n\nA large island in the Eastern Seas, situated between the sixth and ninth degrees of south latitude, and extending nearly in the direction of east and west. To the south and west its shores are washed by the Indian Ocean; to the north-west lies the Island of Sumatra; to the north, Borneo; to the north-east, Celebes; and to the east it is separated by two narrow straits from the Islands of Madura and Bali. In length it may be estimated at 600 miles, by 95 the average breadth.\n\nThe arm of the sea between Java and Sumatra is known by the appellation of the Straits of Sunda, and is about 20 miles wide in the narrowest part. The coast, from the Straits of Sunda, rises by degrees to a range of hills, which commence at the east in the province of Balambouang, and continue through it to the westward, gradually decreasing in height, and dividing the island longitudinally into two parts, of which the northern section is the largest and best. The whole extent of the north coast is low, swampy, and woody ground, except a little way to the west of Bantam, where the high land stretches down to the sea-coast. Among the mountains in the centre of the island there is a volcano still smoking.\n\nOn the north side there are several deep inlets or bays, such as those of Bantam, Batavia, Cheribon, Samarang, Joana, and Sourabhaya, where there is good anchorage in moderate depths, during the good or south-east monsoon; but, in the bad monsoon, when the north-west wind blows hard, and raises a sea, it is dangerous to anchor near the coast. The southern coasts of Java are much less known than the northern, being a bold rocky shore, almost inaccessible, and hitherto but imperfectly surveyed.\n\nThe eastern extremity of Java is but thinly inhabited, and very little cleared or cultivated. Bagnouwanguie, a Dutch establishment on the Straits of Bally, is separated from the station of Panaroukan by an immense wilderness, across a mountainous country, covered with thick\nwoods, abounding with tigers, buffaloes, leopards, and large apes, and only to be penetrated by a narrow path, bordered on each side by thick grass, nine or ten feet high, the tract being only known to the natives. This path continues up and down hill, and crosses several rivers made rugged by projecting rocks.\n\nJava is watered by a great number of rivers, which all descend from the central chain of mountains; but none of them are navigable for ships or large vessels, on account of their shallow water, and being impeded at their outlets by sand and mud banks, over most of which there is not one foot depth of water at low ebb. The most considerable river is that of Joana, and the Sedani, or Tangerang. On the bank or bar before Batavia the flood rises about six feet, and at spring tides rather more. High and low water occur at Batavia only once in 24 hours.\n\nThe year in Java is divided into two seasons; one of which is called the east or dry monsoon, and the other the west monsoon, or rainy season. The east or good monsoon commences in the months of April and May, and finishes the end of September, or the beginning of October. The trade winds then blow from four or five leagues off shore, through the whole of the Indian Seas to the south of the line from the S E. and E. S. E. at times going as far south as S. S. E. with fine dry weather.\n\nThe west or bad monsoon generally begins the latter end of November, or early in December. While it continues the wind often blows with great violence, and is accompanied by heavy torrents of rain, which render the season generally unhealthy. The same winds are found to prevail every where to the south of the line, and last until the conclusion of February, or commencement of March, from which time they are very variable until April, when the easterly winds begin to blow. Hence these three months, as also October and part of November, are called the shifting months, and the breaking up of the monsoons are considered at Batavia as the most unhealthy season of the year.\n\nAs far as nine or 10 degrees south of the line, when the westerly winds prevail, the contrary takes place at the same time and distance to the north of it, and vice versa, when to the north the westerly winds blow, the easterly prevail to the south of the line; which alteration greatly assists the navigation of Java.\n\nAlong the coast of Java the land and sea breezes blow every day, without exception, and moderate the intensity of the heat. The sea breeze which, in the east monsoon, is generally confined between E. N. E. and N. but in the west monsoon goes as far as N. W. begins to blow about 11 or 12 o\u2019clock in the forenoon. It increases gradually in the afternoon until evening, and then dies imperceptibly away until eight or nine, when it becomes perfectly calm. The land wind begins at midnight, or just before, and continues until an hour or two after sun-rise, when it falls calm again until the sea breeze comes on at its accustomed hour.\n\nFrom the month of July to November, the thermometer at Batavia ranges from 80 to 90 in the hottest time of the day, and, during the greatest coolness of the morning, is seldom lower than 76\u00b0. The warmth of the air decreases on approaching the mountains, which lie towards the centre of the island. At a country seat of the governor\u2019s, named Buitenzorg, 40 miles south from Batavia, and situated at the foot of the blue mountains, the air is healthy and refreshing, and the cold so great in the mornings and evenings, that thick clothes are necessary. The barometer throughout the whole year scarcely undergoes any variation, and never exceeds two or three lines.\nNear to Brambanan, in the centre of the island, there is a lofty ridge of mountains, extending in a direction from north to south. One of these is a volcano, and the whole chain is of extraordinary fertility, and cultivated for two-thirds of their height. The thermometer, as the traveller ascends, gradually sinks from 85\u00b0, the ordinary height in the plain, to near 50\u00b0 at the summit of the mountains. The heat during the day, in the highest parts that are cultivated, is from 60 to 65, and at night is as low as 54\u00b0. Here the soil is fertile, and the clouds that overhang the mountain tops supply abundance of water. All the productions of Europe, hardly one of which will flourish below, are here cultivated with success. These hills produce considerable quantities of wheat and potatoes of an excellent quality. Even oats and barley have been tried with great success, as also some European fruits.\n\nOn account of the luxuriant soil, many parts of Java are covered with thick forests, which it is difficult to penetrate, owing to the quantity of underwood and creeping plants (some of the latter above 100 feet in length), which form a sort of a net, and are impassable without the aid of a cutting instrument. In some of the more open spots spiders' webs are found of a remarkable degree of strength, and the matted grass swarms with snakes and venomous reptiles.\n\nThe soil of Java may generally be considered as pure vegetable mould resting on clay, argillaceous iron stone, or coarse limestone of a loose porous texture. It is remarkable that the soil of Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula should be remarkable sterile, while that of Java, so contiguous to both, should exceed in fertility almost any country in the world. Of this it is a sufficient proof that sugar cane, tobacco, and other plants, which, in the richest parts of India, require an abundant supply of manure, are here raised in greater perfection without any assistance of that description; and to this difference of soil the superior population and more early improvement of Java are chiefly to be ascribed.\n\nPloughing in Java is chiefly done by buffaloes, but the plough in use is a very clumsy machine. One or two buffaloes are yoked to it, and guided by a Chinese, or Javanese, who performs the tillage very leisurely. Horses are plenty, but of a diminutive size. But little manure is used by the natives; the principal trouble taken is that of collecting and burning the weeds, and when one piece of ground ceases to yield adequate crops another is resorted to, and the first allowed to lie fallow until it is refreshed. Garden grounds are cultivated with great care, and moistened with water, in which oil cakes and other cakes of manure have been soaked, which greatly enriches the soil.\n\nBy Ptolemy Java is named the Island of Barley; but the grain is unknown to the Javanese, and will not grow in any part of the island, except a few cold mountainous tracts, where it has been cultivated through the curiosity of the Europeans. The first production of Java, in quantity and importance, is rice, which, in whiteness, quality, and flavour, excels that of all the Eastern Archipelago, and ranks next to that of Japan. This island produces not only a sufficiency for its own consumption, but also supplies many of the adjacent countries, and all the more easterly Dutch settlements. Of this grain there are two species, one which is planted in water, and kept moist by irrigation; the other is planted during the rainy season on high ground, and receives its supply of water solely from the rains. The low land rice is planted in May, while the upland rice is planted in November, and reaped in March. The last brings the best price, being a whiter, harder, and better flavoured grain, and hav-\ning greatly the advantage in respect to keeping. The other is much more productive, and subject to less risk in the culture; but it is of watery substance, and liable to a more rapid decay. Besides this general distinction, the rice of each sort, particularly the upland, presents a variety of species.\n\nThe next staple of Java is pepper, of which much the greater proportion of the whole is produced in the principality of Bantam; in 1757 the whole amounted to six millions of pounds. The cultivation of this spice in other countries having since been greatly encouraged, and the demand in Europe diminished, added to the long blockade of the Dutch ports, the quantity raised in Java has decreased also.\n\nSugar is chiefly the production of the district of Jacatra; but it is also manufactured in that of Cheribon, and along the north-eastern coast of Java. In 1768 the whole produce exceeded 15 millions of pounds, and was capable of being greatly augmented. The cane grows luxuriantly, and it is a favourite article of culture with the Chinese, who are the great sugar planters and manufacturers. Their works are not so solidly constructed, nor so enormously expensive, as those in the West Indies. When the manufacture is completed, the sugar is divided into three qualities; the first of which is sent to Europe, the second to the west of India, and the third, which is the brownest, to Japan.\n\nCoffee is an article yielding large crops in Java, and cultivated in the same manner as in the West Indies. In 1768 the quantity produced exceeded five millions of pounds; and, like sugar, its production is capable of being greatly increased.\n\nThe cotton shrub is raised in many parts of the island, but does not form an article of export. Salt is brought in large quantities from Rembang to Batavia, and from thence re-exported, a considerable portion being sent to the S.W. coast of Sumatra. The indigo plant grows luxuriantly, and the quantity raised, although hitherto small, may be greatly increased; turmeric and long pepper are also produced and exported.\n\nThe north-east coast and part of the Cheribon district furnish a large quantity of logs, beams, boards, knees, and other pieces of timber for the consumption of Batavia, for ship-building, and occasionally for the out-settlements and the Cape of Good Hope. The large forests belong to the Dutch East India Company as sovereigns, and the wood is felled and prepared by the natives at a moderate expense.\n\nThe Island of Java is particularly abundant in fruit and fruit trees, among which may be enumerated the cocoa nut and many other palms, oranges, citrons, tamarinds, shaddock, lemons, the jack tree, mangoes, mangosteen, pine apples, bananas, the sweetsop, custard apple, the rambutan, and guava; in addition to which are grapes, melons, pumpkins, pomegranates, and figs. The mangosteen is reckoned the most delicious fruit of the east, and is of a singularly good flavour in Java. The tree on which it grows is extremely beautiful, bearing, like the orange, both fruit and flowers at the same time. The fruit is nearly a perfect sphere, of a bright or dark purple, according to the degree of ripeness. It rests on a green calyx, the upper part surmounted by a corona, which is generally divided into as many rays as the fruit consists of lobes, which are of a white, delicate, pulpy substance, covering each a small nut. The husk, or shell, contains a brown astringent juice.\n\nThe celebrated upas, or poison tree, of which the account, by Forsch, attracted little attention, until it was inserted as a note to Dr. Darwin's Poem of the Botanic Garden, is now established to be entirely of fabulous existence, and a\nbold experiment on the credulity of persons at a distance.\n\nThe great boa snake found in the forests of Java is superior in magnitude to the alligator, and no less formidable in other respects. Some of this species have been killed 39 feet long. The other animals are, in every respect, similar to those of Sumatra, where a more particular description will be found. For one species of the monkey genus, called the Wow Wow, the Javanese pretend to have a fellow-feeling, there being a tradition among them that their ancestors originally sprung from this species of ape.\n\nIn Java every object seems impregnated with life. A glass of water taken out of the canal at Batavia, becomes in a few hours a collection of animated matter; the minute portions of which multiplying by division and subdivision, move about with astonishing rapidity; and the bay swarming with myriads of living creatures, exhibits in the night time a phosphorescent light. The insect tribes are also extremely numerous; snakes, scorpions, spiders, ants, musquitos, fire flies, and many other dangerous and disgusting vermin, swarm in the roads, houses, and bed chambers. A venomous spider is very common in the thickets of Java, the body of which is two inches in diameter, and the length of the fore legs or claws four inches, covered with hair, the colour black, and the mouth red. The forests and mountains contain an immense number and variety of birds, from the cassowary to the humming bird, which is little larger than a common bee. Among the birds are beautiful lorries and parrots, argus pheasants, the golden thrush, and kings fisher.\n\nWhen the Dutch first established themselves in Java, the island was divided into three great states, Bantam, Jacatra, and the empire of the Soesoehoenan; which last was the most extensive, and comprehended two-thirds of the whole island. The people throughout speak the same language, and have the same manners, habits, and customs. History and tradition relate, that they were once united under one sovereign; a fact which the present state of their language and institutions tends to corroborate. The form of government among the Javanese is essentially despotic, and answers to the most abstract idea of unlimited uncontrolled power. The will of a Javanese prince is literally law, and there exists neither civil nor religious institutions to oppose a barrier to it.\n\nAmong the people there are no hereditary ranks or distinctions; the monarch by his authority may raise the humblest peasant to the first rank in the empire, or level the highest with the meanest of his subjects. He is heir to all under his dominion, and land in particular is his exclusive property. Large tracts of territory are frequently given one day, and resumed the next; and neither grant nor occupation can give a subject the remotest claim to permanent property. Portions of land are given in place of salaries to the officers of government, and revoked at pleasure. So fluctuating is the possession of such gifts, that hardly in any instance are lands at present held by the heirs of those who occupied them 30 years ago.\n\nFrom this state of property it results that there is no hereditary nobility in Java, which would be incompatible with the unbounded prerogatives of the prince; yet the Javanese are not without their titles of nobility. These are conferred during pleasure, but carry with them notwithstanding extraordinary privileges, or rather an extensive power to do mischief. In proportion to their degree, they command the veneration of the superstitious people, who consider them as an emanation from royalty, and respect them accordingly.\n\nThe people and privileged orders, being thus so greatly separated, di-\nvide the community into two classes, the distinction of which is so marked and humiliating, that it has affected the Javanese language; the men of rank actually speaking one language, and the plebeians another, which differ as much as any two dialects of the same European tongue. The nobleman would think himself degraded by using the language of the inferior classes, and it would be a dangerous presumption in the latter to assume the language of their superiors. This distinction of language is carried still further, for it is still more nicely adapted to the different gradations of rank; and with regard to the sovereign in particular, in a variety of instances he makes use of one language, and is spoken to in another, both exclusively appropriated to himself. The Javanese language, besides these strange effects produced on it by the constitution of the society, carries with it marks of a copiousness flowing from other sources; probably the union of many dialects in one, apparently of long cultivation, affording a strong presumption of considerable antiquity, and overflowing with words of pure sanscrit.\n\nWhen a Javanese subject comes into the presence of his prince, he assumes the most abject position, rather crawling than walking, both in approaching and withdrawing. Instead of shewing his respect by the decency of his attire as in Europe, however high his rank, he anxiously displays the relative meanness of his condition by appearing in a state of half-naked raggedness, and his language corresponds with his dress. To his monarch he speaks with awe and reverence approaching to adoration, and instead of attempting to recommend himself by the elegance and propriety of his discourse, he selects the language of an ignorant and abject slave; and not unfrequently mimics some barbarous idiom, to express more emphatically the immeasurable inequality of his condition, compared with that of his sovereign. In Java and all the adjacent countries, to sit and not to stand is the posture of respect. An inferior never presumes to stand in the presence of a person of superior rank.\n\nAt present Java is divided into five principal states or governments, which are Bantam, Jacatra, Cheribon, the empire of the Soesohocheman, and that of the sultan. These are again subdivided into 123 districts, each of which contain a certain number of inhabitants. The population of Java was estimated by Valentyn at 3,300,000, and the Dutch authors assert, that it has since been progressively decreasing; but it does not appear there is any solid foundation for this opinion. In 1792 it was estimated by the gentlemen of Lord Macartney's embassy, at 2,300,000. It is said that in 1808 General Daendels caused a census to be taken, by the returns of which, exclusive of the south coast of the island, the population appeared to exceed three millions.\n\nBy the system of the Dutch government the country is divided into districts, over each of which is a chief or governor, called Tomongong; whose duty it is to take care that the full share of the peasant's produce be delivered, for the use of the sovereign, the Dutch, and themselves. The princes of the different states into which Java is subdivided are all more or less under the influence of the Dutch East India Company, which maintains forts and garrisons throughout their dominions.\n\nThe Chinese in Java are very numerous, and severely taxed by the Dutch; notwithstanding which, these industrious persons find means to pay the tax imposed, and accumulate wealth. They intermarry with the Javanese and Malays, and purchase female slaves for wives and concubines. Many of them, particularly at Batavia, carry on very considerable trade with their native country and the several islands of\nthe Eastern Archipelago, as well as a coasting trade from one part to another of Java; in all the principal towns of which the Chinese form the great capitalists. Along with these laborious habits it is remarkable that they are extremely addicted to gaming, permission for which is farmed out. In Batavia, the officers who control the Chinese gaming-houses are required to pay to the Dutch government a monthly contribution of 3100 rix dollars, or about 8000l. sterling per annum.\n\nThe Javanese are in general about the middle size of Europeans, straight and well made, all the joints of their hands and feet remarkably small, and the colour of their skin a deep brown, approaching to black. Their eyes are black and prominent, the nose rather broad and somewhat flattened. The hair is black, and kept smooth and shining with cocoa nut oil. By the women it is twisted into a knot on the top of the head; where it is fixed with gold or silver pins, and decorated with sweet smelling flowers. Among the Javanese jet black is the favourite colour for the teeth, comparing to monkeys those who keep them of the natural colour. They in consequence of this taste stain their teeth of the deepest black, except the two front ones, which they cover with gold leaf. Whenever the dye or gilding is worn off, they are very attentive in replacing it on the proper teeth.\n\nThat attention to personal cleanliness, which distinguishes the Hindoos, is unknown to the Javanese, who on the contrary are remarkable for their filthiness. In point of diet they are most indiscriminate and voracious, seldom observing any regular meals; and, although Mahommedans, indulging freely in intoxicating liquors, even at their religious ceremonies. They differ also in other respects from the Hindoos, particularly with respect to their females, to whose chastity they are perfectly indifferent; and perhaps there is no people in the world who, in this respect, exhibit a greater depravity of morals. Even with the Sumatrans and Malays they form a striking contrast. The usual food of those who inhabit the low country is rice with a little fish, but in the high lands among the mountains many make use of a certain root called tallas, with the salt which they procure from wood ashes.\n\nTheir principal weapon is a creese, which is a kind of dagger, with a blade of hardened steel, of a serpentine shape, and from its form capable of making a large and wide wound. The dress of the lower classes consists of a piece of cotton cloth, which they wrap round their waist, and passing through between their legs fasten up behind. Their dwellings are constructed of split bamboos, interlaced or matted, plastered with clay, and covered with leaves of the cocoa nut tree. The whole house usually consists of but one apartment, in which husband, wife, children, and the poultry they keep, all lie together on the ground. Like all the rest of the Sunda islanders they are immoderately fond of cock fighting, which is a source of revenue to the Dutch East India Company, who make them pay for permission to keep these birds. This tax is peculiar to the province of Jacatra, and, in 1770, produced 35l. 10s. per month.\n\nThe Javanese are polygamists, and marry as many wives as they can maintain, besides keep a numerous retinue of female slaves in the capacity of concubines. This however does not occur with the lower classes, who have only one wife. Females are usually married at the age of 10 or 12, until which time they go nearly naked, wearing only a belt round their waist, with a metal plate in front, rings round their wrists, chains about the neck, and flowers in their black shining hair. When a girl is espoused she rides about the town, accompanied by her friends, the relations and slaves of both families, with a band of noisy music.\nThis is generally her first and last public exhibition; for if she marries into a family of condition, she is shut up for the remainder of her life. The women are in proportion more comely than the men, and very much attached to Europeans, of whom they are extremely jealous.\n\nThe private hours of a Javanese prince are mostly passed in the society, or at least in the presence of women. His day is consumed with the most placid apathy in smoking his hookah, while a troop of dancing men or women are supposed to afford him amusement. At other times the females of his seraglio relate the long traditionary stories and adventures of the ancient heroes and demigods, contained in their Cheritras, or sacred books, which are derived from the mythological fables of the Hindu Puranas. The heat of the climate has been alleged as an apology for the indolence of the Javanese, but the fallacy of this position is proved by the industry of the Chinese, who in diligence and perseverance in manual labour surpass many of the most industrious classes in Europe. These inhabit the same island, and open their variegated shops, and till the soil neglected by the natives amidst whom they reside.\n\nThe Java, or Javanese language, is admitted by the Malays to be that of a more ancient nation than themselves, and seems at one time to have been current throughout the whole extent of Java. It is so essentially distinct from the Malay, that these people are not in the least intelligible to each other, and in the interior of the island not one native among 10,000 can speak the Malay. The alphabet of Java is peculiar, and has no resemblance in the order of position to the Deva nagari. The Malays of Java frequently use the Javanese character to express their own language, and have also translated the Koran into Javanese. The literature of the Javanese is similar to that of the Malays, but apparently of prior origin.\n\nThe early civilization of the Javanese is rendered still more credible by their possession of an era and a methodical division of time, which is probably of Hindoo origin. The year A.D. 1814 corresponds with the 17-41st of the Javanese era. The Hindoo names for the days of the week, though now obsolete, are universally known to the learned Javanese. It is also a remarkable circumstance, and a proof of their imperfect conversion, that the Javanese are the only Mahomedans who have not adopted the epocha of the flight of Mahomed, considered among his followers as an indispensable article of faith.\n\nThat the Javanese once professed the Hindoo religion in some form is proved by many facts. Besides the corroboration presented by their language, there are the relics of the Hindoo religion still adhering to them; the traditions which exist of their ancient belief, and the temples and idols peculiar to Hindoo superstition, with inscriptions in the sacred languages of that faith.\n\nThe penances and austerities of the Hindoo ritual are still occasionally practised by the Javanese, and their virtue in conferring supernatural power over gods, men, and the elements, still seriously believed in. By all connected with the royal blood, and by them only, the flesh of the cow is religiously abstained from. There is scarcely any reason to believe that the institution of castes (the grand Brahminical distinction) ever prevailed among the Javanese; from which, and from other circumstances, it is probable that the prevailing religion of Java was Buddhism; yet the temples and inscriptions found in various parts of the island furnish sufficient evidence, that the doctrines of Brahma had also obtained a footing. A few idolaters are still found in the mountains at the east end of Java, and in the neighbouring island of Bali; the religion of Buddha is the prevailing one, although some Mahomedans\nare found on the sea-coast. The most extensive remains of Hindoo religious edifices in Java are those at Borong Budor (the place of many idols), in the district of Cadoc, at Brambanam, and in the districts of Mataram and Ballanbouang.\n\nThe predominant religion at present is that of Mahommed, adulterated by many superstitious notions and observances, retained from the religion of their ancestors. In 1406 Sheikh ibn Molana, or Ben Israel, an Arabian who had greatly contributed to the propagation of the Mahommedan faith in the neighbouring countries, came to Java, and became both a powerful sovereign and venerated apostle of that religion. The Kings of Bantam and Cheribon claim him for their ancestor, and pilgrimages are performed to his mosque and mausoleum near the town of Cheribon, which edifice may rank among the most curious and magnificent antiquities of the Eastern Isles. Many other mosques and places of prayer are dispersed over the country, mostly built of wood, and without ornament of any sort. The dead are not buried in coffins by the Javanese Mahommedans, the bodies being merely wrapped in a piece of white cloth, and deposited in the grave. Over the head one stone is placed, and over the feet another, which they believe are to serve for seats to the two angels, who after their death are to examine into the nature of their conduct during their existence.\n\nIn the interior of the island more than 100 stones were discovered, in 1811, covered with inscriptions in what was supposed to be an unknown character, but which has been discovered by Mr. Marsden to be the square Pali, a sacred character of the Birmans. Among the idols found in Java, both of stone and metal, there are many of Brahma, Vishnu, Mahadeva, and Bhavani; and that of Ganesa, with his elephant head, was frequently recognized by the British officers during their late campaigns in that island. Many similar stones and figures are also to be found in the Lampung country in Sumatra.\n\nLike all other nations the early history of the Javanese is lost in the mist of fabulous antiquity. In more modern times the Javanese annals give accounts of political relations having subsisted between the states of Papagaran and Mojopahit, in Java, with those of Menaneatow, Singapura, and Palembang, in Sumatra, and with Succedana and Banjarmassin, in Borneo. This fact seems confirmed by the present condition of several of the neighbouring islands, where at this day the written language, as well as the language of the court, are Javanese, although the indigenous dialect of these islanders be entirely different. This observation applies to Madura, Balily, Sinubhaya, and Lombhook, which once formed part of the dominions of the princes of Mojopahit, and which appear also to have received the whole of their literature from Java.\n\nFor more than a century the Dutch remained in unmolested possession of this large and fertile island, and might have continued so, but for the French revolution, which brought them under subjection to that nation, and rendered an attack necessary on the part of the British. An expedition was in consequence dispatched from India under Sir Samuel Auchmuty, which landed on the 4th August, 1811; on the 8th the city of Batavia surrendered at discretion; on the 9th a sharp action took place at Welte Freden, with the corps d'elite of the Gallo Batavian army, which was driven into the strongly intrenched camp at Cornelis. On the 26th this post was carried by assault, when the whole of the enemy's army, consisting of upwards of 10,000 disciplined troops, were either killed, taken, or dispersed; and with this action concluded the Dutch sovereignty of Java. Even prior to this they held the\nisland by rather a precarious tenure, and were obliged to adopt the sinister policy of fomenting a constant disunion among the more powerful princes of Java, who govern under the titles of allies' and tributaries, and to retain them in due subordination large reinforcements from Europe were annually requisite.\n\nShort as the period has been considerable improvements have taken place in Java since the British obtained possession, and more were in contemplation. Considerable portions of the Cadowan Forest, in the Paccalongang district, have been rented out to cultivators, who have engaged to convert the land, now covered with jungle, into rice fields in three years. The high eastern road, which runs through this forest, is said to have cost the lives of above 3000 persons in making, during the government of General Daendael, and the whole must continue very unhealthy until the country is better cleared. An improved system of police has been introduced, which abrogated the extreme severity of the Dutch code, and at the same time proved infinitely more effectual in the prevention of crimes. New arrangements have also been established for the collection of the revenue, the total amount of which has been considerably augmented, although levied on the natives in a less oppressive manner than before; and the long blockade of Java having ceased with its capture, the colonial and coasting trade to the adjacent isles are progressively increasing.

It is built of fine stone, and situated on a high hill in a beautiful country, and has a very majestic appearance. Attached to it is an establishment of dancing girls, who, in 1792, amounted to 250 in number; with many Brahmins, and beggars innumerable.\n\nThis temple is very rich, 6000l. being annually expended on account of the idol, who has horses and elephants kept for him; and with his spouse is daily bathed in rose and Ganges water, although the latter is brought from the distance of above 1000 miles. They are also perfumed with Otr of roses, and decorated with gems. The revenues are de-\nrived from houses and lands given by pious persons, and from the offerings of votaries of all descriptions. The dancing girls, however numerous, are probably not a source of expense, but rather of revenue to the temple.\n\nThis is a favourite place among the Maharattas for performing the ceremony of swinging. In order to expiate their sins a blunt hook is inserted into the fleshy part of the penitent's back, who is hoisted up to the top of a pole from 20 to 50 feet high, and from thence swung round on a transverse moveable beam, as many times as is judged necessary.

The nature of the access to it renders the descent, in the face of an enemy, nearly as difficult as the access; so that a very small body of men, with artillery, are adequate to blockade a strong garrison, which renders the place of little use, except as a safeguard for treasure.

From the extreme barrenness of this region it has hitherto attracted little attention, and remains almost unknown. The greater part of the country is an uninterrupted tract of sand, intersected by no rivers, and the well water being only procurable from a very great depth under ground. Being however within the influence of the periodical rains, its complete sterility must in some respects, be attributed to the nature of the government; the country being subdivided among a number of petty chiefs, in a state of perpetual hostility with each other. This district was never completely subdued by any of the invaders of Hindostan, and remains in the possession of its original inhabitants, who are of the Hindoo Brahminical religion, but very few in number.\n\nJesselmere.\u2014A town in the province of Ajmeer, the capital of a district of the same name. Lat. 27\u00b0 44'. N. Long. 72\u00b0 16'. E.\n\nJessore, (Jasar, the Bridge).\u2014A district in the province of Bengal; situated between the 22d and 24th degrees of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by the Ganges; to the south by the sea; on the east it has Kishenagur; and on the west Daoca Jelalpoor and Backergunge.\n\nThe southern part of this district is in the Sunderbunds, and composed of salt marshy islands covered with wood, formed by alluvion and the successive changes of the channels of the Ganges. Some parts lie so low that bunds, or embankments, are necessary to protect them from inundation; the land is however very fertile, and were it sufficiently populated and cultivated, would produce inexhaustible supplies of rice. At present a great proportion of the southern tracts of this district, although so near to Calcutta, is waste, covered with jungle, and inhabited only by salt makers and river pirates, the latter of whom infest the innumerable branches of the Gauges by which it is intersected.\n\nThe zemindary of Jessore was originally named in the revenue books Yusefpoor, and was conferred early in the 18th century, by Jaffir Khan, on Kishenram, a Khaist from Orissa.\nThe principal towns are Jessore, or Moorley, Culna, and Mahmudpoor.\n\nIn 1801 by the directions of the Marquis Wellesley, then governor-general, the board of revenue in Bengal circulated various queries to the collectors of the different districts on statistical subjects. The result of their replies tended to establish the fact, that the district of Jessore contained 1,200,000 inhabitants, in the proportion of nine Mahomedans to seven Hindoos; and that the zemindar's profits on their lands were greater than in any other part of the province.\n\n**JESSWUNTNAGUR, (Yasavantnagar, the Famous City).\u2014A town in the province of Agra, 10 miles N. by W. from the city of Agra. Lat. 26\u00b0. 34'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 50'. E.**\n\n**JETRA.\u2014A fortified town in the province of Gujrat, near the N. W. frontier, and situated about 14 miles east from Theraurd. This fortress is described as a place of considerable strength, belonging to a Rajpoot Chief, who can take the field with 700 men, with which force he extorts contributions from many villages in the Therand district.**\n\n**JEPPOOR.\u2014See JYENAGUR.**\n\n**JHANSI.\u2014A town in the province of Allahabad, district of Bundelcund, 82 miles N. N. W. from Chatterpoor. Lat. 25\u00b0. 31'. N. Long. 71\u00b0. 45'. E.**\n\nThis is a considerable town, commanded by a stone fort on a high hill; to the S. E. of which, at the distance of 500 yards, is another hill nearly on a level with the fort. In 1790 the district dependent on this town yielded four lacks of rupees per annum. It then belonged to the Peshwa, and was a considerable thoroughfare between the Dekkan, Furruckabad, and the cities of the Doab. Here also was a manufactory of bows, arrows, and spears\u2014the principal weapons of the Bondelah tribes.\n\nIn 1804 a considerable tract of country in Bundelcund was held tributary to the Peshwa by Row Siva Row Bhow, the Sonbadar of Jhansi, and Nana Govind Row of Calpec. In February of that year a treaty was arranged by Captain John Baillie, the agent in Bundelcund, on the part of the British government, with Siva Row Bhow of Jhansi, by which he professed his entire submission to the British government, and to his highness the Peshwa; to whom he engaged to pay the same tribute for which he had hitherto been liable, the British government demanding no tribute whatever.\n\nHe engaged also to refer to the British government for adjustment any dispute that might arise between him and any chief in obedience to the British government, and to assist in punishing the disaffected in any of the British possessions adjacent to his territories. On the other hand, the British government engaged to assist him in quelling any disturbances that might arise in his own country, the expense to be defrayed by the party calling for aid; and on all occasions when his troops were acting in conjunction with those of the British, he agreed to delegate the command of the united forces to the British officer. In addition to these stipulations he engaged never to retain in his service any British subject, or European, without the consent of the British government. *(Hunter, Treaties, &c.)*\n\n**JHANSU-JEUNG.\u2014A castle in Tibet standing on a rock, which from its perpendicular height, and the irregularity of its cliffs, seems nearly impregnable. Lat. 28\u00b0. 50'. N. Long. 89\u00b0. 23'. E.**\n\nThe valley of Jhansu is very extensive, and has greatly the appearance of having been once under water, the bed of a lake. This valley is populous and well cultivated, and particularly famous for the manufacture of woollens, which are of two colours, garnet and white, and seldom exceed half a yard in breadth. They are woven close and thick like frieze, and are very soft to the touch, the fleece of the sheep\nbeing remarkably fine. (Turner, &c.)\n\nJhurjhooory, (Jharjhari, the Bamboo Grove).\u2014A village in the Nepaul dominions. Lat. 27\u00b0. 4'. N. Long. 85\u00b0. 29'. E.\n\nTo the south of this place lies the Jhurjhooory Forest, which is about 10 miles in breadth. This forest skirts the Nepaul territories throughout their whole extent from Seinagur to the Teesta, separating them everywhere from the Company's, or Oude dominions. It contains saul, sissu, setti saul, iron wood, a sort of black wood, the sajth, the bhurra, the sunni, and the multa. The ebony is also said to be found here. The part most-resorted to by the wood dealers is that which borders on the Boggah Pergannah in the Bettiah district\u2014timber being transported from thence to Cafentia.\n\nIn this part of the country elephants are numerous, but not much esteemed. They are not driven into a keddah, or enclosure; but are caught by snares and nooses, which generally injure, and often strangle them. The cattle from Chumparan, and other districts bordering on the Nepaul territories, graze in this forest annually for about four months, a duty being levied on buffaloes of two annas (three-pence) per head for the season. Besides elephants this forest is said to be greatly infested by tigers and rhinoceroses. While travelling through it travellers cannot make a resting place in this part of the forest, it being nowhere clear, or containing springs, which is not the case on the Goalpussra Road.\n\nJhurjhooory is a wretched village, consisting of a few herdsmen's huts scattered on the south bank of the Bukkia, the bed of which is here of considerable breadth. At this place is a tree named Dubdubea; the leaves of which abounds with galls, which are powerfully astringent, and containing from one to six winged insects. (Kirkpatrick, &c.)\n\nJhingwara.\u2014A Coolee state in the province of Gujrat, district of Chalawar, containing between five and 6000 houses. It is chiefly divided into numerous shares among different branches of the same family, of which that of Viraje is the most powerful. The inhabitants are mostly Coolees, who, like their chiefs, were originally Rajpoots, but, from some cause now unknown, have been degraded to the rank of Coolees.\n\nThe town of Jhingwara, formerly Soorecpoor, was built by Siva Row Jeysingh, Rajah of Puttnn, and the present fort by a Sheikh. In its original state, the town of Soorecpoor was much larger than the present city, and celebrated for a temple dedicated to the sun. The present Coolee inhabitants possess considerable power in this quarter of Gujrat, and have an annual revenue of one lack of rupees from 12 villages subject to their capital, and from exactions on the neighbouring districts. On the banks of the Run, near to Jhingwara, a large quantity of salt is prepared, and is also a source of revenue. The Chiefs of Jhingwara are much addicted to opium, and, as well as their subjects, are a barbarous, thievish race: the management of the revenue is engrossed by some Puttn Banyans residing in the town. (M'Murdo, &c., &c.)\n\nJhyllum River, (Vahnda).\u2014This river has its source at the foot of the great Himalaya ridge of mountains, in the south-east quarter of Cashmere. It runs through that province, and at Islamabad, in the district of Weer, is 80 yards broad. Ten miles from the city of Cashmere, owing to the hollow surface of the country, it expands into a sheet of water eight miles in circumference, named the Ouller Lake. Shortly after quitting this lake it enters the Burramoolah Mountains, and pursues the direction of the Punjab by a very rapid and crooked course, and at length emerges from the mountains in the district of Puckoli, being subsequently joined\nby the Kishengunga and Nyansook. After this it continues its course through a hilly country, until it crosses the upper or great road leading from Lahore to Attock, where the hilly part is confined to the western bank. Here formerly stood a city named Jhyhum, which communicated its name to the river for the remaining part of its course. From hence it flows along the eastern borders of the Joud Mountains, and unites with the Chimaub about 60 miles above Mooltan, losing its name in that of the latter river. Its whole course, including the windings, may be estimated to exceed 400 miles.\n\nThis river (the most westerly of the Punjab streams) is, by Abul Fazel, named the Behut, or Bedusta, in ancient Hindoo mythological poems the Indrami, and is the famous Hydaspes of Alexander. (Remmel, Foster, Abul Fazel, &c.)\n\nJigat Point, (Jagat, the World).\u2014A town and promontory at the south-west extremity of Gujrat. Lat. 22\u00b0. 12'. N. Long. 69\u00b0. 7'. E. The town surrounds the Jigat Pagoda, and is situated at the western mouth of the Goomty Creek, which is small and hollow. It is at present possessed by independent native chiefs, much addicted to piracy. Not far from Jigat Point is the site of Dwara-raja, so greatly celebrated in the Hindoo mythological poems as the place of retirement of their favourite deity Krishna, from Mathura, his birth place, in the province of Agra.\n\nJionpoor, (or Juwapoor).\u2014A district in the province of Allahabad, situated principally between the 25th and 26th degrees of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by the Goggrah and part of Oude; on the south by the Ganges; to the east it has the Goggrah; and on the west the Nabob of Oude's territories. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Jownpoor, containing 41 mahals; measurement, 870,265 begaus; revenue, 56,394,127 dams. Seyurghal, 4,717,654 dams. This sircar furnishes 915 cavalry, and 36,000 infantry.\"\n\nThe land in this district is at present under good cultivation, and well covered with wood. The surface is slightly undulated, and the view intersected by frequent clumps of mango trees. There are no fences in the fields, except occasionally where a row of Indian figs is planted along the sides of the roads. Notwithstanding this territory is almost entirely a sand, and the heat most intense, a supply of water is always to be met with at a short depth underground during the whole summer. In the neighbouring districts, belonging to the Nabob of Oude, a striking contrast is exhibited. The quantity of land in cultivation is diminished by the oppression of the government; the mango clumps, which require little care, are increased in number, and the jungle more prevalent. On the northern side of the city of Juanpoor the ruins of tombs and mosques are as numerous as on the Benares side, some being inlaid with coloured glazed tiles. The principal towns are Jionpoor, Gazypoor, and Azimgur; and with the district came into the possession of the British in 1775, as forming part of the Benares zemindary. (Lord Valentia, Abul Fazel, &c.)\n\nJionpoor, (Juanpoor).\u2014A town in the province of Allahabad, situated on the banks of the Goomty River, so named from its meandering course. Lat. 25\u00b0. 45'. N. Long. 82\u00b0. 39'. E. The fort is built of solid stone work, and rises considerably above the level of the country, in which, on all sides, are seen monuments and mosques in ruins. A suburb of clay-built huts leads to a large serai formed of the same materials, through which there is a bridge of considerable extent divided into two parts; one of which consists of 10 arches, and is over the boundary of the river during the dry season. This bridge has stood\nabout 250 years, having been erected by Monahur Khan, the governor, during the reign of Aceber, and still remains a monument of his magnificence, and of the superior skill of the architect. In the year 1773 a brigade of British troops, under Sir Robert Barker, on their way from Oude, having embarked on the River Goomty, at Sultanpoor, in the height of the rainy season, sailed over this bridge, which was then submerged, yet suffered no damage from the violence of the current. No native in modern times is capable of either planning or executing such a piece of architecture.\n\nJionpoor is said to have been founded by Sultan Feroze, of Delhi, who named it after his cousin, Faker nd Deen Jowna, and was for some time the seat of an independent empire. In the beginning of the 15th century Khaja Jehan, Vizier to Sultan Mahommed Shah, of Delhi, during the minority of the latter's son, assumed the title of Sultan Shirki, or King of the East; and, taking possession of Bahar, fixed his residence at this place. This dynasty became extinct about 1492, before which period it had been conquered by Sultan Bcloli Lodi. It was finally acquired by the Mogul dynasty during the reign of Aceber, since which period it has been gradually declining. The majority of the inhabitants are Mahommedans; but in this place reside also the Hindu sect of Rajcoomars, with whom the practice of female infanticide prevailed until it was abolished by the British government.\n\nTavelling distance from Benares 42 miles; from Lucknow, 147 miles. (Lord Valentia, Hodges, Ferishta, Stewart, Renuel, &c.)\n\nJoana.\u2014A Dutch residency on the Island of Java, which was formerly fortified. Lat. 6\u00b0. 40'. S. Long. 111\u00b0. 10'. E. The country around this place yields rice, timber, a little indigo, and the natives spin cotton yarn. The River Joana flows out of an inland lake, and is one of the largest and deepest in Java. It is navigated by boats, named permayangs, into the lake, and has several branches, one of which communicates with Samarang. Opposite to the town of Joana, upon an island formed by the river, stands a Chinese campion. At the mouth of the river there is a broad mud bank, over which there is sometimes less than a foot of water. (Stavorinus, &c., &c.)\n\nJobie Isle.\u2014A long and narrow island lying off the mouth of the great bay in the Island of Papua, or New Guinea, and situated about the second degree of south latitude. In length it may be estimated at 120 miles, by 15 the average breadth. Respecting this island very little is known, it never having been landed on, but only viewed from on board ship.\n\nJohnston's Isle.\u2014A small island, surrounded by a cluster of others, in the Eastern Seas. Lat. 3\u00b0. 11'. N. Long. 131\u00b0. 12'. E.\n\nThis island consists of low land covered with verdure and cocoa nut trees, and is about a league in circumference. The natives are a stout, robust race of men, about 200 in number, and, in many expressions of their language, resemble the Sandwich Islanders. They understand the value of iron. (Meares, &c., &c.)\n\nJohore.\u2014A town situated at the southern extremity of the Malay Peninsula, 20 miles up a river of the same name, and the capital of an independent Malay principality. Lat. 1\u00b0. 40'. N. Long. 104\u00b0. 5'. E. The natives export the produce of their country, consisting of pepper, gold, tin, and elephants' teeth, in their own prows, to Prince of Wales Island, and bring opium and other goods as a return cargo.\n\nThe kingdom of Johore was originally founded by adventurers from the Island of Sumatra. After the capture of Malacca, in 1511, by the Portuguese, the reigning sultan, Mahmood Shah, fled with the prin-\nprincipal inhabitants to the extremity of the peninsula, where they erected the city of Johore. By the Portuguese it was taken in 1608, and by the Sultan of Aceh in 1613. Throughout this district the Malay language is spoken in great purity. (Marsden, Leyden, Milburn, &c.)\n\n**Jokagur.**\u2014A town in the Maharrata territories, in the province of Khandesh, 74 miles S. E. from Oojain. Lat. 22\u00b0. 31'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 46'. E.\n\n**Joogdea, (Yngadeve).**\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Tipperah, 76 miles S. E. from Dacca. Lat. 23\u00b0.50'. N. Long. 91\u00b0. 12'. E. In the adjacent country a species of coarse baftas of an excellent and substantial fabric is manufactured; and the Company have an establishment for the manufacture of salt, which is not so much esteemed by the natives as that produced more to the west.\n\n**Jooria.**\u2014A populous and thriving sea-port town in the Gujrat Peninsula, situated on the Gulf of Cutch, 20 miles below Wowamia, and subject to the Rajah of Amran.\n\nThis place carries on a brisk trade with Mandavee and other places in the Gulf of Cutch, and occasionally with Bombay. Its vessels carry from 50 to 60 candies; the exports being chiefly cotton, ghee, oil, and hides to the southward, and coarse Dungarce cloth for Persia and Arabia. In return it receives spices of all sorts, powder, lead, and cocoanuts. The port duties are five per cent. The larger vessels cannot approach nearer than within three miles of Jooria, and the goods are afterwards brought up a creek in lighters to within one mile of the fort. The landed revenue is small, but the value of the port is about 30,000 rupees per annum, of which 11,000 are paid as tribute to the Guieowar.\n\nThis place was alienated from the Jam of Noagnagur by the Khowas family. By an agreement with the British government, executed in 1808, Khowas Suggaram and Pragjee, of this place, engaged with the Bombay government not to permit, instigate, or connive at any act of piracy committed by any person under their authority; and also to abstain from plundering vessels in distress. Reciprocal freedom of trade to be permitted by both parties. (Macmurdo, Treaties, &c.)\n\n**Joosaud.**\u2014A town in the Rajpoot territories, in the province of Ajmeer, 30 miles S. S. E. from Joundpoor. Lat. 26\u00b0. 4'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 27'. E.\n\n**Josimath, (Jyotimatha).**\u2014A village in the province of Serinagur, tributary to the Goorkhali Rajah of Nepaul. Lat. 30\u00b0. 34'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 38'. E.\n\nThis place contains from 100 to 150 houses, neatly built of grey stone, and roofed with shingles. They are raised to the height of two or three stories, and the streets are paved, although in an irregular manner. On the slope of the hill there is a line of water mills placed about 20 yards from each other. The water that turns them is supplied by a stream, which flows down the mountain, and having passed through the upper mill, is conducted to the next by a communication of troughs, made of hollowed trunks of firs.\n\nAt this town is the house of the high priest of Bhadrinath, who resides here during the six months of the year, while the temple is shut up at that place. On the commencement of the cold season, when the snow begins to accumulate among the mountains, all the inhabitants quit the neighbourhood of Bhadrinath, and take up their residence at this place. Adjoining the priest's house is a temple of Nara Singh, one of the incarnations of Vishnu. It was placed here by a Brahmin of the Josi (Jyotish) class, and the town has since borne its appellation in honour of the idol. Here are also small temples with statues of Vishnu, Ganesa, Surya, and Nau Devi.\n\nThe sides of the mountains in\nthis vicinity are overspread with forests of oak, while their summits are covered with a species of fir. At a village called Sellang, belonging to Bhadrinath, the whole scarp of the mountain, from the base to near the summit, is laid out in fields of wheat, barley, and other species of grain. (Raper, &c.)\n\n**Joudpoor, (Yuddhapur, the City of War).**\u2014An extensive Rajpoot principality, in the province of Ajmeer, of which it occupies the whole central and eastern quarters. The ancient name was Marwar, Joudpoor or Joodipoor, being merely a subdivision of that portion of Ajmeer; and the rajah is occasionally called the Marwar, or Rhatore Rajah. The dominions of this potentate are very extensive, but the boundaries are undefined. The town of Amerkote in Sinde, within 30 miles of the Indus, is in his possession; and on the east his territories comprehend the city of Meerita or Meerat. On the north they are bounded by Bicauere and Jesselmere; on the south by the province of Gujrat and Odeypoor; on the east by the dominions of Jynagur. When Raidun Khan, a Baboochee chief, established himself in Rahdunpoor, on the north-western frontiers of the Gujrat province, a Joudpoor detachment held possession of Putteypoor, a small fort two miles west from Rahdunpoor.\n\nThe southern, south-eastern, and eastern frontiers of Joudpoor are fertile; and being watered with streams that flow from the mountains, they yield wheat, barley, and other kinds of grain common in India: the cultivators are principally Jauts. The country also contains lead mines. On account of the sandy nature of the soil, which renders the road impassable for carriages, the trade is carried on by camels and bullocks, which are of a superior size, and in great demand all over India. The trade to this country from Surat passes chiefly through Gujrat and Ahmedabad; from Tatta, through Sinde and Jesselmere; and from the Deccan, by Mewar and Kotah. The town of Pawlee is the greatest commercial mart in this part of Rajpootana.\n\nThe imports into Joudpoor consist of cloth, shawls, spices, opium, rice, sugar, steel, and iron. The exports are salt, camels, bullocks, and horses. The latter are strong, heavy, and of a good stature; and the breed of cattle in general is excellent. The principal inhabitants of Joudpoor are Rhatore Rajpoots, who are a brave, handsome race of men, of the purest castes, which are the Sesodya, the Cutcheva, the Addah, and the Bawtee. The country is described as having, in former times, been much more populous than at present.\n\nMaha Raja Jeswunt Singh, one of Aurungzebe's best generals, was rajah of this country. When he died, near Cabul, in 1581, Aurungzebe gave orders forcibly to convert his children, in defending whom most part of their Rajpoot attendants perished. He expelled the family from the fort, and compelled them to take refuge in the hills and woods; such was the reward the family of one of his most faithful generals received. The family, on the death of Aurungzebe, regained possession, his grandson, Ajeet Singh, termed the hereditary zemindar of Joudpoor by the historian Bradut Khan, having rebelled and destroyed the mosques which the emperor had erected. The existing Rajah of Joudpoor, named Maun Singh, may be considered as one of the most powerful native princes in India; although, on account of internal feuds, he, like most other Rajpoot chiefs, is occasionally compelled to pay tribute to Dowlet Row Sindia and other Maharatta depredators. (G. Thomas, Scott, Macnardo, Rennel, Broughton, &c.)\n\n**Joudpoor.\u2014A Rajpoot town in the province of Ajmeer, the capital of the Rhatore Rajah of Joudpoor's dominions, 280 miles S. S.

E.\n\nJuggernauth, (Jagatnatha, the Lord of the World).\u2014A celebrated place of Hindoo worship on the sea-coast of Orissa, district of Cuttack, and esteemed the most sacred of all their religious establishments. Lat. 19\u00b0. 49'. N. Long. 86\u00b0. 5'. E. This pagoda is situated a few miles to the N. E. of the Chilka Lake, close to the sea-shore, and is a shapeless mass of building, no way remarkable, except as an object of Hindoo veneration. The country around is extremely sterile, the temple and town being encompassed with low sand hills. From the sea the temple forms an excellent land mark on a coast without any discriminating object for navigators. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, this place is described as follows:\n\n\"In the town of Pursettem, on the banks of the sea, stands the temple of Jagnant; near to which are the images of Kishen, his brother, and their sister, made of sandal wood, which are said to be 4000 years old.\"\n\nIn 1734, while Mahommed Tuckee was deputy-governor of Orissa, on the part of Shujah ud Deen, the Nabob of Bengal, the Rajah of Pursettom carried away the idol Juggernaut beyond the boundaries of Orissa, and placed it on a mountain, which exploit injured the revenue of that province to the amount of nine lacks of rupees per annum, being the average amount of the annual collections from the pilgrims.\n\nThe concourse of pilgrims to this temple is so immense, that at 50 miles distance its approach may be known by the quantity of human bones which are strewn by the way. Some old persons come to die at Juggernaut, and many measure the distance by their length on the ground. When it is first perceived the multitude of pilgrims shout, and fall on the ground to worship it. The vicinity of Juggernaut to the sea, and the arid nature of the soil, assist to prevent the contagion which would otherwise be produced.\n\nThe throne of the idol Juggernaut is placed on a stupendous car, or moveable tower, about 60 feet high, resting on wheels, which indent the ground deeply, as they turn under the ponderous machine. He is accompanied by two other idols, his brother Bakaram, and his sister Shubndra, who sit on thrones nearly of equal height. Attached to the tower are six cables, of the size and length of a ship's, by which the people draw it along; and upon the car are the priests and attendants of the idol. Both the walls of the temple and sides of the machine are covered with indecent sculptures.\n\nThe idol is a carved block of wood, having a frightful visage painted black, with a distended mouth of a bloody colour; the other two are of a white and yellow colour. As the tower proceeds along devotees throw themselves under the wheels, and are crushed to death. The followers of Brahma are not in general addicted to the worship of dead men's bones; but at Juggernaut they have a bone of Krishna, which is considered as a most precious and venerable relic; so much so, that few persons are allowed to see it. The appellation of Juggernaut (Jagat Natha, lord of the world) is merely one of the numerous names of Vishnu, the preserving power, according to the Brahminical theology.\n\nWhen the province of Cuttack was conquered from the Maharattas in 1803, the British succeeded to all their rights as sovereigns, and consequently to the revenue, derived by their predecessors from the resort of Hindoo pilgrims to Juggernaut. By a regulation of the Bengal government, in 1809, the superintend-\nance of the temple, its interior economy, and the control of the priests, officers, and servants attached to it, were vested in the Rajah of Khoordah, who was directed on all occasions to be guided by the recorded rules and institutions of the temple, or by ancient and established usage. In this charge the Rajahs of Khoordah are to continue, so long as they act with propriety.\n\nThe sum realized at the temple of Juggernaut, from the 1st of May, 1806, to the 30th of April, 1807, amounted to 117,490 sicca rupees, which is considerably less than that which the Company derive from the resort of pilgrims to Gayah, in Bahar. The annual expenditure is computed at 56,000 sicca rupees. To provide for this expenditure, in addition to the established endowments, consisting of lands and villages, an allowance of 20 per cent. on the net receipts, arising from the tax on pilgrims, is granted by the British government.\n\nFor the purpose of preventing persons either clandestinely or forcibly entering any where but at the places established for admission, there is a strong barrier made by a hedge of prickly bamboos, where access is not prevented by small branches of rivers; and there is a guard of soldiers placed to prevent their entering the town or temple until they have paid the pilgrim tax, for which purpose persons liable to the tax are divided into the following classes:\n\n1st. The Laut Jattries. Of this class those coming from the north pay 10 rupees, and those from the south six rupees, with free access to the temple for 30 days.\n\n2d. The Neem Lauls. From the north five, from the south three rupees; access 10 days.\n\n3d. The Bhurrungs, either from north or south, pay two rupees; access four days.\n\n4th. The Punj Tirthees. This class comprehends persons of low caste, who pay two rupees, whether from the north or south. They are not allowed to enter the temple, but are permitted to perform the customary ceremonies on the outside of it for 16 days. It is optional with all persons entitled to visit the interior of the temple to enrol themselves under whichever class they may prefer, on payment of the prescribed rate of tax.\n\nIn conformity with long-established usage the following description of persons are exempted from the payment of the tax on pilgrims at Juggernaut, viz. Bryraghics, Soonyassies, Dundies, Brihmacharies, Mohunts, Gosains, Khomarties, and Nagas, who are all devotees and religious persons. The inhabitants born in the province of Cuttack, within the Bytnmee and the Ganjam rivers, which is the holy land of Juggernaut, are also exempted; as are likewise all persons who have resided with their families for a period of 10 years within the said limits. Individuals who carry Ganges water to Juggernaut, and actually pour it over the idol, and persons resorting to the town of Juggernautpoor for trade, or any other purpose except pilgrimage, also escape the tax: but these last are prohibited during the 12 days while the great festival of the Ruth Jatra continues. Pilgrims in a state of actual poverty, on declaring their condition to be such under prescribed ceremonies, are allowed access to the temple for three days.\n\nAmong the voluminous documents respecting this pagoda, published by order of parliament in 1813, there is no official estimate of the number of pilgrims resorting annually to this place, and the revenue produced furnishes no data, so many classes being exempted. Dr. Carey is of opinion, that on the lowest calculation 1,200,000 persons attend annually, of whom many never return. The town adjacent to the temple is Pur-sottom; and to it merchants, traders, and others resorting to the bazars and markets, have access, but not to the temple without permission. One of the most important periods of pil-\ngrimage is in March, when the Dole Jatra takes place; and the other in July, when the Ruth Jatra is celebrated.\n\nA road from Calcutta, in the direction of Juggernaut, had long been an object highly desirable, considered merely in respect to the reputed sanctity of the temple; it was, however, more essential, in a military point of view, for the purpose of affording a communication between the provinces immediately dependent on Bengal and the territories subject to the presidency at Madras. It happened, indeed, that in 1819 Rajah Sookmoy Roy, an opulent Hindoo inhabitant of Calcutta, offered to contribute one and a half lacks of rupees (16,000l.) towards the accomplishment of this object, the road when completed to be designated by his name. He died soon after the payment of the money into the treasury; but the undertaking has been prosecuted in conjunction with his heirs.\n\nOrissa, where this temple is situated, was one of the last conquests made by the Mahommedans, at a period when the fervour of their bigotry had much abated, which partly accounts for the duration of this edifice.\n\nTravelling distance from Calcutta, 311 miles; from Nagpoor, 500; from Benares, 512; from Madras, 719; from Delhi, 910; and from Bombay, 1052 miles. (Parliamentary Reports and other Documents, C. Buchanan, Stewart, Wilford, &c.)\n\nJukai.\u2014A small town in the province of Sinde, situated on the brow of a hill about one-third of a mile from the River Indus. Lat. 25\u00b0 N. on the road from Tatta to Hyderabad. Opposite to this place the breadth of the river is two-thirds of a mile, with five fathoms depth of water.\n\nJulgam.\u2014A large village in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Bejapoor, 35 miles S. W. from Poonah. Lat. 18\u00b0 16' N. Long. 74\u00b0 27' E.\n\nJulmee.\u2014A considerable village in the province of Malwah, 47 miles S. by E. from Kotah. Lat. 24\u00b0 35' N. Long. 76\u00b0 4' E. In the vicinity of this place there is much cultivation of wheat and of the poppy.\n\nJumbosier River, (Jamblusira).\u2014A river in the province of Gujrat, which rises in the district of Champaneer, and after a short course falls into the Gulf of Cambay.\n\nJumbosier, (Jamblusira).\u2014A town in the province of Gujrat, district of Broach, 28 miles N. from the town of Broach. Lat. 22\u00b0 5' N. Long. 72\u00b0 58' E. A considerable trade is carried on with Bombay and other places, the exports consisting of cotton, grain, oil, and piece goods. The tide rises from five to six fathoms. This town and district belong to the Maharatta Peshwa.\n\nJumna River, (Yamuna).\u2014The source of this river has never been accurately explored; but it probably is not more remote than that of the Ganges, which rises on the south side of the great Himalaya ridge of mountains. Through the province of Serinagur it flows south, in a line nearly parallel to the Ganges; from which, at the village of Gurndwar, Lat. 30\u00b0 22' N. it is only 40 miles distant, and has as broad a stream. In this part of its course it abounds with fish, but the inhabitants are at no pains to catch them.\n\nThe Jumna enters Hindostan Proper in the province of Delhi, and proceeds south nearly in a line with the Ganges, at the distance of from 50 to 75 miles from each other, until they gradually join at Allahabad, when the Jumna, although little inferior in magnitude, has its name absorbed by the larger and more holy stream. Including the windings the length of its course may be estimated at 780 miles.\n\nThe Jumna is only a useful barrier to the British territories during the rainy season, when military operations are, from the general state of the country, almost impracticable. It is fordable in several places above\nAgra before the 1st of October; and cannot be looked upon as a boundary of any strength above its junction with the Chumbul, 10 miles below Etaweh, for more than a few weeks in the wet season. From Calpeo to its junction with the Ganges there is no obstruction, and only one place between Kalpy and Etaweh where, in the dry season, the passage is rendered in some degree difficult by a bank of limestone, which it was the intention of the British government during the Marquis Wellesley's administration to have removed. (Malcolm, Raper, Foster, 8th Register, &c.)\n\n**Junagur.**\u2014A town possessed by independent native chiefs, in the province of Gujrat. Lat. 21\u00b0. 48'. N. Long. 70\u00b0. 33'. N.\n\nThe Baloochee chiefs of Junagur sprung from the same tribe as the Nabobs of Rahdunpoor. By an agreement executed in 1808 Haumed Khan Bahander, the governor of the city of Junagur, engaged with the Bombay government not to permit, instigate, or connive at, any act of piracy by any person under his authority, and also to abstain from plundering vessels in distress. A free and open commerce to be permitted to all British vessels paying the regulated duties. (Treaties, &c.)\n\n**Jungypoor,** (Jangalpur). \u2014 A town in the province of Bengal, district of Rajeshy, 17 miles N. by W. from Moorshedabad. Lat. 24\u00b0. 28'. N. Long. 88\u00b0. 13'. E.\n\nThis is the greatest silk station in the possession of the East India Company; the others being Cossimbazar, Mauldah, Banleah, Commercolly, Radnagore, and Rungpoor. The first attempt made to establish a silk manufacture was at Budge-budge, below Calcutta, and did not succeed. The buildings here were erected in 1773, and in 1803 about 3000 persons were employed. They use the Italian method of spinning, which was introduced so early as 1762, by some natives of Italy, sent over for that purpose by the Company. The worms are bred by women and children, and the cocoons purchased by the East India Company.\n\nThe mulberry tree is the oriental. It is dwarfish, and the leaves but indifferent, to which is attributed a degeneracy in the breeds that have been introduced from foreign countries. The China mulberry was tried, but it did not succeed, from the dryness of the soil. The quantity produced is capable of being increased to any amount. In 1802 the investment stood the Company in five and one-eight rupees per pound. There are many other places where the natives rear the silk-worm, and have adopted the Italian method of spinning; but the Company do not purchase this silk. The employment is said to have no deleterious effect, and is certainly very advantageous, as very young children are capable of assisting. (Lord Valentia, &c.)\n\n**Junglebarry,** (Jangalbati). \u2014 A town in the province of Bengal, district of Mymunsingh, 60 miles N. E. from Dacca. Lat. 24\u00b0. 27'. N. Long. 90\u00b0. 42'. E.\n\n**Junkseylon,** (Jan Sylan). \u2014 An island situated on the west coast of the Malay Peninsula, between the latitudes of 7\u00b0. 56', and 8\u00b0. 27'. N. From the mainland it is separated by a narrow isthmus of sand, about a mile in length, which is covered only at high water, the tide rising on the springs about 10 feet. This island is in length about 40 miles, by 15 in breadth, and has several small islands adjacent from one to six miles in circumference. Sixteen miles east there is another, named Pulo Pinjang, or Long Island, being 23 miles in length, by eight in breadth, and divided from the main by a strait, having two fathoms water in the nar-\nrowest part. On the north side of Junkseylon is a harbour, named Popra, to which a vessel drawing 20 feet water may have access at the springs over a mud bar; and the anchorage round the island is generally good, with a muddy bottom.\n\nJunkseylon has no high hill or considerable river; but there are several marshy creeks, covered with mangroves, the inhabitants on purpose keeping the sea-coast in a jungly state to guard against invasion. Their vessels consist only of a few small prows and canoes, which proceed up the creeks to the well-cultivated plains in the centre of the island where rice abounds. The chief town, or rather village, is Terrowah, consisting of about 80 houses; the inhabitants of the whole island are estimated at 12,000. Bullocks and bulldoors are used here for labour, but there are no horses. Persons of consequence travel on tame elephants, which are brought from Mergui, there being none on the island in a wild state. The other animals are wild hogs and deer, a few tame goats and poultry; but no sheep, domestic dogs, nor cats. The heats here are never violent; the rains begin in July, and continue to November, with frequent intermissions; after which fine weather succeeds, accompanied by cold northeasterly winds at night.\n\nBefore the establishment of Prince of Wales Island the Buggess prows resorted to Junkseylon in great numbers, and brought various mixed cargoes to sell for tin. These goods usually consisted of checkered cloth called Buggess cambays, made on the Island of Celebes; Java painted cloths and painted handkerchiefs generally made from the long cloths of Hindostan; Java gongs, brass pots, and other utensils of brass, made on that island; China and Java tobacco, various porcelain and other smaller articles. The tin produced here is raised by the natives, and smelted by a Chinese, who farms the privilege from government; in 1782 the quantity exported amounted to 500 tons annually, but has since much diminished, owing to the unsettled state of the country. Pieces of tin, weighing about three pounds, pass here for money; and the governor, like all Malay princes, is the chief merchant.\n\nThe inhabitants of Junkseylon, although they generally understand the Malay language, speak the Siamese. In features they resemble the Malays, but with a Chinese cast of countenance, and are slender and well made. At Terrowah, the principal town, there is a pagoda built of timber, and covered with palm leaves, where about 20 priests or talapoins officiate, who subsist on charity. The establishment of Prince of Wales Island gave a great blow to the trade of this station, it having become the emporium for this part of the Malay coast. Country ships from Calcutta on their voyage eastward call at this place, and dispose of a few chests of opium and some piece goods, in return for which they receive tin and elephants' teeth. From Junkseylon tin, bird nests, biche de mer, sepun, and elephant's teeth, are exported to Prince of Wales Island; from whence opium and piece goods are imported.\n\nThe French attempted to form a settlement here so early as 1688. Prior to 1785 this island formed part of the Siamese dominions. In that year the Birmanas attacked it with a fleet and army, the latter marching by land; but after a successful commencement they were compelled to retreat with heavy loss. In 1810 they were more prosperous, as they effected the conquest of the island, and sent all the inhabitants into slavery in Pegne. At that period the Siamese were assembling a force to attempt its recapture, the result of which has not been ascertained.

E.\n\nJUSHPOOR.\u2014A small district in the province of Gundwana, bounded on the north and east by the province of Bahar, and situated about the 22d degree of north latitude. In the time of Aurungzebe it was formally annexed to the Soubah of Allahabad, although but in nominal subjection to the Mogul empire. It is a barren, mountainous, unproductive territory, and continues possessed by independent zemindars.\n\nJUSHPOOR.\u2014A town in the province of Gundwana, district of Jushpoor, of which it is the capital. Lat. 22\u00b0. 30'. N. Long. 81\u00b0. 7'. E.\n\nJUTWAR, (Jhutwar).\u2014A small district in the province of Gujrat, situated about the 23d degree of north latitude. It extends along the Banass River, near its junction with the Gulf of Cutch; and is possessed by the tribe of Jhuts, who are of Sindean origin, the caste being common both in Cutch and Sinde. They are a very turbulent predatory race, and carry their ravaging excursions to a great distance from their own precincts. At present they possess the Mahommedan religion, and in their manners resemble the Balooch tribes; but, they do not intermarry with the Mahommedans of Werrear. They kill cows without scruple, and eat the flesh of oxen in preference to any other.\n\nAlthough the Jhuts are plunderers by birth and profession, yet many parts of their own district are populous and well cultivated, the tribe not being deficient in industry. They have a race of slaves who not only perform menial offices, but attend them on their predatory excursions. These slaves they brought with them on their first settlement, and are named Sumchja, which is the name of an inferior tribe, formerly very numerous in Sinde. Hummer Khan and Omar Khan, are the principal Jhut chieftains, and as well as their relations are frequently at war with each other; but on occasion of public danger, the whole family unites, and private dissension ceases.\n\nThe women exercise considerable influence over the men, which is rarely found among Mahommedans, and can when she chooses leave her husband and marry another. When this change is determined on, she assembles all her female acquaintances and attacks her husband, demolishes his furniture, and persecutes him until he acquiesces in a separation. The Jhut women are plain in their persons, and dress in coarse black cloths, which do not improve their appearance; yet, they are held in great respect by the men, and a traveller cannot have a better protector from these marauders, than one their females. (Macnurdo, \u00a7c.)\n\nJYAPOOR, (Jayapoor).\u2014A town possessed by independent zemindars, in the province of Orissa, 73 miles N. W. from Vizagapatam. Lat. 18\u00b0. 23'. N. Long. 82\u00b0. 46'. N.\n\nJYENAGUR, (Jayanagar).\u2014A Rajpoot principality, situated in the eastern extremity of the province of Ajmeer. The dominions of this state are bounded on the north by the district of Hurrianaah, in the Delhi province; on the north-east by Alvar; on the east by Karowly and Bhurtpoor; on the south by Kotah, Boondee, and Mewar; south-west by Kishengur; west by the district of Ajmeer and the Joudpoor territories; and on the N. W. by the country of Bicanere. In length, from north to south, the dominions of Jyenagur may be estimated at 150 miles by 70 from east to west; but it rarely happens, that the\nwhole of this space is under actual subjection to the Jyenagur Rajah.\n\nThe eastern, north-eastern, southern, and south-western parts of this country, produce wheat, cotton, tobacco, and in general whatever is common to other parts of India. The country is in general watered from wells. The northern and north-western districts being sandy, are not so plentifully supplied with moisture as the central parts; but in the mountainous territory there are many streams. The Rajah is in possession of Sambher, which yields plenty of salt, as do likewise the districts of Senganah and Berat; and in addition to these, the country produces copper, alum, blue stone, and verdigrise. In most parts of Jyenagur there are good cattle, but not equal in quality to those of Joudpoor; and in several of the towns there are manufactories of cloth, swords, and matchlocks.\n\nThe imports are fine cloth, tissue, the manufactures of Benares, and shawls from Cashmere. From Gujrat and Tatta are supplied opium, lead, and sheet copper, and from Persia fruits and horses. The caravans formerly passed by Bicanere, but more recently through Jesselmere and Joudpoor.\n\nIn the southern part of the Jyenagur territories, the cultivators are named Meenas, and are of the Khetri tribe, but not stiled Rajpoots, the latter thinking it derogatory to follow any profession but that of arms. The Rajpoots, however, frequently rent large farms, but employ meenas to cultivate them. In the districts of Kotah and Bondee, which are to the south of Jyenagur, the meenas inhabiting the hills and jungles devote themselves exclusively to thieving, and eat meat and drink spirits without scruple. In the other quarters of this state, the great mass of cultivators are Jauts, who are kept by the Rajpoots in the strictest obedience. The latter follow the practice so general in Rajputana, of occasionally putting their female offspring to death.\n\nThe territory of Jyenagur is compact, and comprehends the most populous and fertile part of the Ajmeer province. It abounds with fortresses, some of them the strongest in Hindostan, and deemed by the natives impregnable, particularly that which defends the capital and Rantampoor. Besides these, there are a great number of small forts scattered over the country, and half of the villages are surrounded by walls and ditches. The whole dominions are supposed capable of yielding a revenue of 120 lacks of rupees per annum, under a proper government and cultivation; two advantages they have never yet experienced. The respective Rajpoot chiefs, for the most part, hold their lands on the feudal system of tenure.\n\nThe tribe of Rajpoots to which the Jyenagur family belong is named Cutchwa, and is of the Suryabans, or children of the sun; being descended from Rama, the celebrated Rajah of Oude's second son, named Cush. From the latter, the Jyenagur chronologers reckon 210 rajahs, in succession to Prithi Raj, who succeeded to the throne in 1502. The Holkar family claim a tribute from this state, and it is annually subject to the visits of Maharatta depredators; who plunder the country, and exact contributions from the Rajpoots, although much inferior to them as soldiers, and individually despised by them. Such is the effect of the internal dissensions, which pervade all the Rajpoot states in Hindostan. (Broughton, G. Thomas, Remel, Hunter, &c.)\n\nJyenagur.\u2014A Rajpoot city in the province of Ajmeer, the capital of a principality of the same name. Lat. 26\u00b0 56'. N. Long. 73\u00b0 40'. E.\n\nThis capital was founded by the celebrated Rajah Jeysing, in the reign of Mahommed Shah, which had the effect not unusual in Hindostan of changing the name of the\nprovince to that of the capital. The prior metropolis was the city of Amber. At that period the city of Jycnagur was in a high state of improvement, and the seat of science, Rajah Jeyising being a great encourager of learning, and the founder of several observatories for astronomical researches.\n\nThe town of Jycnagur is handsome, and reckoned the most regularly built in Hindostan. The houses are of stone, and the streets, which are large and spacious, intersect each other at right angles. A citadel, which commands the town, is built upon a steep rock. Around it a chain of fortification extends four miles in circumference. This place is the great mart for horses from Persia and the northern provinces of Hindostan.\n\nThe present rajah possesses the city, but not much territory, part having been seized by his feudatories, the vassals of his family, and part occupied by the Maharattas, who annually levy contributions.\n\nIn A.D. 1798, after the treacherous massacre of Mr. Cherry, and the other English gentlemen at Benares, Vizier Ali fled to Jycnagur, intending eventually to seek a refuge with the sovereign of Cabul. The Marquis Wellesley being anxious to bring the assassin to punishment, dispatched Colonel Collins as ambassador to the Rajah Pertaub Singh to procure his surrender; to accomplish which purpose he authorized him to expend to the amount of three lacks of rupees. A long negotiation ensued, in which the rajah expressed great reluctance to infringe the rights of hospitality, even towards so great a villain; but the spirited remonstrances of the ambassador, backed by the seasonable distribution of the money, effected his capture, under the stipulations that he should neither be put to death nor confined in chains. He has ever since been confined in one of the bomb proofs in Fort William, in a species of cage, open on all sides, and there he still continues; but it is now desirable, as no danger need be apprehended from his liberation, that a species of punishment so obnoxious to British feelings should cease.\n\nTravelling distance from Agra 136 miles; from Delhi, 156; from Oojain, 285; from Bombay, 740; and from Calcutta, 975.

Balgaum; the chief Prethi Raj, a Coolie.\n8. Ramingpoor; the, chief Prethi Raj, a Coolie.\n\nTherah may be considered as the present capital of the Kakreze, the greatest part of which was formerly under the Rajpoots of Deodhur, from whose authority it was wrested by Chilhabhooy, a Coolie, who fixed his residence at Therah. Kakreze was increased to the extent of 84 villages in the time of Koombajee his son, and it afterwards descended to Jemajee, who raised his family a step by marrying a Rajore Rajpootnee (a female Rajpoot.)\n\nJemajee reigned about 50 years ago, at which time a great many Coolies were subject to his government, but, as is their nature, very refractory. Many years before his death he had been in the practice of concealing himself so privately, that, excepting his wife, no person knew of his being alive. A sham funeral was performed, which invigled the Coolies into acts of rebellion, and then he made his appearance, and inflicted a severe punishment. This had happened so frequently, that for three years after his death the fact was not credited. His wife Raj Bhye was his successor, and so much esteemed by Futteh Singh Guicowar, that he confided to her the charge of Kakreze and Puttenwara until his death, which happened about 45 years ago.\n\nThe town of Oon, like the rest of this district, is now occupied by a petty independent chief. Deodhur is the place of most strength, and can muster from three to 400 cavalry well mounted, and nearly 2000 infantry on urgent emergencies. In this district the dead are buried without the lamentations which usually accompany funeral obsequies in Gujrat. (Macnurdo, &c.)\n\nKalbergau, (Callberg.)\u2014A town in the province of Beeder, 105 miles W. from Hyderabad, and the capital of a district of the same name. Lat. 17\u00b0. 17'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 8'. E.\n\nThis is now a town of little note, but was famous in ancient times, having been the capital both of a Hindoo and Mahommedan sovereignty. Rajahs of Kalbergah are mentioned by Ferishta as independent princes when the Dekkan was invaded by Alla ud Deen in A.D. 1295; and, when the founder of the Bhanence dynasty erected the standard of independence, in 1347, this was his capital. (Ferishta, Scott, &c.)\n\nKalkoons, or Turkey Isles.\u2014A cluster of small rocky islands, surrounded by shoals innumerable, situated between the sixth and seventh degrees of south latitude, and 115th and 116th of east longitude.\n\nKalpy, (Culpi).\u2014A town in the province of Agra, situated on the S.W. side of the River Jumna. Lat. 26\u00b0. 10'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 48'. E. The\ndistrict attached to this place, in 1582, is by Abul Fazel described as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Calpee, containing 16 mahals, measurement 300,029 bengahs. Revenue 49,456,730 dams. Seyurghal 1,078,292 dams. This sircar furnishes 1,540 cavalry, 30 elephants, and 34,000 infantry.\"\n\nKalpy is a place of considerable trade, and the entrepot for the transportation of cotton from the western and southern provinces into the Company's territories. The Mahomedans first penetrated to this quarter about A.D. 1203, and here was fought, in 1765, the first action between the British (under General Carnac) and the Maharattas. The latter came to the assistance of Sujah ud Dowlah, but after a weak resistance were totally routed, and compelled to recross the Jumna with the utmost precipitation.\n\nIn 1804 among the dependents on the Peshwa's government was Nana Govind Row of Calpee, whose valuable district of Muhoba lies in the centre of Bundelcund, and had not been conquered by Ali Bahauder. It was nevertheless seized by Rajah Himmut Bahauder as part of his Jaidad under the British, which induced the Calpee Chief to unite his forces with Shumshere Bahauder in opposition to the British. In consequence of this conduct the fort and district of Calpee, and some other districts on the northern frontier of Bundelcund, which had been held by this chief as a tributary of the Peshwa's, were occupied by British troops; but, by a subsequent arrangement, after Nana Govind Row had submitted to the views of government, all his districts, with the exception of Calpee, and a few villages to the northward on the banks of the Jumna, were restored to him.\n\nBy this treaty, concluded the 23rd Oct. 1806, Nana Govind Row agreed to cede in perpetuity the city and district of Calpee in the province of Agra, and the several villages situated on the right bank of the Jumna between Calpee and Raypoor. As an equivalent the British government granted to the Nana certain villages, and their lands, in the province of Bundelcund, in addition to what was left him of his old territory, the whole yielding a revenue of 145,000 rupees per annum. The revenue of the country ceded to the British was 76,000 rupees, and that transferred to the Nana amounted to about the same. It was agreed that over his whole country he was to be considered as the independent and uncontrolled ruler, and exempt from every future claim or demand on the part of the British government.\n\nAs one-third of the diamond mines at Panuah had from ancient times been committed by his highness the Peshwa to the care of Nana Govind Row, it was arranged that the Nana should not be molested in the possession of the said portion of the mines in question, and the British government accordingly renounced all claim thereto in his favour.\n\nTravelling distance from Lucknow 98 miles S.W.; from Agra, 160; from Benares, 239; and from Calcutta, 699 miles. (MSS. Treaties, Remmel, &c., &c.)\n\nKameh, (Cama).\u2014An Afghan district in the province of Cabul, situated between the 34th and 35th degrees of north latitude, and extending along the Kameh, or Cabul River. The chief town is Adenagur.\n\nCanary Isles.\u2014A cluster of small islands lying off the north coast of Mysol, about the 130th degree of east longitude. They are covered with trees, but uninhabited. Good water may be procured at the south end of the great Canary Island. These islands produce a species of nut full of oil, and as large as a small almond. (Forrest, &c.)\n\nKandang Wesse.\u2014A district extending along the south coast of the Island of Java, and situated between the seventh and eighth degrees of south latitude.\nKANGELANG ISLE.\u2014An irregularly-shaped island, surrounded by a cluster of smaller ones, and innumerable shoals, situated between the sixth and seventh degrees of south latitude, and the 115th and 116th of east longitude. The length of the principal island may be estimated at 25 miles, by eight the average breadth.\n\nKANGRAH.\u2014A fortress surrounded by a small hilly and woody district, in the province of Lahore, situated about the 32d degree of north latitude. In 1582 Abul Fazel describes the place as follows:\n\n\"Nagercote is a city placed on a mountain, with a fort, named Kangrah. In the vicinity of this city, upon a lofty mountain, is a place called Maham-ey, which they (the Hindoos) consider as one of the works of the divinity, and come in pilgrimages to it from great distances, thereby obtaining the accomplishment of their wishes. It is most wonderful that, in order to effect this, they cut out their tongues, which grow again in the course of two or three days, and sometimes in a few hours. Physicians believe, that when the tongue is cut it will grow again; but nothing except a miracle can effect it so speedily as is here mentioned.\"\n\nThe modern territory of Kangrah, or Catochin, is limited on the north and north-west by Hurreepoor; on the east by Chambay; on the south by Calowr; and on the west by Punjab. In 1783 its revenue was estimated at seven lacks of rupees.\n\nAfter the conquest of Serinagur, in 1803, by the Nepaulese, their army proceeded in the direction of Nepaul, but were stopped in their progress by this fortress, which then belonged to Rajah Sansar Chund. It is situated on a steep mountain, about 30 miles to the west of the Beyab River, is well supplied with water, and contains sufficient ground to yield subsistence to the garrison, consisting of three or 4000 men. It has since been ceded to the Seiks, who were called in as auxiliaries, and repulsed the Nepaul army. In 1808 it was undergoing a siege by the troops of the Nepaul Rajah, the result of which has not been ascertained, but they had reduced it to great distress, having lain before it two years. At that time Gholam Mahommed, the Rohillah, who fought against the British in 1794, was in the pay of the Kangrah Rajah. (Abul Fazel, Raper, 11th Register, &c.)\n\nKANJEE.\u2014A small town in the province of Gujrat, district of Werrear, situated a few miles south from Rahdunpoor. This place contains about 250 houses, and is surrounded by a ditch eight feet deep, and sloping from 12 to one foot broad at the bottom. On the inner bank a small breast-work is thrown up, and a few matchlocks stationed behind it are sufficient to keep off the predatory cavalry, with which this part of Gujrat swarms. There are two or three large tanks here, but during the dry season the water is brackish. (Macnardo, &c.)\n\nKANOGE, (Canyaeculja).\u2014A district in the province of Agra, extending along the east side of the Ganges. The soil is generally sandy, but well cultivated, with abundance of mango clumps, and but little jungle. When the rains have been deficient the crops fail, except where the cultivators, with much labour, water the fields from wells. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Kanoge, containing 30 mahals; measurement, 2,776,673 beegahs; revenue, 52,584,607 damms. This sircar furnishes 3765 cavalry, and 188,350 infantry.\"\n\nKANOGE.\u2014A town of great antiquity and celebrity in the province of Agra, situated on the west of the Gauges. Lat. 27\u00b0. 5'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 52'. E. That river is now about two miles distant, but a canal has been cut, which makes a bend towards the town, and brings the sacred\nstream close to the citadel. The town at present consists of but one street, but, for an extent of six miles, the mixture of small pieces of brick, and the occasional vestiges of a building, point out the site of this ancient capital of Hindostan. Here are the tombs of two Mahommedan saints, who lie in state under two mausoleums on an elevation covered with trees. From the terrace, which surrounds them, is a pleasant view of the plain, covered with ruined temples and tombs, and everywhere little images are seen lying under the trees broken to pieces. No buildings of any consequence now remain, and the brick walls, which appear of no great antiquity, are going rapidly to decay. Ancient coins, of an irregular shape, are frequently found among the ruins, inscribed with sanscrit characters, and having sometimes the figure of a Hindoo deity on one side.\n\nKanoge, in the remote times of Hindoo history, was a place of great celebrity, and the capital of a powerful empire, which existed at the period of the Mahommedan invasion. The name Kanyakubja (Kanoge) is derived from the sanscrit Kanya, signifying a damsel, and Kubja, a spinal curve, and refers to a well-known story related in the Hindoo mythological poems. The language of Kanoge appears to form the ground-work of the modern Hindostani, known also by the appellation of Hindi, or Hindivi. Rajahs of Kanoge are mentioned by Ferishta so early as 1008; and it was conquered, though not permanently retained, by Mahmood of Ghizni, in A.D. 1018.\n\nTravelling distance from Agra 217 miles; from Lucknow, 75; from Delhi, 214; and from Calcutta, 719 miles. (Colebrooke, Lord Valentia, Rennel, Ramayon, &c.)\n\nKapini Isle, (Pulo Kapini, or Iron Wood Island).\u2014A small uninhabited island, about 25 miles in circumference, lying off the west coast of Sumatra, and situated nearly under the equator. In the charts it is usually named Batu, while to Batu the name of Mintaoon is erroneously assigned.\n\nKarab.\u2014A town belonging to the Maharattas, in the province of Gujrat, 17 miles S.E. from Ahmedabad. Lat. 22\u00b0. 46'. N. Long. 72\u00b0. 45'. E.\n\nKarakeeta Isle.\u2014A small island in the Eastern Seas, situated to the south of Sangir. Lat. 3\u00b0. 7'. N. Long. 125\u00b0. 25'. E. It is cultivated and inhabited.\n\nKarajee.\u2014A small town in the province of Bejapoor, 45 miles N.E. from Merritch. Lat. 17\u00b0. 26'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 28'. E. In this place are a considerable number of Mahommedans, who subsist mostly on alms, in a state of filth and sloth. These Mussulmaun devotees, although the most intolerant on the face of the earth, crave and take charity from all religions. (Moor, &c.)\n\nKarauw, (Caragrama).\u2014A town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Khandesh, district of Bejapoor. Lat. 21\u00b0. 54'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 33'. E.\n\nKarical, (Carica'a).\u2014A town on the sea-coast of the province of Tanjore, 50 miles E. by N. from the city of Tanjore. Lat. 10\u00b0. 55'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 54'. E. The territory around this place is extremely fertile, and produces abundance of rice; and salt is also made and exported.\n\nIn the Carnatic wars, from 1740 to 1763, Karical was a place of considerable importance, and strongly fortified. In 1760 it was taken from the French by Colonel Monson. At this period of history the French, by purchase and cession from the Tanjore government, had acquired districts round the fort, comprehending 113 villages; the revenue of which, with the customs of the port and town, produced 30,000 pagodas per annum. (Orme, Sonnerat, &c., &c.)\n\nKarnata.\u2014An ancient Hindoo geographical division, which com-\nprehended all the high table land in the south of India, situated above the Ghauts. By a fatality unexampled in the history of nations, it has lost its name, which has been transferred to adjacent provinces on the sea-coasts of India, under the appellations of Carnatic and Canara.\n\nThe common Canara, or Karnataca character and language, are used by the natives of all those countries, from Coimbetoor north to Balaky, near Beeder, and within the parallels of the Eastern Ghauts to the Western. This region comprehends the modern provinces of Mysore, Sera, Upper Bednore, Sounda, Goa, Adoni, Rachoor, Carnoul, the Doab of the Krishna, and Toombuddra; and a considerable part of the modern provinces of Bejaipoor and Beeder, as far as the source of the Krishna. The junction of the three languages\u2014the Telenga, the Maharatta, and the Canara, takes place somewhere about the city of Beeder, in the Deccan. The Haiga Brahmins in Canara consider the Karnataca as their proper tongue; and all accounts, or inscriptions on stone, whether in the vulgar language or in sanscrit, are written in the Karnataca character, which is nearly the same with the andray, or old writing of Telengana.\n\nThe principal rivers of the south of India, that have their rise on the table land of Karnata, are the Krishna, the Toombuddra, the Cauvery, and the Pennar; all of which, although rising within from 30 or 50 miles of the Malabar Coast, run eastward into the Bay of Bengal, proving a general declivity towards that quarter.\n\nIn the remote periods of Hindoo history Karnata existed as a powerful empire, which comprehended great part of the south of India; and, in the eighth century of the Christian era, is ascertained to have been governed by the Bellala Rayas; at which time Balagami, in the Mysore province, is said to have been the capital, and the Jain the prevalent religion of the kingdom. (MacKenzie, F. Buchanan, Wilks, Kennel, Colebrooke, &c.)\n\nKarouly, (Keruli).\u2014A town in the province of Agra, 70 miles S. W. from the city of Agra. Lat. 26\u00b0. 35'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. E.\n\nThis town is situated on the Puchperec, a small river with high perpendicular banks, which during the rainy season swells to a torrent, and on the other side is almost surrounded by deep and extensive ravines. The fort is in the centre of the town, which is surrounded by a good stone wall with bastions. The rajah is of the Rajpoot tribe of Jadoo, which formerly reigned at Biana. They have gradually been stripped of their best possessions by the Maharattas; the revenues of this little state not exceeding one and a half lacks of rupees, out of which the Peshwa claims a tribute of 20,000 rupees. The most productive part of its territory is a narrow valley, which extends 30 miles to the Bunmass River, and is scarcely a mile in breadth. (Broughton, &c.)\n\nKaweel, (Cavil).\u2014A large district in the Nizam's territories, in the province of Berar, situated principally between the 21st and 22d degrees of north latitude. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Kaweel, containing 46 mahals; revenue, 134,874,048 dams; seyurghal, 12,874,048 dams.\" The chief town is Ellichpoor, and the principal river the Poornah, by which it is intersected.\n\nKayns, (or Kiayns).\u2014In the intermediate space between Bengal, Aracan, Ava Proper, and the province of Munipoor, or Cassay, is an extensive mountainous and woody tract, occupied by many rude tribes. The most distinguished among these are called by the Birmans Kayns, but by themselves Kolonn; and many have, since the conquest of Aracan by the Birmans, been influenced to quit the mountains, and settle in the\nplains. They speak a dialect peculiar to themselves, and appear distinct from all the surrounding tribes. They are remarkable for simple honest industry and inoffensive manners, accompanied by the rudest notions respecting religion. They have no idea of a place of future reward and punishment, and deny the existence of sin in their country. They burn their dead, and collect the ashes, which, after certain ceremonies, are carried to a place of interment, and on the sod which covers them is laid a wooden image of the deceased. They believe their deity resides on the great mountain Gnowa, which the Birmanas have never yet invaded. When a Kayn dies within the jurisdiction of the Birmanas, the relations of the deceased always convey the urn and image of the departed person to this mountain, there to be deposited in the sacred earth. These people have no letters, nor any law except custom, to which the Birmanas leave them, never interfering in their municipal or social economy.\n\nThe females of this tribe have their faces tattooed all over in lines, mostly describing segments of circles, which gives them a most extraordinary and hideous appearance. (Symes, F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\n**KEDARNATH**, (Kedara Nath).\u2014A place of Hindoo pilgrimage in Northern Hindostan, situated in the province of Serinagur. Lat. 30\u00b0. 53'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 19'. E.\n\nThis place lies about 14 or 15 miles of direct distance to the W. N. W. of Bhadrinath; but the intermediate hills are inaccessible from snow; and travellers are obliged to make a circuitous route by the way of Josimath. The road to Kedarnath is much obstructed, and in many places leads over beds of snow, extending for several miles. By the time the pilgrimage to Kedarnath is completed, Bhadrinath is ready to receive visitors, who, having paid their devotions, return by the road of Nandaprayaga and Carnaprayaga, and thus conclude the grand circle of pilgrimage.\n\nThe ceremonies undergone here by the Hindoos differ in no respect from the customs usually observed at the other places of holy ablution. After washing away their impurities, the men whose fathers are dead, and those of the female sex who are widows, submit to the operation of tonsure. One day suffices for the observation of these rites, and very few remain more than two days; but endeavour to effect their retreat from the hills before the commencement of the periodical rains. (Raper, &c.)\n\n**KEEN-DUEN RIVER.**\u2014This is the great western branch of the Irawaddy or Ava River, and derives its name from the Kayn tribe\u2014the name signifying the Fountain of the Kayns. It arrives in the Birman country from the N. W. and separates it from the conquered province of Cassay. The Birmanas say it has its source in a lake three months' journey to the northward, and is navigable, as far as the Ava dominions extend, for vessels of burthen. The most distant town in the possession of the Birmanas on the banks of this river is Nakieung, where it joins the eastern branch of the Irawaddy; it is rather more than a mile broad. (Symes, F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\n**KEELAN ISLE.**\u2014A small island about 20 miles in circumference, lying off the western extremity of Ceram. Lat. 3\u00b0. 15'. S. Long. 127\u00b0. 55'. E. This island is inhabited, and well planted with cocoa nut and plantain trees.\n\n**KEERPOT**, (Cripo).\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Burdwan, 50 miles N. W. from Calcutta. Lat. 22\u00b0. 46'. N. Long. 87\u00b0. 44'. E. This is the seat of a commercial residency.\n\n**KEFFING ISLE.**\u2014An island about 45 miles in circumference, separated from the south-east end of the Island of Ceram by a narrow strait. Lat. 3\u00b0. 50'. S. Long. 130\u00b0. E.\n\n**KEDGEREE**, (Kijari).\u2014A village and bazar in the province of Bengal,\nsituated at the mouth of the Hooghly River, which here expands to a breadth of nearly nine miles across, 52 miles S. by W. from Calcutta, Lat. 21\u00b0. 55'. N. Long. 88\u00b0. 16'. E.\n\nThis is a much healthier station than Diamond Harbour; and ships of war, unless compelled by strong reasons, should never go higher up the river. Here a naval officer on the part of the Company is established, who makes daily reports to government of the ships that arrive and sail. During the rainy season ships sometimes lie here a long time, on account of the freshes of the river. On shore the country is a low, swampy, salt morass, and particularly pernicious to European constitutions. Many tropical fruits and other refreshments may be procured here.\n\nKelat, (Killa, the Fort).\u2014The capital of Balochistan, and the residence of its sovereign, Mahmood Khan. Lat. 29\u00b0. 6'. N. Long. 67\u00b0. 57'. E.\n\nThis town stands on a small hill, on the west side of a rich valley, about 12 miles in length, and not exceeding two in breadth, surrounded by lofty mountains, which in winter are covered with snow; but, in the summer, afford pasture for numerous flocks of fat-tailed sheep, camels, and goats.\n\nFrom its elevated situation, the town of Kelat, at a distance, has a prepossessing appearance, which does not improve on closer inspection. The streets are narrow and dirty, and the houses built of half-burned brick, the upper stories approaching each other across the street. The city is populous, and contains above 4000 houses; 400 of which are inhabited by the Babee Patan merchants and Hindoos. The latter are computed to exceed 500 in number, and receive great encouragement from the government, a small duty being levied for the support of their pagoda. The bazar is well supplied, and the town exhibits an appearance of trade and prosperity unusual in this miserable country. In the neighbourhood are many gardens producing various European fruits, but the proportion of ground capable of cultivation in this quarter is barely sufficient for the population, which in adverse seasons depends on Cutch Gundava for supplies of grain.\n\nThe city of Kelat is merely enclosed by a low mud wall, but the palace of the Khan, which stands on a high hill, commanding a complete view of the country, is considered by the natives impregnable. (Kincaid, Christie, &c.)\n\nKellamangalam, (Killa Mangalam, the Prosperous Fort).\u2014A small town in the ceded districts of the Mysore, annexed to the Barranahal. Lat. 12\u00b0. 35'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 5'. E. This place contains above 300 houses, and has a small fort with two reservoirs. In the neighbourhood the dry field forms by far the greater part of the arable land. Poppies are cultivated for the purpose of procuring opium. When the seed of this plant is allowed to ripen, an intoxicating liquor called post is composed from it, much used for inebriation both by the Mahomedans and Hindoos. Considerable numbers of cattle are also reared near Kellamangalam. The woods and wastes adjacent are much frequented by traders in grain called lumbadies, or brinjarries, who even in time of peace cannot entirely abstain from plunder.\n\nThe country from hence to Woragan Hully, distant seven miles, consists of low rocky hills overgrown with brush wood, and interspersed with considerable portions of arable ground. Of this the soil of the first quality forms one-fifth, of the second quality two-fifths, and of the third and fourth qualities each one-fifth. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nKelpoory, (Khelapuri).\u2014A small district in the province of Delhi, situated about the 29th degree of north latitude, and bounded on the north by the Kemaoon Mountains. The soil of this district is fertile, but it\nstill contains a great extent of land overgrown with extensive forests. When the Institutes of Acber were compiled, it appears to have been comprehended in the division of Sumbhalpoor; in 1801 it was ceded to the Company by the Nabob of Oude, and was annexed to the collectorship of Bareily.\n\nKelpoor.\u2014A town in the province of Delhi, 48 miles N. N. E. from Bareily, and the capital of a small district of the same name. Lat. 28\u00b0. 59'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 39'. E.\n\nKemaoon, (Camoon).\u2014A district in Northern Hindostan, situated principally between the 29th and 30th degrees of north latitude; the hilly part of which belongs to the Rajah of Nepaul, and the turrce, or lower part, to the British government, having been ceded in 1801 by the Nabob of Oude. The territory of this district is separated from that of Serinagur by a range of mountains, on which stands the village of Chiring. Lat. 36\u00b0. 6'. N.\n\nAfter passing this chain of hills the contrast is remarkable. The hills of Kemaoon appear to rise in a regular gentle acclivity from their bases, and the soil is of rich earth, giving birth to fine verdure and extensive forests. The country also divides into rather spacious valleys, rendered fertile by tillage, and the cultivation is more extended, and carried further up the hills than in Serinagur, with a greater population. On the frontier several of the villages are divided, one half belonging to Serinagur, and one half to Kemaoon, an arrangement which does not appear founded in sound policy. In this district are many small and rapid rivers, such as the Gaumathi, the Garuda Gunga, the Barrul, and the Cansila. Prior to 1791 the mountainous part of this district was subdued by the Nepaulese; and, in 1808, the expelled Rajah of Kemaoon resided at Rampoor as a tch-sildar (subordinate collector of the revenue), under the British government. In 1582 Abul Fazel describes the Kemaoon Mountains, and attributes to them a great many valuable articles which they do not produce:\u2014\"A part of the northern mountains of this soubah is called Kemaoon, where there are mines of gold, silver, lead, iron, orpiment, and borax. Here are also found abundance of musk deer, ketass cows, silk worms, falcons of various kinds, goats, horses, and plenty of honey.\"\n\nThe city of Almora is the capital both of the Kemaoon and the Almora districts. (Raper, Kirkpatrick, Abul Fazel, &c.)\n\nKenneri.\u2014A collection of remarkable caverns excavated in the mountains of the Island of Salsette, near to Bombay. The Portuguese formerly fitted up one of them as a church, and consequently thought it their duty to deface all the most Pagan looking sculptures.\n\nAt present the fine teak ribs for supporting the roof are almost gone, and the portico is not so elegant as that at Carli. On the sides are two gigantic figures, each 25 feet high, standing erect with their hands close to their bodies, and their heels close together, which resemble the figures of Buddha seen in Ceylon. On each side of the great cave are smaller ones apparently unfinished.\n\nAscending the hill the caves become so numerous, that they resemble an excavated city. Some of them are small, and seem adapted for private dwellings, having a reservoir of water, but others are of a larger size. One of them has a long veranda in front, the chamber within which is 40 feet square, having the sides covered with figures of Jain saints. Narrow doorways in three sides of the cave lead to cells of 10 feet by six, in each of which there is a raised seat; the fourth side has one door, and several windows looking into the veranda. The small caves are in a variety of shapes, and the pillars which support them are not less various.\n\nThe large square cave is situated\nin a ravine, where there are shrubs and trees, and render the spot cooler than any other part of the subterraneous city. The summit of the mountain commands a fine prospect over woods and hills, and arms of the sea; to the continent of India on the one hand, and to the ocean on the other.\n\nKercolang Isle.\u2014See Tolour.\n\nKerinja, (Caranja).\u2014A large walled town, with a fine tank of water, in the province of Berar, the Jaghire of Soubah Khan.\n\nKetee.\u2014This is the principal town belonging to Meer Thara, one of the Amiers of Sinde. It is larger than Corachie, and is situated on an island in the River Indus. The chief villages in its vicinity are Bohur Kadhun, Uselee, and Wahnace.\n\nKeys Isle.\u2014Three islands of considerable extent in the Eastern Seas, situated about the 133d degree of eastern longitude, and between the fifth and sixth degrees of north latitude. They are named Key Watela, Little and Great Key Islands, but respecting them nothing beyond their geographical situation is known.\n\nKeydee, (Cardi).\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, district of Chutta Nagpoor, 235 miles W. by N. from Calcutta. Lat. 22\u00b0. 46'. N. Long. 84\u00b0. 49'. E.\n\nKHANDESH, (Khandesa).\n\nA province in the Decean, situated principally between the 21st and 23d degrees of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by Malwah; on the south by Aurungabad and Berar; on the east it has Berar; and on the west the province of Gujrat. In length it may be estimated at 290 miles, by 90 miles the average breadth.\n\nKhandesh was one of the small soubahs, formed during the reign of Ameer, from conquests made south of the Nerbuddah. It then occupied the space betwixt Malwah on the north; Berar on the east; and Ahmednagar (afterwards Aurungabad) on the west and south; but its boundaries has since fluctuated considerably. In the Ayeen Acberry it is described as follows:\n\n\"The soubah of Dandees. This soubah was originally called Khan- dees, but upon the conquest of the fortress of Aseer, the name was changed to Dandees. It is situated in the second climate. In length from Poorgong, which joins to Hindiah, to Selung, bordering on the territory of Ahmednaggar, it measures 75 coss; and the breadth from Jamood, which confines it towards Berar and Pall, joining to Malwah, is 50 coss. It is bounded on the N.W. by Malwah; Kalneh confines it to the south; on the east lies Berar; and on the north large mountains. The soubah of Khandesh contains 32 mahals; revenue 12,647,072 tungsels.\"\n\nThis is one of the original Maharratta provinces, and is remarkably strong by nature. Within one day's march nearly twenty fortresses, all in sight in different directions may be counted. Chandore, Unky, Tunkey, Saler, Roulce, Nassick, Trimmuck, Galna, Mongy, and Tongy, are all places of this description. The ridge of the Western Ghauts extends along the Tuptee River, from whence there are passes down to Khandesh; which province, although of an irregular surface, and containing many strong holds, is not mountainous. The chief rivers are the Nerbuddah and the Tuptee, and the principal towns Boorhanpoor, Hasser, or Aseer, and Hindia.\n\nA considerable portion of Khandesh is possessed by the Holcar family, being like the province of Malwah divided between the Peshwa, Holcar, and Sindia, but much the largest part is possessed by the two latter powers. Abounding in strong holds, occupied by petty native chiefs, the revenue is collected with great difficulty, and generally requires the intervention of a military force. The province generally is fertile, and to-\nlerably well watered; but, owing to the nature of the government, indifferently cultivated, and but thinly populated. A very great proportion of the inhabitants (probably the five-sixths) are Hindoos of the Brahminical persuasion, and may be estimated not to exceed 2,000,000 in number.\n\nIn the beginning of the 15th century Khandesh was governed by independent sovereigns, claiming their descent from Omar, and residing at Ascer as their capital; but towards the close of the century it was completely subdued, and annexed to the Mogul empire. (Abul Fazel, Tone, the Marquis Wellesley, Rennel, &c.)\n\nKhagunji, (Khaganj).\u2014A town in the province of Agra, district of Farruckabad, 64 miles N. W. from the town of Farruckabad. Lat. 27\u00b0. 52'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 36'. E.\n\nKhemlasa.\u2014A large walled town, with a fort adjoining, situated in the province of Malwah, 94 miles S. W. from Chatterpoor. Lat. 24\u00b0. 15'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 36'. E. This place belongs to the district of Saga, or Sangur, which is distant about 34 miles to the southward. (Hunter, &c.)\n\nKhero.\u2014A town in Tibet, situated to the north of the great Himalaya ridge of mountains. Lat. 28\u00b0. 13'. N. Long. 85\u00b0. 45'. E. This was once a large place, but is now inconsiderable, having been laid waste prior to 1790 by an incursion of the Kala Soogpa Tartars, who occupy the country north of Joon-gale, and who for some time possessed themselves of Lassa. A considerable trade subsists betwixt Nepaul and this place, which nominally belongs to the Dalai Lama of Lassa, but is in fact possessed by the Chinese. From Khero there are no snowy mountains to be seen in the northern quarter; but there are in the south, the west, and the southeast quarters. (Kirkpatrick, &c.)\n\nKhooshalghur, (Khash-halghar).\u2014A mud fort with double walls, round bastions, and a ditch, situated in the province of Ajmeer, 68 miles S. E. from Jeypoor. Lat. 26\u00b0. 27'. E.\n\nKhooshgul.\u2014A well built small hill fort in the province of Bejapoor, district of Bancapoor, strongly situated on the top of a rising ground in the midst of an extensive plain of so regular a descent, that it forms a glacis on every side. Lat. 15\u00b0. 29'. Long. 75\u00b0. 13'. E.\n\nKhozdar.\u2014A town in the province of Baloochistan, the residence of Meer Morad Ali, one of the principal Baloochee Amirs of the Kumburance tribe. Its situation has not been correctly ascertained, but it is somewhere about 36\u00b0. 30'. N. and 67'. E.\n\nThis place stands in a small romantic valley of the same name, between two tremendous ridges of bare rocky mountains, which is tolerably well cultivated, and watered by a stream flowing through the centre. The town is walled, and has a good bazar. Although a Mahommedan town, the Hindoos are held in great esteem, and possess a pagoda dedicated to the goddess Cali. When winter approaches, on account of the severity of the climate, the chief and all the richer class of persons retire southward to Cutch Gundava, to avoid the intense cold, which among these elevated valleys congeals the water. From hence to Kelat, the capital of Baloochistan, is three days journey. (Christie, Kinneir, &c.)\n\nKhyrabad.\u2014A district in the Nabob of Oude's territories, situated principally between the 27th and 28th degrees of north latitude. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, this district is described as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Khyrabad, containing 22 mahals, measurement 1,987,700 bighas; revenue 43,644,381 dams. Seyurghal 1,713,342 dams. This sircar furnishes 1160 cavalry, and 27,800 infantry.\"\n\nThis is a fertile, well watered district, but the cultivation inferior to that of the adjacent districts in the Doab. The principal crops are barley, wheat, tobacco, and small peas.\nThe soil is of a sandy nature, and during the dry season clouds of dust are raised by the wind, yet in the cold season the crops are frequently injured by the frost. There are some fields of sugar cane, but this species of cultivation is as yet imperfect.\n\nThe principal rivers are the Ganges, the Goggrah, and the Goomty; and the chief towns Khyrabad, Shahabad, and Narangabad. (Tenant, Abul Fuzel, &c.)\n\nKHYRABAD.\u2014A town in the province of Oude, 40 miles travelling distance north from Lucknow, the capital of a district of the same name. Lat. 27\u00b0. 29'. N. Long. 80\u00b0. 45'. E.\n\nKHYRPOOR.\u2014A town in the province of Sind, the residence of Meer Sohrab, one of the amirs or princes of that extensive country. It stands six days journey by land from Hyderabad, the capital of Sind, and four by water. It is a place of some trade, and noted for the dyeing of cloths.\n\nKILKARY.\u2014A town on the seacoast of the Southern Carnatic, district of Marawas, 127 miles N. E. from Cape Comorin. Lat. 9\u00b0. 15'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 53'. E.\n\nKIMPEDY, (Cunadi).\u2014A town in the Northern Circars, 83 miles S. W. from Gaujam. Lat. 18\u00b0. 48'. N. Long. 84\u00b0. 11'. E.\n\nKINATOOR.\u2014A small town in the Carnatic, near to which is the highest pagoda, or Hindoo temple, in the province, being 222 feet in height. Lat. 12\u00b0. 15'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 19'. E.\n\nKIRTHIPOOR, (Kirtipura, the famous City).\u2014A town in the valley of Nepaul, about three miles west from Pattn. Lat. 27\u00b0. 30'. N. Long. 85\u00b0. 37'. E.\n\nThis place was once the seat of an independent prince, though at the period of Purthi Narrain's (the Ghoorkhali Rajah's) invasion, it was included in the territory of Pattn. It is said at one period to have reckoned 6000 houses or families within its jurisdiction, but it is at present a place of no great extent or consideration.\n\nWhen Purthi Narrain, the Ghoor-khali Rajah, took this place in 1768, he was so enraged at the long and obstinate defence made by the inhabitants, that he ordered the noses and lips of all the survivors, without exception of age or sex, to be cut off; and the name of the city to be changed to Naskatapoor, which signifies the town of cut noses. This edict appears to have been strictly enforced, as 23 years afterwards the British ambassador at Nepaul found many persons who had outlived this mutilation. (Kirkpatrick, Father Giuseppe, &c. &c.)\n\nKIRWAL.\u2014A town belonging to the Maharattas, in the province of Malwah, 42 miles N. W. from Bil-sah. Lat. 24\u00b0. 2'. N. Long. 76\u00b0.13'. E.\n\nKISHENAGUR DISTRICT, (Krishna Nagar).\u2014See NUDDER.\n\nKISHENAGUR.\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, situated on the S. E. side of the Jellinghy River, 62 miles N. by E. from Calcutta. Lat. 23\u00b0. 26'. N. Long. 88\u00b0. 35'. E.\n\nKISHENAGUR.\u2014A town in the province of Ajmeer, 13 miles S. E. from the city of Ajmeer. Lat. 26\u00b0. 32'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 1'. E.\n\nThis is the capital of a small but independent principality, in the neighbourhood of Ajmeer, the revenues of which amount to four lacks of rupees per annum. The rajah's relations and the descendants of his family amount in number to near 5000, and are all fed and married at the rajah's expense, whose government is completely patriarchal. In return they act as soldiers, and defend the state. The rajah is of the Rhatore tribe of Rajpoots, but the majority of the cultivators are Jauts. (Broughton, G. Thomas, &c.)\n\nKISHENGUNGA RIVER, (Krishna Ganga, Black River).\u2014This river has its source in the mountains to the north of the Packoli district, and after a short course joins the Jhylam River on the north-western frontier of the province of Lahore.\nKishtewar, (Cushthavar, abounding in Wood).\u2014A district in the north-eastern extremity of the province of Lahore, situated principally between the 33rd and 34th degrees of north latitude, and bounded on the north-west by the southern range of Cashmere Hills.\n\nThis district is in general very hilly and woody, and but thinly inhabited, the climate in winter being extremely cold. It is intersected by the River Chimaub, which in some places is 70 yards broad, and extremely rapid. At the village of Nausman it is crossed in a basket slung to a rope, reaching from side to side, which is pulled along the rope with its goods or passengers, and then back again. In 1783 this was one of the few independent Hindoo districts remaining in India, yet the chief was a Mahomedan. It probably still remains independent, having few attractions for invaders. (Foster, &c.)\n\nKishtewar.\u2014A town in the province of Lahore, named also Triloknath, situated close to the southern range of Cashmere Hills, and 94 miles E.S.E. from the city of Cashmere. Lat. 34\u00b0 7'. N. Long. 75\u00b0 20'. E.\n\nKisser.\u2014A small island, about 20 miles in circumference, lying off the north-eastern extremity of Timor. Lat. 8\u00b0 5'. S. Long. 127\u00b0 5'. E. It is inhabited, and affords refreshments and water for shipping.\n\nKistna River, (Krishna, the Sable).\u2014This river has its source in the Western Ghauts, not far from Satarah, in the province of Bejapoor, and only 50 miles from the west coast of India. From hence it proceeds in a S.W. direction, until it reaches Merjitch, when its bulk is greatly increased by the junction of the River Warnah, formed by a variety of streamlets that fall from the Ghauts. After this bending more to the eastward it receives the accession of the Malpuba, Gutpurba, Beenah, and Toombuddra, and with an augmented volume proceeds to the Bay of Bengal, where it forms the northern boundary of the Guntoor Circar. During its course, which, including the windings, may be estimated at 650 miles, it waters and fertilizes the provinces of Bejapoor, Beeder, Hyderabad, and the districts of Paulnaud, Guntoor, and Condapilly. The term Krishna signifies black or dark blue, and is the name of the favourite deity of the Hindoos\u2014an incarnation of the preserving power, Vishnu.\n\nThis river forms the proper boundary of the Deccan, as understood by the best Mahomedan authors, and the south of India\u2014a name in modern times restricted to the regions south of the Krishna, miscalled the Peninsula. The earliest Mahomedan army that crossed this river was led in 1310 by Kafoor against Dhoor Summooder, the capital of Bellal Deo, sovereign of Karnata, a Hindoo empire then existing, which comprehended all the elevated table land above the eastern and western chain of mountains. (Wilks, Moor, J. Grant, &c.)\n\nKistnapatnam, (Krishnapatan).\u2014A town on the sea-coast of the Carnatic, 87 miles N. from Madras. Lat. 14\u00b0 19'. N. Long. 80\u00b0 16'. E.\n\nKistnagherry, (Krishna-ghiri).\u2014A town and fortress in the province of Barramahal, 105 miles west from Seringapatam. Lat. 12\u00b0 32'. N. Long. 78\u00b0 23'. E.\n\nNear to this place the country consists of a plain, in which are scattered high rocky, insulated mountains, of a very singular and grand appearance. That on which the fort is situated is 700 feet in perpendicular height, and so remarkably bare and steep, that it was never taken except by surprise. In Nov. 1791, the British troops were repulsed with considerable loss in an attempt to storm this fortress; along with the district it was subsequently ceded to the British, who destroyed the fortifications, which from the altered situation of affairs in the Mysore became unnecessary.\n\nMuch of the plain in this neighbourhood is rice ground; but the\nsoil, although well watered, is poor. The road from Ryacottab to Kistnagerry leads mostly through narrow defiles among hills covered with brushwood, which is also the case from hence to Malapaddy. This last town, although placed in the centre of the Barramahal, never belonged to that province, having been long annexed to Arcot. (F. Buchanan, Dirom, Salt, &c.)\n\nKisty.\u2014An Afghan town, situated to the west of the Indus, in the province of Hajykan, 120 miles S.W. from Mooltan. Lat. 29\u00b0. 18'. N. Long. 70\u00b0. 3'. E.\n\nKittoor.\u2014A town and small district in the Peshwa's territories, in the province of Bejapoor, 20 miles S. E. from Merritch.\n\nThis place was originally tributary to the Poonah state, and the dessaye had a few villages in the jaghire; but, after the death of the Peshwa, Madhurow, the dessaye, took advantage of the convulsions that ensued, and usurped the whole. In 1804 the renter of the district complained to General Wellesley that, though a subject of the Peshwa's, his country was plundered and devastated, not only by two neighbouring feudatories of his highnesses (Gokliah and Appah Dessaye), but also by the Peshwa's own deputy, the sirsoubah. By the interposition of the British government peace was restored, and the dessaye compelled to fulfil his engagements with the Peshwa; but at the same time protected in his own just rights. This district is fertile, and during a period of peace may be expected to yield from five to six lacks of rupees per annum. (MSS. &c.)\n\nKobragur River.\u2014A small river in the province of Gundwana, which flows past the town of Byrahgur, and afterwards falls into the Baum Gunga, or Wainy River.\n\nKohraan, or Orshere, (Kogheran, Great Mountains).\u2014A district in the north-western quarter of the province of Lahore, situated between the 33d and 34th degrees of north latitude, and bounded on the east by the Jhyum or Hydaspes River. The face of the country is extremely hilly and wild, and the country but thinly inhabited, being mostly possessed by petty native chiefs, alternately tributary to the Seiks and Afghans. It contains no town of note.\n\nKohaut.\u2014An Afghan town in the province of Cabul, 53 miles west from Attock, on the Indus. Lat. 35\u00b0. 6'. N. Long. 70\u00b0. 20'. E.\n\nKonapoor, (Conapur).\u2014A town in the province of Bejapoor, 38 miles W.N.W. from Darwar. Lat. 15\u00b0. 34'. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 32'. E.\n\nKonjeur.\u2014A small district in the province of Orissa, situated principally between the 21st and 22d degrees of north latitude. To the north it has the districts of Singboom and Mohurbunge, and to the south the Company's province of Cuttack. It continues occupied by independent native chiefs, but was formerly tributary to the Nagpoor Maharattas. It is fertilized by many streams, and is capable of a high state of cultivation, but continues very desolate. The principal towns are Konjeur, Ogurapoort, and Andapoorgur.\n\nKonjeur, or Kondojurry.\u2014A town in the province of Orissa, district of Konjeur, of which it is the capital. Lat. 21\u00b0. 34'. N. Long. 83\u00b0. 45'. E.\n\nKonibar Isle.\u2014A very small island in the Eastern Seas, situated to the north of Wageeoo. The inhabitants cultivate plantations of yams, potatoes, sugar-canee, and other tropical productions. With Wageeoo they barter turtle sausages, made of turtle eggs, for sago either baked or raw. They also carry tortoise-shell and swallo to sell to the Chinese, who trade to that island in sloops. (Forest, &c.)\n\nKoohangan Isle.\u2014A very small island in the Eastern Seas, one of the Sooloo Archipelago. It is uninhabited, and appears like two islands, there being a narrow isthmus in the middle.\n\nKookies, (Cucis, or Lunctas).\u2014\nThe Kookies are a race of people who live among the mountains to the north east of the Chittagong district, in the province of Bengal. They reside at a greater distance than the Choomeas from the inhabitants of the plain, to whom they are consequently but little known; and are seldom seen, except when they visit the markets on the borders of the jungles, in the Runganeah and Amungabad divisions, to purchase salt, dried fish, and tobacco.\n\nThe Kookies are a stout, muscular people, but not tall, and have the peculiar features of all the natives of the eastern parts of Asia, namely, the flat nose, small eye, and broad round face. They are all hunters and warriors, and divided into a number of distinct tribes, independent of each other. They are armed with bows and arrows, clubs, spears, and daws. They choose the steepest and most inaccessible hills to build their villages on, which generally contain from 500 to 2000 inhabitants.\n\nLike other savages the Kookies are engaged in perpetual warfare, and prefer ambuscades and surprises to regular open fighting. When upon a secret expedition they fasten their hammocks among the branches of the loftiest trees, so as not to be perceived from underneath. Among these tribes salt is in high estimation, and a little is always sent with a message, to confirm its importance. Next to personal valour, the accomplishment most valued in a warrior is a superior dexterity in stealing.\n\nThis miserable race are of a most vindictive disposition, and blood must always be shed for blood on the principle of retaliation. As they have no prejudice of caste, no animal killed in the chase is rejected; an elephant being considered an immense prize, from the quantity of food he affords. They migrate every four or five years from one situation to another, but seldom to a greater distance than 12 hours journey. Their domestic animals are gayals, goats, hogs, dogs, and fowls; but the first is the most valued; yet they make no use whatever of the milk, but rear the gayals entirely for their flesh and skins.\n\nThe Kookies have an idea of a future state, where they are rewarded or punished according to their merits in this world. They conceive that nothing is more pleasing to the deity, or more certainly ensures their future happiness, than destroying a great number of their enemies. They are a great terror to the inhabitants on the borders of the Chittagong district, and are a particular annoyance to the wood-cutters. (Mauree, &c.)\n\nKoolassian Isle.\u2014A small island in the Eastern Seas, one of the Sooloo Archipelago. It is a low island, covered with wood, but destitute of water or inhabitants.\n\nKoondah.\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, district of Ramgur, 105 miles S. by W. from Patna. Lat. 24\u00b0. 11'. N. Long. 84\u00b0. 47'. E.\n\nKoontassee.\u2014A small town in the Gujrat Peninsula, situated in the district of Moorvee, near the Run.\n\nFrom the village of Bhey to this place the country is in a deplorable state, and the villages nearly uninhabited, on account of the tumult and confusion that pervade the whole district. The adjacent country is a perfect flat, with little or no wood; but cultivation is only seen in the immediate vicinity of villages.\n\nKoorbah, (Curava).\u2014A town in the province of Gundwana, district of Choteesgur, 36 miles N. E. from Rutunpoor. Lat. 22\u00b0. 25'. N. Long. 83\u00b0. 8'. E.\n\nKoorwey.\u2014A town in the province of Malwah, situated on the banks of the Betwah, 113 miles S. W. from Chatterpoor. Lat. 24\u00b0. 11'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 17'. E. Koorwey and Boraso are two towns almost united, and are of considerable size, the first having a large stone fort. They are inhabited by Patans, who settled here during the reign of Aurengzebe. In 1790 the nabob's revenue amount-\ned to between one and two lacks of rupees, but it was sequestered by the Maharattas for payment of a debt due to them. (Hunter, &c.)\n\nKORAVLI, (Capala, the Front).\u2014A town belonging to the Nizam, in the province of Bejapoor, district of Gujundurgur, 63 miles N. W. from Bellary. Lat.15\u00b0.28'. N. Long.76\u00b0.6'. E.\n\nThis is one of the strongest places in the South of India. The lower fort is a semi-circle, at the bottom of a steep rocky mountain, immediately commanded by a middle and upper fort. The last overlooks the whole, and contains granaries and reservoirs, excavated in the solid rock. The whole is formed of one immense rock, almost perpendicular to a great height, except one part to the south east, where a wall is erected 66 feet high and 36 feet thick, mostly composed of large stones. The breadth between the rocks is about 30 feet.\n\nIn 1790, when this place was possessed by Tippoo, it was besieged by the Nizam's army, assisted by a small detachment. It held out six months, and at length capitulated, the governor being more intimidated to this measure, by the fall of Bangalore, than compelled by any urgent necessity. The garrison, in number about 2000, were allowed to march south, and the adjacent country was overrun and destroyed by the Nizam's cavalry. (MS. &c.)\n\nKORAH, (Cura).\u2014A district in the province of Allahabad, situated in the doab of the Ganges and Jumna, and between the 26th and 27th degrees of north latitude. The country in general is flat, excepting on the high banks of the Ganges, on which the villages are usually situated, surrounded by mango trees, and which in many places expands to reaches of eight or nine miles extent. The whole territory is fertile, well watered, and in a progressive state of prosperity, since it was ceded to the British, by the Nabob of Oude, in 1801. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Korah, containing nine mahals; measurement, 341,170 bighas; revenue, 17,397,567 dams; seyngghal, 469,350 dams. This sircar furnishes 500 cavalry, 10 elephants, and 15,000 infantry.\"\n\nKORAH.\u2014A town in the province of Allahabad, situated in the doab of the Ganges and Jumna. Lat. 26\u00b0. 6'. N. Long. 80\u00b0. 40'. E.\n\nTravelling distance from Lucknow, 67 miles; from Agra, 184; from Delhi, 301; and from Calcutta, by Birbhum, 655 miles. (Rennel, &c. &c.)\n\nKORCH.\u2014A village in the province of Cutch, situated about 10 miles south from Lucknud Bunder, on the road from that place to Maudavee, a sea-port on the Gulf of Cutch. Lat. 23\u00b0. 35'. N.\n\nThe surrounding country is very hilly, and yields large quantities of iron ore. Near the village are two or three furnaces for smelting it. (Maxfield, &c.)\n\nKORINCHI.\u2014A district or valley in the Island of Sumatra, situated at the back of the range of high mountains by which the countries of Anak Sangei and Indrapoor are bounded. This valley is at a great height above the sea, and contains one of the beautiful lakes so common among the mountains in the interior of Sumatra. It abounds with fish, and its banks are covered with villages.\n\nThe inhabitants of this district are below the common stature of the Malays, with harsher visages, high cheek bones, and well knit in their limbs. They are exceedingly jealous of strangers. These people dwell in hordes, many families being crowded together in one long building, sometimes extending 250 feet. The potatoe is here a common article of food, but the cocoa nut proves abortive. The soil produces excellent tobacco and cotton, and also indigo of the small leafed kind. The natives make gunpowder, and in order to increase its strength (as they imagine), they mix it with pepper dust.\nIn a small recess on the margin of the lake, accessible only by water, is one of those receptacles of misery to which the leprous are sent. The inhabitants of this elevated mountainous region are described as having stronger animal spirits than those of the plain, and pass their lives with more variety than the torpid inhabitants of the coast. They breathe a greater spirit of independence, and being frequently engaged in warfare, village against village, are better prepared to resist invasion. (Marsden, from Mr. Charles Campbell.)\n\nKorjehaak.\u2014A small Seik town in the province of Lahore, situated on the west side of the Jhyium (the ancient Hyassus), 74 miles N. W. from the city of Lahore. Lat. 32\u00b0. 40'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 4'. E.\n\nKoround.\u2014A town in the Nabob of Oude's territories, 27 miles N. by W. from the city of Lucknow. Lat. 27\u00b0. 11'. N. Long. 80\u00b0. 44'. E.\n\nKoshab, (Khush ab, sweet Water).\u2014A small town in the Afghan territories, in the province of Lahore, 90 miles N. N. E. from the city of Lahore. Lat. 31\u00b0. 44'. N. Long. 71\u00b0. 59'. E.\n\nKotah, (Catu, the Fort).\u2014A town in the province of Ajmeer, district of Harowty, situated on the east side of the Chumbul, 150 miles travelling distance N. from Oojain. Lat. 25\u00b0. 11'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 48'. E.\n\nThis city is of considerable extent, and of an irregular oblong form, enclosed by a stone wall with round bastions, within which are many good stone houses, besides several handsome public buildings. To the west it has the River Chumbul, and on the north-east a clear lake; which on two sides is banked with stone, and in the centre has a building called Jugmundul, consecrated to religious purposes.\n\nIn 1790, the revenue of Kotah and the adjoining district was 30 lacks of rupees; out of which a tribute was paid of two lacks of rupees to Sindia, and the same to Holkar. At present the River Parbuttee forms one boundary of the Kotah territories, the legitimate rajah of which (of the tribe Hara,) is kept in confinement by a person named Rajah Zalim Singh, who has long usurped the management of public affairs, and still occupied the government in 1805. (Hunter, Broughton, Rennel, &c.)\n\nKoyar.\u2014A town in the Nizam's territories, in the province of Berar, 20 miles N. W. from Chandah. Lat. 20\u00b0. 6'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 35'. E.\n\nKrakatoa Isle.\u2014This island is the southernmost of a group situated in the Straits of Sunda. It has a high peaked hill at the south end, which lies in 6\u00b0. 9'. S. and 105\u00b0. 15'. E. The whole circuit of the island is not more than 10 miles. Krakatoa is esteemed very healthy in comparison with the neighbouring countries, and contains a hot spring, which the natives use as a bath. The whole island is covered with trees, except on the spots which the natives have cleared for rice fields. The coral reefs afford plenty of small turtle. (King, &c.)\n\nKraw.\u2014This isthmus connects the Malay Peninsula with the continent of Asia; and in the narrowest part does not exceed 97 miles across from sea to sea. On the west side there is a river navigable for vessels a little way up, where the portage or carrying place is but six hours from another river called Tomfong; which, without falls or rapids, runs through a well inhabited country, formerly subject to Siam, into the Bay of Siam, near the Larchin Islands. This quarter has, however, been recently much devastated by the wars of the Birmans and Siamese. This isthmus is within three weeks sail of Madras, and if it were desirable, an overland intercourse for the conveyance of letters to and from China might be established, to save the time and trouble of going round the Peninsula by the Straits of Malacca. (Forrest, &c.)\n\nKrishna River.\u2014See Kistna.\nKUNTEE.\n\nKuntar.\u2014A small and mountainous district, in the province of Cashmere, situated between the 34th and 35th degrees of north latitude.\n\nKumballia.\u2014A town in the Gujrat Peninsula, situated near the Gulf of Cutch, and subject to the Jam of Noanagur.\n\nThis place is populous, and contains many houses inhabited by Gogla Brahmins, who are attendants on Runchor (an incarnation of Vishnu) at Dwaraca. These Brahmins, having realized fortunes from the pilgrims who resort to the pagoda, have retired to Kumballia, as an asylum adapted for commerce, to which they are much inclined.\n\nThe port of this place is the village of Sirreyah, distant about five miles, and situated on the sea shore; the inhabitants being mostly fishermen and sea-faring people. It is frequented by vessels of from 150 to 200 cadies (560 pounds each), but the merchants residing at Kumballia, the port generally has that name also. The imports are rice, cocoa nuts, and spices, from Malabar, and timber from Calicut and Damann. From hence bajerec is sent across the Gulf to Cutch, the inhabitants of which consume much of that grain, but raise little in their own country.\n\nKumballia is a walled town with four gates, the fortifications being merely sufficient to keep the surrounding country in awe; but the town is substantially built, the rocky hills in the neighbourhood affording abundance of materials. The town is said to have received its name from a remarkably lofty stone pillar, now removed, which pillars are called by the natives Kumbha. The banks of the River Ghce, for some distance up and down from Kumballia, are covered with gardens, producing the fruits common to this side of Hindostan, and vegetables are also plenty. A dam is built across the River Ghce, and raised 12 feet above its bed, which contains water sufficient for the town throughout the whole year. The surrounding country is fertile, and intersected by the River Oond. (Macnudo, &c.)\n\nKundal, (Caudula).\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Tipera, 74 miles S. W. by S. from Dacca. Lat. 23\u00b0 12'. N. Long. 91\u00b0 18'. E. The adjacent country is almost one entire forest, abounding with all sorts of wild animals, particularly elephants of an excellent quality, but inferior in value to those of Chittagong.\n\nKundapur.\u2014A town in the province of Canara, 55 miles N. N. W. from Mangalore. Lat. 13\u00b0 33'. N. Long. 74\u00b0 47'. E.\n\nThis place is situated on the banks of a river, which, in different places, is called by different names, according to the villages which it passes. This river is, in general, the boundary between the northern and southern divisions of Canara; but Kundapur was formerly under the collector of the northern division.\n\nAt the villages on the banks of this river all the goods going to, or coming from Bednore, are landed and shipped. The custom house is at Kundapoor, but the principal shipping-place is further up the river at Barcelore. On the north side of the river Tippoo had a dock; but the water on the bar, even at spring tides, does not exceed 13\u00bd feet. The river, or rather lake, at Kundapur, has only one opening into the sea, but receives five fresh water streams from the hills, which, meeting the tide in this wide basin, form a number of islands. The town at present contains above 300 houses, and was formerly the head-quarters of a battalion of sepoys. (F. Buchanan, &c., &c.)\n\nKunnee, (Cau).\u2014A town in the province of Delhi, district of Sirhind. This place is surrounded with a mud wall, 20 feet high, with a wet ditch all round, 12 feet deep, and 18 broad; yet, in 1809, it was evacuated to the British without resistance. (11th Register, &c.)\nKurda.\u2014A town in the province of Gujrat, near the N.W. frontier, and situated about three miles south from Theraud, to which it is subject. Approaching from the south the jungle continues as far as Kurda, where it opens gradually, but the soil continues sandy and unproductive, with thickets scattered over it. The want of water is everywhere felt, which may probably account for the paucity of wild animals to be found in the country.\n\nKurgommah, (Curgama).\u2014A town in the province of Gundwana, 64 miles N. from Rutunpoor. Lat. 28\u00b0. 11'. N. Long. 89\u00b0. 25'. E. This place is situated in the proper Goand country, and continues subject to an independent rajah of that tribe. In the wild country, a few miles south from Kurgommah, neither silver nor copper coins are current, but cowries pass for twice the value they sustain in Bengal.

The length of the island may be estimated at 13 miles, by four the average breadth. On the surrounding sea coast small oysters of an excellent flavour are procured, and transported by the inhabitants to Dacca and Calcutta for sale to the Europeans, the natives having an aversion to every species of shell fish.\n\nKyndee.\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, district of Ramgur, 95 miles S. by W. from Patna.

To the north it is bounded by the great Himalaya ridge of mountains; to the south by the Morning hills and forests; on the east it has Bootan; and on the west it is separated from Nepaul Proper, by an unexplored tract little known to Europeans. The River Teesta or Sanpoo is the principal river, and Damsong the chief town.\n\nThis territory was formerly independent, but in the year 1769 the Rajah of Goreah having, after four years' warfare, completed the conquest of Nepaul, made himself master also of this country, and of other districts, as far as the borders of Cooch, Bahar, and Bootan.\n\nKyreeghur.\u2014A town in the province of Oude, district of Barely, situated on the east side of the Goggrah River, 102 miles north from Lucknow.

(Forest.)\n\nLacaracoonda, (Lakerikhanda).\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Birhoom, 116 miles N.E. from Calcutta. Lat. 23\u00b0. 48'. N. Long. 87\u00b0. 15'. E.\n\nLaccadive Isles, (Laksha dwipa,\nA Lack of Islets.\u2014An Archipelago of low shoaly islands lying off the coast of Malabar, which is about 75 miles distant from the nearest, and extending from the 10th to 12th degree of north latitude, being separated from each other by very wide channels. These islands are very small, the largest not containing six square miles of land, and are surrounded by coral shoals, which renders their approach dangerous.\n\nMost of these islands are subject to the Bibby, or Princess of Cannanore; and produce no grain, nor indeed any thing but cocoa nuts, betel nuts, and plantains. The inhabitants are all Mopays (Mahommedans), are very poor, and subsist mostly on cocoa nuts and fish. Their principal exports are coir, which they make from the husk of the cocoa nut, jaggery, cocoa nuts, and a little betel nut. Some coral is also carried from the surrounding reefs to the continent of India, where it is used for making images, and for burning into quick lime. The best coir cables on the Coast of Malabar are made at Anjengo and Cochin from the fibres of the Laccadive cocoa nut; with the stem the natives of the islands make their boats, and their houses are entirely constructed from the materials furnished by that valuable palm. These islands were discovered by Vasco de Gama during his first voyage, when returning to Europe in 1499; but they have never been perfectly explored, and their poverty has hitherto preserved them from foreign invaders. (F. Buchanan, &c. &c.)\n\nLacky Jungle.\u2014See Batinda.\n\nLactho.\u2014A province in India, beyond the Ganges, tributary to the sovereign of Cochin China, but which does not appear to have been ever explored by any European. To the south it is bounded by Laos; to the north and east by Tungquin; and to the west by China.\n\nThis territory is described by the Tungquinese as mountainous, rocky, covered with jungle, and destitute of navigable rivers; the air singularly pestilential to the constitutions of strangers, and the water extremely unwholesome, although the climate is cooler than Tungquin. In going from Tunkin to Laetho travellers are obliged to traverse for three or four days a wild uninhabited tract, and in the interior of Lactho the country is not much better, the population being dispersed over it in small and savage communities, whose dialects are unintelligible to each other. They are governed by hereditary chiefs, and engaged perpetually in hostilities with the neighbouring tribes\u2014quarter being seldom granted on either side.\n\nThe small commerce that subsists is carried on with Tungquin, from whence salt is imported; but in cases of necessity they procure a salt of a very inferior quality from the ashes of burned vegetables. Salt fish, oil, and some silk stuffs for the chiefs, are also imported; the exports to Tungquin are chiefly buffaloes and cotton. There is no coin current here except what is procured from Tungquin, the traffic being carried on by barter, in which buffaloes are medium of exchange. In some parts of Lactho shells, or cowries, are used for exchanging articles of small value.\n\nThe Tungquinese, from whom all our information is derived, assert, that in this province there are many extraordinary natural caverns, which appear to have been formerly inhabited, and to have served as temples to the natives. Many of them are now filled with petrifactions and chrysalizations of different sorts and colours. One cavern is described as a mile across, perforating a mountain, and another as being entered under ground in a boat.\n\nLactho never having been visited by any European, the nature of its religion has never been accurately ascertained; but it is, in all probability, some modification of the widely extended doctrines of Buddlia. Some of the tribes, whose habitations are\npermanent, have idols, which are reputed to be the same as those of Tungquin; but it is said the veneration for their ancestors, so common over this part of Asia, does not prevail. (De Bissacher, &c.)\n\n**Lados Isles.**\u2014A cluster of high rugged small islands, running in ridges from the mountains to the sea, with beautiful valleys between them, and situated off the N. W. coast of the Malay Peninsula. Lat. 6\u00b0. 5'. N. Long. 99\u00b0. 40'. E.\n\n**Ladrones' Isles.**\u2014A cluster of small islands situated off the southern extremity of China, the latitude of the great Ladrone being 21\u00b0. 52'. N. and the longitude 113\u00b0. 44'. E. With the adjacent islands the Ladrones are so near to the continent, that they appear like disjointed fragments from the main land. All the islands to the eastward of the great Ladrone are steeper than those to the westward. The former are high and uneven, and the depth of water among them is about 20 fathoms. The latter are of an even surface, and when taken together appear like a continued land, the water among them being shoaler than among the former. There are some springs to be found on them, the water of which is not brackish, nor has it a chalybeate, or any other mineral taste.\n\nThe Ladrone Islands are the resort of pirates who infest the mouth of the Canton River, and have long set the whole naval power of the Chinese at defiance. In 1805 they had by conquest acquired possession of the southern part of Formosa, from whence a great deal of grain is exported, and of the whole Island of Hainan. (Staunton, Krusenstern, &c.)\n\n**Lahar.**\u2014A small town subject to the Maharattas, in the province of Agra, 40 miles S. E. from Gohud. Lat. 26\u00b0. 13'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 59'. E.\n\n**Lahdack, (Ladah).**\u2014A province to the north of the great Himalaya ridge of mountains, and situated principally between the 34th and 37th degrees of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by Tibet; on the south by the Nahry Sangkar province; to the east it has Tibet; and on the west the province of Cashmere. Its limits are wholly undefined, and the interior has been but imperfectly explored. The province is remarkably elevated and rugged, but most probably declines from its southern and most elevated boundary both to the north and west.\n\nBy the merchants in Hindostan, who trade to the regions of Tibet, Lahdack is described as an independent territory situated from Gertokh in Tibet west; from Cashmere north; at a distance of 13 days journey from either place. The town of Lahdack is the mart between Cashmere and Teesoo Loomboo. From Tibet it imports the fine goats hair, or shawl wool, which is re-exported to Cashmere, and there manufactured into shawls; to Tibet Lahdack exports apricots, raisins, kishmisses, currants, dates, almonds, and saffron. The trade is entirely managed by the inhabitants of Tibet, who find a direct road beyond the Himalaya Mountains, and over a level country from Gertokh to Lahdack.\n\nWe are so little acquainted with the interior of this province, that it has never been accurately ascertained what religion the natives profess; but from their geographical position, and other circumstances, it is probable they follow the doctrines of Buddha. The father of the Teeshoo Lama, who reigned in 1774, was a Tibetan, and his mother a near relation of the Rajah of Lahdack, from whom he learned the Hindostany language, which he could speak when visited by Mr. Bogle, the ambassador dispatched by Mr. Hastings to his court. (Colebrooke, Webb, Turner, Bogle, &c.)\n\n**Lahdack.**\u2014A town in the province of Lahdack, placed in the maps in Lat. 35\u00b0. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 10'. E. but as the geography of the province is as yet very uncertain, it is probable that when better explored a new position will be assigned to\nthis place. Merchants travelling from Hindostan to Yarehand in Chinese Tartary rendezvous at this place, from whence they proceed in a body, travelling the greatest part of the way along the banks of the Indus, which they assert comes within two days journey of Lahdack. If true, this fact would materially alter the geography of this part of Asia, but the natives are generally so loose and inaccurate in their observations, that it cannot be depended on. (Wilford, &c. &c.)\n\nLAHORE.\n\nA large province in Hindostan, extending from the 30th to 34th degrees of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by the province of Cashmere, and the districts of Puckoli and Muzaffarabad; to the south by Delhi, Ajmeer, and Mooltan; to the east it is separated by the Sutuleje from various districts in Northern Hindostan; and to the west by the Indus from Afghanistan. In length it may be estimated at 320 miles, by 220 miles the average breadth. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, this province is described as follows:\n\n\"The soubah of Lahore is situated in the second climate. The length from the River Sutuleje is 180 coss, the breadth from Bhember to Chowkundy, one of the dependencies of Sutgurrah, measures 86 coss. On the east lies Sirhind; on the north Cashmere; on the south Beykaneer and Ajmeer; Mooltan bounds it on the west. This soubah has six fine rivers issuing from the northern mountains; the Sutuleje, the Beyah, the Ravey, the Chinaub, the Jhyulum, or Behut, anciently the Bedusta, and the Sinde, or Indus.\n\n\"This soubah is very populous, highly cultivated, and exceeding healthy. The cultivated lands are chiefly supplied with water from wells. The winter is much severer here than in any other part of Hindostan, although considerably milder than in Persia or Tartary. Ice brought from the northern mountains is sold the whole year. The horses resemble irakies, and are very fine. In some parts by sifting and washing the sands of the rivers, they obtain gold, silver, copper, rowey, tin, brass, and lead.\n\n\"This soubah contains five doabehs, subdivided into 234 pergannahs. The measured lands are 16,155,643 becgahs; amount of revenue 569,458,423 dams; out of which 9,865,594 dams are seyurghal. It has 54,480 cavalry, and 426,086 infantry. This province is subdivided into the following districts, viz. 1. Doabeh Beyt Jallinder; 2. Doabeh Barry; 3. Retchnabad; 4. Doabeh Jennet; and 5. Sinde Sagor.\"\n\nThe district named Retchnabad, in the above description, comprehends the country between the Ravey and the Chinaub; and the Doabeh Jennet, that between the Chenaub and the Jhyulum.\n\nThe province of Lahore consists of two portions nearly equal; the mountainous, which occupies the whole extent from 32\u00b0 north, and the flat country to the south of this latitude, better known by the name of the Punjab, from the five celebrated rivers by which it is intersected, which latter appellation is sometimes but erroneously applied to the whole province. The climate of course varies, and in the winter season a degree of cold, little inferior to that of the central regions of Europe, is experienced in the northern districts.\n\nThat part of the province denominated the Punjab is by far the most fertile, and produces in great abundance, when properly cultivated, wheat, barley, rice, pulse of all sorts, sugar cane, tobacco, and various fruits, and is also well supplied with cattle. Owing, however, to the devastations it has sustained, and the number of petty hostile states into which it is subdivided, the whole tract of country being betwixt the Jamna and the Indus, is but very\nimperfectly cultivated, and exhibits a great proportion of waste land.\n\nIn the eastern parts of this province the sides of the inhabited mountains produce wheat, barley, and a variety of small grains. The cultivated spaces project from the body of the hill, in separate flats, in the form of a range of semicircular stairs. The ground, which is strong and productive, has been propelled into these projections by the rains, which fall with great violence among these mountains from June until October. The earth washed down is preserved in that state by buttresses of loose stones. Rice is also cultivated in the narrow valleys, but not in great quantities; nor is it the usual food of the inhabitants, who chiefly subsist on wheat, and bread and pease made into a thick soup.\n\nIn the mountainous tract between Jambore and Cashmere are seen many pines, which grow on the face of the mountains, and the willow here is also a common occurrence. The resinous part of the fir cut in slips supplies the common uses of the lamp, but the method of extracting its turpentine and tar is not known, or practised by the natives.\n\nThe climate of the northern districts of Lahore is not favourable to fruits and vegetables, being too hot for the Persian productions, and not sufficiently warm to mature those of India. In many parts of this province large beds of fossil salt are found, and the mountainous tracts were they investigated would probably prove rich in all sorts of minerals.\n\nAn open regular trade with the Punjab, from the other parts of Hindostan has, in a great measure, ceased; but petty merchants, by applying for passports to the different chiefs of the Seik territories, previous to entering their boundaries, are generally supplied with them, through which medium a trifling commerce is carried on. The exports from Lahore to the countries west of the Indus are sugar, rice, indigo, wheat, and white cotton cloths; the imports from these countries are swords, horses, fruit, lead, and spices. The exports to Cashmere are nearly the same as to Persia; the imports being shawls, a variety of cloths, saffron, and fruit.\n\nWith the inhabitants of the mountains the natives of the Punjab exchange cloth, matchlocks, horses, for iron and other smaller commodities. From the Deccan are imported sulphur, indigo, salt, lead, iron, European coarse broad cloth, and spices; the exports to the Deccan are horses, camels, sugar, rice, white cloth, matchlocks, swords, and bows and arrows. This trade is not carried on by any particular route, but depends on the character of the chiefs through whose districts they pass. The most considerable part of the trade is carried on from Amritsir by the way of Matchwaywara to Duttayala southward, by the way of Hansi, Rajghur, and Orcecha, into the western part of the Rajpoot country by the way of Kythul, Jeind, and Dadery, and lastly by Carnaul towards Delhi.\n\nCommerce is much obstructed, heavy duties being levied on it by all the petty rulers through whose districts it passes, which caused great part of the Cashmere trade to be carried to Hindostan Proper, by the difficult and mountainous route of Jamnou, Nadone, and Srinagar. The Seik chiefs in the Punjab, have, however, lately discovered their error; and have endeavoured by a more strict administration of justice, and affording facilities, to restore confidence to the merchant.\n\nIn the collection of the revenue the general rule with the Seiks is, that the chief receives one half of the produce; but the whole of this is never levied, the ryots, or cultivators, being treated with great indulgence. The administration of justice among this sect is in a very rude and imperfect state; for although their scriptures inculcate general maxims of justice, they are not considered as books of law. Tri-\nDisputes are settled by the heads of villages, by the chiefs, or by arbitration. This last is called panchayet, or a court of five, and is a court of arbitration assembled in every part of India under a native government; and as they are always chosen from men of the best reputation in the place where they meet, this court has a high character for justice. Murder is sometimes punished by the chief, but more generally by the relations of the deceased.\n\nThe inhabitants of this province are composed of Seiks, Singhs, Jauts, Rajpoots, other Hindoos of lower castes, and Mahomedans. The inhabitants professing the Mahomedan religion, remaining within the Seik territories in the province of Lahore, are very numerous, but all poor, and appear an oppressed, despised race. They till the ground, and are employed to carry burdens, and do all sorts of hard labour. They are not allowed to eat beef, or to say their prayers aloud, and but seldom permitted to assemble in their mosques, of which few have escaped destruction. The lower orders of Seiks are more fortunate. They are protected from the tyranny and violence of their chiefs by the precepts of their common religion, and by the condition of their country, which enables to abandon, whenever they choose, a leader whom they dislike; and the distance of a few miles generally places them under the protection of his rival and enemy. In the Punjab it is reckoned that one-fourth of the whole inhabitants are Singhs, who continue to receive converts; but a considerable number of the cultivators are Jauts. The natives of the mountains are composed of different classes of Hindoos; and little difference of manner is seen between them and the southern Hindoos, except such as arise from a residence in a low or a mountainous country. The women in the hilly tracts towards the east have an olive complexion, and are delicately shaped; their manners are also under less constraint than to the south in Hindostan Proper. Among these mountaineers the goitres, or swelled throat, is very common.\n\nIn the north-western borders of Lahore the inhabitants are chiefly Afghans, who live in small forts or walled villages, and entertain mutual dread and distrust of each other. This quarter is subjected to much desolation by the depredations of the Seiks on the Attock and adjacent districts. The Seik inhabitants between the Ravey and Chianaub are called Dharpi Singhs, from the country being called Dharpi. The Dhanegeb Singhs are beyond the Chianaub, but within the Jhulum River. In the Punjab the natives are remarkable for well-arranged white teeth, pawn and betel being not so much used here as in other parts of India. In this quarter of Lahore it is no uncommon event to meet with a fa-keer (a devotee or mendicant) travelling about in a palanquin, clad in silk, with numerous attendants of horse and foot to protect his sacred person. These fanatics are extremely proud, and in general insolent and abusive to Europeans. The Punjab provincial dialect is generally spoken in this country, and is a mixture of Hindostany and Persian, without any peculiar written character.\n\nThe Seiks, or rather Singhs, have in general the Hindoo ease of countenance somewhat altered by their long beards, are as active as the Maharattas, and much more robust, from their living fuller, and enjoying a healthier climate. Their courage is equal to that of any of the natives of India; and, when wrought upon by prejudice or religion, is quite desperate. They are all horsemen, and have no infantry in their own country, except for the defence of their towns and villages; but they generally serve as infantry in foreign armies. They are bold, and rather rough in their address, speaking invariably in a loud bawling tone of voice.\nThe Seik merchant or cultivator, if he be a Singh, differs little in character from the soldier, as he wears arms, and is from education very prompt to use them. The Khalasa Seiks (the original followers of Nanac) differ widely from the Singhs. They are full of intrigue, pliant, versatile, and insinuating; and have all the art of the lower classes of Hindoos employed in business, whom they also so much resemble in their dress and other particulars, that it is difficult to distinguish them. The three religious tribes of Acalies, Shashid, and Nirmala, have each their peculiar manners. The Nanac Poortras, or descendants of Nanac, have the character of a mild, inoffensive race.\n\nThe Seik Hindoo converts continue all those civil usages and customs of the tribes to which they belonged, that they can practice, without infringing the tenets of Nanac, or the institutions of Gooroo Govind. They are very strict respecting diet and intermarriages. The Mahommedan converts, who become Seiks, intermarry with each other; but are allowed to preserve none of their usages, being obliged to eat hog's flesh, and abstain from circumcision. The Seiks or Singhs are forbidden the use of tobacco, but are allowed to indulge in spirituous liquors, which they all drink to excess, it being rare to see a Seik soldier after sunset quite sober. The use of opium and baug (another intoxicating drug) is also quite common. The military Seiks permit the hair of the head and beard to grow to a great length, and are remarkably fond of the flesh of the jungle hog, which is food permitted by their law.\n\nThe conduct of the Seiks to their women differs in no material respect from that of the tribes of Hindoos and Mahommedans from whom they are descended, but may be considered as more lax than that of their ancestors. They are all horsemen, and were formerly well mounted from the Lacky Jungle; but are not now better mounted than the Maharattas.\n\nThe country now possessed by the Seiks, which reaches from 28\u00b0. 40' to beyond 32\u00b0 north, includes all the Punjab, a small part of Mooltan, and most of the tract of country which lies between the Junna and the Sutuleje, in the province of Delhi. It is bounded on the northward and westward by the territories of the King of Cabul; to the eastward by the territories of the mountain Rajahs of Jummoo, Nadone, and Serinagur; and to the southward by the territories of the English government, and the sandy deserts of Hansi Hissar. The Seiks inhabiting the countries between the Sutuleje and the Junna are called Malawa Singhs, and were almost all converted from the Hindoo tribes of Jants and Gujars. The principal chiefs of this tribe are the Rajahs of Patiala, Tahnessir, Kcintal, and Jhind.\n\nThe government of the Seiks, considered in its theory, may be termed a theocracy. The Acalies, or immortals, a class of Seik devotees, have, under the double character of fanatic priests and desperate soldiers, usurped the sole direction of affairs at Amritsir; and are, consequently, leading men in a council, which deliberates under the influence of religious enthusiasm. A chief who is unpopular with the Acalies must not only avoid Amritsir, but is likely to have his dependants taught that it is pious to resist his authority. When a Gooroo-mata, or great national council, is called, all the Seik chiefs assemble at Amritsir, and all private animosities are supposed to cease. The last assembly was called in 1805, when the British army pursued Holkar into the Punjab. The principal chiefs of the Seiks are all descended from Hindoo tribes, there being no instance of a Singh sprung from a Mahommedan family attaining high power.\n\nSeik, properly Sikh or Siesha, is a sanscrit word, which signifies a disciple or devoted follower. Nanac\nShah, the founder of the Seik sect, was born at the village of Fulwundy, in the district of Bhatti, and province of Lahore, A.D. 1469, and died at Kirthipoor Dehra, on the banks of the Rayey. He was succeeded by\n\n2. Gooroo Angud, who wrote some chapters of the sacred book, and died A.D. 1552.\n\n3. Amera Dass a Khetri succeeded him, and died A.D. 1574.\n\n4. Ram Dass, the son of Amera Dass, followed. This Gooroo improved the town of Chak and the famous tank or reservoir, which he called Amritsir, a name signifying the water of immortality. He died in 1581, and was succeeded by his son,\n\n5. Arjoonmal, who rendered himself famous by compiling the Adi Grant\u2019h, or first sacred book of the Seiks, and thus gave a consistent form and order to their religion. He died in 1606, and was followed by his son,\n\n6. Hurgovind. This was the first warlike Gooroo, or priest militant, and is said first to have allowed his followers to eat the flesh of animals, with the exception of the cow. He died in 1644, and had for his successor his grandson,\n\n7. Hurray, whose rule was tranquil, and who in 1661 was succeeded by his son,\n\n8. Hurkrishna, who died at Delhi A.D. 1664. After much opposition his successor was\n\n9. Tegh Behadar. This Gooroo was put to death by the Mogul government in 1675, after having resided for some time in obscurity at Patna.\n\n10. Gooroo Govind, the son of Tigh Bahadur, followed. This chief new modelled the whole government of the Seiks, and converted them into a band of ferocious soldiers; changing their name from Seik to Singh, which signifies a lion, and had before been exclusively assumed by the Rajpoot tribes. He ordered his followers not to cut the hair off their heads, or shave their beards.\n\nAfter much skirmishing with the Mahomedans, during the reign of Aurengzebe, he was expelled from Lahore, and is supposed to have died A.D. 1708, at Naded, in the Deccan. The Seiks consider Gooroo Nanac as the author of their religion, but revere Gooroo Govind as the founder of their worldly greatness and political independence. He was the last acknowledged Gooroo, or religious ruler of the Seiks.\n\nDuring the confusion which took place in Hindostan, on the death of Aurengzebe, in 1707, the Seiks increased in strength, and devastated the country, under the command of a bairaggi (religious mendicant), named Banda, who was at length taken prisoner by the emperor\u2019s officers, and executed. There still remains a sect of Seiks, named Bandai, or followers of Banda, who chiefly reside in Mooltan, Tatta, and other cities on the banks of the Indus.\n\nFrom the death of Banda (about 1711) until the invasion of India by Nadir Shah, we hear nothing of the Seiks, who are related there to have plundered part of that conqueror\u2019s baggage. In the subsequent dissolution of government, which took place in Lahore and the adjacent provinces, the Seik power strengthened; and, during the first Abdalli Afghan invasion, in 1746, they made themselves master of a considerable part of the doab of Rayey and Jalinder. They received many severe checks from the Mahomedans, and in 1672 and 1763 were almost exterminated by Ahmed Shah Abdalli and the Afghans; but from their determined spirit of resistance they always rose superior to their misfortunes, until they acquired their present extensive possessions.\n\nFor many years past they have been mostly occupied by petty internal feuds, transmitted from father to son. Independent of the comparatively larger conquests in which the greater chiefs are occasionally engaged, every village has become an object of dispute; and there are\nfew in the Punjab, the rule of which is not contested by brothers or near relations. In this state their power became so little formidable, that about 1803, General Perron, who commanded a body of troops in the service of Dowlet Row Sindia, intended to have subdued the Punjab, and made the Indus the limit of his possessions. When Holkar fled into the Punjab in 1805, he was pursued there by Lord Lake, upon which occasion a national council of Seik chiefs was called to avert the danger; but very few chiefs attended, and many of the absentee notified their intentions to resist the resolutions of this council.\n\nIt is difficult to ascertain the population of the Seik territories. They boast that they are able to raise more than 100,000 horse; and if it were possible to assemble every Seik horseman this might not be an exaggeration; but there is no chief among them, except Ranjeet Singh of Lahore, that could bring an effective body of 4000 men into the field; and in 1805 this prince's force did not amount to 8000. His army has since become more numerous; but it is composed of materials that have no natural cohesion, and the first serious check it meets with will probably cause its dissolution. With the British government he has continued on good terms since 1809, when a treaty of friendship and alliance was concluded with him by Mr. Metcalfe, on the part of the Bengal government. By the conditions of this treaty the British engaged to have no concern with the subjects or territories of the rajah to the north of the Sutuleje; and the rajah agreed never to maintain, in the territories occupied by him and his dependants to the south of that river, more troops than were necessary to carry on the internal police of the country, and also to abstain from encroaching on any of the chiefs to the south of that boundary. Since that period he has been principally employed in coercing refractory petty chiefs, and in several abortive attempts to achieve the conquest of Cashmere.\n\nThe religion of the Seiks is described as a creed of pure deism, blended with the belief of all the absurdities of Hindoo mythology, and the fables of Mahommedanism. Nanac Shah professed a desire to reform, but not to destroy the religion of the sect in which he was born; and endeavoured to reconcile the jarring faiths of Brahma and Mahommed, by persuading each to reject particular parts of their respective belief and usages.\n\nThe earlier successors of Nanac taught nearly the same doctrine; but Goroo Govind gave a new character to the religion of his followers by many material alterations, and more especially by the abolition of all distinctions of caste. The pride of descent might still remain, and keep up some distinction; but in the religious creed of Goroo Govind all Seiks or Singhs are declared equal. The admission of proselytes, the abolition of caste, the eating all kinds of flesh except that of cows, the form of religious worship, and the general devotion of the Singhs to arms, are all at variance with Hindoo theology, and have rendered the religion of the Seiks as obnoxious to the Brahmans and higher tribes of Hindoos, as it is popular with the lower classes.\n\nThe province of Lahore possesses many advantages over the rest of India, and, under the proper form of government, would alone be sufficient to constitute the basis of a powerful and civilized kingdom. The remarkable richness and fertility of the southern half, intersected by five noble rivers, and the natural strength and temperate climate of the northern, unite circumstances in its favour that are generally in collision. These advantages, added to its topographical situation at the only assailable quarter, point it out as the country from whence Hindostan is to be ruled or conquered. It is, nevertheless, in a most miserable\nstate of cultivation, and one of the most thinly inhabited in India; the whole population dispersed over a surface of 70,000 square miles, probably not exceeding four millions in number. (Malcolm, Foster, Abul Fazel, Treaties, 11th Register, &c.)\n\nLahore.\u2014A city in the province of Lahore, of which it is the capital, situated on the south side of the Ravey River. Lat. 31\u00b0. 50'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 48'. E.\n\nThe river is here about 300 yards broad, but the stream is not deep or rapid, except during the height of the rains. The fort is a place of no strength, without a ditch or any defences for cannon. The walls are lofty, and decorated on the outside; but hastening to ruin, as are most of the private buildings. Lahore is, notwithstanding, still a town of considerable size, with a good bazar; but it is not inhabited by wealthy people, on account of the frequent sackings it has sustained; they have migrated for safety to Amritsar.\n\nThe palace was originally founded by Akbar, and enlarged by his successors. It is now inhabited by Rajah Runjeet Singh, a Seik chief, about 42 years of age, and blind of one eye, which he lost by the smallpox. Across the Ravey at Shah Durra, about two miles north of Lahore, stands the celebrated mausoleum of Jehangeer, within a wall of nearly 600 yards square. It is a magnificent building, 66 paces on each side, and still in tolerably good condition, but much inferior to the Tanje Mahal at Agra. To the southward of this, in the open plain, is to be seen the tomb of Noorjehan Begum, a building 36 paces square. The wells here are above 35 cubits deep.\n\nLahore was first taken by Sultan Baber, A.D. 1520, and was for some time the seat of the Mogul government. Since that period it has undergone many revolutions, and was for a considerable time possessed by the Abdalli Afghans of Kabul, by whom it is named Sikri. For the last 30 years it has been under the Seik domination, whose capital being Amritsar, this city has been much neglected, and in a progressive state of desolation.\n\nTravelling distance from Delhi, 380 miles; from Agra, 517; from Lucknow, 639; from Bombay, 1070; and from Calcutta, 1356 miles. (11th Register, Remel, Leyden, &c.)\n\nLamory Nepaul.\u2014A town in Northern Hindostan, in the territories of the Goorkhali Rajah of Nepaul, situated on the east side of the Sursutty (Sereswati) River. Lat. 27\u00b0. 42'. N. Long. 84\u00b0. 55'. E.\n\nLamjung.\u2014An extensive district in Northern Hindostan, tributary to the Goorkhali Rajah of Nepaul, and having the great Himalaya ridge of mountains for its northern boundary. Like the rest of Northern Hindostan, its surface is elevated and rugged, but comprehends many fertile valleys, through which flow the streams from the northern mountains. The principal towns are Muncundnath and Lantangur, but the district has as yet been but very imperfectly explored.\n\nLampoon. (Lampung).\u2014A district in the south-eastern quarter of the Island of Sumatra, which begins on the west coast at the River Padang-goochie, and extends across the southern extremity of the island as far as Palembang on the north-east side. In the neighbourhood of the rivers the land is overflowed in the rainy season; but the western parts towards Samangka are mountainous, and some of the peaks visible to a considerable distance at sea. This district is best inhabited in the central and mountainous parts, where the inhabitants live secure from the Javanese banditti, who often advance into the country, and commit depredations on the natives, who do not make use of fire arms.\n\nThe inhabitants of Lampoon, of all the Sumatrans, have the strongest resemblance to the Chinese, particularly in the roundness of the face, and construction of the eyes.\nThey are also the fairest on the island, and the women are tallest, and esteemed the most handsome. The manners of the Lampoongs are more free and licentious than those of the native Sumatrans. They eat all kinds of flesh indiscriminately, and the fines and compensations for murder are the same as in the countries of Rejang and Passamah. The Mahommedan religion has made considerable progress among the inhabitants, and most of their villages have mosques in them; yet an attachment to the original superstitions of their country influences them to regard, with particular veneration, the burying-place of their ancestors.\n\nThe Lampoong language is formed by mixing Malay and Batta with a proportion of Javanese. The Dutch claim a domination over the country, it having formerly been tributary to the kings of Bantam, and devolved to them by right of conquest.\n\nTowards the end of the 18th century an officer was sent to the Bay of Lampoon from Batavia to fix on a favourable situation to erect a fort, barracks, and storehouses; but the expedition ended on the burning of a few huts, the inhabitants of which fled to the jungles. On his return the officer reported, that he had discovered no place suitable for an establishment, having seen nothing but impenetrable marshes on the whole extent of the coast, and for some distance up the country. (Marsden, Leyden, Stavorinus, Tombe, &c.)\n\nLANTAGUR.\u2014A town in Northern Hindostan, tributary to the government of Nepaul, in the district of Lamjung. Lat. 29\u00b0 5'. N. Long. 84\u00b0 19'. E.\n\nLAOUR.\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Silhut, 40 miles W. N. W. from the town of Silhut. Lat. 25\u00b0 8'. N. Long. 91\u00b0 2'. E.\n\nLAOS, (Law).\u2014A central country in India beyond the Ganges, extending from the 12th to the 18th degrees of north latitude. To the north it adjoins Lactho and Tunquin; to the south Cambodia; to the east Tunquin and Cochin China; and to the west Siam, and an unexplored region to the north. The exact boundaries of this province have never been ascertained, but it probably consists of a long and large valley, through which flows the great River Mekon, or Cambodia, and separated from the neighbouring kingdoms on the east and west by two ridges of lofty mountains.\n\nOur information respecting the interior of this region is neither copious nor authentic, being chiefly derived from the earlier Portuguese or Dutch writers, or from the uncertain reports of Tunquinese and Chinese merchants communicated to the missionaries. According to the latter the province is extremely thinly inhabited, and but little cultivated, the largest collected population being at the village of Hanniall, amounting to only four or five hundred persons, and these mostly strangers from Tunquin and Cochin China, with few Chinese, settled for the purposes of traffic. The smaller villages are mere groups of huts, and many of the inhabitants are described as still living in a migratory state, without permanent habitations, or any agricultural occupation. In the forests large building timber and cabinet wood of an excellent quality abound, but being remote from water carriage, are allowed to rot where they grow. From a particular species a varnish is extracted by the natives, and sent to China.\n\nThe only external commerce carried on is with Tunquin and Cochin China, to which countries elephants, ivory, wax, bamboos, and cotton are sent from Laos, and in exchange salt, salt fish, oil, some silken stuffs, firearms, and gunpowder, are received. In some parts of the country the inhabitants are very wild, consisting only of small erratic hordes that do not cultivate the earth, but subsist on what it produces naturally.\nThe subjection of this province to the Cochin Chinese empire is little more than nominal; and, on account of the natural strength of the country, and its extreme insalubrity, will probably never be rendered more efficient. The inhabitants, also, on account of their unceasing internal warfare, are of martial habits, and accustomed to the use of fire arms. The wild and wandering tribes of this province are asserted to have neither religion, priests, nor pagodas; but some others are said to worship a being named Nhang, whom they consider as the author of their existence, and the arbiter of their destiny. In Laos the veneration for their ancestors prevails more than in Laetho, but not so much as in Tunquin. The belief in magic is general, and the profession of conjurer (who is also a physician) lucrative.\n\nThe Law language is used by this nation, who are generally termed Lao, and in the plural Laos by the Portuguese writers, from their consisting of different races. The bulk of the Law nation, like the Siamese, consists of two different tribes of people, denominated in Siamese Chong-mai, and Lanchang, which were reported by Koempfer to have been the names of their principal cities. The first of these are termed by the Birmans Yul, and their country Yunshan; and the second Lain-sain, and their country Lainsain Shan.\n\nThe inhabitants of Khomen, or Cambodia, are not supposed to have existed as a polished people so early as the Law. It is from this nation that both the Birmans and Siamese allege they derive their laws, religion, and institutions. It is in the country of the Law that all the celebrated founders of the religion of Buddha are represented to have left their most remarkable vestiges. Ceylon boasts the sacred traces of the left foot of Buddha, on the top of the mountain Amala-sri-pali, or Adam's Peak. Siam exhibits the traces of the right foot on the top of the golden mountain, Swa-na-bapato. Other traces of the sacred step are sparingly scattered over Pegue, Ava, and Aracan; but it is among the Laos that all the vestiges of the founder of this religion seem to be concentrated, and thither devotees resort to worship at the sacred steps of Pra-ku-ku-son, Pra-kon-na-kon, Pra-putha-kat-sop, and Pra-sa-mutta-ko-dum. These Siamese names of the four Buddhas seem to correspond with the Birman Kaukason, Gonagom, Kasyapa, and Gautama; and with the Ceylonese, Kasusanda, Konagom, Kasyapa, and Gautama.\n\nThe Laos language has never been cultivated by Europeans; very few of whom, besides Alexander de Rhodes, have penetrated the country. According to Koempfer, the Law nation do not differ much, either in language or writing, from the Siamese, except that they are unable to pronounce the letters l and r; and Dr. Leyden thinks that their language bears the same relation to the Thay, or Siamese, that the Aracan does to the Birman, and that with the Thay Jhay it accords more fully than with the Thay Proper. The Laos language is represented as abounding in books, especially translations from the Bali; and, if the antiquity of the nation can be depended on, they must be extremely interesting on account of the central situation of the country; but our information, as yet, is too defective to admit of our forming any decided opinion on this subject. If the Laos nation ever existed as a polished society, it must have greatly retrograded, as there is every reason to believe it at present exhibits a state of the utmost barbarity. (De Bissacher, Leyden, F. Buchanan, &c. &c.)\n\nLAPA ISLE.\u2014A small island, one of the Sooloo Archipelago, situated due south from the Island of Sooloo. The land is high and woody, and,\nwith Seassee, forms good shelter from the S. W. and N. E. winds.\n\n**Lassa**, (Lehasa).\u2014A town in Tibet, the capital of a province of the same name. Lat. 29\u00b0. 30' N. Long. 91\u00b0. 25' E.\n\nThis town is the capital of Tibet, and the seat of the Dalai Lama, or pontifical sovereign; but the Chinese keep a garrison here, commanded by a general officer, whose influence supersedes, in a great degree, that of the Lamas. The Lassa territories extend so far west as Kheroo, distant 350 miles W. S. W. which they comprehend; but the whole are, in fact, subject to the Chinese. With the city of Teeshoo Loomboo, in Tibet, south of the Brahmapootra, Lassa exchanges silver bullion for gold dust.\n\nAbout the year 1715 the King of the Eluths invaded this country; Lassa was ravaged, the temples plundered, and all the Lamas, or priests, who were found, were put into sacks, and thrown upon camels, to be transported into Tartary. (Turner, Kirkpatrick, Colebrooke, &c.)\n\n**Laswaree.**\u2014A small village in the province of Delhi, where, on the 1st of November, 1803, a desperate battle was fought between the army under General Lake and that of Bowlet Row Sindia, in which the latter was totally defeated, but with severe loss on the part of the British.\n\n**Latta Latta Isle.**\u2014This is one of the small islands adjacent to Gilolo, and about 25 miles in circumference. Lat. 0\u00b0. 20' S. Long. 126\u00b0. 50' E. The straits which separate this island from that of Tappa are about a mile and a half in length, and in some places not above 46 yards broad. Between Latta Latta and Mandioly the straits are eight miles broad. (Forrest, \u00a7c.)\n\n**Latty Afghany.**\u2014A district which occupies the northern extremity of the province of Ajmeer, with a small portion of the adjacent province of Mooltan, and situated between the 29th and 30th degrees of north latitude. This district is one of the most sandy and sterile in Hindostan, being destitute of rivers, and dependent on deep wells for a scanty supply of moisture. Like other barren territories, it remains in the hands of the original inhabitants, presenting few attractions to invaders.\n\n**Latta Isles.**\u2014A cluster of small islands lying off the west coast of Gilolo, a few minutes to the north of the equinoctial line, and about the 127th degree of east longitude.\n\n**Leyden Isle.**\u2014An island situated off the N. W. coast of Ceylon, subordinate to the district of Jafnapatnam, from which it is separated by a narrow strait. In length it may be estimated at 13 miles, by two and a half the average breadth. Here is excellent pasturage for rearing horses and cattle.\n\n**Leyte Isle.**\u2014One of the southernmost of the Philippines, situated about the 11th degree of north latitude. In length it may be estimated at 95 miles, by 38 the average breadth.\n\n**Limboo.**\u2014A town in the Malay Peninsula, district of Quedal, four miles from Allestar, and chiefly inhabited by Chulias, or natives of the Malabar Coast. During the rainy season the adjacent country is overflowed, which renders it exceedingly productive of fruits, and all sorts of vegetables.\n\n**Limong.**\u2014A district about 70 or 80 miles inland from Bencoolen, in Sumatra, which produces the finest gold and gold dust on the island. The Limong gold merchants repair annually to Bencoolen to purchase opium and other articles, in exchange for which they give gold, containing very little alloy. The gold is sometimes found in dust, and often lodged in a very hard stone. They are ignorant of the principles of assaying or amalgamation, but are extremely expert in separating particles of foreign metals from gold dust, by a very superior acuteness of vision. The gold is not found far beneath the surface.\nThis golden country has never been explored by any European, owing to the impervious nature of the country, and the malignant influence of the climate in the interior. (Macdonald, &c.)\n\n**Lincapen Isle.**\u2014A small island about 20 miles in circumference, situated off the north-east extremity of Palawan Isle. Lat. 11\u00b0. 40'. N. Long. 126\u00b0. 10'. E.\n\n**Lingen Isle.** (Lingga). \u2014 An island situated off the N. E. coast of Sumatra, and intersected by the equinoctial line. In length it may be estimated at 50 miles, by 30 in breadth, but it is of a very irregular shape.\n\nThis island is remarkable for a mountain in its centre, terminating in a fork, on which seamen have bestowed the appellation of Ass's Ears. The eastern ocean in this vicinity is covered with a vast variety of islands, of all forms, sizes, and colours\u2014some alone, and some collected in clusters; many are clothed with verdure; some have tall trees growing on them, while others are mere rocks, the resort of innumerable birds, and whitened with their dung.\n\nThis island is much frequented by piratical Malay praws, the rajah being a chief of that profession. These pirates have a small fort, or blockhouse, at Penobang, the capital, surrounded by water, and having guns mounted. The houses are built on piles, or stakes. Country ships, on a trading voyage to the eastward, call here, and dispose of a few chests of opium, for which they receive in return tin, pepper, and rattans. (Staunton, 11th Register, Elmore, &c.)\n\n**Logoe.** (Lubu).\u2014A small state, situated at the upper part of the Bay of Boni, on the Island of Celebes, and extending down the eastern side inland to the country of the horatoras, or aborigines. To the west it is bounded by Wadjo, and to the north by Touradja. The land is very fertile in rice, and in the rivers much gold is found, the country also producing good iron. A great proportion of the sovereigns of this state have been females, which is no uncommon circumstance in Celebes; but until their recent misfortunes, the power of the Dutch East India Company predominated, although the native chiefs were permitted to govern.\n\n**Logur.** (Lohaghar, the Iron Fort).\u2014A strong hill fort in the province of Aurungabad, 20 miles N. W. from Poonah. Lat. 18\u00b0. 49'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 41'. E.\n\nThe perpendicular height of this rock is too great to be stormed, and the artificial defences erected are not supposed to add to its strength. Lower down than the main body of the fort there is a ledge of hill, but of sufficient height to prevent any attack, the rock being perfectly bare and perpendicular. From the summit the view is very extensive. The sea beyond Bombay appears to the west; inland a chain of hills is visible, whose tops rise into fortified summits as perpendicular as Logur. The strata of these is surprisingly regular, and a line drawn from one hill would meet the corresponding strata of another. The summits are mostly green, and capable of cultivation. Logur has within numerous tanks, and several small streams from the springs above. The magazines are cut in the rock. Esupoor is higher, and only a musket shot from Logur; but, it is said, in the hands of any enemy could not injure the latter, on account of the nature of the surface.\n\nThis fortress formerly belonged to Nanah Furnavese, who at his death entrusted it to the custody of Dondoe Punt; but by the interference of General Wellesley it was surrendered to the Peshwa, who could not otherwise have obtained it, it being esteemed the strongest fort in the Peshwa's dominions. Dondoe Punt declared he had lived in this hill fort 30 years, without ever descending. (Lord Valentia, &c.)\n\n**Logur.**\u2014A town belonging to\nthe Nagpoor Maharattas, in the province of Gundwana, 107 miles S. E. from the city of Nagpoor. Lat. 20\u00b0. 25'. N. Long. 81\u00b0. 10'. E.\n\nLohanna.\u2014A village in the province of Gujrat, near the N. W. boundary, and situated a few miles south from Theraud.\n\nThis place belongs to the Rajah of Doodhur, and contains about 400 houses surrounded by a ditch, yielding a revenue to its chief of about 700 rupees per annum; but it likewise pays contributions to the Coolee thieves of Mondetah and Therawara. It possesses an excellent well, which is an accommodation of great consequence in this arid region.\n\nLohurdunga.\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, district of Chuta Nagpoor, 223 miles W. N. W. from Calcutta. Lat. 23\u00b0. 28'. N. Long. 85\u00b0. 2'. E. Near to this place is a pass into the western hills, which bound the district.\n\nLolldong.\u2014A pass in the province of Delhi, where it is separated from Serinagur by a rivulet, which forms the boundary in this quarter, being 15 miles S. E. from Hurdwar, and 110 N. E. from Delhi. Lat. 29\u00b0. 52'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 16'. E.\n\nThe country from Nujibabad to this place is chiefly a waste overrun with low wood, and ill supplied with water, there being none in the space from Rannagur to the neighbourhood of Lolldong. The road from hence northward is by a N. W. course through the mountains. From hence to the Ganges the country forms a chain of close woody mountains, containing a few miserable hamlets; and abounding with elephants, which are not to be found on the west side of the Jumna.\n\nIn 1774, after the total defeat sustained by the Rohillahs at Cutterah, Fyzoolah Khan, with the remains of their army, retreated to this pass, and was pursued by the British, where ultimately a treaty of peace and amity was concluded. (Foster, Rennel, &c. &c.)\n\nLollara.\u2014A large village in the province of Gujrat, district of Wernear, situated about 30 miles S. E. from Rahdunpoor.\n\nThis place contains about 1000 houses, inhabited principally by Na-roda Rajpoots, Mahomedans, and Rajpoots, who have been converted to that faith. On the east side a fine sheet of water extends above a mile; on the west side there is a handsome mosque. The garrison stationed for the defence of Lollara, consists of a Sindean jemmadaur, and 10 or 12 horsemen. At this village is observed the great superiority of the cattle of the north part of Gujrat over those of the south, which pre-eminence prevails throughout the whole of Kakreze, Puttenwara, Werrear, Neyer, and Deesa. In Kakreze a pair of the finest bullocks may be purchased for 120 rupees, which at Baroda, or Surat, would cost from three to 500 rupees. Between this place and Somnee extensive fields of wheat and cotton are seen.\u2014(Macnurdo, &c.)\n\nLolljee.\u2014A town in Tibet, in the Narytamo province, situated on the north side of the Brahmapootra, here named the Sanpoo River. Lat. 30\u00b0. 15'. N. Long. 84\u00b0. 26'. E.\n\nLombhook Isle.\u2014An island in the Eastern Seas, situated between the eighth and ninth degrees of south latitude, and intersected by the 116th of east longitude. It is separated on the west from Bally by the Straits of Lombhook, and on the east from Sumblawa by the Straits of Allass; and in length may be estimated at 53 miles, by 45 the average breadth. Like the rest of the Sunda Islands it is distinguished by high mountains, and is well covered with wood and verdure. The navigation through the Straits of Lombhook is extremely difficult and dangerous, but that by the Straits of Allass (the native name of which is Loboagee) is the most commodious passage through the chain of Sunda Islands to the east of Java.\n\nThis island is very populous, and extremely well cultivated, the rice\nagriculture being conducted, as in the Carnatic, by means of large tanks or reservoirs, and the crops so productive that large quantities are exported. The inhabitants also carry on a very extensive commerce with all the Malay Islands, and particularly with Java and Borneo. At the town of Bally, in the Straits of Allass, a considerable traffic is carried on with the European ships bound to the eastward, which procure here refreshments in great abundance; but the natives want few articles of European manufacture, unless it be firearms and ammunition. For poultry, and the minor description of provisions, the natives will accept in exchange knives and coarse cutlery to a certain extent; but for bullocks, and provisions of a more expensive kind, dollars are required. The inhabitants of this island Captain Forrest calls Gentoos, but it is not clear what meaning he attached to that term. They are more civilized than the generality of the population of the Eastern Islands, and have always preserved their independence against the Dutch, although so near to them. (Stavorinus, Forrest, Bligh, &c. &c.)\n\nLomblem Isle.\u2014One of the Sunda chain of islands, situated between the large islands of Floris and Timor, and the eighth and ninth degrees of south latitude. It is an island of considerable dimensions, being in length about 50 miles, by 16 miles the average breadth; but it has never been explored, and remains nearly unknown.\n\nLonsir.\u2014A village in the province of Gujrat, the property of the Rajah of Wankauceer, and situated about 15 miles N. E. from that town. In the centre of Lonsir is a square building perforated with loop holes for matchlocks, and supplied with water from a large tank.\n\nFrom hence to Choovera the country has a very wild appearance, the hills are bleak, and partly covered with a wild prickly shrub. The plains are overspread with short thick jungle, presenting few traces of cultivation. The villages are miserable in the extreme, and being generally placed on the most prominent point of a black rocky mountain, are only distinguishable by the smoke ascending from their wretched hovels. The inhabitants of these villages are chiefly Catties, Bheels, and Rickbarries. A similar description of country extends all the way to the Choteela Hills. (Macmurdo, &c.)\n\nLonfar Pulo Isle.\u2014An island in the Indian Ocean, separated from the Peninsula of Malacca by a narrow strait. Lat. 7\u00b0 30'. N. Long. 99\u00b0 E.\n\nThis island, and some of the neighbouring ones, are inhabited by a race of Icthyophagi, denominated by the Malays Orang Laut, or men of the sea, because their constant employment is on or near that element, from which they procure their sole subsistence. Their manners are simple and inoffensive. Agriculture is wholly unknown to them, the inconsiderable quantity of rice that enters into their diet being procured by bartering fish with the Malays. This people are not yet converted to the Mahommedan religion, nor is it ascertained that they have any distinct notion of religious worship. In person and complexion they differ from the Malays only in the effect which the peculiarity of their diet produces, covering their bodies with a scorbustic eruption, such as is found, though less generally, among the Malays themselves. Their language differs from the Malay only in being more simple and primitive. (Edinburgh Review, &c.)\n\nLong Island.\u2014A small island about 40 miles in circumference, situated off the coast of Papua, between the main and Mysory Island, and about the first degree of south latitude. Like the preceding, it is almost wholly unknown.\n\nLookiang River.\u2014A river in the Birman dominions, formerly supposed to be a great branch of the Irawaddy River, but which has\nno communication with it. On entering the Ava territories, from the north, it assumes the name of Thalayun, and falls into the sea at Martaban.\n\nLoonghee.\u2014A town in the Birman empire, situated on the east side of the Irawaddy. Lat. 19\u00b0. 41'. N. Long. 19\u00b0. 58'. E.\n\nThe soil in this neighbourhood is very favourable for cotton, with which many fields are planted, where the shrub grows strong and healthy. The cattle used for tillage and draught in this part of Ava are oxen, and only one pair are put into a plough, which resembles the common Hindostan one. In their large waggons they yoke four or six, which are often driven at a hand gallop, by a country girl standing up in the vehicle; who manages the reins and a long whip, with equal ease and dexterity. This is a novel sight to a person accustomed to the slow moving machines of India, in which the women are generally too timorous to ride, much less to attempt to guide. (Symes, &c.)\n\nLooseegna.\u2014A small town in the province of Bahar, district of Rangur, 90 miles S. by W. from Patna. Lat. 24\u00b0. 20'. N. Long. 84\u00b0. 58'. E.\n\nLouer.\u2014A town belonging to the Maharattas, in the province of Aurungabad, situated on the banks of the Ghirah River. Lat. 26\u00b0. 23'. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 27'. E.\n\nLowashan.\u2014A province in the Birman empire, situated between the 22nd and 24th degrees of north latitude. To the north-east it is bounded by the province of Yunnan in China; to the south by the country of Yunshan; and to the west by Ava Proper. It is intersected by the Lookiang or Thalayun River, which flows into it from China, and the principal town is Kiaintoun. The country to the east of the river is mountainous, and but little known even to the Birmans.\n\nLowyah.\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, district of Bettiah, 74 miles N. N. W. from Patna, Lat. 26\u00b0. 36'. N. Long. 84\u00b0. 50'. E.\n\nLubeck Isle.\u2014A small island situated off the northern coast of Java, and almost surrounded by a cluster of rocks and rocky islets. Lat. 5\u00b0. 48'. S. Long. 112\u00b0. 45'. N. This island is populous, and carries on a brisk trade with Java and Borneo.\n\nLuckput Bunder.\u2014A town in the province of Cutch, situated on a salt creek or river which communicates with the Gulf of Cutch, but only navigable for small vessels. Lat. 23\u00b0. 47'. N.\n\nThe fort of Luckput Bunder stands on the western brow of a hill, which rises from a swampy plain, about a mile and a half from Luckput Bunder River. In figure it is an irregular polygon, defended by round towers, and built of hard brown stone. The eastern side is flanked by a hill of the same material, and containing a large tank, but which becomes dry towards the end of March. There are several other tanks within the fort, but the water is not reckoned good.\n\nThe walls of the fort are of a considerable height, but not thick; and there are only six pieces of cannon mounted on the works. To the westward of the principal gate a wall divides the inside of the fort into two parts, the western only being inhabited. It is not supposed to contain more than 2000 inhabitants, 500 of whom are sepoys, and it is at present a place of little trade. It is nevertheless the principal town on the road from Hyderabad, the capital of Sind, to Mandavie on the Gulf of Cutch. The most convenient time for performing this journey is during the months of July and August, when the creeks are navigable for flat bottomed boats to Alibunder; where a small neck of land separates the fresh water from the salt water creek, which runs down to Luckput Bunder, over which isthmus the boats are easily carried. (Maxfield, &c.)\nLUCKYPOOR, (Lakshmipur).\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Tipperah, situated a few miles inland from the east bank of the Megna, with which it communicates by a small river. Lat. 22\u00b0.56'. N. Long. 96\u00b0.43'. E. Baftas and other coarse cotton goods of an excellent and substantial fabric are manufactured in this neighbourhood, which is also very fertile and productive, being on the whole one of the cheapest places in the Company's dominions.\n\nThe River Megna near to this expands to a breadth exceeding 10 miles, and during the height of the rains, when the shoaly islands are submerged, appears more like an inland sea of fresh water in motion than a river. In 1763 it rose six feet above its usual level, and occasioned an inundation that swept away the houses, cattle, and inhabitants of a whole district.\n\nLUCKNOW, (Lakshmanavati).\u2014A district in the Nabob of Oude's territories, adjacent to the city of Lucknow, and situated between the 26th and 27th degrees of north latitude. The land here is generally flat and sandy, and, after a storm, is covered with puddles of water. Near to Bengermow the country is more pleasing, being tolerably well cultivated and slightly undulated. Wheat and barley are the principal crops, and the district is covered with clumps of mango trees. Over the small river Sye is a bridge of 15 arches, an excellent specimen of Mahommedan architecture; and it is besides watered by the Ganges, the Goggrah, and the Goomty.\n\nThe towns in this division of Oude are mostly built of brick, with ruins far more extensive than the inhabited part; and there still remains the debris of many extensive cities, the vestiges of which are only to be traced by large mounts of brick dust. From this district are procured many of the best recruits for the British Sepoy corps, the natives being more robust, and of a more martial disposition than the Bengalese. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Lucknow, containing 55 mahals; measurement, 3,307,126 beegals; revenue, 80,716,120 dams; seyurghal, 4,572,566 dams.\" (Lord Valentia, Tenant, Abul Fazel, &c.)\n\nLUCKNOW.\u2014A city in the province of Oude, of which it is the capital and residence of the Nabob. Lat. 26\u00b0. 51'. N. Long. 80\u00b0. 55'. E. This town stands on the south side of the Goomty, which is navigable for boats of a common size at all seasons of the year, and falls into the Ganges between Benares and Gazypoor. The streets where the lower classes reside are sunk 10 or 12 feet below the surface, and are so narrow that two carts cannot pass, being likewise filthy in the extreme. The different palaces of the nabob, the great mosques, and burying places, display considerable splendour, having gilt roofs and architecture loaded with ornaments.\n\nOn the death of the Nabob Sujah ud Dowlah, in 1774, the late Nabob Asoph ud Dowlah removed the seat of government to this place from Fyzabad, the former capital. The bankers and men of property accompanied the court; and Lucknow, in a very few years, became one of the largest and richest towns in Hindostan, while its predecessor decayed with a proportionate rapidity. In 1800 the population was estimated to exceed 300,000; but it probably has since diminished, on account of the decreasing splendour of the nabob's court, and consequent limited expenditure.\n\nAmong the curiosities in this neighbourhood is Constantia, the residence of the late General Martin, which is said to have cost 150,000l. sterling. To the house is annexed a very noble garden and extensive mango clump; but the country around is a barren sand and dead flat. On his decease the furniture was sold, and the girandoles and mirrors now adorn the government house in Calcutta.\nThe nabob has also a menagerie, in which variety or utility has not been so much attended to as the oddities of nature. The rhinoceros is the most remarkable animal in this collection. Near to the stables a very large breed of Gujrat bullocks is kept, the introduction of which among the peasants generally would be of infinite advantage to a country, where the draught cattle are so small and weak as in the Oude province.\n\nThe body of the late Asoph ud Dowlah lies interred in a religious sepulchre, lighted by a vast number of wax tapers, and having the grave strewned with flowers and gilt paper. At one side is a censer, with various perfumes; on the other, his sword and waistband; and opposite to his head lies his turban, and a copy of the Koran. The grave is covered with rich bread of barley, from Mecca; and verses from the Koran are chanted day and night. Lucknow is mentioned by Abul Fazel as being a town of considerable note during the reign of Aeber. It stands about 650 miles, travelling distance by the nearest road, from Calcutta; and from hence to where the Ganges joins the ocean all is one vast plain. Travelling distance from Delhi, 280; from Agra, 202; and from Benares, 189 miles. (Tennant, Lord Valenta, Remel, &c.)\n\nLuconia Isle, (Luzon). \u2014 The largest of the Philippines.\u2014See Luzon.\n\nLudehaunah.\u2014A town on the northern frontier of the Delhi province, situated on the banks of the Sutuleje River, 180 miles N. N. W. from the city of Delhi, and 120 S. E. from Lahore. Lat. 30\u00b0. 53'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 32'. E. The climate at this place is excessively cold for four or five months of the year; and, in the summer season, extremely hot, with hot winds, both seasons being in extremes. The rains are abundant. Ludehaundah is the most remote military station to the north west which the British possess in India, a detachment having been established here in 1808 to coerce the adjacent Seik chiefs.\n\nLumghanat.\u2014An Afghan district in the province of Cabul, situated about the 34th degree of north latitude, and extending along the south side of the Kameh, or Cabul River. The chief towns are Jelalabad and Irjah. Lumghanat, with the adjoining district of Kameh, appears to be the region described by Dr. Leyden in the 11th volume of the Asiatic Researches, under the appellation of Ningarhar. When invaded by Sebuctaghi, in A.D. 997, this was a Hindoo district; and it still retains a peculiar dialect, named the Lumghaneese.\n\nLunawara, (Lavanavara, a Salt Region).\u2014A town in the province of Gujrat, district of Gudara, 65 miles E. by N. from Ahmedabad. Lat. 23\u00b0. 5'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 46'. E. On the 14th of November, 1808, a treaty was concluded with the rajah by the British government, which liberated him from the tribute he had before paid to Dowlet Row Sindia. In consideration of this benefit he engaged to support a body of troops for the defence of their own dominions; and, in case of necessity, to assist the British, whose enemies he considered as his own.\n\nLuzon Isle, (or Luconia).\u2014The largest of the Philippine Islands, on which stands Manila, the metropolis. This island is situated between the 13th and 19th degrees of north latitude, and extends from the 120th to the 124th degrees of east longitude. It is of a very irregular form, but may be estimated at 400 miles in length, by 115 the average breadth.\n\nThe greater part of this island is mountainous, being intersected from north to south by an immense chain, from which diverge various ramifications that spread over the whole island; in some places forming detached mountains, like insulated cones, in the midst of extensive plains. The whole of this elevated region, occupying a great part of the interior,\nLuzon Isle\n\nIt is either a wilderness, or inhabited by a wretched people under no control from the Spanish government.\n\nThere are on Luzon several volcanoes, particularly that of Mayore, between the provinces of Albay and Camarines, which has the figure of a sugar-loaf, and is of such altitude that it may be discovered a great distance at sea. The De Taal is of a similar form, and stands in the middle of a large lake, named Bombon. Its present appearance indicates as if the mountain, on the summit of which was the volcano, had sunk; part of it, however, still remaining considerably elevated above the waters of the surrounding lake. There are many warm springs and small lakes, indicating an internal combustion, from which probably originate the earthquakes to which the island is subject. From their numerous orifices, ashes, stones, sand, water, and lava, are erupted, inundating and destroying the neighbouring fields. In 1650 an earthquake happened, which overturned almost all Manilla, with the exception of the church and convent of St. Augustine. In one part of the island a hill was raised from its foundations, and fell on the town, burying under its mass all the inhabitants. In some parts the earth sunk; and in others torrents of sand burst forth, overwhelming man and beast; and the succession of earthquakes altogether lasted 60 days. In 1754 there happened another terrible earthquake; and the Taal, which is in the middle of the Lake Bombon, in the province of Batangas, threw out such immense quantities of cinders, as completely to ruin four towns which were situated near the lake, and compelled the inhabitants to retire a league further into the interior. Many other severe shocks followed, accompanied by loud reports, like the artillery of contending squadrons; and the atmosphere was entirely obscured by the sand and ashes discharged.\n\nAlthough situated within the tropics, the climate of this island is temperate, and the soil fertile. Indigo, tobacco, and sugar, all of an excellent quality, are produced in abundance; and might, if encouraged, be increased to almost any amount. The sea-coast is indented by many bays and commodious harbours; but that of Manilla, which is one of the finest in the world, is the only one frequented by ships of burden. There are several lakes in the interior, the most considerable of which is named by the Spaniards Laguna de Bay. The Manilla River, which may be ascended in boats, issues from this lake, which is said to be 30 leagues in circumference. In the middle of the lake is an island, where many Indian families reside, who subsist by fishing, and are described as being of a gentle disposition, and somewhat disposed to industry. Although converted by the Spaniards, they preserve their ancient laws and customs, by which they continue to be regulated, each village being superintended by one of their chiefs, nominated by the Spaniards.\n\nTo the east of this lake there are said to be extensive plains, thinly scattered over with villages, and intersected by deep streams; the natives carrying on unceasing warfare with the neighbouring tribes. Many expeditions have been undertaken by the Spaniards against the mountain Indians of Luzon; but to so little purpose, that they remain independent to this hour. They carry on a small traffic with the Spaniards in gold, wax, and tobacco, in exchange for cattle; and the Augustinian friars have succeeded in converting a few who live in the hamlets near to the mountains.\n\nBefore the Spaniards arrived the district in the neighbourhood of Manilla was occupied by the Tagala nation, inhabiting many towns and villages, and governed by petty chiefs. To the north of this people the Spaniards found the Pampangas, the Zambales, the Pangasinan, Ylo-\ncos, and Cayagan tribes. Each of these nations formed a different community, with a particular dialect of the same language, and distributed in mud villages, without a king or supreme head; the power being parcelled out among numberless petty chiefs or rajahs, whose particular authority was seldom obeyed by more than 50 or 100 families. After the conquest each of these nations was constituted into a province, governed by a Spanish alcalde mayor. To the east of the Tagala are the Camarines, whose country has been divided into two districts; that of Albay, and that of Camarines, each under an alcalde mayor. In the vicinity of Manilla the original natives are now much intermixed with Chinese.\n\nThe Spaniards have several establishments scattered over the island, consisting generally of monks, for the propagation of the Roman Catholic religion. The native inhabitants under their government exist in a state of sloth and inactivity, and appear indifferent to either virtue or vice. Indolence and timidity are the characteristics of the great majority; but as there are parts which the Spaniards have never been able to subdue, they are probably possessed by races of a different description. Among the mountains and recesses of the interior, there is said to be a tribe approaching nearly to a state of nature, who roost on trees, and do not even associate in families.\n\nWere this island adequately cultivated and better governed, it might supply subsistence for a numerous population, and reign paramount over all the neighbouring Archipelago. As it is, the inhabitants are comparatively few in number, destitute of energy, and despised by their neighbours, the Malay pirates, who have long considered Luzon and the other Philippines as the quarter from whence slaves may be procured, with the least risk and greatest facility. (Zuniga, Sonnerat, La Peyrouse, &c. &c.)\n\nMACASSAR, (Mungkasar).\u2014A kingdom situated on the south-west coast of the Island of Celebes, which, before its conquest by the Dutch, comprehended all the coast from Boeleboele in the Bay of Boni to the Point of Lassem; thence westward to the Point of Touratte, or Tanakeke; and along the west coast northward to Tanette, or Agauandje. Inland it reached as far as Boni and Soping; and throughout the whole the original Macassar language prevailed.\n\nThe power of this state was at its highest about the middle of the 17th century, when its princes not only governed great part of Celebes, but had likewise rendered Loma, Mandelly, Bima, Tambora, Dompo, and Sangar, tributary; and had conquered Booton, Bungay, Gapi, the Xulla Islands, and Sumbhawa. They also possessed Salayr, which had been given to Macassar by Baab Ullah, the King of Fernate. At that period the sovereigns of Macassar were in strict alliance with the inhabitants of Bali, and coined the first gold coins, which were probably the gold maas, of the value of 60 Dutch stivers.\n\nThe Portuguese obtained a footing in this province so early as 1512, at which time it does not appear that the Mahommedan religion had any existence in Celebes; but we have no information respecting the prior doctrines of the natives, who had attained a considerable degree of civilization. Subsequent to this period the Malays, being allowed to settle on the island and erect a mosque, their religion made such progress, that in 1603 the Macassar Rajah, with the whole Macassar nation, by one of the most singular revolutions on record, renounced their ancient religion; and not only adopted that of Mahommed, but compelled a number of the interior states to imitate their example.\n\nThe empire of Macassar has been entirely subverted by the Dutch, but\nthe inhabitants still retain their martial character and undaunted courage. The finishing blow was given to its independence in the year 1778. The kings of Macassar had formerly always a new name given to them after their death, and their successors were nominated before their interment.\n\nThe Macassars, like all the other Bugess tribes, are much addicted to traffic and a seafaring life. They build their prows very tight, by dovelling their planks together as coopers do the parts that form the head of a cask. Between the pieces they put the bark of a particular plant, which swells; after which they fit timbers to the planks, as at Bombay, but do not rabbet the planks as is done there. They have their bow lowered, or cut down in so awkward a manner, that, being often under water, a bulk-head is raised abaft the stem to keep off the sea. In size they seldom exceed 50 tons, and are rigged with a tripod mast, made of three stout bamboos, carrying a high pointed sail. The dialect of Macassar differs considerably from the Bugess Proper. (Starorinus, Forrest, Leyden, Marsden, &c.)\n\nMacassar.\u2014The chief settlement of the Dutch on the Island of Celebes, named by them Fort Rotterdam, and situated on the south-west coast of the island. Lat. 5\u00b0 10' S. Long. 119\u00b0 20' E.\n\nThe fortress stands about 800 yards from the beach, where a pier-head extends for unloading ships. The walls are high, strong, and constructed of free-stone. The Chinese live altogether in one street, which is named after them. The town lies in an extensive plain, which reaches to the foot of a range of high mountains eight Dutch miles to the eastward; and is covered with rice fields and pasture grounds, being watered by small canals from the largest streams which descend from the mountains. In 1730 the jurisdiction of the Dutch Company extended from Sambong Java to what is called the Kraal; thence, northward, along the salt marshes behind Bontualack, as far as the River Patenga Loang.\n\nWhile possessed by the Dutch the principal exports from hence were rice, sapun wood, and radjang; but the settlement was considered of great importance for the security of the Moluccas and spice trade. From hence also the Dutch transported many slaves to their colonies on the Island of Java and elsewhere. They allowed a Chinese junk to come annually to Macassar direct from China; from whence nankeens, silk goods, sugar, tea, china-ware, and some smaller articles, were imported; which, if not permitted openly, would have been clandestinely introduced. The Dutch European imports were very trifling, and consisted principally of fire-arms, ammunition, and coarse cutlery; but many articles, the produce of Java, were brought for the use of the garrison. In 1777 the establishment here consisted of 57 persons in civil, and three in ecclesiastical employments, 13 surgeons and assistants, 27 artillery-men, 178 seamen and marines, 502 soldiers, and 72 mechanics; in all 852 Europeans\u2014a number disproportionately large for any benefit yielded by the settlement.\n\nThis part of the Celebes coast was first visited by the Portuguese in 1512, where they soon afterwards established a settlement; and remained until 1668, when they were expelled, and the town of Macassar captured by the Dutch, who had previously made some progress in the province, and had long annoyed them by sea. In 1660, the Dutch understanding that the Jesuits had a large property on board a Portuguese fleet richly laden, attacked them in the harbour of Macassar, and sunk five, but brought off only one. The English East India Company's agents established a factory here in 1615; the artifices of the Dutch soon compelled them to abandon it, which was of no great detriment, as it scarcely furnished any article fit for\nthe then state of the European market.\n\nIn 1739 there was a general conspiracy of the Buggesses, the Macassars, the Wadjorese, and several other smaller states, against the Dutch, when they besieged Fort Rotterdam; but ultimately failed, like many other coalitions, for want of union. In 1780 the Buggesses again made a desperate attack on Fort Rotterdam, but were beat off with great loss; and in 1810 it surrendered to a British squadron without any resistance. (Stavorinus and Notes, Bruce, Forrest, &c.)\n\nMACASSAR, (STRAITS OF).\u2014This arm of the sea, for it cannot with propriety be called a strait, separates the Island of Borneo from that of Celebes, and extends above 300 miles from north to south, with a breadth in general exceeding 120 miles, except at the northern extremity, where it contracts to about 60 miles. This part of the Eastern Seas abounds with shoals, rocks, and rocky islands; yet it is much frequented by ships bound to China late in the season, the western passage along the coast of Borneo being the best and most explored. In January and February strong winds generally blow from the northward, forcing a strong current through this strait to the southward.\n\nMACAO.\u2014This Portuguese settlement is situated at the southern extremity of an island, separated only by rivers from the southern continent of China. Lat. 22\u00b0. 13'. N. Long. 113\u00b0. 35'. E.\n\nThe town of Macao is connected with the remainder of the island by a long neck of land not exceeding 100 yards across, which was probably originally formed by the sand thrown up by the beating of the waves on each side. Across it there is a wall erected, which projects into the water at each end, with a gate and guardhouse in the middle for Chinese soldiers. The walls are constructed of oyster-shells, which are found in these seas of an enormous size; and are used, after being divided into thin laminae and polished, instead of window-glass, at Macao, and throughout the southern provinces of China.\n\nThe Portuguese territory on this island does not exceed eight miles in circuit, and beyond it they are seldom allowed to pass. Its greatest length from N. E. to S. W. being under three miles, and its breadth less than half a mile. The broadest part of this little peninsula to the northward of the town is cultivated by the Chinese. It is nearly flat, and of a light sandy soil; but by the skill and industry of the cultivators it produces culinary vegetables, European and Asiatic, sufficient for the settlement. The market is well supplied with grain from the Chinese part of the island, and sometimes from the main land; and all the arts of comfort or convenience are exercised by the Chinese, the Portuguese being devoted to trade and navigation.\n\nFrom this spot the Portuguese for a long time carried on a considerable commerce, not only with the Chinese empire, where they alone of all Europeans resorted, but likewise with the other countries in Eastern Asia; such as Japan, Tungquin, Cochin China, and Siam. The settlement then prospered; and the vestiges which remain of public and private buildings prove a decline from a superior state. The harbour does not admit vessels of great burthen, which generally anchor six or seven miles off, the town bearing W. N. W. If there be any women on board, application must be made to the bishop and synod of Macao for permission to land them, as they will not be permitted by the Chinese to go further up the river. A voyage from Macao to Calcutta, taking the inside passage to the westward of the Paracels, generally last a month; but it has been made in 25 days, including two days delay at Malacca, and three at Prince of Wales's Island.\n\nThe Portuguese inhabitants still\nfit out a few vessels, and others lend their names for a trifling consideration to foreigners belonging to the Canton factories, who require to be nominally associated with the Portuguese to be allowed to trade from the port. The money spent in the settlement by the Canton factors, who live hospitably, is also of great advantage. The whole population amounts to about 12,000, of whom considerably more than half are Chinese. The garrison, which is composed mostly of mulattoes and blacks, amounts to about 300 men, with a number of supernumerary officers. The public administration is vested in a senate composed of the bishop, the judge, and a few of the principal inhabitants, but the Chinese mandarin is the real governor. The bishop has great sway, and contributes to give a tone of devotion and religious observances, which is the only material occupation of a great majority of the Catholic laity, who do not exceed 4000 persons. For this number there are 13 churches or chapels, and 50 ecclesiastics, three monasteries for men, and a convent of about 40 nuns, besides missionaries from France and Italy. The Chinese possess two temples at Macao, which are overshadowed by thick trees, so as not to be visible at a distance.\n\nIn the senate house, which is two stories high, and built of granite, are several columns of the same material, with Chinese characters engraved, signifying a solemn cession of the place from the Emperor of China. This is, however, an insufficient guard against the encroachments of the Chinese, who sometimes exact duties in the port of Macao, and punish individuals within their walls for crimes committed against Chinese; added to these, they sometimes march with idolatrous processions through the town, which is scarcely less offensive to a Portuguese. The latter are, in fact, kept under such restraint, that they dare not repair a house without permission from the Chinese. Whenever resistance is attempted, the mandarin, who commands in the little fort within sight of Macao, stops immediately the supply of provisions until they submit.\n\nThere is a cave below the loftiest eminence in the town, called Camoen's Cave, from a tradition current in the settlement, that this celebrated poet wrote the Lusiad in that spot. This cave is now in a garden, opposite to which in the middle of the harbour is a small circular island, which formerly belonged to the Jesuits of Macao. On this island were erected a church, a college, and an observatory, with a botanic and a kitchen garden; but all these improvements fell to decay with the society, and are scarcely now to be traced. The harbour in which this little island lies is called the Inner Harbour, by way of distinction from the opposite or outer bay, where ships are exposed to bad weather, especially during the N.E. monsoon. It has been observed by mariners that this bay is gradually growing shallower. It opens on one side into a basin formed by four islands, in which Lord Anson's ship lay to be repaired, but no such ship could enter it at present.\n\nThe Portuguese first obtained possession of Macao in A.D. 1586. At this period a pirate had seized an adjacent island, but was expelled by the Portuguese; in gratitude for which the Chinese Emperor made them a gift of the small peninsula on which the town now stands. (Staunton, Elmore, La Peyrouse, &c., &c.)\n\nMacclesfield Shoal.\u2014A shoal in the Eastern Seas, situated principally between the 15th and 16th degrees of north latitude, and the 114th and 115th of east longitude. The depth of water is not less than 10, and in many places more than 50 fathoms.\n\nMacherla.\u2014A town in the province of the Carnatic, district of Palnaud, 108 miles south from Fly-\nderabad.

This was the first town acquired by the Seiks during the government of their martial, Gooroo Govind.\n\nMactan Isle.\u2014A small island, one of the Philippines, about 10 miles in circumference, situated to the east of Zebu Isle. Lat. 10\u00b0. 30'. N. Long. 123\u00b0. 48'. E. Here Magellan was killed, A.D. 1521, when on his return from America, by a westerly course.\n\nMadigheshy.\u2014A fortress in the Mysore Rajah's territories, situated on a rock of very difficult access. Lat. 13\u00b0. 48'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 16'. E. At the foot of the rock is a fortified town, containing near 200 houses. This place originally belonged to a polygar family, a lady of which, named Madigheshy, having burned herself with her husband's corpse, her name was given to the town. This practice is very rare in the table land above the Ghauts. Madigheshy was afterwards governed by rannies, or female sovereigns, from whom it was conquered by the family of Chicappa Gauda, and at last absorbed into Hyder's government.\n\nThe country around is covered with little hills overgrown with copse wood. The vallies shew marks of having been formerly in a state of cultivation, and exhibit the ruined villages of their former inhabitants. Ever since the devastation committed by Purseram Bhow's army, and the subsequent famine, they have been nearly waste, but are fast recovering under the Mysore Rajah's government. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nMadghery, (Madhu-giri).\u2014A hill fort and town in the Rajah of Mysore's territories. Lat. 13\u00b0. 33'. N. Long. 71\u00b0. 15'. E.\n\nOn the fall of the Bijanagur empire this place belonged to a polygar named Chicuppa Gauda, but more than a century ago it came into the possession of the Mysore Rajah's family. Mul Rajah built a fortress of stone, the prior one having been of mud. This place had been so often plundered, that prior to the conquest of the Mysore, in 1799, it was reduced very low, but is now fast recovering. Bulwurt Row, one of Purseram Bhow's officers, besieged it five months, but was unable to take it.\n\nIn this neighbourhood, on the best land, when there is plenty of water, two crops of rice are raised annually. The mode of cultivation here differs from that followed to the south of Nundydroog, and also from that to the west of the ridge of hills towards Sera. In a black clay soil, which contains small masses of limestone, cotton is cultivated, but the quantity is small. In the kitchen gardens maize, transplanted ragy, wheat, turmeric, capsicum, onions, garlic, and hemp, are cultivated\u2014the last being only used to intoxicate. Good soil fit for kitchen gardens pays a rent of from 12s. to 21s. per acre. In this vicinity all accounts are kept in Canteraya pagodas. (F. Buchanan, &c. &c.)\n\nMADRAS, (Mandirraj).\n\nA city in the Carnatic province,\nand the capital of the British possessions in the Deccan and south of India. Lat. 13\u00b0. 5'. N. Long. 80\u00b0. 25'. E.\n\nThe approach to Madras from the sea is very striking. The low flat sandy shores extending to the north and south, and the small hills that are seen inland; the whole exhibiting an appearance of barrenness, which is much improved on closer inspection. The beach seems alive with the crowds that cover it. The public offices and store houses erected near to the beach are fine buildings, with colonnades to the upper stories, supported on arched bases, covered with the beautiful shell mortar of Madras\u2014hard, smooth, and polished. Within a few yards of the sea the fortifications of Fort George present an interesting appearance, and at a distance minarets and pagodas are seen mixed with trees and gardens. With all these external advantages it would be difficult to find a worse place for a capital than Madras, situated as it is on the margin of a coast where runs a rapid current, and against which a tremendous surf breaks even in the mildest weather. The site of Pondicherry is in every respect superior, and is placed in a rich and fertile country, besides having the great advantage of being to windward, the loss of which was severely felt by the British settlers during the hard-fought wars of the 18th century. Yet, however inconvenient, the expense of removal at this late period precludes all idea of a change.\n\nThe boats used for crossing the surf are large and light, and made of very thin planks, sewed together with straw in the seams instead of caulking, which it is supposed would render them too stiff; the great object being to have them as flexible as possible, to yield to the waves like leather. When within the influence of the surf, the coxswain stands up, and beats time with great agitation with his voice and foot, while the rowers work their oars backwards, until overtaken by a strong surf curling up, which sweeps the boat along with a frightful violence. Every oar is then plied forwards with the utmost vigour to prevent the wave from taking the boat back as it recedes; until at length, by a few successive surfs, the boat is dashed high and dry on the beach.\n\nThe boats belonging to ships in the roads sometimes proceed to the back of the surf, where they anchor on the outside of it, and wait for the country boats from the beach to convey their passengers on shore. When the weather is so unseasonable as to make it dangerous even for the country boats to pass and repass, a flag is displayed at the beach house to caution all persons on board ship against landing. Large ships generally moor in nine fathoms, with the flag staff W. N. W. about two miles from the shore. From the beginning of October until the end of December is considered the most dangerous season to remain in the Madras Roads.\n\nThe fishermen and lower classes of natives, employed on the water, use a species of floating machine, of a very simple construction, named a catamaran. These are formed of two or three light logs of wood, eight or ten feet in length, lashed together, with a small piece of wood inserted between them to serve as a stem-piece. When ready for the water they hold two men, who with their paddles launch themselves through the surf to fish, or to carry letters or small quantities of refreshments to ships, when no boats can venture out. They wear a pointed cap made of matting, where they secure the letters, which take no damage, however often the men are washed off the catamaran, which they regain by swimming, unless interrupted by a shark. Medals are given to such catamaran men as distinguish themselves by saving persons in danger, or by their care in conveying papers through the surf in dangerous weather.\n\nMadras differs in appearance con-\nsiderably from Calcutta, having no European town, except a few houses in the fort, the settlers residing entirely in their garden houses; repairing to the fort in the morning for the transaction of business, and returning in the afternoon. Fort George, as it now stands, was planned by the celebrated engineer, Mr. Robins, and is a strong handsome fortress, not too large. It is situated within a few yards of the sea, and although not so extensive, or of so regular a design as Fort William at Calcutta, yet from the greater facility of relieving it by sea, and the natural advantages of the ground, which leaves the enemy less choice in the manner of conducting his attack, it may on the whole be deemed equal to it, and has the convenience of requiring but a moderate garrison. In the middle of the present fortress stands the original fortress first erected here, but now mostly converted into government offices and the town residences of some of the civil servants. To the southward stands the church, at the back of which is the residence of the governor. To the northward of the old fort stands the Exchange, on which, in 1796, a lighthouse was erected; the light of which is 90 feet above the level of the sea, and may be seen from ships' decks 17 miles at sea.\n\nThe government house, which is large and handsome, is in the Choultry Plain, being situated on the edge of the esplanade; and near to it are Chepauk Gardens, the residence of the Nabob of the Carnatic, which intercept the breeze from the sea, and confine the view. The garden houses about Madras are generally only of one story, but of a pleasing style of architecture, having their porticoes and verandahs supported by chunamid pillars. The walls are of the same materials, either white or coloured, and the floors are covered with rattan mats. They are surrounded by a field planted with trees and shrubs, which have changed the barren sand of the plain into a rich scene of vegetation, but flowers and fruits are still raised with difficulty. During the hot winds mats made of the roots of the cusa grass, which has a pleasant smell, are placed against the doors and windows, and are constantly watered\u2014so that the air which blows through them spreads an agreeable freshness and fragrance throughout the room. The moment however the cooling influence of these mats is quitted, the sensation is like entering a furnace, although taking the average of the whole year Madras experiences less extreme heat than Calcutta. In January the lowest is about 70\u00b0, and in July the highest 91\u00b0.\n\nThe botanical garden, reared at a vast expense by the late Dr. James Anderson, is now in a sad state of ruin. On the 9th Dec. 1807, Madras was visited by a violent hurricane, which almost destroyed the garden, and the loss may be considered a national one. Many of the natives were involved in great misery by the storm, but it had a singular effect on one individual. After the hurricane had subsided a native woman raised a pile of wood in a gentleman's coach house, and getting underneath it with her child, had the desperate resolution to set fire to it, and thus burned herself and child to ashes. Among the remaining plants are still to be seen the sago tree, and the nopal, or prickly pear, on which the cochineal insect feeds, and which Dr. Anderson discovered to be an excellent antiscorbutic, and it has since been used as such on board of the ships of war on the Indian station. This plant (the nopal) keeps fresh, and even continues to vegetate, long after it is gathered, and it also makes an excellent pickle, which is used on board ship.\n\nThe Choultry Plain commences about a mile and a quarter S. W. of Fort George, from which it is separated by two small rivers. The one called the River Triplicane, winding from the west, gains the sea about 1000 yards to the south of the glacis;\nthe other coming from the N.W. possess the western side of the black town, the extremity of which is high ground, which the river rounds, and continues to the east within 100 yards of the sea, where it washes the foot of the glacis; and then turning to the south continues parallel with the beach, until it joins the mouth and bar of the River Triplicane. The Choultry Plain extends two miles to the westward of the enclosures which bound the St. Thom\u00e9 Road, and terminates on the other side at a large body of water called the Meliapoor tank, behind which runs with deep windings the Triplicane River. The road from the mount passes two miles and a half under the mound of the tank, and at its issue into the Choultry Plain is a kind of defile formed by the mound on one side, and buildings with brick enclosures on the other.\n\nIn the neighbourhood of Madras the soil, when well cultivated, produces a good crop of rice, provided in the wet season the usual quantity of rain falls. In some places the industry of the natives by irrigation creates a refreshing verdure. The fields yield two crops of rice per annum. In appearance the country is almost as level as Bengal, and in general exhibits a naked brown dusty plain with few villages, or any relief for the eye, except a range of abrupt detached hills towards the south. The roads in the immediate vicinity of Madras are excellent, and a great ornament, being broad and shaded by trees. The huts seen at a little distance from the town are covered with tiles, and have a better appearance than those of Bengal; and the inns and choultries, which are common on the roads, evince an attention to travellers not to be found in that province. A considerable part of the country, although at present naked, seems capable of raising trees and hedges, and shews symptoms of being in a progressive state of improvement. Near to Condaturm the country assumes a very pleasing aspect. Numerous small canals from the Sayembrumbacum tank convey a constant supply of water to most of the neighbouring fields, and fertilize them without the trouble of machinery; in consequence of which they yield two crops of rice per annum. The cattle in the neighbourhood of Madras are of the species which are common in the Deccan, and are a small breed, but larger than those reared in the southern parts of Bengal. In the vicinity of Madras buffaloes are generally used in carts, of a smaller size than the Bengal buffaloes.\n\nIn November, 1803, a navigable canal was opened from the black town to Ennore River, 10,560 yards in length; the greatest breadth at the top 40 feet, and its greatest depth 12 feet. By this channel boats go to Pulicat, from whence Madras is supplied with charcoal.\n\nThe society at Madras is more limited than at Calcutta, but the style of living much the same, except that provisions of all sorts are much less abundant, and greatly more expensive. During the cold season, there are monthly assemblies, with occasional balls all the year. Among the public places of resort is the mount road leading from the fort to St. Thomas's Mount, which is quite smooth, having banyan and yellow tulip trees planted on each side. Five miles from Fort George on this road stands a cenotaph, to the memory of the Marquis Cornwallis, the erection of which cost a very large sum. It is customary for the ladies and gentlemen of Madras to repair in their gayest equipages, during the cool of the evening, to the Mount Road; where they drive slowly about the cenotaph, and converse together.\n\nThe greatest lounge at this presidency is during visiting hours, from nine o'clock in the morning until eleven; during which interval, the young men go about from house to house, learn and retail the news, and offer their services to execute\ncommissions in the city, to which they must repair for purposes of business. When these functionaries are gone, a troop of idlers appears, and remain until dinner at two o'clock, when the real dinner is eaten. The party then separate, and many retire to rest or to read until five o'clock; about which time the master of the family returns from the fort, when an excursion to the Mount Road, and dinner afterwards, finishes the day, unless prolonged by a ball or supper party at night.\n\nAmong the charitable institutions at Madras are a male and female orphan asylum, both admirably conducted. The men servants are mostly Hindoos, but a great proportion of the female servants are native Portuguese. Besides French pedlars from Pondicherry, with boxes of lace and artificial flowers, there are a set of Mahomedans, who go about selling moco stones, petrified tamarind wood, garnets, coral, mock amber, and a variety of other trinkets.\n\nOn landing at Madras, passengers are immediately surrounded by hundreds of dobashies, and servants of all kinds pushing for employment. These dobashies undertake to interpret, buy all that is wanted, provide servants, tradesmen, palanquins, and to transact whatever business a stranger requires. These interpreters at Madras are of three castes of Sudras. The persons of the first caste seem analogous to the Kyastas (or Koits) of Bengal, and are called Canaca-pillays, which by the English is commonly written Canacopily, or Canacoply; and this name is by Europeans extended to all persons, whether Brahmins or Sudras, who follow the same profession. The next caste, who follow the business of debashies, are the more learned Coaas or Yadavas; and the third caste are the Vayalors of the labouring class. Each of these castes pretends to a superiority of rank over the others. The pride of caste is remarkably prevalent among the Hindoos, and there is scarcely a creature so wretched or ignorant, but who, on this account, holds in the utmost contempt many persons in easy circumstances and respectable situations. The rank of the different inferior castes is by no means well ascertained\u2014there being only one point perfectly clear, which is, the immeasurable superiority of the Brahmins above all the rest of mankind.\n\nThe Madras jugglers are celebrated all over India for their dexterity; the most curious, and at the same time most disgusting sight is the swallowing of a sword, in which there is no deception. They commence operations very young\u2014the children beginning the experiment with short bits of bamboo, which are lengthened as the throat and stomach are able to bear them.\n\nThe black town of Madras stands to the northward of the fort, from which it is separated by a spacious esplanade. It was formerly surrounded by fortifications, sufficient to resist the incursions of cavalry; but having long become unnecessary, are now much neglected. In this town reside the native Armenian and Portuguese merchants, and also many Europeans unconnected with government. Like other native towns it is irregular and confused, being a mixture of brick and bamboo houses, and makes a better appearance at a distance than when closely inspected. In 1794 the total population of both towns was estimated at 300,000 persons, and the city certainly has not since diminished in any respect.\n\nOwing to the want of a secure port and navigable rivers, the commerce of Madras is much inferior to that of the other two presidencies; but all sorts of Asiatic and European commodities are, however, to be procured. Besides the disadvantages abovementioned, the Carnatic province considered generally is sterile compared with Bengal; and raises none of the staple ars.\nties of that province, in such quantities, or at so low a price, as to admit of a competition in foreign markets. The details of the external commerce for the year 1841, which was on the whole an unfavourable year, will be found at the conclusion of this article. The East India Company's staple article of export is piece goods. Meat, poultry, and fish, and other refreshments for shipping are to be procured here, but they are neither of so good a quality nor so cheap as in Bengal. Wood and fuel is rather scarce, and consequently dear. The water is of a very good quality, and supplied by the native boats at specified prices. On account of the dearness of provisions wages are considerably higher here than in Calcutta, but few servants are kept comparatively, yet the work is quite as well done. Household servants receive from two to five pagodas per month, and the hire of a palankeen is four and a half pagodas per month; for the field service a set of bearers receive each two pagodas per month, but at the presidency one and three-fourth pagodas each.\n\nThe accounts at Madras are kept in star pagodas, fanams, and cash; 80 cash make one fanam. The bank of European merchants keep their accounts at 12 fanams to a rupee, and 42 fanams to a star pagoda; but the natives keep theirs at 12 fanams 60 cash to a rupee, and 44 fanams 50 cash to a pagoda. In the market the pagoda fluctuates from 44 to 46 fanams. The current coins are various sorts of pagodas, Arcot rupees, single and double fanams, and copper coins, of 20, 10, 5, and one cash each. For the adjustment of the customs here, the pound sterling is valued at two pagodas 21 fanams; the Spanish dollar at 28 fanams 40 cash; the China tael one pagoda; three and one-fourth seica rupees one pagoda; and three and a half Bombay rupees one pagoda. In the Company's accounts, the 109 star pagodas are valued at 425 current rupees. The origin of the term pagoda has never been satisfactorily ascertained. By the English, in the Carnatic, it is a name given to a Hindoo temple; and also to a gold coin called varaha, or varahum, by the Hindoos, and hoon by the Mahommedans.\n\nA supreme court of justice is established at Madras on the model of that of Fort William, in Bengal. It consists of a chief justice and three other judges, who are barristers of not less than five years' standing, appointed by the king. The salary of the chief justice is 6000l. per annum, and of the puisne judges 5000l. each, to be paid at the exchange of 8s. per pagoda. After seven years' service in India, if the judges of the supreme court return to Europe, the king is authorized to order pensions to be paid them out of the territorial revenues on the following proportions: to the chief judge not more than 1600l. per annum, and to the junior judges not more than 1200l. per annum. The law practitioners attached to the court are seven attorneys and four barristers.\n\nThis part of the Coast of Coromandel was probably visited at an earlier period by the English, but they possessed no fixed establishment until A.D. 1639, in which year, on the 1st of March, a grant was received from the descendant of the Hindoo dynasty of Bijanagur, then reigning at Chandergherry, for the erection of a fort. This document from Sree Rung Raycel expressly enjoins, that the town and fort to be erected at Madras shall be called after his own name, Sree Runga Rayapataam; but the local governor, or naik, Damerla Venkatadri, who first invited Mr. Francis Day, the Chief of Armagon, to remove to Madras, had previously intimated to him, that he would have the new English establishment founded in the name of his father, Chenappa, and the name of Chenappatam continues to be universally ap-\nplied to the town of Madras by the natives of that division of the south of India, named Dravida. In consequence of this permission, without waiting for instructions from the Court of Directors, Mr. Day proceeded, with great alacrity, to the construction of a fortress, which in India is soon surrounded by a town. The latter he allowed to retain its Indian appellation, but the former he named Fort St. George. The territory granted extended five miles along shore, and one mile inland.\n\nIn 1644 the money expended on the fortifications amounted to \u00a3294l., and it was computed that \u00a3200l. more would be requisite to render this station impregnable to the native powers, and a garrison of 100 soldiers. The latter appears afterwards to have been much diminished, as in 1652 there were only 26 soldiers in the fortress. In 1653 the agent and council of Madras were raised to the rank of a presidency. In 1654 the Court of Directors ordered the president and council at Fort George to reduce their civil establishment to two factors, and a guard of 10 soldiers.\n\nIn 1661 Sir Edward Winter was appointed agent at Madras; but, in 1665, was superseded, and Mr. George Foxcroft appointed to succeed him. On the arrival of the latter, Sir Edward Winter seized and imprisoned him, and kept possession of Fort George until the 22d of August, 1668, when he delivered it up to commissioners from England, on condition of receiving a full pardon for all offences. Mr. Foxcroft then assumed the government, which he filled until 1671, when he embarked for Europe, and was succeeded by Sir William Langhorne. This year the sovereign of the Carnatic made over to the Company his moiety of the customs at Madras for a fixed rent of 1200 pagodas per annum. In 1676 the pay of a European soldier at Madras was 21s. per month, in full for provisions and necessaries of every kind.\n\nIn 1680 Mr. William Gifford was appointed Governor of Fort George, and in 1683 he was appointed president both of Madras and Bengal; in 1686 he was dismissed, and Mr. Yule appointed president of Fort George only. On the 12th of December, 1687, the population of the city of Madras, Fort George, and the villages within the Company's bounds, was reported in the public letter to be 300,000 persons. In 1691 Mr. Yule was dismissed, and Mr. Higginson appointed his successor.\n\nIn 1696 Mr. Thomas Pitt was appointed governor, in which year the revenue produced by taxes at Madras amounted to 40,000 pagodas. In 1701 Mr. President Pitt expresses his fears that the natives will bribe the Arab fleet to assist them in blockading the garrison. In 1702 Madras was blockaded by Daoud Khan, Aurangzebe's general, who said he had orders to demolish it altogether. Up to 1703 gunpowder formed one of the articles of the outward-bound investment, but about this period the manufacture of it was so much improved at Madras, as to preclude the necessity of sending any more. In 1708 the governor, Mr. President Pitt, was much embarrassed by a dispute among the natives for precedence\u2014one party described as the right-hand caste, and the other as the left-hand caste; each threatening to leave the place, and retire to St. Thome's, if superiority were not granted.\n\nFrom the junction of the rival East India Companies, in 1708, we have no authentic annals of Madras until 1744, when it was besieged by the French from the Mauritius, under M. de la Bourdonnais; at which period it was estimated, that the native inhabitants residing within the Company's boundaries amounted to 250,000 persons. The English in the colony did not exceed 300 men, and of these 200 only were soldiers of the garrison. On the 7th of September the French began to bom-\nhard the town, and on the 10th it was surrendered. There was not a man killed in the French camp during the siege; four or five Englishmen were killed in the town by the explosion of the bombs, which likewise destroyed two or three houses. From this period it is useful to contemplate the progress made by the British in Hindostan, both in the science and spirit of war. The plunder realized by the French was about 200,000l. and the town was, by the capitulation, ransomed for 440,000l., which agreement was subsequently broken by M. Dupleix, and all the British inhabitants, of every description, compelled to abandon the place.\n\nAt the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle Madras was restored, and evacuated by the French in August, 1749, when it was found in a very improved condition. The buildings within the white town had suffered no alteration; but the bastions and batteries in this quarter had been enlarged and strengthened. The French had entirely demolished that part of the black town situated within 300 yards of the white, in which space had stood the buildings belonging to the most opulent American and Indian merchants. With the ruins they formed an excellent glacis, which covered the north side of the white town, and they likewise had thrown up another on the south side. The defences of the town remained still much inferior to those of Fort St. David, where the East India Company ordered the presidency to continue.\n\nAlthough improved, Fort George was incapable of making a considerable resistance against a regular European force; yet in this condition it was allowed to remain until 1756, when the apprehension of another attack from the French compelled the governor and council to strengthen the fortifications. About 4000 labourers, of different descriptions, were consequently employed, and continued at work until driven away by the approach of the French, under M. Lally, in 1758.\n\nOn the 12th of December, that year, the last of the troops from the different outposts entered the fort, and completed the force with which Madras was to sustain the siege. The whole of the European military, including officers, with 64 topasses, and 89 coffres, amounted to 1758 men; the sepoys, 2200 men; the European inhabitants, not military, were 150, and they were appropriated, without distinction, to serve out stores and provisions to the garrison. The council of the presidency, by an unanimous vote, committed the defence of the siege to the governor, Mr. Pigot, recommending him to consult Colonel Lawrence on all occasions.\n\nThe siege commenced on the 17th of December, 1758, and was prosecuted with the utmost skill, vigour, and bravery on both sides, until the 17th of February, when the French were obliged to raise the siege with such precipitation, that they had not time to destroy the black town, or remove their sick. They took with them the quarter part of the stores, but left behind them 52 pieces of cannon, and 150 barrels of gunpowder.\n\nDuring the siege the fort fired 26,554 rounds from their cannon, 7502 shells from their mortars, and threw 1900 hand grenades; the musketry expended 200,000 cartridges. In these services were used 1768 barrels of gunpowder; 30 pieces of cannon and five mortars had been dismounted from the works. As many of the enemy's cannon balls were gathered in the works, or about the defences of the fort, or found within the black town, as the garrison had expended. The enemy threw 8000 shells of all sorts; of which, by far the greater number were directed against the buildings, so that scarce a house remained that was not open to the heavens.\n\nWhile the siege lasted 13 officers were killed, two died, 14 wounded,\nand four taken prisoners; in all 33. Of European troops 198 were killed, 52 died in the hospitals, 20 deserted, 122 were taken prisoners, and 167 wounded; in all 579. Of the sepoys and lascars 114 were killed, including officers, 232 wounded, and 440 deserted.\n\nThe loss of men sustained by the French army has never been exactly ascertained. Their force at the commencement of the siege was 3500 Europeans, 2000 sepoys, and 2000 native and European cavalry.\n\nSince that memorable period Madras has suffered from no external attacks, although approached very near by Hyder in 1767 and 1781; but the strength of the works is wholly beyond the utmost effort of native tactics, and blockade need not be apprehended while the sea is open. From being the head of a petty territory, five miles long by one broad, it is now the capital of an extensive region, comprehending the whole of the south of India and part of the Deccan, some account of which will be found in the next article, under the head of Madras Presidency. The last governor was Sir George Hilario Barlow, who landed the 24th of December, 1808, and returned to Europe in 1814. He was succeeded as governor by the Honourable Hugh Elliot, who still continues to fill that important station.\n\n**Commercial Details of the Private Trade, from the 1st of January, 1811, to the 30th of April, 1812 (16 Months).**\n\n**AMERICA.**\n\nThe total value of imports from America, from the 1st of January, 1811, to the 30th of April, 1812, was Arcot rupees 1,04,017, which consisted principally of the inferior sorts of wine, gin, brandy, and provisions of different sorts\u2014such as hams, tongues, &c.\n\nThe exports to America amounted to 374,579 Arcot rupees, consisting of the produce and manufactures of the districts under the Madras Presidency. American ships rarely take their whole cargoes from the Coast of Coromandel, but, having proceeded to Calcutta, and received the most valuable part, call afterwards at Madras for such piece goods as are required for their market. They land their specie at Calcutta, and draw bills from Madras for the goods they find expedient to ship there\u2014thus exhibiting large shipments, compared with their imports at Madras. At this particular period the political state of affairs had nearly put a stop to all intercourse between America and the British settlements in India.\n\n**BATAVIA.**\n\nThe total value of imports to Madras from Batavia, between the 1st of January, 1811, and 30th of April, 1812, was 48,356 Arcot rupees, which consisted principally of prize sugar, sent by the agents of the captors, with a little sugar candy and tutenague.\n\nIn the same period the exports to Batavia amounted to 259,576 Arcot rupees, composed chiefly of piece goods\u2014many being of the coarse coloured sort, with salamores received from the southern districts; some handkerchiefs of the manufacture of Madras and Ventapollam, and a considerable proportion of southern blue cloths. There was a re-export of goods to the amount of 51,555 rupees, chiefly of wines and other European articles for the consumption of the Europeans of Java.\n\n**BENGAL.**\n\nThe total value of imports from Bengal, from the 1st of January, 1811, to the 30th of April, 1812, amounted to 3,004,180 Arcot rupees. The articles composing this extensive import are seldom found materially to alter, the great staples being different species of grain, particularly rice, which that fertile province exports in large quantities. There is also a great demand for Bengal raw silk, which is manufac-\ntured in the interior into piece goods, mostly for the use of the natives, but which species of manufacture has of late much improved. Another principal article received from Bengal is the canvas, which is there manufactured, of an excellent quality, and much used by his majesty's ships, which have also of late been supplied from Bengal with salt provisions. The other imports are piece goods, muslins, and shawls of a coarse description, silk piece goods of an inferior kind, long pepper, sugar, borax, saltpetre, some wines, precious stones, and numerous small articles.\n\nThe exports to Bengal, during the same period, amounted to only 130,507 Arcot rupees, and consisted chiefly of some red wood, coloured piece goods, and salt. The principal returns made for the extensive imports are in bills, private and public; those granted by government being usually at the exchange of 350 Arcot rupees per 100 pagodas. The re-exports from Madras to Bengal are generally considerable.\n\nBOMBAY AND BUMPOORAH.\n\nThe total imports from Bombay, from the 1st of January, 1811, to the 30th of April, 1812, amounted to 162,861 Arcot rupees. The imports from Bombay are, with very little exception, first received there, on their trade with the Persian and Arabian Gulphs, and principally consist of dried fruits or drugs; viz. almonds, dates, raisins, kismishes, rose-water, ackara karum, &c. The imports from Bussorah are nearly of the same description, being dried fruits, hing, mandesty, brimstone, &c. and also some horses. The other imports from Bombay, with the exception of some cotton, consist generally of goods, first received there from Bengal and China.\n\nThe exports to Bombay, during the same period, amounted to only 30,569 Arcot rupees, and consisted principally of some chintz and coloured turbans, manufactured about Masulipatam, with a small proportion of long cloth.\n\nThe intercourse between Madras and the Brazils is inconsiderable. The Portuguese vessels usually proceed to Bengal, where fine silk and piece goods, calculated for their markets, are procurable on more reasonable terms than at Madras.\n\nCEYLON.\n\nThe total value of the imports from Ceylon, from the 1st of January, 1811, to the 30th of April, 1812, amounted to 743,859 Arcot rupees, and consisted of large supplies of arrack, principally for the use of the navy, and the European troops on the coast. In addition to this, Ceylon also furnishes a number of articles, which are afterwards re-exported to China; such as biche de mer, shark fins, ebony, chayroot, palmeras, and recpers. The pearls procured at Ceylon do not often appear in the Madras import accounts, as they are generally conveyed to the opposite shore, and brought to Madras over land.\n\nThe exports to Ceylon are very insignificant, being principally European and China articles, re-exported for the consumption of the Europeans on that island; and, from the 1st of January, 1811, to the 30th of April, 1812, amounted to only 18,055 Arcot rupees. Ceylon requires considerable supplies of grain; but much of it is furnished from Bengal, and paid for by government bills.\n\nCHINA.\n\nThe total value of the imports from China, from the 1st of January, 1811, to the 30th of April, 1812, amounted to 1,336,948 Arcot rupees, which consisted of the usual description of China goods; such as tea, sugar, nankin, China ware, with a large proportion of allum, camphor, arsenic, tutenague, China root, galengal, piece goods, stationery, &c.\n\nThe exports to China, during the same period, amounted to only 440,760 Arcot rupees, which was\npartly owing to the failure of the cotton crop in the southern districts, that article being held in higher estimation in the China market than any other which is sent there. The total amount of cotton exported within this period was 13,761 cwt. valued at 288,854 rupees; besides which, there was a large portion of the produce of Ceylon exported, consisting of biche de mar, shark fins, and ebony. The re-exports to China amounted to 341,432 rupees; viz. pearls, 288,876 rupees; ebony and other articles made up the difference.\n\nLONDON.\n\nThe total value of imports from London, from the 10th of January, 1811, to the 30th of April, 1812, amounted to 1,767,204 Arcot rupees. The various articles comprising it consist of the supplies brought in the investments of captains and officers of the Company's ships, and comprehend not merely goods of consumption found on sale in Europe shops, but also the different articles in demand for the manufactures, &c., iron, copper, tin, and naval stores, with supplies of wine and accessories for individuals. Coral was formerly imported in large quantities, but it is now much reduced.\n\nDuring the above period, the exports to London amounted to 979,600 Arcot rupees, and consisted of indigo, valued at 418,967\u2014piece goods, 307,944, which formed the chief articles; besides some rough diamonds, one of which was valued at 16,000 star pagodas (6,400l). The re-exports were prize spices; such as mace, cloves, nutmegs; pearls, to the value of 97,384 rupees; and pepper, 51,333 sicca rupees. The quantity of indigo, manufactured and exported from this coast, increases annually.\n\nFrom Madeira, wine to the value of 69,578 Arcot rupees was imported.\n\nFrom the Malabar coast the import was very small, consisting of pepper, timber cow, cordage, and coir, with some other small articles; the whole amounting to only 11,410 Arcot rupees. The exports and re-exports were too small for notice.\n\nMANILLA.\n\nThe total value of the imports from Manilla, from the 1st of January, 1811, to the 30th of April, 1812, amounted to 225,964 Arcot rupees; consisting chiefly of soft sugar and indigo, besides treasure to a considerable amount. The indigo is of a good quality, and usually re-exported for the European or American market. As a trade is carried on between Manilla and China, a part of the returns find their way to Canton, and are from thence remitted to some of the presidencies in bills, specie, or goods.\n\nThe exports to Manilla, during the same period, amounted to 572,483 Arcot rupees, and consisted of various descriptions of piece goods; viz. camhays, handkerchiefs, punjum cloths, &c. to the amount of 497,211 sicca rupees; and cotton, 32,643 sicca rupees; which last was probably ultimately intended for the China market, and the other articles for Spanish America. This trade has greatly declined since the internal warfare in the mother country and colonies. The vessels sailing for Manilla usually leave Madras in the month of July, and those with returns mostly arrive in the January and February following.\n\nISLES OF FRANCE.\n\nThe total value of the imports from the Isles of France, from the 1st of January, 1811, to the 30th of April, 1812, amounted to 202,096 Arcot rupees, which consisted of coffee and cloves, &c. 162,697 sicca rupees; besides which there was brandy, copper, iron, lead, and many other small articles, which probably had formerly been captured by the enemy. The great proportion of returns for goods exported to the Isles of France must consequently be made by bills.\n\nThe exports, during the above pe-\nperiod, amounted to 1,157,646 Arcot rupees, and consisted principally of long cloths, blue cloths, and handkerchiefs, muslins, ginghams, punjum cloths, salampores, and shirts; with a small re-export, composed of Europe and China goods\u2014such as wines, hosiery, tea, nankin, and also some arrack. The piece goods, of a coarse description, and particularly the blue cloths, were intended for clothing the slaves, and for re-export to the small African Islands, and ports in the Mozambique Channel. The value of the piece goods exported exceeded 10\u00bd lacs of rupees; the other principal article was soap, to the amount of 20,315 sicca rupees.\n\nPEGUE AND THE BIRMAN EMPIRE.\n\nThe total value of the imports from Pegue, from the 1st of January, 1811, to the 30th of April, 1812, amounted to 495,643 Arcot rupees. The staple article of import from Pegue is timber; but, owing to the troubled state of that country, the price, during this period, was extravagant, and it could not be obtained in large quantities. The breed of Birman horses are in estimation at Madras, and are imported to a considerable value. The other imports are a coarse description of cardamoms, ivory, wax, wood, oil, coir cordage, with some other small articles.\n\nThe exports, during the above period, amounted to 215,006 Arcot rupees; of which seven-eighths consisted of piece goods\u2014such as coarse handkerchiefs, manufactured at Venapollam, in the vicinity of Madras, with some of the medium sort of Arnee muslins. The re-exports were small, and consisted of copper, arrack, brandy, mace, cloves, iron, perfumery, glass ware, and naval stores.\n\nThe trade is now inconsiderable, compared with what it was some years ago. Few vessels, commanded by Europeans, are now engaged in it, and these are of a very small description. Most of the traders from Madras to Pegue are under native commanders, who sail them at a small expense; but, being from parsimony ill found, and frequently in a bad state of repair, there are many of them lost.\n\nIn 1811-12 the total amount of the exports, exclusive of treasure from Madras, and the ports under the Madras Presidency, in private trade, amounted to 12,869,049 (Arcot Rupees) Ditto ditto of imports 12,039,679\n\nBalance in favour of the export trade 829,370\n\nThe whole quantity of treasure imported into Madras, between the 1st of January, 1811, and the 30th of April, 1812, amounted to 2,662,438 (Arcot rupees) Imported at the subordinate ports 1,513,591\n\nArcot rupees 4,176,029\n\nTreasure exported during the above period.\u2014From Madras 311,857 From the subordinate ports 6,720\n\nArcot rupees 318,577\n\nIn the official year, 1811-12, the value of the investment exported by the East India Company was as follows, viz.\n\nTO LONDON.\nCochineal - - 12,454\nHemp - - 2,272\nPiece goods - - 4,416,163\nSaltpetre - - 22,545\nSugar - - 10,227\n\n4,463,661\n\nTO ST. HELENA.\nCholum seeds - - 40\nPiece goods - - 6,752\n\n6,792\n\nTO THE ISLES OF FRANCE.\nPiece goods - - 18,829\n\nArcot rupees 4,489,282\nMADRAS PRESIDENCY.\n\nThe territories subject to the Presidency of Fort George, or Madras, comprehend nearly the whole of India south of the Krishna River (improperly named the Peninsula), and also a large province in the Deccan, named the Northern Circars. Within these boundaries are three princes, who collect the revenues, and exercise a certain degree of power in the internal management of their respective states; but, with reference to external politics, are wholly subordinate to the British government, are protected by a subsidiary force, and furnish large annual contributions. These princes are the Rajahs of Mysore, Travancor, and Cochin; the rest of the country is under the immediate jurisdiction of the governor and council at Madras; and, for the administration of justice, and collection of the revenue, has been subdivided into the following districts, viz.\n\nNORTHERN CIRCARS.\n1. Ganjam.\n2. Vizagapatam.\n3. Rajamundry.\n4. Masulipatam.\n5. Guntur, including Palnaud, which is part of the Carnatic.\n\nCARNATIC.\n6. Nellore and Ongole, including part of the Western Pollams or Zemindaries.\n7. Northern division of Arcot, including Sativaid, Pulicat, Coongoody in the Barramahal, part of Ballaghaut, and of the Western Pollams or Zemindaries.\n8. Chingleput, or the Jaghre.\n9. Southern division of Arcot, including Cuddalore and Pondicherry.\n10. Trichinopoly.\n11. Tanjore.\n\nMYSORE AND CARNATIC\n12. Dindigul, including Madura, Manapara Pollams, Ramanad, and Shevagunga, forming part of the Southern Carnatic.\n\nSOUTHERN CARNATIC.\n13. Tinnevelly.\n\nMYSORE.\n14. Bellary. { Balaghaut Ceded\n15. Cudapah. } Districts.\n16. Seringapatam.\n17. Salem and Kistnaggherry.\n18. Coimbetoor.\n19. Canara.\n20. Malabar.\n21. Madras.\n\nThe limits of these districts are, almost in every instance, co-extensive with the local jurisdiction of the Zillah courts of justice; and the aggregate square contents of the whole may be roughly estimated at 125,000 geographical square miles.\n\nThe provinces subject to the government of Fort George, with the exception of Canara, Malabar, and other districts, in which traces of private property still existed when they came under the British government, exhibited nearly the same system of landed property and revenue policy. The land was the property of government, and of the ryots or cultivators; but where the share of government absorbed nearly the whole of the landlord's rent, the ryots possessed little more interest in the soil than that of hereditary tenancy.\n\nThe country was divided into villages. A village (in this part of India), geographically, is a tract of country, comprising some hundreds or thousands of acres of arable and waste land; politically, a village is a little republic or corporation, having within itself its municipal officers and corporate artificers. Its boundaries are seldom altered, and, though sometimes injured, and even desolated by war, famine, and epidemic distempers, the same name, boundaries, interests, and even families, continue for ages.\nThe government share was generally received from rice lands in kind, at rates varying from 40 to 60 per cent. of the gross produce, after deducting certain portions distributed before the threshing commences. The share of government from dry grain land was generally received in cash, varying with the produce.\n\nThe following statement will show in what parts of the country the permanent settlement of the land revenue has been carried into effect, and at what periods it has been extended in particular districts:\n\n**ANCIENT TERRITORY.**\n\n*Districts. When permanently assessed.*\n\n- The Jaghire - - 1801-2.\n- Northern Circars 1802-3 & 1804-5.\n\n**MODERN TERRITORY.**\n\n- Salem - - -\n- Western Pollams { 1802-3.\n- Chittore Pollams\n- Southern Pollams\n- Ramnad - - - 1803-4.\n- Kistnagerry - - 1804-5.\n- Dindigul - - - 1804-5.\n\n**ANCIENT TERRITORY.**\n\n- Trivendaporam { 1806-7.\n- Jaghire villages\n\n**Country not permanently assessed.**\n\n**MODERN TERRITORY.**\n\n- Malabar.\n- Canara.\n- Coimbetoor.\n- Balaghat Cceded Districts.\n- Tanjore.\n\n**CARNATIC.**\n\n- Palnaud.\n- Nellore and Ongole.\n- Arcot, northern and southern division.\n- Sativaid.\n- Trichinopoly.\n- Madura.\n- Tinnevelly Circar Lands.\n\nThe total population of these provinces has been estimated at 12 millions; and, from the long tranquility and comparatively plenty they have enjoyed, is certainly increasing annually. In this estimate the inhabitants of the territories subject to the rajahs of Mysore, Travancor, and Cochin, are not included.\n\nBesides the land revenue, the other sources from whence the public receipts of the Madras government are drawn, consist of the government customs both by sea and land; the latter being levied on the articles of the inland trade, on their transit through the country, and on their entrance into particular towns; of a monopoly of the sale and manufacture of salt; of the licensed manufacture and sale of toddy and arrack; and, in some parts of the country, of the licensed sale of betel and tobacco, and of stamp duties and fees on judicial proceedings. The mode and principles, according to which these branches of the public resources are conducted, are similar to those which obtain under the Bengal government. The collectors, to whom is confided, under the superintendence of the Presidency, the local management of the revenues, are 21 in number, exclusive of assistant collectorships.\n\nThe following are the particulars of the revenues and charges of the Madras Presidency, from all sources, for the year 1808-9:\n\n| REVENUES | \u00a3 |\n|----------|---|\n| Post Office | 16,808 |\n| Customs | 152,938 |\n| Carnatic | 1,016,679 |\n| Tanjore | 431,405 |\n| Mysore | 1,540,228 |\n| Nizam | 681,807 |\n| Dutch Settlements | 2,727 |\n| Travancore | 6,504 |\n| Land | 1,057,628 |\n| Farms and Licences | 61,599 |\n\n\u00a34,968,321\n\n| CHARGES | \u00a3 |\n|---------|---|\n| Post Office | 19,926 |\n| Revenues and Customs | 333,024 |\n| Carnatic | 333,613 |\n| Tanjore | 130,685 |\n| Mysore | 208,519 |\n| Nizam | 77,551 |\n\nCarried forward \u00a31,103,318\nBrought forward \u00a31,103,318\nDutch Settlements - - 9,336\nCivil and judicial - - 493,548\nMilitary - - - - 3,143,575\nBuildings & fortifications 185,966\n\n\u00a34,935,743\n\nTotal of charges \u00a34,935,743\nInterest on debt 495,408\n\n5,431,151\n\nRevenue - - - 4,968,321\n\nDeficiency \u00a3462,830 in 1809\n\nIn 1809 the debt owing by the East India Company at this presidency amounted to \u00a37,059,679\n\nAmount of assets, debts, &c. belonging to the East India Company at the same period \u00a39,183,682\n\n\u00a32,124,003\n\nThe Company are possessed of property to a considerable amount, which, from not being considered as immediately available, is not inserted among the assets. This property consists of plate, household furniture, guns on the ramparts, arms, and military stores; to which might be added the buildings.\n\nIn 1810 the sum, estimated to have been expended on buildings and fortifications, was \u00a31,840,682\n\nPlate, furniture, plantations, farms, vessels, stores, &c. 447,798\n\n\u00a32,288,480\n\nIn 1811; the number of civil servants on the Madras establishment was 206; and the pay, allowances, and emoluments of the civil service, including the European uncovenanted assistants, amounted to 470,346l. per annum.\n\nIn 1811, the number of regular troops of all descriptions serving under the Madras Presidency amounted to 50,456 men. The pay and allowances to the officers belonging to the Madras establishment, 1347 in number, was 554,481l. The chaplains on the Madras establishment were 15, their allowances and pay 14,300l. per annum. The surgeons 101, their pay and allowances 57,890l. per annum.\n\nSince the completion of the arrangements for the government of the extensive territories subject to this presidency, one circumstance has peculiarly contributed to improve the condition of the great body of the natives; which is, the vigour and efficiency of the administration, neither permitting nor acknowledging divided rights of sovereignty, but keeping every other power in due subordination. The beneficial operation of this state of things has been greatly felt in Bengal, but much more on the Coast of Coromandel, arising from the greater degree in which a turbulent and warlike spirit pervaded the zemindars, the polygars, and other chiefs. While they maintained their military retainers and establishments, they not only bid defiance to government, but were constantly carrying on petty wars against each other; by which the fields of the cultivator were overrun and laid waste, his crops destroyed, and whatever other property he possessed, fell a sacrifice to the predatory bands of the contending parties.\n\nAt present there exists not, unless in the hills of the Northern Circars, and in a very few other places, any military force kept up by individuals. The unruly and restless spirit of the polygars is gradually giving way to the peaceable habits of the landholder, and the peasant is enabled to pursue the cultivation of his fields without danger or apprehension. The evils, which were formerly continual, are now only occasionally experienced, and promptly and efficaciously suppressed by a vigorous government, whose duty it is to ensure equal protection to all ranks of its subjects. (5th Report, Milburn, R. Grant, &c.)\n\nMADURA, (Mathura).\u2014A district\nin the Southern Carnatic, situated principally between the 9th and 10th degrees of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by the Polygar territory and Dindigul; to the south by Tinevelly; on the east it has the district of Marawas; and on the west that of Dindigul. The Vaygaroo and Candaroo are the chief rivers, and the principal towns Madura and Scholavanden.\n\nThe ancient sovereigns of this country were named the Pandian race; and it is supposed to have been the Pandionis Mediterraneae, and Madura Regia Pandionis of Ptolemy. In conjunction with Trichinopoly it forms a Hindoo geographical division, named Madru.\n\nAlthough the soil is naturally fertile, and tolerably well supplied with water, this district never attained the perfection of cultivation to be found in Tanjore and some other of the Company's districts, which probably was owing to the number of independent polygars in a state of constant hostility; by which it was occupied, until transferred to the British, in 1801, by the Nabob of Arcot. During the early Carnatic wars, from 1740 to 1760, a great proportion of this territory was covered with forests and thick jungle, in the recesses of which the polygars had their fortified castles. By the recent arrangements, it is comprehended in the Dindigul collectorship, and having enjoyed long tranquillity is rapidly recovering.\n\nIn the remote periods of Hindoo history this was one of the holy countries of the south of India, the capital being styled the Southern Mathura; and the district still exhibits the remains of many monuments of former Hindoo grandeur. In modern times the Christian religion has made no inconsiderable progress; the number of Roman Catholic Christians, in 1785, having been estimated at 18,000, besides those of the Protestant persuasion. (Wilks, Fullarton, Fra Paolo, Mackenzie, 5th Report, &c.)\n\nMadura.\u2014An ancient city in the Southern Carnatic, the capital of the district of Madura. Lat. 9\u00b0. 51'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 13'. E.\n\nThe four sides of Madura front nearly the four cardinal points. The river passing from the N. W. washes the walls at the N. E. angle; and the bed, unless immediately after heavy rains, lies in dry flats of sand, on some of which are buildings with narrow channels between them. This town, during the Carnatic wars, from 1740 to 1760, sustained many sieges, and was often in the hands of refractory polygars, with which description of chiefs the district then swarmed. The great revolution which, towards the conclusion of the last century, transferred the south of India into the possession of the British, by removing hostile operations to a great distance, has rendered the maintenance of this and a multitude of other fortresses wholly superfluous.\n\nTravelling distance from Seringapatam, 240; from Madras, 307 miles. (Orme, Renouf, &c.)\n\nMadura, (Mathura).\u2014An island in the Eastern Seas, situated off the north-east coast of the Island of Java, from which it is separated by a narrow strait. In length it may be estimated at 100 miles, by 16 the average breadth. The channel of the Straits of Madura where it narrows is only 83 fathoms wide, and marked with buoys; although at the entrance there are only three fathoms water, ships of a large size can pass it, the bottom being soft mud, which is easily worked through in the lightest breeze, assisted by the strength of the currents. In 1775 this island was divided into three divisions, which contained 30,000 tjadgars, or families. At that period a Dutch junior merchant resided on the island, at Samanap, the capital, principally for the purpose of watching the island and its inhabitants, as the commerce carried on was very trifling.\n\nThe language spoken by the inhabitants of Madura appears to be a\ndialect of the Javanese. The greater part of the natives profess the religion of their ancestors, resemble the Hindoos in their looks, wear the Hindu mark on their forehead, and the women burn themselves with their husbands, according to the practice of the Hindoos. Like the unconverted Javanese, they are particularly addicted to the worship of Indra, Surya, and Vishnu. The word Dewa, used in some parts of Sumatra to express a superior and invisible class of beings, is an original word in Madura for a superior being, which the Javanese believed in; but with regard to whom they used no ceremonies or forms of worship. They appear to have some idea of a future life, but not as a state of retribution; conceiving immortality to be the lot of rich, rather than of good men.\n\nThe inhabitants of the interior and mountainous parts of this island have a considerable knowledge of vegetable poisons, in which they dip their arrows for the purposes of warfare and the chase. These arrows are made of thin slips of bamboo, and are blown through a hollow tube. (Marsden, Leyden, Stavorinus, Tembe, &c.)\n\nMaggeri, (Magadi).\u2014A town in the Mysore Rajah's territories, 47 miles N. E. from Seingapatan. Lat. 12\u00b0 57'. Long. 77\u00b0 37'. E.\n\nFrom Ramagiri to this place the road is through a wild but romantic country, which consists of low hills, intermixed with little cultivated valleys, the soil of which is tolerably good; but they are mostly cultivated with dry grains only. The higher parts are covered with trees, which, owing to the poverty of the soil, are in most parts very small; but near Sevendroog the timber and bamboos grow to a good size. The summits of all the ridges of hills are bare rocks of the granitic porphyry, and often rise into high sharp peaks, or immense masses of naked stone. The most stupendous of these is occupied by Sevendroog, which the army of Lord Cornwallis took by assault.\n\nIn the hilly tract of country there are many iron forges, the metal being procured partly from the black sand, which is found in the rainy season in the channels of all the torrents in the country, and partly from an ore which is found at Gleetipur in great abundance. During the four months of heavy rains, four men are able to collect as much sand as a furnace can smelt for the remainder of the year. Steel is also manufactured here.\n\nIn the woods around Maggeri and Sevendroog the sandal wood of the English merchants is found. When the tree is cut, the common size of it at the root is nine inches diameter; but only one-third of the tree is valuable, the remainder being white wood, and totally devoid of smell. The wood is found to be of the best quality in trees that have grown on a steep rocky soil. The bottom of the stem under the ground, immediately above the division into roots, is the most valuable part of the tree. There are also a few teak trees in this neighbourhood, but in general this valuable timber does not grow of a sufficient size for use. (F. Buchanan, &c. &c.)\n\nMAGINDANAO, (Melindenow).\n\nA large island in the Eastern Seas, the most southerly of the Philippines, and situated principally between the 6th and 10th degrees of north latitude. The shape is extremely irregular, but in length it may be estimated at 300 miles, by 105 the average breadth.\n\nThis island has three remarkable promontories; one near Samboangan to the westward; Cape St. Augustine to the eastward; and Surigao to the northward. It may be divided into three parts; the first under the sultan, who resides at Magindanao or Selangan, which formerly comprehended the greater part of the sea-\ncoast; the second is under the Spaniards, which includes a large portion of the sea-coast to the N.W. and N.E. where they have planted colonies of Christians from the Philippines, named Bisayans. The third is under the illanos (or hilloonas), sultans, and rajahs, who inhabit the banks of the great lake, or Llano, and thence inland to the hills. They also possess the coast of the great Llano Bay, situated on the south-east side of the island.\n\nMany of the districts above Boyan are subject to the Boyan Rajah, who is a Mahommedan, and has about 20,000 male inhabitants of that religion. To the north of Magindanao town is the harbour of Sugud or Pollok, which is one of the finest in India, and distinguished by a peaked hill above 200 feet high. At the harbour of Tuboc, formed by the Island of Ebus, is the chief place for assembling the piratical praws; and here the rajah has a house fortified with Spanish guns.\n\nThe Bay of Panguil, on the north-east side, cuts deep into the island, and receives the waters of many small rivers, where the piratical praws conceal themselves from the Spaniards. A little to the east of this bay is the Spanish town of Yligan, containing about 150 houses; beyond which lies the town of Cayagan, which has a fort and tolerably good harbour. This town contains 400 houses, and is situated on a considerable river, which goes far up a country whence gold is procured. The inhabitants on the sea-coast at Cayagan are Bisayau, or Philippine Christians, who carry on a friendly intercourse with the Mahommedan mountaineers and the horaforas of the interior. The Spanish jurisdiction formerly extended to Tandag and Catil, but their forts have been destroyed by the people of Magindanao. The harbours at both the last-named places are bad during the north-east monsoon, as they then lie on the windward side of the island.\n\nThe interior of Magindanao contains several chains of lofty mountains, between which are extensive plains, where vast flocks of cattle are pastured. Several deep chasms, or vallies, intersect certain parts of the country, through which, during the rains, great torrents rush to the sea. About the middle of the island are several lakes of considerable extent, the principal being the Great Llano, which is from 15 to 20 miles across, and about 60 in circumference. Many rivers discharge themselves into this lake; but only one is known to issue from it, which falls into the sea at Yligan. The borders are inhabited by various savage tribes, ruled by independent chiefs, entitled sultans and rajahs, whose subjects in 1776 were estimated at 61,000.\n\nIn the district of Kalagan is a high mountain, which at times discharges smoke, fire, and brimstone. When the mountain has not for any time thrown out any brimstone, the inhabitants suppose the god who rules it is angry. They therefore purchase, for five or six kangaus (pieces of cloth), an old slave, whose blood they shed to appease this deity.\n\nThis island is well wooded, and in many parts towards the sea-coast is covered with impenetrable jungle and forests; and most places in the interior are covered with timber trees, brushwood, reeds, or grass. The soil is well watered, there being streams everywhere, producing a most luxuriant vegetation. The species of trees that are most abundant are the teak, the larch, the poone, and the cassia tree. Rice is produced in great plenty; as also yams, sweet potatoes, cocoa nuts, pumplenos, mangoes, jacks, plantains, oranges, limes, and all fruits common to tropical climates. There are no ravenous wild beasts on the island; on which account deer, wild cattle, buffaloes, hogs, goats, and horses, multiply fast, the latter being of a small breed, but remarkable for their spirit.\n\nOn the hills inland, about 30 miles\nup the river of Magindanao, is a salt-petre cave of considerable extent, along the bottom of which there is a miry, glutinous mud. With one measure of this mud the natives mix two measures of wood-ashes, and then filter water through it; after which, by evaporation, they procure the nitre; but the gunpowder made from it is very coarse grained, and has but little strength. In the mountains of Kalangan, on the south-east quarter of the island, tale is found; and on the banks and sands it is said the pearl oyster has been discovered.\n\nThe horaforas, or aborigines of the interior, cultivate rice, sugar canes, potatoes, yams, pumpkins, and other vegetables, which they bring down to the sea-coast for sale; and they also, from rice and molasses mixed, make a liquor of a pleasant taste. In exchange for these articles the Malay inhabitants of the sea-coast give them iron chopping knives, cloth, salt, &c. The natives of Magindanao manufacture a cloth from the fibres of the plaintain tree, three yards long and one broad. This is the usual garment of the country women, and resembles a wide sack without a bottom, and is often used as a currency or measure of exchange in the market. The horaforas make a strong cloth from a species of flax.\n\nThe currency in most parts of the country is the Chinese kangan, (value 2s. 6d.) a piece of coarse cloth thinly woven, 19 inches broad, and six yards long. The value on the island of Sooloo is 10 dollars for a bundle of 25 kangans, sealed up; and at Magindanao is nearly the same, except that dollars are scarcer. In the bazar the immediate currency is rice in the husk; but when things of considerable value are mentioned, such as a house or prow, it is described as being worth so many slaves; the old valuation being one slave for 30 kangans, or bundles of cloth. China and Sooloo cash (thin pieces of copper perforated and strung on a cord) are also current.\n\nAll sorts of Hindostan cloth sells well here, especially long cloth, ordinary, blue, white, and red handkerchiefs; chintzes of dark grounds, Surat goods, especially pittollics, opium, and European cutlery. The Spaniards having long hindered the Chinese junk bound from Amoy to Magindanao from passing Samboangan, most Chinese articles are imported by the way of Sooloo. Besides kangans they consist of beads, gongs, China basins, deep brass plates, deep saucers, brass wire, and iron.\n\nThe chief places under the Magindanao Sultan, where gold is procured, are Curuan, Tikboo, Tubuan, and Eu near Kalangan; under the Spaniards are Emiloa, Cayagan, Sugrigao, Capasahan, Buluan, Adon, Ebon, Liangau, and Epunan. It is said that a Spanish governor, with 100 men, in 20 days, procured in the Caruan River 180 ounces of gold. In 1775 the value of this metal at Magindanao was about 2l. 10s. per ounce. Besides gold the principal exports are rice, wax, cassia, rattans, tobacco, and pepper. The Mahomedans on the sea coast carry on a considerable trade with the horaforas of the interior, who bring down, on rafts of bamboos, pumpkins, potatoes, rice, yams, &c., which they exchange for salt, cloth, and coarse cutlery.\n\nThe form of government at Magindanao is partly feudal and partly monarchical. Next to the sultan in rank is the Rajah Moodo, his successor elect, like the King of the Romans in Germany. The laws on the sea coast are nearly the same as in the other Malay states; in the interior, among the unconverted inhabitants, custom and superstition are the only guides by which they regulate their conduct. The vassals of the sultan are a mixture of Mahomedans and horaforas, the former accompany him on his military expeditions; the latter are excused attendance, but pay heavy taxes, and are sold along with the land.\nThe sultan's guards are generally captives and slaves from the Philippines. On grand days he has them dressed in uniforms of blue broad cloth turned up with red, and trimmed with white buttons of tin. On their heads they wear Spanish grenadiers' caps, inscribed with Yo el rey (the king). This monarch's palace is 120 feet long, by 50 broad, and is supported by 32 strong wooden pillars in four rows. The first floor is raised 14 feet from the ground, and in the lower part boats with their furniture and tackling are kept under cover. Some of the principal rooms are ornamented with scarlet cloth and Hindostan palampores.\n\nA Magindanao prow of a large size measures 90 feet long, 26 feet broad, and 8\u00bd feet deep; rows 40 oars, has two rudders, and carries a crew of 90 men. In building them they begin by dowling the planks one upon the other, so as never to require caulking; after which they fit the timbers, the beams going without, and clasping the planks like the burrs in the Bengal rivers; by which mode of building the vessel is very liable to become leaky at the beam ends. Some of their piratical cruisers are very long and narrow, being frequently 50 feet long, and only three broad, with outriggers to enable them to carry sail. They use the tripod mast, and row with great velocity. In bad weather they throw out a wooden anchor, and veer away a long rattan cable which keeps the head to the sea. Sometimes in an extremity the crew jump overboard, and hold by the outriggers for hours to ease the vessels of their weight. The owner finds nothing but the hull, for which he has one-third share of the prizes; the masts, sails, anchors, and cables, are made by the crew, who also find their own provisions, and make their own gunpowder.\n\nThe inhabitants of Magindanao, of all descriptions, are so much given to piracy, that their chiefs, were they inclined, could not restrain their subjects from fitting out vessels to cruise among the Philippines; which, to the disgrace of the Spaniards, is the grand cruising ground for all depredators in the Eastern Seas. During their cruizes they observe particular laws established by custom, and keep a certain order and discipline. Previous to sailing each man of the crew burns a bit of wax candle on a heap of coral rock stones, rudely piled near the river, which they assert to be the tomb of their great ancestor the Shereef, who first came to the island from Mecca. When the prow is large they strike the mast, and hide among the rocks and small islands, or up a creek. Canoes are then detached to plunder, and the proceeds are brought to the large vessel, which returns home when a sufficient cargo of slaves and plunder is acquired. When they attack the Dutch possessions they make slaves of persons of their own religion, which they otherwise endeavour to avoid. Besides the Philippines they extend their cruizes to Java, Sumatra, Borneo, and Celebes.\n\nFrom their vicinity to, and intercourse with, the Spanish Philippines, the inhabitants of Magindanao have acquired some of the European arts. In 1775 the Rajah Moodo, or sultan elect, could read and write Spanish, and was a performer on the violin, but musical gongs are the favourite instruments of the natives. They have goldsmiths who make filagree buttons, earrings, &c., but not so well as the Malays of Sumatra or Java. Their blacksmiths are incapable of making any thing that requires more ingenuity than a common nail, but they frequently have Philippine slaves who can mend gunlocks. Their culinary utensils they almost wholly procure from China.\n\nThe male inhabitants do not suffer their beards to grow, but pluck it out with pincers, which is a general custom among the Malays. Their favourite amusement is cock fighting, to which the Malays are universally addicted. They are moderate in\ntheir eating, and very temperate with respect to drinking. They bury their dead with great expedition, and generally begin making the coffin before the sick person's face, if the danger be eminent. Captain Forrest mentions having visited the widow of one of the principal chiefs, the day after her husband's death, who received him very kindly, and gave him a piece of beef which weighed four pounds.\n\nThe sultanas, and other females, do not appear to suffer the strict confinement to which they are subjected in Hindostan, as they are present at audiences and other public exhibitions. At the age of 13 the Magindanao ladies have their teeth filed thin, and stripped of the enamel, in order to have them stained black, which is performed with great ceremony, and among persons of high rank is preceded by a festival. When dignified females visit each other, they are accompanied by attendants of their own sex, sometimes exceeding 100 in number, who, as they draw near the house, set up a disagreeable howl to notify their approach, which must on no account be joined by any man, but is frequently by the dogs in the street. They play naneh at draughts on a chequer board, with different sorts of glass beads; and dance slowly in a circle, singing as they go round. On these occasions the men never mix with the women, nor do they touch or bow to them as they pass. When females of high rank walk abroad they assume a precise air and step, extending with their right hand a thin piece of silk to shade, but not to hide the face. A train of female attendants, slaves, and the husband's concubines follow, and the paths being narrow, they proceed one after the other in a long extended line.\n\nIn 1775, at the marriage of the sultan's daughter, the portion given with her was valued at 1500l. and consisted of various articles, amongst which were two iron four-pounders, valued at 100l. Captain Forrest, who was present, and describes the ceremony, informs us that when concluded, the company exclaimed with loud shouts for quarter of an hour, and then dispersed. The Magindanese have one name which they give their children during infancy, and another when they arrive at manhood; in which they resemble the Chinese, as in many other of their customs\u2014such as esteeming yellow the royal colour. The language of this island nearly coincides with the Lanoon dialect, and is a compound of Malay, Bugress, and Tagala, (Philippine) with a certain proportion of the ancient Ternate, or Molucca language.\n\nIn the interior are a people called Bangel Bangel, who do not build houses, but live under bushes, and in hollow trees. They eat the wild hogs, which they surprise in the puddles by covering their own bodies with mud, and in this manner approach them.\n\nThe horafors are thinly scattered over the island, and frequently migrate from one place to another. They wear brass rings round the wrist and under the knee, five or six on each leg and arm. They also have beads round their necks, and brass rings or beads in their ears, which in both sexes are very broad, and extend almost to their shoulders. Into the holes which are perforated in their ears, they put a leaf rolled up like the spring of a watch, in order to stretch them. The men of this tribe tie up their hair by fixing it round a piece of wood five or six inches in diameter, and half an inch thick, which is flat on their heads, and has a very graceful effect\u2014the hair being tied above and below it. The women tie their hair behind, plait it like the dancing girls at Madras, and wear a sort of petticoat. The weapons of the men are bows and arrows, and when they can afford to purchase, then swords, lances, and targets. By the Spaniards this race are termed Negros del Monte.\nor Negroes of the Mountain, whom they have had considerable success in converting, as they agree in one essential point\u2014the eating of hog flesh.\n\nThere remains no satisfactory records to inform us at what period Magindanao was visited by foreign nations, but it is probable that before the discovery of the Cape of Good Hope, ships from Arabia found their way to this island; and either converted the prior inhabitants, or planted new Mahommedan colonies on the sea coast. On Easter Day, 1521, Magellan arrived at Magindanao, where he ordered the first mass that was said in the Philippines. This took place in the province of Caraga and town of Batuan, where he set up the cross, and took possession of the island in the name of the King of Spain and Emperor of Germany, Charles the Fifth. It was visited by the Portuguese about 1537, and by the Dutch in 1607, 1616, and 1627. In 1689 an envoy was sent by the Dutch East India Company, with an offer of 2000 rix dollars for permission to build a fort, which was refused. The Dutch made a sort of survey of it in 1693, when it was much frequented by the English piratical vessels, which then swarmed in the Indian Seas. The Spaniards, although at an early period they subdued the northern coast, never made any further progress, and now with difficulty retain the feeble colonies they formerly planted.\n\nThe intercourse of the British with the Magindanese has not been frequent, and generally not of an amicable sort. The pirates from this island had the temerity to attack the settlement at Prince of Wales's Island soon after its establishment in 1788, but were repulsed with loss. In 1798 the Sultan of Magindanao city seized a boat's crew belonging to the La Sybille frigate, which had been sent on shore to wood and water. They were afterwards liberated, but not until a ransom of 4000 dollars had been paid. In 1803 the pirates from hence fitted out a fleet of 40 prows, with the intention of invading the India Company's settlements in Celebes, but were met by the Swift cruiser, and defeated with considerable loss. (Forrest, Leyden, Mears, Valentyn, Zu\u00f1iga, &c.)\n\nMagindanao.\u2014The principal town in the Island of Magindanao, and residence of the sultan. Lat. 7\u00b0.9' N. Long. 121\u00b0.40' E.\n\nThis place is situated about six miles up the Pelaungy (or Magindanao River), on the right hand side at its junction with the Malampy, after which the Malampy is about the breadth of the Thames at London bridge. Higher up this river has other branches. The mouth of the Pelaungy being sheltered by the Island of Bunwoot, has a smooth bar almost at all times. Coming from sea, the water suddenly shoals from ten to five fathoms on the bar, within which it is two and a half and three fathoms at low water.\n\nThe town properly called Magindanao is small, but on the opposite side of the river, communicating by several bridges, is the town of Selangan; the two in fact forming but one town, under different names, the latter being the most prevalent among the natives of the country. Selangan extends about a mile down the south side of the River Pelaungy, and contains the fortified palace of the sultan, and also strong wooden castles, belonging to some of the chief nobles. Further down the river, the town extends into several irregular streets, amounting in the whole to 220 houses, where many Chinese reside. Here is also the brick and mortar foundation of a Spanish chapel.\n\nIn an island like Magindanao, where the country is thinly inhabited, and the land of little value, the inhabitants (particularly the Mahommedans) dislike crowding together, and prefer building their houses at 300 yards distance from each other, along the banks of the river, surrounded by gardens of\ncocoa nut, mango, and plantain trees, and fields of rice and sugar cane. The fort is on the extreme point of land, in extent about six acres, and is strongly pallisaded, with a floor of stout plank, supported by posts and beams. On this are mounted five pieces of cannon, six and nine pounders, which command both branches of the river. On the ground are several pieces of heavy cannon, and all round the fort are mounted brass swivel guns, and some brass ramsackers, which carry a half pound ball.\n\nThe rivers here wind through a plain about 12 miles broad, extending N. E. 40 miles, and S. E. as far as the lakes of Leguassin and Bulooan; the inhabitants consequently travel mostly by water in sampans or canoes of different sizes. It is customary along the river, where there is a house, to rail off a part against the alligators, in order to bathe in safety. The highest tide here rises six feet and a half, which is sufficient to overflow the adjacent lands, but not to any great depth. On the side of the town next the Pelangy River many Chinese families reside, who are mostly carpenters, arrack makers, and distillers. The exports from hence are rice, wax, cassia, rattans, tobacco, pepper, and gold\u2014the traffic being principally carried on with Sooloo, Manilla, Borneo, and the Meluecas. The Sultan of Magindanao town and district is one of the most powerful of the Malay princes, and possesses considerable feudal authority over other chiefs; his direct territorial jurisdiction is, however, limited to the country in the immediate neighbourhood of this city. (Forrest, Macares, &c.)\n\nMahabalipuram, (or the Seven Pagodas).\u2014A small town on the sea coast of the Carnatic, 38 miles S. by W. from Madras. Lat. 12\u00b0. 23'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 18'. E.\n\nIn the vicinity of this town are the celebrated ruins of ancient Hindu temples dedicated to Vishnu, generally called the Seven Pagodas, but it is not known for what reason, as no such number exists here. The name means the city of the great Bali, a character very famous in Hindoo romance. The eye is first attracted by a high rock or rather hill of stone, covered with Hindoo sculptures and works of imagery, so thickly scattered as to convey the idea of a petrified town. Facing the sea there is a pagoda of one single stone, about 16 or 18 feet high, which seems to have been cut on the spot out of a detached rock. On the outside surface of the rock are bass relief sculptures, representing the most remarkable persons, whose actions are celebrated in the Mahabharat. Another part of the rock is hollowed out into a spacious room, apparently for the purpose of a choultry.\n\nOn ascending the hill there is a temple cut out of the solid rock, with some figures of idols in alto relievo upon the walls, very well finished. At another part of the hill there is a gigantic figure of Vishnu, asleep on a bed, with a huge snake wound round in many coils as a pillow, which figures are all of one piece hewn out of the rock. A mile and a half to the southward of the hill are two pagodas about 30 feet long by 20 wide, and the same in height cut out of the solid rock, and each consisting originally of one single stone. Near to these is the figure of an elephant, as large as life, and of a lion much larger than the natural size; but otherwise a just representation of the real lion, which is, however, an animal unknown in this neighbourhood, or in the south of India. The whole of these sculptures appear to have been rent by some convulsion of nature, before they were finished.\n\nThe great rock above-described is about 106 yards from the sea; but, on the rocks washed by the sea, are sculptures, indicating that they once were out of it. East of the village, and washed by the sea, is a pagoda\nof stone, containing the Lingam, and dedicated to Mahadeva. The surf here breaks far out, and (as the Brahmins assert) over the ruins of the city of Mahabalipuram, which was once large and magnificent; and there is reason to believe, from the traditional records of the natives, that the sea, on this part of the Coromandel coast, has been encroaching on the land. All the most ancient buildings and monuments at this place are consecrated to Vishnu, whose worship appears to have predominated on this coast; while, on the opposite coast, in the neighbourhood of Bombay, that of Mahadeva, or Siva, prevailed to a greater extent. (Chambers, Goldingham, M. Graham, Lord Valentia, &c. &c.)\n\nMAHARATTA, (Maharashtra.)\n\nIn the ancient tables of the Hindoos, the term Maharashtra occurs as the name of a geographical division of the Deccan, referring principally to the north-west quarter. The best modern accounts lead us to suppose, that the original country of the Maharattas included Khandesh, Baglana, and part of Berar, extending towards the north-west as far as Gujrat and the Nerbudda River, where the Grassias and Bheels commence, there being few genuine Maharattas seen further north. To the north-west they possessed the narrow but strong tract of country, which borders on the Concan, and stretches parallel with the sea from near Surat to Canara. The Maharatta language is now more widely spread; but it is not yet become the vernacular dialect of provinces, situated far beyond the ancient boundaries of their country. From Beed it is spread over the whole country to the north-westward of Canara, and of a line, which, passing considerably to the eastward of Dowletabad, takes an irregular sweep until it touches the Tuptee River, and follows the course of that river to the western sea; on which border Sedasheogur, in North Canara, forms the northern limit. In the Aravi, or Tamul language, the Maharattas are named Aray.\n\nThe original Maharatta state comprehended a country of great natural strength, interspersed with mountains, defiles, and fortresses, and admirably calculated for the prosecution of defensive warfare; but that they were not of the military caste is proved by the names of their then principal tribes\u2014the Koombee, the Duniagar, and the Goalah; or, the farmer, shepherd, and cowherd\u2014all rural occupations. The exterior, also, of the Rajpoets and Maharattas marks a different origin. The first is remarkable for the grace and dignity of his person; the latter, on the contrary, is of diminutive size, in general badly made, and of a mean rapacious disposition. The Maharatta Brahmins, also, differ in their customs from their neighbours, with whom they will neither associate nor intermarry.\n\nIt certainly appears extraordinary, that a nation so numerous as the Maharattas should have remained almost wholly unnoticed in Indian history, for as long a period as from the first Mahommedan conquest until the reign of Aurengzebe; but it probably originated from the indifference of all Mahommedan authors (except Abul Fazel) to everything connected either with the Hindoos or their religion. One respectable author (Major Willford) seems inclined to consider them as foreigners, who migrated into India from the western parts of Persia, about 1200 years ago, which, were the fact sufficiently established, is an era long prior to the Mahommedan incursions. Nursingh, a prince of the Maharattas, in A.D. 1391, is mentioned by Ferishta; but it is probable, that prior to the time of Sevajee, the Maharatta country, like the other parts of the Deccan, was divided into little principalities and chiefships; many of which were\ndependant on the neighbouring Mahomedan princes, but never completely brought under subjection.\n\nSevajee, the first Maharatta commander, who combined the efforts of these discordant chiefs and tribes, was born in A.D. 1626, and died in 1680. His genealogy being obscure, his adherents were at liberty to invent the most illustrious; and, accordingly, traced his origin from the Ranahs of Odeypoor, (the purest of the Khetri caste,) who claim a descent, equally fabulous, from Noushirwan the Just. The conquests of Sevajee were extended by his son, Sambajee, who unfortunately fell into the hands of Aurengzebe in 1689, and was put to death. He was succeeded by his son, Sahoo Rajah, whose successes far exceeded those of his father or grandfather. He reigned upwards of 50 years, and, at his death, in 1740, the Maharatta empire had reached its zenith. This race, whose name and existence we can with difficulty trace for the short period of one century, had either subdued or laid under contribution the whole of the Deccan and south of India. Their dominions eastward and westward were bounded by the sea, and stretched, north and south, from Agra to Cape Comorin.\n\nSahoo Rajah was succeeded by his son, Ram Rajah; a weak prince, who was confined to the fortress of Satarah by the two chief officers of state, the Peshwa, and Buxshee (paymaster), Bajeerow, and Ragoojee. The former (a Concany Brahmin) assumed the western Maharatta empire, fixing his capital at Poonah; while the latter ruled the eastern, and made Nagpoor, in the province of Gundwana, the seat of his government.\n\nThe usurpation of these chiefs occasioned that of others, and the state begun to break from the united shape it had hitherto possessed into a confederacy of chiefs; who, however, for a period, respected each other's rights, and acted under the leading influence and able direction of Bajeerow. They not only carried their successful ravages to the banks of the Indus, and through the rich provinces of Bengal, but wrested from the Portuguese the important Fort of Basscin, and the Island of Salsette.\n\nBajeerow died in 1759, and left the office of Peshwa, which was now considered as hereditary, to his son, Ballajee. About this time a formidable rival to the Maharattas appeared in the famous Ahmed Shah Abdalli, of Cabal; and, on the 7th of January, 1761, was fought the memorable battle of Paniput, when the Maharattas experienced one of the most sanguinary defeats recorded in history. This checked the enterprising spirit of the Maharattas; and, for more than ten years, none of their armies committed any depredations of consequence to the north of the Nerbuddah.\n\nBallajeeerow died soon after the action of Paniput, and was succeeded by his son, Madhoorow, who died in 1772; and was succeeded by his son, Narain Row, who was murdered the following year by his uncle, Ragobah; who, however, failed in his object, as the posthumous son of Narain Row was proclaimed Peshwa, by a combination of twelve ships, styled Bara Bye. At the head of these was Ballajee Pundit, commonly called Nanah Furnaveze, who became Dewan, or prime minister, to the infant prince.\n\nBagobah solicited and gained the support of the Bombay government, with which he concluded a treaty highly advantageous to the Company; but their endeavours to support his claim were ineffectual. The atrocity of Ragobah's crime had brought general obloquy on him among a nation, with whom assassination is unfrequent; and his calling-in foreign aid had the effect of producing a junction against him of the whole Maharatta empire. By the interference of the Bengal government a treaty was concluded; but, in 1777, the Bombay govern-\nment again espoused the cause of Ragobah; and a war ensued, which was terminated in a short time by a disgraceful convention, and Ragobah was abandoned. A general war afterwards ensued between the English and Maharattas, in which the latter acted on the defensive; but it was judged expedient to make a peace, on account of the Carnatic invasion by Hyder, and it was concluded, by Mr. Anderson, in 1782; by the conditions of which every conquest was restored, except the Island of Salsette.\n\nAt this period there were a great many petty independent states, which extended along the western frontiers of the Company's dominions, and formed a barrier towards the Maharatta territories. In 1784 the Maharattas commenced their operations against these states; and, in the course of six or seven years, the whole were completely subdued, and annexed and rendered tributary to the Maharatta empire, which, by these encroachments, came in contact with the British dominions. In 1785-6, the Poonah Maharattas, in conjunction with the Nizam, carried on an unsuccessful war with Tippoo, and were obliged to purchase peace with the cession of some valuable provinces\u2014all of which they recovered, by their alliance with the British, in 1790.\n\nMadhurow, the young Peshwa, died suddenly the 27th of October, 1795, and the government was rent by the internal dissensions which followed this event\u2014Bajecerow and Chimmajee, the surviving sons of Ragobah, being alternately raised to the throne by the contending factions. At this time the Peshwa's authority extended no further than that branch of the Maharatta state termed the Poonah Sait\u2014comprising most of the original country of that tribe, but none of their conquests. The eldest brother, Bajecerow, after experiencing many vicissitudes, was at last fixed on the throne by the powerful assistance of Dowlet Row Sindia, who permitted him to enjoy nothing of the sovereignty but the name.\n\nOn the 25th of October, 1802, the army of Dowlet Row Sindia, combined with that of the Peshwa, was totally defeated, near Poonah, by Jeswunt Row Holcar; and, on the same day, he fled towards Severndroog, in the Concan, where he embarked for Bassein, which he reached on the 1st of December. On the 31st of that month a treaty of perpetual friendship and alliance was concluded between the Peshwa and the British government; by the conditions of which, the friends and enemies of the one were to be considered in the same relation to the other. The Peshwa agreed to receive into his dominions a subsidiary force of 6000 infantry, with their usual proportion of field pieces and European artilleryman attached\u2014for the payment of which he assigned districts in the southern quarter of his country. In 1803, an addition of one regiment of native cavalry was made to this force, and the above districts exchanged for the province of Bundelcund. This treaty annihilated the Maharattas as a federal empire, and, in its stead, established the relatively independent states of the Peshwa, the Rajah of Nagpoor, Sindia, Holcar, and the Guicowar. In the beginning of May, 1803, the Peshwa Bajecerow was reinstated at Poonah, by General Wellesley, and has ever since remained firmly attached to the British government, which assisted him to settle all his difference with the numerous chiefs subordinate to the Poonah state.\n\nThe Maharatta constitution, from the commencement, has always been more aristocratic than despotic, and the local arrangements of their empire peculiar\u2014the territory of the different hostile chiefs being blended or interspersed with each other. Great part of the Peshwa's dominions extends along the west coast of India; yet, until the treaty of\nBassein, he possessed territory to the north of Delhi, and now holds a district within a few miles of Surat. It is no uncommon thing for a district, or even a single town, to belong to two or three chiefs; and, until lately, some were the joint property of the Peshwa and the Nizam.\n\nThe Peshwa, although the acknowledged head of the Maharatta empire, holds very little territory of his own. In 1804 his territory and revenue were estimated as follows; viz:\n\n**IN GUJRAT.**\n\n| Town          | Revenue |\n|---------------|---------|\n| Almood        | -       |\n| Jumbosceir    | -       |\n| Dubboi        | -       |\n| Concan        | -       |\n| Severndroog   | -       |\n\n**ABOVE THE GHAUTS, N. AND W. OF POONAH.**\n\n| Town          | Revenue |\n|---------------|---------|\n| Jumner        | -       |\n| Singumner     | -       |\n| Ahmednuggur   | -       |\n\n**ADDED BY TREATY OF SERINGAPATAM.**\n\n| Town          | Revenue |\n|---------------|---------|\n| Savanore      | -       |\n| Banca poor    | -       |\n| Darwar        | -       |\n| Part of Bundelcund | - |\n\nTotal Revenue: **Rupees 7,164,724**\n\nAll this revenue is not realized, as a considerable part is absorbed in the expenses of collection; but, on the other hand, the security afforded by the presence of a British subsidiary force precludes the necessity of his retaining a large army for defensive purposes. The Peshwa's jurisdiction nominally comprehends a vast extent of territory, as the Guicowar is still considered as his feudatory. At the court of Poonah all the high offices are hereditary. The Dewan (prime minister), the Furnaveze (chancellor), the Chitnavaze (a civil officer), and even the commander-in-chief, or bearer of the Jerryput, (the national standard), are all situations held by descent.\n\nIt is one peculiar feature in the Maharatta constitution, that the government always considers itself in a state of war, which formerly was a principal source of revenue. On the day of the festival, called the Dussera, or Durga Poojah, towards the end of September, at the breaking up of the rains, the Maharattas used to prepare for their plundering excursions. On this occasion they wash their horses, sacrificing to each a sheep, whose blood is sprinkled with some ceremony, and the flesh eaten with none. In 1797, Dowlet Row Sindia was supposed to have slaughtered 12,000 sheep: the Brahmin chiefs give their servants money for this purpose. The Maharatta soldiers eat almost everything indiscriminately, except beef and tame swine; they will eat wild hogs. The Maharatta country abounds with horses, and there are some of a very fine breed, called the Beemarteddy, (raised near the Beemah River); but the common Maharatta horse, used in war, is a lean, ill-looking animal, with large bones, and commonly about 14 or 14\u00bd hands high. The only weapon used by the horsemen is a sabre; in the use of which, and management of their horses, they are extremely dexterous. For defence they wear a quilted jacket of cotton cloth, which comes half way down their thighs. The number of genuine Maharattas in the conquered provinces, remote from the seat of government, did not use to bear a much greater proportion to the natives of these countries than the British in India at present do. The territories which they possessed in Upper Hindostan were, for many years, only secured to their authority by the introduction of European officers into their armies, who opposed a system of discipline to the irregular valour of the Rajpoots and native Mahomedans.\n\nIn the different governments of the native powers, as in most de-\nspotic ones, the prince, unless he possesses great talents, becomes a mere cipher, the prime-minister engrossing all the authority. To this rule the Maharatta states are not an exception, and this important office is uniformly bestowed on the person who can furnish the largest sum of money for some particular exigence; consequently every subordinate situation is disposed of to the highest bidder; and to the most dignified chief in the Maharatta empire a bribe may be offered, not only without offence, but with a positive certainty of success.\n\nAmong this people the gradual progress of refinement is discernable from the wild predatory Maharatta, almost semi-barbarous to the polished and insidious Brahmin, whose specious politeness and astonishing command of temper leave all European hypocrisy in the shade. This extraordinary urbanity qualifies them, in the highest degree, for all public business. The bulk of the people under the Maharatta government are almost without property; few having an opportunity of acquiring wealth, except the powerful Brahmins, who are the principal functionaries under the state. Their avarice is insatiable; and, if ever the madness of accumulation was accompanied by the highest degree of folly, it is here exemplified; for, although the Brahmin be permitted to go on for years in the practice of extortion, his wealth at last attracts the attention of the prince, when he is obliged to disgorge, and is perhaps confined in a fortress for life. If he happens to die in office, his property is generally sequestrated. This mode of raising money forms a considerable part of the contingent revenue, and is known by the name of goona-geecee, or crime penalty. Among the Maharatta chiefs, merchants and commerce meet with protection and encouragement; and, among Hindoos generally, even in the most rapacious governments, this class of people are less molested than might have been expected. (MSS. Tone, Lord Valentia, Moore, Lord Lauderdale, Treaties, Calebrooke, &c.)\n\n**Mahanuddy River, (Mahanadi).**\n\nThis river has its source in the province of Gundwana, where the exact spot has not yet been ascertained; but it is probably in the neighbourhood of Kyrahgur, or Conkair. From hence it proceeds towards the Bay of Bengal, with an uncommonly winding course, watering many wild Goand districts, Sumblapoor, and part of Orissa, until it arrives in the province of Cuttack, where it receives the streams of the Sotundee, the Gaintee, the Bitrunnee, the Cnrsan, the Bamoni, and the Comorea.\n\nAbout two miles to the west of Cuttack town, the Catjoura, separating itself from the Mahanuddy, flows to the southward of the town; while the Mahanuddy, passing under the fort of Barabuttee to the north, bends its course to the Bay of Coojung, where it falls into the Bay of Bengal, insulating the spot in the form of a Delta. Its whole course, including the windings, may be estimated at 550 miles. (Leckie, Blunt, &c. &c.)\n\n**Mahaim.\u2014A small town on the Island of Bombay, where there is the tomb of a Mahommadan saint, with a mosque attached to it. Here is also a Portuguese church, to which is annexed a college for Roman Catholic priests; but those who pretend to learning usually study at Goa, where they learn to speak barbarous Latin. A small premium is given at the church for every child that is baptized; consequently a number of native women present their children for that purpose. (M. Graham, &c.)**\n\n**Mahim, (Mahima).\u2014A town belonging to the Peshwa, on the sea-coast of the province of Aurungabad, 51 miles north from Bombay. Lat. 19\u00b0. 39'. N., Long. 72\u00b0. 48'. E.**\n\n**Mahi, (Mahi, a Fish).\u2014A town on the sea-coast of the Malabar Province, being the principal French settlement on this coast. Lat. 11\u00b0.**\n42\u00b0 N. Long. 75\u00b0 38' E. This place is finely situated on a high ground, on the south side of a river, where it joins the sea; and the site is in every respect preferable to that of the neighbouring British settlement of Tillichery. It may be here remarked, that generally all the spots selected by the French for the establishment of their factories in India were, in point of local circumstances and geographical situation, much superior to those chosen by the English. The latter appear to have been influenced by the temporary resort of commerce; while the first were guided by more enlarged views, which to them, however, never have had any beneficial result.\n\nThe river at Mahe is navigable for boats a considerable way inland, and in fair weather small craft can with great safety pass the bar. The town has been neat, and many of the houses are good; but the whole have been in a decaying state until lately, since the British commercial residence has been removed to this place from Tellicherry. The principal export is pepper, the staple commodity of the province. Mahe was settled by the French in 1722, but taken from them by the British forces under Major Hector Munro in 1761. It was restored at the peace of Paris in 1763; but on the rupture with France in 1793 recaptured, and retained ever since. (F. Buchanan, Orme, &c.)\n\nMahmudabad.\u2014A town in the province of Agra, district of Farruckabad, 10 miles S. W. from the town of Farruckabad. Lat. 27\u00b0 19'. N. Long. 79\u00b0 25'. N.\n\nMahmudpoor.\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, 75 miles N. E. from Calcutta. Lat. 23\u00b0 24'. N. Long. 89\u00b0 34'. E.\n\nMahmudshi, (Mahmudshahi).\u2014A zemindary in the province of Bengal, surrounded on all sides by that of Rajeshy, and mostly situated on the southern bank of the Ganges. In 1784 it contained 844 square miles, and had been held by the Brahmin family of Deo from the time of the Soubahdar Jaffer Khan. Like the rest of the south of Bengal, it is intersected by innumerable branches of the Ganges, and well situated for inland commerce. In some parts the mulberry is cultivated, but rice and esculents are its staple productions. (J. Grant, &c.)\n\nMahomdy.\u2014A town in the Nabob of Oude's territories, 83 miles N. N. W. from Lucknow. Lat. 27\u00b0 56'. N. Long. 80\u00b0 19'. E.\n\nMahoor, (Malwar).\u2014A district in the Nizam's territories, in the province of Berar, situated about the 20th degree of north latitude. The surface of this district comprehends part of a high table land, between the Wurdah and the Godavery rivers, including many naturally strong positions. It is on the whole but thinly inhabited, and indifferently cultivated. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Mahoor, containing 20 mahals; revenue, 42,885,444 dams; seyurghal, 97,844 dams.\"\n\nMahoor.\u2014A town belonging to the Nizam, in the province of Berar, the capital of a district of the same name. Lat. 20\u00b0 4'. N. Long. 78\u00b0 33'. E.\n\nMahowl.\u2014A town in the province of Allahabad, district of Jionpoor, 47 miles S. E. from Fyzabad. Lat. 26\u00b0 18'. N. Long. 82\u00b0 42'. N.\n\nMahrajegunge.\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Purneah, 30 miles N. E. from the town of Purneah. Lat. 26\u00b0 4'. N. Long. 87\u00b0 47'. E.\n\nMahy River, (Myhi).\u2014This river originates in the province of Malwah, district of Oojain, not far from the source of the Chumbul. It first proceeds to the N. W. but afterwards pursues a S. W. course, and falls into the Gulf of Cambay, in the district of Broach, having performed a course, including the windings, of about 280 miles. Although it flows through so considerable an extent of country, the body of its waters never attains to any great magnitude.\nThroughout the Marassse villages on the banks of this river, and in many others under an unsettled government in Gujrat, the natives dwell in wickered cabins, supported by slender bows, and covered with grass and leaves, but scarcely affording protection from the weather. Sometimes to realize the balances of the revenue, the collectors under the native governments set fire to these hamlets; and, sometimes to evade payment, the inhabitants burn them, and retire with their flocks and families into the impervious jungles, where they remain until an arrangement is effected. The term Maheevasse, or Mewassee, properly belongs to people inhabiting the banks of the Mahy River; but the phrase has been by strangers applied to all depredators in general. The roads to the north of this river are much infested by the Dinga tribe of Coolee thieves. (Drummond, &c.)\n\nMailcotta, (Mailcotay).\u2014A town in the Mysore Rajah's territories, situated on a high rocky hill, commanding a view of the valley, watered by the Cavery, 13 miles north from Seringapatam. Lat. 12\u00b0. 38'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 52'. E.\n\nThis is one of the most celebrated places of Hindoo worship, as having been honoured with the actual presence of an Avatar, or incarnation of Vishnu, as Narasingha (or the man-lion), in which character he founded one of the temples. It is also one of the principal seats of the Sri Vaishnavan Brahmins. The large temple is a square building, of great dimensions, and entirely surrounded by a colonnade; but it is a mean piece of architecture outwardly. The columns are of very rude workmanship, and only six feet high. The structure, as it stands, is said to have been put into its present form by Rama Anuja Acharya, who is generally supposed to have lived about the year 1000 of the Christian era.\n\nThe tank is a very fine one, and surrounded by buildings for the accommodation of religious persons. The natives believe that every year the waters of the Ganges are miraculously conveyed to it by subterraneous passages. The jewels belonging to the great temple are very valuable, and even Tippoo Sultan was afraid to seize them. The houses amount to about 400, of which more than half are occupied by Brahmins. The houses are tiled, and covered with thorns, to prevent the monkeys roofing them. (F. Buchanan, &c. &c.)\n\nMaiissore, or Mysore, (Mahesasura).\u2014A town in the province of Mysore, and its metropolis, until the subversion of the Mysore Rajah's dynasty by Hyder. Lat. 12\u00b0. 16'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 52'. E.\n\nThis place is about nine miles distant from Seringapatam, and in the same valley; but in a more elevated situation, and probably more healthy. Tippoo, to destroy every vestige of the dynasty which his father had deposed, removed the town to a small eminence, distant above one mile, and gave it a new name, as was his custom. After having completed it he discovered that there was no water, and that the place was not habitable. The war with the British, in 1799, put an end to the work; for the rajah, on his restoration, immediately began to carry off the materials to their old station. The new town which has arisen near the seat of government is about a mile long, consisting of one incipial street. The rajah's fort is well built, and kept in tolerably good order.\n\nThe fort at this place was either built or repaired in the year 1524; and the new name assigned to it, of Mahesh Asoor, now contracted to Mysore. Prior to this period it was named Puragurry. Mahesh Asoor is the name of a buffalo-headed monster, whose overthrow constitutes one of the most celebrated exploits of the goddess Cali. In the year 1593 it was taken by the Adil Shahce sovereigns of Bejapoor, at which era it belonged to Necta-\ndari Naik. (Lord Valentia, Wilks, Ferishta, &c.)\n\nMaissy, (Mahesi).\u2014A town in the province of Bahore, district of Bettiah, 54 miles north from Patna. Lat. 26\u00b0 20'. N. Long. 85\u00b0 7'. E.\n\nMasull.\u2014A large island in Assam, formed by the Brahmapootra, the length of which is estimated at 160 miles, and the utmost breadth 60. This insulated district is intersected by channels of communication between the two branches, which in reality convert it into a cluster of distinct islands. They all possess a rich soil, above a deeper layer of sand, and often of clay. The small islands formed by the channels are called Chapoori. (Wade, &c.)\n\nMakewara.\u2014A small town in the province of Delhi, district of Sirhind, within four and a half miles distance of the Sutuleje River; the course of which, about 35 years ago, ran under it, but has now taken a more northerly direction. (11th Register, &c. &c.)\n\nMALABAR. (Malayavar, the Region of Mount Malaya).\n\nThis region extends along the western coast of India, from Cape Comorin to the River Chandragiri, in Lat. 12\u00b0 27'. N. but the term is frequently erroneously applied to the whole country, from Bombay to the southern extremity. The province of Malabar is a particular part of the coast to which this name is appropriated, the other modern subdivisions in maps being Cochin and Travancor; but in the Hindoo geographical systems the whole region is denominated Kerala. The Malabar language extends from Cape Comorin as far north as Neelisaram, where commences the country of Tulava (misnamed Cannara), and the Tulava language. In some ancient tables Tulava is considered as a subdivision of Kerala, which is said to have extended from Gaukarna, round Cape Comorin, to the River Tumbrapurni in Tinnevelly.\n\nThis country being intersected by many rivers, and bounded by the sea and high mountains, presented so many obstacles to invaders, that it escaped subjugation by the Mahomedans until it was attacked by Hyder in 1766; the original manners and customs of the Hindoos have, consequently, been preserved much purer than in most parts of India. The other inhabitants of Malabar are Moplays (or Mahomedans), Christians, and Jews; but their number, collectively, is small, compared with that of the Hindoos, some of whose most remarkable manners and customs shall be here described, reserving the more local details for the three geographical subdivisions respectively.\n\nThe rank of caste on the Malabar coast is as follows:\n\n1st. The Namboories, or Brahmans.\n2d. The Nairs, of various denominations.\n3d. The Tears, or Tiars, who are cultivators of the land, and free men.\n4th. The Malears, who are musicians and conjurors, and also free men.\n5th. The Poliar, who are slaves or bondmen attached to the soil.\n\nThe system of distances to be observed by these castes is specified below, viz.\n\n1st. A Nair may approach, but not touch a Brahmin.\nA Tear must remain 36 steps off.\nA Poliar 96 steps off.\n\n2d. A Tear is to remain 12 steps distant from a Nair.\nA Malear three or four steps further.\nA Poliar 96 steps.\n\n3dly. A Malear may approach, but not touch a Tear.\n4thly. A Poliar is not to come near even to a Malear, or any other caste. If he wishes to speak to a Brahmin, Nair, Tear, or Malear, he must stand at the above prescribed distance, and cry aloud to them.\n\nIf a Poliar touch a Brahmin, the latter must make expiation by im-\nmediately bathing, reading much of the divine books, and changing his Brahminical thread. If a Poliar touch a Nair, or any other caste, bathing is sufficient. In some parts of the province, Churmun is a term applied to slaves in general, whatever their caste be, but it is in some other parts confined to the Poliars peculiarly. Even among these wretched creatures the pride of caste has full influence; and if a Poliar be touched by another slave of the Pariar tribe, he is defiled, and must wash his head and pray.\n\nThe Parian, in the plural Pariar, belong to a tribe of Malabar below all caste, all of whom are slaves. In the countries where the Tamil language prevails, a tribe of the same name is common, but the customs of the two are not the same. In Malabar the Pariars acknowledge the superiority even of the Niadis, but pretend to be higher than two other races. This tribe eat carrion, and even beef, so that they are looked upon as equally impure with the Mahomedans and Christians.\n\nThe Niadis are an outcaste tribe common in Malabar, but not numerous. They are reckoned so very impure, that even a slave of caste will not touch them. They have some miserable huts built under trees, but they generally wander about in companies of 10 or 12, keeping a little distance from roads; and when they see any passenger, they set up a howl like dogs that are hungry. Those who are moved by compassion lay down what they are inclined to bestow, and go away; the Niadis afterwards approach, and pick up what has been left. They have no marriage ceremony, but one man and one woman always associate together. They kill tortoises, and sometimes alligators, both of which they eat, and consider excellent food.\n\nThe next most remarkable caste are the Nairs, who are the pure Sudras of Malabar, and all pretend to be born soldiers, but they are of various ranks and professions. The highest in rank are the Kirit, or Kirrun Nairs, who on all public occasions act as cooks, which among Hindoos is a sure mark of transcendent rank, for every person may eat food prepared by a person of a higher caste than himself. The second rank of Nairs are more particularly named Sudras, but the whole acknowledge themselves, and are allowed to be of pure Sudra origin. There are altogether 11 ranks of Nairs.\n\nThis caste form the militia of Malabar, directed by the Brahmins, and governed by rajahs. Before the country was disturbed by foreign invasion, their submission to their superiors was great; but they exacted deference from those under them with a cruelty and arrogance rarely practised, but by Hindoos in their state of dependence. A Nair was expected instantly to cut down a Tear (cultivator) or mucuna (fisherman), who presumed to defile him by touching his person; and a similar fate awaited a Poliar, or Paliar, who did not turn out of his road as a Nair passed. The peculiar deity of the Nair caste is Vishnu, but they wear on their foreheads the mark of Siva, or Mahadeva. The proper road to heaven they describe as follows:\n\nThe votary must go to Benares, and afterwards perform the ceremony in commemoration of his ancestors at Gaya. He must then take up water from the Ganges, and pour it on the image of Siva at Rameswara, in the Straits of Ceylon. After this he must visit the principal places of pilgrimage\u2014such as Juggernaut in Orissa, and Tripetty in the Carnatic. He must always speak the truth, and give much charity to learned and poor Brahmins; and, lastly, he must frequently fast and pray, and be very chaste in his conduct.\n\nThe Nairs marry before they are 10 years of age, but the husband never cohabits with his wife. He allows her oil, clothing, ornaments, and food; but she remains in her mother's house, or after her parents'\ndeath with her brothers, and cohabits with any person she chooses of an equal or higher rank than her own. In consequence of this strange arrangement, no Nair knows his father, and every man considers his sister's children as his heirs. His mother manages the family, and after her death the eldest sister assumes the direction. A Nair's moveable property, on his decease, is equally divided among the sons and daughters of all his sisters.\n\nAll Nairs pretend to be soldiers, but they do not all follow the martial profession. There are supposed to be 30 distinct classes of this general tribe, many of whom practise the arts of husbandry, accounts, weaving, carpenters' work, pottery, and oil making. Formerly, however, they were all liable to be called on by their sovereigns to perform military service. They are still very fond of parading up and down fully armed, the consequence is that assassinations are very frequent. Most of the Nairs and Malabar Hindoos are as remarkable for a thoughtless profusion, as in other parts they are notorious for economy. The Nairs generally are excessively addicted to intoxicating liquors, and are permitted to eat venison, goats, fowls, and fish.\n\nFrom the time of Cheruman Permal until that of Hyder, Malabar was governed by the descendants of 13 Nair chiefs sisters; among whom, and among the different branches of the same families, there subsisted a constant confusion and change of property, which was greatly increased by many inferior chiefs assuming sovereign power. The country thus became subdivided in a manner of which there is no other example, and it was a common saying in Malabar, that a man could not take a step without going from one chief's dominions into those of another. Hyder taking advantage of these dissensions, subdued the northern division now called the Province of Malabar; while the Rajah of Travancor, and the Cochin Rajah, subdued all the chiefs of the central and southern divisions.\n\nTo a European the succession among the Malabar chiefs appears very extraordinary, and as an instance that of the Shekury family may be described. The males of this family are called achuns, and never marry. The ladies are called naitears, and live in the houses of their brothers, whose families they manage. They have no husbands, but may grant their favours to any person of the Khetri caste, who is not an achun. All the male children of these princesses become achuns, all the female naitears, and all are of equal rank according to seniority; but they are divided into two houses, descended from two sisters of the first shekury rajah. The eldest male of the family is called the shekury, or first rajah; the second is called ellea rajah; the third cavashiry rajah; the fourth talan tambouran rajah; and the fifth tariputamura rajah. On the death of the shekury, the ellea rajah succeeds to the highest dignity; each inferior rajah gets a step, and the eldest, entitled achun, becomes tariputamura. There are at present between one and 200 achuns, and each receives a certain proportion of the fifth part of the revenue, which has been granted by the British government for their support.\n\nThe Cunian, or Cunishun, are a caste of Malabar, whose profession is astrology; besides which they make umbrellas, and cultivate the earth. In many parts of India, the astrologer, or wise man, whatever his caste may be, is called a Cunishun. They are of so low a caste, that if a Cunian come within 24 feet of a Brahmin, the latter must purify himself by prayer and ablution. They are said to possess powerful mantras (charms) from fragments of the fourth Veda, which is usually alleged to be lost.\n\nAt a very early period the Christian religion made a considerable pro-\ngress on the Malabar Coast, which contains in proportion more persons professing that religion than any other country in India. The hierarchical system of the Roman Catholic church on the Malabar Coast consists of three ecclesiastical chiefs; two of which are appointed by the Portuguese church at Goa, and one by the see of Rome, exclusive of the Babylonish bishops presiding over the Nestorian community. The greatest diocese is that of the Bishop of Cochin, now residing at Coulak; the second is the Archbishop of Cranganore; and the third the bishop of Verapoly. Besides these there is a Babylonian or Syrian metropolitan, residing at Nannate, in the province of Travancor. Forty-four churches compose at present the Nestorian community, which contained above 200,000 souls before the arrival of Vasco de Gama, and is now reduced to about 40,000. The number of Christians on the whole Malabar Coast, including the Syrians or Nestorians, is computed to amount to rather more than 200,000, of whom about 90,000 are settled in the Travancor country. The number of Jews are estimated to exceed 30,000.\n\nThe first book printed on this coast was the Doctrina Christiana of Giovanni Gonsalvez, a lay brother of the order of the Jesuits, who first cast Tamulic characters in the year 1577. After this, in 1598, there appeared a book entitled the Elos Sanctorum, which was followed by the Tamulic Dictionary of Father Antonio de Proenca, printed in the year 1679 at Ambalacate, on this coast. The Hindoos of Malabar reckon by the era of Parasu Rama, and divide it into cycles of 1099 years; the year A.D. 1800 being reckoned to correspond with the 976th of the cycle. The characters used in Malabar are nearly the same with those used among the Tamuls of the Carnatic for writing poetry, and the poetic language of both races is nearly the same.\n\nThe whole foreign trade of this extensive province, both import and export, is with a few exceptions confined to Bombay, the Persian Gulf, and Gujrat. The imports consist of alum, assafoetida, cotton, piece goods, shawls, broad cloth, nankin, rice, sugar from Bengal and Bombay, coir and cocoa nuts from Travancor.\n\nThe exports are more numerous and extensive, and consist chiefly of coir, cocoa nuts, timber, rice, ghee, dry ginger, piece goods, cardamoms, pepper, sandal wood, sapan wood, turmeric, arrow root, betel nut, iron, &c. &c.\n\nThe total value of imports into this province during 1811, from places beyond the territories of the Madras government was Arcot rup. 721,040, viz.\n\n| From          | Value   |\n|---------------|---------|\n| Bengal        | 55,844  |\n| Bombay        | 438,935 |\n| Ceylon        | 8,610   |\n| China         | 5,630   |\n| Eastward      | 20,636  |\n| Goa           | 2,375   |\n| Gujrat        | 44,852  |\n| Maharatta country | 37,838 |\n| Mocha         | 1,233   |\n| Travaneor     | 10,248  |\n| Various places| 94,789  |\n\nArcot rupees 721,040\n\nThe total value of the exports to places beyond the limits of the Madras government, during 1811, was Arcot rupees 2,236,718, viz.\n\n| To            | Value   |\n|---------------|---------|\n| Calcutta      | 68,367  |\n| Bombay        | 1,510,713|\n| Ceylon        | 11,823  |\n| Eastward      | 25,792  |\n| Gujrat        | 206,119 |\n| London        | 1,687   |\n| Maharatta country | 39,275 |\n| Mocha         | 153,576 |\n| Muscat        | 59,800  |\n| Travaneor     | 51,532  |\n| Various places| 108,034 |\n\nArcot rupees 2,236,718\n\nBetween the 1st May, 1811, and the 30th April, 1812, 1,146 vessels and craft, measuring 71,796 tons, ar-\nriveted; and 469 vessels, measuring 55,268 tons, departed. (F. Buchan, Parliamentary Reports, Wilks, Dow, Duncan, Fra Paolo, &c.)\n\nMALABAR PROVINCE.\n\nA province on the west coast of India, situated between the 10th and 13th degrees of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by the Province of Canara; on the south by the Rajah of Cochin's territories; to the east it has the chain of high mountains named the Western Ghauts; and to the west the sea. In length it may be estimated at 155 miles, by 35 the average breadth.\n\nThis province may be divided into two portions. By far the most extensive consists of low hills separated by narrow valleys, and from the Ghauts this always extends a considerable distance to the westward, and sometimes even to the sea. The hills are seldom of any considerable height, but in general have steep sides and level summits. The sides possess the best soil, and are in many places formed into terraces. The summits in many places are bare, and especially towards the north expose to the view large surfaces of naked rock. The valleys contain, in general, rivulets that convey away the superfluous water; but in some places the level is not sufficient, and in the rainy season the ground is much overflowed. The soil in these valleys is extremely fertile.\n\nThe second portion of the Malabar province consists of a poor sandy soil, and is confined to the places on the sea-coast, seldom above three miles wide, and in general not so much. Near the low hills these plains are the most level, and best fitted for the cultivation of rice. Nearer the sea they are more unequal in their surface, and rise into low downs, admirably adapted for the cocoa nut tree. This division of the country is wonderfully intersected by inlets of the sea, which often run for great lengths parallel to the coast, receiving the various mountain streams, and communicating with the ocean by different narrow and shallow openings. In other places, where there are none of these salt inlets, the low land within the downs on the sea-coast is, in the rainy season, totally overflowed; for the fresh water has then no vent, and must therefore stagnate until it gradually evaporates. As it dries up it leaves the land fit for some particular kinds of rice; and it is probably owing to this cultivation, that the stagnate waters do not injure the salinity of the air; for Malabar, generally, may be esteemed a healthy country.\n\nIn this province the rivers and mountain streams are very numerous; but, on account of the vicinity of the Western Ghauts to the sea, their courses are very short. Few of the rivers have any peculiar appellation, but each portion is called after the most remarkable place near which it flows. In the Irmadu district gold dust is collected in the river which passes Nelambur; and is a branch of that which falls into the sea at Parapanada.\n\nThe forests in this country are private property, application being necessary to the landlord for permission to cut down any particular tree, which is not requisite in all parts of India. The teak tree grows mostly about Manarghaut, and is therefore too remote from a navigable river to be conveyed for sale to the sea-coast. The sandal wood is not the produce of Malabar; but, as the greater part of it grows immediately to the eastward of the Western Ghauts, all that is produced towards the sources of the Cavery ought to come to Malabar, as the nearest sea-coast from whence it can be exported. The sandal wood is of the best quality; but the few trees that are found within the limits of Malabar are totally devoid of smell. The palm, which in Malabar is called the brab (borasus),\nis in such immense quantities about Palighaut, that the jaggery prepared from it commonly sells at one fanam per tolam, or 2s. 7\u00bdd. per cent. With proper care an excellent spirit might be extracted from it.\n\nBlack pepper is the grand article of European export from Malabar, as they usually purchase about five-eighths of all produced, and carry it principally to Europe direct, or to Bombay and China; for which last market many articles, the produce of Malabar, are peculiarly suited. The remainder of the pepper is exported chiefly by the native traders to the Bay of Bengal, Surat, Cutch, Sind, and other countries in the north-west of India; and a considerable quantity goes to the Arabian merchants of Muscat, Mocha, Hodeida, and Aden. In 1810 the imports to Bengal from the Coast of Malabar and Bombay amounted to 391,565 sicca rupees, and the exports to the Coast of Malabar to 2,238,699 sicca rupees. On the Coast of Malabar, Canara, and west of India, the Company have custom-houses at Bombay, Mangalore, Tellicherry, Mahe, Calicut, Cochin, and Anjengo.\n\nMalabar, when invaded by Hyder, was a country very rich in the precious metals, the inhabitants having been, for ages, accumulating the gold and silver that had been given to them for the produce of their gardens. After its conquest, vast sums were extorted from the natives by the military officers, and by the Canarese Brahmins placed over the revenue. In the northern parts of Malabar the most common currency is a silver fanam, equal in value to one-fifth of a Bombay rupee. In the Vellater district are many forges for melting iron, which is done so imperfectly, that its cavities include many pieces of charcoal, enveloped by the iron. In this small district, also, there are a few remarkable spots of land watered by perennial streams, that annually produce three crops of rice.\n\nThe native breed of cattle and buffaloes in Malabar are of a very diminutive form, and are but little used in the transportation of goods, which are usually carried by porters. No horses, asses, swine, sheep, or goats, are bred in Malabar; at least the number is perfectly inconsiderable, all those required for the use of the inhabitants being imported from the eastward. The original natives had no poultry; but, since the Europeans have settled among them, the common fowl may be had in abundance. Geese, ducks, and turkeys are confined to the sea-coast, where they are reared by the Portuguese.\n\nThe villages in Malabar are the neatest in India, and are much embellished by the beauty and elegant dress of the Brahmin girls. The houses are placed contiguous in a straight line, and are built of mud, so as generally to occupy two sides of a square area, that is a little raised, and kept clean and free from grass. The mud is of an excellent quality, and, in general, is neatly smoothed, and either white-washed or painted; but the houses, being thatched with palm leaves, are extremely liable to fire. Both bazars and villages have been introduced by foreigners, the Nambouries, Nairs, and all the aboriginal natives of Malabar living in detached houses, surrounded with gardens, and collectively called Desas. These higher ranks use very little clothing, but are remarkably clean in their persons\u2014entaneous distempers being never observed, except among the slaves and the very lowest castes.\n\nIn the district about Palighaut by far the greater part of the labour in the field is performed by slaves. These are the absolute property of their lords, or devans. They are not attached to the soil, but may be sold or transferred in any manner a master think fit, except that a husband and wife cannot be sold separately; but children may be taken from their parents. These slaves are\nof different castes. They erect for themselves temporary huts, which are little better than large baskets. A young man and his wife will sell from 6l. 4s. to 7l. 8s.; two or three children will add 2l. 10s. to the value of the family. The slaves are very severely treated, and their diminutive stature, and squalid appearance, shew evidently a want of adequate nourishment. There can be no comparison of their condition with that of the slaves in the West Indies, except that, in Malabar, there are a sufficient number of females, who are allowed to marry any person of the same caste with themselves. The personal labour of the wife is always exacted by the husband's master, the master of the girl having no authority over her, so long as she lives with another man's slave. This is a practice that ought to be adopted by the West-India planters.\n\nThe southern and middle divisions of the Malabar Province are supposed to contain 3300 British square miles, with rather more than 100 inhabitants to the square mile; the total number of inhabitants probably exceeding 600,000. In 1800 the population of four districts, viz. Bettutanada, Parpanada on the sea-coast, and Vellater and Shirnada towards the Ghauts, was as follows:\n\n| Houses inhabited by Mahomedans | 12,581 |\n|-------------------------------|--------|\n| Do. by Nambourg Brahmins      | 297    |\n| Do. by Puttar Brahmins        | 44     |\n| Do. by the families of rajahs | 33     |\n| Do. by Nairs                  | 6,747  |\n| Do. by Tiars                  | 4,733  |\n| Do. by mneuas (fishermen)     | 608    |\n| Do. by people from the eastward | 472   |\n\nTotal 25,515\n\nInhabitants.\n\nContaining about 140,000\n\nNumber of male slaves 8,547\n\nFemale ditto 7,654\n\nTotal population 16,201\n\nThe Malabar Province, on its coming into the possession of the Company, in 1792, was annexed to the Bombay Presidency. It was then found to labour under all the evils which could be inflicted upon it by the hand of injustice and oppression; and the administration of its affairs, while it continued under the Bombay government, was not calculated to improve its condition. When first invaded by Hyder, in 1766, Malabar was governed by a race of rajahs, exercising, in their respective districts, an authority nearly independent\u2014the lands being mostly in the possession of the Nairs. The persecutions to which the rajahs and Nairs were subjected, during the Mahomedan rule of Hyder and Tippoo, but more particularly the latter, obliged them to seek refuge in other countries. The power and authority which they had possessed were transferred to the Moplays (Mahomedan), who consequently became the officers and instruments of government.\n\nOn the breaking out of the war between Tippoo and the British, in 1790, the rajahs and Nairs were leading a predatory life in the jungles, or were living in the Travancor province. They were allowed to join the British army, but the war was terminated without their assistance. The Bombay government immediately reinstated the rajahs and Nairs in their former possessions, and made a settlement with them for the revenues; but they failed to fulfil their engagements in three successive settlements, and their mode of government was besides found such as could not be tolerated or protected consistent with humanity. They were, in consequence, deprived of all authority, and allowed one-fifth of their countries' revenue to support their dignity; which is more than any sovereign of consequence in Europe can spare for that purpose. They were, nevertheless, dissatisfied, became refractory, and at\nlast hoisted the standard of rebellion; thereby creating a confusion which could only be subdued by a military force. In this state of affairs the Bengal government ordered the transfer of the province to the Madras Presidency, and it was committed to the management of a military officer, having three subordinate collectors.\n\nSince this period a great improvement has taken place in the condition of this province, and it now exhibits a scene of public tranquillity and progressive opulence, which would appear, in a great degree, attributable to the judicious local arrangements of Mr. Warden, the collector, who was appointed to that important situation in 1803, and discharged the duties of it for eight years. In 1807 the revenue produced by this province was six lacs and a half of star pagodas, and it was on the increase. It had been realized without difficulty, and was produced by indirect taxation; the land revenues being light, in comparison with the rest of the south of India. Besides the province, the collectorship of Malabar includes the Wynad, and some small districts above the Western Ghauts. (F. Buchanan, 5th Report, Fr. Paloli, Duncan, Falconer, &c.)\n\nMalabar Point.\u2014A remarkable promontory on the island of Bombay, where there is a cleft of rock of considerable sanctity, to which numerous Hindu pilgrims resort for the purpose of regeneration, which is effected by passing through the aperture. This hole is of considerable elevation, situated among rocks of difficult access, and, in the stormy season, incessantly lashed by the surf of the ocean. Near to it are the ruins of a temple, which is reported; with great probability, to have been blown up by the idol-hating Portuguese.\n\nIn the neighbourhood is a beautiful Brahmin village, built round a fine tank of considerable extent, with broad flights of steps down to the water. Brahmins are here found leading the lives most agreeable to them. The ceremonies of religion comprise the business of their lives; and a literary and contemplative indolence forms their negative pleasure. Some of them are said to have lived here to an old age, without once visiting the contiguous town of Bombay. Wealthy and devout Hindoos pay occasional visits to these philosophers, and derive profit and consolation from their sage counsels. Near to this village is a temple of Lakshmi (the goddess of plenty), much resorted to by pilgrims and pious persons, who have the additional benefit of optional regeneration offered, in the passage through the venerated type above described. (Moor, &c.)\n\nMALACCA, (Malaka).\n\nA peninsula situated at the southern extremity of India, beyond the Ganges, and extending from the first to the 11th degree of north latitude. The isthmus of Kraw, about 97 miles in breadth, connects it to the north with the province of Tenasserim; on all the other sides it is bounded by the Eastern Ocean. In length it may be estimated at 775 miles, by 125 the average breadth.\n\nThis nearly insulated region consists of a long narrow strip of land, almost covered by a deep and impenetrable forest. A range of extremely bleak mountains runs through it from one extremity to the other, giving rise to innumerable streams, which fall into the sea on each side, so that the country is well supplied with water. The principal modern subdivisions of the peninsula are the isthmus of Kraw, Queda, Pera, Salengore, Malacca, Rumbo, Johore, Tringano, Packanga, and Patany; and at the southern extremity are the islands of Bintang, Batang, and Sincapoor, with many others, so thickly clustered together, that they seem a prolongation of the main land, being only separated by narrow\nstraits. The west coast is also studded with numerous islands, and, among the rest, Pulo Penang, or Prince of Wales's Island; but on the eastern side the sea is more open and less interrupted.\n\nLike other Malay countries, the coast is well covered with wood, and exhibits a great extent of verdure; but, as far as is yet known, the teak-tree is thought to be a stranger. As, in many parts of the east, the jungles, from their density and great luxuriance, are unfavourable to the production of animals, game, in consequence, is difficult to be procured. The soil is not remarkable for its fertility, but the seas and rivers afford an abundant supply of fish. The rivers, on account of the bars and sandbanks at their mouths, are only navigable for vessels of small burden. Ships returning to Calcutta from their voyage eastward frequently call at Salengore, Prince of Wales's Island, and Queda, to collect tin, pepper, betel-nut, wax, elephants' teeth, and rattans\u2014articles of export; the grand import consists of opium: but for further commercial and local details, the reader is referred to the different subdivisions specified; what follows being principally applicable to the Malay nation generally.\n\nThe peninsula is at present inhabited by various distinct races of people. Until recently the Siamese possessed the northern part to Lat. 7\u00b0, extending across, and the Malay states of Quechah, Patany, Thin-ganno, and Taekauag, are still tributary to that kingdom; the power of which, however, has been greatly reduced by the Burmans. The Malays possess the whole of the sea coast from that latitude to Point Romanaia, being mixed in some places with the Buggesses from Celebes, who have still a small settlement at Salengore. The inland parts to the northward are inhabited by the Patany people, who appear to be a mixture of Siamese and Malays, and occupy independent villages. The Menancabow people on the Peninsula are so named from an inland country in Sumatra; a distinction being made between them and the Malays of Johore, although none is perceptible.\n\nAmong the aboriginal natives are the oriental negroes, who inhabit the interior. Though of a more diminutive stature, they have the woolly hair, the jetty black skin, the thick lip, and flat nose, which characterize the African. By the Malays they are named Samangs, and they are distinguished into the Samangs of the lower lands; who, from their vicinity to the Malays, have borrowed some slender portion of civilization, and the Samangs of the mountains, who are represented as being in the lowest stage of savage existence. The first have fixed habitations, plant a small quantity of rice, and barter with the Malays for food or cloths, the resin, bees' wax, and honey of their forests. The last present the genuine picture of the hunter's life, and are divided into petty communities, perpetually at variance. They go entirely naked, and are said to have no fixed habitations, wandering through the thick forests in quest of roots and game, and taking shelter from the weather under the first tree or thicket. Their language differs much from that of the Malays, who describe it as a mere jargon, which can only be compared to the chattering of large birds.\n\nThe Malays are named Khek by the Siamese, and Masu by the Birmanians. Their language, which contains a great number of Sanscrit, many Arabic, and even some Portuguese words, has from its sweetness been termed the Italian, and from its general diffusion the Hindostany, or lingua franca of the east. As a spoken language it exists in its greatest purity in the states of Quechah, Tamiassay, Pera, Salengore, Kil-lung, Johore, Tringano, Pahang, and as far as Patany, where it meets the Siamese. The Malay is generally\nemployed in the districts bordering on the sea coast, and the mouths and banks of navigable rivers, being the medium of commercial and foreign intercourse; but it has obtained no footing in the interior of the Indian continent. That the Malay language has acquired this extensive currency, is attributable to the commercial and enterprising character of the people; who, either by force of arms, or in the spirit of mercantile speculation, have established themselves in every part of the Archipelago; and also to the valuable qualities of the language, which is remarkably soft and easy of pronunciation, and simple in the grammatical relation of its words. The character generally used is a modification of the Arabic, to which they add six other letters. The Malay spoken at the Island of Tidore, when visited in 1521 by Peggabutta, the companion of Magellan, accords exactly with the Malay of the present day; which proves that no material alteration has taken place in the tongue, during the lapse of three centuries.\n\nThe great sources of all the Malay poetical legends are the Javanese, the Keling (spoken on the west side of the Bay of Bengal), and the Arabic languages. The Malayan literature consists chiefly of transcripts and versions of the Koran, commentaries on the Mahommedan law, and historic tales in prose and verse. Many of these are original compositions, and others are translations of the popular tales current in Arabia, Persia, India, and the neighbouring Island of Java. There are also many compositions of a historical nature. One of this description, termed the Hikarat Malacca, relates the founding of that city by a Javanese adventurer, the arrival of the Portuguese, and the combats of the Malays with Albuquerque, and the other Portuguese commanders.\n\nWith respect to the religion possessed by the Malayan princes, prior to their conversion to the Mahommedan, little is known; but it was probably some modification of the Hindoo religion, much corrupted and blended with the antecedent idolatry of the country where they originated. Prior to their conversion, they do not appear to have had an era, with which Hindoos are generally amply provided; and they appear also to have been ignorant of the ordinary division of time, into days, weeks, and years; a division well known to their civilized neighbours, the Javanese. Even now, however, the more enlightened of them are seldom able to tell their own age, or the year of their birth. The modern Malays are of the Sooni Mahommedan sect, but do not possess much of the bigotry so common among the western followers of Mahommed. Men of rank have their religious periods, during which they scrupulously attend to their duties, and refrain from gratifications of the appetite, together with gambling and cock-fighting; but these intervals are neither long nor frequent.\n\nThe Malay governments are of the rudest construction, and founded on principles nearly feudal. The head of the state is a rajah, who usually assumes the title of sultan, introduced by the Arabsians; and under him are a certain number of dattoos or nobles, who have a train of subordinate vassals. In general, however, the king is but little obeyed by the chiefs, or the latter by the people, than according to their inclination. Violent acts of immediate power are committed both by the chiefs and their superior, but there is no regular system of obedience. The presumptive heir is in all states named the rajah mudo, or young rajah; and with the institution of dattoos appears peculiar to this nation. The free Malays are an intelligent, active, industrious body of men, engaged like the Chinese in trade and foreign commerce. Many of their praws are very fine vessels, and navigated with consi-\nderable skill; but the Malay sailor, although strong and occasionally active, is by no means perseveringly so; and, during extreme cold or bad weather, is found to scull sooner than the more feeble but docile Bengal lascar.\n\nThe distinct character of the Malay is certainly of a very extraordinary nature, and exhibits a striking contrast to the mild and timid Bengally. In their pursuit of plunder the Malays are active, restless, and courageous, as in their conquests they are ferocious and vindictive. To their enemies they are remorseless, to their friends capricious, and to strangers treacherous. The courage of the Malay may be considered of that furious and desperate kind, that acts on the impulse of the moment, rather than that steady and deliberate conduct that preserves its character under all circumstances. It is equally dangerous to offend or punish a Malay: in the one case he will stab privately; in the other, in the heat of his rage. By the same impetuous temper that renders him impatient of injuries he is driven to desperation by misfortunes, whether they arise from unavoidable circumstances, or from his own misconduct. In either case he rarely submits to his fate with coolness, but flies to his favourite opium, to prepare him for the commission of the desperate act he meditates. Animated to a frenzy he lets loose his long black hair, draws his deadly creese, and rushes into the streets, determined to do all the mischief he can during the short time he has to live. This is what is usually called running a muck (from his calling amok, amok\u2014kill, kill), and seldom happens in a British settlement; but were very frequent among the Dutch, who were notorious for the fiend-like cruelty of their punishments. An unfortunate propensity to gambling is one of the chief causes that drives the Malay to this state of desperation. So passionately attached is he to every species of gaming, and more particularly of cock-fighting, that his last morsel, the covering of his body, his wife and children, are frequently staked on the issue of a battle to be fought by his favourite cock.\n\nThe superiority of the European naval power in the Eastern Seas, has tended very much to repress the piracies and depredations of the Malays, who are certainly no longer the bold and enterprising race of Buccaneers they are represented to have been. The authority of law and justice, however, is but imperfectly established; trading vessels visiting their ports must still be armed, and notwithstanding every precaution are frequently cut off, and their crews murdered, with circumstances of singular atrocity. The population along the Malay coasts does not appear on the increase, nor are the marriages prolific. It has been asserted from good authority, that under favourable circumstances, the average number of living children to a marriage is highly rated at two.\n\nIt appears from evidence as positive as the nature of the subject will admit, that the present possessors of the coast of the Malay Peninsula were, in the first instance, adventurers from Sumatra; who, in the 12th century, formed an establishment there; and that the indigenous inhabitants were gradually driven by them to the rocks and mountains, and are entirely a different race of men.\n\nThe original country inhabited by the Malayan race, according to the best authorities, was the kingdom of Palembang in the Island of Sumatra, on the banks of the River Malaya, from whence they migrated about A.D. 1160, to the south eastern extremity of the opposite peninsula, where they first built the city of Sinapoor, and afterwards, about A.D. 1252, founded that of Malacca. Up to A.D. 1276, the Malayan princes were pagans. Sultan Mahomed Shah, who at that era ascended the throne, was the first Mahommedan prince, and by the propagation of\nthis faith acquired great celebrity during a long reign of 57 years. His influence appears to have extended over the neighbouring islands of Lingen and Bintang, together with Johore, Patany, Quedah, and Pera, on the coasts of the peninsula, and Campar and Aru in Sumatra\u2014all of which acquired the appellation of Malayu.\n\nDuring part of the 15th century, Malacca appears to have been in subjection to the Siamese sovereigns. Sultan Mahmood Shah was the 12th Malayan King, and seventh king of Malacca city. In A.D. 1509 he repelled the aggression of the King of Siam; but, in 1511, was conquered by the Portuguese under Alphonso D'Albuquerque, and compelled with the principal inhabitants to fly to the extremity of the peninsula, where he founded the city of Johore, which still subsists. (Marsden, Edinburgh Review, Leyden, Quarterly Review, Elmore, &c. &c.)\n\nMalacca.\u2014A town in the straits of the same name, situated near the southern extremity of the Malay Peninsula. Lat. 2\u00b0. 14'. N. Long. 102\u00b0. 12'. E.\n\nThe roads here are safe, but the entrance of the river is rendered intricate by a bar, over which boats cannot pass before quarter flood, nor after last quarter ebb, without much difficulty. Under the lee of the island, nearest to the fort, there is a harbour where, in the S.W. monsoon, vessels not drawing more than 16 feet water may be secured. The houses in the town are tolerably well built, with broad and straight streets, but that part of it inhabited by the natives is composed of bamboo and mat huts. On the southern side of the river are the remaining walls of a fort, in a most ruinous condition. A few guns are ranged along a little above the fort, which serves as a saluting battery. On the summit of this mount stands an old Portuguese chapel, built in the 16th century, but now in a state of dilapidation.\n\nThe country around Malacca, for eight or 10 miles in circumference, is pleasant and productive; and, although so near the equator, the heat of the climate is moderate\u2014it being refreshed by a succession of land and sea breezes. The rising grounds in the vicinity are barren and rocky, and have been used by the Chinese as places of sepulture; most of the cultivators, distillers, sugar makers, and farmers of the customs, being of that industrious nation. The vallies produce rice and sugar, which might be much increased under a better government.\n\nConsiderable supplies of grain are imported to Malacca from Bengal, Java, and Sumatra; but abundance of fruits and vegetables may be procured here, particularly yams and potatoes among the roots, and the mangosteen among the fruits. Sheep and bullocks are scarce, but there are buffaloes, hogs, poultry, and fish, in great plenty, and at moderate prices. The trade of this place was extensive until superseded by Prince of Wales's Island, both as a place of commerce and refreshment. The export trade principally consisted of all the produce of the straits and eastern ports, such as tin, pepper, biche de mar, sago, rattans, canes, elephants' teeth, and some gold dust. The country ships from Calcutta to the Malay coast with opium, piece goods, raw and China silks, and dollars, ballast with rice; which, if they do not dispose of at Junkceylon, or Prince of Wales's Island, they sell here, and take in ballast. During the Dutch government this was a great market for piece goods, but the opium was bought on the Dutch East India Company's account by the governor, who with the fiscal and shahbunder, were the principal merchants. Occasionally a few chests of opium were smuggled on shore by private merchants, and spars for moderate-sized vessels might be procured.\n\nA.D. 1252, Sri Iscander Shah, the last King of Sincapoor, being hard pressed by the forces of the King of\nMajapahit in Java, retired first to the northward, and afterwards to the westward, where he founded a new city, to which he gave the name of Malacea. It was first visited, in 1508, by the Portuguese, and, in 1511, captured by them after an obstinate resistance. In their possession it remained until 1640, during which interval it was repeatedly attacked by the kings of Acheen, who were with the utmost difficulty prevented from effecting its conquest. In 1640 it was assailed by the Dutch and taken, after a siege of six months. With them it remained until 1795, when it was seized on by the English, but restored at the peace of Amiens. It was again recaptured by the British, with whom it still continues, and part of the walls blown up in 1807, at which time the revenues produced 80,000 dollars per annum.\n\nThe territorial possessions of the Dutch in this vicinity, according to the Transactions of the Batavian Society, are the mountains of Rumbo, inhabited by a Malay people named Maning Cabou (Menanacabow), and Mount Ophir, called by the natives Gunong Ledang. These limits they say are impracticable for a European to pass\u2014the whole coast for some leagues from the sea being either a morass or impenetrable forest; these natural difficulties being aggravated by the treacherous and sanguinary character of the natives. (Marsden, Elmore, Johnson, Howison, &c. &c.)\n\nMalativoe.\u2014A small town in the Island of Ceylon. Lat. 9\u00b0. 17'. N. Long. 81\u00b0. 7'. E.\n\nThis place is uncommonly well situated close to a small river which runs past the fort, and when it joins the sea forms a harbour sufficient to admit small craft. The principal employment of the inhabitants is fishing, and from hence the garrison at Trincomalee is supplied with this article. Cattle and poultry are here also cheap and abundant. In the woods wild hogs and deer are so plentiful, that for a little powder and shot a native will undertake to procure game, and ask no further pay. (Percival, &c.)\n\nMalda, (Malada).\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Rajemal, 56 miles N. by W. from Moorshedabad. Lat. 25\u00b0. 3'. N. Long. 88\u00b0. 4'. E.\n\nThis place is situated on a river which communicates with the Ganges, from which the town is not far removed. It arose out of the ruins of Gour, the ancient capital of Bengal; is a place of great trade, and produces much silk, which is the staple commodity of the country. The weaving of mixed goods made with silk and cotton also flourishes in this neighbourhood, for the purchase of which and of silk, the East India Company have for a long time had a commercial resident and establishment settled here. (Rennel, Colebrooke, &c.)\n\nMaldives Islands, (Malaya Dwi-pa, the Isles of Malaya).\u2014These islands extend from the eighth degree of north latitude to the equinoctial line, and are divided into 17 clusters called Atollons. These groups are most of them round, but some are oval, and lie in a row in a N. W. and S. E. direction, separated from each other by narrow channels, not navigable by ships of burthen. Each of these clusters is surrounded by rocks, that defend them from the sea, which here rages with great fury. The large islands are inhabited and cultivated, but a great proportion of the chain consists of mere rocks, rocky shoals, and sand banks, flooded at spring tides. They have never been completely explored, although so near to the course of ships outward bound to Bengal; but their size is known to be very small, and their number very great.\n\nA great trade is carried on among these clusters, each of them having something peculiar to itself; the weavers residing in one, the goldsmiths in another; the locksmiths, matmakers, potters, turners, joiners;\neach inhabiting distinct groups of islands. The different traders go from island to island in boats with a small deck, and sometimes are a year absent from their own island. On these occasions they generally live in their boats, and carry their male children of four or five years of age with them, to accustom them to a sea life.\n\nSome years back one or two vessels used to visit the Maldives from the British settlements to load cowries, but from the delay they experienced, and the unhealthiness of the climate, this trade has for some time been abandoned by Europeans. It is now principally carried on by the Maldivians in their own boats, constructed of the trunks of cocoa nut trees. These arrive at Balasore in Orissa, situated at the mouth of the Calcutta River, in the months of June and July, (when the S. W. monsoon is steady in the Bay of Bengal), loaded with coir, (the fibres of the cocoa nut), cocoa nut oil, and all the other produce of the cocoa nut tree, their grand staple, cowries, salt fish, turtle shell, &c. &c. They sail about the middle of December, during the N. E. monsoons, with their returns; more than half of which consists of rice from Bengal, the granary of the Indies, the rest is sugar, hardware, broad cloth, cutlery, silk stuffs, coarse cottons, tobacco, &c. The imports to Bengal, in 1810, averaged about 184,129 sicca rupees, and the exports 90,182 sicca rupees. Many Maldivian boats come annually to Acheen, and bring dried bonetto in small pieces, about two or three ounces weight, which when cured is as hard as horn in the centre. Ships occasionally resort to the Maldives to procure dried shark fins for the China market, being esteemed by that nation as an excellent seasoning for soup, and highly invigorating.\n\nThe Maldivians profess the Mahomedan religion, yet in some of their customs resemble the Boadjoos of Borneo. They annually launch a small vessel loaded with perfumes, gums, and odoriferous flowers, and turn it adrift at the mercy of the winds and waves, as an offering to the spirit of the winds; and sometimes similar offerings are made to the spirit whom they term King of the Sea. With their internal government we are little acquainted, but it does not appear, that although separated into distinct islands and groups of islands, that they engage in war with each other, which is wholly unaccountable. They are described as a mild inoffensive race, and very hospitable. In 1777 a French vessel, with some ladies of rank, was wrecked on the Island of Yinetay, who met with the kindest treatment from the chief and his subjects. The French East India Company had formerly a corporal and some soldiers resident on these islands, but they were removed by M. Lally in 1759. When Hyder invaded Malabar, in 1766, he contemplated the conquest of these islands also, but never carried his intention into execution.

E.\n\nThis is a large mud fort, separated into two portions by a transverse wall, and was given as a jaghire with the adjacent country to Tippoo by his father Hyder. About two miles S. W. from Malavilly is a large re-\nservoir, where, during the last war, Tipoo had an action with General Harris, in which he was defeated. After the battle he sent and destroyed this place, but above 500 houses have since been rebuilt. Near to this town iron ore is smelted, from whence Seringapatam receives its chief supply. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nMALLIA.\u2014A town and fortress in the province of Gujrat, situated on the River Muchoo, which having passed Wankancer in the interior, empties itself into the Run two and a half miles below this place. The surrounding country is low, and slopes off towards the Run; in the rainy season it is a marsh for many miles.\n\nPrior to 1809 this fortress was possessed by a band of notorious plunderers, who had gained such an ascendancy over the neighbouring country, that they committed the most atrocious acts of cruelty and oppression with impunity. Many efforts had been made by the neighbouring chieftains to extirpate them, but all their endeavours were unavailing, and only increased the reputation of the robbers, whose strong hold came to be considered as impregnable. In 1809 it was attacked by a Bombay detachment under Col. Walker, and the town stormed in open day in the presence of the native chiefs, a few hours after the batteries were opened. The effect was such that the upper fort was evacuated during the night, and the few depredators, who had escaped the storm, took refuge across the Run in the province of Cutch. Before this event the villages had been deserted, and the country around Mallia depopulated for many miles.\u2014(Macmurdo, 11th Register, &c.)\n\nMALLOODOO.\u2014A district in the north-eastern extremity of Borneo, and in many respects the most valuable which that large island contains. Numerous rivers fall into the Bay of Malloodoo, which is reported to have good soundings throughout the whole of it. This district is populous, and well supplied with food, which is a rare case in Borneo. Rattans of an excellent quality, from 10 to 20 feet long, may here be procured, and also clove bark.\n\nThe natives on the sea coast assert, that in the interior there is a lake named Kenneyballoo, which appears from their description to exceed in magnitude that of Manilla, and to contain many islands. It is said to be five or six fathoms deep in some places, and to be the source of many rivers. Around its margin are many hamlets inhabited by the Idaan or Horaforas, but from their want of foreign communication, and the peculiarity of their customs, they are little addicted to commerce. (Dalrymple, &c.)\n\nMALNORE.\u2014A town in the Seik territories, in the province of Delhi, 160 miles N. W. by N. from the city of Delhi. Lat. 30\u00b0. 22'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 18'. E.\n\nMALLUVER.\u2014A village in the province of Gundwana, the residence of a Goand chief, 12 miles south from Kuttunpoor. Lat. 20\u00b0. 34'. N. Long. 82\u00b0. 50'. E. From Bonslagur to this place, a distance of 50 miles, the road is through a country which is one continued wilderness. In this neighbourhood there is a small subacid plum of a very pleasant taste, which grows wild. (Bhout, &c.)\n\nMALOOR.\u2014A town in the Mysore Rajah's territories, 27 miles E. by N. from Bangaloor. Lat. 13\u00b0. Long. 78\u00b0. 9'. E.\n\nMALPOORAH.\u2014A small town in the Seik territories, in the province of Lahore, 105 miles E. S. E. from the city of Lahore. Lat. 31\u00b0. 26'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 45'. E.\n\nMALTOWN.\u2014A town in the province of Allahabad, district of Bundelcund, 80 miles S. W. from Chattepoor. Lat. 24\u00b0. 19'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 46'. E. This place is situated near the hills, which separate Bundelcund from Malwah, and is a large village with a stone fort.\n\nMALWAN, (Malava).\u2014A large province in Hindostan, situated\nprincipally between the 22d and 23d degrees of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by Ajmeer and Agra; on the south by Khandesh and Berar; to the east it has Allahabad and Gondwana; and on the west Ajmeer and Gujrat. In length it may be estimated at 250 miles, by 150 miles the average breadth. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, this province is described as follows:\n\n\"The soubah of Malwah is situated in the second climate. The length from Currah to Banswarach, comprises 245 coss, and the breadth from Chandery to Nudderbar includes 230 coss. It is bounded on the east by Bandhoo; on the north by Narwar and the mountains; on the south by Boglaneh (Baglana); and on the west by Gujrat and Ajmeer. The rivers Nerbuddah, Soopra, Calysind, Neem, and Lowdy, flow through this soubah. The situation of this soubah, compared with other parts of Hindostan, is high. Both harvests are very good. Wheat, poppies, mangoes, musk, melons, and grapes, are here in high perfection. This soubah is divided into the following districts; viz. 1. Oojain; 2. Roysain; 3. Gurrah; 4. Chendary; 5. Sarangpoor; 6. Beejagur; 7. Mendow; 8. Hindia; 9. Nuzerbar; 10. Memsoor; 11. Gayroon; 12. Kowtry Beranch. These districts are subdivided into 301 pergunnahs, and contain 280,816 cavalry, 68,000 infantry, and 90 elephants.\"\n\nFrom the above delineation it appears, that when the Institutes of Achber were composed, the province of Malwah extended to the south of the Nerbuddah; and an angle touched on Baglana on the southwest, and Berar on the east. The rest of the southern boundary was formed by the Nerbuddah; but it is difficult to reconcile this arrangement with the position of the province of Khandesh. On the northeast this province is separated from the district of Harowty in Ajmeer by a ridge of mountains, extending east and west near the village of Muckundra. Lat. 24\u00b0. 48'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 12'. E.\n\nMalwah is probably the most elevated region in Hindostan, for from hence the rivers descend in every direction; but, although higher than the adjacent countries, the land is extremely fertile, the soil being generally a black vegetable mould, producing cotton, opium, indigo, tobacco, and grain in large quantities, besides furnishing pasture for numerous flocks of cattle. The harvest in this province as in Hindostan generally, is divided into two periods, the one being cut in September and October, and the other in March and April. Rice is cultivated only on a few detached spots, which lie convenient for water; but the quantity is so small, that it can hardly be reckoned among the crops. Barley is not cultivated, the soil being unfavourable for that species of grain. From its elevation, this territory enjoys a temperature of climate, favourable to the production of many species of fruits, which are destroyed by the heat of the lower provinces.\n\nThe principal articles of export are cottons, which are sent in large quantities to Gujrat, coarse stained and printed cloths, the root of the morinda, citrifolia, and opium. All the last at the time of gathering is adulterated with oil, and frequently with other substances, and is on the whole a very inferior article to the Bengal opium. The Malwah tobacco, particularly that of the Bilsah district, is beyond all comparison the best in India, and much sought after by the votaries of the hookah. It is surprising that the eager demand and high price have never influenced the natives to increase the cultivation materially; but they prefer substituting tobacco of a different growth, and asserting that it is the genuine Bilsah, relying on the ignorance and want of taste of their customers.\n\nMalwah contains the sources of\nnumerous rivers, but none attain to any great magnitude until they leave its limits. They are the Ner-buddah, Chumbul, Betwah, Sinde, Sopra, Mahy, and Cane. The principal towns are Oojain, Indore, Munda, Bopal, Bilsah, Seronge, Teavy, Koorwey, Khemlasa, Munda, and Shujawulpoo.\n\nThis province was invaded early in the 13th century by the Patan sovereigns of Delhi, and was wholly conquered or rendered tributary. Its subjection to that empire continued very precarious until the 14th and 15th centuries, during which period it was governed by independent sovereigns of the Patan or Afghan race, whose capital was Mandow (Munda), situated among the Vindhaya Mountains. After the conquest of Delhi by the Mogul dynasty, Malwah was soon subdued, and continued to form a province of that empire until the death of Aurengzebe, in 1707, when it was invaded and overrun by the Maharattas; and finally separated from the Mogul government about the year 1732, during the reign of Sahoo Rajah, and with this nation it has remained ever since.\n\nAt present a large proportion of Malwah is possessed by the Sindia family, but agreeably to a Maharatta custom, so intermixed with the territories of the Peshwa Holkar, and other chiefs, that it is difficult to discriminate them. The ancient landholders who were deprived of their possessions by the Maharattas, still retain some forts dispersed over the province, and partly by treaty, partly by force, receive a portion of the rents from the neighbouring villages. These people are called Grassiah, and in 1790 during the life time of Madhajee Sindia, one of them possessed a mud fort within ten miles of Oojain. These people are generally freebooters, and levy contributions by force during any confusion or distress of government.\n\nBesides the Grassiah, a great number of petty chiefs hold hereditary possession of districts, for which they pay the revenue to Sindia; and while this part of their engagement is performed, are little interfered with the internal management of their territories. Each of these chieftains possesses one or more strong holds, with which the province abounds; their subjugation, therefore, when refractory, is attended with considerable difficulty and expense; and they frequently make it a point of honour to withhold their revenue until the payment is compelled by force. (Hunter, Rennel, Scott, Marquis Wellesley, &c.)\n\nMalpurba, (Malayaparva).\u2014A small river in the south of India, which, after a short course, falls into the Krishna, and with that river may be considered as the northern boundary towards the Deccan.\n\nMalown, (or Malwan).\u2014A seaport town in the Maharatta territories, province of Bejapoor, and formerly famous as a resort of pirates, named from it Malwans. Lat. 16\u00b0. 4'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 26'. E.\n\nMampava.\u2014A town situated on the west coast of Borneo. Lat. 0\u00b0. 21'. N. Long. 109\u00b0. 10'. E. This is one of the best markets among the Eastern Islands for opium; the consumption, including its dependencies, being equal to 500 chests per annum. (Elmore, &c.)\n\nManaar.\u2014An island situated off the north-west coast of Ceylon, from which it is separated by an arm of the sea about two miles broad, which at low water is almost dry, with the exception of a small channel in the middle, not exceeding 30 or 40 yards broad. The passage from Manaar to Ramisseram is about 12 leagues; but it is interrupted by a line of sand banks, which runs quite across, and is known by the name of Adam's Bridge. Small boats ply between Ramisseram and Manaar, and government have also boats stationed for conveying over the letter bags between Ceylon and the continent. From Madras to Columbo the dist-\nance is 500 miles, and the letters are generally conveyed betwixt them in 10 days; but an express is sometimes carried in eight days.\n\nThe Dutch built a fort on the Island of Manaar, with a view to command the passage; and a garrison is still maintained here, which is augmented during the pearl fishing season. In length the island may be estimated at 15 miles, by three the average breadth. Manaar is a Tamul word, and signifies a sandy river, from the shallowness of the sea at this place. To the south of this island, towards Arippo, the coast of Ceylon is wild and barren, and destitute of accommodation and provisions. (Percival, Lubeck, &c.)\n\nManaar, (Gulf of).\u2014This gulf separates the Island of Ceylon from the Southern Carnatic. Although too shallow to admit vessels of a large size, the depth of water is sufficient for sloops, dories, and country craft of various descriptions, which convey goods by this passage, from Madras and other places on the Coromandel coast, to Columbo, instead of taking the outward circuitous passage, and rounding the island by Trincomalee Point de Galle, and Dondrahead. The ridge of sand banks, named Adam's Bridge, frequently presents an insurmountable obstruction, and vessels are obliged to lighten at Manaar before they can perform the passage. This is called the Inner or Palk's Passage, from a Dutchman of that name, who first attempted it. It is common to have large boats stationed at Manaar, to receive the goods and convey them forward to Columbo. Coarse cloths and calicoes are the chief goods imported by this route; and areka, cocoa nuts, betel leaf, fruits, arrack, and coir, are sent in return. (Percival, &c.)\n\nManapar, (Manapara).\u2014A town situated on a promontory, in the province of Tinnevelly, 60 miles N.E. from Cape Comorin. Lat. 8\u00b0. 39'. Long. 78\u00b0. 17'. E.\n\nManapar.\u2014A town in the Polygar territory, 50 miles W. by S. from Tanjore. Lat. 10\u00b0. 39'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 30'. E. This was formerly the residence of a tributary and refractory polygar; but is now, with the surrounding district, comprehended in the Dindigul collectorship.\n\nManaswary.\u2014A small island about five miles in circumference, situated in the harbour of Dory, or the great Island of Papua. Lat. 0\u00b0. 54'. N. Long. 134\u00b0. 40'. E. Here are many nutmeg trees growing wild, which produce nutmegs of the long species, but of inferior quality. (Forrest, &c.)\n\nManah.\u2014A town in Northern Hindostan, in the province of Serinagur, of which it forms the boundary in the N.E. quarter. Lat. 30\u00b0. 45'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 40'. E.\n\nThis town is built in three divisions, containing 150 or 200 houses, and is more populous than any place in this neighbourhood. The number of inhabitants is computed at 14 or 1500, who appear to be of a different race from the mountaineers of Gerwal or Serinagur. They are above middling size, stout, well formed, and their countenances more like the Tartars or Bootaners. They have broad faces, small eyes, and complexions of a light olive colour. The women are in general handsome, and have a ruddiness of complexion almost approaching to the floridness of Europeans. Their necks, ears, and noses, are covered with a profusion of rings, and various ornaments of beads and trinkets of gold and silver.\n\nThe houses are two stories high, constructed of stone, and covered with small deal plank, instead of slate. These may be considered only as their summer residences; for in the winter season the town is entirely buried under snow\u2014the population being compelled to migrate to a less rigorous climate. The villages of Josimath, Pancheser, and their vicinity, afford them an asylum for the four inclement months of the year. After the first fall of snow they retire from this place with their families,\ncarrying all their property with them, excepting the grain, which they bury in small pits. They profess the Hindu Brahminical doctrines, and call themselves Rajpoots. Like other inhabitants of cold climates, they are much addicted to drinking\u2014their beverage being a spirit extracted from rice, prepared in the usual mode of distillation.\n\nA considerable trade is carried on from hence with Bootan. Towards the end of July, when the snow has melted, these people set off in parties of from 100 to 150, with merchandise, principally laden upon sheep and goats. The principal articles imported from Bootan are salt, saffron, borax, zedoary, dried grapes, gold dust in small bags, cow tails, and musk in pods, blankets, inferior cow tails, and bezoar. A few articles of porcelain are also brought down, and also a small quantity of tea, but the demand for both is trifling. Hill ponies, sheep with four and six horns, and the Chowry cow, are also brought from those transalpine regions, and are to be seen grazing in the neighbourhood of Mahanah. Dogs, of a species as large as the Newfoundland breed, are also imported. (Raper, &c.)\n\nMancote, (Manucota).\u2014A village in the province of Lahore, 74 miles N. E. from the city of Lahore. Lat. 32\u00b0.44'. N. Long. 74\u00b0.28'. E. This place stands on an eminence skirted by a small river, and in 1783 was tributary to the Rajah of Jamboce, but is now possessed by the Seiks.\n\nMandhar.\u2014A district in the Island of Celebes, bounded on the west by the Straits of Macassar, and on the east by a tract of desert mountains, to which the inhabitants retire when attacked from the sea by enemies too powerful to resist in the field. The government of this small state was formerly vested in 10 nobles, who were in subjection to the Macassars before the latter were subdued by the Dutch. The name is celebrated in Hindoo mythology, as that of the mountain with which the demi-gods and demons churned the ocean to procure the essence of immortality.\n\nMandoly Isle.\u2014One of the Gilolo Islands, situated between the 1st and 2d degrees of south latitude, and about the 127th of east longitude. In length it may be estimated at 20 miles, by four the average breadth.\n\nMandow, (Mandu).\u2014A district in the province of Malwah, situated among the Vindhaya Mountains, between the 22d and 23d degrees of north latitude, and at present subject to the Maharattas, but much infested by tribes of freebooters of the Bhcel caste. The Nerbuddah, which bounds this district to the south, is the principal and almost the only river, the face of the country being generally mountainous; but the valleys are fertilized by numerous streams from the hills. On account of the defective state of the government this territory is greatly covered with jungle, and very thinly inhabited. The chief towns are Munda, Bajulpore, and Dectan. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Mandow, containing 16 mahals; measurement, 229,969 bee-ghahs; revenue, 13,788,994 dams; seyurghal, 127,732 dams. This sircar furnishes 1180 cavalry, and 10,625 infantry.\"\n\nMandow.\u2014A city in the province of Malwah, the capital of a district of the same name, and situated 47 miles S. S. W. from Oojain.\n\nThis city is now much decayed, but was formerly the capital of the Khillijee Patan sovereigns of Malwah, and is described by Abul Fazel, in 1582, as a city of prodigious extent, 22 miles in circuit, and containing numerous monuments of ancient magnificence. In 1615, when visited by Sir Thomas Roe, it was greatly dilapidated, and its grandeur disappeared. It then occupied the top of a very high and extensive mountain. It is now possessed by the Maharat-\nMANGALORE.\n\nMandavie.\u2014A large fortified sea-port town, in the province of Cutch, situated on the Gulf of Cutch. Lat. 22\u00b0 50'. N. Long. 69\u00b0 34'. E. This place carries on an extensive trade with Malabar and the Arabian coast.\n\nMandowee.\u2014A city in the province of Lahore, possessed by chief's tributary to the Seiks, and situated on the east side of the Beyah River, 140 miles N. E. from Lahori. Lat. 32\u00b0 54'. N. Long. 75\u00b0 48'. E.\n\nMandowee.\u2014A town in the province of Gujrat, district of Broach, situated on the south side of the River Tuptee, 25 miles east from Surat. Lat. 21\u00b0 13'. N. Long. 73\u00b0 25'. E.\n\nMangapett.\u2014A large village in the Nizam's territories, in the province of Hyderabad, 104 miles N.W. from Rajamundry. Lat. 18\u00b0 14'. N. Long. 81\u00b0 5'. E. This place is situated near to the S.W. bank of the Godavery, in the Poloonshah Rajah's country, and is the head of a pargannah of the same name. The mountains continue close down to the east side of the Godavery, opposite to this place; and the wild inhabitants sometimes extend their depredations to this side of the river. (Blunt, &c.)\n\nMangalore. (Mangalur).\u2014A flourishing sea-port town, in the province of South Canara, situated on a salt lake, which is separated from the sea by a beach of sand. At high water, and in fine weather, ships of less than 10 feet water can enter it. Lat. 12\u00b0 49'. N. Long. 75\u00b0 E.\n\nThis town, also named Codeal Bunder, is large, and is built round the sides of the peninsula, in the elevated centre of which the fort was placed. The lake by which the promontory is formed is a most beautiful piece of salt water. Ten miles further up the river is the small town of Areola, which is likewise called Feringy pettah, having formerly been principally inhabited by Coucan Christians, invited to reside there by the Ikerry Rajahs. Its situation on the northern bank of the southern Mangalore River is very fine, and it was formerly a large town; but after Tippoo had taken General Matthews and his army, in 1783, he destroyed the town, and carried away its inhabitants. The whole of the country above Mangalore resembles Malabar, only the sides of the hills have not been formed into terraces with equal industry; the cattle also resemble those of Malabar in their diminutive size.\n\nIn Hyder's reign the principal merchants at Mangalore were Moplys and Concanies; but since the British acquired the government, many men of property have come from Surat, Cutch, Bombay, and other places to the north. These men are chiefly of the Vaisya caste, but there are also many Parsees among them. The shopkeepers are still mostly Moplys and Concanies. The vessels employed in trade chiefly belong to other ports.\n\nRice is the grand article of export, being sent to Muscat in Arabia, Goa, Bombay, and Malabar. In 1800 the current price was 2s. 8d. and 3s. 6d. per bushel; and in 1803, out of 11 lacks of rupees, the total export of Mangalore, rice composed nine lacks, and was then subject to an export duty of 10 per cent. Next to rice, as an export, is betel nut, then black pepper; sandal wood is sent from hence to Bombay, but it is the produce of the country above the Ghauts. Cassia, or dhal china, is sent to Muscat; and turmeric to Muscat, Cutch, Surat, and Bombay. The chief imports are blue cotton cloths from Surat, Cutch, and Madras; and white cotton cloth from Cutch, Bownagur, and other places north from Bombay. Salt is made on this coast by a process similar to that used in Malabar; but the quantity manufactured is very inadequate to the wants of the country; on which account it is imported from Bombay and Goa, and sells for 3d. per bushel. Raw silk, for the use of the manufacturers above the Ghauts, and sugar, are imported from China and Ben-\ngal; and oil and ghee (boiled butter) from Surat. Much of the cloth used in the country is brought from above the Ghauts. The maund at Mangalore is only $28\\frac{1}{2}$ pounds, by which weight the Company buy and sell.\n\nMangalore at a very early period of history was a great resort of Arabian vessels, the productions being peculiarly adapted to that country. The Portuguese also carried on an extensive commerce, and had a factory established here. In 1596 the Arabs of Muscat being at war with the Portuguese, one part of the Arabian fleet run down along the coast of Africa, and destroyed the Portuguese settlement at Bombazar; while the other, stretching across the Indian Seas, burned the factory belonging to that nation at Mangalore. In February, 1768, it was taken by a detachment from Bombay, but retaken by Hyder immediately afterwards, and the garrison made prisoners.\n\nIn 1783 Mangalore again surrendered to a force from Bombay; and, after the destruction of General Matthew's army, sustained a long siege by Tippoo, during which the garrison, under Colonel Campbell, made a most gallant defence. The whole power of that prince, assisted by his French allies, could not force a breach that had long been open, and he was repulsed in every attempt to carry it by storm. On the conclusion of peace, in 1784, it was given up to Tippeo a mere heap of rubbish; what remained was wholly destroyed by him, when he experienced how little his fortresses were calculated to resist European soldiers, and with what difficulty he could retake any of them that were garrisoned by British troops.\n\nTravelling distance from Seriingapatam, 162; from Madras, 440 miles. (F. Buchanun, Bruce, Lord Valentia, &c. &c.)\n\n**Mangeray, (Straits of).**\u2014These straits separate the Island of Floris or Ende from that of Comobo. In general the depth of water exceeds 30 fathoms. On the Floris side are many good harbours and bays, where vessels may anchor. (Bligh.)\n\n**Mangeedara.\u2014**A district in the most eastern quarter of Borneo, extending towards the Sooloo Archipelago, in a long narrow point, named Unsang. The first river in Mangeedara is named Tawoo, opposite to the Island of Sebatic, to the eastward of which is a promontory, named Biraug, the adjacent country affording pasture for many cattle near a river named the Pallass. The peninsula of Unsang terminates eastward in a bluff point, at the north-east point of which is a small island named Tambeesan, forming a harbour capable of admitting ships of a considerable size; the vicinity abounding with fine timber. On this coast there are many rivers, but they have generally bars at their junction with the sea.\n\nMangeedara produces bird nests, wax, lacka wood, dammer, and gold. The most remarkable place for the latter is Talapam, in Gicong Bay; but the river disembogues into the north sea, between Tambeesan and Sandakan. The eastern part of Unsang abounds with wild elephants; and Mangeedara generally with a breed of cattle, originally left here by the Spaniards, who had a footing in the 17th century, which they afterwards, by treaty with the Sooloos, relinquished. (Dalrymple, &c.)\n\n**Manghelly, (Mangalataya).\u2014**A town in the Afghan territories, in the district of Puckholi, and formerly the residence of Shader Khan, the chief of Tiddoon. Lat. 33\u00b0. 32'. N. Long. 72\u00b0. E. (Foster, &c.)\n\n**Manicpoor.\u2014**A district in the Nabob of Oude's territories, in the province of Allahabad, situated about the 26th degree of north latitude. The soil is here fertile, and tolerably well supplied with water, a considerable part of the district extending along the north-east side of the Ganges; but the superior cultivation and prosperity of the contiguous provinces belonging to the British\npoint out the marked difference of the two governments, although that of Oude, generally, has been much improved by the present Nabob. The principal towns are Manicpoor, Dalmow, and Russoolpoor. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, this district is described as follows:\u2014\u201cSircar Manicpoor, containing 14 mahals, measurement 666,222 beegahs, revenue 33,916,527 dams, Seyurgal 2,446,173 dams. This sircar furnishes 2,040 cavalry, and 42,900 infantry.\u201d\n\nManicpoor.\u2014A town belonging to the Nabob of Oude, in the province of Allahabad, 40 miles distant from that fortress, and situated on the N. E. side of the Ganges. Lat. 25\u00b0 47\u2032 N. Long. 81\u00b0 25\u2032 E.\n\nManilla.\u2014A city in the Island of Luzon, and the capital of the Spanish settlements in the Philippines. Lat. 14\u00b0 38\u2032 N. Long. 120\u00b0 50\u2032 E.\n\nThis city stands on the Bay of Manilla, which is 25 leagues in circumference, and receives some considerable rivers; among others, the Pasig, which, flowing from a large lake to the eastward of the town, at the distance of three leagues, falls into the sea, after passing the walls of the fortification to the north. Three leagues distant from Manilla, to the south west, lies the port of Cavite; so called from the word cavit, a fish hook, to which the tongue of land it stands on bears a strong resemblance. Cavite is defended by an indifferent fort, and is provided with an arsenal for the accommodation of the Acapulco ships, and a few small vessels for the defense of the islands against the piratical cruisers. At this port large ships generally unload\u2014the entry of the Manilla River being impeded by a bar, which is very dangerous during high winds; but small vessels ascend the river, and land their cargoes at the city.\n\nManilla is large, and contains many handsome private houses; and, in spite of the earthquakes, some magnificent churches. The surrounding country is fertile, and fit for any sort of culture; but remains almost in a state of nature, having been little improved by the Spaniards. As in the other Spanish possessions, the largest and best part of the town is occupied by monasteries and convents. The town in general was much injured, in 1762, by the natives, who joined the British forces. The houses of the native Indians are made of bamboos, covered with leaves, and extremely combustible. They are raised on wooden pillars, eight or 10 feet from the ground, and are ascended to by a ladder, which is pulled up at night. On account of the frequency of earthquakes, many of the Spanish houses are built in the same manner and of similar materials.\n\nIn 1785 the city of Manilla, with its suburbs, was supposed to contain a population of 38,000 souls, among whom not more than 1000 or 1200 European Spaniards were reckoned\u2014the rest being mulatoes, Chinese, and Tagalas, who cultivate the earth, and carry on the arts of industry. Notwithstanding the dislike the Spaniards have always shewn to allowing the Chinese to colonize, and their repeated expulsion, in 1800 there were from 15 to 20,000 of that industrious nation settled on the Island of Luzon, and engaged in commerce and agriculture. A Chinese captain is appointed by the government, who is responsible for their conduct, and through whom applications for permission to reside must be made. The intercourse with the Chinese port of Amoy, and with the north-eastern ports of China, employs seven or eight junks, which bring over with them from three to 500 new adventurers annually, who work their passage, and import each a small package of goods; and, in these junks, numbers of Chinese annually return. With some difference in point of time, vessels are able to pass between Manilla and China at all seasons of the year.\nAll the necessaries of life are here met with in great abundance; but the cloths, manufactures, and furniture of Europe and India, are extremely dear, on account of the restraints and prohibitions to which commerce is subjected. The horses are indifferent, but cheap: two of the best may be purchased for 30 piastres; in consequence of which the poorest of the Spanish families have one or more carriages. The environs of Manilla, although little cultivated, have a pleasing appearance. A river flows past it, branching into different channels, the principal of which lead to the famous Lagoon or Lake of Bahia, which is surrounded by numerous Indian villages. The food of the natives is rice, which they eat with salt fish and hot peppers.\n\nIn 1785 the garrison of Manilla consisted of two battalions, forming 1300 effective men, mostly Mexican mulattoes. Besides these there were two companies of militia, 150 horse, and also a battalion of militia, raised and paid by a rich Chinese of half blood, named Tu-assou, who was afterwards ennobled. All the soldiers of this corps were Chinese of half blood, and would have furnished but a very feeble aid in time of need. On urgent occasion, a numerous native militia might also be raised, and officered by creoles or Europeans. There is a small corps of 150 men maintained, to supply the garrisons of the Ladronc Isles and of Magindanao.\n\nFrom its advantageous position with respect to India, China, and America, Manilla ought to be a city of the first commercial importance; but, under the government of the Spaniards, its trade has never been encouraged; or rather, until recently, was altogether repressed. Formerly, the entry of foreign European vessels was either altogether prohibited, or burdened with such heavy duties as were equivalent to a prohibition. Chinese, and vessels belonging to the natives, were then alone admitted, and exported the dollars received by the galleons from Mexico.\n\nThe chief articles of export from Manilla are cordage, resinous substances, pitch and tar, cloths, rushes, rattans, indigo of an excellent quality, rice, and cotton; which last, if sufficiently cultivated, might prove a valuable article of exportation to China. The sugar-cane thrives well, but little is manufactured, and the woods abound with a species of bastard cinnamon. The tobacco is good, and makes excellent cigars, which are smoked all day by the Manilla ladies. The cocoa of the island is considered superior to that of America; and the tree is much cultivated, on account of the quantity consumed by the Spaniards. Neither tobacco nor cocoa were indigenous to the Philippines, having been introduced by the Spaniards. Wax may be collected in considerable quantities; and gold is filtered from the rivulets by the Indians, who are sometimes able to procure daily to the value of fifteen-pence each. Native iron is found in masses, and there are considerable quarries of marble, from whence it is procured to decorate the churches.\n\nIn 1810-11, the imports to Bengal from Manilla amounted to 2,969,942 secca rupees, and consisted principally of copper, indigo, and cochineal, with a large proportion of treasure: the exports from Bengal to Manilla were only 1,270,542 rupees, the market having been glutted with Bengal goods in 1808-9.\n\nPrior to the Spanish invasion, Manilla existed as an Indian town. In 1571, Miguel Lopez de Legaspi, the Spanish commander in the Philippines, sailed in person to the Island of Luzon; and, entering the river with his squadron, on the 19th of May, took possession of Manilla, which he constituted the capital of the Spanish possessions in the Philippines.

There is a custom-house established here, where boats ascending or descending these two rivers, undergo an examination.\n\nNear to Manjee is a remarkable banyan, or burr tree, of which the following are the dimensions: diameter, from 363 to 375 feet; circumference of the shadow at noon, 1116 feet; circumference of the several stems, 50 or 60 in number, 921 feet. Formerly under this tree sat a naked fakir, who had occupied that station 25 years; but he did not continue there the whole year through; for his vow obliged him to lie, during the four cold months, up to the neck in the River Ganges.\n\nManowly.\u2014A town in the Maharratta territories, in the province of Bejapoor, 22 miles N. E. from the fortress of Darwar. Lat. 15\u00b0. 58'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 10'. E.\n\nThis place originally belonged to Neel Kunt Row Sindia and his ancestors, which family was dispossessed, about 35 years ago, by the Colapoor Rajah, who was soon afterwards expelled by the Peshwa; Purseram Bhow then held the country until the decline of his power, when it again fell into the hands of the Colapoor Rajah. Some time afterwards, Doondeah Waugh's (the freebooters) partizans obtained possession of it, but it was taken from them by General Wellesley, who gave it to Appah Saheb (Purseram Bhow's eldest son). With him it only remained a year, when Appah Dessaye came with some troops of Dowlet Row Sindia's, and turned him out; since which time it has been held by Appah Dessaye, tributary to the Peshwa. (MSS. &c.)\n\nMansahror, (or Chue Mapuah Lake).\u2014In the mythological poems of the Hindoos, mention is frequently made of two lakes, situated among the Himalaya Mountains, named the Mana Sarovara, and the Vindu Sarovara, from which issue several of their sacred rivers. According to Prawn Poory, a travelling devotee, the Mansahror Lake is situated on an elevated plain, covered with long grass, to the north of which is a conical hill, dedicated to Mahadeva. During the rains the lake is said to overflow, and several streams rush down from the hills; but they soon dry up, the sacred one not excepted. The lake he described as forming an irregular oval, approaching to a circle\u2014pilgrims being five days in going round the lake, which, from its form, appears to resemble the crater of a volcano. The place of worship, or gombah, is to the south, consisting of a few huts, with irregular steps down to the lake, from which the Ganges issues with a small stream, which, in the dry season, is not more than six inches deep. According to the divines of Tibet, four sacred rivers issue from the Manasarova Lake, viz. the Brahmapootra, the Ganges, the Indus, and the Sita.\n\nNotwithstanding these testimonies, the existence of this lake at all is extremely doubtful; and it is known for certain, that the Ganges\ndoes not proceed from it. Hindoo itinerant devotees have, in general, a great faculty at finding what they wish or expect; and, with the assistance of their imagination, easily reconcile difficulties. This part of Asia has not yet been visited by European travellers; but it is certainly extremely desirable to ascertain whether any lake exists within the great Himalaya ridge, and whether any river issues from it, as is generally affirmed; and lastly, whether that river be the Sarjew or Alakanandes, there being Hindoo authorities for both. In the best European maps this lake is placed between the 33d and 34th degrees of north latitude, with a circumference of about 60 miles. (Colebrooke, Wilford, &c.)\n\n**Manwas**, *(Manavasa).*\u2014A small district in the province of Gundwana, situated about the 24th degree of north latitude, and still possessed by independent native chiefs. Like the greater part of the province, it continues in a very barren and uncultivated state, with a thin population of wild inhabitants scattered over a great tract of country.\n\n**Manwas.**\u2014A town in the province of Gundwana, the capital of a district of the same name, and situated 95 miles S. W. by S. from Benares. Lat. 24\u00b0. 13'. N. Long. 82\u00b0. 5'. E.\n\n**Mansir**, *(Manasara).*\u2014A village in the Seik territories, in the province of Lahore, 75 miles N. E. by N. from the city of Lahore. Lat. 32\u00b0. 50. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 20'. E. This place consists of a few houses standing on the margin of a beautiful sheet of water, abundantly supplied with fish; but, being held a sacred or royal property, they live unmolested. (Foster, &c.)\n\n**Manzora**, *(Mansura, victorious).*\u2014A river in the Deccan, which rises in the province of Berder; and, after a short but winding course, falls into the Godavery.\n\n**Maratuba Isles.**\u2014A cluster of islands, six in number, lying off the east coast of Borneo. Lat. 2\u00b0. 15'. N. Long. 118\u00b0. 35'. E. The largest has some wells of fresh water made by the Sooloos, who come there to collect biche de mar, or sea slug.\n\n**Marawas**, *(Maravasa).*\u2014A district in the Southern Carnatic, situated principally between the ninth and 10th degrees of north latitude. To the north it has Tanjore and the Polygar territory; to the south Tinevelly; to the west it is bounded by Madura; and on the east by the sea. In length it may be estimated at 80 miles, by 30 the average breadth.\n\nThis district possesses considerable advantages from its maritime situation, from the progressive increase of its external commerce, and the permanent establishment of a large public investment of cloth, which employs its manufacturers, and maintains a considerable circulating capital. The southern division is remarkably well supplied with water from streams and from tanks, where it is kept above the level of the country. While one body of the peasantry are employed in letting out the water from the tanks, others are ploughing with oxen ankle deep in the mud, and a third set raising mounds round the small divisions of land, to preserve a sufficient depth of water on the surface. Near the sea-coast, in general, the country is extremely well cultivated, and is uniformly flat, and adapted for irrigation.\n\nLike the rest of the Southern Carnatic, this district exhibits many remains of ancient Hindoo religious magnificence, consisting of temples built with large massive stones. At small distances on the public roads are choultries and pagodas, in the front of which are gigantic figures of richly ornamented horses, formed of bricks covered over with chunam, and shaded by fruit and lofty banyan trees. The principal towns are Ramnad, Shevagunga, Armacotta, and Tripatoor.\n\nAt a remote period of Hindoo antiquity, this district formed a part of\nthe great Pandean empire; but, in modern times, came into the possession of the rajas of Shevagunga and Rannad; the first of whom was called the Great Marawa, and the second the Little Marawa, both tributary to the Nabob of the Carnatic, and occasionally refractory. The Company collected the tribute of the two Marawas from the year 1792; and, in 1801, by treaty with the Nabob of Arcot, obtained the complete sovereignty. The district is now comprehended in the collectorship of Dindigul.

In 1775 the number of neegrees, or townships, over which the Dutch Company's influence, and the authority of their resident extended, was 370, the greatest part of the inhabitants were Buggesses, and very industrious in agriculture. These people have their own chiefs, who are appointed by the King of Boni; but they were liable to the Dutch for a tax, which consisted of the 10th part of the rice harvest. (Stavorinus, &c.)\n\nMartaban, (Mandema).\u2014A district in the Birman empire, situated principally between the 15th and 17th degrees of north latitude. Vessels bound from the Straits of Malacca, Prince of Wales Island, and other eastern parts, frequently get entangled in the Bay of Martaban among the shoals, whence a retreat is very difficult, as the tides flow with such strength, and flow so high, as to render anchors nearly useless. (Symes, &c.)\n\nMartaban.\u2014A sea-port town in the Birman empire, the capital of a district of the same name. Lat. 16\u00b0. 30'. N. Long. 97\u00b0. 30'. E. This was once a place of considerable size and commerce, but suffered during the wars of the Birmans with the Peguers and Siamese. Fish maws and shark fins are procured here for the China market.\n\nMarwar, (Marvar).\u2014A large division of the Ajmeer province, situated principally between the 26th and 28th degrees of north latitude, but, in modern times, better known as the Rajah of Joudpoor's territories. In former times, the term Marwar, as including the town and fortress of Ajmeer, became almost synonymous with that of the province. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"Marwar is in length 100 coss, and in breadth 60 coss. Sirear Ajmeer, Joudpoor, Sarowy, Nagore, and Reykaneer are dependent on it. The Rhatore tribe have inhabited this division for ages. Here are many forts, of which the following are the most famous, viz. Ajmeer, Joudpoor, Bicanere, Jelmeer, Amerkote, and Jyenagur.\"\n\nMasulipatam, (Mausalipatan).\u2014A sea-port town in the Northern Circars, district of Candapilly. Lat. 16\u00b0. 5'. N. Long. 81\u00b0. 11'. E.\n\nThe fort of Masulipatam is an oblong square figure, 800 yards by 600, situated in the midst of a salt morass, close to an inlet or canal, which, opening a communication with the sea and the Krishna, enlarges the means of defence without exposing the works to an immediate naval attack, as no ships can come within reach of cannon-shot, nor any approaches be made on the land side, except between the north and east.\npoints of the compass. The pettah, or town of Masulipatam, is situated a mile and a half to the north-west of the fort, on a plot of ground rising above the fort; across which the communication between this ground and the fort is by a straight causeway 2000 yards in length. The town is very extensive, and its site on the further side is bounded by another morass\u2014both of which are miry, even in the driest season.\n\nThe shore at Masulipatam is still, and it is the only port from Cape Comorin on which the sea does not beat with a strong surf, and capable of receiving vessels of 300 tons burthen. It early became a port of commercial resort, and still carries on an extensive foreign commerce; but, notwithstanding the fertility of the adjacent country, watered by numerous small rivers and channels from the Krishna and Godavery, large quantities of rice are annually imported for the consumption of the inhabitants. Masulipatam has long been famous for chintzes, but, although much cheaper, they are neither so handsome, nor of so good a quality, as the European chintzes. The former is an article of very general wear all over Persia, and there is a considerable trade carried on between that port and the Gulf of Persia.\n\nThe trade of Masulipatam extends very little beyond the ports of Calcutta and Bussorah, in the Persian Gulf, and with those places it is principally confined to the article of piece goods; to the latter the export of cloth is very considerable. From Calcutta are imported rice, raw silk, shawls, rum, and sugar; and between this place and the Maldives Islands chintz goods and snuff, to a small extent, have been exchanged for cocoa nuts.\n\nThe total value of imports, from the 1st of May, 1811, to the 30th of April, 1812, 418,235 rupees; of which 306,809 was from places beyond the territories of the Madras government, viz.\n\n| From Balasore | - - - - | 17,325 |\n|---------------|---------|--------|\n| Calcutta      | - - - - | 244,001|\n| Maldives Islands | - - - - | 14,535|\n| Various places | - - - - | 30,948|\n\nArcot rupees 306,809\n\nThe total value of the exports, from the 1st of May, 1811, to the 30th of April, 1812, was 2,136,298 rupees; of which 1,347,733 rupees was to places beyond the territories of the Madras government, viz.\n\n| To Calcutta | - - - - | 24,165 |\n|-------------|---------|--------|\n| Chittagong  | - - - - | 2,196  |\n| Bussorah    | - - - - | 1,239,747|\n| Maldives Isles | - - - - | 7,368 |\n| Various places | - - - - | 14,257|\n\nArcot rupees 1,347,733\n\nIn the course of the above period 755 vessels and craft, measuring 31,277 tons, arrived; and 727 vessels and craft, measuring 31,048 tons, departed.\n\nMasulipatam was conquered by the Bhamenee sovereigns of the Deccan so early as A.D. 1480. In 1669 the French established a factory here; and, in 1751, received possession of the town and fort, when they modernized the defences, and improved it very much. It was taken from them by storm on the night of the 7th April, 1759, by the British troops under the command of Colonel Fordi; the garrison which surrendered amounted to 500 Europeans, and 2537 sepoys and topasses, being considerably more numerous than the assailants. After this event the town and adjoining district were ceded to the British, with whom they have remained ever since, and now form one of the five collectorships into which the Northern Circars were subdivided, on the introduction of the Bengal revenue and judicial system in 1803.\n\nTravelling distance from Calcutta, 764 miles; from Delhi, 1084; from Madras, 292; and from Hyderabad, 203 miles. (Orme, J. Grant, Re-\nports, Malcolm, White, Ferishta, Rennel, &c.)\n\nMASHATTE ISLE.\u2014One of the Philippines, lying due south of the large Island of Luzon, or Luconia, and on the route of the Galleon from Acapulco to Manila. In length it may be estimated at 60 miles, by 17 the average breadth.\n\nMASCAL ISLE.\u2014An island separated from the district of Chittagong in Bengal by a narrow strait, and situated between the 21st and 22d degrees of north latitude. In length it may be estimated at 15 miles, by 10 the average breadth. It is comprehended in the jurisdiction of the Chittagong magistrate, but is thinly inhabited, and indifferently cultivated. Small oysters of an excellent flavour are procured here, and occasionally sea turtle.\n\nMASHANAGUR, (Mahesa-nagar).\u2014An Afghan town in the province of Cabul, situated on the east side of the small river Sewal, about 30 miles west from the Indus. Lat. 33\u00b0. 47'. N. Long. 71\u00b0. 6'. E.\n\nMASWEY.\u2014A town in the Nabob of Oude's territories, district of Lucknow, 16 miles N. N. E. from the city of Lucknow. Lat. 27\u00b0. 4'. N.

Long. 77\u00b0. 37'. E.\n\nThis place is much celebrated and venerated by the Hindoos, as the scene of the birth and early adventures of their favourite deity Krishna; and in the Mahommedan invasion became one of the first objects of their attention, having been taken and destroyed by Mahmood of Ghizni so early as A.D. 1018. It was subsequently rebuilt, and ornamented with several rich temples, the most magnificent of which was erected by Bheer Singh Deo, the Rajah of Oorcha, and cost 36 lacks of rupees. This edifice was afterwards razed by Aurengzebe, who erected a mosque with the materials on the spot. In the fort are still to be seen the remains of an astronomical observatory, built by Rajah Jeysingh of Jeynagur on the banks of the Jumna.\n\nMathura continued subject to the Mogul government until its dissolution, after which it experienced many misfortunes, particularly in 1756, when Ahmed Shah Abdalli inflicted a general massacre on the inhabitants. Towards the conclusion of the 18th century, with the rest of the Agra province, it came into the possession of the Maharatta Sindia family, who confided it to their commander-in-chief, General Perron, as part of his jaghire for the support of his forces. This officer made it his head quarters, strengthened the defences, and established here his principal cannon foundry; it was, however, taken possession of without resistance by the British in September, 1803, and has remained with them ever since.\n\nMathura and Bindrabund, in the vicinity, still continue the resort of Hindoo votaries; but they exhibit no remains of architectural magnificence similar to that exhibited in the temples of the Carnatic. There are a multitude of sacred monkies of a large sort fed here, and supported by a stipend bestowed by Madhajee Sindia. One of them was lame from an accidental hurt; and, in consequence of this resemblance to his patron, who was lame also from a wound received at the battle of Paniput, was treated with additional respect. In 1808 two young cavalry officers inadvertently shot at them, and were immediately attacked by the priests and devotees, and compelled to attempt to cross the Jumna on their elephant, in which endeavour they both perished. The fish in the River Jumna, which winds along the borders of Mathura, are equally protected by the Hindoo faith, and are frequently seen to rise to the surface as if expecting to be fed. (Scott, Turner, Hunter, Kyd, &c., &c.)\nMatura.\u2014A small fort and village near the southern extremity of Ceylon. Lat. 5\u00b0. 52'. N. Long. 80\u00b0. 35'. E. The country round this place abounds with elephants, and it is here they are principally caught for exportation,\u2014a general hunt taking place, by order of government, every three or four years. In 1797, at one hunt, 176 elephants were taken, a number never exceeded at any one time.\n\nMatura lies nearly at the southernmost extremity of Ceylon, and, owing to the nature of the country to the eastward, there is no other European settlement nearer than Batacolo, at the distance of 60 miles. The country which lies between these two places presents the wildest appearance; on which account those who are obliged to go on business from Columbo to Batacolo prefer going by sea; or, if the season be unfavourable, they rather take the circuitous route by the west and north-west coast of the island. The savage Bedahs are found in the woods in this neighbourhood. (Perceval, &c.)\n\nMatwar.\u2014A district in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Khandesh, and situated between the 21st and 22d degrees of north latitude. The principal river is the Tuptee, which bounds it in the southwest; and the chief towns are Sultanpoor and Akrauny.\n\nMawbellypoor, (Mahabalepura).\u2014A small town in the province of Bahar, district of Bahar, situated on the east side of the Soane River, 35 miles S.W. from Patna. Lat. 25\u00b0. 20'. N. Long. 84\u00b0. 50'. E. According to tradition, this was once a country seat of Maha Bali's, round which a town was formed. (Walford, &c.)\n\nMazagong, (Mahesa-grama).\u2014A Portuguese village on the Island of Bombay, where there is a good dock for small ships, and two tolerably handsome Roman Catholic churches. The mangoes are so famous for their excellence, that they were formerly sent to Delhi, during the reign of Shah Jehan.\n\nMeahgunge, (Miahganj).\u2014A town in the Nabob of Oude's dominions, built by the late Ahmass Ali Khan, and formerly the capital of his district. The outer wall is of mud, and encloses several large clumps of mangoe trees and spots of cultivated ground. The inner wall is of brick, not very high, with towers of the same at small distances, and holes in the parapet for musketry. During the life of Almass it was in a flourishing condition, but now partakes of the general decay. That chief kept here his park of artillery, which consisted of 40 pieces; some of large calibre, with ammunition-waggons, and bullocks in proportion. The site of the town is a flat, but it has a small lake on two sides of it, which serves for a ditch. When Saadet Ali, the present Nabob of Oude, succeeded to the throne, and first visited Almass Ali Khan at this place, he received, as a nuzzer (offering), a lack of rupees, piled up as a seat for his highness, which he did not omit to carry with him.

N.\n\nOpposite to this place the Indus is about a mile wide, and has three fathoms water. Three miles east of this place is another village, where the Indus is about a mile and a quarter broad, and continues so for about two miles; after which it becomes narrower, not exceeding three-fourths of a mile wide, with four or five fathoms water.\n\nMeangis Isles.\u2014A cluster of small islands in the Eastern Seas, situated about the 5th degree of north latitude, and the 127th of east longitude.

The farms are neat\u2014each of them containing four or five cottages, better built than houses in the towns usually are, and fenced round to receive the cattle, of which there is great abundance. The fields are divided by thorn hedges, the low grounds prepared for rice, and the high planted with leguminous plants, or left for pasture.

Long. 74\u00b0. 14'. E. This place belongs to the Joudpoor Rajah, and is the boundary between his territories and those of Dowlet Row Sindia in this province.\n\nMercaseral.\u2014A small town in the province of Bengal, district of Chittagong, 35 miles N. by W. from the town of Islamnabad. Lat. 22\u00b0. 48'. N. Long. 91\u00b0. 30'. E.\n\nMerceoot, (Mireuta, the Amer's Cliff).\u2014A small Afghan town in the province of Cabul, 55 miles west from Ghizni. Lat. 33\u00b0. 31'. N. Long. 67\u00b0. 30'. E. The climate here is so cold, that sometimes so early as the end of September water freezes solidly when exposed in a copper vessel suspended from a camel. (Foster, &c.)\n\nMeerjaow, (Midijay).\u2014A town in the province of Canara, 80 miles S. S. E. from Goa. Lat. 14\u00b0. 27'. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 36'. E. The proper name of this place is Midijay, but corrupted in the pronunciation by the Mahomedans. Meerjaow suffered much in a siege by Hyder, and still remains in a ruinous condition. On the south side of the River Tarhilay is a small town named Hegada, where the river, seven miles from the sea, in the month of February, is 700 yards across. The forests, about six miles to the east of Meerjaow, spontaneously produce black pepper. They contain few teak trees, but cassia and wild nutmegs are common. As the latter ripen, the monkeys eat the outer rind.\n\nDr. Robertson thinks this is the Musiris of the ancients; from whence they exported a variety of silk stuffs, rich perfumes, tortoise-shell, different kinds of transparent gems, especially diamonds, and large quantities of pepper. Except the latter, none of the articles above enumerated are at present produced in the country adjacent to Meerjaow. (F. Buchanai, Dr. Robertson, &c.)\n\nMego, or Pulo Mego Isle.\u2014A very small island, situated off the western coast of Sumatra. Lat. 4\u00b0. S. Long. 101\u00b0. 5'. E.\n\nThis island is called Pulo Mego (or Cloud Island) by the Malays, and Triste, or Isle de Recif, by the Europeans. It is small and uninhabited, and, like many others in these seas, is nearly surrounded by a coral reef, with a lagune in the centre. On the borders of the lagune there is a little vegetable mould just above the level of the sea, where grow some species of timber trees.\n\nAll the small low islands which lie off the western coast of Sumatra are skirted near the sea beach so thickly with cocoa nut trees, that their branches touch each other; whilst the interior parts, though not on a higher level, are entirely free\nMEHWAS.\n\nfrom them. When uninhabited, as is the case with Pulo Mego, the nuts become a prey to the rats and squirrels, unless when occasionally disturbed by the crews of vessels which go thither to collect cargoes for the market on the mainland. (Marden, &c.)\n\nMegna River.\u2014This river is formed by the junction of numerous streams issuing from the mountains which form the northern boundary of the district of Sylhet in Bengal; but its course is short, and its bulk small, until its confluence with the Brahmapootra, about Lat. 24\u00b0. 10' N. after which it absorbs the name of the latter, and communicates its own. Eighteen miles S. E. from Dacca it is joined by the Issamutty, bringing the collected waters of the Dullasery, Boorigunga (old Ganges), Luckia, and many smaller rivers, the aggregate forming an expanse of water resembling an inland sea. From hence the course of the Megna is S. S. E. until it approaches the sea, when its volume is augmented by the great Ganges, and they conjointly roll their muddy tide into the Bay of Bengal. Many islands are formed from the sediment deposited by this vast body of water, amongst which number are Dukkinsbabazpoor (30 miles by 12), Hattia, Sundep, and Bamony.\n\nThe sand and mud banks extend 30 miles beyond these islands, and rise in many places within a few feet of the surface. Some future generation will probably see these banks rise above water, and succeeding ones possess and cultivate them; but while the river is forming new islands at its mouth, it is sweeping away and altering old ones in the upper part of its course. In the channels between the islands, the height of the bore (the perpendicular influx of the tide) is said to exceed 12 feet. After the tide is fairly past the islands the bore is but little seen, except in some narrow channels formed by sand banks, the breadth of the main stream admitting the influx of the tide without any lateral impression. (Ronnel, &c.)\n\nMahendry, (Mahendri).\u2014This river issues from a small lake in the province of Gujrat, near the town of Dungerpoor, and after passing the city of Ahmedabad falls into the Gulf of Cambay, having performed a winding course of about 190 miles.\n\nMehlawun.\u2014A town in the province of Allahabad, district of Korah, 55 miles S. W. from Lucknow. Lat. 26\u00b0. 18' N. Long. 80\u00b0. 20' E.\n\nMehwas.\u2014The term Mehwas ought only to be applied to that part of the province of Gujrat named the Kakreze; but of late years Therand and both the Neyers have been included in the denomination, owing to the disorderly state of society. The word Mehwas literally signifies the residence of thieves; but it is now used to designate a country through which it is difficult to pass, from whatever cause. The villages in this country greatly resemble each other. There are a few tiled houses, but the majority are in the shape of a bee-hive thatched, and exhibits a miserable appearance both within and without. Besides the family, it usually affords shelter to a horse and a couple of bullocks or cows.\n\nIn this turbulent region any chief who can muster 20 horsemen claims and extorts a tribute from villages belonging to a power on which he acknowledges himself to be dependent, and to which he pays tribute. Therand levies contributions from the villages in the Saujore district of Joudpoor, from Wow, and from many villages in Rahdunpoor. Merchants travelling in the Mehwas pay stated sums of money to particular Coolees, who ensure their safety as far as a certain place, but beyond these limits pillage immediately. Jamajee of Therah, about 45 years ago, resolved to build small fortified posts to check the Mehwas, but it appears without the desired success.\n\nThe Rajpoots of this part of Gujrat have nearly become Mahommedans, they have adopted so many customs.\npeculiar to sectarians of that faith. Their attendants are chiefly Mahommedans, and, like the Jharyahs of Cutch, they have no scruple in eating what has been cooked by a Mahommedan, or even of eating with him. (Hacmurodo, &c.)\n\nMehkoor.\u2014A mountainous district in the territories of the Nagpoor Rajah, in the province of Berar, situated about the 22d degree of north latitude. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"Mehkoor is a populous country, situated between two of the southern range of mountains of this soubah, one of which is called Bundeh (Vindhyas), and on the top of it are the following forts, viz. Kaweel, Nermalah, Meelgur, Beroosha, Mehawee, and Ramghur.\"\n\nMelah.\u2014A town in the Rajpoor territories, in the province of Ajmeer, 48 miles S. S. E. from Joudpoor. Lat. 25\u00b0 49'. N. Long. 73\u00b0 33'. E.\n\nMelkapoor.\u2014A town in the Nizam's territories, in the province of Berar, 28 miles S. E. from Boorhanpoor. Lat. 21\u00b0 4'. N. Long. 76\u00b0 39'. E.\n\nMenancabow, (Menancabow).\u2014This state, or empire, as it is usually called, is situated in the Island of Sumatra, under the equinoctial line, beyond the western range of high mountains, and nearly in the centre of the island. In ancient times its jurisdiction is understood to have comprehended the whole of Sumatra; in more modern times its limits were included between the river of Palembang and that of Siak on the eastern side of the island; and, on the western side, between those of Manjuta (near Indrapur) and Singkel, where it borders on the independent country of the Battas.\n\nThe present seat, or more properly seats, of this divided government lie at the back of a mountainous district named Tiga-blas-koto (signifying the 13 fortified and confederated towns), inland from the settlement of Padang. The country is described as a large plain, surrounded by hills, producing much gold, clear of wood, and comparatively well cultivated. Although nearer to the western coast, its communication with the eastern side is much facilitated by water carriage, which consists of a large lake, said to be 30 miles in length, from which a river flows eastward, which afterwards takes the name of Indragiri. Along this, as well as the other two great rivers of Siak to the northward, and Jaumbee to the southward, the navigation is frequent, the banks being well peopled with Malay colonies.\n\nWhen Sumatra was first visited by European navigators, this state must have been in its decline, as appears from the political importance at that period of the kings of Achin, Pedir, and Pascey, who still acknowledged the Emperor of Menancabow as their lord paramount.\n\nIn consequence of disturbances which ensued upon the death of Sultan Ali'f in 1780, without direct heirs, the government became divided among three chiefs, presumed to have been of the royal family, and in that state it continues to the present time. Pasamanu, a populous country, and rich in gold, cassia, and camphor, now disclaims all manner of dependence. Each of these sultans assumed all the royal titles, without any allusion to competitors, and assert all the ancient rights and prerogatives of the empire, which are not disputed so long as they are not attempted to be carried into force. Their authority greatly resembles that of the sovereign pontiffs of Rome during the latter centuries. The members of the family are held sacred, and treated with such a degree of superstitious awe by the country people, that they submit to be insulted, plundered, and even wounded by them, without making resistance. The titles and epithets assumed by the sultans are the very climax of inflated absurdity, and his salute only one gun; it being supposed that no additional number could convey an adequate idea of\nrespect\u2014by which expedient he also saves his gunpowder.\n\nThe immediate subjects of this empire, properly denominated Malays, are all of the Mahommedan religion, Menaneabow being regarded as the supreme seat of civil and religious authority in this part of the east; and, next to a voyage to Mecca, to have visited its metropolis, stamps a man learned, and confers the character of superior sanctity. The first Sultan of Menaneabow is by some supposed to have been a shereef, or descendant of the prophet; but tradition claims an antiquity to this empire, far beyond the probable era of the establishment of the Mahommedan religion in Sumatra. It is more probable, therefore, that the empire was instructed and converted, but not conquered, by people from Arabia. The superstitious veneration attached to the family extends, not only where Mahommedanism prevails, but among the Battas, and other people still unconverted to that faith.\n\nThe arts in general are carried to a greater degree of perfection by the Malays of Menaneabow, than by any other natives of Sumatra. They are the sole fabricators of the exquisite, delicate gold and silver filagree. From the earliest period they have manufactured arms for their own use, and to supply the northern inhabitants of the island, who are most warlike, which trade they still continue\u2014smelting, forging, and preparing, by a process of their own, the iron and steel for this purpose, although much is at the same time purchased from Europeans. The use of cannon in this and other parts of India is mentioned by the oldest Portuguese historians, and it must, consequently, have been known there before the discovery of the passage by the Cape of Good Hope. Their guns are of the sort called matchlocks, well tempered, and of the justest bore, as is proved by the excellence of the aim. Gunpowder they make in great quantities; but, either from the injudicious proportion of the ingredients, or the imperfect granulation, it is very defective in strength. Their other weapons are spears, lances, swords, and a small stiletto, chiefly used for assassination. The creese is a species of dagger, of a peculiar construction, very generally worn, being stuck in front, through the folds of a belt. The blade is about 14 inches in length, not straight, nor uniformly curving, but waving in and out, which probably may render a wound given within it more fatal. It is not smoothed or polished like European weapons, and the temper is uncommonly hard. This instrument is very richly and beautifully ornamented, and its value is supposed to be enhanced in proportion to the number of persons it has slain. The custom of poisoning them is but rarely practised in modern times.\n\nThe warlike operations of this people are carried on rather in the way of ambuscade, and the surprising of straggling parties, than open combat. Horses are but little used, on account of the nature of the country, and the ranjans, or sharp-pointed stakes, which are planted in all the roads and passes. The breed is small, well made, hardy, and vigorous, and never shod. The soldiers serve without pay, but the plunder they obtain is thrown into one common stock, and divided among them. The government, like that of all Malay states, is founded on principles entirely feudal. The sovereign is styled Rajah, Maha Rajah, Jaug de Pertuan, or Sultan.\n\nNear to the hot mineral springs at Priaman is a large stone, or rock, on which are engraved characters, supposed by the natives to be European; but this appears improbable, as the European arms never penetrated into this country. It may possibly prove a Hindoo monument, for it has not yet been seen or examined by any native of Europe. (Marsden, &c.)\n\nMENDYGHAUT, (Mhendi-ghat).\nA town in the province of Agra, situated on the west side of the Ganges, 60 miles W. by N. from Lucknow. Lat. 27\u00b0. 3'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 57'. E.\n\nThis place consists of two bazars, protected by two mud forts, each about one mile in circumference, and formerly, for some time, the residence of Almass Ali Khan. Indigo is cultivated in this neighbourhood to so considerable an extent, that, in 1798, one European manufacture produced and sent to Europe 800 maunds (of 80 lbs each). The country, being then subject to the Nabob of Oude, was in so disorderly a state, that he was obliged to surround his works with a small mud fort, to protect them from the depredations of the banditti, with which the province then swarmed. (Tennant, &c.)\n\nMer.\u2014A town in the province of Cutch, situated about 15 miles south from Luckput Bunder, and on the route from that place to the port of Mandavee, in the Gulf of Cutch. Lat. 23\u00b0. 32'. N.\n\nTwo miles W. S. W. from Mer is a village named Dammon. The country between them is well cultivated with banyan trees, growing near the tanks. To the south of this the soil is sandy, and the lands covered with the bauble and milk bushes.\n\nMerat.\u2014A town in the province of Delhi, 32 miles N. E. from the city of Delhi. Lat. 29\u00b0. 1'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 33'. E.\n\nThis place must have been of some note among the Hindoos prior to the Mahommedan invasion, as it is mentioned among the first conquests of Mahmood of Ghizni, A. D. 1018. It is subsequently, in the year 1240, said to have resisted the army of Turmecherin Khan, a descendant of Gengis Khans, but, 1399, was taken and destroyed by Timour. On the departure of this conqueror it was rebuilt, and is now the capital of one of the districts, into which the British possessions in the doab of the Ganges and Jumna were subdivided. On account of its geographical position, it was, in 1809, fixed upon as one of the principal military stations under the Bengal Presidency.\n\nMercara.\u2014A large village in the country of the Coorg Rajah, of which it is the capital, situated 72 miles E. from Seringapatam. Lat. 12\u00b0. 30'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 58'. E.\n\nMergul.\u2014A sea-port town in the Birman dominions. Lat. 12\u00b0. 12'. N. Long. 98\u00b0. 25'. E. This place formerly belonged to the Siamese; but, in 1759, was taken from them by Alompra, the founder of the present Birman dynasty. In 1791 it was besieged by the Siamese, but relieved by the Birmans when reduced to the last extremity. The French cruisers used formerly to frequent King's Island, near Mergui, to procure provisions and water. The principal imports are Madras piece goods, tobacco, and coarse iron cutlery; the exports, rice, ivory, and tin\u2014in addition to which abundance of excellent spars and timber might be procured; but the whole commerce is insignificant. (Synes, Forrest, &c.)\n\nMergui Archipelago.\u2014These islands extend 135 miles from north to south along the coast of Tanasscrim and the Isthmus of the Malay Peninsula, with a strait between them and the main land from 15 to 30 miles broad, having good anchorages, good soundings, and regular tides the whole way. These islands are generally separated by bold channels; some of them are rocky, some hilly, and others flat; but, in general, covered with trees on good soil, and in a climate always favourable to vegetation. In the surrounding seas there are plenty of fish, and the rocks which border the island are encrusted with a small delicate oyster. At spring tides the rise is 12 feet, and the vicinity of the continent moderates the very fresh gales that prevail in the Bay of Bengal during the south-west monsoon.\nThe soil and climate of the Mergui Isles are so good, that it is probable European vegetables and tropical fruits would thrive here; but it does not appear that at present they possess either; not even the cocoa nut, which usually plants itself, although the islands are so well adapted for their production, and they are so abundant in the Nicobaras, about 250 miles to the S.W. They are covered with a great variety of tall timber trees, particularly the Malay poon tree, which is excellent for masts; but it is not yet ascertained whether or not they contain the teak. As yet, the Mergui Islands have only been explored along the sea-coast; but, from the concurrent testimonies of navigators, it may be inferred, that a great proportion of them are not only uninhabited by human beings, but almost destitute of quadrupeds. Captain Forrest, during a maritime survey of considerable duration, never saw any, but observed sometimes the impression of their feet; and once his seamen noticed what they supposed to be elephants' dung. The town of Mergui is situated on an island formed by branches of the Tannassirin River, which, more properly, appertains to the continent than to Archipelago, to which it has given its name. Malay prawns occasionally frequent the Mergui Islands. The Island of St. Matthew, in Lat. 9\u00b0. 56'. N. is recommended by Captain Forrest as the most suitable for an establishment, which might, if necessary, be effected without infringing the rights of the Burmans, who have never taken possession of those, the most distant from the main land, and very probably do not know of their existence. (Forrest, &c.)\n\nMerritch, (Marichi, producing Pepper).\u2014A town in the province of Bejapoor, situated on the banks of the Krishna, 130 miles S. E. from Poonah. Lat. 16\u00b0. 56'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. E. Before the Mahommedan invasion this was the capital of a Hindoo principality; but, in modern times, it has been the capital of different Maharatta chieftains, such as Purseram, Bhow, and Rastia; and is a town of considerable extent and importance. It was taken by Hyder in 1778, but not retained by him. At present it is the head-quarters of Chintaman Row, one of the principal Southern Jaghiredars under the Maharatta Peshwa.\n\nMerud, (Maruda).\u2014A town belonging to the Peshwa, in the province of Bejapoor, 44 miles S. E. from Poonah. Lat. 18\u00b0. 15'. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 86'. E. This place is also named Amravati, and is a large town enclosed with a high wall, and commanded by a fort on its northern side, in which there is said to be a gun as large as those at the city of Bejapoor. (Moor, &c.)\n\nMewar.\u2014A Rajpoot district in the province of Ajmeer, situated principally between the 25th and 26th degrees of north latitude, and occasionally named Chitore and Odeypoor, although it is properly only a subdivision of the latter. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"Mewar contains 10,000 villages, and the whole sircar of Chitore is dependant on it. It is 40 cosses long, and 30 broad, and has three very considerable forts, viz. Chitore, Coombhere, and Mandel. In Chowra is an iron mine, and in Jainpoor, and some places dependant on Mandel, are copper mines.\"\n\nThe general surface of this district is hilly, but not mountainous, although it abounds in naturally strong positions. The soil is fertile in general, but in many places so strongly impregnated with salt and nitre, that the water in many wells, and even in some of the smaller rivers, is brackish during the dry season. It occasionally happens, that, a few yards distant from a brackish well there is another, the water of which is sweet. The productions of this territory are wheat, rice, sugar, barley, and other grains and escu-\ntents; besides which, camels and horses, of a good quality, are reared. The principal manufactures are matchlocks, swords, and cotton cloth of a coarse fabric. The imports and exports correspond with those of Jyewagur. The European and Persian articles come by the way of Gujrat, Jesselmere, and Pawlee; and the imports from the Deccan by Seronge, Oojam, and Indore. The principal towns are Odecypoor, Shapoorah, and Bilarah; and the chief river the Banass.\n\nThis district is at present possessed by numerous petty Rajpoot chiefs, feudatories to the Rannah of Odecypoor, but under a degree of subjection scarcely more than nominal, and in a state of perpetual hostility with each other. They are, in consequence of this disunion, liable to annual visits from Sindia, Holcar, and other Maharatta depredators, who levy the contributions they withhold from their legitimate sovereign. (Abul Fazel, G. Thomas, Broughton, &c.)\n\nMewat.\u2014See Alvar.\n\nMeyahoon.\u2014A town in the Birman dominions, formerly named Loonzay, and famous during the wars between the Peguers and the Birmans, until the former were subdued. Lat. 18\u00b0 19', N. Long. 95\u00b0 8'. E.\n\nThis is a very ancient town, extending two miles along the west margin of Irawaddy, and distinguished by numerous gilded spires and spacious convents. The vicinity is uncommonly fertile in rice, and from hence a large quantity is annually exported to the capital. The Birman sovereign has here spacious granaries built of wood, and always kept replenished with grain, ready to be transported to any part of the empire when a scarcity occurs, which is not unfrequent in the upper provinces, where the periodical rains are not so copious, nor so certain, as in the southern districts. Along the quays there are generally seen about 200 boats, of 60 tons burthen, or upwards. (Symes, &c.)\n\nMiddleburgh.\u2014A small island, about 10 miles in circumference, situated off the north-west extremity of the Island of Ceylon, and attached to the district of Jafnapatnam.\n\nMidnapoor, (Mediapur).\u2014A district in the province of Orissa, situated principally between the 22d and 23d degrees of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by the districts of Ramgur and Burdwan; to the south by the independent zemindary of Mohurbunge and by Balasore; to the east it has Burdwan, Hooghly, and the sea; and to the west Singbhoon and Mohurbunge, with part of Ramgur. In 1784, in all its dimensions, it contained 6102 square miles; but it has probably since received additions, as by an actual enumeration of this district, in 1800, it was found to contain one million and a half of inhabitants; yet the same able report states that two-thirds of this extensive district consist of a jungle swarming with noxious animals, and exceedingly unhealthy, although the land be rich and fertile. About the year 1770, nearly half the people of this country were swept away by the greatest famine recorded in history; but ever since that period, except in 1790, when a partial famine occurred, the numbers have been gradually increasing, and the cultivation prosperous.\n\nThe cultivation here is almost entirely increased by the increase of population, and is very little promoted by plans for the improvement of agriculture, or by revenue regulations. Waste and jungle land, if in a low situation and fit for rice, may be brought into cultivation in one season, and the poorest man can undertake it. The class of mere labourers who work for hire is not in this district numerous, most of the land being tilled by the peasantry who pay the rent.\n\nThe manufactures of Midnapoor\nare few, and much declined in quantity from what they were a century ago, when the Europeans frequented Balasore and Pipley. The inland commerce appears stationary, and there are no extensive commercial enterprizes carrying on, except by Europeans; the Company having much reduced their investment.\u2014Some saunas are made in the district, and more are imported from the contiguous countries to the south and east; plain gauges, adapted for the uses of the country, are also wove. The European planters have introduced the cultivation of indigo, but the quantity exported has never been great.\n\nIn this district there are several forts of mud and stone, but they are now in a state of decay. They were built many years ago, and intended for the defence of the inhabitants against the Maharattas, for which purpose they were effectual. One of them, named Bataw, situated in the jungle quarter of Bangree, lately contained 20 pieces of unserviceable artillery, which were removed by the magistrate. The western parts of this division were formerly much exposed to the depredations of Maharatta robbers, which obliged the zemindars to maintain large bodies of armed men for their protection. Besides these, few natives keep arms of any description, which perhaps, on account of the prevalence of gang robbery, they should be encouraged to do.\n\nIn Midnapoor there are no religious buildings of any consequence. The natives are sometimes, from motives of vanity or piety, induced to dig a tank, but there are few new works of this kind. The remains of the old ones attest the superior opulence of former times, or perhaps rather shew that property was then more unequally divided than at present. The private houses of the zemindars, and other men of note, consist either of forts in ruins, or of wretched huts; nor does it appear they ever were better off in this respect. It may seem surprising that the opulent and respectable natives are so seldom tempted to imitate the commodious dwellings erected by Europeans, and that they have acquired no taste for gardening; but to the climate, and to the manners of the people, must be attributed their perseverance in constructing for their own accommodation nothing but the slightest and most miserable huts.\n\nThe bulk of the people of Midnapoor, like the rest of the Bengalese, do not work with a view to improve their situation, but merely to subsist their families. They scarcely ever think of procuring themselves better food, or better accommodation; and are not stimulated to any efforts of industry by the security they enjoy, but solely by the calls of hunger. They have no luxuries, unless tobacco may be called one; they are always in debt, and borrow at enormous interest; and when by any accident they earn a rupee or two, they remain idle until it is spent.\n\nIn the Midnapoor district celibacy is extremely uncommon; an unmarried Hindoo man of 25, or an unmarried girl of 15, being very rare occurrences. The great bulk of the people live a sober, regular, domestic life, and seldom leave their houses, not being called on for the performance of military service, or public labour. Very few marriages are unproductive; but the women becoming prematurely debilitated and decrepid, do not probably bear so many children as in Europe; barrenness is however extremely rare. Polygamy, prostitution, religious austerity, and the circumstance of young widows seldom marrying a second time, are the chief obstacles, though of no great magnitude, to the increase of population in this district.\n\nAmong the causes of increase are to be reckoned the extreme facility of rearing children. In this territory no infants perish of cold, of diseases proceeding from dirt and bad accommodation; nor except during\nfamines, which are so seldom as scarcely to deserve mention, of unhealthy food. The small-pox sometimes carries off multitudes of children: inoculation, although it has been known for ages, being little practised. As soon as a child is weaned it lives on rice like its parents, requires no care whatever, goes naked for two or three years, and seldom experiences any sickness. A great majority of the inhabitants of this district have preserved their original simplicity and the characteristic features of the Hindoos. They are less quarrelsome, and give less trouble than the natives of the neighbouring districts. Being little in the habit of engaging in lawsuits, they thereby escape the vices and contagion of the courts of justice.\n\nIn Midnapoor there are not any schools where the Mahommedan and Hindu laws are taught, but in every village there are schools for teaching Bengally and accounts to children in low circumstances. The teachers, though persons well qualified for what they undertake, are persons no ways respectable, their rank in life being low, and their emolument scanty. The children sit in the open air, or under a shed, and learn to read, write, and cast accounts, for one or two annas (2d or 4d) per month. A person charged with several thefts being sent for by the judge, and asked his occupation, said it was teaching of children, and on inquiry it appeared he was eminent in his line. On his conviction it seemed to excite no surprise among the natives, that a person of his profession should turn out a thief. In opulent Hindu families teachers are retained as servants.\n\nPersian and Arabic are taught, for the most part, by the Molavies, who in general have a few scholars in their houses, whom they support as well as instruct. Thus Persian and Arabic students, though of respectable families, are considered as living on charity, and they are total strangers to expense or dissipation.\n\nThere was formerly a Mahommedan college at the town of Midnapoor, and even yet the establishment exists, but no law is taught. There are scarcely any Moguls in this district, but one-seventh of the whole inhabitants are estimated to be Mahommedans.\n\nIn this district there exists now an universal impression (and it applies to much the greater proportion of the Company's territories) that property is not liable to confiscation, or gross violation, by supreme authority; which nothing but a very long experience of the admirably impartial distribution of justice in Bengal, could ever influence a native to credit. It was formerly the custom to bury in the earth treasure and valuable goods, and to conceal the acquisition of wealth. This is still done, but generally from the dread of gang robbers; never from any apprehension that the officers of government will lay violent hands on private property.\n\nThe principal places in Midnapoor are the town of that name, Jellalore, Pimpley, and Narraingur; but the district contains no large towns whatever. It was acquired, in 1761, by cession from Cossim Ali, the reigning Nabob of Bengal; and although properly a subdivision of Orissa, has been so long annexed to the former, that much the greater part of what is detailed above may be considered as applying to the whole province of Bengal, as far as regards the manners of the natives. (Sir Henry Strachey, J. Grant, Colebrooke, Kemel, &c.)\n\nMIDNAPPOOR.\u2014A town in the province of Orissa, the capital of a district of the same name, and situated 70 miles W. by S. from Calcutta. Lat. 22\u00b0 35'. N. Long. 87\u00b0 25'. E. This place formerly had a fort, which has been recently converted into a criminal prison. The civil jail and the hospital are thatched buildings at a distance from the fort.\n\nMINDANAO.\u2014See MAGINDANAO.\n\nMINDORO ISLE.\u2014A large island,\none of the Phillipines, situated due south from the S.W. extremity of Luzon, and distant about 20 miles. In length it may be estimated at 110 miles, by 25 the average breadth.\n\nThe interior of this island is mountainous, but along the sea coast the height of the land is moderate, the whole being covered with trees, and making a very beautiful appearance when seen from on board ship. The channel between Mindoro, and the shoals near the Calamine Isles, is only three leagues wide. Mount Calapan, on the eastern extremity, is passed by the galleon on her voyage from Acapulco to Manila.\n\nThe Spaniards, although so long lords paramount of the Philippines, have few establishments here, but the island is otherwise well inhabited. The early navigators, who first visited Mindoro on their return to Europe, insisted that the inhabitants had tails of considerable length. (Meares, Sonnerat, La Page, &c.)\n\nMinpooree (Minapuri).\u2014A small town in the province of Agra, 33 miles N. from the town of Etaweh. Lat. 27\u00b0. 15'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 59'. E.\n\nMirzanagur.\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Jessore, 53 miles N. E. from Calcutta. Lat. 22\u00b0. 56'. N. Long. 89\u00b0. 13'. E.\n\nMirzapoor.\u2014A town in the province of Allahabad, district of Chunar, situated on the south side of the Ganges. Lat. 25\u00b0. 10'. N. Long. 83\u00b0. 35'. E.\n\nThis is one of the greatest inland trading towns in Hindostan, and the mart of all the cotton from Agra and the Maharatta countries. The natives here are more remarkable for their active industry, than in any part of the Company's dominions out of the three capitals, to which they have been much stimulated by the enterprise and energy of the British indigo planters and merchants settled among them. A considerable quantity of filature silk is imported to Mirzapoor from Bengal, and passes hence to the Maharatta dominions and central parts of Hindostan.\n\nIn the vicinity a very durable carpetting, and various fabrics of cotton, are manufactured. The town consists of handsome European houses and native habitations, with clusters of Hindu temples crowding the banks of the Ganges, and seen from the river makes a very lively and animated appearance.\n\nTravelling distance from Benares 30 miles, W. S. W. from Calcutta by Moorshedabad, 754; by Birbhoom, 649 miles. (Volebrooke, Tennant, Lord Valentia, Rennel, &c.)\n\nMiselar Isle.\u2014A small island, about 15 miles in circumference, lying off the Bay of Tappanooy, on the west coast of Sumatra. Lat. 1\u00b0. 39'. N. Long. 98\u00b0. 36'. E. This is a high mountainous island, between which and the main is a channel about four leagues broad, which is navigable. (Elmore, &c.)\n\nMoa Isle.\u2014An island in the Eastern Seas, situated off the eastern extremity of Timor, and intersected by the 128th degree of east longitude. Lat. 8\u00b0. 20'. S. Although an island of considerable size, having several others adjacent, nothing is known respecting it, but its geographical situation.\n\nMocomoco.\u2014A town on the S.W. coast of Sumatra, district of Anak Sungei. Lat. 2\u00b0. 31'. S. Long. 101\u00b0. 10'. E.\n\nFort Ann lies on the southern, and the settlement on the northern side of the Si Luggau River, which name properly belongs to the place also, and that of Mocomoco to a village higher up. The bazar consists of 100 houses, having the sultans at the northern end, which has nothing to distinguish it, except being larger than common Malay houses. Ships arriving here must wait for a boat from the shore, as their own cannot land without great danger.\n\nThe trade here is principally with the hill people in salt, piece goods, iron, steel, and opium; for which the returns are provisions, timber, and a little gold dust. Formerly there was a trade carried on with Padang, and\nother Ate Angin people, but it is now dropped. The soil of the country around this place is sandy, and the face of the country low and flat. The first English settlement at Mocomoco was formed in 1717. (Dare, Marsden, Elmore, &c.)\n\nMOCWANPOOR.\u2014A district in Northern Hindostan, situated principally between the 27th and 28th degrees of north latitude, and bounded to the south by the districts of Bettiah and Tirhoot in Bahar. The valley of Mocwanpoor is of no great extent, not stretching further to the eastward than six or seven miles, and terminating near Nagdeo on the Hettowra side. It is very fertile, yielding abundance and great variety of rice; the cultivators enjoying considerable immunities from the Nepaul government, to which this district now belongs. The ancient Rajah of Mocwanpoor, who was deposed by the Goorkhalies, still resides on the borders of his former territory, under the protection of the Company. (Kirkpatrick, &c.)\n\nMOCWANPOOR.\u2014A town in Northern Hindostan, the capital of a district of the same name. Lat. 27\u00b0 28'. N. Long. 85\u00b0 18'. E.\n\nThe hill fort of Mocwanpoor is distinguishable by the naked eye from the banks of the Kurrah, and is a place of considerable strength. When the Nepaules were hard pressed by the Chinese, the regent and some of the principal chiefs dispatched a great part of their most valuable property to this fort. In 1762 Cossim Ali's Armenian General, Goorgeen Khan, made an attempt on the fortress of Mocwanpoor, but did not succeed. (Kirkpatrick, &c.)\n\nMOHAMMEDABAD.\u2014A district in the Nizam's territories, in the province of Beeder, and situated between the 17th and 18th degrees of north latitude. The principal town is Beeder, named by the Mussulmans Mahomedabad.\n\nMOHAMMEDNAGORE.\u2014A district in the Nizam's territories, in the province of Hyderabad, situated about the 17th degree of north latitude; and comprehending within its boundaries the city of Hyderabad, the Nizam's capital.\n\nMOHUN, (Mahun).\u2014A town in the Nabob of Oude's territories, 16 miles N. N. E. from Lucknow. Lat. 27\u00b0 4'. N. Long. 80\u00b0 58'. E.\n\nMOHURBUNGE.\u2014A district in the province of Orissa, situated about the 22d degree of north latitude. From the district of Midnapoor it is separated by the Subunreeka, the boundary of the Bengal Presidency, until Cuttack was obtained during the government of Marquis Wellesley. This zemindary was formerly of much greater extent, but much curtailed by the Maharattas, who separated Balasor and other tracts of country from it. It still extends westward to the Neelghur Hills. During the Maharatta government Mohurbunge was dependent on Cuttack, but paid also an inconsiderable tribute to the Company, on account of some lands in Midnapoor, north of the Subunreeka River.\n\nWhere no battles are fought, and the natives remain unmolested by military exactions, and when the zemindar or his agent remain unchanged, the lands of the Maharatta districts in the neighbourhood of Midnapoor are in a state of high cultivation, and the population is equal, frequently superior to the British districts. One cause which tends to increase the population of a well-superintended Maharatta estate, is the constant accession of numbers by emigration from the neighbouring countries. It is the interest of the proprietor of a zemindary to take as much care of his cultivators as a farmer does of his cattle, and that is sufficient to promote their increase. The peasantry in the Company's territory enjoy that degree of security which is essential to their increase, which is not the case with the far greater portion of the Maharatta country; vast tracts of which are desolated, fa-\nmines frequent, and the population diminishing.\n\nThere are no towns of any considerable magnitude in this district; but there are many chokeys, or tolls, for the purpose of collecting money from the pilgrims going to Juggernaut. (Sir H. Strachey, J. Grant, 1st Register, &c.)\n\nMolucca Isles, (Maluka).\u2014This term, in its most extensive application, is understood to signify all the islands situate to the east of the Molucca Passage, in Long. 126\u00b0. E., particularly those of Gilolo; but in its more limited sense, it is usually restricted to the Dutch spice islands, which are Amboyna, Banda, Ceram, Ternate, Tidore, and Batchian.\n\nWhen the Moluccas were first visited by the Portuguese navigators dispatched by Albuquerque, A.D. 1510, they were found occupied by two distinct races of people; the Malays, or Mahomedans, on the sea-coast, and the oriental negroes, or mop-headed Papuas, in the interior. The latter have ever since been rapidly decreasing, and, in most of the smaller islands, have wholly disappeared; but in the more eastern islands they have held their ground, and still retain undisturbed possession of Papua or New Guinea.\n\nThe Malays of these islands have adopted so many foreign words, that their dialect differs very much from the common Malay, and in writing they occasionally make use of the Latin characters to express the Malay language. The ancient Tirmata, or Molucca language, appeared to Dr. Leyden to have been an original tongue. Among the islands are many of the pretended descendants of Mahomed, named Shereefs, who are held in great respect, particularly if they have performed the pilgrimage to Mecca. Under their respective heads further particulars respecting these islands will be found. (Forrest, Leyden, &c.)\n\nMonchaboo.\u2014A town in the Birman empire of small size, but much venerated as the birth-place of the great Alompra, the founder of the present dynasty, and during his short and active reign the capital. The distance from Rangoon to Monchaboo by the Irrawaddy is 500 miles. Lat. 22\u00b0.40'. N. Long. 96\u00b0. 20'. E.\n\nMoncoorah Isle, (Manacura).\u2014An island situated to the south of Dukkinshahabapoor, at the mouth of the great river Brahmapootra and Ganges, here denominated the Megna, and the most southerly of all the islands yet formed of the sediment deposited by their waters. In length it may be estimated at 10 miles, by three and a half the average breadth.\n\nMonear.\u2014A small town in the province of Bahar, district of Bahar, situated at the junction of the Soane and Ganges, 17 miles west from Patna. Lat. 25\u00b0.38'. N. Long. 84\u00b0. 56'. E. Commodious cantonments for cavalry are erected here.\n\nMonghir, (Madga-ghiri).\u2014A largo district in the province of Bahar, situated between the 26th and 28th degrees of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by Tyrhoot and Purnah; on the south by Ramgur and Birbroom; to the east it has Rajjemal and Birbloom; and to the west the Bahar district and Ramgur. In 1784 this district, in all its dimensions, contained 8270 square miles, of which only 2817 are in the Boglipoor division on both sides of the Ganges. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Mungeer, containing 31 mahals, revenue 109,625,981 dams. This sircar furnishes 2150 cavalry, and 50,000 infantry.\"\n\nThe traditional account of Monghir is, that it was formerly only inhabited by Thadufarkurs, of the class denominated Rick, who resided chiefly in the woods. One of those whose habitation was upon a rock in the River Ganges, is said, with the assistance of Vishwa Karma, the god and patron of artists, to have built a fort, and named it Monghir. The country is described as being at that time in a complete jungle, without a vestige of cultivation, but\ncontaining a temple dedicated to the goddess Chandi. The district is now one of the best cultivated in the Company's dominion, the agricultural labour being managed with exemplary activity and persevering diligence. The fields in the neighbourhood of the town of Monghir are divided into squares, and irrigated with great care. They produce a great variety of leguminous plants, mustard seed, and castor oil, besides opium, barley, and other grain.\n\nIn this district is a hot-well, named Sectacoond, a common appellation for hot-springs among the Hindoos. It is situated about half a mile from the banks of the Ganges, in a plain backed by hills with several rocks about it. The spring is considerable, and the air-bubbles rise in great quantities. The water is too hot to admit keeping the hand long in it, yet there are cold springs on the sides of it, at the distance of about 20 paces. In 1801 the inhabitants of the Monghir, or Boglipoor district, were estimated at 600,000. (Adair, Tennant, Lord Valentia, &c.)\n\nMonghir.\u2014A town and fortress in the province of Bahar, situated on the south bank of the River Ganges, Lat. 25\u00b0 23' N. Long. 86\u00b0 38' E.\n\nThe fort of Monghir is large, surrounded by a wall and deep ditch, and is a place of considerable antiquity. It is most beautifully situated on a bend of the Ganges, which, in the rainy season, forms here a prodigious expanse of fresh water, bounded by the Goriruckpoor Mountains. Monghir was the chief residence of Sultan Sujah during his government of the Bengal province, and was strengthened by him during his rebellion against his father, Shah Jehan. Subsequently it became the residence of Cossim Ali Khan, when he intended to throw off all dependence on the English government, which had raised him to the throne. He added considerably to the strength of the fortifications, and endeavoured to discipline the natives for its defence; but in vain, for it was taken by the English after a siege of only nine days.\n\nWhile Monghir was a frontier town it was a place of considerable importance, and a depot of ammunition; but since the cessions in the doab of the Ganges and Jumna, Allahabad has been selected in its stead as a frontier depot. The protruding point of the rock at this place, which withstands the whole force of the river, is considered as a sacred bathing place by the Hindoos, and during the season the crowd is prodigious. The view from the fort is one of the finest in India. It is at present occupied by some companies of invalid sepoys, their commandant having possession of the ruins of Sultan Sujah's palace. The rest of the space is occupied by gardens, tanks, and plantations.\n\nTravelling distance from Monghir to Calcutta, by Birbhum, 275 miles; by Moorshedabad, 301 miles. (Lord Valentia, Remel, &c.)\n\nMonishwar, (Manjeswara, the Chief of Gems).\u2014A town in the province of Bejaapoor, situated about 30 miles S.W. from Poonah. Lat. 18\u00b0 16' N. Long. 74\u00b0 25' E. This is a town of considerable extent, with a good market. There is here a very handsome dome erected over a small square building, which in this province is effected in the following manner: A mound of earth is raised, the intended height and shape of the dome or arch, over which the stones are placed, and when completed on the outside the support is removed. The inhabitants have but little knowledge of the powers of mechanism: when a large stone is to be raised, it is dragged up a slope of earth, made for the purpose, which is afterwards removed. (Moor, &c.)\n\nMoogul, (Madgaola).\u2014A district in the Nizam's dominions, in the province of Bejaapoor, situated principally between the 16th and 17th degrees of north latitude, and extending along the south side of the\nKrishna River. The chief towns are Moodgul, Anamsagur, and Cooloor. This district was ravaged by the Mahommedans so early as A.D. 1312, during the reign of Alla ud Deen on the Delhi throne.\n\nMoodgul.\u2014A town in the province of Bcjaapoor, belonging to the Nizam, the capital of a district of the same name. Lat. 16\u00b0. 6'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 47'. E.\n\nMooloofetty.\u2014A town on the sea-coast of the southern Carnatic, district of Marawas, 123 miles N. E. from Cape Comorin. Lat. 9\u00b0. 15'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 53'. E.\n\nMOOLTAN, (Multan).\n\nA province in Hindostan, situated principally between the 28th and 31st degrees of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by Lahore and Afghanistan; to the south by Ajmeer and Sinde; to the east it has Lahore and Ajmeer; and to the west Balloochistan. When Abul Fazel composed the Institutes of Acber, Mooltan was one of the largest provinces in the empire, extending to the frontiers of Persia, and comprehending the modern countries of Mooltan, Balloochistan, Sinde, Hajykan, Sewcestan, and Tatta, besides several of the doabs now attached to Lahore. Since that era the dimensions have been so curtailed, that it is one of the smallest provinces in Hindostan, the exact extent of its limits being still uncertain. Abul Fazel's description, which applies to the province in its greatest magnitude, in 1582, is as follows:\n\n\"The soubah of Mooltan lies in the first, second, and third climates. Before that Tatta was comprised in this soubah it measured in length, from Ferozeepoor to Sewistan, 403 coss, and was in breadth from Khutpoor to Jelmeeer 108 coss; but, with the additional length of Tatta, it measures to Cutch and Mekran 660 coss. On the east lies sircar Sirhind; the pergunnah of Jhoor joins it on the north; on the south it is bounded by the province of Ajmeer; and on the west are situated Cutch and Mekran, both of which are independent territories. The six rivers described in Lahore pass through this soubah. The River Behut, near the pergunnah of Shoor, unites with the Chinanb; and then, after running together 27 coss, they disembogue themselves into the River Sinde, near Utch. For the distance of 12 coss, near Ferozeepoor, the rivers Beyah and Sutuleje unite, and then again, as they pass along, divide into four streams, viz. the Hur, the Haray, the Dund, and the Noormy; and near the city of Mooltan these four branches join again. All the rivers that disembogue themselves into the Sinde (Indus) take its name, but in Tatta the Sinde is called Mehran.\n\n\"The mountains of this soubah lie on the north side. In many respects it resembles Lahore, except that but little rain falls here, and the heat is excessive. Between Sewee and Behkar (Backar) is a large desert, over which during the summer months there blows the pernicious hot wind called the simoon. The River Sinde some years inclines to the north, and sometimes to the south, and the villages change accordingly. This soubah contains three sircars, divided into eight pergunnahs. The measured lands are 3,273,932 beegahs. Revenue, 151,403,619 dams; out of which 659,948 are seyurghal. It furnishes 13,785 cavalry, and 165,650 infantry.\"\n\nThe more northern and eastern districts of this province are extremely fertile, being watered by the Punjab Rivers, and possessing a rich soil, which becomes gradually more sandy and barren as it approaches the Indus. To the west of that river this sterility increases, until it terminates in a rocky ridge of hard black stone, the boundary of the western desert.\n\nAnterior to the invasion of Hin-\ndostan by Mahmood of Ghizni, this province appears to have been possessed by Mahommedans, as, in A.D. 1006, he is applauded by Persian authors for having subdued Daoud Khan, an Afghan heretic, who then occupied the country, and compelled him to embrace the true faith; from which, however, he soon apostatized. At present the province of Mooltan is possessed by different petty chiefs, at variance with each other, and harassed from without by the Afghans, Seiks, and Amirs of Sinde. Being remotely situated from the British territories, possessing no political or commercial importance, and being little visited by Europeans, we are probably less acquainted with the interior of this, than of any of the other original provinces of Hindostan Proper. (Abul Fazel, Rennel, Stewart, &c.)\n\nMooltan.\u2014A city in the province of Mooltan, of which it is the capital, situated near to the east side of the Ravey River after its junction with the Jhyulum and Chinaub, and about 30 miles above its confluence with the Indus. Lat. 30\u00b0 35' N. Long. 71\u00b0 19' E. This place stands nearly at the same distance from the sea as Allahabad; that is, from 800 to 850 British miles by the course of the rivers. Mooltan is supposed to have been the Malli of Alexander, and is described by Abul Fazel, in 1582, as one of the most ancient cities of Hindostan, with a brick fortress and lofty minaret, and possessing the tomb of Sheikh Bahandeen Zukmi, a Mahommedan saint. It appears to have been the seat of a principality so early as A.D. 1006, when it was plundered by Mahmood of Ghizni, a fate which it again experienced in 1398, when captured by the Mogul army of Timour.\n\nMooltan at present is a large walled town, with a citadel of considerable strength, and for many years acknowledged a subjection scarcely more than nominal to the Afghan sovereigns of Cabul. In 1806 it was attacked, captured, and plundered by Rajah Runjeet Singh, the Seik chief of Lahore, who was compelled to evacuate it by the scarcity of grain that prevailed in his camp. In 1809 the Nabob of Mooltan had submitted to pay tribute to the Amirs of Sinde. He was then described as being able to collect a considerable body of men, but wholly unable to support them, on account of the sterility and poverty of his country. (Abul Fazel, Rennel, MSS. &c.)\n\nMooneer, (Manir).\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, district of Rotas, 42 miles E. by S. from Benares. Lat. 25\u00b0 12' N. Long. 83\u00b0 40' E.\n\nMoorgoor, (Mudaghar).\u2014A town of considerable extent, belonging to the Peshwa of the Maharattas, situated in the province of Bejapoor, about 15 miles N.W. from Darwar. It is enclosed by a wall, and surrounded by a ditch.\n\nMoorley, (Murali).\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Jessore, 62 miles N.E. from Calcutta. Lat. 23\u00b0 7' N. Long. 89\u00b0 15' E.\n\nMoorleydurseray, (Murali dhabra serai).\u2014A town in the province of Agra, district of Etawah, 42 miles E.S.E. from the city of Agra. Lat. 27\u00b0 1' N. Long. 78\u00b0 40' E.\n\nMoorshedabad,\u2014A large town in the district of Ranjeshy, province of Bengal, of which it was for some time the capital. Lat. 21\u00b0 11' N. Long. 88\u00b0 15' E. It was originally named Muckhsoosabad; but in 1704, when Moorshed Coolee Khan transferred here the seat of government, he changed its name to Moorshedabad.\n\nThis place extends eight miles along both sides of the most sacred branch of the Ganges, named the Bhagiratty, or Cosimbazar River, about 120 miles above Calcutta. The buildings are in general bad, and the palace of the nabobs so insignificant, as to be passed without observation. The streets are narrow and inconvenient, and almost impassible for European wheeled carriages. The\ntown was never fortified, except by an occasional rampart in 1742, during the Maharatta invasion. It is a place of great inland traffic, and the river is seen constantly covered with boats, which are examined at the custom-house established here. From October to May the Cossimbazar River, or Bhagiratty, is almost dry; united with the Jellinghy further down, they form the Hooghly, or Calenta River. The Mootyjeel, or Pearl Lake, in this neighbourhood, is one of the windings of a former channel of the Cossimbazar River. During the reign of Ali Verdy Khan, a palace was erected in it, and ornamented with pillars of black marble brought from the ruins of Gour, the ancient capital of Bengal.\n\nThe neighbourhood of Moorshedabad is the chief seat of the manufacture of wove silk; taffeta, both plain and flowered; and many other sorts for inland commerce and exportation are made more abundantly than at any other place where silk is wove. The appearance of the surrounding district exhibits a progressive improvement in cultivation and population; but no traces of increased commerce, nor improvement in buildings for religious or domestic purposes. Individuals occasionally build a temple, or dig a tank for public use; but similar endowments of former days are going to decay, and among the natives no degree of opulence ever tempts them to improvements in their domestic habits or comforts.\n\nGang robbery, or dacoity, is the most prevalent crime in this part of Bengal. Few of the lower order of natives keep any other arms in their houses than long thick bamboo bludgeons. Particular classes keep spears for the declared purpose of destroying wild hogs, and some of the head villagers and village watchmen have swords. Bludgeons, spears, and fishgigs, are the usual arms found on gang robbers. Sometimes the latter use a long tapering solid bamboo, pointed at one end, and hardened in the fire; but they very seldom use swords, and almost never fire-arms. The middle and higher classes keep swords and daggers as appendages of dress.\n\nMoorshedabad became the capital of Bengal in 1704, when the seat of government was removed from Dacca by the Nabob Jaffier Khan, and it continued the metropolis until the conquest of Bengal by the British in 1757, when it was virtually, though not nominally, superseded by Calcutta. Until 1771 it remained the seat of the collector-general of the board of revenue, being more central than Calcutta; but in that year they were transferred to the latter place.\n\nThe Nabob Jaffier Khan, who made this place his capital, was born of a Brahmin, bought while an infant, and educated in Persia by a Mohammedan. He was appointed soubahdar of Bengal by Aurungzebe; and on his death, by the assistance of Juggeth Sect, the banker, he purchased the continuance of his office; besides which he discomfited two other soubahdars, sent by the court of Delhi to expel him. He died A.D. 1725, and was succeeded by his son-in-law,\n\nShujah ud Dowlah, who continued nabob until 1739, when, on his decease, his son,\n\nAllah ud Dowlah Serferauz Khan ascended the musnud, but was de-throned and killed, after a reign of one year and two months, by\n\nAliverdi Khan, who, after an active and eventful reign, died in 1756, and was succeeded by his grandson,\n\nGholam Hosein Seraje ud Dowlah. Two months after his accession this prince attacked and took Calcutta; but in the same year was defeated at Plassey by Colonel Clive, and soon after assassinated by the son of his successor, in 1757,\n\nMeer Jaffier Khan, who, on account of his incapacity, was de-throned by the British in 1760, and Meer Cossim Ali Khan raised to the throne. In 1763 this prince was\nexpelled by the British, and his predecessor, Meer Jaffier Khan, reinstated. After reigning one year, in 1764, he was succeeded by his eldest son,\n\nNudjam ud Dowlah, who, in 1766, died of the small-pox, and was succeeded by his brother,\n\nSeif ud Dowlah, who died in 1769, in which year a famine and epidemic distemper raged with great violence. His successor was\n\nMubaric ud Dowlah, whose allowances were at first 24 lacks of rupees per annum; but subsequently, in 1772, reduced to 16 lacks. This prince died in 1796, and was succeeded by his son,\n\nNazim ul Muluck, who died the 28th April, 1810, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Seid Zin ud Deen Ali Khan, then 17 years of age.\n\nBesides being the residence of the native prince, Moorshedabad is the head-quarters of a court of circuit, having the following districts subordinate, viz. 1. Monghir, or Bogli poor; 2. Purneah; 3. Dinagepoor; 4. Rungpoor; 5. Raujeshy; 6. Bubhoom; and 7. The city of Moorshedabad. In 1801 the inhabitants of the Moorshedabad district were estimated at 1,020,572, in the proportion of one Mahomedan to three Hindoos. (Scott, Lord Valentia, Revenel, 5th Report, Stewart, Colebrooke, &c. &c.)\n\nMoota Gunga, (Muti Ganga, the Pearl Stream).\u2014A river in the province of Gundwana, which has its source in the Mehkoo Hills, from whence it flows, in a south-easterly direction, past Chinnceer, but its course further has never been properly ascertained.\n\nMootyjerna, (Mutijesua).\u2014A cataract in the province of Bahar, district of Monghir, situated about eight miles inland from the Ganges. It consists of two falls, which, taken together, measure 105 feet perpendicular height. The water, after falling over vast masses of rock, is received in a basin below. At the bottom of the lower fall is a cave, from within which the water may be seen, forming an arch on the outside.

Long. 78\u00b0. 45'. E. This was formerly a place of consequence, and possessed a mint, the Moradabad rupees being still current in Hindostan. It has since greatly declined; but will probably experience rapid improvement from having a district attached to it, which took place in 1804, some time after the cession of the Bareily Province to the British by the Nabob of Oude. The judge, and magistrate, and collector of the revenue, with their respective establishments, reside at Moradabad.\n\nMorabad.\u2014A town belonging to Sindia, in the province of Ajmeer, 40 miles E. from the city of Ajmeer.

The principal towns are Merritch and Carrar.\n\nMorty (or Morintay) Isle.\u2014An island in the Eastern Seas, situated off the north-eastern extremity of Gilolo, and comprehended principally between the second and third degrees of north latitude. In length it may be estimated at 65 miles, by 18 miles the average breadth.\n\nThis island has a pleasing appearance from the sea, the land rising gently from the beach to a considerable height in the centre, but without any precipitous elevation. The country is thinly inhabited, but is said to abound with sago trees; to cut down which, for the pith and flower, parties go from Gilolo. The Sultan of Ternate formerly claimed the sovereignty of this island. (Forrest, &c.)\nMORUNG, (Mayur Anca, remarkable for Peacocks).\u2014A district in Northern Hindostan, tributary to the Nepaulese, situated about the 27th degree of north latitude, and bounded on the south by the district of Purneali, in Bengal. The face of the country is uncommonly mountainous, some of the highest attaining an elevation of nearly 7000 feet, with a very sudden rise from the plains of Bengal. It abounds with timber, which is occasionally floated down the River Cosa and other streams from the mountains; but the quantity procured has never been great; and the climate being singularly unhealthy, the interior has been but little explored.\n\nMORWARRA.\u2014A town in the district of Neyer, situated about 30 miles S. S. W. from Theraud, and subject to the same family of Rajputs.\n\nThis is a populous town, without any defences, but has a large tank, and is in every respect a flourishing place. The surrounding country is much infested by the plundering Coolies, who are, however, much afraid of fire-arms.\n\nMOSE ISLE.\u2014An island in the Eastern Seas, about 30 miles in circumference, situated due north from Timorlant, and about the 132d degree of east longitude.\n\nMOUNT DILLY.\u2014A hill on the sea-coast of the Malabar Province, which is separated from the continent by salt water creeks, and forms on the coast a remarkable promontory.

Lat. 29\u00b0. 48'. N. Long. 71\u00b0. 51'. E.\n\nMPCHOO RIVER.\u2014This river, which is the largest in the Gujrat Peninsula, has its source at Sirdar, a few miles from Wankaneer, which it passes, as also Moorbee, and within a mile of Mallia; after which it empties itself by many months into the Run. During the height of the rains it overflows the adjacent country.\n\nMUDDEE.\u2014A village in the western extremity of the Gujrat Peninsula, situated on the S. E. bank of the Run, and on the sea-shore. Lat. 22\u00b0. 5'. N. Long. 69\u00b0. 22'. E.\n\nThis strange morass (the Run) here, at a distance, appears covered with water; but, when approached, the deception is discovered to proceed from a thick coat of salt as white as snow. From Muddee, towards Bhattia, the soil is good, and well adapted for pasture and the cultivation of wheat; but the whole\nis nearly desolate\u2014the peasantry being afraid to trust their grain in the ground, on account of the Oka thieves. In 1809 Muddee contained but one family, and from hence to Bhatta not a human being was to be seen.\n\nThe land thieves of Oka are here named Kaba, a sanscrit word, which signifies a searcher or seeker, on account of the severe scrutiny all pilgrims and unprotected travellers undergo. The rags of the Byraggee are carefully examined, and the ball of ashes with which he covers his body is broken by these robbers in hopes of finding some small coin concealed in it. (Macmurdo, &c.)\n\nMuckealnah.\u2014A town in the Seik territories, in the province of Lahore, 83 miles N. W. from the city of Lahore. Lat. 32\u00b0. 33'. N. Long. 72\u00b0. 43'. E.

E. from Kotah, in a valley nearly circular, three-fourths of a mile in diameter, surrounded by very steep hills, and only accessible by an opening to the south, and another to the north, each of which is defended by a stone wall and a gate. This is the only pass within many miles through a ridge of mountains which extends to the east and west, dividing the province of Malwah from the district called Harowty, or country of the tribe Hara. At Chunkhairee, 14 miles to the eastward, a great fair for horses and cattle is held. Lat. 24\u00b0. 48'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 12'.

The mountains in this territory rise to great elevation above the plains of Bahar, and the country, in general, is covered with extensive forests, capable of supplying great quantities of valuable timber. This district is but little cultivated, being possessed by petty native chiefs tributary to the Ghoorkhali Rajah of Nepaul.\n\nMufanagur.\u2014A small town in the Nabob of Oude's territories, 74 miles S. W. from Lucknow. Lat. 26\u00b0. 11'. N. Long. 80\u00b0. E.\n\nMuganayakana Cotay.\u2014A village in the Mysore province, district of Hagalwadi. Lat. 13\u00b0. 8'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 58'. E. During the war of 1790, it was besieged for two months by a force consisting of 2000 of Purseram Bhow's Maharattas, with one gun, which they fired several times, but never succeeded in hitting the place. It now contains above 200 houses, and is fortified with a mud wall. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nMuglee.\u2014A town among the Eastern Ghauts, situated 95 miles west from Madras. Lat. 13\u00b0. 10'. N.

E.\n\nMulana.\u2014A small walled town with a citadel, not far from Mustaphabad, in the northern quarter of the province of Delhi.\n\nMulayne.\u2014A large village in the Nabob of Oude's territories, 42 miles N. W. from Lucknow. Lat. 27\u00b0. 4'. N. Long. 80\u00b0. 10'. E. The in-\nhabitants are numerous, but the town is mean and irregular, consisting almost entirely of small mud huts. The surrounding country is tolerably well cultivated.\n\n**Mulchand Kalaudy.**\u2014A small building for the accommodation of travellers, in the province of Sinde, district of Tatta, 10 miles east from Corachie.\n\nThe surrounding country is a hard sandy soil, bounded by rocky hills to the north, and covered with clusters of the milk bush, a shrub called lye by the Sindeans, and a small prickly shrub; the whole abounding with jackals, hares, and partridges. Four miles from Corachie there is a range of scraggy sterile hills, on the tops of which are several tombs, but not a tree is to be seen. At this place there are some wells of good water.\n\nFive miles further on there is a choultry erected by Hajee Omar, and near to it a well of excellent water, 140 feet deep, dug to supply travellers; an act of charity duly estimated in this arid and sultry region. The country around this choultry is so hard, and the water so remote from the surface, that the labourers must for a long time have been supplied with water brought from a distance, before they could reach that which they were in search of. *(Smith, Maxfield, &c.)*\n\n**Mulihaara,** *(Mulaahara).*\u2014A town in the province of Allahabad, five miles N.

Long. 76\u00b0. 17'. E.\n\n**Mundessor.**\u2014A large district in the province of Malwah, situated principally between the 24th and 25th degrees of north latitude. The country is elevated and hilly, but fertile, being watered by the River Chumbul, which intersects it. The principal towns are Soonel, Bam-poor, and Parkundy; and the district is possessed by different native chiefs, who are tributary to the Maharattas.\n\n**Munderar.**\u2014An Afghan district in the province of Cabul, situated about the 35th degree of north latitude, and bounded on the south by the River Chuganserai, the chief town being also named Chuganserai. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, this district is described as follows:\n\n\"Tooman (district) Munderar abounds with monkies. Here the rivers Alishung and Alunkar unite their streams, and disembogue themselves into the River Baran. The River Chuganserai, after passing through the N. E. quarter enters Kuttore. Revenue of tooman Munderar 2,684,880 dams.\"\n\n**Munduim.**\u2014A village in the territory of the Mysore Rajah, fortified with a mud wall. Lat. 12\u00b0. 31'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 4'. E.\n\nThe country between Chinapataum and this place, although free from hills, is not more than one half arable, the soil being in general poor and covered with brushwood. Many parts of the hills are cultivated, but much more is incapable of ever becoming arable. The wet cultivation does not exceed one-fifth of the whole.\nMundlah, (Mandala).\u2014A town in the province of Gundwana, situated on the banks of the Nerbud-dah, 140 miles N. E. from Nagpoor. Lat. 22\u00b0. 44'. N. Long. 81\u00b0. 10'. E. This town was one of the ancient capitals of the Hindoo province of Gundwana, and formerly gave its name to the surrounding district.\n\nTravelling distance from Nagpoor, 160 miles; from Hyderabad, 476; from Calcutta, 634 miles. (Leckie, J. Grant, Rennel, &c.)\n\nMungulwara, (Margalavar).\u2014A town belonging to the Poona Maharattas, in the province of Beja-poor, 16 miles S. E. from Panderpoor. This is a considerable town fortified with a stone wall, and possessing a good market. The surrounding country is stony and uncultivated.\n\nMunglore.\u2014An Afghan town in the province of Cabul, district of Sewad, situated 30 miles west from the Indus. Lat. 34\u00b0. 13'. N. Long. 71\u00b0. 15'. E. By Abul Fazel it is described as follows:\n\n\"Near the pass of Dhuanglar, adjoining to Cashgnr, is the city of Munglore, the residence of the governor of the province. There are two routes to it from Hindostan; one by the height of Mulmund, and the other by the pass of Shere Khan.\"\n\nMungelhaut, (Mangala hata, a Flourishing Market).\u2014A large manufacturing town in the province of Bengal, district of Rungpoor, 20 miles north from the town of Rungpoor. Lat. 25\u00b0. 59'. N. Long. 89\u00b0. 20'. E.\n\nThis place is situated on the south side of the River Durlah, which divides Rungpoor from Cooch Bahar. The houses are uncommonly good, the streets spacious, and the whole town has a very superior appearance. On the river are numerous boats of great burthen. Coarse cotton goods are the staple commodity, and this town furnishes a considerable part of the return cargo which is carried by the Bootan caravan annually from Rungpoor. (Turner, &c. &c.)\n\nMunnipora, (Manipura, the Town of Jewels).\u2014A town in the Birman empire, the capital of the province of Cassay. Lat. 24\u00b0. 20'. N. Long. 94\u00b0. 30'. E. The district in which this town is situated is also occasionally named the Muggaloo, or Meekly country, and is the nearest communication between the N. E. extremity of Bengal, and the N. W. quarter of the Birman territories, but the route has never yet been traversed by any European. An intercourse also subsists between this town and the province of Assam, as in 1794 the British detachment, which went to Gergong, the capital of Assam, saw there a body of cavalry which had arrived from Munnipora. This town was captured by the Birmans, in 1774, and has ever since remained tributary to them. (Wade, Symes, &c. &c.)\n\nMurichom.\u2014A village in Northern Hindustan, in the province of Bootan. Lat. 27\u00b0. 6'. N. Long. 89\u00b0. 28'. E. This place consists of only 24 houses, but they are of a superior structure to most in Bootan. They are built of stone with clay as a cement, of a square form, and the walls narrowing from the foundation to the top. The roof is supported clear of the walls, and is composed of fir boards placed lengthways on cross beams and joints of fir, and confined by large stones laid on the top. The lower part of the house accommodates hogs, cows, and other animals; and the first story is occupied by the family, to which they ascend by a ladder.\n\nMurichom stands on a space of level ground on the top of a mountain, and has much cultivated land in the vicinity. The farmers here level the ground; they cultivate on the sides of the hills by cutting it into shelves, forming beds of such a size as the slope will admit. The native cinnamon, known in Bengal cookery by the name of teezpaut, grows abundantly in the neighbourhood; and in the season there are plenty of strawberries, raspberries,\nand peaches. The country surrounding Murichom is much infested by a small fly, which draws blood with a proboscis, and leaves behind a small blister full of black contaminated blood, which inflames and causes much irritation. (Turner, &c.)\n\nMukutchope.\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, district of Mounghir, 90 miles S. by E. from Patna. Lat. 24\u00b0 23'. N. Long. 85\u00b0 45'. E.\n\nMustaphabad.\u2014A town in the northern quarter of the province of Delhi, 110 miles north from the city of Delhi. Lat. 30\u00b0 20'. N. Long. 76\u00b0 47'. E.\n\nThis is a town of considerable size, and like every other town and even village in this part of Hindoostan, is surrounded by a wall, as a defence against the attacks of predatory horse. The adjacent territory is so completely divided and subdivided into small independencies, that many of the small villages are governed by two chieftains; and this, before the British government was established, was nearly the condition of the country throughout the northern part of the Delhi province, between the Jumna and the Sutleje.\n\nMustaphanagur.\u2014See Condadilly.\n\nMutcheriuttae, (Matsyahata, the Fish Market).\u2014A town in the Nabob of Oude's territories, 40 miles N. by W. from Lucknow. Lat. 27\u00b0 22'. N. Long. 80\u00b0 40'. E.\n\nMuteodu.\u2014A small town in the Mysore Rajah's territories, containing about 200 houses. Lat. 13\u00b0 39'. N. Long. 76\u00b0 25'. E.\n\nAt this place there is a manufacture of the glass used for making the rings which the native women wear round their wrists. The glass is very coarse and opaque, and is of five colours, black, green, red, blue, and yellow\u2014the first being most in demand. All the materials are found in the neighbourhood, and great quantities of the glass is bought by the bangle (ring) makers to the westward. During the hot season soda is found in the form of a white efflorescence on the adjacent sandy fields. The European glass is considered by the ring manufacturers as useless as our cast iron; for neither of these substances are in a state upon which the fires of the natives have any effect. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nMutgur.\u2014A town in the British territories, in the province of Oude, district of Goraeepoor, 55 miles east from Fyzabad. Lat. 28\u00b0 45'. N. Long. 83\u00b0 7'.

E.\n\nMuzaffernagur.\u2014A district in the Nizam's territories, in the province of Beeder, situated about the 17th degree of north latitude.\n\nMuzaffernaour, (Mazafar-nagar).\u2014A town in the Nizam's territories, in the province of Beeder, the capital of a district of the same name, and situated 35 miles S. E. from Hyderabad. Lat. 17\u00b0. N. Long. 78\u00b0 25'. E.\n\nMuzaffernagur.\u2014A town in the province of Delhi, district of Merat, 60 miles distant N. E. from the city of Delhi. Lat. 29\u00b0 27'. N. Long. 77\u00b0 40'. E.\n\nMuzafferabad, (Mazafar-abad).\u2014An Afghan town and district, situated about the 34th degree of north latitude, in the country between Cashmere and the Indus. Lat. 34\u00b0 4'. N. Long. 72\u00b0 22'. E.\n\nThe town of Muzafferabad is small but populous, and the residence of a chief, entitled Sultan Mahomed. The face of the surrounding country exhibits a continued view of mountains, on the sides of which are seen patches of cultivated ground, and scattered hamlets of three or four cottages. The inhabitants of the district denominated Bombans, are Mahomedans of an Afghau tribe, and inimical to the Cashmerians. The Kishengunga River runs to the left of this town, with a course nearly S. W. and falls into the Jhylum,\namong the mountains at the head of the Punjab. A common mode of passing this river is on an inflated sheep or dogs' skin, which supporting the head and breast of the passenger, is impelled and guided by the motion of the legs. The road between Cashmere and this place, which is half way to the Indus, tends to the S. W. and leads over a country covered with mountains intersected by deep valleys. (Foster, 11th Register, &c.)\n\nMycondah.\u2014A town in the Mysore Rajah's territories, 138 miles N. N. W. from Seriapatam. Lat. 14\u00b0. 16'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 10'. E.\n\nThe fort of Mycondah is reckoned of importance, being situated at the entrance of a pass from the north-westward into the valley of Chitteldroog, which it is intended to defend. After leaving Mycondah the pass or defile commences, and continues rugged and jungly for four or five miles, the road ascending all the way towards Chitteldroog. (Moor, &c.)\n\nMydan, (Maidan).\u2014A small Afghan district in the province of Kabul, situated between the 33d and 34th degrees of north latitude. In the reign of the Emperor Akbar the Hazarchi tribe, Maidani, occupied this extensive district, which was then rated at 2000 cavalry, and a revenue of 1,606,799 dams.\n\nMyer.\u2014A town in the province of Allahabad, 50 miles S. S. E. from Callinger. Lat. 24\u00b0. 21'. N. Long. 80\u00b0. 50'. E.\n\nMyunsing, (Myman Singh).\u2014A district in the province of Bengal, situated principally between the 24th and 25th degrees of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by the Garrow Mountains and the district of Rungpoor; to the south by Dacca Jalalpoor; on the east it has Silhet and Tipperah; and on the west Ranjeshy and Dinagepoor. This district is of more recent formation than the adjacent ones, on which account it underwent no separate mensuration in 1784. It is intersected by the great River Brahmapootra, into which flow innumerable smaller streams, and the face of the country being very low and flat, it is, during the height of the rains, nearly submerged by the rising of the waters. The soil is extremely fertile and productive, particularly in rice, which is the staple commodity; but a considerable proportion of the district is still covered with jungle, and but thinly inhabited, compared with the more central divisions of Bengal. The chief town is Bygonbary, which is the residence of the judge and collector, who are subordinate to the Dacca court of circuit.\n\nThe result of the investigation ordered by the Marquis Wellesley, in 1801, proved that this district contained 600,000 inhabitants, half of whom were Hindoos, and the other half Mahomedans, and that the zemindars profit on the lands was equal to 20 per cent, per annum.\n\nMyo Isle.\u2014A small island situated in the Molucca passage, which separates Celebes and Giloli. Lat. 1\u00b0. 23'. N. Long. 126\u00b0. 15'. E. This island was inhabited while the Portuguese held the Moluccas; but the Dutch expelled the inhabitants, lest it should become convenient for the smuggling of spices.\n\nMysol Isle.\u2014An island in the Eastern Sea, situated about the second degree of south latitude, midway between the large islands of Ceram and Papua. In length it may be estimated at 50 miles, by 15 the average breadth.\n\nOn the east coast of Mysol is the harbour of Efbe formed by a small island of the same name, on which fresh water may be procured in great abundance, without any risk from the winds, as the harbour is perfectly land-locked. Like the rest of the islands east of the Molucca passage, it is inhabited by Mahomedans, commonly called Malays, on the sea-coast; and in the interior by the original natives, or horaforas. The chiefs of the former are denominated rajahs, which is a noted Hindoo title.\nThe birds of paradise come at certain seasons of the year in flocks from the eastward, and settling on the trees are caught with birdlime. The bodies are afterwards dried with the feathers on, as they are seen in Europe. The black loory, which is a very scarce bird, may also occasionally be purchased here. The other articles of the trifling export commerce carried on here are, biche de mar, missoy bark, ambergris, pearls, pearl-oyster shells, and slaves; the imports are coarse piece goods, cutlery, beads, iron in bars, china-ware, looking-glasses, and brass wire. The industrious Chinese settled at Amboyna are the principal traders, but the whole amount is very insignificant. (Forrest, Labillardiere, &c.)\n\nMYSORE, (Mahesasura).\n\nA large province in the south of India, situated principally between the 11th and 15th degrees of north latitude, and surrounded by the British territories under the Madras Presidency. In length it may be estimated at 210 miles, by 140 the average breadth.\n\nThe whole of this country is enclosed by the eastern and western Ghauts, and consists of a high table land nearly 3000 feet above the level of the sea, from which rise many lofty hills, and clusters of hills, containing the sources of almost all the rivers that fertilize the south of India. The climate in this elevated region is temperate and healthy to a degree unknown in any other tract of the like extent within the tropics. The monsoons, or boisterous periodical rains, which at different seasons deluge the coasts of Coromandel and Malabar, have their force broken by the Ghauts, or mountains, and from either side extend into the interior provinces in frequent showers, which, though sometimes heavy, are seldom of long continuance, and preserve both the temperature of the climate and the verdure of the country throughout the year. The principal rivers are, the Cavery, the Toombuddra, the Vedawati, the Bhadri, the Arkanati, the Penar, Palar, and Panaur; but, except the Cavery, none of these rivers attain to any magnitude, until they quit the limits of the province.\n\nTo enter the Mysore country there are several passes, such as the Muglee, the Palicaud, the Amboor, the Changama, and the Attoor; but those passes, while they facilitated the operations of Hyder, when invading the Carnatic from the Barumahal valley, were not attended with any similar advantages to the invaders of his country; for as the only roads practicable united in the Palicaud Pass which leads to Oossoor, he had but one entrance into the Mysore country to defend.\n\nThe dominions of the Mysore Rajah are at present divided into three great districts, or subayenas, called the Patana, the Nagara, and the Chatrakal Subayenas. The Patana district is by far the largest, and alone contains a greater extent of territory than was originally subject to the Mysore Rajah\u2019s family. It comprehends 91 districts, and is under the immediate inspection of the Dewan, or prime minister. In addition to this territory, since their connexion with the British, they have acquired the Chatrakal Subayena, containing 13 districts, and the Nagara, containing 19, each of which are superintended by a soubahdar.\n\nFrom the remains of hedges, and other signs, the Mysore province appears at some former, remote period, to have been in a much higher state of cultivation than it at present exhibits, although rapidly recovering. In this province, when land is once brought into cultivation for rice, it is universally considered as having arrived at the highest possible degree of improvement, and all attempts to render it more productive by a succession of crops neglected as superfluous. Throughout India generally there are three modes of sowing the\nseed of rice, from whence proceed three modes of cultivation. In the first way, the seed is sown dry on the fields that are to bring it to maturity, which is called dry-seed cultivation. In the second, the seed is made to vegetate before it is sown, and the field, when fitted to receive it, is converted to a puddle; this is called sprouted cultivation. In the third kind of cultivation, the seed is sown very thick in a small plot of ground; and when it has shot up a foot high, the young rice is transplanted into the fields where it is to ripen; this is called cultivating by transplantation. The higher fields are cultivated after the dry-seed manner of sowing, the lower grounds are reserved for the sprouted and transplanted cultivations. These various modes of cultivating rice give the farmer a great advantage, as by dividing the labour over a great part of the year, fewer hands and less stock are required to till the same extent of ground, than if there was one seed-time and one harvest.\n\nBesides rice, the lands produce the following articles; the chicadu, the dod'ada, the phaseolus mango, the dolichos catsjang, the sesamum orientale, and the sugar-cane, for which a black clay is reckoned the best soil. The crop of raggy, or cynosurus corocanus, is by far the most important of any raised on the dry field, and supplies all the lower ranks of society with their common food. The ricinus palma Christi is cultivated, and produces abundance of castor oil, which is used for the lamp, given to milch buffaloes, and for a variety of other purposes. In the sugar cultivation, the West India planters appear to have a decided advantage over those of Hindostan in climate, soil, carriage, and skill, both in agriculture and mechanics; but the enormous price of labour, compared with that of Hindostan, brings them nearer an equality.\n\nThe betel-leaf tree thrives best in low grounds, where it can have a supply of water, which, at particular seasons, is raised from the reservoirs by means of machines, called Yatams. About Colar the poppy is plentifully cultivated, both for making opium, and on account of the seed, which is much used in the sweet cakes that are eaten by the higher ranks of natives. Tobacco is not generally raised, and is reckoned inferior to that which comes from the low country. The cocoa nut palm in this province begins to produce when seven or eight years old, and lives so long, that its duration, among such bad chronologists as the natives, cannot readily be ascertained. The young trees, of a good quality, will give 100 nuts annually, and they come forward at all seasons of the year.\n\nThe English use but one name for the juices of all the different palm trees in India, and call them toddy, which seems to be a corruption of tari, the Mahommedan name for the juice of the palmira, or borassus flabelliformis. The natives have distinct names for each kind of juice, in the qualities of which there is a considerable difference. The grass roots are here of great length; and, being very tenacious of life, sprout at every joint, and of course are difficult to remove. Owing also to the extreme imperfection of their instruments, and want of strength in their cattle, the fields in this province are very imperfectly cleaned. After six or eight ploughings in all directions, numerous small bushes remain as erect as before the labour commenced, while the plough has not penetrated three inches deep. The latter has neither coulter nor mould board, to divide and turn over the soil.\n\nIn Mysore considerable attention is paid to the manuring of the soil. Every farmer collects a heap from the dung and litter of his cattle, intermixed with the ashes and soil of their houses; but they do not employ the soil of towns. Two crops of rice are seldom taken from the same field in one year. In some parts of Mysore the first quality of\nland will produce from 47 to 49 bushels; the second quality, from 35 to 42; and the third quality, from 17 to 24 bushels of rice. It is usually preserved in the husk, and will keep two years without deterioration, and four without being unfit for use.\n\nIn India it is a commonly received opinion, that when the supply of water is adequate, ground can never be in such good heart as when regularly cultivated by a succession of rice crops. In all old reservoirs a great part is filled up by the deposition from the water; and, when a village has been deserted for some time, unless the mound breaks down, the tanks in general become quite obliterated. In many parts of the Mysore the wells contain what the natives call salt water; at Bangalore there are several. Some of them are situated very near wells that are perfectly fresh, which is to be accounted for from the vertical position of the strata.\n\nThe farmers in this province have not usually long leases, but it is not usual to change the tenant so long as he pays the rent. When a farmer runs away for arrears of rent or oppression, and goes into the district of another amildar, it is not customary, in any native government, to give him up; which is a considerable check on arbitrary conduct, as a very unreasonable amildar would soon be deserted.\n\nThe cattle chiefly bred in the neighbourhood of Seringapatam are cows, buffaloes, sheep, and the long-legged goat. The natives of this country, and of India generally, seldom use butter in the manner Europeans do, but prefer what is called ghee, not only because it keeps better, but also on account of its having more taste and smell. In order to collect a quantity sufficient for making ghee, the butter is often kept two or three days, which, in a warm climate, renders it rancid. After a sufficient quantity has been collected, it is melted in an earthen pot, and boiled until all the water has evaporated, when it is poured into pots, and kept for use.\n\nThe native breed of horses here, as in most parts of India, is a small, ill-shaped, vicious poney, although considerable pains were taken, by Hyder and Tippoo, to introduce a better kind, but without success, and their cavalry continued always very ill-mounted. Above the Ghaunts asses are a sort of cattle very much used. The breed is very small, no pains being taken to improve it, or to keep it from growing worse; and the natives never use the milk. Swine were once very common in the Mysore, but Tippoo succeeded in banishing them from the neighbourhood of the capital. The sheep are of three varieties as to colour\u2014red, black, and white.\n\nThis province throughout abounds in iron ore, which is worked by the natives in a very slovenly manner. At the iron works near Chinnarayan Durga, the workmen procure from the ore about 47 per cent. of malleable iron; but, as usual in India, it is very impure. At the smelting-house the buildings are so mean, that they go for nothing in the expense; and at the beginning of the season are put up by the workmen in the course of a day.\n\nThe three large divisions of this province, named Patana, Nagara, and Chatrakal, are under the inspection of an officer of rank, or soubahdar. Each district is managed by an amildar, who is an officer of justice, police, and revenue, but his authority is very limited. These amildars have under them a sufficient number of accountants, who, in the Karnataca language, are called parputties; and the villages under them are managed by gaudas and shanabogas, called by the Mahommedans potalis and ennums, which two offices are properly hereditary. The gauda is the representative of the amildar, and the shanaboga, of the village accountant. The amildars, parputties, and shanabogas are al-\nmost universally Brahmins; the gaudas are all Sudras.\n\nThe Mysore, upon the whole, is but thinly inhabited, and not to be compared to Bengal, or the adjacent provinces under the British government. In consequence of incessant wars and calamities, prior to the final conquest, in 1799, many districts, formerly well peopled, do not exhibit a vestige of a human being. In 1761 it was ravaged by Bunee Visajee Pundit; by Madhurrow in 1765, 1767, and 1770; by Trimbuc Row in 1771; by Ragoonanth Row in 1774; by Hurry Punt Phurkia in 1776 and 1786; and lastly, in 1791 and 1792, it sustained most merciless ravages from the troops of Purseram Bhow.\n\nIn 1799, when the conquest of Mysore was finally achieved by the army under General Harris, the new administration, established by the British government, commenced its proceedings by proclaiming an unqualified remission of all balances of revenue, and the restoration of the ancient Hindoo rate of assessment on the lands. In 1804 the number of families in the Mysore Rajah's territories amounted to 482,612, and the inhabitants to 2,171,754. Of these families there does not appear to have been more than 17,900 of the Mahomedan religion, which is very extraordinary, considering that it had been 40 years the faith of their sovereigns. The Brahmin families were 25,370; the Lingait, 72,637; and the Jain, 2063.\n\nIn 1804 the gross revenue of the Mysore Rajah's state was 2,581,550 pagodas. Accounts in this province are kept in canterraya pagodas, and the seer is the standard of weight. Cloth and timber are usually measured by the purchaser's cubit, which may be considered in all nations as 18 inches on the average. Notwithstanding the arbitrary power of the last sultan, Tippoo, he was never able to establish an uniformity of weights and measures. In this country, and through India generally, a great deal of bullion is lost to the world by being buried, as, when the owners get old and stupidified, they forget where their treasures are hidden; and sometimes, when they do know, die without divulging the secret.\n\nMysore having submitted to the Mahomedan yoke at a very recent period, compared with the rest of Hindostan, retains the primitive Hindoo manners and customs in considerable purity. From persons of this faith information is best collected where a considerable number of them are assembled together; when a few are present, they are afraid of reflections from those who are absent; and in general the Hindoos are rather inclined to have matters of business publicly discussed.\n\nIn this country the person who receives charity is always considered of higher rank than the donor; but by charity must be understood something given to a person asking for it in the name of God, as having dedicated himself to a religious life. When sick, Hindoos often make a vow to subsist by begging for a certain number of days after they recover.\n\nWhen two parties in a village have a dispute, one of them very frequently has recourse to an expedient by which they both suffer; and this is the killing of a jack-ass in the streets, which would ensure the immediate desolation of the place, where no Hindoo would sojourn another night, unless by compulsion. Even the adversaries of the party who killed the ass would think themselves bound in honour to fly. The natives have also recourse to this remedy when they fancy themselves oppressed by government in matters relating to caste. The monkies and squirrels are here very destructive; but it is reckoned criminal to kill them. The proprietors of gardens used formerly to hire a particular class of men, who took these animals in nets, and then, by\nstealth, conveyed into the gardens of some distant village; but, as the people there had recourse to the same means of riddance, all parties became tired of the practice.\n\nThe washerman of every village, whose function is hereditary, washes all the farmers' cloths; and, according to the number of persons in each family, receives a regulated proportion of the crop. They also wash the clothes of the panchanga, or village astrologer, who (they say), in return, visits them occasionally, and tells them some lies; for, that he is never at the trouble of predicting the truth, except to those who are rich. The Whallia caste in this province are considered as the very lowest, yet they are very desirous of keeping up the purity of the breed, and never marry but with the daughters of families, with whose descent, from long vicinity, they are well acquainted. Everywhere in Mysore and Karnata, the palanqueen bearers are of Telinga origin. Their hereditary chiefs are called Pedda Bui; which appellation, among the Europeans at Madras, is bestowed on the head-bearer of every gentleman's set. The dress of the females in Karnata is very becoming, and they possess in general fine forms. In the villages near Seringapatam a great proportion of the farmers eat pork; but, although the River Cavery abounds with fish, very few are caught by the natives, who are not partial to this species of food. In this province, as in Hindostan, generally the hour consists of the 60th part of a day, or 24 minutes, and the natives compute distances by an hour's travelling, called at Madras a Malabar mile.\n\nThe Hindoos seldom erect magnificent private dwellings; and the Mahommedan chiefs under Tippoo were too uncertain of their property to lay out much on buildings. Everything they acquired was, in general, immediately expended on dress, equipage, and amusement, which accounts for there being actually no private buildings in Mysore of any grandeur.\n\nOwing to the custom of polygamy, very few of the females in this country live in a state of celibacy, except young widows of high caste, who cannot marry again. These, however, are numerous, as matches betwixt old men and mere children are very frequent. The comfort of having children is, in general, all the pleasure that married women of high rank enjoy in India. Where polygamy prevails, love is but little known; or if it does possess a man, he is usually captivated by some artful dancing girl, and not by any of his wives. In general a man may marry as many wives as he can maintain or procure; but here the first is not very difficult, the women being extremely industrious, both in the field and in spinning. With a few exceptions, the females are not strictly confined; but, on marriage, they adopt the religious forms of their husband. Among some castes widows cannot marry again, and were expected to burn themselves alive with their husbands; but this practice is now become obsolete. In every part of India, a man's marrying his uncle's daughter is looked upon as incestuous.\n\nThe subdivision of caste throughout Hindostan is infinite. The Brahmins assert, that they are divided into at least 2000 tribes, which never intermarry, although permitted to do so without infringing their caste. In Mysore the Brahmins are divided into three principal sects; the Smartal, the Sri Vaishnavam, and the Madral. The Nairs of Malabar, like the Khayastas of Bengal, are of the highest class of Sudras. A great majority of the Hindoo castes are allowed by their religion to eat animal food, and a considerable number to drink spirituous liquors.\n\nIn the country around Seringapatam, the division of the people into what are called the right and left hand sides, is productive of consi-\nderable effect. The first comprehends nine castes, and the last 18. The circumstances that add dignity to a caste in this country are\u2014its being restricted from the pleasures of the table; the following of no useful employment; and being dedicated to what are here called piety and learning. Almost every man endeavours to assume as much as possible the appearance of these perfections; and among the people of this country a hypocritical cant is a very prevailing fashion.\n\nThe males of the Mysore Rajah's family are said to be divided into two great branches\u2014the Rajah Bundas, and the Collalays, who intermarry. The head of the first is the curtur, or sovereign; and of the last the delawai. Some of the males of each family are of Vishnu's side, and some of them of Siva's; but none wear the linga, and all acknowledge the Brahmins as their goorooos (priests). The curtur immediately on ascending the throne, whatever religion he may have been educated in, always adopts the ceremonies at least of the Sri Vaishnanim. On the contrary, the ladies of both families wear the linga, reject the authority of the Brahmins, and are under the spiritual guidance of the Jangamas. This arrangement among other nations would be considered extraordinary, but among the Hindoos is not uncommon.\n\nAmong the Hindoos a man is reckoned good who prays constantly, bestows great alms on religious mendicants, and who makes tanks, reservoirs, choultries, and gardens. To be absorbed into the substance of their gods, is supposed, by the Hindoos, to be the greatest possible felicity, and only happens to particular favourites. The rich among the lower castes procure absolution, by giving charity to the Brahmins; the poor must trust to the mercy of God.\n\nAbout Silagutta, the principal object of worship with the Morasa tribe is an image called Cala Bhai-\n\nrava, which signifies the black dog; and, occasionally, at this temple, a singular sacrifice is made. When a woman is from 15 to 20 years of age, and has borne some children, terrified lest the angry deity should deprive her of her infants, she goes to the temple, and, as an offering to appease his wrath, she cuts off one or two of the fingers of her right hand.\n\nWhen a new village is founded, it is customary, in some parts of the country, to place a large stone in or near the village, which is considered as representing the god of the village; and wherever a stream is found by its windings to run counter to the general direction of the river it belongs to, it is considered by the Hindoos as holy, and to both sacrifices are offered.\n\nThe Mysore Rajah's family is supposed to have had its origin from the Yadava tribe, which boasts among its eminent characters Krishna, the celebrated Hindoo Apollo, and at a remote period had its residence in the vicinity of Dwaraca, in the Gujrat Peninsula. The first sovereign on record is Cham Raj, who ascended the throne in A.D. 1507; but he may be considered as having been merely a wadeyar, or governor of a small district.\n\nTim Raj reigned in 1548, and added some small territories to his dominions.\n\nHere Cham Raj reigned in 1571, and died in 1576. He was succeeded by Betad Wadeyar, his cousin, who was supplanted in his government by his younger brother, Raj Wadeyar. This sovereign appears to have been the greatest conqueror of the Mysore family, and more than doubled the extent of his dominions. In 1610 he acquired the important fortress of Scringapatam, from the viceroy, on the part of the falling dynasty of Bijanagar. He was succeeded by his grandson,\n\nCham Raj, who added considerably to the Mysore territories, and died in 1637.\nImmadee Raj, the posthumous son of Raj Wadyar, was his successor, and was poisoned at the expiration of a year by his dalawai, or prime minister.\n\nCanty Revy Narsa Raj, the son of Betad Cham Raj Wadeyar, was the next sovereign of Mysore, and was the first prince who established a mint, and coined hoons (pagodas) and tanams, still called after his name. He reigned from 1639 to 1659.\n\nDud Deo Ray was his successor, and reigned until 1672, during which interval he made many conquests from the neighbouring Wadeyars and Naiks.\n\nChick Deo Raj ascended the throne in 1672, and died in 1704. This prince completed the subjugation of the turbulent Wadeyars, made a new land assessment, which, in a great measure, still subsists, and destroyed the Jungum priests. His prime minister for 14 years was a Jain Pundit. Among other places he acquired Bangaloor by purchase.\n\nCanty Raj, son of the last sovereign, ascended the throne in 1704. Having been born deaf and dumb, he was surnamed Mook Arsoo, the Dumb Sovereign. In this reign began the influence of the Dalawais, or ministers, which ever after kept the rajas as mere pageants. He died in 1714, and was succeeded by\n\nDud Kishen Raj, whose dalawai was Deo Raj. He died in 1731, and was succeeded by Cham Raj, whose chief ministers were Deo Raj and Nunseraj. They deposed and imprisoned him in 1734, and placed on the throne\n\nChick Kishen Raj, whose ministers were Deo Raj and the younger Nunseraj, who undertook the long siege of Trichinopoly, where he was baffled by Major Lawrence. In this reign appeared Hyder Ali Khan, who afterwards became supreme monarch of Mysore, and many adjacent provinces. He was 27 years of age before he entered the military service, in which he after made so distinguished a figure, and was through life unable either to read or write. This happened in 1749; but it was A.D. 1755 before he had his first separate command, when he was sent by the Dalawai Nunseraj to subdue Dindigul, which he effected.\n\nIn 1760 Hyder attained the sovereign authority, having banished Nunseraj, his patron, and retaining the rajah as a pageant. The same year he was expelled from Seringapatam by his own Dewan Kundee Row; but in 1761 he re-instated himself, and ever after held the government with a firm hand. In 1763 he conquered Bednore, Soonda, and Canara; and, in 1766, Calicut, and the greater part of Malabar. This year the nominal rajah, Chick Kishen Deo Raj Wadeyar died, when Hyder ordered his eldest son to be installed as his successor with the usual formalities. In 1771 Hyder was totally defeated by Madhurow the Peshwa of the Mahattas, but afterwards recovered his power and possessions. In 1780 he invaded the lower Carnatic, which he desolated with fire and sword, carrying his ravages to the gates of Madras. By the firmness and exertions of Mr. Hastings, and the military talents of Sir Eyre Coote, his progress was arrested; but being powerfully assisted by the French, he was enabled to carry on an indecisive warfare until the 9th of December, 1782, when he died, leaving his throne to his son Tippoo, who had already established his reputation as a general.\n\nTippoo Sultan prosecuted the war until the 11th of March, 1784, when by the peace in Europe being deprived of the co-operation of his French allies, he concluded a treaty on honourable terms. From this date he was occupied in harassing and subduing his neighbours until 1790, when he made an unprovoked attack on the Rajah of Travancor, who called on the British government for the assistance stipulated by treaties. A war commenced in consequence, which terminated on the\n16th of March, 1792, in a peace concluded by Lord Cornwallis under the walls of Seringapatam, which deprived him of one half of his dominions, and rendered the remainder of uncertain tenure. To recover his lost power, and gratify his hatred to the British, he solicited the alliance of the French Republic, and of Zemman Shah, and endeavoured to excite disaffection and rebellion among the Mahommedan inhabitants of the British provinces. A second war ensued, which for him had a fatal conclusion. On the 4th of May, 1799, Seringapatam, his capital, was stormed by the British army under General Harris, when he fell by an unknown hand, and with him terminated the Mahommedan Mysore dynasty, having lasted 38 years.\n\nOn the 22d of June, 1799, the British government raised to the throne Maha Rajah Krishna Udayer (then six years of age), a legitimate descendant of the ancient Mysore family, which had been superseded by that of Hyder. By a subsidiary treaty concluded with him on the 8th of July, it was stipulated, that the Company should maintain a military force for the defence of Mysore, against all external enemies; and that the rajah should pay an annual subsidy of seven lacks of pagodas for its support. In extraordinary cases of warfare the expenses to be amicably arranged, and the friends and enemies of the one to be considered in the same relation to the other. Since that period the inhabitants of Mysore have been undisturbed by foreign invasion, or internal dissension; and, under the able management of the Rajahs Dewan Purneah, agriculture has been encouraged, and the population of the country increased. (F. Buchanan, Wilks, Dirom, Malcolm, Lord Valentia, Treaties, &c.)\n\nMysory, (or Shoutin's Isle).\u2014An island in the Eastern Seas, situated to the north of the great bay, in the Island of Papua, or New Guinea, about the first degree of south latitude, and one day's sail distant from Dong Harbour. In length it may be estimated at 75 miles, by 20 the average breadth. The name of this island has undergone several changes, as it was originally named Horn Island; but the crews of Shoutens and of the Maries ships, in 1616, changed its appellation to Shoutens' Isle. The name by which it is known to the natives of the adjacent islands is Mysory.\n\nRespecting this island our information is very scanty. Captain Forrest, from the narratives of the Malays, describes it as well inhabited, under the government of rajahs, and very productive of calavances.\n\nN.\n\nNaded.\u2014A town in the Deccan, situated on the Cauvery River, about 100 miles above Hyderbad, the Nizami's capital. It is supposed that Gooroo Govind, the tenth and martial high priest of the Seiks, died here A.D. 1708.\n\nNadone, (Nadon).\u2014This is the principal town in the Kangrah country, in the province of Lahore, and is situated on the east side of the Be-yah, 120 miles E. by N. from the city of Lahore. Lat. 31\u00b0.59'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 47'. E.\n\nThe Nadone District is a mountainous tract of country, which borders on the Punjab of the Lahore province, situated N.W. from Serinagur, and S. E. from Jamboc, and to the westward is bounded by the Seik territories. The present Rajah of Nadone Sansar Chund is a chief of considerable respectability, and his territory naturally strong; it was, notwithstanding, overrun by the Ghourkali Rajah of Nepaul's forces, who, in 1806, occupied the town. (Malcolm, Foster, &c.)\n\nNagal, (Nagalaya, abounding in Snakes).\u2014A town in the province of Delhi, situated on the east side of\nthe Ganges, 18 miles south from Hurdwar. Lat. 29\u00b0. 43'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 10'. E.\n\nNAGAMANGALAM.\u2014A large square mud fort in the Mysore Rajah's territories, 29 miles north from Serinapatanam, containing a square citadel in its centre. Lat. 12\u00b0. 49'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 57'. E. In the inner fort are two square temples, some other religious buildings, and public offices, besides some large granaries\u2014all in ruins. The town and all these buildings are said to have been erected, about 600 years ago, by a prince named Jagadeva Raya, of the same family with the present Mysore Rajah. Before the invasion of Pusseram Bhow it contained 1500 houses, which were in consequence reduced to 300; but the place is recovering rapidly.\n\nNAGHERY, (Nagari.)\u2014A town in the Carnatic, 48 miles N.W. by W. from Madras. Lat. 13\u00b0. 19'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 45'. E.\n\nNAGJERY.\u2014A town in the Maharratta territories, in the province of Khandesh, 32 miles W. by N. from Boorhanpoor. Lat. 21\u00b0. 25'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 50'. E.\n\nNAGNE.\u2014A small river in the Gujrat Peninsula, which rises in a range of hills 14 miles to the S.E. of Lawria, passes the city of Noanagur, and afterwards falls into the shallow part of the Gulf of Cutch, here named the Run. The name of this river is derived from a fabulous traditionary story of an enormous nag, or snake, which dwelt in a tank among the hills; and, endeavouring to escape from his enemies, burst the bank, and formed the channel of the river. Its waters are esteemed by the natives as having an excellent quality in promoting the dying of cloth.\n\nNAGORBUSSY, (Nagarabashi.)\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, district of Tirhoot, 40 miles N.E. from Patna.

E.\n\nFrom this quarter a very extensive export of piece goods to the eastward, to the Isles of France, and to America. The imports from the eastward are pepper, betel nut, benzoin, sugar, and gallingal; from Bengal borax, cummin seeds, ginger, long pepper, wheat, and sugar; from Ceylon large supplies of betel nut, palmirahs, arrack, chanks, and coffee; from Penang pepper, betel nut, camphor, iron, and sugar.\n\nThe total value of the imports from places beyond the territories of Madras, from the 1st of May, 1811, to the 30th of April, 1812, was 903,171 rupees, viz.\n\n| From America | - - - - | 29,175 |\n| Calcutta     | - - - - | 52,553 |\n| Bombay       | - - - - | 7,140 |\n| Ceylon       | - - - - | 207,871 |\n| Eastward     | - - - - | 329,813 |\n| Muscat       | - - - - | 5,545 |\n| Pegue        | - - - - | 3,339 |\n| Prince of Wales's Island | - - - - | 171,471 |\n| Surat        | - - - - | 1,036 |\n| Travancor    | - - - - | 1,589 |\n| Various places | - - - - | 93,639 |\n\nArcot rupees 903,171\n\nThe total value of the exports to places beyond the territories of the Madras government, during the above period, was 933,006 rupees, viz.\n\n| To America | - - - - | 45,316 |\n| Batavia    | - - - - | 3,929 |\n| Calcutta   | - - - - | 39,294 |\n| Ceylon     | - - - - | 336,739 |\n| China      | - - - - | 1,859 |\n| Eastward   | - - - - | 96,831 |\n| Isle of France | - - - - | 4,030 |\n| Pegue      | - - - - | 1,000 |\n| Prince of Wales's Island | - - - - | 313,080 |\n| Various places | - - - - | 90,928 |\n\nArcot rupees 933,006\n\nIn the course of the above period 1223 vessels and craft, measuring 38,868 tons, arrived, and 1798 ditto,\nNAGPOOR.\n\nmeasuring 50,245 tons, departed. (Parliamentary Reports, &c.)\n\nNagore.\u2014A Rajpoot district in the eastern quarter of the province of Ajmeer, situated principally between the 26th and 27th degrees of north latitude. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"Hadowty, called also sircar Nagore, is inhabited by the Hadch tribe. It contains 31 mahals, measurement 837,450 beegahs; revenue 40,389,830 dams. Seyurghal 308,051 dams. This sircar furnishes 4500 cavalry, and 22,000 infantry.\"\n\nWe know very little of this district in modern times, except that it is subdivided among a number of petty chiefs, occasionally acknowledging the supremacy of the Jeynagar Rajah, and always from their internal dissensions liable to the depredations of the Maharattas. A Rajah of Nagore is mentioned in 1542, as having been defeated by Shere Khan the Afghan, who expelled Humayoon.\n\nNagore.\u2014A Rajpoot town in the province of Ajmeer, 45 miles N. W. from the city of Ajmeer. Lat. 27\u00b0. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 15'. E.\n\nNagore.\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Birbhoon, 63 miles W. S. W. from Moorshedabad. Lat. 23\u00b0. 56'. N. Long. 87\u00b0. 20'. E. There is a hot well at a short distance to the south of Nagore, at a place named Becassore. Nagore is mentioned as a Mahommadan fortress, and the capital of the Birbhoon district, so early as A.D. 1244.\n\nNagorecote.\u2014See Cote Kaungrah.\n\nNagpoor, (Chuta).\u2014A district in the southern extremity of the Bahar province, situated principally between the 22d and 23d degrees of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by Ramgur and Palamow; to the south by the independent district of Gangpoor; to the east it has Ramgur and Singhboon; and to the west Palamow and Jushpoor. The ancient Hindoo province of Gundwana borders this district on the southern, eastern, and western quarters; and the district was probably one of the latest conquests effected by the Mahommadans in this part of Hindostan\u2014a very great proportion of the inhabitants are consequently of the old Hindoo persuasion.\n\nThe surface of the country is hilly, but not mountainous, and generally much covered with jungle. Under the Mogul government it was long a frontier government, but partially subdued and occupied by native zemindars, who were little interfered with so long as they paid the revenue stipulated. It still continues one of the wildest and least cultivated of the Company's districts, and from its want of inland navigation will probably never be a country of much export. Like other hilly districts, Chuta Nagpoor contains the sources of many streams, but they attain to no magnitude until they quit its limits. The soil is in many parts highly impregnated with iron, which might be procured in considerable quantities, but can be imported from Europe at so moderate an expense, that its production here is no object. This district is distinguished by the term chuta (little), to distinguish it from the other Napoor possessed by the Bhoonslah Maharatta family. The name Nagpoor indicates that in the opinion of the natives the territory contains diamonds.\n\nNagpoor, (Nagapura, the Town of Serpents).\u2014A large town in the province of Gundwana, and the capital of the territories of the Nagpoor Maharattas. Lat. 21\u00b0. 9'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 45'. E. It has been generally supposed that this city is the capital of Berar, but this is a mistake; the inhabitants of Nagpoor considering Berar as an adjoining province, the capital of which is Ellichpoor.\n\nThis capital of the Eastern Maharattas is a city of modern date, and though very extensive and populous, is meanly built\u2014the streets being narrow and filthy, and the houses covered with tiles. When\nRagojee Bhoonslah fixed here the seat of government; it was an insignificant village, which he surrounded with a rampart; but still it cannot be described as a fortified town, or capable of resisting an enemy even for a single day. It stands on a fine high plain, which is fertile and well cultivated, and bounded by hills of moderate height to the N. W. and S. The Nag Nuddy, a rivulet running to the southward, communicates the name of the town. The general appearance of the country to the north is that of a forest, with villages and small towns thinly scattered over it. Including the suburbs the population has been estimated at 80,000 inhabitants.\n\nThe Maharatta Rajahs of Nagpoor being descended from the line of Serajee, pretend to a superiority over the Poonah family, although the first sovereign was Ragojee Bhoonslah, a general in the service of the Peshwa, and dispatched by him to effect the conquest of this country about the year 1740. He was succeeded by his son Janojee, who died A.D. 1772. His successor, in 1774, after many contests with the different members of his family, was his nephew, Ragojee Bhoonslah, under the regency of his father, Madhajee Bhoonslah. The latter died many years ago, but the former still continues on the throne.\n\nThe policy of this state has, in general, been to interfere as little as possible with the contests of the neighbouring potentates, and for many years its internal dissensions furnished its sovereigns with sufficient occupation. Their territories being of great extent, wild, and desolate, presented many obstacles, and few temptations to the cupidity of their neighbours; they consequently remained for many years exempt from external warfare, until, in 1803, the Nagpoor Rajah was induced to join Dowlet Row Sindia in a confederacy against the British government. The signal defeats they sustained from General Wellesley at Assye and Argaum, soon compelled the former to sue most urgently for peace, which was granted on the 17th Dec. 1803, when a treaty of peace was concluded by General Wellesley on the part of the British government, and Jeswunt Row Ramchunder on the part of Ragojee Bhoonslah; by the conditions of which the latter ceded the province of Cuttack, including the port and district of Balasore. By this treaty he likewise ceded all the territory of which he collected the revenue in conjunction with the Nizam, and fixed his western frontier at the River Wurda, from where it issues in the Injardy Hills, to its junction with the Godavery. The hills on which the forts of Gawelghur and Nerallah stand, with a contiguous district to the amount of four lacks of rupees, to remain with the rajah; but every thing else south of the Injardy Hills, and west of the Wurda, to be ceded to the British and their allies. On any dispute arising the British engaged to mediate impartially between the Nizam and the Rajah, and the latter agreed never to receive any European into his service without the consent of the British government. During the war possession had been taken of the districts of Sumbhulpoor and Patna in the province of Gundwana; but in consequence of the amicable relations subsisting between the states they were restored in 1806; and, in 1809, the rajah again experienced the benefit of the British alliance, by the powerful assistance afforded him against Ameer Khan and his horde of depredators.\n\nThe dominions of this prince still occupy a very extensive region, and comprehend great part of the ancient Hindoo province of Gundwana. In their utmost dimensions they border on Bengal, the Northern Circars, and the Nizam\u2019s territories in the Deccan; but a large proportion of the country never having been perfectly subdued, pays no tribute, unless when compelled by the presence\nof an army; and the more inaccessible parts pay no revenue whatever. The districts more immediately occupied by the subjects of the Nagpoor Rajah, are those in the vicinity of his capital\u2014Chooteesghur, Rutunpoor, and Chandah; together with several strong fortresses, such as Gavelghur and Narnallah, in the Berar province.\n\nTravelling distance from Hyderabad, 321 miles; from Oojain, 340; from Poonah, 486; from Delhi, 631; from Madras, 673; from Calcutta, 723; and from Bombay, 577 miles. (Lekie, Rennel, Treaties, &c. &c.)\n\nNahry Sankar.\u2014A province in Tibet, bounded on the south by the Himalaya ridge of mountains, having the Lahdack country to the N.E. Respecting this region very little is known, but it is described as producing sulphur and quicksilver among the mountains, and borax in the stagnated lakes of the low countries. The sources of many of the rivers of Hindostan were formerly supposed to exist in this region, but this notion has been exploded since that of the Ganges was discovered to issue on the south of the great Himalaya chain.\n\nNahn, (Nakan).\u2014A district on the N.E. frontier of the Delhi province, being partly situated in that province, and partly in Serinagur, having the River Junna for its eastern boundary, which here in the month of March is as wide as the Ganges in the same latitude.\n\nThe whole of this country may be described as woody and mountainous. In the neighbourhood of the town of Nahn the country is interspersed with low hills, which frequently open into extensive wastes overgrown with wood, and which do not appear to have ever been subjected to cultivation. From Nahn to Bellaspoor the mountains are of a great height, with narrow breaks, which serve to discharge the descending streams. From the top of these mountains the plains of Sirhind present a wide prospect to the S. E. S. and S. W. the view to the northward is terminated at a short distance by snowy mountains. There is no cultivation seen in the neighbourhood of the Junna, although a spacious plain extends on the west side, which might be watered without much difficulty from that river. From Nahn the northern sides of the hills produce the Scotch fir in great abundance, and the willow is frequently found. This district is also known by the appellation of Siremoue. It is possessed by native chiefs, subject to the extortions both of the Seiks and Ghourkhalies of Nepaul. (Foster, Kirkpatrick, &c.)\n\nNahn.\u2014A town in Northern Hindostan, the capital of a district of the same name, and situated on the top of a high mountain. Lat. 30\u00b0. 41'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 7'. E.\n\nNairs.\u2014See Malabar.\n\nNamboody.\u2014A town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Aurungabad, 16 miles north from Ahmednuggur. Lat. 19\u00b0. 15'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 3'. E.\n\nNancowry Isle.\u2014One of the Nicoban Islands, about 25 miles in circumference. Lat. 7\u00b0. 57'. N. Long. 93\u00b0. 43'. E. The Island of Comarty lies contiguous; and, being excavated by a large bay, does not probably contain more square miles of land than this isle. The space between these two islands forms a capacious and excellent harbour; the eastern entrance of which is sheltered by another island, called Trikut, lying at the distance of a league. The inlet from the west is narrow, but sufficiently deep to admit the largest ships.\n\nThe soil is rich, but little cultivated. The natural productions are cocoa nuts, papias, plantains, limes, tamarinds, betel nut, and the melori (a species of bread fruit). Yams and other roots are cultivated and thrive, but rice is unknown. The mangosteen tree and pine apples grow wild. The two islands of Nancowry and Comarty are said to contain 13 villages, each possessing\nabout 50 or 60 inhabitants; the population of both may, therefore, be estimated at 800 souls. They live mostly on the sea shore, and their houses are erected on piles, frequently so near the shore as to admit of the tide flowing under them. The men are stout and well limbed, but extremely indolent; the women being much more active, although inferior in stature. Contrary to the usual custom of the natives of India, females shave their heads, or keep the hair close cropped.\n\nThe inhabitants of Nanowry are described as hospitable and honest, and remarkable for their strict adherence to truth; in which, if true, they certainly differ from their neighbours on the continent. It is also asserted that such crimes as theft, robbery, and murder, are unknown. They are fond of intoxication, and if they happen to quarrel they drub each other with hard and knotty sticks, until no longer able to endure the contest; after which they put a stop to the combat by mutual agreement, and all get drunk again.\n\nThe Danes long possessed a settlement on this island, which existed so late as 1791. It consisted of a sergeant and three or four soldiers, a few black slaves, and two rusty old pieces of ordnance. They had two houses; one inhabited by this garrison, and the other by missionaries. The island is annually visited by from 15 to 20 large praws, with Malays and Chinese from the Coast of Malacca, in quest of the edible bird nests; the crews of which always create much confusion and quarreling among the islanders, who are otherwise peaceable. (Hamilton, Col. Colebrooke, Haensel, &c.)\n\nNandaprayaga.\u2014A place of pilgrimage in Northern Hindostan, in the province of Serinagur, situated at the confluence of the Alacananda with the Nandaeni, a small river which flows from the south 36\u00b0 E. Lat. 36\u00b0 22' N. Long. 78\u00b0 22' E.\n\nThis is the most northerly of the prayagas, or holy places, and there was formerly a temple and small village on the spot, but no remains of either are now to be seen. A few grain dealers occasionally fix their temporary shop here; and, to supply the want of a temple in a place of such sanctity, a few loose stones are piled up, on which some Hindoo images are exposed for the adoration of the pilgrims. (Raper, &c.)\n\nNandere, (Naudia).\u2014A small province in the Deccan, situated about the 19th degree of north latitude, and intersected by the Godavry. When the Institutes of Achber were compiled, Nandere was comprehended in the soubah of Berar, under the name of Sircar Telinganich, but was afterwards raised to the dignity of a separate province. Its limits have never been accurately defined, but it may be estimated at 150 miles in length, by 35 miles the average breadth. Abul Fazel's description is as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Telinganich, containing 19 mahals; revenue 71,904,000 dams. Seyurghal 6,600,000 dams.\"\n\nIn the present geographical situation of Nandere, it is bounded on the north by Berar; on the south by Hyderabad and Beeder; on the east by Gundwana; and on the west by Aurungabad. The soil is very fertile and well watered, and capable of supporting a much greater population than it at present possesses; the whole number not exceeding half a million, of whom not above 1-10th are Mahomedans. The province has long been subject to the Nizam's family, and continues comprehended in the dominions of that sovereign, liable to much misgovernment. The principal towns are Nandere, Candhar, Baleundah, and Nimuhl. (Abul Fazel, Remel, &c., &c.)\n\nNandoor, (Naudaver).\u2014A town in the Northern Circars, 74 miles S. W. by S. from Vizagapatam. Lat. 17\u00b0 27' N. Long. 82\u00b0 25' E.\n\nNanparah.\u2014A town in the Nabob of Oude's territories, 80 miles\nN. N. E. from Lucknow. Lat. 27\u00b0, 52'. N. Long. 81\u00b0. 30'.

E.\n\nNarayongunge.\u2014A considerable inland trading town in the province of Bengal, district of Dacca Jelalpoor, situated on the west side of a branch of the Brahmapootra, named the Situl Luckia. Lat. 23\u00b0. 37'. N. Long. 90\u00b0. 35'. E. The inhabitants of this place amount to above 15,000, and carry on a great trade in salt, grain, tobacco, and lime; and the town exhibits a scene of commercial activity seldom seen in a community entirely composed of Hindoos. Most of the principal merchants are not natives of the town, nor of the surrounding country, but accidental settlers from distant districts, who do not bring their families with them. During the height of the rains the adjacent country is almost entirely covered with waters; but when within bounds the Luckia is one of the most beautiful rivers in Bengal, and here presents a scene of animated industry, not general in the province. In the surrounding country are the remains of many fortifications, erected to repel the invasions of the Mughals, but which do not appear to have been well calculated for the purpose intended. On the opposite side of the river, a few miles above Narayongunge, is a place of Mahomedan pilgrimage, named Cuddumresool, where is shewn a footprint of the prophet, much reverenced by the pious of that faith, who resort to it in great numbers from Dacca and the adjacent villages.\n\nNarangur, (Narayanaghar).\u2014A town in the province of Orissa, district of Midnapoor, 66 miles S. W. from Calcutta. Lat. 22\u00b0. 11'. N. Long. 87\u00b0. 35'. E.\n\nNarasinhapoor.\u2014A town in the Mysore Rajah's territories, situated on the banks of the Cauvery, immediately below its junction with the Capini, 26 miles S. E. from Seriingapatam. Lat. 12\u00b0. 8'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 5'. E.\n\nThis place at present contains about 300 houses. A few miles further down the Cauvery, in the month of October, is a large and deep river, flowing with a gentle stream about a quarter of a mile in width. In the hot season it is fordable; but after heavy rains, it rises above its level in October 10 or 12 feet perpendicular, and completely fills its channel. The only ferry-boats here are what are called donies, which are baskets of a circular form, eight or 10 feet in diameter, and covered with leather.\n\nNear to Narasinghapoor, between the Neelaserry and Moguroo, is a fine plain of rich black mould, fit for any cultivation. Soil of this description produces annually two crops, the first of Jola (Holcus Sorghum), and the second of cotton, which last is the chief article cultivated. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nNariad.\u2014A town formerly belonging to the Guicowar Maharatta chief, in the province of Gujrat, 25 miles N. N. E. from Cambay. Lat. 22\u00b0. 42'. N. Long. 72\u00b0. 59'. E. This town and the surrounding district were ceded by the Guicowar to the British in 1803, in part payment of the subsidiary force, and were then valued at 175,000 rupees per annum.\n\nNarikee.\u2014A town in the province of Agra, 28 miles E.

By Abul Fazel, in 1582, this place is described as follows:\n\n\"Nernaleh is a large fort, containing many buildings, situated on the top of a mountain. Sircar Nernaleh contains 34 mahals; revenue, 130,954,476 dams; seyurghal, 11,038,422 dams. This sircar furnishes 50 cavalry, and 3000 infantry.\"\n\nNARNOUL.\u2014A district in the N.E. quarter of the province of Agra, situated principally between the 28th and 29th degrees of north latitude. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Narnoul, containing 17 mahals; measurement, 2,080,046 beegahs; revenue, 50,046,711 dams; seyurghal, 775,103 dams.

Lat. 16\u00b0. 21'. N. Long. 81\u00b0. 50'. E.\n\nNARWAR, (Naravara).\u2014A district in the southern quarter of the Agra Province, situated principally between the 25th and 26th degrees of north latitude. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Narwar, containing five mahals; measurement, 394,350 beegahs; revenue, 4,233,322 dams; seyurghal, 95,994 dams. This sircar furnishes 500 cavalry, and 20,000 infantry.\"\n\nThe face of the country in this district is hilly and woody, but the soil in many parts is rich, and when well cultivated extremely productive. The Sinde is the chief river, and the principal towns are Narwar, Collarass, and Shepoory.\n\nNARWAR.\u2014A town in the province of Agra, district of Narwar, of which it is the capital, and situated on the S.E. side of the Sinde River. Lat. 25\u00b0. 41'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 12'. E.\n\nThis is a town of considerable antiquity, having been conquered by the Mahommedans so early as 1251; but it subsequently recovered its independence; as in 1509 we find it again under the government of a Hindoo prince, from whom it was taken by Sultan Secunder-Lodi. At the peace concluded with the Maharrattas, the fort and district of Narwar were guaranteed by the British government to Rajah Umbajee Row; at which period the revenue attached to the districts he retained amounted to about 10 lacks of rupees per annum. The guarantee was afterwards withdrawn, and the place was surrendered in 1810 to Dowlet Row Sindia, the garrison having been corrupted.\n\nNARYTAMOE, (Nairitamu).\u2014An extensive province in Tibet, situated principally between the 30th and 31st degrees of north latitude, and bounded on the south by the Himalaya ridge of mountains, which separates it from Hindostan. This territory is intersected by the great River Brahmapootra, known here by the name of the Sanpoo, the banks of which are frequently visited by Hindoo itinerant devotees. A commercial intercourse is also carried on with the Ghoorkhali Nepaul territories to the south, but no European traveller has ever reached this remote region. Like the rest of Tibet, the inhabitants profess the doctrines of Buddha, under a Lama hierarchy, protected by the Emperor of China, to whom the whole province is subject.\nNassau Isles.\u2014See Poggy Isles.\n\nNassuck.\u2014A town belonging to the Peshwa, in the province of Aurungabad, 90 miles north from Poona. Lat. 19\u00b0. 49'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 56'. E.\n\nNataana, (Navathana).\u2014A small village in Northern Hindostan, in the province of Serinagur, consisting of a few houses on the sloping brow of a hill. Lat. 20\u00b0. 7'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 48'. E. On account of the elevation of its site, the temperature of the air is considerably reduced. The surrounding mountains exhibit a very naked appearance. At this place cows and bullocks are the only animals to be met with, the inhabitants having neither dogs, cats, sheep, nor the common fowl. (Hardenicke, &c.)\n\nNatal, (or Natar).\u2014A Malay town on the S.W. coast of the Island of Sumatra. Lat. 6\u00b0. 18'. N. Long. 99\u00b0. 5'. E. The English have had a settlement here since 1752; the other inhabitants are mostly colonists, come for the convenience of trade, from Achin, Raw, and Menanacabow. There is here a considerable vent for imported goods, the returns for which are gold and camphor. Rice is brought from the Island of Neas, and afterwards re-exported to Benecolen.\n\nGold of a very fine quality is procured from the interior, some of the mines being said to lie within 10 miles of the factory. As the gold received here is generally dust, great care should be taken by strangers to have it proved before a bargain is made, as it is frequently much adulterated. Aquafortis is the best test; but if that cannot be procured, it may be tried with spirits of hartshorn. The principal imports are piece goods, opium, coarse cutlery, ammunition and guns, brass wire, and china-ware. The exports, gold, camphor, and some wax.\n\nThe influence of the British East India Company is not so predominant here as in the pepper districts to the southward, owing to the numbers of the inhabitants, their wealth and independent spirit. They find the English useful as moderators between their own contending factions, which often have recourse to arms on points of ceremonious precedence. (Marsden, Elmore, &c.)\n\nNat'dorah, (Nat'ha Devara, the Temple of God).\u2014A town in the province of Ajmeer, situated about 24 miles north from Odyepoor. Here is a celebrated Hindoo temple of great sanctity, having many villages appropriated, which are considered sacred by the contending Rajpoot and Maharatta armies. The Gossains (Hindoo devotees) carry on a considerable trade with Gujrat and Tatta, and also with the rest of Rajpootana and Hindostan Proper. (Broughton, 6th Register, &c.)\n\nNattradacotta, (Nat'ha Radhacata).\u2014A town in the province of Tinnevelly, 68 miles N.N.E. from Cape Comorin. Lat. 8\u00b0. 46'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 10'. E.\n\nNattam.\u2014A town in the Southern Carnatic, in the Polygar territory, 15 miles E. by S. from Dindigul. Lat. 10\u00b0. 17'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 15'. E.\n\nNatore, (Nat'haver).\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Raujeshy, 43 miles N.E. from Moorshedabad. Lat. 24\u00b0. 25'. N. Long. 88\u00b0. 55'. E. Appearances favour the opinion, that the Ganges once had its bed in the tract now occupied by the lakes and morasses between Natore and Jaffergunge. During the inundation there is a straight navigation for 160 miles from Dacca to this place across those jecls or lakes, leaving the villages erected on artificial mounds, and the groves of trees projecting out of the water to the right and left. The current is so gentle, as scarcely to exceed half a mile per hour. This place is the capital of the Raujeshy district. (Remel, &c.)\n\nNatunas North Isles.\u2014A cluster of very small islands in the China Seas. Lat. 4\u00b0. 45'. N. Long. 109\u00b0. E. From October to December the best tract for ships bound to China is past these islands to the north.\nNatunas South Isles.\u2014A cluster of very small islands lying off the north-western coast of the Island of Borneo, about Lat. 3\u00b0 N. Long. 109\u00b0 E.\n\nNatuna (Great) Isle.\u2014An island in the China Sea, lying off the N.E. coast of Borneo, about the fourth degree of north latitude. In length it may be estimated at 34 miles, by 13 the average breadth, and is surrounded by numerous small rocky isles. Some of the high mountains on this island may be seen 15 leagues off.\n\nNautpoor, (Nat'hapura).\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Purneah, situated on the west side of the Cossah River, 42 miles N.N.W. from the town of Purneah. Lat. 26\u00b0 17'. N. Long. 16\u00b0 58'. E.\n\nNavacott.\u2014A town in Northern Hindostan, subject to the Choorkhali Rajah of Nepaul, 105 miles N.E. from Catmandoo. Lat. 28\u00b0 57'. N. Long. 83\u00b0 37'. E.\n\nNeamutseral.\u2014A fortified village, with a caravanserai, in the district of Puckoli, 56 miles N.E. from Attock. Lat. 33\u00b0 30'. N. Long. 71\u00b0 50'. E. This place stands on the western limit of Jansul, the territory of Gul Shore Khan, an Afghan, and on the north-eastern border of Lahore. This serai is placed on the west side of a break in the great range of mountains which extends from the Punjab to the Indus. (Foster, &c.)\n\nNeas Isle.\u2014An island lying off Tapanooly Bay, on the west coast of Sumatra, from which it is distant about 60 miles, and intersected by the first degree of north latitude. In length it may be estimated at 50 miles, by 20 the average breadth.\n\nNeas is the most important and productive, although not the largest of this chain of islands. The inhabitants are numerous, and of a race distinct, not only from those of the main, but also from the people of all the islands to the southward, with the exception of Pulo Kapini. Their complexions, especially of the women, are lighter than those of the Malays; they are smaller in their persons, and shorter in their stature; their mouths are broad, noses very flat, and their ears are pierced and distended in so extraordinary a manner, as nearly in many instances to touch their shoulders. They are also distinguished by a leprous scurf, which covers their bodies, but does not appear inconsistent with perfect health in other respects.\n\nThe people of this island are remarkable for their docility and expertness in handicraft work, and become excellent house carpenters and joiners; and, as an instance of their skill in the arts, they practice that of blood-letting in a mode similar to ours. Among their neighbours, the Sumatrans, blood is never drawn with so salutary an intent. The Neassers are industrious, frugal, temperate, and regular in their habits; but, at the same time, avaricious, sullen, obstinate, vindictive, and sanguinary. Although much employed as domestic slaves, particularly by the Dutch, they are always esteemed dangerous in that capacity. They frequently kill themselves when disgusted with their situation, or unhappy in their families, and often by consent kill their wives at the same time. They have been found after their deaths dressed in their best apparel, and appear to have taken precautions that their dress should not be discomposed by the act of suicide.\n\nThe principal food of the common people is the sweet potatoe, but much pork is also eaten by those who can afford it; and the chiefs ornament their houses with the jaws of the hogs they eat, as well as with the skulls of their enemies whom they slay. In modern times the cultivation of rice has become extensive, but rather as an article of foreign traffic than of home consumption.\n\nThe Island of Neas is divided into 50 small districts, under chiefs or rajahs who are independent of, and\nat perpetual variance with each other; the ultimate object of their wars being to make prisoners, whom they sell for slaves, as well as all others not immediately connected with themselves, whom they can overpower by stratagem. The number annually exported varies between 600 and 1000. It is said the Neassers expose their children by suspending them in a bag from a tree, when they despair of being able to bring them up.\n\nBesides the article of slaves, there is a considerable export of rice, which the natives of the interior bring down to barter with the traders on the coast for iron, steel, beads, tobacco, and the coarser kinds of Surat and Madras piece goods. Numbers of hogs are reared, and some parts of the main are supplied from hence with yams, beans, and poultry. Some of the petty rajahs on this island are supposed to have amassed treasures equal to 10 or 20,000 dollars, which are kept in ingots of gold and silver. Dr. Leyden was of opinion that the dialect of Neas had greater pretensions to originality than any of the languages of Sumatra. (Marsden, &c.)\n\nNEELAHUNDAH, (Nilacant'ha, Blue-necked).\u2014A town in the Afghun territories, in the province of Lahore, 47 miles S.S.E. from Attock, on the Indus. Lat. 32\u00b0. 38'. N. Long. 71\u00b0. 49'. E.\n\nNEELAB, (Blue Water).\u2014A town in the province of Lahore, situated on the east side of the Indus, 30 miles S.S.W. from Attock. Lat. 32\u00b0. 50'. N. Long. 70\u00b0. 53'. E.\n\nNEELGUR.\u2014A town in the province of Orissa, district of Cuttack, seven miles west from Baisore. Lat. 21\u00b0. 30'. N. Long. 87\u00b0. 10'. E. This was formerly the chief town of a considerable zeminary, separated by the Maharattas from the Moherbunge Rajah's territories. It communicates its name to that range of hills which extend to the west of Midnapoor. (1st Register, &c.)\n\nNEELGUNGE.\u2014A small town in the Nabob of Onde's territories, 14 miles W. by S. from Lucknow. Lat. 26\u00b0. 47'. N. Long. 80\u00b0. 42'. E.\n\nNEGAPATAM, (Nagapatana).\u2014A sea-port town in the province of Tanjore, 48 miles east from the town of Tanjore. Lat. 10\u00b0. 45'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 55'. E. This place was taken from the Portuguese by the Dutch in 1660, who strengthened its fortifications, and made it the capital of their settlements on the Coromandel Coast. They also established a mint here, which used to coin gold to the amount of four or five lacks of rupees annually. In 1731 it was invested by the British with about 4000 troops; on the 30th of October the lines and redoubts were carried, and on the 12th of November the town and fort surrendered by capitulation, after making two vigorous and desperate sallies. At the peace of 1783 it was finally ceded to the British; and the fortifications, having become of little importance from the altered state of the Carnatic, have been since little attended to. The town is now a place of inconsiderable trade, but frequently touched at by ships for refreshments, which are plenty. (Fra Paolo, Lord Valentia, Fullarton, Johnson, &c.)\n\nNEGOMBO, (Nagambhu, Land of Serpents).\u2014A large and populous village on the west coast of Ceylon, situated about 24 miles north from Columbo. Lat. 7\u00b0. 19'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 49'. E.\n\nThis is one of the healthiest places on the island, being in this respect next to Jaffnapatnam. The Dutch erected a fort here for the protection of the cinnamon cutters, which still remains. There are also three long ranges of buildings, which serve for barracks and storehouses. Negombo is very advantageously situated for carrying on the inland trade, particularly with Columbo, as a branch of the Mulivaddy River here runs into the sea, by which goods are conveyed inland to Columbo. One of the principal articles sent by this channel from Negombo is fish, the\ntrade in which is the property of government, and annually farmed out to the best bidder. Many Dutch families in decayed circumstances reside here.\n\nThe country in the neighbourhood of this town is flat and open, the fields very fertile, and well adapted for the cultivation of rice, from the constant supply of water, as the whole is inundated during the rainy season. The cinnamon produced is reckoned of an equal quality with any in the island. The inhabitants of Negombo are a mixture of Mahomedans, Makabars, and native Portuguese; the females of these castes, and of the native Ceylonese, are accounted the handsomest in Ceylon. When the English landed here, in 1796, the fort surrendered without opposition. (Percival, &c.)\n\nNegrais Isle.\u2014A small island and excellent harbour in the Birman dominions, situated at the mouth of the westernmost branch of the great River Irawaddy, named the Negrais, or Bassein branch. Lat. 16\u00b0. 2'. N. Long. 93\u00b0. 19'. E. Cape Negrais, the most S. W. extremity of India beyond the Ganges, is in Lat. 16\u00b0. N. Long. 93\u00b0. 15'. E. and is known by an Indian temple, or pagoda, which is erected on it. Negrais Harbour is, without exception, the most secure in the Bay of Bengal; as from hence a ship launches at once into the open sea, and may work to the southward without any other impediment than the monsoon opposes.\n\nThe Madras government established a small settlement on this island so early as 1687; but, little benefit being derived from it, it was subsequently relinquished. In 1751 it was again occupied by the English, mismanaged, and abandoned. In 1757 Alompra, the founder of the present Birman dynasty, granted the East India Company some valuable immunities, and ceded the Island of Negrais to them in perpetuity, which was taken possession of with the usual ceremonies on the 22d of August, 1757. In 1759 the Birmans murdered all the English settlers they could lay hold of (about nine-tenths), and compelled the remainder to evacuate. (Symes, Dalrymple, &c.)\n\nNegros Isle.\u2014A large island, one of the Philippines, situated due south of Luzon, or Laconia, about the 123rd degree of east longitude. In length it may be estimated at 145 miles, by 25 miles the average breadth. This island was so named by the Spaniards, from its being, when discovered, almost entirely inhabited by the Papuan or oriental negroes, called Samangs by the Malays.\n\nNehrwalla.\u2014An ancient town in the province of Gujrat, named also Patana, or the city. Lat. 24\u00b0. 25'. N. Long. 72\u00b0. 30'. E. At some remote period of Hindoo history this was the capital of the province; and it is described as still exhibiting ruins of considerable grandeur. Abul Fazel mentions it as a fortified town, and asserts, that it produced oxen capable of travelling 50 coss in half a day. In ancient Gujratte manuscripts it is named Anhulvada, and at present is comprehended in the territories of the Guicowar.\n\nNelliseram.\u2014A town on the seacoast of the Canara province, 42 miles from Mangalore. Lat. 12\u00b0. 16'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 12'. E.\n\nNelloor, (Nilaver).\u2014A town in the Carnatic, situated about 500 yards distant from the south side of the Pennar River, 102 miles N. N. W. from Madras. Lat. 14\u00b0. 26'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 55'. E.\n\nIn 1757, when this place was besieged by Colonel Forde, it extended about 1200 yards from east to west, and 600 on the other sides. The walls were of mud, and only the gateway and a few of the towers of stone. The parapet was six feet high, with many port holes for small arms, made of pipes and baked clay, laid in the moist mud whilst raising, and afterwards consolidated with the mass, which is the common mode of raising their defences in India.\nOn this occasion Colonel Forde, although an officer of the first ability, was obliged to raise the siege. It was subsequently acquired by the nabobs of the Carnatic, and in 1801 ceded by treaty, along with the district, to the British. Nelloor and Ongole, including part of the Western Pollams, now form one of the collectorships, into which the Carnatic has been subdivided under the Madras Presidency; but the country has not yet been permanently assessed for the revenue.\n\nThe export trade from Nelloor and Ongole is confined principally to salt, the value of which, in 1811-12, amounted to 62,843 Arcot rupees. From the 1st of May, 1811, to the 30th of April, 1812, the arrivals in the Nelloor district were 739 vessels and craft, measuring 24,948 tons; the departures, 137 vessels and craft, measuring 1909 tons.\n\nAbout 1787, a peasant near this town found his plough obstructed by some brick-work; and, having dug, he discovered the remains of a small Hindoo temple, under which a little pot was found, containing Roman coins and medals of the second century. He sold them as old gold, and many were melted; but about 30 were recovered before they underwent the fusing operation. They were all of them of the purest gold, and many of them fresh and beautiful. Some were much defaced and perforated, as if they had been worn as ornaments on the arm, or round the neck. They were mostly Trajans, Adrianis, or Faustinas. (Orme, Davidson, 5th Report, &c.)\n\nNelway, (Nilwai).\u2014A town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Malwah, 13 miles west from Oojain. Lat. 23\u00b0. 14'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 35'. E.\n\nNemaar.\u2014A district in the Maharratta territories, in the province of Khandesh, situated principally between the 21st and 22d degrees of north latitude, and bounded on the south by a ridge of hills. The chief towns are Kargauw and Cunduah; but there are no rivers of any magnitude.\n\nNEPAUL, (Nepala).\n\nIncluding the tributary provinces, this is one of the most extensive independent sovereignties in India, comprehending at present nearly the whole of Northern Hindostan. The territories which compose this state are situated principally between the 27th and 32d degrees of north latitude, and in length, from N. E. to S. W. may be estimated at 700 miles, by 100 miles the average breadth.\n\nTo the east, the possessions of the Ghoorkhali Rajahs of Nepaul are bounded by those of the Deb Rajah of Boctan; to the S. E. they touch the Bengal districts of Rungpoor, Dinagepoor, and Cooch Bahar. The Nepaul frontier, towards the east, is distinguished by the town and district of Sookhim, by the Morning Hills on the S. E. quarter; and on the N. E. by the towns of Dhoalka and Lastic. The country lying between Catmandoo and the borders described, is almost entirely mountainous, giving rise to many rapid streams.\n\nAlong the whole southern frontier, from Rungpoor, in Bengal, to Bellaspoor, on the Sutuleje, in the province of Delhi, the Nepaul territories are bounded by the British districts in Bengal, Bahar, Oude, and Delhi, with the exception of about 60 miles, belonging to the Nabob of Oude, which intervene. Since the conquest of Scrinagur, in 1803, by the Nepalese, the Sutuleje River forms the boundary to the west, separating their territories from the province of Lahore, on which they have already begun to encroach. Along the whole northern frontier the great Himalaya chain of mountains divides them from the elevated table land of Tibet. The limits assigned above describe the empire in its utmost dimensions, of which a very small portion only (hereafter\nto be described) has any claim to the appellation of Nepaul. The modern names of the other principal districts are Gorcah, Kyraut, Morung, Muckwanny, Mocwanpoor, Lamjung, Tahnoon, 24 Rajahs, Cashy, Palpah, Ismah, Rolpah, Peytahu, Deucar, Jemlah, Kemaoon, Almora, and Serinagur.\n\nThe Bhagnatty River, which passes between Manniary and the Kuttiool of modern maps, divides in this quarter the British and Nepaul territories in a direction nearly S. S. W. but the river, although wide, is not, at particular seasons of the year, above knee-deep. On the western side, south of Hettowra, the common boundary of the British and Nepaul territories may be described by a line drawn midway between Ekdurra and Ullown. At Kettowra the country is composed of a confused heap of hills, separated in various directions by narrow bottoms or glens, which is also the appearance exhibited by the greatest part of the mountainous tract known under the general name of Nepaul; no single uninterrupted chain or range being met with after passing the Cheraghauti ridge. The sides of these hills are everywhere covered with tall forests (chiefly of saul or sessoo), or partially cultivated with different sorts of grain. The mountainous tract to the east is inhabited by various uncivilized nations, the principal of whom are the Kyrauts, the Hawoos, and the Limbooas, who are all Hindoos of the Brahminical persuasion, but of the lowest castes. The chief towns are Catmandoo the capital, Goreah, Pattan, Bhatgan, Jemlah, Almora, and Serinagur.\n\nThe Valley of Nepaul Proper, from whence the sovereignty takes its name, is nearly of an oval figure: its greatest length, from north to south, being about 12 miles, by nine its greatest breadth; the circumference of the whole being under 50 miles. To the south it is bounded by very stupendous mountains; but to the east and west the enclosing hills are less lofty. Sheopuri, which constitutes its principal barrier to the north, is the highest of the mountains that encircle it, from whence issue the Bhagnatty and Vishnumatty Rivers, which, with many other streams, traverse the Valley of Nepaul\u2014the bottom of which, besides being very uneven, is intersected with deep ravines, and speckled with little hills. Seen from Mount Chandraghiri, the Valley of Nepaul appears thickly settled with villages, among fields fertilized by numerous streams; but the part of the view which most powerfully attracts the attention, are the adjacent enormous mountains of Sheopoori and Jibjibia, with the gigantic Himalaya ridge, covered with everlasting snow in the background.\n\nIn some ancient Hindu books Nepaul is called Deccani Tapoo, or the Southern Isle, in reference to its situation with respect to the Himalaya Mountains, and the contiguous northern regions; the Valley of Nepaul being there described as an immense lake, which, in the progress of ages, had retired within the banks of the Bhagmutty.\n\nThe northernmost part of the Nepaul Valley scarcely lies in a higher parallel of latitude than 27\u00b0 30' N. yet it enjoys, in some respects, the climate of the south of Europe. Its height above the sea appears, from the barometer, to be above 4000 feet. The mean temperature, from the 17th to the 25th of March, was 67 degrees. The seasons here are pretty much the same as in Upper Hindostan. The rains commence rather earlier, and set in from the south-east quarter; are usually very copious, and break up about the middle of October. In a few hours the inhabitants, by ascending the mountains, can pass a variety of temperatures; and, in three or four days' journey, by moving from Noakote to Kheroo, or Ramika, may exchange the heat of Bengal for the cold of Russia.\nThroughout Nepaul Proper the Newar tribes alone cultivate the ground, and exercise the useful arts; but they enjoy little security or happiness under their present rulers. The sovereign is here decreed to be originally the absolute proprietor of all lands. Even the first subject of the state has, generally speaking, but a temporary and precarious interest in the lands which he holds,\u2014being liable, at every punjumini (or grand council), to be deprived of them altogether; to have them commuted for a pecuniary stipend, or to have them exchanged for others. This council consists of the principal ministers of government, and of such other persons as the sovereign thinks proper to invite to it.\n\nThe lands of the Nepaul state are divided into, 1. Crown lands; 2. Birta, or Binooter lands; 3. Kohrya, or Bari lands, (such as are destitute of streams); and, 4. Kaith, or plantation lands of the first quality. The beegah is used in mensuration by the Purbutties only; by which appellation the occupiers of the hilly regions surrounding the Valley of Nepaul, are distinguished from the Newars, or proper inhabitants of the latter. Many kaiths yield three harvests; one of rice, one of wheat, pulse, &c., and sometimes one or two of an excellent vegetable, named tori. There are grounds that yield two crops of rice successively; one fine, and the other coarse; besides affording, in the same year, a wheat crop.\n\nThe sugar-cane is cultivated in the Nepaul Valley; but rarely more is raised than is required for the consumption of the chief landlords: the seed is always sown by females. The plough is scarcely ever used by the cultivators in the valley, who prepare their ground for rice by digging to a certain depth with a sort of spade, turning up the soil in ridges, as in potatoe plantations, leaving the whole for some time until well flooded, and finally levelling the field. Among the spontaneous productions of Nepaul are the raspberry, the walnut, and the mulberry.\n\nThe cattle of Nepaul, generally speaking, are not superior to those commonly met with in Bengal; and the Chowry cow, and Changca or shawl goat, are only to be found among the mountains bordering on Tibet. The inhabitants of the latter country use sheep as beasts of burthen, for the transporting of salt into Nepaul; of which each is said to carry 42 pounds avoirdupois. This district does not abound much with game; and the fish, from the transparency and rapidity of the stream, are very difficult to catch with the fly. The sarus, ortolan, wild goose, and wild duck, appear in Nepaul only as birds of passage, making a stage of it between Hindostan and Tibet. Copper and iron are found here; the latter of an excellent quality. Oude was formerly supplied with copper from this country; but of late the European copper, by underselling, has driven the Nepaul copper out of the markets. The gold imported to Bengal from Nepaul is not the produce of the country\u2014the quantity procured from the rivulets flowing through the territory being extremely small. The gold is received by the Nepalese, from Tibet, in exchange for goods.\n\nThe commerce of Nepaul is not so extensive as it might be under better regulations. This is partly to be attributed to the ignorance and jealousy of the administration; but also, in a great degree, to the monopolies certain Uluts, or mercantile Gosains, and a few other merchants, have long been in possession of. If it was not for these obstacles, an extensive traffic might be carried on between Tibet and the British territories through Nepaul.\n\nNepaul exports to British India: elephants, elephants' teeth, rice, timber, hides, ginger, terra japonica, turmeric, wax, honey, pure rezin of the pine, walnuts, oranges, long pepper, ghee, bark of the root of bastard cinnamon, dried leaves of\nditto, large cardamums, dammer, lamp oil, and cotton of the simul tree. These articles are the produce of the Morung and other parts of the Turyani, and of Nepaul. Besides these, a great variety of articles produced in Tibet are sent south through Nepaul. There are small quantities of salt and saltpetre made in the eastern part of the Nepaul Valley; but the former is not so much esteemed by the natives as that of Tibet. The following articles are exported from the British dominions to Nepaul, either for the consumption of that country, or for the Tibet market; viz. Bengal cloths, muslins and silks of various sorts, raw silk, gold and silver laces, carpets, English cutlery, saffron, spices, sandal wood, quicksilver, cotton, tin, zinc, lead, soap, camphor, chillies, tobacco, and coral.\n\nThe Newars of Nepaul fabricate only cloths of a very coarse kind. The cotton employed is the produce either of Niakot, or of the Muddaize; by which last name they commonly distinguish the Company's territories. They work very well in iron, copper, and brass, and are particularly ingenious in carpentry, though they never use a saw\u2014dividing their wood, of whatever size, with the chissel and mallet. They export some of their brazen utensils to the southward. They have latterly, without success, attempted to manufacture some fire-arms; but their swords and daggers are tolerably good. They gild extremely well, and construct bells of so large a size as five feet diameter. From rice and other grain they distil spirits, and also prepare a fermented liquor from wheat, munna, rice, &c. which they name phaur: it is made in the manner of our malt liquors, which it resembles. The currency of Nepaul consists chiefly of silver pieces of eight annas, (14.) called a sieca; and they have a coin so low as the 280th part of a sieca.\n\nThe great mass of the inhabitants in Nepaul dwell in the vallies, the hills, and Terriani, being but thinly populated. General Kirkpatrick estimated the population of the Nepaul Valley at half a million, which appears an extraordinary number when its small dimensions are considered. The inhabitants consist principally of the two superior classes of Hindoos, (Brahmins and Khetries, with their subdivisions,) Newars, Dhenwars, Mhanjees, Bhooteas, and Bhauras. The two first sects, who occupy the principal stations in the sovereignty, and fill the armies, are dispersed through the country. The Newars are confined almost to the Valley of Nepaul; the Dhenwars and Mhanjees are the fishermen and husbandmen of the western districts; and the Bhooteas inhabit such parts of Kuchar (Lower Tibet) as are included in the Nepaul territories. The Bhauras are separatists from the Newars, and amount to about five thousand. To the eastward, some districts are inhabited by the Limbooas, Nuggerkooties, and others; of whom little is known besides the name. The Newars are divided into several castes, like those among the more southern Hindoos.\n\nThe Parbntties, or peasantry of the mountainous country, are divided into four classes, according to the number of ploughs, and the nature of their occupation. The expenses of the military establishments are, for the most part, discharged by assignments of land; though, in some instances, the soldier receives his pay from the treasury. In money and lands together, the pay of the private sepoy amounts to about 76 rupees per annum, exclusive of his coat, which is supplied by government. Some of the villages bestowed in jaghires are of considerable value, yielding from three to 5000 rupees annual revenue. The income of a village, exclusive of what arises from the produce of such lands as may be annexed to it, consists principally in the rent of houses, which are all built of brick, and the duties charged on salt, tobacco, pepper,\nbetel nut, and similar articles of general consumption.\n\nThe Nepaul territories being for the most part parcelled out into jaghires, the proportion of their produce received into the treasury is not considerable. It probably never exceeds 30 lacks of rupees per annum, nor falls under 25. The profit from the mint alone is reckoned at from seven to eight lacks of rupees. The trade in gold from Tibet has usually been a monopoly in the hands of government; the copper mines formerly yielded a considerable revenue, but now scarcely produce a lack. The chief expenses of government are the provision of firearms and military stores\u2014of broad cloth, for the clothing of the regular troops\u2014and of jewels, silks, and cotton stuffs, from Bengal.\n\nThe Nepaul artillery is very bad. Matchlocks, bows and arrows, and kohras, or hatchet-swords, are the common weapons used. The regular forces are armed with muskets, of which few are fit for actual service. This force consists of from 50 to 60 companies, of unequal strength, but containing on an average not less than 140 fire-locks; the privates of which are brave and very hardy, but their discipline slovenly. The jung neshan, or war standard, is on a yellow ground, and exhibits a figure of Hoonimann\u2014a Hindoo deity, whose figure is that of a monkey. The Nepaul constitution of government is essentially despotic, modified by certain observances enjoined by immemorial custom\u2014the Dharma Shastra forming the basis of their jurisprudence in civil and criminal cases.\n\nThe inhabitants of this region have all along entertained but little intercourse with the neighbouring nations, and are probably the only Hindoo people who have never been disturbed, far less subdued, by any Mahommedan force. They are, in consequence, remarkable for a simplicity of character, and an absence of parade or affectation. The Ne-\n\nwar tribe differ, in many respects, from the other Hindoo inhabitants, particularly in feeding on the flesh of buffaloes. They probably never were of a warlike disposition, and are held in contempt by the Parbutties, or mountaineers. Their occupations are chiefly agricultural, and they execute most of the country arts and manufactures. They are of a middle size, broad shoulders and chest, stout limbs, round and rather flat faces, small eyes, low and somewhat spreading noses, and open cheerful countenances. The ordinary cast of their complexion is between a sallow and copper colour. It is remarkable that the Newar women, like the Nairs of Malabar, may in fact have as many husbands as they please, being at liberty to divorce them on the slightest pretences.\n\nIt is extremely probable there is no place in India, where a search after ancient valuable sanscrit manuscripts would be more successful than in the Valley of Nepaul, and particularly at Bhatgong, which is the Benares of the Ghoorkhali territories. General Kirkpatrick, the British ambassador to Nepaul, in 1793, was informed while there of one library, said to contain 15,000 volumes. Besides the sanscrit, which is cultivated by the Brahmans of Nepaul, the principal vernacular languages are the Parbutti, the Newar, the Dhenwar, the Muggur, the Kyrant, the Hovoo, the Limbooa, and the Bhootea.\n\nThe books held sacred by the Hindoos leave scarcely any room to doubt that the religion of Brahma has been established, from the most remote antiquity, in the Nepaul Valley, where there are as many temples as houses, and as many idol as inhabitants; there not being as fountain, river, or hill within its limits, that is not consecrated to some one or other of the Hindoo deities. The popular religion, in general, differs nothing from the Hindoo doctrines established in other parts of India, excepting so far as the se-\ncluded nature of the country may have assisted to preserve it in a state of superior purity. The Valley of Nepaul, in particular, abounds with temples of great sanctity, where Newars, or peasantry, sacrifice buffaloes to Bhavani, and afterwards feed on the flesh with great satisfaction. During the Ghurkhalai expedition to Tibet, the soldiers fed on the flesh of the Chowry cow, or long-haired bullock; yet were, in other respects, professors of the Brahminical religion.\n\nThe ancient history of Nepaul is very much clouded with mythological fable. The inhabitants have lists of princes for many ages back; of whom Ny Muni, who communicated his name to the valley, was the first. Like other eastern states, it often changed masters; but the revolutions appear either to have originated internally, or to have been connected with their immediate neighbours, as we never find them subjected to any other great Asiatic powers.\n\nIn A.D. 1323, Hur Singh Deo, Bajah of Semrounghur, and of the posterity of Bamdeb, of the Soorej Bungsi princes of Oude, entered Nepaul, and completely subdued it. The crown continued in his family until 1768, when Purthi Narayon, the Rajah of Gorcah (Ghoorka), put an end to the dynasty of the Semrounghur Khetries. Ranjeet Mull, of Bhatgong, was the last prince of the Soorej Bungsi race that reigned over Nepaul. He formed an alliance with Purthi Narrain, of Gorcah, with a view of strengthening himself against the sovereign of Catmandoo; but this connexion ended in the total reduction of Nepaul, by his ally, in the Newar year 888, corresponding with A.D. 1768. Ranjeet Mull took refuge at Benares, where he died, and left a son named Abdhool Singh, who is probably still alive.\n\nPurthi Narrain, the Ghurkhalai conqueror of Nepaul, died in 1771, leaving two sons, Singh Pertaub and Bahadur Sah, the former of whom succeeded him, and died in 1775, after having added considerably to the extent of his dominions by the subjugation of the districts of Tannohi, Soomaisee, Jogimara, and Oopadrong, lying to the S.W. of Nepaul.\n\nSingh Pertaub left only one legitimate son, Rajah Run Bahadur, who was his successor under the regency of his mother; during which period, Palpa, Garrumcote, and Kaski, were added to the Nepaul dominions. Under the succeeding regency of Bahadur Sah, the rajah's uncle, all the states lying between Kaski and Serinagur, including both the territories of the 24 and 22 Rajahs, comprehending the dominions of 46 petty princes, were either absolutely seized or rendered tributary.\n\nIn the year 1769 a force was detached by the Bengal government against the Ghurkhalais under Capt. Kinloch, which penetrated as far as Sedowly, an important post at the foot of the Nepaul Hills; but not being able to proceed further, and his troops being sickly, the enterprise was abandoned.\n\nTowards the end of Mr. Hastings's government, the Teschoo Lama of Tibet proceeded to Pekin, and dying soon after his arrival there, Sumhur Lama, his brother, fled from Lassa to the Rajah of Nepaul, taking with him a considerable quantity of treasure. By his communications he excited the avarice of the Nepaul government, which marched a body of troops towards Lassa. The armies of the latter being beaten, they agreed to pay a tribute of three lacks of rupees. In 1790 the Nepaulese, by the advice of Sumhur Lama, sent an army of 18,000 men against Teschoo Loomboo, the residence of another sacred Lama, which plundered that place and all its numerous temples. In their retreat from this place they lost 2000 men by the severity of the weather, great numbers of whom appear to have been frozen to death.\n\nIn 1792 the Emperor of China, as\ngrand protector of the Lamas, whom he worships, sent an army of 70,000 men against the Nepaul Rajah, which beat the Nepalese repeatedly, and advanced to Noakoile, within 26 miles of Catmandoo. The Nepalese were obliged at last to make peace on ignominious terms, consenting to become tributaries to the Emperor of China, and to restore all the plunder they had acquired from the Tibet Lamas. A treaty of commerce was at this time attempted by Lord Cornwallis, and Captain Kirkpatrick sent envoy to Catmandoo, but the extreme jealousy of the Nepalese frustrated all his endeavours.\n\nIn March, 1792, a treaty was entered into by Mr. Duncan, then resident at Benares, on the part of the British government, through the medium of native agents, by which it was stipulated, that two and a half per cent. should be reciprocally taken as duty on the imports from both countries, to be levied on the amount of the invoices stamped at the custom houses of their respective countries, for which purpose certain stations on the frontiers were selected. It was also agreed that the merchants, who had transported their goods into either country, and paid the regulated duty, and not meeting with a sale, wished to carry them to any other country, should pay no further duty, but be permitted to remove them; and it was stipulated that in all cases the merchants should experience a prompt administration of justice, when imposed on or oppressed.\n\nIn Oct. 1801, a more detailed political treaty was concluded, by which the friends and enemies of the one state were to have the same relation to the other, and arrangements were made for the amicable adjustment of any dispute respecting boundaries. Prior to this treaty a certain number of elephants had been sent annually by the Nepaul Rajah to the Bengal government, on account of the pargannah of Muckinacipoor; but the governor-general, with the view of gratifying the rajah, and in consideration of the improved friendly connexions, agreed to relinquish that tribute. A mutual exchange of felons and criminals was also agreed on, and the Rajah of Nepaul engaged to appropriate a district for the support and expenses of Samee Deo, a member of his own family, who had taken refuge in the British territories.\n\nIn order to carry into effect the different objects contained in this treaty, and to promote other verbal negociation, the governor-general and the Nepaul Rajah agreed each to depute a confidential person to reside as envoy with the other, who were instructed to abstain from all interference with the interior administration of the country to which they were delegated, or any intercourse with its disaffected subjects.\n\nSince the accession of the present Rajah Ghur, ban, judh, Bicrama Sah, a boy who, in 1808, was nine years of age, the councils and entire management of the country have been entrusted to, or rather usurped, by Bheem Singh Tapah. The Tapahs are Casias, or cultivators of the land, and formidable from their numbers. They oppose the Chawtras, who are Raipoots and uncles to the reigning prince, whose cognomen is Sah, and not Shah; though the latter is very generally affected on account of its royal import. (Kirkpatrick, Turner, Roper, Treaties, Giuseppe, &c.)\n\n**Nerbuddah River.** *(Narmada, rendering soft).*\u2014This river has its source at Omereuntue, in the province of Gundwana, close to that of the Soane. Lat. 22\u00b0.54'. N. Long. 82\u00b0.15'. E. After ascending a table land at Omereuntue, a Hindoo temple is found nearly in the centre of it, where the Nerbuddah rises from a small well, and glides along the surface of the high land, until reaching the west end it is precipitated into Mundlah. The fall is described by the natives as being very great, and they assert, that at the foot of\nthe table land its bed becomes a considerable expanse; and, being joined by other streams, it assumes the appearance of a river. From hence its course is nearly due west, with fewer curvatures than most Indian rivers, passing through part of Gundwana, Khandesh, Malwah, and Gujrat, where it joins the sea below Broach. Including the windings, the length of the whole course may be estimated at 750 miles. Salgramas, or sacred pebbles, are found in this river near to Omcar Mandatta, which are considered as types of Siva or Mahadeva, and are called Banling.\n\nThe name of Dekkan was formerly applied by Hindoo geographers to the whole of those countries which are situated to the south of the Ner-buddah; but the term Deccan now signifies, in Hindostan, the countries between the Ner-buddah and the Krishna. This river is also named the Reva, and it is very desirable, in a geographical point of view, that the country near its source should be properly explored and described. (Blunt, Colebrooke, Wilks, &c. &c.)\n\nNerinjapeittah.\u2014A small town in the northern district of Coimbe- toor. Lat. 11\u00b0 35'. N. Long. 77\u00b0 50'. E. This place is situated on the west bank of the Cavery, which here begins to rise about the 26th May, and is at its highest from the 13th of July until the 13th of August, before the rainy season commences. As this advances it decreases in size, but does not become fordable until after the 11th of January. Among the hills in this neighbourhood are many black bears, which are very harmless animals, living chiefly on white ants, wild fruit, and that of the palmyra. (H. Buchanon, &c.)\n\nNetravati River.\u2014A small river in the province of South Canara, which has its source in the Western Ghats, from whence it flows in a westerly direction, passing the towns of Areola and Mutwalla. The tide flows no higher than Areola, but canoes carrying 150 bushels can ascend further up.\n\nNewly, (Navalaya).\u2014A town in the province of Bejaapoor, 50 miles N. W. from Bellary. Lat. 15\u00b0 35'. N. Long. 76\u00b0 25'. E.\n\nNeyer.\u2014A small province in Hindostan, situated about the 24th degree of north latitude, and hitherto but imperfectly explored. To the south it adjoins the province of Cutch, and to the east Gujrat; its northern and western boundaries are unknown. This country generally is of an arid and sandy nature, intersected by no rivers or streams\u2014water being procured from wells, which in many seasons afford but a precarious supply. Nor are the inhabitants better than the country, consisting principally of Coolees, a proportion of Rajpoots, and of late years Mahommedans, who are all professed thieves and depredators. The principal town in this province is Wow, to the westward of which are Bakasir, Gurrah, and Rhardra; the latter being about 40 miles west from Wow.\n\nNeyer abounds with horses of a quality superior to most places in Gujrat, which enables the plundering Rajpoots to extend their ravages over a great tract of country; occasionally as far as Jhingwarra in Gujrat. The Coolees are armed with the teerkampta, and with a curved stick like the blade of a sabre, which is smoked and made extremely hard. This weapon they can throw 120 yards, at which distance they assert they can break a man's leg, or kill him if they strike the head. (Macmurd, &c.)\n\nNiagur.\u2014A town belonging to the Nagpoor Maharattas, situated in the province of Gundwana, 28 miles W. N. W. from Rutunpoor. Lat. 22\u00b0 22'. N. Long. 82\u00b0 11'. E.\n\nNicobar Islands.\u2014These islands are situated in the S. E. quarter of the Bay of Bengal, between the sixth and tenth degrees of north latitude, and occupy the intervening space from the N. W. point of Sumatra to the most southerly of the Andaman Islands. The largest of\nThis cluster is named Sambelong, but those most visited by Europeans are Carnicobar and Nancowry. There are nine other islands of moderate size, besides a multitude of very small ones, as yet without any distinct appellation.\n\nMost of these islands are hilly, and some of the mountains are of a considerable elevation; but Tricnt, Tassouin, and Carnicobar, are flat, and covered with cocoa nut trees. The other islands have likewise a large proportion of cocoa and Areca palms, with timber trees of various kinds, some of them of an enormous size. The vallies and sides of the hills are so thickly covered with them, that the sun-beams cannot penetrate through their foliage. In some places they are so thickly interwoven with rattans and bushrope, that they appear spun together, and render the woods almost dark. The leaves, twigs, and fruit falling down, rot below, which circumstance contributes to make the island extremely unhealthy, and absolutely pestilential to a European constitution. There are trees of great height and size in the woods, of a compact substance, and fit for naval purposes; some have been cut of 34 feet circumference.\n\nThere are none of the wild beasts here so common on the Indian continent, such as leopards and tigers. Monkies are found in the southernmost islands of Sambelong, Tarup, and Katshall. In some others there are large flocks of buffaloes and other cattle originally brought thither by the Danes, but which have run wild in the woods since the colony was abandoned. Dogs and swine are also found in most of the islands. Snakes are plenty, but not so numerous or venomous as on the Coast of Coromandel. Alligators are numerous, and of great size, and crabs swarm over some of the islands. The number and variety of shell fish is so great, that here the most beautiful collections may be made with very little trouble.\n\nThe inhabitants of the Nicobars are of a copper colour, with small eyes, small flat noses, large mouths, thick lips, and black teeth; well proportioned in their bodies, rather short than tall, and with large ears. They have strong black hair; the men have little or no beard; they shave their eye brows, but never cut their nails. The hinder part of the head is compressed, which is done to the occiput at the birth. They dwell in huts of an oval form covered with cocoa nut leaves, and supported on posts about five or six feet from the ground. The occupation of the men consists chiefly in building and repairing their huts, fishing and trading to the neighbouring islands. The women are employed in preparing the victuals, and cultivating the ground. The men are short lived, seldom exceeding 50 years, but the females live longer; the population of the islands is however very scanty. There is a considerable traffic carried on among the islands; the chief articles of which are cloth, silver coin, iron, tobacco, and some other commodities which they obtain from Europeans; and also the produce of their own islands\u2014such as cocoa nuts, areca nut, fowls, hogs, canoes, spears, bird nests, ambergris, and tortoise shell.\n\nThe chief production of these islands are the cocoa nut and areca nut trees. Most of the country ships that are bound to Pegue from the different coasts of India, touch at the Nicobar Islands in order to procure a cargo of cocoa nuts, which they purchase at the rate of four for a leaf of tobacco, and 100 for a yard of blue cloth. Wild cinnamon and sassafras also grow here. In addition to these there is a nutritive fruit called by the Portuguese the mellori, which in some respects resembles the jaca fruit of Bengal, and grows on a species of palm abundant in the woods. Both the dogs and hogs are fed on cocoa nuts, and the quality of the pork is excellent. Wild pigeons are very abundant from June\nto September. Tobacco is the current medium of all exchange and barter.\n\nTen or 12 huts compose a village, each of which has a captain, who carries on the bartering trade with the ships that arrive, but he has otherwise no peculiar privileges. The chief food of the inhabitants is the mellori bread, which is very palatable, together with cocoa nuts and yams. The clothing of the men consists of a narrow piece of cloth, about three yards long. This they wrap round their waists; then passing it between their legs and through the girth behind, leave the end of it to drag after them; from which circumstances originated the fabulous stories of men with tails, related by Kioping, a Swedish navigator. The elephantiasis is a common disease on these islands.\n\nThe inhabitants of the Nicobars do not follow any of the systems of religion prevalent on the neighbouring continent, or among the Eastern Isles, but their notions of a divine being are extremely perplexed and unintelligible. Their paters (an appellation borrowed from the Portuguese) act in the treble capacity of conjuror, physician, and priest. For the expulsion of evil spirits they depend chiefly on exorcisms, the process of effecting which is accompanied by most horrible grimaces. Mr. Haensel, the Danish missionary, relates, that he was present when one of these physicians undertook to cure a woman who was very unwell. After a succession of most hideous faces, the sorcerer produced a large yam, which he held up, pretending that he had extracted it from the body of the woman, and that the enchanted yam had been the cause of her disorder.\n\nThe missionaries never managed to acquire any considerable proficiency in the language of the natives, which they found attended with peculiar difficulties. It is remarkably poor in words, and the natives are asserted to be so indolent, that as long as they can express what they mean by signs, they are unwilling to open their mouths for the purpose of speaking. Both men and women carry always in their mouths a large quid of betel, which renders their speech a species of indistinct sputtering. In their common jargon there are many Malay words, and other phrases borrowed from European and other strangers. It is said they have no expression for numbers beyond 40, except by multiplication.\n\nA commercial establishment was formed on these islands by the Danes, in 1756, who new named them Frederic's Islands; but the attempt was unsuccessful, and almost all the colonists from Tranquebar soon died. A new arrangement was formed, in 1768, in conjunction with the Baptist missionaries; but they died so fast, that, in 1771, only two Europeans and four Malabar servants survived. A few indefatigable and intrepid missionaries continued to reside on the islands, who received supplies from Tranquebar, and also additional brethren in place of those who died; but the mortality continuing incessant, and no progress having been made in the conversion of the natives, the mission was finally abandoned in 1787. During the comparatively short period this mission existed, 11 of these worthy men found their graves in the Island of Nancowry; and 13 more shortly after their return to Tranquebar, in consequence of malignant fevers and obstructions in the liver, contracted on that island. (Haensel, Fontana, &c. &c.)\n\nNIDYCAVIL, (Nadicavil, the Temple on the River).\u2014A small village in North Coimbetoor, situated on the portion between the Karnata and Chera countries, two of the principal divisions in ancient Hindoo geography. Lat. 11\u00b0. 51'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 42'. E.\n\nNILCUND, (Nilacantha).\u2014A place of pilgrimage, of great sanctity, in northern Hindostan; named also\nGossair Othan, and situated among the Himalaya mountains in the frontiers of Tibet. Lat. 27\u00b0. 51'. N. Long. 85\u00b0.50. E. The cold of this place is described as too great to admit of the pilgrims resting here beyond a single day. Avalanches are common on the road, and glaciers both of ice and snow occur in various parts of this Alpine region. Nilcund is visited about the end of July and beginning of August; yet the road is passable with great difficulty, on account of the depth of the snow, although the mountain on which it stands is not situated in a higher latitude than 28\u00b0. N. Soorechund, a small lake, whence the Tadi River rises, is situated a little more elevated than Nilcund, at the distance of three miles. About four miles from this place there is a colossal stone statue of Ganesa. The name means blue throat, a title of Mahadeva's, derived from an exploit performed by him, and related in the Hindoo mythological poems. (Kirkpatrick, &c.)\n\nNilcundah.\u2014A district in the Nizam's dominions, in the province of Hyderabad, situated about the 17th degree of north latitude, and in general but thinly inhabited and cultivated.\n\nNilcundah.\u2014A town in the province of Hyderabad, 42 miles S. E. from Hyderabad, and the capital of a district of the same name. Lat. 16\u00b0.55'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 15'. E.\n\nNirmul.\u2014A town in the Nizam's dominions, in the province of Nandere; four miles N. from the Godavery, and 130 miles S. by E. from Nagpoor. Lat. 19\u00b0. 18'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 33'. E.\n\nNiselout, (or Noussa Laut) Isle.\u2014One of the smallest of the Amboyna Isles, which, during the 17th century, with Saparna Isle, yielded one half of all the cloves exported.\n\nNizam.\u2014See Province of Hyderabad.\n\nNizampatam.\u2014A town in the Northern Circars, situated on the west side of one of the mouths of the Krishna River, 40 miles W. S. W. from Masulipatam. Lat. 15\u00b0. 56'. N. Long. 80\u00b0. 35'. E. At this place a considerable coasting trade is carried on in the craft navigated by the natives.\n\nNoakote, (Navacata, the new Fort).\u2014A small town, temple, and valley, in northern Hindostan, in the district of Nepaul. Lat. 27\u00b0. 43'. N. Long. 85\u00b0. 30'. E. The town of Noakote is not of any great extent; but it contains some of the largest and best-looking houses in Napaul. Its situation is of importance, as commanding the only entrance in this quarter from Upper as well as Lower Tibet, and standing close to Mount Dhyboon, by which the Chinese army was obliged to descend in 1792, when penetrating Nepaul. The temple of Noakote is dedicated to Mahamaya, or Bhavani, and is a brick building on the face of a hill, with nothing remarkable in its appearance. From the roof there are numerous offerings to the goddess suspended, consisting principally of brass vessels and weapons of various sorts; among the latter some trophies acquired from the Chinese.\n\nThe Valley of Noakote is about six miles in length, by one and a quarter in breadth. The soil of this valley is extremely fruitful, and, notwithstanding its vicinity and exposure to the snowy mountains, which enclose it to the northward, it is capable of bearing all the vegetable productions of the Bahar province. The river of Noakate is held in particular estimation. This valley, although so near to the hills, is reckoned one of the lowest in the vicinity of Nepaul Proper; and this fact will account for the great temperature in the Valley of Noakote, compared with that of Nepaul. After the middle of April it is scarcely habitable, on account of the heat. Besides rice, considerable quantities of sugar-cane are raised in the Valley of Noakote and its neighbourhood; the gour, or brown sugar, brought to market here, is in a more refined\nstate than that which is usually met with in Bengal. The garlic has remarkably large cloves, and the pineapples, guavas, and mangoes, are excellent. (Kirkpatrick, &c.)\n\nNoanagur, (Navanagara).\u2014A town in the province of Gujrat, district of Italliar, situated on the S.E. side of the Gulf of Cutch. Lat. 22\u00b0. 20'. N. Long. 70\u00b0. 15'. E.\n\nThe district of Noanagur consists of four divisions, viz. Nuggur, Kumballia (or Surya), Sutchana, and Joovia\u2014the last of which has been alienated by the Khows family. The country inland from this city is extremely rocky, but it produces plentiful crops of joaree, growing apparently out of the stones, so entirely is the soil concealed. What is sown in the narrow valleys in October is reaped in May and June. In the neighbourhood of the small villages the sugar-cane is cultivated. This crop is so hazardous, that in India it is usually only raised under peaceful governments, where the peasantry are in good circumstances, and secure of reaping when they have sowed. The expenses of agriculture here are comparatively small, water being so near the surface, and the Gujrat Peninsula generally having many small streams with low banks, so as to admit of irrigation.\n\nThe town of Noanagur is asserted by the natives to be three coss in circumference, and defended by a wall of no great strength, erected 30 years ago. It contains many weavers, who manufacture a considerable quantity of coarse and fine cloth, some sorts of a very beautiful fabric. From hence Cottywar is supplied with this article, which is also exported to other parts of Gujrat. The small river Nagne flows under the walls of Noanagur, and it is supposed by the natives to possess some quality peculiarly favourable to the dying of cloth, for the excellence of which this town is celebrated.\n\nAll the Noanagur villages within 12 or 15 miles of the Run have walls for their defence. The cultivators generally pay a third of the produce to government, which appoints a person to value the crop; besides this, a tax is laid on animals, and another on men. Corees are struck in Cutch under the authority of the Row, and others under the authority of Jam of Noanagur. It is a small, handsome, silver coin, with Hindu characters, and its average value three to a surat rupee.\n\nThe appellation of jam to the chieftain of Noanagur, is a title which has descended from his ancestors. The Hindoos derive it from a sanscrit source, and the Mahommedans from Jamsheed, a renowned sovereign of Persia. By an agreement executed in 1808, Jessajee, the reigning Jam of Noanagur, engaged with the Bombay government not to permit, instigate, or connive at any act of piracy committed by any person under his authority; and also to abstain from plundering vessels in distress. Reciprocal freedom of trade to be permitted by both parties. (Macmurdo, Treaties, &c.)\n\nNogarcott, (Nagaracata).\u2014A town in Northern Hindostan, in the Rajah of Nepaul's dominions; but since 1792 tributary to China, 60 miles east from Catmandoo. Lat. 28\u00b0. 2'. E. Long. 86\u00b0. 5'. E.\n\nNomurdies, (Namrudiya).\u2014A migratory Mahommedan tribe, who occupy part of Baloochistan, about the 26th degree of north latitude. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, they are described as follows:\n\n\"Another chain of mountains runs from Schwan to Sewee, where it is called Khuttee. Here dwell a tribe named Nomurdy, who can raise 300 cavalry and 7000 infantry. At the foot of this territory is another tribe of Belootchies, named Tehzeng, who have a thousand choice troops. There is another range of mountains, one extremity of which is on Cutch, and the other joins the territories of the Kulmainies, where it is called Karch. It is inhabited by 4000 Belootchies.\" (Abul Fazel, &c. &c.)\nNUDDA.\n\nNooldroogh, (Naladurga).\u2014A district in the Nizam's dominions, in the province of Bejapoor, situated between the 17th and 18th degrees of north latitude, and bounded on the south by the Becnah River. The principal towns are Nooldrog and Sackar.\n\nNooldroog.\u2014A town in the Nizam's dominions, in the province of Bejapoor, 73 miles N. E. from the city of Bejapoor. Lat. 17\u00b0.42'. N. Long. 76\u00b0.37'. E.\n\nNoony, (Lavani, brackish).\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Rajeshy, 74 miles W. N. W. from Moorshedabad. Lat. 24\u00b0.28'. N. Long. 87\u00b0. 8'. E.\n\nNoontal.\u2014A small and mountainous district, situated about the 35th degree of north latitude, between the eastern extremity of Cashmere and the western frontier of Lahdack. It is also named Nicontai; but respecting it nothing further is known.\n\nNoorgool.\u2014A district in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Bejapoor, situated between the 16th and 17th degrees of north latitude; bounded on the north by the Krishna River, and intersected by the small River Gutpurba. The chief town is Gohawk.\n\nNoorabad.\u2014A large village in the province of Agra, situated on the south bank of the Sank River, over which is a bridge of seven arches, well built of stone, 17 miles N.W. from Gohud. Lat. 26\u00b0. 23'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 6'. E. Adjoining to this village is a large garden laid out by Aurungzebe, within which is a monument to the memory of Goona Begunn, a princess celebrated for her personal and mental accomplishments. Many of her compositions in the Hindostan language are still sung and admired. The shrine bears this inscription in Persian, \"Alas! alas! Goona Begum.\"\n\nThe face of the country here is bare, being destitute of trees, and almost without cultivation. Near the road, south, are several small forts, some of mud, and some of stone, possessed by petty chiefs, who derive a precarious revenue from predatory attacks. (Hunter, &c.)\n\nNornagur, (Nurnagur, the City of Light).\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Tipperah, 50 miles E. by N. from Dacca. Lat. 23\u00b0.43'. E. Long. 91\u00b0. 5'. E.\n\nNoori.\u2014A village in the province of Sinde, situated on the banks of the Fulalee, 15 miles below Hyderabadd. Lat. 25\u00b0. 8'. N.\n\nAt this place travellers proceeding to Luckput Bunder and the Gulf of Cutch, quit the Fulalee, and enter a branch running to the southward of Noori, in a direction S. E. which is called the Goonee. About one mile to the south of this place, at the village of Seidpoor, the Goonee is about 150 yards broad, and two fathoms deep; in the month of August. The banks are but little cultivated, and are overgrown with bushes of the lye. (Maxfield, &c.)\n\nNowadah.\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, district of Bahar, 54 miles S. S. E. from Patna.

W. side of the Mahanuddy River, 30 miles S. S. E. from Ruttunpoor. Lat. 21\u00b0. 55'. N. Long. 82\u00b0.55'. E.\n\nNowpoorah, (Naupura, the Town of Boats).\u2014A town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Khandesh, 46 miles E. from Surat. Lat. 21\u00b0.6'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 45'. E.\n\nNuckergaut, (Lakrighat).\u2014A town in Northern Hindostan, in the province of Serinagur. Lat. 36\u00b0. 3'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 5'. E. There is a ferry here across the Ganges, which in February, during the dry season, is here about 200 yards wide.\n\nNudda, (Navadvipa, the New Island).\u2014A district in the province of Bengal, situated between the 22d and 24th degrees of north latitude. It is bounded on the north by Rajishy; on the south by Hooghly and\nthe Sunderbunds; to the east by Jessore; and on the west it is separated from Burdwan by the Hooghly River. In the ancient records of Bengal this district is named Oukerah; but more recently received that of Kishenagur from the zemindar who held it. In the beginning of the 18th century it was bestowed on Ragooram, a Brahmin, the ancestor of the present family. This district is large, and wonderfully fertile in all the dearer productions of the Indian soil. It enjoys, besides, an easy and quick transportation by the rivers Hooghly, the Jellinghy, and the Issamutty; yet the revenue produced bears no comparative proportion to that realized in the adjacent district of Burdwan, although the latter does not enjoy the benefit of so excellent an inland navigation. In 1784, by Major Rennel's mensuration, this district contained 3115 square miles; the chief towns at present are Kishenagur, Nuddeah, and Santipoor.\n\nIn 1801, by the directions of the Marquis Wellesley, their governor-general, the board of revenue in Bengal circulated various questions on statistical subjects to the collectors of the different districts. The result of their replies tended to establish the fact, that the Nuddca district contained 764,000 inhabitants, in the proportion of two Mahomedans to seven Hindoos, and that the zemindar's profit on their land, in general, exceeded 10 per cent. (J. Grant, &c.)\n\nNuddca.\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Nuddca, situated at the Jellinghy and Cossimbazar Rivers, with the Hooghly, 60 miles N. from Calcutta. Lat. 23\u00b0. 25'. N. Long. 88\u00b0. 24'. E. This was the capital of a Hindoo principality anterior to the Mogul conquest of Hindostan, and was taken and entirely destroyed, A.D. 1204, by Mahommed Bukhtyar Khiljee, the first Mahommedan invader of Bengal. In modern times it has been the seat of a Brahmin seminary of learning, but of a very inferior description to Benares. (Abul Fazel, J. Grant, &c.)\n\nNughz.\u2014An Afghan district in the province of Kabul, situated between the 33rd and 34th degrees of north latitude. By Abul-Fazel it is described under the name of Tooman Nughz, yielding a revenue of 854,000 dums; but Major Wilford thinks, that the true name of the capital of this district is Bughz, or Bughzan, and that of the district Iryab.\n\nNughz.\u2014An Afghan city in the province of Kabul, district of the same name, situated on the north side of the Cow or Cowmul River, 100 miles S. E. from the city of Kabul. Lat. 33\u00b0. 17'. N. Long. 69\u00b0. 28'. E.\n\nNujibabad.\u2014A town in the province of Delhi, 95 miles N. E. from the city of Delhi, and 25 S. by E. from Hurdwar. Lat. 29\u00b0. 39'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 16'. E.\n\nThis place was built by Nujeb ud Dowlah, with the view of attracting the commerce between Cashmere and Hindostan. In length it is about six furlongs, with some regular broad streets, enclosed by barriers at different distances, and forming distinct bazars. In the neighbourhood are the remains of many considerable buildings. A traffic of some extent is carried on here in wood, bamboos, iron, copper, and tineal, brought from the hills. It is also the centre of a trade from Lahore, Kabul, and Cashmere, to the east and south-east parts of Hindostan. Nujib ud Dowlah, the founder, lies buried here in a grave without ornament of any kind. The situation of the town is low, and the surrounding country swampy. (Hardwicke, Foster, &c.)\n\nNuldinagar, (Naladanga).\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, 74 miles N. E. by N. from Calcutta. Lat. 23\u00b0. 25'. N. Long. 89\u00b0. 7'. E.\n\nNundabar, (Nandavar).\u2014A town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Khandesh, 76 miles E.\nfrom Surat. Lat. 21\u00b0. 17'. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 15'. E.\n\nNundaporum.\u2014A town in the Northern Circars, 82 miles W. from Cicacole. Lat 18\u00b0. 23'. N. Long. 82\u00b0. 40'. E.\n\nNundydroog, (Nandidurga).\u2014A strong hill fort in Mysore Rajah's dominions, 94 miles N. E. from Seringapatam. Lat. 13\u00b0. 22'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 53'. E.\n\nThis place is built on the summit of a mountain, about 1700 feet high, three-fourths of its circumference being inaccessible. In 1791 this fortress ranked, in point of strength, next to Savendroog, Chitteldroog, and Kistnagherry; and was then taken by storm, by a detachment under the command of Major Gowdie, after an obstinate defence of three weeks. When Hyder took it from the Maharattas, it was after a tedious blockade of three years.\n\nAmong the hills of Nundydroog there is much fertile land now covered with bamboos and useless trees, but which is quite capable of cultivation. Near to this place, among the hills of Chinrayaconda, the Pennar River is said to spring, called Utara Pinakani in the sanscrit. This river runs towards the north; and the Palar, which also springs from Nundy, runs to the south. These hills may, therefore, be looked upon as the highest part of the country in the centre of the land south of the Krishna. The sources of the Cavery and Toombuddra rivers, towards the western side, are probably higher. (Dirom, F. Buchman, &c. &c.)\n\nNurpoor.\u2014A small district in the Seik territories, in the province of Lahore, situated between the 32d and 33d degrees of north latitude, and bounded on the north by the River Ravey.\n\nNurpoor.\u2014A town in the province of Lahore, the capital of a district of the same name, and 75 miles E. N. E. from the city of Lahore. Lat. 32\u00b0. 12'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 2'. E.\n\nThis town is situated on the top of a hill, which is ascended by stone steps, and has the appearance of opulence and industry. Towards the S. E. the country is open and pleasant, with a winding stream of fine water, the heat being much moderated by the cool breezes from the north-west hills; which, during a considerable part of the year, are covered with snow. The Nurpoor districts are bounded to the north by the Ravey; on the east, by the Chambah country; on the west, by some small Hindoo districts, lying at the head of the Punjab and the River Beyah; and on the south by Hurreepoor. In 1783 the revenues of Nurpoor were estimated at four lacks of rupees. (Foster, &c.)\n\nNurrab, (Nava).\u2014A town possessed by native Goand chiefs in the province of Gundwana, tributary to the Nagpoor Rajah, 78 miles S. by E. from Ruttnumpoor. Lat. 21\u00b0. 2'. N. Long. 82\u00b0. 45'. E.\n\nNusserabad, (Naserabad).\u2014A town in the Maharatta dominions, in the province of Berar, 42 miles S.W. from Boorhanpoor. Lat. 20\u00b0. 56'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 51'. E.\n\nNusserabad, or Sackur.\u2014A town in the Nizam's dominions, in the province of Bejapoort, 43 miles E. N. E. from the city of Bejapoort. Lat. 17\u00b0. 20'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 20'. E.\n\nNusserpoor, (Nasirpura).\u2014A district in the province of Sinde, situated principally between the 26th and 27th degrees of north latitude, and intersected by the River Indus. It is described by Abul Fazel, in 1582, as \"Sircar Nusserpoor, containing seven mahals; revenue, 7,834,600 dains.\"\n\nNusserpoor.\u2014A town in the province of Sinde, the capital of a district of the same name, and situated near the banks of the Indus. Lat. 25\u00b0. 28'. N. Long. 69\u00b0. 10'. E.\nOAKAMUNDEL.\n\nOaka, (Oka).\u2014A town and small district in the province of Gujrat, separated from the main land by the Run. Lat. 22\u00b0. 14'. N. Long. 69\u00b0. 30'. E.\n\nTwelve miles south from Positra the breadth of the Run is five miles and a half, the bottom being firm sand, with very little mud. The highest spring tides flood it to the depth of 16 or 18 inches; at other times it is dry, or merely moist, and may be marched across with ease. The Oaka shore is much more uneven and abrupt than the other, and is thickly covered with the milk bush and similar wild shrubs. After ascending the coast, the descent into the country is gradual\u2014the general level of the country being much lower than the beach of the Run.\n\nThe soil of Oaka is in general light red, and of no great depth; and jowaree and bajeree are the only crops it is capable of yielding. There is but little cultivation, however\u2014the inhabitants being a savage race, and much addicted to piracy. Camels of an inferior description are bred in Oaka, the sea-beach and sandy slips, covered with shrubs, being favourable to the rearing of that animal, which requires little care, and is suffered to roam wild among the jungles, where there are no tigers; but leopards have occasionally been seen. It is also well stocked with partridges, quails, hares, and hogs. The rock, which abounds in the Oaka district, is much impregnated with iron ore, but very little is fused beyond what the blacksmiths require for building and repairing boats.\n\nThe population here consists chiefly of Wageres, a Hindoo race of men, who are originally from Cutch, but who appear to possess as many Mahommedan as Hindoo principles. Their appearance and manner of life are barbarous in the extreme, and they may be said to live by plunder. During the monsoon, however, when their boats are laid up, they retire to their small villages, and cultivate grain for their own use. They pay no revenue, their law being plough and eat.\n\nThe piracies of Oaka are of a very ancient date, and the natives continue prone to this mode of life, to which they are stimulated by the numerous advantages they possess for carrying it on. The reliance they place on the power of their deity at Dwaraca is one of the strongest incentives\u2014his priests and attendants being the chief instigators of piracy. In return, they receive a certain portion of all plundered property, as a recompense for the protection received from Ruanchor (the deity), while the expedition was at sea. Before setting off, it is a common practice for the pirates to promise a larger share than the god can claim by right, if he will ensure success to their trip. Many vessels are fitted out in his name, as sole owner, and actually belong to the temple, which receives the plunder they bring back. Recently, these predatory expeditions have been greatly restrained by the British naval power; but the inhabitants retain all their ancient propensity to the practice. (Maemurdo, &c., &c.)\n\nOakamundel, (Okamandala).\u2014A district in the Gujrat Peninsula, extending along the south side of the Gulf of Cutch, and situated between the 22d and 23d degrees of north latitude.\n\nThis district begins at Kumballia, from whence W. by S. the country consists of hill and dale, with a hard rocky soil. It presents a very wild aspect, few villages, no cultivation, and abundance of the milk bush, well stocked with partridges, hares, and other species of game. This state of desolation was caused by the Positra plunderers, which reduced a considerable portion of the district to a waste, covered with jungle, in some places scarcely penetrable.\nThese robbers were expelled by the British in 1809.\n\nThe word oka signifies anything bad or difficult, in which sense it is applied to this wild and uncouth district. In modern times the term Okamundel is principally applied to the western extremity of the Gujrat Peninsula, separated from the main land by a run, or swamp, formed by the sea making a breach from the north-west shore, near Pindletarkuk; and, extending in a S.E. direction, again connects itself with the sea at Muddee, which is about 14 miles distant from Pindletarkuk. The breadth of this channel gradually decreases; at Muddee it is not more than a mile, and is separated from the ocean by a low bank, about 50 yards wide, which is wearing away. From the earliest period of history commerce and agriculture have been disregarded in this part of Gujrat by the inhabitants, who, being mostly fishermen, addicted themselves also to piracy. (Maemurdo, &c.)\n\nOBY ISLE.\u2014An island in the Eastern Seas, situated principally between the first and second degrees of south latitude, and the 128th and 129th of east longitude. In length it may be estimated at 65 miles, by 11 miles the average breadth. On this island live many runaway slaves from Ternate, who cultivate cloves, which they sell to the Bugesses. It is claimed of the Sultan of Batachian, who has a pearl fishery established on the coast. On the west side of Oby the Dutch had a small fort. (Forrest, &c.)\n\nOCLASEER.\u2014A town in the province of Gujrat, district of Broach, 5 miles S. by W. from Broach. Lat. 21\u00b0 37'. N. Long. 73\u00b0 10'. E.\n\nODEYPOR.\u2014A small town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Malwah, 24 miles S. E. from Seronge. Lat. 23\u00b0 58'. Long. 78\u00b0 20'. E. This place stands on the side of a rock, where there is also a Hindoo temple of some celebrity. There is here a large tank, and plenty of fine wells; and about two miles north there is a nullah, containing water to the end of February. (MSS. &c.)\n\nODEYPOR, (Udayapura).\u2014A Rajpoot principality, in the province of Ajmeer, of which it occupies the south-eastern quarter. A considerable portion of the Odeypoor territories anciently bore the appellation of Mewar; and the sovereign is frequently styled the Ranaah of Chitore, under which heads respectively further details will be found.\n\nThe present Odeypoor territories may be estimated at 110 miles in length from north to south, by 70 from east to west, but must be considered as in a perpetual state of fluctuation. To the north they are bounded by the Ajmeer district and the chiefship of Kishenagur; on the north west and west by Jondpoor; on the south and south east by the province of Malwah; on the south west by Gujrat; and on the north east by Kotah and Bundee.\n\nThe face of the Odeypoor territories is in general mountainous; but, when properly cultivated, extremely fertile. It yields sugar, indigo, tobacco, wheat, rice, barley; there are also iron mines, with plenty of fuel; and 30 miles north of Odeypoor sulphur is found, but it is of an inferior quality to that procured from Surat. The country is naturally strong. The city of Odeypoor, which is situated in an amphitheatre of hills, is guarded in the approach by a deep and dangerous defile, which admits only of a single carriage passing at a time; yet so extensive is the circuit protected by this pass, that between four and 500 villages are comprehended within its range. The generality of the cattle are inferior to those of the more western countries.\n\nThe lands throughout Odeypoor are held on the feudal system, but a considerable part is tributary to the Maharattas, who possess also many of the most opulent towns. In the present distracted state of the Rana's dominions the revenue is rarely paid, except when levied by force; and,\nthe feudatories as seldom obey his summons to appear at court. The nobility are Rajpoots, or Rajapootras, called Rhafores in the vulgar dialect. They are of the tribe Sesodya, which is esteemed the purest and most noble. The weapons of an Odeypoor Rajpoot consist of a matchlock, lance, and sabre, but principally of the two latter. The cultivators are composed of Rajpoots, Jauts, Brahmins, and Bheels. The chief towns are Odeypoor, Chitore, Jalore, Bilarah, and Shahpoorah, and the great mass of the inhabitants Hindoos of the Brahminical persuasion. (G. Thomas, Broughton, Willford, &c.)\n\nOdeypoor.\u2014A town in the province of Ajmeer, situated on the south side of the Banass River. Lat. 25\u00b0. 28'. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 5'. E. This place stands within an amphitheatre of hills, which has but one road that admits a carriage; but there are two other passes through which single horses can go. The wells in the neighbourhood, although but a small distance from the surface of the earth, are strongly impregnated with mineral particles, which flow with the water from the hills.\n\nThe Rana of Odeypoor is of the Sesodya tribe, and is considered as the most noble of all the Rajpoot chiefs; but is much inferior in power to the Rajahs of Jyenagur and Joudpoor, particularly the latter. His family is also highly regarded by the Mahommmedans, in consequence of a tradition, that he is descended in the female line from the celebrated Nushirvan, who was King of Persia at the birth of Mahommmed, and thus to have in that line a common origin with the Scids descended from Hossein, the son of Ali. In 1807 the Rajahs of Jyenagur and Joudpoor continued their mutual pretensions to marry the daughter of the Rana of Odeypoor, which involved them in hostilities, by which the Maharatta plunderers profited. (G. Thomas, Franklin, MSS. &c.)\n\nOdeypoor.\u2014A town in the territories of the Nagpoor Maharattas, in the province of Gundwana, 73 miles N.E. from Ruttnupoor. Lat. 22\u00b0. 37'. N. Long. 83\u00b0. 40'. E.\n\nOffak.\u2014A harbour on the Island of Wageeoo, where there is a stream of fresh water, and good anchorage.\n\nOgurrapupura, (Agurupura).\u2014A town possessed by independent zamindars, in the province of Orissa, 70 miles N.W. from Cuttack. Lat. 21\u00b0. 23'. N. Long. 85\u00b0. 35'. E.\n\nOkirah.\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Burdwan, 105 miles N.W. from Calcutta. Lat. 23\u00b0. 38'. N. Long. 87\u00b0. 15'. E.\n\nOlpar, (Ulupara).\u2014A town in the province of Gujrat, district of Broach, seven miles north from Surat. Lat. 21\u00b0. 18'. Long. 73\u00b0. 1'. E.\n\nBy the treaty concluded with the Peshwa, on the 16th Dec. 1803, supplemental to that of Bassein, the pargannah of Olpar, yielding a revenue of 316,000 rupees, was as a particular favour restored to the Peshwa; but as, on account of its proximity to the city of Surat, it was of great value to the British, it was agreed that it should be so managed and governed by the Maharatta authority, as to conduce to the convenience of that city, and to the promotion of an amicable commercial intercourse: the sovereignty of the River Tuptee to remain with the British. (Treaties, &c.)\n\nOmby Isle.\u2014An island in the Eastern Seas, situated off the N.W. coast of Timor, between the eighth and ninth degrees of south latitude. In length it may be estimated at 45 miles, by 13 the average breadth.\n\nOmferseer.\u2014A village in the province of Cutch, situated about four miles south from Luckput Bundar. Lat. 25\u00b0. 43'. N. The soil of the adjacent lands is a red sandy loam, and is tolerably well cultivated. There are few trees besides the baubool; but the grass on the hills is good, although thinly scattered.\n\nOmercuntuc, (Amara cantaca).\u2014A celebrated place of Hindoo pil-\ngrimage, in the province of Gundwana, 52 miles N. N. W. from Ruttampoor, and 69 R. by N. from Mundlah. Lat. 22\u00b0. 53'. N. Long. 82\u00b0. 15'. E.\n\nThe country around Omereuntuc is very wild, and thinly inhabited. It is seldom or never frequented by any travellers, except Hindu pilgrims, who go to visit the sources of the Sonne and Nerbudah rivers at this place; the usual road to which is by Ruttampoor. These rivers are said to derive their origin from the water that is collected in, and issues from the cavities of the mountains, which form the elevated table land of Omereuntuc. Of this territory the Nagpoor Rajah claims a part, the Rajah of Sohagepoor another part, and the Goonds a third; but the whole is generally in the possession of the latter. (Blunt, &c.)\n\nOmerpoor, (Amavapura).\u2014A town in the Nizam's territories, in the province of Berar, 82 miles N. E. from Jahapoor. Lat. 26\u00b0. 23'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 10'. E.\n\nOmbattee, (Amavari, Divine).\u2014A large fortified and trading town in the Nizam's dominions, in the province of Berar, 30 miles south from Ellichpoor. Lat. 20\u00b0. 50'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 20'. E. A considerable quantity of cotton of a good length and staple is transported from hence to Bengal by land carriage, being a distance of more than 500 miles. The prime cost at this place is less than 2l. sterling per pound; at Mirzapoor on the Ganges, in the Benares province, it brings from 40 to 45s. per cwt. (Calebroke, &c.)\n\nOmree, (Amari).\u2014A town in the Nizam's dominions, in the province of Berar, 20 miles S. W. from Ellichpoor. Lat. 21\u00b0. 7'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 54'. E.\n\nOmudwara, (Umadwara).\u2014A district in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Malwah, situated between the 24th and 25th degrees of north latitude. This country is of an uneven, hilly surface, and much covered with jungle; but, where cultivated, of great fertility, being intersected by the Sopra and Gillysind rivers. It contains no town of consequence.\n\nOngologur, (Augudaghar).\u2014A town possessed by independent zamindars, in the province of Orissa, 55 miles west from Cuttack. Lat. 20\u00b0. 36'. N. Long. 85\u00b0. 20'. E.\n\nOngole, (Angula).\u2014A district in the Northern Carnatic, situated between the 15th and 16th degrees of north latitude. It was formerly dependent on the Kirpa or Cudapah principality; but was afterwards incorporated with the Carnatic below the Ghauts, and subject to the Nabob of Arcot. The sovereignty of Ongole was finally acquired by the Company in 1801, by treaty with the nabob; and with Nelloor, and including part of the Western Pollauns, now forms one of the collectorships, into which the Carnatic has been subdivided, under the Madras Presidency. It is inferior in point of fertility to Tanjore and several other districts in this province, and has never been remarkable for trade or manufactures. The Mussy and the Gondegannna are the principal rivers, the latter being the boundary line between the Carnatic and the Northern Circars. The chief towns are Ongole, Courchier, and Sintalsheroo.\n\nOngole.\u2014A town in the Carnatic Province, district of Ongole, 173 miles N. by W. from Madras. Lat. 15\u00b0. 31'. N. Long. 80\u00b0. 1'. E. This place formerly possessed fortifications of considerable strength; but the necessity for them having passed away, they were allowed to decay.\n\nOnore, (Hanavara).\u2014A sea-port town in the province of North Canara. Lat. 14\u00b0. 18'. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 25'. E. This was formerly a place of great commerce, where Hyder had established a dock-yard for building ships of war; but it was totally demolished by Tippoo, when it was recovered at the treaty of Mangalore. There is now a custom-house here, and part of the town has\nbeen rebuilt. Boats come from Goa and Rajapoor to purchase rice, betel nut, pepper, cocoa nuts, salt fish, &c., which were formerly much annoyed by piratical boats from the Maharatta coast\u2014an evil that still exists, but not to so great an extent. In this part of Cauara there never were manufactures to any considerable amount, and the trade was wholly destroyed by Tippoo. The Portuguese erected a fort here so early as 1505.\n\nThe Lake of Onore is of great extent, and, like that of Cundapoor, contains many islands, some of which are cultivated. It reaches almost to the Ghauts, and in the dry season is almost salt; but it receives many small streams, which during the rainy season become torrents, and render the whole fresh. It abounds with fish, which, when salted, forms a considerable article of commerce with the inland country. (F. Buchanan, Bruce, &c.)\n\nOnrust Isle.\u2014A very small isle, about a quarter of a mile in circumference, situated two and a half leagues from Batavia. In the centre of the island, and within a fort, stand the Dutch East India Company's warehouses for tin, pepper, and coffee. Here their ships refit, and heave down\u2014there being very good wharfs for that purpose, at which five ships may heave down at a time; there are also large machines for dismastings ships. The Dutch kept an establishment on Onrust of 500 persons, of whom 100 were European carpenters, and the rest slaves. There is above 20 feet of water along the piers, and it rises and falls five feet in 24 hours. Onrust is supposed to be more healthy than Batavia; it is, notwithstanding, a very sickly place. (Captain Hunter, Stavorins, &c.)\n\nOntarree.\u2014A town possessed by independent zemindars, in the province of Gundwana, district of Bilounjah, 12 miles from the western frontier of Palamow, in the Bahar Province. Lat. 24\u00b0. 13'. N. Long. 83\u00b0. 40'. E.\n\nOochinadroog, (Ujayini Durga).\u2014A strong hill fort in the Balaghaut ceded territories, district of Harpo-nully. Lat. 14\u00b0. 32'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 55'. E. This fortress is situated about 12 miles to the eastward of Hurryhur, and has the appearance of great strength; being of considerable height, unconnected and abrupt, particularly to the northward and westward, where it is almost perpendicular. (Moor, &c.)\n\nOochaseer.\u2014A town in the district of Neycr, situated about 25 miles S. W. from Therand, and subject to the chief of Morwarra. It is surrounded by a dry thorn hedge, has a small tank of bad water, and some excellent wells. The inhabitants are Jhuts and Coolees.\n\nOojain, (Ujayini).\u2014A district possessed by the Sindia Maharatta family, in the province of Malwah, situated between the 23d and 24th degrees of north latitude. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Oojain, containing 10 mahals; measurement, 925,622 bce-gahs; revenue, 43,827,960 dams; seyurghal, 281,816 dams. This sircar furnishes 3250 cavalry, and 11,170 infantry.\"\n\nThe soil in the vicinity of the city of Oojain, and over the greatest part of the Malwah Province, is a black vegetable mould, which, in the rainy season, becomes so soft, that travelling is hardly practicable. In drying it cracks in all directions, and the fissures are so wide and deep by the road side, as to make a journey dangerous. The quantity of rain that falls in ordinary seasons is so considerable, and the ground so retentive of moisture, that wells are little used for watering the fields; but this makes the suffering more severe, if the periodical rain fails\u2014there being no wells ready to supply the deficiency. It is singular that the vine in this district produces a second crop of grapes in the rainy season, but they are acidulous, and of an inferior quality. The other\nfruits are the mango, guava, plantain, melon, watermelon, and several varieties of the orange and lime trees. In 1790 the district immediately dependent on Oojain yielded a revenue of five lacks of rupees per annum, and comprehended 175 villages. (Hunter, &c. &c.)\n\nOojain, (Ujjayini).\u2014A city of great celebrity in the province of Malwah, the capital of the dominions of the Sindia Maharatta family. Lat. 23\u00b0 12'. N. Long. 75\u00b0 50'. E. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\u2014\"Oojain is a large city on the banks of the Sopra, and held in high veneration by the Hindoos. It is astonishing that sometimes this river flows with milk.\"\n\nThis city, called in Sanscrit Ujja-yini and Avanti, boasts a most remote antiquity. A chapter in the Hindoo Mythological Poems, named Purans, is devoted to the description of it; and it is mentioned in the Periplus of the Erythrean Sea, as well as in Ptolomy, under the name of Ozene. It is also considered by Hindoo geographers and astronomers as the first meridian. The modern town is situated a mile to the southward of the ancient, which is said to have been overwhelmed by a convulsion of nature, about the time of Rajah Vicramaditya, when it was the seat of arts, learning, and empire. On the spot where the ancient city is supposed to have stood, by digging to the depth of 15 or 18 feet, brick walls, pillars of stone, and pieces of wood of an extraordinary hardness are found. Utensils of various kinds are sometimes dug up in the same places, and ancient coins are frequently discovered.\n\nThe present city of Oojain is of an oblong form, about six miles in circumference, and surrounded by a stone wall with round towers. Within this space there is some wasteground, but the inhabited part occupies the greatest portion, and is much crowded with buildings and population. The houses are built partly of brick and partly of wood, the frame being constructed of wood, and the interstices filled up with bricks, having a roof of lime terrace or tiles. The principal bazar is a spacious regular street, paved with stone, and having houses on each side of two stories in height. The lower stories, the ascent to which is by five or six steps from the street, are used as shops; the upper are the habitations of the owners. The most remarkable buildings are four mosques erected by private individuals, and a great number of Hindoo temples. Sindia's palace makes but a poor appearance, being so much surrounded by other buildings as to be little remarked. The south wall of the city, washed by the Sipparah River, is named Jeysingpoor; and contains an observatory, built by Rajah Jeysingh of Juenagar.\n\nThe officers of government are almost the only Maharatta inhabitants of Oojain. The Mahomedans form a considerable portion of the population, and are principally composed of a particular class named Bohrah. From Surat are imported various kinds of European and Chinese goods, which are frequently to be bought very cheap here. Pearls and assafoctida (the latter the production of Sinde) are brought here by the route of Marwar; and diamonds from Bundelcund pass through this city to Surat. The public bazars are, in general, well supplied with fruits, vegetables, and grain; but, in 1804, when visited by a British embassy, persons were seen dead and dying of hunger in the open streets. The inhabitants explained this circumstance by saying they were strangers, and that the fear each individual had of shewing the appearance of superfluity, occasioned this deplorable want of humanity.\n\nThe hills in this neighbourhood are chiefly composed of granite, but they are covered with vegetable mould of a sufficient depth to admit of cultivation. Adjoining the subterranean ruins, on the banks of the Sipparah, is Rajah Bhirtery's cave.\nIt consists of a long gallery, supported by pillars, with chambers excavated on each side, containing male figures curiously carved in the walls. Here Rajah Bhirtery, the brother of Rajah Vicramaditya, is said to have shut himself up after having relinquished the world. Among the natives a tradition exists, that this cave formerly extended under ground to Benares and Hurdwar.\n\nPtolemy places Oojain about 255 geographical miles from the mouth of the River Mahi, but the real distance is not more than 200 miles. Rajahs of this city are mentioned by Ferishta so early as A.D. 1098, and it was first conquered by the Mahommedans about 1230. The celebrated Rajah Jeyasingh held the city and territory of Oojain of the Emperor Mahommed Shah, but it soon afterwards fell into the power of the Maharattas, and has been possessed for four generations by the Sindia family. Jyapa Sindia is the first of this race upon record, and was a servant of the Peshwa Bajeerows, who appointed him to several military commands. He was followed by his son Junkoje, who was murdered after the battle of Paniput; his uncle Ranojee succeeded to his territories. This chief left two sons, Kedarjee, the father of Anund Row, the father of Dowlet Row Sindia; and Madhajee Sindia, who supplanted his elder brother, and seized on the throne.\n\nMadhajee Sindia lost a leg early in life at the battle of Paniput, so fatal to the Maharattas; but he continued an active persevering commander through life, and attained to so great a degree of power as to overshadow the whole Maharatta empire. By the introduction of European discipline among his troops, he subdued a considerable portion of Hindostan Proper, rendered the Rajpoots tributary, and brought his dominions in contact with those of the Company under the Bengal Presidency. Dying without issue, in 1794, he left his hereditary possessions and conquests to his nephew, Dowlet Row Sindia, who for some years augmented his dominions by unceasing encroachments on his neighbours; until, in 1803, he ventured to try his strength with the British. A short and vigorous war ensued, in the course of which he experienced such signal defeats from Generals Wellesley and Lake, as threatened the utter extinction of his sovereignty.\n\nA treaty of peace was, in consequence, concluded on the 30th Dec., 1803, by which he ceded to the British all the territory situated between the Ganges and Junna, and all his possessions of every description in the country to the northward of those belonging to the Rajahs of Jyenagur, and Joudpoor, and the Ranah of Gohud. He also relinquished to the British government the fort and territory of Broach, and the fort and territory of Ahmednaggar; and all his possessions to the south of the Adjuntee Hills, including the fort and district of Jahnapoor, the town and district of Gandapoor, and all the other districts between that range of hills and the Godavery.\n\nThe fort of Ascerghur, the city of Boorhanpoor, the forts of Pownaghur and Dolhud, and the territories in Khandesh and Gujrat were restored to Sindia. The districts of Dhoolpoor, Barce, Rajah Kerah, and some other lands north of the Chumbul, Sindia and his adherents were to be allowed to hold under the Company's protection. By this treaty also the British government agreed to pay pensions to certain persons attached to the court of Sindia, not to exceed 17 lacks of rupees per annum; and this chief renounced all claims or interference in the affairs of his Majesty Shah Alhum. He also engaged to exclude all Europeans hostile to the British from his service and dominions. During this short war the city of Oojain was occupied by the Bombay army, but it was restored when the peace was established.\nOn the 23rd March, 1804, a treaty of defensive alliance was concluded with Sindia by Colonel Malcolm on the part of the British government; by the conditions of which Sindia agreed to receive, and the British to furnish, a subsidiary force of not less than 6000 regular infantry, to be stationed near the frontier of Sindia's dominions, and the expense defrayed out of the revenues of the country ceded by him. This force to be employed only in executing services of importance; such as the protection of his country from attack, invasion, or rebellion; but not to be employed on trifling occasions. In the event of a war Sindia engaged to join the Company's forces with 6000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry; and he also agreed to submit all differences he might have with the Peshwa to the arbitration of the British government.\n\nMany disputed points still remaining unadjusted, a definitive treaty of alliance was concluded with Dowlet Row Sindia, on the 22d Nov. 1805, by Colonel Malcolm, on the part of the British government; by which the fortress of Gualior, and the territories of Gohud were ceded to Sindia, who agreed to relinquish all claim to the pensions of 15 lacks of rupees, granted by the treaty of Surjee Anjengaum to certain chief officers of his state.\n\nWith the view of preventing any misunderstanding relating to their respective possessions in Hindostan, it was agreed, that the River Chumbul should form the boundary between the two states, from the city of Kotah on the west to the limits of the Gohud territories on the east; Sindia to abandon all claim to the north bank, and the Company to the south, with the exception of the Talooks of Bhadek and Sooseparah; which, being on the banks of the Jumna, were to remain with the British.\n\nBy the fifth article of this treaty Sindia resigns all pretensions to any tribute from the Rajah of Boondee, or any other on the north bank of the Chumbul, as also to the countries of Tonk Ranpoorah, Bahraungaum, Zemeidah, &c. and to the districts of Dhoopoor, Rajah Kerrah, and Baree; all of which to remain in the possession of the Honourable Company. In consideration of this arrangement, the British government engaged to pay Sindia personally and exclusively four lacks of rupees per annum, and also to assign a jaghire of two lacks of rupees to Bauzah Bhye, the wife of Dowlet Row Sindia, and a jaghire of one lack of rupees to Chumnah Bhye, the daughter of that chief.\n\nBy this arrangement it was stipulated, that the British should not interfere in the affairs of the Rajahs of Odypoor, Joudpoor, or Kotah; or of any other chiefs, the tributaries of Sindia, situated in Malwah, Meowar or Marwar; and it also engaged to leave all future differences respecting boundaries between Holear and Sindia to be adjusted by themselves. Since this period nothing remarkable has intervened. Dowlet Row Sindia still occupies the throne, and employs his time chiefly in plundering such of his neighbours as are not under the British protection; but the field of Maharatta devastation is now greatly curtailed.\n\nTravelling distance from Calcutta to Oojain by Mundlah, 997 miles; from Bombay by Boorhaapoor, 500; from Delhi, 440; from Hyderabad, 534; from Nagpoor, 340; and from Poona, 442 miles. (Hunter, Rennel, Treaties, 6th Reg., Ferishta, Wilford, &c. &c.)\n\nOon.\u2014A town in the province of Gujrat, district of Werrcar, 15 miles to the north of Rahdunpoor.\n\nThis place, celebrated for the thievish disposition of its inhabitants, is situated on the borders of the territory distinguished by the name of Kakreche. It is an open town, with one long bazar street, the houses of which are tolerably well constructed, and several have upper stories. It contains about 2000\nhouses, 800 of which are inhabited by Coolees, and can send forth, on an urgent occasion, many match-lock-men. The other inhabitants are Koonbees, Redbarces, and a few Banyans. The present chief of Oon is a Coolie, named Prethi Raj, whose territorial income is about 6000 rupees; besides which he is supposed to realize double the amount from his share of plundered property.\n\nThere are plenty of wells at Oon, and the immediate vicinity is open and cultivated. The chief's palace is an upper-roomed house, surrounded by a square wall, within which enclosure there are also houses for the relations of the family, and stables. (Macnurdo, &c.)\n\nOonaee.\u2014A small village in the province of Gujrat, belonging to the Guicowar, situated 50 miles S. E. from Surat. At this place there is a hot well, which, like all other extraordinary phenomena of nature, is held sacred by the Hindoos, and resorted to by pilgrims of that religion, who are supplied by the officiating priest with the miraculous history of its original formation by Rama Chandra. (Drummond, &c.)\n\nOoniara.\u2014A Rajpoot town in the province of Ajmeer, the rajah of which is related and a feudatory to the Jyenagur family. Lat. 25\u00b0. 51'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 58'. E. This is a large town enclosed by a wall, partly of mud and partly of stone. The rajah has a handsome house within a stone enclosure, surrounded by a ditch. (Hunter, Broughton, &c.)\n\nOreecha, (Arjaya).\u2014A large and populous town belonging to the Rajah of Jyenagur, in the province of Ajmeer. (G. Thomas, &c.)\n\nOrfy, (Arfi).\u2014A small town tributary to the Maharattas, in the province of Agra, 17 miles S. W. from Kalpy on the Jumna. Lat. 25\u00b0. 58'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 35'. E.\n\nORISSA, (Uddessa).\n\nA large province in the Decean, extending from the 16th to the 23d degrees of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by Bengal; to the south by the River Godavery; on the east it has the Bay of Bengal; and on the west the province of Gundwana. In length, from N.E. to S.W. it may be estimated at 530 miles, by 90 the average breadth.\n\nAccording to the Institutes of Acber, Orissa, in its greatest dimensions, in 1592, was divided into five districts, viz. Jellasir, comprising Midnapoor, and the British possessions lying north and east of the River Subhureeka; 2. Buddruck (now Cuttack); 3. Cuttack; 4. Kulling, or Cicacole; 5. Rajamundry. Besides this territory on the sea-coast, Orissa also comprehended a mountainous unproductive region on the western frontier, making part of the Jeharcund, or Jungly country, with the districts of Ruttenpoor and Sumbhulpoor; but the two latter properly belong to Gundwana.\n\nThe interior of this province remains in a very savage state, being composed of rugged hills, uninhabited jungles, and deep water-courses, surrounded by pathless deserts, forests, or valleys, and pervaded by a pestilential atmosphere. It forms a strong natural barrier to the maritime districts, being only traversed during the driest season from February to May by the Lumballies, or inland carriers. There are only two passes properly explored, in the whole length of the great mountainous ridge, extending from the Godavery to the Mahanuddy; the one direct from Chandah to Cicacole; the other oblique from Chotcegshur by the way of Kalahindi; both uniting at the pass of Saloor, or Saurecca. By this pass, during the French possession of the Northern Circars in 1754, a body of Maharattas were introduced; more than half perished from the noxious air of the hills, and the remainder, rather than return by so destructive a road, made a prodigious circuit south by Rajamundry and the Godavery.\nThe principal modern subdivisions of this extensive province are, Cia- \nceole, Rajamundry, Cuttack, Mohur- \nbunge, Midnapoor, and Konjeur; \nunder which heads further topogra- \nphical details will be found. The \nchief rivers are the Godavery, the \nMahamuddy, the Byturnee, and the \nSubunrecka; besides innumerable \nmountain streams of a short course. \nAlthough Orissa may be generally \ndescribed as a barren province, com- \npared with Bengal, yet the maritime \npart equals in fertility any territory \nin the Carnatic, or south of India; \nand the district of Midnapoor is ex- \ncelled by very few in Bengal. The \ncountry between the rivers Gaintee \nand Bamouli is one of the finest \nparts of the province, and is inha- \nbited by a considerable number of \nweavers; chiefly of coarse muslins \nfor turbans; saares are also a staple \nmanufacture. The best bamboos \nused for palanquins come from the \npurgannahs of Tolchan and Hindole. \nThey grow near the summit of the \nrocks, and spring in July, when the \npeople who collect them, having \nselected the strongest shoots, tie \nthem to stakes driven into the \nground, and thus direct their growth \nto the proper shape. In this manner \nthey grow 20 yards long by the \nsetting in of the dry season, when \ntheir tops are cut off. If suffered to \nstand longer the hollow part in- \ncreases, and they become weaker.\n\nIn the back parts of this province, \nbeyond the British dominion, the \nnative Ooreas are a fierce people, \nand possess a considerable degree of \npersonal courage. They are com- \nmonly armed with bows and arrows, \nor swords; the latter being generally \ncarried naked, and are of a shape \nwhich is broad at the end, but nar- \nrow in the middle. They have a \nrooted antipathy to the Maharattas, \nwho plunder and oppress them. The \nOoreas within the Company's juris- \ndiction are a quiet inoffensive race; \nand, with a few peculiar exceptions \nas to manners, resemble the other \nHindoo natives under the British \ndominion. From the strict and re- \ngular administration of justice, and \nthe firm coercion of all violence, this \nresemblance must gradually in- \ncrease, until a British Hindoo shall \nbe perceptibly different from one \nsubject to the caprices of a native \npotentate. The language of this \nprovince, and the character in which \nit is written, are both called Ooreeak.\n\nIn ancient Hindoo History, Uc- \ncala, or Odradea, was nearly co- \nextensive with the modern Orissa; \nthe name Utcala, or Udeala, imply- \ning the great or famous country of \nCala. It was then inhabited by a \npowerful and martial race, who were \nat last extirpated by the Karnas, or \nKings of Magadha. In more recent \ntimes it was governed by a dynasty \nof Hindoo princes of the race of \nGujaputty, who, in 1592, were con- \nquered by Mansingh, the Emperor \nAeber's viceroy in Bengal, to which \ndominion it was then annexed as a \ndependent government; extending \nfrom Tumlook, on the banks of the \nGreat Ganges, to Rajamundry, on \nthe Lesser Ganges, or Gunga Goda- \nvory of the Deccan. It then mea- \nsured along the sea coast near 600 \nmiles, by 40 the medium breadth, \nstretching to the hills westward, and \ncontained the nation of the Ooreas, \na distinct race of Hindoos, differing \nin language, manners, and some pe- \nculiarities of religion, from the other \nBrahminical sects of Hindostan. \nFrom the accounts of ancient Eu- \nropean travellers, fragments of na- \ntional history, and a few remnants \nof former splendour, it was probably \na flourishing country before the Ma- \nhammedan invasion; but soon after \nfell into a state of comparative de- \npression. It does not appear, how- \never, that the Mahommedans ever \ncompletely occupied or colonized this \nprovince, which still remains one of \nthose in which the Hindoo manners \nare preserved in their greatest pu- \nrity, and where the smallest propor- \ntion of Mahommedans are to be \nfound. The Temple of Juggernaut \nis still famous for its antiquity, sane-\ntity, and the great annual resort of pilgrims. After the expulsion of the Afghans from the province of Bengal, during the reign of the Emperor Acher, they retreated into Orissa, and retained possession of the maritime and more fertile portions of it, and also of the Juggernaut temple for many years.\n\nThere is no province in India which exhibits a greater difference, with respect to the proportion of inhabitants in the different districts. Madnapoor, which comprehends less than 7000 square miles, has been found, by actual enumeration, to contain a million and a half of souls; yet it is probable the population of the whole province does not exceed four millions and a half. Three-fourths of this extensive territory are possessed by the British, the remainder by various petty native chiefs in a state of perpetual hostility with each other. The Nagpoor Maharattas claim a sovereignty over the greater part of them, and occasionally levy a tribute when assisted by the presence of an army, without which their authority is contended. (J.

E.\n\nThere is not any substance so coarse as gravel, either in the Delta of the Ganges, or nearer the sea than Oudanulla, which is 400 miles distant by the course of the river. At this place a rocky point, part of the base of the neighbouring hills, projects into the sea.\n\nAt Oudanulla there is a bridge built by Sultan Sujah, the second son of the Emperor Shah Jehan, which is one of the most elegant specimens of modern Mahommedan architecture, and the town has long been famous for a victory obtained, in 1764, over the troops of Meer Cossim, by the small army under the command of Major Adams. (Renel, Hodges, &c.)\n\nOUDE, (Ayodhya).\n\nA province in Hindostan, situated between the 26th and 28th degrees of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by various petty districts tributary to Nepaul, from which it is separated by a range of hills and forests; to the south by Allahabad; on the east it has Barhar; and on the west Delhi and Agra. In length it may be estimated at 250 miles, by 100 miles the average breadth. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"The Soubah of Oude is situated in the second climate. The length, from Sircar Gorakpoor to Canoje, in-\ncludes 135 coss, and the breadth, from the northern mountains of Siddepoor to the Soubah of Allahabad, comprises 115 coss. To the east it has Bahar; to the north lie mountains; Manicpoor bounds it to the south, and Canoje to the west. The large rivers are the Goggrah, the Gomt, and the Sye. In this soubah are five sircars divided into 138 pergunnahs. The amount of the revenue is 5,043,454. It supplies 7660 cavalry, 168,250 infantry, and 59 elephants, and is subdivided into the following districts, viz. 1. Oude; 2. Goraeepoor; 3. Baraitche; 4. Khyrabad; 5. Lucknow.\n\nThe whole surface of this province is flat, extremely fertile, and well watered by large rivers, or by the copious streams which intersect the country. When properly cultivated, the land is extremely productive, yielding crops of wheat, barley, rice, and other grains, sugar-cane, indigo, poppies for opium, and all the richest articles raised in India. The air and climate are suited to the spontaneous generation of nitre, from the brine of which a culinary salt is procured by evaporating the saltpetre brine to a certain degree, which, though at first much contaminated with bitter salt, may be easily refined to a purer state. Lapis lazuli is also a production of this province, the colour procured from which sells in England at about nine guineas per ounce. The principal towns of this province are, Lucknow, Fyzabad, Oude, Khyrabad, Goraeepoor, and Baraitche. It is intersected by the Goggrah, or Devah River, and bounded on the west by the Gauges; besides which there are numerous smaller streams, and several jeels, or small lakes.\n\nThe Hindoo inhabitants of Oude, Benares, and the doab of Agra, are a very superior race, both in their bodily strength and mental qualities, to those of Bengal, and the districts south of Calcutta. The Rajpoots, or military class of them, generally exceed Europeans in stature, have robust frames, and are possessed of every valuable quality in a military point of view. From the long occupation of this province by the Mahomedans, a much greater proportion of that religion are to be found than in the more southern and eastern countries; and from both the above classes a considerable number of the Company's best sepeys are procured. Until the assumption of the government of Oude by the British, the whole region was in a state of political anarchy. Every individual travelled either with the prospect of defending himself against robbers, or of assuming that vocation himself; for both of which events he was provided. The peasantry sowed and reaped with their swords and spears ready for defence or plunder, as occasion offered; and the rents were levied by an irregular banditti under the denomination of an army, which devastated the country it pretended to protect.\n\nOude is much celebrated in the ancient Hindoo histories, as the kingdom of Dasaratha, the father of the great Rama, who extended his empire to the Island of Ceylon, which he conquered. At an early period after the invasion it was subdued by the Mahomedans, and remained with different vicissitudes attached to the throne of Delhi, until the dissolution of that empire after the death of Aurengzebe. The first ancestor upon record of the present reigning family was Saadet Khan, a native of Rishapoor, in the province of Khorasan, who was appointed Soubahdar of Oude, during the reign of Mahomed Shah. He was succeeded by his nephew,\n\nSefdar Jung, who died A.D. 1756, when the throne was ascended by his son,\n\nShujah ud Dowlah, who reigned until 1775. On his decease his son,\n\nAsoph ud Dowlah, was his successor, and reigned until 1797, when he was succeeded for a short time by his spurious son, Vizier Ali, whose\nillegitimacy being discovered, he was dethroned by the British, and the government confided to the late Nabob's brother, Saadet Ali, who was proclaimed Vizier of Hindostan and sovereign of Oude, the 21st Jan. 1798.\n\nIn 1790 the dominions of Oude occupied all the flat country lying on both sides of the Ganges, (with the exception of Rampoor), between that river and the northern mountains; as also the principal part of that fertile tract situated between the Ganges and Jumna (the Doab) to within 40 miles of Delhi. Ever since the pacification between Lord Clive and Shujah ud Dowlah, in 1765, this country had been protected from its external enemies, its internal peace preserved, and its dominions extended by the assistance of a British subsidiary force, the expense of which was defrayed by the Nabobs of Oude. The exigence of the times compelled a large augmentation of this standing army, and the disbursements increased proportionally; but, owing to the mismanagement of the nabob's financial concerns, an uncertainty attended its regular payment, although his territories under a proper administration were not only equal to all the necessary expenditure, but capable of realizing a large surplus. By a fatality attending the British influence in Hindostan, it was frequently obliged, in consequence of remote treaties, to maintain on the native thrones weak and profligate princes, who without that support would, in the natural progression of events, have been supplanted by some more able competitors. Their dominions, in the mean time, suffered by their vices, and their subjects were abandoned to the rapacity of the unprincipled associates of their low pleasures, who by their cruelty and extortion depopulated the country, and drove the inhabitants to a state of desperation. These observations particularly apply to the Oude territories during the long reign of Asoph ud Dowlah; and as an opportunity now occurred, the Bengal Presidency deemed it a duty imposed on them, to endeavour to procure a better system of government for the great mass of the natives, and at the same time remove the uncertainty which attended the payment of the subsidiary force.\n\nA treaty was, in consequence, concluded on the 10th Nov. 1801, by the conditions of which the undermentioned portions of the Nabob of Oude's territories, yielding a gross revenue of 13,523,274 rupees, were ceded to the British, in commutation of the subsidy, and of every other claim whatever.\n\n**STATEMENT OF THE REVENUE.**\n\n| Districts                      | Revenue       |\n|-------------------------------|---------------|\n| Korah, Currah, and Etawah     | 5,548,577     |\n| Reher, &c.                    | 533,374       |\n| Furruckabad, &c.              | 450,001       |\n| Kharraghur, &c.               | 210,001       |\n| Azimghur, &c.

The nabob agreed to dismiss his supernumerary forces, retaining in his pay only four battalions of Nu-\njebs and Mewatties, 2000 cavalry, and 300 artillery.\n\nHis excellency also engaged that he would establish in his reserved dominions such a system of administration (to be executed by his own officers) as should be conducive to the prosperity of his subjects, and calculated to secure their lives and property; and he further agreed to advise with and act in conformity to the counsel of the British government. On the 22d Feb. 1802, a final arrangement was completed, explanatory of the general principles which should regulate the connexion and intercourse of the two states as resulting from the treaty, and to obviate and anticipate all future doubts. Upon this occasion the nabob declared his intention of promoting Mirza Ahmed Ali Khan, his second son, to the situation of minister for the affairs of government; in which appointment the Marquis Wellesley, then governor-general, concurred.\n\nIt was also stipulated, that until the formation of a commercial treaty mutually beneficial, the navigation of the Ganges, and of all other rivers the boundaries of the two states, should be free and uninterrupted; it still remaining in the power of each government to levy such duties on goods imported as they considered proper, provided they did not exceed those collected by prior usage.\n\nSince this period the Nabob, Saadit Ali, has continued sovereign of Oude, and his dominions have enjoyed the utmost tranquillity. He possesses superior abilities to the generality of his countrymen, and is the only native prince who ever appeared to have a real taste for European conveniences. He has excellent houses of his own building, well furnished, with carriages, horses, equipage, and table well furnished in the English style. (Remel, Malcolm, Treaties, Franklin, Colebrooke, Kyd, &c. &c.)\n\nOude.\u2014A district in the province of Oude, situated between the 26th and 27th degrees of north latitude. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Oude, containing 21 mahals; measurement, 2,796,206 bengahs; revenue, 40,956,343 dauns; seyngahl, 1,680,249 dams. This sircar furnishes 1340 cavalry, 23 elephants, and 31,900 infantry.\"\n\nIn this district jungle is frequent, with mango clumps and villages, but cultivation much more scanty than in the British territory\u2014the difference being such that it immediately strikes the traveller. Small streams often occur, over which in many places there are stone bridges; and the roads here are generally better than in most districts under a native government. The chief towns are Oude, Fyzabad, and Taunah; and the principal rivers the Goggrah and the Goompty.\n\nOude.\u2014A town in the province of Oude, in the nabob's territories, situated on the south side of the Deewah, or Goggrah River, 85 miles travelling distance east from Lucknow. Lat. 26\u00b0 45'. N. Long. 82\u00b0 10'. E. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"Oude is one of the largest cities of Hindostan. In ancient times this city is said to have measured 148 coss in length, and 36 coss in breadth. Upon sifting the earth which is round the city, small grains of gold are sometimes found in it. This town is esteemed one of the most sacred places of antiquity.\"\n\nNearly adjoining to Fyzabad are the remains of the ancient city of Oude; but whatever may have been its former magnificence, it now exhibits nothing but a heap of shapeless ruins. It is still considered as a place of great sanctity, to which the Hindoos perform pilgrimages.\n\nOudghir, (U'dwaghiri).\u2014A populous village, with a fort and cypress garden in the Nizam's dominions, in\nthe province of Bejapoor, 115 miles N.W. from Hyderabad. Lat. 18\u00b0. 19'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 25'. E.\n\n**Ouller Lake.**\u2014A lake in the province of Cashmere, into which the River Belut or Jhyllum empties itself. Lat. 34\u00b0. 22'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 50'. E. Abul Fazel describes it as measuring 28 coss in circumference, having in the centre a palace, built by Sultan Zein ul Abdeen.\n\n**Ound.**\u2014A village in the Maharratta territories, in the province of Bejapoor, situated about nine miles from Poonah. The district attached to Ound, although surrounded on every side by the Peshwa's dominions, is the property of the Sindia family.\n\n**Ouncha. (Uncha, Lofty).**\u2014A town in the province of Allahabad, district of Bundelcund. Lat. 22\u00b0. 23'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 52'. E. In remote times this was a city of great note, the Rajah of Ouncha being then the head of the Bundelah tribes, from whom the other rajahs received the teeka, or token of investiture. In 1790 his revenue was reduced to one lack, and his consequence in proportion. (*Hunter, &c.*)\n\n**Oussoor.**\u2014A town in the Mysore Rajah's territories, 20 miles S.S.E. from Bangaloor. Lat. 129\u00b0. 45'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. E. This place surrendered without resistance in 1791 to a detachment under Major Gowdie, although sufficiently strong for a defence. (*Diron, &c.*)\n\n**Owlah. (Aula, First).**\u2014A town in the Delhi Province, district of Bariely, situated about 16 miles N.W. from the town of Bariely. The River Nawaub Nullah runs along the south-western side of Owlah, which is now in ruins. On the summit of an eminence is a brick fort, erected about 70 years ago by Ali Mahomed, the founder of the Robillah government, who kept his court here. In the environs, which, during the nabob's government, were waste for want of cultivation, are to be found the ruins of palaces, mosques, and gardens. (*Franklin, &c.*)\n\n---\n\n**P.**\n\n**Pachete. (Pacher).**\u2014A zemindary in the province of Bengal, which is now incorporated in the surrounding districts of Ramgur, Birbhum, and Burdwan. In 1784 Pachete, Chuta Nagpoor, Palamow, and Rangur, contained, according to Major Rennel's mensuration, 21,732 square miles, of which 16,732 were nearly waste. The revenue was only 161,216 rupees.\n\nPachete is a large and westerly zemindary, bounded by Chuta Nagpoor and Rangur, containing a jungly territory of about 2779 square miles, which was once a frontier territory towards the western confines of Bengal, and still retains the sterility and barbarism of the neighbouring uncouth and mountainous regions to the south. The climate is very unhealthy, which has been experienced by the troops stationed at Jaulda. The principal towns are Pachete, Rogonauthunge, and Jauldah, which, with the zemindary, were formerly held by a Rajpoot family, named Narraiu. (*J. Grant, Colebrooke, &c.*)\n\n**Pachete.**\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, the capital of a zemindary of the same name, 126 miles N.W. from Calcutta. Lat. 23\u00b0. 36'. N. Long. 86\u00b0. 50'. E.\n\n**Packanga.**\u2014A town on the east coast of the Malay Peninsula, situated on a river of the same name. Lat. 3\u00b0. 32'. N. This was formerly a place of some note, but has long since fallen to decay, owing to its being dependent on Rhio, where most of the eastern trade was carried, until it fell a sacrifice to the revenge of the Dutch. The town of Packanga is very conveniently situated for trade, having a deep fresh water river, capable of admitting at the mouth vessels of 100 tons burthen. The produce of this place is gold dust, tin, and rattans. (*Elmore, &c., &c.*)\n\n**Padah. (Padma).**\u2014A town possessed by independent zemindars, in\nthe province of Gundwana, district of Gangpoor, situated on the east side of the Soank River, 25 miles from the south frontier of Chuta Naspoor. Lat. 22\u00b0 N. Long. 81\u00b0 45'. E.\n\nPadang.\u2014A Dutch settlement on the west coast of Sumatra, to which the factories at Pulo Chino, Primaan, and Adjerhadja, were subordinate. Lat. 6\u00b0 45'. S. Long. 99\u00b0 55'. E.\n\nThe town of Padang lies one mile within the river. The land to the northward is low towards the sea, but mountainous up the country. Some pepper, camphor, and benzoin, are furnished; but ever since the establishment of the English settlement at Bencoolen the quantity collected has been small. A considerable quantity of gold is collected here, and sent to Batavia. Near to Padang is a vein of gold, which formerly was worked; but not finding the returns adequate to the expense, the Dutch East India Company let it to farm, and it now produces little or nothing. Padang was first visited by the English East India Company's ships in 1649, at which time it was not occupied by the Dutch. Marsden, Elmore, Bruce, &c.)\n\nPadoonah.\u2014A town belonging to the Nagpoor Rajah, in the province of Gundwana, 78 miles N.W. from the city of Nagpoor. Lat. 21\u00b0 53'. N. Long. 78\u00b0 52'. E.\n\nPagahm.\u2014A town in the Birman empire, situated on the east side of the Irawaddy River. Lat. 21\u00b0 9'. N. Long. 94\u00b0 35'. E. In remote times this city was the residence of a long dynasty of kings, and is still famous for its numerous temples, to count which is among the proverbial impossibilities of the Birmaans. Searcely anything now remains of ancient Pagahm, except its numerous mouldering temples, and the vestiges of an old brick fort, the ramparts of which are still to be traced. In the bazar the stalls are well provided with rice, pulse, greens, garlic, onions, and fruit; besides fresh fish, gnapee (putrid sprats), and dead lizards, which latter the Birmaans account a great delicacy when well cooked; but the markets contain no butcher's meat.\n\nThis place is said to have been the residence of 45 successive monarchs, and abandoned 500 years ago, in consequence of a divine admonition. Its remains prove it to have been a place of no ordinary splendour. Many of the most ancient temples at this place are not solid at the bottom. A well-arched dome supports a ponderous superstructure, within which an image of Gaudma sits enshrined. His general posture is sitting on a pedestal, adorned with representations of the sacred leaf of the lotus\u2014the left hand resting on the lap, and the right pendant. (Symes, &c.)\n\nPainomjeung.\u2014A castle in Tibet, loftily situated on a perpendicular rock, washed by a river which flows at its foot. Lat. 29\u00b0 N. Long. 89\u00b0 10'. E. Below the castle is a bridge of rough stones, upon nine piers of very rude structure. The Tibetans invariably place their strong buildings upon rocks, and most of the monasteries have similar foundations. (Turner, &c.)\n\nPaitan.\u2014A district on the N.E. coast of Boroco, containing a bay and river of the same name. It is remarkable for the abundance of camphor; and also yields clove, bark, and plenty of lissang. The bay is very full of shoals, and the coast on both sides extremely foul. There is a creek leading from Paitan into a large bay, between it and Malloodoo Bay, of which are many islands much incumbered with shoals. The islands and shoals in this part of the Eastern Seas are beyond number. (Dalrymple, &c.)\n\nPalachy, (Palasi).\u2014A town in the province of South Coimbetoor, containing about 300 houses and a small temple, with a small fort adjacent, 121 miles S.by E. from Serlingapatam. Lat. 11\u00b0 47'. N. Long. 77\u00b0 8'. E. From hence the streams\nrun east and west to the Coromandel and Malabar coasts.\n\nIn this vicinity, in the year 1800, a pot was dug up containing a great many Roman coins of Augustus and Tiberius. They were of two kinds, but all of the same value, each weighing 56 grains.\n\n**Palamcotta**, (Pallincatta).\u2014A town in the Carnatic, 125 miles S.S.W. from Madras, and 42 miles S. S. W. from Pondicherry. Lat. 11\u00b0. 26'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 42'. E.\n\n**Palamcotta**.\u2014A town in the province of Tinnevelly, 55 miles E.N.E. from Cape Comorin. Lat. 8\u00b0. 42'. Long. 77\u00b0. 50'. E.\n\n**Palamow**.\u2014A hilly and jungly district in the province of Bahar, situated between the 23rd and 25th degrees of north latitude. On the north it is bounded by Rhotas; on the south and west by different wild districts in the province of Gundwana; and on the east by Ramgur. This is one of the least cultivated and most thinly inhabited territories in the Company's dominions, a great proportion of the land consisting of hills covered with jungle. The soil in many parts is strongly impregnated with iron. The principal towns are Palamow and Jaynagur; there are no rivers of any considerable size, but many small streams.\n\n**Palamow**.\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, 135 miles S. W. from Patna, and the capital of a district of the same name. Lat. 23\u00b0. 52'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 10'. E.\n\n**Palapetty**, (Phallapati).\u2014A town in the district of Dindigul, 30 miles north from the town of Dindigul. Lat. 10\u00b0. 40'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 10'. E.\n\n**Palar River**.\u2014This river has its source in the Mysore Province, among the hills of Nundydroog, not far from that of the Penumar; the first flowing to the south, and the last to the north. The Padar, after a winding course of about 220 miles through the Mysore and Carnatic, falls into the sea near Sadras.\n\n**Palawan Isle**.\u2014A large island in the Eastern Seas, extending between the northern extremity of Borneo, with which and the Philippines it forms an extensive chain of islands. Its extreme length may be estimated at 275 miles, and the average breadth about 32 miles.\n\nThe country is described as being plain and flat to the bottom of the hills. The productions are cowries, wax, tortoise-shell, and sea slug, or biche de mer, the last being abundant. There is much ebony and laka wood; and it is said there are hot springs and mines of gold. The west side is chiefly inhabited by a savage people, who seldom frequent the coast. The greater part of this island was formerly under the dominion of the Sooloos, but is little known to Europeans. (Dalrymple, &c., &c.)\n\n**Palcote**, (Palacata).\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, district of Chuta Nagpoor, 220 miles W. by N. from Calcutta. Lat. 22\u00b0. 58'. N. Long. 85\u00b0. E.\n\n**Palee**, (Pali).\u2014A town in the Nabob of Oude's territories, 20 miles N. E. from Furruckabad. Lat. 27\u00b0. 32'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 49'. E.\n\n**Palembang**.\u2014A district on the north-eastern coast of Sumatra, extending along a river of the same name, which rises within two days' journey of Bengoolen, and runs nearly across the island. Opposite to the town of Palembang and the Dutch factory it is upwards of a mile in breadth, and is conveniently navigated by vessels, whose depth of water does not exceed 14 feet.\n\nThe port is much frequented by trading vessels, chiefly from Java, Bally, Madura, and Celebes, which bring rice, salt, and cloths, the manufacture of those islands. With opium, the piece goods of India, and European commodities, it is supplied by the Dutch from Batavia, and by interlopers. These in return receive pepper and tin, which formerly were monopolized by the Dutch East India Company. The quantity of pepper thus furnished was from one to two millions of\npounds per annum, and of tin about two millions; one-third of which was shipped at Batavia for Holland, and the remainder sent to China. This tin is the produce of the Island of Banea, situated at the mouth of the river, which may be considered as an entire hill of tin sand.\n\nThe lower parts of the Palembang country are flat marshy lands, generally understood to have been formerly covered by the sea. The pepper is cultivated in the interior, which the king's agents purchase at a cheap rate\u2014the trade in these parts being usually monopolized by the sovereign. In return he supplies the country people with opium, salt, and piece goods. The dominions of this prince formerly reached as far as the hills of Lampong to the southward. The interior parts are divided into districts, each of which is assigned as a seif or government to one of the royal family or nobles. The present rulers and great part of the inhabitants came from Java, but Palembang is supposed, by the best authorities, to have been the original country of the Malay race. The domestic attendants on the prince are, for the most part, females.\n\nThe policy of the Palembang sultans, who were themselves strangers, having always been to encourage foreign settlers, the city and lower parts of the river are, in a great measure, peopled with natives of China, Cochin China, Cambodia, Siam, Patani, Java, Celebes, and other eastern places. The Mahommedan religion prevails throughout all the dominions of Palembang, with the exception of a district near the sea-coast, where the natives live like wild animals. The language of the king and his court is the high dialect of Javan, mixed with some foreign idioms; that of general intercourse is the Malay.\n\nIn 1812 the town and district of Palembang were taken possession of by the British forces. (Marsden, ye.)\n\nPalembang.\u2014A town in the Island of Sumatra, the capital of a province of the same name. Lat. 2\u00b0. 48'. S. Long. 104\u00b0. 50'. E.\n\nThis town is situated on a flat marshy tract, a few miles above the Delta of the river, about 60 miles from the sea, and yet so far from the mountains of the interior, that they are not visible. It extends about eight miles along both banks. The buildings, with the exception of the king's palace and mosque, are all of wood or bamboos, standing on posts, and mostly covered with palmry leaves. There are also a number of floating habitations, mostly shops, upon bamboo rafts moored to piles, which are moved with the tide when required. The adjacent country being overflowed during high tides, almost all the communication is carried on with boats.\n\nThe king's palace being surrounded with a high wall, nothing is known to Europeans of its interior. Adjoining, on the lower side, is a strong, square-roofed battery commanding the river. The royal mosque stands behind the palace; and, from the style of architecture, appears to have been constructed by an European. (Marsden, ye.)\n\nPalemerdy.\u2014A town in the Southern Carnatic, district of Madura, 31 miles S. E. from the town of Madura. Lat. 9\u00b0. 26'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 23'. E.\n\nPalungwe.\u2014A town (formerly fortified) in the province of Bahar, district of Moughir, 122 miles S. E. from Patna. Lat. 24\u00b0. 5'. N. Long. 86\u00b0. 15'. E.\n\nPalicaudcherry, (Palighaut).\u2014A town in the province of Malabar, 110 miles south from Seriapatam. Lat. 10\u00b0. 50'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 50'. E.\n\nThe fort was built by Hyder on his conquest of Malabar, in the country called Paligatsherry, which then belonged to the Shekury Rajah, one of the petty Malabar chiefs. Around the fort are scattered many desas (estates), villages, and bazars, all together containing a considerable population; but there is very little appearance of a town. This\nsmall district, in the year 1800, contained the following number of houses:\n\nOccupied by the families of rajahs - - - - - - - - 42\nBy Christians - - - - - - - - 13\nBy Mahommedans - - - - - - 1,469\nBy Namburies (Brahmins of high caste) - - - - - - 137\nBy Puttar Brahmins - - - - - - 3,309\nBy Nairs - - - - - - - - 4,292\nBy artificers and tradesmen - - - - - - 2,329\nBy Shanars or Tiars (cultivators) - - - - - - 4,287\nBy fishermen - - - - - - - - 539\nBy people of Karnata, or Chera - - - - - - - - 5,054\n\nTotal houses 21,473\n\nContaining free inhabitants 106,500\nAdd Chumar, or slaves - - - - - - 16,574\n\nTotal population 123,074\n\nexclusive of military, camp followers, travellers, vagrants, &c.\n\nThe part of this district occupied by thick forests, and uninhabited, is very extensive. These forests possess a great advantage in being intersected by several branches of the Paniani River; by which, in the rainy season, the timber may be floated to the sea. About 45,000 cubical feet of teak may be procured annually, but it can only be done with the assistance of a large body of trained elephants.\n\nThe Palighaut district was ceded to the British by Tippoo, at the peace of 1792, when its revenues were valued at 88,000 pagodas. (F. Buchanan, \u00a7c.)\n\nPalkah, (Palica).\u2014A small town in the Seik territories, in the province of Lahore, 112 miles N. E. from the city of Lahore. Lat. 32\u00b0. 58'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 13'. E.\n\nPalenga.\u2014A village in the province of Sinde, situated on the route from Hyderabad to Luckput Bunder. Lat. 24\u00b0. 19'. N.\n\nClose to this village are two pools of water, but the adjacent country is an extensive plain, little cultivated, and affording indifferent pasturage for cattle.\n\nPalhaunpoor.\u2014A town in the province of Gujrat, district of Dandar. Lat. 24\u00b0. 44'. N. Long. 72\u00b0. 35'. E. Through this place is one of the roads from Cutch and Gujrat to Upper Hindostan.\n\nPalks Straits.\u2014An arm of the sea, which separates Ceylon from the Coast of Coromandel, and so named after a Dutchman, who first attempted the passage.\n\nPalla Isle.\u2014A small island in the Eastern Seas, about six miles in circumference, situated to the south of Sangir. Lat. 3\u00b0. 5'. N. Long. 125\u00b0. 30'. E. It is inhabited and cultivated.\n\nPalleangan Islf.\u2014A small, low, woody island, one of the Sooloo Archipelago, having a salt water lake in the centre.\n\nPalnaud, (Palanatha).\u2014A district in the Carnatic, situated principally between the 16th and 17th degrees of north latitude. This district belongs to the Carnatic, although placed towards the Krishna River to the west of Guntoor, in the Northern Circars. The chief towns are Macherla, Timerycotta, and Currumconda. This district was finally acquired from the Nabob of the Carnatic in 1801, and is now comprehended in the collectorship of Guntoor. It has not yet been permanently assessed for the revenue.\n\nPalpah.\u2014A small district in Northern Hindostan subject to the Ghookhali Rajah of Nepaul, and situated between the 28th and 29th degrees of north latitude. To the south it is separated from the province of Oude by extensive woods and forests, placed at the bottom of the irregular mass of hills, which compose the surface of this and all the adjacent country. The chief town is Paipah, and the Gunduck is the principal river. The district forms one of the petty principalities, which altogether form the country\nof the 24 Rajahs. (Kirkpatrick, \u00a7c. \u00a7c.)\n\nPalpah.\u2014A town in Northern Hindostan, subject to the Nepaul Rajah, and the capital of Mahadut Sein. Lat. 28\u00b0. 11'. N. Long. 82\u00b0. 55'. E. This place is situated among the mountains, the Gunduck River passing below. (Kirkpatrick, \u00a7c.)\n\nPalree.\u2014A village in the province of Gujrat, near the western boundary, and situated between Therah and Theraud.\n\nThe country from hence to Rhunteela is a continued succession of hill and dale, covered with thick jungle, and wholly uncultivated. The jungle consist of the baubool, bone, a green bush resembling the briar, and long grass, which grows up to the branches of the trees. The little hills are formed entirely of sand, and very loose. Palree belongs to the Rajah of Deodhur, and at present contains about 250 huts, principally inhabited by Rajpoots.\n\nPamper.\u2014A town in the province of Cashmere, district of Vehy, situated on the north side of the Jhylam River. Lat. 34\u00b0. 19'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 13'. E.\n\nPanagur.\u2014An extensive village in the province of Malwah, district of Gurrah, 115 miles south from Chatterpoor. Lat. 23\u00b0. 20'. N. Long. 80\u00b0. 15'. E.\n\nPanamao Isle.\u2014One of the Philippines, about 45 miles in circumference, and situated between the 11th and 12th degrees of north latitude.\n\nPanarooocan.\u2014A town in the north-eastern extremity of the island of Java, formerly the capital of an ancient principality, but now subject to the Dutch. Lat. 7\u00b0. 40'. S. Long. 114\u00b0. E.\n\nThe fort here is a square, built with pallisades and planks, decayed with age, mounting four two-pounders, and surrounded by a wide ditch full of water, and situated in a marshy plain, three quarters of a mile from the sea-coast. It is usually garrisoned by invalids, who live well on their pay here; fish, poultry, and rice being cheap and abundant.\n\nThe town is placed in the Straits of Madura, on a river, which empties itself by several branches into the sea, none of which are navigable, even for canoes, except during high floods. From the fort here, when the weather is clear, Samanap, in the Island of Madura, may be discerned. The Chief of Panarooocan is a Chinese, who lives in a large wooden house, and entertains in the European style. (Tombe, \u00a7c.)\n\nPanchberarah.\u2014A town and small district in the province of Cashmere. Lat. 34\u00b0. 32'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. E. It is described by Abul Fazel as a place of great sanctity, and dependant on Uneej, and that it had formerly been a large city.\n\nPandiwar.\u2014A small village in the province of Gujrat, district of Werrear, belonging, in equal shares, to the Jhingwara state and the Nabob of Sommec. Near it flows the Roopini, which is a small stream of clear but salt water. The surrounding country is flat, open, and, when well cultivated, productive.\n\nPandar.\u2014A small town in the Seik territories, in the province of Lahore, 132 miles N. E. from the city of Lahore. Lat. 33\u00b0. 17'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 16'. N.\n\nPangansane Isle.\u2014An island in the Eastern Seas, situated off the south-eastern extremity of Celebes, about the 5th degree of south latitude. In length it may be estimated at 52 miles, by 16 miles the average breadth. Part of this island is very low, level, and, covered with fine trees; and it is also, in general, well peopled.\n\nPangoottarran.\u2014A small island in the Eastern Seas, one of the Soo-loo Archipelago, about 10 miles long, by four the average breadth. Lat. 6\u00b0. 9'. N. Long. 126\u00b0. 30'. E.\n\nThis island is an entire bed of coral rock, with scarce any appearance of soil on it; yet it abounds with cocoa nut trees, which are tall and fruitful, and of great use to the in-\nhabitants, as the island is destitute of good fresh water. Notwithstanding the deficiency of good water, and scarcity of soil, this island has plenty of cattle, goats, and fowls, and is tolerably well inhabited. It was formerly settled by the Spaniards, who left a large breed of hogs here. Some of the chief persons' houses are built on four trees, lopped off for posts; and perhaps something of this kind may have given rise to the reports of people living on trees, as the trunks continue to vegetate, and send forth branches. (Dalrymple, &c.)\n\nPanha.\u2014A village, tributary to the Nepaul rajahs, in the province of Serinagur, containing 40 or 50 huts, situated about 100 feet above the base of a mountain. Lat. 30\u00b0. 18'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 16'. E.\n\nSix miles to the south of this place are the lead and copper mines of Dhanpoor, which are farmed for 4000 rupees per annum. From two to 300 people are employed the whole year in smelting the ore, the process of which is very simple. It is performed by pounding the ore, and making it up with cow dung into balls, which are put into a furnace sufficiently heated to produce a fusion of the metal. About eight miles to the north, on the opposite hills, are the copper mines of Nagpoor, which are the richest in the Serinagur province, but which are not worked on account of the capital they would require, and the unsettled state of the Ghookhali government of Nepaul. (Raper, &c.)\n\nPanga Point.\u2014A remarkable point in the Island of Java, situated at the north-eastern extremity, at the mouth of the western entrance of the Straits of Madura.\n\nAt this place Java and European pilots are stationed, who, as soon as vessels are discovered standing for the channel, go before to pilot them to Gressece and Somaghaya. Refreshments of every kind may, at the same time, be procured from the masters and crews of the pilot boats, and at moderate prices. The Dutch maintain here a small military guard for the protection of their flag. (Tembe, &c.)\n\nPaniyany.\u2014A sea-port town in the province of Malabar, 40 miles S. by E. from Calicut. Lat. 10\u00b0. 44'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. E. This place is called by the natives Punang Waenl, and contains above 500 houses, belonging to traders, 40 mosques, and at least 1000 huts, inhabited by the lower orders of the people. It is very irregularly built, but many of the houses are two stories high, built of stone, and thatched with cocoanut leaves. The huts are inhabited by boatmen and fishermen, who were formerly Muenas, a low caste of Hindoos, but they have now all embraced the faith of Mahommed.\n\nThe town is scattered over a sandy plain, on the south side of a river, which descends from Anima-laya, and enters the sea by a very wide channel. The mouth, however, is shut by a bar, which only admits boats to enter. The trading-boats are called pattemars, and on an average carry 50,000 cocoa nuts, or 1000 muddies of rice, equal to 500 Bengal bags. About 60 years ago the Moplays of this port were very rich, and possessed vessels that sailed to Surat, Mocha, Madras, and Bengal; but the oppressions of Tippoo Sultan reduced them to great poverty. The exports from hence are teak wood, cocoa nuts, iron, and rice; the chief imports wheat, pulses, sugar, jaggery, salt, cut (terra japonica), and spices.\n\nPaniyany is the residence of the tangul, or chief priest, of the Moplay, who says he is descended from Ali and Fatime, the daughter of Mahommed. Although of the Mahommedan religion, the tangul's sister's son, according to the custom of Malabar, is considered as the heir to this hereditary dignity. These people are called Moplayar in Malabar, and Lubbaymar at Madras; but, among themselves, they acknowledge no other name than that of Mussulmauns, or Mahommed-\nans. Being of Arabic extraction, they consider themselves of more honourable birth than the Tartar Mahommedans, who are of the contrary opinion. The Arabians settled in India soon after the promulgation of the faith of Mahommed, and have made very numerous converts; yet, in many families of distinction, the Arab blood seems still uncontaminated.\n\nThe Moplays use a written character peculiar to themselves, and totally different from the present Arabic, which language is known to very few of them except their priests. The Moplays of Malabar are both traders and farmers; the Lubbaymurs of Madras confine themselves to the former profession. As traders, they are a remarkably quiet, industrious people; but some of them in the interior, having been encouraged by Tippoo in a most licentious attack on the lives, persons, and property of the Hindoos, became a set of fierce, bloodthirsty, bigotted ruffians; which disposition the British government had considerable difficulty in reforming. Prior to this the Moplays had no authority except in the small district of Cananore, even over their own sect, but were entirely subject to the Hindu chiefs, in whose dominions they resided. Tippoo's code of laws was never known beyond the limits of Calicut. During this period of total anarchy the number of Moplays was greatly increased; multitudes of Hindoos were circumcised by force, and many of the lower orders converted.\n\nIn religious matters the taugul is the head of the sect, and the office is hereditary in the female branch. The mosques are very numerous, in each of which presides an imam, or mollah, appointed by the taugul, who usually bestows the office on his sister's son, the heir of the person who last held the office. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nPANNIPUT, (Panipati).\u2014A town in the province of Delhi, 50 miles N. by W. from the city of Delhi. Lat. 29\u00b0 23'. N. Long. 76\u00b0 50'. E. In its greatest extent this place is about four miles in circumference, and was formerly surrounded by a brick wall, which partly remains. In the centre is the shrine of a Mahommedan devotee, named Shah Shereef and Deen Abu Ali Cullinder, whose death happened in the 724th year of the Hijerah. The imports to this place are salt, grain, and cotton cloth; the surrounding country produces and exports coarse sugar.\n\nPanniput is famous for having been the scene where two of the greatest battles ever fought in India took place, both decisive of the sway of Hindostan. The first was in the year A.D. 1525, between the army of Sultan Baber and that of the Delhi Patan Emperor Ibrahim Lodi, in which the latter was slain, and his army totally discomfited. With him the Patan dynasty of Lodi terminated, and the Mogul one of Timour commenced.\n\nThe second took place in 1761, between the combined Mahommedan army, commanded by Ahmed Shah Abdallhi, the sovereign of Kabul, and that of the Maharattas, commanded by the Bhow Sedasiva. The Mahommedan army consisted altogether of 42,000 horse and 38,000 foot, besides camels, and between 70 and 80 pieces of cannon. These were the regular troops; but the irregulars, who accompanied them, were sometimes more numerous. The Doorranies of Kabul, who were the strength of the army, being about 29,000, were all men of great bodily vigour, and their horses of the Turkish breed, and very hardy.\n\nThe regulars of the Maharatta army consisted of 55,000 horse and 15,000 foot, with 200 pieces of cannon, and camel pieces and rockets without number. Besides the regular troops, there were 15,000 pindaries (plunderers), and the camp followers may be estimated at four times the number of the regulars.\n\nThe armies continued in front of\neach other from the 26th of October, 1760, to the 7th of January, 1761, during which interval of time many bloody skirmishes took place, which generally terminated in favour of the Durraniies. At the last-mentioned period, the Maharatta army being reduced to the greatest distress for the want of supplies, the Bhow determined to quit his intrenchments, and give battle. The action continued nearly equal from morning until noon, about which time Biswass Row, the Peshwa's son, a youth of 17, was mortally wounded, which appears to have decided the fate of the battle, as the Maharattas then fled in all directions, pursued by the victors, who gave no quarter in the heat of the pursuit.\n\nOf all descriptions, men, women, and children, there were said to have been 500,000 in the Maharatta camp, of whom the greatest part were killed or taken prisoners; and of those who escaped from the field of battle, many were destroyed by the zemindars. About 40,000 prisoners were taken alive; those who fell into the hands of the Durraniies, were mostly murdered afterwards by them, alledging, in jest, as an excuse, that when they left their own country, their mothers, sisters, and wives desired, that, when they defeated the unbelievers, they would kill a few of them on their account, that they also might possess a merit in the sight of the prophet.\n\nThe commander in chief of the Maharattas, Sedasiya Bhow, was probably killed in the battle, but this was never to a certainty established. Many years afterwards, about 1779, a person appeared at Benares, who said he was the Bhow, and some of the Maharattas acknowledged his claim, while others treated him as an impostor, which he probably was. (Asiatic Researches, Ferishta, G. Thomas, &c.)\n\nPannah, (or Purna).\u2014A town in the province of Allahabad, 30 miles S. E. from Chatterpoor. Lat. 24\u00b0. 43', N. Long. 80\u00b0. 17', E.\n\nThis place is situated above the Ghauts, or beyond that range of mountains extending from Rhotas to the confines of Ajmeer, on which stands Callinjer, from whence Pannah is distant 20 miles.\n\nIn the neighbourhood are the valuable and celebrated diamond mines, supposed to have been the Panassa of Ptolomy. During the reign of Acher they were estimated at eight lacks of rupees annually, and they also formed a considerable source of public revenue, as well as of mercantile profit, during the government of the native chiefs of Bandelcund, and of Ali Bahadur, its last Maharatta conqueror. During the reign of Rajah Chuttersal (about 1750), the duties levied at Pannah, and the profits accruing to government from these diamond mines, were estimated at four lacks of rupees per annum; but we have no detailed description of them of recent date. As they are now comprehended within the British territories, it is to be hoped this want will not be long unsupplied. (MSS. &c. &c.)\n\nPanter Isle.\u2014An island in the Eastern Seas, separated from that of Loblem by the Straits of Aloo, and situated between the eighth and ninth degrees of north latitude. In length it may be estimated at 30 miles, by 12 the average breadth.\n\nPantura.\u2014A small village, with a church, in the Island of Ceylon, situated about 18 miles to the south of Columbo. Lat. 6\u00b0. 50'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 53'. E.\n\nPanwell.\u2014A town in the province of Aurungabad, 27 miles E. from Bombay. Lat. 19\u00b0. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 13'. E.\n\nThe River Pan flows up to it seven miles from the harbour; but, during the prevalence of the south-westerly winds, the passage to Bombay is tedious and uncertain. The ruins of a small fort still remains at the entrance, built in 1682 by the Maharatta Rajah Sambhajee, to protect the low districts in the neighbour-\nhood from the irruptions of the Sid-\nlies, then in the service of Aurug-\nzebe, who used to land, and burn or\ncarry off the rice. The town of Pan-\nwell is extensive; and, being well\nsituated, carries on a considerable\ntrade. (M. Graham, Moor, Lord\nValentia, &c.)\n\nPany Isle.\u2014One of the Philip-\npines, situated due south of Luzon,\nbetween the 122d and 123d degrees\nof east longitude. In length it may\nbe estimated at 110 miles, by 38\nmiles the average breadth.\n\nThis island, when viewed from\nthe sea, exhibits numerous villages\non the declivity of the hills, the\nhouses of which are well built, and\narranged with great regularity. The\nsea-coast abounds with cocoa nut\ntrees, and in the interior are plenty\nof wild game, such as deer, hogs,\nand buffaloes. Cattle and horses\nare said to be so plenty, as not to be\nappropriated, but allowed to range\nat pleasure. The air of the island\nis unhealthy, on account of the mo-\nrasses and the thinness of the cul-\ntivation. Like most unexplored\ncountries, it has the reputation\nof containing mines of silver and\ngold.\n\nThe principal establishments of\nthe Spaniards on this island are at\nIlo-ilo and Antigua, on which coast\nthere is good anchorage. Antigua\nis situated in 10\u00b0. 42'. N. where the\nanchorage is in 10 fathoms, at a\nconsiderable distance from the shore.\nVessels cannot anchor here in No-\nvember, December, and January,\nwithout considerable risk, for it is\nthen the winds from the S. W. and\nW. prevail. Water is to be had\nhere from a rivulet, and also from a\nriver, which serves as a ditch to the\nfort, up which boats may proceed a\nconsiderable way, but the water is\nbrackish even during neap tides.\nAntigua, like the other Spanish set-\ntlements, is extremely ill governed\nand defended\u2014vessels being plun-\ndered in the harbour by the pirates,\nwho carry off the crews into slavery.\nThe fort is built of wood, and gar-\nrisoned by about 20 Christians of\nthe country.\n\nThe inhabitants of this island are\nmore industrious than those of Lu-\nzon, and manufacture, from cotton\nand from the fibres of another plant,\nhandkerchiefs and cloths, which they\nwear, and export to the neighbour-\ning islands. A coloured cloth, made\nhere from a plant raised on the\nisland, is much worn by females at\nManilla. (Somerset, Meares, &c.)\n\nPappal.\u2014A district on the north-\neastern coast of Borneo, the limits\nof which are Sanpaumangio on the\nnorth, and Keemanees River, in Lat.\n5\u00b0. 30'. N. The productions of this\ncoast in general are sago, rice, betel\nnut, cocoa nut oil, camphor, wax,\nsome pepper, and coarse cinnamon.\nThe country is populous, the inter-\nior particularly, which is inhabited\nby idaan, or aborigines, as are also\nsome places on the sea-coast.\n\nThis part of Borneo is very well\nwatered, and has the convenience\nof many rivers navigable by boats,\nand some even by large vessels.\nThe river of Tawarran leads to the\nlake of Keeney Balloo, from whence\nit is about 10 or 15 miles distant,\nand is accessible for boats. Tam-\npassook, Abai, Loobook, and Am-\nboony are small rivers in this district,\nthe borders of which are inhabited\nby Mahomedans. The harbours\nand rivers of Abai are superior to\nany between Sanpaumangio and\nPortgay, and it is the only place\nwhere vessels can have shelter from\nwesterly winds. The country here\nabounds with grain, and, if culti-\nvated, might be made to produce\nconsiderable quantities of pepper\nand cinnamon.\n\nThe River Tawarran is inhabited\nchiefly by idaan, among whom a\nfew Chinese are settled. Manca-\nboony River is inhabited by Ma-\nhomedans, and is well settled; to\nthe eastward lie Port Gaya and\nsome other islands, which, with the\nshoals, form a harbour for small ves-\nsels. The banks of the Batuan,\nInanmanu, Mauatala, Poolatau, and\nKinaroot rivers, are inhabited by Mahommedans, and produce sago, rice, betel nut, cinnamon, and cocoa nut oil.\n\nThe next river to the southward is Pangalat, which is also peopled by Mahommedans, and produces camphor, besides other articles. Keemances is the last river of what formerly was the Sooloo dominions. The inhabitants are idaan, and carry on an extensive trade in their own prows to Java, &c. The country, besides a considerable quantity of coarse cinnamon, and other articles, produces tenjoo, which is the gum of a certain tree found also in Palawan and Magindanao. (Dalrymple, &c. &c.)\n\nPAPUA, (Tannah Papua, Papua Land).\n\nThe Papuan Isles extend from the south end of Gilolo, and the north coast of Ceram, to the west end of Papua, or New Guinea; the exact dimensions of which have not yet been ascertained; nor is it certain that it is not a cluster of large islands, instead of one of immense size. If the latter, its longitudinal extent is so great, that it appears to appertain partly to the Asiatic Isles, and partly to those of the Pacific; the inhabitants of the two extremities exhibiting considerable generic differences. The western is possessed by the remarkable race of oriental negroes, while the natives of the eastern approximate to the yellow-complexioned, long-haired natives of the South Sea Islands.\n\nLike Celebes, Gilolo, and other eastern isles, Papua is indented by such deep bays, that it resembles a chain of peninsulas, so near does the sea approach on each side, and it is only separated from New Holland by a narrow strait, discovered by Captain Flinders in the Investigator. Viewed from the sea, the coast of Papua rises gradually from the shore to hills of considerable elevation; but there are no mountains seen of remarkably great height, such as Mount Ophir in Sumatra. The whole being covered with palm-trees, and timber of large size, the soil may be presumed naturally fertile; but it has as yet been little disturbed by cultivation. The cocoa-nut and two species of the bread-fruit-tree are found here, and also pine-apples and plantains. The horaforas of the interior practise gardening, and some sort of agriculture, as they supply the trading Papuas on the coast with food in exchange for axes, knives, and other kinds of coarse cutlery. Nutmeg-trees grow here in a wild state; but they are known not to be of the proper quality as a spice. It is said, there are no quadrupeds on Papua, except dogs, wild cats, and hogs; and that to the east of Gilolo no horned animals, of any description, are to be found. The woods abound with wild hogs, which the natives kill with spears, and bows and arrows. With the latter they are particularly dexterous, and discharge arrows six feet long with bows made of bamboo, having a string of split rattan.\n\nOn the north-west coast of this island, the natives build their houses on posts, fixed several yards below low-water mark, from which there is a long stage to the land, and also another towards the sea, on which they haul up their canoes. This strange semi-aquatic mode of dwelling is intended to provide against attacks both by sea and land; if the assault be from the first, they take to the woods, and if from the last, they launch their canoes, and sail away. The furniture of these cabins consists of a mat or two, a fire-place, a china plate or basin, with some sago flower. The females make earthen pots from clay, which they burn with dry grass or light brushwood.\n\nThe Papuas on this part of the coast are so far advanced in civilization, as perfectly to understand the nature of traffic, which they carry on with the Malays and Chinese:\nbut more particularly the latter, from whom they purchase their iron tools, blue and red baftas, axes, knives, china beads, plates, and basins. In exchange the Chinese carry back missoy bark, slaves, ambergrise, sea slug (biche de mar), tortoise-shell, small pearls, black and red loories, birds of paradise, and many other species of dead birds, which the Papuas have a particular method of dressing. The Dutch government at Ternate do not allow the Dutch burghers to trade to the coast of New Guinea for missoy bark, the powder of which is much used by the Javanese for rubbing their bodies, the discreet Chinese only being allowed to prosecute this species of commerce.\n\nOn the north-west of Papua, which is the only quarter we are much acquainted with, the natives wear their hair bushed out round their heads to the circumference of two and a half and three feet; and, to make it more extensive, comb it out horizontally from their heads, occasionally adorning it with feathers. From the short, close, woolly nature of an African negro's hair, it could not be dressed exactly in the same manner, as no skill could make it stick out so far from their heads. The men wear a thin stuff made from the fibres of the cocoa nut tree, tied round their middle and between their legs, fixing it up behind. The females in general wear blue Surat cloths, put on in the same manner as the men; the children, until the age of puberty, go entirely naked. Both sexes are fond of glass or china beads, which they wear round the wrist. Captain Forrest says, he saw no gold ornaments among the Papuas, but that they declared it was to be found in the hills. As among all barbarous tribes the women appear to be the laborious class. They make a sort of earthen ware of clay, and mats of the cocoa nut tree.\n\nSome of the horaforas of the interior are said to have long hair; but this appears doubtful, at least so far as applies to the western extremity, where all the inhabitants yet seen by voyagers presented the expanded mop head of the oriental negro. The inhabitants of the more easterly parts have the character of being very savage, and extremely prone to war and carnage. It is said, however, that they deal honestly with the Chinese who trade with them, and advance them goods for several months before the returns are made.\n\nThe Papuas term themselves Igot\u00e9, but by the Spaniards of the Philippines they are named Negritos del Monte, from their colour and bushy hair. They appear to be a second race of aborigines in the eastern isles, in several of which they are still to be found, and in all of which they seem originally to have existed. In the more western of the Papuan Isles, some of their divisions have formed small savage states, and made some advances towards civilization; but the greater part of them, even with the example of more civilized races before their eyes, have betrayed no symptoms either of a taste or capacity for improvement, and continue in their primitive state of nakedness, sleeping on trees, devoid of houses or clothing, subsisting on the spontaneous products of the forest, or the precarious success of their fishing and hunting excursions. The natives of the Andaman Isles seem to be of this race, as also the black mountainer tribes of the Malay peninsula; but a considerable difference may be discovered in the bodily frames of these miserable wretches, and the structure of the natives of the Papuan Isles. The former are a dwarfish, diminutive race, while the latter are of a good stature and robust, although much inferior to the African negro in muscular powers. The skin of both is jet black, but coarse and rough. Their noses are flat, mouths wide, and their lips, particularly the upper one, much swelled out.\nThe oriental negroes being much divided into small communities or families, little connected with each other, their language is broken into a multitude of dialects, which, in process of time, by separation, accident, and oral corruption, have nearly lost all resemblance. The Malays of the peninsula consider the language of the blacks of the hills as a mere jargon, which can only be compared to the chattering of large birds; and the Papuan dialects, in many of the eastern isles, are generally viewed in the same light.\n\nThe inhabitants of the more westerly islands of the eastern Archipelago buy the Papuas for slaves, and the natives of the west coast of New Guinea make slaves of those of the east, and sell them to strangers. The latter have the gristle between the nostrils pierced with tortoise-shell. About April and March the Papuas of New Guinea and Salwatty assemble in great numbers, and make war on Gilolo, Ceram, Amboyna, Ambloo, and as far west as Xulla Bessy.\n\nThe Arabians, in their early voyages, appear frequently to have encountered the Papuas, whom they describe in the most frightful colours, and constantly represent as cannibals. Tannah Papua was first discovered by Europeans in 1511, when it was visited by Antonio Ambren and Francis Serrano. From the Portuguese names given to certain harbours, bays, and islands, on the north coast of New Guinea, it would seem that nation, in former times, had much frequented this region; for its modern appellation it is indebted to the frizzled locks of its inhabitants.\n\nWhen the Moluccas were first visited by the Portuguese, the interior was in most of them occupied by this race; but they have ever since been rapidly decreasing, and in most of the smaller islands have wholly disappeared. Captain Forrest endeavours to account for this decrease, by attributing it to the numerous proselytes gained to the Mahommedan faith; on which event, he says, they either cut their hair off, or smooth it down straight with a comb: other physical properties would, however, betray their origin, and the success of the last expedient may reasonably be doubted. New diseases, vices, and wants, the consequence of a civilized vicinity, and the being driven from the sea coast to the unwholesome jungles and swamps of the interior, supply more probable causes for the gradual disappearance of the Papuas, where the Malays have established themselves in any numbers. With the natives of Papua the British have as yet had very little intercourse. In 1791, when the Panther (a Bombay cruiser) was off the coast of New Guinea, the natives decoyed the surgeon into their canoes, and murdered him; after which they discharged a shower of arrows into the ship, and wounded four of the crew. They were dispersed by the great guns and small arms. (Forrest, Leyden, Sonnerat, &c.)\n\nParagong, (Paragrama).\u2014A town in Northern Hindostan, in the province of Bootan, the capital of a district of the same name. Lat. 27\u00b0, 43'. N. Long. 89\u00b0, 21'. E.\n\nThe governor of the district, whose jurisdiction is of the first importance in Bootan, has his residence here. It extends from the frontiers of Tibet to the borders of Bengal; to Dalimcotta adjoining the territories of the Segwin, or Seecum Rajah; and it comprehends the low lands at the foot of the Luckidwar Mountains. The palace, or castle of Paro, is constructed, and the surrounding ground laid out, more with a view to strength and defence, than almost any other place in Bootan. The Valley of Paro exceeds that of Tassisu-don by a mile. It lies N. W. and S. E. and is irregularly intersected by the river. This is almost the only market in Bootan that is much frequented, and it is also famous for\nthe manufacture of images, and the forging of arms, particularly swords and daggers, and the bars of arrows. (Turner, &c.)\n\nParkundy.(Parakhandi).\u2014A town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Malwah, 78 miles north from Ooijain. Lat. 24\u00b0 19'. N. Long. 75\u00b0 38'. E.\n\nParkur.\u2014A small district in Hindostan, situated about the 24th degree of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by the sandy desert; on the south by Cutch; to the east it has Gujrat, and on the west the province of Sinde. Coming from Gujrat, after crossing the Run, which takes a sweep round the north of Cutch, the Parkur district commences. Sinde begins about 30 miles beyond Pareenagur; in which, as also in Weerawow, Meer Gholaum Ali has a detachment of 15 or 20 men, who levy taxes on the zemindars for their subsistence.\n\nThis country has been seldom visited by Europeans, but is described by the natives as of a sandy, rocky nature, indifferently supplied with water, and in many respects resembling Halliar in Gujrat. Cultivation is carried on by means of water procured from wells and tanks. Cloths of different descriptions, and a few horses, are occasionally transported through this district from Sinde to Gujrat; but on account of the insecurity trade of all sorts is of little amount. The Parkur territory is said to contain between 40 and 50 villages; the capital is Pareenuggur, commonly called Nuggur, and the residence of the Sodah Rajpoots.\n\nPareenuggur in its present state contains only 300 houses, chiefly inhabited by Sodah Rajpoots; the ancient population having long abandoned it on account of its turbulence, and migrated for safety to Noanagur and other places. The town is not fortified; the refuge of the inhabitants, when any enemy appears, being a neighbouring mountain, which is represented as rising to a great elevation. This mountain is named Callinjer, and may be seen at the distance of many miles. It is covered with jungle, and accessible only to those who are acquainted with its secret paths.\n\nThe principal chieftain in the Parkur district is Poonajjee of Weerawow, whose capital is surrounded by a wall, and contains about 600 houses. His great source of revenue is a celebrated idol which he possesses, named Goreecha, from its having originally come from Gor Bangalla (probably Gour in Bengal). It is carved of marble, is two feet high, in a sitting posture, with his legs across.\n\nAt a remote period of history when Pareenuggur flourished, it was inhabited by numerous families of Banyans, or Shrawuks, whose temples were famous for their elegance and sanctity, and resorted to by Shrawuks from every quarter, to pay their devotions at the shrines of Goreecha and Mandow Ray, who were considered as brothers. During the confusion and anarchy that followed the Mahommedan invasions, Mandow Ray fell into the hands of a body of Purmar Rajpoots, who removed from Parkur to Mooter in Chalawar, where they built a magnificent temple for Mandow Ray, in which he still resides. Goreecha, during the disorder, was seized on by a Rajpoot family, and concealed in the sand hills which lie to the N.W. of Parkur. Some years afterwards, when the influence of the Mahommedans of Sinde had declined, and the Sodah Rajpoots had regained the ascendancy, Goreecha was reproduced, and the news of his safety attracted Shrawuks from every region to pay their devotions to him; for permission to do which the possessor levied a heavy fine, which the Banyans consented to pay. Subsequent to this period the idol passed from hand to hand, and is at present in the possession of Poonajjee of Weerawow, whose grandfather Sutajee stole him from a Rajpoot of Pareenagur.\nThe pilgrimages to this Hindu deity are made in caravans of many thousand persons, who have agents at Rahdunpoor, who settle beforehand with the different Coolee chiefs for a safe conveyance to the spot where the idol is to be seen. He is then dug out of the sand, and placed under a guard of Rajpoots with drawn sabres, while the pilgrims perform their worship, and make offering in proportion to their circumstances. These gifts are deposited in a large chest, and afterwards divided between the Sodah Rajah and his attendants. Numerous fees are exacted during the ceremonies, and are paid with extraordinary liberality by the votaries, who are on all other occasions a most parsimonious race.\n\nAfter the ceremonies have continued for a few days, the image is privately removed, and parties of horsemen gallop off in every direction, one of whom has charge of the idol, whose actual place of concealment is known only to a very few confidential persons. In 1809 one party, or sungi, as it is called from Surat, amounted to 9000, besides those expected from other quarters, the whole being computed at 70,000 persons, who were to assemble at Morwarra, where the ceremony would be performed. The rajah who possesses this stone frequently anticipates his revenue, and mortgages the approaching fees and offerings expected to be realized, for so large a sum as one and a half lack of rupees. Besides the sums levied at the place of worship, all the adjacent towns and chiefs extort contributions from these pious devotees, who, owing to their immense numbers, suffer likewise many hardships in this barren region. (Macnardo, &c.)\n\n**Parrella, (Parnalaya).**\u2014A town and district in the province of Bejaipoor, reputed one of the most healthy in the Maharatta dominions. Lat. 16\u00b0 50'. N. Long. 74\u00b0 15'. E. Patanglur is the capital fortification, and is a place of considerable strength.\n\nOn the 4th April, 1701, Sir Wm. Norris, the ambassador from the English East India Company (while two separate and rival companies existed), arrived in Aurengzebe's camp, then stationed at this place; and, on the 28th, went to the audience with vast pomp. He remained in the camp until the 5th Nov. 1701, endeavouring to accomplish the objects of his mission, practising every eastern intrigue, and liberal both of bribes and promises. He was, however, completely out intrigued by the Mogul courtiers, and returned much disgusted and chagrined; the embassy from the beginning having cost the English East India Company 80,000l. an enormous sum at that period. Towards the conclusion of his negociation it was intimated to him by Aurengzebe, that the English best knew if it were their interest to trade in his dominions; and if the ambassador persisted in refusing the obligation required, he knew the same road back to England which he had come. The obligation required by Aurengzebe was, that the English East India Company should make good all losses which his Mogul subjects might sustain from pirates. (Bruce, Moor, &c.)\n\n**Parsonauth, (Parswanatha).**\u2014Samet Sichara, called in Major Rennell's map Parsonauth, is situated among the hills between Bahar and Bengal. Its holiness is held in great estimation by the Jainas, and it is said to be visited by pilgrims from the remotest parts of India. Parswa, or Parswanath, the 23rd deified saint of the Jainas, and who perhaps was the real founder of the sect, was born in the suburbs of Benares, and died at the age of 100 years on Mount Sammeya, or Samet. (Cobrooke, &c.)\n\n**Parsees.\u2014See Gujrat and Bombay.**\n\n**Parupanada.\u2014A Moplay town on the sea-coast of the Malabar province, 22 miles south from Calicut. Lat. 11\u00b0 2', N. Long. 75\u00b0 55'. E.**\nThis place contains about 700 houses mostly built of stone, and well aired, and which would be comfortable even for Europeans. When compared with that at Madras the surf on this coast is trifling, and except where rocky head lands run a little way into the sea, boats of any kind may without danger land on the coast. The small town of Vaypura was originally called North Parupanada. Its situation is very fine on the north side of a river where it enters the sea. Within the river has deep water, but, like all those on this coast, it has a bar at the mouth. At favourable seasons, vessels drawing 14 feet water, may be floated over the bar by means of casks.\n\nFrom two to 3000 teak trees may be procured here annually. The timber is cut on the mountains, and conveyed by elephants to the part of the river which, in the rainy season, has sufficient water to float it. Many of the best trees are cut in two to enable the elephants to drag them, by which many of them are rent and otherwise injured. Teak timber of an ordinary quality for ship building sells at 10 rupees per 11 square feet. The foot, therefore, costs from 1s. 6d. to 2s. and choice timber 2s. 10d. per cubical foot. At Baypoor a saw mill has been erected with the view of supplying the dock-yards at Bombay, but the moving power being wind, it appears too precarious for the heavy machinery required. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nPASAY.\u2014A town in Sumatra, once the principal seat of government in this extremity of the island. It is situated in a fine bay, where cattle, provisions, and grain, are in plenty, with large timber fit for masts growing close to the shore.\n\nPASSAGE ISLE.\u2014A low sandy isle, covered with trees, lying off the west coast of Sumatra, which here forms a deep bay named Bancongter, where are several Malay ports. Lat. 2\u00b0. 31'. N. Long. 97\u00b0. 55'. E.\n\nPASSAMAN.\u2014A small district in Sumatra, situated nearly under the equinoctial line, formerly under the dominion of Menangcabou, but now subject to the Acheenees. Formerly it was a place of considerable trade, and, besides a great export of pepper, received much fine gold from the mountains of the Rau country, lying about three days journey inland. The inhabitants of these mountains are said to be Battas converted to Mahommedanism, and mixed with Malays. The greater part of the gold they now collect finds its way to the River Siak, and from thence to the eastern side of the island and the Straits of Malacca. (Marsden, &c.)\n\nPASSAROOWAN.\u2014The capital of a large district in the eastern quarter of the Island of Java. Lat. 7\u00b0. 36'. S. Long. 113\u00b0. 10'. E.\n\nThe town of Passaroowan is intersected by a river which is navigable for some leagues up the country for coasting vessels, and crossed by a wooden bridge. A resident on the part of the Dutch government is established here with two subalterns and a few European soldiers, with some companies of Malays, to guard a small stone fort erected to check the natives.\n\nIn the neighbourhood are several plantations of coffee and pepper belonging to the Dutch East India Company, and also a yard for building coasting vessels of a small size. Two leagues inland is a hill on which all kinds of European vegetables are cultivated, which degenerate surprisingly little. The commandant or resident's house faces the bridge, and is a commodious and capacious building; his appointment is one of the most lucrative in Java.\n\nPassaroowan and the adjacent district of Bangel towards the coast are remarkably fertile, and produce abundant crops of rice and maize. Numerous villages, surrounded by banana, cocoa nut, and papaya trees, are seen scattered over the flat country. The Dutch here are few, but the Javanese numerous, and their chief lives in considerable splendour. There are good roads and posts es-\nestablished along the coast of this district, which is so shallow that ships are obliged to anchor three and four miles from the shore. (Tombe, Bligh, &c., &c.)\n\nPassir.\u2014A town and district on the east coast of Borneo. Lat. 1\u00b0 57'. S. Long. 116\u00b0 10'. E. The town of Passir stands about 50 miles up a river of the same name, which has 16 reaches, and is joined by five other rivers. The town consists principally of 300 wooden houses on the north side of the river, mostly inhabited by Bugress merchants. The house and wooden fort of the sultan are on the south side. The tide in Passir Roads rises nine feet, and runs a good way above the town. Over the bar, at the mouth of the river, there is two fathoms water with a muddy bottom. At Passir the houses front the river; some have stages or wharfs in front, but there are no water lanes here, as at the town of Borneo. The river up at the town is fresh, and often very rapid.\n\nThe air here is refreshed by cooling breezes from the sea, otherwise the heat would be insupportable. The country is, nevertheless, very unhealthy, as it lies in a flat for many miles; is encircled with woods, and annually overflowed. When the waters retire a muddy slime is left on the surface, upon which the sun shining with perpendicular rays occasions thick fogs, which in the evening turn to rain, with cold chilling winds off the land. Another circumstance that contributes to the unhealthiness of the air, is the great number of frogs and other vermin left in the mud, which being destroyed by the heat of the sun occasion an intolerable stench.\n\nIn April the dry season begins, and continues to September, during which time the wind is easterly between the south coasts of Borneo and the Island of Java; but from September to April the winds are westerly, attended by violent storms of thunder, lightning, and rain. Exclusive of rice, which is very plentiful, the produce of this country is benzoin, musk, aloes, pepper, cassia, and long nutmegs; also various kinds of fruit, excellent mastic and other gums, particularly dragon's blood; honey, gold dust, and camphor, are likewise to be procured.\n\nThe exchange for the produce of this place is similar to the other parts of the Malay coast, viz. opium, guns, muskets, pistols, gunpowder, lead in pigs and sheets, iron and steel in narrow bars, hangers, knives, scissors, and other cutlery, cloths chintzes, carpets, spectacles, looking glasses, spy glasses, clock work, &c. The inhabitants of Passir are very fraudulent, and have cut off many ships by treachery. In their weights and measures they are unjust, and they make compositions to imitate some of the most valuable articles, particularly bars of gold, which is so artfully done that the imposition cannot be discovered unless the bars are cut quite through. At the mouth of the Passir River there are many Biajoos settled, who subsist by catching small shrimps, which after washing with salt water are exposed to a hot sun until putrid, and then beat in a mortar to a paste of a strong and palatable taste named ballachong. The language of this place is the Malay mixed with much Bugress.\n\nIn the year 1772 an attempt was made by the English East India Company to establish a factory here, which did not succeed. In 1774 L'Epreuve, a vessel belonging to the King of France, was treacherously cut off here, and the crew assassinated by the attendants of one of the Malay chiefs, while the latter with his suite was at dinner with the captain and officers in the cabin, whom they stabbed on a preconcerted signal being given. An armed vessel manned with Europeans was dispatched next year from Chandernagore in Bengal to inflict punishment. By this expedition about 300 of the natives of this part of Borneo were destroyed, and a great many prawns\nand vessels; but the vengeance was blindly directed; for among the 300 destroyed there were, probably, very few of the perpetrators of the massacre of 1774. The instructions from the council at Chandernagore, among other particulars, direct the captain, \"that having seized a number of prisoners on the coast to put them on shore again, after having cut off their ears and noses, and from some also one hand.\" (Elmore, Sonnerat, Forrester, Starovius, Leyden, &c.)\n\nPassumman.\u2014A district in Sumatra, which nearly borders on Rejang southwards. This is an extensive and comparatively populous country, bounded on the north by that of Lamattang, and on the S. E. by that of Lampung. It is governed by four pangerans, who are independent of each other, but acknowledge a kind of sovereignty in the Sultan of Palembang. In the low countries, where the pepper planters reside, the title of Kalippa prevails, which is a corruption of the Arabic word Khalifah, signifying a viceregent. (Marsden, &c.)\n\nPata Isle.\u2014One of the small Sooloo Islands, lying due south from Sooloo. It is inhabited, and contains a good stock of cattle. It also contains three pits of very white saltpetre earth, which yields one-eighth of saltpetre.\n\nPatan.\u2014A town in the province of Ajmeer, district of Harowty, situated on the S. E. side of the Chumbul, which is here stony, uneven, and slippery. Lat. 25\u00b0. 17'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 50'. E. This town contains a palace, and also a temple, dedicated to Vishnu, erected by the Rajahs of Boondee. In 1790 it was the head of a pargannah, containing 32 villages, half of which belonged to Sindia, and half to Holcar.\n\nPatatan.\u2014A small town on the N. W. coast of Borneo, situated on the River Patatan, which lies to the southward of Pulo Gaya, and has a smooth and shallow bar. The town stands three or four miles up the river, and contains about 100 houses fronting the water. Above the town are many pepper gardens belonging to the Chinese. Further down the coast is Papal River; the banks of which abound so much with cocoanut trees, that during the floods many of the nuts are carried to sea. Lat. 5\u00b0. 50'. N. Long. 116\u00b0. 5'. E. (Elmore, &c.)\n\nPaternoster Isles.\u2014A great number of small rocky isles in the Eastern Isles, surrounded by numerous shoals, which render the navigation extremely dangerous, and situated about the 118th degree of east longitude, and seventh of south latitude.\n\nPatery.\u2014A hilly and woody district in the Nizam's territories, in the province of Berar, bounded on the south by the Godavery River, and situated between the 19th and 20th degrees of north latitude. The chief towns are Patery and Hastee. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Pahtery, containing 18 mahals; revenue, 80,705,954 dams; seyurghal, 11,580,954 dams.\"\n\nPatery.\u2014A town in the Nizam's territories, in the province of Berar, situated on the north bank of the Godavery River, 78 miles S. E. from Aurungabad. Lat. 19\u00b0. 18'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 8'. E.\n\nPatgong, (Patragrama).\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Rungpoor, 38 miles N. N. W. from Rungpoor. Lat. 26\u00b0. 18'. N. Long. 88\u00b0. 55'. E.\n\nPatincor.\u2014A town in the Southern Carnatic, district of Marawas, 30 miles E. S. E. from Madura. Lat. 9\u00b0. 41'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 35'. E.\n\nPatna, (Padnavuti).\u2014A large city in the province of Bahar, of which it is the capital. Lat. 25\u00b0. 37'. N. Long. 85\u00b0. 15'. E. This place is situated on the south side of the Ganges, which is here five miles wide during the rainy season, and the eastern limits not discernable. The town of Patna is one continued street for many miles along the Ganges, the houses of the natives being\ngenerally of mud; but those of the Europeans, which extend from Bankipoor, are of brick, and make a very handsome appearance, which is not the case with the rest of the city. There are several large buildings of brick, but they are old, and without ornament. It was formerly fortified after the Hindostany manner, with a wall and small citadel, which are long gone to decay. The surrounding country is perfectly flat. This town is extremely prosperous and populous; but the number of inhabitants have never been correctly ascertained; they cannot, however, be estimated at less than 150,000, yet every article of food is remarkably cheap here.\n\nA large quantity of saltpetre is annually dispatched from hence to Calcutta, for internal consumption and exportation. Chintzes and diversities of various kinds are manufactured here, and also cloths resembling diaper and damask linen. In the vicinity flannels well wove, but ill filled, are made, and also a sort of canvas from cotton.\n\nThe Company many years ago erected a depot here to contain rice. It is a building of stone in the shape of a bee-hive, with two winding staircases on the outside, which have been ascended on horseback. By these stairs the grain is poured in at the top, there being a small door at the bottom to take it out. The walls at the bottom, although 21 feet thick, have given way\u2014a circumstance of very little consequence, as were it filled (which it never was) it would not contain one day's consumption for the inhabitants of the province. It originally cost 120,000 rupees. Here are also the remains of the British factory, where the massacre of 200 prisoners was perpetrated in 1763 by the German adventurer, Somro (Summers), then in the service of Meer Cossim; immediately after which the city was captured by the British troops under Major Adams, and has ever since remained in their possession. A monument, but without inscription, is erected to the memory of the sufferers in the European burying ground.\n\nAt Bankipoor, one of the suburbs of Patna, the East India Company's civil servants reside. The provincial court of appeal and circuit, its registers and clerks, the district and city court, with the commercial resident, collector, and other agents of the Company, compose a numerous establishment, with liberal appointments. The Patua division of the court of circuit comprehends the following districts, viz. 1. Ramgur; 2. Bahar; 3. Tirhoot; 4. Sarun; 5. Shahabad; 6. The city of Patna.\n\nPatna is a city of great antiquity, and supposed by some to be the site of the ancient Palibothra. By the modern Mahommedans it is named Azimabad, and by the Hindoos Sri Nagur.\n\nTravelling distance from Patna to Calcutta by Moorshedabad, 400 miles; by Birbhoon, 340; from Benares, by Buxar, 155; from Delhi, 661; from Agra, 544; and from Lucknow, 316 miles. (Rennel, Lord Valentia, Colebrooke, Tennant, 5th Report, &c.)\n\nPATREE.\u2014A town in the province of Gujrat, and the capital of a small district. Lat. 22\u00b0. 50'. N. Long. 71\u00b0. 35'. E.\n\nThis is a large and populous place, defended by three distinct walls, the inner of which is enclosed by a small ditch, which even in the dry season contains a considerable quantity of water. In remote times it was esteemed a place of strength, and it makes a considerable figure in the histories of Gujrat; but the fortifications are now in a state of decay, and in many places falling to pieces. A beautiful tank extends along the north face, and renders an attack from that quarter altogether impracticable; and the town, on the whole, is still one of the strongest places in India. To the north of Patree the country is tolerably well cultivated, but much interspersed with the milk\nbush and low baubool tree, the rind of which is a powerful astringent.\n\nPatree originally belonged to the Rajah of Drangdra, formerly an independent principality in Cotewar, but became the property of the present family through the interest of the Peshwa's government, which they had served for a series of years. The present chief is of the Koonbee caste, and only entitled Dessoy, although in reality he is the thakoor (lord) of the place and its dependencies. The inhabitants are chiefly Rajpoots and Koonbees; and the latter, when cultivating the fields, are seen armed with the bow and arrows of the Coolies. (Macnurdo, &c.)\n\nPattan, (Patana).\u2014A district in the province of Gujrat, situated about the 24th degree of north latitude. This district on the west is bounded by the Run, and 30 years ago belonged to Kumaulud Deen, the father of the present Nabob of Rahdumpoor; but he was then compelled by Dammajce Guicowar to abandon all pretensions to Pattan and its nine dependent pergannahs. The country is now but thinly inhabited, and much exposed to the ravages of the numerous predatory tribes in this quarter of Gujrat; but it contains the ancient capital of Gujrat, named Nehrwallah, or Pattan, which was afterwards transferred by the Mahommedan Sultans to Ahmedabad. The appellation Nehrwalla is written Anhulvado, and signifies the field of Anbul; in modern times it is known to the natives by the name of Pattan, or the city.\n\nBy Abul Fazel, in 1582, this district is described as follows:\u2014\"Sircar Putten, containing 16 mahals; measurement, 3,750,015 beegahs; revenue, 600,325,099 dams; seyurgal, 210,327 dams. This sircar furnishes 715 cavalry, and 6000 infantry.\" (Macnurdo, Drummond, &c.)\n\nPattan.\u2014A town in the Nizam's dominions, in the province of Aurungabad, 38 miles S.W. from the city of Aurungabad. Lat. 19\u00b0. 29'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 33'. E.\n\nPattan, (Patn).\u2014A town belonging to the Ghoorkhali Rajah, in the Valley of Nepali. Lat. 27\u00b0. 31'. N. Long. 85\u00b0. 40'. E. This city stands in a small but rather elevated plain, at the distance of a mile and a half from the south end of Catmandoo, the two capitals being separated by the Bhagmutty River. While Patn existed as an independent state it is said to have comprehended 24,000 houses, including its dependencies within the valley, of which the Patn sovereign possessed a greater portion than fell to the share of the Catmandoo or Bhatgong Rajahs. The dominions of Patn beyond the valley stretched southerly, comprehending Chitlong, Tambchkan, Cheesapany, and some other places in the same direction. It is a neater town than Catmandoo, and contains some very handsome edifices. By the Nevars it is termed Yulloodaisi. (Kirkpatrick, &c.)\n\nPatteelah, (Patyalaya, the Chief's Residence).\u2014A town belonging to a Seik chief, in the province of Delhi, 132 miles N.W. from the city of Delhi. Lat. 30\u00b0. 18'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 33'. E. This is a place of considerable extent, and now the most flourishing town in the district of Sirhind. It is surrounded with a mud wall, and in the centre there is a square citadel, in which the Rajah resides. (Maleolm, &c.)\n\nPauputtan, (or Ajodin).\u2014A town possessed by native chiefs, in the province of Mooltan, 130 miles E.by S. from the city of Mooltan. Lat. 30\u00b0. 20'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 30'. E. Near to this town is the tomb of Sheik Furreed, which was visited by Timour.\n\nPaungaow, (Paragrama).\u2014A small walled town belonging to the Maharattas, in the province of Aurungabad, 88 miles S.E. from Ahmednagar. Lat. 18\u00b0. 14'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 12'. E.\n\nPaulie, (Pahli).\u2014A town in the province of Ajmeer, and one of the greatest commercial marts in this part of Rajpootana. Here the mer-\nchants exchange the commodities of Europe, Persia, and the Deccan, for those of Cashmere, the Punjab, and Hindostan.\n\n**Pawanghur.**\u2014A fortified town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Bejaipoor, district of Parcella, of which it is the capital, and 42 miles S. by W. from Merritch. By the Maharattas it is considered as a place of great strength. Lat. 16\u00b0.52', N. Long. 74\u00b0.20'. E.\n\n**Peddabalararam.**\u2014A town in the Mysore Rajah's territories, 84 miles N. E. from Seringapatam. Lat. 13\u00b0.17', N. Long. 77\u00b0.47'. E. By the Mahomedans this town is called Burrah Balapoor, in the Telunga Puddabalapoor, in the Karnata Doda Balapoor, and by the English Great Balapoor. The fort, although entirely built of mud, is large and strong; one side is surrounded by gardens, and the other by the town of Balapoor, which contains above 2000 houses, and is fortified with a mud wall and hedge. The commerce of this place is inconsiderable; In the neighbourhood are many kitchen gardens, but the soil is poor, although water is found near the surface. Maize is cultivated, but seldom converted into flour.\n\nOn the dissolution of the Bijanagur kingdom, Narayan Swami, the polygar of Balapoor, assumed independency. It was afterwards conquered by the Mogul army under Cossim Khan, and wrested from them by the Maharattas, with whom it remained until the battle of Paniput, when it was seized on by the Nizam, and subsequently subdued by Hyder. In this town was born Meer Saduc, the minister of Tippoo Sultaun. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\n**Peddapore, (Padmapura).**\u2014A town in the Northern Circars, district of Rajamundry, 25 miles E. N. E. from the town of Rajamundry. Lat. 17\u00b0.5', N. Long. 82\u00b0.15'. E. Sugar to a considerable extent is cultivated in the Peddapore zeminary, along the banks of the Eliseram River. A battle was fought here in 1758 between the French army, commanded by M. de Couflans, and the English, commanded by Colonel Forde, in which the former were totally defeated. (Roxburgh, Orme, &c.)\n\n**Pedir.**\u2014A town on the west coast of the Island of Sumatra. The principal exports of this place are betel nut, pepper, gold dust, canes, rattans, bees' wax, camphor, and benzoin. The soil is fertile, and well watered with rivulets; but in the low lands next the sea are bogs and marshes, which produce only reeds, rattans, and bamboo canes. The domestic animals are horses of a small breed, buffaloes, goats, oxen, and hog deer. There are many wild animals in the mountains, such as tigers, rhinoceroses, monkeys, wild hogs, spotted deer, and bears. There are also alligators, guanas, porcupines, serpents, scorpions, and other venomous reptiles. Poultry is to be had here in abundance, particularly ducks and fowls. (Elmore, &c.)\n\n**Pedra Blanca.**\u2014A large elevated rock, perfectly white, situated in the sea of China. Lat. 22\u00b0.19'. N. Long. 114\u00b0.57'. E.\n\n**Peelas Isles.**\u2014A cluster of small islands in the Eastern Seas, situated due west of Bassecolan. Plenty of cowries are found along the beach of these islands, but they are said to be destitute of fresh water.\n\n**Peergaum, (Pirgrama, the Saints' Village).**\u2014A town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Aurungabad, 68 miles east from Poona. Lat. 18\u00b0.32', N. Long. 75\u00b0.2'. E. The Beemah and Sursuty rivers join close to the S. E. of the town, and form the point on which the houses and fortress stand.\n\n---\n\n**PEGU.**\n\nAn ancient kingdom in India beyond the Ganges, which now forms one of the southern provinces of the Birman empire. The word Pegu appears to be a corruption of Bago, the vulgar name of its capital.\nThe original inhabitants denominate themselves Mon; by the Chinese and Birmanus they are termed Taling; and, by the Siamese, Mingmon. The province of Pegu extends along the mouths of two great rivers, Irawaddy and Thanlwyn, (or of Ava and Martaban) and occupies the seacoast from the frontiers of Aracan to those of Siam. The town of Prome was its northern frontier.\n\nThe river of Pegu, which was supposed to come from China, rises among the hills about 100 miles from the sea, which form the boundaries between the Birman and Pegu countries. Its communication with the sea is by the Rangoon River, and in the fair season it is almost dry. The country inland from the river is clear of trees and brushwood; but on the banks of the river there are thickets, which abound with the domestic fowl in a wild state, and peacocks, but is also infested with tigers. About a day's journey to the south of the town of Pegu the inhabitants are much molested by wild elephants, that occupy in great numbers a forest to the north east. These powerful animals, allured by the early crops of rice and sugar-cane, make predatory incursions in large troops, and do a great deal of mischief, devastating much more than they devour. This province appears to be the favourite abode of the elephant; and one of his Birman majesty's titles is, \"Lord of the White Elephant, and of all the Elephants in the World.\"\n\nPegu having long been subject to the Birman empire of Ava, the history of its conquest and other particulars will be found under the article Ava. When the Birmans had completed its subjugation they subdivided it into 32 districts, and named it Henzawuddy, which is the sanscrit name for the whole province. Mindeyace Praw, the fifth king of the present dynasty, abrogated many severe penal laws imposed by his predecessors upon the native Peguers. Justice is now distributed with considerable impartiality, and the only distinction at present between a Birman and Peguer consists in the exclusion of the latter from places of public trust and power. In Pegu there are no brick buildings allowed, except such as belong to the king, or are dedicated to their divinity Gaudma, his majesty having prohibited the use of brick and stone in private buildings.\n\nFrom the plenty of teak with which the Pegu forests abound this province has long been famous for shipbuilding. So early as 1707 the Arabs of Muscat, then a considerable maritime power, were accustomed to build ships here, some of which carried from 30 to 50 guns. For the procuring of this valuable timber a great intercourse subsists between Pegu and all the British provinces, particularly Bengal, where the vessels are almost wholly fabricated from Pegu teak, with the assistance of the country timber.\n\nThe inhabitants of Pegu appear to have attained civilization at a more early period than the Birmans, and, though now reduced, formerly to have been a great and potent nation. In the early Portuguese histories they are denominated the Pandalus of Mon, and they are supposed to have founded the ancient Kalamingham empire. The name Kalamingham, mentioned by the Portuguese, is probably connected with the Siamese name of the nation, Mingmon. The Mon language is still used by the inhabitants of Pegue, and appears quite original. It is said by the Birmans and Siamese to have no affinity to either of their languages.\n\nOwing to the long and sanguinary wars carried on between the Birmans and Peguers, the greater part of this province, although one of the most productive in India, remains desolate and uncultivated; and it will require a very long period of tranquility to restore Pegu to its former population. (Symes, Leyden, Fr. Buchanan, Cox, &c.)\n\nPEGU.\u2014A city in the Birman empire, the capital of the province of\nPegu, and situated 90 miles by water above Rangoon. Lat. 17\u00b0. 40'. Long. 96\u00b0. 12'. E.\n\nThe extent of ancient Pegu may still be traced by the ruins of the ditch and wall that surround it. From these it appears to have been a quadrangle, each side measuring 1\u00bd miles; the breadth of the ditch was about 60 yards, and the depth 10 or 12 feet. When in repair, even in the dry season, the ditch had seldom less than four feet of water. The wall was composed of brick badly cemented with clay mortar, about 35 feet thick, with small equidistant bastions about 300 yards asunder; but the whole in a most ruinous state. The Birman monarch, Alompra, when he acquired possession of the city in 1757, razed every building to the ground, and dispersed or led into captivity all the inhabitants. The temples, or praws, which are very numerous, were the only buildings that escaped his fury, and of these the great pyramid of Shoemadoo has alone been reverenced and kept in repair.\n\nAbout 1790, Mindua\u00e7e Praw, the reigning monarch, to conciliate the natives, issued orders to rebuild Pegu, and invited the scattered families of former inhabitants to repopulate their deserted city. At the same time he ordered the viceroy to quit Rangoon, and make Pegu his future residence, and the seat of provincial government. The present inhabitants, who have been induced to return, consist chiefly of rhahauns, or priests, the followers of the court, and a few poor Pegu families. The men of business continue to reside at Rangoon, and the whole number of inhabitants of this town do not as yet exceed 7000. A great proportion of the former inhabitants are either extinct, or scattered over the provinces of Tongho, Martahan, and Talowmeon.\n\nThe city of Pegu, in its renovated state, is fenced round with a stockade from 10 to 12 feet high. There is one main street running east and west, crossed at right angles by two smaller streets. At each extremity of the principal street there is a gate defended by a wretched piece of ordnance, and a few musketeers, who never post sentinels, and are generally asleep in a neighbouring shed. The streets of Pegu are spacious and paved with brick, which the ruins of the old town plentifully supply. The houses are all made of mats, or of sheathing boards, supported on bamboos or posts, and extremely combustible. As a precaution against fire, at each door there stands a long bamboo, with an iron hook to pull down the thatch; and there is also another pole, adapted to suppress flame by pressure. Almost every house has earthen pots filled with water on the roof, and a particular class of people, whose business is to prevent and extinguish fires, walk the street during the night.\n\nThe object in the city of Pegu that attracts the most notice, is the temple of Shoemadoo Praw\u2014Shoe, in the Birman tongue, signifies golden, and Madoo appears a corruption of Mahadco.\u2014This temple is a pyramidal building, composed of brick and mortar, without excavation or aperture of any sort, octagonal at the base, and spiral at the top; each side of the base measuring 162 feet. The great breadth diminishes abruptly in the shape of a speaking trumpet. The extreme height of the building, above the level of the country, is 361 feet. On the top is an iron tee, or umbrella, 56 feet in circumference, which is gilt, and it is the intention of the king to gild the whole building.\n\nOn the north side of the building are three large bells of good workmanship, suspended near the ground, to announce to the spirit of Gaudina the approach of a suppliant, who places his offering, consisting of boiled rice, a plate of sweetmeats, or a cocoa nut fried in oil, on a bench near the foot of the temple. After it is offered the devotee\nseems indifferent what becomes of it, and it is often devoured in his presence by the crows or dogs, whom he never attempts to disturb during their repast.\n\nNumberless images of Gaudia lie indiscriminately scattered about. A pious Birman, who purchases an idol, first procures the ceremony of consecration to be performed by the rhahaans, or monks; he then takes his purchase to whatever sacred building is most convenient, and thus places it within a kioun, or on the open ground before the temple; nor does he seem to have the least anxiety about its future preservation. Some of these idols are made of marble found in the neighbourhood of Unnerapoor, and capable of receiving a very fine polish; many are of wood gilded, and a few of silver; the latter, however, are not exposed like the others. Silver and gold is rarely used, except in the composition of household gods. The rhahaans assert, that the temple of Shoemadoo Praw was begun 2300 years ago, and built by successive monarchs.\n\nAbout 40 miles from the town of Pegu are the Galladzet Hills, remarkable for their pestilential atmosphere. Around this town a few miserable villages, with very little cultivation, shew the poverty of the peasants. Rice, gnapee (a species of sprat which, when half putridised, is made into a pickle, and as a seasoning for the rice), oil expressed from a small grain and salt, are almost their only articles of food. They have cattle, but they do not eat the flesh; and, what is more extraordinary, seldom drink the milk. The cows are diminutive, resembling those on the coast of Coromandel; but the buffaloes are superior to those of India. The only article of consequence manufactured at Pegu is silk and cotton, which the females weave for domestic use. The thread is well spun, and the texture of the web close and strong, being chequered like tartan.\n\nThe chief officers in Pegu are the maywoon (viceroy), the raywoon, the chekey, and the seredogee. These officers exercise the functions of magistrates, and hold separate courts at their own houses for the determination of petty suits; but this private jurisdiction is very limited. All causes of importance relating to property are tried in open court. The three inferior officers above-mentioned united form a tribunal, which sits in the rhoon, or public hall of justice, where they hear parties, examine witnesses, and take depositions in writing. These documents are sent to the viceroy, and the judges transmit their opinions along with the evidence, which the viceroy either confirms or rejects; and, in case of conviction, orders execution, or pardons the criminal. (Symes, &c.)\n\nPeinghie.\u2014A town in the Birman empire, situated on the west side of the Irawaddy. Lat. 18\u00b0. 31'. N. Long. 94\u00b0. 50'. E. In the vicinity of this place a great part of the teak timber is procured, which is carried to Rangoon, and from thence exported to the British territories. The forests extend along the western mountains, and are in sight from the river. The trees are felled in the dry season, and when the monsoon sets in are borne down by the current of the Irawaddy. Here also ships of 400 tons are frequently built, although the distance from Rangoon, including the windings of the river, be 150 miles. (Symes, &c.)\n\nPelaigne.\u2014A town tributary to the Maharattas, in the province of Agra, 12 miles N. from Narwar. Lat. 25\u00b0. 51'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 8'. E.\n\nPelauddah.\u2014A large village in the Rajpoot territories, in the province of Ajmeer, said to contain 1000 houses, 70 miles E. S. E. from Jyenaugur. Lat. 26\u00b0. 36'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 45'. E.\n\nPeling Isle.\u2014An island situated off the east coast of Celebes, between the 123d and 124th degrees\nof east longitude. In length it may be estimated at 50 miles, by 15 the average breadth; but, excepting its geographical position, scarcely anything is known respecting it. To the east of Peling are many smaller isles, with numerous rocks and shoals.\n\nPeloo Isles, (or Palos Isles).\u2014A cluster of small islands in the Eastern Seas, situated principally between the seventh and eighth degrees of north latitude, and the 134th and 135th of east longitude. They were probably first noticed by the Spaniards from the Philippines, and by them named Palos Isles; the tall palm trees, which grow there in great abundance, having at a distance the appearance of masts, which the term Palos nautically denotes. To the north there is one large island, named Bambelthouap, which is about 60 miles in circumference; to the south are a great number of very small islands, the chief of which are Caroora, Oroolong, Pelelew, and Angoor.\n\nThese islands are, in general, well wooded, some of the trees being of the largest dimensions, and capable of forming a canoe able to contain 30 persons. Ebony is also found here, and a species of machineel tree, the sap of which blisters the skin. There are also cabbage trees, and the wild bread fruit trees. Yams and cocoa nuts are the chief articles of sustenance, and are attended to with great care, the latter being in large plantations. The betel nut abounds also; but, contrary to the custom in India, the natives only use it when green; the other productions of these islands are plantains, bananas, oranges, lemons, some sugar canes, bamboos in plenty, and turmeric. None of the islands visited by the English had any kind of grain, nor any quadruped whatever, except some brownish grey rats, and three or four meagre cats, which were seen in some houses, and probably had been wrecked on the coast.\n\nThe common domestic fowls abound in the woods, but were not eaten by the natives until the English set the example; yet they reared pigeons on purpose for food. Along the shores are a great variety of fish, with many shell-fish, particularly the large Kima cockle (the chama gigas of Linnaeus), which they procure by diving, and which they commonly eat raw.\n\nThe soil is in general rich, and produces plenty of excellent grass. There are no rivers of magnitude, but many small streams and ponds. They extract saccharine matter from the palm tree, with which, and cocoa nut scrapings, they make sweetmeats, which acquire such hardness by keeping, that a knife will hardly penetrate it; on which account it was denominated by the seamen choke-dog. The natives have no salt, nor do they make use of salt or seasoning to any thing they eat. They drink very little, and have no intoxicating liquors.\n\nTheir seasons are divided into wet and dry, as in other tropical countries, and they have no method of measuring time but by the height of the sun. All the Peloo Isles visited by the English appeared populous, and one of the expeditions of the smaller central islands against Pelelew was estimated to consist of 4000 men. Their houses are raised about three feet from the ground, are placed on stones, and extremely well suited to the climate. Their best knives are made of a piece of mother-of-pearl oyster shell, and their fishing hooks of tortoise shell. They make vessels of earthen ware, in which they boil their fish and yams. Their hatchets are made of part of the Kima cockle, ground to a sharp edge.\n\nThe principal weapons used in battle are spears, 12 feet long, made of bamboo, pointed with some hard wood, and darts and slings. Their battles are generally fought in canoes, which they make from the trunk of a tree, with an out-rigger.\nand furnished with latine sails made of matting.\n\nThe natives of the Peloo Islands are well made, and rather above the middle stature; their complexions being deeper than the Indian copper colour, but not black. Their hair is long and flowing, and inclined to curl. The men go entirely naked, but the women wear little aprons or fringes, made from the husk of the cocoa nut, and dyed yellow. When both sexes grow up, their teeth are blacked by means of a dye, and they get tattooed. During the continuance of the English with the natives of Pelew, they never saw any particular ceremonies, or observed any thing that had the appearance of public worship. Their conduct to the crew of the Antelope, when wrecked in 1783, was so kind and benevolent, as to entitle them to a high place in the moral scale; yet their incessant wars, and their practice of massacring their prisoners, indicate a disposition sanguinary and ferocious. The latter custom they attempted to extenuate by the plea of political necessity.\n\nTheir advancement in civilization is, in some respects, considerable. When the English belonging to the Antelope visited the town of Pelelew, they found it defended by a stone wall, thrown up across the causeway, which led up to the town. This wall was 10 or 12 feet high, with a foot bank of stone raised behind, upon which they could stand, and throw their spears at their enemies. Some of the public buildings, named Pyes, are 60 feet long, and constructed with a surprising strength and neatness, considering their tools, and their towns are built with much regularity.\n\nThe largest of the Peloo Islands, named Babelthouap, is divided into several districts, or governments, of which Artingall is the largest. The capital of this district is named Mallogryoke, where the king resides, who is in a state of constant hostility with the smaller Peloo Islands to the south, which were formerly governed by Abba Thulle, the sovereign of Caroora. The other districts on Babelthouap are Angrarth, and Emmelcigue, the whole island being about 60 miles in circumference. The pier at Mallogayoki is a wonderful fabric, considering by whom it was built. It is about one mile in length, 12 feet in height, and 15 broad at the top, but considerably more at the base; built entirely of coral rocks, piled up, and extends from the town to within 12 yards of the outer reef.\n\nIn return for the kindness shewn by Abba Thulle, the Prince of Peloo, to the crew of the Antelope, wrecked on the Island of Ooroolong in 1783, in the year 1791 the East India Company sent him as a present four young cows in calf, and two young bulls from Lebojee, and 10 ewes and two rams of the Bengal breed; eight she-goats and two rams of the Surat breed; five sows in pig, and two boars from Bombay; two geese, three ducks, and one mallard from Benecoolen; two hens, eight turtle doves, and two parrots from Allass; which were all landed in good condition; besides seeds of various sorts, European swords, and hardware, with arms and ammunition.\n\nIn 1791 the captain of the Panther, a Bombay cruizer, was so pleased with the manners of the natives, that he resigned his command, determined to spend the remainder of his life among them; but, after a residence of 15 months, he grew tired, and sailed in his pinnace to Macao. The stock left in the Peloo Islands had greatly increased in 1802, with the exception of the sheep, which had failed. At that time several Europeans resided on the islands, for the purpose of collecting biche de mar, tortoise shell, and shark fins for the China market.\n\nThe jesuits of Manilla, in 1696, made an attempt to reduce the Islands of Palaos, or Peloo, which were then understood to consist of\n32 in number, and to be very populous; but it was not until 1710 that they made good a landing. A party of Jesuits, attended by 12 of the ship's company, then landed with the intention of planting the cross; but they probably met with some disaster, as, after waiting a considerable time, the ship was obliged to sail without them, and they never were afterwards heard of. Two ships were subsequently dispatched in search of them, one of which was lost, and the other failed in the attempt to reach Peloo. (Keating and Supplement, Maccluer, Zuniga, &c.)\n\nPemgur, (or Poongur).\u2014A town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Khandesh, situated on the south side of the Nerbudda River, 73 miles S. E. from Oojain. Lat. 22\u00b0. 28'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 35'. E.\n\nPenang Isle.\u2014See Prince of Wales' Island.\n\nPennar River.\u2014This is said to have its source not far from Nundydroog, and in Sanscrit is called Uttara Pinakani, from its northerly course. It flows at first in a northerly direction, until it approaches Gooty, and then takes a south-east course by Gandicotta and Cuddapah; after which it changes to the east, and reaches the sea at Gungapatnam, after passing the fortress of Nellore. (F. Buchanon, Remmel, &c.)\n\nPennatore.\u2014A town on the seacoast of Travancore, 58 miles N. W. from Cape Comorin. Lat. 8\u00b0. 25'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 55'. E. Here the late Rajah of Travancore had an entirely new harbour constructed, where the European and Chinese ships anchored in order to load pepper.\n\nPera, (Perak).\u2014A district in the Malay Peninsula, extending along the Straits of Malacca, and situated principally between the fourth and fifth degrees of north latitude.\n\nAt the mouth of the Pera River the tide runs very strong, especially after the rains. It will admit a vessel of 12 or 14 feet draught of water, and is navigable up to the Dutch factory at Tanjong Putees. The surrounding country is flat, and favourable for the cultivation of rice. It abounds with the aneebong tree, which is fit for many uses, and has a head like a cabbage. Cattle and poultry are not so cheap here as at Quedah, but there are plenty of oysters at the river's mouth.\n\nThe Dutch East India Company had formerly a fort in this district, for protecting the collection of the tin which is dug here. They formerly used to contract with the sultan for all the tin produced at 10 Spanish dollars per pecul of 133\u00bd pounds, but much of it was smuggled away by interlopers. In this district the Malay language is spoken in great purity. (Forrest, Stavorinus, Leyden, &c.)\n\nPera Isle, (Pulo Pera).\u2014A barren rock as high as the hull of a large ship, lying off the west coast of the Malay Peninsula, which may be seen many leagues off. Lat. 5\u00b0. 50'. N. Long. 99\u00b0. 12'. E.\n\nPeriapatam, (Priya Patana, or the Chosen City).\u2014A town in the Mysore Rajah's territories, towards the borders of the Coorg country, 31 miles W. by S. from Seringapatam. Lat. 12\u00b0. 21'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 25'. E.\n\nThis city and domain formerly belonged to a polygar family, named Nandiraj. About 160 years ago the chieftain was attacked by Chica Deva Raya, the Curtur of the Mysore; and, finding himself unable to resist so powerful an enemy, he killed his wives and children, and then rushed into the midst of his enemies, where he died also. The desolation of this country appears to have arisen from its being a frontier between the sovereigns of Mysore and Coorg. On the approach of General Abercrombie's army, in 1790, Tippoo ordered both the town and fort to be destroyed. The fortifications are now quite ruinous, and in the inner fort there are no inhabitants, except some tigers.\n\nThe surrounding country is beautiful, but at the time it was conquered by the British did not con-\ntain one-fourth the number of inhabitants necessary for its cultivation. The natives in the vicinity declare they have never seen ice or snow on the top even of the highest hills. Bettadapoor, a hill about 15 miles north of Periapatam, is probably about 2000 feet above the level of the surrounding country, which is conjectured to be about 4000 feet above the level of the sea. Periapatam, in time of peace, is an entrepot of trade between the Coorg and Mysore sovereignties.\n\nSandal wood grows in the skirts of the forests. It is a strong soil that produces the best sandalwood, which in 12 years attains the most suitable size for being cut. The Periapatam district produces about 2000 hundred weight. The woods are much infested, and the crops injured, by wild elephants, which are more numerous on the borders of the Coorg country than either at Chittagong or in Pegu. The soil of these forests is, in general, good, and much of it black. They are very extensive, and reach to the foot of the Western Ghauts, but in this space there are many fertile tracts belonging to the Rajahs of Coorg and Wynaad. Among the trees are abundance of teak.\n\nHegedu Devana Cotay, about 20 miles to the south of Periapatam, is one of the most considerable districts for the production of sandal wood. To prepare the sandal wood, the billets should be buried in dry ground for two months, during which time the white ants will eat up all the outer wood without touching the heart, which is the sandal. The deeper the colour the higher the perfume, but the root sandal is the best. The largest billets are sent to China, and the middle sized billets used in India. The chops, fragments, and smaller assortment of billets, are best for the Arabian market, and from them the essential oil is distilled. The whole sandal wood of India is now in the possession of the East India Company and the Rajah of Mysore; and as it is an article of luxury, it is a very legitimate subject of monopoly. (F. Buchanan, &c., &c.)\n\nPeringary.\u2014A town in the Southern Carnatic, district of Marawas, 32 miles E. S. E. from Madura. Lat. 9\u00b0. 38'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 40'. E.\n\nPermacoil, (Permaculam, the large Pond, or Bath).\u2014A small town in the Carnatic, 72 miles S. S. W. from Madras, and 20 miles N. W. from Pondicherry. Lat. 12\u00b0. 13'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 52'. E.\n\nAfter the defeat sustained by the French at Wandiwash, in 1760, when the army fell back on Pondicherry, Permacoil, which before had been neglected, became a place of importance. The rock on which the Fort of Permacoil stood, does not extend, even at its base, more than 500 yards. Its breadth to the north is about 400 yards, and to the south not more than 200 yards. The height is various, being at the narrow end 300 perpendicular feet, and diminishing by slopes and declivities to 200 at the other. The rock falls everywhere so steep, that the area of the fortified surface above is equal to half the base below, and the adjacent rocks are not high enough to carry any detriment to its fortifications. It was taken in March, 1760, by Colonel Coote, who was wounded here, and during the attack the sepoys much distinguished themselves. (Orme, Fra Paolo, &c., &c.)\n\nPersaumah, (Parasu Rama).\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, district of Tirhoot, 90 miles N. E. by E. from Patna. Lat. 26\u00b0. 1'. N. Long. 86\u00b0. 32'.

In 1757 a piece of land, opposite to the old town of Persaim, was granted by Alompra, the founder of the present Birman dynasty, to the English East India Company, for the purpose of erecting a factory. (Symes, &c.)\n\nPerwuttum, (Perwatam, the Mountain).\u2014A village near the south bank\nof the River Krishna, in a wild tract of country almost uninhabited, except by the Chinsars, 118 miles south from Hyderabad. Lat. 15\u00b0. 57'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 40'. E. The rock of this neighbourhood is granite, in which the red colour predominates. Diamonds are found in this mountainous tract; but the labour so great, and the chance of meeting with the veins so uncertain, that the digging for them has been long discontinued.\n\nHere is a remarkable pagoda dedicated to a deity whom the attendant Brahmins call Mallecarjee, in the shewing of whom a great deal of mystery is observed. He is generally exhibited in the back part of the building, by the reflected light of a brass speculum, and of course can only be seen as the flashes fall on him. The idol is probably nothing more than the Lingam so much reverenced by the votaries of Siva. The revenues derived from the resort of pilgrims are collected by a manager, who resides within the enclosure. There is a goddess also worshipped here, named Brahma Rumbu. The several pagodas, choultries, courts, &c. are enclosed by a wall 660 feet long, by 510 broad, the walls of which are covered by an infinite variety of sculpture. (Mackenzie, \u00a7c.)\n\nPeshawer, (the advanced Post).\u2014An Afghan town and district in the province of Cabul, situated on the south side of the Kameh, or Cabul River, 40 miles west from the Indus. Lat. 33\u00b0. 22'. N. Long. 70\u00b0. 37'. E. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, this district is described as follows:\n\n\"The district Beckram, commonly called Peishore, enjoys a delightful spring season. Here is a temple called Gorchkehtery, a place of religious resort, particularly for Jogies. Tooman Beckram 9,692+10 dams.\"\n\nThe city of Peshawer was founded by the great Acher, who encouraged the inhabitants of the Punjab to resort to his new settlement, seeing the Afghans were so averse to the occupations of commerce. The city is large and populous, but the situation flat and unwholesome, being surrounded on every side by morasses. During the summer the heat is excessive, and in the height of the solstice the atmosphere is almost insupportable. The road from the Indus to Peshawer has nearly a west by south direction, and the country from Aekorah is sandy and interspersed with stones, but from thence to Peshawer are many tracts of land under cultivation.\n\nPeshawer from the convenience of its position unites, by a commercial intercourse, Persia and Afghanistan with India; and has become an important entrepot, the residence of many wealthy merchants, especially of shawl dealers. The markets are abundantly supplied with provisions, particularly with mutton, which is the flesh of the large tailed sheep. The inhabitants are principally Mahomedans and Hindoos, but there is also a small society of Jews. The territory adjacent to Peshawer is named Pokhtankha, or Afghanistan Proper, and with the city is governed by an Afghan officer, who remits the revenue, which, in 1783, was seven lacks of rupees, to the capital.

The Valley of Phari is very extensive, compared with the narrow slips of land in Bootan; and is the station of the Phari Lama, who is here a little potentate, being superintendent of a goombah or monastery, and governor of a most extensive tract of rocks and deserts, which yield verdure only during the mildest season of the year; at which time this neighbourhood is frequented by large herds of the long haired, bushy tailed cattle. The musk deer are also found in great abundance among these mountains.\n\nPerpetual winter may be said to reign at this fortress; Chumulari is forever clothed with snow, and from its remarkable form is probably the mountain which is occasionally visible from Purneah and Rajewall in Bengal. In this vicinity wheat does not ripen, yet it is sometimes cultivated as forage for cattle during the depth of winter. The plains and adjacent mountains are frequented by large droves of cattle, shawl goats, deer, musk deer, hares, and other wild animals. There are also partridges, pheasants, quails, and a great multitude of foxes. Such is said to be the intensity of the frost here, although in so low a latitude as 28\u00b0. N. that animals exposed in the open field are found dead, with their heads split open by its force.\n\nIn 1792 the Chinese established a military post at this place, on the southern frontier of Tibet towards Bootan, which circumstance put a stop to all communication between the northern states and the province of Bengal, the approach of strangers being utterly prohibited by the Chinese. (Turner, &c.)\n\n**Phak.**\u2014A district in the province of Cashmere, bounded on the west by the Jhyium, and situated in the 35th degree of north latitude. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"The pergannah of Phak abounds with odoriferous plants. Adjoining to it is a large lake named Dull, one side of which is close to the town. On this lake are artificial islands made for the purpose of cultivation, and sometimes robbers will cut off...\"\npieces of these floating islands, and convey them to another part of the lake.\"\n\n---\n\n**PHILIPPINE ISLES.**\n\nThe Philippine Isles extend from the fifth to the 26th degrees of north latitude, and comprehend a great number of islands, many of which are as yet but little known. The largest island is Luzon, or Luconia; to the south of which the principal islands are Mindoro, Panay, Marindique, Negros, Masbate, Zebu, Bohol, Leyte, Samar, and Magindanao; besides which there are many smaller ones, the aggregate of the whole being denominated Bisayas, or Islas de Pintados, or Painted Islands: the inhabitants having been accustomed to paint their bodies before the arrival of the Spaniards. All these islands are nominally subordinate to the Spanish government at Manilla; some of them are partially colonized, and pay tribute, collected by the Corrigidores, or Alcaldes Mayores, of the provinces into which they are subdivided; but others, such as Magindanao, are not only independent of, but carry on perpetual warfare against, the Spanish establishments in the Philippines. This appellation was given them by Ruy Lopes de Villabolas, in compliment to Philip II. of Spain, at that time Prince of the Asturias. They were first named the Western Isles, or the Archipelago of St. Lazarus, which designation was bestowed by Magellan when he discovered them.\n\nThe Philippines being situated within the tropics, the sun twice passes the zenith, and exhales the moisture, which afterwards descends in copious showers. This rainy season generally lasts from May until September, sometimes so late as the beginning of December, from which latter period, until the succeeding May, there is a perpetual spring. The regular winds are the north, the east, and the S. W. each of which prevail from three to four months; the change of wind being attended with violent storms of thunder, lightning, and, at times, whirlwinds. Some of these storms rise to the violence of hurricanes, blowing from every point of the compass within 24 hours, tearing up trees by the roots, and laying waste the country. Notwithstanding their tropical latitude the heat of the Philippines is far from being intense; and, as a general spring continues for a great part of the year, if the atmosphere were less moist, the climate would be unobjectionable. To this moisture, however, must be attributed the great luxuriance of the country, the trees being constantly covered with leaves, and the soil with vegetation, which renders it a difficult task to keep the cultivated lands clear of weeds and insects.\n\nThe Philippine Islands from their extent, their climate, and the fertility of their soil, are capable of producing all colonial commodities; and their situation is most advantageous for the commerce of India, China, and America. Rice is their principal production, and the chief food of the natives, who appear to have cultivated it in large quantities before the arrival of the Spaniards. The other products are different sorts of pulse, such as mongos, patani, kidney beans, and millet. Under the same roof with themselves the inhabitants rear pigs, fowls, ducks, goats, and buffaloes. In the mountains are many deer, and the woods and fields swarm with all sorts of pigeons, small birds, quails, a species of partridge, woodcocks, &c. The sea abounds with an infinite variety of fish, which may be caught either with the hook or with nets.\n\nThe native Bisayans take great delight in fishing, as it is a pursuit that indulges their indolence, and gratifies their appetite for fish, which they prefer to flesh meat. There are many other vegetable productions made use of besides those above-\nnamed. The pith of the palm, the young shoots of the sugar cane, green withes, and other succulents, serve as food to those who have an aversion to work to procure better. The natives cultivate the bread fruit, beans, the cacavata, &c., and they take great care of the palm tree, as from it they procure both a spirit and an oil, together with a species of sweetmeat, named by them chamaaca. The fruit trees are few in number, and of an indifferent quality, except the plantain, to which may be added the orange and mango. The areca, or betel nut, is also cultivated under the name of itno, and used profusely both by Spaniards and natives.\n\nIn the interior of the Philippines there are mines of gold and iron, but they are little attended to; gold is also procured by washing the sand which flows in small streams from the mountains. The gold mines at Paracale are worked, but so indolently as scarcely to defray the charges. In the mountains there is excellent timber both for ship and house building, and the bamboos are very long, some of them being as thick as a man's thigh. Of these the natives construct their houses, covering them with palm leaves. A little cotton is also raised for clothing, and dyed with indigo, log wood, and the seed of the achiste tree. Wax, wild honey, amber, marble, tar, brimstone, and many other lesser objects, may also be named among the commercial articles of these islands.\n\nTo their indigenous productions the Spaniards have added horses and horned cattle, which have multiplied so much that they run wild among the mountains, without being claimed by any owner. From this fact we may conjecture that there are no tigers, or any of the stronger carnivorous animals. The Spaniards also introduced sheep, geese, grapes, figs, wheat, pepper, coffee, cocoa, sugar, tobacco, and various sorts of plants, which have thriven remarkably well.\n\nAmong the curious birds found here are the swallows, which form the edible nests so highly esteemed by the Chinese; and the biche de mar, another Chinese delicacy, is also procured on the sea coast. On the shores there are a great variety of shells, and among the rest are cowries and the enormous Kima cockle, some of which will hold a gallon, and are used for vessels of holy water in the churches.\n\nNotwithstanding the fertility of these islands, they continue in a very desolate state, when it is considered that they have been colonized for nearly three centuries. The obstacles to improvement are, the sloth of the Indians; and, it may be added, of the Spaniards\u2014the hurricanes which sweep away and destroy the plantations, and the destruction caused by insects, rats, and other vermin, with which the country teems. Toleration in respect to religion, and a few privileges granted to the Chinese, would soon attract many thousands of that industrious nation, who would change the face of the country\u2014but this liberal policy is wholly repugnant to the Spanish notions of propriety.\n\nThe native Indians carry on among themselves a barter for the different productions of their country, in which gold is the representation of value and medium of exchange. They carry on likewise a small trade with the Chinese and Malays of Borneo for flag-stones, copper, and articles of furniture; but their wants being few, the quantity required is insignificant. With respect to clothing, they go almost naked; their rice they cook in a joint of green bamboo, and eat it off a leaf of the plantain tree.\n\nThe early Spanish navigators, who visited the Philippines, framed extraordinary narratives regarding the original inhabitants, whom they divided into three classes; satyrs, men with tails, and sea monsters. It is probable they found only two\u2014the various tribes of Bisayan Indians, and the strange race of oriental negroes, who still occupy the Papuan\nIsles; the latter roamed the mountains almost in a state of nature, merely covering the fore part of the body with the bark of a tree, subsisting on roots and such animals as they could kill with the bow and arrow. They slept wherever they happened to be benighted, and approached, in their manners and habits, extremely near to the beasts of the forest. The Spaniards have at last succeeded in domesticating and converting some of them to Christianity, in which they acquiesce so long as they can get food without labour; but if they are compelled to work for their subsistence they fly again to the mountains.\n\nThe Spaniards are of opinion that these negroes are the original inhabitants of the Philippines, and that the Bisayan Indians were foreign intruders, who never could entirely subdue the interior. At present the Papuas are few, and their power limited; but their hatred to the Bisayans flourishes in all its pristine perfection. When the latter kill a negro, it is customary for another to bind himself to his countrymen by oath, that he will disappear, and will not return among them until he has killed three or four Bisayans. To carry this purpose into execution he watches the Bisayan villages and the passes of the mountains, and if any unfortunately stray within his reach he murders them.\n\nBesides the Tagala nation, which is principally found in the island of Luzon, there are several other races who inhabit these islands, who differ considerably from each other in features, language, and the various relations of the social state. Such are the Pampangos, who reside to the north of Manila, and the painted races, termed by the Spaniards Pintados, who are by some reckoned a branch of the Bisayan tribe, and related to the Tagala and Burgess races, while by others they are supposed to be of the same origin as the Igorotors.\n\nThe Indians whom the Spaniards found in the Philippines were of regular stature, an olive complexion, with flat noses, large eyes, and long hair. They all possessed some description of government, and each tribe was distinguished by a distinct name; but from the similarity of their dress and manners they, probably, had all the same origin.\n\nThe chiefs are described as acquiring their dominion both by hereditary descent and by personal valour, but their authority rarely extended over more than one or two villages, and between neighbouring villages an everlasting warfare subsisted. The prisoners on each side were condemned to slavery, out of which arose three classes of people; the chief's or masters, the slaves, and those whom the chief had enfranchised with their descendants, who are at this day termed Timavas, which properly signifies children of liberty. In some places Indians were discovered whiter than others, the progeny probably of Chinese or Japanese, who had been wrecked on these coasts, and who had intermarried with the Indians; in particular the tribe Igorotes, or Ilocos, whose eyes have a Chinese shape.\n\nAmong the Bisayans there is no written law, suits being decided by the tradition of old customs, or more frequently by the will of the strongest. The rajah, or chief, with the assistance of some of the elders, regulates civil affairs; but in criminal cases the relations are accustomed to compound with the aggressor for a sum in gold, unless in cases of murder, when the law of retaliation is sanctioned. If the perpetrator happen to be of a different village, or tribe, all the community of which the deceased was a member make it a common cause, and numbers are, in consequence, killed and made slaves on both sides. A person suspected of theft is obliged to undergo the ordeal of drawing a stone from the bottom of a cauldron of boiling water, and if he fails is fined a certain quantity of gold, the greater\npart of which goes to the rajah or chief. Adultery is also punished by a pecuniary fine, as is also disrespect to the elders; but for fraud, or usury, there is no infliction whatever.\n\nIn conformity to their customs they are permitted to have only one wife, but the principal persons have several concubines, who are usually slaves. As among certain tribes in Sumatra, the bridegroom in the Philippines purchases his bride, and frequently by a previous service of several years. During this probation it is incumbent on all the relations of the suitor to behave respectfully to the bride and her relations, as if any insult be offered the marriage is annulled, which is always agreeable to the parents of the female, as by that event they are enabled to dispose of her a second time. The bridegroom, to console himself for his sufferings, as soon as his term of service ends, treats his wife as a slave. On her devolves all the laborious work for the maintenance of the family, which, when concluded, is rewarded by a beating from the husband, who lives in idleness.\n\nThe interest which the parents thus have in the disposal of their female children dooms them to a life of misery, and is in the highest degree repugnant to humanity and good morals. The Spaniards endeavoured to effect its abolition, both by royal edicts, and by the influence of the clergy; but such is the adhesion of custom among barbarians, as yet without success. The marriage ceremony is performed by the immolation of a hog, which, with many grimaces, is slain by a priestess. After this she bestows benedictions, and an old woman having presented the company with some food, the ceremony is concluded with dancing, drinking, feasting, and many obscenities.\n\nThe missionaries complain, that even the Indian converts persuade the others not to be baptized, that they may escape tribute and imposts, which are, notwithstanding, very moderate. The custom of one tribe revenging the murder of an individual on the whole tribe of the criminal, likewise very much impedes conversion and civilization; for from this results a necessity to the weakest tribes of changing their residence, or forming a confederacy with others. In such cases the baptized Indians must follow those who are not converted, and remove to a distance from the missionaries; besides which, they are exposed to constant hostilities from their pagan associates.\n\nThe Ta-gala, or the Gala language, is among the Philippines what the Malayu is in the Malay Islands, or the Hindostani in Hindostan Proper. There are six dialects in the Island of Luzon, and two in Atton. Some of these are current in several islands, but the most general are the Tagala and Bisaya; the last of which is very gross and barbarous, but the other more refined and polished, and it has been cultivated by the Spanish missionaries. The alphabet consists of 17 letters, three of which are vowels and 14 consonants. The Tagala characters are still used in Comintan, and in general among the Tagalas, who have embraced Christianity. The idioms of this language are rendered so complex by a variety of artifices, that it becomes quite impossible for a person who understands all the original words of a sentence, either to recognize them individually, or comprehend the meaning of the whole.\n\nThe ancient religious traditions of the Tagala race, their genealogies, and the feats of their gods and heroes, are carefully preserved in historical poems and songs; from which, in general, the whole substance of eastern history must be gleaned. These original memorials of the race, the Spanish missionaries have with pious care endeavoured to extirpate, and have employed themselves sedulously in composing religious\ntracts, both in prose and verse, in the Tagala language, with the hope of supplanting the remains of national and pagan antiquity. Many psalms and hymns, and even some of the Greek dramas composed by Dionysius Areopagita, have in this manner been translated into the Tagala language.\n\nThe other dialects of the different tribes of the Philippines are many and various, so that the inhabitants of one province are not intelligible to those of another; yet, notwithstanding this complexity, it appears from their construction, that they are all derivatives from one parent language. The prepositions and pronouns are said to be nearly the same in all of them; the numerical characters to differ but little, and they have many words in common, of exactly the same structure.\n\nIn their religious ceremonies the Bisayans use neither idols nor temples, their sacrifices being offered in arbours which they raise for that purpose; nor have they any external address of adoration to their gods. They have priestesses, whom they term babailonas, or catalonas, to whom the function belongs of performing the sacrifice. Taking a lance in her hands, with extravagant gestures she works herself up to a frenzy, muttering unintelligible words, which are received as prophetic\u2014she then pierces a hog with a lance; and, having distributed the carcase among the bystanders, the ceremony is closed with dancing and drinking. These sacrifices are offered alike to evil spirits and to the manes of their ancestors; the latter of whom they are taught to believe inhabit very large trees, rocks of a fantastic appearance, or any other natural object, varying in respect to magnitude or formation from the usual course. Of this their conviction is so strong, that they never pass objects of this description without asking leave of their imaginary inhabitants. They have many other superstitions, one of which is the Patianac. This is a spirit or ideal being, whose employment and amusement consists in presenting, by a method peculiar to itself, the delivery of a woman in labour. To counteract the malignity of this demon, the husband, having made fast the door, strips off his clothes, lights a fire, and arming himself with a sword, flourishes it furiously about until the woman is delivered. The Tigbalang is another object of their apprehension, and is described as a phantom which assumes a variety of uncouth and monstrous shapes, and interposes its authority to prevent the converted Indians from performing the duties of religion.\n\nThese and other superstitions formerly had an extensive influence, and are still extolled by impostors, who find their account in recommending such absurdities as panaceas for illness and misfortune. Such also is the imbecility of Indians, that although they believe these customs are sinful, and by no means give entire credit to their efficacy, yet they practise them, thinking chance may effect something in their favour. The Spanish missionaries have also found them but superficial Christians, and more influenced by a dread of power, than by any religious impressions, or rational piety. Their manners and religious notions correspond, in many particulars, with those of the inland Sumatans.\n\nThe Bisayan Indians do not believe there is any future state of reward or punishment; but they acknowledge the immortality of the soul, and express an apprehension of mischief from the spirits of the deceased, who they suppose retain all the wants incident to them while on earth. For this reason they place on the tomb clothes, arms, and food; and, on the fourth day, when the funeral ceremony is performed, a vacant seat is left at the table for the deceased, whom they believe to be actually present, although not perceptible. To verify this fact,\nsand is strewed on the floor, on which the prints of the feet of the defunct are asserted to be seen; and, in order to deprecate his supposed wrath, catables are offered to him\u2014fear and superstition forming the basis of the Bisayan character.\n\nMagellan, whose ship first circumnavigated the globe, on the day of St. Lazarus, in A.D. 1521, discovered a great many islands which he named the Archipelago of St. Lazarus; and on Easter-day he arrived at the Island of Magindanao. Several voyages were subsequently undertaken by the Spaniards, for the purpose of taking possession of these islands; but nothing was effected until 1564, when, in consequence of orders from Philip II. of Spain, a fleet was dispatched from Mexico under Miguel Lopez de Legaspi, which arrived at the Philippines in February, 1565, and first stopped at Zebu, which was soon wholly subdued.\n\nIn 1570, a fleet sailed from the Island of Panay for Luzon, when, after several engagements with the rajahs of the country, who appear to have been principally Malays, they effected a settlement at the mouth of the Manilla River. In 1571, Legaspi in person sailed to Luzon, and entering the river on the 10th of May, took possession of the town of Manilla, which he constituted the capital of the Spanish possessions in the Philippines. He afterwards sent detachments to different parts of the island, accompanied by friars, without whose assistance little progress would have been made in the reduction of the island. Different establishments were in consequence fixed on the seacoast; but to the last the interior has never been either subdued or explored. In 1572, several Chinese junks arrived with merchandize, and many of that nation settled on the Island of Luzon, much against the inclination of the Spaniards, who repeatedly expelled them; and in this year Legaspi, the first viceroy of the Philippines, died.\n\nIn 1574, the existence of the colony was endangered by an attack from Limahon, a great Chinese pirate, who arrived with 62 junks; but after many bloody engagements he was expelled, and great part of his army destroyed. Towards the conclusion of the 16th century, a considerable and open trade was carried on with Japan; the natives of which, very different from those at present, navigated all over the Eastern Seas, and brought cargoes of the richest merchandize to Manilla, both for the consumption of the settlement and for the export trade to Acapulco. The Japanese Emperor, Tayosuma, even wished to be acknowledged King of Manilla, but without success. Through the medium of this commerce several friars were introduced into Japan, for the propagation of the Roman Catholic religion. At the same period the King of Cambodia sent the governor of the Philippines a present of two elephants, and solicited his assistance against the King of Siam. In 1596 commerce flourished, and an intercourse subsisted with China, Java, the Coast of Coromandel, and Mexico.\n\nIn 1590, the Spaniards attacked the Island of Sooleo, named by them Jolo, but were repulsed with great slaughter; nor could they even make any impression on the Sooloo pirates, who have for nearly three centuries been the scourge of the Philippines, and still continue so. When the Dutch established themselves in India, a war commenced between them and the Spaniards, which lasted nearly half a century. By the year A.D. 1639, the number of Chinese on these islands had increased to 30,000, most of them settled as cultivators in Calamba and Binan. The Spaniards appear always to have been jealous of them, and hostile to their residence, although the most industrious of their subjects. In 1639, in consequence of\nsome disaffection, real or imaginary, the Spaniards commenced a war against them, and made so dreadful a havoc, that in a short time they were reduced to 7000, who surrendered at discretion. During this disturbance the native Indians remained neutral, having a greater hatred to the Chinese, than even that which possessed them against the Spaniards. In 1662 Manilla was threatened with an invasion from Coxinga, a great Chinese pirate, who had subdued Formosa, and expelled the Dutch; but it was never carried into effect.\n\nA.D. 1757, the viceroy of the Philippines dispatched all the Chinese to their own country; and, in order to prevent their future establishment in the Archipelago, he appropriated the quarter of St. Fernando for the reception of such Chinese as should come on commercial pursuits, and made regulations for their re-embarkation in good time, with the exception of such as had been converted to the Christian religion, who were permitted to remain and apply themselves to the cultivation of the land.\n\nIn 1762 Manilla was attacked by a British fleet and army under Admiral Cornish and General Draper, which arrived on the 22d of September; and, after a short siege, stormed the walls on the 5th of October. The archbishop, who acted as governor, was admitted to a capitulation on the 6th of October, when, to prevent a general plunder of the city, he agreed to pay the conquerors four millions of dollars in different ways; but of this little more than half a million was ever received. By the terms of the capitulation the whole of the islands were surrendered; but in the remote provinces the Spaniards maintained their independence, and the British force was scarcely sufficient to garrison the town, far less to subdue the country. Skirmishes and small actions continued to occur between the Spaniards and the British, in which the latter were joined by the Chinese settlers. In many districts the Indians rose on the Spaniards, and great confusion prevailed until the 23d July, 1763, when an English frigate arrived with the armistice; but Manilla was not conclusively delivered up until March, 1764.\n\nSince that period the Spanish colonies in these fruitful islands have not been disturbed by any European enemies, although frequently threatened with invasion from the British settlements in India. Besides Manilla, and the larger establishments on Luzon, they have many smaller settlements scattered over the islands to the south; but such is the weakness of the Spanish government, that they have never been able to protect them against the attacks of a few despicable pirate vessels. For two centuries past the piratical cruisers from Magindanao and Sooloo have been plundering the coast of the Philippines, capturing vessels, pillaging villages, burning towns, massacring some of the inhabitants, and carrying others into slavery; in which unfortunate list are included a very great number of the clergy, both Spaniards and Indians. Although unable to defend them, such is the jealousy of the Spaniards, that they do not allow the natives to possess arms, iron of every sort being a royal monopoly. It is asserted also that the alcades purchase from the pirates the very slaves they have captured on their own islands, which saves them the trouble of carrying them away for sale. In Feb. 1809, the Spanish government of the Philippines published a declaration of their adherence to Ferdinand VII. and opened their ports to the British; since which time a brisk trade has subsisted, although considerably injured by the revolutionary warfare in Mexico. (Zuniga, Sonnerat, Leyden, Marsden, Peyrouse, Forrest, &c.)\n\nPHUGWANNA.\u2014A town in the province of Lahore, situated in the doab of the Sutuleje and Beyah rivers S. E. from Jallinder. This is a\nlarge walled town, situated in a fertile country, producing wheat, gram, mote, mough, oord, and sugar-cane. In the neighbourhood coarse cloths of various sorts are manufactured. (11th Register, &c.)\n\nPillibet.\u2014A town in the province of Delhi, district of Bareily, 33 miles N. E. from Bareily. Lat. 28\u00b0. 39'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 45'. E. During the Rohillah government this place was an emporium of commerce, and was greatly augmented by Hafez Rehmat, who built a spacious pettah four miles in circumference. Its staples are saul, sissoo, and fir timbers, sugars, and coarse cloths; and from the mountains of Almora are imported borax, pitch, drugs, wax, and honey. After its acquisition by the Nabob of Oude its commerce was annihilated; but, since its cession to the British, has greatly revived. (Franklin, &c.)\n\nPillere.\u2014A small town in the district of Gurrumeundah, 95 miles W. N. W. from Madras. Lat. 13\u00b0. 32'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 5'. E.\n\nPinagra.\u2014A town in the Barra-mahal Province, 95 miles E. by S. from Seringapatam. Lat. 12\u00b0. 6'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 8'. N.\n\nPindaruk, (or Pintara).\u2014A small village in the Gujrat Peninsula, situated on a sandy plain, extending about two miles from the sea-shore, near the south-western extremity of the peninsula.\n\nIn the vicinity is a spring of pink-coloured water, celebrated among the natives as a place of pilgrimage. This spring gives its name to the village, which is inhabited only by a few religious persons, who subsist on the bounty of the numerous pilgrims. As this village lies in the direct road to Dwaraca, persons resorting to that fane take the opportunity of bathing in the pink-coloured stream, and thereby purifying themselves. The spring is within high water mark; by which circumstance it is kept constantly clean. The adjacent lands along the coast are much impregnated with iron, which may account for the colour and mineral qualities of the spring. In the neighbourhood are many large tanks. The village belongs to the Jam of Noanagur. (Macnurdo, &c.)\n\nPindar River.\u2014A small river in Northern Hindostan, in the province of Serinagur, which afterwards joins the Alacauanda, forming the sacred confluence of Cannaprayaga.\n\nPipley, (Pipali).\u2014A small town in the province of Orissa, district of Mohurbunge, situated on the Subnrecka River, 22 miles N. E. from Balasore. Lat. 21\u00b0. 42'. N. Long. 87\u00b0. 25'. E.\n\nAbout the middle of the 17th century this was a great resort of European trade, from whence the Dutch shipped annually 2000 tons of salt. The first permission obtained by the English from the Mogul emperors to trade with Bengal was restricted to this place, now almost unknown. Since that period, the floods having washed away great part of the town, and formed a dangerous bar in the river, the merchants have removed to Balasore.\n\nPiply.\u2014A town in the province of Orissa, district of Cuttack, 30 miles south from the town of Cuttack. Lat. 20\u00b0. 8'. N. Long. 86\u00b0. 5'. E.\n\nPiploody, (Pippalavati).\u2014A town and large mud fort in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Khan-desh. 31 miles N. E. from Boorhanpoor.

Long. 71\u00b0. 48'. E.\n\nPitt's Straits.\u2014The straits which separate the islands of Salwatty and Battanta, situated at the western extremity of Papua, or New Guinea. In length they are about 30 miles, by six the mean width.\n\nPlassey, (Palasi).\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Nuddea, 30 miles south from Moorshedabad. Lat. 23\u00b0. 45'. N. Long. 88\u00b0. 15'. E.\nThe battle of Plassey, which decided the fate of Bengal, and ultimately of India, was fought on the 23rd June, 1757. The British forces, under Colonel Clive, consisted of 900 Europeans, 100 topasses, and 2000 sepoys, with eight six-pounders, and two howitzers. The nabob's army, if such a rabble deserve the name, was estimated at 50,000 foot, and 50 pieces of cannon, besides about 40 Frenchmen, fugitives from Chander-nagore.\n\n**Poggy (or Nassau) Isles, (Pulo Paggi).**\u2014The Poggy or Nassau islands form part of a chain, which lie off the whole length of the west coast of Sumatra, at the distance of 20 or 30 leagues. The north extremity of the Northern Poggy is situated in Lat. 2\u00b0. 18'. S. and the southern extremity of the most southern island in Lat. 3\u00b0. 16'. S. The two are separated from each other by a very narrow passage called See Cockup, in Lat. 2\u00b0. 40'. S. and Long. 100\u00b0. 35'. E. which affords very safe anchorage for ships.\n\nThe face of the country is rough and irregular, consisting of high and precipitous mountains, covered with trees to their summits, among which are the species called puhn, fit for the largest masts. The woods in their present state are quite imperious. The sago tree grows here in plenty, and is the chief food of the inhabitants, who do not cultivate rice. The cocoa nut tree and the bamboo, and also a great variety of fruits, such as mangosteens, pine-apples, plantains, &c. are found here. The wild animals are the large red deer, hogs, and several kinds of monkeys; but there are neither buffaloes, goats, nor tigers. Fish are procured in great plenty, and with pork constitute the favourite food of the natives. The shell of the nautilus is often driven on shore empty, but the natives say, they have never yet caught the nautilus fish alive in the shell.\n\nNotwithstanding the proximity of these islands to Sumatra, the inhabitants and their language have no resemblance whatever to the Sumatrans, but a very strong one to the natives of the South Sea Islands. Near the entrance of the Straits of See Cockup (Si Kakap) on the Northern Island, are a few houses inhabited by Malays from Fort Marlborough, who reside here for the purpose of building large boats, on account of the plenty of timber. The natives are but few, divided into small tribes, each tribe occupying a small river, and living in one village. On the Northern Poggy are seven villages, and on the Southern five; the aggregate number of inhabitants not exceeding 1400, the interior being uninhabited.\n\nTheir clothing consists of a piece of coarse cloth made of the bark of a tree. Their stature is generally under five feet and a half; their complexion a light brown, or copper colour, like the Malays. The use of betel is unknown among them, but the custom of tattooing the skin universal. They have no metals except such as they procure from Sumatra. The greatest length of their war canoes is 65 feet; breadth five feet; depth three feet and a half; and their weapons bows and arrows.\n\nThe natives of these islands do not appear to have any form of religious worship, and do not practise circumcision. When asked from whence they originally came, they reply, from the sun. Murder is punishable among them by retaliation. In cases of adultery the injured husband has a right to seize the effects of the paramour; and sometimes he punishes his wife by cutting off her hair. The customs they follow in their mode of disposing of their dead resemble those of the Otaheitans.\n\nIn 1783, the son of a rajah of one of these islands came over to Sumatra, on a visit of curiosity, and seemed to be an intelligent man. He appeared acquainted with several of the constellations, and gave names of the Pleiades, Scorpion, Great Bear, and Orion's Belt; and\nunderstood the distinction betwixt fixed and wandering stars. He particularly noticed Venus, which he named the planet of the evening. Sumatra he named Seraihu, and said, that as to religion, the rajahs alone prayed, and sacrificed hogs and fowls. In the first instance they address themselves to the Power above the sky; next to those in the moon, who are male and female; and lastly, to that evil being, whose residence is below the earth, and is the cause of earthquakes.\n\nThe dialects of Neas and the Poggy Isles, the inhabitants of the latter of which are termed Mantaway by the Malays, have probably greater pretensions to originality than any of the dialects of Sumatra, but resemble the Batta more than any other language.

Lat. 6\u00b0. N. Long. 80\u00b0. 15'. E.**\n\nThe harbour is spacious, particularly the outer road. The inner harbour is secure during a great part of the year; but winds from a particular quarter are requisite to carry vessels out. Ships outward-bound from Europe generally come in sight of the first land at Dondrahend, the southern promontory of Ceylon, and make Point de Galle the first harbour. There is no regular rainy season here, but from its situation at the extremity of the island it has a share of the rain of each coast, which falls in occasional storms at every season of the year. More rain, however, falls between November and February than at any other time.\n\nPoint de Galle is an old Dutch fort, very much out of repair. Not above six English families reside here constantly; but occasionally, when the homeward-bound fleet is assembled here, a much greater number is collected. The pettah, or native town, is extensive, and the houses superior to those at Trincomalee; in respect to trade it ranks next to Columbo. Fisheries to a considerable extent are carried on here, and the fish dried and cured for exportation to the Continent of India. Arrack, oil, pepper, cotton, and cardamums, also form a part of its exports. Cinnamon is also grown here, but not in such quantities as about Columbo; in flavour it is much the same. One of the East India ships touches here annually, to carry off what cinnamon is prepared for exportation.\n\nNear the fort a colony of Chinese is established by government as gardeners, for the purpose of raising vegetables, in which their patience has at last succeeded, after that of Europeans had failed. They cultivate excellent vegetables of various sorts, and have also thriving plantations of sugar-cane. The mutton here is indifferent; but the beef, poultry, bread, and fish, are excellent. The travelling distance from Columbo, in a palanquin, is 72 miles.\n\nAt Bellegam, about 20 miles S.E. from Point de Galle, is a celebrated Buddhist temple, in which is a figure of Buddha recumbent. In a corner is another figure, seated on a cobra capella snake coiled up, the hood of which forms a canopy over his head. There is also a gigantic four-handed figure of Vishnu, of a dark blue colour, and the walls within are covered with painted figures of Buddha. About two miles from the temple of Bellegam there is a large fragment of a rock, on which is sculptured a figure 12 feet high, called by the country people the Cotta Rajah. The Portuguese obtained possession of Point de Galle\nso early as 1517. (Percival, M. Graham, Lord Valenta, Bruce, &c.)\n\nPoint Pedro.\u2014The northern extremity of the Island of Ceylon. Lat. 9\u00b0. 52'. N. Long. 80\u00b0. 25'. E. The passage from Negapatam, in the province of Tanjore, to Point Pedro, is made usually in a few hours.

E.\n\nPolo.\u2014A small island, one of the Philippines, situated off the west coast of Luzon, or Laconia, about the 15th degree of north latitude. In length it may be estimated at 25 miles, by three the average breadth.\n\nPoloonshah.\u2014A town and district tributary to the Nizam, in the province of Hyderabad, 70 miles N.W. from Rajahmundry. Lat. 17\u00b0. 35'. N. Long. 81\u00b0. 10'. E.\n\nThis place is situated in a rich and luxuriant valley, about four miles wide. The fort is a square of about 300 yards, and has a large round tower at each angle. The rampart is faced with masonry, and is surrounded by a deep dry ditch. It is well covered by a glacis, and may be considered as a place of some strength. The town is above two miles in circumference, and is very populous, but consists of poor Telanghut huts. The valley is surrounded on all sides by lofty ranges of mountains, the passes through which are the only accesses to Poloonshah. There is here a manufactory of matchlocks, jinjalls, spears, sabres, and other weapons, and the rajah has a train of six brass field pieces. (Blunt, &c.)\n\nPolygar's Territory.\u2014A district in the Southern Carnatic, situated principally between the 10th and 11th degrees of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by Trichinopoly; on the south by Marawas and Madura; on the east it has Tanjore and the sea; and on the west Dindigul. Although this country has acquired the distinctive appellation of the Polygar Territory, the name is not peculiar to it, being common to every native chief throughout the south of India.\n\nThe polygars are military chieftains of different degrees of power and consequence, who bear a strong affinity to the zemindars of the Northrn Circars. Those whose polams, or estates, are situated in the frontier and jungly part of the country, are represented to have been for the most part leaders of banditti, or freebooters, who, as is not uncommon in Asia, had afterwards been entrusted with the police of the country. Some of them trace their descent from the ancient rajas, or from those who held high offices of trust under the Hindu government, and received allowances in land or money for the support of a body of horse and foot on the feudal principle.\n\nOther polygars had been renters of districts, or revenue officers, who had revolted in times of public disturbance, and usurped the possession of lands, to which they were constantly adding by successive encroachments, when the ruling power happened to be weak and inefficient. The heads of villages, when favoured by the natural strength of the country, frequently assumed the name and character of polygars, and kept up their military retainers and nominal officers of state, exercising in this contracted sphere many of the essential powers of sovereignty.\n\nThe amount of the tribute which they paid to the Soubahdars of the Carnatic was wholly disproportioned to their revenues; but more was constantly extorted by the officers of government under the names of fines and presents, which was a perpetual source of violence and distraction. During the periods of public calamity, they retaliated upon the nabob's officers and the peaceable inhabitants of the government villages, those acts of indefinite and oppressive authority, which were committed\non themselves. Hence the British government were repeatedly burdened with large armaments to subdue these feudatories, involving heavy disbursements from the public revenue, and severe loss of lives.\n\nThe principal pollans, or polygar estates, are those of Shevagunga, Rannad, Manapara, Madura, and Nattam. The two first were permanently assessed in 1803, at the same time as those of Tinevelly; and the rest were soon afterwards settled in perpetuity. From this period the tribute of the polygars, although increased, has been punctually paid; no blood has been shed, or money expended in military operations against them, and the surrounding districts have enjoyed tranquillity under the revival of the ancient system of village police.\n\nThis territory is not so well watered, or in so high a state of cultivation, as the adjacent province of Tanjore; but the soil is naturally very fertile, and the agriculture, from the steadiness of government, progressively improving. There are no rivers of any considerable magnitude; the chief towns are, Nattam, Manapar, Vcranall, Puducott, Cottapatau, and Tondi. The district is now comprehended in the collectorship of Dindigul. (5th Report, Lord Valentia, &c.)\n\nPONARUM.\u2014A town in the Carnatic, 55 miles S.W. from Pondicherry. Lat. 11\u00b0. 26'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 20'. E.\n\nPONDICHERY, (Puducheri).\u2014A city on the sea-coast of the Carnatic, once the most splendid European settlement in India, but now greatly reduced. Lat. 11\u00b0. 56'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 58'. E.\n\nThis place stands on a sandy plain not far from the sea-shore, producing only palm trees, millet, and few herbs; but the surrounding district produces cotton and a little rice. Upon the whole, however, it is better situated than Madras, as during the S.W. monsoon, which is the season of naval warfare, it is to windward, an advantage the French experienced the benefit of during the hard-contested wars of last century.\n\nPondicherry has no natural advantages as a commercial town, and when it ceased to be the capital of the French possessions, it soon fell to decay. On account of the long continuance of the late war, the French inhabitants were reduced to the utmost distress; and being unable, from poverty, to repair their houses, the appearance of the town has suffered very much\u2014and for the destruction of its fortifications, it is indebted to the policy of its own government.\n\nIn 1758 the French government, confiding in the great force sent out under M. Lally, ordered him to destroy and dismantle all the British fortifications that might fall into his power, which he executed practically when he captured Fort St. David. A heavy retribution followed when Pondicherry was taken by Colonel Coote, in 1761. On this occasion the fortifications were levelled, and the ditch filled up by the removal of the glacis into it, and from this destruction it has never completely recovered.\n\nThe French power in India was but of short duration, but remarkably brilliant while it lasted. It commenced under the government of M. Dupleix in 1749, and was extinguished by the surrender of Pondicherry in 1761; but the beginning of the colony has a much earlier date.\n\nThe French first adventured to India in 1601, when two ships were fitted out from St. Malo\u00ebs, under the command of the Sieur Bardalieu, which were wrecked next year among the Maldives Isles without reaching their destination. In 1604 Henry IV. incorporated the first French East India Company with a charter for 15 years. In 1672 the French, under M. Martin, purchased from the King of Visiapoor (Beja-poor) a village on the coast called Pondicherry, with a small tract ad-\njacent, where he effected a settlement, which soon became populous, from the distracted state of the neighbouring countries. In 1693 the Dutch took Pondicherry, which they retained until the peace of Ryswick, in 1697, when they were obliged to restore it with the fortifications greatly improved.\n\nOn the 26th August, 1748, Admiral Boscowen besieged Pondicherry with an army composed of 3720 Europeans, 300 topasses, and 2000 sepoys; and, on the 6th October, was compelled to raise the siege, having lost in the course of it 1065 Europeans. The French garrison consisted of 1800 Europeans and 3000 sepoys. M. Dupleix acted as governor during this siege, having been appointed in 1742; in 1754 he was removed from the government. M. Lally landed at this settlement on the 28th Feb. 1758, when an active war ensued between the French and British forces, which ended in the total ruin of the French and their adherents. Pondicherry surrendered to the British army under Colonel Coote on the 16th Jan. 1761, after a long and strict blockade. The total number of European military taken in the town, including services attached to the troops, was 2072; the civil inhabitants were 381; the artillery fit for service were 500 pieces of cannon, and 100 mortars and howitzers. The ammunition, arms, weapons, and military stores, were in equal abundance.\n\nAt the peace of 1763 this fortress was restored to the French East India Company, with the fortifications, in a very dilapidated condition; but, by great exertions and the skill of the French engineers, they were again considerably strengthened. In Oct. 1778 it surrendered to the army under Sir Hector Munro after an obstinate defence, highly honourable to the governor, M. de Bellecombe. The garrison consisted of 3000 men, of whom 900 were Europeans; the besieging army amounted to 10,500 men, of whom 1500 were Europeans.\n\nAt the peace of 1783 it again devolved to the French, but, on the breaking out of hostilities, surrendered to the British army on the 23rd August, 1793. On this occasion the garrison consisted of 900 soldiers, and 1500 armed inhabitants.\n\nIt was restored at the peace of Amiens, at which period the inhabitants were estimated at 25,000, the revenue at 40,000 pagodas per annum, and the extent of sea coast five miles. On this event Buonaparte seems to have formed expectations of raising it to its ancient splendour, otherwise he would not have sent out an establishment of such magnitude as arrived under General de Caen. This consisted of seven generals, a proportional number of inferior officers, and 1400 regular troops, including a body guard of 80 horse; in addition to which they brought 100,000l. in specie\u2014the whole evidently intended for a much wider field of action than the confined territory of Pondicherry afforded. Whatever were his plans they were all frustrated by the short duration of the peace, as Pondicherry was again occupied by the British in 1803; but the French admiral, Linois, having the earliest intelligence, escaped with his ships.\n\nThe system of policy adopted by the French from the beginning violated the customs and prejudices of the natives. M. Dupleix destroyed their temples; M. Lally forced them to work in the trenches, and to do other military duty repugnant to their caste; and the French government had prohibited the residence of a single family which was not Christian within its boundaries. To this intolerant and interfering spirit, in a considerable degree, must be attributed the decline of the French power, and to a contrary system the elevation of the British on its ruins.\n\nTravelling distance from Madras, 100 miles; from Serinapatanam, 260; from Hyderabad, 452; from Delhi, 1400; from Calcutta, 1130; from Nagpoor, 773; from Poonah, 707.\nPontiana.\u2014A Dutch settlement on the west coast of the Island of Borneo. Lat. 3\u00b0 S. Long. 109\u00b0 30' E.\n\nThe Dutch East India Company obtained possession of Landak and Succadana, on the Island of Borneo, by a grant from the King of Bantam, to whose crown they were appendages. In the year 1778 he ceded the entire property of them to the Dutch East India Company, which took immediate possession of them, and erected a small fort called Pontiana situated on a river then named Lava, but now by Europeans Pontiana. (Stavorinus and Notes, &c.)\n\nPoolseepoor.\u2014A town in the Nahob of Oude's territories, 46 miles N. N. E. from Fyzabad. Lat. 27\u00b0 28' N. Long. 82\u00b0 30' E.\n\nPoonah, (Puna).\u2014A city in the province of Bejapoor, the capital of the Peshwa and of the Maharatta empire. Lat. 18\u00b0 30' N. Long. 74\u00b0 E.\n\nThis place is situated about 30 miles to the east of the Ghauts, 100 road miles from Bombay, and 75 from the nearest sea-coast. Considering its rank Poonah is not large, covering probably little more than two square miles, is but indifferently built, and wholly open and defenceless; on which account it better answers the description of a large village than of a city. Several of the houses are large, and built with square blocks of granite to about 14 feet from the ground; the upper part is a frame work of timber, with slight walls. The lime, bricks, and tiles, are so bad, that the rain washes away any building that does not depend on timber for its support. The inhabitants are well supplied from extensive markets; and there is a long street in which a great variety of articles, such as mirrors, globes, lamps, &c. are displayed. The streets are named after mythological personages, adding the termination warry, equivalent to street; and the members of the Hindoo pantheon are brought still further into notice by paintings on the exterior of the houses; the history of the Brahminical deities may therefore be learned while traversing the city.\n\nThe ancient palace or castle of Poonah is surrounded by high thick walls, with four round towers, and has only one entrance, through a pointed arch. Here the Peshwa's brother and other members of the family reside, but he has a modern house for his own residence in another part of the town. In 1809 he had made arrangements for the erection of a palace, to be built by British architects, his highness defraying the expense. Preparatory to the construction of this edifice the ground was then marked out and consecrated, by being plastered over with a composition of cow dung and ashes.\n\nThe view from Parvati hill commands the town with all its gardens and plantations, the cantonments of the subsidiary force, and the British residency at the Sungum. At the bottom of the hill is a large square field enclosed with high brick walls, where the Peshwa assembles the Brahmins, to whom he gives alms at the great feast when the rainy season terminates, who, on this occasion, beg their way to Poonah from all parts of India. When all assembled they are shut in and marked, and as they come out, one at a time, the gratuity is given to them. To the eastward of the city there are mythological excavations resembling those of Carli and Elephanta, but of a very inferior description.\n\nAt this place the Moota River joins the Moola\u2014their union forming the Mootamoola, which runs into the Beemah. This river afterwards forms a junction with the Krishna; by which route, during the rainy season, a journey by water may be effected from within 75 miles distance of the western coast of India to the Bay of Bengal. The Moota washes the city on the north side, where it is about 200 yards broad,\nand in the dry season very shallow. It was formerly intended to build a bridge over it; but the Peshwa, who commenced it, dying, and his successor, while prosecuting the work, the undertaking was judged unpleasing to the gods, and abandoned. The Sungum, where the British ambassador resides, is distant about two miles from the city, having the Moota River between them, and is entirely occupied by the ambassador's suite and other British subjects. The garden is watered by both rivers by means of aqueducts, and produces Indian fruits and vegetables. Apple and peach trees thrive here, and there is also an excellent vineyard.\n\nThe present Peshwa Bajcerow is the son of the famous Ragobah (Ragoonauth Row) of evil memory. His predecessor, Madhurov, the young Peshwa, died suddenly the 27th of October, 1795, when this prince was raised to the sovereignty, but experienced many vicissitudes, having been repeatedly dethroned and reinstated by the chiefs of the contending factions. His alliance with the British, concluded at Bassein on the 30th Dec. 1802, established his power on a solid foundation, and he has ever since remained in undisturbed possession of the government. Although his family is Brahminical, yet, not being of the highest order, the purer classes of Brahmans refuse to eat with him; and at Nassuck, a place of pilgrimage, near the source of the Godavery, he was not allowed to descend by the same flight of steps used by the holy priests. The Poonah Brahmans affect an extreme purity, and abstain from animal food, and some of them object to eating carrots; but, notwithstanding their sanctified abstinence, they are held in extreme contempt by their carnivorous brethren of Bengal and Upper Hindostan.\n\nAmong the natives here beef is never killed or eaten, except by very base tribes of Hindoos. Particular towns within Maharatta territories enjoy the exclusive privilege of killing beef for sale; Koorsee, on the Krishna River, is one; and Wahi, or Wye, about 50 miles to the southward of Poonah, is another. The burning of widows with their husbands' corpse is very frequent at Poonah, where five or six instances occur every year; and the immolation is usually performed at the junction of the Moota and Moola rivers, close to the British residency.\n\nThe population of Poonah is not great for the metropolis of so extensive an empire, but it probably exceeds 100,000. Formerly at the festival of the Dusserah, on the 13th of October, the great Maharatta chiefs used to attend at Poonah, accompanied by prodigious bodies of their followers, by whom whole fields were devastated. Having celebrated this festival, they were accustomed to set out on their predatory excursions into the neighbouring countries, where little distinction was made between friend and foe\u2014a Maharatta being remarkably impartial in his robberies. On some occasions, when invaded, the Maharattas not thinking Poonah worth preserving, have destroyed it with their own hands, after sending the archives and valuables to some of the nearest hill fortresses; and, in a state that can conveniently exist without a large capital, great advantages are gained in war by a release from such an incumbrance.\n\nTravelling distance from Bombay, 98 miles; from Hyderabad, 387; from Oojain, 442; from Nagpoor, 486; from Delhi, 913; and from Calcutta, by Nagpoor, 1208 miles.

N. Long. 89\u00b0. 45'. E. This is the winter residence of the Deb Rajah, and being the warmest part of Bootan, is selected for the cultivation of exotics from the south. The palace of Poonakha resembles that of Tassisudon,\nbut is rather more spacious, and has in the same manner its citadel and gilded canopy. It is situated on a peninsula, washed on both sides by the Matchieu and Patchieu Rivers, immediately before their junction. (Turner, &c.)\n\nPoonar.\u2014A hilly and woody district belonging to the Nizam, in the province of Berar, situated between the 21st and 22nd degrees of north latitude. The chief town is Poonar, and there is no river of consequence. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Poonar, containing five mahals; revenue 13,440,000 dams.\"\n\nPoonar.\u2014A town in the Nizam's territories, in the province of Berar, the capital of a district of the same name, 75 miles south from Elllichpoor.

E.\n\nOn a high mountain in this district, visible from Bhattia, once stood the city of Goomtee, which was the metropolis of the Ranas of Poorbunder, when their sway extended throughout the western quarters of the Gujrat Peninsula. It was destroyed by Jam Bhamenec, the son of Jam Oner, who invaded the country from Siude, for the purpose of overturning the government of Poorbunder. Legendary tales and songs state their passage of the Run at Mallia, which may be esteemed evidence of the extent of that curious swamp at an early period. In this district there are several extensive works for fusing iron.\n\nBy an agreement concluded in 1808, Rana Sertanjee and Coer Halalaje of Poorbunder, engaged with the Bombay government not to permit, instigate, or connive at, any act of piracy committed by any person under their authority, and also to abstain from plundering vessels in distress. Reciprocal freedom of trade to be permitted by both parties, and an agent from the Bombay government to be allowed to reside at Poorbunder, to ascertain that the articles of the treaty were correctly observed.

The salt pans are formed by an arm of the sea, which overflows part of the country between this place and Calpenteen. A large quantity of salt was manufactured here by the Dutch, who considered their exclusive possession of this article as one of their greatest means of coercing the kings of Candy, as the latter could only procure this necessary through the medium of the Dutch.\n\nSince the British acquired Ceylon, the production of salt here has been almost entirely neglected, although it might be rendered profitable, and is most eligibly situated for supplying the King of Candy's dominions. (Percival, &c.)\n\nPopo Isle.\u2014An island in the Eastern Seas, 50 miles in circumference, and situated about the 130th degree of east longitude. The two clusters of islands named Bo and Popolo lie nearly in the same parallel of latitude, the latter being of a more mountainous surface than the former. They are inhabited, and\nafford a supply of cocoa nuts, salt, and dried fish. (Forrest, &c.)\n\nPooshkur, (or Pokur).\u2014A celebrated Hindoo place of pilgrimage, in the province of Ajmeer, situated about four miles from the city of Ajmeer. The town, which is not large, stands on the shore of a romantic lake (Pooshkor), from which it takes its name. It is said that at this place only is to be seen any sacred image of Brahma. His temple is close to the lake, small, plain, and very ancient; and the image is about the size of a man, with four faces in a sitting posture. The largest temple at this place is dedicated to the third incarnation of Vishnu, but only the ruins now remain, having been demolished by the zeal of Aurengzebe. Besides these there are many others of modern date, erected to every deity in the Hindoo calendar, and amongst others one dedicated to Maladeva, which is the handsomest at the place. The banks of the lake are covered with small temples, pavilions, and choultries, built by the neighbouring rajahs at various times.\n\nThe town of Pooshkur is divided into two quarters, containing altogether about 700 houses, the inhabitants of which are mostly Brahmins, and entirely dependent on charitable contributions for a subsistence. Here is also a Mahomedan mosque, built by Byrau Khan, the friend and tutor of the Emperor Aceber. The marble used in most of the great buildings is dug out of quarries about seven miles to the west of Pooshkur. The country extending west to the city of Meerta is flat, and but little cultivated. (Broughton, &c.)\n\nPorga.\u2014A town on the sea coast of the province of Travancor, 130 miles N. W. from Cape Comorin. Lat. 9\u00b0. 23'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 24'. E. This is a populous place, inhabited by many Mahomedan, Hindoo, and Christian merchants. The adjacent country produces abundance of rice, and may be called the granary of Malabar. The Dutch East India Company had formerly a factory here, for the purpose of procuring pepper. (Fra Paolo, &c.)\n\nPoro Isle.\u2014This island is also named Pulo Sipora, or the Island of Good Fortune, and is situated off the south-western coast of Sumatra, N. W. of the Poggy Isles, and inhabited by the same race, with the same manners and language. When this island was visited, in 1750, by Mr. John Saul, the towns or villages contained nearly 1000 inhabitants; and, in 1757, when Captain Forrest made his inquiries, there was not any material alteration. In length this island may be estimated at 33 miles, by eight the average breadth, and it is described as being almost entirely covered with wood. (Marsden, &c.)\n\nPortonovo.\u2014A town on the sea-coast of the Carnatic, 117 miles S. S. W. from Madras, and 32 miles S. by W. from Pondicherry. Lat. 11\u00b0. 30'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 52'. E.\n\nPositra.\u2014A piratical town and fortress in the western extremity of the Gujrat Peninsula, situated in the district of Oka, near to the town of that name, and in sight of Bate. Lat. 22\u00b0. 23'. N. Long. 69\u00b0. 17'. E.\n\nBy an agreement executed on the 28th Dec. 1807, Coer Meghrajee, of this place, engaged with the Bombay government not to permit, instigate, or connive at, any act of piracy committed by any person under his command, and also to abstain from plundering vessels in distress. A free commerce to be permitted to all British vessels paying the regulated duties. These precautions do not appear to have been effectual, as, in 1809, Positra surrendered to a British military force, and the walls were levelled with the ground. It had long been in the possession of a band of pirates and freebooters, who kept the adjacent territory in a state of desolation, and had baffled the utmost efforts of the neighbouring chieftains. In the neighborhood of this place there is still a village of professed pirates, who do not cultivate ground sufficient to raise the\nnecessaries of life, trusting to the success of their depredations. The gope chundun, a white clay for marking the forehead, taken from a holy tank near Positra, sells at Bombay for six rupees per maund. (Macmurd\u00f3, Treaties, &c.)\n\nPowally.\u2014A town in the province of Tinnevelly, 20 miles S.W. from Madura. Lat. 9\u00b0. 39'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 59'. E.\n\nPovanghur, (Povanghar).\u2014A strong hill fort in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Gujrat, a few miles distant from the town of Chunpaneer. Lat. 22\u00b0. 31'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 39'. E.\n\nPovanghur is an immense rock, everywhere nearly perpendicular, about 600 yards high, and inaccessible except on the north side, which is fortified with five walls. On the summit of all is a rock, on which stands a celebrated Hindoo temple, the ascent to which is by 240 steps. Notwithstanding its formidable position, it was taken, in 1803, by the British forces, after a very slight resistance. (6th Register, &c.)\n\nPratas Isles.\u2014A cluster of islands, shoals, and large reefs of considerable extent, in the Eastern Seas, being six leagues from north to south, and stretching three or four leagues to the eastward of the island. Lat. 23\u00b0. 50'. N. Long. 116\u00b0. 45'. E.\n\nPriaman.\u2014A town situated on the S.W. coast of Sumatra. Lat. 0\u00b0. 36'. S. Long. 99\u00b0. 43'. E. In 1685 this was the East India Company's chief settlement on the island, the troops embarked for the garrison amounting to 300 men, and the artillery to 49 pieces of ordnance. (Bruce, &c.)\n\nPrince of Wales' Island, (Pulo Penang, Betel-nut Island).\u2014An island situated off the west coast of the Malay Peninsula, the N.E. point of which is in Lat. 5\u00b0. 25'. N. Long. 100\u00b0. 19'. E.\n\nThis island is of an irregular four-sided figure, and computed to contain nearly 160 square miles. Throughout the centre of the island there is a range of lofty hills, decreasing in magnitude as they approach the south, and from these flow numerous fine streams, which supply the island abundantly with water. The harbour is formed by the narrow strait which separates the north side of the island from the Quedah shore. It is capacious, affords good anchorage for the largest ships, and is so well defended from the winds that a storm has never been felt here. The principal entrance is to the N.W., but there is also a fine channel to the southward. Violent squalls are occasionally experienced, but they rarely continue more than an hour.\n\nWith the exception of January and February, which are the dry hot months, the island is seldom a few day without rain; the heaviest falls about November and December. The flag staff hill, which is nearly the highest in the island, is estimated to rise 2500 feet above the level of the sea. Here the thermometer never ascends above 78\u00b0, seldom above 74\u00b0, and falls to 66\u00b0, while on the plain it ranges from 76\u00b0 to 96\u00b0. The distance of George Town from the foot of the hills is five miles, and from thence to the flag staff is three miles more.\n\nThe soil of this island is various; generally a light black mould mixed with gravel, clay, and in many parts sandy. The whole island had been for ages covered with an immense forest, from which originated a fine vegetable mould formed by the decayed leaves, which, as the woods were cleared, and the surface exposed to the weather, in a considerable degree disappeared; but the soil in the interior is still equal to any sort of cultivation. These forests produce excellent timber for ship building, and supply masts of any dimensions\u2014tower masts of one piece having been procured here for a 74 gun ship. Much of the north, and nearly the whole of the south and east sides of the island, are in a state of cultivation. The principal productions are pepper, betel nut,\nbetel leaf, cocoa nuts, coffee, sugar, paddy, ginger, yams, sweet potatoes, and a great variety of vegetables. The fruits are the mangosteen, rambusteen, pine apples, guavas, oranges, citrons, pomegranates, &c. The exotics raised here are cloves, nutmegs, cinnamon, pimento, kyapootee, colalava, and a number of other plants from the Moluccas and Eastern Isles. Pepper is the chief article of cultivation; the quantity raised in 1804 was calculated at two millions of pounds.\n\nThe elastic gum vine (urecola elastica) or American caout-chouc, is found in great plenty on Prince of Wales' Island. It is about the thickness of the arm, almost round, with a strong ash-coloured bark, much cracked and divided longitudinally, with points at small distances that send out roots, but seldom branches. It creeps along the ground to the distance of more than 200 paces, and then ascends among the branches of high trees. The milky juice of the vine is drawn off by wounding the bark, or by cutting the vine in pieces. The best is procured from the oldest vines, which will yield two-thirds of their weight of gum. The chemical properties of this vegetable milk surprisingly resemble those of animal milk.\n\nThe fort here is ill built, and incapable of defence from its size and construction; the sea has also for some time been making rapid encroachments on it. The public roads are wide, and extend many miles round the town; and there are several good bridges over the river, which were built by the Company's artificers and the Bengal convicts; the latter are likewise employed in making bricks. The markets are well supplied with fish of various kinds and of excellent quality, poultry of all sorts, pork, grain of every description, and a great profusion of fine fruits and vegetables. The beef and veal are not of a good quality; sheep are imported from Bengal and the Coast of Coromandel; goat mutton is procured from the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. Milk, bread, and butter, are very dear, and the first very scarce.\n\nAlmost all the country ships bound to the eastward, particularly those for China, touch here, where they refresh and purchase such articles of trade as they have room for. The East India Company's ships bound to China touch also here, and load large quantities of tin, canes, rattans, sago, pepper, betel nut, biche de mar, bird nests, &c., for the China market, as also to serve for Dunnage for their teas to Europe; and in this small island now centres the whole trade of the Straits of Malacca and adjacent islands.\n\n**IMPORTS**\n\nFrom Bengal.\u2014Opium, grain, iron, steel, marine stores, and piece goods. These last generally consist of hummums, gurrahs, baftaes, cossae, tanjebs, mamoodies, chintzes, kurwahs, taffetas, and bandanas.\n\nFrom the Coromandel Coast.\u2014Salt, tobacco, punjam cloths, blue cloths, coir rope and yarns, handkerchiefs, chintzes, and a small quantity of fine goods.\n\nFrom Bombay and the Malabar Coast.\u2014Cotton, salt, a few piece goods, red wood, sandal wood, shark fins, fish mote, putchuck, myrrh, Surat piece goods, oil, &c.\n\nFrom the west coast of Sumatra.\u2014Pepper, benzoin, camphire, and gold dust.\n\nFrom Acheen and Pedeer.\u2014Gold dust, betel nut, white and red, cut and chickney, pepper, rice, and Acheen cloths.\n\nFrom Diamond Point.\u2014Rattans, sago, brimstone, and gold dust.\n\nFrom the east coast.\u2014Tin, pepper, Java arrack, sugar, oil, rice, tobacco, &c., &c.\n\nFrom Junk Ceylon.\u2014Tin, bird nests, biche de mar, sepun, and elephants' teeth.\n\nFrom Tringano.\u2014Pepper and gold worked cloths.\n\nFrom Borneo.\u2014Gold dust, sago, and black wood.\nPRINCE OF WALES' ISLAND.\n\nFrom the Moluccas.\u2014Spices.\n\nFrom China\u2014Tea, sugar, lustrings, velvet, paper, umbrellas, china ware of all kinds, quicksilver, nankeens, tutenague, sweetmeats, pickles, and every article required by the Chinese settlers; raw silk, copper ware, china, camphor, china root, allum, &c.\n\nEXPORTS.\n\nTo Sumatra east and west coast.\u2014All the various piece goods imported from Bengal, the coast, and Bombay, cotton, opium, iron, and tobacco.\n\nTo Junk Ceylon.\u2014Piece goods and opium.\n\nTo Tringano, Java, Borneo, Celebes, and the Moluccas.\u2014Iron, steel, opium, Bengal piece goods, blue cloth, European coarse blue, red, and green cloths, and coarse cutlery.\n\nTo China.\u2014Opium, cotton, rattans, betel nut, pepper, bird nests, sandal wood, shark fins, Sumatra camphor, tin, biche de mar, catch, and sepun.\n\nTo Bengal and Coromandel.\u2014Pepper, tin, betel nut, cut and chickney, rattans, camphor, gold dust, &c.\n\nOf these exports a great proportion were originally imported. In 1810 the prime cost of woollens exported to Prince of Wales' Island, by the East India Company, amounted only to 445l.\n\nThe settlement here was originally established at an enormous expense, with a view of constituting it a great ship building depot and arsenal; but so little did it ultimately answer this expectation, that in 1807, it was stated by the civil architect at Prince of Wales Island, that a ship built there would cost three times as much as one built at Rangoon or Bassein.\n\nFrom the appearance of many parts in the interior of the island, and the number of tombs that were discovered soon after the colony was formed, the tradition of its having been formerly inhabited seems to be entitled to credit; when taken possession of, however, there were only a few miserable fishermen on the sea coast. In 1785 it was granted to Captain Francis Light, of a country ship, by the King of Queda, as a marriage portion with his daughter. Captain Light transferred it to the East India Company, and was by them appointed first governor of the island, where he arrived in August, 1786. The early settlers had great difficulties to contend with; an immense forest was to be cut down, swamps to be drained, and ravines filled up. Within the first year 60 Chinese families removed from the adjoining countries and settled here.\n\nWhen Prince of Wales Island was occupied by the East India Company, they agreed to pay the King of Queda 6000 dollars annually, as an indemnification for the loss of revenue he was likely to sustain. In 1800, by a new treaty, he ceded along the opposite coast 18 miles in length, and three in breadth; in consideration of which the tribute was raised to 10,000 dollars per annum, at which it still continues.\n\nCaptain Light died in 1794, and was succeeded by Mr. Manningham, who died soon after in Bengal. In 1796 Major Macdonald took charge of the government, and died at Madras in 1799. He was succeeded by Sir George Leith, who lived and returned to Europe. The Hon. C.A. Bruce, brother to the Earl of Elgin, arrived as governor on the 24th of March, 1810, and died next December, universally regretted. This island is resorted to by invalids from Bengal and the Coromandel coast for a change of air; but, if we may draw any inference from the rapid mortality of the governors, the change is not for the better.\n\nIn 1801-2 the total number of inhabitants amounted to 10,310, of which number 1222 were slaves; in 1805 the inhabitants of all descriptions were estimated at 14,000, and have since been progressively increasing, and exhibit an uncommon diversity of races. Here are to be seen British, Dutch, Portuguese, Americans, Arabs, Parsees, Chinese,\nChulias, Malays, Buggesses, Birman, Siamese, Javanese, &c. &c. The settlement having risen in importance, the Company, in 1805, determined to constitute it a regular government, subordinate only to the Governor-General of India; but, on account of the enormous expense incurred by the establishment, some modifications have since taken place. (Sir G. Leith, Elmore, Howison, Marsden, Johnson, &c.)\n\nPrinces Isle.\u2014An island situated off the north-westernmost extremity of the Island of Java. Lat. 6\u00b0. 36'. S. Long. 105\u00b0. 12'. E. The land is in general low and woody; the highest eminence on it is called by the English the Pike. In 1694 it was uninhabited; but it now contains a town, named Samadang, divided into two parts by a river of brackish water. Turtle may be had here, as also fish, deer, plantains, pine apples, rice of the mountain kind, yams, and other vegetables. (Stavorinus and Notes, &c.)\n\nProme.\u2014A town in the Birman empire, named also Pecege Mew. Lat. 18\u00b0. 50'. N. Long. 95\u00b0. E.\n\nThis city was the original and natural boundary of the Birman empire to the south, although conquest has stretched their dominions several degrees further. This town is larger and more populous than Rangoon, which contains 30,000 inhabitants, and its market is also better supplied. At the upper end of the present city are to be seen the ruins of the ancient city of Prome; the modern fort is nothing more than a pallisadoed enclosure, with earth thrown up behind it. Adjacent to the town there is a royal menagerie of elephants, consisting of two rows of lofty and well built stables, in which these animals are lodged during the rains.\n\nMany ages ago Prome was the residence of a dynasty of Pegu kings, before the country had submitted to the Birman yoke; at present, along with the province, it forms the jaghire, or estate of the King of Ava's second son. The chief exports are stone flags and timber. A teak plank, three inches thick, and from 16 to 20 feet long, may here be purchased for half-a-crown. (Symes, &c.)\n\nPurna.\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, 63 miles E. from Moorshedabad. Lat. 24\u00b0. N. Long. 89\u00b0. 12'. E.\n\nPuckholi, (Paxali).\u2014A district to the north of the province of Lahore, situated about the 34th degree of north latitude, and bounded on the west by the Indus. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, this territory is described as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Puckely measures in length 35, and in breadth 25 coss. On the east lies Cashmere; on the north, Kinore; on the south, the country of the Gehkar tribe; and, on the west, is Attock Benares. Timur left a small number of troops to keep possession of this quarter, and some of their descendants are there to this day. Snow is continually falling in the mountains of this district, and sometimes in the plains. The winter is very severe, but the summer heat moderate. Like Hindostan, Puckely has periodical rains. Here are three rivers\u2014the Kishengung, the Behut, and the Sinde. The language of the inhabitants has no affinity with those of Cashmere, Zabulistan, or Hindostan. Naklud and barley are the most plentiful grains here. Apricots, peaches, and walnuts grow wild. Formerly, the rajahs of the country were tributary to Cashmere.\"\n\nDistant as is the period since Abul Fazel wrote, we have very little more recent information respecting this remote region than what he has supplied. The whole of this province now lies to the east of the Indus; but it is supposed in ancient times to have occupied also a tract of country on the western side. The common road from Cashmere to the Indus passes through Puckholi territory; but the inhabitants are so notorious for a fierce and predatory disposition, that the route is esteemed too\nhazardous. The district in general is of a mountainous surface, particularly from Muzaffarabad to Bazaar on the Indus; the inhabitants thinly scattered into distinct petty principalities, subject to chiefs of the Patan or Afghan race. (Abul Fazel, Rennel, Foster, &c.)\n\nPuckholi.\u2014A town situated to the north of the Lahore province, in the district of Puckholi, of which it is the capital, 30 miles E. from the Indus. Lat. 33\u00b0 46'. N. Long. 72\u00b0 8'. E.\n\nPucoulo\u00e9, (Paclu).\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Dacca Jelalpoor, 34 miles N. N. W. from Dacca. Lat. 24\u00b0 8'. N. Long. 89\u00b0 55'. E.\n\nPuducotta, (Paducota).\u2014A town in the Southern Carnatic, in the Polygar territories, 32 miles S. S. W. from Tanjore. Lat. 10\u00b0 20'. N. Long. 78\u00b0 59'. E. This was formerly the capital of Tondimau, which was the hereditary title of a polygar, and not the name of an individual.\n\nPulmary.\u2014A town in the Nizam's dominions, in the province of Aurungabad, 30 miles west of Jalnapoor. Lat. 19\u00b0 59'. N. Long. 76\u00b0 3'. E.\n\nPullicat, (Valiacata).\u2014A town on the sea-coast of the Carnatic, 25 miles N. from Madras. Lat. 13\u00b0 26'. N. Long. 80\u00b0 25'. E. The lake of Pullicat, on which it stands, appears to owe its existence to the seas breaking through a low sandy beach, and overflowing the lands within. Its communications with the sea are extremely narrow. This lake is in extent 33 miles from north to south, 11 miles across in the broadest part, and comprehends several large islands.\n\nThe Dutch established themselves here so early as 1609, when they built a square fort named Cedria; to which, after the loss of Negapatam, the chief government of their settlements on the Coromandel Coast was transferred. Their principal imports were arrack, sugar, Japan copper, spices, and other articles, brought from Batavia. In 1795, in consequence of the war with the Dutch, possession was taken of Pullicat, and it is now comprehended in the northern division of the Areot culectorship. (Rennel, Fra Paolo, &c. &c.)\n\nPulo Brasse Isle.\u2014A small island, about 10 miles in circumference, situated off the N. W. extremity of the Island of Sumatra. Lat. 5\u00b0 33'. N. Long. 95\u00b0 36'. E.\n\nPulo Baniack Isle.\u2014A small island, about 25 miles in circumference, situated off the west coast of Sumatra, between the second and third degrees of north latitude.\n\nPulo Dammer Isle.\u2014An island, about 30 miles in circumference, situated off the southern extremity of Gilolo. Lad. 1\u00b0. S. Long. 128\u00b0 25'. E.\n\nPulo Cannibaz Isle.\u2014A small island on the southern coast of Java, from which it is separated by a narrow strait. In length it may be estimated at 20 miles, by six the average breadth. Lat. 7\u00b0 56'. S. Long. 109\u00b0 25'. E.\n\nPulo Condore Isles.\u2014A cluster of small islands in the Eastern Seas, situated off the south of Cambodia. Lat. 8\u00b0 40'. N. Long. 106\u00b0 42'. E. The principal island is 12 miles in length, and about three in breadth.\n\nThis island is in the form of a crescent, and consists of a ridge of peaked hills. On the east side of the island there is a spacious bay of good anchorage. At the bottom of the bay there is a village, situated on a fine sandy beach. The inhabitants of Pulo Condore are mostly refugees from Cochin China, and are capable of supplying ships with some refreshments. Their flat faces, and little long eyes, denote a Chinese origin, but the spoken language of China is not intelligible to them. When the matter is written to them in the Chinese character it is perfectly intelligible.\n\nThe English had a settlement there until 1704, when an insurrection took place among the Malay sol-\ndiers, who first set fire to the Company's warehouses, and then murdered Mr. Catchpoole, the governor, and the greatest part of the English on the island. To this treachery the Malays are supposed to have been instigated by the Cochin Chinese, in order to obtain possession of the Company's treasure, estimated at 22,000 tael. (Stavnton, Bruce, &c., &c.)\n\nPulo Mintaou.\u2014An island, situated off the west coast of Sumatra, about the 98th degree of east longitude. In length it may be estimated at 35 miles, by 12 miles the average breadth.\n\nPulorum Isle.\u2014One of the smallest of Banda isles, named by all the early navigators Polaroon. Lat. 5\u00b0. 35'. N. Long. 129\u00b0. 45. E.\n\nThe English East India Company obtained possession of this island so early as 1617, but were repeatedly expelled by the Dutch. In March, 1665, it was formally delivered up by the Dutch to the English, but in so desolated a state (the whole of the spice trees being destroyed), that this station, which had been the subject of so many treaties and negotiations, was rendered totally useless for eight years. In 1666 it was re-occupied by the Dutch. (Bruce, &c., &c.)\n\nPuloway Isle.\u2014A small island, about 20 miles in circumference, situated off the north-west coast of Sumatra. Lat. 55\u00b0. 53'. N. Long. 95\u00b0. 45'. E. This island is about five leagues distant from the mouth of the Acheen River, and was once a volcano, sulphur being found on it. (Forrest, &c.)\n\nPulwall.\u2014A town in the province of Agra, 36 miles south from the city of Delhi. Lat. 28\u00b0. 11'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 18'. E. According to Abul Fazel, this place is the northern boundary of the Agra province, after which that of Delhi commences.\n\nPunda, (Punyada).\u2014A town in the province of Bejapoor, 25 miles S. E. from Goa, and near the S. W. extremity of the territory belonging to the Poonah Maharattas. Lat. 15\u00b0. 20'. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 3'. E.\n\nPundy, (Punyada).\u2014A town in the Northern Circars, 64 miles S. W. from Ganjam. Lat. 18\u00b0. 43'. N. Long. 84\u00b0. 40'. E.\n\nPunderpoor, (Punyadharapara).\u2014A town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Bejapoor, situated on the left bank of the River Becmal, 86 miles S. E. from Poonah. Lat. 17\u00b0. 56'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 12'. E.\n\nThis town is not very large, but regularly and well built. The streets are broad, well paved, and adorned with handsome houses, almost all the principal members of the Maharatta empire having dwellings here. The Peshwa's house is handsome, but Tuckojee Holkar's is still more elegant. Nana Furnavesc, Rastia, Purseram Bhow, and others, had houses here. Sindia has not any place of residence, but his mother had several.\n\nThe market is very extensive and well supplied, not only with grain, cloth, and the productions of the country, but with a variety of English articles, there being a whole street of boras' (Mahomedan pedlers) shops, in which the merchants of Bombay and Poonah are concerned. The first story of the buildings here are of stone, the second of brick, and make a handsome appearance. Leading from the town to the river are several fine ranges of stone steps, and the front next the river is faced with a wall of stone.\n\nPunderpoor is very populous and prosperous. The country to the south is well wooded and watered, and near the town the soil is good; but the Brahmins assert, that the lands around it are so holy that no grain will grow on them, and that they produce nothing but a consecrated shrub. The temple here is dedicated to a subordinate incarnation of Vishnu, under the name of Wittoba, which is said to have taken\nplace at no very remote period. He is sculptured in stone, about the size of a man, and standing with his feet parallel to each other. (Moor, &c.)\n\nPundua.\u2014See Purrah.\n\nPunganoor.\u2014A fortified town, now comprehended within the Balaghat ceded districts, 117 miles W. by N. from Madras. Lat. 13\u00b0. 19'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 42'. E. Two thirds of the Punganoor district were acquired by the company in 1799.\n\nPunjab, (or Five Waters).\u2014The province of Lahore is often named the Punjab than Lahore, but the Punjab being only a part of that province, and the term being applied to the natural division of the country, it properly includes part also of Mooltan. The eastern boundary of the Punjab is properly the ridge of snowy mountains, from whence its rivers spring; but, in a more limited sense, the Punjab means the country situated to the west of the hilly tract.\n\nThe territory designated by the name of the Punjab is very extensive, and remarkably fertile, producing abundantly all the necessaries of life, besides wine, sugar, indigo, cotton, and many luxuries. In the tract between the Jhyllum and the Indus there are salt-mines, which furnish inexhaustible stores of that article. The lower part of the Punjab, towards Mooltan, is flat and marshy, and inundated like Bengal, by the periodical rains, which fall between the months of May and October.\n\nThe Punjab, or Panchanada, is watered by five celebrated streams, that fall into the Indus, the Indus itself not being one. The names of the five rivers are\u20141. the Sutuleje; 2. the Beyah; 3. the Ravey; 4. the Chinaub; and 5. the Jhyllum, or Belhut. (Remel, Colebrooke, &c.)\n\nPunugga.\u2014A small village in Northern Hindostan, in the province of Bootan. Lat. 27\u00b0. 23'. N. Long. 89\u00b0. 23'. E. The mountains in the vicinity of Panugga are among the highest in Bootan. The peasantry here use, as a manure, pine-leaves, which are heaped together, and left to ferment and rot; after which they are esteemed a good manure. The pestiferous insect, so troublesome to the southward, at Murichom, does not reach this length. (Turner, &c.)\n\nPurneah, (Purinya).\u2014A large district in the province of Bengal, situated about the 26th degree of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by the Morung hills, in the Nepaul territories; on the south by Monghir and Rajemall; to the east it has Dinagepoor; and to the west Tirhoot and Boglipoor. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\u2014\n\n\"Sircar Poorencah, containing nine mahals; revenue 6,108,793 dams. This Sircar furnishes 100 cavalry, and 5000 infantry.\"\n\nThis district (named also Seerpoor Dulmalpoor) forms, beyond the Ganges, the north-west boundary of Bengal, towards Behar on the one side, and the Morung country to the north. Purneah comprises 5119 square miles, of a fertile, compact, well-watered flat\u2014producing rice, oil, pulse, wheat, with almost all the ordinary greens for home consumption. It produces also, opium and saltpetre for foreign commerce; to which may be added fir-masts, and other valuable timber, from the Morung forests. The northern part of this district, bordering on the Morung, is very thinly inhabited, being covered with immense woods of saul and other timber; but such parts of this tract as have been cleared are fertile, and suit extremely well for the cultivation both of rice and indigo, the latter being one of the staple commodities.\n\nPurneah, from the extent and goodness of the pasture land, is enabled to export a considerable quantity of ghee, or buffaloes' butter clarified; and it is particularly distinguished for an excellent breed of draught and carriage bullocks. Only\nthis district and Sirar Sarum produce bullocks of a standard suited for the conveyance of the baggage and artillery attached to the Bengal army; for which purpose above 5000 are generally employed on the Bengal establishment, exclusive of elephants and camels for the conveyance of camp equipage. These bullocks are well proportioned, large in size, capable of great exertion, and very superior to the draught cattle in Calcutta. The Company's cattle are allowed a certain quantity of grain per day, which they do not always receive; but when fed for slaughter, the carcase actually surpasses the best English beef.\n\nAbout 1790, the result of an official inquiry in the Purneah district found 80,914 husbandmen holding leases, and 22,324 artificers paying ground-rent, in 2784 villages, and upon 2531 square miles. Allowing five to a family, this gives more than 203 to a square mile. In 1801, the result of the replies of the collectors in Bengal to the questions circulated by the board of revenue, proved, that the Purneah district contained 1,450,000 inhabitants, in the proportion of seven Mahommedans to 10 Hindoos. The chief rivers are, the Cosah and Mahanada, and the principal towns, Purneah and Tanjepoor.\n\nDuring the Mahommedan government this was a frontier military province, under the rule of a fonsidjar, subordinate to the soubahdar, or viceroy, but possessing a great degree of independence. Syef Khan is the most famous of the provincial rulers, and governed until his death in 1159, Bengal year, under the successive viceroysalties of Jaffier Sujah and Ali verdi Khan. In 1139, he extended by conquest the limits of his jurisdiction towards Bahar beyond the Cosah, and added a considerable portion of productive territory on the side of Morung. He was succeeded by Soulet Jung, on whose death the fonsidarry was usurped by Shouket Jung, or Kha-dim Hossein Khan; but this rebellion was quashed in A.D. 1763 by Cossim Ali Khan, the reigning Nabob of Bengal.

In A.D. 1353 this was a royal residence, the capital of Ilyas, the second independent sovereign of Bengal, at which time it was besieged and taken by the Emperor Feroze. During the reign of Rajah Cansa, the Hindoo monarch of Bengal, who died in 1392, the city of Pundua was much extended, and the Brahminical religion flourished. His son, who became a convert to the Mahommedan faith, removed the seat of government back to Gour again. Some of the ruins of this city still remain, particularly the Adcena mosque, and the pavement of a very long street. (Stewart, Rennel, &c.)\n\nPuttan Somnaut, (Puana Somanatha).\u2014A town on the south-west coast of the Gujrat Peninsula, district of Puttan. Lat. 20\u00b0. 57'. N. Long. 70\u00b0. 23'. E. By Abul Fazel it is described as follows:\u2014\"This is a large town on the sea-shore, with a stone fort in a plain. The city is a place of great religious resort.\" Both the town and temple were plundered and destroyed by Mahmood of Ghizni, A.D. 1024. In a more modern period it was conquered from the Nagre Rajpoots by the band of Rhatore Rajpoots, who established the sovereignty of Sorut.\n\nQ.\n\nQuantong.\u2014A town in the Birman empire, situated on the south-\neast side of the Ava River, 25 miles distant from the frontiers of the Yunnan, in China. Lat. 24\u00b0. 2'. N. Long. 96\u00b0. 55'. E.\n\n**Quedah, (Kiddeh).** \u2014 A Malay principality in the peninsula of Malacca, situated on the west coast, between the fifth and eighth degrees of north latitude, and immediately opposite to Prince of Wales' Island. Seen from the latter the Quedah coast presents a considerable plain, covered with close wood, through which winds a river navigable for small craft up to the foot of the high mountains; from behind which, as viewed from George's town, the sun rises.\n\nThis country extends along the coast about 150 miles, and is from 20 to 35 miles in breadth, but the cultivated land nowhere exceeds 20 miles from the shore. From Trang to Purlis the sea coast is sheltered by many islands, the distance being 24 leagues, low, and covered with woods. The water is also remarkably shallow, ships being obliged to anchor a great distance from the shore. Along this tract 11 rivers empty themselves into the sea, but navigable for boats only.\n\nThe principal sea-port, called Quedah by strangers, and Quallah Batany by the natives, lies in Lat. 6\u00b0. N. The river is navigable for vessels of 300 tons; but the entrance is choked up by a flat mud bank, over which at spring tides there is only nine feet water, and the road where ships of burthen anchor is above two leagues from the shore. At the mouth of the river, which is 300 yards wide, there was a small brick fort, but it is now in ruins. Both shores are muddy, swampy, and covered with jungle. Seven miles further up the river is Allistar, where the king resides, to which place all vessels can ascend, whose draught of water permits to pass the bar. The river here is narrow, but deep, the country level and cultivated; but a little way above Allistar the ground rises, the river becomes more rapid, and navigable only for prows.\n\nThe entire country of Quedah is extremely well watered by 24 rivers; all navigable for prows, and some of them for larger vessels. Qualla Moodah is a shallow rapid river, but convenient on account of its communication with the tin mines; the annual produce of which is about 1000 peculs, and might be rendered much more. The country to the south is less cultivated than that to the north; but, being a flat country, supplied with a redundancy of moisture, it is extremely productive of rice, and abounds also with buffaloes, bullocks, and poultry.\n\nThe commodities of Quedah are tin, elephants' teeth, wax, &c., and the imports the same as at the other Malay ports\u2014opium and Spanish dollars composing the most valuable part of the cargo. It was a place of considerable trade before the establishment of Prince of Wales' Island; since which the commerce has been mostly transferred to the latter.\n\nIn 1786 an agreement was entered into with the King of Quedah for the cession of Pulo Penang, now Prince of Wales' Island, to the British. In May, 1792, a regular treaty of peace and amity, to continue as long as the sun and moon give light, was concluded; by which the East India Company engaged to pay the king 6000 dollars annually, while they remained in possession of the island.\n\nIn 1802 a new arrangement was entered into between the same parties; by the conditions of which Yeng de per Tuan, King of Quedah, agreed to make over to the East India Company all that part of the sea coast of his dominions between Qualla Kamican and the river side of Qualla Moodah, and measuring inland from the sea 60 orlongs; which tract of country the Company engaged to protect from all enemies, robbers, and pirates. The king agreed to permit the free exportation of provisions, and other articles, to Prince of Wales' Island, and en-\ngaged not to permit any European to settle in his dominions. The treaty also stipulated for the apprehension and delivery of insurgents, felons, debtors, and slaves; and, in consideration of the benefits accruing to the Company from these arrangements, they agreed to pay his Majesty of Queda 10,000 dollars annually, so long as they possessed Prince of Wales' Island and the coast above described. (Dalrymple, Treaties, Elmore, Johnson, Haensel, &c. &c.)\n\nQuinhone, (or Chincheu Bay).\u2014An excellent harbour in Cochin China, where vessels are sheltered from every wind. The entrance is narrow, and the want of a sufficient depth of water obliges vessels of great burthen to wait until high water to go in. Lat. 13\u00b0.52'. N.\n\nR.\n\nRabnabad Isle, (Ravana abad).\u2014A low, muddy island in the Bay of Bengal, formed by the sediment deposited by the Rabnabad River, one of the branches of the Ganges, and separated from the mainland by a very narrow strait. At neep tides it is scarcely above water, and at high spring tides is nearly submerged. It is, notwithstanding, covered with jungle, and swarms with deer, tigers, and alligators. In length it may be estimated at 15 miles, by five miles the average breadth.\n\nRachouty.\u2014A town in the Balaghaut ceded territories, district of Gururuncundah, 125 miles N.W. from Madras. Lat. 14\u00b0. 2'. Long. 73\u00b0. 49'. E.\n\nRafin.\u2014A town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Arun-gabad, 43 miles S.S.E. from Ahmednagar. Lat. 18\u00b0. 26'. N.

E.\n\nRahdunpoor.\u2014A town in the province of Gujrat, district of Werrear. Lat. 24\u00b0. N. Loug. 71\u00b0. 45'. E. This is an extensive place, surrounded by an ancient wall, in the curtain and towers of which there are numerous breaches. It has an inner fort or castle, a town wall and another wall, the whole surrounded with a dry ditch about 20 feet deep. In some particular parts there is a double ditch.\n\nThe town of Rahdunpoor is said to contain above 6000 houses, 1400 of which are inhabited by Banyans, Shroffs (money changers), some of whom are men of property and extensive commerce. From its geographical situation this place is a kind of emporium for the trade of Marwar and Cutch, but the road has, of late years, been little frequented, being greatly infested by the plundering Coolies. Formerly caravans of merchandize travelled from Joudpoor and the province of Ajmeer, by the route of Pauli, Sahore (or Sanjore), and Mandavie Bunder; but at present the escort required is so great as to engross the whole profit. The direct and safest road from Marwar, or Joudpoor, to Gujrat, is by Palhanpoor.\n\nThe staple commodities furnished by this city for foreign markets are ghee, wheat, and hides. The ghee is sent to Cutch, and the two latter to Bownagur, in the Gulf of Cambay, whence it is re-exported. No manufactures of any consequence are carried on here, except one of very coarse cloth for the Coolies. The inhabitants are mostly employed in agricultural pursuits, by which they have brought the vicinity of the town into a high state of cultivation. Wheat is usually sold for a rupee per maund, for which sum only three-fourths of a maund of bajerce are obtained.\n\nThe Rahdunpoor principality was founded by a Baloochy chief, named Rahdun Khan, who came from Par-\nkur; and Khan Jehan built the wall, and repressed the incursions of the Coolies. When Damaajee Guicowar compelled Kunnmaulud Deen Baubi (the father of the present Na-\nhob of Rahumpoor) to resign his claims to Pattan (or Nehrwallah), and its nine dependant pergunnahs, he was permitted to retain Rahumpoor, Manjepoor, and Somnee, which were part of the original pos-\nsessions of the family. A mes-\nsenger from hence to Joudpoor can go and return in about 15 days.\n\nMacmurdoo, &c.)\n\nRAHINY, (Rahani).\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Dinagpoor. Lat. 25\u00b0. 53'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 5'. E.\n\nRAHOON, (or Rahn).\u2014A town in the Seik territories, in the province of Lahore, 115 miles S. E. from the city of Lahore. Lat. 31\u00b0. 5'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 35'. E. This place is but a few miles distant from the Sutu-\nlege, which in the month of April has here the appearance of a canal running in two channels; the first fordable, and in breadth about 100 yards; the second is 350 yards across, the water deep, but not ra-\npid. During the height of the rains, the river here is above one mile and a half broad. From Rahoon baftas and piece goods are carried to the fair at Hurdwar. (11th Register, Raper, &c.)\n\nRAISSEEN.\u2014A district tributary to the Maharattas, in the province of Malwah, situated between the 23d and 24th degrees of north latitude, and bounded on the south by the Vindhaya Mountains. It is men-\ntioned by Abul Fazel, in 1582, as containing 32 mahuls. The chief towns are Raisseen, Bilsah, and Choonpoor. The Betwah is the principal river, and has its source in this district, but attains no magni-\ntude until it quits it.\n\nRAISSEEN.\u2014A town in the province of Malwah, the capital of a district of the same name, 126 miles east from Oojain. Lat. 23\u00b0. 19'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 47'. E.\n\nRAJAH CHOHNANS.\u2014A wild coun-\ntry in the province of Gundwana, situated between the 23d and 24th degrees of north latitude; the prin-\ncipal town of which is Sonchut, the usual residence of the Corair Rajah. This tract of territory is extremely rugged and mountainous, very little cultivated, and inhabited by some of the wildest tribes in India. The whole country is a succession of deep gullies, ravines, chasms, and defiles. The inhabitants are named Chohnans, and their rajah is tributary to the Maharattas, but not remark-\nable for the punctuality of his pay-\nments.\n\nThe land produces a little rice, Indian corn, and a few other smaller grains peculiar to hilly countries. South of Sonchut the country be-\ncomes more open, but the villages continue very poor, generally not consisting of more than four or five huts. There is a great abundance of game throughout the whole district. Among the animals of a more ferocious nature may be reckoned the royal tiger, leopards, tiger cats, and large black bears. Prior to the Maharrattas extending their conquests, in 1790, into these desolate regions, the Corair Rajahs appear to have lived in perfect independence. (Blunt, &c., &c.)\n\nRAJAMUNDRY, (Rajamandiri).\u2014A district in the province of the North-\nern Circars, situated about the 17th degree of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by Ciaccole; to the south, by Ellore; on the east it has the Bay of Bengal; and on the west the Nizam's territories, in the province of Hyderabad.\n\nPart of this district lies to the south, but the greater proportion to the north of the Godavery, which separates it from Ellore. This river divides itself into two great branches 35 miles from the sea, within which it forms the Island of Nagur, a tri-\nangular space comprehending 500 square miles, but of very great value in proportion to its extent. From the Poliveram zemindary, on the\nwest, the great range of hills limits this district, and the small river Settivaram describes its northern border towards Cicacole. The whole includes an area of 1700 square miles of accessible territory.\n\nThe intervening space between the small rivers Yellerie and Settivaram, is subdivided by water courses to answer the purposes of cultivation, in the two principal zemindaries of Peddapore and Pettipoor. The Island of Nagur is enclosed by the two greater branches of the Godavary, and intersected by five lesser ones, which render it very productive; it being the grand receptacle of all the slimy mould carried down by one of the greatest rivers in the Deccan. The forests of Rajamundry, from the commencement of the hills along the banks of the Godavary to Poloonshah, on the frontiers of Commanet, produce abundance of teak trees; this being the only country on the east side of the Bay of Bengal which furnishes this valuable species of timber.\n\nThe cultivation of sugar is carried on to a considerable extent in the Peddapore and Pettipoor zemindaries, along the banks of the Elyseram River, which, though small, has a constant flow of water in it the whole year, sufficiently large not only to water the sugar plantations during the driest seasons, but also a great variety of other productions, such as paddy, ginger, turmeric, yams, and chillies. The stream of water, during the driest season, renders the lands adjoining more fertile than almost any other in India, and particularly fit for the growth of the sugar cane. A considerable quantity of sugar also is raised in the Delta of the Godavery, and the cultivation might be increased to any amount. From the same spot they do not attempt to raise a second crop oftener than every third or fourth year, but during the intermediate time plants of the leguminous tribe are cultivated.\n\nThe method of cultivating the cane, and manufacturing the sugar, by the natives, in this district, is, like all their other works, extremely simple. The whole apparatus, a few pair of bullocks excepted, does not amount to more than six or eight pounds sterling. One acre of sugar, in a tolerable season, yields about 10 candy of sugar, each candy weighing about 500 pounds, and is worth on the spot per candy from 16 to 24 rupees. Here on an average six pounds of juice yield one pound of sugar from good canes. The refuse is given to cattle, or carried away by the labourers, there being no distillation of rum.\n\nThe principal towns of this district are Rajamundry, Ingeram, Coringa, Bundermalanca, Peddapore, and Pettipoor; but there is little export trade carried on at any port except Coringa. It was ceded to the French, in 1753, by Salabut Jung, the Soubahdar of the Deccan; and acquired to the British, by Lord Clive, in 1765. Since the first establishment of European government, Rajamundry has acquired many additional territorial dependencies by conquest and by policy. It now constitutes one of the five districts into which the Northern Circars were subdivided, on the introduction of the Bengal revenue and judicial system in 1803. (J. Grant, Roxburgh, Orme, &c. &c.)\n\nRajamundry.\u2014A town in the Northern Circars, the capital of a district of the same name, and situated on the east bank of the Godavary, 40 miles from the sea. Lat. 16\u00b0. 59'. N. Long. 81\u00b0. 54'. E. In the middle of the town, and near the river, there formerly stood a large fort, with mud walls of little defence.\n\nThe rajahs of Rajamundry are mentioned by Ferishta as independent princes when the Deccan was invaded by Allah ud Deen, A.D. 1295, and it was subjected by the Bhamenee sovereigns of the Deccan, A.D. 1471.\n\nTravelling distance from Hyderabad, 237 miles; from Madras, 365;\nand from Calcutta, 665 miles. (Orme, Rennel, &c.)\n\nRajanagur.\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Dacca Jelalpoor, situated on the east side of the Ganges, 23 miles S. by W. from Dacca. Lat. 23\u00b0 22'. N. Long. 93\u00b0 14'. E.\n\nRajegur, (Rajaghar).\u2014A town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Malwah, situated on the west side of the Sopra River, 67 miles N. E. from Oojain. Lat. 23\u00b0 56'. N. Long. 76\u00b0 27'. E.\n\nRajegur.\u2014A town in the province of Allahabad, situated on the west side of the River Cane, 18 miles S. E. from Chatterpoor. Lat. 24\u00b0 44'. N. Long. 80\u00b0 5'. E.\n\nRajegur Hills.\u2014A range of hills in the district of Bahar, province of Bahar.\n\nRajemal, (Raja mahal).\u2014A district in the province of Bengal, situated about the 25th degree of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by Purneah and Dinagepoor; on the south by Raujeshy; to the east it has Dinagepoor and Raujeshy; and on the west Monghir and Purneah.\n\nThis district, also called Achir Nuggur from its capital, and Cankjole on the revenue records, as being the chief military division, is principally situated on the western bank of the Ganges. It was formerly an important military government on the confines of Bengal towards Bahar, commanding some of the mountainous passes into either country, particularly the famous pass of Terriagnully, the possession of which was deemed of so much consequence in times of the hostile independence of the two soubahs. In 1784 Rajemal and Baglipoor contained, according to Major Rennel's mensuration, 10,487 square miles, of which 5435 were waste. The revenue of this great tract was then only 547,600 rupees.\n\nThe soil in the neighbourhood of Rajemal town is said to contain a mixture of granite rock, which is not to be found lower down the river. The plains in the neighbourhood are cultivated with wheat and barley, and the villages abound with mango trees of a good quality, planted in regular squares. The Indian corn, doff, kelai, and mustard, make part of the crops, as well as the more common articles of rice, the mulberry tree, and indigo plant. The fields are diversified with the castor oil plant, or ricinus palma Christi, the quantity raised far exceeding what is necessary for medical purposes. The jungle grass rises to the height of from eight to 10 feet, and is topped with a beautiful white down, resembling a swan's feathers.\n\nAt Sielygully is one of the villages formed in the wilds by government, by granting lands to the sepoy invalids, on condition of their residence and cultivation. Beyond this station, to the west, the province of Bengal finishes, and that of Bahar commences; and in the neighbourhood is a fine cascade. At Terriagnully, on the borders of the district, is a celebrated pass into the mountains up a narrow winding road, where there is a ruined gateway and fort. The roads are but indifferent, owing to the force of the torrents during the rains, which tear up the bridges, and carry devastation throughout the country. The zemindars have an allowance for repairs, but do not execute any.\n\nIn this district there is a great extent of waste and mountainous territory, inhabited by a wild race of people extremely different from those of the plains, and apparently of an aboriginal stock. They are mostly low in stature, but stout and well proportioned. There are many under four feet ten inches, and more under five feet three than above that standard, with flat noses, and lips thicker than the inhabitants of the plains. Their chief articles of traffic are common Hindostany bedsteads, wood, planks, charcoal, cotton, honey, plantains, and sweet potatoes; which they barter for salt, tobacco, rice, cloth, iron heads for arrows, hatchets, crooks, and iron instruments.\nTheir domestic animals are hogs, goats, and fowls, besides cats and dogs; the wild animals are in general the same among the hills as on the plains, except a species of large deer, and another remarkably small. The bow and arrow are the only weapons peculiar to these mountaineers; some few have swords, and still fewer matchlocks. They profess no veneration for the cow, and have no knowledge of letters, or of any sort of character. Indian corn is the most productive of their grain, and their chief subsistence. The greatest share of the labour falls on the women; and a man is rich in proportion to the number of his wives, who are so many labourers. These mountaineers are described as having an uncommon regard to truth, and an utter abhorrence to lying\u2014a description which, if just, forms the greatest contrast to their neighbours in the plains yet mentioned. They had long infested and devastated all the adjacent country; but about the year 1780 they were completely conciliated, and a permanent settlement arranged with them by Augustus Cleveland, Esq., the judge and magistrate of the district. This gentleman died in 1784, at the premature age of 29 years. To commemorate his exemplary conduct, a monument, in the form of a pagoda, was erected by the zemindars, and another at the expense of government.\n\nThe principal towns in this district are Rajemal and Maukka, and the chief river the Ganges; but, like the rest of Bengal, it is intersected (except in the hilly parts) by smaller streams in all directions. In the recent topographical arrangement of districts by the Bengal government, Rajemal has either lost its name, or been absorbed into the adjacent divisions; but, until a new map is executed, exhibiting the exact modern limits (which is much wanted), it is necessary in most cases to adhere to the old geographical delineation of the districts. (J. Grant, Shaw, Lord Valentia, Tennant, &c.)\n\nRajemal.\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, the capital of a district of the same name, situated on the S.W. side of the River Ganges, 70 miles N. N. W. from Moorshedabad, Lat. 25\u00b0. 2'. N. Long. 87\u00b0. 43'. E. This town at present consists of a street of mud cottages. Prior to 1638 it was the residence of Sultan Sujah, Aurangzebe's brother; but few vestiges of its ancient magnificence now remain. The ruins of his spacious palace are still standing, but have been much injured by the encroachments of the Ganges. Its empty halls, marble parlour, and half-decayed vaults, still present images of its former grandeur.\n\nDuring the reign of Acber, about 1591, Rajah Manse Singh, on his return from the conquest of the Afghans of Orissa, fixed upon the city of Agmahal for the capital of Bengal, the name of which he changed to Rajamahal; but by the Mahomedans it is occasionally designated by the name of Acbernagur. The rajah erected a palace, and surrounded the town with a rampart of brick and other fortifications. In 1608 the seat of government was removed from hence to Dacca by Islam Khan; but in 1639 Sultan Shujah brought it back, and strengthened the fortifications; of which, however, but few traces are now to be seen. The Ganges, which for a long time had been gradually changing its bed, about this time wholly quitted the vicinity of Gour, and approached the rocky bank of Rajemal, where it still holds its course. (Stewart, Lord Valentia, &c.)\n\nRajoor, (Rajavara).\u2014A town in the province of Berar, situated on the south side of the River Wurda, which here makes a considerable curve to the east, 10 miles S. E. from Chandah. Lat. 19\u00b0. 56'. N. Long. 80\u00b0. E.\n\nRajoorah, (Rajarava).\u2014A town in the Nizam's territories, in the province of Aurungabad, 40 miles S. W. from Nandere. Lat. 18\u00b0. 38'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 15'. E.\nRAJPOOR, (Rajapura).\u2014A town in the territories of the Maharatta Peshwa, in the province of Bejaipoor, situated on the sea-coast of the Concan district. Lat. 16\u00b0. 48'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 3'. E.\n\nRAJPOOTANA, (Rajputana).\u2014See AJMEER.\n\nRAJPOOR.\u2014A small village in the province of Gujrat, near its western boundary, and about five miles north from Theral.\n\nIn this neighbourhood are a range of elevated sand hills, covered with an impervious jungle of baubool and other bushes. The surrounding country is also an immense expanse of jungle, with a few wretched villages, distinguishable by the smoke, the dens of predatory thieves scattered amongst it. From hence the mountains of Jassore in Marwar are visible. (Macmurdo, &c.)\n\nRAKAU RIVER.\u2014A river in the Island of Sumatra, to the northward of Siak, and much the largest in the island, if it should not rather be considered as an inlet of the sea. It takes its rise in the Rau country, and is navigable for sloops to a great distance from the coast; but vessels are deterred from entering it by the rapidity of the current, or more probably the reflux of the sea. (Marsden, &c.)\n\nRAMAGIRI, (Ramaghiri).\u2014A small town in the Mysore Rajah's territories, 50 miles N. E. from Serinagapatam. Lat. 12\u00b0. 44'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 33'. E.\n\nThis place is dreadfully infested by tigers, especially the fort, which occupies a large rocky hill, capable of a very tedious defence even without any assistance from art. Several Brahmins reside on the summit, which is reputed holy, but kept in a very slovenly state. It is plentifully supplied with water from several large cavities or chasms in the rock, which receive the rain, and by their coolness prevent a rapid evaporation.\n\nLac is produced on several of the neighbouring hills upon the tree called jala, but cattle is the principal object of the people around this place. In all diseases of the ox kind the grand remedy is actual cautery, fancifully applied in different places. Although the killing of an animal of this kind is considered by the Hindoos as actual murder, there is no animal whose sufferings exceed those of the labouring cattle in Hindostan. The usual price here of a middling ox five years old, some years back, used to be 16s. 9d. sterling.\n\nIn this hilly tract there is a wild race of men, called by the other natives Cad' Eligaru, but who call themselves Cat Chensu. They subsist on game, wild roots, herbs, and fruits, and a little grain purchased from the farmers in the plains, which they are enabled to do by collecting some drugs, honey, and wax. Their language is a dialect of the Tamul, with occasionally a few Karnata or Telunga words intermixed. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nRAMERGH.\u2014A town in the Nizam's territories, in the province of Hyderabad, 55 miles N. W. from Worangol. Lat. 18\u00b0. 31'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 32'.

To the north it is bounded by the district of Bahar Proper; on the south by Nagpoor and Pachete; to the east it has Monghir and Pachete; and on the west Palamow. The modern district of Ramgur comprehends a much greater space, and part of it may be considered as belonging to the ancient Hindoo province of Gundwana.\nThis highland division of Bahar is, from its situation, rocky and unprofitable, and can never be brought into a populous or cultivated state, unless great encouragement to new inhabitants be held out\u2014great part of its territory being mountainous, and overrun with impenetrable woods. All the hills in this quarter of the Bahar province abound with iron, which is fused for sale by the natives in large quantities. The chief rivers are the Dummoodah and the Burrahkur; and the principal towns, Ramgur, Chittra, and Muckundgunge. The country is but thinly inhabited, and a very great proportion of the population Hindoos of the Brahminical persuasion; but accurate returns of these particulars have not been yet published. (Lord Teignmouth, J. Grant, &c.)\n\nRamgur.\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, district of Ramgur, and situated on the north bank of the Dummoodah River, 190 miles N.W. from Calcutta. Lat. 23\u00b0. 38'. N. Long. 85\u00b0. 43'. E.\n\nRamgur.\u2014A town possessed by independent zemindars, in the province of Orissa, situated on the south side of the Mahanuddy River, 102 miles west from Cuttack. Lat. 20\u00b0. 38'. N. Long. 84\u00b0. 35'. E.\n\nRamgurry.\u2014A hill fort in the Mysore Rajah's territories, distant 20 miles from Chitteldroog, which is in sight bearing north east. While possessed by Tippoo the eastern side was the only part up which it was possible to climb, and every accessible spot was strongly fortified. The passage up admits but of three or four persons at a time, and winds through several gates and walls. It requires a considerable time to reach the top, where there is a town and reservoir for water, but it is neither good nor plentiful. There is a square pettah of no great extent at the bottom, on the eastern side enclosed by a wall.\n\nThat the natural strength of this country is very great may be conceived from the fact, that six other hill forts are in sight from the tower on the top of Ramgurry, viz. Chitteldroog, Hunmandroog, Rangundroog, Oochinadroog, and Chandgherry. (Moor, &c.)\n\nRamisseram Isle, (Rameswaram, the Pillar of Rama).\u2014An island situated in the straits, between the Island of Ceylon and the continent, separated from the latter by a narrow strait. In length it may be estimated at 11 miles by six the average breadth, and is low, sandy, and uncultivated. Lat. 9\u00b0. 17'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 21'. E.\n\nRamisseram is an island of great sanctity, and possesses a celebrated pagoda, the entrance to which is through a lofty gateway, about 100 feet high, covered with carved work to the summit. The door is about 40 feet high, and composed of single stones, placed perpendicularly with others crossing over\u2014the massiveness of the workmanship resembling the Egyptian style of architecture. The square of the whole is about 600 feet, and it is probably one of the finest pieces of architecture in India. Into the inner temples none are permitted to enter but the attendant Brahmans, who live in the town, and have their share of the offerings. When the Rajah of Tanjore used formerly to visit this place of pilgrimage, his expenses exceeded 60,000 pagodas. The deity uses no other water but what is brought by devotees the whole way from the Ganges, which is poured over him every morning, and then sold to the devout\u2014thus bringing a considerable additional revenue to the temple.\n\nThe guardianship of this sacred isle is in family of devotees, the chief of which is named the Pandaram, and doomed to perpetual celibacy, the succession being carried on by the sisters, or by the collateral branch. The greater part of the income is appropriated to his use, and to that of his relations, who have possessed the supreme power above 90 years. When Lord Valentia visited this island, in 1803, the Pandaram re-\nquested his lordship's protection for their deity.\n\nPanban, the capital of the island, is distant about nine miles from the great temple, the road from which has been paved the whole way by the contributions of the pious; and nearly every 100 yards is a choultry, with its attendant Brahmins. The strait here is about a mile wide, but not passable, except for very small vessels. The bed is rocky, and the entrance from the north only 100 feet wide, between two rocks; and as another directly faces it, and the current is extremely rapid, much caution is required to pass in safety. In the year 1310 the Mahommedans, under Mallek Naib, invaded the Carnatic, and pushed the depredations as far as this place, where they erected a mosque. (Lord Valentia, MacKenzie, Scott, &c.)\n\nRamisser, (Rameshwaram). \u2014 A town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Khandesh, situated at the junction of the Ghirib River with the Tuptee, 66 miles W.S.W. from Boorhanpoor. Lat. 21\u00b0. 4'. E. Long. 75\u00b0. 21'. E.\n\nRamkewra, (Ramacumara). \u2014 A town belonging to the Peshwa of the Maharattas, in the province of Bejapoor, 27 miles N.E. from Poonah. Lat. 18\u00b0. 41'. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 20'. E.\n\nRamnad, (Ramanatha). \u2014 A town in the Southern Carnatic, in the district of Marawas, 130 miles N.E. from Cape Comorin. Lat. 9\u00b0. 24'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 49'. E.\n\nThe Ramnad polkam, or zemindary, was granted to the ancestors of the present family with the title of Setheputtis, for the defence of the road and protection of the pilgrims resorting to the sacred pagoda at Ramisscrum. Here is a fort, commenced many years ago by the Ranny's ancestors, but never completed. The palace adjoins to it, and is a gloomy building, with lofty walls, and no window on the outside. Near to it are the tomb of the Ranny's deceased husband, and a Protestant church of very neat architecture.\n\nThe walls are externally completed, and are of massive stones, with loop holes at the top. It is still in good repair, but has no cannon mounted, as there is no rampart within.\n\nThis town and district are governed by the Ranny, who pays the Company two-thirds of the clear revenue, amounting to 90,000 pagodas per annum. There remains for herself 45,000 pagodas per annum, which is a large revenue in so cheap a country. This old lady's title is Ranny Soodoopuddy, Munglasoovary Natichiar. The first is a title, the second points out her power over Ramisscrum, the third is her name, and the fourth denotes her as eldest daughter.\n\nThe imports of Ramnad are chiefly confined to supplies of betel nut from Ceylon, and red silk cloths from Bengal; and to those places respectively piece goods, cotton, and chank shells, are exported. The total value of the imports from places beyond the territories of Madras, between the 1st May, 1811, and the 30th April, 1812, was Arcot rupees 30,990, viz.\n\n| From Calcutta | - - - - | 2,661 |\n| Ceylon | - - - - | 18,334 |\n| Various places | - - - - | 9,995 |\n\nArcot rupees 30,990\n\nThe total value of the exports during the above period was Arcot rupees 95,766, viz.\n\n| To Calcutta | - - - - | 31,772 |\n| Ceylon | - - - - | 63,994 |\n\nArcot rupees 95,766\n\nBetween the dates above specified 107 vessels and craft, measuring 1792 tons, arrived; and 119 ditto, measuring 2952 tons, departed. (Lord Valentia, Parliamentary Reports, Hodson, &c.)\n\nRamnode, (Ramanatha). \u2014 A town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Malwah, 40 miles S.S. E. from Narwar. Lat. 25\u00b0. 6'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 5'. E.\nRampoor, (Ramapura).\u2014A town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Malwah, 13 miles east from Bopal. Lat. 23\u00b0.15'. N. Long. 77\u00b0.42'. E.\n\nRampoor.\u2014A town in the province of Delhi, district of Bareily, situated on the banks of the Cosilla River, 40 miles N. N. W. from Bareily; 110 east from Delhi. Lat. 28\u00b0.50'. N. Long. 78\u00b0.58'. E.\n\nThis town and district, at the peace of Lalldong, in 1774, were secured to Fyzoola Khan, a Rohillah chief, at which time the revenue was valued at 30 lacks of rupees per annum. During the life time of Fyzoola Khan, Rampoor was very prosperous; and, at his death, comprehended a space four miles in circumference, surrounded by a thick bamboo hedge, within which were mud fortifications, and containing above 100,000 inhabitants. It has since been greatly reduced both in size and population, and probably now does not contain a fifth part of the above number.\n\nOn the death of Fyzoola Khan, in August, 1794, his eldest son, Mahammed Ali, succeeded; but was soon afterwards assassinated by his second son, Gholam Mahomed, who seized the throne. A British force, under Sir Robert Abercrombie, was marched to expel the usurper, which was attacked by the Rohillah army a few miles in advance of Bareily; but they were repulsed after a severe action, in which the British lost 600 men and 14 officers. Gholam Mahomed surrendered to the British soon after; and the accumulated treasures of Fyzoola Khan, amounting to three lacks and 22,000 gold mohurs (640,000L) were delivered up to the Nabob of Oude, Asoph ud Dowlah, who presented the British army with 11 lacks of rupees. Possession was also taken of the Rampoor district for the government of Oude; but a jaghire (estate) was reserved for Ahmed Ali Khan, a minor, the grandson of Fyzoola Khan, of which the town of Rampoor was part, and the revenue 10 lacks of rupees per annum.\n\nThe flourishing and highly cultivated state of this district, during the life of Fyzoola Khan, exhibited a great contrast to the condition of the Oude dominions by which it was surrounded, and proves how rapidly a country, under a good native government, attains to prosperity. The quickness of its decay, and its deplorable condition when ceded to the British in 1801, prove how speedily a bad one operates the reverse. (Franklin, Rennel, &c.)\n\nRampoora.\u2014A town in the province of Gujrat, district of Chalawara, eight miles N. W. from Sylah. This place belongs to Wudwan, and formerly had a respectable fort, which was destroyed in 1805.\n\nIn the neighbourhood of Rampoora are a great many pallias, which are stones erected to the memory of any person who has fallen by a weapon, and more particularly in defending his village. In this part of Gujrat an attacking enemy will estimate the degree of resistance by the number of pallias in the vicinity, it being disgraceful for a Rajpoot to shun the battle, whose family inherits many of these monuments of valour. Pallias are also erected to commemorate females who have burned with their husbands, and are here so frequent, that in one field adjacent to Rampoora, not exceeding a square acre in extent, there are from 60 to 70 of these monuments of posthumous fidelity. (Macmurdo, &c.)\n\nRandier.\u2014A town in the province of Gujrat, district of Broach, situated opposite to Surat on the north side of the Tuptee River. Lat. 21\u00b0.16'. N. Long. 73\u00b0.3'. E. Abul Fazel, in 1582, asserts, that in ancient times it was a large city.\n\nRangamatty, (Rangamati, Red Clay).\u2014A district in the north-east extremity of Bengal, situated about the 26th degree of north latitude. On the north it is bounded by Bodtan; on the south by the Garrow Hills; to the east it has Assam; and\non the west Cooch Bahar and Rungpoor. During the Mogul government this territory was comprehended within the jurisdiction of Rungpoor, in which it still continues. It stretches on both sides of the Brahmapootra easterly to the confines of Assam, throughout a wild and uncultivated region of 2629 square miles, many parts of which are capable of being rendered extremely productive; but at present yield little to the sovereign, except a few elephants, annually caught in the interior and neighbouring forests. The chief river is the Brahmapootra, which nearly divides the district, and the principal towns Ragamatty and Goalparah. (J. Grant, ye.)\n\nRANGAMATTY.\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, the capital of a district of the same name. Lat. 26\u00b0. 9'. N. Long. 90\u00b0. E.\n\nRANGOON, (or Yanghong).\u2014The principal sea-port town in the Birman empire, in the province of Pegu. Lat. 16\u00b0. 47'. N. Long. 96\u00b0. 9'. E. The entrance of the river below Rangoon resembles that of the Gauges, but the navigation is more commodious; the channel being hold, and from six to eight fathoms deep, without shoals. Twelve miles below Rangoon it is about three quarters of a mile wide. The mouth of the Syriam, or Pegu River, is about three miles below the town, when it joins that of Rangoon. The country above is a level plain, with clumps of trees at distant intervals, and much depopulated by the frequent wars of the Birmans and Peguers.\n\nThe town of Rangoon stretches along the banks of the river about a mile, and is not more than the third of a mile in breadth. The city, or mieou, is a square surrounded by a high stockade; and on the north side is further strengthened by an indifferent fosse, across which a wooden bridge is thrown. In this face there are two gates, in each of the others only one. Wooden stages are erected within the stock-\n\nade for musketeers to stand on in case of attack. A battery of 12 pieces of cannon, six and nine pounders, raised on the banks, commands the river; but the guns and carriages are so bad they could do little execution.\n\nThe streets of the town are narrow, and much inferior to those of Pegu, but clean and well paved. There are numerous channels to carry off the rain, over which strong planks are laid. The houses are raised on posts from the ground; the smaller supported by bamboos, and the larger by stout timbers. All the officers of government, the most opulent merchants, and persons of consideration, live within the fort; shipwrights and people of inferior rank inhabit the suburbs; and one entire street, called Faekally, is exclusively assigned to common prostitutes, who are not permitted to dwell within the precincts of the fortifications. Swine, which do not belong to any particular owner, are suffered to roam at large, and act as common scavengers, devouring the filth under the houses.\n\nThe population of this place is considerable. There are 5000 registered, taxable houses in the city and suburbs, which, at six persons per house, will amount to 30,000. There is here a congregation, consisting of former Portuguese colonists, who are numerous, but in general very poor. They have erected a neat chapel, and support their pastor by voluntary contributions. The Parsees, Armenians, and a small proportion of Mahomedans, engross the largest share of the Rangoon trade, and individuals, from their number, are frequently selected by government to fill employments of trust, that relate to trade and transactions with foreigners. There is a wooden wharf here for the delivery of ships' cargoes, and a custom-house built of brick and mortar, and covered with tile, which is the only building in the town not constructed of wood. On\nthe opposite side of the river is a town, called Maindee, composed of one long street.\n\nRangoon having long been the asylum of insolvent debtors from the different settlements of India, is crowded with foreigners of desperate fortunes, who meet with a friendly reception from the Birmans, and for the most part support themselves by carrying on a petty traffic. Here are to be met fugitives from all countries of the East, and of all complexions. Mahabars, Moguls, Persians, Parsies, Armenians, Portuguese, French, and English\u2014all mingle here on the exchange. The members of this discordant multitude enjoy the utmost toleration from the Birmans, who have no desire to make proselytes, and never discuss the religious opinions, or disturb the ceremonies of any other sect, provided they do not break the peace, or meddle with their own divinity Gandma.\n\nThe River of Rangoon is extremely commodious for the construction of ships. The spring tides rise 20 feet perpendicular, the banks soft, and so flat, that there is need of little labour for the formation of docks, and vessels of any burthen may be built. The Birman shipwrights are athletic men, and possess in an eminent degree that vigour which distinguishes Europeans from the natives of the East. Madras is supplied from Rangoon with timber for all common purposes of domestic use. It is supposed, ships can be built at Rangoon for one-third less than at Calcutta, and for nearly half less than what they cost at Bombay; but the Pegue built ships are not so constructed, and are generally deficient in the iron work. The imports from the British settlements consist chiefly of coarse piece goods, glass, hardware, and broad cloth. The returns are made almost wholly in timber. A few small commodities are carried from Pegu to the coast of Pedir in Sumatra, and the Prince of Wales' Island, for the China market. In 1800, the cost of shipbuilding at Rangoon was 13l. per ton, coppered and equipped in the European style.\n\nFrom Rangoon there are 10 or 12 boats fitted out annually, and about 30 more from various towns on the Irawaddy River, which proceed by the way of the Bassien River, though the channels which divide the Great Negrals from the continent, along the coast of Aracan to Luckipore, Dacca, Calcutta, Bogwangola, and even to Patna and Benares. They are in general boats carrying from 1000 to 1500 maunds (of 80 lbs each), with a crew of from 20 to 25 men. Every boat is supposed to contain, on an average, the value of 4000 rupees, chiefly in bullion; the remainder consists of sheathing boards, sticks of copper from China, stick lac, cutch, ivory, and wax.\n\nTwo and a half miles north of Rangoon is the temple of Shoeda-gon, or Dagoung, which is a very grand building, but not so high by 25 or 30 feet as that of Shoenadoo, at the city of Pegu. From the many convents in the neighbourhood of Rangoon, the number of rhahaans (priests) and phongies (an inferior order of priests, vulgarly called tallapoins) must be considerable, probably exceeding 1500. They go barefooted, and have their heads close shaven, on which they never wear any covering.\n\nThe foundation of Rangoon was laid by the victorious Alompra, the first of the present Birman dynasty; and it is also named Dzangoon, which signifies victory achieved. Here stood, in former days, a large and populous city, called, in the Pali, or sacred language, Singoonterra, the site of which Alompra explored, and raised on its ruins the present flourishing sea-port. In January, 1810, this place was almost totally destroyed by fire; but in a country of forests a wooden town is soon rebuilt.

E.\n\nRANTAMPOOR, (Ranotam pura).\u2014A city in the province of Ajmeer, in the centre of the Arrabane Hills, Lat. 26\u00b0. 2'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 25'. E.\n\nThis fortress was built by Rajah Ameer Singh, in the reign of the Emperor Alla ud Deen, and is esteemed one of the strongest and largest in India. As no European has yet approached it, the nature of its strength is not known. The natives represent it as being situated on seven hills, the sides of which are all completely scarped, and accessible only by one path. The city of Madhoopoer, or Neyashehr, is at the distance of two or three miles from Rantampoor, and is second in size and consequence only to Jycnagur. The approaches to it are, however, guarded with as much jealousy as those of Rantampoor.\n\nTravelling distance 120 miles S.W. from Agra; from Oojain, 260 miles. (Broughton, Rennel, &c.)\n\nRAREE.\u2014A town situated on the sea coast of the province of Beja-poor, 17 miles N. by W. from Goa. Lat. 15\u00b0. 50'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 30'. E. This place and Veugorla belong to the Colapoor Rajah and to the Dessi Warr.\n\nRATTOLAW, (Rayatula).\u2014A sea port in the province of Gujrat, situated in the vicinity of a navigable river on the Gulf of Cambray, 44 miles S. W. from the city of Cambay. Lat. 22\u00b0. 3'. N. Long. 72\u00b0. 15'. E. This place was ceded to the Company by the Guicowar Maharatta chief in 1803.\n\nRAUJESHY, (Rajshahi).\u2014A centrical district in the province of Bengal, situated principally between the 24th and 25th degrees of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by Dinagepoor and Mymunsingh; on the south by Birbhoorn and Kishenagur; to the east it has Dacca Jelalpoor and Mymunsing; and on the west Monghir and Birbhoorn.\n\nThis is the most extensive and unwieldy zemindary in Bengal, and in 1784 comprehended, according to Major Rennel's mensuration, 12,909 square miles, yielding a revenue of 24 lacks of rupees. It is intersected in its whole length by the Ganges, or lesser branches, with many navigable rivers and fertilizing waters. Within its limits are produced four-fifths of all the silk, raw or manufactured, used in or exported from Hindostan; and it contains the commercial and populous towns of Moorshedabad, Cossimbazar, Baulah, Bogwangola, Commercolly, &c., and has many other provincial cities and manufacturing towns in its neighbourhood. In 1725 this zemindary was conferred on Ram Jecon, a Brahmin, the founder of the present family. In times of remote Hindoo antiquity, a part of this district, subject to annual inundation, was named the region of Varandra.\n\nIn 1801, by the directions of the Marquis Wellesley, then Governor General, the board of revenue in Bengal circulated various questions, on statistical subjects, to the collectors of the different districts. The result of their replies proved, that Raujeshy contained 1,500,000 inhabitants, in the proportion of three Mahommedans to five Hindoos; and that, since the permanent settlement of the revenue, the produce of this district has greatly increased. (J. Grant, Colebrooke, &c.)\n\nRAVEY RIVER, (Iravati).\u2014This is the third river of the Punjab, and the Hydroates of Alexander's historians. It rises in the eastern hills of Cashmere, near a famous place of Hindoo worship, and not far from the sources of the Sutulce, the Chinaub, and the Beyah rivers. Its direction is afterwards south-westerly, and it enters the plains near Shapoor (or Rajepoor), from whence the\ncanal of Shahnehr was drawn to Lahore, about 80 miles in length. This canal was intended to supply the city of Lahore with water during the dry season, when all the Indian rivers are from 20 to 30 feet below the level of their banks. The space between the Ravey and Chinaub, at their entry into the plains, is about 60 geographical miles, and they gradually approach each other during a course of 170 miles.\n\nAfter entering the plains, the course of the Ravey continues S. W. until it passes the city of Lahore, 60 miles above which it is 120 yards broad, and extremely rapid, yet navigable, during the rains, for boats of a considerable size. It continues to flow in the same direction after passing Lahore, and about 28 miles above the city of Mooltan is joined by the Jhyium and Chinaub, forming a stream of unequal breadth, scarcely inferior to the Indus itself. Its rapidity and breadth, after their junction, are particularly remarked by the historians of Alexander and Timour. Immediately after their junction, the distance from bank to bank is one mile, one furlong, and 85 yards. In the month of January, but a little way lower down, the breadth of the stream contracts to less than 350 yards. Twenty miles below Mooltan, this river falls into the Indus, after having performed a course, including the windings, of above 500 miles. (Rennel, Wilford, &c.)\n\nRAVREE, (Ravi).\u2014A town among the Western Ghants, in the province of Bejapoor, 45 miles S. S. W. from Poonah. Lat. 18\u00b0. 2'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 32'. E.\n\nThis was the first strong hold seized on by Sevajee, the founder of the Maharatta power, who made it his capital. In 1688, after the death of Sevajee, it was taken by Aurengzebe, along with the family and treasure of Sambajee Rajah, the second Maharatta sovereign, whose power was in consequence reduced to a very low ebb. (Scott, Bruce, &c.)\n\nRAWAAD.\u2014A small town in the Seik territories, in the province of Lahore, 120 miles N. W. from the city of Lahore. Lat. 33\u00b0. 5'. N. Long. 72\u00b0. 12'. E.\n\nRAWAK ISLE.\u2014A small island, which forms a harbour on the N. E. coast of Wageeoo. The channel is here a mile broad, with good mud soundings from 10 to 15 fathoms. Sago, made up in cakes, may here be purchased in large quantities; fish and turtle are also plenty. The Malays and the natives cut the latter into small pieces, and stew it in green bamboos. Goats and fowls are not to be had. (Forrest, &c.)\n\nRAYBAUGH, (Rai Bagh, the Ray's Garden).\u2014A district in the Maharrata territories, in the province of Bejapoor, situated between the 16th and 17th degrees of north latitude. This is a fertile and productive territory, being watered by the Krishna, Gutpurba, and several smaller streams. The principal towns are Raybaugh and Badar.\n\nRAYBAUGH.\u2014A town in the Maharrata territories, in the province of Bejapoor, 15 miles south from Merritch. Lat. 16\u00b0. 46'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. E. This place is enclosed by a bad wall, having entrances on the north and west sides. It is not populous or extensive, nor does its appearance indicate that it ever was a place of consequence. Near to the northern gate are some Mahommedan tombs. (Moor, &c.)\n\nRAYPOOR.\u2014A town in the Seik territories, in the province of Lahore, district of Bhatti, situated on the banks of the Beyah and Hyphasis. In the 15th century this place was called Tulwundy, and was the birthplace of Nanac Shah, the founder of the sect of Seiks.\n\nRAYSINGPOOR.\u2014A small village in the Gujrat Peninsula, near the Gulf of Cutch, and belonging to the Jam of Noanagur. This place stands on the banks of the Phooljee River, and has a considerable number of gardens in the vicinity, in some of which cardamons are raised.\nREDDYGOODUM, (Retigharum, a sand fort).\u2014A town in the Northern Circars, district of Condapilly. Lat. 16\u00b0. 53'. N. Long. 80\u00b0. 41'. E.\n\nReher.\u2014A small district in the province of Delhi, situated between the 28th and 29th degrees of north latitude, and formerly comprehended in the territory of Rohilcund. It is bounded on the north by the Sewa-lic and Kemaoon mountains; on the south by Bareily; to the east it has the Kemaoon hills and Kilpoory; and on the west the Ganges. In the arrangement of the Aeer it belonged to the division of Sumbhulpoor. The Ganges is the principal river; but many small streams flow from the adjacent mountains. The chief towns are Reher, Najibabad, and Daraanagur. This district was ceded to the British during the administration of Marquis Wellesley, by the treaty concluded with the Nabob of Oude, the 10th November, 1801, at which period it was in a very desolate state, but has since much recovered.\n\nReher.\u2014A town in the province of Delhi, 80 miles N. N. W. from Bareily, and the capital of a district of the same name. Lat. 29\u00b0. 23'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 44'. E.\n\nRehio, or Rio, (Rijn).\u2014A Malay town, situated on the island of Bintang, at the S. E. extremity of the peninsula of Malacca. Lat. 57\u00b0. N. Long. 104\u00b0. 35'. E.\n\nIn 1783 this place was the resort of smugglers and pirates, and was attacked and taken by the Dutch Commodore, Van Braam, but appears soon to have recovered, as, in 1784, Hajee Rajah, the chief of Rehio, was killed at Malacca, of which place he had undertaken the siege. (Forrest, &c.)\n\nRejang.\u2014A country in the island of Sumatra, divided on the north-west from the state of Anak Sungei, (of which Mocomoco is the capital), by the small river Uni, near that of Kuttaun, which last, with the district of Laboon on its banks, bounds it on the north, or inland side. The country of Musi, where the Palembang River takes its rise, forms its limits to the eastward. Benecoolen River confines it on the southeast. The principal rivers, besides those already mentioned, are, the Laye, the Pally, and the Sungeilamo, on all of which the English had factories.\n\nThe Rejangs are divided into tribes, of which there are four principal ones. They live in villages, each under the government of a head, or magistrate, styled Dupati, and seldom exceed in number 100. These Dupatis meet in a judicial capacity, when the Pangeran (a Javanese title), or feudal chief of the country, presides over the whole, but has little or no coercive power. Though the rank of Dupati is not strictly hereditary, the son, when of age and capable, generally succeeds his father; if too young, the father's brother, or such of the family as appear best qualified.\n\nThe system of letters of the people of Rejang has the same artificial order with the Devanagari; but, in every series, one letter is omitted, because it is never to be found in the languages of the eastern islanders. The Rejang dialect is formed by a mixture of the Batta and Malaya. (Marsden, Jones, Leyden, &c.)\n\nRembang.\u2014A Dutch residency, on the north-eastern coast of Java, producing salt and timber for shipbuilding. Lat. 6\u00b0. 40'. S. Long. 111\u00b0. 15'. E. A ship of 500 tons burthen, and three or four smaller vessels, used annually to be built here for the Dutch East India Company. (Stavorinus, &c.)\n\nRenapoor, (Renapure).\u2014A town in the Nizam's territories, in the province of Aurungabad, 71 miles N. W. from Beeder. Lat. 10\u00b0. 20'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 55'.

E.\n\nRetpoorah, (Retipura).\u2014A town\nin the Nizam's territories, in the province of Berar, 17 miles S. E. from Elllichpoor. Lat. 21\u00b0. 19'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 21'. E.\n\nRewah, (Reva).\u2014A town in the province of Gundwana, district of Boghela or Bogalicund, of which it is the capital. Lat. 24\u00b0. 37'. N. Long. 81\u00b0. 25'. E. This town and district composed a fourth part of the ancient Cirear of Callinjer, and with Sohagepoor was dismembered from Bhatta by Aurcingzebe, and nominally annexed to Allahabad. It then included in all 9000 square miles.\n\nThe suburbs of Rewah are large. Under the fort runs the Biehanaddy, which has its source 20 miles to the eastward. The rajah's house is in the fort, which is of stone, and very large. The country from Rewah to Raypooor is well cultivated, with many fine tanks. The latter is a place of considerable size. Travelling distance from Benares, 126 miles S. W. from Nagpoor, 304 miles. (J. Grant, Leckie, Rennel, &c.)\n\nRewary, (Revari).\u2014A town in the province of Delhi, district of Narouil, 40 miles S. W. from the city of Delhi. Lat. 28\u00b0. 13'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 42'. E. In the time of Acher, it was the capital of a distinct district, which is described by Abul Fazel as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Rewary, containing 12 mahals, measurement 4,155,011 beegahs, revenue seyurghal, 739,268 dams. This sircar furnishes 2,175 cavalry, and 14,000 infantry.\"\n\nIt is now possessed by native chiefs, in alliance with, or under the influence of, the British government.\n\nRhotas.\u2014A district in the province of Bahar, situated for the most part between the 24th and 25th degrees of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by Shahabad; on the south by the independent district of Billounjah and Palamow; to the east it has the district of Bahar; and to the west Chunar. In 1784 this district contained 3680 square miles, of which about 2000 square miles were plain arable ground. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Rotas, containing 18 mahals, measurement 473,340 beegahs, revenue 40,819,493 dams. This sircar furnishes 4550 cavalry, and 162,000 infantry.\"\n\nThis is the most westerly of the Bahar province, and lies chiefly between the rivers Soane and Caramnassa. The southern part is hilly, and much covered with jungle; but the northern is flat, well watered, and extremely fertile. The principal towns are Rhotas, Saseram, Bogwanpoor, and Serris. (J. Grant, Abul Fazel, &c.)\n\nRhotas, (Rahatas).\u2014A fortress in the province of Bahar, district of Rhotas, 81 miles travelling distance S. E. from Benares. Lat. 24\u00b0. 38'. N. Long. 83\u00b0. 58'. E.\n\nThis place stands on the level top of an extensive mountain. The only entrance to it is a very narrow road through a steep ascent of two miles, from the bottom of the hill to the gates, which are three in number, one above the other, defended by guns, and large stones ready to be rolled down. The square contents of the fortified table land on the top of the mountain is more than 10 miles, in which space are contained towns, villages, and corn fields, water being found within a few feet of the surface. On one side runs the River Soane under an immense precipice; another river in the same manner passes close to the other side; and both meeting a short way below, form the hill into a triangular peninsula. On the third side there is a very deep valley covered with impervious woods, which spread all over the mountain, and render the fortress almost inaccessible.\n\nA.D. 1542 Shere Shah, the Afghan, took this fortress, then deemed impregnable, by a very shallow stratagem, from Rajah Chintamun, the last of a long dynasty of Hindoo\nsovereigns, who had for many centuries ruled this part of Hindostan; and there Shere Shah deposited his family and treasure. It appears, however, to have soon reverted to the Hindoos; as, in 1575, it was again taken from a rajah of that faith by the Emperor Acher. Since it came into the possession of the British, the necessity for them no longer existing, the fortifications have been allowed to crumble into ruins. (Stewart, J. Grant, Rennel, &c. &c.)\n\nRhotas.\u2014A very small, hilly district in the province of Lahore, in the Seik territories, and situated about the 33d degree of north latitude.\n\nRhair River.\u2014A small river issuing from the Rajah Chohan Hills, in the province of Gundwana, which, after a short course of not more than 80 miles, falls into the Soane, in the district of Rhotas, in Bahar. For above 20 miles before its junction with the Soane it is above 100 yards wide, and four feet deep.\n\nRiao Isle.\u2014A small island in the Eastern Seas, about 30 miles in circumference, situated in the channel between Gilolo and the Island of Morty. Lat. 2\u00b0. 30'. N. Long. 128\u00b0. E.\n\nRio. See Rehio.\n\nRogonatgunge, (Raghunatha Ganj).\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Pachete, 136 miles W. N.W. from Calcutta. Lat. 23\u00b0. 15'. N. Long. 86\u00b0. 20'. E.\n\nRogonatpoor.\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Pacheti; 130 miles N.W. from Calcutta. Lat. 23\u00b0. 32'. N. Long. 86\u00b0. 44'. E.\n\nRohilcund, (Rahilkhand).\u2014This territory, named in sanscrit Kuttair, comprehended that tract of Hindostan situated east of the Ganges, between the 28th and 30th degrees of north latitude, and from 78\u00b0. to 80\u00b0. east longitude. Commencing in the vicinity of the Loddong Pass, at the foot of the Kemaoon Hills, it extended south-eastward to the town of Pillibect. On the north it was bounded by the Sewalic and Kemaoon Hills, and on the south by the dominions of Oude, the principal rivers being the Ganges and Ramgunga: the latter traverses Rohileund nearly in its whole extent, and joins the Ganges at Kanoge.\n\nOn the eastern side the Dewali, or Goggya, issues from the Kemaoon Mountains, and runs past the town of Pillibect, where, during the height of the rains, saul and sissoo timbers, the produce of the adjacent forests, are embarked for Patna, Calcutta, and other large towns to the south. There are many smaller streams intersect the country, and contribute to its fertility, being distributed by means of canals and reservoirs; water is also found by digging a few feet under ground. With all these advantages Rohilcund is calculated to be one of the richest countries in the East; and the greatness of its productive powers were exemplified in a small portion of it, during the government of Fyzoolah Khan at Rampoor; it was, notwithstanding, when ceded to the British by the Nabob of Oude in 1801, one of the most desolate regions in Hindostan. The chief articles raised by the cultivators are grain of all sorts, sugar-cane, indigo, cotton, and tobacco.\n\nIn the early periods of the Mogul empire Rohilcund was a very flourishing country, and of great political importance. It then contained the cities of Shahabad, Shahjehanpoor, Barcily, Bissowlee, Budayoon, Owlah, Moradabad, and Sumbul; which last communicated its name to a great part of the district. During the reign of the Patan dynasty in Hindostan, many princes of the royal family kept their court, for a series of years, in the city of Budayoon, where, as in many other parts of Rohilcund, are still to be seen the remains of magnificent edifices, palaces, gardens, mosques, colleges, and mausoleums.\n\nThe Rohillas were originally an\nAfghan or Patan race, who emigrated from the province of Cabul about the beginning of the 18th century. They then consisted of several independent tribes, who, on pressing exigencies, acted in concert, and were distinguished for the steady hatred which subsisted between them and the Maharattas. They are a courageous, hardy race, and one of the few Mahommedan tribes who exercise the profession of husbandry, as well as that of arms. Their high spirit and ferocious, uncultivated dispositions, render them difficult to govern or discipline; and, in common with the other Afghan races, they have the reputation of being cruelly, treacherous, and sanguinary.\n\nAbout the year 1720 the Afghan chiefs, Bisharat Khan and Daood Khan, accompanied by a band of their needy and adventurous countrymen, came to Hindostan in quest of military service. They were first entertained by Madhoo Sah, the Zamindar of Serowly, who, by robbery and predatory incursion, maintained a large party of banditti. While plundering an adjacent village, Daood Khan captured a youth of the Jaut tribe, whom he converted to the Mahommedan religion, named Ali Mahommed, and adopted to the prejudice of his own children. Daood Khan was succeeded as principal leader of the Rohillahs by Ali Mahommed, who, in consequence of the distracted state of Hindostan, soon established his power over the territory since named Rohilcund, although repeatedly brought to a low ebb by the Mogul armies from Delhi. Ali Mahommed died in 1748, and left six sons; but was succeeded in the chieftainship by Hafez Rehmunt, whose authority, however, was constantly disputed by other leaders. In 1774 the combined forces of the Rohillahs were totally defeated by the British army at the battle of Cutterah, where Hafez Rehmunt was slain, and with this event terminated the Rohillah sway in Hindostan.\n\nAt the period when the conquest of Rohilcund was completed, the country was in a very flourishing state, and the revenue computed to exceed one million sterling per annum; but afterwards it declined with incredible rapidity, and in 1795 yielded only 36 lacks of rupees. In 1801 nearly the whole of ancient Rohilcund was ceded to the British by the Nabob of Oude, during the administration of Marquis Wellesley, and is now, for the most part, comprehended in the province of Bareily; under which head further topographical details will be found. (Franklin, Forster, &c.)\n\nRolph.\u2014A small district in northern Hindostan, situated between the 29th and 30th degrees of north latitude, and tributary to the Ghoorkhali Rajah of Nepaul. Although little more than 60 miles from the British territories in the province of Oude, this district has never been visited by any European, and remains almost wholly unknown. The surface is irregularly mountainous, and much covered with jungle, and the country little cultivated, and thinly inhabited.\n\nRolph.\u2014A town in Northern Hindostan, the capital of a district of the same name, tributary to the Nepaul Rajah. Lat. 29\u00b0. 22'. N. Long. 82\u00b0. 5'. E.\n\nRoma Isle.\u2014A small island in the Eastern Seas, about 40 miles in circumference. Lat. 7\u00b0. 35'. N. Long. 127\u00b0. 20'.

E.\n\nRopoor.\u2014A town in the Seik territories, in the province of Delhi, situated in the S. E. bank of the Sutuleje, 130 miles S. E. from the city of Lahore. Lat. 31\u00b0. 7'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 50'. E.\n\nRounda.\u2014A town in the Maharratta territories, in the province of Khandesh; situated on the east side\nof the Ghirah River, 46 miles S.W. from Boorhanpoor. Lat. 20\u00b0. 54'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 47'. E.\n\nRoy Bareily.\u2014A town in the Nabob of Oude's territories, situated on the north side of the Sye River, 45 miles S.E. by S. from Lucknow. Lat. 26\u00b0. 16'. N. Long. 81\u00b0. 12'. E.\n\nRuanelli.\u2014A valley in the Island of Ceylon, called by the Canadians, in whose territory it is situated, the valley of precious stones. Up to this place the river is navigable for boats; but, from hence to Candy, it is shallow and rocky. From hence to Columbo, the capital of the British part of Ceylon, the distance by water is about 60 miles; yet so rapid is the current, that the passage is made in about eight hours, but, in returning, occupies nine and 10 days.\n\nSeveral kinds of precious stones and metallic substances are found in the environs of Ruanelli, among the sand and gravel of the river. On the opposite side of the river precious stones were formerly found in abundance; but the King of Candy does not now permit them to be dug or searched for. (Perceval, &c. &c.)\n\nRudraprayaga.\u2014A Hindoo place of pilgrimage in the province of Serinagar, where the Atacananda River joins the Caliganga\u2014a large stream, which rises in the mountains of Kedar, and is, in the Shastras, denominated the Mandacini. The confluence of these rivers at this place is one of the five principal prayagas, or holy places, mentioned in the sacred books of the Hindoos. Lat. 30\u00b0. 19'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 2'. E.\n\nRub Isle.\u2014A small island in the Eastern Seas, situated off the north-western extremity of Wagego, and surrounded by a multitude of smaller islands, with very deep waters between them. Lat. 0\u00b0. N. Long. 129\u00b0. 55'. E.\n\nRumbo.\u2014A Malay kingdom in the peninsula, situated about 60 miles inland from the city of Makeca. The sultan, and all the principal officers of this state, hold their authority immediately from Menangcabow in Sumatra, and have commissions for their respective offices. This proves the extent of the Menangcabow power even now, reduced as it is in common with that of the Malay people. The Rambo people have a peculiar dialect, called by the inhabitants of Malacea the language of Menangcabow. (Refles, &c. &c.)\n\nRun.\u2014A very extensive salt morass, which bounds the western frontiers of the Gujrat province, communicates with the Gulf of Cutch, and exhibits a great variety of appearances. In some places it is a widely expanded sheet of shallow water, only a few inches deep; in others, an impassable salt swamp; and, in others, merely a dry unproductive bank of sand\u2014but, in all parts, strongly impregnated with saline particles, adverse to vegetation.\n\nIncluding the windings it extends many hundred miles, and sweeps round the north of Cutch. It appears, at some remote period, to have been covered with the waters of the ocean, which have since subsided, and are even still imperceptibly draining off. A satisfactory description of this extraordinary morass is much wanted.\n\nRunalay, (Ranaleya, the Place of Battle).\u2014A town in the Maharratta territories, in the province of Kandesh, 84 miles E. from Surat. Lat. 21\u00b0. 17'. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 20'. E.\n\nRungpoor, (Rangapura).\u2014A district in the north-eastern extremity of the province of Bengal, situated about the 20th degree of north latitude. It is bounded on the north by the Bootan Hills; on the south by Mysnunus; to the east it has the Brahmapootra; and, on the west, Dinagepoor. From Cooch Behar it is separated by the River Durlah.\n\nUnder the Mogul government this was a military frontier station, towards the Morung and Cooch Ba-\nhar. It was first partially wrested from the rajah of the latter district, during the reign of Shah Jehan, when it was formed into a cirar; but it was completely conquered, by the generals of Aurengzebe, in 1660-1, when it received the name of Fakeroonody. This territory, with the pergunnah of Koondy, constitute the modern district of Rungpoor, comprehending a territory of 2,679 square miles, distributed into several zemindaries, and producing the valuable articles of raw silk, opium, tobacco, sugar, besides superabundance of grain and other articles which are exported.\n\nWithin the jurisdiction of Rungpoor may be included the extensive district of Ranganatty, and the adjoining rajahship of Cooch Bahar\u2014comprising, in all its dimensions of financial divisions, 6610 square miles.\n\nThe face of the country is open, level, and well watered, and inferior to no part of Bengal in point of fertility. The rice cultivation is very extensive; and of this grain, in good land, it sometimes yields two crops in the year, besides an intermediate one of mustard seed. There is some indigo grown, and a great deal of tobacco of a good quality, and remarkably cheap\u2014a great proportion of the tobacco consumed by the natives, in the southern and eastern districts of Bengal, being supplied from Rungpoor. The principal rivers are the Teesta, the Durlah, and the Brahmapootra; and the chief towns, Rungpoor, Mungulhaut, and Guzzotta.\n\nNotwithstanding the productive powers of this district its population does not amount to so great a number as might have been expected. In 1801 the board of revenue in Bengal, in consequence of instructions from Marquis Wellesley, then governor-general, circulated various inquiries to the collectors of the different districts. The result of their replies proved, that Rungpoor and Cooch Bahar contain only 400,000 souls.\n\nThe glandular swellings in the throat are so prevalent in this district, that it is supposed one person in six is affected with them; yet the town of Rungpoor is 100 miles from the foot of the Bootan Hills, and still further off from any snow. (J. Grant, Turner, Saunders, &c.)\n\nRungpoor.\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Rungpoor. Lat. 25\u00b0. 47'. N. Long. 89\u00b0. 5'. E. This place is 260 miles travelling distance from Calcutta, the road indifferent, and intersected by an amazing number of rivers and rivulets, which must be crossed in boats; yet, in a palanquin, this distance is with ease gone over in four days.\n\nRungpoor.\u2014This town is frequently named the capital of Assam; but it is only the military station to the real capital, Gergouge. A considerable number of towns form a circle round the Rungpoor division, which is 12 miles in length by 10 in breadth.\n\nTo the west of Rungpoor is a bridge, built in the reign of Roodra Singh, by workmen from Bengal, which may be deemed the western gate of the military fortress of Rungpoor; which is accessible from the westward only through this port, as the river in this quarter is seldom fordable. It is protected on the south by an immense causeway, or line of fortification, which extends from Namdaugh to the Dhekow. (Wade, &c. &c.)\n\nRupnagur, (Rapanagara, the handsome City).\u2014A town belonging to Dowlet Row Sindia, in the province of Ajmeer, district of Ajmeer, 13 miles N. E. from the city of Ajmeer.

E.\n\nRuttunpoor District.\u2014See Choteesghur.\n\nRuttunpoor, (Ratnapura, Diamond Town).\u2014A town in the territories of the Nagpoor Maharattas, in the province of Gundwana, district of Choteesghur, of which it is the capital. Lat. 22\u00b0. 16'. N. Long. 82\u00b0. 35'. E.\n\nAlthough this be the capital of an extensive and fertile district, yet it is only a large straggling village, consisting of about 1000 huts, many of which are uninhabited. The surrounding country is remarkably productive and well cultivated, compared with the rest of this desolate province. By the nearest travelling road Ruttunpoor is 296 miles from Chunar. Its chief is frequently styled the Rajah of Chotees Ghur, or 36 fortresses.\n\nNear to Ruttunpoor is an idol, made of blue granite, about nine feet in height, rubbed over with red paint, and adorned with flowers. In the neighbourhood are a great many pools and tanks, and also a lake, the embankment of which is nearly two miles in length. There are many ruins in the vicinity, indicative of a former state of prosperity superior to what at present exists.\n\nIn the year 1760, when Mr. Law was made prisoner, a party of 120 French, who had been under his command, endeavoured to effect a retreat from Bahar, through the country, into the Deccan. They halted here; when Bimbajee, the Maharatta sovereign, entertained them for a few days\u2014but, at the end of that time, put them all treacherously to death.\n\nTravelling distance from Calcutta, by Chuta Nagpoor, 493 miles; from Nagpoor, 220 miles; from Delhi, 633; from Poonah, 706 miles, (Blunt, Leckie, 1st Reg. Reenel, &c. &c.)\n\nRyacotta, (Raja Cotay).\u2014A town added to the Barramatal province, at the peace granted by Marquis Cornwallis to Tippco, and the last place in the Karnata Desam, 98 miles E. by N. from Seringapatam. Lat. 12\u00b0. 33'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 17'. E.\n\nThis place being the chief key to Karnata, (the Upper Carnatic, or Mysore,) pains have been taken to strengthen the works, which consist of a high fortified rock, and a fort at the bottom. The air of Ryacottah is so very temperate, on account of its elevation, that, even in the hot season, the thermometer scarcely ever rises higher than 82\u00b0 of Fahrenheit, and cherry-trees flourish remarkably well. The people of Ryacotta, being on the frontier, speak a mixture of the languages of Karnata, of the Tamuls, and of the Telingas.\n\nWhen Ryacottah was besieged by Major Gowdie, in 1791, it was known to be too strong by nature to be reduced, if the garrison made a resolute defence; but the governor was so intimidated by the spirited attacks of his detachment, and by a movement of the grand army towards the place, that he capitulated, and retired into the Carnatic below the Ghauts. After its surrender it was found to be amply supplied with guns, ammunition, and provision for its defence; and, although Kistnaglerry be the principal fort, Ryacottah, from its situation, may be considered the chief key to the Mysore dominions. (F. Buchanan, Divon, Salt, &c. &c.)\nRYAGUDD.\u2014A town possessed by independent zemindars, in the province of Orissa, 60 miles N.W. from Cicacole. Lat. 19\u00b0. 1'. N. Long. 83\u00b0. 27'. E.\n\nRYCHORR, (Rachur).\u2014A district in the Nizam's territories, in the province of Bejapoor, extending along the north bank of the Toombuddra River, between the 15th and 16th degrees of north latitude.\n\nRYCHORR.\u2014A town in the Nizam's territories, in the province of Bejapoor, the capital of a district of the same name, 130 miles S.W. from Hyderabad. Lat. 15\u00b0. 59'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 17'. E.\n\nThis is an irregularly built town, being an old fort with some new works, commanded by a hill, and by some rising grounds near it. In point of rank it was the second town in the jaghire of Bazalet Jung, son to Nizam ul Mulk, and brother to the late Nizam nd Dowlah. Adoni was his capital, and continued after his death to be that of his son Dara Jahl, until Tippoo took it from him, and nearly destroyed it, when he removed to Rychoor, which had the advantage of being more distant from so formidable a neighbour. Here, however, he suffered nearly as much from his uncle, the Nizam, who imposed so high a tribute on him, as reduced him to the condition of a mere renter. (MSS. &c.)\n\nRYDROOG, (Rajadurgu).\u2014A small district in the Balaghat ceded territories, situated principally between the 14th and 15th degrees of north latitude. The Roggyr is the chief river, and the principal towns Rydroog and Mulkaamarroor.\n\nThe family of the Rydroog polygar is descended from the Dalawai of Bijanagur, who, on the dissolution of that government, seized on Pemaconda and Condrippy. Under Aurengzebe he obtained, or seized, additional villages. In 1766 the district was subdued by Hyder; and, in 1788, the polygar was seized by Tippoo, and sent to Serinagapatam, where he died a violent death. His son and successor, Vincatuppy Naic, was killed in 1791, while attempting to escape from Bangaloor. At the peace of 1792 this district was transferred to the Nizam; and, in 1799, Gopaul Naic, a descendant by the female line, attempting to raise disturbances, was sent prisoner to Hyderabad.\n\nIn 1800, in consequence of arrangements with the Nizam, this district was ceded to the Company, from whom the polygar's family receive a pension, and the country is now comprehended in the collectorship of Bellary. (Munro, &c.)\n\nRYDROOG.\u2014A town in the Balaghat ceded territories, 170 miles N. by E. from Serinagapatam, and the capital of a district of the same name. Lat. 14\u00b0. 49'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 2'. E. This place stands about 40 miles N.E. from Chitteldroog, the country between them being fertile, with very few hills of magnitude, and no river of considerable bulk. About 1790 the Maharattas obtained possession of it, by a bribe of 60,000 rupees to the governor on Tippoo's part.\n\nTravelling distance from Hyderabad 252 miles. (Moor, Remel, &c.)\n\nRYNABAD, (Ghainabad).\u2014A small village in the province of Bengal, district of Jessore, 80 miles E. by N. from Calcutta. Lat. 22\u00b0. 42'. N. Long. 89\u00b0. 44'. E. For many years after the British obtained possession of Bengal, rumours were current that extensive ruins of magnificent cities existed among the jungles of the Sunderbunds, and particularly in the vicinity of Rynabad; but after repeated investigations none have yet been discovered, nor is it probable that any very ancient ruins should be found in a territory, which is itself of recent formation, and destitute of fresh water.\n\nRYEPORR.\u2014A town in the province of Guindwana, district of Chooteesgur, 69 miles south from Rutunpoor. Lat. 21\u00b0. 17'. N. Long. 82\u00b0. 26'. E.\n\nThis town, from its population and\ncommerce, might be ranked the first in the Choceesgur district, and second in the Nagpoor territories. It contains about 3000 huts; and there is a stone fort on the N. E. side of the town, the walls of which are decayed, but the ditch is deep and wide.\n\nThe soil in this neighbourhood is a rich black mould, nowhere more than three feet in depth, under which is found the solid rock, as is perceptible in all the beds of rivers, and in the sides of tanks and wells. The only road from Cuttack to Nagpoor passes through this town.\u2014(Bhout, &c.)\n\nS.\n\nSABRAO ISLE.\u2014An island in the Eastern Seas, separated from that of Floris by the Straits of Floris, and situated between the eighth and ninth degrees of south latitude. In length it may be estimated at 40 miles, by 18 miles the average breadth.\n\nSADRAS.\u2014A town on the sea coast of the Carnatic, 47 miles south from Madras. Lat. 12\u00b0. 27'. N. Long. 80\u00b0. 16'. E.\n\nThis town is now in a state of decay. There was formerly a small fort surrounded by a brick wall, 15 feet high, and close to the sea; which was seized on by M. Lally during the siege of Madras, in violation of the Dutch neutrality. The houses at present are rapidly decaying, and the inhabitants retiring to more prosperous situations. In the time of the Dutch, who frequented it so early as 1647, it was a populous place, where gingams of a superior quality were manufactured. In 1795, in consequence of the war with the Dutch, possession was taken of Sadras, and it is now comprehended in the Chingleput collectorship. (Lord Valentia, Fra Paolo, 5th Report, &c.)\n\nSAFINAFF ISLES.\u2014A cluster of very small rocky islands in the Eastern Seas, situated between the fifth and sixth degrees of south latitude, and about the 118th of east longitude.\n\nSAGANEER.\u2014A town in the province of Gundwana, belonging to the Nagpoor Rajah, 40 miles N. N. W. from the town of Nagpoor. Lat. 21\u00b0. 34'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 18'. E.\n\nSAGANEER.\u2014A Rajpoot town in the province of Ajmeer, district of Jyenagur, eight miles S. E. from the city of Jyenagur. Lat. 26\u00b0. 49'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 50'. E.\n\nSAGOR ISLAND, (or Gungusager, the Confluence of the Ganges with the Ocean.)\u2014An island belonging to the province of Bengal, situated on the east side of the Hooghly, or Calcutta River, which separates it from another island, here formed by the numerous outlets of the Ganges. This station is not found so destructive to the crews of ships as those further up the Hooghly; and it is proved by experience that the further down the river the less sickness prevails, and that Sagor is the healthiest anchorage in the Hooghly. On account of the great expansion of the river, ships have the advantage of lying at a great distance from the shore, enjoy consequently a refreshing circulation of sea air, and escape the offensive exhalations from the mud banks at Culpee and Diamond Harbour.\n\nSagor Island is a celebrated place of pilgrimage among the Hindoos, on account of its great sanctity, which arises from its situation at the junction of the holiest branch of the Ganges with the ocean. Many of the pilgrims formerly made voluntary sacrifices of themselves, and sometimes offered their children, to the sharks and alligators inhabiting the surrounding waters. It is said, that in 1801, 23 persons were exposed or drowned here in the course of one month; but, in 1802, the practice was abolished by Marquis Wellesley. On shore the jungles swarm with tigers of the largest and most ferocious.\ncious sort, so that both elements are equally dangerous. (Johnson, C. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nSAHABAD.\u2014A Rajpoot town, tributary to the Maharattas, in the province of Ajmeer, 85 miles E. by N. from Kotah. Lat. 25\u00b0. 26'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 10'. E.\n\nSAHRANPOOR, (Saharunpura).\u2014A district in the province of Delhi, situated about the 31st degree of north latitude, and principally in the doab of the Ganges and Jumna. To the north it is bounded by the Sewalie Mountains and the province of Serinagur, now tributary to the Ghorrhkhali Rajah of Nepaul. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, this district is described as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Saharanpoor, containing 36 mahals, measurement 3,530,370 beegals; revenue 87,839,359 dams. Seyurghal 4,991,485 dams. This sircar furnishes 3955 cavalry, and 22,280 infantry.\"\n\nThe soil of this district is extremely fertile when under proper cultivation, producing grain of all sorts, sugar, indigo, cotton, and tobacco. For the greater part of the year the climate is temperate, and during some of the winter months excessively cold; but in the height of summer the heat is intense, and the country almost burned up.\n\nAlthough placed betwixt two large rivers, the Ganges and the Jumna, which here run nearly parallel to each other at the distance of about 55 miles, this district is not subject to the periodical inundation which prevails in Bengal and the more southern provinces. The surface of the country is a continued flat to the bottom of the hills, when they rise abruptly, marking the northern limits of the immense valley through which the Ganges flows to the sea. The principal town is Saharanpoor.\n\nThe territory originally possessed by Nijib ud Dowlah, an Afghan chief, appointed prime minister to Shah Allum by Ahmed Abdallah, the sovereign of Cabul, comprehended the district of Saharanpoor, that of Sirhind, and some tracts of country round Delhi. He was succeeded by his son, Zabetra Khan, who, dying in 1785, was succeeded by the execrable Gholauam Cawdir Khan, who, in 1788, put out the eyes of the unfortunate Emperor, Shah Allum, with a dagger; and tortured, starved to death, and massacred, many of the royal family. A few months subsequent he was himself put to death with tortures by Madhajee Sindia, who conquered the greater part of his dominions.\n\nIn 1803, Saharanpoor, with all the other Maharatta possessions in the doab of the Ganges and Jumna, were acquired by the British government; and, in 1804, it was separated into two divisions, the northern and the southern, with a civil establishment to each; but at a more recent period this arrangement was modified, and great part of the southern division annexed to the district of Merat. Until the ravages it sustained under the turbulent reigns of Aurengzebe's successors, Saharanpoor was esteemed one of the most productive territories in the empire; but from that monarch's death, in 1707, until its acquisition by the British in 1803, it scarcely had an interval of rest from external invasion or internal dissension. (Scott, Franklin, Abul Fazel, &c.)\n\nSAHRANPOOR.\u2014A town in the province of Delhi, the capital of a district of the same name, 105 miles N. by E. from Delhi. Lat. 30\u00b0. 15'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 23'. E.\n\nSAHRANPOOR.\u2014A town in the province of Delhi, district of Saharanpoor, 90 miles N. by W. from Delhi. Lat. 30\u00b0. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 16'. E.\n\nSAIBGUNGE, (Sahabganj).\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Rungpoor, 38 miles N. N. W. from the town of Rungpoor. Lat. 26\u00b0. 15'. N. Long. 88\u00b0. 48'. E.\n\nST. BARBES' ISLE.\u2014A small island in the Eastern Seas, situated under the equinoctial line, Lat. 167\u00b0. 40'. E. In making this island from the N. W. it looks like two islands,\nthe extremes being higher than the centre. It is about three leagues in circumference. There is anchorage where wood and water may be had on the S. E. side of this island, in 25 fathoms water. (Emore, &c.)\n\nSt. Bernardino (Straits of).\u2014These straits separate the islands of Luzon and Samar in the Philippines, and have a small island in the centre of the same name; the whole being greatly infested by the piratical prows, which plunder and enslave the inhabitants.\n\nSt. Julian Isle.\u2014A very small island in the Eastern Seas, about 18 leagues distant from Victoire Isle. Lat. 0\u00b0. 49'. S. Long. 106\u00b0. 50'. E.\n\nSt. Matthew's Isles.\u2014A cluster of very small islands, situated about 25 leagues east from the Island of Bootan, between the fifth and sixth degrees of south latitude, and the 124th and 125th of east longitude.\n\nSt. Thome.\u2014A small town in the Carnatic, near to Madras, named by the natives Mailapram, or the City of Peacocks. Lat. 13\u00b0. 1'. N. Long. 80\u00b0. 22'. E.\n\nThis place is situated close to the sea, which forms here a kind of bay or small haven. It stands in a fine plain, abounding with cocoa nut trees, which retain their verdure throughout the whole year. The inhabitants consist of Hindoos, Mahomedans, and Roman Catholic Christians; the latter being a bastard race, a mixture of the Portuguese and natives, and of a very dark complexion.\n\nWhen the Portuguese commander, Gama, took the town of Meliapoor (St. Thome's), he found a great many inhabitants who professed the Christian religion, of the Nestorian or Chaldean persuasion. He changed the name of the place to St. Thome in honour of the apostle, which it still retains among Europeans. In July, 1672, a French fleet from Trincomalee, under the command of M. de la Haye, unexpectedly landed 300 men and some guns, and took St. Thome's by storm. They afterwards successfully resisted the numerous forces which the natives brought against them; but, in 1674, were compelled to surrender it to the Dutch, who gave it up to the King of Golconda.\n\nIn 1749 this town was taken possession of by Admiral Boscawen, as he found the Roman Catholic inhabitants and priests conveyed intelligence to the French in Pondicherry. For many years the town belonged to the Nabobs of Arcot; but, after the death of Anwar ud Deen, seemed to belong to nobody; for there were no officers, either civil or military, acting with authority in the place. In the Carnatic wars it was taken possession of by the government of Madras, and has remained subject to that presidency ever since. (Orme, Fra Paolo, Bruce, &c.)\n\nSaipoor, (Shakipura).\u2014A town possessed by independent zemindars, in the province of Gundwana, district of Singhrowla, situated on the N. W. side of the Rhair River, 15 miles from the southern frontier of the Rhotas district, in Behar. Lat. 24\u00b0. 2'. N. Long. 82\u00b0. 50'. E.\n\nSakkar.\u2014A district in the Nizam's territories, in the province of Bejapoor, named by the Mahomedans Nusseritabad, and situated about the 17th degree of north latitude. This is a very fertile, well-watered district, being principally situated between the Rivers Krishna and Beemah, and partly intersected by the latter; but its produce or population by no means equal what it might attain under a better form of government. The portion of the district to the north of the Beemah is hilly, but not mountainous. The principal towns are Sakkar and Nusseritabad.\n\nSakkar.\u2014A town in the province of Bejapoor, situated on the north side of the Beemah River, 65 miles E. from the city of Bejapoor, and the capital of a district in the Nizam's dominions of the same name.\nLat. 17\u00b0. 4'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 38'. E.\n\nSalayr Isle.\u2014An island in the Eastern Seas, situated off the southern extremity of Celebes, about the 6th degree of south latitude. In length it may be estimated at 40 miles, by eight the average breadth. There are many smaller islands, which lie round and near Salayr, and belong to it; but of these only two are inhabited, Bonaraute and Calawe.\n\nThis island is mountainous and woody, yet better cultivated and peopled most of the eastern isles, the inhabitants also appearing to have attained to a superior stage of civilization. The principal produce is millet, which is the chief subsistence of the natives, and cultivated advantageously, each piece of ground being fenced in. Cotton is also raised in the same manner, from which coarse blue and white striped cloths are manufactured for internal consumption and exportation. The houses of the inhabitants are good, and the richer classes, in travelling, are carried in bamboo chairs over the hills, horses being used only in the level country. By Captain Forrest, in 1775, the inhabitants were computed at 60,000.\n\nThe Macassars, who had obtained possession of this island, made a cession of it to the King of Ternate, from whom it was wrested by the Dutch East India Company. In 1775 Salayr was governed by 14 native regents, who resorted once a year, in the month of October, to Fort Rotterdam, in Celebes, to perform the customary duties of vassalage to the Dutch, on whose part a junior merchant resided on Salayr, in a pallisadoed fort. (Stavorinus, Forrest, Captain Hunter, &c.)\n\nSalengore, (Salangor).\u2014A district in the Malay Peninsula, extending along the Straits of Malacca, and governed by a Mahommedan chief, who bears the title of Rajah.\n\nThe trade of this place chiefly centres in Prince of Wales' Island, which is at no great distance; but, after the ships for China have left that island, there is some trade to be collected. The Buggess praws import to Salangore pepper, cloves, wild nutmegs, wax, nutmeg oil, rattans, dammer, wood oil, &c. From a large river near to Salengore, named Burnam, great quantities of long rattans are brought. As, in most other Malay principalities, the prince, or sovereign, is the chief merchant, and monopolizes the trade, ships lying here in the river are secure from the attacks of pirates; but, in the roads, it is necessary to be on the alert against straggling praws, which are always roving about, and ready to take advantage of any inattention.\n\nThe Buggesses of Celebes have still a small settlement here, and, with a great majority of the inhabitants, profess the Mahommedan religion. Salengore being a genuine Malay state, the Malaya language is here spoken in its greatest purity. (Elmore, Marsden, Leyden, &c.)\n\nSalibabo Isles.\u2014A cluster of islands in the Eastern Seas, situated about the fourth degree of north latitude, and between the 126th and 127th of east longitude. The names of the principal islands are Tulour (or Kercolang), Salibabo, and Kabruang\u2014the first being much the largest. The Island of Salibabo lies to the south of Tulour, from which it is divided by a narrow strait about one mile in the breadth, the circumference of the island being about 15 miles.\n\nAll these islands are well cultivated and populous, having plenty of provisions, such as calavanes, potatoes, rice, goats, hogs, &c. The inhabitants are of the Malay colour, with long hair, and have for arms lances, swords, targets, and daggers. They are much oppressed by their kolanos, or chiefs, and sold as slaves for trifling offences. The inhabitants of Salibabo Island are very frequently at war with those of Kabruang, distant five or six miles,\nThey barter provisions with such ships as pass for coarse calicoes, red handkerchiefs, coarse cutlery, &c. (Forrest, &c.)\n\nSallawatty.\u2014One of the Papuan or oriental Negro Isles, situated about the 131st degree of east longitude, and separated from the Island of Papua, or New Guinea, by a narrow strait. In length it may be estimated at 30 miles, by 25 the average breadth. This island produces a great deal of sago of an excellent quality.\n\nIn 1770 a fleet of Papuan boats sailed up the Straits of Patentia, which separate Batchian from Gi-lolo, on a plundering expedition; but the Dutch took the Rajah of Salwatty prisoner, and banished him to the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nSalianah, (Salheyan).\u2014A town in Northern Hindostan, tributary to the Goorkhali Rajah of Nepaul. Lat. 29\u00b0. 2'. N. Long. 81\u00b0. 37'. E.\n\nSallee, (Sali).\u2014A town in the province of Gujrat, situated on the north side of the Mahy River, 38 miles E. by N. from Cambay. Lat. 22\u00b0. 27'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 20'. E.\n\nSaloon, (Salavan).\u2014A town in the Nabob's territories, in the province of Oude, 65 miles S. S. E. from Lucknow. Lat. 26\u00b0. 2'. N. Long. 81\u00b0. 24'. E.\n\nSaloor.\u2014A town in the Northern Circars, 53 miles N. W. from Vizagapatam. Lat. 18\u00b0. 26'. N. Long. 83\u00b0. 19'. E.\n\nSalsette Isle.\u2014An island on the west coast of India, in the province of Aurungabad, and formerly separated from Bombay by a narrow strait, about 200 yards across, opposite to the fort of Taannah. In length it may be estimated at 18 miles, by 14 the average breadth.\n\nThe soil of this island is well adapted for the cultivation of indigo, sugar, cotton, flax, and hemp; but it most unaccountably remains in a desolate uncultivated state, and almost wholly covered with jungle, although in the vicinity of so rich a market as Bombay. This circumstance, however, has not the same tendency to promote improvement in India that it has in Europe, the most savage part of Bengal being within 20 miles of Calcutta, and wholly uninhabited. The Island of Salsette is consequently still more unhealthy than Bombay, the jungle being thicker, and the vallies more shut in. At present it scarcely produces the 100th part of what it might supply, and is in proportion thinly inhabited.\n\nThe most substantial improvement that has yet taken place with respect to this island, is the causeway which connects it with Bombay, completed by Mr. Duncan in 1805, although it is said to have had a prejudicial effect on the harbour of Bombay. A guard is constantly kept at the causeway, to prevent the introduction of contraband articles; for Salsette, although under the British government, is still subject to the Maharatta regulations, as far as regards taxes. The acquisition of this island was expected to have proved a much greater advantage to Bombay than it has turned out; and, on account of the slow progress of its improvement, it has been proposed to colonize it with Chinese.\n\nNotwithstanding its present desolate condition, Salsette is remarkably rich in mythological antiquities, and the remains of tanks, terraces, and flights of steps around them, indicate a former state of prosperity, and the collection of a considerable population. At Kemeri, on this island, there are several very extraordinary caverns excavated; the largest resembles that at Carli, but is inferior in size and elegance. Its peculiar ornaments are two gigantic figures of Buddha, nearly 20 feet high, and each filling one side of the vestibule. They are exactly alike, and are in perfect preservation, in consequence of their having been adopted and red painted by the Portuguese, who transformed the temple of Buddha into a Christian church. On the sea coast, above high water mark, extensive\nenclosures are levelled, and divided into partitions of about 20 feet square, which are filled by the overflowing of the sea, and contain six or eight inches of water. Before the next spring tide, all the fluidity is exhaled by the heat of the sun, and the salt is gathered from the bottom of the enclosure, and afterwards further refined. A little salt of a superior kind is procured at the time of the exhalation, by fixing a jagged piece of stick in the water, when first let into the reservoirs, to which, as the water evaporates, saline particles adhere, to the weight of three or four ounces. The finest kind of salt, used in the west of India for the table, comes from Arabia, in pieces not unlike a cheese in shape, and sparkling in appearance like a sugar-loaf.\n\nThis island, named by Europeans Salsette, is by the natives called Jhalta, or Shaster, the derivation of which is uncertain. It was long possessed by the Portuguese, but was wrested from them by the Maharattas, about 1750. In 1773, during a rupture with that nation, the Company's troops obtained possession of it, and it was formally ceded by the Maharattas, at the treaty of Poorbunder, in 1776, subsequently confirmed at the peace of 1782-3, when all the small islands in the gulf formed by Bombay and Salsette were also ceded. (Lord Valentia, Malcolm, Moor, H. Graham, Rennel, &c.)\n\nSamanan.\u2014A town possessed by native chiefs in alliance with the British, 122 miles N. W. from Delhi. Lat. 30\u00b0. 2'. N.

E.\n\nSamanaap is a considerable village, inhabited by one third Chinese and two thirds Malays, the latter having mosques, and the former temples and attendant priests. (Tomb\u00e9, &c.)\n\nSamar Isle.\u2014One of the Philippines, situated south east from the large island of Luzon, from which it is separated by a strait about five leagues in breadth. In length it may be estimated at 140 miles, by 60 the average breadth.\n\nThe soil of this island is extremely fertile, and cultivated with little trouble. Besides other grain, the native Bisayans raise a considerable quantity of rice, which is wholly appropriated to the use of the parochial clergy, or of the settlement at Manilla. The food of the natives consists chiefly of a species of potatoe, yams, and a root named gaby. The sugar-cane, cabbages, garlic, onions, melons, the china orange, lemons, vegetables, and several fruits not common in India, are cultivated here, particularly figs, of which there are many different species. Pepper, honey, and wax are found in the woods, which swarm with birds, and among others the domestic fowl. In these woods, also, there are many kinds of monkeys, some of them remarkably large, deer, wild buffaloes, and other quadrupeds. The iron tree, ebony, and dying woods, grow in every part of the island, and gold-dust is found in the interior.\n\nThe natives of Samar are Bisayans; such as reside on the sea-coast were formerly Mahomedans, but have been converted by the missionary jesuits to the religion and allegiance of Spain. Their houses are constructed of bamboos, and raised a few feet from the ground, to admit of a circulation of air underneath, and the natives generally are lodged, fed, and clothed, with very little trouble or expense. The streams are everywhere shaded by the bamboo, and the woods contain creeping plants and rattans, which supply the place of nails in a Bisayan's dwelling. Cotton and the fibres of the banyan fig-tree furnish materials for the scanty apparel he requires. They\npriests exercise over them a patriarchal authority, which is in general cheerfully submitted to. Advice and admonition on their part is always accompanied with some small present of wine, medicines, liquor, or animal food, which influences the Indian to an industry he would not otherwise exert. When punishment is necessary it is promptly inflicted, which the priest is enabled to do by acting in a military as well as sacerdotal capacity. In his own parish it is competent to each missionary to issue orders for building or repairing the fort, for providing it with cannon and ammunition, and for the construction of war canoes, which he frequently commands in person. The instrument mostly used, both for the purposes of war and industry, is a species of creese somewhat different from that of the Malays. The galleon always touches here on the passage from Acapulco to Manila, which attracts the Indians from the neighbouring islands. (La Page, &c. &c.)\n\nSamarang.\u2014A fortified town on the north east coast of Java, the capital of a large district, and ranking in importance next to Batavia. Lat. 6\u00b0. 54'. S. Long. 110\u00b0. 38'. E.\n\nThe sea coast ceded to the Dutch East India Company, and attached to the government of Samarang, extended from Oclopampang to Tagal in the west; the breadth inland is various, penetrating further up the country at one place than another. The whole was divided into nine residences; viz. Oclopampang, Sourabhaya, Gressec, Samanap (on the Island of Madura), Rembang Joana, Japara, Samarang, Pacatonga, and Tagal.\n\nThe town of Samarang is only 60 miles distant from the residence of the Emperor of Mataram, and 105 from that of the Sultan of Joueki, the two greatest potentates in the island. It is intersected by a river; but the shoalness of the coast is such that ships of burthen cannot anchor nearer to the shore than one and a half leagues, nor can the river be entered at all before half flood; and here, as along the north coast of Java generally, the tide rises but once in 24 hours. One mile east of Samarang River is that of Caligawa; both of them being navigable for small boats a short distance up the country, and having their sources among the Mataram mountains. On the banks of these rivers numerous campongs of Chinese and Javanese are scattered.\n\nSamarang is surrounded by a wall and ditch, possesses a good hospital and a public school, chiefly for the teaching of the mathematics, and there is also a theatre here. The houses occupied by Europeans are mostly built of small stones. The surrounding country being extremely fertile provisions are remarkably cheap, and generally of a good quality. At this place resides the governor of Java (as distinguished from Batavia), his authority extending from Cheribon to the eastern extremity of the island. He is appointed by the high regency, and is subordinate to the governor-general at Batavia; but the establishment is one of the most important in Java. All the communications with the empires of Mataram and Joueki, besides other Javanese kingdoms and principalities, centre here; and it is likewise the general depot of this quarter of the island, which produces large quantities of rice, sugar, coffee, and pepper. A great proportion of the vessels that fill the magazine at Batavia touch here. The government of Samarang is in consequence one of the most lucrative under the Dutch East India Company, surpassed only by that of governor-general. The appointment is generally changed every year, and is reserved for the counsellors of India, who are not rich, or who have lost their property, to enable them to realize a fortune.\n\nOn a steep rock, three quarters of a mile behind Bodijon, from a bamboo observatory, all the adjacent coast, mountains, and rivers, are per-\nceptible; and, on the same height, at a short distance from the observatory, are several tombs of deceased Javanese princes, surrounded by walls built of small stones. (Tombe, Stavorinus, Bligh, &c.)\n\nSambah, (Sambhu).\u2014A town in the Seik territories, in the province of Lahore, situated on the east side of the small River Deeg, 55 miles N.N.E. from the city of Lahore.

Lat. 1\u00b0. 3'. N. Long. 109\u00b0. 25'. E.\n\nOn account of the piracies committed by the inhabitants, this place was attacked by the British in 1812; but they were repulsed with considerable loss, and suffered still more by the pestilential effects of the climate. In 1813 a second expedition was fitted out against it, which proved completely successful.

Near to this town is a salt lake, about 13 miles long, by two broad, from whence great part of Hindostan is still supplied with salt, and from whence, during the Mogul government, it was carried as far as Benares and Bahar. (J. Grant, \u00a7c. &c.)\n\nSamboangan.\u2014A Spanish settlement on the S.W. extremity of the Island of Magindanao. Lat. 6\u00b0. 45'. N. Long. 122\u00b0. 10'. E. The town of Samboangan is situated on the banks of a small rivulet which flows into the sea. The number of inhabitants are about 1000; among which are included the officers, soldiers, and their respective families. In its environs are several small look-out houses, erected on posts 12 feet high, in all of which a constant guard is kept against the hostilities of the natives, with whom the Spaniards are in a state of perpetual hostility. The fort is very indifferent as a place of defence, and in a state of rapid decay. The houses are erected on posts, built of bamboos, and covered with mats; and the Spanish inhabitants, in place of attempting to improve the natives in the arts and conveniencies of life, are insensibly sinking into the manners and customs of the very people whom they affect to despise. The only edifice of note is the church, which in a Spanish settlement is always good; it is built of stone.\n\nThe military force at Samboangan consists of from 150 to 260 soldiers, natives of Manilla, and are generally as defective in discipline as the fort is in strength. This place is the Botany Bay of the Philippines, particular crimes being punished by banishment to this place; the conduct of the inhabitants is, however, much better than this circumstance would indicate, which is in a great measure owing to the exertions of the priests settled among them. The navigators who have accidently called here have been surprised to find the inhabitants, both of Spanish extraction and natives, so well acquainted with European music, particularly Handel's and country dances, which are here performed on violins, bassoons, and flutes, the orchestra being composed of natives of the island. For this they are also indebted to the priests, who have likewise taught them to dance\u2014a species of agility extremely repugnant to an Asiatic disposition.\n\nThe country adjacent to Samboangan is fertile, and the cattle have multiplied so greatly as to be of little value. At this place the Spaniards stop the Chinese junks bound to the eastward. The anchorage before the fort is foul and rocky, but abreast of the town it is better. The Spaniards and their subjects here are much infested by piratical prows, which plunder and cut off vessels richly laden while lying in the harbour, and frequently make descents\nclose to the fort, and carry off the inhabitants, whom they sell into slavery.\n\nAbout the year 1755 this fortress was nearly captured by the Sooloos by the following stratagem: One of their sultans, Ameer ul Momenin, came with a numerous retinue to Sambangan under pretence of being converted; but the plot was discovered, and the sultan with his family sent prisoners to Manilla, where they remained until the capture of that place by the British in 1762, when they were liberated. (Mears, Forrest, Somerret, &c.)\n\nSamgaum, (Syamagrama).\u2014A town in the Northern Carnatic, situated on the north side of the Pennar River, 17 miles W. N. W. from Nellore. Lat. 14\u00b0. 33'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 44'. E.\n\nSamrongur, (Semroon and Ghursemrow).\u2014An ancient and extensive city a few miles south of Bharcl, in the Terriani of Nepaul, of which the ruins only now remain. Lat. 26\u00b0. 45'. N. Long. 85\u00b0. 30'. E. In this district are also the ruins of a very large tank, named Bundar Pokrah, which, although useless and neglected, indicates that this part of the country, at present overgrown with forest trees, was formerly better populated, and in a more flourishing condition. The ruins of Semroon are situated between the Bukkia and the Junna River. (Kirkpatrick, &c.)\n\nSancor.\u2014A village tributary to the Ghoorkhali Rajah of Nepaul, in the province of Serinagar, consisting of from 40 to 50 houses. Lat. 30\u00b0. 10'. N. Long. 71\u00b0. 33'. E. The lands in the vicinity of this place are well cultivated, and were always noted for their fertility. Formerly a trade subsisted with the Bootaners, who purchased grain and left wool in exchange. In the surrounding forests are oak, atis, and paugar trees. Many of the inhabitants are affected with large tumours in the neck. (Raper, &c.)\n\nSandakan.\u2014A bay and harbour in the Island of Borneo, district of Mangeedara. This place abounds with baat, and opposite to it there is an assemblage of islands, the most easterly of which is remarkable for the great plenty of green turtle. The tortoise-shell is also found here. (Dalrymple, &c.)\n\nSanda.\u2014A town in the province of Sinde, situated on the south bank of the Goonoe River, on the route from Hyderabad, the capital of Sinde, to Luckput Bunder, and afterwards to Mandavee, on the Gulf of Cutch. Lat. 25\u00b0. 6'. N.\n\nThis is a large and populous town, and the country near it is well cultivated. The Goonoe is here, in the month of August, 160 yards broad, and one and a half deep.\n\nSandelwood Isle.\u2014A large island in the Eastern Seas, situated to the south of the Island of Floris, about the 10th degree of north latitude. In length it may be estimated at 100 miles, by 30 the average breadth; but it has never been explored, and nothing is known respecting it, nor how it acquired its present name.\n\nSandy.\u2014A town belonging to the Nabob of Oude, district of Khyrabad, 25 miles S. E. from Furruckabad. Lat. 27\u00b0. 18'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 58'. E.\n\nThe country immediately to the north of this place is extremely barren and sandy, there being tracts of it without a tree or shrub to shade the arid soil. The land is covered with dust by the wind, which in the cold season generally blows from 10 to 12 every day. The surrounding country has a bleak, dreary, and desolate appearance. The troops, while marching through it, sink deep in the light sand every footstep, and are blinded by clouds of dust. In the vicinity of this place is a large lake, which in most seasons of the year is covered with water-fowl. (Tennent, &c.)\n\nSandy Desert.\u2014An extensive tract of country thus named in the maps, having the province of Cutch to the south; Gujrat to the east; Sinde to the west; and Ajmeer to the\nThis region has not been recently explored by any European; but from the testimonies of the natives collected on the eastern border, there is reason to believe it is by no means a completely barren wilderness like the deserts of Arabia. On the contrary, although the country in general consists of an arid, unproductive sand, yet it contains many cultivated spots, and is interspersed with petty chiefships and stationary tribes.\n\nThe most powerful of these are the Balloochee Kosahs, who settled in the country about 27 years ago, and are named Siryes by the aborigines of the country. They are a race of sanguinary thieves, who infest the whole of the Parkur district, and extend their ravages into the Joudpour territories. They are armed with swords, and in general well mounted. They move in numbers from 100 to 500, which force is sufficient to overcome any that the country can collect at a short notice, and by some achievements of desperate valour they have inspired the natives with great terror.\n\nTheir dress and manner resemble those of the Sindeans. They never cut their hair; but, having let it grow to a great length, tie it in a knot on the top of their heads. There are 12,000 Baloochees scattered over Dhat, Parkur, and Neyer, or that tract of land marked as a desert in the maps. They acknowledge no superior, and subsist by their horses and swords, entering into the service of the different predatory chieftains. Being originally from Sinde they retain a great affection for their native country, and when one of them dies his remains are conveyed for interment to that province.\n\nThe River Loonee, which comes from Marwar, runs through the Gurrah district, and is said to fall into the Run, which bounds Cutch to the north. It is represented as a small stream, dry in the cold season of the year, with very low banks. The route across this tract of country from Rahdunpoor has been described as follows:\n\n| To Bhelcote | - - - - - - - 3 |\n| To Sonete   | - - - - - - - 4 |\n| To Morrwarra| - - - - - - - 4 |\n| To Soseegan | - - - - - - - 5 |\n| To the bank of the Run | - - - - - - - 2 |\n| To the opposite bank | - - - - - - - 16 |\n| To Bherranna | - - - - - - - 2 |\n| To Weerawow | - - - - - - - 8 |\n| To Nuggur Parkur | - - - - - - - 6 |\n\nThe road is said to be good the whole way. The Run in this quarter is represented to be a waste sandy tract, destitute of fresh water and vegetation; and, in the journey across it, there is no halting place for the whole 16 coss, on account of the total want of drinkable water. Brackish water is found on a tract about six coss in circumference, called Nurrah, situated on the Run, and covered with jungle, which serves as an asylum for thieves. This space is uninhabited and uncultivated, the soil being the same as that of the Run; yet the water, such as it is, is found very near the surface. Sooee-gaum stands near the Run, which comes from Arrisur in Wagur, and takes a sweep round Cutch. On crossing the Run the district of Parkur commences.\n\nFrom Parreennugger, 30 coss west, is situated Islannagur, in which distance the traveller experiences much difficulty from the sand hills, heat, glare, and want of water, the wells being eight or 10 coss distant from each other, and very deep; their appearance indicates a considerable duration. Between the two towns above mentioned there are no regular villages, but the Wandyas and Nyras are to be met with in the vicinity of the wells. There are two migratory hordes, who pasture flocks of goats, cows, and camels, as the season suits, and are by caste Soda Rajpoots, but are of late much mixed with Sindean Mahommedans. All\nover this sandy tract, scattered jungle and coarse vegetation of different sorts supply the cattle with food.\n\nBajeree and Moong are the only grains produced, and these only in spots where the sandy soil is a little mixed with clay. Ghee, the produce of their numerous flocks, finds a ready market throughout the whole of Cutch, and principally at Luckput Bunder. The natives eat goat's flesh, and have vegetables of various kinds. Water-melons of an excellent kind are produced throughout this parched and arid region, and furnish a most grateful refreshment.\n\nIslamnagur is described as a strong fort, situated in the desert, and destitute of water without the walls. It is upheld by the Sindean chief, Meer Gholaum Ali, as part of a chain of communication across the desert. Twelve coss, in a north-westward direction from Islamnagur, is the fort of Meittah, and 14 coss further that of Kherpoor\u2014both resembling Islamnagur, and the last only 35 coss from Hyderabad, the capital of Sinde.\n\nThe country north from Parkur, towards Amercote, is called Dhat, and was originally subject to the Soda Rajah of Amercote. According to the report of the natives, the distance from Parkur to Weerawow, N.W. is\n\n| Coss. | Parkur to Weerawow, N.W. |\n|------|-------------------------|\n|      |                         |\n| Rajora, N. | - - - 22 |\n| Koana, N.W. | - - - 8 |\n| Guddra, N.W. | - - - 20 |\n| Neelwa, N. | - - - 8 |\n| Amercote, N.W. | - - - 15 |\n\nBetween Weerawow and Rajora there is said to be one well, hills of sand, and jungle. At Koanna a well, and at Guddra a tank; the latter being the property of a Soda Rajpoot originally from Amercote. Between Koanna and Guddra there are two or three wells; and from Guddra to Neelwa sand hills and one well. Neelwa belongs half to the Soda, and half to the Rhatore Rajpoots. There are three forts in this tract, Kudha, Bulliaree, and Meitu, which lie to the westward of the above route, and are garrisoned by Sindean detachments. This part of the country exhibits little or no cultivation; the inhabitants subsisting on the produce of their numerous flocks of cattle and camels, which are purchased at a low price, and exported to Gujrat.\n\nThe district of Dhat includes a subdivision named Raree Rawar, situated immediately on the west border of Marwar, and inhabited solely by Rhatore Rajpoots. The natives of Dhat are described as pacifically inclined, possessing few horses, and armed with swords only. They are in consequence compelled to support the Sindean detachments, to preserve them from the depredations of the Kosahs and other Sindean plunderers, who devastate the country. (Macmurdo, &c.)\n\nSanding Isles, (Pulo Sanding).\u2014Two small islands situated off the S.W. coast of Sumatra, near the south-eastern extremity of the Nassau or Poggy Isles, in which group they are sometimes included. They are both inhabited, and their only remarkable production is the long nutmeg, which grows wild on them; and some good timber, particularly of the kind known by the name of marhaw. An officer and a few men were landed here in 1769, with a view to the establishment of a settlement, and remained a few months, during which time it rained without cessation. The scheme was subsequently abandoned as unlikely to answer any useful purpose. (Marsden, &c.)\n\nSangamsere, (Sangamasara, the Confluence).\u2014A small town in the province of Bejapoor, district of Concan, situated on the banks of the Zyghur or Jaigur River. Lat. 17\u00b0. 11'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 15'. E. Here the troops from Bombay, intended to ascend to the Upper Carnatic by the Ambah Pass, are usually landed from boats, which can come nearly up to the town.\nSANGARA, (Sancura).\u2014A small town in the Nizam's territories, in the province of Nandere, situated at the junction of the Manzora with the River Godavery, 43 miles S.E. from the town of Nandere. Lat. 18\u00b0 49'. E. Long. 78\u00b0 12'. E.\n\nSANGAR.\u2014A town in the Maharratta territories, in the province of Malwah, situated in a plain surrounded by a range of low hills. Lat. 23\u00b0 50'. N. Long. 78\u00b0 50'. E. The country to the west is hilly, but the altitude is not great, covered with low jungle, and but little cultivated.\n\nSANGIR ISLE.\u2014An island in the Eastern Seas, situated between the third and fourth degrees of north latitude, and 125th and 126th of east longitude. In length it may be estimated at 30 miles, by 10 miles the average breadth; and it is surrounded by 46 smaller islands of various dimensions. From the sea the land appears high and well wooded; and the coast has better harbours, and is less dangerous from hidden rocks and shoals than most of the Eastern Islands. The country is well inhabited, and affords refreshments of various kinds, such as bullocks, hogs, goats, and poultry; and cocoa nuts are in such plenty, that an oil is expressed from them and exported. Spices are also procured, with which a trade is carried on to Magindanao.\n\nAbout the middle of the west coast of the island is the town, bay, and harbour of Taroona; opposite to which, on the east coast, is also a town and harbour called Tabookang, the harbour of which is sheltered by two islands. There are many other harbours towards the south end of this island, along the middle of which runs a ridge of high mountains, terminated to the northward by a lofty volcano, from which there was a great eruption in 1711.\n\nThis island was formerly under the influence of the Dutch, who had a small garrison here. They made many converts to Christianity by the exertions of missionaries, who preached in the Malay-tongue, and had subordinate black preachers, who also spoke the dialects of the country. The islands of Salibabo, Kabruang, and Nanusan, were formerly subject to Sangir, and afterwards came with it under the influence of the Dutch; but that nation kept no European garrison at Salibabo, or Leron. (Forrest, Mears, &c. &c.)\n\nSANGEBARAH, (Sambhara).\u2014A town tributary to the Maharratas, in the province of Gujrat, 112 miles N.W. from Ahmedabad. Lat. 23\u00b0 37'. N. Long. 74\u00b0 13'. E.\n\nSANGUR, (Sangghar).\u2014A town in the province of Allahabad, district of Bundelkund, 100 miles S.W. from Chatterpoor, tributary to the Maharratas. Lat. 23\u00b0 50'. N. Long. 78\u00b0 50'. E.\n\nSANJORE, (Sanjara).\u2014A Rajpoot town in the province of Ajmeer, district of Sarowy, situated on the east side of the River Bah, 115 miles W.S.W. from Odeypoor. Lat. 25\u00b0 3'. N. Long. 72\u00b0 16'. E.\n\nThe road betwixt this town and Theraud, on the north-western frontier of the Gujrat Province, is infested by predatory Baloochee banditti of the Kosah tribe, who render the road impassable without a large escort. This tract of country is under no general control or government, every village having an independent chief, who plunders wherever he hopes to meet with impunity.\n\nSanjore is at present subject to the Rajah of Joudpoor, who keeps a garrison stationed in it. This place is also named Sachore.\n\nSANORE, (Sivanur).\u2014See Shanoor.\n\nSANPOO RIVER.\u2014See Brahmapootra.\n\nSANYASHYGOTTA, (Sanyasighat).\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Rungpoor, situated on the east side of the Mahanada River, 78 miles N.W. from the town of Rungpoor. Lat. 26\u00b0 33'. N. Long. 88\u00b0 15'. E.\n\nSAPAROUA ISLE.\u2014One of the small Amboyna Isles, about 20 miles in\ncircumference. Lat. 3\u00b0. 40'. S. Long. 28\u00b0. 40'. E. This island, with that of Noussa Laut, formerly yielded to the Dutch East India Company one half of the whole cloves exported from the Amboyna government.\n\nSapata Isle, (Pulo Sapato).\u2014A small elevated barren island in the Eastern Seas, so named by the Portuguese from its resemblance to a shoe, which in their language Sapata means, joined with the Malay word Pulo, which signifies an island. In appearance from the sea it is nearly perpendicular, and white like the cliffs of Dover, with innumerable flocks of sea-fowl hovering and screaming over it. Lat. 10\u00b0. 4'. N. Long. 109\u00b0. 10'. E.\n\nSarangur, (Saranaghar, the Asylum).\u2014A town possessed by independent Goand chiefs, in the province of Gundwana, 14 miles S.W. from Bustar. Lat. 19\u00b0. 40'. N. Long. 82\u00b0. 26'. E.\n\nSarangpoor, (Swrangapura).\u2014A district in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Malwah, situated about the 24th degree of north latitude. Like the rest of the province this district is elevated and hilly; but, being intersected by numerous branches of the Sopra and Gilly Sinde rivers, is fertile and productive, when under proper cultivation and a tranquil government. The chief towns are Sarangpoor, Rajegur, and Sher.\n\nSarangpoor.\u2014A town in the province of Malwah, the capital of a district of the same name, and situated on the north side of the River Sopra, 55 miles N.E. from Oojain. Lat. 23\u00b0. 38'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 30'. E.\n\nSarpilly, (Swapalli).\u2014A town in the Carnatic, 13 miles south from the town of Nellore. Lat. 14\u00b0. 14'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 58'. E.\n\nSarhaut, (Srihant, an affluent Mart).\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Birbhum, 85 miles west from Moorshedabad. Lat. 24\u00b0. 14'. N. Long. 86\u00b0. 51'. E.\n\nSarjew River, (Sareyu).\u2014See Goggrail.\n\nSarmatta Isle.\u2014A small island in the Eastern Seas, about 30 miles in circumference, situated in Lat. 8\u00b0. 10'. S. Long. 129\u00b0. 15'. E.\n\nSarowy, (Sarui).\u2014A large district in the province of Ajmeer, situated principally between the 25th and 26th degrees of north latitude. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, this district is described as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Sirowhy, containing six mahals; revenue, 42,077,437 dams. This sircar furnishes 8000 cavalry, and 38,000 infantry.\"\n\nSarowy is possessed by different Rajpoot chiefs, tributary to the Rajah of Joudpoor, who has greatly extended his conquests in this quarter. The eastern quarter is hilly, but more productive than the western, which joins the desert, and is almost destitute of water, which can only be procured from very deep wells. This circumstance, added to the internal dissensions of the native chiefs, and the incursions of the wild predatory hordes in the vicinity, keep the country in a very inferior state of cultivation, and prevent the increase of the population, which is but thinly scattered over an extensive tract of country. From Abul Fazel's description, it would appear to have formerly existed in a more flourishing state than it at present exhibits. The chief rivers are the Bah and Banass, neither of which reach the sea; and the principal towns, Sarowy and Sanjore.\n\nSarowy.\u2014A town in the Rajpoot territories, in the province of Ajmeer, 44 miles west from Odeypoor, and the capital of a district of the same name. Lat. 25\u00b0. 32'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 26'. E.\n\nSarun, (Sarana, Asylum).\u2014A district in the province of Bahar, situated about the 26th degree of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by Goracpoor and Bettiah, and on the south by the Ganges; to the east it has Bettiah and Hajypoor, and on the west the Dewah, or Goggrah River. In 1784, according to Major Remmel's mensuration, Sarun and\nBettiah contained 5106 square miles, the revenue of which was 1,312,721 rupees. Of the above extent the district of Sarun separately comprehended 2560 square miles.\n\nThis district is one of the most prosperous for its dimensions of any in the Company's dominions. The land is well supplied with water from two large rivers, the Ganges and the Gunduck, besides numerous smaller streams; and the soil when cultivated yields abundantly all the richest productions of the east. The breed of cattle in this district are excellent, and the bullocks equal to the government standard for the ordnance department, in which respect they are only rivalled by those of Purneah. It is remarkable that the natives, in the districts immediately adjacent, should never have attempted to improve their own breed of cattle to the same degree of excellence. The saltpetre exported to Europe, and used by the inhabitants of Bengal and the south, is principally manufactured in this district, and in that of Hajypoor.\n\nIn 1801, in consequence of instructions from the Marquis Wellesley, then governor-general, the board of revenue in Bengal circulated various questions on statistical subjects to the collectors of the various districts. The result of their replies proved that Sarun contained 1,204,000 inhabitants, in the proportion of one Mahomedan to four Hindoos. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, this district is described as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Sarun, containing 17 mahals; measurement 229,052 beegals; revenue 16,172,004 dams. This sircar furnishes 1000 cavalry, and 50,000 infantry.\" (Colebrooke, J. Grant, Abul Fazel, &c.)\n\nSaseram, (Sisurama).\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, district of Rhotas, 34 miles south from Buxar. Lat. 25\u00b0. Long. 84\u00b0. 5'. E.\n\nShere Khan, the Afghan, who expelled the Emperor Humayoon (the father of Acber) from Hindostan, was buried here in a magnificent mausoleum, built in the middle of a great reservoir of water. The monument rises from the centre of the tank, which is about a mile in circumference, and bounded on each side by masonry; the descent to the water being by a flight of steps now in ruins. The dome and the rest of the building is of a fine grey stone, at present greatly discoloured by age and neglect. (Hodges, &c.)\n\nSasne, (Susani, Rule).\u2014A town and fort in the province of Agra, 38 miles N. N. E. from the city of Agra. Lat. 27\u00b0. 45'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 4'. E. The zemindar, being refractory, was expelled from this place in March, 1803, by the British forces, after a desperate resistance.\n\nSatangur, (Satuagar).\u2014A town in the Nizam's territories, in the province of Hyderabad, 55 miles N. by E. from the city of Hyderabad. Lat. 17\u00b0. 56'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 16'. E.\n\nSatarah.\u2014A strong hill fort and town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Bejapoor, 47 miles south from Poonah. Lat. 17\u00b0. 50'. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 3'. E. The name signifies seventeen, being the number of walls, towers, and gates, it was supposed to possess.\n\nThis place is situated about midway between the Krishna and the Toura, or Tourna Ghaut, and stands on the westernmost point of a hill, rising from a base of from seven to eight miles in length from east to west. The fortress is on the highest part of the hill, and has a narrow passage up to it, admitting only one person at a time.\n\nSatarah was taken from the sovereign of Bejapoor, in 1651, by Sevajee, the founder of the Maharatta empire; and here his descendants continue to be imprisoned by their nominal deputies the Peshwas. At present the representative of the Sevajee family is better known by the title of the Satarah Rajah, who, although possessed of no real power, has some occasional attentions paid him. The Peshwa, on succeeding to that office, receives the khehaut,\nor dress of investment, from his hand; and when he takes the field he must go through the formality of having an audience, to take leave of the Satarah Rajah. The country circumjacent to this fortress enjoys an exemption from Maharatta military depredations of all kinds; and whenever any chief enters the district attached to it, all ensigns of royalty are laid aside, and the nagara, or great drum of the empire, ceases to beat. Such are the marks of attention paid to the nominal head of this empire, who is, in other respects, a close prisoner on a very moderate allowance.\n\nThe present rajah was, a few years back, a private silliadar, or commandant of horse; but, being unfortunately of the blood of Sevajee, on the demise of his predecessor he was exalted from a state of happy obscurity to the splendid misery of a throne and prison.\n\nTravelling distance from Bombay 146 miles. (Tone, Moor, Remel, &c.)\n\nSATGONG, (Satgrana, the Seven Villages).\u2014This town is now an inconsiderable village on a small creek of the River Hooghly, about four miles to the N. W. of the town of Hooghly in Bengal. In 1566, and probably later, it was a large trading city, in which the European merchants had their factories for procuring the productions of Bengal, and at which period of time the Satgong River was capable of bearing small vessels. (Remel, &c.)\n\nSATIMANGALUM.\u2014A town in the northern district of the Coimbeetoor province, situated on the Bhawani River. Lat. 10\u00b0 28'. N. Long. 77\u00b0 26' E.\n\nThe fort at this place is large, and constructed of uncut stone, and has a garrison, but contains few houses. The pettah, or town, is scattered over the plain at some distance from the fort; and, in Hyder's time, contained 800 houses, which are now reduced to 600. In the town and neighbourhood coarse cotton goods are manufactured, from the cotton raised in the surrounding country. Here is a temple of considerable repute, dedicated to Vishnu.\n\nThe fort of Sattimaugalam is said to have been built about 200 years ago by Trimula Nayaka, a relation of the Madura rajahs, who governed this part of the country on behalf of his kinsman. About 50 years afterwards it became subject to Canterava Naras, the Rajah of Mysore. (F Buchanan, &c.)\n\nSATTARAM, (Sitarama).\u2014A town in the Mysore Rajah's territories, situated 20 miles south from Serinapatan. Lat. 12\u00b0 9'. N. Long. 76\u00b0 53' E.\n\nSUTTIAVERAM.\u2014A town on the sea-coast of the Northern Circars, 56 miles S. W. from Vizagapatam. Lat. 17\u00b0 15'. N. Long. 82\u00b0 45' E.\n\nSAUTGUR,(or Satghadam).\u2014A town in the province of Barrahmahal, among the Eastern Ghauts, 30 miles west from Vellore. Lat. 12\u00b0 58'. N. Long. 78\u00b0 54' E.\n\nThe situation of this place is picturesque, being surrounded with rocks covered, in part, with brushwood. The Nabob of the Carnatic has a garden here, which is considered the best in the country, and is let out to some Armenians at Madras. Like most eastern gardens, it is totally destitute of beauty. The trees are planted regularly, and water is conducted in small channels to the root of each. In this neighbourhood the agave Americana grows in great profusion. The surrounding hills are covered with large stones, among which grow many small trees and shrubs, and also a few tamarind and banyan trees of great age and size.\n\nThe pass or ghaut beyond this place, approaching the Mysore, has been widened and levelled since the conquest of that country by the British, and artillery can at present ascend with little difficulty; but the tranquillity of the whole south of India, now under the Madras Presidency, has rendered this road principally important for commercial purposes. (Lord Valentia, &c.)\nSAVENORE.\u2014See SHANOR.\n\nSAVENDROOG, (Swarnadurgu, the Golden Fortress).\u2014A strong hill fort in the Mysore Rajah's territories, 54 miles N. E. from Serinapatanam. Lat. 12\u00b0. 56'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 29'. E.\n\nThis fortress is surrounded by a forest of natural wood, or jungle, several miles in depth, thickened with clumps of planted bamboos, to render it as impenetrable as possible. It is impossible to invest or blockade Savendroog closely, the rock forming a base of eight or 10 miles in circumference, which, with the jungle and lesser hills that surround it, includes a circle of 20 miles. From this base it is reckoned to rise above half a mile in perpendicular height. The huge mountain has further the advantage of being divided above by a chasm, which separates the upper part into two hills, each with their defences forming two citadels, and capable of being maintained independent of the lower works. This stupendous fortress, so difficult to approach, is no less famed for its noxious atmosphere, occasioned by the surrounding hills and woods, than for its wonderful size and strength.\n\nSavendroog was besieged during the first war with Tippoo, in 1791, by the British troops, when, after breaching the outer wall, the troops advanced to the storm, Lord Cornwallis in person superintending the attack. On the appearance of the Europeans advancing, the garrison were seized with an unaccountable panic, and fled, and the breach was carried without meeting or even overtaking the enemy. The main body of the garrison endeavoured to gain the western hill, which had they effected, the siege must have recommenced; but a small party of the 52d and 71st pressed so hard upon them, that they entered the different barriers along with them, and gained possession of the top of the mountain. Above 100 of the enemy were killed on the western hill, and many fell down the precipices in attempting to escape from the assailants. Thus in less than an hour, in open day, this fortress, hitherto deemed impregnable, was stormed without the loss of a man, only one private soldier having been wounded in the assault.

E.\n\nAt this place is a remarkably large tank, about eight miles in length, by three in breadth, which has not been formed by excavation, like those in Bengal; but by shutting up with an artificial bank an opening between two natural ridges of ground. In the dry season the water is let out in small streams for cultivation, and it is said to be sufficient to supply the lands of 32 villages (should the rains fail), in which 5000 persons are employed in agricultural pursuits.\n\nSEADULY FORT, (Sadulla).\u2014A fort in Northern Hindostan, in the territories of the Nepaul Rajah, district of Moewanpoor. Lat. 27\u00b0. 13'. N. Long. 86\u00b0. 5'. E. The British forces penetrated thus far north in 1767, and took this fortress; but were soon obliged to evacuate it and retreat, by the pestilential effects of the climate.\n\nSEALKOTE.\u2014A small town in the Seik territories, in the province of Lahore, 65 miles north from the city of Lahore. Lat. 32\u00b0. 44'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 58'. E.\n\nSEE BEEROO ISLE.\u2014An island off the west coast of Sumatra, situated principally between the first and second degree of south latitude, and the 98th and 99th of east longitude. In length it may be estimated at 70 miles, by 10 miles the average breadth.\n\nThis island is inhabited by the Mantawey race, and the inhabitants both of Si Pora and the Poggy Isles consider it as their parent country; but they are, notwithstanding, generally in a state of hostility. The inhabitants are distinguished only by\nsome variety of the patterns, in which their skins are tattooed. This island is rendered conspicuous from a distance by a volcano mountain.

E.\n\n**Sedhout, (Siddhavat).**\u2014A district in the Balaghaut ceded territories, situated principally between the 14th and 15th degrees of north latitude, and immediately within the Eastern Ghauts. Its surface is rocky and mountainous, and but indifferently cultivated, although many of the valleys are fertile. The eastern quarter continues much covered with jungle. It is intersected by the Penner, which is the chief river; the principal town is Odegherry.\n\nAbout A. D. 1650, the strong fortresses of Sedhout and Gunjicotta were taken by Meer Junula, who was then in the service of Sultan Abdallah, of the Kuttab Shahee dynasty of Golconda, or Hyderabad. At this era Sedhout, and the districts adjacent, were famous for the diamond mines, then very productive, but which in modern times have ceased to be so.\n\n**Seeassee Isle.**\u2014A small island in the Eastern Seas, one of the Sooloo Archipelago. It is a high island well wooded, but cleared in many places and inhabited, and supplied with water. It yields many cowries and small baat, named Seeassee.\n\n**Seebah, (Siva).**\u2014A small, hilly, and woody district in the Seik territories, in the province of Lahore, situated between the 31st and 32d degree of north latitude.\n\n**Seebah.\u2014**A town in the province of Lahore, situated on the brink of a rivulet and fortified, 100 miles E. by S. from the city of Lahore.

E.\n\nThis place is situated on the banks of the little River Rootah Seelin, and is surrounded by a large grove of mango and other trees. The soil adjacent is a black mould, but not much cultivated. Here is a considerable manufactory of striped and checkered muslins. (Hunter, &c.)\n\n**Seerdhuna.\u2014**A town in the province of Delhi, district of Meerut, 37 miles N. N. E. from the city of Delhi. Lat. 29\u00b0. 11'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 28'. E.\n\nThis place was formerly the residence of Somroo Beguni, and the capital of a small principality under her government, about 20 miles long, by 12 in breadth, which, with the town, were assigned by Nujill Khan to Somroo; and, on his death in 1776, were delivered over to his widow, the Begum Somroo, on condition of her keeping up a force of three battalions of infantry. This small district produces grain of all kinds, cotton, sugar, and tobacco; and during the winter season the air is cooled by breezes from the northern mountains, which are visible from hence. While it existed as an independent state there were here a good arsenal and foundry for cannon, but they are long gone to decay.\n\nSomroo's real name was Walter Reinhard, born of obscure parents in the Electorate of Treves, from whence he entered early into the\nFrench service, taking the name of Summer, which the natives of Hindostan pronounced Somroo. He came afterwards to Bengal, and entered a Swiss corps in Calcutta, from which, in 18 days, he deserted to the French at Chandernagore. He again deserted and fled to the upper provinces, and served some time as a private trooper in the cavalry of Sefdar Jung, the father of Sujah ud Dowlah. This service he quitted; and, after wandering about for some time, at length entered the service of Gregory, an Armenian, then high in favour with Cossim Ali, the Nabob of Bengal.\n\nIn this station, in 1763, he massacred the English captives at Patna. He afterwards deserted Cossim Ali, and successively served Sujah ud Dowlah, the Jaut Rajah Jawahir Singh, the Rajah of Jeynagur, and again the Jaut Rajah, whom he quitted once more for Nujiff Khan, in whose service he died in 1776. His corps of infantry was continued after his death, in the name of his son and a favourite concubine, named Zeb ul Nissa Begum, but better known in Hindostan by that of Somroo Begum.\n\nIn 1798 this lady was about 45 years of age, of small stature, and fair complexion. She frequently admitted to her table the higher ranks of her European officers, where they were waited on by female attendants, mostly Christians. In other respects she always exacted from her subjects and attendants the most rigid attention to the customs of Hindostan, and never herself appeared in public.\n\nIn 1807 this lady resided at Delhi, under the protection of the British government, having invested her property, which is still considerable, in the East India Company's funds at Calcutta.

A station was then established by the Chinese, and a guard left in charge of it, who were thus put in possession of a military post immediately adjoining the dominions of the East India Company in Bengal.

E.\n\nSera, (Sirra).\u2014A town in the Rajah of Mysore's territories, 84 miles N. from Serinapatan. Lat. 13\u00b0. 37'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 55'. E.\n\nThe climate in this district is such, that there seldom falls as much rain as is required to raise a full crop. In favourable years the greater part of the watered land is sown with rice; but, in dry seasons, a little only of this grain is raised, and the cultivation chiefly consists of transplanted raggy, wheat, jola, and navony, which articles require less water. The merchants of Sera trade with the Nizam's country, the Maharratas, and to Bedmore, Serinapatan, and Bangaloor. The grand article for exportation here is copra, or dried kernel of the cocoa nut.\n\nThis place was first conquered by the Bejapoor Mahommadan government in 1644, and was afterwards, for a short time, the seat of an independent principality, which ruled a considerable extent of country, and was, at its greatest prosperity, under Dilawar Khan, immediately before it was conquered by Hyder, at which time the natives assert it to have contained 50,000 houses. Since that period it has suffered many calamities from Tippoo and the Maharratas, and now scarcely contains 3000 houses, but is fast reviving.\n\nIn the vicinity of Sera all the villages were strongly fortified, when it was conquered by the British. Prior to this event, the district experienced frequent famines, during which the inhabitants were in the practice of plundering each other to support life. In war also they found these fortifications, however feeble against ordnance, sufficiently strong to repulse the irregular predatory cavalry, who seldom carried fire arms. In their defence of these villages, the inhabitants employed few weapons, except stones, which both men and women throw with great force, boldness, and dexterity. (F. Buchanun, Moor, &c.)\n\nSerampoor, (Sriramapura).\u2014A Danish settlement in the province of Bengal, situated on the west side of the Hooghly River, about 12 miles above Calcutta. Lat. 22\u00b0. 45'. N. Long. 88\u00b0. 26'. E.\n\nThe appearance of Serampoor has a pleasing effect viewed from the river, the houses being tolerably well built, and whitened, like those of Calcutta, with chunam. It extends above a mile along the banks of the Hooghly, but the breadth is very small, and the whole is environed by the British territories. The town is without fortifications, and has only a small battery for saluting; yet it has been a very profitable settlement to the subjects of his Danish Majesty, principally on account of the facilities it afforded to the Calcutta merchants of carrying on a trade during war, under the cover of the Danish flag. Ships of burthen cannot come close up to the town, on account of a shoal lower down; but labour in this province is so cheap, that the additional expense of conveying the goods by boats adds little to the prime cost. Here also, until hostilities commenced with Denmark, insolvent debtors from Calcutta found an asylum, from whence they could set their creditors at defiance.\n\nThis settlement is the head-quarters of the missionaries, delegated from Europe, for the purpose of converting the natives of Hindostan to the Christian religion; and here they have established a printing press, where the scriptures have been translated into a variety of dialects. The proficiency attained by these worthy men in the eastern languages is truly wonderful; they have mastered even the Chinese, hitherto the opprobrium of linguists. (Lord Valentia, &c.)\n\nSerampoor.\u2014A town in the pro-\nSerinagur, (Srinagar, the City of Abundance).\u2014A province in Northern Hindostan, situated principally between the 30th and 31st degrees of north latitude.\n\nThe modern limits of this province are marked by the Coadwara Ghaut on the south, computed 80 miles from the town of Serinagur. On the south-east it terminates at the village of Chiring, Lat. 30\u00b0 6'. N. Long. 79\u00b0 40'. E. one half of it being in the Kemaoon, and the other in the Serinagur district; on the north by Bhadrinath; and on the west by Beshaw. To the north lies the mountainous and unexplored province of Badryezram; on the south, the British territories in Oude and Delhi; on the east is the Goggrah and a ridge of high mountains; and on the west the River Jumna. In length it may be estimated at 140 miles, by 50 the average breadth.\n\nThe whole face of this country is an assemblage of hills jumbled together, in many forms and directions; sometimes in chains, lying parallel to each other, but of no great extent, and often connected at their termination by narrow ridges, running across the vallies at right angles. The summits of all are usually narrow, and of various shapes, and the distance betwixt each range short; the vallies, in consequence, are so confined, that, in many parts, it would be difficult to find a spot large enough to accommodate a corps of 1000 men. Some of these ranges are covered with trees, and always green; others are naked and stony, affording shelter for neither birds nor beasts. On the eastern borders of this province, among the lower ranges of mountains, are extensive forests of oak, holly, horse chestnut, and fir; and in this quarter beds of strawberries are seen, equalling in flavour those of Europe. From Lolldoug to the Ganges the country forms, with little interruption, a continued chain of woody hills. From the Ganges to the Jum-\nna, the road lies through an extensive valley of good soil, but thinly inhabited, and much interspersed with wood.\n\nIn these forests the elephant abounds, but greatly inferior in size and quality to the Chittagong elephant, on which account it is not domesticated. On the eastern borders there are hill pheasants among the mountains, but they keep near the summit, and seldom venture into the valleys, unless when compelled by heavy falls of snow. But a small part of this extensive district is either cultivated or populated, the wild animals being left in undisturbed possession of much the larger portion. The food of the inhabitants is wheaten bread and peas. In 1796, while Serinagur existed as an independent principality, the revenues were estimated at five lacks of rupees, which amount comprehended the duties on imports and exports, the produce of grain, &c. working the mines and washing for gold.\n\nThe other sources of revenue arose from the importation of rock salt and borax from Bootan, musk in pods, chowries, hawks, male and female, from the countries bordering on Bhardrinath. From the Oude province all kinds of cotton cloths are imported; and from Lahore considerable quantities of salt. In the mountainous part of this province both sheep and goats are employed as beasts of burthen. These animals are saddled with small bags, containing 12 pounds of grain, and are dispatched in flocks of 150 to 200, under the charge of two or three shepherds, with their dogs. A steady old ram, furnished with a bell, is fixed on for the leader. In the traffic to Bootan, where grain forms one of the principal articles of commerce, these creatures are found very serviceable for carriage; and on their return they bring back salt. The species of goat principally employed in this service is rather small, scarcely exceeding in size that of Bengal. The sheep are of the common species, but their wool attains a much greater length, and is used in the manufacture of coarse blankets.\n\nThe principal places where gold is said to be found are, Carnaprayaga, Paecenkoonda, Devaprayaga, Rickerease, and Lakherrighaut. At Nagpoor and Dhunpoor, to the N. and N. E. of the town of Serinagur, are two copper mines, the ore of which is said to produce 50 per cent. At Dessouly, a considerable distance to the east, there is a lead mine, and iron is produced in many parts of the country. Near Jaroehli Ghant, in the eastern quarter of the province, there is a quarry of very fine marble.\n\nThe ancient name of this province was Gerwal; and, while independent, the rajah's forces were estimated at 5000 men, armed with matchlocks, bows and arrows, and swords and shields, but without discipline. At the court of Nepaul a plan had long been in agitation to invade the Serinagur territories, and to extend the Ghoorkhali possessions to Cashmere. In 1791, after the reduction of Kemonoon and its dependencies, the Nepalese made an attempt to subdue the country of Gerwal; but the opposition they met with at the fort of Sangar, before which they were unsuccessfully detained 12 months, and the invasion of Nepaul by the Chinese Tartars, obliged them to postpone their project to a later period. From this date, however, the Serinagur Rajah became tributary to the Ghoorkhali dynasty; the sum at the commencement was only 3000 rupees, but gradually quadrupled.\n\nIn 1803 an army of 10,000 men marched from Nepaul to complete this conquest, and about half a mile to the north of the village of Gurudwara, the battle was fought which decided the contest between the Serinagur and Nepaul rajahs. The former was killed by a musket ball during the engagement, and his death spread general consternation through the country\u2014the inhabitants of which, forsaking their villages, fled to the mountains. The village of\nGurudwara was then pillaged, and the surrounding country remained uncultivated until next year, when Har Sewai Ram, the present mahaut, was reinstated in his possessions, and through his influence the peasantry were induced to return. The territories, which formerly belonged to the Rajah of Serinagur, are now divided into 84 pergunnahs, comprehended in three divisions, over each of which a military governor is appointed. The common mode of punishment is by levying a fine upon a pergunnah, village, or individual; and, in default of payment, the person, property, or family of the offender are seized.\n\nThe natives of Serinagur profess the Hindoo Brahminical religion, in the exercise of which they do not materially differ from the lower parts of Hindostan. (Raper, Hardwieche, Foster, &c.)\n\nSERINAGUR.\u2014A town in the province of Serinagur, or Gerwal, of which it is the capital. Lat. 30\u00b0. 11'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 15'. E.\n\nThe valley of Serinagur extends a mile and a half to the eastward, and the same distance to the westward of the town. The River Alacananda enters the valley near a village called Seerkote. Its course here is nearly from east to west, and the breadth of the channel, from bank to bank, about 250 yards; but in the dry season it does not exceed 80 or 100 yards. At the western extremity of the valley the current strikes with violence against the rocky base of the mountain, near to which it is crossed on a rope bridge, called a joolah, suspended across the river, here 80 yards broad, from posts erected on each side. From the appearance of the river, it is probable, that canoes or floats of timber might pass down at all seasons of the year. The aspect of the surrounding mountains is very barren, exhibiting a rocky, sterile soil, where the little vegetation that is produced is soon parched and dried up.\n\nThe town of Serinagur occupies nearly the centre of the valley, and is in length about three quarters of a mile, but much less in breadth, its form being elliptic. The houses are of stone, roughly and irregularly put together with common earth, generally raised to a second floor, and all covered with slate. They are so crowded together, as to leave little more space for the street than is sufficient for two persons to pass. The house of the former rajahs is in the middle of the town, and is the largest, being raised to a fourth story, and built of a coarse granite. The floors of the houses are occupied for shops, and the upper stories for the accommodation of families.\n\nThis town is now reduced to a very low state of poverty and insignificance. The encroachments annually made by the Alacananda, the earthquake of 1803, and the Nepalese invasion at the end of the same year, all combined to hasten its ruin; nor under its Ghoorkhali rulers is it likely to revive from its forlorn condition. The inhabitants consist chiefly of the descendants of emigrants from the Doab and province of Oude. The greater portion of them are Hindoos; the number of Mahommedan families not exceeding 60 or 70, most of whom are petty shopkeepers. The leading persons are the agents of the great banking houses at Nujibabad and in the Doab, who are employed in the sale and exchange of merchandize and coins. These persons reside here only eight months of the year, quitting the hills and returning to their houses at the commencement of the rainy season. The traffic in silver and specie forms one of the most profitable branches of commerce, and is carried on to a considerable amount.\n\nThe other articles of mercantile speculation are the produce of the hills, and the imports from Bootan. The former are a coarse hempen cloth, hemp, lead, copper, drugs, gums, wool, and a sort of flannel made of the wool. From Bootan\nare received chauris, or cow tails, musk in pods, saffron, borax, salt, drugs of different kinds, and a few shawls, which come by that circuitous route from Cashmere. Among the drugs is the curcuma zedoaria. Hawks are also brought down from the hills. In exchange for these commodities, the following articles are supplied from the low countries, viz. coarse cotton and woollen cloths, silk, spices, Lahore salt, sugar, and tobacco. On all these goods a duty is levied at Serinagur equal to eight per cent. The whole trade, however, of this capital is insignificant, as most of the above articles find an easier channel through the hills to the east, and by the town of Ahmora.\n\nOn the opposite side of the river, at the village of Ranilhaut, is a temple sacred to Rajah Ishwara, which is principally inhabited by dancing women. The initiation into this society is performed by anointing the head with oil taken from the lamp placed before the altar; by which act they make a formal abjuration of their parents and kindred, devoting their future lives to prostitution. Four-fifths of the inhabitants appear to suffer from the venereal disease; and the calamity is aggravated by their ignorance of the proper method of treating the distemper. (Reaper, Hardwicke, &c.)\n\nSERINGAPATAM, (Sri Ranga Patana).\u2014A city in the province of Mysore, of which it is the capital. Lat. 12\u00b0 26' N. Long. 76\u00b0 51' E.\n\nThis city is placed at the upper end of an island surrounded by the Cavery, which is here a large and rapid river, having a very extensive channel, impeded by rocks and fragments of granite. The Island of Seringapatam has been found, by actual survey, to be about four miles in length, by one and a half in breadth across the middle part of it, where the ground is also highest, and from thence slopes especially to the north.\n\nThe country in the vicinity rises gradually on both sides of the river; and, for some distance from the town, is finely watered by excellent canals, which, having been taken from the river, follow the windings of the hills; and, as they advance horizontally to the eastward, send off branches to water the intermediate space. The water is forced into the sources of these canals by dams thrown across the river, and formed of large blocks of granite; the whole being of prodigious strength, and executed at a vast expense.\n\nThe grounds in the neighbourhood of Seringapatam are of three sorts: viz. 1st. Wet land, or that watered artificially, and producing what are called wet crops, or grains. 2. Dry field, or that which receives no artificial supply of water, and which produces dry crops, or grains. 3. Gardens, or orchards. The watered grounds are formed into small terraces quite level, and surrounded by little raised banks for retaining the water when flooded. The farms in extent are generally two or three ploughs of land. With five ploughs a man can cultivate about 12\u00bd acres of watered land, and 25 acres of dry field. For the watered land he pays government at the rate of 23 rupees per acre, besides other charges for the gods, &c.; the government being bound to keep the tanks and canals in repair. The hire of farm labourers near Seringapatam is 6 rupees per month; in the country parts it is much cheaper.\n\nIn the Mysore province Seringapatam is commonly called Patana, or the city; but the name by which it is designated in the maps is a corruption of Sri Ranga Patana, or the City of Sri Ranga, an epithet of Vishnu, the preserving power. The fort occupies about a mile at the west end of the island, and is an immense, unfinished, injudicious mass of building. In fortifying this town Tippoo retained the long straight walls and square bastions of the Hindoos; and his glacis was in many parts so high and steep as to shelter the assailants. The pet-\ntah, or suburbs, is built on the middle and highest part of the island, and is about half a mile square.\n\nHyder's palace, named the Laul Baugh, occupies the east end of the island; and, although built of mud, displays considerable elegance, and is a very handsome native building. Adjoining is the mausoleum of Hyder, where rests all that was royal of this Mahommedan dynasty, consisting of Hyder himself, his wife, and Tippoo, who lie under tombs of black marble, elevated about 18 inches from the ground. These tombs are covered with rich cloths, at the expense of the British government, and the establishment of priests to offer up prayers, and of musicians to perform the nobut, is kept up as formerly. The palace in the city is a very large building, surrounded by a massy and lofty wall of stone and mud, and outwardly of a mean appearance\u2014a description applicable to every public edifice at Seringapatam. They are now greatly degraded from their former dignity. Hyder's palace is the residence of a surgeon; his seraglio a European hospital. Tippoo's seraglio is a barrack for artillery; his private apartments are occupied by the resident, and his public by the European troops. All these buildings have a very heavy appearance externally from the want of windows; and although considered excellent accommodation by the Mahommedan chiefs, are ill suited to Europeans, being close shut up and inconvenient. The streets also are very narrow and confused.\n\nIn 1800, according to the register of houses, the fort or city contained 4163 houses, and 5499 families; and the suburbs 2216 houses, and 3335 families. At five inhabitants to each house we may estimate the population of the city to be 20,815, and of the suburbs 11,080; in all 31,895 persons; independent of a strong garrison and its numerous followers. It is probable that, in Tippoo's reign, the Island of Seringapatam contained 150,000 inhabitants; but many have been attracted to the rajah's residence at the city of Mysore, and many Mahommedans, who originally came from the Lower Carnatic, since the destruction of Hyder's dynasty, have returned there. The manufactures of Seringapatam and its vicinity were never considerable, principally military stores and camp equipage. Timber is here very dear, being principally brought by land carriage from the Western Ghauts. Excellent meat and good vegetables are to be had here in abundance; but bread being dear, the European soldiers are obliged to eat rice.\n\nOn the night of the 6th Feb. 1792, Lord Cornwallis attacked Tippoo's fortified camp under the walls of Seringapatam, within a bound hedge strengthened by redoubts, and amounting to 40,000 infantry, besides a large body of cavalry. For this attack he selected 2800 Europeans, and 5900 native infantry, but without artillery. The attack was completely successful, and 80 guns were taken. The British loss was 585 men killed and wounded. The sultan's loss in the battle is said to have been 4000, but the desertion was so great after the overthrow, that his army was reduced in number at least 20,000. On the 24th February preliminaries of peace were settled with Tippoo, who relinquished half his dominions, and paid three crores and 30 lacks of rupees (about three and a half millions sterling) in bullion. Lord Cornwallis gave up to the troops his whole share of prize money, amounting to 47,244l. and General Meadows (the next in command) his, amounting to 14,997l. sterling.\n\nOn this occasion the force brought against the Mysore sovereign was one of the most formidable ever seen in Hindostan. On the 16th March, 1792, the British army above the Ghauts amounted in all to 11,000 Europeans, 31,600 natives, and 190 pieces of cannon. The Maharattas, the Nizams, the Rajah of Travancor,\nand the Coorg Rajah's forces, amounted to about 40,000 men, of whom 30,000 were cavalry. Towards the conclusion of the siege in 1792, allowing four camp followers to each soldier, the total number of persons attached to the camps of the confederates exceeded 400,000.\n\nThe bullocks attached to the army, and employed in bringing supplies, amounted to half a million, requiring one man for every three bullocks. There were several hundred elephants, and many thousand camels with their attendants. Every horse in the cavalry and in the army, besides the trooper, or rider, has two attendants, one who cleans and takes care of him, and the other the grass cutter, who provides his forage. The palanquin and litter carriers for the sick were a numerous class. Field officers, including the people who carry or have charge of their baggage, cannot have less than 40, captains 20, and subalterns 10 servants. The soldiers have a cook to each mess, and the sepoys, most of whom are married, have many of them, as well as their followers, their families in camp. The bazar people, or merchants, their servants, and adventurers who follow the army for the chance of plunder, are a great many. Early in the war some of the sepoys were prevailed on to send back their families, and arrangements were made to reduce the number of followers; but these measures tended to create desertion, and increase distress. While marching there are no towns to be depended on for supplies, and an army in India not only carries with it most of the means of subsistence for several months, but many articles of merchandise; the scene altogether resembling more the migration of a nation guarded by troops, than the advance of an army to subdue an enemy.\n\nIn 1799, war being again declared, Seringapatam was stormed on the 4th of May, about two o'clock in the afternoon, by the army under General Harris, the garrison then amounting to about 8000 men, of whom a great proportion were slain. Tippoo was killed under a gateway, probably by a party of the 12th regiment of foot; but this important event was not actually known until some time after it had happened. No individual ever appeared to claim the honour of having slain the sultan, nor was it ever discovered who had obtained possession of his valuable necklace of pearls. This sovereign had certainly considerable talents, but he wanted the prudence and common sense of his father, Hyder. He succeeded best in attaching to him the lower classes of Mahommedans, and he possessed all the cant, bigotry, and zeal necessary to effect this purpose. None of his Mahommedan soldiers entered the British service, although many suffered extreme poverty; and they still revere his memory, considering him as a martyr fallen in the defence of their religion. Among the arrangements consequent to the capture of Seringapatam, the British acquired permanent possession of the island, which now forms one of the collectorships under the Madras Presidency.\n\nTravelling distance from Madras, 290 miles; from Hyderabad, 406; from Poonah, 525; from Bombay, 622; from Nagpoor, 727; from Calcutta, 1170; and from Delhi, 1321 miles. (F. Buchanan, Dirom, Lord Valentia, Rennel, 5th Report, &c.)\n\nSeringham, (Shirangam).\u2014Opposite to Trichinopoly, in the Carnatic, the Cavery separates into two branches, and forms the Island of Seringham. About 13 miles to the eastward of the point of separation the branches again approach, but the northern one is at this place 20 feet lower than the southern. The northern branch is permitted to run waste to the sea, and is named the Coleroon; but the southern, which retains the name of the Cavery, is led into a variety of channels to irrigate the province of Tanjore. Near the east end of the Island of Sering-\nham is formed an immense mound, to prevent the waters of the Cavery from descending into the Coleroon.\n\nThe Seringham pagoda is situated about a mile from the western extremity of the island, at a small distance from the bank of the Coleroon. It is composed of seven square enclosures, one within the other, the walls of which are 25 feet high and four thick. These enclosures are 350 feet distant from one another, and each has four large gates with a high tower, which are placed in the middle of each side of the enclosure, and opposite to the four cardinal points. The outward wall is nearly four miles in circumference; and its gateway to the south is ornamented with pillars, several of which are single stones 33 feet long, and nearly five in diameter. Those which form the roof are still larger. In the innermost enclosures are the chapels.\n\nAbout half a mile to the east of Seringham, and nearer to the Cavery, is another large pagoda, named Jemibikisma, but this has only one enclosure. Pilgrims from all parts of Hindostan resort to Seringham for absolution, and none come without an offering of money. Here, as in all the great pagodas, the Brahmins live in a subordination that knows no resistance, and slumber in voluptuousness that feels no want. This repose does not appear to have been disturbed until the siege of Trichinopoly, which began about 1751, at which period the besiegers took possession of the island and pagoda of Seringham; but they never attempted to violate the inner enclosures of the temple, or to expose this Hindu sanctuary to greater pollutions than were absolutely necessary.\n\nThe French army here, in 1752, was compelled to surrender to Major Lawrence; at which time it consisted of 35 commissioned officers, 725 battalion men bearing arms, besides 60 sick and wounded in the hospital, and 2000 sepoys. Their artillery was four 13-inch mortars, eight coehorns, two petards, 31 pieces of cannon, besides a great quantity of ammunition and stores.

E.\n\nThis is a large open town, the appearance of which indicates a former state of prosperity and greater population than it at present contains. It is situated in a fine open country, well cultivated. The bazars are very strong, and are built of stone, on an elevation of four feet above the street. A large caravanserai still remains, having a double row of pillars, and walled all round. In 1809 the British army, when in pursuit of Ameer Khan, took possession of Scrouge, but only proceeded five miles further north, it being impossible to overtake him.\n\nThe country for many miles to the south of Seronge is an open plain; but the villages are mostly in ruins, from the frequent incursions of the pindaries (plunderers). The town and surrounding district were given by Holkar to Ameer Khan; and, about the year 1804, yielded him five lacks of rupees annually.\n\nTravelling distance from Oojain, 165 miles N.E.; from Agra, 253; from Benares, 389; from Bombay, 595; from Calcutta, by Benares, 849; and from Nagpoor, 295 miles.

E.\n\nDuring the reign of Sahoo Rajah, the Maharatta sovereign, Comaje Angria, the pirate, revolted; and having seduced one-half of the fleet to follow his fortune, with it he took and destroyed the remainder. He afterwards established his headquarters at this place, where he and his posterity governed until 1756, when it was taken by Commodore James in the Protector frigate, with scarcely any assistance from the Maharatta besieging army. (Orme, &c.)\n\nSewad.\u2014An Afghan district in the province of Cabul, situated about the 34th degree of north latitude, and in part bounded by the Indus. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, this district is described as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Sewad comprises three territories, viz. Bembher, Sewad, and Bijore. The Sewad division measures in length 40, and in breadth from five to 15 coss. On the east lies Bembher; on the north Kinore and Cashgur; on the south Beckram; and on the west Bijore. In the mountains of this country are several passes. The summer and winter are temperate. The mountains are covered with snow, but in the plains it melts in three or four days after the fall. Here are spring, autumn, and periodical rains as in Hindostan. Both the spring and autumn harvests are plentiful. Here are all the flowers of Tartary and Hindostan; violets, narcissuses, and a variety of fruits grow wild. The whole of this sircar consists of hills and wilds, and is inhabited by the tribe of Yusefzei.\"\n\nThe Yusefzei are the bravest and most powerful of all the Afghan tribes, and occupy the greater part of the extensive mountainous districts of Sewad, Bajawer (Bijore), Balheri, Duder, and Chechh Hazareh. These countries are all of great natural strength, and consist of ranges of lofty mountains divided by valleys, which are watered by mountain streams, and occasionally intersected by abrupt precipices. Sewad is about 70 miles in length, and 40 in breadth, and contains 25 valleys, each watered by its own stream. Pinjkora contains six valleys or glens, each of which is about 20 miles in length; and the district is roughly estimated at 50 miles in length, and not much less in breadth. Duder is about 40 miles in length, and not much less in breadth.\n\nThe original seat of the Yusefzei tribe was between Cabul and Ghizni; but, deserting this district about the time of Mirza Ulugh Beg, they conquered their present possessions from the native princes or sultans, who boasted a descent from Secunder Zulkarnein\u2014as many persons in the country still do, and produce in confirmation their genealogical tables. These persons form a separate tribe, named Secunderi; but, nevertheless, affect to be of Arabic origin. The countries possessed by the Yusefzei are in general well cultivated, and the tribe is very numerous. They never yielded more than a nominal obedience to any sovereign; but, being divided into a number of distinct clans, without any general head, they are much less formidable to their neighbours than they would otherwise be. They were chastised, on account of their depredations, by Acber; in 1670, by Au-rongzebe; and by Nadir Shah in 1739, during his return from Hindostan.\n\nSewad and Bijore are extremely mountainous, and abound with difficult passes and strong situations, so\nthat the inhabitants have not only held themselves independent of the Mogul sovereigns, but have occasionally made inroads into their territories. (Leyden, Abul Fazel, Renel, &c.)\n\n**Sewalic Mountains.** *(Sivalica).* \u2014 A chain of mountains of considerable altitude, that separate the province of Delhi from that of Serinagur in Northern Hindostan, and marks the termination of the vast plain through which the Ganges flows to the sea. The elevation is small compared with that of the great Himalaya ridge.\n\nAt the village of Coadwara, a few miles from the Lolldong Pass, these hills rise with a moderate though unequal slope from the plains below, and are skirted by deep forests. The soil of these forests varies from a fat black earth, where the trees and shrubs attain a great size, to a firm reddish clay, and mixtures of gravel and loose stone. Elephants abound in these forests, but they are greatly inferior in size and value to those caught nearer the sea. They seldom exceed seven feet in height, and are sold when first caught for two and 300 rupees each; but they are frequently merely caught for their teeth. (Hardwicke, Raper, &c.)\n\n**Sewan.** \u2014 A town in the province of Balhar, district of Sarun, 66 miles N.W. from Patna. Lat. 26\u00b0. 11'. N. Long. 84\u00b0. 25'. E. In this vicinity an inferior sort of crockery is made in imitation of Staffordshire ware, from a species of black potter's marle.\n\n**Sewee.** *(Sivi).* \u2014 A district in the province of Baloochistan, situated about the 31st degree of north latitude, and bounded on the east by a mountainous ridge of hard black stone. In modern times it has not been explored; but Abul Fazel, in 1582, relates, that \"near to Sewee there is a lake two days' journey in length, called Munjoor;\" upon the surface of which fishermen have formed artificial floating islands, where they reside and carry on their occupations.\"\n\n**Sewistan.** *(Sivastan).* \u2014 A large district, or rather province, in Baloochistan, of which it appears to comprehend the whole eastern quarter. It consists of a stupendous range of mountains, extending southwards from Candahar, and accessible only by passes of extreme difficulty. It is divided into the districts of Jhalawan to the southward, and Saharawan to the northward, which includes Noosky in the desert, and Moostung and Shal to the northward. Each of these districts is subdivided into nine Tuks or Zillabs, furnishing quotas of troops for service, but paying no tribute. The climate of Sewistan is dry, and from its great elevation excessively cold in winter. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows: \"Sircar Sewistan, containing nine mahals; revenue, 15,546,803 damis.\" (Christie, Kinneir, &c.)\n\n**Seysumar.** \u2014 A town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Malwah, district of Mundessor, situated on the east side of the Chunbul, 20 miles S.W. from Kotah. Lat. 24\u00b0. 55'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 37'. E.\n\n**Shadowrah.** \u2014 A town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Malwah, district of Chandrec, 40 miles N. by W. from Seronge.

Lat. 27\u00b0. 39'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 55'. E.\n\nThis was once a large town, but it is now more than two-thirds in ruins, which appear in the form of small hills and broken swells crumbling to dust. The fields in the neighbourhood are tolerably well cultivated, the principal crops being barley, wheat, tobacco, and some peas of a small kind. (Tennant, &c.)\n\n**Shahjehanpoor.** \u2014 A town in the\nMaharatta territories, in the province of Malwah, 40 miles N. N. E. from Oojain. Lat. 23\u00b0.28'. N. Long. 76\u00b0.18'. E.\n\nThis is a considerable town, and the head of a pergunnah, situated on the banks of the Sagormutty River. About half a mile to the westward is a conical hill, conspicuous at a considerable distance. (Hunter, &c. &c.)\n\nShahjehanpoor.\u2014A town in the province of Delhi, district of Bareily, situated on the east side of the Doolah, or Gurrah River, 95 miles N. E. from Lucknow. Lat. 27\u00b0.51'. N. Long. 79\u00b0.58'. E.\n\nIn the schools here each boy is provided with a black board like a slate, upon which he writes the letters with a chalk pencil. While he writes the characters, he at the same time acquires their names, and the power of each when joined in syllables; and thus reading and writing are attained by one operation. (Tennant, &c.)\n\nShairghur.\u2014A town in the province of Delhi, district of Bareily, 26 miles N. from the town of Bareily. Lat. 28\u00b0.40'. N. Long. 79\u00b0.21'. E.\n\nShamly, (Syamalaya).\u2014A town in the province of Delhi, district of Saharanpoor, 60 miles N. by E. by the city of Delhi. Lat. 29\u00b0.33'. N. Long. 77\u00b0.10'. E.\n\nThis is a place about two miles in circumference, and contains many handsome houses, with a large bazar, and the remains of a mint, where money was formerly coined. The streets intersect each other at right angles, and have separate gates at their entrances, which are shut at night for the security of the inhabitants. (G. Thomas, &c.)\n\nShanavaz.\u2014A town in the Afghan territories, in the province of Mooltau, 78 miles E. from the city of Mooltau. Lat. 30\u00b0.41'. N. Long. 72\u00b0.39'. E.\n\nShandorah.\u2014A town in the province of Delhi, district of Saharanpoor, 120 miles N. from the city of Delhi. Lat. 30\u00b0.26'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. E.\n\nShahnoor, (Sivanur).\u2014A town and district in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Bejapoor, 50 miles S. S. E. from Darwar. Lat. 15\u00b0.1'. N. Long. 75\u00b0.22'. E.\n\nThe city of Shahnoor is neither extensive nor well built, having few buildings of any elegance, except the palaces, and these are in ruins. It is enclosed by a wall and ditch; but is, notwithstanding, a place of no strength. On the outside of the city wall, to the northward, are several long streets of houses, for the most part uninhabited; and to the southward is a lake of water. From the Toombuddra to Shahnoor the land is fertile, but indifferently cultivated; the whole territory is comprehended in the fork of the Krishna and Toombuddra rivers.\n\nThis place was conquered from the Hindoos by the Bhamenee sovereigns so early as A.D. 1397; but at a later period became the capital of a small Patan state, giving the title of nabob to its hereditary possessor. Abdul Hakeem Khan, the seventh lineal descendant who reigned in 1792, was tributary to Tippoo until 1784, when he abjured his allegiance, and accepted the protection of the Maharattas. After this event, Tippoo's army, during a predatory incursion, destroyed the palaces and public buildings, blew up and razed the strong fortress of Bancapoor, and devastated the whole country, of which he retained possession until 1792, when it was wrested from him, and restored to the nabob, under the superintendance of the Maharattas.\n\nThis district is now under the Peshwa's government, being part of the territory received in exchange from the British government for an equivalent in Bundelcund. About the time when Goklak, one of the Peshwa's Jaghiredars obtained possession of Shahnoor, there was a very general disturbance and usurpation (called by the natives Kaut-\nkaec) throughout the country, and every man helped himself to whatever places he had troops enough to take.\n\nThe family of the Shahnoor Nabob had an allowance out of the revenues from the Peshwa; but it was so extremely ill paid, that in 1804 they were reduced to a state of the utmost wretchedness, were nearly naked or covered with rags, and compelled to subsist on the plants they plucked up in the fields. A remonstrance was in consequence presented by Mr. Strachey, the British agent, for arranging the possessions of the Southern Jaghredars, to the court of Purnah, which would probably have the effect of insuring greater punctuality in the future discharge of their miserable pittance. (Moor, MSS. Ferishta, &c.)\n\nShapoor.\u2014A town in the Seik territories, in the province of Lahore, situated on the S.E. side of the Ravey River, 60 miles N.E. from the city of Lahore.

E.\n\nThis is a large, well-built town, surrounded by a strong wall of stone, and a ditch. The adjacent country belongs to the rajah, who is only nominally a tributary to the Rana of Odeypoor, having been for many years sufficiently strong to maintain himself in a state of independence. (Broughton, &c.)\n\nShawabud, (Shahabad).\u2014A district in the province of Bahar, situated principally between the 25th and 26th degrees of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by the Ganges; on the south by Rotas and Bahar; to the east it has the district of Bahar; and to the west Chunar and Rhotas. In 1784 the original sircar of Shahabad contained only 1869 square miles; but it has been greatly augmented by junctions from the adjacent territories.\n\nThis district is extremely fertile, and very populous, particularly in the northern quarter near to the Ganges and Soane. In 1801, in consequence of instructions from the Marquis Wellesley, then governor-general, the board of revenue in Bengal circulated various queries on statistical subjects, to the collectors of the different districts under the Presidency. The result of their replies tended to establish the fact, that the Shahabad district contained two millions of inhabitants, in the proportion of one Mahommedan to 20 Hindoos; and that the zemindars profits generally was much above 10 per cent. on the amount of the revenue they were liable for to government. The principal towns are, Buxar, Boujepoor, and Arrah; and the chief rivers, the Ganges, Soane, and Caramnassa.\n\nShawpoor, (Shahpura).\u2014A town possessed by independent zemindars, in the province of Gundwana, district of Singrowla, of which it is the capital. Lat. 23\u00b0. 34'. N. Long. 83\u00b0. 23'. E.\n\nThis place is situated in a fine plain, amidst lofty ranges of hills, and consists of a large, straggling town, with a little fort built of rubble stone and mud. The Rhair, a considerable river, runs by the south side of the town, with a stream about 100 yards broad and four feet deep, which dashes with great rapidity over a bed of rocks, which prevent its being navigable for large boats. The plain surrounding Shawpoor is tolerably fertile.

E.\n\nThis place has never been visited by Europeans; but the natives describe it as a large town with seven gates, and at present governed by Mahommed Reza Khan, who was formerly a merchant. The Hindoos, who, for commercial purposes, visit Baloochistan, and other uncivilized Mahommedan provinces to the west of the Indus, leave their wives and female relations here for security. Shekarpoor and the surrounding district are tributary to the Cabul go-government and Amcers of Sinde.\n\nShekoabad, (Shaehoabad, the Abode of Magnificence).\u2014A town in the province of Agra, district of Etaweh, 35 miles E. S. E. from the city of Agra. Lat. 27\u00b0. 6'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 32'.

E.\n\nTo the south of this place the country is level and tolerably well cultivated; but to the north-west it is extremely rugged and covered with jungle. Six miles to the west is a plain surrounded by low hills covered with jungle. The town is nearly a collection of ruins.\n\nSher.\u2014A town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Malwah, 90 miles N. E. from Ooqjain. Lat. 23\u00b0. 58'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 55'. E.\n\nShereregur.\u2014A town in the Seik territories, in the province of Mooltan, 70 miles S. S. W. from Lahore. Lat. 30\u00b0. 55'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 24'. E.\n\nSheribon, (or Cheribon).\u2014A town in the Island of Java, the capital of a district of the same name, and situated about 150 miles E. from Batavia. Lat. 6\u00b0. 43'. S. Long. 108\u00b0. 35'. E.\n\nThe surrounding country, like the rest of Java, is remarkably fertile, and produces the finest coffee raised on the island, which is particularly noted for the smallness of the grain. Its other productions are timber, cotton, yarn, areca, indigo, sugar, and some pepper. The horses of this district are reckoned the best in Java, and in the contiguous woods and mountains the rhinoceros is sometimes discovered.\n\nThe roadsted at Cheribon is open, and only sheltered to the west by a large sand bank, with four and a half and five fathoms water, two leagues from the shore, at which distance ships of burthen are obliged to anchor. Smaller vessels run along the bank to within three-fourths of a league from the land. In order to enter the river, country craft, draw-\ning from four to six feet, are obliged to wait for the high tides, on account of the small bank at the mouth.\n\nThe appearance of Cheribon resembles a large village more than a town. It is at present the capital of a principality, divided between two princes of the same family, each of whom takes the title of sultan, and resides in it; but the exterior of their palace exhibits little of Asiatic pomp and grandeur, being built of plank and bamboos. On the right bank of the river is a small brick fort surrounded by a ditch, over which is a bridge protected by a redoubt. This fortress is of little strength, its embrasure parapet being only 18 inches thick, with only four small guns, kept more for the purpose of making signals than for defence. The mole and battery are in a state of the greatest decay, and the garrison only 15 Maduran soldiers, commanded by a European sergeant and two corporals; the whole scarcely sufficient to resist the attacks of the roving Malay pirates, who infest the adjacent seas. The European inhabitants of the town are the resident, secretary, book-keeper, surgeon-major, and three subalterns; the rest are natives, who compose two-thirds of the population, and Chinese, employed in the retail trade and agriculture.\n\nThis small state put itself under the protection of the Dutch East India Company, in 1680, since when justice and injustice have been administered by the princes of the country, in conjunction with the resident on the part of the Company. These chiefs are under an obligation to deliver to the Dutch East India Company exclusively, the produce of their respective territories at fixed prices. (Tombo, Slavorinus, &c.)\n\nShevagunga, (Sivaganga).\u2014A polygar town and district in the Southern Carnatic, 23 miles E. by N. from Madura. Lat. 9\u00b0. 54'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 30'. E.\n\nThe territory of Shevagunga was formerly termed the Little Marawar, the Rajah of Rannad being the great Marawar. It was ruled by females until about 50 years ago, when two brothers, named Murdoo, of low caste, usurped the government under the title of Dewans; and, subsequently on the death of the Ramny, having mounted the throne, assumed the ancient title of the Pandian rajas. They were expelled by the Nabob of Arcot, with the assistance of the British troops, but he afterwards reinstated them. Continuing refractory they were attacked by a British detachment, and defended themselves in the fortress of Callarcoil for five months. It was, at length, taken by storm, when the Murdoos escaped into the jungles, which, for seven miles, surrounded the fortress, but they were soon after taken and hanged. Of the old Shevagunga family there existed no female heir; the country was, therefore, given to a relation of the late Ramnys, and the tribute continued at the former sum of 50,000 pagodas.

E.\n\nThis is a large town, situated on the N. E. bank of the River Jummary. It contains a fort or walled town, on the outside of which is a good bazar, where there are many well-built houses. Opium, of a tolerably good quality, is cultivated to some extent in the vicinity; and the town is a considerable market for striped muslins, doputtals, &c. (Hunter, &c.)\n\nShumsabad.\u2014A small town in the Seik territories, in the province of Lahore, situated on the east side of the Jhylum River, 100 miles N. W. by W. from the city of Lahore.

E. coast.\n\nThe great river of Siak has its source in the mountains of the Me-naneabow country, and empties itself nearly opposite to Malacca. From the place where it joins the sea, in the Straits of Kamper or Ben-calis, to the town of Siak, is about 65 geographical miles, and from thence to a place named Pakan Bharu, about 100 more. The width of the river is generally from three-fourths to half a mile; up at the town the tides rise about 11 feet. The shores are flat to a considerable distance up the country, and the whole of the soil is probably alluvial, but about 125 miles up the river there is the appearance of high land.\n\nThe trade is carried on by vessels from the Coast of Coromandel, who supply cargoes of piece goods, and also raw silk, opium, and other articles, which they provide at Prince of Wales' Island or Malacca; in return for these they receive gold, wax, sago, salted fish and fish roes, elephants' teeth, gambir, camphire, rattans, and other canes. According to the information of the natives, the river is navigable for sloops eight days sail up the river, with the assistance of the tide. From Siak the Dutch East India Company imported annually, for the use of Batavia, several rafts of spars and masts, and large supplies of frame timber may also be procured.\n\nThe maritime power of the kingdom of Siak has always been considerable, and Malacca, Johore, and other towns, have, in former times, been attacked by fleets from Siak ports. (Marsden, &c.)\n\nSIAM, (Syama, Black).\n\nA kingdom of India beyond the Ganges, situated principally between the 10th and 15th degrees of north latitude. To the north its boundaries are unknown, on the south it has the sea and the Malay Peninsula; on the east are the countries now comprehended in the Cochin Chinese empire; and the west the dominions of the Birmans. Before its extent was so much contracted by the victories of the latter nation, its length was estimated at 360 miles, by 300 the average breadth; but these must have been the extreme dimensions, and liable to annual fluctuation. The proper seat of the Th'ay, or Siamese race, is along the banks of the great River Menam; but their sovereignty and language have, in prosperous periods, had a much wider range.\n\nThe Siam country may be described as a vast plain intersected by the Menam, on the banks of which all the principal towns are situated, and separated from the Birman and Cochin Chinese empires by two long ridges of mountains. In addition to this it possesses a great extent of sea coast along the Gulf of Siam, which\nis, however, but thinly inhabited, the Siamese having an aversion to settle on the margin of the sea, probably through dread of the Malay pirates. Like the provinces of Bengal, it is subject to annual inundations, which begin in July, and when at their height overflow the country, except the artificial sites of the villages and the trees. The stalks of rice rise with the flood, and keep on the surface until it subsides. Near the shores of the Menam, the only part of the country to which Europeans have recently had access, the land is flat, and the soil alluvial, on which account, after the rainy season is over, many extensive morasses remain, and render the climate extremely pestilential to European constitutions, causing fluxes, dysenteries, and acute fevers. In the more elevated tracts remote from the river, the country is parched and dried up.\n\nTo the overflowing of the river the land in its vicinity owes its fertility, and is very productive of rice and other plants that require a redundant supply of moisture. Wheat is also raised on the higher grounds, but in very small quantities; the Europeans formerly settled here having been obliged to import what they required for their own use. Besides these the soil is capable of raising all the richest of the productions for which Bengal is celebrated, but little comparatively is cultivated, owing to the miserable government by which the peasantry are oppressed and harassed. Here are many medicinal plants and gums, also oil of jessamine, benzoin, lack, crystal, emery, antimony, cotton, wood, oit, wax, lac, varnish, wild cinnamon, cassia buds, and iron wood, the last of which is much used by the natives, Malays, and Chinese, as anchors for their vessels. Betel nut is produced and exported in considerable quantities by the Portuguese ships and Chinese junks. Most of the fruits of Hindostan thrive in Siam, and there are in addition the durian and mangosteen.\n\nThe domesticated quadrupeds are horses, cows, buffaloes, sheep, goats, and elephants; and, in the jungles, tigers, rhinoceroses, deer, and hares, are found. There is great abundance of common poultry; besides which there are peacocks, pigeons, partridges, snipes, parrots, and other birds. The cows give but little milk, which is mostly supplied by the female buffaloes, but the natives have not the art of converting it into butter. The horses are of a very inferior race, the best being imported from Batavia. The insects and vermin are the same as in other parts of India, and the sea and rivers yield excellent fish, upon which a great proportion of the lower classes subsist. In addition to these there are fine lobsters, turtle of a good quality, oysters, and the mango fish, so much esteemed in Calcutta. The mountains in the interior yield diamonds, but little inferior to those of Hindostan, sapphires, rubies, and agates. Among the mountains and rivulets gold is also collected, and probably in considerable quantities, as much is used in Siam for the gilding of idols, temples, and other public edifices, and there is none known to be imported by sea. In the interior iron, tin, lead, and copper, are procured\u2014the latter of a good quality, but scarce.\n\nThe Siamese have never been in the habit of carrying on foreign commerce in their own vessels, the tonnage being principally supplied by the Portuguese, Chinese, and Cochin Chinese, comparatively little intercourse subsisting with Hindostan. The Menam, by which ships enter, discharges itself into the Gulf of Siam; but has a bar at its mouth, to cross which the assistance of a pilot is required. The southerly monsoon is the best season for ships to visit Siam, and the northerly for returning to Hindostan through the Straits of Malacca. Bancok, or Bancasay, situated on the river near the bay, is the principal place of trade, and the king is the chief merchant. No pri-\nvate merchant here dare to trade in tin, tutenagae, elephants' teeth, lead, or sapan wood, without permission from his majesty, who monopolises these articles, and receives them from his subjects in lieu of revenue. The excellent sauce, named ballachong, is best procured here, where it is composed of dried shrimps, pepper, salt, and sea weed, beaten together to the consistence of a tough paste, and then packed in jars for sale. Vessels bound for Siam, by taking out a fresh port clearance at Malacca, escape a number of charges. Unlike the Malays, although so near to them, the Siamese have the utmost aversion to quit their own homes, and have consequently made no maritime excursions, and planted no colonies.\n\nThe constitution of the Siam government is despotic, and there are no hereditary nobility. All the inhabitants are liable to be called on for military services, and very few standing troops are maintained. Their arms are matchlocks, always in a bad condition, spears, and creeses. They make their own gunpowder, but it is of so very inferior quality, that considerable quantities are imported. Their fortifications are stockades of trees and posts encircled by a ditch, but the real defence of Siam consists in the natural obstacles presented to invaders by the jungles, morasses, and numerous branches of rivers; to which may be added the unhealthiness of the climate, which soon thins the ranks of an army. As in the Malay states, the heir apparent to the throne possesses a legitimate authority almost equal to that of the reigning monarch. A small part of the taxes are levied in money, but much the greater part of the revenue is received in kind, and realized by sale to foreign traders. In 1750 the population was computed, by the French missionaries, at 1,900,000, but apparently without any proper foundation for the estimate.\n\nThe Siamese nation, properly so called, consists of two races, the Thay, and the Thay Jhay. Of these the latter are the most ancient, and were formerly famous for their learning and the power of their empire, of which many monuments are said still to exist. The Thay Jhay inhabit the country between the Meuam and the Mekan, or River of Cambodia; but the Thay, for the most part, inhabit on the west of the Meuam or Siam River, or between that and the frontiers of the Tinmaw (Tennasserim), Mon (Pegu), and Barma (Burman) nations. By the Burmans they are denominated Syan, from whence the Portuguese seem to have borrowed their Siam and Siaom, and from whom the other European nations have adopted the term. The former capital of Siam was named Yudia, or Yoodra; from which circumstance the Siamese are frequently, by the Burmans, called Yoodras.\n\nIn their manners and customs they greatly resemble the Burmans and Peguans. The females here are obliged to drudge in all the laborious employments, by them the woods are cleared, the earth cultivated, and the harvest reaped. Both males and females take as much pains to blacken their teeth as the Europeans do to preserve them white. The men eradicate their beards, but allow their nails to lengthen like the Chinese. They are extremely gross feeders, in which they resemble the other nations east of the Ganges. Among their edibles are rats, lizards, grasshoppers, and other insects, disgusting to the natives of Hindostan. Their houses are raised on posts, and are ascended to by a ladder on the outside. Like all the semi-barbarous nations in this quarter of the globe, their artists in gold are remarkably expert, and their filigree work singularly beautiful. They excel also in beating out gold leaf, of which a great deal is expended in adorning their temples and idols. The Chinese practitioners, who are their chief physicians, have long been ac-\ncustomed to the use of the bath in fevers and other distempers, and if they are not successful in the cure, they receive no pay. The Siamese generally are so addicted to singing on all occasions, that the missionaries found the best way of imprinting their precepts on the memories of this people, was to form them into short Latin songs adapted to popular tunes. They have a variety of musical instruments, but all disagreeable to a European ear; of the European instruments they prefer the organ, on account of the loudness of its melody, and were much attracted by it to the Roman Catholic churches. Time is still measured by vessels having a small hole perforated and placed in a tub of water, the construction of clocks being beyond their mechanical powers.\n\nThe Thay language is that which is used by the Siamese, who in their own tongue assume this name as their national appellation. It appears to be in a great measure original, and is purely monosyllabic, and more powerfully accented than any of the other Indo-Chinese languages. The Siamese contains a great variety of compositions; their poems and songs are very numerous, as are their Cheritras, or historical and mythological fables. Many of the Siamese princes have been celebrated for their poetic powers, and several of their historical and moral compositions are still preserved. The Siamese Cheritras, or romantic fictions, are very numerous; and the personages introduced, with the exception of Rama, and the heroes of the Ramayuna, have seldom much similarity to those of the Brahmins. On the eastern coast of the Peninsula, the Siamese language extends as far south as Patani, where it meets the Malay dialect.\n\nBesides the natives there are many colonies of foreigners established in Siam, particularly Chinese, Portuguese, Malays, Macassars, and Bug-gesses. At an early period the English, Dutch, and French, had also settlements, but none of them continued permanent. The commerce of the country is, at present, almost entirely conducted by the Chinese and native Portuguese; the latter of whom have now scarcely anything of the European but the name.\n\nThe national religion of Siam is that of Buddha, or Sammonacodom, and entirely resembles that of the Birmans described under the article Ava, but all sects are tolerated. The doctrines of the Siamese faith are singularly severe, and admit of no indulgencies whatever; but the bulk of the nation are persuaded, that rigid virtue and perfection are not prescribed to them, but only to their priests; and trust to their mortifications and austeritys as expiations for the faults of the whole. As among the Hindoos suicide is regarded favourably, but is by no means so generally practised. The first French missionaries reached Siam in A.D. 1662, after a most painful and arduous journey over land to the Bay of Bengal, where they embarked; but prior to this the Christian religion had made some progress so early as 1621, through the medium of the Portuguese. The French mission was subsequently prosecuted with great zeal for more than a century, and was occasionally assisted by political emergencies, but no essential progress was ever made towards effecting the benevolent intentions of the missionaries.\n\nThe Siamese histories of the Thay dynasty are said to detail, with much minuteness and great exaggeration, the events that have occurred in Siam, and the adjacent states and countries, during the last 1000 years, and also the events of 400 years prior to that period, from the building of the city Maha Nakkon, but with less precision. The records of the other dynasty, the Thay Jhay, are supposed still to exist. Notwithstanding these documents, the Siamese nation was wholly unknown in Europe, until the discovery of the route to India by the Cape of Good\nHope. The first traces of their authentic history begin about A.D. 1550, and were acquired through the medium of the Portuguese, who frequently acted as auxiliaries to the factions contending for the government. From the records of the East India Company it appears that, in 1684, they sustained considerable losses by a Mr. Constantine Faulcon (a Cephalonian Greek) one of their inferior servants, who ran away in their debt, and obtained possession of their property, by making presents to the King of Siam, whose prime minister he afterwards became.\n\nIn 1684 ambassadors were sent from Siam to Louis XIV. on board of an English vessel; and, in consequence, Messrs. Ceberet and La Loubere were dispatched as ambassadors to Siam, where they arrived the 27th Sept. 1787, and immediately solicited the king to embrace the Roman Catholic religion. In this request they were the more urgent from learning, that an envoy had arrived from the court of Persia to convert him to the Mahommedan faith. The Siamese monarch declined the conversion proposed, but entered into a strict alliance with the French, whom he allowed to garrison Bancock and Mergui, the two most important havens in his dominions. This intimacy was, however, of short duration; as, in 1688, by a sudden revolution, the king was dethroned and murdered, Faulcon executed, and the French expelled.\n\nFrom this period Siam experienced much internal discord, and many sanguinary massacres; but remained exempt from external annoyance until 1754, when, in consequence of the conquest of Pegu, the Birman dominions came in contact with those of Siam. War immediately ensued, and has continued, with the exception of a few short intervals, ever since; and, greatly to the detriment of the Siamese, who were repeatedly defeated with vast slaughter, had their capital sacked in 1766, and lost all their maritime possessions on the Bay of Bengal, and along the west coast of the Malay peninsula. But although, by the chance of war, the Siamese have been subjected to many vicissitudes, and brought frequently to the brink of destruction, they have never ceased to exist as a distinct and independent nation, for which they are probably indebted to the domestic dissensions of the Birmans, and the natural strength of their country. (Turpin, Elmore, Leyden, Symes, &c.)\n\nSiam.\u2014A city in the kingdom of Siam, of which it is the capital. Lat. 14\u00b0. 5'. N. Long. 100\u00b0. 25'. E.\n\nThis place is situated on an island formed by the Menam, or Siam River, intersected by several canals, and has several other islands adjacent. Although of great extent, it is now very thinly populated. The palace of the king is a large irregular confused building, covering a great space of ground, and surrounded by high walls, which include also several temples. In this town there are many casts of statues and cannon, the latter of a prodigious calibre, which indicate a greater perfection in the arts at some former era, than is now found among the Siamese. In 1766 this place was captured by the Birmans after a long blockade.\n\nBy the Birmans the town of Siam is frequently named Dwarawuddy, but by the natives it is called See-yatha. Most places of consequence are here distinguished by two appellations, one in the vulgar tongue, and the other in the Pali or learned language. (Elmore, Turpin, Symes, &c. &c.)\n\nSIAMPA, (Champa).\u2014A province in the Cochin Chinese empire, situated principally between the 10th and 11th degrees of north latitude. To the north its boundaries are undefined; on the south it has the sea of China; on the east Cochin China and the sea; and on the west Cambodia.\n\nThis is a small mountainous territory, separated into three divisions,\nThe eastern is a desert country, composed of mountains, some of which advance to the sea, and but thinly inhabited; the centre division is better cultivated and peopled; western Siampa is a wild, jungly country, occupied by small erratic tribes. Viewed from the sea, Siampa is more elevated than Cambodia, and presents to the eye, from on board ship, the appearance of a fine and well cultivated country; but, on close inspection, this pleasing and luxuriant appearance vanishes, leaving in its room immense tracts of pale and yellowish sand; the smooth surfaces of which are interrupted by ledges of dark rocks, which rise to a considerable height. The sea-water near them is uncommonly bright and clear.\n\nWe have very little information respecting the interior of this province; and what we have is but of dubious authenticity, having been collected by the missionaries settled in Tunquin and Cochin China, who, it does not appear, ever personally visited the country; but derived their intelligence from Chinese traders, and from the natives.\n\nAccording to their description, the inhabitants of Siampa remain in a very wild state, without towns or even large villages, having some small hamlets scattered over a great extent of space, near to which they pasture their numerous flocks of buffaloes. These are the more stationary tribes; but a great proportion of the population still continue in the migratory stage of civilization, without cultivation or manufactures, subsisting on their flocks and the spontaneous produce of the earth. (De Bissacher, Stowton, &c. &c.)\n\nSiao Isle.\u2014An island about 35 miles in circumference, situated off the north-eastern extremity of the Island of Celebes. Lat. 2\u00b0. 48'. N.

Lat. 25\u00b0. 12'. N. Long. 87\u00b0. 40'. E.\n\nThis pass, during the Hindoo and Mahommedan government, was the commanding entrance from Bahar into the kingdom of Bengal, and was fortified with a strong wall, which does not appear, however, to have been of any real service, as in 1742, a Maharatta army of cavalry passed into Bengal to the S.W. of this pass, through the hills above Colgong.\n\nSikar.\u2014A town in the Rajpoot's territories, in the province of Ajmeer, 53 miles N. N. W. from Jyengur. Lat. 27\u00b0. 32'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 5'. E.\n\nSilhet, (Srihatu, a rich Market).\u2014A district in the province of Bengal, situated principally between the 24th and 25th degrees of north latitude. To the north and east it is bounded by a lofty ridge of mountains inhabited by many wild tribes; on the south by Tipperah and Mymunsingh; and it has Mymunsingh to the west. In 1784 it contained 2861 square miles, and the revenue was only 233,924 rupees. By Abul\nFazel, in 1582, this district is described as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Silhet, containing eight mahals, revenue 6,681,621 dams. This sircar furnishes 1100 cavalry, 190 elephants, and 42,920 infantry. Sircar Silhet is very mountainous. It furnishes many enough slaves for the seraglio.\"\n\nThis is the most easterly of the Company's possessions in Hindostan, being within 350 miles of the province of Yunnan in China. Although so near to this rich empire, no sort of intercourse subsists betwixt them; the intermediate country being a confused mass of mountains covered with jungle, and inhabited by some of the most uncivilized tribes in Asia. This region has been examined only a very short way from the frontiers of Silhet; but, from the most consistent accounts supplied by the natives, there is reason to believe the intervening space is destitute of navigable rivers, without towns or villages, and wholly trackless. These difficulties, however, are not insurmountable, and it is to be hoped the Bengal government will not leave it much longer unexplored.\n\nUnder the Mogul government Silhet was formed into a fougadarry, or military station, more on account of its remote and secluded situation beyond the Brahmapootra and Soornah, than from any reasonable apprehensions of foreign invasion, protected as it is by inaccessible hills, or impenetrable jungles. Its actual dimensions since the dismemberment of several pergunnahs, are computed at 2861 miles, divided into 146 small pergunnahs, held by about the same number of zemindars. Near to the town of Silhet the country presents a novel appearance to an eye long habituated to the flat surface of the lower districts of Bengal. It is composed of a number of irregularly insulated hills, placed at a short distance from each other, and covered with trees and verdure to their summits; while to the north and east lofty mountains rise abruptly like a wall, to the height of several thousand feet, and appear as if they had, at some remote period, withstood the surge of the ocean.\n\nDuring the rains the greater proportion of the land is laid under water, by the overflowing of the Soornah and other rivers, by which it is intersected, and the passage from Dacca is performed for nearly the whole way over rice and pasture fields, which, in the cold season, are perfectly dry. Over this tract, when the floods are at their height, there is above 10 feet of water; the elevated sites of the villages appear like islands; the masts of the vessels are entangled with the branches of trees, while their progress is impeded by the thickness and adhesion of the paddy stalks. When the inundation drains off, the land is left in an excellent condition for rice cultivation; food of all sorts is consequently remarkably cheap\u2014the average price of rice per rupee being four or five maunds (of 80 pounds each), and coarser grains still cheaper. In addition to this supply every stream and puddle swarms with fish, which are caught, with scarcely any trouble, with a small hand net, or even a piece of a mat. As may be supposed, wages are extremely low, being from half a rupee to one rupee and a quarter per month; but the labourers being naturally averse to exertion, and never working but when stimulated by hunger, the country is on the whole very indifferently cultivated.\n\nThe necessaries of life being so very cheap, there is little occasion for gold and silver coins\u2014a more minute subdivision of value being required; the whole rents are consequently paid in cowries, which are the medium also of commercial transactions. Formerly large boats were built here for the royal fleet stationed at Dacca, and square-rigged vessels have also been occasionally constructed. The chief export\nfrom Silhet is chunam or lime, which is found in inexhaustible quantities; and from hence Calcutta, and the most remote stations in Bengal, are furnished with that article. Another principal export is cargoes of oranges\u2014a considerable tract of country consisting almost entirely of orange plantations, the fruit of which sells on the spot at 1000 for a rupee. The other productions are aguru or fragrant aloe wood, and a manufacture of wild silk, named muggadooties. Great numbers of elephants are also caught in this district, but their quality are inferior to those caught near the sea coast. Silhet and Azmerigunge are the chief towns, and the Soormah and Megna the principal rivers. In 1801, when an investigation respecting the population of Bengal took place, this district was found to contain 492,495 inhabitants, in the proportion of two Mahomedans to three Hindoos.

The colours are bright and beautiful, but do not appear durable; the texture is close and strong. It is said to wear much longer than any China or Hindostany fabric; but the price is proportionally high.\n\nSillah-mew is a handsome town, shaded by wide-spreading trees, and embellished with several temples. The soil is in general poor; but some of the fields are regularly fenced, and there are numerous herds of cattle in the neighbourhood.

E.\n\nThe fortifications of this place are not strong. The River Tunga in the rains washes the eastern wall, in which face there is no ditch. Each angle of the fort has a cavalier tower, and there are three small towers in each face of the curtain, where a number of jinjals and swivels are mounted; but the rampart is too narrow for large guns. In this neighbourhood the manufacture of cotton cloth begins; for there is none fabricated to the westward. The wet lands here are generally of a light soil, and, at the entrance into the open country, the laterite seems to terminate. The breed of cattle in this vicinity begins to improve, when compared with that to the west. During Hyder's reign he brought carpenters to Simoga, from Mangalore, and built a number of lighters about eight tons burthen; but they proved of no sort of use.\n\nIn 1790, on the plain near to this place, a battle was fought between Purseram Bhow and Mahommed Reza, usually called the Binky Nasbob, or burning lord; being, on account of his activity, generally employed by the sultan to lay waste the country. In this action the Maharattas had scarcely anything to do\u2014the whole brunt of the engagement falling on the Bombay detachment under Captain Little, which, at the commencement of the battle, only mustered 750 men. The enemy's force never was actually ascertained, but probably approached 10,000 men.\n\nAt this time Simoga contained\n6,000 houses, the whole of which were destroyed by the Maharattas; the women were ravished, and the handsomest carried away. Such of the men as fell into the hands of the Maharattas were killed, and of those who escaped the sword a large proportion perished by hunger. These ruffians did not even spare the kudali swami, who is the gooroo (high priest) of all the Maharatta Brahmins of the Smartal sect, and by them considered as an actual incarnation of the deity. They plundered and burned his matam or college, which so enraged the pontiff that he threatened them with excommunication, and was only pacified by a present from the Peshwa of 400,000 rupees; half of which Tippoo extorted from him and paid to Lord Cornwallis, on account of the fine imposed at the treaty of Seringapatam. This unfortunate city was again completely plundered in 1798; but, having since enjoyed a respite from the ravages of war, it has recovered considerably its wealth and population. (F. Buchanan, Moor, &c. &c.)\n\nSincapoor, (Singapura).\u2014A town situated on a small island, at the southern extremity of the Malay peninsula. Lat. 1\u00b0. 24'. N. Long. 104\u00b0. E.\n\nThe straits of Sincapoor are formed by a cluster of innumerable little islands, which are covered with wood, have a great variety in their shapes, and are indented on all sides with little bays and sandy coves, where abundance of the finest turtle resort. The passage between these islands is in some parts very narrow, yet the water is clear and deep. The appearance of a fleet of ships, while winding through this romantic group of islets, has a very picturesque effect, while the small boats of the natives are plying backwards and forwards with refreshments, particularly of turtle, one of which, weighing three or four hundred pounds, may be purchased for a couple of dollars. At the eastern mouth of the straits of Sincapoor lies a rock, named by the Portuguese Pedra Branca, on account of its being covered with the white excrement of birds. Here the China Seas commence; and ships generally take a departure from this rock, or from Point Romania, when proceeding on to Canton.\n\nThe town and principality of Sincapoor were founded by adventurers, who originally migrated from the Island of Sumatra. (Johnson, Marsden, &c.)\n\nSinde.\u2014(Sindhu.)\n\nA large province of Hindostan, formerly included in that of Mooltan, and situated on both sides of the Indus, between the 23rd and 28th degrees of north latitude. The general boundaries of this province, including Tatta, are Mooltan and Afghanistan on the north; Cutch and the sea to the south; on the east it has Ajmeer, the Sandy Desert, and Cutch; and on the west the sea, and the mountains of Balochistan. In length it may be estimated at 300 miles, by 80 miles the average breadth, and it is intersected in a diagonal line throughout its whole extent by the river Indus, which affords moisture to the husbandman, and to the merchant an excellent inland navigation, only excelled by that of Bengal.\n\nOn the north Sinde adjoins the country of Behawal Khan, and the fort of Subzal. Proceeding from thence south, the country is possessed by an infinite number of petty chiefs, who are in general tributary to the Ameers of Sinde. The names of the principal districts on the eastern bank, proceeding from the north to the south, are Bhoongbarce, Durdee, Leheree, Khyrpoor, and Puhlanee. The boundaries of these districts are, the Sandy Desert and the country of Jesselmere to the east.\n\nFurther south are the fort of Deenghur, 40 miles from Khyrpoor, the districts of Koondecyamy, Nous-\nhebree P'eroze, Puneeche, and Sundaya, Norudunya Kohince, Khoojur, Junecjee, Lakat, Shadapoor, Hakakundy, Novejancee, Kakabegaree (through which flows a branch of the Indus), Nussurua, Ropa, and Nusserpoor, and the Tandee of Illahyar Khan, from which Jessechmere is distant about 160 miles to the eastward. Of these districts the Sandy Desert forms the eastern boundaries.\n\nAt the Tandee of Illahyar Khan, the branch of the Indus, named the Fulalce commences, and flows in a S.W. direction to Seidpoor, when it rejoins the main stream, after forming the insular district of Killee, named also the Doabch, the hills of Jaree and Canja, the fort of Hyderabad, with Seidpoor and some other villages. On the eastern bank of the Fulalce is situated the district of Chuckurhalee.\n\nThe branch of the Fulalce, named the Goonoe, takes its rise near the village of Seidpoor; to the eastward of it is situated the district of Chachgam, which yielded, when possessed by the Calories, a revenue of four lacks of rupees, which is now reduced to two. Also the district of Kooodara, villages of Buhna, Sayekpoor, Dholee, and the district of Pulajjar, and the islands of Wah and Alibukcer. These are bounded on the east by the Sandy Desert.\n\nThe district of Khyrpoor is situated on a branch of the Goonoe; the fort of Illyabad is 10 miles distant, and Puttyghar 40 miles distant from Khyrpoor. The fort of Parkur, situated on the borders of the Joudpoor territories, is 110 miles to the eastward of Hyderabad, Islampoor 50 miles from Khyrpoor, Alighur 40 miles from Khyrpoor, and Shahgur 80 miles from Khyrpoor. Americote, now belonging to Joudpoor; the districts of Majur Jancee and Kitee, a fort on the borders of the Sandy Desert; the districts of Doka, Behrampoor, Americpoor, and Bhoondea.\n\nOn the west bank of the Indus, Sindee is bounded to the north by the Shekarpoor district, of which a considerable portion of the southern quarter is held by the Sindee chiefs. Proceeding from thence south are the districts of Noushehra, Berkapoor, Khanna, Ladgoonoe, Kumburgunde, Meil, Nalookshahpoor, Nalumendu, Chandye, formerly included in the province of Chandookee; which province, during the government of the Calories, is said to have yielded a revenue of 16 lacks of rupees, now reduced to four. The villages of Eesan and Hoojrec, the small district of Jancee Duny, and an island formed by the Naree, a branch of the main stream, containing the districts of Nuggon Bhagban, Khodabad, Wuchoolee, Jamtanee, and Kurreempoor.\n\nThe districts situated to the westward of the Naree are Kacha, Bhobak, Jungar, Bazar; a hut, 100 miles from Corachie, besides numerous small villages, occupied by Baloochees, and other migratory tribes. The district of Tharn, from which Corachie is said to be 60 miles distant, is possessed by the Nomurdies, who have also half the district of Shal. The districts of Jurukhee, Sonda, and many smaller ones, are adjacent to Tatta. The Sita and its streams, and the Nusserpoor and Naree branches of the Indus, are said to be now dried up.\n\nA great part of this province, lying to the westward of the confines where the monsoon ceases, is a barren sterile soil, and totally unproductive, from the absence of moisture. Easterly from the meridian of 67\u00b0 40', the land near to the Indus appears capable of the highest degree of improvement; but to the northward of Tatta, and a small distance to the westward of that river, the country is mountainous, rocky, barren, and thinly inhabited. In the months of June and July the thermometerrangestrom 90\u00b0 to 100\u00b0, but the air in the northern parts of Sindee is so pure, and so much refreshed by the cooling breezes.\nfrom the westward, that the heat is not excessive. About Hyderabad the climate is healthy, and the air, in the month of August, remarkably clear, the difference of refraction in astronomical observations being then scarcely perceptible.\n\nThe Indus, from the city of Tatta to a branch called the Foliciy, has from two to two and a half fathoms of water; off Tatta it has three, four, and more frequently five fathoms, with a muddy bottom. The banks in the province about Hyderabad are in general well cultivated, except where the Ameers have made enclosures to confine game; but these are so numerous and extensive as to occupy many of the most valuable spots of land. In the month of August it has generally two and three fathoms of water, but during the fair season it is dried up. The Goonee is much the same as the Folickly, with respect to inhabitants and cultivation, but has less water on an average, being only from one and a half to two fathoms. It is also much narrower, contracting in many places to 30 yards, and can only be termed navigable in the month of August.\n\nThe cultivation of Sinde depends on the periodical rains, and the process of irrigation by means of canals and water-courses. During the swelling of the river grain and other seeds are raised; the remainder of the year is employed in the production of indigo, sugar-canes, huldee, &c. &c. Every beegah of land, watered by a canal or wheel, pays a revenue of from one and a quarter to three and a half rupees to the government; one wheel is capable of watering 16 beegahs. A duty of one rupee is also levied on each khunwar (120 pounds) of grain reaped by the farmer.\n\nGarden land producing fruit trees pays two and a half rupees per beegah to government, and the spring crop of tobacco yields a revenue of four and a half rupees per beegah. The land revenue on raw sugar is collected in kind, and is rated at four and a half rupees per beegah. These exactions do not end here; for on all the productions of the earth duties are subsequently collected at the markets, and articles paying duty in one district are not thereby exempted from fresh extortions if transported to another. It generally happens that the sum total of the duties and customs levied by the officers of government greatly exceeds the original prime cost of the articles. When boats arrive at Tatta a tax is exacted proportionate to the sum expended on their construction.\n\nThe principal articles of home produce exported from Sinde are rice, ghee, hides, shark fins, pot-ash, saltpetre, assafetida, b'dellium, madda, frankincense, Tatta cloths, horses, indigo, oleaginous, and other seeds. Allum, musk, and horses, are imported from Mooltan and the countries to the northward for re-exportation. The other imports into Sinde are tin, iron, lead, steel, ivory, European manufactures, sandal and other scented woods, from the south of India; swords and carpets from Khorasan and Candahar; silk and other articles from the Persian Gulf. The Mooltany merchants settled in Sinde are the principal traders, and the wealthiest part of the community.\n\nThe exports from Sinde to Bombay are shark fins and flesh, b'dellium, ghee, pot-ash, saltpetre, hides, oil of sesame, wheat, assafetida, mulej, sirshif oil, raisins, almonds, colouring plants, pistachio flowers and nuts, shawls, cloths, mustard, wild saffron, black cummin seed from Kerman, white cummin seed, chintzes both from Sinde and Khorasan. The imports to Sinde from Bombay are white sugar, sugar-candy, steel, iron, tin, tutenague, lead, cochineal, betel nut, black pepper, dried cocoa nuts, vermillion, red lead, quicksilver, Bengal and China silks and cloths, cinnamon, cardamons, cloves, nutmeg, sandal wood, ginger, chinaware, pearls, aloes, and amutas.\n\nTo Muscat are exported dressed leather, rice, wheat, sirshif oil, ghee,\nThe imports from Muscat to Sinde are dates, limes, roses, Ghilam silk, elephants' teeth, pearls, almonds, preserved fruit, cowries, slaves, arsene, senna from Mecca, quince seeds, and gum. The imports to Sinde from Cutch are cotton, snuff, unwrought iron found in Cutch, and the small Arabian aloe. The intercourse between this province and the countries to the northward is chiefly carried on by means of the Indus, which is navigable for small vessels to a great distance from the sea. There are no established land caravans from Sinde to Mooltan and Kabul, but an intercourse is carried on by merchants and travellers. The East India Company had formerly a factory, and carried on a considerable trade in the province of Sinde; but it was withdrawn, probably owing to the disorderly state and poverty of the country. An unsuccessful attempt was recently made by the Company from Bombay to renew the commercial intercourse.\n\nCommerce and agriculture of all descriptions have rapidly declined since the accession of the present rapacious rulers of Sinde. The duties levied on foreign and domestic trade are estimated at two-thirds of the capital of the merchant and mechanic; and the cultivator is compelled to sell his grain at a low price to government, by which it is monopolized, and subsequently resold at an exorbitant profit. In addition to this extensive tracts of the best land on the banks of the Indus are set apart and converted to desolate wastes and jungles for the preservation of game, the Amcers being unfortunately most passionately addicted to hunting. The British embassy, in 1809, saw scarcely any thing deserving the name of cultivation from Corachie to Helliah, on the road to Hyderabad, a distance of nearly 150 miles.\n\nThe internal government of Sinde is a military despotism, the supreme authority being vested in three brothers of the Talpoony family, whose names are Meer Gholam Ali, Meer Kurreem Ali, and Meer Murad Ali. The eldest brother, Meer Gholam Ali, has the title of hakim, or ruler of Sinde, and is considered as the head of the government. There are two brothers of the reigning family, Meer Sohrab and Meer Thara, who, although not ostensibly partakers of the supreme authority, possess large tracts of territory, and exercise every function of sovereignty within their respective limits.\n\nThese Ameers belong to the Mahommedan sect of Shecas, but they are remarkably tolerant, both to the Soones and to the followers of the Brahminical doctrines. The Mahommedan inhabitants compose the military strength of the country; and, during the intervals of peace, are employed as husbandmen, artificers, and menial servants\u2014the internal commerce of the country being almost exclusively carried on by the Hindoo part of the population. Although Sinde is now but scantily peopled, it appears, at some former period, to have been much more thickly settled and inhabited; and the extraordinary number of tombs and burial grounds scattered over the country, where no population is at present seen, is quite remarkable. From Tatta to near Hyderabad the country is almost destitute of human beings, there being only one village on the whole route.\n\nThe armies of Sinde are collected from the various tribes who hold lands by a military tenure from the Ameers, at whose summons they are obliged to bring their quotas into the field. These tribes are reckoned 42 in number; many of whom have retained their distinctive appellations since the first Mahommedan invasion, and consisted principally of adventurers, who descended from the lofty mountains of Baloochistan into the plains of Sinde, with the exception of the Jokia and Jhut tribes, which are both of Sindean origin.\n\nThe Ameers of Sinde, collectively,\ncan bring into the field an army of 36,000 men, composed of irregular cavalry, armed with matchlocks, swords, and shields, and intended to act as infantry whenever circumstances require it. It is not unusual for the whole army of Sinde to dismount and fight on foot. The Baloochees are reckoned good marksmen, but not susceptible of discipline. The pay of a common soldier in the field is five pice per day, including his provisions; during peace he receives an allowance of about one and a half pounds of rice per diem. The Sindean cavalry are but indifferently mounted; and, although stouter, are not such good swordsmen as the natives of Hindostan. The infantry resemble the Persian and Arabs, and, like most Hindostany soldiers, are overloaded with arms; besides a sword, shield, and dagger, the cavalry carry matchlocks.\n\nThe revenues of Sinde, during the Calorie government, were estimated at 80 lacks of rupees per annum, but are now reduced, in consequence of the rapacity and ignorance of the present rulers, to 42 lacks; from which should be deducted the Kabul tribute of 12 lacks, which is liable to be enforced should that state recover from the effects of its internal discord.\n\nAfter the death of Meer Futteh Ali his surviving three brothers divided the territorial possessions and revenues; the eldest, Meer Gholau Ali, receiving one half as the ostensible head of the government, and being bound to defray the permanent, civil, and military expenses of the state. These charges, however, are inconsiderable, as, during a cessation of external hostilities, very few soldiers are retained; as in many other of the eastern principalities the hoarding of treasure is a favourite maxim of state policy, the amount of specie deposited in the different forts throughout the country is consequently supposed to be very great, a small proportion of what is received being ever permitted again to circulate.\n\nThe districts subject to the authority of Meer Sohrab are situated in the north-east quarter of Sinde, and yield a revenue of about five and a half lacks of rupees per annum. His government is described as milder, and more favourable to agriculture and commerce, than that of the principal Ameers. His troops are computed at four or 5000 men.\n\nThe authority of Meer Thara extends over the districts on the eastern banks of the Indus; his revenue does not exceed three lacks of rupees, but his country is improving, and his troops amount to 6000 men. He was some years ago defeated and taken prisoner by Meer Gholau Ali; but, at the solicitation of the other Ameers, released, and his territories restored.\n\nThe customs and revenues of Sinde are farmed to private persons; and the Ameers, with the view of creating competition generally, remove the farmers annually, and they, having consequently no interest in the improvement of the country, direct their attention to the realizing the greatest possible profit within the period of their contract. In effecting this object they are guilty of many extortions, of which the Ameers subsequently avail themselves, as a pretext for confiscating whatever property they may have accumulated.\n\nAmong the local customs, in some degree peculiar to Sinde, the following may be mentioned: If a person finding a thief in his house use force to drive him away, and in the contest either is killed, no inquiry is made. It often happens that villages are attacked by thieves; if in the conflict any are killed, no inquiries are made; but if they are taken prisoners, and then put to death, the parties are subjected to trial. Thieves taken in a contest of this kind are brought before a magistrate, who examines the transaction, and compels them to restore the property, or im-\nposes a heavy fine, which, if they are unable to pay, they suffer death. One fourth of all property recovered belongs to the government. If either a denizen or a foreigner die, leaving a son or brother, his property devolves to them. If he leaves a wife with child, and the child prove a son, he succeeds to the property, otherwise it is seized for the state. A daughter only receives a certain allowance from her father's property; and a widow is merely entitled to her jewels, &c. or to a pecuniary compensation of 100 rupees.\n\nThe men of Sinde are generally of a middle size, well made, and more robust than the more southern natives of India. Their complexions are very tawny, with dark eyes and eye-brows, and uncommonly good teeth; like the Seiks, they allow their hair to grow. The Mahomedans are all Soonees, and most of them of the sect of Haneefee; but they have few religious prejudices, nor do their females suffer any strict seclusion. The dancing girls in Sinde are, in figure, manners, and appearance, superior to those commonly seen in Hindostan.\n\nThe Sinde province generally swarms with mendicants in a state of the utmost misery; but here also, as in other Mahomedan countries, are seen a class of sturdy beggars pretending to be Seids, or descendants of the prophet, who demand charity in the most insolent and arrogant manner. They frequently go about soliciting alms in parties of seven or eight on horseback, well dressed, armed, and mounted, and having a green flag carried before them. When their demands are not gratified they bestow abusive language with the most liberal profusion.\n\nThe province of Sinde was the first conquest in Hindostan effected by the Mahomedans, which long preceded their invasions by the route of Attock and Lahore. The Khalif Ali sent a general, who effected some trifling conquests on the borders of Sinde. Moavych sent twice his general Amir or Hamir; but, after long and bloody conflicts, he was forced to desist. Under the Khalif Walid the conquest was at last effected by Mahommed Casim, in the year of the Hijera 99; but, on account of the distance and the natural strength of the country, it did not long remain attached to the Khaliphat. Subsequently to this there appears to have existed two contemporaneous authorities in Sinde; the one a Rajpoot family, and the other a Mahomedan; the latter probably converted from the Hindoo faith, both of which assumed the title of Jam. The Lomra, a Rajpoot race, are said to have retained possession for the long period of 500 years; after which it was successively occupied by different chiefs; one of whom, Mirza Eceau, of the Turkannee tribe, having called in the Portuguese to his assistance against the soubahdar of Mooltan, they plundered the city of Tatta, which was then the seat of government.\n\nSinde remained with the Turkannees until the reign of Acber, who dispatched an army by the way of Sewistan, which succeeded in effecting its conquest; and from that era it became tributary to the Delhi emperors, who conducted the administration through the medium of soubahdars resident at Mooltan and Tatta. About A.D. 1737, during the alarm excited by the threatened invasion of Hindostan, Mahommed Abassee Caloree, of Sewce, availed himself of the apprehensions of the soubahdar of Sinde, and influenced him to resign the government into his hands for three lacks of rupees, which he promised him, but never paid. In 1739 Nadir Shah defeated the Caloree chiefs, and obliged them to take refuge in the fortress of Amereote on the borders of the desert, but he afterwards permitted them to retain the government as tributaries.\n\nMahommed Abassee Caloree died in 1771, and was succeeded by seve-\nral princes of the same family until 1783, when they were expelled by the Talpooree tribe, and the present reigning family established on the throne. The surviving representative of the Calorees had recourse to Timour Shah of Cabul, who, under pretence of reinstating him, commenced a war against the Talpooree Amoors; but afterwards desisted for an annual tribute of 12 lacks of rupees, which was regularly paid until the death of that sovereign in 1792. On this event it was reduced to seven lacks of rupees, and subsequently during the internal dissensions of his successors withheld altogether. The Amoors of Sinde, being thus relieved from all fears on the side of Cabul, began to encroach on their neighbours, wrested Corachie from the chief of Baloochistan, and extended their frontiers on the side of Shekarpoor and Ajmeer.\n\nThe neighbouring chiefs with whom the Amoors maintain a political intercourse are, the Rajah of Jondpoor; the Nabob of Behawulpoor; Mahmood Khan, the chief of Baloochistan; the Jemmadar of Cutch; and Meer Khan Lais, the chief of the petty state of Soomeeany, in Mekran. The territories of the last-mentioned chief, who is tributary to Baloochistan and inimical to Sinde, occupy the sea-coast to the north west of Corachie. In 1809 an envoy from Jeswnt Row Holkar arrived at Kitee, the residence of Meer Thara, for the purpose of proposing a union between his master, the sovereign of Persia, and the French, against the British; but the proposal was not favourably received.\n\nThe natural resources of Sinde are considerable, and would, under an improved system of government, render its chiefs extremely powerful and dangerous to their neighbours to the north and west; but this province, although properly belonging to Hindostan, is so detached from it by the great Sandy Desert which bounds it to the east, that it takes no part in its politics. No change, however, for the better is to be expected while the country continues under the sway of its present ignorant and rapacious rulers.

With the leaders of the Seiks of these provinces, the extent of their possessions, or the climate and productions of the country under their rule, we are little acquainted. Those in Mooltan, as well as those settled along the banks of the Jhyium, are said to be constantly engaged in predatory warfare, either with the officers of the Afghan government, or other Mahommadan chiefs, who have jaghires in this neighbourhood.

E.\n\nSingrowla.\u2014A district in the province of Gundwana, situated about the 24th degree of north latitude, and bounded on the east by the district of Palamow in Bahar.\n\nThe Singrowla Rajah's territory begins on the N.W. at a narrow defile on the Bickery Hills, called Bulgant. In this district, between the hills, are extensive valleys, but wild and uncultivated, and frequently covered with forests. A few small villages are scattered over the face of the country, in the vicinity of which some cultivation is seen\u2014but the land generally is very desolate. Iron is found in abundance, the price being from one and a half to two and a half rupees per 80 pounds, according to the quality. In this miserable region several Hindoo mythological excavations and images have been discovered; but of very inferior execution, when compared with those of the Deccan or south of India. Singhrowla is still possessed by various petty independent native chiefs, the principal of whom is the Rajah of Shawpoor. (Blunt, &c.)\n\nSingumner.\u2014A district belonging to the Maharatta Peshwa, in the province of Aurungabad, situated about the 20th degree of north latitude, and estimated to yield a revenue of 10 lacks of rupees per annum. It is a hilly, but fertile district. The chief towns are Singumner, Battowal, and Bejapoor.\n\nSingumner.\u2014A town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Aurungabad, district of Singumner, of which it is the capital. Lat. 19\u00b0. 46'. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 40'. E.\n\nSinkel.\u2014A town situated near\nthe mouth of the Sinkel River, on the west coast of Sumatra. Lat. 2\u00b0. 15'. N. Long. 98\u00b0. 2'. E.\n\nThe principal articles of export from hence are camphor, benzoin, wax, and gold. The benzoin catty here weighs 56 ounces avoirdupois, and the camphor catty 56 ounces troy weight. The imports are iron in flat bars, opium, swivel guns, muskets, gunpowder, stick lac, long cloth, white and blue, salamores ditto, small looking glasses with gilt frames, kinkobs, carpenters' tools, red and yellow taflatties, gurrias, and Bandana handkerchiefs.\n\nVessels trading here should be constantly on their guard, and prepared to repel an attack. The head merchants only should be suffered to come on board, and all armed persons carefully excluded. (Elmore, &c. &c.)\n\nSintalsheeroo.\u2014A town in the Northern Carnatic, 50 miles W. N. W. from Ongole. Lat. 15\u00b0. 44'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 18'. E.\n\nSion.\u2014A small town and fort in the Island of Bombay, about nine miles from the Presidency, at the opposite extremity of the island.\n\nFort Sion is placed on the top of a small conical hill, where it commands the passage from Bombay to the neighbouring Island of Salsette, and was of importance while the Maharratas possessed that island. At the foot of the little hill of Sion is the causeway, or vellard, built by Mr. Duncan, across a small arm of the sea which separated the two islands. It is well constructed of stone, and has a drawbridge in the centre. It is too narrow for carriages to pass in bad weather, but it is of great advantage to the gardeners and farmers who carry the daily supplies of provisions to Bombay. This causeway was begun in 1797, and finished in 1805, at an expense of 50,575 rupees. (M. Graham, &c.)\n\nSirgoojah.\u2014A district in the province of Gundwana, situated about the 23rd degree of north latitude, and at the eastern extremity adjoining the district of Palamow in Bahar, notwithstanding which proximity but little is known respecting it. Sirgoojah is intersected by the Hatsoo, which is the principal river, and possessed by many petty native chiefs, over whom the Nagpoor Rajah claims a superiority, and from whom he occasionally exacts a tribute.\n\nSirgoojah.\u2014A town in the province of Gundwana, district of Sirgoojah, of which it is the capital, and situated about 12 miles from the southern frontier of Palamow. Lat. 23\u00b0. 5'. N. Long. 85\u00b0. 50'. E.\n\nSirhind, (Serhind).\u2014A large district in the province of Delhi, of which it occupies the north-western quarter, and situated between the 30th and 31st degrees of north latitude. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Sirhind, containing 33 mahals, measurement 7,729,466 bengahs; revenue 160,790,594 dams. Seyurghal 11,697,330 dams. This sircar furnishes 9225 cavalry, and 55,700 infantry.\"\n\nThe portion of this district which borders on Hansy Hissar and Carnaul is extremely barren, being covered with low wood, and in many places almost destitute of water. About A.D. 1357, Feroze III. cut several canals from the Jumna and the Sutuleje, in order to fertilize this naturally arid country; and afterwards built a fort at Sirhind, but both the fort and canals have long been in ruins. The city of Sirhind was formerly the capital of this territory, but it is now a scene of desolation, and has probably never recovered the dreadful ravages of the Seik Bairaggee Banda about 1707, who is stated not only to have destroyed the mosques, but to have levelled its palaces and public buildings to the ground. Patiala is now the largest and most flourishing town in this province, and next to it is Tahnesir (Thanesur), which is still held in high religious veneration by the Hindoos, as is also the River Sereswati, which flows through the country.\nAt present the greatest part of this district is possessed by the Malawa Singh class of Seiks. In March, 1809, Rajah Ranjeet Singh, the Seik chief of Lahore, gave up the forts he had occupied on the left bank of the Sutuleje to the British government, which restored them to their former owners. (Sir J. Malcolm, 11th Register, &c.)\n\nSIRHIND.\u2014A town in the province of Delhi, the capital of a district of the same name, and 155 miles N. N. W. from Delhi city. Lat. 30\u00b0. 40'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 55'. E.\n\nThis place was very flourishing in the time of Abul Fazel, who describes it as a famous city, containing the delightful gardens of Hafez Rehneh, but it now exhibits only a shapeless mass of extensive ruins. In the neighbourhood are numerous mango groves, and also some excellent tanks of water. Between this place and Delhi are extensive plains containing the towns of Panniput and Carnaul, and renowned as the scene of great battles, both in ancient and modern times. Whether Delhi, Agra, or Kanoge, were the capital, this was the route from Persia and Tartary, by which the conquerors of Hindostan advanced. Sirhind, at present, belongs to a Seik chief, named Bingh Singh. (11th Register, Rennel, &c.)\n\nSIRINAGUR, (Srinagar).\u2014A town in the province of Allahabad, district of Bundelcund, 12 miles N. N. E. from Chatterpoor. Lat. 25\u00b0. 6'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 55'. E.\n\nSIRSEY, (Siras).\u2014A small town in the province of Balhar, district of Balhar, 25 miles E. S. E. from Patna. Lat. 25\u00b0. 22'. N. Long. 85\u00b0. 35'. E.\n\nSITIVACCA, (or Sitivaque).\u2014A small town in the Island of Ceylon, and noted for being the chief theatre of intercourse, both friendly and hostile, between the Candians and their European neighbours. Lat. 7\u00b0. 2'. N. Long. 86\u00b0. 13'. E.\n\nSitivacca is the last station belonging to the British in this quarter, and is separated from the King of Candy's country only by a large branch of the Malivaddy River, which winds around here, and is joined by a branch of the Malivaggonga, a little way further down. On the summit of a hill stood a large range of buildings defended by an entrenchment, formerly occupied by the Dutch, but now in ruins. Towards the interior are high hills, covered with thick forests and jungle. (Percival, &c.)\n\nSIVANA SAMUDRA.\u2014An island formed by the River Cavery, in the province of North Coimbetoor, about nine miles in length, by one in breadth, and remarkable for an uncommonly grand cataract.\n\nThere is here the ruins of a bridge across the Cavery, communicating with the island, which is formed of large columns of black granite, each about two feet in diameter, and 20 feet in length. This magnificent work was formerly 300 yards in length, but is now nearly destroyed. Directly opposite was the southern gate of a wall that surrounded the city, to which there was a flight of steps. The interior is now a jungle of long grass, with many banyan trees of great size, and the principal street may still be traced, extending from north to south about one mile in length. There are also the ruins of many Hindoo temples, great and small, and much sculpture of various sorts. In one apartment there is a statue of Vishnu, seven feet long, in the best style of Indian carving. The figure is thick, with a pyramidal cap, the eyes closed, and seven cobra capella snakes forming a canopy over his head. The apartments are small and dark, and must be examined with torches, the principal statue being in the remotest chamber.\n\nThe nearest station to the cataract is distant about a mile from the northern gateway. The fall is about 150 feet; but unless in the rainy season the body of water is not sufficient to make it impressive, and the descent is interrupted by numerous\nprojecting rocks; during the height of the rains it must be an imposing spectacle. The surrounding scenery is wild, and the vicinity exhibits marks of impetuosity of the torrent. The island is in general rocky, and the land, although fit for dry grains, is but little cultivated. Three miles from the upper end of the island, at Birra Chuiki, is another waterfall. (Salt, F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nSoaghun.\u2014A town in the Mahratta territories, in the province of Malwah, 60 miles west from Oojain. Lat. 23\u00b0. 12'. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 50'. E.\n\nSoane River, (Sona, Golden).\u2014The rivers Soane and Nerbudha have their sources in the table land of Omecuntuc, in the province of Gundwana. Lat. 22\u00b0. 53'. N. Long. 82\u00b0. 15'. E. The Soane rises on the east side, and flows through Pindarah, where, being joined by numerous other streams from the N. E. side of this mountainous territory, it proceeds in a northerly direction through Sohagepoor and Bogalecund, whence turning to the eastward pursues its course to the Ganges, which it joins in the province of Bahar, after having performed a winding course of about 500 miles. Near its origin this river is said to be designated by the natives the Sonabudda, to distinguish it from the Nerbudha, by which, conjointly with the Ganges, the southern part of Hindostan is insulated. (Blunt, Remel, &c.)\n\nSoank, (Sankia, Shelly).\u2014This small river has its source in the province of Bahar, district of Clunta Nagpoor, from whence it flows in a southerly direction, and is afterwards joined by the small River Boikee, when their united streams receive the name of the Braminy Nudly River.\n\nSoderah.\u2014A town in the Seik territories, in the province of Lahore, situated on the east side of the Chinaub, 48 miles N. N. W. from the city of Lahore. Lat. 32\u00b0. 27'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 30'. E.\n\nSohagepoor.\u2014A small district in the province of Gundwana, situated principally between the 23d and 24th degrees of north latitude.\n\nIn ancient times this territory composed part of the Hindoo state of Gurrah, but during the reign of Aurengzebe it was formally annexed to the soubah of Allahabad, although but nominally subjected to the Mogul empire. It is a barren, mountainous, unproductive country, and possessed by a variety of savage native chiefs, from whom the Rajah of Nagpoor occasionally extorts a tribute.\n\nSohagepoor.\u2014A town in the province of Gundwana, district of Sohagepoor, of which it is the capital, situated 80 miles S. by E. from Rewah. Lat. 23\u00b0. 29'. N. Long. 81\u00b0. 45'. E.\n\nSohal.\u2014A town in the province of Allahabad, district of Bundelcund, 35 miles S. E. from Callinger. Lat. 24\u00b0. 40'. N. Long. 80\u00b0. 52'. E.\n\nSohnpoor.\u2014A town possessed by independent native chiefs, in the province of Gundwana, situated on the south side of the Mahanuddy River, 127 miles S. E. from Ruttnupoor. Lat. 20\u00b0. 47'. N. Long. 83\u00b0. 45'. E.\n\nSolor Isle.\u2014An island in the Eastern Seas, separated from the Island of Floris, or Ende, by the Straits of Floris. In length it may be estimated at 30 miles, by 15 the average breadth.\n\nSomalpet.\u2014A town in the Nizam's territories, in the province of Nandere, 52 miles N. N. E. from the town of Nandere. Lat. 19\u00b0. 49'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. E.\n\nSomnee.\u2014A town in the province of Gujrat, district of Werrear, situated to the S. E. of Rahdunpoor.\n\nThis is a large place surrounded by a wall, which is, in many parts, falling to pieces. In the interior, although the houses consist generally of an upper floor, they make a very wretched appearance. Somnee stands in a swamp, is surrounded by numerous puddles, and in the rainy season is almost under water.\nTo the N. W. is a plain, destitute of wood, but partly cultivated, and abounding with antelopes.\n\nThis town belongs to the Nabob of Rahdunpoor, named Ghazi ud Deen Khan, who, in 1809, was 70 years of age. He usually keeps his court at this place, his eldest son residing at Rahdunpoor. (Macmurd, &c.)\n\nSompre.\u2014A town in the province of Cashmere, situated on the east side of the Jhylum River. Lat. 34\u00b0 17'. N. Long. 73\u00b0 25'. E.\n\nSonehut.\u2014A small town and mud fort in the province of Gundwana. Lat. 23\u00b0 33'. N. Long. 82\u00b0 33'. E. This is the capital of the Corair Rajah, whose territory in the maps is called the country of the Rajah Chohans.\n\nSonghur, (Sonaghar).\u2014A village in the Gujrat Peninsula, situated in a wild country about 25 miles N. W. from Wankancer.\n\nOn a hill adjacent to this place is an ancient Hindoo temple, dedicated to the sun, on the cornices and sides of which are representations of battles carved on marble slabs, in a style much superior to modern Hindoo sculpture. The hill on which it stands appears to have been formerly fortified, and the remains of houses executed in the same style are still visible.\n\nThe entrance of this temple leads up a flight of steps to a veranda six feet wide, which encompasses the whole building, and contains also marble slabs and images. Over these steps is a lofty portico, which apparently has been designed for an orchestra. Over the body of the pagoda are two beautiful domes, and a third covers the sacred spot, or place of worship. In this sanctum there is a male figure about three feet high, with uplifted hands, each holding an image of the sun. The forehead is elevated, and the hair fancifully dressed; and, on different sides, are two smaller idols of the same kind.\n\nA contiguous building encloses a figure of Bhavani standing on an animal resembling a tortoise, and encircled by female attendants, the whole having the appearance of considerable antiquity; but there is no inscription to lead to a knowledge of the date or history of this edifice, which is, however, mentioned in the Hindoo records of the Gujrat Peninsula, so remote as the time of Ray Laka, who reigned above 900 years back. The pallias, or funeral monuments, in the vicinity, are much defaced, some of them are legible so far back as 165 years ago. The situation of this pagoda is retired and romantic, and it is distinguished in the country by the name of Soorjee Dewul, or the temple of the sun. (Macmurd, &c.)\n\nSooolo Isles, (Sulu).\u2014A chain of islands, above 60 in number, extending from the north-eastern extremity of Bornco to the western extremity of Magindanao, and comprehended between the fourth and seventh degrees of north latitude. The Island of Sooloo, from which the Archipelago is named, is situated about latitude 6\u00b0 N. Long. 121\u00b0 E. and may be estimated at 40 miles in length, by seven the average breadth. Viewed from the sea it presents a fine prospect, superior to the generality of Malay countries. The hills not being very high do not stop the clouds; it has not, therefore, any regular rainy season like the larger islands, but most rain falls during the S. W. monsoon. Much rain also falls at the change of the monsoons, especially the autumnal; but there are no storms during these changes, and very seldom at any other time. There are several good harbours among these islands, particularly at Bewabewa, Tavitave, Tappool, Seccasee, between Boobooan and Tappeantana, south of Basselan. The harbour before Bewan, the Soooloo capital, is not good, except during the S. W. monsoon.\n\nThe Island of Sooloo being small and populous, considerable attention is paid to agriculture. The inha-\nbitants plant rice, but the crop is not to be depended upon, on account of the uncertainty of rain; for which reason they also cultivate many roots, such as the Spanish and sweet potatoe, the St. Helena yam, and the China yam, both red and white. The rice consumed is mostly imported from Magindanao. There are a great variety of fine tropical fruits, such as oranges, jacks, durians, custard apples, mangoes, mangosteens, rambosteen, and many others. The Sooloo having much intercourse with China, and many Chinese settled among them, they have learned the art of engrafting and improving their fruits.\n\nThe breed of horses is tolerably good, and Captain Forrest asserts, wild elephants are found in the interior, which appears extraordinary, considering that the island is both small and populous. Spotted deer, goats, and black cattle, are plenty; but the natives seldom milk the cows. They have few sheep, and what they have are imported; but wild hogs abound, and do much mischief. From the nature of its situation, beyond the violence of the monsoons, this island enjoys a perpetual summer; but the interior is cool, especially under the shade of the teak trees, which are here numerous.\n\nIn remote times, on account of its situation between Magindanao and Borneo, Sooloo was the great mart of all the Mahommedan states in this quarter of the Eastern Sea. The Portuguese do not appear ever to have colonized or conquered these islands, but they visited them frequently. While the trade with Japan was open, two or three ships came from thence annually, bringing silver, amber, silks, chests, cabinets, and other curiosities made of fragrant woods, besides great quantities of silks and porcelain from China. Sooloo was then also visited by vessels from Java, Sumatra, Ceylon, and the Coast of Coremandel, with valuable cargoes.\n\nAt present, two Chinese junks usually arrive annually from Amoy, loaded with brass salvers, iron in small pieces, sugarcandy, raw silk, black nankin, white, strong linen, kangans, iron pans, china ware, flowered silks, tea, cutlery, hardware, brass wire, gongs, beads, and fireworks. In return they export principally to China, biche de mar, black and white, wax, pearl oyster shells, bird-nests, and tortoise-shell. Besides these, they take a sea-weed named agal agal, used as a gum or glue, caroangoil, clove bark, blackwood, rattans, sago, various barks for dying, cassia, pepper, native camphor, sandal wood, curious shells for grottos, pearls, and spices.\n\nThe pearl fishery is both a source of wealth to the inhabitants of Sooloo, and a nursery for mariners to equip their prows when wanted. Their drudges for the pearl oyster are generally made of bamboo very light, and are sunk with a stone. The nobles claim the large pearls, which are afterwards purchased by the Chinese. The Sooloos get most of their sago, and many other articles, which they dispose of to the Chinese, from the Tedong people on the north-east coast of Borneo, such as biche de mar, couries, tortoiseshell, &c. and in order wholly to engross the profit, they endeavour to prevent the Tedong people from trading with any nation but their own. With Magindanao a considerable trade is carried on, from whence the Sooloos receive rice cleaned and in the husk, for which they usually pay with Chinese goods. At this island are also seen many Boadjoo fishermen, who speak a language different from that of the Sooloos. The Buggesses also trade with these islands, and chiefly bring cotton manufactures from Celebes. The Sultan of Sooloo, like other Malay chiefs, is the principal merchant in his dominions.\n\nThe sovereignty of Sooloo Isle is hereditary, and the government a mixture of the feudal and aristo-\nSOOLOO ISLES.\n\nThe power of the sultan being much controlled, and frequently counterpoised by that of the nobles. The chief offices are also hereditary. The Bajah Laut (lord of the sea) is high admiral. The datuos, or nobles, are described as exercising a most oppressive authority over the people. There are many towns on the sea coast; in the interior they are chiefly straggling huts, but there are no horaforas, or aborigines. There is a law both at Magindanao and Sooloo, that no Chinese can be made a slave; but slaves of all other classes are extremely numerous. The Sooloos seldom go in their own vessels to foreign parts, except on predatory excursions to make slaves among the Philippines. They are not much accustomed to the use of fire-arms, but depend on the lance, sword, and dagger, at the use of which they are very dextrous; and, being of a martial disposition, at an early period they had subdued not only all the adjacent small isles, but a great part of the coast of Borneo. They have the character of being sanguinary and treacherous, on which account their alliance has frequently proved much more dangerous than their open hostility.\n\nThe Sooloos have reached a more advanced stage of civilization than the Magindanese have yet attained. They are fond of music, and have Philippine slaves who play on the violin. In 1773 Captain Forrest saw the sultan dance a minuet with his niece, and the datuos, or nobles go down a country dance; but the latter he thought performed very ill, on account of their heavy slippers. The men generally go dressed in white waistcoats buttoned down to the waist, and white breeches. The ladies wear a fine white waistcoat fitted close, and a petticoat over drawers which reach to the knee. They are not kept strictly confined here as in most Mahommedan countries, but allowed to go abroad as in Europe.\n\nIn their families are many Philippine and some Spanish slaves, whom they purchase from the Illanos and Magindanese cruisers, and frequently use extremely cruelly, having complete power of life and death. Among this people murder for the most frivolous dispute is scarcely held a crime. The only virtue they boast of is courage, and to this their claim appears more than doubted; honesty, industry, or hospitality, are qualities entirely foreign to their nature.\n\nThe Sooloo language is a very mixed dialect, but is derived mostly from the Malay, the Javanese, and the Tagala. They have adopted the Malay character, and have a few books in that language, with which they are chiefly supplied by the Bugresses. There are some who have a smattering of Arabic; but a great proportion of even the highest in rank cannot write. They pretend to have records regarding the discovery of the magnet and the art of manufacturing gunpowder; but they are probably indebted for both to the Chinese: they are, however, very good practical navigators. The Sooloos are of the Soonee Mahommedan sect; but their zeal for that faith, or attention to its ordinances, are feeble and capricious. Their places of worship are mean, and destitute of all decoration, internal or external. They very rarely perform the pilgrimage to Mecca; but they retain an inveterate hatred to the Spaniards, and to their religion. Although the Mahommedan persuasion be that of the government, the most numerous portion of its subjects are aborigines, known by the designations of horaforas, or idaan, the nature of whose religion is still unknown. In 1773 the calipha, or high priest of Sooloo, was a Turk, who had travelled much in Europe.\n\nThe Sooloos have a tradition, that their island once formed part of an ancient Bornean empire, founded by the Chinese; but the Magindanese assert, that the Sooloos were for-\nmerly subject to them. From the time the Spanish colonies were planted in the Philippines, to the present day, an unceasing warfare has subsisted with the Sooloos, in which the latter have had generally the advantage, although they occasionally sustained reverses. Prior to 1746 the Spaniards attacked them with a powerful fleet of 30 ships, and obtained possession of Bewan, the capital of Sooloo, where the remains of Spanish buildings are still to be seen; but the Spaniards were ultimately compelled to withdraw their troops. In 1775 the Sooloos attacked a settlement formed by the East India Company on the Island of Balambangan at a great expense, and drove the settlers on board their vessels. In that year the reigning sultan's name was Israel, the son of Sultan Ameer ul Momenceen. This monarch had received his education at Manilla, where he and his father were long held in captivity, until released at the capture of that city by the British in 1762. The sultans of Sooloo have more than once sent an ambassador to Pekin. In 1800 the Sooloos treacherously assassinated the captain of a country ship and his boat's crew; after which they attempted to carry the ship by boarding, but were repulsed. In the course of the same year they were repeatedly visited by other trading vessels; such accidents, among the Malay states, not being considered as in the slightest degree disturbing the harmony of commercial relations. (Forrest, Dalrymple, Leyden, Asiatic Registers, &c.)\n\nSoonda, (or Sudha).\u2014A small district in the south of India, situated above the Western Ghauts, but comprehended in the British division of North Canara. The town of Soonda, or rather its ruins, are in Lat. 14\u00b0.34'. N. Long. 74\u00b0.58'. E.\n\nIn the western part of this district the garden cultivation is the chief object of the farmers, and they raise promiseuously betel nut, black pepper, betel leaf, cardamoms, and plantains. The garden peppers of Soonda and Bednore are equal in value, and are better than what grows spontaneously in the proportion of ten to nine. Towards the east side of Soonda the great object of agriculture is rice. The rains in this quarter are not so heavy as further west; but they are sufficient to ripen a crop of rice that requires six months for that purpose. Sugarcanes in small quantities are also raised on the rice grounds. The cattle of Soonda are of a larger breed than those of Cooncan or Haiga; but they are greatly inferior to the breed found further to the eastward. Throughout the forests tigers and wild buffaloes are very numerous, but there are no elephants.\n\nDuring the sway of its native rajas the country is said to have been cultivated, and the town of Soonda large, comprehending, according to native accounts, three miles within the walls each way, and fully occupied by houses. The country having been repeatedly the seat of war between Hyder and the Maharattas, has been greatly devastated, and the houses in the town reduced to less than 100. When Hyder acquired possession of it, it was said to contain 10,000. The outermost wall of Soonda was estimated by the natives to have been 48 miles in circumference; and there were formerly three lines of fortifications round the town. Within the two spaces surrounded by the outer lines, the houses were scattered in small clumps, with gardens between them; but the whole country is now very thinly inhabited.\n\nAll the arable land in Soonda is considered the property of government; but the value of an estate is fixed, and so long as a tenant pays his rent, it is not customary to turn him or his heirs out of their possessions. All the villages extending along the Maharatta frontier belong to government; but they are in a very desolate condition. Imody Sadasiva Rajah, the last prince of\nSoonda, was expelled by Hyder in 1763, when he took refuge at Goa, where he surrendered to the Portuguese the whole of his territory below the Ghauts for a stipulated pension. In 1799 the Soonda district was transferred to the East India Company, and with them it remains. (F. Buchanan, Wilks, 5th Report, &c. &c.)\n\nSoondia.\u2014A town in the province of Sinde, situated on the banks of the Indus, on the route from Tatta to Hyderabad. Lat. 24\u00b0 58'. N.\n\nThe banks of the river are here low and swampy, and the depth of water is about four fathoms. One mile N.N.E. from Soonda, the Cooper Hills approach the western bank of the Indus, which winds with a serpentine course, and washes their bases for about two miles in extent. (Maxfield, &c.)\n\nSoongur.\u2014A town in the province of Gujrat, 39 miles E. by S. from Surat. Lat. 21\u00b0 8'. N. Long. 73\u00b0 38'.

Long. 90\u00b0 43'. E.\n\nThis was once a large city, the provincial capital of the eastern division of Bengal, before Dacca was in existence, but it is now dwindled to a village. The name appears to have been anciently that of a region. Abul Fazel describes it as famous for the manufacture of a beautiful cloth, called cassah (cosseas), and the fabrics it still produces justify its ancient renown.\n\nA.D. 1279, the Emperor Balin, when in pursuit of Toghril, the rebel governor of Bengal, arrived at this place, where he was complimented by Dhing Raj, the chief of the surrounding country. Pakherud Deen, the first independent monarch of Bengal, fixed his residence at Soonergoong, A.D. 1340. (Renel, Stewart, Abul Fazel, &c.)\n\nSoonel.\u2014A town in the Maharratta territories, in the province of Malwah, 60 miles S. by E. from Kootah. Lat. 24\u00b0 21'. N. Long. 76\u00b0 5'. E.\n\nThis is a place of considerable extent, and of a square form, having two broad streets that cross each other at right angles in the middle of the town. (Hunter, &c.)\n\nSoonput, (Sunaput).\u2014A small town in the province of Delhi, 26 miles N.W. from the city of Delhi. Lat. 29\u00b0 N. Long. 76\u00b0 53'. E.\n\nThe country adjacent to this town formerly derived great benefit from the canal dug by Ali Merdan Khan, but it is now in a barren and desolate state. North of this city is a mausoleum erected by Khizzer Khan, a Patan nobleman, descended from the family of Shere Shah. (G. Thomas, &c.)\n\nSoopoor.\u2014A town in the Rajpoot territories, in the province of Ajmeer, 65 miles N. E. from Kotah. Lat. 25\u00b0 43'. N. Long. 76\u00b0 45'. E.\n\nThis is the capital of a small principality subject to Jyenagur, and now possessed by a relation of the Jyenagur Rajah's.\n\nSooropoorn, (Surapura).\u2014A town in the Nizam's territories, in the province of Bejaipur, situated on the north side of the Krishna River, 130 miles S.W. from Hyderabad. Lat. 16\u00b0 15'. N. Long. 77\u00b0 E.\n\nSoory.\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Birbloom, 50 miles S.W. from Moorsheadabad. Lat. 23\u00b0 54'. N. Long. 87\u00b0 32'. E.\n\nSoorootoo Isle.\u2014A small island in the Eastern Seas, about 15 miles in circumference, situated off the west coast of Borneo. Lat. 1\u00b0 45'. S. Long. 108\u00b0 46'. E.\n\nThis island lies W.S.W. from Carimata, and between them there is a sufficient passage which a ship might run through, if compelled by necessity. Wood and water are to be had on the west side of Soorootoo, and also plenty of stock, such as fowls and buffaloes. (Elmore, &c.)\n\nSoosoo.\u2014A small town on the\nwest coast of Sumatra. Lat. 3\u00b0 45', N. Long. 97\u00b0 10'. E. At this place pepper is sometimes to be had in exchange for gold dust, the Aceh gold dust being reckoned the best. In Soosoo Bay there is much foul ground, with a rocky bottom.\n\nSoosmeer.\u2014A town of considerable size in the province of Malwah, 57 miles N. N. E. from Oojain. Lat. 23\u00b0 55', N. Long. 76\u00b0 10', E. In this neighbourhood the soil is of a rusty iron colour, and but little cultivated.\n\nSoosohooonan, (Susuhunang).\u2014A district in the Island of Java, the ruler of which is dignified by the Dutch, who were always remarkably liberal in bestowing titles, with the appellation of Emperor of Java; among his own subjects he is named Ratu Agong and Susuhunang. Kiripon, or Soerecarta (Suryakarta), his capital, is situated two days inland from Samarang, and in the adjacent country are forests of teak, and other valuable wood.\n\nThe era of Javanese history, of which the chronology is tolerably well ascertained, goes as far as 600 years back. The present Soosohooonan, who passes for the lineal descendant of the first monarch, is the 56th human birth who has sat on the throne. Prior to the reign of this dynasty was that of their devatas, or demigods, among whom are reckoned the patriarch Adam and his son Seth; in the same list with whom are found the Hindoo triad Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahadeva. Following these are certain persons whom we may conjecture to have been deities worshipped by the Javanese, before the introduction of either the Hindoo or Mahomedan religions.\n\nPrevious to the propagation of the Mahomedan religion, this people were brave and enterprising; and, about the year 1400, besides possessing a great portion of Java, their power was supreme in the Eastern Seas, and their conquests extended to Sumatra, Borneo, and even as far as the Moluccas. They became known to Europeans only in the decline of their power, and suffered greatly by the encroachments of the Dutch. About the middle of the 17th century, in consequence of the rebellion of Manco Boemi, a prince of the blood, the susuhunang found himself so much embarrassed, that he made a cession of his country to the Dutch East India Company, who restored half to him as their vassal, and bestowed the other half on Manco Boemi, the person who had rebelled against him, on the like condition. Prior to 1740 this sovereign was still proprietor of all the territory to the east of Cheribon; but his dominions, in consequence of a war with the Dutch, were again further entailed. The dynasty, however, still continues to exist and reign, as, in December, 1813, Soerecarta, his capital, was visited by Mr. Raffles, the British governor of Java, who met with a most gracious reception; the description of which, and of the subsequent entertainments, indicate a more considerable degree of civilization than could have been expected in the centre of Java, and a great adoption of European manners and customs. (Stavorius, Edinburgh Review, Leyden, &c. &c.)\n\nSooty.\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Ranjeshy. Lat. 24\u00b0 26', N. Long. 88\u00b0 2', E.\n\nIn 1757, when Scraje nd Dowlah apprehended an attack from the English, and believing that their ships of war could proceed up the eastern branch of the Ganges to the northern point of the Cossimbazar Island, and from thence down the Bhagirathi to Moorshedabad, he commanded immense piles to be driven into the river at Sooty, by which it has been rendered not navigable for any construction larger than boats, and even for these during only a part of the year. Here an action was fought in 1763, between the British troops and those of Meer Cossim, in which the latter\nwas defeated. (Stewart, Seid Ghohum Hossein, &c.)\n\nSoping, (Sofin).\u2014A principality in Celebes, anciently one of the most powerful on the island. It extends partly along the western shore of the bays of Boni and Tolo; to the north it is bounded by a great lake, and on the south it borders on Lamocroc. Its chief production is rice, and, like most of the states of Celebes, it appears to be as frequently subject to female as to male sovereigns, which is remarkable in a country professing to follow the Mahommedan faith. The natives of Soping are reckoned very brave in war, and the policy of the Dutch, which is to sow dissension among the petty states, occasions their having a great deal of practice. In 1775 Soping is described as an independent state in alliance with the Dutch, but governed by its own king. (Stavorusinus, &c.)\n\nSopra River, (Sipra).\u2014This river has its source among the Vindhy mountains in the province of Malwah, from whence it flows in a northerly direction, until it joins the Gilly Sinde River. Their united streams afterwards fall into the Chumbul.\n\nSorut.\u2014A district in the Gujrat Peninsula, situated about the 22d degree of north latitude. By Abul Fazl, in 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Soret, containing 73 mahals, out of which number 13 are on account of port duties; revenue 63,437,366 dams.\"\n\nWhen the Ayeen Aeberry was compiled, Sorut appears to have comprehended a great proportion of the Gujrat Peninsula, the prior name of which was Cottiwar, or Cattivad.\n\nSourabhaya.\u2014A Dutch settlement on the north-eastern coast of Java, and the capital of a government subordinate to that of Java. Lat. 7\u00b0. 11'. S.\n\nThis place is situated on the banks of a river one and a half miles from the sea shore. It is navigable up to the town for vessels of 100 tons burthen, and one side of the bank is made convenient for tracking. The environs and the banks of the river contain many villages, inhabited by two-thirds Javanese and Malays, and the remainder Chinese. The country around Sourabhaya is very fertile, and shaded by thickets of bamboos, bananas, and other shrubs. The land is flat, and the soil so light, that it can be ploughed with a single bullock; and there is here a breed of horses, which, though small, are strong and handsome. The Dutch garrison is quartered in a brick fort, containing a small arsenal on the right bank of the river, on which side dwell the governor and most of the officers. This place is the depot for the quotas of troops which the chiefs of Madura and Samanap are obliged to furnish to the Dutch East Company.\n\nThere are here several building yards for vessels not drawing more than 10 or 12 feet water, which are afterwards sold to the petty princes on Borneo and Bally, and for transporting the rice raised in the neighbourhood. The mountains in the vicinity contain a hard stone, in colour and veins resembling box-wood, which is worked with a wheel by the natives very tastefully into candlesticks, plates, and goblets. They also manufacture many other little articles, such as combs and brushes of buffaloe's horns. A league and a half distant from Sourabhaya, upon a hill, that extends along the River Bagiran, is a saltpetre house, the urine being procured from the earth, much intermixed with the dung of bats, which are very numerous in the neighbourhood.\n\nShips from Batavia bound to China, or the Philippines, generally touch for refreshments at this place, especially during the season of the north-westers. The adjacent country is remarkably populous, and the natives are governed by two Tomogons, one of whom is allied to the Emperor of Jaya. Within a circumference of 12 miles\nthe campongs or villages of the Javanese, Malays, and Chinese, are so many, that they appear to be only the continuation of the town. (Tombe, Bligh, &c.)\n\nSourera.\u2014A town in the Northern Circars, 56 miles W.N.W. from Garjain. Lat. 19\u00b0.53'. N. Long. 84\u00b0.37'. E.\n\nSOUTH OF INDIA.\n\nThis division of Hindostan has the figure of a triangle, of which the course of the River Krishna forms the base, and the coasts of Malabar and Coromandel the sides. Its extent from the Krishna to Cape Comorin, which forms the apex of the triangle, is about 600 British miles, and its breadth in the widest part is about 550, from whence it tapers to a point at Cape Comorin. The great geographical feature of this region is a central table land, elevated from 3000 to 5000 feet above the level of the sea, separated by wild, abrupt, and mountainous declivities from the low flat countries to the east and west, which form a belt of small but unequal breadth between the hills and the sea. This central eminence is usually termed Balaghaunt (above the ghauts), and the lower belt the Payenghaunt (below the ghauts).\n\nIn this geographical division of India the mass of the population consists of Hindoos, the Mahomedans being comparatively very few; the primitive Hindoo manners and customs are consequently preserved in a state of great purity, particularly in Timnevelly and the adjacent districts. In this quarter the lapse of 20 centuries has apparently made no change in the habits and peculiarities of the Hindoo, or in his civil condition and religion. His diet is frugal and simple; his hut is composed of mud, the leaves of the coco nut tree, and a few bamboos; and a small strip of cloth is his garment. The country is subdivided into villages comprehending some thousand acres of arable and waste land, the boundaries of which, amidst political revolutions and convulsions, have scarcely ever been altered. The constitution of the villages resembles a little republic, or rather corporation, having its hereditary municipal officers and artificers.\n\nFormerly all the governments in the South of India were little more than an assemblage of polygarships, under a superior chief, who, though he had a general control over the whole, exercised very little authority in the interior management of their respective districts. Hyder was the only Indian sovereign in this quarter who ever subdued all his petty feudatories, and was really, according to European ideas, master of his country.\n\nThis fertile region has evidently undergone a gradual decay since the first intrusion of the Mahomedans, and its decline appears to have been accelerated since the commencement of the British influence, so long as it was exerted through the medium of the native chiefs, whose oppressive mode of collecting the revenue contributed more to ruin the country than all the wars and tumults that had occurred. Many provinces have continued in high culture, although exposed to constant wars, while others have become deserts in the midst of peace. The open violence of armies has probably done less injury than the fines, fees, exactions, and contributions, which have been imposed by the tyranny, or permitted by the weakness of the state. The buildings, tanks, channels, and even ridges, that separated former fields, the ruined villages, general tradition, books, accounts, sumnuds, and inscriptions, all combine to give a high idea of the former cultivation and opulence of India south of the Krishna. Except Madras there are not now any great cities in this division of Hindostan. The ancient great Hindoo princes did not, in fact, want a great revenue; they had\nno expensive establishments to keep up, and the simplicity of their manners required but little. Religious ceremonies were probably the chief expense of the state, the soldiers being supported by grants of land. The earliest Mahommedan army that crossed the Krishna was led in 1310 by Kafoor against Dhoor Summooder, the capital city of Belal Deo, the sovereign of Karnata.\n\nAlthough the Brahminical religion was probably the most general in the South of India, other systems had at certain periods an extensive sway. 1st. The Jains, who reject the authority of the Vedas and Purans, of which profession the sovereigns of Karnata appear to have been until the 12th century of the Christian era. 2dly. The Bhauddha, who had temples. 3dly. The Mahommedan religion, which was introduced through the medium of the commercial intercourse between Arabia and Malabar. 4thly. A numerous colony of Jews, settled at Cochin and in other parts of Malabar. 5thly. A knowledge of the true religion had made some progress at an early period, but the Nestorian doctrines were those professed.\n\nThe territories comprehended in this division of Hindostan are, a small portion of the Bejapoor Province; the Balaghat ceded districts; the Carnatic, northern, central, and southern; Mysore, Canara, Malabar, Barramahal, Coimbetoor, Dindigul, Salem and Kistnagerry, Cochin and Travancor; under which heads respectively further topographical details will be found. (Thackery, Wilks, Lushington, Edinburgh Review, Rennel, 5th Report, &c.)\n\n**Sravana Belgula.**\u2014A village in the territories of the Mysore Rajah, 36 miles N. by W. from Seriapuram. Lat. 12\u00b0. 45'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 43'. E.\n\nThis place is celebrated as being the principal seat of the Jain worship, once so prevalent over the South of India. Near to the village are two rocky hills, on one of which, named Indra Betta, is a temple of the kind named Busty, and a high place with a colossal statue of Gomuta Raya; the height being 70 feet and three inches. The Duke of Wellington, who visited this place, was of opinion, that the rock had been cut down until nothing but the image remained.\n\nThe Jains constitute a sect of Hindoos, differing in some important tenets from the Brahminical, but following in other respects a similar practice. The essential character of Hindu institutions is the distribution of the people into four great tribes. The Jainas admit the same division into four tribes, Brahmims, Khetris, Vaisyas, and Sudras; and perform like ceremonies from the birth of a male to his marriage. They observe similar fasts, and practice still more strictly the received maxims for refraining from injury to any sentient being. They appear to recognize as subordinate deities some, if not all the gods of the prevailing sects; but do not worship in particular the five principal gods of those sects, nor address prayers, nor perform sacrifices to the sun or fire. They differ also from the Brahminical Hindoos in assigning the highest place to certain deified saints, who, according to their creed, have successively become superior gods. Another doctrine in which they materially disagree with the orthodox Hindoos is the rejection of the Vedas, the divine authority of which they deny.\n\nIn this particular the Jainas agree with the Buddhists or Sangatas, who equally deny the divine authority of the Vedas, and who in a similar manner worship certain pre-eminent saints, admitting likewise as subordinate deities the whole pantheon of the orthodox Hindoos. These two sects (the Jains and Buddhists) differ in regard to the history of the personages whom they have deified; and it may be hence concluded that they had distinct founders, but the original notion seems to have been\nthe same. All three agree in the belief of transmigration. Jaina priests usually wear a broom, adapted to sweep insects out of the way, lest they should tread on the minutest being. In Hindostan the Jainas are usually called Syauras; but distinguish themselves into sravacas and yatis, or laity and clergy.\n\nParswa or Parswanatha, the 23d deified saint of the Jainas, and who was perhaps the founder of the sect, was born in the suburbs of Benares, and died, at the age of 100 years, on Mount Sautet at Parsonauth, among the hills between Bahar and Bengal. Some of the other sanctified places of the Jains are Papapuri, near Rajahgriha, in Bahar; Champapuri, near Boglipoor; Chandravati, distant 10 miles from Benares and the ancient city of Hastinapoor, in the Delhi Province; also Satrunjaya, said to be situated in the west of India.\n\nThe mythology of the orthodox or Brahminical Hindoos, their present chronology adapted to astronomical periods, their legendary tales, and their mystical allegories, are abundantly absurd; but the Jainas and Buddhists greatly surpass them in monstrous exaggerations of the same kind.\n\nThis village is wholly inhabited by Jainas, who differ considerably from those of Tulava (Canara). They assert that the bunts of Tulava are Vaisyas, and will not acknowledge that any Sudras belong to their sect. On the Bengal side of India the Jains are mostly of the Vaisya caste, and in the Mysore they are wholly addicted to trade and merchandize. They are now thinly scattered all over India, being nowhere numerous, except in Canara. (Colebrooke, F. Buchanan, Mackenzie, &c.)\n\nSri Permaturu.\u2014A small town in the Carnatic, 28 miles from Madras. Lat. 12\u00b0.59'. N. Long. 80\u00b0.2'. N.\n\nThis town is celebrated as the birth-place of Rama Anuja Acharya, the great Brahmin saint and re-\n\nformer, and the founder of a sect. His birth is supposed to have happened in A.D. 1016. Before the appearance of Rama Anuja, the most prevalent sects in this neighbourhood were the followers of Buddha and the Charvaca, both of which are now extinct in this part of the country.\n\nSrimuttra.\u2014A town in the province of Agra, the residence of a petty rajah, who is tributary to the Ranah of Dhoopoor. Lat. 26\u00b0.41'. N. Long. 77\u00b0.20'. E.\n\nThis is a town of considerable size, built on a naked rock of red stone, of which material all the houses are constructed; but they are of a mean appearance, and the streets very narrow. Working the red stone into slabs furnishes employment for the greater part of the inhabitants. (Broughton, &c.)\n\nSuan.\u2014A small town in the province of Bahar, district of Rotas, 25 miles S. E. from Patna. Lat. 25\u00b0.15'. N. Long. 86\u00b0.25'. E. Here an action was fought in 1761.\n\nSubbulghur.\u2014A town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Agra, situated 65 miles S. W. from the city of Agra. Lat. 26\u00b0.22'. N. Long. 75\u00b0.25'. E.\n\nThis place is surrounded by a high stone wall, in good repair, with a number of bastions; but the artillery is very insufficient for their defence. One side of the fort stands on the edge of a deep precipice. Between Subbulghur and Bejighur, to the south, the country is tolerably well cultivated, and the villages numerous. (MSS. &c.)\n\nSubbulghur.\u2014A town in the province of Delhi, situated on the east side of the River Ganges, 12 miles south from Hurdwar. Lat. 29\u00b0.48'. N. Long. 78\u00b0.10'. E.\n\nThere is here a very extensive line of fortification enclosing the town, both of which exhibit little more than naked walls falling to decay. Much of the ground within the fort is under cultivation. (Hardwicke, &c.)\nSubroy.\u2014A small town in the province of Cutch, on the road from Lucknow Bunder to Mandavie, on the Gulf of Cutch, from which place it is distant 23 miles to the northward. This place stands on a rising ground, and is defended by a small castle. It appears populous, and the surrounding country is tolerably well cultivated.\n\nSubunreeka River, (Swarnareka, with Golden Sands).\u2014This river has its source in the province of Bahar, district of Cluta Nagpoor, from whence it flows in a south-easterly direction, until, after a winding course of about 250 miles, it falls into the Bay of Bengal. Before the acquisition of Cuttack, in 1803, this river formed the boundary of the Bengal presidency, towards the territories of the Nagpoor Maharattas, in the Orissa Province.\n\nSuccadana.\u2014A town on the west coast of the Island of Borneo, and a considerable mart for the sale of opium. It is a custom here, as at all the eastern ports, to give a present at the first audience, in proportion to the rank of the person visited. The king's present here is about 50 dollars, the vajah's about 30, and the shahbunder and agent about 20 each. The rajah and his family commonly monopolize the sale of opium. In 1786 the price of tin here was 16\u00bd Spanish dollars per pecul of 133\u00bd pounds. The Chinese junk always keep up the price of opium while they remain here, which is from January to August. (Elmore, &c.)\n\nSuckut.\u2014A town and small district in the province of Lahore, intersected by the Beyah River, and possessed by petty Seik chiefs. Lat. 32\u00b0. 41'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 45'. E.\n\nSugud Bayan Bay.\u2014A bay in the Island of Magindanao, where there is a good harbour, near to which the indigo plant grows spontaneously; and in the vicinity are wild horses, cattle, and deer. The entrance into this bay is only five miles wide. (Forrest, &c.)\n\nSugouly.\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, district of Bettiah. Lat. 26\u00b0. 43'. N. Long. 85\u00b0. 5'. E.\n\nThis town stands on the south bank of the Boori Gunduck River, which has its source in the neighbourhood of Somaisir, and is navigable during the greater part of the year for boats of considerable burden, as high up as Sugouly. Its course, which is a very winding one, is through the districts of Bettiah, Champaran, and Hajipur. The appellation of Boori Gunduck is chiefly applied to it in the lower part of its course, where it joins the Bhagmutty. In a commercial point of view, the Boori Gunduck is entitled to particular notice; the great extent of its course, its depth, and communication with various other streams that issue from the adjacent hills, and intersect the forests, all fit it admirably for internal navigation.\n\nThe common boundary of the British and Nepaul territories on this side, may be described by a line drawn about midway between Edowra and Ullown. (Kirkpatrick, &c., &c.)\n\nShujahabad.\u2014A fortress in the province of Mooltan, situated about 18 miles distant from the city of Mooltan.\n\nSultangunge.\u2014A small town in the Nabob of Oude's territories, 42 miles N.

This is one of the principal towns in the Doabch Jallinder district.\nSULTANPOOR.\u2014A town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Khandesh, situated on the north side of the Tuptee River, 90 miles E. by N. from Surat. Lat. 21\u00b0 35'. N. Long. 74\u00b0 22'. E.\n\nSUMATRA.\n\nA large island in the Eastern Seas, divided obliquely by the equator into almost equal parts, and situated the most to the west of the Sunda chain of islands. Its northern point stretches into the Bay of Bengal; its S.W. coast is exposed to the great Indian Ocean; towards the S.E. it is separated by the Straits of Sunda from the Island of Java; on the east by the China and Eastern Seas from Borneo and other islands; and on the N.E. by the Straits of Malacca from the Malay Peninsula. In length it may be estimated at 1050 miles, by 165 miles the average breadth. Among the eastern people generally, and the better informed of the natives, this island is known by the names of Pulo Purichu and Indalas; the origin of the term Sumatra is uncertain. By Marco Polo it is called Java Minor.\n\nA chain of mountains runs through the whole extent of Sumatra, the ranges being, in many parts, double and treble; but, in general, situated much nearer to the western than to the opposite coast. The height of these mountains, although very great, is not sufficient to occasion their being covered with snow during any season of the year. Mount Ophir, situated immediately under the equinoctial line, is supposed to be the highest visible from the sea, above which level its summit is elevated 13,842 feet. The name was applied to the mountain by European navigators, is wholly unknown to the natives. Between these ridges of mountains are extensive plains, considerably elevated above the surface of the maritime lands, where the air is cool, and the country well cleared and inhabited. In the intermediate spaces between the ranges of hills are also many large and beautiful lakes, that extend, at intervals, through the heart of the country, and facilitate the communication; but their situation, direction, or dimensions, are very little known.\n\nThe western coast of Sumatra is extremely well supplied with water. Springs are found everywhere, and the rivers are numerous; but they are, in general, too small and rapid for the purposes of navigation. On the eastern coast, the mountains being at a greater distance from the sea, the rivers are of greater magnitude. The largest, on the western coast, are the Kataun, the Indrapura, the Tabayong, and the Sinkel; which are inferior to the Palembang, the Jambee, the Indragiri, and the Siak, of the eastern coast.\n\nThe chain of islands lying parallel to the west coast of Sumatra, probably at some remote period, formed a part of the main, as the whole coast exhibits marks of the progress of insolation. This probability is corroborated by the direction of the islands, the similarity of rock, soil, and productions, and the regularity of soundings between them and the main, while beyond them the depth is unfathomable. The sea appears to encroach on the northern coast, while it restores the land on the southern. The production of islands on this coast, by the rapid increase of the coral, is a remarkable operation of nature, experience having ascertained the formation of islands from this cause. Numerous clusters of islands on the Eastern Seas are supported on bases of coral, and surrounded by shoals emerging from the surface. On the west coast of this island the tides are estimated to rise no more than four feet, owing to its open, unconfined situation, which prevents an accumulation of the tides, as happens in narrow seas.\nThe whole south-east extremity of Sumatra is little more than a forest of mangroves growing out of a morass. This tree extends its roots, in a curved direction, into the water from different parts of the trunk, forming arches to some distance until they reach the bottom, covered by the sea. To these roots, or inverted branches, oysters and other small shell fish are found to adhere; and this circumstance has given rise to the assertion sometimes hazarded, of oysters growing upon trees. On this coast pieces of the land, torn from the shore by the violence of the river floods, with their shrubs and plants growing on them, are seen driving about with the wind and current, the roots being so closely matted and interwoven together, as to retain a quantity of earth.\n\nOn the west coast of Sumatra, southward of the equinoctial, the S. E. monsoon, or dry season, begins about May, and slackens in September. The N. W. monsoon begins about November, and the hard rains cease about March. The monsoons there, for the most part, commence and leave off gradually; the months of April and May, October and November, generally affording variable weather and winds. On this island, as well as other tropical countries of considerable extent, the wind uniformly blows from the sea to the land for a certain number of hours in the 24, and then changes, and blows for about as many from the land to the sea. The air is, in general, more temperate than in many regions beyond the tropics. The thermometer is seldom known to rise higher in the shade than $85^\\circ$, and at sunrise is usually so low as $70^\\circ$. Inland, among the hills, the thermometer has been known so low as $40^\\circ$, the cold felt being much greater than that number of degrees usually indicates. Frost and snow are unknown to the inhabitants; but fogs are very prevalent, and surprisingly dense.\n\nIn Sumatra there are a number of volcano mountains, named, in the Malay language, Goonong-api. Lava has been seen to flow from a considerable one near Priaman, but without causing any other damage than burning the woods. Earthquakes are frequent, but in general very slight. No connexion betwixt them and the volcanoes has ever been discovered. The water-spout often occurs along the coast, and frequently makes its appearance on land. Thunder and lightning are so frequent, as scarcely to attract attention; few instances of damage, or loss of lives, are ever experienced.\n\nThe soil on the western coast of Sumatra is generally a stiff, reddish clay, covered with a layer of black mould of no considerable depth. From this springs a strong and perpetual verdure of rank grass, brush wood, or timber trees, so that a great proportion of the island, especially to the southward, is an impervious forest. Along the west coast the low country is rendered very uneven by swamps.\n\nThe earth in Sumatra is rich in minerals, and other fossil productions; and the island has, in all ages, been famous for gold, which still continues to be procured in considerable quantities, and might be greatly increased if the gatherers had a competent knowledge of mineralogy. There are also mines of copper, iron, and tin. Sulphur is collected in large quantities among the numerous volcanoes. The natives extract saltpetre from the impregnated earth, which is chiefly found in extensive caves that have been long frequented by birds and bats, from whose dung the soil is formed, and acquires its nitrous properties. Coal, mostly washed down by the floods, is procured in many parts, particularly at Kuttaa, Ayer, Rami, and Bencoolen; but it is light, and not considered of a good quality. Mineral and hot springs, in taste resembling those of Harrowgate, are\nfound in many districts. Earth oil, used chiefly as a preservative against the destructive ravages of the white ant, is collected at Ipu and elsewhere. There is scarcely any species of hard rock to be met with in the low parts of the island, near the sea-shore, in the cliffs along which various petrifications and sea-shells are discovered.\n\nCopper is found on the hills of Mucky, near the sea, between Analaboo and Soosoo, to the north of the English settlement at Tappanooly. The space affording the ore is considerable, extending above a degree in length, and farther east into the country than has been yet ascertained. A considerable quantity of rich copper ore is found on the surface of the hills, to which the natives at present limit their researches. On analyzation it is found to contain a considerable portion of gold.\n\nRice is the most important article of cultivation in Sumatra. In the husk it is called Paddy by the Malays, from whose language the word seems to have found its way to the maritime parts in India. The kinds of rice are very numerous, but may be divided into two comprehensive classes\u2014the upland, or dry rice, and the lowland, or marshy rice. The natives generally prefer the small grained rice, when at the same time it is white, and in some degree transparent. In some parts of the island vegetation is so strong, that spots which have been perfectly cleared for cultivation will, upon being neglected for a single season, afford shelter to the beasts of the forest. The nominal time allowed, from the sowing to the reaping of the crop of the upland rice, is five lunar months and 10 days; but from this it must necessarily vary with the circumstances of the season. The innumerable springs and rivulets with which the country abounds, render unnecessary the laborious processes by which water is supplied on the continent of India, where the soil is sandy.\n\nIn the country of Manna, south from Bengoolen, superior attainments in agriculture are discovered, pieces of land, from five to 15 acres, being there seen enclosed, and regularly ploughed and harrowed. Under very favourable circumstances, the rate of produce is said to rise as high as 140; but the common produce is only 30 for one. The grains of paddy are rubbed out with the feet, which is a very painful and awkward mode of clearing the rice from the ear. The upland rice does not keep more than 12 months, and the lowland rice shews signs of decay in six months; but, in the husk, both will keep much longer. The northern part of the coast, under the Aceh government, produce large quantities of rice.\n\nThe next important object is the cocoa nut tree, which, with the betel nut and bamboo, require little cultivation. There is also the sago tree, and a great variety of palms. The sugar cane is very generally cultivated, but not in large quantities, and more frequently for the purpose of chewing the juicy reed, than for the manufacture of sugar, which is usually imported from Java. Maize, chilly pepper, turmeric, ginger, coriander and cumin seed, are raised in the gardens of the natives. Hemp is extensively cultivated, not for the purpose of making ropes, but an intoxicating preparation, called bang, which they smoke with tobacco. Small plantations of the latter plant are everywhere met with.\n\nIt is impossible to enumerate, within moderate bounds, all the plants and shrubs this luxuriant island produces; the following are the most remarkable:\u2014a dwarf species of mulberry is planted for silk worms, which are reared, but not to any great extent, and the raw article produced is of an inferior quality. The castor oil plant grows wild in abundance, especially near the sea-shore; and the elastic gum vine, or caoutchouc is also found,\nFrom the indigo plant the dye is extracted, and generally used in a liquid state. Brazil wood is common in Malay countries, as is also nubar, a red wood resembling logwood in its properties.\n\nThe mangosteen (garcinia mangostana), called by the natives mangista, exclusively belongs to these countries, and has, by general consent, obtained, in the opinion of Europeans, the pre-eminence among Indian fruits. Its characteristic quality is extreme delicacy of flavour, without being rich or luscious. Several species of the bread fruit tree, the jack, mango, plantains, pine apples (which the natives eat with salt), oranges, guavas, custard apples, paw-paws, tamarinds, cashew apples, pomegranates, and a multitude of other fruits without European names, are produced on this island. Grapes are raised by Europeans, but not cultivated by the natives; and there is a great profusion of flowers of a strong fragrance, and odoriferous shrubs. The camphor tree grows principally on the N.W. side of Sumatra, from the line to 3\u00b0 N. nearly, and is not found to the south of the equator. It is highly probable that, in the course of time, the price of camphor will rise enormously, as not one tree in 300 is found to contain camphor, and when found is immediately cut down. The wood is useful for domestic purposes, being soft, and easily worked.\n\nThe pulu upas, or poison tree, about which so many extraordinary tales have been told, is found in the woods. The poison is certainly deleterious, but not so potent as has been represented. The tree itself does no manner of harm to those around it; and persons may sit under its shade, or birds light on it, without sustaining the slightest injury.\n\nThe quadrupeds of this island are generally such as are found elsewhere in the east. The buffaloe supplies milk, butter, and beef, and is the only animal employed in domestic labour. While working, it is extremely slow, but steady; the work it performs, however, falls short of what might have been expected, from its size and apparent strength. They are not found in a wild state, being too much exposed to the attacks of the tiger; but only the weaker sort and females fall a prey to this savage, as the sturdy male buffaloe can withstand the first vigorous blow from the tiger's paw, on which the issue of the battle usually turns. The Sumatran tiger is of a very large size; some have been known to measure 18 inches across the forehead. Their chief subsistence is, probably, the unfortunate monkeys, with which the woods abound.\n\nThe cow, called Sapi and Jawi, is obviously a stranger to the country, and does not appear to be yet naturalized. The breed of horses is small, well made, and hardy, and are brought down by the country people nearly in a wild state. In the Batia country they are eaten, which is a custom also in Celebes. The sheep are a small breed, probably imported from Bengal; the other animals are the goat and hog, both domestic and wild, the otter, the cat, the rat, and the dog. Of the latter, those brought from Europe degenerate, in the course of time, to curs, with erect ears.\n\nThe elephants in the forests are numerous, but excepting a few kept for state by the King of Acehceu, they are not domesticated in any part of the country; rhinoceroses, single and double horned, are also found. The horn is esteemed an antidote against poison by the natives, and on that account made into drinking cups. The hippopotamus is found in Sumatra, and also the bear, which is small and black, and climbs the cocoa nut trees in order to devour the tender part or cabbage. There are many species of the deer kind, and the varieties of the monkey tribes are innumerable; here are also sloths, squirrels,\nteleggos, or stinkards, civet cats, tiger cats, porcupines, hedge hogs, pangolins, bats of all kinds, alligators, guanos, caneceous, flying lizards, tortoises, and turtle. The house lizards are in length from four inches down to one, and are the largest reptiles that can walk in an inverted position; one of these large enough to devour a cockroach, runs along the ceiling of a room, and in that situation seizes its prey. The tail of these reptiles when broken off renews itself.\n\nWith animals of the frog kind the swamps everywhere teem, and their noise on the approach of rain is tremendous. They furnish food to the snakes, which are of all sizes, and a great proportion of them harmless. These reptiles will swallow animals twice or thrice their own apparent circumference, having in their throats a compressive force that gradually reduces the prey to convenient dimensions. The shores supply cray fish, prawns, shrimps, crabs, the kina, or gigantic cockle, an inferior species of oyster, mussels, sea eggs, &c. &c. Among the fish are the dnyong, a large sea animal of the mammalia order, with two strong pectoral fins serving for the purposes of feet, the grampus whale, violiers, so called from the peculiarity of its dorsal fin resembling a sail, sharks, skates, the murana, gymnus, rock cod, pomfret, mullet, the flying fish, and many others.\n\nThe variety of birds is considerable, and consists of the Sumatran pheasant, peacocks, eagles and vultures, kites and crows, jackdaws, king's fishers, the buccos, storks, the common fowl, domestic and wild, the snipe, coot, plover, pigeons, quails, starlings, swallows, minas, parrots and parroquets, geese, ducks, teal, &c. The bird of Paradise is not found here, and the cassowary is brought from Java. The loory is brought from the islands still further east.\n\nThe whole island swarms with insects, amongst which are cockroaches, crickets, bees, flies of all sorts, mosquitoes, scorpions, centipedes, and water and land leeches. The fire fly is larger than the common fly, and emits light as if by respiration, which is so great, that words on paper may be distinguished by holding one in the hand. Ants exist in immense numbers and varieties, which differ in taste from each other when put into the mouth. Some are hot and acrid, some bitter, and some sour. The large red ant bites severely, and usually leaves its head, as the bee its sting, in the wound. The Chinese dainty, named indiscriminately biche de mar, swal-lo, tripan, or sea stag (holothurion) is collected from the rocks, and dried in the sun for the China market.\n\nOf the productions of Sumatra which are regarded as articles of commerce, the most abundant, and formerly the most important, is pepper, of which the East India Company used to export large quantities, but it is now reduced to one solitary cargo annually of the value of about 15,000l. The pepper vine is a hardy plant, growing readily from cuttings or layers, rising in several small knotted stems, and twining round any neighbouring support. If suffered to run along the ground its fibres become roots, in which case, like the ivy, it would never exhibit any marks of fructification. It begins to bear in its third, and attains its prime in its seventh year, after which it declines. The white pepper is made by bleaching the grains of the common sort, by which it is deprived of its exterior pellicle. This article takes little damage by submersion in sea water.\n\nOn the capture of the Moluccas, in 1796, the nutmeg and clove plants were introduced, and have since rapidly increased, particularly the former. There are now above 20,000 nutmeg trees in full bearing, capable of yielding annually 200,000 pounds, and 56,000 pounds of mace. Among the most valuable productions of the island is camphor, for which Suma-\ntra and Borneo have been celebrated from the earliest times. The tree is sometimes 15 feet in circumference, the camphor being found in a concrete state in the natural fissures and crevices of the wood. The natives cut down a great many trees at random before they find one that contains a sufficient quantity to repay their labour, although always assisted in their research by a professional conjurer, whose skill must be chiefly employed in concealing or accounting for his own mistakes. The whole quantity brought for sale rarely exceeds 50 peculs (393\u00bd pounds each). The trade is chiefly in the hands of the Aceeneese, who buy the article from the Batta people, and dispose of it to the Europeans and Chinese. The Japan camphor is of a very inferior quality.\n\nBenzoin, or benjamin, is found almost exclusively in the Batta country. The best sort is sent to Europe, and the inferior sort is exported to Arabia, Persia, and some parts of Hindostan, where it is burned to perfume their temples and private houses. From England it is re-exported to the Roman Catholic and Mahommedan countries, to be used as incense. It is also employed in medicine as a styptic, and constitutes the basis of Turlington's drops. Cassia is also produced and exported, and rattans furnish annually many cargoes. The annual and the shrub cotton are cultivated by the natives, but only in sufficient quantities to supply their own wants. The silk cotton is a most beautiful raw material, but owing to the shortness and brittleness of the staple is unfit for the reel and the loom, and is only applied to the unworthy purposes of stuffing pillows and matresses. The coffee tree is universally planted, but the berry is not of a good quality, probably owing to the want of skill in the management. Among the other articles of commerce are dammer, a species of turpentine or resin; dragons' blood, a drug obtained from a large species of rattan; gambir, a juice extracted from the leaves of a plant of the same name. Lignum aloes, or agila wood, highly prized in the east for its fragrant scent while burning.\n\nThe forests contain an inexhaustible store and endless variety of timber trees, many sorts of which are capable of being applied to ship building; but the teak does not appear to be indigenous to the island, although it flourishes to the northward and southward, in Pegu and Java. The other remarkable trees are the poon, so named from a Malay word, which signifies wood in general, and is preferred for masts and spars. The camphor wood is used for carpenters' purposes. The iron wood, so named on account of its hardness. The marbau, used as beams for ships and houses. The pinaga, valuable as crooked timber from frames and knees. The ebony; the kayu gadis, a wood possessing the flavour and qualities of sassafras; the rangi, supposed to be the manchineel tree of the West Indies, has a resemblance to mahogany. Of the various sorts of trees producing dammer, some are also valuable as timber, and here also is found the spreading banyan tree of Hindostan.\n\nGold is procured in the central parts of the island, and Menanca-bow has always been esteemed the richest in this metal. In the districts inland from Padang, which is the principal mart, it is collected from mines, and from the channels of rivers; pieces of gold have also occasionally been found, weighing nine ounces and upwards. Probably only one half of all the gold procured reaches the hands of Europeans; yet it is asserted, on good authority, that from 10 to 12,000 ounces have been annually received at Padang alone, at Nalaboo 2000, at Natal 800, and at Mocomoco 600. The merchants carry the gold from the interior to the sea coast, where they barter it for iron and iron working tools, opium, and the fine piece goods of Madras and Bengal. When\nbought at the settlements, it used formerly to be purchased at the rate of 3l. 5s. per ounce, but afterwards rose to 3l. 18s. which would yield no profit on exportation to Europe. In many parts of the country it is employed instead of coin, every man carrying a small pair of scales about with him. At Acheen small thin gold coins were formerly struck, but the coinage has been abandoned in modern times. Silver is not known as a production of Sumatra.\n\nTin is a very considerable article of trade, the mines of which are situated on the Island of Banca. Iron ore is dug on Sumatra, but not in large quantities, the consumption of the natives being supplied with English and Swedish bar iron. Sulphur is procured from the volcanoes, and yellow arsenic is an article of traffic. In the country of Kuttaum are extensive caves, from the soil of which saltpetre is extracted; and from similar caverns the edible bird nests are procured for the China market, where also the biche de mar is sent, and is there employed as a seasoning. At Batavia the last article sells for 45 dollars per pood of 133\u00bd pounds. The other exports are bees' wax, gum lac, and ivory. Elephants were formerly exported from Acheen to the Coromandel Coast, in vessels built on purpose, but this trade has long declined.\n\nThe most general articles of import are the following. From the Coast of Coromandel various cotton goods, such as long cloth, blue and white chintzes, coloured handkerchiefs, and also salt. From Bengal muslins, striped and plain; and several kinds of cotton goods, as batas, cossacs, hummums, &c., taffetas and some other silks, and opium in considerable quantities. From the western Coast of India various cotton goods, mostly of a coarse fabric. From China coarse porcelain, iron pans in sets of different sizes, tobacco shred very fine, gold threads, fans, and a number of small articles. From Celebes (known here by the name of its chief provinces, Macassar, Buggess, and Mandar), Java, Bally, Cerani, and other eastern islands, the rough striped cotton cloth, commonly called Buggess clouting; the universal body dress of the natives; creeses, and other weapons; silken creese belts, tudongs, or hats, small pieces of ordnance, commonly of brass, called rantaka, spices, salt of a large grain, and sometimes rice, chiefly from Bali. From Europe are imported silver, iron, steel, lead, cutlery, various sorts of hardware, brass wire, and broad cloths, especially scarlet.\n\nThe beautiful gold and silver filagree work of Sumatra has long been celebrated and admired, and is a matter of still greater curiosity from the extreme coarseness of the tools employed in the manufacture. From a piece of old iron hoop the wire drawing instrument is made, a hammer head stuck in a block serves for an anvil; and a pair of compasses is seen composed of two old nails tied together at one end. The gold is fused in a piece of a rice pot; in general they use no bellows, but blow the fire with their mouths through a joint of bamboo. If the quantity of gold to be melted be considerable, three or four persons sit around their furnace, which is an old iron pot, and blow altogether.\n\nBut little skill is shewn by the natives in forging iron. They make nails, although seldom used in building. They are ignorant of the use of the saw, except where it has been introduced by the Europeans. Painting and drawing they are strangers to; in carving they are fanciful, and their designs grotesque, and always out of nature. Silk and cotton cloths manufactured by themselves are worn by the natives in all parts of the country. Their looms and weaving apparatus are extremely defective. They manufacture different kinds of earthenware of a coarse fabric; and extract the cocoa nut oil, which is in general use. Gunpowder is manufactured in various\nparts of the island, but less in the southern provinces than among the people of Menancabow, the Battas, and the Acheenese, whose frequent wars demand large supplies. The powder is very imperfectly granulated, being often hastily prepared in small quantities for immediate use. Salt is mostly supplied by cargoes imported, but they also manufacture it themselves by a very tedious process.\n\nAmong the modern political divisions of the island, the principal are the empire of Menancabow and the Malays; in the next place, the Acheenese; then the Battas, the Rejangs; and next to them the people of Lampung. The chain of islands which extends in a line nearly parallel to the western coast, at the distance of little more than a degree, are inhabited by a race, or races of people, apparently from the same original stock as those of the interior of Sumatra. Their genuineness of character has been preserved to a remarkable degree, whilst the islands on the eastern side are uniformly peopled with Malays. Until about 100 years ago the southern Coast of Sumatra, as far as the Urei River, was dependant on the King of Bantam in Java, whose lieutenant came yearly to Bengoolen, or Sillebar, to collect pepper, and fill up the vacancies.\n\nAlmost all the forms of government throughout Sumatra are a mixture of the feudal and patriarchal; but the system of government among the people near the sea coast is much influenced by the power of the Europeans, who exercise, in fact, the functions of sovereignty, and with great advantage to their subjects. The districts over which the East India Company's influence extends are preserved in a state of uninterrupted peace, and were it not for this coercion, every village would be in a state of perpetual hostility with its neighbour. The form of government among the Rejangs applies generally to the Orang ulu, or inhabitants of the interior. Among the hills and woods property in land depends upon occupancy, unless where fruit trees have been planted; and as there is seldom any determined boundary between neighbouring villages, such marks are rarely disturbed.\n\nThe laws of the Sumatrans are properly a set of long established customs handed down to them from their ancestors, the authority for which is founded in usage and general consent. The law which renders all the members of a family reciprocally bound for each other's debts, forms a strong connexion among them. When a man dies, his effects descend to his children in equal shares. The Sumatran code admits of a pecuniary compensation for murder, on which account their laws take no cognizance of the distinction between a wilful murder and what we term manslaughter. Corporal punishment of any kind is rare.\n\nThe place of the greatest solemnity for administering an oath, is the burying ground of their ancestors; and they have certain reliques, or swearing apparatus, which they produce, on important occasions. These generally consist of an old broken creese, a broken gun barrel, some copper bullets, or any thing else to which chance or caprice has annexed the idea of extraordinary virtue. These they generally dip in water, which the person who swears drinks off, after pronouncing a form of words. At Manna the relique most venerated is a gun barrel, which, when produced to be sworn on, is carried to the spot wrapt up in silk, and under an umbrella. The Sumatran impressed with the idea of invisible powers, but not of his own immortality, regards with awe the supposed instruments of their agency, and swears on creeses, bullets, and gun barrels, weapons of personal destruction.\n\nThe right of slavery is established in this island, as it is universally throughout the east; but few in-\nstances occur of the country people actually having slaves, although they are common in the Malayan or seaport towns. At Bengooleu the East India Company have a body of negro slaves. These hold the natives of the island in great contempt, have an antipathy to them, and enjoy any occasion of doing them mischief; the Sumatrans, on the other hand, consider the negroes merely as devils half humanized.\n\nThe inhabitants of Sumatra are rather below the middle size, their limbs are, for the most part, slight, but well shaped, and are particularly small at the wrists and ankles. The women follow the preposterous custom of flattening the noses and compressing the skulls of children newly born, and also pull out the ears of the infants to make them stand at an angle with the head. The males destroy their beards, and keep their chins remarkably smooth. Their complexion is properly yellow, wanting the red tinge that constitutes a tawny or copper colour. The females of the upper classes not exposed to the rays of the sun, approach to a degree of fairness. Persons of superior rank encourage the growth of their hand nails to an extraordinary length; the hands of the natives generally, and even those of the half breed, are always cold. The inland natives are superior in size and strength to the Malays on the coast, and possess also fairer complexions. Among the hills the inhabitants are subject to monstrous wens, or goitres on the throat.\n\nBoth sexes have the extraordinary custom of filing and disfiguring their teeth, which are naturally very white and beautiful, from the simplicity of their food. Many, particularly the women of the Lampong country, have their teeth rubbed down even with their gums; others have them formed into points, while some file off no more than the outer extremities, and then blacken them with the empyreumatic oil of the cocoa nut shell. The great men set their teeth in gold, by casing with a plate of that metal the under row; which ornament, contrasted with the black dye, has by candle light a very splendid effect. It is sometimes indented to the shape of their teeth, but more usually is quite plain, and it is not removed either to sleep or eat. The original clothing of the Sumatrans is the same with that found by navigators among the South Sea Islands, and in Europe generally called Otaheitean cloth. It is still used among the Rejangs as their working dress, but the country people now, in a great measure, conform to the costume of the Malays.\n\nThe dusuns, or villages of the Sumatrans, for the inhabitants are so few that they are not entitled to the name of towns, are always situated on the banks of a river or lake, for the convenience of bathing, and of transporting goods. Their buildings are of wood and bamboos, covered with palm leaves. The frames of the houses rest on stout wooden pillars, about six or eight feet in height, and are ascended to by a piece of stout bamboo cut into notches. Detached buildings in the country are raised 10 or 12 feet from the ground, as security against tigers. The furniture is extremely simple, and neither knives nor forks are required, as in eating they take up the rice and other victuals between the thumb and fingers, and throw it into the mouth by the action of the thumb.\n\nThe art of medicine among the Sumatrans consists almost entirely in the application of simples. Every old man and woman is a physician, and their rewards depend on their success, but they generally procure a small sum in advance, under the pretext of purchasing charms. In fevers during the paroxysm, they pour over the patient a quantity of very cold water, which afterwards brings on a copious perspiration. The venereal disease, although common in the Malay bazars, is little known in the interior.\nOn the sea coast the Malay language is intermixed with the Batta, and other original languages. The Malays fix the length of the year at 354 days, or 12 lunar months of 29\u00bd days each; the original Sumatrans count their years from the number of their crops of grain. They are fond of music, and have many instruments, mostly borrowed from the Chinese. The Malays of Sumatra use the Arabic character, and have incorporated a great many Arabic, and also Portuguese words, in their language. The other principal languages of Sumatra are the Batta, the Rejang, and the Lampong; the difference between them being chiefly marked by their being expressed in distinct written characters. They write on the inner bark of a tree, and on bamboos, and form their lines from the left hand towards the right.\n\nThe native Sumatran of the interior differs in some respects from the Malay of the coast, being mild, peaceable, and forbearing, unless when roused by violent provocation. He is temperate and sober, his diet being mostly vegetable, and his only beverage water. Their hospitality is very great with very simple manners; and they are, in general, except among the chiefs, devoid of the Malay cunning and chicane. On the other hand, they are litigious, indolent, addicted to gaming, dishonest in their dealings with strangers, which they consider as no moral defect, regardless of truth, mean, servile; and though cleanly in their persons, filthy in their apparel, which they never wash. They are careless and improvident of the future, and make no advances in improving their condition. The Macassars and Bug-gesses who come annually from Celebes in their prows to trade at Sumatra, are looked up to by the Sumatrans and Malays as their superiors in manners. They also derive part of the respect paid to them from the richness of their cargoes, and the spirit with which they spend the produce in gaming, cock fighting, and smoking opium.\n\nThrough every rank of the people there prevails a strong propensity to gaming, and to cock fighting they are still more passionately addicted. The artificial spur used resembles the blade of a scimitar, and proves a more destructive weapon than the European spur. The Malay breed of cocks are much esteemed by connoisseurs who have had an opportunity of trying them. In some places they match quails in the manner of cocks, which fight with great inveteracy, and endeavour to seize each other by the tongue.\n\nThe Sumatrans generally, but more particularly the Malays, are much addicted to the custom of smoking opium. The poppy which produces it not growing on the island, it is annually imported from Bengal in considerable quantities, in chests of 140 pounds each, and on the west coast about 20,000 pounds are used annually. It is mixed up with tobacco into the form of pills about the size of a pea, which quantity is consumed at one whiff. The smoke is never emitted by the mouth, but usually receives vent through the nostrils, and sometimes by adepts through the passages of the ears and eyes. Although so much opium is smoked in this island, the practice of running a muck (called by the natives mengamok) is by no means frequent. It is remarkable that at Batavia, where the criminals when taken alive are broken on the wheel with every aggravation of cruelty, mucks often occur; while at Bengoolen, where they are executed in the easiest manner, the offence is extremely rare. On the west coast the Malays have been so long accustomed to the mild government of the British, that their manners and habits are considerably improved; while on the east coast they continue ferocious, sanguinary, and treacherous.\n\nThe original Sumatran vessel for boiling rice, and which is still used\nfor that purpose is a joint of green bamboo. By the time the rice is dressed, the utensil is nearly destroyed by the fire; but it resists the flame so long, as there is no moisture within. Although the natives subsist in a great measure on vegetable food, they are not restrained by any prejudice of caste from other aliments; and accordingly, at their entertainments, the flesh of the buffaloe, the goat, and fowls, are served up. Their dishes are almost all dressed as curries, and their flesh meat is cooked immediately after it is killed, which is still warm. Sago, although common, is not in such general use as among the more eastern islands, where it is employed as a substitute for rice. When these articles of subsistence fail, the Sumatran finds others in the woods; hence famines in the island are never attended with any very destructive consequences.\n\nThe natives of Sumatra are in general good speakers, the gift of oratory being natural to them. A Sumatran ever scrupulously abstains from pronouncing his own name, not from any motive of superstition, but merely as a punctilio in manners; and it occasions him infinite embarrassment when a stranger, unacquainted with their customs, requires it of him. As soon as he recovers from his confusion he solicits the interposition of his neighbour. They can seldom give an accurate account of their age; but, so far as can be inferred from observation, not a great proportion of the men attain the age of 50, and 60 is accounted a long life. Where Mahommedanism prevails, boys are circumcised between the sixth and tenth years.\n\nThe ancient genuine religion of the Rejangs, (the Sumatran race with which we are best acquainted) if in fact they ever had any, is now scarcely to be traced; and what adds to the difficulty of procuring information is, that those who have not been initiated in the Mahommedan doctrines regard those who have, as persons advanced a step in knowledge beyond them. If by religion is meant a public or private form of worship of any kind, and of prayers, processions, meetings; offerings, images, or priests, are all or any of them necessary to constitute it; the Rejangs are totally without religion, and cannot with propriety be even termed pagans, if that phrase is understood to convey the idea of mistaken worship. They neither worship God, devil, nor idol. They are not, however, without superstitious beliefs of many kinds; and have a confused notion, though perhaps derived from their intercourse with other people, of some superior beings who have the power of rendering themselves visible and invisible at pleasure. These they call orang alus, fine or impalpable beings, and regard them as possessing the faculty of doing them good or evil. They also call them malekat and jin, which are the angels and evil spirits of the Arabians, and the idea was probably borrowed at the same time with the name. They have no word in their language to express the person of God except the \"Alah tala\" of the Malays, corrupted by them to \"Ulah talo.\" The Sumatrans, where untinctured with Mahommedanism, do not appear to have any notion of a future state.\n\nThe superstition which has the strongest influence on their minds, and which approaches the nearest to a species of religion, is that which leads them to venerate, almost to the point of worshipping, the tombs and names of their deceased ancestors. They have an imperfect notion of a metempsychosis, but not in any degree systematic, nor considered as an article of religious faith. They seem to think in general that tigers are actuated by the spirits of deceased men, and speak of them with a degree of awe. They relate stories also of a place in the interior country, where the tigers have a court, and maintain a regular form of government, and have their houses thatched with women's hair. The Suma-\ntrans are also firmly persuaded, that various particular persons are what they term betuah (sacred, impassive, invulnerable, and not liable to accident); and this quality they extend to things inanimate, such as ships and boats.\n\nNo attempts have ever been made by missionaries, or others, to convert the inhabitants of this island to Christianity. Of the many thousands baptized in the Eastern Isles by the celebrated Francis Xavier, in the 16th century, not one of their descendants are now found to retain a ray of the light imparted to them. As it was novelty only, and not conviction, that induced the original converts to embrace a new faith, the impression lasted no longer than the sentiment which recommended it, and disappeared as rapidly as the missionary. Under the influence, however, of the Spanish government at Manilla, and of the Dutch at Batavia, there are many native Christians educated as such from their childhood. The neglect of missions to Sumatra is one of the causes that the interior of the country is so little known to the civilized world.\n\nLegal disputes are extremely common in Sumatra, and by far the greater number originate in the intricacy of the marriage contracts, the difficulties of which, both precedent and subsequent, are increased by the Sumatrans to a degree unknown in the most refined states. A wife is obtained by various modes of purchase, and when the full sum is paid the female becomes to all intents and purposes the slave of the husband, who may at any time sell her, making only the first offer to her relations. The debts due for these sales constitute in fact the chief part of their riches; and a person is reckoned in good circumstances who has several due to him for his daughters, sisters, aunts, and great aunts. Prostitution is unknown in the interior, being confined to the more polite bazars on the sea-coast, where there is usually a concourse of sailors and other strangers. Adultery is punishable by fine, but the crime is rare, and law-suits on the subject still less frequent. The husband, it is probable, either conceals his shame, or revenges it with his own hand. The customs of the Sumatrans permit their having as many wives as they can purchase, or afford to maintain; but it is only among their chiefs that instances occur of their having more than one.\n\nFrom various sources of information, sufficiently distinct from each other, the conclusion may be drawn, that the Mahommedan religion had not made any considerable progress in the interior of Sumatra earlier than the 14th century. The province of Menancabow, although situated inland, is by far the most completely converted, the inhabitants being wholly Mahommedans. Perhaps it is less surprising that this one kingdom should have been completely converted, than that so many districts should remain to this day without any religion whatever. Every thing conspires to induce the Sumatran to embrace a system of belief, and scheme of instruction, in which there is nothing repugnant to prejudices already imbibed; he relinquishes no favourite ancient worship to adopt a new, and is manifestly a gainer by the exchange. (Marsden, &c.)\n\nSumaun.\u2014A town in the province of Agra, district of Etaweh, 28 miles N.N.E. from the town of Etaweh. Lat. 27\u00b0. 6'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 5'. E.\n\nSumbhawa.\u2014A large island in the Eastern Seas, situated between the eighth and ninth degrees of south latitude, and separated from Lombhook by the Straits of Allass; in length it may be estimated at 180 miles, by 40 the average breadth. Near the middle it is deeply indented by an extensive bay, which almost divides it into two portions.\n\nThe petty states on this island are Bima, Dompo, Tambora, Sangar, Papikat, and Sumbhawa. Their chiefs were all either the allies of,\nor under the protection of the Dutch East India Company; and were all sufficiently obedient, except the last-mentioned state, which was refractory, being instigated thereto by the Macassars and Wadjorese of Celebes, who resort in great numbers to this island, especially the latter. Country ships here procure articles of trade for the China market; and, in 1778, sapan wood to the amount of 580,000 pounds weight was exported from this island, and sold in Holland. The Dutch trade to Sumbawa was under the superintendence of the Macassar residency.\n\nBima lies at the east end of Sumbhawa, and comprehends under its jurisdiction the Straits of Sapu, the whole of Manjeray, and the Island of Goonong Api. The Bima language extends over the east part of Sumbhawa, and the western portion of the Island of Ende, denominated Floris by the early Portuguese navigators. The dialect of Sumbhawa, which prevails in the districts not subject to the Sultan of Bima, is of a more mixed character than that of Bima. Neither the latter, nor the Sumbhawa, have any peculiar character, but use indifferently the Buginese or Malay characters. (Stavrovinus and Notes, Leyden, Elmore, &c.)\n\nSumbhoonaauthi, (Sambhunatha, a Name of Mahadeva).\u2014A town and temple in the Ghoorkhali territories, in Nepaul. Lat. 27\u00b0.35' N. Long. 85\u00b0.38' E.\n\nThe temple of Sumbhoonaauthi is a very ancient edifice, having been erected when Nepaul was subject to a Tibetan race, who, having been subsequently expelled by the Ne-war, obtained the name of Khat Bhootcas (or Bhooteas of Catmandoo), which they still preserve. At present they occupy the Kutchar mountains. The possession of the temple has always been claimed by the Delai Lama (the sovereign pontiff of Lehassa), as a dependency on his spirituality from the earliest times. Upon the rupture which took place some years ago between the Tibetans and the people of Nepaul, the lamas view was obliged to evacuate the sanctuary, which was afterwards held on the part of the Deb Rajah of Bootan.\n\nThe temple principally visited by the Bootias and Balauras, is on the terrace of a hill, and is distinguished at a great distance by its spires or turrets, covered with plates of copper, and highly gilt. Sumbhoonaauthi is chiefly celebrated for its perpetual fire, the priests asserting, that the flame of the two largest lamp wicks have been preserved from time immemorial. (Kirhpatrik, &c.)\n\nSumbhulpoor, (Sambhalpura).\u2014A district in the province of Gundwana, situated between the 21st and 22d parallels of north latitude. This territory takes its name from the capital, but the rajah is styled Rajah Autaraghur, or the Rajah of 18 Forts. It is bounded on the west by the district of Ruttunpoor and Boora Shumbur; to the east by Bimbere, Landacoli, and Boad; to the south by Patna and Coondon; and on the north by Gangpoor and Sirgoojah.\n\nThe air of Sumbhulpoor is very unwholesome, owing to the quantity of jungle, and the vicissitudes of heat and cold. The soil in the valleys is a rich loam, in which grain, or pulse, thrive well; and in the mountains gold and diamonds are found. The natives wash the sand of the rills that descend from them, and procure considerable quantities of gold. The diamonds are found about 13 miles beyond Sumbhulpoor, near the junction of the River Hebe with the Mahanuddy. At this place, after the rains, the natives search in the River Hebe for red earth, washed down from the mountains, in which earth the diamonds are discovered. The matrix containing the diamonds is a clay, which appears burned red, nearly to the degree bricks usually are. The natives in this part of Gundwana are miserably governed, and are described as being lazy, treacherous, and cruel.\nThe district of Sumbhulpoor was anciently comprehended in the Hindu division of Gundwana, and composed part of the state of Gurrab; but, during the reign of Aurungzebe, it was formally annexed to the soubah of Allahabad, although its subjugation to the Mogal government was little more than nominal. It afterwards fell under the sway of the Nagpoor Maharattas; and, during the war which took place, in 1803, between them and the British, possession was taken of it by the latter, as also the adjacent district of Patna, certain treaties being entered into with the feudatories, who held them under the Rajah of Nagpoor. On the 24th of August, 1806, adverting to the friendly relations then subsisting with the Nagpoor state, the British government agreed to restore to the rajah all the territories of Sumbhulpoor and Patna, with the exception of the country occupied by Rajah Jonjar Singh, which was to continue incorporated with the British dominions. The pergunnahs thus restored were Sumbhulpoor, Solnepoor, Sanmugur, Burgur, Saktee, Serakole, Benria, Bojee, Kautickpoor, Patna, Khas Patna, Nawagur, Ghareclanao, Tonageer, and Borasambre.\n\nIn 1807 the unexpected resistance made by the zemindars of Sumbhulpoor and Patna to the re-introduction of the Maharatta power, induced the Nagpoor state to solicit the assistance of the British government, being unable, owing to the extravagance of the Nagpoor Rajah, to raise funds to equip a sufficient force. Mr. Elphinstone, the British ambassador, was, in consequence, directed to interpose with the zemindars, and to endeavour to accomplish the peaceable restoration of the Maharatta authority. In this district is the tomb of Mr. Elliot, whose untimely death is lamented in Mr. Hastings' celebrated ode. (1st Reg. Treaties, MSS. J.

E.\n\nSumnaut,(Somanatha).\u2014See Puttan Sumnaut.\n\nSunda, (Straits of).\u2014The arm of the sea which separates the large islands of Sumatra and Java is known to Europeans by this name; by the Malays it is termed Sunda Kalapa. The length of this channel, taken from the flat point to Varkens, or Hog Point, is about 70 miles, and on the opposite coast, from Java Head to Bantam Point, about 90.\n\nIn the month of the straits lies Prince's Island, by the situation of which two passages are formed; one between Prince's Island and Java, which is made use of, for the most part, by ships which have to pass the straits during the south-east monsoon, in order that, sailing close in with the Java shore, they may soon get within anchoring depth, and escape all danger of being driven to sea with the currents, which at that time of the year set strongly out of the straits to the westward. The other passage, which is called by seamen the Great Channel, sometimes also serves as an entrance to the straits during the south-east monsoon, but it is with the greatest difficulty; and, after continual struggling with the south-easterly winds, and the current, that this can be effected.\n\nIn the narrowest part of the straits, and opposite to Hog's Point, on Su-\nmatra, lies an island, that, on account of its situation, has been called Thwart the Way, or Middle Isle. A strong current runs through the passage on both sides of this island during the whole year, setting with the prevailing easterly or westerly winds, either to the north-east or south-west.\n\nThe chief islands in the Straits of Sunda are Prince's Isle, Krakatau, Thwart the Way, and Pulo Baby. The others are very small and insignificant, mostly level, founded on beds of coral, and covered with trees. A few have steep, naked sides, and at a little distance resemble old castles, mouldering into ruins; but, on a nearer view, appear to be of volcanic origin. The Dutch East India Company claim an absolute sovereignty over the Straits of Sunda, but it never has been, in any respect, enforced. These pretensions originate from the circumstance of their superiority over the land on each side; Bantam on the Java shore, and Lampung on that of Sumatra. (Staverinus and Notes, &c.)\n\nSundeela.\u2014A town in the Nahab of Oude\u2019s territories, 30 miles N. W. from Lucknow. Lat. 27\u00b0 5'. N. Long. 80\u00b0 30'. E.\n\nSundeep Isle, (Somadwipa, Isle of the Moon).\u2014An island in the province of Bengal, district of Chittagong, which may be estimated at 16 miles in length, by eight the average breadth. Here there is a government establishment for the manufacture of salt, subordinate to the Bulwa and Chittagong agency.\n\nTowards the conclusion of the 16th century, a number of Portuguese settled on the coasts of Chittagong and Arracan, many of whom had entered into the service of the native princes, and obtained commands and grants of land. These adventurers were extirpated, or expelled, from Arracan about A.D. 1607, the few who escaped taking refuge among the islands, where they continued to practice piracy. Futeh Khan, the Mogul Governor of Sundeep, having attempted to suppress them, was himself defeated and killed, and his whole fleet captured. On this event the pirates elected for their chief a common sailor, named Sebastian Gonzales, and in 1609 gained possession of Sundeep, after massacring the garrison.\n\nSebastian, after this success, established an independent principality, his force amounting to 1000 Portuguese, 2000 native troops, 200 cavalry, and 80 vessels of different sizes, well supplied with cannon, with which he soon after added the adjacent Island of Shahabaspoor, and some others, to his dominions. With a little common prudence his power might have attained a great height, and been permanent, but he soon afterwards disgusted his own subjects, by the brutal tyranny of his government, and rendered the Moguls and Arracaners hostile by the perfidy of his conduct, and the merciless cruelty of his ravages. After many vicissitudes he was abandoned by the greater part of his followers, and in 1616 was defeated by the Rajah of Arracan, who conquered Sundeep and the other islands, from whence, under the name of Mughls, the Arracaners infested and desolated the lower district of Bengal, carrying off the inhabitants into slavery.\n\nThis island continued in possession of these barbarians until A.D. 1666, when Shaista Khan, the Mogul Governor of Bengal, having fitted out a strong fleet at Dacca, dispatched it down the Megna to attack Sundeep, where the Mughls had erected blockaded fortifications, which they defended with great resolution for a considerable time, but were at length all taken or destroyed. Since that period it remained attached to the Mogul government of Bengal, and devolved, along with that province, to the East India Company. (Stewart, &c.)\n\nSunderbunds, (Sanduri rana, a Wood of Swendry Trees).\u2014A woody\ntract of country on the sea-coast of Bengal, being part of the Delta of the Ganges, and extending along the Bay of Bengal about 180 miles. This dreary region is composed of a labyrinth of rivers and creeks, all of which are salt, except those that communicate immediately with the principal arm of the Ganges; these numerous natural canals being so disposed as to form a complete inland navigation. In tracing the seacoast of this Delta, there are eight openings found, each of which appears to be the principal mouth of the Ganges.\n\nAs a strong presumptive proof of the wandering of that river from one side of the Delta to the other, it may be observed, that there is no appearance of virgin earth between the Tipperah Hills on the east, and the district of Burdwan, on the west; nor below Dacca and Bau-leah to the north. In all the sections of the numerous creeks and rivers of the Delta, nothing appears but sand and black mould in regular strata, until the clay is reached that forms the lower part of their beds; nor is there any substance so coarse as gravel, either in the Delta, or nearer the sea than 400 miles (by the course of the Ganges) at Oudanulla, where a rocky point, part of the base of the neighbouring hills, projects into the river.\n\nThe navigation through the Sunderbunds is effected chiefly by means of the tides, there being two distinct passages; the one named the Southern or Sunderland Passage, and the other the Balliaghant Passage. The first is the furthest about, and leads through the widest and deepest rivers, and opens into the Hooghly or Calcutta River, about 65 miles below the town. The Balliaghant Passage opens into a lake on the east side of Calcutta. The navigation by these passages extends more than 200 miles through a thick forest, divided into numberless islands by a multitude of channels, so various in point of width, that a vessel has at one time her masts entangled among the branches of trees, and at other times sails on a broadly-expanded river, beautifully skirted with woods. The water is everywhere salt, and the whole forest abandoned to the wild beasts, except here and there a solitary fakir. During the dry season the lower shores of these rivers are visited by the salt-makers and woodcutters, who exercise their trade at the constant hazard of their lives; for tigers of the most enormous size not only appear on the margin, but frequently swim off to the boats that lie at anchor in the rivers. In addition to these the waters swarm with alligators. These passages are open throughout the year; and, during the season, when the stream of the Ganges is low, the whole trade of Bengal (the western districts excepted) passes either by Channel Creek, or by Balliaghant; but chiefly by the former.\n\nIt is not practicable to bring into culture these salt marshy lands, for the most part overflowed by the tide; nor is it desirable, while so much good land, in more healthy situations, remains imperfectly occupied. The existence of this forest also has always been considered of importance in a political view, as it presents a strong natural barrier along the southern frontier of Bengal. Great quantities of excellent salt are here manufactured, and esteemed of peculiar sanctity, as being extracted on the banks of the Ganges. The woods also present an inexhaustible supply of timber for fuel, boat-building, and other purposes.\n\nVarious derivations have been assigned to the name. By some it has been traced from Sundery, a species of tree; and also from the words, Soonder, beautiful, and Bon, a forest; by others the name is asserted to be Chunderbund, because the tract is still comprehended in the ancient zemindary of Chunderdeep. In 1784 the Sunderbunds, Cooch Bahar, and Rangamatty, all nearly waste, ac-\nording to Major Rennel, contained 37,549 square miles. (Rennel, J. Grant, Colebrooke, &c.)\n\nSundra\u00ebom.\u2014A small state lying within the bounds of Macassar on the Island of Celebes. The city stands a little inland on the banks of a river, whence its name originates. (Stavorinus, &c.)\n\nSungei Tenang.\u2014A country in the interior of Sumatra, situated between the 2d and 3d degrees of south latitude. The access to this territory is extremely difficult, on account of the different ranges of high mountains covered with forest trees and thick jungle that intervene. It is bounded on the N.W. by Korinchi and Serampei; on the W. and S.W. by the Anak Sungei, or Moconoco and Ypu district; on the S. by Laboon, and on the E. by Batang Asei and Pakatang-jambu.\n\nThe general produce of this country is maize, paddy, sweet potatoes, common potatoes, tobacco, and sugar-cane; and the valleys are, on the whole, well cultivated. The principal part of the clothing is procured from the eastern side of the island. The inhabitants are a thick, stout, dark race of people, something resembling the Acheenese, and in general addicted to the smoking of opium. They usually carry charms about their persons to preserve them from accident, some of which are printed at Batavia, or Samarang, in Java, in Dutch, Portuguese, and French. In addition to the preservation part, this document cautions purchasers against charms printed in London, as the English would endeavour to counterfeit them, and impose on the buyers, being all cheats.\n\nEvery village has a town-hall about 120 feet long, and broad in proportion; the woodwork of which is neatly carved. The dwelling-houses contain five, six, or seven families each, and the country is populous. The inhabitants, both of Sungei Tepang and Sermpei, are Mahomedans, and acknowledge themselves subject to Jambee. (Dare, &c.)\n\nSunta Bednore.\u2014A small town enclosed with a gurly wall and bound hedge, in the province of Mysore, 25 miles W. from Chitteldroog. Lat. 14\u00b0. 8'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 5'. E.

This place is pleasantly situated on the west side of the Gauges, on the margin of which many Hindoo temples and ghauts (landing places) are seen, some in ruins, while others are building.\n\nSurat, (Surasktra).\u2014A large and populous city in the province of Gujrat, situated on the south side of the Tuptee River, about 20 miles above its junction with the sea. Lat. 21\u00b0. 13'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 3'. E. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Sooret, containing 31 mahals, measurement 1,312,315 begahs, revenue 19,035,177 dams. Seyurghal 182,270 dams. This sircar furnishes 2000 cavalry, and 5500 infantry.\"\u2014Ranier, which is situated on the opposite side of the Tuptee, is a port dependent on Surat. The followers of Zerdasht (Zoroaster), when they fled from Persia, settled at Surat, where they practise the doctrines inculcated by the Zend, and its commentary the Pazend. From the liberality of its majesty's (Acber) disposition, every sect exercises its particular mode of worship, without suffering the least molestation. Through the negligence of soobahdars and their officers, several ports of this sircar are possessed by the Europeans, among which number are Damaun, Surjaun, Tarapoor, Mahim, and Basseen, all cities and emporiums.\"\nAt present Surat is one of the largest, if not the very largest city of Hindostan, although its trade has unavoidably suffered by the proximity of Bombay, to which place a considerable portion has been transferred. In 1796 one estimate raised the population of Surat so high as 800,000 souls; but another reduced it to 600,000, which probably exceeds the actual number. In 1807 this city contained 1200 parsees of the mobid or sacerdotal class, and about 12,000 of the behdeen, or laity parsees.\n\nLarge ships cannot ascend the river, but cast anchor about 20 miles below the town. The harbour, on the whole, is not commodious; it is, however, one of the best on this coast during the prevalence of the N. E. and N.W. winds. The anchorage is dangerous with winds from the south and west. A large quantity of cotton was formerly exported from Surat direct to China; but much the greater portion is now sent by the way of Bombay. The cotton trade from this part of India to China is of a recent date, and did not commence earlier than 1775, at which era there was a greater number of ships belonging to Surat than there is now to Bombay. The import and export trade which it still retains, is much engrossed by the Arabian and Boras merchants.\n\nAbstract Statement of the Value of external Commerce, imported and exported from Surat, from the 1st May, 1811, to the 30th April, 1812.\n\nRupees.\n\nImports from Bassein, articles of food, soft sugar, cocoa nuts, and sundries 90,307\n\nImports from Brazil Sundries 7,731 Treasure 749,374 757,105\n\nMalabar and Canara, piece goods, sapan wood, and sundries -

After the discovery of the passage to the East by the Cape of Good Hope, it was much frequented by vessels belonging to all European nations, who exported from hence pearls, diamonds, ambergrise, civet, musk, gold, silks, and cottons of every description, spices, fragrant woods, indigo, saltpetre, and all other objects of Indian traffic. From hence also great multitudes of pilgrims embarked for Arabia; on which account Surat was always considered by the Mahomedans of Hindostan as one of the gates of Mecca. In 1612, Captain Best received permission to settle an English factory at Surat, where he left ten persons with a stock of 4000l. to purchase goods. The Dutch did not visit Surat until 1617. The French carried on a considerable but losing trade with Surat during the first years of the 18th century; and having contracted debts to the natives, deserted it altogether. Some time afterwards, in 1714, a company was formed at St. Maloos, which dispatched ships to the East Indies; but these were seized and sequestered at Surat, to liquidate the debts of the former company, with which the St. Malocs association had no concern.\n\nIn January, 1664, the Maharatta army, under Sevajee, made a sudden attack on Surat, when the governor shut himself up in his castle, and the inhabitants fled to the adjoining country. In this emergency Sir George Oxinden, the chief, and the rest of the Company's servants, shut themselves up in the factory with the Company's property, valued at 80,000l. and having fortified it as well as the shortness of the time would allow, called in the ships' crews to assist in its defence. When attacked, they made so brave and vigorous a resistance, that they not only preserved the factory, but the greatest part of the town, from destruction, for which they afterwards received the thanks of the Mogul commander. Surat was attacked, and partially pillaged, by the Maharattas in 1670, and afterwards in 1702. In April, 1707, it was again invested by these freebooters; but, having no cannon, and few fire arms, they were unable to make any progress.\n\nMoyen ud Deen, the ancestor of the present Nabob of Surat, was an adventurer, who, in 1748, possessed himself of the castle of Surat. His successors were Cuttub ud Deen, in 1763; Nizam ud Deen, in 1792; and Nassir ud Deen, in 1800; all invested by the East India Company. The existing system of internal government having been found inadequate to the protection of the persons and property of the inhabitants, on the 13th of May, 1800, a treaty was concluded with Nassir ud Deen, the reigning Nabob of Surat, by which he agreed, that the management of the city and district of Surat, and the administration of civil and criminal justice, should be exclusively vested in the British government. The latter engaged to pay the nabob and his heirs one lack of rupees annually, and also a proportion of one-fifth of the surplus annual revenue, deducting all charges; for satisfaction in which respect, a vakeel on the part of the nabob to have liberty to examine the accounts. The residue of the revenue to be at the disposal of the British government. By the treaty of 1803, the Maharattas were compelled to abandon all their vexations claims on this city. Prior to the entire administration being vested in\nthe British, the surrounding country was much infested by bands of armed thieves, who committed depredations close to the walls, and sometimes even in the streets of Surat.\n\nTravelling distance from Bombay, 177 miles; from Poonah, 213; from Oojain, 309; from Delhi, 756; and from Calcutta, by Nagpoor, 1238 miles.

E.\n\n**Sursuty River, (Saraswati).**\u2014This river has its source in the hills, which bound the north-east extremity of the province of Delhi, from whence it flows in a south-west direction towards the province of Ajmeer, where its stream is lost among the sands of that arid region. Saraswati is also the name of many smaller rivers all over Hindostan.\n\n**Susedoon.**\u2014A town, belonging to native chiefs, in the province of Delhi, situated on the west side of a river of the same name, 108 miles N. W. from the city of Delhi, Lat. 29\u00b0. 13'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 27'. E.\n\n**Susedoon.**\u2014A small town, possessed by independent native chiefs, in the province of Delhi, situated near the ancient canal of Sultan Fe-roze, 60 miles N. W. from the city of Delhi. Lat. 29\u00b0. 20'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 30'. E.\n\n**Sutalury.**\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Backergunge, 108 miles E. from Calcutta. Lat. 22\u00b0. 38'. N. Long. 96\u00b0. 10'. E.\n\n**Sutchana.**\u2014A town in the Gujrat Peninsula, situated to the east of Noanagur, to the Jam of which city it belongs. An extensive fishery is carried on along this part of the Gulf of Cutch, and the dried fish are transported to the interior on camels and bullocks. The pearl oyster is also found here, and is made a source of revenue. (Macnurdo, &c.)\n\n**Sutuleje, (Satadru, with an hundred Bellies, or Channels).**\u2014This river has its source in the lofty Himalaya ridge of mountains, from whence it flows in a southerly direction, bounding the province of Lahore to the east. At Bellaspoor, where it enters Hindostan, the stream is 160 yards broad when the waters are at the lowest. About the middle of its course it is joined by the Beyah, when the united volume takes the name of Kirah; after which they do not mix their waters with the other rivers of the Punjab, but fall into the Indus, about 80 miles below Moultan. The Sutuleje, after its junction with the Beyah, is the Hyphasis of Alexander, and is navigable 200 miles above its conflux with the Indus. The length of its course, including the windings, may be estimated at 600 miles. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"The Sutuleje, formerly called Shetooder, whose source is in the mountains of Ghaflorc. Rooper, Matchwareh, and Ludchauneh, are situated on its banks. After having passed these places, it runs to Bowh Ferry, where it unites with the river Beyah, anciently called Beynasha.\" (Rennel, Abul Fazel, Wilford, &c.)\n\n**Swally, (Sivalaya, the Abode of Siva).**\u2014A town in the province of\nGujrat, situated at the mouth of the Tuptee River, 20 miles W. by S. from Surat.

E.\n\nSylaii.\u2014A large fortified town in the province of Gujrat, district of Chalawara. The south of this town marks the boundary of Cottiar, and here Gujrat Peninsula may be considered as terminating. This place is larger than Wankancer, but not so well fortified. It belongs to a Rajpoot chieftain, but, like all others in this neighbourhood, pays a tribute to the Guicowar. A very large sheet of water covers the south face of the tow. (Macmurd, &c.)\n\nSyrim.\u2014A town in the Birman empire and province of Pegu. Lat. 16\u00b0. 49'. N. Long. 96\u00b0. 17'. E. In the year 1744 the British factory at this place was destroyed by the contending parties, during the wars of the Birmans and Pegners, which were carried on with the most savage ferocity.\n\nT.\n\nTababellah.\u2014A town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Malwah, 32 miles W. from Oojain. Lat. 23\u00b0. 16'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 20'. E.\n\nTablas Isle.\u2014One of the Philippines, situated due south of Luzon, and of a very irregular shape. In length it may be estimated at 30 miles, by three the average breadth.\n\nTacolam.\u2014A town in the Carnatic, 40 miles W. from Madras. Lat. 13\u00b0. 4'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 50'. E.\n\nTagal.\u2014A Dutch establishment on the north coast of Java, where there is a resident to receive the contributions furnished by the chief, and to deposit them in the Company's warehouses. Lat. 6\u00b0. 44'. S. Long. 108\u00b0. 55'. E.\n\nThis is a large village, built at the bottom of a mountain, on which there is a volcano, and inhabited equally by Javanese and Chinese. The mountain is a remarkable object viewed from the sea, having, owing to the eruptions, the appearance of a high tower, with an inclination to one side. (Tombe, &c.)\n\nTagolandia.\u2014A small island, about 20 miles in circumference, situated off the north-eastern extremity of Celebes. Lat. 2\u00b0. 10'. N. Long. 125\u00b0. 5'. E.\n\nThis island is populous, and plentifully supplied with provisions, three chopping knives being the price of a bullock, and one will purchase 1000 cocoa nuts. The Dutch formerly kept a few soldiers here, and a schoolmaster to convert the inhabitants, who are described as pork-eating Pagans, which is a grand distinction among the Malay islands. (Forrest, &c.)\n\nTahej.\u2014A town in the province of Cutch, of which it was the capital when Abul Fazel wrote, A.D. 1582. Lat. 23\u00b0. 17'. N. Long. 70\u00b0. 27'. E.\n\nTahmoor.\u2014A town in the Nabob of Oude's territories, 62 miles N. by E. from Lucknow. Lat. 27\u00b0. 41'. N. Long. 81\u00b0. 10'. E.\n\nTahnesir, (T'haunsar).\u2014An ancient town in the Seik territories, in the province of Delhi, 90 miles N. by W. from the city of Delhi. Lat. 30\u00b0. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 30'. E. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"This was the scene of the war of the Mahabharat. Out of the im-\nmense multitude of forces on the one side, and the troops of Judhiishter on the other, only 12 persons survived the slaughter, of which number four were of the army of Doorjodhen, viz. Keerachari, a Brahmin, who had been preceptor to the Cooroos and Pandos. 2d. Ashotoman, who had exercised the same office. 3d. Keerut Birman, of the Jadown tribe. 4. Sujey, who drove the chariot of Driterashter. The other eight survivors were of the Pandoos army, viz. the five Pandoo brothers: Satick, of the Jadown tribe; Hijtash, who was Doorjodhen's brother by another mother; and Krishna, whose fame is so universal as to render any account of him unnecessary. Near this place stood the ancient city of Hustnapoor.\"\n\nWhen taken by Mahnood of Ghizni in A.D. 1011, Tahmessir was still the capital of a powerful kingdom. At present it is the next town of importance to Pattialah, in the Sirhind district, and is still held in high religious veneration by the Hindoos. The inhabitants of the surrounding country are chiefly Jants, many of whom have become Seiks; and there are also a few Rajpoors of low caste. (Abul Fazel, Sir J. Malcolm, G. Thomas, &c.)\n\nTahnoon.\u2014A district in Northern Hindostan, tributary to the Ghoorkhali Rajah of Nepaul, and forming part of the country of the 24 Rajahs. To the south it is bounded by the British Terriani, belonging to the district of Bettiah in Bahar; but the interior has never been explored. Like the rest of Northern Hindostan it exhibits an irregularly mountainous surface, and it is known to be but thinly inhabited.\n\nTaincum.\u2014A town in Northern Hindostan, belonging to the Ghoorkhali Rajah of Nepaul, situated about 25 miles N.W. from Gorcalh, the ancient capital of the reigning dynasty. Lat. 28\u00b0. 41'. N. Long. 84\u00b0. 10'. E.\n\nTahrah.\u2014A town and fortress in the province of Cutch, situated about 30 miles S.E. from Luckput Bunder, on the road from that place to Mandavee, a sea-port in the Gulf of Cutch.\n\nThe fortress is an irregular building, defended by round towers, flanked by a large tank on each side; the town on the south, and the suburbs on the west. The inhabitants are numerous, and principally Hindoos. The surrounding country is well cultivated, and the soil a heavy sandy loam. (Maxfield, &c.)\n\nTajgauw.\u2014A town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Bejapoor, 17 miles N. by W. from Merritch. Lat. 16\u00b0. 47'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 55'. E. This place was fortified by Pursaram Bhow; and, in 1792, was considered as the capital of his territories, being at that period the residence of his family.\n\nTalnere.\u2014A town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Khandesh, situated on the north bank of the Tuptee River, 92 miles west from Boorhanpoor. Lat. 21\u00b0. 11'. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 55'. E. Abul Fazel describes it as the capital of Adil Shah, the first independent sovereign of Khandesh, A.D. 1406.\n\nTamaracherry.\u2014A small inland town in the province of Malabar, 23 miles N.E. from Calicut. Lat. 11\u00b0. 21'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 3'. E.\n\nFrom the district around this place from two to 300 teak trees may be procured annually, and an equal number of the viti or black wood. Although this be an inland country, and consequently not so favourable for the production of cocoa nut palms, yet trees of that description occupy by far the greater part of the high lands. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nTambah.\u2014A town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Bejapoor, 70 miles south from Poona. Lat. 17\u00b0. 28'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 35'. E.\n\nTambekan.\u2014A small village in Northern Hindostan, belonging to the Ghoorkhali Rajah of Nepaul. Lat. 27\u00b0. 25'. N. Long. 85\u00b0. 30'. E.\n\nThe mines of copper in the vicinity of this place are nearly exhaust-\ned; but other veins have been discovered, and are worked at no great distance from hence. The miners, who are of the Agrye caste, move about from place to place as their discoveries of the metal offer occasion. (Kirkpatrick, &c.)\n\nTamul.\u2014This is the proper national appellation of the Sudras of all the eastern side of the south of India; and the Pracrit Bhasham, or vulgar dialect of the country, is therefore called the language of the Tamuls. It is principally spoken in the tract from the south of Telengana as far as Cape Comorin, and from the Coast of Coromandel to the great range of hills, including the greater part of the Barramahal, Salem, and the country now called Coimbetoor, along which line it is bounded to the west by the province of Malabar. Both language and people are, by those of Karnata, called Arabi and Tigular; and the Tamul Brahmins designated Dravida Brahmins. By Europeans this language is miscalled Malabars. (Willis, F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nTanar.\u2014A town in the province of Gujrat, 41 miles E. by N. from the city of Surat. Lat. 21\u00b0. 21'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 41'. E.\n\nTanakere Isle.\u2014A small island about 12 miles in circumference, surrounded by a cluster of smaller ones, and situated off the S.W. extremity of Celebes. Lat. 5\u00b0. 30'. S.

(Stavorinus, &c.)\n\nTandah, (or Tarrah).\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, adjacent to the ruins of the ancient city of Gour. Lat. 24\u00b0. 49'. N. Long. 88\u00b0. 15'. E.\n\nIn A.D. 1564, Soliman Shah, one of the Bengal sovereigns of the Shere Shah dynasty, made this place his capital, esteeming the situation more healthy than that of Gour. In 1660 Sultan Shujah was defeated near to this by Meer Junla, the general of his brother Aurengzebe. There is little remaining of this place, except the rampart; and, owing to the surrounding swamps, it has never been considered healthy by Europeans. Dimities and cloths, resembling diaper and damask linen, are made in this neighbourhood. (Stewart, Renne, &c.)\n\nTanete.\u2014A town and small principality, situated half way between Fort Rotterdam and the Bay of Soorian. Lat. 4\u00b0. 14'. S. Long. 119\u00b0. 35'. E. In 1775 this petty state was tributary to the Dutch, and governed by a female. (Stavorinus, &c.)\n\nTanjore.\u2014A district in the Southern Carnatic, situated between the 10th and 12th degrees of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by the River Canvery; on the south by the sea; to the east it has also the sea; and on the west Trichinopoly and the polygar's territory.\n\nThis little principality is entitled to the second rank among all the provinces of Hindostan for agriculture and valued rent, the first being assigned to the district of Burdwan in Bengal. For the purposes of irrigation prodigious mounds have been raised at Coilady to prevent the waters of the Cavery from rejoining those of the Coleroon after they have separated near Trichinopoly. From this southern branch of the river canals are conducted in all directions, which, by means of embankments and reservoirs, are diverted into every field, and fertilize a tract of country from Devicotta to Point Calymere, which would otherwise remain a barren sand. The inhabitants of this district are uncommonly industrious and expert in husbandry; there is consequently but a very small proportion of waste land compared with what is seen in some of the neighbouring territories. The dry and wet cultivation are nearly equal, being about 50 per cent. each.\n\nFrom a report on the affairs of Tanjore, in 1807, it appears the province then consisted of 5873 townships. Of this number there are 1807 townships, in which one indi-\nvidual holds the whole undivided lands; 2292 of which the property is held by several persons having their distinct and separate estates; and 1774 the landed property, in which is held in common by all the Meerassdars, or proprietors of the village, who contribute labour and receive a share of the crop in the proportion of their respective properties. The same report states, that the number of Meerassdars, who are Brahmins, are 17,149\n\nOf Sudras, including native Christians - - - - 42,442 Mahommedans - - - - 1,457\n\nTotal 62,048\n\nThe Mahommedans here stated are all Lubbies, descended from individuals of that faith, who emigrated from Arabia in the early part of the eighth century, during the tyrannical reign of Hijaj ben Yusef.\n\nThe principal articles exported from the ports of this district to Madras, are indigo, cocoa nuts, rice, grain, paddy, lamp oil, with some piece goods. The remaining articles, from their description, appear to have been first received from the eastward, Ceylon, or the Malabar Coast, and afterwards sent to Madras. These consist of betel nut, tin, pepper, tortoise shell, benjumin, arrack, Trincomalee wood, and hing. The imports into this province from Madras are small in quantity and value, and are composed chiefly of articles for the European troops and residents, with some iron hoops, camphor, raw silk, silk piece goods, anchors, iron of various sorts, gunnies, planks, and long pepper roots. The sea ports of most commerce are Tranquebar, Nagore, Negapatam, Carical, and Devicotta.\n\nThe Mahommedans having never actually occupied this territory, or effected any permanent establishments in it, the Hindoo religion has been preserved in considerable splendour, and their ancient places of worship, with their vast endowments, remain untouched. In almost every village there is a pagoda with a lofty gateway of massive, but not elegant architecture, where a great number of Brahmins are maintained, either by the revenues formerly attached to them, or by an allowance from government. On all the great roads leading to these sacred places are choultries, built for the accommodation of pilgrims. The Brahmins are here the chief holders of land, and perform almost every office of husbandry, except holding the plough. They are all extremely loyal to the British for the protection they receive, and also for an allowance granted by the government of 45,000 pagodas annually, which is distributed for the support of the poorer temples.\n\nIn the remote times of Hindoo antiquity, Tanjore was distinguished geographically by the name of Chola Desa, from whence originated by several corruptions the word Coromandel, and in native manuscripts its sovereign is still designated the Chola Rajah. The present race are descended from Eccojee, a Maharatta chief, (the brother of Sevaje), who, in A.D. 1675, conquered the city and province, which have been retained by the same dynasty ever since; the Maharatta being the proper language of the Tanjore court. The expedition of the British troops into Tanjore, in 1749, was the first warfare in which they were engaged against the forces of a native prince; and it proved unsuccessful as to its main object, the restoration of a deposed Rajah of Tanjore, who had applied for assistance to the governor of Fort St. David.\n\nSersajee, the present rajah, is the adopted son of Tulijace, who died in A.D. 1786. He was carefully educated under a most respectable Danish missionary, Mr. Schwarts, and among Christians, yet he continued a staunch adherent to the Brahminical doctrines and superstitions. In every other respect he is a man of liberal sentiments, and par-\nparticularly indulgent to the Danish missionaries who live in his country, whose conduct does honour to the Christian name. While yet an independent prince he protected their schools, which were fostered by his old tutor, Mr. Schwarts; and extended his kindness to the Roman Catholics also, who, in 1785, were estimated at 10,000 persons. Even the Brahmins in this province appear to have relaxed a little, as they have procured a printing press, which they dedicate to the glory of their gods.\n\nIn 1799 a commutation of subsidy was effected, and the territory of Tanjore subjected to the British authority. On this event the rajah reserved to himself several palaces, the Tranquebar tribute of 2000 chukrums, a clear allowance of one lack of rupees annually, and one-fifth of the surplus revenues after payment of the civil and military disbursements, which amounts to nearly twice as much more. As a particular favour he was allowed to retain the two forts of Tanjore, which he keeps in excellent repair, and garrisoned with 1500 men. The province now forms one of the districts under the Madras Presidency, and the arrangement has proved equally advantageous to the inhabitants and to the British. (Lord Valentia, Wilks, Parliamentary Reports, Rennel, J. Grant, Fra Paolo, &c. &c.)\n\nTanjore.\u2014A city in the Southern Carnatic, the capital of a district of the same name. Lat. 10\u00b0. 45'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 12'. E.\n\nThis city comprehends two fortresses, both of which are given up to the rajah; but on the exigence of war, the British have a right by treaty to re-occupy them. The small fort is a mile in circumference, very strong, and in good repair. The walls are lofty, and built of large stones, and on the corners of the ramparts are cavaliers. The ditch, which is broad and deep, is cut out of the solid rock, and has a well formed glacis. It joins on one side to the large fort where the rajah resides, which is fortified in a similar manner.\n\nThe small fort contains the celebrated pagoda, the chief building of which is the finest specimen of the pyramidical temple in Hindostan. Within is a bull carved from a block of black granite, an excellent example of Hindoo sculpture. From one of the cavaliers there is a beautiful view. The pagoda forms the foreground, then appears the large fort with the rajah's palace and temples, behind which a rich country is seen covered with rice fields and clumps of trees, and beyond all a chain of lofty mountains. The River Cavery here is at the highest when the periodical rains prevail in Mysore.\n\nIn remote ages this was the great seat of learning in the South of India, and here the almanacs were formed, according to which the year 1800 of the Christian era corresponds with the year 1722 of Saliyabhanum, and the 4901 of the Cali Yug; which reckoning differs one year in the former era, and seven in the latter from that used in Karnata. The British were repulsed from before Tanjore in A.D. 1749, and it was besieged without success by M. Lally in 1758.\n\nTravelling distance from Madras, 205 miles; from Seringapatam, 237; and from Calcutta, 1235 miles. (Lord Valentia, F.

E.\n\nThe Bay of Tapanooly, with the Island of Mansalar, forms one of the finest ports in the world; composed of such a complication of harbours within each other, that it is asserted a large ship might lie so hid among them, as not to be discovered without a laborious research. This inlet stretches into the heart of the Batas country, with whom a considerable traffic is carried on, and timber for masts and spars is to be procured in the various creeks; but not being in the general tract for British vessels, this harbour has been little frequented for naval purposes.\n\nThe large kima cockle (chama gigas) abounds in this bay, one of which that was carried to England measured three feet three inches in its longest diameter, and two feet one inch across. The substance of the shell is, in general, perfectly white, and several inches thick. The roe of this cockle will sometimes weigh six pounds, and the fish altogether, when cleared of the shell, from 20 to 30 pounds. One method of taking them in deep water is by thrusting a bamboo between the valves as they lie open, which is made fast by the immediate closure of the shell. In this bay are also found most beautiful corallines and madreposas.\n\nIn 1760 Tapanooly was taken by a squadron of French ships under the Compte d'Estaing; and, in Oct. 1809, being nearly defenceless, it was again taken by a French squadron, and plundered with every circumstance of atrocity and brutality.

Long. 89\u00b0. 30'. E.\n\nThis town stands in a highly cultivated valley, about three miles in length, by one in breadth; intersected by the Tehintchieu River, the banks of which are lined with willows. On the surrounding mountains are some timber trees, intermixed with fir and pine, and a great variety of flowering shrubs. The\nclimate generally is described as being remarkably salubrious.\n\nThe castle or palace of Tassisu'don is situated near the centre of the valley, and is a building of stone of a quadrangular form. The walls are 30 feet high, and are pierced below with very small windows, apparently more for the purpose of admitting air than light. The citadel is a very lofty building, consisting of seven stories, each from 15 to 20 feet high. From the centre of these rise a square piece of masonry, which supports a canopy of copper richly gilt, supposed to be immediately over the idol Maha Moonee. The Deb Rajah of Bootan dwells in the citadel, on the fourth story from the ground.\n\nNear to this city are a long line of sheds, where the workmen are employed forging brazen gods, and various other ornaments disposed about their religious edifices. There is here also a considerable manufacture of paper, made from the bark of a tree named deah, which grows in great abundance near to Tassisu'don, but is not produced adjacent to Bengal. It is very strong, and capable of being woven, when gilt by way of ornament, into the texture of silks and satins. (Turner, &c.)\n\nTatta, (Tattah).\u2014A district formerly contained in the great soubah of Mooltan, but in modern times transferred to that of Sinde, and its dimensions much circumscribed. To the north it is bounded by Sinde; on the south by the sea; to the east it has Cutch and the Sandy Desert; and on the west the sea and Baloochistan. Its limits at present comprehend merely the Delta of the Indus, which may be estimated at 150 miles in length, by 50 the average breadth. By Abul Fazel, in 1682, it is described as follows:\n\n\"Formerly sircar Tatta was an independent territory, but now it forms part of the empire. The length from Behkur to Cutch and Mekran is 257 coss, and the breadth, from the town of Budeyan to Bunder Lahry, measures 100 coss; and again the breadth from Chander of Behkur to Beykaneer, is 60 coss. On the east lies Gujrat; on the north Beykur and Sewee; on the south the sea, and on the west Cutch (Gundava) and Mekran. Alore is now called Tatta and Debiel. Here the northern mountains form several branches, one of which runs to Candahar. Another branch commences on the sea coast, goes to the town of Koubhar, where it is called Ramgur, and from hence proceeds to Sewistan, where it is called Lucky. Here are a considerable tribe of Baloochees called Kulmauny. They are 20,000 families, and can raise 10,000 choice cavalry. Camels are bred here. Another chain of mountains runs from Sehwau to Sewee, where it is called Khutter. Here dwell a tribe named Nomurdy.\n\n\"In Tatta the winter is so moderate that there is no occasion for furs, and in summer, excepting in Sewistan, the heat is not excessive. The inhabitants travel chiefly by water, and possess not less than 40,000 boats. Here are iron mines and salt pits. Rice is fine and in abundance. At the distance of 12 miles from Tatta is a quarry of yellow stone, which is cut to any size, and used for building. The food of the inhabitants is chiefly fish and rice. They dry fish in the sun, and also extract oil from them, which they use in boat building.\n\n\"Tatta is now (in 1582) the fourth sircar of the soubah of Mooltan. From the northern borders of Tatta to Uteh is a range of mountains of hard black stones, inhabited by various tribes of Baloochees; and on the south from Uteh to Gujrat are sandy mountains, the residence of the Ashambelty and other tribes. The country from Behkoor to Nussepoor and Amerkote is peopled by the Sowrah and Jarreecheh, and other tribes. Sircar Tatta, containing 18 mahals, revenue 25,999,991 dams. Tatta became subject to the Mahommcdans in the year of the Hijera 99 (A.D. 721) during the Caliphat of Walid.\"\nSince Abul Fazel wrote this district has experienced a gradual decay, which has of late years been so much accelerated, that the country is in danger of becoming a barren desert. Although resembling, in many of their geographical features, the Delta of the Indus presents, in other respects, a remarkable contrast to that of the Ganges. From the sea-coast to the city of Tatta scarcely any thing is to be seen but an arid sandy country, covered in different places with the milk bush, and other shrubs peculiar to sterile lands, and almost destitute of fresh water, which must be procured from an immense depth underground. Here and there low ranges of bare scraggy hills are seen, but scarcely a vestige of population or cultivation for many miles from the sea.\n\nBetween Tatta and Corachie are many tombs and ruins, which would indicate a state of former prosperity, very different from its present miserable condition. The wells, and other remains of the ancient city of Bambarah, are still discernible, but now covered with baubool and other wild shrubs, and inhabited only by a few Hindoo devotees. Between Tatta and Corachie there is an inland lake of considerable extent, and navigable for small boats, but the water of it is brackish. During the freshes of the Indus, when at its highest, part of the low country is inundated. As the city of Tatta is approached from the sea, the soil and aspect of the country improve; but still without trees, and almost destitute of inhabitants. Camels are bred in this part of the country, the tender parts of the brushwood serving them for forage.\n\nThe natives of India, from Sinde to Goa, use the word Kanta (a fork) to signify also borders on the seacoast; and know the Delta of the Indus under the appellation of Sindhoo Kanta, which approaches nearly to the term preserved in some Latin maps of Canthi Sindi.\n\nFor about 30 years past this district has been under the government of the Ameers of Sinde, and subjected to every species of extortion and oppression. The city and district of Tatta are said to yield a revenue of 145,000 rupees per annum; the district of Sunkree 80,000; Corachie Bunder, 110,000; and Dharaja, 80,000. The district of Kukrallee is asserted to have produced a revenue of six lacks of rupees during the government of the Calories, which is now reduced to 190,000 rupees. The territory situated between the salt and fresh water branches of the river is said to yield 91,000 rupees per annum. The whole district contains only one town, which is Tatta.\n\nThis country was invaded by the Mahommedans at a very early period after the promulgation of that religion. Caliph Omar dispatched Moghaireh Abul Aas, who, setting off from Bahrain by sea, attacked the western parts of the Delta of the Indus; but, meeting with unexpected resistance, he was defeated, and lost his life. As Omar died in A.D. 641, this expedition must have taken place about 639 or 640. Othman, his successor, attempted an invasion by land; but, having sent people to survey the roads, he was deterred by their report. It does not appear to have been actually subdued by the Emperor Acber until 1590, although long prior to that period included in the list of his dominions. Since the fall of the Mogul dynasty it has followed the fate of Sinde, and still continues subject to the Ameers of that extensive province. (Abul Fazel, Smith, Maxfield, Wilford, Drummond, &c.)\n\nTatta.\u2014A town belonging to the Ameers of Sinde, the capital of a district of the same name, and situated near the banks of the Indus, about 130 miles, by the course of the river, from the sea. Lat. 24\u00b0 44'. N. Long. 68\u00b0 17'. E.\n\nThis town stands in a valley, formed by a range of low rocky hills, which, during the freshes of the In-\ndus, is inundated; but, being placed on an eminence, apparently formed by ancient ruins, during the height of the rains it has the semblance of an island. The streets are very narrow and dirty; but the houses, although irregularly built of mud, chopped straw, and wood, are superior to the low huts commonly seen in native towns. The better sort of houses are built of brick and lime. The old English factory, purchased by the Company in 1751, still remains, and may be reckoned the best house, not only in Tatta, but in the whole province of Sinde. All the rooms of this house have ventilators, resembling the funnels of chimneys, which communicate with the roof; and are intended to promote a circulation of air during the hot winds, when all the windows are shut to exclude the dust. To the southward of the factory within the town are the remains of the old fort, which must have been a strong position against assailants ignorant of artillery tactics. At present there is no fort, nor is there any military force stationed in the town, which is governed by a nabob, or deputy, from the Amirs of Sinde.\n\nTatta was originally defended by a strong brick wall, with round towers; but now these are a heap of ruins, and the mosques and pagodas that remain exhibit symptoms of rapid decay. The circumference of the town is from four to five miles, and the number of inhabitants about 15,000. It was once famous for its commerce and cloth manufactories, besides an extensive trade in rice, wheat, hides, &c. but all this is greatly diminished. The chief exports are ghee, gugal or b'dellium, potash, oil, raisins, saltpetre, aniseed, shai-kun, musk, chintzes, shawls from Shekarpoor, carpets, and a variety of drugs. The imports are cocoa nuts, pepper, cardamoms, betel nut, nutmegs, cinnamon, silk, raw and manufactured, cochineal, broad cloth, bogliopes, kincobs, puppets, quicksilver, tin, iron, steel, copper, lead, black wood, sandal wood, and sandal wood oil.\n\nThe Indus is in general shoal opposite to Tatta; on which account boats trading to that city lie off a small village named Begurah, distant five miles S. E. by S. where the deepest water is four fathoms, but for the most part only two; and the river about one mile in breadth. The strength of the current is here broken by the small Island of Begurah, which is 200 yards from the western bank of the river. The boats used on the Indus are flat bottomed, square head and stern, low forward, high abaft, and drawing only a few inches of water. Oars are seldom used, the boats being usually either tracked, or pushed along with poles; and, when the wind is fair, recourse is had to sails. Their form is broad, and very commodious for the purposes of travelling. From Tatta to Hyderabad there are four routes; two by land and two by water, the shortest of which may be estimated at 53 miles. At this place the monsoon prevails with considerable violence between May and October, attended with hard squalls of thunder, lightning, wind, and rain.\n\nThe country around Tatta is a fine rich soil, watered by canals from the Indus, and partly overflowed during the freshes, but susceptible of the highest cultivation. On the hill of Muckalce, a mile to the west of Tatta, are an amazing number of graves and mausoleums\u2014the habitations of the dead greatly exceeding in number those of the living. The tomb of Mirza Besau is uncommonly magnificent and well executed; and is supposed to have been erected about A.D. 1622. It consists of a large square stone building; two stories high, having a great dome supported by numerous pillars, which, as well as the body of the building, are covered with sentences extracted from the Koran. Some of the inscriptions on the other tombs appear fresh and quite legible, although engraved 160 years ago. On the banks\nof the Indus, seven miles above Tatta, is another hill, covered with white mosques and tombs of deceased Mahomedans, some of the latter of considerable size. Near to one of the smallest, which is held in great veneration both by Mahomedans and Hindoos, is a large bone stuck upright in the earth, about 18 feet long, one thick, and two broad, which the natives assert was procured from a fish. The hill on which these graves are placed, if fortified, would command the passage of the river.\n\nDr. Robertson is of opinion, that Tatta is the Pattala of the ancients; but this name more probably referred to the city of Brahminabad, which appears to have been the capital in the remote ages of Hindoo antiquity. By Abul Fazel it is described as follows:\n\n\"The ancient capital was Brahminabad, which was then a very populous city. The fort had 1400 bastions, a tenab distant from each other; and to this day there are considerable vestiges of this fortification.\"\n\nThe modern city of Tatta is said to have been founded by Jam Mundel, the 14th of the Someah dynasty, A.D. 1485. It was taken and plundered by the Portuguese in 1555; but continued in the 17th century an extensive and populous city, of great commerce, and possessing manufactures of silk, Caramania wool, and cotton; it was also famous for its cabinet ware. Most of the Sindean cloths exported to Hindostan, Persia, and Khorasan, are still manufactured here, the miserable remains of its once flourishing commerce, which is not likely to revive under its present barbarous and rapacious rulers.\n\nTravelling distance from Bombay, 741 miles; from Calcutta, 1602 miles.

In Nepaul it is named the Yo Sanpoo; and, like other eastern streams, has different names at different parts of its course.\n\nTEETGAUM.\u2014A town in the district of Neyer, situated about 12 miles S. W. from Theraud. This place has a very large tank, with several wells; and the appearance of the town is superior to most others in this miserable district. To the south there is little or no cultivation, and much jungle. Teetgaum acknowledges the authority of the Therand chief; but, being occupied by Rajpoot zemindars, pays him little revenue.\n\nTEHINCHIEN RIVER.\u2014A river of Bootan, which runs past Tassisudon, the capital; and, being swelled by the united streams of the Hatchien, and by the Patchicu, which takes its course near Paro, finds a passage through the mountains, from whence it is precipitated in tremendous cataracts; and, rushing with rapidity between the high cliffs and vast stones that oppose its progress, descends into a valley, a few miles east from Buxedwar, and finally joins the Brahmapootra. (Turner, &c.)\n\nTELINGANA.\u2014In the Institutes of Acber this region is named Berar, but was only in part possessed by that sovereign. Telunga is at once the name of a nation, of its language, and of the character in which it is written. The Telunga language, formerly called the Kalinga, occupied the space to the eastward of the Maharatta, from near Cieacole its northern, to within a few miles of Pullicut its southern boundary, with the intervention of a stripe of territory where the Geand tongue was used. This tract was divided into the Andray and Kalinga countries, the former to the south, and the latter to the north of the Godavery. At the period of the Mahommedan conquest the greater part of these united provinces seems to have been known to that people by the general name of Telingana, and Worangole as the capital of the whole. The Telingas form a distinct race, and still occupy a considerable portion of the Deccan. By the English and other Europeans they were formerly designated Gentoos, a name unknown to any Indian dialect. (Wilks, Colebrooke, Rennel, &c.)\n\nTELICHERRY, (Tuli Chari).\u2014A town on the sea coast of the Malabar Province, 126 miles travelling distance from Seringapatam. Lat. 11\u00b0. 44'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 36'. E.\n\nThis place was long the chief settlement of the English on the coast of Malabar; but, in 1800, the East India Company's commerce having been transferred to Mahe, it has de-\nclined considerably. The richest natives still reside here, and the inhabitants are far more civilized than in the other parts of the province. The grounds within the old English lines are highly cultivated, and the thriving state of the plantations on the sandy land near the sea shews that the whole is capable of improvement. This town is the mart for the best sandal wood brought from above the Western Ghauts, and the cardamoms Wynaad, which are mostly exported from hence, are mostly reckoned the best on the coast.\n\nIn the year 1800 Tellichery, Mahe, and Darmapatan, formed a circle, containing 4481 houses, occupied as follows: \u2014 By Portuguese, 438; by Mahomedans, 868; Namburies (Brahmins), 9; Puttar, Brahmins, 16; Rajahs, 2; Nairs, 276; Tiars, 1888; Mucuas, 258; natives of Carnata, 119; male slaves, 91; and female slaves, 70.\n\nIn A.D. 1683 the presidency of Surat established a factory here for the purchase of pepper and cardamons; and in 1708 the East India Company obtained a grant of the fort of Tellicherry from the colastry, or clerical rajah. During the reign of Tippoo, in consequence of his hostile policy, this settlement was supported at so great an expense, and partook so little of the commerce of the country, that the Bombay government had it in contemplation to recommend its being relinquished, as an unnecessary and unprofitable factory. (F. Buchanan, Diron, Duncan, &c.)\n\nTello.\u2014A town in Celebes, and formerly the capital of an independent principality. Lat. 5\u00b0. 5' S. Long. 119\u00b0. 30' E.\n\nIn 1667 the state of Tello was bounded on the north by the Coerces, two islands situated to the south of the River Maros, and to the south it reached as far as Port Rotterdam. The princes of Goak and Tello are both called Kings of Macassar, although each is a separate state, deriving their names from their capitals; but both principalities have long been under the power of the Dutch.\n\nThe ninth king of Tello, Abd al Kurecm, died in 1708, and was succeeded by his son, Mappa Orangei, who was elected King of Goak in 1712, and ruled over both states until 1724, when he gave up that of Tello to his son Man Rajah, or Rajah Mooda. To him succeeded Crain Tello, who, in 1759, was a most inveterate enemy to the Dutch. The queen who reigned in 1775 was his daughter. (Stavorinus and Notes, &c., &c.)\n\nTenasserim, (Tanergsari). \u2014 A district in the Burman empire, extending along the sea coast from the 11th to the 14th degrees of north latitude. The west coast of this territory is protected from the southwest monsoon, by a connected barrier of islands, extending 135 miles from north to south, with a strait between them and the main land, from 15 to 30 miles broad. The language of the inhabitants of this district, denominated Tinaw by the Siamese, differs considerably from the common Burman, and has many peculiarities.\n\nThe natives of this province are named by the Burmans Dawayza and Bycitza, from the two governments of which their country consists. They have most frequently been subject to Siam and Pegu; but at present they are under the sway of the Burmans. (Forrest, Leyden, F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nTenasserim.\u2014A town in the Burman empire, the capital of a province of the same name. Lat. 11\u00b0. 42' N. Long. 98\u00b0. 50' E.\n\nIn 1688 the Court of Directors of the East India Company ordered their servants at Madras to endeavour to obtain possession of this place from the King of Siam, and afterwards to fortify it. In 1759 it was taken from the Siamese by Alompra, the Burman monarch, after a feeble resistance. It was then\nlarge and populous, but is now almost a heap of ruins. (Symes, Bruce, &c.)\n\n**Ternate Isle.**\u2014One of the small Moluccas, about 25 miles in circumference, situated on the west coast of Gilolo. Lat. 50\u00b0 N. Long. 127\u00b0 20' E.\n\nWhile under the Dutch government the province of Ternate included the islands of Tidore, Motir, Machian, and Batchian, which are properly the Moluccas, being the original places of growth of the finer spices. Larger nutmegs are still found in the woods of Ternate than any produced at Banda. Although all the efficient authority has long been possessed by the officers of the Dutch establishment, a native sovereign, the Sultan of Ternate, has continued to exercise certain functions of sovereignty over the natives of the island, and of some of the adjacent isles. In 1774 his dominions comprehended the greatest part of the north of Gilolo, and also a great part of the north-east quarter of C\u00e9lebes, where are the Dutch settlements of Manado and Goruntola. Sangir also belonged to him and the neighbouring islands of Siao, Karakita, Tagulanda, Banika, and Tellusani.\n\nOn this island there are three mosques for the Mahomedans, and one church for the Dutch, but none for the Portuguese, who are become as black as the natives. The country is divided into five districts, over which there are five syngees, or chiefs; and also a captain laut, or high admirat, who commands the sultan's prows. Besides, there is a gogo, an officer who superintends the police. The Dutch settlers reside at Port Orange, and consist of a governor and council, a shalbunder, and fiscal. In 1777 the Dutch establishment, civil and military, comprehended 847 persons, and by them trade was in a great measure monopolized; the Chinese, however, always enjoyed considerable privileges. No Chinese junk was allowed to come to Ternate direct from China; but they were permitted to resort to Macassar, which may be considered as the western frontier of the Moluccas. On this island there is a lofty peak, which sometimes discharges flames.\n\nThe first Mahomedan sovereign of Ternate is said to have reigned from A.D. 1466 to 1486. In 1521 it was visited by the Portuguese, who took formal possession; but they were expelled in 1530. In 1579 it was touched at by Sir Francis Drake, who, according to the fashion of the day, took possession of it in the name of Queen Elizabeth. Along with the kingdom of Portugal it devolved to the Spaniards, who lost Ternate in 1806; but retained a footing in the Moluccas so late as 1663, when they abandoned their settlement at Gammalama. In 1680 the Dutch compelled the Sultan of Ternate to become tributary to them, and the princes of the other Moluccas were so thoroughly subdued, that in the year 1778 the kings of Tidore and Batchian were deposed, and exiled to Batavia. With the Dutch it remained until the revolutionary war, when it was twice captured by the British; the last time on the 28th August, 1810. (Stavorinus and Notes, Forrest, &c., &c.)\n\n**Terriani, (Turyani).**\u2014A district situated about the 27th degree of north latitude, partly comprehended in the British dominions, and partly in those of Nepaul. To the south it is bounded by Goracpoor, Bettiah, and Tyrhoot.\n\nThe Turyani of Nepaul, confined between the Gunduck and the Teesta, is divided into five sotibahs, or governments, viz. Subtuni, Moh-tuni, Rohut, Bharach, and Persa. Extensive as this territory is, the Rajah of Nepaul does not draw any considerable revenue from it, owing to mismanagement and the low state of its population. West Turrye remits only two lacks of rupees to Catmandoo, and East Turrye, al-\nthough it is more fertile, only a lack and a half.\n\nThe Western Turryc contains inexhaustible forests of most excellent timber. The pines of Bechacori, and the sal trees both of that and of the Jhurjoory forest, are not surpassed anywhere for straightness or durability, and might be floated south on the Boora Gunduck. Kota, or pure turpentine of the Sulla pine, might also be procured. The word Turyani properly signifies marshy land, and is sometimes applied to the flats lying below the hills in the interior of Nepaul, as well as to the low tract bordering on the Company's northern frontier. Hetowra, although standing very little below the Cheriaghati top, is nevertheless comprehended in the Turrye, or Turyani of Nepaul, as indeed is the whole country situated to the south of Chesapany.\n\nThe principal rivers of this district are the Bhagmutty, the Bukkia, and the Jumne, besides many nullahs and inferior streams. Thin as is the population, it is rather surprising, considering its vicinity to the Company's dominions, that this dreary tract should have any inhabitants at all. (Kirkpatrick, &c.)\n\nTerrowen.\u2014A town and fortress in the province of Allahabad, district of Bundelcund, which was taken and plundered by Gopaul Singh in 1810.\n\nTervengary, (Terranavana Angady).\u2014A small Moplay (Mahomedan) town in the province of Malabar, 23 miles S. by E. from Calicut. Lat. 11\u00b0. 2'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. E. This place is situated on the banks of a river which comes from Irnada, and in the rainy season is navigable 32 miles above for canoes. Near to this, in 1729, a decisive victory was gained by Colonel Hartley's army over Tippoo's forces.\n\nTeshoo Loomboo, (or Skiggatzee Jeung).\u2014The seat of the Teshoo Lama, and the capital of all that part of Tibet immediately subject to his authority. Lat. 29\u00b0. 4'. N. Long. 89\u00b0. 7'. F.\n\nTeshoo Loomboo, or Lubrong, is properly a large monastery, consisting of three or 400 houses, the habitations of the gyalongs, besides temples, mausoleums, and the palace of the sovereign pontiff. Its buildings are all of stone, none less than two stories high, flat roofed, and crowned with a parapet rising considerably above the roof, composed of heath and brushwood. The fortress of Shiggatzee Jeung stands on a prominent ridge of rock, and commands the pass. From hence are roads to Bootan and Bengal, to Labdack and Cashmere; to the mines of lead, copper, cinnabar, and gold; by Tingri Meidaun to Nepaul; to Lassa and China. The distance from hence to Catmandoo, the capital of Nepaul, by the marching road, is estimated at 400 miles. In 1780 the journey of the deceased lamas attendants, from Pekin to Teshoo Loomboo, occupied seven months and eight days. On the north is situated the territory of Taranath Lama, bordering upon Russia and Siberia, and whose influence more especially extends over the Kilmauks, or hordes of Calmuc Tartars.\n\nThe plain of Teshoo Loomboo, which is perfectly level, is encompassed on all sides by rocky hills. Its direction is north and south, and its extreme length 15 miles; its southern extremity in breadth, from east to west, is about five or six miles. The River Painomchicka intersects it, and at a small distance joins the Brahmapootha. The hills are of a rocky nature, of the colour of rusty iron, and are easily shivered by the effect of the weather into little cubical pieces, small enough to be moved about by the force of strong winds.\n\nThe rock of Teshoo Loomboo is by far the loftiest of all that are in its neighbourhood. From the summit the eye commands a very extensive prospect, but no striking traces of population are to be discovered, the natives crowding into the hollow re-\ncesses. From the north side the celebrated River Brahmapootra, stiled in the language of Tibet Erechoomboo, is visible. It here flows in a widely-extended bed through many channels, forming a multitude of islands. Its principal channel is described as being narrow, deep, and never fordable.\n\nIn 1783 there were reckoned on the establishment of the monastery at Teshoo Loomboo, no less than 3700 gylongs for the performance of daily prayer in the goomba, or temple. Four lamas, chosen from among them, superintend and direct their religious ceremonies. Their stated periods of devotions are the rising of the sun, noon, and sunset. Youth intended for the service of the monastery are received into it at the age of eight or 10 years. On admission they are enjoined sobriety, forego the society of women, and confine themselves to the austere practices of the cloister. There are also a considerable number of nunneries, the regulations of which are equally strict.\n\nAt this place there is an extensive establishment under the direction of the monastery, for the manufacture of images, in which they excel the Chinese. The annual consumption of tea in the territory of Teshoo Loomboo amounts to the value of 70,000 pounds. At the capital 300 Hindoos, Gosains, and Sunyasses, are daily fed by the bounty of the lama. The whole system exhibits a hierarchy of long duration, and attended with considerable practical benefit. The gylongs, or monks, having devoted themselves to the duties of religion, obtain a large portion of respect from their countrymen, who follow worldly avocations. Being attached by a common bond of union, the one portion to labour, and the other to pray, they enjoy in peace and harmony the bounties of nature; and find it unnecessary to employ a single man in arms, either to defend their territory, or maintain their rights. (Turner, Kirkpatrick, &c.)\n\nTheraud, (or Turrah).\u2014A town in the province of Gujrat, situated about half way between Rahdunpoor and Theraud. Lat. 24\u00b0. 20'. N. Long. 71\u00b0. 57'. E.\n\nThis is an open town, containing about 2500 houses, 1500 of which are the property of Coolces; the other inhabitants being Rajpoots, Koonbees, Banyans, &c. To the north of Theralli, which may be considered as the present capital of the Kakreze, the country is cultivated, but interspersed with bushy jungle, and very deficient in water, which is procured from wells 40 yards deep, some of which are brackish. The present chiefs of Therah are Tezabhoy and Jalim Singh, who divide between them a revenue from 10 villages, amounting to about 35,000 rupees per annum. (Macnurdo, &c.)\n\nTheraud.\u2014A town and district on the N.W. frontier of the province of Gujrat. Lat. 24\u00b0. 37'. N. Long. 71\u00b0. 58'. E.\n\nThe pargannah of Theraud is bounded on the north by Marwar, Sanjore being 30 miles N. N. E. from the town. On the west it is bounded closely by Wow, which is only distant 12 miles. To the south it has Babere, 30 miles distant; and on the east the district of Deesa, in which direction its territory extends 40 miles. Within these boundaries it is said to contain 33 villages, yielding a revenue to Hirbumjee, the chief, of 20,000, while his expenses exceed 60,000 rupees, the difference being made up by plundering his neighbours. In this whole district there is not a river, and few of the villages are supplied with a tank. At Theraud water is found about 60 yards below the surface, but it is not always of a good quality, and the wells, from which the villages are supplied, are frequently brackish. The scarcity of water entirely prevents the cultivation of vegetables, of which, with the exception of onions brought from Rahdunpoor, Theraud is destitute.\n\nThe inhabitants of the country\nsubsist chiefly on bajeree, all classes being too poor to purchase wheat. Their other articles of food are the milk of cows and camels, and the flesh of goats and sheep. The Therand district furnishes excellent camels and good horses; many of the latter are also imported from Bhau-dra, situated to the westward, where the breed is still superior. The cultivators are tolerably well treated by their chiefs, who are restrained from extreme oppression by the threat of deserting and retiring to an adjacent village, probably the domain of an enemy or rival. The government share of the produce is one-fourth. Money is scarcely ever seen.\n\nThe town of Therand contains about 2700 houses, 300 of which are inhabited by Banyans; the remainder by Coolees, Rajpoots, and Sin-deans. It is surrounded by a wall and ditch, the latter about 30 feet deep, but both in a very bad state of repair. By the natives of the surrounding country it is esteemed a place of great strength, and it is so against predatory troops, in a country without artillery. With the exception of the court house and the Parishath temples, it contains few good buildings. Most of the wells are brackish, and the surrounding jungle comes close up to the walls.\n\nThis place is situated so near to the borders of Sinde, that constant inroads are made by parties of marauding cavalry, from the tract betwixt Therand and the Indus. The Therand chief can muster 1300 cavalry well mounted, 300 of whom are his family horsemen, or troops related to him by marriage or caste, and who reside in the durbar, or court house. The others are Sin-deans, and are a species of local militia. Both town and pergunnah have long been tributary to the Joud-poor Rajah, who is always obliged to send a very large force when he wishes to levy the tribute. (Mac-murdo, &c.)\n\nTherwara.\u2014A town in the province of Gujrat, situated about 30 miles N. W. from Rahdunpoor. This place belongs nominally to Kumaul Khan, a Baloochee chief, but is a den of Coolee thieves, who neither pay tribute, nor acknowledge the Khan's authority.\n\nThagur.\u2014A town in the Carnatic, 56 miles W. by S. from Pondicherry. Lat. 11\u00b0. 45'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 12'. E.\n\nDuring the Carnatic wars of the last century this was a place of considerable strength, and sustained several sieges. It then consisted of two fortifications on a high mountain, one above, but communicating with the other; and a pettah on a plain to the eastward, with a mud wall, and surrounded at a small distance by an impenetrable bound hedge. After the capture of Pondicherry, in 1761, this important fortress surrendered to a detachment under Major Preston, having been blockaded and bombarded 65 days. (Orme, &c.)\n\nTIBET, (Tibbet).\n\nThis vast region may be considered as comprehending all the space from the sources of the Indus to the borders of China, and from Hindostan to the great desert of Cobi. Its length from east to west may be estimated at 1600 miles, its breadth is great but unequal. The country of Tibet is called by the inhabitants Pne, or Puckoachim; a term which is said to be derived from Pne, northern, and Koachim, snow; or the snowy land to the north. It is also known both here and in Bengal by the name of Tibbet, pronounced with a double b. In Nepaul, Lower Tibet is frequently distinguished by the appellation of Kutchar, and in Hindostan by that of Potyid.\n\nThis is a territory of great altitude, being part of that elevated tract which gives rise not only to the great rivers of India and China, but also to those of Siberia and Tartary. The Moonang Mountains, part of the great Himalaya chain, about the\n28th degree of north latitude, mark the boundary of Tibet and Bootan; and the summit of Chumularee, probably, constitutes the highest land in what is called Little Tibet. The rivers from hence run north, and fall into the Brahmapootra at a short distance beyond Tesiho Loemboo.\n\nIn the temperature of the seasons a remarkable uniformity prevails in Tibet, both in their periodical duration and return. The same division of them takes place as in Bengal. The spring is from March to May, with a variable atmosphere, and heat, thunder storms, and occasional showers. From June to September, is the season of humidity, when heavy and continued rains swell the rivers. From October to March a clear and uniform sky succeeds, seldom obscured either by fogs or clouds. For three months of this season a degree of cold is felt far greater probably than is experienced in Europe. Its extreme severity is more particularly confined to the southern boundary of Tibet, near the elevated range of mountains which separate it from Nepaul, Bootan, and Assam. The summits of these are covered at all seasons of the year with snow, and their vicinity is remarkable at all times for the dryness of the winds. Here meat and fish are preserved during winter in a frozen state. At Tueno, in Tibet, on the 16th Sept. 1783, at six in the morning, the thermometer stood below the freezing point. The dryness of the atmosphere also in Tibet is very remarkable, and operates an effect similar to that of the scorching winds that prevail over the arid soil of Hindostan. Vegetation is frequently dried to brittleness, and every plant may be rubbed between the fingers into dust.\n\nWhen first viewed Tibet strikes the traveller as one of the least favoured countries under heaven, and appears, in a great measure, incapable of cultivation, exhibiting only low rocky hills, without any visible vegetation, or extensive barren plains. On account of the severity of the climate, the inhabitants are obliged to seek for shelter in the valleys and hollows. From Phari to Nainee, in Tibet, a distance of nearly 50 miles, the country is very little removed in aspect, population, or culture, from a perfect desert. The hills are bare, and composed of a stiff, dry, moulting rock, which splits and shivers with the frost.*\n\nOn account of the high winds, sandy soil, and glare from the reflection of the sun from the snow and ground, the natives are much subject to blindness and sore eyes.\n\nThe soil of Tibet is for the greater part unimprovable by cultivation, but under ground it abounds with minerals, and in this elevated region the production of nitre is abundant and spontaneous. It is the practice of the cultivators in Tibet, to flood the low lands on the approach of winter with water, which freezes and covers their surface with a sheet of ice, and thus prevents their being stripped of their scanty soil by violent winds. The usual crops are wheat, peas, and barley; rice being the production of a more southern soil. In some parts they pluck up the corn by the root, and afterwards place it in small bundles to dry.\n\nIn Tibet a great superabundance of animal life is found, which is scarce in Bootan. The variety and quantity of wild fowl, game, beasts of prey, flock, droves, and herds, are astonishing. In Bootan, on the contrary, except domesticated quadrupeds, there are no others, and almost no game besides pheasants.\n\nAmong the most remarkable animals of this country is the Yak of Tartary, named also the Soora Goy, or bushy tailed bull of Tibet. In size they resemble the English cattle, and are covered all over with a thick coat of long hair. The tail is composed of a prodigious quantity of long, flowing, glossy hair. There is a great variety of colour among them, but white and black are the most prevalent. Although not large\nboned, from the profuse quantity of hair about them, they seem to be of great bulk. These cattle are pastured in the coldest parts of Tibet, upon the short herbage peculiar to the tops of mountains and bleak plains. The lofty chain of mountains which divides Tibet from Bootan are their favourite haunts. They are never employed in agriculture, but are useful as beasts of burthen. From their hair tents and ropes are manufactured. Their tails are in great repute throughout Hindostan as chowries, which are in universal use for driving away flies and mosquitoes; they are, likewise, employed as ornamental furniture upon horses and elephants. They furnish an abundant quantity of rich milk, from which excellent butter is procured. When uneasy they make a low grunting noise.\n\nAnother native of Tibet is the musk deer, which is observed to delight in intense cold. This animal is about the height of a moderate sized hog, which it resembles in the figure of the body. It has a small head, a thick and round hind quarter, no scent, and extremely delicate limbs. From the upper jaw two long curved tusks proceed, directed downwards. It is covered with a prodigious quantity of hair, between two and three inches long, which grows erect over the body, and seems to partake more of the nature of feathers, or porcupine's quills. The musk is a secretion formed in a little bag or tumour, resembling a wen, situated at the navel, and is only found in the male. This animal is here reckoned the property of the state, and can only be hunted by permission of the government.\n\nA third peculiar production of Tibet is the celebrated shawl goat. These creatures are of various colours, black, white, a faint bluish tinge, and of a shade somewhat lighter than a fawn. They have straight horns, and are of a lower stature than the smallest sheep in England. The material used for the manufacture of shawls is of a light fine texture, and grows next the skin. A coarse covering of long hair grows above this, and preserves the softness of the inferior coat. After repeated trials it has been found impossible to rear this species of goat in any other country.\n\nIn Tibet goods are carried by the chowry tailed cattle, horses, mules, and asses; the customs differing, in this respect, from those of Bootan, where they are carried by the inhabitants, and mostly by women. The horses are principally geldings, brought from Eastern Tartary, and are seldom above 14 hands high. The sheep of Tibet are also occasionally used as beasts of burthen. Numerous flocks are here seen in motion laden with grain and salt, each carrying from 12 to 20 pounds. The skins of lambs are cured with the wool on, and constitute a valuable article of traffic. In order to obtain the skin in the highest degree of excellence, the dam is sometimes killed before her time of weaning, which secures a silky softness to the fleece. It serves particularly for lining vests, and is in high estimation all over Tartary and China. These sheep appear a peculiar species indigenous to the climate, with black heads and legs.\n\nGold is the principal article of export from Tibet; those next in importance are musk, tineal, goats' hair, and rock salt. The tineal is found in the bed of a lake, about 15 days' journey from Teshoo Loomboo. The hair of the goats is carried to Cashmere, and is of that superior sort from which shawls are manufactured. The salt is exported to Nepaul and Bootan, and there are also mines of lead and copper. A very small quantity of specie is current in Tibet, and that of a base standard, being the silver coin of Nepaul, here termed indernillee.\n\nThe commerce between Tibet and China is carried on, for the most part, at a garrison town, on the western frontier of China, named\nSilling, or Sinning. The exports to China are gold dust, precious stones, musk, and woollen cloths. The imports are gold and silver brocades, silks, teas, tobacco, quicksilver, China ware, furs, and some silver bullion. To Bengal the exports are gold dust, musk, tincal; the imports from thence are broad cloth, triquets, spices, particularly cloves, pearls, coral, amber, kinebobs, Maulda cloths, Ringpoor leather, tobacco, and indigo. With Assam there is no intercourse. It is said that British woollens, both fine and ordinary, are bought up in Tibet with great eagerness, when carried there by travelling merchants. The cold in Tibet is so extreme, that the inhabitants, for want of woollens of a proper kind, are obliged to encumber themselves with a heavy load of their own sort of clothing.\n\nGold is found in Tibet in very large quantities, and often uncommonly pure. In the form of gold dust it is procured in the beds of rivers, attached to small pieces of stone, and sometimes it is found in large masses, lumps, and irregular veins. Cinnabar, containing a large portion of quicksilver, is a production of Tibet, and might be advantageously extracted by distillation, if fuel were more plentiful; but it is remarkably scarce, the only substitute for firewood being the dried dung of animals. Thus situated, in so rigid a climate, the most valuable discovery for the inhabitants of Tibet would be that of a coal mine. In some parts of China, bordering on this country, coal is found, and used as fuel. Both in Tibet and Bootan, the first member of the state is the chief merchant; he is, consequently, invested with privileges above the common adventurer, who cannot enter into a competition with him.\n\nThe natives of Tibet are accustomed to very warm clothing, the dress of the lower classes in summer being woollens of an inferior kind; and in winter sheep or foxes' skins cured with the wool and fur on. The highest classes use silks and furs. The Tibetans, always travelling on level ground, carry a weight of clothing that bid defiance to the most piercing winds; besides which, they wear very thick boots. The great men of Tibet, as well as in Bootan, are peculiarly accustomed to travel in the dark. The houses of the peasantry are of a mean construction, and resemble brick kilns. They are built of rough stones, heaped on each other, with three or four apertures to admit light. The roof is a flat terrace, surrounded with a parapet wall two or three feet high. In their repasts, the Tibetans give a uniform preference to undressed crude meat. Of this description mutton is almost their only food; and at their feasts the table is seen spread with raw joints of fresh mutton, as well as boiled; the first being the most esteemed. The Tibetans generally are a very kind and humane people.\n\nThe smallpox is a disorder as much dreaded among them as the plague is in other parts of Asia. When it is known to exist in a village, the healthy hasten to desert it, and leave the infected to chance, and the natural course of the distemper. The use of mercury for the venereal disease appears to have been early introduced, and is administered with tolerable skill. The great scarcity of timber in Tibet not permitting them to have boarded floors, they are much troubled with cramps and rheumatic pains.\n\nA white scarf is an offering invariably attendant on every intercourse of ceremony, both in Tibet and Bootan. A similar piece of silk is always transmitted under cover with the letters, which in England would be an expensive operation. This manufacture is of a thin texture, resembling that sort of Chinese stuff called pelong, and is remarkable for the purity of its glossy whiteness. They are commonly damasked, and\nthe sacred words, \"Oom mannee paimee oom,\" are usually near both ends, which terminate in a fringe. The meaning, or origin, of this mode of intercourse has never been ascertained; it is of such moment, however, that the Rajah of Bootan once returned a letter to the resident at Rungpoor, which he had transmitted from the governor general, merely because it came unattended with this bulky incumbrance to testify its authenticity.\n\nIt is a general belief in Tibet, that the arts and sciences had their origin in the holy city of Benares, which the inhabitants have been taught to esteem as the source both of learning and religion; Bengal is consequently held in high estimation. The Gangetic provinces are called to this day Anukhenk, or Anonkhenk, and Enaeac by the Tartars. This appellation they have extended to all India. It is asserted, that the art of printing has, from a very remote age, been practised in Tibet, although limited in its use by the influence of superstition. Copies of religious works are multiplied, not by moveable types, but by means of set forms, which they impress on thin slips of paper of their own fabrication. The letters run from left to right. The printed and written character, appropriated to works of learning and religion, is styled, in the language of Tibet, the Uchin; that of business and correspondence Umin. Their alphabet and characters they acknowledge to be derived from the sanscrit. When visited by Captain Turner, in 1783, they were found acquainted with the existence of the satellites of Jupiter, and the ring of Saturn. He also found them accustomed to the game of chess, and the rules and movements similar to those adopted in England. As in Western Tartary, the cycle here used is that of 12 years.\n\nAccording to tradition, the ancient teachers of the faith professed by the inhabitants of Tibet, proceeded from Benares; and, after having advanced towards the east over the empire of China, are said to have directed their course towards Europe. The funeral ceremonies performed by the Calmucks, near the River Wolga, in Russia, on the decease of their chief lama, are nearly the same with those described as taking place at the funeral of a gylong (priest) in Bootan, on the borders of Bengal, which shews the amazing extent of the lama religion, and of the Hindoo system. Their own instruction in science and religion, the Tibetans refer to a period long prior to the existence of either in Europe; but Sir William Jones considered them as Hindoos, who engrafted the heresies of Buddha on their own mythological religion.\n\nThe principal idol in the temples of Tibet is Mahamoonce, the Buddha of Hindostan, who is worshipped throughout the great extent of Tartary, and among all the nations to the eastward of the Brahmapootra, by an infinite variety of names. Durga, Cali, Ganesa with his elephant head, Cartikeya the Hindoo Mars, with many other Hindoo Brahminical deities, have also a place in the Tibet pantheon. The same places of popular esteem, or religious resort, are equally respected in Tibet and Bengal; Allahabad, Benares, Durjodeen, Gaya, Saugor, and Juggernaut, being objects of devout pilgrimage. The regeneration of their lama is said to have taken place in times of remote antiquity, near the site of the ancient city of Gour. Saugor, which is an uninhabited island, covered with jungle, at the mouth of the Calcutta River, and Juggernaut, in Orissa, are deemed places of peculiar sanctity. Those who are unable to perform the pilgrimage in person, acquire a considerable degree of merit by having it performed by proxy.\n\nAbout the 23rd degree of north latitude are the Chumulance Mountains, on some of which the snow\nremains the whole year. The highest peak, named Chamularee, is highly venerated by the Hindoos, who resort here as votaries to pay their adorations to its snow-clad summit. No satisfactory explanation has ever been obtained of the particular sanctity ascribed to this mountain, but it may be observed, in general, that every singular phenomenon in nature becomes an object of worship to the Hindoos; whether it be a snowy mountain, a hot well, the source or conflux of a river, a lake, or volcano.\n\nThe ritual, or ceremonial worship of Tibet, appears to differ materially from that of the Brahminical Hindoos, and from many of their prejudices, especially such as relate to the perplexing distinction of castes, the Tibetans are almost exempt. With the latter religion is all system and order. A sovereign lama, immaculate, immortal, omnipresent, and omniscient, is placed at the summit of their fabric; the Hindoos, on the contrary, acknowledge no individual supreme authority. This lama is esteemed the vicegerent of the only God, the mediator between mortals and the deity. He is also the centre of a civil government, which derives from his authority all its influence and power. A regular gradation is observed from the lama through the whole order of gylongs, or monks, to the youngest noviciate. The president of a monastery is always styled Lama. Their religious monasteries and edifices are all adorned at each angle with the head of a lion, having bells hanging from his lower jaw; and the same figure is equally common at every projection of the palace walls; yet the animal is not a native of the country.\n\nIn Tibet, as in Bootan, the nation appears to be divided into two distinct and separate classes; those who carry on the business of the world, and those who hold intercourse with heaven. No interference of the laity ever interrupts the regulated duties of the clergy. There are two sects of priests, distinguished by their dress; the red or the yellow cap. The latter is reckoned the most orthodox, and has, among his votaries, the Emperor of China. Dalai lama, Teshoo lama, and Tanarath lama, preside over the yellow, who have their residences at Pootalah, Teshoo Loomboo, and Kharka. This sect prevails over great part of Tibet, and a division of the same is said to be established in the Deccan, in a district named Scurra, or Serrora. In like manner three lamas preside over the red sect, viz. Lam Rembochay, Lam Sobroo Nawangmamghi, and Lam Ghassatoo. These have their residence in Bootan, in separate monasteries; the principal of the red class in Tibet has his residence at Sakia.\n\nIt is a custom in Tibet to preserve entire the mortal remains of the sovereign lamas only, every other corpse being either consumed by fire, or, as among the Parsees, exposed in the open air. As soon as life has left a chief lama, the body is placed upright, in an attitude of devotion, his legs being folded under him, with each thigh resting on the instep, and the soles of the feet turned upwards. In this posture they are deposited in shrines; the inferior lamas are usually burned, and their ashes deposited in little metallic idols; but common subjects are treated with less ceremony. Some are carried to lofty eminences, where, after having been disjointed, and the limbs divided, they are left a prey to ravenous, kites, and other carnivorous birds. In the more populous parts of the country, the dogs also come in for their share.\n\nThe dress of the religious orders in this portion of Asia is the regular habit of every attendant at court, consisting of a vest of woollen cloth, with sleeves of a deep garnet colour, and a large mantle, either of the same, or of a thinner texture, resembling a shawl. A sort of philibeg and huge boots of bulgar hides,\nlined either with fur or cloth, complete their equipage.\n\nWith respect to the union of the sexes, a custom prevails in Tibet, at once different from the modes of Europe, where one female becomes the wife of one male; and the opposite practice prevalent over the greater part of Asia, where one male exercises an uncontrolled despotism over many females. Here a custom still more preposterous is found\u2014that of polyandria, one female associating with all the brothers of the family, without any restriction of age or numbers; the choice of the wife being the exclusive privilege of the elder brother. This arrangement differs considerably from the Nair customs on the Coast of Malabar; but a similar practice is said to be followed by the bearer caste in the province of Orissa; yet, when compared with their neighbours, the women of Tibet enjoy an elevated station in society. In the ceremony of marriage the priests of Tibet have no share whatever, it being ratified and completed without their interference. The officers of state, as well as those who aspire to such distinctions, deem it a business ill suited with their dignities and duties to attend to the propagation of the species, which they entirely abandon to mere plebeians.\n\nThe geographical knowledge of the Tibetans is very limited, nor has any accurate information been yet procured of the ancient extent of the kingdom, or the age of their religious institutions. About A.D. 1720 the Emperor of China acquired the sovereignty of Tibet, by interfering in the quarrels of two contending parties. On the 5th of July, 1780, Teshoo Lama died in China of the smallpox, in the 47th year of his age. In December, 1783, his successor, although only 18 months old, and unable to speak, when visited by the British ambassador, conducted himself with astonishing dignity and decorum; such were the effects of early discipline.\n\nThe affairs of Tibet continued in a flourishing and prosperous state until 1792, when the Nepalese, without provocation, commenced hostilities, the first experienced for many years, and invaded Tibet. Their progress was rapid and unforeseen, and they appeared so suddenly before Teshoo Loomboo, as scarcely to allow the lama and his gyelngs time to effect their escape, which they did with great difficulty across the Brahmapootra. The Nepalese army, having plundered Teshoo Loomboo of the accumulated contributions of ages, and the tombs of their most valuable ornaments, withdrew to their own country, where they were pursued by the Chinese, defeated in several actions, and forced to sue for peace on most ignominious terms, being compelled to restore all the plunder captured at Teshoo Loomboo, and to pay an annual tribute.\n\nSince this period the lamas have enjoyed profound peace, but their influence has been much weakened, or rather overpowered by that of their terrestrial protectors, the Emperors of China. These keep officers stationed at the court of Lassa, styled umbas, who are invested with all the real authority, and keep up an intercourse with Pekin by means of jasoos, or communicators of intelligence. (Turner, Bogle, Reinell, Wilford, Saunders, &c.)\n\nTICAO ISLE, (or St. Hyacintho).\u2014A small island, one of the Philippines, situated due south of the large Island of Luzon. Lat. 12\u00b0 30'. N.

Lat. 6\u00b0. 45'. N. Long. 127\u00b0. 25'. E. Both of these islands are remarkably well watered by streams from their respective peaks, which are usually cloud-capped. Tidore is populous, and formerly contained 25 mosques. Its sultan also was a potentate of considerable consequence in this part of the world, as he possessed a great part of Gilolo to the south and east, the chief towns being Maba, Weda, and Pantany; and, besides, claimed sovereignty over Wagecoo, Mysol, and Battanta. In point of fact, he was completely in subjection to the Dutch, who elevated or deposed sultans as best suited their commercial speculations.\n\nOn the 8th of Nov. 1521, Juan Carvallo, one of the surviving companions of Magellan, arrived at Tidore, and was well received by its chief, who granted him a factory for the purpose of collecting cloves and other spices. On the 21st of December he loaded two ships with spices for Spain. Gonzalo Gomez de Espinoza commanded the Trinidad; and it was his intention to proceed to Panama, in Mexico, but he was captured by the Portuguese. Sebastian del Cano went in the Victoria, by the way of the Cape of Good Hope; and, having lost many of his crew during the voyage, arrived at St. Lucas on the 7th Sept. 1722, with only 18 men, three years from the date of their departure from Seville\u2014having thus performed the first circumnavigation of the globe.\n\nIn 1526 a second Spanish squadron arrived at Tidore, where they found the Portuguese had declared war against the chief, on account of the succour he had afforded to the squadron of Magellan. Hostilities in consequence commenced in the Moluccas between these two nations, and continued with varied success until 1529. The Spaniards alleged that these islands were within the Pope's line of demarcation, which was the fact; but the Portuguese were unwilling to relinquish so lucrative a trade. About this period these differences were adjusted, the Emperor Charles V. renouncing his right, such as it was, to the Moluccas, for the consideration of 350,000 ducats, advanced to him as a loan by the King of Portugal.\n\nIn 1779 Drake, the famous circumnavigator, arrived at Tidore, and began to gather spices without the permission of the king, who was at first greatly incensed; but, being afterwards by presents conciliated, his rage abated. (Zuniga, Forrest, &c.)\n\nTijlenking.\u2014A large Malay village on the Island of Java, situated about five leagues east from Batavia.\n\nThis place is intersected by a river, which unites with the Antijol, and afterwards falls into a small shallow bay of six or eight inches water, on a bottom of oyster shells. In the middle of the river is a serpentine channel, navigable for canoes and small country boats. The Chinese here hold a market all the year for the sale of provisions and vegetables, and from hence is sent the greater part of the fresh and salted fish consumed in Batavia and its vicinity. Much salt is also made here. (Tombe, &c.)\n\nTiman Isle.\u2014A very small island situated off the east coast of the Malay Peninsula. Lat. 2\u00b0. 52'. N. Long. 104\u00b0. 5'. E.\n\nThis island is high and woody, and has several others still smaller lying off it to the westward. Vessels bound to India, through the Straits of Malacca, may go within the islands of Timan, Pisang, Aor, and Pulo Tingy, and the main. (Elmore, &c.)\n\nTimaret.\u2014A town in the Nizam's territories, in the province of Beed, 54 miles S. S. W. from Hyderabad. Lat. 16\u00b0. 30'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 27'. E.\n\nTimerycotta.\u2014A town and fortress in the Carnatic, district of Palnaud, 77 miles S. S. E. from Hyderabad. Lat. 16\u00b0. 17'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 20'. E.\n\nTimor, (East).\u2014A large island\nin the Eastern Seas, intersected by the 9th degree of south latitude, and extending obliquely in a north-east and south-west direction. In length it may be estimated at 250 miles, by 40 the average breadth.\n\nIn the year 1630 the Dutch formed their settlement at Coopang on this island, from whence their establishment at Amboyna is still supplied with live stock and other necessaries. The produce of this island is chiefly sandal wood and wax; but the first article is now become scarce, the last continuing abundant. The bees make their nests in bushes and the boughs of trees, to which the natives cannot approach until they have smoked or burned the bees out. The honey is then put into jars, and the wax run into blocks three feet in length, and 12 or 15 inches in thickness. Another article of export is biche de mar, which is partly procured near the island, and partly fished on the coast of New Holland, and brought here for sale. When Captain Flinders was surveying the north coast of New Holland, with the view of exploring the great gulf of Carpentaria he unexpectedly at the bottom of it fell in with six Macassar praws fishing for biche de mar or sea slug. From the commander of these vessels he learned that a numerous fleet sailed annually from Macassar on this expedition, and afterwards carried their cargoes to Timor, where they were met by Chinese traders, who purchased the commodity; and, having transhipped it to their own junks, carried it for sale to the southern ports of China. Each praw carried a crew of 16 or 18 men, for the purpose of collecting this sea reptile, which they afterwards dried with the smoke of green wood. The chief articles of import are opium, piecegoods, coarse cutlery, chinaware, and minkins. The Dutch from hence exported many slaves to their different settlements, and also procured a small quantity of gold annually. Their civil establishment at Coopang formerly consisted of 70 persons, but since the commencement of the revolutionary war it has been greatly reduced. By far the greater part of the traffic is conducted by the Chinese, whose small defenceless vessels, of from 10 to 30 tons, are most unaccountably permitted to navigate these piratical seas unmolested.\n\nThe bread-fruit tree, called by the Malays soccoom, grows here in great luxuriance, and appears to be as much a native of the island as it is of Otaheite. A Timor bread fruit weighs half as much more than one of equal size at Otaheite; but, notwithstanding its name, it is here generally eaten with milk and sugar. On this island there is also a bread fruit that produces seeds not unlike Windsor beans, and, when boiled or roasted, equally palatable. The mountain rice is common in Timor, where, contrary to the practice elsewhere, it is cultivated on dry land. About the year 1790 some of it was procured, and forwarded to his Majesty's botanic garden at St. Vincent's, and to other parts of the West Indies; but no report of its success has ever appeared. The coast of this island abounds with most beautiful shells.\n\nThe Dutch control the north-west and south sides of Timor; but the Portuguese still have a settlement at Dhelli, on the north coast, the miserable relic of their once extensive possessions in these seas. The chief of the natives is by the Dutch styled keyser (emperor), and resides at a place called Brackenassy, four miles from Coopang. In 1789 he was baptized by the name of Bernardus, his native appellation being Bacchu Barnock. The natives on the sea coast are described as very indolent; those of the interior as strong and active, but from their want of cleanliness subject to filthy diseases. Civil wars are frequent among them, which the Dutch say are fomented by the Portuguese; and the Portuguese say are fomented by the Dutch. The latter have\nbeen at some pains to establish Christianity; but have not gained much ground, except in the neighbourhood of Coopang, where prayers are performed by a Malay clergyman, the scriptures having been translated into that dialect.\n\nThe Malays of the more eastern isles adopt so many foreign terms, and the practice is so prevalent, that the term Basa Timor, or the eastern language, is applied to any sort of jargon. In Captain Cooke's first voyage, a resemblance between the language of the people of the South Sea islands, and the inhabitants of many parts of the Indian Archipelago, has been remarked; but the coincidence is found particularly strong at Timor, as well as in the numerals. Besides the dialect, there are some customs among the natives of this island still more striking for their similarity. They practice the Toogctooge of the Friendly islands, which they call Tombook; and the Roomee of Otaheite, which they name Rama. They likewise place on their graves offerings of baskets, filled with tobacco and betel. In 1809 a valuable present of cannon and ammunition was sent by the British government to the Sultan of Timor, who then held out against the Dutch. (Bligh, Stavorinus and Notes, Leyden, Asiatic Registers, &c.)\n\nTimor Laut.\u2014An island in the Eastern Seas, situated betwixt the seventh and eighth degrees of south latitude, and the 132d and 133d of east longitude. In length it may be estimated at 70 miles, by 25 the average breadth. Except its dimensions and geographical position, nothing further is known respecting it.\n\nTinnevelly, (Trinavali, one of Vishnu's Names).\u2014A district in the South of India, situated principally between the eighth and 10th degrees of north latitude, and occupying the south-eastern extremity of what is miscalled the peninsula. To the north it has Madura and Marawas; on the S. E. it is separated from Ceylon by the Gulf of Manaar; and on the west it is bounded by Travancor. In length it may be estimated at 150 miles, by 50 the average breadth.\n\nFrom Travancor this district is separated by a high ridge of woody mountains, of extremely difficult access, its surface being generally flat from the sea coast until these hills are approached. The country for 30 miles to the north of the town of Tinnevelly is open, and tolerably well cultivated. This tract, being situated between the eastern and western polygars, was, during the early Carnatic wars of the last century, the favourite field of their depredations. This district contains no rivers of magnitude, but is watered by many streams flowing from the western mountains, and in favourable seasons yields abundant crops of rice and cotton\u2014the latter is of an excellent quality. A very small proportion, however, of the produce of this district is exported either by sea or land; on the contrary, during unfavourable seasons, rice is sometimes brought from Travancor. The chief towns are Tinnevelly, Tutecoria, Vypaur, Callacand, Natradacotta, and Coilpatam. Being in its immediate vicinity the productions of Ceylon would probably thrive in this district.\n\nThe principal article exported to Madras from the Tinnevelly and Ramnad districts is cotton, which is afterwards consigned for sale to China. In 1811 there was a great deficiency in the cotton crop. The next in value are the various assortment of piece goods, which are generally of a coarse description, and a considerable quantity of jaggory, with some indigo, dry ginger, and cocoanuts. In 1811 chayroot to the value of 34,830 rupees, and cardamoms 2925 rupees, were sent from hence to Madras; but the former was probably the produce of Ceylon, and the latter of the Malabar coast.\n\nThe imports received from Madras are inconsiderable, and consist of liquors and supplies of Europe and China goods for the stations;\nbesides which, a few drugs and articles of small value in use among the natives, either medicinally, or for their numerous ceremonies, are received. The import trade from places beyond the territories of Madras, is principally confined to large consignments of betel nut from Travancor and Ceylon. The foreign export trade consists of piece goods to Bombay and Ceylon, and of chank shells to Bengal. The total value of imports from places beyond the territories of the Madras government, between the 1st May, 1811, and the 30th April, 1812, was 292,113 Arcot rupees, viz.\n\n| From Ceylon | - - - - | 20,614 |\n| Goa         | - - - - | 2202   |\n| Travancor   | - - - - | 251,898|\n| Various places | - - - | 17,399 |\n\nArcot rupees 292,113\n\nThe total value of the exports to places beyond the limits of the Madras Presidency, during the above period, was Arcot rupees 189,152, viz.\n\n| To Calcutta | - - - - | 31,313 |\n| Bombay      | - - - - | 11,506 |\n| Ceylon      | - - - - | 117,709|\n| Various places | - - - | 28,624 |\n\nArcot rupees 189,152\n\nThe principal sea-ports of this district are Vypaur, Tutacorin, Coilpatam, and Colasacarapatam; at which harbours, between the 1st May, 1811, and the 30th April, 1812, 436 vessels and craft, measuring 10,100 tons, arrived; and 336, measuring 8103, departed.\n\nThe Mahomedans in this district are very few, and the primitive Hindoo manners and customs are scarcely anywhere seen so pure and unmixed. Apparently the lapse of 20 centuries has made no change in their habits and customs. The coleries among the hills on the western frontier of Tinnevelly, present nothing of the ugliness or deformity which generally characterize the inhabitants of the hills and wilds of Hindostan; on the contrary, they are tall, well made, and well featured, and are of a martial disposition. Before they were thoroughly reduced to order by the British, their arms were lances and pikes, bows and arrows, rockets and matchlocks; but whether with or without other weapons, every man constantly carried a sword and shield.\n\nIn times of remote Hindoo antiquity, this district formed part of the great Pandian empire, the capital of which was Tanjore. During the early Carnatic wars, from 1740 to 1760, it swarmed with independent polygars with uncounted names, such as the Pulitaver, Nubbee Khan, Cutteck, Catabominague, and Paniakumerutch, in a state of perpetual hostility, each having his fort or den, situated among the woods and fastnesses, which then almost covered three-fourths of the country. At this period, in conjunction with Madura, Tinnevelly was farmed for 11 lacks of rupees of revenue; and low as was the assessment, it generally ruined the farmer, from the difficulty of collection. In this disorderly state it continued until 1792, from which period the Company collected the tribute; but, until very lately, the polygars of many of the smallest tracts of country exercised not only civil but criminal jurisdiction; the services, as well as the lives, of their subjects, being at their disposal.\n\nWhen the war with Tippoo commenced in 1799, and the Madras army was actively employed in his dominions, a formidable insurrection broke out among the southern pollams of Tinnevelly, for the quelling of which a body of troops was marched into the country. This occasion was taken for disarming the polygars, demolishing their forts and strong holds, and reducing them immediately to the civil authority of the Company. A temporary arrangement was also concluded for the revenue, and, in 1801, by treaty with the Nabob of Arcot, the absolute\nsovereignty of the province was acquired. In this year a second insurrection took place among the southern pollams, which was considered to be connected with another, at that time existing in the Dindigul and Malabar countries, but the whole were effectually suppressed.\n\nThe strong measures adopted in consequence of the second rebellion, having produced the effect of general obedience to government, they were followed up by an extension of a permanent assessment of the revenue, which was carried into effect, in 1803; and, in 1806, produced 569,315 star pagodas. In this manner, by the energy of government, and the extinction of a divided authority, one of the finest districts in the Carnatic has been converted from a state of anarchy and confusion to one of subordination and prosperity.

From hence to Teshoo Loomboo the road is level, and it was by this route the Nepaul army marched when it invaded Tibet, and plundered Teshoo Loomboo, in 1792. At this place the Nepalese were defeated by the Chinese. (Kirkpatrick, &c.)\n\nTiperaH, (Tripura).\u2014A large district in Bengal, situated principally between the 22d and 24th degrees of north latitude. On the north it is bounded by Silhet and Dacca; on the south by Chittagong and the sea; to the east it is separated by hills and deep forests from the Birman dominions; and on the west it has the great River Megna, and the district of Dacca Jelatpoor. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"Bordering upon Bhatly is a very extensive country subject to the chief of TiperaH; him they style Yeyah Manick. Whoever is possessed of the rajahship bears the title of Manick, and all the nobility are called Narrain. Their military force consists of 1000 elephants, and 200,000 infantry; but they have few or no cavalry.\"\n\nThis district, also named Roshe-nabad, is the chief eastern boundary of Bengal, and is of very large dimensions. In 1784 it was estimated to comprehend 6618 square miles, but various lands have since been added to it, and its eastern limits are not yet accurately defined. Towards this quarter the country is extremely wild, and overgrown with jungle, abounding with elephants; but that part of it adjacent to the Megna is rich, fertile, and commercial. The inhabitants of the mountainous and woody tract on the eastern frontier are named Kookies, and live in a state of the most savage barbarity. Among these forests the gayal is found in a wild state. That part of the TiperaH district situated on the Megna from Daoudcauny to Luckipoor, is famous for the production of excellent betel nut, which is held in high estimation by the Birmans and Arracaners, who come annually and buy it nearly all up, paying mostly in ready money. This traffic is so regularly established, that they contract for the produce of the betel nut plantations for the succeeding years. The coarse cotton goods of this country are known all over the world by the names of baftea and cossaes, and are an excellent and substantial fabric. They form annually a considerable portion of the East India Company's investment, and are also largely exported by private merchants. The chief towns of this district are Comillah and Luckipoor.\n\nThe number of elephants annually caught in TiperaH is very considerable, but they are reckoned inferior to those of Chittagong and Pegu.\nThe height of this animal has, in general, been greatly exaggerated. In India the height of females is commonly from seven to eight feet, and that of males from eight to ten feet, measured at the shoulder, as horses are. The largest ever known with certainty belonged to Asoph nd Dowlah, the Nabob of Oude, and was taken in 1796; the perpendicular height at the shoulder was 10 feet six inches. One belonging to the Nabob of Dacca measured 10 feet high. The height required by the British government in Bengal for the elephants purchased for their service, is nine feet.\n\nThis district appears to have been the seat of an independent Hindoo principality, for many centuries after the Mahomedans had by conquest obtained possession of the rest of Bengal; but its limits, probably, did not then as now approach the banks of the Brahmapootra and Megna. By Mahomedan historians it is termed the country of Jagenagur. In A.D. 1279 it was invaded by Toghril, the Patan governor of Bengal, who plundered the inhabitants, and brought away 100 elephants. In 1343 it was again invaded by Ilyas, the second independent Bengal sovereign, who carried off many valuable elephants.\n\nFor many succeeding years this state continued to preserve its independence, which is surprising when its vicinity to Dacca, so long the capital of Bengal, is considered. It was, however, at last brought into subjection in 1733; when a nephew of the Tipperah rajahs fled to Dacca and requested assistance, which was granted under the command of Meer Hubbeeb Oolah. This officer crossed the Brahmapootra, and being conducted by the nephew, they reached the capital before the rajah had time to prepare for an effectual resistance; he was, in consequence, obliged to fly for refuge to the forests and mountains. The nephew was put in possession of the government, on condition of paying a large annual tribute; and the whole extensive tract of country became a province of the Mogul empire, itself on the eve of dissolution. When the conquest was completed, the ancient name, according to a Mahomedan practice, was changed to that of Roushenabad; and a body of troops was left under a fowdar to support the young rajah. Along with the rest of Bengal it devolved to the British; and, in 1801, was estimated to contain 750,000 inhabitants, in the proportion of three Mahomedans to four Hindoos. (Stewart, J. Grant, Cox, &c.)\n\nTiroon, (Tirun).\u2014A district on the east coast of Borneo, situated between the third and fourth degrees of north latitude. The coast here is all low mangrove land, the mountains being very distant inland, and inhabited by Idaan, the aborigines of the island. The country abounds with sago trees, which being the chief sustenance of the natives, they plant annually in great numbers to prevent any deficiency, as a considerable time must elapse before they are fit to be cut down. The produce of the country consists principally of sago and bird nests, both of which are in great plenty and perfection. It also yields wax, canes, rattans, mats, honey, biche de mer, and in some parts gold. In this district there are many rivers, the largest, named the Barow, or Curan, from different places near it, has about three fathoms water at the mouth; but there are several shoals, which render the assistance of a pilot necessary.\n\nThe tribes known by the names of Tiroon and Tedong live chiefly on the N.E. coast of Borneo, and are reckoned a savage and piratical race, addicted to eating the flesh of their enemies. Their language is little known, but is reckoned peculiar, and the people are probably a tribe of the aborigines, named Horaforas, Idaan, or Alloreze. (Forrest, Dalrymple, Leyden, &c.)\n\nToken Besseys.\u2014A cluster of\nvery small isles, situated off the east coast of the Island of Booton. Lat. 5\u00b0. 40'. S. Long. 123\u00b0. 35'. E.\n\nThese numerous little islands are all of them either connected with, or surrounded by rocky shoals, between which very rapid currents set strongly to the eastward, and render the navigation hazardous. They are inhabited. (Stavorinus, &c.)\n\nTolou Bay.\u2014A deep bay that indents the east side of the Island of Celebes, the coast of which has been but little explored.\n\nTolour Isle.\u2014The largest of the Salibabo Isles, named by Valentyn Karkallang, and by Captain Hunter Kercolang, situated between the fourth and fifth degrees of north latitude, and about 126\u00b0. 30'. east longitude.\n\nThis island is from 80 to 100 miles in circumference, and is, in general of a good height. The face of the country is composed of steep hills and extensive valleys, every part being covered with trees and verdure. It is well cultivated and populous, the inhabitants being mostly Mahommedans, who wear turbans, and are covered with coarse cotton cloth. Their houses erected on posts are well built, and neatly thatched, the whole exhibiting a considerable degree of civilization.\n\nThe Dutch had formerly a flag here, but, about 1773, the Magindanese exercised a sort of jurisdiction over the island, and exacted a tribute, which was usually paid in slaves. (Captain Hunter, Forrest, &c. &c.)\n\nTomine Bay.\u2014A bay which deeply indents the N. E. quarter of the Island of Celebes, and abounding with small rocky islands and rocky shoals. It is also named Goonong Tellu Bay.\n\nTondi.\u2014A town on the sea-coast of the Southern Carnatic, district of Marawas. Lat. 9\u00b0. 43'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 5'. E.\n\nTongho.\u2014A town, district, and fortress, in the Birman dominions, the latter being accounted a place of uncommon strength. Lat. 18\u00b0. 50'. N. Long. 96\u00b0. 40'. E.\n\nThe province of Tongho is said to be rich and populous, and is usually governed by one of the sons of the Birman monarch, who takes his title from it, being called Tongho Teckien, or Prince of Tongho. The inhabitants excel in the manufacture of cotton cloth, and the land produces the best betel nut in the empire. In this luxury the Birmans of all ranks indulge so freely, that it has become with them almost a necessary of life. The natives of Tongho are famous for their licentiousness and ferocity, and among the Birmans notorious for their insolence and dishonesty. (Symes, &c.)\n\nTonk Rampoorah.\u2014A Rajpoot town in the province of Ajmeer, 60 miles S. by E. from Jyenagur. Lat. 26\u00b0. 7'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 58'. E.\n\nThis fort, with the adjacent district, belong to Jeswunt Row Holkar, and were taken by the British in 1804, but restored at the ensuing peace.\n\nTonoru, (or Yadavapuri).\u2014A town in the Mysore, where are still to be seen the remains of the walls of an ancient city, which indicate that they must have once been of great extent. The reservoir is also a very great work, and said to have been formed by Rama Anuja, about the year 1000 of the Christian era. It is made by a mound erected between two mountains. Tippoo attempted to destroy it by cutting a trench through the mound, in the expectation (it is said) of finding treasure at the bottom. The tank was repaired after the Mysore conquest, and the town is in consequence fast recovering. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nTooljapoort, (Tulyapura).\u2014A town in the Nizam's territories, in the province of Aurungabad, 110 miles S. E. from Ahmednuggur. Lat. 18\u00b0. 7'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 27'. E. This place is unfortified, and contains a number of small pagodas dedicated to the goddess Bhavani.\nTooloombah.\u2014A town in the Afghan territories, in the province of Mooltan, situated on the south side of the Ravey River, 60 miles N. E. by E. from the city of Mooltan. Lat. 30\u00b0. 58'. N. Long. 72\u00b0. 13'. E.\n\nToombuddra River, (Tunga Bhadra).\u2014This river commences near Hooly Onore, where two rivers whose names give it this title meet. The Tunga, which is the northern river, takes its rise in the Western Ghauts, about half a degree south of Bednore; the Bhadra, from a chain of hills situated to the eastward of the Ghauts, nearly opposite to Mangalore, and known by the name of the Baba Booden Hills. After flowing through a jungly country for nearly a degree, it joins its name and waters with the Tunga at Koorly, a sacred village near Hooly Onore. From hence taking a sweep, first northerly and westerly, and afterwards to the east, it continues a very winding course, until it falls into the Krishna, marking the north western frontier of the British dominions in this quarter of Hindostan. (Moor, F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nToomoon.\u2014A small town in the province of Malwah, 84 miles W. by N. from Chatterpoor. Lat. 25\u00b0. 8'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 35'. E. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"Toomur is a town situated on the banks of the River Butnah, in which are seen mermaids. Here is an idolatrous temple, in which if you beat a drum, it makes no noise.\"\n\nTooreyoor.\u2014A town in the Carnatic, 24 miles north from Trichinopoly. Lat. 11\u00b0. 11'. N.

E.\n\nToroff, (Taraf).\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Tipperah, 77 miles N. E. from Dacca. Lat. 24\u00b0. 20'. N. Long. 91\u00b0. 18'. E.\n\nTouradja, (Ta Rajja).\u2014An extensive district in the interior of Celebes, bordering to the north on the Alforeze Mountains, which separate it from the Bay of Tomini; to the east upon Loboe and Wadjo; to the south upon Seedering; and to the west upon the Mandarese Mountains.\n\nA large proportion of the Ta Rajja tribe, who inhabit the central parts of Celebes, are aborigines, and unconverted to the Mahomedan faith. They are said to eat the prisoners made in war. Another portion live entirely on the water in their vessels, continually roving round Celebes, the Island of Ende (Floris) and Sumbhawa. These last are frequently named Boadjoos, and subsist by fishing for biche de mar, and catching tortoises for the shell. (Stavorius, Leyden, &c.)\n\nTournaghaute.\u2014A pass from the Concan province, through the western range of mountains to the interior, 33 miles east from Dabul. Lat. 17\u00b0. 47'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 25'. E.\n\nThis pass is considerably more rugged and steep than that of Ambah. First an ascent occurs of upwards half a mile, on the summit of which, for one mile, the road continues very rocky, when the descent commences, and is, for a mile and a half, very steep, rocky, and difficult. At the bottom of this first ghaut is a plain of some extent, enclosed on all sides by jungle, after which there is another steep to descend, as rugged as the preceding, and of longer continuance. (Moor; &c., &c.)\n\nTourattea.\u2014A small state situated at the southern extremity of Celebes, bounded by Macassar, Bountain, and the sea, and under the influence of the Dutch at Fort Rotterdam. Lat. 5\u00b0. 7'. S. Long. 119\u00b0. 25'. E.\n\nTranquebar, (Tirangaburi).\u2014A Danish settlement in the Southern Carnatic, situated on the sea-coast of the Tanjore province, 145 miles S. by W. from Madras. Lat. 11\u00b0. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 53'. E.\nA Danish East India Company was established at Copenhagen in 1612, and the first Danish vessel arrived on the Coast of Coromandel in 1616, where they were kindly received by the Rajah of Tanjore, from whom they purchased the village of Tranquebar, with the small territory adjacent. Here they erected the fort of Dansburgh, the protection of which, and the correct conduct of the Danish Company's servants, soon attracted population and commerce. The Company however did not prosper, as, in 1624, they surrendered up their charter and property to King Christian IV, in payment of a debt which they owed him. Under a frugal government, the revenues of the port continued sufficient to pay the current expenses, and while Denmark continued neutral her subjects realized vast sums by lending their names to cover British property. On the unfortunate rupture with that kingdom, in 1807, the Danes were deprived of all their settlements in India.\n\nAt present, the commercial intercourse of this small settlement appears principally to be with the Isle of France, Prince of Wales' Island, Ceylon, and Batavia. Its imports are small, and consist of arrack, brandy, copper, and palanirahs; the exports are piece goods. In 1811-12 the total value of its exports were 52,828 Arcot rupees, and of its imports 38,297 Arcot rupees. The import tonnage was only 236 tons, and the export 600. The Rajah of Tanjore continues to receive the Tranquebar tribute amounting to 2000 pagodas per annum. (Macpherson, Report on External Commerce, &c.)\n\nTravancor, (Tiruvancudu).\u2014A province at the south-western extremity of Hindostan, and situated between the eighth and tenth degrees of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by the territories of the Cochin Rajah; on the south and west by the sea; and on the east it is separated from Tinnevelly by a range of lofty hills covered with jungle. In length it may be estimated at 140 miles, by 40 the average breadth.\n\nThe face of the country in this province, in the vicinity of the mountains, exhibits a varied scene of hill and dale, and winding streams. These waters flow from the hills, and preserve the valleys in perpetual verdure. The grandeur of the scene is much enhanced by the lofty forests with which the mountains are covered, producing pepper, cardamomis, cassia, frankincense, and other aromatic gums. In the woods at the bottom of the hills are many elephants, buffaloes, and tigers of the largest size. Monkeys and apes are very numerous, and herd together in flocks.\n\nThe agriculture and productions of Travancor, well adapted to its more favourable climate and superior soil, differ materially from the cultivation and crops of the Carnatic. The wet cultivation is conducted without the aid of tanks, the seasons affording sufficient moisture for the cultivation of rice on every spot fit for that purpose; and as the utmost degree of industry is exerted, the quantity produced in a country like this, where the crops never fail, must be very large. The natives assert this to be so considerable, that the whole of the government expenses, civil, military, and religious, are defrayed from the wet cultivation alone, without infringing on the revenues accruing from the dry species of cultivation. The latter consists principally of the following articles:\n\nPepper, of which from five to 10,000 candies may be produced annually, and valued at 485,000 rupees. For this valuable article the Travancor government only pay the cultivator 30 rupees per candy. Betel nut is also monopolised by government, which makes advances to the cultivator, and resells it at a great profit. Cocoa nut trees are very numerous, and are assessed according\nto their productive powers, and are usually divided into four classes, the tax upon each progressively increasing. An additional tax on this article, levied by the Dewan of Travancor in 1799, caused an insurrection, which continued until the tax was repealed. Of the four sorts of trees, the first are the rarest, and it is observed that north of Quilon (Ceulau) cocoa nut trees are far more abundant than south of it.\n\nThe timber forests of Travancor are in general fanned, the revenue to government varying according to circumstances, but estimated on an average at one lack of rupees per annum. Among the other articles of monopoly are ginger, fanned for 25,000 rupees per annum; coir 30,000 rupees; turmeric 10,000 rupees; and koprah, or dried cocoa nut kernels, 20,000 rupees per annum. Tobacco for the consumption of the province is generally brought from Ceylon, the average quantity being 4000 bales, each of which costs the Travancor government 60 rupees, and is afterwards resold at 220 rupees per bale: 1500 candies of cotton are also annually imported from Surat, upon which the government levy a duty of 45 rupees per candy. The government receives from the purchase of cardamons 100 rupees upon every candy, besides full reimbursement of all expenses attending the original advance to the cultivator, and the charges of transportation.\n\nIn the interior of the Travancor duties are exacted on the transit of all articles, and the payment at one place scarcely ever exempts the trader from a repetition at another, passes being unknown except for some articles that are already fanned. Among other commodities produced in the country, and taxed by the government, are cassia buds, mace, long nutmegs, wild saffron, narwally, coelus indicus, bees' wax, elephants' teeth, and sandal wood. The sea customs of Travancor are fanned, and realize on an average about one lack of rupees per annum.\n\nBesides those above stated, there are various other sources of revenue to the Travancor government, such as taxes on Christian festivals, and upon nets and fishermen; but the most important is a capitation tax on all males from 16 to 60, with the exception of Nairs, Moplas, and artificers. This operates as a tax on the soil, and compensates to the government the light assessment on the grain produce. The landholder is bound for all the cultivators on his estate, and each person is assessed three fanams. The number paying has been estimated at 250,000 persons. The sum total of all these exactions has been conjectured to amount to 20 lacks of rupees annually, which is exclusive of the wet cultivation as mentioned above, and from the detail here presented some idea may be formed of the fiscal regulations under a genuine Hindu government.\n\nPepper, the great staple of Travancor, has fallen so greatly in value as to be almost unsaleable; what formerly brought 220 rupees per candy, has gradually fallen to little above 60 rupees. The East India Company have, in consequence, commuted their subsidy, which used to be paid in pepper, for one in money.\n\nThe old subsidy amounted to - - - - - - - - - - 381,456\nThe new subsidy to - - - - - - - - - - 401,655\n\nRupees 783,111\n\nThe principal sea ports in this province are Anjengo, Coulan, Aibecca, and Coleshy. Strong currents run along the coast which frequently carry ships, bound round Cape Comoin, a considerable distance to the westward. The rajah's usual place of residence is Trivandapatan.\n\nThis province being one of the subdivisions of the Malabar Coast, the manners and customs greatly re-\nsemble those described under the article Malabar. The Hindoo manners are preserved in great purity, this being the only country of Hindostan never subjected to Mahomedan conquest. At a very early period the Christian religion gained a footing in Travancor, and its subsequent progress was so great that this province is now estimated to contain 90,060 persons professing the Christian doctrines. In some parts Christian churches are so numerous, and Hindoo temples so rare, that the traveller with difficulty believes himself to be in India. The most common name given to the Christians of Malabar by the Hindoos of the country is that of Nazarane Mapila (Moplay); but very frequently Surians, and Surianee Mapila. A great proportion of the fishermen on the sea coast of Travancor and Malabar, generally, are Christians.\n\nThe territories of the Travancor chief, whose proper title is Kerit Ram Rajah, were formerly of small extent, and paid tribute to Madura; but, from 1740 to 1755, the reigning king, through a variety of successes, some of which had been gained against the Dutch, added to his dominions all the country as far north as the boundaries of Cochin, and inland as far as the mountains. These conquests were effected in consequence of the rajah having had his troops disciplined in the European manner, by Eustachius de Lanoy, a Flemish officer. In April, 1790, Travancor was attacked by Tippoo, who having forced the rajah's fortified lines, penetrated to Varpally, and but for the interference of Lord Cornwallis would have wholly subdued the province.\n\nOn the 17th of Nov. 1795, a treaty of alliance was concluded between the Rajah of Travancor and the British government; by the conditions of which certain lands taken from him by Tippoo were restored, and he agreed to pay a subsidy equivalent to the expense of three battalions of infantry, to be maintained for the defence of his dominions, and in the event of war to assist the British with his own forces.\n\nBy a second treaty, concluded on the 12th Jan. 1805, with Colonel Macarlay on the part of the British government, the rajah was released from the last-mentioned condition in the former treaty; in consideration of which he engaged to pay annually a sum equal to the expense of one regiment of native infantry, in addition to the sum before payable for the troops subsidized by him. In case of non-payment the British were authorized to collect the amount by their own agent; free entrance being also given during war to all the rajah's forts and towns. Provision was made, that the rajah's income should in no case be less than two lacks of rupees per annum, with one-fifth of the clear annual revenue; and the rajah transferred the management of all his external political relations exclusively to the British.\n\nAs frequently happens in native governments, the dewan, or prime minister of Travancor, attained an influence in the province which wholly superseded that of his master. In 1809 his conduct became so refractory, and hostile to the British interests, that war ensued; and his strongly fortified lines, guarded by a numerous army, were forced by a small detachment of Madras troops, and the whole country in a short time subdued. (MISS. Treaties, C. Buchanan, Fra Paolo, Orme, &c.)\n\nTravancor.\u2014A town in the province of Travancor, 47 miles N. W. from Cape Comorin, and 464 miles travelling distance from Madras.

Long. 78\u00b0. 50'. E.\n\nThe country round Trichinopoly, although not so highly cultivated as Tanjore, is rendered productive of rice by the vicinity of that branch of the Cavery named the Coleroon. The size and situation of the city, the abundance of subsistence in the neighbourhood, and the long residence of Mahomed Ali's second son, Ameer ul Omrah, rendered Trichinopoly the favourite residence of the Mahommedans in the Southern Carnatic. On the adjacent Island of Seringham are two magnificent pagodas, which have long commanded the veneration of the Hindoos.\n\nThis city was the capital of a Hindu principality until 1736, when Chunda Saheb acquired it by treachery, but lost it to the Maharattas in 1741. From these depredators it was taken in 1743 by Nizami ul Muluck, who on his departure to the Deccan delegated Anwar ud Deen to administer the affairs of the Carnatic; and on his death, in 1749, it devolved by inheritance to his second son, the Nabob Mahommed Ali. It in consequence sustained a memorable siege by the French and their allies, which lasted from 1751 until 1755, in the course of which the most brilliant exploits were performed on both sides; but the extraordinary military talents displayed by Lawrence, Clive, Kilpatrick, Dalton, and other officers, and the heroic valour of the British grenadiers, preserved the city, and established the British candidate on the throne of the Carnatic.\n\nAt present Trichinopoly is the capital of one of the districts, into which the territory under the Madras presidency has been subdivided; but up to 1812 had not been permanently assessed for the revenue.\n\nTravelling distance from Madras, 268 miles; from Seringapatam, 205; and from Calcutta, 1238 miles.\u2014(Orme, 5th Report, &c.)\n\nTricoloor, (Tricolur).\u2014A town in the Carnatic, 44 miles west from Pondicherry.

E.\n\nTrincomalee.\u2014A town, fortress, and excellent harbour, in the Island of Ceylon. Lat. 8\u00b0. 31'. N. Long. 81\u00b0. 23'. E.\n\nThis place occupies more ground than Columbo, and is naturally strong; but it contains fewer houses, and is much inferior in population and appearance. The circumference within the walls is about three miles, which place includes a hill or rising point immediately over the sea, and covered with thick jungle. The fort is strong, and commands the principal bays, and in particular the entrance to the grand harbour or inner bay, which affords security to shipping in all seasons and weathers, being sufficiently deep and capacious, and land locked on all sides. This harbour is overlooked by Fort Ostenburgh, erected on a cliff which projects into the sea.\n\n\u2014This fortress is of considerable strength, and was originally built by the Portuguese from the ruins of some celebrated pagodas, which then occupied the spot. Fort Ostenburgh cannot be attacked by sea until the fort of Trincomalee be first taken, and the entrance of the harbour forced. In the bay the shores are so bold, and the water so deep, that it is almost possible to step from the rocks into the vessels moored alongside. At the extremity of the rock on which the fort stands a strong battery is erected, and there the flag staff is placed.\n\nThe harbour of Trincomalee from its convenient situation is one of our most valuable acquisitions in India. When the violent monsoon commences, all vessels on the Coast of Coromandel and east side of the\nBay of Bengal are obliged to put to sea, and then Trincomalee is their only place of refuge. A vessel from Madras can arrive here in two days, and the harbour is to be made at any season. The surrounding country is mountainous and woody, and not so fertile as to attract settlers, the climate being considered one of the hottest and most unhealthy of the island.\n\nThere have been but few European settlers, the society being composed almost exclusively of the officers of the regiments stationed here. The lower classes are chiefly Hindoos from the opposite coast, and a few gold and silversmiths, who are native Ceylonese. By the exertions of Admiral Drury, a colony of Chinese have been established here, who cultivate a large garden, which promises in time to repay their industry. The admiral also imported cattle and poultry, which he distributed among the natives to secure, if possible, a supply for the fleet. Timber is plenty and of easy access, and there are many coves, where ships may be hove down with the greatest safety at all seasons; but the rise of the tide is not sufficient for docks. From the barren and unproductive nature of the country there is here no export trade whatever. The adjacent woods abound with wild hogs, buffaloes, and elephants\u2014the latter being frequently shot within a mile of the town.\n\nIn 1672 M. de la Haye, the commander of a French squadron, attempted a settlement here; but, being opposed by the Dutch government of Ceylon, he bore away for the Coast of Coromandel. In Jan. 1782, it surrendered without resistance to a detachment of troops from Madras, but was shortly after with equal ease retaken by Admiral Suffrein.\n\nIn 1795 General Stewart was sent with an army against Trincomalee, where the fleet anchored to the south east of the foot, and the Dionede frigate was unfortunately lost by striking on a sunken rock. After a siege of three weeks, a breach having been effected and preparations made to storm, the Dutch governor capitulated, although the garrison was superior in numbers to the besieging army. Since this period it has remained with the British, who have considerably improved the fortifications. (Percival, M. Graham, &c. &c.)\n\nTringano, (Trangannu).\u2014A Malay town and principality on the east side of the peninsula of Malacca, and situated between the 5th and 6th degrees of north latitude.\n\nA considerable traffic is carried on here; the king, as in other Malay states, being the chief merchant. The article most in demand is opium, of which above 200 chests are disposed of annually. The other imports are iron, steel, Bengal piece goods, blue cloth, European coarse, red, blue, and green cloths, and coarse cutlery. The commodities paid in return are, gold dust, pepper, and tin; the last article is not the produce of the place, but imported in Malay and Buggees praws.\n\nTraders on their arrival here must first visit the king's merchant, who will introduce them to the king, and to all the male part of the royal family, to whom presents proportioned to their respective ranks must be made. The customs are five per cent, and 200 Spanish dollars must be paid for anchorage, unless a previous bargain be made. For some months of the year this is a dangerous lee shore, and inaccessible to shipping. The gold procured here is of a very fine quality; but precautions must be taken that it be marked with the king's seal, that he may be responsible for its quality. Nearly the whole trade of this coast at present centres in Prince of Wales's Island.\n\nThis petty principality may be considered as one of the most genuine of the modern Malay states, and here that dialect is spoken in its greatest purity and perfection. The government has been occasionally\nTRIPONTARY.\n\nobliged to pay tribute to the Siamese monarch. (Elmore, Sir G. Leith, Leyden, &c.)\n\nTRINOMALY, (Tirunamali).\u2014A town in the Carnatic Province, situated 30 miles S.S.W. from Chittapet, and 30 west from Gingee. Lat. 12\u00b0. 16'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 40'. E.\n\nIn the Carnatic wars of the last century this place sustained many sieges, and was often taken and retaken; but among the natives it was always more famous for its sanctity than its strength. A craggy mountain about two miles in circumference, and rising in the middle to a great height, has, besides others, on the highest rock, a small chapel, which is held in extreme veneration, from the persuasion, that whoever, except the appointed Brahmins, should presume to enter it, would immediately be consumed by a subterranean fire rising for the occasion.\n\nAt this place, in 1767, the combined armies of Hyder and the Nizam were defeated by the British under Colonel Smith, on which occasion the Nizam lost 70 pieces of cannon; but Hyder managed to carry off his artillery. A short time afterwards the Nizam concluded a peace, by the conditions of which he ceded to the East India Company the Balaglaunt Carnatic, the dominions of his late ally, Hyder; possession of which, however, could not be so easily taken.

E.\n\nHere are seen some good houses roofed with tiles, a species of covering found nowhere else in Carnata, and which have probably been constructed by workmen from Madras, where the natives, through long intercourse with Europeans, have greatly improved in all the arts. At this place an attempt was made by Colonel Read to introduce silk worms and the manufacture of sugar, both of which failed.

Lat. 13\u00b0. 9'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 57'. E.\n\nTRIPETTY, (Tripati).\u2014A celebrated Hindoo temple in the Carnatic, 66 miles W. N. W. from Madras. Lat. 13\u00b0. 31'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 33'. E.\n\nThis pagoda is situated in an elevated hollow or basin, enclosed by a circular crest of hills, the sacred precincts of which, during the successive revolutions of the country, have never been profaned by Christian or Mahommedan feet, nor has even the exterior of the temple been ever seen but by a genuine Hindoo. The reciprocal interests of the Brahmins, and the different rulers under whose sway it fell, compromised this forbearance by the payment of a large sum to the government, which in 1758 amounted to 30,000l. sterling per annum. At present it is comprehended in the British possessions, but the revenue derived from it is computed not to exceed half the above sum.\n\nPilgrimages are made to Tripetty from all parts of India, particularly from Gujrat, many the traders of which province of the Banyan and Battia tribes are accustomed to present a per centage of their profits to this temple annually. The incarnation of Vishnu here worshipped is named Tripati, but by the Maharattas he is called Ballajee, and his functions are supposed to have a particular reference to commerce. The temple is described by the natives as being built of stone, and covered with plates of gilt copper, the manufacture of superior beings.\u2014(Wilks, Moor, &c.)\n\nTRIPONTARY.\u2014A town in the territories of Cochin, 10 miles from the port of Cochin. Lat. 9\u00b0. 57'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 20'. E.\nThis place stands on the east side of a lake, which formerly separated the possessions of the Dutch at Cochin from those of the rajah, who generally makes it his place of residence.\n\nTritany.\u2014A town in the Carnatic province, 45 miles W. by N. from Madras.

E.\n\nThis is the usual summer residence of the Rajah of Travancor, but the castle is extremely ill built; the royal palace is large and well built, after the European taste, and decorated with a great variety of paintings, clocks, and other European ornaments. It is not, however, inhabited by the rajah, who prefers residing in a mean edifice, where he is surrounded by Brahmins. The town is populous, and in 1785, in addition to the resident inhabitants, had a garrison of 400 Patan cavalry, 1000 nairs, and 10,000 sepoys, disciplined after the English manner. (Fra Paolo, &c.)\n\nTrivatoor.\u2014A town in the Carnatic province, 60 miles S.W. from Madras. Lat. 12\u00b0. 38'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 40'. E.\n\nTrivicary, (Trivikera). A village in the Carnatic province, situated on the north side of the Arriacoopun, or Vellenore River, about 15 miles W. by N. from Ponilicherry.\n\nThis place at present consists of a few scattered huts; but from the appearance of the pagoda, the interior of which is built of stones, the size of the tower over the gateway, which is eight stories, and a large stone tank covering several acres of ground, we may conclude, that in some former period, Trivicary was a place of greater extent and importance. The principal streets can still be traced, and appear to have been large; but the sanscrit inscriptions on the walls are now scarcely legible. The pagoda was much injured, and the statues mutilated, by Hyder's army, as it retreated from Porto Novo in 1781.\n\nTrivicary is now principally remarkable for the petrifications that are seen in its vicinity. Many petrified trees of large dimensions lie scattered about; some as hard as flint, and others as soft as to be reduced to powder by the slightest pressure. One of the petrified trees is described as being 60 feet long, and from two to eight feet in diameter. The petrified root of this tree is in most places as hard as flint, strikes fire with steel, and takes a much finer polish than any part of the stem. It also presents a more variegated appearance in its veins and colours, resembling agate when polished, and the red, when well chosen, can scarcely be discriminated from cornelians. It is manufactured into beads, necklaces, bracelets, and other ornaments.\n\nThe present growth of trees in the neighbourhood are principally of the tamarind species, from which circumstance it may be inferred, that the petrifications have the same origin. Tradition assigns a great antiquity to these petrifications. (Warren, &c.)\n\nTrividy.\u2014A town in the Carnatic province, 26 miles S.W. from Pondicherry. Lat. 11\u00b0. 44'. N.

During the wars of last century, the pagoda at this place served as a citadel to a large petaab, by which name the people in the south of India call every town contiguous to a fortress.\n\nTrumian.\u2014A town in the southern Carnatic, 44 miles S.S.W. from Tanjore.

E.\nA few miles to the north-east of this place is a forest containing a great many very fine teak trees, which would be of great value, if the timber could be floated down the Tunga to the Krishna, and from thence to the Bay of Bengal. The difficulties are great, but do not appear wholly insurmountable. Immense forests of teak might be reared in this neighbourhood, merely by eradicating the trees of less value. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nTulgom (or Tilligom).\u2014A small town in the territories of the Maharatta peshwa, 18 miles N.W. from Poonah. Lat. 18\u00b0. 46'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 40'. E.\n\nOn the south side of this place there is a large tank which supplies extensive gardens; but in 1805-6, the town and neighbourhood were almost totally depopulated by a famine, in which it is said, in this vicinity alone 80,000 perished. It has since considerably recovered. In 1778 the Bombay army, when on an expedition against Poonah, penetrated as far as Tulgom, where an action was fought with the Maharattas, after which it marched back again. (M. Graham, Moor, &c.)\n\nTumcuru.\u2014A small town in the territories of the Mysore Rajah, containing from 500 to 600 houses. Lat. 13\u00b0. 15'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 12'. E.\n\nThe fort here is well built, and at some distance from the pettah, and the villages in the vicinity are all fortified with a mud wall and strong hedges. The country around is tolerably level, and free from rocks; but few trees are to be seen.\n\nTumlock.\u2014A town in the province of Bengal, district of Hooghly; 35 miles S.W. from Calcutta. Lat. 22\u00b0. 17'. N. Long. 88\u00b0. 2'. E.\n\nThe lands in this neighbourhood lie extremely low, and are protected from inundation by bunds or embankments, which are, however, occasionally broken by the freshes, and the adjacent country submerged. Tumlock is the head quarters of an agency, connected with that of Hijellee, for the manufacture of salt on account of the Bengal government. The article is procured by filtration from the mud found on the margin of the Hooghly river, near its junction with the sea, and is of an excellent quality; in addition to which, it has a peculiar value with the Hindoos, from its being extracted on the banks of the most sacred branch of the Ganges.\n\nMajor Wilford is of opinion, there were formerly kings of Tannralipta, or Tumlook, in Bengal, one of whom in A.D. 1001, sent an embassy to China, and that he was styled by the Chinese Tammoulichou. (Sir H. Strachey, Wilford, &c.)\n\nTunquin.\n\nA kingdom of India beyond the Ganges, formerly independent, but at present comprehended in the Cochin Chinese empire, and situated between the 17th and 23rd degrees of north latitude. To the south it is bounded by Cochinchina and Laos; to the north by the province of Quangsee in China; to the east it has the Gulf of Tunquin; and on the west Laos, Laetho, and part of the province of Yunnan in China. The country known in Europe by the denomination of Tunquin, is properly named Nuoe Anam, and the inhabitants, the people of Anam, which region includes both Cochin China and Tunquin. Cochin China is also named Dangtrong, which signifies the Internal Kingdom, and Thakin, Dangnay, or the External Kingdom.\n\nOur information respecting this country is mostly derived from the French and other missionaries, who at an early period established themselves in this and the adjacent kingdom of Cochin China. According to their narrations, the country of Tunquin towards China is wild and mountainous, and the boundaries not accurately defined. The passes through the mountains are shut up\nby walls, one side of which is guarded by Chinese soldiers, and the other by those of Tunquin. The latter country is subdivided into ten districts; four of which, at the extremities, are distinguished by the cardinal points of the compass. The present capital is Bac-king, or Kee-ho, the last being its original name.\n\nMountains extending from east to west separate Tunquin into two divisions, the northern of which is considerably larger than the southern. A prolongation of these ridges separates Iactho from Laos, and others separate Tunquin from Cochin China. These mountains are high, and many of them terminate in sharp peaks.\n\nThe seasons, or monsoons, here are divided into the wet and the dry; which are not, however, so invariable as in some other parts of India. The rains begin in May and end in August, and are accompanied by much thunder: the currents along the coast run from north to south; the tides are very irregular, and are strongest in November, December, and January, and weakest in May, June, and July; but at all times they run with less force than on the open coasts of Europe. The general appearance of the Tunquin shore indicates a retrogression of the sea, and an advance of the land; but there are some places where the reverse seems to have taken place.\n\nThere are few countries better supplied with water than Tunquin and the lower parts of Cochin China. In the first there are above 50 rivers that flow towards the sea, several of which, by their union, form the large stream which passes Backing. This river has thrown up many islands, and its mouth is now obstructed by a bar of sand, which prevents the Chinese junks from ascending the river to that city. It was navigable 150 years ago, at which period Dutch vessels ascended the stream to within 15 leagues of Backing. At present there are no ports in Tunquin that can be entered by vessels of considerable draught of water; but shelter and anchorage is found among the islands that are scattered along the coast.\n\nThe soil of this kingdom varies according to its locality. In the plains it is rich, light, and marshy, and well adapted for the rice cultivation; among the mountains it is sandy, gipsons, ferruginous, and abounding with stones of different kinds. The country, taken altogether, is one of the most fertile in this quarter of the world, and although populous, during a season of tranquillity, can afford grain for exportation. The chief article is rice of various kinds, and an excellent quality; maize is also cultivated, and different species of yams and leguminous plants. The only European fruit trees that thrive here are the peach, the plum, the pomegranate, citron, and orange. Vines have been planted, but the grapes do not come to maturity. Besides those above mentioned, Tunquin produces all the fruits common to the tropical countries of India, most of which are described under the article Cochin China. The tea plant of an inferior sort is said to be plentiful, and it is probable, that by attentive cultivation its quality might be improved. Mulberry trees are plentiful, and supply food for the silkworms. This country also contains much large timber fit for building, beautiful cabinet woods, particularly the species named eagle wood, of which a considerable quantity is exported, cocoa nut and other palms, bamboos, and rattans. There are mines of various metals, and iron ore is procured in a state of great purity. It is also asserted, there are tin mines in the mountainous track towards China, the working of which is prohibited. Particles of gold are found in many of the Tunquin rivers; but they are more abundant in the mountain streams of Iactho and Laos. Salt and saltpetre are plenty, and the first is reckoned of a superior quality.\nAmong the animals of Tunquin are found the elephant, which is the sole property of the monarch, and the buffaloes, which is employed for agricultural purposes. The horses are a small contemptible breed. Goats and hogs are numerous, as are also ducks and poultry, and all very cheap. The rhinoceroses occasionally discovered, but tigers of the largest size abound; there are some diminutive bears, deer of all sorts, and monkeys of every description. The country generally, but more especially the mountainous parts, is much infested by rats. In Tunquin there are neither hares, sheep, asses, nor camels. The country swarms with vermin, reptiles, and insects, venomous and innocent. Some snakes of great size are found, but their bite is not poisonous. Fish are remarkably plentiful, and furnish the inhabitants with a greater supply of food than they derive from the terrestrial animals; the fishermen in the maritime parts being fully as numerous as the cultivators. In addition to the common sorts of fish there are turtle, tortoises, crabs, shell fish, and molluscs, the substance of which is gelatinous and nutritious, and particularly agreeable to the Chinese, although loathed by Europeans.\n\nThe principal articles which constitute the internal commerce of Tunquin are rice, fish, fruits, fish oil, areca nuts, arrack, salt, oil, sugar, molasses, cassia, bamboos, timber, and iron, the natural productions of the country. The manufactured articles are cotton and silk, worked and in thread, writing paper, wax, varnish, and brass and iron utensils. Among the live animals exposed for sale are elephants, buffaloes, oxen, swine, and ducks. At present the external commerce of the Tunquinese is confined to the coasting trade. In the 17th century the Portuguese, the Dutch, the English, and the French, had factories in Tunquin, but they have long since been abandoned. At present the Chinese are treated with more favour than any other nation, and are allowed to ascend the rivers; a privilege also granted to the Macao Portuguese; but neither are permitted to establish factories on shore.\n\nThe chief articles of exportation from Tunquin are areca, varnish, ebony, ivory, calamine which is carried to Japan, tortoise-shell, sugar, and molasses, a cloth made from the bark of trees, reed and cane mats; cotton and silk, raw and manufactured, and fabrics of mother-of-pearl very neatly worked. From China are imported refined sugar-candy, spices, medicinal plants, drugs, hemp, flax, silk stuffs, mercury, porcelain, glass work, hardware, and copper and iron vessels. Through the medium of the Europeans, firearms and all warlike materials are procured and monopolized by the government. Along the sea coast, in the principal ports, commercial affairs with Europeans are transacted through the medium of a bastard sort of a Portuguese dialect; and this is also the medium of all political communications with the government.\n\nOn account of the fertility of the soil, intersected by numerous rivers, the population of Tunquin is much greater than any other part of the Cochin Chinese dominions, although it suffered severely during the long and bloody wars that took place towards the conclusion of the last century. In this kingdom there are reckoned 12 principal cities, viz. Baeking, or Keeho, said to contain about 40,000 inhabitants; Hanring, 15 to 20,000; Tranhae, 10 to 15,000; Causang, 7 to 8000; Vihuang, or town on the river that passes through Tunquin, up to which the Chinese junks can ascend; Hunnam, a town on the same river, containing about 5000 inhabitants, and in which the Dutch had formerly a factory. Besides these, there are six other towns containing from 6 to 7000 souls.\nThe reigning sovereign has fixed his residence at Phuxuan in Cochin China, and only visits Tunquin occasionally, although it is the richest and most important part of his empire.\n\nOf the ten districts composing the kingdom of Tunquin, the central, named Xunam, is by far the most populous; this division consists of a vast plain watered by numberless navigable streams, is supposed to contain half the population of the country, and in every respect resembles a Chinese province. The total population of Tunquin has recently been computed by a missionary at 18 millions; but this estimate probably greatly exceeds the reality, and he furnishes no account of the facts upon which he grounds his opinion. It is calculated, that one tenth of the inhabitants of Lower Tunquin live constantly on the water.\n\nThe ancient code of Tunquin laws possessed great celebrity, and was highly venerated previous to the last conquest of the country by Caung Shung, the Cochin Chinese emperor. By the missionary Le Roy it is represented as composed in the most elevated style of Chinese, and full of uncommon modes of expression. At present, by the Tunquinese laws, punishments are decreed against all sorts of crimes with great minuteness, but they are badly proportioned, offences against manners and customs being more rigorously punished than crimes essentially dangerous to society.\n\nThe Tunquinese, in their shape and features, greatly resemble the Chinese; but having adopted the practice of blackening their teeth, their appearance is rendered additionally hideous. In Tunquin the ceremony of staining the teeth with a composition, takes place when they attain the age of 16 or 17 years; and it is considered as singularly ornamental, the natives asserting, that white teeth are only fit for dogs. Like the Chinese, the higher classes allow their nails to grow to an immoderate length. The females are marriageable at the age of 12 and 13 years, and are very prolific. Both sexes are much addicted to the chewing of betel, an employment that suits with their habits of indolence. Only extreme necessity can rouse them to any exertion of magnitude; and when their task is accomplished, they relapse into their prior state of sloth and repose. In this respect they differ essentially from their Chinese neighbours, who are laborious and industrious by nature and habit.\n\nIn Tunquin the flesh of many animals is eaten, which in other countries is rejected with abhorrence; the natives not only eat the rhinoceros and particular parts of the elephant, but also grasshoppers, monkeys, horses, and dogs; esteeming the last a particular delicacy: they also eat the mountain rats, lizards, some kinds of worms and snakes. Possessing so great a variety of edibles, the Tunquinese never use the milk of animals in any shape, holding it in extreme aversion, a dislike which also extends to butter and cheese: they have the same repugnance to fresh eggs, preferring those that are nearly hatched. May bugs deprived of their heads and intestines, and silkworms fried, are much sought after. In conformity with the Chinese custom, they never drink cold water, but prefer it tepid, or approaching to the boiling state.\n\nThroughout this kingdom, the bulk of the people are not permitted to build their houses of stone, or several stories high; the larger edifices, such as temples and palaces, are generally constructed of wood, or of wood and brick mixed. The wall which separates Tunquin from Cochin China is 15 feet high, and 20 feet thick, and is extremely ill built of stone and bricks; the latter, for the most part, merely baked in the sun. The roads are commonly very bad; but there is one of a superior description from Backing, the\ncapital of Tunquin, to Phuxuan, the capital of Cochin China, a distance of nearly 500 miles. The manufactures of this province are the same as those of Cochin China, and it is usual to find all the inhabitants of a village following the same trade. It is dangerous, in this country, to be known to excel in any profession or art; as the talents of the artificer are immediately put in requisition to work gratis for the emperor, for the governor of a province, or even for a common mandarin.\n\nThe Tunquinese having originated from China, their language is monosyllabic, and a modification of the Chinese dialect, but so much changed and corrupted, that the spoken language is now wholly unintelligible to a native of China, while the written character is understood, being the same in both countries. Learning is here, as in China, confined to the class of lettered mandarins. Printing is known in Tunquin, but little used, there being only one printing office in the kingdom, which is at Backing, the capital. The types are of wood, and not moveable, every additional book requiring new plates and characters; few, however, are printed, and these have in general a reference to law or religion. The historical works are inaccurate, and not to be depended on. There are a few books on moral subjects, which are mostly translations from, or commentaries on Chinese books; and the sciences here probably remain stationary, in the same stage they had reached 1000 years ago.\n\nThe religion of the Anam nation (Tunquin and Cochin China) is a modification of the Buddhist system, nearly resembling that which prevails in China; but blended with many local and peculiar superstitions. As in China, the Tunquinese have a profound veneration for their parents and ancestors, considering them as tutelary divinities, who watch and protect the families of their descendants, and possessing power in proportion to the sanctity of their lives during their existence on earth: to them sacrifices are offered four times a year, and every third anniversary of their death is celebrated with additional pomp. The higher classes are described as adherents of Confucius, who submit to the worship of images and other ceremonies, through deference to the public opinion.\n\nSome of the more barbarous tribes worship the tiger and the dog; to the first human flesh is offered, and to the last a still more disgusting oblation. Traces of this worship are found among the mountaineers on the borders of India, as well as in the proper Indo Chinese nations, the tiger being also worshipped by the Hajin tribe in the vicinity of Garrow Hills in Bengal. The Quan-to, an ancient race, who inhabit Kauhang, or the mountainous range which divides the Anam countries from China, regard themselves as the original inhabitants of Tunquin and Cochin China, and consider the Anam tribe as a Chinese colony. The Quan-to have a peculiar language, and write with a style on the leaves of a plant, termed jiwa in the Anam dialect. The Moi, or Muong, are also mountaineer races, who speak a language different from the Anam; but it is not known whether they be original tribes, or only branches of the Quan-to.\n\nThe Christian religion was first introduced by the Portuguese about the beginning of the 17th century, and subsequently, while the French had commercial establishments, they endeavoured to communicate the benefits of a religion, which, its most debased and corrupted state, is infinitely superior to the purest of the Indian doctrines. The English and Dutch had also settlements, but never interfered in religious concerns, being wholly absorbed in their commercial pursuits. At an early period the Jesuits sent missionaries to Tunquin, and had made consi-\nderable progress, until being suspected of carrying on a secret political correspondence with the Cochin Chinese, they were expelled. Missionaries were subsequently expedited by Louis XIV. under the character of commercial agents, who settled a factory, which was also intended to promote the conversion of the Tunquinese. On this event the Portuguese Jesuits returned, and disputes arising between them and the French missionaries, the contest was referred to the Pope, who ordered the Jesuits to quit the country.\n\nDuring the 18th century the exercise of the Christian religion was generally prohibited, sometimes tolerated, and at particular periods persecuted with the greatest cruelty. The most noted eras of persecution were A.D. 1712, 1722, and 1773, when the Chinese had considerable influence; but after the civil wars commenced, the government lost sight of religion altogether. The year 1790 was the time when the Christian persuasion experienced the most favourable treatment, missionaries being permitted to settle under the denomination of mathematicians.\n\nIn Tunquin and Cochin China, the missionaries and their converts have suffered much more from the mandarins and inferior officers of government, than from the emperor, who is disposed to be extremely liberal in his religious opinions. He, notwithstanding, exhibits a repugnance to the introduction of all new modes of belief, as an innovation dangerous to a state, where customs have the force of laws, and an alteration in the religious affects the political system.\n\nIn addition to these, other obstacles present themselves to the propagation of the Christian religion in Tunquin, among which is the obligation imposed on every subject of contributing to the support and worship of the national idols, and to appear at certain festivals which have both a civil and religious character. The extreme revenues paid to the manes of their departed ancestors, is also an impediment of considerable weight. The Jesuits tolerated their usages, from which it is not easy to detach the natives, but the court of Rome disapproved of this indulgence. Another objection of great moment with the rich, and with them only, is the renunciation of polygamy, and the being obliged after conversion to restrict themselves to one wife. In spite of all these difficulties the Christian religion has in this region made great progress, and if the missionary statements be correct, in A.D. 1800, comprehended in Tunquin 320,000, and in Cochin China 60,000 persons professing that faith.\n\nTunquin, Cochin China, Cambodia, and Siampa, are recorded to have anciently formed part of the Chinese empire; but on the Mogul invasion of China from Tartary in the 13th century, the Chinese governors of the south took the opportunity of setting up the standard of independence. In this manner several distinct kingdoms were created, the sovereigns of which, however, continued to acknowledge for many years after a nominal vassalage to the throne of China. The Tunquinese princes gradually assumed a greater degree of independence, and about A.D. 1553, are asserted to have subdued Cochin China.\n\nFor some time before and after the above era, the sovereigns of Tunquin, whose title was Dova, were kept under by a succession of hereditary prime ministers, named Chua, similar to the Maharatta Peshwas, or the Mayors of the Palace in France, under the second dynasty. The subsequent history of this country is rather confused, nothing being presented to the mind but a succession of assassinations and revolts, and a perpetual fluctuation of boundaries. About the year 1774 a revolution began, which is described at some length under the article\nCochin China; and after a sanguinary warfare of 28 years, concluded with leaving the empire as it at present exists. Tunquin was finally conquered by Caung Shung, the Cochin Chinese sovereign, about the year 1800, and has ever since been ruled by a viceroy delegated from the seat of government. (De Bissacher, Leyden, Staunton, &c.)\n\nTupple.\u2014A town in the province of Delhi, situated on the east side of the Jumna, 47 miles S. S. E. from the city of Delhi. Lat. 26\u00b0. 3'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 30'. E.\n\nTuptee River, (Tapati).\u2014This river has its source near the village of Batool, among the Injardy Hills, from whence it pursues a westerly direction through the provinces of Khandesh and Gujrat, until it joins the sea about 20 miles below Surat. The whole course, which is very winding, and through a fertile country producing much of the cotton exported from Surat and Bombay, may be estimated at 500 miles. The shoals crossing the mouths of the Tuptee and Nerbudda, are known to the Gujrattees by the names of Shorut and Dejbharoo.\n\nThe first Mahomedan army that crossed the mountains south of the Tuptee, was led, A. D. 1293, by Allah ud Deen, nephew, and afterwards the successor of Feroze, the reigning sovereign of Delhi. (Scott, Drummond, 12th Register, &c.)\n\nTurrah.\u2014A town in the province of Bahar, situated at the southeastern extremity of the district of Chuta Nagpoor. Lat. 22\u00b0. 32'. N. Long. 85\u00b0. 5'. E.\n\nTurivacaray, (or Torovocara).\u2014A town in the Mysore rajah's territories, 47 miles north from Scringapatam. Lat. 13\u00b0. 7'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 50'. E.\n\nThis place consists of an outer and an inner fort, strongly defended by a ditch and mud wall, with a suburb at a little distance containing above 700 houses. It possesses two small temples said to have been built by a Sholun Raya, who was contemporary with Sankar Aseharya, the restorer of the doctrines of the Vedas.\n\nThis prince is famous for having erected temples throughout the country south of the Krishna River, all of them very small, and built entirely of stone. Their style of architecture is also very different from that of the great temples, such as the one at Conjeveram, the upper parts of which are always formed of bricks, the most conspicuous part being the gateway. This last mentioned system of architecture seems to have been introduced by Krishna Raya of Bijanagur, as the Brahmins assert that the 18 most celebrated temples in the Lower Carnatic, were rebuilt by that prince; for they do not allow that any temple of celebrity was erected during the present yug, or age, although nearly 5000 years of it are passed. (F. Buchan, &c.)\n\nTuron Bay.\u2014A commodious bay in Cochin China, named Hansan by the natives, and situated at 16\u00b0. 7' north latitude. The channel into this harbour is round the north east end of the Hansan Peninsula, having an island to the north. All the coast is safe to approach, the water shoaling gradually from 20 to seven fathoms. The bottom is mud, and the anchorage safe throughout. A small island within the harbour is nearly surrounded with such deep water, as to admit of vessels lying close alongside to heave down or refit. At the southern extremity of the harbour is the mouth of the river, which leads to Turon city. It is about 200 yards wide, with about two fathoms depth, and its current into the bay sufficiently strong to excavate a channel through the sand banks. The rise and fall of the tides is very unequal, at one time only six feet, and at others so high as 11 or 12 feet. In the neighbourhood of Turon, and along the adjoining coast, the winds have been found variable all the year through, the periodical winds losing their in-\nfluence near the shore. September, October, and November, are the seasons of the rains, at which times the rivers inundate the low country.\n\nThe town of Turon stands about a mile above the mouth of the river, and as well as the peninsula, harbour, and river, is named by the natives Hansau. The houses it contains are low, and mostly built of bamboos, which are covered with reedy grass, or rice straw. The opposite side of the river is divided into fields surrounded by fences, and cultivated with tobacco, rice, and sugar canes. The markets in the town is plentifully supplied with the vegetable produce of tropical climates, and large quantities of poultry, especially ducks. The bay abounds with fish, and in some of the boats the fishermen reside with their families all the year round. Great numbers of flying fish are here taken by letting down into the sea deep earthen vessels, with narrow necks, and baited with pork, or the offals of fish. All the gelatinous substance, whether animal or vegetable, are considered by the natives of this coast, generally, as extremely nutritious.\n\nThis port was anciently the chief mart for the trade of Cochin China with the Chinese empire and Japan, but, prior to 1793, when visited by Lord Macartney, the city of Turon had suffered greatly by the civil wars, and was surrounded by extensive masses of ruins. In 1787 the Peninsula of Hansan, or Turon, was ceded to the French by the sovereign of Cochin China, in return for assistance promised him; but the French revolution breaking out, possession was never taken. The vessels that resort here at present are either junks from different parts of China, or craft belonging to the Portuguese of Macao. These last carry on a considerable portion of the foreign trade of this country, where they dispose of the refuse of European goods, which they buy up in the Canton market.\n\nThe country to the S.W. of Turon is level and fertile, and the soil mostly clay mixed with sand. Along the coast are seen many rivers and canals, with boats of various sizes, and some junks of above 100 tons burthen. (Staunton, Barrow, &c.)\n\nTuticorin.\u2014A town on the sea-coast of the province of Tinnevelly, 85 miles N.E. from Cape Comorin. Lat. 8\u00b0. 54'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 23'. E.\n\nAt this place there is a pearl fishery, but the pearls found are much inferior to those procured in the Bay of Condatchy in Ceylon, being stained with a blue or greenish tinge. The Dutch had here formerly a fort and factory.\n\nTwenty-four Pergunnahs.\u2014A small district in the province of Bengal, situated chiefly to the south of Calcutta, on the east side of the River Hoogly. In extent it comprehends about 882 square miles, and was first formed into a land-holder's jurisdiction in Dec. 1757, and constituted the zemindary of the Company, and jaghre of Lord Clive. In 1765, a ten years prolongation of the jaghre to Lord Clive was obtained, after which it reverted to the East India Company.\n\nSince that period, from the quantity of waste land brought into cultivation, and the number of ghants (landing places), religious temples, and other buildings constructed, it would appear that this territory has progressively improved with respect to population, cultivation, and commerce. Within its boundaries there are 190 seminaries, in which are taught the Hindoo law, grammar, and metaphysics. These institutions are maintained from the produce of certain charity lands, and by the voluntary contributions of opulent Hindoos; the annual expense being estimated at 19,500 rupees. There is but one madrissah, or college, in which the Mahomedan law is taught, in the 24 Pergunnahs and districts adjacent to Calcutta. It contains no brick or mud forts, but such as are extremely old, or in\nruns; and, although so close to the presidency, is greatly infested by dacoits, or river pirates, who rob, torture, and murder.\n\nIn the 24 Pergunnahs and contiguous districts, the Hindoo inhabitants are reckoned in the proportion of three to one Mahomedan; and the number of inhabitants of all descriptions, taken in the actual enumeration of the farms, may be estimated at 1,625,000. If to these be added the inhabitants of Calcutta, computed by the police magistrates at 600,000; the total population of the 24 Pergunnahs, the town of Calcutta, and the adjacent districts within 20 miles, will amount to 2,225,000 persons. (J. Grant, 5th Report, &c.)\n\nTwenty-Four Rajahs, (or Chowbeisia).\u2014A large district in Northern Hindostan, situated between the 28th and 30th degrees of north latitude, and divided into 24 petty principalities, the whole of which are tributary to the government of Nepaul. Respecting these states little is known except their names, which are as follows: 1. Lainjung; 2. Kaski; 3. Tunhoo, or Timnohoo; 4. Gulkot; 5. Purbot, or Mullibum; 6. Neakote; 7. Pyoon; 8. Lutta-hoon; 9. Bhurkote; 10. Gurhoo; 11. Reesing; 12. Ghering; 13. Dhoar; 14. Palpah (the low land of which is named Butool); 15. Goolmi (ditto); 16. Wigha; 17. Khauchi; 18. Dang; 19. Moosikote; 20. Purthana; 21. Jhilli; 22. Sulliana; 23. Dhurokote; 24. Ismah. (Kirkpatrick, &c.)\n\nTwenty-Two Rajahs, (or Bans).\u2014A district in Northern Hindostan, tributary to the Nepulese, and divided into 22 petty principalities, the following being the names of the largest.\n\nJamlah, Jajarkote, Cham, Acham, Roogun, Moosikote (second), Roalpa, Mullijanta, Bnluang, Dylick, Suliana (second), Bamphi, Jehavi, Kalagong, Ghoriakote, Gootum, Gujor, and Darinneca. (Kirkpatrick, &c., &c.)\n\nTyrhoot, (Trihuta).\u2014A district in the province of Bahar, situated principally between the 27th and 28th degrees of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by the districts of Moowanpoor and Muckwany, which are subject to Nepaul; on the south it has Hajypoor and Boghipoor; to the east is the Bengal district of Purneah; and on the west Bettiah and Hajypoor. In 1784 Tyrhoot was estimated to contain, in all its dimensions, 5033 square miles. By Abul Fazel, in 1582, it is described as follows:\n\n\"Sircar Tyrhoot, containing 74 mahals, measurement 266,464 bee-gahs. Revenue 19,179,777 dauns. This sircar furnishes 700 cavalry, and 80,000 infantry.\"\n\nAlthough not hilly, the surface of this district is more elevated, the soil drier, and the climate generally healthier than those more to the south; yet during the summer the heat is intense. On account of its natural advantages it was selected by the Company as an eligible station for improving the breed of horses, in their provinces, those peculiar to Bengal being of the most contemptible description, and some of them not larger than mastiffs. A low and moist situation seems uncongenial to the nature of this valuable animal, which there degenerates immediately, while it appears to thrive in arid tracts almost destitute of water. Many horses of the first quality have since been reared in this and the adjoining district of Hajypoor, and horse dealers from Upper Hindostan attend the fairs to purchase them. A considerable number are also obtained for mounting the Kings and Company's cavalry.\n\nThis district throughout is, in general, well cultivated, and very productive of grain, sugar, and indigo. Towards the northern frontier there are extensive forests, but no supply of timber deserving of note can be procured, for want of depth of water in the rivers. Could this be remedied, large quantities might be obtained. The names of the chief\nrivers are the little Gunduck, the Bhagmati, and the Gogary.\n\nTirabhucti, corrupted into Tyhoot, was in the remote eras of Hindoo antiquity, named Maithila, and was the seat of a powerful empire, in which a distinct dialect was spoken, still named Maithila, or Trihatya, and used in the territory limited by the Coosy and Gunduck rivers, and the mountains of Nepaul. During the wars of the Ramayma, its sovereign was Janaca, whose daughter, the far famed Secta, espoused the great Rama, whose exploits are narrated in that mythological poem. Tyhoot appears to have continued an independent Hindoo principality until A.D. 1237, when it was invaded by Toghun Khan, the Mahomedan governor of Bengal, who extorted a large sum of money from the rajah, but did not retain permanent possession of the territory. It was finally subdued about A.D. 1325, by the Emperor Allah ud Deen, who annexed it to the throne of Delhi.\n\nAlong with the rest of the province it devolved to the British, and was permanently assessed for the revenue about the year 1794; since which period the improvement of this district, with respect to population, cultivation, and commerce, has been very great; large tracts of jungle and waste land are annually brought into a productive condition by the zemindars. In 1801, when the population returns were ordered by the Marquis Wellesley, the inhabitants of this district were estimated at 2,000,000, in the proportion of one Mahommedan to four Hindoos. (J. Grant, Colebrooke, Stewart, &c.)\n\nU.\n\nUdipu.\u2014A small town in the province of South Canara, situated about three miles from the sea, near a small river called the Papanasani. Lat. 13\u00b0.16'. N. Long. 74\u00b0.48'. N.\n\nThis place contains between two and 300 houses, with three temples and 14 matams, or colleges, belonging to the Suryassies. The last are large buildings, and considered as houses belonging to genuine Hindoos, are stately edifices. The temples are roofed with copper, but it is very rudely wrought. Therice grounds reach from Udipu to the sea, but their extent north and south is not considerable. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nUMMERAPOOR, (Amarapura, the City of the Immortals).\u2014A large city of India beyond the Ganges, and the modern capital of the Birman empire. Lat. 21\u00b0. 55'. N. Long. 96\u00b0. 7'. E.\n\nThis metropolis stands on the banks of a deep and extensive lake, about seven miles long, by one and a half broad. When filled by the periodical rains, the lake on the one side, and the river on the other, form a dry peninsula, on which the city is placed. On entering the lake, when the floods are at the highest, the number and variety of the boats, the great expanse of water, with the lofty surrounding hills, present an extraordinary sight to a stranger.\n\nThe fort of Ummepoor is an exact square. There are four principal gates, one in each face, and there is also a smaller gate on each side of the great gate, equidistant between it and the angle of the fort, comprising 12 gates in all. At each angle of the fort there is a large quadrangular bastion which projects considerably, there are also 11 smaller bastions on each side, including those over the gateway. Between each of these bastions is a curtain extending 200 yards in length, from which calculation it results, that a side of the fort occupies 2400 yards. The ditch of the fort is wide, and faced with brick; the passage across is over a causeway formed by a mound of earth, and defended by retrenchments. The rampart, faced by a wall of brick, is about 20 feet high,\nexclusive of the parapet, which has embrasures for cannon and apertures for musketry. The body of the rampart is composed of earth, sustained within and externally by strong walls. Small demi-bastions project at regular distances; and the gates are massive, and guarded by cannon. This fortress, considered as an eastern fortification, is respectable, but insufficient to resist the approaches of an enemy skilled in artillery tactics. From the height and solidity of the wall the Birmans consider it impregnable, although a battery of half a dozen well-served cannon would breach it in a few hours. The southern face of the fort is washed during the rainy season by the waters of the lake, and the houses of the city and suburbs extend along the bank as far as the extreme point of land.\n\nIn Ummerapeor there are few houses of brick and mortar, and these belong to members of the royal family. The houses of the chief persons are surrounded by a wooden enclosure; and all houses whatever are covered with tiles, and have on the ridge of the roof earthen pots filled with water, in readiness to be broken should fire occur. The splendour of the religious buildings is very striking, owing to the unbounded expenditure of gilding, which is applied to the outside of the roofs as well as within, and must absorb immense sums. The gold leaf used is exceedingly pure, and bears exposure to the air for a long time without suffering injury. These edifices being generally composed of wood and other perishable materials, their existence is not of any long duration. Contiguous to the fort is a small street, entirely occupied by the shops of silversmiths, who expose their ware in the open balcony, and display a great variety of Birman utensils.\n\nThe pudigaut tick, or royal library, is situated at the north-west angle of the fort, in the centre of a court paved with broad flags. The books are kept in wooden chests curiously ornamented, about 100 in number, and well filled\u2014the contents of each chest being written in gold letters on the lid. The greater part concern divinity; but history, music, medicine, painting, and romance, have also their separate volumes. Across the lake there are extensive fields of wheat, which is sold in the city at the rate of one tacket (nearly 2s.6d.) for 56 pounds weight, and equal in quality to the finest in England.\n\nThe city of Ummerapoor is divided into four distinct subordinate jurisdictions, in each of which a Maywoon presides. This officer, who in the provinces is a viceroy, in the capital has the functions of a mayor, and holds a civil and criminal court of justice. In capital cases he transmits the evidence, with his opinion in writing to the lotoo, or grand chamber of consultation, where the council of state assembles. There are regularly established lawyers, who conduct causes and plead; eight are licensed to plead before the lotoo, and their usual fee is 16s.\n\nUmmerapoor was founded by the Birman monarch, Minderajee Praw, so recently as 1783, about four miles east from old Ava, the ancient capital. Buildings in this part of India are almost wholly composed of wood; and the river presenting a convenient water carriage, the present capital rose most rapidly, and became in a short time one of the most flourishing and well-built cities of the east. About A.D. 1800, the population was estimated by Captain Cox at 175,000 persons, which is probably within the actual number; and the number of houses from 20,000 to 25,000. (Symes, Cox, &c.)\n\nUmnabad, (Aminabad).\u2014A town in the province of Bejaapoor, 39 miles N. E. from Poonah. Lat. 18\u00b0. 51'. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 27'. E.\n\nUmrut, (Amrita).\u2014A town in the province of Aurungabad, 40 miles S. by E. from Surat. Lat. 20\u00b0. 40'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 18'. E.\nUstee.\u2014A town belonging to the Nagpoor Maharattas, in the province of Berar, 50 miles E. from Ellichpoor. Lat. 21\u00b0. 18'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 52'. E.\n\nV.\n\nVackaleer, (or Wacaderay).\u2014A town in the Mysore Rajah's territories, situated a few miles S. W. from Colar.\n\nThis place contains above 100 houses, and is fortified with a wall and citadel, both of mud. The farmers in this town occupy 17 houses, and 22 are inhabited by Brahmins, who live better, and are better lodged than the others, although, except two or three officers of government, all the rest Brahmins subsist on charity.\n\nVadaghery, (or Vadacurray).\u2014A Moplay town on the sea coast of Malabar, 24 miles N. by W. from Calicut. Lat. 11\u00b0. 35'. N. Long. 75\u00b0. 40'. E.\n\nThis place stands at the end of a long inland navigation, running parallel to the coast, and communicating with the Cotta and some other rivers. The town is considerable, and, like other Moplay towns in Malabar, is comparatively well built. On the hill above it is a small fort nearly in ruins. (F. Buchanau, &c.)\n\nVadagary.\u2014A town in the Southern Carnatic, district of Tinnevelly, 86 miles N. by W. from Cape Comorin. Lat. 9\u00b0. 12'. N. Long. 77\u00b0. 25'. E. During the Carnatic wars, from 1740 to 1760, this place was possessed by a tributary polygar, who gave a great deal of trouble both to the Nabob of the Carnatic, and to the Company's government.\n\nValvar.\u2014A town in the province of Gujrat, situated on the River Mahy, 20 miles E. S. E. from Cambay. Lat. 22\u00b0. 17'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 5'. E.\n\nVardoopettah.\u2014A town in the province of Tinnevelly, 23 miles S. S. W. from Madura. Lat. 9\u00b0. 36'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 1'. E.\n\nVarshain.\u2014A town in the Afghan territories, in the province of Lahore, 38 miles east from the Indus. Lat. 31\u00b0. 47'. N. Long. 71\u00b0. 40'. E. To the north of this town the hills abound with fossil salt.\n\nVaypen.\u2014A small town in the territories of the Cochin Rajah, adjacent to the town of Cochin. Lat. 9\u00b0. 58'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 7'. E.\n\nThis place stands upon a narrow island of the same name, which extends along the coast 13 miles, and is only one mile in breadth. The soil of this insular stripe consists of sea sand and calcareous matter, combined with various kinds of earth and clay, which during the rainy season are washed down from the Western Ghant Mountains. (Fra Paolo, &c. &c.)\n\nVazirabad, (or Monara).\u2014A town in the Seik territories, in the province of Lahore, situated on the east side of the Chinab River, 47 miles N. W. W. from the city of Lahore. Lat. 32\u00b0. 25'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 28'. E.\n\nVeergoon.\u2014A town and fortress in the province of Cutch, on the road from Luckput Bunder to the port of Mandavie on the Gulf of Cutch, from which last place it is about 30 miles distant to the northward.\n\nVeergoon is a small populous town, situated on the S. W. side of a castle, which is defended by round towers, and flanked by a tank on the north east. The road from Tahrah to this place is a heavy sand; but in many spots the country is well cultivated, and the soil a sandy loam. The road from hence to Bawat is narrow, but in general good, except where the fissures being deep have permitted the water to accumulate. (Maxfield, &c. &c.)\n\nVehy.\u2014A small district in the province of Cashmere, situated between the 34th and 35th degrees of north latitude, and intersected by the Jellum River, named also the\nColhunah. By Abul Fazel it is described as producing much saffron. The chief town is Pampre.\n\n**Vele Rete.**\u2014A cluster of rocks in the Eastern Seas, situated to the south of the Island of Formosa, which may be seen from hence, Lat. 21\u00b0. 56'. N. Long. 121\u00b0. 36'. E.\n\nThe largest of these rocks is about the height of a small ship's hull out of the water, and in clear weather may be discerned at the distance of eight miles. It is surrounded by many smaller ones, making a circumference of about two miles. (Meares, Krusenstern, &c.)\n\n**Vellore, (Vello).**\u2014A small district in the Carnatic Province, bounded on the west by the Eastern Ghauts, and at present comprehended in the Arcot collectorship.\n\nA greater degree of verdure prevails here than is usually seen in the Carnatic, owing probably to a subterraneous supply of water. During the dry season the whole of the rice land is irrigated by means of canals, which are either dug across the dry channel of rivers, below the surface of which there is always moisture found, or it is conducted from places in which subterranean streams have been discovered. In some parts of this district, near the Palar River, indigo is cultivated.\n\n**Vellore.**\u2014A town and fortress in the Carnatic Province, the capital of a district of the same name. Lat. 12\u00b0. 55'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 18'. E.\n\nThis was formerly a post of great importance, as it commanded the main road leading to the Upper Carnatic, from the valley of Veniamanbady, which is the most direct route to and from the Mysore. The walls of the fort are built of very large stones, and have bastions and round towers at short distances. A fausse bray lines the wall between them, and with its embattled rampart and small overhanging square towers produces a very handsome effect. A deep and wide ditch, cut chiefly out of the solid rock, surrounds the whole fort, except at one entrance, where there was a causeway according to the Hindostany system; and, in addition to the usual defence, the ditch contains alligators of a very large size. This fortress is so completely commanded from the hills, that a six-pounder can throw a shot over it; but the conquest of Mysore has rendered it now of little comparative consequence.\n\nThe Mahommedan states of Golconda and Bejapoor possessed themselves of Vellore and Chanderberg in A.D. 1646. In 1677 Sevajee made an unexpected irruption into the Carnatic, and captured this place and Gingee. In the war of 1782 it was relieved by Sir Eyre Coote in the face of Hyder's whole army. After the conquest of Seringapatam and destruction of the Mahommedan dynasty, Tippoo's family were securely removed to this fortress, and consisted in all of 12 sons and eight daughters. Futtch Hyder, the eldest but illegitimate son, had 12 or 14 children. The four elder sons were allowed 50,000 rupees per annum, and the younger 25,000 each. The females were nearly 800 in number, and were handsomely provided for, their condition being altogether much better than it would have been under any successor of Tippoo's. They had been collected from many different quarters, and each furnished her apartment according to the fashion of her own country.\n\nOn the 10th July, 1806, a most atrocious revolt and massacre took place; in which, from extensive evidence taken immediately after the event, it was proved, the family of Tippoo, particularly the eldest, Moiz nd Deen, took an open and active part. The insurgents were subdued, and mostly put to the sword by Colonel Gillespie and a party of the 19th dragoons; and, to prevent the recurrence of a similar calamity, the instigators were removed to Bengal.\n\nTravelling distance from Madras, 88 miles, W. by S.; from Seringapatam, 202 miles. (Lord Valentia, Rennef, Wilks, &c.)\nVellum.\u2014A town in the Southern Carnatic, seven miles S.W. from the city of Tanjore. Lat. 10\u00b0. 40'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 7'. E.\n\nVenkatigerry, (Vanakelugiri).\u2014A town in the Carnatic Province, 82 miles N.W. from Madras. Lat. 13\u00b0. 56'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 32'. E.\n\nVeniambady.\u2014A village fortified with a mud wall, in the Barramahal Province, 120 miles W.S.W. from Madras. Lat. 12\u00b0. 42'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 42'. E.\n\nThis place has a very pleasing appearance, being surrounded with trees, which are scarce in the Barramahal, and situated on a fine plain enclosed by hills. It stands also on the banks of the Palar, or milk river, which in Sanscrit is called Cshira Naddi, and has its source near Nundydroog. During the rainy season this river frequently commits great devastation, and it rises highest when the rains prevail on the Coast of Coromandel. In Veniambady are two temples of note, one dedicated to Mahadeva or Siva, and the other to Vishnu. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nVentivalum.\u2014A town in the Carnatic Province, 40 miles W.N.W. from Pondicherry. Lat. 12\u00b0. 10'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 25'. E.\n\nVeramally.\u2014A town in the Southern Carnatic, 23 miles S.W. from Trichinopoly. Lat. 10\u00b0. 26'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 35'. E.\n\nVicaravandy.\u2014A town in the Carnatic Province, 22 miles W.N.W. from Pondicherry. Lat. 12\u00b0. 5'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 43'. E.\n\nVictoire Isle.\u2014A very small island in the Eastern Seas, covered with wood. Lat. 1\u00b0. 39'. N. Long. 106\u00b0. 30'. E. On the south-west side of this island is a small bay or creek; and S.E. by E. distant three leagues, lies a small white island.\n\nVictoria Fort.\u2014This is a fortified island on the coast of the Concan, about 70 miles south from Bombay, which commands a harbour six miles to the north of Severndroog. Lat. 17\u00b0. 56'. N. Long. 72\u00b0. 55'. E.\n\nThis place, formerly named Barcoot, was taken in 1756 by Commodore James, in concert with the Maharattas, who ceded it to the East India Company. At this period in the adjoining territory the Mahomedans were numerous, and contributed to supply Bombay with beeves, which were difficult to be procured along this coast, on account of the prevalence of the Hindoo religion. (Orme, &c.)\n\nVijanagram, (Vijayanagara).\u2014A town in the Northern Circars, 25 miles N. by W. from Vizapatanam, and formerly the capital of a large zemindary. Lat. 18\u00b0. 4'. N. Long. 83\u00b0. 30'. E. This is a town of considerable size, situated under the northern hills, and having a very large tank to the south. The surrounding country is well supplied with water. (Upton, &c.)\n\nVindhya Mountains.\u2014A chain of hills which passes through Bahar and Benares, and continues on thro' the provinces of Allahabad and Malwa along the north side of the Nerbudda, almost to the west coast of Hindostan. They are inhabited by the Bheels and other tribes of predatory thieves.\n\nVenkatigerry.\u2014A town in the Mysore Rajah's territories, 120 miles W. from Madras. Lat. 13\u00b0. 2'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 38'. E.\n\nThis place was formerly the residence of the Pedda Naika polygar, and the ruins of his fort are still conspicuous. It is built on a rising ground, and consists of several enclosures surrounded by walls of stone and mud, flanked with towers and bastions, which rise higher and higher towards the central enclosure, in which stood the rajah's dwelling. The inhabitants here are almost all Telingas, or Gentoos, as they are named by the English at Madras. The strata here resemble those of the Eastern Ghaut Mountains, and iron is procured by smelting a species of black sand. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nVingorla.\u2014A town belonging to the Rajah of Colapoor, on the sea-\ncoast of the province of Bejapoor. Lat. 15\u00b0. 54'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 22'. E.\n\nVirague.\u2014A town and mud fort in the Nizam's territories, in the province of Aurungabad, 100 miles S. E. from Ahmednuggur. Lat. 18\u00b0. 11'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 15'. E.\n\nViranchipura.\u2014An open town in the Carnatic province, district of Vellore, situated on the south side of the Palar River. Lat. 12\u00b0. 56'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 5'. E.\n\nThis was formerly a large place, and possessed many public buildings, both Hindoo and Mahommedan, but the whole suffered extremely during the wars of last century with Hyder. A large temple, dedicated to Iswara, escaped the destruction that befell the rest, owing to its having been surrounded by a very strong wall of cut granite, which excluded irregulars; and Hyder took no delight in the demolition of temples, as his son Tippoo did. (F. Buchanan, &c.)\n\nVirapelle, (Varapalli).\u2014A town in the Cochin district on the Malabar Coast, five miles N. from the town of Cochin. Lat. 10\u00b0. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 10'. E.\n\nThis is the residence of the apostolick vicar of the Roman Catholic Christians who superintends 64 churches, exclusive of the 45 governed by the Archbishop of Cranganore, and also of the large dioceses under the bishops of Cochin and Quilon, whose churches extend to Cape Comorin. There is here a seminary, a catechumen house, and convent of bare-footed Carmelites, who have the care of the missionary establishment on the Coast of Malabar. The Monastery was founded in A.D. 1673. (C. Buchanan, Fra Paolo, &c.)\n\nVirnaugh.\u2014A village in the province of Cashmere, 37 miles S. E. from the city of Cashmore. Lat. 34\u00b0. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 13'. E.\n\nThe country in this neighbourhood produces apples, pears, peaches, apricots, cherries, and mulberries, besides the red and white rose, and an infinite variety of flowering shrubs. Except the mulberry, few of the fruits or vegetables of Hindostan are produced here. Near to Virnaugh a torrent of water bursts from a mountain, and soon forms a considerable stream. A basin of a square form has been constructed, it is said, by Jchangire, to receive the water, where it reaches the plain. (Foster, &c., &c.)\n\nVizagapatam.\u2014A town on the sea-coast of the Northern Circars, the capital of a district of the same name. Lat. 17\u00b0. 42'. N. Long. 83\u00b0. 28'. E.\n\nA river coming from the north, and turning short eastward to the sea, forms an arm of land one mile and a half in length, and 600 yards in breadth, nearly in the middle of which the fort of Vizagapatam is placed. The town is inconsiderable, the Europeans generally residing at Watloor, a village to the north of this harbour. During the ebb the surf is here very considerable; and, as European boats, for want of Masulah craft, are obliged frequently to go in, they should keep close to a steep hill, named the Dolphin's Nose, to escape being upset. The surrounding country is mountainous, and many of the hills wild, and destitute of vegetation. At Sennachellum, near to this place, is a Hindoo temple of great fame and sanctity.\n\nThe principal trading towns of this district are Vizagapatam and Bimlipatam. From Calentta the imports consist of cumin seeds, long pepper, wheat, and Madeira wine; and from Ceylon and the Maldives islands, large supplies of cocoa nuts, coir, and cowries. Wax, salt, and coir compose the principal articles of export to Calcutta, and rice to the Maldives. The consignments to London are chiefly of indigo, and the staples of the port are wax, salt, and indigo. The total value of the imports, from the 1st of May, 1811, to the 30th of April, 1812, was 53,037 Areot rupees, of which 52,521 was\nfrom places beyond the territories of the Madras government, viz.\n\n| From Calcutta | - - - | 20,862 |\n| Ceylon        | - - - | 1,104  |\n| the Maldives  | - - - | 20,177 |\n| Various places| - - - | 10,378 |\n\nArcot rupees 52,521\n\nDuring the above period the total value of the exports from Vizagapatam was 1,348,872 rupees, of which only 75,773 was to places beyond the territories of the Madras government, viz.\n\n| To Calcutta | - - - | 38,584 |\n| Mancepatam  | - - - | 1,235  |\n| London      | - - - | 26,497 |\n| Maldives    | - - - | 7,719  |\n| Various places| - - - | 1,738 |\n\nArcot rupees 75,773\n\nBetween the dates above-mentioned, 233 vessels and craft, measuring 25,740 tons, arrived; and 305 vessels, measuring 33,847 tons, departed. A considerable quantity of cloth is manufactured in the adjacent country, and the inhabitants of the town are very expert in carving curious little boxes of ivory and bone.\n\nIn A.D. 1689, in the reign of Aurengzebe, during a rupture between that monarch and the English, their warehouses here were seized, and all the residents of that nation put to death. In 1757 it was taken by M. Bussy. Along with the rest of the province, it was acquired by the British in 1765, under the administration of Lord Clive, and it now forms one of the five districts into which the Northern Circars were divided in 1803, when the Bengal revenue and judicial system were introduced.\n\nTravelling distance from Madras, 483 miles; from Nagpoor, 394; from Hyderabad, 355; and from Calcutta, 557 miles. (Parliamentary Reports, Orme, Johnson, &c.)\n\nVIZIANAGUR, (Vijayanagara.)\u2014A town in the Northern Circars, 37 miles W. from Ganjam. Lat. 19\u00b0. 21'. N. Long. 84\u00b0. 43'. E.\n\nVOLCONDA.\u2014A town in the Carnatic province, 77 miles S.W. from Pondicherry. Lat. 11\u00b0. 19'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 5'. E. During the Carnatic wars of the last century this was a strong post, its principal defence being a rock 200 feet high, and about a mile in circumference at the bottom.\n\nWADJO, (Wajn).\u2014A state or confederacy in the Island of Celebes, situated to the north of the Buggess territories, named Boni.\n\nIn 1775 this country was governed by 40 regents, among whom women were admitted, as well as men. From these two chiefs were selected, one for warlike affairs, styled Patara, and the other for the civil administration, named Padenrang. In addition to these was the mattowra, or elected king, who acted as president of the whole, forming altogether a very complex sort of government. At that date the Wadjoos were rich, commercial, and nearly independent of the influence of the Dutch, for which they were in part indebted to the natural strength of their country. (Stavo-rinus, &c.)\n\nWAGEEOO.\u2014One of the Papuan islands, situated about the 131st degree of east longitude, and within the first degree of south latitude. In length it may be estimated at 90 miles, by 22 the average breadth.\n\nOn the north coast of this island is a harbour, formed by the Island of Rawak, on which grows the ambong tree, the heart of which is an excellent cabbage; and here sago cakes, baked hard, are to be purchased in large quantities, as are also fish and turtle. To the latter the Malays of the Eastern Isles\nhave, in general, an antipathy. There are no goats or fowls here.\n\nOn the north-west coast of Wageeoo there is another harbour, named Piapis, situated in Lat. 6\u00b0. 5'. S. Long. 130\u00b0. 15'. E. It is formed by two capacious bays, where there is fresh water, and plenty of tall timber fit for masts. In both bays there are good mud soundings, and on a small island, named Sisipa, is a pond of fresh water, with sago trees growing close to it; the ambong or cabbage tree also abounds. Along the northern coast, generally, water is to be procured from rivers, or stagnate pools, not far from the shore. The gigantic Kinna cockle is found in plenty among the coral reefs, and makes an excellent stew with the heart of the cabbage tree.\n\nOn the west side of Wageeoo is a deep bay, before which lie many small low islands, mostly covered with trees. The largest of these is not above a mile and a half in circumference, and there are some not half a mile. These islets produce the sugar cane, from which the inhabitants express the juice. The Mahommedans subsist in a great measure on fish and sago bread, and also eat the biche de mar, which is likewise a food of the native Papuas. This is eaten raw, cut up in small pieces, and mixed with salt and lime juice. The natives say, that in the centre of the country there is a large lake, containing many islands, but it is more probably a bay, which deeply indents the coast. The hills here are of sufficient height to attract the clouds, and cause the descent of a considerable quantity of rain.\n\nThis island is well inhabited; on the sea-coast by Mahommedans, and in the interior by the aborigines, who are mostly mop-headed Papuas. In all the harbours the Malay tongue is spoken and understood. A French voyager asserts, that, in 1792, the inhabitants of Wageeoo had declared war against the Dutch, and joined with the inhabitants of Ceylon in an attack on Amboyna. (Forest, Labillardiere, &c.)\n\nWagnagur.\u2014A town possessed by independent native chiefs on the sea-coast of the Gujarat Peninsula. Lat. 21\u00b0. 3'. N. Long. 71\u00b0. 58'. E.\n\nWalluburg.\u2014A hill fort in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Bejapoor, near Chuckowrie, in the Darwar district. This place was long held under the Peshwa by Purseram Bhow, and when he was defeated and slain, it was seized by the Colapoore Rajah, in whose possession it remained until 1804, when, by the interposition of the British, it was restored to the Peshwa, and is now held by one of his feudatories. (MSS. &c.)\n\nWain, (or Wye).\u2014A town in the Maharatta territories, in the province of Bejapoor, about 50 miles southward from Poonah.\n\nThis is the capital and chief residence of the rich and powerful Maharatta Brahmin family, named Rastia, which is nearly related to the Peshwa. It is also one of the towns which enjoy the privilege, remarkable in the Maharatta dominions, of killing beef for sale. (Moor, &c. &c.)\n\nWaluru.\u2014A town in the Mysore Rajah's territories, situated in the neighbourhood of Bangaloor.\n\nThis place contains above 500 houses, and is one of the richest and best built on this frontier above the Ghauts; but it is badly supplied with water. It consists of a castle, of a fort and town, and of a pettah or suburb. The chief manufacture here is cotton cloth, which the inhabitants can afford to sell very cheap. In the adjacent country many coarse blankets are woven, from the wool which their flocks produce. The sheep are shorn twice every year; once in the cold, and once in the rainy season; and 12 sheep furnish sufficient wool to make a blanket six cubits long, and three wide. Here also are distilleries of country rum, in which the bark of the Minosa is an ingredient. Their mode of con-\ndensing the liquor is very rude, and the liquor, never being rectified by a second distillation, is execrable. At the weekly fair, which is held here, the principal articles exposed for sale are provisions, coarse cotton cloths, blankets, and iron work for agricultural uses. It is only in the larger towns of the Mysore that weekly fairs are held, and there are not any of the small markets called hants in Bengal, where the natives waste so much time.\n\nThe soil of some of the gardens here is remarkably deep, as, where wells have been dug, it exceeds 20 feet in thickness. A gardener is in this place a separate profession from that of a farmer, and is considered of inferior rank. In ploughing both oxen and buffaloes are yoked, and the manner of working resembles that customary in Bengal. The castle here is occupied by a Rajpoot and his family, whose ancestors were formerly Jaghireddars of the place and neighbouring villages. By the Mysore Rajah's government he is allowed 400 pagoda's annually, with permission to reside in the castle. (F. Buchunan, &c.)\n\nWANDICOTTA, (or Gandicotta).\u2014A large district in the Balaghaut ceded territories, situated principally between the 14th and 15th degrees of north latitude, and now mostly comprehended in the Cudapah collectorship. The chief towns are Wandicotta, Tadimery, and Anantapooram; and the principal river the Pennar.\n\nWANDICOTTA.\u2014A town in the Balaghaut ceded territories, 50 miles N. N.W. from Cudapah. Lat. 14\u00b0. 44'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 20'. E. This place was formerly remarkable as a strong fortress, and for the vicinity of a diamond mine. (Rennell, &c.)\n\nWANDIPOOR.\u2014A town in the province of Bootan, in the territories of the Deb Rajah. Lat. 27\u00b0. 50'. N. Long. 89\u00b0. 50'. E.\n\nThis place lies about 24 miles from Tassisudon in an easterly direction, and is esteemed by the Bootees a place of great strength. It is situated on the narrow extremity of a rock between the Matchieu, the Patchieu, and the Tehanchieu rivers, whose streams unite at its sharpened point, and form a river of considerable magnitude, which takes the name of Chauncheen, and flows along the flat surface of the Bijnee district into the Brahmapootra. At this place there is a bridge of turpentine fir of 112 feet span, without the least iron in its construction, yet it is said to have lasted 150 years, without exhibiting any symptoms of decay. Owing to its situation Wandi poor appears agitated by a perpetual hurricane. This is one of the consecrated towns of Bootan, where a considerable number of Gy-longos, or monks, are established. (Turner, &c.)\n\nWANDIWASH.\u2014A town in the Carnatic province, 64 miles S. W. from Madras. Lat. 12\u00b0. 29'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 40'. E.\n\nIn September, 1759, the British troops, in an attack on this place, were repulsed with great slaughter; but in the November following it was taken by Colonel Coote with scarcely any loss. In January, 1760, a decisive battle was here fought between the French army under M. Lally, and the British commanded by Colonel Coote, in which the former were totally defeated, and never after made a stand. This action was wholly fought by the Europeans of the two armies, while the sepoys looked on; and after it was over, the sepoy commandants, complimenting Colonel Coote on the victory, thanked him for the sight of such a battle as they had never before witnessed. With the surrounding district Wandiwash is now comprehended in the southern division of the Arcot collectorship. (Orme, &c.)\n\nWANKANEER.\u2014A town possessed by an independent native chief in the Gujrat peninsula. Lat. 22\u00b0. 27'. N. Long. 76\u00b0. 55'. E.\n\nThis place stands on an angle\nformed by the conflux of the River Muchoo, with an inferior stream named Patallia. It is long and narrow, and surrounded by a great wall with towers and bastions, comprehending about 5000 houses, with a good bazar. A pious Mahommedan sheikh has here erected an elegant mosque, but unfortunately the sacred recess for prayer is not due west (looking towards Mecca), and the whole is consequently useless. The town lies so directly under a range of lofty mountains, that it is entirely commanded.\n\nDuring the rains the Patallia inundates the town; but in the dry season it diminishes to a slender stream in a low bed, from which circumstance its name is derived, Patala signifying the infernal regions. (Macmurdo, &c.)\n\nWARANGOL.\u2014An ancient city in the Nizam's territories, in the province of Hyderabad, 50 miles N. E. from the city of Hyderabad. Lat. 17\u00b0 5' N. Long. 79\u00b0 3' E.\n\nThis place was founded about A.D. 1067, at which period it is supposed to have been the metropolis of Andray, or Telengana. In 1309 Allah ud Deen, the Delhi sovereign, dispatched an army against it by the route of Bengal, without success; but it was taken from the Hindoos in 1324 by Aligh Khan. It however again reverted to that ancient nation, and in 1421 its rajah was slain in battle, and the place captured by Khan Azim Khan, the general of Ahmed Shah Bhamenee, the Sultan of the Deccan. By different authors this name is written Woragulla, Warankul, and Arenkil. (Scott, Ferishta, Wilks, &c.)\n\nWARRIOR.\u2014A town in the Carnatic province, 38 miles N. E. from Tanjore. Lat. 11\u00b0 15' N. Long. 79\u00b0 25' E.\n\nWARYE.\u2014A town in the province of Gujrat, district of Werrear, 14 miles S.W. from Rahdunpoor.\n\nThis is an open town, protected only by a ditch, which, in many places, is filled up with thorns and rubbish; yet it is the residence of many of the head Jhuts, who do not possess any forts, except that of Amrapoor, which stands on the Run, to the S.W. of Warye. This place from its vicinity to the Run and to Wagar, is in some measure influenced by the events that occur in Cutch. In 1808 Warye was plundered by a Cutch army, conducted across the Run by the zemindars of Wagar, on which occasion the Jhuts were compelled to seek shelter in Amrapoor and the Melwas. The thieves of Wagar and the Jhuts are engaged in constant broils, but the first are the most powerful.\n\nThe town of Warye can muster from 800 to 1000 Jhut horsemen, well mounted, and principally armed with spears and sabres. These carry their plundering excursions through the greater part of Cotiwar, the whole of the Burrungannah pergunnah, and not unfrequently into Cutch. Their subjection to the Nabob of Rahdunpoor is merely nominal, as they obey or decline his summons according to the temporary current of their inclination. (Macmurdo, &c.)\n\nWASSAH.\u2014A town in the province of Gujrat, 18 miles N. by E. from Cambay. Lat. 22\u00b0 39' N. Long. 73\u00b0 52' E.\n\nWAUFORN.\u2014A village in the Maharatta territories, 24 miles north from Poonah, from whence the Holcar family originated.\n\nWAWUL.\u2014A village in the province of Gujrat, district of Werrear, situated a few miles to the S.E. of Rahdunpoor.\n\nThis place contains about 300 houses, and stands on the banks of the River Sereswati, a small stream of salt water, which during the rains overflows its banks, but at other seasons is everywhere fordable.\n\nWEER.\u2014A small district in the province of Cashmere, extending along the south side of the Jellum or Collumah River, which is here about 80 yards across.\n\nWERAD.\u2014A town in the Maha-\nratta territories, in the province of Bejapoor, 63 miles S. S. W. from Poonah. Lat. 17\u00b0. 39'. N. Long. 73\u00b0. 48'. E.\n\n**Werrear, (Wuddyar).**\u2014A district on the N.W. frontier of the province of Gujrat, extending along the banks of the Banass River. The country lying between Rahdunpoor and Patree on the north and south, and from Becharjee to the banks of the Run, is called Wuddyar or Wurryar; for which name the inhabitants say it is indebted to the excellent quality of its grass, it being resorted to by immense herds of cattle sent to pasture on the banks of the Run. Wuddyar, or Wandyar, in the Gujrattee language, signifies a herdsman, by which class the banks of the Run were originally inhabited.\n\nThroughout the whole of Werrear fowls and sheep are cheap and abundant; the price of the former being five for a rupee, and the latter half a rupee each; but goats are a greater rarity. It also produces a number of horses of a smaller breed than those of Cottiwar; but horses of a good quality being in great demand, few are exported, and those principally to the Jondpoor territories.\n\nThis district is much infested by plundering Cooloes, the principal dens of these robbers being at Warye, 14 miles S.W. from Rahdunpoor; Barbere, 24 miles north, (belonging to the Cooloes); and Therwara, 30 miles N. W. from Rahdunpoor; the latter possessed by the Balooches. *(Macnurdo, &c.)*\n\n**Wetter Isle.**\u2014An island in the Eastern Seas, situated off the north coast of Timor about the eighth degree of south latitude, the interior of which has not yet been explored. In length it may be estimated at 65 miles, by 20 the average breadth.\n\n**Wolajanagur.**\u2014A large town in the Carnatic Province, situated on the north side of the Palar River, about two miles from Arcot. Lat. 12\u00b0. 55'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 30'. E.\n\nThis town was built by the Nabob of Arcot, Mahommed Ali Walajah, and named after himself. To people it the inhabitants were removed from Lalpetlah and other places, which with Mahommedan princes in Hindostan is a common practice. It soon after had the misfortune to fall into the hands of Hyder, who did not spare it; but, on the restoration of peace, it was again fostered by the nabob. At present it has attained a great size, is regularly built, rich, and populous, with an ample supply of provisions, which are cheap and abundant. Its fortifications are mouldering to decay; but, as the place has not now any enemy to apprehend, the loss is of little consequence. Almost the whole of the trade between the country above the Eastern Ghauts and the sea centres here; and it is said a larger assortment of goods can be procured at this place than in any town to the south of the Krishna, Madras not excepted. *(F. Buchanan, &c.)*\n\n**Wombinellore.**\u2014A town in the south of India, district of Salem, 102 miles S. E. from Seringapatam. Lat. 11\u00b0. 44'. N. Long. 78\u00b0. 10'. E.\n\n**Wow.**\u2014A fortified town in the district of Neyer, situated about 10 miles west from Theraud, on the north-west boundary of the Gujrat Province.\n\nThis town is much more populous than Theraud, and may be considered as the capital of Neyer. At present it contains not fewer than 1000 Rajpoot families of rank, and merchants of wealth and credit. Formerly the whole tract of country as far as Theraud on the east, Gurrath and Rardra on the west, Songaum and the Run on the south, and Sanjore on the north, were subject to Raney of Wow, a Chowan Rajpoot. *(Macnurdo, &c.)*\n\n**Wowamia.**\u2014A small fishing town in the Gujrat Peninsula, about six miles distant from the fortress of Mallia. This place stands on the Run, and here there is a ferry established for transporting passengers to the Cutch shore. It forms a small\nindependency, the estate of a petty Cotiwar chief. (Macmurdo, &c.)\n\nWudwan.\u2014A town in the province of Gujrat, district of Chalawara. Lat. 22\u00b0 29'. N. Long. 71\u00b0 37'. E.\n\nThis is a town of considerable extent and population, being about the size of Sylah, and possessing a fort of considerable strength, almost new. It belongs to a Rajpoot family, celebrated for their skill and bravery in predatory warfare, and was in 1805 for two months, without success, besieged by the Guicowar's army.\n\nGhee, hemp, and leather, are brought to this place from Puttenwara in waggons, and carried from hence to Bhownagur on the Gulf of Cambay, from whence they are exported. These caravans require an escort of from 20 to 50 matchlockmen, who are paid at the rate of one-fourth of a rupee for 30 miles distance. It is customary at the villages in this quarter to place a man on the top of a high tree; and when he perceives horsemen, he waves a flag and sounds a large rattle, after which the village drums beat to arms, and the combatants assemble at their respective posts. (Macmurdo, &c.)\n\nWurda River, (Varada, granting Prayers).\u2014This river has its source in the Injardy Hills, two miles north of the Barooolypass, in the province of Berar, from whence it flows in a S. E. direction; and, after a course of about 200 miles, including the windings, falls into the Godavery. Since the 25th of December, 1803, its channel marks the boundary which separates the Nizam's territories from those of the Nagpoor Maharattas.\n\nWurgaum.\u2014A village in the province of Gujrat, district of Chalawara, situated about five miles N. N. E. from Dussara.\n\nThe surrounding territory is a rich, level country, amply supplied with tanks of good water, and is remarkable for the abundant crops it produces of wheat and grain. The soil is a rich black earth, yet light and sandy.\n\nIn this quarter of Gujrat the Hindoo places of worship are much more rude in their structure than those of the southward. Many of these, dedicated to Mahadeva and Bhavani, consist merely of a room built of stone, and five feet square, having a triangular roof, and covered with a strong coat of lime. On each face of the triangle is carved a savage representation of the human countenance. (Macmurdo, &c.)\n\nWynad, (Bynadu).\u2014A small district in the south of India, situated on the summit of the Western Ghauts, about the 12th degree of north latitude, and at present comprehended in the Malabar collectorship.\n\nBynadu signifies the open country, but does not seem quite applicable, as, although situated on the top of the mountains, it is in many places overrun with forests, and of difficult access. This district is also named Nellcala and Wynatil, and produces the best cardamoms in India. Carulu Verna, the present rajah, is sprung from a younger branch of the family, and retains considerable power within his own limits.\n\n---\n\nX.\n\nXulla Isles.\u2014Three islands of considerable size in the Eastern Seas, situated to the S. E. of the Molucca Passage, and as yet but little explored. They are occasionally invaded by the Papuas from New Guinea, although the distance is almost 300 miles. About 40 years ago the Dutch had a factory on the Xulla Bessey Isle, in a redoubt garrisoned by a sergeant and 25 men. It was prior to that period annexed to the government of Amboyna, but was afterwards transferred to that of Ternate. (Bougainville, &c.)\nY.\n\nYauly.\u2014A town in the province of Berar, 90 miles S. W. from Nagpoor. Lat. 20\u00b0. 25'. N. Long. 79\u00b0. 1'. E.\n\nYaynangheoum.\u2014A town in the Birman dominions, situated on the east side of the Irawardy. Lat. 20\u00b0. 28'. N. Long. 94\u00b0. 35'. E.\n\nFive miles east of this place are the celebrated petroleum wells, which supply the whole of the Birman empire, and many parts of India with this useful production. The town is chiefly inhabited by potters, who carry on an extensive manufacture of earthen ware.\n\nThere are here a great many oil pits within a small compass, the aperture being generally about four feet square, and lined with timber. The oil is drawn up in an iron pot, fastened to a rope passed over a wooden cylinder, which revolves on an axis supported by two upright posts. When the pot is filled, two men take the rope, and run down a declivity; the pot is afterwards emptied into a cistern, and the water drawn off by a hole at the bottom. The depth of the pits is about 37 fathoms, so that the quantity they contain cannot be seen. When a well is exhausted, they restore the spring by cutting deeper into the rock, which is extremely hard. The Birman government farms out the ground that supplies the oil, and it is again subject to adventurers, who dig the wells at their own hazard. The commodity is sold very cheap on the spot, the principal expense being the transportation charges, and the cost of the earthen pots to hold it. (Symes, &c. &c.)\n\nYelcundul.\u2014A large district in the Nizam's territories, in the province of Hyderabad, situated between the 18th and 19th degrees of north latitude, and bounded on the north by the Godavery River. The chief towns are Elgandel and Ramergl.\n\nYellapura.\u2014A small town above the Western Ghaut Mountains, in the Soonda district, and included in the collectorship of North Canara. Lat. 14\u00b0. 57'. N. Long. 74\u00b0. 55'. E.\n\nThis place contains about 100 houses, with a market. In the country east from this towards Hullyhalla, Sambrang, Madanaru, Mundagodu, and Induru, the woods consist mostly of teak, and almost all the forests in this neighbourhood spontaneously produce pepper. Although the rains in this elevated quarter are not so heavy as below the Ghaus, yet they are sufficient to bring one crop of rice to maturity on level ground. (F. Buchanam, &c. &c.)\n\nYligan.\u2014A small Spanish redoubt and garrison, situated on a bay of the same name, on the north coast of Magindanao.\n\nYowl Isles.\u2014A cluster of very small islands lying off the north coast of the Island of Wagecoo, surrounded by coral reefs, and situated about the 131st degree of east longitude.\n\nYunshan.\u2014An extensive inland region of India beyond the Ganges, situated about the 20th degree of north latitude, and included by the Birmans in the list of their territories. It is intersected by many rivers flowing from the north; but it does not appear ever to have been explored, even by the Birmans.\n\nZ.\n\nZebu Isle.\u2014One of the Philippines, situated about the 123d and 124th degrees of east longitude. In length it may be estimated at 108 miles by 24 the average breadth.\n\nMagellan arrived at this island in A. D. 1521, and was received by the inhabitants with such kindness, that their king, Hannabar, his whole family, with the chief of Dimasaya (another island), and many of his subjects, were baptized. The chief\nof Maetan, a very small island lying off the town of Zebu, alone resisted the Spaniards, and defied Magellan, who unfortunately accepted the challenge. For the enterprise he selected 50 Spaniards, who attacked the Indians in morasses, the water up to their breasts, and approached so near, that Magellan was wounded by an arrow, and died in the field with six Spaniards; the rest saved themselves by flight.
