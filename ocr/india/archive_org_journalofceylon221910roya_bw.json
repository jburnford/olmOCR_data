PERERA,\n\nBarrister-at-Law of the Middle Temple and Advocate of the Supreme Court of Ceylon.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nThe principal authorities for the period comprising the reign of Sr\u00ed Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu VI. are Valentyn and De Couto\u2019s accounts of Sinhalese history and the R\u00e1j\u00e1valiya. In certain parts De Couto\u2019s version, compiled in 1550 from Sinhalese records, now destroyed, appears to be more reliable and complete than the R\u00e1j\u00e1valiya narrative. Valentyn, who also derived his information from Sinhalese sources, probably from a variant text of the R\u00e1j\u00e1valiya which is no longer in existence, supplements in certain particulars the facts noted in the Sinhalese chronicle.\n\nThe R\u00e1j\u00e1valiya account dealing with the period under review appears to be a bare summary of events of reigns compiled from State records, and to have been put together about the later end of the sixteenth or the early half of the seventeenth century. Errors of scribes, omissions, and the disarrangement of the narrative prevent us from entirely trusting the record. However, a careful comparison of the R\u00e1j\u00e1valiya with the accounts of Valentyn and De Couto enable us to gain a correct knowledge of the principal events of the reign of Sr\u00ed Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu VI. and of the time shortly before and after. But for the details of the picture, for information regarding the state and character of the king, the condition of the country, the progress of education, the form of administration, the social habits, and the material advance of the people, one has to go to the literature of the period. It was an age of deep literary activity, and fortunately much of that literature has descended to us, giving us a glimpse of pure Sinhalese manners and culture shortly before they came under Portuguese influences.\nOf these contemporary works, one of the most important from the historical point of view is the *Perakumb\u00e1sirita*, ascribed to the priest \u015ar\u012b R\u00e1hula. It is a poetical panegyric of \u015ar\u012b Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu, containing details of his ancestry and celebrating the victories and magnificence of his reign. A series of poems called *sand\u00e9\u1e63a*, or poetical epistles, composed during this epoch, contain references to passing historical events, and furnish a complete picture of the contemporary life of the period. A synopsis of the argument of the *sand\u00e9\u1e63a* poems would afford one an idea of the general character of these compositions. The Sinhalese *sand\u00e9\u1e63a* poem, based on the model of K\u00e1lid\u00e1sa\u2019s *M\u00e9ghad\u00fata*, the \u201ccloud-messenger,\u201d embodies, as its name implies, a message to be conveyed by some bird to the shrine of a god, invoking his blessing either on the sovereign or on a member of the royal family, or imploring the aid of the divinity for the triumph of the imperial arms. The poem generally opens with an apostrophe to the particular bird to whom the \u201cmessage\u201d is to be entrusted, next the capital whence he starts is described, and the bird bidden to worship the Tooth-relic and take leave of the king before setting forth. This affords the poet an opportunity to describe the fortifications, the streets, the temple of the Tooth, and other sacred and secular buildings of the city, and to sing the splendour of the court and the glories of the king. Next follows an account of the chief villages and towns, the principal landmarks and natural features of the country, such as temples, shrines, hospices, fortified posts, tanks, mountains, forests, and streams along the route by which the carrier bird has to fly. From these descriptions, though poetical, and in places highly coloured, a discriminating reader may glean many interesting particulars regarding the state of the Island and the condition of the people. Finally, the city whither the bird is bound and the shrine of the god to whom the message is despatched is singled out for praise. The *sand\u00e9\u1e63a* closes with the words of the \u201crequest\u201d to be breathed into the ear of the divinity, and a prayer for the prosperity of the realm and victory for the king. The majority of these *sand\u00e9\u1e63as* were written during this epoch, and, as stated before, furnish valuable data for a\nsocial study of the period. Almost all the principal highways and cities of the time traversed by these winged messengers are described. The S\u0113lalihini Sand\u0113sa, \"the s\u0113la message,\" written circa 1450 by the priest \u015ar\u012b R\u0101hula, describes the route between K\u014dtt\u0113 and Ke\u1e37aniya. The distance being short, the bird is made to take a circuitous course, by way of Gurub\u0113bila (Hanv\u0113lla) on to Ke\u1e37aniya, to enable the poet to describe the intervening country.\u00b9 The Paravi Sand\u0113sa, \"dove message,\" by the same author, describes the route between K\u014dtt\u0113 and Dondra, the dove-messenger flying along the seabeach road now traversed by the railway from Colombo to M\u00e1tara. The Gir\u0101 Sand\u0113sa, the \"parrot-message,\" by an unknown poet, is a very valuable poem, teeming with allusions to contemporary events and manners, and describes the route from K\u014dtt\u0113 to Totagamuva and the educational establishment Vijaya B\u0101hu Pirivena of \u015ar\u012b R\u0101hula. The Havsa, or Tisara Sand\u0113sa, ascribed to the High Priest V\u012bd\u0101gama Maitreya, conveys a message by a \"swan\" from the capital to the Buddhist hierarch Vanaratana M\u0101has\u0101mi, then presiding over the ecclesiastical college of Padm\u0101vati Pirivena at K\u0113ragala. This work illustrates in detail the aspect of the capital, and contains a vivid presentation of the royal durbar with the different ranks of officials who stood before the throne. There is yet another Tisara Sand\u0113sa belonging to the same period by a different hand, which unfortunately I could not consult, the poem not being printed, and no manuscript being available to me for reference.\n\nThe Kovil Sand\u0113sa,\u00b2 \"the cuckoo (koil) message,\" apart from its literary excellence, has great value from a historical point of view. It was composed by the priestly warden of the Irugalkula Pirivena at Mulgirigala in the Southern Province, and invokes a blessing on Sapumalkum\u0101ra, who was then administering Jaffna as prince regent, soon after the conquest, and contains a contemporary picture of the capital city of Jaffna and its environs. The poems of \u015ar\u012b R\u0101hula glow with an intense patriotism and affection for the royal family, and even in the K\u0101vyas\u0113khara, which deals with a birth tale of the Buddha, there are scattered allusions to the ancestry, virtues,\n\n\u00b9 But vide Appendix B.  \n\u00b2 Still unpublished.\nand accomplishments of the king and the princess royal Ulakundali-d\u00e9vi,\\(^1\\) at whose request the poem was undertaken.\n\nThe glossaries, two of which were compiled during this reign, *Piyummala*, *Ruvanmala*, and the *N\u00e1m\u00e1valiya*, furnish information, though not so ample as might be wished for, of the character of the public and domestic architecture, of the articles and utensils in ordinary use, of games and pastimes, and of the grades of society. The ampest and most accurate of these is the poetical glossary of the *Ruvanmala*, composed by the king on the model of the *Amarasi\u1e45ha*. The *Piyummala* is an older collection of words on the basis of the *Abhid\u00e1nappad\u00edpik\u00e1*. The *N\u00e1m\u00e1valiya* is a poetical composition by the chieftain Nall\u00farutun, *sannas* minister, made in 1411, earlier than the *Ruvanmala*, and not so complete.\n\nA prose work, the Sinhalese *Th\u00fapavansa*, probably written by an author of this period, furnishes us with a detailed description of the ancient Sinhalese royal dress and ornaments, and the ordinary attire and furniture in use in the country, though treating of the history of an earlier time. However, as manners and customs change so very little in the East its date scarcely affects its value. In addition to the sources already indicated, a series of stone inscriptions and copperplate grants (*sannas*) have preserved to us a wealth of personal and administrative detail of great historical importance. I have specified in an appendix\\(^2\\) all the lithic and copperplate records bearing on this reign, noting the references where they may be found. Three grants which have yet to be accurately copied, translated, and annotated, I have included in an appendix\\(^2\\) with a tentative translation. For the text I had to depend on transcripts more or less imperfect. There is yet another stone record, I am informed, inscribed during this reign, which is hewn on the rock at the Galap\u00e1ta Vih\u00e1ra in the Kalutara District. Unfortunately I have not been able to secure a copy of it. Perhaps the most interesting of the series is the Pepily\u00e1na inscription, which contains rules regulating\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This form of the name, instead of Ulaku\u1e0da D\u00e9vi, occurs in the *Kovul Sand\u00e9sa*.\n\n\\(^2\\) These I have deferred for a later chapter.\nthe internal economy of a great ecclesiastical establishment of the period, with directions regarding the lodging and entertainment of wandering monks and scholars. Similarly, the Uggalboda D\u00e9v\u00e1l\u00e9 sannas furnish information regarding the public duties imposed on great chieftains and the character of the honours accorded to them by royal decree.\n\nThus, the main sources for the history of the period in review are (1) the historical accounts of De Couto, Valentyn, and the R\u00e1j\u00e1valiya; (2) passages in Sinhalese contemporary literature; (3) Chinese annals relating to the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries; (4) the testimony of royal grants and stone inscriptions. Besides these, much assistance might have been ordinarily derived from archaeology and tradition, those twin hand-maidens of historical investigation. But, as unfortunately the capital of the period and the adjoining districts had long been a prey to Portuguese invasion and fanatical vandalism, scarce anything in the nature of ancient monuments has survived. Besides, the sea-board districts, both in ancient as in modern times, being the most subject to foreign influences, much of the ancient traditional lore has disappeared, though a few legends still linger in the remoter villages.\n\nIt has been found to be convenient to arrange the subject in four divisions. In the first an attempt has been made to trace the political events of the reign, preserving as much as possible with the imperfect data available the chronological sequence of events. In the second has been sketched the territorial and political divisions, the organization and administration of village communities, and of the provincial governments; and the constitution of the realm in the fifteenth century has been outlined, so far as may be gathered from the meagre materials available. This chapter will be merely tentative, in view of the dearth of written information on the subject. The present, so far as the writer is aware, is the first attempt to collect that information into a connected shape. The third part has been devoted to the social condition of the country, the food, attire, mode of living of the people, games and festivals, instruments and tools, the disposition and appointments of the court, and their public and private buildings, weapons and fortifications, and arts and handicrafts, so\nfar as they throw light on the state of Society at the time. My remarks as to the tentative character of the undertaking apply equally to this branch of the subject. It must be noted, however, that materials though scattered are more abundant for a social survey than for a sketch of the constitution. Under a fourth head is included an account of the literature of the period. It was an age of general culture, as it was of successful military achievement, and many of the productions of that time have descended to us. Unfortunately some of these works, though it must be confessed only a few, have still to be published. Greater attention has been directed to the consideration of the life and character of the men themselves who created the era rather than to an elaborate critical analysis of their work. The estimate of their work falls more to the province of the critical scholar than to the historical student. Besides, some account of their productions is available, while no account of the lives of the brilliant band of scholars who lent lustre to the time has yet been attempted. This method has commended itself as the best calculated to understand their work and the prevailing spirit of the age.\n\n\u015ar\u012b Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu VI. was the last great monarch of a single Lank\u00e1, and his reign marks an epoch. A careful consideration of his times enables us to judge how far the Sinhalese had declined since the great days of Anur\u00e1dhapura and Polonnaruva, what was the nature and degree of the culture they possessed when the Portuguese landed in Ceylon, and to what extent their customs and institutions have been modified or superseded by the adoption of foreign ideals and the impact of European civilizations.\n\nI.\u20141412\u20131467 A.D.\u00b9\n\n\u015airi Sangabo \u015ar\u012b Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu VI. came to the throne under tragic circumstances.

Probably \u015ar\u012b Par\u0101krama B\u0101lu was the adopted son and heir of his maternal grandfather, Dambadeni Bandar Par\u0101krama B\u0101hu, an under-king who wielded supreme power at K\u014dtt\u00e9 on the death of his son-in-law Vijaya B\u0101hu (cf. Lee\u2019s Ribeiro, p. 24). Saddharmaratn\u0101kara, in a passage the sense of which is rendered obscure by its compression, states that V\u012bra Alak\u0113\u015bvara was taken captive by the Chinese. It would thus follow from Couto and the Saddharmaratn\u0101kara that Sevulu Vijaya B\u0101hu was probably at K\u014dtt\u00e9 while his brother V\u012bra B\u0101hu was ruling in Gampola, and on the former\u2019s death his father-in-law, Par\u0101krama B\u0101hu of the Giriva\u1e47\u1e0da, probably became king of K\u014dtt\u00e9, till he was captured by the Chinese through the perfidy of his clansman Alak\u0113\u015bvara. But no definite conclusion can be come to till all the Chinese literature on the subject is available for reference.\u2014Journ., R.A.S.

Legend has cast a halo round the youth of \u015ar\u012b Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu, telling how, hunted from retreat to retreat by the emissaries of the tyrant, like many another hero of antiquity, his life was miraculously spared by the loyalty of humble herdsmen and peasants. Ultimately the prince, then styled \u015ar\u012b Ep\u00e1no, took refuge in the monastery at Rayigama, where the priest Vid\u00e1gama Mah\u00e1 S\u00e1mi of the blood royal befriended the youth, formed a conspiracy to assassinate Alak\u00e9svara, and placed him on the throne.\n\nThe prince would appear to have been sixteen years of age when he slew Alak\u00e9svara. This event took place about the year 1411. After this tragedy \u015ar\u012b Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu seems to have returned to Rayigama, where he continued for three years. In 1415 he removed his seat to K\u00f3tt\u00e9, and in the same year was duly anointed king. Hence arises the confusion of two distinct dates found in contemporary records of the accession of this monarch. Some date his reign from the actual year he acceded, others from the year he was formally installed. He embellished the capital with fine stone buildings, palaces, and a range of monasteries, opened up streets, and fortified the citadel with a girdle of ramparts.\n\nValentyn, probably following a more complete version of the R\u00e1j\u00e1valiya, records: \"Thereupon, having been crowned (which period is described as having been 1,958 years after the death of Budun, or 1,415 years after the birth of Christ), he remained three years at Reygamme (Rayigama), then removed to Cotta (K\u00f3tt\u00e9), then built a fine city entirely of solid blue\n\n---\n\n1 Sk. \u00c1dhip\u00e1da, \"Arch-duke,\" title of the Sinhalese Crown prince.\n2 R\u00e1j\u00e1valiya, p. 68; De Couto, Journ., R.A.S.

The magnificence of the building has been sung by the bards who flourished at the capital; among them by \u015ar\u012b R\u0101hula in his S\u0113lalihini Sand\u0113sa:\n\n\"Departing straight into the palace where\nOf moonstone built stand the long lines of walls,\nWhere waving in the wind smooth strings of pearls\nHang from the palace eaves where glitter gems\nShining upon the solid golden spire.\"\u00b9\n\n\"Thence in a trice repair to the royal bower which stands with rows of mighty walls wrought of moonstone (crystal), where\n\non the ground hallowed by an anchorite's hermitage, which determined the S\u0101kyas' choice of Kapilavastu as the site of their future city, according to the old Buddhist legend.

Later, the legend was again introduced by the annalists to account for the choice of Senkadagala Nuvara (Kandy) as the capital.\n\nTravels by De Marignolli, p. 369, contains the following reference to K\u014dtt\u00e9:\u2014\"If we suppose he (i.e., Cain) built his city after the murder of Abel......this city of his is thought to have been where now is that called Kota, Ceyllan, a place where I have been.\" Note (by Burnell):\u2014\n\"Kotta, or (Buddhist-classically) Jayawardhanapura, near Colombo, is first mentioned as a royal residence about 1314, but it again became the capital of the Island in 1410.....It appears to be represented as such in the great map of Fra Mauro, under the name of Cotte Civitas.\"\n\nMarignolli left Constantinople, May, 1339, passing overland to Pekin .... returning via Zaeton to Quillon in Malabar, December, 1346, or 1347, from which place he sailed about the end of 1348.... and appears to have been accidentally driven by the winds to Ceylon.

Alak\u00e9svara had raised shrines for Vishnu, Lakshmana, and K\u00e1rtik\u00e9ya on the four corners of the city wall,\u00b3 and the king maintained them and perhaps added to them.\n\nStill in two places in the ancient town, called to this day p\u00fana lin, granite columns sunk into the ground mark the spot where the sacred vessel (p\u00fan\u00e1va) of the god had been deposited. One of the most magnificent of these shrines was the Mahasen Mah\u00e1 P\u00e1ya, the great palace of Mahasen, described as having risen on the southern side of the city flashing like \"a blazing orb.\"\u2074 Dedicated to the god of war, the presiding genius of\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 In Ancient Ceylon pinnacles of royal and ecclesiastical edifices were usually wrought of gold or silver and surmounted with precious stones.

The building would appear to have been supported by four detached chapels or shrines in stones at its four angles, dedicated to the four Hindu gods N\u00e1ta, Saman, Vish\u1e47u, and S\u00edva. Hindu influence was very strong at the period, chiefly due to the ascendency of the Alak\u00e9svaras in the Councils of State and the numbers of Brahmins who crowded to court from the neighbouring peninsula. Moreover, the king himself seems to have favoured Hinduism. He possessed a wide knowledge of Sanskr\u0325t, and was probably influenced by the Hindu sacred works he had read, by the Brahmins by whom he was surrounded, and by the teachings of the Royal Tutor \u015ar\u00ed R\u00e1hula, who was deeply skilled in all the lore of the Hindus, and would appear to have entertained liberal notions on the question of religion.

It was an age of great literary activity and educational progress. Ecclesiastical colleges or pirivenas flourished throughout the country and were presided over by abbots, distinguished alike for their knowledge of theology, as for their piety and devotion to the faith: the great Padm\u00e1vati Pirivena at K\u0113ragala, under the presidency of the R\u00e1jaguru Vanaratana Sa\u1e45ghar\u00e1ja, the \u00c1ranyak (\"the woodland cloister\") at Pal\u00e1bhatgala under the rule of the scholarly \u015ar\u00ed Dharmak\u00edrti Sa\u1e45ghar\u00e1ja, the Vijaya B\u00e1hu Pirivena at To\u1e6dagamuva under the control of \u015ar\u00ed R\u00e1hula Sa\u1e45ghar\u00e1ja, the \u015ar\u00ed Gan\u00e1nanda Pirivena at Rayigama under the warden of the Mah\u00e1 N\u00e9tra temple, the High-Priest Maittreya Mah\u00e1 Stav\u00edra, and the Sun\u00e9tra Mah\u00e1 D\u00e9vi Pirivena at Pepiliy\u00e1na under the direction of Tipi\u1e6daka Mangala Sa\u1e45ghar\u00e1ja, the Master of the Tripi\u1e6daka.

According to Chinese records the election of this ruler was confirmed by an edict from Nankin.\\(^1\\) The monarch realized that at this crisis it would not be politic to repudiate the suzerainty of China, which at most was shadowy, and bring on a repetition of the evils which an open flouting of Chinese authority had brought about in the preceding reign. He bided his time till he reorganized the kingdom and consolidated his power to throw off the allegiance to the Dragon throne. The suzerainty involved a yearly tribute,\\(^1\\) which was first paid to the envoys who brought the ratification from China. The second time they came after an interval of five years. Next they came \\textit{circa} 1459,\\(^2\\) but at this period the Sinhalese monarch was at the zenith of his power. The Lord of \"the three-fold Sinhala\" and the overlord of South Indian cities would acknowledge no master, and the Chinese junks sailed away without the tribute.

She was married circa 1449\u20131450 to a prince of the old Sinhalese royal line called Cholca Raya.\u00b9 Having no male offspring of his own, the king was anxious to obtain a grandson of the true line to succeed him on the throne. The king\u2019s wish is reflected in the poetical message contained in \u015ar\u00ed R\u00e1hula\u2019s Selalihini Sand\u00e9\u015ba, invoking the god-king Vibh\u00edsana at Kelaniya, for the blessing of a son for the princess Ulakuda D\u00e9v\u00ed. The prayer was granted, and the birth of the crown prince was celebrated in the capital with all the manifestations of public rejoicing. We catch an echo of the prevalent note of joy in the stanzas of \u015ar\u00ed R\u00e1hula recording the event:\n\nIn the 36th year (of King Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu, i.e., 1451), in the ninth month of the bright moon, when the full moon was seen in the heaven in conjunction with the star (asterism) Aslisa, was born the royal babe wondrously fair, to be a constant source of prosperity to the Solar race.\n\nWith the noise of the thunder of hoofs of steeds galloping (to the tune of) chiming bells hung to them, with the sound of the flapping of chowry-tied ears of lordly tuskers, with the loud blare of pealing, crashing musical instruments (music) and trumpet-shells of victory, like another ocean rose the city\u2019s ceaseless roar.\u00b2\n\nNo Sinhalese prince for the last three centuries had been born with fairer hopes or under brighter auspices, and few met with so untimely and tragic an end.\n\n\u00b9 It is difficult to identify the Sinhalese name in the Portuguese disguise of De Couto, obviously a corruption. According to tradition the husband of Ulakuda D\u00e9v\u00ed was Nall\u00farutun, Sannas Minister, at whose request the Selalihini Sand\u00e9\u015ba, invoking an heir to the princess, was composed.\n\n\u00b2 Selalihini Sand\u00e9\u015ba, vv. 109, 111.\nWhile still a mere youth his grandsire, jealous of preserving the crown in his family, swore him in as heir to the throne and prince-regent (yuva-raja). This action was prompted by a danger which the king\u2019s own generosity had called into being. One Panikkan,\u00b9 an adventurer of royal race from the neighbouring coast of Malabar, found an asylum and a Sinhalese bride at the court of K\u00f3tt\u00e9. He had by her two sons, Champaka Perumal, called by the Sinhalese Sapumal Kum\u00e1ray\u00e1, and Jayav\u00edra, known to the people as Ambulugala Kud\u00e1 Kum\u00e1ray\u00e1,\u00b2 whom \u015ar\u00ed Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu adopted as his sons according to the ancient custom of instituting, probably apprehending, the failure of male issue. Some time after that the empress gave birth to a daughter, the princess Ulaku\u1e0da D\u00e9v\u00ed, mother of Jayav\u00edra.\n\nUltimately, the rivalry between his warlike and ambitious foster sons and his grandson created an element of civil strife in the State, and proved the means of finally extinguishing Par\u00e1krama\u2019s own line on the throne. Fears for the future welfare of the kingdom did not alone occupy the king\u2019s attention. Soon after (circa 1451\u20131452), a graver peril requiring immediate attention confronted the monarch. Perhaps encouraged by the success of previous invaders, the king of Canara menaced the realm. De Couto thus refers to the event: \u201cNot long afterwards the emperor was very unexpectedly attacked by a large army that had been sent by the king of Canara to Ceylon with a numerous fleet, but the prince having speedily gathered together some troops defeated that mighty army, which act gave him a very formidable name throughout the whole East, and caused him to be greatly beloved by his people.\u201d\u00b3 According to the Kovul Sand\u00e9\u1e63a the fort of\n\n\u00b9 De Couto, Journ., R.A.S (C.B.), vol. XX., p. 69.\n\u00b2 \u015ar\u00ed Ku\u1e0d\u00e1 Kum\u00e1ray\u00e1, younger prince, called Ambulugala from the capital of his principality. His name was Jayav\u00edra, which was also the name of the king\u2019s grandson, the son of Ulakuday\u00e1 D\u00e9vi.\n\u00b3 It would appear from references in contemporary literature that Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu carried the war into the enemy\u2019s territory, but this cannot clearly be ascertained, because of the undoubted invasion of India soon after. Perhaps the succeeding events formed part of the same campaign, and originated in the attempt of the king of Canara to conquer Ceylon.\nJ\u00e1vakak\u00f3tt\u00e9 (Ch\u00e1v\u00e1kachch\u00e9ri) was built and manned by Malays to keep back the Canarese. A contemporary bard alludes to the event in the following lines:\n\nHaving made the four oceans the bounds of his impartial august sway, he blew away the fierce wrath of the famous Kanna\u1e0di (Canarese) king.\n\nIn this reign we see the beginnings of that trade in cinnamon to secure which the Island became in later times the battleground of the Dutch and Portuguese. Shortly after repulsing the Canarese invader the king despatched a vessel with cinnamon to the Malabar Coast, which landed in the bay of Adir\u00e1mapat\u1e6danam or Adrampet. But the ruler there, R\u00e1ja V\u00edra R\u00e1m\u00e1 Malava R\u00e1yar, probably a feudatory of the Lord of Chola, made a descent on the vessel, plundered the cargo, and took all the men captive. So successful had been his reorganizing policy that when intelligence of this wanton act of aggression reached K\u00f3tt\u00e9 it found the monarch strong enough to take immediate measures in retaliation. He organized a punitive expedition, and a large fleet carrying troops sailed at the royal bidding to punish the insolence of the Tamil prince. Par\u00e1krama\u2019s troops ravaged his country with fire and sword. V\u00edra R\u00e1m\u00e1 himself was slain. Thence the Sinhalese forces entered the Chola (Mysore) country, and plundering several villages and a port on their march, they stormed the fortress M\u00e1kudam K\u00f3tt\u00e9, comprising seven dependent villages, which thereafter yielded a yearly tribute to K\u00f3tt\u00e9.\n\n---\n\n1 Gir\u00e1 Sand\u00e9\u015ba, v. 132.\n2 In Valentyn, Driampat\u1e6danam; in the R\u00faj\u00e1valiya, \u00c1yapattana, corrupted in some MSS. to Yap\u00e1pat\u1e6dana, was Adrampet (Adrampatnam, Advira R\u00e1mapatnam in Tamil, \u201cthe city of the great hero R\u00e1m\u00e1\u201d), seaport in the Pattu Kotta t\u00e1luk, Tanjore Dist., Madras Presidency, lat. 10\u00b0 20' 10\" N., and long. 79\u00b0 25' 40\" E.

The kingdom of the \"five highland districts,\" Kanda\u00fada Pas-rata,\u00b3 or the Kandyan kingdom, was at this period ruled by an under-king called J\u00f3tiya Si\u1e6du Raja.\u2074 Probably an able adventurer, not of princely rank, as his name implies, had vaulted to the Kandyan throne and had up to the present acknowledged the over-lordship of K\u00f3tt\u00e9 by an annual payment of tribute. Ambitious to reign as an independent prince, he ceased to furnish the annual contingent of labourers for the customary service to the emperor, and declined to forward to the capital the share of the revenue due to the imperial treasury.\u2075 He sought to win over his subjects by a magnificent display of imperial power. He summoned the people of the five districts to assemble for his public assumption of supreme authority, and he bid for the support of his chieftains by lavish grants of villages and great titles of honour, which were more prized by the Kandyan nobles we are told even at that period than endowments of land.\u2076 When intelligence of the revolt of king J\u00f3tiya Si\u1e6du reached the court, the emperor summoned the army, gave the chief command to Jayav\u00edra Ku\u1e0d\u00e1 Kum\u00e1ray\u00e1, who was stationed at Ambulugala, and entrusted him with the task of reducing the highlands (circa 1463\u20131467).\u2077 The untrained mountaineers\n\n\u00b9 Mukkaras, an Indian tribe.\n\u00b2 I.e., by killing the queen he destroyed the chance of king Mukara obtaining an heir, and thus destroyed his race.\n\u00b3 Udunuvara, Ya\u1e6dinuvara, H\u00e1rispattuva, H\u00e9v\u00e1heta, Dumbara.\n\u2074 As his name signifies, J\u00f3tiya Si\u1e6du R\u00e1ja probably did not belong to any of the recognized Kshatriya ruling houses, but was a member of the Vaisya caste (Velanda) to which the Set\u1e6di or Si\u1e6du (Sk. sr\u0113\u015b\u1e6dha, \"nobles\") belonged. Accessions to the noble orders by Set\u1e6di were frequently made from the ranks of the common people, the qualification being the possession of a certain stated amount of wealth. The title thus conferred became hereditary.\n\u2075 R\u00e1j\u00e1valiya, p. 69.\n\u2076 Valenty\u0144's \"Account of Sinhalese History.\" (Appendix B.)\nwere no match for the seasoned soldiers of the royal army.

J\u00f3tiya Situ was himself driven out of the highlands,\\(^1\\) and his territory entrusted to a prince of the Gampola royal line\\(^2\\) and to a council of ministers with the obligation of vassalage to the throne.\\(^3\\) The victor returned in triumph to K\u00f3tt\u00e9 and presented himself before the emperor, who sent him back to his provincial government loaded with ranks and honours.\n\nSome years later, the king proposed to consolidate his power by bringing the scattered jurisdiction of the Vanni chieftains under the central authority. Centuries ago, the intervening belt of country between the kingdom of Jaffna and the Sinhalese provinces of the Sat K\u00f3ral\u00e9 and Uda-pas-ra\u1e6da had been overrun by warlike bands of Tamils from the opposite coast, under turbulent chieftains called Vanniy\u00e1rs. They settled in this wild territory, carved out kingdoms for themselves, and defied the authority of successive Sinhalese rulers.\n\nPowerful monarchs like the great Par\u00e1krama, Vijaya B\u00e1hu III., and Pandita Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu II., induced them more often by gifts than by force to acknowledge the Sinhalese\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) \u0913 \u091a \u0930\u0947\u0924\u0902 \u0905\u0930\u094d\u0927\u0947 \u0926\u093f\u0935\u0902\n\n\\(^2\\) \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0924\u0902 \u0936\u0930\u0923\u0902 \u0926\u0947\u0935\u0902 \u0926\u0947\u0935\u0902\n\n\\(^3\\) \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0924\u0902 \u0936\u0930\u0923\u0902 \u0926\u0947\u0935\u0902 \u0926\u0947\u0935\u0902\n\n\\(^4\\) \u0924\u093f \u0924\u093f \u0924\u093f \u0924\u093f \u0924\u093f \u0924\u093f \u0924\u093f \u0924\u093f\n\n\u2014\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u0943\u0924\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0935\u094d\u092f\u092e\u094d, 58 \u0905.\n\nWhat time J\u00f3tiya assembled his four-fold array, the body of darkness which went by the name of king J\u00f3tiya Situ was scared away by the Solar king Par\u00e1krama, like another king B\u00e1tiya, and fled for refuge to a foreign clime.\u2014Perakumb\u00e1sirita, v. 58.\n\nThroughout this stanza there is a play on the name of J\u00f3tiya, meaning \u201cmoon or star,\u201d which is difficult to be adequately rendered into English.

But the homage thus rendered was only at intervals and during their reigns. For nearly the ten previous centuries, owing to the dissensions in the kingdom, the Vanni chieftains left to themselves, had grown powerful and recognized no over-lord. The district had become Tamil, the thick jungles which covered the land made the country inaccessible, and the rocky fortresses where their forts were pitched made their strongholds impregnable. Par\u00e1kr\u00e1ma decided to reduce them. At this period the tract was divided into eighteen districts or Vannis, each ruled by a Vanniyar or chieftain. They warred and hunted, and roamed the thick woods with the wild elephants in unrestrained liberty, until the silence of their solitudes was broken by the tramp of the royal army. Par\u00e1kr\u00e1ma B\u00e1hu himself marched at the head of his forces, and personally directed operations from the city of Dambadeniya, which he made his headquarters. After a stubborn campaign, during which several hill forts were stormed, the Vannis at length submitted. They paid a yearly tribute of elephants to the suzerain, which they continued to render to K\u00f3tt\u00e9 till the reign of Don Jo\u00e3\u00f5 Dharmap\u00e1la (1551-1597).\n\nThe conquest of the Vannis on his frontiers alarmed the king of Jaffna, and he took precautions to safeguard his dominions. Relying on his former prestige, \u00c1rya Chakkravarti defied the Sinhalese monarch by having himself also proclaimed emperor of Ceylon. By this act he publicly asserted his claim to Sinhalese territory and reminded his neighbour of the time when the king of Jaffna exacted tribute from Sinhalese lands and ports. \u0160r\u00ed Par\u00e1kr\u00e1ma B\u00e1hu had at length obtained the provocation for putting in execution a design which he had long meditated. He was incensed at the affront, and determined, to quote his own words, \u201cthere should no longer be two kings in Ceylon.\u201d He entrusted the royal army for the conquest of Jaffna to his general, Sapumal Kum\u00e1ra, with this grim message to be conveyed to the lord of Jaffna: \u201cTell him,\u201d jested the king, \u201csince it ill becomes that Ceylon should have two emperors, I have sent my general to relieve you of that\n\n---\n\n1 Mah\u00e1va\u1e47sa (Wijesinha), pp. 272, 280.\n2 Perakumbasirita, v. 46; Paravi Sand\u00e9\u015ba, v. 34.\n3 R\u00e1j\u00e1valiya, p. 68.\nnew title, and as you could not rest and were not content with what you had, to give you somewhat more rest.\u201d\u00b9 The conquest of Jaffna, though lightly undertaken, was not easily achieved. The power which scarce half a century ago had owned the allegiance of the greater portion of the Island, and was still mistress of the seas, would not yield her independence without a struggle. \u0100rya Chakkravarti\u2019s outposts offered a stubborn resistance to the invader, and the Sinhalese general, after having raided several villages belonging to the kingdom of Jaffna and taken many prisoners of war, had to retire without being able to penetrate to the northern capital.\u00b2 The presentation of the Tamil captives from Jaffna at court concealed from the people the failure of the main object of the expedition, and gave to the war in the popular imagination the character of another triumph of the Sinhalese arms. However, \u015ar\u012b Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu was not content with the results of the campaign. Soon his army was again in motion under the same general to conquer the north.\u00b3 Sapumal Kum\u00e1ra captured the chain of border fortresses which had been erected by the king of Jaffna as a security against any attack on the capital.\u2074 When intelligence reached him that the Sinhalese commander had burst his defences and was marching on the city, he despatched three of his most distinguished chieftains to oppose his progress. First went forth Kontak\u00e1ra Demalis, then advanced Panigavaram, who was followed by Valamunivorusa.\u2075 In a short space, they were one after another all cut down by Sapumal Kum\u00e1ray\u00e1. The anxious monarch, at length, it is stated, despatched a brave chieftain called Varak\u00e1ra,\u2076 who had taken an oath to hew the Sinhalese leader in pieces, to resist the enemy\u2019s advance. As he forced his passage through the enemy\u2019s ranks Varak\u00e1ra was stabbed by the Sinhalese ere he made his way to Sapumal Kum\u00e1ray\u00e1.

However, he had misjudged the wily character of his foe, and nearly paid with his life the penalty of his rashness. \u00c1rya Chakkravarti had placed an ambush of a choice body of his troops called the Doluvara to strike down the prince's horse.\\(^1\\) From the histories it would appear that he almost fell into the snare. The conqueror of Jaffna was a champion of exceeding great size, of prodigious strength, of a fine majestic presence, and a clever horseman.\\(^2\\) He extricated himself from the press as much by his skill in striking down the foe who crowded round him as by his fine horsemanship. \"He curvetted his steed with spirit and grace,\" runs the chronicle, \"struck the foe in the very centre and made the streets of Jaffna run red with blood.\"\\(^1\\)\n\n\u00c1rya Chakkravarti fled the realm.\\(^3\\) His queen and children were taken captives to K\u00f3tt\u00e9 to deck the triumph of the conqueror.\\(^1\\) In a stanza of the Selalihini Sand\u00e9sa is reflected the prevalent popular feeling of the time, the note of eager expectation, and the confident hope of victory with which the people awaited his return.\n\n\"Lo!

Sapumal Kum\u00e1ray\u00e1 thence appears to have gone as viceroy to the ancient capital of Y\u00e1pahu, the seat of the provincial government of the Hat (Seven) K\u00f3ral\u00e9, which he continued to rule till summoned to the imperial throne. Of the events that followed the death of \u015ar\u00ed Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu and of the origin and youth of the princes Sapumal Kum\u00e1ray\u00e1, Jayav\u00edra Kud\u00e1 Kum\u00e1ray\u00e1, and Jayav\u00edra the king\u2019s grandson, who were all afterwards destined to play so important a part in the history of the Island, the old Portuguese historian De Couto alone of the annalists has preserved\n\n---\n\n1 Although it would appear from the R\u00e1j\u00e1valiya (Gunas\u00e9kara\u2019s translation), pp. 69, 70, and Kovul Sandesa, that Sapumal Kum\u00e1ray\u00e1 continued as ruler of Jaffna after the subjugation of the peninsula till he left it at the head of an invading force to march on K\u00f3tt\u00e9, the facts would seem to be otherwise. Valentyn and the Yalpana-Vaipava Malai (Brito), pp. lxxv.-lxxvi., the former derived from Sinhalese sources, and the latter, a Tamil historical record, both agree that Jaffna was restored to a nephew of \u00c1rya Chakravarti. Valentyn alone gives the name Arietattoe Adduru Prauwmal, clearly a corruption. The error in the R\u00e1j\u00e1valiya appears to have arisen from the similarity of the names Y\u00e1p\u00e1patuna (Jaffna) and Y\u00e1pahu (in Hat K\u00f3rale), and their confusion by ignorant copyists. The Kurun\u00e9gala Vistaraya, an old topographical record, compiled about the 15th or 16th century, incidentally mentions the fact that Sapumal Kum\u00e1ray\u00e1 ruled as viceroy at Y\u00e1pahu after leaving Jaffna, and thus gives the clue to the mystery.\n\n3 The events following the death of \u015ar\u00ed Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu more properly belong to the reign of Jayav\u00edra Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu. De Couto considerably modifies the relation in the Sinhalese R\u00e1j\u00e1valiya and throws a different complexion on the conduct of the conqueror of Jaffna.\nto us the memory. \"This king had no son, but had a daughter who was married to Cholca Raya of the race of the ancient kings, by whom he had a son, whom his grandfather swore in as heir to the throne.

These three lads grew up, and came to have such power in the kingdom, that the king noticed in them a change of disposition, from which he feared that on his death they would murder his grandson.\\(^3\\) And dissembling in regard to this, he resolved to separate them, which he did, commanding the two brothers to go and subject for him the king of Jaffnapata\u00f5, which had rebelled against him, conferring on the elder one, who was called Qu\u00e9ba Permal (Champaka Perum\u00e1l), the title of king of that dominion with the obligation of vassalage. This man, who was a very great horseman, and of the greatest size and strength of any of that time, in a few days made himself master of that dominion.\"\\(^4\\)\n\nBefore closing the record of this reign one important act of civil administration deserves to be noted.

His mild and beneficent sway and his victories deeply attached him to his subjects, who, as we read in contemporary verse, compared him to his namesake the Great Par\u00e1krama; and as the shadows of his long reign lengthened, his grateful people called to mind the old prophecy, which foretold the dawn of a bright era under a great and righteous emperor who would rule the world with clemency and justice; and they loved to behold mirrored in their beloved sovereign the righteous lord who would bear sway \"when twice five thousand years have rolled away.\"\n\n\"O tell me, traveller, from whence you wend your way? \u2014 From Samanala, Brahman, have I arrived this day.

The peace and tranquillity and the greatness of his reign were such that in the dark days of Portuguese tyranny and religious persecution men looked back to his time as to a golden age, and awaited a national deliverer in a successor of his line who would continue his victorious tradition, build anew the walls of his capital, and revive the glory and the ancient faith of the Sinhalese monarchy.\n\nAPPENDIX A.\n\nIt is strange that there should be so much misconception about the identity of \u015ar\u012b Par\u0101krama B\u0101hu VI.'s parents, considering that there is direct contemporary evidence on the point.\n\nThe Kudumirisa sannasa of this king refer to a grant by the \"late king my father,\" which proves that \u015ar\u012b Par\u0101krama B\u0101hu VI. was the son, not of a mere prince, but of a reigning sovereign (C.A.S. Jour., VII., 25\u201382).\n\nThe Pepiliy\u0101na inscription records the erection of a shrine in memory of the Queen-mother Sun\u0113tra Mah\u0101 D\u00e9vi of the Giriva\u1e47sa (C.A.S. Jour., X., 34).\n\nThe Perakumb\u00e1 Sirita, after describing the founder of the royal house, Prince Sumitra \"of \u00c1soka's lineage,\" created Jaya Mah\u0101 L\u00e9na, and the achievements of the other great monarchs of this line, explicitly mentions the parents of the king. I subjoin a literal translation by Mr. W. P. Ranesinghe. He adds, that \"it is probable that Lemeni Jayamahala was crowned Vijaya B\u0101hu,\" and suggests that \"there must have been many Jayamahal\u00e9nas from the time of Devenip\u00e9tissa to that of Par\u0101krama B\u0101hu VI.\"\n\n\"In the unblemished line of such illustrious sovereigns of power and great sway was the son of Vijaya B\u0101hu of the S\u0113vulu race and grandson of King Par\u0101krama, a prince who was an embryo\nBuddha, born of the great Queen Sun\u00e9tra, who was like a golden vine entwining the wish-conferring tree like Lemeni Jayamahala.\u201d\u2014v. 27.\n\n\u015ar\u012b R\u00e1hula in the K\u00e1vyas\u00e9khara describes in glowing stanzas the lineage of the king and the names of his parents. Here too, the dynasty is traced to \u201cPrince Sumit of the S\u00f3l\u00e1r dynasty, who was maternal uncle of Mahinda, son of Dharma \u00c1s\u00f3ka, 237 B.C.\u201d (Part XIV., vv. 61, 62.)\n\nPrince Sumit was invested by D\u00e9vanampiya Tissa with the rank of Jayamah\u00e1lena, \u201cChief Secretary for War,\u201d amid great pomp, and given the hand of Princess Sumana of Magadha, a novice who resided at the temple of Sanghamitta (Part IV., v. 66).\n\nTo them and their descendants was assigned the custody of the B\u00f3-tree (Part XIX., vv. 67, 68; B\u00f3dhivansa).\n\nThe following verses (K\u00e1vyas\u00e9khara, 69-71 in Part XIV.) support the other authorities regarding the parentage of the king: \u201cIn this the thirty-fourth year of the reign of King Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu, the celebrated K\u00e1vyas\u00e9khara was composed and terminated in language elegant. He was an ocean of gem-like virtues, a diadem on the heads of all kings, grandson of Jayamahal\u00e9na, who was an ornament to the Lambakarna race. He came from the good lineage of the illustrious Vijaya B\u00e1hu of the S\u00e9vulu race and of the puissant Par\u00e1krama the Great and of Agrabodhi and Vijaya B\u00e1hu.\u201d Mr. W. P. Ranesinghe, to whom I am indebted for the translation, says that according to these lines, \u201cthe descent of \u015ar\u012b Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu from all the above kings, including Vijaya B\u00e1hu, is clear, and confirms the statement in the P\u00e9arakumb\u00e1 Sirita and the R\u00e1j\u00e1valiya.\u201d\n\nValentyn states that the monarch was \u201cof the unsullied race of the Emperor Socca (\u00c1s\u00f3ka) Raj\u00e1 and of the family of Ittahassammata (Mah\u00e1sammata), and of Simit (Sumit) Raj\u00e1, a nephew of the Emperor Praccaram (Par\u00e1krama) Vij\u00e9 (Vijaya) Raj\u00e1, and a son of the Emperor Savlu Vija (S\u00e9vulu Vijaya) Bahu Raja, and of the Empress Simittra D\u00e9wa (Sun\u00e9tra D\u00e9vi).\u201d\n\nThe R\u00e1j\u00e1valiya, although the pages referring to the Chinese invasions have been tampered with, says that Vijaya B\u00e1hu was the father of Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu, and that his mother was Sun\u00e9tra D\u00e9vi.\n\n\u201cHere it must be observed that it was in the year 1958 of the illustrious Buddhist era, on Thursday, the seventh day of the bright half of the month Wesak, and the asterism Phusa, that King Vijaya B\u00e1hu was taken captive. Whereupon his Queen, Sun\u00e9tra D\u00e9vi, left the city and went to Visidagama, taking her son with her.\u201d\u2014p. 67.\n\nE. W. Perera.\nAPPENDIX B.\n\nThe following translation of Valentyn\u2019s account of this period is by Mr. Donald Ferguson, and appeared in the Ceylon Observer, September, 1897:\n\n\"The King Boewanaca (Bhuvaneka) Bahu Raja, learning that his dominions were now entirely freed from all enemies, returned once more with a quiet heart to his kingdom of Degampala. But the Cingalese swore that they would never acknowledge such a coward as their king; but there was then a prince, reared in the Pagode of Vida Gamma, who, on account of his illustrious origin, might be compared to the sun, as he was of the princely blood, and of the unsullied race of the Emperor Socca (\u00c1s\u00f3ka) Raja, and of the family of Ittahasammatta Raja, and of Simit Raja, a nephew of the Emperor Praccaram Viga (Par\u00e1krama Vijaya) Raja, and a son of the Emperor Savluviga (S\u00e9vulu Vijaya) B\u00e1hu Raja, and of the Empress Simittra Dewa.\n\n\"This prince was set upon the throne of the Emperor of Cotta, with the name of Rucaule Praccaram Bahu Raja, on the 8th day (new moon) of the month of May, upon a Thursday, by the Gane or Priest Atahasuwamie, also of the royal house, residing in a Pagode.\n\n\"He married a princess of the royal house from the village of Quirivella, who was of the family of Othurudda Comara.\n\n\"Thereupon having been crowned (which period is described as having been 1,958 years after the death of Budun, or 1,415 years after the birth of Christ), he remained 3 years at Reygamme (Rayigama), then removed to Cotta, there built a fine city, entirely of solid blue stone, and a beautiful palace of the same stone; but with a sort of new fangled galleries, and with a number of new temples of devils, and of the idols that he worshipped. Here he dwelt in company with a priest (\u015ar\u00ed R\u00e1hula), whom he esteemed very highly, preserved here the relics of Budun, and built a special house or monastery for his priests. He also took as his adopted sons two princes of imperial blood, Sappoe (Sapumal) Comara and Coeda (Ku\u1e0d\u00e1) Comara, to whom he showed very great favour.\n\n\"Some time after that the empress gave birth to a daughter, to whom was given the name of Ulacoedajanam Dewa, which Dewa betokens a goddess in their language.\n\n\"Not long afterwards the emperor was very unexpectedly attacked by a large army that had been sent by the King of Canara to Ceylon with a numerous fleet; but the prince having\nspeedily gathered together some troops, defeated that mighty army, which act gave him a very formidable name throughout the whole East, and caused him to be greatly beloved by his people.\n\n\"Shortly afterwards he sent a vessel with cinnamon to the opposite coast of Malabar, which came to land in the Bay of Driampatam; but it was attacked in a hostile manner by the ruler there, Rajam Malavaragam (Malava R\u00e1yar), and all that was in it was carried off, besides that he took all the men captives.\n\n\"The emperor hearing of this caused the country of this ruler to be immediately ravaged by his troops with fire and sword. Thence they proceeded to another territory, named Soliratta, captured the town of Mahacoelan Cottaja, further destroying seven of its dependent villages, after which victory they returned rejoicing.\"\n\n\"While all was now quiet in the emperor's dominions in Ceylon, there was in the highlands a prince, named Jottia Sitti or Jothia Stoenam Raja, who, having been accustomed to pay tribute annually to the emperor, now informed him that he did not intend to do so in future. He thereupon caused his people out of the five districts over which he ruled to be assembled, and resolved to sever himself from the emperor, and to assume authority as a prince on his own account; therefore, in order to induce his followers the more firmly to adhere to him, he partitioned out to various nobles many villages and lands, and conferred upon them great titles of honour (on which the Cingalese are much set).\n\n\"The emperor having heard of this sent a great army against him, slew many thousands of his people, took prisoners many of the nearest blood relations of this rebellious prince (and when he had driven the prince himself out of Candi), established one of his adopted sons, Ampoeloewagala Comara, a vassal who paid him tribute annually as King of Candy.\n\n\"Some years afterwards eighteen other village chiefs of the Vannias submitted to the emperor, by which his kingdom was further greatly increased.\n\n\"The King of Jaffnapatnam, fearing that the emperor would be further revenged upon him in one way or another, took all needful precautions against this, but meanwhile also had himself proclaimed as Emperor of Ceylon, which the Emperor of Cotta had no sooner learnt, than he resolved on the spot to make himself master of Jaffnapatnam, and sent an army under Sappoe (Sapumal) Comara thither, and let the king know through that general that since it was improper that Ceylon should have two emperors, he had sent that general to relieve him of that new title, and as he could not rest, and was not content with what he had, to give him somewhat more rest.\"\n\"This general in the first place seized many of the king's territories; but when the latter heard that he had begun to draw near to the city of Jaffnapatnam, he sent one of his courtiers, Conta Cara Demalis, and then a second and third, named Panigevorum and Valamunivorussa,\\(^{17}\\) to stop him; but they were all three in a short time slain by Sappoe Comara, who now made it evident that he intended, with his blue horse with the green mane,\\(^{18}\\) to invest the city.\n\n\"The anxious king, seeing him arrive, sent Varacara,\\(^{19}\\) a bold knight, against him, who had undertaken to hew him in pieces, but he was stabbed by his men ere he came near him. Meanwhile the Prince Sappoe Comara got into the city, conquered it and all the king's realm, took many of his nobles prisoners, and brought them in a body, since the king himself had fled, to the emperor, who appointed one of his nephews, by name Ariattetoe Addum Prauwmal,\\(^{19}\\) King of Jaffnapatnam.\\(^{20}\\)\n\n\"After that this emperor reigned in great peace for the space of fifty-five years, spending most of the end of his lifetime in the service of the gods.\"\n\nNotes.\n\n1 Vid\u00e1gama.

Ranesinghe\u2019s identification of places, which he has been kind enough to furnish me with, in this most typical of the sand\u00e9sas. The identity which I have noted in the text of Gurub\u0113bila with modern Hanwella, on the authority of a High Priest of Kelaniya, though based on tradition, appears to be unfounded, in view of Mr. Ranesinghe\u2019s explanation of how Gurub\u0113bila came to be corrupted into W\u00e1nagurugod\u0113lla:\n\n(1) K\u00f3tt\u00e9.\n(2) Kontaganto\u1e6da (ferry on the Diyavann\u0101wa).\n(3) Anganpi\u1e6diya (not mentioned in sand\u00e9sa).\n(4) Isuru K\u00f3vila = chapel or church built on the site of the d\u00e9w\u00e1la from its materials.\n\n(5) Kaik\u00e1wala=(Tam. kai, hand, and k\u00e1wal, guard) the sentry-post where the watch was kept by guards armed with bows, spears, and swords = (?)

S. National Museum, under direction of Smithsonian Institute, for year ending June 30, 1888, p. 428.\n\nE. W. Perera.\n\nAPPENDIX E.\n\nMr. Perera says that \u201cthe S\u00e9lalihini Sand\u00e9sa describes the route between K\u00f3tt\u00e9 and Kelaniya. The distance being short, the bird is made to take a circuitous course, by way of Gurub\u00e9bila (Ha\u00f1wella) on to Kelaniya, to enable the poet to describe the intervening country.\u201d This is not correct. The bird would appear to have taken the then usual route, and the places described in the work all lie between K\u00f3tt\u00e9 and Kelaniya. Gurub\u00e9ulla mentioned in the sand\u00e9sa is the village now known as Vanagurugod\u00e9lla, situated about midway between K\u00f3tt\u00e9 and Kelaniya, and not Gurub\u00e9bila in Ha\u00f1wella. In the Hansa Sand\u00e9sa, the swan\nconveying a message from K\u00f3tt\u00e9 to K\u00e9ragala in S\u00edn\u00e1 K\u00f3ral\u00e9 has taken the same route as far as K\u00e9laniya, and in that work the situation of Gurube\u00fala is clearly defined. The bird is told that from Gurube\u00fala he could see the village Gotatuwa on his left and Welandagoda on his right, and the great Vih\u00e1r\u00e9 (Kitsirim\u00e9) before him. The temple Kitsirim\u00e9 is on the left bank of the river facing K\u00e9laniya, and the villages of Gotatuwa and Welandagoda are on either side of Vanagurugod\u00e9lla.\n\n(2) Mr. Perera quotes a stanza from P\u00e9arakumb\u00e1 Sirita in support of his theory that \u015ar\u00ed Par\u00e1kr\u00e1ma B\u00e1hu was the son of V\u00edra Vijaya B\u00e1hu. This stanza has been entirely misunderstood and incorrectly translated. The meaning of the stanza is clear, i.e., that Par\u00e1kr\u00e1ma B\u00e1hu was the son of L\u00e9meni Jayamahala, whose father was Vijaya B\u00e1hu and grandfather Par\u00e1kr\u00e1ma B\u00e1hu. Par\u00e1kr\u00e1ma B\u00e1hu herein referred to was Par\u00e1kr\u00e1ma B\u00e1hu the Great of Polonnaruwa, as may be seen from the K\u00e1vyas\u00e9khara of \u015ar\u00ed R\u00e1hula, and not \u015ar\u00ed Par\u00e1kr\u00e1ma\u2019s mother\u2019s father, as stated by Mr. Perera. It can be shown from other contemporary writers that \u015ar\u00ed Par\u00e1kr\u00e1ma B\u00e1hu was the son of Jayamahala.\n\n(3) It is stated that \u201cthe king\u2019s wish is reflected in the poetical message contained in \u015ar\u00ed R\u00e1hula\u2019s S\u00e9alalihini Sand\u00e9sa, invoking the lily-coloured god Vishnu at Dondra for the blessing of a son for the Princess Ulaku\u1e0da D\u00e9vi.\u201d This is incomprehensible. The message was clearly sent to the god Vibh\u00edsana at K\u00e9laniya, and there is no mention in the work either of Dondra or of the lily-coloured god Vishnu.\n\n(4) Mr. Perera goes on to say that \u201cPar\u00e1kr\u00e1ma B\u00e1hu struck off the head of the usurper Alak\u00e9svara at the bidding of V\u00edd\u00e1gama Mah\u00e1 S\u00e1mi.\u201d I can think of no authority for this statement. The R\u00e1j\u00e1valiya, the only work which speaks of this event, does not support it.\n\nSimon de Silva.\n\nAPPENDIX F.\n\nI must protest against the slur cast\u2014unconsciously no doubt\u2014upon a name held in high honour in the history of the Buddhist church. It is unfair to connect V\u00edd\u00e1gama Mah\u00e1 S\u00e1mi with the assassination of Alak\u00e9svara, on what must be considered very slight and doubtful evidence.\n\nI cannot agree with the identification of Gurube\u00fala mentioned in the S\u00e9alalihini Sand\u00e9sa with Gurube\u00fala near Hanwella. The place mentioned in the poem is on the direct road from K\u00f3tt\u00e9 to K\u00e9laniya, and is at the present time known as Vanagurugod\u00e9lla.\nThe translation of the verse quoted from the Perakumb\u0101 Sirita (p. 7) is not accurate. It should read: \"A royal personage\u2014a future Buddha\u2014was born to the Queen Sun\u0113tra Mah\u0101 D\u00e9vi\u2014the golden vine that entwined the celestial tree, the lord Jaya Mah\u0101 Lena, grandson of King Par\u0101krama B\u00e1hu, who was the son of King Savulu Vijaya B\u00e1hu . . . . . .\"\n\nLastly, I cannot support the attempt to make Alak\u0113svara a foreign usurper. It is contended that Giriva\u1e47sa, to which he belonged, was a Dravidian family in India. But according to the Nik\u0101ya Sangrahawa (p. 24) the full name of this family was Amaragirivasa. Amaragiri is another name for D\u00e9vanagala (in the K\u00e9galla District). The original settlement of the Alak\u0113svara family was apparently D\u00e9vanagala; and though the original founder may have come from India, the family had long been in the Island, and the great Alak\u0113svara ought not to be regarded as a Dravidian usurper.\n\nD. B. Jayatilaka.\n\nAPPENDIX G.\n\nFirst, with regard to the death of Alak\u0113svara. I do not think that that great statesman was murdered at all; least of all by Visid\u0101gama, the chief hierarch of the Buddhist church. The commanding personality of Alak\u0113svara had been absent from the field of Ceylon politics for many years before Par\u0101krama B\u00e1hu VI. came to the throne. The presumption, therefore, is that he had been long dead at that time, and that the story of his usurpation and of his tragic death which followed in consequence is all a picturesque fable invented in later times.\n\nSecondly, I do not think that King Par\u0101krama B\u00e1hu VI. was the son of \u015ar\u012b V\u012bra Vijaya B\u00e1hu VI., although that has always been the accepted opinion, and is so still. The authority quoted from Perakumb\u0101 Sirita\u2014far from supporting the accepted opinion\u2014seems to go far to destroy it. It says that King Par\u0101krama B\u00e1hu was the son of Jaya Mah\u0101 Lena (Secretary for War), a nobleman of the L\u0113m\u0113ni branch of the royal race. Now, Jaya Mah\u0101 Lena and \u015ar\u012b V\u012bra Vijaya B\u00e1hu are clearly not identical. For the one was merely a royal scion, while the other was a king; and the one belonged to the L\u0113m\u0113ni branch of the royal stock, while the other belonged to the \"Mehenawara Va\u1e47sa,\" the branch sprung from the priestess. I think, therefore, that the paternity of Par\u0101krama B\u00e1hu VI., as given by the writer, according to the received opinion, must be considerably revised.\n\nW. F. Gunawardana.\nAPPENDIX H.\n\nIt is unfortunate that Mudaliy\u00e1r Simon de Silva took no part in the discussion at the Meeting. His Memorandum (Appendix E) subsequently sent in is on much the same lines as Mr. D. B. Jayatilaka\u2019s criticisms. I shall first shortly deal with the two minor points (1) and (3) contained in the Mudaliy\u00e1r\u2019s Memorandum.\n\n(1) As explained at the Meeting, I had no decided opinion in regard to the identification of Gurub\u0113bila, and was prepared to accept any reasonable explanation from those who had greater local knowledge. For further information on the question, vide Appendix C.\n\n(3) Vishnu for Vibh\u00edsana was an oversight, since corrected.\n\n(2) The Mudaliy\u00e1r challenges what he calls my \u201ctheory that \u015ar\u012b Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu was the son of Vira Vijaya B\u00e1hu,\u201d on the assumption that I have \u201centirely misunderstood and incorrectly translated\u201d the stanza from the Perakumb\u00e1 Sirita. No reason is given why grammatically or otherwise the words cannot be rendered in the sense taken by Mr. W. P. Ranesinghe, who has favoured me with a translation. His rendering (vide Appendix A) makes it convey the meaning that Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu VI. \u201cwas the son of Vijaya B\u00e1hu of the Sevulu race and grandson of King Par\u00e1krama.\u201d It will scarcely be contended that this careful scholar, too, \u201centirely misunderstood and incorrectly translated\u201d the stanza. It is the only way it can be rendered consistently with the other contemporary authorities, which bear out that \u015ar\u012b Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu VI. was the son of Sevulu Vijaya B\u00e1hu.\n\nFurther, it is stated in the Mudaliy\u00e1r\u2019s Memorandum, that \u201cPar\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu herein referred to was Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu the Great of Polonnaruwa.\u201d This cannot be, as Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu the Great (1164\u20131197) was not the \u201cgrandfather\u201d of \u015ar\u012b Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu VI. (1412\u20131467). According to the K\u0101vyas\u0113khara, which is cited in support of this view, it was a \u201cJaya Mah\u00e1 Lena\u201d who was \u201cgrandfather\u201d of \u015ar\u012b Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu VI. (vide Appendix A). Even if \u201cgrandfather\u201d be taken in the extended sense of \u201cancestor,\u201d the Mudaliy\u00e1r will not be supported by the authority to which he appeals, for the \u201cgrandfather\u201d or \u201cancestor\u201d mentioned in the K\u0101vyas\u0113khara is Jaya Mah\u00e1 Lena and not Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu the Great. That Jaya Mah\u00e1 in that stanza refers to the \u201cancestor,\u201d the founder of the house, there is very little doubt. De Couto states that \u015ar\u012b Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu\u2019s mother\u2019s father was King Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu, which is consistent with the statement in the Perakumb\u00e1 Sirita. The Mudaliy\u00e1r\nshould have cited \"the other contemporary writer\" from whom \"it can be shown that \u015ar\u012b Par\u0101krama B\u0101hu was the son of Jaya Mahala.\" That monarch's own sannas declare that his father was \"king,\" and the R\u0101j\u0101valiya and Valentyn bear out that he was Vijaya B\u0101hu VI. (vide Appendix A).\n\n(4) In saying that he \"can think of no authority\" for my statement that \"Par\u0101karama B\u0101hu struck off the head of the usurper Alak\u0113svara at the bidding of V\u012bd\u0101gama Mah\u0101 S\u0101mi,\" the Mudaliy\u0101r has forgotten to quote the two previous words of the sentence, \"Legend says.\"* The R\u0101j\u0101valiya, which he declares \"does not support it,\" states: \"In this manner the prince lived in obscurity until he had attained the age of 16 years, when the elder Visid\u0101gama summoned the leading men, and having consulted together, sent for the prince; and, without the knowledge of Alak\u0113svara, brought him out to the people under the asterism Phusa, on Thursday, the 7th day of the bright fortnight of the month Wesak. Having caused Alak\u0113svara to be put to death, he raised the prince to the throne under the name of \u015ar\u012b Par\u0101krama B\u0101hu.\" The legend merely supplies the detail who was the agent the priest employed to kill the usurper.\n\nThe identification of Gurub\u0113bila with Hanwella would appear to have as much warrant as its identification with Vanagurugod\u0113lla. But I expressed no decided view, and will yield to special local knowledge.\n\nThe question of the origin of Alak\u0113svara has no immediate bearing on the subject, and was fully dealt with by me in a previous Paper. The contemporary authorities quoted there show conclusively that he belonged to a Dravidian family from Conjeveram, whose settlement was at Rayigam. The proposition that the family name is Amaragirivasa cannot be maintained, as the word merely means that Alak\u0113svara resided at Amaragiri.\n\nE. W. Perera.\n\n5. Simon de Silva, Mudaliy\u0101r, submitted a Memorandum dissenting from some of Mr. Perera's statements,\u2020\n\n6. Mr. D. B. Jayatilaka said that the Paper was very interesting and threw a flood of light upon an exceedingly obscure period of Ceylon history. He drew the attention of the Meeting to a few points in regard to which he could not agree with the writer.\u2021\n\n7. W. F. Gunawardana, Mudaliy\u0101r, disagreed with two points in the Paper.\u00a7\n\n* The \"legend,\"\u2014if such exists, is so manifestly unworthy of credence that it should best be not countenanced.\u2014B., Ed. Sec.\n\u2020 See Appendix E. \u2021 See Appendix F. \u00a7 See Appendix G.\n8. Mr. Harward, referring to the Paper and its subject in a general way, drew attention to the interest attaching to the study of the Chinese invasions of Ceylon, the tribute paid by Ceylon, and the circumstances in which that tribute was terminated. They had not had the Chinese point of view developed, except in the very brief extracts from the Chinese chronicles given in the first volume of Sir Emerson Tennent's \"History of Ceylon.\"\n\n9. Mr. Perera, in reply, said that the chief bone of contention seemed to be that he should have charged a hierarch of the Buddhist church with murder. That was no reflection on the faith. It had happened before that a monk had killed a man, and it might happen again. A cowl did not always make a monk.*\n\n10. The Chairman, in proposing a vote of thanks to Mr. Perera, said it was Papers of that kind which really illustrated the value of a Society such as that to which they belonged; because it brought into the light of day obscure alleys in the history of the country in which they were all living, and called forth discussions such as those to which they had listened that evening. Far be it from him to attempt to adjudicate upon the various points raised. Whether the king, whose history they had just listened to, was himself or was not himself was a point upon which none of them, he felt sure, at a moment's notice would like to pronounce, after the authoritative declaration that he was not himself which they had received from Mudaliy\u0101r Gunawardana. He felt sure that later they would receive from the same quarter a justification of that belief, if only in the form of a Note that might be appended to some issue of the Journal.\n\nThe vote of thanks was carried cordially.\n\n11. Mr. J. Harward read the Annual Report of the Council for 1909:\n\nANNUAL REPORT FOR 1909.\n\nThe Council of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society have the honour to submit their Report for 1909.\n\nMEETINGS AND PAPERS.\n\nFive General Meetings of this Society have been held during the year, at which the following Papers were read and discussed:\n\n(1) \"Letters from R\u00e1jasinha II. to the Dutch,\" by Mr. Donald Ferguson.\n(2) \"Jnana Vasishtam,\" by the Hon.

No previous year in the life of the Arch\u00e6ological Survey has witnessed equal progress, especially at Polonnaruwa and Sigiriya.\n\nI.\u2014ANUR\u00c1DHAPURA.\n\n1.\u2014Clearing.\n\nWith the sum of Rs. 5,000 now made yearly available to the Arch\u00e6ological Commissioner for freeing ruined areas of scrub and rank weeds, all the larger spaces dotted with ruins were kept clear at Anur\u00e1dhapura.\n\nIn addition, was started the systematical clearing of the jungle which has for centuries enveloped the numerous caves and ruined sites at Mihintal\u00e9, known to exist, but barely accessible, on and around the clustered hills.\n\nIt is hoped to follow up this sweep of the undergrowth by resuming excavation of the Mihintal\u00e9 ruins, commenced as long ago as 1893, but since deferred owing to more pressing claims at Anur\u00e1dhapura and elsewhere.\n\n2.\u2014Excavations.\n\nVessagiriya.\u2014The ruins of the ancient Monastery at Vessagiriya surround three rock hummocks, which lie in line north and south close to the main road from Anur\u00e1dhapura to Kurun\u00e9gala. The most northerly rock (A), and the ruins situated to the east of the second rock (B), were dealt with between 1906\u20131908.\n\nDuring the past year (1909), after some heavy cutting, the sites on rock B (two small d\u00e1gabas and a vih\u00e1r\u00e9), its caves, and all ruins adjoining it to the west, have been unearthed.\n\nA quincunx group, probably a vih\u00e1r\u00e9 and four piriven off its angles, with several appurtenant buildings, stand between the middle rock (B) and the southernmost rock (C).\n\nTo round off excavations at Vessagiriya the exploiting of these and of the ground immediately round the foot of rock C alone remains.\n\nII.\u2014POLONNARUWA.\n\nThe Arch\u00e6ological Survey made marked advance in 1909, both in opening up the ancient City and its environs to view by axe and katthy, and in laying bare its far reaching ruins.\n\nWith the exception of a few special sites (mainly those appertaining to the two large D\u00e1gabas, Rankot Vehera and \"Kiri Vehera\") the decade since 1900 (when the Arch\u00e6ological Survey\nfirst broke ground at Polonnaruwa) has witnessed the excavation of all the chief structures of \"Pulastipura,\" from the mistermed \"Demala Mah\u00e1 S\u00e9ya\" on the north as far south as the \"Potgul Vehera\" Monastery, a stretch of four miles.\n\n1.\u2014Clearing.\n\nThe parking of the city was continued by Moor axemen. With a larger gang of Sinhalese at work, the whole of the confines within the walls of the Citadel and City were freed of underwood, except here and there at a few picturesque silvan clumps within which no ruins seem to exist above ground.\n\nOutside the City, northward, all the ruins surrounding the two large D\u00e1gabas, the \"Gal-Vih\u00e1r\u00e9,\" and the \"Una-gala Vehera\" hillock, were also re-cleared.\n\nTo the west, across T\u00f3p\u00e1v\u0113wa tank, the heavy jungle gripping a group of ruins (\"S\u00edtala M\u00e1l\u00edg\u0101wa,\" &c.), which stand quite isolated from the main ruins situated to north and east of the bund, was cut down and burnt.\n\n2.\u2014Excavations.\n\n\"Demala-Mah\u00e1-S\u00e9ya.\"\n\nThis brick-built Buddhist temple is of the type of the so-called \"J\u00e9tawanar\u00e1ma\" and \"Th\u00fap\u00e1r\u00e1ma\" Vih\u00e1r\u00e9s. In size it considerably exceeds the latter.\n\nExteriorly, the brick and stucco ornamentation of its moulded basement and wall face, though carried out on very similar lines, departs from the simplicity of \"Th\u00fap\u00e1r\u00e1ma,\" and is more lavish even than that of \"J\u00e9tawanar\u00e1ma.\" This plethora of surface mouldings and ornament palls on the eye from overcrowding of details and want of proportion.\n\nThe south and east walls stand in fair preservation, but the back (west) wall and much of the north have fallen, whilst the vaulted roof of vestibule and shrine has wholly collapsed.\n\nIn 1885\u201386 the vestibule was unearthed, under the direction of Mr. S. M. Burrows, and disclosed remains of interesting frescoes (Buddhist legends, &c.) on its inner walls.\n\nUnfortunately no steps were taken to protect these paintings, and in the fifteen years' interval before the Archaeological Survey commenced work at Polonnaruwa, they had faded beyond recognition.\n\nThe first task of the past season's excavation was the removal of the d\u00e9bris which literally choked the entresol, leading on from the vestibule, as well as the shrine itself, up to the top of the walls, which are 25 feet high in places.\n\nThe difficulty of dealing with this immense mass of caked brick and mortar talus, which filled the passage and shrine, rendered the work both slow and dangerous, in view of the crumbling state of the later built inner walls.* Ultimately the whole space was\n\n* A Moor cooly was buried to the neck by the fall of part of a wall.\ncleared without damaging either the frescoes on these screen walls, or what remains of the colossal statue of Buddha (hiti-pilima) which stands erect against the back wall. This immense figure, formed of brick heavily plastered, is headless and had lost its right leg below the knee.*\n\nThe frescoes are full of interest. They depict legendary episodes from the life of Gautama Buddha. The main piece on the south wall shows the \"Tath\u00e1gata,\" stiffly posed in a boat with two rowers, who are admirably represented. Though not so well preserved as the paintings in the \"pockets\" at Sigiri-gala, those found on the walls of \"Demala Mah\u00e1 S\u00e9ya\" yield nothing to the latter in variety and spirited execution. Many of the figures are larger than life-size.\n\nThe extreme flimsiness of the screen walls (clay conglomerate packing, plaster coated) on which the frescoes are painted threatens their rapid disintegration, if not entire destruction. Every effort has, therefore, been made to preserve them for at least some time, in order to secure, before it is too late, copies in oil as far as the worn paintings can be reproduced.\n\nA jungle stick roof, thatched with cadjans, has been thrown across the shrine to shelter it from the north-east monsoon rains.\n\nThe Buddha has also been specially protected by temporarily trussing the figure in a stick \"crate\" with ramba grass. But the image is tottering to its fall, and may not survive long.\n\nCircular Ruin.\n\nAbout a hundred yards south of \"Demala Maha S\u00e9ya\" is a brick ruin, with remains of circular wall. The excavation of this structure (presumed to be a \"Wata-d\u00e1-g\u00e9\" hitherto) has yielded no satisfactory identification at present.\n\nIt has proved to be pillarless, and the walls did not apparently enshrine a d\u00e1gaba, as at the well-known \"Wata-d\u00e1-g\u00e9\" near \"Th\u00fap\u00e1rama\" Vih\u00e1r\u00e9. The diameter within the wall is about 58 ft.\n\nVih\u00e1r\u00e9.\n\nBetween the \"Pabulu Vehera\" (D\u00e1gaba) and the little Hind\u00fa temple of granite sacred to \u015aiva (D\u00e9val\u00e9 No. 2) a mound with crude masses of brickwork was next tried.\n\nExcavation has shown it to be an oblong Vih\u00e1r\u00e9, with vestibule once stoutly columned, and a shrine heavily walled in brick and mortar so as to bear up a vaulted roof. One or two broken images were exhumed here. The floor is laid in lime concrete coloured in a pattern of blue and red framing.\n\n\"Pabulu Vehera.\"\n\nThis is the present-day name of the third in size of the completed D\u00e1gabas of Polonnaruwa. It lies some distance south of the two larger Th\u00fapas and within the City wall.\n\n* The leg was roughly renewed to save, if possible, further dismemberment, or not improbably total fall, of the figure.\nThere are manifest indications of the deliberate destruction of its superstructure (kota and hatar\u0113s k\u014d\u1e6duwa) in the tons of brick d\u00e9bris, mortar bound, now burying the base of the D\u00e1gaba.\n\nSo far only a vih\u0101r\u00e9, hugging its south-west face, has been excavated, simultaneously with the above-mentioned vih\u0101r\u00e9 near the \u015aiva D\u00e9val\u00e9. In its inner sanctuary were found a huge limestone hiti-pilima of the Buddha, fallen headlong, and another figure, with tall head-dress.\n\nMonastery near the North Gate of the City.\n\nClose outside the Northern Gateway through the ancient City wall lie the ruins of a small Monastery, within premises some 50 yards square. This Monastery was excavated thoroughly. The most marked structures are a vih\u0101r\u00e9 and a d\u00e1gaba.\n\nThe vih\u0101r\u00e9 was of the familiar Polonnaruwa plan, with three images (of which the pedestals are in situ) ranged side by side towards the back. Some of the figures were uncovered on the floor\u2014all broken.\n\nThe d\u00e1gaba differs from any yet examined at Polonnaruwa. It stood on a brick-faced ma\u1e37uwa, or platform, 57 ft. four-square, raised 7 ft. 6 in. from ground level, and was reached by a steep flight of granite steps. The stairs are footed by a moonstone and a pair of N\u0101ga dv\u0101rap\u0101las. The revetment of the ma\u1e37uwa is faced in front by a most effective dado of twenty full-faced lions, between pilasters, sharply moulded in brick tiles. The d\u00e1gaba proper had at base a diameter of about 30 ft.; but it has been so mercilessly wrecked that its true outlines are difficult to recast.\n\nTreasure seekers had penetrated into the bell of the d\u00e1gaba by a diagonal shaft, and gutted its garbha, or \"relic chamber,\" which is partially exposed as they left it. This chamber really comprised three cellas, superimposed one above the other, each measuring 3 ft. square nearly, and each containing wall niches for clay saucer lamps. The floor of the uppermost cella was paved by a stone yantra-gala of 25 partitions; the second by a plain slab on which rose a small octagonal pillar, the \"Indra-k\u012bla;\" the third, and lowest, by a second yantra receptacle, but of brick and in 9 divisions.\n\nOf the original deposits in these cellas, the only antiques ignored by the vandals were seven tiny bronze cobras found in two partitions of the bottom yantra receptacle.\n\nCity Wall.\n\nThe City wall to the west has been laid bare, inside and out, where the main road from Minn\u00e9riya twice cuts through it.\n\nRuins within T\u00f3p\u00e1v\u0113wa Tank.\n\nNot far west of where an ancient horowwa (sluice) of T\u00f3p\u00e1v\u0113wa tank pierces the bund, occur four isolated ruins.\nD\u00e9val\u00e9s.\n\nFurthest north are the remains of a pair of Hind\u00fa fanes. The larger of the two showed the familiar plan of a d\u00e9val\u00e9 containing three apartments, a front hall, vestibule, and the innermost chamber. The bottom of the walls alone survives. The argha slab (its lingam is missing), unearthed in the middle of the adytum, fixes the cult as that of Siva.\n\nThe other ruin is no more than a small chamber, walled by well-dressed granite slabs, with a pilla (spout) projecting. It once formed the sanctuary of some k\u00f3vil, of which nothing more exists at this day.\n\nD\u00e1gaba.\n\nSouth of these Hind\u00fa shrines a jungle-covered mound about 20 ft. in height was opened late in the season. This finally gave proof of having once served as a d\u00e1gaba. The hatares kotuwa (square tee) has wholly disappeared, but a large portion of the tapering kota, or pinnacle, with 23 of its concentric rings intact, was unearthed on the slope of the mound where it must have fallen when the d\u00e1gaba was destroyed centuries ago.\n\nThe d\u00e1gaba was apparently somewhat over 50 ft. in diameter, and touched tangentially at the cardinal points a square stereobate. Faint outlines of an outer maluwa about 80 ft. square are traceable.\n\nIt is not surprising to find that this d\u00e1gaba, like the smaller one near the North Gate of the City, had not escaped rifling by Southern Indian aliens.\n\nA breach had been made into the top of the bell to a depth of nearly 12 ft., uncovering two cellas. In the first a series of stone pillar-slabs (including the \"Indra-k\u00edla\") were found fallen into the relic chamber, owing to the breach. This topmost cella had been quite denuded of all its contents save a single coin of S\u00e1hasa Malla (1200-1202 A.D.)\n\nFollowing the breach lower down, about half of a brick yantra receptacle was unearthed, with 16 (of the full 25) partitions unbroken. The rest had evidently been destroyed and their contents appropriated.\n\nFrom the surviving divisions an extraordinarily varied set of miniature bronzes\u2014gods, animals, reptiles, and implements\u2014were taken out.\n\nTo ascertain the sectional construction of the d\u00e1gaba, it was decided to sink a shaft below these breached relic chambers down to ground level. A further series of most interesting arch\u00e6ological articles came to light at different depths.\n\nBelow the broken yantra receptacle\u2014doubtless the bottom of the second cella\u2014a third cella, in size a cube of 3 ft., was struck. This contained the most important \"find\" of all\u2014a squared pedestal of limestone (1 ft. 8 in. by 9\u00bd in.), with seven horizontal ribs (probably to represent Mount Maha M\u00e9ru) and splayed at top pyramidically. This pedestal (of which three sides respectively still show traces of red, yellow, and white colouring\u2014with blue, red, yellow, and white on the fourth side and top) stood on three small detached supports as tripod. It was crowned\nby a beautifully modelled kara\u1e47\u1e0duwa of beaten gold, 3 in. high, shaped like a diminutive d\u0101gaba. The kara\u1e47\u1e0duwa contained seventeen small gems of no intrinsic value.\n\nUnderneath this third chamber lay a nine-holed yantra receptacle of brick, each partition of which produced a brood of cobras, a mother and four young, in bronze, or 45 n\u0101gas in all.\n\nBelow this again were found more valueless gems mingled with sand and lime mortar. Finally, a copper plate (once probably inscribed but now so corroded as to yield no trace of writing), a coin or two, and a chank resting on a tripod.*\n\nM\u0101lig\u0101wa.\n\nThe last of the three sites attacked within T\u014dpav\u0113wa tank was a widespread mound covered with tall forest trees. It is situated within sight of the Promontory lying south-east.\n\nThe lower portion of the mound is rubble-banked with relap\u0101na, or rubble pitching, as breakwater protection against the wavelets of the tank which once lapped it.\n\nWhen the trees had been cut and d\u00e9bris removed from the summit of the mound an extensive single structure steadily developed its ground plan, as its walls and cross walls were gradually unearthed.\n\nFurther, it became more and more evident that the structure was purely secular\u2014without doubt a m\u0101lig\u0101wa or residence of some chieftain, if not of royalty.\n\nNo stone was used in the construction of this palace, or mansion, and comparatively little brick. Walls, floor, steps, all are of clay and lime concrete, thickly encased in, or overlaid with, lime plaster. The walls still stand from 3 to 5 ft. in height, showing most clearly the internal arrangement of corridors and rooms.\n\nAccess could be gained to the building only by a staircase in the middle of the north face, rising to a bay portico and landings, from which three gangways diverged and completely encircled the structure. At the back (south) there is another bay, from which steps descended, not directly but westward, on to the rubble-faced platform.\n\nEntering the building from the front, the first chamber is a spacious hall, nearly 39 by 32 ft. in dimensions, the front portion of which was once supported on 24 wooden pillars. There was passage directly through this hall to an elongated room of the same breadth, but only 6 ft. 6 in. in depth. This again leads into a verandah, 9 ft. 4 in. wide at the back, by barely 6 ft. 5 in. along the flanks of the hall and narrow room which it also skirts. The hall admitted into this verandah through cramped side openings. The verandah at the east was bare, and from it stairs originally mounted to upper storeys, which must have been entirely of wooden construction.\n\nThe corresponding verandah on the west contained a lavatory, cut off by a cross wall, but accessible from the back verandah.\n\n* All these \"finds\" will be deposited in the Colombo Museum.\nThe walls of chambers and verandah still show openings where windows were placed at intervals. Vertical holes in the walls point to some eighty stout posts being engaged in them (to add strength), in addition to the twenty-four pillars in the hall which were free standing.\n\nThe floor is laid with a thick coating of lime plaster, no doubt formerly coloured in a red and blue carpet design, for on the walls are still to be seen portions of a dado\u2014a brilliant red framing. The whole structure\u2014chambers, verandah, and three gangways\u2014covered an area of 84 feet square.\n\nThe only \"finds\" made were a small killotaya, or chunam box, still containing lime probably six centuries old, a coin of S\u00e1hasa Malla, and a skull which crumbled to the touch.\n\n3.\u2014Restoration.\n\n\"Th\u00edp\u00e1r\u00e1ma\" Vih\u00e1r\u00e9.\u2014The work of filling in the many and dangerous cracks in the walls and roofs of the shrine and vestibule, and the rebuilding, where necessary, of the doubtful inset arch at the doorway into the shrine, was completed by the end of the 1908 season.\n\nLast year, therefore, it was safe to turn attention to the square duplicated tower.\n\nThe soffit of the vaulted roof of the shrine was first pointed to ensure greater stability.\n\nThe cleaning of the tower, prior to dealing with its cracks, disclosed that it had formerly been gutted from the top, in the expectation of finding treasure, and the breach subsequently refilled with loose d\u00e9bris. All is now set right; the tower has been rendered quite impervious to rain, and the countless abrasions and pittings in its wall and roof roughly mended to save further rapid weathering.\n\nThe flat roof of the shrine was relaid in cement concrete in 1908.\n\nLast season the \"weepholes\" through the parapet (which of old merely allowed rain water to run down and wear away the wall face of the building) were corbelled out as bracket spouting, so as to ensure the drainage being thrown clear of the basement plinth.\n\nWata-d\u00e1-g\u00e9.\u2014The pavement of the inner and upper maluwa surrounding the central d\u00e1gaba (within the brick wall) was taken up and laid with a radiating slope.\n\nWith no roof to shelter the d\u00e1gaba and its circular maluwa, now that the concentric rings of tall granite columns no longer stand, the space became virtually converted during wet weather into a shallow tank with no egress for the water.\n\nA conduit has now been cut, through both its granite plinths (outer and inner) and the brick wall, in the middle of each quadrant, to pass off water from inside to the exterior maluwa, whence existing gargoyles discharge it on to the ground. The pavement surrounding the d\u00e1gaba will in future, therefore, be always rapidly drained.\nIII.\u2014Sigiriya.\n\n1.\u2014Clearing.\n\nThe annual clearing of scrub within the enceinte of \"Sigiri Nuwara\" was carried out.\n\n2.\u2014Restoration.\n\nIn 1908, the western half of the \"Lion-staircase house\" at the foot of the ladders leading to the summit of the Rock was refaced strongly in stepped masonry, cement-pointed, as a protection against further wash from rain water falling over the Rock.\n\nLast season the east side of the structure was similarly renewed. Attention was then given to the South Approach to the \"gallery.\" The upper flights of steps on this Approach were excavated in 1895, and subsequently restored partially by adding continuous retaining and half walls on the off side.\n\nBut of the lower tiers, which had been long ago washed down the slope of the hill, nothing remained; and, to render the South Approach traversable from end to end, it was necessary to rebuild these. Before the last season's work at Sigiriya closed in April, three staircases and landings were partially constructed, almost uniting the upper flights of steps with the broad terrace below from which the original staircase ascent was made.\n\nSimultaneously, a broad stairway of rubble stone, set in mortar, was erected from the tank bund, at the foot of the hill, as far as the terrace on which the Archaeological Survey Camp is placed.\n\nAnother season's work should see the junction of these stone and brick stairs effected, by the building of one or two short intermediate flights of steps and the levelling of the pathway along intervening terraces. It will then be possible to reach the \"gallery\" and gain the top of Sigiri-gala by a succession of staircases the whole way from the driving road at the foot of the ascent to the hill.\n\n\u015aiva D\u00e9val\u00e9 No. 2.\n\nThe vestibule of this chaste Hind\u00fa shrine, which threatened to fall unless promptly rebuilt, was wholly dismantled, and has been well reset.\n\nThe shrine walls have opened out in places, and with the dome need more attention than had been anticipated. These will be seen to next season.\n\nIV.\u2014Epigraphical Work.\n\nPart IV. of the \"Epigraphia Zeylanica\" appeared early in 1909. Mr. Wickremasinghe is believed to have Part V. in hand.\n\nEye-copying and securing ink \"squeezes\" of the lithic records of the Island was steadily continued last year. The inscriptions of the North-Western Province are now being gradually collected.\n\nIt has been decided by the Government that all \"estampages\" of Ceylon inscriptions are, after being photographed, to be stored\nat the Colombo Museum for the benefit of the students of the palaeography and ancient language of the Island as deducible from its cave rock, slab, and pillar records.\n\nCOUNCIL.\n\nUnder Rule 16 Messrs. C. Drieberg and R. G. Anthonisz had to retire by seniority, and the Hon. Mr. S. C. Obeyesekere and the Hon. Mr. Justice A. Wood Renton by least attendance, but two of these gentlemen being eligible for re-election, Messrs. R. G. Anthonisz and C. Drieberg were re-elected, and the vacancies in the Council were filled by the appointment of Messrs. E. B. Denham and M. Kelway Bamber.\n\nThe vacancy caused by the death of Mr. J. Parsons was filled by the appointment of Mr. D. B. Jayatilaka, and that caused by the death of Mr. C. M. Fernando was filled by the appointment of the Hon. Mr. H. L. Crawford, C.M.G.\n\nPRESIDENTSHIP.\n\nThe vacancy caused by the resignation of the Hon. Mr. John Ferguson, C.M.G., was filled by the appointment of Sir Hugh Clifford, K.C.M.G., who was Vice-Patron of the Society the previous year.\n\nFINANCES.\n\nAnnexed (see page 58) is a balance sheet, showing the expenditure and receipts for 1909.\n\n12. Dr. Nell proposed the adoption of the Report which, he said, was very gratifying. It showed an increase in the number of Members, and it was interesting to note that a good number of Civil Servants were joining the Society. The Society is now as flourishing as it was 25 years ago.\n\n13. Mr. Roles seconded and, as a former Treasurer, congratulated the Society on its substantial balance.\n\n14. The Chairman thought the Report was, on the whole, satisfactory, not only in the direction indicated by Dr. Nell, but also from the point of view of the finances of the Society, which at any rate at the present moment, were thoroughly sound.\n\nThe Report was then adopted.\n\nOFFICE-BEARERS.\n\n15. The Chairman pointed out that he would be away from the Island from the end of the ensuing month till next year, and stated that in these circumstances he thought it altogether undesirable that he should be re-elected President.\n\n16. Mr. Harward said that at a Meeting of the Council it had been unanimously decided to ask Sir Hugh Clifford to retain his position as President. Other Presidents absent from the Island on furlough had retained the position and resumed the duties on returning, and he thought he was not going too far in saying that\n## Balance Sheet for 1909.\n\n### RECEIPTS.\n\n| Description                  | Amount | Total |\n|------------------------------|--------|-------|\n| Balance from 1908            | \u2014      | 260 76|\n| Life Membership Payments     | \u2014      | 75 0  |\n| Entrance Fees                | \u2014      | 194 25|\n| Government Grant             | \u2014      | 500 0 |\n| Annual Subscriptions:        |        |       |\n| 1901\u20131905                    | \u2014      | 73 50 |\n| 1906                         | \u2014      | 31 50 |\n| 1907                         | \u2014      | 148 50|\n| 1908                         | \u2014      | 335 0 |\n| 1909                         | \u2014      | 1,380 0|\n| 1910                         | \u2014      | 77 6  |\n| Sale of Publications         | \u2014      | 34 88 |\n| Rs. 1,260.85 on Deposit Account with interest at 3\u00bd per cent. for twelve months | \u2014 | 1,304 97|\n\nTotal .. 4,415 42\n\n### EXPENDITURE.\n\n| Description                  | Amount | Total |\n|------------------------------|--------|-------|\n| Printing Account             | \u2014      | 1,862 16|\n| Charges Account              | \u2014      | 435 10 |\n| Books Account                | \u2014      | 13 40 |\n| Salaries Account             | \u2014      | 938 26 |\n| Postage Account              | \u2014      | 215 0 |\n| Balance to 1910 in Bank of Madras | \u2014 | 951 50 |\n\nTotal .. 4,415 42\n\nGERARD A. JOSEPH,\nHonorary Treasurer.\nat no period within his memory had the Society been more prosperous than during the short Presidency of Sir Hugh Clifford. He thought he was expressing the wishes of all in hoping that the Chairman would reconsider his decision.\n\n17. The Chairman said he was very sensible of the honour they had done him, but his own strong opinion in the matter was that the President of the Society should be present in the Colony, and should be an active force both on the Council and at the Meetings of the Society. It seemed to him that to elect any person President a few weeks before his departure from the Colony, when during the remainder of the current year he could not, humanly speaking, be in it, was not to do quite full justice to the Society and not to fill the Presidential chair in a way that was likely to serve the Society\u2019s best interests.\n\n18. Being further urged the Chairman said he did not wish to press his objection, and the office-bearers were then, on the motion of Mr. E. W. Jayewardene, seconded by Dr. C. A. Hewawitarena, elected as follows:\n\nPresident.\u2014The Hon. Sir Hugh Clifford, K.C.M.G.\n\nVice-Presidents.\u2014The Hon. Messrs. J. P. Lewis and P. Arun\u00e1chalam, Dr. A.

Mr. Roles inquired the date of Mr. Lewis\u2019s departure.\n\nThe Chairman said that it was the same as his own, but he gathered that the Council put forward his name as a Vice-President out of compliment to so learned, distinguished, and useful a Member.\n\nVote of Thanks.\n\n20.

The Chairman, before proceeding with the business of the Meeting, addressed the Meeting in regard to the death of King Edward VII.\n\nThe first business to-day is in connection with the great and sudden calamity which has fallen on us since we last met. In the absence of the President, Sir Hugh Clifford, from the Island, it falls to me as Vice-President to submit for your acceptance a resolution, which I would ask you to pass in solemn silence.\n\nThe loss we deplore is of no ordinary sovereign. In the discharge of the duties of his exalted station, His late Majesty won the respect, love, and devotion of all his subjects. They knew that their welfare was his highest aim, and that for it he worked with unceasing toil. Up to his last breath he remained steadfast and true to that ideal of service which shone so long on his crest as Prince of Wales: *Ich dien.* His memory will be enshrined in the hearts of a grateful people. Well would it be for us if we strove, each in his sphere, to keep that ideal before us. It was the privilege of this Society to be linked to his gracious personality as Patron of our parent Society. His Majesty's lively interest in art, science, and literature was well known, and was manifested in the active encouragement and support of numerous institutions throughout the Empire for their advancement. Above all, the British Academy, which he founded, will be an enduring testimony to his patronage of literature. By his\nsuccessful efforts in the promotion of international harmony and goodwill he laid the whole world under his debt, and was universally hailed as the Great Peacemaker; and what nobler title can there be to the remembrance of posterity?\n\nTo that Gracious Lady, the widowed Queen, in her affliction, our thoughts have daily turned ever since the sad news was flashed to us by the wires, and we pray that God in His goodness may give her strength to bear her sorrow. King Edward and Queen Alexandra have always seemed very near to us in Ceylon. His Majesty honoured the Island with a visit extending over many days in 1875, and captivated the hearts of all. The links then formed were renewed and strengthened when Their Majesties sent their two beloved sons, still in their teens, among us in the year 1882, and later their present Majesties in 1901. Our Island was thus specially favoured among the King\u2019s dominions.\n\nHis late Majesty\u2019s interest and attachment to Ceylon was shared by all the Royal Family. This was brought home to me in a striking manner in the winter of 1904, when Mrs. Arun\u00e1chalam and I were in England, and Her Majesty Queen Alexandra was graciously pleased to honour us with a private audience at Buckingham Palace. Impressed as we were\u2014and who is not?\u2014by the Queen\u2019s marvellous beauty and gracious manner, we were scarcely less impressed by the interest manifested in this Island and its people and the concern for their welfare\u2014an interest so deep that Her Majesty expressed her disappointment that it had not been possible for her to accompany the King to Ceylon in 1875, but Her Majesty still hoped to pay the Island a visit. The happiness of welcoming Her Gracious Majesty among us can now be scarcely hoped for. But should that good fortune be granted to us, no need to say that the Queen Mother is assured of a universal welcome of the most loyal affection and devotion. It is impossible for any formal words to express our grief at the close of so great and beneficent a career as that of His late Majesty and our sympathy with the widowed Queen. But such as it is, I ask you to pass this resolution and to authorize the Honorary Secretary to forward it to His Excellency the Governor for submission to His Majesty the King and the Queen Mother.\n\nThe following vote of condolence was passed in solemn silence, all Members standing.\n\nResolved,\u2014\u201cTo place on record the grief of this Society and its sense of the profound loss sustained by the British Empire, and by the world of art, science, and literature, by the death of His Majesty King Edward VII., Patron of the Parent Society, and to submit the same with our humble condolence to His Majesty King George V., the Queen Mother, and the Royal Family.\u201d\n\n3.

Resolved,\u2014That a General Meeting be held early in July, and that the date and the business be left in the hands of the Secretaries and Vice-President.\nHier leyt begraven\nJuff.

Read and confirmed Minutes of last General Meeting held on March 16, 1910.\n\n2. The following Resolution which had been passed at a Meeting of the Council of the Society was notified to the General Meeting:\u2014\"To place on record the grief of this Society and its sense of the profound loss sustained by the Empire and by the world of Art, Science, and Literature by the death of His Majesty King Edward VII., Patron of the parent Society, and to submit the same with our humble condolence to His Majesty King George V., the Queen-Mother, and the Royal Family.\"\n\n3. A further Resolution passed by the Council was also notified:\u2014\"To express the Society's appreciation of the valuable services rendered by Mr. A. Willey, M.A., D.Sc., F.R.S., to it as Vice-President, and to the cause of Science in Ceylon as Director of\nthe Colombo Museum, and its great regret at the severance of his connection with Ceylon. It is recommended to the Society that Dr. Willey be elected an Honorary Member for life under Rule 7.\u201d\n\nThe recommendations of the Council were adopted by the Meeting.\n\n4. The Chairman moved\u2014\u201cThat this Society desires to record its profound regret at the death of Mr. Donald W. Ferguson, and its appreciation of the very valuable services rendered by him to the Society and to historical research in Ceylon, and to express its deep sympathy with his family.\u201d\n\nIn doing so Mr. Arun\u00e1chalam said: \u201cIt is my sad duty to announce to the Society the death of one of its most valued members\u2014Mr. Donald Ferguson. He belonged to a family which has for almost a century been identified with Ceylon, and has laid the Island under many obligations. He began life as a journalist on the staff of his father\u2019s paper, the Ceylon Observer, and rose to be one of its editors.\n\nFollowing the tradition of his cousin, Mr. John Ferguson, who was till recently our President, and of a great journalistic figure in the past, Mr. John Capper, of the Ceylon Times, who was for many years our indefatigable Secretary, Mr. Donald Ferguson did not confine himself to journalism, but entered with zest into literary work, of which our Society reaped a good harvest.\n\nCompelled by ill-health to leave Ceylon, he settled down in Croydon and devoted himself with undiminished ardour to his favourite literary pursuits, chiefly the history and antiquities of Ceylon. The quantity and quality of his work, which would have been great for a person in vigorous health, were truly surprising when one remembers the conditions under which that work was produced.\n\nHe was a man of varied and profound research, master of many languages, ancient and modern\u2014perhaps the greatest linguist on the roll of our Members. There was scarcely a branch of Ceylon history or antiquities in which his opinion was not listened to with attention and respect.\n\nBut the field which he made specially his own was the Portuguese and Dutch period of Ceylon history, and especially the Portuguese period. No Member has made more numerous or more valuable contributions to our journal. I hold in my hand a long list of those contributions. The most important of them was the translation which he undertook for our Society of \u201cBarros and de Couto\u2019s History of Ceylon,\u201d and completed with exhaustive notes, receiving the well-merited thanks of the Society.\n\nHe laboured for us and thought of us to the end. Not long ago he presented this Society with a precious MS. copy of \u201cRibeiro\u2019s Ceylon,\u201d which had been used by Abbe le Grand in making his translation. A Paper which was recently received from him on the \u201cEarliest Dutch Visits to Ceylon\u201d will shortly appear in our Journal. When his doctors had given up hopes of his recovery, he wrote a pathetic note, expressing his regret that he would not live to complete other tasks he had set himself.\nHe was indeed a rare type of scholar. His life should be an example and a stimulus to us all, and his memory will be cherished with gratitude by this Society. I am sure I am echoing the unanimous views of the Society in desiring to place on record our appreciation of his services, the sense of our loss, and our sympathy with his bereaved family.\n\nBefore submitting the formal motion, I venture to express the hope that his valuable collection of books and MSS. will not be dispersed, and that it may please the Ceylon Government to acquire it for the Island.\n\n5. The motion was seconded by Dr. A. Nell, supported by Mr. P. E. Morgappah, and carried.\n\n6. The Secretary next announced that the following gentlemen had been elected to Membership in the Society since the last Meeting:\u2014Messrs. C. A. Davis; C. V. Brayne, B.A., C.C.S.; C. M. Lushington, C.C.S.; T. A. Abdul Raheem; J. O'Kane Murty, C.C.S.; R. B. Strickland, M.A.; D. A. Wickramasinghe; J. A. Vareey; and J. E. Rode.\n\n7. Mr. Joseph read the following Paper by Mr. John Still:\u2014\nTANTRI-MALAI:\n\nSome Archaeological Observations and Deductions.\n\nBy John Still.*\n\n*Tantri-malai* is the name now given to a wilderness of rocks situated about two miles west of the Malwatu-oya and about twenty miles due north-west of Anur\u00e1dhapura. For many centuries the place has been abandoned, and although it was at one time an important monastery, with perhaps an adjacent town, at the present day its very name is lost.\n\nDespite its situation in quite uninhabited country, and on the edge of one of the largest stretches of wild forest in the northern half of the Island, Tantri-malai has been frequently visited. A notice of it appears in Mr. Parker's recent book, \"Ancient Ceylon\" (pp. 244\u20135), and a fuller account in the Archaeological Commissioner's Annual Report for 1896.\u2020\n\nMr. Bell, on his visit in October, 1896, encountered the stormy rainy weather which usually ushers in the north-east monsoon in that part of the country; and of the other visitors, most, if not all, made but short stay at the rock. It, therefore, happens that I am able to record a certain amount that is new, for I spent a week there, living in a cave and devoting my whole time to exploration of the rocks.\n\nThe rocks of Tantri-malai differ from those tumbled labyrinths the ancient Sinhalese most usually chose for their early monasteries. They are less a collection of boulders than a huge series of frozen waves of stone, separated one from another by narrow gullies full of jungle and tangle and thorns. Owing to this formation there are fewer caves than usual, and in consequence fewer inscriptions; for the earliest inscriptions were generally cut on the brows of caves.\n\nBroadly speaking the rocks divide into two groups, with a sinuous stretch of grass land between them, which at its\n\n* Mr. Still served as Assistant to the Archaeological Commissioner from January 1, 1902, to December 31, 1907.\u2014B., Ed. Sec.\n\n\u2020 A footnote to page 7 of this Report gives a list of other accounts of Tantri-malai in diaries of Civil Servants. See Appendix B.\u2014B., Ed. Sec.\nlower\u2014southern\u2014end widens out into a little tank formed by an embankment thrown from rock to rock. At the time of my visit (December, 1909) this intervening grass land was a rather swampy meadow, the favourite haunt of wild buffaloes. But in the days when the monastery flourished it too must have been submerged by the waters of the tank. With the large area of non-absorbent rock to collect and transmit the rain, it is probable that a very considerable population might have subsisted by means of this reservoir; always supposing, of course, that no water was drawn off for irrigation purposes, and of this there is no indication in the way of either sluice or channel. In this dry land, and remote from the river, water conservance was of the first importance, and I am inclined to attribute an early date to this little reservoir.\n\nBut the history of Tantri-malai goes back far beyond the tank\u2014at least I think so\u2014and it seems to me that in its various remains we can read of four different ages of occupation, ending in tragic abandonment. It may be that in this I have tried to see too much in the stones and their record; but the evidence, such as it is, forms the subject of this Paper, and those who cannot accept the conclusions may perhaps form others from the observations.\n\n1.\u2014Earliest Period.\n\nIn the south-eastern quarter of the area of rocks there stands a boulder, which by its overhanging sides forms a shelter convenient alike to man and beast. At the present day it is obviously the den of beasts, and in it are bones which show it has been used by leopards.\n\nBut in prehistoric times it must have been the refuge of human beings, for in it I found chipped fragments of chert and a piece of crystal. These were not in any sense implements, but they may have been the waste chips thrown away while implements were being made. For they are of material quite foreign to their surroundings, such as could hardly have come to be where they were by accident. Of their age, I am quite incompetent to form even an estimate; but to their newness I can put a limit\u2014the limit is 2,000 years ago. The cave where they were found has a drip-ledge\ncut along its face; but it bears no inscription. However, from other inscriptions which will be given later, it is clear that a monastery existed in the Tantri-malai caves about 100 years before Christ, and it is permissible to believe that this cave was occupied at much the same date.\n\nThe floor of the cave in monastic times was rudely paved with uncut pieces of flat stone, and some ten inches of earth intervened between this and the bed-rock floor. It was on the rock floor that these chips were found. They may be later than I think, but the earth above them and below the pavement held nothing, not even fragments of brick or pottery; so I think they must be very early. If they had been found all about the cave and at a more modern level they might be taken to be fire-strikers of early Sinhalese date; but there were no other fragments of similar stone, and these were alone nearly a foot below the old paved floor. The only other objects found at this lowest level were two pieces of what is apparently a fresh-water shell. These results are slender; but there are several other caves which might yield more if carefully excavated, especially those at \u00c1ndiy\u00e1-gala, about three miles south of Tantri-malai.\n\n2.\u2014First Buddhist Monastery.\n\nWhen the fine eagerness of early Buddhist zeal led monks and nuns to seek out restful solitudes throughout Ceylon, they very often chose for themselves homes among the rocks. Apart from the history literature affords, all that we know of the early monasteries has been gathered from caves, buildings, and inscriptions on rocks. Throughout the Island, and especially in the northern plain, there are scores of such monasteries. It is hardly an exaggeration to say that in the North-Central Province and the Wanni nearly every considerable rock outcrop shows some trace of early occupation. Probably it was the water holes they contain which led people to occupy them, for a great many of these rocks contain deep narrow pools which hold a supply of drinking water throughout the dry weather\u2014in many cases the only available drinking water for several miles. This water and the shelter of their caves formed their attraction.\nAt Tantri-malai, as in so many other places, the first settlement of which we have any definite record was a Buddhist monastery founded in the early centuries B.C. To support this view there are three inscriptions,* two of the second or first century B.C., and one perhaps a hundred years more modern. None of these have been published before, but the first was copied by Mr. Bell in 1896. It consists of eleven letters cut\n\n\\[ \\text{Ba ra ta pi da ha ti sa te ra ha} \\]\n\nin the rock just above one of the best of the natural cisterns, and reads \"Ba ra ta pi da ha ti sa te ra ha.\" As stated above, the letters are of early form, and may be as old as the second century B.C. \"Baratapida\" may be a name; in which case the record would read \"[that which] belongs to Baratapida and the monk Tissa\"; or \"Barata\" may be a name, and pi da perhaps derived from pudanav\u00e1, to offer.\n\nThe next record, of about the same date, is cut in the rock by the side of a long cave about 60 yards to the east of the last inscription. It is low down at the east end of the cave.\n\n\\[ \\text{A ti a ji ri ya ba ti} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{ya ma ta u pa si ka na ga ya} \\]\n\nIt reads \"A ti a ji ri ya ba ti ya ma ta u pa si ka na ga ya,\"\n\n* See Appendix B.\u2014B., Ed. Sec.\nand possibly a few more letters now obliterated. The earlier part of it is beyond me; but from the latter half it is plain that the cave was once the abode of a lady named N\u00e1ga, who had devoted herself to religion.\n\nThe last inscription of approximately this period is cut in the rock above a small natural cistern about 150 yards north-north-east of Up\u00e1sik\u00e1 Naga\u2019s cave.\n\n\\[ \\text{Ba ta su ma na ha ta la cha da} \\]\n\nJudging by the shapes of the sa, ma, and ha, this belongs to about the time of Christ. It reads \u201cBa ta su ma na ha ta la cha da,\u201d and appears to be complete. Bata Sumana may be taken equally to mean \u201cBrother Sumana,\u201d or to be a single name; but what his talachada may have been I am not able to explain; tala could possibly be read tal\u00e9, which means the blade of any sharp instrument, and the record may be simply that Bata Sumana cut his name.\n\nBeside these three definite date-fixing records, there are several other remnants of the early monastery.\n\nProbably the first monk or devotee who settled there lived in the fine natural cave, afterwards the cell of Up\u00e1sik\u00e1 Naga; but as the community grew, further accommodation had to be provided, and perhaps the cave where the chert flakes were found, and two others near to it, were then occupied. All three have drip ledges cut above their brows, but none bear inscriptions.\n\nI attribute to the same period a number of small stone buildings which occur almost at random on quite a number of the rocks. These are in most instances close to some natural cistern, which leads me to believe that they existed before the construction of the tank. There are about twelve of these buildings in all, each built of rough stone fragments which show no wedge marks and which seem to have been naturally fractured. I call them buildings, but as a fact they are no more than little rectangular platforms with no\nsteps or entrances of any kind. Their sides are formed of large rough stones laid in straight rows, and within the space thus formed they are filled up with stone rubble. Some contain brick d\u00e9bris, others do not, but possibly it may have all been washed away. The four sides of these platforms face approximately the four cardinal points, though in all cases their north is 20 or 30 degrees west of the north, as my compass gives it. They must have been the sites of buildings of some sort, but it is hard to imagine their exact nature: they can hardly have contained much brickwork, for almost all traces of brick have disappeared: they probably were not tiled, for I did not find even a single fragment of tile. It is therefore fairly certain that they were built of wood. Their length from north to south, as a rule, slightly exceeds their width from east to west, and in all cases they were small. I measured several, with the results given below: 16 ft. by 13 ft.; 18 ft. by 15 ft.; 18 ft. by 17 ft.; 15 ft. by 15 ft. From their ruined state measurements must be only approximations.\n\nOf the earliest monastery, we have, therefore, the following traces:\u2014One large natural cave, spacious enough to shelter thirty people at least, with an inscription of the first or second century B.C.; an adjacent natural cistern, with an inscription of the same period; another natural cistern, with a rather later inscription; and a number of small rudely built stone platforms, once the sites of buildings in which the stones were collected, not quarried, for they bear no wedge marks; also three lean-to caves beneath boulders in which are no inscriptions, but which have cut drip-ledges.\n\n3.\u2014First Post Christian Monastery.\n\nOf the next period, the most important item is the d\u00e1gaba which stands on the apex of the largest and highest rock. From its bricks Mr. Parker (\"Ancient Ceylon,\" page 244) supposed this d\u00e1gaba to belong to the second century or early first century B.C. If he is correct, then the d\u00e1gaba must be added to the description already given of the first monastery; but, for several reasons, I am inclined to disassociate the\nd\u00e1gaba from the early buildings I have described. Firstly, the stonework round about the d\u00e1gaba all shows wedge marks, i.e., it was quarried stone, but that of all the little buildings was not quarried; secondly, the three inscriptions are all remote from the d\u00e1gaba and in the other group of rocks; thirdly, the bricks in and around the d\u00e1gaba, although chipped and broken, still retain their form, while those in the buildings on the rocks are so destroyed and washed that their d\u00e9bris is almost indistinguishable, and it was not possible from any fragment I observed even to tell that it had had straight sides or angles.\n\nFor these reasons I am inclined to believe that the d\u00e1gaba is of later date than the other buildings described, and I would prefer to place it with the few buildings on the rock below it on the eastern side. Here there are not only wedged stone pillars, in which the oval wedge marks correspond both in size and in their intervals with those in the wedged stones around the d\u00e1gaba, but there are also abundance of brick fragments which still to some degree retain their form. Still further to connect these buildings with the d\u00e1gaba, there is the fact of their position, grouped upon either side of the steps which lead to the d\u00e1gaba and to nowhere else.\n\nNow, the first described buildings were in nearly every case placed just beside a rock cistern, sometimes one on either side of it. These other buildings, larger, less ruined, and containing quarried stone, are not near any such water hole, but are close to the tank. It appears therefore that the tank was by this time the source of water supply. So from a tiny settlement we can trace the monastery's growth until there were stone-pillared buildings, a d\u00e1gaba,* and a tank.\n\nIt is interesting to note that from the summit of the d\u00e1gaba rock several of the great d\u00e1gabas of Anur\u00e1dhapura can be plainly seen on a clear morning, without the aid of a glass: J\u00e9tawan\u00e1r\u00e1ma and Abhayagiri stand out distinctly. It is\n\n* At this ruined d\u00e1gaba I found a brick bearing a design of two lotus flowers. Almost similar bricks were found at Aluthalmill\u00e9wa, near Padawiya tank, by the Archaeological Survey in 1891 at a d\u00e1gaba, with an inscription of king Wasabha, who reigned in the later half of the first century A.D. See Annual Report, Archaeological Survey, 1891, p. 10.\nvery hard to believe that the names of such great landmarks could get mixed, and that their identity can have been ever forgotten, as Mr. Parker supposes. The Mah\u00e1 S\u00e9ya D\u00e1gaba on Mihintal\u00e9 kanda, full four and twenty miles away, is also plain to see.\n\n4.\u2014Last Monastery on Tantri-malai.\n\nThe last and greatest monastery of Tantri-malai ended in a tragedy. As we have not succeeded in discovering the ancient name of this place, we cannot trace its history, but tragedy, catastrophe, and sudden flight, or death, are plain to see in its archaeology.\n\nUpon the rock which the d\u00e1gaba crowns there is an image of Buddha, and below it another.\n\nThe former is a sedent figure carved from the rock in high relief, seated upon a throne, with lions carved on the panels. The figure faces to the north and looks towards the d\u00e1gaba. From almost its very feet there started a grand flight of broad low steps cut in the face of the rock, and designed to lead to the d\u00e1gaba; but they were never used. Their edges are as sharp as when the mason left them; eight steps are finished, and half of the ninth. Then came calamity.\n\nOn either side of the great sedent image, 8 ft. high upon his throne, the artist had designed four panels, each to contain a smaller sedent image some 3 ft. high. All of the eight panels, four on either side, are traced in the stone, but not one is finished. One has been roughly blocked out, another has been carved almost to the semblance of a man, others are hardly commenced, as they were on that evil day the craftsman left them.\n\nTo the north of the d\u00e1gaba, at the foot of the rock, an enormous image of Buddha was carved in the side of the hill. As he lies he is 40 feet long, but he was never finished. The work was very nearly done, but not quite.\n\nTo the south-west of the d\u00e1gaba, in the forest, is a stock of wedged pillars and coping stones. They lie where they were quarried, but they were never taken to their places. One long stone has a beaded edge cut with great care, but it was never used.\nIt is as plain as any written history could be. It is an instance of the true value of archaeology as a stimulus to the imagination. In what is now a solemn jungle there must have been a tragedy. Tantri-malai lies right in the track from Mann\u00e1r to Anur\u00e1dhapura; and it was at Mann\u00e1r that the Tamil invaders used to land, and to Anur\u00e1dhapura that they used to march.\n\nIt remains to find out the date of these great images. Mr. Parker places them, and indeed the whole of Tantri-malai, in the second or first century B.C., or at the latest in the first century A.D. Mr. Bell, Archaeological Commissioner, attributes them to the time of Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu the Great, in the twelfth century A.D. Fortune placed in my way the means of deciding this wide difference of opinion; for I found an inscription which seems to settle the point.\n\nOn a rock adjacent to that on which the d\u00e1gaba and great images are, there are three buildings which by their more modern style and infinitely superior preservation palpably belong to a period quite distinct from that of the other ruins.\n\nOne is a square building on a rock, having a circumambient verandah of broad dressed slabs of stone; another is a chamber hewn from the rock and walled up in front with cut and dressed stone; and the third is a little box-like structure on the summit of the rock in which the cave is hewn. Its stonework resembles that in the cave below, and is neat work adorned by slight pilasters in relief. Mr. Bell in his Report appropriately calls it a \"campanile,\" adding its traditional name, Pot-gula, or \"library.\"\n\nThese three buildings are quite obviously of the same date and style. From the evidences of sudden cessation of work, never afterwards resumed, and especially from the half-cut steps, it may be confidently assumed that no important stone work was undertaken at Tantri-malai subsequent to the dispersal of the masons. The images cannot therefore be of earlier date than the three buildings just described, for these exhibit much skill in stone work, and the hewing out of a rock chamber with a cubical content of 1,170 ft. (22 ft. 7 in. by 8 ft. by 6 ft. 5\u00bd in.) indicates that both time and labour were available. We can therefore roughly date the images\nfrom the campanile, &c. The images may be as old, but can be no older.\n\nNow on the stones of the campanile letters are to be found lightly traced by the point of a chisel. There is only one on any given stone, and in all I discovered nine of them cut, evidently to help the builder in placing the stones correctly.\n\nSINGLE LETTERS ON STONES OF THE \"POT-GULA.\"\n\nFrom their form the letters can be at once, and with certainty, ascribed to the latter half of the eleventh or to the twelfth century A.D. So that Mr. Bell's estimate* is entirely supported by first-rate evidence. And it may be assumed that these huge images, which in their style and colossal proportions so nearly resemble those at the \"Gal-vih\u00e1re\" in Polonnaruwa, were commenced by Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu I., or at least in his reign. And perhaps in the raid of K\u00e1l\u00ednga M\u00e1gha, which followed soon after, they were abandoned, and Tantri-malai left to grow up in forest and to become a home of buffaloes and bears.\n\nIt is satisfactory to have arch\u00e6ological evidence regarding the date of these great stone figures; but even without it I think it would have been obvious that they could not belong to the simple times of early Buddhism. The idea of huge images was not entertained until several centuries after Christ. They in their way are fine, but it is not the way of the simple monks who lived in the early cave monasteries.\n\nBefore leaving this side of the arch\u00e6ology of Tantri-malai, it may be added that I found nothing to support Mr. Parker's\n\n* \"They manifestly belong to much the same period of lithic sculptured art as the five examples at Polonnaruwa.\"\u2014Annual Report, A.S., 1891, p. 8.\ntheory that \"Up\u00e1tissa Nuwara\" may have been near or at Tantri-malai.* Up\u00e1tissa, the capital before the rise of Anur\u00e1dhapura, must have been a large town, and I think that had it been here, we should certainly find some systematic water supply in use from the earliest times, instead of finding, as we do, that the first monastery was dependent upon the water-holes.\n\nSo far I have dwelt only upon the history of Tantri-malai as revealed by its archaeology; but there is another question which may be found interesting.\n\nIn three caves at Tantri-malai, in a cave at Bill\u00e9wa, and in a cave at \u00c1ndiy\u00e1-gala, two places a couple of miles apart and some three miles respectively south and south-west of Tantri-malai, I found rude drawings or paintings on the walls and roof. In each case the cave in which the pictures are is one which has a drip-ledge cut and has certainly been used as part of a monastery; but the drawings are of a most primitive style, and certainly do not belong to the period of monastic occupation. The cave at Bill\u00e9wa has an inscription cut in characters which may belong to the third or fourth century A.D.; the \u00c1ndiy\u00e1-gala cave has an inscription of the same or a little earlier date; while, as we have seen, Tantri-malai was occupied up to the end of the twelfth century A.D. The drawings are therefore comparatively modern.\n\nThe neighbourhood is almost entirely uninhabited, but the nearest villages on both the north and the south are occupied by Wanniy\u00e1s. These people are called \"Verdar\" by their Tamil neighbours on the north and \"Vedd\u00f3\" by the Sinhalese to south of them, the word in either case meaning the same. They admit that they are Vedd\u00e1s of the Dunna gat warig\u00e9, the \"clan of the bow,\" but they call themselves Vil Wanniy\u00e1r. For they are bi-lingual, and speak both Tamil and Sinhalese impartially. They claim community of race with the Tamanka\u1e0duwa Vedd\u00e1s, but say that their clan is a separate one.\u2020 Curiously enough they claim descent from the S\u00fariya-wa\u1e47sa, the original royal stock of the Sinhalese.\n\n* \"Ancient Ceylon,\" page 245.\n\u2020 The Vedd\u00f3 of Tamanka\u1e0duwa are of the Tala-warig\u00e9 clan.\u2014B., Ed. Sec.\nThey are nice, simple, honest people of the forest, rather shy at first, but willing when acquainted to tell one all their lore. It appears probable that the pictures in the caves are the work of their ancestors. However, the present people deny all knowledge of this, and say that no one draws like that now.\n\nI have copied to scale and in their correct colours all the pictures I found; but beyond this and a few remarks as to their appearance, I do not feel competent to discuss them.*\n\nIn the majority of cases the subject appears to be the human form; some hold bows in their hands, and one holds in his two hands what may be regarded either as a bow and an arrow or a sword and shield; others appear to be animals and birds, and a fine spotted leopard is among the best, though his head is unfortunately missing; other subjects are mere diagrams, and among these too are obviously bows and arrows, and one apparently the sun. All belong to the same school of art, though I should not expect to find them the work of a single person, owing to the various methods used to express the head. Several are almost spirited sketches, and obviously portray motion. A feature which distinguishes them from most scribblings of the same sort is their chastity and sexlessness. The colour principally used is ash gray, but in two instances black is found, and in three a dull red. All alike seem to have been painted with the artist's finger as a brush, and all are on the bare rock, not on plaster.\n\nMy hope in copying them was less that they would prove of great interest in themselves, than that they might aid in linking up this northern tribe of Vedd\u00e1s or Wanniy\u00e1s with the others of their race.\u2020\n\nI conclude with a few measurements taken with the idea of testing Mr. Parker's brick theory, and some comments thereon.\n\n* Appendix A.\n\n\u2020 The Archaeological Commissioner discovered and photographed Vedd\u00e1 \"ash pictures\" at Arangoda-gala and Konattegoda-gala near the M\u00e1dura-oya, during his circuit of 1897 through Tamankaduwa (Annual Report, A. S., 1897, p. 15). Similar drawings have since been found in Bintenna by Prof. C. J. Seligmann (Journ., C. A. S., Vol. XXI., No. 61, 1908, p. 77).\u2014B., Ed. Sec.\nMr. Parker says of Tantri-malai:\u2014\"The bricks of the dagaba are 3\u00b723 in. thick and 9\u00b704 in. wide, Bt. (breadth \u00d7 thickness) being 29\u00b72, and the length either 18 in., making the contents 525 cubic inches, or, if it was six times the thickness, 19\u00b738 in., which would make the contents 565 cubic inches. In either case the size points to a time late in the second century, or early in the first century B.C.\"*\n\nAt the dagaba I measured the ten most perfect bricks I could secure, with the result tabulated below. Where I have put \" & + \" it means that the brick was broken, i.e., 10 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 8 & + means that the last measurement has an uncertain quantity greater than eight:\n\n| Brick Dimensions | Bt. |\n|------------------|-----|\n| 2\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) in. \u00d7 7\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) in. \u00d7 9\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in. | 3\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) in. \u00d7 8\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in. \u00d7 10 in. & + |\n| 3\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) in. \u00d7 8\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in. \u00d7 10\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in. & + | 2\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) in. \u00d7 10\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) in. \u00d7 12\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in. |\n| 1\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) in. \u00d7 9\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) in. \u00d7 7 in. & + | 2\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) in. \u00d7 8\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in. \u00d7 10 in. |\n| 3 in. \u00d7 7\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in. \u00d7 9\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) in. | 2\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) in. \u00d7 9 in. \u00d7 9\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in. & + |\n| 3\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) in. \u00d7 7\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) in. \u00d7 11 in. | 3 in. \u00d7 8\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in. \u00d7 10\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in. |\n\n\u2234 Bt. = 24\u00b722, and average thickness 2\u00b785.\n\nFurther on, Mr. Parker writes: \"Colossal, sitting, and reposing statues of Buddha cut out of the solid rock, at which the bricks are of pre-Christian date or the first century A.D.,\" &c.\n\nAt the sedent Buddha a well-preserved wall enables one to measure a large number of bricks easily. Eight widths were 9 in., 9 in., 9 in., 9\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in., 10\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in., 11 in., 11\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in., averaging 9\u00b781 in.; eight lengths were 5\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in., 5\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in., 6 in., 6 in., 6 in., 6\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in., 6\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in., 6\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in., averaging 6\u00b706 in.\n\nThe average thickness of 30 bricks was 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in. Bt. thus is 15\u00b715, and average cubic contents 148\u00b762. On referring to Mr. Parker's Table of Measured Bricks\u2020 I find that their size would render these bricks liable to be included in those of 800\u20131350 A.D.\n\nThere is no brickwork near the recumbent Buddha which yields such sure results, and I only succeeded in finding two fragments worth measuring: these were respectively 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in.\n\n* \"Ancient Ceylon,\" pp. 244, 245. \u2020 Loc. cit., p. 673.\nby $8\\frac{1}{2}$ in. by (?) and $2\\frac{1}{4}$ in. by 9 in. by (?). It is possible that they were brought in recent times from the dagaba to serve as stands for joss sticks, and in any case their evidence is not enough to go upon.\n\nI have given these measurements at somewhat tedious length, because they are part of my foundations for a disbelief. They are not the whole of the foundations, for I have measured bricks before, and generally only to find that their variation rendered them insecure evidence upon which to found theories.\n\nWith all respect to an accomplished archaeologist, I venture to predict that Mr. Parker's \"Table of Measured Bricks\"\u2014what is ordinarily called Mr. Parker's \"brick theory\"\u2014will never supply a really reliable criterion of the antiquity of ruins. The measurements given above show how two independent people could obtain quite different results from the same material, and I believe that in many other places we should find as great a divergence. Beyond the fact that old bricks are large and newer bricks smaller, I do not believe the ancient Sinhalese had so standardized their brick-making that any measurements based upon the assumption of such a standard are reliable in giving a date even approximately; though as secondary and corroborative evidence such measurements may be valuable.\n\nOne other observation in the neighbourhood of Tantri-malai bears upon the same brick theory, though in itself it is epigraphical in nature.\n\nOn page 211 of \"Ancient Ceylon\" Mr. Parker, in giving a list of the data from which his brick theory was, built up, says: \"The list of structures of various periods will probably be accepted as belonging to the dates here assigned.\" But to one of these I am unable to agree. No. 8 is given as an inscription in a cave at Mill\u00e9wa-gala Vihare near Tantri-malai, \"in letters of the first or second century A.D.\" which Mr. Parker ascribes to Ila-N\u00e1ga or one of the earlier N\u00e1gas of the second century. The same inscription was copied by Mr. Bell in 1896, and by me in 1909; all three readings are the same, and there is no question of identity. The name in the inscription is Na ka ra ja. The writing is identical with that used in Mah\u00e1 S\u00e9na's inscriptions of the end of the third\nand beginning of the fourth century A.D., and in these he is variously called Senanaka and Naka. So, if my view of this can be accepted, we get third-fourth for first-second century. In other caves at Bill\u00e9wa* there are inscriptions of various dates. They can only be judged by the form of the script; but two appear to belong to a period at least as early as the first century B.C. So we have in one place lithic records covering a period of about 400 years. If I am correct in this it must greatly detract from the value of the bricks as data. We have no means of judging to which part of this 400 years they belong, save by their own intrinsic characteristics; but as they are given as data this would be mere moving in a circle.\n\nIt is with reluctance that I disbelieve a theory so well calculated to solve many of Ceylon's archaeological puzzles; but I am convinced that brick measurements as criteria of dates must be accepted with the greatest caution.\u2020\n\nAPPENDIX A.\n\nPAINTINGS FOUND IN CAVES.\n\nPlate I.\u2014A: Group consisting of the sun and three figures, two human and the third doubtful, from the roof of a small cave at Tantri-malai.

After many years' examination of brick ruins of all ages, mostly in the North-Central Province, Mr. Bell has had reluctantly to abandon \"the brick theory,\" except to the very limited degree of the broad generalization, arrived at by Mr. Still independently, that \"old bricks are large and newer bricks smaller.\" All bricks of 18 in. in length and upwards indubitably belong, with extremely rare exceptions, to an early period.\u2014B., Ed.

Evidently the difference between the hard \u1e0d (\u1e0d) and the soft d (\u1e0d) did not occur to Mr. Still, or he would not have derived pi\u1e0da (\u1e0da) from pudanav\u0101 (\u092a\u0941\u0926\u0928\u0935\u093e).*\n\nPi\u1e0da is from \"pinda,\" a lump, and pudanav\u0101 from pu\u1e0d, to worship.\n\nMy rendering of the inscription is: \"belongs to the monk Tissa of (the family of) Baratapi\u1e0da.\"\n\n* Yet chada in Inscription (3) is held to be chada. Confusion of dentals and cerebrals is not unknown in ancient inscriptions.\u2014B., Ed.

Such a person is called \"tapas.\"\n\nI would read the inscription as: \"a gift of the Up\u00e1sik\u00e1 N\u00e1ga, the mother of Bati (Bhati), the master of elephants.\"\n\nInscription (3).\n\n\"Ba ta su ma na ha ta la cha da.\"\n\nOf this, Mr. Still says:\u2014\"Bata Sumana may be taken equally to mean 'Brother Sumana,' or to be a single name; but what his talachada may have been I am not able to explain; tala could possibly be read tal\u00e9, which means the blade of any sharp instrument, and the record may be simply that Bata Sumana cut his name.\"\n\nThis explanation seems rather far fetched. The inscription, in my opinion, simply means: \"the shelter of Batasumana.\" Tala means \"place\" and chada (from chad) \"shelter,\" \"cover,\" \"shade,\" &c.\n\nMarch 8, 1910.\n\nSimon de Silva.\n\n[In order to render Mr. Still's Paper as full and interesting as possible, Mr. H. C. P. Bell, Archaeological Commissioner, has furnished copies of entries recorded by successive Government officials in their Diaries after visiting Tantri-malai.*\n\nSupplementary notes made by Mr. Bell,\u2020 with illustrations from photographs taken by himself in 1896, and drawings of the \"Pot-gula\" and Cave Shrine, are also added.]\n\nAPPENDIX C.\n\nACCOUNTS OF TANTRI-MALAI.\n\nI.\n\nThe rocks, or rather series of bare granite hills, at Tantri-malai are well worth inspection. The naked granite lies in a black mass of undulating hills of solid rock, with plots of shallow grass in the depressions of the undulations, the whole rock mass covering about a square mile.\n\n* Appendix C. \u2020 Appendix D.\nOn the highest point of the rock are the remains of a dagaba with a bo-tree planted in earth brought up from the jungle below; and on opposite sides of the rock on which the dagaba stands are two enormous rock statues of Buddha.\n\nOne is in the sitting posture, nearly 6 ft. high, with two women, one on each side, fanning the deity with \"yak tail\" fans; on each side of the statue is a woman with one of these fans, below that a lion on each side, and below that again a dragon on each side. The statue is cut more than 2 ft. into the living rock, and the face of the carving bears traces of the cement on which the colours of paint were laid on the statues, as at Anuradhapura.\n\nOpposite this statue are a flight of steps cut in the rock, and between the statue and steps the remains of temple.\n\nOn the other side of this stone hill is the other statue, in the usual \"nirvana\" attitude, but of enormous proportion. It is 45 ft. long by nearly 15 ft. deep across the arms and chest, and the whole is cut 5 or 6 ft. deep into the solid rock. The nose has been broken off and lies beside the statue. It is about 18 in. long, and it was with difficulty I could lift it in both hands. The tradition amongst the people is that the wild bees incessantly make their combs in the nostrils, and that the Vedd\u00e1s in the neighbourhood as incessantly eat the honey.\n\nBoth statues are still very perfect.\n\nOn a smaller stone hill near the one described above stands a small square stone temple made of rectangular stone, with only 5 or 6 cubic feet space inside and with a small door facing the east.\n\nThe appearance of the upheaved mass of undulating rock covering nearly a square mile is very striking.\u2014Diary, July 15, 1883.\n\nS. Haughton,\nAssistant Government Agent,\nMann\u00e1r.\n\nII.\n\nAt Tantri-malai there are a series of huge granite rocks. On one of the highest there is a trig station. Mihintale and other Anuradhapura hills are plainly visible\u2014also another trig station on Mullamalai, and one overlooks low-country all round as far as the eye can reach, except on the south-west, which is higher ground.\n\nThere is here a well-cut and preserved reclining figure of Buddha, which I made out to be 38 ft. long, cut in the face of the granite rock, which seems to have been split for the purpose of giving a flat perpendicular surface.\n\nOn the top of a rock further off is a bo-tree, I think\u2014a ficus at any rate\u2014and below it another figure of Buddha in a sitting posture cut in the face of the rock. Stone pillars, some standing,\nothers fallen, once supported a roof over the path leading to the figure. The sitting figure is cut in a recess hewn out of the rock. On either side of the sage are figures of gods or demi-gods fanning him. There are cut figures on either side of the recess, and stone steps leading up to the b\u014d-tree.\n\nOn another, almost inaccessible, rock at a little distance, is a square building of cut stone, and in the base of the rock is an artificial cave in which a priest has lately been spending a \"retreat\" of three months. The cave is now uninhabited except by bats, and I wonder how the priest could have stood the stench.\u2014Diary, April 20, 1886.\n\nW. J. S. Boake,\nAssistant Government Agent,\nMann\u00e1r.\n\n---\n\nIII.\n\nTo Tantri-malai and back to Olukkulama, 16 miles. I went to this place in order to make a few measurements, as requested by a marginal note on my Diary of April 20, and also to make a few sketches; but was rather put out of conceit with the expedition on hearing from Mr. Ievers that a Capt. Hogg had already been there and taken photographs, which he had sent to the Governor, who had passed them on to the Asiatic Society.* However, I am glad I went, and it may be that I have noted some little thing which has escaped previous observers.\n\nI have been trying to fix the position of the place on Ferguson's map, which is the only one I have with me; but I cannot find any place on the map nearer to it than Olukkulama, which is somewhere about the 38th mile on the Mann\u00e1r road.\n\nIt lies in a south-westerly direction from Olukkulama, and one passes by Kappachi of the Vav\u00famiy\u00e1 district across the Aruvi-\u00e1r through the Vedd\u00e1 village of Nochhikulama of the North-Central Province, and by the base of the Mullamallai rocks.\n\nAt Tantri-malai went first to the cave below the rock. The cave was cleaned out and there were some mats and chatties, but the priest was said to have gone to Anur\u00e1dhapura. The cave I did not measure the dimensions of; but the entrance is blocked up by a mud wall leaving just room for a man to squeeze in. Within, it is about 10 ft. by 6 ft., and there is standing room. It is cut about half way up the rock, and the distance from the base of the cave to the top of the building on the rock is 34 ft. measured over the surface of the rock.\n\nOpposite to the entrance to the cave, which was formerly of cut stone and having a porch, there is another rock of much greater dimensions, and on the slope of it is constructed a raised\n\n* Capt. Hogg, R. E., photographed the sedent and prone Buddhas Nos. 23, 24, 25), in the seventies.\u2014B., Ed. Sec.\nplatform paved with slabs of rock, some of which measured 10 ft. 10 in. by 3 ft. 3 in. thick\u2014some of them *in situ*. The platform is about 20 ft. square.\n\nI then went to the sitting Buddha, which is excavated out of the solid rock near the top of the highest rock in the place. The sitting portion of the figure is obscured by bricks and stones. I took a sketch from the steps leading to the d\u00e1gaba on the top of the rock.\n\nWhat the height of this rock is I do not know, but I should judge it to be from 150 to 200 ft. to the top from the level out of which it rises.\n\nThe d\u00e1gaba is a small one, and the b\u00f3-tree seems to be growing in it.\n\nThe full length figure is exactly 40 ft. long, and I regret to say that the right arm is broken off. The nose, of which the nostrils are fully carved, came off some years ago.\u2014*Diary, August 23, 1886.*\n\nW. J. S. Boake,\nAssistant Government Agent,\nMann\u00e1r.\n\n---\n\nIV.\n\nI went to Kappachi in the morning, and, after inspecting the village and tank, on to Tantri-malai in the Anur\u00e1dhapura District.\n\nHere there are some very interesting ruins; two Buddhas carved in high relief out of the solid rock, and a curious little stone house on the top of a rock very similar, though on a smaller scale, to one at Dondra in the Southern Province.*\u2014*Diary, September 23, 1886.*\n\nG. M. Fowler,\nAssistant Government Agent,\nVav\u00faniya.\n\n---\n\nV.\n\nWent to inspect the ruins at Tantri-malai. They consist of a group of rocks covering a space of about 60 acres as far as I can see. Fine grassy glades separate some of the larger rocks. The place must have been the abode of Buddhist priests, for ruins of *pansalas* are to be found.\n\nThere is a most picturesque little square block-house on the top of a conical rock about 30 ft. high. The little house is built of cut stones laid one on top of the other, one stone running the whole\n\n* The Dondra ruin, built on high ground, differs. It was once the penetrale, or inner shrine, of a Hindu D\u00e9v\u00e1l\u00e9.\u2014B., *Ed. Sec.*\nlength of the building. The roof is flat, and is similarly made of cut stones. Cornices of carved stone project on the outside edge. There is a tradition that ancient manuscripts were kept in this \"book house\" (S. Poi-g\u00e9), and a copy of a portion of the Mah\u00e1-wans\u00e1 is said to have been found in it about a hundred years ago.\n\nAt the base of the rock and immediately below the \"book house\" is an oblong chamber, 11\u00bd ft. long, cut into the solid rock to a depth of 7\u00bd ft. It is not a chamber built up on the slope of a rock, as is usually found, but is cut square into solid rock. The front must have been closed in by cut stones, part of which still remain in position.\n\nThe remains of an old palace [sic] similar to those at Anur\u00e1dhapura are to be found on the rock on the opposite side to this chamber.\n\nOn the slope of another rock is the recumbent figure of Buddha carved out of the solid rock, standing out slightly; and scattered about are pillars, &c. There is also an old b\u00f3-tree surrounded by a very old dry stone wall.\n\nI had to give up further exploration on account of heavy rain.\n\nFour holes in rock above chamber to let beams in, pillars, &c., showing that there was a room in front of the chamber. The size of the book house is, height 5 ft., 5 ft. broad, and 5 ft. long, by rough measurement.\n\nA Buddhist priest from the Seven K\u00f3ral\u00e9s, Kurum\u00e9gala District, came and asked for permission to occupy and improve Tantri-malai, as pilgrims were in the habit of going there, and that he wished to restore the place with the aid of alms and contribution.\n\nHe said he had a book in his village containing a full description of Tantri-malai. He described it as an old history of the place. It stated that the stone chamber on top of the rock was a \"book house,\" and that it was rifled of its contents during the time of the Dutch.\n\nAsked the priest to produce the history, and said that I would recommend to Government the granting of the rocks to him, provided he gave some guarantee that he would restore the place.\u2014Diary, December 18. 1889.\n\nC. A. Murray,\nGovernment Agent,\nNorth-Central Province.\n\nVI.\n\nThe Tantri-malai ruins have been described by Mr. Haughton in his Diary of July, 1883, but his description of the sitting Buddha and surrounding figures is not quite right.\n\nThe \"guardians\" on each side of the central figure are on a level with its shoulders, and underneath each of them is a makara (mythical animal composed out of a crocodile, an elephant,\nand a peacock); underneath each makara is a lion rampant with face turned away from the figure. Mr. Haughton puts the \"dragons\" under the lions.\n\nThe figure is cut in a recess in the face of the rock, and as the face slopes away towards the top the recess is much deeper at the bottom than at the top. It is about 5 ft. deep at the bottom and about a foot or so at the top. It is about 9 ft. long by 8 ft. in height. The figures being protected in this way from the weather are in an excellent state of preservation\u2014as good as new, in fact. The head of Buddha is surrounded at the back by a cobra's hood.*\n\nThere are pillars in front of the recess, and holes in the rock where the beams of the roof evidently rested, showing that originally there was a temple built up against the rock, with the face of the rock containing the recess to form its back wall.\n\nOn the right of the recess, i.e., on the right hand side of the figure, are two similar figures of Buddha [sic] about half the size, also cut in the rock, but not recessed. One of these is so obliterated by exposure to weather as to be hardly distinguishable as a Buddha.\u2020 Mr. Haughton does not mention these figures. Over the recess are three lines cut in the rock, to carry away the rain water I suppose.\n\nIn the side of the large rock surmounted by the small house (described by Mr. Fowler in his Diary of September 23, 1886) there is a rectangular chamber cut out of the rock (about 8 ft. long by 6 deep and 6 high, as well as I remember). This I found occupied by a Buddhist priest and his servant, a deaf and dumb man, who have lately established themselves here.\u2014Diary, November 22, 1890.\n\nJ. P. Lewis,\nAssistant Government Agent,\nVav\u00faniya.\n\nVII.\n\nGot to Tantri-malai in the evening and had a look round the ruins.\n\nThere is very little forest of any value on the country between the Arippu road and this. One forest about three miles long on each side of Tambiy\u00e1wa has satin and palu, but to no great extent. The country was excessively dry until we reached Tantri-malai, where it had rained recently and rock holes were full of good water.\n\n* In reality a plain circular nimbus, similar to that behind the head of the sedent Buddha in the Cave Shrine at \"Gal Vih\u00e1re,\" Polonnaruwa.\u2014B., Ed.

Sec.\nMr. Ridout and I visited the ruins, some of which he measured.* They have several times been described. I had never been here before, and I must confess to disappointment.\u2014Diary, September 24, 1891.\n\nR. W. IEVERS,\nGovernment Agent, North-Central Province.\n\nVIII.\n\nThe ruins at Tantri-malai are well worth visiting. The sedent Buddha with a guardian on either side and lions below are a beautiful piece of carving, and should be photographed. The recumbent Buddha has been much damaged about the face and right arm.\n\nThe nice little square stone room on top of the rock, said to be a \"Pot-gula,\" is very curious, and in good preservation. I have never seen a similar one. It looks modern from a distance.\n\nI have ordered the bund of the tank to be restored, and then there will be water at Tantri-malai, which will be a boon to travellers.\u2014Letter, July 24, 1896.\n\nE. M. BYRDE,\nGovernment Agent, North-Central Province.\n\nIX.\n\nAt Tantri-malai.\u2020 North-east monsoon breaks; heavy rain every afternoon. Engaged during the fine mornings in excavating the lower part and sinhasana of the sedent Buddha (ot-pilimaya), clearing the colossal prone image (seta pilimaya), both rock carved. Took measurements, notes, and photographs.\n\nTantri-malai is an enormous reach of flattish rock, stretching far and wide. Near the edge of a gal-wala is a single line inscription\u2014the only record yet discovered here. The stone-carved images recall, and may be contemporary with, the \"Gal Vihare\" at Polonnaruwa.\n\nThe main points of interest are:\u2014\n\n(i.) \"Pot-gula\" (so-called), and Cave beneath.\n(ii.) Sedent image on ornamented asanaya with makara torana behind, all rock carved.\n(iii.) D\u00e1gaba.\n(iv.) Recumbent image of Buddha, hewn from the rock.\n\n* Mr. Ridout's drawing of the \"Pot-gula\" is reproduced on Plate A.\u2014B., Ed. Sec.\n\u2020 Notices of Tantri-malai occur in the Official Diaries of Messrs. S. Haughton (1883); W. J. S. Boake (1886); G. W. Fowler (1886); C. A. Murray (1889); J. P. Lewis (1890); R. W. Ievers (1891).\n(i.) \"Pot-gula.\"\n\nMr. C. A. Murray's description is concise:\n\n\"A most picturesque little square block-house on the top of a conical rock about 30 ft. high. The little house is built of cut stones laid one on top of the other. The roof is flat, and is similarly made of cut stone. Cornices of carved stone project on the outside edge.\" It has one entrance.\n\nThere is a tradition that ancient manuscripts were kept in the house, hence its name \"Pot-gula.\"\n\nBelow the \"Pot-gula\" (6 ft. 2 in. by 5 ft. 4 in. high)* is an oblong chamber cut into the solid rock (measuring 12 ft. 6 in. by 7 ft. 6 in. by 6 ft. in height)* with remains of dressed stones, which closed in the front. This might have been the true \"Library,\" the campanile on the crest of the rock being intended for some other purpose. Owing to its confined inner space (3 ft. 2 in. by 4 ft. 10 in.)* it could admit only one person seated.\n\nOpposite the \"Pot-gula\" on a larger rock is the square basement of some building formed of large dressed slabs.\n\n(ii.) Sedent Buddha.\n\nThe image with its moulded sinh\u00e1sana (throne with dado of lions) is cut in high \"sunk relief\" from the steep side of the rock undulation. The figure is 8 ft. in height; its \u00e1sana 3 ft. 3 in. high by 9 ft. in length, and 5 ft. 6 in. in depth.* At the back is conventionally represented part of a well conceived makara torana, with rampant lion supporters, facing outwards on either side; and, above, a couple of ch\u00e1mara bearers.\n\nThe execution of the whole falls short of the finish and magnitude of the not dissimilar ot-pilimaya at the \"Gal Vih\u00e1r\u00e9,\" Polonnaruwa.\n\n(iii.) D\u00e1gaba.\n\nOn the highest point of the Tantri-malai rocks is a small d\u00e1gaba dwarfed by its surroundings.\n\n(iv.) Recumbent Buddha.\n\nBeyond the d\u00e1gaba (which stands between it and the sedent Buddha) is carved a colossal full length figure. The image measures 38 ft. from head to feet.* It has scaled badly from exposure to the elements. The right arm and nose are broken; and altogether the figure is in a sorry condition as compared with the seta pilima of Polonnaruwa, which is exceptionally perfect.\n\nNo rock record is known fixing the name and age of the Tantri-malai ruins, but they manifestly belong to much the same period of lithic sculptured art as the fine examples at Polonnaruwa.\u2014Diary, September 30 to October 5.\u2020\n\nH.

Roof slabs horizontally trabeated. Within, the walls slide into the flat roof by a chamfer and fillet.\n\nMeasurements:\u2014Plan, dimensions 6 ft. 2 in. square (outside), 3 ft. 2 in. (inside); height, 5 ft. 2 in. to 5 ft. 8 in. (outside) according to level of rock base, 3 ft. 7 in. to 4 ft. (inside); entrance, 2 ft. 4 in. wide.\n\n2.\u2014Cave Shrine.\u2020\n\nCut into the bottom of the rounded rock, upon which the \u201cPot-gula\u201d was erected.\n\nMeasurements:\u2014Inside, 12 ft. 10 in. broad by 8 ft. 6 in. deep at present floor level (silted up), but 6 ft. 10 in. at horizontal roof; height, 6 ft. 2 in. at entrance, 6 ft. 10 in. within.\n\nA gal-\u0101sanaya, or stone seat, at the back of the cave, is barely visible above the accumulation of bats\u2019 deposit which has gradually buried it.\n\nThe entrance (3 ft. 9 in. in width), on the north, is at the middle of the front wall of cut stone (1 ft. 6 in. thick), which stretched 7 ft. to either side of the doorway. This wall is now only 4 ft. in height.\n\nAbove the brow of the cave, below a kat\u0101r\u0113, or drip line, are cut four mortices, which once took the ends of roof beams.\n\nOutside the wall a single complete pillar (with semi-octagonal shaft) and one or two stumps show that a vestibule formerly preceded the cave.\n\n3.\u2014Sedent Buddha.\u2021\n\nThe Archaeological Commissioner, in October, 1896, found the small brick-walled shrine in front of the sculptured image and its accessories choked with d\u00e9bris, which hid everything up to the Buddha\u2019s waist. The shrine itself was freed of brick and earth; but time and weather did not then permit of thorough excavation of the walls outside and along the base of the rock to left and right, or of other desirable digging at Tantri-malai.\n\n* See Plates A and C. \u2020 See Plates B and C. \u2021 See Plates D and E.\nThe ot-pilimaya, or seated image, its \u00e1sanaya, and \"supporters\" are all carved from the rock matrix in a sharp-sided recess (11 ft. 5 in. high by 9 ft. 3 in. broad, with a depth of 6 ft. at the bottom, and only 2 ft. 10 in. at top) cut into a northern shelving face of the rock plateau at one of its steeper, but not very deep, undulations.\n\nAs the top edge of the \u00e1sanaya touches the rock's sloping surface, only its front is shown, no space having been left on either hand to carry the carving round so as to exhibit its sides. In breadth 9 ft. 3 in., it rises 3 ft. 3 in. above the rock floor.\n\nThe lines of the moulding are the familiar ogee plinth, block between fillets, and cyma coping. The central dado (1 ft. deep) is divided into five panels by four pilasters having spreading base and capital. Conventional lions of the homely \"china-dog with frilled-mane\" type, seated cat-like fronting (sejant guardant), occupy the three middle panels, and a profile lion, turned outward (passant guardant), each of those at the end.\n\nThe Buddha, sculptured in three quarter round, is seated well back (2 ft.) on his throne. The figure is represented in the posture almost universally adopted in Ceylon\u2014the dhy\u00e1na m\u00fbdra, or attitude of meditation\u2014crossed-legged (the right foot and ankle above the left, soles upwards), and hands with open palms laid on the lap similarly. The robe (sa\u1e45gala sivura) droops from the left shoulder, hiding the left arm, but exposing the right breast and arm.\n\nAn oval face, thick fleshy lips, pendent ears (no longer weighted with the rings of royalty), and sleepy half-closed eyes give to the countenance a sleek expressionless look.\n\nA sirespota, or \"glory,\" crowns the ushnishika (skull protuberance) above the stiff hair curls of the head, which is backed by a plain raised circular bh\u00e1mandala or halo.\n\nThe intention was doubtless to cut behind the figure a torana of uprights and cross bars like that at the Cave Shrine of \"Gal Vih\u00e1r\u00e9,\" Polonnaruwa; but, beyond the completion of the pair of makara heads (with trunks coiled) which would have terminated the ends of the uppermost transons, none of the carving of the arch was executed.\n\nAt the \"Gal Vih\u00e1r\u00e9\" the sedent Buddha is not only flanked (as at Tantri-malai) by a pair of rampant lions, but \"supported\" on either side by an attendant bearing a ch\u00e1mara, or fly whisk, with two gods (Br\u00e1hma and Vishnu) of the Hind\u00fa Trimurti above the torana and s\u00e9sata overhead. Here exigences of space forced the sculptors to compress the four anthropomorphic figures into two, supplanting the d\u00e9viy\u00f3 by the chouri holders (coiffured in turbans instead of muk\u016bta head gear) and to forego the chatra altogether.\n\nMeasurements:\u2014Buddha, height (exclusive of the sirespota, 8 in.) from ushnishika to thighs, 7 ft. 6 in.; from knees to rock at back, 3 ft. 9 in.; across shoulders, 4 ft. 4 in.; waist, 2 ft. 1 in.; elbow to elbow, 4 ft. 9 in.; across knees, 7 ft. 7 in.; head, 8 ft. 8 in. by 1 ft. 6 in.; ears, 1 ft. 4 in. long; hand, 2 ft. 1 in.; foot, 2 ft. 2 in.\n\nThe rampant sinhay\u00f3 (3 ft. 9 in. high) of the Indian y\u00e1li, or horned variety, are represented in profile, addorsed, facing to\nright and left, and half bearing on their own the makara heads. They stand 9 in. above the \u0101sanaya.\n\nEach ch\u0101mara k\u0101raya (2 ft. 11 in. in height) is heavily, but differently, adorned with a variety of ornaments; both wear the upav\u012bta, or Br\u0101hmanical cord.\n\nSome 6 ft. on either side of the recess containing the Buddha are incised\u2014more or less shallowly\u2014four oblong panels from 3 to 4 ft. in size. The three outer panels on the right are merely outlined; as are the two towards the left end. But in the first and second panels respectively the carving of a figure in relief has been begun, though it is barely \"boasted out.\" The first panel on the left alone holds a figure, roughly finished, seated cross-legged, with hands in lap like the Buddha, but differentiated by its mukuta, or tall-peaked head dress.\n\nPerhaps the intention was to delineate eight Bodhisatray\u014d.\n\nFrom the one, central, entrance to the shrine of the Buddha (no longer roofed) there is gradual ascent by a couple of steps succeeded by two flights of nine, separated by short landings\u2014all of easy going, with low risers and very broad tread. These stairs, 8 ft. 6 in. in breadth, are cut crisply in the galpota, or rock outcrop, and lead up towards the d\u0101gaba situated on its summit. Sockets at the half-way landing betoken a former pillared and roofed portico.\n\n4.\u2014Recumbent Buddha.*\n\nThe gigantic s\u0113ta pilimaya is sculptured at a brow of the plateau below the d\u0101gaba, also facing north. It represents the Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na of Gautama Buddha, and was manifestly intended to be a close replica of the colossal recumbent image of the \"Gal Vih\u0101r\u0113,\" Polonnaruwa.\n\nThe carving of the head, forearm, and bolster which underlies them, was never quite finished. Further, the head and left bent forearm have been deliberately damaged, and the features of the face are now indistinguishable.\n\nThe whole length of the recess in which the figure lies is 40 ft. 8 in.; but the image itself, finished with a sirespota,\u2020 would not measure more than 38 ft. 4 in., or simply from the ushnishika to the soles of the feet only 36 ft.\n\nThe figure is shown in the orthodox pose. It lies on its right side, with head supported upon the right hand, both resting on a bolster. The left arm and hand, with extended fingers, lie flat along the side, whilst the feet are stiffly placed one upon the other. All but the right breast and hand is covered by the upper robe; the under robe (andana sivura) is just seen exposed at the ankles.\n\nMeasurements:\u2014Head, 5 ft. 2 in. across; ear, 3 ft. 10 in. by 10 in.; height, left shoulder to right forearm, 10 ft. 10 in.; height at thigh, 7 ft. 3 in.; left arm, 13 ft. 3 in.; hand, 5 ft. 3 in. by 1 ft. 6 in.; foot, 2 ft. 8 in. broad.\n\n* See Plate F.\n\n\u2020 Capt. Hogg's photograph (No. 25) shows the sirespota or flame process. It is now virtually obliterated.\nThat monarch's inscription and the testimony of the Mah\u00e1wa\u1e47a prove that the images of the \"Gal Vih\u00e1r\u00e9\" at Pojomaruwa were undoubtedly executed by Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu the Great (A.D. 1164\u20131197).\n\nThe rock-sculptured figures at Tantri-malai were also almost certainly carved, if not by the same ruler, at least by Ni\u1e63\u1e63anka Malla (A.D. 1198\u20131207), his only worthy successor prior to the subjugation of the Island by the Southern Indian invaders under M\u00e1gha, which followed within a few years.\n\nThat sudden inroad, and the chaos that ensued, probably prevented the completion of the images, &c., and brought about the final abandonment of Tantri-malai as a Buddhist monastery.\n\nH. C. P. BELL,\nArch\u00e6ological Commissioner.\n\n8. The Ven. the Archdeacon, Messrs. B. Horsburgh, P. E. Morgappah, and Rev. Suriyagoda Sumangala took part in the discussion which followed the reading of the Paper.\n\n9. Mr. B. Horsburgh said:\u2014Having had the advantage of a visit to Tantri-malai in the company of Mr. Still, I can testify to the fidelity and carefulness of his description of that most interesting place; and, so far as my knowledge goes, I would also subscribe to the general correctness of the conclusions he has drawn from the silent eloquence of the rocks.\n\nThe evidence of some sudden and overwhelming disaster falling upon the little community while it was engaged in beautifying the settlement by the rock carvings of the two Buddhas and the flight of steps to the d\u00e1gaba is most direct and impressive.\n\nI make no pretensions whatever to arch\u00e6ological knowledge, but it seems to me that in the name itself there is some confirmation of Mr. Still's theory, that the disaster was due to a raid of Tamil invaders. The name appears to be partly Sinhalese and partly Tamil. The \"malai\" can, I think, only be the Tamil word meaning \"hill,\" while the \"Tantri\" is distinctly Sinhalese in form, and is found in the existing g\u00e9 name of Tantrig\u00e9 or Tantrigamag\u00e9. I know of no Tamil word at all like it.\n\nAbout 2\u00bd miles E.N.E. of Tantri-malai is a small group of rocky hills, much higher than Tantri-malai, which bears the name of Mulli-malai, an entirely Tamil name. We had not time to explore this Mulli-malai further than by climbing to one of its highest points, but we saw no signs of general religious occupation, such as are so much in evidence at Tantri-malai.\n\nTantri-malai was, therefore, the chief settlement, and the invaders would probably know its Sinhalese name, whereas they had to invent one for Mulli-malai.\n\nWe approached Tantri-malai from the east, crossing the Mal-watu-oya to Mulli-malai, and then taking a compass line through the forest to Tantri-malai, a route probably followed by no other white man, and it was interesting, in view of what Mr. Still\nPlate A\n\nTANTRI-MALAI\n\"PO-T-GULA\"\n\nHALF ELEVATION AND SECTION.\n\nPLAN.\n\nScale, 4 Feet to an Inch\nTANTRI-MALAI CAVE\n\nCROSS SECTION.\n\nPLAN.\n\nScale, 8 Feet to an Inch.\n\nPlate B\nsays regarding the position of Tantri-malai between Mann\u00e1r and Anur\u00e1dhapura, to find in traversing a gorge between two spurs of Mulli-malai distinct traces of a paved road, which may well be a portion of the ancient track.\n\nMr. Still\u2019s notes on the \"Wanni minissu,\" who are, of course, Vedd\u00e1s, are very interesting. I have seen the drawings he describes, but can offer no explanation of them. They are such as might have been made by a hunting party held up in the caves for a few days in idleness owing to heavy rain, or\u2014and the fact that their descendants deny all knowledge of them is significant\u2014they may have some religious or ceremonial meaning, because, when visiting the nearest village of these people to Tantri-malai, we observed some cattle in the field branded with the identical bow and arrow that is drawn in the caves. I am, however, quite incompetent to say if totemism has anything to do with it.\n\n10. The Ven. the Archdeacon proposed a vote of thanks to Mr. Still for his interesting Paper.\n\nMr. Horsburgh seconded.\u2014Carried.\n\n11. The Chairman said he was sorry Mr. Still was not there that night, but that he would be very pleased to convey to him the vote of thanks which had been proposed. They were much obliged to Mr. Horsburgh for his suggestive remarks.\n\n12. With a vote of thanks to the Chairman, proposed by Sir J. T. Hutchinson, the Meeting terminated.\n\nGENERAL MEETING.\n\nColombo Museum, September 29, 1910.\n\nPresent:\n\nThe Hon. Mr. H. L. Crawford, C.M.G., in the Chair.\n\nThe Hon. Mr. P.

Arun\u00e1chalam read the following Paper entitled \"Kandyan Provinces\":\u2014\nKANDYAN PROVINCES.\n\nBy the Hon. Mr. P. Arunachalam, M.A.Cantab., C.C.S., M.L.C.\nVice-President, R. A. S. (C. B.).\n\nI.\n\nThe Ordinance No. 12 of 1840 was an enactment made (as stated in the preamble) for the prevention of encroachment on Crown lands by persons without any probable claim or pretence of title. Section 6, which is the most important section of the Ordinance, has been the cause of much litigation between Crown and subject, of heated discussion by lawyers and politicians, and of frequent judicial interpretation. It provides that\u2014\n\n(1) All forest, waste, unoccupied, or uncultivated lands are presumed to be the property of the Crown until the contrary is proved;\n\n(2) All chenas and lands, which can only be cultivated after intervals of several years\u2014\n\n(a) If situated in the districts formerly comprised in the Kandyan Provinces, are deemed to belong to the Crown and not to be the property of any person claiming the same against the Crown, except only on proof by such person\u2014\n\n(i.) Of a sannas or grant for the same, together with satisfactory evidence as to the limits and boundaries thereof; or\n\n(ii.) Of such customary taxes, dues, or services having been rendered within twenty years for the same as have been rendered within such period for similar lands being the property of private proprietors in the same districts; and\n\n(b) If situated elsewhere in the Island, are deemed to be forest or waste land within the meaning of subsection (1).\nA distinction is thus created between lands situated in the districts formerly comprised in the Kandyan Provinces, and lands situated elsewhere. A special mode of proof is prescribed in order to rebut the presumption in favour of the Crown in the former case. But the expression \"the districts formerly comprised in the Kandyan Provinces\" has not been explained in the Ordinance. What is the precise meaning of the expression is not clear, and has not been authoritatively decided. Owing to the lapse of time and the research now necessary among ancient documents, the question is a difficult and complicated one. It raises points of historical and political as well as legal interest as to the constitution of the ancient Kandyan Kingdom, the changes introduced therein from time to time under British rule, and the territorial limits within which the system of law called the Kandyan Law prevails.\n\nII.\n\nIn Robertson's Case, 1886, 8 S. C. C. 36, and in Wij\u00e9sinha v. Wij\u00e9sinha, 1891, 9 S. C. C. 199, the Supreme Court referred to the Proclamation of February 11, 1815, which was issued upon the annexation of the Kandyan Provinces, in illustration of the expression. In Robertson's Case, Burnside, C.J., said:\n\n\"The Kandyan Provinces, denominated in the Proclamation of February 11, 1815, 'The Four Korales,' 'The Saffragam Korale,' and 'The Three Korales,' were by that Proclamation declared to be integral parts of the British possessions in the Island of Ceylon, and from thenceforth were received under the sovereignty and protection of His Majesty the King of Great Britain; since which time they have continued to be and form a part of, and have been absorbed into, this Colony of Ceylon. * * * Moreover, the old divisions which defined the original Kandyan Provinces, at the time of the cession, and separated them from the other Provinces, have long since disappeared, and the Kandyan Provinces, as Provinces apart from others, no longer exist, and it would not, I take it, at the present day, be possible to define any particular area of this Colony as the Kandyan Provinces. True it is, that there may be found throughout the Ordinances, references to the 'Kandyan Provinces' eo nomine, but this is\nundoubtedly a loose mode of expression, rendered conspicuously so by the interpretation clause of the Marriage Ordinance, No. 3 of 1870, which defines 'Kandyan Provinces' to mean the 'Provinces mentioned in Schedule B,' and Schedule B enumerates only one entire Province, the Central, with parts of the Eastern, Western, North-Western, Southern, and Northern Provinces\u2014an area widely different from that mentioned in the Proclamation. The expression 'Kandyan Provinces' has, therefore, no legal significance as defining any particular area, distinct and apart from the topographical division of the Island into the several Provinces, Northern, Southern, Eastern, Western, North-Western, Central, North-Central, and very lately, Uva. These together comprise the whole territory of the Colony, but the subdivisions, whether for administrative, judicial, or revenual purposes, are ever changing at the will of the executive or legislative authority, and if there were any such thing as a provincial domicile, it would necessarily be subject to the ever varying changes of provincial boundaries, which to-day might fix the domicile in one Province, and to-morrow transfer it to another, without any actual change of residence.\"\n\nIn the same case Clarence, J., said:\n\n\"It is impossible to speak precisely as to any territorial limits of this application of Kandyan Law, since we are entirely without any definition precising any area over which it may be supposed to extend\"; and Dias, J., said: \"The best definition which I can give of the Kandyan Provinces is, that it is so much of the Island as is not included in the Maritime Provinces. With regard to the exact limits of the Kandyan Provinces we have no precise information, and probably when the whole Island became a British possession it became unnecessary to ascertain and define the exact limits of the two Provinces, Kandyan and Maritime. The first, and, so far as I know, the only official paper which deals with the subject is the Proclamation of February 11, 1815. The definition there given is too general, and wholly insufficient to fix the identity of the old Kandyan Provinces. In Wij\u00e9sinha v. Wij\u00e9sinha, Clarence, J., repeated: \"It is a matter of much\ndifficulty to ascertain within what territorial limits the so-called Kandyan Law is to be considered prevailing.\" In a recent case (Kapuruhami v. Medapola Appuhami, 1910, C. R. Kurunegala, 17,990, Wood-Renton, J., referred to Wijesinha v. Wijesinha as a binding authority.\n\nThe Supreme Court was mistaken in supposing that the only official document dealing with the subject was the Proclamation of February, 1815, or that it set forth the whole of the Kandyan Provinces. That Proclamation, after describing the armies of His Majesty the King of Great Britain as having occupied and entered into complete possession of \"the Kandyan Provinces, denominated the Four Korles, the Suffragam Korle, and the Three Korles,\" and that the Chiefs and people of those Provinces had fully and freely surrendered themselves to His Majesty the King of Great Britain, declares the same to be integral parts of the British Possessions of the Island of Ceylon, and adds that \"many other provinces of the Kandyan Kingdom have been entered and are partially occupied by the British forces.\" (Legislative Acts of the Ceylon Government, 1853, vol. I., p. 177.)\n\nAccording to Sir John D'Oyly (\"A Sketch of the Constitution of the Kandyan Kingdom,\" 1818*), the Kandyan Kingdom consisted of twenty-one grand divisions, of which the twelve principal were called diss\u00e1vani (counties) and the majority of the rest rata (districts).\n\nThe diss\u00e1vanis were each placed under the order of a Chief or Governor called Diss\u00e1wa. They were the Four K\u00f3ral\u00e9s,\n\n* Prepared by him when administering that Territory (1815-1824), and published (in part) in the \"Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland\" (1833), vol. 3, pp. 191 et seq., at the instance of the Vice-President Sir Alexander Johnstone, who was Chief Justice of Ceylon, 1811-1820; reprinted in the Sessional Papers, 1891, pp. 107 et seq. Complete copies exist only in manuscript. There is one in the Colombo Museum. The whole of this interesting work deserves publication after collation of all existing manuscripts by a competent editor. Sir John D'Oyly was a very distinguished member of the Ceylon Civil Service. After a creditable career at Cambridge, where he was 2nd Chancellor's Medallist in Classics and a Senior Optime, he entered the Ceylon service in 1802, rose to be Resident and First Commissioner of the Government in the Kandyan Provinces, and was created a Baronet in 1821 for his services in conducting the negotiations in connection with the Kandyan Convention. He died at Kandy in 1824.\nthe Seven K\u00f3ral\u00e9s, \u00dava, M\u00e1tal\u00e9, Sabaragamuwa, the Three K\u00f3ral\u00e9s, Walapan\u00e9, Udapal\u00e1ta, Nuwarakal\u00e1wiya, Wellassa, Bint\u00ebnna, and Tamanka\u1e0duwa. The other nine districts were respectively under the authority of Chiefs who, except the last two, were distinguished by the name of Rat\u00e9mahatmay\u00e1s. They were Udunuwara, Ya\u1e6dinuwara, Tumpan\u00e9, H\u00e1rispattuwa, Dumbara, H\u00e9w\u00e1h\u0113ta, Kotmal\u00e9, U\u1e0da Bulatgama, and P\u0101\u1e6da Bulatgama (p. 17).\n\nIII.\n\nThe term Kandyan Provinces, as distinct from Maritime Provinces, was used by the British Government to designate the Provinces of the Kandyan Kingdom. See, e.g., Order in Council of April 12, 1832, published at p. 371 of vol. I. of the Legislative Acts of the Ceylon Government, 1853, where the terms Maritime Provinces and Kandyan Provinces are contrasted.\n\nThe boundary between the Maritime districts acquired by the British at the capitulation of Colombo in 1796, and the Dominions of the Sinhalese Monarchy ceded to the King of Great Britain by the Convention of 1815, had been clearly defined by a Treaty between the Sinhalese Government and the Dutch East India Company in the \u015aaka year 1688, equivalent to 1766 A.D.\n\nThe material portions of that Treaty* are as follows:\n\n\"Second Article.\u2014The illustrious Lord Emperor, and the illustrious the principal members of His Majesty\u2019s Great Council of Ministers ...... recognize the ...... States General of the United Provinces and the Company of Hollanders (in the East) as the rightful and independent overlord (\u0915\u094b\u0921\u093c\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0901 \u0926\u0947\u0936) of the several districts of this Island of Lanka, which had been held by the Company before the war now concluded, to wit, Yapa Pattanama, the districts thereto belonging, Hettikula Pattuwa, Mannarama, with the places\n\n* The Treaty in the original Sinhalese appears in vol. 16 of the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, Ceylon (p. 62 et seq.), with a translation by Mr. H. C. P. Bell, first published in the Orientalist, vol. 3, p. 115. The translation given above differs slightly from Mr. Bell\u2019s.\nappertaining thereto, the country from there, (that is to say) Kalpitiya and the places appertaining thereto; Kolamba Disava, Galu Korale, Matara Disava, Puliyanduva, Trikunamale, with the places appertaining thereto. . . . . . *\n\n\"Third Article.\u2014Moreover, all the sea board round the Island not held by the Company before the war . . . . . is to be given over to the above-named . . . . .

Company recognizes the Supreme Government (of His Majesty) as the Sovereign and independent Lord Paramount of the other districts of this Island of Lanka.\"\n\nIn accordance with the above Treaty the boundary of the seaboard mentioned in the third article appears to have been defined by a surveying compass, and the Compass road then opened on the west coast still exists under the name Kompas-p\u00e1ra from Kammala northwards, marking the line of separation between the districts governed by the Roman-Dutch Law and those where the Kandyan Law prevails.\n\nIV.\n\nThe Proclamation of February 11, 1815, it will be seen, mentions by name only a part of the Kandyan Provinces, equivalent in the main to the modern districts of Ratnapura\n\n* Yapapattanama = Jaffnapatam, or Jaffna.\nHettikulapattuwa = Chettikulam.\nMannarama = Mannar.\nKolamba Disawa = Colombo.\nGalu Korale = Galle.\nPuliyanuduwa = Puliyanivu, or Batticaloa.\nTrikunamale = Trincomalee.\n\n\u2020 This is very probably the Karadi Aru of the Trincomalee District.

Another Proclamation was issued on March 2, 1815, after the capture of the Kandyan King, and as a result of a Convention held with the chiefs of the Kandyan Provinces. This Proclamation declares the dominion of the Kandyan Provinces to be vested in the Sovereign of the British Empire, and that the administration of civil and criminal justice and police over the Kandyan inhabitants of the said Province is to be exercised according to established forms and by the ordinary authorities, but does not specify the names or limits of those Provinces. (Legislative Acts of the Ceylon Government, 1853, vol. I., p. 179.)\n\nThe Constitution and administration remained unaltered, except that a resident on behalf of the King of Britain was placed at the head, viz., Mr. (afterwards Sir) John D'Oyly, assisted by Mr. Simon Sawers as First Assistant to the Resident and Agent of Government at Badulla, and by Mr. Henry Wright as Second Assistant and Agent of Government at Kandy.\n\nUnder the Minute of April 28, 1815, the Kandyan Provinces were divided into five divisions and placed under the administration of a Board consisting of a President, a Judicial Commissioner, and a Revenue Commissioner, with the Commanding Officer of the Troops in the interior. This Board, with the Adig\u00e1rs and principal chiefs, formed the Great Court of Justice, from whose sentence there was no appeal, except to the Governor. The civil authority was exercised as before by the native Diss\u00e1was.\n\nI have not been able to trace this Minute, which I quote from Ievers' Manual, North-Central Province, p. 62. It is not to be found either in the Kandy Kachcheri or in the Colonial Secretary's Office. The Acting Government Agent of Kandy, Mr. Hellings, has kindly supplied me with a copy of a warrant or commission dated September 30, 1816, establishing the Board and prescribing its duties. The warrant is printed in the Appendix. The Board, it will be seen, does not include the Commanding Officer of the Troops, but only the Resident (John D'Oyly), the Accredited Agent in charge of Judicial business (James Gay), and Accredited Agent in charge of\nRevenue business, &c. (Simon Sawers). The Commanding Officer apparently did not join the Board till 1819.*\n\nThe Government Almanacs of 1817 and 1818 (pp. 65-69) enumerate the following Kandyan Provinces:\n\nFour K\u00f3ral\u00e9s, Seven K\u00f3ral\u00e9s, \u00dava, M\u00e1tal\u00e9, Sabaragamuwa, Three K\u00f3ral\u00e9s, Walapan\u00e9, Udapal\u00e1ta, Nuwarakal\u00e1wiya, Wellassa, Tamanka\u1e0duwa, Bintenna, Udunuwara, Ya\u1e6di-nuwara, Tumpan\u00e9, H\u00e1rispattu, Dumbara, H\u00e9w\u00e1h\u0119ta, Kotmal\u00e9 and Upper Bulatgama, Minn\u00e9ri and Lower Bulat-gama.\n\n* The following is a list of the members who, as far as can be ascertained, composed the Board:\n\n1816.\nJohn D'Oyly, Resident and First Commissioner.\nJames Gay, Second Commissioner, and in charge of the Judicial Department.\nSimon Sawers, Third Commissioner, and in charge of the Revenue Department.\n\n1819.\nJohn D'Oyly, Resident.\nLieut.-Col.

From the records that have been preserved in the Colombo Museum, the Registrar-General\u2019s Office, and the Government Record Office, the Kandyan Provinces of which the Census was taken were:\n\n(1) Yatinuwara, consisting of the town and suburbs of Kandy and \u201cvillages within the rivers and districts beyond the rivers.\u201d\n\n* The assignment of jurisdiction in Nuwarakal\u00e1wiya by this Proclamation having been found \u201ctoo indefinite and productive of inconvenience,\u201d the Minute of the Governor of September 18, 1819, assigned Kiralowa, Matombuwa, Undurawa, Kalagamuwa, Hurulu, Mahapotana, and Maminia pattus to the Board of Commissioners and under them the Agents of Government in Matale; and Parawaha, Kahalla, Negampaha, Kalagam, Eppawala, Ulugalla, and Nuwaragam pattus to the Agent of Government in the Seven Korales.\n(2) Udunuwara.\n(3) Udapalata.\n(4) Uda Bulatgama.\n(5) Kotmal\u00e9.\n(6) Harasiyapattu.\n(7) Tumpan\u00e9.\n(8) Dumbara.\n(9) Hewaheta.\n(10) Walapan\u00e9.\n(11) \u00dava (upper and middle divisions).\n(12) \u00dava (lower division).\n(13) Wellassa.\n(14) Bintenna.\n(15) Sabaragamuwa.\n(16) Three K\u00f3ral\u00e9s and Lower Bulatgama.\n(17) Four K\u00f3ral\u00e9s.\n(18) Seven K\u00f3ral\u00e9s (upper and lower divisions).\n(19) Matal\u00e9.\n(20) Nuwarakal\u00e1wiya (western and eastern half).\n(21) Tamanka\u1e0duwa.\n\nAnother Census appears to have been taken in the year 1832, and the following Kandyan Provinces, as distinct from Maritime Provinces, are shown in the record of the Census results in the Government Almanac of 1834. Apparently the Census did not embrace all the Kandyan Provinces, but only\u2014\n\n(1) Udara\u1e6da.\n(2) Four K\u00f3ral\u00e9s.\n(3) Three K\u00f3ral\u00e9s.\n(4) Seven K\u00f3ral\u00e9s.\n(5) Matal\u00e9.\n(6) Sabaragamuwa.\n(7) Tamanka\u1e0duwa.\n\nThe Government Almanac of 1832 (pp. 91\u201392) gives the districts of the Kandyan Provinces as follows for the purposes of jurisdiction under the Proclamation of November 21, 1818:\n\n(1) \u00dava and Bintenna.\n(2) Sabaragamuwa.\n(3) Seven K\u00f3ral\u00e9s and north part of Nuwarakal\u00e1wiya.\n(4) Three K\u00f3ral\u00e9s.\n(5) Tamanka\u1e0duwa.\n(6) Kandy.\n(7) Four K\u00f3ral\u00e9s.\n(8) M\u00e1tal\u00e9 and east part of Nuwarakal\u00e1wiya.\n(9) H\u00e1rasiyapattu and Tumpan\u00e9.\n(10) H\u00e9w\u00e1h\u0119\u1e6da south of Maha-oya and Walapan\u00e9.\n(11) Lower \u00dava and Wellassa.\n\nV.\n\nLieutenant-Colonel Colebrooke, one of His Majesty\u2019s Commissioners of Inquiry on the Administration of the Government of Ceylon, in his report of December 24, 1831, to the Secretary of State, says:\n\n\"The Kandyan Provinces, which had been first acquired by the British Government in 1815, were settled on their present footing after the rebellion in 1818, and have been separately administered by the Governor, without the assistance of his Council. These Provinces were placed under the immediate superintendence of a Board of Commissioners, which Board is now composed of the Commandant of the Troops in Kandy and two Civil Servants, having charge respectively of the Judicial and Revenue Departments. The Kandyan territory is divided into eleven provinces or districts, of which five, situated above the hills around Kandy\u2014(1) Udaratte, (2) Four Korales, (3) Matale and east part of Nuwarakalawa, (4) Harasipattoo and Tumpane, (5) Hewahette and Walapane\u2014are placed under the immediate superintendence of the Board of Commissioners, to whom the Government Agents resident in those districts directly refer. The districts situated more remotely from Kandy, and below the hills, are also placed under Government Agents, who are intrusted with the same authority which is exercised by the Collectors in the Maritime Provinces. In one district (Seven Korales), a separate agent for part of the judicial affairs has been appointed, but the Government Agents in that and all the other districts are charged with the civil and judicial duties and with those of police. With the exception of\nthe Government Agencies in the three Provinces of Saffragam, Seven Korales, and Tamankaduwe, which are held by Civil Servants, these offices have been filled by officers of the regiments stationed in the Island.\n\n\"The separate administration of the Kandyan Provinces is maintained under the Convention which was concluded in the name of His Majesty with the Kandyan chiefs in 1815,* and modified in some of its provisions by a Proclamation of the Governor,\u2020 issued after the rebellion in 1818, by which the authority of the chiefs was curtailed. By the 4th clause of the Convention of 1815, the dominion of the Kandyan Provinces was vested in His Majesty, subject to the condition of maintaining the laws, institutions, and customs of the country; and by the 5th clause the religion of Bhood was declared inviolable, and its rights, members, and places of worship were to be maintained and protected.\" (\"R\u00e1man\u00e1than's Reports,\" 1820\u201333, p. 204.)\n\nLieutenant-Colonel Colebrooke added (ibid, p. 216): \"The maintenance of separate and independent establishments in the Maritime and the Kandyan Provinces has been impolitic, in the check it has opposed to the assimilation which it is on every account desirable to promote between the various classes of whom the population is composed. By maintaining a separate Government at Kandy the influence of the chiefs has been upheld, to the prejudice, in some instances, of the people. The Kandyan districts which are situated below the mountain have a nearer and more natural connection with those of the coast, with which they maintain a trading intercourse.\"\n\nAs the result of this report, a Proclamation was issued on October 1, 1833, by which the distinction between the Kandyan and Maritime Provinces was abolished, and the whole Island was divided into five Provinces\u2014the Northern, the Southern, the Eastern, the Western, and the Central, which were declared to consist of the following districts. I have italicized the names of the Kandyan Provinces and districts under the previous constitution.\n\n* See Convention dated March 2, 1815.\n\u2020 See Proclamation dated November 21, 1818.\n\"The Northern Province shall consist of the country hitherto known as the districts of Jaffna, Mannar, and the Wanny; as the Dessavony of Nuvarakalawiya; and as the Island of Delft.\n\n\"The Southern Province shall consist of the country hitherto known as the districts of Galle, Tangalle, Matura, and Hambantotte; as the Dessavony of Saffragam, and as the Province of Lower Uva and Welasse.\n\n\"The Eastern Province shall consist of the country hitherto known as the districts of Trincomalie and Batticaloa; and as the Provinces of Tamankadewa and Bintenne.\n\n\"The Western Province shall consist of the country hitherto known as the districts of Colombo, Chilaw, and Putlam; as the Dessavonies of Seven Korales, Four Korales, and Three Korales; and as the Province of Lower Bulatgama.\n\n\"The Central Province shall consist of the country hitherto known as the districts of Kandy, Yattinuwara, Udunuwara, and Harasiapattoo, Tumpane, Dumbara, Hewahette, Kotmale, Upper Bulatgamme, and Weyeloowa; and as the Dessavonies of Uva, Matelle, Udapalata, and Wallapana.\"\n\nVI.\n\nThe expression in the Ordinance No. 12 of 1840, section 6, \"Districts formerly comprised in the Kandyan Provinces,\" therefore, emphasises the fact that since the Proclamation of October 1, 1833, there were no longer in law any provinces that could be called the Kandyan Provinces, and means the territory covered by the Dissavanis and Ratas enumerated by Sir John D'Oyly (pp. 106-7 supra), and the divisions set out in the Proclamation of November 21, 1818 (pp. 111-12), the western boundary between the Kandyan and Maritime Provinces being the Kompas-p\u00e1ra referred to at p. 107.\n\nThe conclusion I have arrived at I have since found to be supported by an old map of Ceylon in the possession of the Surveyor-General. It was prepared in 1822 by the then Surveyor-General, Capt. Schneider, and was a few years ago\ndiscovered in turning out some old records in the loft.* In this map the Kandyan Provinces are indicated as consisting of the divisions I have mentioned. A copy of the map is attached to this Paper.\n\nAs to the history of the Kandyan Provinces subsequent to 1833:\n\nIn 1837 Bintenna was transferred from the Eastern to the Central Province, and in 1845 the district of Alupota, which consisted of Lower \u00dava and Wellassa, was added from the Southern Province. The Central Province, so constituted, remained till 1886, when Bintenna east of the Mahaweli-ganga, Wellassa, and \u00dava were formed into a separate Province called the Province of \u00dava.\n\nIn 1839 the district of Alupota was subdivided and distributed among Hambantota, Batticaloa, and \u00dava districts (\"Ceylon Manual,\" 1910, p. 308).\n\nIn 1845, by Proclamation of October 1, 1845, the Seven K\u00f3ral\u00e9s were, with Chilaw and Puttalam districts, taken from the Western Province and formed into a separate Province\n\n---\n\n* No record exists in the Surveyor-General's office relating to Captain Schneider's map. Captain Schneider was a Military Engineer in the service of the Dutch Government, who served under the British Government until his death about 1849 or 1850. From a note on page 259 of the \"Ceylon Manual\" for 1909, he appears to have been employed extensively on the irrigation works of all the maritime parts of the Island; and he also acted as Civil Engineer and Surveyor-General between 1812 and 1816. It is presumed that the map which he drew in 1822 and published in 1826 was compiled from the surveys which he had to undertake while making his reports on irrigation, and from the documents available in the Department at the time, and that he presented the map to the office. The Surveyor-General referred me to the Government Archivist, who, however, had no information regarding Captain Schneider's map.\n\nThe first map of the Island of Ceylon prepared after the British occupation was, the Government Archivist believes, one issued from the office of the Surveyor-General of the Madras Presidency in 1813. This is said to have been prepared in response to a private communication from Sir Robert Brownrigg to General Abercrombie, and a copy was furnished to the Ceylon Government. The Archivist is not aware if this map is extant anywhere. On reference to the Surveyor-General as to this map of 1813, he states: \"This is the first time I have heard of it. I have no copy of it in my possession. There are, I believe, some old maps in the Museum, of which it may be one.\" The Museum authorities, who were consulted, say that the map is not in the Museum.\ncalled the North-Western Province, the headquarters remaining at Puttalam till 1856, when they were transferred to Kurun\u00e9gala.\n\nIn 1873, by the Proclamation of September 6, 1873, Demala hatpattu of the Puttalam district was attached to the newly created North-Central Province, but was re-transferred to the North-Western Province in 1875 by Proclamation of January 1, 1875, and is still treated as a Kandyan district for the purposes of the Kandyan Marriage Ordinance, No. 3 of 1870, schedule B.\n\nIn 1845, by the Proclamation of October 1, 1845, the Dissavani of Saffragam was transferred from the Southern Province to the Western Province, except the Yakawala Hatara B\u00e1ge, which still remains in the Southern Province and is treated as a Kandyan district under the Ordinance No. 3 of 1870, schedule B.\n\nIn 1889 Saffragam (with that exception) and the Four K\u00f3ral\u00e9s and Three K\u00f3ral\u00e9s and Lower Bulatgama (assigned in 1833 to the Western Province) were formed into one Province called the Province of Sabaragamuwa.\n\nIn 1873, by the Proclamation of September 6, Nuwarakal\u00e1wiya (which had been assigned in 1833 to the Northern Province) and Tamankaduwa (which had been assigned to the Eastern Province) were formed with the Demala hatpattu of the North-Western Province into a Province called the North-Central Province. Demala hatpattu was restored to the North-Western Province by Proclamation of January 1, 1875.\n\nIn 1886 (by the Proclamation of February 1 of that year) the present Province of \u00dava was created, as stated above.\n\nThe Provinces created in 1833, therefore, differed from those of the present time as follows: the Western Province of 1833 embraced in addition to its present area the modern North-Western Province and the district of K\u00e9galla; the Central Province embraced besides its present area the greater part of \u00dava Province; the Southern Province in addition to its present area included the Ratnapura district and lower \u00dava and Wellassa of Badulla district; the Northern Province included Nuwarakal\u00e1wiya of the North-Central Province;\nwhile the Eastern Province included Tamanka\u1e0duwa of the North-Central Province and Bintenna of the Badulla district.\n\nFor the purposes of the registration of Kandyan marriages under the Ordinance No. 3 of 1870, the following Provinces are (by section 4) declared to be meant by the term \"Kandyan Provinces\" :\n\nThe Central Province.\nSeven K\u00f3ral\u00e9s\nDemala Pattu of Puttalam\n\nThe U\u1e0da, Palle, and Radda Palatas of Bintenna; the Vannames of Nadene, Naduk\u00e1\u1e0du, and Akkaraipattu; the Sinhalese villages in the division of Panawa\u2014all in the Batticaloa district; Tamanka\u1e0duwa; the Sinhalese villages in the Kaddukulam pattu, in the district of Trincomalee\n\nSabaragamuwa.\n\nFour and Three K\u00f3ral\u00e9s and Lower Bulatgama\n\nYakawala in the Southern Province.\nNuwarakal\u00e1wiya in the Northern Province.*\n\nThe Ordinance No. 9 of 1870 has added to this list \"all Sinhalese villages in the Mannar District.\"\n\nAPPENDIX.\n\n(Note to page 109.)\n\nBy His Excellency Lieutenant-General Sir Robert Brownrigg, Baronet and Knight Grand Cross of the Most Honourable Military Order of the Bath, Governor and Commander-in-Chief in and over the British Settlements and Territories in the Island of Ceylon in the Indian Seas, with the Dependencies thereof.\n\nROBT.

And further, that a Secretary should be appointed to the Residency, to be duly sworn to the faithful discharge of his duties in that capacity, and particularly that he will be secret and not disclose the business of the Residency otherwise than in the due course of his office:\n\nWe therefore direct that from the First day of October next, all heads of reference, minutes, and letters, whether from Us, the said Governor, or the Secretary for the Kandyan Provinces, heretofore transmitted to the Resident, with the inclosures and documents of reference belonging to the same, and also all such as shall hereafter be addressed to the Resident, shall be considered as addressed to the Board of Commissioners and be kept in an office under charge of the Secretary, or in particular cases under the joint keys of the Commissioners, excepting such as the Resident shall in the first instance and from time to time deem fit to be reserved for his own separate disposal, as secret and political, of which he will in the first instance transmit a list and afterwards from time to time notify to the Secretary for the Kandyan Provinces all such papers as shall be so reserved.\n\nThe acts and proceedings of His Majesty's Civil Servants in the public business shall be noted in the minutes of the Board summarily and by heads only, without detail or entry of papers, and all papers having reference to such acts and proceedings are to be compiled in a regular and orderly manner and specified in the minutes by distinct references.\n\nThese entries are to be made by the Secretary of the Residency from memoranda furnished at a sitting or otherwise by the several members of the Board according to their respective duties, namely, by the Resident concerning all that may relate to his general and superintending powers and concerning all that relates to business not appropriated to the immediate charge of the other Commissioners; by the Judicial Agent and Revenue Agent concerning their particular Departments and such other matters as may come under their charge or management or to their knowledge.\n\nThe sittings of the Board will be held from time to time, after the expiration of the present month, at appointed times, not less than thrice a week. The days and hours of such meetings shall be communicated by the Resident or Senior Commissioner present to the Secretary, and by him notified to the other Commissioners or Commissioner, and it will be the duty of the Secretary to procure and communicate such appointment at least 24 hours before the hour of sitting.\nA sitting may be held at the time and place appointed by any two members (the whole having been duly warned), and their proceedings will be noted in the usual manner, but all practical measures proposed or resolved at any such sitting are referred to the provisions hereinafter contained under the head of taking order for the public affairs.\n\nIn matter of information it will be the duty of the Board and of its several members from time to time to procure and deliver in for transmission to the Kandyan office, for the information of Government, all such documents, facts, and particulars of information as may come to their possession and knowledge concerning\u2014\n\n1st.\u2014The rights, privileges, and powers saved to the Chiefs and Headmen by the 4th clause of the Convention;\n\n2nd.\u2014The civil rights and immunities secured to the people by the same clause;\n\n3rd.\u2014The laws, institutions, and customs in the same clause mentioned;\n\n4th.\u2014The customary maintenance and protection promised by the 5th clause to the religion of Boodhoo, its rites, ministers, and places of worship;\n\n5th.\u2014The established forms and ordinary authorities for the administering justice confirmed by the 8th clause;\n\n6th.\u2014The Royal dues, both of Service and Revenue, appropriated to His Majesty\u2019s use by the 11th clause;\n\n7th.\u2014The constitution and interior economy of all officers and departments, with regard to which the statements promised by all the Chiefs to His Excellency at his last visit to Kandy but only furnished in part and by a few of the Chiefs, are to be demanded and transmitted to Colombo;\n\n8th.\u2014The charges and modifications of these institutions by the effect of the new Government and their wilful perversion from corrupt or tyrannical motives; errors in judgment, or neglect; and\n\n9th.\u2014The remedies expedient to be applied to all such defects.\n\nAnd with respect to taking order for public affairs We do hereby authorize the Board at any sitting to be appointed and held as aforesaid to consider, deliberate, and resolve concerning all matters whatsoever of the general administration of the Kandyan Provinces on the motion of anyone of the Commissioners, excepting such matters as the Resident shall in the first instance or from time to time reserve to himself as secret and political. Provided, however, that no resolution of the Board be acted on or any measure carried into effect until the same shall have received the assent of the Resident, or in his absence from the Residency the Senior Commissioner present. Hereby reserving in the fullest manner to the Principal Accredited Agent or Resident, and in his absence from the Residency granting to the Senior Commissioner present, all political, superintending, and controlling powers which have at any time heretofore been lawfully exercised by the Principal Accredited Agent called Resident, and saving the laws, institutions, and customs of the Kandyan Provinces. Confirming also the Convention as explained and modified by Our\nProclamation dated the 31st day of May, 1816, and retaining all Our public acts and other orders in their full force, and calling the attention of the Board to all minutes and other documents of general instruction, and particularly to the matters of an address made by Us, the said Governor, to the assembled Chiefs at Kandy on the 20th day of May last.\n\nFor all which purposes and such others as shall from time to time be signified by instruction from Us, the said Governor, or by Our order, We do hereby appoint you Commissioners and to form a Board as before mentioned.\n\nColombo, the Thirtieth day of September, One thousand Eight hundred and Sixteen.\n\nBy order of His Excellency the Governor,\n\nJames Sutherland,\nSecretary, Kandyan Provinces.\n\n4. A discussion followed, in which Messrs. F. Lewis, R. C. Proctor, and the writer of the Paper took part.\n\nMr. Proctor: Will the difficulty which is met in defining the limits of \"Kandyan Provinces\" under our law be lightened by a strict interpretation of the word \"formerly\" in the phrase \"in the districts formerly comprised in the Kandyan Provinces\"? What limit of time was intended by our legislators to be fixed by the word \"formerly\"?\n\nIf the times when the Dutch ceded their territories to the British were intended, then the definition of Mr. Justice Dias may be accepted for practical purposes, i.e., \"so much of the Island as is not included in the Maritime Provinces.\" At the same time there were divisions that were neither under the Dutch nor under the dominion of Kandy, e.g., the Wanni district. This was not subjugated by the Dutch, and often served as a buffer. Kandyan law did not apply to this division.\n\nCan the word \"formerly\" refer to times anterior to the occupation of the Dutch?\n\nThe Portuguese documents extant are misleading and unreliable in the matter of defining limits of what then comprised the Kandyan Provinces. The Kandyan King was often addressed by them as Lord of Jaffna, Batticaloa, and of the Pearl Fisheries, when in fact he was not.\n\nThe political constitution of the Kandyan Provinces should throw some light on the subject. Even before the invasion of Ceylon by the European powers, the Kandyan Provinces did not represent a well-defined area. The village (Sin. gama) was not only a geographical, but also a social, ecclesiastical, and political unit. An association of several villages formed a K\u00f3ral\u00e9, two or more K\u00f3ral\u00e9s formed a Hatpattuwa, an association of Hatpattu formed\na Dissavony. These Dissavonies formed the Kandyan Provinces\u2014a Commonwealth\u2014the head of which was the Kandyan King. It was not uncommon for some Hatpattu or Dissavonies to break loose from the Commonwealth and set up independent principalities, so that the Kandyan Provinces expanded and contracted as the association of villages joined the confederacy or cut themselves away, according to events. The looseness of the tie between the villages and Dissavonies and the constitution will account perhaps for the difficulty of fixing the limits of the Kandyan Provinces at this date.\n\nOne fact is however clear, viz., that the distinction created by our law in the modes of proof prescribed in order to rebut the presumption in favour of the Crown between lands situated in Kandyan Provinces and elsewhere, is based on historical actualities. In Provinces which had come under the influence of European powers possession of lands was individualistic, while in the Kandyan Provinces it was socialistic. Hence the distinction.\n\nWhat limit of time is intended to be fixed by the word \"formerly\"?\n\nThe Hon. Mr. Arun\u00e1chalam: I take \"formerly\" to mean before the Proclamation of October 1, 1833.\n\n5. A vote of thanks to the Hon. Mr. Arun\u00e1chalam for his Paper was accorded, on the motion of Dr. A. Nell, and seconded by Mr. F. Lewis.\n\n6. The proceedings of the Meeting terminated with a vote of thanks to the Chair, proposed by the Hon. Mr. P. Arun\u00e1chalam and carried unanimously.\n\nCOUNCIL MEETING.\n\nColombo Museum, November 17, 1910.\n\nPresent:\n\nMr. P. Freudenberg, J.P., Vice-President, in the Chair.\n\nThe Hon. Mr. P.
