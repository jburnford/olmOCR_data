Yet Histories of Bengal are very few. From the Muhammadan side, though there are plenty of General Histories of India, containing incidental references to Bengal, or dealing with particular periods of it, there is no general or comprehensive History of Bengal, save and except the Riy\u0101zu-s-Sal\u0101\u1e6din. From the European side, the only standard History of Bengal is Stewart's History, but this last, too, whilst mainly based on the Riy\u0101z, incorporates also the less reliable accounts from Ferishta. To appreciate the historical value and position of the Riy\u0101z, I need only quote the opinions of two eminent Orientalists. \"The Riy\u0101zu-s-Sal\u0101\u1e6din,\" says the late Professor Blochmann who laboured so largely for the Asiatic Society of Bengal, \"is much prized as being the fullest account in Persian of the Muhammadan History of Bengal, which the author brings down to his own time (1786-88)\"; whilst Dr. H\u0153rnle observes in a letter to me: \"The Riy\u0101z is a Standard History of Bengal, is continually quoted by Mr. Blochmann in his 'Contributions to the History and Geography of Bengal' in the Journals of the Asiatic Society; Mr. Blochmann strongly recommended that it should be translated, and, therefore, the book is one which deserves being translated and published by the Asiatic Society.\"\n\nWhilst fully sensible of the honour conferred upon me by\nthe Asiatic Society in entrusting to me the duty of translating with notes this Standard History of Bengal, I cannot help confessing to a sense of diffidence in presenting this volume to the public under their auspices. Circumstances over which I have had little control, such as domestic troubles, difficulties of access to libraries or books of reference in out-of-the-way mofussil stations, and scanty snatches of leisure after by no means light daily official duties\u2014have combined not only to retard the publication of this annotated translation, but to interfere with my presenting it in the shape that I had fondly aimed at. As it is, I venture to think, whilst fully conscious of its defects and flaws, that I have spared no pains to render the translation a faithful and literal representation of the original, consistently with lucidity and clearness in statement. To constantly elucidate the text, I have given ample foot-notes. These foot-notes have been prepared by me by reference to original and generally contemporary Persian sources, and in some cases also embody results of the labours of European scholars and antiquarians, as well as my own personal observations. The preparation of these foot-notes has involved considerable research and entailed much labour.\n\nFor my labours, such as they have been, I shall, however, feel amply rewarded if these pages in any measure contribute to awaken amongst my co-religionists in Bengal an enlightened consciousness of their historic past, coupled with an earnest longing in the present to avail themselves of the opportunity afforded by a progressive and beneficent Government for their future social and intellectual regeneration; and also if they widen the mutual sympathies of the two great nationalities in Bengal by infusing sentiments of closer and more cordial comradeship, in that they have been fellow-travellers over the same tract for many long centuries; and last, though not least, if they evoke the sympathetic interest of Englishmen in the fate of a great and historic Community that preceded them for six centuries in the Government of this country.\nA respectful tribute of mournful acknowledgment is due to the memory of my lamented wife, Hyatunnissa Begam, who often sat up by me during progress of this work, and sustained me in my labours.\n\nABDUS SALAM.\n\nORISSA, CUTTACK:\n23rd May, 1903.\n\nP.S.\u2014I had hoped to add to this work an Appendix dealing with the social, economic and political condition of the people in Bengal under each period of Moslem Rule; but for this (though I have collected some materials) at present I command neither the requisite leisure nor the full critical apparatus. The foot-notes will, however, it is hoped, give the reader some idea of the culture and civilisation that prevailed in Bengal under the Moslems, of their system and methods of administration, of their policy in adding to the physical comforts of the people, and in improving their intellectual, social and ethical ideals.\n\nA.

Creatorship, and worlds of panegyric befit the shrine of that Supreme Author who has drawn by means of his brush of perfect art the portrait of Life in particoloured lines on the pages of Creation. He (God) is that Wise Sage, who has entrusted the affairs of the management of the world and the people of the world and the good and the right guidance of all classes to the persons of Sovereigns, and who has entrusted into the hands of authority of Sovereigns of this world, the reins of the opening and stoppage of the business of divers classes of mankind. He (God) is that Supreme Ruler of the Universe who, weighing the opening and stoppage of the affairs of mankind and the good and bad of Centre-Sitters in the circle of earth, in the scale of expediency of the world, has left in every clime and every country a ruler.\n\nFrom the Cloud of His bounty, the garden of the world is green.\n\nFrom the zephyr of His generosity, the orchard of the soil is green.\n\nFrom the Colouring of the painter of His Creation,\nEmerald becomes green in the centre of mine.\nPraise unto Lord, High is His rank and His praise.\nUniversal is His bounty and generosity,\nAll praise is due unto His Beneficence!\n\nAnd blessings full of white effulgence and sacred benedictions are due unto all the messengers of the Palace of His bounty, that\nis, unto the Prophets, especially unto that Symbol of Mercy of the people of the world, that Herald of the Faithful, that Seal of the Prophets, that Pioneer of the better Path, that Bright Lamp of the right road, the Raisond\u00e9tre of the creation of this world, the First-born: the Last-disclosed,\u00b9 that is, the Pride of the Prophets, the Leader\u00b2 of the Innocent, the Interceder on the day of Judgment, Muhammad the Chosen\u2014Ahmad the Select; God\u2019s special mercy and peace be on him and his descendants, and the people of his sacred house, and on his successors and all his companions!\n\nAfter God\u2019s and the Prophet\u2019s praise,\u00b3 this humble servant who is hopeful of the intercession of the Prophet, namely, Ghul\u0101m Husain, whose title is Salim Zaidp\u016br\u012b,\u2074 so says that since some period, according to chances of time, he has been in the service of Mr. George Udny, who is a gentleman of high position and high rank, of graceful character, of kind heart, mild disposition, praiseworthy deportment and great generosity, who is the \u1e24atim\u2075 of\n\n\u00b9 This has reference to the Muhammedan belief that the N\u0101r or light of Muhammad was the first thing created by God, and that all else followed, though the Prophet in bodily form was ushered into existence after all other prophets.\n\n\u00b2 This has reference to the tragic martyrdom of Husain and other members of the Fatimitite family, who were all innocent, and whose ancestor the Prophet was.\n\n\u00b3 Every Muhammedan book begins with the praise of God. This praise is called \u1e24amd in Arabic, and is followed by Na\u02bft, or praise of the Arabian Prophet.\n\n\u2074 Ghul\u0101m Husain Salim Zaidp\u016br\u012b is the author of the present historical work entitled the Riy\u0101z-e-Sal\u0101s\u012bn, or History of Bengal. Il\u0101h\u012b Bakhsh in his history \u201cKhurshid Jah\u0113n Num\u0101\u201d of which Mr. Beveridge has published lately an Analysis in the Journals of the Asiatic Society, has some notice of Ghul\u0101m Husain. He states that Ghul\u0101m Husain was of Zaidpur in Oudh, migrated to M\u0101ldah in Bengal, and held the office of D\u0101k Munshi or Post Master there, under Mr. George Udny. Noticing the Charitable Dispensary at M\u0101ldah, Il\u0101h\u012b Bakhsh observes that here used to be the house of Ghul\u0101m Husain, and that in the quarter known as Cak Qurb\u0101n \u0100l\u012b is the tomb of Ghul\u0101m Husain who died in 1233 A.H. or 1817 A.C. The chronogram composed in honour of his memory by his pupil, Abdul Karim, is \u0661\u0662\u0663\u0668 which yields 1238. Mr. Udny appears to have been at the time Commercial Resident of the East India Company\u2019s factory at M\u0101ldah.\n\n\u2075 \u1e24atim was a Prince of Yemen, in Arabia. His generous hospitality is a by-word in the East.\nthe world of bounty, the Naushirwan\\(^1\\) of the world of Justice, the Generous man of the age, and who is callous about popularity and praise\u2014\n\nMay God always preserve his good fortune, and advance his rank, and elevate his position, and double his life and dignity!\u2014and that he has been in the class of his servants, and has ever been and is still the recipient of his favours. In short, the excellencies-abounding and bounties-springing person of that mine of discernment, is unique and matchless in this age.\n\nHe is a paragon of all excellencies,\nHe is superior to all praise that can be conceived.\nHe is enlightened, sees through things aright, like old sages,\nBut he has the fortune, the age and the rank of manhood.\nHe weighs his words which are pregnant with meaning,\nHis two lips, like two palms, at the time of conversation,\nare pearl-scattering.\nThe tray of his bounty is ready for the poor and the needy;\nHe always keeps gold and dinar\\(^2\\) for the indigent.\n\nInasmuch as his high mind is always pursuant of the study of histories and travels, and is seeker of all sorts of knowledge and accomplishments, in the year 1200 A.H. corresponding to 1786 A.C., his bent of noble mind turned towards seeking a knowledge of the lives and careers of past sovereigns and rulers who unfurling the standard of sovereignty over Bengal, the Paradise of Provinces,\\(^3\\) have now passed into the secret regions of Eternity. Accordingly, the order was given to this man of poor ability, that whatever he might gather from historical works, &c., he should compile in simple language, so that it might be intelligible to all, and might deserve the approval of the elite. This\n\n---\n\n1 Naushirwan was a King of Ir\u0101n or old Persia. He flourished in the sixth century, and belonged to the Sassanian dynasty.

Naushirwan's justice is proverbial in the world.\n\n2 Dinar, a gold coin weighing one misqal, i.e., 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) dirhams. For details see Ain-i-Akbari, Vol. I (Blochmann's Trans., p. 36).\n\n3 Our author calls Bengal \"Jinnat-ul-bil\u0101d,\" or 'Paradise of Provinces.' I am not sure if there is any historical basis for this expression, as there is for the expression \"Jinnat-\u0101b\u0101d\" which latter epithet was bestowed by Emperor Humayun on Gaur in Bengal (see Tabaqat-i-Akbari, Elliot's History of India, Vol. V, p. 201, Ain-i-Akbari, Vol. II, p. 123, and Badaoni, Vol. I,\nignorant man, or limited capacity, deeming the execution of the order of his master incumbent on himself, being the slave of order, has placed the finger of consent on the eye, and girded up the loin of effort and venture, collected sentence after sentence from every source, and for a period of two years has devoted himself to the compilation and preparation of this history. And after completing it, he has named it Riy\u0101\u1e63u-s-Sal\u0101\u1e6d\u012bn, according to the date of its completion. It is hoped that this work may merit the approval of all persons of light. It is desired of people conversant with past times, that if they detect any mistake or oversight, they will overlook it, inasmuch as this humble man is not free from shortcomings, according to the saying \"Man is made up of sins of commission and omission,\" and further, that, according to their capacity, they will correct the mistakes and defects, and if they cannot do so, they will be good enough to overlook them.\n\nThe plan of this work consists of an Introduction and Four Chapters.\n\nIts arrangement is as follows:\u2014\n\n(a) The Introduction consists of Four Sections.\n\nSection I relates to a description of the state of populousness of the country of Bengal, and of its boundaries and environs.\n\nSection II relates to a description of certain characteristics of that country.\n\np. 349). However that may be, Bengal well deserved to be styled \"Jinnat-ul-bil\u0101d\" or 'Paradise of Provinces,' owing to the fertility of its soil, the richness of its produce, and the vastness of its natural resources. During Musalm\u0101n rule, the Province of Bengal yielded the largest revenue to the Delhi Emperors, and in consequence its Viceroyalty was always coveted by Princes Royal of Delhi, from so remote a period as the times of Emperors Shamsuddin Altamsh and Ghiyasuddin Balban\u2014whose sons in succession ruled over Bengal, not to speak of later Mughal Princes Royal of Delhi. Under British rule also, Bengal Proper, including Assam, Behar and Orissa and Chutia Nagpur, forms the largest Administrative Division of India, contains one-third of the total population of British India, and yields a gross revenue of 17 or 18 millions sterling, or one-third of the actual revenues of the Indian Empire. It is worthy of note that the above expression is also used in Mughal Imperial (official) documents, vide J.A.S.B. for 1901, Vol. LXX, Part I, No. 1, pp. 21-22.\n\n1 \"Riy\u0101\u1e63u-s-Sal\u0101\u1e6d\u012bn\" is a chronogram yielding date 1202 A.H., corresponding to 1788 A.C., the year in which this historical work was completed. 'Rauzah' in Persian means a 'garden,' its plural being 'Riy\u0101\u1e63,' meaning, 'gardens.' 'Sal\u0101\u1e6d\u012bn' means 'Kings'; therefore, 'Riy\u0101\u1e63u-s-Sal\u0101\u1e6d\u012bn' means 'gardens of Kings.' It is a pity the author does not specify all the sources\nSection III relates to a description of certain cities of that country.\n\nSection IV relates to a brief sketch of the rule of the Rai\u0101n of Hindust\u0101n.\n\nChapter I relates to a description of the rule of the Musalm\u0101n rulers who as Viceroys held delegated authority over this country from the Emperors of Delhi.\n\nChapter II relates to a chronicle of the Musalm\u0101n Kings who mounting the throne of Bengal, had the Khu\u1e6dbah\\(^1\\) of sovereignty recited after their own names.\n\nof his history, but there is internal evidence to indicate that, besides consulting standard historical works, such as Tabaq\u0101t-Na\u1e63iri by Minhaj-u-Siraj, Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi by Ziauddin Barni and by Siraj Afif (which contain references to the history of Bengal only for the period between 1198 to 1338 A.C.) and Tabaqat-i-Akbari by Nizamuddin Ahmad (which contains an account of Bengal for the period 1338 to 1538), the Badaoni and Akbarn\u0101mah by Abul Fazl (for the period under Akbar) and other similar standard historical works on India such as the Tuzuk, the Iqb\u0101ln\u0101mah, the P\u0101dsh\u0101hn\u0101mah, the Alamg\u012brn\u0101mah, and the Maasir-i-Alamg\u012br\u012b. Salim had recourse also to other less known historical treatises relating to Bengal which are not perhaps now extant, and perhaps lay only in MSS. Our author now and then says 'I have seen in a little book,' and he also cites a historical compilation by one Haji Muhammad of Qandahar, of which no copy seems now to exist. Our author appears also to have taken considerable pains in deciphering old inscriptions on monuments, mosques, and shrines in Gaur and Panduah\u2014old Musalm\u0101n capitals of Bengal. This feature considerably enhances the value of his history, and gives it a superiority over other similar works, and places our author in the forefront of Bengal antiquarians and researchers. Indeed, Ghul\u0101m Husain is pre-eminently the Historian of Muhammadan Bengal, because other Muhammadan historians before or after him dealt only with certain periods of Bengal history, whilst our author's narrative comprises the history of Bengal from the earliest mythological period to the dawn of British rule, with a more detailed account of Muhammadan Rulers of Bengal. Stewart's History of Bengal is to a great extent based on the 'Riy\u0101s' though Stewart very often has preferred the less accurate account of the Dakhin historian, Firishta, who flourished in the seventeenth century. The great Oriental scholar and antiquarian, Professor Blochmann, in his 'Contributions to the History and Geography of Bengal' says: \"The Riy\u0101s is much prized as being the fullest account in Persian of the Muhammadan History of Bengal.\" Professor Blochmann further observes \"for the early portions, Ghul\u0101m Husain Salim has used books which are unknown at present; yet he gives valuable dates which are often confirmed by collateral evidence. Salim has also made a fair use of the antiquities of the Gaur District.\"\n\n\\(^1\\) The Khu\u1e6dbah is a Musalm\u0101n prayer-book recited on Fridays, 'Id days, and\nChapter III relates to a description of the careers of the N\u0101zims who were appointed to the Niz\u0101mat of this country by the Caght\u0101'i or Mughal Emperors.\n\nChapter IV consists of two parts:\n\nPart I being descriptive of the arrival of the Christians, consisting of the Portuguese and the French, &c., in the Dakhin and in Bengal.\n\nPart II being descriptive of the domination of the English Christians over Bengal and the Dakhin.\n\nother special days and occasions. The recital of the Khutbah after one's name and the minting of coins, was regarded by Musalm\u0101n sovereigns as emblems of sovereignty.\n\n1 N\u0101zims\u2014\n\nThe N\u0101zims were functionaries created by the Mughal Government or by Sher Shah (Badaoni, Vol. I, p. 365). To each Province or \u0160\u016bbah, the Mughal Emperors appointed two Principal Heads of administration, one being the N\u0101zim and the other being the Diw\u0101n. The N\u0101zim was the Governor or Viceroy of the Province, he was the Executive and Military Head of the Province, and administered Criminal Justice; whilst the Diw\u0101n, though independent of the former and directly subordinate to the Delhi Emperor, held portfolio of the Finance, and was responsible for the revenue administration of the Province, and also occasionally administered Civil Justice. Thus there were two independent wheels in the machinery of Provincial administration. Under the N\u0101zims, there was a chain of subordinate officials, called Naib N\u0101zims, Serlashkars, Fanjdars, Kotw\u0101ls and Thanadars on the executive side, and under Diw\u0101ns on the judicial side, were Qazi-ul-Qazz\u0101t (Chief Justice), Qazis, Muftis, Mir Adla, Sadrs presided over by Sadr-i-Sadur, and on the revenue side were Naib or local Diw\u0101ns, Amils, Shiqdars, Karkuns, Qanungos, and Patwar\u012bs. The Judiciary, both Civil and Criminal, were often, however, independent of both N\u0101zims and Diw\u0101ns, and subordinate only to the Imperial Sadr-i-Sadur or Sadr-i-Kul or Sadr-i-Jah\u0101n (or Minister of Justice) at Delhi, who was responsible for good conduct to the Mughal Emperor himself. (See Ain, Vol. II, p. p. 87-49, and do. Vol. I, p. 268.)\n\n2 Caghtai Kh\u0101n was a son of Cangis Kh\u0101n. Emperor B\u0101bar, the founder of the Mughal dynasty in India, was descended on the mother's side from a nobler stock, that is, from Caghtai Kh\u0101n; hence the Mughal Emperors of India commonly styled themselves as Caght\u0101'i Emperors in preference to 'Mughal' Emperors, the term 'Mughal' not being so honourable, in accordance with an accepted usage and principle amongst Moslems to refer back their lineage to the nobler side, whether paternal or maternal.\nINTRODUCTION: CONSISTING OF 4 SECTIONS.\n\nSection I. A Description of the Boundaries and Environs of the Country of Bengal.\n\nBe it known to the way-farers of the climes of travels and histories that the \u0160\u016bbah of Bengal is in the second climate. From Isl\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d, otherwise known as Chittagong, to Teliagadhi, that is, from east to west, the length is 400 Karoh, and its breadth from north to south, that is, from the mountains in the north to\n\n1 The name of \u0160\u016bbah originated from the time of Emperor Akbar, who designated the fiscal areas as follows from the time of the ten-years' settlement:\u2014A \u0160\u016bbah was an aggregate of Sarkars, a Sark\u0101r or Division was an aggregate of Dast\u016brs, a Dast\u016br (which Sir Henry Elliot in his Glossary explains as an abbreviation of Dast\u016br-i-Aml, corresponding to a district under a Sark\u0101r) was an aggregate of Parganas or Mahals (used as equivalent expressions), and a Pargana or Mahal meant a fiscal division, the fiscal unit, coinciding with the dominions of a native chief under the Mughal dynasty. The words used before Akbar's time to denote fiscal divisions or tracts of country larger than the Pargana, were Shaq, Khatt\u0101h, \u2018Ar\u1e63\u0101l, Diyar, Vilayet, Iqta, Bil\u0101d and Mamlakat. Thus in the earlier Musalm\u0101n histories before the end of the fourteenth century, we come across Shaq-i-Sama, Khatt\u0101h-i-Oudh, \u2018Ar\u1e63\u0101l-i-Gorakpur, Diyar-i or Vilayet-i-Lakhnauti, Vilayet-i-Mean Doab, Iqta-i-Kara, Bil\u0101d Bang, Mamlakat Lakhnauti. See Elliot's Glossary, and Ain, Vol. II, p. 115, and Tabaqat-i-Nasiri, pp. 148 and 262.\n\n2 The Musalm\u0101n astronomers and geographers divided the world into seven parts, to each of which they gave the name of Iql\u012bm or climate.\u2014See Ain-i-Akbari Jarrett's Trans., Vol. III, p. 43.\n\n3 Isl\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d or Chittagong. The district was first conquered by the Independent Musalm\u0101n Kings of Bengal. In 1850 A.C., about which year Ibn Batutah was in Chittagong, it belonged to King Fakhruddin of Sunargon. It was re-conquered in 1665 by the Mughals under Umid Kh\u0101n who changed the name of the place to Isl\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d during the rule of Nawab Shaista Kh\u0101n, Viceroy of Bengal.\u2014See Blochmann's contributions to History and Geography of Bengal and the Alamg\u012br-Namah, p. 940, and the Ain, Vol. II, p. 126.\n\n4 Teliagadhi on Teliagarhi is a pass lying between Rajmahal on the south, and the Ganges on the north; formerly of strategic importance, as commanding the approaches to Bengal Proper. The ruins of a large stone fort still exist, through which the E.I. Railway passes. See Hunt. Imp.

And since in the period of Jal\u0101l-uddin Muhammad Akbar P\u0101dshah Ghazi, the \u0160\u016bbah of Orissa was conquered by K\u0101l\u0101pah\u0101r\\(^2\\) and annexed to the Empire of the Sovereigns of Delhi, and made a part of the \u0160\u016bbah of Bengal, the extent of the latter \u0160\u016bbah became extended by 43 karoh in length and by 20 karoh in breadth. In the southern limits of this \u0160\u016bbah is the sea, and towards its north and east, are high mountains, and on the west, it adjoins the \u0160\u016bbah of Behar. During the rule of Emperor Akbar, \u2018\u012as\u0101 Kh\u0101n\\(^3\\) Afghan conquering the eastern provinces struck coin and recited Khutb\u0101 in the name of Akbar, and annexed it to the \u0160\u016bbah of Bengal.

K\u0101l\u0101pah\u0101r was killed by a gun-shot in one of the fights between Mas\u016bm and Qutb of Orissa and \u2018Az\u012bz Kokah, which in 990 A.H., took place between Colgong and Gadh\u012b. A detailed description of K\u0101l\u0101pah\u0101r\u2019s conquest of Orissa is given in the Makhzan-i-Afghani.\u2014See Ain, Vol. I, p. 370 and Vol. II, p. 128.\n\n\\(^3\\) \u2018\u012as\u0101 Kh\u0101n Afghan flourished in \u2018Bhat\u012b\u2019 in the reign of Daud, the last Afghan King of Bengal, and continued as \u2018over-lord\u2019 or \u2018Marzb\u0101n-i-Bhat\u012b,\u2019 as Abul Fa\u1e93l in the Ain styles him, with twelve great Zemindars or princes (known in those days as B\u0101r\u0101 Bhuiy\u0101s) under him, after annexation of Bengal by Emperor Akbar to the Mughal Empire. \u2018\u012as\u0101\u2019s gadi was known as Masnad-i-Ali, the existing Diw\u0101n families of Haibatnagar and Jangalbari in Mymensingh district claim descent from \u2018\u012as\u0101. \u201cBhat\u012b\u201d according to Abul Fa\u1e93l extended 400 Kos from east to west, and 800 Kos from north to the ocean to the south; it thus included the Sundarban and the tracts along the Megna. Grant defines \u201cBhat\u012b\u201d as including the Sundarban and all the neighbouring lowlands (even Hijely) overflowed by the tides. The Musalm\u0101n historians never use the term Sundarban, but give the sea-board from Hijely to the Megna one name of \u201cBhat\u012b,\u201d which signifies lowlands overflowed by tides.\u2014See Ain-i-Akbari, Vol. I, p. 342, and J.A.S. No. 3, 1874, and No. 2, 1875 and Ain, Vol. II, p. 117.\n\n\\(^4\\) In the Ain, the \u0160\u016bbah of Bengal is stated to have consisted of 24 Sark\u0101rs including 787 mahals, and the revenue is stated to have been 59 Krors 84 lakhs 59 thousand and 19 d\u0101ms, equivalent to Rs. 14,061,482-15-7. Its standing army, according to the Ain, consisted of 23,330 cavalry, 801,150\nSark\u0101rs with eighty-seven mahals in this \u0160ubah\\(^1\\). In past times, the fixed revenue of this \u0160ubah was fifty-nine kror eighty-four lak, fifty-nine thousand and three hundred and nineteen dams, which is equal to about one kror forty-nine lak, sixty-one thousand four hundred and eighty-two rupees and fifteen annas in sicca Rupees. Twenty-three thousand three hundred and thirty cavalry, eight lak infantry, 1,170 elephants, 4,260 guns, 4,400 boats. Remembering that the army was not generally paid in coin, but by bestowal of fiefs or military jagirs, even at this distance of time, it is not difficult to imagine how Bengal was overrun by colonies of Musalm\u0101n feudal barons.\u2014See Ain-i-Akbari, Vol. II, p. 129 and Vol. I, p. 870.\n\n\\(^1\\) ON THE FRONTIERS OF MUHAMMADAN BENGAL.\n\nThe text as well as the Akbarnamah and the Iqbalnamah-i-Jahangiri state that Bengal was bounded on the south by the sea, on the north by hills (that is, those south of Nepaul, Sikkim, and Bhutan), on the east by hills (that is, those of Chittagong and Arakan), on the west by the \u0160ubah of Behar. During the reigns, however, of the Independent Musalm\u0101n Kings (such as Ilyas Shiah, and Alanddin Hussain \u0160ih\u0101h in 1502 and his son and successor Na\u1e63rat \u0160ih\u0101h), the Musalm\u0101n Kingdom of Bengal was more extensive than its geographical limits, and included northern portions of Orissa or J\u0101jagar, Kuch Behar, Kamr\u016bp or Western Assam with portions of Eastern Assam, and the whole of Upper Behar (a Governor to represent the Bengal Musalm\u0101n King being posted at H\u0101jipur opposite to Patna), and the eastern portions of South Behar including Sarkars Monghyr and Behar.\u2014(See J.A.S. No. 3, 1873, pp. 221-222). The whole of Orissa was conquered and annexed to the Bengal Musalm\u0101n Kingdom in the reign of Sulaiman Karar\u0101n\u012b, the last but one independent Musalm\u0101n Afghan King in Bengal.\n\nWhen Bakhtiy\u0101r Khilji conquered Bengal, he ruled (ostensibly as Viceroy of the Musalm\u0101n Emperor of Delhi, Kutbudin Aibak) over portions of Dinajepur, M\u0101ldah, Rangpur, Nadia, Birbhum, and Bardwan comprising what was then called Diyar-i-Lakhnanti, and also he held Behar (Tabaqat-i-Nasiri, p. 156). This state of things continued during the rule of his two immediate successors, when we find Husamuddin Iwas (a contemporary of Sultan Shamsuddin Altamsh) extending the frontier eastward to the Brahmaputra and southward to the sea-board, and reigning as an independent king under the title of Sultan Ghiasuddin (Tabaqat-i-Nasiri, p. 163). The Tarikh Firuz Shahi, p. 87 mentions that Emperor Balban in his pursuit of Mughisuddin Tughral, had to go so far eastward as Sunargnon, which would appear to have been within the limits also of Tughral\u2019s Bengal Kingdom. Again, in 1350 A.C., when Ibn-i-Bat\u016btah was in Chittagong, we find this important seaport was in the hands of King Fakhruddin of S\u016bnargnon. As Mr. Thomas in his learned discussions on old coins of Bengal Musalm\u0101n Kings has suggested, it would seem that so early as the twelfth century there was free commercial intercourse between the south-eastern sea-board of Bengal and the Arab seaports.\nand one thousand and one hundred and fifty-eight infantry, one hundred and eighty elephants, and four thousand two hundred and six guns, four thousand and four hundred fleet of boats, constituted the standing army. Adjoining to the northern limits of Chittagong, is the tract of country ruled by the Rajah of Tipperah. It is an extensive country. The rulers of that country enjoy the title of M\u0101nik, for instance Ny\u0101 M\u0101nik. The nobles have the title of Nar\u0101in.\u00b9 The R\u0101jah of that place had one thousand elephants and two laks of infantry in his service. Riding horses are not available. Between the north and the west of Bengal, pointing more towards the north, is the province of K\u016bch Beh\u0101r. Its length from east to west, from the beginning of Parganah Bhitarband,\u00b2 which is included in the conquered provinces, to P\u0101tag\u0101on,\u00b3 which is the limit of the tract of the M\u016brang, is 55 kos, and its breadth from south to north, that is, from Parganah N\u0101jh\u0101t, which is included in the conquered country, to P\u016bshakarp\u016br,\u2074 which adjoins Khont\u0101gh\u0101t,\u2075 is fifty kos. This tract of country, in point of the sweetness of its water, and mildness and salubrity of its air, and\n\nof Baghd\u0101d and Basorah; and it would seem it was this commercial Musalm\u0101n activity combined with superior martial and moral qualities that paved the way for Musalm\u0101n domination throughout Bengal.\n\nSubsequently in the reign of Ghiasuddin Tughlak Sh\u0101h, we find the Bengal Musalm\u0101n Kingdom has grown so extensive and unwieldy, that we find him separating Behar from Bengal, and placing it under an independent Governor, whilst Bengal itself for purposes of convenient administration was divided into three different sections, viz.: (1) Diy\u0101r-i-Sunargaon, comprising Eastern Bengal, (2) Diy\u0101r-i-S\u0101tgaon, comprising Western Bengal, and (3) Diy\u0101r-i-Lakhnanti, comprising Northern and Central Bengal. A Governor was appointed to each of the above three administrative Sections or Divisions, the Governor of Lakhnanti being the Supreme Governor or Viceroy, whilst the two other Governors were placed generally in subordination to him (Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi, p. 451). But this state of things did not last long; for in the reign of Muhammad Sh\u0101h Tughlak (Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi, p. 480) Bengal again rose as an Independent Musalm\u0101n Kingdom, and as has been mentioned above, the whole of Upper Behar with eastern portions of Southern Behar was again annexed to the Bengal Kingdom, whilst Orissa also was subsequently added to it. This state of things continued until Akbar came to the throne, when Bengal, with Behar and Orissa, was annexed to the Mughal Empire of Delhi. See Tabqat-i-Nasiri, Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi, Akbarnamah, Ibn-i-Batutah's Travels and Mr. Thomas's \"Initial Coinage of Bengal,\" J.A.S.B., No. 1, 1867 and No. IV, 1873 pp. 221-222 and 343.\n\n\u00b9 The same in Ain-i-Akbari, Vol. 2, p. 117.\n\u00b2 For identification of these places see J.A.S., 1872, p. 49.\nthe comfort of its inhabitants, is superior to all the eastern tracts of Hindust\u0101n. Large oranges thrive here, and other fruits also grow in abundance. The tree of pepper grows there, its root is thin, and its branches creep over ponds. Its ear, like the ear of grape, hangs down from the branches. Its inhabitants belong to two tribes, namely, Makh and K\u016bj, its R\u0101jah is of the first tribe. They mint gold coins, and the coins are called N\u0101r\u0101ni. Notable R\u0101jahs have ruled there. One lak and one thousand infantry are always in the service of the R\u0101jah.\n\nAnd the country of K\u0101mr\u016bp which is also called K\u0101mr\u016b \u00b2 or K\u0101mt\u0101h is subject to those R\u0101jahs. The inhabitants of K\u0101mr\u016bp are good-looking, and in magic raise the standard of mastery; and many incredible stories are related regarding them. In respect of the flora of that place, it is said that the scent of the flowers continues as fresh as before, some months after their being plucked, and that with these necklaces are made, and that by cutting trees a sweet liquid is obtained, and that the mango-tree trails like a climbing vine over ponds, and produces mango-fruit; and other similar stories are related.\n\nAnd the mountain of Bh\u016bt\u0101n, which is the abode of the Bh\u016bti\u0101hs, lies to south of K\u016bch Beh\u0101r. T\u0101ngan \u00b3 horses and Bh\u016bt and Bari horses and the musk-deer are found in this mountain.

Tuzuk p. 147, and Padshahnamah, p. 64, Vol. II.\n\n\u00b2 Kamr\u016bp (in Tabaqat-i-Nasiri, p. 163, Kamr\u016bd) included the Western portion of Assam together with the Bengal Districts of Rangpur, Rangmati (now in Goalpara District) and Sylhet. It was first conquered by Musalm\u0101ns in the reign of Hussamuddin Iwaz alias Sultan Ghiasuddin, an immediate successor of Bakhtiyar Khilji, in the early part of the thirteenth century. (Tabaqat-i-Nasiri, p. 163). At the close of the fifteenth century, its R\u0101jah Nelambhar was overthrown by Hussain Shih, King of Bengal. In ancient days, Kamr\u016bp was noted for its sorcery and the beauty of its women. Rangpur is stated to have been founded by Bakhtiyar Khilji, during his expedition into Tibet.\u2014See also J.A.S. for 1872, p. 49; Alamgirnamah, p.p. 678 and 780, makes it equivalent for Hajo (Koch Hajo) Gauhati and dependencies.\n\n\u00b3 \u201cTangistan\u201d is the general name for that assemblage of mountains which constitute the territory of Bhutan, \u201ctanga\u201d meaning \u2018defiles.\u2019 Abul Fazl also mentions these \u2018Tanghan\u2019 horses. He states: \u201cIn the lower parts of Bengal near to Kuch, a species of horse is produced called Tanghan.\u201d The tanga pony is usually 13 hands high and short bodied, deep in the chest, and very active.\ncentre of this tract, a river runs between two rocks, its breadth is small, but it is very deep, and its current is strong. An iron chain is put across the top of the river, and its ends are affixed to pieces of rocks on the two sides of the river, and a second chain is put over the first chain at a distance, equal to the height of a man. Pedestrians cross the river by placing their feet on the lower chain, and seizing with their hand the upper chain. And what is stranger is that horses and all other loads and baggage are ferried across this river along this very chain. The people of this tract are ruddy-complexioned and fat; their hairs fall hanging down their heads and necks. Their dress consists of only one rag, just sufficient to cover the private parts. Men and women of this place dress in the same manner. The pronunciations in their language resemble those of the people of Kuch Behar. It is said that mines of turquoise-stone also exist in this mountain.\n\nBetween the north and the east of the country of Bengal, bordering on the tract of Kamrup, is the vilayat or province of Asham (Assam). In its middle, the river Brahmaputra flows from east to west. Its length from west to east\u2014that is, from Gwahati to Sadih\u2014is about two hundred karoh or kos, and its breadth from north, that is from the rocky fastnesses of the tribes of Mari, Majmi, Daphla and Valandah, to the hills of the Nang tribe, is approximately seven or eight days' journey. Its southern mountains adjoin lengthwise the mountains of Khasia, Kachar and Kashmir, and breadthwise they adjoin Antan or Atwan, the abode of the Nauga tribe. Its northern mountain skirts lengthwise the lofty ridges of Kamrup, and breadthwise it faces the\n\n1 Tribes of Mari, Majmi, Daphla, and Vilandah and Nag.\u2014Vilandah or Landah tribe has been identified with the Akas tribe.\n\nAll these tribes belong to the Non-Aryan Tibet-Burman stock, which have clung to the skirts of the Himalayas, they crossed into India by the northeastern passes, and in pre-historic times they had dwelt in Central Asia, side by side with the ancestors of the Mongolians and the Chinese. The principal types of the Tibeto-Burman stock are the following:\u2014(1) Cacharis; (2) Garos, (3) Tipuras or Mrungs, (4) Bhutiyas, (5) Gurungs, (6) Marmis, (7) Newars, (8) Lepchas, (9) Miris, (10) Akas, (11) Mishmis, (12) Nagas; (13) Daphlas.\u2014See J.A.S for 1872, p. 76, Col. Dalton's \"Ethnology of Bengal\" and also description of Assam and the Assamese in Alamgirnamah, p. 722.\n\nThis seems to be a copyist's mistake for \"Goneser hills\" (see J.A.S. 1872, p. 761). The Alamgirnamah has Srinagar! p. 722.\nmountains of the Valand\u0101h tribe. The tract in the north of the river Brahmap\u016btra, from Gow\u0101h\u0101ti to the abodes of Mari and Majmi tribes, is called Uttarak\u016bl; and the extent of the Dakhink\u016bl is from the country of Naktir\u0101ni\u00b9 to village Sadi\u0101h. The climate of the lands bordering on the Brahmap\u016btra is for foreigners poisonous. For eight months the rainy season prevails, and the four months of winter are not free from rain. And the flowers and fruits of Hindust\u0101n and Bengal are available here; and besides these, others are found which are not to be had in Hindust\u0101n. Wheat, barley, and pulse are not grown, but the soil is fit for cultivation of all kinds. Salt is scarce and dear, and what is procurable from the defiles of some of the rocks is bitter and brackish. The fighting cocks of that country do not turn back face from enemies; though the adversary may be strong and big, they fight so much that the brain of the head becomes disturbed and they die. Large well-formed elephants abound in the wilds and the mountains. And plenty of deer, wild-goats, and wild-cows, and the horned fighting rams are also to be found. In the sands of the river Brahmap\u016btra, gold is found; twelve thousand Assamese are employed on this work. Every year one tola of gold per head is paid into the R\u0101jah's treasury. But the gold is not quite pure, so that one tola of gold sells for eight or nine rupees, and silver and gold coins are minted in the name of the R\u0101jah, and shells are current, but copper pice is not in use. Musk-deer is found in the mountains of Ash\u0101m. The bladder of musk is large, and full of large pieces of musk, and is beautiful-looking. The aloes-wood, which grows in the mountains of K\u0101mr\u016bp and Sadi\u0101h and Lakh\u016bgirah, is heavy and full of scent. No tax is levied from its subjects. From every house, out of every three persons, one person has to serve its R\u0101jah, and in serving him, shows no laxity, and if laxity is visible, he is killed. The R\u0101jah of that place dwells in a lofty building, and does not put his foot on the ground, and if he places his foot on the ground, he is deprived of his r\u0101j. And the people of this country have a false notion that their progenitors were in heaven, and that at one time fixing a ladder of gold they came down to the earth, and that since then they have dwelt on earth. Hence the R\u0101jah is called Sargi\u2014and \u2018Sarg\u2019 in the Hindi language means \u2018heaven.\u2019\n\n\u00b9 \u201cNaktir\u0101ni\u201d or \u201cNaktir\u0101ni\u201d has been identified with Deshr\u0101ni, a pergana of Kamrup.\u2014See J.A.S. for 1872, p. 76.\nthe R\u0101jahs of that country are powerful and notable. It is said that when the R\u0101jah of that place dies, his servants, male and female, with some conveniences and necessaries, and carpets and clothes and victuals together with a chir\u0101gh full of oil, are placed with him in a sepulchral monument, securely covered over with strong logs of wood.\\(^1\\)\n\nAnd adjoining to Assam (Ash\u0101m) is Tibet, and adjoining Tibet, are Khata and Machin.\\(^2\\) The capital of Khata is Khan B\u0101ligh,\\(^3\\) which is at a distance of four days from the sea. It is said from Khan B\u0101ligh to the seashore, a canal has been dug, and both sides of it have been solidly embanked. And in the mountains to the east of Ash\u0101m towards Utarak\u016bl, at a distance of fifteen days' journey, the tribes of Mari and Majmi dwell. In that mountain black deer and elephants are bred. Silver, copper and tin are procured from those mountains. The habits of those tribes (of Mari and Majmi) resemble those of the Assamese, and in beauty and refinement their females are superior to the women of Assam. They have a great horror for the gun, in regard to which they say: \"It is a wicked thing, it shouts out, but does not move from its place, and an infant comes out of its belly, and kills human beings.\"\n\nAnd between the south and east of Bengal, is situate a large tract called Arkhang (Arracan);\\(^4\\) Chittagong adjoins it. The male elephant abounds there, horses are scarce, and camels and asses can be had at high prices. And cows and buffaloes are not to be found there, but there is an animal resembling cows and buffaloes, and of brown colour, which yields milk. Their religion is distinct from Isl\u0101m and Hinduism. Barring their mothers, they can take all other women for their wives; for instance, a brother may marry his sister. And the people never remiss in their obeisance to the authority of their sovereign and chief whom they style\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) \"The account of the burial of Ahom magnates is confirmed by recent disclosures of desecrated graves.\"\u2014See J.A.S. for 1872, p. 82, footnote.\n\n\\(^2\\) China was long known to Asiatics under the name of Khutai or Khata or Khata and Machin.\n\n\\(^3\\) Khan Buligh is the name given to Pekin; it means the Court of the Great Khan. See D'Herbelot and Yule's Marcopolo.\n\n\\(^4\\) Arracan or the Magh country included Chittagong till a late period; it formed a great Buddhist Kingdom, whilst adjoining it on the north was the Hindu Kingdom of Tipperah.\u2014See Alamgirnamah, p. 940, wherein Arracan is called \"Rakhang,\" and its inhabitants are called \"Maghs.\"\n'Wali,' are always firm in their allegiance to him. Women-soldiers turn out at darb\u0101rs, whilst their husbands stay at home. The inhabitants are all black in colour, and their males do not keep beard.\n\nAnd adjoining to the country of Arkhang, is situate the country of Peg\u016b, between the south and east of Bengal. And the military force of that country consists of an elephant-corps and infantry. White elephants are found in its jungles, and on its boundaries are mines of minerals and precious stones; owing to this, enmity exists between the Pignans and the Arkhangians.\n\nAnd bordering on this tract is the country of Mag. The inhabitants are so many animals dressed up in human forms. They eat every animal of the earth and the sea that is procurable. They spare no animals. Their religion and law are all unsound. And they marry their sisters, born of different mothers. And the pronunciations of their language are similar to those of the people of Tibet.\n\nAnd in the southern limits of Bengal, is situate the vilayet of Odisah (Orissa). From L\u0101ndahdal\u016bl to M\u0101lwah and the passage of the Chilkah lake, are its limits. In the period of the sovereignty of Sult\u0101n Jal\u0101lu-d-din Muhammad Akbar Padsh\u0101h Ghazi, this country being conquered by K\u0101l\u0101pah\u0101r was entered in the Diwan-i-Akbari and annexed to the Niz\u0101mat of Bengal. And its short account is this, that K\u0101l\u0101pah\u0101r, who was one of the nobles of B\u0101bar and who was bold and could work miracles, under order of Muhammad Akbar Padsh\u0101h, engaged in conquering that country with 12,000 select cavalry.

They made constant raids in fleets of armed boats up the rivers of South-Eastern Bengal. During the Viceroyalty of the Mughul Viceroy of Bengal at Dacca, Nawab Shaista Kh\u0101n, these raids were considerably checked, and several of the Magh fleets were captured at the mouth of the Megna River, and the fort of Chittagong was also re-stormed. The Maghs were also expelled from the island of Sandip. A large number of Magh settlers are to be found still in Chittagong, Bakarganj, Noakhali and Tipperah. Though originally Buddhists, they have now intermixed with the people, and have become Hinduaised or semi-Hinduaised.\u2014See Alamgirnamah, p. 940.\n\n3 The first Muhammadan incursions into Jajnagar or Northern Orissa appear to have taken place about 1204 A.C., under Mahammad Shiran, an officer of\nthe ruler of that country, was very luxurious and given to indolence and ease. For six months he admitted the public to his audience, and attended to the management of the affairs of his country, and for six months he gave his body rest, and went to sleep. And if anyone awoke him during his period of slumber, he was sure to be killed. When the news of the arrival in that country of K\u0101l\u0101pah\u0101r with the Imperial forces, came to the ear of the Rajah, he built the fort of B\u0101rahb\u0101\u1e6d\u012b, which is a strong fort, for his security, and entrenched himself in it. And placing\n\nBakhtiyar Khilji, and subsequently under Hussamudin Iwaz, Tughan Kh\u0101n, and Tughrul (see Tabaqat-i-Na\u1e63iri, pp. 157, 163, 244, 262). Under Husain Sh\u0101h, Ismail Ghazi invaded also Jajnagar or Orissa, sacked the capital Cuttack and successfully stormed the holy city, Puri (see J.A.S. 1874, p. 215 and do. 1872, p. 335). The complete defeat of the Hindus took place in 1567-68 A.C., when Sulaiman Kararani, King of Bengal, with a large army under his famous General K\u0101l\u0101pah\u0101r advanced into Orissa and defeated the last independent Rajah Makand Deo under the walls of J\u0101jpur and Katak. When subsequently in Akbar\u2019s time the Afghan Kingdom of Bengal was supplanted by the Mughuls, the Afghans in large numbers migrated into Orissa. In 1575 A.C., a great battle took place between Mughuls and Afghans (at Bajhaura, Badaoni p. 193) at Mughalmari, near Jaleswar in Balasore, in which Daud, the last Afghan king, was defeated, and Orissa practically shortly after (1592 A.C.) became a Mughul Province, administered by the Mughul Viceroy of Bengal.\n\nIn the \u0100in, Abul Fa\u1e0dl mentions that the Hindu rulers of Orissa had the title of Gajpati, or Lord of the Elephant. In the time of Nawab Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n, Mughul Viceroy of Bengal, Orissa became the hunting-ground of Mahatta free-booters. The struggles between Ali Vardi and the Mahrattas are graphically described in the S\u0113\u012brul M\u016btakh\u0113r\u012bn. See Tabaqat-i-Na\u1e63iri, Tarikh-i-Firuz Sh\u0101hi, Akbarnamah and Makhzan-i-Afghani. Jajnagar is mentioned by Badaoni I, p. 233, as having been subdued by Ulugh Kh\u0101n in 1328 A.C. or 723 A.H., in Ghiasuddin Tughlak\u2019s reign, and is mentioned as having been subdued in 1360 A.C., by Firuz Shah Tughlak, Badaoni I, 248 and Tarikh Firuz Sh\u0101hi by Shams Seraj, p. 115. Seraj mentions that the idol of Jagannath was carried off to Delhi by Firuz Shah (p. 119).\n\n1 In the S\u0113\u012brul-M\u016btakh\u0113r\u012bn it is called B\u0101rahb\u0101\u1e6d\u012b. The fort of B\u0101rahb\u0101\u1e6d\u012b is on the south bank of the Mahanadi river, opposite to the city of Cuttack; it is now in ruins. The following description of it is translated and summarised by me from the Seir:\u2014\u201cThe fort B\u0101rahb\u0101\u1e6d\u012b with the city of Cuttack is situate on the strip of land lying between the rivers Mahanada and Kathajuri... The fort is on the bank of the Mahanada, and the circumference of its enclosing rampart is about three Kroh. The rampart is built of stone, brick, lime and cement, and a wide moat runs round the rampart. The city of Cuttack is situate on the banks of the Kathajuri river, and the distance between the fort and the city is about two Kroh...\u201d\nproper forces for encountering the enemy, he himself, according to his old habit, went to sleep. K\u0101l\u0101pah\u0101r, by successive and numerous fightings, vanquished the Rajah's forces, and brought to his subjection the entire dominion of Odisah (Orissa), so much so that he carried off the Rani together with all household goods and chattels. Notwithstanding all this, from fear of being killed, no one was bold to wake up this drunkard of the sleep of negligence, so that K\u0101l\u0101pah\u0101r had his hands free. After completing the subjugation of the entire country, and investing the Fort of B\u0101rahb\u0101\u1e6di, which was his (the Rajah's) place of sleep, K\u0101l\u0101pah\u0101r engaged in fighting. The officers and employes of the Rajah summoning his clarion-players communicated the news of the whole affair through the reed of the clarion. When the news about K\u0101l\u0101pah\u0101r went to the ear of that fortune-sleeper on the bed of sleep, which is brother of death, considering this affair as the event of the Day of Judgment, like the sleepers in graves, from the sound of the trumpet, sprang confounded from the sleep of oblivion, and making the movement of a slaughtered animal, devoted his head to the swords of the warriors of Isl\u0101m. The country of Orissa and the fort of B\u0101rahb\u0101\u1e6di being subjugated, were added to the dominions under the sovereignty of the Musalman Emperors. The firm Muhammadan religion and the enlightened laws of Isl\u0101m were introduced into that country. Before this, the\n\n1 This was Rajah Mukund Deva, Haricandara, who reigned from 1560 to 1568. Mukund Deva was a Telugu by birth. In 1564-65 A.C., a treaty was concluded between Emperor Akbar and the Rajah, preceded by mutual despatch of ambassadors on both sides (see Badaoni p. 76, wherein it is stated that Hasan Khan Khazanohi and Mah\u0101puter where sent by Akbar as ambassadors to the Rajah of Orissa). As mutual jealousies prevailed between Mughuls and Afghans, this political measure was adopted by Akbar, in order to serve as a counterpoise to the ambition of the Musalman Afghan King of Bengal, Sulaiman Karrar\u0101m, who had planned to extend his Bengal Kingdom by annexing Orissa and also to prevent the latter from helping Akbar's rebellious Governor of Taunpur, named Khan Zaman. Finding shortly after Akbar engaged in wars in the west, Sulaiman Kararani, the King of Bengal, attacked the Orissa Rajah, who had come close to the Ganges; the Rajah fled to Fort Kotsama. The Bengal King detached a force under K\u0101l\u0101pah\u0101r, his general, to Orissa across Mayurbhanja and thence southward by the Kacabasa river. K\u0101l\u0101pah\u0101r ravaged Orissa, defeated the Rajah's deputy, and shortly after the Rajah himself was killed, and Muhammedans finally conquered Orissa in 1568 A.C. After conquering Orissa, Sulaiman Kararani (who reigned from A.C. 1568 to A.C. 1572) left his Vazir, Khan Jahan Lodi, as Viceroy of Orissa with headquarters at Cuttack, and Q\u016btl\u016b as Governor at Puri. (Badaoni II, 174).\nMusalman Sovereigns exercised no authority over this country. Of the miracles of K\u0101l\u0101pah\u0101r, one was this, that wherever in that country, the sound of his drum reached, the hands and the feet, the ears and the noses of the idols, worshipped by the Hindus, fell off their stone-figures, so that even now stone-idols, with hands and feet broken, and noses and ears cut off, are lying at several places in that country. And the Hindus pursuing the false, from blindness of their hearts, with full sense and knowledge, devote themselves to their worship!\n\nIt is known what grows out of stone:\nFrom its worship what is gained, except shame?\n\nIt is said at the time of return, K\u0101l\u0101pah\u0101r left a drum in the jungle of K\u0113onjh\u0101r, which is lying in an upset state. No one there from fear of life dares to set it up; so it is related.\n\nAnd Jaggann\u0101th, which is a big temple of the Hindus, is in this S\u016bbah. It is said when the Hindus reach Pars\u016btam, where Jaggann\u0101th is, in order to worship Jaggann\u0101th, first they shave their heads like Musalmans, and at the first door of the house of Shaikh Kabir, who was a great saint of his time and whose parents were weavers, they eat and drink his food and water,\n\n1 This is not strictly correct. See note 7, p. 3 ante.\n2 Professor Blochmann has surmised that K\u0101l\u0101pah\u0101r was originally a Hindu who embraced Islam, from the circumstance that his proper name was Raju. Mr. Beveridge in his Analysis of Khurshid Jahan Numa has followed in Professor Blochmann's wake. I see no warrant for this surmise. The Makhzan-i-Afghani and the Akbarnamah, contemporary records, would not have failed to notice this fact, if it were so; for it would have been a matter of additional exultation to the Musalman historians. The text describes him as one of the \"Omrah of Babar\"; and Babar never dreamt of the policy of his grandson, Akbar, to employ Hindus in high military capacities or to make them his \"Omra.\" Furthermore, the name Raj\u016b is current amongst Musalmans. (See Blochmann's \u0100in, Vol. I, which mentions one Syed Raj\u016b of Barha and Badaoni, p. 328, Vol. 2, and \u0100in, Vol. 2, p. 371): Bad\u012bn\u012b, too, in the Muntakhih-i-Taw\u0101rikh (p. 42, Vol. 1), mentions Kalapahar as a brother of Sikandar Sh\u0101h (alias Ahmad Kh\u0101n S\u016br of Sher Sh\u0101h's family) who occupied Bihar as tuyul under Akbar. (The Makhzan-i-Afghani gives a full description of Kalapahar's conquest. He was killed in 1582 A.C. in a fight with Aziz Kokah between Colgeng and Rajmahal.\n\n3 Shaik Kabir flourished about the beginning of the 15th century during the rule of Independent Musalman Kings in Bengal. He was the leader of a great theistic movement, the object in view being to harmonise Musalman and Hindu religions, and to teach votaries of both the great religions of India that they were after all children and worshippers of one God, that the Allah\nwhich is called in the language of that country tar\u0101nt. After having done so, they proceed to worship their God of Jaggann\u0101th. At Pars\u016btam, Hindus unlike their practice elsewhere, eat together with Musalmans and other races. And all sorts of cooked food sell in the bazar, and Hindus and Musalmans buy them and eat together and drink together.\n\nSECTION II.\u2014DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE COUNTRY OF BENGAL.\n\nBe it known to the appraisers of the pearls of past chronicles that most of the historians have narrated that when H\u0101m, son of Noh (Noah) the prophet (may he be in peace!), with the permission of his holy father, set himself to colonize the south, he girded up his loin for accomplishing this, and deputed his sons\u2014the first of whom was Hind, the second Sind, the third Habash, the fourth Zanaj, the fifth Barbar, and the sixth Nubah\u2014in all directions on colonizing expeditions. And the tract that each of them colonized was called after him. The eldest son, Hind, having come to the country of Hind\u016bst\u0101n, it was so named after him. And Sind in the company of his elder brother, having set himself to colonize the tract of Sind established himself there, and that was named after him. But Hind had four sons, the first was P\u016brab, the second was Bang, the third was Dakin, and the fourth was Naharw\u0101l. And every tract that was colonized by each, is still called after him. And Dakin, son of Hind, had three sons, and the country of Dakin was parcelled between them. Their names were Marh\u0101t, Kan\u0101r, and Talang; and Dakhinans are all descended from him, and up to this time all the three tribes dominate there.\n\nAnd Naharw\u0101l had three sons, namely, Babruj, Kanoj and M\u0101lr\u0101j. After them cities were also named.\n\nof Musalmans is the Parmeshur of the Hindus, that they ought to be tolerant of each others creeds, and to regard each others as fellow-brethren. The labours of Kabir may be placed between 1380 and 1420 A.C., and reflect not only credit on him, but illustrate what ethical and spiritual progress took place amongst the people of India under the impact of Isl\u0101m. It may be added that on Kabir's death, both Hindus and Musalmans claimed his body; so catholic and liberal was he in his views. This great theistic movement set on foot by Kabir, received expansion in the following century by the labours of Chaitanya, the Nuddea leader of Vishnuism, in Bengal who flourished in the reign of Sultan Alan-d-d\u012bn Husain Sh\u0101h, King of Bengal.\nAnd P\u016br\u0101b, who was the eldest son of Hind, had forty-two sons, and, within a short time, their descendants multiplied and colonized different countries, and when they became numerous, they raised one of themselves to be the chief and to look after the management of the realm.\n\nAnd Bang, the son of Hind, getting children born to him, colonized the country of Bengal. The name of Bengal was originally Bang. And the reason why the word al was added to it, is this: al in the Bengali language means an 'embankment' or raised ground, which is placed round a garden or cultivation, so that floods may not enter it. As in ancient times, the chieftains of Bengal on lowlands which were situate at the foot of hills, used to raise mounds about ten cubits high and twenty cubits broad, and to make homes, cultivations, and buildings within them, people used to call this country B\u0101ng\u0101l\u0101h.\u00b9 The climate of Bengal is temperate, and owing to proximity to the sea and owing to heavy rains, is very damp. The rainy season begins from the month of \u016ardi Bihisht,\u00b2 which in Hindi is called Jaet, and for six months the rains continue; this is unlike other parts of Hindust\u0101n, where rains set in from the middle of the month of Khurd\u0101d, which the Hindis call \u0100s\u0101r and last till Shahriwar which Hindis call \u0100sin, for four months. In the rainy season, the lowlands of Bengal get flooded, and the climate becomes bad, especially towards the end of the rainy season. Human beings as well as animals become sick and die. The soil contains much damp, so that in many places they build two-storeyed buildings, made of lime and brick. Notwithstanding that they make the floor of lime and brick, the lower rooms are not fit for habitation, and if any one lives there he soon falls sick. And owing to excessive humidity, the soil of Bengal has much power of sprouting, for instance, some sorts of paddy, in proportion to the rise of water, so long as they are not inundated, shoot\n\n\u00b9 Abul Fa\u1e0dl similarly in the Ain-i-Akbar\u012b explains the origin of the term Bangalah. (See Jar. Tr., p. 115, Vol. II). In the Tabaqat-i-Nasiri, the expression \"Bang\" is invariably used. In the Tarikh-i-Firuz Sh\u0101hi, the expression \"Bangalah\" or \"Bengal\" is used.\n\n\u00b2 The Persian Calendar consists of twelve solar months, named (1) Farvardin (March), (2) Ardibah\u0161t (April), (3) Khurdad (May), (4) Tir (June), (5) Murdad (July), (6) Shahr\u012bwar (August), (7) M\u012bhr (September), (8) Ab\u0101n (October), (9) \u0100d\u0101r (November), (10) Di (December), (11) Bahman (January), (12) Sepehrd\u0101maz (February). See Richardson's Pers. Dict. and also Ameer Ali's History of Sarcens, p. 316.\nforth higher up and their ears do not sink under water, and similarly from one paddy-seed two or three seers of paddy are obtained in the case of certain sorts of paddy. And most of the lands grow three crops in a year. And the crop of that country is all paddy, whether fine or coarse. Other crops, such as wheat, barley and pulse, &c., are scarce. And strange to say the paddy crop grows in so much abundance that it needs not the rains in dry months nor the water of wells and rivers. But in cases of drought in the rainy season, the paddy crop is totally destroyed.\n\nThe dwellers in villages are loyal and submissive to their rulers, and unlike the Zemindars and tenants of other provinces of Hindustan, they do not fight with their rulers. They pay in the land revenue of each year in eight instalments in eight months, and the tenants personally pay their rents at the Kacheris. The appraisement of each crop is based on nasaq\u2014and nasaq is a document which remains with the muhrir and the patwari and the Karkun, with the seal of amil. But in affairs relating to bargains of giving and taking and purchases and sales and other worldly matters, no race in all the four quarters of the globe is equal to the Bengalis in wickedness, duplicity, knavery and villainy. They do not consider loans repayable, and the promises which they pledge to perform in one day, they do not fulfil in one year. And the food of the natives of that kingdom, from the high to the low, are fish, rice, mustard oil and curd and fruits and sweetmeats. They also eat plenty of red chilly and salt. In some parts of this country, salt is scarce. The natives of this country are of shabby tastes, shabby habits and shabby modes of dress. They do not eat breads of wheat and barley at all. Meat of goats and fowls and clarified-butter do not agree with their system. And there are many amongst them who, if they eat the same, cannot digest them, and vomit them out. The dress of both males and females,\n\n1 Graphic descriptions of famines in India in past times will be found in the Tariikh-i-Firuz Shahi, Badaoni, and the Maasir-i-Alamgiri.\n2 Abul Fazl in the Ain says:\u2014\"The harvests are always abundant, measurement is not insisted upon, and the revenue demands are determined by estimate of the crop. His Majesty Emperor Akbar in his goodness has confirmed this practice.\" (See Ain-i-Akbari, Vol. 2, pp. 121-122).\n3 \"Muhrir\" is a clerk.\n4 'Patwari' = Village Accountant.\u2014This functionary flourishes even now.\n5 \"Karkun\" was a supervisor over village patwaris,\u2014he was an Imperial officer in charge of the accounts of a pargana. The \"Karkuns\" were in turn supervised by 'Amils' in charge of an aggregate of parganas or...\nof both the upper and lower classes, consists of one strip of cloth just sufficient to cover the private parts. The males wear one white strip of cloth, called generally a dhoti, which is tied from below the navel down to the leg, and a small turban about two or three cubits long is tied on the side of the head, so that the whole skull of the head and the hair are visible. And the females wear one strip of cloth called a sari, half of it is wrapped round from below the navel to the leg, and the other half being drawn across a side is thrown down the neck. They are bareheaded, and do not wear any other cloth; nor do they wear shoes and stockings. Both males and females daily rub mustard oil over their bodies, and bathe in tanks and rivers. The Bengali females do not observe pardah, and go out of their houses for the performance of evacuations and other household duties. And the wildness and habitation of this country are similar, in that the people erect huts of thatch, made up of bamboos and straw. Their utensils are generally earthen, and few are of copper. Whenever quitting one place they migrate to another, straightway they erect a thatched hut, similar to their former one, and collect earthen utensils. Most of their habitations are in jungles and forests, so that their huts are encircled with trees. And in case one of the huts catches fire, all the huts are burnt down, and after the conflagration they get no trace of their habitations, except through trees which surrounded their huts. Most of them travel by water, especially in the rainy season, in which season they keep boats, small and large, for journeys and for going to and fro. For travelling by land, they have conveyances, such as singhasan and palki and jowalah. Elephants are captured in some parts of the country; good horses are not procurable, and, if had, they cost much. A curious sort of boat is made in this country for capturing forts. And it is in this wise: the boat is large, and\n\ndistrict. Here we get a glimpse of the old fiscal system in regard to its account-branch. In the collection-branch of the Musalman fiscal system, Shiqdars (corrupted into Hindu family names Sikdars) presided over Mahals, Majmuahdars (corrupted into Hindu family names of Mozumdars) presided over a group or circle of Mahals or a Turf, and over an aggregate of Mahals or Turfs, corresponding to a modern District, an Amil presided, and over an aggregate of Districts or a Division, the Districts, there was a local Diwan. The last two functionaries were generally Musalmans, whilst the first two subordinate functionaries were almost invariably Hindus.\n\n1 \"Singhasan\" of our author corresponds to Abul Fazl's \"Sukhasan\" in the Ain. (See Ain-i-Akbari, Vol. 2, p. 126).\nthe prow of it, which is called in the dialect of the country galh\u00ee, is made so high that when it is placed alongside the wall of a fort, people from the boat can get on to the wall from it, and enter the fort. And a kind of carpet is manufactured from the linseed plant, which is very pretty and much liked. And precious stones, pearls, jasper, and ruby do not exist in this country. From other countries these are imported into the ports of this S\u00fbbah. And the best fruit of this country is mango, which in some parts is large, sweet, and without strings, and tasty, and has a small stone. And the tree of three years' growth\u2014of the height of a man\u2014bears fruit. And large oranges, which are called kaunla, and small oranges, which are called n\u00e2rang\u00ee, grow well in this country. And varieties of citrons are available. And lemons, pineapples, cocoanuts, betelnuts, palm-fruits, jack-fruits and plantains have no end. And grapes and melons, &c., do not grow here; though the seeds of melons and grafts of vines have been often planted in this country, they have never thrived. Sugarcanes, good, delicate and sweet, red, white and black in colour, grow here in abundance; ginger and pepper in some parts grow abundantly, and betel leaves also grow in abundance, and silk is also produced well and in abundance here. Good silk-stuffs are manufactured in this country, and cotton-fabrics of good quality are turned out here. Rivers, small and large, are plenty in this country, and the practice of digging tanks is very common. People in this country seldom drink the water of wells, because everywhere the water of tanks and rivers is found in abundance. And generally the water of wells is salt, but with a little digging of the soil water comes out.\n\nAnd the best of rivers is the Ganges (Gang), which rises from the northern mountains of Hind\u00fbst\u00e2n at the point called Gonmukh\u00e2h, flows through the provinces of Hind\u00fbst\u00e2n, Farrakh\u00e2b\u00e2d, Al\u00e2h\u00e2b\u00e2d, and Beh\u00e2r into Bengal, and in Bengal at a place called Q\u00e2zih\u00e2t\u00e2,\u00b9 within the Sark\u00e2r of B\u00e2rbak\u00e2b\u00e2d, it is named Padd\u00e2. From this place, a branch of the Ganges separates, flows down Murshid\u00e2b\u00e2d, and at Nadi\u00e2h joins the Jalangi river, and then flows into the sea. This branch is called Bh\u00e2griati, and it goes towards Chittagong, flowing through the sea. The Ganges at Al\u00e2h\u00e2b\u00e2d joins the rivers Joun (or Jamn\u00e2) and S\u00fbrsati, and near\n\n\u00b9 Q\u00e2zih\u00e2t\u00e2 mentioned by Abul Fa\u017cl in the Ain and quoted by our author appears to be Hajrah\u00e2ti, on the left bank of the Podda, now also a ferry place, near the entrance of the Bur\u00e2l river, below Ramp\u00fbr Boalia.\nH\u0101jipur it unites also with the Gandak, the Sar\u016b and the Son, and becomes very broad. And the place where the three rivers unite is called Tirbini by Hindus, and its sanctity in the eye of the Hindus is immeasurable. And the Ganges, Sursati, and Joun or (Jamu\u1e63), in flowing towards Chittagong and the sea, branch off in a thousand rivulets. And Hindus have written volumes on the sanctity of these rivers. Considering the water of these rivers sacred, they fancy that bathing there washes off the sins of a lifetime; especially bathing at certain gh\u0101ts of the Ganges, such as Benaras, Alahabad, and Hardwar, is regarded as very sacred. The rich amongst the Hindus, getting their supplies of the Ganges water from long distances, take particular care of it, and on certain auspicious days, worship the same. The truth of the matter is, that the water of the Ganges, in sweetness, lightness, and tasteness has no equal, and the water of this river, however long kept, does not stink. There is no river bigger than it in Bengal.\n\nAnd another of the big rivers of Bengal is the Brahmaputra, which flows from the regions of Kha\u1e6da towards Koch, and thence by the way of B\u0101z\u016bh\u0101 flows down into the sea. In the environs of Chittagong, it is called the Megna. The smaller rivers are countless. On both banks of most of the rivers, paddy is cultivated. Another feature of this country, unlike that of other countries of Hindustan, is that they cut grafts of mango and lemon-trees, and plant them, and these, in the very first year, bear fruit.\n\nSECTION III.\u2014RELATING TO A DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN TOWNS AND FOUNDATION OF CERTAIN CITIES IN THE COUNTRY OF BENGAL.\n\nThe city of Lakhnauti, which in past times was the Capital of Bengal, was founded by Sangaldib. It is said that at the time when Fir\u016bz R\u0101i, the R\u0101jah of Hindustan, being defeated by Rustam Dastan,1 fled to T\u012br\u1e25\u016bt, and from there fleeing to the mountains of Jharkhand2 and Gondw\u0101rah,3 died, Rustam Dastan, who\n\n---\n\n1 Dastan was the title of Rustam, the Persian Hercules\u2014otherwise called Rustam Zal.\n2 \"Jharkhand\" was the name by which, what we now call, \"Chutia Nagpur\" was known in Muhammadan times; whilst \"Bharkundah\" denoted \"Sonthal Parganas including Birbhum.\"\n3 I think \"Gondw\u0101rah\" in the text here is a copyist's mistake for \"Gondwanah\" which has been identified with the \"Central Provinces,\" of which the capital is Garha-Katanga (Jabalpur).\nwas displeased with his insolence, not bestowing the kingdom of Hind\u016bst\u0101n on the R\u0101jah's children, awarded the sovereignty of Hind\u016bst\u0101n to a Hindu, named S\u016braj.\u00b9 S\u016braj became a powerful R\u0101jah, subjugated the kingdom of the Dakhin and also the kingdom of Bengal. When S\u016braj died and the sovereignty passed to his son, Bahraj, disturbances occurring in all parts of the kingdom, ambition showed itself in every head, and at length a Brahmin, named K\u0113d\u0101r, coming out from the mountains of Saw\u0101lik, and becoming victorious after fightings possessed himself of the reins of sovereignty. Towards the end of his reign, a person named Sangal-dib,\u00b2 emerging from the environs of Kuch, which adjoins the limits of Bengal, brought to his subjection, first, the countries of Bengal and Beh\u0101r, and then fighting against K\u0113d\u0101r became victorious, and building the city of Lakhnauti,\u00b3 made it his capital. And for\n\n\u00b9 It is worthy of note that there is a town called S\u016braj-garh (or fort of S\u016braj) in Monghyr district, on the southern banks of the Ganges, and close to Maulanagar, where there is also an old Muhammadan Khanqah founded by Mahabat Jang.\n\n\u00b2 In Firishta, \u2018Shangal.\u2019 In the list of Hindu kings given in the \u0100in-i-Akbari, I do not find this name.\n\n\u00b3 The authentic history of the city begins with its conquest in 1198 A.C. (594 A.H.) by the Muhammadans, who made it their first capital in Bengal. (See Tabaqat-i-Nasiri, p. 161, Pers. Text). This was the period when were erected numerous mosques and other Muhammadan buildings. (See Hunt. Imp. Gazetteer, Vol. III, p. 338, also Ravenshaw\u2019s and Creighton\u2019s \u201cRuins of Gaur\u201d). When the Muslim kings of Bengal established their independence, they transferred the seat of government to Sunargoon and Pandnah. Pandnah was soon after deserted, and the royal residence re-transferred to Gaur, whilst Sunargoon continued as capital of East Bengal. Minhajus Siraj visited the city in 641 H. or 1245 A.C., and gives an account of it in his Tabaqat-i-Nasiri. (p. 162, Pers. Text) Ab\u016bl Fa\u1e0dl in the \u0100in notices it (see p. 123, Vol. 2, \u0100in, Jar. Tr.), and states that the city was known in his time both as Lakhnauti and Gaur, and that the latter epithet was changed to \u201cJinnatabad\u201d by Emperor Hum\u0101yun. Badaini (p. 58, Vol. 1, Pers. Text) states that Bakhtiyar Ghori founded a city and named it after himself \u2018Gour.\u2019 The capital was shifted in Sulaiman Kararani\u2019s time further westward to Tandah. During the conquest of Bengal by the Mughuls under the Emperor Akbar, Gaur again became the headquarters of the Mughul Government, and the Mughul Imperialists under Munaim Khan, Khan-i-Khanan, the first Mughul Viceroy of Bengal, occupied it. A pestilence, however, broke out, in course of which Munaim died\u2014and also thousands of troops and people daily (see pp. 318 and 376, \u0100in, Vol. 1, Bloch\u2019s Tr. and Badaoni, Vol. 2,\ntwo thousand years it remained the Capital of Bengal. In the time of the Mughul Emperors it became ruined, and instead of it Tand\u0101h became the Viceregal Capital. Afterwards Tand\u0101h was also ruined, and Jah\u0101ng\u012brnagar, and lastly Murshid\u0101b\u0101d, became the Viceregal Capital. The reason for the name of Gaur is unknown, but it is guessed that in the period of the rule of the sons of Nojgoriah, perhaps this name was given. And Emperor Hum\u0101yun, considering Gaur an inauspicious name, changed it to Jinnat\u0101bad. This city at present is in complete ruin, and has become the haunt of lions and tigers. Excepting traces of gates of the fort, and dilapidated buildings, and the mosque, and foundations of the building of Qadam-Ras\u016bl, nothing else exists.\n\nThe place where monarchs dwelt in gardens with friends,\nHas become the abode of crows and vultures and the haunt\nof lions and jackals!\n\nGaur contained a large fort, traces whereof are still visible. On the eastern side of the city are the lakes of Jhati\u0101h and Bhati\u0101h and other lakes, and the embankment continues from that to this time, though it was stronger and kept out the flood of water in the rainy season, when the city was in a flourishing condition. At present, in the rainy season, boats pass across it, and everything is inundated. Towards the north of the Fort, to the dis-\n\np. 217), and the Mughul metropolis of Bengal was removed to Tand\u0101h, and thence shortly after to Rajmahal or Akbarnagar, which remained the capital of Bengal, until it was removed to Dacca or Jahang\u012brnagar, and lastly to Murshidabad. Dr. Buchanan-Hamilton places the inhabited area of Gaur at 20 square miles, containing over 600,000 souls. The author of Khurshed Jahannuma notes the following principal buildings as still existing:\n\n1. The Qadam-Ras\u016bl, a square, one-domed building in the enclosure of the Fort, erected by Sultan Nasrat Sh\u0101h, son of Sultan Allaudin Husain Sh\u0101h in 937 A.H. (1530 A.C.).\n\n2. The Minar, north-east of the Qadam-Ras\u016bl, built by Sultan Firuz Sh\u0101h. The height of the Minar is about 50 cubits, and its circumference about 5 cubits. Firuz reigned in 893 A.H. (1487 A.C.).\n\nWhen I visited Gaur from Maldah in 1887 I found also portions of the rampart, the gateway, and the Qadam-Ras\u016bl building yet extant.\n\n1 The embanked road a bridge is described in Tabaqat-i-Nasiri (p. 162). It connected Lakhnauti with Lakhnur in Bar on the western side, and Lakhnauti with Deocote in Barind on the eastern side, and was constructed by Hussamuddin Iwuz aliss Sultan Ghiasuddin.\ntance of one kos, a large building of ancient times existed, and also a tank called Pe\u0101sb\u0101ri\u2014the water whereof was noxious, whoever drank it became attacked with bowel-diseases and died. It is said that in past times, criminals were imprisoned in that tank, and by drinking the water of it they immediately died. And Emperor Akbar, taking pity, put a stop to this form of punishment.\n\nCITY OF MURSHID\u0100B\u0100D.\n\nThe city of Murshid\u0101b\u0101d\u00b9 is a large town situate on the banks of the river Bh\u0101girati. Both banks of the river are populated.\n\n\u00b9 Murshid\u0101b\u0101d was the latest Muhammadan Capital of Bengal, its immediate predecessor for over 100 years being Dacca or Jah\u0101ngirnagar, in Eastern Bengal. In 1704 A.C., Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n also known as J\u0101far Kh\u0101n (then the Mughul Diwan) falling out with Prince Az\u012bm-us-sh\u0101h, the Mughul Viceroy or Nawab at Dacca, transferred the seat of government from Dacca to the little town of Makhs\u016bs\u0101b\u0101d, and named the place after himself \"Murshid\u0101b\u0101d.\" After the battle of Plassey in 1757 A.C., Clive on entering Murshid\u0101b\u0101d describes it thus: \"This city is as extensive, populous, and rich as the city of London... The inhabitants, if inclined to destroy the Europeans, might have done so with sticks and stones.\" Even after the battle of Plassey, Murshid\u0101b\u0101d remained for some years the seat of administration. The result of the battle of Plassey was at the time appreciated both by Clive and the people, for the reason that it ended the misrule of Sirajudaula, who had rendered himself obnoxious both to the people and the English by his youthful pranks and vagaries; it was not regarded at the time as interfering with Muslim sovereignty: it merely affected the substitution of a new Nawab (Mir J\u0101far) for Sirajudaula. In 1765, the East India Company received the grant of Diwani or financial administration of Bengal, Behar, and Orissa from the Mughul Emperor of Delhi, Sh\u0101h Al\u0101m, and in the following year Lord Clive, as the Emperor's Diwan, presided in person at the Puniya, or annual collection and settlement of revenues. On this occasion, the young Naw\u0101b Nazim (as administrative and military representative of the Mughul Emperor of Delhi) sat on the maamad, with the Diwan (Lord Clive) on his right hand. The work of administration still remained in the hands of Muhammadan officials. In 1772, Warren Hastings removed the Supreme, Civil, and Criminal Courts from Murshid\u0101b\u0101d to Calcutta, but after three years the Criminal court (Niz\u0101mat Adalat) was re-transferred to Murshid\u0101b\u0101d, and it was only in 1790, under Lord Cornwallis, that the entire revenue, civil, and criminal staff were posted in Calcutta. The Murshid\u0101b\u0101d Mint, the recognized emblem of metropolitan supremacy, was abolished in 1799. Thenceforth, Murshid\u0101b\u0101d has been left only as the residence of the Naw\u0101b, a descendant of Mir J\u0101far, and now it has ceased to be of importance.\nIn the beginning, a merchant named Makhs\u016bs Kh\u0101n built a serai or guest-house there, and called the place Makhs\u016bs\u0101b\u0101d. The houses of a few shop-keepers were placed there. In the reign of Emperor Aurangzib Alamgir, Naw\u0101b J\u0101far Kh\u0101n Nasiri, who held the office of Diw\u0101n of Orissa, received the title of K\u0101rtalab Kh\u0101n and obtained the office of Diw\u0101n of Bengal. After his arrival at Jah\u0101ng\u012brnagar, otherwise called Dh\u0101k\u0101h (Dacca), which at that time was the Viceregal Capital and where from before Prince Azim-u-sh\u0101h, who had been appointed Viceroy by Emperor Aurangzib (as will be set forth hereafter) lived, finding that he (J\u0101far Kh\u0101n) could not pull on with the Prince, put forward the pretext that the mahals of Bengal were at a long distance from that place (Dacca), separated himself from association with the Prince, and established himself at Makhs\u016bs\u0101b\u0101d, and placed there the \u0100ml\u0101s of Zemind\u0101rs, and Q\u0101n\u016bngos and other officials employed in connection with the Revenue Administration of Crown-lands. And at Dughar\u0101h, which was quite a wilderness, he erected a palace, established the Board of Revenue (Dew\u0101nk\u0101h\u0101nah) and the Court of Exchequer, and made collections of the Imperial revenue. And when he was appointed permanently S\u016bbahd\u0101r (Viceroy) of Bengal and Orissa in addition to the office of Diwan, with the title of Murghid Q\u016bli Kh\u0101n and with the gift of a valuable Khil\u2019at, and of the standard and the Naq\u0101rah (a royal drum) and the advancement of Mans\u0101b, on arrival at Makhs\u016bs\u0101b\u0101d, he improved the city, and called it after his own name \u201cMurghid\u0101b\u0101d.\u201d And establishing a mint there, he had the words \u201cstruck at Murghid\u0101b\u0101d\u201d inscribed on the coins. From that time, this city became the Viceregal seat. It is a beautiful city. Its inhabitants, in the society of the S\u016bbahd\u0101rs, being thrown into contact with the people of Delhi, in point of refinement of manners and conversation, resemble the people of Hind\u016bst\u0101n, unlike those of other parts of Bengal. Amongst its buildings, none that was seen was noteworthy, except the Im\u0101mbarah building, which was erected by\n\n1 It may be of interest to note here that the following mint towns existed in Bengal during the earlier Muhammadan kings: (1) Lakhn\u0101ti, (2) Firuz\u0101b\u0101d (Pandu\u0101h), (3) S\u0101tgaon, (4) Shah-i-Nau (not identified), (5) Gh\u012by\u0101sp\u016br, (6) Sunarg\u0101on, (7) Muazzam\u0101b\u0101d (i.e., Sylhet or Mymensingh), (8) Fath\u0101b\u0101d (Faridp\u016br town), (9) Khalifat\u0101b\u0101d (Bagerhat town in Jessore), and (10) Hussainabad (probably close to Gaur) (See Thomas\u2019 \u201cInitial Coinage\u201d and Blochmann\u2019s Contributions).\nNaw\u0101b Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah. Its praise is beyond description; its equal is not to be found in the whole of Hind\u016bst\u0101n. Although at present one-tenth of it does not exist, yet a remnant of it is a fair specimen of the original edifice. These two verses of Maul\u0101na \u2018Urf\u012b Sh\u012br\u0101z\u012b,\u00b9 (May peace of God be on him!) being found to be apposite to the present case, are transcribed below:\u2014\n\nHow much of morning is known to the dwellers at its gate,\nIn that in its neighbourhood, the sunset has no access;\nWonderful is the fairness of the building, that in gazing at it,\nThe glance does not turn back to the socket from the sight of the wall!\n\nAnd the palaces of M\u016bt\u012bjhil\u00b2 and Hir\u0101jihl, which were most beautiful, at present have been dug up from their foundations, and are in complete ruin.\n\n---\n\nPORTS OF HUGHILI AND SATGAON.\n\nThe Ports of Hughili and Satgaon\u00b3 are at a distance of half a karoh from each other. In former times, Satgaon was a large city, thickly populated, and was the seat of a Governor. And the factories of the Christian Portuguese, and of other traders were also there. When Satgaon fell into ruin owing to its river silt ing up, the port of Hughili became populous. The Faujd\u0101rs of\n\n\u00b9 Urf\u012b was a famous Persian poet of Shir\u0101z, attached to the Court of Emperor Jahangir. He possessed poetical genius of a high order, and was much appreciated by the Emperor. I published an English translation of some of his \u201cOdes\u201d or \u201cQasaid,\u201d many years ago.\n\n\u00b2 The palace of Mut\u012bjhil was for several years, after the installation of Naw\u0101b Mir J\u0101far, the residence of the British Political Resident attached to the Court of the Naw\u0101b Nazims of Bengal.\n\n\u00b3 Satgaon, the ancient royal port or \u201cGanges Regia\u201d of Bengal. It lay at the point of junction of the Hughili and the holy Sarasw\u0101ti. The river Sarasw\u0101ti silted up during the first-half of the sixteenth century, and the Portuguese merchants found that the harbour of Satgaon was no longer practicable, and accordingly fixed their port at Gholaghat in 1587, a few miles lower down on the same east bank of the river. Gholaghat soon became the chief emporium, and took the name of the river, that is, Hughili town or port. Satgaon is now become a petty village, though when I visited it from Hughili in 1888, I found traces of a ruined mosque. The first mention of Satgaon that I find in Muhammadan history is in the reign of Sultan Ghiasuddin Tugh-luk Shah who invaded Bengal to chastise Bahadur Shah, King of Sunargaon. (See pp 45-46 Tarikh-i-Firuzshahi).\nthis port had always been appointed directly by the Emperors of Delhi, and had little concern with the Na\u1e63ims or Viceroys of Bengal. Naw\u0101b J\u0101far Kh\u0101n brought the office of Faujd\u0101r of this port within his jurisdiction, as an appendage to the Ni\u1e93\u0101mat and Diw\u0101ni of Bengal, as will be mentioned hereafter, if God pleases. And in that the abovementioned Naw\u0101b placed the centre of the financial resources of the country of Bengal upon the customs-duties levied from traders, he maintained peaceful and liberal relations with the merchants of England, China, Persia, and Tur\u0101n, and beyond the legitimate imports he did not levy one dam oppressively or against the established usage. Hence the port of H\u016bghli, in his time, became more populous than before. And merchants of all the ports of Arabia and Ajam,\u00b9 and English Christians who were ship-owners and wealthy Mughuls made their quarters there; but the credit of the Mughul merchants was greater than that of merchants belonging to other classes. The English were absolutely prohibited from erecting towers and building baz\u0101rs and forts and moats. After this, when oppression and extortion of the Faujd\u0101rs increased, the port of H\u016bghli declined, and Calcutta owing to the liberality and protection afforded by the English, and the lightness of the duties levied there, became populous.\n\n---\n\nTHE CITY OF CALCUTTA.\n\nThe City of Calcutta\u00b2 in past times was a village in a t\u0101luq\u0101h endowed in favour of K\u0101li, which is the name of an idol which is there. Inasmuch as in the language of Bengal, \u2018Karta\u2019 and\n\n\u00b9 Ajam. The Arabs divided the races of the world into the Arabs and the Ajamis or non-Arabs. Persia Proper was called Irak-i-Ajam.\n\n\u00b2 In 1596 A.C., it is mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbari as a rent-paying village named \u201cKalikatta\u201d under Sark\u0101r S\u0101tgaon. (See Ain, p. 141, Vol. 2, Jar. Tr.) In 1686, in consequence of a rupture with the Musulm\u0101n authorities at H\u016bghli port, the English merchants, led by their Chief, Job Charnock, were obliged to quit their factory there and to retreat to S\u016btan\u0101ti (now a northern quarter of Calcutta). Their new settlement soon extended itself southwards first over the village of \u201cKalikatta\u201d (between the present Customs-House and the Mint) and subsequently over the village of Gobindp\u016br (which existed to the south of the present site of Fort William). In 1689, it became the headquarters of the servants of the East India Company employed in Bengal factories. In 1698, the original Fort William was built, being replaced by a\nKata\" means \"master\" or \"lord,\" therefore this village was named K\u0101likat\u0101, meaning that its owner was K\u0101li. Gradually, by a process of the modulation of the tongue, the alif and the ea being dropped it was called Kalkata. The following is the account of the foundation of this city and the establishment of the English factory there. In the period of the Nizamat of Naw\u0101b J\u0101far Kh\u0101n, the factory of the English Company, which existed in the port of H\u016bghl\u012b, close to Lakhoghat and Mughulp\u016brah, suddenly after sunset when the English Chiefs were at dinner commenced crumbling down; the English Chiefs harum-scarum ran out, and saved themselves from this whirlpool of destruction. But all their chattels and properties were washed away by the tide. Many cattle and some human beings also perished. Mr. Charnock, the English Chief, purchasing the garden of Benares, the Company's Gu-masht\u0101, which was situated in Lakhoghat, adjoining to the town, cut down its trees, and laid the foundation of a factory, and commenced erecting two-storeyed and three-storeyed buildings. When the boundary walls were completed and they were about to roof them with the main beams, the nobility and the gentry of the Sayyid and Mughul tribes, who consisted of rich merchants, represented to Mir N\u0101sir, Faujd\u0101r of H\u016bghl\u012b, that when the strangers would get upon the terraces of their high buildings, it would interfere with the sanctity and privacy of their ladies and families. The Faujd\u0101r communicated the gist of this state of things to Naw\u0101b J\u0101far Kh\u0101n, and subsequently deputed there all the Mughals and the whole of the nobility and the gentry. These, in the presence of the Naw\u0101b, set forth their grievances. Naw\u0101b J\u0101far Kh\u0101n despatched an order to the Fanjd\u0101r prohibiting absolutely the English from placing a brick over a brick and from laying a timber over a timber. The Faujd\u0101r, directly on the receipt of the order of prohibition, directed that none of the masons and new one in 1742, the above three villages being purchased in 1700 from Prince Asam, son of Emperor Aurangzeb. In 1756, the town was sacked and Fort William captured by Naw\u0101b Sirajun-d-daulah, who changed its name to Alinagar. In January 1757 it was re-taken by the English under Admirals Watson and Clive. A new fort, the present Fort William, was commenced by Clive, but it was finished in 1773, when the maidan was also opened out. In this connection, it may be added, that the author of the \"Seirul Mutakherin,\" though hostile to Sirajun-d-daulah, and though a contemporary historian, does not say a word about the \"Black Hole\" affair!\ncarpenters should do work in connection with the buildings, and in consequence the buildings remained incomplete. Mr. Charnock, getting enraged, prepared to fight. But as he had a small force and except one ship, no other ships were then there, and besides the authority of Naw\u0101b J\u0101far Kh\u0101n was overpowering, and the Mughals were numerous, and the powerful Faujd\u0101r was on their side, seeing no good in shaking hands and feet, of necessity, raised the anchor of the ship. And directing from the top of the deck of the ship a lense-burner towards the populous part of the town alongside the bank of the river including Chandanagore, he set it on fire and started. The Faujd\u0101r, in order to enquire into this matter, wrote to the officer in charge of the garrison of Makhwa to the effect that the ship should not be allowed to pass on. The above officer placed across the river an iron chain, every link whereof was ten seers in weight, and which had been kept ready alongside the wall of the fort for the purpose of blocking the passage of the boats of the Arracanese and Magh enemies, by being drawn from one bank of the river to the other. The ship on arriving at the chain got blocked, and could not move down further. Mr. Charnock cut up the chain with an English sword and effected his passage through, and sailed down with the ship to the sea, and started for the country of the Dakhin. In that, the Emperor Aurangzeb at that time was in the Dakhin, and the Mahratta free-booters had cut off supplies of food-grains from all sides, a great famine occurred amongst the Imperial troops. The Chief of the (English) factory in the Karnatik supplied the Imperial army with food-stuffs, carrying the same on board the ships, and thus rendered loyal and good service. The Emperor Aurangzeb being pleased with the English, enquired as to what the English Company prayed for. The English Chief petitioned for the grant of a Sanad (Royal patent), permitting the erection of factories in the Imperial dominions, and especially the erection of the Bengal factory. The petition was granted by the Emperor, and an Imperial Farman (patent) was issued, remitting all customs on ships of the English Company, and directing the levy from them of Rs. 3,000, by way of tribute to the Royal Customs-house, and permitting the erection of a factory. Mr. Charnock, with the Imperial Farman and orders, returned from the Dakhin to Bengal, and at a place called Ch\u0101nak (Barrackp\u016br)\nlanded. He sent agents with presents, tribute, and gifts, &c., to Naw\u0101b J\u0101far Kh\u0101n, and obtained permission to build a factory at Calcutta, in accordance with the Imperial Sanad, and building a new factory there, devoted himself to the improvement of the town, and opened trading transactions with Bengal. To this day the factory is notable.\n\nCalcutta is a large city on the banks of the river Bh\u0101girati. It is a large port, and the commercial emporium of the English Company, and is subject to them. Small ships, called sloops, always every year come to that port from China, England, and other parts, and many remain there. At present, this city is the place of residence of the English Chiefs and officers and employ\u00e9s. The buildings are solidly made of lime and brick. As its soil is damp and salt, from proximity to the sea, the buildings of that city are two-storeyed and three-storeyed. The lower rooms are unfit for dwelling. The buildings are constructed after those of England; they are well-ventilated, commodious, and lofty. The roads of that city are broad and paved with pounded brick. And besides the English Chiefs, the Beng\u0101lis, the Armenians, &c., there are also rich merchants. The water of wells in this city, owing to salt, is unfit for drinking, and if anyone drinks it, he suffers much In summer and rainy seasons, the water of the river also become bitter and salt; but the water of tanks, which are plenty, is drunk. The sea is forty Karoh distant from this place; within every day and night the water of the river has one flow and one ebb. At times of full moon, for three days, the tide comes furiously once in course of a day and night. It shows a wonderful condition and a strange furiousness. It drives across the banks many boats, and wrecks them, but those which are not on the sides of the rivers are left undamaged. Consequently, on that day, at that place boats, both small and large, are left without anchor. This tide in the language of Bengal is called b\u0101n, and the tide which occurs daily is called jo\u0101r. An earthen fort has been erected to the south, outside the city. The English are wonderful in ventors. To relate its praise is difficult; one ought to see it, to appreciate it. Viewed externally from any of the four sides, the quadrangular rampart looks low like the slopes of tanks; but viewed internally, it looks lofty. Inside the fort, there are large and lofty buildings. Wonderful workmanship has been displayed in the construction of the fort; and other curious and rare workmanships are visible in\nthis city. In point of beauty of its edifices and the novelty of its arts, no city is equal to it, barring Delhi, which is unique. But its drawback is that its air is putrid, its water salt, and its soil so damp that the ground, though protected by roof, and cemented with brick and lime, is damp owing to excessive moisture, and the doors and walls, to the height of two or three cubits, are also wet and damp. For four months of winter, the climate is not very unhealthy, but during eight months of summer and rainy seasons, it is very unhealthy. At the present day, when since a few years the countries of Bengal, Behar, and Orissa have passed into the possession of the Chiefs of the English Company, this city has become the seat of Government of these dominions. The head of these Chiefs, who is styled Governor-General, resides in this city, and his deputies are appointed and sent out to each district, and remit to Calcutta the revenue-collections from each district.\u00b9 The officers of the Board of Revenue are in Calcutta.\n\nWonderful is the City of Calcutta in Bengal;\nFor it is a model of China and England.\nIts buildings please the heart and the soul,\nAnd tower to the height of the air.\nA master-hand has wrought such workmanship in it,\nThat everything is apaint and everything beautiful.\nFrom the exquisite workmanship of the English,\nReason, in contemplating it, becomes confounded.\n\n\u00b9 Until 1707, when Calcutta was first declared a Presidency, it had been dependent on the older English settlement at Madras. From 1707 to 1773 it was on an equal footing with presidencies at Madras and Bombay. In 1773, an Act of Parliament was passed, under which it was declared that the Presidency of Calcutta should exercise a sort of general control over other possessions of the English East India Company, that the Chief of the Presidency of Calcutta should be called Governor-General. In 1772, Warren Hastings had given into the hands of the servants of the East India Company the general administration of Bengal which had hitherto been in the hands of Muhammadan Nizamat officials, and had removed the Treasury from Murshidabad to Calcutta. The latter town thus became both the capital of Bengal and the seat of Supreme Government. In 1834, the Governor-General of Bengal was created Governor-General of India, and was allowed to appoint a Deputy-Governor of Bengal to manage the affairs of Bengal in his absence. In 1854, a separate Lieutenant-Governor was appointed for Bengal, Behar, and Orissa.\n\n(See Wilson's Early Annals of the \"English in Bengal,\" Buckland's \"Bengal under Lieutenant-Governors.\")\nThe hat-wearing English dwell in it,\nThey are all truthful and well-behaved.\nThe dwellings are like these, the dwellers are like those,\nHow far can I detail their praises?\nIts streets are clean and paved,\nThe air every morning passes through and sweeps them.\nIn every alley moonlike faces move about,\nRobed in pretty and clean dresses.\nTheir faces are bright with radiance, like the moon,\nYou might say the moon has become the earth-trotter.\nOne is like the moon, another is like Jupiter,\nAnother is like Venus in effulgence.\nWhen large numbers, like wandering stars, stroll about,\nThe alleys resemble the milky-way.\nYou see, if you go to bazar,\nThe rare goods of the world there.\nAll the articles that exist in four quarters of the globe,\nYou find in its bazar, without search.\nIf I were to depict the people of art therein,\nThe pen would fail to portray such a picture.\nBut it is well known to all,\n\nEngland.\n\nThat pre-eminence in workmanship pertains to China and\nIts plain is level like the surface of the sky,\nRoads are fixed on it, like the equator.\nPeople, whilst promenading in gardens,\nLike wandering stars, meet each other in their walks.\nSuch a city in the country of the Bengalis,\nNo one had seen, no one had heard of.\n\nChandannagar\u00b9 (Chandarnagar) alias Far\u0101shdangah, is twelve\nkroh distant from Calcutta. The factory of the Christian French\nis situated there. It is a small town on the bank of the river\nBhagirati. There is a French Chief there. He is the administra-\ntor of the affairs and mercantile concerns of that town. The\nEnglish Chiefs have no authority there. Similarly at Ch\u016bchar\u0101h\n(Chinsur\u0101h\u00b2), the Dutch hold authority.\n\n\u00b9 Chandanagore, founded as a small French settlement in 1678, rose to\nmercantile importance under Dupleix in the middle of the eighteenth century.\n\u00b2 In the seventeenth century, the Dutch merchants who had hitherto resided\nat S\u0101tgaon and H\u016bghli ports, founded their factory and port at Chin-\nsur\u0101h, a little below H\u016bghli town.\nChuchar\u0101h, or Chinsur\u0101h, which adjoins the port of Hughli, is to the south of that port, and is one karoh to the north of Chandarnagar. And similarly Chiramp\u016br (Sirampur) is on the banks of the same river, opposite to Ch\u0101nak (Barackpur). The factory of the Danes is there, and it is also called Dinam\u0101rnagar. In these places, besides the owners of the factories, no one else has authority.\n\nTOWN OF PURNIAH.\n\nIn former times it was called Pargana-i-havili. Rupees 32,000 were its revenue collections. Since the R\u0101jah of Birnagar also had a force of 15,000 cavalry and infantry, and other inhabitants of that part of the Chakw\u0101r tribe, &c., were refractory and of plundering propensity, and used to annoy much the travellers, therefore on the limits of the M\u016brang, the fort of Jal\u0101lgadah, to a distance of two karohs from Purniah, was erected, and a commandant, in charge of the fort, was posted there. In compliance with the petition of Naw\u0101b Saif Kh\u0101n, grandson of Amir Kh\u0101n the elder, who enjoyed the name and title of his father, and was descended from Syeds and illustrious Omra, and had royal connections, Naw\u0101b J\u0101far Kh\u0101n applied to Emperor Aurangzeb for the former's deputation, and accordingly Saif Kh\u0101n was deputed for the purpose of chastising the R\u0101jah of Birnagar and other mal-\n\n---\n\n1 The Danes in the seventeenth century founded their factory and port at Serampur, about eight miles south of Chandanagore.\n2 In the thirteenth century, Purniah fell into the hands of the Muhammadans. Sarkar of Purniah is described in the \u0100in-i-Akbar\u012b, as containing nine mahals, with revenue 6,408,775 dams (See Jarrett's Trans. of \u0100in, Vol. 2, p. 134). Under its administrator, Nawab Saif Khan, a contemporary of Nawab J\u0101far Kh\u0101n, the Viceroy of Bengal, it attained the height of its prosperity. Its manufacture in bider works, once so famous, was found by me to have nearly died out when I was at Purniah in 1898.\n3 The tract of country between the northern limits of Purniah district and the foot of Nepal Proper is locally known as the M\u016brang.\n4 Ruins of the fort still stand. It is now in the zemindary of Mr. Forbes of Purniah, a few miles to the north of Purniah railway station.\n5 The Maasir-ul-Umaru (Vol. 1, Fasc. III, pp. 677-687) gives a detailed biographical sketch of Amir Kh\u0101n. It mentions Saif Kh\u0101n, Faizdar of Purniah, as one of the sons of Amir Kh\u0101n. The Maasir calls Amir Kh\u0101n, \"Amir Kh\u0101n Mir-i-Miran.\" Amir Kh\u0101n's mother, Hamida Banu Begum, was a grand-daughter of Eminn-d-daulah Aqaf Kh\u0101n.\n6 Birnagar is now a circle under the Sub-Manager of the Durbhang\u0101 Raj.\ncontents of that part of the country. Naw\u0101b J\u0101far Kh\u0101n, considering the arrival of such a person to be an acquisition, conferred the office of Faujd\u0101r of Zila' Purniah and that of Commandant of Jal\u0101lgad\u0101h upon him, and also settled on him the Pargana of Birnagar alias Dharmp\u016br,\u00b9 and G\u00fcndw\u0101rah, which is in the province of Behar, pertaining to Purniah, and also the mahals of the J\u0101g\u012br forming an appendage to the office of Commandant of the above Fort. The aforesaid Kh\u0101n, being appointed independent ruler of the district, after much fighting expelled D\u016brjan Singh,\u00b2 son of Bir Sh\u0101h, the R\u0101jah of Birnagar, who was disloyal and refractory, and brought the aforesaid pargana under his subjection, and having thoroughly chastised the other malcontents freed the roads from all perils. He represented the state of affairs to the Emperor, and submitted that the mahals were small, and that his stay in this mahal was unprofitable. In consequence, the Emperor Aurangzeb wrote to J\u0101far Kh\u0101n as follows: \"I have sent to you a lion, putting him in a cage. If he does not get his food, he is certain to give you trouble.\" The aforesaid Naw\u0101b, who regarded the stay of such a person to be a boon, remitted all the outstanding revenue due from him, and made concession in view of the suitable maintenance of his rank and station. The above Kh\u0101n, following the example of J\u0101far Kh\u0101n, imprisoned all the zemindars of that district, and did not omit any means of realising the revenue. So that realising eighteen l\u0101kh of rupees from those mahals, he appropriated them to his own use, and day by day the strength of his government and finances and of his army increased. And making peace with the zemindars of the M\u016brang, he commenced to cut jungles and to bring them under cultivation. Bringing under cultivation half the wastes up to the foot of the mountains of the M\u016brang, and placing it under his rule, he enlarged his country and his resources. And J\u0101far Kh\u0101n, seeing and hearing of it, used to connive. At present, Purniah\u00b3 is a large city, and the rivers K\u016bsi and S\u016bnra pass through it. Its soil is low and full of water. In the rainy season the floods rush down from the moun-\n\n\u00b9 At present each of these forms a police circle.\n\u00b2 Several Durjan Singhs are mentioned in the Alamgirnamah. One Bir Singh, Zemindar of Srinagar, is also mentioned in it.\n\u00b3 It did not appear to me so when I was at Purniah in 1898. The old town or city appeared to me to have got into complete ruin, and very little trace of its former opulence and prosperity existed.\ntains of the M\u00fbrang, and the fields and wastes are inundated. Much of the cultivation is consigned to destruction by the floods. Paddy, wheat, pulse and mustard-seed and other food-grains and all kinds of corn grow in abundance. And oil and turmeric and saltpetre, both of water and fire, and pepper, and large cardamom and cassia-leaf and very large trees of ebony, are produced well there. And the flowers of jasmine and bela and the red-rose and other flowers that grow there possess exquisite scents. The mountains of the M\u00fbrang are six days' journey to the north of Purniah. The M\u00fbrngi wood, which is called Bahad\u00fbri, is obtained from those mountains. From the top of the mountains, the road towards Nep\u00e2l and Kashmir is very close, but it is very undulating. Half the mahals of Purniah pertain to the annexes of the province of Beh\u00e2r; but Purniah itself is within Bengal. It is a cold country and the climate of that tract is insalubrious and incongenial. Tumours of the throat in men and women generally, as well as in wild beasts and birds, are common in that country. Masonry buildings are few, excepting the Fort,\u00b9 the L\u00e2l B\u00e2gh,\u00b2 and some others. Formerly, Sarn\u00e2h was more populous than Purniah. And Gand\u00e2h-golah (Caragola),\u00b3 on the banks of the Ganges, was the resort of traders and mahajans from various places. Owing to cheapness of food-grains and comforts, landholders and travellers and professional men came from every part, and dwelt there. And very often boundary-disputes led to fightings with the R\u00e2jah of the M\u00fbrang. Saif Kh\u00e2n, every year, used to go to Murshid\u00e2b\u00e2d for visiting Naw\u00e2b J\u00e2far Kh\u00e2n. The above Naw\u00e2b used to treat him like a brother. Whenever a disturbance occurred in that district, the aforesaid Naw\u00e2b used to send troops for assistance. From Gand\u00e2h golah (Caragola) and the banks of the Ganges to the M\u00fbrang, the tract of Purniah is about ten days' journey in extent. And from the mountains of the M\u00fbrang, a route \u2074 leads to Kuch-Beh\u00e2r and Assam. And the tribute of the R\u00e2jah of the M\u00fbrang was paid in game.\n\n\u00b9 and \u00b2 No traces of these could be found by me, when I was at Purniah in 1898.\n\u00b3 A fair is still held annually at Caragola, and is largely attended by Nepalese, Bhutias and other hill-tribes, though not to the same extent as before.\n\u2074 Three routes to Kuch Behar and Assam are described in the Alamgir-namah (p. 683).\nDHAKAH (OR DACCA) alias JAHANGIRNAGAR.\n\nThis city is on the banks of the Budhigang\u0101, and the Ganges, named Padm\u0101, flows three karoh or kos distant from this city. In past times it was known by this name. During the sovereignty of Nur-ad-din Muhammad Jah\u0101ngir, the Emperor, the city was called Jah\u0101ngirnagar. From that time till about the end of the reign of Emperor Aurangzeb, this city was the\n\n1 Dacca or Jah\u0101ngirnagar was the Musalm\u0101n Viceregal Capital of Bengal during Mughul rule in India for a century, before it was shifted to Murshidabad by Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n in 1704 A.C. In 1610 A.C., Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n, the Mughul Viceroy of Bengal, shifted the Viceregal Capital from Rajmahal, or Akbarnagar, to Dacca. This transfer of capital appears to have been decided upon, because the Musalm\u0101n dominions in Bengal had considerably extended eastward, and Rajmahal ceased to occupy a central position, and also because Magh and Arracanese incursions from Arrakan had become frequent. To effectually guard against the latter, a powerful fleet was constructed and maintained at Dacca and on the rivers Padda and Megna; and colonies of Musalm\u0101n feudal barons (most of whom have now died out or sunk into ploughmen) were planted throughout Eastern Bengal, especially at places of strategic importance, in order to hold in check all disloyal Afghan elements, and to prevent their intriguing with the Magh raiders. Except for about sixteen years, when Prince Shah Shuj\u0101 re-transferred the Viceregal Capital to Rajmahal, Dacca remained the Viceregal Capital of Bengal throughout the seventeenth century under three illustrious Mughul Emperors, viz., Jah\u0101ngir, Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, and Aurangzeb. The most notable amongst the Mughul Viceroys of Dacca were Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n, Mir Jumla, the General of Aurangzeb, and Sh\u0101sata Kh\u0101n (nephew of Empress N\u016br Jahan). The latter two Naw\u0101bs are still remembered for their encouragement of architecture, and for their construction of great public works conducive to the material improvement of the people. Whilst the great achievement of the first was the breaking of the last neck of Afghan opposition. The suburb of Dacca, it is related, extended northwards for a distance of 15 miles, now covered with dense jungles. The muslin manufacture of Dacca, once so famous, has now nearly died out. The old fort, erected in the reign of Emperor Jah\u0101ngir, has disappeared. The only old public buildings now remaining are the Katra, built by Sh\u0101h Shuj\u0101 in 1645, and the palace of Lal B\u0101gh, both of these also being in ruins. (See Taylor's Topography of Dacca and Dr. Wise's History of Dacca).\n\nDacca, or Dhakka, occurs in the Akbarn\u0101m\u0101h as an Imperial Thana in 1584 the mahal to which it belonged is named \"Dhakka Baz\u016b;\" it pertained in those early days to Sarkar Baz\u016bha. (See Ain-i-Akbari Jarrett's Trans., Vol. 2, Fasc. II, p. 138). Dacca, though it has lost its former Viceregal magnificence and opulence, has not yet sunk into an ordinary Bengal town, by reason of its being the residence of the present liberal and public-spirited 'Naw\u0101bs of Dacca,'\nViceregal Capital of Bengal. Since the period of his Niz\u0101mat, when Naw\u0101b J\u0101far Kh\u0101n made Murshidabad the seat of government, the latter became the Viceregal seat. At present on behalf of the Chiefs of the English Company, there is a district officer at Jah\u0101ng\u012brnagar. White muslin is excellently manufactured there.\n\n---\n\nSARK\u0100R SUNARGAON.\n\nSark\u0101r Sunargaon is to a distance of six karoh to the south-east of Jah\u0101ng\u012brnagar. A species of very fine muslin is manufactured there. And in the Mouz\u0101 of Kathral Sundar there is a reservoir of water; whatever clothes are washed there are turned into white linen.\n\n---\n\n1 Sunargaon City, close to Dacca to the south-east, was long an ancient Musalm\u0101n Capital of Bengal. To this place in 1281 A.C. (see p. 87 Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi by Barni) Emperor Balban from Delhi came, and pursued Tughral, who had proclaimed himself Sult\u0101n Mughisuddin in 1279 A.C.; and about 610 A.H. (1214 A.C.) it was together with Bang (East Bengal) subdued (Tabaqat-i-Nasiri, Pers.: text, p. 163) by Sult\u0101n Ghiasuddin, one of the immediate successors of Bakhtiar Khilji. Sunargaon is a place of melancholy historical interest, for it was here that the line of Balbani kings of Bengal (1282 to 1331 A.C.) ended, and it was also here that the last Balbani sovereign of Bengal, Bahadur Sh\u0101h, in 1331 A.C., under the order of Emperor Muhammad Sh\u0101h Tughlak, was captured, put to death, and his skin stuffed and paraded throughout the Emperor\u2019s dominions. Subsequently, in 1388 A.C., the first Independent Mussalm\u0101n king of Bengal, named Fakhruddin Ab\u016bl Muzaffar Mubarak Sh\u0101h, proclaimed his independence at Sunargaon, where he resided and minted coins Thomas\u2019 \u201cInitial Coinage\u201d and Tarikh-i-Firuz-Shahi, p. 480). Mubarak Sh\u0101h\u2019s son, Ghazi Sh\u0101h (third Independent king), also resided at Sunargaon, and minted coins there. In 1352 A.C., Haji Ilyas or Sult\u0101n Shamsuddin Abul Muzaffar Ilyas Sh\u0101h (fourth Independent king) established himself at Sunargaon (Thomas\u2019 \u201cInitial Coinage\u201d) and there founded a new dynasty of Independent Bengal kings, who (with an interruption only of about forty years) continued to rule over Bengal for over a century (1352 to 1495 A.C.), and divided their residence between Gaur and Sunargaon. It was to Sunargaon that the illustrious poet of Shiraz, Hafiz, sent his famous ghazl to Sult\u0101n Ghiasuddin (son of Sikandar Sh\u0101h and grandson of Ilyas Sh\u0101h), when the latter invited the poet to his Royal Court at Sunargaon. Sunargaon has now become an insignificant village, without a single trace of its former regal splendour. (See also Dr. Wise\u2019s note on Sunargaon, J.A.S., 1874, p. 82).\nISLAMABAD alias CHATGAON.\n\nIslamabad alias Chatgaon (Chittagong), from ancient times, has been a large town, and its environs are forests of trees. It is south-east of Murshidabad on the seacoast, and in ancient times it was a large port. The traders of every country\u2014especially the ships of the Christians\u2014used to frequent it. But at present, since Calcutta is a large port, all other ports of Bengal have fallen into decay. It is said that ships which founder in other parts of the sea re-appear in front of Chittagong; it rests with the narrator to prove this. The ebb and flow of the sea occurs also here. And the fighting-roosts of that tract are well known.\n\nSARKAR BOGLA.\n\nSarkar Bagla was also a fort on the seacoast, and around it was a forest of trees. And the ebb and flow of the sea also occurs there, similarly to what occurs at other places on the seaside and in the environs of Calcutta. In the twenty-ninth year of the accession to the throne of Emperor Akbar, one hour of the day was remaining, when a strange flood occurred, in consequence of which the whole town was submerged. The Rajah of that town, getting on a boat, escaped. For five hours the fury of the storm, and lightning and thunder, and tumult of the sea lasted. Two lakes of human beings and cattle were engulfed in the sea of annihilation.\n\n1 Chittagong was found to be in the hands of King Fakhruddin of Sunargan about 1360 A.D., when Ibn-i-Batutah visited it. It was re-subdued by King Nasrat Shah, son of Hussain Shah, in the beginning of the sixteenth century. In Todar Mal's rent-roll, it is assessed at Rs. 285,607, and the Sarkar is shown as including seven mahals. During the struggle for supremacy in Bengal between Afghans and Mughuls in the seventeenth century, it temporarily slipped out of Moslem hands, and had to be re-conquered in 1684 A.D. by Nawab Shaista Khan, Emperor Aurangzeb's Viceroy at Dacca, who named it Islamabad (See the charming description of the re-conquest of Chittagong, in the Alamgirnamah, pp. 940-956.) Chittagong was, from very early times, an important place of trade, and the early Portuguese traders called it \"Porto Grando.\"\n\n2 Sarkar Bogla or Bakla in Abul Faiz's Ain is stated to have contained four mahals, and its revenue was Rs. 178,756. It comprised portions of the Backergunj and Sundarban districts and the southernmost portions of the Dacca district. The author of the Seiral Mutakherin calls it Sarkar Hugla.\nSARKAR RANGPUR AND GHOORAGHAT.\n\nRangpur and Ghuragh\u00e1t.\u2014Here silk is produced, and Tangan ponies, coming from the mountains of Bhutan, sell. A fruit called Latkan of the size of walnuts, and with the taste of pomegranates, and containing three seeds, grows there.\n\nSARKAR MAHMUDABAD.\n\nSarkar Mahmudabad was a fort, and in its environs were rivers. In the period when Sher Shah conquered Bengal, a num-\n\n1 Sarkar Ghoragh\u00e1t comprised portions of Dinajpur, Rangpur, and Bogra districts. Being the northern frontier district skirting Koch-Behar, numerous colonies of Afghan and Mughal chiefs were planted there under the feudal system, with large jagir lands under each. Many of the mahals bear purely Muhammadan names, such as Basu Zafar Shahi, Basu Faulad Shahi, Nasratabad, Bayizidpur, Taluk Husain, Taluk Ahmad Khan, Kabul, Masjid Husain Shahi. The Sarkar produced much raw silk. Eighty-four mahals; revenue, Rs. 202,077. The old Musalm\u0101n military outpost of Deocote near Gangarampur was in this Sarkar. It was established in the time of Bakhshiar Khilji (see Blochmann's Contr., J.A.S., 1873, p. 215, Tabaqat-i-Nasiri, p. 156, Ain-i-Akbari, Vol. II, p. 135 and Vol. I, p. 370). After the battle of Patna, 982 A.H., when Daud retired to Orissa, (Badaoni, p. 184, Vol. II), his generals Kalapahar and Babu Manaki proceeded to Ghoraghat, (Badaoni, p. 192). Akbar's general, Majum Khan, died at Ghoraghat.\n\n2 Sarkar Mahmudabad, named after one of the Sultans Mahmud Sh\u0101hs of Bengal, comprised north-eastern Nadiya, north-eastern Jessore, and western Faridpur. Eighty-eight mahals; revenue Rs. 290,256. Its principal mahals were Santor, Naldi, Mahmudshahi, and Nasratshahi. When Akbar's army in 1574 under Munim Khan-i-Khanan invaded Bengal, Murad Khan, another Imperialist-General, invaded South-Eastern Bengal. He conquered, says the Akharnamah, Sarkars Bakla and Fathabad (Faridpur) and settled and died there. It is remarkable that close to Faridpur there is a village (now a railway station) called Khan-Khananpur, which probably was the residence of Murad Khan, and which again is close to a place called Rajbari (probably the seat of the old Rajahs). His sons were treacherously murdered at a feast to which they were invited by Mukund, the Rajah of Bhusna and Fatahabad. (See Ain-i-Akbari, p. 374, Bloch. Trans.) During the reigns of Jahangir and Shah Jah\u0101n, Sutranjit, son of Mukund, gave trouble, and at length in Shah Jah\u0101n's reign was captured and executed at Dhaka (1636 A.C.) Nawab Jafar Khan about 1772 broke up this Sarkar, and annexed part of it to Rajshahi and part to the new Chaklah of Bhusna. Bhusna lies near Bonmalidih and Dakhinbari, ancient Moslem colonies, and it is curious that west of it, on the Nabaganga, we find Satrajipur close to an ancient Moslem colony, at Alukdih; whilst opposite to Faridpur we find Mukund-chor, which is again close to \"Khan-\nber of elephants belonging to the R\u0101jah of that place escaped into the jungles; ever since which elephants are to be obtained in those jungles. And pepper also grows in those parts.\n\n---\n\n**SARK\u0100R B\u0100RB\u0100K\u0100B\u0100D.**\n\nB\u0101rbak\u0101b\u0101d.

It extended from Sarkar Lakhnauti, or Gaur, along the Padda to Bag\u016bra, and comprised portions of Maldah, Dinajpur, Rajshahi, and Bogra. Its clothes were well known, especially the stuffs called kh\u0101nah. Thirty-eight mahals; revenue Rs. 436,288. (See \u0100in-i-Akbar\u012b, Vol. II, p. 137, and Blochmann\u2019s Contr., J.A.S., 1873, p. 215.)\n\n2 Sark\u0101r Baz\u016bh\u0101 extended from the limits of Sarkar Barbak\u0101b\u0101d, and included portions of Rajshahi, Bogra, Pabna, and Maimansingh, and reached in the south a little beyond the town of Dacca. Thirty-two mahals; revenue Rs. 987,921. (See \u0100in, Vol. II, p. 187).\n\n3 Sark\u0101r Silhat adjoining to Sark\u0101r Baz\u016bh\u0101, chiefly extended east of the Surma river. The country was conquered by Musalmans led by a warrior-saint called Sh\u0101h Jal\u0101l in the end of the fourteenth century, when the Afghan King Shamsuddin ruled over Bengal with his capital at Gaur. Sh\u0101h Jal\u0101l\u2019s shrine in Silhat town still exists. Silhat supplied India with eunuchs, and Jahangir issued an edict forbidding people of Silhat from castrating boys. Eight mahals; revenue Rs. 167,032 (\u0100in, Vol. II, p. 189, Blochmann\u2019s Contr., J.A.S., 1873, pp. 216, 235, 278).\nout the empire of Hindustan. And delicious fruits\u2014such as oranges, &c., are obtained. And the China-root is also procured from that tract, and the aloes-wood abounds in its mountains. It is said that in the last month of the rainy season, the 'ud tree is felled and is left in water and exposed to the air, then whatever shoots forth is utilised, and what decays is thrown away. A kind of small bird called Banraj, which is black in colour, and has red eyes and long tail, and parti-coloured, pretty, and long wings, is easily snared and tamed there. It catches the note of every animal that it hears. Similarly, Shirganj is the name of another bird; it is not different from Banraj in any way, except in this that the legs and the beak of Shirganj are red. Both these are flesh-eaters, and prey on small birds like sparrows, &c.\n\n---\n\nSARKAR SHARIFABAD.\u00b9\n\nLarge cows, able to carry heavy loads, and large goats, and large fighting-cocks are bred there.\n\n---\n\nSARKAR MADARAN.\u00b2\n\nSarkar Madaran, is on the southern limit of the kingdom of Bengal.

Formerly it was a large and populous city.\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Sarkar Sharifabad comprised south-eastern portions of Birbhum and a large portion of Burdwan, including Burdwan town. Twenty-six mahals; revenue Rs. 562,218.

Sixteen mahals; revenue Rs. 235,085 (See Ain, Vol. II, p. 141).\n\n\u00b3 Sher Shah had already made plans to shift the seat of Government of Bengal from Tandah to Agmahal, but this was carried out by Raja Man Singh, Akbar's Governor of Bengal, who named the place Rajmahal, and subsequently Akbar nagar, after Emperor Akbar. Before Man Singh, Daud, the last Afghan King of Bengal, had fortified Agmahal (984 A.H.) in his\nrank, on behalf of the N\u0101zim of Bengal, resided there. At present it is in complete dilapidation and ruin.\n\nM\u0100LDAH.\n\nThe town of M\u0101ldah\u00b9 is on the banks of the river Mah\u0101nauda. At a distance of three karoh towards the north, is situate holy Panduah,\u00b2 which contains the sacred shrine of Hazrat Makhd\u016bm Sh\u0101h Jal\u0101l Tabrizi\u00b3 (May God sanctify his shrine!) and the last stand against Mughuls under Kh\u0101n Jahan, Akbar's general (Badaoni, Vol. II, p. 229). Subsequently, in the time of Jahangir, Rajmahal was the scene of a sanguinary battle between Prince Shah Jahan and Jahangir's Viceroy of Bengal, Ibrahim Kh\u0101n Fateh Jang, who was killed (Iqbalnamah-i-Jahangiri, p. 221). It was for about twenty years the Viceregal Capital of Bengal, under Prince Sh\u0101h Shuja, who adorned the city with beautiful marble-palaces, no trace of which, however, now exists.\u2014(See Ain-i-Akbari, Vol. II, p. 340).\n\n\u00b9 As early as 1686 A.C., the English East India Company, with permission of Emperor Aurangzeb, established a silk factory here, and in 1770 A.C., English bazar, close to M\u0101ldah, was fixed upon as the Commercial residency. M\u0101ldah is mentioned in the Tuzuk-i-Jahangiri: \"When I (Jahangir) was prince, I had made a promise to Mir Ziyaudin of Taswin, a Saifi Syed, who has since received the title of Mustafa Khan, to give him and his children Pargana M\u0101ldah, a well-known Pargana in Bengal. This promise was now performed (1617 A.C.)\"\u2014See J.A.S., 1878, p. 215n.\n\n\u00b2 Panduah, like Gaur, is situate in the district of M\u0101ldah. 'Ali Mubarak had his capital at Panduah, and the third independent Musalman Afghan King of Bengal, named Shamsuddin Ilyas Sh\u0101h, fortified the place, and permanently removed the headquarters there about 1353 A.C. Panduah for over 50 years remained the Capital of Bengal, during the reigns of seven Afghan independent Kings of Bengal, after which the capital was in 1446 A.C. during the reign of Nasiruddin Mahmud Sh\u0101h re-transferred to Gaur, which was retained by Muhammadians for about three centuries as their capital. The principal buildings at Panduah are the mausoleums of Makhd\u016bm Sh\u0101h Jal\u0101l and his grandson Qutb Sh\u0101h, the Golden Mosque (1585 A.C.) with wall of granite, and ten domes of brick, the Eklakhi Mosque containing the grave of Ghiasuddin II, the fifth Musalman independent King of Bengal, the Adina Mosque (fourteenth century) characterised by Mr. Fergusson as the most remarkable example of Pathan architecture, and the Satargarh (seventy towered) palace. Panduah was once famous for its manufacture of indigenous paper, but this industry has now died out. Dr. Buchanan Hamilton gives a detailed description of the ruins of Panduah, and the Khurshid Jahannumah (an analysis of which Mr. Beveridge has published) supplements it.\n\n\u00b3 Shaikh Jalaluddin Tabrizi was a disciple of Said Tabrizi, a vicegerent of Shihabuddin Shurawardi, and a friend of Khw\u0101jah Qutbuddin and Shaikh Bahauddin Zakariya. Shaikh Najmuddin, Shaikh-al-Islam at Delhi, bore him\nsacred mausoleum of Hazrat Nur Qutubu-l-'Alam Bangali (May God illuminate his tomb!), which are places of pilgrimage for the people, and resorts of the indigent and the afflicted, and are channels of various boons. For instance, every traveller and beggar who arrives there, and stops therein the night, is not allowed to cook his food for three meals. The servants there supply him from the public store-house, either with cooked food, or with rice, pulse, salt, oil, meat and tobacco, according to his position in life. And every year in the month of Shab-i-barat or Zilhajj, whichever of these months falls in the dry season, a fair attended by a large number of people is held, so much so that laks of people from distances of fifteen and twenty days' journey, such as Hughli, Silhat and Jahangirnagar, &c., come and congregate, and benefit by pilgrimage. And in Maldah and in its environs, good silk-stuff as well as a kind of cotton-stuff of the sort of muslin is manufactured. Plenty of silk-worms are found in its environs, and raw silk is turned out. And for a period of time, the factory of the English Company has been fixed on the other side of the Mahananda. They buy cotton and silk piece-goods, made to order of the chiefs of the English Company, who make advances of money in the shape of bai 'sallam. Raw silk is also manufactured in the factory. And since two or three years, an indigo-factory has been erected, close to the above factory. The Company manufactures and purchases indigo, loads it on ships, and exports it to its own country. Similarly, close to the ruins of Gaur, in the village of Goamalti, another masonry-built factory has been erected; at it also indigo is manufactured. Although a description of the town of Maldah was not necessary, yet as since two years my master, Mr. George Udney (May his fortune always last) has been holding here the office of the Chief of the Factory of the Company, and also since in this place this humble servant has been engaged in the composition and compilation of this book, the above narrative has been given.\n\nenmity; so the saint went to Bengal. His tomb is in the port of Dev Mahal (or Maldivaisle).\u2014See Ain-i-Akbari, Vol. II, p. 366.\n\n1 Shaikh Nur Qutbu-l-'Alam was son and vicegerent of Shaikh Alan-l-Huq (the latter having been vicegerent of Shaikh Akhi Siraj). He was a mystic of eminence, and died in A.H. 808 (A.C. 1405) and was buried at Panduah.\u2014See Ain, Vol. II, p. 371.\n\n2 Note on Sarkars of Bengal (principally compiled from Blochmann's Contribu-\nSECTION IV.\u2014A BRIEF NARRATIVE OF THE RULE OF THE RAJAN (THE HINDU CHIEFS), IN ANCIENT TIMES, IN THE KINGDOM OF BENGAL.\n\nSince by the laudable endeavours of Bang, son of Hind, the dominions of Bengal were populated, his descendants, one after another, continued to extend their sway over the country. The names of these Rajans are recorded in various chronicles, such as Tabaqat-i-Nasiri, Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi, Ain-i-Akbari, Badshahnamah, and Alamgirnamah.\n\nBefore proceeding to the next section, it may be noted here that our author has not described all the Sarkars or old Musalman administrative divisions or districts of Bengal.\n\nBengal before Muhammadan conquest in 1198 A.C. consisted of five Divisions, namely (1) Radha, the tract south of the Ganges and west of the Hughli; (2) Bagdi, the deltaic tract of the Ganges; (3) Banga, the tract to the east and beyond the delta; (4) Barendra, the tracts to the north of the Padma and between the Karatya and Mahananda rivers, and (5) Mithila, the country west of the Mahananda (See Hamilton's \"Hindustan\"). These Divisions appear to have been under different Hindu Rajas or petty chieftains, who had no cohesion amongst them, and were under no allegiance to any central authority, and whose form of government was patriarchal.\n\nWhen Bakhtiar Khilji with eighteen troopers stormed Nadia, then the Hindu capital of Bengal, and conquered Bengal, in 1198 A.C. (594 A.H.), he appears to have conquered Mithila, Barendra, Radha, and the north-western portion of Bagdi. This tract was named Vilayet-i-Lakhnauti after its capital, Lakhnauti city. Its extent is roughly described in 1245 A.C. (641 A.H.) in the Tabaqat-i-Nasiri, p. 162, when its author Minhaj-u-s-Siraj, visited Lakhnauti. Minhaj says that the Vilayet-i-Lakhnauti lies to both sides of the Ganges, and consists of two wings, the eastern one is called Barendra, to which Deokot belongs, and the western called RSI (Radha) to which Lakhnauti belongs, that on one side the town of Lakhnauti is connected with Deokot, and on the other side with Lakhnor by a causeway or embanked road, ten days' distance. Deokot has been identified with an old fort, now known simply as Dandamah, on the left branch of the Purnababa, south of Dinajpur, and close to Gangarampur. Bang or East Bengal appears to have been subdued in 1214 A.C. (610 A.H.) by Sultan Ghasuddin, an immediate successor of Bakhtiar Khilji (Tabaqat, p. 163).\n\nDuring the rule of the Independent Musalman Kings of Bengal (1338 to 1538 A.C.), the extent of the kingdom of Bangala or Bengal was much more apparently than what is described in the Ain-i-Akbari, and in the rent-roll of Bengali prepared by Akbar's Finance Ministers, Khwajah Muzaffar Ali and Todar Mall in 1582 A.C.\u2014(See J.A.S., 1873, p. 254, Tabaqat-i-Nasiri and Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi, Thomas's 'Initial Coinage'). In Akbar's rent-roll, the following 19 Sarkars are mentioned as composing the kingdom of Bengal Proper:\u2014\nanother, rendering them habitable in a beautiful form, ruled over\n\nSarkars North and East of the Ganges.\n\n1. Sarkar Lakhnauti or Jennatabad extending from Teliagadhi (near Cologong), including a few mahals now belonging to Bhagalpur and Purneah districts, and the whole of Maldah district. Sixty-six mahals; khasa revenue, Rs. 4,71,174.\n\n2. Sarkar Purneah, comprising a great portion of the present district of Purneah, as far as the Mahananda. Nine mahals; revenue Rs. 1,60,219.\n\n3. Sarkar Tajpur, extending over eastern Purneah, east of the Mahananda and western Dinajpur. Twenty-nine mahals; revenue Rs. 1,62,096.\n\n4. Sarkar Panjrah, north-east of the town of Dinajpur, comprising a large part of Dinajpur district. Twenty-one mahals; revenue Rs. 1,45,081.\n\n5.

Sarkar Barbakabad, comprising portions of Maldah, Dinajpur and large portions of Rajshahi and Bogra. Thirty-eight mahals; revenue Rs. 4,36,288.\n\n7. Sarkar Bazuba comprising portions of Rajshahi, Bogra, Pabna, Maimansingh, and reaching a little beyond the town of Dacca in the south. Thirty-two mahals; revenue Rs. 9,87,921.\n\n8. Sarkar Silhat. Eight mahals; revenue Rs. 1,67,032.\n\n9. Sarkar Sunargaon, extending to both sides of the Megna and the Brahmaputra, including portions of western Tipperah, eastern Dacca, Maimansingh and Noakhali. Fifty-two mahals; revenue Rs. 2,58,283.\u2014(See also Dr. Wise's 'note on Sunargaon,' J.A.S., 1874, No. 1, p. 82).\n\n10. Sarkar Chatgam. Seven mahals; revenue, Rs. 2,85,607.\n\nBarkars in the Delta of the Ganges.\n\n11. Sarkar Satgaon comprised a small portion to the west of the Hughli, whilst a large portion comprised the modern districts of the 24-Parganas to the Kabadak river, western Nadia, south-western Murshidabad, and extended in the south to Hatiagarh below Diamond Harbour. To this Sarkar belonged mahul Kalkatta (Calcutta) which together with 2 other mahals paid in 1582 a land revenue of Rs. 23,405. Fifty-three mahals; revenue Rs. 4,18,118.\u2014See also J.A.S., 1870, p. 280.\n\n12. Sarkar Mahmudabad, so called after Mahmud Shah, King of Bengal (846 A.H.), comprising north-eastern Nadia, north-eastern Jessore, and western Faridpur. Eighty-eight mahals; revenue, Rs. 2,90,256.\n\n13. Sarkar Khalifatabad, comprising southern Jessore and western Baqirganj (Backergunge). The Sarkar is so named after the haveli perganah Khalifatabad (or 'clearance of Khalifah' Kh\u00e2n Jah\u00e2n) near Bagerhat. The largest mahal of this Sarkar was Jesar (Jessore) or Rasulpur. Thirty-five mahals; revenue, Rs. 135,053. In this Sarkar is also Alaipur, which Professor Blochmann surmises to have been the residence of Sultan Alauddin Husain Shah, before the latter became King of Bengal.\nthe country. The first person who presided over the sovereignty\n\n14. Sark\u0101r Fathab\u0101d, so called after Fath Shah, King of Bengal (886 A.H.) comprising a small portion of Jessore, a large part of Faridpur, northern Baqirganj, a portion of Dhaka district, the island of Dakhin Shahbazpur, and Sondip, at the mouth of the Megna. The town of Faridpur lies in the haveli pargans of Fathab\u0101d. 31 mahals; revenue Rs. 1,99,239.\n\n15. Sark\u0101r Bakla or Bogla, south-east of the preceding, comprised portions of Baqirganj and Dhaka districts. Four mahals; revenue Rs. 1,78,756.\n\nSarkars South of the Ganges and West of the Bhagirati (Hughli.)\n\n16. Sarkar Udner, or Tandah, comprising the greater portion of Murshidabad district, with portion of Birbhum. Fifty-two mahals; revenue Rs. 6,01,985. Sulaiman Shah Kararani, the last but one of the Afghan Kings of Bengal, moved the seat of Government to Tandah from Gaur in 1564 A.C., that is, 11 years before the ruin of the latter.\u2014(Ain-i-Akbari, Vol. II, p. 130n.)\n\n17. Sarkar Sharifabad, south of the preceding, comprising remaining portions of Birbhum, and a large portion of Burdwan districts, including the town of Burdwan. Twenty-six mahals; revenue Rs. 5,62,218.\n\n18. Sarkar Sulaimanabad, so called after Sulaiman Shah, King of Bengal, comprising a few southern parganas in the modern districts of Nadia, Burdwan and the whole north of Hughli district. Pandua on the E. I. R. belonged to this Sarkar. The chief town of the Sarkar called Sulaimanabad (afterwards changed to Salimabad) was on the left bank of the Damudar, southeast of the town of Burdwan. Thirty-one mahals; revenue Rs. 4,40,749.\n\n19. Sarkar Madaran, extended in a semicircle from Nager in western Birbhum, over Raniganj along the Damudar to above Burdwan, and from there over Khand Ghosh, Jahauabad, Chandrakona (western Hughli district) to Mandalghat at the mouth of the Rupnarain river. Sixteen mahals; revenue Rs. 2,35,085.\n\nThe above 19 Sarkars which made up Bengal Proper in 1582, paid a revenue on khalsa lands (crown lands) inclusive of a few duties on salt, hats, and fisheries, of Rs. 6,3,37,052. According to Grant the value of jagir lands was fixed at Rs. 4,348,892, so that in 1582 A.C. and from before it, Rs. 10,685,944 was the total revenue of Bengal.\u2014(See J.A.S., 1873, p. 219). This was levied from ryots in specie, as the equivalent of the sixth share of the entire produce of the land, claimed by the sovereign as his share.\u2014(See Ain-i-Akbari), pp. 55 and 63, Vol. 2. This rent-roll remained in force during the reign of Jahangir. Under Shah Jah\u0101n, the boundaries of Bengal were extended on the south-west, Medinipur and Hijli having been annexed to Bengal, and in the east and north-east by conquests in Tipperah and Koch Hajo; and when Prince Shuja was made Governor of Bengal he made about 1658 A.C., a new rent-roll which shewed 34 Sarkars and 1,350 mahals, and a total revenue, in khalsa and jagir lands, of Rs. 1,81,15,907.\u2014(See J.A.S., 1873, p. 219). Shuja's rent-roll remained in force till 1722 A.C., an addition having been made after the re-conquest of Chittagong, and conquest of Assam and Koch Behar in Aurangzeb's time. In\nof the country of Bengal was R\u0101j\u0101h Bh\u0101girat,\u00b9 of the Khatri tribe. For a long period he held the sovereignty of Bengal. At length he went to Delhi and was killed with Darj\u016bdhan\u00b2 in the wars of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rat. His period of rule was 250 years. After this, 23 persons amongst his descendants, one after another, ruled for a period of nearly 2,200 years.\u00b3 After that, the sovereignty passed\n\nthat year, Naw\u0101b Jafar Kh\u0101n (Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n) prepared his \u2018K\u0101mil Jama\u2019 Tumari\u2019, or \u2018perfect rent-roll\u2019, in which Bengal was divided into 34 Sarkars, forming 18 chakl\u0101s, and subdivided into 1,660 perganas, with a revenue of Rs. 1,43,88,186. After the rule of Naw\u0101b Jafar Kh\u0101n, Abw\u0101b revenue (imposts as fees, &c.), appeared in the books. In the time of Shuja Kh\u0101n, Naw\u0101b Jafar\u2019s successor, the Abw\u0101bs (see Blochmann\u2019s Contributions and Grant\u2019s report) amounted to Rs. 21,72,962, and they rapidly increased under Naw\u0101bs Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n and Kasim Kh\u0101n, so that when the E.I. Company in 1765 acquired the Dewani from Emperor Shah Alam, the net amount of all revenue collected in Bengal Proper was (see Grant\u2019s report) Rs. 2,56,24,223.\n\nI respectfully differ, however, from Professor Blochmann\u2019s conclusions on one point. He would seem to suggest that the above extent of territory with the above Revenue, as gathered from Todar Mal\u2019s rent-roll prepared in 1582 and also from the Ain-i-Akbari, Iqbalnamah, Padshahnamah and Alamgirnamah, might be taken to represent the territorial and fiscal strength of the Musalman Bengal kingdom of pre-Mughal times \u2014 (J.A.S., 1873, p. 214). This inference is vitiated, in view of the fact that the Musalman Bengal kingdom in pre-Mughal times included for the most part the whole of north Behar, and, under several Musalman Bengal rulers, also south Behar as far westward as Sarkars Mungher and Behar, besides Orissa. This consideration would indicate that the territorial and financial strength of the Musalman Bengal kingdom in pre-Mughal times was greater than what is arrived at in Professor Blochmann\u2019s conclusions. In the Ain-i-Akbari, Orissa is included in the S\u016bbah of Bengal, Orissa consisting of 5 Sarkars. Thus, the S\u016bbah of Bengal is described as consisting of 24 Sarkars (that is, including 5 Sarkars of Orissa), and 787 mahals, and the revenue is stated to be Rs. 1,49,61,482-15-7.\u2014(See Ain, Vol. II, p. 129). Mutamad Khan who was attached to Emperor Jahangir\u2019s Court, in his account of the seventh year of Jahangir\u2019s reign, states that the revenue of Bengal was one Kror and fifty laks in rupees.\u2014(Vide Iqbalnamah-i-Jahangiri, p. 60).\n\n\u00b9 R\u0101j\u0101h Bh\u0101girat or Bhagdat, son of Narak, had his Capital at the city of Pragjyotispur (identified with the modern Gauhati), is described in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rat as espousing the cause of Darj\u016bdhan, and as being slain by the victorious Arj\u016bn. According to the Ain-i-Akbari, p. 144, Vol. 2, Bh\u0101girat or Bhagdat had twenty-three successors in his dynasty.\n\n\u00b2 According to the Ain, p. 147, Jarj\u016bdhan.\n\n\u00b3 This is the period during which his dynasty ruled. In the Ain, p. 144, 2418 years.\nfrom his family to Noj Gouriah, who belonged to the Kyesth tribe, and for 250 years he and his eight descendants ruled. The fortune of sovereignty passed from his family also to Adisun, who was also a Kyesth, and eleven persons, including himself and his descendants, ascending the throne, ruled for 714 years over the Kingdom of Bengal. And afterwards the sovereignty passing from his family to Bhupal Kyesth, the latter with his descendants, forming ten persons, ruled over this kingdom for a period of 698 years. When their fortune decayed, Sukh Sen Kyesth with his descendants, numbering seven persons, ruled over the Kingdom of Bengal (Bangalah) for 160 years. And these sixty-one persons ruled absolutely over this kingdom for a period of 4,240 years. And when the period of their fortune was over, their fortune ended. Sukh Sen, of the Boido caste, became ruler; and after ruling for three years over this kingdom, died. After this, Ballal Sen, who built the fort of Gaur, occupied the throne of sovereignty for fifty years, and died. After this, Lakhman Sen for seven years, after him Madh\u016b Sen for ten years, after him Kaisu Sen for fifteen years, after him Sad\u0101 Sen for eighteen years, and after him Nauj for three years ruled. When the turns of these were over, R\u0101jah Lakhmaniah, son of Lakhman, sat on the throne. At that time, the seat of government of the Rajas of Bengal was Nadiah, and this Nadiah is a well-known city, and a seat of Hindu learning. At present, though compared with the past, it is dilapidated and in ruin, still it is famous for its learning. The astrologers of that place, who were known over the world for their proficiency in astrology and soothsayings, unitedly\n\n---\n\n1 In the Ain, p. 145, \"Bhoj Gauriah;\"\n2 In the Ain, p. 145, \"520 years.\"\n3 In the Ain, \"Adisun.\"\n4 In the Ain, p. 146, \"106 years.\"\n5 In the Ain, \"45 44\" years.\n6 In the Ain, \"Sukh Sin.\" He is not described as a Boido;\n7 In the Ain, \"Nangah.\"\n8 In Ferishta \"Lakhmanah\"; in Tabaqat-i-Nasiri \"Lakhmaniah.\"\n9 In Tabaqat-i-Nasiri, \"Nadiyah\" or \"new isle.\" According to current legends, it was founded in 1063 A.C. by Lakhman Sen, son of Ballal Sen, who resided partly at Gaur, and principally at Bikrampur; in Dacca district. Muhammad Bahtiar Khilji in 594 A.H. or 1198 A.C. stormed the fort of Nadiah, and conquered Bengal with eighteen troopers\u2014a sad commentary on the feebleness of the Hindu Rajah!\nat the time of delivery, informed Lakhmani\u0101's mother, that at this hour, an unlucky child would be born, who would bring about bad luck and misfortune, and that if it be born after two hours, it would succeed to the throne. This heroine ordered that both her legs should be bound together, and she should be suspended with her head downwards; and after two hours she came down, and the child was brought forth at the auspicious moment, but its mother died. R\u0101j\u0101h Lakhmani\u0101 for eighty years occupied the throne. In justice, he had no equal, and in liberality he had no match. It is said that his gifts amounted to no less than one hundred thousand. Towards the end of his life, when the perfection of the period of his sovereignty approached decay, the astrologers of that place said to R\u0101j\u0101h Lakhmani\u0101: \"From our knowledge of astrology, we have come to know, that shortly your sovereignty would come to an end, and that your religion would cease to be current in this kingdom.\" Rai Lakhmani\u0101, not regarding this prediction as truthful, put the cotton of neglect and ignorance in his ear, but many of the \u00e9lite of that city secretly moved away to different places. And this prediction was fulfilled by the invasion of Malik Ikhtiar\u016b-d-din Muhammad Bakhtiar Khilji, as will be soon related hereafter.\n\nAN ACCOUNT OF THE DOMINATION OF CERTAIN HIND\u016a RAIS OVER THE KINGDOM OF BENGAL, AND OF THE CAUSE OF THE INTRODUCTION OF IDOL-WORSHIP IN HIND\u016aST\u0100N.\n\nBe it not hidden that, in ancient times, the Rais of the Kingdom of Bengal (Bang\u0101lah) were powerful, and of high rank and dignity, and did not owe allegiance to the Mah\u0101r\u0101jah of Hind\u016bst\u0101n, who ruled over the throne at Delhi. For instance, S\u016braj,\n\n1 This account is repeated in several Musalman histories, such as Tabaqat-i-Nai\u1e63ri, Ferishta, Ain-i-Akbari. The Tabaqat, p. 151, being the nearest contemporary record, may be specially referred to, especially as its author, Minhaju-s-Siraj, shortly after, in 641 A.H. visited Lakhnauti. One lak cowrie is meant.\n\n2 Minhaju-s-Siraj in the Tabaqat, pp. 150 and 151, pays a high eulogium to this R\u0101j\u0101h, and extols his virtues and liberality, and winds up by saying: \"May God lessen his punishment in the next world!\" Verily, Minhaj was himself liberal in his views!\n\n3 In Ferishta (Per. text), Vol. I, p. 121, Bahdaj, father of S\u016braj, is described as descended from Noah. It is worthy of note, that in the district of Monghyr,\nwho was a powerful R\u0101j\u0101h, subjugated the Kingdom of Dakhin (Dakin). At that time, his deputies commenced grasping and usurping; and in the Kingdom of Hind\u016bst\u0101n, idol-worship dates from his time. It is said that, in the beginning, Hind, having seen and heard from his father H\u0101m, son of Noah (peace be on him!) devoted himself to the worship of God; and that his children also, in the same manner, worshipped God, until, in the time of Rai Mah\u0101r\u0101j,\u00b9 a person coming from Persia perverted the people of Hind\u016bst\u0101n to sun-worship. I fluxen of time, some became star-worshippers, and others fire-worshippers. In the time of Rai S\u016braj, a Brahmin, coming from the mountains of Jharkand,\u00b2 entered his service, and taught the Hind\u016bs idol-worship, and preached that everyone preparing a gold or silver or stone image of his father and grandfather, should devote himself to its worship; and this practice became more common than other practices. And at the present day in the religious practice of Hind\u016bs, the worship of idols, and of the sun, and of fire is very common. Some say that fire-worship was introduced by Ibr\u0101him Zardasht\u00b3 in\n\non the southern bank of the Ganges, near Maulanagar, there is a town called \"S\u016brajgarh,\" or \"fort of S\u016braj.\" Might not this place have been the birthplace or seat of government of R\u0101j\u0101h S\u016braj in the text? The locality is one which would facilitate his excursion into the Dakhin through the defiles of the Vindhya range, of which the text speaks.\n\n1 This is apparently a mistake in the text for \"Rai Bahdaj,\" who is mentioned in Ferishta as the father of Rai S\u016braj, and as a descendant of Noah.\n\n2 We meet with the name of \"Jharkand\" in the \"Akbarnamah\"; it was the Musalman appellation of \"Chutia Nagpur\" just as Bharkund was the Musalman appellation of \"Sonthal Parganna.\"\n\nThe Aryans must have fallen very low in the scale of spiritualism, to have needed lessons in religion from a preceptor hailing from Chutia Nagpur, who was apparently a Dravidian or Sonthali Brahman.\n\nThis imprisonment of \"spiritual light\" from the defiles of Chutia Nagpur tract, in the time of R\u0101j\u0101h S\u016braj, strengthens my surmise that S\u016brajgarh, which is not far from Chutia Nagpur, was the home or residence of R\u0101j\u0101h S\u016braj. It may also be noted that the Sonthalese worship images of their ancestors, which worship is referred to in the text.\n\n3 Zaidasht or Zartha\u0161t or Zardahasht is the name of a person descended from Man\u016bchahar, and a disciple of Tythagorai. During the reign of Emperor Gashasp of Persia he claimed to be a prophet, and introduced fire-worship. The Magians regard him as a prophet, and say that his name was Ibrahim, and consider his book the Zend (or Zendavarte), as a revealed book. He is supposed to have been the Zoroaster of the Greeks.\nthe title of G\u0101sht\u0101sp, Emperor of Persia, and spread to K\u0101bul and S\u012bst\u0101n and throughout the empire of Persia, and that, in process of time, the kingdom of Bengal became subject to the R\u0101is of Hind\u016bst\u0101n, and the R\u0101is of Bengal paid revenue and sundry tributes. After this, Shangald\u012bp, emerging from the environs of Koch, became victorious over Kid\u0101r, and founded the city of Gaur, and made it the seat of government, and for a period ruled over the Kingdom of Bengal and the whole empire of Hind\u016bst\u0101n. When Shangald\u012bp collected four thousand elephants, one lak cavalry, and four laks of infantry, the breeze of insolence wafted in the recesses of his brain, and he ceased to pay tribute to the Emperors of Persia, as was hitherto the practice with the R\u0101is of Hind\u016bst\u0101n. And when Afr\u0101si\u0101b deputed some one to demand the tribute, he rebuked and insulted him. Afr\u0101si\u0101b flew into rage, and despatched his General, Piran-visah, with fifty thousand\n\n1 G\u0101sht\u0101sp or Keshtab was the Darius Hystaspus of the Greeks, and belonged to the K\u0101sinian dynasty; his son, Isfandiar, was the Xerxes of the Greeks, and his grandson, Bahman, was the Artaxerxes Longimanus of the Greeks. (See Namah-i-Khusruan, p. 59).\n\n2 In Ferishta, \"Shangald\u012bp\" is called \"Sharigal,\" and so in the text in another place. In Ferishta (Persian text), Vol. 2, p. 238, the following account of Shangald\u012bp or Shangal appears: \"Shangal, towards the close of the reign of B\u0101j\u0101h Ked\u0101r Brahman, emerging from the environs of Koch (Koch Behar) won a victory over Kedar, and founded the City of Lakhmanti, which is otherwise known as Gaur. Shangal mobilized a force of four thousand elephants, one lak cavalry, and five lak infantry, and stopped paying tribute to Afr\u0101si\u0101b, the King of T\u016bran or Tartary or Scythia. Becoming enraged, Afr\u0101si\u0101b deputed his generalissimo, Piran-Visah, with fifty thousand cavalry, to chastise Shangal.\" The rest of the account of Ferishta tallies with that in the text.\n\n3 Koch Behar used to be known in early days as the tract of the \"Koch tribe\" or simply as \"Koch.\"\n\n4 \"Iran\" or Persia here in the text is evidently a mistake for \"T\u016bran\" or Tartary or Scythia, of which Afr\u0101si\u0101b was monarch. This indicates the subjection of India (like Persia) to the Scythians at a remote period.\n\n5 Afr\u0101si\u0101b (conqueror of Persia) was an ancient king of T\u016bran or Tartary or Scythia. He was a Mongol by birth. He conquered Persia, killed Nasar with his own hand, and reigned there for about twelve years, about seven centuries before the Christian era, but was subsequently driven beyond the Oxus by a famous chief called Zalsar. Afr\u0101si\u0101b again overran Persia, but was at last defeated and slain in Arzibij\u0101n by Zalsar and his celebrated son, Mustam, the Persian Hercules. Afr\u0101si\u0101b appears, however, to have been a family surname, like the Pharaohs, the Ptolemys, the C\u00e6sars.\nMongols, thirsty for blood. In the mountains of Koch, near the limits of Ghor\u0101ghat, in Bengal, an engagement took place; for two days and nights the fighting continued. Although the Mongols displayed deeds of bravery, and put to the sword fifty thousand of the enemy, yet owing to the overwhelming numbers of the Indian army, they could effect nothing. The Mongols also lost eighteen thousand of their numbers, and on the third day, seeing symptoms of defeat on the forehead of their condition, they retreated. And as the Indian army was victorious, and the Mongol's country was distant, the Mongols gave up fighting, and retiring into the mountains, secured a strong place, where they entrenched themselves, and sent to Afr\u0101si\u0101b an account narrating the state of things. At that time, Afr\u0101si\u0101b was in the town of Gangdozh, which is situate midway between Kha\u1e6d\u0101 and China, and is distant a month's journey on the other side from Kh\u0101nba-ligh. On the simple receipt of the account, and being apprised of the state of things, he marched swiftly to the aid of the Mongols, with one lak chosen cavalry. And at a time, when Shangal, summoning together the R\u0101\u012bs of the surrounding countries, was pressing the siege hard against Pir\u0101n, and was about to put all to the sword, he (Afr\u0101si\u0101b) attacked him on the way. The Hind\u016bs, on the first onslaught, losing heart and feeling paralysed, dispersed, like the constellation of the bear. Pir\u0101n, relieved from the anxiety of the siege, paid his obeisance to Afr\u0101si\u0101b. Afr\u0101si\u0101b threw down on the soil of annihilation as many of the Hindu army as he could. And Shangal with the remnants being vanquished, retreated to the town of Lakhnauti, and owing to the pursuit of Afr\u0101si\u0101b, could not prolong his stay at Lakhnauti more than a day, and took refuge in the hills of T\u012brh\u016bt. And the Mongols, ravaging the Kingdom of Bengal, spared no trace of fertility. And when Afr\u0101si\u0101b planned an expedition towards the hills of T\u012brh\u016bt, Shangal begged forgiveness for his misbehaviour through wise envoys, and presented himself before Afr\u0101si\u0101b with a sword and a winding-sheet, and prayed for leave to go to the country of T\u016br\u0101n. Afr\u0101si\u0101b, being pleased, bestowed the Kingdom of Bengal and the whole empire of Hindust\u0101n on Shangal's son, and carried Shangal in his company, and in the battle of H\u0101m\u0101-\n\n1 The capital of China used to be called in those days \"Khanbaligh,\" or \"City of the Great Kh\u0101n.\"\nw\u0101ran Shangal was killed at the hands of Rustam.1 And in the reign of R\u0101j\u0101h Jaichand,2 owing to whose neglect, decay had overtaken several provinces of Hind\u016bst\u0101n, and for years Hind\u016bst\u0101n did not see its normal state, ruin was visible over the whole empire of India. At that time, certain R\u0101j\u0101hs of Bengal, finding an opportunity, and grasping at domination, became independent. And when F\u016br (Porus),3 who was a relation of the R\u0101j\u0101h of Kum\u0101y\u016bn,4 emerged, he first subjugated the province of Kum\u0101y\u016bn, and then capturing in battle R\u0101j\u0101h D\u0101hl\u016b, brother of Jaichand, who had founded Dehli,5 subjugated Kan\u016bj, and after this he marched with his force towards Bengal, and brought it to his subjection, up to the confines of the sea. And this Porus is he, who was killed at the\n\n---\n\n1 Rustam, the Persian Heroules. He was a successful general under the first kings of the Kaianian dynasty, in their wars of defence against the incursions into Persia of the Turanian or Scythian monarchs. For a graphic account of those stirring warfares between the Scythians or Turanians or Mongolians and Iranians or Persians, see \"Shahnamah\" of Firdausi, the Homer of the East. It is worthy of note that Firdausi, in his immortal Persian epic, gives also the name of an Indian prince as Shangal, in connection with the adventures of Bahram Gaur, a Persian monarch of the Sassanian dynasty, who reigned in the middle of the fourth century. Perhaps, this later Shangal was a descendant of the original Shangal taken captive by Afrasiab, the Scythian monarch. In this connection, it may also be noted for grasping chronological relations referred to in the text, that there were the following four dynasties of old Persian kings: (1) Peshdadians, including the Kaimuras, the Jamshids, and the Farid\u016bns; (2) the Kaianians, founded by Kaikubad about 600 B.C., including Khusrav or Kai Khusrav, Bahman, and Darah or Darius &c. (3) Ashkanins, including Hormuz, &c., &c. (4) the Sassanians, founded in 202 A.C. by Ardisher Babegan, including Bahram Gaur and Naushirvan, &c. (See Namai-Khanarun, a short Persian History of Persia by Mirza Muhammad).\n\n2 At the time when Sult\u0101n Muizuddin Muhammad Sam alias Shah\u0101b-udin Ghori, made incursions into Hindust\u0101n, R\u0101j\u0101h Jaichand Rathor ruled at Kanauj and Benares, and R\u0101j\u0101h Pethaura Tonwar ruled at Delhi. Tabagat, p. 120.\n\n3 But it must be noted that there is in the text (probably owing to mistake of the copyist of the original manuscript text) a confusion in the sequence of events related.\n\n4 In the neighbourhood of the Panjab, Alexander gave battle to the Hind\u016b prince, Porus, who had advanced from Kanauj, and put him to rout.\n\n5 Ab\u016bl Fa\u1e63l in the Ain says: \"A part of the northern mountains of the Subash of Delhi is called Kumayunn.

For the most part, they consist of a huge mass of mythological fictions, to extract a few grains of sober historical truth wherefrom, I must leave to more competent hands. Yet it is worthy of note (as our author's narrative indicates) that India and Bengal in very early times had political connection of some sort with Scythia and (through the latter) with Persia. It is probable that ethnologically, these Scythian incursions resulted to a great extent in an admixture of Scythian and Aryan races in India, which admixture was further complicated by the subsequent Dravidian incursions from the south.\nCHAPTER I.\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF THE RULE OF THE MUSALMAN RULERS WHO RULED OVER THIS KINGDOM OF BENGAL, AS VICEROYS OF THE EMPERORS OF DELHI.\n\nBe it not hidden from the enlightened hearts of those who enquire into the histories of Musalman sovereigns and rulers, that the commencement of the effulgence of the sun of the Muhammedan faith in the Kingdom of Bengal, dates from the period of the reign of Sult\u0101n Qutb\u016bn-d-d\u012bn Aibak,\u00b9 Emperor of\n\n\u00b9 This period extended from 1198 A.C. to 1388 A.C.\n\n\u00b2 This is not quite accurate. Bengal was conquered by Bakhtiar Khilj-al-Ghasi (Tabaqat-i-Nasiri, p. 146), in 594 A.H. or 1198 A.C. (for the discussion of the date, see Tabaqat, p. 150, and Blochmann's contribution to history of Bengal), whilst Emperor Shahabuddin Ghori alias Muizuddin Muhammad Sam was yet alive, and whilst Qutbuddin Aibak ruled at Delhi, as the latter's Indian Viceroy, that is, only 7 years after the Musalman occupation of Delhi, which took place in 587 A.H. or 1191 A.C. (Tabaqat, pp. 139, 140 and 128). He was called \"Aibak,\" because his little finger was feeble or paralyzed (Tabaqat, p. 138), whilst according to another account, \"Aibak\" signified the \"brilliant chief.\" His name is preserved in his Capital by the Qutb mosque and by the Qutb Minar, though these were erected to commemorate other more or less forgotten worthies. Bakhtiar Khilji in the first instance conquered Bengal on his own initiative, though he acknowledged the nominal suzerainty of Shahabuddin and subsequently of Qutbuddin, when the latter mounted the throne of Delhi (Tabaqat, p. 140). That this was so, appears from the circumstance that in the list of Maliks and Sultans under Shahabuddin alias Muiz-d-din contained in Tabaqat (pp. 146 and 137), Bakhtiar is assigned a co-ordinate position with Qutbuddin. In this connection, it is worth noting that owing to a popular and common fallacy, these early pre-Mughul Moslem rulers of India have been described as 'Pathan rulers of India.' As pointed out by Major Raverty in his translation of Tabaqat-i-Nasiri, neither the Ghoris, nor their slaves, \"the Slave-kings of Delhi,\" nor the Tughluks, nor the Khiljis were Afghans or Pathans, but that they were all Turkish tribes. (See also Tabaqat-i-Nasiri, p. 150, where the expression \"Turk\u0101n\" or 'Turks' is constantly employed, with reference to the first Musalman conquerors of Behar and Bengal).\nDelhi. And the origin of the title \"Aibak\" is that his little finger was feeble; hence he was called 'Aibak.' When Sultan Qutbuddin in 590 A.H. wrested by force the fort of Kol from the Hindus, and captured one thousand horses and an immense booty, the news spread that Sultan Mu'izzu-d-din Muhammad Sam, also called Sultan Shahabu-d-din, had planned expeditions for the conquests of Kanuj and Banaras. Sultan Qutbuddin marched forward from Kol to receive him, presented to him the booty of Kol with other valuables, and becoming recipient of a special Khila't, formed the vanguard of the imperial forces, and marched ahead. And engaging in battle with the forces of the Rajah of Banaras, he routed them, and at length, slaying on the battle-field Rajah Jaichand, the Rajah of Banaras, he became victorious. Sultan Shahabu-d-din, marching with a force from the rear, moved up and entered the city of Banaras, and pillaging the whole of that tract up to the confines of Bengal, carried off as booty incalculable treasures and jewels. The Sultan then returned to Ghazni. And the Kingdom of Bengal as an adjunct of the Empire of Delhi, was left in the hands of Qutbuddin. Sultan Qutbuddin entrusted to Malik Ikhtiaru-d-din Muhammad Bakhtiar Khilji the Viceroyalty of the Provinces of Behar and Lakhnauti.1 Muhammad Bakhtiar, who was one of the\n\nAccording to the 'Masalik-ul-Mumalik,' says Major Haverty in an article in A.S.J. for 1875, No. 1, p. 37, \"the Khalj are a tribe of Turks which in former times settled in Garmsir, between Sijistan and the region of Hind. They are in appearance and dress like Turks, and observe the customs of that race, and all speak the Turkish language.\" The Khalja or Khiljis have been by several writers erroneously confounded with the Afghan tribe of \"Ghalzis\" or \"Ghiljis.\" The first Afghan or 'Pathan' who sat on the throne of Delhi was Sultan Bahadur of the Lodi tribe, the thirtieth Musalman ruler of India, counting from Qutbuddin Aibak.\n\n1 It is worthy of note that in the times of Bakhtiar Khilji and his immediate successors, South Behar was included in the Bengal or Lakhnauti, Viceroyalty. South Behar was separated from the Bengal Viceroyalty in 622 H. by Emperor Altamsh who placed it under a distinct governor, named Alauddin Jani. On withdrawal of the Emperor, Behar was again annexed by the Bengal ruler, Ghiasuddin (see Tabagat-i-Nasiri, p. 163). It continued to be a part of the Bengal Kingdom till 1320, when Emperor Ghiasuddin Tughlak again separated it. Behar belonged to the Sharqi Kingdom of Jaunpur from 1397 A.C.; again under Ibrahim, Bahadur Khan, son of Governor Darya Khan, assumed independence in Behar, with the title of Shah Muhammad, and about 1498 A.C. or about 908 A.H. South Behar\nchiefs of Ghor\u00b9 and Garmsir, was a brave man, well-built and very strong.\u00b2 In the beginning, he was in the service of Sultan Shab\u0101bu-d-din Gho\u0159i at Ghazni. He was allowed a small allowance, as neither he was externally prepossessing, nor was his appearance grand. Becoming despondent, Muhammad Bakhtiar came to Hindustan in the company of the Sultan, stayed behind, and did not even then get into the good graces of the Ministers of Hindustan. Departing thence, he went to Bard\u0101w\u016bn\u00b3 to Anghal Beg who was the ruler over the Doab country, and there gaining in eminence, he advanced himself to the exalted office of generalissimo. And the tract of Kamb\u0101lah\u2074 and Bet\u0101li was given to him as a jagir. From there he went in the service of Malik Hassama-d-din\u2075 to the \u0160ubah of Audh (Oude). Subduing again became more or less subject to the Musalman Kings of Gaur, Husain Shah and Nasrat Shah. Under the early Mughul Emperors, Behar was again formed into a distinct \u0160ubah, but under the later Mughuls, it again became incorporated along with Orissa in the great Bengal Viceroyalty. North Behar appears to have been generally included in the Musalm\u0101n Kingdom of Bengal (see Tarikh-i-Firuz Shah\u012b, pp. 451 and 586).\n\n\u00b9 Ab\u016bl Fazl places \u2018Gho\u0159\u2019 to the north of Kandahar, and \u2018Garmsir\u2019 to the west of Kandahar. In \u2018Garmsir\u2019 lay the city of Ferozkoh, the capital of the Ghorian Sultans.\n\n\u00b2 Tabaqat-i-Nasiri, (Pers. text, p. 146) which is the nearest contemporary account, describes Bakhtiar Khilji as \u201cactive, agile, brave, bold, learned and intelligent.\u201d It says that he went to Ghazni to seek service under Sultan Muizuddin, but owing to his slender appearance was rejected by the Sultan\u2019s War Minister. Disappointed, Bakhtiar came to Delhi, where also he was rejected by the War Minister (Dewan-i-\u2018Arz).\n\n\u00b3 In Tabaqat-i-Nasiri p. 147, which is the most reliable account, \u2018Badaon.\u2019 The Tabaqat mentions the name of the feudatory of Badaon to be Sipasalar Hazbaru-d-din Hasan Arnab.\n\n\u2074 Major Raverty identifies Bakhtiar Khilji\u2019s jagir lands with the parganahs of \u2018Bhagwat and Bhooli,\u2019 south of Benaras, and east of Ch\u016bnargarh. Professor Blochmann considers this identification satisfactory. (See Raverty\u2019s translation of Tabaqat-i-Nasiri and Blochmann\u2019s contr. to history and Geography of Bengal).\n\n\u2075 This account does not accord strictly with what is contained in the Tabaqat-i-Nasiri, (Pers. text, p. 147), the nearest contemporary account for the period. In Tabaqat, it is stated that after being rejected by War Ministers both at Ghazni and at Delhi, owing to his slender appearance, Bakhtiar Khilji proceeded to Badaon, presented himself before its feudal baron, general Hazbaru-d-din Hassan Arnab, who allotted him a fixed pay, that thence Bakhtiar proceeded to Oudh and presented himself before its feudal\nthat province, he advanced himself further in rank and dignity. When the fame of his bravery and liberality, and the reputation of his heroism and gallantry, spread over the confines of Hindustan, Sultan Qutbuddin who, not yet ascending the throne of Delhi, was still at Lahore, sent to him valuable Khilat, and summoned him to his presence, and granting to him an illuminated Farm\u0101n of Chieftainship over the province of Behar, deputed him there. And Muhammad Bakhtiar marching quickly to that side, spared no measure of slaughter and pillage. It is said that in Behar there was a Hindu Library which fell into the hands of Muhammad Bakhtiar. The latter enquired from the Brahmins as to the reason for the collection of the books. The Brahmins replied that the whole town formed a college, and that in the Hindi language a college was called Behar, and that hence that town was so called. After this, when Muhammad Bakhtiar being victorious returned to the service of the Sultan, he became more renowned and enviable than other servants. And his rank was advanced so much, that the juice of envy set flowing amongst Sultan Qutbuddin's other officers, who burned in the fire of envy and shame, and combined to expel and destroy him, so much so, that one day in the presence of the Sultan, in regard to his strength and prowess, they said unanimously that Muhammad Bakhtiar, owing to exuberance of strength, wanted to fight with an elephant. The Sultan wondering questioned him. Muhammad Bakhtiar did not disavow this false boastfulness, though he knew that the object of the associates of the king was to destroy him. In short, one day when all the people, the \u00e9lite as well as the general public, assembled in\n\nbaron, Malik Hassamuddin Ughalbak, who conferred on him fiefs of Sahlat and Sahli (identified with Bhagwat and Bhoeli), and finding him brave and bold sent him (apparently on reconnoitering expeditions) towards Munir near Patna, and Behar town. In these reconnoitering expeditions for one or two years, Bakhtiar gathered a large booty, when the Delhi Viceroy (Qutbuddin) recognized tardily Bakhtiar's merits. It would thus appear that but for Bakhtiar's own tenacity, the stupidity of the War ministers of Ghaznin and Delhi would have robbed the Indo-Moslem Empire of a valuable recruit, and perhaps postponed indefinitely its rapid expansion towards Behar and Bengal!\n\n1 In Tabaqat-i-Nasiri, pp. 147 and 148 it is stated that Bakhtiar presented himself before the gate of the fort of Behar with two hundred horse-girths and armours covered with fur-cloth (\u0628\u064e\u0631\u0652\u06af\u064e\u0634\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0627\u0646), and stormed the fort, and that Bakhtiar had with him at the time two wise brothers, named Nizamuddin and Samsamuddin (of Farghana).\nDarbar, a white rogue elephant was brought to the White Castle (Qasr-i-Sufed). Muhammad Bakhtiar tying up the loin of his garment on the waist, came out to the field, struck the elephant's trunk with a mace, when the elephant ran away roaring. All the spectators, including those assembled, and the envious, raising shouts of applause to the sky, were confounded. The Sultan bestowing on Malik Muhammad Bakhtiar special Khilat and many gifts, ordered the nobles to bestow on him presents, so that all the nobles gave him numerous largesses. Muhammad Bakhtiar, in the same assembly, adding his own quota to all the largesses, distributed the same amongst those present. In short, at this time, the Viceroyalty of the Kingdoms of Behar and Lakhnauti was bestowed on him; and with peace of mind, having gained his object, he proceeded to the metropolis of Delhi. That year Malik Bakhtiar, bringing to subjugation the Subah of Behar, engaged in introducing administrative arrangements, and the second year coming to the Kingdom of Bengal, he planted military outposts in every place, and set out for the town of Nadia, which at that time was the Capital of the Rajahs of Bengal. The Rajah of that place, whose name was Lakhmania, and who had reigned for eighty years over that Kingdom, was at the time taking his food.\n\n1 The second year after his conquest of Behar, Bakhtiar Khilji set out for Bengal, stormed Nadia, and conquered Bengal. Therefore, the conquest of Behar took place in 592 A.H. or 1196 A.C.\n\nThe text is not strictly in accord with the account given in the Tabaqat-i-Nasiri which is the most reliable and the nearest contemporary account for the period. Whilst in the service of the feudatory of Oudh (Tabaqat, Pers. text, p. 147), Bakhtiar reconnoitered Behar for one or two years, and carried off much plunder. Qutb-ud-din, the Delhi Viceroy, then called Bakhtiar to Lahore tardily recognized his merits, and loaded him with presents. Bakhtiar returned to Behar, and conquered it, and carrying off again a large booty, presented himself to Qutb-ud-din at Delhi, where he had to undergo a gladiatorial ordeal at the White Castle (Qasr-i-Sufed of Delhi), and then receiving presents from Qutb-ud-din, returned to Behar, and the second year after his conquest of Behar, he invaded and conquered Bengal, storming and sacking Nadia, and establishing himself at the village or mouza of Lakhnauti (Tabaqat-i-Nasiri, p. 151). This would indicate that Lakhnauti was founded by him, and was distinct from Gaur, though possibly close to it.\n\n2 The Tabaqat (Pers. text, p. 151) states that the Rajah (Lakhmania) was then sitting in his inner apartments, with his food set before him in gold and silver plates, when the sudden inrush of Bakhtiar Khilji with eighteen troopers, struck terror, and the Rajah ran out bare-foot by a back-door, and fled to\nSuddenly, Muhammad Bakhtiar, with eighteen horsemen, made an onslaught, so that before the Rajah was aware, Bakhtiar burst inside the palace, and unsheathing from the scabbard his sword that lightened and thundered, engaged in fighting, and put the harvest of the life of many to his thundering and flashing sword. Rajah Lakhmani getting confounded by the tumult of this affair, left behind all his treasures and servants and soldiers, and slipped out bare-foot by a back-door, and embarking on a boat, fled towards Kamrup. Muhammad Bakhtiar sweeping the town with the broom of devastation, completely demolished it, and making anew the city of Lakhmani, which from ancient times was the seat of Government of Bengal, his own metropolis, he ruled over Bengal peacefully, introduced the Khutbah, and minted coin in the name of Sultan Qutbuddin, and strove to put in practice the ordinances of the Muhammadan religion. From that\n\nSanknat and Bang, his treasures, harem, slaves and servants and women and elephants all falling into Bakhtiar's hands.\n\nSome copies of the Tabaqat-i-Nasiri have 'Saknat' and also 'Sanknat.' Tabaqat-i-Akbari has \"Jagannath.\"\n\nAccording to other and more reliable accounts, the Rajah fled from Nadiah to Bikrampur, south-east of Dacca. I think therefore \"\u0643\u0646\u0627\u062a \u0648 \u0628\u0646\" in the printed text of the Tabaqat-i-Nasiri is a copyist's mistake for \"\u0633\u0643\u064a\u0646\u0647 \u0628\u0646,\" meaning the Rajah's \"Bengal Residence\" which was at Bikrampur from before.\n\nKamrud (or Kamrup) as well as Sanknat and Bang is mentioned in the Tabaqat (Pers. text, p. 150), in connection with the previous flight from Nadiah of Brahmins and Sahas who hearing of Bakhtiar's prowess and of his conquest of Behar, anticipated Bakhtiar's invasion of Bengal, and had advised the Rajah to shift with all his troops and people from Nadiah to his residence in East Bengal (at Bikrampur). The astrologers had also prepared the Rajah for Bakhtiar's conquest. But the Rajah was deaf to all advice, whilst the Brahmins and Sahas had fled. It is opposed to the probabilities of the case that the subsequent defeat of the Rajah by eighteen troopers of Bakhtiar was brought about by any foul play or stratagem from one side or the other; because the Rajah was a good, noble and generous prince, and the idol of his people, and even the Musalman historian (author of the Tabaqat-i-Nasiri) pays him a glowing tribute. (See Tabaqat, p. 149).\n\nMuhammad Bakhtiar Khilji was not a military marauder or a religious fanatic. He was, no doubt, a champion of Islam, but at the same time combined in himself all the qualities of a great general and a wise statesman. We read in the Tabaqat-i-Nasiri (Pers. text, p. 151), that both in Behar and Bengal, just after their conquest, he established Mosques, Colleges, Khanqahs\ndate the Kingdom of Bengal became subject to the Emperors of Delhi. Malik Ikhtiarud-din Muhammad Bakhtiar was the first Muhammadan ruler of Bengal in the year 599 A.H. when Sultan Qutbu-d-din after conquest of the fort of Kalinjar proceeded to the town of Mahubah which is below Kalpi and conquered it, Malik Muhammad Bakhtiar going from Behar to wait on him, met the Sultan, at the time when the latter was proceeding from Mahubah towards Badan. He presented jewelleries and divers valuables of Bengal and a large amount in cash. And for a time remaining in the company of the Sultan, he took permission to return, and came back to Bengal, and for a period ruling over Bengal he engaged in demolishing the temples and in building mosques. After this, he planned an expedition towards the Kingdoms of Khata and Tibbat, with a force of ten or twelve thousand select cavalry through the passes of the north-eastern moun-\n\nor Charitable establishments consisting of Students' Hostels and travellers' Guest-houses, founded cities, and established military outposts at strategic points, and introduced the coinage of money (see Tabaqat, pp. 161 and 149). He laid down embankments, constructed roads and bridges connecting his northern military outposts at Deokot and his southern military outpost at Laknor (perhaps Nager in Birbhum) with his newly-founded capital at Lakhnauti.\n\n1 i.e., 594 A.H. or 1198 A.C. This subordination (during Bakhtiar Khilji and at least two of his immediate successors) was nominal, as Bakhtiar conquered Bengal and Behar on his own account, though he outwardly acknowledged the suzerainty of Delhi.\n\n2 A town and a celebrated hill-fort in Banda district.\n\n3 In the text 'Mahma,' which is evidently a mistake of the copyist.\n\n4 Mahaba is a town about 15 miles from Lucknow city.\n\n5 A town in Jalaun district, North-Western Provinces, on the right bank of the Jamna.\n\n6 On the banks of the river Sot, North-Western Provinces, first conquered by Sayad Sabar Masud Ghazi, nephew of Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, in 1028 A.C., and re-conquered by Qutbu-d-din in 1196 A.C.\n\n7 In Tabaqat-i-Nasiri, p. 152, \"Tibbet and Turkistan.\"\n\nOne can easily imagine what an immense Musalman army Bakhtiar Khilji must have subsequently poured into Bengal from the Upper Western Provinces, to have enabled him to detach 10,000 cavalry for an expedition into Tibbat, without weakening his garrison in the newly conquered Provinces of Bengal and Behar, especially as we read in the Tabaqat (p. 157), that at the same time he sent a detachment under Muhammad Shirin to invade Jajnagar (Orissa). Those who are given to amazement at the present numerical\ntains of Bengal. Guided by one of the Chiefs of Koch, named 'Ali Mich, who had been converted to Muhammadan faith by Muhammad Bakhtiar, he reached towards those mountains. 'Ali Mich led Bakhtiar's forces to a country, the town whereof is called Abardhan, and also Barahmangadi. It is said that this town was founded by Emperor Garshasp. Facing that town, flows a river called Namakdi, which in its depth and breadth, is thrice as much as the river Ganges. Since that river was tumultuous, broad, and deep, and fordable with difficulty, marching along the banks of the river for ten days, he reached a place where existed a large bridge made of stone, and extending over twenty-nine arches, erected by the ancients. It is said that Emperor Garshasp, at the time of invading Hindustan, constructed that bridge, and came to the country of Kamrup. In short,\n\nstrength of Musalman population in Bengal, and are at pains to evolve theories to account for it, might as well bear in mind these elementary facts of history.\n\n1 In Tabaqat-i-Nasiri p. 152 \"Mardhan-Kote\" and \"Bardhan-Kote;\" in Badaoni, p. 58, Vol. I, \"Brahman.\" The ruins of 'Bardhan-Kote' lie north of Bogra close to Gobindgunje, on the Karatya river, not far from Ghoraghat, and this is the place meant according to Professor Blochmann.\n\n2 A King of Turan or Turkistan or Tartary or Scythia; but in Namah-i-Khusruan, p. 7, he is described as the last sovereign of the Peshdadian dynasty of Persia. In Ferishta it is stated that when Garshasp made an incursion into Hindustan from Turkistan, he founded the city of Bardhan.\"\n\n3 In Tabaqat-i-Nasiri p. 152, 'Bagmati' and 'Bakmadi'; in Badaoni, p. 58, Vol. I, \"Brahmanputr\" and \"Brahmkadi.\" The river referred to has been identified by Professor Blochmann to be the Karatya, which formed for a long time the boundary between ancient Muhammadan Bengal and Kamrup.\n\n4 This ten days' march extended northward along the banks of the Karatya and the Teesta, which latter before 1784 flowed west of the Karatya, joined the Atrai, and fell into the Padma, and of all Bengal rivers extended furthest into Tibbat. This march then was along the frontier between ancient Musalman Bengal and the territory of the Rajah of Kamrup. Bakhtiar's Tibbatan expedition must have commenced in the latter part of 605 A.H. (1209 A.C.) or beginning of 606 A.H. (1210 A.C.)\n\n5 This bridge must have been in the neighbourhood of Darjeeling (or Darjeeling) which in those days appears to have been the boundary separating the Meches from the hill-tribes. The author of the Tabaqat-i-Nasiri (Pers. text, p. 152), in this connection, mentions the following three tribes as then inhabiting Northern Bengal, viz., (1) Koch, (2) Mech, and (3) Tharo; vide also Dalton's Ethnology of Bengal.\nMuhammad Bakhtiar sending across his forces by that bridge, and posting two commandants for its protection, planned to advance. The R\u0101jah of K\u0101mr\u016bp, dissuading him from an advance, said that if he (Muhammad Bakhtiar) would postpone his march to Tibbat that year, and next year collecting an adequate force would advance towards it in full strength \"I too would be the pioneer of the Moslem force, and would tighten up the waist of self-sacrifice.\" Muhammad Bakhtiar absolutely unheeding this advice, advanced, and after sixteen days, reached the country of Tibbat. The battle commenced with an attack on a fort which had been built by king Garshasp, and was very strong. Many of the Moslem force tasted the lotion of death, and nothing was gained. And from the people of that place who had been taken prisoners, it was ascertained that at a distance of five farsang from that fort, was a large and populous city. Fifty thousand Mongolian cavalry thirsty for blood and archers were assembled in that city. Every day in the market of that city, nearly a thousand or five hundred Mongolian horses sold, and were sent thence to Lakhnauti. And they said \"you have an impracticable scheme in your head with this small force.\" Muhammad Bakhtiar, becoming apprised of this state of affairs, became ashamed of his plan, and, without attaining his end, retreated. And since the inhabitants of those environs, setting fire to the fodder and food-grains, had removed their chattels to the ambuscades of the rocks, at the time of this retreat, for fifteen days, the soldiers did not see a handful of food-grains, nor did the cattle see one bushel of fodder.\n\n1 In the Tabaqat-i-Nasiri (Pers. text, p. 159), this march is thus related: \"After leaving a Turkish officer and a Khilji officer with a large body of troops to guard the bridge.....Muliammad Bakhtiar Khilji with his army for fifteen days marched across high hills and low defiles, and on the sixteenth day (from his march from the bridge) descended into the open plain of Tibbat, and passed many populous villages......and after some eight hours' hard fighting, entrenched himself in a fort there.\"\n\n2 The Tabaqat-i-Nasiri names the city Karmbatan. Bakhtiar Khilji's march from the bridge was northward for sixteen days.\n\n3 The fair at Nik-mardan, 40 miles north-west of Dinajpur; attracts every year a large number of hill-ponies, which go thence to other places in Bengal and elsewhere.\n\n4 In 16 days Bakhtiar Khilji retreated from the hills of Tibbat into the plains K\u0101mr\u016bp. According to Major Raverty, from the hills of Darjeeling, Bakhtiar Khilji had advanced through Sikkim into Tibbat towards the Sangpa.\nNeither human beings saw any bread except the circular disc of the sun.\nNor did the cattle see any fodder except the rainbow!\n\nFrom excessive hunger the soldiers devoured flesh of horses and horses preferring death to life placed their necks under their daggers. In short, in this straitened condition, they reached the bridge. Since those two commandants quarrelling with each other had deserted their posts at the head of the bridge, the people of that country had destroyed the bridge. At the sight of this destruction, the heart of the high and the low suddenly broke, like the Chinese cup. Muhammad Bakhtiar engulfed in the sea of confusion and perplexity, despaired of every resource. After much striving, he got news that in the neighbourhood there was a very large temple, and that idols of gold and silver were placed there in great pomp. It is said that there was an idol in the temple which weighed a thousand maunds. In short, Muhammad Bakhtiar with his force took refuge in this temple, and was busy improvising means for crossing the river. The Rajah of Kamrup had ordered all his troops and subjects of that country to commit depredations. The people of that country, sending out force after force, engaged in besieging the temple, and from all sides posting in the ground bamboo-made lances, and tying one to the other, turned them into the shape of walls. Muhammad Bakhtiar saw that all chance of escape was slipping out of his hands, and that the knife was reaching the bone, so at once with his force issuing out of the temple and making a sortie, he broke through the stockade of bamboos, and cutting through his way; rescued himself from the hard-pressed siege. The infidels of that country pursued him to the banks of the river, and stretched their hands to plunder and slaughter, so that some by the sharpness of the sword and others by the inundation of water, were engulfed in the sea of destruction. The Musalman soldiers on reaching the river-banks stood perplexed. Suddenly, one of the soldiers plunged with his horse into the river, and went about one arrow-shot, when another soldier seeing this, plunged similarly into the river. As the river had a sandy bed, with a little movement, all\n\n1 Very likely, the temple of Mahumani in Kamrup district.\n2 It would appear that the Rajah of Kamrup who had offered his services to Bakhtiar Khilji, in the end turned out treacherous.\nwere drowned. Only Muhammad Bakhtiar with one thousand cavalry (and according to another account, with three hundred cavalry) succeeded in crossing over;\u00b9 the rest met with a watery grave. After Muhammad Bakhtiar had crossed safely over the tumultuous river with a small force, from excessive rage and humiliation, in that the females and the children of the slaughtered and the drowned from alleys and terraces abused and cursed him, he got an attack of consumption, and reaching Deokot died. And according to other accounts, \u2018Ali Mardan Khilji, who was one of his officers, during that illness, slew Bakhtiar, and raised the standard of sovereignty over the kingdom of Lakhnauti. The period of Malik Ikhtiaru-d-din Muhammad Bakhtiar\u2019s rule over Bengal was twelve years. When Muhammad Bakhtiar passed\n\n\u00b9 For a discussion of the route of Bakhtiar Khilji\u2019s expedition into Tibbat, and of his retreat therefrom, see Raverty\u2019s notes in his translation of Tabagat-i-Nasiri, and Blochmann\u2019s Contributions to History and Geography of Bengal, J.A.S. for 1875, No. 3, Part I, p. 288.\n\nTabagat-i-Nasiri (Pers. printed text, p. 156) states that Bakhtiar Khilji successfully swam across the river with only one hundred troopers, whilst all the rest of his army were drowned.\n\n\u00b2 Deokot or Damdamah, near Gangarampur, south of Dinajpur, was the northern Musalman Military outpost in the time of Bakhtiar Khilji, who had set out for Tibbat either from Deokot or Lakhnauti.\n\n\u00b3 Ali Mardan assassinated Muhammad Bakhtiar Khilji in 606 A.H. (1210 A.C.) at Deokot. This date is arrived at if Bengal was conquered in 594 A.H. or 1198 A.C. by Bakhtiar Khilji, as the best accounts would indicate, and also if he reigned for 12 years over Bengal. Professor Blochmann mentions 602 A.H. as the date of Bakhtiar\u2019s assassination, but he accepts 594 A.H. as the date of the Bengal conquest\u2014which involves chronological contradiction.\n\nMr. Thomas in his \u201cInitial Coinage of Bengal\u201d states that Ali Mardan assumed independence under the title of Alauddin when Qutbuddin Aibak died in Lahore in 607 A.H. Thus allowing 8 months for Malik Azuddin\u2019s rule, Bakhtiar Khilji appears to have been assassinated about the middle of 606 A.H.\u2014the date previously arrived at by me.\n\nIn Badaoni, it is stated that Muhammad Bakhtiar Khilji returned to Deokot from Tibbat with only some three hundred troopers, the rest of his expeditionary force having perished, and fell ill from vexation, and was attacked with hectic fever, and used to say \u201cno doubt Sulj\u00e2n Muhammad Muizuddin has met with an accident, that fortune has gone so against me.\u201d And when he became weak from illness, Ali Murdan, one of Muhammad Bakhtiar\u2019s principal officers, arrived at Deokot, and finding him bed-ridden, pulled down the sheet from his face, and despatched\nfrom the rule of this transitory world into the eternal world, Malik\u00b9 \u2018Azu-d-din Khilji succeeded to the rule over Bengal. Eight months had not passed, when \u2018Ali Mard\u0101n Khilji slew him.\n\nRULE OF \u2018ALI MARD\u0100N KHILJI IN BENGAL.\n\nAfter the assassination of \u2018Azz-ud-din, his assassin, \u2018Ali Mard\u0101n Khilji became ruler of Bengal, styled himself Sult\u0101n \u2018Al\u0101n-d-din,\n\nhim with one blow of a dagger. The above account is rendered thus by the Tabaqat-i-Ni\u1e63iri, the nearest contemporary account, (Pers. text, l p. 156):\u2014When Bakhtiar Khilji with about one hundred troopers only made good his escape across the river, \u2018Ali Mich with his relatives rendered good services, and conducted Bakhtiar Khilji towards Deokot. On arrival at Deokot, from excessive humiliation Bakhtiar fell ill and shut himself up, and did not ride out in the streets, for whenever he did so, widows and orphans of the soldiers and officers that had fallen, used to curse and abuse him from the terraces and the streets. Bakhtiar would say \u201cSome mishap must have befallen Sultan Muizuddin, for the tide of fortune to have thus turned against me.\u201d And it was a fact, for at that time Sultan Muizuddin had fallen at the hands of an assassin (a Ghakkar). From excessive humiliation, Muhammad Bakhtiar Khilji fell ill and was confined to his bed, and at length died. And according to another account, one of his officers \u2018Ali Mard\u0101n Khilji who was bold and ferocious, and held the fief of Deokot, on hearing the news of Bakhtiar\u2019s illness, came to Deokot, found him lying in bed, threw aside the sheet from his face, and slew him.\u201d\n\n\u00b9 His name was Malik \u2018Azuddin Muhammad Shir\u0101n Khilji (Tabaqat-i-Na\u1e63iri, Pers. text p. 157). The following account of him is summarised from Tabaqat, the nearest contemporary account: \u201cMuhammad Shir\u0101n and Ahmad Iran were two brothers, both being Khilji noblemen, and in the service of Bakhtiar. When Bakhtiar led his expedition towards Tibbat, he sent the above two brothers with an army towards Lakhnaut\u012b and Jajnagar (Orissa). When these heard the news of Bakhtiar\u2019s assassination, they returned to Deokot, and after performing funeral ceremonies, proceeded towards Narkot\u012b (not identified, but must have lain not far from Deokot) which was held in fief by \u2018Ali Mard\u0101n Khilji. They captured the latter, and placed him in charge of the Kotwal (the police commissioner) of that place, named Baba Kotwal Ispahani, and returned to Deokot. Muhammad Shir\u0101n was an energetic man endowed with noble qualities. At the conquest of Nudesh, he had rendered good service by capturing elephants. As he was head of the Khilji oligarchy, all the Khilji nobles acknowledged him as their chief and paid homage to him. In the meantime, Ali Mard\u0101n Khilji made good his escape, proceeded to Delhi, and persuaded Sultan Qutbuddin to depute from Oundh Qaimas R\u016bmi to Lakhnaut\u012b, in order to put down the Khilji oligarchy in Bengal. Hussamuddin Iwaz who held the fief of Kanktor\u012b (Kangor, near\nand introduced the Khutbah and the coin in his own name. The breeze of insolence and vanity blew into the recesses of his brain, and he commenced oppressions and innovations. Two years he continued to rule, at length when the Imperial army from Delhi arrived, all the Khiljis making a common cause with the Imperial army avenged the murder of \u2018Azu-d-din. After this, the rule of this kingdom passed to Ghi\u0101su-d-din Khilji.\n\nRULE OF GHI\u0100SU-D-D\u012aN KHILJ\u012a IN BENGAL.\n\nGhi\u0101su-d-din Khilji succeeded to the rule of Bengal. In that year 607 A.H., Sult\u0101n Qutb\u016b-d-d\u012bn, whilst playing at polo at Deokot) from Bakhtiar Khilji, went ahead to receive Qaimaz R\u016bm\u012b, and in the latter\u2019s company proceeded to Deokot, and on the initiative of Qaimaz, received the fief of Deokot. When Qaimaz was returning from Deokot, Muhammad Shir\u0101n and other Khilji nobles collected together, and attempted to re-take Deokot. Qaimaz came back, fought with the Khilji nobility and Muhammad Shir\u0101n, who being defeated, dispersed, quarrelled amongst themselves near Makidah (Masidah, a parganah south-east of Deokot) and Mantosh (Santosh, a parganah south-east of Deokot), and Muhammad Shir\u0101n was slain. He lies buried at Santosh (on the banks of the Atrai river).\n\n1 \u2018Ali Mard\u0101n Khilji, assassin of Bakhtiar Khilji and Azuddin Khilji, ruled from 607 A.H. to 609 or 610 A.H. and assumed independence and title of Sult\u0101n \u2018Alauddin, on the death of Qutb\u016b-d-d\u012bn Aibak. In Tabaqat-i-Nasiri it is stated that he recited the Khutbah; but Badaoni states that he minted also coins in his own name. [I have not yet seen any of his coins. Mr. Thomas in his \u2018Initial Coinage of Bengal\u2019 notices the coins of Abauddin\u2019s successor, Ghiasuddin, struck in A.H. 616, see J.A.S., p. 354, p. 1, Vol. XLII for 1873]. It is also stated in Tabaqat-i-Nasiri (Pers. text, p. 159), that from excessive insolence, he divided the country of Ir\u0101n and Tur\u0101n amongst his adherents, and no one dared to suggest that those dominions did not pertain to him. One person complained of poverty to Alauddin, who enquired whence he came. On learning he came from Ispahan, he ordered his ministers to write out a document assigning lands in Ispahan to him!\n\nIt is stated in Tabaqat, that on escape from the custody of the Kotwal of Narkoti, Ali Mard\u0101n went to Sult\u0101n Qutb\u016b-d-d\u012bn, and received the Vice-royalty of Lakhnauti. When he crossed the Kosi river, Hussamuddin from Deokot received him, conducted him to Deokot, where Ali Mard\u0101n was formally installed in power. He was cruel and ferocious, killed many Khilji nobles, and the native chieftains trembled under him. The subjects as well as the soldiers were in disgust with him.\n\nHis real name was Hussamuddin Iwas-bia Al-Hussain. He was a noble of Khilji and Garmsir, and on joining Bakhtiar Khilji was first ap-\nLahor, fell from his horse, and died, and his son, Aram Shah, mounted the throne of Delhi, and the Empire fell into decay. Ghiyasuddin establishing completely his rule over this province, pointed to fief of Kangor, (which lay south-east of Deokot) and next promoted to charge of the important northern military outpost of Deokot. On the appointment of Ali Mardan Khilji to the rule of Bengal, he advanced to receive the new Viceroy on the banks of the Kosi river, and helped in the latter's installation at Deokot. On the assassination by the Khilji nobles of Ali Mardan, who had since the death of Emperor Qutbuddin Aibak assumed independence, Hussamuddin was elected chief of the Khilji oligarchy in Bengal in 609 or 610 A.H. Seeing the feebleness of Qutbuddin's successor, Aram Shah, Hussamuddin assumed independence, made Lakhnauti his capital, and assumed the title of Sultan Ghiyasuddin about 612 A.H., and minted coins in his own name.\n\nMr. Thomas in his \"Initial Coinage of Bengal\" notices several coins of Sultan Ghiyasuddin struck at Gaur or Lakhnauti between 614 and 630 A.H. An examination of these coins indicates the interesting and curious fact that Ghiyasuddin had put himself in communication with the Khalifa of Baghdad so far back as 620 A.H. (that is, earlier than Emperor Altamsh of Delhi who obtained similar honour in 626 A.H.) and obtained a pontifical patent, recognizing the sovereign of Bengal amongst the Moslem hierarchy of the world. This circumstance, as suggested by Mr. Thomas, would also indicate that in those days there was freer sea and ocean-intercourse between the Musalmans along the shores of Bengal and the Arabs of the sea-ports of Basrah and Baghdad, than between Musalmans of more inland places in India and the Arabs of the aforesaid sea-ports.\n\nIn 622 A.H., Emperor Altamsh from Delhi invaded Bengal, and on Sultan Ghiyasuddin paying him tribute, peace was concluded. In 624 A.H. Sultan Nasiruddin, eldest son of Emperor Altamsh, invaded Lakhnauti, whilst Ghiyasuddin was engaged at Kamrup and Bang (East Bengal), and fought a battle with Sultan Ghiyasuddin, on the latter's return, and killed the latter, and succeeded to the rule over Bengal in a semi-sovereign capacity, with the approval of his father, Emperor Altamsh. It is stated that Sultan Ghiyasuddin extended and consolidated the Moslem sovereignty in Bengal, and extended his empire over Jajnagar (Orissa), Bang (East Bengal), Kamrud (or Kamrup, Western Assam), and Tirtha (see Tabaqat-i-Nasiri, Pers. text, p. 163.) Minhajus-Siraj, Author of Tabaqat-i-Nasiri who visited Lakhnauti shortly after in 641 A.H. and appreciated the material improvements effected by Ghiyasuddin, pays him a high tribute (Pers. text, p. 161), a tribute which in 627 A.H. Emperor Altamsh had also paid to the memory of this good and great sovereign, by decreeing that Ghiyasuddin should in his grave be styled as a Sultan. Amongst his public works, Tabaqat-i-Nasiri mentions that he founded the Fort of Baskot (Basankot near Gaur), established mosques, and Public Halls, &c.\nintroduced the Khutbah and the coin in his own name, and to some extent arrogating to himself the sovereign power, he ruled over this country. And when the throne of Delhi by the accession of Sultan Shamsu-d-din Altamsh received eclat in the year 622 A.H., the latter marched with his forces to Behar, and invaded Lakhnauti. Sultan Ghiyasu-d-din not finding strength in himself to stand an encounter, presented to the Emperor thirty-eight elephants, eighty thousand rupees, together with various valuables and other presents, and enlisted himself amongst the adherents of the Emperor. Sultan Shamsu-d-din Altamsh introducing there the Khutbah and the coin in his own name and bestowing on his eldest son the title of Sultan Nasiru-d-din, and entrusting to him the rule over the kingdom of Lakhnauti, and presenting to him the royal umbrella and staff, himself returned to the metropolis of Delhi. Sultan Ghiyasu-d-din was just and liberal, and the period of his rule was twelve years.\n\n---\n\nRULE OF SULTAN NASIRU-D-DIN, SON OF SULTAN SHAMSU-D-DIN ALTAMSH, EMPEROR OF DELHI.\n\nSultan Nasiru-d-din succeeded to the rule of Bengal. After the return of Sultan Shamsu-d-din Altamsh towards Delhi, Ghiyasu-d-din who had gone towards the kingdom of Kamrup, returning, raised the standard of revolt. Sultan Nasiru-d-din killed him after a bloody engagement, and obtaining much booty, sent many valuables and presents of this country to many of his acquaintances at Delhi, and for three years and some months he continued to rule over Bengal. In the year 626 A.H., at Lakhnauti, he tasted the untasty lotion of death.\u00b9 And Hussamu-d-din Khilji\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 His body was brought to Delhi, and enshrined by the loving father in a beantiful mausoleum (known as the mausoleum of Sultan Ghazi), about three miles west of the celebrated Qutb Minar. In the inscription on the mausoleum, Nasiruddin is entitled \u201cEmperor of the East,\u201d or \u201cMalik-ul-Maluk-ul-Sharq.\u201d Emperor Altamsh so much loved the memory of his eldest son (the King of Bengal) that he bestowed his name (i.e., Nasiruddin) on his (Emperor\u2019s) younger son who afterwards mounted the throne of Delhi, after whom Tabaqat-i-Nasiri is named.\n\n\u00b2 In Tabaqat-i-Nasiri, \u201cBalka Malik Khilji.\u201d The correct name appears to be Malik Ikhtiaruddin Balka, who assumed the title of Doulat Shah, and minted coins. Mr. Thomas in his \u201cInitial Coinage of Bengal\u201d notices\nwho was one of the nobles of Md. Bakhtiar succeeded to the rule of Bengal.\n\nRULE OF 'AL\u0100U-D-D\u012aN KH\u0100N.\n\nWhen Sultan Shamsu-d-din Altamsh heard the news of the death of his beloved son, he observed the necessary ceremonies of mourning, and in the year 627 A.H. for the purpose of quenching the fire of insurrection which had appeared in Bengal after the death of Nasiru-d-din, proceeded to Lakhnati, and after fighting with Malik Hussamu-d-din Khilji, who raising insurrection had brought about complete disorder in the government of Bengal, captured him. After weeding out the root of insurrection, and quelling the tumult of rebellion, he assigned the rule of that kingdom to Izzul-mulk Malik 'Alau-d-din Khan. And the latter devoting himself to the subjugation and administration of the country enforced in this country the Imperial Khutbah and coin. After ruling three years, he was recalled.\n\nRULE OF SAIFU-D-D\u012aN TURK.\n\nAfter supercession of Izzu-l-mulk 'Alau-d-din, Saifu-d-din Turk received the Royal patent of Viceroyalty of Bengal. He,\n\na coin of Doulat Shah struck in 627 A.H. To put down Doulat Shah, Emperor Altamsh personally invaded Bengal for the second time in 627 A.H., defeated Doulat Shah or Ikhtiaruddin Balka, and entrusted the government of Bengal to Alauddin Khan or Alauddin Jani. (Tabaqat-i-Nasiri, Pers. text, p. 174).\n\n1 In Badoni, \"Malik Alauddin Khafi,\" in Tabaqat-i-Nasiri \"Alauddin Jani.\" After his first invasion of Bengal, in 622 A.H., Sultan Shamsuddin Altamsh separated Behar from Bengal, which was under Sultan Ghiasuddin, and left Alauddin Jani as its Governor. On Altamsh's withdrawal, Sultan Ghiasuddin wrested Behar again from Alauddin Jani, and hence the second invasion of Bengal by Emperor Altamsh's son.\n\n2 The following account of him is abridged by me from Tabaqat-i-Nasiri, the nearest contemporary account (Pers. text, p. 238):\u2014 \"Malik Saifuddin Aibak Ighantat was a Turk of Khata; he was a noble Malik, and was endowed with excellent qualities. Sultan Nasiruddin Mahmud, King of Bengal, (son of Emperor Altamsh), purchased him, and kept him in his company, first appointing him as Amir-ul-Majlis (Lord Chamberlain) and then conferring on him the sief of Sarsati. Subsequently, for his good services, he was appointed Governor of Rehar, and next promoted to the\ntoo, occupied the Viceregal throne for three years, when he died of poison.\n\nRULE OF IZZU-D-DIN TUGHAN KHAN.\u00b9\n\nSince the juggling sky at that time had thrown the reins of Viceroyalty of Bengal (Lakhnauti), when Alauddin Jaai, the Bengal Viceroy, was recalled. He captured several elephants in Vilayet-i-Bang (East Bengal), sent them as presents to the Delhi Emperor (Shamsuddin Altamsh) and received the title of Ighantat.\n\n\u00b9 The following account of him is summarised by me from Tabaqat-i-Nasiri, the nearest contemporary account (Pers. text, p. 242);\u2014Malik Tughan Khan Turki was comely in appearance, and noble in heart. He hailed from Khata. He was liberal and generous, endowed with noble qualities; in liberality and generosity, and in conciliating and winning over people, he had no match in the army. When the Sultan (Emperor Altamsh) purchased him, he first became the Royal cup-bearer, next he was appointed Secretary and Keeper of the Imperial Seal (Dawat Dar). He lost the Imperial jewelled ink-pot, and was degraded to the office of Ghashnigir (a taster to a prince), and after a long time, was appointed Superintendent of the Imperial stables (Amir-i-Akbar); and after some time, was appointed feudatory of Badaon, and next appointed Governor of Behar, when Lakhnauti (Bengal) was conferred on Ighantat Saifuddin Aibak. At length when Saifuddin died, Tughan Khan was appointed to the vacant Bengal (Lakhnauti) Viceroyalty. After the death of Sultan Nasiruddin Mahmud (son of Emperor Altamsh, and Viceroy of Bengal), between Tughan Khan and the feudatory of Lakhnauti named Lakor Aibak, who enjoyed the title of Aur Khan, ill-feeling broke out. Tughan Khan fought with Lakor Aibak before the fort of Basankot, close to Lakhnauti, defeated and killed the latter, and subdued both wings of Lakhnauti, one being in Badh on the side of Lakor (probably Nagor) and the other being in Barand, on the side of Deokot. At this time, Empress Razia ascended the Imperial throne of Delhi, and Tughan Khan sent envoys with presents to Delhi, and received in return Imperial presents sent in charge of Qazi Jalaluddin. Tughan proceeded from Lakhnauti to Tirhat district, and acquired much booty and treasure. When Sultan Muizuddin Bahram Shah ascended the Imperial throne of Delhi, Tughan Khan sent the former also presents. When Sultan Alauddin succeeded Bahram Shah, Bahsuddin Hullal Sudani invaded Oadh, Manikpur, and Karah and cast eyes on the eastern provinces, and so Tughan Khan went to Karah and Manikpur, (to conciliate Behanddin and to turn him back), and in Oadh met Minhajul-Siraj, (author of Tabaqat-i-Nasiri), and with the latter went back to Lakhnauti in 641 A.H. At this time the Rajah of Jajnagar (Orissa) committed depredations in Lakhnauti. Tughan Khan that year, by way of reprisal, invaded Jajnagar (Minhajul-Siraj accompanying him) and reached and stormed the fort of Baktasan,\nthe empire of Delhi into the hands of Sultan Razia, daughter of Sultan Shamsu-d-din Altamsh, during her reign, the Viceroyalty which is on the Orissa frontier. Fighting ensued, and the Musalmans were defeated. Tughan Khan returned to Lakhnauti, sent Sharfu-l-mulk Ashari to the Emperor of Delhi, to seek for help. Under Emperor's order, a large army led by Tamar Kh\u00fcn Qamruddin Qiran, feudatory of Oudh, was sent to Lakhnauti, in order to repel and chastise the infidels of Jajnagar (Orissa). The Rajah of Jajnagar invaded Lakhnauti, owing to Musalmans in the previous expedition having demolished the Orissa fort of Katasan (or Baktasan). The Orissans first took Lakor (probably Nager), and slaughtered a large body of Musalmans including the Commandant of Lakor, named Fakhrul Mulk Karimuddin, and then approached the gate of Lakhnauti, but after fighting retreated. Then between Tughan Khan and Tamar Khan ill-feeling ensued, and they fought against each other, and on both sides many were killed. By the intercession of Minhaju-s-Siraj (author of Tabaqat-i-Nasiri) peace was brought about between the two, on condition that Lakhnauti would be left to Tamar Khan, and Tughan Khan with his treasures and elephants and effects would retire to Delhi. Tughan did so (in his company being Minhaju-s-Siraj); the Emperor loaded him with presents, bestowed on him the Governorship of Oudh, whilst Tamar Khan held the Bengal Viceroyalty. On the same night, both died, Tamar Khan at Lakhnauti, and Tughan in Oudh!\n\nIt would appear from the above that the invasion of Bengal by Mughals under Changiz Khan referred to in the text, is a myth and a mistake for the invasion of Lakhnauti by the Hindus of Jajnagar (Orissa). The mistake is repeated in many histories, but Tabaqat's account is the most reliable, as its author was an eye-witness of the affair.\n\n1 The daughter of Emperor Altamsh, named Razia, ascended the throne of Delhi in accordance with her father's wishes in 634 A.H. (1236 A.C.) The sight of an unveiled Moslem Empress seated on the Imperial throne of Delhi, struck all Indo-Moslem eyes in those days as a curious phenomenon, and hence our author's expression, \"Juggling sky.\" She reigned for three years from 1236 A.C. to 1239 A.C. According to Badaoni, the Empress was endowed with excellent qualities, and was brave, generous and intelligent. She followed the path of equity and the principles of justice, and set in order the affairs which had remained in confusion during the brief reign of her step-brother Sultan Ruknuddin Firuz Shah. She set before her the pursuit of beneficence as the object of her ambition, and made Nizamul Janaidi, Chief Vizier. The Empress came out of the curtain, wore masculine garments, such as a tunic and a Kullah, and sat on the throne. According to Tabaqat-i-Nasiri, she was put to death by the Hindus. She was learned in the Qoran, industrious in public business, firm and energetic in every crisis. Indeed, she was a great woman and a great Queen.\nof Lakhnauti was bestowed on Izzu-d-din Tughan Khan. The latter devoted himself to the administration of the country, and for a period was successful. When in the year 639 A.H. Sultan Alau-d-din Masud ascended the throne of Delhi, Tughan Khan sent many presents and valuables to the Emperor of Dehli in charge of Sharfu-l-Mulk Sanqari, and the Emperor sent to Izzu-d-din Tughan Khan in charge of Qazi Jalalu-d-din, Governor of Oudh, a ruby-laid umbrella and a special robe of honour. And in the year 642 A.H., thirty thousand Mughal soldiers of Changiz Khan, making an incursion into the kingdom of Lakhnauti through the passes of the northern mountains, created much confusion. Malik Izzu-d-din sent an account of this to Sultan Alau-d-din. On hearing of this, the Emperor despatched to Lakhnauti a large force under Malik Qurabeg Tamar Khan, who was one of the servants of Khwajah Tash, for assisting Tughan Khan. At the time of engagement, the Mughal forces not being able to give battle returned to their country, vanquished. In the meantime, on certain occasions between Izzu-d-din Tughan Khan and Malik Qurabeg Tamar Khan, dissension set in; consequently, Sultan Alau-d-din, in accordance with the saying \"Two rulers cannot rule over one country,\" appointed Malik Qurabeg Tamar Khan to be ruler of Lakhnauti, and recalled to Dehli Malik Izzu-d-din Tughan Khan. Tughan Khan ruled for 13 years and some months.\n\nRULE OF MALIK QURABEG TAMAR KHAN.\n\nAfter supercession of Malik Izzu-d-din Tughan Khan, Qurabeg Tamar Khan, becoming ruler of the kingdom of Lakhnauti, set\n\n---\n\n1 Malik Qurabeg Tamar Khan or Qamru-d-din Qiran Tamar Khan was Governor of Bengal from 642 A.H. to 644 A.H., when he died.\n\nAn account of his career in Bengal already appears in a previous note. His previous career may, however, be noticed here. I summarise it from Tabaqat-i-Nasiri (Pers. text, p. 247), which is a contemporary account:\u2014\n\n\"Mallik Tamar Khan Turk was virtuous and polished in manners, very energetic and generous and active and brave. He had a handsome appearance. Sultan Shamsu-d-din Altamsh purchased him for 50,000 chital, appointed him Deputy Superintendent of the Royal Stables, whilst Tughan Khan was the Chief Superintendent. In the reign of Empress Razia, he became feudatory of Kananj, and fought in the expedition against Kahwar and Malwa, and rendered good services. He received fief of Karah, and also did good...\"\nhimself to administrative affairs. After ruling ten years, he died. And in the reign of Emperor Nasiru-d-din Mahmud, son of Sultan Shamsu-d-din Altamsh in the year 655 H. the Viceroyalty of Lakhnauti was entrusted to Malik Jalalu-d-din Khan.\n\nRULE OF MALIK JALALU-D-DIN KHAN:\n\nWhen Malik Jalalu-d-din Khan succeeded to the Viceroyalty of the kingdom of Lakhnauti, he ruled over it for a year more or less, and in the year 656 A.H. he was superceded, and Arsalan Khan was appointed Viceroy of that province.\n\nRULE OF ARSALAN KHAN:\n\nWhen Arsalan Khan became Viceroy of Lakhnauti, he devoted himself to administrative matters. He asserted some amount of independence. In the year 657 A.H., he sent two elephants and much jewellery and rare stuffs to Sultan Nasiru-d-din, and shortly after died at Lakhnauti.\n\nservice there. On the death of Nasiru-d-din, he was appointed Governor of Oudh. Whilst at Oudh, he invaded all the eastern tracts including Tirhut, and carried off immense booty. He was thence sent to Lakhnauti to help Tughan Khan in repelling the Ooriya invasion, and after that settled down in Bengal as its Viceroy.\n\n1 After him the Tabaqat-i-Nasiri is named; it is a general history of India from the commencement of Musalman Rule down to 658 A.H. (1260 A.C.) Sultan Nasiru-d-din succeeded Sultan Alan-d-din to the throne of Delhi in 1246 A.C. His Visier was Ghiasu-d-din Balban (afterwards Emperor Balban). Of the six years which intervened between 658 A.H. and 664 A.H. (the date of assumption of sovereignty by Emperor Balban) there is no known historical work. The Tarikh Firuz Shahi of Zian-d-din Barni only began from Ghiasu-d-din Balban's reign. Emperor Balban reigned from 1265 to 1287 A.C.\n\n2 Jalaluddin Masud, Malik Jani Khilji Khan, became Governor of Bengal in 656 A.H.\n\nI do not find any detailed account of him given in the Tabaqat-i-Nasiri.\n\n3 Izzu-d-din Balban was Governor of Bengal in 657 A.H., in which year he was attacked by Taju-d-din Arsalan Khan Sanjar-i-Kharizmi, who was subsequently captured or killed at Lakhnauti by Izzu-d-din. Hence Taju-d-din Arsalan Khan cannot count amongst Governors of Bengal (see Blochmann's Contr. to Hist. and Geog. of Bengal, and Tabaqat-i-Nasiri, Pers. text, p. 267).\nRULE OF MUHAMMAD T\u0100T\u0100R KH\u0100N.\n\nAfter the death of Arsalan Kh\u0101n, his son, Md. T\u0101t\u0101r Kh\u0101n, who was illustrious for his bravery, liberality, heroism and honesty, becoming independent in his rule of Lakhnauti, did not much bend his head in submission to Emperor N\u0101\u1e63iru-d-din. And after a while, he had the Khu\u1e6dbah in the kingdom of Lakhnauti recited in his own name, and for some time he passed in this wise. And when in the year 664 A.H. the throne of Dehli received eclat from the accession of Sult\u0101n Ghi\u0101\u1e63u-d-din Balban, and the fame of high aspiration and steadiness and high ambition of that Emperor spread to all sides, Md. T\u0101t\u0101r Kh\u0101n, using foresight, sent sixty-three head of elephants, together with other presents, to Dehli. As this was the first year of his accession, Sult\u0101n Ghi\u0101\u1e63u-d-din Balban considering this an auspicious augury, illuminated the City with lamps, and the nobles, feudatories and the principal officers presenting nazar became recipients of gifts. And the envoys of Muhammad T\u0101t\u0101r Kh\u0101n, after being loaded with presents, got permission to return. T\u0101t\u0101r Kh\u0101n pleased with the Imperial gifts, submitted and enrolled himself in the ranks of the Emperor's Omara. Sult\u0101n Ghi\u0101\u1e63u-d-din Balban appointed a Turkish slave named Tughral to the Viceroyalty of Lakhnauti.\n\n1 Muhammad Arsalan T\u0101t\u0101r Kh\u0101n, son of Arsalan Kh\u0101n Sanjar, had been for some time Governor of Bengal, when the Emperor Balban ascended the throne (664 A.H.) (See Tarikh Firuz Shahi, by Ziau-d-din Barni, Pers. text, pp. 53 and 66.) He was generous, liberal and brave. After a few years he was succeeded by Tughral, who proclaimed himself king, under the title of Sult\u0101n Mughisun-d-din.\n\n2 This account differs slightly from Professor Blochmann's conclusions derived from inscriptions and the evidence of coins, as set forth in his Contributions to the History and Geography of Bengal. Professor Blochmann holds that on the death of Muhammad T\u0101t\u0101r Kh\u0101n, which took place shortly after Balban's accession, Sher Kh\u0101n was appointed Imperial Governor of Lakhnauti; that Sher Kh\u0101n was succeeded in the office by Amin Kh\u0101n, whose Deputy or Naib was Tughral. Tughral heard of Balban's illness, attacked and defeated Amin Kh\u0101n, and proclaimed himself king of Bengal under the title of Sult\u0101n Mughisun-d-din (A.C. 1279). Balban recovered from his illness shortly after, invaded Bengal in person, defeated Tughral, at some place near Sunargaon, where Danuj Rai was the zemindar (Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi, p. 87), and in 681 H. (A.C. 1282) before leaving Bengal conferred the throne of Bengal on his (the Emperor Balban's) son, Bughra Kh\u0101n, who assumed the title of Sult\u0101n Nasiru-d-din. N\u0101\u1e63iru-d-din appears to have died in 691 H. (1292 A.C.), that is about five years after the death of his\nRULE OF TUGHRAL, STYLED SULTAN MUGHISU-D-DIN.\n\nTughral became Viceroy of Lakhnauti. In that, in liberality and bravery, courage and sagacity he was unequalled, in a short time he brought the kingdom of Lakhnauti to subjection and order, and subjugated Kamrup (Western Assam). In the year 678 A.H. he marched with his forces from Lakhnauti to Jajnagar, and vanquishing the Rajah of that place, obtained many elephants and much riches and chattels and stuffs. In that Sultan Ghiasu-d-din Balban had become old, and both of his sons were at Multan with large forces engaged in fighting the Mughals, the kingdom of Lakhnauti was lost sight of. In consequence of this circumstance, Tughral failed to despatch elephants and booty to the Emperor. And also as at the time the Emperor was sick at Delhi, and had not come out of the palace for one month, and rumours of his death had spread in the Empire, Tughral finding the field completely open, sallied out, and collecting a large force proclaimed himself Sultan Mughisu-d-din, and unfurling on his head the red Royal umbrella, had the Khutbah in that country recited after his own name. Simultaneously with this event, the Emperor recovered health, and royal edicts announcing the recovery were received. Tughral, not becoming ashamed of what he had done, struck the hand of disloyalty on the hem of hostility. When Sultan Ghiasu-d-din Balban became aware of this, he despatched Malik Abtakin who had long hairs, and who had the title of Amin Khan and was Governor of Oudh, appointing him generalissimo illustrious father Emperor Balban. For a full account of Tughral styled Sultan Mughisu-d-din, see Tabaqat-i-Nasiri (Pers. text, p. 261), and also Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi (Pers. text, pp. 81 to 94), by Ziau-d-din Barni. Before becoming Governor of Bengal, he held the following offices: Chashnigir (Taster to a prince) under Shamsu-d-din Altamsh; Amir-ul Majlis or Lord Chamberlain under Emperor Ruknu-d-din, Superintendent of Elephants, next Superintendent of Stables under Empress Baziah, feudatory of Tabarhind under Sultan Alan-d-din, next feudatory of Kanauj and Governor of Oudh, and next Viceroy of Bengal. He invaded Jajnagar (Orissa), Oudh and Kamrup (Western Assam) successfully, and then proclaimed his independence. Tughral was active and energetic, bold and courageous, liberal and generous. It is worthy of note that in this connection, the author of Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi (p. 93), for the first time uses expressions like these, \"Iqlim-i-Lakhnauti,\" \"Iqlim-i-Sunargaon,\" \"Arshah-i-Bangalai,\"\u2014indicating that Tughral had considerably extended his Bengal Satrapy.\nof the expedition, and also Viceroy of Lakhnauti, together with other nobles, such as Tamar Kh\u0101n Shamsi, Malik Taj\u016b-d-din, son of \u2018Ali Kh\u0101n,\u00b9 and Jam\u0101lu-d-din Qandah\u0101r\u012b, for destroying Tughral. And when Malik Abtakin with a large force crossed the river Sro, and marched towards Lakhnauti, Tughral, too, with a large force came to encounter him. In that, in bravery and generosity, he was matchless, some nobles and soldiers deserting Amin Kh\u0101n joined Tughral, so that on the day of engagement the force of Amin Kh\u0101n was routed. And when Amin Kh\u0101n being vanquished retreated to Oudh, the Emperor hearing of this became anxious and perplexed, ordered that Amin Kh\u0101n should be hanged at the gate of Oudh, and afterwards appointed Malik Tarmini with a large force for destroying Tughral. And Tughral making a bold attack vanquished this force also, and obtained much booty.\n\nOwing to strength of fortune,\nthat rampant lion,\nTwice routed the army of the enemy.\n\nSult\u0101n Ghiasu-d-din, on hearing this bad news, became dejected and anxious, and made kingly efforts, and boldly resolved to march out himself, and ordered that numerous boats should be kept ready in the rivers Jon and Ganges, and he himself on the pretext of a hunting excursion went towards San\u0101m and Sam\u0101nah. Appointing Malik S\u016bnaj to be governor of Sam\u0101nah, he took his young son, Bughr\u0101 Kh\u0101n, with a select force in his own company, and passed from Sam\u0101nah to Do\u0101b. Leaving Maliku-l-Umara-Fakhru-d-din Kotulal to rule as Viceroy at-Dehli in his absence, he crossed the Ganges, and not heeding that it was the rainy season, by forced marches, proceeded towards Lakhnauti. Tughral who in this interval had collected his efficient troops, marched in state towards J\u0101jnagar with his treasures and a large army, and planned to take it and to encamp there, and subsequently to return to Lakhnauti, when the Emperor would return to Dehli. But when the Emperor reached Lakhnauti, after staying there a few days, he despatched General Hass\u0101mu-d-din Vakil-dar B\u0101rbag (Secretary of State), who was the grandfather of the author of the T\u0101rikh-i-Firuz Shah\u012b, to subjngate the\n\n\u00b9 In Tarikh-i-Firuz Shah\u012b, \u201cQutlugh Kh\u0101n Shamsi.\u201d\nkingdom of Lakhnati, and the Emperor himself marched towards Jaunagar,\u00b9 to chastise Tughral. At the time, when the Emperor reached the confines of Sunargaon, Bhuj Rai,\u00b2 who was the Zamin-dar of that place, enrolled himself in the ranks of the Imperial adherents, and promised that in case Tughral attempted to escape across the river,\u00b3 he would prevent his doing so. But when the Emperor swiftly passing from that place marched several stages, the trace of Tughral was lost, and no one could give a clue to his whereabouts. The Emperor ordered Malik Barak Baras\u2074 that he should march ahead ten or twelve Karoh with seven thousand chosen cavalry. Although these tried every means of pursuit and search, they could obtain no trace of Tughral. One day, Malik Muhammad Tirandaz,\u2075 the ruler of Koel,\u2076 and his brother, Malik Muqaddar, separating themselves from the vanguard force, with thirty or forty troopers marched ahead. Suddenly, on a field they came across some grocers. Arresting these, they made enquiries, and in order to frighten them, they commenced slaughter by breaking the neck of one; then the others cried out:\u2014\"If your object is to obtain goods and provisions, whatever we have, you may take; but spare our lives.\" Malik Muhammad Tirandaz said: \"We have no concern with your goods and stores: our object is to ascertain the whereabouts of Tughral. If you show the way, your lives and things would be spared; otherwise whatever will befall you, will be the consequence of your misconduct.\" The grocers said: \"We carried food-grains to the camp of Tughral,\" and now\n\n\u00b9 From the manner of description given here, the Jaunagar here referred to would seem not to be in Orissa, but some place in East Bengal (probably Tipperah). For an exhaustive and interesting discussion on \"Jaunagar,\" see Blochmann's \"Contributions to History and Geography of Bengal.\"\n\n\u00b2 In Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi, \"Danuj Rai,\" (p. 87).\n\n\u00b3 Probably the river Brahmaputra or Megna is meant. Sunarg\u0101on is situate on the banks of the Brahmaputra, 13 miles S.-E. of Dacca. For a contemporary and graphic description of Emperor Ghiasu-d-din Balban's expedition to Bengal, see Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi (pp. 85-94 Pers. text.)\n\n\u2074 In Ferishta, \"Barbaq Barlas,\" in Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi \"Barik Begtaras.\"\n\n\u2075 In Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi. (\"Malik Muhammad Sherandaz,\" p. 88).\n\n\u2076 Koel is a tehsil in Aligarh District.\n\n\u2077 From the description given, Tughral alias Sultan Mughisu-d-din would appear to have pitched his tent at the time on the western banks of the Brahmaputra not very far from Sunargaon. Or, one might imagine him at this point of time having shifted his tent further eastward to the western bank of the Megna, opposite perhaps to the old ferry of Manioknagar.\nwe are returning from there. Between you and Tughral, there is a distance of half a farsakh. To-day he is encamping there; tomorrow he will march to J\u0101jnagar.\" Malik Muhammad Tirand\u0101z sent the grocers with two troopers to Malik B\u0101rbak Baras, and sent word that after ascertaining the truth from the grocers, he should march up swiftly, so that Tughral might not march to the Vil\u0101yet of J\u0101jnagar which is in the kingdom of Bengal, and leaguing with the people of that part, might not hide himself in a jungle. And he himself with troopers went forward, and saw the tent of Tughral, and his army resting in false security, and his elephants and horses grazing about. Availing himself of the opportunity, he rushed with his cavalry towards the camp of Tughral. No one opposed their progress, fancying that they were officers attached to the army of Tughral. When they arrived in front of Tughral's tent, all of a sudden drawing their swords, they killed every one they found in the Audience-Hall, and shouted out that the kingdom of Bengal pertained to the Empire of Balban. Tughral fancied that the Emperor had himself arrived. Becoming totally confounded, he slipped out in great perplexity by the bath-room door, and mounting an unsaddled horse, and not mustering his own adherents, owing to great confusion of mind, he intended to plunge into the river near the soldiers' quarters, and then to swim across to J\u0101jnagar. As misfortune would have it, owing to the disappearance of Tughral, all his officers, soldiers and followers turned towards different directions. And Malik Muqaddar, at whose hands the slaughter of Tughral had been destined, marched in pursuit of Tughral, and encountered him on the river-bank. Then Malik Muqaddar shot a shooting arrow at Tughral's shoulder, dismounted the latter from his horse, and himself dismounting from his own horse, severed Tughral's head from the body. Seeing that the followers of Tughral were searching for their master, Malik Muqaddar hid Tughral's head in the mud by the river-side, and flung his body into the river, and pulling off his own garments, he set himself to washing them. At this moment, Tughral's soldiers arrived, across the river, or somewhere close to the modern Bhoyrab Bazar ferry, seriously planning to cross over on boats from the Dacca side to the Tipperah tract (which has been identified here with J\u0101jnagar), with the old and powerful Emperor of Delhi (Ghiyasu-d-din Balban) shadowing him. This J\u0101jnagar, therefore, in Bengal, is different from J\u0101jnagar in Orissa,\nshouting out \"Lord of the world! Lord of the world!\" and searched for Tughral. Not finding him, they took to their heels.\n\nThey shot an arrow at his heart,\\(^1\\) Dismounted him from his horse, and cut off his head. When Tughral at that place was killed owing to his in-alertness,\n\nOne shout arose from every side. The adherents of Tughral were completely routed, From the absence of their leader, they were all cowed down.\n\nAt this time Malik B\u0101rbak Baras\\(^2\\) arrived, and Muqaddar running forward announced the joyful tidings of the victory. Malik B\u0101rbak applauding him sent a despatch to the Emperor, announcing the victory, together with the head of Tughral. On the following day, together with the booty and prisoners of Tughral's army, he proceeded himself to the Emperor, and narrated the story of the victory. And Malik Muhammad Tirandaz\\(^3\\) was promoted to the first rank, and his brother Malik Muqaddar\\(^4\\) received the title of Tughral-kush (\"Tughral-slayer\"), and was raised to the peerage. Sultan Ghi\u0101su-d-din Balban after this marched back to Lakhnauti, and set himself to the work of chastisement. Along both sides of the road passing through the market-place of the City, putting up scaffolds, the Emperor hanged such adherents of Tughral as had been taken prisoners, and capturing their women and children, wherever found, he had them slaughtered at Lakhnauti, after putting them to indescribable tortures. Till that time, none of the Emperors of Delhi had slaughtered the children and women of miscreants.\\(^5\\) After this, the Emperor bestowed the kingdom of\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) These verses, with slight variations, have been borrowed very probably from Amir Khusrau, the poet-laureate of Emperor Ghi\u0101su-d-din Balban.\n\n\\(^2\\) In Tarikh Firuz Shah\u012b (p. 88.) Malik Barbak Bektars.\n\n\\(^3\\) In Tarikh Firuz Shah\u012b (p. 88) Malik Muhammad Shirandaz.\n\n\\(^4\\) From Tarikh Firuz Shah\u012b (pp. 88, 90 and 91) Malik Muqadar and Tughral-kush would seem to be two different individuals.\n\n\\(^5\\) The author of Tarikh Firuz Shah\u012b remarks that on both sides of the principal bazaar of Lakhnauti that was more than one karoh long, scaffolds were set up, and men, women and children were hanged. Such cruelty, sorrowfully remarks Ziau-d-din Barni, had never before been perpetrated by Musalman sovereigns of Delhi. (See pp. 91-92 Tarikh Firuz Shah\u012b).\nLakhnauti on his own son, Bughra Khan, giving him at the same time the treasures, etc., and other valuables of Tughral that\n\n1 Bughra Khan, younger son of Emperor Balban, assumed the royal title of Sultan Nasiruddin at his elevation to the throne of Bengal. He was the first of a succession of Balbani kings who ruled over Bengal, from 1282 A.C. to 1331 A.C. (or 681 A.H. to 731 A.H.) and had mostly their court at Sunargaon near Dacca. Nasiruddin Bughra Khan, son of Emperor Balban, reigned over Bengal from 681 H. to 691 (1282 A.C. to 1292 A.C.) and was succeeded by his son Ruknuddin who assumed the title of Sultan Kai-Kans. From inscriptions found at Gangarampur and Khagol, near Lakhisarai, he appears to have been alive in 697 H. (A.C. 1297). Mr. Thomas has published coins of this king bearing the dates 691, 693, 694, 695 A.H. He appears to have been succeeded by his brother who reigned under the name of Shamsuddin Firuz Shah. Firuz Shah had several sons, namely, Bughra Khan, Nasiruddin, Ghiyasuddin or Bahadur Khan, Qutlu Khan, and Hatim Khan. The third son, Ghiyasuddin, made conquests in Eastern Bengal, established himself at Sunargaon near Dacca, and struck coins from 1311 A.C. under the name of Bahadur Shah. The fifth son Hatim Khan was in 1309 and 1315 A.C. Governor of Oudh. Firuz Shah died in 718 H. (1318 A.C.) Quarrels then broke out between the several sons of Firuz Shah, who was succeeded by his eldest son who took the title of Shahabuddin Bughra Shah who ruled at Lakhnauti in 1318-19. Soon after his accession, Bughra Shah was defeated by his brother Bahadur Shah who reigned at Sunargaon. Bughra Shah and his brother Nasiruddin took refuge with Emperor Tughlaq Shah who in 1320 had mounted the throne of Delhi. Qutlu Khan, another brother, was killed by Bahadur Shah who was now supreme King over Bengal and Behar, and held a magnificent Court at Sunargaon.\n\nAt the instigation of Bughra Shah and Nasiruddin, the fugitives (says Ibn Batuta), Emperor Tughlaq Shah invaded Bengal. When the Imperial army left Delhi, Bahadur Shah retired to Sunargaon, whilst Nasiruddin joining the Emperor at Tirhut came with the latter to Lakhnauti, when the Emperor confirmed Nasiruddin as Governor of Lakhnauti. The Emperor sent his adopted son Tatar Khan, Governor of Zafarabad (near Jaunpur) with an army to operate against Sultan Bahadur Shah, who was captured and sent to Delhi with a chain round his neck. At this time, also, two additional distinct Provinces in Bengal were constituted, viz., Sunargaon and Satgaon, each being placed under a Military Governor; whilst Behar was separated from Bengal. Sunargaon was placed under Tatar Khan.\n\nWith the accidental death of Emperor Tughlaq Shah and the accession of his successor Emperor Muhammad Shah Tughlaq, other changes took place in the administration of Bengal. The new Emperor released Bahadur Shah, allowed him to return to Sunargaon, on condition that the Bengal coinage was to bear the joint names of Bahadur Shah and the Emperor Muhammad Tughlaq, and also that in the Khu'bah the names of both were to\nhad been captured, except the elephants; and conferring on him\nthe title of Sultan Nasiru-d-din, he placed on the son's head the\nroyal umbrella, and allowed also the Khutbah to be recited and the\ncoin to be minted in his name. And at the time of departure, the\nEmperor giving his son some parting advice, said: \"It is not\ndiscreet for the king of Lakhnauti, be he a relation or a stranger,\nto quarrel with or rebel against the Emperor of Delhi. And if\nthe Emperor of Delhi marches to Lakhnauti, the ruler of Lakhnauti\nshould retreating take refuge in some distant corner, and when\nthe Emperor of Delhi withdraws, he should return to Lakhnauti,\nand resume his work. And in the levy of revenue from sub-\njects, he should observe the middle course, that is, he should\nnot levy such a low amount, that they should become refractory\nand disloyal, nor such an excessive amount, that they should be\nground down and oppressed. And he should pay such an amount\nof salary to his officers, that it may suffice for them from year\nto year, and that they may not be pinched in regard to their\nnecessary expenses. In matters of administration, he should take\ncounsel with wise people who are sincere and loyal; and in the\nenforcement of orders, he should abstain from self-indulgence, and\n\nbe recited. Tatar Khan who was hitherto Military Governor of Sunargaon,\nreceived the title of Bahram Khan, and was stationed at Sunargaon at the\nCourt of Bahadur Shah, as a sort of Imperial Resident. Nasiru-d-din was\ncontinued as Subordinate Governor of Lakhnauti.\n\nIn 726 A.H. (1326 A.C.), Nasiru-d-din died, and Muhammad Shah\nappointed Malik Bidar Khilji as Governor of Lakhnauti with the title of\nQadr Khan. Bahadur Shah, the king, at Sunargaon, attempted soon after\nto throw off all outward signs of allegiance to the Emperor, who sent an\narmy to Bahram's assistance. Bahadur Shah, the last Bengal Balban\nsovereign, and the last royal representative of the house of Emperor Ghiasu-\nd-din Balban, was defeated and put to death about 731 A.H. or 1331\nA.C. Bengal remained Imperialist till the death of Bahram Khan in 1338\nA.C., when Fakhrud-din successfully revolted, killed Qadr Khan and\nestablished the independence of Bengal.

In the care for the condition of the army, he should not be negligent, and he should consider it incumbent upon himself to show them considerateness and to win their hearts, and he should not allow negligence and indolence to intervene.

You should seek protection with persons who relinquishing this world, have dedicated themselves to God\u2019s service.\n\nHelp from the old hems of saints,\nIs stronger than the strength of a hundred walls of Alexander.\u201d\n\nAfter this, bidding adieu to his son, the Emperor returned to Delhi, by forced marches, after three months.\u00b9 The period of the rule of Tughral in Bengal was twenty-five years and some months.\n\nRULE OF BUGHR\u0100 KH\u00c2N, STYLED SULT\u0100N NASIRU-D-D\u012aN, SON OF EMPEROR GHIASU-D-D\u012aN BALBAN.\n\nWhen Sult\u0101n Nasiru-d-din became ruler of the kingdom of Lakhnauti, after some time, his elder brother who was named Sult\u0101n Muhammad and was known as Kh\u0101n-i-Shahid\u00b2 was killed at Mult\u0101n, fighting against the Mughals. And Sult\u0101n Ghiasu-d-din Balban who was much attached to him, became dejected by his death, and summoned Sult\u0101n Nasiru-d-din from Lakhnauti. When the latter reached Delhi, after observing the necessary mourning ceremonies for his elder brother, he attempted to console the heart of his father. The Emperor said: \u201cThe death of your brother has made me sick and feeble, and soon the time of\n\n\u00b9 In Tarikh Firuz Sh\u0101hi (p. 107), \u201cafter three years.\u201d\n\u00b2 Sult\u0101n Muhammad, eldest son of Emperor Ghiasu-d-din Balban, was Imperial Viceroy of Mult\u0101n Province or Vil\u0101yet at this time. This Prince was brave, gallant and accomplished, and he fell gallantly fighting between Lahore and Dibalpur against the Mughul hordes under Tamar from Central Asia who were harrying at this time the North-Western frontier of India. Hence the Prince is styled \u201cKh\u0101n-i-Shahid\u201d or \u201cMartyred Prince or Chief.\u201d His death was a great shock to the aged Emperor. (See Tarikh-i-Firuz Sh\u0101hi, pp. 109-10). The Prince was a patron of learning, and to his court at Mult\u0101n were attached the celebrated poets, Amir Khw\u0101raz and Amir Hasan, for whose biographical sketch, see Badaoni, Vol. I., pp. 200-201.\nmy departure from the world shall approach. At this time, your separation from me is not proper, because besides yourself, I have no other heir. Your son, Kaiqub\u0101d, and your nephew, Kai Khusrau, are young, and have no experience of life. Should the Empire fall into their hands, they would be incapable of defending it, and you would have to pay homage to either who might ascend the throne of Delhi. Therefore, it is meet that you should remain with me.\u201d N\u0101\u1e63iru-d-din, according to his father\u2019s request, remained with his father. But on seeing his father regain some health, he quickly under pretext of hunting went out of the city, and without taking leave of the Emperor returned to Lakhnauti. The Emperor, being affected at this, again fell ill, and in the year 685 A.H., passed from this transitory world. And when Sult\u0101n Muizu-d-din Kaiqub\u0101d, after the death of his grand-father, at the age of eighteen years, mounted the throne of Delhi, in consequence of youth, indulging in frivolities and dissipations, he became unmindful of the affairs of the Empire, excepting women and wine.\u00b9\n\nAnd Malik Niz\u0101mu-d-din setting himself to the destruction of the Balbani family, induced Muizu-d-din to call his cousin Kaikhusr\u0101\u016b from Mult\u0101n, and to kill him on the way, and to dismiss many of the loyal Umar\u0101. Sult\u0101n N\u0101\u1e63iru-d-din Bughr\u0101 Kh\u0101n at Lakhnauti, on receiving news of the negligence of his son, and of the overbearing influence of Malik Niz\u0101mu-d-din, wrote to his son letters containing instructions, and by insinuations and hints, advised\n\n\u00b9 Ziauddin Barni, author of Tar\u012bkh-i-Firuz Sh\u0101h\u012b (p. 121) states that shortly before his death in 686 A.H. (1287 A.C.), the aged and venerable Emperor Ghiasu-d-din Balban summoned to his presence in his palace in Delhi, Malik-ul-Umara Fakhru-d-din Kotwal (or police commissioner) of Delhi, Khwajah Husain Basri, the Vizier or Prime Minister, and some others, and instructed them to place Kai Khusrau, son of Sult\u0101n Muhammad, on the throne. After the Emperor\u2019s death, however, the Kotwal and his party placed Kaiqubad, son of Sult\u0101n N\u0101\u1e63iru-d-din Bughra Kh\u0101n (King of Bengal, and second son of the Emperor) on the throne. The personnel of Sult\u0101n Muizu-d-din Kaiqub\u0101d\u2019s administration consisted of (1) Malik-ul-Umara Kotwal of Delhi, (2) Nizamu-d-din, nephew of Malik-ul-Umara, who became Dadbig or Chief Justice, and subsequently Wasir or Prime Minister, (3) Malik Quamu-d-din who became Wakildar or Administrator-General. Emperor Kaiqubad, who was a boy of seventeen years, was addicted to pleasures, and spent most of his time in the charming pleasure-villas of Kilukhari, in the suburbs of Delhi. Nizamu-d-din the Wazir who now assumed the title of Nizamu-l-Mulk, set about devising means to destroy the house of Balban (see Tar\u012bkh-i-Firuz Sh\u0101h\u012b, p. 132).\nhim to beware of the wily enemy in the person of Nizamu-d-din. It was of no use. In despair, two years after the death of Emperor Balban, in the year 687 A.H., with the object of conquering the province of Delhi, and chastising his son, Nasiru-d-din Bughra Khan marched with his army. On reaching Behar, Sultan Nasiru-d-din passing from Behar to the banks of the river Saru, encamped.\n\nThe standards of the Emperor of the world were pitched\nOn the banks of the Ghagar, in the environs of the town.\nThe Ghagar was on one side, and the Saru on the other,\nFrom excessive heat, the soldiers foamed from their mouths.\nThe sword-casting East from yonder side of the river\nBecame bright as if the sun had risen;\nOn the banks of the river, the marshalling of the forces\nFlashed like two Suns from two sides.\n\nAt length, after nearing each other, Sultan Nasiru-d-din, abandoning the idea of the conquest of Delhi, made overtures for peace. And Sultan Muizu-d-din, owing to the instigation of Malik Nizamu-d-din, refused to make peace, and prepared to fight. After negotiations had proceeded for three days between the contending parties, on the fourth day, Sultan Nasiru-d-din with his own hand wrote:\n\n\"Son! I have a great longing to meet you. I have no further strength of self-restraint in your separation. If you show a way by which I who am consumed by the fire of misfortune, may behold\n\n1 The text here is rather confused. In Ferishta, the rendering is as follows: \"When Sultan Muizu-d-din Kaiqubad heard of the intention of his father (Sultan Nasiru-d-din Bughra Khan, King of Bengal) and of the latter's arrival in Behar, he (Emperor Kaiqubad), too, arrayed his forces, and in the hottest part of the year reached the banks of the Ghagar river, and halted. And Sultan Nasiru-d-din, on hearing of the news, advanced from Behar, reached the banks of the river Sro, and halted.\" The meeting between Sultan Nasiru-d-din Bughra Khan and his son the Emperor Kaiqubad is immortalized in the pages of \"Qiranu-s-Sadain\" by Amir Khurram, the celebrated poet of Delhi. The camp of the father was on the bank of the river Sro or Saru or Sarju, the old river boundary-line between the Musalman Kingdom of Bengal (which included Behar in those days) and the Empire of Delhi, and the camp of the son was on the opposite banks of the Sro. Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi, p. 141. The Qiranu-s-Sadain fixes the meeting-place at Ajudheya on the banks of the Ghagar.\nyou, and, Jacob-like, if once more my eye which has become blind, becomes bright by the sight of Joseph, no harm shall betide to your sovereignty and enjoyment.\" The Sultan wound up this message with the following verse:\n\n\"Although paradise is a happy region,\nNothing is better than the joy of union.\"\n\nSultan Muizu-d-din being touched by the personal of his father's letter desired to proceed unattended, to meet his father. Nizamu-d-din used dissuasion, and arranged that the Emperor, with all Imperial pomp and paraphernalia, should for the purpose of meeting his father march from the bank of the river Ghagar towards a plain, and then encamp on the bank of the Sar\u016b. And it was also arranged that out of regard for the rank of the Emperor of Delhi, Nasiru-d-din crossing the Sar\u016b should come to visit Kaiqub\u0101d, who should remain seated on the throne. Then Bughr\u0101 Khan embarking on a boat crossed the river, and proceeded to the tent of Muizu-d-din Kaiqub\u0101d. Kaiqubad being overpowered by feelings dismounted from the throne, prostrated himself on his father's feet, and both the father and the son embracing each other, and giving each other kisses on the head and the face shed tears. After this, the father catching the hand of the son, placed the latter on the throne, and desired to stand in front of it. The son descending from the throne placed the father on it, and himself respectfully sat before him; and ceremonies of rejoicings were performed. After a while, Sultan Nasiru-d-din left, and crossing the river returned to his tent. From both sides gifts were exchanged. Several days successively, Sultan Nasiru-d-din went to meet his son, and both were in each other's company. And on the day of departure, after speaking some words of advice, and taking his son in the lap, he departed, and weeping and crying returned to his own camp. That day he ate no food, and told his confidants: \"To-day I have bid the last farewell to my son.\"\n\n1 It is stated that on the day of departure, Sultan Nasiru-d-din Bughra Khan exhorted his son, Emperor Kaiqubad, to attend to prayer and to observe the fast of Ramzan, taught him certain regulations and fixed rules of sovereignty, warned him against excesses in wine and neglect of State matters, rebuked him for killing Kai Khurran and other noted Amirs and Maluks of Ghiasu-d-din Balban, and advised him to dismiss Nizamu-d-din alias Nizamul Mulk, the Wazir. (See Tarikh-i-Firuz-Shahi, pp. 144 to 156).\nThen marching back from that place, he returned to his kingdom. And when Sult\u0101n Muizu-d-din Kaiqub\u0101d at the end of 689 A.H. was slain,\u00b9 and the Empire was transferred from the Ghorian dynasty to the Khilji family, and Sult\u0101n Jalalu-d-din Khilji\u00b2 mounted the throne of Delhi, Sult\u0101n N\u0101\u1e63iru-d-din seeing no alternative except profession of loyalty and submission put aside the royal umbrella and the Khutbah, conducted himself like other nobles, and remained contented with the fief of Lakhnauti.

The period of the rule of Sult\u0101n N\u0101\u1e63iru-d-din in Bengal was six years.\n\n---\n\nRULE OF BAH\u0100DUR SH\u0100H.\n\nIn the reign of Sult\u0101n \u2018Al\u0101n-d-din, Bah\u0101dur Kh\u0101n who was one of the connexions\u2074 of Sult\u0101n N\u0101\u1e63iru-d-din, and was one of the leading nobles of Sult\u0101n \u2018Al\u0101n-d-din, was entrusted with the Viceroyalty of Bengal. For many years he occupied the Viceregal throne, and enforced the recital of the Khutbah and the minting\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 See Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi, p. 173. According to other accounts Emperor Kaiqubad was poisoned at the instigation of the Amir-ul-Umara who was in league with Jallalu-d-din Khilji. With him (Kaiqubad) ended the Balbani dynasty in Delhi, but, as will be observed in these pages, it lingered for a longer period in the Bengal Kingdom in the persons of the Balbani Kings of Bengal.\n\n\u00b2 Sult\u0101n Jalalu-d-din Khilji is said to have been descended from Qalej Kh\u0101n, son-in-law of Changiz Kh\u0101n. He was Governor of Samanah and held the office of State Secretary (Arzi Mamalik) in the Cabinet of Emperor Kaiqubad. Jallalu-d-din ascended the Delhi throne in 1290 A.C. or 689 A.H. and with him commenced the Khilji dynasty which continued to reign over India till 1320 A.C. During his reign, Muhammadan conquests were extended into Southern India through the prowess of his nephew, Alau-d-din Khilji. See Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi pp. 170-174, Badaoni, p. 167, vol. 1. Badaoni states that \u201cQalij\u201d and \u201cKhilj\u201d were different, and that \u201cKhilj\u201d was one of the children of Yafus, son of Noah.\n\n\u00b3 Sult\u0101n Qutbu-d-din Khilji was son of Sult\u0101n Alan-d-din Khilji. See Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi p. 408 and 381.\n\n\u2074 In respect of the weak rule in Bengal of Sult\u0101n Nasiru-d-din Bughra Sh\u0101h (son of Emperor Balban), Ziau-d-din Barni (p. 189) relates that Emperor Jalalu-d-din\u2019s favourite mode of disposing of dacoits captured in the Delhi territory, was to send them in shiploads to Bengal, where they were let loose.\nof coins after the names of the Emperors of Delhi. During the reign, however, of Sultan Qutbu-d-din Khilji, he usurped the sovereignty of Bengal, and proclaiming himself Bahadur Shah, introduced the Khutbah and the coin in the kingdom of Bengal after his own name, and commenced oppressions. For some time, he passed in this wise. But when the Empire of Delhi passed to Ghiasu-d-din Tughlak Shah, in the year 724 A.H. petitions from Lakhnauti describing the oppressions of the rulers of that country were received. Sultan Tughlak Shah with an efficient army marched towards Bengal. When he reached Tirhut, Sultan Nasiru-d-din whose fief had not been confiscated during Alau-d-din's reign owing to his good conduct and who resided in a corner of Lakhnauti, not finding strength in himself to contend against Tughlak Shah, submitted to his fate, marched from Lakhnauti to Tirhut, and presenting himself before the Emperor offered\n\n1 On the defeat of Khusrav Khan, (Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi, pp. 420 and 421) the nobles placed Ghazi-ul-Mulk on the throne of Delhi. Ghazi-ul-Mulk then assumed the title of Ghiasu-d-din Tughlak Shah. His father was a Turkish slave, named Malik, of Sultan Ghiasu-d-din Balban, and his mother was of a Punjab family. Brave, noble, and magnanimous, he was the founder of the Tughlak dynasty which reigned for ninety-four years at Delhi (1320-1414 A.C.). He founded the city of Tughla-kabad, about 4 miles east of Delhi. He reigned from 1320 to 1324 A.C. In order to put down the assumption of entire independence by Bahadur Shah at Sunargaon in Bengal, Ghiasu-d-din Tughlak marched to Sunargaon, fought a decisive engagement, took Bahadur Shah a prisoner, and marched back with the latter towards Delhi, storming the fort of Tirhat, and leaving Nasiru-d-din as Governor of Vilayet-i-Lakhnauti. Ghiasu-d-din divided Bengal into three provinces, namely (1) Vilayet-i-Lakhnauti, (2) Vilayet-i-Satgaoan. (3) Vilayet-i-Sunargaoan, placing each under a distinct Governor, and placing a Viceroy (stationed at Sunargaoan) over all the Governors. Tarikh-i-Firuz-Shahi p. 451.\n\n2 This Nasiru-d-din was a grandson of Sultan Nasiru-d-din Bughra Shah, son of Emperor Balban. He was Governor of Lakhnauti, but had been ousted by his brother Bahadur Shah, king of Bengal, who held his court at Sunargaon. This Nasiru-d-din and another brother Bughra Khan had taken refuge at the time with the Emperor of Delhi (Tughlak Shah) who at their instigation invaded Bengal to chastise their brother, Bahadur Shah (king of Bengal). The text, however, is misleading, and would incorrectly indicate that the Nasiru-d-din here referred to is Sultan Nasiru-d-din Bughra Shah, king of Bengal (son of Emperor Balban). See, however, Blochmann's \"Contributions to History and Geography of Bengal\" and Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi, pp. 450-451.\nnumerous presents. Sult\u0101n Ghi\u0101su-d-din Tughlak Sh\u0101h treated him honourably, bestowed on him the Royal Umbrella and the Royal Staff, and ratified according to the old custom the continuance of Sult\u0101n N\u0101\u1e63iru-d-din\u2019s fief. And bringing to his presence Bah\u0101dur Sh\u0101h who had proved hostile, the Emperor enrolled him in the ranks of nobles. He, too, submitting to the Emperor, behaved like one of the nobles. Emperor Ghi\u0101su-d-din, appointing his adopted son, T\u0101t\u0101r Kh\u0101n, Governor of Sun\u0101rg\u0101on, and entrusting to N\u0101\u1e63iru-d-din the over-lordship of Sun\u0101rg\u0101on, Gaur and Bengal, returned to Delhi. But soon after, Sult\u0101n N\u0101\u1e63iru-d-din died. The period of the rule of Bah\u0101dur Sh\u0101h in Bengal was thirty-eight years.\n\nRULE OF QADR KH\u0100N.\n\nWhen Sult\u0101n Ghi\u0101su-d-din Tughlak Sh\u0101h returned from Bengal, before he could reach Delhi, on the way, in the month of Rabiul-awwal in the year 725 A.H., he perished under the roof of a newly built pavilion. His son, Ul\u0101gh Kh\u0101n, ascended the throne of Delhi and proclaiming himself Muhammad Sh\u0101h bestowed on all the nobles offices and Jagirs, and bestowing the title of Qadr\n\n1 This text is not quite accurate on all points. See note ante, regarding the fortunes of the Balbani dynasty in Bengal.\n\n2 Ul\u0101gh Kh\u0101n or Al\u0101gh Kh\u0101n alias Fakhru-d-din Juna, nephew and son-in-law of Emperor Ghi\u0101su-d-din Tughlak Sh\u0101h, on the death of the latter by the accidental fall of the roof of a newly erected pavilion, ascended the throne of Delhi under the title of Sult\u0101n Muhammad Sh\u0101h Tughlak in 725 A.H. An accomplished scholar, a general of the first order, a man of consummate ability, his eccentricity and visionary schemes marred his success as a sovereign. His great ambition was to extend his empire over the world, and to be a second Alexander. He fruitlessly threw away the pick of his splendid army for the invasion of Persia and the conquest of China. Though the fertility of his genius evolved and organised a revenue system, his financial eccentricity in establishing a fixed currency of copper coins completely disorganised it. He received an embassy from the Khalifa of Egypt, who sent out to him the investiture of Royalty. In his reign a severe famine broke out in Delhi, and in consequence there was a general exodus of its population to Bengal. He restored Bah\u0101dur Sh\u0101h to the kingdom of Sun\u0101rg\u0101on on certain conditions, but subsequently dethroned him. In his reign, Bengal became independent under Fakhru-d-din. (See Tarikh-i-Firuz Sh\u0101hi, pp. 428, 453, 457 to 461, 473, 475, 478, 80, 492.)\nKh\u0101n on Malik Bed\u0101r Khilji, who was one of his leading nobles, he assigned to him the country of Lakhnauti, which had fallen vacant by the death of Sult\u0101n N\u0101\u1e63iru-d-d\u012bn. And giving the title of Bahr\u0101m Kh\u0101n to Tat\u0101r Kh\u0101n, whom Tughlak Sh\u0101h had appointed Governor of Sun\u0101rg\u0101on, and who was an adopted brother of Sult\u0101n Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u0101h, and bestowing on him in one day one hundred elephants and one thousand horses and one karor gold coins, and conferring on him the royal umbrella and the staff, and making him Viceroy of Bengal and Sun\u0101rg\u0101on, he sent him to Bengal with all honours. And after fourteen years' administration of that country, Qadr Kh\u0101n was killed at the hands of his servant, Fakhru-d-d\u012bn, as will be related hereafter.\nCHAPTER II.\n\nAN ACCOUNT OF THE INDEPENDENT MUSALMAN KINGS WHO IN THE KINGDOM OF BENGAL MOUNTED THE THRONE, AND RECITED THE KHUTBAH AFTER THEIR OWN NAMES.\n\nIt ought to be known that from the reign of Sult\u0101n Qutbuddin Aibak to the reign of Sult\u0101n Ghi\u0101su-d-din Md. Tughlak Sh\u0101h, seventeen Emperors ruled at Delhi for a period of one hundred and fifty years, and that in the kingdom of Bengal its rulers exercised authority as Viceroys of the Emperors of Delhi, and that the Khutbah and the coins of the Emperors of Delhi were current in Bengal. If any of the Viceroys rebelling introduced the Khutbah and the coins after their own names, the Emperors of Delhi considering their chastisement necessary, swiftly punished them. In the reign of Muhammad Sh\u0101h, Qadr Kh\u0101n, being appointed Governor of Lakhnauti, for fourteen years administered the affairs of that State. Then Malik Fakhru-d-din, who was Qadr Kh\u0101n's Armour-Superintendent, meddling in administrative matters, obtained much influence, and, resolving in mind to usurp the Viceroyalty, watched for an opportunity. Finding Qadr Kh\u0101n off his guard, Fakhru-d-din revolted, killed his own master, and became Viceroy of the kingdom of Bengal. When the Empire of Muhammad Sh\u0101h, the Emperor of Delhi, fell into complete decay, aiming in his mind amongst other things at the Emperor's capture, Fakhru-d-din withdrew his hand from submission to the Emperor of Delhi, and proclaimed himself king.\u00b9 The Emperor of Delhi, owing to confusion in his own\n\n\u00b9 The period of the Independent Musalman Kings of Bengal lasted from 1338 to 1538 A.C., and began with Fakhru-d-din Abul Muzaffar Mubarak Sh\u0101h, who was Silahdar or armour-bearer to Bahram Kh\u0101n, the Governor of Sunarg\u0101on. On his master's death in 739 H. or 1338 A.C., Fakhra killed Qadr Kh\u0101n, Governor of Lakhnauti, and subdued provinces of Lakhnauti, Satgaon and Sunargaon, and assumed independence under the title of Fakhruddin (Tarikh-\nEmpire, could not direct his attention towards the kingdom of Bengal. From that time, the kingdom of Bengal became independent and distinct from the Delhi Empire. Fakhru-d-din was the first king who had the Khutbah of sovereignty recited after his own name in the Kingdom of Bengal.\n\nAN ACCOUNT OF THE SOVEREIGNTY OF SULT\u0100N FAKHRU-D-D\u012aN.\n\nWhen Sult\u0101n Fakhru-d-din ascended the throne of the kingdom of Lakhnauti, he sent out his officer Mukhalis Kh\u0101n with an efficient army for the subjugation of the outlying provinces of Bengal. Malik \u2018Ali Mub\u0101rik, the generalissimo of Qadr Kh\u0101n, encountered him with a large army, and after much fighting killed Mukhalis Kh\u0101n, and routed the latter\u2019s entire force.

His coins minted at Sun\u0101rg\u0101on, (published in Thomas\u2019s \u201cInitial Coinage\u201d, would indicate that he reigned for ten years and some months. Ibn-i-Bat\u016btah mentions that he was an eminent man, and very generous. His capital appears to have been at Sun\u0101rg\u0101on. His son-in-law, Zafar Kh\u0101n fled from Sun\u0101rg\u0101on to Firuz Sh\u0101h in Delhi, who at his request (Tarikh-i-Firuz Sh\u0101h\u012b by Shams-i-Siraj, pp. 105-114) invaded Bengal a second time during Sekandar Sh\u0101h\u2019s reign. Bengal attained great prosperity during the rule of these Independent Musalman Kings. Forts and public buildings were erected, Mosques, Colleges, Students\u2019 Hostels and Travellers\u2019 Guest-houses and Khanqahs were established in all parts of the Kingdom, tanks excavated, and roads laid down. Two great Royal Houses\u2014one of Haji Ilyas and another of Alan-d-din Husain Sh\u0101h (with a brief break of about forty years, during which Rajah Kans and his successors usurped the Bengal Kingdom) reigned during this period. The Kingdom of Bengal received territorial expansion during this period. Western Assam (or Kamr\u016bp), portions of Koch-Behar, and portions of Jajnagar (or Orissa), the whole of North Behar, (Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi, p. 586) and eastern portions of South Behar up to generally the town of Behar, were subject to the Bengal Kingdom. Musalman arms were carried far to the east across the Megna, which had hitherto proved a great barrier to Musalman extension, right up to Silhat and the western portions of Tipera and Noakhali districts, including Chittagong. Great theistic movements having for their object the conciliation of the two races, sprang up. Kabir and Chaitanya, the great spiritual leaders who preached catholic doctrines, flourished in this period.\n\n1 This was in 1388 A.C.\n'Ali Mub\u0101rik. And Malik 'Ali Mub\u0101rik collecting a large army proclaimed himself Sult\u0101n 'Al\u0101n-d-d\u012bn, marched with his forces against Sult\u0101n Fakhr\u016b-d-d\u012bn, and, in the year 741 A.H., after fighting captured him, and slaying him, avenged the murder of Qadr Kh\u0101n.\n\nYe murdered, whom hast thou murdered, that to-day they have murdered thee?\n\nTo-morrow they will kill him who has to-day killed thee!\n\nAfter this, Sult\u0101n 'Al\u0101n-d-d\u012bn, after leaving an efficient force to garrison Lakhnauti, himself proceeded to subjugate the outlying provinces of Bengal. The rule of Sult\u0101n Fakhr\u016b-d-d\u012bn lasted two years and five months.\n\n---\n\nTHE ACCESSION TO THE THRONE OF 'AL\u012a MUB\u0100RIK STYLED SULT\u0100N 'AL\u0100U-D-D\u012aN.\n\nIt is said that in the beginning Malik 'Ali Mub\u0101rik was one of the trusty servants of Malik Firuz Rajab. And Malik Firuz was\n\n---\n\n1 The account in Badaoni (vol. I, p. 230 Pers. (text) gives a different version. Badaoni states as follows:\u2014On the death of Bahram Kh\u0101n, Governor of Sunargaon, in 739 A. H., Malik Fakhruddin who was his Silahdar or Quarter-master General, revolted, assumed the title of Fakhruddin, and fought against Qadr Kh\u0101n, Governor of Lakhnauti, and was defeated. A second time, Fakhruddin fought against Qadr Kh\u0101n, and defeated the latter (Qadr Kh\u0101n's own soldiers killing Qadr Kh\u0101n), established his rule over Sunargaon Province, and detached his officer Mukhalis to operate against Lakhnauti. Ali Mubarik, Adjutant General (Ariz-i-Lashkar) of the Army of Qadr Kh\u0101n killed Mukhalis, established his own independence (in Lakhnauti), and sent out letters to the Emperor Muhammad Shah Tughlak, who sent out Malik-Yusaf, who died on his way to Bengal. After this, the Emperor being engaged with other affairs, did not send out any others to Bengal. For State reasons (observing the hostility of Fakhruddin of Sunargaon) Ali Mubarik in Lakhnauti assumed regal honours and the title of Sult\u0101n Alau-d-d\u012bn. Malik Ilyas Haji, who was a tribal chief and a military commander, after some days, in collusion with certain Omara and Maliks of Lakhnauti, killed Alau-d-d\u012bn, and himself assumed the title of Shamsu-d-d\u012bn. In 741 A. H., the Emperor Muhammad Shah Tughlak marched to Sunargaon, captured Fakhruddin, brought him to Lakhnauti, and killed him, and then retired to Delhi. Thenceforth Shamsuddin Ilyas Haji ruled independently over Bengal.\n\n2 His name appears from his coins (published in Thomas's \"Initial Coinage\"), to be Alau-d-d\u012bn Ab\u016bl Muzaffar 'Ali Sh\u0101h. His capital appears to have\na nephew of Sultan Ghiasu-d-din Tughlak Shah, and a cousin of Sultan Muhammad Shah. When Sultan Muhammad Shah ascended the throne of Delhi, in the first year of his reign, he appointed Malik Firuz to be his Secretary. At that time, some misdemeanor came to pass on the part of Haji Ilyas, foster-brother of Ali Mubarak, and owing to that he (Haji Ilyas) escaped from Delhi. When Malik Firuz demanded him from Ali Mubarak, the latter searched for him. When no trace of his whereabouts was obtained, Ali Mubarak informed Malik Firuz of his escape. Malik Firuz remonstrating with him, banished him also from his presence. Ali Mubarak started for Bengal. On the way he saw in a dream Hazrat Shah Makhdum Jalalu-d-din Tabrizi (may God sanctify his sepulchre!) and showing submissiveness and humility pleased the saint, who said: \"We have bestowed on you the Subah of Bengal, but you should build for us a shrine.\" Ali Mubarak agreeing to this, enquired in what place the shrine was required to be built. The saint replied: \"In the town of Panduah, at a place where thou shalt find three bricks, one over the other, and one fresh hundred-leaved rose beneath those bricks; at that place the shrine should be built.\" When he reached Bengal, entering the service of Qadr Khan he stayed there, until gradually he became generalissimo of Qadr Khan's army. And when Malik Fakhru-d-din revolting against Qadr Khan, and killing his benefactor, assumed the reins of sovereignty, Ali Mubarak proclaiming himself Sultan Alau-d-din and drawing his forces against Fakhru-d-din, as has been mentioned before, avenged the murder of his benefactor, by slaying Fakhru-d-din. With great promptitude, posting a garrison at Lakhnauti, Sultan Alau-d-din turned his attention to the conquest of other provinces of Bengal. When he introduced the Khutbah and the\n\nbeen at Panduah, from the circumstance that his coins appear all to have been minted at Firuzabad (i.e., Panduah). Indeed, Panduah is known as 'Ali Shah's capital.'\n\n1 Shaikh Jalaluddin Tabrizi was a disciple of Shaikh Said Tabrizi. After travelling for some time, he joined Shaikh Shahabuddin and became the latter's Khalifa or chief disciple. He was a great friend of Khwajah Qutbuddin and Shaikh Bahauddin. Shaikh Najmuddin the junior who was at the time Shaikh-ul-Islam of Delhi, bore ill-feeling towards him, and made false accusations against his piety and character, and so Jalaluddin retired to Bengal. He is buried at the port of Deomahal (Maldive) See Seir, Vol. I, p. 231 and Ain.\n\n13\ncoin of the kingdom of Bengal after his own name, becoming intoxicated with luxury and success, he forgot the injunction of the saint, so that one night he saw in a dream the saint, who said: \"Al\u0101u-d-d\u012bn, you have obtained the kingdom of Bengal, but forgotten my bidding.\" Al\u0101n-d-d\u012bn on the following day searching for the bricks, and finding them agreeably to the directions of the saint, erected there a shrine, the trace whereof exists up to this time. At that time H\u0101ji Ily\u0101s also came to Pand\u016bah. Sult\u0101n 'Al\u0101n-d-d\u012bn for some time kept him a prisoner, but by the intercession of Ily\u0101s's mother, who was the nurse of Sult\u0101n 'Al\u0101n-d-d\u012bn, he released him, and giving him an important position admitted him to his presence. H\u0101ji Ily\u0101s in a short time gaining over the army to his side, one day with the help of eunuchs slew Sult\u0101n 'Al\u0101n-d-d\u012bn, and proclaiming himself Shamsu-d-d\u012bn Bhangrah usurped the provinces of Lakhnauti and Bengal. The reign of Sult\u0101n 'Al\u0101n-d-d\u012bn lasted one year and five months.\n\n---\n\nREIGN OF HAJI ILYAS STYLED SULT\u0100N SHAMSU-D-D\u012aN.\n\nWhen Sult\u0101n 'Al\u0101n-d-d\u012bn was killed, and the sovereignty of Bengal passed to H\u0101ji Ily\u0101s 'Al\u0101, proclaiming himself Sult\u0101n Shamsu-d-d\u012bn he mounted the throne in the holy city of Pand\u016bah. As he took much bhang, he was called Shamsu-d-d\u012bn Bhangrah. In conciliating the people, and winning the heart of the army, he put forth noble efforts. After a while, mustering an army, he went to J\u0101jnagar, and from there obtaining many valuables and presents and large elephants, returned to his capital. And owing to the decay which had set in in the Empire of Delhi from the\n\n---\n\n1 Pand\u016bah is situate 12 miles north of English Bazar in Maldah district. From the beginning of the reign of Shamsuddin Ily\u0101s to the end of the reign of R\u0101jah Kans, six kings ruled there for a period of 52 years, from 743 to 795 A.H. But perhaps 'Ali Mub\u0101rik should also be included amongst the kings who ruled at Pand\u016bah. His reign appears to have commenced in 741 A.H. (1340 A.C.) Professor Blochmann calls Pand\u016bah 'Ali Shah's capital (J.A.S.B., XLII, 254) and Professor Blochmann's statement seems to be supported by the narrative of our author, viz., the statement about 'Ali Mub\u0101rik building a shrine of the saint Jal\u0101luddin at Pand\u016bah, and also about Shamsuddin Ily\u0101s's arrival at Pand\u016bah. In 795 A.H. (1392), king Jal\u0101luddin (son of R\u0101jah Kans) who became a Muhammadan, removed the capital back again to Gaur or Lakhnauti.\ntime of Sultan Muhammad Shah, for thirteen years the Emperors of Delhi did not turn their attention to Bengal. Sultan Shamsuddin with absolute independence devoted himself to the administrative affairs of Bengal, subjugated gradually all the tracts up to the limits of Banaras, and enhanced more than before his pomp and power, until the throne of Delhi passed to Firuz Shah, son\n\n1 Haji Ilyas first appears to have in 746 A.H. made himself master of Western Bengal, whilst at that time Ikhtiaruddin Abul Muzaffar Ghazi Shah (son of Mubarak Shah) still reigned at Sunargaon in Eastern Bengal. Haji Ilyas shortly after (753 A.H.) subdued Eastern Bengal also, and established himself at Sunargaon, and founded a dynasty which continued (with a brief break) to reign over Bengal till 896 A.H. or nearly a century and a half. He extended his western boundaries as far as Benares, founded Hajipur, and though Firuz Shah Tughlak the Emperor led an expedition into Bengal to punish him, he had to return unsuccessful. For Ilyas Shah's coinage, see Thomas's Initial Coinage of Bengal, J.A.S., 1867, pp. 57, 58.\n\nThe nearest contemporary account of this King will be found in Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi p. 586 by Ziauddin Barni and Siraj Afif p. 77.\n\n2 Sultan Firuz Shah Tughlak alias Malik Firuz Barbak was a son of an uncle of Muhammad Shah Tughlak, and a nephew of Ghiasuddin Tughlak Shah. His father was Rajab Salar who abandoning all worldly affairs, became a saint. When fifty years old, in 756 A.H., he was crowned as Emperor of Hindustan. He was a wise, noble and enlightened sovereign, He paid special attention to improvement of agriculture and of the economical condition of the country. He reformed the administration of justice, put down oppressions and corruption, lightly assessed land-revenue, and regulated its assessment according to the produce of the lands assessed and also according to the capacity of the tenantry to bear the assessment, and abolished octroi duties. He established thirty colleges, founded five hospitals and dispensaries, erected forty cathedral mosques and two hundred caravanserais, twenty monasteries, one hundred palaces and villas, and one hundred and fifty-two baths, and numerous gardens, and bridges. In the environs of Hansi, he erected a fort called Hisar-i-Firuz, and joined it by means of a canal with the river Jumna. His greatest work was the old Jumna canal; this canal drew its water from the Jumna, near a point where it leaves the mountains, and connected that river with the Ghaggar and the Sutlej by means of irrigation channels, spreading fertility all around. He caused the translation of several Sanskrit works into Persian, and encouraged learning and the learned. He was the recipient of a Royal investiture from Abul Fatah Khalif of Egypt. He reigned from 1351 to 88 A.C. The Tughlak dynasty ended in 1414 A.C., the Empire being shattered by the invasion of Timur in 1398 A.C., during the reign of Mahmud Shah Tughlak, the last real Tughlak king. (See Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi pp. 548-570 by Ziauddin Barni, and by Shams-i-Seraj).\nof Rajab, who attempted to re-conquer Bengal. It is said that at that time Sultan Shamsu-d-din built a bath, similar to the Shami bath of Delhi. Sultan Firuz Shah who was furious with anger against Shamsu-d-din, in the year 754 A.H., set out for Lakhnanti, and after forced marches reached close to the city of Panduah, which was then the metropolis of Bengal. The Emperor encamped at a place which is still called Firuzpurabad, and riding from that place besieged the Fort of Panduah. Sultan Shamsu-d-din leaving his son with an army in the fort of Panduah, entrenched himself in the fort of Ekdalah which was very impregnable. Firuz Shah, not oppressing the people of Panduah, captured in battle the son of Sultan Shamsu-d-din, and marched towards the fort of Ekdalah.\n\n(End of Fasc. I.)\n\n(Fasc. II.)\n\nOn the first day, a bloody engagement took place. After that, for twenty-two days, he besieged the Fort. Not succeeding, Firuz Shah resolved to transfer his camp to the bank\n\n1 Firuzabadpur is a mistake here for Firuzabad, close to Panduah.\n2 Mr. Westmacott places Ekdalah near Dinajpur, whilst Mr. Beveridge places it near Dacca. For a discussion on the site of the fort of Ekdalah, also see Blochmann's Contributions to History and Geography of Bengal, J.A.S., 1873, p. 213 and also Mr. Beveridge's Analysis of \"Khurshid Jah\u0101n Numa.\"\n\nIn Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi by Zia 'Barni, Ekdalah is described as follows (Pers. text, p. 588): \"Ekdalah is the name of a mouza close to Panduah; on one side of it is a river, and on another a jungle.\" Zia 'Barni is a contemporary historian for the period; therefore, this description given by him fixes the site of the Fort of Ekdalah near Panduah, and sets at rest all the speculations to the contrary raised by Mr. Beveridge (in his Analysis of Khurshid Jah\u0101n Numa) who fixes it near the Bhowal jungle in Dacca district, and also by Mr. Westmacott who would place it towards Dinajpur. Professor Blochmann is inclined to treat 'Ekdalah' as a generic name, referring to several places. See J.A.S.B. for 1873, pp. 212-213. Rennell gives another Ekdalah north of Dacca \"map of Hindustan.\" Shams-i-Siraj in his Tarikh-Firuz Shahi (Pers. text p. 79) calls it the \"isles of Ekdalah.\"\n\n3 The first expedition of Emperor Firuz Shah Tughlak into Bengal (in 754 A.H.=1353 A.C.) is fully and humorously described by Zia 'Barni, a contemporary historian, in the Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi (Pers. text, p. 586), who\nof the Ganges. Then, alone, he searched for a proper camping ground. Sultan Shamsu-d-din thinking that Firuz Shah closes his history with a narrative of this expedition and of the events up to the sixth year of Firuz Shah's reign. The object of the expedition was to punish Sultan Shamsu-d-din Haji Ilyas who had invaded and ravaged Tirhut and harried the frontier (then the Sro river) between the Bengal Kingdom and the Delhi Empire. The Emperor set out from Delhi on 10th Shawal 754 A.H., reached Oudh, crossed the Sro river, when Ilyas Shah withdrew to Tirhut. The Emperor crossing the Sro, marched through Arsa-i-Kharosah (not identified) and Gorakpur, the Rajahs whereof paid him homage and enlisted themselves on his side. Ilyas Shah then returned from Tirhut to Panduah, the Emperor following him towards Lakhnauti and Panduah, after traversing Jagat or Jakat (not identified) and Tirhut (the Rajahs whereof also paid homage to the Emperor). Ilyas Shah, on approach of the Emperor to Panduah, retired to Fort Ekdalah, where he entrenched himself. The Emperor did not plunder Panduah, but left its population unmolested, crossed the river in front of the fort Ekdalah, and laid siege to it for several days. He had scruples about destroying promiscuously the garrison of the Fort, so he made a feint retreating movement back across the river, which resulted in drawing out Ilyas Shah from the Fort. A battle was fought, the Bengal army in which elephants formed a prominent feature was defeated, and the Imperialists captured forty-four Bengal elephants, &c., &c. On finding that the rainy season was approaching, the Emperor by forced marches (after appointing Collectors in Tirhut district) returned to Delhi, which was reached on 12th Shaaban 755 A.H. or 1354 A.C.\n\nThis first expedition is also narrated by Shams Siraj Asfi, another nearly contemporary historian, who continued Barni's Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi. (See Pers. MSS., text p. 76). From this account, the following additional interesting facts are gleaned:\n\n1. That Firuz Shah sailed to Bengal in one thousand flotilla of war-vessels, and his route lay across the Sro, the Ganges and the Kosi rivers, that his expeditionary force consisted of 70,000 Khanans and Maluks, two laks infantry, 60,000 cavalry, besides an elephant-corps.\n\n2. That when Firuz Shah crossed the Kosi river, Ilyas Shah, king of Bengal, retired from Panduah to Ekdalah, which is called here the \"Isles of Ekdalah.\"\n\n3. That Firuz Shah laid siege to the fort of Ekdalah for several days, and nothing decisive occurring, made a feint retreating movement westward seven karoh or Kos from Ekdalah, when Ilyas Shah thinking Firuz Shah was retreating, came out of the fort Ekdalah, advanced, and attacked the Imperialists, who defeated and killed one lak of the Bengal army, and captured 50 Bengal elephants.\n\n4. That then Ilyas Shah escaped again to the Fort of Ekdalah, which was about to be stormed by the Imperialists, when the females of the garrison uncovering their heads, exhibited themselves, and raised loud lamentations,\nhad marched to retire, came out of the fort, and mustered his forces.\n\nOwing to the sword and the arrow and the spear and the gun,\nThe market of fighting became warm on both sides.\nThe bodies of heroes were emptied of their souls;\nLike roses, on their faces, budded forth wounds.\n\nAfter much slaughter on both sides, a large number of people were killed and destroyed. At length, the breeze of victory wafted on the standard of Firuz Sh\u00e2h, and Shamsu-d-din being overpowered fled, and sought refuge in the Fort. Forty-four elephants which he had brought from Jajnagar, together with the Royal Umbrella and the standard and other regal chattels and paraphernalia, fell into the hands of the soldiers of Firuz Sh\u00e2h. It is said that at that time the Saint Shaikh R\u00e2ja Biy\u00e2b\u00e2ni\\(^1\\) in whom Sult\u00e2n Shamsu-d-din had great faith, died. Sult\u00e2n Shamsu-d-din coming out of the Fort, in the guise of a mendicant, joined the Shaikh's funeral. After finishing the obsequies, he rode alone to see Firuz Sh\u00e2h, and without the latter recognizing him, returned to the Fort. When the Sult\u00e2n came to know about it, he expressed regret. In short, when the period of siege was protracted, and the rainy season set in, in that in the rains, the country of Bengal becomes one sheet of water, and cause for anxiety arises, Sult\u00e2n Firuz Sh\u00e2h made overtures for peace. Sult\u00e2n Sh\u00e2msu-d-din, who was hard-pressed by the siege, partially made his submission, and also sought for peace. Firuz Sh\u00e2h, releasing the son of Sult\u00e2n Sh\u00e2msu-d-din together with other prisoners of the kingdom of Lakhnauti, raised the standard of return. And in the year 755 A.H., Sult\u00e2n Sh\u00e2msu-d-din sent many presents and numerous rarities, in charge of wise envoys, to Sult\u00e2n Firuz Sh\u00e2h. The latter also showing attentions to the envoys, sent them back. And since Sult\u00e2n Sh\u00e2msu-d-din had which softened the heart of Firuz Sh\u00e2h, who abandoned the work of destruction.\n\n5. That before marching back towards Delhi, Firuz Sh\u00e2h halted for some days at Panduah, named it \"Firuzabad,\" introduced there the Kh\u00fbfbah after his own name, and also named \"Ekdalah\" \"Az\u00e2dpur.\"\n\n6. That Firuz Sh\u00e2h's expedition lasted eleven months.\n\n\\(^1\\) He died in 1353 A.C.

Firuz Sh\u0101h agreeing, returned the envoys loaded with honours. From that time, the boundaries between the Kingdoms of Delhi and Bengal were delimitated; and the Emperors of Delhi adhering to the terms of the treaty, never meddled with the Kings of Bengal, and by mutual exchange of presents on both sides, they maintained friendly relations between the two kingdoms. And in the year 758 A.H., Sult\u0101n Sh\u0101msu-d-din again sent from Bengal Malik T\u0101ju-d-din with some nobles, in the form of an embassy, with many presents and gifts to Delhi. Sult\u0101n Firuz Sh\u0101h bestowing attentions on the envoys more than before, after some days, sent in return to Sult\u0101n Sh\u0101msu-d-din Arab and Turkish horses, together with other valuable presents, in charge of Malik Saifu-d-din Sh\u0101hnafil. In the meantime, Sult\u0101n Sh\u0101msu-d-din had died in Bengal. Malik T\u0101ju-d-din and Malik Saifu-d-din had approached Behar, when they heard the news of the death of Sult\u0101n Sh\u0101msu-d-din. Malik Saifu-d-din communicated this intelligence to Delhi, and agreeably to the order of the Emperor, he gave away the horses and the presents in lieu of the pay due to the Imperial soldiers stationed in Behar. Malik T\u0101ju-d-din returned to Bengal. The reign of Sh\u0101msu-d-din lasted 16 years and some months.\n\n---\n\nTHE REIGN OF SIKANDAR SH\u0100H, SON OF SHAMSU-D-DIN.\n\nWhen Sult\u0101n Sh\u0101msu-d-din Bhangra passed away from this fleeting world, on the third day, with the consent of the nobles\n\n---\n\n1 Regarding coinage of Ily\u0101s Sh\u0101h, see Thomas's Initial Coinage of Bengal, J.A.S., 1867, pp. 57-58.\n\n\"Having in 746 become master of Western Bengal, Ily\u0101s Sh\u0101h in 753 A.H. established himself at Sunargaon, near Dacca, and thus founded a dynasty which with an exception of about forty years in the beginning of the ninth century of the Hijrah, continued to rule over Bengal till 886 A.H.\" (Blochmann's Contribution, J.A.S., 1878, p. 254).\n\nHis coins (see p. 58, J.A.S. for 1867), disclose the interesting fact that several of them were minted at Sunargaon (which is termed on the coins Hazrat Jallal Sunargaon or the Illustrious Royal Residence of Sunargaon), bearing dates A.H. 753, 754, 755, 756, 757, 758. His name on the coins is \"Shamsu-d-din Abdul Muzzaffar Ily\u0101s Sh\u0101h.\"\nand the generals, his eldest son, Sikandar Shah, ascended the throne of Bengal, and spreading the hem of justice and generosity on the heads of the people, proclaimed joyful tidings of peace and security. And deeming it expedient to conciliate Sultan Firuz Shah, he sent, in the shape of presents, fifty elephants with sundry rarities. In the meantime, Firuz Shah, Emperor of Delhi, in the year 760 A.H. marched to subjugate the kingdom of Bengal.\n\n1 The object of this second expedition of Emperor Firuz Shah into Bengal in 760 A.H. (1359 A.C.) was to reinstate Zafar Khan (son-in-law of Sultan Fakhru-d-din Mubarak Shah, king of Sunargaon) on the throne of Sunargaon. See details in Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi by Shams Siraj Afif (Pers. MS. text, p. 97). From it, it appears that the Musalman throne of Sunargaon was more ancient than the Musalman throne of Panduah, that on Firuz Shah's return from Bengal after his first expedition (this would necessitate a slight modification of Professor Blochmann's date in n: 1 ante p. 108) Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah sailed and reached Sunargaon in a few days. At that time (755 A.H. or 1354 A.C.) Sultan Fakhru-d-din was reigning in security at Sunargaon. Shamsuddin took him by surprise, captured and slew him, and usurped the Sunargaon Kingdom, in addition to his Kingdom of Lakhnauti and Panduah. At that time Zafar Khan, son-in-law of Fakhruddin who was touring out in the interior of Sunargaon, to collect revenue and to locally enquire into the conduct of collectors of revenue, heard the above news, sailed on a ship from Sunargaon by the ocean-route to Thatah and thence proceeded to Delhi, and sought help from Firuz Shah. Peace was concluded with Sikandar Shah, on the latter agreeing to reinstate Zafar Khan in the kingdom of Sunargaon\u2014which however did not come to pass, as Zafar Khan preferred to go back to Delhi. Like Ilyas Shah, Sikandar took refuge in the Fort of Ekdalah. From Bengal, Firuz Shah invaded Jajnagar (Orissa), defeated the Rajah who made his submission, carried off the idol of Jaganath to Delhi, (p. 119) and captured many elephants. The Emperor's stay in Bengal and Jajnagar during this expedition covered 2 years and 7 months (p. 121). In this connection, an interesting description of Jajnagar is given by Shams Siraj Afif (Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi, Pers. MS. text, p. 115, and in Muntakhibil Tawarikh (Pers. text, p. 247, Vol. I, Fasc. III, ). Bearing in mind what Zia 'Barni states regarding Jajnagar in connection with Emperor Balban's expedition to Sunargaon, I am inclined to agree with Professor Blochmann that there were two Jajnagars: one in Orissa, and another towards Tipperah. The account in Muntakhiba Tawarikh referred to above, is slightly different from that in Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi by Shams Seraj Afif. Badaoni in Muntakhib states that Firuz Shah after completing his second expedition into Bengal (760 A.H.) returned from Panduah by forced marches to Jaunpur (p. 247, Muntakhib Pers. text, Vol. I, Fasc. III), where he spent the rainy season, and that at the end of this year, by way of Behar, he marched into Jajnagar (Orissa), passing through Sathi-ghira, Baranasi, and crossing the Mahanadi river (the Rajah of Baranas\nWhen he reached Zafarabad,\u00b9 the rains setting in, the Emperor encamped there, and sent envoys to Sikandar Shah. Sikandar Shah was in anxiety about the aim of the Emperor of Delhi, when Firuz Shah's envoys arrived. Sikandar Shah immediately sent his aid-de-camp together with five elephants and other presents, and opened negotiations for peace; but these resulted in nothing. After the rainy season was over, Sultan Firuz Shah marched to Lakhnauti. When the Sultan encamped in the environs of Panduah, Sikandar Shah feeling that he was no match for the Sultan followed his father's tactics, and entrenched himself in the Fort of Ekdalah. Firuz Shah pressed the siege hard. When the garrison was reduced to straits, Sikandar Shah sending forty elephants together with other goods and presents and numerous rarities, and agreeing to pay an annual tribute, sought for peace. Firuz Shah accepting these returned to Delhi. After this for some years, Sikandar Shah with absolute independence gave full rein to enjoyments. And in the year 766 A.H., he built the Adina mosque;\u00b2 but before he could finish it, death overtook him; and the mosque remained half finished. Some trace of the mosque still exists in the jungles of Panduah, at a distance of one kroh from the town. The Author of this history has seen it.\n\n\u00b9 Zafarabad lies on the right bank of the Gumti, a little below Jaunpur, which lies on the left bank. The maps give instead \"Jaffarabad,\" which is a corruption of \"Zaffarabad.\" Zaffarabad is mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbari as a parganah in Sarkar Jaunpur under the Subah of Allahabad (Allahabad)\u2014Jarrett's Tr., Ain., Vol. II, p. 184.\n\n\u00b2 This beautiful mosque is at Panduah. Its inscription has been published in J.A.S.B., 1873, p. 257. The inscription was written in 770 A.H., (1369 A.C.)\ntruth, it is a beautiful mosque, and an enormous sum must have been expended on its erection. One ought to be thankful for his efforts. It is said that Sikandar Sh\u0101h had seventeen sons by his first wife, and by his second wife he had one son, named Ghi\u0101su-d-din, who, in polish of manners and other qualities, was superior to his other brothers, and was proficient in the art of government. Consequently, the first wife kindling the fire of envy and jealousy and wishing the destruction of Ghi\u0101su-d-din, sought for an opportunity to injure him. One day, finding an opportunity, she respectfully placed the hand on her chest, in the presence of the king, and desired to state her object. The king guessing from the manner of the wife said: \"Speak out what thou hast to say.\" The wife said: \"I would submit my prayer, if the king would take an oath to fulfil it and try his best to fulfil it.\" The king swore to fulfil it, and indulging in a bit of hyperbole said: \"Unbosom the desire that thou hast, and make thy lip the mirror of the dust of thy heart.\" The shrewd queen said: \"I am in great anxiety, in consequence of the conduct of Ghi\u0101su-d-din. He is scheming to mount the throne, by killing the king and destroying my sons. Although he is in the position of a son to me, and I do not wish that he should be killed, yet as the safeguarding of the life of the king is incumbent, you should not let slip from the hand the rein of alertness, but provide previously against any mishap. The best course would be that you should imprison him, or blind his eyes.\" The king on hearing this became perturbed, and said, \"What is this aim of thine which thou hast mingled with the liquid of my welfare?, and what is this fire of envy that thou hast mixed with solicitude for me? Thou feelest no shame that thou hast seventeen sons, whilst the other frail lady has only this one son. What you do not like for yourself, do not desire unto others.\" The queen again anxiously said: \"Envy and jealousy have nothing to do with my suggestion. The duty that I thought incumbent upon myself in the interests of thy well-being, I have discharged; after this, my sovereign is at liberty to do what he pleases.\" The king putting the padlock of silence on the portal of the tongue, kept quiet, and said within himself, \"As Ghi\u0101su-d-din is a dutiful son and possesses capacity for ruling, even if he seeks to take my life, let it be so! Happy it is, if the son is dutiful. But if he is undutiful, may he perish!\" After this, he\nput the reins of authority entirely into the hands of Sultan Ghi\u0101su-d-din. But Ghi\u0101su-d-din, who suspected always the wiles and stratagems of the queen, one day on the pretext of hunting escaped towards Sun\u0101rg\u0101on, and in a short time mobilising a large army, demanded the throne from his father. Shortly after, in order to wrest the kingdom, he marched with a large army from Sun\u0101rg\u0101on, and encamped at Sun\u0101rgadhi. From the other side, the father also with a powerful army advanced. On the next day, on the battlefield of Go\u0101lp\u0101ra, both sides marshalling their forces prepared to fight.\n\nThe son shewed malice towards the father:\nBlood flowed from the perturbed heart.\nThe father snapped the ties of kindness and affection:\nYou might say that love had vanished from the world.\n\nAlthough Ghi\u0101su-d-din had given strict orders to his soldiers and commanders that to the utmost they should capture the king alive, but as fate willed otherwise, Sikandar Sh\u0101h was unknowingly killed at the hands of one of the commanders of Ghi\u0101su-d-din. Whilst still the slayer was standing at his head, one amongst them seeing Sikandar Sh\u0101h killed, enquired as to who had killed him. He said: \"I have killed him;\" the other man said, \"You felt no pity for Sultan Sikandar.\" Then both in fright went to Ghi\u0101su-d-din and said: \"In case we fear that by restraining our hands, we may be killed, can we kill him?\" Ghi\u0101su-d-din said: \"Certainly you may kill him,\" and after some reflection he said: \"Apparently, thou hast killed the king.\" The slayer said: \"Yes, unknowingly I inflicted a cut with the spear on the heart of the king. Still he has some remnants of life.\" Ghi\u0101su-d-din proceeded swiftly, dismounted from the horse, and placed the head of the father on his lap, and tears trickled down his cheek, and he said: \"Father, open thy eyes, and express thy dying\n\n1 Not identified, but it must have been close to Sunargaon.\n2 Identified by Professor Blochmann to be a village quite close to Panduah, S.W. of it (J.A.S., 1873, p. 256). But Dr. Wise in his interesting \"Notes on Sunargaon\" (J.A.S. for 1874, p. 85) correctly places it near Jafargunj in Dhaka district, and nearly opposite to the junction of the Ganges and the Javana. \"Eight years ago,\" says Dr. Wise, \"Sikandar Shah's tomb was pointed out in the above neighbourhood.\"\nwish, that I may fulfil it.\" The king opened his eyes, and said:\n\"My life's work is over; the kingdom is welcome to thee.\n\nMay you prosper in your sovereignty,\nAs I have quitted the world.\"\n\nAfter he said this, the bird of his soul flew away. Ghi\u0101\u1e63u-d-d\u012bn seeing no good in tarrying further, left behind some nobles to attend to the obsequies of his father, and himself rode forward towards Panduah, and ascended the throne. The reign of Sikandar Sh\u0101h\u00b9 lasted nine years and some months. He was a contemporary of the saint 'Ala'ul Haq.\u00b2\n\n---\n\nTHE REIGN OF GHI\u0100SU-D-D\u012aN,\u00b3 SON OF SIKANDAR SH\u0100H.\n\nWhen Sikandar Sh\u0101h was laid in the grave, the throne of Bengal received eclat from the accession of Sultan Ghi\u0101\u1e63u-d-d\u012bn. First blinding the eyes of his step-brothers, he sent them to their mother, and freed himself from anxiety as to the wiles of his brothers. After this, he commenced dispensing justice, and throughout his life lived at rest and ease. It is related that once Sultan Ghi\u0101\u1e63u-d-d\u012bn falling seriously ill despaired of life, and selected three maids from his harem, one named Sarv, the\n\n\u00b9 For his coinage see Thomas's Initial Coinage (J.A.S., 1867, pt. II). His name from coins (see pp. 65-67 J.A.S., 1867), appears to be \"Abul Majahid Sikandar Sh\u0101h.\" Some of his coins are of Sunargaon mint.\n\u00b2 Shaikh 'Alauddin Alau'l Haq died on the 1st Rajab, 800 A.H. or 20th March, 1398, and his tomb is at Panduah. A short biographical sketch of this saint is given by Professor Blochmann in J.A.S.B., p. 262 for 1873. His son and successor was Shaikh Nuruddin Nur Qutb Alam who died in 861 A.H. or 1447 A.C., and lies buried at Panduah. Nur Qutb Alam was succeeded by his sons Rafiuddin and Shaikh Anwar.\n\u00b3 On the coins, he is called \"Ghi\u0101suddin Ab\u016bl Muzaffar Azam Sh\u0101h.\" (See Thomas's Initial Coinage of Bengal, J.A.S. for 1867, pp. 68-69). His early coins were minted at Muazzamabad in Eastern Bengal, and he held court at Sunargaon, during the lifetime of his father, Sikandar Sh\u0101h; against whom he rebelled. His court was an asylum for the learned and the cultured, and he was himself a just and righteous sovereign, and a man of light and sweetness. He invited the illustrious Persian poet Hafiz to his court. His tomb is at Sunargaon (See pl. 8 in J.A.S. 1874, p. 85.)\nsecond named Gul, and the third named Lalah, to perform the last bathing ceremony. When God granted him recovery, considering them auspicious he bestowed attentions on them more than before. The other maids from envy used to taunt them about the bathing, so that one day whilst the king was in a jolly mood, they related to him this affair. The king recited the following line\u2014\n\n\u0633\u0627\u062a\u06cc - \u062d\u0628\u06cc\u0628 \u0633\u0631\u0648\u06a9\u0644 \u0648 \u0644\u0627\u0644\u0647 \u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0648\u062f\n\n\"Cup-bearer, this is the story of Sarv (the cypress) Gul (the Rose) and Lalah (the Tulip\"). \n\nThe second line of the verse could not be supplied, and none of the poets attached to court could supply it.

For instance, it is related that one day whilst at arrow-shooting, the king\u2019s arrow accidentally hit a widow\u2019s son. The widow sought for redress from Qazi Siraju-d-din. The Qazi was in anxiety; for if he showed partiality towards the king, he would be held culpable before the tribunal of God, and if he did not do so, the summoning of the king would be a difficult affair. After much deliberation, he sent a peon to summon the king, and himself sat on the tribunal of justice, placing a whip underneath the masnad. When the Qazi\u2019s peon reached the palace, finding access to the king impossible, he commenced shouting out the call to prayer (Azan). The king hearing this untimely call to prayer, ordered the Muazzin (caller to prayer) to be brought to his presence. When the Royal servants carried the latter to the royal presence, the king enquired as to this untimely call to prayer. He (peon) said: \u201cQazi Siraju-d-din has deputed me, in order that I may take the king to the tribunal of justice. Since access to the king was difficult, I adopted this device to obtain access. Now get up, and come to the tribunal. The widow\u2019s son whom you wounded with an arrow, is the complainant.\u201d The king immediately got up, and concealing a small sword under his arm-pit, set out. When he appeared before the Qazi, the latter not at all paying attention to the king, said: \u201cConsolate the heart of this old woman.\u201d The king consoled her in a way that he could, and said: \u201cQazi, now the old woman is satisfied.\u201d Then the Qazi turning to the old woman enquired, \u201cHave you received redress and been satisfied?\u201d The woman said: \u201cYes, I am satisfied.\u201d Then the Qazi got up in great delight, and showing respect to the king, seated him on the masnad. The king drawing out the sword from his arm-pit said: \u201cQazi, in obedience to the injunctions of the sacred Law, I have appeared at your tribunal. If today I found you deviating by one hair-breadth from adherence to the injunctions of the Law, with this very sword I should have severed your head. God be thanked, that everything has been all-right.\u201d The Qazi also drew his whip from underneath the masnad, and said: \u201cSire, if today I found thee in the least transgressing the injunctions of the sacred\n\n1 Commutation or compounding of certain offences is permitted by the Muhammadan Law, as is also permitted (though to a more limited extent) by the present English Criminal Procedure Law of India.\nLaw, by God, with this very whip I should have turned your back red and black\" and added\u2014\n\n\"A calamity had come but has ended well.\" The king, being pleased, bestowing gifts and presents on the Q\u0101zi, returned. The king from the beginning had great faith in the Saint Nur Qutubul \u2018Alam, and was his contemporary and fellow-student; for both took their lessons from Shaikh Hamidu-d-din Kunjua-shin Nagori. At length, in the year 775 A.H., by the stratagems of Rajah K\u0101ns who was a zemindar in that part, the king was treacherously killed. The reign of Ghi\u0101\u1e63u-d-din lasted seven years and some months, and according to another account, it lasted sixteen years, five months and three days.\n\n---\n\nREIGN OF SAIFU-D-DIN STYLED SULT\u0100NU-S-SALAT\u012aN.\n\nWhen Sult\u0101n Ghi\u0101\u1e63u-d-din passed from the narrow human frame into the wide space of the soul, the nobles and the generals\n\n1 This story speaks volumes in favour of the purity of the administration of justice that must have prevailed in the latter part of the fourteenth century under the Musalman r\u00e9gime in Bengal. History fails to furnish an instance that can surpass this, in exemplifying the honesty and sense of duty of a humble peon, the judicial fearlessness and integrity of a judge, and the law-abiding nature of a king.\n\n2 Shaikh Hamid of Nagor belonged to Nagor in Jodhpur.\n\n3 For Coinage of this King, see Thomas\u2019s Initial Coinage, J.A.S.B., 1867, pp. 68-70.\n\nFrom the circumstance that his early coins were struck at the mint-town of Muazzamabad (territory whereof has been identified to have extended from the Megna to north-eastern Maimansingh and the right bank of the Surma), it would appear that he first acquired power in Eastern Bengal, and reigned, first at Sunargaon, from which place according to the Riyaz he marched out to fight against his father, Sikandar Sh\u0101h, who reigned at Pandnah. Sult\u0101n Ghi\u0101\u1e63u-d-din must have invited Hafiz to his court at Sunargaon, (as Hafiz died in 791 A.H.), when, according to Sikandar Sh\u0101h\u2019s coins noticed by Mr. Thomas, Sikandar Sh\u0101h yet ruled at Pandnah. (See also J.A.S. for 1873, p. 258).\n\n4 On the coins he is called Saifu-d-din Abul Majahid Hamzah Sh\u0101h, son of Azam Sh\u0101h (see J.A.S. for 1873, p. 259). Ferishta says: \"The Rajahs of the country did not draw their heads out of the yoke of obedience, and did not\nof the army placed his son, Saifu-d-din, on the paternal throne styling him Sult\u0101n-u-s-Sal\u0101tin.\n\nOne goes out, and another comes in in his place:\nThe world is never left without a master.\n\nHe was sober in character, and generous and brave. He reigned over Bengal for ten years, and in the year 785 A.H. he died, and according to another account, he reigned three years and seven months and five days. God knows the truth.\n\n---\n\nREIGN OF SHAMSU-D-DIN, SON OF SULT\u0100NU-S-SAL\u0100T\u012aN.\n\nAfter the death of Sult\u0101nu-s-Sal\u0101tin, his son, Shamsu-d-din, with the consent of the councillors and members of Government, ascended the throne, and according to ancient usages he observed the ceremonies attendant on assumption of sovereignty, and for a period was at ease and comfort. In the year 788 A.H. either by some natural disease, or by the stratagem of Rajah K\u0101ns, who at that time had become very powerful, he died. Some have written that this Shamsu-d-din was not an actual but adopted son of Sult\u0101nu-s-Sal\u0101tin, and that his name was Shah\u0101bu-d-din. Either way, he reigned for three years, four months, and six days. And the true account is, that Rajah K\u0101ns who was zamind\u0101r of Bathuriah attacking him, slew him, and usurped the throne.\n\nneglect or delay in paying revenue to him.\u201d According to the Tabaqat, he reigned 10 years. The coins discovered of him, were struck at Firuzabad (or Panduah).\n\n1 Ferihta says, that as the king was young and weak in intellect, an infidel named Rajah K\u0101ns, who was attached to the court, usurped the executive and collection of taxes. The Tabaqat says that the king died after a quiet and peaceful reign of three years and a few months.\n\nProfessor Blochmann identifies this king (whose coins have not been discovered) with king Shahabu-d-din Ab\u016bl Muzaffar Bayazid Sh\u0101h, whose coins are noticed by Professor Blochmann in J.A.S., p. 263, for 1873. Bayazid Sh\u0101h, according to Professor Blochmann\u2019s theory, was \u201ca puppet king\u2014a benami transaction,\u201d whilst Rajah K\u0101ns ruled over Bengal.\n\n2 Professor Blochmann says (J.A.S.B., p. 263 for 1873):\n\n\u201cThe name of Bhaturiah does not occur in the Ain, nor have I seen it before the time of Rennel\u2019s Atlas (1778) in which the name of Bhaturiah is\nUSURPATION OF RAJAH K\u0100NSI ZAMINDAR.\n\nWhen Sult\u0101n Shamsu-d-din died, Rajah K\u0101ns a Hind\u016b Zamindar, subjugating the whole kingdom of Bengal, seated himself on the throne, and commenced oppressions, and seeking to destroy the Musalmans, slew many of their learned and holy men. His aim was to extirpate Isl\u0101m from his dominions. It is said one day Shaikh Badrul Isl\u0101m, father of Shaikh Muinu-d-din \u2018Abbas, sat down before that wretch, without saluting him. Thereupon he said: \u201cShaikh, why did you not salute me?\u201d The Shaikh said: \u201cIt is not becoming for the learned to salute infidels, especially a cruel and blood-shedding infidel, like thee, who has shed the blood of Musalmans.\u201d On hearing this, that unholy infidel kept silent, and, coiling like the serpent, aimed at killing him. One day he sat in a house which had a low and narrow entrance, and summoned in the Shaikh. When the Shaikh arrived, he guessed the Rajah\u2019s object, so he first put out his legs inside, and afterwards not bending the head, entered. That\n\ngiven to a large district east of Maldah, bounded in the west by the Mahananda river and the Purnabhaba, its tributary, in the south by the left bank of the Ganges, in the east by the Karataya, and in the north by Dinajpur and Ghoraghat. Bhaturiah therefore is the district to both sides of the Atrai river.\u201d Professor Blochmann (J.A.S.B. for 1875, p. 287), identifies \u201cBhaturiah\u201d as part of old Barendra, in Rajshahi proper, between Amr\u016bl and Bagura, and signifying Northern Rajshahi Proper including Tahirpur. Professor Blochmann also considers, that the name \u201cRajshahi\u201d is connected with Rajah K\u0101ns, who was a Rajah-Sh\u0101h, that is, a Hindu Rajah who ascended a Musalman throne.\n\n1 The Tabaqat-i-Akbari merely notices K\u0101ns\u2019s usurpation. Ferishta says that though not a Musalman, K\u0101ns was a friend (Sic.) of Musalmans. The Riyaz gives the best account, based perhaps on local traditions. Mr. Westmacott inaccurately identifies \u201cRajah K\u0101ns\u201d of Bhathuriah with Rajah Ganesh of Dinajpur.\u201d Professor Blochmann (I think correctly) identifies \u201cRajah K\u0101ns\u201d with \u201cRajah K\u0101ns Narayan\u201d of Tahirpur which latter is included in Bhathuriah. (See J.A.S.B., p. 287 for 1875).\n\nRajah K\u0101ns does not appear to have issued coins in his own name, but during his r\u00e9gime, posthumous coins of Azam Sh\u0101h (noticed by Hon\u2019ble Sir E. C. Bayley in J.A.S., 1874, p. 294b.) and coins in the name of Shahabudin Bayazid Sh\u0101h, a puppet king or a benami king (noticed by Professor Blochmann in J.A.S.B. for 1873, p. 263), were issued.\n\nRajah K\u0101ns from the testimony of coins appears to have reigned from 810 A.H. to 817 A.H. or 1407 to 1414 A.C. but he appears to have actually usurped the government earlier in 808 A.H.\ninfidel flew into rage, and ordered that the Shaikh should be placed in a line with his brothers. Immediately, the Shaikh was killed, and the rest of the learned that very day were placed on a boat and drowned in the river. The Saint N\u00fbr Qutb\u00fb-l-'\u00c2lam becoming impatient by reason of the oppressions of that infidel and his slaughter of the Musalmans, wrote as follows to Sultan Ibrahim Sharqi who ruled at that time up to the limits of Behar:\n\n\"The ruler of this country, named K\u00e2ns, is an infidel. He is committing oppressions, and shedding blood. He has killed many of the learned and holy men, and destroyed them. At present, he is aiming to kill the remainder of the Musalmans, and to extirpate Isl\u00e2m from this country. Since to help and protect Musalmans, is a duty incumbent on Musalman sovereigns, accordingly I intrude on your valuable time with these few lines. I pray for your auspicious arrival here, for the sake of the residents of this country, and also in order to oblige me, so that Musalmans may be rescued from the oppressive load of this tyrant. Peace\n\n1 Shamsu-d-din Ibrahim Shah Sharqi, king of Jaunpur, reigned from 804 to 845 A.H. (1401-1441 A.C.) The Sharqi kingdom was created in 795 A.H. by Sultan Mahmud, son of Sultan Alauddin Sikandar Shah, son of Sultan Muhammad, son of Sultan Firuz Shah Tughluk, owing to the increasing feebleness of the Delhi Empire. The Sharqi kingdom, extended from Qanuj to Behar. Mahmud first bestowed the title of Sultan-us-Sharqi on Malik Sarwar, a eunuch who already held the title of Khajah-Jahan.\n\nThe following table will be useful:\n\n| Name          | A.H. | A.C. |\n|---------------|------|------|\n| Khajah Jahan  | 800  | 1397 |\n| Mubarak Shah  | 803  | 1400 |\n| Shamsu-d-din Ibrahim Shah | 804 | 1401 |\n| Mahmud Shah   | 845  | 1441 |\n| Muhammad Shah | 856  | 1451 |\n| Husain        | 856  | 1461 |\n\nThe last took refuge in the court of Alau-d-din Husain Shah, king of Bengal about 900 A.H. or 1497 B.C. Jaunpur continued to be governed by the Lodi dynasty till the defeat and death of Ibrahim, grandson of Bahadur Khan at Panipat by Babar in 1526 A.C. A local kingdom was for a short time established under Bahadur Khan, governor of Behar; it was recovered by Humayun, passed again into the hands of Sher Shah and his son Salim Shah. Jaunpur continued under the Afghans until Akbar in the 4th year of his reign took possession of it through Ali Quli Khan. In 1575, the Vice-regal court was removed to Allahabad, and Jaunpur was thenceforth governed by a Nazim.\u2014See Jarrett's Tr. of Ain, Vol II, pp. 169-170, and also Badaoni, Vol. I, pp. 264, 272, 273, 316, 307, Pers. text.\nbe on you.\u201d When this letter reached Sult\u0101n Ibrahim, the latter opened it with great respect, and read it. Q\u0101z\u012b Shah\u0101bu-d-d\u012bn Jaunpuri who was one of the scholars of the time, and the chief of the body of the learned men, and who was highly respected by Sult\u0101n Ibrahim who used to seat him on a silver chair on auspicious occasions, also used his great persuasions and said: \u201cYou ought to set out quickly; for in this invasion both worldly and religious benefits are to be obtained, namely the country of Bengal will be subjugated, and you would also meet the Saint Shaikh N\u016br Qu\u1e6db-u-l-\u02bf\u0100lam, who is the fountain-head of both worldly and eternal boons, and you would also be doing a pious deed by avenging the oppression of Mu\u1e25ammadans.\u201d Sult\u0101n Ibr\u0101h\u012bm pitching out his tents struck the kettle-drum of march, and making forced marches, in a short time, with a powerful army reached Bengal, and encamped at Firuzpur. Rajah K\u0101ns, on hearing this news, was confounded, and hastened to wait on the Saint Qu\u1e6db-u-l-\u02bf\u0100lam. Showing submissiveness and humility, and weeping, the Rajah said: \u201cPray, draw the pen of forgiveness across the page of the offences of this sinner, and dissuade Sult\u0101n Ibr\u0101h\u012bm from subjugating this country.\u201d The Saint replied: \u201cIn order to intercede on behalf of an oppressive infidel, I cannot stand in the way of a Musalman sovereign, especially of one who has come out at my desire and request.\u201d In despair, K\u0101ns prostrated his head on the feet of the Saint, and added, \u201cWhatever the Saint may bid, I am willing to submit thereto.\u201d The Saint said: \u201cSo long as thou dost not embrace the Musalman religion, I cannot intercede for thee.\u201d K\u0101ns assented to this condition, but his wife casting that misguided man into the well of misguidance, prevented his conversion to Isl\u0101m. At length, K\u0101ns brought to the presence of the Saint his son named Jad\u016b who was twelve years old, and said: \u201cI have become old, and desire to retire from the world. You may convert to Isl\u0101m this\n\n1 \u201cQ\u0101z\u012b Shah\u0101bu-d-d\u012bn, a sage of Hindustan, flourished in the time (of Ibrahim Sh\u0101h). He was born at Delhi and in that city acquired a comprehensive knowledge of the inductive sciences and traditional lore, and at the time of the arrival of Timur, he set out for Jaunpur in the company of his master Maulana Khwaj\u012bg\u012b who was the successor of Nasiru-d-d\u012bn Cher\u0101gh of Delhi, and then continued his progress and became the envy of his time.\u201d\u2014Ain-i-Akbari (Jarrett\u2019s Tr., Vol. II, pp. 169-170).\n\n2 i.e., Pandu\u1e47ah.\nson of mine, and then bestow on him the kingdom of Bengal.\" The saint Qutb-u-l-'Alam taking out from his own mouth some chewed betel, put it into Jad\u016b's mouth, and making him pronounce the creed of the Musalman faith, converted him to Isl\u0101m, and naming him Jal\u0101lu-d-din, had the fact proclaimed in the city, and caused the Kh\u016bfba of the kingdom to be recited after his name. The ordinances of the sacred Muhammadan law from that day were again put in force. After this, the saint Qutb-u-l-'Alam went to meet Sult\u0101n Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, and after making apologies, prayed that the latter might withdraw. The Sult\u0101n was annoyed at this request, and turned his face towards Qazi Shah\u0101bu-d-din. The Qazi said: \"Saint, the king has come here at your requisition; and now you yourself siding with K\u0101ns, appear as his agent; what is your aim?\" The Saint said: \"At that time (when I made the requisition) an oppressive ruler was tyrannising over the Musalmans; now owing to the auspicious arrival of the Sult\u0101n, he has embraced the Muhammadan faith. The Jih\u0101d (or holy war) is enjoined against infidels, not against Musalmans.\" The Q\u0101zi, finding no answer, kept quiet. But as the Sult\u0101n's temper was irritated, in order to soothe the Sult\u0101n, the Q\u0101zi commenced testing the learning and miracles of the saint, and was discomfitted. After much questions and answers, the Saint said: \"To view with contempt saints and to try to test them, ends in nothing but discomfiture. Before long, thou shalt die in a wretched plight.\" And the saint at the same time cast an angry glance towards the Sult\u0101n. In short, the Sult\u0101n, annoyed and vexed, returned to Jaunp\u016br. It is said that shortly after Sult\u0101n Ibr\u0101h\u012bm and Q\u0101zi Shah\u0101bu-d-din Jaunpuri died.\n\n'Whoever quarrels with saints, suffers.'\n\nRajah K\u0101ns hearing that Sult\u0101n Ibr\u0101h\u012bm had died, displaced Sult\u0101n Jal\u0101lu-d-din, and himself re-ascended the throne. According to the injunctions of his false creed, the Rajah prepared several gold-figures of cows, shoved in Jal\u0101lu-d-din through their mouths, and pulled him out from their buttock-sides, and then distributed the gold of those cow-figures among the Brahmans, and thus re-perverted his son to his own creed. As Jal\u0101lu-d-din, however, had been converted by the Saint Qutb-u-l-'Alam, he did not abandon his faith in Isl\u0101m, and the persuasions of the infidels had no effect.\non his heart. And Rajah K\u0101ns again unfurling the standard of misbehaviour, attempted to destroy and extirpate Muhammadans. When his cruelties passed all bounds, one day Shaikh Anw\u0101r, son of the Saint Qutb-u-l-\u2018\u0100lam, complained to his father of the oppressions of that tyrant, and said: \u201cIt is a matter of regret that in spite of such a holy saint of the time as yourself, Musalmans should be oppressed and ground down by the hand of this infidel.\u201d The saint at that time was absorbed in prayer and devotion. On hearing this utterance of his son, the saint was enraged, and replied: \u201cThis tyranny shall cease only, when thy blood shall be shed on the earth.\u201d Shaikh Anw\u0101r knew full well that whatever fell from the lips of his holy father, was sure to come to pass, and so after a moment, said: \u201cWhat you have said about me, is meet and proper; but in respect of my nephew, Shaikh Z\u0101hid, what is your will?\u201d The saint said: \u201cThe drum of the virtues of Z\u0101hid shall resound till resurrection-day.\u201d In short, Rajah K\u0101ns extending more than before his oppressions and cruelties, gradually oppressed the servants and dependants of the saint himself, plundered their effects and chattels, imprisoned Shaikh Anw\u0101r and Shaikh Z\u0101hid. As he had heard the Saints\u2019 prophecy about Shaikh Z\u0101hid, not daring to kill him, he banished both to Sun\u0101rg\u0101on, and sent orders to his agents there, that after ascertaining from them the whereabouts of the hidden treasures of their fathers and grandfathers, they should slay both. And on the Shaikh\u2019s arrival at Sun\u0101rg\u0101on, they perpetrated many cruelties, yet not finding any clue to the hidden treasures which did not exist, first they murdered Shaikh Anw\u0101r, and when they attempted to take the life of Shaikh Z\u0101hid, the latter stated that in a certain village a large cauldron was hidden. When they dug it up, they found a large chatty, but did not find more than one gold coin in it. They enquired, \u201cWhat has become of the rest?\u201d Z\u0101hid said: \u201cApparently some one has stolen it.\u201d And this affair was the outcome of a miracle. It is said that on the very day and at the very moment when Anw\u0101r was murdered at Sun\u0101rg\u0101on, and his sacred blood shed on the earth, Rajah K\u0101ns passed away from his sovereignty to hell. According to some accounts, his son, Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn, who was in prison leagued with his father\u2019s servants, and slew him. The rule and tyranny of that heathen lasted seven years.\nTHE REIGN OF JALALU-D-DIN, SON OF RAJAH KANS.\n\nAfter this, Jal\u0101lu-d-din mounted the throne with full independence. He converted, contrary to his father, many infidels to the Moslem faith, and compelled the Hind\u016bs who had tasted of the gold-made figures of cows, to eat beef. And calling back the saint Shaikh Z\u0101hid from Sun\u0101rg\u0101on, he paid him every respect and honour, and rendering him services, was very often in attendance on him. He managed the affairs of Government in an efficient manner. In his reign, people passed their lives in ease and comfort. It is said that in his time the town of Panduah became so populous that it cannot be described. At Gaur, he erected a mosque, a reservoir, the Jal\u0101li tank and a caravanserai. The city of Gaur commenced being re-populated in his time. He reigned for seventeen years. In the year 812 A.H., he removed the capital back again to Gaur. To this day, a large tower exists over his mausoleum at Panduah. The graves of his wife and his son lie by the sides of his mausoleum.\n\nREIGN OF AHMAD SHAH, SON OF JALALU-D-DIN.\n\nWhen Sult\u0101n Jal\u0101lu-d-din was laid in the grave, his son Ahmad Sh\u0101h, with the consent of the nobles and the generals of the army, ascended the throne, in succession to his father. As he was very peevish, oppressive and blood-thirsty, he shed blood for\n\n---\n\n1 He is described in coins (see J.A.S.B., p. 267, for 1873), as Jal\u0101lu-d-din Abul Muzaffar Muhammad Sh\u0101h. His reign probably lasted from 817 to 834 A.H. (1413 to 1430 A.C.) Some of his coins were struck at the mint-town of Sunargaon. He resided at Panduah, but in 822 A.H. built a Palace at Gaur, and shifted his residence to the latter place. Panduah also became very populous in his time.\n\n2 The date is a mistake for 822 A.H.\n\n3 His name as appearing on his coins is Shamsu-d-din Ab\u016bl Mujahid Ahmad Sh\u0101h. He reigned for 16 years from 834 to 850 A.H. (that is 1430\u20131446 A.C.)\n\nThe Tabaqat states that he reigned for sixteen years, and died in 830 A.H. Stewart says he reigned for eighteen years. Ferishta says he was a good and generous king, whilst Riyaz states he was a tyrant. With Ahmad Sh\u0101h ended the dynasty of Rajah K\u0101ns, and commenced the restoration of the Ily\u0101s Shahi dynasty. (See J.A.S.B. for 1878, p. 268).\nnothing, and used to cut open the bodies of pregnant women. When his oppressions reached the utmost limits, and the low and the high were exasperated to desperation by his tyranny, Sh\u0101di Kh\u0101n and N\u0101\u1e63ir Kh\u0101n who were his two slaves and held the rank of nobles intrigued, and killed Ahmad Sh\u0101h; and this event occurred in 830 A.H. His reign lasted sixteen years, and according to another account, eighteen years.\n\n---\n\nREIGN OF N\u0100\u1e62IR KH\u0100N, THE SLAVE.\n\nWhen the throne became vacant by the murder of Ahmad Sh\u0101h, Sh\u0101di Kh\u0101n desired to put N\u0101\u1e63ir Kh\u0101n out of the way and to become himself the Administrator-General of the kingdom. N\u0101\u1e63ir Kh\u0101n, guessing his design, forestalled him, and slew Sh\u0101di Kh\u0101n, and boldly placing himself on the throne, commenced to enforce orders. The nobles and the Mal\u016bk of Ahmad Sh\u0101h not submitting to him, slew him. His reign lasted seven days, and according to another account, half a day.\n\n---\n\nREIGN OF N\u0100\u1e62IR SH\u0100H.\u00b9\n\nWhen N\u0101\u1e63ir Kh\u0101n the slave in retribution for his misdeeds was killed, the nobles and the generals leaguing together, raised to the throne one of the grand-sons of Sult\u0101n Shamsu-d-d\u012bn Bhangra who had capacity for this onerous charge, styling him\n\n\u00b9 His name, as appearing on his coins, is N\u0101\u1e63iru-d-d\u012bn Abul Muzaffar Mahm\u016bd Sh\u0101h. With him commenced the restoration of the Ily\u0101s Sh\u0101hi dynasty in Bengal. He reigned for thirty-two years in peace (this peace being probably due to the wars that then prevailed between Jaunpur and Delhi), and according to another account for 'not more than twenty-seven years,' and died in A.H. 862. In the histories, he is simply called N\u0101\u1e63ir Sh\u0101h. Dates of his reign, as ascertained from coins and inscriptions, are 846; 861; 863; whilst the earliest dates ascertained for the reign of Barbak Sh\u0101h, Mahm\u016bd Sh\u0101h's successor, is 865. Mahm\u016bd Sh\u0101h therefore must have reigned till the beginning of 864 A.H. If his reign lasted twenty-seven years, this would put back the commencement of his reign to 836 (the year in which Marsden's Ahmad Shahi's coin was struck), and render Mahm\u016bd Sh\u0101h an opposition king during 14 years of Ahmad Sh\u0101h's reign which is doubtful. Inscriptions of this king from Satgaon, Dacca, and Gaur have been published. (See J.A.S. for 1873, pp. 269, 271 and for 1872, p. 108).\nN\u0101\u1e63ir Sh\u0101h. N\u0101\u1e63ir Sh\u0101h conducted himself with justice and liberality, so that the people, both young and old, were contented, and the wounds of oppression inflicted by Ahmad Sh\u0101h were healed. The buildings of Gaur and the Fort there, were erected by this high-ranked king. Reigning thirty-two years over Bengal, he passed away like others before him from the world, and according to another account, his reign did not exceed twenty-seven years.\n\n---\n\nREIGN OF BARBAK SH\u0100H, SON OF N\u0100\u1e62IRU-D-DIN.\n\nWhen N\u0101\u1e63ir Sh\u0101h died, his son Barbak Sh\u0101h mounted the throne. He was a sagacious and law-abiding sovereign. In his time, the soldiers were happy and contented, and he also spent his life in comfort and ease. He died in 879 A.H. His reign lasted seventeen or sixteen years.\n\n---\n\nREIGN OF Y\u016aSUF SH\u0100H.\n\nAfter the death of Barbak Sh\u0101h, his son Y\u016bsuf Sh\u0101h with the consent of the nobles and the \u00e9lite of the kingdom ascended the throne. He was a sovereign of gentle temperament, solicitous for the welfare of his subjects, and virtuous and learned and pious. He reigned seven years and six months, and died in 887 A.H.\n\n1 The coins do not give his full name, which however appears from inscriptions (J.A.S.B. for 1873, p. 272), to have been Ruknu-d-din Abul Mujahid Barbak Sh\u0101h. His reign commenced in 864 A.H., and as appears from the Tribeni inscriptions (published by Professor Blochmann in J.A.S.B. for 1870, p. 290), before that, he ruled as Governor of South-Western Bengal in 860 A.H. The Dinajpur inscription (published by Mr. Westmacott in J.A.S. for 1873, p. 272), proves that Barbak Sh\u0101h undoubtedly reigned as king in Bengal in 865 A.H. (1460 A.C.)\n\n2 His name from inscriptions (published in J.A.S.B. for 1873, p. 275) appears to be Shamsu-d-din Abul Muzaffar Y\u016bsuf Sh\u0101h. He appears to have reigned from 879 to 886 A.H., when he died. From his inscriptions found at Panduah, Hazrat Panduah, and Gaur, the following dates of his reign have been ascertained, namely, A.H. 882, 884, 885 (that is 1477, 1479, 1480 A.C.)\n\nFerishta says he was a scholar who charged the Ulema to see the law of the Prophet duly observed. \"No one dared to drink wine\" (Blochmann's Contr. J.A.S, for 1873, p. 275).\nREIGN OF FAT\u1e25 SH\u0100H, SON OF Y\u016aSUF SH\u0100H.\n\nAfter the death of Y\u016bsuf Sh\u0101h, his son Sikandar Sh\u0101h, ascended the throne. He had a little touch of lunacy. As he had no capacity for this important function, the nobles and the leaders deliberating that very day superceded him, and raised to the throne another son of Y\u016bsuf Sh\u0101h, named Fat\u1e25 Sh\u0101h. The latter was wise and sagacious. Observing with wisdom the usages of the rulers and sovereigns of the past, and bestowing on the nobles dignities according to their individual ranks, he pursued a liberal policy towards his subjects. In his reign, the gates of happiness and comfort were thrown open to the people of Bengal. It was then the established custom in Bengal for five thousand paiks to turn out every night with music, and for the king to go out for a while in the morning to receive their salute, and then to give them leave to depart, a new corps of paiks relieving them. One day, the eunuch of Fat\u1e25 Sh\u0101h, bearing the name of Barbag, leagued with the paiks, and slew Fat\u1e25 Sh\u0101h. This event took place in the year 896 A.H. Fat\u1e25 Sh\u0101h\u2019s reign lasted seven years and five months.\n\n---\n\nREIGN OF BARBAG, THE EUNUCH, STYLED SULT\u0100N SHAHZ\u0100D\u0100.\n\nBarbag the eunuch, the faithless miscreant, after slaying his own master, placed himself on the throne, according to the saying\u2014\n\nWhen a forest is untenanted, jackals give themselves the airs of lions.\n\n1 Stewart calls him a \u201cyouth of the royal family\u201d; other histories say nothing about his relationship. The Ain-i-Akbari gives him half a day; the Tabaqat gives him two and a half days; Ferihta gives no period, and Stewart gives him two months (J.A.S. for 1873, p. 281).\n\n2 His name from coins and inscriptions (J.A.S. for 1873, p. 281), appears to be Jal\u0101lu d-din Abul Muzaffar Fat\u1e25 Sh\u0101h. He appears from histories to have reigned from 887 to 896 A.H.; but inscriptions and coins show that he reigned in 886 A.H. Some of his coins were struck at Fathabad (Faridpur town) in 886 and 892 A.H. These together with the inscriptions on Baba Salih\u2019s mosque at Bandar, near Dacca (dated 886 A.H. or 1482 A.C.), of Bikrampur (Dacca District) on Adam Shahid\u2019s mosque (dated 888 A.H. or 1488), of Sunargaon on Muqqarabud-daulah-din\u2019s mosque (dated 889 or 1484 A.C.) are published in J.A.S.B. for 1873, pp. 282-285), and fix the dates of his reign. Fathabad (or Faridpur town) is named after him.\nHe styled himself Sultan Sh\u0101hz\u0101d\u0101. He collected together eunuchs from all places; and bestowing largesses on low people, won them over to his side, and attempted to enhance his rank and power. Finding that only his own peers would come within his clutches, he tried to destroy the high and influential nobles. Out of these, the premier-nobleman, Malik Andil, the Abyssinian, who was on the frontiers, becoming apprised of the eunuch's designs, planned to set his own capable son on the throne, and to finish off the eunuch's life-work. At that time, the doomed eunuch thought of summoning Malik Andil, in order to imprison him by means of a trap; then he issued orders summoning him. Malik Andil guessing the real significance of the summons, with a large number proceeded to meet the eunuch. Since the Malik observed great precaution in his ingress to and egress from the darbar, the eunuch despaired of destroying him. In consequence, one day, the eunuch arranging an entertainment, showed great intimacy towards Malik Andil, and placing a Qor\u0101n, said: \"Place your hand on the Holy Book, and vow that you will not injure me.\" Malik Andil vowed, \"So long as you are on the throne, I shall do you no injury.\" Inasmuch as all the people were designing to destroy that miscreant eunuch, Malik Andil also schemed to avenge the murder of his benefactor, and leaguing with the porters sought for an opportunity. One night, whilst that miscreant was intoxicated by excessive indulgence in liquor, and lay asleep on the throne, Malik Andil, being led in by the porters, entered the harem, to kill the eunuch. When he found the latter asleep on the throne, he hesitated, on recollecting his vow. Suddenly, that miscreant over whom a fatality was hanging, by the will of Providence which flings one from the throne of pride down to the dust of degradation, and places on another's head the crown of sovereignty, owing to his intoxication from liquor, slipped down from the throne. Malik Andil was delighted at this incident, and drew his sword on him, but did not succeed in dispatching him. Sultan Sh\u0101hz\u0101d\u0101, awaking, and seeing himself in front of an unsheathed sword, seized Malik Andil, and being strong, in the wrestling, threw down the latter, and sat on his chest. Malik Andil who held tightly the hair of the eunuch's head, did not let it go, but shouted out to Yugrush Kh\u0101n who was standing outside the room, to come up quickly. Yugrush Kh\u0101n, the Turk, with a number of Abyssinians, instantly\ncame in; and finding Malik Andil underneath the eunuch, hesitated in attacking with the sword. In the interval of search, the lights had fallen under the hands and feet of the two wrestlers and had got extinguished, and all was dark. Malik Andil shouted out to Yugrush Kh\u0101n, \"I am holding the hair of the eunuch's head, and he is so broad and robust, that his body has become in a way my shield; do not hesitate to strike with your sword, since it will not penetrate through, and even if it does, it does not matter; for I and a hundred thousand like me can die in avenging the death of our late master.\" Yugrush Kh\u0101n gently inflicted some strokes with his sword on the back and shoulder of Sult\u0101n Sh\u0101hz\u0101da, who feigned being dead. Malik Andil then got up, and along with Yugrush Kh\u0101n and the Abyssinians, went out, and Tawachi Bashi, entering the bed-room of Sult\u0101n Sh\u0101hz\u0101da, lighted up the lamp. Sult\u0101n Sh\u0101hz\u0101da, fancying him to be Malik Andil, before the lamp was lit, from fear not mounting the throne, had escaped into a cellar. Tawachi Bashi proceeding towards the cellar, entered it; then again Sult\u0101n Sh\u0101hz\u0101da feigned being dead. The Bashi cried out: \"It is a pity that rebels have killed my master, and ruined the kingdom.\" Sult\u0101n Sh\u0101hz\u0101da, fancying him to be one of his own loyal adherents, cried out: \"Look here, hold your peace, for I am alive,\" and enquired where Malik Andil was. Tawachi said: \"Thinking that he has killed the king, he has returned home with peace of mind.\" Sult\u0101n Sh\u0101hz\u0101da told him, \"go out, call together the nobles and set them to fetch Malik Andil's head, after killing him, and place watchmen in charge of the gates, warning them to be armed and on the alert.\" Tawachi the Abyssinian replied: \"Very well, now I go to effect a radical cure.\" Coming out, he quickly told the whole affair to Malik Andil, who again went in, and inflicting cuts with the dagger, finished off the eunuch's life, and leaving his corpse in that cellar, locked it, and coming out sent a person to summon Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n, the Vizier. And after the arrival of the Vizier, he held a council for the election of a king. And since the son of Fath Sh\u0101h was only two years old, the nobles were diffident as to how he could be placed on the throne, so that, in the morning, all the nobles being of one mind went to the house of the widow-queen of Fath Sh\u0101h, related to her the story of the night, and said: \"As the prince is a child, you should appoint one to manage the affairs of Government, until\nthe prince comes of age.\" The queen, on learning their anxiety, knew what to say. She said: \"I have made a vow to God that I would bestow the kingdom on the person who kills the murderer of Fath Sh\u0101h.\" Malik Andil, at first, declined to accept the burden of kingdom, but afterwards, when all the nobles collecting in that assembly unanimously besought him, he mounted the throne. The period of Sultan Sh\u0101hz\u0101da's reign according to one account was eight months, and, according to another account, two and a half months. After this incident in connection with Sultan Sh\u0101hz\u0101da, for some years, it became the ruling practice in Bengal that whoever slew the ruling king, and got an opportunity to seat himself on the throne, became recipient of homage and submission of the people, who did not protest against his installation. In one pamphlet, the period of the rule of Sultan Sh\u0101hz\u0101da is stated to be six months. God knows the truth.\n\n---\n\nREIGN OF MALIK ANDIL, THE ABYSSINIAN, STYLED FIRUZ SH\u0100H.\n\nWhen Malik Andil the Abyssinian, by his good fortune, took in lap the bride of the sovereignty of Bengal, he styled himself\n\n1 This affords another instance to illustrate the great influence exercised by Musalman ladies in the past, and the chivalrous deference paid to their wishes by Musalmans.\n\n2 \"The pretorian band of Abyssinians, which Barbak Sh\u0101h had introduced into Bengal, became from the protectors of the dynasty the masters of the kingdom, and eunuchs were the actual rulers of the country. . . . What royalty at that time was in Bengal is well described by Abul Fazl, who says that after the murder of Fath Sh\u0101h, low hirelings flourished; and Ferishta sarcastically remarks that the people would obey him who had killed a king and usurped the throne.\" Blochmann's Contr. (J.A.S. for 1873, p. 286).\n\nWith Sultan Sh\u0101hz\u0101da begins a succession of Habshi or Abyssinian kings, which terminated only with the rise of the Husaini dynasty of Bengal.\n\n3 His name, as appearing on his coins (J.A.S.B. for 1873, p. 288), is Saifu-d-din Abul Muzaffar Firuz Sh\u0101h. He was an Abyssinian or Habshi, and reigned from 893 to 895 A.H. (according to the testimony of coins); whilst histories give (incorrectly) the year of his death to be 899. He was (according to Riyaz) the premier nobleman and a generalissimo under Fath Sh\u0101h. He proved a wise king.\nFiruz Sh\u0101h, and proceeding to the metropolis of Gaur established himself there. In the directions of justice and liberality, he put forth noble efforts, and secured for his subjects peace and comfort. In that, during the time he was a noble, Malik Andil had done great and heroic deeds, both his soldiers and subjects dreaded him, and did not lean towards disaffection. In liberality and generosity, he was matchless. In a short time, he bestowed on the poor the treasures and largesses of past sovereigns, who had hoarded the same with considerable exertions and pains. It is said that on one occasion in one day he bestowed on the poor one lak of rupees. The members of Government did not like this lavishness, and used to say to one another: \"This Abyssinian does not appreciate the value of the money which has fallen into his hands, without toil and labour. We ought to set about discovering a means by which he might be taught the value of money, and to withhold his hand from useless extravagance and lavishness.\" Then they collected that treasure on the floor, that the king might behold it with his own eyes, and appreciating its value, might attach value to it. When the king saw the treasure, he enquired: \"Why is this treasure left in this place?\" The members of Government said: \"This is the same treasure that you allotted to the poor.\" The king said: \"How can this amount suffice? Add another lak to it.\" The members of Government, getting confounded, distributed the treasure amongst the beggars. Malik Andil, after reigning for three years, in 899 A.H. fell ill, and the light of his life was extinguished by the breeze of death. But the more reliable account is, that Firuz Sh\u0101h also was slain at the hands of the Paiks.\u00b9 A mosque, a tower and a reservoir in the city of Gaur, were erected by him.\n\n\u00b9 For a humourous description of the cowardice of the Bengal Paiks (an Infantry corps of Bengal) in the time of Sultan Ily\u0101s Sh\u0101h (1353 A.C.), see Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi by Zia\u2019 Barni (Pers. text, Faq. 7, p. 593), from which the following is translated: \"And the well-known Bengal Paiks who for years dubbed themselves 'Abu Bangal,' and gave themselves martial airs, and proclaimed their readiness to sacrifice their lives for Ily\u0101s Sh\u0101h the Bhang-eater, and used to attend that maniac of a monarch, in the company of the dusky-looking Bengali Rajahs\u2014at the time of actual warefare, put from fear their fingers into their mouths, ceased to be on the alert, threw down their swords and arrows, rubbed their foreheads on the ground, and were all put to the sword (by the army of Emperor Fir\u016bz Sh\u0101h Tughlak).\"\nTHE REIGN OF SULTAN MAHMUD, SON OF FIRUZ SHAH.\n\nWhen Firuz Shah passed to the secret-house of non-existence, the nobles and the ministers placed on the throne his eldest son, named Mahmud. And an Abyssinian slave, named Habash Khan, became the Administrator-General of financial and administrative affairs, and his influence so completely pervaded all affairs of government, that, except a bare title, nothing of sovereignty was left to Mahmud Shah, and the latter was compelled to live in this way, until another Abyssinian, who was called Sidi Badr Diwana, despairing of his ways, killed Habash Khan, and himself became the Administrator of the affairs of government. After some time, leagueing with the commandant of the Paiks, at night-time, he killed Mahmud Shah, and next morning with the concurrence of the nobles of the palace, who were in league with him, he ascended the throne, assuming the title of Muzaffar Shah. The reign of Mahmud Shah lasted one year. And in the history of Haji Muhammad Qandahari, it is related that Sultan Mahmud Shah was a son of Fath Shah, Jashn Khan, a slave of Barbag Shah, under order of Sultan Firuz Shah, trained him up; and after the death of Sultan Firuz Shah, Sultan Mahmud was placed on the throne. After six months had passed, Habash Khan, harboured notions of sovereignty in his head. Malik Badr Diwana killing Habash Khan, as has been related before, himself mounted the throne.\n\nTHE REIGN OF SIDI BADR, STYLED MUZAFFAR SHAH.\n\nWhen Muzaffar Shah mounted the throne in the city of Gaur, being very blood-thirsty and audacious, he slew many of the\n\n1 His name from coins and inscriptions (see J.A.S. for 1873, p. 289), appears to be Nasiru-d-din Abul Mujahid Mahmud Shah. Though the histories generally call him a son of Firuz Shah, the account of Haji Muhammad Qandahari referred to in the text, namely, that Mahmud Shah was a son of Fath Shah, appears to be more reliable. Mahmud Shah reigned in 896 A.H.\n\n2 \"Jashn Khan\" in the text is evidently a copyist's mistake for \"Habash Khan,\" an eunuch-slave of Barbag Shah, who according to Haji Muhammad Qandahari, was entrusted by Firuz Shah with the bringing up of Mahmud Shah, who was only two years old, when his father Fath Shah died, and Malik Andil Firuz Shah ascended the throne, with the consent of Fath Shah's queen.\nlearned and the pious and the nobility of the city, and also killed the infidel Rajahs who were opposed to the sovereigns of Bengal. He bestowed on Syed Husain Sharif Maki the office of Vizier, and made him Administrator of the affairs of Government. And he became assiduous in hoarding treasure, and by the counsel of Syed Husain, he cut down pay of soldiers, and set about building a treasury, and he committed oppressions in the collection of revenue. Consequently the people, receiving injuries at the hands of Muzaffar Shah, became disgusted with him. Gradually, Syed Husain's mind was also changed, so that matters came to this pass, that in the year 903 A.H., most of the principal noblemen, seceding from the king, went out of the city, whilst Sultan Muzaffar Shah with five thousand Abyssinians and three thousand Afghans and Bengalis entrenched himself in the fort of Gaur. For a period of four months, between the people inside, and outside, the city, fightings raged, and daily a large number of people were killed. It is said that, during the period Sultan Muzaffar was entrenched in the fort, whenever any one was captured and brought before him, he used to kill him with the sword with his own hand, with a ferocity characteristic of the Abyssinians, so that the number of people killed by him amounted to four thousand. At length, Muzaffar Shah, sallying out with his force from the city, gave battle to the nobles, whose leader was Syed Husain Sharif; and from both sides, twenty thousand men fell, either by the sword or the arrow.\n\n1 This sanguinary civil war in Bengal, about the end of the fifteenth century, between the Royalists on one side and the people on the other, headed by the nobles, reminds one of a similar war between king John and his barons in England, and illustrates that the people in Bengal were not \"dumb, driven cattle,\" but that they had sufficient political life and strength and powers of organization to control the monarchy, when its acts exceeded all constitutional bounds, as set by the Shara' or Mahommadan law. Indeed, Moslem monarchies, wherever established, (barring individual aberrations) have been constitutional in the strict sense of the word, from the time, when, in the seventh century, the first Khalifate was established in Arabia (see Sir W. Muir's \"Annals of the Early Caliphate\").\n\n2 His name on inscriptions and coins (published in J.A.S.B. for 1878, pp. 269-290), appears to be Shamsu-d-din Abu-Nasr Muzaffar Shah. His inscriptions and coins show that he reigned from 896 to 899 A.H. (that is, from 1491 A.C. to 1494 A.C.) Histories allot to his reign three years and five months. He was an Abyssinian, and his original name was Sidi Badr.\nThe field was heaped up with the slaughtered:\nYou might say another rampart had been raised!\n\nAt length, the zephyr of victory wafted on the standard of\nthe nobles. Muzaffar Shah, with a number of his associates and\nadherents, was killed on the field. And according to the state-\nment of Haji Muhammad Qandahari, during that time, from the\nbeginning to the end of the war, one lakh and twenty thousand\npeople, of both Musalman and Hindu persuasions, passed to the\nregions of destruction. And Syed Husain Sharif Maki, gaining\nthe throne, raised the standard of sovereignty. And in the\nhistory of Nizamuddin Ahmad, it is related that when the\npeople got disgusted with the misconduct of Muzaffar Shah, Syed\nSharif Maki becoming aware of this state of national disgust, won\nover to his side the Commandant of the Household troops and, one\nnight, with thirteen men entering the inner chambers, slew Muzaffar\nShah, and next morning mounted the throne, and proclaimed\nhimself Sultan Alauddin. The reign of Muzaffar Shah lasted\nthree years and five months. A mosque, amongst his other build-\nings, exists at Gaur.\n\nTHE REIGN OF 'ALAU-D-DIN SYED HUSAIN SHARIF\nMAKI.\n\nSyed Husain Sharif Maki, during the period of his Vizarat,\nused to treat the people with affability. He used to tell them:\n\n1 Nizamuddin Ahmad was Bakhshi under Akbar, and was a patron of\nthe historian Badaoni. Nizamuddin completed his history called Tabaqat-i-\nAkbari in 1590 A.C.; he is the first writer who gives a concise connected\naccount of the Independent Musalman kings of Bengal from 1388 A.C. to\n1538 A.C.\n\n2 His name on coins and inscriptions (vide J.A.S.B. for 1873, pp. 292-293),\nis \"Alauddin Abul Muzaffar Hussain Shah, son of Syed Ashraf-al-Husaini.\"\nNowhere on coins and inscriptions is he called \"Sharif Maki,\" as in the text.\nThe Tabaqat-i-Akbari simply calls him \"Alauddin\"; Ferishta erroneously\ncalls him \"Syed Sharif Maki\"; whilst Stewart incorrectly calls him \"Sharif\nMecca.\" He reigned from 899 to 927 A.H. (according to coins and inscriptions).\nThe Riyas states that Alauddin, after arriving as an adventurer in Bengal,\nsettled at a place called Chandpur in Radha district (Western Bengal), but Pro-\nfessor Blochmann (J.A.S.B. for 1873, p. 228 n.) is inclined to identify the Chand-\npur in question near Alipur or 'Alauddin's town,' on the Bhariab, east of\nKhulna, in Jessore district, as the place where the Husain dynasty of Bengal\n\"Muzaffar Shah is very stingy, and rude in behaviour. Although I advise him to attend to the happiness of the army and the independent kings had its adopted home, because Husain Shah first obtained power in the adjacent district of Faridpur or Fathahabad (which latter at the time was included in, or rather included portions of, Jessore), where his first coins were struck in 899 A.H. (Maraden's pl. XXXVIII, No. DCCLXXIX), and also because Husain Shah's son, Nasrat Shah, erected a mint at the neighbouring place of Khalifatabad (or Bagerhat, formerly in Jessore district) and minted there coins in the lifetime of his father in 922 A.H. (see p. 297; J.A.S.B. for 1873 and pl. IX, No. 10). Another circumstance which also supports the above theory of Professor Blochmann about the locale of Alauddin Hussain Shah's adopted home, appears to be this, that the names of Husain Shah, his brother Yusuf Shah, and his sons Nasrat Shah, and Mahmud Shah, are found in connection with several parganas of Jessore (Jasar) district (as formerly constituted, before its being split up into Pabna, Khulna and Faridpur districts), such as parganas Nasratshahi and Mahmudshahi and Yusuf-Shahi, and Mahmudabad (a whole Sirkar including Northern Jessore or Jasar and Boomal). In regard to Alauddin Hussain Shah, Professor Blochmann observes (J.A.S. for 1873, p. 291) that \"of the reign of no king of Bengal\u2014perhaps of all Upper India before the middle of the 10th century\u2014do we possess so many inscriptions. Whilst the names of other Bengal kings scarcely ever occur in legends, and remain even unrecognized in the geographical names of the country, the name of 'Husain Shah the Good' is still remembered from the frontiers of Orissa to the Brahmaputra.\" This great and good king extended his empire into Orissa, into Assam, into Chittagong, and reigned over all north Behar, and all south Behar up to the western limits of Sarkar Monghyr, where his son Danyal erected a vault over the shrine of Peer Nafa. (See Tabaqat-i-Akbari and also Badaoni, Vol. I, p. 371).\n\nA cathedral mosque amongst his other edifices was erected by this king, in 907 A.H. at Machain, opposite to Faridpur in Dhakah; the inscription of this mosque appears in J.A.S. for 1873, p. 293. The Husain Shahi dynasty consisted of four sovereigns: (1) Alauddin Hussain Shah who reigned from 899 to 929 A.H. (2) Alau-d-din's son, Nasir-d-din Abul Muzaffar Nasrat Shah (929 to 939). (3) Alau-d-din Firuz Shah (939), a son of No. 2, and (4) Ghiasu-d-din Mahmud Shah, (940-945 A.H.) the last Independent king of Bengal, who was defeated by Sher Shah's army at Gaur under Jalal Khan and Khwaja Khan in 944 A.H. or 1538 A.D. That is, for forty-four years, this Husaini dynasty consisting of four kings, reigned over Bengal. (See J.A.S.B. for 1872, p. 332). The Tabaqat-i-Akbari's notice of Bengal closes with an account of the reign of Nasrat Shah, the second king of the above Husaini dynasty. The fourth king of the Husaini dynasty, it may be of interest to remark, is the \"El Ray Mamad de Bengala\" of the Portuguese, who described Gaur, the capital at the time, as being \"three leagues in length, well-fortified and with wide and straight roads, along which rows of trees were planted to shade the people.\" This Mahmud Shah died in 945 A.H. at Colgong (Khalgaon), where he lies buried.\nnobility, and dissuade him from evil pursuits, it is all in vain; for he is simply bent on hoarding wealth.\" In consequence, the nobles looked upon Hussain as their friend, patron and sympathiser. As his virtues and Muzaffar Shah's vices were known to the public and to the elite, on the day that Muzaffar Shah was slain, all the nobles held a council for the purpose of electing a king, and favoured the installation of Syed Sharif Maki, and said, \"If we elect you king, in what way will you conduct yourself towards us?\" Sharif Maki said: \"I will meet all your wishes, and immediately I will allot to you whatever may be found over-ground in the city, whilst all that is under-ground I will appropriate to myself.\" The patricians as well as the plebeians fell in with this tempting offer, and hurried out to pillage the city of Gaur, which at this time eclipsed Cairo (in point of wealth).\n\nIn this way, a city was pillaged:\nYou might say, it was swept by the broom of plunder.\n\nSyed Sharif Maki by this easy contrivance, seized the umbrella of sovereignty, and introduced the Khutba and the coin in his own name. Historians write that his name was Syed Sharif Maki, and that when he ascended the throne, he styled himself 'Alau-d-din. But I note that throughout the kingdom of Bengal and in the neighbourhood of Gaur, his name as Husain Shah is on the lips of the elite and the mass. Since I did not find the name of Husain Shah in history, I was in doubt. After much research, by deciphering wordings of inscriptions which exist up to this day, and are engraved on the ruins of the City of Gaur, on the stone of the large gate-way of the Qadam Rasul building, and on the Golden Mosque, and also on some other shrines, which are amongst the edifices erected by Sultan Husain Shah and his sons Nasrat Shah and\n\n1 The Tabaqat-i-Akbari and Badaoni (p. 317 vol. 1) simply call him Alauddin (which however was obviously the Jalisa name), Ferishta erroneously calls him \"Sayed Sharif Maki,\" whilst Stewart incorrectly calls him \"Shiref Mecca,\" erroneously led no doubt by the remark of the Riyaz whose author thinks that Hussain's father or one of his ancestors might perhaps have been a Sherif of Mecca. The Alamgirnamah (p. 730) calls him Hussain Shah.\n\n2 The inscription dated 937 A.H. on the Qadam Rasul building at Gaur is published in J.A.S.B. for 1872, p. 338; in it Nasrat Shah is described as son of Hussain Shah, son of Syed Ashrafal Husaini.\nMahm\u016bd Sh\u0101h, it appears that Syed \u2018Al\u0101n-d-din Ab\u016bl Muzaffar Husain Sh\u0101h is the son of Syed Ashrafal-Husaini. In regard to the months and years of Syed Sharif Maki\u2019s period, all these inscriptions tally, and thus all doubts are set at rest. It appears that apparently his venerable father\u2014Syed Ashrafal-Husaini\u2014was Sharif of Makka; hence the son also was known as Sharif-i-Maki; or else, his name was Syed Husain. In a pamphlet, I have noticed that Husain Sh\u0101h and his brother Y\u016bsuf, together with their father, Sayyid Ashrafal Husaini, were residents of the town of Tarm\u016bz. By chance, they came to Bengal, and stayed in the mouz\u0101 of Chandpur in the zill\u0101 of Radha, and both the brothers took their lessons from the Q\u0101zi of that place. On knowing their noble pedigree, the Q\u0101zi married his daughter to Husain Sh\u0101h. After this, he entered the service of Muzaffar Sh\u0101h, and reached the office of Vizier, as has been related before.\n\nWhen he ascended the throne in the city of Gaur, after some days, he forbade the people from the pillage of the city, and when they did not cease, he slaughtered twelve thousand plunderers; then these stayed their hands from the work of pillage. And making search, he found much of the hidden treasures including thirteen hundred plates of gold. From ancient times, the custom in the country of Lakhnauti and East Bengal was that rich people preparing plates of gold, used to take their food thereon, and on days of carnivals and festivities, whoever displayed a large number of golden plates, became the object of pre-eminence. And this custom up to this time prevails amongst the rich and high-ranked people. Sult\u0101n \u2018Al\u0101n-d-din Husain Sh\u0101h, since he was a wise and sagacious sovereign, shewed considerateness towards the influential nobles, and raised his select officers to high positions and trusty offices. And he prohibited the Paiks\u2014whose faithlessness and regicides had become characteristic\u2014from guarding the Palace, and totally disbanded them, so that no harm might befall him. And in place of the Paiks, in the Guard-room and on the Band-stand, he appointed other body-guards. And he also expelled totally the Abyssinians from his entire dominions.\n\n1. A town in Turkestan.\n2. That is, the Western Bengal tract. See however, note 13 to p. 48, where Professor Bloehmann identifies Chandpur, near Alipur on the Bhairab, in Jessore district.\nSince these Abyssinians were notorious for their wickedness, regicides and infamous conduct, obtaining no footing in Jaunpur and Hindustan, they went to Gujrat and the Dakhin. Sultan 'Al\u0101'ud-d\u012bn \u1e24usain Sh\u0101h, girding up the waist of justice, unlike other kings of Bengal, removed his seat of government to Ekd\u0101l\u0101, which adjoins the city of Gaur. And excepting \u1e24usain Sh\u0101h, no one amongst the kings of Bengal made his seat of government anywhere, except at Pandua and the city of Gaur. As he was himself of noble descent, according to the saying, \"Every thing turns back to its origin\" he took the Syeds, Mughals and Afghans by the hand, and sent efficient District Officers to different places, so that peace in the country being secured, anarchy and revolutions which had occurred during the period of the Abyssinian kings, etc., vanished; and all disloyal elements were reduced to order. And subjugating the Rajas of the environs and conquering up to Orissa, he levied tribute. After this, he planned to conquer Assam, which is north-east of Bengal. With an overwhelming army consisting of infantry and a numerous fleet, he marched towards that kingdom, and conquered it. And conquering the whole of that country up to K\u0101mr\u016bp, K\u0101mtah and other districts which were subject to powerful Rajas, like R\u016bp Narain, and Mal Kunwar, and Gasa Lachhan and Lachmi Narain and others, he collected much wealth from the conquered tracts; and the Afghans demolishing those Rajas' buildings, erected new buildings. The Raja of Assam not being able to oppose him, relinquishing his country, fled to the mountains. The king, leaving his son\u00b9 with a large army to\n\n\u00b9 This was Prince Danyal (incorrectly known as Dulal Ghazi). This invasion of Assam took place in 1498 A.C. See J.A.S. for 1872, p. 335. Particulars of this invasion of Assam in 1498 A.C. or 908-4 A.H. are given in the Alamgirnamah pp. 730 and 731 and the Assam Buranji (J.A.S., for 1874, p. 281.). \u1e24usain Sh\u0101h's conquest of Kamr\u016bp and Kamta (western Assam) is also chronicled in a contemporaneous inscription of 907 A.H. (1501 A.C.) in a Madrasah or College founded by \u1e24usain Sh\u0101h at Gaur. This inscription is also published in J.A.S., for 1874, p. 303. \u1e24usain Sh\u0101h's first Governor of Western Assam or Kamr\u016bp was his son, Prince Danyal,\u2014the same prince who erected the vault over the shrine of Pir Nafa in Monghyr fort in 908 A.C., whilst returning from a mission on behalf of his father to meet Sultan Sikandar Lodi in Behar, and immediately before setting out on this Assam expedition (Badoni, p. 317 Vol. I). He was followed as Governor of Assam by Musunder Ghazi, who was succeeded by Sultan Ghissu-d-din who introduced a colony of Muhammadans into Assam.\ncomplete the settlement of the conquered country, returned triumphant and victorious to Bengal. After the withdrawal of the king, his son devoted himself to the pacification and defences of the conquered country. But when the rainy season set in, owing to floods, the roads and tracks became closed; and the Rajah with his adherents issued from the hills, surrounded the Royal army, engaged in warfare, cut off supplies of provisions, and in a short time put all to the sword. And the king, erecting a fort on the bank of the river Bhatah,\\(^1\\) bestowed great efforts on the improvement and advancement of the Kingdom of Bengal. And erecting and establishing Mosques and Rest-houses at different places in every district, he conferred numerous gifts on saints and recluses.\\(^2\\) And for the maintenance of the Rest-house in connection with the eminent saint, Nur Qutb-u-l-'Alam, he endowed several villages, and every year, from Ekd\u0101l\u0101, which was the seat of his government, he used to come to Pandua, for pilgrimage to the bright shrine of that holy saint.\\(^3\\) And because of his meed-worthy courteousness and affable deportment, and owing to the exuberance of his good sense and wisdom, he ruled for a long period with complete independence. In the year 900 A.H., Sult\u0101n Husain Sharqi, ruler of the Jaunp\u016br kingdom, on being defeated and pursued by Sult\u0101n Sikandar, proceeded to Colgong (Kahlgaon),\\(^4\\) and took shelter with Sult\u0101n 'Al\u0101u-d-din Husain Shah. The latter, paying regard to the refugee's rank, provided him with means of comfort, so that relinquishing anxieties and cares of sovereignty, Sult\u0101n Husain Sharqi passed the rest of his life at the above place. Towards the end of 'Al\u0101u-d-din's reign, Muhammad Babar the Emperor invaded Hindustan. Sult\u0101n Husain Shah, in the year 927 A.H., died a natural death. His reign lasted 27 years, and according to some, 24 years.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Stewart has 'Bateah,' and says it is the name of a stream, which also bears the name of Gandak. I do not know how far Stewart is correct.\n\n\\(^2\\) He also founded Madrasahs or Colleges for the advancement of learning, as is evidenced by the testimony of the contemporaneous inscription of 907 A.H. published in J.A.S.B., for 1874, p. 303.

Amongst the sovereigns of Bengal, none has been equal to 'Al\u0101u-d-d\u012bn \u1e24usain Sh\u0101h. And traces of his beneficence in this country are well-known to all. He had eighteen sons.

The most laudable work that he performed was that, instead of imprisoning his brothers, he doubled the offices which had been conferred on the latter by their father. And capturing the Rajah of T\u012brh\u016bt, he killed him. And he set two officers; named 'Al\u0101u-d-d\u012bn and Makh\u1e0dum 'Alim, otherwise known as Sh\u0101h 'Alim, and who were sons-in-law of \u1e24usain Sh\u0101h, for the conquest of the limits of T\u012brh\u016bt and Hajipur,\u00b2 and posted them there.

(See J.A.S.B. for 1873, pp. 296 and 297). Historians call him also Nasib Sh\u0101h (Badoni, p. 348), but perhaps whilst as a prince, he held the name of Nasib Kh\u0101n. He appears to have reconquered Chittagong Tract (see Tarikh-i-Hamidi and J.A.S. for 1872, p. 336), and to have subdued T\u012brh\u016bt and Hajipur tracts in North Behar\u2014and to have also held temporary sway over Azimgarh in the N.-W. Provinces (see Sikandarpur Azimgarh inscription published in J.A.S. for 1873, p. 296).

By this great battle, the sovereignty of\nSikandar Lodi, conquered the great empire of Hindustan, many of the Afghan Omra escaping, sought refuge with Nasrat Shah; And at length, Sultan Mahmud, brother of Sultan Ibrahim, being expelled from his kingdom, came to Bengal. Nasrat Shah showing kindness to every one, bestowed on all pargannahs and villages, in accordance with their respective rank and condition, and consistently with the resources of his kingdom. And he married Sultan Ibrahim's daughter, who had also come to Bengal. And planning the subjugation of the Mughal forces, he despatched Qutb Khan with a large force towards the environs of Bharaih. And the latter fought several battles with the Mughals, and for a period the contending forces were bivouacked there, fighting. But Khan Zam\u0101n, son-in-law of Emperor Babar, had conquered up to Jaunpur, and when in the year 930 A.H., Emperor Babar came to Jaunpur, and brought to his subjugation all its limits and environs, and planned to march to Bengal and to bring it also under his domination, Nasrat Shah, foreseeing the result, sent valuable presents and gifts in charge of wise envoys, and offered submission. Emperor Babar, in view of the exigencies of the times, made peace with Nasrat Shah, and retired. When Emperor Babar died on the 5th of the month of Jam\u0101diu-l-Awal\n\nIndia was transferred from Afghan hands to those of the Mughals. Strange enough to add, this revolution was effected by the intrigues of Afghan officers and Omara of Ibrahim who had joined Babar, and invited the latter to India. (Badaoni, Pers. text, p. 331, Vol. I). No doubt, it was a penalty paid by Sultan Ibrahim for his ill-treatment of his brothers, officers and noblemen, whom he constantly distrusted and disgraced.\n\n1 Sultan Mahmud was a son of Sultan Sikandar Lodi. He was set up as a King by Hasan Khan Mewati and Rana Sanka, and induced to fight with Babar who defeated him. After defeat, he lived at Chitor, whence he was brought by Afghans to Behar, and proclaimed its King. Sher Khan joined him, but subsequently deserted him in favour of Mughals, who defeated him. From Patna, he fled to Orissa, where he died in 949 A.H. (See Badaoni, pp. 361 and 338, Vol. I).\n\n2 Sarkar Bharaih is included in the Subah of Oudh, and is mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbari (Jarrett's Tr., Vol. II, p. 93).\n\nThis was the farthest western incursion made by the Musalman kings of Bengal (barring of course Sher Shah, who from king of Bengal rose to be Emperor of all India).\n\n3 See p. 139 Bloch. Tr., Ain, Vol. I. From Badaoni's account (p. 338, Vol. I), the conquest of Jaunpur appears to have been made by Humayun, during Babar's lifetime, In Badaoni (p. 344, Vol. I), Md. Zaman Mirza.\n937 A.H., and Emperor Hum\u0101y\u016bn ascended the throne of Delhi, it was rumoured that the Emperor of Delhi was planning the conquest of Bengal. Consequently, Na\u1e63rat Sh\u0101h in the year 939 A.H., in view of demonstrating his sincerity and friendship, sent rare presents in charge of Malik Marj\u0101n, the eunuch, to Sult\u0101n Bah\u0101dur Gujrati. Malik Marj\u0101n met Sult\u0101n Bah\u0101dur in the fort of Mandu, and became the recipient of a special Khillat. In the meantime, Na\u1e63rat Sh\u0101h, in spite of his being a Syed, indulged in dissipation and sundry oppressions, to detail which would be to harrow the feelings of all. And a world was grinding under his tyranny. In that interval, Na\u1e63rat Sh\u0101h rode to Aknakah, in the city of Ga\u016br, in order to visit the tomb of his father. As will would have it, there he punished an eunuch for some fault. From fear of life, this eunuch leagued with other eunuchs, and murdered Na\u1e63rat Sh\u0101h on his return to the palace, in the year 943 A.H. His reign lasted 16 years, and according to some, 13 years, and according to others, less than 13 years.\n\nThe foundations of the building of Qadam Ras\u016bl in the year 939, and the Golden mosque commonly called the Sona Musjid in the year 932 A.H., were laid by him, and these with their shattered doors and walls exist to this day, amongst the buildings of Na\u1e63rat Sh\u0101h, son of Sult\u0101n \u2018Al\u0101u-d-d\u012bn \u1e24usain Sh\u0101h, amidst the ruins of Ga\u016br. And the foundation of the luminous shrine of the saint Makhdum Akhi Sir\u0101ju-d-din at S\u0101du-l-l\u0101hpur is also amongst the noble relics of that monarch.\n\n1 He reigned in Gujarat from 1526 A.C. to 1536 A.C.\u2014see Ain-i-Akbari, Vol. II, p. 261, and Badaoni, pp. 344 to 347, Vol. I.\n\nHe foolishly engaged in a war with Humayun and was defeated, (Vol. II, p. 266, and Badaoni, p. 346, Vol. I).\n\n2 This building was in fair order when I visited Ga\u016br in 1887. It is a square one-domed building in the enclosure of the Fort. Its length from east to west is 24 cubits, and its breadth is the same. The Bhagirati flows to the west of it, about a distance of 30 rasis. This building was erected by Na\u1e63rat Sh\u0101h in 937 A.H. (1530 A.D). Inside the mosque under the dome, there is a foot-print of the Arabian prophet on a piece of stone, which is said to have been formerly at Panduah in the Chilla Khana of the Saint Jalal\u0101n-d-d\u012bn Tabrizi, who is supposed to have brought it from Arabia.\n\nThe inscription on the building is published in J.A.S.B. for 1872, p. 338.\n\n3 The date on the inscription is however, 937 A.H. (See J.A.S.B. for 1872, p. 338).\n\n4 See Ravenshaw's and Creighton's \"Ruins of Ga\u016br.\"\n\n5 He was a Saint of Ga\u016br. He came as a boy to Nizamu-d-d\u012bn Auliah of\n[Note by the author, Salim: In all the inscriptions that engraved on stones exist to this time, the king's name is mentioned as Nasrat Shah, son of Sultan 'Alau-d-din Husain Shah. In histories, his name is mentioned as Nasib Shah. Apparently, this is a corruption or a mistake, in that there is no room for mistake in the inscriptions engraved on stones.]\n\n---\n\nREIGN OF FIRUZ SHAH, SON OF NASRAT SHAH.\n\nWhen Nasrat Shah drank the disagreeable syrup of death, his son, Firuz Shah, by the counsels of the grandees, ascended the throne. He had reigned for three years, when Sultan Mahmud Bengali, who was one of the eighteen sons of Sultan 'Alau-d-din Husain Shah, and whom Nasrat Shah had installed to the rank of a nobleman, and who in the life-time of Nasrat, conducted himself like an ameer, finding an opportunity, slew Firuz Shah, and ascended the throne by right of inheritance from his father.\n\nDelhi and in course of time acquired great learning. He was then sent to Bengal, where he died in 758 A.H. or 1357 A.C. After Nizamu-d-din's death (according to the Haft I qlim), he went to Lakhnauti\u2014(See J.A.S. for 1873 p. 260).\n\nNasrat Shah could not have laid the foundation of the Saint's shrine; he could have only repaired and improved it, for the inscription on the shrine (see J.A.S. for 1873, p. 294), shows that its door was built by Nasrat Shah's father, Sultan 'Alau-d-din Hussain Shah, in 916 A.H. (A.C. 1510).\n\nAkhi's pupil was the Saint Alau-l-Huq, father of the Saint Nur Qutb 'Alam of history.\n\nAkhi was a contemporary of Shamsu-d-din Abul Muzaffar Ilyas Shah, King of Bengal.\n\n1 His name appears to be 'Alau-d-din Abul Muzzafar Firuz Shah, both on his coins and his inscriptions (See J.A.S.B. for 1873, p. 297). He reigned for only one year (939 A.H.) when he was slain by his uncle Mahmud Shah the next King. This would also put back the date of Nasrat Shah's murder to end of 938 or beginning of 939 A.H.; but Badaoni's account (p. 348, Vol. I), renders it doubtful.\n\n2 \"Three years,\" is evidently a copyist's mistake, for Stewart who bases his history on the Riyaz, mentions \"three months\" which he must have found in his copy of the MS. of the Riyaz, and which appears otherwise more consistent, chronologically.\nREIGN OF SULTAN MAHMUD, SON OF 'ALAU-D-DIN.\n\nWhen Mahmud Shah ascended the throne, Makhdu'm 'Alam, his brother-in-law, who was Governor of Hajipur, raised the standard of rebellion, and intrigued and allied himself with Sher Khan, who was in the tract of Behar. Mahmud Shah deputed Qutb Khan, Commandant of Monghyr, to conquer the Province of Behar, and to chastise Makhdu'm 'Alam. Sher Khan made efforts to conclude peace, but they were of no avail; and at length, by the concurrence of the Afghans, resolving to die, he determined to fight. When the two forces closed together, a great battle ensued. Qutb Khan was killed in the battle, and Sher Khan, obtaining his elephants and baggage, became powerful. After this, Makhdu'm 'Alam, in order to avenge himself, or to usurp the throne, raised the standard of rebellion, and fighting with Mahmud Shah, was killed. And Sher Khan Afghan instantly, who had usurped the throne of Delhi, drew his force towards Bengal. The nobles of Bengal, guarding the passes of Teliagadhi\n\n1 The name of this King as appearing on his coins and inscriptions is Ghiasu-d-din Abul Muzaffar Mahmud Shah (See J.A.S. for 1872, p. 339, and for 1873 p. 298). He was the last Independent King of Bengal, and reigned from 940 to 944 A.H. He is the \"El Rey Mamund de Bangala,\" with whom the Portuguese Alfonso de Mello made a treaty. At this time, Sher Khan and his brother Adil Khan had deserted the Mughal cause, and gone over to the side of the King of Bengal. But subsequently Sher Khan on the pretext of avenging the murder of Firuz Shah, made war on Mahmud Shah, besieged him at Gaur, and Mahmud Shah fled to Colgong (Kahalgan), where he died in 945 A.H. (1538 A.C.) of injuries received on the battle-field. (See Badaoni, p. 348, Vol. I).\n\n2 The town of Behar is meant. It appears that at this time both Sarkar Monghyr in South Behar and the whole of North Behar were subject to the Bengal kings, and Hajipur was the head-quarters from a long time of the Bengal Governor of North Behar. West of Sarkar Monghyr in South Behar, which was subject to the Sharqi kingdom of Jaunpur, on the decay of the latter kingdom, fell into the hands of semi-independent Afghan chiefs, including Darin Khan, his son Bahadur Khan (who proclaimed himself Sultan Muhammad), Sultan Mahmud, and Sher Khan. At this time, as the text shows, Makhdu'm 'Alam, Mahmud Shah's brother-in-law, who was his Governor of North Behar, and had his head-quarters at Hajipur, also rebelled against his sovereign, and intrigued with Sher Khan (afterwards Sher Shah). (See Badaoni, pp. 360, 358, 361, Vol. I).\n\n3 How Sher Shah acquired the Delhi Empire, is related in Tarikh-i-Sher Shahi, and also in Badaoni, and the Akbarnamah.\nand Sakrigali for one month continued fighting. At length, the passes of Teliagadhi and Sakrigali were captured, and Sher Kh\u0101n entered Bengal, and Mahm\u016bd Sh\u0101h, drawing his force, encountered the former, when a great battle ensued. Sult\u0101n Mahm\u016bd, being vanquished in the field, entrenched himself in the citadel, and sent a message to Emperor Hum\u0101yun in Delhi, seeking for help. Hum\u0101yun Sh\u0101h in the year 944 A.H. turned towards the conquest of the province of Jaunpur. Since at that time, Sher Kh\u0101n was in Bengal, Emperor Hum\u0101yun going to the foot of the fort of Chunar, laid siege to it. Ghazi Kh\u0101n S\u016br, who was in the fort on behalf of Sher Kh\u0101n, raised the standard of opposition, and for six months the siege was protracted. By the efforts of R\u016bm\u012b Kh\u0101n, ladders being mounted, the fort was scaled and captured by Hum\u0101yun. Sher Kh\u0101n also put forth grand efforts for capturing the fort of Ga\u016br, and the garrison were hardpressed. But as in the meantime one of the zamindars of Behar, becoming refractory, raised disturbance, Sher Kh\u0101n, finding it inexpedient to halt at Ga\u016br, left his son, Jall\u0101l Kh\u0101n, and Khaw\u0101s Kh\u0101n, one of his trusty nobles, to besiege the fort of Ga\u016br, whilst he himself marched back to Behar. And Jall\u0101l Kh\u0101n, son of Sher Kh\u0101n, skirmished with Mahm\u016bd Sh\u0101h, so that the garrison were reduced to straits, and food-grains became scarce in the city. On Sunday, the 13th of the month of Farwardi, corresponding to the 6th of Zil-Qadh, 944 A.H., Jall\u0101l\n\n---\n\n1 These passes are close to Colgong, and are now traversed by the E.I. Railway line. They were in those days considered the 'key' to Bengal. They were fortified under Sher Sh\u0101h's order by Qutb Kh\u0101n, son of Sher Kh\u0101n and Khaw\u0101s Kh\u0101n, slave of Sher Kh\u0101n. (See Badaoni, p. 349, Vol. I).\n\n2 In the \u0100in-i-Akbar\u012b, under the S\u016bbah of Allahabad, Chunar is described \"as a stone-fort in the summit of a hill, scarcely equalled for its loftiness and strength.\" The river Ganges flows at its foot\u2014\u0100in-i-Akbar\u012b (Jarrett's Tr., Vol. 2, p. 159).\n\n3 It is stated that its siege by Emperor Hum\u0101yun commenced on 8th January, 1538 A.C. As its siege lasted six months, and as it was stormed before Ga\u016br fell (on 6th April, 1538 A.C.) into the hands of Sher Sh\u0101h's general, Khaw\u0101s Kh\u0101n, the siege of Chunar must have commenced in October 1537 A.C. (See Tarikh-i-Sher Sh\u0101hi), or it may be that the fall of Ga\u016br took place in July 1538 A.C. (See Badaoni, pp. 348 and 349, Vol. I).\n\n4 See p. 441 Blochmann's Trans. of \u0100in, Vol. I, p. 441, and Badaoni, p. 348, Vol. I. Chunar was captured by Hum\u0101yun in 943 A.H.\n\n5 This corresponds to 6th April, 1538 A.C.\nKh\u0101n with other grandees, such as Khaw\u0101s Kh\u0101n, etc., struck up the kettle-drum of battle. Sult\u0101n Mahm\u016bd, who was hard-pressed by the siege, sallying out of the fort, advanced to fight. Since the period of his fortune had turned to declension, and the luck of Sher Kh\u0101n assisted the latter, Sult\u0101n Mahm\u016bd, unable to cope in battle, escaping by the way of Bhata,1 fled, and Mahm\u016bd Sh\u0101h's sons were taken prisoners; and the fort of Ga\u016br, together with other booty, fell into the hands of Jall\u0101l Kh\u0101n, son of Sher Kh\u0101n. Jall\u0101l Kh\u0101n and Khaw\u0101s Kh\u0101n, entering the fort, engaged in slaughter and capture and plunder of the garrison. And Sher Kh\u0101n also, being set free from the disturbance in Behar, pursued Sult\u0101n Mahm\u016bd. When they closed each other, Sult\u0101n Mahm\u016bd was obliged to fight, and receiving a serious wound, fled from the battle-field. Sher Kh\u0101n, victorious and triumphant, spurred on to Ga\u016br, and became master of Bengal. The Cathedral Mosque at S'adu-l-l\u0101hpur,2 amongst the buildings of Sult\u0101n Mahm\u016bd, son of Sult\u0101n 'Al\u0101\u016b-d-din Husain Sh\u0101h, exists to this day. From the inscriptions engraved on it, it appears that he was a son of Sult\u0101n 'Al\u0101\u016b-d-din Husain Sh\u0101h. The period of his reign appears to have lasted five years.3\n\nACCESSION OF NA\u015eIRU-D-D\u012aN MUHAMMAD HUM\u0100YUN P\u0100D\u015eH\u0100H TO THE THRONE OF GA\u016aR.\n\nSult\u0101n Mahm\u016bd, fleeing wounded from the battle with Sher Kh\u0101n, turned to meet Sult\u0101n Mu\u1e29ammad Hum\u0101yun, the Emperor. At the time when Sult\u0101n Hum\u0101yun the Emperor captured the fort of Chunar, Sult\u0101n Mahm\u016bd arriving at Darvishpura,4 and meeting the Emperor, and using much cajolery and persuasion, requested the Emperor to invade Bengal. The Emperor, taking pity on Mahm\u016bd, left Mirz\u0101 Dost Beg5 in charge of the fort of\n\n---\n\n1 See note ante.\n2 This was a quarter of Ga\u016br. The inscription on this mosque is published in J.A.S.B. for 1872, p. 339.\n3 The fate of Mahm\u016bd Sh\u0101h is fully described in the Tar\u012bkh-i-Sher Sh\u0101h\u012b, of which the Hon'ble Sir Edward Clive Bayley has published a translation in Dowson's edition of Elliot's History of India, IV, pp. 360-364.\n4 I have not identified this place; but it must have been close to Chunar.\n5 In Badaoni (p. 348, Vol. I), it is stated that when the King of Bengal\nChunar, and in the beginning of 945 A.H.\\(^1\\) raised the standard of march towards the conquest of Bengal. Sher Kh\u0101n,\\(^2\\) learning about this, despatched Jall\u0101l Kh\u0101n and Khaw\u0101s Kh\u0101n to defend the pass of Teliagadhi, which leads to Bengal. And this Teliagadhi and Sakrigali is a place between the provinces of Behar and Bengal, it is very impregnable; it is flanked on one side by a lofty hill and a dense forest which are quite impassable, and on another side by the river Ganges, to ford which is very difficult. Emperor Hum\u0101yun detached Jah\u0101ngir Beg\\(^3\\) Mughal to capture Teliagadhi and Sakrigali. On the day that Jah\u0101ngir Beg reached that place, just after he had dismounted, Jall\u0101l Kh\u0101n and Khaw\u0101s Kh\u0101n, marching up quickly with an efficient force, attacked him. The Mughal forces, unable to cope, were vanquished, and Jah\u0101ngir Beg, getting wounded, in a hapless condition, retreated to the Emperor's camp.\\(^4\\) But when Emperor Hum\u0101yun himself marched up to Teliagadhi and Sakrigali, Jall\u0101l Kh\u0101n and Khaw\u0101s Kh\u0101n, seeing their inability to stand the Emperor's onslaught, fled towards the hills, and from thence, to Sher Kh\u0101n at Ga\u016br. The Imperial army, forcing its way easily through that narrow defile, marched up, stage by stage. And when the Imperial camp halted at Kohal G\u0101on (Colgong), Mahm\u016bd Sh\u0101h, who was in the company of the Emperor, heard that his two sons who had been taken prisoners by Jall\u0101l Kh\u0101n, had been slain. From this grief and affliction, he pined away\n\n(named erroneously Nasib Sh\u0101h, which should be Mahm\u016bd Sh\u0101h) getting wounded in the war against Sher Sh\u0101h, came and met the Emperor (Hum\u0101yun), and invoked his help, the latter left Mir Hindu Beg Quohin in charge of Jaunpur province, and marched (from Chunar) towards Bengal, forcing the pass of Teliagadhi, which was fortified and held by Q\u016bb Kh\u0101n and Khawas Kh\u0101n (son and servant respectively of Sher Sh\u0101h).\n\n\\(^1\\) i.e., 1588 A.C.\n\n\\(^2\\) Sher Kh\u0101n or Sher Sh\u0101h was at this time at Ga\u016br and had made himself master of it. (See Badaoni, pp. 348 and 349, Vol. I). Mughal historians, to please the Mughal Emperors, invariably belittle Sher Sh\u0101h by calling him \"Sher Kh\u0101n.\" Sher Sh\u0101h finally defeated Hum\u0101yun (Jarrett's Tr., Ain, p. 421, and Badaoni, pp. 354 and 356, Vol. I) near Kanauj in A.H. 947 (A.C. 1540), when Hum\u0101yun fled to Sindh.\n\n\\(^3\\) He is mentioned as Governor of Bengal under Hum\u0101yun (vide Blochmann's Tr., Ain-i-Akbari, and also the text, Fasc. 1, p. 331, and also Badaoni, p. 352, Vol. I.)\n\n\\(^4\\) This must have been near Colgong (Kahlgan), at the time.\nday by day, and in a short time died. And since Sher Khan, on hearing about the approach of the Imperial forces, became anxious, he removed the treasures of the kings of Ga\u016br and Bengal, fled towards R\u0101dh\u0101, and from thence towards the hills of Jh\u0101rkand. Emperor Hum\u0101yun captured without opposition the city of Ga\u016br, which was the capital of Bengal, and owing to the ominous nature of its name, he changed it to Jinnatabad, and introduced the Imperial Khutba and coin. The ports of Sun\u0101rg\u0101on and Ch\u0101tg\u0101on (Chittagong), etc., came into the possession of the Emperor. For some time, the Emperor lived in ease and comfort, and did not pursue Sher Khan, and made light of the enemy. Three months had not yet passed, since his stay in that city, when owing to the badness of the climate of that place, many horses and camels died, and many soldiers fell ill. Suddenly, the news was received that the Afgh\u0101ns, marching by way of Jh\u0101rkand, had captured the fort of Rohtas, and that leaving a force for the defence of the fort, Sher Khan himself had marched to Monghyr, and had put to the sword the Emperor\u2019s grandees, who were there. And the news of the successful rebellion of Mirz\u0101 Hindal which had come to pass at Delhi, was also received. The Emperor becoming anxious on the receipt of the\n\n1 Mahm\u016bd Sh\u0101h, the last Independent Musalman king of Bengal, died at Colgong in 1538 A.C.\n\n2 This was the name which Western Bengal bore under Hindu Rajas.\n\n3 Chuta Nagp\u016br tract was so called during Moslem rule in India.\n\n4 Hum\u0101yun captured Ga\u016br, about July 1538. Hum\u0101yun stayed at Ga\u016br for three months, that is, till September 1538 A.C., and named the place Jinnatabad. (See Badaoni, p. 349, Vol. I).\n\n5 This important fort in South Behar was captured by Sher Sh\u0101h in 945 A.H. or about September 1538 A.C. by an ingenious stratagem. (See Badaoni, p. 349, Vol. I). Sher Khan induced the Rajah of Roht\u0101s to give shelter to his family in the Fort, and then sent in there two thousand armed Afghans in mahf\u0101s or palanquins; these latter killed the Rajah and his soldiers, and easily captured the Fort for Sher Sh\u0101h.\n\n6 In Fir\u016bghta occurs the following: \u201cAt this time news was received that Mirza Hindal had raised the standard of rebellion in Agrah and Mewat, had caused the Khutba to be recited after his own name, and had killed Shaikh Bahlol\u201d (Vol. I, p. 423, Pers. text). Delhi mentioned here therefore appears to be a mistake for Agra, as appears also from the text which follows. (See Badaoni, p. 350, Vol. I).\nnews from Delhi, appointed Jahangir Quli Beg Governor of Bengal, and leaving Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Beg, who was one of the principal Omra, with five thousand select cavalry in the former's company; himself swiftly marched back towards Agra. This happened in 946 A.H.\n\n---\n\nTHE ACCESSION OF SHER SH\u0100H TO THE THRONE,\nIN THE CITY OF GA\u016aR.\n\nWhen Emperor Hum\u0101yun in the year 946 A.H. withdrew towards Agra, Sher Kh\u0101n, apprised of the unpreparedness of the Imperial army and of the rebellion of Mirz\u0101 Hindal, set out from the fort of Rohtas with a large army. And at the time, when the Imperial camp arrived at Chansa, capturing the high way, for three months Sher Kh\u0101n bivouacked facing it, and caused as much harassment as he could. At length, by way of treachery and stratagem, sending to the Emperor Shaikh Khalil, the well-known saint who was his spiritual guide, Sher Kh\u0101n sought\n\n1 In Badaoni (p. 350, Vol. I). \"Jahangir Beg Mughal.\"\n2 His regal style was Faridu-d-din Abul Muzaffar Sher Sh\u0101h. He reigned from 944 to 952 A.H. or 1538 to 1545 A.C. He lies buried at Sahasram (Sassaram) in Behar. His first Governor of Bengal, Khizir Kh\u0101n, who married a daughter of Mahm\u016bd Sh\u0101h III, king of Bengal, was replaced by Qazi Fazilat, of Agra. Those who care to know the life and career of this remarkable Sovereign, will find a full account in Badaoni (Vol. I, pp. 356 to 374). A man of learning and wonderful resources, a dashing soldier, a general of high order (always ready to avail himself of all stratagems and tactics in war), a politician of keen diplomacy, when he mounted the throne, he exhibited the highest qualities of a statesman and a beneficent sovereign. Moderate and scientific in his revenue-assessments, liberal in his gifts, Jageers and benefactions, generous in supporting learning and the learned, wise in his army-reforms (copied subsequently by Akbar) munificent in laying down trunk roads, planting trees, sinking wells, establishing caravanserais, building Mosques, Madrasahs and Khanqahs, and erecting bridges, few Indo-Moslem Kings come up to his level. He administered justice so vigorously that he impressed his personality on all, and established thorough peace, so that, says Badaoni (p. 363, Vol. I), no dacoit or robber would dare to touch a gold plate, though it might be left on the road by an old woman, during her sleep.\n\n3 Sher Kh\u0101n had encamped on the right bank of the river between Chansa and Baksar. The river here is called Thor\u0101 N\u0101di. The battle of Chansa was fought on 9th Safar 946 A.-H. or 26th June, 1539 A.C. (See Badaoni, pp. 351 and 352, Vol. I).\nfor peace. The Emperor, owing to the exigencies of the times, accepted his overtures,\\(^1\\) and it was agreed that Bengal and the fort of Rohtas would continue in the possession of Sher Kh\u0101n, and that the latter would put forth no further pretensions, but that the Imperial coin and Khutba would be in force in those provinces. Sher Kh\u0101n, taking his oath on the holy Qur\u0101n, accepted these terms; and the Imperial army were reassured by this oath. But Sher Kh\u0101n, on the following day, with an efficient and well-equipped Afgh\u0101n force, taking the Imperial army by surprise, did not allow it time to rally into ranks, and after fighting became victorious, and closed the ferries where boats were moored. Owing to this cause, the king as well as the beggar, the high as well as the low, became dispirited and straitened, and being hardpressed by the Afgh\u0101ns, plunged pell-mell into the river Ganges, so that besides the Hindustanis, nearly twenty thousand Mughals got drowned. The Emperor also, plunging into the river, with the help of a water-carrier, with great difficulty crossed over to the bank of safety, and with a small number of followers, the cup of whose lives was not yet full to the brim, set out for Agra. Sher Kh\u0101n, after gaining this strange victory, returned to Bengal, fought repeatedly with Jah\u0101ng\u012br Quli Beg, and at length by way of deception and treachery, invited him to his presence, and slew him and his retinue. And putting to the sword the remainder of the Imperial army who were at other places, he introduced the Khutba and the coin after his own name, and brought the provinces of Bengal and Beh\u0101r absolutely under his domination. And from that time he assumed the title of Sher Sh\u0101h,\\(^2\\) and that year devoting himself to the\n\n\\(^1\\) Rather the overtures for peace were made by Hum\u0101y\u016bn, who sent Mulla Muhammad Aziz for the purpose to Sher Kh\u0101n, who was then at Chausa. At the time, Sher Kh\u0101n with his sleeves stuck up and with a spade in hand, in grilling weather, was digging a trench, and fortifying the place. On seeing the Mulla, he sat down on the bare ground, and in reply to the Mulla said: \u201cTell this one word on my behalf to the Emperor, that he seeks war, and not his soldiers, whilst I do not seek war, but my soldiers do.\u201d Sher Sh\u0101h then sent to the Emperor his spiritual guide Shaikh Khalil, a descendant of Shaikh Farid Ganj Sh\u0101kar.

Sher Kh\u0101n marched to Ga\u016br, slew Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s Governor, Jahangir Quli Beg, and assumed the same year at Ga\u016br the royal title of Faridu-d-din Abul Muzaffar Sher Sh\u0101h, and struck coins. Sher Sh\u0101h stayed\nsettlement of his kingdom, attained great power and pomp. At the end of the year, leaving Khizr Khan to rule over Bengal, he himself started for Agra. And from that side, Humayun's force, despite the fraternal dissensions, consisting of one hundred thousand soldiers, marched forward to encounter him. And in the year 947 A.H.\\(^1\\) on the tenth day of the month of Muharram, in the neighbourhood of Qanauj, on the banks of the river Ganges, the contending hosts faced each other. And whilst the Mughal forces were preparing to encamp at this stage, nearly fifty thousand Afghan cavalry dashed up. The Imperial army, without fighting, was routed, and Sher Shah chasing it up to the river, marched forward to Agra.\n\n---\n\nRULE OF KHIZR KHAN AT GAUR.\n\nWhen Khizr Khan was appointed Governor of Bengal on behalf of Sher Shah, he married a daughter of one of the kings of Bengal,\\(^2\\) and in his mode of living, and in his paraphernalia of comforts and luxuries, observed the kingly mode. And when Sher Shah at Agra came to know about this, exercising foresight, he deemed it proper to adopt remedial measures against the disease before it shewed itself, and swiftly marched to Bengal. And when Khizr Khan went forward to receive him, Sher Shah imprisoning him, divided the province of Bengal amongst several tribal chiefs, and appointed Qazi Fazilat, who was one of the learned scholars of Agra, and who was distinguished for his virtues, honesty and trustworthiness, to be the over-lord, and entrusting to his hands the power of making peace and war in the country, he himself returned to Agra.\\(^3\\)\n\ntill end of December 1539 A.C. at Gaur, and then leaving Khizr Khan as his Governor of Bengal, he marched towards Agra.

And for some years until the end of Salim Sh\u00e2h's reign he continued so, after which he raised the standard of rebellion, and turned towards the\n\nments that he introduced at this time in Bengal, vis., of placing different tribal chiefs to rule over different territorial divisions would indicate that he was fully alive to the policy \"Divide and rule.\" His installation of Qazi Faz\u00eelat, a scholar of Agra, in a position of over-lordship over these tribal chiefs, further indicates that he set a high value on learning. Sher Sh\u00e2h died on 12th Rabi I, 952 A.H. (3rd June, 1546); he lies buried at Sahsaram, in South Behar. See Tarikh-i-Sher Sh\u00e2hi for an interesting account of Sher Sh\u00e2h's career, and also Badaoni, p. 365, Vol. I, Firishta and Akbarnamah.\n\nSher Sh\u00e2h was the first ruler who from a king of Bengal, became the Emperor of all India. His triumph was a triumph for Bengal, whose prosperity and welfare continued to receive his special attention, even after he became Emperor of India. Mughal historians generally (no doubt from their delicate position) have failed to appraise Sher Sh\u00e2h's qualities as a statesman and as a soldier at their proper worth. His reign was fruitful of military, fiscal, agricultural, economic, currency and revenue reforms in Bengal, and also of many public works of utility, such as roads, rest-houses, bridges, fortifications, Khanqas, colleges and wells, &c.\n\n1 \"Kalinjar is a stone fortress in S\u00fbbah Allahabad, upon heaven-reaching hill.\"\u2014Ain.

The battle of Chapparghatha was fought between the two in 962 A.H. (1555 A.C.) Chapparghatha is east of Kalpi, on the Jamuna river. He ruled as Islam Sh\u0101h\u2019s Governor of Bengal from 952 to 960 A.H., and reigned as king of Bengal from 960 A.H. to 962 A.H., that is from 1553 to 1555 A.C.

He reigned over Bengal as king from 962 to 968 A.H. (or 1555 to 1561 A.C.) Badaoni calls him Muhammad Bahadur. The most important event of his reign was his war with \u2018Adli Sh\u0101h, whom he defeated at the decisive battle of Surajgarha in Monghyr district, in 964 A.H. At this battle, Sulaim\u0101n Kararani who held South Behar from Sher Shah\u2019s reign assisted Bahadur Sh\u0101h.

Professor Blochmann locates the battle-field at Fatehpur village, 4 miles west of Surajgarh and the Keol nadi.

He reigned over Bengal and North Behar from 968 to 971 A.H. (or 1561 A.C. to 1564 A.C.) During this period, Sulaim\u0101n Kararani continued as semi-independent Governor of South Behar, whilst Hajipur which had risen in importance from the time of Nasrat Sh\u0101h continued to be the head-quarters of the Bengal Governor of North Behar. Patna became the seat of Behar Governors from the time of Emperor Akbar. Sher Sh\u0101h had built the Fort of Patna (see Bloch. Contr. J.A.S. for 1875, p.302).

He assumed the title of Rajah Bikrammadit at Delhi. He ill-treated the Afghans, who at heart despised him, and who, therefore, for the most part threw in their lot with Akbar. (See Badaoni, Vol. II, pp. 13 to 16).\n\n\u00b2 See Badaoni, Vol. I, pp. 422 to 428. During the chaos which arose during the latter part of the feeble reign of Muhammad Sh\u0101h Adli, it was arranged between Ibrahim and Sikandar alias Ahmad Kh\u0101n, that the former would rule over the Eastern Empire from Delhi to the easternmost portions of India, whilst the latter would be master of the Panjab, Multan and other western tracts.\n\n\u00b3 According to the Akbarnamah, Badaoni and the Tabaqat-i-Akbari, he died in 980 A.H. and reigned in Bengal from 971 to 980 A.H., or 1568 to 1572 A.C. He is sometimes called Kararani and sometimes Karani and also Kran\u012b. It is related of him that he held every morning a devotional meeting, in company with 150 Sh\u0101ikhs and \u2019Ulamas, after which he used to transact business during fixed hours, (See Bloch, Tr., Ain, p. 171, and Badaoni, Vol. II, pp. 76, 173, 174 and 200), and that this practice influenced Akbar\u2019s conduct. His conquest of Orissa (in 975 A.H. or 1567 A.C.) mainly through the efforts of his distinguished general, Kalaphar, is detailed in a following section in the text, and also in Firishta, Akbarnamah, and Tarikh-i-Daudi.\nnor of the S\u016bbah of Behar, which he continued to hold in the reign of Salim Sh\u0101h. When Salim Sh\u0101h passed to the regions of eternity, in Hindustan, tribal chiefs established themselves, and in every head the ambition of sovereignty, and in every heart the aspiration of suzerainty, arose. Sulaim\u0101n Kh\u0101n, after the death of his brother, T\u0101j Kh\u0101n, established himself with full independence as king of Bengal and Behar, and abandoning the City of Ga\u016br, owing to the inclemency of its climate, established himself in the town of Tandah.1 And in the year 975 A.H., he conquered the country of Orissa, and placing it under a permanent Governor with a large army, he himself set out for the conquest of the country of Kuch Behar. He subjugated its environs and outlying parts, and whilst he was besieging its capital, he got news that the insurgents in Orissa had again raised the standard of insurrection. Thus, of necessity, he abandoned the siege of Kuch Behar town,2 and returned to Tandah, which was his Capital. And for some time, in a similar manner, there was commotion all over Hindust\u0101n. And when Emperor Hum\u0101yun returned to Hindust\u0101n from Persia, Sulaim\u0101n Kh\u0101n, exercising foresight, sent a letter embodying sentiments of loyalty and\n\nHis principal nobleman and officer, Kh\u0101n Jahan Lod\u012b, held a conference with Akbar's general, Munim Kh\u0101n-i-Khan\u0101n, in the neighbourhood of Patna, and it was arranged to recite the Khutba and strike coins in Bengal after Akbar's name (see p. 427, Bloch, Tran., Ain, and Badaoni, p. 174). In 972 A.H., Sulaim\u0101n removed his capital from Ga\u016br to Tandah. Akbar sent an embassy to him (Badaoni, p. 76, Vol. II).\n\n1 Tandah was on the west side of the Ganges, nearly opposite to Ga\u016br.\n\nIn 972 A.H. (1564 A.C.) Sulaim\u0101n Kararani, the Afghan king of Bengal, abandoned Ga\u016br on account of its bad climate, and shifted the capital westward to Tandah, which was also called Khwaspur Tandah. In 983 A.H. (1575 A.C.) Munim Kh\u0101n-i-Khan\u0101n, Akbar's Sip\u0101salar, re-occupied Ga\u016br, where a pestilence soon broke out, and he as well as many Mughal officers and soldiers died. (See Badaoni, pp. 216 and 217, Vol. II). About 1242 A.H. (1826 A.C.) Tandah was destroyed by floods, and disappeared into the river. Now-a-days it lies as a heap of dust about a mile from Lakhipur. (See Beveridge's Analysis of Khurshid Jahan Numa, J.A.S., 1895, p. 215).\n\n2 Taking advantage of the dissensions between the Afghans under Sher Sh\u0101h and the Mughals under Emperor Hum\u0101yun, Kuch Behar which had previously been subdued by Alau-d-din Husain Sh\u0101h, king of Bengal, and partially re-conquered by Sulaim\u0101n Kararani rose into semi-independence in 944 A.H. under Biss\u0101, and became independent under Rajas Nara Narayan (962 A.H.) and Bal Gosain (980 A.H.) Subsequently it was reconquered.\nfriendship, together with presents. From the other side also, owing to the exigencies of the times which called for the destruction and extirpation of the descendants and adherents of Sher Shah, the presents and gifts were accepted, and a condescending reply containing expressions of reassurance and good-will was sent, together with a Royal manifesto, ratifying Sulaiman's continuance in his office. After this, though Sulaiman Khan continued the Khutba and the coin after his own name in the kingdom of Bengal, he styled himself Hazrat 'Ala (the Supreme Chief), and outwardly showing submission to Jallalu-d-din Muhammad Akbar Badshah, he sent occasionally presents and gifts. Nearly sixteen years ruling independently over Bengal, in the year 981 A.H. he died. And he was very energetic, industrious, and strict. In the history of Firishta, the reign of Taj Khan is not given, and the reign of Sulaiman Khan is described as lasting 25 years. Since the brothers, from the beginning, held conjointly the rule of this country, and Taj Khan came afterwards, therefore the rule of both has been ascribed to one. God knows the truth!\n\n---\n\nREIGN OF BAYAZID KHAN, SON OF SULAIMAN KHAN:\n\nAfter Sulaiman's death, his son Bayazid Khan, assuming the sovereignty, ascended the throne of Bengal. As yet more than a month had not elapsed, and according to another account, one year and six months he had ruled, when an Afghan named Hanso, who was a cousin and brother-in-law of Bayazid, attacking him,\n\n1 From note ante, it would appear that he ceased to do so in Akbar's time.\n2 From note ante, it would appear that he ruled only for ten years over Bengal, whilst he held Behar from the time of Sher Shah.\n3 He reigned in 990 A.H. or 1572 A.C. (See extract from Badaoni and the Sawanik Akbari regarding the death of Sulaiman, accession and assassination of his son Bayazid, and the installation of Bayazid's brother Daud, chiefly through the efforts of Lodi Khan, the premier nobleman of the Bengal kingdom (J.A.S. for 1875, pp. 304-305).\n\nBadaoni who was a zealous Moslem remarks that 'Sulaiman conquered the town of Katak-Benaras, the mine of unbelief,' and made Jagannath (Puri) a dar-ul Islam, and ruled from Kamrup to Orissa. Sulaiman's first Viceroy of Orissa (including Katak) was Lodi Khan alias Khan Jahan Lodi, and his first Governor of Jagannath or Puri was Qutlu Khan (see Badaoni, p. 174, Vol. II).\nkilled him by stratagem in the Audience-hall, and attempted to become Administrator of the affairs of the kingdom. Lodi Kh\u0101n who was a principal and trusty officer of Sulaim\u0101n Kh\u0101n, demurring, tried to kill him. According to a tradition, after 2\u00bd days, the younger brother, named D\u0101ud Kh\u0101n, killed Hanso, to avenge the death of his brother. Either way, after Bayazid, his brother, D\u0101ud Kh\u0101n, succeeded to the throne.\n\n---\n\nREIGN OF D\u0100UD KH\u0100N, SON OF SULAIM\u0100N KH\u0100N.\n\nWhen D\u0101ud Kh\u0101n ascended the throne of Bengal, subduing completely all parts of Bengal, he introduced the Khu\u1e6dba and the coin after his own name. Owing to continual indulgence in wine and association with low and mean people, and because of numerous troops and retinue, and plethora of equipage, and abundance of effects and riches, and greatness of rank and dignity (in that he had 40,000 well-mounted cavalry, and 3,300 elephants, and 140,000 infantry, consisting of musketeers, matchlockmen and rocketeers and archers, and 20,000 pieces of ordnance, most of which were battering guns, and many armed cruisers, and other\n\n---\n\n1 It is related in the Sawan\u012bh Akbar\u012b and Badaoni that Bayazid \"in his youthful folly read the Khu\u1e6dba in his own name, neglected all forms of courtesy, and also ill-treated the chief nobles of his father who consequently hated him. Hanso, the son of his uncle Imad (brother of Sulaim\u0101n), who was also his brother-in-law, then killed him. Lodi Kh\u0101n then killed Hanso; installed D\u0101ud. (See J.A.S. for 1875, pp. 304-305).\n\n2 D\u0101ud Kh\u0101n became king of Bengal, Behar and Orissa in 980 A.H. (1572 A.C.) and reigned from 980 A.H. to 984 A.H. (1572 to 1576 A.C.), under the title of Abul Muzaffer D\u0101ud Sh\u0101h. In 982 A.H. Akbar personally wrested Behar from him by storming Patna and Hajipur forts, and D\u0101ud fled to Orissa, where the battle of Mughulmari or Tukaroi north of Jaligarh, was fought in 1575 A.C. between him and the Imperialists, commanded by Munim Kh\u0101n-i-Khan\u0101n. D\u0101ud was defeated, and concluded the Peace of Katak, under which Bengal and Behar were ceded by him to Akbar, the latter recognising D\u0101ud's sovereignty over Orissa. In 988 A.H. Munim Kh\u0101n-i-Khan\u0101n died of malaria at Ga\u016br, with a large part of his army, and D\u0101ud Kh\u0101n, encouraged by this circumstance, invaded Bengal, and on 15th Rabi II 948 A.H. (12th July, 1576 A.C.), was defeated by Akbar's General, Husain Quli Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n, at Akmalah or Rajmahal, captured and beheaded. (See Tarikh-i-D\u0101udi, Firishta, Badaoni and Akbarnamah). With D\u0101ud Kh\u0101n's death (1576 A.C.), the Kararani dynasty ended in Bengal.\nimplements of war, which he had ready and in store) he became haughty, and aiming at conquests caused troubles to the frontiers of the Empire of Emperor Akbar. Although the well-wishers dissuaded him from this policy, and gave him good counsel, he did not listen. And Munim Khan, styled the Kh\u0101n-i-Kh\u0101n\u0101n, who was Akbar's Governor of Jaunpur, and held a mansab of Panjha\u1e63\u0101r\u012b, under the order of the Emperor, turned towards the destruction and extirpation of D\u0101nd Kh\u0101n, and sent in advance of himself a small body of Mughal officers. D\u0101nd Kh\u0101n, on hearing of this, appointed Lodi Kh\u0101n Afgh\u0101n, who was his premier grandee, to oppose the Mughals. At Patna, both the armies encountered each other, and for some time were engaged in skirmishes. At length, both the factions patched up terms, and both the armies withdrew to their respective Provinces. But Emperor Akbar, declining to ratify the treaty, appointed R\u0101ja Todar Mal (after\n\n1 He was appointed to his jagirs in Jaunpur in the 12th year of Akbar's reign, when he concluded peace with Sulaim\u0101n Kararani, king of Bengal, who promised to read the Khu\u1e6dba and strike coins in Akbar's name. Munim in 982 A.H. was appointed Governor of Behar (after Akbar captured Hajipur and Patna from D\u0101nd) and ordered to follow D\u0101nd into Bengal. Munim moved to Tandah, opposite to G\u0101ur, on the right side of the Ganges, to settle political matters, and left the pursuit to Mu\u1e25ammad Quli Kh\u0101n Barlas. The latter followed D\u0101nd to Satgaon, whence however, D\u0101nd withdrew to Orissa, and Mu\u1e25ammad Quli Kh\u0101n Barlas from Satgaon invaded the district of Jessar (Jessore), where Sarmadi, a friend of D\u0101nd, had rebelled, but the Imperialists, here too met with no success, and returned to Satgaon. Mu\u1e25ammad Quli soon after died at Midnapur, and Munim Kh\u0101n with Todar Mal invaded Orissa, defeated D\u0101nd at the battle of Mughulmari or Tikaroi, when the Peace of Katak was concluded, under which Bengal and Behar were ceded by D\u0101nd to Akbar. Munim died of malaria at G\u0101ur in 983 A.H. The great bridge of Jaunpur was built by him. It may also be of interest to note that another general, named Murad Kh\u0101n, under Munim Kh\u0101n-i-Kh\u0101n\u0101n, about 982 A.H. invaded Fathabad (or Faridpur), and conquered it as well as Sarkar Bogla. This Murad Kh\u0101n died at Fathabad (Faridpur) in 983 A.H., and Mukund, the zamindar of Fathabad and Bhosna, invited Murad's sons to a feast and treacherously murdered them. See Bloch. Trans., Ain, Vol. I, p. 318 and Badaoni, pp. 178 and 180.\n\n2 For a biographical account, see Blochmann's Tr. of Ain-i-Akbari, Vol. I, p. 82. He was a Khetri by caste, and attained the mansab of Chahar-ha\u1e63\u0101r\u012b and also the office of Akbar's Naib Diwan or Deputy Finance Minister. He was very loyal to his sovereign, and Akbar held a high opinion of him. The rent-roll associated with his name and prepared under the direction of his sovereign, is well-known, and is given in the Ain-i-Akbari. (See Ain-i-\nraising him to the rank of Haz\u0101r\u012b) to the office of Administrator of Bengal, and sent him in advance of the Kh\u0101n-i-Kh\u0101n\u0101n, and detached other officers and soldiers under the command of the aforesaid Kh\u0101n for chastising D\u0101ud Kh\u0101n, and repeated his order to the Kh\u0101n-i-Kh\u0101n\u0101n in regard to the conquest of Behar. Since at that time, between D\u0101ud Kh\u0101n and Lodi Kh\u0101n, some estrangement had arisen, Lodi Kh\u0101n, being displeased, opened with the Kh\u0101n-i-Kh\u0101n\u0101n communications of conciliation, and avowed towards Emperor Akbar sentiments of submission and loyalty. Another Afghan officer, named Qutlu Kh\u0101n, who bore a grudge against Lodi Kh\u0101n, shaking the chain of enmity, denounced Lodi Kh\u0101n before D\u0101ud Kh\u0101n, stating that Lodi Kh\u0101n had been in collusion with Akbar's grandees, and that covertly he was of one mind with the latter. D\u0101ud Kh\u0101n, on being apprised of this, writing a soothing letter to Lodi Kh\u0101n, and bringing him over to his side, had him in his presence, and churlishly slew Lodi Kh\u0101n, who was renowned for his soundness of views, sagacity, bravery and valour. D\u0101ud Kh\u0101n then himself with a large army marched towards the bank of the river Sone, to encounter Akbar's army. And at the point of the confluence of the rivers Sone, Sro and the Ganges, a great naval engagement took place.\n\nThe young and the old were tired out with the battle,\nOwing to incessant shower of spears and arrows.\nThe hurle of daggers rose to the skies,\nHearts were pierced, and a torrent of blood set a-flowing in the river.\nThe battle-axe became inlaid on the helmets of the heroes,\nLike the comb of fighting cocks on the head.\n\nAt length, the fortune of Akbar triumphed, and the Afghans being routed, took to flight, and retired to Patna. Some of their war-vessels fell into the hands of the Mughals. The Kh\u0101n-i-Kh\u0101n\u0101n also following up and crossing the river, marched with the greatest expedition to Patna, and investing that fort, where D\u0101ud Kh\u0101n had entrenched himself, prepared to assault it.\n\nAkbari, Vol. II, Jarrett's Tr., p. 88, and also Vol. I, pp. 366 and 348 Blochmann's Tr.) It would appear that this great rent-roll which has made Todar Mal so famous, was jointly prepared by him and his Chief, Muazzafar Kh\u0101n, Akbar's Chief Finance Minister or Diwan. (See Badaoni).\nWhen the signal to assault the fort was given,\nFrom both sides a hundred guns and muskets roared.\nFrom the booming of the thundering guns, and their smoke,\nLike unto the sable cloud wherein the thundering angel dwells,\nFrom the shower of cannon-balls, like the hail,\nGushed in amidst those armies a deluge of destruction.\n\nWhen this news reached Muhammad Jall\u0101lu-d-din Akbar, he came to realize that without his effort the conquest of the fort of Patna was impossible. Therefore, mustering up Imperial courage, he with all his princes and nobles set out in one thousand flotilla of boats, placing over them covers of variegated colours, in the thick of the rainy season. When the Emperor reached the suburbs of Patna, he got news that \u2018Aesh Kh\u0101n Ne\u0101zi, who was one of the faithful officers of D\u0101ud Kh\u0101n, sallying out of the fort, had been killed whilst fighting with the Kh\u0101n-i-Kh\u0101n\u0101n, and that the garrison of the fort were contemplating flight. The Emperor then detached Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lim\u00b9 with a corps of 3,000 cavalry for storming the fort of Hajipur; and the latter arriving there, wrested the fort from Fath Kh\u0101n, and reduced it to his own possession. D\u0101ud Kh\u0101n, on hearing of the fall of the fort of Hajipur, deputed sagacious envoys to the Emperor Akbar, asking forgiveness for his misconduct. The Emperor replied that on his personal attendance, his crimes would be forgiven; and in the event of his non-attendance, he might choose one out of the following three alternatives: \u201c(1) either he might engage singly in a combat with me, (2) or he might send one of his grandees to fight singly with one of my grandees, (3) or he might send one of his war-elephants to fight singly with one of my elephants; whoever is triumphant in either, the country shall be his.\u201d D\u0101ud Kh\u0101n, on receiving this message, was frightened, and seeing no advantage in tarrying at Patna, at night-fall slipped\n\n\u00b9 His name was Chalmah Beg. He was Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s Safarchi or table-attendant. Hum\u0101y\u016bn sent him with Mirza Kamran to Mecca, and on the latter\u2019s death, he returned to India, was graciously received by Akbar who conferred on him the title of Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lim. \u2018When Akbar moved against D\u0101ud Sh\u0101h in Patna, Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lim commanded a corps, and passing up the river on boats towards the mouth of the Gandak, effected a landing.\u2019 (See Blochmann\u2019s Tr. of Ain, Vol. I, pp. 378-379).\nout through the iron-gate, and getting into a boat, and leaving behind effects and equipage, fled towards Bengal. The forts of Hajipur and Patna were seized by the Imperialists, and the Emperor Akbar pursued the vanquished Afghan army to a distance of 25 kro, and 400 war-elephants of Daud Khan, together with other equipages, fell into the hands of the Mughal heroes. Whoever (amongst the vanquished) fled, saved his life, the rest were put to the sword. The Emperor, leaving Munim Khan to subjugate the outlying provinces and to extirpate Daud Khan, retired from Dariapur. When the Khan-i-Khanan reached Sakrigali, Daud Khan becoming helpless fled to Orissa. And some of the grandees of Akbar, like Rajah Todar Mal and others, who had taken the route to Orissa in pursuit of him, were twice vanquished by Junaid Khan, son of Daud Khan, Munim Khan, hearing of this, himself marched to Orissa. Daud Khan advanced to encounter the latter; when both the forces approached each other, they fell into battle-array.\n\n1 There is a Dariap\u00fbr about 2 miles south of Mokamah railway gh\u00e2t station. This was probably the point up to which the Emperor Akbar advanced from Patna on boats in pursuit of Daud Shah, the king of Bengal. With the fall of the forts of Patna and Hajipur, (See Badaoni, pp. 180-181, Vol. II), Behar was practically lost by Daud Shah, who under the Peace of Katak subsequently ceded Bengal also.\n\n2 The route appears to have been through Bardwan across Madaran and Midnipur to parganah Chittua in Orissa, where Todar Mal was subsequently joined by Munim Khan. Daud Khan at this time advanced to Haripur lying intermediate between Orissa and Bengal (see Akbarnamah).\n\n3 At this time the Khan-i-Khanan was at Tandah, opposite to Gaur, settling political matters. On receiving Todar Mal\u2019s appeal for help, the Khan-i-Khanan promptly left Tandah, and quickly advanced to Orissa across Birbh\u00fbm, Bardwan and Midnipur into parganah Chittua in Orissa, where Todar Mal was.\n\n4 See Akbarnamah, Tabaqat-i-Akbari, Badaoni, for full particulars of this battle. The Akbarnamah places the battle in a village called Takadhi or Takroi (two miles from the bank of the Soobanarika river and close to Jalesar). Professor Blochmann has traced also a village called Mughulmari (or Mughal\u2019s Flight) close to this Takroi or Tookroei. (See Blochmann\u2019s Tr. of Ain, Vol. I, p. 375, and also Badasouli, p. 193, Vol. II.)\n\nTodar Mal says Professor Blochmann \u201cmoved from Bardwan over Madaran into the pargana of Chittua, where he was subsequently joined by Munim. Daud had taken up a strong position at Haripur which lies between Bengal and Orissa. Battle took place on 3rd March, 1575 A.D. After the battle, Todar Mal leads the pursuit, and reaches the town of Bhadrak. Not long after he\nThe heroes arrayed themselves on the battle-field,\nAll were armed with daggers, arrows and spears.\nOn two sides the two armies sprang up like mountains,\nOne without terror, the other with terror.\nAll vied with each other,\nAnd charged, and themselves were charged with guns,\narrows and spears.\nFrom the blood of the heroes of both the armies,\nFlowed a torrent on that battle-field.\nOn the field fell many a slaughtered,\nOn both sides, towered heaps of corpses.\n\nAn Afgh\u0101n named Gujra, who in heroism and valour was the Rustam of his time, and who commanded the van of D\u0101ud Kh\u0101n's army, made a bold onslaught on the commander of the Kh\u0101n-i-Kh\u0101n\u0101n's van, named Kh\u0101n-i-\u2018Al\u012bm, discomfited the Imperial vanguard, slew Kh\u0101n \u2018Al\u012bm, and shook the van. And a number of Imperialists who were between the centre and the van, becoming discomfited by the attack of D\u0101ud Kh\u0101n, reeled back to the centre, and caused confusion. The Kh\u0101n-i-Kh\u0101n\u0101n, with the small remnant of troops that yet held the ground, advanced in front of Gujra, and by chance, Gujra and the Kh\u0101n-i-Kh\u0101n\u0101n encountered each other.\n\nWhen the two heroes encountered each other,\nThey unsheathed from both sides dazzling swords.\nNow one, and then the other, inflicted sword-cuts,\nWorthy of heroes.\nThe one did not succeed in penetrating the cuirass,\nThe other defended himself with a shield.\nAt length, by the sword of Gujra,\nThe body of the Kh\u0101n-i-Kh\u0101n\u0101n got wounded.\nOther adherents came in the midst,\nAnd intervened between the two combatants.\n\nwrites to Munim to come up and join him, as D\u0101ud had collected his troops near Katak, and the whole Imperial army moves to Katak, where a peace is concluded.\u201d\n\n1 When Bayazid was killed by Hanso, it is related in the Sawan\u012bh Akbar\u012b that Gujra Kh\u0101n attempted to raise in Behar Bayazid's son to the throne. It may be noted that a village called Gujarpur lies about 5 miles from Katak, and that there is a family there that claims Gujra Kh\u0101n as its ancestor.\nThe Kh\u0101n-i-Kh\u0101n\u0101n, in that plight fighting, retired from the battle-field and halted, and when the scattered Mughal forces again rallied round him, he again advanced to fight with Gujra.\n\nWhen Gujra a second time came to fight,\nFrom the aim of destiny, the bow became stretched,\nWhen the arrow hit him clean on the forehead,\nThe arrow passed right through the head.\nGujra fell on the field like a mountain,\nBy his fall, his army became dispirited.\nWhen fortune turned its face from D\u0101ud Kh\u0101n,\nFrom every side, misfortune hemmed him in.\nD\u0101ud Kh\u0101n fled from the battle,\nAs he no longer dreamt of victory.\n\nD\u0101ud Kh\u0101n, leaving behind the war-elephants and other armaments, in despair fled from the battle-field. And Rajah Todar Mal and other Imperial grandees marched in pursuit\u00b9 of D\u0101ud Kh\u0101n. When D\u0101ud Kh\u0101n reached the environs of the river Chin,\u00b2 he took refuge in the fort of Katak. Since every avenue of escape was closed, he was obliged to place his family and children inside the Fort, and then himself advanced to fight, putting the coffin on the shoulder, and preparing to die. Rajah Todar Mal communicated to the Kh\u0101n Kh\u0101n\u0101n the state of affairs. Although wounded, the Kh\u0101n Kh\u0101n\u0101n on the wings of swiftness proceeded to that place. But D\u0101ud Kh\u0101n negociated terms of peace through the mediation of one of the Omra; and\n\n\u00b9 It appears from the Akbarnamah that after the battle of Takroi, Todar Mal pursued D\u0101ud Kh\u0101n up to Bhadrek, whilst Mun'im Kh\u0101n the Kh\u0101n-i-Khan\u0101n owing to his wounds still lay behind. At this time D\u0101ud Kh\u0101n collected his troops at Katak, and so Todar Mal wrote to Mun'im Kh\u0101n to come up, and Mun'im Kh\u0101n in spite of his wounds, moved up with the whole Imperial army to Katak, when the Peace of Katak was concluded. Under it, D\u0101ud Kh\u0101n formally resigned the sovereignty of Behar and Bengal to Akbar, retaining only Orissa. The battle of Takroi (3rd March, 1575 A.C.)\u2014called by Badaoni 'Bichw\u0101\u2014was a most decisive battle, as it virtually ended Afghan supremacy in Bengal and Behar, and substituted Mughal rule in its place.\n\n\u00b2 \"Chin\" is apparently a copyist's mistake for the \"Mahanadi\" river. In shekista writing, the words 'Chin' and Mahanadi in Persian might resemble each other.\nwhen the basis of the treaty \\(^1\\) was settled, he went to meet Mun'im Kh\u0101n. The Kh\u0101n Kh\u0101n\u0101n, showing chivalry and generosity, presented to him a belt, a dagger, and a sword set in jewels, left to him the province of Orissa and Katak Benares, and himself (on behalf of the Emperor) taking possession of other parts of the kingdom, returned with triumph and pomp, entered the city of Tandah, and set himself to administer the country. Since in former days, from the time of Mu\u1e25ammad Bakhtiar Khilji down to the time of Sher Sh\u0101h, Ga\u016br had formed the Capital of Bengal, (though owing to the climate of the latter place not suiting foreigners, the Afgh\u0101ns had built Khawaspur Tandah for the settlement of the rulers), the Kh\u0101n Kh\u0101n\u0101n, setting himself to the reconstruction of the city of Ga\u016br, proceeded to the latter place, and built it anew, and made it his head-quarters. Soon after, owing to the badness of its climate, he fell ill, and on the 19th Rajab, 983 A.H.\\(^2\\) died. D\u0101ud Kh\u0101n, on hearing the news of the Kh\u0101n Kh\u0101n\u0101n's death, with the assistance of the Afgh\u0101ns, re-occupied Bengal and Behar, and immediately marched to wrest the city of Khawaspur Tandah. The Imperialists, not being able to tarry, evacuated the place. D\u0101ud Kh\u0101n with full independence resumed his former sovereignty.\n\n---\n\n**THE RULE OF NAW\u0100B KH\u0100N JAH\u0100N IN BENGAL, AND AN ACCOUNT OF D\u0100UD KH\u0100N'S DEATH.**\n\nWhen the news of Mun'im Kh\u0101n, Kh\u0101n Kh\u0101n\u0101n's death reached Delhi, Emperor Akbar appointed Husain Quli Kh\u0101n\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Under this treaty of Katak, Behar and Bengal were formally ceded by D\u0101ud Sh\u0101h, the Afghan king of Bengal, to the Mughal Emperor (Akbar), Orissa being still retained by D\u0101ud Sh\u0101h. Badaoni gives an interesting description of the Darbar held on the occasion by Mun'im Kh\u0101n Kh\u0101n Khanan, across the Mahanadi river, opposite to the fort of Katak (Outtack). Both Mun'im and D\u0101ud showed refined chivalry and magnanimity towards each other, at this State function.\n\n\\(^2\\) Corresponding to 1576 A.C.\n\nProfessor Blochmann, in his Tr. of Ain-i-Akbari, Vol. I, p. 376, gives a list (compiled from the Akbarnamah) of 14 other principal Mughal officers who died at Ga\u016br of malaria at this time (983 A.H. or 1576 A.C.) Badaoni also gives the list.\nTurkman, after bestowing on him the title of Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n,\u00b9 to the office of Governor of Bengal. And when Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n reached the frontiers of Bengal, Khw\u0101jah Muzaffar Ali Turbati,\u00b2 who was a servant of Bahr\u0101m\u00b3 Kh\u0101n, and, obtaining the title of Muzaffar Kh\u0101n, was Governor of Beh\u0101r, and had come for the conquest of the Rohtas fort, joined him with the troops of Beh\u0101r, Tirhut and Hajipur, &c. And all the Imperialists uniting their forces, advanced to storm the fort of Teliagadhi and Sakrigali. D\u0101ud Kh\u0101n also with a formidable army advanced to Akmahal,\u2074 which lies midway between Gadh\u012b and Tandah, to fight with Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n. But Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n, by delivery of the first assault, stormed Gadh\u012b, slaughtered about 1,500 Afgh\u0101ns, and advanced towards the site where D\u0101ud Kh\u0101n was entrenched. When the distance\n\n\u00b9 He was appointed in 983 A.H. (1576 A.C.) by Akbar Military Governor of Bengal, on the death of Mun'im Kh\u0101n Kh\u0101n-i-Kh\u0101n\u0101n. His second-in-command was Rajah Todar Mal. He was a sister's son of Bairam Kh\u0101n Kh\u0101n-i-Kh\u0101n\u0101n. See his biographical sketch in Bloehmann's Tr. of Ain-i-Akbari, Vol. I, p. 329, and also Maasir-ul-Umara.\n\nAt Bhagalpur, the Amirs of Bengal waited on Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n.\n\nFrom this period the whole of Beh\u0101r, including South and North Beh\u0101r, was placed under a separate Mughal Governor, whilst Bengal was similarly governed by another separate Mughal Governor. The Governorship of Beh\u0101r generally henceforth formed a sort of stepping-stone for the more responsible and lucrative office of Governor of Bengal (see the text).\n\n\u00b2 \"Tirhuti\" is a copyist's mistake in the text for \"Turbati.\" He was Akbar's Governor of Beh\u0101r, and held all Beh\u0101r from Chausa to Teliagadhi. He was ordered by Akbar to assist Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n, Akbar's Governor of Bengal, when the latter encountered opposition from the Afgh\u0101ns under D\u0101ud Kh\u0101n, who had at this time entrenched himself in the fort of Akmahal (subsequently, Rajmahal or Akbarnagar). He was at one time Finance Minister or Dewan of Akbar, and had Todar Mal under him. He, together with his Deputy, Todar Mal, was the author of Akbar's revenue-roll called \"jam-i-hasil-i-hal,\" which supplanted the former revenue-roll of the Emperor, called 'Jami Raqmi,' that had existed from Bairam's time. He was previously Bairam's Dewan also. The old Jam-i-Masjid (now in ruins) of Agra was erected by him. He was killed at Tandah by Mas\u012bm Kh\u0101n, the rebel. (See his full biographical sketch in Bloehmann's Tr. of Ain-i-Akbari, Vol. I, p. 348, and also Maasir-ul-Umara).\n\n\u00b3 \"Bahram\" is a copyist's mistake in the text for \"Bairam.\"\n\n\u2074 i.e., Rajmahal or Akbarnagar\u2014Previous to Man Singh selecting it, Sher Sh\u0101h had selected its site.\nbetween was covered, on the 15th Muharram, 983 A.H., which was a Thursday, both the contending hosts arrayed their forces in battle-rank.\n\nThe two armies fell into battle-array;\nThe warriors became anxious to fight.\nWhen the market of fight and combat became warm,\nThe warriors drew against each other sharp swords.\nFrom the thundering of guns, and the raging of war-rockets,\nThe sky itself quaked.\n\nKal\u0101 P\u0101h\u0101r who was one of the renowned generals of D\u0101ud Kh\u0101n, attacking the right wing of Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n, spread consternation, and Muzaffar Kh\u0101n assaulting the left wing of D\u0101ud Kh\u0101n, caused it to reel back, and simultaneously, Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n assaulted the centre of D\u0101ud Kh\u0101n, and a great battle commenced.\n\nOn that battle-field, mutual fightings occurred:\nBoth the armies lost numbers of men.\nFrom the numbers of the killed, mounds were raised,\nAnd signs of the Day of Resurrection appeared.\nThe renowned hero, Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n, in the battle,\nReduced to dust the army of D\u0101ud:\nWhichever side he raised his sword,\nHe severed the head of the enemy from the body.\nAnd from this side, D\u0101ud with the sharp sword,\nCaused havoc in the army of Kh\u0101n J\u0101h\u0101n:\nWhichever side he turned with his sword,\nHe felled on his feet the helmet of the enemy's head.\nIf he struck a horse with his sharp sword,\nIt was ripped into two pieces up to the bow of the saddle.\n\n1 \"Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n\" was a title next in importance to \"Kh\u0101n-i-Kh\u0101n\u0101n.\"\n\n2 This was the decisive battle of Akmahal or Agmahal (subsequently called Rajmahal or Akbarnagar), on 15th Rabi II 984 A.H., corresponding to 12th July, 1576 A.C. It finally crushed D\u0101ud Sh\u0101h or D\u0101ud Kh\u0101n, the last Afghan king of Bengal, Behar and Orissa, and laid firmly the foundation of Mughal supremacy over those provinces, reduced Bengal to a S\u016bbah of the Great Mughal Empire, and extinguished forever Independent Moslem Royalty in Bengal.\n\nSee full account of this great battle in the Akbarnamah and Badoni, which are contemporary accounts.\nAnd if he struck a spear on the chest of any person,\nIts point passed right through his back:\nBy the strength of arm, that furious lion\nKilled many, and squeezed many.\nBut as fortune did not favour him,\nHe could not stand his ground on the battle-field.\nHe was vanquished, and he lost his treasures and effects,\nMisfortune, like a post-boy, ran towards him.\n\nWhen the eagle of victory and triumph cast its shadow on\nthe army of Emperor Akbar, and D\u0101ud Kh\u0101n fled from the battle-\nfield, the heroes of Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n's army, not abandoning D\u0101nd's\npursuit, followed him up, and at length D\u0101ud Kh\u0101n was captured,\nand brought to Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n. The latter, considering D\u0101ud's life\nto be a source of disturbance and insurrection, ordered him to\nbe killed.\u00b9\n\nHis head was cut off with the sharp sword,\nFrom the blood of D\u0101ud, the ground underneath reddened.\nThe Royal throne (of Bengal) became emptied of kings,\nFrom Bengal, Royalty vanished!\n\nJunaid Kh\u0101n, son of D\u0101nd Kh\u0101n, who receiving a mortal\nwound, had fled from the battle-field, some two or three days\nsubsequently also died. Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n reduced to subjection as\nmuch of the country as was in the possession of the Kh\u0101n-i-\nKh\u0101n\u0101n, and sent all the elephants captured from the Afgh\u0101ns,\ntogether with other booty, to Emperor Akbar. And Muzaffar\nKh\u0101n, striking up the kettle-drum of return, proceeded to Patn\u0101,\nand in 984 A.H., turned to the conquest of the fort of Rohtas.\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 One cannot help noting the entire absence of chivalry on the part of\nthis Mughal General, Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n. If he possessed one-quarter of the\nchivalry of his own predecessor in office, the Kh\u0101n-i-Kh\u0101n\u0101n, he could have\nnever extended his hand to the perpetration of this brutality, which was as\nferocious as it was ungallant. A worthy and heroic foe like D\u0101ud Sh\u0101h\ndeserved a better fate, and it is a pity that Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n's master, the Great\nAkbar, should not have provided against such a misdeed, which must reflect\nadversely on the Emperor's memory itself.\n\n\u00b2 This renowned Fort in South Behar in 945 A.H. passed into the hands\nof Sher Sh\u0101h. (See Badaoni for a description of it, as it existed in Akbar's\ntime). During his reign and that of his son Salim Sh\u0101h, Fath Kh\u0101n\nBatni commanded the Fort. Subsequently, it came into the hands of Sulai.\nAN ACCOUNT OF THE EXTIRPATION OF CERTAIN GRANDEES OF D\u0100UD KH\u0100N.\n\nWhen Mu\u1e93affar Kh\u0101n planned to return to Patna, on the way he detached Muhammad Ma\u1e63um Kh\u0101n\u00b9 to conquer Husain Kh\u0101n\u00b2 Afghan who was in those parts, and he causing Husain Kh\u0101n to flee, came to the Parganna which was his jagir, and entered the fort. And K\u0101l\u0101 P\u0101h\u0101r coming with 800 corps of cavalry, besieged Ma\u1e63um Kh\u0101n. The latter seeing a breach made, battered down the rear-wall of the fort, sallied out, and gave battle to K\u0101l\u0101 P\u0101h\u0101r. As ill-luck would have it, in the heat of warfare, the war-elephant of K\u0101l\u0101 P\u0101h\u0101r, with its trunk, flung down Ma\u1e63um Kh\u0101n\u2019s horse, and threw down Ma\u1e63um Kh\u0101n on the ground. In the meantime, the Mughal archers hit the elephant-driver with the arrow, and the elephant, being without its driver, turned round and attacked its own army, and killed and trampled down numerous Afghans. From this cause, the Afghans were vanquished, K\u0101l\u0101 P\u0101h\u0101r was killed, and his elephant turned back. The province of Orissa and Katak, Benares, the whole kingdom of Bengal and Behar, by the efforts of Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n, were annexed to the Empire of Akbar; and the fortune of the kings of Bengal terminated, and no other king in that kingdom thenceforth minted coins, or had the Khutbah read after his name. And the leading Afghan grandees, like Husain Kh\u0101n and K\u0101l\u0101 P\u0101h\u0101r, as related above, were totally extirpated, and some fled to the jungles in the tracts of Bengal.\u00b3\n\n\u00b9 He fought against K\u0101l\u0101 P\u0101h\u0101r. See particulars of his career in Bloch, Tr. of Ain, Vol. I, p. 431 n. and also in Badaoni and Massir-ul-Umara.\n\n\u00b2 See p. 439, Bloch. Tr., Ain, Vol. I.\n\n\u00b3 After the battle of Akmahal or Rajmahal (1576 A.C.), in which the last independent Afghan king of Bengal, Behar and Orissa, named D\u0101ud Sh\u0101h, was defeated and killed, Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n proceeded to Satgaon, where D\u0101ud\u2019s family lived at the time, \u2018defeated remnants of D\u0101ud\u2019s followers under Jamshid and Mitti, and re-annexed Satgaon to the Mughal Empire. D\u0101ud\u2019s mother came to Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n as a supplicant. . . With the defeat and death\nyear 987 A.H., Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n died,\u00b9 and the Afgh\u0101ns, whose names and traces had been lost, now issued out from all corners, and tried to re-occupy and re-conquer the country. Amongst these, one principal Afgh\u0101n commander, named \u2018Osm\u0101n Kh\u0101n, combining with other Afgh\u0101ns, raised an insurrection. Emperor Akbar appointed Kh\u0101n \u2018Az\u012bm Mirz\u0101 Kokah,\u00b2 together with other principal Omr\u0101, to the Government of Bengal and Beh\u0101r. And he made meedworthy efforts to destroy and extirpate the Afgh\u0101ns. And when he did not succeed in completely extirpating them, Sh\u0101hb\u0101z Kh\u0101n\u00b3 came with re-inforcements, as an auxiliary to the Imperialists; and then engagements ensued with \u2018Osm\u0101n Kh\u0101n. The ferocious Imperialists did not stay their hands from the slaughter, capture and extirpation of the insurgent Afgh\u0101ns. In short, in the life-time of Akbar, the fortune of the Afgh\u0101ns declined, but as their extirpation was not completed by the time of the death of Emperor Akbar, which took place in 1014 A.H., \u2018Osm\u0101n Kh\u0101n rising again, re-sharpened his sword. And mobilising nearly of D\u0101nd, Bengal was by no means thoroughly conquered, as troubles broke out in Bhati (Sundarbans including tracts along the Megna), where the Afgh\u0101ns had collected under Karim Dad, Ibr\u0101h\u012bm and \u2018\u012asa Kh\u0101n, whom Abul Fas\u012bl calls: \u201cMarzban-i-Bhati.\u201d (See \u0100in-i-Akbar\u012b, Bloch, Tr., Vol. I, pp. 330 and 343).\n\n\u00b9 He died at a town called S\u012bhatpur (the \u2018Sanitarium\u2019) which he had founded near Tandah.\n\n\u00b2 In 988 A.H. Aziz was promoted by Akbar to command of Five Thousand, received the title of Asam Kh\u0101n, and was in 988 A.H. detached with a large army to Bengal and Beh\u0101r, to quell disturbances. In 990 A.H. he was again sent there, when he occupied Teliagadhi, the \u201ckey\u201d to Bengal. He fought against the rebels Ma\u2019sum-i-Kabuli and Majnun Kh\u0101n, and also operated against the Afgh\u0101n Qutlu, who had occupied Orissa and a portion of Bengal. He took ill, retired to Beh\u0101r, leaving the command in Bengal to Sh\u0101hb\u0101z Kh\u0101n Kamb\u016b. Of him, Akbar used to say \u201cBetween me and Aziz is a river of milk which I cannot cross.\u201d (See Blochmann\u2019s Tr., \u0100in, Vol. I, p. 325 for details of his career and also Maasir-ul-Umara).\n\n\u00b3 For interesting details of his career see Blochmann\u2019s Tr., \u0100in-i-Akbar\u012b, Vol. I, p. 399 and Maasir-ul-Umara. Ma\u2019sum Kh\u0101n Kabuli rebelled, fled to Bhati, and took refuge with the Marzban-i-Bhati, \u2018\u012asa Kh\u0101n. Sh\u0101hb\u0101z Kh\u0101n followed him to Bhati, crossed the Ganges at Khizrpur (near Narain-ganj) plundered Bakhtiarpur, \u2018\u012asa Kh\u0101n\u2019s residence, occupied Sunargaon and encamped on the banks of the Brahmaputra. \u2018\u012asa Kh\u0101n made proposals of peace which were accepted: under it, an Imperial Resident was to stay at Sunargaon, Ma\u2019sum was to go to Mecca, and Sh\u0101hb\u0101z was to withdraw. But these terms were not carried out, as his officers showed insubordination, and Sh\u0101hb\u0101z had to retreat to Tandah.\n20,000 Afghans, he had the Khutba in that tract read after his name, and from the pride of being at the head of numerous followers, he became aggressive. And taking no account of the Imperial officers who were stationed in this country, he raised his hand of conquest on the Imperial dominions.\n\nNow I adorn my rarity-depicting pen with the chronicle of the accounts of the Nazims of Bengal, who were honoured with the khillat of the Nizamat of Bengal from the lofty presence of the Chagta\u00ef\u00b9 Emperors, and who raising the standard of authority, freed this country from the weeds and thorns of rebellions.\n\n\u00b9 i.e., Mughal Emperors. See note ante.\nCHAPTER III.\n\nAN ACCOUNT OF THE RULE OF THE NAZIMS WHO WERE APPOINTED TO THE NI\u1e92\u0100MAT OF BENGAL BY THE TIMURIDE EMPERORS OF DELHI.\n\nNI\u1e92\u0100MAT OR VICEROYALTY OF RAJAH M\u0100N SINGH.\n\nWhen on the 19th Jam\u0101di-ul-S\u0101ni 1014 A.H., Nuru-d-d\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad Jah\u0101ng\u012br B\u0101dsh\u0101h, in the fort of Agra, ascended the Imperial throne, inasmuch as from official despatches, news-letters, and the correspondence of officers, news of the insurrection of \u2018Ogm\u0101n Kh\u0101n was continually received, on the very day of his accession, the Emperor, bestowing rich khillat with chargal, and a sword set in jewel, and a splendid horse, appointed Rajah M\u0101n Singh to the Ni\u1e93\u0101mat of the \u1e62ub\u0101\u1e6d of Bengal, whilst Waz\u012br Kh\u0101n was exalted to the office of Diw\u0101n and Auditor of this Province.\u00b9 After their arrival in this country, the refractory \u2018Ogm\u0101n advanced to fight, and a battle ensued. \u2018Ogm\u0101n with great shrewdness opened secret negotiations. As the war was protracted, and the extirpation of the Afgh\u0101ns was not accomplished, in that very year of accession, R\u0101jah M\u0101n Sing \u00b2 was recalled from office, and\n\n\u00b9 For the first time, we hear of the offices of Nagim and Diwan. Hitherto we heard of Military Governors, called \u201cSipasalars\u201d or \u201cSirlashkars\u201d or \u201cHakims\u201d appointed by the Mughal Emperor. It is obvious that, hitherto, Bengal under the Mughals was under a sort of Military Government, presided over by Military Governors. When the back-bone of Afghan opposition was broken, in the time of Emperor Jahangir, for the first time, under Mughal rule, Bengal was placed under Civil Government by the Mughal Emperors, who appointed two distinct functionaries, one being the Na\u1e63im (in charge of executive government) and the other, the Diwan (in charge of Revenue and Finance). This system of Government, though actually enforced in Bengal in Jahangir\u2019s time, must have been matured towards the end of Akbar\u2019s reign.\n\n\u00b2 He was a son of Bhagwan Das, and Akbar bestowed on him the title of \u201cFarsand\u201d or \u201cSon,\u201d and raised him to the Mansab of Haft Hazari. See full\nQu\u1e6dbu-d-din Kh\u0101n Kokalt\u0101sh was exalted to his place, being the recipient at the same time of khil\u2019ats with a belt set in jewels, and of a horse with gold-mounted saddle. The Viceroyalty of Rajah M\u0101n Singh lasted eight months and a few days.\n\nNIZ\u0100MAT OF QU\u1e6cBU-D-D\u012aN KH\u0100N.\n\nWhen Qu\u1e6dbu-d-din Kokalt\u0101sh,\u00b9 on the 9th \u1e62afar, 1015 A.H., was honoured with the khil\u2019at of the Niz\u0101mat of Bengal, he was raised to the rank of a Panjhaz\u0101r\u012b, with 5,000 soldiers and troopers; and 2 lacs of rupees was given him for his allowance, and 3 lacs of rupees was given for the expenses of his contingent. After taking leave of the Emperor, he arrived in Bengal. As yet some months had not passed, when he was killed at the hands of \u2018Ali Quli Beg Astajl\u016b, styled Sher Afghan Kh\u0101n.\u00b2 And the detail of particulars of his career in Bloch. Tr. of \u0100m, Vol. I, p. 340, and also in Maasir-ul-Umara, and Iqbalnamah-i-Jahangiri.\n\n\u00b9 His name was Shaikh Khuba [Qu\u1e6dbu-d-din Kh\u0101n-i-Chishti] and his father was Shaikh Zada of Badson, and his mother a daughter of Shaikh Salim of Fathpur Sikri. He was a foster-brother of Jahangir, who whilst a Prince conferred upon Khuba the title of Qu\u1e6dbu-d-din Kh\u0101n, and made him S\u016bbadar of Behar. On Jahangir\u2019s accession to the throne, Khuba was appointed S\u016bbadar of Bengal, (1015 A.H.) At that time Sher Afghan \u2018Ali Quli Istajl\u016b was tug\u0101ldar (or jagirdar) of Bardwan, and his wife Mehrunnissa (afterwards Empress Nur Jahan) was coveted by Emperor Jahangir. Qu\u1e6dbu-d-din had instructions to send Sher Afghan to court, but the latter refusing to go, Qu\u1e6db went to Bardwan, where Sher Afghan came to meet him. On his approach, Qu\u1e6db lifted up his horse-whip. Sher Afghan thereon rushed with his sword against Qu\u1e6db, and inflicted a cut on his abdomen. Qu\u1e6db died, and one of his followers Ambah Kh\u0101n, gave Sher Afghan a sword-cut on the head, when the latter was also killed. (Bloch. Tr., \u0100m, Vol. I, p. 496 and Iqbalnamah-i-Jahangiri, p. 19).\n\n\u00b2 He was safarchi or butler of Ismail II, king of Persia. After the latter\u2019s death, he went to India, and met at Multan, Abdur Rahim Kh\u0101n-i-Khan\u0101n, and received a mansab, and on arrival at court, Akbar gave him in marriage to Mehrunnissa (the future Nur Jah\u0101n), daughter of Mirza Ghiy\u0101s Tehr\u0101n\u012b. Prince Salim fell in love with her, and brought about, on his accession to the throne, Sher Afghan\u2019s death. Sher Afghan had received Bardwan district as tug\u0101l or jagir, on Jahangir\u2019s accession. His body was buried in the shrine of the saint Bahram Saqq\u0101 at Bardwan. (See Iqbalnamah, p. 22).\n\nFour tigers had been caught, and Nur Jah\u0101n requested Jahangir (Tuzuk, p. 186), to let her shoot them. She killed two with one bullet, and the other\nthis incident is this. 'Ali Quli Beg Astajl\u016b was a butler of Sh\u0101h Ism\u0101'il, son of Sh\u0101h Tahmasp \u0160af\u0101vi. On the death of Sh\u0101h Ism\u0101'il, coming to India via Qandah\u0101r, at Multan he entered the service of 'Abdur Rahim Kh\u0101n, Kh\u0101n Kh\u0101n\u0101n, who was then employed on the conquest of Thatah and Sindh. The Kh\u0101n Kh\u0101n\u0101n informally enlisted him in the ranks of Imperial officers, and in that expedition, 'Ali Quti shewed bravery and rendered valuable services. When the Kh\u0101n Kh\u0101n\u0101n from that expedition returned triumphant to the Imperial presence, at his request, 'Ali Quli was honoured with an appropriate Mansab, and at the same time, a daughter of Mirz\u0101 Ghiy\u0101s Beg Tehr\u0101ni, named Mehrunnissa, was wedded to him. And at the time when Emperor Akbar proceeded from Akbarabad (Agra) to the conquest of the Dakhin, and the Crown-Prince (Prince Salim, afterwards Emperor Jah\u0101ngir), was ordered to undertake the subjugation of the R\u0101na of Udaipur, 'Ali Quli Beg was appointed as an auxiliary to the Prince. The Prince,\n\ntwo with two bullets, and so one of the courtiers spoke out on the spur of the moment the verse given in the text. See Bloch.

After his father's death, Ghiy\u0101s Beg fled from Persia with two sons and one daughter. On the way at Qandahar, his wife gave birth to a daughter, named Mehrunnissa\u2014the future world-renowned N\u016br Jah\u0101n, consort of Emperor Jah\u0101ngir. On his arrival at Fathpur Sikri, Akbar appointed him Diw\u0101n of Kabul, and subsequently Diw\u0101n-i-Bay\u016bt\u0101t. In Jah\u0101ngir's reign, he received the title of Itimadu-d-daulah. After the death of her first husband, Sher Afghan, at Bardwan in the fight with Qutbu-d-din Kh\u0101n, Jah\u0101ngir's Governor of Bengal, Mehrunnissa was brought to court, and married in 1020 A.H. by Jah\u0101ngir, who bestowed on her first the title of N\u016br Mah\u0101l and then that of N\u016br Jah\u0101n, her father Ghiy\u0101s Beg being at the same time advanced to the office of Prime Minister or Vakil-i-Kul.

(See Jarrett's Tr. of \u0100in, Vol. II, p. 273). It is related that a daughter of Naushirvan, the Persian king, whose wife was a daughter of Maurice of Constantinople, was married into the Udaipur Royal family.\nshewing every attention to him, gave him the title of Sher Afghan, and on accession to the throne, bestowing on him a Jagir at Bardwan in the S\u016bbah of Bengal, he sent him there. Afterwards, when the crookedness of his conduct, his wickedness and ill-temper became known to the Emperor, the latter, whilst sending Qutb Kh\u0101n to Bengal, gave the latter a hint that if he found Sher Afghan well-behaved and loyal, well and good, but if otherwise, he should send him to the Imperial presence, and that in coming if he made excuses, he should punish him. When Qutb-u-d-din Kh\u0101n reached Bengal, he was dissatisfied with Sher Afghan\u2019s action and conduct. Although he summoned the latter to his presence, putting forward idle excuses, he did not attend. Qutb-u-d-din Kh\u0101n communicated the matter to the Emperor, who ordered that agreeably to the injunctions conveyed at the time of his departure, he should punish Sher Afghan. The above Kh\u0101n, on receipt of the Imperial order, instantly marched swiftly to Bardwan. Sher Afghan on getting news of the arrival of the above Kh\u0101n, advanced forward with two grooms to receive him. At the time of meeting, the soldiers of Qutb-u-d-din Kh\u0101n crowding in stood at a distance, like a ring. Sher Afghan said: \u201cWhat is this treatment, and what does it mean?\u201d The Kh\u0101n told his soldiers to disperse, moved alone in Sher Afghan\u2019s company, and commenced conversation. Sher Afghan read signs of treachery in the aspect of affairs, and forestalling the other, he thought it prudent to apply the remedy before the disease appeared, and with great agility hit Qutb-u-d-din on the abdomen with a sword, so that the latter\u2019s entrails came out. The Kh\u0101n seizing his abdomen with both hands, shouted out: \u201cDon\u2019t spare him, don\u2019t let this wretch escape.\u201d A Kashmirian, named Aina Kh\u0101n, who was one of Qutb\u2019s principal officers, spurring his horse, struck Sher Afghan with a sword on the head. In that plight, Sher Afghan with another blow finished Aina Kh\u0101n\u2019s work. At this moment, the soldiers of Qutb-u-d-din Kh\u0101n collecting from all sides, killed Sher Afghan also, by inflicting successive cuts. Sher Afghan Kh\u0101n is that person,\n\n1 He was a stout man, and one can well imagine his pitiful posture at this moment.\n\n2 He is called Pir Kh\u0101n, also \u201cRaibah Kh\u0101n\u201d and \u201cDaibah Kh\u0101n\u201d in Iqbalnamah-i-Jah\u0101ngiri, p. 24.\nwhose widow, N\u016br Jah\u0101n,\\(^1\\) as Consort of Emperor Jah\u0101ngir, is so renowned.

He was a son of Shaikh Mubarak; held the office of Prime Minister under Akbar and actively co-operated with the latter in the enunciation of a liberal policy of toleration in the government of the mixed races subject to the Musalman Rule in India. He was a great scholar, and author of several works including the Akbarnamah and the Ain-i-Akbari.

When these reached the frontiers of the tract under 'Osm\u0101n, they first deputed a sagacious envoy to conciliate the refractory mind of the leader of the insurrection. They strung the precious pearl of good advice to the ear-corner of his heart. Inasmuch as that wretched man ('Osm\u0101n Kh\u0101n) was by inherent nature a bad stuff, and had not the capacity of appreciating goodness, not appraising the value of this pearl of advice, he collected brickbats of vain aspirations in the vessel of his bad luck, and in the face of that shining pearl, he put forward the stature of his wild ambition, gave permission to the envoy to withdraw without accomplishing his mission, and preparing to die, spurred swiftly the horse of aggressiveness and fighting, and\n\nin 1027 A.H. was Governor of Behar.

His residence is mentioned in the histories (see Bloch, Ain, Vol. I, p. 520) to have been at \"Kohistan-i-Dacca,\" the \"Vilayet-i-Dacca,\" but his father 'Isa Kh\u0101n's residence (vide p. 343 of do.) is mentioned to have been at Baktarapur, close to Khizrpur. Khizrpur has been identified with a place about a mile north of modern Narsinganj, close to which are ruins of the forts built by Mir Jumla, Mughal Viceroy at Dacca, in the 17th century. There is still there a Maqbarah, which is supposed to be the resting-place of one of Jahangir's daughters. Here was the chief naval fort of Muhammadan Government, it lay at the confluence of the Ganges, the Lakhya and the Brahmaputra rivers. It is three miles west of Sunargaon, and nine miles from Dacca. About thirty miles north of Khizrpur, are two villages within a mile of each other, called \"Baktarpur\" and \"Issurpur,\" but these contain no ruins. (See J.A.S. for 1874, pp. 211-213). \"Bhati\" from its inaccessibility was elected as the last stronghold of the Afghans, who, sheltered amidst its jungles, cut up by numerous rivers and channels, long defied there the power of the Mughals. During the Mughal military revolt under Akbar, the chief rebel, Mas\u016bm Kh\u0101n Kabuli, who was a Turbati Syed and whose uncle had been Vazir under Hum\u0101y\u016bn, took refuge in \"Bhati,\" where he fought against Musaffar and Shahbaz, and at length died in 1007 A.H.

When news of this daring impudence reached Jah\u0101ng\u012br's officers, in the seventh year of accession, towards the end of the month of Zilhaj, 1020 A.H., the latter arrayed their forces, and advanced to the field of warfare. From the other side, 'Osm\u0101n Kh\u0101n also arrayed his miscreant troops for battle on the field of adversity, in front of the auspicious Imperialists.

Syed Adam Barha\\(^3\\) and Shaikh Acha\\(^4\\) who were Commanders of the Imperial vanguard, fell gallantly fighting. At this moment, the flanks of both the armies came into line. Iftikhar Kh\u0101n,\\(^5\\) Commander of the left wing, and Keshwar Kh\u0101n,\\(^6\\) Commander of the right wing, with a large number\n\n---\n\n1 Probably this was the small Lakhya river, on which modern Naraiinganj is situate, and close to which were Khizpur and Baktarpur. *Iqbalnamah*, pp. 61 and 64.\n\n2 The Tuzuk (p. 102) mentions that Kishwar Kh\u0101n (son of Qutbu-d-din Kh\u0101n, late Governor of Bengal), Iftikhar Kh\u0101n, Syed Adam Barha, Shaikh Acha, brother's son of Muqqarib Kh\u0101n, Mu'tamid Kh\u0101n, and Ihtim\u0101m Kh\u0101n were under Shuj\u0101t's command in his fight with 'Osm\u0101n. Syed Adam, Iftikhar, and Shaikh Acha were killed (the Tuzuk, p. 132). Later Abdus Salam Kh\u0101n, a\nof adherents, were killed; and on the enemy's side also many passed to hell. On seeing that some of the leaders of the Imperialists had been killed, and their ranks emptied of veterans, a second time 'O\u1e63m\u0101n placing before himself the rogue elephant, named Bacha, himself mounted on a saddled elephant, personally assaulted the Imperial van, and delivered successive onsets. From the side of the Imperialists, Shuj\u0101'\u012bt Kh\u0101n, with his relations and brothers, advancing to oppose him, exhibited great bravery and heroism. Many of his relations were killed, and many retreated on receiving mortal wounds. When that elephant came in front of Shuj\u0101'\u012bt Kh\u0101n, the latter spurring his horse struck it with a spear on its trunk, and with great agility drawing the sword from his waist, inflicted two successive cuts on its head; and when he came in collision with the elephant, he drew his dagger, and inflicted on it two more cuts. The elephant, from its great ferocity, not recking of these cuts, with great fury rushed up, and flung down both the rider and the horse. Shewing agility, Shuj\u0101'\u012bt dismounted from his horse, and stood erect on the ground. At this juncture, Shuj\u0101'\u012bt's groom struck the trunk of the elephant with a double-edged sword, and inflicted a serious cut, causing the elephant to fall on its knees. Shuj\u0101'\u012bt Kh\u0101n, with the help of his groom, threw down the rider of the elephant, and with a dagger inflicted another cut on its trunk. The elephant roaring fiercely fled after this cut, and moving some paces fell down. Shuj\u0101'\u012bt Kh\u0101n's horse sprang up unhurt, and the Kh\u0101n mounted it again. In the meantime, another elephant attacking the Imperial standard-bearer threw him down with the standard.\n\nson of Muazzam Kh\u0101n (a former Governor of Bengal) joined the Imperialists, and pursued 'O\u1e63m\u0101n. See also Iqbalnamah, pp. 61 to 64.\n\n1 The author's remark is unjust and ungraceful. The Afghans under 'O\u1e63m\u0101n were fighting for their homes and hearths, and did not deserve this opprobrious expression.\n\n2 The Tuzuk calls the elephant \"Gajpat\u012b,\" Iqbalnamah (p. 62) \"Bakht\u0101h.\"\n\n3 His name was Shaikh Kabir-i-Qhisht\u012b, and his title was Shaikh Shuj\u0101'\u012bt Kh\u0101n Rustam-i-Zaman. He was a relative of Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n, Governor of Bengal and served under the latter in Bengal, and commanded the Imperialists in the fightings with 'O\u1e63m\u0101n, the Lohani Afghan. (See Bloch. Tr., \u0100in, Vol. I, p. 520, and the Tuzuk, and the Maasir and Iqbalnamah, p. 64). He was subsequently appointed Governor of Behar.\nShuj\u0101t Kh\u0101n shouted out, \"Take care, behave like a man, I am alive, and will soon advance to your rescue.\" A number of troops who were round the standard-bearer took courage, inflicted serious cuts on the elephant which fled, and placed the standard-bearer on the horse again. At this time, when the battle was lingering towards its close, and many had fallen, and many being wounded were unable to move their limbs, the Imperial fortune blazed forth, and a cannon-ball hit \u2018Osm\u0101n Kh\u0101n on the forehead, and levelled him straight on his horse. Though he realised that he could not survive this wound, still he heroically encouraged his soldiers to fight on. And when he read signs of defeat in the forehead of his fate, pulling back the rein of his adversity, with the last breathings of a dying man, he reached Bengal. And the triumphant Imperialists following him up to his camp, halted. \u2018Osm\u0101n expired at midnight. Wali Kh\u0101n, his brother, and Mamr\u012bz Kh\u0101n, his son, leaving behind the tents and the armaments, and removing his corpse, fled to their tent. Shuj\u0101t Kh\u0101n on hearing of this, thought of following up the enemy, but his advisers opposed the pursuit that day, on the ground that the troops were tired, the killed had to be buried, and the wounded dressed. In the meantime, Mu\u2019taqad Kh\u0101n, who was afterwards honoured with the title of Lashkar Kh\u0101n, \u2018Abdus-Sal\u0101m Kh\u0101n, son of \u2018Abdul Mu\u2019azzam Kh\u0101n, and other officers of the Emperor arrived with a fresh re-inforcement of 300 cavalry and 400 mus-\n\n1 Khwajah \u2018Osm\u0101n, according to the Makhzan-i-Afghani, was the second son of Miyan \u2018\u012asa Kh\u0101n Lohani, who after the death of Qutb Kh\u0101n was the leader of the Afghans in Orissa and South Bengal. \u2018Osm\u0101n succeeded his brother Sulaiman, who had 'reigned' for some time, had killed in a fight Himat Singh, son of Rajah M\u0101n Singh, and had held lands near the Brahmaputra, and subdued the Rajahs of the adjacent countries. \u2018Osm\u0101n succeeded him, and received from M\u0101n Singh lands in Orissa and Satgaon and later in Eastern Bengal, with a revenue of 6 or 6 lacs per year. His residence is described to have been at \u201cKohist\u0101n Dacca,\u201d the \u201cVil\u0101yet-i-Dacca\u201d and Dacca itself. The battle between \u2018Osm\u0101n and the Imperialist General, Shuj\u0101t, took place at a distance of 100 kos from Dacca on 9th Muharram, 1021 (or 2nd March, 1612 A.C.) Stewart places the battle on the banks of the Subarnarika in Orissa, which is improbable. \u2018Osm\u0101n\u2019s brother, Walli, on submission, received a title with a jagir, and was made a commander of one thousand. According to the Maasir he was murdered. See Bloch Tr., \u0100in, Vol. I, p. 520, Makhzan-i-Afghani and Iqbalnamah, p. 61.\n\n2 He was a Subadar of Delhi.

Wali Kh\u0101n despairing sent the following message: \"The root of this insurrection was \u2018Osm\u0101n; he has met with his deserts, we are all loyal. If we receive assurance of safety, we would make our submission and would send the elephants of \u2018Osm\u0101n, in the shape of tribute.\" Shuj\u0101t Kh\u0101n and Mu\u2019taqad Kh\u0101n, shewing chivalry, arranged terms of peace. The following day, Wali Kh\u0101n and Mamr\u012bz Kh\u0101n, with all their brothers and connexions, came to meet Shuj\u0101t Kh\u0101n, and presented forty-nine elephants as tribute. Shuj\u0101t and Mu\u2019taqad Kh\u0101n, taking charge of them, moved victorious and triumphant to Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n to Jah\u0101ngirnagar (Dacca). Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n sent a despatch containing news of the victory to the Emperor at Akbar\u0101b\u0101d (Agra). On the 16th of the month of Muharram 1021 A.H., this despatch reached the Emperor, and was perused. In recognition of this good service, Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n was raised to the man\u1e63ab of a Shashhaz\u0101ri, and Shuj\u0101t Kh\u0101n had his man\u1e63ab raised, and received the title of Rustam-i-Zam\u0101n; whilst all other Imperialists who had loyally and gallantly co-operated in the extirpation of \u2018Osm\u0101n Kh\u0101n, received similarly befitting man\u1e63abs. The insurrection of \u2018Osm\u0101n Kh\u0101n lasted eight years, and in the 7th year of the Emperor's accession, corresponding to 1022 A.H., his subjugation was accomplished. In the 8th year of the Emperor's accession, Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n led an expedition against the Mags, who were brutes in human form. Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n sent to the Emperor, in charge of his son, Hoshang Kh\u0101n, a number of the Mags that were captured, and in the same year (1022 A.H.) Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n died in Bengal. Thereupon, the Governorship of that country was entrusted to his brother, Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n.\n\nNI\u1e92\u0100MAT OF Q\u0100SIM KH\u0100N.\n\nAfter the Governorship of Bengal was conferred on Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n, brother of Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n, he ruled five years and a few months, when the Ass\u0101mese making an incursion into the conquered Imperial domains, captured and decoyed Syed Ab\u016b Bakr.\u00b9 Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n failed to make a sifting enquiry into this\n\n\u00b9 He was Commandant of a Mughal out-post on the Assam frontier at Jamdhara, under Jahangir.

He appointed his nephew, Ahmad Beg Kh\u0101n\u00b2 to be Governor of Orissa, whilst he himself resided at Jah\u0101ngirnagar (Dacca), and devoted himself to the work of administration. As during his incumbency, several grave affairs came to pass, these will be briefly narrated. In the 17th year of the Emperor's accession, corresponding to 1031 A.H., news reached Emperor Jah\u0101ngir to the effect that the King of Persia was aiming to wrest the fort of Qandah\u0101r.\u00b3 In consequence thereof, Zainul-'Abidin, the Pay-Master General of the Ahadi\u2074 troops, communicated an order to Prince Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n at Burh\u0101npur, directing the latter to march quickly to the Imperial presence with troops, artillery and elephants. The Prince marching from Burh\u0101npur\u2075 reached Mando,\u2076 sent a message to the\n\n\u00b9 He was the youngest son of Mirza Gh\u012b\u1e63 Beg, and a brother of Empress N\u016br Jah\u0101n.

He was a son of Muhammad Shar\u012bf, eldest son of Gh\u012b\u1e63 Beg, father of Empress N\u016br Jah\u0101n.\n\u00b3 In the 15th year, when the Persians threatened Qandahar, Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n was appointed by Jah\u0101ngir Governor of Multan. In the 17th year, Sh\u0101h Akbar, king of Persia, took Qandahar, after a siege of forty days. Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n was called to court for consultation, and it was decided that Prince Khurr\u0101m (Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n) should be placed at the head of the expeditionary force to reconquer Qandahar. In the meantime, Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n rebelled, and the expedition to Qandahar was not undertaken. See Bloch. Tr., \u0100in, Vol. I, pp. 503-504.\n\u2074 They were a body of troops intermediate between the Regulars and non-Regulars and Auxiliaries. They were created under Akbar. See Bloch.

He also asked for pargannah Dholpur being added to his jagir, and set Dari\u0101 Kh\u0101n Afgh\u0101n to take charge of it. But before the arrival of the Prince's letter, the Emperor had negotiated the marriage of Prince Shahry\u0101r with a daughter of Nur Mahal by Sher Afghan, and at Nur Mahal's request the aforesaid Pargannah had been bestowed on Shahary\u0101r, and Sharifu-l-Mulk, servant of Prince Shahary\u0101r, had taken possession of the fort of Dholpur. Soon after, Dari\u0101 Kh\u0101n arrived and wanted to forcibly take possession of the fort. From both sides, the fire of conflict kindled. As luck would have it, an arrow hit Sharifu-l-Mulk on the eye, and blinded him. This mishap caused the Begam to be indignant; the fire of discord blazed up, and at the instance of the Begam, the expedition to Qandahar was entrusted to Prince Shahary\u0101r, whilst Mirz\u0101 Rustam Safavi was appointed 'Ataliq of the Prince and Generalissimo of.\n\n1 Dholpur lies 20 kos from Agra, near the left bank of the Chambal river.

Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n or Prince Khurram was Jahang\u012br's third son.

Mirz\u0101 Rustam's daughter was married to Prince Parviz, second son of Jahang\u012br. He invaded Qandahar, but met with no success. In 1021, Jahang\u012br appointed him Governor of Thatha, and afterwards Sh\u0101shhazari and Governor of Allahabad, and in the 21st year, Governor of Behar. He died in 1051 at Agra. His third son Mirz\u0101 Hasan-i-Safavi was Governor of Koch under Jahang\u012br and died in 1059 A.H., and his grandson (son of Mirz\u0101 Hasan) named Mirz\u0101 Safshekan was Faujdar of Jessore in Bengal. (See Bloch. Tr., \u0100in, Vol. I, pp. 314-315 and Maasir-ul-Umara). Mirzanagar, a place close to Jessore town, probably was Mirz\u0101 Safshekan's Faujdari headquarters, and received its name from him. He died in 1073 A.H.

On hearing of the blazing of the fire of discord, Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n sent to the Emperor along with a letter Afzal Kh\u0101n, son of Abul Fazl \u2018Allami, who after his dismissal from the Governorship of Behar, held the office of Diwan to the Prince, so that with the aid of cajolery and civility the storm of the dust of discord might be made to subside, and relations of amity and harmony between the Emperor and the Prince might not cease. Inasmuch as the Begam held absolute sway over the mind of the Emperor, Afzal Kh\u0101n was refused an audience, and was ordered back without accomplishing his mission. And orders were passed on the Imperial Revenue-officers directing that the Mahals in the possession of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, in the Sarkars of Hisar\u00b9 and Doab,\u00b2 should be transferred to Prince Shahary\u0101r. And injunctions were issued to Prince Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, intimating that the \u0160\u016bbahs of the Dakhin, and Gujr\u0101t\u00b3 and Malw\u0101\u2074 were bestowed on him, and that he might rule over them, making his headquarters within those limits wherever he pleased, and directing that he should quickly despatch to the Emperor some troops for the expedition to Qandahar. And in the beginning of the month of Khurd\u0101d, in the 18th year of the Emperor's accession, in the year 1032 A.H. Asaf Kh\u0101n,\u2075 was appointed \u0160ubahd\u0101r of the Provinces of Bengal and Orissa.

This Sarkar is described as containing 27 mahals, with revenue of 52,554,905 Dams. (Jarrett's Tr. of \u0100in, Vol II, p. 298).\n\n\u00b2 Under the \u0160\u016bbah of Lahore (Jarrett's Tr. of \u0100in, Vol II, p. 315), five Doab Sarkars are mentioned.

He received from Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n the title of Yaminu-d-daulah and Khan-i-Kh\u0101n\u0101n Sepahsalar, and was made a commander of 9,000. He died in 1051 A.H. and was buried at Lahore, north of Jahangir's tomb. He married a daughter of Mirza Gh\u0101\u1e63\u1e63-u-din Ali Asaf Kh\u0101n II. See Bloch, Tr., \u0100in, Vol. I, pp. 511 and 368 and Maasir ul-Umara.\nto A\u1e63af Kh\u0101n partiality for Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, induced the Begam to call from Kabul Mah\u0101bet Kh\u0101n, who was an old enemy of A\u1e63af Kh\u0101n, and who was also ill-disposed to Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n. And the Imperial order with the Begam's message was sent for summoning Mah\u0101bet Kh\u0101n. Mah\u0101bet Kh\u0101n on arrival from Kabul, was honoured with an audience by the Emperor. Order was also passed to Sharif Kh\u0101n, Vakil of Prince Parviz, to hasten to Court with the Prince and the Behar army. And since the Begam was anxious, owing to separation from her brother, that year on the 2nd of the month of Adar, order was given to A\u1e63af Kh\u0101n to return to Court. In short, on being apprised of the foregoing incidents of inattention on the part of the Emperor, and of ill-will on the part of N\u016br Jah\u0101n Begam, Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n arranged that Q\u0101zi \u2018Abdul \u2018Aziz proceeding to court, should represent his wishes to the Emperor, whilst he himself would follow before the arrival of Prince Parviz and the armies from different parts of the Empire, so that the dust of discord might possibly be laid. In short, the aforesaid Q\u0101zi met the Imperial army on the banks of the river Ludianah town is situated on its banks. See \u0100in-i-Akbari, Jarrett's Tr., Vol. II, p. 310.\n\nThe Emperor marched back from Sirhind, and all the grandees and officers from different jagirs joined the Emperor, and before the Capital, Delhi, was reached, a numerous force collected. The vanguard of the Imperialists was entrusted to the command of \u2018Abdull\u0101h Kh\u0101n, who was ordered to proceed one kroh in advance of the Imperial camp. But Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, foreseeing the result, thought that if he engaged in fighting against such a numerous army, the result might prove disastrous. Consequently, together\n\n1 See p. 517, Vol. I, Bloch. Tr. of \u0100in and Maasir-ul-Umara.

Sirhind was long the western frontier of India, and hence the name.\n\n4 He was a Barha Syed. The Barha Syeds alone had the privilege to fight in the vanguard (or harawil).\nwith the Kh\u0101n Kh\u0101n\u0101n\u00b9 and other officers, retiring by the right-side road, he marched 20 kroh northwards. He left, however, Rajah Bikramajit\u00b2 and D\u0101r\u0101b Kh\u0101n, son of the Kh\u0101n Kh\u0101n\u0101n, together with other officers, in front of the Imperialists, so that if the latter, under the direction of the Begam, led the pursuit, the aforesaid commanders might prevent their advance, till the discord subsided. On the 20th Jam\u0101d\u012b-al-Awwal 1032 A.H., news of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u2019s withdrawal reached the Emperor. The Begam, under the advice of Mah\u0101bet Kh\u0101n, detached \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n Khw\u0101jah Abul Hasan,\u00b3 \u2018Abdull\u0101h Kh\u0101n, Lashkar Kh\u0101n,\u2074 Fed\u0101i Kh\u0101n\u2075 and Naw\u0101zish Kh\u0101n,\u2076 &c., with 25,000 cavalry to fight. From Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u2019s side, Rajah Bikramajit and D\u0101r\u0101b Kh\u0101n, arraying their forces, advanced, and on both sides the fighting commenced with arrows and muskets. As \u2018Abdull\u0101h Kh\u0101n\u2077 was in intrigue with Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, he promised that when the two forces would encounter each other, availing himself of an opportunity, he would go over to the Prince\u2019s side. Finding an\n\n\u00b9 This was Kh\u0101n-i-Kh\u0101n\u0101n Mirza Abdur Rahim, son of Bairam Kh\u0101n. See Bloch. Tr. of \u0100in, Vol. I, p. 334 and Maasir-ul-Umara. When Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n rebelled, he sided with the latter. His second son\u2019s name was D\u0101r\u0101b Kh\u0101n, who fell into the hands of Prince Parviz and Mah\u0101bet Kh\u0101n, who killed him, wrapped his head in a table-cloth, and sent it as a present of a \u2018melon\u2019 to his father, Mirza Abdur Rahim.\n\n\u00b2 His name was Rai Pati Das; he was a Khatri. Akbar conferred on him the title of Raja Bikramajit. He served Akbar as joint Diwan of Bengal, Diwan of Behar, and was made a commander of 5,000. Jahangir on his accession created him M\u012br Atash or Superintendent of Artillery. When disturbances broke out in Gujrat, he was sent to Ahmadabad to pacify the rebels.

I am not sure if he is meant here.\nopportunity now, he with the greatest expedition joined Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n's army. Rajah Bikramajit who was aware of 'Abdull\u0101h Kh\u0101n's plan, with great delight went to D\u0101r\u0101b Kh\u0101n, to inform the latter of 'Abdull\u0101h Kh\u0101n's desertion. As luck would have it, a cannon-ball hit the Rajah on the forehead, and threw him down. From this mishap, the thread of the arrangement of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n's army was broken. Although a commander like 'Abdull\u0101h Kh\u0101n, destroying the basis of the Imperial vanguard, had joined the Prince's army, D\u0101r\u0101b Kh\u0101n and other commanders of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n's army were not daring enough to hold their ground. On the Imperialists' side, the desertion of 'Abdull\u0101h Kh\u0101n, and on the Prince's side, the fall of Rajah Bikramajit caused mutual confusion, and both the armies were dispirited. Towards the end of the day, both the forces withdrew to their quarters. At length, the Emperor withdrew from Akbar\u0101b\u0101d towards Ajmir, whilst Prince Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n retired towards Mando. On the 25th of the Jam\u0101di-al-Awwal, the Emperor detached Prince Parviz with a large army to follow up Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n; and Mah\u0101bet Kh\u0101n was entrusted with the command of Prince Parviz's army. When Prince Parviz with his army, crossing the defile of Chanda\\(^1\\) arrived in the Vil\u0101yet\\(^2\\) of Mando, Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n with his army sallied out of the fort of Mando, and detached Rustam Kh\u0101n\\(^3\\) with a body of troops to encounter Prince Parviz.

At the time when the two armies fell into battle-array, Rustam Kh\u0101n riding forward joined the Imperialists. This wretched Rustam Kh\u0101n was by Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n elevated from the mansab of a Sehbasti\\(^4\\) to that of a Panjhaz\u0101ri, and honoured with the title of Rustam Kh\u0101n and appointed Governor of Gujrat, and he enjoyed the Prince's full confidence.

See Bloch, Tr., \u0100in, Vol I, p. 478.\n\n4 \"Sehbasti\" in the printed text seems to be a mistake or misprint for \"Sihaspi.\" (See Bloch \u0100in, Tr., Vol I, p 245, for a dissertation on the constitution of the Mughal Army).\nappointing him generalissimo detached him to encounter Prince Parviz, the wretch shelving the obligations of so many years' kindness, joined Mahabet Khan. Owing to the occurrence of this mishap, Shah Jahans army got demoralised, and all confidence between each other was lost. Many, going the high-way of infidelity, fled. On hearing of this, Shah Jahans summoned the remnant of the army to his side, crossed the river Narbada, and removed the boats to his side of the river-bank. Leaving Bairam Beg, the Pay-Master General of the Force, with a body of troops on the banks of the river, Shah Jahans himself with the Khan-i-Khanan and Abdulla Khan and others proceeded towards the fort of Asir and Burhampur. Muhammad Taqi Bakshi intercepting the letter of the Khan Khanan, which the latter had secretly despatched to Mahabet Khan, produced it before Shah Jahans.\n\nOn the top of the letter, this line was written:\n\n\u0645\u06cc\u200c\u062f\u0627\u0646\u0645 \u06a9\u0633 \u0628\u0646\u0638\u0631 \u0646\u06af\u0627\u0647 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u06a9\u0646\u0645\n\u0648\u0631 \u0646\u0647 \u0628\u0647\u200c\u0631\u06cc\u0647 \u0647\u06cc \u0632\u06cc \u0622\u0631\u0627\u0645\u06cc\n\nTranslation:\nA hundred persons with their eyes watch me,\nOr else I should have fled from this discomfort.\n\nShah Jahans summoning the Khan Khanan with his son Darab Khan from his house, secretly showed him the letter. The latter failed to give any satisfactory explanation. Consequently, the Khan-i-Khanan with his son was kept in surveillance close to the Princes quarters, and then the inauspicious presage of the line (quoted above) came to pass. Mahabet Khan sending secret letters, had diverted the Khan Khanan from the path of loyalty, through the persuasions of traitors. And the Khan Khanan, by way of advice, told Shah Jahans that as the times were out of joint, following the saying: \"If the times do not fall in with you, you must adjust yourself to the times\") he should arrange for an armistice, as that would be expedient and desirable in the interests of humanity. Shah Jahans deeming the extinguishing of the fire of discord to be a great achievement, called the Khan Khanan to his closet, and first reassured his mind in respect of him by making the latter swear by the Qor\u00e2n. And the Khan Khanan placing his hand on the Qor\u00e2n swore with vehemence that he would never play false with the\nPrince, nor turn disloyal; and that he would put forth his efforts to bring about the welfare of both the parties. Thus being reassured, Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n sent off the Kh\u0101n Kh\u0101n\u0101n, and kept D\u0101r\u0101b Kh\u0101n and his sons with himself. It was also settled that the Kh\u0101n Kh\u0101n\u0101n should remain on this side of the river Narbada, and by means of correspondence arrange terms of peace. When news of the conclusion of an armistice and of the departure of the Kh\u0101n Kh\u0101n\u0101n became known, the troops who had been stationed to guard the banks of the river, ceasing to be vigilant and alert, neglected to guard the ferries of the river. Of a night, at a time when these were asleep, a body of Imperialists plunging into the river with their horses, gallantly crossed over. A great hubbub arose, and from panic men\u2019s hands and feet were paralysed. Bairam Beg, ashamed of himself, went to Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n. On hearing of the treachery of the Kh\u0101n Kh\u0101n\u0101n and of the crossing of the river Narbada by the Imperialists, Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n deeming it inexpedient to halt any further at Burhanpur, crossed the river Tapti, in the thick of the rains, amidst a storm-wave, and marched towards Orissa, scouring the Province of Q\u016b\u1e6dbu-l-Mulk.\n\n1 The following is extracted from Bloch. Tr., \u0100in, as it briefly and at the same time lucidly describes Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u2019s movements:\n\n\u201cSh\u0101h Jah\u0101n rebelled, returned with Mirza Abdur Rahim Kh\u0101n-i-Kh\u0101n\u0101n to Mando, and then moved to Burhanpur. On the march thither, Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n intercepted a letter which Mirza Abdur Rahim had secretly written to Mah\u0101bet Kh\u0101n, whereupon he imprisoned him and his son D\u0101r\u0101b Kh\u0101n, and sent them to Fort Asir, but released them soon after on parole. Parviz and Mah\u0101bet Kh\u0101n had in the meantime arrived at the Narbadda to capture Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n. Bairam Beg, an officer of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, had for this reason removed all boats to the left side of the river, and successfully prevented the Imperialists from crossing. At Mirza Abdur Rahim\u2019s advice, Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n proposed at this time an armistice. He made him swear on the Qoran, and sent him as ambassador to Prince Parviz. Mah\u0101bet Kh\u0101n, knowing that the fords would not now be so carefully watched as before, effected a crossing, and Mirza Abdur Rahim, forgetful of his oath, joined Parviz and did not return to Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, who now fled from Burhanpur, marching through Talinganah to Orissa and Bengal. Mah\u0101bet and Mirza Abdur Rahim followed him up a short distance beyond the Tapti. . . Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n then moved into Bengal and Behar, of which he made D\u0101r\u0101b Kh\u0101n Governor.\u201d Bloch.

Suddenly hearing of the arrival of the Prince, he lost all courage, and abandoning his mission, he proceeded to Pipli which was the Headquarters of the Governor of that Province, and withdrew thence with his treasures and effects to Katak, which from Pipli is 12 kroh towards Bengal. Not finding himself strong enough to encamp even at Katak, he fled to Bardwan, and informed \u0160\u0101leh Beg, nephew of Ja'fer Beg, of the whole affair. \u0160\u0101leh Beg did not credit the news of the arrival of Shah Jah\u0101n in Orissa. At this time, a letter of a soothing tenour came from \u2018Abdull\u0101h Kh\u0101n to \u0160\u0101leh Beg. The latter, not being won over, fortified the fort of Bardwan, and entrenched himself there. And when Shah Jah\u0101n's army arrived at Bardwan, \u2018Abdull\u0101h besieged the fort, and \u0160\u0101leh Beg was hard-pressed. When things came to their worst, and all hopes of relief were lost, \u0160\u0101leh Beg was obliged to surrender to \u2018Abdull\u0101h Kh\u0101n. The Kh\u0101n putting a piece of cloth round the Beg's neck, dragged him to the presence of the Prince. When this thorn was put out of the way, the banners of victory were raised aloft towards R\u0101jmahal. When this\n\nJarrett's Tr., Ain, Vol. II, p. 230), Quli Qutb Sh\u0101h was the founder of the Qutb Sh\u0101hi dynasty in 1512, with Golconda as his capital. It was conquered by Aurangzeb in 1688.

(See Jarrett's Tr., Vol. II, p. 143).\n\nThe list of grantees in the Padgh\u0101namah describes Muhammad Sh\u0101h (or \u0160\u0101leh Beg) as a son of Mirza Sh\u0101h\u012b, and nephew of Mirza Jafar Beg Asaf Kh\u0101n III. (See Bloch. Tr., Ain, Vol. I, pp. 411-412). Asaf Kh\u0101n Jafar Beg is described as a man of the greatest genius, an able financier, and a capital accountant. His intelligence was such that he could master the contents of a page by a glance; he was a great horticulturist, planting and lopping off branches with own hands in his gardens. He was also a great poet. He was Vakilul-Mulk and a Commander of Five Thousand, under Emperor Jahangir. His son Mirza Zainul-abidin is mentioned in the Ain as a commander of 1,500 with 500 horse.\nnews reached Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Kh\u0101n Fateh Jang, who was Viceroy of the S\u016bbah of Bengal, he sank in the river of bewilderment. Although his auxiliary forces were scattered about in the tract of Magha and in other places, mustering up courage, at Akbarnagar otherwise called Rajmahal, he set himself to strengthen the fortifications, to mobilize his troops, and to arrange his forces and armaments. At this time, the message of the Prince came to him, to the following effect: \"Owing to the decree of fate, whatever was predestined has passed from potentiality into action; and the victorious army has come this side. Though before the outlook of my aspiration, the extent of this Province is not wider than the area covered by the movement of a glance, yet as this tract has fallen in my course, I cannot summarily leave it. If you intend to proceed to the Imperial presence, and to stay my hand from meddling with your life, property and family, I tell you to set out in full security for Delhi; or else if you consider it expedient to tarry in this Province, select any place in this Province that may suit you, and you will be let alone there at ease and comfort.\" Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Kh\u0101n in reply wrote: \"The Emperor has entrusted this country to this, their old servant. So long as my head survives, I will cling to this province; so long as my life lasts, I will hold out. The beauties of my past life are known to me; how little now remains of my future life in this world? Now I have no other aspiration than that, in the discharge of my obligations for past Royal favours and in the pursuit of loyalty, I may sacrifice my life, and obtain the felicity of martyrdom.\" In short, Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Kh\u0101n at first intended to shelter himself in the fort of Akbarnagar, but as the fort was large, and as he had not at his command a sufficiently large force to properly defend it from all sides, he entrenched himself in his son's mausoleum, which had a small rampart. At this time, a body of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n's troops who were detailed to garrison the Fort besieged the rampart of the mausoleum, and from both inside and outside, the fire of arrows and muskets\n\n1 He appears to have gone at this time temporarily from Dacca (then the Mughal Viocegal Capital of Bengal) to Rajmahal.\n2 That is, South-Western Behar.

At the same time, Ahmad Beg Kh\u0101n also arrived, and entered the rampart. By his arrival, the hearts of the besieged were somewhat encouraged. As the family and children of many of Ibr\u0101him Kh\u0101n\u2019s party were on the other side of the river, \u2018Abdull\u0101h Kh\u0101n and Dari\u0101 Kh\u0101n Afgh\u0101n planned to cross the river, and array their forces on the other side. Ibr\u0101him Kh\u0101n\\(^1\\) on hearing of this, became anxious. Taking in his company Ahmad Kh\u0101n, Ibrahim marched confounded to the other side, left other persons to protect the fortifications of the mausoleum, and sent in advance of himself war-vessels, so that these seizing the routes of march of the Prince\u2019s army, might prevent his crossing over.\n\n---\n\n**END OF FASC. 2.**\n\n\\(^1\\) M\u012brz\u0101 Ghi\u015b Beg\u2019s third son was Ibr\u0101him Kh\u0101n Fateh J\u016bng. He was a brother of the Empress Nur Jah\u0101n, and through her influence, became Governor of Bengal and Behar, under Jah\u0101ng\u012br. He was killed near his son\u2019s tomb at Rajmahal, during Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u2019s rebellion. His son had died young, and was buried near Rajmahal, on the banks of the Ganges (Tuzuk, p. 383). His nephew, Ahmad Beg Kh\u0101n, on Ibr\u0101him\u2019s death, retreated to Dacca, where he handed over to Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n 500 elephants, and 45 lacs of rupees (Tuzuk, p. 384). See also Padshahnamah 11,727 and Bloch. Tr., Ain. Vol. I, p. 511. *Iqbalnamah-i-Jahangiri* and *Maasir-ul-Umara.*\nBut before the war-vessels arrived, Daria Kh\u0101n had crossed the river. Ibrahim Kh\u0101n on being apprised of this, directing Ahmad Beg to cross the river, sent him to oppose Daria Kh\u0101n. When the two armies encountered each other, a great battle ensued on the banks of the river, and a large number of Ahmad Beg's comrades were killed. Ahmad Beg, not finding himself strong enough to stand his ground, retired. Ibrahim Kh\u0101n with a corps of well-mounted cavalry, joined him. Daria Kh\u0101n, on hearing of this, retired a few kroh, and Abd\u016bllah Kh\u0101n Bahadur Firuz Jang also advancing a few kroh, under guidance of zamindars, crossed the river, and joined Daria Kh\u0101n. By chance, on a site which is flanked on one side by the river and on the other by a dense jungle, they encamped, and arrayed their troops for battle. Ibrahim Kh\u0101n, crossing the river Ganges, set to fight. He detached Syed N\u016brull\u0101h, an officer, with eight hundred cavalry to form\n\n---\n\n1 Daria Kh\u0101n was a Rohilla general under Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n. In the beginning, he was employed under Shaikh Farid, and under Shar\u012bf-\u0131-Mulk, distinguished himself in the battle of Dh\u014dlp\u016br. After the battle of Benares, he deserted Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n. (See Maasiru-l-Umara, p. 18, Vol. II).\n\n2 When Rajab Partab, Rajah of Bhojpur or Ujjain (west of Arrah) revolted against the Emperor Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, in the 10th year of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n's reign, Abd\u016bllah Kh\u0101n Firuz Jang besieged and captured Bhojpur (1046 A.H.) Partab surrendered, and was executed; his wife became a Muhammedan and was married to Abd\u016bllah's grandson. (See Padshahnamah I, b. pp. 271 to 274 and Maasiru-l-Umara, p. 777, Vol. II). Abd\u016bllah Kh\u0101n, though he was thoroughly loyal to Prince Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n at the battle of Benares, subsequently seceded from the Prince, and submitted to Jahangir through the intercession of Kh\u0101n Jahan. (See p. 248, Faso. 3, Iqbalnamah-i-Jahangiri).\n\n3 One Mir N\u016brull\u0101h is mentioned in the \u0100in amongst the learned men of Akbar's time. It is evident the N\u016brull\u0101h in the text was a Syed of Barha; for the Syeds of Barha from Akbar's time were enrolled in the Army, and claimed their place in battle in the van or haraol. Many of these Barha Syeds for their military or political services to the State, were honoured by the Mughal Emperors with the honorific distinction of \"Kh\u0101n,\" which in course of time very often obliterated all traces of their being Syeds. For instance, Syed Ali Asghar, son of Syed Mahm\u016bd of Barha, received the title of 'Saif Kh\u0101n' under Jahangir, his nephew Syed Jafar received the title of 'Shujait Kh\u0101n', Syed Jafar's nephew, Syed Sul\u1e6d\u0101n, received the title of\nthe van, and set Ahmad Beg Kh\u0101n with seven hundred cavalry to form the centre; whilst he himself with thousands of cavalry and infantry, held the line of reserve. A great battle ensued, when the two forces encountered each other. N\u016brull\u0101h being unable to stand his ground, retreated, and the fighting extended to Ahmad Beg Kh\u0101n. The latter gallantly continuing the fight, was seriously wounded. Ibrahim Kh\u0101n being unable to be a passive spectator of the scene, advanced rapidly. By this forward movement, the array of his force was disturbed. Many of his followers stooped to the disgrace of flight, whilst Ibrahim Kh\u0101n with a few troops only advanced to the battle-field. Although the officers of his staff seizing him, wanted to drag him out from that labyrinth of destruction, he did not assent to retreat, and said: \"At my time of life, this cannot be. What can be better than that, sacrificing my life, I should be reckoned amongst the loyal servants of the Emperor\"? At this juncture, the enemy from all sides rushing up, inflicted on him mortal wounds, finished his work, and victory declared itself for the adherents of the fortunate Prince. And a body of men who were entrenched inside the rampart of the mausoleum, on being apprised of this, were depressed. At this time, the Prince's army set fire to a mine which they had laid under the rampart, whilst gallant and intrepid soldiers rushing up from all sides stormed the fortifications. In this assault, 'Abid Kh\u0101n Diw\u0101n and M\u012br Taqi Bakhshi and some others were killed by arrows and muskets, and the fort was stormed. Many of the garrison of the fort fled bare-headed and bare-footed, whilst a number of people with whom the charge of their family and children was the halter of their\n\n'Salabat Kh\u0101n alias Ikhtiy\u0101s Kh\u0101n,' the latter's cousin, Syed Muzaffar, received the title of 'Himmat Kh\u0101n.' Again Syed Abd\u016bl Wahh\u0101b received the title of 'Diler Kh\u0101n,' whilst Syed Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n-i-Sh\u0101hjah\u0101n's son, Syed Sher Z\u0101m\u0101n, received the title of 'Muzaffar Kh\u0101n,' another son, Syed Munawar, received the title of 'Lashkar Kh\u0101n,' whilst his grandson, Syed Firuz, received the title of 'Ikhtiy\u0101s Kh\u0101n.' Again, Syed Qasim flourished under the title of 'Shah\u0101mat Kh\u0101n' in Aurangzeb's reign, whilst his nephew, Syed Nasrat, held the title of 'Y\u0101r Kh\u0101n' under Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u0101h. (See the Tusuk, Padghah-namah, Maasiru-l-Umara, Alamgirnamah, Maasir-i-Alamgiri, and also Professor Blochmann's interesting note on Barha Syeds on his Tr., of \u0100in Akbari, Vol. I, pp. 390-392). The Maasiru-l-Umara mentions also one M\u012br N\u016brull\u0101h, as a son of M\u012br Khallilull\u0101h (p. 337, Vol. III, Maasir).\nneck, came and submitted to the Prince. As Ibrahim Khan's family and children, effects and treasures were at Jahangirnagar (Dacca), Shah Jahans army proceeded there by river.\n\n1 For a graphic contemporary account of this warfare, see Iqbalnamah-i-Jahangiri (Pers. text, Fasc. 3, pp. 218-221), and the Tuzuk (p. 383). Ibrahim Khan was killed near the tomb of his son at Rajmahal, on the banks of the Ganges. Our author appears to have borrowed his account (in an abridged form) from the Iqbalnamah, though there are slight variations. In the text we are told that Ibrahim Khan at the battle had with him \"thousands of cavalry and infantry,\" whilst in the \"Iqbalnamah,\" it is mentioned that Ibrahim Khan had with him only \"one thousand cavalry.\"\n\n2 Ibrahim Khan Fatih Jang was a son of 'Itamd-n-daulah Mirza Ghias. His real name was Mirza Ibrahim.\n\nIn the commencement of his career, he held the office of Bakhshi and Wagia-navis at Ahmadabad in Gujrat. In the 9th year of Jahangir's reign, he received the title of \"Kh\u00e2n\" and the mansab of hazar and panjahi, and was promoted to the office of Imperial Bakhshi, and was gradually further advanced to the rank of Panjhaizari and to the office of Subadar (or Viceroy) of Bengal and Orissa, receiving at the same time the titles of \"Ibrahim Khan Fatih Jang.\" In the 19th year of Jahangir's reign, Prince Shah Jahans invaded Orissa and Bengal via Telengana. On hearing of this news, Ibrahim Khan moved from Dacca (which was then the Viceregal Capital, and where his family and treasures were) to Akbarnagar or Rajmahal. Prince Shah Jahans sent messengers to him, to win him over to his side, but he proved unflinching in his loyalty to the Emperor, and fell fighting heroically in the battle of Rajmahal, near the mausoleum of his son. Ibrahim Khan's reply to Prince Shah Jahans, is a model of dignified and firm protest couched in the best diplomatic form of the Persian language, and is worth quoting:\n\n(See Maasir-ul-Umara, Vol. I, p. 185).\n\nAt this time, the Musalmam Viceregal Capital of Bengal continued (See Maasir, p. 185, Vol. I), to be at Dacca or Jahangirnagar, which appears to have been so named during the Viceroalty of Islam Khan I, owing to the decisive battle which was fought under its walls on 9th Muharram 1021 A.H., or 2nd March, 1612 A.C., in the seventh year of Emperor\nKh\u0101n', nephew of Ibrahim Kh\u0101n, who had gone ahead to that city, saw no resource except in surrender, and through the Jahangir's accession, between the Afghans under Khwajah Osman Lohani, and the Mughal Imperialists under Shujait Kh\u0101n Rustam-i-Zam\u0101n (Shaikh Kabir-i-Chisht\u012b),\u2014a battle which finally crushed Afghan resistance in Bengal and Orissa, and firmly consolidated Mughal supremacy throughout these Provinces. (See pp. 60-64, Fasc. 1, Pers. printed text of Iqbalnamah-i-Jahangiri, a contemporary record, and also Tusuk for fascinating descriptions of this sanguinary and decisive battle near Dacca). Stewart wrongly places the battle \"on the banks of the Subarnarika in Orissa.\" Osman being stout, rode at the battle on a rogue elephant called Bakta. Many Imperialist leaders, such as Syed Adam Barha, Shaikh Agha, Iftikhar Khan, Kishwar Kh\u0101n fell at the battle, which was half decided in favour of Osman, when a chance arrow-shot wounded Osman on the forehead, and, coupled with the arrival of Mughal reinforcement under Mu'taqid Kh\u0101n and Abdus Sal\u0101m Kh\u0101n, saved the Mughal disaster, and turned it into a victory.\n\nIt would appear that when in the 19th year of Jahangir's reign corresponding to 1093 A.H. Prince Shah Jah\u0101n rebelling against his father, invaded Bengal, the Mughal Bengal Viceroy, Ibrahim Kh\u0101n Fateh Jang (a relation of Empress Nur Jah\u0101n) had moved from his capital at Dacca or Jahangirnagar to Rajmahal or Akbarnagar. The Iqbalnamah-i-Jahangir (p. 218, Fasc. 3, printed text), a contemporary record, states that Ibrahim's troops were scattered at the time on the borders of Magha, which signifies South Western Behar. Owing to paucity of troops (the Maasir explains otherwise), Ibrahim did not think of fortifying the fort of Rajmahal which was large, but entrenched himself in the mausoleum of his son, situate within the Fort and close to the river Ganges. Shah Jah\u0101n moved from Burhanpur in the Dakhin across Talingana into Orissa, overran it across Pipli and Katak, and moved to Bardwan across Sarkar Madaran, and after capturing Bardwan (where Salih was commandant) marched up to Rajmahal, where the great battle was fought, and after defeating Ibrahim Kh\u0101n, proceeded to Dacca, whither Ahmad Beg Kh\u0101n (nephew of Ibrahim and of Empress Nur Jah\u0101n) had previously retreated after Ibrahim's death. Ahmad Beg surrendered to Shah Jah\u0101n at Dacca (according to the Tusuk and Maasir) with forty-five lacs of treasure and 500 elephants. Shah Jah\u0101n leaving Darab Kh\u0101n (a son of Mirza Abdur Rahim Kh\u0101n Khan\u0101n) as Governor of Bengal, marched back westward across Bengal, Behar and Jaunpur to Benares, where he was opposed and checked by Mahabet Kh\u0101n. (See Iqbalnamah-i-Jahangiri, Fasc. 3, Pers. text, pp. 215, 216, 217, 222, 223, 228, 238, 239). Shah Nawaz Kh\u0101n was the eldest son of Abdur Rahim Kh\u0101n-i-Kh\u016bz\u0101n; his life also is given in the Maasir-ul-Umara.\n\n1 Ahmad Beg Kh\u0101n was a son of Muhammad Sharif, and a nephew of Ibrahim Kh\u0101n Fateh Jang, the Bengal Viceroy, and of Empress Nur Jah\u0101n. At the time of Prince Shah Jah\u0101n's incursion into Orissa and Bengal, he was Deputy Governor of Orissa. He was at the time engaged in an expedition against Khurda. On hearing of Shah Jah\u0101n's invasion, he withdrew to Pipli.\nintercession of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u2019s confidants, was granted an audience with the Prince. The Prince\u2019s officers were ordered to confiscate Ibrahim Kh\u0101n\u2019s treasures. Besides goods and silk-stuffs, elephants and aloes wood, ambergris and other rarities, forty lacs of rupees were confiscated. The Prince released from confinement Darab Kh\u0101n, son of the Kh\u0101n-i-Khan\u0101n, who had hitherto been in prison, and exacting from him an oath, entrusted to him the Government of Bengal, and took along with him as hostages the latter\u2019s wife and a son, Sh\u0101h Naw\u0101z Kh\u0101n.\u00b9 The Prince sent Rajah Bhim,\u00b2 son of Rajah Karan, with a large force, as his Deputy to Patna, and he followed himself with \u2018Abdullah (his head-quarters), thence to Katak, and not feeling himself secure even there, marched first to Bardwan, whence he went to Rajmahal or Akbarnagar, and joined his uncle Ibrahim Kh\u0101n. Being defeated in the battle there, Ahmad Beg moved to Dacca (which was then the Viceregal capital of Bengal, and where the family and treasures of Ibrahim Kh\u0101n were), but was soon overtaken there by Prince Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, to whom he surrendered. On Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u2019s accession, he was appointed Faujdar of Siwastan. (See Maasir-ul-Umara, p. 194, Vol. I).\n\n\u00b9 In the text there is some mistake. When Dar\u0101b Kh\u0101n (second son of Mirza Abdur Rahim Kh\u0101n-i-Khan\u0101n) was made Governor of Bengal, Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n took his wife, a son and a daughter, and also a son of Sh\u0101h Naw\u0101z Kh\u0101n (eldest son of the Kh\u0101n-i-Khan\u0101n) as hostages (see Maasir-ul-Umara). Sh\u0101h Naw\u0101z was not taken as a hostage, as the text would imply. Dar\u0101b was subsequently killed by Mahabet Kh\u0101n, at the instance of Jahangir. The following chronogram is given in the Maasir-ul-Umara (p. 17, Vol. II), as yielding the date of Dar\u0101b\u2019s death (1084 A.H.):\n\n\u0634\u06cc\u0647 \u067e\u0627\u06a9 \u0634\u062f \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0627\u0628 \u0633\u06a9\u06cc\n\n\u00b2 R\u0101m D\u0101s, the Kachwah Rajput, was at first attached as naib in the Financial Department under Todar Mal, and soon gained Akbar\u2019s favour by his regularity and industry. Emperor Jahangir conferred on him the title of \u2018Rajah Karan,\u2019 but owing to his disgraceful flight during the wars in the Dakhin, he lost Jahangir\u2019s favour. Jahangir is stated to have cursed him thus:\u2014\u201cWhen thou wert in Rai Sal\u2019s service, thou hadst a tanakah per diem; but my father took an interest in thee, and made thee an Amir. Do not Rajputs think flight a disgraceful thing? Alas, thy title, Rajah Karan, ought to have taught thee better.

But one Bhim Singh is mentioned (see Bloch Tr., Ain, Vol. I, p. 418), amongst the grandsons of Madhu Singh, son of Rajah Bhagwan D\u0101s. This Bhim Singh was killed in the Dakhin, in the 3rd year of Sh\u0101h Jahan\u2019s reign. Another Rana Karan is mentioned in the Maasir-ul-Umara (p. 201, Vol. II).\nKh\u0101n and other officers. As the S\u016bbah of Patna was assigned as a jagir to Prince Parviz, the latter had appointed his Diwan, Mukhalis Kh\u0101n\\(^1\\), as its Governor, and Al\u0101h Y\u0101r Kh\u0101n, son of Iftikhar Kh\u0101n, and Sher Kh\u0101n Afgh\u0101n, as its Faujd\u0101rs. On the arrival of Rajah Bhim, they lost courage, and had not even the boldness to shelter themselves in the fort of Patna, till the arrival of auxiliaries. They fled from Patna to Allahabad. Rajah Bhim without movement of the sword or the spear, entered the city, and subdued the S\u016bbah of Behar. Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n followed, and the Jagird\u0101rs of that tract went to meet him. Syed Mubarak, who was Commandant of the fort of Roht\u0101s, leaving the fort in charge of a zamindar, hastened to pay his respects to the prince. The Prince sent Abdullah Kh\u0101n with a body of troops towards the S\u016bbah of Allahabad, and sent Daria Kh\u0101n with another body of troops towards the S\u016bbah of Oudh, whilst after a while, leaving Bair\u0101m Beg to rule over the S\u016bbah of Behar, the Prince himself advanced towards those parts.

He was subsequently promoted to the office of S\u016bbadar of Patna (which was then in the tiyul or jagir of Prince Parviz). In the 19th year of Jah\u0101ng\u012br's reign, when Prince Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n invaded Bengal and Behar via Telingana and Orissa, and advanced towards Patna, after the fall of Ibrahim Kh\u0101n Fatih Jang (the Bengal Viceroy), accompanied by Rajah Bhim, son of Rana Amar Singh (in the text Rana Karan), Mukhalis Kh\u0101n (though he had with him Allahyar Kh\u0101n, son of Iftikhar Kh\u0101n, and Sher Kh\u0101n Afgh\u0101n), instead of holding out in the fort of Patna, fled to Allahabad. After Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n's accession, Mukhalis Kh\u0101n was appointed Faujdar of Gorakpur, and in the seventh year of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n's reign, was appointed a commander of Three Thousand and also S\u016bbadar of Telingana. He died in the 10th year of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n's reign. (See p. 428, Vol. III, Muasir-ul-Umara).\n\n\\(^2\\) His real name was Mirza Shamsi, and he was the eldest son of Kh\u0101n \u2019Azam Mirza \u2019Az\u012bz Kokah. At the end of Akbar's reign, Shamsi was a Commander of Two Thousand, and in the third year of Jah\u0101ng\u012br's reign, he received the title of \"Jah\u0101ng\u012br Quli Kh\u0101n,\" vacant by the death of Jah\u0101ng\u012br Quli Kh\u0101n L\u0101lah Beg, Governor of Behar, and was sent to Gujrat as deputy of his father, who was Governor of Gujrat. Subsequently, Shamsi was made Governor of Jaunp\u016br. When Prince Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n invaded Behar from Bengal, and the Prince's vanguard under Abdullah Kh\u0101n Firuz Jang and Rajah Bhim crossed\npanic-stricken, had left his post, and had fled to Mirz\u0101 Rust\u0101m\\(^1\\) to Allahabad. Abdullah quickly advanced to the town of Jhosi, which is on the other side of the Ganges facing Allahabad, and encamped there. As he had taken a flotilla of large vessels with him from Bengal, with the help of cannonade crossing the river, he encamped at the pleasantly-situate city of Allahabad, whilst the main body of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u2019s army pushed up to Jaunp\u016br.\n\n---\n\n**PRINCE SHAH JAHAN\u2019S FIGHTINGS WITH THE IMPERIAL ARMY, AND HIS WITHDRAWAL TO THE DAKHIN.**\n\nWhen news of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u2019s advance towards Bengal and Orissa reached the Emperor, he sent orders to Prince Parviz and Mahabet Kh\u0101n, who were in the Dakhin, to march quickly towards the Subahs of Allahabad and Beh\u0101r, so that in case the N\u0101zim of Bengal was unable to oppose successfully the advance of Sh\u0101h Jahan\u2019s army, they were to engage Sh\u0101h Jahan. In the meantime, news of the fall of Nawab Ibrahim Kh\u0101n Fateh Jang,\n\nat Chausa to proceed to Allahabad, Jahangir Quli Kh\u0101n fled from Jaunp\u016br to Allahabad and joined Mirza Rustam Safavi there. He subsequently became Governor of Allahabad, and on Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u2019s accession, was appointed Governor of S\u016brat and J\u016bnagarh. He died in 1041 A.H. at S\u016brat. (See Maasir-ul-Umara, p. 524, Vol. I, Pers. text).\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Mirza Rustam Safavi was a son of Sultan Husain Mirza, grandson of Sh\u0101h Ism\u0101il, king of Persia. Mirza Rustam was appointed by Akbar, Governor of Multan; Akbar also made him a Panjhezari, and gave him Multan as Jagir. One of his daughters was married to Prince Parviz, and another to Sh\u0101h Shuja\u2019. He enjoyed great influence with Jahangir who made him a Shashbazari, and also Governor of Allahabad, which he successfully held against Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u2019s General, Abdull\u0101h Kh\u0101n, forcing the latter to retire to Jhosi. He was subsequently Governor of Behar. Shah Jah\u0101n pensioned him off, and he died at Agra in 1051. It is worthy of interest to note that his grandson, Mirza Safshikan (son of Mirza Hasan Safavi) was Faujdar of Jessore in Bengal, where he died in 1073 (see Bloch. Tr., Ain, p. 314, Vol. I). After him, I guess Mirzanagar (a seat of old Jessore Musalman Faujdars) is named. The family still survives there, though impoverished. Safshikan\u2019s son, Mirza Saifuddin. Safavi, accepted the title of \u201cKh\u0101n\u201d under Emperor Aurangzeb. (See Maasir-ul-Umara, Pers. text, p. 478, Vol. III). The Maasir (printed text) states that on the death of his father, Mirza Hasan Safavi, Mirza Safshikan was appointed Faujdar of \u2018Hasr\u2019 in Bengal. \u2018Hasr\u2019 is evidently a misprint or a misreading for \u2018Jasar\u2019 (Jessore).\nN\u0101zim of Bengal, reached the Emperor, who thereon repeated his previous orders to Prince Parviz\u00b9 and Mahabet Kh\u0101n. Prince Parviz with Mahabet Kh\u0101n and other officers marched towards Bengal and Behar. As the Commander of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u2019s army, drawing the boats towards his side, had fortified the ferries of the river Ganges, some delay was caused in the arrival of the Imperialists. The Imperialists, with considerable difficulty, collected thirty flotillas of boats from the zamindars, and under the latter\u2019s guidance selecting one ford, succeeded in crossing over. For some days, both the armies arrayed themselves in front of each other. As the Imperialists numbered 40,000, whilst Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u2019s army did not number more than 10,000, the advisers of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n dissuaded the Prince from offering battle. But Rajah Bhim, son of Rana Karan, unlike other advisers, displayed rashness, and with the rashness common to Rajputs insisted that he would part company, unless they agreed to fight. Prince Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, of necessity, considered it expedient to humour Bhim\u2019s wishes, despite paucity of troops, and passed orders for fighting. Both sides rallying into ranks, commenced to fight.\u00b2\n\nOn both sides, the troops rallied into ranks,\nHolding in hand daggers, arrows and spears.\n\n\u00b9 Prince Parviz was the second son of Emperor Jahangir, and a great favourite with the latter. He imitated his father in everything, \u201cin dress, in quaffing wine, in eating, and in night-keeping\u201d (Iqbalnamah-i-Jahangiri, Fasc. 3, p. 279), and \u201cnever disobeyed his Imperial father\u2019s wishes.\u201d He died at the age of 38 years in the Dakhin, where he was employed in subjugating the country and in quelling the insurrection of Malik Amber, in 1035 A.H., that is, in the twenty-first year of Emperor Jahangir\u2019s accession to the throne. He rendered also important services to his father, in opposing Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u2019s invasion of Bengal, Behar, and Orissa, and with the help of his generalissimo, Mahabet Kh\u0101n, defeated Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n at Benares, and obliged the latter to abandon Behar, Bengal and Orissa, and to beat a hasty retreat to the Dakhin. (See pp. 238, 239, 240, 273, 279, Iqbalnamah-i-Jahangiri, Fasc. 3, Pers. text, which is a contemporary record).\n\n\u00b2 See description of this battle at Benares between the Imperialists under Prince Parviz and Mahabet Kh\u0101n, and Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u2019s troops, in the Iqbalnamah-i-Jahangiri, a contemporary record, p. 233, Pers. text. Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n was totally defeated, owing to the rashness of his favourite officer, Rajah Bhim, who himself fell fighting, being cut to pieces by the Imperialists. The Maasir-ul-Umara states that the battle took place on the side of \u0646\u0647\u0631 \u062a\u0648\u0646\u0633 (Nahr-i-Tunus) in the Suburbs of Benares.\nThey tramped up to the field for fighting;\nYea the fire of war blazed up.\nFirst from both sides, the artillery of the gunners,\nCommenced scattering fire on the hosts.\nFrom the smoke of the gun-waggons of the two forces,\nYou might say a pitchy cloud had formed.\nThe cannon-balls showered like hail,\nYea a storm of destruction blew:\nYea the heads and hands, the breasts and feet of the Com-\nBlew like wind on all sides. [manders,\nFrom blood, yea on every side a stream flowed,\nYea like fish, the bodies of the heroes throbbed.\nOn every side showered stone-rending arrows;\nThey passed right through every body that they lodged in.\nFrom swords and spears, breasts were torn to shreds;\nThe corpses of heroes fell on the ground.\nBut the Imperialists, like stars,\nHemmed in on the army of the Prince.\nThey surrounded the latter in that battle,\nYea as the ring encircles the finger.\nFrom Sh\u00e2h Jah\u00e2n's army, Rajah Bh\u00eem the valorous,\nWas not cowed down by this slaughter.\nSome of his race who were his comrades,\nHurled themselves on the enemy's force.\nThey spurred their horses, yea like lions in fight,\nThey drew swords, yea like water-dragons.\nBy one gallant charge, they broke the enemy's ranks,\nAnd swiftly attacked the enemy's centre.\nWhoever stood in the way of that force,\nThey hurled down his head on the dust.\nBut the veteran Imperialists,\nWhen they saw that suddenly a calamity had come,\nSpurred on their chargers from every side,\nAnd attacked that elephant-like hero, Bh\u00eem.\nThey cut up his body with the sword,\nAnd hurled him down from his steed on the dust.\nOther commanders and officers (of Sh\u00e2h Jah\u00e2n),\nCould not advance to his (Bh\u00eem's) rescue.\n\nThe gunners, on seeing this crisis, leaving the artillery,\nfled, and the arsenal was captured by the Imperialists. Daria Kh\u0101n and other Afgh\u0101ns and Generals ceasing to fight, decamped. The Imperialists, collecting from all sides like a circle formed by a pair of compasses, surrounded the Prince, who remained at the centre. Save and except the elephants carrying flags and standards, and select targeteers who were behind the Prince, and \u2018Abdull\u0101h Kh\u0101n who stood to his right-hand side at a short distance, not a single soul remained. At this moment, an arrow hit the horse of the Prince. When \u2018Abdullah Kh\u0101n saw that the Prince would not retire from the field, he moved up, and by use of great entreaties and exhortations, succeeded in bringing out the Prince from the field, and placing before him his own horse, induced the Prince to mount it. In short, from the battle-field up to Rohtas, the contest did not cease. As at this time, Prince Murad Bakhsh\\(^1\\) was born, and long marches could not be made, leaving him to the protection of God and appointing Khedmit Paraest Kh\u0101n and some other trusty servants to take care of him, Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n with other Princes and adherents slowly marched towards Patna and Behar. At the same time, letters were received from people in the Dakhin, especially from Malik \u2018Ambar\\(^2\\) the Abyssinian.\n\n\\(^1\\) He was the fourth and youngest son of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, whose other sons were (1) Dara Shekh\u014dh, (2) Sh\u0101h Shuja (3) Aurangzeb.\u2014See p. 806, Iqbal-namah-i-Jahangiri, Fasc. 3, Pers. text.\n\n\\(^2\\) He gave no end of trouble to Jahangir. His insurrection is fully described in the Iqbalnamah-i-Jahangiri, a contemporary record, Fasc. 3, pp. 234 to 238. The author of the Iqbalnamah-i-Jahangiri pays a high tribute to his military genius and generalship, to his administrative capacity and vigorous rule in the Dakhin. (See p. 271, Fasc 3, Iqbalnamah-i-Jahangiri, Pers. text). He died at the ripe old age of eighty, holding his own against the Imperialists to the last. After Malik Ambar the Abyssinian\u2019s death, his generalissimo, Yaq\u016bt Kh\u0101n the Abyssinian, together with Malik Amber\u2019s son, Fatih Kh\u0101n, and other officers of Nizam-ul-Mulk, submitted to Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n, Jahangir\u2019s Viceroy or Subadar in the Dakhin, in the twenty-first year of Jahangir\u2019s accession. (See p. 280, Fasc. 3, Pers. text, Iqbalnamah-i-Jahangiri).\n\nThe Maasir-ul-Umara (Vol. III, p. 7), gives some additional facts about him. It states that Malik Amber was an Abyssinian slave of the Bijap\u016br king, Nizam Sh\u0101h. When in 1009 A.H., Queen Chand Sult\u0101n or Chand Bibi was killed, and the fort of Ahmadnagar fell into the hands of Akbar\u2019s officers, and Bahadur Nizam Sh\u0101h was taken prisoner, and kept in the Gwalior fort, Malik Amber and Raju Mian proclaimed their independence. Malik Amber brought to his control the territory extending from the limits of Telengana to a point, four kroh from Ahmadnagar and eight kroh from Daulat\u0101b\u0101d. In\nrequesting the Prince's return towards the Dakhin. Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, after retreat, summoned D\u0101r\u0101b Kh\u0101n who, after taking oaths, had been left as Governor of Bengal, in order to join the Prince in his march. D\u0101r\u0101b Kh\u0101n, owing to his disloyalty and knavery putting a wrong interpretation on his call, replied that the zamindars, surrounding him on all sides, had cut off ways of his march, and that, therefore, his egress being difficult, he begged to be excused. Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n losing all hopes of D\u0101r\u0101b's arrival, and having no body of troops capable of action, was obliged with a sorrowful heart, and in an anxious mood, after leaving D\u0101r\u0101b Kh\u0101n's son in charge of Abdull\u0101h Kh\u0101n, to march towards Akbar-nagar (Rajmahal). From thence carrying all household paraphernalia, which had been left there, Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n marched back towards\n\n1010 A.H., close to Nandirah, a battle was fought between Malik Amber and Mirza Iraj, son of Abdur Rahim Khan-i-Khan\u0101n. Malik Amber was wounded, but the Khan-i-Khan\u0101n, knowing the adversary's capacity, was glad to arrange terms of peace. When Akbar died, and dissensions broke out between Emperor Jahangir and his son, Prince Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, Malik Amber mobilising a large force encroached on Imperial territories. In consequence, during Emperor Jahangir's reign, the Imperialists were constantly engaged in warfare against Malik Amber, who held out to the last, and died a natural death in 1035 A.H. He lies buried in a mausoleum at Danlat\u0101b\u0101d, between the Shrines of Sh\u0101h Muntajab-ud-din Zarbahkh and Sh\u0101h Rajavi Qatt\u0101l. The author of the Maasir-ul-Umara pays a high tribute to Malik Amber, as a general and as a soldier, and also as a leader of men and as an administrator. He ruled his dominions vigorously, stamping out all turbulence, weeding out all bad characters, maintained perfect peace in his domains, and always strove for the well-being and happiness of the subjects he ruled. In the village of Kharki (which was subsequently named Aurang\u0101bad), he digged tanks, laid out public gardens, and built lofty palaces. He was liberal in charities, and very just, and very pious. A poet has written about him.\n\n1 From the battle-field of Benares, after defeat, Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n retreated to Rohtas (up to which desultory fighting was kept up between the Imperialists and Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n's troops), thence marched to Patna and Behar town, and thence to Garhi or Teliagarhi fort. Whilst at Garhi, Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n summoned his Governor of Bengal, D\u0101r\u0101b Kh\u0101n, to join him, but the latter made excuses, whereon Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n becoming dispirited went to Rajmahal, and retreated thence to the Dakhin (being hotly pursued by Prince Parviz and Mah\u0101bet Kh\u0101n) across Sarkar Madaran, Midhipur, Orissa and Telengana. (See Iqbalnamah-i-Jahangiri, Fasc. 8, pp. 239-240).\nthe Dakhin by the same route that he had come. Abdull\u0101h Kh\u0101n, on knowing the disloyalty and villainy of D\u0101r\u0101b Kh\u0101n, slew the latter's grown-up son, and satisfied his grudge. Although Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n sent orders to prevent the son being killed, these had no effect. When the news of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n's retreat from Bengal to the Dakhin reached the Emperor, the latter ordered that Mukhalas Kh\u0101n should quickly go to Prince Parviz, who had gone to Bengal in pursuit of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, and taking up the office of Sazawal (Superintendent of Revenue), should send the Prince with other leading noblemen to the Dakhin. Consequently, Prince Parviz left for the Dakhin, entrusting the S\u016bbah of Bengal to the Jag\u012br of Mah\u0101bet Kh\u0101n and his son Kh\u0101n\u0101hz\u0101d Kh\u0101n.\n\n---\n\nTHE ASSIGNMENT OF BENGAL IN JAG\u012aR TO MAH\u0100BET KH\u0100N AND HIS SON.\n\nWhen the S\u016bbah of Bengal was assigned, in the shape of Jag\u012br, to Nawab Mah\u0101bet Kh\u0101n and his son Kh\u0101n\u0101hz\u0101d Kh\u0101n,\n\n1 Mah\u0101bet Kh\u0101n distinguished himself under Emperor Jah\u0101ng\u012br in the long war carried on in the Dakhin. He was early attached by the Emperor to Prince Parviz, as at\u0101liq and generalissimo, when the Prince was sent to the Dakhin to quell the insurrection there. Where Prince Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n subsequently rebelled against his father (Emperor Jah\u0101ng\u012br), and marching out from the Dakhin across Talingana invaded Orissa and over-ran Bengal and Behar, the Emperor ordered Mah\u0101bet Kh\u0101n along with Prince Parviz to oppose Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n's progress. In this, Mah\u0101bet Kh\u0101n (along with Prince Parviz) completely succeeded, inflicted a crushing defeat on Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n on the battlefield of Benares, and compelled the latter to beat a hasty retreat across Behar, Bengal and Orissa into the Dakhin. For this signal military service, Mah\u0101bet Khan received from Prince Parviz (no doubt, with the previous sanction of the Emperor) Bengal in jag\u012br. His head was soon turned, and he failed to send to the Emperor the war-elephants taken by him in Bengal, and also failed to remit the Imperial revenue from Bengal. For this, the Emperor summoned him to his presence for chastisement, when Mah\u0101bet Kh\u0101n adopted the extraordinary and impudent step of getting at the person of the Emperor, and placing the latter for some time under surveillance\u2014from which at length the Emperor was rescued by the bold stratagem of his Queen, Nur Jah\u0101n Begam. Mah\u0101bet was then sent away in disgrace to Thata, whence he went to Gujrat, and joined the rebel Prince, Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n.

D\u0101r\u0101b Kh\u0101n, without any impediment, came to M\u0101habet Kh\u0101n. But when the news of D\u0101r\u0101b\u2019s coming to M\u0101habet Kh\u0101n reached the Emperor, the latter sent an order to M\u0101habet Kh\u0101n to the following effect: \u201cWhat expediency dost thou see in sparing that villain? It behoves you, instantly on reading this, to send the head of that mischievous rebel to the Imperial presence.\u201d M\u0101habet Kh\u0101n, carrying out the Emperor\u2019s order, beheaded D\u0101r\u0101b Kh\u0101n, and sent the latter\u2019s head to the Emperor. And as M\u0101habet Kh\u0101n had not sent to the Emperor the elephants that he had captured in Bengal, and had defaulted in payment of a large amount of the Imperial Revenue, the Emperor passed orders to the effect that \u2018Arab Dast Ghaib should go to M\u0101habet Kh\u0101n, confiscate the elephants and send them to the Emperor, and tell M\u0101habet Kh\u0101n, that if he got proper accounts, he should submit them personally to the Emperor, and pay up all Revenue arrears to the Imperial exchequer. M\u0101habet Kh\u0101n first sent the elephants to the Emperor, and subsequently after appointing his son Kh\u0101nahz\u0101d Kh\u0101n to be \u0160ubadar of Bengal, set out to meet the Emperor with four or five thousand\n\nFrom the Maasir-ul-Umara (p. 385, Vol. III), the following additional facts about Mahabet Kh\u0101n are gleaned. His real name was Zamanah Beg, his father\u2019s name being Gh\u012bwar Beg Kabuli. He was a Razavi Sayyid. Gh\u012bwar Beg came from Shiraz to Kabul, and thence to India, and entered Akbar\u2019s service, and distinguished himself in the battle of Chitor. Zamanah Beg, in youth, entered Prince Salim\u2019s service as an ahadi, and soon was advanced to the office of Bakhshi under the Prince. In the beginning of Jahangir\u2019s reign, Zamanah Beg was appointed to be commander of three thousand, and received the title of Mahabet Kh\u0101n. He was deputed to serve with Prince Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n in the Dakhin, and in the 12th year of Jahangir\u2019s reign, was appointed \u0160ubadar of Kabul. In the 17th year, dissensions broke out between Emperor Jahangir and Prince Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, and Mahabet Kh\u0101n was recalled from Kabul. When Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n ascended the throne, he advanced Mahabet Kh\u0101n to the rank of Haft hazari, and conferred on him the title of \u201cKh\u0101n-i-Kh\u0101n\u0101n Sip\u0101s\u0101l\u0101r,\u201d and appointed him \u0160ubadar of Ajmir, and next, \u0160ubadar of the Dakhin. He died in 1044 A.H.\n\n1 He appears to have been employed by Emperor Jahangir on similar missions with reference to other refractory princes and officers, such as Hoshang, son of Prince Danyal, and Abdur Rahim Kh\u0101n-i-Kh\u0101n\u0101n and M\u0101habet Kh\u0101n.

When news of his arrival reached the Emperor, order was passed that he would not be granted an audience, so long as he did not pay up the Revenue arrears to the Imperial Exchequer, and so long as he did not redress by exercise of justice the public grievances against him. Afterwards summoning to his presence Barkhurdar, son of Khwaja Nakshbandi, to whom Mahabat Khan, without the Emperor's approval, had betrothed his daughter, the Emperor had him disgracefully whipped and thrown into prison, with his neck bound and head bare. In the morning, Mahabat Khan rode out with his cavalry, and without making obeisance to the Emperor, in an insolent and daring manner broke open the door of the Emperor's Private Chamber, entered it with four hundred or five hundred Rajputs, saluted the Emperor in hunting and travelling suit, and marched back towards his own residence.\n\n1 In p. 253, Fasc. 3, Iqbalnamah-i-Jahangiri, \"Khwajah 'Umar Nakshbandi.\"\n\n2 In the printed text, the words occur \"\u062d\u06a9\u0645 \u0634\u0627\u0647\u0646\u0634\u0627\u0647\u06cc\" which is obviously a mistake. The words should be \"\u062d\u06a9\u0645 \u0634\u0627\u0647\u0646\u0634\u0627\u0647\u06cc\". (See p. 253, Fasc. 3, Iqbalnamah-i-Jahangiri).\n\n3 In the printed Persian text, there is a mistake: the word \"\u063a\u0633\u0644\u062e\u0627\u0646\u0647\" (see p. 256, Fasc. 3, Iqbalnamah) is misprinted in the Riyas as \"\u063a\u0644\u0628 \u0628\u0627\u0632\u06cc.\"\n\nThe Ghusalkhana or 'Bathing Room' was a luxury in Mughal days: it was fitted up elegantly with cooling apparatus and on sultry days, the Mughal Emperors and the Mughal Omara passed much time in it, transacting business. Thus, 'Ghusalkhana' gradually came to signify a 'Private Chamber, or a 'khaakhana.'\n\n4 The author of the Riyas has borrowed the account from the Iqbalnamah-i-Jahangiri (see pp. 256-257, Fasc. 3), but in his attempt to condense it, he has rendered his account slip-shod and confused. The author of the Iqbalnamah-i-Jahangiri, named Mu'tamid Khan, was Jahangir's Bakhshi at the time, and was an eye-witness of what occurred. From the account that he gives, it appears that the Emperor was returning at the time to Hindustan from Kabul, that he had his camp pitched on the banks of the river Bihat (or Jhelam), that he was alone there with some courtiers, such as 'Arab Dast Ghaib, Mir Mansur Badakhshi, Jawaher Khan the Eunuch, Firuz Khan, Khidmat Khan the Eunuch, Baland Khan, Khedmat Parst Khan, Fasih Khan, and three or four others, that all the rest of the Imperial officers and attendants including Asif Khan the Prime Minister, had left and crossed over to the eastern banks of the river. Seizing, therefore, this opportunity, Mahabe\nIn short as the Imperial army had gone towards Thatah, M\u0101habet Kh\u0101n was ordered to join it there. In the meantime, Prince Parviz died. As Sharif Kh\u0101n had entrenched himself in the fort of Thatah, Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n's army marched back to the Dakhin. M\u0101habet Kh\u0101n after reaching Thatah sent letters to Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, avowing his loyalty, and Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n being conciliated, M\u0101habet Kh\u0101n entered the former's service. In consequence, the \u0160\u016bbah of Bengal was transferred from Kh\u0101nahz\u0101d Kh\u0101n, son of M\u0101habet Kh\u0101n, to Mukkaram Kh\u0101n, son of Munazzam Kh\u0101n, and the Province of Kh\u0101n, leaving some Rajput troops to guard the bridge, marched up to the Imperial tent with a large number of Rajput cavalry. At the time, the Emperor was reposing in the Kh\u0101kh\u0101n\u0101. M\u0101habet Kh\u0101n fearlessly broke open the door, and entered it with about 500 Rajput cavalry, and paid obeisance to the Emperor. The Emperor coming out of the tent, seated himself on the Imperial Palanquin, which had lain in front of the tent. M\u0101habet Kh\u0101n came quite close to the palanquin, and addressed the Emperor as follows: \"Fearing that through the vindictiveness and malice of Asif Kh\u0101n, I should be disgraced, tortured and killed, I have dared to take this daring step of personally throwing myself on the Imperial protection. Sire, if I deserve to be killed and punished, kill and punish me in your Imperial presence\" (p. 256, Fasc. 3, Iqbalnamah). In the meantime, M\u0101habet Kh\u0101n's Rajput cavalry surrounded the Imperial tent from all sides. Then M\u0101habet Kh\u0101n told the Emperor that that was the usual time for the Emperor to go out hunting, and asked the Emperor to mount a horse. The Emperor mounted a horse, and went out some distance and then leaving the horse mounted an elephant. M\u0101habet Kh\u0101n in hunting dress accompanied the Emperor and led the latter to his own camp. Finding that Nur Jahan Begam had been left behind, he led back the Emperor to the Imperial tent, but in the meantime Nur Jahan had gone across the river and had joined her brother, Asif Kh\u0101n and was busy concocting measures to rescue the Emperor. After some days, by adoption of an ingenious and a bold stratagem\u2014when the efforts of all the Imperial officers had failed\u2014Nur Jahan succeeded in rescuing her Royal Consort, and in banishing M\u0101habet Kh\u0101n, who was sent in disgrace to Thatah. (See p. 276, Fasc. 3, Iqbalnamah-i-Jahangiri) Mahabet Khan subsequently joined Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n in the Dakhin.\n\n1 In the Iqbalnamah, \"Sharifu-l-Mulk\" it appears that Prince Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n had gone from the Dakhin to invade the province of Thatah. Then Sharifu-l-Mulk, on behalf of Prince Shahriy\u0101r, held the Fort of Thatah with 4,000 cavalry and 10,000 infantry. On hearing the news, the Emperor Jahangir sent an Imperial army to repel Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n's invasion, and M\u0101habet Kh\u0101n was sent on the same errand. Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n was obliged to raise the siege, and to march back to the Dakhin via Gujrat. (See Iqbalnamah and also Masir-ul-Umara, Pers. text, Fasc. 3, pp. 281-282).\n\n2 Mukkaram Kh\u0101n was a son of Shaikh Bayazid Muaggam Kh\u0101n, grand-\nPatna was entrusted to Mirza Rustam Safavi. It is said that on the day the patent transferring the \u015eubahdari of Bengal from Kh\u0101nahz\u0101d Kh\u0101n to Nawab Mukarram Kh\u0101n was drawn up at Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d (Delhi), Sh\u0101h Neamatullah Firuzpuri composing a Qasidah (an Ode) in praise of Kh\u0101nahz\u0101d Kh\u0101n, transmitted it to the latter, and in this Qasidah, there was one line which was indicative of Kh\u0101nahz\u0101d\u2019s supercession, and that line was this:\n\n\u0645\u0646 \u062f\u0631\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0627\u06cc \u06af\u0644 \u062e\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0647\u0648 \u0645\u0646\u062f\u06cc\u0628\n\u0633\u0631\u0648 \u062a\u0648 \u0646\u0648\u0628-\u0627\u0631 \u0648 \u062a\u0645\u0627\u0634\u0627\u06cc \u062f\u06cc\u06af-\u0631\n\nTranslation:\n\nI am in love with thee, O budding rose, like a nightingale,\nThy cypress, however, is a new spring and a sight to others.\n\nWhen Kh\u0101nahz\u0101d Kh\u0101n perused the above lines, he anticipated his supercession, and made preparations to pack up. And after one month the Imperial order of recall was received by him.\n\nson of Shaikh Salim Chishti of Fatehpur Sikri. Jahangir conferred on Shaikh Bayazid the title of Muazzam Kh\u0101n and made him \u015eubadar of Delhi. Muazzam Kh\u0101n\u2019s son, Mukkaram Kh\u0101n, was a son-in-law of Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n I, Jahangir\u2019s Viceroy in Bengal, and rendered important services under the latter. He conquered Kuch Hajo (a portion of Kuch Behar) and captured its zemindar or Rajah, Parichat (Padshahnamah 11, 64), and for some time remained as Governor of Kuch Hajo. Later, he was appointed Governor of Orissa, and conquered Khurdah (South Orissa) and annexed it to the Delhi Empire. In the sixteenth year, he came to court, and was made \u015eubadar of Delhi. In the 21st year, he was sent to Bengal as Governor in the place of Kh\u0101nahz\u0101d Kh\u0101n, Mahabat Kh\u0101n\u2019s son.

A gale upset his boat, and he was drowned in the river with all his companions.\n\n1 See n. ante.\n\nThe author of the Iqbalnamah-i-Jahangiri mentions that Mirza Rustam Safavi was appointed by Jahangir \u015eubadar of Vilayet-i-Behar and Patna, in the 21st year of the Emperor\u2019s reign. (See p. 280, Fasc. 3, Pers. text, Iqbalnamah-i-Jahangiri, and also Musir-ul-Umara).\n\n2 Later on in the text, he is described as a Saint, in whom Prince Sh\u0101h Shuj\u0101 had great faith.\nNEZ\u0100MAT OF NAWAB MUKKARAM KH\u00c2N.\n\nIn the 21st year of the Emperor's accession, corresponding to 1030 A.H., Mukkaram Kh\u00e2n was appointed to the Nez\u0101mat of the \u0160ubah of Bengal. Many months had not elapsed, when by chance, an Imperial firman came to his address. The Kh\u00e2n in order to receive it, advanced.\u00b9 As the time for afternoon prayer had arrived, he ordered his servants to moor his boat towards the bank, so that he might turn to business, after finishing prayer. The boatmen attempted to take the barge towards the bank. At this time, a strong wind blew, and sent the boat adrift. A severe gale coupled with a storm-wave, caused the boat to sink. Mukkaram Kh\u00e2n with his companions and associates was drowned, and not a single man escaped.\u00b2\n\nNEZ\u0100MAT OF NAWAB FID\u0100\u012a KH\u00c2N.\u00b3\n\nWhen news of Mukkram Kh\u00e2n being drowned reached the Emperor in the 22nd year of the Emperor's accession\n\n\u00b9 This incident illustrates the solemn personality of the 'Great Mughal' in those days, and the ceremonial homage paid him by his officers. The practice of advancing several miles to receive imperial orders and firmans, existed throughout the Mughal regime.\n\n\u00b2 See similar account in Iqbalnamah-i-Jahangiri, Fasc. 3, Pers. text, p. 287.\n\n\u00b3 \"Fidai Kh\u00e2n\" and \"J\u0101n Nis\u0101r Kh\u00e2n\" or \"Janbaz Kh\u00e2n\" were his titles, his name being Mirza Hedaitullah. He should not be confounded with Mir Zarif who also received the title of \"Fidai Kh\u00e2n.\" When Mir Zarif received this title of Fidai Kh\u00e2n, Mirza Hedaitullah who held the same title from before, received the new title of \"J\u0101n Nis\u0101r Kh\u00e2n\" from Shah Jah\u0101n the Emperor. In the beginning, in the reign of Emperor Jahangir, Mirza Hedaitullah was \"Mir Bahr-i-Nawarah\" or Admiral of the Imperial Fleet, and being patronised by Mah\u0101bet Kh\u00e2n, he advanced rapidly in influence. In the quarrel between Mah\u0101bet Kh\u00e2n and Emperor Jahangir, he took sides with his patron, Mah\u0101bet Kh\u00e2n, and subsequently fled to Rohtas. On return in the 22nd year of Jahangir's reign, he was appointed Viceroy of Bengal, in succession to Mukkaram Kh\u00e2n, who had been drowned, the arrangement entered into being that he should yearly remit from Bengal, in the shape of presents, five lacs for the Emperor and five lacs of rupees for the Empress Nur Jah\u0101n (no doubt, over and above the annual Imperial revenues). In Shah Jah\u0101n's reign, he was recalled from Bengal and received Jaunpur in tiyul (or jagir) and subsequently was appointed Faujdar of Gorakpur. He then helped Abdullah Kh\u00e2n, Governor of\ncorresponding to 1036 A.H., Nawab Fidai Khan was appointed Viceroy of the Subah of Bengal. Since at that period, besides rare silks and other presents and gifts, no specie used to be presented to the Emperor, at this time, contrary to the former practice, it was settled that every year five lacs of rupees as present to the Emperor and five lacs of rupees as present to Nur Jah\u0101n Begam\u2014in all ten lacs of rupees should be remitted to the Imperial Exchequer.\n\nWhen on the 27th of the month of Safar 1037 A.H., Emperor N\u016bruddin Muhammad Jahangir, whilst returning from Kashmir, died at Rajor, his son Abul Muzzafar Shahabuddin Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n (who was then in the Dakhin) marched out, and through the noble exertions of Asaf Jah Asaf Khan (after destroying and extirpating his brothers) ascended the Imperial throne at Delhi. Then the Subah of Bengal was transferred from Fidai Khan to Q\u0101sim Khan.\n\nBehar, in the conquest of Bhojpur or Ujjain. (See Maasir-ul-Umara, p. 12, Vol. 3).\n\n1 This Fiscal Provincial Contract under Fidai Khan is also noted in the Iqbalnamah-i-Jahangiri, Fasc. 3, Pers. text, p. 291.\n\n2 In the Iqbalnamah, \"28th Safar (Sunday) Emperor Jahangir died in the 22nd year of his reign, whilst returning from Kashmir towards Lahore.\" He was buried at Lahore in a garden which had been laid out by his beloved Consort, the Empress Nur Jah\u0101n. (See Iqbalnamah, Fasc. 3, p. 294).\n\n3 His titles were \"Asif Khan Asif Jah,\" his name being Mirza Ab\u016bl Hasan. He was a son of 'Itmad-ud-daulah, and the eldest brother of the Empress Nur Jah\u0101n Begam, and he was father of Arjumund Banu Begam alias Mumtaz Mahal, the beloved Consort of Emperor Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, (whose memory is enshrined in marble by the Taj at Agra). In the 9th year of Jahangir's reign, he was appointed to the Mansab of Sh\u0101h hazari, and subsequently raised to a haft hazari, and was also appointed Subadar of the Panjab, and Vakil or Prime Minister. In 1037 A.H. when Jahangir on return from Kashmir died on the way near Rajor, Nur Jah\u0101n (who espoused the cause of Prince Sh\u0101hriyar) wanted to imprison Asif Khan (who espoused Prince Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n's cause), but Asif Khan could not be seized or brought back. Asif Khan sent a swift runner, named Benaresi, a Hindu, to Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n who was then in Gujrat. Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n quickly marched out to Agra, where he was installed as Emperor, whilst Sh\u0101hriyar and other princes were soon imprisoned and made away with. On his accession, Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n gave Asif Khan the title of \"Em\u012bn-d-daulah,\" and made him a \"Nah hazari.\" He died at Lahore in 1051 A.H. \"\u0648\u06c1 \u0627\u0635\u0641 \u062e\u0627\u0646;\" is a chronogram which yields the above date. (See Maasir-ul-Umara, p. 151, Vol. I).\nWhen Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n succeeded to the Nez\u0101mat of Bengal, like his predecessors in office, he devoted himself to the affairs of\n\nIt is strange that the Riy\u0101s should give such a meagre account of the Administration of Nawab Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n, the first Bengal Viceroy appointed by Emperor Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n. Yet this Administration is peculiarly interesting and significant from the modern stand-point, as the chronicle of this administration contains, for the first time, a reference to a conflict (no doubt, then unimportant) between the Christian European merchants in Bengal and the Musalman Viceroys of Bengal. To supplement the account of this Musalman Viceroy with some additional facts gleaned from the Maasir-ul-Umaru, would therefore be interesting.\n\nQ\u0101sim Kh\u0101n was a son of Mir Murad of Jnain (in the Vilayet of Baihaq). Mir Murad was a leading Sayyid of that place, whence he migrated into the Dakhin. He was brave and a capital archer, and was engaged by Emperor Akbar to train up Prince Khurram. He was subsequently appointed Bakhsh of Lahore, in the 46th year of Akbar's reign. His son, \"Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n\" (this was evidently his title, his actual name is not given in the Maasir) was a man of culture and literary habits. Under Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n Q\u0101si\u1e6di Far\u016bqi (Jahangir's Bengal Viceroy), Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n served as Khasanqhi or Treasurer-General of Bengal. Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n took particular interest in training him up. Some time after, Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n was lucky in getting married to Manijah Begam, sister of the Empress Nur Jah\u0101n. This matrimonial alliance was a turning point in Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n's fortune; he was soon advanced in rank and dignity. The witty courtiers of the time called him \"Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n Manijah.\" He soon became an associate of the Emperor Jahangir. Towards the end of Jahangir's reign, he was appointed \u0160\u016bbadar (or Viceroy) of Agra. In the first year of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n's reign, the Emperor (Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n) raised him to the Mansab of Panjhasari, and appointed him \u0160\u016bbadar (Viceroy) of Bengal, in place of Fid\u0101 Kh\u0101n. During his stay in Bengal (during Jahangir's reign), Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n had become personally apprised of the excesses practiced by the Christians (Portuguese, obviously) resident in the Port of Hughli. For instance, Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n had come to know that these often took unauthorised leases of adjoining parganas, oppressed the tenantry of those parganas, and sometimes by tempting offers, converted them to Christianity, and even sent them to Farang (or Europe). Further these Christians (Portuguese, obviously) carried on similar malpractices even in parganas, with which they had no connection. Further, these Christians, under the pretext of carrying on trading transactions, had in the beginning established some ware-houses which they had gradually and clandestinely, by bribing local officers, converted into large fortified buildings. In consequence, the bulk of the trade which had found its way, hitherto, to the old Imperial emporium at S\u0101tgaon, was diverted to the new port of Hughli. In consideration of the above circumstances, the Emperor Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, whilst sending Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n to Bengal\nadministration, and to the putting down of disturbances. In the sixth year of Shah Jah\u0101n's accession, he marched against the Christians and Portuguese who had become insolent in the port of Hughli, and after fighting expelled and defeated them. As a reward for this service, he received favours from the Emperor, but he soon after died.\n\nNEZ\u0100MAT OF NAWAB 'AZAM KH\u0100N.\n\nAfter this, Nawab 'Azam Kh\u0101n was appointed to the Nez\u0101mat of Bengal. As he could not properly discharge the as his Viceroy, gave the latter instructions to expel the foreign Christian (Portuguese) traders from the port of Hughli. Accordingly, in the 4th year of Shah Jah\u0101n's reign, Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n sent his son 'Insitull\u0101h Kh\u0101n in company of Allahyar Kh\u0101n and other officers to Hughli, and he sent also by the sea-route via Chittagong another company of troops on a fleet of vessels from the Imperial Nawar\u0101h or Fleet stationed in Dacca, so that the Portuguese might not escape by water, giving out at the same time that the expedition had as its objective Hijli. These besieged Hughli, and, after the fighting was protracted to three months and a half, succeeded in storming it, and in expelling the Christian (Portuguese) traders from it. 2,000 Christians were killed in the fighting, 4,400 were taken prisoners, and 10,000 Indian captives that were in the hands of the Portuguese were released, and 1,000 Musalman soldiers got killed in the fighting. Three days after this victory (in 1041 A.H.) Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n died of disease. He built the Cathedral Mosque at Agra in Angah Kh\u0101n bazaar. (See p. 78, Vol. 3, Maasir-ul-Umara).\n\n1 A'zim Kh\u0101n's real name was Mir Muhammad Baqir, his titles being \"Iradat Kh\u0101n,\" and subsequently \"A'zim Kh\u0101n.\" He was a Sayyid of Sava which is in Ir\u016bq. On arrival in India, he was appointed Faujdar of Sialkot and Gujrat, through the interest taken in him by \u0100\u1e63if Kh\u0101n Mirza Ja'far, who married to him his daughter. Then he was presented to Emperor Jahangir, who gave him (on the recommendation of Eminu-d-daulah \u0100\u1e63if Kh\u0101n) a good Mansab and the office of Imperial Khansaman. In the 16th year of Jahangir's reign, he was appointed Subadar (Governor) of Kashmir and next Mir Bakhshi under the Emperor directly. On Shah Jah\u0101n's accession to the throne, Shah Jah\u0101n raised him to the rank of Panjhasari, and also to the office of visier of the Supreme Diwan. In the second year of Shah Jah\u0101n's reign, he was set to reform the Revenue Administration of the Provinces in the Dakhin. In the third year, he received the title of \"A'zam Kh\u0101n,\" and was employed by the Emperor for chastising Kh\u0101n Jahan Lodi and for the conquest of the Nizam Sh\u0101hi kingdom in the Dakhin. Though he succeeded in dispersing Kh\u0101n Jahan's force, and though he stormed the fort of Dharwar, his services in the Dakhin\nduties of a Governor, the work of administration fell into confusion. The Assamese, making an incursion, invaded and ravaged many of the pargannahs within the Imperial domains, and along with much riches and effects captured and carried away 'Abdus Salam,' who had gone on an expedition to Gauhati with 1,000 Cavalry and numerous infantry. When this news reached the Emperor, the latter superseded 'Azam Khan, and appointed Islam Khan, who had much experience in the work of administration and was one of the principal 'Omaris of Jahangir, to the office of Subadar of Bengal.\n\nRULE OF NAWAB ISLAM KHAN.\n\nWhen Nawab Islam Khan was appointed Subadar of Bengal, as he was an experienced and sagacious ruler, on his arrival in did not satisfy the Emperor, who sent him to Bengal as Viceroy, in succession to Qasim Khan, who died in the 5th year of Shah Jahan's reign. He continued in Bengal as Viceroy for three years only, and in the 8th year was transferred to Allahabad, and subsequently to Gujrat, and lastly to Jaunpur, where he was Rector of the Jaunpur University, and died in 1069 A.H., in his 76th year, and was buried in a garden which he had laid out on the banks of the Jaunpur river. His daughter was married to Prince Shih Shuja (after the latter had lost his first wife, a daughter of Mirza Rustam Safavi). He possessed many good qualities, and was very strict in auditing the accounts of 'Amils (Collectors of Revenue). (See Maasir-ul-Umara, p. 174, Vol. I).\n\nThis 'Abdus Salam would seem to be the Abdus Salam (son of Musagam Khan, Subadar of Delhi) who opportunely reinforced Shujaat Khan at the decisive battle near Dhaka (Dacca) with the Afghan leader Osman Lohani. He would seem, therefore, to have been a brother of Mukkaram Khan (another son of Musagam Khan) who was Governor of Bengal and who was conqueror of Kuch Hajo (or Kuch Behar) and Khurdah. 'Abdus Salam at the time would seem to have been Governor of Kuch Hajo, in succession to his brother Mukkaram Khan, and to have invaded Assam. (See n. ante). The Alamgirnamah (p. 680, Fasc. VII, Pers. text) calls him \"Sheikh Abdus Salam,\" and states that towards the early part of Shah Jahan's reign, he was 'Faujdar' of 'Hajo' (that is, Kuch Hajo, or western part of Kuch Behar), and that at Gauhati he together with many others was captured by the Assamese, and that, to chastise the Assamese, an expedition to Assam was shortly after (during the Viceroyalty of Islam Khan II alias Mir Abdus Salam) sent out under command of Sadiat Khan (Islam Khan's brother), but that the expedition reached only Kajal (which is on the frontier of Assam), and did not result in any decisive issue, as Islam Khan was shortly after recalled by the Emperor to assume the office of Imperial Vizier at Delhi.\nthe \u0160ubah, he vigorously set himself to the work of administration. He organised a punitive expedition against the refractory Assamese, and also planned to conquer Koch Behar and Assam. Marching towards those tracts and fighting many battles, he chastised those wicked tribes, recovered the Imperial mahals which had been over-run by the latter, and marched against Koch Behar. After much fighting, he stormed numerous forts, and then extirpated the refractory Assamese. At this juncture, Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n was recalled by Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, for the purpose of being installed in the office of Vazir. And order was sent to Nawab Saif Kh\u0101n to the\n\n1 Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n Maghad\u012b; his actual name was Mir Abdus Sal\u0101m, and his titles were \u201cIkhtiy\u0101s Kh\u0101n\u201d and subsequently \u201cIsl\u0101m Kh\u0101n.\u201d He should not be confounded with \u201cIsl\u0101m Kh\u0101n Chishti Faruqi,\u201d whose real name was Shaikh \u2019Alau-d-din, and who was Viceroy of Bengal, under Emperor Jahang\u012br.\n\nMir Abdus Sal\u0101m was in the beginning a Munshi or Secretary of Prince Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n. In 1080 A.H. (during Jahang\u012br\u2019s reign), he was Vakil-i-Darbar or Prince Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u2019s Political Agent at the Imperial Court (Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n being engaged at the time in affairs connected with the Dakhin), and at the same time received the title of \u201cIkhtiy\u0101s Kh\u0101n.\u201d When dissensions broke out between Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n and Emperor Jahang\u012br, Mir Abdus Sal\u0101m joined Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n. On Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u2019s accession to the throne, he raised Mir Abdus Sal\u0101m to the rank of Chaharhas\u016bri, bestowed on him the title of \u201cIsl\u0101m Kh\u0101n,\u201d and appointed him Bakhshi and subsequently Governor of Gujrat, with command of Five Thousand. In the 6th year, on the recall of \u0100gam Kh\u0101n (the Bengal Viceroy), Mir Abdus Sal\u0101m alias Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n Maghad\u012b was appointed Viceroy of Bengal. In the 11th year of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u2019s accession, he achieved several notable triumphs, viz., (1) the chastisement of the Assamese, (2) capture of the son-in-law of the Assam R\u0101jah, (3) capture of fifteen Assam forts, (4) capture of Srighat and Mando, (5) successful establishment of Imperial military out-posts or Thanas in all the mahals of Koch Hajo (the western portion of Koch Behar), (6) capture of 500 Koch war-vessels. Manik Rai, brother of the R\u0101jah of Arrakan, also at this time came to Dhaka (Dacca) and took refuge with Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n. In the 13th year (in the text, correctly, 11th year), Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n was called back by Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n from Bengal, and installed in the office of Imperial Vazir. He was subsequently appointed Viceroy of the Dakhin, where he died at Aurangabad in the 21st year of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u2019s reign, in 1057 A.H. He was buried in a mausoleum at Aurangabad. He was a learned scholar, a brave general and a sagacious administrator. (See Maasir-ul-Umara, p. 162, Vol. I).\n\n2 Saif Kh\u0101n Mirza \u0160afi was a son of Amanat Kh\u0101n. He married Malik\u0101h B\u0101nu, sister of Empress Mumt\u0101z Mahal, and a daughter of Aj\u012bf Kh\u0101n Em\u012bnuddaulah, and was thus closely connected with Emperor Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, by marriage. He first became Diwan of the \u0160ubah of Gujrat, and for his victory over \u2019Abdull\u0101h Kh\u0101n under daring circumstances, was appointed \u0160ubadar of\neffect that the Nizamat of Bengal was assigned to Prince Muhammad Shuj'a, and that until the latter's arrival, he should, as Prince's Deputy, carry on the work of Bengal administration. As Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n, in the very midst of fighting, had to march back to the Imperial presence, the work of Assam conquest was left incomplete, and his departure was a signal for fresh disturbances amongst the Assamese. This happened towards the end of the 11th year of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n's reign.\n\nRULE OF PRINCE MUHAMMAD SHUJ'A.\n\nIn the 12th year of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n's reign, Prince Muhammad Shuj'a arrived in Bengal, and made Akbarnagar or Rajmahal the Gujrat, and also received the title of \"Saif Kh\u0101n.\" He was subsequently appointed by Emperor Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n to be Governor of Behar (where at Patna he built several lofty public edifices). [Safiabad town, near Jamalpur in Monghyr, I guess, was built by him, and is named so after him. There is still a place in it called \"\u015eafi Sarai\" or \"\u015eafi's inn.\" If my memory serves me aright, I found a big well in Monghyr town near the Club, which bears an inscription to show that it was built by Saif Kh\u0101n]. In the 5th year of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n's reign, he became Governor of Allahabad; in the 8th year, he was selected as Governor of Gujrat, and next appointed Commandant of Agra. In the 13th year, when Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n Mashadi was summoned back from Bengal to Delhi, to assume charge of the portfolio of Imperial Vazarat, Bengal was assigned to Prince Sh\u0101h Shuj'a. As the Prince was at the time away at Kab\u016bl, Saif Kh\u0101n received orders to administer Bengal on behalf of the Prince, during his absence. In the 13th year of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n's reign (in 1049 A.H.) Saif Kh\u0101n Mirza \u015eafi died in Bengal, and his wife Malikah B\u0101n\u0113 died the following year. (See Maasir-ul-Umara, p. 416, Vol. II).\n\n1 Prince Sh\u0101h Shuj'a was the second son of Emperor Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, whose other sons were (1) D\u012br\u0101 Shekoh, (2) Aurangzeb, and (3) Mur\u0101d. Sh\u0101h Shuj'a was married to a daughter of Mirza Rustam \u015eaf\u0101vi, and subsequently (on the death of his first wife) to a daughter of Nawab 'Asam Kh\u0101n (a former Bengal Viceroy). Sh\u0101h Shuj'a, on appointment to Bengal, temporarily removed the Viceregal Capital from Dacca to Rajmahal. He twice ruled over Bengal, that is, once for eight years, and again (after a break of two years) for another eight years. Sh\u0101h Shuj'a's rule over Bengal was marked by the introduction of financial reforms and by the growth of revenue. \"About 1659 A.O. he prepared a new rent-roll of Bengal, which showed 34 Sarkars and 1,350 mahals, and a total revenue on Khalsa and Jagir lands of Rs. 18,115,907 exclusive of aboobs.\" (See Blochmann's Contr. to history of Bengal and the Padshahnamah). Sh\u0101h Shuj'a was a lover of architecture, and he built numerous marble edifices in Rajmahal, Monghyr and Dacca. He also\nseat of his Government, and adorned it with grand and handsome edifices. The Prince deputed to Jahangirnagar or Dacca his Deputy and father-in-law, Nawab \u2018Azam Khan.\u00b9 The affairs of administration which had fallen into confusion by the departure of Isl\u0101m Khan, received now fresh elat. For a period of eight years, the Prince devoted himself to the work of administration. In the 20th year\u00b2 of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u2019s reign, the Prince was recalled to the Imperial presence, and Nawab \u2018Itaq\u0101d Khan was appointed to the Nizamat of the S\u016bbah of this country.\n\n---\n\nNIZAMAT OF NAWAB \u2018ITAQ\u0100D KH\u0100N.\n\nWhen Nawab \u2018Itaq\u0101d Khan\u00b3 being appointed to the Nizamat of Bengal arrived in this country, he ruled over Bengal for two extended his Bengal Satrapy by incorporating therein Sarkars Monghyr and Behar (see Alamgirnamah), but shortly after he received a check in his onward career by coming in collision with his clever brother, Aurangzeb, and at length fled to Arrakan where he perished.\n\n\u00b9 See n., ante.\n\u00b2 In the text \u1e62\u0101\u1e25ib is evidently a misprint for \u1e62\u0101\u1e25ib.\n\u00b3 \u2018Itaq\u0101d Khan Mirza Shap\u016br was a son of \u2018Itamd-u-daulah, and a brother of Asif Khan Mirza Abul Hasan, and therefore, a brother also of Empress Nur Jah\u0101n (Maasir-ul-Umara, p. 180, Pers. text, Vol. I., Fasc. II).\n\nProfessor Blochmann\u2019s list (p. 511, Aiw., Tr., Vol. I.), does not give his name. In the 17th year of Jahangir\u2019s reign, he was appointed Governor of Kashmir, and continued there for a long period. He was also raised by Emperor Jahangir to a command of five thousand. In the 6th year of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u2019s reign, he was recalled from Kashmir. In the 16th year, he was appointed Governor of Behar, and whilst there, in the 17th year, he organised and despatched an expedition to Palaun (Palamow) under Zabardast Khan, and defeated its semindar or Rajah, named Partab, who submitted to the Emperor, and agreed to pay an annual tribute of one lac of rupees. In the 20th year of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u2019s reign, when Prince Sh\u0101h Shuj\u0101 was recalled from Bengal, \u2018Itaq\u0101d Khan in addition to his Governorship of Behar was appointed Viceroy of Bengal, where he continued for two years. In the 23rd year of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u2019s reign (1060 A.H.) \u2018Itaq\u0101d Khan died at Agra. He was a man of great refinement and culture, and his aesthetic tastes led him to be one of the founders of a new and elegant style of architecture. He built a splendid palace on a new and improved design at Agra.\n\nIn Alamgirnamah (p. 111) \u2018Itaq\u0101d Khan is mentioned as a son of Em\u012bru-d-doulah Asif Khan. (See Massir-ul-Umara, Vol. I, Fasc. 2, Pers. text, p. 180).\nyears. In the 22nd year of Shah Jah\u0101n's reign, he was superseded; and Prince Muhammad Shuj'a was for the second time re-appointed to the Nizamat of Bengal.\n\nAN ACCOUNT OF THE RULE OF SHAH SHUJ'A, FOR THE SECOND TIME, AND THE END OF HIS CAREER.\n\nWhen, for the second time, Prince Muhammad Shuj'a arrived in Bengal, for eight years more he carried on vigorously the work of administration, and conquering other tracts added laurels to himself. In the 30th year of the Emperor's accession, corresponding to 1067 A.H., Emperor Shah Jah\u0101n fell ill. As the period of illness became protracted,\u00b9 and the Members of\n\n\u00b9 Emperor Shah Jah\u0101n fell ill at Delhi on 7th Zil-hajj 1067 A.H. (Alamgirnamah, p. 27). At the time of the Emperor's illness, Prince Dara Shikoh, the eldest son, was at Agra. Prince Shuj'a, the second son, was in Bengal; Aurangzeb, the third son, was in the Dakhin; whilst Prince Murad, the fourth son, was in Gujrat. Owing to illness, Shah Jah\u0101n was invisible to the public as well as to his ministers and officers, and great confusion in State affairs occurred, and Dara Shikoh went to the Emperor, and took into his hands the reins of Government. In order to make himself thoroughly master of the situation, Dara Shikoh aimed to keep the Emperor fully under his control, and so forcibly removed the Emperor together with all royal treasures from Delhi on 20th Muharram, 1068 A.H. (1068 in the printed Pers. text is a misprint) to Agra, which was reached on 19th Safar, 1068 A.H. In the meantime, Murad proclaimed himself King in Gujrat, whilst Shuj'a similarly proclaimed himself King in Bengal, and invaded Patna and Benares (Alamgirnamah, p. 29).\n\nDara Shikoh's plan was first to vanquish Shah Shuj'a, next Murad, and to reserve the final blow for Aurangzeb, whom he dreaded most. In pursuance of this scheme, he first detached a large army under the command of his son Sulaiman Shikoh together with Rajah Jai Singh to operate against Shah Shuj'a. The army under Sulaiman Shikoh on the 4th Rabi-al-Awwal 1068 A.H. reached Bahadurpur, a village on the banks of the Ganges, 2\u00bd kos from Benares, and 1\u00bd kos from Shah Shuj'a's encampment. Shah Shuj'a had brought with him a large number of Nawarah or war-ships from Bengal, and so was sanguine of success, and treating the foe with contempt, he had dispensed with all ordinary precautions of war. Sulaiman Shikoh made a feint retreat which further took in Shah Shuj'a, and then suddenly wheeling round, made a bold dash which completely surprised Shah Shuj'a, who leaving behind his tents, treasures, guns and horses, hastily got into a boat, and sailed down to Patna, thence to Monghyr, where he halted for some days. Sulaiman Shikoh's army pursued Shuj'a to Monghyr; and, then the latter quitting\nGovernment could not obtain audience with the Emperor, great confusion ensued in the affairs of the Empire. Since amongst the Monghyr, set out for Bengal. (See Alamgirnamah, p. 31). Whilst these events were transpiring in Bengal, Aurangzeb with his marvellous insight grasping the situation forestalled Dara Shikoh by making a move from Aurangabad towards Burhanpur on Friday, 12th Jamadi-ul-Awwal 1068 A.H. (Alamgirnamah, p. 48). After halting for a month at Burhanpur to get news of the state of things at Agra, Aurangzeb learnt that Dara Shikoh had detached a large army under Rajah Jaswant Singh, who had already arrived at Ujjain, in Malwa. This made Aurangzeb decide his plans. He immediately on 26th Jamadi-ul-Akhirah on a Saturday marched from Burhanpur, reached the banks of the Narbadda, crossed it, and on the 20th Rajab encamped at Dibalpur. On the 21st Rajab, setting out from Dibalpur, he met on the way Prince Murad, and won him over to his side (Alamgirnamah, p. 55), and reached Dharmatpur, a place 7 kos from Ujjain, and one kos from Rajah Jaswant Singh's army, and pitched his camp on the banks of a rivulet, called Chur Narainah. (Alamgirnamah, p. 56). Rajah Jaswant Singh was quite outwitted by this strategic move of Aurangzeb who had united his forces with those of Murad. Aurangzeb then inflicted a crushing blow on Rajah Jaswant Singh at Dharmatpur. (See charming description of this battle in the Alamgirnamah, Pers. text, pp. 61, 66 to 74). Marching quickly from Dharmatpur, Aurangzeb passed through Gwalior. In the meantime Dara Shikoh had marched to Dholpur (p. 85, Alamgirnamah), to oppose Aurangzeb's progress, and to prevent his crossing the Chanbal river. Aurangzeb quickly however crossed the Chanbal river at the ferry of Bhadureah, which is 20 kos from Dholpur, on the first day of the month of Ramzan. On the 7th Ramzan, the battle of Dholpur was fought, and Dara Shikoh was completely defeated by Aurangzeb. (See description of the battle of Dholpur in the Alamgirnamah, pp. 100 to 104). Dara Shikoh fled to Agra, and thence to the Panjab and other places, was eventually captured and beheaded. Shortly after his installation, Aurangzeb drew his force against Shah Shuj'a who had advanced, and occupied Rohtas, Chunar, Jaunpur, Benares and Allahabad. The battle between Aurangzeb and Shuj'a was fought at Kachwa, a place close to Korah, and resulted in Shuj'a's defeat. (See description of the battle in the Alamgirnamah, Pers. text, p. 248). After his defeat, Shuj'a fled to Bahadurpur, thence to Patna, thence to Monghyr which he fortified, and thence (owing to the treachery of Rajah Bahros, zamindar of Kharakpur) to Rangamati, and thence (owing to treachery of Khwajah Kamalu-d-din, zamindar of Birbhum) to Rajmahal, thence through minor places to Dacca, thence through Bhaluah and minor places to Arrakan, always heroically contesting every inch of ground against the hosts of Aurangzeb, led by his General Muazzam Khan alias Mir Jumla, but every time baffled by the treachery of so-called adherents, barring a noble band of Barha Syeds who clung to him to the last. (See pp. 495 to 561, Alamgirnamah, Pers. text).\nPrinces Royal, no one except Dara Shekoh was near the Emperor; the reins of Imperial administration were assigned to him. Dara Shekoh, viewing himself to be the Crown-Prince, fully grasped the threads of Imperial administration. Owing to this, Prince Murad Baksh in Gujrat had the Khutbah read after his own name, whilst in Bengal, Muhammad Shuj'a proclaimed himself King, and marshalling his forces, marched towards Patna and Behar, and advancing thence, reached the environs of Benares. On hearing this news, Dara Shekoh, during the serious illness of the Emperor, marched with the latter from Shahjahanabad (Delhi), to Akbarabad (Agra), on the 20th Muharram, 1068, A.H corresponding to the 31st year of the Emperor's accession, and on the 19th Safar, reached Akbarabad (Agra). From this place, Dara Shekoh detached Raja Jai Singh Kachhoah, who was a leading Rajah and a principal member of the Empire, together with other leading noblemen, such as Diler Khan, Salabat Khan and Izad Singh, and other officers holding the ranks of Panjhasari and Chakharhasari, besides a large army composed of his own and the Imperial troops, along with guns and armaments, under the general command of Sulaiman Shekoh, his eldest son, in order to fight against Muhammad Shuj'a. Accordingly, these marched from Agra on the 4th of the month of Rabiul-Awwal of the aforesaid year, and set out on the aforesaid expedition. And after marching several stages, and passing through the city of Benares, these encamped at the village of Bahadurpur (which is situated on the bank of the Ganges at a distance of two and a half kroh from the city of Benares) to a distance of one and a half kroh from Muhammad Shuj'a's army. Both the armies exhibited military strategy and tactics, and sought for an opportunity to surprise the other. In consequence neither side made a sally. On the 21st Jamadiul-Awwal, the Imperialists made a feint as if to shift their camp, but suddenly wheeled round, and rushed Shuj'a's army, which was completely taken by surprise. On hearing the news of the feint retreat of the Imperialists on the previous day, Shuj'a had neglected his war-preparations, and was fast asleep. Being thus taken by surprise, he woke up from his slumber, and mounting a female elephant, he moved about restlessly. But the game was already up, especially as Raja Jai Singh making a dashing flank movement from the left side, closed in upon him. Seeing no alternative, Shah Shuj'a got into his war-vessels which he had brought\nup from Bengal, and sailed down swiftly, abandoning his treasures, guns, horses, baggages and tents. Sailing swiftly down Patna, he reached Mungir, and prepared to fortify it, and halted there for some days. Sulaiman Shekoh's army, after plundering and ravaging and slaughtering and capturing, followed up Muhammad Shuj'a, and reached Mungir. Muhammad Shuj'a, finding it impossible to stand his ground there, fled with the swiftness of lightning and air, and entered Akbarnagar (Rajmahal). The Imperial army reduced to subjection the Subah of Patna and Behar. But in the meantime, Aurangzeb had marched from the Dakhin towards the Imperial Presence, and on the outskirts of the Narbadda had fought an engagement with a numerous horde of Imperialists, and after sanguinary fightings had inflicted a signal defeat, and had marched to Shahjah\u0101nabad, and entered the Capital. Deputing his eldest son, Sultan Muhammad, to be near the Emperor, Aurangzeb put the latter under surveillance, and killed Dara Shekoh after much warfare, and in the holy month of Ramzan 1069 A.H. ascended the Imperial throne of Delhi. Sulaiman Shekoh, on hearing the news of Dara Shekoh's defeat, gave up the pursuit of Shah Shuj'a, and retreated towards Shahjah\u0101nabad (Delhi). Muhammad Shuj'a fancying that the struggle between Dara Shekoh and Aurangzeb would be a protracted one, thought his opportunity had come, and by the bad advice of Alivardi Khan and Mirza Jan Beg and other members of his Government,\n\n1 The Alamgirnamah, p. 31 (from which the account here in the text appears to be borrowed) says: \"From Monghyr to Patna became annexed to the Satrapy (iqta) of Dara Shekoh.\"\n\n2 Aurangzeb moved from the Dakhin in 1068 A.H., inflicted a crushing defeat on Dara Shekoh's troops led by Maharaja Jaswant Singh at Ujjain, and also defeated Dara Shekoh near Agra, and then informally proclaimed himself Emperor in 1069 A.H. (See Alamgirnamah, pp. 59 to 86, and pp. 87 to 108).\n\n3 Dara Shekoh, after his defeat by Aurangzeb near Agra, fled to Delhi, and thence to Lahore, and after various adventures in the Panjab, Gujrat and Kabul was captured by Jiwan, zamindar of Dadar, and made over to Aurangzeb who caused him to be imprisoned and subsequently slain, and his body buried in the mausoleum of Humayun at Delhi. (See Alamgirnamah, pp. 433 and 408). Those who take an interest in Dara Shekoh's adventures after his flight, will find a full account of the same in the Alamgirnamah. Dara Shekoh was a free-thinker and a pro-Hindu, and if he had succeeded to the throne, he would have out-Akbared Akbar in his pro-Hindu policy. Aurangzeb was the reverse of Dara Shekoh; he was a champion of Isl\u0101m, and an iconoclast like Mahmud of Ghazni or Shahabu-d-din Ghori.\nrefurbishing his sword, laid claim as his heritage to the suzerainty of Bengal, and with a large and formidable army marched towards the Capital of Hindustan. As before Shuj'a's arrival, the struggle in Hindustan between Aurangzeb and Dara Shekoh had terminated, and Aurangzeb had already mounted the Imperial throne, on hearing this news of Shuj'a's march, Aurangzeb with his entire army of Hindustan swiftly marched, and at Kachwah the two armies encountered each other, and a battle was fought.\n\nThe armies were arrayed on both sides,\nThey stood forth like mountains on a plain.\nWhen the armies from both sides approached each other,\nFrom the dark dust that arose, the universe turned dark.\nWhen from both sides they struck up drums of war,\nThe lion-like heroes spread their claws to smite.\nTumult arose from drums,\nThe ear of the world was deafened.\nFrom guns and muskets, rockets and arrows,\nSecurity in the world fled to a corner.\nFrom the smoke of gun-wagons that mingled with the atmosphere,\nThe sky became hidden from the world's view.\nThe spear warmed in slaughtering,\nAnd whispered messages of destruction into the ear of Life.\nThe lightning of the sword kindled fire so much,\nThat it burnt the harvest of existence.\nThe fire of warfare blazed up so keenly,\nThat it scorched the heart of Mars aloft on the sky.\n\nAfter much exertions and fightings, Aurangzeb's army was defeated. Aurangzeb, however, with a number of noblemen and some gunners, stood his ground on the battle-field. Alivardi Kh\u0101n, the generalissimo of Sh\u0101h Shuj'a's force, attempted to capture Aurangzeb and checkmate him. As God has bestowed greater wisdom on Sovereigns than on the mass of mankind, and as in military affairs, Sovereigns are endowed with a more accurate perception of the situation, that wise sovereign (Aurangzeb) observing the adage that \"war is fraud,\" deceived the aforesaid Kh\u0101n by holding out to him the chance of being appointed Prime Minister, and said that if the latter could induce Muhammad Shuj'a to\ndismount from his elephant and to mount a horse, he would win this game. The aforesaid Kh\u0101n, seduced by the bait held out by Aurangzeb, played false with his own old benefactor, and spoke to Muhammad Shuj'a as follows: \"Victory has been already achieved by our army, and the enemy's force has been defeated. As cannon-balls, and rockets and arrows are raining from every side, it is possible that the Royal elephant might be hit; it is therefore advisable that your Highness should dismount from your elephant and mount a horse. By the good luck of your Highness, I would immediately capture and fetch 'Alamgir.\" Instantly as Sh\u0101h Shuj'a mounted a horse, the aforesaid Kh\u0101n sent information to 'Alamgir. 'Alamgir immediately adopted the ruse of causing the music of victory to be struck up. And since the army did not find Sh\u0101h Shuj'a on the elephant, news spread in the army about the victory of 'Alamgir and the defeat of Sh\u0101h Shuj'a. Shuj'a's force fled panic-stricken, thinking that Shuj'a had been killed. Although Shuj'a made exertions to stop the panic and prevent the flight, these were in vain. Hence the adage is \"Shuj'a lost a winning game.\" The army of Aurangzeb collecting together, made an onslaught. When Sh\u0101h Shuj'a found that he had lost the game, he was obliged to take to flight, and fled to Bengal, and fortifying the passes of Teliagadhi and Sakrigali, he entrenched himself at Akbarnagar (Rajmahal). 'Alamgir appointed Nawab Mu'azzam Kh\u0101n, Kh\u0101n-i-Khanan, the Generalissimo, to be Subadar or Viceroy of Bengal. And detaching twenty-two renowned noblemen, like Nawab Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n, Diler Kh\u0101n, Da\u016bd Kh\u0101n, Fateh Jang Kh\u0101n, and Ihtisham Kh\u0101n, etc., under the command of Sult\u0101n Muhammad, to pursue Sh\u0101h Shuj'a, Aurangzeb himself triumphant and victorious marched back towards the Capital (Delhi).\n\n---\n\nVICEROYALTY OF NAWAB MU'AZZAM KH\u0100N,\nKHAN-I-KHANAN.\n\nWhen Nawab Mu'azzam Kh\u0101n was appointed Subadar of Bengal, he marched towards Bengal with a large army. As the passes of Teliagadhi and Sakrigali had been fortified by Sh\u0101h Shuj'a, viewing the forcing of those defiles to be a difficult operation, with twelve thousand soldiers he swiftly marched to Benga\nby way of Jharkand\u00b9 and the mountains. When the contending armies approached each other, Sh\u0101h Shuj\u2018a finding it impracticable to tarry at Akbarnagar (Rajmahal) caused \u2018Alivardi Kh\u0101n, who was the root of all this mischief, to be slain, himself retired to Tanda, and erecting redoubts, fortified himself there. When the two forces approached each other, separated by the river Ganges, one day Sh\u0101rif Kh\u0101n, who was a source of mischief, and Fateh Jang Kh\u0101n, getting into boats, crossed over to the northern bank, and they were similarly followed by others. From the northern side of the bank, as soon as Sharif Kh\u0101n landed, the soldiers of Sh\u0101h Shuj\u2018a gave battle. Nearly seventy persons who had reached the banks were killed and slaughtered. The remaining boats retired from the middle of the river. Sult\u0101n Shuj\u2018a ordered the wounded persons to be killed; but Sh\u0101h Neamatullah Firuzpuri expostulated. Sh\u0101h Shuj\u2018a who had great faith in this Saint made over to the latter Sharif Kh\u0101n together with other wounded prisoners. The Saint nursed them, and after their wounds had healed up sent them back to their army. But Sult\u0101n Muhammad, desiring to desert to his uncle, came alone to meet the latter, and receiving much kindness from his uncle, stayed on with him. Sult\u0101n Shuj\u2018a gave his daughter in marriage to him. Sult\u0101n Muhammad, on the side of Sult\u0101n Shuj\u2018a, fought several battles with the Imperialists, consisting of the Kh\u0101n-i-Khanan\u00b2 and Diler Kh\u0101n, &c.\n\n\u00b9 The Alamgirnamah indicates that at the time Sh\u0101h Shuj\u2018a had halted at Monghyr, fortifying the place. Then Rajah Bahroz, zamindar or Rajah of Kharakpur, who professed loyalty to Sh\u0101h Shuj\u2018a, but in reality was a traitor secretly intrigued with Aurangzeb\u2019s general, Mir Jumla alias Mu\u2019azzam Kh\u0101n, and showed the latter another route across the hills to the east of Monghyr. In covering this route, Mir Jumla had to make a detour of several miles; and Sh\u0101h Shuj\u2018a finding that he was being out-flanked, instantly sailed down on his war-vessels from Monghyr Fort to Rangamati and Rajmahal, and on the way fortified the passes of Teliagadhi and Sakrigali, which were then regarded as the \u2018key\u2019 to Bengal.\n\n\u00b2 A full account of his life will be found in the Maasir-ul-Umara, Vol. III, p. 530, Pers. text.\n\nFrom it, it appears that his name was Mir Muhammad Sa\u00efd Mir Jumla, and his titles were \u201cMu\u2019azzam Kh\u0101n, Kh\u0101n-i-Khanan Sipasalar.\u201d He came from Ardastan, first served under Sult\u0101n Abdullah Qutb Sh\u0101h, ruler of Golkondah, where he attained great eminence. Falling out with Qutb Sh\u0101h, he joined Prince Aurangzeb who was then in the Dakhin. His great services were (1) the conquest of Bijapur, (2) the extirpation of Sh\u0101h Shuj\u2018a, (3) the conquests of Kuch Behar and Assam. He was a statesman of great sagacity\nAt length, on finding Sult\u0101n Shuj'a negligent and apathetic, Sult\u0101n Muhammad went over again to the side of the Imperialists, and from thence to the presence of Emperor Aurangzeb at Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101nabad, where he was imprisoned. And orders were repeated to the Kh\u0101n-i-Khanan to pursue Sult\u0101n Shuj'a. In short, one day when Diler Kh\u0101n, etc., crossed the river at Pagl\u0101ghat, Diler Kh\u0101n's son, with a number of efficient men, was drowned. Sult\u0101n Shuj'a with his dependants and adherents, getting into war-vessels which had been brought up from Jahangirnagar (Dacca), set out for the latter place. The Kh\u0101n-i-Khanan also followed him up by land. Finding it impossible to make a stand at this place either, Sult\u0101n Shuj'a with a number of followers took the road to Assam, and from thence proceeded to Arrakan, and took shelter with the ruler of that tract, who was a Syed, and in a short time he died there, either owing to the treachery of the ruler of that tract, or from natural disease. When in the period of anarchy under Sult\u0101n Shuj'a, Bhim Narain, Rajah of Kuch Behar, becoming daring, with a large force attacked Ghoraghat, and foresight, and as a general, he was matchless in his day. (See Maasir-ul-Umara, p. 555, Vol III, Pers. text).\n\n1 Details of Sult\u0101n Muhammad's desertion to Sh\u0101h Shuj'a, and his subsequent secession, are given in the Alamgirnamah.\n\n2 Details of Sh\u0101h Shuj'a's fightings and adventures are given in the Alamgirnamah. See notes, ante.\n\n3 The description in the Alamgirnamah, pp. 557 to 562, shows that the ruler of Arrakan was neither a Syed nor a Mussulman, but a Buddhist. It also appears from the Alamgirnamah that setting out from Tandah on boats, Sult\u0101n Shuj'a reached Dacca (Jahangirnagar) where his eldest son Zainu-d-din had been from before. Zainu-d-din had arranged with the Rajah of Arrakan to escort Sult\u0101n Shuj'a to Arrakan, on the latter's arrival at Dacca. At this time, Man\u016br Kh\u0101n, a zamindar of Jahangirnagar, proved obstructive to Zainu-d-din's plans, and so he (Man\u016br) was first chastised with the help of the Arrakanese. Starting from Dacca on boats, guarded by the Arrakanese, Shuj'a passed through Dhapa (4 kos from Dacca), Siripur (12 kos north of Dacca), Bhaluah (which then formed the southern limit of the Mughal dominions in Bengal), and thence to Arrakan. One who cares to note names of old Bengal towns, may profitably read this portion of the Alamgirnamah.\n\n4 In the Alamgirnamah (p. 676), he is called \"Bim Narain, zamindar of Kuch Behar.\" It is stated therein that hitherto he used to regularly pay tribute to the Emperor, but that during the chaos which arose owing to Emperor Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n's illness, and owing to Sh\u0101h Shuj'a march to Patna, in order to lay claim to the Imperial throne, Bim Narain ceased paying tribute, and invaded Ghoraghat or Bangpur and subsequently Kamrup,\nhe captured a large number of the Musalman residents, male and female, of that place, and with the object of conquering Kamrup, to which Province pertained the tracts of Hajo and Gauhati, and which was included in the Imperial domains, he despatched his minister named Sahnanath\u00b9 with a large force. On the news of this invasion, the Rajah of Assam\u00b2 shewing short-sightedness sent also a large force by land and water towards Kamrup. Mir Lutfullah Shirazi, who was Faujdar of the Province of Kamrup,\u00b3 seeing from both sides torrents of invasion overtaking him, and despairing of relief, and being certain about the absence of Imperial auxiliaries, quickly got into a boat, and reached Jahangirnagar or Dacca, and rescued himself from the impending danger. And Sahnanath, not being able to cope with the Assamese, acting up to the saying: \u201cTo return is better,\u201d retired to his own country. The Assamese, without contest, conquered the province of Kamrup, swept it with the broom of plunder, carried by force to their own country all and everything, including the moveable and immoveable effects of the people, pulled down the edifices, left no trace of fertility, and reduced the whole province to one plain, level ground. As Sultan Shuj'a was occupied with his own affairs, the infidels of Assam finding an opportunity conquered the environs of mauza Kadi Bari, which is five stages from Jahangirnagar, and placing a garrison at the village of Tabsilah near Kadibari, raised the standard of daring and insurrection. Consequently, when the Kh\u0101n-i-Khanan reached Jahangirnagar, after devoting himself for some time to administrative business, he collected war-vessels and artillery and other armaments, and leaving Ihtisham Kh\u0101n to protect Jahangirnagar (Dacca) and its environs, and appointing Rai Bhogati Das Shuj\u0101'i to charge of financial and internal affairs, in the 4th\n\nAccording to the Iqbalnamah-i-Jahangiri (p. 110), Laghmi Narain, \u201cs\u0101m\u012bndar of Kuch Behar\u201d also used to pay homage and tribute to Emperor Jahangir.\n\n\u00b9 In Alamgirnamah (p. 678), \u201cBholanath.\u201d\n\u00b2 His name was Ji dhaj Singh. (Alamgirnamah, p. 678).\n\u00b3 See Alamgirnamah, a contemporary record, p. 678. Lutfullah Shirazi, the Faujdar of Kamrup, retired on war-boats from Kamrup to Jahangirnagar (Dacca). The Koch also withdrew, on finding that the Assamese had invaded Kamrup. The Assamese advanced up to Karibari which is five mansal from Dacca, and established a military out-post at Mast Salah, close to Karibari. (See Alamgirnamah, p. 679).\nyear\\(^1\\) of Emperor Aurangzeb's accession, corresponding to 1072 A.H., he set out on an expedition towards the conquest of the Kingdoms of Kuch Behar and Assam, sending forward by the river-route, artillery, &c., and himself pushing on by land with a force of twenty thousand efficient cavalry and numerous infantry, vid a hill which was frontier of the Imperial dominions. In a short time, he subdued the Kingdom of Kuch Behar up to Gauhati. After this, he pushed on with his forces to conquer Assam. In the meanwhile, the Emperor's order came, directing him to march to Arrakan, in order to rescue the children and ladies of the household of Sh\u00e2h Shuj'a from distress and from imprisonment at the hands of the Arakanese, and to send them up to the Imperial presence. The Kh\u00e2n in reply to the Imperial order, represented that the Imperial troops were busy in fighting to conquer the provinces of Kuch Behar and Assam, and that to march to Arrakan, without accomplishing the conquest of the aforesaid two provinces, was opposed to expediency, and that he would postpone the expedition to Arrakan to next year, and that this year, he would set about subjugating the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The Kh\u00e2n-i-Khanan (Muazzam Kh\u00e2n) set out from Khizapur (which has been identified to be a place close to Narainganj) with war-vessels, on 17th Rab\u00eeul-Awwal 1072 A.H., for the conquest of Kuch Behar, leaving Mukhalis Kh\u00e2n as Governor of Akbarnagar (Rajmahal) and Iktisham Kh\u00e2n as Governor of Jahang\u00eernagar (Dacca) and Bhagot\u00ee Dass as Diwan under the latter, and reached Baritollah, the Imperial frontier out-post. The Alamg\u00eern\u00e2mah mentions that at the time three land-routes lay to Kuch Behar:\u2014(1) vid the Murang! (2) vid the Doars, (3) vid Ghoraghat or Rangpur. The Kh\u00e2n-i-Khanan sent out scouts to ascertain which route was the best, and then chose the Ghoraghat route, by which he pushed on with his forces by land, sending out another force by the river on war-vessels, the two forces to give cover to each other, and to cover equal distance each day. (See Alamg\u00eern\u00e2mah, p. 683, for a full description of this expedition to Kuch Behar and Assam). The war-vessels passed through a river which joins Ghoraghat with the Brahmaputra, and the Imperialists reached Kuch Behar town. The Rajah (Bim Narain) fled to Bhutan, his minister Bholanath fled to the Murang, and the Imperialists stormed Kuch Behar town, and named it Alamg\u00eernagar. Syed Sadiq, Sadr or Chief Justice of Bengal, shouted out the Azan from the terrace of the Rajah's palace; the Rajah's son Bishannath embraced Isl\u00e2m, and Isfandyar Beg (who received the title of Isfandyar Kh\u00e2n) was left by the Kh\u00e2n-i-Khanan as Faujdar of Kuch Behar, with Qazi Samu (who was formerly Sh\u00e2h Shuj'a's officer) as Diwan of Kuch Behar. (See p. 694, Alamg\u00eern\u00e2mah, Pers. text).\nprovinces of Kuch Behar and Assam. After this, on the 27th Jamadial-sani of the aforesaid year, marching from Gauhati, he entered Assam. Fighting by water and by land, he pushed through the jungles, mountains and rivers. And wherever he went he established a garrison. Storming the citadel and palace of the Rajah of that country after much fighting, he gained much booty. After successive battles,\\(^1\\) the hapless Assammese, being routed, fled and escaped to the hills of Bhutan, and the whole of Assam was conquered. At length, the Rajah of Assam drawing the rein of submission to the neck, and wearing the ring of obedience on the ear, deputed a trustworthy envoy to wait on the Kh\u0101n-i-Khanan with gifts and presents, and agreed to pay tribute to the Emperor, and also sent his own daughter with goods, rare silk-stuffs, elephants and other rarities in charge of Badli Phukan, for Emperor Aurangzeb. The aforesaid Phukan, with all the presents, reaching the outskirts of the city of Dacca, encamped and prepared\n\n\\(^1\\) After conquering Kuch Behar, the Kh\u0101n-i-Khanan (Muhammad Kh\u0101n), proceeded to the banks of the Brahmaputra, with his military and naval forces, and passed through Rangamati. Diler Kh\u0101n commanded the van, whilst Mir Murtazza was in charge of the artillery. The Kh\u0101n-i-Khanan occupied Jogikhapa, and appointed Ataullah to be Faujdar of that place, and then occupying Sirighat, stormed Gauhati, and appointed Muhammad Beg to be Faujdar of Gauhati. After halting at Gauhati for some time, the Kh\u0101n-i-Khanan marched out, when the Rajahs of Darang (named Makrupanj) and of Daromariah offered tribute and submitted. The Kh\u0101n-i-Khanan then stormed the fort of Jamdhara, appointed Syed Mirzai Sahswari (together with Syed Tatar and Rajah Kishin Singh) to be Thansadar of Jamdhara, and appointed Syed Nasir-ud-din Kh\u0101n (together with other Imperial officers) to be Thanadar or commandant of Kilabari, captured 400 Assamese war-vessels with numerous guns and armaments and stores, occupied Solagadh, Lakhokadh, Diwalgaoon, Kajpur, and Kargon or Gargoon, the capital of Assam, captured 208 battering guns, 100 elephants, and 3 lacs of specie in gold and silver, 675 other guns, 1,000 war-vessels, with other armaments and stores. (See description of Gargoon, the old Assam capital, in p. 728, Alamgirnamah). When the rains set in, the Kh\u0101n-i-Khanan encamped at Mathurapur, which was a high place, about 3 kroh distant from Gargoon, leaving Mir Murtazza with Rajah Amar Singh and others in charge of Gargoon, and appointing Syed Muhammad as Diwan, and Muhammad 'Abid to confiscate the effects of the Rajah who had fled to the hills of Kamrup, and Meana Kh\u0101n in charge of Salpani, and Ghazi Kh\u0101n in charge of Dewpani, and Jallal to protect the banks of the Dhank river. The whole of Dakhinkul and portions of Uttarkul were subdued by the Imperialists (p. 736, Alamgirnamah).\n\n29\nto set out for the Imperial capital. In that the sorcery of the Assamese is well known, the Kh\u0101n-i-Khanan was affected by their sorcery. For some time he was laid up with pains on the liver and heart; daily these increased, and pointed to a fatal termination. Although he got himself treated, no beneficial effect was perceptible. He was, therefore, obliged to leave behind Mir Murtaza and other commanders. Leaving garrisons at every strategic point, he proceeded to a hill; and from thence, owing to his illness increasing, he set out on a barge for Jahangirnagar (Dacca). At a distance of two kroh from Khizrpur, on the 2nd of the month of Ramzan 1073 A.H., corresponding to the 5th year of Emperor Aurangzeb\u2019s accession, he died on board the vessel. Subsequently, the garrisons of the outposts evacuated their outlying posts, but the Rajah\u2019s daughter stayed behind with the tribute, as the Rajah refused to take her back into his household.\n\n1 After the rains set in, the Rajah of Assam with his army came down from the hills of Kamrup, and gave some trouble to the Imperialists, who suffered also from ague and diarrhoea. At length, the Rajah sued for peace, and the Kh\u0101n-i-Khanan, who had fallen ill, granted it on the following terms (Alamgirnamah, p. 808):\n\n1. That the Rajah should send his sister and a daughter of Rajah Patam together with 20,000 tolas of gold, and 20,000 tolas of silver, and 20 elephants by way of tribute, besides 15 elephants for the Kh\u0101n-i-Khanan, and 5 elephants for Diler Kh\u0101n.\n\n2. That in course of next 12 months, the Rajah of Assam should send 3 lak tola of silver and 90 elephants to the Emperor, and that every year he should send 20 elephants to the Emperor, and that till the payment of the indemnity, 4 leading Assamese noblemen should be given as hostages.\n\n3. That Darang (in the Uttarkul) and Biltali and Domariah (in the Dakhinkul) should be subject to the Emperor, and that in the Dakhinkul, the delimitation line between Assam and the Imperial dominions should be the river Kalang, and in the Uttarkul it should be Alibarari. Rahmat Ban\u016b, a daughter of the Assam Rajah, was given in marriage to Prince Muhammed Azam, her dower being one lak and Rs. 80,000. (See Maasir-i-Alamgiri, p. 73).\n\n2 See Alamgirnamah, p. 812. He was Viceroy of Bengal from 1658 to 1663. He died near Dacca in 30th March, 1663. In 1661, he had threatened to expel the English merchants from Hughli.\u2014These, however, prudently submitted and were pardoned, on their tendering an apology through their Hughli agent, Trivisa, on their agreeing to pay Rs. 8,000 annually. See Wilson\u2019s Early Annals of the English in Bengal, Vol. II, p. 35.\nVICEROYALTY OF NAWAB AMIR-UL-UMARA\nSHAISTA KHAN.\n\nAfter the Kh\u0101n-i-Khanan's death, the office of Subadar of Bengal being conferred on Amir-ul-Umara Shaista Khan, the latter arrived in Bengal. For some years devoting himself to administrative work, he administered justice and promoted the welfare of the people. Bestowing grants of villages and lands on widows of nobles and others in straitened circumstances, he made them well-off. Spies informed the Emperor, whereon Shaista Khan himself went to the latter and explained the true state of things. As the alleged dissipation of the Imperial revenue was unfounded, he was re-invested with the Khellat of appointment, and sent back to Bengal. But as the Kh\u0101n was\n\n1 Shaista Khan was a son of Eminu-d-daulah A\u1e63af Khan, and a brother of Mumtaz Mahal, wife of Shah Jahan. His name was Mirza Abu Talib, and his titles were \"Amir-ul-Umara Sh\u0101ista Khan.\" In the reign of Shahjahan, he became a Panjhasari and Nazim of Balaghat in the Dakhin, and subsequently Subadar of Behar and Patna, when he invaded Palson (Palamu) and subdued Partab, Zamindar of Palson (Palamu). He then became Subadar of Malwah and Gujrat and subsequently Viceroy of all the Subahs of the Dakhin. He rendered good services to Aurangzeb in the latter's fightings with Dara Shekoh and Salaiman Shekoh. On the death of Mir Jumla, he became Viceroy of Bengal in 1664 A.C. He chastised thoroughly the Mag pirates who harried the coasts of Bengal, and wrested from them (chiefly through the exertions of his own son, Buzurg Umed Khan) the fort of Chittagong, and named it Islamabad (Alamg\u012brn\u0101mah, p. 940). He subsequently became a Hafthasari and Viceroy of Agra, where he died in 1105 A.H. He was held in high esteem by Emperor Aurangzeb, who lavished on him high privileges and semi-regal honours. With all his greatness, Sh\u0101ista Khan was meek and humble, courteous and affable, just and liberal, brave, noble, and enlightened. He established mosques with madrassas, rest-houses, bridges, and roads throughout India, and his charities were wide. He was married to a daughter of Sh\u0101h Nawaz Khan, son of Abdur Rahim Khan Khanan. He forms a prominent figure in connection with the early commercial enterprises of the English East India Company. (See Wilson's Early Annals of the English in Bengal, Vol. I, pp. 48\u201499 and 111, and Hunter's History of British India,\" Vol. 2, pp. 238\u2014266). Nawab Sh\u0101ista Khan's Viceroyalty in Bengal forms a brilliant chapter in the Mughal annals of Bengal, as during it many useful public works, such as serais, bridges, and roads were constructed, and the economic and agricultural condition of the people attained an unique degree of prosperity, in that a maund of rice sold in the bazar for two annas only (See Maasir-i-Alamgiri, pp. 167 and 368, and Maasir-ul-umara, Vol. 2, p. 690).\n\n2 Shaista Khan was Aurangzeb's Viceroy of Bengal for a quarter of a\nnot desirous of staying in this Province, he used constantly to write letters to the Emperor, requesting permission to kiss the Royal feet, and begging deputation of some other officer to assume the office of \u1e62ubadar of this Province. At first his resignation was not accepted; but at length, owing to Shaista Khan's importunities, the Nizamat was bestowed on Nawab Ibrahim Khan, a son of 'Alimardan Khan Yar Ofudar. Traces of the beneficent administration of the Nawab Amir-ul-umara are known not only in Bengal, but throughout Hindustan. One is this, that during his Nizamat the cheapness of food-grains was so great that for a damri,\u00b9 one seer of rice could be purchased in the market. At the time of his return to the capital Shahjahanabad (Delhi), he caused the following inscription to be engraved on the western gate of Jahangirnagar (Dacca): \"Let him only open this gate that can shew the selling rate of rice as cheap as this.\" From his time onward till the r\u00e9gime of Nawab Shujand-din Muhammad Khan, this gate remained closed. In the period of the Viceroyalty of Nawab Sarfaraz Khan, the gate was again opened, as will be mentioned hereafter. The Katrah and other buildings of the 'Amir-ul-umara\u00b2 up to this day exist in Jahangirnagar (Dacca).\u00b3\n\ncentury with a short break, that is, from 1664 to 1680 A.C., He died in 1694 in his 93rd lunar year. For his parwana of pardon to the English in 1687, see Hunter's History Vol. 2, p. 260, f.n.\n\n\u00b9 A dam was equal to the fortieth part of the rupee, and a damri was equal to one-eighth part of a dam (See Ain-i-Akbari, Vol. I, p. 31), that is, 320 damris made up one rupee. Therefore, during Shaista Khan's Viceroyalty in Bengal, for one rupee 8 maunds of rice could be had, in other words, the price, per maund, of rice was two annas only.\n\n\u00b2 The Maasir-i-Alamgiri (p. 368) is highly eulogistic in praise of Nawab Shaista Khan. It says that he established numerous caravanserais and erected numerous bridges throughout India. His great achievements in Bengal were (1) the Conquest of Chittagong which was named by him Islamabad (for details see Alamgirnamah, p. 940); (2) the extirpation of the Mag pirates; (3) the improvement of the economic and agricultural condition of Bengal; and (4) construction of numerous useful public works. (See also Maasir-ul-umara, p. 690, Vol. II). During his Viceroyalty, Duldan Namjal, Rajah of Tibat (through the exertions of Saif Khan Subadar of Kashmir, Murad Khan, zamindar of Tibat-i-Khurd, and Muhammad Shafi envoy) submitted to Aurangzeb (pp. 921-932, Alamgirnamah).\n\n\u00b3 It is strange that the author of the Riyaz in his account of the Viceroyalty of Nawab Shaista Khan should have omitted all mention of the Nawab's greatest military achievements in Bengal, vis., the chastisement of\nVICEROYALTY OF NAWAB IBRAHIM KHAN.\n\nNawab Ibrahim Khan on being invested with the Khillat of the Nizamat of the Shibah of Bengal, arrived at Jahangirnagar the Mag and Portuguese pirates and the re-conquest of Chittagong. I therefore translate freely the following contemporary account from the Alamgir-namah (Pers. text, p. 943):\n\nAs the Mags emerging from Arrakan on war-vessels (Nawarah) and taking advantage of the struggle for supremacy between Aurangzeb and Shah Shuja, harried the coasts of Bengal, Emperor Aurangzeb sent out orders to his Bengal Viceroy, Nawab Shaista Khan, to take immediate steps for chastising the Mags. With this object in view, Nawab Shaista Khan first took steps to guard and fortify his southern frontier out-posts. He appointed an Afghan named Said with 500 rocketeers and musketeers to charge of the Noakhali out-post, Muhammad Sharif, Fanjdar of Hughli, with 500 rocketeers, 1,000 infantry and 20 guns to defend the out-post of Sankram-Kadah, and set Muhammad Beg Abakash and Abul Hassan with the Imperial war-vessels which lay at Siripur to patrol the river. From Siripur to 'Alamgirnagar covering a distance of twenty-one kroh, an embanked road so that it might not be flooded during the rains was also constructed under the Nawab's order, for military purposes. The Nawab then ordered Abul Hassan to bring round Dilawar, zamindar of Sandip, or to punish him, as the latter secretly sided with the Mags. Abul Hassan attacked Sandip and fought with Dilawar, who being hit by an arrow fled to the jungles. Meanwhile, the Arrakanese fleet came up to Sandip to render assistance to Dilawar. Abul Hassan prepared to assault the Arrakanese fleet, which withdrew, and then Abul Hasan, not pursuing it, retired to Noakhali. Nawab Shaista Khan, on hearing of this, sent another fleet consisting of 1,500 gunners and 400 cavalry, commanded by Ibn-i-Husain, Superintendent of the Nawarah (Fleet).\n\n---\n\n1 Ibrahim Khan was the eldest son of Amir-ul-Umara 'Ali Mardan Khan. On his father's death, he was made a Chahar hasari, and subsequently a Panjhasari. He became Subadar of Kashmir, of Lahor, of Behar, and of Bengal in quick succession. His sons were Zabardast Khan (who chastised the rebel Afghan, Rahim Khan) and Yaqub Khan (who became Subadar of Lahor). He was recalled from Bengal in 1109 A.H. (in the 41st year of Aurangzeb's reign), when Shahzadah Mohammad Azim, alias Azim-un-sh-Shan, was appointed in his place. (See Maasir-i-Alamgiri, pp. 71, 163, and 387, and Musaer-ul-umara, Vol. I, p. 295). The English merchants styled him \"the most famously just and good nabob\" (see Wilson's Early Annals of the English in Bengal, Vol. I, p. 124), as he allowed them to return from Madras and finally settle at Sutanuti (future Calcutta) in the first year of his Viceroyalty (1690), after Emperor Aurangzeb had that year granted a 'general pardon' to the English merchants, on their making a most humble submissive petition, and on their 'promising to pay a fine of Rs. 150,000' (See Hunter's India, Vol. 2, pp. 265-266).\n(Dacca) and devoted himself to administrative affairs. He unfurled to the oppressed the gates of justice and clemency, and did\n\nJamal Khan, Serandaz Khan, Qaramal Khan and Muhammad Beg, to reinforce Abul Hassan, to co-operate with the latter and occupy Sandip (Sondip), and to extirpate its zamindar, Dilawar. Ibn-i-Husain with this reinforcement moved up to Noakhali, which is in front of Sandip, and halted there with Muhammad Beg, in order to blockade the passage of the Arrakanese fleet. Abul Hassan with others then attacked Sandip, wounded and captured Sharif, son of Dilawar, and captured also, after severe fighting, Dilawar with his followers, and sent them prisoners to Jahangirnagar (Dacca) in charge of Maniar, zamindar of Jahangirnagar, and subdue Sandip. Nawab Shaista Khan, on getting news of the conquest of Sandip, appointed Abdul Karim, brother of Bashid Khan, to the charge of Sandip, with 200 cavalry and 1,000 infantry. The Feringis (Portuguese) were at this time siding with the Arrakanese, so Nawab Shaista Khan first took steps to detach the Feringis, and for this purpose sent out letters to some of the leading Feringis. Some of these letters falling into the hands of Karam Kibri, a Mag, who with a fleet was in the environs of Sandip, the latter communicated it to the Rajah of Arrakan, who lost confidence in the Feringis; and ordered that the Feringis should be deported from Chittagong to Arrakan. The Feringis of Chittagong getting scent of this set fire to many of the Arrakanese fleet, and fled to Noakhali in the Mughal dominions. Farhad Khan, Commandant of Bhaluah out-post, kept some Feringis with himself, and sent their leaders to Nawab Shaista Khan to Dacca (Jahangirnagar). The latter treated them generously. The Nawab then sent out an expedition to Chittagong in charge of his son, Buzurg Umed Khan, of Ikhtisaq Khan Barha, Sabal Singh Sinsudiah, Mianah Khan, Karan Khaji, with 2,000 cavalry. Orders were sent out to Farhad Khan, Thanadar of Bhaluah, to move up with Ibn-i-Husain and Manuar zamindar, with the fleet, and to Mir Murtaza, Superintendent of Artillery, to join Farhad Khan and to cover the latter's front. Captain Moore, Chief of the Portuguese in Chittagong, with his fleet was directed to render loyal services. Kamal, son of the former Rajah of Arrakan, who had taken shelter in Dacca in the reign of Emperor Shah Jahin, was also directed to go with Mir Murtaza, and to send conciliatory messages to the Mag Commander of Chittagong. Farhad Khan and Mir Murtaza proceeded by the land route, whilst Ibn-i-Husain, Muhammad Beg, and Manuar proceeded by the river route. These reached (setting out from Noakhali) Thana Jagdiah, on 16th Rajab; on the 18th Rajab, Farhad Khan with his followers crossed Finny river (Phani), and on the 24th Rajab reached near a tank, which was one day's distance from Chittagong, and then waited for the General-in-Chief, Buzurg Umed Khan. The latter on 21st Rajab crossed Finny river, and on 25th Rajab reached a point which was 10 kroh distant from Chittagong, and 8 kroh from Farhad Khan's encampment. The Imperial fleet halted at Domariah village, which was 20 kroh from Buzurg Umed Khan's encampment. On 27th Rajab, two naval engagements were\nnot allow an ant to be oppressed. As Emperor Aurangzeb was engrossed in fighting for twelve years in the Dakhin with Abul Hasan alias Tana Shah, the Ruler of that Province, and with Siva and Sambha Mahrattas, rebellious zamindars of Sattara, &c., disturbances broke out in several parts of the Empire owing to the Emperor's protracted absence from his capital. In the Subah of Bengal, in the district of Bardwan, Subha Singh, zamindar of Chitwah and Bardah, revolted, whilst Rahim Khan the cut-nosed, who was leader of the Afghans, joined the former with a contingent of Afghans. Kishan Ram, zamindar of Bardwan, who smarted under the former's oppressions advanced with his force to encounter him, and was killed. And the latter's wives and children, together with all his effects and fought, in which the Arrakanese were defeated. The Arrakanese fleet then moved up to the Karanphuli river. Under orders of Buzurg Umed Khan, Mir Murtaza cutting down the jungles, and laying down a road, moved up by land to near the Karanphuli, to re-inforce the Imperial fleet, Buzurg Umed Khan himself similarly moving up. A severe naval engagement took place in the Karanphuli river, in which the Magas were crushingly defeated, and Buzurg Umed Khan stormed Chittagong fort, captured the Arrakanese fleet, and subdued the whole tract of Chittagong, and 132 Arrakanese war-vessels, with guns, armaments and elephants, were captured. Emperor Aurangzeb ordered Chittagong to be named Islamabad, and conferred gifts on Nawab Shaista Khan, and raised his son Buzurg Umed Khan to the rank of Hazar-o-Pansadi, and Farhad Khan to the rank of Hazar-o-Pansadi, and conferred on Mir Murtaza the title of 'Majahid Khan,' and on Iba-i-Husain the title of Muzaffar Khan, and raised Mannar zamindar to the rank of Hazar-o-Pansadi. This conquest of Chittagong took place in the 8th year of Aurangzeb's reign.\n\nSee Alamgirnamah, p. 956.\n\n1 See pp. 269, 144, 143, 244, 245, 269, 285, and 309, Maasir-i-Alamgiri.\n\n2 See pp. 142, 211, 319, 332, 308, Maasir-i-Alamgiri.\n\n3 The text does not narrate another disturbance that had previously broken out on the Assam frontier. The Assamese had attacked the Imperial garrison at Gauhati, and killed its Faujdar, named Syed Piruz Khan. For the purpose of chastising the Assamese, an Imperial expeditionary force was sent out by Aurangzeb to Assam (Maasir-i-Alamgiri, p. 64).\n\n4 Chitwa or Chatwah is mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbari (see Jarret's Tr. Vol. 2, p. 141) as a pargana or mahal under Sarkar Madaran. I have failed to trace Bardha, which may be a misprint in the text for Balgarhi, another mahal under the same Sarkar, or for Bharkondah (var. Bhargodha), a mahal under Sarkar Sharifabad (see Ain, Vol. 2, p. 139).\n\n5 Bardwan appears in the Ain (Vol. 2, p. 139) as a mahal under Sarkar Sharifabad.\ntreasures, were captured, and his son, Jagat Rai, taking to his heels, fled to Jah\u0101ngirnagar (Dacca), which was the Viceregal capital of Bengal. On hearing of this, Nuru-l-l\u0101h Kh\u0101n, Faujd\u0101r of the Chakl\u0101h of Jasar (Jessore), Hugli, Bardw\u0101n, and Mednipur, who was very opulent and had commercial business, and who also held the dignity of a Sehhaz\u0101ri, marched out from Jasar in order to chastise and subdue the rebels. From the din of the enemy\u2019s march, considering himself unable to stand the onset, he retired to the fort of Hugli, and sought for help from the Christian Dutch of Chuchr\u0101h (Chinsurah). The enemy, on getting news of Nurullah\u2019s cowardice, promptly set to besiege the fort, and after skirmishes reduced the garrison to straits. And that coward, acting on Shaikh S\u2019adi\u2019s couplet:\n\n\u201cWhen you cannot vanquish the enemy by your might,\nYou ought to close the gate of disturbance, with largesses,\u201d\n\nthrowing away his treasures and effects, considered it lucky to save his own life. With a nose and two ears, clad in a rag, he came out of the fort; and the fort of Hugli, together with all his effects and property fell into the enemy\u2019s hands. From the occurrence of this disaster there was a universal commotion. The leading gentry and nobility of the town and suburbs, and the merchants and residents of the environs, together with their effects, took refuge in Chuchr\u0101h (Chinsurah), which was a place of security. The Dutch leaders sailed up to the foot of the fort with two ships loaded with soldiers and armaments, and by a shower of cannon-balls, they battered the buildings of the fort, and flooded the harvest of numerous lives with the torrent of destruction. Subha Singh, not arranging terms of peace, fled to Satgaon, close to Hugli, and there, too, not finding\n\n1 This Nurullah Kh\u0101n appears to have been subsequently promoted by Aurangzeb to the post of Deputy Subadar of Orissa (See Maasir-i-Alamgiri, p. 169).\n\n2 Ain, II, says: \u201cIn the same way that His Majesty (Emperor Akbar), for the prosperity of the Empire, has appointed a Commander of the forces for each Province, so by his rectitude of judgment, &c., . . . he apportions several pargannahs to the care of one of his trusty, just and disinterested servants, called a Faujdar.\u201d (See Ain-i-Akbari, Vol. 2, p. 40).\n\n3 Apparently, Jessore or Jasar at the time formed the head-quarters station of the Mughal Fanjdar of the Chakl\u0101h or Division, including Jessore, Hugli, Bardwan, and Mednipur districts.\nit practicable to tarry, retired to Bardwan, and under the lead of Rahim Khan marched thence with his rabble towards Nadia and Murshidabad, which was then called Makhugsabad. Amongst the women and children of the slain Kishan Ram that were captives in the oppressive grip of Subha Singh, the former's daughter was adorned with the ornaments of beauty and elegance and of chastity and modesty. That wretch of a villain (Subha Singh) plotted to stain the hem of the maiden's chastity with the filth of defilement. As fate would have it, that dog of a night wanted to pounce on that maiden,\u00b9 and through seduction of Satan, it stretched out its hand towards her. That lion-like maiden with the swiftness of the wink of blood-shedding eyes, by means of a sharp knife which she secreted with herself for such an occasion, cut him up from below the navel to the belly, and with the same sharp knife cut asunder the thread of her own life. When this world-consuming fire was extinguished, another arose in the person of that villain's brother, by the name of Himat Singh. The latter also resolved to set the world on fire, and attempted to plunder and pillage the Imperial domains. And Rahim Khan, owing to the strength of his rabble and clan, styled himself Rahim Shah. Placing crookedly on the head of pride the cap of vanity, and collecting a large number of low and ignorant badmashes, he redoubled the flame of insurrection,\u00b2 so that from Bardwan to Akbarnagar (Rajmahal) on the west of the Ganges, half the Province of Bengal was harried by him. And whoever amongst the Imperial adherents refused to submit to him was punished and tortured. Amongst them, in the environs of Murshidabad, there lived an Imperial officer, named Neamat Khan, with his family and dependants. When he refused to join Rahim Shah the latter, thirsty for his blood, ordered his head to be brought. Seeing the measure of his life full to the brim, Neamat Khan prepared to drink out of the cup of martyrdom, and advanced to the field. Tauhar Khan, his nephew, who was as brave as his name implied, spurring on his charger, made a brave onset. At length the forces of the enemy hemmed him in, and from every side attacked him, so that he drank the syrup of martyrdom, and his comrades, one after another, were levelled.\n\n\u00b9 Literally, \"Chinese deer.\"\n\u00b2 This opportunity was utilised by the English for fortifying their new settlement in Calcutta\u2014See Wilson's Annals, Vol. II, p. 147.\nround him on the bed of annihilation. Neamat Khan, on seeing this, without cuirass and armour, tying a sword to his unlined garment, mounted a swift charger, cut through the right and left wings of the enemy's force, and, dashing up to the centre, inflicted a cut on the head of Rahim Shah. As fate would have it, Neamat's sword striking against the latter's helmet broke. From ferocity of disappointed rage, putting his grip on Rahim's face and seizing his waist with the hand, by sheer strength, Neamat dismounted Rahim from his horse and threw him on the ground. With great agility then springing from his own horse, Neamat sat on the top of Rahim's chest, and drawing a dagger from his waist struck him on the throat. Accidentally, the dagger got entwined in the link of the cuirass of Rahim and did not penetrate through to his throat. Meanwhile, the adherents of Rahim Shah coming up wounded Neamat Khan, by inflicting cuts on him with swords and spears, so that he was disabled, and dragging him down from his saddle, they threw him down on the ground. Rahim Shah, recovering life in a way a second time, remained unhurt and unscathed. And they carried Neamat Khan to a tent, with his flickering life, in a state of fainting. From excessive thirst, he opened his eyes to signal for water. When the men of Rahim Shah brought a cup of water, his feelings revolted against his drinking it out of their hands, and thus with a parched lip he quaffed the goblet of martyrdom. The zamindars of the environs and the news-messengers, in succession, carried this woful news to Nawab Ibrahim Khan, to Jahangirnagar (Dacca). The Nawab, to whom the following couplet is applicable:\n\n\"Although possessed of the strength of a lion,\nIn seeking vengeance, he was flabby like a soft sword\"\n\nowing to pusillanimity, said: \"War causes the spilling of blood of God's creatures; what necessity is there that the blood of people on both sides should be shed?\" And when from messages and news-letters, the gist of this disaster reached the Emperor in the Dakhin, an Imperial order was despatched to Zabardast Khan, son of Ibrahim Khan, conferring on him the office of Fanjdar.\n\n1 Apparently, Zabardast Khan was appointed to the office of Fanjdar\nof the chaklahas of Bardwan, Mednipur, etc., insisting on the chastisement of the miscreant enemy, and directing the Nazims and Faujdars of the \u0160ubahs of Oudh and Allahabad and Behar, that, wherever they might get trace of the enemy, they should capture him with his women and children. It was also proclaimed that whoever would desert the enemy should be granted security of life, and whoever would join the enemy and thereby draw the paint of infamy on the face, should have his family extirpated. And so it came to pass. Shortly after, the \u0160ubahdari of Bengal and Behar was conferred on Prince \u2018Asimu-sh-shan, who was ordered to proceed to Bengal with a number of the Imperial officers.\u00b9 The noble Kh\u0101n, named Zabardast Kh\u0101n, on the very receipt of the Imperial order, fitting out a fleet of war-vessels armed with artillery, sailed up from Jahangirnagar (Dacca) with a numerous force, and spurred on the charger of war. Rahim Sh\u0101h, on hearing news of the approach of the Imperial army of vengeance, swiftly marched to the banks of the Ganges, with a large army, consisting of infantry and cavalry. Zabardast Kh\u0101n, mooring his war-vessels alongside the river-bank, quickly entrenched himself in front of the enemy\u2019s force, arrayed his troops for battle, and placed in front of the entrenchment of those Gog-like people the projecting parts of waggons, in the shape of Alexander\u2019s wall. On the next day, advancing from his entrenchment, he arrayed his troops, posting armed heroes and warriors in the right and left wings, in the centre, in the van, and in the rear. Placing the artillery in front, he advanced like the wave of the sea, and struck the kettledrum of war. When the din of call to battle resounded in the ear of Rahim Sh\u0101h, the latter became perturbed, but moved with his intrepid Afghan soldiers to encounter the Imperialists. From the side of the Imperialists, Zabardast Kh\u0101n ordered the artillery to be brought into action, and directed the discharge of muskets and war-rockets. The gunners and musketeers and rocketeers did not slacken their fire, whilst gallant combatants charged with their swords, and worked havoc in the enemy\u2019s ranks.\n\nof the chaklahas of Jasar, Hugli, Bardwan and Mednipur, in the place of Nurullah Khan, who was apparently recalled for his pusillanimity.\n\n\u00b9 It would appear, like Nurullah, Nawab Ibrahim Khan was also recalled promptly for exhibition of pusillanimity. The latter was a bookworm and a man of peace.\nreceived from the Emperor a special Khilat, together with a jewelled sword, a high Mansab and the Insignia of the Mahi Order, and was appointed Subadar of Bengal and Behar.\n\nFor the chastisement of the rebels, he started from the Dakhin with his two sons, named Sultan Karimuddin and Muhammad Farukh Sir for the Subah of Behar, and swiftly arrived in Behar via Subah Oudh and Allahabad. The Prince issued Royal mandates, as potent as God's decrees, summoning to his presence the Zamin-dars, 'Amils, and Jagirdars. These appeared in His Highness' presence with tributes and gifts, and were recipients of valuable Khilats according to their respective ranks. And attending to the administration of the State affairs, they paid in the revenue and taxes into the Imperial treasury. The fiscal and administrative affairs were entrusted to honest Diwans and thrifty Karkuns, and Tahsildars were appointed to charges of Circles and Mahals. All of a sudden, news of the victory of Zabardast Khan and of the defeat of Rahim Shah arrived through the medium of newsletters. Fancying that the fish of victory and triumph that was worthy of himself might be angled by another, who would go in for reward on account of good services, and fearing that Zabardast Khan, who was a grandson of Nawab 'Alimardan Khan, in recogni-\n\na daughter of Rup Singh Rathor. He was born on the 6th Jamadi-ul-Awal, 1074 A.H. (in the 8th year of Aurangzeb's reign). (See Maasir-i-Alamgiri, p. 49). He married in 1089 A.H. (in the 21st year of Aurangzeb's reign) a daughter of Kerat Singh, who received as jihas or dower Rs. 63,000, jeweleries, one palki, five dalis with embroidered and jewelled pillows. (See Maasir-i-Alamgiri, p. 167). He married in the 86th year of Aurangzeb's reign (1103 A.H.) a daughter of Buh-Allah Khan (Maasir-i-Alamgiri, p. 347). In 1108 A.H. (in the 41st year of Aurangzeb's reign), he succeeded to the Viceroyalty of Bengal, including Kuch Behar, in succession to Ibrahim Khan. (See Maasir-i-Alamgiri, p. 387). In 1114 A.H., Behar was added to his Bengal Viceroyalty (Maasir-i-Alamgiri, p. 470).\n\nThe Order of the Mahi was one of the most Exalted Orders founded under the Mughal regime in India.\n\nAli Mardan Khan Amir-ul-Umara rendered important services to the State in the reign of Shah Jah\u0101n, and rose to the offices of Subadar of Kamshir and the Panjab and to the rank of a Hafithasari. In 1050 A.H., he became Subadar of Kabul, and also subsequently received the title of Amir-ul-Umara. In 1056 A.H., he invaded Balkh and Badakhshan and partially subjugated those tracts. Subsequently he became again Subadar of Lahore. In 1067 A.H. he died, and was buried at Lahore. His rectitude of purpose, straightforwardness in conduct, firm loyalty, and sincerity combined with\ntion of such valuable services, might be invested with the office of Subahdar of Bengal, the ambitious Shahzadah, moving from Subah Behar, swiftly marched to Rajmahal, and spurring his horse for the chastisement of the rebels advanced with his large force to Bardwan. The Prince ignored Zabardast Khan's services, and failed to bestow on him a single word of praise or encouragement. The aforesaid Khan, becoming depressed by the apathy of the Shahzadah, and finding his great labours wasted, resolved to proceed to the Emperor. Caring not for the power of the Shahzadah, he struck the kettle-drum of march, and took the route to the Dakhin. Rahim Shah who, from fear of the fury of that lion of the forest of warfare, had been hiding like the fox and the jackal, in the holes of the mouse and the serpent, finding now an opportunity, brought back water into the rivulet of his ambition, and triumphantly made incursions on the frontiers of Bardwan, Hugli, and Nadia. Pillaging the inhabitants of that tract he desolated it, nay rendered it a den of wild beasts and a nest of owls and crows. After the departure of Zabardast Khan the Prince, with great self-reliance, despatched mandates and orders to Jahangirnagar (Dacca) for conciliating and reassuring the Zamindars and Faujdars. His Highness himself, slowly marching from Akbarnagar (Rajmahal), advanced stage by stage, studying the convenience of his troops. The Amils, Faujdars, and zamindars, with appropriate contingents drawn from their respective mahals, presented themselves before the Prince with gifts and tributes, and accompanied the latter in his Royal Progress. The ill-fated Rahim Shah, fancying the news of the approach of the Prince to be a fiction, like his own fate, was sleeping the sleep of negligence. When, however, the news of the approach of the Royal Army reached the ear of that wretch, he hurriedly and anxiously concentrated his Afghan levies who were scattered far and near, and prepared for warfare. That royal eagle of the summit of the Empire, caring not for that flock of sparrows,\n\nbeavery, soon gave him an unique position amongst the Imperial officers of his day, and he enjoyed the full confidence of his sovereign, who used to call him \"Yar Ofadar\" or the \"faithful friend.\"\n\nHis important public works were (1) the irrigation of a large canal joining the river Ravi with Lahore city; (2) the establishment of a splendid public garden called \"Shalamar\" together with aqueducts, reservoirs, and fountains, on the banks of that canal, close to Lahore. (See Maasir-ul-Umara, Vol. II, p. 807).\nset out unhesitatingly, without baggage and paraphernalia, and pitched his camp in the outskirts of Bardwan. There the Prince suspended the royal pearl of salutary advice to the ear of that contemptible prevaricator, promised reward in the event of acceptance, and threatened vengeance in the event of refusal. That dissembler treated the bright pearl of the order of the Prince ostensibly as the jewel of the ear, but covertly as the gravel of his own eyes, that is, apparently he shewed signs of submission, but in reality, he sowed the thorn of rebellion and dissimulation in the field of his heart. He besought to his assistance Khwajah Anwar, elder brother of Khwajah 'Asam, who was a high officer and a boon companion of the Prince, and in fact the latter's prime-minister, and represented that in case the Khwajah came and promised on oaths and re-assured his mind, next morning he would proceed in his company to the Prince's presence, to sue for pardon for misdemeanour. The guileless Prince, ignorant of the wiles of that traitor, assenting to his request, ordered the above Khwajah to proceed early in the morning to Rahim Shah's camp, and instructed him to reassure the latter and to fetch him to the Royal Darbar to publicly avow submission. Next morning the abovementioned Khwajah, following the order of his master, adopted no measures of precaution, and rode out with a few relations and friends. Halting in front of the camp of Rahim Shah, he sent information, and on horseback remained on the look-out. Hiding his armed Afghan soldiers in his tent, Rahim Shah was in pursuit of treachery. Opening towards the envoy the door of wiles and softness, he requested that the Khwajah should enter his camp. Fearing lest smoke might arise from the fire of the reptile, the above Khwajah hesitated to go in, and making promises summoned out Rahim Shah. When the demands of both sides resulted in a parley and the object of the mission remained unaccomplished, suddenly Rahim Shah with an armed force sallied out of his camp shouting and advanced in front of the Khwajah. From wounds of the tongue it culminated in wounds of the spear. Fathoming the water underneath the straw, Khwajah Anwar, regretted his coming, and wanted to return without ac-\n\n1 Khwajah Asam came to Agra from Badakhshan, and subsequently received the titles of \"Samgam-ud-daulah Khan Dauran Amir-ul-Umara.\" The Maasir-ul-Umara, p. 819, Vol. I, says his elder brother's name was \"Khwajah Muhammad Jafar-Khan.\" Dauran was wounded in the battle with Nadir Shah, and died in 1151 A.H.\ncompleting the object of his mission. Rahim Shah, advancing forward, commenced fighting. Being compelled to encounter him, Khwajah Anwar gallantly and bravely fought, and made heroic exertions, but being covered with mortal wounds, fell together with a number of his comrades. Finding the field deserted, the Afghans with swords rushed out and attacked the Royal camp of the Prince.\n\nWhen that scion of the Imperial family\nBehold perfidy in that prevaricator,\nAnd also in regard to the condition of Khwajah Anwar,\nNews arrived that his head had been severed from his body;\nHis face became cherry from rage,\nHe called for arms from the armour-bearer.\nHe placed the cuirass on the shoulder and the helmet on the head,\nFrom head to foot he became a figure of iron.\nHe suspended an adamantine sword,\nAnd placed tightly a dagger in his waist.\nHe tied one sunny shield to his shoulder,\nAnd placed a shining spear in his hand.\nHe hung a quiver from his waist,\nAnd threw round the shoulder a Kaianian bow.\u00b9\nHe tied a noose to the top of his howdah,\nAnd clutched with the hand an iron mace.\nHe gave order that the Generals of the army\nShould collect quickly near the Royal tents.\nAt his order, the battle-seeking army\nFlocked in towards the Prince.\nWhen the Prince mounted his elephant,\nHe looked like the sun on a mountain.\nThe kettle-drum of battle was struck, and the army moved,\nLike the river waving.\nHe advanced to the field and raised aloft his standard,\nAnd boldly set himself to put his troops in array.\nHe arranged his centre and wings:\nThe right and left wings, the rear and the van.\n\n\u00b9 The old Kaianian sovereigns of Persia or Iran were capital archers and marksmen. Their bows were famous for range and precision of shot. See Namai-Khusruan, p. 44, for an account of Kaianian Kings.\nFrom the overwhelming number of his force, and from\nthe Imperial prestige,\nThe world quaked with terror.\nHe rode up to the battle-field,\nBut was dilatory in delivering an assault.\n\nWhen the battle-field was arranged, and the cavalry and in-\nfantry, like the men at chess, were set in their proper places,\nRahim Shah made a hostile flank movement, and fought gallantly.\nA number of Afghan troopers clad in cuirass and armed with\ndaggers, by a desperate sally, galloped right through the ranks of\nthe Imperialists, reached the centre, and sought for the Prince,\nshouting out \"Azimu-sh-Shan.\" Attacking the Royal elephant\nwith their horses, they prepared to give the final checkmate. The\nImperial cavalry and infantry, unable to withstand the onslaughts\nof those villains, left the Prince in a corner before the enemy and\nfled. Thus the thread of the arrangement of the Imperial army\nwas snapped. Rahim Shah, breaking through the entrenchments,\nattacked the Prince's elephant. At this crisis, and at the sight\nof this impudent daring, Hamid Khan Quraishi, who was standing\nat a short distance, spurred on his charger like an arrow shot from\nits bow, attacked Rahim Shah, and said, \"Villain, I am Azimu-sh-\nShan.\" Promptly discharging a rock-piercing arrow from his\nquiver, he pierced Rahim Shah on the chest.\n\nHe pulled out his bow from its string\nAnd drew out his Khadang* arrow from its quiver.\nHe joined the arrow-notch to the ass's leather,\nAnd aimed at that giant.\nWhen the arrow-notch was shot to take aim;\nIt pierced through the breast of that fighting demon,\nPiercing right through his breast,\nIt figured like the balance from weight.\n\nIn quick succession Hamid Khan shot other arrows at the\nneck of Rahim Shah's horse, and laid low both its neck and head.\nRahim Shah, owing to two mortal wounds on the breast, was\n\n1 He was a son of Daud Khan Quraishi. See n. ante and p. 37 Maaser-ul-\nUmara, vol. 2.\n2 Khadang is the white poplar tree of which arrows and bows are\nprepared.\nfell to the ground. Hamid Khan with great agility sprang down from his horse, and sat upon Rahim Shah's chest, and severing the villain's head from his body whirled it round on a spear. At the sight of this, the cowardly Afghan soldiery faltered and fled, whilst the standards of those insolent villains were turned upside down. The zephyr of triumph and victory once again blew on the tails of the Imperial banners, and the Imperial band of victory and triumph struck up loudly, whilst cries of \"Allah, Allah\" resounded from the earth to the sky. The cavalry of the victorious Imperial army chased the vanquished to their tents, and whoever amongst young or old fell across the range of its career became the food of the crocodile of blood-drinking swords; whilst the rest who escaped the sword, scampered off, covered with wounds and racked by anxieties. Much booty and numerous captives fell into the hands of the Imperialists. The fortunate Prince, an associate of triumph and victory, entered Bardwan, and made a pilgrimage to the noble shrine of the saint Shah Ibrahim Saqq\u0101. Making votive offerings, the Prince entered the citadel, and sent a congratulatory message on this victory to the Emperor, and despatched troops for chastising the adherents and abettors of the miscreant Afghans. Wherever trace could be found of their whereabouts, they were captured and slaughtered, and in a short time the districts of Bardwan, Hugli, and Jasor (Jessore) were purged of the defilement caused by the Afghan raiders. The tracts that had been desolated by the ravages of these rebels once again became fertile. Jagat Rai, son of Kishan Ram, the slain Zamindar of Bardwan, was invested with the khilat of the hereditary Zamindari of his forefathers. In a similar way, other Zamindars of that tract who had been oppressed and banished by the Afghans, were re-assured by Royal Proclamations of goodwill, and re-installed in their hereditary ranks and dignities. Taking fresh settlements of the Khalsa mahals (crown lands) and of Jagirs, these commenced making collections of rent; whilst the holders of Tiyuls and Aimahs and\n\n1 In Stewart, \"Bahram.\" He was a saint who lived at Bardwan, but I have not been able to get details of his career.\n\n2 \"Tiyuls\" or \"Tuyuls\" and \"Jagirs\" are corresponding terms, and signify the same class of land-tenure. These were conferred for a specified time on Mansabdars in lieu of salaries, and also on others by way of reward during lifetime or a fixed period. In the early Mughal period, the word \"tiyul\" is frequently mentioned, but it frequently gives way to the word\nAltamghas re-entered into the possession of their respective mahals. Hamid Khan Quraishi, in recognition of his gallantry was rewarded by the Emperor with the advancement of his mansab, with the bestowal of the title of Shamshir Khan Bahadur, and with the office of Faujdar of Silhat (Sylhet) and Bandasil (?). And the other officers of the Prince, who had rendered good services, according to the measure of their services, and according to their ranks, were honoured with mansabs and dignities. The Prince halted in the fort of Bardwan, which contained the Residency of the Faujdars of that district; laid the foundations of buildings; and erected a Cathedral mosque. And in Hugli, he founded Shahganj, alias Jagir, from Akbar's time. In the time of Sher Shah, the Afghan king, the word Jagir is also frequently used. In the Ghoriyan, Khilji and Tughlak periods, the word 'Iqta,' corresponding to 'Jagir,' is frequently used. (See Tabaqat-i-Nasiri, Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi, and Ain-i-Akbari, Vol. I, p. 270).\n\nBesides the \"Jagirs\" or \"Iqtas\" or \"tiyuls,\" there was another class of land-tenures which were conferred for benevolent purposes, were hereditary (unlike Jagirs), and free from revenue and cesses, and imposed no obligations for military or other services. These before Mughal times were called milk, madad-i-mash, ayema and altamghah, but were denominated in Mughal times by the Qhaghtai word \"Sayurghal.\" An officer called Sadri-i-Jahan, or Administrator-General, was in charge of these Sayurghals. These were conferred on the following four classes of persons: (1) On enquirers after wisdom who have withdrawn from worldly occupations and make no difference between night and day in searching after knowledge; (2) on such as practise self-denial and have renounced society of men; (3) on such as are weak and poor and have no strength for enquiry; (4) on honourable men of gentle birth who from want of knowledge are unable to take up a profession.\" (See Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi, pp. 353, 382, and 558, and Ain-i-Akbari, Vol. I, pp. 268, 270, 271, 272).\n\nSher Shah was very liberal in conferring these aimahs and altamghas, which, however, were considerably resumed by Akbar who, on account of his hatred of the Ulama, deprived them of their madad-i-mash lands, and banished most of them to Bengal. (See note in Ain-i-Akhari, Vol. I, p. 270, and Badadoni, Vol. II, pp. 274, 276, 279).\n\nAltamgha, a Turkish word, meant a 'red royal seal or stamp' and also a 'royal grant' of rent-free tenure, which was perpetual, hereditary, and transferable. (See Ain, Vol. II, p. 57 n). In founding this system of Sayurghals or Altamghas, the Musalman Rulers were actuated by a desire to perpetuate the three aristocracies of birth, of character, and of intellect. Care was taken to also maintain more or less permanently the fourth aristocracy of wealth, as the Zamindars under Mughal Emperors were more or less permanent quasi-state functionaries.\n\nShahganj town lies between Bansbaria and Hughli towns.

He shewed an anxious solicitude to profit by the advice of saints and he exerted himself to promote the welfare of the realm. One day he sent Sultan Karim\u00fb-d-din and Muhammad Farukh-sir to invite over Sufi B\u00e2izid,\\(^4\\) who was the most glorious amongst the saints of Bardwan. On their approach the saint greeted them with the salutation of \"Salam Alaekum.\" Sultan Karim\u00fb-d-din, assuming the gravity of princely rank, did not respond; but Farukh-sir walking\n\nI was at Hughli in 1887, I saw at Shahganj an old dilapidated mosque which was said to have been erected by Prince Asimush-Shan.\n\n1 This is another saint of Bardwan, the details of whose career are unknown to me.\n\n2 There is nothing to wonder at in this, for one finds the same inviolate distinction in a more accentuated form was observed by another European Christian community in the 16th and 17th centuries. \"Moslems were to pay duty on all Merchandise. Portuguese were to be exempt.\" (See Hunter's History of British India, Vol. I, p. 145).\n\n3 Maulana Rum is the renowned Mystic or Sufi Persian poet. His name was Maulana Jalal\u00fb-d-d\u00een. He was born at Balkh in 604 A.H., and died in 672 A.H. He was a great saint. His Masnavi is a storehouse of spiritual treasures, and has well been described thus:\n\nSelflessness was the keynote to his teachings, which further inculcated the cultivation of a constant sense of Divine presence in all human actions. For instance, he says:\n\nAgain:\n\nThe word used is \"tamgha.\" \"In every Kingdom, Government taxes the property of the subject over and above the land-revenue, and this they call Tamgha.\" (See Ain-i-Akbari, Vol. II, p. 57).\nup barefooted, stood respectfully and after offering salutations communicated his father's message. The saint, being pleased with the courteous behaviour of Farukh-sir, took the latter by the hand, and said: \"Sit down, you are Emperor of Hindustan,\" and he offered prayer for Farukh-sir. The arrow of the saint's prayer reached the butt of Divine acceptance. As a result of courteous behaviour on the part of Farukh-sir, what the sire desired was bestowed on the son. When the saint arrived to meet 'Azimu-sh-Sh\u0101h, the latter advanced, and making apologies besought the saint's prayer for the attainment of the object which His Highness had in view. The saint said: \"What you seek, I have already bestowed on Farukh-sir, and now the discharged arrow cannot be recalled.\" Offering the Prince benedictions, the saint returned to his own closet. In short, being satisfied with the administrative methods and arrangements introduced in respect of the affairs of the tracts of the Chaklak of Bardwan, Hugli, Hijli, and Midnapur, &c., the Prince set out on Imperial war-vessels, constructed by Sh\u0101h Shuj\u0101, towards Jahangirnagar (Dacca). After arrival at Dacca, he set himself to organise the administration of that tract. When information about certain improper acts of the Prince like practices of Sauda-i-Kh\u0101\u1e63 and Sauda-i-Am, and the wearing of saffron-coloured red clothes at the time of the Holi, which is the Nauroz or New Year of the Hindus, through the medium of messages of news-writers and historiographers, reached Emperor Aurangzeb, the latter was annoyed. The Emperor wrote thereon to the Prince as follows: \"A Saffron-coloured helmet on thy head, a red garment on thy shoulder, thy venerable age verging on forty-six years; hurrah on thy beard and moustache!\" In regard to Sauda-i-Kh\u0101\u1e63 the Emperor wrote the following across the news-letter, and putting his own signature returned it: \"What propriety is there in\n\n1 Aurangzeb's pen was as much dreaded as his sword. As a writer of caustic and terse letters full of withering sarcasms, few Persian writers surpass Aurangzeb. He was in the habit of constantly writing D.O. letters to his officers, in order to keep them straight. The reader who wishes to have a taste of Aurangzeb's caustic sarcasm, might turn to the original Persian, as I am afraid I have not been able to convey its full relish in this English dressing. I quote the original Persian:\n\n\u0686\u0647\u0631\u0647 \u0632\u0639\u0641\u0631\u0627\u0646\u06cc\u060c \u067e\u0631\u0633\u0631 \u0648 \u062d\u0644\u0642\u0647 \u0627\u0631\u063a\u0648\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u062f\u0631 \u0628\u0648\u0633\u06cc \u0634\u0631\u06cc\u0641 \u062c\u0647\u0644 \u0648 \u0634\u0634 - \u0622\u0631\u06cc\u0646\n\n\u0628\u0631\u06cc\u0646 \u0631\u06cc\u0634 \u0648 \u0646\u0634 -\ncalling public oppression Sauda-i-Khas, and what connection has Sauda-i-Khas with Sauda-i-Am?\n\nThose who purchase\u2014sell;\nWe neither purchase nor sell.\"\n\nAnd by way of censure, to serve as a deterrent, the Emperor reduced the Prince's mansab by 500. The meanings of Sauda-i-Khas and Sauda-i-Am are as follows: \"All the goods which arrived on board the mercantile ships at the port of Chatgaon (Chittagong), &c., were bought up on behalf of the Prince, and were styled Sauda-i-Khas; afterwards those very goods were re-sold to the merchants of this country, when they were called Sauda-i-Am. When the news-letter containing the Emperor's signature came to be perused by the Prince, the latter abandoned the aforementioned trade. The Emperor Aurangzeb appointed Mirza Hadi to the office of Diwan of the Province of Bengal, after bestowing on him the title of K\u00e2r Talab Kh\u00e2n. The Mirza was a sagacious man, and an officer of honesty and integrity. He had already held the office of Diwan of the Subah of Orissa. In several Mahals pertaining to Orissa he had effected retrenchments in expenditure, and had thus become prominent amongst the Imperial officials. He was held matchless in probity and rectitude of purpose. Rendering eminent services, in periods of siege and war, he had got into the good graces of Emperor Aurangzeb. At that period, the reins of the administration of Financial and Revenue affairs, the power over the assessment and collection of revenue, and payments into and disbursements from the Imperial Treasury lay in the hands of the Diwan of the Subah. The Nazim had jurisdiction over the Procedure and Administration of Political affairs, such as the repression and chastisement of the refractory and the disobedient, and the extirpation of rebels and tyrants. Except with regard to the Jagirs attached to the Nizamat and personal Mansabs and presents, the Nazim had no power to\n\n1 The reader might note that there is a pun here on the word 'sauda,' which in Persian means both 'trade' and 'madness.'\n\n2 \"Azimu-ab-Sh\u00e2n was lazy and covetous. He was ready to concede anything for a sufficient bribe.\" In July 1698, for the sum of Rs. 16,000, the English were permitted by the Prince to purchase from the existing holders the right of renting the three villages of Calcutta, Sutanati, and Gobindpur. (See Wilson's Annals, Vol. I, p. 150).\nmeddle with the Imperial revenue. Both the Nazim and the Diwan were guided in the administration of the affairs of the Subah by a Procedure Code\\(^1\\) that was issued year after year by the Emperor, and they were not permitted to deviate from, or infringe, them by a hair-breadth. Kar Talab Khan, being appointed by Emperor to be Diwan of the Subah of Bengal, arrived at Jahangirnagar (Dacca). After waiting on the Prince, he devoted himself to the administration of the fiscal affairs. And the remittances into, and disbursements from, the Treasury being in charge of the above-mentioned Khan, the Prince's control over the income and expenditure ceased. The abovementioned Khan, finding that the country was without thorns, and fertile and rich, commenced re-assessment, and deputed sagacious and thrifty Collectors to every Parganah and Chakla and Sarkar. And after assessing accurately the Imperial revenue and sair taxes, he remitted one Kror of rupees to the Emperor, and prepared a complete Revenue-roll of the Khalsah mahals (crown lands) and of the Jagirs. In former times, owing to the badness of the climate of Bengal, the higher officers did not care to seek for service in this Province, as they fancied it not only fatal to human lives, but as actual haunts of demons. Therefore, the Chief Imperial Diwans, by way of inducement, conferred numerous Jagirs in Bengal on the Bengal Mansabdars. In consequence of this policy, very few Khalsah mahals were left in Bengal, so that the revenue of the mahals of this Subah did not suffice to meet either the pay of the soldiers under the Prince, or that of the naqdi troops. Therefore, their pay had to be provided for from revenues of other Subahs. The aforesaid Khan submitted a scheme to the Emperor suggesting allotment of lands in Orissa on account of Jagirs to the Bengal Mansabdars;\\(^2\\)\n\n---\n\n1 The Procedure Code or Manual, containing set rules and regulations on all revenue and administrative affairs, was called in Persian Dastur-ul-'Amal. It was issued to all Provincial Governors, Administrators, and officials after being personally approved by the Emperor himself, and every year modifications or additions were made to it with the Emperor's approval. No provincial Administrators, whether Nazims or Diwans, had authority to deviate from the set rules contained in the Dastur-ul-'Amal. Badaoni (Vol. I, pp. 384-385) states that in the time of Salim Shah, son of Sher Shah, the Dastur-ul-Amal was so comprehensive and explicit that even on Ecclesiastical matters (not to speak of Fiscal or Administrative matters), no reference to Qazis or Muftis was necessary.\n\n2 The Mansabdars were the higher officers under the Mughal Emperors;\nand this scheme met with the Emperor's approval. The Kh\u0101n thereon resumed all Jagirs in Bengal, together with their sair revenues, save and except such as pertained to the Nizamat and the Diw\u0101ni, and allotted in lieu thereof Jagirs to the Bengal mansabdars in Orissa, the soil whereof was comparatively worse, poorer, more sterile, and less fertile. By this ingenious stroke of policy, the Kh\u0101n effected a big surplus in the Bengal revenue to the credit of the Emperor, and squeezed out the profits from the Bengal Zamindars and Jagirdars. And by minute attention to details, he effected considerable retrenchments under the several Heads of the Public Expenditure. Year after year, he enhanced the Revenue-assessments of the \u0160ubah, and thus became the recipient of Imperial favours. When the Prince ('Azimu-sh-\u0160h\u0101n) found his control over the Bengal revenue diminished, he was constantly in a bad humour. Besides, the rewards which the Kh\u0101n received for his good services from the Emperor weighed as thorns of envy on the heart of the Prince, and kindled the fire of his jealousy. The Prince schemed to kill the Kh\u0101n, but failed in his aim. The Prince won over to his side the Commander of Nugdi troops\n\nthe term, however, was also used in the times of Sher \u0160h\u0101h. The leading Mansabdars were either Provincial Governors or Generals in the Army, whilst other Mansabdars held Jagirs. These Mansabdars sometimes held Mansab (or office) in one Province or \u0160ubah, and Jagir lands in another. (See Ain-i-Akbari, Vol. I, pp. 241-242, Blochmann's trans.)\n\n1 Revenue from land was called Khiraj. Jasiayah was capitation tax levied from non-Moslem subjects in exchange for protection afforded, at the rate of \"48 derhams for persons of condition, 24 derhams for those of the middle class, and 12 for the lowest class.\" Over and above the land-revenue, taxes on properties were called \"Tamgha.\" Imports on manufactures of respectable kinds were called Ji\u1e25at, and the remainder Sa'ir Ji\u1e25at. Sa'ir in its original purport, meant \"walking,\" 'moving,' or 'unstable,' and so came to denote all unstable sources of state revenue (barring land-revenue or Khiraj which was stable), such as customs, transit duties, market-tax. (See Vol. II, pp. 67 and 58 and p. 66, Ain-i-Akbari, for a list of Sa'ir taxes abolished by Emperor Akbar).\n\n2 Jagirs were conferred on Mansabdars for military service, and on others they were conferred without requiring military service. Before Mughal times the word \"Iqta\" corresponding to \"Jagir\" is frequently met with in the Tabaqat-i-Nasiri as well as in the Tarikh-i-Firuz \u0160ahi. But in histories of the Mughal period, the word 'Iqta' is seldom met with, and is replaced by the word Jagir. In Akbar's time, an officer called Diwan-i-Jagir or Superintendent of Jagirs was maintained. (See Ain, Vol. I, p. 261).\nnamed Abdul W\u0101hed and the Naqdi Contingent under the latter; by holding out promises of rewards and increase in pay. These naqdi troops were old Imperial servants. From pride of their strength and from confidence in their number, they did not truckle to the N\u0101zim or Diwan of Dacca, and much less to others. From their conceit of being dexterous swordsmen, they fancied others no match for themselves. For their nonchalance and bravado, they were widely known. These naqdi troops were incited to waylay the Kh\u0101n when opportunity might offer, under the pretext of demand of pay, and to kill him. This wicked Contingent at the instigation of the Prince were on the look-out for an opportunity to kill the Kh\u0101n. The Kh\u0101n adopting precautionary measures, always carried in his retinue an escort of armed troops, and never failed to be on the alert whilst going to and from the Darbar. One day, however, early of a morning, he rode out unattended to wait on the Prince. On the way, a corps of naqdis, under pretext of demanding pay, raised a tumult, and crowded in round the Kh\u0101n. The latter, displaying great nerve, faced them and drove them away. Ascertaining that the originator of this disturbance was the Prince, he in fury and rage proceeded to the latter. Discarding all official decorum, in an avenging mood, he placed his hand on his dagger, and sat knee to knee with the Prince, and added: \"This riot was due to your instigation, desist from this course, or else at this moment I will take your life and give mine.\" The Prince saw no way of escape, and from fear of the Emperor's resentment he trembled like the aspen. Summoning Abdul W\u0101hed with his corps, the Prince publicly forbade him from creating tumult and disturbance, and set about soothing the Kh\u0101n by display of courtesy and affability. The Kh\u0101n, being freed from anxiety arising from the hostility of his enemies, proceeded to the Diwan-i-Am, demanded the account of naqdi troops, levied their pay from Zam\u012bndars, and paying them off cashiered them. And he sent the Emperor an account of their meeting, embodying the same both in the\n\n1 These naqdi troops appear to be a class of Ahadi troops who received their pay in cash from the Imperial treasury, and were reckoned immediate servants of the Emperor. They constituted an Imperial Contingent of troops maintained in Provincial capitals, and were thoroughly independent of the local authorities, and were thus dignified by their independence. (See Ain-i-Akbari, Vol. I, pp. 249 and 231).\nCourt-Record as well as in the News-sheet. He also submitted to the Emperor a Proceeding signed by the leaders of the riot, together with his own Report. Fearing the ill-humour of the Prince, the Kh\u0101n resolved to keep himself aloof from the former, and to stay at a safe distance from him. After much deliberation and consultation, he fixed on the excellent site of Makhans\u0101bad, where news of all the four quarters of the Subah could be easily procurable, and which, like the pupil of the eye, was situate in the centre of the important places of the Subah. It had on the north-west the chakl\u0101h of Akbarnagar (Rajmahal) and the passes of Sakrigali and Tiliagadhi, the 'Key' to Bengal, on the south-west, Birbhum, Pachit and Bishanpur, the road to Jharkand, and the forests and hilly passes for the ingress and egress of free-booters and armies from the Dakhin and Hindust\u0101n, on the south-east, the chakl\u0101h of Bardwan, the road to Orissa, and Hughli and Hijli (ports for the arrival of ships of Christian and other traders), and the chakl\u0101hs of Jessore (Jessore) and Bh\u016bsn\u0101h, and on the east the chakl\u0101h of Jahangirnagar (Dacca), which then constituted the Viceregal Capital of this Subah, and to which pertained frontier outposts like those of Islam\u0101b\u0101d or Chittagong, and Silhat and Rang\u0101m\u0101ti, and on the north, the chakl\u0101hs of Ghor\u0101gh\u0101t and Rangpur and Kuch Behar. The above mentioned Kh\u0101n, without taking permission from the Prince, migrated to Makhans\u0101bad with the officers of Zamindars and Qan\u0101ngos and Revenue officials in charge of crown-lands, and settled down there. But when the news of the disturbance created by the naqdis reached the Emperor in the Dakhin through the\n\n1 The terms used are \"Waqiah\" and \"Sawanih.\" The Mughal Emperors maintained a Special Intelligence Department. In every Provincial capital and important centre, two special functionaries were maintained by the Mughal Emperors, one called \"Sawanih-navis,\" and the other \"Waqiah-navis.\" These were Imperial servants, quite independent of the local officials. The duties of both these functionaries were to daily record and send news to the Emperor of all that transpired in local centres, and as they worked independently of one another, the report of intelligence sent by one checked that of the other. The \"Waqiah-navis\" was an official Court-Recorder, whilst the \"Sawanih-navis\" was an official General Intelligence-giver. (See \u0100in-i-Akbar\u012b, Vol. I, pp. 258 and 259.) The object in keeping up these functionaries was that the Emperor at Delhi might \"be informed daily of all that transpired throughout his Empire, and also that active servants might work without fear, and negligent and forgetful men be held in check.\"\nmedium of News-letters and Court-records, and through the Report of Kar Talab Kh\u0101n containing denunciation of the Prince, an Imperial edict couched in threatening language was addressed to the Prince to the following effect: \"Kar Talab Kh\u0101n is an officer of the Emperor; in case a hair-breadth injury, in person or property, happens to him, I will avenge myself on you, my boy.\" And peremptory orders were also passed by the Emperor to the effect that the Prince should quit Bengal and withdraw to Behar.\n\nLeaving Sarbaland Kh\u0101n\u00b9 with Sultan Farukh-sir as his Deputy in Bengal, the Prince with Sultan Karimu-d-din, his household attendants and bodyguard set out from Jahangirnagar, and reached Mungir (Monghyr). Finding there the elegant white and black marble edifices\u00b2 built by Shah Shuja to be in a dilapidated condition, and seeing that a heavy outlay would be needed to set them in order, he did not like to fix his quarters there. And preferring the climate of Patna, which is on the bank of the river Ganges, the Prince fixed his quarters there. With the Emperor's sanction, he improved that city, named it 'Azimabad after himself, and built there a fort with a strong rampart. Kar Talab Kh\u0101n, at Makhsusabad, after the lapse of a year, prepared the Annual Abstract Accounts, and started for the Imperial Camp.\u00b3 And preparing the Revenue-Assessment papers, the Revenue-Roll, the estate Ledgers; and the Cash-Account of Receipts and Disbursements of the Subah, he desired Darab Narain, the Qan\u016bngo of the Subah of Bengal, to sign them. Taking advantage of the system then in force that the Accounts relating to the financial and internal administration of the country were not passed by the Imperial Central Diwan, unless they bore the signatures of Qan\u016bngos, that mischievous and shortsighted fool refused to sign the papers, unless his demand for three lacs of rupees on account of his fees as a Qan\u016bngo were satisfied. The Kh\u0101n under stress of necessity promised to\n\n\u00b9 Subsequently in 1709, this Sarbaland Kh\u0101n, whilst in temporary charge of Bengal, received a bribe of Rs. 45,000 from the English merchants, and granted them freedom of trade in Bengal, Behar, and Orissa. (See Wilson's Annals, Vol. I, p. 183).\n\n\u00b2 No trace of these ruined white and black marble edifices was found by me at Mungir (Monghyr) when I was there in the years 1893, 1894, or subsequently.\n\n\u00b3 Emperor Aurangzeb was at this time in the Dakhin busy warring against the Musalman Kingdoms of Golconda, Ahmadnagar and Bijapur, and\npay one *lak* of rupees on his return from the Emperor, but Darab Narain would not accept this arrangement, and withheld his signature. But Jinarain Qaningo, who was a Joint-Qaningo with Darab Narain, using foresight, signed the Accounts. Regardless of the hostility of the Prince, and regardless of the refusal of Darab Narain to sign the Account-papers, the Kh\u0101n started for the Imperial Camp, presented gifts and tributes of Bengal to the Emperor and to the Vizier and other Imperial Ministers, and also paid to the Emperor the Revenue-balances and profits of the Jagirs. And making over the Account-papers of the Subah to the Mastaufi and to the Diwan-i-\n\nalso against the Mahratta free-booters. Aurangzeb, with all his political sagacity, committed a grievous mistake of policy by supplanting these Musalman States, as these had hitherto effectually curbed Mahratta and other outside ambition, and kept in order all disturbing elements in the Dakhin. Their political effacement resulted in letting loose a number of Mahratta free-booters and other adventurers that had hitherto had no political existence, and hastened the growth of the Mahratta Confederacy that later on in a great measure, coupled with other forces, distracted the Great Mughal Empire. By use of a liberal and statesman-like policy, Aurangzeb might have federated those Musalman States in the South into Imperial feudatories, and thus converted them into strong and loyal bulwarks of the Mughal Empire. But fanaticism in this matter (see *Maasir-i-Alangiri*, which explains that this policy of repression was adopted by Aurangzeb, by reason of certain religious innovations that were in force in those States) fatally clouded the otherwise clear political vision of this Great Mughal Emperor, to the lasting detriment of the Indo-Moslem Commonwealth.\n\n1 The Qaningo \"was an officer in each district acquainted with its customs and land-tenures and whose appointment was usually hereditary. He received reports from the patwaris (land-stewards) of new cases of alluvion and diluvion, sales, leases, gifts of land,\" etc. (See *Ain-i-Akbari*, Vol. II; p. 47 n).\n\nOver the district Qanungos, there was a Provincial Qaningo as the text indicates. (See also p. 86, Vol. II, *Ain-i-Akbari*, which sets forth functions and emoluments of Patwaris, Qanungos, Shiqdar, Karkans, and Amins).\n\nIn the *Ain-i-Akbari* (Vol. II, p. 49) it is stated that it was the duty of the Betikchi or Accountant, \"at the year's end, when the time of revenue-collections had closed, to record the balances due, and deliver the record to the Collector, and forward a copy to the Royal Court.\" It would seem from the text the same duty in regard to the entire Subah had to be performed by the Provincial Diwan and the Provincial Qaningo.\n\n2 These important functionaries are frequently mentioned in the *Ain-i-Akbari*. Their function was to check, overhaul and audit important State\nKul, and proving his good and faithful services, the Kh\u0101n became the recipient of further Imperial favours, and was appointed by the Emperor Deputy to the Prince in the Nizamat of the \u1e62ubah of Bengal and Orissa, in addition to the office of Diwan. He was also given the title of Murshid Q\u016bli Kh\u0101n, and further received a valuable Khilat, with a standard and a kettle-drum. His man\u1e63ab was also raised.\n\nBESTOWAL OF THE NIZAMAT OF BENGAL ON NAWAB JAFAR KH\u0100N, AS DEPUTY TO PRINCE AZIMU-SH-SH\u0100N.\n\nWhen Murshid Q\u016bli Kh\u0101n being invested according to the former usage with the khilat of the offices of Deputy Nazim of Bengal Diw\u0101n of Bengal and Od\u012bsa (Orissa), reached the \u1e62ubah, he appointed Syed Akram Kh\u0101n to be his Deputy Diw\u0101n in Bengal, and Shujau-d-din Muhammad Kh\u0101n, his son-in-law, to be his Deputy Diw\u0101n in Od\u012bsa (Orissa). After his arrival at papers, such as Royal grants, payment-orders, sanads, farmans, state-accounts, etc., and then to sign and seal them. (See Ain-i-Akbari, Vol. I, pp. 262, 263, 264).\n\n1 The Diwan-i-Kul was the Central Imperial Diw\u0101n-in-Chief. It would appear the keen administrative genius of the Mughal Rulers of India evolved and organised a perfect system of Accounts as well as of Audit. Two independent systems of Account and Audit (each checking the other) were maintained. The patwaris kept one independent set of accounts, and the Bitikchis, (Accountants) another. The first submitted their accounts to local or district Qan\u016bngos, who submitted their Consolidated Accounts to the Provincial Qan\u016bngo. The second submitted their accounts to District Collectors as well as copies direct to the Royal Court; and the several District Collectors submitted their consolidated Accounts to the Provincial Diw\u0101n who collected them, and compared them with the Consolidated Accounts (independently prepared) in the hands of the Provincial Qan\u016bngos. Then both the Provincial Diw\u0101n and the Provincial Qan\u016bngo signed after comparison one General Detailed Consolidated Account together with an Abstract Account, and forwarded it to Court, where it was first audited by the Central Musta\u1e63fi and next audited by the Diwan-i-Kul (after reference to the set of accounts already received regularly in the Royal Courts from district Bitikchis or Accountants), and lastly approved and passed by the Emperor himself. Thus, few loop-holes were left for defalcations in accounts. (See the text, and the Ain-i-Akbari).\n\n2 Murshid Q\u016bli Kh\u0101n was son of a Brahmin and embraced Islam. Haji Shafi Ispahani purchased him, and named him Muhammad Hadi, treated him\nMakhsusabad, he improved that town, and named it after himself Murshidabad, and founded a mint there. And separating the ch\u0101khla of Midnapur from the \u0160ubah of Orissa (Orissa) he annexed it to Bengal. And imprisoning the defaulting zamindars of the \u0160ubah, and deputing experienced and honest Collectors of Revenue to their mahals, he attached the rents, and realised the outstanding Imperial revenues. And putting a complete stop to the authority of zamindars over the collection and disbursement of the Imperial Revenue, he limited their source of income to profits of N\u0101nkar tenures. And the \u2018Amils\u2019 (Collectors of revenue) under like a son, and took him to Persia. On Shafi\u2019s death, Muhammad Hadi came to the Dakhin, and entered the service of Haji Abdullah Khurassani, Diwan of \u0160ubah Berar. He subsequently entered Imperial service, and received the title of Kar Talab Kh\u0101n, and was employed in the Dakhin. He rose there to be Diwan of Haidarabad\u2014and then to be Diwan of Bengal (on the transfer of Ziaullah Kh\u0101n), with the title of Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n. Previous to this, he was Diwan of Orissa (Maasir-i-Alamgiri, p. 488), in the 48th year of Emperor Aurangzeb\u2019s reign. When Farrukh-sir ascended the throne, by payment of large sums as presents to the Emperor, he became \u0160ubadar of Bengal and received a Mansab of Haft hasari. His advancement is an eloquent testimony to the Islamic toleration (even under the much-abused Aurangzeb) that made no distinction between converts and born Musalmans in matters of official preferments. He died in 1138 A.H. at Murshidabad, which he had founded as the new Viceroyal capital of Bengal, in place of Dacca or Jahangirnagar. He was a good financier, an able accountant, and a strong and sagacious administrator. He built a dungeon full of filth, named it \u2018Baikant\u2019 or \u2018Paradise,\u2019 and confined in it zamindars who defaulted in payment of revenue. He re-surveyed and re-assessed Bengal, divided it into Chaklas, and prepared a new Perfect Revenue-Roll. [See Maasir-i-Alamgiri, p. 488, and Maasir-ul-Umara, p. 751, Vol. III (Pers. text)].\n\n1 A list of mint-towns in Hindustan in Akbar\u2019s time is given in the Ain-i-Akbari, Vol. I, p. 81. It appears that in Bengal, minting of gold coins was restricted to the Provincial capital (which in Akbar\u2019s time was partly Gaur and partly Tandah), and that minting of silver and copper coins took place in Bengal in Tandah.\n\n2 In Akbar\u2019s Rent-Roll, Midnapur is shown as a city with two forts (caste, Khandait) under Sarkar Jalesar of \u0160ubah Orissa. It continued to form a part of the Orissa \u0160ubah, until it was transferred from Orissa to Bengal by Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n.\n\n3 The term \u2018Nankars\u2019 is still prevalent in several parts of Bengal and Behar. \u201cNankars\u201d were \u201cservice-tenures,\u201d that is, \u201ctenures of land conferred free of revenue, in consideration of services tendered.\u201d In those days, the zamindars amongst other duties would appear to have performed police\nhis orders, sent Shiqdars and Amins to every village of the Parganahs, measured the cultivated and waste-lands, and leased them back to tenants, plot by plot, and advanced agricultural loans (Taqavi) to the poorer tenantry, and put forth exertions for increase in the produce of the lands. Thus in all the mahals Murshid Quli effected not only increase in revenue, but also increase in their areas.\n\nMurshid Quli prepared a perfect Revenue-Roll, collected the rents in kind, season by season, and also the land-revenue, sair taxes, and fees from agricultural lands. And effecting retrenchment in the Public Expenditure, he remitted revenue, double the former amount, into the Imperial Treasury. The zamindars of Birbhum\n\nduties, and were held responsible for maintenance of peace in their mahals\u2014the village chowkeedars or watchmen being directly under them. They were also in charge of village ferries, village ponds, and village roads in their mahals, and performed more or less the duties of \"justices of the peace.\" They were more or less quasi-official functionaries, and received sanads on appointment, and were liable to removal for gross misconduct. Their mahals were not liable to sanction-sale for arrears of revenue, but liable to attachment by the Crown for realisation of revenue, and defaulting zamindars were liable to punishment. They were quasi-state functionaries or quasi-official landed Aristocracy maintained by Musalman sovereigns for-State purposes. They were quite a different species from the Bengal zamindars of to-day. (See Alamgirnamah, Maasir-i-Alamgiri, Ain-i-Akbari and the text).\n\n1 As has been remarked before, Murshid Quli Khan was an able financier, and prepared a perfect actual Revenue-Roll of Bengal, after carefully resurveying lands in all the mahals in Bengal, and re-assessing them on the basis of increase in actual areas as ascertained by measurement, and of increase in the actual produce of the soil. He sent out for this purpose Amins (or Surveyors) together with Shiqdars (or Supervisors of revenue) to each village, under the immediate supervision of honest, experienced and capable Collectors of Revenue or 'Amils. He helped the poorer tenants with agricultural loans or advances (taqavi or tuccavi), and encouraged them to till their lands and improve agriculture. Murshid Quli Khan was no believer in Permanent Settlements. He preferred the Ryotwari Settlement system to the Farming system. Islamic Revenue systems recognise the soil as State property and allot a portion of its profit or produce to the actual tiller of the soil for his labour on it.\n\n\"A Shiqdar meant an 'officer appointed to collect revenue from a certain division of land under the Mughal Government.\"\n\nThe constitution of the Surveying party, their pay, their duties, with the process of measurement and testing in Mughal times, are set forth in the Ain-i-Akbari, Vol. II, p. 45, which shews that the measurement of lands and\nand Bishanpur, being protected by dense forests, mountains and hills, did not personally appear before the Nawab, but deputed instead their agents to carry on transactions on their behalf, and through them used to pay in the usual tributes, presents, and gifts. In consideration of the fact that Asadullah, zamindar of Birbhum, was a pious and saintly person and had bestowed half of his property as Madad-i-mash grants on learned, pious and saintly persons, and had fixed daily doles of charity for the poor and the indigent, the Kh\u0101n refrained from molesting him. He directed his attention, however, to the chastisement of the zamindar of Bishanpur, whose items of expenditure were heavy, and whose collections of rents from mahals were low. The Rajahs of Tipra, Kuch Behar, and Assam called themselves chetar dh\u0101ri and ruling chiefs, and did not bend their heads in submission to the Emperor of Hindustan, and minted coins after their own names. On hearing, however, of the vigorous administration of the Kh\u0101n, the Rajah of Assam presented to the Kh\u0101n chairs and palkis of ivory, musk, musical instruments, feathers, fans of peacock feathers, etc., and offered his submission. Similarly the Rajah of Kuch Behar offered presents and tribute to the Kh\u0101n. The abovementioned Kh\u0101n sent Khil\u0101ts for them; and this practice was observed year after year. The Kh\u0101n, having introduced order in the financial condition of the Mahals of Bengal, devoted his attention to the improvement of other administrative and internal affairs. His administration was so vigorous and successful that there was no foreign incursion nor internal disturbance, and consequently the military expenditure was nearly abolished. He kept up only 2,000 cavalry and 4,000 infantry, and with these he governed the Province. Through Nazir Ahmad, who was a peon, he used to collect the revenue of Bengal. And the Kh\u0101n was so powerful a personality and his commands were so overpowering, that his peons sufficed to keep peace in the country, and to overawe the refractory. And fear of his personality was so deeply impressed on the hearts of all, both the high and the low, that the courage of lion-hearted persons quailed in his presence. The Kh\u0101n did not allow petty zamindars access to his presence. And the mutsadis and \u2018amils and leading zamindars had not the heart to sit down.\n\nThe assessment of revenue were based on thoroughly scientific principles, quite analogous to the existing Settlement Procedure in India.\nin his presence; on the contrary, they remained standing breathless like statues. Hindu zamindars were forbidden to ride on palikis, but were permitted use of Jawalaha. The mutasadis, in his presence, did not ride on horseback; whilst the Mansabdars attended at State functions in their military uniforms. In his presence one could not salute another; and if anything opposed to etiquette occurred on the part of anyone, he was immediately censured. Every week he held court on two days to listen to complaints, and used to mete out justice to the complainants. Amongst his deeds of justice, it may be mentioned, that to avenge the wrong done to another, obeying the sacred Islamic law, he executed his own son. In administration of justice, in administration of the political affairs of the country, and in maintenance of the respect due to his Sovereign, he spared no one. And he reposed no confidence in the mutasadis, and used daily to inspect the collection and disbursement papers and the estate ledgers, and to sign them. At the close of each month, he used to seize all the agreements of Kh\u00e2lsah (crown lands) and Jagirs. Till the dues on account of those agreements were paid up into the Imperial Treasury, he caused mutasadis, 'amilis, zamin-dars, qanungos and other officers to remain in duress in the Diw\u00e2n Khana of the Chihel Sat\u00fbn Palace. Setting collecting peons to realise the dues, he did not allow the defaulters leave for eating or drinking or for answering calls of nature, and posted spies over the peons, so that none of the latter, owing to temptations of bribe, might supply a drop of water to the thirsty defaulters. Week after week they had to pass without food and drink, and at the same time he had them suspended, head downwards, to triangles off the ground, and had their feet rubbed against stones, and had them whipped; and in beating with sticks he shewed no quarter. And he converted to the Muhammadan religion the amlahs of zamindars with their wives and children, who, in spite of being scourged with\n\n1 In the text apparently, \"Aile\" has been by mistake dropped.\n\n2 Murshid Quli Khan's uprightness in administration of justice (regardless of all family ties of attachment) is remarkable. But his severity in ill-treating and torturing defaulting zamindars throws a shade on his otherwise bright personality.\n\n3 The only instances of forcible conversions of Hindus in Bengal to the Islamic religion, as would appear from these pages, were on the part of two\nsticks, failed to pay up the State revenue-collections that they had misappropriated. Amongst these, Andinarain, zamindar of the Chaklah of Rajshahi, who was the descendant of a Hindustani, and who was both capable and efficient, held charge of the revenue-collections of the Khalsah (crown lands). With him were in league Ghul\u0101m Muhammad and Kalia Jamadar with two hundred troopers. Andinarain demurred to the payment of the demand, and prepared to fight. Murshid Quli Khan sent his officer, Muhammad Jan, with a force to chastise him. Close to Rajbari, the contending forces approached each other, and a battle ensued. Ghul\u0101m Muhammad Jamadar was killed, whilst Andinarain from fear of Murshid Quli Khan's anger slew himself, and his zamindari was transferred to two Bengal zamindars on the northern side of the Ganges, named Ram-Jivan and Kali Kunwar, who were punctual in payments of revenue. When that year came to a close, and the new year commenced, in the month of Farwardi (corresponding to Asar) weighing the treasures Murshid Quli remitted to the Emperor one kror and three laks of rupees on account of the Imperial revenue, loading the same on two hundred waggons.\n\nnon-Moslems, that is, by Hindus themselves who had embraced the Islamic religion, namely (1) by Jado aiias King Jallal-ud-din, son of Rajah Kans and (2) by Murshid Quli Khan, who was himself the son of a Brahmin. I fail to come across in Bengal history any instance of forcible conversion of Hindus in Bengal to the Islamic religion, on the part of any born Musalman ruler or king. Proselytes and converts, under all systems of the world's religions, are generally more zealous and bigoted than those born and brought up within their pale. The general insinuation, therefore, against Musalman sovereigns and rulers of Bengal that they forcibly converted the Hindus to the Islamic religion, seems to be as unfounded as ungenerous. No doubt, the superior moral influence of Musalman saints, like Nur Qutb Alim and others, naturally told on Hindu society (disorganised and demoralised by the caste-systems of the later days, and aborn of the old Vedantic purity) and induced portions of its ranks to flock spontaneously to the Moslem creed, with its simpler doctrine of Monotheism.\n\n1 Probably, Rajbari on the E.B. Railway, near the Goalundo station.\n2 This Ram-Jivan, I believe was the founder of the present Natore Rajhouse. I do not know of which family Kali Kunwar was the founder.\n3 In the Ain-i-Akbari (Vol. II, p. 49), it is explained under the term 'Fotadar' or the 'Treasurer,' that the term fota (not, potah) is applied in Arabic to cloths used as waist wrappers. A poddar meant 'a banker, a cashkeeper, or an officer in public establishments for weighing money or bullion.'\nconveyed by six hundred cavalry and five hundred infantry. Over and above this amount, he remitted the profits derived from Jajirs, together with other fees. And also at the beginning of each year he sent to the Emperor elephants, Tangan horses, buffaloes, domesticated deers, and game dressed specially at Jahangirnagar (Dacca), wolf-leather shields, sitai pati mats mounted in gold, and mosquito curtains made of Ganga jali cloth of Sylhet, through which serpents could not penetrate, together with other rarities, such as ivory, musk, musical instruments, and European manufactures and presents received from Christians, &c. At the time of sending the remittance, he used to accompany it on horseback together with his staff up to the Suburbs of the City, and used to have the fact recorded in the Court-Record as well as in the News-sheet. And the procedure for despatch of remittances was the following. When the waggons, loaded with treasure, passed into the limits of another Sub\u0101b, the Subadar of that place sending his own men had the waggons of treasure brought into his fort, and relieving the waggons and their escorts reloaded the treasure into fresh waggons, convoyed by fresh escorts furnished by himself. And the same procedure was adopted by succeeding Subadars, till the treasures with the presents reached the Emperor Aurangzeb. And when the Kh\u0101n's efficient administration met with the approbation of the Emperor, the former received fresh favours from the Emperor, who raised his rank and bestowed on him the title of Moatamanu-l-Mulk'Alan-d-daulah Ja'far Khan Nasiri Na\u1e63ir Jang. He was also rewarded with the personal Mansab of a Haft Hazuri together with the Insignia of the Mahi Order, and was raised to a higher class of the Peerage. No appointments to offices in Bengal were made without his advice. And Imperial Mansabdars hearing that the country of Bengal had been turned into a fertile garden without thorns, sought for offices in Bengal. Nawab Jafar Khan appointed the applicants to offices under him.\n\nTherefore would seem to mean 'weighing the coins' or 'testing and counting them,' or \"putting them in cloth bags.\"\n\nHere we get a glimpse of some of the old industries and arts of Bengal.\n\nGangajal was a kind of cotton-stuff manufactured in Bengal in the times of the Mughals. See Ain-i-Akbari, Vol. I, p. 94 (Blochmann's trans.)\nof these was Nawab Saif Khan whose application for appointment being received through the Emperor, Nawab Jafar Khan conferred an office on him. A short account of Saif Khan's career is mentioned in the body of this History. Nawab Saif Khan was alive till the period of the Nizamat of Nawab Mahabat Jang. As he was the scion of a very noble family, he never visited Nawab Mahabat Jang. Although the latter sought for an interview, Nawab Saif Khan did not visit him. Whenever Nawab Mahabat Jang whilst out on a hunting excursion went towards Purneah, Nawab Saif Khan advanced with his troops and blocked his progress. But whenever Nawab Mahabat Jang had need of auxiliaries, Saif Khan furnished efficient contingents. After Saif Khan's death, his son, the Khan Bahadur, succeeded to the office of Faujdar of the tract of Purneah and its environs. Nawab Mahabat Jang gave in marriage the daughter of Nawab Said Ahmad Khan Bahadur Saulat Jang, his nephew, to the Khan Bahadur, but that lady died four days after the wedding. On account of this, confiscating the treasures and effects of the Khan Bahadur, Nawab Mahabat Jang kept the latter under surveillance. The Khan Bahadur of necessity was obliged to mount a horse and escape to Shah Jahannabad (Delhi). Nawab Mahabat Jang bestowed the tract of Purneah on Saulat Jang. The latter proceeding there with a large force, devoted himself to its administration, and held sway. After Saulat Jang's death, his son, Shankat Jang, succeeded him. Nawab Siraju-d-daulah, who was the latter's cousin, during the period of his Nizamat, killed Shankat Jang in battle, and deputing Diwan Mohan Lal, confiscated Shankat's treasures and effects.\n\nWhat was I saying? and to what have I digressed?\nWhere lay the horse? and where have I galloped away?\n\nI now return to my story. Nawab Jafar Khan was seeking\n\n1 He received the office of Faujdar of Purneah, held the rank of a Haft khatari; and was a son of 'Umdatu-l-mulk Amir Khan, Subadar of Kabul. See Seir, Vol. II, p. 574.\n\n2 'Mahabat Jang' was a title of Nawab Ali Vardi Khan; his actual name was Mirza Muhammad Ali. See Seirul Mutakherin, Vol. II, p. 470 Pers. text.\n\n3 In Seirul Mutakherin, Vol. II, p. 552, the name of Saif Khan's son is mentioned as Fakhruddin Husain Khan.\nan opportunity to avenge himself on Darab Narain Qanungo; who, during the Nawab's incumbency of the office of Diw\u0101n, had declined to sign the accounts. Inasmuch as the office of Qanungo corresponded to the office of Registrar of the Conquered dominions, and the Diw\u0101n's Statements of Account and Revenue-roll without the Qanungo's signature were not accepted by the Central Imperial Diw\u0101n, the Nawab sought for an opportunity to tarnish Darab Narain's reputation, by doubling the sphere of Darab Narain's authority over the affairs of administration. With this object in view, the Nawab entrusted to him control over the affairs of the Khalsah (crown lands). And when Diw\u0101n Bhupat Rai, who had come with the Nawab from the Imperial Camp, died, and his son, Gulab Rai, could not satisfactorily discharge the duties of the office of Diw\u0101n, the office of Peeshkar of the Khalsah was also bestowed on Darab Narain. And leaving to his control the Assessment and Collection of the revenue and other Financial and Internal affairs, the Nawab made him supreme. Although the abovementioned Qanungo by minute attention to details raised the Revenue of the Khalsah (crown lands) to one kror and fifty lakhs, made Revenue Collections, and under every Head of Income shewed considerable increase, and presented a Budget with a larger Surplus of Imperial Revenue than before, still the Nawab, gradually wresting authority from him, imprisoned him together with the Statements of Accounts and Estate-ledgers, and employing various tortures killed him. And he allotted ten annas of the Qanungo-ship to D\u0101r\u0101b Narain's son, Sheo Narain, and six annas thereof to Jai Narain, who at the period of the Nawab's Diw\u0101ni, when the Nawab was setting out for the Imperial Camp, had shewn good-will, and had signed the Nawab's Statements of Accounts. And dismissing Zian-d-din Kh\u0101n, Fanjdar of Hughli,1 he with the Emperor's sanction brought the Fanjdari of that Port under his immediate autho-\n\n---\n\n1 The office of Fanjdar of Hughli was hitherto directly under the Emperor, and was independent of the Subadar of Bengal. Murshid Quli Khan succeeded in reducing the Fanjdar of Hughli to the position of his own immediate subordinate. For Murshid Quli's relations with the English merchants, see Wilson's Annals, Vol. I, pp. 301, 299, 298, 297, 290, 268. The English merchants secured a great patron in Zian-d-din, who was appointed by Shah Alam in 1710 to be Fanjdar of Hughli and Admiral of all the seaports on the coast of Coromandel. See Wilson's Annals, Vol. I, pp. 185 and\nvity as an appendage to the Nizamat, and appointed Wali Beg on his own authority as Faujdar of that place. The above-mentioned Kh\u0101n, on the arrival of Wali Beg, relinquishing the fort, came out of the town to set out for the Imperial Capital. Wali Beg summoned to himself Kankar Sen Bengali, who was Peshkar of the dismissed Faujdar, for submission of papers relating to receipts of revenue and the office-records, together with the clerks and subordinate officers of the office of Faujdar. Ziau-d-din Kh\u0101n turned to Kanker Sen\u2019s assistance; and thereon Wali Beg opposed the Kh\u0101n\u2019s march. In consequence, between Ziau-d-din Kh\u0101n and Wali Beg a quarrel ensued. The above-mentioned Kh\u0101n with his army, on the field of Chandanagar (Chandenagore) between Chinsurah and French Chandanagar, with the help of the Christian Dutch and French, constructed redoubts, and prepared to fight. Wali Beg also on the field of the \u2018Idg\u0101h,\u2019 on the bank of the tank of Debi D\u0101s, to a distance of one and a half kroh, drew up his forces, constructed entrenchments, and transmitted an account of the state of affairs to Nawab J\u0101far Kh\u0101n. And both the quondam and the new Faujdars were busy fighting from behind their respective entrenchments, and reviewing their forces. Mulla Jarsam J\u016brani, Deputy of Ziau-d-din Kh\u0101n, and Kankar Sen, secretly obtaining help of guns, gunpowder, and armaments from the Dutch and French, advanced to the battle-field, and assumed the offensive. Wali Beg, waiting for auxiliaries, assumed the defensive. At this juncture, Dalip Singh Hazari with a force of cavalry and infantry came from Nawab J\u0101far Kh\u0101n to the assistance of Wali Beg, and also brought a mandate containing threats addressed to the Christians. Ziau-d-din Kh\u0101n, on the advice of the Christians, opened negotiations of peace with Dalip Singh, and put him off his guard. Early in the morning, sending by way of a ruse a false message to Dalip Singh through an agent, Ziau-d-din Kh\u0101n instructed the latter to hand the message to Dalip Singh and to get back the reply, and placing one red shawl for recognition on the head of the agent despatched the latter on\n\n332, 329, 341.

And an English gunner whose aim was unerring directed a large bronze\\(^1\\) gun (the range whereof extended over one and a half \\textit{bok}) towards Dalip Singh's camp, and by means of a telescope kept in view the agent's shawl. Arriving at a time when Dalip Singh was bareheaded and barebodied and was engaged in rubbing oil in order to bathe, the agent handed the message to Dalip Singh. Then the gunner directing his aim at the shawl fired his gun, and the cannon-ball hit Dalip Singh on the chest and scattered his body to the air. Praise is due to that unerring magician, for no harm ensued to the agent.

After his death, Kankar Bengali, who was the root of all this disturbance, and had his residence at Hugli, returning from the Imperial Capital, arrived in Murshid\u0101b\u0101d, and fearlessly waited on Nawab J\u0101far Kh\u0101n, and with the left hand saluted the latter, wishing to convey that with the hand that he had saluted the Emperor, to salute J\u0101far Kh\u0101n would be profane. Nawab J\u0101far Kh\u0101n retorted by saying: \"Kankar is under the shoe.\" And Kankar\\(^2\\) with \\textit{fatah} on both the \\(\\omega\\) and the \\textit{sak\u016bn} of the \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\omega\\), in Hindustani means \"a gravel.\" Nawab Jafar Kh\u0101n, feigning forgetfulness of\n\n\\(^1\\) It would appear the French, Dutch, and English were all backing up the dismissed Faujdar Ziau-d-din Kh\u0101n against the new Faujdar, Wali Beg. See Wilson's \\textit{Annals}, Vol. II, pp. 66, 72, 75, 79, 81, 83. The skirmishes between Ziau-d-din Kh\u0101n and Wali Beg occurred in 1712 A.C.\n\n\\(^2\\) \"Kankar,\" means a \"pebble,\" \"a gravel\" or a \"brick-bat.\" Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n was punning on the Hindu Naib's name of 'Kankar.' So, it would seem that Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n, the stern iron-man, could now and then unbend himself and receive humourous flashes.\nKankar's past and present misconduct, and outwardly shewing reconciliation, appointed him to the office of Chakladar of Hughli. At the close of the year, at the time of auditing the Annual Abstract Accounts, the Nawab put him in prison on charges of misappropriation of the current and arrear revenue collections and sair duties, and put this cat into breeches, and forced him to swallow some laxative, and set on him a harsh collector of revenue. In the breeches continually easing himself, Kankar died. At that time Syed Akram Khan who held the office of Diwan of Bengal died, and Syed Razi Khan, husband of Nafisa Khanam, a daughter of Shujan-d-din Muhammad Khan, (Nawab Nasim of the Shah of Orissa and son-in-law of Nawab Ja'far Khan,) who was the scion of a leading Syed family of Arabia, was appointed Diwan of Bengal. And he\\(^1\\) was a bigoted and short-tempered man, and in collection of dues was extremely strict, and by adopting harsh measures collected the revenue. It is said he prepared a Reservoir full of filth, and as in the language of the Hindus Paradise is called 'Baikant,' he sneeringly named this Reservoir \"Baikant.\" He used to thrust into this Reservoir the defaulting Zamindars and defaulting Collectors of Revenue. After torturing them in various ways, and making them undergo various privations, he used to collect in entirety the arrears. In that year, news of the insurrection of Sitaram Zamindar, and of the murder of Mir Abu Turab, Faujdar of the Chakladar of Bhusnah, in the Sarkar of Mahmudabad, was received. The details of this affair are as follows:\u2014Sitaram,\\(^2\\) zamindar of Parganah Mahmudabad, being sheltered by forests and rivers, had placed the hat of\n\n---\n\n1 The text is ambiguous. This sentence refers probably to Murshid Quli Khan.\n\n2 Sitaram had his residence at Muhammadpur or Mahmudpur, at the junction of the Barasia and Madhumati rivers, in Jessore district. See Westland's History of Jessore. Muhammadpur is now a police circle. Ruins of his tanks still exist there. Bhosna lies near Bonnaldiah (formerly in Jessore, now in Faridpur district), an old Musalman colony, on the Chandana river. Ruins of a fort lie at Bhosna. Close to Muhammadpur or Mahmudpur, lies an old Musalman colony at Shirgaon, on the Barasia river. See also Wilson's Annals, Vol. II, pp. 166, 167, 168. Sitaram was 'executed for murder and rebellion' by Murshid Quli's order. Sitaram's family and children who had taken refuge in Calcutta, were in 1713 surrendered by the English to Mir Nasir, Faujdar of Hughli, for being made over to Murshid Quli Khan.\nrevolt on the head of vanity. Not submitting to the Viceroy, he declined to meet the Imperial officers, and closed against the latter all the avenues of access to his tract. He pillaged and raided the lands adjoining to his Zamindari, and also quarrelled with the Imperial garrisons and Faujdars. Mir Abu Turab, Faujdar of the Chaklak of Bhushnah, who was the scion of a leading Syed clan and was closely related to Prince Azimu-sh-shan and the Timuride Emperors, and who amongst his contemporaries and peers was renowned for his learning and ability, looked down upon Nawab Jafar Khan. Mir Abu Turab tried to capture Sitaram, but was not successful. At length, he detailed his General, Pir Khan, with 200 cavalry to chastise Sitaram. On being apprised of this, Sitaram concentrating his forces lay in ambush to attack the aforesaid General. One day, Mir Abu Turab with a number of friends and followers went out for hunting, and in the heat of the chase alighted on Sitaram's frontiers. Pir Khan was not in Abu Turab's company. The zamindar (Sitaram) on hearing of this, fancying Mir Abu Turab to be Pir Khan, suddenly issued out from the forest with his forces and attacked Mir Abu Turab from the rear. Although the latter with a loud voice announced his name, Sitaram not heeding it inflicted wounds on Abu Turab with bamboo-clubs, and felled him from his horse. When this news reached Nawab Jafar Khan, his body trembled from fear of the Emperor's resentment. Appointing Hasan Ali Khan who had married Nawab Jafar Khan's wife's sister and was descended from a noble family to be Faujdar of Bhushnah, and supporting him with an efficient force, Nawab Jafar Khan directed him to capture that troublesome villain (Sitaram). The Nawab issued mandates to the Zamindars of the environs insisting on their not suffering Sitaram to escape across their frontiers, and also threatening that should the latter effect his escape across the frontiers of any one, not only he would be ousted from his Zamindari, but be punished. The Zamindars from all sides hemmed him in, when Hasan Ali Khan arrived and captured Sitaram together with his women and\n\n1 It was formerly in the Jessore district, but is now included in the more modern district of Faridpur. Close to Bhushnah, on the banks of the Chanda-na river, lie several other ancient colonies of Syeds or Mirs, such as those at Baumalidh and Dakhinbari, etc.\nchildren, confederates and adherents, and sent them with chains round their necks and hands to Nawab Jafar Khan. The Nawab enclosing Sitaram's face in cow-hide had him drawn to the gallows in the eastern suburbs of Murshidabad on the high-way leading to Jahangirnagar and Mahmudabad, and imprisoned for life Sitaram's women and children and companions. Bestowing his Zamindari on Ram Jiwan, the Nawab confiscated to the State Sitaram's treasures and effects, and extirpating his family, root and branch, he sent an account of the affair to the Emperor. As the Emperor Aurangzeb Alamgir had died in the Dakhin on Friday, 28th of Zilqad 1119 A.H., Muhammad Muazzam Shah Alim Bahadur Shah ascended the Imperial throne of Delhi. Nawab Jafar Khan sent presents with the tribute of Bengal, and received an Imperial Patent confirming him in the Viceroyalty of Bengal. The Nawab was also honoured with the gift of a Khilat including a fringed palanquin. Prince Azimu-sh-Shan, leaving Sar-bland Khan as his Deputy at Azimabad, set out for the Imperial Capital. And that very year Sultan Farrukh-sir, prior to the accession of Bahadur Shah, came to Murshidabad from Jahangirnagar (Dacca) at the invitation of Nawab Jafar Khan, and put up at the Lai Bagh palace. The above-mentioned Nawab, paying proper deference to the princely rank of his guest, rendered him due services, and defrayed the expenses of the Prince and his household; whilst according to the established practice he remitted the Revenue with the tribute to the Emperor Bahadur Shah. After a reign of five years and one month, in the year 1124 A.H., Emperor Bahadur Shah died, and his eldest son, Sultan Mazu-d-din, under the title of Jahandar Shah, became Emperor, and in concert with his two younger brothers\n\n1 Emperor Aurangzeb died in the 52nd year of his reign, at the age of ninety-one, in 1118 A.H. or 1707 A.C. at Ahmadnagar, and was buried at Aurangabad. See Seir Vol. II, p. 375, and Khafi Khan. He left the following sons:\u2014Muhammad Muazzam (at Kabul), 2, Muhammad Azam (at Malwa) 3, Kam Bakhsh (at Bijapur.)\n\n2 Muhammad Muazzam alias Shah 'Alam the eldest son became Emperor in 1707 with the title of Bahadur Shah, after defeating and killing his two brothers. He died in 1712.\u2014See Seir, Vol. II, pp. 378-379, and history of Khafi Khan.\n\n3 The great Timuride House was at this time torn asunder by factions and was badly served by venal ministers and officers. The Syed brothers\nkilled Prince 'Azimu-sh-Sh\u0101h.' After removing the causes of anxiety, and with the exertions and help of Asad Kh\u0101n the Prime Minister and Amiru-l-Umar\u0101 Z\u016b-l-fuq\u0101r Kh\u0101n, the new Emperor killed his other two brothers. Indeed, after B\u0101h\u0101dur Sh\u0101h's death, within the space of eight days, he killed almost every one of the Imperial scions numbering more than thirty persons, and after torture and imprisonment of those who escaped the sword, Jahandar Sh\u0101h mounted the throne. He appointed the 'Am\u012br\u016b-l-Umar\u0101 who was Pay-Master-General of the Army to the office of Grand Vizir and Am\u012br\u016b-l-Umar\u0101's father 'Asafu-d-danl\u0101h 'Asad Kh\u0101n to the office of Vakil-i-Kul or Supreme Regent of the Empire. According to the established practice, the new Emperors sent message of confirmation to Nawab J\u0101far Kh\u0101n. The aforesaid Kh\u0101n, shewing submission, remitted presents and tribute to the Emperor.\n\nIn order to assert his claim to the Imperial throne, Sult\u0101n Farrukh-sir, the second son of Prince 'Azimu-sh-Sh\u0101h, who resided in the Province of Bengal as Deputy Nazim of the Subah resolved to fight with Sult\u0101n M\u0101zu-d-din, planned to start for Sh\u0101hjahan\u0101-b\u0101d (Delhi), and demanded money and troops from Nawab J\u0101far Kh\u0101n. The latter gave the following straightforward answer: \"I as an Imperial servant am subject to the Crown and Throne of the Sovereign of the Imperial Capital. To submit to any one save and except the person who descended from the Timuride House sits on the Throne of the Empire of Delhi, would be an act of treachery. Since M\u0101zu-d-din, your uncle, is in possession of the Crown and the Throne, the Imperial revenue cannot be paid to you.\" Despairing of obtaining the treasures and troops of Bengal, but remembering the injunction in the Qoran \"I put my trust in my Lord God,\" Farrukh-sir took heart, and marched out with a small force of old and new comrades who were in his company, on an\n\nwere heads of one faction, and their ascendancy and their selfish policy are fully related in the Seir-ul-Mutakherin.\n\n1 See Seir and Irvine's Later Mughals, J.A.S. for 1896.\n2 i.e., Jahan Sh\u0101h and Rafiush Sh\u0101h.\n3 Farrukh-sir's mother, Saheb-un-Nissa, was a brave and resourceful lady, and when Farrukh-sir contemplated flight across the sea, she inspired her son with a noble ideal by addressing him thus: \"If thy flight must needs be across the sea, let it be the sea not of waters but of blood.\" Encouraged by his noble mother's inspiration, Farrukh-sir at length defeated Jahandar Sh\u0101h, at the end of 1712, and became Emperor.\nexpedition against Sult\u0101n M'azu-d-din. Summoning his own army and artillery from Jah\u0101ng\u012brnagar, Farrukh-sir set out for Sh\u0101hjahan\u0101b\u0101d, and by the time he arrived at 'Azim\u0101b\u0101d (Patna) a large army collected under him. Levying money in the way of tax from the bankers of that town, he reduced the Subah of Behar to his subjection. Collecting paraphernalia of royalty, he mounted the throne, and unfurling the Imperial Umbrella he whirled it over his head. Raising the standard of march from Patna with Royal pomp and splendour, he cast the shadow of peace and tranquillity on the residents of Banaras. And raising a loan of one kror of rupees on the security of the Empire from N\u0101gar Set and other leading bankers of Banares, he raised a levy of efficient troops. Syed Abdull\u0101h Kh\u0101n and Syed Hussain Ali Kh\u0101n, the two Syed brothers of Barh\u0101, who were Nazims of the Sub\u0101hs of Oudh and Allahabad and were matchless in courage and heroism had been dismissed by Sult\u0101n M'azu-d-din, and consequently were smarting under a sense of wrong. They, therefore, espoused the cause of Sult\u0101n Farrukh-sir, and tied the girdle of devotion and self-sacrifice to the waists of their hearts. And intercepting the treasure from Bengal remitted by Nawab J\u0101far Kh\u0101n, which owing to the revolution in government Shuj\u0101n-d-din M\u016bhamm\u0101d Kh\u0101n, Darogha of Allahabad (unyoking the bullocks in the garden of the town) guarded with 300 troops, Farrukh-sir detailed a large force to guard it. Having satisfied himself about the security of the treasure and the efficiency of the force which he had detached to guard it, Farrukh-sir bestowed the office of Viz\u0101r\u0101t on Syed Husain Ali Kh\u0101n, and had the Khutbah of sovereignty recited after his own name. \"When God wills a thing, the conditions for its accomplishment are also provided.\" As Farrukh-sir was displeased with J\u0101far Kh\u0101n, he appointed Rashid Kh\u0101n, elder brother of Afrasiab Kh\u0101n Mirzai-Ajmiri, who was the scion of an ancient and noble family of Bengal and was brought up in the Imperial household, and who in physical prowess was equal to a Rustam or an Isfandiar, and who used to hurl down rogue elephants\u2014to supersede J\u0101far Kh\u0101n in the Sub\u0101hd\u0101ri of Bengal. It is said that when Sult\u0101n Farrukh-sir set out from Akbarnagar (Rajmahal) towards 'Azim\u0101b\u0101d\n\n1 See S\u016br, Vol. II, p. 381.\n2 See Wilson's Annals, Vol. II, p. 90. This was in 1712.\n(Patna), the cannon of Malik Maidan\\(^1\\) which required a maund weight of cannon-ball and 150 bullocks and two elephants to move it, was stuck in the mud in a hollow ditch near Sakrigali. Although an attempt was made to drag it out with the help of bullocks and elephants, it could not be moved. Farrukh-sir himself going up to the cannon brought into requisition the ingenuity of Christian gunners, but even that was of no avail. Mirz\u0101-i-Ajmiri making his obeisance, said: \u201cIf ordered, thy slave might try his strength.\u201d The Sult\u0101n gave permission. Mirz\u0101-i-Ajmiri, tying the hem of his garment round his waist and putting both of his hands beneath the cannon-frame, lifted up the cannon together with its frame on his chest, and said \u201cwherever ordered, I will put it.\u201d The Sult\u0101n ordered it to be placed on a high ground. The Mirz\u0101 removed the cannon from the ditch to a high ground. From the strain of his physical power, drops of blood were about to ooze out from his eyes. The Sult\u0101n applauded him whilst the assembly, sent up shouts of praise and choruses of applause to the skies.\n\nThe Mirz\u0101 at that very moment was rewarded with the mans\u0101b of a S\u012bh haz\u0101r\u012b together with the title of Afrasi\u0101b Kh\u0101n. Rashid Kh\u0101n set out with a large army for Bengal, and entered it via the passes of Tiliagadhi and Sakrigali. On hearing the news of his entry, J\u0101far Kh\u0101n shewed no signs of anxiety. Besides the regular war-establishment of the \u0160ubah he mobilised no extra troops. Rashid Kh\u0101n reaching three kroh distant from Murshid\u0101bd arrayed his troops for battle. Next morning, Naw\u0101b J\u0101far Kh\u0101n detailed Mir Bangali and Syed Anwar Jaunpuri with two thousand cavalry and infantry to encounter Rashid Kh\u0101n, whilst the Nawab himself, according to his daily practice, set to copying the Qur\u0101n. When the two forces encountered each other, a battle ensued. Syed Anwar, in the thick of the fight, was killed, but Mir Bangali, with a small force, bravely stood his ground on the battle-field, till the army of Rashid Kh\u0101n surrounded him from all sides. Although these tidings reached Nawab J\u0101far Kh\u0101n, the latter remained unconcerned and quietly went on with his work of copying the Qur\u0101n. At last the news of Mir Bangali\u2019s retreat arrived. It was then that the Nawab detached his special disciple, Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n, who was Faujdar of Murshidabad and\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) He was apparently a Turk, as the title Malik would indicate, but I cannot trace who this notable was.\nan Officer of the Army, to reinforce Mir Bangali. The former with the swiftness of lightning and breeze joined Mir Bangali; and threw in the auxiliaries. Subsequently, Nawab Jafar Kh\u0101n, after having finished his work of copying the Qur\u0101n, recited the Fatiha-i-Khair and armed himself for battle. And mounting an elephant, with a force of cavalry and a retinue consisting of kinsmen and Turkish, Georgian and Abyssinian servants he encountered Rashid Kh\u0101n on the field of Karim\u0101b\u0101d outside the City, and commenced chanting the Dua-i-Saifi. It is said that he had so persistently practised the Dua-i-Saifi, that when he commenced chanting it his sword of itself unsheathed itself from its scabbard, and through invisible help he vanquished the enemy. On the arrival of Jafar Kh\u0101n, the courage and boldness of Mir Bangali and his army increased ten-fold and hundred-fold. With his clamorous force Mir Bangali attacked the centre of the enemy. Rashid Kh\u0101n, who considered Jafar Kh\u0101n no match for himself, swaggering of swordsmanship and his capacity to easily rout the enemy, mounted a rogue elephant, and charged Mir Bangali who was in the van. The aforesaid Mir who was an unerring marksman\n\nPlaced a wooden arrow in his bow-string,\nAnd stretched his bow, and extended his arm-pit.\nWhen the arrow-notch came up to his ear,\nHe shot the arrow straight at the struggling enemy.\nAs luck would have it, the arrow hit the enemy on the forehead,\nAnd pierced right through the hind-head.\nThat leader of the heroes was pierced by the arrow:\nThat brave lion rolled on the elephant.\nAt that juncture, the troops forming a solid column,\nMade one united rush at the enemy:\nThe ground was trodden down into furrows by horses' hoofs,\nThe sky was cut to pieces by cannon and spears.\nWith swords, daggers, iron-maces and spears,\nThey charged the enemy.\n\n\u2020 This dua or prayer, meaning literally the \"prayer of the sword\" is said to have been uttered by the Prophet at the battle of Badr, when it is related angels descended to fight in his ranks, and turned disaster into victory.\nOwing to profuse shedding of blood on that battle-field,\nThe whole face of the earth looked crimson.\nA whole world was consigned to destruction,\nIf any one survived, he was imprisoned.\nThe enemy's treasures and effects were looted,\nJafar Khan won a glorious victory.\n\nNawab Jafar Khan returning triumphant caused the music of\nvictory to be struck up, entered the Fort, and ordered that a\nminaret should be raised entombing the heads of the slain on the\nhighway leading towards Hindustan, so that it might serve as\na warning to others. The prisoners of Rashid Khan's army said\nthat on the advance of Jafar Khan green-dressed soldiers with\ndrawn swords descended from the clouds, attacked the force of\nRashid Khan, and afterwards vanished. Sultan Farrukh-sir who\nhad not yet finished settling his accounts with Sultan M'azu-d-\ndin, on the way receiving news of Jafar Khan's victory and\nRashid Khan's defeat was depressed. In short, when near Akbar\u0101-\nb\u0101d (Agra) a battle ensued between Farrukh-sir and Sultan M'azu-d-\ndin Jah\u0101nd\u0101r Sh\u0101h, the Syeds of Barha, on the side of Mu\u1e25am-\nmad Farrukh-sir, displaying self-sacrifice, exhibited heroic valour.\nOn the side of M'azu-d-din, Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n Bah\u0101dur Kokaltash\nKh\u0101n, who was the Pay-Master General of the Army, was killed,\nowing to the carelessness of the Amir-ul-Umara Zu-l-fuq\u0101r Kh\u0101n.\nAnd M'azu-d-din's other noblemen, especially the Mughal noblemen,\nbeing in conspiracy with the noblemen of Farrukh-sir, exhibited\ntreachery during the battle. In consequence, great confusion\narose in the army of M'azu-d-din Jah\u0101nd\u0101r Sh\u0101h. Becoming\ndepressed by observing the fate of Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n Bah\u0101dur, Jah\u0101nd\u0101r\n\n1 See description of the battle in December 1712 in Seir-ul-Mutakherin,\nVol. II, p. 392.\n2 The Syed brothers of Barha were Syed Hussain Ali Kh\u0101n, Nasim of the\nSubah of Patna and Syed Abdullah Kh\u0101n, Nasim of the Subah of Allahabad.\nThe Seir-ul-Mutakherin (Vol. II, pp. 387, 388, 391, 392), gives a detailed account\nas to how these Syed brothers helped Farrukh-sir in the war of succession.\nThese Syed brothers subsequently fell out with Farrukh-sir, and imprisoned\nhim and had him killed (Seir, Vol. II, p. 419). For a life of Syed Hussain Ali\nKh\u0101n, see Maasir-ul-Umara, Vol. I, p. 321.\n3 He was a son of Asad Kh\u0101n, the Prime Minister of Aurangzeb. His name\nwas Mu\u1e25ammad Ismail, and his titles were ' Zu-l-fuq\u0101r Kh\u0101n Amir-ul-Umara\nNa\u1e63rat Jang.' See Massir-ul-Umara, p. 93, Vol. II, for his life.\nShah fled straight to Shahjahanabad to the house of 'Asad Khan Aqifuddaulah,' the Chief Minister of the Empire. Immediately after, Amiru-l-Umar\u0101, son of Aqifuddaulah, presented himself before his father, and counselled the latter to shelter the Emperor. The father, not considering it expedient to throw in his lot with Jahandar Shah, kept the latter under surveillance. Then Sultan Muhammad Farrukh-sir, without encountering any further opposition, ascended the Imperial throne at Akbarabad (Agra), towards the end of the year 1124 A.H. From Akbarabad (Agra), Farrukh-sir swiftly marched to Shahjahanabad (Delhi), where he slew Jahandar Shah and the Amiru-l-Umar\u0101.\n\nACCESSION OF SULTAN FARRUKH-SIR TO THE THRONE OF DELHI.\n\nOn hearing of the accession of Emperor Farrukh-sir, Nawab Jafar Khan sent presents and tribute, and remitted the entire balance of the Imperial revenue. In return, the Nawab received patents confirming him in the united offices of the Nizamat and Dewani of the three Subahs of Bengal, Behar, and Orissa. The Nawab was also recipient of a rich Khilat. The Nawab's representations to the new Emperor continued to receive attentive consideration, as during former regimes. The Nawab became an object of envy to his contemporaries and peers. For instance, on Jafar Khan's representation to the Emperor, Nagar Set's uncle\n\n1 His name was Muhammad Ibrahim, and his titles were Aqifuddaulah Jumlatul-Mulk Asad Khan. He was related by marriage to Eminuddaulah Asaf Khan, and became Prime Minister under Emperor Aurangzeb. (See his life in Maseer-ul-Umara, Vol. I, p. 310, and in Seir, Vol. II, p. 406.) He was a statesman of eminence and sagacity. On his son, Zulfuqar Khan's assassination, he composed the following pathetic epitaph:\n\n\u0647\u0644\u0641 \u0634\u0627\u0645 \u063a\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0628\u0627 \u062f\u0648 \u062c\u0634\u0645 \u062e\u0632\u0646\u0634\u0627\u0646\n\u06af\u0641\u062a \u0628\u0631\u0627\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0633\u0645\u064a\u0644 \u0631\u0627 \u0642\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0641\u06cc\u0631\u0648\u0632\n\n2 See Seir-ul-Mutakherin, Vol. II, p. 395 (Pers. text). The corpse of Jahandar Shah was placed on an elephant, and the corpse of Zulfuqar Khan was tied to its tail.\n\n3 This was a very unwise departure from the old Mughal policy of keeping the two offices distinct, in that it encouraged later on the growth of disloyal intrigues against the Central Authority in Delhi.\nand agent, Fateh Chand Sahu, whose services had won the good graces of the Kh\u0101n, was invested with the title of Jagat Set, and appointed to the office of Treasurer-General of Bengal. Syed Hasain \u2018Ali Kh\u0101n, the Paymaster-General, who was a brother of Qutb-ul-Mulk \u2018Abdull\u0101h Kh\u0101n Vazir, aspired after the title of Nasirjang, which title Jafar Kh\u0101n held. As it was not consonant with the Imperial regulations that two persons should simultaneously hold one title, an Imperial mandate was issued to Jafar Kh\u0101n, suggesting an exchange of titles. Although the Syed brothers were personages of immense influence and power, Jafar Kh\u0101n resented their impudence, declined to exchange his title, and sent the following manly reply to the Emperor: \u201cThis old servant has no hankering after names or titles; but the title which it pleased the late Emperor \u2018Alamgir (Aurangzeb) to confer on him, he declines to barter.\u201d When Syed Razi Kh\u0101n died, at the desire of Jafar Kh\u0101n, Emperor Farrukh-sir conferred the Diw\u0101ni of the Subah of Bengal on Mirza Asadu-l-l\u0101h, son of Shuja\u2018u-d-din Muhammad Kh\u0101n, Nazim of Orissa, by the daughter of Jafar Kh\u0101n, bestowing at the same time on the Mirz\u0101 the title of Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n. As Jafar Kh\u0101n had no son, and Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n was his maternal grandson, shewing foresight, he purchased from the income of his personal jag\u012br the zamind\u0101ri of Qismat Chunabkhali in Parganah Kholhabbah in the district of Murshid\u0101b\u0101d from Mu\u1e25ammad Am\u0101n, the Taluqd\u0101r of the aforesaid Qismat, in the name of Mirz\u0101 Asadu-l-l\u0101h Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n, named the said zamindari Asadnagar, and caused it to be entered in the Imperial and Provincial Q\u0101nungeo\u2019s registers. This estate came to be known as Kh\u0101\u1e63 Talaq, so that after his death it might afford subsistence to his descendants, and after the payment of revenue from its income its surplus might be at their disposal. And in the same year, the Deputy Governorship of Jah\u0101ngirnagar (Dacca) was bestowed on Mirz\u0101 Lu\u1e6dfu-l-l\u0101h, a son-in-law of Shuja\u2018u-d-din Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n. The Mirz\u0101 at the same time received the title of Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n. In that on the 9th Rabiu-l-\u1e62ani 1131 A.H. the Emperor Farrukh-sir was slain,\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Between Farrukh-sir and the Syed brothers, ill-feeling broke out through the instigation of one Mir Jumla (who possessed great influence over Farrukh-sir, having been Qazi of Dacca, when Farrukh-sir was there as Deputy Nazim). This ill-feeling was fanned by Ratan Ghand, the crafty Diwan of the Vazir Qutb-ul-Mulk Syed Abdullah, brother of Syed Hussain Ali Kh\u0101n. This ill-feeling which not only paralysed the Administration,\nthrough the treachery of 'Abdull\u00e2h Kh\u00e2n the Vizir and Husain 'Ali Kh\u00e2n, the Paymaster-General, the Syeds of Barha raised Sultan Rafi'u-d-daraj\u00e2t, son of Prince Rafi'u-sh-sh\u00e2n, son of Bah\u00e2dur Sh\u00e2h, to the throne. For four or five months, ruling nominally, this Emperor died of consumption. After this, Rafi'u-d-daraj\u00e2t's second brother, named Sultan Rafi'u-d-daul\u00e2h, was brought out from captivity, and placed on the throne, and was styled Sh\u00e2h Jah\u00e2n the Second. The latter also, like his elder brother, for five or six months sat nominally on the throne. At the time when the Imperial army was engaged in repelling Sultan Neko Sir, son of Sultan Akbar, and grandson of Emperor Alamgir, who had invaded Akbar\u00e2b\u00e2d (Agra), Sh\u00e2h Jah\u00e2n the Second also died. And the Syeds of Barha and other Imperial noblemen, at the end of the year 1131 A.H., bringing out Sultan Raushan Akhtar, son of Jah\u00e2n Sh\u00e2h, from the citadel of Shahjah\u00e2nb\u00e2d (Delhi), and marching with him day and night, reached Akbar\u00e2b\u00e2d (Agra), and in the beginning of 1132 A.H. they placed him on the Imperial throne, and styled him Abu-l-Fatt\u00e2h Na\u015firu-d-din Muhammad Sh\u00e2h Ghazi. A poet has said:\n\n\"\u0648\u0634\u0646 \u0627\u062e\u062a\u0631\u0628\u0631\u062f - \u0627\u06a9\u0646\u0648\u0646 \u0645\u0627\u0647 \u0634\u0647\n\u06cc\u0648\u0633\u0641 \u0627\u0632 \u0632\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0631\u0622\u0645\u062f \u0634\u0627\u0647 \u0634\u0647\n\n\"He was a bright star, now he has waxed into a moon,\nJoseph has returned from captivity, and has become a king.\"\n\nNaw\u00e2b Jafar Kh\u00e2n, hearing of the accession of Muhammad Sh\u00e2h to the Imperial throne, sent presents and tribute, and received but undermined for ever the prestige of the old illustrious Timuride House is detailed in the Seir-ul-Mutakherin, Vol. II, pp. 407, 409, 415, 416, 418, 419, and 420. The Syed brothers, to the detriment of the State and to their own lasting dishonour, made the Imperial Mughal throne of Delhi, at this time, a football for their own selfish aims and personal ambitions. (See extracts from Khafi Kh\u00e2n's history at p. 420, Vol II, Seir).\n\n1 In Seir-ul-Mutakherin, Vol. II, p. 419, it is related the Syed brothers raised to the throne Shamsu-d-din Abul Barkat Rafi'u-d-daraj\u00e2t, son of Rafiu-l-Qadr, and grandson of Bahadur Sh\u00e2h, at the age of twenty, in 1131 A.H.\n\n2 See Seir-ul-Mutakherin, Vol. II, p. 421. The ambitious Syed brothers now virtually ruled over the Mughal Empire in India.\n\n3 See Seir, Vol. II, pp. 422, 423. At this time Ratan Chand was the evil genius of Q\u00e2tb-ul-Mulk Syed Abdullah the Vazir, and had the impudence of nominating persons to even the Qas\u00eesh\u00eeps, for which he was once snubbed by his master.\nin return patents confirming him in his former offices, and adding thereto the Subahdari of Orissa. In short, owing to the undue influence exercised over the administration by Syeds Husain 'Ali Khan and 'Abdu-l-l\u00e2h Kh\u00e2n from the reign of Farrukh-sir till that period, the affairs of the Empire had suffered much in consequence, and owing to constant changes in Emperors, the administration of the country had fallen into chaos. The people of Bengal were, however, free from the troubles incidental to revolutions in the kingly office, as Jafar Khan ruled over that Province with great vigour. In his time no harm ensued to Bengal at the hands of the Mahvattas. The Christian Danes who had no factory in Bengal, and carried on commercial transactions through the agency of the French, with the advice of the latter, offering nazar, applied for permission to erect a factory at Bangib\u00e2s\u00e2r. Obtaining sanad from Naw\u00e2b Jafar Khan, they erected mud-walled houses, established themselves there, and laid the foundation of a factory with strong towers, surrounded by a deep and broad moat, into which the river water flowed, and wherein sloops could move about. Working day and night, and spending much money, they set about building the same. Placing obliquely the cap of vanity on the head of pride, they gave themselves airs at the expense of other Christian nationalities, and bragged they would sell woollen-stuffs, velvet, and silk-stuffs at the rate of gunny-cloth. The English and Dutch Christians, seeing the loss in their own markets,\n\n1 This place is marked between Ichapur and Chank, on the map in Wilson's Annals, Vol. I, p. 130.\n\n2 It is a silk-stuff with figures of leaves and branches woven on it.\n\nThe Ain-i-Akbari (Blochmann's tr., pp. 92\u201496) gives a list of the gold-stuffs, cotton-fabrics, and woollen-stuffs current in India in Akbar's time. It would appear therefrom that out of 28 gold-stuffs only two were imported from Europe, out of 39 silk-stuffs only seven were imported from Europe, out of 29 cotton-stuffs nil was imported from Europe; whilst out of 26 woollen-stuffs only one was imported from Europe, all the rest being either manufactured in India, or imported from Asiatic countries, like Arabia, Persia, China, &c.\n\n3 Richardson's Dictionary does not seem to give the word \u0645\u06cc\u0644\u06cc, but it occurs in the following charming lines of the great Persian poet, Omar Khayyam:\n\n\u062f\u064e\u0631\u0650\u0634\u064e\u0645\u0652 \u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0651\u0642\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e \u0686\u0650\u0647 \u0632\u0650\u06cc\u064e\u0627 \u0686\u0650\u0647 \u0634\u0650\u062a\u0652\n\u0645\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0632\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0647\u0650 \u0639\u064e\u0627\u0634\u064e\u0642\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e \u0686\u0650\u0647 \u062f\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0632\u064e\u062e\u064e \u0686\u0650\u0647 \u0628\u0650\u0647\u064e\u0634\u0652\nconspired to have the former's factory closed, intrigued with the Mughal merchants, and undertook to pay themselves their nasars. Relating to Ahsanu-l-lah Khan, Faujdar of the Port of Hooghly, tales of their bloodshed and oppression in Europe and also exaggerated accounts of their having erected forts and towers with moats at Bangibazar, and of their past misdeeds in the Emperor's dominions, they induced Ahsanu-l-lah Khan to write to Nawab Jafar Khan, and themselves petitioned the latter to issue mandates in the name of the above Faujdar to close the factory of the Danes. Although Ahsanu-l-lah Khan sent agents to close the factory, the Danes not relying on their message, failed to close their factory; at length the Faujdar deputed his own Deputy, named Mir Jafar, to the Danes. The Chief of the Danes, who was styled a General, mounted cannons on the heights of the ramparts, and prepared to fight. The aforesaid Mir, erecting entrenchments facing the ramparts, commenced fighting with cannons, rockets, arrows, and muskets. But the soldiers of the Mir could not approach the factory, owing to constant shower of cannon-balls and rockets. And the ways for the ingress and egress of the vessels of merchants in the river became closed. The Christian French secretly leagued with the Danes and assisted the latter with supplies of shot, powder, and armaments. The Danes captured, with the secret help of the French, Khwajah Mohammad Kamil, eldest son of Khwajah Mohammad Fazal, who happened to pass and repass the river by boat. Owing to this, all the Mughal, Armenian, and other merchants made great exertions to effect his release, and fearing lest he might be slain, for two or three days a truce was arranged. The aforesaid Khwajah, agreeing to pay a large ransom, and also promising to bring about peace, was released from the custody of the Danes. Then the Christian French, dreading the resentment of the Faujdar, deserted the Danes. Mir Jafar, advancing his entrenchments, with volleys of cannon-balls, rockets, arrows, and musket-balls, reduced the garrison to straits, and cut off all supplies both by land and by water. When the garrison were reduced to starvation, their Indian servants all fled, and the General alone with thirteen Danes remained in the factory. Though reduced to such straits and numbers,\nthey with their own hands kept up a perpetual shower of cannon-balls and rockets, and allowed no opportunity to the attacking force to lift up their heads, and far less to advance out of their entrenchments or to assault the factory. For some time the fighting continued in this wise. By chance, a cannon-ball discharged from Mir Jafar's entrenchment hit the Danish General on the right arm, and broke it, and his hand became in consequence useless. The General\\(^1\\) was obliged, in consequence, at dead of night, to scuttle out of the factory, and, embarking on board a vessel, he set sail for his own native country. Next morning, the factory was captured; but save and except some cannon-balls, nothing of value was found. Mir Jafar, raising the gateway and the tower of the factory, returned victorious and triumphant. About that time, news arrived that the Afghans, Shuj\u0101'\u012bt Kh\u0101n and Nij\u0101t Kh\u0101n, zamindars of Tonki Sar\u016bbp\u016br,\\(^2\\) in the Sarkar of Mahm\u016bd\u0101b\u0101d, who were notorious for their lawlessness, had plundered the revenue of Mahm\u016bd\u0101b\u0101d amounting to sixty thousand rupees, whilst on its way to Murshid\u0101b\u0101d. Naw\u0101b Jafar Kh\u0101n, who thirsted for the blood of thieves and robbers, hearing this news, appointed a Superintendent of Dacoity with spies under him, and after ascertaining the reality and origin of this affair, he issued an order to Ahs\u0101nu-l-l\u0101h Kh\u0101n, Fanjd\u0101r of the Chakl\u0101h of Hughli, directing their arrest. The aforesaid Kh\u0101n, ostensibly marching out on a hunting expedition, like a sudden calamity, surprised their stronghold, arrested and captured all the brigands, put them in chains and fetters, mutilated their hands and feet, tied them strongly and securely with pieces of stirrup-leather, and sent them to Naw\u0101b Jafar Kh\u0101n. The Naw\u0101b imprisoned them for life, and confiscated their treasures. After they were thus banished and extirpated,\\(^3\\) the Naw\u0101b settled their aforesaid zam\u012bnd\u0101r\u012b with R\u0101m Jivan. Levying indemnity equal to the plundered revenue from the landholders of the neighbourhood, the Naw\u0101b credited it to the Imperial treasury. During the Naw\u0101b's administration, the names of free-booters, night-marauders, and assassins were blotted out from the annals of the Bengal Satrapy, and the dwellers, both of\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The Danish Chief's name appears to be Mr. Attrup (See Wilson's Annals, Vol. II, p. 200). This happened in 1714.\n\n\\(^2\\) This is a place about five miles from Jessore head-quarters.\n\n\\(^3\\) There is still a Pathan family in Sarubpur, though impoverished.\ntowns and villages, lived in perfect peace and comfort. The Thanahs of Katwah and Murshidganj, on the highway leading to Bardw\u0101n, were established by the Naw\u0101b, in the early part of his Niz\u0101mat, whilst he held the title of Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n. He established these Thanahs for guarding the above highway, and their control and administration was entrusted by the Naw\u0101b to his special disciple, Muhammad J\u0101n. In that, in the environs of Fanachor, which is on the highway leading from Nadi\u0101 to Hughli, in the plantain groves thefts took place in broad daylight, Muhammad J\u0101n established an outpost at P\u016bpthal, subordinate to the Thanah of Katwah. Capturing the thieves and robbers, and chopping them into bits, Muhammad J\u0101n hanged them on the trees of the highway, to serve as warnings to others. As in his retinue, hatchet-men used to go ahead, he became known as Muhammad J\u0101n Kolhar\u0101h. Thieves and robbers used to tremble on hearing of his name. As a propagator of Muhammadan religion, as a strict observer of the religious injunctions, as a friend of scions of good family, as a reliever of the distressed, and as an exterminator of oppressors, Naw\u0101b Jafar Kh\u0101n was a second Amira-l-Umar\u0101 Sh\u0101ista Kh\u0101n. He was strict in the enforcement of his orders, and faithful in the fulfilment of his engagements. He never neglected saying his daily prayers five times, and fasted for three months in the year, and used to completely recite the Qor\u0101n. On the 12th and 13th of the lunar months, he used to fast, and on Thursday nights he was vigilant in his prayers. Many nights he used to pass in reciting certain select portions of the Qor\u0101n, and he slept little. From morning to midday, he devoted himself daily to transcribing the Qor\u0101n. And he used to send, every year, copies of the Qor\u0101n transcribed by his hand, together with votive offerings and gifts, through the headmen of the pilgrims and other caravans bound for pilgrimage, to Mecca, Medinah, Najaf, Karballa, Baghd\u0101d, Khor\u0101s\u0101n, Jid\u0101h, Ba\u1e63rah, and other holy places, like Ajmir, Panduah, &c. For each of these places, he allotted votive offerings, endowments, and reciters of the Qor\u0101n. The humble author of this History has seen a torn copy of the Qor\u0101n, every chapter of which was detached, in the shrine of Hazrat Makhdum Akhi Siraju-d-din, at S'adu-l-lahpur, written in large characters in the handwriting\n\n1 I do not know if that copy is still there. See also note ante.\nof Naw\u00e2b Jafar Kh\u00e2n. The Naw\u00e2b had in his employ 2,500 reciters of the Qor\u00e2'n, who completely recited the Qor\u00e2'n daily, and corrected what the Naw\u00e2b transcribed from the Qor\u00e2'n; and their meals were supplied twice daily from the Naw\u00e2b's own kitchen, and comprised game, birds, and other animals. He shewed a great predilection for the company of Syeds, Shaikhs, the scholarly, and the pious, and he deemed it meritorious to serve them. And from the 1st to the 12th of the month of Rabi'u-l-Awwal, which is the anniversary of the death of the Prophet Muhammed (Peace be on him!), daily he used to feed the excellent and the venerable Shaikhs, the Ulama, the pious saints, and inviting them from the environs of Murshidabad, he used to receive them with great respect at his banquets, and till they finished their dinners, he used to stand before them in a respectful posture, and to serve them. And every night during that period, from Mahinagar to L\u00e2lb\u00e2gh, on the banks of the river, he used to arrange illuminations with chir\u00e2ghs, in an elegant fashion, so that from the brightness of the illumination, the altars of the mosques and the pulpits, with the inscriptions of the Qor\u00e2'n engraved thereon, could be read from the other side of the river by spectators, to their great amazement. It is said that he employed more than one lak of labourers to light the chir\u00e2ghs under the supervision of Naz\u00eer Ahmad. After sunset, as soon as the gun was fired to signal that the illumination should commence, all the chir\u00e2ghs were simultaneously lit up in one instant, producing an illusion as if a sheet of light had been unrolled, or as if the earth had become a sky studded with stars. And he constantly consecrated his life to seek the approbation of his Creator and to seek the well-being of his subjects, and to redress the grievances of the oppressed. He used to sign his name with the Sh\u00e2ngar\u00ee pen. He exerted himself to render the prices of food-grains cheap, and did not allow rich people to hoard up stocks of grains. Every week, he had the price-current reports of food-grains prepared, and compared them with the prices actually paid by the poor people. If these latter were charged one d\u00e2m over the prices stated in the price-current reports, he had the dealers, mahald\u00e2rs, and weighmen punished in various forms, and had them patrolled through the city, placed upon asses. During his administration, the ruling price of rice was 5 or 6 maunds (of the standard market\nweight) per rupee, and other articles were similarly cheap, so much so that by spending one rupee in a month, people ate polao and qatia daily. Owing to this cheapness, the poor lived in ease and comfort. And the captains of ships were not permitted to export on their vessels food-grains beyond those needed for actual consumption by those on board the ships. At the period of disembarkation of ships, the Faqdar of the port of Hughli deputed to the harbour a Preventive Officer for the inspection and attachment of the food-grains, in order that no food-grains beyond what were needed for actual consumption on board the ships might be exported. And the Nawab had so much reverence for the Imperial authority, that he never travelled on any of the Imperial flotilla of boats. In the rainy seasons; when the Imperial war-vessels came for review from Jahangirnagar (Dacca) he used to go up to receive them, and turning his face towards the Imperial Capital he used to offer his salute and presents. And in obedience of the Sacred Law he never indulged in intoxicating liquors, and eschewed things prohibited by the sacred law, neither he saw dancings nor heard singinga. In his whole lifetime, besides his one wedded wife, he kept no mistress, and never bestowed his attention on any other woman. Owing to his extremely nice sense of honour, he did not allow eunuchs and women who cannot be lawfully seen to enter his harem. If a female slave went out of his harem once, he did not allow her access to the harem again. In every branch of learning, art, and science he had great proficiency. He abstained from delicious and luxurious dishes; nor did he taste anything of luxury except ice-water and ice-preserves.\n\nAnd Khizr Khan, Deputy of Nazir Muhammad, was deputed for four months in winter to the mountains of Akbarnagar for storing ice. The Nawab had stores of ice full for twelve months, used ice daily and received his supplies of ice from Akbarnagar. Similarly, in the season of mango-fruit, which is the best of the fruits of Bengal, the Superintendent of mango-supplies was posted in the\n\n1 This would indicate wonderful economic and agricultural prosperity in Bengal during the Viceroyalty of Mur Shid Quli Khan. Polao and Qatia are rich Hindustani dishes. See Ain-i-Akbari (Bloch's Tr., Vol. I, pp. 59 and 62) for a list of Hindustani menu, and also for statistics of prices of certain articles in Akbar's time.\n\n2 For a detailed description of the Fruiter in India, in Akbar's time, see Ain-i-Akbari (Bloch's Tr., p. 64.)\nChaklah of Akbarnagar; and he, counting the mangoes of the Kh\u0101s trees, entered them in the accounts, and shewed their collection and disposal, and the watchmen and carriers, levying the expenses of carriage from the zamindars, sent the sweet and delicious mangoes from Mald\u0101h, Katw\u0101h, \u1e24usainpur, Akbarnagar, and other places. And the zamind\u0101rs had no power to cut down the Kh\u0101s mango-trees; on the contrary, the mangoes of all the gardens of the aforesaid Chaklah were attached. And this practice was more rigorously observed in the times of previous N\u0101zims of Bengal. Even at present, when the administration of Bengal is virtually in the hands of the Christian English, and only the nominal Ni\u1e93\u0101mat rests with Naw\u0101b Mub\u0101raku-d-daulah, son of Naw\u0101b J\u0101far Ali Kh\u0101n, in the mango-season the Superintendent of the Kh\u0101s mangoes proceeds to Mald\u0101h on behalf of the aforesaid Naw\u0101b Mub\u0101raku-d-daulah, attaches the mangoes of the Kh\u0101s trees, and sends them to the Naw\u0101b, and the zamind\u0101rs do not go near the Kh\u0101s mango-trees. But the Superintendent no longer obtains the carriage expense from the Zamindars, nor does he enjoy his former prestige and respect. The roots of oppression were so thoroughly extirpated in the time of Naw\u0101b J\u0101far Kh\u0101n, that the agents of zamindars used to loiter about\u2014from the Naq\u0101r Kh\u0101nah to the Q\u0101h\u0113l Satun\u2014in quest of the oppressed and of complainants. Wherever they came across an oppressed man or a complainant, they amicably settled matters with him, and did not leave him to complain to the Naw\u0101b. And if the officers of the Courts of justice shewed partiality towards the oppressors, and if the oppressed carried their complaints to the Naw\u0101b, the latter instantly re-dressed their grievances. In administering justice, he did not allow consideration and partiality to be shown to anyone; he weighed the high and the low evenly in the scale of justice. For instance, it is well known that to avenge the death of an oppressed man, he executed his own son, and obtained the title of \"\u0100d\u0101lat G\u0101st\u0101r\" (or Justice-Strewer). He used to dispense justice, basing his orders\n\n1 i.e., when this history was written (1788.)\n2 i.e., Mir Ja\u015bar Ali Khan.\n3 The Q\u0101h\u0113l Satun was a Public Audience Hall built by Murshid Quli Khan, at Murshidabad.\n4 This incident of stern and blind justice recalls to memory the glorious career of another Musalman sovereign in the far West\u2014that is, of Abdur Rahm\u0101n, the Khalifa of Spain. (See Amir Ali's History of the Saracens, p. 510.)\non the injunction of the Qor\u0101n, and on the expounding of the law by Q\u0101zi Muhammad Sh\u0101rf, who had been appointed to the office of Q\u0101zi by Emperor Aurangzeb, and who was an upright judge and a great scholar, free from hypocrisy. It is related that a mendicant at Chun\u0101khali begged for alms from Bindraban, the Talqadar. The latter got annoyed, and turned him out from his house. The mendicant on his (Bindraban's) route of passage collected some bricks, laid them one over the other like the foundation of a wall, and named it a mosque, and shouted out the call to prayer, and whenever the palanquin of Bindraban passed that way, he shouted out still more loudly the call to prayer. Bindraban, becoming annoyed by this, threw down some brickbats from that foundation, and abusing the mendicant drove the latter from that place. The mendicant lodged a complaint at the Court of justice of Naw\u0101b J'afar Kh\u0101n. Q\u0101zi Muhammad Sharf, with the concurrence of other Ulama, acting on the injunction of the sacred Law, ordered the execution of Bindraban. J'afar Kh\u0101n, not acquiescing in the sentence of execution, enquired thus from the Q\u0101zi as to whether he could be let off: 'Can in any way this Hindu be saved from the death-sentence?' The Q\u0101zi replied: \"Only so much interval may be allowed in the execution of his death-sentence as may be taken up in the execution of his interceder; after that, he must be executed.\" Prince 'Azimu-sh-sh\u0101h also interceded for Bindr\u0101ban; but that, too, was of no avail. The Q\u0101zi killed him by shooting him with an arrow with his own hand. Azimu-sh-sh\u0101h wrote to Emperor Aurangzeb as follows: \"Q\u0101zi Muhammad Sh\u0101rf has turned mad; for nothing he has killed Bindr\u0101ban with his own hand.\" The Emperor remarked on the report of the Prince thus: \"This is a gross calumny; the Q\u0101zi is on\n\n1 A wonderfully upright and fearless Judge Qazi Muhammad Sharf must have been.\n\n2 Mark the pun on the word \"Asim\" in the text. \"Asim\" means 'great' as well as it may refer to the name 'Azimu-sh-sh\u0101h'. So it may mean \"it is a great or gross calumny\" and also \"it is a calumny on the part of Azim (Azimu-sh-sh\u0101h).\" Aurangzeb, even whilst angry, was not free from flashes of wit (often sarcastic wit) in his epistles. As I am afraid, in this English garb, the reader may miss the relish of the original, I give the original in Aurangzeb's language:\n\n\u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0628\u0647\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0639\u0638\u064a\u0645 - \u0642\u0627\u0636\u064a \u062e\u062f\u0627 \u0643\u064a \u0637\u0631\u0641\nthe side of God.\" Till the close of the reign of Emperor Aurangzeb, Q\u0101zi Sharf continued to hold the office of Q\u0101zi. On the death of the Emperor, the Q\u0101zi resigned his office; though J'afar Kh\u0101n pressed him to continue, he did not. And during the reign of Emperor Aurangzeb and during the Niz\u0101mat of J'afar Kh\u0101n, only the nobility, the scholars, the learned, and the excellent who passed examinations were appointed to the office of Q\u0101zi, which was never bestowed on the illiterate or the low. No changes or transfers in the offices of the pious and hereditary Q\u0101zis existed, nor was any tax levied from them; in fact, they were subordinates to no superiors, nor answerable to any. For instance, Ahsanu-l-l\u0101h Kh\u0101n, Fa\u1e63\u012bd\u0101r of the port of Hughli, grandson of B\u0101q\u012br Kh\u0101n, the Senior (after whom a kind of Indian bread has acquired the name of B\u0101q\u012br Kh\u0101ni), was a proteg\u00e8 of Naw\u0101b J'afar Kh\u0101n, and he possessed great influence with the Naw\u0101b. During his administration, Imamu-d-din, Kotw\u0101l (Police Superintendent) of the port of Hughli, who had acquired a high position and much influence, enticed away the daughter of a Mughal from the latter's house. The aforesaid Ahsanu-l-l\u0101h Kh\u0101n, conniving at this offence, showed partiality towards his Kotw\u0101l, and stood surety for his future good behaviour. The Mughals carried their complaint to Naw\u0101b J'afar Kh\u0101n. The Naw\u0101b, according to the injunctions of the Holy Book, had the Kotw\u0101l stoned to death, and did not listen to the intercession of Ahsanu-l-l\u0101h Kh\u0101n for the offender. Towards the close of his career, on the eastern plain of the city of Murshid\u0101b\u0101d, on the grounds of his Khas T'aluq, the Naw\u0101b erected a Treasury, a Katrah, a Cathedral mosque, a monument, a Reservoir, and also sank a large well, and under the staircase of the mosque, he located his own tomb, so that it might be safe from damage, and might also, owing to the proximity of the mosque, be blessed with perpetual benedictions for his soul. When his life drew to its close, finding that he had no son, he proclaimed Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n, who was his maternal grandson, and who had been brought up by him, as his heir and successor, and he entrusted to him charge of the treasures.\n\n1 Emperor Aurangzeb, though rather a bigot in some points, had scrupulous regard for the majesty of the Shar\u0101 or Law, and took considerable pains to improve the administration of Justice. The Q\u0101zis, or Magistrates and Judges, were exclusively recruited from the ranks of eminent scholars, and they were not subordinate to any except the Law itself, and their offices carried great prestige.\nand effects and the control of both the Niz\u0101mat and the Imperial offices. In 1139 A.H. he died. From the following Miqr'a, the date of his death is obtained:\n\n\u0632 \u062f\u0648 \u0631\u0627 \u0645\u0644\u06a9 \u062c\u0648\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0641\u0644\u0627\n\n(Translation) From the Imperial Capital, the rampart has fallen.\n\nWhen the numerical value of the word \u064a\u0631 is deducted from the word \u0645\u0644\u06a9, the date of his death is obtained.\n\nHe spurred on his steed of march towards eternity;\nHe has passed away, but his good name survives.\nAye, what better can anyone aspire to than this?:\nThat after he has passed away, his many virtues might survive.\u00b9\n\nNIZAMAT OF NAW\u0100B SHUJ'A-UD-D\u012aN\u00b2 MUHAMMAD KHAN WHO WAS ALREADY NAZIM OF THE SUBAH OF OD\u012aS\u0100 (ORISSA):\n\nWhen Naw\u0101b J'afar Kh\u0101n passed to the regions of eternity, Sarfaraz Kh\u0101n\u00b3 following the Naw\u0101b's dying wish, laid the former in the tomb under the staircase of the Katrah mosque, and himself ascended the masnad of Nizamat as his successor. And conciliating the Nizamat and Imperial officials, like Nawab J'afar Kh\u0101n he administered fiscal and administrative affairs. Save and except the Public Funds and Imperial treasures, he removed to his private residence the private treasures and effects of J'afar Kh\u0101n.

His father's name was Nuruddin, who came originally from Khorasan. He was son-in-law of Murshed Quli Khan, and was Nasim of Orissa, when Murshed Quli Khan became Subadar of Bengal. He received the title of Mutaman-ul-Mulk, Shujan-d-daulah Asad Khan (See Maasir, Vol. 3, p. 958, and Seir-ul-Mutakherin, Vol. 2, p. 469).\n\n\u00b3 His name was Mirza Assud-d-din, and his titles were Alau-d-daulah Sarfaraz Khan Haidar Jang'. He was a son of Shujan-d-din Khan, and a maternal grandson of Murshed Quli Khan.

On the death of the Emperor, the Q\u0101zi resigned. Kh\u0101n pressed him to continue, he died. Aurangzeb and during his reign only the nobility, the scholars, who passed examinations were appointed to offices. The title was never bestowed on the illiterate. Transfers in the offices of the nobility were made by the Emperors. Nor was any tax levied from the nobility. They had no superiors, nor any inferior. Itamad-ud-daulah Kh\u0101n, Faujdar of the province of Bihar, became the Senior (after whom the title was changed) and bore the name of B\u0101qir Kh\u0101n. He possessed great learning, eloquence, and oratory. He was the Imamr of Hughli; w' Muhammad Fasil, and his title was Itamadu-d-daulah Kh\u0101n. He was a son of Itamadu-d-daulah Muhammad Fasil. He was enticed away from Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah resigning the office of Vazir, and became Vazir of Emperor Muhammad Shah in 1197 A.H. He was liberal, affable, and polished.

In the Imperial Sanad of the Niz\u0101mat of Bengal, and in the support of the Imperial Ministers, he sent Alkishan, agent of Nawab Ja'far Kh\u0101n, at the time enjoyed more confidence and eminence than others. He also sent messages to other\n\nh,1 on receiving news of Nawab Ja'far Kh\u0101n, the S\u016bbahd\u0101r\u012b of Bengal on Amiru-l-Umar\u0101-n-i-Danr\u0101n Kh\u0101n Bah\u0101dur, Chief of the Army. The latter was Emperor's intimate associate both in social gaieties as well as negotiations, and was his comrade, companion, and counsellor in matters pertaining to feasts, as well as to wars. The Amiru-l-Umar\u0101 misled by the intrigues of the aforesaid agent, sent the patent and Khilat of the Deputy Niz\u0101mat of Bengal in the name of Shuj\u0101u-d-din Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n. Shuj\u0101u-d-din Kh\u0101n had reached this side of Mednip\u0101r, when the patent addressed to his name arrived, and viewing this event as a good omen, he named that place \"Mubarak-Manzil\" or \"the Auspicious place,\" and ordered a Katr\u0101h (a Tower) and a masonry-built Caravanserai to be erected there. When news of the approach of his father reached\n\n1 Emperor Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u0101h was raised to the Imperial throne of Delhi by the Syed brothers in 1181 A.H. See Seiru-l-Mutakkerin, Vol. II, p. 428.\n\n2 His name was Khwajah \u0100\u1e63am. His ancestors had come from Badakhshan to India, and settled at Agra. He held a small Mansab in the beginning under Prince Azim-ah-Shan, and was in the latter's company in Bengal at Dacca. When the Prince in obedience to the summons of his father, Mu\u1e25ammad Muazzam (afterwards Emperor Bahadur Sh\u0101h), on the death of Emperor Aurangzeb, left Bengal to join his father at Agra, he left Khwajah \u0100\u1e63am in the company of his son Farrukh Sir, who remained in Bengal on behalf of his father. He soon made himself a persona grata to Prince Farrukh Sir, and exercised considerable influence over his conduct and policy. Farrukh Sir conferred on him the title of 'Ashraf Kh\u0101n,' and on ascension to the throne conferred on him the further titles of \"Sam\u0101mu-d-daulah Kh\u0101n Dauran,\" and created him a Haft haz\u0101r\u012b, and second Bakhshi. In the reign of Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u0101h, on the fall of Syed Husain Ali Khan, he received the title of 'Amiru-l-Umara' and also became the Supreme Bukhshi or Generalissimo, or Paymaster-General of the Army. He fell during the war against Nadir Sh\u0101h who had invaded India in 1151 A.H. See Maasiru-l-Umara, Vol. I, p. 819.\nSarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n, owing to recklessness of youth, the latter intended marching to Katwah, in order to oppose his father's advance. The Dowager Begam of Naw\u0101b Ja'far Kh\u0101n, who was a very wise and sagacious lady, and who regarded Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n as dearer than her own life, dissuaded the latter, and with soft and sweet words of counsel set his mind at ease. She said to Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n:\n\n\"Your father is old; after him, the Shabahd\u0101r\u012b as well as the country with its treasures would devolve on you. To fight against one's own father, is cause of loss both in this world and in the next, as well as of ignominy. It is meet that till the lifetime of your father, you should remain contented with the Div\u0101ni of Bengal.\" Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n, who never acted against the advice of his grand-mother, acquiesced in her counsel. Advancing, he received Shuj\u0101u-d-din Muhammad Kh\u0101n, and escorted him to Murshid\u0101b\u0101d. Making over to his father the Fort and the offices of the Niz\u0101mat, Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n retired to his private residence at Nak\u1e6d\u0101khali. From there he used to attend daily on his father, and spend his time according to the latter's wishes. Retaining in his own service the Qor\u0101n-readers, hymn-reciters, and scholars belonging to Naw\u0101b Ja'far Kh\u0101n's household, Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n employed them on devotions and on recitations of the Qor\u0101n, as was the practice under Naw\u0101b Ja'far Kh\u0101n. He further consecrated his life to winning the hearts of people, and also sought for help and blessings from saints and hermits.\n\nShuj\u0101u-d-din Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n,\u00b9 who in point of bravery and\n\n\u00b9 The author of the Seiru-l-Mutakherin also pays a glowing tribute to the memory of Naw\u0101b Shuj\u0101u-d-din Kh\u0101n, and styles him a second Nan\u0161hirvan in justice and liberality. He treated all his officers, high and low, including soldiers and household servants, with affability and considerateness, and at the time of his death, begged their forgiveness, and gave them all two months' pay in advance. In the administration of justice, he was very impartial and made no difference between his own son and his humblest subject. He appreciated talent, and during his administration, people possessed of the east talent flocked into Bengal from all parts of Hindustan, and found a ready friend and helper in him. Bengal which enjoyed the title of 'Jinnatu-l-Bilad' or 'Paradise of Provinces,' now literally became so, under Shuj\u0101u-d-din Kh\u0101n's wise and beneficent administration. His charities were unostentatious and catholic, and his liberality was unstinted. His subjects, during his administration, enjoyed perfect peace and happiness. See Seiru-l-Mutakherin, Vol. II, pp. 472 and 488 (Pers. text).\n\nBy the way, the general immunity from civil wars and disturbances\ncourage was unique in his day, and who in point of liberality and generosity was matchless in his time, was born at Burh\u0101np\u016br.\u00b9\n\nAs he ascended the masnad of the Niz\u0101mat of Bengal in his old age, he felt compassion for the condition of the Bengal Zamindars, who being in distress from the time of Naw\u0101b Ja'far Kh\u0101n had never, even in dreams, beheld the faces of their wives and children. He set them at large, and permitted them to return to their homes, after levying from them Nazars over and above the amounts of revenue assessed by Naw\u0101b Ja'far Kh\u0101n. By this stroke of policy, over and above the profits of J\u0101girs and fees on ware-houses and factories, he easily raised one kror and fifty laks of rupees, which he remitted to the Imperial Treasury through the Banking Agency of Jagat Seth Fatih Ch\u0101nd. And selling off at fancy prices to Zamindars the jaded horses, cattle, and other live-stock, as well as damaged carpets and curtains belonging to the private estate of Nawab Ja'far Kh\u0101n, he sent another forty laks of rupees, besides elephants, to Emperor Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u0101h. And after the Abstract Balance-sheet of the Annual Accounts was prepared, he remitted to the Imperial Capital the stipulated annual tribute of the Niz\u0101mat, besides the Imperial Revenue, according to the established usage. And sending to the Emperor, at their proper seasons, elephants, T\u012bngan horses, special cotton-fabrics,\u00b2 and q\u016bshkhana\u00b3 and enjoyed by Bengal during the vigorous r\u00e9gimes of Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n and his successor, Shuj\u0101u-d-din Kh\u0101n (whilst the whole of Upper India was convulsed and torn by fratricidal wars and foreign invasions which converted those fair regions into human shambles), would in a large measure account for the existence of a comparatively large Musalman population in Bengal, contrasted with that in Upper India, without having recourse to theories of a more or less fanciful character, for which there appears little or no historical warrant.\n\n\u00b9 Burh\u0101np\u016br is described in the \u0100in (see Vol. II, p. 223) as \"a large city, three kos distant from the Tapti, in Subah Dandes or Khandes. It was embellished with many gardens, inhabited by people of all countries, and handicraftsmen plied a thriving trade.\"\n\n\u00b2 Kh\u0101jah is mentioned in the list of cotton-fabrics manufactured in India. See \u0100in, Vol. I, p. 94, for a list of cotton, silk and woollen manufactures of India, in Akbar's time.

He also received the personal Mansab of a Haft Haz\u0101r\u012b, with seven thousand troopers, besides a fringed P\u0101lk\u012b, together with the insignia of the Mahi Order, and a khila\u2018t consisting of six pieces of robes, precious stones, a jewel-mounted sword, and a Royal elephant with a horse. He was further confirmed in the office of N\u0101zim of Bengal. He surpassed his predecessors in office in paraphernalia of royalty and armaments, and though his prime of life had passed, he did not scorn life\u2019s pleasures. Dismantling the public buildings erected by Nawab Ja\u2018far Kh\u0101n, as they seemed too small according to his lofty ideals, he built instead a grand and spacious Palace, an Arsenal, a lofty Gateway, a Revenue Court,\u00b9 a Public Audience-Hall,\u00b2 a Private Office,\u00b3 a Boudoir for Ladies, a Reception-Hall,\u2074 a Court of Chancery\u2075 and a Court of Justice.\u2076 He lived in magnificent splendour, and used to ride out in right regal state. He attended constantly to the well-being of his Army, and to the happiness of his subjects. On his officers, he lavished largesses amounting to no less than one thousand or five hundred rupees in each case. Constantly animated by a scrupulous regard for justice, and always inspired by fear of\n\nteach people an improved system of manufacture. The Imperial workshops, the towns of Lahore, Agra, Fatehpur, Ahmadabad, Gujrat, turn out many master-pieces of workmanship; and the figures and patterns and knots, and variety of fashions which now prevail, astonish experienced travellers. His Majesty himself acquired a theoretical and practical knowledge of the whole trade, and on account of the care bestowed on them, the intelligent workmen of this country soon improved. All kinds of hair-weaving and silk-spinning were brought to perfection, and the Imperial workshops furnish all those stuffs which are made in other countries....\u201d See \u0100in-i-Akbari, Blochmann\u2019s translation, Vol. I, pp. 87, 88.\n\n\u00b9 \u2018The Diwan Khana\u2019 is a building containing the office of Diwan or Finance Minister.\n\u00b2 A \u2018Chihel Satun\u2019 means literally \u2018forty-pillared.\u2019 It was a large building, intended as a Public Audience-Hall.\n\u00b3 \u2018Khilwat Khhana\u2019 means a \u2018Private Chamber.\u2019\n\u2074 \u2018Julus-Kh\u0101na\u2019 means \u201cOffice-room or building.\u201d\n\u2075 Khali\u1e63ah Kacheri means the \u201cCourt of Exchequer,\u201d or the Revenue Court or Revenue Board in respect of Crown-land Affairs.\n\u2076 Farmanb\u0101ri means a \u2018Court of Justice.\u2019\nGod, he uprooted from his realm the foundations of oppressions and tyrannies. Executing N\u0101z\u012br Ahmad and Mur\u0101d Farr\u0101sh, the employ\u00e9s of Nawab Ja\u02bffar Kh\u0101n, who were notorious for their high-handedness, he confiscated their effects. N\u0101z\u012br Ahmad had laid the foundation of a Mosque with a garden at Dehpara on the banks of the river Bh\u0101girati. Shuj\u0101\u02bfu-d-daulah, after executing him, finished the mosque and garden, and named them after himself. And he tastefully embellished the garden by building therein grand palaces with reservoirs, canals and numerous fountains. It was a splendid garden, compared with which the spring-houses of Kashmir paled like withering autumn-gardens; nay, the garden of Iram\\(^1\\) itself seemed to draw its inspiration of freshness and sweetness from it. Shuj\u0101\u02bfu-d-daulah used frequently to resort for promenades and picnics to that paradise-like garden, and held there pleasure-parties and other entertainments. Every year in that beautiful garden, he used to give a State Banquet to the educated section\\(^2\\) of his State Officers. It is said that owing to the superb charmfulness of that garden, Fairies used to come down there for picnics and walks, and to bathe in its tanks. The guards on getting scent of this, informed Shuj\u0101\u02bfu-d-daulah. Dreading mischief from the genii, the Nawab filled up the tanks with earth, and discontinued his picnics in that garden.\n\nBeing fond of ease and pleasures, Nawab Shuj\u0101\u02bfu-d-daulah entrusted the duties of the Niz\u0101mat to a Council,\\(^3\\) composed of H\u0101ji\n\n---\n\n1 \u2018Iram\u2019 or \u064a\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0645\u0652 \u201cis the celebrated but fabulous garden said to have been anciently laid out in Arabia Felix by a king named Shadad-bin-i-Ad or Iram bin-i-Omad. Frequent mention of these gardens is made by the Eastern poets, who describe them as a perfect model of Paradise.\n\n2 It is significant that even in those declining years of the Mughal regime, towards the first quarter of the eighteenth century, scholarship and intellectual attainments had not ceased to command esteem amongst the Mughal Pro-Consuls.\n\n3 See slightly varied account in the \u2018Seirul-Mutakkerin,\u2019 which shews that Mirza Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n was the leading spirit in Shuj\u0101n-d-din\u2019s Council or Cabinet. See Seirul-Mutakkerin, Vol. II, p. 478 Pers. text. On ascending the g\u0101\u1e0d\u012b of Niz\u0101mat, Shuj\u0101n-d-din Kh\u0101n constituted a Cabinet of Advisers or Council of State, consisting of (1) Mirza Muhammad Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n alias Mirza Bandi, (2) H\u0101ji Ahmad, brother of No. 1, (3) Rai Rai\u1e63an \u2018Alam Ghand (formerly Shuj\u0101u-d-din\u2019s Diwan in Orissa), (4) Jagatset Fateh Ghand, the banker. In all important matters, he used to consult them before passing orders. His first measure was to release the Bengal Zamindars who had been imprisoned by Ja\u02bffar Kh\u0101n. This measure brought him not only\nAhmad, Rai Alamgand Diwan, and Jagat Set Fatehband, whilst the Nawab himself indulged in pleasures. Rai Alamgand Mukhtar,\n\npopularity but also an increase to the revenue (as Nazar was levied), and at the same time contributed to the fertility of Bengal, the Jinnatu-l-Bilad. (See Seiru-l-Mutakkerin, Vol. II, p. 473). For purposes of administration, he maintained his son Sarfaraz Khan as the nominal Diwan of Bengal, conferred the Subahdari of Orissa on his son (by another wife), named Muhammad Taqi Khan, the Deputy Nizamat of Jahangirnagar or Dacca on his son-in-law, Murshid Qali Khan II, the Fanjdarship of Bangpur on Sayid Ahmad Khan (nephew of Ali Vardi Khan), the Fanjdari of Rajmahal or Akbarasgar on Zainu-d-din Ahmad (another nephew and son-in-law of Ali Vardi Khan); Nawasish Mhd. Khan (another nephew of Ali Vardi) was created Generalissimo of the Army. See Seiru-l-Mutakkerin, Vol. II, p. 472.\n\n1 This preference of personal pleasures to the performance of public duties by the later Mughal pro-consuls and sovereigns of the 18th century, marks a sad moral collapse, and was one of the causes that hastened the downfall of the Great Mughal Empire in India. Preferring their own personal ease and pleasures, these later Moslem Satraps and Emperors delegated the unchecked control of their State concerns into the hands of ministers, who often proved unscrupulous, venal and treacherous, and scrupled not to barter them to intriguers for the sake of what they deemed to be their individual and personal self-aggrandisement. It was a failing which stood out in jarring contrast to the noble traditions and examples of a Babar, a Sher Shah, an Akbar, and an Aurangzeb, each of whom 'scorned delights and lived laborious days.' As bearing on the same point, I may also quote from Bernier's Travels pp. 129-130 the weighty words of Aurangzeb, whilst admonishing one of his Omarah who had ventured to express his fears lest the Emperor's incessant occupations might be productive of injury to his health. Thus burst forth the Great Monarch in the following noble strain:\u2014\"There can surely be but one opinion among you learned men as to the obligations imposed upon a sovereign, in seasons of difficulty and danger, to hazard his life, and, if necessary, to die sword in hand in defense of the people committed to his charge. And yet this good and considerate man would fain persuade me that the public weal ought to cause me no solicitude; that in devising means to promote it, I should never pass a sleepless night, nor spare a single day from the pursuit of some low and sensual gratification. According to him, I am to be swayed by considerations of my own bodily health, and chiefly to study what may best minister to my personal ease and enjoyment. No doubt, he would have me abandon the government of this vast kingdom to some Vizier: he seems not to consider that, being born the son\n\n2 The Seirul-Mutakkerin describes Alamgand as having formerly held the office of Diwan under Shuja'u-d-din Khan, when the latter held the office of Nasim of Orissa.

It is worthy of note that in Kattak (Cuttack) town, there is still a quarter or Mahalla known as 'Alamgand Bazar.'\nin the period of Shuj\u0101\u02bfu-d-daulah\u2019s Niz\u0101mat of Orissa, was a Muhrar attached to the latter\u2019s household. At this time, he was invested with the Deputy Diw\u0101ni of the \u0160ubah of Bengal, and being appointed Superintendent-General of the Affairs of the Niz\u0101mat and the Diw\u0101ni, he effected considerable retrenchments in the public expenditure, and received the personal Mansab of a Haz\u0101ri with the title of Rai Rai\u0101n\u2014a title which until that time no officer of the Bengal Niz\u0101mat or Diw\u0101ni had enjoyed. And H\u0101ji Ahmad\u00b9 and Mirz\u0101 Band\u012b were sons of Mirz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad, who was a cup-bearer of A\u02bf\u1e93am Sh\u0101h, a son of Emperor Aurangzeb \u0100\u02belamg\u012br. H\u0101ji Ahmad, on the death of his father, was appointed Cup-bearer and Superintendent of the jewellery-stores of Sult\u0101n Mu\u1e25ammad A\u02bf\u1e93am Sh\u0101h. As A\u02bf\u1e93am Sh\u0101h\u00b2 fell in the struggle for the Em-\n\nof a king, and placed on a throne, I was sent into the world by Providence to live and labour, not for myself, but for others; that it is my duty not to think of my own happiness, except so far as it is inseparably connected with the happiness of my people. It is the repose and prosperity of my subjects that it behoves me to consult; nor are these to be sacrificed to anything besides the demands of justice, the maintenance of the royal authority, and the security of the State. This man cannot penetrate into the consequence of the inertness he recommends, and he is ignorant of the evils that attend upon delegated power. It was not without reason that our great Saadi emphatically exclaimed:\u2014\u201cCease to be kings; Oh, cease to be kings; or determine that your dominions shall be governed only by yourselves....\u201d Alas! we are sufficiently disposed by nature to seek ease and indulgence; we need no such officious counsellors. Our wives too, are sure to assist us in treading the flowery path of rest and luxury.\u201d What a noble ideal of kingly duty!, and what a sad falling-off in later Moslem times!\n\n\u00b9 In Seirul-Muta\u1e25\u0101rin and Stewart\u2019s History of Bengal, it is stated that Mirz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad\u2019s eldest son was H\u0101ji Ahmad, and his second son was Mirz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad \u0100li (the latter received the title of Mu\u1e25ammad \u0100li Vardi Kh\u0101n, through the favour of Shuj\u0101\u02bfu-d-din Kh\u0101n, whilst the latter was Na\u1e63\u012bm of Orissa).

On Emperor Aurangzeb\u2019s death, there was a fratricidal struggle for the Empire between the above two brothers, with the result that at the sanguinary battle of Jaifo, near Agra, in 1119 A.H., A\u02bf\u1e93am Sh\u0101h, or Prince Mu\u1e25ammad A\u02bf\u1e93am, was killed, and Bahadur Sh\u0101h became victorious. See description of this sanguinary battle with the slaughter of several Princes Royal in the Seirul-Muta\u1e25\u0101rin, Vol. II, p. 377. Emperor Aurangzeb\u2019s third son, Prince Kam Baksh, similarly fell shortly after in 1120 A.H., near Haidarabad, in a similar fratricidal struggle with-\npire, at the time of this Revolution, the two brothers leaving the Imperial Capital proceeded to the Dakhin and thence to Odissa (Orissa), and entered there the service of Shuj\u0101'\u016b-d-daulah. Adopting a policy of tact and prudence which \"is a friend, and like water, takes to every hue,\" these two brothers got into the good graces of Shuj\u0101'\u016b-d-daulah. When Shuj\u0101'\u016b-d-daulah acquired the Ni\u1e93\u0101mat of the S\u016bbah of Bengal, H\u0101ji \u0100\u1e25mad became his intimate associate and councillor in all affairs of the Ni\u1e93\u0101mat; whilst Mirz\u0101 Bandi was invested with the Mans\u0101b and title of \u0100'li Vardi Kh\u0101n, and appointed Faujd\u0101r of the Qhakl\u0101h of Akbarnagar\u00b9 (R\u0101jmahal). Similarly, the H\u0101ji's eldest son, named Mu\u1e25ammad R\u012bz\u0101,\u00b2 received the office of D\u0101roghah or Superintendent of the Baj\u016btrah of Murshid\u0101b\u0101d; his second son, Ag\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad Sa'id, was appointed Deputy Faujd\u0101r of Rangpur; whilst his youngest son, Mirz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24\u0101shim, was invested with the Mans\u0101b and title of Hashim \u0100'li Kh\u0101n. Pir Kh\u0101n, who during Shuj\u0101'\u016b-d-daulah's stay at Burhanpur had rendered faithful services, and who from his youth to old age had passed his days in his company, was at this time invested with the Mans\u0101b and title of Shuja' Quli Kh\u0101n, and given the Faujd\u0101r\u012b of the Port of Hugli, on the transfer of A\u1e25sanul-lah Kh\u0101n.\n\nMerit is no passport to worldly advancement,\nWhen times are propitious, failings seem accomplishments.\n\nThe new Faujd\u0101r of Hugli commenced exactions and oppressions.

In Seir it is stated that he formed the leading spirit in the Council or Cabinet of advisers of Naw\u0101b Shuj\u0101'\u016b-d-din Kh\u0101n, and that the Faujd\u0101rship of Akbarnagar or Rajmahal was bestowed by Shuj\u0101'\u016b-d-din Kh\u0101n on \u0100'li Vardi Kh\u0101n's nephew and son-in-law named Zain-udd-in Ahmad. See Seir, Vol. II, p. 472.\n\n\u00b2 During the Ni\u1e93\u0101mat of \u0100'li Vardi Kh\u0101n, Mu\u1e25ammad R\u012bz\u0101 received the title of 'Nawazish Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n,' and was advanced to the office of Diwan of Bengal. I do not quite understand what the word 'Baj\u016btrah' in the text means. It probably signifies \"Miscellaneous Revenue.\"\nHouse, he requisitioned troops from the Emperor, commenced hostility with the English, Dutch, and French, and levied Nagars and taxes. It is said that once unloading from English vessels bales of silk and cotton-stuffs, and placing these below the fort, he confiscated them. The English troops advancing from Calcutta, arrived near the fort. Shuj\u0101' Quli Kh\u0101n finding himself an unequal match for them climbed down, when the English troops carried off their goods. The aforesaid Kh\u0101n writing to Naw\u0101b Shuj\u0101'u-d-daulah requisitioned troops to attack the English, and by cutting off supplies of Q\u0101simb\u0101z\u0101r and Calcutta, he reduced them to straits. The Chief of the English Factory at Q\u0101simb\u0101z\u0101r was compelled in consequence to arrange terms of peace, by agreeing to pay three laks of rupees as n\u0101gar to Shuj\u0101'u-d-daulah. The Chief of the English Factory in Calcutta, borrowing the n\u0101garana money from the Calcutta bankers, remitted it to Shuj\u0101'u-d-daulah.\n\nIn short, as the good services of Shuj\u0101'u-d-daulah came to the notice of the Emperor through the medium of Kh\u0101n Daur\u0101n Kh\u0101n, in recognition thereof, the Niz\u0101mat of the \u0160ubah of Behar on the transfer of Fakhru-d-daulah, brother of Raushanu-d-daulah Tur\u0101bb\u0101z Kh\u0101n, was also conferred by the Emperor on Naw\u0101b Shuj\u0101'u-d-daulah. The aforesaid Naw\u0101b considering Muhammad \u0100'li Vardi Kh\u0101n to be a person of capacity and tact, appointed him to be his Deputy Governor of Behar, and sent him to \u2018Azm\u0101b\u0101d (Patna) with five thousand cavalry and infantry. \u0100'li Vardi Kh\u0101n, arriving in the \u0160ubah of Behar, associated with himself, in the administration, General Abdul Karim\n\n1 Fakhru-d-daulah was \u0160ubadar of Behar from 1140 A.H. for about five years. He was given to ease and pleasures, and ill-treated not only his minister, Shaikh Abdullah, who enjoyed the confidence of the public, but also insulted Khwajah Mu'ta\u1e63\u1e63am (brother of Amiru-l-Umara \u0160amsanu-d-daulah Kh\u0101n Daur\u0101n Khwajah Asam). The latter in consequence left Patna, went to Delhi, and complained to his brother, who held great influence at the court of the Emperor, Muhammad \u0160\u0101h-Fakhru-d-daulah was at once recalled, and Behar was added to the Bengal satrapy under Naw\u0101b Shuj\u0101'u-d-din Kh\u0101n. The latter appointed Muhammad \u0100'li Vardi Kh\u0101n as his Deputy in the Nizamat of Behar, conferring on him (with the sanction of the Emperor) the title of Mahabat Jang, and promoting him to the rank of a Panjhasari. \u0100'li Vardi ruled over Behar vigorously.

Entrusting the reins of authority over administrative and revenue affairs to the hands of Abdul Karim Kh\u0101n, \u0100'li Vardi Kh\u0101n sent the former on an expedition against the Banjarah tribe, who were a class of marauders and murderers, and who in the guise of traders and travellers used to plunder the imperial domains and treasures. Abdul Karim Kh\u0101n, subduing the Banjarah tribe, gained a large booty. Muhammad \u0100'li Vardi, by chastising the Banjarah tribe, achieved a high reputation. And being aided by the Afgh\u0101ns, \u0100'li Vardi advanced with his forces against the tracts of the R\u0101j\u0101hs of Bitiah and Bhawarah, who were refractory and turbulent. Their regions had never previously been trod by the feet of the armies of former N\u0101zims, nor had their proud heads ever bended before to any of the former \u0160ubahd\u0101rs. Indeed, they had never before paid the imperial revenues and taxes. After fighting with them incessantly, \u0100'li Vardi Kh\u0101n became victorious and triumphant. Raiding and pillaging their tracts, \u0100'li Vardi Kh\u0101n carried off a large booty, amounting to several l\u0101ks, in specie and other effects. And settling with the R\u0101j\u0101hs the amounts of tribute, presents and the imperial revenue, he raised an immense sum. The soldiery also were enriched by the booty, and the strength of Ali Vardi's administration increased. And drawing his forces against the Qhakwar tribe, who had acquired a world-wide notoriety for their marauding propensities, Ali Vardi also extirpated them. Invading the tracts of the refractory and turbulent Zamindar of Bhojpur, and of R\u0101jah Sundar Singh, Zamindar of Tikari, and of Namdar Kh\u0101n Muin, who, sheltered by dense forests and rocks,\n\n1 Abdul Karim Kh\u0101n was a Rohilla Afghan; he was very brave and powerful, and had a large Afghan following.

See Ain Bloch, tr., Vol. I, p. 513 n.\n\nI cannot trace of which place in Bihar he was a local chieftain.\nhad not cared for former N\u0101gims, and had neglected to discharge loyal duties, and without coercion had never paid the Imperial revenue, Ali Vardi set about chastising every one of them, subdued their tracts thoroughly, levied the revenues from them to the fullest extent, and reduced them to thorough subjection. And, similarly punishing other insolent rebels, Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n placed the ring of submission on their ears. And in a short period becoming master of immense treasures and a large army, Ali Vardi\u2019s power and prestige grew enormously. As \u2018Abdul Karim Kh\u0101n held control over all the State affairs, he exercised absolute sway, and ignored Muhammad Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n. Hence the latter becoming suspicious of the former, inveigled him by some device into his own house, and slaying him raised the standard of triumph. And through the agency of Mu\u1e25ammad Ish\u0101q Kh\u0101n,\u00b9 Diw\u0101n of the Imperial Khal\u012b\u1e63ah, Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n opened negotiations with Qamru-d-din Kh\u0101n,\u00b2 the Imperial Vizier, and also with other Imperial Ministers, and succeeded in obtaining directly from the Emperor the title of Mahabat Jang\u00b3 Bahadur, without Shuj\u0101\u2018-d-daulah\u2019s recommendation. Shuj\u0101\u2018-d-daulah, who reposed full confidence in H\u0101ji Ahmad and Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n, viewed without misgivings this elevation of Ali Vardi\u2019s rank; but his son, Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n, felt misgivings about it. On account of this difference in views, between the father and the son a coolness set in. Another son of Shuj\u0101\u2018-d-daulah by a different wife was Mu\u1e25ammad Taqi Kh\u0101n. He was Deputy N\u0101gim of Orissa, and was not only brave and bold but was also popular with the Army. H\u0101ji Ahmad and Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n basing their intrigue on his rivalry contrived to bring about a rupture, advantageous to themselves, between the two brothers. When the plan of this intrigue was matured, H\u0101ji Ahmad secured the adhesion of R\u0101i R\u0101j\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam Ch\u0101nd and Jagatset Fateh Ch\u0101nd; and the\n\n\u00b9 For Ishaq Kh\u0101n, see Seir, Vol. II, p. 489. He enjoyed Emperor Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u0101h\u2019s confidence.\n\n\u00b2 When Nizam-un-Mulk A\u1e63af Jah resigned the Imperial Vizarat, I\u2019tamu-d-daulah Qamru-d-din Kh\u0101n, son of Mu\u1e25ammad Amin Kh\u0101n, succeeded him as Imperial Vazir of Emperor Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u0101h. See Vol. II, p. 457, Seiru-l-Mutakkerin. Pers. text.\n\n\u00b3 The Seiru-l-Mutakkerin, however, (see n. ante) states that Shuj\u0101\u2018-d-din Kh\u0101n secured from Emperor Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u0101h the title of \u2018Mahabat Jang\u2019 for his favourite and protege, Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n.\nTriumvirate now waited for the development of their conspiracy. Shuj\u0101\u02bfu-d-daulah, by the advice of the Triumvirate, was induced not to entrust the control of any affair to Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n. When the fibres of mistrust thus sown took root in the soil of the hearts of the son and the father, as well as of the two brothers, and these were about to germinate, Muhammad Taqi Kh\u0101n, ascertaining the real origin of this misunderstanding, proceeded from Orissa to Bengal, to personally interview his father and brother. The Councillors of Shuj\u0101\u02bfu-d-daulah, finding the odds of the times evenly balanced, fanned strifes and fomented jealousies between the two brothers, so much so that both the latter prepared to fight. Muhammad Taqi Kh\u0101n with his army rode out, and arrayed his force on a sandy plain, opposite to the Murshidabad Fort, on the other side of the river Bh\u0101girati. Thence he advanced to interview his father, but did not plunder the City. And the army of Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n was arranged in battle-array from N\u0101ktakh\u0101li to Sh\u0101hnagar, and was ready to kindle the fire of war and slaughter. Secretly tempting by offers of bribe the commanders and officers of Muhammad Taqi\u2019s army, Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n won them over to his side, and sending messages for Muhammad Taqi\u2019s capture, waited for the enemy, in the hope that when the two contending hosts would face each other in battle-array, his own officers would capture Muhammad Taqi and bring him in. Muhammad Taqi Kh\u0101n, who in bravery was the Rustam\\(^1\\) of his day, did not care for the enemy. The negotiations for peace and war passed and repassed between the two brothers. When Naw\u0101b Shuj\u0101\u02bfu-d-daulah saw that affairs had taken a grave turn, he intervened, reconciled the brothers, and prevented their fighting. And out of regard for the feelings of Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n and the Begams, rebuking several times Muhammad Taqi Kh\u0101n, Shuj\u0101\u02bfu-d-daulah prohibited the latter from coming to see and salute him. At length, at the intercession of Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n\u2019s mother, he pardoned Muhammad Taqi Kh\u0101n, and permitted him to go back to the Subah of Orissa. But on arrival in Orissa, in the year 1147 A.H., owing to the witchcraft of the enemy, he died.

By chance, Mir Hab\u012bb arrived in the Port of Hugli, where he earned his livelihood by retailing the wares of Mughal merchants. Owing to his kindred mercantile pursuits, and also owing to his conversational powers, Mir Hab\u012bb quickly ingratiated himself with Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n, and entered the latter\u2019s service. When Naw\u0101b Ja\u2018far Kh\u0101n conferred the Governorship of Jah\u0101ngir-nagar (Dacca) on Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n, Mir Hab\u012bb also went in the latter\u2019s company to Jah\u0101ngir-nagar (Dacca), and was attached to the latter as his Deputy.

The tomb of Muhammad Taqi Kh\u0101n is now in a dilapidated condition. On it I found still the following inscription:\n\nI may add that the Seiru-l-Mutoherin (Pers. text, p. 534), makes mention of this Katak Qadam Rasul building, and of the Deputy Governor, Abdal Nabi Kh\u0101n (father of Abdur Rasul Kh\u0101n, another Deputy Governor of Orissa), being entombed there. In this connection, I may point out there is a historical anachronism in the Qadam Rasul building inscription which states \u201cit was erected by Shuj\u0101\u2018-u-d-din Kh\u0101n in the time of Alamgir II.\u201d Shuj\u0101\u2018-u-d-din was not a contemporary of Alamgir II at all, he was a contemporary of Alamgir I whilst at Katak, and of Emperor Muhammad Shah, whilst Nazim of Bengal.\n\nThe reader must not confound this Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n (son-in-law of Shuj\u0101\u2018-u-d-daulah whose real name was Mirza Lutfullah) with Nawab Ja\u2018far Kh\u0101n, who had formerly held the title of \u2018Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n.\u2019 On reference to the account of Ja\u2018far Kh\u0101n in the text, it would appear that \u2018Ja\u2018far Kh\u0101n received several titles in succession; first he received the title of \u2018Kartalab Kh\u0101n,\u2019 next that of \u2018Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n,\u2019 and lastly that of \u2018Mutamad-ul-Mulk Alau-d-daulah Ja\u2018far Kh\u0101n Nasir Jang,\u2019 his original name having been Mirza Had\u012b.\nthe army, and thus rendered good services, and in consequence, shortly after, his official rank was raised. Finding the tract of Jah\u0101ngir-nagar (Dacca) to be fertile, profit-yielding, and suited for trading business, he revived the system of \u0160auda-i-Khas current during the Viceroyalty of Prince \u0100zimu-sh-Sh\u0101n, and by means of other exactions, both he and his Chief amassed wealth. On the pretext of collecting the Imperial revenue, he induced N\u016bru-l-lah, Zamindar of Parganah Jal\u0101lpur, who was the leading Zamindar, together with other Zamindars, to attend his Kachiri (Court). Adroitly dismissing the other Zamindars, one after another, Mir \u1e24abib kept N\u016bru-l-lah under duress. At midnight, he permitted him to return home, escorted by a number of Afgh\u0101ns. The latter, at the instigation of Mir \u1e24abib, slew N\u016bru-l-lah, in a narrow and dark alley. Next morning, Mir \u1e24abib announced that N\u016bru-l-lah had fled, sent a detachment to his house, confiscated his treasures and jewelleries and effects and silk-stuffs, amounting in value to several laks, as well as his Abyssinian male and female slaves. Mir \u1e24abib possessed himself of the above, and thus acquired aristocratic paraphernalia.\n\nSubsequently leagueing with \u0100q\u0101 Sadiq, Zam\u012bnd\u0101r of Patpas\u0101r, who in artfulness and cunning was his match, Mir \u1e24abib sent him on an expedition against Tiprah.

The first Jallapur or Sarail is situated in the Brahmanbaria Sub-Division of the present Tiprah district, and when I was in charge of that sub-division in 1896, I found the head of the Musalman family there (who was still called a Diwan) in an impoverished condition. The second Jallapur parganah is now in the modern Faridpur district, and is owned, I believe, by the present Musalman Zamindars of Habibganj in that district. It may be that 'Habibganj' owes its name to Mir Habib; specially as there was formerly a \"Chakshah Habibganj.\"\n\n2 I fail to find Patpasar in the Ain-i-Akbari. I have not been able to trace where it is, nor know if any descendants of this family survive. I may, however, add here that local traditions prevalent in Tiprah mention that the Diwans of Horishpur (another old family of Musalman Zamindars, now in an impoverished condition) had something to do with the old Tiprah B\u0101jahs, and with their conquest by the Mughals. I am not sure if Aqa or Aga Sadiq of the text was connected with the above family.\ntrol of his uncle was wandering away from his native country, and who at this time happened to stay within the Imperial dominions. The aforesaid \u0100q\u0101 considering his company very lucky kept him in his company, promising to instal him in the Zamin-d\u0101r\u012b. The R\u0101jah's nephew, according to the saying,\u2014\n\n\"The hare of that country can assuredly catch the dog of that tract,\"\u2014\n\nguided the \u0100q\u0101 through the rocky defiles and river-fords, and led him to the country of Tiprah. The R\u0101jah of Tiprah, who was careless and was unaware of the incursion of the Imperial army, was paralysed by this sudden on-rush of the Imperialists, and not having the capacity to fight fled to the summit of the hills. The tract of Tiprah, without any difficulty, fell into the hands of Mir Habib, who by fightings stormed the fort of Chandigadah, which was the residence\u00b9 of the R\u0101jah. Capturing numerous booty, Mir Habib brought the tract of Tiprah within the Imperial domains. After completing the settlement of this tract, Mir Habib\u00b2 appointed \u0100q\u0101 Sadiq as Faujdar of Tiprah, and the\n\n\u00b9 The present residence of the R\u0101jah of Hill Tiprah is at Agartala. I do not know where Chandigadah lies. It could not have been far away from Agartala.

(also see Maasiru-l-Umara, Vol. II, p. 844). He subsequently joined the Mahrattas, and induced the latter to invade Orissa and Bengal in order to have his revenge against Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n for supplanting from the Governorship of Orissa, his old master and benefactor, Mur\u0101hid Quli Kh\u0101n (son-in-law of Shuj\u0101'-u-d-din Kh\u0101n). He appears to have been a man of wonderful resourcefulness, bravery and tact, and gave no end of trouble to Ali Vardi, who at length had to patch up a peace with Mir Habib and the Mahrattas, by appointing Mir Habib as his Deputy Nasim in Orissa, the arrangement being that Mir Habib was to pay the Mahratta army of occupation from the revenue of Orissa, besides receiving from Ali Vardi an annual subsidy of twelve laks. Mir Habib's signal services to the Mahrattas in the end were most churlishly requited by the latter, for Janoji, son of the Mahratta Raghoji Bhonsla, treacherously murdered him at Katak (see Seiru-l-Mutakkerin, Vol. II, p. 592, Pers. text), after having invited him to a feast. But throughout their rise, treachery was their great weapon of offence and defence, and the Mahratta freebooters could not lay it down, even in the treatment of one, who, though distinct from them in race and religion, had given them the virtual mastery over the Province of Orissa.\nRajah's nephew as the Rajah, whilst he himself returned to Jahangirnagar (Dacca) with treasures, valuables and elephants. Murshid Quli Khan sent to Nawab Shuja'u-d-daulah an account of the conquest of Tiprah, together with the best specimens of the wares and silk-stuffs of that tract. The Nawab named that tract (of Tiprah) Ranghanabad, and invested Murshid Quli Khan with the title of 'Bahadur,' and conferred on Mir Habib the title of 'Kh\u00e2n.'\n\nIn short, when the Deputy-Nizamat of the Subah of Odisah (Orissa) was bestowed on Murshid Quli Khan, the latter, on the recommendation of Nawab Shuja'u-d-daulah, was given by the Emperor the title of Rustam-Jang. Observing the old age of his father, and fearing lest after the latter's death Rustam-Jang might fight against him, Sarfaraz Khan detained at Murshidabad as hostages Rustam-Jang's son, named Yahya Khan, and his wife, named Durdanah Begam. Although this incident caused some bitterness of feeling to Murshid Quli Khan, the latter had no alternative but to endure it in silence. Murshid Quli Khan with his army arrived in the Subah of Orissa, and appointed Mir Habibu-l-lah Khan to be his Deputy there, in the same way as the latter had been his Deputy at Jahangirnagar. By use of diplomacy, and by dint of statesmanship and energy, Mir Habib succeeded in chastising and reducing to order all refractory Zamindars of Orissa. He neglected no step towards the perfect organisation and settlement of Orissa, and effected a surplus in its revenue. During the commotion in Mohammad Taqi Khan's time, the Rajah of Parsutam had removed Jagannath, the Hindu\n\n1 Evidently, the Rajah was no longer an independent Rajah, but was left more or less as a feudatory prince.\n\n2 When I was at Brahmanbaria in 1896, I found the Court peons' badges still bearing the word \"Chaklak Ranghanabad.\" I do not know if they have been since changed.\n\n3 Murshid Quli Khan II Rustam-Jang was a son-in-law of Nawab Shuja'u-d-din Khan, having married Durdana Begam, step-sister of Sarfaraz Khan.

In consequence of the removal of the idol, there was a falling-off to the tune of nine lacs of rupees in the Imperial revenue, accruing from pilgrims. Establishing friendly relations with Mir Habibu-l-lah Kh\u0101n, and paying nazar to the Nazim of the time, R\u0101jah Dand Deo brought back Jagannath the Hindu God to Pars\u016btam (Puri), and re-established the worship of Jagann\u0101th at Puri.

See Hunter\u2019s \u2018Orissa.\u2019\n\n\u00b2 It may be noted here there was a radical change in the administrative machinery of Bengal, during the latter part of Emperor Aurangzeb\u2019s reign. The offices of Nazim and Diwan had been hitherto kept quite distinct, but a retrograde step towards their eventual amalgamation was taken by Aurangzeb, when the latter appointed his favourite officer Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n I. (afterwards Naw\u0101b Ja\u02bffar Kh\u0101n) to the dual offices of Diwan of Bengal and Orissa and Deputy Nazim of Bengal and Orissa. Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n I. could not personally perform the functions of these dual offices, and whilst himself personally holding the portfolio of Deputy Nizamat of Bengal (the Chief Nazim being still Prince Azimu-sh-Shan), he delegated the office of Diwan in Bengal to Syed Akram Kh\u0101n and, on the latter\u2019s death, to Syed Razi Kh\u0101n, (son-in-law of Shuj\u0101\u02bf-ud-d\u012bn Kh\u0101n,) and that of Deputy Nazim and Diwan of Orissa to Shuja\u02bf-ud-d\u012bn Kh\u0101n (his son-in-law). Emperor Farrukh Sir, on his accession to the throne of Delhi, further confirmed and accentuated the above administrative change by uniting in the person of Naw\u0101b Ja\u02bffar Kh\u0101n the offices of Nazim of Bengal and Orissa, and of Diwan of those Provinces. This union of the two offices, whilst weakening the Imperial hold thereon, greatly added to the prestige of the Bengal Satrap, and gave him almost a semi-regal aspect. This regal aspect was further broadened by Emperor Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u0101h adding Behar to the Bengal Satrapy, whilst Naw\u0101b Shuja\u02bf-ud-d\u012bn was the Bengal Viceroy. For purposes of administration, Shuja\u02bf-ud-d\u012bn appointed a State Council of three members to help him in the administration, and divided his entire Satrapy, consisting of three Provinces of Bengal, Behar, and Orissa, into four Political or Administrative Divisions, viz.: (1) Bengal Proper, comprising Western, Central, and a portion of Northern Bengal, (2) Jahangir-nagar or\nguardian, to be the Diwan and Minister of that place, and sent him to Dacca, in company of Ghalib Ali Khan. And out of regard for Nafisah Begam, his sister, he bestowed the office of Superintendent of the Nawarath (war-vessels) on Murad Ali Khan, son of Syed Razi Khan. The control over Fiscal and Home affairs, and the management of Crown-lands, Jagirs, war-vessels, artillery, Accounts and Customs-house were all entrusted to Munshi Jasunat Rai. In that the aforesaid Munshi had been trained up by Nawab Ja'far Khan, by dint of honesty and integrity, by thorough attention to details and by ripe wisdom, he effected not only an increase in the State Revenue, but secured the happiness of the people. He completely abolished the system of Sauda-i-khas, and banished the exactions and innovations introduced by Mir Habib, during the regime of Murshid Quli Khan. Putting forth laudable efforts to keep down the selling-rates of food-grains, and effecting cheapness in their prices, he threw open the western gate of the Fort of Jahangirnagar (or Dacca), which Nawab Amir-ul-Umar Shaistah Khan had closed, inscribing on it a prohibition to the effect that no one should open it, until he succeeded in reducing\n\nDacca Division comprising Eastern and Southern Bengal, and a small portion of Northern Bengal, and including Sylhet and Chittagong, (3) Behar Division, (4) Orissa Division. Shuja'u-d-din Khan directly administered the first Division, and appointed a Deputy Nazim or Deputy-Governor to hold charge of each of the other three Administrative Divisions, under his general control and supervision.\n\n1 Murad Ali Khan was a son of Nafisah Begam, uterine sister of Sarfaraz Khan. Nafisah Begam was a daughter of Shuja'u-d-din Khan, and was married to Syed Razi Khan, who was Diwan of Bengal, on the death of Syed Akram Khan, during the regime of Nawab Ja'far Khan. On Syed Razi Khan's death, during the reign of Emperor Farrukh Sir, on the nomination of Nawab Ja'far Khan (his maternal grandfather), Mirza Asadul-lah received the title of Sarfaraz Khan and was appointed Diwan of Bengal, Sarfaraz Khan continued to be the nominal Diwan of Bengal, whilst his father Shuja'u-d-din Khan succeeded Nawab Ja'far Khan as Nazim of Bengal, being deprived, however, of all real power, which was transferred to the State Council, consisting of Haji Ahmad (brother of Ali Vardi Khan), Diwan Alamgirhan, and Fatihchand Jagat Set.\n\n2 Mirza Lutfullah, surnamed Murshid Quli Khan II, son-in-law of Shuja'u-d-din Khan. He was first Deputy-Governor of Jahangirnagar (Dacca), and was subsequently transferred in the same capacity to Orissa. He should not be confounded with Nawab Ja'far Khan who also held the title of Murshid Quli Khan.\nthe price of food-grains to one seer of the Baz\u0101r weight per Dirham,\\(^1\\) as was current in the Nawab's time. From that time until now, no one else had been able to effect such cheapness in the rate of food-grains. He rendered the tract of Jahangirnagar (Dacca) fertile, like the garden of Iram\\(^2\\), by sprinkling on it the waters of liberality, equity and justice; and in consequence, Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n won a good name amongst all classes of his subjects. At the desire of Nafisah B\u0113gam\\(^3\\), Mur\u0101d \u0100li Kh\u0101n was married to a daughter of Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n, and was appointed Deputy-Governor of Jahangirnagar (Dacca) in the place of Gh\u0101lib \u0100'li Kh\u0101n. Murad \u0100li Kh\u0101n now promoted R\u0101j Balab, a clerk attached to the Admiralty, to the office of P\u0113shk\u0101r thereof, and commenced oppressions.\\(^4\\) Munshi Jas\u016bnat Rai, who had acquired a good name amongst the people, apprehending that his reputation might be tarnished, resigned his office of Diw\u0101n, and the Province of Jahangirnagar or Dacca turned to desolation through the tyranny of the new oppressive Deputy N\u0101z\u012bm.\n\nMirz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad Sa'id, the second son of H\u0101ji Ahmad, who was on behalf of Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n Fanjdar of the Chakl\u0101h of Ghor\u0101gh\u0101t and Rangpur and Knoh Beh\u0101r, desolated the Mahals of Rangpur by his exactions and oppressions, and acquiring the treasures of\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See n. ante and the text with reference to Naw\u0101b Shaista Kh\u0101n.\n\n\\(^2\\) See n. ante.\n\n\\(^3\\) Nafisah B\u0113gam was a sister of Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n, and Mur\u0101d \u0100'li Kh\u0101n was a son of Nafisah B\u0113gam, by Syed Razi Kh\u0101n, Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n's predecessor in the office of Diw\u0101n of Bengal. Thus, Mur\u0101d \u0100'li Kh\u0101n was a nephew of Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n. He, hitherto, held the office of Superintendent of the Naw\u0101r\u0101h (war-vessels) at Dacca, and on his marriage with Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n's daughter, was promoted to the office of Deputy-Governor of Jahangirnagar (Dacca), in succession of Gh\u0101lib \u0100'li Kh\u0101n. It may be interesting to note that there is a place called Mur\u0101dnagar, near Daudkandi, in Comilla, which is associated with some former Naw\u0101bs of Dacca, and where some landed property is still, I believe, owned by the Bhiknapahari Naw\u0101bs of Patna, said to be descended from an extinct old Naw\u0101b family of Dacca. I fancy, therefore, Mur\u0101dnagar owes its name and origin to this Mur\u0101d \u0100'li Kh\u0101n.\n\n\\(^4\\) Rajballab's son, Kishan Ballab, in the time of Naw\u0101b Siraj-ud-daulah, fled from Dacca to Calcutta, and by his intrigues brought about a rupture between Siraj-ud-daulah and the English. See Seiru-l-Mutak\u0101berin, Vol. II, Pers. text, p.621. Rajballab was the evil genius of Mur\u0101d \u0100'li Kh\u0101n, as Alamg\u012br was the evil genius of Shuja'ud-din Kh\u0101n, and Ratang\u012br that of the Syed brothers. See note ante. Rajballab subsequently ingratiated himself with the infamous Miran, son of Mir Ja'far.\nthose whom he oppressed, he mobilised an army. Requisitioning troops from the Emperor, he marched with his troops against the R\u0101jahs of Kuch Beh\u0101r and Din\u0101jp\u016br. Those Rajas fancying they were masters of large armies, and also fancying that they were sheltered by numerous forests and rivers, had hitherto paid little heed to the authority of the N\u0101zim. By dint of diplomacy and by use of force, and by wars and battles, Mirz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad Sa\u02bfid conquered those tracts, and acquired possession of the treasures, buried hoards, jewelleries and effects of those R\u0101jahs. Owing to the immense treasure\u2014indeed the treasure of a Croesus\u2014that thus fell into his hands, he acquired much power. After the conquest of Kuch Bih\u0101r, by humouring \u1e24\u0101ji Ahmad, on the recommendation of Naw\u0101b Shuj\u0101\u02beu-d-daulah and Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n, Mirz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad Sa\u02bfid received the titles of \u2018Kh\u0101n\u2019 and \u2018Bah\u0101dur.\u2019\n\nNaw\u0101b Shuj\u0101\u02beu-d-daulah, on the advice of his Triumvirate Council, deputed Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n to chastise Badi\u02bfu-z-zam\u0101n, zamind\u0101r of Birbh\u016bm. Sheltered by rocks and forests and supported by numerous Afgh\u0101ns, this zamind\u0101r did not bend his head in submission to the N\u0101zim, and failed to pay the revenue beyond the stipulated tribute. He had also diverted to dancing-parties and pleasures fourteen laks of revenue derived from the measured and cultivated lands, that had been endowed for the express purpose of helping the poor and the scholarly. The zamind\u0101r himself was plunged in dissipations and frivolities. On the ridges of Khubra Kandi and Lakra Khondah and of other hills and narrow rocky defiles, he had mounted strong guards, and cut off all ingress and egress of the Imperial troops and scouts, and he fancied the forest flanked by the hills to be a secure recess, in that no one could enter that tract without his passport. He had appointed his brother, A\u1e93am Kh\u0101n, to administer his State, and his son, A\u02bfli Quli Kh\u0101n, to command his army, and Naubat Kh\u0101n to be his Diw\u0101n and Minister. Badi\u02bfu-z-zam\u0101n himself did no work, but wasted his time on flute-playing and on carousals. Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n sent him a message, containing promises and rewards in the event of his submission to Naw\u0101b Shuj\u0101\u02beu-d-daulah, and embodying also threats and punishments in the event of his recalcitrance and disloyalty. Subsequently, Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n despatched via Bardw\u0101n his special confidantes, Khwajah Basant and Mir Sharfu-d-din, the second Paymaster-General, with a large army. Badi\u02bfu-z-zam\u0101n now prudently woke up from the slumber of vanity, and teu-\ndered his homage and submission. Inducing the aforesaid Mir and\nthe above Khw\u0101jah to become his interceders, he sent through the\nlatter a petition expressive of submission and loyalty, and subse-\nquently in the company of the former he set out for Murshidabad.\nAnd after waiting on Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n, through the introduction of\nMir Sharfu-d-din, Badi\u2018u-z-zam\u0101n was granted an audience by\nNaw\u0101b Shuj\u0101\u2018u-d-daulah, who not only pardoned his past misde-\nmeanour, but generously bestowed on him khila\u2018ts. Badi\u2018u-z-\nzaman agreed to pay three laks of rupees annually on account of\nthe Imperial revenue, consented to abide by the ordinary proce-\ndures for payment of land-revenue and for execution of orders, and\nfurnished as his surety Karatghand,1 zamind\u0101r of Bardw\u0101n. He\nwas then allowed to return to Birbhum.\n\nTowards the close of the year 1151 A.H., when N\u0101dir Shah\ninvaded2 the Imperial Capital, and \u0160ams\u0101mu-d-daulah Kh\u0101n-daur\u0101n\nfell in the battle3 against N\u0101dir Shah, Naw\u0101b Shuj\u0101\u2018u-d-daulah\nbeing ill and confined to bed permitted Yahy\u0101 Kh\u0101n and Dur-\nd\u0101nah Begam (son and wife respectively of Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n)\nto go to Orissa, and proclaimed Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n as his heir. Ear-\nnestly exhorting the latter to confide in H\u0101ji Ahmad, the R\u0101i\nR\u0101i\u0101n4 and Jagatset, and always to respect their feelings, and\nentrusting to him control over the offices of the Niz\u0101mat, Naw\u0101b\nShuj\u0101\u2018u-d-din Kh\u0101n died on the 13th Zilhaj of the aforesaid year.\nAfter laying to rest Shuj\u0101\u2018u-d-daulah\u2019s5 corpse in the sepulchre\nwhich he (Shuj\u0101\u2018u-d-daulah) had in his lifetime erected at Deh-\npara, opposite to the Fort and the City of Murshid\u0101b\u0101d, Sarfar\u0101z\n\n---\n\n1 Badi\u2018u-z-zam\u0101n Kh\u0101n of Birbhum, and Karatghand of Bardwan, appear to\nhave been the two principal zamind\u0101rs in Western Bengal at the time. I un-\nderstand the descendants of Badi\u2018u-z-zam\u0101n still survive at Birbhum, but are\nin an impoverished condition.\n\n2 A full description of N\u0101dir Shah\u2019s invasion will be found in all Indian\nhistories, and also in Seiru-l-Mutakkerin, Vol. II, p. 482.\n\n3 This battle took place at Karnal, 4 stages (mansal) distant from Shah-\njahanabad or Delhi, in 1151 A.H. See Seir, Vol. II, p. 482.\n\n4 That is, Rai Alamghand, Shuj\u0101\u2018u-d-din Kh\u0101n\u2019s de facto Diwan. He receiv-\ned the title of \u2018R\u0101i R\u0101i\u0101n\u2019 from the Emperor, on the recommendation of\nhis master, Naw\u0101b Shuj\u0101\u2018u-d-din Kh\u0101n. See Seir, Vol. II, p. 471.\n\n5 It should be noted that both \u201cShuj\u0101\u2018u-d-din Kh\u0101n\u201d and \u201cShuj\u0101\u2018u-d-\ndaulah\u201d signify one and the same person. These were his titles. This\n\u201cShuj\u0101\u2018u-d-daulah,\u201d better known as \u201cShuj\u0101\u2018u-d-din Kh\u0101n\u201d must not be con-\nfounded with the Naw\u0101b Vizier Shuj\u0101\u2018u-d-daulah of later history.\nKh\u0101n mounted the masnad of the Niz\u0101mat in the place of his father.\n\nNIZ\u0100MAT OF NAW\u0100B SARFAR\u0100Z KH\u0100N.\n\nWhen Naw\u0101b Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n mounted the masnad of the Niz\u0101mat of Bengal, agreeably to the dying instructions of his father, he appointed H\u0101ji Ahmad, the R\u0101i Rai\u0101n and Jagatesh to be his Councillors in respect of Revenue and Administrative affairs. But these meddling more than before in State affairs ignored the old officers of Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n who expected promotions and mansabs, and further intrigued to bring about their disgrace and overthrow. Although Naw\u0101b Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n and the Begams were anxious to promote their old officers, owing to the opposition of the Triumvirate Council, they could not do so. The Triumvirate Council, after secret vows and stipulations, plotted to call in Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n with his army from \u2018Azimabad (Patna) under pretext of visiting the Nazim, and then to instal him on the masnad of the Niz\u0101mat in supercession of Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n. And in deliberations over this plot they passed days and nights, but failed to mature any plan. At this time, N\u0101dir Sh\u0101h, the king of Persia, had defeated Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u0101h, captured Niz\u0101mu-l-Mulk, Burh\u0101nu-l-Mulk, Qamru-d-din Kh\u0101n, and Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n Bangash, &c., who were the pillars of the Mughal Empire, and en-\n\n1 The author of the Maaseru-l-Umara states that Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n rendered himself unpopular by adopting a policy of rigid economy and retrenchment, and by reducing his army, and that this gave an opportunity to Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n to intrigue, in concert with the latter\u2019s brother, H\u0101ji Ahmad, who was Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n\u2019s chief councillor. See p. 844, Maaseru-l-Umara, Vol. II, p. 844. It should, however, be added in justice to Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n\u2019s memory that this policy was inspired by the faithless Triumvirate Councillors, whom Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n trusted owing to the dying exhortations of his father, and that it formed a part of the despicable trap they were cunningly laying to ruin and overthrow their benefactor\u2019s son. One feels sick to dwell on such tales of vile treachery, for Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n from all accounts appears to have been an ideally noble and mild prince.\n\n2 N\u0101dir Sh\u0101h was a soldier of fortune. After capturing Sh\u0101h Tahmasp, King of Persia, he held a Council of State, and got himself elected as King of Persia. See his life in Namai Khusrav (p. 153), which also gives his portrait.\n\n3 For details, see Seiru-l-Mutakherin, p. 482 (Pers. text). It would appear, even at this crisis in the fate of the Empire, the venal Ministers of Emperor\ntering Shah-jah\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d (Delhi) with his Persian troops had plundered the palaces of both the Emperor and his nobles. In consequence, the whole Empire was shaken to its foundation. The Triumvirate Council persuaded Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n to introduce in Bengal the coins and the Khutbah of N\u0101dir Sh\u0101h, and about the same time they remitted the confiscated treasures of Shuj\u0101\u02bf-ud-daulah and the Bengal tribute in charge of Murid Kh\u0101n, who had arrived in Murshid\u0101b\u0101d on behalf of Qamru-d-din Kh\u0101n long before N\u0101dir Sh\u0101h's invasion. H\u0101ji Ahmad and Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n intrigued with Murid Kh\u0101n, and won him over to their side. On the withdrawal of N\u0101dir Sh\u0101h, they carried tales of the introduction of the N\u0101dir Sh\u0101hi coin and Khutbah to Naw\u0101b Qamru-d-din Kh\u0101n and to Niz\u0101mu-l-Mulk, and laid various other charges against Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n. Aided by the machinations of the Imperial ministers, they secured a royal patent granting to them the Niz\u0101mat of Bengal, and authorising the execution of Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n, on account of his treason in introducing the coin and Khutbah of N\u0101dir Sh\u0101h. When the Muhammad Sh\u0101h could not put aside personal feelings and cliannish jealousies\u2014the great bane of all Moslem races and the grave of so many Musalman Empires,\u2014nor could combine loyally in one common and sacred cause to repel the enemy's invasion of India. Burhanu-l-Mulk was the greatest delinquent in this respect. Only Niz\u0101mu-l-Mulk and Qamru-d-din Kh\u0101n appear in better light, and seem to have worthily maintained the high traditions of their great offices. For Niz\u0101mu-l-Mulk Asif Jah, and Qamru-d-din Kh\u0101n, see Maasere-l-Umara, Vol. III, p. 837, and Vol I, p. 368.\n\n1 For some gruesome details of the sack of Delhi and the general massacre of its population, see Seiru-l-Mutakkerin, Vol. II, p. 485.\n\n2 N\u0101dir Sh\u0101h's invasion was one of the great external calamities that overtook the Mughal Empire and hastened its ruin.\n\n3 Khutba was also recited after N\u0101dir Sh\u0101h's name in all the mosques of Delhi on his entry there. See Seir.\n\n4 He was at the time Chief Vizier or Prime Minister of Emperor Muhammad Sh\u0101h.\n\n5 The principal Imperial Minister who sided with H\u0101ji Ahmad and Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n in their intrigue, was Mutamu-d-daulah Ishaq Kh\u0101n. The latter exercised at the time great influence over Emperor Muhammad Sh\u0101h. See p. 489, Seiru-l-Mutakkerin.\n\n6 The Triumvirate Councillors were themselves responsible for this treason, which was a part of their adroitly-laid plot to overthrow Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n, by subsequently denouncing the latter before the Emperor Muhammad Sh\u0101h. It is a pity Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n the Good, owing to his guilelessness and lack of insight, could not see through their despicable game of villainy.\narrow of their efforts reached the butt of their aim, the Triumvirate Council represented to Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n that the resources of the State were limited, whilst its expenditure was heavy, and thereby persuaded the Naw\u0101b to reduce the strength of his Army. They at the same time secretly sent instructions to Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n to mobilise troops and collect arms, in view of the invasion of Bengal. Whoever was cashiered from the army of Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n was straightway enlisted by H\u0101ji Ahmad in the service of Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n, and sent off to Azim\u0101b\u0101d (Patna). Nearly one-half of Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n's troops were in this way disbanded. Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n, having completed preparations for war and mobilised a large army consisting of Afgh\u0101ns, Rohilahs, and Bhalias, set out for Bengal; whilst H\u0101ji Ahmad sent his and his sons' hoarded treasures amounting to several lakhs of rupees for the expenses of Ali Vardi's army. When Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n, from the despatches of his Political Agents at the Court of the Emperor, and from informations of emissaries, came to be apprised of the machinations of the treacherous enemy, deeming it prudent to adopt remedy for the affair before it came to pass, he set himself to overthrow the traitors, and decided to bestow the Deputy-Governorship of Azim\u0101b\u0101d (Patna) on his son-in-law, Syed Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24asan, in supercession of Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n, and the Faujd\u0101ri of \u0100kbarnagar (R\u0101jmahal) together with the command of Sakrigali and Teliagadh passes on Mir Sharfu-din Bakhshi, in supercession of A\u02bf\u1e6d\u0101n-l-lah Kh\u0101n, son-in-law of H\u0101ji Ahmad. Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n also determined to appoint Munshi Jasunat Rai as Diwan in the place of the Rai Rai\u0101n. But as yet this decision had not been put in force, when the members of the Triumvirate Council adroitly submitting a representation about their long services, the heavy outstanding of the Imperial Revenue, and their losses, persuaded Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n to postpone their supercession and the installation of others in their places till their preparation of the Annual Balance-sheet, which fell due after three months. Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n, who owing to guilelessness of\n\n1 See slightly varied accounts in the Seiru-l-Mutakkerin (p. 489), which states that Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n transferred the office of Diwan from H\u0101ji Ahmad to Mir Murtaza, and contemplated transferring the Faujdari of Rajmahal from Atan-l-lah Kh\u0101n to his son-in-law, Hasan Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n.\n\n2 This is the old story of gaining time. Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n exhibited a lamentable lack of judgment in accepting this false representation of his faithless Councillors. His credulity, indecision, and generous impulsiveness cost him\nhis nature had already been victimised by the duplicity of the Triumvirate Council, once again suffered himself to be duped by their wiles. A'li Vardi Kh\u0101n, utilising this short respite, secured the adhesion of Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Kh\u0101n, Shamsh\u0113r Kh\u0101n, Sard\u0101r Kh\u0101n, U'mar Kh\u0101n, Rah\u012bm Kh\u0101n, Karam Kh\u0101n, Sir\u0101nd\u0101z Kh\u0101n, Shaikh Ma'sam, Shaikh Jah\u0101ng\u012br Kh\u0101n, Muhammad Z\u016blufuq\u0101r Kh\u0101n, Chidan Haz\u0101ri (Bakhshi of the Bhaliyas), Bakhtawar Singh, and other Generals and officers of the Army. Under the false pretext of waiting on Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n, A'li Vardi Kh\u0101n marched swiftly, crossed the passes of Tiliagadhi and Sakrigali, and reached the frontiers of Bengal. At the instigation of H\u0101ji Ahmad, Ataullah Kh\u0101n, Faujd\u0101r of Akbarnagar (Rajmahal), had taken steps to prevent all movements of messengers and spies, and to interdict all intercourse through news-letters between A'\u1e93im\u0101b\u0101d (Patna) and Bengal via the passes of Tiliagadhi and Sakrigali, until A'li Vardi Kh\u0101n had crossed through those passes. In consequence, no news of A'li Vardi Kh\u0101n's movements had reached Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n. It was only when the vanguard of A'li Vardi Kh\u0101n's army had actually reached Akbarnagar (Rajmahal), that all of a sudden the news of Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n's movement reached Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n. This news threw both the City of Murshidabad and its Bazaar into commotion. Perplexed by this news, Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n instantly imprisoned H\u0101ji Ahmad. Although the R\u0101i R\u0101i\u0101n treacherously explained that A'li Vardi's arrival was for the purpose of waiting on Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n, this explanation had no reassuring effect. Detailing Ghans Kh\u0101n and Mir Sharfu-d-din, who were his old officers, to lead the vanguard, and leaving his son, H\u0101fi\u1e93u-l-lah surnamed Mirz\u0101 \u0100m\u0101ni, together with Y\u0101sin Kh\u0101n: Faujd\u0101r, to guard the Fort and the City, Nawab Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n, together with Ghazanfar Husain Kh\u0101n and a son of Muhammad Taqi Kh\u0101n, (both of whom were his sons-in-law), and with Mir Muhammad B\u0101qir Kh\u0101n, Mirza Muhammad Iraj Kh\u0101n, Mir K\u0101mil, Mir Gad\u0101i, Mir Haidar Sh\u0101h, Mir Diler Sh\u0101h, Baji Singh, R\u0101jah Ghandarab Singh, Shamsh\u012br Kh\u0101n Qurishi, (Faujd\u0101r of Silhat), Shuj\u0101 Quli Kh\u0101n, (Faujd\u0101r of the port of Hugli), Mir \u1e24abib, Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n Faujd\u0101r, Mard\u0101n A'li Kh\u0101n (the late Shuj\u0101 Kh\u0101n's Bakhshi) and other Generals and Mansabdars and Zamin-\n\nhis throne and his life, and sounded the first faint but certain death-knell of the ancient Moslem Satrapy in Bengal, which became shorn of its semi-regal prestige with his fall.\n\n40\ndars of Bengal, marched out from the City with a large army and fire-pouring artillery, and encamped at Bahmaniah, which is two Karoh distant from Murshidabad. Marching on the second day, the Nawab reached Sarai Diwan, and marching on the third day, he encamped at Khamrah, where he mustered his army and reviewed its strength and armaments. In that the officers of Shuj'a Khan's regime were in league with Haji Ahmad, brick-bats instead of shells were discovered in the arsenal, and rubbish was found inside guns. Consequently, cashiering Shahriar Khan, the Haji's brother, who was General Superintendent of the Artillery, and making him over to the custody of his retainers, Nawab Sarfaraz Khan appointed in his place Pancho, son of Antony the Portuguese, to be General Superintendent of the Artillery. The forces of Mahabat Jang were arranged in the form of a circle from Aurangabad, at the mouth of the Suti (where the shrine of Shah Murtaza Hindi exists) to the plain of Balkatah.\n\nOn the fourth day, when the silvery-crowned King (i.e., the Sun) pranced on to the plain of the sky from his camp in the East darting forth daggers of radial lines, and the dusky Moon with thousands of its forces (i.e., stars), not finding itself a match for that unique Cavalier, hid itself behind the hills, Nawab Sarfaraz Khan, selecting an auspicious moment according to astrologers, advanced to assault the enemy. By one single assault, the troops of Mahabat Jang were thrown into panic and confusion, were set a-reeling, and were nearly routed. The Rai Raiyan, finding that the table was being turned, at this moment treacherously represented to Nawab Sarfaraz Khan that the Sun had moved right vertical to the head, and that at that sultry hour if fighting were continued, both horses and soldiers would perish, owing to excessive heat and thirst, and that therefore if that day further fightings were postponed, next morning the bitter-palated enemy could be treated to a similar bitter soup (of death)\u2014\n\nWhence will thy enemy command the strength,\nTo fight with thee?\nOwing to thy good luck,\nThe enemy's head shall be trampled upon by thy feet.\n\n1 This Rai Raiyan Diwan Alamgand, the protege and favourite of Sarfaraz Khan's father, under the false mask of loyalty, did more damage to Sarfaraz Khan's cause, than even Ali Vardi Khan and his brother Haji Ahmad. But it\nAlthough astrologers descended on the auspiciousness of that hour for fighting, and adduced arguments in proof of the incoming victory, and although his Generals insisted on continuing the battle, Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n was unmoved, and forbade by use of threats further fightings that day. Then Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n encamped on the banks of the Geriah river. Meanwhile, a letter from Mah\u0101bat Jang came avowing his loyalty, and explaining that he had come simply to pay his respects to Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n. Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n, who was quite inexperienced, on perusal of the letter, became reassured, dispensed with all precautions, foolishly released H\u0101ji A\u1e25mad, who was the root of all the disturbance, and sent him to A\u02bfli Vardi Kh\u0101n Mah\u0101bat Jang, in order to reassure the latter and to bring him over. He also sent in the H\u0101ji\u2019s company Shuj\u0101\u02be Quli Kh\u0101n and Khw\u0101jah Basant, his two special confidantes, with a view to ascertain exactly the prospects of peace and war, to gauge correctly the dispositions of A\u02bfli Vardi\u2019s Army, and then to apprise him accurately. The imprisonment of the H\u0101ji with his other relatives had plunged Mah\u0101bat Jang into a whirlpool of confusion. He had apprehended that they would be slain, and had, therefore, hesitated to offer battle. Viewing the release of the H\u0101ji to be auspicious, nay as the first augury of victory, Mah\u0101bat Jang (A\u02bfli Vardi) enclosed in a casket a brick, giving out it contained the Holy Qoran, held it in his hand, and swore by it that next morning he would with folded hands present himself before Naw\u0101b Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n, and would sue for pardon for his misconduct. At the same time he presented two hundred gold coins to Khw\u0101jah Basant. These idiots (Shuj\u0101\u02be Quli Kh\u0101n and Khw\u0101jah Basant), not fathoming the water under the grass, returned happy and jolly, and describing to Naw\u0101b Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n the loyal disposition of A\u02bfli Vardi Kh\u0101n cooled the fire of his wrath. Naw\u0101b Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n then ordered his butler to prepare dainty dishes for a banquet, sat re-assured on the bed of comfort, nay slumbered the sleep of insecurity on the bed of sleep (which is akin to death); and his soldiers, intoxicated by the inebriation of the wine-cup of peace, let go from their hands the reins of watch and alertness.\n\nAye! It is sheer folly to rely on the cajolery of thy enemy:\nThe seeming prostration of floods undermines walls!\n\nis due to Diw\u0101n Alamghand\u2019s memory to add that he was only one of the faithless out of a faithless herd.\nAfter the withdrawal of Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n's emissaries, A\u02bfli Vardi Kh\u0101n soothed and won over his officers by promising them two months' pay in the event of his victory, and also by promising them the booty that might be captured. He thus incited and instigated them to fight, and distributed shells, gunpowder and armaments. The Generals of Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n's army who from before were in league with A\u02bfli Vardi Kh\u0101n, were all ready for treachery and regicide. The only exceptions were Mu\u1e25ammad Gh\u0101na Kh\u0101n and Mir Sharfu-d-d\u012bn, Commanders of the vanguard of Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n's army, who were posted at the ford of the river Geriah.\n\nAscertaining through messengers and spies the secret plot of treachery that was hatching, both the above Generals at midnight hastened to Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n, apprised the latter of the fire of treachery that was fanning under a straw-covering, and offered by way of precaution to remove him that night to their own camp, and there to guard him, and next morning to sacrifice their lives by fighting gallantly round him. In that in matters of destiny, efforts are helpless, and the knot of Fate cannot be untied with the nail of Efforts, the will of Providence cast the quicksilver of heedlessness into the ear of Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n. Placing no reliance on their loyal representation, Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n treated those two Generals in a rude and threatening manner, and by way of censure added:\n\n\"You opening a shop of self-aggrandisement desire that I should be involved in war against Mah\u0101bat Jang, who is my well-wisher.\"\n\nThose two Generals got up blushing with shame and humiliation, and returned to their own camps. Arming themselves, along with their forces, they passed the night in alertness; whilst Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n, in the slumber of heedlessness, lay intoxicated with the wine of sleep. At the instigation of Haji Ahmad, in the dead of night, under the pretext of visiting relations and friends, the officers and soldiers of Mah\u0101bat Jang's army, with their light baggages, by ones and twos, mingled with the army of Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n, and forming rings round the Royal tent looked out for an opportunity to strike.\n\nThe officers of Shuj\u0101 Kh\u0101n's regime, upon whom Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n placed great reliance, from the very beginning were in intrigue with the Haji, and seeing and knowing all connived at and concealed the conspiracy; whilst the loyal adherents of Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n held their tongue from fear of being snubbed. Whilst one hour of the night yet remained, A\u02bfli Vardi Kh\u0101n and\nHaji Ahmad divided their forces into two divisions. They detailed one division under the command of Nandlal Jama'dar, together with the standard and the kettle-drum, and flags and elephants, to attack Ghang Khan and Mir Sharfu-d-din, whilst with another division, consisting of Afgh\u0101n and Bhaliah troops, in the darkness of the night, under the guidance of the men of the Zamind\u0101ri of Ramakant, Zamind\u0101r of Rajshahi, they themselves marched to deliver a night-attack against Sarfar\u0101z Khan. And towards the day-break, whilst yet the darkness of the night continued, and friends could not be distinguished from foes, they suddenly, like death, attacked Sarfar\u0101z Khan's troops who were inebriated with the wine of sleep, (which is akin to death), and fired their guns. The old proteges awoke Sarfar\u0101z Khan from his slumber of neglect, and apprised him of the aspect of affairs. As fortune, however, had averted its face from him, even now Sarfar\u0101z Khan refused to listen to them with the ear of credence, snubbed them, and again insisted on the quick preparation of viands for a banquet. Sarfar\u0101z Khan added, \"Ali Vardi Khan is coming to visit me.\" At this moment, another cannon-shell fell; and by the time of the sunrise, the troops of Mah\u0101bat Jang exhibited themselves in battle-array. Guns and rockets, arrows and muskets flashing lightning, and showering destruction poured in. The troops of Sarfar\u0101z Khan who were intoxicated by the wine of the morning sleep, harum-scarum sprang up from their beds of slumber, and girding up their loins fled; whilst others, not commanding the nerve to gird up their loins or to arm themselves, were butchered. Sarfar\u0101z Khan's army was panic-stricken.\n\nYou might say, from dread of that warfare,\nEarth itself had fled.\n\nOnly one solitary column consisting mostly of Sarfar\u0101z Khan's old officers, impelled by sentiments of honour, and animated by a sense of loyalty, arrayed themselves on the battle-field, gallantly re-\n\n1 Sarfar\u0101z Khan possessed a most guileless soul, and his guilelessness and his confidence in Ali Vardi cost him his throne. Sarfar\u0101z Khan lacked insight into human character, which is one of the essential attributes of a wise ruler. Whilst noting this failing in Sarfar\u0101z Khan, it must be added there is nothing to condone or extenuate the black ingratitude and treachery of Ali Vardi and the Triumvirate Councillors, Dewan Alamchand, Haji Ahmad and Jagatset, who were all proteges of Sarfar\u0101z Khan's father.\nsolved to sacrifice their lives, and firmly stood their ground. Naw\u0101b Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n, after finishing his morning-prayer, also armed himself, seized the Holy Qoran with one hand, and mounted a swift elephant. Then letting loose the royal elephant in front of himself, he flung himself into the thick of the fight, and commenced shooting arrows. The Afghan generals of Mah\u0101bat Jang's army, covered by a squadron of Bhaliah infantry, charged Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n's army.\n\nWhen on both sides, the troops stood in battle-array,\nYou might say, the Day of Judgment had arrived.\nOwing to the thundering of guns, muskets and rockets,\nAye, the Universe itself quaked.\nThe twang of bow-strings and the cracking of arrows\nResounded aloft their echo to the lofty sky.\nThe spear, like Death with out-stretched hands,\nIn the taking of life, chopped the breast into slips.\nIn the hands of heroes, sharp steel-made swords,\nIn shedding blood of the enemy, leapt warmly:\nThe heroes became warm in taking and in giving life;\nAye, the world became emptied of heroes.\n\nIn this sword-charge, wherein the boisterous wind of Death threw down on the plain of annihilation corpses like leaves of trees, and the flood of blood raged tumultuously on every side, Mard\u0101n A'li Kh\u0101n, the Bakhshi of Shuj\u0101 Kh\u0101n's regime, who was now the generalissimo of Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n's army, and commanded the van, feeling himself incapable of continuing the contest any longer, fled. At the sight of this flight, Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n's army was demoralised, and a general stampede ensued in its ranks.\n\nEach one felt contented with saving himself,\nNo one cared for another.\n\nSave and except his Georgian and Abyssinian slaves and a few of his old comrades, not one out of the numerous mock-heroes remained to cover Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n's elephant. The elephant-driver perceiving that victory had declared itself for the enemy, said to Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n:\u2014\"If it be your Highness's pleasure, I shall carry you to Birbh\u016bm to the Zamind\u0101r, Badi'u-z-zam\u0101n.\" Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n, striking the elephant-driver a blow on the neck, retorted: \"Tie the chain round the feet of the elephant, as I will not retreat before\nthese dogs.\" The elephant-driver was obliged to drive on his elephant. The Bargand\u0101zes and the Bhal\u012b\u0101hs of the enemy's Army, who had from before ranged themselves like a ring round Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n's tent, discharged from all sides cannon-shells on his elephant; and over and above, rockets and cannon-balls, arrows and muskets were showered incessantly by the hostile army. Mir Gad\u0101l, who was a special favourite of Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n, was shot down by a rocket. Mir K\u0101mil, brother of Mir Muhammad B\u0101qir surnamed B\u0101qir A\u02bfli Kh\u0101n (nephew of Shuj\u0101\u02bfu-d-daulah), and a young unmarried boy of Mirz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad Ir\u0101j Kh\u0101n Bakhshi, and other personal attendants, including Bahr\u0101m, Sa\u02bfid and other slaves, who had not fled from the battle-field, were hit by rockets, cannon-shells and bullets, and fell right in front of Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n's elephant. Mirz\u0101 Ir\u0101j Kh\u0101n was also mortally wounded. Mir Diler A\u02bfli gallantly attacked the Afghan column of A\u02bfli Vardi Kh\u0101n, exhibited feats of prowess and bravery, but receiving sword-cuts gallantly fell with a number of his comrades.\n\nAt this moment, Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n himself was hit on the forehead by the bullet of a gun shot by a traitor from his own camp, and was felled on his elephant-litter, and the bird of his soul flew to Heaven. As soon as they saw this mishap, Mir Habib, Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n, Shamshir Kh\u0101n Qur\u0101ishi (Faujd\u0101r of Silhat) and R\u0101jah Ghandrab Singh, who with their forces stood aloof at a distance from the battle, and were silent spectators of the scene, took to their heels. Mir Haidar Sh\u0101h and Khw\u0101jah Basant who clung to each other, and were hiding themselves in a Rath, fled without even casting a glance at the corpse of their master.\n\nNot one out of his companions remained,\nTo guard him for an instant.\n\nIn the cover of the darkness of the night, and deceived by the ruse of the Royal Standard and the Elephant being displayed by the Division under Nandl\u0101l Jama\u1e0d\u0101r, Gh\u0101ng Kh\u0101n and Mir\n\n---\n\n1 Though exceptionally humane and forbearing in disposition, it is refreshing to note Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n could fight and fall bravely like a hero.\n2 The word used is \u0645\u06cc\u06a9\u0647 \u0644\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0631 (Mikkah Dambar), which means a royal litter, carried on elephants. It is called Mik Dambar (\u0645\u06cc\u06a9 \u0644\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0631) in the Seiru-l-Mutakkerin (p. 378) which explains its significance. It is possibly a Turkish word.\n3 A four-wheeled carriage; whilst Chakrah is a two-wheeled carriage.\nSharfuddin mistook the latter for Mah\u0101batjang, and commenced fighting. By means of Rustam-like onslaughts and brave assaults, they killed Nandl\u0101l, and cut him up with their swords. Routing those who escaped the sword, they captured the Standard, kettle-drum, elephants, camels, horses and armaments, and then they marched swiftly to enquire about Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n. Though Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n had fallen, on seeing those two brave Generals, Mah\u0101bat Jang did not stir from the field, but with his force which was more numerous than ants and locusts remained stationary and motionless on the battle-field. Those two Generals had yet received no tidings of the fall of Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n, and, therefore, with a small force of veteran heroes comprising their sons, brothers, kinsmen and companions, they bravely spurred on their chargers, fiercely assaulted Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n's army, broke through its ranks, and heroically dashed up to its centre. The army of Mah\u0101bat Jang was about to reel from the blows of those lions of the forest of warfare, when Ghaus Kh\u0101n received on the breast mortal wounds from the bullets of Chidan Haz\u0101r\u012b's musketeers, and fell. Ghaus Kh\u0101n's two sons, Qu\u1e6db and Babar, who were veritable tigers of the forest of bravery, and who on hunting-grounds were wont to slay lions with swords, unsheathed their swords, and killed a large number of Afgh\u0101ns and Bhali\u0101hs.\n\nThey attacked no one whom they did not finish,\nThey struck no head which they did not hurl down.\nOn whomever they struck their long-piercing daggers,\nHis head came down rolling from the shoulder.\n\nChidan Haz\u0101r\u012b also received sword-cuts at their hands. After much slaughter and daring, being hit by the bullets of muskets, Qu\u1e6db and Babar fell like brave martyrs, and joined their gallant father in his journey to Eternity. Mir Sharfu-d-din with seven brave cavaliers galloped right up to Mah\u0101bat Jang, and with great agility shot at the latter's breast a heart-piercing arrow, which, however, grazed against the bow of Mah\u0101bat Jang, and piercing through lodged itself in the latter's side-ribs. Mir Sharfu-d-din had pulled another arrow towards the bow-string, when Sh\u0101ikh Jah\u0101n Y\u0101r and Muhammad Zulfiq\u0101r, Mah\u0101bat Jang's Generals, who were old friends of the Mir, came forward and said: \"Naw\u0101b Safar\u0101z Kh\u0101n has fallen, what can you gain\n\n1 It would seem the race of heroes was not yet extinct in Moslem Bengal.\nnow by continuing the contest and sacrificing your life\"? The Mir bravely replied: \"Hitherto I fought from a sense of loyalty for the salt I had eaten, and from a sense of comradeship, but now I fight to maintain my honour.\" These two Generals stood sureties for the security of his honour, and pulled him back. Then the Mir with his followers set out for Birbh\u00fcm. Notwithstanding that his gunners had run away, Pancho Ferengi, Superintendent of Sarfaraz Khan's artillery, served his guns and bravely stuck to them, and kept up an incessant cannonade. After Mir Sharfu-d-din's withdrawal, the Afghans in large numbers attacked Pancho, and killed him. Baji Singh, a Rajput General, who with the rear-guard was at Khamrah, on receiving news of his master's fall, felt his sense of honour aroused. Alone spurring on his horse and placing his spear on his horse's right ear, by brave onslaughts, he dashed through the enemy's force to a point where Mahabat Jang stood. With one stroke of his sharp spear, Baji Singh attempted to hurl the latter down from his elephant-saddle and to despatch him to the next world, to be a companion there of his fallen master. Mahabat Jang made him out on seeing his heroism and agility, and ordered Danur Quli Khan, superintendent of the artillery, to quickly oppose him. Danur Quli Khan encountering him shot a bullet through his breast, and Baji Singh being mortally wounded fell on the ground. Zalim Singh, Baji Singh's son, aged nine years, with that inherent bravery which is characteristic of the Rajput race, unsheathed his sword from the scabbard, and stood up to guard his father. People from all sides surrounded him like a ring. Nawab Mahabat Jang, on seeing the daring of that boy, applauded him, and forbade the people from killing him.\n\n1 Such instances of isolated loyalty and heroism relieve, to some extent, the darkness of the picture of faithlessness and treachery that these events portray.\n\n2 \"The ravenous hordes thus let loose on India made the race-name of Christian (Ferengi) a word of terror, until the strong rule of the Mughal Empire turned it into one of contempt.\"\u2014Sir W. Hunter's History of British India, Vol. I, p. 184. The name 'Ferengi' was, however, more especially applied to the Portuguese settlers in India, whilst the term 'Nasara' (or Nazarene) was a generic term for all Christians.\n\n3 It is an eloquent testimony to the goodness of Sarfaraz Khan, that even in those treacherous times, and in such a trying crisis, he could command the undying devotion and homage of his brave Rajput officers. This is another incident which relieves, in some measure, the darkness of the picture presented by these scenes.\nand ordered them not to oppose the removal of his father's corpse. The artillery-men helped in the removal of B\u0101j\u012b Singh's corpse, and carried along with it Z\u0101l\u012bm Singh on their shoulders. During the fightings of Ghans Kh\u0101n, Mir Sharfu-d-din, B\u0101j\u012b Singh and Pancho Ferengi, both the sons-in-law of Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n, named Ghazanfar Husain and Hasan Mu\u1e25ammad, together with other Mansabd\u0101rs and vanquished soldiers, had fled from the battle-field, and had in one day marched back to Murshid\u0101b\u0101d. And the Rai R\u0101i\u0101n Alamghand, by way of retribution for his treachery, received an arrow-shot on the hand from a cross-bow, plunged into the river, and half-dead reached his house. Repenting of his disloyal treachery, he committed suicide by swallowing diamond-filings. In short, when Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n was felled on his elephant-litter, the elephant-driver carried his corpse swiftly to Murshid\u0101b\u0101d. Y\u0101s\u012bn Kh\u0101n, Faujd\u0101r of Murshid\u0101b\u0101d, who together with H\u0101fi\u1e93u-l-lah Kh\u0101n, son of Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n, had been left to guard the City, the Citadel and the Naw\u0101b's family, buried at midnight the corpse of Naw\u0101b Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n at Naktakhali. H\u0101fi\u1e93u-l-lah and Ghazanfar Husain hurriedly threw up entrenchments, and prepared to fight. They, however, received no encouragement from the vanquished troops, and therefore abandoned their plan of fighting, and tendered their submission to Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n. This Revolution in the Government threw the City, as well as the Army and the people of Bengal, into a general and deep convulsion.

He was a Machiavellian diplomatist, and therefore, the first step he took on his entry into the city, was to sue for pardon for his treachery from Na\u1e63\u012bs Begam, a daughter of Shuj\u0101'u-d-din Kh\u0101n, and sister of Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n. He next held a Darbar in the Chehel Satun palace of Shuj\u0101'u-d-din Kh\u0101n, and though at first he was detested by the people and the officers for his black ingratitude and treachery, he soon managed to conciliate them by bestowing on them rich largesses. (See Seiru-l-Mutakkerin, Pers. text, p. 494). He appointed in his place as Naib Nasim of Patna (Azimabad) his son-in-law, Zainu-d-din Kh\u0101n Haibat Jang.

Yasin Khan Faujdar, under the order of the Hajji, set guards on Sarfaraz Khan's treasury and family, officers and servants, as well as on his Seraglio, so that none could escape. This battle\\(^1\\) of Gheria took place in 1153 A.H.\n\n---\n\n**NIZAMAT OF NAWAB ALI VARDI KHAN MAHABAT JANG.**\n\nAfter obtaining victory, Ali Vardi Khan Mahabat Jang, in order to overlook the sacking of the City and the loot of Sarfaraz Khan's treasures at the hands of Afghans and Bhaliyas,\\(^2\\) for three days encamped outside the City, on the banks of the river Gobrah. On the fourth day, with a sense of perfect security entering the Citadel, he seated himself with extended thighs on the mausoleum of the Nizamat of Bengal, and confiscated without any trouble Sarfaraz Khan's treasures which the past Nazims with considerable self-denial had hoarded. In that Nawab Mahabat Jang avoided the company of strange women, and did not care for this sort of pleasure, during his life he had only one wedded wife, and in fact, he often plumed himself on this circumstance. Hajji Ahmad and his sons and relations possessed themselves of Sarfaraz Khan's fifteen hundred pretty female dependants and slaves. Mahabat Jang banished to Jahangirnagar (Dacca) the wedded Begams of Sarfaraz Khan with their children,\\(^3\\) and fixed small allowances for them from the income of the Khass Taluqah.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Compare the description of this battle with that given in the *Seirul-Mutakkerin*, pp. 492-493. The author of the *Seir*, though a strong partisan of Ali Vardi, and though anxious to gloss over his treachery and ingratitude, is forced to pay a glowing tribute to the bravery and devoted courage displayed by several officers of Sarfaraz Khan at this battle. *Riyas'* account of this important battle seems much richer in details, as well as more graphic and more exact than that of the *Seir*. This important battle took place about 11 months after Nadir Shah's return to Persia after the sack of Delhi, and about 14 months after Shuja'ud-din Khan's death.\n\n\\(^2\\) This fact which redounds to the discredit of Ali Vardi Khan is suppressed by the author of the *Seirul-Mutakkerin*, whose father was employed in a high capacity under Ali Vardi's son-in-law, Zainuddin Khan, at Patna. The author of the *Riyas*, not being a partisan, does not suppress it.\n\n\\(^3\\) It may be interesting to inquire if any descendants of these still survive in the alleys of Dacca.\nAnd Nafisah Begam, Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n's sister, who had adopted as her child Aq\u0101 B\u0101b\u0101 K\u016bshak who was her nephew, entered service as a governess in the Seraglio of Nawazish Ahmad Kh\u0101n,\u00b9 the eldest son of H\u0101ji Ahmad, and in this way supported her nephew.\n\nWhen news of the fall of Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n and of the succession of Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n to the Masnad of the Niz\u0101mat of Bengal reached Emperor N\u0101siru-d-din Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u0101h, the latter wept and said: \"Owing to Nad\u012br Sh\u0101h, the whole of my Empire is convulsed and shattered.\"\u00b2 But to mend the state of affairs was difficult, and so the Emperor kept quiet. Mah\u0101bat Jang, through Mur\u0101d Kh\u0101n,\u00b3 who was one of the associates of the Prime Minister, Naw\u0101b Qamru-d-din Kh\u0101n (about whom mention has been made before), intrigued with the Prime Minister and other Ministers. He remitted to the Emperor forty laks of rupees on account of Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n's confiscated treasures and fourteen laks on account of tribute, over and above the usual fixed revenue. He also gave three laks of rupees to Qamru-d-din Kh\u0101n Vaz\u012br, and one lak of rupees to Asaf Jah Ni\u1e93\u0101mu-l-Mulk. He similarly conciliated and bribed other Imperial Officers according to their ranks. Intriguing with Rajah Jugal Kishor, agent of Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n, Mah\u0101bat Jang obtained in his own name the patent of the Niz\u0101mat of all the three S\u016bbahs of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa, according to the usual practice. He then exacted double the usual\n\n\u00b9 He was then Deputy Nagin of Jahangirnagar or Dacca.\n\u00b2 Emperor Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u0101h was not quite fair to Nad\u012br Sh\u0101h in his political diagnosis. He ought to have added, the glorious Timuride Empire in India had been shattered and undermined by the luxury and love of ease, and patricidal jealousies and strifes of himself and his immediate predecessors, and principally by the venality and corruption, joined to clannish jealousies and personal ambitions that had seized the later Mughal ministers and pro-consuls. A moral paralysis had seized the heart of the Empire at Delhi, and it quickly extended to and affected its distant limbs in outlying Provinces. The Musalmans in India had lost their Islamic virtues first, and next their Empire; whilst Nad\u012br Sh\u0101h's terrible invasion operated only as an accelerating force towards its eventual dissolution.\n\u00b3 He had been deputed by the Emperor to bring the attached treasures of Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n, and the revenue of Bengal. See Seir, p. 496.\n\u2074 It is humiliating to observe that even ministers of the calibre and position of Qamru-d-din Kh\u0101n and Ni\u1e93\u0101mu-l-Mulk Asaf Jah were, at this dark period of Indo-Moslem History, not above corruption.\namount of revenue, presents and tribute from the Zamind\u0101rs of Bengal.\n\nFor the purpose of overthrowing Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n,\u00b9 and for conquering the S\u016bbah of Od\u012bsah (Orissa), Mah\u0101bat Jang now girded up his loins, mobilised troops and collected armaments, and bestowed the office of Generalissimo on Mir Ja\u02bffar Kh\u0101n Bah\u0101dur, who was Mah\u0101bat Jang\u2019s brother-in-law, and who in the war with Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n had rendered Mah\u0101bat Jang good services. Mah\u0101bat Jang bestowed on Mir Ja\u02bffar a corps of bodyguard, together with a mansab, a title, and a peerage. He bestowed the office of Diw\u0101n with the title of R\u0101i Rai\u0101n on Ch\u012bn R\u0101i,\u00b2 who was a clerk in charge of the J\u0101girs of Ja\u02bffar Kh\u0101n, and who was a person of probity and honesty. And he bestowed on Mu\u1e25ammad Riz\u0101 Kh\u0101n, the eldest son of \u1e24\u0101ji A\u1e25mad, who had married Ghasiti Kh\u0101nam, daughter of Mah\u0101bat Jang, the title of N\u0101siru-l-Mulk Ihtish\u0101mu-d-daulah Naw\u0101zish Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n Bah\u0101dur Shah\u0101mat Jang, together with the nominal office of Diw\u0101n of Bengal, and the Deputy Niz\u0101mat of Jah\u0101ngirnagar (Dacca), including Chittagong, Raushanabad (Tipperah), and Silhat. And he bestowed on\n\n\u00b9 He was a son-in-law of Shuj\u0101\u02bfu-d-d\u012bn Kh\u0101n, and had been appointed by the latter Deputy Nazim of Orissa, on the death of Mu\u1e25ammad Taq\u012b Kh\u0101n (a son of Shuj\u0101\u02bfu-d-d\u012bn Kh\u0101n). Ali Vardi and his unholy \u1e24\u0101ji brother were resolved to spare no one amongst the capable male representatives of their late master and benefactor. A reign ushered in by such treachery and characterised by such vindictive posthumous courtesies was bound, under an Avenging Providence, to terminate ignominiously. The unholy \u1e24\u0101ji brother quickly met with his proper deserts, by being tortured and butchered, along with his son Zainu-d-d\u012bn Kh\u0101n, by the Afghan rabble who sacked Patna. Ali Vardi himself was continually distracted and harassed by Mahratta freebooters, who swooped down again and again on his fair provinces like armies of locusts, and harried and devastated them, and Ali Vardi\u2019s energy, courage, and prowess were of no avail against this visitation of God\u2019s curse. He at length had to conclude an inglorious peace with the Mahrattas, and to practically cede to the latter the Province of Orissa. And not many months had rolled away since he had closed his eyes, when his favourite grandson, Siraju-d-daulah, was tortured to death, and Ali Vardi\u2019s ill-gotten Satrapy dissolved for ever, and was transferred to other hands. Verily, Divine retribution was not slow in overtaking Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n.\n\n\u00b2 Ch\u012bn Rai was the Peshkar under the Diwan Alam Chand. Mah\u0101bat Jang, on Alam Chand\u2019s death, appointed Ch\u012bn Rai as his Diwan. (See Seir, p. 495). Ch\u012bn Rai proved very honest, and was held in high esteem by Mah\u0101bat Jang. (See Seir, p. 575).\nH\u0101shim Ali Kh\u0101n, the youngest son of H\u0101ji Ahmad, who had married the younger daughter of Mah\u0101bat Jang, named Amanah Kh\u0101nam, the title of Zainu-d-din Ahmad Kh\u0101n Haibat Jang, together with the Deputy Niz\u0101mat of the Province of Bih\u0101r and Azim\u0101b\u0101d (Patna). And he advanced to ranks, titles, and Jagirs his other relations and connexions, according to their ranks and aspirations. But the Afgh\u0101ns and the Bhaliyas, who owing to their large numbers were haughty, meddled so much in all the affairs, that they did not care for Mah\u0101bat Jang, and deviated from the usual forms of etiquette. Shelving the canons of justice on the shelf of forgetfulness, they looted treasures, and killed and slaughtered the people, together with their women and children. And the conduct of ingratitude, which had subsisted in the times of the early Musalman Independent Kings of Bengal, reasserted itself afresh from the time of Mah\u0101bat Jang.\n\n1 The following details of the administrative arrangements made by Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n on his usurpation of the Niz\u0101mat of Bengal, are summarised briefly from the Seiru-Mutakherin, p. 496. Zainu-d-din Ahmad Kh\u0101n, Ali Vardi's youngest son-in-law, was appointed Subedar of Behar and Patna. The Deputy Niz\u0101mat of Jahangirnagar, including the Faujdari of Silhat, Chittagong, and Tipperah, was given to his eldest son-in-law, Nawas\u012bsh Muhammad Kh\u0101n. The Deputy Niz\u0101mat of Orissa was bestowed on his second son-in-law, Said Ahmad Kh\u0101n (after Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n was defeated). The Superintendentship of the Nawarah or Imperial Fleet at Jahangirnagar (Dacca) was bestowed on his grandson, Mirza Muhammad (son of Zainu-d-din Ahmad Kh\u0101n) surnamed Siraju-d-daulah Sh\u0101h Quli Kh\u0101n Bahadur. Siraju-d-daulah's brother was adopted as a son by Nawas\u012bsh Muhammad Kh\u0101n, and surnamed \"Ikramu-d-daulah Padshah Quli Kh\u0101n Bahadur\" with nominal command of the Jahangirnagar or Dacca army. Atau-l-lah Kh\u0101n, a son-in-law of H\u0101ji Ahmad (Ali Vardi's brother) was appointed Faujd\u0101r of Rajmahal (Akbarnagar) and Bhagalpur. Alah Yar Kh\u0101n (step-brother of Ali Vardi), Mir Jafar Kh\u0101n (brother-in-law of Ali Vardi), and his other connexions like Faquiru-l-lah Beg Kh\u0101n, Nural-lah Beg Kh\u0101n and Mustafa Kh\u0101n were given mansabs and peerages with titles and body-guards. Chin Rai (Peshkar under Diwan Alamgir) received the title of 'Rai Raian,' and was appointed Deputy Diwan of Bengal. Rajah Janaki Ram, who was the old household Diwan of Mah\u0101bat Jang, was appointed Diwan of Miscellaneous departments. The Seir's author's maternal uncle or Khaloo, Abdul Ali Kh\u0101n (who was also a connexion of Ali Vardi), received a mansab, together with the parganas of Narhat Samai and Behar.\n\n2 For its revival, Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n Mah\u0101bat Jang was himself responsible. He re-inaugurated an era of force and fraud, and he and his successors were paid back in the same coin by others. He taught the lesson of ingrat-\nTowards the commencement of the insurrection of Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n Mah\u0101bat Jang, Naw\u0101b Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n had asked for help from Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n, the Governor of Odisah (Orissa), who was his brother-in-law; but the latter, owing to personal spite which has been referred to before, had delayed to march to his help. Whilst Murshid Quli was occupied with despatching a body of troops in the shape of an auxiliary force, he suddenly received news of Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n's fall and of Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n's mastery over the \u0160\u0101bah of Bengal. It was then that Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n woke up from slumber, and was plunged into shame and sorrow.\n\nGeneral well-being follows mutual union,\u00b9\n\nGeneral ruin follows disunion.\n\nIn short, from fear of Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n, Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n made preparations in self-defence, and exerted himself strenuously towards the mobilisation of an army, and deputed to Murshid\u0101-b\u0101d Mukh\u0101l\u012bs Ali Kh\u0101n, son-in-law of H\u0101ji Ahmad, who from before was in his company, in order to arrange the basis of a treaty of peace. After the latter's arrival, Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n and H\u0101ji Ahmad sending a reassuring and diplomatic message to Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n, set him at ease,\u00b2 and sent back Mukh\u0101l\u012bs Kh\u0101n, in order to sow treason secretly amongst the Officers of Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n's army. Mukh\u0101l\u012bs Kh\u0101n presenting himself before Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n outwardly tried to humour and reassure him, but covertly by offer of allurements and temptations sowed sedition in Murshid Quli's army, and sent an account of his success in this direction to Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n Mah\u0101bat Jang. The latter, with a large army and an immense artillery, instantly marched towards the Province of Orissa. On receipt of this news, leaving his wife, Durd\u0101nah Begam, and his son, Yahy\u0101 Kh\u0101n,\n\n\u00b9 The Persian couplet is:\n\n\u062f\u0648\u062a \u0647\u0645\u0647 \u0632 \u0646\u0641\u0627\u0642 \u062e\u06cc\u0632\u062f\n\u0628\u06cc\u062f\u0648\u0644\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u0646\u0641\u0627\u0642 \u062e\u06cc\u0632\u062f\n\n\u00b2 Ali Vardi and his worthy H\u0101ji brother could never lay down their favourite weapon of treachery, and well were they, through their children, repaid in the same coin by Mir Ja\u02bffar and others.\nwith his treasures in the fort of Barahb\u0101ti,\u00b9 Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n with an efficient force and requisite war-paraphernalia, together with his two sons-in-law, named Mirz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad B\u0101qir\u00b2 Kh\u0101n, a Prince of Persia, and Al\u0101u-d-d\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n, marched out from Katak (Cuttack) in order to fight, and advanced to the port of Balis\u0101r (Balasor). At the ferry of Phulw\u0101r, from the rock of Tilgadhi\u00b3 he threw up an entrenchment, and remained behind it waiting for the enemy.\u2074 Unfortunately, Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n was ignorant of the wiles of the traitor in his own camp in the person of Mukh\u0101l\u012bs Ali Kh\u0101n, and had, therefore, failed to take any precautionary steps against that double-faced scoundrel, and had thus ignored the saying of Shaikh Sa\u2019di\u2075:\n\n\u00b9 \u201cThe construction of Fort Barabati has been assigned to various monarchs with various dates. Sterling thinks it was built by R\u0101jah Anang Bhem Deva in the fourteenth century. The stonework has been taken by the Public Works Department to build lighthouses and hospitals, and to pave roads. The ditch of the fort, however, still remains, and so does the gate, which is still approached by a causeway... R\u0101jah Mukund Deo built a palace here with nine courts... The palace was in time abandoned by the Musalman Governors who preferred to live in the Lalbagh, on the south side of the city, (now Commissioner\u2019s Residence\u201d)\u2014Wilson\u2019s Early Annals of the English in Bengal, Vol. I, p. 4, f. n.\n\n\u00b2 There is still a mahalla or quarter in Katak, called \u2018Bakrabad,\u2019 named so, probably, after B\u0101qir Kh\u0101n.\n\n\u00b3 Tilgadhi in the text is apparently a mistake for the hill \u2018Tahirmunda\u2019 marked on the maps of Orissa, near Balasore.\n\n\u2074 \u2018Jon\u2019 in the text is also obviously a mistake; I do not find any river of that name near Balasore or in Orissa. It is a mistake probably for the river near Balasore, called \u2018Nuniajuri,\u2019 Balasore itself being situated on the Burabalung river.\n\n\u2075 In Seiru-l-Mutakkerin (p. 497), it is stated Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n passed through Balasore port, and encamped on the banks of its river, in the Mouza of Bhalwar. The encampment is described in the Seir as being flanked by dense forests on one side, and by deep rivulets on another. A ring with artillery was formed round this encampment. Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n passing through Mednipur and Jalasore, took up a position on the north banks of the Burabalung river. The position taken up by Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n is described as very impregnable, and he might not have been dislodged from it, but for the rash sally of his son-in-law, Mirz\u0101 Baqir Ali Kh\u0101n, and the treachery of his Afghan General, \u2018Abid Kh\u0101n, who deserted Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n, his old master and benefactor, and joined with his Afghan contingent Mustafa Kh\u0101n, the Afghan General of Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n. The crafty Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n had by means of bribes sown treason amongst the Afghan troops of Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n (497 Seir).\n\n\u2076 The well-known Persian poet and moralist.\n'If thy relative be thy enemy, treat him outwardly as thy friend,\nBut never be heedless of his treachery.\nFor inside his heart, wound festers from thy envy,\nWhenever he thinks of the love-shackles of kinship.'\n\nAdvancing from Bengal by forced marches with a large army, which numbered more than one lakh cavalry and infantry, Ali Vardi Khan reached Mednipur, secured the adhesion of the Zamindars of that district by bestowing on them Khilats and gifts, and encamped at Jaliser (Jalasore), which was an Imperial outpost. On the banks of the river Sabaurikha,\u00b9 at the ferry of Rajghat, Raja Jagardhar Bhanj, Zamindar of Morbhanj,\u00b2 had established a garrison of his Chawars and Khandaites, and had erected entrenchments. To cross, therefore, at the ferry of Rajghat which was protected by dense jungles and thorny trees, was found to be a difficult operation, and therefore, Ali Vardi Khan had to ask for help from the Raja. The Raja, however, was haughty owing to his command of a large army, and did not care for Ali Vardi Khan. He refused to side with the latter, or to permit him to cross at the Rajghat ferry. Ali Vardi Khan placing his artillery-waggons in front of the Rajghat ferry, commenced bombarding it. The Raja's army were unable to hold the ground in their entrenchment, and fled to the jungles. Ali Vardi Khan with troops and artillery crossed over at Rajghat, and encamped at Ramchandarpur which was at a distance of one and a half karoh from Murshid Quli Khan's encampment. Emissaries and envoys were busy for some days moving to and fro with messages of peace and war, and this sort of diplomatic parley lasted for one month. All this time Murshid Quli Khan\u00b3 did not advance across the ferry of Phulwar. Having\n\n\u00b9 This is an error in the text, or a misprint for 'Subarnarika' river, on which Jalesar or Jalasore is situated.\n\u00b2 This forms now one of the Tributary Mahals under the Commissioner of Orissa.\n\u00b3 As another interesting and remarkable illustration of the potent influence in politics and society exercised by Musalman ladies in Bengal, even towards the middle of the eighteenth century, it may be noted that Murshid Quli Khan himself was averse to fight with Ali Vardi Khan, owing to a sense of feebleness, but that his brave wife, Durdanah Begam, encouraged and inspired him to fight, in order to avenge her brother Sarfaraz Khan's fall, and threat-\nregard to the wasteful expenditure on account of a huge army thus looked up, and viewing the dearth of provisions, and apprehending the approach of the rainy season as well as the raids of Mah-ratta freebooters, Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n thought it expedient to patch up peace, and return. But Mu\u1e63\u1e6dafa Kh\u0101n, generalissimo of Ali Vardi\u2019s Afgh\u0101n contingent, not acquiescing in peace, suggested entrenchments being thrown up during the rains. After a Council of War, it was decided after much deliberation to send a soothing message to Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n through a trustworthy envoy, who was instructed to get back a reply in the following form:\u2014\u201cI shall not allow you authority or possession over the \u0160\u016bbah of Odisah,\u201d and then with this document to return to Bengal, and after the rainy season, again mobilising troops, to re-attempt Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n\u2019s subjugation. Although \u2018\u0100bid Kh\u0101n and other Afgh\u0101n Generals, owing to the sedition sown amongst them by Mukh\u0101l\u012bs Ali Kh\u0101n, treacherously advised Mirz\u0101 B\u0101qir Kh\u0101n, who commanded the vanguard of Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n\u2019s army, to give battle by advancing out of the entrenchment, Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n remained on the defensive, and dissuaded Mirz\u0101 B\u0101qir from attempting a sally. But as the period of stay within entrenchments was tediously protracted, Mirz\u0101 B\u0101qir, carried by his youthful impulsiveness, sallied out with his contingent composed of Syeds of Barha, and arrayed himself in battle-rank. Murshid Quli was, therefore, obliged to array his troops in front of Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n\u2019s army. On both sides, the battle opened with a cannonade, which was soon abandoned for a sword and spear-charge at close quarters. Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n\u2019s generalissimo, Mir Abdu-l-\u2018Aziz, who commanded the van, and his devoted contingent of three hundred knights consisting of Syeds of Barha spurred on their chargers, exhibited feats of heroism and hereditary gallantry, and with the flashing of their lightning swords ignited the life-harvests of all whose moment for death had arrived. Before this gallant charge, Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n\u2019s soldiers, who had hitherto fancied themselves lions of the forest of bravery, fled like sheep from the battle-field, and met with a crushing defeat. The elephant on which Ali\n\nened that in case her husband failed to do so, she would supplant him from the Government of Orissa, and raise to the gadi her son-in-law, Mirza B\u0101qir Ali Kh\u0101n, in his place. Thereon, Murshid Quli gave way to his wife\u2019s influence, and resolved to fight with Ali Vardi. (See Seiru-l-Mutakkerin, Pers. text, p 496).\nVardi Kh\u0101n with his Begam\\(^1\\) was mounted, was withdrawn half a farsakh away from the battle-field. At this crisis, Mukh\u0101l\u012bs Ali Kh\u0101n and \u0100bid Kh\u0101n surnamed Farzand Ali Kh\u0101n, upon whose loyalty Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n reposed implicit confidence, together with Muqarrab Kh\u0101n and other Afghan generals, exhibiting treachery which is the characteristic of the Afghan race, effaced from the tablets of their hearts all the alphabets of obligations that had been engraved thereon by many years of shelter and salt-eating, deserted the side of Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n, and retired from the battle-field.

Indeed, it is interesting to note that Ali Vardi's Begam played the role of Supreme Political Officer, whilst her husband fought the battles with the Mahrattas. It is stated in the Seiru-l-Mutakherin (Pers. text, p. 550), that one day Ali Vardi at Patna after fighting with the Mahrattas under Raghoji Bhosla, entered the Begam's boudoir with an anxious look. The Begam enquired what the matter was, when Ali Vardi replied that this time he feared treachery from his own soldiers and officers. Thereon, the Begam on her own initiative and her own responsibility organised a political mission, and sent it to Raghoji's camp, to arrange for a treaty of peace. Raghoji fell in with the proposal, but his Chief Adviser, Mir Habib, dissuaded him, and advised him to make a dash for Murshidabad, holding out the prospect of loot. The Begam must have been a lady of keen judgment and uncommon sagacity to have been relied upon at such a crisis by her shrewd husband.\n\n2 M\u0101nikhand who was afterwards left as Governor of Calcutta, when Sirajuddaulah conquered it, was a shrewd and time-serving man, and regulated his loyalty by prudential considerations. He was a prototype of Nubokishen of later times, of whose loyal assistance to the English so much has of late been made by a recent writer, but who only followed M\u0101nikhand in his loyal tactics, feeling his way cautiously, and keenly watching which way the tide of success turned, in order to adjust his individual position with an eye to self-aggrandisement. The Seir makes no mention of M\u0101nikhand having taken any part in the battle, and ascribes Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n's disaster to the treachery of his Afghan general 'Abid Kh\u0101n, and to the rash sally of his son-in-law, Mirz\u0101 B\u0101qir Ali Kh\u0101n. At this battle near Balasore, the Syeda of Barha fought bravely on the side of Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n, and several of them, such as Mir Ali Akbar and Mir Mujtaha Ali fell, whilst Mirz\u0101 B\u0101qir Ali Kh\u0101 himself was severely wounded.

From a side of the forest, towards the direction whence the force of Mirza Baqir Khan was marching in pursuit of Ali Vardi Khan, Manikchand shewed himself, and displayed Murshid Quli Khan's flag. Inasmuch as the aforesaid Mirza was unaware of his aim, he opposed his progress. Manikchand was obliged to fight. Mirza Baqir's efficient soldiers were already exhausted by warfare, so they fought in broken lines, and by the vicissitudes of times, the corps of Mirza Baqir was defeated. Ali Vardi Khan, on being apprised of this, hurriedly collected his vanquished troops by use of persuasions, and a second time engaged in fighting. Mir Abdu-l-'Aziz and his corps, consisting of three hundred Syed knights, dismounting from their horses, and girding up their loins of bravery, marched to the battle-field, and one by one, all of them fell, being shot down by bullets fired by the Bhaliah corps. Murshid Quli Khan being thus defeated retired\u00b9 to the Port of Balisar (Balsore), and there embarking on a sloop which had been kept ready from before, he sailed for the Dakhin, and presented himself before Nawab Asaf Jah.\u00b2 A providential victory thus fell to the good fortune of Ali Vardi Khan Mahabat Jang. The latter pursued the vanquished army up to the Port of Balasore. From there, he detached Mirza Khairu-l-lah Beg, Faqiru-l-lah Beg,\n\n\u00b9 It is stated in the Seir that after his defeat at the battle of Balasore, Murshid Quli Khan together with his son-in-law, Mirza Baqir Ali Khan, withdrew to the town of Balasore, with two or three thousand troops. Apprehending treachery from the latter, he gave out that he would entrench himself in the town, told them off to some distance to guard the roads leading to the town, whilst he himself with Mirza Baqir Ali moved towards the sea-shore. At this time it so happened that a friend of his, Haji Mohsin, a merchant of Surat, had his mercantile ship in the port, and also a pinnace. Murshid Quli Khan got into the pinnace along with Mirza Baqir Ali and Haji Mohsin and some servants, embarked on board the ship, which sailed down to Masulipatam. From Masulipatam, Murshid Quli Khan sent Mirza Baqir Ali towards Sikakul and Ganjam, to bring away Durdanah Begam and her daughter from Katak (Cuttack).\n\n\u00b2 Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah was Viceroy of the Dakhin under Emperor Muhammad Shah, at this time.

See note ante.\nand Nurul-lah Beg to capture Yahya Khan\u00b9 and Murshid Quli's Begam, and also to seize his treasures and chattels. Ali Vardi instructed them to proceed by forced marches, whilst he himself followed them on horse-back. When news of this affair and of Murshid Quli Khan's retreat to the Dakhin reached Katak (Cuttack), Murad Khan, the generalissimo of the Rajah\u00b2 of Parsutam (Puri), who had been detailed for guarding Yahya Khan and the Begam in the Fort of Barahbati, planned to send instantly the Begam and Yahya Khan together with all their chattels and treasures to the Dakhin, by way of Sekakul.\u00b3 Baggages and equipages were kept ready, and jewelleries, gold coins, treasures, and other precious things were loaded on elephants, camels, and waggons, when all of a sudden the army of Ali Vardi Khan made its appearance. The elephant and camel-drivers, &c., leaving behind the loaded treasures and chattels with their baggages, fled, and all those treasures fell into the hands of the aforesaid Mirzas, who divided the precious jewelleries,\n\n\u00b9 Murshid Quli Khan had left his wife Durdanah Begam and his son Yahya Khan, together with his treasures, in the Fort of Barahbati at Katak, whilst advancing to Balasore.\n\n\u00b2 The Rajah was Hafiz Qadir, a Muhammadan. See n. 3 below and Seiru-l-Mutakherin, Pers. text, p. 498.\n\n\u00b3 Sekakul or Chicacole is a place in the Ganjam district, over 100 miles south-west of Puri. The land-route from Orissa to the Dakhin lay in olden days via Sekakul or Chicacole across the Chilka lake. It is stated in the Seir that after arrival at Masulipatam, Murshid Quli Khan sent his son-in-law, Mirza Baqir Ali Khan, towards Sekakul and Ganjam, to proceed to the relief of Durdanah Begum and her daughter. In the meantime, on hearing of Murshid Quli Khan's defeat, Murshid Quli's friend, Hafiz Qadir, Rajah of Ratipur, Khurdah, who was Superintendent of the temple of Jagannath, (Note by Translator.\u2014This is an interesting and remarkable fact shewing that a Musalman was once at the head of this Hindu Temple. See Seir, Pers. text, p. 498) of his own motion had sent his general, Muhammad Murad, with a force to guard and relieve Durdanah Begum and her daughter. Murad succeeded in bringing away the Begam and her daughter with their treasures and effects to Inghapur, which is in the Ganjam district. Anwaruddin Khan, Governor of Inghapur, treated the Begams very hospitably. At this time, Mirza Baqir Ali Khan reached Inghapur, and proceeded from there with the Begams and their treasures to Masulipatam, whence Murshid Quli Khan, Mirza Baqir Ali Khan and the Begams, together with the treasures and effects, proceeded to the Dakhin and took shelter with Asif Jah, its ruler. (See Seiru-l-Mutakherin, Pers. text, p. 498).\ntreasures, and other valuable wares amongst themselves. Since Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n also followed up subsequently, he captured the remaining treasures, and also confiscated other treasures of the adherents of Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n. Issuing proclamations of peace and security, and employing reassurances and persuasions, Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n won over to his side the Collectors, Zamind\u0101rs and Officers of Orissa, and set about making settlement of the revenue, nazar, and tribute, as well as of the J\u0101girs. And in the course of one month, having finished the organisation and settlement of the S\u016bbah of Orissa, he entrusted the charge of that Province to Sa\u00efd Ahmad Kh\u0101n, his nephew, who had previously served as the Faujd\u0101r of Rangp\u016br, procuring for him from the Emperor the title of Na\u1e63\u012bru-l-Mulk Sa\u00efd Ahmad Kh\u0101n Bah\u0101dur \u0160aulat Jang. Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n also left Gujar Kh\u0101n, a Rohilla general, together with a contingent of three thousand cavalry and four thousand infantry, to be in attendance on Sa\u00efd Ahmad Kh\u0101n at Katak (Cuttack). Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n then returned, triumphant and victorious, to Bengal.\n\n\u0160aulat Jang was of a charlsh disposition and regulated himself by avarice. For effecting retrenchment in the military expenditure, he took into his service Salim Kh\u0101n, D\u0101rv\u0101sh Kh\u0101n, Nia'mat Kh\u0101n, Mir A'zizu-l-lah and other generals, and sent back Gujar Kh\u0101n to Murshid\u0101b\u0101d, on the plea of smallness of the revenue of\n\n---\n\n1 It would appear the account in the Seiru-l-Muta\u1e25\u0101erin, as regards the fate of the Begams and their treasure is somewhat different from that in the Riyas, which states that the Begams' treasures and effects were captured by Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n's officers. The Riyas is, however, strangely silent as to the fate of the Begams who were with the treasures. Obviously, the account in the Riyas is incomplete and halting, whilst that of the Seir is more consistent and comprehensive and, therefore, more acceptable.\n\n2 The account in the Seir is somewhat different from that in the Riyas. In the Seir, it is stated, in pursuance of a policy of economy, \u0160aul\u0101t Jang wanted to reduce the pay of his soldiers. This reduction in pay was resented by the Murshidabad troops and officers who in consequence were disbanded, whilst the soldiers and officers domiciled in Orissa accepted this reduced pay, and in consequence were enlisted in the army in large numbers. \u0160aul\u0101t Jang subsequently, at the instigation of one Shah Y\u0101h\u0113 indulged in debaucheries and ill-treated the men and women of Katak, who all in consequence were disgusted with him. This state of affairs at Katak came to the notice of Mirza Baqir Ali, who was in the Dakhin. The latter asked Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n to invade Orissa, but Murshid Quli demurred. Thereon, Mirza Baqir Ali himself invaded Orissa, first persuading the soldiers and residents of Katak\nKatak. The aforesaid generals who were anxious to avenge the fall of their old master, Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n, finding now an opportunity, broke out into revolt. \u0160anlat Jang sent to them Q\u0101sim B\u0113g, Superintendent of the Artillery, and Shaikh Hid\u0101itu-l-lah, Faujd\u0101r (Magistrate) of Katak, for effecting the basis of a reconciliation. The Generals, who were seeking for an opportunity, finding the above two emissaries unescorted, slew Q\u0101sim B\u0113g, whilst Hid\u0101itu-l-lah, after receiving some wounds, made his escape. The citizens and soldiers en masse broke out into revolt, and under cover of the darkness of night they besieged \u0160anlat Jang, took him prisoner along with his followers and relations, and looted his treasures and effects. Then inviting over Mirza Baqir Kh\u0101n, son-in-law of Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n, from Sikak\u016bl across the Chilikah lake, they placed him on the masnad of the Niz\u0101mat of Orissa, and advancing with their forces they conquered Mednip\u016br and Hijli.\n\nThe news of the approach of the Katak army threw Bengal into commotion. Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n, on the occurrence of this disaster, mobilised an immense army equipped with a battering artillery, and then set out for Katak, in order to relieve \u0160anlat Jang and re-conquer Orissa. By forced marches, scouring through Bardw\u0101n, he encamped on the outskirts of Mednip\u016br. On receiving news of the approach of Mah\u0101bat Jang, the Katak army, which was spread at Hijli and Mednip\u016br, concentrated at Mednip\u016br and Jaliser, next crossed over at the ferries of Rajgh\u0101t and Phulwar, and then encamped at the Port of Balasore.

The latter revolted, killed Gujar Kh\u0101n, the general, when Baqir Ali marched swiftly to Katak, imprisoned \u0160anlat Jang, together with his wife and children in the Fort of Barahbati, and installed himself on the gadi of Orissa.

I consider makes the text unintelligible, and \u06cc of the MSS. text is correct. According to the latter reading, I have translated the text.\n\n2 See the account in the Seir (Pers. text pp. 503-505) of Ali Vardi\u2019s expedition to Katak, to relieve \u0160anlat Jang. It is stated in the Seir that Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n apprehending that Mirza Baqir Ali Kh\u0101n was being helped by Asif Jah from the Dakhin, marched to Katak with a huge army, consisting of twenty thousand soldiers, led by picked generals and officers, such as Mustafa Kh\u0101n, Shamsh\u012br Kh\u0101n, Umar Kh\u0101n, Atau-l-lah Kh\u0101n, Haidar Ali Kh\u0101n, Faquiru-l-lah Beg Kh\u0101n, Mir Jafar, Mir Sharfu-d-din, Shaikh Muhammad Ma\u2019sum\nwho had previously received arrow-shots at the hands of the Bhaliah, suddenly lost heart, and sending all their baggages to Sik\u0101kul remained unencumbered. When Mirza Baqir came to know of the disloyalty and cowardice of his soldiers, ostensibly he gave out that he contemplated advancing against the enemy, but in reality he planned to withdraw to the Dakhin. Whilst completing his arrangements for withdrawal to the Dakhin, he detached a force to Qaprah\\(^1\\) ghat, which is the ferry of the river Mah\u0101ndi and is situate midway the town of Katak. And he himself with \u015eaulat Jang, &c., and a number of other captives together with tents, &c., crossed the river Katjuri. Mah\u0101bat Jang was encamped on the banks of the river Kamhariah,\\(^2\\) at a distance of forty Karoh from Katak, and there at midnight messengers bought him news of Mirza Baqir's flight. Immediately summoning Mir Mu\u1e25ammad Ja'far the generalissimo, Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Kh\u0101n, Shamsh\u012br Kh\u0101n, Sard\u0101r Kh\u0101n, 'Umar Kh\u0101n, Buland Kh\u0101n, Sir\u0101nd\u0101z Kh\u0101n, Balisar Kh\u0101n and other Afgh\u0101n generals, and holding a Council of War, Ali Vardi that very night with their concurrence despatched them expeditiously under the command of Mir Ja'far Kh\u0101n to pursue Mirza Baqir Kh\u0101n. Soon after, Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n himself with the remainder of his army set out. When the aforesaid generals with their army arrived five karoh from Katak, Mirza Baqir Kh\u0101n being apprised placed \u015eaulat Jang in a fringed Rath, placed in it \u1e24\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad Amin, brother of Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n, with a drawn dagger, to be his companion and attendant, and also set two armed horsemen on two sides of the Rath, with\n\nAmanat Kh\u0101n, Mir Kasim Kh\u0101n, Bahadur Ali Kh\u0101n. Ali Vardi reached with his army the northern banks of the Mahanadi river opposite to Katak town, whilst Mirza Baqir Ali was encamped with his troops on the southern banks of the same river. Seeing Ali Vardi's huge army, Mirza Baqir Ali's soldiers fled, and dispersed in all directions, whilst Ali Vardi's troops plunged into the river, quickly crossed over to Katak town (at the Jobra Ghat, as would appear from the Riyaz), and rescued \u015eaulat Jang who was encaged in a Rath (a four-wheeled carriage) covered over with a white sheet tied round it with white strings. \u015eaulat Jang's escape from certain death was almost miraculous.\n\n\\(^1\\) \"Qaprah\" of the text is known locally as 'Jobrah' ghat. It is situate midway the town of Katak, alongside the Mahanadi river. Close to the ghat, there is an old mausoleum.\n\n\\(^2\\) \"Kamhariah\" river of the text is probably a misprint or misreading for \"Dhumra\" river, down Jejpur, which would be about 40 Kroh from Katak.\ninstructions that should the army of Mah\u0101bat Jang overtake them, they should instantly hack up \u0160aulat Jang with daggers and spears and on no account should let the latter escape. And Mirza Baqir himself mounted a horse, and along with the Rath containing \u0160aulat Jang he left the La'l B\u0101gh Palace situated in the city of Katsak, and arrived at Malis\u0101r. At this time, Balisar Kh\u0101n with fifteen horsemen, who were his comrades, came up. The flags carried by the cavalry were visible in the forest. By chance, at that time, from the excessive heat of summer, \u0160aulat Jang changing his seat inside the Rath sat in the place where H\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad Amin had hitherto sat, and gave his own seat to the H\u0101ji. At the very sight of the flags of Balisar Kh\u0101n's cavalry, the two armed horsemen who rode alongside the Rath thrust their spears through the Rath\u2014screen, wounded H\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad Amin whom they mistook for \u0160aulat Jang, and fled. As fate would have it, as soon as the spear-thrust pierced the H\u0101ji's hand and shoulder, the H\u0101ji's dagger fell from his hand, and shouting out, \"you have killed me; you have killed me,\" the H\u0101ji tumbled down inside the Rath. \u0160aulat Jang, the cup of whose life was not yet full to the brim, remained unscathed. When the Afgh\u0101n troops were busy looting the vanquished, Mir Mu\u1e25ammad Ja'far Kh\u0101n Bah\u0101dur and Mu\u1e25ammad Amin Kh\u0101n Bah\u0101dur, with a few men fell in with the runaways, and moved in every direction in quest of Sa'id Ahmad Kh\u0101n Bah\u0101dur \u0160aulat Jang; but \u0160aulat Jang fearing lest some enemy might be searching for him,\n\n1 Lal Bagh, on the banks of the Katjuri, now forms the residence of the Commissioner of the Orissa Division. It was built by Musalman Governors of Orissa for their residence, in preference to Fort Barabati on the banks of the Mahanadi.\n\n2 Malis\u0101r is apparently a mistake for Mukamasar, a place across the Katjuri, about 2 miles distant from the Lal Bagh, on the Puri road.\n\n3 As the sequence of the story would indicate, the H\u0101ji was to some extent shamming death, and was a sly fox, for quickly after he got up, and nimbly scampered off, mounting another man's horse.\n\n4 Mir Mu\u1e25ammad Amin was a step-brother of Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n, surnamed Mah\u0101bat Jang, and brother-in-law of Mir Ja\u015bar, the latter having married an uterine sister of Mir Mu\u1e25ammad Amin. Neither Ali Vardi nor his father was a Syed; they were Mirzas; and therefore, Mu\u1e25ammad Amin (Ali Vardi's step-brother) could not have been a Syed or Mir from his father's side, he was so probably from his mother's side. It is common amongst Mu\u1e25ammadans (and the usage has the sanction of authority) to call themselves Syeds, if their mothers are Syedas.\nheld his breath quietly. When Muhammad Amin Khan came up quite close, Saulat Jang, recognising his voice, answered him. The aforesaid Khan, on hearing the response, immediately tearing the screen of the Rath, and cutting up the tent-ropes brought out Saulat Jang, and dismounting from his horse embraced him. And Mir Muhammad Ja'far Khan also coming up, they embraced each other, and after offering thanks to Providence for the safety of Saulat Jang's life, they indulged in jubilations. At the time when they were busy with embraces and hand-shakings, Haji Muhammad Amin, finding an opportunity, nimbly got out of the Rath, and mounting the horse of Muhammad Amin Khan fled to the jungle, and vanished. When after enquiries into the condition of Saulat Jang they mounted their own horses, Muhammad Amin Khan was confounded at the disappearance of his own horse. On subsequently ascertaining the secret, they were all sorry.1 When the Afghan soldiery, after finishing their work of plunder and sack, rallied round Mir Muhammad Ja'far Khan, they sent Saulat Jang to Mahabat Jang, whilst they themselves set out in pursuit of Mirza Muhammad Baqir. Finding the chance of his escape to be slender, the Mirza became desperate, and opened the battle by shooting rockets and arrows and firing muskets. When the fighting was about to turn to a charge with spears and swords, Murad Khan, the generalissimo of the Rajah of Puri,2 who with a large contingent of troops supported Mirza Baqir, seizing the rein of the Mirza's horse, and by use of great persuasion, pulled him back from the battle-field. Becoming his guide, Murad Khan led the Mirza by a route across the forest towards the Dakhin. Ali Vardi Khan, after holding a thanksgiving service for meeting Saulat Jang and obtaining victory, allowed Saulat Jang to retire to the city of Katak for rest, whilst he himself, after resting some time and being freed from all anxiety on account of the enemy, entered Katak triumphantly. And after chastising fully the adherents and friends of Mirza Baqir, Ali Vardi confiscated all the branded3 horses of Mirza\n\n1 If Mir Ja'far and his friends were capable of appreciating a practical joke, instead of being sorry, they might have enjoyed a hearty laugh.\n\n2 This was Hafiz Qadir, Rajah of Ratipur, Khurdah, and master or Superintendent of the Jagannath Temple.

Therefore, on arrival at the port of Balasore, he girded up his loins in order to chastise the R\u0101jah. The latter was at Harihar-pur which contained his mansion, and was at the time plunged in pleasures and amusements. His knowledge of the denseness of the forests that surrounded him, coupled with his command of numerous hordes of Chawars and Khandaitis, made him feel insolent, and so he did not pull out the cotton of heedlessness from the ear of sense, nor cared for the army of Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n. Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n\u2019s army stretching the hand of slaughter and rapine, set about looting and sacking the populations, swept the R\u0101jah\u2019s dominion with the broom of spoliation, captured the women and children of the Khandatis and Chawars, and sowed dissensions amongst them. The R\u0101jah, seeing the superiority of Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n\u2019s army, with his effects, followers and dependants, fled to the top of a hill, and hid himself in a secret fastness, beyond the ken of discovery. Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n then subjugated the tract of Morbhanj, shewed no quarter, and mercilessly carried fire and sword through its limits.\n\nMir Habib, the Generalissimo of Murshid Quli Kh\u0101n, after the commanders for military purposes after being branded.

At this time, Raghoji Bhoslah, nephew of the R\u0101jah of the Dakhin, was Governor of the \u0160ubah of Berar. Taking advantage of the circumstance that Mah\u0101bat Jang was occupied with the affairs of Orissa, and finding that the whole extent of Bengal was denuded of troops, Raghoji Bhoslah detached his generalissimo, Diwan Bh\u0101skar Pandit, and Ali Qaraw\u0101l, who was an able general, with a contingent of sixty thousand Mahratta cavalry from N\u0101gpur, in the company of Mir Habib, by the route across the forest, in order to invade and pil- lage Bengal. On receiving news of the approach of Mahratta freebooters, Mah\u0101bat Jang abandoned the pursuit of the Morbhanj R\u0101jah, and withdrew towards Bengal.\n\nAs yet Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n had not passed through the forests of Morbhanj, when the army of Mahratta freebooters swooped down from the direction of the chakl\u0101h of Bardw\u0101n.\u00b9 Mah\u0101bat Jang, with the celerity of lightning and wind, marching swiftly by night and day, reached the inn of Ujalan adjoining to Bardw\u0101n. The armies of Mahratta freebooters, concentrating from different directions, commenced looting baggages and tents. The Bengal army, which was ignorant of the tactics of Mahratta free-booters, but which had heard tales about their barbarity and rava-ges, stood motionless from fear like an army of statues, and were hemmed in and attacked by the freebooters. Their baggages were looted, and their food-supplies were cut off. Horses, elephants, and camels of the Bengal army were captured, and carried off by the freebooters. The army of Mah\u0101bat Jang, being tired out by the devastating onslaughts and sieges of the freebooters, broke in disorder. The Mahrattas at once hemming in attacked the\n\nMahratta freebooters, in order to place the Moslem Satrapy in Bengal under Mahratta heels. The story is an object-lesson, and illustrates the intellectual and moral desolation that had seized Musalmans in Bengal at the time.\n\n\u00b9 It is related in the Se\u012bru-l-Muta\u1e25eer\u012bn (Pers. text, p. 507), whose author's father, Syed Hedait Ali Kh\u0101n, was at the time employed as Fanjdar of Magha in Behar, and was on an expedition to the hill-passes of Ramgarh, that the Mahratta cavalry numbering 40,000 led by Bhaskar Pandit, general of Raghoji Bhoslah, swooped down through the above passes, cut through Paghit and Morbhanj, and appeared near the outskirts of Mednip\u016br. Raghoji Bhoslah (miscalled in the Pers. printed text of the Riyas, Raghoji Ghoslah) was a nephew of Rajah Saho and Makasar (probably Governor or Chief) of the \u0160ubah of Berar, and his capital was at Nagpur in the Central Provinces.\nelephant Land\u0101h on which Mah\u0101bat Jang\u2019s Begam was mounted, and capturing the elephant dragged it towards their own camp. Mu\u1e63\u0101\u1e25ib Kh\u0101n Mohmand, a son of U\u2019mar Kh\u0101n the General, having his Hindust\u0101ni courage aroused in him, attacked the freebooters, and advancing his feet of valour and gallantry, by means of valorous onslaughts and Rustam-like onsets, rescued the elephant together with its fair rider from the clutches of the freebooters. In consequence, however, of numerous mortal and ghastly wounds that they received, Mu\u1e63\u0101\u1e25ib Kh\u0101n and a large number of his comrades and kinsmen drew the red paint of martyrdom on the face, and on that very spot of slaughter were buried. And when the freebooters from impudence and insolence made onslaughts from all sides, Mah\u0101bat Jang, of necessity, opened leathern bags of coins, and scattered them on the field.\n\n1 It is interesting to note that we saw Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n\u2019s Begam moving beside her husband on an elephant at the battle of Balasore, and we find her again by the side of her husband at this battle with the Mahrattas, near Bardw\u0101n. She must have been a lady not only of nerve, but of wisdom, to have been retained by his side as a companion by Ali Vardi at such critical junctures. We saw also that that iron-man Ali Vardi in his usurpation of the Bengal Nizamat, bended himself before Na\u1e63\u1e63\u0101h Kh\u0101nam and sued for pardon from her. From such incidents, the inference is not without warrant that Musalman ladies in Bengal even towards the middle of the eighteenth century occupied a different position from what they occupy now, took an active part in the wider concerns of their husbands, and exercised a powerful and beneficent influence both in the domains of politics and Society.\n\n2 His name would indicate he was an Afghan belonging to the Mohmand tribe.\n\n3 The Seiru-l-Mutakkerin (Pers. text, pp. 507-518) gives a very graphic description of this first Mahratta invasion of Bengal (1155 A.H.), and of the causes which rendered it possible. The first cause was the instigation of Asif Jah (of Mir Habib, according to the Riyas which seems more probable; for Asif Jah was too high-minded to set loose Mahratta freebooters on a Musalman satrapy); the second cause was the discontent of Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n\u2019s Afghan troops and officers, notably of Mu\u1e63\u1e6dafa Kh\u0101n, as Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n had disbanded many Afghan levies after the Kat\u0101k expedition to rescue \u0160aulat Jang; the third cause was the treacherous assassination by Ali Vardi of the Rijah of Morbhanj, whose cause was espoused by Mu\u1e63\u1e6dafa Kh\u0101n. The Seir further states that when Bhaskar Pandit reached near Bardw\u0101n via Pachit with 25,000 cavalry (given out as 40,000 cavalry), Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n was on his way back from Orissa at Midnapur, with only 4 or 5,000 cavalry and 4 or 5,000 infantry, the latter having ordered back all his other troops to Murshid\u0101b\u0101d with \u0160aulat Jang. Ali Vardi reached Bardw\u0101n with this small army. Bhas.\nThus diverting the freebooters with the work of picking up coins, Mah\u0101bat Jang seized this respite, and with the celerity of lightning and wind riding out at full gallop arrived at Bardw\u0101n. The hungry troops, who for three days and nights had not seen the face of food-stuffs, quenched the fire of their hunger with the stores of Bardw\u0101n. The army of Mahratta freebooters followed up in pursuit. Sacking villages and towns of the surrounding tracts, and engaging in slaughters and captures, they set fire to granaries, and spared no vestige of fertility. And when the stores and granaries of Bardw\u0101n were exhausted, and the supply of imported grains was also completely cut off, to avert death by starvation, human beings ate plantain-roots, whilst animals were fed on the leaves of trees. Even these gradually ceased to be available. For breakfasts and suppers, nothing except the discs of the sun and the moon feasted their eyes. And for nights and days together, being constantly mounted on their high saddles, they did not even dream of sleep. The Afgh\u0101n and Bh\u0101liah troops becoming desperate, determined to die hard. Mah\u0101bat Jang, seeing signs of defeat, owing to the exhausted condition of his soldiery, held a Council of War. It was at last decided to place the artillery round the army, and to put baggages in the centre, and in this form to march out expeditiously from Bardw\u0101n to Katw\u0101h, where food and fodder would be either procurable, or could be imported by waterways or highways from the environs of Murshid\u0101b\u0101d, to relieve the distressed soldiery. In short, in pursuance of\n\nkar Pandit having heard of Ali Vardi's bravery, proposed to the latter to give him ten laks of rupees by way of his entertainment expense, in which case he would return to his own country. Ali Vardi received this suggestion with disdain. For some time he was hard-pressed by the Mahrattas, especially owing to the defection of his Afgh\u0101n officers and troops. Ali Vardi then with Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah waited on his Afgh\u0101n General-in-Chief, Mu\u1e63\u1e6dafa Kh\u0101n, told him to kill him with his grand-son, or else to give him his support, in order to oppose this Mahratta invasion. Mu\u1e63\u1e6dafa Kh\u0101n, together with other Afgh\u0101n officers now fought bravely against heavy odds with the Mahrattas, and Ali Vardi succeeded in retiring to Katw\u0101h, where provisions with a reinforcement came up under \u0160anlat Jang from Murshid\u0101b\u0101d. At Katw\u0101h, Mu\u1e63\u1e6dafa Kh\u0101n inflicted a severe defeat on Bhaskar Pandit, who now seriously thought of returning to his own country via Birbhum; but his chief adviser, Mir Habib, dissuaded him and brought him back from Birbhum to Katw\u0101h, holding out prospects of loot, and making himself responsible for the Mahratta conquest of Bengal.\nthis plan, setting out at night from Bardwan, Mah\u0101bat Jang's army marched towards Katw\u0101h, and in a short interval by forced marches reached Katw\u0101h. The light Mahratta cavalry, however, covered forty karoh a day, and thus before Mah\u0101bat Jang's arrival at Katw\u0101h, they had already burnt down its fields, farms, and granaries, and reduced them to ashes. The army of Mah\u0101bat Jang now being in a state of utter despair, sent up to the skies wails, similar to the following:\u2014\n\nWe never get relief from distress;\nTo whatever country we roam,\nWe see the sky alone.\n\nHowever, H\u0101ji Ahmad collecting the bakers of Murshid\u0101b\u0101d got breads prepared, and sent these together with other eatables and food-stuffs on boats to Katw\u0101h. Other provisions and food-grains were also similarly conveyed gradually and in large quantities. At last, Mah\u0101bat Jang's army were saved from starvation, and their cattle also received a grateful supply of fodder and grass. Mah\u0101bat Jang's soldiers, whose houses were in Murshid\u0101b\u0101d, felt homesick, and gradually drifted away towards their homes.\n\nAs Mir Sharif, brother of Mir Habib, together with the family treasures, dependants and children, was at Murshid\u0101bad, Mir Habib with seven hundred Mahratta cavalry swooped down on Murshid\u0101b\u0101d, in order to relieve his brother. Marching expeditiously, night and day, early at day-break, Mir Habib reached Dihp\u0101rah and Ganj Muhammad Kh\u0101n,\u00b9 to which he set fire. And opposite to the Citadel, crossing the river Bh\u0101girati, Mir Habib reached his residence, and taking out Mir Sharif, together with his treasures, effects, followers, and dependants, he kept them in his company. Sweeping clean the houses of numerous residents of the City with the broom of plunder, and looting as much gold and silver coins as he could from the houses of Jagat Set, and capturing Mur\u0101d Ali Kh\u0101n,\u00b2 a son-in-law of Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n, and R\u0101jah Dulabh R\u0101m\u00b3 and Mir Shuj\u0101u-d-din, Superintendent of the\n\n\u00b9 These would seem to have been suburbs of Murshid\u0101b\u0101d.\n\u00b2 He was a son of Na\u1e63\u012bbah Begam, sister of Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n, and subsequently became the latter's son-in-law, and in Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n's time held the office of Deputy Governor of Jahangirnagar. See n. ante.\n\u00b3 Dulabh R\u0101m was a son of R\u0101jah Janokiram P\u0113ghkar, and was appointed by\nB\u0101jutara\u1e25 Sair duties, he encamped at Tiratkonah, which was to the west of the City, at a distance of one farsakh. H\u0101ji Ahmad, Naw\u0101ziq\u0101n Ahmad Kh\u0101n and Husain Quli Kh\u0101n, who were in the City, at the very sight of the Mahratta cavalry, firing their guns once or twice, and closing the avenues to the City as well as the gates of the Citadel, entrenched themselves, but found it impossible to fight and disperse the enemy, or to defend the City. On the next day, Mah\u0101bat Jang, with his army marching night and day, entered Murshid\u0101b\u0101d. Then the Mahrattas abandoned the idea of assaulting the City, and after desolating the surrounding tracts across the river returned to Katw\u0101h. The rainy season now set in. In view of the tumultuousness of the river, the Mahrattas now suspended their fighting, established their quarters at Katw\u0101h, and from there commenced making administrative arrangements. Giving Mir Habib a free hand in all affairs, Bhaskar Pandit himself remained at Katw\u0101h, and sent out detachments in all directions for raid and plunder. Similarly, Mah\u0101bat Jang, in view of giving rest to his army, did not move out of the City.\n\nAs in his earlier years, Mir Habib had lived at Hugli, the latter place still abounded with many of his kinsmen and friends. Their headman, Mir Abu-l-Hasan Sarkhil, now laid plans to surprise Hugli. He won over many of the Mughals to his side, and held secret correspondence with Mir Habib. Mir Mu\u1e25ammad Riz\u0101, the Deputy Fanjd\u0101r of Hugli, used to treat Mir Abu-l-Hasan as his right-hand in all affairs.\n\nMah\u0101bat Jang \u0160ubadar of Orissa, in place of Abdul Rasul Kh\u0101n who was recalled. Dul\u0101b R\u0101m had been before Peshkar in Orissa. Dul\u0101b R\u0101m exhibited great cowardice when the Mahrattas invaded Orissa. The Mahrattas captured him, and he was released on payment of a heavy ransom after a year. He was very superstitious, and spent his time mostly in the company of San-yasis, who turned out to be Mahratta spies. See Seiru-l-Mutakker\u012bn, p. 545 (Pers. text).\n\n1 In the Seiru-l-Mutakker\u012bn (Pers. text, p. 514) it is stated that Mu\u1e25ammad Yar Kh\u0101n, a step-brother of Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n, was at the time Governor of the Port of Hugli, and that Mir Abu-l-Hassan and Mir Abu-l-Qasim, who were intimate with the above Governor, conspired with Mir Habib, and induced the Governor by their treacherous assurances to admit Mir Habib into the Fort of Hugli. After thus treacherously seizing Hugli, Mir Habib installed as its Governor Sis R\u0101o, a Mahratta, whilst he himself played the role of the Chief Administrator of Mahratta affairs in Bengal, and divided his residence between Hugli and Katw\u0101h.\nIn blissful ignorance of the fact that he had a traitor in his camp, the Deputy Faujd\u0101r passed nights and days in carousals. At length, at the instigation of Mir Ab\u016b-l-\u1e24asan, Mir \u1e24abib with a detachment of two thousand cavalry commanded by S\u012bs R\u0101o advanced to Hugli, and at midnight arriving at the gate of its Fort announced his arrival to Mir Ab\u016b-l-\u1e24asan. Whilst Mu\u1e25ammad Riz\u0101, arranging a feast of revelry, was quite absorbed in watching the dancing of some pretty women, Mir Ab\u016b-l-\u1e24asan said to the former: \u201cMir \u1e24abib has come alone to visit you, and is waiting at the gate of the fort.\u201d Under the influence of liquor, the Deputy Faujd\u0101r unhesitatingly ordered the gate of the Fort to be thrown open and to admit Mir \u1e24abib. Entering the Fort, Mir \u1e24abib with the concurrence of Mir Ab\u016b-l-\u1e24asan placed Mu\u1e25ammad Riz\u0101 and Mirz\u0101 Piran under surveillance, established himself inside the Fort, and posted his own guards at its gate. The noblemen and residents of the town that very night fled to Chuchrah (Chinsurah) and other places, and took refuge in the houses of the Dutch and French. Next morning, S\u012bs R\u0101o with his detachment of cavalry entered the Fort. Many of the Mughal residents who were Mir \u1e24abib\u2019s acquaintances were introduced to S\u012bs R\u0101o by Mir \u1e24abib. The R\u0101o treated them courteously and deferentially, reassured every one of them, and issuing proclamations of peace and security forbade the Mahrattas from looting or sacking the town. He persuaded the Zamind\u0101rs to assess and collect the revenue, and appointing as usual Q\u0101z\u012bs, Mu\u1e25tasibs and other officers to administer justice, he bestowed the office of Faujd\u0101r on Mir Ab\u016b-l-\u1e24asan. Mir \u1e24abib, carrying off some guns and ammunitions together with a flotilla of sloops from Hugli, rejoined Bh\u0101skar Pandit at Katw\u0101h.\n\nAs it was the rainy season, Mir \u1e24abib deputed Mir Mi\u1e25d\u012b with a detachment of musketeers on boats for collecting revenue from the mahals across the Ganges. But Mir Mi\u1e25d\u012b, from fear of Mah\u0101bat Jang, did not land. The agents of the Zamind\u0101rs proceeded to Mir \u1e24abib, and paying him large sums obtained guards for the immunity of their tracts from the ravages and loot of Mahratta freebooters. The wealthy nobility and gentry, to save their family honour, quitted their homes, and migrated across the Ganges.\u00b9 The whole tract from Akbarnagar (Rajmahal)\n\n\u00b9 That is to say, there was a general exodus of the Musalman nobility and gentry from the western side of the Ganges (that is, from Southern and West...\nto Mednipur and Jaliser (Jalasore) came into the possession of the Mahrattas. Those murderous freebooters drowned in the rivers a large number of the people, after cutting off their ears, noses and hands. Tying sacks of dirt to the mouths of others, they mangled and burnt them with indescribable tortures. Thus they desolated and dishonoured the family and children of a whole world. Mahabat Jang, making strenuous efforts towards the chastisement and expulsion of the insolent enemy, set about collecting troops and armaments. Requisitioning Murshidabad a large flotilla of boats from the neighbourhood of Jahangirnagar (Dacca), from the Jilengi, from Maidah, and Akbarnagar (Rajmahal), &c., he constructed a road leading to Katwah. From the eastern bank of the Bhagirati he detached for bridge-making twelve thousand pioneers and sappers on boats, and attended to the comforts of the army. Collecting paraphernalia, horses, elephants, and swords, and winning the hearts of his soldiery by bestowing on them gifts and increments in pay, he encouraged and incited them to fight. Finding the enemy absorbed in political affairs relating to Zamindars, Revenue-Collectors and Administrators, Mahabat Jang seized this opportunity.\n\nern Bengal) to its Eastern and Northern sides (that is, Eastern and Northern Bengal) which were immune from Mahratta raids. Those who are at pains to account for the comparatively large Musalman population in Eastern and Northern Bengal and are ready to put forward more or less fanciful theories, might perhaps take into consideration the above circumstance, and also the following facts which I summarise from the Seiru-l-Mutakherin (a contemporary account). The Seir states that in this wave of Mahratta invasion of Bengal, the whole of the Chaklahe of Bardwan, Medinipur, Balasore, Katik, Birbhum, some pargannahs of Rajshahi (probably those on the south side of the river) Akbarnagar (Rajmahal) were overwhelmed, whilst only Murshidabad and the countries on the other side (that is, Eastern and Northern sides) of the Ganges remained peacefully in possession of Ali Vardi Khan, that in the rainy season, even the populations of Murshidabad, apprehending Mahratta raids, migrated en masse on boats to the other sides (that is, Eastern and Northern sides) of the Ganges, such as Jahangirnagar or Dacca, Maidah, Rampore Beauliah, &c., and that even Nawab Shahamat Jang (Ali Vardi's son-in-law) with his family and children moved across the river to Godagari, a place close to Rampore Beauliah, on the north bank of the Ganges or Poda. These historical facts occurring as they did only in the middle of the eighteenth century, would sufficiently explain why the Musalman populations in Western Bengal and even near Murshidabad (the latest Musalman capital in Bengal) are numerically much less than those in Eastern or Northern Bengal (See Seiru-l-Mutakherin, Pers. text, pp. 564 and 514).\nportunity, and held a Council of War with his Afghan and Bhaliah Generals in view of delivering a night-attack. In pursuance of this plan, Mah\u0101bat Jang marched expeditiously with a large and efficient army, and by forced marches, at midnight, reached a place just opposite to Katw\u0101h. In the cover of the night's darkness, he instantly floated a bridge of boats that had been kept ready from before, and with a large army commenced crossing the river. Whilst he with the officers and some veteran soldiers had crossed the river, the bridge suddenly gave way under the heavy weight of a large army. Some of the boats sank, whilst a large number of Afgh\u0101ns and Bhali\u0101hs were drowned in the river. Mah\u0101bat Jang, on learning about this mishap, was engulfed in a sea of confusion. His mind was racked with anxiety. He realised that the entire army from the eastern bank of the river had been unable to cross over, and that he alone with a handful of troops was on the western bank face to face with the enemy. In consequence, he apprehended that in the event of the enemy getting scent of his movement, he would meet with a terrible disaster. He, therefore, put out the torches, and gave directions for immediately repairing the broken portions of the bridge. After the bridge was repaired, he ordered the whole army to cross over and join him. As the enemy was heedless and negligent, everything ended well. Kishwar Kh\u0101n, the Deputy Faujd\u0101r, and M\u0101nkant, the commandant of the pioneers and sappers, quickly rendered the damaged boats water-tight by plastering their cracks and rends with mud and bits of wood, and thus displayed Luqm\u0101n-like skill. An army, waving like the sea, swiftly crossed the bridge, rallied round Mah\u0101bat Jang and his Generals, and quickly unsheathing their swords, in a solid and clamorous phalanx, like some heavenly disaster, swooped down on the enemy. Shouts rose up on every side.\n\nTrue, the night was dark, but the sword flashed,\nSo as amidst the dusky clouds, lightning flashes.\nFrom profuse shedding of blood on that battle-field,\nEarth's face turned crimson.\nHeaps of corpses crashed on heaps of corpses,\nAye, formed veritable mounds on every side.\n\nOverwhelmed with disaster, and unable to stand their ground, Mir \u1e24abib and Bh\u0101skar Pandit with other Mahratta officers fled\nfrom the battle-field, leaving their army to their fate, just as a cow is left to the tender mercies of a butcher. A crushing defeat was inflicted on the Mahratta army, which was triumphantly chased to some distance. Bhaskar and other Mahratta Generals fell back to R\u0101mgadh, from where with common consent they marched with celerity across jungles, to invade and ravage the \u0160ubah of Orissa.\n\nShaikh Muhammad Ma's\u016bm, the Deputy Nazim of Orissa, in order to resist the enemy, advanced from Katak, and opposed the enemy\u2019s march. When the two armies encountered each other, the fire of conflict flared up once again. Although the Zamind\u0101rs had deserted his side, with a small band numbering five thousand cavalry and infantry, Shaikh Muhammad Ma's\u016bm stood his ground dauntlessly on the field. The Mahratta army, which was more numerous than ants and locusts, surrounded Shaikh Ma's\u016bm from all sides like a circle, and slaughtered him together with his comrades. The \u0160ubah of Odishah (Orissa), together with the Fort of Barab\u0101ti and the citadel of the City of Katak, fell once again into the hands of the enemy.\n\nNaw\u0101b Mah\u0101bat Jang, on hearing of the above disaster, marched swiftly to Bardw\u0101n. He paid to each soldier two months\u2019 pay and also other gifts on account of the victory of Katw\u0101h, advanced to Katak, and repeatedly assaulting the Mahratta troops drove them from Katak, and victoriously entered its citadel. Leaving General Abdu-r-Ras\u016bl Kh\u0101n, who was a second Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Kh\u0101n, and\n\n---\n\n1 This defeat of the Mahrattas at Katw\u0101h took place in 1156 A.H. The Seir states that after his defeat at Katw\u0101h, Bh\u0101skar Pandit, the Mahratta General, fled through the hill-passes of Pachit into a forest, but losing his way, and not succeeding in making his retreat to his own country (Nagpur), under the guidance of Mir Habib, came back to the jungles of Bishanpur, passed through them to the jungles of Chandrakonah, emerged at Midnapur, and made for Katak, fought with and killed Shaikh Ma's\u016bm, \u0160ub\u0101dar of Orissa. Mah\u0101bat Jang hotly chased Bh\u0101skar Pandit up to the confines of the Chilka Lake, but Bh\u0101skar succeeded in effecting his retreat into the Dakhin. Then Mah\u0101bat Jang returned to Katak, where he installed Abdul Nabi Kh\u0101n (nephew of Shaikh Ma's\u016bm) as \u0160ub\u0101dar of Orissa, and left Dulab Ram (son of Raj\u0101h Janaki Ram) as Peshkar under the latter, and then returned to Murshidabad (p. 519, Seiru-l-Mut\u0101her\u012bn, Pers. text).\n\nThere is a village called Mas\u016bmpur about 11 miles north from Katak. It is a colony of respectable Mu\u1e25ammadans, and is probably named so after the above Shaikh Ma's\u016bm Panipati. Six miles from Mas\u016bmpur, is another colony of respectable Musalmans at Salihpur.\nwho was also the latter's nephew, as the Deputy Nazim of Orissa, together with a contingent of six thousand cavalry and infantry, Mah\u0101bat Jang returned to the \u0160\u016bbah of Bengal.\n\nOn receiving news of the defeat of Bh\u0101skar Pandit, S\u012bs R\u0101o evacuating the fort of Hugli retreated to Bishanp\u016br. Other Mahratta officers, who were posted at different places for the collection of revenue, also fled. The Collectors and Faujd\u0101rs of Mah\u0101bat Jang entered the ravaged tracts, and again set about to re-settle them.\n\nBut Bh\u0101skar Pandit, after his defeat, sent Bairagi dacoits towards Akbarnagar (Rajmahal), Bh\u0101galp\u016br, and Beh\u0101r. Mah\u0101bat Jang, who had not yet breathed freely, again set out from Bengal for those places. He had not yet reached the \u0160\u016bbah of Beh\u0101r, when the Bairagis retreating from those parts swooped down on Murshid\u0101b\u0101d. Mah\u0101bat Jang fell back from Beh\u0101r, and pursued them. These Bairagi freebooters were busy with looting Bal\u016bchar, when the music of the drum and tambourine of Mah\u0101bat Jang's vanguard rang in the ears of those maniacs. Losing all courage, and leaving behind bags of booty, they fled from Bal\u016bchar. Mah\u0101bat Jang chased them up to R\u0101mgadh, from where he returned.\n\nIn short, this sort of guerilla warfare lasted three years. Victories on both sides were mingled with defeats, and it was hard to decide which side eventually came off the best. Naw\u0101b Mah\u0101bat Jang, following the saying that \"war is made up of fraud,\" diplomatically established friendly relations with Ali Qaraw\u0101l, who was one of the Mahratta leaders that had embraced the Mu\u1e25ammadan faith, and was surnamed Ali Bh\u0101i. From considerations of expediency, Mah\u0101bat Jang invited him over. Receiving him kindly and courteously, using dissimulation and artfulness, and professing friendship and benignity, he made him consent to arrange an interview between himself and Bh\u0101skar Pandit with other Mahratta Generals. Heedless of the duplicity of the times, that simpleton was taken in, and arrived at Diknagar. He induced Bh\u0101skar and other Mahratta Generals to meet Mah\u0101bat Jang, by conveying to them the assurances and avowals of Mah\u0101bat Jang with reference to the settlement of the Chauth and the establishment of friendly relations. And these, in accordance with the saying;\u2014\n\n\"One perceiveth according to the length of his sight,\" placing\n\n---\n\n1 The Arabic saying is:\n\n\u0625\u0630\u0627 \u062c\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0628\u0631 \u0628\u0637\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0635\u0631\nthe finger of acceptance on their blind eyes, summoned to their presence R\u0101jah J\u0101naki R\u0101m and Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Kh\u0101n for fixing the basis of a treaty, and for ratifying it by protestations and oaths. These going over to Bh\u0101skar made vows and oaths, according to the forms of their respective religions and creeds. Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Kh\u0101n had with him, under a cover, a brick instead of the Qor\u0101n, and holding it he repeated oaths. Falling into the trap laid by Mah\u0101bat Jang, and reiterating the vows of peace, Ali Bh\u0101i and Bh\u0101skar with other Mahratta Generals promised to meet Mah\u0101bat Jang at a place called Mankarah,\u00b9 and permitted Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Kh\u0101n and R\u0101jah J\u0101naki R\u0101m to return. These going to Mah\u0101bat Jang assured him of the success of their mission, and related the mutual promises and vows that had taken place. Expressing his satisfaction, Mah\u0101bat Jang ostensibly set about collecting valuable khillats and jewelleries, together with elephants, horses, and other rare and precious presents for presentation to the aforesaid Mahratta Generals. Announcing to the general public news of the approaching peace, Mah\u0101bat Jang covertly laid a plot of treachery, and took into confidence his own Generals towards its development. He picked out veteran and brave soldiers from his army, and caused long and wide tents, capable of holding large detachments with horses and elephants, to be pitched at Mankarah. Himself going into one of the tents, he arranged a grand party of friends and comrades. He secreted in battle-array inside the tents a battalion of picked men, and sent a message to Ali Bh\u0101i to bring over Bh\u0101skar with all the Mahratta Generals. In short, Bh\u0101skar, leaving all his troops in camp, came to Ali Vardi\u2019s tent, together with Ali Bh\u0101i and twenty-one other Mahratta Generals. The tent-pitchers following the signal dropped down the screens of the pavilion, tied them strongly with tent-ropes, and cut off the ingress and egress of friends and foes. Mah\u0101bat Jang, at the very sight of Bh\u0101skar, said to his comrades who were waiting for the signal: \u201cKill these heathen sinners.\u201d\u00b2 Instantly, swords sprang up from every side on the Mahrattas.\n\n\u00b9 In Seir (p. 529) Mankara is described as lying on the banks of the Bhagirathi. How the wily Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n treacherously inveigled Bh\u0101skar Pandit and other Mahratta Generals into his tent, is lucidly described in the Seiru-l-Mutakkerin (p. 529). In this game of treachery, Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n\u2019s principal coadjutors were Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Kh\u0101n and R\u0101jah Janaki Ram, the Peshkar. It must however, be added that the Mahrattas were well paid back in their own coin.\n\n\u00b2 The expression given in the Seir (p. 530) is: \u201cKill this enemy.\u201d\nThe clamour of assault rose up to the skies,\nBreasts were pierced through by swords.\n\nBh\u0101skar and twenty-one other Mahratta Generals were butchered. In the midst of this carnage, Mah\u0101bat Jang mounting an elephant ordered the music of victory to be struck up, and ordered his select battalion to charge the Mahratta army with their swords. On seeing this, one of the Mahratta Generals, who was posted outside the pavilion with ten thousand cavalry, fled together with his force. Mah\u0101bat Jang's soldiers pouncing like fighting lions on this flock of sheep fiercely attacked the Mahratta troops, and slaughtered them, right and left, raising human shambles, and captured those who escaped the sword. On hearing of this disaster, other Mahratta detachments which were encamped at Bardw\u0101n and Diknagar, or patrolled the tracts between Mednip\u016br and Akbarnagar (R\u0101jmahal) fled to N\u0101gp\u016br.\n\nWhen news of this disaster reached the ear of Raghoj\u012b Bhoslah,\n\nHe knitted his brow, from fury of rage,\nAnd coiled, like a serpent, from anxiety of lost treasures.\nHe kindled such a fire of wrath in his heart,\nThat he scorched himself from head to foot.\n\nAfter the rainy season was over, Raghoj\u012b Bhoslah mobilised a large force, and marched towards Bengal, to avenge the\n\n1 His name was Ragho Gaekwar. (See Seir, p. 531). Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Kh\u0101n tried hard to inveigle him also into Ali Vardi's tent, but this Mahratta General appears to have been an uncommonly shrewd man, and said he would wait on Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n on the following day, after Bhaskar Pandit and Ali Bhai had returned from their interview with Ali Vardi.\n\n2 In the printed Pers. text 'Diknagar,' which place I cannot locate.\n\n3 The Seiru-l-Mutakherin (Pers. text, pp. 545-548) gives a very lucid account of this second Mahratta invasion of Bengal by Raghoj\u012b Bhoslah. It appears that important affairs transpired in the meantime in the Bengal Satrapy, which made for this second Mahratta invasion. In the first place, Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Kh\u0101n, the Afghan General-in-Chief and the chief pillar of the State of Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n, fell out with the latter, and was locked up in fighting against Ali Vardi's son-in-law, Zain-d-din Kh\u0101n, Sub\u0101dar of Azimabad (Patna). Whilst hardpressed by the well-formed battalions of Zain-d-din Kh\u0101n, Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Kh\u0101n, like Mir Habib, took the unusual step to invite over to Bengal Raghoj\u012b Bhoslah, who seized the invitation with avidity and marched with Mir Habib (the implacable foe of Ali Vardi and the inspiring genius of the Mahrattas), towards Katak. At this time at Katak, a cowardly person ruled as Ali\nslaughter of Bh\u0101skar and other Mahratta Generals, and engaging on massacres, captures, and plunders, tortured many of his cap-\n\nVardi's Subadar in Orissa. His name was Dulab Ram, and he was a son of Rajah Janoki Ram, Ali Vardi's Peshkar. Ali Vardi had appointed Dulab Ram as Subadar, in the place of Abdul Rasul Khan (son of Abdul Nabi Khan) who had resigned his office and joined Mustafa at Patna. Dulab Ram was not only cowardly, but superstitious, and most probably, also treacherous (as his subsequent conduct towards Ali Vardi's grandson indicates). He associated at Katak with the Sanyasis, most of whom were spies in the employ of Raghoji Bhosla. As soon as Dulab Ram heard of the approach of the Mahrattas, he attempted to run away; but was soon after captured by the Mahrattas. At this time, a small band of Syeds, under the command of Mir Abdul Aziz, bravely held out for over a month in the Fort of Barabati. The heroic stand against heavy odds made by this small beleaguered garrison and its unflinching loyalty, once more relieves the darkness of the moral chaos that had seized the times. When cajoled and threatened by Raghoji Bhosla's friend, Mir Habib, and entreated by Dulab Ram and by his own brother to join Raghoji's side, Mir Abdul Aziz returned the following gallant and loyal answer: \"I own no brother nor any other master; I acknowledge only one master, namely, Mahabat Jang; true, some cowards have joined you; but from regard for the salt I have eaten, I will, by God, stand by this Fort, so long as there is breath in my life.\" (Seir, p. 546). As however, no reinforcements came up, though over a month had elapsed, and as all provisions had run out; this noble band of beleaguered garrison had at length to capitulate on honourable terms to Raghoji Bhosla, who made himself master of the Fort Barabati and also of the whole of Orissa province, as well as of Medhipur, Hugli and Bardwan. Ali Vardi was occupied at this time in Patna in crushing out the Afghan revolt under Mustafa Khan. When Mustafa Khan was slain and the Afghan revolt was crushed, Ali Vardi hastened back to Bengal. At this time, Raghoji was encamped at Birbhum. Meanwhile the Afghan comrades of the late Mustafa Khan, who lay in a death-trap in the Jungles of Tikari asked Raghoji to help them, and promised him their adhesion. Raghoji marched to Tikari to their rescue via the jungles of Birbhum and Kharakpur, looting en route the villages of Shaikpura and Tikari, &c. Mahabat Jang followed quickly in their heels and moved to Patna. From Patna, Raghoji (on the advice of Mir Habib, who was the inspiring genius of the Mahrattas, also in this second Marhatta invasion) turned towards Murshidabad, pursued closely by Ali Vardi, whose pursuit was hot and unsacking. At Katwa, another battle was fought, in which the Mahrattas were worsted. Finding that victory was out of the question, and hearing of some troubles in his own country, Raghoji now prudently withdrew to his own country at Nagpur, leaving in Bengal his friend, guide, and philosopher, Mir Habib, with 3,000 Mahratta and 7,000 Afghan troops. (See Seiru-l-Mutakherin, Pers. text, p. 551). It would seem a despicable moral chaos had at this time seized the country, in which neither religious ties\ntives. Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n with a large army again advanced to encounter the enemy. At this juncture, Bal\u0101ji R\u0101o, son of B\u0101j\u012b R\u0101o Pandit, Peshw\u0101 and generalissimo of R\u0101jah S\u0101h\u016b, who was young, and had enmity with Raghoji, under orders of Emperor Muhammad Sh\u0101h, came from the Imperial Capital (Dihli) to Bengal with sixty thousand Mahratta cavalry, to re-inforce Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n. Mah\u0101bat Jang, finding floods of disaster approaching Bengal from two sides, shewed firmness and foresight. He deputed experienced envoys with presents to Bal\u0101ji R\u0101o, won him over to his side by display of courtesy and sincerity, met him at Birbhum, established friendly relations with him, and both unitedly resolved to drive out Raghoji Bhoslah. Raghoji finding it impracticable to accomplish the object of his mission withdrew to his own country, without gaining his end. Being somewhat relieved of his anxiety by the withdrawal of Raghoji Bhoslah, Mah\u0101bat Jang presented a large amount of cash to Bal\u0101ji R\u0101o, and thus sent him out of Bengal in a contented and thankful mood, whilst he himself returned to Bengal. Being inwardly in anxiety as to the demand of Raghoji for Chauth, Mah\u0101bat Jang set about mobilising troops.\n\nAt this moment, a rupture occurred between Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n and nor national sentiments were held of any account. One finds now Musalman Afghans (at the instigation of two Musalman leaders, Mir H\u0101bib and Mu\u1e6d\u1e6da\u1e6da Kh\u0101n), fighting the battles of Hindu Mahratta freebooters against a Musalman power in Bengal. The event is a dark land-mark in Moslem history of Bengal, and marks the sad disintegration and moral paralysis that had now seized the Musalman race in Bengal or, for the matter of that, in India. (See Seir, Pers. text, pp. 566-568).\n\n1 Balaji Rao (the generalissimo of the Imperial Army in the Dakhin) and \u1e62afdar Jang, son-in-law of Burhanu-l-Mulk, the \u1e62ub\u0101dar of Oudh, were ordered by Emperor Muhammad Sh\u0101h, to help Ali Vardi against the Mahrattas under Raghoji. Whilst seeking Imperial assistance, Ali Vardi wrote the following pregnant and prophetic words to the Emperor:\u2014\"Should Bengal which is the financial mainstay of the Empire fall, your Majesty's Empire will be shorn of all lustre.\" (See Seir, p. 516, Pers. text). These words had reference to the fact that Bengal had ever been the best milch-cow of the Empire. \u1e62afdar Jang did not pull on with Ali Vardi, and so was recalled by the Emperor, whilst Balaji Rao (whose designs were also suspected by the shrewd Ali Vardi) who had come to Mankar by way of Patua, was courteously shewn out of Bengal by the latter. (See Seir, pp. 522 and 524). In this connection, the Seir (p. 524) gives the story of a Musalman amazon in the person of the widow of the late Muhammad Ghans Kh\u0101n who resided at Bhagalpur, and who held out bravely against Balaji Rao.\nMu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Kh\u0101n, the Afgh\u0101n General, and it was so far accentuated that all the Afgh\u0101ns combining with the latter, broke out into revolt, and set out with a large force for Azim\u0101b\u0101d (Patna), in order to storm that City, and to capture H\u0101ji Ahmad and Zainu-d-din Ahmad Kh\u0101n. On reaching Mungir (Monghyr), Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Kh\u0101n besieged the Fort of Monghyr. The Commandant of the Fort prepared to fight. Abdu-r-ras\u016bl Khan,\u00b9 a cousin of Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Kh\u0101n, advancing in the inebriation of the wine of valour and daring, wanted to storm the Fort, by battering down its gate. The guards of the Fort hurled down a huge stone on his head. From the blow of that heavy stone, his head was smashed to atoms. Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Khan, viewing this disaster to be a bad omen, abandoned the siege of Monghyr, marched with celerity to Azim\u0101b\u0101d, (Patna), engaged in besieging the latter City, and commenced fighting with Zainu-d-din Ahmad Kh\u0101n. Most of the detachments of Zainu-d-din Kh\u0101n, not being able to stand their ground in the face of the onslaughts of the Afgh\u0101ns, retreated to the citadel, but Zainu-d-din Kh\u0101n himself with a small squadron of cavalry, artillery, and Bhali\u0101h musketeers remained out in the open to encounter the enemy. At this moment, the Afgh\u0101ns fell to plundering and pillaging the tents of Zainu-d-din\u2019s troops who had retreated. Seeing Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Kh\u0101n now left with a small force, Zainu-d-din Ahmad Kh\u0101n formed a van-guard of artillerymen and Bhali\u0101h musketeers, and commenced an assault.\u00b2 The shells of guns and bullets of muskets now commenced showering like hail. Most of Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Kh\u0101n\u2019s comrades tasted the bitter potion of death; whilst one bullet, hitting Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Kh\u0101n on the socket, blinded one of his eyes. Then Zainu-d-din\u2019s other troops who had retreated to the citadel also rushed out, attacked the Afgh\u0101ns, and put them to the sword. Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Kh\u0101n on being defeated retreated to Jagdishp\u016br.\u00b3 Becoming victorious and triumphant, Zainu-d-din Kh\u0101n struck up the band of victory, made his State entry into the Fort, and next engaged on chasing the enemy. Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Kh\u0101n now sent a message to Raghoji Bhoslah,\u2074 and asked for help.\n\n\u00b9 He was \u1e62ub\u0101dar of Orissa before Dulab Ram. See note ante.\n\u00b2 The whole thing would seem to have been a well-planned tactical move on the part of Zainu-d-din Kh\u0101n, who was a good General, strong in tactics.\n\u00b3 The printed Persian text of the Riyaz has throughout \u201cRaghoji Ghosl\u0101h.\u201d\n\u2074 Ghosl\u0101h\u2019 is obviously a misreading or misprint for \u2018Bhoslah.\u2019\n\u2075 \u2018Jagdishp\u016br\u2019 or \u2018Jagdispur\u2019, is mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbari (Vol I\nRaghoji, who was waiting for such an opportunity, was delighted, and prepared to despatch reinforcements. But Mah\u0101bat Jang, on being apprised of this news, swiftly marched to Azim\u0101b\u0101d (Patna). The Bengal and Azim\u0101b\u0101d (Patna) armies forming a junction combined to attack Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Kh\u0101n. After much fighting, Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Kh\u0101n, finding it impossible to hold his own, retreated in a hapless condition across the frontier of Azim\u0101b\u0101d to Gh\u0101zip\u016br; whilst Mah\u0101bat Jang becoming victorious and triumphant returned to Murshid\u0101b\u0101d. Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Kh\u0101n again collected a large force of cavalry and infantry, and again invaded Azim\u0101b\u0101d. Zainu-d-din Ahmad Kh\u0101n, according to the adage \u201cOne who is beaten once can be beaten twice,\u201d with his victorious troops encountered him, and after much efforts and countless exertions, and after much slaughters and fightings, became victorious, whilst Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Kh\u0101n, as a retribution for his disloyalty, was slain on the battle-field. Zainu-d-din Kh\u0101n cutting off the head of that wretch from his body tied his corpse to the feet of an elephant which was patrolled round the city to serve as a warning, and also suspended his head at the City Gate.\n\nAt this juncture, Raghoji Bhoslah despatched to Bengal a Mahratta army under the command of his son Rajah J\u0101noji, his adopted son, Mohan Singh, and the miscreant Mir Habib, in order to demand the Chauth.\u00b9 A large number of Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Kh\u0101n\u2019s Afghan ad-\n\n\u00b9 This third Mahratta invasion of Bengal under Janoji, son of Raghoji Bhoslah (with him being of course the inevitable Mir Habib as the Chief Adviser and as guide, friend and philosopher of the Mahrattas), is also lucidly narrated in the Seiru-l-Mutakher\u012bn (Pers. text, pp. 555-692). Janoji came to Katak, whilst Ali Vardi\u2019s newly-nominated Deputy Subadar of Orissa, Mir Jafar, was still at Mednipur, on his way to Katak. On hearing of the Mahratta incursion, Mir Jafar (who secretly was conspiring against Ali Vardi) retired to Bardwan. The Mahrattas then advanced to Bardwan. After some indecisive skirmishing, Janoji made for Murshid\u0101b\u0101d, and after doing some looting in its neighbourhood retreated to Mednipur, pursued by Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n. In the meantime, Janoji\u2019s principal adviser, Mir Habib, had opened treacherous negotiations with the late Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Kh\u0101n\u2019s Afghan adherents.\nherents also joined them, and the market of fight and slaughter once again became warm in the conflict between Mah\u0101bat Jang and the Marhattas. The \u0160ubah of Orissa fell into the hands of Janoji, whilst weakness set in in the Province of Bengal. Mir Habib opened negotiations for the settlement of the Chauth of Bengal. Naw\u0101zish Ahmad Kh\u0101n, Ahsan Quli Kh\u0101n, Jagat Set, and the Rai-Rai\u0101n exerted themselves strenuously on the side of peace. But in Darbhanga and its neighbourhood, and these had effected a sanguinary revolution by treacherously killing at a Darbar Zainu-d-din Kh\u0101n, \u0160ub\u0101d\u0101r of Patna. Now Janoji moved to Patna (with him being Mir Habib), and Ali Vardi also proceeded to Patna. Ali Vardi now rose to the height of his generalship, and succeeded in crushing and routing his united Afghan and Marhatta foes in a great battle near Barh. (See the spirited description of this battle in the Seir, p. 566). Janoji, now receiving news of his mother's death, retreated to Nagpur, leaving Mir Habib towards Katak and Mednipur with some Mahratta and Afghan troops (Seir, p. 576). Shortly after, Raghoji sent to Mir Habib another Mahratta reinforcement under Manaji, younger brother of Janoji [Mohan Singh of the text is obviously a mistake or misprint for Manaji]. Ali Vardi marched out with his army from Murshidabad and passed through Katwah, Bardwan, Mednipur, Bhadrak, and Jajpur; whilst Mir Habib with his Mahratta and Afghan troops fell back from Mednipur towards Katak. Ali Vardi triumphantly entered once more the City of Katak, and recaptured the Fort of Barabati, after killing its commandants, Serandaz Kh\u0101n, Syed Nur, and Dharam Dass (p. 578, Seir), Pers. text. This re-conquest, however, proved abortive, for whilst Ali Vardi was still at Balasore on his way towards Murshidabad, Mir Habib with his light Mahratta and Afghan cavalry swooped down on Katak, and killed Shaikh Abdus Subhan, who had been left there as Deputy Governor by Ali Vardi. (See pp. 579-580 of the Seir, which also gives a good description of the Katak City). The Mahrattas, it would seem, always moved with light and mobile cavalry, whilst Ali Vardi's army was not equally light or mobile. Ali Vardi had, therefore (despite the fact that next to Assafjah, he was the first General of the time in India) to encounter the same difficulties in encountering Mahratta troops, that the British had in encountering the Boers in the late South African War. In the end, it is true, Ali Vardi triumphed, but the price that he had to pay for his apparent victory was too much, nor did he survive it long enough to reap its benefit.\n\n1 In a former part of the text, he is named \"Husain Quli Kh\u0101n,\" which appears to be correct. (See Seir, Vol. II, Pers. text, p. 495). Husain Quli Kh\u0101n was Naib or Deputy of Nawazish Muhammad Khan, son-in-law of Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n, and Governor of Chakla Jahangirnagar (Dacca), including Silhat and Chittagong.\n\n2 Nawazish Muhammad Kh\u0101n was Governor of Jahangirnagar, and also held the portfolio of Supreme Diwan of Bengal under Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n, the Deputy Diwanship being held by Qhin Rai (who had been Peshkar under Alam-\nMah\u0101bat Jang, considering the acceptance of Chauth to be humiliating, refused to conclude peace, and with his army prepared to fight and drive out the Mahrattas. Mah\u0101bat Jang suspected treachery from Sham Sher Kh\u0101n, Sard\u0101r Kh\u0101n, Mur\u0101d Sher Kh\u0101n, \u1e24ai\u0101t Kh\u0101n, and other Afghan Generals of D\u0101rbh\u0101\u1e45ga, who, during the late insurrection, had sided with Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Kh\u0101n. And, as a matter of fact, these Afghan Generals had opened at this time reasonable correspondence with Mir Habib and his Mahrattas. These Afghan Generals, following the example of Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Kh\u0101n, now broke out into open revolt on the pretext of demand of pay. Mah\u0101bat Jang, having lost all confidence in them, paid them up, and disbanded them. These reaching Darbh\u0101\u1e45ga, after a short time, leagued amongst themselves in pursuance of designs of treachery, and made offers of service to Zainu-d-din Ahmad Kh\u0101n. As Zainu-d-din Kh\u0101n was a friend of soldiers, he conciliated them, accepted their offers of service with the approval of Naw\u0101b Mah\u0101bat Jang, and invited them to a Darbar. Sham Sher Kh\u0101n and Mur\u0101d Sher Kh\u0101n with a corps of Afghans arrived at \u1e24ajipur, and encamped on the banks of the river. According to the order of Zainu-d-din Ahmad Kh\u0101n, they left behind all their soldiers, and crossing the river came to A\u1e45im\u0101b\u0101d (Patna) attended only by three hundred cavalry, consisting of kinsmen and comrades who were all of one heart for the purpose of waiting on Zainu-d-din Ahmad Kh\u0101n. On obtaining an audience, they observed all the points of etiquette, and sat in the Gh\u012bhil sat\u016bn Palace, ranged on the right and left of Zainu-d-din. Zainu-d-din Ahmad Kh\u0101n reclining against pillows on a Masnad, made polite enquiries regarding each. Mur\u0101d Sher Kh\u0101n, nephew of Sham Sher Kh\u0101n, finding Zainu-d-din off his guard, pulled out a dagger from his waist, hit the latter so hard with it on the stomach, that his intestines came out. By that single blow, Zainu-d-din was killed.\u00b9 The traitors, lifting\n\n\u00b9 It would appear from the account given in the Seiru-l-Mutakkerin (p. 566), alluded to before, that the Afghan adherents of the late Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Kh\u0101n were in secret conspiracy with Mir Habib, the inspiring genius, and the guide, friend and philosopher of the Mahrattas, and that in consequence of Mir Habib\u2019s instigation, they had enacted this cruel tragedy at Patna.\n\nA very laudable account of this tragedy is given in the Seiru-l-Mutakkerin.\nup their swords, cut down Zainu-d-din's companions, looted all his treasures and effects, captured the Begam\\(^1\\) with her daughter and also H\u00e1ji Ahmad. They suspended the H\u00e1ji\\(^2\\) to a tripod with his head downwards, and by torturing him made him give up large treasures, and slew him. They carried off the ladies of the Harem together with numerous treasures as booty. And similarly, they swept the houses of other nobles of the City with the broom of rapine. These Rohilah Afghans sacked the City and its suburbs, looted treasures, dishonoured women and children, and desolated a whole world.\\(^3\\) A great consternation seized those regions. \"Protect me, O Lord, from the wickedness of infidels and from the wrath of Thine.\" Sham Sher Kh\u00e1n collecting one hundred thousand cavalry and infantry was not contented with the subjugation of Azim\u00e1b\u00e1d, and he further cherished visions of conquering Bengal. Mah\u00e1b\u00e1t Jang, who was at this time encamped at Am\u00e1-niganj\\(^4\\) on some important business connected with the Mahratta\n\n(Pers. text, p. 569). Zainu-d-din (son-in-law of Ali Vardi Kh\u00e1n and Sub\u00e1d\u00e1r at Patna), was holding a Darbar for the reception of the Darbh\u00e1nga Afghan Generals who were adherents and connexions of the late Must\u00e1fa Kh\u00e1n. The Darbar function was nearly over, and Zainu-d-din Kh\u00e1n was handing betels with his own hand to the Chief Afghan Generals, when one of these, Abdur Rashid Kh\u00e1n, whilst receiving a betel, treacherously gave Zainu-d-din Kh\u00e1n a dagger-thrust in the abdomen. This thrust, however, was not quite effective, as Abdur Rashid's hand faltered. Then another cowardly assassin, Murad Sher Kh\u00e1n, quickly gave another sword-cut to Zainu-d-din Kh\u00e1n, and instantly killed him. The Afghans shewed ferocious barbarities in their conduct towards the ladies and children of Zainu-d-din's household. The Seir (p. 561), notes commencement of Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Abdali's invasions of India at this time.\n\n\\(^1\\) Her name was Amena Begam. She was a daughter of Ali Vardi, and wife of Zainu-d-din Kh\u00e1n.\n\n\\(^2\\) The H\u00e1ji after all met with his desert, for his black ingratitude to his benefactor's (Shujan-d-din Kh\u00e1n's) memory, and for his dark treachery towards his benefactor's son, Nawab Sarfaraz Kh\u00e1n.\n\n\\(^3\\) See description of this loot and carnage in the Seir (pp. 560-561).\n\nHappening as it did towards the middle of the 18th century, this fact would explain in a great measure the smallness of Musalman population in Behar, compared with that in Northern Bengal and Eastern Bengal, which in modern times were never or seldom the scenes of such carnage, which were immune from Mahratta raids, and which would, therefore, naturally afford an asylum for Musalman refugees not only from the disturbed parts of Western and Southern Bengal, but also from Behar.\n\n\\(^4\\) The Seir (Pers. text, p. 563) states that at this time, which was towards the month of winter, Ali Vardi Kh\u00e1n was encamped at Amanigunj, in order\nfreebooters, suddenly received the terrible intelligence of the slaughter of Zainu-d-din Ahmad Khan and Haji Ahmad, and of the hostile advance of the Afghans. In consequence, an indescribable agony seized him, and his family and kindred. From excessive depression and agony, he wanted to isolate himself from all intercourse with the world, and to abandon the City with its Baz\u0101r to the Mahratta freebooters. His generals employing various consolations and assurances recited passages inculcating fortitude, and tied the girdle of courage in pursuit of revenge in the waist of their hearts. But when for accomplishing this avenging mission, they applied for the payment of the soldiers, Mah\u0101bat Jang pleaded he had no money. Then Naw\u0101zish Muhammad Khan Shah\u0101mat Jang, standing surety for the expenses of the soldiery, paid to the soldiers eighty laks of rupees in cash from his own treasury, and made them agree to undertake the avenging expedition. Mah\u0101bat Jang, being somewhat now relieved from anxiety, left Naw\u0101zish Muhammad Khan Shah\u0101mat Jang at Murshid\u0101b\u0101d, and himself marched to Azim\u0101b\u0101d with a large army.\u00b9 Mir Habib, at the instigation of Sham Sher Khan, with hordes of Mahratta freebooters, pursued Mah\u0101bat Jang from the rear, tracking jungles and setting fire, right and left, to the villages, with their granaries. Mir Habib looted Mah\u0101bat Jang\u2019s baggages and tents, and did not allow Mah\u0101bat Jang\u2019s army a breathing interval either for sleep or for food, nor suffered a single day to pass without skir-\n\n\u00b9 The account in the Seir (p. 565), shews that Mir Habib with his Mahratta friends opposed ineffectually Ali Vardi\u2019s march on the banks of the Champanagar stream, and then dispersed to the jungles, whilst Ali Vardi moved on to the Monghyr Fort, where he halted some days. Then B\u0101jah Sundar Singh, Zam\u012bnd\u0101r of Tikari, and Kamgar Khan Mu\u012bn, Zam\u012bnd\u0101r of T\u012brht, came to pay homage to Ali Vardi. A saint, Maulana Mir Muhammad Ali, also visited Ali Vardi at this time at Monghyr.\nmishes with swords and spears, till they passed beyond B\u0101rh. At Baikanpur\u00b9 an engagement took place with the army of Sham Sher Kh\u0101n. R\u0101jah Sundar Singh, Zamind\u0101r of Tikari, with a powerful corps, joined Ali Vardi. And when on both sides, the fire of slaughter flared up, the army of Mahratta freebooters, who, like the shadow, always followed Mah\u0101bat Jang's army, attacked its rear. Afghan troops from front and Mahratta freebooters from the rear attacked and hemmed in the army of Mah\u0101bat Jang. The heroes of Mah\u0101bat Jang's army, perceiving the approaching inrush of calamity towards them from both sides, prepared to die hard, and fought desperately. In that victory lies with God, by a stroke of good luck, Sham Sher Kh\u0101n, Sard\u0101r Kh\u0101n, Mur\u0101d Sher Kh\u0101n, and other Afghan Generals were hit by bullets of guns, in retribution for their disloyalty, and were killed, whilst other Afghan troops cowardly fled. The soldiers of Mah\u0101bat Jang, by brave onslaughts, routed the enemy's army, charging them with swords, spears, arrows, muskets and rockets, killed those wretches, and raised hecatombs of the slain. The Mahratta army, on seeing Ali Vardi's glorious victory, retreated, and dispersed like the constellation of the bear. Mah\u0101bat Jang after prostrating himself in thanksgiving to God, triumphantly entered Azim\u0101b\u0101d, and rescuing the family and children of Zainu-d-din Ahmad Kh\u0101n and H\u0101ji Ahmad from the rack of those outragers of honour, captured the wives and daughters of those treacherous wretches.\n\nTime itself with the sword in hand is always after retribution; what need is there for anyone to seek for retaliation?\n\nNawab Mah\u0101bat Jang, shewing considerateness, paid travel-\n\n\u00b9 The Seir (p. 567), which gives a very lucid account of this battle, states that Ali Vardi who in generalship was next only to Asaf Jah, took up a position on an isle, in front of Barh, having on one side the river Ganges and on another the old bed of the same river. This place is called in the Seir \"Sarai Rani,\" 4 kroh to the west of Barh, on the side of the river Ganges.\n\nIt would also appear from the Seir (p. 568), that Mir Habib and the Mahrattas held a conference with the Afghan rebels, Sham Sher Kh\u0101n and Sardar Kh\u0101n, in order to concert measures for attacking Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n. The Afghans and Mahrattas under Mir Habib now made a common cause against Ali Vardi who, however, crushingly defeated both, owing to his superior generalship (See Seir p. 568).\n\n\u00b2 It reflects credit on Ali Vardi that he treated honourably the women and children of Sham Sher Kh\u0101n and other Afghans. He not only generously\nling expenses to the Afghan ladies, and allowed them to depart honourably to D\u0101r bh\u0101ng\u0101, and followed the adage \"Turn Evil by Good.\" Appointing Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah, son of Zainu-d-din Ahmad Kh\u0101n, to be \u0160\u016bbad\u0101r of Azim\u0101b\u0101d, in succession to his father, and leaving R\u0101jah Janaki R\u0101m as Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah's Deputy there, and finishing the administrative arrangements of that \u0160\u016bbah, Mah\u0101bat Jang returned to Bengal, in order to drive out the Mahratta freebooters.\n\nAbout this time, the office of Faujd\u0101r of the tract of Purni\u0101h was vacant, owing to the flight to the Imperial Capital of the Kh\u0101n Bah\u0101dur,1 son of Naw\u0101b Saif Kh\u0101n. Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n conferred the above Faujd\u0101rship on Said Ahmad Kh\u0101n \u0160aulat Jang, in whose heart ambition for the Niz\u0101mat of Bengal lurked, and in whose head visions of ruling over Bengal existed. At the time when Mah\u0101bat Jang was engaged in fighting with Sham Sher Kh\u0101n, Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah shewed his temper to Naw\u0101b Izazu-d-daulah \u0100\u1e6d\u0101u-l-lah Kh\u0101n S\u0101bit Jang, a son-in-law of H\u0101j\u012b Ahmad, who held the office of Faujd\u0101r of Akbarnagar (Rajmahal). Knowing \u0100\u1e6d\u0101u-l-lah Kh\u0101n2 to be brave and popular with the army, and ambitious and sound-headed, Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah set to work his ruin, and plying Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n with his suspicions gained over the latter, and induced him to send a message to \u0100\u1e6d\u0101u-l-lah to quit the country, or else to prepare for death. The aforesaid Kh\u0101n, after\n\nforgave them, and set them at liberty, but bestowed properties at Darbh\u0101ng\u0101 for their maintenance. (See p. 570, Seir). He never addressed the Afghan ladies except as 'Madama' or 'Bibis,' He studiously maintained the sanctity of their seclusion, and this, too, after the gross provocation he had received at the hands of Sham Sher Kh\u0101n and other Afghans. Ali Vardi's chivalry towards women seems to have been remarkable, and his forbearance after victory is also commendable. A vaulting ambition that faltered not to break all ties of gratitude, nor scrupled to use all weapons of treachery in the realisation of that ambition\u2014casts a dark and sombre hue on his otherwise great and remarkable personality.\n\n1 His name was Fakhru-d-d\u012bn Husain Kh\u0101n. He succeeded his father, Naw\u0101b Saif Kh\u0101n, in the Faujd\u0101rship of Purni\u0101h. Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n got him dismissed, and kept him under surveillance for some time at Murshid\u0101b\u0101d. Through the help of Mir Habib and his Mahrattas, Fakhru-d-d\u012bn managed to make good his escape to Delhi, where he died after a short time. (See Seir, Vol. II, p. 582, Pers. text).\n\n2 He was a son-in-law of H\u0101j\u012b Ahmad, brother of Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n. He was Faujd\u0101r of Rajmahal or Akbarnagar during Ali Vardi's regime.\nfighting some time in self-defence, set out at length for the Imperial Capital, remained in the company of Nawab Vazir-i-mulk Safdar Jang, and then joining Rajah Nul Rai in the Rohilla Afghan war was killed at Farrukhabad.\n\nAs in consequence of the insurrection at Azimabad, the Mahratta freebooters had taken possession of the Subah of Orissa, Mahabat Jang, not halting in Bengal, set out for that Subah. Expelling the Mahratta freebooters from that Subah, Mahabat Jang put to death Syed Nur, Sarandaz Khan, and other officers, who were adherents of the Mahratta freebooters, and who were entrenched in the fort of Barahati, by drawing them out of their entrenched position by use of diplomatic assurances. And capturing the horses and armaments of their comrades, and expelling them all from Katak, Mahabat Jang returned to Bengal.\n\nAs Mir Habib was the root of all the mischiefs and troubles, Mahabat Jang hatched a plan for his destruction. He sent to his name a letter, purporting falsely to be a reply to his message, to the following effect: \"The letter sent by you has been received; what you have written in respect of your plan to extirpate the Mahratta freebooters, has met with my approval. It is a very good idea; you from that side, and I from this side, will be on the alert and wait. By every means possible, try and induce them to come this side, and then what is now in the minds of us both will come to pass.\" Mahabat Jang sent this message through a courier, in-\n\n1 Safdar Jang was appointed Subadar of Oude by Emperor Muhammad Shah, and in the reign of Emperor Ahmad Shah became Chief Vizier of the Empire, on the death of Qamru-d-din Khan. At this time, Ahmad Shah Abdali invaded India several times, and the Rohilla Afghans of Farrukhabad and Moradabad became a power in the land. Safdar Jang appointed as his Deputy in Oude a Kyet, named Rajah Nul Rai. (See Seiru-l-Mutakherin, Vol. II, Pers. text, pp. 874-875).\n\n2 Rajah Nul Rai was a Kyesth. At first he was an obscure servant of Nawab-Vizier Safdar Jang, but subsequently rose to the office of Deputy Subadar of Oude under the latter. He resided at Kanauj, twenty kroh from Farrukhabad, the Rohilla stronghold. Nul Rai ill-treated the Rohillas of Farrukhabad, who combined and attacked Nul Rai who was killed. Atan-I-lah Khan (son-in-law of Haji Ahmad) who fought in this war on the side of Nul Rai, was also killed. The reinforcements sent by Nawab-Vizier Safdar Jang to support his Deputy in Oude, Nul Rai, were also routed by the Rohillas. (See Seiru-l-Mutakherin, Vol. II, p. 876, Pers. text).\n\n3 See the account of the capture of the Fort of Barahati in Seir, Vol. II, p. 578, Pers. text.\nstructing the latter to proceed by such a route, that he might be intercepted by the Mahrattas and the letter might fall into their hands. This ruse proved a complete success, and the Mahrattas suspecting Mir Habib slew him.\n\nTo sum up, for twelve long years the fires of war and slaughter kindled between the Mahrattas and Mah\u0101bat Jang, and the Mahrattas did not retire without levying the Chauth. And owing to H\u0101ji Ahmad and Zainu-d-din Ahmad Kh\u0101n having fallen, the power of Mah\u0101bat Jang was weakened, whilst old age and infirmity told on his physical vigour. Of necessity, in view of expediency, and in compliance with the entreaties of Naw\u0101zish Muhammad Kh\u0101n Shah\u0101mat Jang, Mah\u0101bat Jang at last concluded a peace with the Mahratta freebooters, agreeing to pay the latter Chauth for the three \u0160ubahs, and through the medium of Maslihu-d-din Muhammad Kh\u0101n, nephew of Mir Habib, and \u0160adru-l-Haq Kh\u0101n, fixed the basis for the terms of peace and the settlement of the Chauth. In lieu of the payment of the Chauth, he assigned the revenue of \u0160ubah of Orissa to the Mahrattas, and appointed \u0160adru-l-Haq to be its Administrator and Governor. After settling this important affair with the Mahrattas, Mah\u0101bat Jang regained peace.\n\n1 Mir Habib, the inspiring genius of the Mahrattas, and their 'guide, friend, and philosopher' for over a decade,\u2014was at last butchered by Janoji, son of Raghoji Bhosla. But after all, however blameless his initial motive might be, it cannot be denied that he met with his desert for his narrow-minded imprudence in fraternising with the Mahratta freebooters, regardless of all religious and national ties. The account as to how Mir Habib was inveigled into a house by Janoji, and there treacherously murdered in 1166 A.H., is detailed in the Seir, Vol. II, p. 593, Pers. text. The Seir (p. 592), also states that after a treaty of peace was concluded between Mah\u0101bat Jang and the Mahrattas, Mir Habib ruled over Orissa as Governor, on behalf of Mah\u0101bat Jang, whilst a Mahratta contingent of troops under a Mahratta officer was stationed at Katak. Mir Habib was succeeded in the office of Governor by Maslihu-d-din Muhammad Kh\u0101n, who, however, enjoyed less prestige, and regarded himself as a servant of the Mahrattas (Seir, p. 592, Vol. II, Pers. text).\n\n2 There is some difference between the account here and the account in the Seir. From Seir's account (p. 592), it would appear Mir Habib was the first person who held the office that is assigned to \u0160adra-l-Haq in the text, after the conclusion of the peace. The details of this treaty of peace in 1166 A.H. are given in the Seir (pp. 590-591). The Seir states that overtures for peace came from the side of the Mahrattas (represented by Mir Habib) who had first been defeated again in 1164 A.H. at Mednipur. As Mah\u0101bat Jang was\nof mind, and took to travelling and hunting. After ruling for sixteen years, he died of dropsy on Saturday, 9th Rajab, 1169 A.H., corresponding to the second year of the accession of Emperor Alamgir II, and was buried in the Khush B\u0101gh. Sir\u0101ju-ddaulah, who was his heir, then mounted the masnad of Niz\u0101mat.\n\nNow 75 years old, and physical ailment and infirmity had seized him, and as the war between him and Mahrattas had been protracted to ten years, and as the chief Afghan pillars of his State had revolted against him, and as the people had suffered indescribable miseries during this long struggle, Mah\u0101bat Jang accepted the overtures of peace, which was concluded through the intervention of Mirza Salih (on behalf of Mir Habib and the Mahrattas) and Mir Ja\u015bar (on behalf of Mah\u0101bat Jang). The terms of peace were: (1). Mir Habib becoming a servant of Mah\u0101bat Jang should on behalf of the latter rule as Deputy Governor over Orissa. (2). The revenue of Orissa should be assigned by Mir Habib for the pay of Raghoji Bhosla's Mahratta army of occupation. (3). That over and above the revenues of Orissa, twelve laks of rupees should be annually paid by Mir Habib to Raghoji Bhosla (presumably from the revenues of other provinces), on condition that Raghoji's troops should not raid the dominions of Mah\u0101bat Jang. (4). The river Sunamukha (or Subarnarikha) near Jaliser (Jalasore), was to form the demarcation-line of the boundaries of Orissa and Bengal; Mednip\u016br at this time being separated from Orissa and annexed to Bengal.\n\nThe author of the Seir (who was a connexion of Mah\u0101bat Jang) praises up the memory of Mah\u0101bat Jang. (See Seir, Vol. II, pp. 609-611). He states that Mah\u0101bat Jang abstained from pleasures, was regular in his prayers, abstemious in habits, and methodic in business. He slept little, and passed most of his time in attending to State affairs, or in the company of scholars and sevants whom he held in high esteem. He had only one wife, to whom he was greatly devoted. He was a splendid general and a far-sighted statesman. When Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Kh\u0101n, his Afghan General, and his relatives, Sh\u0101hmat Jang and \u0160anlat Jang used to press Mah\u0101bat Jang to fight and drive out the English from Calcutta, Mah\u0101bat Jang used to reply: \"Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Kh\u0101n is a military man, and therefore he is always eager for war, that I may be constantly in need of his services. What evil have the English done to me, that I should wish evil to them? The (Mahratta) fire on land is not yet extinguished; and if the fire is extended to the sea, who will quench it?\" (Seir, p. 611, Vol. II, Pers. text). Despite the Seir's panegyric, it seems to me that Ali Vardi must forfeit his claim to be regarded as a far-sighted statesman, in view of the fact that his treacherous and violent conduct towards his past masters and benefactors inaugurated in Bengal an era of violent treachery and serious disintegration, and that his example quickly reacted on others who paid him and his grandson back in the same coin. In this connection, one may read an interesting old little work in Persian, called Ibrat-i-Arab\u0101t B\u0101r\u012b (meaning 'a Moral for people with eyes') each sentence of which contains\nNIZAMAT OF NAWAB SIRAJU-D-DAULAH.\n\nWhen Nawab Ali Vardi Khan Mahabat Jang passed to the regions of eternity, Nawab Siraju-d-daulah, son of Zainuddin Ahmad Khan Haibat Jang, and maternal grandson of Ali Vardi, who from before had been declared heir-apparent by Ali Vardi Khan, and whom Ali Vardi Khan had in his life-time placed on the cushion of the Nizamat, and to whom Ali Vardi with all the grandees of the court had paid homage and offered presents\u2014ascended the masnad of the rulership over Bengal, Behar, and Orissa. Siraju-d-daulah exhibited insolence and arrogance, which are the worst of attributes, and are displeasing to God. At that time, owing to certain reasons, Ghasiti Begam, widow of Nawazish Ahmad Khan Shahamat Jang, who resided at Mutijhil, resolving to oppose Siraju-d-daulah, appointed Mir Nazar Ali, who was her servant and was bound to her by ties of various favours and obligations, to be the commander of her vanguard, and Nawab Bairam Khan to be generalissimo of her army. Then the Begam of Mahabat Jang, and Jagat Set, as an emissary of Siraju-d-daulah, went to Ghasiti Begam and gave her assurances; and so the latter refrained from hostility, whilst Nazar Ali fled, and Bairam Khan taking refuge with one of the generals fell into disgrace. Siraju-d-daulah's army arriving captured Ghasiti Begam, together with all her effects. The Begam saw what she had never seen, and heard what she had never heard. Siraju-d-daulah's army rased to the ground her buildings and her palace, and unearthing her buried treasures carried them to Mansurganj. Owing to Siraju-d-daulah's harshness of temper and indulgence in violent language, fear and terror had settled on the hearts of everyone to such an extent, that no one amongst the generals of the army or the noblemen of the City was free from anxiety. Amongst his officers, whoever went to wait on Siraju-d-daulah despaired of life and honour, and whoever returned without being disgraced and ill-treated offered thanks to God. Siraju-d-daulah treated all the noblemen and generals of Mahabat Jang with ridicule and drollery, and bestowed on each some contemptuous nick-name that ill-suited any of them. And whatever harsh expressions and abusive letters which added give 1170! (the date of Siraju-d-daulah's murder by Mir Jafar and his son Miran). The Ibrat seems to have been written by some adherent of Nawab Sarfaraz Khan.\n\n1 The Seir (Vol. II, p. 621), mentions that Siraju-d-daulah, on accession, ap-\nepithets came to his lips, Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah uttered them unhesitatingly in the face of everyone, and no one had the boldness to breathe freely in his presence. Appointing a Kyeth, named Mohanlal, to be the minister and controller of all affairs, Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah bestowed on him the title of Mah\u0101rajah Mohanlal\u00b9 Bah\u0101dur, gave him a large bodyguard of cavalry and infantry, and ordered all his generals and nobles to pay respect to him. All did so, except Mir Muhammad J\u0101far Kh\u0101n, a brother-in-law of Naw\u0101b Mah\u0101bat Jang, and the generalissimo of the army, who refused to pay respect to Mohanlal, and for some time ceased to pay respect even to Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah. But R\u0101jah Mohanlal, coiling himself round the brain and skin of Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah, forgot himself so far that he fancied nobody else existed, appointed his own kith and kin to posts connected with the Crown-Domains and also to other revenue offices, and dismissed the old officers. For instance, R\u0101jah Mohanlal sent a message to Naw\u0101b Ghul\u0101m Husain Kh\u0101n Bah\u0101dur\u00b2 that if he accepted a pay of Rs. 200 a month, he might stay on, otherwise he should quit the country. The latter, of necessity, on the plea of visiting the Kabah, set out for H\u0101gli.\n\nInasmuch as before Mah\u0101bat Jang\u2019s death, in the beginning of that year, on the 13th of Rab\u012bu-l-Aw\u0101l, Naw\u0101b Naw\u0101zish Ahmad Kh\u0101n Shah\u0101mat Jang,\u00b3 who held the office of Diw\u0101n of Ben-\n\n\u00b9 The Seir, the Ibrat-i-Arbab-i-Ba\u1e63r, and the Riyaz all condemn Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah for appointing this obscure and insolent Hindu, Mohanlal, as his Supreme Minister, and mention the disgust it caused amongst the old nobility, who chafed under this indignity, and were therefore anxious to throw off Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah\u2019s yoke. (See Ibrat-i-Arbab-i-Ba\u1e63r, p. 26; Seiru-i-Mutakkerin p. 621, Vol. II.)\n\n\u00b2 He was author of the splendid Persian History of India entitled Seiru-l-Mutakkerin. He was a partisan of Mir Jafar and the English East India Company. Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah had ordered his banishment from the country.\n\n\u00b3 He held the office of Deputy Governor of Jahangirnagar (Dacca) under Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n, whose son-in-law he was. He also held nominally the office of Diwan of Bengal, though the practical work of Diwan was actually performed by Hindu Deputy Diwans. Shah\u0101mat Jang had also at Jahangirnagar\ngai, had died, Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah arrested R\u0101jah R\u0101jballab, Peshkar of Shah\u0101mat Jang, on the plea that he should render up his accounts. Although R\u0101jballab tried hard to pay up some cash and to compromise the demands, Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah did not consent, and kept him under surveillance. R\u0101jballab sent his family and children to Calcutta, to take shelter with the English. Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah desired to arrest R\u0101jballab's family also, and ordered R\u0101jah R\u0101m, head of his spies, to proceed to Calcutta, arrest R\u0101jballab's family, and bring them over. Mah\u0101bat Jang, whilst on sickbed, had dissuaded Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah, and directed him to postpone the matter, and urged that after recovery he (Mah\u0101bat\n\na Deputy Diwan in the person of R\u0101jballab, in respect of the Ghakla of Jahangirnagar or Dacca, of which he (Shah\u0101mat Jang) was Deputy Governor.\n\n1 The Seir, the Ibrat-i-Arbab-i-Bagr and the Riyas mention that the new Nawab, Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah, inaugurated his regime by (1) the plunder of Ghasiti Begam, (2) the dismissal of Mir Jafar and the appointment of a Hindu, Mohanlal, as the Supreme Minister, &c., (3) imprisonment of R\u0101jballab, (4) the conquest of Calcutta, and (5) conquest of Purniah. When dispassionately viewed, the particular measures noted above (excepting one, namely the appointment of Mohanlal) do not appear to have been unjustified, though they were impolitic. Ghasiti Begam had no right to take away and appropriate the State treasures held in trust by her late husband, Shah\u0101mat Jang, Ali Vardi's Diwan, and Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah who had lawfully succeeded Ali Vardi was, therefore, justified in recovering them from her. Mir Jafar had proved unfaithful and treacherous even in the lifetime of Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n in the struggle with the Mahrattas (See the Seir); and Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah was, therefore, not unjustified in suspecting him and dismissing him from the responsible office of generalissimo of the army. R\u0101jballab's surveillance was a necessary political measure, as this crafty man, the Deputy Diwan or Peghkar of Jahangirnagar or Dacca under the late Shah\u0101mat Jang (Deputy Governor of Dacca) had failed to render his accounts, and as Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah had reasons to believe he (R\u0101jballab) had misappropriated a large part of the Public Funds in his charge. And when R\u0101jballab's son, Kishan Das, fled with the State treasures to Calcutta, the Naw\u0101b was obliged to advance against Calcutta, to recover the State treasures and chastise his rebel subject, Kishan Das, though had Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah been less impulsive and more prudent, it is possible he might have effected his object by opening diplomatic correspondence with the English. But it must be remembered the Naw\u0101b was yet quite a boy, and had no good or reliable advisers about him. As for the conquest of Purniah, it was a necessary political measure in self-defence, as Shank\u0101t Jang, at Mir Jafar's instigation, had publicly avowed his pretensions to the gadi of Bengal. The only unwise measure was the elevation of an obscure Hindu, named Mohanlal, to the highest civil State office. This measure caused great disgust to the old nobility, who chafed under the insolence of this upstart.\nJang) would himself summon them. At this time, Sir\u0101ju-d-\ndaulah ordered R\u0101jah R\u0101m, head of his spies, to proceed to Cal-\ncutta and arrest and bring over R\u0101jballab's family and children,\nand himself in the month of Sh\u0101h\u0101n, on the plea of touring, pro-\nceeded towards Akbarnagar (R\u0101jmahal). Whilst Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah\nreaching D\u016brahp\u016br had encamped on the bank of the river K\u0101l\u0101-\np\u0101ni, he received news that the English Chiefs in Calcutta had\noffered opposition, and prevented the arrest of R\u0101jballab's family\nand children. On the very receipt of this news, the fire of Sir\u0101ju-\nd-daulah's rage kindled, and he summoned the officers of his\narmy, and said: \"I intend proceeding on an expedition against\nCalcutta. It is necessary that none of you should go back to\nMurshid\u0101b\u0101d, but that all should proceed straight from here to\nChunakhali and encamp there.\" Next morning, setting out,\nSir\u0101ju-d-daulah reached Chunakhali, and from there proceeding by\nforced marches invaded Calcutta. In the month of Ramz\u0101n, fight-\ning with the English, Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah became victorious and trium-\nphant, and the English Chief embarking on a boat fled. Sweeping\nthe town of Calcutta with the broom of plunder, and naming it\nAlinagar, Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah left R\u0101jah Manikband with a large\ndetachment as Governor of Calcutta. Posting strong garrisons at\nMakh\u016bah and Bajbajia (Budge-Budge) and other fords for the\ncrossing and passage of English ships, Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah at the end\nof the above month returned to Murshid\u0101b\u0101d.\n\n\u015eanlat Jang; Faujd\u0101r of Purniah, that year, previous to Mah\u0101-\nbat Jang's death, in the month of Jam\u0101di-l-Aw\u0101l, had died, and\n\n1 Both the Seir and the Ibrat-i-Arbab-i-Ba\u1e63r give his name as Mr. Drake.\n2 That Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah plundered Calcutta, is also mentioned in the Ibrat-\ni-Arbab-i-Ba\u1e63r, (p. 29), as well as in the Seir (p. 622, Vol. II); but none of\nthese more or less contemporary Musalman accounts make any mention of\nthe 'Black Hole' incident, generally associated with Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah's con-\nquest of Calcutta.\n\nThe Seir states that Mr. Drake, the English Chief in Calcutta, with a small\nnumber of English officers fled on a ship, whilst other English residents re-\nmained behind in Calcutta, and fought to the last, so long as their powder and\nshot were not exhausted.' Many of the English fell in this fight, whilst a\nnumber of their comrades were captured. In this connection, the Seir also\nmentions the fact that some English ladies who were captured in this fight\nwere well-treated by a Muhammadan nobleman, Mirza Amir Beg, who escorted\nthem honourably to Mr. Drake's ship and received Mr. Drake's and other\nEnglish officers' thanks for his humane and chivalrous conduct. (See Seir,\nVol. II, p. 622, Pers. text).\nhis son, Shankat Jang, who was a cousin of Sirajuddaulah, had succeeded his father. At this time, Sirajuddaulah desiring to displace Shankat Jang demanded the revenue of Purniah. Shankat Jang replied: \"You are lord of three Subahs (Provinces); whilst I am fallen in this corner, and am content with a bit of bread. Now it does not become your high aspiration to set the teeth of your avarice on this bit of bread.\" Sirajuddaulah, on receipt of\n\nThe account in the Seir (Pers. text, Vol. II, pp. 624-639), is quite different, and is more reliable, as its author was attached at the time as a Chief Adviser to Shankat Jang. It would appear from the Seir that Mir Jafar, in pursuance of his conspiracy to effect a Revolution, had written a letter to Shankat Jang requesting the latter to place himself at the head of the revolutionary party in view of the prospect of succeeding to the Nawabi of Bengal. Shankat Jang was a vain fool, and on receipt of Mir Jafar's letter he openly talked in Darbar of his wild ambition to extend his empire to Ghazni and Kandahar, and to conquer Bengal. Sirajuddaulah hearing of the disloyalty that was brewing in the Purniah Court, deputed Rai Ras Behary (a son of Rajah Janoki Ram and brother of Dulab Ram) to Purniah, with a letter to Shankat Jang, calling upon the latter to make over the Jagirs of Gondwarah and Birnagar (which pertained to the Bengal Nizamat) to Rai Ras Behary. When this letter was received, the author of the Seir (who was then Shankat Jang's principal adviser) being consulted advised Shankat Jang to temporise, to treat Rai Ras Behary with outward courtesy, to mobilise troops, and to pass in this wise till the rainy season was over, when it was expected by the author of the Seir (who appears to have been in the confidence of the English) the English would also fight against Sirajuddaulah and that then Shankat Jang's turn would come to join the winning party. However that may be, Shankat did not adopt the above advice, and sent an insolent reply to Sirajuddaulah, adding that he (Shankat Jang) had received sanad of the Subdans of Bengal, Behar, and Orissa, that Sirajuddaulah had forfeited his head by his disloyalty, but that as an act of grace he would be permitted to settle down quietly in some corner of Jahangirnagar or Dacca. Sirajuddaulah answered the above insolent reply by at once advancing with his army to Manihari, together with his Diwan Mohanlal. Ramnarain from Patna was also ordered to join Sirajuddaulah with the Patna army. In this battle which took place between Manihari and Nawabganj, Shankat Jang was killed, through his folly in leaving his entrenched position and marching through marshy swamps. Sirajuddaulah appointed Mohanlal to the office of Faujdar of Purniah, and the latter left his son as Deputy Faujdar there.\n\nI have given the above details from the Seir, in order to show that the war with Shankat Jang was not of Sirajuddaulah's seeking, that it formed a part of the conspiracy hatched by Mir Jafar, in order to bring about a revolution to destroy Sirajuddaulah's authority, and that Sirajuddaulah had no alternative but to fight in self-defence.\nthis reply, which did not satisfy his designs, despatched Diw\u0101n Mohanlal, together with other Generals such as Dost Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n, Shaikh Din Mu\u1e25ammad, Mir Mu\u1e25ammad, and Jafar Kh\u0101n, &c., with a large army, to fight with Shauk\u0101t Jang; and he also wrote to R\u0101mnar\u0101in, the \u0160\u016bbahd\u0101r of Az\u012bm\u0101b\u0101d, to march quickly to Purniah. From the other side, Shauk\u0101t Jang detailed for fighting Shaikh Jah\u0101n Y\u0101r and K\u0101rguz\u0101r Kh\u0101n, the generalissimo, and Mir Mur\u0101d Ali and others, and subsequently he himself set out and assaulting and sacking and burning H\u0101stp\u016brgolah returned to Purniah. On arrival at Manihari, Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah\u2019s army encamped, whilst Shauk\u0101t Jang\u2019s army at a distance of one Karoh at Naw\u0101bganj entrenched itself. On the next day, Shauk\u0101t Jang also arrived and joined his army; and on the same day, R\u0101jah R\u0101mnar\u0101in, the \u0160\u016bbahd\u0101r of Az\u012bm\u0101b\u0101d, with his contingent of troops, joined Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah\u2019s army. On the morning of the following day, R\u0101jah Mohanlal advanced with his force in order to fight, and unfurled his flag carrying the ensignia of the M\u0101hi Order which he held. Shauk\u0101t Jang, on seeing the ensignia of the M\u0101hi Order, fancied that Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah himself had joined his army, and was marching up for fight, and so Shauk\u0101t Jang advanced also with his army. Shaikh Jah\u0101n Y\u0101r dissuaded Shaukat Jang, saying:\u2014\u201cTo-day the moment for fighting is not auspicious, if it pleases God, to-morrow early in the morning we shall fight, and whatever is decreed by Providence shall take place.\u201d Shauk\u0101t Jang, paying no heed to this dissuasion, marched up to the battle-field. Shaikh Jah\u0101n Y\u0101r was also obliged to advance with his corps, and whilst fighting bravely he received a gun-shot. Shaikh Abdu-r Rashid, his brother, and Shaikh Qudratu-l-lah, his son-in-law, together with Shaikh Jhahan Y\u0101r, his nephew, as well as his other kinsmen were slain on the battle-field, and earned present and future glory. At this time of strife, a sword fell on the neck of the horse of Shaikh Jah\u0101n Y\u0101r, and cut asunder its rein, and the horse furiously galloped away with its rider from the field. As he had already received several mortal wounds, by the time of his arrival at Birnagar, he expired. At that crisis, Shauk\u0101t Jang, himself joining in the fight, advanced, discharging arrows, and came in front of Dost Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n. The aforesaid Kh\u0101n said, \u201cCome on my elephant, as you will find security then.\u201d Shauk\u0101t Jang not consenting fixed a sharp arrow in his teeth, and shattered his front-\ntooth. At this time, besides two horsemen, one of whom was \u1e24ab\u012bb B\u0113g, no one else was with Sh\u0101nk\u0101t Jang. \u1e24ab\u012bb B\u0113g dismounting from his horse stood in front of his elephant on the field. As decreed by fate, a bullet from the gun of a servant of Dost Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n hit Sh\u0101nk\u0101t Jang on the forehead, and the bird of his soul flew away, and nestled on the branches of annihilation. And K\u0101rguz\u0101r Kh\u0101n, the generalissimo Shaikh Bah\u0101dur Narnuti, Ab\u016b Tur\u0101b Kh\u0101n, Mur\u0101d Sher Kh\u0101n, nephew of Shaikh Jah\u0101n Y\u0101r, Shaikh Mur\u0101d Ali, disciple of Naw\u0101b Saif Kh\u0101n, Mir Sult\u0101n Khalil, the archer, Loh\u0101 Singh Haz\u0101r\u012b, and Mir Jafaru-l-jo, &c., displayed gallant bravery, and tasted the potion of death on the battle-field. Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah had advanced to Akbarnagar (R\u0101jmahal), when the tidings of victory arrived; and he ordered the music of victory to strike up. He also caused the adherents of Sh\u0101nk\u0101t Jang, such as were captured, to be punished in various forms. R\u0101jah Mohanlal confiscating fifty-one elephants, and horses, and camels, and other treasures of Sh\u0101nk\u0101t Jang, and leaving his own son as Deputy Governor of the Faujd\u0101r\u012b of Purnial, returned.\n\nWhen Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah, after the fall of his cousin, arrived in Murshid\u0101b\u0101d, the chess-board of time presented a new game. Of the English, who had been routed by Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah in Calcutta, and whose treasures worth several laks had been plundered, some escaped and fled to an island. Thence they sent messages to Eng-\n\n1 The Seir (Vol. II, p. 6331, Pers. text), states that after his flight, Mr. Drake, the Chief of the English factory in Calcutta, together with a number of other English officers, proceeded to Madras, in Aroot Province of the Dakhin. Then Clive had just retired after fighting against the French on behalf of Salab\u0101t Jang (son of the late As\u012bf Jah), Nazim of the Dakhin, who had bestowed on him many favours and also the title of \u0160abat Jang. Then Mr. Drake, with other Englishmen, who had fled from Calcutta, held a conference with the Englishmen in Madras factory, and it was decided that Clive, together with the English refugees from Bengal, \u201cshould proceed to Calcutta and by every means that they thought desirable, should try to renew the foundation of the Factory in Calcutta. If by negociations and by payment of money this object could be attained, well and good; if not, force might be resorted to.\u201d Then Clive, together with other Englishmen, embarked on a ship from Madras, and reached at the mouth of the river H\u00fcgli. As the English Chiefs were very wise, brave, well-informed, and experienced, they made overtures of peace to Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah, begged that Mr. Drake\u2019s offence might be pardoned by the Nawab, and offered to pay the Nawab several laks of rupees, in case the latter granted them permission to re-build their Factory as before in Calcutta. Sir\u0101-\nland and other ports, and in a short time obtained reinforcements. After some months, the English chiefs, under the command of \u0160\u0101bit Jang (Clive), with thirty thousand men, arrived on ships of war, obliged the garrisons of the Nawab's outposts to take to their heels, and fought with R\u0101jsh M\u0101nikchand. The R\u0101jsh suffered a heavy defeat. The English advancing to Hugli, raised its fortifications with the cannonade of their artillery, and the Faujd\u0101r of that Fort fled. Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah, on getting news of the English victory, set out for Calcutta from Murshid\u0101b\u0101d, and encamped in the garden of Karhati, in the suburbs of Calcutta. The English made a night-attack. The next day, Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah not having the boldness to advance, and outwardly proclaiming the conclusion of peace, marched back anxiously to Murshid\u0101b\u0101d. After arrival in Murshid\u0101b\u0101d, Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah found that all the Nobles and Generals were disaffected. Foremost amongst them was Mir Muhammad Jafar Kh\u0101n Bah\u0101dar, from whom the office of generalissimo had been transferred to Khw\u0101jah \u1e24\u0101di Ali Kh\u0101n, and who had shut himself up in his house. Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah placing large batteries in front of Mir Jafar's palace was ready to blow him up, and ordered him to quit the City. Mir Jafar tendering excuses and apologies, secretly set about making warlike preparations in self-defence, and tampering with the Bhaliah Generals and Commanders and with Jagat Set.1 Ratifying their conspiracy by mutual oaths and promises, Mir Jafar sent secretly Amir Beg, who was one of his confidential adherents, with letters\n\n1 Besides Mir Jafar who was the soul of this conspiracy, some other prominent persons, like Dulab Ram (son of Janoki Ram) Jagat Set and Ghasiti Begam (widow of Nawasish Muhammad Kh\u0101n, son-in-law of Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n), were active colleagues of Mir Jafar in this conspiracy. Ghasiti Begam helped Mir Jafar with the State treasures that she had secreted. One may understand the resentment of Mir Jafar (who had been disgraced and dismissed from the office of generalissimo) and of Ghasiti Begam (who had been obliged to disgorge a portion of the State treasures that she had hidden); but the diabolical conduct of Dalab Ram, Jagat Set, Ram Narain, Rajabillah and other Hindus\nto Calcutta, asking the English troops to be sent. Amir Beg, by indulging in various assurances, induced the English Chiefs to\n\nseem to be a riddle, in view of the fact that in the distribution of State Patronage, Siraj-ud-daulah had adopted an extremely pro-Hindu policy, and that it was Siraj-ud-daulah's elevation of an obscure Hindu, named Mohanlal, to the highest civil State office that to a great extent alienated from the Nawab the sympathies of his Musalman adherents, who would have perhaps otherwise stood by him in this crisis. (See Ibrat-i-Arab-bi-Baqr, p. 26.)\n\n1 This Amir Beg is mentioned in the Seir as having conducted some English ladies honourably to Mr. Drake's ship, after Siraj-ud-daulah's capture of Calcutta. Amir Beg, in consequence, enjoyed the confidence of the English. See note ante. On Mons. Las's departure, Mir Jafar worked more vigorously in pursuance of his conspiracy, and induced the English to give Mir Jafar their support, and to fight on his side. To instigate the English to join his conspiracy, Mir Jafar sent to Calcutta to Clive his agent, Mirza Amir Beg. Mir Jafar also sent to Clive through the above Mirza a Manifesto, purporting to bear the seals of some noblemen and officers of Bengal, recounting their grievances, real or fancied, against Siraj-ud-daulah, and inviting the English to deliver them from the Nawab. Jaget Set instructed his Calcutta Agent, Amin (known popularly as Omishand), to work in the same direction, whilst Dulab Ram also instructed his agent to influence the English in the same direction. Mir Jafar wrote to Clive that the latter had only to make a move with his English troops, when all the fighting would be done by Mir Jafar and his fellow-conspirators, whilst three scores of rupees would be presented to Clive for this service. Clive yielded to Mir Jafar's importunities and advanced towards Palasi (Plassey). (See Seir-i-Mutakkerin, Vol. II, p. 667.) In regard to these events, Tarikh-i-Mansuri may also be referred to. Professor Bleekman gives some notes from the Tarikh-i-Mansuri in Journal of the Asiatic Society, Part I, No. II, of 1867. These notes mention that \"Chandernagore fell into the hands of Clive and Watson through the treachery of a French officer, named Tavraneean, who harboured a grudge against the French Governor of Chandernagore, named M. Renault (p. 88, J.A.S. referred to above) and that after the fall of Chandernagore, Mons. Las, a French officer, became an attendant at the Court of the Nawab Siraj-ud-daulah, for whom he fitted out a detachment by the name of Telenga. To this the English objected, saying that according to the recent treaty of peace, the friends and enemies of the English were to be regarded as friends and enemies of the Nawab, and the friends and enemies of the Nawab were to be regarded as friends and enemies of the English. After some correspondence, the Nawab sent away from Murshidabad Mons. Las to humour Clive. At this time (1757), Clive built the present Fort William and a Mint in Calcutta, without waiting for permission of the Nawab. A few letters written by Siraj-ud-daulah to M. Busey, in the Dehli, had been intercepted by the English, and Siraj-ud-daulah was accused of breach of faith. The wrath of the Nawab at the crooked dealings and slow but steady advance of these foreigners increased daily.\" Mr.\nset out from Calcutta and to march to Pal\u0101si (Plassey). When\nthe moment for action had passed, Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah on hearing the\nWatts, the English Resident at Murshid\u0101b\u0101d, was threatened. The Nawab\nwent so far as to tear up a letter which Col. Clive had written to him. Soon\nafter, however, from fear of his false courtiers and want of confidence in his\nown army, he tried to pacify Mr. Watts by a Khilat, and wrote an excuse to\nClive. But Clive had already flung himself into the conspiracy headed by Mir\nJafar, to dethrone Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah. According to the Tar\u012bkh-i-Mansuri, the\nconspiracy was planned by Mir Mu\u1e25ammad Jafar, Aminchand Raura (generally\ncalled Omichand) and Khwajah Vizier, but according to the Seiru-l-\nMuta\u1e33kerin, by Mir Mu\u1e25ammad Jafar, Rajah Dulab Ram and Jagat Set, who\nhad each their agents in Calcutta. (See quotation from Seir given by me\nalready in this note). Clive treated with the conspirators through Mr. Watts.\nThe author then gives a description of Clive's double dealings with Aminchand\n(Omichand) as given in all histories of Bengal.\"\n\n\"Early in June 1757, Clive left Calcutta, reached on the 17th the small\ntown of Katwah, south of Plassey, and took possession of the fort of that\nplace.\n\nOn the 21st June, 4 p.m., Clive left Katwah, crossed the Hugli, and pitched\nhis tents on the morning of the 23rd, in the fields of Plassey. The Nawab's\narmy was now in sight. A cannonade commenced. The English attacked\nthe tents of Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah, but were vigorously opposed by Mir Madan (called\nMoodum Kh\u0101n in Thornton, Vol. I, p. 240), one of the Nawab's faithful\namirs. About 12 o'clock Mir Madan was struck by a cannon-ball and carried\nto Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah's tent, where he died. The fighting was, however, continued,\nMohanlal having taken Mir Madan's place. But nothing decisive was done. Afraid of a conspiracy Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah sent for Mir Jafar, who had\ntaken no part in the fight. After most earnest solicitations on the part of the\nNawab, Mir Jafar promised to fight the next day, on condition that Mohanlal\nshould be at once ordered to withdraw from the fight. Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah\nagreed, and Mohanlal returned to his tents. But no sooner did the troops see\ntheir General had left the field than they became hopeless and began to flee.\nBefore evening, the army of the Nawab had dispersed. This is the battle in\nwhich India was lost for Islam.\" See Blochmann's notes from the Tar\u012bkh-i-\nMansuri referred to above.\n\nThe Seiru-l-Muta\u1e33kerin's explanation regarding (p. 687, Vol. II), Clive's\nbreach of the treaty with Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah is apologetic in tone. The Seir\nstates that the English had joined Mir Jafar's conspiracy, but as this wise\nrace do not, without some substantial reason, engage in hostilities, or break\ntreaties, they must have entered into some correspondence with the Nawab,\nand advanced some good reason (of which the author was not aware) for\nbreaking the treaty of peace. Possibly the reason was found in the delay in\nthe payment of the Nawab's indemnity on account of the losses sustained\nby the English during the capture of Calcutta by Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah.\n\nI will now summarise the description of the battle of Plassey from the\nnews of the advance of the English troops, marched out of the City. Now taking out the cotton of recklessness from the ear,\n\nSeiru-l-Mutakherin (Vol. II, p. 638). On hearing of Clive's movement, Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah tried to conciliate his disaffected officers, who outwardly professed loyalty to him, but inwardly plotted his ruin. Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah sent Rajah Dulab Ram (the traitor) ahead to Plassey, to supervise the construction of redoubts and entrenchments, and shortly after moved up there himself, with his faithful officers, Mir Madan and Mohanlal and with the traitor, Mir Jafar. Clive also moved to Plassey with a small number of English Telengi troops, numbering about 2,000 in all. Clive commenced the battle with a brisk cannonade, whilst Mir Jafar stood by at a distance and watched the game. Mir Madan fought bravely till about 3 p.m., and steadily advanced with Mohanlal close to Clive's position. Seeing Mir Madan's gallantry, Clive, it is said, was dispirited and reproached Omichand for having falsely assured him that everyone was disaffected against the Nawab, and that no one would fight for the latter. As luck would however have it, at this time Mir Madan was hit by a cannonball and was removed to Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah's tent, where he died. Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah now becoming anxious sent for Mir Jafar, beseeched the latter to fight on his behalf, and even placed his turban before the latter, and addressed this arch-traitor as follows: \"I now repent of my deeds, and in the name of relationship that you bear to me, and in the name of the bounties that you received from my grandfather, Mah\u0101bat Jang, I entreat you to defend my life and honour.\" The pathetic appeal did not move the heart of this arch-traitor who still harboured his treacherous designs under the mask of friendship and who returned the following false answer: \"To-day is at its close, and the time for further fighting to-day is over. To-day, order the battle to cease; to-morrow I will fight for you with the whole army.\" Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah fell into Mir Jafar's trap, and sent a message to his Diwan, Mohanlal, who was continuing the fight after Mir Madan's fall, to return. Mohanlal said there was no time to return now, as he was in the thick of the fight, which would finally decide the fate. Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah consulted Mir Jafar, who cunningly repeated his former treacherous advice, and in consequence Mohanlal was summoned back. Mohanlal's return had a disastrous effect on Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah's army, who dispersed in all directions. Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah then returned swiftly to Murshidabad, halted for some time at Mansurganj, but found he was surrounded on all sides by false courtiers and traitors. So he left with his Begams and gold for Bhagwangolah, whence on boats he sailed for Azimabad sending at the same time a letter to Mons. Las to join him. Before Las's arrival, Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah was on his way to Patna. Owing to his Begams and children having had no food for some days, Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah, whom misfortune was dogging, landed at R\u0101jmahal, went to the house of a fakeer named Dana Shah, who undertook ostensibly to prepare Kh\u012bghr\u012b for him, but who inwardly harboured resentment against the Nawab, owing to previous ill-treatment. This fakeer promptly sent news of Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah's arrival to Mir D\u0101\u016bd (brother of Mir Jafar), who was at R\u0101jmahal. Mir D\u0101\u016bd and Mir Qasim Kh\u0101n\nthe displayed towards the aforesaid Kh\u0101n (Mir Jafar) battery and endearment, and sending the Begam of Mah\u0101bat Jang to Mir Jafar opened the gates of apology for his past shortcomings. Mir Jafar did not listen to them, as he had no reliance on Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah's assurances and actions. After this, when Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah advanced from Chhunakhkali, the aforesaid Kh\u0101n (Mir Jafar) also marching encamped at a distance of half a faras\u0101kh from the army of Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah. Mir Madam, Superintendent of the Artillery, told Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah that the English were coming at the instigation of Mir Muhammad Jafar, and that it was, therefore, expedient to finish first Mir Muhammad Jafar, and that after the latter was killed, the English would not have the daring to approach this side. In that the arrow of Fate cannot be parried by the shield of Effort, and in that God's decree had already been passed another way.\n\nTo the advice of that wise sage,\nThat light-hearted man (Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah) was deaf.\n\nWhen next day, Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah reached D\u0101\u016bdpur, tidings came (son-in-law of Mir Jafar), came and captured Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah, carried him to Murshid\u0101b\u0101d where he was murdered by Mir Jafar and his son Miran. Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah's corpse was placed on an elephant and paraded. The Seir winds up its account of this tragic murder of Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah with the following pathetic lines:\n\nI have already quoted the moral which the author of the Ibrat-i-Arbab-i-Ba\u1e63r draws from this tragic event. See n. ante.\n\nThis account compiled from Seir-ul-Muta\u1e25eerin, Riyazu-s-Salatin, Ibrat-i-Arbab-i-Ba\u1e63r, and Professor Blochmann's notes from Tarikh-i-Mansuri may profitably be compared with the accounts in Orme's History of the Military Transactions of the English, Mill's British India, and Thornton's British India (as suggested by Professor Blochmann in J.A.S., Part I, No. 2, 1867, p. 86).\nto the effect that the English had set fire to Katw\u0101h. At that time Mohanlal reproached Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah, and said: \"You have ruined me, and rendered my children orphans. If you had not removed Mir Mu\u1e25ammad Jafar Kh\u0101n and Dullab Ram from the Katw\u0101h outpost, things would not have taken this turn.\" In short, on the morning following that day, which was 5th Shaw\u0101l of the 3rd year of the reign of Emperor Alamgir II, the English army from Pal\u0101si (Plassey) on one side, and Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah from D\u0101\u016bdp\u016br on the other encountered each other, and opened the battle with a cannonade. Mir Mu\u1e25ammad Jafar Kh\u0101n, with his detachment, stood at a distance towards the left from the main army; and although Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah summoned him to his side, Mir Jafar did not move from his position. In the thick of the fighting, and in the heat of the work of carnage, whilst victory and triumph were visible on the side of the army of Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah, all of a sudden Mir Madan, commander of the Artillery, fell on being hit with a cannon-ball. At the sight of this, the aspect of Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah's army changed, and the artillerymen with the corpse of Mir Madan moved into tents. It was now midday, when the people of the tents fled. As yet Naw\u0101b Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah was busy fighting and slaughtering, when the camp-followers decamping from D\u0101\u016bdp\u016br went the other side, and gradually the soldiers also took to their heels. Two hours before sun-set, flight occurred in Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah's army, and Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah also being unable to stand his ground any longer fled. On arrival at Mans\u016brganj, which had been founded by him, he opened the Treasury gates and distributed money to the army. But owing to grave anxieties, being unable to halt there, the Naw\u0101b abandoning his treasures and effects, at nightfall, with his wives and children, got into a boat, carrying with himself a lot of precious jewelleries and gold coins, and sailed towards Purni\u0101l and Azim\u0101b\u0101d. After Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah's defeat, Mir Mu\u1e25ammad Jafar entered his camp, in the night held a conference with the English Chiefs, and early next morning marched in pursuit of Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah, and arrived in Murshid\u0101b\u0101d. Finding the sky propitious towards his views, Mir Jafar entered the citadel, struck up the music announcing his accession to the masnad of Bengal, issued proclamations of peace and security in the City, and unfurled the standard of \u0160\u016bbahd\u0101ri. Mir Jafar then detailed his son-in-law, Mir Mu\u1e25ammad Q\u0101sim with a corps to capture Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah, and quartered the Eng-\nBut Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah, travelling in the night, had sailed swiftly from below M\u0101ldah, and reached B\u0101bi\u0101l. When news reached him that the month of N\u0101zirpur was unnavigable and boats could not pass by that way, he was obliged to disembark, and went to the house of D\u0101n Sh\u0101h Pirz\u0101dah, whose house was at that place. D\u0101n Sh\u0101h who previous to this had suffered some injury at the hands of Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah, finding the latter in his power, and seeing the times favourable, by giving assurances and consolations, detained Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah in his house, and ostensibly engaging on preparing food, sent information to Mir D\u0101ud Ali Kh\u0101n, Faujd\u0101r of Akbarnagar (R\u0101jmahal), who was brother of Mir Muhammad Jafar Kh\u0101n. The spies of D\u0101ud Ali Kh\u0101n who were searching for Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah, fancying it to be a grand victory, swiftly arrived, and capturing Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah carried him from the house of D\u0101n Sh\u0101h to Akbarnagar, from whence the spies of D\u0101ud Ali Kh\u0101n and Mir Muhammad Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n carried him in their company to Murshidabad. Mir Muhammad Jafar Kh\u0101n threw Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah into prison that day. On the next day, with the advice of the English Chiefs, and on the opportunity and insistence of Jagat Set, he slew him, and suspending the corpse of that victim of oppression to a howdah on an elephant's back, sent it round the City, and then buried it in Khosh B\u0101gh in the Mausoleum of Naw\u0101b Mahabat Jang. After some days, Mir Jafar killed also Mirz\u0101 Mihdi Ali Kh\u0101n, the younger brother of Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah, by stretching him on an instrument of torture, and buried his body by the side of his brother's grave. The Niz\u0101mat of Naw\u0101b Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah lasted\n\n1 I am not sure if this word is correctly printed in the Pers. text.\n\n2 In B\u0113r, D\u0101na Sh\u0101h.\n\n3 I have noticed in a previous note the principal measures of Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah's administration.\n\n4 The Ibrat-i-Arb\u0101b-i-B\u0101r (p. 26) characterises Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah as 'light-hearted, unsparing, self-willed, petulant, short-tempered and sharp-tongued.' The Seiru-l-Mutak\u0101ber\u012bn (vol. II, p. 621) states in condemnation of Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah that Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah's harsh and uncouth utterances, his derision and jesting in respect of the officers of his Government caused resentment in their hearts. If this be what constituted the head and front of his offending, \u2014if this be what exhausts the catalogue of his sins, then one has to materially modify the generally current view of Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah.\n\nThe explanation accounting for the tragic fate of Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah is, however, attempted by the author of the Ibrat-i-Arb\u0101b-i-B\u0101r (p. 92). This author\none year and four months, and he was slain at the end of the month of Shaw\u0101l 1170 A.H.\n\nNIZ\u0100MAT OF SHUJ\u0100U-L-MULK JAFAR ALI KH\u00c2N.\n\nWhen Jafar Ali Kh\u00e2n ascended\u00b9 the masnad of the Niz\u0101mat of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa, he set himself to the conciliation of the states, in effect, that Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah was a victim of intrigues and misfortunes left as a legacy by his grandfather, Ali Vardi Kh\u00e2n, who had inaugurated in Bengal an era of violent intrigues and dark treachery, by killing his own master, Nawab Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u00e2n (son of Ali Vardi's benefactor, Nawab Shujau-d-din Kh\u00e2n), and who was, therefore, now punished by an Avenging Providence in the person of his grandson Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah, whom Ali Vardi had regarded as dearer than his own life. That Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah did not bring on the misfortunes on himself by his own incapacity, is proved by what the Seiru-l-Mutakkerin (Vol. II, p. 633), states, namely, that 'Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah had attained the zenith of power and opulence, and that, therefore, a declension was inevitable according to the laws of nature.'\n\nThis Revolution in the history of Bengal which in effect supplanted Moslem Rule and made the English virtually supreme in this country, may also be viewed in another aspect as a wise Dispensation of Providence for the ultimate good of the people. At the time, it is abundantly clear, the people in Bengal were sunk in the abyss of moral debasement, and the cankers of dark ingratitude and treachery, untruthfulness and venality had crept deep into the vitals of their hearts. In the pursuit of the phantoms of individual self-aggrandisement and of personal ambitions, they had taken advantage of the youthful failings of their sovereign and of the internecine jealousies that distracted his family, forgotten and forsaken all sentiments of gratitude and honour, and yielded to their instinct of intrigue by fraternising with the Nawab's disloyal relation, Mir Jafar. These, therefore, verily needed a Chastener\u2014a Moses\u2014to save them from further moral dissolution; and so Providence in His inscrutable wisdom sent to them One from across the seas in the person of the English, to scourge the vices of the land, to chasten the people, to purify and re-form them, and to once more, if possible, to rescue them from the sea of moral annihilation.\n\n\u00b9 See the account in the Seir (Vol. II, p. 640). After the battle of Plassey, Mir Jafar and Clive had a conference on the battlefield, and they together entered Murshidabad. Mir Jafar occupied the palace of Mangurganj, which was the residence of Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah, and then visited the Nizamat Treasury, in order to distribute the treasures between himself, Dulab Ram, and Clive, as had been agreed to mutually. Dulab Ram now became Mir Jafar's most influential colleague in the administration. Their friendship, however, did not last long, and shortly after Dulab Ram contemplated placing Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah's brother, Mir\u0101b Mahdi, on the masnad. See Seir, Vol. II, Pers. text, p. 644).\narmy and the nobility, who had joined him in his conspiracy to destroy Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah. He appointed his nephew, Kh\u0101dim Husain Kh\u0101n, to the office of Faujd\u0101r of Purniah, and conferred on R\u0101mnar\u0101in a robe of honour, confirming him in the Deputy-Governorship of the \u0160\u016bbah of Az\u012bm\u0101b\u0101d (Patna).\n\nAt this time Sh\u0101h Alam invaded the \u0160\u016bbah of Az\u012bm\u0101b\u0101d.\n\n1 See Seir (Vol. II, p. 645), for an account of Khadem Husain Kh\u0101n. Khadem Husain Kh\u0101n's father, Syed Khadem Ali Kh\u0101n, was husband of Mir Jafar's sister, but Khadem Husain was not from this sister, but born of another wife of Khadem. Khadem Husain was a boon companion of Mir Jafar, who was fond of pleasures and carousals (p. 645, Vol. II, Seir).\n\n2 Mir Jafar was quite incompetent for the office of \u0160ubadar of Bengal. As soon as he ascended the masnad of the Nigamat, he flung himself into pleasures, neglected State affairs, and left them in the hands of his son, Miran, and others. Jahangir Nagar or Dacca fell into the hands of R\u0101jballab, Diwan of Miran; this R\u0101jballab in the time of the late Shahamat Jang was peshkar of Shahamat Jang's Diwan, Hussain Quli Kh\u0101n. Bardw\u0101n and some other districts were ceded to the English, in lieu of cash payment of a part of the Bengal revenue. Hugli was assigned to Mir Beg Kh\u0101n, who had rendered good services to the English. Rajah R\u0101mnar\u0101in became supreme administrator of Bih\u0101r, whilst Purniah was bestowed on Khadem Hussain Kh\u0101n. (See Seir, Vol. II, p. 651). It is stated in the Seir that shortly after Mir Jafar's accession, people got tired of him and his son Miran, and sighed back for the old days of Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah, whom they regarded now as better in all respects than Mir Jafar (Seiru-l-Mutakkerin, Vol. II, p. 656).\n\n3 A detailed account of this will be found in the Seiru-l-Mutakkerin, Vol. II, p. 656. It appears that many of the noblemen in Bih\u0101r and Bengal soon got into thorough disgust with Mir Jafar and his son, Miran, and opened correspondence with Mu\u1e25ammad Quli Kh\u0101n, \u0160ubadar of Allahabad (a cousin of Shujan-d-daulah, and a nephew of Safdar Jang). Mu\u1e25ammad Quli Kh\u0101n took counsel with his cousin, Shujan-d-daulah, \u0160ubadar of Oudh, who inwardly harboured ill-feeling towards his cousin and aimed at his ruin, gave him false advice, and encouraged him to invade Bih\u0101r and to carry with him Prince Ali Gauhar, surnamed Sh\u0101h Alam (who was heir of Emperor Alamgir II). Ali Gauhar was harassed at this time by Imadu-l-Mulk, and was staying with Najibu-d-daulah Najib Kh\u0101n Afghan at Miranpur, Gh\u0101turah. At first R\u0101mnar\u0101in, Deputy-Governor of Bih\u0101r, took counsel with Mr. Amytt, the Chief of the English Factory at Patna, enquired what course of action he should adopt, and suggested that the English should help him in opposing Prince Ali Gauhar's invasion. Mr. Amytt said he could give no decisive answer. Finding that no help was coming from the Nazim of Bengal, Mir Jafar, nor from the English, R\u0101mnar\u0101in became anxious, opened political courtesies with Prince Gauhar and Mu\u1e25ammad Quli Kh\u0101n, waited on them in Darbar, and professed allegiance to the Prince. Both the Prince and Mu\u1e25ammad Quli\nRahim Kh\u0101n and Q\u0101dird\u0101d Kh\u0101n, &c., sons of Umar Kh\u0101n, and Ghul\u0101m Sh\u0101h and other commanders and generals in the service\n\nKh\u0101n being thus re-assured, let R\u0101mnar\u0101in return to the fort of A\u1e63im\u0101b\u0101d. Shortly after, on getting news of the approach of Miran and the English, R\u0101mnar\u0101in threw off his mask of loyalty to the Prince and Muhammad Quli Kh\u0101n. The latter pressed the siege of Patna, assaulted the Fort, and R\u0101mnar\u0101in being hardpressed was about to surrender and run away. Then news arriving that Shuj\u0101n-d-daulah by a foul trick had made himself master of the Fort of Allahabad, which was held by his cousin Muhammad Quli Kh\u0101n, the latter together with Prince Ali Gauhar abandoned the siege of Patna, and withdrew towards Allahabad. (See p. 669, Seir, Vol. II). At this time, Mons. Las met the Prince, persuaded the latter to attack again Patna, but the latter acknowledged his inability to do so, owing to want of funds. If, at this time, Shuj\u0101n-d-daulah, instead of being meanly treacherous to his cousin, had supported him, the fate of Bihar might have been different. See Mons. Las's observations on the point quoted in the Seir (Vol. II, p. 670).\n\nAt Benares, Muhammad Quli Kh\u0101n's march was opposed under orders of Shuj\u0101n-d-daulah, whilst Prince Ali Gauhar with Mons. Las was allowed to pass on via Mirzapur to Chattarpur towards Bundelkund. Muhammad Quli Kh\u0101n was carried to Shuj\u0101n-d-daulah who had the meanness to imprison him.\n\nIn the meantime, Miran with Col. Clive came to Patna, and R\u0101mnar\u0101in waited on them, whilst apparently amicable relations were opened between them and Prince Ali Gauhar, through the diplomatic correspondence of Ghul\u0101m Husain Kh\u0101n, author of the Seir. (See Seir, Vol. II, p. 674).\n\nShortly after, on the invitation of Diler Kh\u0101n and Kamgar Kh\u0101n, Zamindar of Tirhut Samai, Prince Ali Gauhar again invaded Patna. At this time, the English army under Captain Cockrane supported R\u0101mnar\u0101in. Mr. Amytt was still the Chief of the English Factory at Patna, whilst Dr. Fullerton was attached to the Factory as the medical officer. The author of the Seir (Ghul\u0101m Husain Kh\u0101n) was a friend of Dr. Fullerton, and was the latter's guest at the time. (See Seir, Vol. II, p. 676). At this time Emperor Alamgir II was treacherously murdered under orders of Imadu-l-Mulk (See Seir, Vol. II, p. 676), and Ali Gauhar consulted Ghul\u0101m Husam Kh\u0101n's father, who resided at the time in Hussainabad in Bih\u0101r Province and proclaimed himself Emperor under the title of Sh\u0101h Alam in 1173, A.H., appointed Shuj\u0101n-d-daulah as his Vizier, and Najibu-d-daulah as his General. Then Kamgar Kh\u0101n Muin and A\u1e63alat Kh\u0101n and Diler Kh\u0101n met the Emperor, and induced the latter to invade Bih\u0101r. At this time, R\u0101mnar\u0101in was encamped on the banks of the river Dhanab. At this battle, Sh\u0101h Alam defeated R\u0101mnar\u0101in, who was wounded. The English army who supported R\u0101mnar\u0101in and were led by Captain Cockrane and Mr. Barwal, were also defeated and dispersed; and Patna fell into the hands of the Emperor. (See Seir, Vol. II, p. 678). At this battle, Diler Kh\u0101n and A\u1e63alat Kh\u0101n, sons of Umar Kh\u0101n, fought and fell heroically on the side of the Emperor. Shortly after, Miran, with the English troops under Colonel Clive arrived. On the side of the Emperor, Kam-\nof Sirajuddaulah, whom Jafar Ali Khan had previously from policy shifted to the province of Bihar, now joined the Imperial Army. At Fatuhah, a battle took place between the Imperialists and Ramnarain. Ramnarain was wounded, and fled to the fort, and the Imperial troops laid siege to the fort. Nawab Jafar Ali Khan, on getting this news, despatched to Bihar his son, Nawab Nasirul-Mulk Sadiq Ali Khan Shahmat Jang, surnamed Miran, with a detachment of English troops. On the banks of the river Adhunah, adjoining Barh, a battle ensued with the Imperialists. On the side of the Imperialists, Qadirdad Khan and Kamgar Khan displayed feats of bravery. Muhammad Amin Khan was wounded, whilst Rajballab fell back, and both contemplated flight. Qadirdad Khan, with others, by brave onslaughts, attacked the lines of artillery. A heavy gun, which required to be drawn by 400 bullocks, happened to lie in front of these. Those men got entangled amidst the bullocks, and failed to cut through as the bullocks hemmed them on all sides. At this juncture, the elephant-driver of Qadirdad Khan was shot by a bullet. Qadirdad gar Khan, Qadirdad Khan, Ghulam Shah were the Generals. Qadirdad Khan made a bold movement to the rear of Miran, heroically fought, killed Muhammad Amin Khan (maternal uncle of Miran), wounded Miran, and worked havoc in Miran's army. Miran fled. Then the English opened a brisk cannonade, and one cannon-ball hit Qadirdad Khan who was killed. Then the tide of victory turned in favour of Miran, whilst Kamgar Khan, with the Emperor, proceeded towards Bihar. (Seir, Vol. II, p. 680). Now Kamgar Khan, with the Emperor, contemplated surprising Murshidabad, and proceeded to Bardwan. Mir Jafar, with the English army and his own troops, proceeded to Bardwan. Kamgar Khan with the Emperor now turned back towards Azimabad, while Mons. Las also arrived. (Seir, Vol. II, p. 680). At this time Khadim Hasain Khan and Dulab Ram (who had got sick of his old fellow-conspirator, Mir Jafar) sent help secretly to the Emperor. The Emperor and Kamgar Khan with Mons. Las and Zainuddin Khan now assaulted the fort of Patna. The assaults were vigorously repeated, and the fort was about to fall, when a company of English troops under Captain Knox brought timely reinforcement, and raised the siege. The Emperor with Kamgar Khan now went some distance from Patna, and was busy collecting revenue. In the meantime, Khadim Husain, who bore an old grudge to Miran, moved to Hajipur with a large number of troops to attack Patna, but was defeated by Captain Knox who was supported by Shitab Rai (Seir, Vol. II, p. 685). Shortly after Miran, with Colonel Olive and another English army, arrived, and pursued Khadim Husain Khan, who felt himself too weak to oppose their united forces, and retired towards Bitiah, where of a night Miran was killed by lightning, whilst sleeping in his tent. (See Seir, Vol. II, p. 685):\nKh\u0101n spurred on his elephant with his feet, and shot arrows. Naw\u0101b Sadiq Ali Kh\u0101n received a wound, being hit by an arrow. At this moment, a big cannon-ball hit Q\u0101dirdad Kh\u0101n on the left side of the chest, and finished him up. On seeing this mishap, K\u0101mg\u0101r Kh\u0101n and others reining back their horses fell back to their own lines. The army of Sadiq Ali Kh\u0101n, on ascertaining this, made a fresh onslaught, attacked the Imperialists, and struck up the music of victory. The Imperialists were defeated. Rahim Kh\u0101n and Zainu-l-Abidin Kh\u0101n, who had made a detour towards the rear of Sadiq Ali Kh\u0101n\u2019s army, on hearing the music of victory, made a flank movement towards the right wing, and attacked it. But owing to the cannonade of the English artillery, they were unable to stand their ground, and were defeated. After defeat, the Imperialists retired towards Bardw\u0101n, and Sadiq \u2018Ali Kh\u0101n, pursuing them, followed them up to Bardw\u0101n via Qhakai,1 Khanti,2 and Birbh\u016bm. From this side, Jafar \u2018Ali Kh\u0101n also marched expeditiously to Bardw\u0101n, and on the banks of the river3 below the town of Bardw\u0101n, a battle commenced with a cannonade. The Imperialists not being able to hold their own there, marched back to Azim\u0101b\u0101d.\n\nJafar \u2018Ali Kh\u0101n and Sadiq Ali Kh\u0101n now set themselves to confiscate the treasures and effects of Naw\u0101b Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah and the Begams of Mah\u0101bat Jang, etc. Rendering the latter hard up for even a night\u2019s sustenance, they had already sent to Jah\u0101ngirnagar (Dacca), the Begam of Mah\u0101bat Jang with her two daughters, one named Amanah Begam,4 mother of Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah, and the other named Ghasiti Begam, widow of Shah\u0101mat Jang, together with other ladies of Mah\u0101bat Jang\u2019s harem. Jafar \u2018Ali Kh\u0101n and Sadiq Ali Kh\u0101n now sent B\u0101qir Kh\u0101n, the General, to Jah\u0101ngirnagar (Dacca) with a corps of one hundred cavalry, and wrote to Jasrat Kh\u0101n, Fanjdar of Jah\u0101ngirnagar, peremptorily directing the latter to capture and make over Ghasiti Begam and\n\n1 In the printed Persian text \u2018Jakai,\u2019 which would apparently seem to be a misreading or misprint for Qhakai, in Moughyr district, which would be on the line of route.\n2 \u2018Khanti,\u2019 or Contai is in Midnapur district. I think this must be a misprint or misreading in the Pers. printed text, as Khanti does not appear to lie on the line of route from Bihar to Bardw\u0101n; probably Kandi is meant.\n3 That is to say, Damdar river.\n4 In Seiru-l-Mutakherin, \u2018Amanah Begam,\u2019\nAminah Begam to B\u0101qir Kh\u0101n, as soon as the latter arrived. On the arrival of B\u0101qir Kh\u0101n at Jah\u0101ng\u012brnagar, Jas\u0101rat Kh\u0101n was obliged to pass the necessary orders. The Begams were placed on a boat, which was taken out some karoh from Jah\u0101ng\u012brnagar and there sunk in the river. It is said that when the Begams were taken out to the boat, and became aware of their fate, they repeated their prayers, held the Holy Qor\u0101n in their armpits, embraced each other, and then plunged into the river. O, Gracious God, what inhuman barbarity was this! But at length, Sadiq Ali Kh\u0101n also suffered retribution for it in his own life-time.\n\nAt this time a misunderstanding had set in between Sadiq Ali Kh\u0101n and Kh\u0101dim Husain Kh\u0101n, on account of levy of revenue and also of other matters. Sadiq Ali Kh\u0101n, resolving to expel and extinguish Kh\u0101dim Husain Kh\u0101n, planned an expedition to Purniah. Kh\u0101dim Husain Kh\u0101n advancing with his troops from Purniah, entrenched himself at Gandahgolah (Caragola) for fighting. Then, all of a sudden, news arrived that the Imperialists had besieged the fort of Azim\u0101b\u0101d (Patna), and were fighting with R\u0101mnar\u0101sin. Consequently, Sadiq Ali Kh\u0101n, abandoning his contemplated expedition to Purniah, set out for Azim\u0101b\u0101d. Kh\u0101dim Husain Kh\u0101n, not considering himself a match for him, set out for the Imperial Capital. From this (i.e., the southern) side of the Ganges, the army of Sadiq Ali Kh\u0101n, and from that (i.e., the northern) side of the Ganges, Kh\u0101dim Husain Kh\u0101n\n\n1 To the credit of Jas\u0101rat Kh\u0101n, Faujdar of Dacca or Jah\u0101ng\u012brnagar, it is related in the Seir that he had declined to be a party to such a diabolical murder, and had offered to resign his post. It appears from the Seir M\u012br Jafar subsequently hoaxed Jas\u0101rat Kh\u0101n, and induced the latter to make over to B\u0101qir Kh\u0101n the two Begams, on the plea that they would be safely lodged at Murshid\u0101b\u0101d, now that Miran had left that place for Bib\u0101r.\n\n2 That M\u012br Jafar and his son, Miran, were despicable tyrants, is sufficiently attested by this diabolical murder. There is nothing to match such inhuman barbarity in the record of the much-abused Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah. See Seiru-l-Mutakherin, Vol. II, p. 689. It appears Aminah Begam, before plunging into the river, prayed to God that Miran might meet with retribution and be killed by lightning for his barbarous inhumanity in causing her and her sister's death. It is further stated in the Seir that Miran was killed by lightning in his tent the same night that Ghasit\u012b Begam and Aminah Begam (daughters of Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n Mah\u0101bat Jang, and wives of Shahamat Jang and Haibat Jang respectively) met with a watery grave in the river below Dacca.\nmarched up. And when news of the approach of \u015eadiq Ali Kh\u0101n spread at Azim\u0101b\u0101d, the Imperialists raising the siege of the fort of Patna retired by the highway towards Munir. \u015eadiq Ali Kh\u0101n, thus finding himself at leisure, crossed the river, and marched in pursuit of Kh\u0101dim Husain Kh\u0101n. Kh\u0101dim Husain Kh\u0101n marched forward with the swiftness of lightning and wind, whilst \u015eadiq Ali Kh\u0101n hotly pursued him from behind, making forced marches. At this juncture, a storm of wind and rain came on and disabled both the horsemen and the horses from action. Kh\u0101dim Husain Kh\u0101n reached the bank of a river,\\(^1\\) to ford which was difficult, and to cross which without a ferry boat was impossible. The army of Kh\u0101dim Husain Kh\u0101n, like the Israelites of old, finding the river in front and the enemy in the rear, despaired of life. Finding all ways of escape cut off, Kh\u0101dim Husain Kh\u0101n of necessity flung his treasures and heavy baggages amongst his soldiers, and placing his trust in his God and looking up to the Infallible Artist, looked out for supernatural help. The army of \u015eadiq Ali Kh\u0101n, having had to march through mud and clay and being drenched through by a heavy shower of rain, were rendered unfit for fighting, and halted that day at a distance of 2 karoh from Kh\u0101dim Husain Kh\u0101n. In that cup of the life of Kh\u0101dim Husain Kh\u0101n and his companions was yet not full to the brim, at midnight a lightning fell on \u015eadiq Ali Kh\u0101n, and killed him and his personal attendant. This mishap occurred in 1173 A.H. Kh\u0101dim Husain Kh\u0101n, thus getting providentially rescued from the claws of certain death, marched away with the speed of lightning and wind, and went to the \u015eubah of Audh (Oudh). R\u0101jballab\\(^2\\) and other comrades of \u015eadiq Ali Kh\u0101n rubbed the ashes of sorrow and anguish on their heads, and together with the English army retired to Azim\u0101b\u0101d. There they directed their attention towards the Imperial army, including the Emperor's Mahratta Contingent, who were encamped at Hilsab, and commenced warfare. The Imperialists were again defeated, and the French General\\(^3\\) who was in the company of\n\n---\n\n1 This was the river Gandak, as would appear from the description in the Seir.\n2 R\u0101jballab, a native of Dacca, was Peshkar of Hussain Quli Kh\u0101n, whilst the latter was Diw\u0101n of Shahamat Jang in Dacca. After Hussain Quli Kh\u0101n's death, R\u0101jballab rose to be Diw\u0101n of Shahamat Jang. He was continued in the same office under Miran.\n3 This was Mons. Las, as would appear from the Seir.\nthe Emperor was captured, whilst R\u0101jballab followed up to Bih\u0101r. When the Imperialists marched towards Gya-Manp\u016br and K\u0101mg\u0101r Kh\u0101n fled to the hills, R\u0101jballab thought of returning. But at this moment, news arrived to the effect that Naw\u0101b Jafar Ali Kh\u0101n was a prisoner, and that Naw\u0101b Q\u0101sim Ali Kh\u0101n had acquired the \u0160ubah of Bengal, as will be related hereafter. The period of the Niz\u0101mat of Naw\u0101b Mir Mu\u1e25ammad Jafar Ali Kh\u0101n lasted about three years.\n\n---\n\nNIZ\u0100MAT OF \u0100LIJAH NA\u1e62\u012aRU-L-MULK IMTI\u0100ZU-D-DAULAH Q\u0100SIM ALI KH\u0100N BAHADUR NA\u1e62RAT JANG.\n\nNaw\u0101b Jafar Ali Kh\u0101n had sent to Calcutta his kinsman, Mir Mu\u1e25ammad Q\u0101sim, who was a son of Naw\u0101b Imti\u0101z Kh\u0101n, surnamed Kh\u0101l\u012bq, to represent him at the Conference regarding the Administration and settlement of the apportionment of 10 annas of the revenue to Jafar Ali Kh\u0101n and six annas to the English, and regarding the enjoyment of the office of Diw\u0101n by Jafar Ali Kh\u0101n. On the death of \u1e62adiq Ali Kh\u0101n, the Army demanding their pay which had fallen into arrear for some years mutinied in a body, besieged the Naw\u0101b in the Chihil Sat\u016bn Palace, and cut off supplies of food and water. In consequence, the Naw\u0101b wrote to Mir Mu\u1e25ammad Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n to the effect that the army had reduced him to straits for demand of arrear pay. Mir Mu\u1e25ammad Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n, in concert with Jagat Set, conspired with the English Chiefs, and induced the latter to write to Naw\u0101b Jafar Ali Kh\u0101n to the effect that the mutiny of the army for\n\n---\n\n1 Mir Q\u0101sim was a son-in-law of Mir Jafar, who had conferred on the former the Faujdari of Purniah in addition to that of Rangpur. Mir Q\u0101sim went on some State business to Calcutta, and there made an impression on Mr. Vansittart, who had now succeeded Clive as Governor of Calcutta. At this time, the pay of the army being in arrear, the latter besieged Mir Jafar in his palace. With the help of the English Council in Calcutta, Mir Q\u0101sim now became Nazim of Bengal, Bih\u0101r, and Orissa, in supercession of Mir Jafar, who had proved himself an incapable ruler. (See Seir, Vol. II, p. 695). Mir Q\u0101sim owed his installation chiefly to Mr. Vansittart, the Governor of Calcutta, and his colleague in the Council, Mr. Hastings, both of whom went for the purpose to Murshid\u0101b\u0101d. Mir Jafar came to Calcutta and remained there under surveillance.\n\n2 In the Seir, it is stated Mir Q\u0101sim was a son of Syed Murtaza, who was a son of Imtiaz Kh\u0101n, surnamed Kh\u0101l\u012bq.\ndemand of pay was a very serious matter, and that it was ad-\nvisable that the Naw\u00e2b abandoning the Fort should come down\nto Calcutta, entrusting the Fort and the \u015eubah to Mir Mu\u1e25ammad\nQ\u0101sim Kh\u00e2n.\u00b9 Mir Mu\u1e25ammad Q\u0101sim with full self-confidence,\non attaining his aim, returned to Murshid\u0101b\u0101d. The English\nChiefs leagueing with Mir Mu\u1e25ammad Q\u0101sim Kh\u00e2n brought out\nNaw\u00e2b Jafar Kh\u00e2n from the Fort, placed him on a boat, and\nsent him down to Calcutta. Mir Q\u0101sim Kh\u00e2n entered the Fort,\nmounted the masnad of Niz\u0101mat, and issued proclamations of\npeace and security in his own name. He sent a message to R\u0101j-\nballab\u00b2 to bring back the Emperor to Azim\u0101b\u0101d, whilst he himself\nafterwards set out for Azim\u0101b\u0101d, in order to wait on the Emperor,\nafter attending to and reassuring his army, and making some\nsettlement in regard to their arrears of pay. Leaving his uncle,\nMir Tur\u0101b Ali Kh\u00e2n, as Deputy Nazim in Murshid\u0101b\u0101d, Mir\nQ\u0101sim carried with himself all his effects, requisites, elephants,\nhorses, and treasures comprising cash and jewelleries of the\nharem, and even gold and silver decorations of the Im\u0101mb\u0101ra,\namounting to several laks in value, and bade farewell to the\ncountry of Bengal. After arriving at Monghyr, and attending\nto the work of strengthening its fortifications,\u00b3 he marched to\n\n\u00b9 Mir Jafar proved himself thoroughly incapable. In whatever light his\ncharacter is viewed, he appears to have been much worse than the much-\nabused Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah. Though much older than the latter, Mir Jafar was\nunquestionably inferior to the latter in qualities both of head and heart,\nAs a general or an administrator, Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah was superior to him,\nwhilst as a man, Sir\u0101ju-d-daulah was much better than Mir Jafar or his\ninfamous son, Miran. The Seir states that shortly after the Revolution,\neven Mir Jafar's old adherents sighed back for the days of Sir\u0101ju-d-\ndaulah. Mir Jafar was even incapable of retaining the friendships or\nattachments of his fellow-conspirators, Dulab Ram and Jagat Set. After as-\ncending the masnad of Nizamat, Mir Jafar gave himself up to pleasures\nand debaucheries, though he was an elderly man, and neglected State affairs\nwhich fell into confusion. Mr. Vansittart and Mr. Hastings contemplated at\nfirst that Mir Jafar should be allowed to retain his titles and privileges as the\nNazim of Bengal, whilst Mir Q\u0101sim should act as Administrator-General or\nRegent on his behalf. In this arrangement, Mir Jafar refused to acquiesce, and\nso he was brought down a prisoner to Calcutta, whilst Mir Q\u0101sim was pro-\nclaimed Naw\u00e2b Nazim of Bengal, Bih\u0101r, and Orissa. (See Seir, Vol. II, p. 695.)\n\u00b2 R\u0101jballab was at this time in Patna in charge of Miran's army, as Miran\nhad been killed by lightning.\n\u00b3 From the Seir, Vol. II, Pers. text, p. 711, it appears that Mir Q\u0101sim went\nAzimabad (Patna), in order to wait on the Emperor. Before Mir Qasim's arrival at Azimabad, the Emperor had returned to that place, and the English going forward to receive him had accommodated His Majesty in their own Factory. Subsequently, Qasim Ali Khan also arrived, had the honour of an audience with the Emperor, and received from the latter the title of Nawab Ali Jah Nasirul-mulk Imtiazu-d-daulah Qasim Ali Khan Nasrat Jang. But the officers of the Emperor marking some change in the conduct of Qasim Ali Khan marched back with the Emperor to Banaras, without giving any intimation thereof to the aforesaid Khan. Nawab Qasim Ali Khan followed\n\nto Monghyr and resided there in 1175 A.H., after having finished his expeditions to Tirhut, Shahabad, and Azimabad, and after having left Rajah Naubat Rai as Deputy Subadar of Patna, in place of Ramnarain and Rajballab who were imprisoned. (See Seir, Vol. II, p. 711). Two days every week, the Nawab dispensed justice, attended personally to every State affair, and listened patiently to the complaints and grievances of everyone, however humble his position, and did not permit corruption or bribery to thwart the course of justice. He paid assiduous attention to the happiness of his people and to the comfort of his army, which he placed in a highly efficient state. He was, however, a terror to enemies and wrong-doers, and his vigorous personality pervaded all affairs of the State. Friends and foes alike respected him, and even the English regarded him as a real power in the land, and not as a shadow like Mir Jafar. He respected learning and the learned, and appreciated the company of scholars, savants, and saints. The one fatal mistake that he made was that he trusted implicitly the Armenian cut-throat, Gurgan Khan, who was the generalissimo of his Army and who was secretly bent on ruining him, and this one fatal mistake which embroiled him in a quarrel with the English subsequently proved disastrous to his power. See Seirul-Mutakherin, Vol. II, p. 712.\n\n1 It appears the English General, Major Carnac, concluded a truce with the Emperor, established amicable relations with him, and induced the latter to come to Patna. At this time, the moves of the pawns on the political chessboard of India were quick and strange and inconsistent. Everyone was after his game of self-interest, regardless of traditions and of sentiments. (See Seir, Vol. II, pp. 700, 703-704). At this time Ahmad Shah Abdali had again invaded India, defeated the Mahrattas, and instructed Shujan-d-daulah, Najibu-d-daulah and other Afghans to show allegiance to Emperor Shah Alam who was his brother-in-law. (See Seir, Vol. II, p. 706).\n\n2 There does not appear to be any authority for this statement. It would appear that agreeably to the instruction left by Ahmad Shah Abdali who had inflicted a crushing defeat on the Mahrattas, Shujan-d-daulah, Subadar of Oudh, had come at the time to the borders of Oudh, to receive the Emperor\nthem up to the confines of Baksar and Jagadishpur, and after pillaging those places returned to Azimabad, halted at the residence of Ramnarain, and set himself to the work of administration of the affairs of that place.\n\nWhen Qasim Ali Khan demanded from the English duties on their trade-goods, the latter refused to pay the same, and carried on their trade duty-free. Nawab Qasim Ali Khan Shah Alam and to escort him to Delhi, to instal him on his ancestral throne. See Seiru-l-Mutakkerin, Vol. II, pp. 705-706.\n\n1 Important administrative changes transpired at this time. Nawab Mir Qasim called for accounts from Ramnarain, who was Deputy Subadar of Behar. Finding that Ramnarain had been guilty of malversation in respect of large amounts of the public revenues, the Nawab dismissed him from office and threw him into prison, at the same time confiscating all his treasures. Shitab Rai, who was Ramnarain's colleague, was also suspected, and dismissed by the Nawab, who took into his own hands the direct administration of Behar, retaining, however, Rajballab as his Deputy there. See Seir, Vol. II, p. 707. Subsequently Rajballab was thrown into prison, his office being given to Rajah Nanbat Rai, who was replaced shortly after by Mir Mehdi Khan. Gurgan Khan, an Armenian, was placed at the head of the Artillery, and the Nawab placed implicit confidence in him. But as later events would show, this Armenian proved a traitor. The Nawab employed a large number of spies, and thus kept himself well informed of everything that transpired. He also appointed Mir Mehdi Khan as Fanjdar of Tirhut, and Muhammad Taqi Khan as Fanjdar of Birbhum.\n\n2 This was the beginning and ostensible cause of the rupture between Nawab Qasim Ali and the English. The Seir (Vol. II, p. 715), details these important events. In 1176 A.H., Mr. Henry Vansittart, then acting as Governor of the English East India Company in Calcutta, visited the Nawab at Monghyr, and held a conference with him on various matters. The Nawab then told Mr. Vansittart that much trade passed through the country duty-free, as it was given out that it was on behalf of the English, that in consequence the State suffered a heavy loss, and that it was proper that duty should be levied on all such goods, except those particularly belonging to the English East India Company. Mr. Vansittart informed the Nawab not to do anything in the matter in haste, but to wait till his return to Calcutta, when proper orders on the subject would be passed by him and communicated to the Nawab. The Nawab on the strength of this felt sanguine that his request would be complied with, and in the meantime wrote to his Collectors (Amils), directing them to be vigilant in regard to permitting goods to pass duty-free, and adding that full orders would be communicated to them hereafter. These Amils in some cases exceeded their authority by stopping goods, with the result that several of them were imprisoned by Mr. Ellison, of the Patna Factory, and by Mr. Batteson, of the Dacca Factory, and sent to Calcutta. The Nawab, on hearing this, directed reprisals, and ordered the arrest of the gomash-\nremitted thereupon the duties leviable from all the traders of Bengal and Behar, and declared that so long as he failed to levy duties from the rich, he would hold back his hand from doing so, in the case of the poor. Owing to this cause, and owing to some other matters, a misunderstanding set in between him and the English chiefs. The Nawab now hatched plans for exterminating them. At length, he formed the resolution of putting them all to the sword on one day. In pursuance of this plan, he sent despatches to his Deputies and Faujdars in Bengal to the effect that on a certain fixed date everywhere, they should by means of treachery or violence massacre all the English residents. And after personally giving peremptory injunctions to the Generals of his army to kill and capture and pillage and plunder the English, he returned to Monghyr. And when on the day fixed, the army of Qasim Ali Khan prepared to discharge their commissioned task, a battle\n\ntas of the English, and remitted duties on all goods, explaining that when the goods of richer traders were to be exempt from duties, it would be inequitable to levy duties on goods of poorer traders who contributed only a fraction to the State revenue. The Council in Calcutta sent Mr. Amytt as their envoy to the Nawab to Monghyr to settle matters (p. 720, Seir, Vol. II). Mr. Vansittart also sent a friendly letter to the Nawab requesting the latter to concede the demand of the Council. The Nawab consulted his general, the Armenian Gurgan Khan, who advised the Nawab not to listen to Mr. Vansittart's advice (p. 760, Seir, Vol. II). In the meantime, Gurgan Khan had caused the flower of the Nawab's Army to perish in a fruitless expedition for the conquest of Nepal (p. 717, Vol. II, Seir.) The Nawab now solicited aid from Nawab Vizier Shuja-d-danlah and the Emperor, in order to repel the encroachments of the English (p. 718, Seir, Vol. II). The Nawab also wrote to his capable and loyal Faujdar of Birbhum, Muhammad Taqi Khan, to send Jagat Set Mahtab Rai and his brother, Maharaja Surupchand, grandsons of Jagat Set Fatehchand, from Murshidabad to Monghyr under proper escort, and Muhammad Taqi Khan accordingly sent them to Monghyr, where they were ordered to reside under surveillance (p. 721, Seir, Vol. II). On hearing that Mr. Amytt was coming to Monghyr, the Nawab sent Mir Abdullah and Ghulam Husain Khan (author of the Seir), who were intimate with Mr. Amytt, to go and receive him, and to enquire into the object of his mission. (See Seir, Vol. II, p. 712). Mr. Amytt's mission proved a failure (See Seir, Vol. II, p. 742).\n\n1 The Riyas's account is not quite accurate. What actually happened is detailed in the Seir, the author of which was an actor in these scenes. (See Seir, Vol. II, p. 725). It appears that before the Council in Calcutta had decided anything, on Mr. Amytt's return, Mr. Amytt on his own responsibility had written from Monghyr to Mr. Ellison, Chief of the Patna Factory, to\nensued with the English army. At length after successive onslaughts, Nawab Q\u0101sim Ali Kh\u0101n's army triumphed, and engaging prepare for war, and the latter, without waiting for any declaration of war by the Council, quietly concentrated all the available English regiments in his Factory, and suddenly attacked the Fort at Patna. The Naw\u0101b's garrison who were quite unprepared for such an attack, were surprised, and the Fort fell partially into the hands of the English, whose troops plundered the houses in the Fort. (See Seir, Vol. II, p. 726). From Monghyr, reinforcements were hurried up by the Naw\u0101b, and with these reinforcements Mir Mehdi Kh\u0101n, Naw\u0101b's Deputy Subadar of Patna, vigorously assaulted the Fort, recaptured it, also captured the English Factory, when Mr. Ellison with Dr. Fullerton and other Englishmen and their troops fled to Chapra and thence to the Sarju, when they were taken prisoners by the Bengalee Ram Nidhi, Faujdar of Saran, and Sumroo the Frenchman, and brought to Monghyr, where they were thrown into prison. It was then (See Seir, Vol. II, p. 727), that the Naw\u0101b sent despatches to all his Faujdars and generals, apprising them of the outbreak of hostilities between him and the English, and directing them to put to the sword the English, wherever found. Mr. Amytt was killed at Murshid\u0101b\u0101d, in pursuance of the above order (See Seir, Vol. II, p. 727). The Riyaz's statement that the Naw\u0101b fixed a 'particular day' for the massacre of the English, or that he instructed his officers to kill Englishmen by treachery\u2014does not accord with the Seir's version, which is more authentic and reliable.\n\n1 It is not clear to which battle the Riyaz refers here. As would appear from the note ante, the first battle in which the Naw\u0101b's army triumphed was fought, in order to re-capture the Fort of Patna after the English had suddenly surprised it. It does not appear from the Seir's account that on this victory, the Naw\u0101b slew \"all the Englishmen,\" but what he did was that he apprised his officers of the outbreak of hostilities between him and the English, and directed the former to put the English to the sword wherever found. (See Seir, Vol. II, p. 727). In pursuance of the above general order, Mr. Amytt was put to the sword at Murshid\u0101b\u0101d, and the Qasimbazar factory was looted. (See Seir, Vol. II, pp. 727-728). Then the English Council assembled in Calcutta, and decided on war against the Naw\u0101b, and also proclaimed Mir Jafar (who was in surveillance in Calcutta) as the Naw\u0101b Nazim of Bengal (See Seir, Vol. II, pp. 768-769). In the meantime, the Naw\u0101b had directed his Faujdar of Birbhum (Muhammad Taqi Kh\u0101n) to prepare for fighting with the English, and had sent his officers, Jafar Kh\u0101n, Alam Kh\u0101n and Shaikh Haibatu-l-lah with others to re-inforce Muhammad Taqi Kh\u0101n. The above three officers proceeded to Murshidabad, took ammunitions and armaments from Syed Muhammad Kh\u0101n, who was Deputy Nazim of Murshidabad at the time, and encamped at Plassey and Katwah, whilst Muhammad Taqi Kh\u0101n, with his army, proceeded from Birbhum to Katwah. (See Seir, Vol. II, p. 728).\n\n2 The only real victory that Mir Q\u0101sim appears to have achieved over the English, was in his re-capture of the Fort of Patna. The Riyaz's\nin capturing and killing slew all the English, and plundered their factories. But \u1e62adru-l-\u1e24aqq Kh\u0101n, Faujd\u0101r of Dinajpur, and the R\u0101jah of Bardw\u0101n held back their hands from this wretched work.\n\naccount of these events is neither so detailed nor so lucid as that of the Seiru-l-Mutakkerin, whose author Ghulam Husain Kh\u0101n was an actor in, or actual spectator of, most of these scenes. From the Seir, it appears that after the re-capture of Patna, the next battle between the English and the Naw\u0101b's troops was fought at Katwah. The Naw\u0101b's Faujdar of Birbhum, Muhammad Taqi Kh\u0101n, fought at this battle most gallantly, but his gallantry was of no avail, as Syed Muhammad Kh\u0101n, Deputy Nasim of Murshid\u0101b\u0101d, failed, owing to jealousy that he bore, to support him, and prevented Jafar Kh\u0101n, Alam Kh\u0101n, and Shaikh Haibatu-l-lah also from re-inforcing him. (See Seir, Vol. II, pp. 729 to 731). After this, the English with Mir Jafar entered Murshid\u0101b\u0101d (Seir, Vol. II, p. 731). The news of the fall of his brave officer, Muhammad Taqi Kh\u0101n, disconcerted the Naw\u0101b, who hurried up re-inforcements under Sumroo, Malkar Armenian, and Asadullah, and directed them to concentrate at Suti with the vanquished troops of Katwah. Major Adams commanded the English army. At the battle of Suti, the Naw\u0101b's troops were defeated, and the English won the victory (See Seir, Vol. II, pp. 732-738).\n\nOn hearing of the defeat at Suti, the Naw\u0101b sent his Begams and children to the fort of Rohtas, whilst he himself set out with his general, the Armenian Gurgin Kh\u0101n, to re-inforce his army that was now concentrated on the banks of the Adhwa nalla, a stream taking its rise from the hills north of Rajmahal and flowing to the Ganges. This position was considered to be of strategic importance and impregnable, as it was accessible by only one secret passage. (See Seir, Vol. II, p. 734). On 24th Muharram in 1177 A.H., in the night, the Naw\u0101b marched out from the Monghyr Fort. Suspecting treachery from his officers as well as from his prisoners, and his suspicion being fanned by the Armenian Gurgin Kh\u0101n, the Naw\u0101b before leaving Monghyr killed his prisoners, namely, R\u0101jah R\u0101mn\u0101rain, the quondam Naib Subadar of Behar, R\u0101jah R\u0101jballab, the quondam Diwan of Naw\u0101b Shahamat Jang, Rai Raijan Umed Ram, R\u0101jah Fateh Singh, R\u0101jah Buniad Singh (zamindar of Tikari), Shaikh Abdullah, as well as others. The Naw\u0101b caused R\u0101mn\u0101rain to be thrown into the river below Monghyr fort with a pitcher filled with sand tied to his neck. Gurgin Kh\u0101n, not satisfied with this work of butchery, incited the Naw\u0101b to kill also his English prisoners, consisting of Mr. Elison and Dr. Fullerton and others of the Patna Factory. The Naw\u0101b, however, refused to kill them and placed extra guard on them. Kamgar Kh\u0101n Main also joined the Naw\u0101b, who was encamped at the Chamanagar nalla, but was sent away to Birbhum by the traitor, Gurgin Kh\u0101n. (Seir, Vol. II, p. 735). At this time, Mir Ruju-d-din, son of the late Naw\u0101b Saif Kh\u0101n of Purnia, deserted Mir Q\u0101sim's army, proceeded to Purnia, and made himself its master, and opened correspondence with Mir Jafar Kh\u0101n and the English (Seir, Vol. II, p. 736). At Adhwa, the Naw\u0101b's troops\nWhen Nawab Q\u0101sim Ali Kh\u0101n made his entry into Monghyr, he summoned to his presence all the officers of the Niz\u0101mat of\n\nwere wont for some time to sally out in the night by the secret passage, and to do havoc amongst English troops. Once they went so far as to attack Mir Jafar Kh\u0101n's Camp, Mir Jafar Kh\u0101n having come to Adhna with the English army. Mir Jafar was about to run away, when the English army re-inforced him. The English were thrown into consternation by these destructive night-attacks, and were at a loss to find out the passage by which the Naw\u0101b's troops approached the English entrenchments. At this time, an English soldier who had long ago left the English army and taken service under the Naw\u0101b, informed the English army of the secret passage (Seir, Vol. II, p. 787), and undertook to guide them to the Naw\u0101b's entrenchments at Adhna. With the help of this man, Colonel Goddard, with an English regiment, moved to the Naw\u0101b's entrenchment in the night. The Naw\u0101b's army were in a false sense of security, fancying the position impregnable, and thinking that the secret passage to it was unknown to the English.\n\nThe Naw\u0101b's army under Asadullah Kh\u0101n, the Frenchman Sumroo, the Armenians, Malkar and Antony, were surprised by this night-attack of the English and defeated (Seir, Vol. II, p. 738), and dispersed on 26th Safar, 1177 A.H. On the second or third day, the news of this disaster reached the Naw\u0101b, who now moved to the Monghyr Fort. After halting there two or three days, he left that place with Gurgin Kh\u0101n and others, placing the Fort in charge of one Arab Ali Kh\u0101n, a protege and creature of Gurgin Kh\u0101n, and reached the Rohua nalla. At this time, a leading nobleman named Ali Ibrahim Kh\u0101n counselled the Naw\u0101b to release the English prisoners, named Messrs. Elison, Jee, and Lushington and others, or at least to send their wives by boat to Major Adams. The Naw\u0101b referred Ali Ibrahim Kh\u0101n to Gurgin Kh\u0101n, the Armenian evil genius of the Naw\u0101b. The Armenian said no boats were available, and refused to listen to the humane counsel of Ali Ibrahim Kh\u0101n. On the way, Gurgin Kh\u0101n was hacked to pieces with the sword by some horseman, whose pay was in arrear. The Naw\u0101b moved from Rohua nalla to Barh, where Jagat Set and his brother Sarupchand were put to the sword under Naw\u0101b's orders. From there the Naw\u0101b moved to Patna, where he received news that Arab Ali Kh\u0101n, commandant of the Monghyr Fort, and a creature of Gurgin Kh\u0101n, had accepted a bribe from the English, and treacherously made over the Fort to the latter. (Seir, Vol. II, p. 741). The Naw\u0101b was exasperated; he was filled with suspicion, and his annoyance knew no bounds. He ordered the Frenchman, Sumroo, to kill the English prisoners. This Sumroo, though of one religion with the English prisoners, willingly accepted this murderous errand, and on the night of the last day of Rabi-al-Awal, 1177 A.H., he shot down the English prisoners, who were lodged at the time in the house of the late H\u0101ji Ahmad, brother of Mahabat Jang. That house has since become the English burial-ground in Patna, (See Seir, Vol. II, p. 739). None escaped except Dr. Fullerton (Seir, Vol. II, p. 740). The Naw\u0101b accused Dr. Fullerton of treachery, which the latter\nBengal, and set himself to the work of administering the several disavowed. The Naw\u00e2b then spared his life. Dr. Fullerton subsequently escaped to Hajipur and joined the English army there (Seir, Vol. II, p. 741). The English next invaded Patna, and stormed the fort there (Seir, Vol. II, p. 742). The Naw\u00e2b now crossed the Karamnassa river, and entered the territory of Naw\u00e2b-Vizier Shujan-d-daulah. (Seir, p. 743). The Naw\u00e2b (Mir Q\u00e2sim) now met the Naw\u00e2b-Vizier Shujan-d-daulah and the Emperor near Allahabad, and induced them to help him in driving out the English from the Subahs of Behar and Bengal (Seir, Vol. II, p. 745). The Emperor, the Naw\u00e2b-Vizier and the Naw\u00e2b now marched to Benares where they encamped for some time, in order to invade Behar (p. 746 Seir). Dreading the approach of the Naw\u00e2b-Vizier Shujan-d-daulah, the English with Mir Jafar, who had gone in pursuit of Mir Q\u00e2sim, now retired from Baksar towards Patna. Shujan-d-daulah with his huge army and with Mir Q\u00e2sim now overtook the English near Phulwari (p. 749, Seir, Vol. II). There were skirmishes, followed by a battle in which the English army reeled, but the result was indecisive, owing to absence of concerted action between Mir Q\u00e2sim and Shujan-d-daulah (pp. 749-750, Seir, Vol. II). At the same time, Mir Mehdi Kh\u00e2n, who had before fought so bravely for Mir Q\u00e2sim and re-captured the Patna Fort from the English, now deserted his old master, Mir Q\u00e2sim, and joined the English (p. 750, Seir, Vol. II).\n\nThe Naw\u00e2b-Vizier with Mir Q\u00e2sim now retired to Baksar (Seir pp. 751). At this time, from the English side, Dr. Fullerton used Ghulam Hussain Kh\u00e2n, the author of the Seir, as a spy, and wrote to him to induce the Emperor to give his support to the English, and to withhold his support of the Naw\u00e2b-Vizier (p. 751, Seir, Vol. II). Ghulam Hussain Kh\u00e2n and his father Haidat Ali Kh\u00e2n, who held jagirs at Husainabad in Monghyr district, held a peculiar position at the time. They professed friendship both for Dr. Fullerton and the English, and also for Mir Q\u00e2sim and the Naw\u00e2b-Vizier. They were all things to all men, and enjoyed friendship and influence amongst both the hostile parties. They opened secret correspondence with the Emperor, and induced the latter to give his moral support to the English (p. 751, Seir, Vol. II). A conference was now held between Ghulam Hussain Kh\u00e2n who now played the role of an English spy and between Major Carnac, Dr. Fullerton and Mir Jafar, and a reply was sent through Ghulam Hussain Kh\u00e2n and other spies to the Emperor. In the meantime, Shujan-d-daulah fell out with Mir Q\u00e2sim (p. 752). Mir Q\u00e2sim now assumed the garb of a faq\u00eer, but was shortly after induced to give it up, at the entreaties of Shujan-d-daulah who found his honour was at stake. Shortly after, Mir Q\u00e2sim's French officer, Sumroo, the infamous perpetrator of the Patna massacre, mutinied against Mir Q\u00e2sim, and was paid up and discharged by the latter. Then this infamous Frenchman took service under Shujan-d-daulah with all the guns and ammunition of his old master, Mir Q\u00e2sim (p. 755, Vol. II, Seir). The Naw\u00e2b-Vizier shamelessly imprisoned his refugee Mir Q\u00e2sim; all people deserted the latter, except his one old brave and loyal officer, Ali Ibrahim Kh\u00e2n, who clung to his old master with a fidelity uncommon in those treacherous days. When Shujan-\nProvinces. And summoning to Monghyr, one by one, the R\u0101i d-danlah spoke ill of Mir Q\u0101sim, and wondered why Ali Ibrahim Kh\u0101n clung to Mir Q\u0101sim, in spite of the latter speaking ill of Ali Ibrahim, the latter returned a manly and dignified answer which brought tears even to the eyes of the mean Naw\u0101b-Vizier. Ali Ibrahim said: 'To my knowledge, I have not been guilty of any dereliction in duty to my master (Mir Q\u0101sim), except that after the events at Patna, whilst his other officers connelled him to go to the Dakhin, and secure support of the Mahrattas, I alone insisted on Mir Q\u0101sim to seek shelter with you, the Naw\u0101b-Vizier, and with the Emperor!' (p. 757, Vol. II, Seir.) At this time, Major Munro, commander of the English army in Patna, wrote through Dr. Fullerton to Ghulam Husain Kh\u0101n, the author of the Seir, to use his influence in acquiring the Fort of Rohtas for the English. Ghulam Husain Kh\u0101n tampered with Mir Q\u0101sim's commandant R\u0101jah Sahmel, and induced the latter to make over the Fort of Rohtas to Captain Goddard of the English army (p. 758, Seir, Vol. II). Mir Jafar now returned to Murghid\u0101b\u0101d, where he died (Seir, Vol. II, pp. 758-759), on 14th Shaban, 1178. Mir Jafar before setting out for Calcutta had left his brother, Mir Mu\u1e25ammad Kasim Kh\u0101n, as Deputy Nazim of Patna, with Dhiraq Narain (B\u0101mnar\u0101in's brother) as Diwan under the latter. Mir Jafar appointed Nando Kumar as his Diwan (p. 759, Seir, Vol. II), and imprisoned Mu\u1e25ammad Riza Kh\u0101n, Deputy Nazim of Dacca (Jahangirnagar), who was son-in-law of Rabia Begam and Ataullah Kh\u0101n Sabat Jang. From fear of the prestige and power of Shuj\u0101n-d-danlah and from fear of the odium they would incur by engaging in a war with the Emperor, both Mir Jafar and the English seriously contemplated patching up a peace with the Naw\u0101b-Vizier and the Emperor, leaving to them the Behar Provinces, and stipulating to pay them a fixed revenue for Bengal (p. 760, Vol. II, Seir). This was, however, not to be, owing to the Naw\u0101b-Vizier's ambition which would accept of no compromise, but aimed at an exclusive domination over the whole Empire. Whilst Mir Jafar was yet alive in Calcutta, Major Munro succeeded Major Carnac in the command of the English army, and was ordered in Safar 1178 A.H., to proceed to Baksar to fight with the Naw\u0101b-Vizier Shuj\u0101n-d-danlah, who was offensive in his correspondence with the English Council in Calcutta.\n\nThe Naw\u0101b-Vizier and his army were in a sense of false security and were immersed in pleasures, frivolities and amusements, as if they had come for a picnic. On Major Munro's arrival, the Naw\u0101b-Vizier with his army hurriedly took up a position on the north-west of a jhil or marshy sheet of water. The English army rested on the south-east of the jhil. The Naw\u0101b-Vizier posted Sumroo and Madak with eight guns and eight regiments of Mir Q\u0101sim to cover his front. The Naw\u0101b-Vizier's army was composed of three wings. The right wing was commanded by the Naw\u0101b-Vizier himself, his centre was commanded by Shuja Quli Kh\u0101n with six thousand Mughal troops, and his left wing was under the command of B\u0101jah Beni Bahadur, Naw\u0101b-Vizier's Deputy Subadar in Oudh and Allahabad. The left flank of the left wing rested on the banks of the Ganges. The battle opened with a cannonade, which was briskly kept up on both sides, and which did its destructive work\nR\u0101\u012b\u0101n Umid R\u0101\u012b, his son, K\u0101l\u012b Parsh\u0101d, R\u0101mkishor, R\u0101jballab, on both sides. Then the Naw\u0101b-Vizier with his Mughal and Duranian troops made a flanking sally from towards the right of his own artillery, assaulted Major Munro's cavalry and camp, and worked havoc in the English army. From the brisk cannonade kept up by Madak and Samroo, and from the repeated assaults of the Naw\u0101b-Vizier, the English army was hard-pressed. Major Munro grasping the crisis and finding a frontal attack impossible, owing to the muddy jhil lying in front of him, quickly detached a corps under Captain Nan to make a flanking movement from the side of the river, in order to attack the Naw\u0101b-Vizier's left wing, commanded by R\u0101jah Beni Bahadur. This corps approached slowly, and reached the plain of the ruins amidst which R\u0101jah Beni Bahadur's troops lay. Shaikh Ghulam Qadir and other Shaikh Zadas of Lucknow who formed the van of R\u0101jah Beni Bahadur's army, stood with guns behind a wall amidst those ruins. The English regiments slowly and circumspectly, without disclosing themselves, crept up to the summit of the wall, and it was only when they rolled down stones on the heads of the R\u0101jah's troops that rested behind the wall at its foot, that these woke up from their slumber. It was only then that Shaikh Ghulam Qadir and his kinsmen and followers came to know of the arrival of the English regiment, and rose up to fight. Before, however, these Shaikhs could arrange their force in fighting array, the English regiment commenced firing their muskets, and killed Ghulam Qadir and his kinsmen, whilst others fled. At this time, R\u0101jah Beni Bahadur asked Ghalib Kh\u0101n, a notable of Delhi, what course he was to follow. Ghalib Kh\u0101n answered that if the R\u0101jah cared for his honour, he must die fighting, or else must run away. Then for a time the R\u0101jah engaged in fighting, but shortly after changing his mind, and preferring not to die, ran away. In the meantime, hearing the booming of cannons by the English regiment on the heads of Shaikh Ghulam Qadir and R\u0101jah Beni Bahadur, Shuja Quli Kh\u0101n's jealousy was aroused, and fancying that the booming proceeded from the R\u0101jah's army, and that the R\u0101jah would soon achieve the honour of a victory, without stopping to enquire into the matter, he forthwith sallied out of his position, advanced across Sumroo and Madak, who in consequence had to suspend their cannonade, and waded across the jhil full of mud. The English artillery from front now quickened their cannonade, and Shuja Quli Kh\u0101n and his soldiers uselessly sacrificed their lives, having lost the cover of their own artillery. The British regiment now penetrated through the entrenchments of R\u0101jah Beni Bahadur who had fled, and attacked the wing of the Naw\u0101b-Vizier, as the ground between was already cleared by the foolish and disastrous forward movement of Shuja Quli Kh\u0101n. Then the Naw\u0101b-Vizier's army reeled and broke, the Naw\u0101b-Vizier himself stood the ground for some time, but seeing himself deserted by his troops, retreated to Allahabad, whilst his Mughal and Duranian troops as well as English troops, commenced plundering his tents. Mir Q\u0101sim who was a prisoner in the hands of the Naw\u0101b-Vizier had been released one day before this battle, and after the battle fled to Benares. (See Seir, Vol. II, pp. 761-763).\nJagat Set Mahtab Rai, Rajah Sarup Chand (Jagat Set's brother), the Zamindars of Dinajpur, Nadiah, Khirahpur, Birbhum, and Rajshahi, &c., and Dulal Rai, Diwan of Bhujpur, Fatih Singh, the Rajah of Tikari, son of Rajah Sundar, and Ramnarain, Deputy Governor of the Subah of Azimabad, Muhammad Masum, and Munshi Jagat Rai and others, the Nawab threw them into prison. And after strengthening the Fort of Monghyr, the Nawab sent a large army to Bengal. In the vicinity of Rajmahal, on the banks of the river Adhunah, he reviewed his army, and sent despatches to the Faujdaras and the Deputy Nazim of Bengal, directing and instructing them peremptorily to fight with the English. Amongst them, Shaikh Hidayitu-l-lah, Deputy Faujdar of Nadiah, with a large army, Jafar Khan, and Alam Khan, Commandant of the Turkish bodyguard of the Nawab, swiftly advanced to Katwah, to fight. From the other side, the English army proclaiming Nawab Jafar Ali Khan as Subadar of Bengal, and taking him in their company advanced to fight, and at a distance of two karoh entrenched itself at Dainhat. On the 3rd of the month of Muharram, both the armies arraying themselves for battle kindled the fire of warfare. The army of Qasim Ali Khan, after the fall of a number of men whose moment for death had arrived, being defeated, fled to Palasi (Plassey) to Muhammad Taqi Khan, Faujdar of Birbhum. After two or three days, when the army of Bengal had collected together, the English Generals arrived pursuing them.\n\nThis decisive victory at Baksar in 1764 (more than the battle of Plassey) gave the English a firm foothold in Bengal, as a Ruling Power. It was soon followed by the Emperor Shah Alam's grant of the Divani of Bengal, Behar, and Orissa to the English in 1765. (See Seir, Vol. II, p. 773).\n\nThe English stipulated to pay annually twenty-four lakhs to the Emperor on account of the Revenue of the above three Subahs.\n\nIn this note, I have thought fit to summarise the events as narrated in the Seiru-l-Mutakkerin, a contemporary record, the author whereof was either an actor in, or a spectator of, the many scenes enacted in those times. The note is long, but I have thought fit to give it, in order to follow the development of the many important and stirring events that at length culminated in the transfer of the Ruling Power in Bengal from Moslem into English hands.\n\n1 Probably a misreading or misprint in the printed Persian text for Kharakpur.\n\n2 In the Seir, his name is mentioned as Shaikh Haibatu-l-lah. (See Seir, Vol. II, p. 728, and n. ante).\n\n3 This must be the name of a market-place in Katwah itself.\nMuhammad Taqi Khan, with a large army, advanced to fight, but fell on being wounded with a gun-shot. His army being defeated, retired to Murshidabad. Syed Muhammad Khan, who held the office of Deputy Nazim of Bengal after the departure of Mir Turab Ali Khan for Monghyr, came out of the City of Murshidabad with the troops at hand, and entrenched himself at Chuna Khali. But when the news of the approach of the English army arrived, his troops (many of whom had already received wounds in their fightings with the English) without engaging in battle and without firing their guns and muskets abandoned their entrenchments, and fled to Suti. The army of Qasim Ali Khan arrived at Suti, where Sumroo the Frenchman, with other Generals and troops, was already from before. But the English not abandoning their pursuit followed them up, and a great battle ensued at Suti. In that the star of Nawab Qasim Ali Khan's luck was waning, and the fortune of the English was in the ascendant, after severe fighting, in this battle also the English triumphed. The army of Nawab Qasim Ali Khan, unable to stand the cannonade of the English artillery, were defeated, and retired to the banks of the Adhuhah nalla, which was their camping ground from before. There all the troops of the Nawab collected together, and renewed fighting. At length, many of the Generals of Nawab Qasim Ali Khan's army, including Gurgin Khan, Commander of the Nawab's Artillery corps, as well as others, conspired with the English. The English, thus freed from anxiety, made a night-attack, and broke the Nawab's army, which fled. A severe defeat was thus sustained by the Nawab. The defeated army in a worsted condition retreated to Monghyr. Nawab Qasim Ali Khan, on receiving news of this defeat, lost heart, and was thrown into consternation. In view of the disloyalty and treachery of the traitors who had eaten his salt, the Nawab felt himself unequal for a contest, and abandoning all ideas of warfare he set out in an anxious mood for Azimabad. The Nawab now killed Gurgin Khan on account of his treachery, and also slew Jagat Set and his brother, who were the plotters of this treacherous conspiracy, and who had sent out secret messages inviting Jafar Ali Khan and the Christian English, and whose treasonable correspondence had been intercepted. The Nawab also killed other Zamindars, &c., who from before were in prison, and each of whom was unrivalled in his day for hatching plots and intrigues. After arrival at\nAzimabad; there, too, not finding himself secure, the Nawab sent his Begams to the Fort of Rohtas, whilst he himself proceeded to the Subah of Oudh to the Vazirul-Mulk Nawab Shujau-d-daulah Bahadur. There also he fell out with the Nawab-Vizier, who confiscated much of his treasures. From thence departing, the Nawab retired to the hills, and in those tracts he lingered some years in various mishaps, and at length died.\u00b9\n\n---\n\nNIZAMAT FOR THE SECOND TIME OF JAFAR ALI KHAN BAHADUR.\n\nAfter Qasim Ali Khan's defeat, the English Chiefs again placed Nawab Jafar Ali Khan on the masnad of the Nizamat of Bengal. Ten annas of the revenue of the Provinces were allotted to the English for their service as Diwan, whilst six annas of the same were held by Nawab Jafar Ali Khan. This time also for a period of three years, after displaying great feebleness in his Nizamat, in the year 1178 A.H., Nawab Jafar Ali Khan died. The English Chiefs placed on the masnad of Nizamat his son, Najmu-d-daulah,\u00b2 and appointed Nawab Muhammad Riza Khan Bahadur Muzaffar Jang to the office of Naib Nazim (Deputy Nazim). Najmu-d-daulah, after sitting on the masnad of Nizamat for two years, passed to the regions of eternity. After Najmu-d-daulah's death, his younger brother, Saifuddin-d-daulah\u00b3 succeeded to the masnad of Nizamat, whilst Nawab Muzaffar Jang continued to hold the office of Naib Nazim. Saifuddin-d-daulah after holding the Nizamat for two years died of small-pox; and another brother of his, Mubarakuddin-d-daulah, succeeded to the masnad of Nizamat. The English Chiefs removing Nawab Muhammad Riza Khan Muzaffar Jang from the office of Deputy Nazim, have fixed sixteen laks\u2074 of rupees as an annual allowance for the Nazim. This amount the English pay each year. The English have now acquired domination over the\n\n\u00b9 For some time, Mir Qasim stayed in the Rohilla country, subsequently left Utterghanaidi (the Afghan tract) and proceeded to the country of the Rana Gahad; thence he proceeded to Rajputana, whence again he moved to the tract between Agra and Delhi, where he died in distress.

And up to the date of the completion of this History, namely 1202\u00b2 A.H., corresponding to the thirty-first year of the reign of Emperor Sh\u0101h \u0100lam, the sway and authority of the English prevail over all the three Subahs of Bengal, Behar, and Orissa.\n\n\u00b9 The English divided the country into six Zillahs, viz.: (1) Zillah Calcutta; (2) Zillah Bardwan; (3) Zillah Rajshahye-Murshidabad; (4) Zillah Jahangirnagar (or Dacca); (5) Zillah Dinajpur; (6) Zillah Azimabad (or Patna); and appointed English Zillahdars to each Zillah with a Council.

When the planet of the Muslim faith rose, and the bright effulgence of the Muslim sun shone on the East and the West, gradually, the countries of Hindust\u0101n and the Dakhin were recipient of the rays of the moon of the Muhammadan faith, and Muslims commenced visiting those countries. Many of the kings and rulers of those parts embraced the Islamic religion, whilst the R\u0101jahs of the ports of Goa, D\u0101bil, and Jab\u016bl, &c., like Muhammadan rulers, gave Musalman emigrants from Arabia quarters on the sea-shores, and treated them with honour and respect.\u00b9 In consequence, the Jews and the\n\n\u00b9 See Hunter's History of British India, Vol. I, p. 29. Writes Dr. Hunter: \"The Saracen Arabs who under the conquering impulse of Isl\u0101m next seized the countries of the Indo-Syrian route (632-651 A.D.) soon realised its value. They were a trading not less than a fighting race, and Bussorah and Baghdad under the Caliphs became the opulent headquarters of the Indian trade.\" The Saracens conquered Egypt, Syria, and Persia, 632-651 A.D. In a footnote to p. 28 of the above History, Dr. Hunter refers the reader for\nChristians burnt in the fire of envy and malice. And when the Kingdoms of the Dakhin and Gujrat became subject to the Musalm\u0101n Emperors of Dehli,1 and Isl\u0101m became powerful in the kingdom of the Dakhin, the Jews and the Christians placed the seal of silence on the door of their tongues, and ceased to utter words of enmity and hatred. Subsequently in the year 900 A.H., weakness2 and decay set in in the kingdom of the Dakhin. At that time, the Portuguese Christians, on behalf of the king of their own country, were directed to build forts on the sea-shores of India.\n\nan account of the Jewish trade with the East to an article on 'The Jews under Rome' by Lieut.-Col. Conder. Again says Dr. Hunter (p. 45): \"The trading colony of Arabs at Canton included at the beginning of the 7th century A.D., an uncle of Muhammad the Prophet.\" Again in p. 46, says Dr. Hunter: \"It was a commercial dispute that brought about the first Musalm\u0101n conquest of an Indian Province. In 711 A.D., Kasim led a naval expedition against Sindh, to claim damages for the ill-treatment of Arab merchantmen and pilgrims near the mouth of the Indus in their voyage from Ceylon. During the following centuries the Indian Ocean became an outlying domain of Isl\u0101m. The Arab geographers mapped the course from the Persian Gulf to China into 'seven seas,' each having a name of its own, and with the Arab-Chinese harbour of Gampua on their eastern limit. Abul Feda, the princely geographer of the fourteenth century (1273-1331) mentions Malacca as the most important trading place between Arabia and China, the common resort of Moslems, Persians, Hindus, and the Chinese. Colonies of Arabs and Jews settled in an early century of our era on the southern Bombay coast, where their descendants form distinct communities at the present day. The voyages of Sinbad the Sailor are a popular romance of the Indian trade under the Caliphs of Baghdad, probably in the ninth century A.D.\"\n\nFrom the above it is clear that India, including Bengal, was within the sphere of the commercial influence of the Saracen Arabs, from about the very dawn of Isl\u0101m.\n\n1 The first Musalm\u0101n conquests in the Dakhin were made in the reign of Jallalu-d-din Khilji, Emperor of Delhi, through the military genius of his nephew, Alau-d-din Khilji. See Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi, p. 170, and n. 2, ante, p. 90.\n\n2 \"In 1564, Vijayanagar finally went down before the Moslems in the field of Talikot after an existence of 4\u00bd centuries. The Bahmani dynasty formed from the coalition of the Musalm\u0101n adventurers in the fourteenth century, began to break up in 1489, and by 1525, its disintegration was complete. The Portuguese arrived just as this once powerful kingdom was evolving itself through internecine war into the Five Musalm\u0101n states of Southern India. At the time (1498, when Vasco da Gama landed in India) the Afghan sovereignty in Northern India was dwindling to a vanishing point.\" See Dr. Hunter's History of British India, Vol. I, pp. 101-102,\nIn the year 904 A.H., four ships of the Portuguese Christians came to the ports of Qandrinah and K\u0101likot, and the Portuguese after ascertaining thoroughly the state of affairs of the sea-board sailed back. And the next year, six Portuguese ships arrived at K\u0101likot, and the Portuguese disembarked, and made a prayer to the ruler of that place, who was called Samri, to prevent the Musalmans from trading with Arabia, urging that they (the Portuguese) would yield him more profit than the Musalmans. The Samri did not listen to their prayer. But the Christians commenced molesting the Musalmans in mercantile business, so that the Samri becoming enraged ordered the former's slaughter and massacre. Seventy leading Christians were slain; whilst the rest getting into sloops sailed out to save themselves, and alighted near the town of Kuchin, the ruler whereof was on terms of hostility with the\n\n1 Covilham, the first Portuguese explorer in India, stayed some time on the Malabar coast (having come there from Aden on an Arab ship), in 1487. Vasco da Gama reached Calicut on May 20th, 1498. See Dr. Hunter's History, Vol. I, pp. 87-88.\n\n2 The European form of Qandrinah is, I guess, Conlon or Calicoulan. For Conlon, Calicoulan, Cochin, Calicut, see the map at p. 96, of the above History. Ibn-i-Batutah (1304-1377) mentions Quilon and Calicut amongst the five chief ports that he had seen. See p. 48, n. 2 of the above History.\n\n3 Dr. Hunter states that at the time the Malabar chiefs were tolerant of the religions of the many nations who traded at their ports. Abu Zaid when mentioning the foreign colonies records that the king allows each sect to follow its own religion (Abu Zaidu-l-Hasan of Siraf translated in Sir Henry Elliot's History of India). Manichaeans, Musalmans, Jews, and Christians were alike welcome at the Malabar ports. Not only Jews from the earlier times (from 6th century B.C.) and 'St. Thomas Christians,' from 68 A.D., but also Arab traders (Moplahs) both in pre-Islamic and Islamic times were settled on the Malabar coasts. (See Dr. Hunter's History, Vol. I, pp. 98-100).\n\n4 The Zamorin of Calicut received the Portuguese graciously. But the foreign Arab merchants, then the most powerful community at his port, perceived that the new ocean-route must imperil their ancient monopoly by way of the Red Sea. They accordingly instigated the court officials to intrigues which nearly ended in a treacherous massacre, p. 103, Hunter's History, Vol. I. The Riyaz's account would however show that the provocation came from the side of the Portuguese, who came with a crusading spirit. (See p. 101, ibid).\n\n5 In English histories, he is called the 'Zamorin,' which is the European form of the Tamil Samuri, meaning 'son of the Sea.' See Hunter's History of British India, Vol. I, p. 95, n. 1.\n\n6 Or Cochin. From Hunter's History, Vol. I, p. 103, it would appear Da Gama departed from Calicut, and for some time stopped at Cannanore.\nSamri. There they obtained permission to build a fort, and within a short time they erected quickly a small fort, and dismantling a mosque which stood on the sea-shore they built on its site a church. And this was the first fort which the Christians erected in India. In the meanwhile, the inhabitants of the port of Kanor also leagued with them. The Christians erected a fort also there. Being freed from anxiety, the Christians commenced a trade in pepper and ginger, and obstructed others from trading therein. Consequently, the Samri advancing with his forces slew the son of the king of Kuchin, and ravaging that province returned. The successors of the slain ruler collecting again a force raised the standard of sovereignty, re-populated the province, and under the advice of the Ferengis placed a flotilla of galleys in the sea. And the ruler of Kanor also similarly fitted out a flotilla of boats. The Samri, getting enraged at this, bestowing all his treasures on the army, twice or thrice advanced with his forces against Kuchin. At every time, the Portuguese helped Kuchin.\n\n1 In 1500 King Emmanuel of Portugal sent a fleet of thirteen ships under Pedro Alvarez Caleral, who was well received by the Zamorin, and established a factory on shore at Calicut for purchase of spices. He captured an Arab vessel and a Moslem vessel. The Arab merchants were roused to indignation, and sacked the Portuguese factory at Calicut, slaying the chief agent and fifty-three of his men. Caleral retaliated by burning ten Arab ships, and sailed down to Cochin, burning two more Calicut vessels on his way. Caleral concluded a friendly treaty with the R\u0101jah of Cochin, promising to make him some day Zamorin of Calicut, and established a factory at Cochin. Friendly overtures were also received by him from the R\u0101jah of Quilon and Cannanor. See Hunter's History, Vol. I, p. 107. The fanatical vandalism of the Portuguese Christians in demolishing a Moslem Mosque, is in sad contrast to the toleration and scrupulous regard for the sanctity of the Christian Church shewn by the early Moslem Arabs under Omar, after the latter had conquered Palestine and visited Jerusalem.\u2014See Sir William Muir's 'Annals of the Early Caliphate,' p. 210.\n\n2 Animated by a crusading spirit the aim of the Portuguese Government was to destroy the Arab commerce, and to establish an armed monopoly. See Hunter's History, Vol. I, p. 108.\n\n3 I.e., the Portuguese Christians. For the origin and significance of the term Ferengis, see Dr. Hunter's History of British India, Vol. I, p. 184. Says Dr. Hunter: \"The ravenous hordes thus let loose in India, made the race-name of Christian (Ferengi) a word of terror until the strong rule of the Mughal Empire turned it into one of contempt.\" See also n. 2, ibid.\n\n4 In 1502 Vasco da Gama as Portuguese Admiral of the Indian Seas came to India for the second time, with a fleet of twenty vessels. He bombarded Calicut\nso that the Samri did not succeed in subduing it, and without attaining his object retired. Becoming powerless, he sent envoys to the rulers of Egypt, Jiddah, the Dakhin and Gujrat. Complaining of the malpractices of the Christians, he asked for help, and sending out narratives of the oppressions practised by the Christians over the Musalmans, he stirred up the veins of their zeal and rage. At length, Sultan Qab\u015fur Ghuril despatched to the\n\nand destroyed its Arab merchant-fleet. At Cochin, Cannanore, Quilon, and Baticals, he established factories. Da Gama's successes were stained by revolting cruelties never to be forgotten. For a gruesome detail of those barbarous cruelties, see Hunter's History, Vol. I, pp. 109, 139, 140 and 141. Da Gama now (1503) returned to Lisbon. The Zamorin and the Arab merchants burned to avenge the tortures and outrages inflicted by this Christian fanatic. They attacked the Cochin Raja, seized his capital, and demanded surrender of the Portuguese factors left under his protection. The Cochin chief bravely held out until relieved by arrival of the next Portuguese fleet in September, 1503. Hunter's History, Vol. I, p. 110. This fleet operated against India under Alfonso de Albuquerque and his cousin Francisco de Albuquerque. In India, the two Albuquerque built a fort at Cochin, established a factory at Quilon, and severely punished the Zamorin. Alfonso returned to Lisbon in 1504, whilst his cousin was lost on his way home together with his squadron. See Hunter's History, Vol. I, p. 111.\n\nThe next expedition was sent in 1504 under Lopo Soares de Albergaria. He continued the policy of unsparing destruction against the ports in which Arab influence prevailed; laid part of Calicut in ruins, and burned Cranganor. Soares broke the Arab supremacy on the Malabar coast. In 1505, King Emmanuel of Portugal sent Don Francisco da Almeida as the Portuguese Viceroy in India. His principal duty was to coerce the Malabar sea-coast chiefs who might be friendly to the Arab merchants, to strengthen the Portuguese factorites on shore, and thirdly, to break the Moslem Naval supremacy, including the armed Arab merchantmen of Calicut and the regular Navy of the Mameluke Sultan of Egypt, who menaced the existence of Portugal in the East. This was the third and last act in the long conflict between Medi\u00e6val Christendom and Islam. In four years (1505-1509), Almeida overthrew the power of the Moslem Arabs at the Malabar ports, defeated the Zamorin and destroyed his fleet of 84 ships and 120 galleys, and slew 3,000 Musalmans. See Hunter's History, Vol. I, p. 116.\n\n\"The Mameluke Sultan of Egypt sent forth in 1508 a great expedition under Admiral Amir Hussain, who effected a coalition with the Moslem fleet of the northern Bombay coast, and was aiming to effect also a junction with the southern Calicut squadron. Lourenco Almeida, son of the Portuguese Viceroy, attempted to oppose this junction, but was shot down. The Moslem victors chivalrously gave him honourable burial, and respectfully congratulated Almeida on a son who at the age of twenty-two had covered himself with\nIndian coasts a General, named Amir \u1e24usain, with a fleet of thirteen war-vessels, containing a naval force with armaments. Sultan Mahm\u016bd of Gujr\u0101t and Sultan Mahm\u016bd Bahmani of the Dakhin also fitted out numerous ships from the ports of Deo, S\u016brat, Kolah, Dabil and Jab\u016bl, in order to fight with the Portuguese. First, the ships from Egypt arrived in the port of Deo, and uniting with the ships of Gujr\u0101t set out for Jab\u016bl, which was the rendezvous of the Portuguese. And some ships of the Samri and some ships of Goa and Dabil having also joined them, they kindled the fire of war; but suddenly, one warship full of the Portuguese quietly sailed up from the rear. The Portuguese commenced a cannonade, and converted the sea into a zone of fire. Malik Ay\u0101z, ruler of Deo, and Amir \u1e24usain were obliged to fight with them, but failed to effect anything. Some Egyptian galleys were captured, and the Musalm\u0101ns drank the potion of martyrdom, whilst the Portuguese triumphantly steered back to their own ports. Inasmuch as at that period, Sultan Salim, Khagan\u00b9 of R\u016bm (Turkey), defeated the Ghoriah Sultan\u00b2 of Egypt, and the empire of the latter came to an end, the Samri who was the promoter of this war lost heart, and the Portuguese acquired complete domination. In the month of Ramzan, 915 A.H., the Portuguese proceeded to K\u0101likot, set fire to the Cathedral Mosque, and swept the town with the broom of plunder. But on the following day, the Malabarese collecting together attacked imperishable glory. In 1509, Almeida, the senior, defeated the combined Moslem fleets off Diu, and slew 3,000 of their men. The aggressions of the Turks upon Egypt gave the Mameluke Sultan, of Cairo, work nearer home, and disabled him from sending further expeditions to India.\n\n[The Turks wrested Egypt from the Mameluke Sultan in 1517].\n\nAlmeida's victory over Moslems off Diu on February 2nd, 1509, secured to Christendom the Naval supremacy in Asia, and turned the Indian Ocean for the next century into a Portuguese sea.\u201d See Hunter's History of British India, Vol. I, pp. 117-118.\n\n\u201cThe first five years of annual expeditions from 1500 to 1505 had given the Portuguese the upper hand in the armed commerce of the Malabar coast. The following four years under Almeida (1505-1509) left them masters of the Indian Ocean. The next six years (1509-1515) were under Alfonso de Albuquerque to see them grow into a territorial power on the Indian continent.\u201d\n\nSee ibid., p. 119.\n\n\u00b9 In the printed Persian text, Khankan is obviously a misprint or misreading for Khagan, which is a title held by Sultans of Turkey.\n\n\u00b2 I.e., the Mameluke Sultans of Egypt.\nthe Christians, killed five hundred leading Portuguese, and drowned many of them in the sea. Those who escaped the sword fled to the port of Kolam,\u00b9 and intriguing with the Chief of that place, at a distance of half a farsakh from that town, erected a small fort, and entrenched themselves there. And in the same year, they wrested the fort of Goah from the possession of Yusaf Adil Sh\u0101h;\u00b2 but the latter shortly after amicably got it back from their hands. But after a short period, the Portuguese offering a large sum of money to the ruler of that place re-acquired possession of it, and establishing their Capital at that port, which was very strong, fortified it further. And the Samri, from the humiliation and sorrow consequent on this, died in the year 921 A.H., and his brother succeeding him ceased hostility, and establishing peaceful relations with the Portuguese, gave the latter permission to erect a fort near the town of K\u0101likot, obtaining from them a stipulation to the effect that he would send yearly four ships of pepper and ginger to the ports of Arabia. For a short while, the Portuguese kept their promise and word, but when the fort was completed, they prevented his trading in the aforesaid articles, and commenced various malpractices and oppressions on the Musalm\u0101ns. And similarly, the Jews who were at Kadatklor,\u00b3 being informed of the weakness of the Samri, transgressed the limits of propriety, and caused many Musalm\u0101ns to drink the syrup of martyrdom. The Samri, repenting of his past policy, first proceeded to Kadatklor, and completely extinguished\n\n\u00b9 Perhaps 'Coulan.'\n\u00b2 Albuquerque (1509-1515) succeeded Almeida as the Portuguese Viceroy in India.\n\u00b3 Yusaf Adil Sh\u0101h was king of Bijapur, which was one of the five Musalman States formed in Southern India out of the old Bahmani kingdom.\n\nThe fort of Goa was seized by the Portuguese in 1510.\n\n\"The pirate chief Timojn proposed to Albuquerque that as the lord of Goa was dead (in reality absent) they should seize the place. This they easily did in March, 1510. But the rightful sovereign, a son of the Ottoman Sultan Amurad II, whose romantic adventures had ended with his carving for himself the kingdom of Bijapur in southern India, hurried back to Goa, and drove out the Portuguese in May. The king being again called away by disturbances in the interior, the Portuguese recaptured Goa with the help of the pirate Timojn in November, 1510. Its rightful sovereign, Yusaf Adil Sh\u0101h the king of Bijapur, died in the following month (December.) His son was a minor.\"\n\nSee Hunter's History, Vol. I, pp. 152-153.\n\n\u2074 That is, 'Oranganor.' (See map in Hunter's History, Vol. I, p. 96).]\nthe Jews, so that no trace of them remained there. After this, with the support of all the Musalmans of Malabar, he advanced to K\u0101likot, besieged the fort of the Portuguese, and fighting bravely defeated the latter, and stormed their fort. In consequence, the power and prestige of the Malabarese Musalmans grew, and without any pass from the Portuguese they despatched on their own behalf vessels loaded with pepper and ginger to the ports of Arabia. In the year 938 A.H., the Portuguese erected a fort at Jaliat, which is six karoh from K\u0101likot; and the passage of ships from Malabar was thereby rendered difficult. Similarly, the Christians in those years, during the reign of Burh\u0101n Niz\u0101m Sh\u0101h, erecting a fort at Raikundah close to the port of Jab\u016bl, settled down there. In the year 943 A.H., erecting a fort also at Kadatklor, the Christians acquired much power. At this time, Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Sulaim\u0101n, son of Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Salim of Turkey, planned\n\n1 The word \u1e0d\u0101r means both \u2018a Christian,\u2019 as well as a \u2018fire-worshipper.\u2019 In the latter sense, it would imply the \u2018Parsees.\u2019\n\n2 In 1598, Solyman the Magnificent, Emperor of Turkey, captured Aden (Hunter\u2019s History, Vol. II, p. 147). Constantinople, the capital of the old Eastern Roman Empire, is still known amongst Musalmans in India as \u2018R\u016bm.\u2019\n\n\u201cTo the \u2018martyr\u2019s blood\u2019 of the Portuguese, the Moslems opposed their Holy Fleet. First the Arabs of the Indian ports supplied the fighters for the faith. Then the Mameluke Sul\u1e6d\u0101n of Cairo sent armaments. Finally entered on the scene the mighty power of the Turkish Empire, which deemed its subjugation of Egypt incomplete as long as the Portuguese threatened the Red Sea. The Arabs of the Indian ports quickly succumbed to the cavaliers of the Cross. The Mameluke Sul\u1e6d\u0101n of Egypt, hard-pushed by the Ottommas from the north, could make no headway against the Portuguese in the east. But the Turks or \u2018Rumis\u2019 turned back the tide of Christian conquest in Asia. \u2018The cry, the Rumis are coming\u2019 which afflicted Albuquerque, for ever resounded in the ears of his successors. When the Portuguese closed the Malabar shore route to the Moslem world, the Arab ships struck boldly across the Indian Ocean for Aden to south of Ceylon, passing through the Maldive Island or far out at sea. When the Portuguese secured the strong position of Diu at the north entrance to Indian waters, the Turks constantly harassed that station and tried to outflank it by menacing the Portuguese factories westward on the Persian Gulf. When the Portuguese sought the enemy in the Red Sea, they were often repulsed, and their momentary successes at Aden ended in lasting failure. In vain the Lisbon Court tried to make a few years\u2019 arrangement with the Turks, offering in 1541 to supply pepper in exchange for wheat, and passes for Moslem ships in Indian waters in return for free entrance to Aden and the Arabian ports of the Red Sea. The unholy project came to nought. Four years later, in 1545, the Turks boldly attacked\nto turn out the Portuguese from the ports of India, and to take possession thereof himself. Accordingly, in the year 944 A.H., he sent his Vazir, Sulaim\u0101n P\u0101sh\u0101, with a fleet of one hundred warships to the port of Aden, in order to take it first, as it formed the key to the maritime position of India, and then to proceed to the ports of India. Sulaim\u0101n P\u0101sh\u0101 in that year wresting the port of Aden from Shaikh D\u0101ud, and slaying the latter, sailed out for the port of Deo, and commenced warfare. He had nearly stormed it, when his provisions and treasures ran short. Therefore, without accomplishing his mission, he sailed back to Turkey. And in the year 963 A.H., the Portuguese became dominant over the ports of Harm\u016bz\u00b9 and Muscat, over Sumatra, Malacca,\u00b2 Mil\u0101for, Nak, Fat\u0101n, Nashk\u016br, Ceylon, and over Bengal to the confines of China, and laid the foundations of forts at many places. But Sult\u0101n Ali Akhi stormed the fort of Sumatra; and the ruler of Ceylon also defeating the Portuguese, put a stop to their molestation over his country. And the Samr\u012b, ruler of K\u0101likot, being hard-pressed, sent envoys to Ali Adil Sh\u0101h, and persuaded the latter to fight with the Portuguese, and to expel them from his kingdom. And in the year 979 A.H., the Samr\u012b besieged and stormed the fort of Jal\u012bat, whilst N\u0101z\u012bm Sh\u0101h and Adil Sh\u0101h pushed on to R\u0101ikand\u0101h and Go\u0101h.\u00b3 The Samr\u012b, by the prowess of his men of bravery and heroism, captured the fort of Jal\u012bat, but N\u0101z\u012bm Sh\u0101h and Adil Sh\u0101h, owing to the venality of their disloyal officers who suffered themselves to be taken in by the bribes offered them by the Portuguese, had to retire without achieving their objects. From that time forward, the Portuguese\n\n\u00b9 I.e., Ormuz.\n\u00b2 Malacca was taken by the Portuguese under Albuquerque in 1511. See Dr. Hunter's History, Vol. I, p. 127.\n\u00b3 On the Portuguese seizing Goa in 1510, the Portuguese naval supremacy along the South-Western Indian coast was thoroughly established, and no Musalm\u0101n ship could safely trade in Malabar waters without a pass from the Christians. See Dr. Hunter's History of British India, Vol. I, p. 126.\n\nMy present object is merely to bring into view the struggle between Islam and Christendom for the Indian Ocean in the century preceding the appearance of the English on the scene. I dare not expand these preliminary chapters by the deeds of heroism and chivalrous devotion on both sides.\" See Dr. Hunter's History of British India, Vol. I, pp. 130-132.\nChristians, adopting a settled policy\\(^1\\) of molesting and oppressing the Musalm\u0101ns, perpetrated much highhandedness. Whilst some ships of Emperor Jal\u0101lu-d-din Mu\u1e25ammad Akbar, which without a pass from the Portuguese had proceeded to Makkah, were returning from the port of Jiddah, they looted them, and inflicted various molestations and humiliations on the Musalm\u0101ns, and set fire to the ports of Adil\u0101b\u0101d and Far\u0101bin which belonged to Adil Sh\u0101h, and ravaged them completely. And coming under the guise of traders to the port of Dabil, the Portuguese schemed by means of fraud and treachery to get hold of it also. But the Governor of that place, Khwajah Aliu-l-Mulk, a merchant of Shir\u0101z, becoming apprised of their intention, killed one hundred and fifty principal Portuguese, and quenched the fire of their disturbance.\n\n---\n\n**SECTION II.\u2014DESCRIPTIVE OF THE DOMINATION OF THE ENGLISH CHRISTIANS OVER THE DOMINIONS OF BENGAL, AND THE DAKHIN, &c.**\n\nBe it known to the minds of enlightened researchers, that from the date that the ships of Jal\u0101lu-d-din Mu\u1e25ammad Akbar P\u0101dsh\u0101h\\(^2\\) were captured at the hands of the Portuguese Christians, the sending of ships to the ports of Arabia and Ajam was totally suspended, inasmuch as the Emperor viewed the acceptance of passes from the Portuguese to be derogatory, whilst to send the ships without such passes was attended with danger to the lives of passengers, and with peril to their property.

Each side firmly believed itself fighting the battles of its God. 'I trust in the passion of Jesus Christ in whom I place all confidence,' Albuquerque declared in 1507 before entering on his governorship, 'to break the spirit of the Moors (Musalm\u0101ns).' 'We desire nought else but to be close to God' ran the Moslem summons in 1539. It denounced the aggressions 'of the Christians of Portugal,' and warned an Indian prince that if he held back, his soul would descend into hell.\" (Sulaiman P\u0113sh\u0101 to the ruler of Cambay, May 7th, 1539.)

And for some time the state of things continued in this wise. When Emperor Nuru-d-din Muhammad Jah\u0101ng\u012br ascended the throne of Dehli, he permitted the English Christians, who, in their articles of faith, totally differ from the Christian Portuguese and the Christian French, &c., and who thirst for the latter's blood, and are in hostility with the latter, to settle down in the tract of Surat,\u00b2 which pertained to the Province of Gujrat.\u00b3 This was the first place amongst the Indian sea-ports, where the English Christians settled down. Before this, the English Christians used to bring their trading ships to\n\n1 Abdur Rahim, Kh\u0101n-i-Khanan, was a son of Bairam Kh\u0101n, and was born at Lahore, 964 A.H. In 984, he was appointed to Gujrat. He conquered for Akbar Gujrat, and defeated Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Muzaffar, King of Gujrat, at the battle of Sarkij. His great deeds were the conquests of Gujrat and Sindh, and the defeat of Suhail Kh\u0101n of Bijapur. (See Blochamann's Translation of Ain-i-Akbari, Vol. I, p. 334).\n\n2 In 1607 Captain William Hawkins landed at Surat with a letter from James I. to the Mughal Emperor (Emperor Jahangir reigned 1605-1627), and proceeded to the Court at Agra. In 1611 Sir Henry Middleton landed at Swally. In 1612 Captain Best routed the Portuguese squadron near Surat, and obtained congratulations of the Mughal Governor, who allowed the English to settle at Surat in 1613. Downton's sea fight in 1615 established English supremacy over the Portuguese. In 1615, Sir Thomas Roe was sent by James I. to be 'ambassador to the Great Mogul.' Surat was the chief starting place for Mecca, and the Portuguese squadron had troubled the ocean path of pilgrimage. The Imperial Court, too happy that one infidel fleet should destroy another, granted to Sir Thomas Roe an 'order' for trade. Roe obtained a 'permit' in 1616 for the English to reside at Surat and to travel freely into the interior, and also a similar 'grant' in 1618 from Prince Khurram (afterwards Emperor Sh\u0101h Jahan) who was then Mughal Viceroy of Gujrat. The English by their good conduct gradually acquired the position of a useful sea-police, and as patrol of the Moalem pilgrim-ocean-route, and as a 'sure source of revenue,' under the Great Mughal. In 1657 the English Company decided that there should be one 'presidency' in India, that being at Surat. See Hunter's History of British India, Vol. II, Chap. II.\n\n3 Akbar conquered and re-conquered Gujrat and the province on the shore of the Gulf of Cambay between 1572-1592; and these were finally annexed to the Mughal Empire in 1593. Surat was the Capital of Gujrat and the Chief Mughal port on the western coast for the embarkation of pilgrims to Mecca. Surat is the modern representative of the ancient province of Surashtra which included not only Gujrat but part of Kathiwar. See Dr. Hunter's History, Vol. II, p. 47, and his reference to Cunningham's Ancient Geography of India.\nthe ports of India, and after sale of their cargoes used to sail back to their own country. After they settled down at Surat, the trading factories of the English Christians, like those of the Christian Portuguese and the French, &c., gradually sprang up at different centres both in the Dakhin\\(^1\\) and in Bengal,\\(^2\\) and they paid\n\n\\(^1\\) For the first English settlements on the Madras Coast (1611-1658), see Dr. Hunter's History of British India, Vol. II, Chap. III. Their first settlement under Captain Hippen on that coast was in 1611 at Masulipatam, the chief sea-port of the Moslem Golconda Kingdom (founded in 1512 under Kutab Shahi line on the breaking-up of the Musalman Bahmani Dynasty, and not subdued by the Mughal Empire until 1687). In 1632, the English received the 'Golden Phermaund' (farman) of the Golconda King for their settlement at Masulipatam. In 1639, the English under Francis Day built a factory at Madras. In 1645, the Moslem King of Golconda confirmed the grant of Madras for an English settlement. In 1658, Madras was raised to an independent 'presidency,' and in 1658, the English Company declared all its settlements in Bengal and the Coromandel Coast subordinate to Fort St. George.\n\n\\(^2\\) For an account of the English settlements in Bengal (between 1633-1658), see Hunter's History of 'British India,' Vol. II, Chap. IV, and Wilson's 'Early Annals of the English in Bengal,' Vol. I.\n\nIn 1632, by order of Emperor Shah Jahan, Qasim Khan destroyed the Portuguese settlement at Hugli, and expelled the Portuguese who had been ill-treating the Moslems. The English Company's agent at the Masulipatam factory seized the occasion, and sent out in 1633, on a country boat, eight Englishmen to try and open up trade with the fertile provinces at the mouth of the Ganges. These headed by Ralph Cartwright reached Harishpur in Orissa, and then quietly crept up to the court of Malcandy, in Fort Barabati, in Cuttack, where resided a Mughal Deputy-Governor for Orissa, named Agha Muhammad Zaman. This polite Persian\u2014the Deputy-Governor of Orissa\u2014received the Englishmen in his Audience-hall, affably inclined his head to Mr. Cartwright, then slipping off his sandal offered his foot to the English merchant to kiss, which he twice refused to do, but at last was fain to do it.' (Hunter's History, Vol. II, p. 89). The Deputy-Governor on May 5th, 1633, sealed an order giving the English ample license to trade. (See text of order in Wilson's Early Annals of the English in Bengal, Vol. I, pp. 11-12). The beginning of the English trade with Orissa is usually ascribed to a farman granted to the English in 1634 by Emperor Shah Jahan, confining them to Pippli near an old mouth of the Subarnarukha river. On May 6th, 1633, the English built a house of business at Hariharpur, near Jagatsingpur in the Cuttack district, this being the first English factory in the present Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal. In June, 1633, Cartwright founded a factory at Balasore. In 1650, the English founded a factory at Hugli. Gabriel Boughton, an English Surgeon, who was in 1650 Surgeon to Shah Shuja (Mughal Viceroy of Bengal who resided at Rajmahal), used his influence in the Vice-regal Court, in getting favour extended to the English, who received, in 1650\ncustoms-duties like others. During the reign of Emperor Aurangzeb Alamgir, the English rendered loyal services to the Emperor, and were, therefore, granted an Imperial Farman,\\(^1\\) permitting them to erect trading factories in the Imperial dominions generally, and in Bengal especially, and also remitting customs-duties on the ships of the English Company, in consideration of an annual payment by the latter of three thousand rupees, as has already been mentioned in connection with the foundation of Calcutta. From that time, the English acquired much prestige in Bengal.\n\nIn the year 1162 A.H., Nawab Muzaffar Jang, maternal grandson of Niz\u0101mu-l-Mulk A\u1e63af J\u0101h, at the instigation of \u1e24usain Dost alias Ch\u0101nd, who was one of the leading men of Arkat (Arcot), allied himself with the Christian French, and attacked Auw\u0101ru-d-din Kh\u0101n Shah\u0101mat Jang Gop\u0101mani, who was N\u0101\u1e93im of Arkat from the time of Naw\u0101b Niz\u0101mu-l-Mulk A\u1e63af J\u0101h, in order to wrest the province of Arkat. A great battle was fought, and Naw\u0101b Shah\u0101mat Jang, on the battle-field, displaying bravery and heroism, was killed. Naw\u0101b Niz\u0101mu-d-daulah, second son of Naw\u0101b A\u1e63af J\u0101h, who, on the death of his father, had succeeded to the maenad of the Viceroyalty of the Dakhin, on hearing of the hostility of his maternal nephew, with a force of seventy thousand cavalry and one hundred thousand infantry, set out to chastise Muzaffar Jang. Arriving at the port of B\u016blchari (Pondicherry) on the 26th Rab\u012bu-l-\u0100sw\u0101l 1163 A.H., Niz\u0101mu-d-daulah fought a battle, in which he triumphed, whilst Muzaffar Jang was captured. Niz\u0101mu-d-daulah spent the rainy season at Arkat. The Christians of B\u016blchari (Pondichery) conspired with Himmat Kh\u0101n and other Afgh\u0101n generals of Karnatik, who were servants of Niz\u0101mu-d-daulah, and deceiving them by holding out temptations of lands and treasures, blinded their sense of obliga-\n\n\\(^{a}\\) 'nishan' or 'permit' from Shah Shuja to trade duty-free in Bengal on payment of Rs. 3,000.\n\n\\(^{1}\\) His Majesty Emperor Aurangzeb on 27th February, 1690, granted a farman to the English. The farman sets forth that 'all the English having made a most humble, submissive petition that the ill-crimes they have done may be pardoned,' and promised to pay a fine of Rs. 150,000, to restore all plundered goods, and behave themselves no more in such a shameful manner, the Emperor accepts their submission and grants them a new license for trade, on condition that 'Mr. Child, who did the disgrace, be turned out and expelled.'

Those traitors tied up the waist of mutiny and treachery, and conspiring with the Christians of B\u00fclchari (Pondicherry), on the night of the sixteenth Muharram, 1174 A.H., delivered a night-attack, and killed Naw\u0101b N\u012bz\u0101mu-d-daulah. After the fall of Naw\u0101b N\u012bz\u0101mu-d-daulah, the Afgh\u0101ns and the Christians (the French) placed Naw\u0101b Mu\u1e93affar Jang on the masnad. Mu\u1e93affar Jang proceeded to B\u00fclchari (Pondicherry) with a contingent of the Afgh\u0101ns, and taking a large number of Christian French in his service made them his confidants. In the same year, taking a large force consisting of Afgh\u0101ns and Christians, he set out for Haidar\u0101bad, and crossing the confines of Arkat came to the Afgh\u0101n tract. From the vicissitude of fortune, hostility broke out between Mu\u1e93affar Jang and the Afgh\u0101ns, and it led to a fight. On the 17th Rabiul-aw\u0101l of the aforesaid year, both sides arranged themselves in battle-array. On one side were arrayed Mu\u1e93affar Jang and the Christian French, and on the other the Afgh\u0101ns. Himmat Kh\u0101n and other Afghan Generals, meeting with their deserts for disloyalty, were killed, whilst Mu\u1e93affar Jang from an arrow-shot which pierced the pupil of his eye was also killed. After this, the Christian French entered the service of Amiru-l-Mum\u0101lik Sal\u0101bat Jang, third son of A\u1e63af Jah, received as j\u0101girs Sikak\u016bl and R\u0101jbandari, &c., and acquired so much influence, that their orders became current in the Dakhin. No Musalman ruler had before this taken into employ the Christian French, though from a long period they used to frequent the ports of the Dakhin. It was Mu\u1e93affar Jang who taking the Christian French into his service, introduced them into the Moslem dominions. When the Christian French acquired so much influence, the Christian English, who thirsted for the blood of the French, also cherished ambition to meddle with the Imperial dominions, acquired possession of some tracts in the Dakhin, brought the fort of S\u016brat into their own possession, and established fortified factories in Bengal. In that the French slaying Naw\u0101b Anw\u0101ru-d-din Kh\u0101n Gopamani, the \u0160\u016bbahd\u0101r of Arkat, and nominally installing another person at its head, had become dominant in the Dakhin, Naw\u0101b Mu\u1e25ammad \u0100li Kh\u0101n, son of Naw\u0101b Anw\u0101ru-d-din Khan, entered into an alliance with the English Chiefs. The latter advancing to the assistance of Naw\u0101b Mu\u1e25ammad Ali Kh\u0101n spared no measure to help him, and exerted themselves strenuously to exterminate the French. In 1174 A.H., the English besieged\nthe fort of B\u00fblchar\u00ee (Pondichery), and wresting it from the hands of the French raised it, whilst Sikak\u00fbl, R\u00e2jbandari, and other Jag\u00eers were unexpectedly abandoned by the French. Naw\u00e2b Muhammad Ali Kh\u00e2n, with the support of the English, succeeded his father on the throne of the Viceroyalty of Arkat (Arcot), under the surname of W\u00e2l\u00e2j\u00e2h Amiru-l-Hind Muhammad Ali Kh\u00e2n Man\u00e7\u00fbr Jang, subordinated himself to the English Chiefs, and passed his life in ease and pleasure. Now the province of Arkat (Arcot), like Bengal, is under the domination of the English Chiefs.\n\nAnd as has been related before, when Nawab Sir\u00e2ju-d-danlah, N\u00e2zim of Bengal, owing to his inexperience, flung the stone into the hornet's nest, he suffered of necessity the sting. And Naw\u00e2b Jafar Ali Kh\u00e2n, treating the English as his confidants and colleagues in the Ni\u1e93\u0101mat of Bengal, suffered them to acquire control over administrative affairs. Inasmuch as complete disintegration had overtaken the Moslem Empire of Delhi, in every \u0160\u00fbbah the Provincial Governors acquiring authority grew into semi-independent Fendatories. Now, since a period of thirty years, the Provinces of Bengal, Bih\u00e2r, and Orissa have come into the possession and authority of the English Chiefs. An English Chief, styled the Governor-General, coming from England, resides in Calcutta, and selecting Deputies for the collection of the revenue and for administration of civil and criminal justice, and for trading business, sends them out to every place. And establishing the Kh\u00e2li\u1e63ah Kachiri\u00b9 (the Court of Crown-lands) in Calcutta, the English Governor settles on his own behalf the assessment of the revenue of each Z\u00eela (District). And the Deputies and the Zilad\u00e2rs (District Officers) collecting revenues, remit them to Calcutta.\n\nIn the year 1178 A.H., when the English became victorious\u00b2 over Naw\u00e2b Vaz\u00eeru-l-Mulk Shuj\u00e2u-d-danlah, N\u00e2zim of the \u0160\u00fbbah of Audh and Ilah\u00e2b\u00e2d (Allahabad), a treaty was entered into, and the English left to the Nawab Vaz\u00eer his country. From that time, they have acquired influence over that \u0160\u00fbbah also, and seizing the district of Ban\u00e2ras have separated it from that \u0160\u00fbbah. And their soldiers quartering themselves in the dominions of the Nawab-Vaz\u00eer, as the\n\n\u00b9 That is, the Board of Revenue or the 'Sudder Board.'\n\u00b2 For this victory and the treaty that followed, see note ante and Seir-ul-Mutakkerin.\nlatter's servants, exercise influence over all affairs. Heaven knows what would be the eventual upshot of this state of things.\n\nSimilarly, in the Dakhin, the English have got in the fort of Madras an old factory and a large army. They have also acquired possession of the Province of Arkat. They hold, as j\u0101g\u012brs under Niz\u0101m Ali Kh\u0101n, the towns of Ganj\u0101m, Barampur, J\u014dhap\u016br, Siksk\u016bl, Ish\u0101qpatan, the fort of Qasim kotha, R\u0101jbandar, Ilor (Ellore), Machlibandar (Masullipatam), B\u0101jw\u0101rah, and the fort of Kondbali, &c., and the Zamind\u0101rs of those places appearing before them pay in revenue. And whenever Niz\u0101m Ali Kh\u0101n needs auxiliaries, they furnish him with strong contingents, and outwardly do not disobey his orders.\n\nBut the English Christians\\(^1\\) are embellished with the ornaments of wisdom and tact, and adorned with the garments of considerateness and courtesy. They are matchless in the firmness of their resolutions, in the perfectness of their alertness, in the organisation of battles, and in the arrangement of feasts. They are also unrivalled in their laws for the administration of justice, for the safety of their subjects, for extermination of tyranny, and for protection of the weak. Their adherence to their promises is so great that even if they risk their lives, they do not deviate from their words, nor do they admit liars to their society. They are liberal, faithful, forbearing, and honourable. They have not learnt the letters of deceit, nor have they read the book of crookedness. And notwithstanding their difference in creed, they do not interfere with the faith, laws, and religion of Musalmans.\n\nAll wranglings between Christianity and Islam, after all, lead to the same place:\n\nThe dream (of empire) is one and the same, only its interpretations vary.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The author of the *Riyaz* appears to be remarkably liberal and catholic in his views, as the concluding lines of his History would indicate. Compare this picture of the 'new English rulers' with that in the *Seir-ul-Muta'kerin*.\n\n**THE END.**\nERRATA.\n\nP. xxiii, for 'prisoner' read 'Governor.'\nP. 9, for 'Bakhtiyar Khilji' read
