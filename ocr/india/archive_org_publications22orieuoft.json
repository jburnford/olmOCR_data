(Retired)\n\nSECOND VOLUME\n\nLONDON\nROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY\n22 ALBEMARLE STREET\n1914\nPREFACE\n\nAfter an interval of about five years, the second volume of Mr. Alexander Rogers' translation of Jahangir's Memoirs has been published by the Royal Asiatic Society. It is a smaller work than the first volume, for it only extends over six years of the reign, as against the twelve years of its predecessor. Even then it does not include the whole of the reign, for that lasted twenty-two years. The two volumes, however, contain all that Jahangir wrote or supervised. It will be found, I think, that the present volume is fully as interesting as its predecessor. The accounts of the Zodiacal coinage (pp. 6 and 7), and of the comet, or new star (p. 48), the notice of the Plague in Agra (pp. 65-67), and the elaborate description of Kashmir, under the chronicle of the 15th year, are valuable, and a word should be said for the pretty story of the King and the Gardener's daughter (p. 50), and for the allusions to painters and pictures.\n\nIf B\u0101bur, who was the founder of the Moghul Empire in India, was the C\u00e6sar of the East, and if the many-sided Akbar was an epitome of all the great Emperors, including Augustus, Trajan, Hadrian, Marcus Aurelius, Julian, and Justinian, Jahangir was certainly of the type of the Emperor Claudius, and so bore a close resemblance to our James I. All three were weak men, and under the influence of their favourites, and all three were literary, and at least two of them were fond of dabbling in theology. All three were in their wrong places as rulers. Had James I. (and VI. of Scotland) been, as he half wished, the Keeper of the Bodleian, and Jahangir been head of a Natural History Museum, they would have been better and happier men. Jahangir's best\npoints were his love of nature and powers of observation, and his desire to do justice. Unfortunately, the last of these merits was vitiated by a propensity for excessive and recondite punishments. Like his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, he was addicted to drugs and alcohol, and he shortened his life in this way. He made no addition to the imperial territories, but, on the contrary, diminished them by losing Qandahar to the Persians. But possibly his peaceful temper, or his laziness, was an advantage, for it saved much bloodshed. His greatest fault as a king was his subservience to his wife, N\u016br-Jah\u0101n, and the consequent quarrel with his son, Shah Jahan, who was the ablest and best of his male children. The last years of his reign were especially melancholy, for he suffered from asthma and other diseases; and he had to endure the ignominy of being for a while a captive to one of his own servants\u2014Mah\u0101bat Kh\u0101n. He died on the borders of Kashmir, when on his way to Lahore, in October, 1627, in the fifty-ninth year of his age, and was buried at Sh\u0101hdara, near Lahore, where his widow, N\u016br-Jah\u0101n, and her brother are also interred. At the time of his death his son Shah Jahan was at Junair in the Deccan, and there the news was conveyed in a wonderfully short time by a Hindu courier. Jahangir was succeeded by Shah Jahan, who lost no time in getting rid of his relatives, for, like the Turk, he bore no kinsman near the throne. Indeed, he is strongly suspected of having killed his elder brother, Khusrau, several years before.\n\nI am indebted to Mr. Ellis, of the India Office, for revising the proofs.\n\nNOTE.\n\nIn the Catalogue of Manuscripts in the Library of Trinity College, Dublin, p. 416, mention is made of a history of Hindustan during the reign of Jahangir, in two volumes, with paintings (Ouseley MSS.). I have recently ascertained that the MS. is only a modern copy of the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma.\n\nH.

Twelve years had now passed from the august Accession of this suppliant at the throne of God, in prosperity, and the New Year began in joy and thanksgiving. On Thursday, 2 Farward\u012bn, Divine month, the festival of my Lunar weighment took place, and the fifty-first * year of the age of this suppliant at God\u2019s throne began with rejoicings. I trust that my life will be spent in the doing of God\u2019s Will, and that not a breath of it will pass without remembering Him. After the weighment had been finished, a fresh feast of joy was arranged, and my domestic servants celebrated the day with brimming cups.\n\nOn this day \u0100\u1e63af K. (N\u016br-Jah\u0101n\u2019s brother), who held the rank of 5,000 with 3,000 horse, was favoured by the grant of 4,000 two-horsed and three-horsed troopers, and \u0160\u0101bit K. was raised to the office of Examiner of Petitions. I bestowed the post of the Artillery on Mu\u2018tamid K. A Kachh (Cutch) horse had been brought as an offering by the son of Dil\u0101war K. No horse so good as this had come into my establishment till I encamped in Gujarat, and as M. Rustam showed a great liking for it, I presented it to him. On the J\u0101m were conferred four rings\u2014viz., diamond, ruby, emerald, and sapphire\n\n* Jah\u0101ng\u012br was born on Wednesday, 17 Rab\u012b\u2018u-l-awwal, 977 A.H., or August 31, 1569, and so on March 11, 1618, or 23 Rab\u012b\u2018u-l-awwal, 1027, he was in the beginning of his fifty-first lunar year. By solar computation he was not yet fifty, that is, he was in his fiftieth year. The text wrongly has 1017 instead of 1027.\n\u2014and two hawks. I also gave four rings\u2014viz., ruby, cat\u2019s-eye, emerald, and sapphire\u2014to Raja Lachm\u012b Nar\u0101yan (of K\u016bch Bih\u0101r). Muruwwat K. had sent three elephants from Bengal, and two of them were included in my private stud. On the eve of Friday I ordered lamps to be placed round the tank, and this had a very good appearance. On Sunday \u1e24\u0101j\u012b Rafiq came from \u2018Ir\u0101q, and had the good fortune to kiss the threshold, and laid before me a letter which my brother Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s had sent with him. The aforesaid person is a slave of M\u012br Mu\u1e25ammad Amin K., the caravan leader, and the M\u012br had brought him up from his childhood. In truth, he is an excellent servant. He frequently visited \u2018Ir\u0101q, and became intimate with my brother Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s. This time he had brought tipch\u0101q* horses and fine cloth-stuffs, such that of the horses some were put into the private stables. As he is a skilful slave, and a servant worthy of favour, I honoured him with the title of Maliku-t-tujj\u0101r (King of Merchants). On Monday I gave Raja Lachm\u012b Nar\u0101yan a special sword, a jewelled rosary, and four pearls for ear-rings. On Mub\u0101rak-shamba (Thursday) I increased by 500 horse the mans\u0101b of 5,000 personal and 1,000 horse held by M\u012brz\u0101 Rustam; I\u2019tiq\u0101d K. was promoted to a mans\u0101b of 4,000 and 1,000 horse; Sarfar\u0101z K. was promoted to a mans\u0101b of 2,500 and 1,400 horse; Mu\u2018tamid K. to the rank of 1,000 with 350 horse. On An\u012br\u0101\u2019\u012b Singh-dalan and Fid\u0101\u2019\u012b K., horses worth 100 muhars were conferred. As the guarding and administration of the Punjab had been entrusted to I\u2019tim\u0101du-d-daula, I, at his request, promoted to the government (\u1e25uk\u016bmat) of the said \u1e62ubah, M\u012br Q\u0101sim, the Bakhsh\u012b of the A\u1e25ad\u012bs, who is related to him, and bestowed on him a mans\u0101b of 1,000 personal with 400 horse and the title of Q\u0101sim K. Before this I had given Raja Lachm\u012b Nar\u0101yan an \u2018Ir\u0101q horse. On this day I conferred on him an elephant and a Turk\u012b horse, and gave him leave to go to Bengal. The J\u0101m was dismissed to his native country with a present of a jewelled waist-sword,\n\n* Text wrongly has panch\u0101q. In Turki dictionaries it is spelt topch\u0101q, and means a large or long-necked horse. See P. de Courteille Dict., etc.\na jewelled rosary, two horses, one from \u2018Ir\u0101q and the other a Turk\u012b, and a dress of honour. \u0160\u0101lih, brother\u2019s son of the deceased \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n,* was promoted to a mans\u0101b of 1,000 with 300 horse, and allowed to go to Bengal, and a horse was conferred on him. On this date M\u012br Jumla\u2020 came from Persia, and had the good fortune to pay his respects. The aforesaid is one of the respectable Sayyids of Isfahan and his family have always been held in honour in Persia, and now his brother\u2019s son, M\u012br R\u012bz\u0101, is in the service of my brother, Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s, and has the rank of \u0160adr, and the Shah has married him to his own daughter. M\u012br Jumla had left Persia fourteen years before this, and gone to Golconda to Mu\u1e25ammad Qul\u012b Qu\u1e6dbu-l-mulk. His name is Mu\u1e25ammad Am\u012bn. Qu\u1e6dbu-l-mulk gave him the title of M\u012br Jumla. For ten years he had been his Mud\u0101r \u2018Alaihi (Centre of Affairs) and his \u0160\u0101h\u012bb S\u0101m\u0101n (factotum). After Qu\u1e6dbu-l-mulk died, and the rule came to his brother\u2019s son, the latter did not treat the M\u012br properly, and so he took leave and hastened to his native country. The Shah, on account of his connection with M\u012br R\u012bz\u0101, and the respect which he had for men\u2021 of merit, showed much consideration for and kindness to him. He (the M\u012br) also presented fitting offerings, and passed three or four years in Persia, and amassed properties (estates?).\u00a7 As he several times represented that he wished to enter the service of this Court, I sent a farm\u0101n and invited him. Immediately the farm\u0101n arrived he severed his connections there, and set the face of loyalty towards this Court. This day he attained the\n\n* \u0100\u1e63af K. III. of Blochmann; his name was Ja\u02bffar Beg.\n\n\u2020 See \u201cIqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma,\u201d p. 111, etc. He is not the famous M\u012br Jumla, who was Aurangzeb\u2019s general, though possibly the latter was his son. According to the \u201cIqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, he was the nephew, and not the uncle, of M\u012br R\u012bz\u0101, but Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s statement agrees with the \u2018\u0100lam-\u0101r\u0101\u02bei (p. 623). M\u012br Jumla\u2019s patron, Mu\u1e25ammad Qul\u012b Qu\u1e6db-Sh\u0101h, died in 1612. He himself died in 1637, while Aurangzeb\u2019s general died in 1663.\n\n\u2021 Possibly what is meant is that Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s was greedy after M\u012br Jumla\u2019s (S\u0101m\u0101n) wealth. K\u0101mg\u0101r \u1e24usain\u012b distinctly says that \u2018Abb\u0101s wanted to get hold of M\u012br Jumla\u2019s goods.\n\n\u00a7 The Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma says that \u2018Abb\u0101s only gave M\u012br Jumla flattering words, and did not give him any high appointment.

As he had come with devotion and sincerity, I conferred favours and kindness on him, and presented him with 20,000 *darbs* (Rs. 10,000) for his expenses and a dress of honour. On the same day I gave the post of *Bakhsh\u012b* of the *A\u1e25ad\u012bs* to \u2018In\u0101yat K. in place of Q\u0101sim K. I honoured *Khw\u0101ja* \u2018\u0100qil, who is one of the old servants, with the title of \u2018\u0100qil K., and presented him with a horse. On Friday, Dil\u0101war K., coming from the Deccan, had the good fortune to kiss the threshold, and presented an offering of 100 *muhars* and Rs. 1,000. B\u0101qir K., Faujd\u0101r of Multan, was promoted to a *man\u1e63ab* of 800 personal and 300 horse. Tij\u0101rat K. and B\u0101h\u016b\u2019\u012b,\u2020 Zamindar of Multan, were honoured with the gift of elephants. On Saturday, the 11th, marching from Dohad with the intention of hunting elephants, I pitched at the village of Kara B\u0101ra (G\u0101rbara ?). On Sunday, the 12th, the village of Saj\u0101ra (Sajwara ?) became the place of alighting. It is 8 *koss* from this place to Dohad, and 1\u00bd *koss* to the hunting-ground. On the morning of Monday, the 13th, I went to hunt elephants with a body of my private servants. As the grazing-place of the elephants is in a hilly country, with elevations and depressions, a passage is obtained with difficulty by one on foot. Before this, a large body of horse and foot had surrounded the jungle after the manner of a *gamurgha*, and outside the jungle, on a tree, they had prepared a wooden platform for me. On all sides of this they had arranged seats on other trees for the Amirs. They had got ready 200 male elephants with strong nooses, and many female elephants. On each elephant there were seated two elephant-drivers of the tribe of *Jarga*,\u2021 whose special em-\n\n---\n\n* Tuq\u016bz means \u201cnine,\u201d but perhaps it is here only used to express a gift, and the pieces of cloth were perhaps only nine, and not eighty-one. See Vullers s.v., who refers to Quatrem\u00e8re.\n\n\u2020 The I.O. MSS. have M\u0101m\u016b\u2019\u012b, and the meaning may be \u201cthe maternal uncle of the Zamindar.\u201d\n\n\u2021 Jariya in No. 181. It seems to be the Jareja tribe of Ab\u016b-l-Fa\u017cl, Jarrett II, 250. Compare Blochmann\u2019s translation, p. 285 n., of the corresponding passage in the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma. The tribe is there called Jhariyah.\nployment is the hunting of elephants, and it had been arranged that they should bring the wild elephants from the jungle into my presence, that I might witness the hunt. It happened that at the time when the men from all sides entered the jungle, in consequence of the thickness of the forest and the heights and hollows, the chain was broken, and the order of the qamurgha did not remain perfect. The wild elephants in bewilderment turned in every direction, but twelve male and female came to this side (where J. was). As the fear was that they might escape, they drove in the tame elephants and tied them (the wild elephants) up wherever they found them. Although many elephants were not caught, at least two excellent ones were captured, very handsome in shape, of good breed, and perfect marks. As there is a hill in the jungle in which the elephants were, called R\u0101kas (R\u0101kshas) Pah\u0101r,* or demon hill, I called these two elephants R\u0101van Sar and P\u0101van Sar, these being the names of two demons. On Tuesday, the 14th, and Kam-shamba (Wednesday), the 15th, I halted.\n\nOn the eve of Thursday, the 16th, I marched, and halted at the stage of Kara B\u0101ra. H\u0101kim Beg,\u2020 who is one of the household of the Court, was honoured with the title of H\u0101kim K., and a sum of Rs. 3,000 was given to Sangr\u0101m, a Zamindar of the hill country of the Panjab. As the heat was very great, and marching by day was to be avoided, I marched by night. On Saturday, the 18th, a halt was made in the parganah of Dohad. On Sunday, the 19th, the sun that bestows favour on the world attained the highest point in the constellation of Aries. On this day a great entertainment was held, and I sat on the throne. I promoted Sh\u0101h-naw\u0101z K., who held a mansab of 5,000, with the favour of 2,000 horse, of two and three horses. Khw\u0101ja Ab\u016b-l-Hasan, the Chief Bakhsh\u012b, was given a mansab, original and increased, of 4,000 with 2,000 horse. As Al\u012bmad Beg K., of Kabul, who\n\n* This must be P\u0101v\u0101garh, a hill fort in the P\u0101nch Mah\u0101l district, which is 2,800 feet above the sea. See I.G.

K\u0101k\u0101r to the Government of Kashmir. I gave him a dress of honour and an elephant, and sent him off. He also made a promise in writing that in the course of two years he would conquer Tibet and Kishtw\u0101r. Badi\u2018u-z-Zam\u0101n, s. Sh\u0101hrukh M. came from the jagir he held in Sul\u1e6d\u0101np\u016br, and had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. Having at this time honoured Q\u0101sim K. with a jewelled dagger and an elephant, I dismissed him to the Government of the Punjab.\n\nOn the night of Tuesday, the 21st, I marched from the stage mentioned, and turned the reins of the army of prosperity towards Al\u1e25madabad. As in consequence of the great heat and the corruption of the air I would have had to undergo much hardship, and would have had to traverse a long distance before reaching Agra, it occurred to me not to proceed at this hot season to the capital. As I heard much praise of the rainy season in Gujarat, and there was no report about the evil reputation of Al\u1e25madabad (see infra for account of epidemic there), I finally conceived the idea of remaining there. Inasmuch as the protection and guardianship of God (to Him be praise) was in all places and at all times extended to this suppliant, just at this crisis news arrived that signs of the plague (wab\u0101) had shown themselves again at Agra, and many people were dying, my intention of not going to Agra, which had thrown its rays on my mind through Divine inspiration, was confirmed. The entertainment of Thursday, the 23rd, was held at the station of Jalod.*\n\nPreviously to this, the rule of coinage was that on one face of the metal they stamped my name, and on the reverse the name of the place, and the month and year of the reign. At this time it entered my mind that in place of the month they should substitute the figure of the constellation which belonged to that month; for instance, in the month of Far-\n\n* Jh\u0101lod in the Doh\u0101d ta\u2018l\u016bqa of the P\u0101nch Mah\u0101l district, Bombay.\nwardin the figure of a ram, and in Urdibihisht the figure of a bull. Similarly, in each month that a coin was struck, the figure of the constellation was to be on one face, as if the sun were emerging from it. This usage is my own, and has never been practised until now.*\n\nOn this day I\u2018tiq\u0101d K. was promoted to the dignity of a standard, and a standard was also conferred on Muruwwat K., who was attached to Bengal. On the night of Monday,\u2020 the 27th, the camp was pitched in the village of Badrw\u0101la, in the parganah of Sahra.\u2021 At this stage was heard the voice of the koel (koyal). The koel is a bird of the crow tribe, but smaller. The crow\u2019s eyes are black, and those of the koel red. The female has white spots, but the male is all black. The male has a very pleasant voice, quite unlike that of the female. It is in reality the nightingale of India. Just as the nightingale is agitated and noisy in the spring, so is the cry of the koel at the approach of the rainy season, which is the spring of Hindustan. Its cry is exceedingly pleasant and penetrating, and the bird begins its exhilaration (mast\u012b) when the mangoes ripen. It frequently sits on the mango-trees, and is delighted with the colour and scent of the mango. A strange thing about the koel is that it does not bring up its young from the egg, but, finding the nest of the crow unguarded at the time of laying, it breaks the crow\u2019s eggs with its beak, throws them out, and lays its own in the place of them, and flies off. The crow, thinking the eggs its own, hatches the young and brings them up. I have myself seen this strange affair at Allahabad.\n\nOn the night of Kamshamba (Wednesday), the 29th, the camp was on the bank of the Mah\u012b, and the entertainment of Mub\u0101rakshamba was held there. Two springs appeared on the bank of the Mah\u012b, that had very clear water, so much so that if a poppy-seed fell into them the whole of it was visible. All that day I passed with the ladies. As it was a pleasant\n\n* The text (pp. 227, 228) has drawings of the twelve Zodiacal coins.

On Friday I fished in the Mah\u012b, and large fish with scales fell into the net. I first told my son, Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n, to try his sword on them. After this I ordered the Am\u012brs to strike them with the swords they had in their belts. My son\u2019s sword cut better than all of theirs. These fish were divided among the servants who were present.\n\nOn the eve of Saturday, the 1st of Urdibihisht, marching from the above-mentioned stage, I ordered* the mace-bearers (yas\u0101wul\u0101n) and taw\u0101chiy\u0101n to collect the widows and poor people from the villages on the road and near it, and bring them before me, so that I might bestow charity on them with my own hand, which would be an occupation, and the helpless ones might also find grace. What better occupation could there be than this? On Monday, the 3rd, Shaj\u0101\u2018at K. \u2018Arab, and Himmat K., and other servants who belonged to the Deccan and Gujarat, had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. The holy men and the possessors of blessing (faqirs, etc.) who lived at Almadabad paid their respects to me. On Tuesday, the 4th, the bank of the river at Mahm\u016bd\u0101b\u0101d became the alighting place. Rustam K., whom my son, Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n, had left in the Government of Gujarat, was honoured by paying his respects. The entertainment of Thursday, the 6th, was held on the bank of the K\u0101nkriya tank. N\u0101hir K., according to order, came from the Deccan and raised the head of honour with the good fortune of prostrating himself before me.\n\nA diamond ring was presented to my son, Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n, as part of the offering of Qutbu-l-mulk. It was of the value of 1,000 muhars, and on it there appeared three letters of equal size and of good form, such that they made the word Lillahi (for God). This diamond had been sent, as it was reckoned one of the marvels of the world. In fact, veins and scratches are flaws in precious stones, but it was generally thought that the marks on this one were fabricated. Moreover, the diamond did not come from any celebrated mine. As my son, Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n, wished that it should be sent to my brother, Sh\u0101h\n\n* Quoted by Blochmann, Calcutta Review, 1869, p. 128.\n\u2018Abb\u0101s, as a souvenir of the conquest of the Deccan it was sent to the Shah along with other gifts.*\n\nOn this day I presented Brikha R\u0101y b\u0101d-far\u016bsh (panegyrist) with Rs. 1,000. He is a Gujarati by origin, and is fully versed in the chronicles and circumstances of that country. His name was B\u016bnt\u0101\u2014that is, a sapling (n\u012bh\u0101l). It seemed to me that it was anomalous to call an old man B\u016bnt\u0101, especially now that he had become verdant (sar-sabz) and fruit-bearing through the irrigation (sah\u0101b, literally, cloud, or mirage) of our kindness. I therefore ordered that henceforth he should be called Brikha R\u0101y. Brikha means \u201ctree\u201d in Hind\u012b. On Friday, the 7th of the aforesaid month, corresponding with the 1st Jum\u0101da-l-awwal, at a chosen propitious hour, I entered the city of Ahmadabad with all enjoyment. At the time of mounting, my son of prosperous fortune, Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n, had brought 20,000 charan, or Rs. 5,000, for the n\u012bs\u0101r (scattering), and I scattered them as I hastened to the palace. When I alighted there he laid before me by way of an offering a jewelled turra (aigrette) of the value of Rs. 25,000, and those of his officers whom he had left in this Subah also presented offerings. They altogether amounted to nearly Rs. 40,000.\n\nAs it was represented to me that Khw\u0101ja Beg Mirz\u0101 Safaw\u012b had reached the neighbourhood of the forgiveness of God\u2014i.e., had died\u2014at Ahmadvagar, I promoted to a mansab of 2,000 personal and horse, original and increased, Khanjar K., whom he had adopted as his son, and, indeed, held dearer than a son of his loins, and who was in truth, an intelligent, ambitious youth, and a servant worthy of patronage, and entrusted him with the charge of the fort of Ahmadnagar.\n\n* The text has dar z\u012br-i-\u0101n (\u201cunder it\u201d) in mentioning the position of the letters, but the I.O. MS. No. 181, has dar zabar (\u201cabove\u201d or \u201con it\u201d). The words khatt-i-muharraf might mean \u201cinverted or slanting letters,\u201d and Mr. Rogers has taken the passage to mean that two of the letters were on a line with one another, and that the third was inverted and below the other two. But muhrif, as the word may also be read, has the meaning of \u201chandsome,\u201d and I think this is the meaning here. Possibly the meaning is that there was a letter or mark above\u2014viz., the tashd\u012bd. Another meaning may be that all three letters were equal in size, and in a slanting position on the stone.\nIn these days, in consequence of the great heat and the corruption of the air, sickness had broken out among the people, and of those in the city and the camp there were few who for two or three days had not been ill. Inflammatory fever or pains in the limbs attacked them, and in the course of two or three days they became exceedingly ill\u2014so much so that even after recovery they remained for a long time weak and languid. They mostly at last recovered, so that but few were in danger of their lives. I heard from old men who resided in this country that thirty years before this the same kind of fever prevailed, and passed away happily. Anyhow, there appeared some deterioration in the climate of Gujarat, and I much regretted having come here. I trust that the great and glorious God, in His mercy and grace, will lift up this burden, which is a source of uneasiness to my mind, from off the people. On Mub\u0101rak-shamba (Thursday), the 13th, Badi\u2018u-z-zam\u0101n, s. Mirz\u0101 Sh\u0101hrukh, was promoted to the mansab of 1,500 personal and horse, and presented with a standard, and appointed faujd\u0101r of Sark\u0101r Pa\u1e6dan. Sayyid Niz\u0101m, faujd\u0101r of Sark\u0101r Lucknow, was raised to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 700 horse. The man\u1e63ab of \u2018Al\u012b Qul\u012b Darman, who was attached to the province of Qandahar, at the request of Bah\u0101dur K., the governor thereof, was ordered to be 1,000 personal and 700 horse. Sayyid Hizbar K. B\u0101rha was dignified with the man\u1e63ab of 1,000 personal and 400 horse. I promoted Zabardast K. to the rank of 800 personal and 350 horse. On this day Q\u0101sim Khw\u0101ja of Dihb\u012bd* had sent from M\u0101-war\u0101\u2019-a-n-nahr (Transoxiana) by the hand of one of his tribesmen by way of supplication five t\u016bygh\u016bn (white) falcons. One died on the road, and four arrived at Ujjain in safety. I ordered them to hand over the sum of Rs. 5,000 to someone among them, that he might purchase and take with him whatever things would be agreeable to the Khw\u0101ja, and gave a reward of Rs. 1,000 to himself. At this time Kh\u0101n \u2018Alam, who had been sent as ambassador to the ruler of Persia, sent an \u0101shy\u0101nt\u012b falcon (bird from the nest), which in\n\n* Dihb\u012bd, \u201cthe village of the willow,\u201d a well-known place in Transoxiana. It is Dihband in text.\nthe Persian language they call *ukna.* Outwardly one cannot distinguish between these and *b\u0101z d\u0101m\u012b*\u2020 falcons by any particular mark, but after they have been flown the difference is clear. On Thursday, the 20th, M\u012br Ab\u016b-s-\u1e62\u0101li\u1e25, a relation (? son-in-law) of the deceased M\u012brz\u0101 Y\u016bsuf K., came from the Deccan by order, and enjoyed the good fortune of kissing the threshold. He presented as an offering 100 *muhars*\u2021 and a jewelled plume (*kalg\u012b*). M\u012brz\u0101 Y\u016bsuf K.\u00a7 was one of the R\u012bzaw\u012b Sayyids of Mashhad, and his family was always held in great honour in Khurasan, and just now my brother Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s has given his daughter in marriage to the younger brother of the aforesaid Ab\u016b-s-\u1e62\u0101li\u1e25. His father, M\u012brz\u0101 Atagh,|| was the head of the attendants of the mausoleum of Riz\u0101, the 8th Imam. M\u012brz\u0101 Y\u016bsuf Kh\u0101n, by means of the patronage of H.M. (Akbar), had risen to nobility, and attained to the mans\u0101b of 5,000. Without doubt he was a good M\u012br, and held his many servants in good order. A number of relations gathered round him. He died\u00b6 in the Deccan. Although he left many sons, who obtained favours in consideration of former services, special attention was paid to the development of his eldest son. In a short time I advanced him to the rank of nobility. Certainly there is a great difference between him and his father.\n\nOn *Mub\u0101rak-shamba* (Thursday), the 27th, I presented \u1e24ak\u012bm Mas\u012b\u1e25u-z-zam\u0101n with 20,000 *darbs* (8 anna pieces), and to \u1e24ak\u012bm R\u016b\u1e25u-llah 100 *muhars* and Rs. 1,000. As he had thoroughly diagnosed my constitution, he perceived that the climate of Gujarat was very inimical to it. He said: \u201cAs soon as you moderate your habit of taking wine and opium,\n\n---\n\n* Ukna. The word appears to be Arabic, and signifies a nest. It is commonly written *wukna.*\n\n\u2020 *B\u0101z d\u0101m\u012b* apparently means hawks reared in captivity, or it may mean hawks brought by dealers\u2014*d\u0101m\u012b*. Information about hawks may be found in Blochmann, 293, etc., and in Col. Phillott\u2019s recent articles in the J.A.S.B., May, 1907, etc.\n\n\u2021 The I.O.MS. has \u201crupees.\u201d\n\n\u00a7 Blochmann, 346.\n\n|| Ulugh in MSS.\n\n\u00b6 Blochmann, 346. Y\u016bsuf died in November, 1601. His eldest son was M. Lashkar\u012b.\nall these troubles of yours will disappear.\u201d Indeed, when I in one day diminished (the quantity I took of) both of them, there was a great gain on that first day. On *Mub\u0101rak-shamba* (Thursday), the 3rd Kh\u016brd\u0101d, Qizilb\u0101sh K. was promoted to the mans\u0101b, original and increased, of 1,500 personal and 1,200 horse. A report was received from Gajpat K., superintendent of the elephant stables, and Bal\u016bch K., chief huntsman (*Qar\u0101wul Beg*), that up to this time sixty-nine elephants, male and female, had been caught. Whatever took place after this would be reported. I ordered them to beware not to take old or small elephants; but with this exception they should catch all they saw, male or female. On Monday, the 14th,* the sum of Rs. 2,000 was presented for Sh\u0101h \u2018\u0100lam\u2019s anniversary, to Sayyid Mu\u1e25ammad, his representative. A special Kachh horse, one of the good horses of the J\u0101m which had been presented to me, was given to R\u0101ja B\u012br Singh Deo. I made a present of Rs. 1,000 to Bal\u016bch K., the chief huntsman, who is engaged in capturing elephants. On Tuesday, 15th, I found I had a severe headache, which at last ended in fever. At night I did not drink my usual number of cups, and after midnight crop-sickness\u2020 was added to my fever, and till morning I rolled about on my couch. On Wednesday, the 16th, at the end of the day, the fever diminished, and, after asking the advice of my doctors, I took my usual number of cups on the third night. Although they urged me to take some broth of pulse and rice, I could not make up my mind to do so. Since I arrived at the age of discretion, I never remember having taken *b\u016bgh\u0101n\u2021* broth, and hope that I may not want it in future. When they brought food for me this day, I had no inclination for it. In short, for three days and two\n\n---\n\n* The MSS. have 24th and 25th for the following day, but 14th and 15th seem right.\n\n\u2020 The passage is translated in Elliot, vi. 357, but the mention of Saturday and of Multan doctors there is a mistake. Text has *afz\u016bdam*, \u201cI increased my intoxication,\u201d but this seems wrong. The MSS. have *afz\u016bd*. Jah\u0101ngir means that the stoppage of his wine increased crapulousness. See Elliot, vi. 357.\n\n\u2021 Apparently this should be *y\u016bgh\u0101n*, which is a Turki word meaning \u201cthick.\u201d\nnights I remained fasting. Though I had fever for a day and a night, and my weakness was such that it appeared as if I had been confined to bed for a long time, I had no appetite left, and had no inclination towards food.\n\nI* am amazed to think what pleasure or goodness the founder of this city could have seen in a spot so devoid of the favour (of God) as to build a city on it. After him, others, too, have passed their lives in precious trouble in this dust-bin. Its air is poisonous, and its soil has little water, and is of sand and dust, as has already\u2020 been described. Its water is very bad and unpalatable, and the river, which is by the side of the city, is always dry except in the rainy season. Its wells are mostly salt and bitter, and the tanks in the neighbourhood of the city have become like buttermilk from washermen\u2019s soap. The upper classes who have some property have made reservoirs in their houses, which they fill with rainwater in the rainy season, and they drink that water until the next year. The evils of water to which the air never penetrates, and which has no way for the vapour to come out by, are evident. Outside the city, in place of green grass and flowers, all is an open plain full of thorn-brakes (zaqq\u016bm), and as for the breeze that blows off the thorns, its excellence is known:\n\n\u201c\u2021 O thou, compendium of goodness, by which of thy names shall I call thee?\n\nI had already called \u0100hm\u0101d\u0101b\u0101d Gard\u0101b\u0101d (the abode of dust).\u201d\n\nNow, I do not know whether to call it Sam\u016bmist\u0101n (the place of the sam\u016bm or simoom) or B\u012bm\u0101rist\u0101n (abode of sickness), or Zaqq\u016bm-z\u0101r (the thorn-bed), or Jahannam\u0101b\u0101d (the house of Hell), for it contains all these varieties. If the rainy season had not prevented me, I would not have delayed one day in this abode of trouble, but, like Solomon, would have seated myself on the throne of the wind, and hastened out, and released the people of God from this pain and trouble. As the men of this city are exceedingly weak-hearted and wretched, in order to guard against any of the men from the camp entering their houses with a view to oppress them, or\n\n* Elliot, vi. 358. \u2020 See Vol. I., p. 414. \u2021 The Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 115, has a different reading of this line.\ninterfering with the affairs of the poor and miserable: and lest the Q\u0101z\u012b and M\u012br \u2018Adl (judge) should, from fear of the face of men (r\u016b-d\u012bd\u0101g\u012b), temporize and not stop such oppression, I, from the date on which I entered the city, notwithstanding the heat of the air, every day, after completing the midday prayer, went and sat in the Jharoka. It was towards the river, and had no impediment in the shape of gate, or wall, or watchmen (yas\u0101wul), or chobd\u0101rs (mace-bearers). For the sake of administering justice, I sate there for two or three sidereal hours and listened to the cries for redress, and ordered punishments on the oppressors according to their faults and crimes. Even in the time of weakness I have gone every day to the jharoka, though in great pain and sorrow, according to my fixed custom, and have looked on ease of body as something unlawful* (\u1e25ar\u0101m) for me.\n\n\u201cFor the care of the people of God\nAt night I make not mine eyes acquainted with sleep;\nFor the ease of the bodies of all\nI approve of pain for my own body.\u201d\n\nBy the grace of Allah, it has become my habit not to surrender the nycthemeron, for more than two or three sidereal hours of the coin of Time, to the plundering of sleep. In this there are two advantages\u2014one, the knowledge of the kingdom; the other, wakefulness of heart in calling God to mind. God forbid that this life of a few days should pass in carelessness. As a heavy sleep is in front, I must reckon as a gain this time of my wakefulness, which I shall not see again in sleep, and must not be careless of recollecting God for a single wink.\n\n\u201cBe wakeful, for a wondrous\u2020 sleep is ahead.\u201d On the same day that I contracted fever, my son Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n, who is close to my heart, also contracted it. His attack lasted a long time, and for ten days he could not come to pay his respects. He came on Thursday, the 24th, and waited on me, and appeared very weak and powerless, so much so that if anyone had not explained the matter, one might have supposed he had been ill for a month or more. I am grateful that at last all ended\n\n* It should be recorded to Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s credit that he has a reputation even at the present day for his love of justice.\n\u2020 \u2018ajab\u012b. The MSS. have \u2018ajs\u012b, \u201clasting,\u201d which seems better.\nwell. On Thursday, the 31st, M\u012br Jumla, who had come from \u012ar\u0101n\u2014a summary of what had happened to him has been already written\u2014was honoured with the mansab of 1,500 personal and 200 horse. On this day, in consequence of the weakness I suffered from, I bestowed as alms on deserving people an elephant, a horse, and varieties of quadrupeds, with a quantity of gold and silver and other valuable things. Most of my servants also brought alms according to their means. I told them that if their object was to parade their loyalty, their proceeding was not acceptable, and if they were acting from genuine piety there was no need for bringing their alms into the Presence; they could secretly and personally distribute them to the poor and needy. On Mub\u0101rak-shamba (Thursday), the 7th T\u012br, Divine month, \u0160\u0101diq K. Bakhsh\u012b was promoted to the mansab of 2,000 personal and horse, original and increased; Ir\u0101dat K., the M\u012br S\u0101m\u0101n, to that of 2,000 and 1,000 horse, M\u012br Ab\u016b \u0160\u0101li\u1e25 R\u012bzaw\u012b to the mansab of 2,000 and 1,000 horse, with the title of R\u012bzaw\u012b Kh\u0101n, and, being honoured with a standard and an elephant, he took leave for the Deccan.\n\nAt this time it was represented to me that the Commander-in-Chief, the \u0100t\u0101liq Kh\u0101n-kh\u0101n\u0101n, as a sequel to the celebrated line, \u201cFor every rose one must bear the pain of a hundred thorns,\u201d had written an ode, and that M\u012brz\u0101 Rustam \u0160af\u0101w\u012b and M\u012brz\u0101 Mur\u0101d, his son, had also tried their skill. An impromptu opening couplet came into my mind:\n\n\u201cA cup of wine should be poured* on the cheek of the rosebed. There are many clouds, much wine should be poured.\u201d\n\nOf those who were present at the entertainment who had the poetic temperament each composed an ode, and presented it. It became known that the hemistich was from Maul\u0101n\u0101 \u2018Abdu-r-Ra\u1e25m\u0101n J\u0101m\u012b. I looked at the whole of his ode (or odes). Except this hemistich, which like a proverb has become famous over the world, he has not written anything\n\n* Compare Elliot, vi. 359. Rukh-i-gulz\u0101r also means the cheek of the rosebud (i.e., the beloved one). Apparently the conceit is that the cheek of the fair one is clouded over, so it should be reddened by pouring wine on it.\nepigrammatic. All is very simple and smooth.* On this day arrived the news of the death of Ahmad Beg K., governor of Kashmir. His sons, who were of the house-born ones of the Court, and on whose foreheads the signs of intelligence and zeal were manifest, obtained suitable mansabs, and were sent to do duty in the \u1e62uba of Bangash and Kabul. His mansab was that of 2,500; his eldest son obtained that of 3,000 (?),\u2020 and three other sons that of 900 each. On Thursday, the 14th, Khw\u0101ja B\u0101q\u012b K., who was adorned with the high qualities of dignity, honour, generosity, and valour, under whose rule was one of the th\u0101nas of the country of Ber\u0101r, was promoted to the mansab of 1,500 and 1,000 horse, original and increased, and the title of B\u0101q\u012b K. R\u0101y Kahn\u016br (Kunwar ?), who was formerly D\u012bw\u0101n of Gujarat, was chosen for the d\u012bw\u0101nship of M\u0101lwa.\n\nAt this time the pairing of the s\u0101ras, which I had never seen before, and is reported never to have been seen by man, was witnessed by me. The s\u0101ras is a creature of the crane genus, but somewhat larger.\u00a7 On the top of the head it has no feathers, and the skin is drawn over the bones of the head. From the back of the eye to six finger-breadths of the neck it is red. They mostly live in pairs on the plains, but are occasionally seen in flocks. People bring a pair in from the fields, and keep them in their houses, and they become familiar with men. In fact, there was a pair of s\u0101ras in my establishment to which I had given the names of Lail\u0101 and Majn\u016bn. One day a eunuch informed me that (the) two had paired in his presence. I ordered that if they showed an inclination to pair again they should inform me. At dawn he came and told me that they were about to pair again. I immediately hastened to look on. The female having straightened its legs bent down a little: the male then lifted up one of its feet from the ground and placed it on her back, and afterwards the\n\n* hamw\u0101r. Perhaps it means \u201cmediocre\u201d here, but we have the word a little lower down, p. 240, used in a laudatory sense.\n\n\u2020 According to the Ma'\u0101\u0161ir and Blochmann, 465, it was the second son who attained the highest rank.\n\n\u2021 dah duwizdah, \u201c10, 12\u201d\u2014i.e., it is one-fifth larger. The s\u0101ras is the Ardea Antigone of naturalists.\nsecond foot, and, immediately seating himself on her back, paired with her. He then came down, and, stretching out his neck, put his beak to the ground, and walked once round the female. It is possible they may have an egg and produce a young one. Many strange tales of the affection of the s\u0101ras for its mate have been heard. The following case has been recorded because it is very strange. Qiy\u0101m K., who is one of the kh\u0101naz\u0101ds (houseborn ones) of this Court, and is well acquainted with the arts of hunting and scouting, informed me that one day he had gone out to hunt, and found a s\u0101ras sitting. When he approached, it got up and went off. From its manner of walking he perceived signs of weakness and pain. He went to the place where it had been sitting, and saw some bones and a handful of feathers on which it had been sitting. He threw a net round it, and drew himself into a corner, and it tried to go and sit in the same place. Its foot was caught in the net, and he went forward and seized it. It appeared extremely light, and when he looked minutely he saw there were no feathers on its breast and belly: its flesh and skin had separated, and there were maggots. Moreover, there was no sign of flesh left on any of its members: a handful of feathers and bone came into his hand. It was clear that its mate had died, and that it had sate there from the day it lost its companion.\n\n\"My burning heart hath melted my body with separation's pang;\nA soul-consuming sigh burnt me, as 'twere a lamp.\nThe day of my joy became black like the night of grief,\nSeparation from thee hath made my day like this.\"\n\nHimmat K., who is one of my best servants, and whose word is worthy of reliance, told me that in the Doh\u0101d* pargana he had seen a pair of s\u0101ras on the bank of a tank. One of his gunners shot one of them, and in the same place cut off its head and stripped\u2020 it of its feathers (?). By chance we halted\n\n* Two boundaries. The name signifies that it is on the borders of M\u0101lwa and Gujaru, I. G. XI. 366.\n\u2020 p\u0101k s\u0101kht.

Probably the gunner left the body or part of it there, and it was this that the male circumambulated.\ntwo or three days at that place, and its mate continually walked round it, and uttered cries and lamentation. \"My heart,\" he said, \"ached at its distress, but there was no remedy for it save regret.\" By chance, twenty-five days afterwards, he passed by the same spot, and asked the inhabitants what had become of that s\u0101ras. They said it died on the same day, and there were still remains of feathers and bones on the spot. He went there himself, and saw it was as they said. There are many tales of this kind among the people, which it would take too long to tell.\n\nOn Saturday, the 16th, there came the news of the death of R\u0101wat Shankar, who was one of those on duty in Bih\u0101r. M\u0101n Singh, his eldest son, was raised to the man\u1e63ab of 2,000 personal and 600 horse: his other sons and connections were also raised in man\u1e63ab, and were directed to obey him. On Thursday, the 21st, the elephant B\u0101van,* the pick of my catch, which had been left in the pargana of Dohad to be tamed, was brought to Court. I ordered him to be kept near the jharoka on the river side, that he might be constantly under my eye. In the elephant-stables of H.M. Akbar the largest elephant I saw was Durjan S\u0101l. It was long the premier elephant. Its height was 4 yards (dara\u2020), and 3\u00bd quarters of the Il\u0101h\u012b gaz, which is 8 yards and 3 fingers of the ordinary gaz. At present, among the elephants of my establishment, the largest athlete is \u2018\u0100lam-Gajraj, which H.M. Akbar himself had caught. It is the chief of my special elephants. Its height is 4\u00bd yards, or 7 yards and 7 fingers\u2021 of the ordinary yard. The ordinary gaz has been fixed at 24 fingers\u2019 breadth of an average-sized man, and the Il\u0101h\u012b gaz is 40 fingers\u2019 breadth.\n\nOn this day Mu\u1e93affar K., who had been promoted to the Subadarship of Thatta (Sind), had the good fortune to kiss the threshold.

At this time news came that God Almighty had bestowed on my son Parwiz a son* by the daughter of Sh\u0101h Mur\u0101d, deceased. It is to be hoped that his coming will be of good omen to this State.\n\nOn Sunday, the 24th, R\u0101y Bih\u0101r\u012b\u2020 had the good fortune to kiss the threshold: there is not a greater Zamindar than this in the country of Gujarat. His country is close to the sea. Bih\u0101r\u012b and the J\u0101m are from one stem. They were united ten generations ago. As far as territory and forces go, the standing of Bih\u0101r\u012b is greater than that of the J\u0101m. They say that he never came to see any of the Sultans of Gujarat. Sult\u0101n Ma\u1e25m\u016bd had sent an army against him, but in the fight the army of Ma\u1e25m\u016bd was defeated. At the time when Kh\u0101n A\u02bf\u1e93am went to conquer the fort of J\u016bn\u0101garh in the country of S\u016brat, Nann\u016b, who was called Sult\u0101n Mu\u1e93affar, and gave himself out as heir to the kingdom, was passing his days in a state of misery under the protection of the zamindars. After this the J\u0101m was defeated in battle with the victorious (Royal) army, and Nann\u016b took refuge with R\u0101y Bih\u0101r\u012b. Kh\u0101n A\u02bf\u1e93am demanded Nann\u016b from R\u0101y Bih\u0101r\u012b, and as he could not oppose the Royal army, he gave him up, and by this piece of loyalty was saved from the blows of the victorious army. At the time\u2021 when Ahmadabad was adorned by the presence of the retinue of fortune for a short time, he did not come to wait on me. His country was somewhat distant, and time did not admit of the appointing of a force (against him). When it happened that I returned there, my son Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n appointed Raja Bikram\u0101j\u012bt with an army (for this purpose), and he, seeing his own safety in coming in hastened to receive the honour of kissing the threshold, giving 200 muhars and\n\n* This was not the son who died in the following year.

See Jarrett, ii. 250, where it is said that the J\u0101m left his original country 60 years ago.\n\n\u2021 Jah\u0101ng\u012br is referring to his visit to Gujarat in the 12th year of his reign.\nRs. 2,000 as nazr, and 100 horses. However, there was not one of his horses that I approved of. His age appeared to me to be more than eighty* years, and he himself said he was ninety. In his senses and powers there was no appearance of decay. Among his men there was an old man with white beard, moustaches, and eyebrows. He said that R\u0101y Bih\u0101r\u012b remembered him when he (the old man) was a child (infant), and that he had grown up from childhood in his service.\n\nOn this day Ab\u016b-l-\u1e24asan,\u2020 the painter, who has been honoured with the title of N\u0101diru-z-zam\u0101n, drew the picture of my accession as the frontispiece to the Jah\u0101ng\u012br-n\u0101ma, and brought it to me. As it was worthy of all praise, he received endless favours. His work was perfect, and his picture is one of the chefs d\u2019\u0153uvre of the age. At the present time he has no rival or equal. If at this day the masters \u2018Abdu-l-Hayy and Bihz\u0101d were alive, they would have done him justice. His father, \u0100q\u0101 Riz\u0101\u2019\u012b, of Herat,\u2021 at the time when I was Prince, joined my service. He (Ab\u016b-l-\u1e24asan) was a kh\u0101naz\u0101d of my Court. There is, however, no comparison between his work and that of his father (i.e., he is far better than his father). One cannot put them into the same category. My connection was based on my having reared him. From his earliest years up to the present time I have always looked after him, till his art has arrived at this rank. Truly he has become N\u0101dira-i-zam\u0101n (\u201cthe wonder of the age\u201d). Also, Ust\u0101d Man\u1e63\u016br\u00a7 has become such a master in painting that he has the title of N\u0101diru-l-\u2018A\u1e63r, and in the art of drawing is unique in his generation. In the time of my father\u2019s reign and my own these two have had no third. As regards myself, my liking for painting and my practice in judging it have arrived at such a point that when any work is brought before me, either of deceased artists or of those of the present day, without the names being told me, I say on the spur of the moment that it is the work of such and such a man. And if there be a\n\n* MSS. have this 70 or 80. \u2020 Elliot, vi. 359.\n\u2021 Text \u201cof Merv,\u201d but the MSS. have Herat.\n\u00a7 Mans\u016br Naqq\u0101sh is one of the illustrators to the B\u0101bar-n\u0101ma in the British Museum.

If any other person has put in the eye and eyebrow of a face, I can perceive whose work the original face is, and who has painted the eye and eyebrows.\n\nOn the eve of Sunday, the 31st of the month of T\u012br, heavy rain fell, and it went on raining with great violence till Tuesday, the 1st of Amurd\u0101d.* For sixteen days there were constantly clouds and (? or) rain. As this is a sandy country, and the buildings in it are weak, many houses fell, and many lives were lost. I heard from the inhabitants of the city that they remembered no rain like that of this year. Although the channel of the S\u0101barmat\u012b\u2020 appears full of water, it is in most places fordable, and elephants can always cross it. If for a day there has been no rain, horses and men can ford it. The fountain head of this river is in the hill-country of the R\u0101n\u0101. It comes out from the ravine of Kokra(?),\u2021 and, having traversed $1\\frac{1}{2}$ koss, passes below M\u012brp\u016br.\u00a7 and in this place they call it the W\u0101kal (?). After passing 3 koss beyond M\u012brp\u016br, they call it the S\u0101barmat\u012b.\n\nOn Thursday, the 10th, R\u0101y Bih\u0101r\u012b was exalted with the favour of a male and a female elephant, a jewelled dagger, and four rings, of red ruby and yellow ruby (topaz), sapphire, and emerald. Before this, the \u0100t\u0101liq J\u0101n-sip\u0101r (life-jeoparding), Kh\u0101n-kh\u0101n\u0101n (\u2018Abdu-r-Rah\u012bm), Commander-in-Chief, by order, had sent a force under the leadership of his son Amru-l-lah|| towards Gondw\u0101na, in order to seize the diamond mine of Bar\u0101kar\u00b6 (?) that was in the possession of Panj\u016b, a Zamindar of Khandesh. On this day a report came from him that the aforesaid Zamindar, knowing that opposition to the victorious army was beyond his power, had made an offering of the mine,\n\n* Apparently there were 32 days in this T\u012br.\n\u2020 The S\u0101barmat\u012b rises in the hills of Mew\u0101r.\n\u2021 I cannot find this Kokra or Gogra. The S\u0101barmat\u012b falls into the Gulf of Cambay. Possibly Kokra thereby means \u201cmountains.\u201d\n\u00a7 Apparently the Mairp\u016br of Bayley\u2019s map. || Blochmann, 339.\n\u00b6 Perhaps this is the B\u012br\u0101gam of the \u0100\u02be\u012bn A.

The word Bar\u0101kar is omitted in text.\nand a royal superintendent had been appointed to manage it. The diamonds of that place are superior in kind and beauty to all other kinds of diamonds, and much esteemed by jewellers. They are of good shape, and larger, and superior. Of the second rank is the mine of Kokhra,* which is on the borders of Bihar; but the diamonds of that place are not obtained from the mine, but from a river which in the rainy season comes down in flood from the hills. Before that they dam it up, and when the flood has passed over the dam and there is little water, a number of men who are skilled in this art go into the river bed and bring out the diamonds. It is now three years since this country came into the possession of the State. The Zamindar of the place is in confinement. The climate of that land is excessively poisonous, and strangers cannot live there. The third place is in the province of the Karnatik (Carnatic), near the frontier of Qu\u1e6dbu-l-mulk. At a distance of 50 koss\u2020 there are four mines. Many very fine\u2021 diamonds are obtained there.\n\nOn Thursday, the 10th, N\u0101hir K. was promoted to the mansab of 1,500 personal and 1,000 horse, and he was presented with an elephant. Makt\u016bb K., superintendent of the Kutub-kh\u0101na (library), was given the mansab of 1,500 personal. As I had ordered that on the Shab-i-Bar\u0101t they should place lamps round the K\u0101nkriya tank, at the end of the day on Monday, the 14th Sha\u02bfb\u0101n, I went out to look at them. The buildings all round the tank they had arranged with lanterns of different colours and all kinds of artifices that are practicable with lamps, and fireworks. Although at this season there were continually clouds and rain, by God\u2019s favour from the beginning of the night the air had become clear, and not a trace of cloud remained, and the lights shone just as one could wish. My domestic servants were regaled with the cups of\n\n* See Blochmann, 480 n., Elliot, vi. 344, and the T\u016bzuk, annals of 10th year.\n\n\u2020 Probably the meaning is that the four mines occur within a space of 50 koss. Tavernier, vol. ii., may be consulted.\n\n\u2021 Puhkta in text, but the MSS. have not this word. Instead, they have a word which seems to be ta\u1e25sina, \u201cbeautiful.\u201d The R.A.S. MS. also seems to have ta\u1e25sina.\njoy. I ordered them to light lamps in the same manner on the eve of Friday, and a strange thing was that at the close of the day of Thursday, the 17th, it continually rained (mutta\u1e63il b\u0101r\u012bdagi), but at the time of lighting the lamps the rain ceased, and the show was well seen. On this day I\u2019tim\u0101du-d-daula presented an offering of a qu\u1e6db\u012b (?) sapphire exceedingly delicate, and an elephant without tusks with silver housings. As it was handsome-looking and of good shape, it was put among my private elephants. On the bank of the K\u0101nkriya tank a sany\u0101s\u012b, one of the most austere sects of Hindus, had made a hut after the dervish manner, and lived as a hermit. As I was always inclined to associate with dervishes, I hastened without ceremony to interview him, and for a while enjoyed his society. He was not wanting in information and reasonableness, and was well informed according to the rules of his own faith in the doctrines of Sufism. He had conformed to the ways of people of religious poverty and mortification, and given up all desires and ambitions. One might say that a better than he of his class was never seen.\n\nOn Monday, the 21st (Amurd\u0101d), the s\u0101ras, the pairing of which has been related in the preceding pages, collected together some straw and rubbish in the little garden, and laid first of all one egg. On the third day (afterwards) it laid a second egg. This pair of s\u0101ras were caught when they were a month old,* and had been in my establishment for five years. After five and a half years they paired, and continued doing so for a month; on the 21st of the month of Amurd\u0101d, which the Hindus call S\u0101wan (Sr\u0101van) the hen laid the eggs. The female used to sit on the eggs the whole night alone, and the male stood near her on guard. It was so alert that it was impossible for any living thing to pass near her. Once a large weasel made its appearance, and he ran at it with the greatest impetuosity, and did not stop until the weasel got into a hole. When the sun illuminated the world with his rays, the male went to the female and pecked her back with his beak. The female then rose, and the male sate in her place.\n\n* m\u0101hag\u012b? Probably it means that they were caught when a month old, and Elliot\u2019s translator so took it.\nShe returned, and in the same manner made him rise, and seated herself. In short, the female sits the whole night, and takes care of the eggs, and by day the male and female sit by turns. When they rise and sit down they take great precautions that no harm shall come to the eggs.\n\nDuring this season, as there was still some of the hunting time left, Gajpat K., the darogha, and Bal\u016bch K., the head huntsman, had been left to hunt elephants, to catch as many as they possibly could. In the same manner the huntsmen of my son, Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n, had also been employed. On this day they came and waited on me. Altogether 185 elephants had been caught, male and female: of these, 73 were males and 112 females. Out of these, 47 males and 75 females, or 122, the imperial huntsmen and faujdars had secured, while the huntsmen and elephant-drivers of my son, Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n, had taken 26 males and 37 females, or 63 altogether.\n\nOn Thursday, the 24th, I went to see the B\u0101gh-i-Fath,* and spent two days there in enjoyment and pleasure. At the end of the day on Saturday I returned to the palace. As \u0100\u1e63af K. had represented that his haw\u012b\u1e6di (house) garden was exceedingly green and pleasant, and all sorts of flowers and scented plants had bloomed there, at his request I went to it on Mub\u0101rak-shamba (Thursday), the 31st. In truth, it was a very nice villa, and I was much pleased. His offering of jewels and jewelled things, and cloth, of the value of Rs. 35,000, was accepted. Mu\u1e93affar K. was favoured with a dress of honour and an elephant, and, as before, was entrusted with the charge of the government of Thatta (Sind). My brother Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s sent a letter with some trifling presents by \u2018Abdu-l-Kar\u012bm of Gil\u0101n, who had come with merchandise from \u012ar\u0101n. On this day I presented him with a dress of honour and an elephant, and gave him leave to return, and sent an answer to the Shah\u2019s letter with a memorandum. Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam was also honoured with a gracious farman and a special dress of honour. Friday was the 1st of the month of Shahr\u012bwar.\n\n* This was the garden which \u2018Abdu-r-Ra\u1e25\u012bm made after his victory over Mu\u1e93affar Gujar\u0101t\u012b. In Price\u2019s Jah\u0101ng\u012br, pp. 115-16, there is an account of an entertainment given there to Jah\u0101ng\u012br by \u2018Abdu-r-Ra\u1e25\u012bm\u2019s daughter.\nFrom Sunday, the 3rd, till the eve of Thursday (the 7th) rain fell. It is strange that on other days the pair of s\u0101ras sate on the eggs five or six times in turn, but during this twenty-four hours, when there was constant rain and the air was somewhat cold, the male, in order to keep the eggs warm, sate from early in the morning until midday, and from that time until the next morning the female sat without an interval, for fear that in rising and sitting again the cold air should affect them, and the eggs become wet and be spoilt. Briefly, men are led by the guidance of Reason, and animals according to the Divine wisdom implanted in them by Nature. Stranger still is it that at first they keep their eggs together underneath the breast, and after fourteen or fifteen days have passed they leave a little space between them, for fear the heat should become too great from their contact with each other. Many become addled in consequence of (too great) heat.\n\nOn Thursday, the 7th, with great joy and congratulation, the advance camp was started towards Agra. The astrologers and astronomers had already fixed the auspicious hour for the march. As excessive rain fell, the main camp could not cross the river of Mahm\u016bd\u0101b\u0101d (the V\u0101trak) and the Mah\u012b at this hour. Out of necessity, the advanced camp was started at the appointed hour, and the 21st Shahr\u012bwar* was fixed for the march of the main camp.\n\nMy son Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n took upon himself the responsibility of the conquest of the fort of K\u0101ngra, over which the noose of victory had not been thrown by any of the Sultans of lofty dignity, and an army under the leadership of R\u0101ja S\u016braj Mal, s. R\u0101ja B\u0101so, and Taq\u012b, who was one of his attached servants, had before this been sent for that purpose. It was now clear that the conquest could not be achieved by the force that had been previously appointed. R\u0101ja Bikram\u0101jit,\u2020 who was one of his principal officers, with 2,000 horse who were present of his private attendants, and a force of Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b servants, such as Sh\u0101h-b\u0101z K. Lod\u012b, Hard\u012b Nar\u0101yan H\u0101da, R\u0101y Prith\u012b Chand, and the sons of R\u0101m Chand, with 200 mounted musketeers and 500 foot-musketeers (topch\u012b, perhaps cannoniers),\n\n* Or 22 Ramaz\u0101n, 1027 = September 2, 1618. \u2020 Cf. Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 117.\nin addition to the force that had previously been sent, were appointed to the duty. As the hour for departure was fixed on this day, the aforesaid (Bikram\u0101j\u012bt) presented as an offering a rosary of emeralds of the value of Rs. 10,000. He was honoured with the gift of a dress of honour and a sword, and took his leave for this duty. As he had not a jagir in that Subah, my son Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n asked for him as a jagir the pargana of Barh\u0101na (?),* the revenue of which was 2,200,000 of dams, which\u2020 he himself (?) Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n) held in in\u2018\u0101m.\u00a7 Khw\u0101ja Taq\u012b, the D\u012bw\u0101n-i-Buy\u016bt\u0101t, who had been appointed to the D\u012bw\u0101n\u012b of the Deccan, was honoured with the title of Mu\u2018taqid\u00a7 K., a dress of honour, and an elephant. I appointed Himmat K. to the faujdarship of the Sarkar of Bhar\u016bch (Broach) and that neighbourhood, with the gift of a horse and a special parm narm (shawl), and despatched him. The pargana of Bhar\u016bch (Broach) was also bestowed on him as jagir. R\u0101y Prith\u012b Chand, who had been nominated for service at K\u0101ngra, was promoted to the rank of 700 and 450 horse. As the anniversary of Shaikh Mu\u1e25ammad Ghau\u1e63|| had arrived, I gave his sons 1,000 darbs (Rs. 500) for its expense. Mu\u1e93affar, s. Bah\u0101duru-l-mulk, who was attached to the Deccan, was given the man\u0161\u0101b of 1,000 personal and 500 horse.\n\nAs the events of twelve years of Jah\u0101ng\u012br-n\u0101ma have been recorded, I ordered\u00b6 the clerks of my private library to make one volume of these twelve years, and to prepare a number of copies so that I might give them to my special servants, and\n\n* In MSS. written Marh\u0101na or Sarh\u0101na.

I presume the meaning is that Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n asked that this pargana should be given to Bikram\u0101j\u012bt as a favour to himself. But perhaps the meaning is \u201cwhich he (Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n) had asked for, for himself.\u201d\n\n\u2021 In the MSS. the word kh\u016bd follows in\u2018\u0101m instead of preceding it.

On Friday, the 8th,* one of the news-writers had written the whole and made a volume, which he produced to me. As it was the first copy that had been prepared, I gave it to my son Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n, whom I consider to be in all respects the first of my sons. On the back of it I wrote with my own hand that I had given it him on a certain day and at a certain place. I hope that the favour of the receipt of those writings which are intended for the satisfaction of the creature and for supplication to the Creator may be a cause of good fortune.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 12th, Subh\u0101n Qul\u012b, huntsman, was brought to punishment. The details of this are that he is the son of H\u0101j\u012b Jam\u0101l Bal\u016bch, who was my father\u2019s best huntsman, and after his (the King\u2019s death) he entered the service of Isl\u0101m K., and went with him to Bengal. Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n, on account of his (Subh\u0101n Qul\u012b\u2019s) connection with this Court, showed him proper consideration, and considering him trustworthy always kept him near him when travelling or hunting. \u2018U\u1e63m\u0101n, the Afghan, who for many years passed his days in that Subah in disobedience and stubbornness, and the end of whose affairs has been recorded in the preceding pages, being much troubled by Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n, sent someone to this wretch, and made proposals for his murdering Isl\u0101m. He undertook the business, and associated two or three other men with himself. By chance, before the futile idea of this ungrateful fellow was carried into execution, one of them came and informed him (Isl\u0101m K.). Isl\u0101m K. immediately seized and imprisoned the scoundrel. After the latter\u2019s death he came to Court. As his brothers and relatives were included among the huntsmen, he was also ordered to be enrolled among them. At this time the son (Ikr\u0101m K.) of Isl\u0101m K. represented in an enigmatical way that he was unworthy of service near my person. After explanation it appeared what the charge was. Notwithstanding this,\n\n* The 8th Shahriwar = August 20, 1618.

In spite of this grace and the gift of his life, without cause or motive he fled from the Court, and went to Agra and that neighbourhood. Bal\u016bch K., having become his security, was ordered to produce him. He sent people to inquire for him. In one of the villages of Agra, which was not wanting in sedition, and is called Jahanda,* the brother of Bal\u016bch Kh\u0101n, who had gone to make inquiries, found him, and although he endeavoured to bring him by persuasion to Court, he would in no way consent, and the people rose to assist him.\n\nBeing without remedy, he (the brother) went to Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n at Agra, and told him the circumstances. He sent a detachment against that village to take him by force and bring him. The people of the village, seeing their own ruin in the mirror of the case, handed him over to him. This day he came to Court in chains. I gave an order for his execution. The man of wrath (the executioner) took him to the place of punishment with all haste. After a while, through the intercession of one of the courtiers, I gave him his life, and ordered his feet to be cut off, but according to his destiny (what was written on his head) before the order arrived he had been punished. Although that doomed man was deserving of punishment, yet I regretted\u2020 the circumstance, and directed that whenever an order was given for anyone's execution, notwithstanding that the command were imperative, they should wait till sunset before putting him to death. If up to that time no order for release arrived, he should without fail be capitally punished.\n\nOn Sunday there was a great commotion in the River Mah\u012b, and very large waves were visible. Although there formerly had been (great) rains, yet such violence, or even the half of it, had never been known. From the beginning of the day the flood began to come, and at the end of the day began to\n\n* So in text, but MSS. give Jahanda as the name of the brother of Bal\u016bch. \u2020 Elliot, VI. 361.\ndecrease. Old inhabitants of this city represented that once, during the government of Murta\u1e93\u0101 K. (Far\u012bd Bukh\u0101r\u012b), a similar great flood had occurred. But with that exception they did not remember another such flood.\n\nIn these days mention was made of an ode by Mu\u02bfizz\u012b,* the panegyrist of Sult\u0101n Sanjar, and his Poet-laureate. It is a very smooth and equable\u2020 composition. It begins thus:\n\n\u201cO thou whose commands heaven obeys\nAncient Saturn is the slave of thy young Fortune.\u201d\n\nSa\u02bf\u012bd\u0101,\u2021 the chief goldsmith, has a poetical temperament and he imitated this ode, and presented his paraphrase to me. It was very well composed. The following are some verses from it:\n\n\u201cO thou, of whose threshold the nine spheres are an examplar\nAged Time hath grown young in thy reign\nThy heart is bounteous as the Sun, and like it needs no cause\n(for bounty).\nAll lives are devoted to thy gracious heart\nHeaven is but a green\u00a7 orange from the garden of Power\nTossed by thy gardener into the atmosphere,\nO God, Thy essence has shone from eternity\nThe souls of all the saints receive light from Thine,\nO king, may the world ever be at thy beck,\nMay thy Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n ever rejoice in thy shade\nO Shadow of God, may the world be filled with thy light\nMay the Light of God over be thy canopy.\u201d\n\n* Text wrongly has Maghribi, who was a much later poet, for he died in 809 A.H. =1416. Sult\u0101n Sanjar belonged to the sixth century of the Hijra, and Mu\u02bfizz\u012b, who is the poet meant by Jah\u0101ng\u012br, died in 542 A.H. (1147-48), having been accidentally killed with an arrow by Sult\u0101n Sanjar. See Rieu, II. 552b. The ode quoted by Jah\u0101ng\u012br is to be found at p. 138b of British Museum MS. Add. 10588.\n\n\u2020 hamv\u0101r used here in a favourable sense, though some pages farther back; 233 of Persian text, it seems to be used, when speaking of J\u0101m\u012b, in disparagement.\n\n\u2021 See Beale art. Sa\u02bf\u012bd\u0101-i-Gil\u0101n\u012b. He was styled Bi-badal. The date 1116 in Beale is manifestly wrong. He is the Mull\u0101 Shaid\u0101 of Rieu, III., 1083e. See also Sprenger\u2019s Catalogue, 124; there is a notice of him in the Ma\u02be\u0101giru-l-Umar\u0101, I. 405. He was the artist of the Peacock-throne.\n\n\u00a7 Turunj, rendered by Vullers as \u201ccitron.\u201d Probably the reference is to the colour of the sky, which is often spoken of by Orientals as green. The concluding lines play upon Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s title of N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn, on his son\u2019s title of Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n, and his name of Khurr\u0101m.\nOn Mub\u0101rak-shamba, the 14th, in reward for this ode, I ordered Sa\u02bfid\u0101 to be weighed against money (zar, perhaps gold). At the end of the day I went to walk about the garden of Rustam-b\u0101r\u012b,* which appeared to me very green and pleasant. Sitting in a boat in the evening, I returned to the palace.\n\nOn Friday, the 15th, a Mull\u0101 of the name of Am\u012br\u012b, an old man, came from M\u0101-war\u0101\u02bea-n-nahr (Transoxiana), and had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. He represented to me that he was one of the ancient (servants) of \u2018Abdu-llah Kh\u0101n Uzbeg, and from the days of infancy\u2020 and youth was brought up by the Kh\u0101n until his death. He had been included among his old servants, and had been a confidential friend.\u2021 After the death of the Kh\u0101n until now he had passed his days respected in that country. He had left his native country with a view to visit the blessed house (Mecca), and had come to pay his respects to me. I made him free to remain or go. He asked to remain in attendance on me for some days. Rs. 1,000 for expenses and a dress of honour were given him. He is an old man of very pleasing face, and full of talk and anecdote. My son Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n also gave him Rs. 500 and a robe of honour.\n\nIn the middle of the garden of Khurram (Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n\u2019s) residence there is a bench and a reservoir. On one side\u00a7 of that bench there is a M\u016blsar\u012b-tree (Mimusops elengi) against which to lean the back. As in one side of its trunk there was a hollow to the extent of three-fourths of a yard, it had an ugly look. I ordered them to cut a tablet of marble and fix it firmly in that place, so that one could lean one\u2019s back on it and sit there. At this time an impromptu couplet came to my tongue, and I ordered the stone-cutters to engrave it\n\n* B\u0101r\u012b is a Hindu word meaning garden.\n\u2020 ayy\u0101m-i-jaw\u0101n\u012b.

MSS. have B\u016blsar\u012b, for which see Blochmann, 70. Apparently there was only one tree.\non that stone, that it might remain as a memento on the page of time. This is the couplet:\n\n\"The seat of the Sh\u0101h of the seven worlds (kishwar),\nJah\u0101ng\u012br, son of Akbar Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h.\"\n\nOn the eve of Tuesday,* the 19th, a bazaar was arranged in the private palace. Up to this time the custom has been for the people of the bazaar and the artificers of the city in every place to bring their shops according to order into the courtyard of the palace (royal abode, whether in camp or elsewhere), and bring jewels and jewelled things and various kinds of cloth and other goods such as are sold in the bazaar. It occurred to me that if a bazaar were prepared in the night-time, and a number of lamps were arranged in front of the shops, it would look well. Undoubtedly it came off well and was unusual. Going round all the shops, whatever jewels and jewelled things pleased me I bought. I gave some present from each shop to Mull\u0101 Am\u012br\u012b, and he received so many things that he was unable to hold them.\n\nOn Mub\u0101rak-\u0161amba (Thursday) the 21st of the Divine month of Shahriwar, in the thirteenth year from my accession, corresponding with the 22nd Ramaz\u0101n (September 2, 1618), in the Hijr\u012b year 1027, when two and a half hours of day had passed, in prosperity and happiness, the standards of purpose turned towards the capital of Agra. From the palace as far as the K\u0101nkriya tank, the place of alighting, I passed along in the usual manner, scattering money (ni\u1e63\u0101r-kun\u0101n). On the same day the feast of my solar weighment took place, and according to solar reckoning the fiftieth year of the age of his suppliant at the throne of God commenced auspiciously. According to my usual rule I weighed myself against gold and other valuables. I scattered pearls and golden roses, and looking at night at the show of lamps passed my time in the private apartments of the royal abode in enjoyment. On Friday, the 22nd, I ordered that all the Shaikhs and men of piety who lived in the city should be brought in order that they might break their fast\u2020 in attendance on me. Three\n\n* Elliot, VI. 361.\n\u2020 This was not the \u2018\u012ad, for the month was not over. It was the feasting after nightfall usual in the Ramaz\u0101n.\nnights were passed after this manner, and every night at the end of the meeting I stood up and recited with the tongue of ecstasy:\n\n\"Thou art the mighty One, O Lord,\nThou art the cherisher of rich and poor;\nI'm not a world-conqueror or law-giver,\nI'm one of the beggars at this gate.\nHelp me in what is good and right,\nElse what good comes from me to any one?\nI'm a master* to my servants,\nTo the Lord I'm a loyal servant.\"\n\nAll the Faqirs who as yet had not waited on me prayed for allowances. According to their merits I gave to each of them land or money for expenses, and gratified them.\n\nOn the eve of Mub\u0101rak-shamba (Thursday) the 21st, the s\u0101ras hatched one young one, and on the eve of Monday, the 25th, a second: that is, one young one was hatched after thirty-four\u2020 days, and the other after thirty-six days. One might say that they were one-tenth\u2021 larger than the young of a goose, or equal to the young of the peafowl at the age of a month. Their skin was of a blue colour. On the first day they ate nothing, and from the second day the mother, taking small locusts (or grasshoppers) in her mouth, sometimes fed them like a pigeon, or sometimes like a fowl threw them before them for them to pick up of themselves. If the locust were small, it went off well, but if it were large, she sometimes made two or three pieces of it so that the young ones might eat it with ease. As I had a great liking for seeing them I ordered them to be brought before me with every precaution that no harm might happen to them. After I had seen them I ordered them to be taken back to the same little garden inside\n\n* khud\u0101vandi-g\u0101r. For which word see Vullers and the Bah\u0101r-i-\u2018Ajam. Perhaps it means here a locum-tenens or officiating master.\n\n\u2020 Apparently this should be thirty-two. The egg was laid on 21 Amurd\u0101d, see p. 237, and the interval between the hatching of the two chicks was three or four days.\n\n\u2021 Text dah y\u0101zdah, ten to eleven. But MS. 305 has dah p\u0101nzdah, ten to fifteen, which is more likely. The meaning then would be that the young of the s\u0101ras were 50 per cent., or one-half larger than goslings. The common expression for one-tenth is dah yak.\nthe royal enclosure, and to be preserved with the greatest care, and that they should be brought to me again whenever they were able to walk.\n\nOn this day Hak\u012bm R\u016b\u1e25u-llah was exalted with the gift of Rs. 1,000. B\u0101di\u02bfu-z-zam\u0101n, s. M. Sh\u0101hrukh, came from his jagir and waited on me. On Tuesday, the 26th, marching from the K\u0101nkriya tank, I halted at the village of Kaj.* On Wednesday, the 27th, I pitched my camp on the bank of the river at Mahm\u016bd\u0101b\u0101d called the \u012azak\u2020 (now called Meshva). As the water and air of Ahm\u0101d\u0101b\u0101d were very bad, Mahm\u016bd B\u012bgara, by the advice of his physicians, founded a city on the bank of the aforesaid river and lived there. After he conquered Ch\u0101mp\u0101ner, he made that place his capital, and until the time of Mahm\u016bd the martyred\u2021 the rulers of Gujarat chiefly lived there. This Mahm\u016bd was the last of the Sultans of Gujarat, and he took up his residence at Mahm\u016bd\u0101b\u0101d. Undoubtedly the water and air of Mahm\u016bd\u0101b\u0101d have no resemblance to those of Ahm\u0101d\u0101b\u0101d. By way of testing this I ordered them to hang up a sheep on the bank of the K\u0101nkriya tank after taking off its skin, and at the same time one at Mahm\u016bd\u0101b\u0101d, that the difference of the air might be ascertained. It happened that after seven ghar\u012bs of day had passed in that place (Ahm\u0101d\u0101b\u0101d) they hung up the sheep. When three ghar\u012bs of day remained it became so changed and putrid that it was difficult to pass near it. They hung up the sheep at Mahm\u016bd\u0101b\u0101d in the morning, and it was altogether unchanged until the evening, and began to be putrid when one and a half watches of night had passed. Briefly, in the neighbourhood of Ahm\u0101d\u0101b\u0101d it became putrid in eight sidereal hours, and in Mahm\u016bd\u0101b\u0101d in fourteen hours.\n\nOn Thursday, the 28th, Rustam K., whom my son of prosperous fortune, Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n, had appointed to the charge\n\n* Ganj in No. 181. Perhaps it should be Gajna, see I.G., 17, p. 11.\n\u2020 MSS. Atrak. It is the W\u0101trak of Bayley\u2019s Gujarat, p. 201, and the V\u0101trak of I.G., XXI. 344.\n\u2021 Sult\u0101n Mahm\u016bd III., killed by Burh\u0101n in February, 1554, Bayley\u2019s Gujarat, pp. 449 and 453. Jah\u0101ng\u012br calls him the last Sult\u0101n of Gujarat, because Ahm\u0101d II. and Mu\u1e93affar III. were regarded as spurious. See \u0100yin-i-Akbar\u012b, Jarrett, II. 261.\nand government of Gujarat, was honoured with the gift of an elephant, a horse, and a special *parm narm* (shawl), and given leave to depart, and the Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b officers who were attached to that Subah were presented with horses and dresses of honour according to the rank and standing of each. On Friday, 29th Shahriwar, corresponding with 1st Shaww\u0101l, R\u0101y Bih\u0101r\u012b was honoured with the bestowal of a dress of honour, a jewelled sword and a special horse, and took leave to go to his native place. His sons were also honoured with horses and dresses of honour. On Saturday I ordered Sayyid Mu\u1e25ammad, grandson* (?) of Sh\u0101h \u2018\u0100lam, to ask for whatever he desired without concealment, and I took an oath on the Qoran to this effect. He said that as I had sworn on the Qoran he would ask for a Qoran that he might always have it by him, and that the merit of reading it might accrue to His Majesty. Accordingly, I gave the M\u012br a Qoran in Y\u0101q\u016bt\u2019s\u2020 handwriting. It was a small, elegant\u2021 volume, and was the wonder of the age. On the back of it I wrote with my own hand that I had made this gift on a certain day and in a certain place to Sayyid Mu\u1e25ammad. The real reason for this is that the M\u012br is of an exceedingly good disposition, endowed with personal nobility and acquired excellencies, of good manners and approved ways, with a very pleasing face and open forehead. I have never seen a man of this country of such a pleasing disposition as the M\u012br. I told him to translate this Qoran into plain language without ornament, and that\n\n* Probably great-grandson, for Sh\u0101h \u2018\u0100lam died in 880 (1475-76), as Jah\u0101ng\u012br tells us supra, and he says that he questioned Sayyid Mu\u1e25ammad about Sh\u0101h \u2018\u0100lam\u2019s raising the dead, and that Sayyid Mu\u1e25ammad said he had the story from his father and grandfather. The Ma\u2019\u0101\u0161iru-l-Umar\u0101, III. 447, says Sayyid Mu\u1e25ammad was five removes from Sh\u0101h \u2018\u0100lam.\n\n\u2020 For Y\u0101q\u016bt, see Blochmann, 99-100. He was a famous calligrapher, and lived in the thirteenth century. It appears, however, that Y\u0101q\u016bt\u012b is also the name of a particular kind of writing.\n\n\u2021 Ba-q\u012b\u1e6da-i-ma\u1e6db\u016b\u2019a-mukhta\u1e63ar. Ma\u1e6db\u016b\u2019a is used in modern times to mean \u201cprinted,\u201d but here, I think, it means \u201celegant.\u201d It is so used in the annals of the 12th year, p. 208, line 18, where it is applied to a building. Qi\u1e6da\u2019 probably refers to the shape of the volume, and mukhta\u1e63ar to its small size, or to the minuteness of the writing.\nwithout occupying himself with explanations or fine language he* should translate the Qoran in simple language (lugh\u0101t-i-rikhta) word by word into Persian, and should not add one letter to its exact purport. After he had completed it he should send it by his son Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Sayyid to the Court. The M\u012br\u2019s son is also a young man of external and internal intelligence. The signs of piety and blessedness are distinct on his forehead. The M\u012br is proud of his son, and in truth he is worthy, as he is an excellent youth. As I had repeatedly shown kindness to the holy men of Gujarat, according to their merits, I again bestowed on each cash and jewels, and dismissed them to their homes.\n\nAs the climate\u2020 of this country was not suited to my temperament, the physicians thought it right that I should decrease somewhat my usual number of cups. According to their advice I began to decrease their number, and in the course of a week reduced them by the weight of one cup. At first it was six cups every evening, each cup being $7\\frac{1}{2}$ tola, or altogether 45 tolas. The wine was usually mixed with water. Now I drank six cups, each of which was 6 tolas and 3 m\u0101shas,\u2021 altogether $37\\frac{1}{2}$ tolas.\n\nSixteen or seventeen years ago I had vowed with my God at Allahabad that when I reached fifty I would give up shooting with gun and bullet, and would injure no living thing with my own hand. Muqarrab K., who was one of my confidants, knew of my determination. At this date I have reached the commencement of my fiftieth year, and one day, in consequence of excessive fever (d\u016bd u bukh\u0101r) my breath was short and I was very unwell. While in this condition the compact I had\n\n---\n\n* Sayyid Muhammad, the M\u012br referred to by Jah\u0101ng\u012br, lived into Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n\u2019s reign, not dying till 1045 (1635-36). See P\u0101dsh\u0101h-n\u0101ma, I., Part II., p. 329. But we do not hear anything more of his translation. Perhaps his ill-health prevented him. It is also the fact that orthodox Mu\u1e25ammadans object to translations of the Qoran, regarding it as an impossible task. The M\u012br\u2019s son became chief ecclesiastical officer (\u1e62adr) under Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n. See Ma\u2019\u0101\u1e63iru-l-Umar\u0101, III. 447, and P\u0101dsh\u0101h-n\u0101ma, I., Part II., p. 328.\n\n\u2020 Elliot, V. 361.\n\n\u2021 There were twelve m\u0101shas in a tola; the six cups, then, of 6 tolas and a quarter came to $37\\frac{1}{2}$ tolas.\nmade with my God came, by Divine inspiration, into my mind, and I resolved that when my fiftieth year was completed and the period of fulfilling my vow had arrived, I would, on the day* on which I visited my father's tomb\u2014may the light of God be his testimony\u2014by God's help, seek the confirmation of my resolve from my father's holy elements, and renounce the practice (of shooting). As soon as this thought occurred to me, my illness and trouble disappeared. I revived, and opened my mouth to praise God, and tasted the joy of thanksgiving for His mercies. I hope that I shall be sustained.\n\n\"How well said Fird\u016bs\u012b of pure nature\nMay mercy rest on that (his) pure tomb.\n\"Ah! spare yon emmet\u2020 rich in hoarded grain;\nHe lives with pleasure, and he dies with pain.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the 4th of the Divine month, Sayyid Kab\u012br and Bakhtar K., the Wakils of \u2018\u0100dil K., who had brought his offering to the exalted Court, obtained leave to return. Sayyid Kab\u012br was honoured with a dress of honour, a horse, and a jewelled dagger, and Bakhtar K. with a horse, a dress of honour, and a jewelled \u016brb\u0101si,\u2021 which the people of that country (the Deccan ?) wear round their necks, and a present of 6,000 darbs was given to each of them for expenses.\n\nAs \u2018\u0100dil K. was constantly asking for a likeness of myself through my prosperous son Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n, I sent him one with a ruby of great value and a special elephant. A gracious\n\n* Jah\u0101ng\u012br visited his father's tomb in the following year (the 14th). The passage describing the renunciation of shooting (not of hunting) is translated in Elliot, VI. 362.\n\n\u2020 The version of the last two lines is by Sir William Jones, and is given by him in his Tenth Anniversary Discourse, delivered on February 28, 1793. As my friend Mr. Whinfield has pointed out to me, the quotation comes from the story of Shibli and the ant in the second chapter of the B\u016bst\u0101n. It occurs in the sixth story of the second book and p. 161 of Graf's edition. Sir William Jones's remark is: \"Nor shall I ever forget the couplet of Firdausi, for which Sadi, who cites it with applause, pours blessings on his departed spirit.\" The quotation from Fird\u016bs\u012b occurs on p. 67 of Vol. I. in Macan's edition of the Sh\u0101h-n\u0101ma.\n\n\u2021 \u016arv\u0101si is the name of a celestial nymph. It is also stated by Forbes to be the name of an ornament worn on the breast.\nfarman was issued that he should be presented with whatever territory of Ni\u1e93\u0101mu-l-mulk or Qu\u1e6dbu-l-mulk he might get into his possession, and whenever he should require any support and assistance, Sh\u0101h-naw\u0101z K. should prepare an army and appoint it to assist him. In former days Ni\u1e93\u0101mu-l-mulk was the largest of the rulers of the Deccan, a superior whom all acknowledged, and whom they considered as their eldest brother. At this period \u2018\u0100dil K. did approved service, and was honoured with the exalted title of \u201cson.\u201d I appointed him the head and leader of the whole country of the Deccan, and wrote this quatrain on the portrait with my own hand:\n\n\u201cO thou towards whom is always (turned) the eye of my kindness\nRepose at ease under the shadow of my fortune,\nI have sent thee my own portrait,\nThat thou mayest see me spiritually from my picture.\u201d\n\nMy son Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n sent \u1e24ak\u012bm Kh\u016bsh-h\u0101l, son of \u1e24ak\u012bm Hum\u0101m, who was one of the excellent house-born ones of this Court, and from his early years had been in my son\u2019s service, in company with the Wakils of \u2018\u0100dil K. to convey to him the good news of the Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b favour towards him. On the same day M\u012br Jumla was honoured with the duty of \u2018Ar\u1e93-mukarrir. As Kif\u0101yat K., the Diwan of Gujarat, at the time when he was employed in the Diwani of Bengal, in consequence of certain accidents, had lost property (az s\u0101m\u0101n uft\u0101da), a sum of Rs. 15,000 was presented to him.\n\nAt this time two copies of the Jah\u0101ng\u012br-n\u0101ma that had been prepared were laid before me. One of these I had some days previously given to the Mad\u0101ru-l-mulk (centre of the kingdom), I\u2018tim\u0101du-d-daula, and the other I on this day bestowed on (my adopted) son (farzand\u012b), \u0100\u1e63af K. On Friday, the 5th, Bahr\u0101m, son of Jah\u0101ng\u012br Qul\u012b Kh\u0101n, came from the province of Bihar, and had the good fortune to pay his respects. He laid before me some diamonds he had obtained from the mine of Kokra. Approved service had not been performed in that province by Jah\u0101ng\u012br Qul\u012b K., and it was also frequently reported that certain of his brothers and sons-in-law had stretched out the hand of tyranny in that country,\nand were oppressing the servants of God (the people), and that each of them, cutting out a governorship for himself, did not regard the authority of Jah\u0101ng\u012br Qul\u012b. On this account a farman written with my own hand was given to Muqarrab K., one of my confidential old servants, stating that he was appointed Governor of Bihar. I ordered that immediately on receipt of the farman he should hasten to that quarter. Some of the diamonds that Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Fat\u1e25-jang had sent to Court after the taking of the mine had been given to the Government lapidaries to cut. At this time Bahr\u0101m suddenly came to Agra, and was going on to the Court (in Gujarat). Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n (the Governor of Agra) sent along with him some diamonds that were ready. One of them is of a violet* colour, and cannot be outwardly distinguished from a sapphire. Up to this time I had not seen a diamond of this colour. It weighed several surkh,\u2020 and jewellers estimated its value at Rs. 3,000, and represented that if it had been white (saf\u012bd) and had had perfect marks, it would have been worth Rs. 20,000.\n\nThis year I had mangoes up to the 6th Mihr (middle of September). In this country there is abundance of lemons (lim\u016bn), and they are large (b\u0101l\u012bda ?). A Hindu brought some from a garden called K\u0101k\u016b (or Gang\u016b), which were very pleasant and large (b\u0101l\u012bda, perhaps ripe). I ordered them to weigh the largest of them, and it came to 7 tolas.\n\nOn Saturday, the 6th, the Dasahra festival took place. First, they decked out my horses, and paraded them before me. After that they produced the elephants, decorated in a similar way.\n\nAs the Mah\u012b had not become fordable, so that the sublime camp could cross it, and the climate of Ma\u1e25m\u016bd\u0101b\u0101d was quite different (i.e., it was better) from that of other stages, I remained here for ten more days. On Monday, the 8th, I marched and encamped at M\u016bda.\u2021 I had already sent Khw\u0101ja Ab\u016b-l-\u1e24asan Bakhsh\u012b with an active body of servants,\n\n* Text b\u0101 naqsh by mistake for banafsha.\n\u2020 I.O. MS. 181 has \u201cthirty surkh.\u201d\n\u2021 Perhaps the Moondah of Bayley\u2019s map, east of Ma\u1e25m\u016bd\u0101b\u0101d.\nsuch as boatmen, and also oars,* to make a bridge over the Mahi, with instructions not to wait till it was fordable, so that the victorious camp might cross at ease. On Tuesday, the 9th, there was a halt, and on Kamshamba (Wednesday), the 10th, the camp was at the village of Aina.\u2020\n\nAt first the male s\u0101ras used to hold its young one by its leg upside down in his beak, and there was a fear that he might be unkind to it and it might be destroyed. I accordingly ordered them to keep the male separately, and not allow it near its young ones. I now ordered by way of experiment that it should be allowed near them, that the real degree of its unkindness and affection might be ascertained. After allowing it, he displayed much attachment and kindness, and his affection was found to be no less than that of the female; I thus knew that this performance was out of real love. On Thursday, the 11th, there was a halt, and at the end of the day I went to hunt with cheetahs, and two black buck, four does, and a chik\u0101ra were caught. On Sunday, the 14th, I also went to hunt with cheetahs, and caught fifteen head of male and female antelopes. I had ordered Rustam and Suhr\u0101b\u2021 Kh\u0101n, his son, to go out hunting and shoot as many nilgaw as they could. The father and son together killed seven head, male and female. As it was represented to me that there was a tiger in this neighbourhood, a man-killer that had taken to eating men\u2019s flesh, and the people of God were afflicted by it, I ordered my son Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n to save them from its wickedness. He, as ordered, shot it with his gun, and brought it to me at night. I ordered them to skin it in my presence. Although large in appearance, as it was thin, it turned out less in weight than the large tigers I had myself killed. On Monday, the 15th, and Tuesday, the 16th, I went to shoot nilgaw, and on each day shot two blue bulls. On Thursday, the 18th, on the bank of a tank at which I pitched, a feast of cups was held. Rare lotus (kanwal)\n\n* The text has \u0644\u064e\u0628\u0652 \u06a9\u064e\u0627\u062f\u064e\u0629, \u201can oar,\u201d but the word is perhaps \u06a9\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0648\u0627, \u201ca sailor.\u201d I.O.

My private servants enjoyed themselves greatly with cups of wine. Jah\u0101ng\u012br Qul\u012b had sent twenty elephants from Bihar, and Muruwwat K. eight from Bengal, and these were brought before me. One of Jah\u0101ng\u012br Qul\u012b\u2019s and two of Muruwwat\u2019s were placed in my private stud, and the rest were divided amongst my followers. M\u012br K., s. M\u012brz\u0101 Ab\u016b-l-Q\u0101sim Namak\u012bn, who was one of the khanazads of this Court, was promoted to the mansab, original and increased, of 800 personal and 600 horse. Qiy\u0101m K. was appointed to the duty of chief huntsman, and had given him the rank of 600 personal and 150 horse. \u2018\u012azzat* K., one of the B\u0101rha Sayyids, who was distinguished for bravery and ambition, is attached to the province of Bangash. At the request of Mah\u0101bat K., the Governor of that Subah, he was promoted to the mansab of 1,500 personal and 800 horse. Kif\u0101yat K., Diwan of Gujarat, had an elephant given him, and was allowed to depart. I conferred a sword on \u1e62afi K., Bakshi of that Subah. On Friday, the 19th, I went to hunt, and killed a blue bull. I do not remember a bullet passing through a large male nilgaw. Many have passed through females. On this day, at a distance of forty-five paces (qadam), it went through both skins. In the language of hunters a qadam means two feet (g\u0101m\u2020) placed one in front of the other. On Sunday, the 21st, I enjoyed myself with hawking, and ordered M\u012brz\u0101 Rustam, D\u0101r\u0101b K., M\u012br M\u012br\u0101n, and other servants to go and shoot as many nilgaw as they could. They killed nineteen head, male and female. Ten head of antelope were also caught with cheetahs. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm K., Bakhshi of the Deccan, was, at the request of the Commander-in-Chief, Kh\u0101n Kh\u0101n\u0101n, promoted to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 200 horse. On Monday, the 22nd, a march was made, and on Tuesday, the 23rd, I again marched. The huntsmen represented that there had been seen in the neighbourhood a tigress with three cubs. As it was on the road I went myself after\n\n* L.O., No. 181, has Ghairat K.\n\n\u2020 g\u0101m sometimes means a step, but here it seems to mean one foot-length. The distance mentioned by Jarrett appears to be 90 feet.\nthem and shot all four, and then went on to the next stage. I crossed the Mahi by the bridge that had been made. Though there were no boats on this river of which a bridge could be made, and the water was very deep and flowing rapidly, Khw\u0101ja Ab\u016b-l-\u1e24asan, the chief Bakhshi, had built with great exertions a very strong bridge two or* three days before. Its length was 140 yards and its breadth 4 yards (dara'). By way of testing it I ordered the elephant Gun Sundar Kh\u0101\u1e63\u1e63 which is one of the large and strong elephants, with three females, to be sent across it. It was so firmly built that its supports did not shake with the weight of elephants of mountainous form.\n\nFrom the most honoured lips of my father I heard as follows: \"In early youth I had taken two or three cups (of wine), and had mounted a full-blooded (mast) elephant. Though I was in my senses, and the elephant in very good training, and was under my control, I pretended that I was out of my senses, and that the elephant was refractory and vicious, and that I was making him charge the people. After that, I sent for another elephant, and made the two fight. They fought, and in doing so went to the head of the bridge that had been made over the Jumna. It happened that the other elephant ran away, and as there was no other escape, he went towards the bridge. The elephant I was on pursued him, and although I had him under control, and he would have halted at the slightest signal, I thought that if I held him back from the bridge the people would regard those drunken ways (of mine) as a sham, and would believe that neither was I beside myself, nor was the elephant violent and headstrong. Such pretences on the part of kings are disapproved of, and so after imploring the aid of God\u2014Glory be to Him\u2014I did not restrain my elephant. Both of them went upon the bridge, and as it was made of boats, whenever an elephant put his forefeet on the edge of a boat, half of it sank, and the other half stood up. At each step there came the thought that the lashings might give way. People on seeing this were overwhelmed in the sea\n\n* No. 181 has \"in three days.\"\nof perplexity and alarm. As the care and guardianship of the Great and Glorious God is ever and in all places the protection of this suppliant, both elephants crossed the bridge in safety.\u201d*\n\nOn Thursday, the 25th, a wine-feast was held on the banks of the Mahi, and some of my intimate servants who had admittance to such assemblies had their hearts delighted by brimming cups and ample favours. Certainly it was an entrancing halting-ground. I stayed here four days for two reasons\u2014first, because of the beauty of the spot, and secondly in order that the people might not be confused in crossing the river.\n\nOn Sunday, the 28th, I marched from the bank of the Mahi. On Monday I marched again. On this day a strange sight was witnessed. The pair of s\u0101ras that had had young ones had been brought from Ahmedabad on Thursday (the 25th). In the Court of the royal enclosure, which had been placed on the bank of a tank, they were walking about with their young ones. By chance both the male and female raised a cry, and a pair of wild s\u0101ras hearing it, and crying out from the other side of the tank, came flying towards them. The male with the male, and the female with the female, engaged in a fight, and although some people were standing about, the birds paid no heed to them. The eunuchs who had been told off to protect them hastened to seize them. One clung to the male and the other to the female. He who had caught the male kept hold of it after much struggling, but the one who seized the female could not hold her, and she escaped from his hand. I with my own hand put rings in his beak and on his legs, and set him free. Both went and settled in their own place.\u2020 Whenever the domestic s\u0101ras raised a cry they responded. I saw a sight of this kind in wild antelopes when I had gone to hunt in the pargana of\n\n* Compare account in Akbar-n\u0101ma, II. 150. Akbar was then twenty years old. There is a picture of the two elephants crossing the bridge with Akbar on the elephant Haw\u0101\u02bei in the Clarke MS. in the Victoria and Albert Museum, South Kensington.\n\n\u2020 Presumably the other side of the tank; it was the wild male s\u0101ras that Jah\u0101ng\u012br put rings upon.\nKarn\u0101l. About thirty of my huntsmen and servants were in attendance when a black buck with some does came in sight, and we let loose the decoy-antelope* to fight him. They butted two or three times, and then the decoy came back. A second time I wanted to put a noose on its horns and to let it go, that it might capture (the wild one). Meanwhile the wild antelope, in the excess of its rage, not looking at the crowd of men, ran without regard to anything, and butting the tame buck two or three times fought with it till it fled. The wild antelope thereupon made its escape.\n\nOn this day news came of the death of \u2018In\u0101yat K. He was one of my intimate attendants. As he was addicted to opium, and when he had the chance, to drinking as well, by degrees he became maddened with wine. As he was weakly built, he took more than he could digest, and was attacked by the disease of diarrhoea, and in this weak state he two or three times fainted. By my order \u1e24ak\u012bm Rukn\u0101 applied remedies, but whatever methods were resorted to gave no profit. At the same time a strange hunger came over him, and although the doctor exerted himself in order that he should not eat more than once in twenty-four hours, he could not restrain himself. He also would throw\u2020 himself like a madman on water and fire until he fell into a bad\u2021 state of body. At last he became dropsical, and exceedingly low and weak. Some days before this he had petitioned that he might go to Agra. I ordered him to come into my presence and obtain leave. They put him into a palanquin and brought him. He appeared so low and weak that I was astonished.\n\n\u201cHe was skin drawn over bones.\u201d\n\nOr rather his bones, too, had dissolved. Though painters have striven much in drawing an emaciated face, yet I have never seen anything like this, nor even approaching to it. Good God, can a son of man come to such a shape\n\n* The hunting of deer with decoys is described in Blochmann\u2019s \u0100y\u012bn, 291.\n\u2020 Apparently a metaphorical expression, \u201cfought with fire and water.\u201d\n\u2021 s\u016b\u2019u-l-q\u012bnya, \u201cBad state of the body, cachexy\u201d (Steingass).\nand fashion? These two couplets of Ust\u0101d* occurred as appropriate:\n\n\"If my shadow do not hold my leg\nI shall not be able to stand till the Resurrection\nNor, from weakness, does my soul see a refuge\nWhere it may for a while rest on my lips.\"\n\nAs it was a very extraordinary case I directed painters to take his portrait. In fact, I found him wonderfully changed. I said to him: \"Beware; in your present state do not for a moment forget God, nor despair of His mercy! If Death grant you quarter (am\u0101n), regard the reprieve as a time for apologizing and for amendment. If your life has come to its close, consider every moment passed in remembrance of God as gain. Trouble not your head about those you are leaving behind. A slight claim of service is a great thing with us.\" As they had spoken to me about his poverty, I gave him Rs. 2,000 for road-expenses, and let him go. Next day he travelled the road of non-existence.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 30th, the bank of the River M\u0101nab\u2020 became the halting-place for the sublime camp. The New Year's\u2021 feast of Thursday was prepared at this place on the 2nd of the Il\u0101h\u012b month of \u0100b\u0101n. Am\u0101nu-llah, s. Mah\u0101bat K., at his request, was promoted to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 300\u00a7 horse, and Girdhar, s. R\u0101y S\u0101l, to that of 1,000\n\n---\n\n* I do not know of any poet with the takhallus Ust\u0101d. Possibly J\u0101m\u012b is referred to. The lines are obscure, and I am not certain of the meaning. The I.O. MSS. omit the negatives in the first two lines.\n\n\u2020 Not identified. I.O. MS. 305, seems to have P\u0101nib. Can it be the M\u0101nchan or Majham? Possibly we should read Ban\u0101s.\n\n\u2021 The I.O. MSS. have not the words Nau R\u016bz, \"New Year,\" and I am not sure what New Year's day is meant. The time was October. Perhaps it was the first day of Z\u012bl-Qa'da that was celebrated, or it may be what is described in Richardson as the New Year's day of the Balance\u2014viz., the entry of the Sun into the Sign of the Balance. Jah\u0101ng\u012br may have had special regard to that Sign as he was born under it. Perhaps all that is meant is that the feast of 1 \u0100b\u0101n was celebrated. \u0100b\u0101n was a sacred month because Akbar was born in it, and it may be that the feast was celebrated on Thursday the 2nd because the previous day, Wednesday, was regarded by Jah\u0101ng\u012br as unlucky, and was always spoken of as Kam-shamba. But most probably Nau R\u016bz is simply a mistake of the text.\n\n\u00a7 I.O. MS. have 600.\npersonal and 800 horse. '\u0100bdu-llah, son of Kh\u0101n A'\u1e93am, obtained the mansab of 1,000 personal and 300 horse. Dil\u012br K., who was one of the jagirdars of Gujarat, I presented with a horse and an elephant. Ran-b\u0101z K., s. Sh\u0101h-b\u0101z K. K\u0101mb\u016b, came by order from the Deccan, and was promoted to the post of Bakhshi and Recorder of the army of Bangash, and his mansab was fixed at 800 personal and 400 horse. I marched on Friday, the 3rd. At this stage* Prince Shuja', the beloved son (liver-corner) of my son Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n, who was being brought up in the chaste lap of N\u016br-Jah\u0101n Begam, and towards whom I have so much affection that he is dearer to me than life, was attacked by a specially infantile disease which they call \"ummu-\u1e63-siby\u0101n,\"\u2020 and for a long time his senses left him. Although experienced people devised many remedies, they were unprofitable, and his insensibility (bi-h\u016bsh\u012b) took away my senses (h\u016bsh). As visible remedies were hopeless, by way of humility and submission I rubbed the head of supplication on the Court of the gracious Ruler who cherishes his slaves, and begged for the child's recovery. In this state it occurred to me that as I had made a vow\u2021 to my God that after I had passed my fiftieth year, this suppliant would give up hunting with bullet and gun, and would injure no creature with his own hand, if for the sake of his safety I were to give up shooting from the present date, it were possible that his life would become the means of preserving the lives of many animals, and God Almighty might give him to me. In fine, with true purpose, and sincere belief I vowed\u00a7 to God that I would thenceforward not harm any living thing with my own hand. By the grace of Allah his illness diminished. At the time when this suppliant was in his mother's womb, one day I made no movement after the manner that other children make. The attendants were\n\n* The name of the stage is not given.\n\n\u2020 Literally the mother of children, but explained as meaning a female demon (larva) who torments children. See Lane's Dictionary, 1650, where it is described as \"flatulence.\"\n\n\u2021 See above, p. 243 of text.\n\n\u00a7 Apparently the vow applied only to shooting. Jah\u0101ng\u012br was not at that time fifty-one years of age by solar computation.\namazed, and inquiring into the cause stated the case to my father (Akbar). At that time my father was engaged in hunting with cheetahs. As that day was a Friday, for the purpose of my safety he made a vow that during his life he would not hunt with cheetahs on a Friday. Till the end of his life he remained firm in this determination, and I also in obedience to him until now have never hunted with cheetahs on a Friday. Finally, on account of the weakness of the light of my eye, Sh\u0101h Shuj\u0101\u2018, for three days I halted at this stage, that God Almighty might give him his natural* life.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 7th, I marched. One day the son of \u1e24ak\u012bm \u2020 \u2018\u0100l\u012b was praising the milk of a camel. It occurred to me that if I could continue that for some days, it was possible that it might do some good, and it might prove agreeable to me. \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n had a Persian camel in milk, and I took a little of it. Contrary to the milk of other camels, which is not devoid of saltiness, it appeared to my taste sweet and delicious, and now for a month past I have been drinking every day a cup of it, equal in quantity to half a water-cup, and it is clearly advantageous, for it quenches my thirst. It is strange that two years ago \u0100\u1e63af K. bought this camel, but at that time it had not a young one, and had no sign of milk. At this time by chance milk flowed from its dugs. They gave it every day to drink four seers of cow\u2019s milk with five seers of wheat, one seer of black\u2021 sugar, and one seer of fennel (b\u0101dy\u0101n), to make its milk delicious, sweet, and profitable. Certainly it suited me admirably, and was to my taste. By way of testing it, I sent for some cow\u2019s and buffalo\u2019s milk, and tasted all three. There was no comparison in sweetness and flavour with the milk of this camel. I ordered them to give the same kind of food to some other female camels, that it might become clear whether the purity was in consequence of eating good food; or whether it was due to the natural sweetness of this (particular) camel\u2019s milk.\u00a7\n\n* The natural term of life, which some Orientals regarded as being 120 years.\n\u2020 The name \u2018\u0100l\u012b is omitted in text.\n\u2021 qand-i-siy\u0101h (? treacle).\n\u00a7 We are not told what was the result of this experiment.\nOn Wednesday, the 8th, I marched, and halted on the 9th. The royal tent was pitched near a large tank. Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n presented me with a boat made after the Kashm\u012br fashion, the sitting-place of which they had made of silver. At the end of that day I embarked in that boat and went round the tank. On this day \u2018\u0100bid K., Bakhshi of Bangash, who had been summoned, came and had the good fortune to kiss the threshold, and was honoured with the post of D\u012bw\u0101n-i-buy\u016bt\u0101t. Sar-far\u0101z Khan, who was one of the auxiliaries of Gujarat, received a standard, a private tipch\u0101q horse, and an elephant, and, overwhelmed with honour, obtained leave to go. \u2018\u012azzat* Kh\u0101n, who was one of those attached to the army of Bangash, was exalted with the gift of a standard. Marching was ordered on Friday, the 10th. M\u012br M\u012br\u0101n was promoted to the mansab of 2,000 personal and 600 horse. On Saturday, the 11th, the auspicious equipage alighted in the pargana of Doh\u0101d. On the eve of Sunday, the 12th of the Il\u0101h\u012b month of \u0100b\u0101n, in the thirteenth year from my accession, corresponding with the fifteenth Z\u012bl-Qa\u02bfda of the Hijr\u012b year 1027, in the nineteenth degree of Libra, the Giver of blessings gave my prosperous son Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n a precious son by the daughter of \u0100\u1e63af K. I hope that his\u2020 advent may be auspicious and blessed to this everlasting State.

The I.O. MSS. have Tamarna.\nthe sun rose the camp was pitched on the bank of the tank of B\u0101kh\u016br. At the end of the day, the feast of cups was held and I presented cups to some of my private servants. On Friday, the 17th, I ordered a march. Kesho D\u0101s M\u0101r\u016b is a jagirdar in that neighbourhood. According to orders, he came from the Deccan, and was honoured by doing homage.\n\nOn Saturday, the 18th (\u0100b\u0101n), the camp was at R\u0101mg\u0101rh. For some nights before this there appeared, at three ghar\u012bs before sunrise, in the atmosphere, a (luminous) vapour in the shape of a pillar.* At each succeeding night it rose a ghar\u012b earlier. When it assumed its full form, it took the shape of a spear (harba), thin at the two ends, and thick in the middle. It was curved like a sickle, and had its back to the south, and its face to the north. It now showed itself a watch (pahar) before sunrise. Astronomers took its shape and size by the astrolabe, and ascertained that with differences of appearance (?) it extended over twenty-four degrees. It moved in high heaven, but it had a movement of its own, differing from that of high heaven, for it was first in Scorpio and afterwards in Libra. Its declination (har\u0101kat-i-\u2018arz ?) was mainly southerly. Astrologers call such a phenomenon a spear (harba) in their books, and have written that its appearance portends weakness to the kings of Arabia, and points to their enemies prevailing over them. God knows! Sixteen nights after this phenomenon, a star showed itself in the same quarter. Its head was luminous, and its tail was two or three yards long, but the tail was not luminous. It has now appeared for eight nights; when it disappears, the fact will be noticed, as well as the results of it.\n\nI halted on Sunday, the 19th, and on Monday I alighted at the village of Sitalkhera.\u2020 On Tuesday, the 21st, there was\n\n* I have been assisted by the translation in Elliot, VI. 363.

Perhaps the first phenomenon was the Zodiacal Light.\n\n\u2020 The MSS. have Sambhalkhera.\nagain a halt. I presented Rash\u012bd K., the Afghan, with a robe of honour and an elephant, sending them to him by Ran-b\u0101z K. On Wednesday, the 22nd, the camp rested in pargana Madanp\u016br.* On Thursday, the 23rd, I halted and had a feast of cups, and D\u0101r\u0101b K. had a n\u0101dir\u012b dress of honour given to him. Halting on Friday, on Saturday the camp was pitched in the pargana of Naw\u0101r\u012b.\u2020 On Sunday, the 26th, I pitched on the bank of the River Chambal, and on Monday on the bank of the River Kahnar\u2021 (?). On Tuesday, the 28th, the royal standards were raised in the neighbourhood of the city of Ujain. From A\u1e25madabad to Ujain is a distance of ninety-eight kos. It was traversed in twenty-eight marches and forty-one halts\u2014that is, in two months and nine days. On Wednesday, the 29th, I had an interview with Jadr\u016bp, who is one of the austere ones of the Hindu religion, and the particulars of whose circumstances have been described in the preceding pages, and went with him to see K\u0101liy\u0101daha. Certainly association with him is a great privilege.\n\nOn this day it was made known to me in the contents of a report from Bah\u0101dur K., the Governor of Qandahar, that in the Hijr\u012b year 1026\u2014that is, last year\u2014the number of mice in Qandahar and the neighbourhood was so great that they destroyed all the crops and grain and cultivation and the fruits of the trees of the province, so that there had been no produce. They (the mice) cut off the ears of corn and ate them. When the cultivators gathered their crops, before they were threshed and cleaned, another\u00a7 half was destroyed, so that perhaps one-fourth of the crops only came to hand. In the same way no vestige was left of the melons (melon-beds) or garden produce. After some time the mice disappeared.\n\n* MSS. have Badhn\u016br. Perhaps it is the Badhn\u0101war of Jarrett, II.\n\u2020 Pargana N\u016bl\u0101\u2019i in MSS., and this seems right as Nol\u0101\u2019i, is mentioned in Jarrett, II. 198, as having a brick fort and as being on the Chambal.\n\u2021 It seems to be Gambhir in the MSS.\n\u00a7 There seems to be an omission in the recital. We are not told of the first half, but evidently the meaning is that the mice (or rats) ate half the crop on the field, and half of what was brought into the threshing floor. See also Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, p. 118.\nAs my son Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n had not made a birthday entertainment for his son (Aurangz\u012bb), he petitioned at Ujain, which is the place of his jagir, that the Thursday entertainment of the 30th should be held at his abode. Of necessity, having consented to the carrying out of his wish, the day was passed in enjoyment at his quarters. My private servants who have the entr\u00e9e into this kind of parties and assemblies were delighted with brimming cups. My son Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n brought that auspicious child before me, and, presenting as offerings a tray of jewels, and jewelled ornaments, and fifty elephants, thirty male and twenty female, asked me for a name for him. Please God it will be given him in a favourable hour. Of his elephants seven were included in my private stud; the rest were distributed among the faujdars. The value of the offerings that were accepted will be Rs. 200,000.\n\nOn this day \u2018A\u1e93udu-d-daula (Jam\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn \u1e24usain Anj\u016b) came from his jagir, and had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. He gave eighty-one muhars as nazr, and an elephant as an offering. Q\u0101sim K., whom I had dismissed from the government of Bengal, had been sent for, and having had the good fortune to do homage, presented 1,000 muhars as nazr. On Friday, the 1st of \u0100\u1e93ar, I amused myself with hawking. As the retinue passed along, a field of millet (jw\u0101r) was met with. Though generally a stem has only one head, each of them had twelve. I was astonished, and at this time the tale of \u201cThe King and the Gardener\u201d occurred to me.\n\n**Tale of \u201cThe King and the Gardener.\u201d**\n\nA King came to the gate of a garden in the heat of the day. He saw an old gardener standing at the gate, and asked him if there were any pomegranates in the garden. He said: \u201cThere are.\u201d He told him to bring a cup of pomegranate juice. The gardener had a daughter adorned with grace of person, and beauty of disposition. He made a sign to her to bring the pomegranate juice. The girl went and at once.\n\n* Elliot, VI. 364.\nbrought a cup full of pomegranate juice, and placed some leaves upon it. The King took it from her hand and drank it. Then he asked the girl what was her reason for placing leaves on the top of the juice. She, with an eloquent tongue and a sweet voice, represented that it was not wise at once to drink off a quantity of liquid when he was bathed in perspiration, and in such a hot air. On this account she had placed the leaves on the liquid by way of precaution, so that he might drink it slowly. The King was greatly pleased with her sweet ways, and it crossed his mind to admit the girl into his Palace. After this he asked the gardener: \"How much profit do you derive from this garden every year?\" He answered: \"Three hundred dinars.\" The King asked: \"What do you pay the Diwan (tax-collector)?\" He answered: \"The King takes nothing from the trees, but takes a tenth of the cultivated crops.\" It came into the King's mind that there were in his dominions many gardens and countless trees. If he were to get a tenth of the garden produce as well, it would amount to a large sum, and there would be no great loss to the cultivator. Hereafter he would order a tax to be levied on garden produce. He said then: \"Bring me a little more pomegranate juice.\" The girl went, and after a long time brought a small quantity. The King said: \"The first time thou camest quickly, and broughtest more. This time thou didst stay a long time, and broughtest less.\" The girl said: \"The first time I had filled the cup with the juice of one pomegranate, and brought it; this time I pressed out five or six pomegranates and did not get as much juice.\" The astonishment of the King increased. The gardener represented: \"The blessing of produce depends on the goodwill of the King. It occurs to me that you must be a King. At the time when you inquired of me the income from the garden, your disposition must have changed. Consequently the blessing passed away from the fruit.\" The Sultan was impressed, and drove that idea out of his heart. He then said: \"Bring me once more a cup of pomegranate juice.\" The girl went again, and quickly bringing a cup full to the brim, gave it, smiling and gladly, into the Sultan's hand. He praised the intelligence of the\ngardener, and explained the actual state of affairs, and begged the girl of him in marriage, and married her.\n\nThis true tale of that truth-preserving King has remained as a memento on the page of time. In truth, the manifestation of such spiritual (?) results is the mark of good intentions, and the fruit of justice. Whenever all the energies and purposes of justice-observing Kings are devoted to the comfort of the people and the contentment of their subjects, the manifestations of well-being and the productions of fields and gardens are not far off. God be praised that in this age-enduring State no tax has ever been levied on the fruit of trees, and is not levied now. In the whole of the dominion not a d\u0101m nor one grain (habba)\u2020 on this account enters the public treasury, or is collected by the State. Moreover, there is an order that whoever makes a garden on arable land, its produce is exempted. I trust that God (to whom be glory!) will always incline this suppliant towards what is good.\n\n\u201cWhen my purpose is good, do Thou grant me good.\u201d\u2021\n\nOn Saturday, for the second time, my desire for the company of Jadr\u00fcp increased. After performing the midday devotions, I embarked in a boat and hastened to meet him, and at the close of day I ran and enjoyed his society in the retirement of his cell. I heard many sublime words of religious duties and knowledge of divine things. Without immoderate praise, he sets forth clearly the doctrines of wholesome Sufism, and one can find delight in his society. He is sixty years old. He was twenty-two years of age, when, forsaking all external attachments, he placed the foot of determination on the highroad of asceticism, and for thirty-eight years he had lived in the garment of nakedness. When I took leave he said: \u201cIn what language can I return thanks for this gift of Allah that I am engaged in the reign of such a just King in the worship of my own Deity in ease and con-\n\n* The word ma\u2018n\u012b, \u201cspiritual,\u201d does not occur in the I.O. MSS., and does not appear to be wanted.\n\u2020 Also a weight = two barley-grains. Blochmann, 36.\n\u2021 The line is wanting in some MSS. In I.O. MS. 181, the conjunction wa is omitted (p. 145b).\ntentment, and that the dust of discomposure from any accident settles not on the skirt of my purpose?\"\n\nOn Sunday, the 3rd, marching from K\u0101liy\u0101daha, I encamped at the village of Q\u0101simkhera. I employed myself on the road in hawking. By chance a crane rose, and the *tuygh\u016bn* falcon, of which I am very fond, was let fly after it. The crane sought to escape, and the falcon soared and flew so high as to disappear from sight. Although the huntsmen and the head-beaters ran after it in all directions, they found no trace of it, and it was impossible for the falcon to be caught in such a desert. Lashkar Mir Kashmir\u012b, who is the head of the Kashmir huntsmen, in whose charge the falcon was, ran in a bewildered state through the desert in all directions without finding a sign or trace. Suddenly he saw a tree in the distance, and when he went up to it he found the falcon sitting on the end of a branch. Showing a domestic fowl, he called to the falcon. Three *ghar\u012bs* more had not passed when he brought it to me. This gift from the hidden world, that had entered into the thoughts of no one, increased the joy of my mind. Increasing his mansab as a reward for this service, I gave him a horse and a dress of honour.\n\nOn Monday, the 4th, Tuesday, the 5th, Wednesday, the 6th, I marched continuously, and, halting on Thursday, the 7th, I arranged a feast of pleasure on the bank of a tank. N\u016br-Jah\u0101n Begam had been ill for some time, and the physicians who had the good fortune to be chosen to attend on her, Musalmans and Hindus, perceived no gain from all the medicines they gave her, and confessed their helplessness in treating her. At this time \u1e24ak\u012bm R\u016b\u1e25u-llah began to wait upon her, and undertook (to find) a remedy. By the aid of God (Glory be to His name!), in a short time she quite recovered. In reward for this excellent service I increased his mansab and bestowed on the \u1e24ak\u012bm three villages in his native country as his private property, and an order was given that he should be weighed against silver, which should be given him as a reward. From Friday, the 8th, until Sunday,*\n\n---\n\n* So in text, but Sunday was either the 10th or the 17th. Apparently Sunday is a mistake for Wednesday, as, later on, Thursday is mentioned as the 14th.\nthe 13th, I made successive marches, and every day up to the end of the stage employed myself in hunting with hawks and falcons (b\u0101z u jurra). Many durr\u0101j (partridges) were caught. On last Sunday, Kunwar Karan, s. R\u0101n\u0101 Amar Singh, having enjoyed the good fortune of kissing the ground, presented his congratulations on the conquest of the Deccan, offering 100 muhars and Rs. 1,000 by way of na\u1e93r, and the value of Rs. 21,000 in jewelled vessels, with some horses and elephants as p\u012bshkash. The horses and elephants I returned to him, and the rest was accepted. The next day I presented him with a dress of honour. To M\u012br Shar\u012bf, Vakil of Q\u016b\u1e6dbu-l-mulk, and to Ir\u0101dat K., the chief butler, an elephant each was given. Sayyid Hizabr K. was given the faujdari of Mew\u0101t, and his mansab, original and increased, was fixed at 1,000 personal and 500 horse. Having selected Sayyid Mub\u0101rak for the charge of the fort of Roht\u0101s, I conferred on him the mansab of 500 personal and 200 horse. On Thursday, the 14th, the camp was pitched on the bank of the tank of the village of Sandh\u0101ra, and the feast of cups was held, and chosen servants were made happy with cups of pleasure. The birds of chase, \u201cthat had been shut up in Agra to moult\u201d (ba-kur\u012bz basta b\u016bdand), were this day brought to me by Khw\u0101ja \u2018Abdu-l-La\u1e6d\u012bf, the Chief Fowler. Picking out those that were fit for my own use, the rest were given to the Am\u012brs and other servants.\n\nOn this day the news of the revolt and ingratitude for favours of R\u0101ja S\u016braj Mal, s. R\u0101ja B\u0101so, came to my ear. B\u0101so had several* sons. Although the above-mentioned was the eldest, his father mostly kept him in confinement on account of his evil thoughts and mischievous tendencies, and regarded him with displeasure. After his (B\u0101so\u2019s) death, as this wretch was the eldest, and he had no other capable or intelligent son, I, looking to the services rendered by R\u0101ja B\u0101so, for the purpose of preserving the family of a Zamindar, and the protection of his hereditary property and country, conferred on this wretch the title of Raja, with a mansab of 2,000, and gave him the position and jagir of his father,\n\n* Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 119, \u201cThree sons.\u201d\nwhich the latter had obtained by his loyalty and good service. I also gave him the sums of money and goods that his father had collected during long years. When the deceased Murta\u1e93\u0101 K. was sent off on the duty of conquering K\u0101ngra, as this wretch was the chief Zamindar of that hill country, he outwardly displayed zeal in the service and loyalty, and was nominated as an auxiliary. After he reached the spot, Murta\u1e93\u0101 K. pressed the siege tightly against the garrison. This evil-minded fellow discovered from the appearance of things that he would soon be victorious, and began to disagree and be troublesome. He took off the veil of respect from his face, and proceeded to quarrel and be hostile to Murta\u1e93\u0101 K.\u2019s men. Murta\u1e93\u0101 K. read the writing of misery and ruin on the page of the wretch\u2019s forehead, and reported unfavourably of him to the Court, or rather wrote plainly that the signs of rebellion and want of loyalty were clear in his conduct. As there was there such an officer as Murta\u1e93\u0101 K. and a large army in the hill-country, the wretch did not find the time convenient for the preparation of a disturbance. He sent a report to my son Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n that Murta\u1e93\u0101 K., at the instigation of interested parties, had turned against him, and desired to overthrow and ruin him, and was accusing him of wrong-doing and rebellion. He hoped that he would summon him to Court, and thus provide a means for his escape and (the prolonging of) his life. Although I had every confidence in the words of Murta\u1e93\u0101 K., yet as he (S\u016braj Mal) begged to be sent for to Court, a doubt passed into my mind that possibly Murta\u1e93\u0101 K., at the instigation of seditious people, might cause a confusion, and might have accused him without due reflection. Briefly, at the request of my son Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n, passing over his offence, I summoned him (S\u016braj Mal) to Court. Just at this time Murta\u1e93\u0101 K. died, and the conquest of the fort of K\u0101ngra was delayed till the dispatch of another leader. When this seditious fellow arrived at Court, I, under the pressure of affairs, rapidly encompassed him with favours and sent him off to do duty with my son Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n in the conquest of the Deccan. After this, when the Deccan had come into the possession of\nthe servants of the enduring State, he, having acquired influence in my son\u2019s service, was appointed to superintend the taking of the fort of K\u0101ngra. Although the sending back of this ungrateful and untruthful one into that hill-country showed a want of caution and care, yet as my son had taken on himself the responsibility of the undertaking, I was obliged to give in to his wish and to leave the matter to him. My fortunate son appointed him, along with one of his own servants of the name of Taq\u012b and a suitable army of man\u1e63ab-d\u0101rs, a\u1e25ad\u012bs, and royal musketeers, as has already been related summarily in these pages. When he arrived at the place, he began to show enmity and trickery toward Taq\u012b also, and displayed his natural disposition. He continually reported unfavourably of him (Taq\u012b), until he wrote plainly that he could not get on with him, and that Taq\u012b could not do the work. If another general were appointed, the fort would be quickly conquered. In fine, he (Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n) had no choice but to summon Taq\u012b to Court, and to appoint R\u0101ja Bikram\u0101j\u012bt, who was one of his chief servants, with an army of fresh men on this service. When the wretch discovered that his stratagems could no longer continue, and his deceit go no farther, he, before the arrival of Bikram\u0101j\u012bt, gave leave to a number of the servants of the Court, on the pretence that they had been on service a long time without proper arrangements (commissariat), to hasten to their jagirs and provide themselves with their equipments before the arrival of R\u0101ja Bikram\u0101j\u012bt. As palpably this came to a dispersion of the forces of the loyal, and most of them left for their own jagirs, only a few experienced men remained there. Seeing his opportunity, he showed the signs of revolt and sedition. Sayyid \u1e62af\u012b B\u0101rha, who was distinguished for his bravery, with some of his brothers and relatives, advanced the feet of courage, and tasted the wholesome draught of martyrdom, and some who were wounded with severe wounds, which are the adornment of the lions of battle, that rascal took captive from the field of strife and carried off to his own house of calamity.* Some from love\u2020 of life hastily withdrew\n\n* Apparently the meaning is that he carried them off as prisoners..\n\u2020 Text j\u0101da-d\u016bst\u012b by mistake for j\u0101n-d\u016bst\u012b.\nthemselves to the corner of safety. That rascal stretched out the hand of oppression and possession over the parganas on the skirts of the hill-country (daman-i-k\u016bh), which mostly belonged to the jagir of I\u2019tim\u0101du-d-daula, and did not abate a hair\u2019s breadth from attacking and plundering. It is hoped that with the same swiftness, he will be caught with the reward of his deeds and the recompense of his actions, and that the spirit* of this State will do its work, please God!\n\nOn Sunday, the 17th, I crossed Gh\u0101\u1e6d\u012b Ch\u0101nd\u0101. On Monday, the 18th, the J\u0101n-sip\u0101r \u0100t\u0101liq Kh\u0101n-kh\u0101n\u0101n, Commander-in-Chief, had the honour of kissing the threshold. As he had been absent from my presence for a long time, and the victorious retinue was passing by near the Sarkars of Khandesh and Burh\u0101np\u016br, he asked to wait upon me, and an order was given that if his mind were at ease in all respects, he should come unattended and return quickly. He accordingly came with all speed, and had the good fortune to pay his respects on this day,* and, having been exalted by the receipt of all kinds of royal favours and kingly benefits, he presented an offering of 1,000 mu\u1e25\u0101rs and Rs. 1,000.\n\nAs the camp had undergone great hardship in crossing the Gh\u0101\u1e6d\u012b, I ordered a halt for the refreshment of the people on Tuesday, the 19th. I marched on Wednesday, the 20th, and on Thursday, the 21st, halted again and held a feast of cups on the bank of a river that is known as the Sind.\u2020 I gave a special horse, of the name of Sumer, which was one of the finest horses, to the Kh\u0101n-kh\u0101n\u0101n. In the Hindi language they call a hill of gold Sumer (Sumeru), and he was called by this name on account of his colour and size. On Friday, the 22nd, and Saturday, the 23rd, two successive marches were made. On this day a wonderful waterfall was seen. The water is exceedingly clear, and pours down with boiling and noise from a lofty place. On all sides of it there are halting places\n\n* Namak, \u201csalt.\u201d See for a similar expression, p. 149, in the account of Ch\u012bn Qil\u012bj. Perhaps the phrase is a reminiscence of the answer given by Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24usain M. when asked who had captured him. \u201cThe king\u2019s salt,\u201d was his reply.\n\n\u2020 The Sind is mentioned in Tiefenthaler, I. 184. See also I.G., new ed., XXII., p. 432. It is one of the chief rivers of Central India.\nwhere one may praise God. Certainly I have not recently seen such another fine waterfall, and it is a delightful recreation-place. I was delighted with the spectacle for a while. On Sunday, the 24th, I halted, and, sitting in a boat on a tank which was in front of the royal enclosure (daulat-kh\u0101na), were shot* ducks (murgh\u0101b\u012b). On Monday, the 25th, Tuesday, the 26th, and Wednesday, the 27th, I marched one after the other. I bestowed on the Kh\u0101n-kh\u0101n\u0101n the p\u016bst\u012bn (sheep-skin coat) I had on my own person, and seven horses from my stable, on which I always rode, were also given him. On Sunday, the 2nd of the Il\u0101h\u012b month of Dai, the royal standards were raised at the fort of Ranthamb\u016br. This is one of the great forts of the Indians. In the time of Sult\u0101n \u2018Al\u0101\u2019u-d-d\u012bn Khalj\u012b, R\u0101y Pitambar Deo was in possession of it. The Sultan besieged it for a long time, and conquered it with labour and great exertions, and in the beginning\u2020 of the reign of H.M. (Akbar)\u2014may the light of God be his witness!\u2014R\u0101y Surjan H\u0101\u1e0d\u0101 had it in his possession. He had always 6,000 or 7,000 horse in attendance on him. That revered one, by the aid of the glorious God, conquered it in the space of one month and twelve days, and R\u0101y Surjan, by the guidance of fortune, having had the good fortune to kiss the threshold, was enrolled among the number of the loyal, and became one of his respectable and trusted Am\u012brs. After him his son R\u0101y Bhoj also was included among the great Am\u012brs. Now his grandson, Sar-buland R\u0101y, is among the chief officers.\n\nOn Monday,\u2021 the 3rd, I went to inspect the fort. There are two hills close to each other. They call one Ran, and the other Thanb\u016br. The fort is built on the top of Thanb\u016br, and, putting these two names together, they have called it Ranthanb\u016br. Although the fort is exceedingly strong, and has plenty of water, the hill of Ran is a specially strong fortress\n\n* The word is shik\u0101r. Either the ducks were caught in nets and not shot, or the shooting was done by others, for Jah\u0101ng\u012br had vowed to give up shooting from the time of Shuj\u0101\u2019s illness.\n\n\u2020 Akbar really took it in the 14th year of his reign (March, 1569). The siege lasted a month, according to Ab\u016b-l-Fa\u1e93l.

Accordingly, my revered father ordered that they should plant cannon on the top of the hill of Ran, and aim at (majr\u0101 g\u012brand) the buildings inside the fort. The first gun they fired reached the square building (chaukand\u012b)* of the palace of R\u0101y Surjan. From the fall of that building, a trembling found its way into the foundations of his courage, and a great perplexity overpowered his heart, and thinking he would best consult his own safety in delivering up the fort, he rubbed the head of worship and humility on the throne of the king of kings, who forgave faults and accepted excuses.\n\nI had intended to pass the night in the fort, and the next day to return to camp. As the buildings inside the fort had been built after the fashion of the Hindus, and the rooms were without air and with little space, they did not please me, nor was I disposed to stay there. I saw a bath house, which one of the servants of Dastam\u2020 Kh\u0101n had built near the wall of the fort. A little garden and a lodging (nish\u012bman) which overlooks (mushrif) the open space is not wanting in space and air, and there is no better place in the whole fort.\u00a7\n\nDastam K. was one of the Am\u012brs of the late King (Akbar), and from his early years had been brought up in his service. His connection with him was confidential and intimate. H.M. had entrusted this fort to him from his exceeding confidence in him.\n\nAfter completing my inspection of the fort and houses, I ordered that they should bring before me the criminals who were confined in the fort, so that I might look into the case of each of them and give an order in accordance with justice. In brief, with the exception of affairs of murder, and of any person through whose release disturbance or calamity might ensue in the country, I freed them all, and to each one in\n\n* For notes about the meaning of the word chaukand\u012b, \u201cfour-cornered,\u201d see Elliot, V. 347 and 503.\n\n\u2020 Text Rustam, but it is Dastam in MS. 181, and it appears from Blochmann that Dastam or Dostam is the proper spelling. See pp. 398 and 620.\n\n\u2021 Apparently Jah\u0101ng\u012br spent the night in this summer-house.\naccordance with his circumstances gave his expenses and dresses* of honour. On the eve of Tuesday, the 4th, I returned to the royal abode after a watch and three gharis had passed. On Sunday (properly Wednesday), the 5th, having marched nearly 5 koss, I halted on Thursday, the 6th. On this day the Kh\u0101n-kh\u0101n\u0101n presented his offering of jewels, ornamented vessels, cloth, and an elephant. Of these I chose whatever pleased me, and returned the rest. What was accepted of his offering was of the value of Rs. 150,000.\n\nOn Friday, the 7th, I marched 5 koss. I had before this captured a s\u0101ras with a falcon, but until now I had never seen the hunting of a durn\u0101\u2020 (crane). As my son Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n had great pleasure in durn\u0101 hunting with the falcon (sh\u0101hin), and his falcons were well grown, at his request I rode out early in the morning, and caught one durn\u0101 myself, whilst the falcon my son had on his wrist caught another. Certainly, of all good hunting amusements, this is the best. I was exceedingly pleased with it. Although the s\u0101ras is large, it is lazy and heavy on the wing. The chase of the durn\u0101 has no resemblance to it. I praise the heart and courage of the falcon that can seize such strong-bodied animals, and with the strength of his talons can subdue them. \u1e24asan K., the chief hunstman of my son, was honoured with an elephant, a horse, and a dress of honour, as a reward for this exhibition of sport, and his son also received a horse and a dress of honour. On Saturday, the 8th, having marched 4\u00bd koss, I halted on Sunday, the 9th. On this day the Kh\u0101n-kh\u0101n\u0101n, the Commander-in-Chief, having raised the head of dignity through the gift of a special dress of honour, a jewelled waist-sword, and a private elephant with trappings, was reappointed to Khandesh and the Deccan. The mansab of that pillar of the kingdom, original and increase, was fixed at 7,000 personal and horse. As he did not get on with Lashkar K., at his request I assigned to \u2018\u0100bid K. the duty of D\u012bw\u0101n-i-\n\n* Khila\u2018\u0101t, surely used here on account of the alliteration kharj\u012b u Khila\u2018\u0101t. At p. 10 of Price\u2019s \u201cJahangir\u201d it is stated that he released 7,000 prisoners from Gwalior Fort!\n\n\u2020 durn\u0101, or turn\u0101, a crane. It is a Turki word.\nbuy\u016bt\u0101t,* and having given him the mansab of 1,000 personal and 400 horse, as well as a horse, an elephant, and a dress of honour, sent him to that Subah. On the same day Kh\u0101n Daur\u0101n arrived from Kabul, and had the good fortune to pay his respects, and presented as n\u0101zr 1,000 muhars and Rs. 1,000, as well as an offering of a pearl rosary, fifty horses, ten Persian male and female camels, and some hawks, and china,\u2020 and porcelain (?), and other things. On Monday, the 10th, I marched 3\u00bd koss, and on Tuesday, the 11th, 5\u00be koss. On this day the Kh\u0101n Daur\u0101n arranged his men before me, and passed in review a thousand Mughal cavalry, most of whom had Turki horses, and some \u2018Ir\u0101q and some Mujannas\u2021 horses. Though his troopers had been mostly dispersed, some going into the service of Mah\u0101bat K. and remaining in that Subah, whilst a number left him at Lahore and went into different parts of the dominion, yet he could show this body of well-mounted men. Certainly the Kh\u0101n Daur\u0101n for valour and generalship is one of the unique of the ages, but alas! I found he had become a decrepit old man, and his sight was very weak. He has two intelligent young sons, who are not wanting in reasonableness, but it will certainly be a great and difficult thing for them to show themselves his equals. On this day I gave him and his sons dresses of honour and swords. On Sunday, the 12th, traversing 3\u00bd koss, I alighted on the bank of the tank of M\u0101nd\u016b.\u00a7 In the middle of the\n\n* The words d\u012bw\u0101n-i-buy\u016bt\u0101t are repeated. It looks as if the word buy\u016bt\u0101t in the second place was a mistake, or if some word implying that Lashkar K. had been appointed director of buildings (d\u012bw\u0101n-i-buy\u016bt\u0101t) had been omitted. Apparently \u2018\u0100bid K. went to the Deccan as D\u012bw\u0101n, and not as D\u012bw\u0101n-i-buy\u016bt\u0101t. Compare Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 122.\n\n\u2020 No. 181 has no conjunction, and makes the meaning \u201cporcelain from Tartary.\u201d\n\n\u2021 See Blochmann, 140 and 233. Ab\u016b-l-Fa\u1e93l says the mujannas horses resemble Persian horses, and are mostly Turki or Persian geldings.\n\n\u00a7 So in text, but evidently M\u0101nd\u016b, or at least M\u0101nd\u016b in Malwa cannot be correct. The MSS. seem to have Hindaun, and possibly this is the place meant. Or it may be the place called Mandawar or Hindaun Road (see I.G., new ed., XIII. 135). The position of Hindaun agrees fairly well with Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s itinerary, for Tiefenthaler, I., 172, says that\ntank there is a stone building, and on one of the pillars the\nquatrain of someone had been engraved. I saw it, and was\namazed. In truth, it is a fine verse:\n\n\"My congenial friends have left me:\nOne by one they've fallen into the hands of death.\nThey were poor drinkers at the banquet of life.\nA moment sooner than us they became drunken.\"*\n\nAt this time I also heard another quatrain of the same\ndescription, which I have recorded because it was very well\nsaid:\n\n\"Alas! that people of intelligence and wisdom have passed away.\nThey have been forgotten in the minds of their contemporaries.\nThose who spoke with a hundred tongues\nAh! what heard they that they became silent.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the 13th, I made a halt. 'Abdu-l-'Az\u012bz K., having come from Bangash, had the good fortune to kiss the\nthreshold. Ikr\u0101m K., who was in charge of the faujdari of\nFathp\u016br and the neighbourhood, was honoured with waiting\non me. Khw\u0101ja Ibr\u0101h\u012bm K., Bakhsh\u012b of the Deccan, was\n\nHindaun is 12 leagues\u2014i.e., koss\u2014S.S.-W. from Bi\u0101na, and Jah\u0101ng\u012br\ngives the distance from M\u0101nd\u016b or Hindaun to the neighbourhood of\nBay\u0101n\u0101 as 8\u00bd koss. Bay\u0101n\u0101 is in the Bhartpur State, and apparently\nabout 21 miles from Hindaun.\n\n* The quatrain which Jah\u0101ng\u012br describes as that of someone (shakhs\u012b)\nis included in 'Umar Khayy\u0101m's poems, and is thus translated by\nWhinfield:\n\n\"My comrades all are gone, Death, deadly foe,\nHath caught them one by one, and trampled low;\nThey shared life's feast, and drank its wine with me,\nBut lost their heads and dropped a while ago.\"\n\n(Quatrain 219, p. 148.)\n\nFitzgerald has it as Quatrain XXII., and his version is:\n\n\"For some we loved, the loveliest and the best\nThat from his Vintage rolling Time hath prest,\nHave drunk their Cup a Round or two before,\nAnd one by one crept silently to rest.\"\n\nThe quatrain is also quoted by Baday\u016bn\u012b, Lowe's translation, p. 192.\nThe phrase tang-shar\u0101b in the third line means \"poor drinkers.\"\nWhinfield has ba-yak shar\u0101b.

M\u012br \u1e24\u0101jj, who is one of the auxiliaries attached to that Subah, and one of the brave young officers, was promoted to the title of Sharza (tiger-whelp) K., and received a standard. On Friday, the 14th, I marched 5\u00bd koss. On Saturday, the 15th, having marched 3 koss, I halted in the neighbourhood of Bay\u0101n\u0101.* There I hastened with the ladies to see the spectacle of the top of the fort. Mu\u1e25ammad, the Bakhsh\u012b of Hum\u0101y\u016bn, who was entrusted with the charge of the fort, had built a fine house overlooking the plain, of great height and with fine air. The tomb of Shaikh Bahl\u016bl is also in that neighbourhood, and is not wanting in excellence. The Shaikh was the elder brother of Shaikh Mu\u1e25ammad Ghaus, and was much versed in the science of incantations by names (of God). Hum\u0101y\u016bn had great affection for him, and the most perfect reliance on him. When he conquered the province of Bengal, he took up his abode there for some time. M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l, by his order, had remained\u2020 at Agra. A body of avaricious servants (qulluq-chiy\u0101n), whose character was mischievous and seditious, taking to the way of faithlessness, came from Bengal to the M\u012brz\u0101, and, working upon his base nature (shaking the chain of his vile heart), led the M\u012brz\u0101 on the road of rebellion and ingratitude for favours, and of irrecognition of duty. The thoughtless M\u012brz\u0101 had the Khutba recited in his own name (proclaimed himself king), and openly raised the standard of rebellion and strife. When the royal ear heard what had taken place from the reports of those who were loyal, he sent Shaikh Bahl\u016bl to admonish the M\u012brz\u0101, and to turn him back from his vain purpose, and to establish his feet on the high-road of sincerity and concord. As these wretches had made\n\n* Bay\u0101n\u0101 (Bi\u0101na) is described in I.G., new ed., VII. 137. It is stated there that it used to have a fort with a very high tower. Bahl\u016bl\u2019s tomb still exists. It was his brother, M. Ghaus, who was most known for his skill in incantations, and who wrote a book on the subject.\n\n\u2020 The story is told in the Akbar-n\u0101ma, Vol. I. Jah\u0101ng\u012br is not correct in saying that Hum\u0101y\u016bn had ordered Hind\u0101l to remain in Agra. Hind\u0101l went there without permission, and doubtless in order to rebel. See also Gul-badan Begam\u2019s \u201cMemoirs,\u201d who, naturally, tries to excuse her brother.\nthe flavour of royalty sweet to the Mirz\u0101\u2019s palate, he became imbued with futile ideas, and would not be loyal. At the instigation of these seditious people he made Shaikh Bahl\u016bl a martyr with the sword of recklessness at the Ch\u0101rb\u0101gh (garden) which H.M. B\u0101bar had made on the bank of the Jumna. As Mu\u1e25ammad Bakhsh\u012b was a disciple of the Shaikh, he carried the body into the fort of Bay\u0101n\u0101, and buried it there.\n\nOn Sunday, the 16th, marching 4\u00bd koss, I came to the stage of Barah.* As the garden and well which had been built by the order of Maryam-zam\u0101n\u012b (Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s mother) in the pargana of J\u016bsat was on the road, I went to inspect them. Certainly the b\u0101\u2019ol\u012b (step-well) was a grand building, and had been built exceedingly well. I ascertained from the officials that a sum of Rs. 20,000 had been expended on this well. As there was much game in this neighbourhood, I halted on Monday, the 17th.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 18th, marching 3\u00bd koss, the host of prosperity halted at the village of D\u0101yarm\u2019a\u2019\u016b.\u2020 On Wednesday, the 19th, marching 2\u00bd koss, the victorious standards were raised on the bank of the Lake of Fathp\u016br. As at the time when the conquest of the Deccan was meditated, the stages and distances from Ranthamb\u016br to Ujain were recorded, it appears unnecessary to repeat them. From Ranthamb\u016br\u2021 to\n\n* This must be the Barmadh Mata mentioned by Beale (see Proceedings A.S.B. for August, 1873, p. 159). Beale says there is a place of worship of the Hindus about 1\u00bd koss from Biana in the district of Bhartpur called Barmadh Mata. In the 7th year of Jah\u0101ng\u012br, 1022, 1613, Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s mother Maryam-zam\u0101n\u012b made a garden and a b\u0101\u2019ol\u012b (step-well) here at a cost of Rs. 20,000. The garden has disappeared, but the building which is over the b\u0101\u2019ol\u012b still exists. Beale gives the inscription. William Finch (Hakluyt Society) speaks of a place called Menhapur, near Biana, where there was a garden made by the Queen-Mother. It was a great sar\u0101y. The pargana J\u016bsat of the text is no doubt the Chausath of Jarrett, II. 183, and of Elliot\u2019s Supp. Gloss., II., p. 83. Barah may be the Parath or Berath of Jarrett, II. 181.\n\n\u2020 Apparently this is the D\u0101\u2019ir or D\u0101bar of Baday\u016bn\u012b, II. 171, and Akbar-n\u0101ma, III. 145. It is described by Baday\u016bn\u012b as being 4 koss from Fathp\u016br. D\u0101\u2019ir may also be read D\u0101bar in MSS., and it is D\u0101bar in the map. It is in the Bhartpur State.\n\n\u2021 So in the MSS. and the text, but must be a mistake for \u0100hmad\u0101bad, which Jah\u0101ng\u012br left on 21 Shahr\u012bw\u0101r or 22 Ramaz\u0101n. See also\nF\u0101\u1e6dhp\u016br by the road by which I came was a distance of 234 koss, in sixty-three marches and fifty-six halts, traversed in 119 days, or, according to solar reckoning, in one day under four months, and by lunar four full months. From the date on which the army of fortune started from the capital for the conquest of the R\u0101n\u0101 and the acquisition of the Deccan until now, when the victorious and prosperous standards have been planted again in the centre of the empire, it is five years and four months. The astrologers and astronomers chose the day of Mub\u0101rak-shamba (Thursday), the 28th of the Divine month of Dai, in my thirteenth year, corresponding with the last day of the Mu\u1e25arram in the Hijr\u012b year 1028 (January 7, 1619), as the proper time at which to enter the capital of Agra.\n\nAt this time, again, it appeared from the reports of the loyal that the disease of the plague was prevalent in Agra, so that daily about 100 people, more or less, were dying of it. Under the armpits, or in the groin, or below the throat, buboes formed, and they died. This is the third year that it has raged in the cold weather, and disappeared in the commencement of the hot season. It is a strange thing that in these three years the infection has spread to all the towns and villages in the neighbourhood of Agra, while there has been no trace of it at F\u0101\u1e6dhp\u016br. It has come as far as Am\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d, which is 2\u00bd koss from F\u0101\u1e6dhp\u016br, and the people of that place (Am\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d) have forsaken their homes and gone to other villages. There being no choice, and considering the observance of caution necessary, it was decided that at this propitious* hour the victorious army should enter the inhabited part of F\u0101\u1e6dhp\u016br in all joy and auspiciousness, and after the\n\nIqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 117. He arrived at the environs of F\u0101\u1e6dhp\u016br on 19 Dai, or about 22 Mu\u1e25arram, 1028 (end of December, 1618). Apparently he considered that he arrived at F\u0101\u1e6dhp\u016br on 20 Dai. He remained on the outskirts and did not enter the town till the 28th (apparently should be 26th or 27th). The Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma 122 makes Jah\u0101ng\u012br arrive at the outskirts of F\u0101\u1e6dhp\u016br on 20 Dai, and it gives the date of his entering the town as 26 Dai or 1 \u1e62afar, 1028 (January 8, 1619). See p. 123.\n\n* Viz., the propitious hour of the 28th Dai, which had been fixed for the entry into Agra, but was now made the time for entering F\u0101\u1e6dhp\u016br.\nsickness and scarcity had subsided and another auspicious hour had been chosen, I should enter the capital, please the Almighty and most holy Allah!\n\nThe Thursday entertainment took place on the bank of the Lake of Fathp\u016br. As the time for entering the town (of Fathp\u016br) was fixed for the 28th, I halted eight days in this place. I ordered them to measure the circumference of the lake,* and it came to 7 koss. At this stage, with the exception of the revered Maryam-zam\u0101n\u012b, who had become very weak, all the Begams and inhabitants of the enclosure of chastity and all the palace employ\u00e9s came out to meet me (istiqb\u0101l). The daughter\u2020 of \u0100\u1e63af K., deceased, who is in the house of \u2018Abdu-llah K.\u2014i.e., is married to \u2018Abdu-llah), s. Kh\u0101n \u0100\u2018\u1e93am, told me a strange and wonderful tale, and strongly insisted upon its truth. I write it on account of its strangeness. She said: \u201cOne day in the courtyard of the house I saw a mouse rising and falling in a distracted state. It was running about in every direction after the manner of drunkards, and did not know where to go. I said to one of my girls: \u2018Take it by the tail and throw it to the cat!\u2019 The cat was delighted, and jumped up from its place and seized it in its mouth, but immediately dropped it and showed disgust. By degrees an expression of pain and trouble showed itself in its face. The next day it was nearly dead, when it entered into my mind to give it a little treacle\u2021 (tiry\u0101q, opium ?). When its mouth was opened, the palate and tongue appeared black. It passed three days in a state of misery, and on the fourth day came to its senses. After this the grain (d\u0101na) of the plague (buboes) appeared in the girl, and from excess of temperature and increase of pain she had no rest. Her colour became changed\u2014it was yellow inclining to black\u2014and the\n\n* The lake was to the north of the city, and is now dried up. It had been made by damming up a stream.\n\n\u2020 Apparently this lady was relating what had occurred in Agra, for Jah\u0101ng\u012br has just told us that the plague did not come to Fathp\u016br. Her father was the \u0100\u1e63af K., known also as Ja\u2018far K. The ladies seem to have come out from Agra to welcome Jah\u0101ng\u012br. His mother came later from Agra, see infra.\n\n\u2021 Tiry\u0101q-i-F\u0101r\u016bq. See Lane\u2019s Dict., p. 304, col. 3.\nfever was high (tap mu\u1e25riq gard\u016bd). The next day she vomited* and had motions, and died. Seven or eight people in that household died in the same way, and so many were ill that I went to the garden from that lodging. Those who were ill died in the garden, but in that place there were no buboes. In brief, in the space of eight or nine days seventeen people became travellers on the road of annihilation.\u201d She also said: \u201cThose in whom the buboes appeared, if they called another person for water to drink or wash in, the latter also caught the infection (sir\u0101yat), and at last it came to such a pass that through excessive apprehension no one would come near them.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, the 22nd, Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n, who had had the charge of Agra, having had the good fortune to kiss the threshold, presented 500 m\u016bhars by way of nazr, and Rs. 400\u2020 as charity. On Monday, the 24th, a special dress of honour was conferred on him. On Mub\u0101rak-shambat\u2021 (Thursday), the 28th (? 27th), after four ghar\u012b\u00a7 or nearly two sidereal hours (sa\u02bfat), had passed,\n\n\u201cIn an hour which agreed with two almanacs (?) (or which marked two events),\u201d\n\n---\n\n* I.O.

The 28th must be a copyist\u2019s mistake here and previously.\n\n\u00a7 Jah\u0101ng\u012br says four ghar\u012b are nearly equal to two sidereal hours. According to Ab\u016b-l-Fa\u017cl, a ghar\u012b is the sixteenth part of a nychthemeron, or 360 out of the 21,600 breathings which make up a nychthemeron\u2014i.e., 24 hours. See Jarrett, III. 16 and 17, and II. 16, n. 4. According to the Bah\u0101r-i-\u02bfajam, 2\u00bd ghar\u012b=one sidereal hour, so that, correctly speaking, five ghar\u012b=two sidereal hours. Each ghar\u012b is 24 minutes (Jarrett, II. 16, n. 4). Here it should be noted that there is a mistake in the translation at p. 17, line 2, of Jarrett, vol. III., due to a faulty reading in the Bib. Ind. edition of the text. Instead of yaki we should read pal\u012b, as in two MSS. in my possession. Ab\u016b-l-Fa\u017cl\u2019s meaning then becomes clear. What he says is, a ghar\u012b is 360 breathings, consequently (pas) every pal (already defined as the sixtieth part of a ghar\u012b) is 360 divided by 60, and equal to six breathings (nafas). Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s line, however, is obscure. In two I.O. MSS. we have ba-t\u0101la\u02bfi instead\nthe royal standards auspiciously and happily entered the inhabited part of Fat\u1e25p\u016br. At the same hour the entertainment (of weighing) for my prosperous and noble son, Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n, was held. I ordered him to be weighed against gold and other things, and his twenty-eighth year according to the solar* months began auspiciously. It is hoped that he may reach the natural\u2020 limit of life. On the same day H.M. the revered Maryam-zam\u0101n\u012b (his mother) came from Agra, and I acquired eternal good fortune from the blessing of waiting on her. I hope that the shadow of her bringing up and affection may be perennial on the head of this suppliant. As Ikram K., s. Isl\u0101m K., had performed the duties of faujd\u0101r of this neighbourhood in a proper manner, I bestowed on him the mansab of 1,500 personal and 1,000 horse, original and increased. Suhr\u0101b\u2021 K., s. Mirz\u0101 Rustam \u0160af\u0101vi, was promoted to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 300 horse.\n\nOn this day, going over in detail the buildings of the palace of the late King (Akbar), I showed them to my son, Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n. Inside of them a large and very clear reservoir of cut stone has been constructed, and is called the Kap\u016br-tal\u0101o (camphor tank). It is a square of 36 yards by 36,\u00a7 with\n\nof ba-s\u0101\u2019at\u012b. I think the meaning probably is that the same day which marked Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s arrival at Fat\u1e25p\u016br also marked Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n\u2019s birthday.\n\nTawall\u0101 is defined in the Bahar-i-\u2018ajam as meaning to have friendship with anyone. It also says that it is used in the sense of taqarrub\u2014i.e., nearness. It may be therefore that Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s line means \u201cAt a moment which nearly corresponded to two (hours).\u201d Taqw\u012bm would then mean established or fixed, and not a calendar. Taqw\u012bm kardan is a phrase which means \u201cto adjust, to arrange.\u201d\n\n* Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n was born on January 5, 1592, so that in January, 1619, he began to be in his 28th year\u2014i.e., he was 27 complete.\n\n\u2020 That is, 120 according to Muhammadan ideas.\n\n\u2021 Afterwards drowned in the Jhelam.\n\n\u00a7 Text dar\u2019a, MSS. zir\u0101\u2019.

If the Kap\u016br tank be the one described in the Archaeological Survey Reports, Vol. XVIII., for 1894, yards seem to be required here, for the tank is mentioned in the Report as being 95 feet 7 inches square. According to Jah\u0101ng\u012br, 34 krors odd of dams\u2014i.e., I presume, ful\u016bs, in copper money, and\na depth of $4\\frac{1}{2}$ yards. By the order of that revered one, the officials of the public treasury had filled it with *ful\u016bs* (copper coins) and rupees. It came to 34 krors, and 48 lakhs, and 46,000 d\u0101ms, and 1,679,400 rupees, or a total of 10,300,000 (one kror and three lakhs) according to Hindustani reckoning, and 343,000 *t\u016bm\u0101n* according to Persian. For a long time the thirsty-lipped ones of the desert of desire were satisfied from that fountain of benignity.\n\nOn Sunday, the 1st Bahman, a reward of 1,000 *darb* (Rs. 500) was given to \u1e24\u0101fi\u1e93 N\u0101d \u2018Al\u012b,* the reciter. For a long time past Mu\u1e25ibb \u2018Al\u012b, s. Bud\u0101gh\u2020 K. Chikan\u012b, and Ab\u016b-l-Q\u0101sim G\u012bl\u0101n\u012b, whom the Ruler of Ir\u0101n had blinded and driven into the desert of exile, have passed their days in ease under the refuge of this State. To each of them, according to his condition, an allowance for living had been granted. On this day they came from Agra, and had the good fortune to kiss the threshold, and each of them was presented with Rs. 1,000. The *Mub\u0101rak-shamba* entertainment was held in state in the palace, and my private servants were gladdened with cups of pleasure. Nasru-llah, whom my son, Sult\u0101n\n\n---\n\n16 lakhs and 80,000 rupees in silver were poured into the tank, making a total of 1 kror and 3 lakhs of rupees, or 3 lakhs 43,000 *t\u016bm\u0101ns*. Apparently the *t\u016bm\u0101n*, which was a gold coin, was, in Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s time, reckoned as worth 30 rupees, and Wollaston, in his Dictionary, says it was worth \u00a33 in Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s I.\u2019s time. Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s account of the tank should be compared with that given in the Akbar-n\u0101ma, III. 246 and 257, where the tank is called the An\u016bp-tal\u0101o, or the \u201cUnequalled Tank.\u201d\n\nIn the text, difficulty has, I think, been made by the introduction of the word *kih* in p. 260, six lines from foot, and *b\u0101shad* in the fifth line from the foot. These words make the sense to be that 34 krors odd of dams were only equal to 16 lakhs odd of rupees. But this cannot be, for the dam was the fortieth part of a rupee, and so 34 krors of dams would be not far short of one kror\u2014i.e., 100 lakhs of rupees. The MSS. have not the *kih* and *b\u0101shad* in question, and have only a conjunction after the word *d\u0101m*. Thirty-four krors odd of copper and 16 lakhs of silver were poured into the tank, making a total, in round numbers, of 1 kror, 3 lakhs of rupees. According to Ab\u016b-l-Fa\u017cl gold was also thrown in.\n\n* Text Y\u0101d \u2018Al\u012b, but the MSS. have N\u0101d.

A copy (jild) of the Jah\u0101ng\u012br-n\u0101ma, together with a special tipch\u0101q horse, were given to him to take to my son. On Sunday, the 8th, Kunwar Karan, son of R\u0101n\u0101 Amar Singh, was presented with a horse, an elephant, a dress of honour, a jewelled khapwa, and a ph\u016bl-kat\u0101ra. I gave him leave to go to his jagir, and sent a horse with him for the R\u0101n\u0101. On the same day I went out sporting to Am\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d. As there was an order that no one should kill the antelope of that region, in the course of six years many antelope had come together, and they had grown very tame. On Thursday, the 12th, I returned to the palace, and on that day, according to custom, a feast of cups was prepared.\n\nOn the eve of Friday, the 13th (Bahman), I went to the mausoleum of the refuge of pardon, Shaikh Sal\u012bm Chisht\u012b, a little concerning whose blessed qualities has been written in the preface\u2020 to this record of prosperity, and the f\u0101tiha was recited. Although the manifestation of miracles and wonders is not approved by the elect of the throne of God, and from humility and a feeling of their low rank (as saints) they avoid such display, yet occasionally in the excitement of ecstasy an appearance is manifested unintentionally and without control,\u2021 or for the sake of teaching someone the exhibition is made. Among these was this, that he before my birth gave my father the good news of the advent of this suppliant and of my two brothers. Again, one day my father incidentally asked him how old he was, and when would he depart to the abiding regions. He replied: \u201cThe glorious God knows what is secret and hidden.\u201d After much urgency he indicated this suppliant (Prince Sal\u012bm), and said: \u201cWhen the Prince, by the instruction of a teacher or in any other way, shall commit something to memory and shall recite it, this will be a sign of my union with God.\u201d In consequence of this, His Majesty gave strict orders to all who were in attendance on me that no one should teach me anything in prose or verse.

She used to burn rue constantly in order to avert the evil eye, and on this pretext had access to me. She used to partake of the alms and charities. She found me alone and regardless of (or ignorant of) what had been said (by Akbar), she taught me this couplet:\n\n\u201cO God, open the rosebud of hope\nDisplay a flower from the everlasting garden.\u201d\u2020\n\nI went to the Shaikh and repeated this couplet. He involuntarily rose up and hastened to wait on the King, and informed him of what had occurred. In accordance with Fate, the same night the traces of fever appeared, and the next day he sent someone to the King (with the request) to call T\u0101n Sen Kal\u0101want, who was unequalled as a singer. T\u0101n Sen, having gone to wait upon him, began to sing. After this he sent some one to call the King. When H.M. came, he said: \u201cThe promised time of union has come, and I must take leave of you.\u201d Taking his turban from his head, he placed it on mine, and said: \u201cWe have made Sult\u0101n Sal\u012bm our successor, and have made him over to God, the protector and preserver.\u201d Gradually his weakness increased, and the signs of passing\u2021 away became more evident, till he attained union with the \u201cTrue Beloved.\u201d\n\nOne of the greatest monuments of my father\u2019s reign is this mosque and cemetery (rau\u1e93a). Certainly they are exceedingly lofty and solid buildings. There is nothing like this mosque in any other country. It is all built of beautiful stone, and five lakhs of rupees were expended from the public treasury upon it. Qutb\u016b-d-d\u012bn K. Kokalt\u0101sh made the marble railing (mahjar) round\u00a7 the cemetery, the flooring (fars\u012bh) of the\n\n* \u2018aur\u0101t-i-must\u0101\u1e25aqqa.

Jah\u0101ng\u012br was born on 17 Rabi\u2018 1st, 977; and so he would be about two years and seven months old at the time of Sal\u012bm\u2019s death.

The mosque has two great gateways. The one* towards the south is extremely lofty, and is very beautiful. The archway (p\u012bsh\u1e6d\u0101q) is 12 yards broad, 16 long, and 52 high. One must mount thirty-two steps to get to the top of it. The other gateway is smaller, and is towards the east. The length of the mosque from east to west, including the width of the walls, is 212 yards. Out of this, the Maq\u1e63\u016bra (the chancel) is 25\u00bd yards, the middle is 15 yards by 15, the portico (p\u012bsh\u1e6d\u0101q) is 7 yards broad, 14 yards long, and 25 yards high. On each side of the large dome are two smaller domes 10 yards by 10. Then there is a veranda (aiw\u0101n) which is pillared. The breadth of the mosque from north to south is 172 yards. Round it are ninety verandas (aiw\u0101n) and eighty-four cells. The breadth of each cell is 4 yards,\u2020 and the length 5 yards. The verandas are 7\u00bd yards broad. The courtyard (s\u0101l\u012bn) of the mosque, exclusive of the maq\u1e63\u016bra, and the verandas, and the gates, is 169 yards long and 143 yards broad. Above the verandas, the gates, and the mosque, small domes have been constructed, and on the eves of anniversaries and on holy days lamps are placed in these, and they are enveloped in coloured\u2021 cloths, so that they look like lamp-shades (?). Under the courtyard they have made a well, and they fill this with rainwater. As Fathpur has little water, and what there is is bad, this well\u00a7 yields a sufficient supply for the\n\n* This is the Buland Darw\u0101za. It was built many years after the mosque. For an account of it, see Mr. Edmund Smith\u2019s Fathpur Sikri. The gateway is there said to be 134 feet high from the pavement and 176 feet from the roadway. The thirty-two steps mentioned in text must be those from the roadway to the gate. There are two flights of steps, and the total number, up to the top, is 123. The quadrangle or court is stated by Keene to be 433 feet by 366. Another statement (in the Archaeological Report) is 438\u00b79 by 359\u00b710 feet. Sal\u012bm\u2019s tomb was erected in 1581 (988). It is 47 feet 11 inches each way.\n\n\u2020 4\u00bd, Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 124.\n\n\u2021 Text aiw\u0101n, but should be alw\u0101n, \u201ccoloured.\u201d See Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 124.\n\n\u00a7 Finch says: \u201cUnder the courtyard is a good tank of excellent water.\u201d He also speaks of the lake and of its being covered with the sing\u0101ra (Trapa bicornis).\nwhole year for the members of the family (of Salim Chisht\u012b) and for the dervishes who are the muj\u0101wirs (caretakers) of the mosque. Opposite the great entrance and towards the north-north-east is the tomb of the Shaikh. The middle dome is 7 yards, and round the dome is a portico of marble, and on the front side of this is a marble lattice. It is very beautiful. Opposite this tomb on the west, at a little distance, is another dome, in which are laid to rest the sons-in-law and sons of the Shaikh, such as Qu\u1e6dbu-d-d\u012bn K., Isl\u0101m K., Mu\u02bfazzam K.,* and others, who were all connected with this family, and rose to the position of Amirs and to lofty rank. Accordingly, the circumstances of each have been recorded in their places. At present the son of Isl\u0101m K., who is distinguished by the title of Ikr\u0101m K., is the lord of the prayer-carpet. The signs of auspiciousness are manifest in him; I am much inclined to cherish him.\n\nOn Thursday, the 19th, I promoted \u2018Abdu-l-\u2018Az\u012bz K. to the mansab of 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse, and nominated him to the duty of taking the fort of K\u0101ng\u1e5ba, and the overthrow of the ungrateful S\u016braj Mal. I bestowed on him an elephant, a horse, and a dress of honour. Turs\u016bn Bah\u0101dur was also dispatched on this duty, and his mansab was fixed at 1,200 personal and 450 horse. He was given a horse, and took his leave. As the house of I\u2019tim\u0101du-d-daula was on the bank of a tank, and people praised it greatly as a delightful place and enchanting residence, at his request on Thursday, the 26th, an entertainment was held there. That pillar of the kingdom engaged in the dues of prostration and offerings, and prepared a grand meeting. At night, after eating food, I returned to the palace. On Thursday, the 3rd of the Divine month of Isfand-arnuz, Sayyid \u2018Abdu-l-Wahh\u0101b B\u0101rha, who had done active service in Gujarat, was promoted to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 500 horse, and was honoured with the title of Dil\u012br K. On Saturday, the 12th, I went out to Am\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d for sport, and until Sunday, with the ladies,\n\n* That is, B\u0101yaz\u012bd, a grandson of the saint.

On the eve of Thursday, the 27th* (17th), I returned to the palace.\n\nBy chance, on Tuesday, during the hunting, a string of pearls and rubies that Nur-Jahan Begam had on her neck was broken, and a ruby of the value of Rs. 10,000 and a pearl worth Rs. 1,000 were lost. Although the huntsmen made every search for it on Wednesday, it did not fall into their hands. It occurred to me that as the name of the day was Kam-shamba, it was impossible to find it on that day. On the contrary, as Mub\u0101rak-shamba (Thursday) was always a lucky day for me, and had been blessed to me, the huntsmen on that day with but a little search found both in that trackless place (without head or foundation) and brought them to me. The best of coincidences was that on the same propitious day the entertainment for my lunar weighing and the feast of Basant-b\u0101r\u012b (Spring festival) also took place, and the good news of the conquest of the fort of Mau and the defeat of that evil-fortuned S\u016braj Mal arrived.\n\nThe particulars of this are that when R\u0101ja Bikram\u0101jit with the victorious army arrived in that region, the ill-fated S\u016braj Mal desired to delay him for some days by trickery and babblement, but the aforesaid knew the real state of the case and did not pay attention to his words, but advanced with the foot of valour. That abandoned one, letting fall from his hand the thread of plan, neither planted the foot of intrepidity firmly for battle nor had the courage to defend the fort. After a slight struggle, and when many of his people had been slaughtered, he took to flight, and the forts of Mau\u2020 and Mahr\u012b (?), which were the chief reliance of that ill-fated man, were both taken without difficulty. A country\n\n* So in text, but ought to be the 17th.\n\u2020 Mau was a Himalayan fort. Blochmann, 345. The text has Mau u shahri, and so have the MSS. The Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma has Maud u Mahri, p. 124, and so has the Ma\u2019\u0101sir U., II. 178. Evidently from what follows there were two places, unless one was the fort and the other the city. See also T\u016bzuk, 304, 1. 10, which has pargana Maud Mahri. In the Ayin, Jarrett, II. 319, we have Mau and Nabah, and the next name in the list is Mahror. Gladwin has Mowd, and possibly we should translate \u201cMowd, a city on which he relied.\u201d\nwhich he had held by hereditary right from his fathers was trodden under foot by the victorious troops, and he became a wanderer and a vagabond. He retired to the ravines of the hills, and cast the dust of ruin and contempt on the head of his Fortune. R\u0101ja Bikram\u0101jit, leaving his country behind, hastened in pursuit of him with the victorious army. When the state of affairs reached the royal ears, in reward for this becoming service I ordered drums for the Raja, and a fateful farman was issued from the Sovereign of Wrath that they should overthrow from their foundation the fort and buildings that had been erected by S\u016braj Mal\u2019s father and himself, and leave not a trace of them on the face of the earth. A strange thing is that the unfortunate S\u016braj Mal had a brother called Jagat Singh. When I promoted S\u016braj Mal to the title of Raja, and made him an Amir, and gave him dominion, etc., without a partner or sharer, I, in order to please him, gave a small mansab to Jagat Singh, who did not get on well with him, and sent him to Bengal. This wretched one was passing his days in a poor condition far from his home, in contempt, and to the delight of his enemies, and waiting for some hidden aid, until by his good fortune this affair took place, and that unblessed one struck an axe on his own foot. Summoning Jagat Singh in all haste to Court, I honoured him with the title of Raja and the mansab of 1,000 personal and 500 horse, and bestowed 20,000 darbs* on him out of the public treasury for his expenses. Giving him a jewelled khapwa, a robe of honour, a horse, and an elephant, I sent him to R\u0101ja Bikram\u0101jit, and issued a farman that if the aforesaid, by the guidance of a good destiny, should perform laudable service, and display loyalty, that country should be given over into his hand.\u2020\n\nAs the praise of the garden of N\u016br-manzil and the buildings that had been newly-erected there continually reached me, I\n\n* The Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 125, says Rs. 20,000 which would be 40,000 darbs.\n\n\u2020 Jagat Singh afterwards became a rebel, joining Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n, as also did R\u0101ja Bikram\u0101jit, or Sundar. He rebelled also in Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n\u2019s reign, but was pardoned, and did good service in Kabul and Badakhshan. He died in Peshawar in 1055 (1645).

On the eve of Wednesday the garden of N\u016br-manzil (the abode of light) was adorned by the alighting of the hosts of prosperity. This garden contains 330 jar\u012bbs (bighas), according to the Il\u0101h\u012b gaz. Around it there has been built a wall, lofty and broad, of bricks and cement, exceedingly strong. In the garden there is a lofty building and a residence, highly decorated. Pleasant reservoirs have been constructed, and outside the gate a large well has been made, from which thirty-two pairs of bullocks continually draw water. The canal passes through the garden, and pours water into the reservoirs. Besides this, there are other wells, the water of which is distributed to the reservoirs and plots. The beauty is increased by all kinds of fountains and cascades and there is a tank in the exact middle of the garden which is filled by rainwater. If by chance its water should fail in the extreme heat, they supplement it by water from the wells, so that it may always be full to the brim. Nearly Rs. 150,000 have been spent up to now on this garden, and it is still unfinished, and large sums will be expended in making avenues and laying down plants. It has also been settled that the middle garden shall be newly walled* round, and the channels for the coming and going of the water shall be made so strong that it may always remain full of water and the water shall not leak out in any way, and no damage accrue. It is possible that before it is complete nearly Rs. 200,000 will have been spent on it.\n\nOn Thursday, the 24th, Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n presented an offering of jewels, jewelled vessels, cloths, an elephant, and a horse, of the value of Rs. 150,000. Having made a selection from them, I gave him the remainder. Until Saturday I passed my time in that garden of delight in enjoyment. On the eve of Sunday, the 27th, I inclined the reins of returning towards\n\n* It is hasr in text, but surely this is a mistake for hafir, and the meaning is that a new pit or well should be made in the middle of the garden.

On Monday, the 28th, I found that something had gone wrong with my eye. As it arose from too much blood, I ordered \u2018Al\u012b Akbar, the surgeon, to open a vein. On the next day the benefit of this was apparent. I bestowed Rs. 1,000 on him. On Tuesday, the 29th, Muqarrab K. came from his native place, and had the good fortune to kiss the threshold, and I favoured him with many sorts of kindness.\nTHE FOURTEENTH NEW YEAR'S FEAST FROM THE AUSPICIOUS ACCESSION\n\nOn the morning of Thursday, the 4th of the month of Rab\u012b\u2018u-l-akhir, Hijr\u012b 1028 (March 10, 1619), the world-enlightening sun entered his house of honour in Aries, and the fourteenth year of the reign of this suppliant commenced in all prosperity and happiness. On Thursday, the 1st of the New Year, my prosperous son, Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n, who is the star of the forehead of accomplished desires, and the brilliancy of the brow of prosperity, prepared a grand entertainment, and presented me as offerings with a selection of the precious things of the age, and rareties and curiosities of every country. One of these is a ruby, weighing 22 surkhs, of good colour, and water, and shape. The jewellers have valued it at Rs. 40,000. Another is a Qu\u1e6db\u012b* (?) ruby, in weight 3 t\u0101ns, and very delicate, valued at Rs. 40,000. Further, six pearls, one of them 1 t\u0101nk and 8 surkhs in weight. The Vakils of my son had bought it in Gujarat for Rs. 25,000, and the five others for Rs. 33,000. Also one diamond, the price of which was Rs. 18,000. Also a jewelled parda (sash), a sword-hilt made in his own goldsmith\u2019s shop; most of the jewels he had himself set and cut. He had brought great dexterity to bear on the design. Its value was fixed as Rs. 50,000. The designs\u2020 were his own; no one else had up to this day thought\n\n* Egyptian. Hitherto this has been read Qu\u1e6db\u012b, but it really is, I think, Qib\u1e6d\u012b, \u201cEgyptian.\u201d Chardin, IV. 70, ed. 1723, says that the Persians state that the ruby of the East comes from Egypt. The etymology, however, is doubtful.\n\n\u2020 Possibly the praise of Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n\u2019s inventive powers refers to his arrangements for the orchestra. The kuwarga is defined in the Ain, Blochmann, 50, as a dam\u0101ma\u2014i.e., a large drum. See illustra-\nof them. Undoubtedly it was a fine piece of workmanship. There was also a pair of drums made of gold for playing the *mursal* (overture?) with a whole orchestra\u2014viz., *kunwarga*, *naqq\u0101ra*, *karan\u0101*, *surn\u0101*, etc.\u2014whatever was required for the *naqq\u0101ra-kh\u0101na* (music-hall) of great princes, and all made of silver. At the auspicious hour at which I had seated myself on the throne of success these were all sounded. The whole of them came to a value of Rs. 65,000. Another was a seat for riding an elephant, called by moderns a howdah (*hauda*), made of gold, worth Rs. 30,000. Beside this there were two large elephants and five elephant-trappings of the offerings of Qu\u1e6dbu-l-mulk, ruler of Golconda. The first elephant was named D\u0101d-i-Il\u0101h\u012b (the gift of God). As it entered the private elephant-house on New Year\u2019s Day, I gave it the name of *N\u016br-i-Naur\u016bz* (the Light of New Year\u2019s Day). In truth he is a grand elephant, and lacks nothing of size, beauty, and dignity. As he looked well to my eye, I mounted him and rode him into the courtyard of the palace. His value was fixed at Rs. 80,000, and the value of six* others at Rs. 20,000. Its golden trappings, consisting of golden chains, etc., my son had had made for the elephant *N\u016br-i-Naur\u016bz*, were worth Rs. 30,000. The second elephant, with silver housings, was also presented, with Rs. 10,000 more in various choice jewels. The *kurkar\u0101qs\u2020* of my son had also prepared and sent delicate cloths from Gujarat. If all details were to be written, it would take too long. Briefly, the whole of his offerings was of the value of Rs. 450,000. It is hoped that he will eat the fruit of long life and prosperity.\n\n---\n\n* MS. No. 181 has ten instead of two as the number of elephants presented by Qu\u1e6dbu-l-mulk, and this seems likely to be correct, else where do the six now mentioned come from? But six should probably be eight.\n\n\u2020 Kurkar\u0101qs. See Blochmann, 87, n. 2, and p. 616. Kurk means fur, and kurkar\u0101q\u0101n may be translated furriers.\nOn Friday, the 2nd, Shaj\u0101\u02bfat K. \u2018Arab, and N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn Qul\u012b, the kotwal, laid their offerings before me. On Saturday, the 3rd, D\u0101r\u0101b K., son of the Kh\u0101n-kh\u0101n\u0101n, and on Sunday, the 4th, Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n, prayed to be allowed to entertain me. Out of the latter\u2019s offerings I accepted one pearl, bought for Rs. 20,000, with other rarities, altogether of the value of Rs. 130,000, and presented him with the rest. On Monday, the 5th, R\u0101ja Kishan D\u0101s and \u1e24\u0101kim K., on Tuesday, the 6th, Sard\u0101r K., and on Wednesday, the 7th, Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 K. and Am\u0101nat K., presented their offerings. From each of these I took a trifle in order to dignify them. On Thursday, the 8th, I\u2019tim\u0101du-d-daula, Mad\u0101r-ul-mulk (the pivot of the country), having prepared a royal entertainment, begged to be allowed to receive me. In accepting this request his standing was raised. In fact, in decorating the assembly and the largeness of his offering, he had exceeded himself, and made many decorations, and illuminated all sides of the lake as far as the eye could reach, and decorated the streets both near and far with all kinds of lights and coloured lanterns. Among the offerings of that Mad\u0101r-us-salt\u0101na there was a throne of gold and silver, much ornamented and decorated, the supports of which were in the form of tigers. It had been completed with great assiduity in the space of three years, and was made at the cost of Rs. 450,000. This throne had been made by a skilful European of the name of Hunarmand (skilful), who had no rival in the arts of a goldsmith and a jeweller, and in all sorts of skill (hunarmand\u012b). He had made it very well, and I gave him this name. In addition to the offerings he had brought for me, he offered the value of Rs. 100,000 in jewelled ornaments and cloths to the Begams and other ladies of the Palace. Without exaggeration, from the beginning of the reign of the late king (may the light of Allah be his testimony!) until now, which is the fourteenth year of the rule of this suppliant, not one of the great Amirs has presented such offerings. In fact, what comparison is there between him and others?\n\nOn this day Ikr\u0101m K., s. Isl\u0101m K. was honoured with the mansab, original and increased, of 2,000 personal and 1,000\nhorse, and An\u012br\u0101\u2019\u012b Singh-dalan with that of 2,000 personal and 1,600 horse, original and increased. On Friday, the 9th, I\u2019tib\u0101r K. presented his offering, and on the same day Kh\u0101n Daur\u0101n, having been presented with a horse and an elephant, took leave to go to the government of Patna.* His mansab, according to a previous rule, was fixed at 6,000 personal and 5,000 horse. On Saturday, the 10th, F\u0101zil K., on Sunday, the 11th, M\u012br M\u012br\u0101n, on Monday, the 12th, I\u2019tiq\u0101d K., on Tuesday, the 13th, T\u0101t\u0101r K. and An\u012br\u0101\u2019\u012b Singh-dalan, and on Wednesday, the 14th, M\u012brz\u0101 R\u0101j\u0101 Bh\u0101o Singh, presented their offerings. Selecting from them what was delicate and new, I gave the remainder to them. On Thursday, the 15th, \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n prepared a grand assembly and a royal entertainment in his own house, which is a very fine and pleasant place, and begged to be allowed to receive me. At his request, giving him the dignity of acceptance, I went there with the ladies. That pillar of the kingdom looked on this as a bounty from the secret Giver, and in the increase of his offering and preparation of the entertainment displayed great magnificence. Of jewels of great price and delicate gold brocades and all sorts of gifts, that which was approved was selected, and I presented him with the remainder. Among the offerings was a ruby weighing $12\\frac{1}{2}$ t\u0101ns, which was bought for Rs. 125,000. The value of the offerings that were accepted was Rs. 167,000. On this day Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n was raised to the mansab of 5,000 personal and 2,500 horse.\n\nLashkar K., having come, by order, from the Deccan, had the honour of waiting on me. As I had determined, after the rainy season had passed and in the beginning of the good weather, to go to the perpetual spring garden of Kashmir under the favour of Almighty God, it seemed right to me that the guardianship and administration of the fort and city of Agra and the faujdarship of the district, after the manner in which they had been held by Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n, should be entrusted to Lashkar K., and I honoured him with the good news Am\u0101nat K. was entrusted with the duty of superintendent of\n\n* So in text, but it should be Tatta\u2014i.e., Sind. See Blochmann 378, n. 2, and also the T\u016bzuk, infra, p. 275.\nbranding (of horses) and of parading the troopers.* On Friday, the 16th, Khw\u0101ja Ab\u016b-l-\u1e24asan, Chief Bakhsh\u012b, on Saturday, the 17th, \u0160\u0101diq K. Bakhsh\u012b, on Sunday, the 18th, Ir\u0101dat K., Chief Butler, and on Monday, the 19th, which was the day of the sun\u2019s culmination, \u2018A\u1e93udu-d-daula K., presented offerings, and I accepted from each of them, by way of exalting their dignity, what I approved. At this New Year the value of the accepted offerings of the servants of the Court came to Rs. 2,000,000. On the day of culmination I conferred on my auspicious son Sult\u0101n Parwiz\u2020 the mansab of 20,000 personal and 10,000 horse, original and increased. I\u2019tim\u0101du-d-daula was promoted to that of 7,000 personal and horse. I selected \u2018A\u1e93udu-d-daula for the duty of tutor to the pupil of the eye of the Sultanate, Sh\u0101h Shuj\u0101\u2018. I hope that he (the latter) may endure for his natural term of life and may be one of the prosperous ones. Q\u0101sim K. was raised to the mansab of 1,500 personal and 500 horse, and B\u0101qir K. to that of 1,000 personal and 400 horse. As Mah\u0101bat K. had asked for reinforcements, I appointed 500 A\u1e25ad\u012b horse to Bangash, and presented \u2018Izzat K., who had done approved service in that province, with a horse and a jewelled khapwa. At this time \u2018Abdu-s-Satt\u0101r\u2021 presented as an offering a compendium in the handwriting of the late king Hum\u0101y\u016bn (may the lights of Allah be his testimony!), containing some prayers, an introduction to the science of astronomy, and other marvellous things, most of which he had studied and carried into practice. After reverently inspecting his auspicious handwriting, I felt a joy such as I had seldom experienced. I was exceedingly rejoiced, for, by God, no precious thing I have can be compared with this. In return I increased his mansab beyond what he had imagined possible, and gave him a present of Rs. 1,000.\n\n* Suw\u0101r\u0101n-i-khud-mahalla. I do not know the exact force of the last two words. Possibly they are pleonastic. The word mahalla is explained in Irvine A. of M. 46.\n\n\u2020 The Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 127, mentions that Parw\u012bz came from Allahabad to pay his respects. See infra, T\u016bzuk, 268, and 273.\n\n\u2021 Probably this is the friend of Father Jerome Xavier and the abridger of the Zafar-n\u0101ma. See Rieu, 177b and 1077a.\nthe jewelled throne, I presented with 3,000 darb, a horse and an elephant. I gave Rs. 1,000 to Khw\u0101ja Kh\u0101wand Ma\u1e25m\u016bd, who is a pilgrim of the Path of the Khw\u0101jas, and is not void of dervishism and spirituality. Lashkar K. was promoted to the mansab of 3,000 personal and 2,000 horse, Ma\u02bfm\u016br K. to that of 900 personal and 450 horse, Khw\u0101jag\u012b T\u0101hir to that of 800 personal and 300 horse, and Sayyid Ahmad Q\u0101dir\u012b to that of 800 and 60 horse. On R\u0101ja S\u0101rang Deo was conferred the mansab of 700 personal and 30 horse, on M\u012br Khalil-u-llah, s. \u2018Azudu-d-daula, that of 600 personal and 250 horse, on the eunuch Fir\u016bz K., that of 600 and 150 horse, on Khidmat Kh\u0101n that of 550 and 130 horse, on Ma\u1e25ram K. that of 500 and 120 horse, on \u2018Izzat K. that of 600 personal and 100 horse, on R\u0101y New\u0101l\u012b D\u0101s, the accountant of the elephant department, that of 600 personal and 120 horse, on R\u0101y M\u0101n\u012b D\u0101s, the superintendent of the Palace, that of 600 personal and 100 horse, on Nathmal and Jagmal, sons of Kishan Singh, that of 500 and 225 horse each. If the increase of mansab given to those of less than 500 were to be written in full it would be too long. Rs. 2,000 were given to Khizr K., who belonged* to Khandesh.\n\nOn Wednesday, the 21st, I went to Am\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d for the purpose of sport. Some days before this, in accordance with orders, Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n, and Qiy\u0101m K., the head huntsman, had chosen a wide plain for a qamargha hunt, and drawn an enclosure round it, and driven within it many antelope from the neighbouring plains. As I had vowed that I would hereafter not kill any living thing with my own hand, it occurred to me to take them all alive, and place them within the Chaug\u0101n (polo-ground) of Fathpur, so that I might both enjoy the pleasure of sport and that at the same time no harm should happen to them. I accordingly took 700 head and sent them to Fathpur. As the hour for entering the capital was near, I ordered R\u0101y M\u0101n, khidmatiyya,\u2020 to put up a screen on two sides, like a lane, from the hunting-\n\n* He was of the royal house of Khandesh.\n\u2020 See Blochmann, 252, and n. 1. Jah\u0101ng\u012br himself saw 700 antelope taken, and R\u0101y M\u0101n afterwards made a drive of 800 more.\nplace to the plain of Fathpur, and to drive the antelope there. About 800 antelope were sent in this way, or altogether 1,500. On the night of Wednesday, the 28th, marching from Am\u0101n\u0101-b\u0101d, I halted in B\u016bst\u0101n Sar\u0101y, and on the eve of Thursday, the 29th, I halted at the N\u016br-manzil garden.\n\nOn Friday, the 30th, the mother* of Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n attained the mercy of God. The next day I myself went to the house of that precious son, and having condoled with him in every way, took him with me to the palace. On Sunday, the 1st Urdibihisht, at the auspicious hour chosen by the astrologers and astronomers, I mounted a special elephant of the name of Dil\u012br, and in all prosperity and happiness entered the city. A great crowd of people, men and women, had collected together in the streets and bazaars, and at the gates and walls, expecting me. According to custom, I went on, scattering money on the way, to inside the palace. From the date on which the army of prosperity started for this happily terminated journey until now, when I returned in happiness and good fortune, it was five years, seven months, and nine days. At this time I ordered my son Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Parw\u012bz that, as a long time had passed during which he had been deprived of waiting on me personally, or had been fortunate enough to pay his respects, if he were desirous of meeting me, he should come to Court. On the arrival of the gracious farm\u0101n, that son, considering the manifestation of this favour a gift from the hidden world, turned the face of his hope towards the sphere-resembling Court. At this time I gave away, as a means of livelihood, to Faqirs and deserving people 44,786 bighas of land, and two entire villages, with 320 ass-loads (kharw\u0101r, a weight) of grain from Kashmir, and seven ploughs\u2020 of land in Kabul. I hope that the Grace of the Bestower of desires and benevolence may be their daily lot.\n\n* This was Jodh B\u0101\u2019i, d. the Mota (fat) R\u0101ja. See Blochmann, 619.\n\n\u2020 Qulba, ploughs. Here apparently used as a measure of land. But the expression is obscure. In Wilson\u2019s Glossary \u1e33ulb\u0101 is stated to be a measure of land in Sylhet, and equal to 1,008 cubits by 144. The corresponding Sanskrit word Sir (\u201ca plough\u201d) is used to mean land held by the landholder in his own possession.\nOne of the occurrences of this time is the revolt of All\u0101hd\u0101d, son of Jal\u0101l, the Afghan. The details of this are that when Mah\u0101bat K. obtained leave to go and take possession of Bangash and overthrow the Afghans, from an idea that that wretch would do some service in return for the favours and kindness I had conferred on him, he prayed that he might take him with him. As the natural tendency of such ungrateful men, who do not recognize what is right, tends to enmity and malevolence, by way of precaution it was decided to send his son and brother to the Court that they might be as hostages. After the arrival there of his son and brother, I, by way of comforting them, did them all kinds of kindness, but, as they have said:\n\n\"The blanket of fortune of anyone that has been woven black\nCannot be whitened even by the waters of Zamzam and Kau\u1e63ar.\"\n\nFrom the day on which he arrived in that country the signs of rascality and want of recognition of the right began to be apparent on the cheeks of his affairs, and Mah\u0101bat K., in order to control matters, did not loose from his hand the rope of forbearance until, at this time, he sent a force under the leadership of his son against a band of Afghans, and sent All\u0101hd\u0101d with him. When they reached the purposed place, from the enmity and malevolence of the aforesaid, that attack did not succeed, and they returned with their aim uncompleted. The evil-dispositioned All\u0101hd\u0101d, from a suspicion lest this time Mah\u0101bat K. should abandon his method of conciliation, and ascertain the real state of affairs, and that he should be caught in recompense for his evil deeds, lifted up the veil of reverence, and betrayed involuntarily the faithlessness to his salt, which he had till then concealed. When I heard from Mah\u0101bat K.'s letter the true state of affairs, I ordered them to imprison his son and brother in the fort of Gwalior. As it had happened (Jal\u0101l T\u0101r\u012bk\u012b), the father of this wretch had also fled from the service of the late king, and for years passed his time in thieving and highway robbery, until he was caught in the recompense of his own evil deeds. It is hoped that this rascal will also soon obtain the reward of his bad actions.\nOn Thursday, the 5th, M\u0101n Singh, s. R\u0101wat Shankar, who was one of the auxiliaries of Bihar, was promoted to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 600 horse. I sent off \u0100qil K. to look after the cavalry,* and inquire into the corps of the mansabdars who had been appointed for duty in Bangash, and gave him an elephant. I sent as a gift to Mah\u0101bat K. a private dagger made after the Mazandar\u0101n fashion, along with D\u016bst Beg. The offering of Monday was given as a present to Mahm\u016bd \u0100b-d\u0101r, who from the time when I was a prince and the days of my childhood had served me. Mir\u0101n (not Bizan,\u2020 as in the printed book), son-in-law of P\u0101yanda K. Moghul, was promoted to the mansab of 700 personal and 450 horse. Muhammad \u1e24usain, brother of Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n, who was Bakhshi of Kangra, was promoted to the mansab of 600 personal and 450 horse. On this day Tarbiyat K., who is one of the hereditary houseborn ones of this Court, and had been enrolled among the Amirs by reason\u2021 of his good disposition, died. He was not devoid of sluggishness (n\u0101-mur\u0101d\u012b, literally want of desires) and self-indulgence (sal\u0101mat-i-nafs), and was a young man fond of pleasure ('ayy\u0101sh-taib\u012b'). He wished to pass his whole life at ease, and was devoted to Hindu music and did not understand it badly. He was a man void of evil.\n\nR\u0101ja S\u016braj Singh was raised to the mansab of 2,000 personal and horse. To Karamu-llah, s. 'Al\u012b Mard\u0101n K. Bah\u0101dur, B\u0101qir K., Faujdar of Multan, Malik Muljibb Afghan, and Makt\u016bb K. were given elephants. Sayyid B\u0101yaz\u012bd Bhakkari, to whom was entrusted the charge of the fort of Bhakkar and the faujdarship of that region, was also honoured with an\n\n* Mahalla. Here used apparently for musters.\n\u2020 Mr. Rogers corrects this to Mir\u0101n on the authority of R.A.S., MS. It is, however, Bizhan in I.O. MS., 181, and as Blochmann points out, Bizan or Bizhan is twice referred to in the T\u016bzuk, pp. 307, 309. He was son of N\u0101d 'Al\u012b Maid\u0101n\u012b.\n\u2021 I.O. MS. has \"by favour of my rearing\" (tarbiyat) and probably the words in text rather mean that he was promoted by virtue of Jah\u0101ng\u012br's liking for him, than that he was of good disposition. His real name was 'Abdu-r-Rah\u012bm. He was the son of Q\u0101'im K., and his sister S\u0101liha B\u0101n\u016b was one of Jah\u0101ng\u012br's wives, and had the title of P\u0101dish\u0101h-Mahall. Blochmann, 371. Before Nur-Jah\u0101n she was the chief wife.\nelephant. Am\u0101nu-llah, s. Mah\u0101bat K. was distinguished with the gift of a jewelled dagger. I gave elephants to Shaikh Ahmad H\u0101ns\u012b, Shaikh \u2018Abdu-l-La\u1e6d\u012bf Sambhal\u012b, the eunuch Fir\u0101sat K., and R\u0101y Kunwar Chand Mustaufi (auditor). Mu\u1e25ammad Shafi\u2018 Bakhshi of the Panjab, was raised to the mansab of 500 personal and 300 horse. The mansab of 500 personal and 150 horse was conferred on M\u016bnis, s. Mihtar* K. He (M\u016bnis) had charge of the fort of K\u0101linjar.\n\nOn this day arrived the news of the death of Sh\u0101h-naw\u0101z K. s. the Commander-in-Chief Kh\u0101n Kh\u0101n\u0101n. It was the cause of distress of mind to me. At the time when that \u0100t\u0101liq (Kh\u0101n Kh\u0101n\u0101n) took leave from waiting on me, it had been strictly impressed upon him that, as it had been repeatedly brought to my ear that Sh\u0101h-naw\u0101z K. had been maddened with wine and drank immoderately, if there was truth in this it was a pity that he should destroy himself at his age. It was necessary that he should not leave him to his own way, but look after his case properly. If he could not leave his charge himself, he should write a clear report, so that, having summoned him into my presence, I might give the best order practicable under the circumstances. When he arrived at Burhanpur, having found Sh\u0101h-naw\u0101z Kh\u0101n very weak and low, he tried to make some remedy for him. After some days\u2019 confinement to bed (literally, lord of the carpet) he fell on the couch of powerlessness. Whatever remedies and plans the physicians employed were of no avail, and in the best time of his youth and prosperity, in the thirty-third year of his age, to the sorrow and grief of the world, he went to the place of the mercy and pardon of God. On hearing this unpleasant news I was greatly grieved, for in truth he was an intelligent youth and born in the house. He would have performed important services in this State, and left great traces behind him. Although this road is before all, and there is no escape for anyone out of the command of destiny, yet it appears sad to depart in this fashion. It is hoped he will be among those who are pardoned. I sent R\u0101ja S\u0101rang Deo, who was\n\n* Mihtar K. was a very old servant, and died in the third year of Jahangir.

The mansab of 5,000 held by Sh\u0101h-naw\u0101z I added on to those of his brothers and sons. To D\u0101r\u0101b, his younger brother, I gave the mansab of 5,000 personal, original and increased, and presented him with a dress of honour, an elephant, a horse, and a jewelled sword, and gave him leave to go to his father to fill, in place of Sh\u0101h-naw\u0101z, the post of governor of Berar and Ahmadnagar. Rahm\u0101n-d\u0101d, another brother, I promoted to the mansab of 2,000 and 800 horse. Man\u016bchahr, s. Sh\u0101h-naw\u0101z, was given the mansab of 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse. \u1e6caghzal (Toghril ?), s. Sh\u0101h-naw\u0101z* K. was promoted to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 500 horse. On Thursday, the 12th, Q\u0101sim K., son-in-law of I\u2019tim\u0101du-d-daula, was honoured with the favour of a standard. Asadu-llah, s. Sayyid H\u0101ji, who had come with the intention of obtaining service, had the mansab bestowed on him of 500 personal and 100 horse. \u1e62adr Jah\u0101n, son-in-law of the deceased Murta\u1e93\u0101 K., received that of 700 personal and 600 horse, and was appointed to the faujdarship of Sambhal, and, having had an elephant bestowed on him, I gave him leave. Bh\u0101rat Band\u012bla was also presented with the mansab of 600 personal and 400 horse, and had an elephant given him, and an elephant was bestowed on Sangr\u0101m, the Raja of Jammu.\n\nIn Ahmadabad I had two male m\u0101rkh\u016br goats. As I had not a female in my establishment to pair with them, it occurred to me that if I could pair them with Barbary goats, which they bring from Arabia, especially from the port of the city of Darkhar,\u2020 young of their form and qualities might be obtained. In short, I paired them with seven Barbary ewes, and after six months had elapsed each of the latter had a young one at Fathpur: there were four females and three males, very pleasing in appearance, of good shape and good colour. In their colour, those (kids) which resembled the\n\n* Text wrongly has Sh\u0101h N\u016br.\n\u2020 This is the ancient Dhafur or Dofar on the south coast of Arabia now known as Mirb\u0101\u1e6d.

Red,* indeed, appears to me a more pleasing colour than any other, and it is the mark of a better breed. Of their liveliness and laughable ways and their manner of gamboling and leaping, what can be written? Some of their ways are such that the mind derived uncontrolled pleasure from looking at them. It is notorious that painters cannot draw properly the motions of a kid. Granting that they may chance to draw the movements of an ordinary kid after a fashion, they certainly would have to acknowledge themselves at a loss how to draw the motions of these kids. When one month, or even twenty days old, they would leap up upon high places and throw themselves on to the ground in a way that if any other but a kid were to do so, not one limb would be left whole. As it pleased me, I ordered them always to be kept near me, and I gave each of them an appropriate name. I am much delighted with them, and pay great attention to bringing together *m\u0101rkh\u016br* males and well-bred she-goats. I desire to have many young ones from them, and that they may become well known among men. After their young shall have paired, most probably more delicate ones will be obtained. One of their peculiarities is that ordinary kids immediately they are born, and until they begin to suck, make a great bleating, whilst these, on the contrary, make no sound, and stand quite contented and without wailing. Perhaps their flesh would be very pleasant to the taste.\n\nBefore this, an order had been given that Muqarrab K., having been appointed to Bihar, should hasten off there. He came to Court in order to pay his respects before he repaired to his destination, and accordingly, on Thursday, the 2nd Kh\u016brd\u0101d, an elephant with trappings, two horses, and a jewelled *khapwa* were conferred on him, and he took leave. Rs. 50,000 were given him as an advance of pay. On the same day Sard\u0101r Kh\u0101n received a dress of honour, an elephant, and a horse, and obtained the Sarkar of Monghyr, which is in\n\n* The description is rather obscure. Apparently Jah\u0101ngir regards *bamand* (dun- or bay-coloured) as equal to red (*surkh*).\nthe province of Bihar and Bengal, and took leave. Mir Shar\u012bf,* the Vak\u012bl of Q\u016b\u1e6dbu-l-mulk, who was at Court, took leave. My fortunate son, Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n, sent with him the brother of Af\u1e93al K., his Diwan. As Q\u016b\u1e6dbu-l-mulk had shown attachment and desire to please, and repeatedly importuned me for a portrait, I presented him, at his request, with my likeness, a jewelled khapwa, and a ph\u016bl kal\u0101ra. 24,000 darb, a jewelled dagger, a horse, and a dress of honour were also given to the aforesaid Mir Shar\u012bf. F\u0101\u017cil K., director of buildings, was advanced to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 500 horse, and \u1e24ak\u012bm R\u0101gho N\u0101th to that of 600 personal and 60 horse. As at this time the anniversary of the late king (Akbar) occurred, Rs. 5,000 were handed over to some of my chief servants to divide among poor and deserving people. \u1e24asan \u2018Al\u012b K., jagirdar of the Sarkar of Monghyr, was honoured with the mansab of 2,500 personal and horse, and sent to the assistance of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm K. Fath-jang, governor of the province of Bengal, and he was presented with a sword. As M\u012brz\u0101 Sharafu-d-d\u012bn Husain K\u0101shghar\u012b sacrificed his life on duty in Bangash, I promoted his son Ibr\u0101h\u012bm \u1e2ausain to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 500 horse. At this time Ibr\u0101h\u012bm K. constructed two boats,\u2020 which in the language of the country they call Kosha, one of gold and the other of silver, and sent them to me by way of offering. Undoubtedly, of their own kind they are the finest. One of these I gave to my son Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n. On Thursday, the 9th, S\u0101d\u0101t K. was granted the mansab of 1,000 personal and 60 horse. On this day \u2018Azudu-d-daula and Shaj\u0101\u2018at K. \u2018Arab took leave for their jagirs. On this Thursday I presented \u0100\u1e63af K. with a jewelled khapwa and a ph\u016bl kal\u0101ra. As my fortunate son Sult\u0101n Parw\u012bz proposed to come to Court, he asked for a special n\u0101dir\u012b dress of honour, a ch\u012bra, and a fota, so that he might wear them and be distinguished on the day of meeting me and of having the good fortune to pay his respects. According to his request, I sent by the hand of his Vakil, Shar\u012bf,\n\n* Text has Mushrif.\n\u2020 D\u016b manzil kisht\u012b must surely mean \u201ctray\u201d here; or perhaps they were models.

On Thursday, the 23rd, M\u012brz\u0101 W\u0101l\u012b, son of the aunt of this suppliant, came by order from the Deccan, and had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. His father, Khw\u0101ja \u1e24asan Kh\u0101ld\u0101r (the freckled ?), was one of the Naqshband\u012b Khw\u0101jas. My uncle, M\u012brz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24ak\u012bm, gave his sister in marriage to the Khw\u0101ja. I heard much praise of the Khw\u0101ja from people: he had both good family and got on well with every one, and for a long time the management of the affairs of my uncle M\u012brz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24ak\u012bm had been in his hands, and he was on very good terms with him. Before the M\u012brz\u0101\u2019s death he had himself delivered* over the deposit of his life. Two sons survived him\u2014viz., M\u012brz\u0101 Bad\u012b\u02bfu-z-zam\u0101n and M\u012brz\u0101 W\u0101l\u012b. M. Badi\u02bfu-z-zam\u0101n, after the death of the M\u012brz\u0101, ran away, and went to M\u0101-war\u0101\u02bea-n-nahr (Transoxania), and in that exile became a traveller on the road of non-existence. The Begam and M\u012brz\u0101 W\u0101l\u012b came to the glorious Court, and H.M. (Akbar) behaved very kindly to the Begam. The M\u012brz\u0101 also is a steady and sedate young man, not devoid of reasonableness and understanding. He is very skilled in the science of music. At this time it occurred to me to marry the daughter of the deceased Prince D\u0101niy\u0101l to the M\u012brz\u0101, and my reason for sending for the M\u012brz\u0101 to Court was this. This girl (Bul\u0101q\u012b Begam) is the offspring of the daughter of Qilij Mu\u1e25ammad K. It is hoped that the grace of striving to please and to serve, which is the means of good fortune and prosperity, may be his (M. W\u0101l\u012b\u2019s) lot and fortune.\n\nOn this day Sarbuland R\u0101y, who had been sent on duty to the Deccan, was promoted to the mansab of 2,500 personal and 1,500 horse.\n\nAt this time it was reported to me that a Shayy\u0101d (a loud talker, a cheat) of the name of Shaikh\u2020 Ahmad had spread the\n\n* Apparently Khw\u0101ja \u1e24asan died in Badakhsh\u0101n.

He is mentioned in Beale as Ahmad Sirhind\u012b (Shaikh), and as having had the title of Mujaddid-i-Alf-i-\u1e62\u0101n\u012b, because he believed that he was the man of the second millenium. In other words, he claimed to be a Mahd\u012b. He was s. 'Abdu-l-W\u0101\u1e25id F\u0101r\u016bq\u012b, and born in 1563. He died 29 November,\nnet of hypocrisy and deceit in Sirhind, and caught in it many of the apparent worshippers without spirituality, and had sent into every city and country one of his disciples, whom he called his deputy (khalifa), and whom he considered more skilled than others in the adorning of shops (of deceit) and selling of religious knowledge, and in deceiving men. He had also written a number of idle tales to his disciples and his believers, and had made them into a book which he called Makt\u016bb\u0101t (letters). In that album (Jung) of absurdities many unprofitable things had been written that drag (people) into infidelity and impiety. Amongst these he had written in a letter as follows: \u201cIn the course of my travels I had come to the dwelling of the Two Lights (the Sun and Moon), and saw a very lofty and very splendid building. From there I passed to the abode of Discrimination (F\u0101r\u016bq), and from there I passed to the abode of Truth (\u1e62idd\u012bq), and to each I wrote a suitable explanation (or perhaps, of each I wrote a suitable description). From there I reached the abode of Love, and I beheld a brilliant dwelling. It had divers colours and lights and reflected glories. That is to say (God forgive us!\u2014an exclamation of Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s), I passed from the abode of the Vicegerents (khulaf\u0101) and attained to the highest rank.\u201d There were other presumptuous expressions which it would be too long to write, and would be contrary to good manners. I according gave an order that they should bring him to the Court that is based on justice. According to order he came to pay his respects. To all that I asked him he could give no reasonable answer, and appeared to me to be extremely\n\n1624, and is buried at Sirhind. The I.G. new edition, XXIII. 21., says there are two tombs in Sirhind known as those of the Master and the Disciple, and it may be that one of them is S. A\u1e25mad\u2019s, although the Gazetteer says they probably belong to the fourteenth century. There is also a reference to him in Rieu\u2019s Catalogue, III. 1058a., fol. 16. He belonged to the Naqshbandi order, and one of his writings is called Majm\u016b\u2019at-ut-ta\u1e63awwuf. There is a very long account of him, and of his interviews with Jah\u0101ng\u012br in the Khaz\u012bnatu-l-Auliya, I. 607, etc. It is said there that he was imprisoned for two years, and then released, and that he died on the last day of \u1e62afar, 1035, November 20, 1625, at the age of sixty-three. Jah\u0101ng\u012br afterwards pardoned S. A\u1e25mad. See T\u016bzuk, 308, account of fifteenth year.\nproud and self-satisfied, with all his ignorance. I considered the best thing for him would be that he should remain some time in the prison of correction until the heat of his temperament and confusion of his brain were somewhat quenched, and the excitement of the people also should subside. He was accordingly handed over to Anir\u0101\u2019\u012b Singh-dalan to be imprisoned in Gwalior fort.\n\nOn Saturday, the 25th Kh\u016brd\u0101d, my fortunate son Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Parwiz came from Allahabad, and with prostration at the threshold of the Khalifate illuminated the forehead of sincerity. After he had performed the ceremony of kissing the ground and been honoured with special favour, I bade him sit. He presented 2,000 muhars and 2,000 rupees by way of nazr, and made an offering of a diamond. As his elephants had not yet arrived, he would produce them on another occasion. He had brought with him to the Court, which is the asylum of the world, R\u0101ja Kaly\u0101n, Zamindar of Ratanp\u016br, against whom this my son had by order sent an army, and had taken from him as an offering 80 elephants and Rs. 100,000. My son brought him with him, and he had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. Waz\u012br K., my son\u2019s Diwan who is one of the old servants of the Court, having had the good fortune to pay his respects to me, presented as offerings 28 elephants, male and female. Of these nine were accepted, and the rest bestowed on him.\n\nAs it had been represented to me that Muruwwat K., s. Iftikh\u0101r K., who was one born and bred up at this Court, had fought with a band of Maghs on the borders of Bengal and had sacrificed his life, I promoted All\u0101h-y\u0101r, his brother, to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 500 horse, and another brother to that of 400 personal and horse, so that those he had left behind should not be distressed. On Monday, the 3rd of the Divine month of T\u012br, in the neighbourhood of the city four black bucks, a doe, and a fawn were taken. As I passed by the house of my fortunate son, Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Parwiz, he presented two tusked elephants with their trappings by way of offering; both were ordered to be placed in the private elephant-stud.\n\nOn Thursday, the 13th, Sayyid \u1e24asan, the ambassador of\nmy happy brother, Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s, ruler of Persia, having had the good fortune to kiss the threshold, produced a letter, together with a crystal drinking-cup, on the cover of which was a ruby. As it was given from excessive friendship and sincerity it was the cause of the increase of amity and good fellowship. On this day Fid\u0101\u2019i K. was promoted to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 500 horse, and Na\u1e63ru-llah, s. Fathu-llah, in whose charge was the fort of Ambar, that of 1,500 personal and 400 horse. On Thursday, the 20th, Am\u0101nu-llah, s. Mah\u0101bat K., was promoted to the mansab of 1,500 personal and 800 horse. Having conferred on Waz\u012br K. the Diwanship of Bengal, I gave him a horse, a dress of honour, and a jewelled dagger. Elephants were given to Mir \u1e24us\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn and Zabar-dast K. On this day \u1e24\u0101fi\u1e93 \u1e24asan, a servant of Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam, came to Court with a precious letter from my brother Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s, and a report from that pillar of the Sultanate (Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam). He laid before me a dagger the hilt of which was made of a fish\u2019s* tooth spotted with black, that my brother had given to Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam. As it was a great rarity, he (Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam) had sent it to me. I greatly approved of it; in fact, it is a rare present. I had never seen a spotted one until now, and I was much pleased.\n\nOn Thursday, the 27th, M. W\u0101li was promoted to the mansab of 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse. On the 24th, I gave 1,000 darbs as a present to Sayyid \u1e24asan, the ambassador, and an elephant to \u2018Abdu-llah K. Bah\u0101dur Fir\u016bz-jang. On Thursday, the 2nd of the Divine month of Amurd\u0101d, a horse was presented to I\u2019tib\u0101r K. \u2018\u0100qil K. was promoted to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 800 horse.\n\nOn the night of Saturday, the 4th of the Il\u0101h\u012b month of Amurd\u0101d, corresponding with 15 Sha\u2018b\u0101n, was the feast of the Shab-i-bar\u0101t. By order, they decorated and brought\n\n* Dand\u0101n-i-m\u0101h\u012b, explained in dictionary as the canine tooth of the Walrus (Trichechus rosmarus). But there is nothing black or piebald about walrus-teeth, and Jah\u0101ng\u012br would surely not admire greatly a kind of ivory which was inferior to that of the elephant. I incline to think that what is here meant is tortoise-shell.

In truth, the lamps they had arranged appeared very pretty, and for a long time I enjoyed myself in going round and looking at them. On Tuesday, M\u012br\u0101n,* s. N\u0101d \u2018Al\u012b Maid\u0101n\u012b, who was one of the well-brought-up khanazads, was selected for the mansab of 700 personal and 500 horse, and Khw\u0101ja Zainu-d-d\u012bn for that of 700 personal and 300 horse, and Khw\u0101ja Muhsin for that of 700 personal and 100 horse. On Thursday, the 9th, I went to hunt at the village of Sam\u016bnagar. Passing my time pleasantly in going round and hunting on that pleasant plain until Monday, I returned on the eve of Tuesday to the palace. On Thursday, the 16th, Bish\u016btan, grandson of Shaikh Ab\u016b-l-Fa\u017cl (the author), was promoted to the mansab of 700 personal and 350 horse. On this day I went round to see the garden of Gul-afsh\u0101n, which is on the bank of the Jumna. On the way rain fell heavily and filled the mead with freshness and greenness. Pineapples had arrived at perfection, and I made a thorough inspection. Of the buildings that overlooked the river none\u2020 that I saw were without the charm of verdure and flowing water. These verses of Anw\u0101r\u012b appeared appropriate to the place:\n\nVerse.\n\n\"'Tis a day of mirth and jollity,\nA daily market of flowers and odours:\nThe earth-heaps are suffused with ambergris,\nThe zephyr sheds rose-water from his skirt,\nFrom contact with the morning breeze the pool\nIs roughened and pointed, like the edge of a file.\"\n\nAs this garden is in the charge of Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n, he presented me as offerings with some pieces of brocade of a new fashion they had lately brought for him from Ir\u0101q. Selecting what I approved of, I presented the remainder to him. He had arranged the garden well, and his mansab was ordered to be raised to 5,000 personal and 3,000 horse, original and increased.\n\n* Apparently M\u012br\u0101n is a mistake for B\u012bzhan. See ante and Blochmann, 508, and Tuzuk, 307. It is B\u012bzan in I.O. MS., 181.\n\n\u2020 The buildings referred to are the garden-houses made by Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n in the N\u016br-manzil garden.\nA strange circumstance was that I was so much delighted with a jewelled dagger-hilt of piebald teeth which Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam had got from Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s and sent to me (see ante), that I appointed several skilful men to go to Ir\u0101n and T\u016br\u0101n to look for them and to be consistently searching for them, and to bring some from anywhere and any person, anyhow, and at any price. Many of my servants who knew my disposition, and dignified Am\u012brs in the course of their duty, engaged in the search. It happened that in this city a stupid stranger bought in the open bazaar a coloured tooth of great beauty and delicacy for a trifle; he believed that some time or other it had fallen into the fire, and that the black on it was the mark of burning! After some time he showed it to one of the carpenters on the establishment of my prosperous son Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n, desiring that he should take off a piece of the tooth in order to make a ring (shast), and pointed out that he should remove the marks of burning and the blacknesses, being ignorant that the blackness enhanced the value and price of the whiteness. Those moles and patches were what the tirewoman of destiny had given as an adornment of its beauty. The carpenter at once went to the Superintendent of his workshop, and gave him the good news that such a rare and precious thing, in search of which people were wandering and going long distances, and hastening to all corners and in all directions in various countries, had fallen for nothing into the hands of an ignorant man, who did not know its value. It could be easily and cheaply obtained from him. The Superintendent went off with him and immediately procured it, and next day produced it before my son. When my son Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n came to wait on me, he at first showed great delight, and after his brain had become free from the intoxication of the wine of joy, produced it, and greatly pleased me\u2014\n\n**VERSE.**\n\n\u201cThy Time is happy in that thou hast made mine happy.\u201d\n\nI invoked so many blessings on him that if one of them out of a hundred obtain acceptance, it will suffice for his spiritual and material well-being.\nOn this day Bahl\u012bm K., one of the chief servants of \u2018\u0100dil K. came and waited on me. As he had chosen my service out of sincerity, I bestowed on him unstinted favours, and presented him with a dress of honour, a horse, a sword, and 10,000 darbs, with the mansab of 1,000 personal and 500 horse. At this time a petition came from Kh\u0101n Daur\u0101n, stating that: \u201cYour Majesty, from the perfection of kindness and knowledge of his worth, had appointed to the government of Thatta (Sind) an old slave, notwithstanding his great age and weak sight. As this weak old man was exceedingly bent and decrepit, and had not in him the ability to exert himself or to ride, he prays that he may be excused military service, and that he may be enrolled in the army of prayer.\u201d At his request, I ordered the chief Diwans to confirm him in the pargana of Khush\u0101b,* with a revenue of 3,000,000 of d\u0101ms, and which he for a long time had held as a tankhw\u0101h jagir, and which had become peopled and cultivated, by way of providing for his expenses, so that he might pass his time in easy circumstances. His eldest son, by name Sh\u0101h Mu\u1e25ammad, was promoted to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 600 horse, his second son, Ya\u2018q\u016bb Beg, obtaining that of 700 personal and 350 horse. The third son, Asad Beg, was promoted to the mansab of 300 personal and 50 horse.\n\nOn Saturday, the 1st of the Divine month of Shahriwar, I sent dresses of honour for the rainy season to the \u0100t\u0101liq Commander-in-Chief Kh\u0101n-kh\u0101n\u0101n J\u0101n-sip\u0101r and the other great Amirs, who had been sent on duty to the Deccan, by the hand of Yazd\u0101n.\u2020\n\nAs the purpose of visiting the eternal spring of the rose-garden of Kashmir was settled in my mind, I sent off N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn Qul\u012b to hasten on before, to repair as far as was possible the ups and downs of the Punch\u2021 route to it, and to prepare\n\n* See Jarrett, II. 323; it was near the Jhelam. See also I.G., new edition, XV. 297. It is in the Sh\u0101hp\u016br district. The land-revenue of it was 2\u00b74 lakhs of rupees in 1903-1904. 30 lakhs of d\u0101ms would be equal to Rs. 75,000. Kh\u0101n Daur\u0101n\u2019s name was Sh\u0101h Beg K. The Ma\u2018\u0101sir says his resignation was not altogether voluntary.

See Jarrett, II. 347, n. 3.\nit, so that the passage of laden beasts over difficult hilltops might be accomplished with ease, and that the men should not undergo labour and hardship. A large number of artificers, such as stone-cutters, carpenters, spadesmen, etc., were despatched with him, to whom an elephant was also given. On the eve of Thursday, the 13th, having gone to the garden of N\u016br-manzil, I passed the time in enjoyment in that rose-garden of delight until Sunday, the 16th. R\u0101ja Bikram\u0101j\u012bt Baghela came from the fort of M\u0101ndp\u016br, which is his native place, and had the good fortune to kiss the threshold, and by way of offering presented an elephant and a jewelled plume. Maq\u1e63\u016bd K. was honoured with the mansab of 1,000 personal and 130 horse. On Thursday, the 20th, my son Sh\u0101h Parw\u012bz produced two elephants as an offering, and they were ordered to be included in the private stud. On the 24th of the aforesaid month the feast of the solar weighing took place in the palace of Maryamu-z-zam\u0101n\u012b, and my 51st year according to the solar months began in gladness and victory. It is hoped that the period of my life may be passed in obedience to God (to whom be glory!). To Sayyid Jal\u0101l, s. Sayyid Mu\u1e25ammad, the grandson (?) of Sh\u0101h \u2018\u0100lam Bukh\u0101r\u012b, an account of whom has been written among the events of my Gujarat expedition, I gave leave to return. I gave him a female elephant for his riding, as well as his expenses. On the eve of Sunday,* the 30th, corresponding with the 14th Shaww\u0101l, when the disk of the moon was perfect (at full moon) a moonlight feast was prepared in the buildings of the garden which overlook the River Jumna, and a very pleasant entertainment took place. On the 1st of the Divine month, out of the veined (jauhar-d\u0101r) spotted tooth (walrus) which my son Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n had given me as an offering, I ordered to be cut off sufficient for two dagger-hilts and a thumb-stall:\u2020 it came out of a beautiful colour and was very choice. I ordered the Ust\u0101ds (masters) P\u016bran and Kaly\u0101n, who had no rivals in the art of engraving,\u2021 to make dagger-hilts of a shape that\n\n* I.O. MSS. have Monday.\n\u2020 The word in text is shashsat. Shast is a thumbstall, but it may also mean a ring. See Blochmann, 166 and n. 1.\n\u2021 Kh\u0101tam-band\u012b. It also means \u201cinlaying.\u201d\nwas approved at this time, and has become known as the Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b fashion. At the same time the blade and the sheath and fastenings were given to skilful men, each of whom was unique in his age in his art. Truly, it was all carried out according to my wish. One hilt came out coloured in such a way as to create astonishment. It turned out of all the seven colours, and some of the flowers looked as if a skilful painter* had depicted them in black lines round it with a wonder-working pencil. In short, it was so delicate that I never wish it to be apart from me for a moment. Of all the gems of great price that are in the treasury I consider it the most precious. On Thursday I girded it auspiciously and with joy round my waist, and the masters who in their completion had exercised great skill and taken great pains were rewarded, Ust\u0101d P\u016bran with the gift of an elephant, a dress of honour, and a golden bracelet for the wrist, which the people of India call Kara,\u2020 and Kaly\u0101n with the title of \u2018Aj\u0101\u2019ib-dast (wondrous hand), and increased mansab, a dress of honour, and a jewelled bracelet (pah\u016bnch\u012b), and in the same way every one according to his circumstances and skill received favours.\n\nAs it had been represented to me that Am\u0101nu-llah, s. Mah\u0101bat K., having fought with the rebel A\u1e25d\u0101d, had defeated his army, and had made many of the Afghans\u2014who are black-faced and black-hearted\u2014the harvest of his blood-drinking sword, I sent him a special sword in order to dignify him.\n\nOn Saturday, the 5th, news came of the death of R\u0101ja S\u016braj Singh, who had died a natural death in the Deccan. He was the descendant of M\u0101ldeo, who was one of the principal Zamindars of Hindustan, and had a zamindari which equalled that of the R\u0101n\u0101, and he had even overcome him in one battle. There is a full account of him (M\u0101ldeo) in the Akbar-n\u0101ma. R\u0101ja S\u016braj Singh, through the advantage of his being brought up by the late king (Akbar), and this suppliant\n\n* Bandu b\u0101n. In I.O. MSS. it is bandu b\u0101r\u0101n.

His territory surpassed that of his father or grandfather.* He had a son called Gaj Singh,\u2020 whom he entrusted with all his administrative affairs. As I knew him to be capable and worthy of favour, I promoted him to the mansab of 3,000 personal and 2,000 horse, with a standard and the title of Raja, and his younger brother to that of 500 personal and 250 horse, and gave him a jagir in his native country.\n\nOn Thursday, the 10th of Mihr, at the request of \u0100\u1e63af K., I went to his house built on the bank of the Jumna. He has erected a very fine bath-house (\u1e25amm\u0101m), with which I was much delighted. After bathing, a feast of cups was held, and my private servants were made happy with cups of delight. Having chosen out of his offerings what I approved, I gave the remainder to him. What I took of his offering might be of the value of Rs. 30,000. B\u0101qir K., faujdar of Multan, was honoured with a standard.\n\nPreviously to this, according to order, they had planted trees on both sides from Agra as far as the River of Attock (the Indus), and had made an avenue, and in the same way from Agra to Bengal. I now ordered that from Agra to Lahore they should put up a pillar\u2021 (m\u012bl) at every koss, to be the sign of a koss, and at every three koss make a well, so that wayfarers might travel in ease and contentment, and not endure hardships from thirst or the heat of the sun.\n\nOn Thursday, the 24th of Mihr, the festival of the Dasahr\u0101 was held. After the custom of India, they decorated the horses and produced them before me. After I had seen the horses they brought some of the elephants. As Mu\u2018tamid K. on last New Year\u2019s Day had not made any offering, at this festival he presented a golden tablet (takht), a ruby ring, a\n\n* Nab\u012bra here cannot mean grandson, for S\u016braj Singh, commonly called S\u016br Singh, was fifth in descent from Maldeo (Blochmann, 359).

See Tod, who says S\u016br Singh passed nearly all his life as an alien.\n\n\u2020 Tod has much to say about Gaj Singh, but the account seems hardly trustworthy.\n\n\u2021 The text, p. 277, has a representation of one of these milestones which was outside Delhi.\npiece of coral (*bussad*), and other items. The tablet was beautifully made. The total value of the offering was Rs. 16,000. As he had brought the things from pure sincerity and loyalty, they were accepted. On this day Zabar-dast K. was promoted to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 400 horse.\n\nAs the day of the Dasahra had been fixed as the time of starting, I embarked on a boat with all happy omens and pleasure in the evening, and went on to my goal. I halted for eight days at the first stage that the men might come on, after making all preparations at leisure. Mah\u0101bat K. had sent apples from Bangash by runners (*d\u0101k-chok\u012b*). They arrived very fresh, and were of excellent flavour. I was greatly pleased in eating them. They cannot be compared with the *s\u012bb-i-kh\u016bb* (\"the good* apples\"?*) of Kabul which I ate there, or with the Samarkand apples that they bring every year. For sweetness and delicacy of flavour they cannot be compared with either of the latter (*i.e.*, the Bangash apples were far better). I had until now never seen such delicate and delicious apples. They say that in Upper Bangash, near Lashkar-dara,\u2020 there is a village called S\u012bv R\u0101m, in which there are three trees of this apple, and although they have made many trials, they have never found so good ones in any other place. I gave Sayyid \u1e24asan, ambassador of my brother Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s, a dish of these apples in order that he might tell me if there were any better apples in \u2018Ir\u0101q. He said: \"In the whole of Persia the apples of Isfahan are preferred, and they are of the same quality as these.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the 1st of the Divine month of \u0100b\u0101n, I went on pilgrimage to the mausoleum of the late king (Akbar) (may the lights of Allah be his testimony!), and rubbed the head of supplication on the threshold, the abode of angels, and presented 100 muhars as nazar. All the Begams and other ladies, having sought the blessing of circulating round that shrine, which is the circling-place of angels, presented offerings. On the eve of Friday a lofty assembly was held\n\n---\n\n* Perhaps *s\u012bb-i-kh\u016bb* is the name of a kind of apple.\n\n\u2020 I.O. MS. 181 has *Shukr-dar\u0101* and the name of the village as *Shin-war\u0101n*. The printed text has *Siwar\u0101n*.\nof the holy men (*Mash\u0101\u02beikh*), the turbaned people (*arb\u0101b-i-\u02bfam\u0101\u02beim*\u2014i.e., ecclesiastics, etc.), *\u1e24uff\u0101\u1e93* (those who recite the Qoran), and singing people, assembled in numbers, and practised ecstasies and religious dancing (*wajd* and *sam\u0101\u02be*), to each of whom, according to the circumstances of his merit and skill, I gave a dress of honour, a *farj\u012b*, and a shawl. The buildings of this blessed mausoleum have been made very lofty. At this time the money expended satisfied me, and was far more than it had previously been. (The MS.* here is clear, and the printed words wrong.)\n\nOn the 3rd, after four gharis of day had passed, I marched on from that stage, and having traversed $5\\frac{1}{2}$ koss by the river at four gharis of the day, arrived at the next stage. After midday I left the boat and caught seven partridges (*durra\u02bej*). At the end of the day I gave Rs. 20,000 to Sayyid \u1e24asan, the ambassador (of Persia), as a present, and a dress of honour of gold brocade with a jewelled *j\u012bqha* (turban-ornament), and an elephant, and gave him leave to return, and sent for my brother with him a jewelled jug made in the shape of a cock, which could hold my usual stint of wine. It is hoped that it may reach its destination in safety. I gave leave to Lashkar K., who had been appointed to the defence and government of Agra, with a gift of a dress of honour, a horse, an elephant, drums, and a jewelled dagger. Ikram K. was promoted to the mansab of 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse, and to the duty of faujdar of the Sark\u0101r of Mewat. He is s. Isl\u0101m K., who was the grandson of the venerable asylum of pardon Shaikh Salim, whose excellency of person and approved disposition and connection in blessing with this illustrious family have been described in these pages with the pen of sincerity.\n\nAt this time I heard from a certain person whose words are adorned with the light of truth that at the time when I was sick and weak at Ajmir, before this evil news arrived\n\n---\n\n* Mr. Rogers here refers to the R.A.S. MS. The I.O. MSS. are not clear. Apparently what Jah\u0101ng\u012br says is: \u201cOn this occasion fresh items of expenditure occurred to me, and the former outlay was greatly increased.\u201d The word *ta\u1e63arruf\u0101t* (\u201cexpenditure\u201d) is omitted in the printed copy.\nin the province of Bengal, one day Isl\u0101m K. was sitting in private, when he suddenly became unconscious. When he came to himself he said to one of his confidants, of the name of Bh\u012bkan, that it had been shown him from the world of mysteries that the holy person of the Emperor had been attacked by sickness, and that the remedy for it was to sacrifice for him something that was exceedingly dear and precious to himself. It at first occurred to him to sacrifice for the head of the revered one his own son H\u016bshang, but as he was young in years and as yet had derived no profit from life, and not attained to the desire of his heart, he had compassion on him, and would sacrifice himself for his lord and master. He hoped that as this was from the bottom of his heart, and the sincerity of his being, it would be accepted at the throne of Allah. The arrow of prayer at once reached the target of acceptance, and he perceived himself afflicted with weakness and disease. Verily, verily, the disease increased till he reached the neighbourhood of the compassion of God (he died). The Great Physician bestowed from the hidden dispensary complete recovery on this suppliant. Although the late king (the lights of Allah be his testimony !), was much attached to the children and grandchildren of the Shaikhu-l-Isl\u0101m, and bestowed favours on them all according to the capacity and aptitude of each, yet when the turn of rule came to this suppliant, they received great kindnesses in order to perform what was due to that revered one (Sal\u012bm Chisht\u012b), and many of them attained to the high nobility, and were advanced to the posts of head of Subahs, as has been brought to record each in its own place.\n\nAs in this village the eunuch Hil\u0101l K.,* who was one of my attendants from the time when I was prince, had built a sar\u0101y, and made a garden, he made an offering to me. In order to dignify him I took a trifle from him. After marching four stages from this halting-place, the army of prosperity encamped outside Mathura. On Thursday, the 8th, I went to see Bindr\u0101ban and the idol temples of that place.\n\n* The village must be Hilalabad, near Rankatta (Blochmann, 332).\nAlthough* in the time of the late king the Rajput nobles had built temples after their fashion, and ornamented them highly on the outside, inside them bats and owls (ab\u0101b\u012bl) had made their abode to such an extent, that on account of the mal-odours one could not breathe.\n\nVerse.\n\n\"Outside, like an infidel's grave, full of cracks,\u2020\nInside, the anger of God, the honoured and glorious.\"\n\nOn this day Mukhli\u015f K., according to order, came from Bengal, and had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. He gave 100 muhars and 100 rupees as nazar, and by way of offering, a ruby and jewelled aigrette (\u1e6durra). On Friday, the 9th, Rs. 600,000 of treasure for the maintenance (zakh\u012bra) of the fort of Asir were sent to the Commander-in-Chief, Kh\u0101n-kh\u0101n\u0101n.\n\nIn the foregoing pages, something has been written about Gos\u0101'in Jadr\u016bp,\u2021 who lived as a hermit in Ujain. At this time he changed his residence to Mathura, which is one of the greatest places of worship of the Hindus, and employed himself in the worship of the true God on the bank of the Jumna. As I valued his society, I hastened to wait on him, and for a long time enjoyed his company without the presence of any stranger. In truth, his existence is a great gain to me: one can be greatly benefited and delighted.\n\nOn Saturday, the 10th, the huntsmen represented that there was in that neighbourhood a tiger that greatly troubled\n\n* Jah\u0101ng\u012br says nothing about the permission that he gave to B\u012br Singh Deo\u2014as a reward for murdering Ab\u016b-l-Fazl\u2014to build a very splendid temple at Mathura. It was destroyed by Aurangzib. See Growse's \"Mathura.\"\n\n\u2020 Text halal, which means \"weakness,\" or hulal (\"striped garments\"). But according to the MSS., the true reading is khalal, which means \"a crack\" and also \"corruption.\"\n\n\u2021 The Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 128, calls him Achadr\u016bp, and says that the Khan A'zam went privately to him and begged him to use his influence with Jah\u0101ng\u012br for the release of Khusrau. Achadr\u016bp spoke accordingly, and Khusrau was released and allowed to pay his respects. See irfra for account of his release. After Jadr\u016bp removed to Mathura, he was cruelly beaten by H\u0101kim Beg. See Ma'\u0101\u1e63iru-l-Umar\u0101, I. 576.\nand injured the ryots and wayfarers. I immediately ordered them to bring together a number of elephants and surround the forest and at the end of the day myself rode out with my ladies. As I had vowed that I would not injure any living thing with my own hand, I told N\u016br-Jah\u0101n* to shoot at him. An elephant is not at ease when it smells a tiger, and is continually in movement, and to hit with a gun from a litter ('im\u0101r\u012b) is a very difficult matter, insomuch that M\u012brz\u0101 Rustam, who, after me, is unequalled in shooting, has several times missed three or four shots from an elephant. Yet N\u016br-Jah\u0101n B. so hit the tiger with one shot that it was immediately killed.\n\nOn Monday, the 12th, my desire to see the Gosa\u02be\u012bn Jadr\u016bp again increased, and hastening to his hut, without ceremony, I enjoyed his society. Sublime words were spoken between us. God Almighty has granted him an unusual grace, a lofty understanding, an exalted nature, and sharp intellectual powers, with a God-given knowledge and a heart free from the attachments of the world, so that, putting behind his back the world and all that is in it, he sits content in the corner of solitude and without wants. He has chosen of worldly goods half a gaz of old cotton (kirp\u0101s) like a woman\u2019s veil, and a piece of earthenware from which to drink water, and in winter and summer and the rainy season lives naked and with his head and feet bare. He has made a hole in which he can turn round with a hundred difficulties and tortures, with a passage such that a suckling could hardly be put through it. These two or three couplets of \u1e24ak\u012bm Sana\u02be\u012b (may God have mercy on him!) appeared appropriate:\n\nVerse.\u2020\n\n\u201cLuqm\u0101n had a narrow hut,\nLike the hollow of a flute or the bosom of a harp.\nA noodle put the question to him\u2014\n\u2018What is this house\u2014two feet and a span?\u2019\nHotly and with tears the sage replied\u2014\n\u2018Ample for him who has to die.\u2019\u201d\n\n* Elliot, VI. 367.\n\u2020 Luqm\u0101n is the Eastern Aesop, and there is much about him in D\u2019Herbelot. In the second line the word translated \u201chollow\u201d is\nOn Wednesday, the 14th, I again went to visit the Gos\u0101\u02bein and bade him good-bye. Undoubtedly parting from him\n\ngul\u016bg\u0101h, literally \u201cthroat place,\u201d and the word for bosom is s\u012bna, the whole expression being s\u012bna-i-chang. Chang is a harp or lyre, and apparently the expression refers to the narrowness of the space between the horns of a lyre (chang, which appears to be the Jew\u2019s harp), or the sides of a harp. The fourth line is obscure, and the version in text seems corrupt. The words shash bidast d\u016b p\u0101y seem unintelligible. They, however, occur in I.O. MS. 181, f. 161a, and in I.O. MS. 305, f. 225a. The only difference is that they have a conjunction after bidast. On the other hand, the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, which inserts the lines into the record of the eleventh year, has, at p. 95, a different reading for the fourth line. The words there are kh\u0101na yak bidast u sih pay. Bidast is given in Richardson, and the Farhang-i-Rashidi as meaning a span, so the line as given in the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma may mean 3 feet and 1 span. The author of the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma was so struck with the verse of \u1e24ak\u012bm San\u0101\u02bei and the appearance of Jadr\u016bp\u2019s dwelling, that he composed a ma\u1e63nav\u012b on the subject, which he gives at pp. 95, 96. There is a third version in Daulat Sh\u0101h\u2019s anthology, p. 97 of Professor Browne\u2019s edition. There, in the second line we, have halqa (\u201cring\u201d), or perhaps \u201cplectrum\u201d instead of s\u012bna. We have also two lines not given in the T\u016bzuk or the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, and the line containing the noodle\u2019s question is given thus: \u201cK\u012bn chih j\u0101yast yak p\u016bst u d\u016b pay.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat place is this, one skin (?) and two feet.\u201d\n\nAs if the meaning was that Luqm\u0101n lived in a tent propped up by two sticks. In the first line, also, we have wis\u0101qi instead of kurichi.\n\nThe lines may be versified thus:\n\n\u201cLuqm\u0101n\u2019s cell was small and narrow to boot,\nLike the throat of a pipe, or the breast of a lute.\nA foolish one said to the grand old man\u2014\n\u2018What house is this\u2014three feet and six span?\u2019\nWith tears and emotion the sage made reply\u2014\n\u2018Ample for him whose task is to die.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the Nawalkishor edition of \u1e24ak\u012bm San\u0101\u02bei\u2019s poem the lines are entered as in the seventh book of the \u1e24adiqa, but in two B.M. MSS. (Add. 25,329, f. 145a, and Or. 358, f. 172b), they are placed in the fifth book. Both of these MSS. have bidast, apparently, and Add. 25,329, has shash (\u201csix\u201d), but Or. 358 has shass. There is such a word, meaning hard ground. Both MSS. have sih (\u201cthree\u201d). Bidast may properly be bad-pusht (\u201cbad-backed\u201d), or it may be bad-past (\u201cbad and mean\u201d). The reference in verse may be rather to the curvature of the chang (Arabic, sanj) than to its narrowness, for Jam\u012b speaks of the back \u201cbeing bent like a harp.\u201d\nweighed upon my mind, that desires the truth. On Thursday the 15th, I marched and pitched near Brind\u0101ban. At this stage my fortunate son Sult\u0101n Parw\u012bz took leave of me for Allahabad, and went to his jagir. I had intended that he should accompany me on this expedition, but as he had already shown symptoms of distress, I could not avoid letting him go. I presented him with a tipch\u0101q horse, a waist dagger with a veined (jauhar-d\u0101r) walrus-tooth (hilt), and a sword and special shield. I hope he will come again soon, and have the good fortune of my presence. As the period of Khusrau\u2019s imprisonment had been a long one, it seemed to me that to keep him longer in confinement and deprive him of the good fortune of waiting on me, would be wanting in kindness. I accordingly sent* for him and bade him salute me. Once again the marks of his offences were washed with the pure water of forgiveness, and the dust of disgrace and humiliation was rubbed off his brow. I hope that the blessing of pleasing me, and the grace of service may be his lot.\n\nOn Friday, the 16th, I gave leave to Mukhl\u012b\u1e63 K., whom I had sent for to take up the duties of diwan to Sh\u0101h Parw\u012bz, and I gave him the rank he had\u2020 had in Bengal\u2014viz., 2,000 with 700 horse. On Saturday I halted. At this stage Sayyid Niz\u0101m s. M\u012br M\u012br\u0101n \u1e62adr Jah\u0101n, who was faujdar of Kanauj, waited upon me, and presented two elephants, and some hawks. I accepted one elephant and a pair of hawks. On Sunday, the 18th, we marched. At this time the King of Persia had sent with Pari Beg M\u012br Shik\u0101r (chief hunstman) one falcon (shunq\u0101r) of good colour. There was another which had been given to the Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam. This one was sent along with the Sh\u0101h\u012b falcon (i.e., the one intended for Jah\u0101ng\u012br), and it died on the road. The Sh\u0101h\u012b falcon, too, got mauled by a cat owing to the carelessness of the M\u012br Shik\u0101r. Though it was brought to Court, it did not live more than a week.\n\n* Compare Price, 123.\n\u2020 Ba dust\u016br\u012b kih dar Bang\u0101la d\u0101sht.\n\nI think this must mean that his men were allowed the Bengal batta, or exceptional allowance, which used to be 50 p.c. of pay elsewhere. See A.N., III. 293, the eighth reason for the rebellion.\nWhat can I write* of the beauty and colour of this falcon? There were many beautiful black markings on each wing, and back, and sides. As it was something out of the common, I ordered Ust\u0101d Man\u1e63\u016br, who has the title of N\u0101diru-l-\u2018a\u1e63r (wonder of the age) to paint and preserve\u2020 its likeness. I gave the M\u012br Shik\u0101r Rs. 2,000 and dismissed him.\n\nIn my father\u2019s reign (the light of God be his testimony!) the weight of the seer was 30 dams.\u00a7 About this time it came into my mind: \u201cWhy should I act contrary to his rules?\u201d It would be better to have it still of 30 dams. One day Gos\u0101\u02bein Jadr\u016bp said that in the book of the Vedas, which the lords of his faith had written, the weight of the s\u012br was 36 dams. \u201cAs from the coincidences of the hidden world your order has fallen in with what is laid down in our book, if it be fixed at 36 dams, it will be well.\u201d It was ordered that hereafter throughout the whole territory it should be 36 dams.\n\nOn Monday, the 19th, I marched. A horse and dress of honour were given to R\u0101ja Bh\u0101o Singh, who had been ordered to the support of the army of the Deccan. From this day, till Wednesday, the 28th, I made successive marches. On Thursday, the 29th, Delhi, the abode of blessings, was adorned\n\n* This passage has been translated by Colonel Phillott in the A.S.B.J. for February, 1907, p. 113. There is something wrong in the text. Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam certainly did not die on the road (see Blochmann, 513), for he waited upon Jah\u0101ng\u012br at Kal\u0101n \u016br (T\u016bzuk, 284); nor did the M\u012br Shik\u0101r, for Jah\u0101ng\u012br says he gave him a present and dismissed him. I presume, therefore, that the word \u201caforesaid\u201d refers to Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam\u2019s hawk.\n\n\u2020 Niq\u0101h-d\u0101rad. Perhaps this means that the painter was afterwards to stuff the bird.\n\n\u2021 This is an obscure passage, and Jadr\u016bp\u2019s reference to the mention of d\u0101ms in the Vedas is curious, for d\u0101m is said to be derived from the Greek drachma. However, it appears from the \u0100yin (Blochmann, 31), that the dam, though in value only the fortieth part of a rupee, weighed 5 t\u0101ns or 1 tola, 8 m\u0101shas, 7 surkhs. The rupee, we are told there, weighed 11\u00bd mashes\u2014i.e., half a masha less than a tola. Consequently the dam weighed over 20 mashes, and so was not far from being equal in weight to 2 rupees. The weight of a seer varied, and it may be 30 or 36 copper dams were reckoned as equal to a seer. By dam Jahangir probably meant pais\u0101, or double pais\u0101. According to Gladwin, 3\u00bd tanks are by jeweller\u2019s weights = one tola, and a tank is 70\u00b7112 grs. Troy.\nby the alighting of the army of good fortune. At first I hastened with my children and the ladies on a visit to the enlightened shrine of Hum\u0101y\u016bn (may the lights of God be his testimony!), and having made our offerings there, went off to circumambulate the blessed mausoleum of the king of holy men (Shaikh Ni\u1e93\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn Chisht\u012b), and strengthened my courage, and at the end of the day alighted at the palace, which had been got ready in Salimgarh. On Friday, the 30th, I halted. As they had at this time preserved the hunting-place of the pargana of P\u0101lam, according to order, it was represented that a great number of antelope had collected there. Accordingly, on the 1st of the Divine month of \u0100zar I started to hunt* with cheetahs. At the end of the day, during the hunt, much hail fell of the size of apples, and made the air very cold. On this day three antelope were caught. On Sunday, the 2nd, I hunted 46 antelope, and on Monday, the 3rd, 24 antelope were caught with cheetahs. My son Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n killed two antelope with his gun. On Tuesday, the 4th, five antelope were caught. On Wednesday, the 5th, 27 antelope were caught. On Thursday, the 6th, Sayyid Bahwa Bukh\u0101r\u012b, who was in charge of the government of Delhi, made an offering of three elephants and eighteen horses, and other things. One elephant and other things were accepted, and I gave the rest to him. H\u0101shim of Khost, faujdar of some parganas in Mew\u0101t, had the honour of kissing the threshold. I employed myself within the limits of P\u0101lam until Thursday, the 13th, in hunting with cheetahs. In the space of twelve days 426 antelopes were caught, and I returned to Delhi. I had heard, when in attendance on my father, that it is impossible for an antelope that has escaped from the grasp of a cheetah to live, although it has not been injured by its claws. In this hunt I, in order to ascertain the fact, released several antelopes of handsome appearance and strong bodies, before they had received any wounds from teeth or claws, and ordered them to be kept in my presence, and that they should be taken the\n\n* As stated below, the antelope which were caught all eventually died.\ngreatest care of. For a whole day and night they remained at ease in their natural conditions; on the second day a change was observed, and they threw about their legs as if they were drunk, without any reason, and fell down and rose up. However much *tiryaq-i-far\u016bqi* (preparation of opium) and other suitable medicines were administered to them, they had no effect, and when one watch had passed in this condition, they died.\n\nOn this day the bad news arrived that the eldest son of Sh\u0101h Parwiz had died at Agra. As he was somewhat grown-up,* and was very attached and affectionate towards his father, the latter was exceedingly grieved and wounded at heart at this event, and great bewilderment and weakness manifested themselves in him. In order to console and please him, I sent him gracious letters, and covered over the deadly wound of his heart with the balm of affection and kindness. I hope that God, the great and glorious, may grant him patience and resignation, for in this kind of calamities there can be no better driver away of grief than endurance and resignation.\n\nOn Friday, the 14th, at the request of \u0100q\u0101\u2020 \u0100q\u0101y\u0101n, I went to her house. On account of her previous service and her hereditary attachment to this illustrious family, when the late king made me a married man, he took her from my sister Sh\u0101h-z\u0101da Kh\u0101nam, and placed her in charge of my Zanana. It is 33 years from that date that she has been in my service, and I esteem her greatly, for she has served me with sincerity. In no journey or expedition had she of her own will remained absent from attendance on me. When she felt her increasing age, she requested me to order her to remain at Delhi, and to spend the remainder of her life in prayer for me, for she had no longer the power to move about, and found it a great hardship and trouble to come\n\n---\n\n* Text *gul-rang*, which seems unintelligible. No. 181 M.S. has *kal\u0101nak* (\"somewhat grown-up\"). The child was presumably the Sultan D\u016br-and\u012bsh, born at the end of the ninth year (T\u016bzuk, 137), and so was now about five years old. Gul-rang occurs in B.M. MS., and may mean \"ruddy.\"\n\n\u2020 Text has \u0100gh\u0101-i-Agh\u0101m\u0101n. The MSS. have \u0100q\u0101 \u0100q\u0101y\u0101n (\"Agha of Aghas\").\nand go (as she used). One of her felicities was that she was of the same age* as \u2018Arsh-\u0101shy\u0101n\u012b (Akbar). In brief, with a view to giving her rest, I ordered her to remain at Delhi, and in that place she had made for herself a garden, a saray, and a tomb, in the constructing which she has employed herself for some time past. In short, to please this ancient servitor, I went to her house, and strictly ordered Sayyid Bahwa, the governor of the city, to serve and guard her in such a manner that no dust from any road of vexation might settle on the hem of her contentment.\n\nOn this day R\u0101ja Kishan D\u0101s was promoted to the mansab of 2,000 personal and 300 horse, original and increased. As Sayyid Bahwa\u2020 had performed satisfactorily the duties of faujdar of Delhi, and the people of the place were much pleased with his excellent conduct, according to previous custom, the protection and administration of the city of Delhi and the faujdarship of the surrounding country were entrusted to him, and he was promoted to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 600 horse, original and increased, and he was presented with an elephant, and allowed to take leave. On Saturday, the 15th, I honoured M\u012brz\u0101 W\u0101li with the mansab of 2,000 and 1,000 horse, and presenting him with a standard and an elephant, appointed him to the Deccan. Shaikh \u2018Abdu-l-\u1e24aqq Dihlaw\u012b,\u2021 who was a pious and estimable man, had the good fortune to pay his respects to me. He had composed a book containing the biographies of the Shaikhs of India, and produced it to me. He had endured some hardships, and for a long time had lived in Delhi in seclusion, and the practice of reliance on God, and of asceticism. He is a very worthy man, and his company is not without pleasure (for me). Bestowing various kinds of kindnesses on him, I dismissed him.\n\nOn Sunday, the 16th, I marched from Delhi, and on Friday,\n\n* Akbar was born in October, 1542, so she was now seventy-seven years old.\n\u2020 Sayyid Bahwa is commonly known as D\u012bn-d\u0101r K.

Muqarrab had made buildings and gardens there. As I had often heard praise of his garden, I wished much to see it. On Saturday, the 22nd, I and my ladies were much pleased in going round it. Truly, it is a very fine and enjoyable garden. Within a masonry (pukhta, pucca) wall, flower-beds have been laid out to the extent of 140 bighas. In the middle of the garden he has constructed a pond, in length 220 yards, and in breadth 200 yards. In the middle of the pond is a m\u0101h-t\u0101b terrace (for use in moonlight) 22 yards square. There is no kind of tree belonging to a warm or cold climate that is not to be found in it. Of fruit-bearing trees belonging to Persia I saw green pistachio-trees, and cypresses of graceful form, such as I have never seen before. I ordered the cypresses to be counted, and they came to 300. All round the pond suitable buildings have been begun and are in progress.\n\nOn Monday, the 24th, Khanjar K., in whose charge is the Fort of Ahmadnagar, was promoted to the mansab of 2,500 personal and 1,600 horse. On Wednesday, the 26th, the Giver of Bounties gave my son Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n a son by the daughter of \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n. He presented an offering of 1,000 muhars, and begged for a name for him. I gave him the name of Um\u012bd-bakhsh (bestower of hope). I hope his advent\u2020 may be auspicious to this State. On Thursday, the 27th, I halted. In these few days I was delighted with hawking the jarz\u2021 (bustard or florican) and t\u016bgh-d\u0101r\u012b (also a kind of bustard). I ordered the jarz-i-b\u016br (the red bustard?) to be weighed. It came to $2\\frac{1}{4}$ Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b sirs, and the variegated (ablaq) one to $2\\frac{1}{8}$ sirs. The large t\u016bgh-d\u0101r\u012b was $\\frac{1}{4}$ sir heavier than the jarz-i-b\u016br. On Thursday, the 5th of the Divine month of Day, I left the boat at Akbarpur, and\n\n* In Sark\u0101r Sah\u0101ranpur. Elliot, Supp. Gloss., II. 129.

From Agra to this halting-place, which is situated within two koss of the pargana of Buriya,* is by river 123 koss or 91 koss by road. I did it in 34 marches and 17 halts. In addition to this I delayed a week in leaving the city, and 12 days in sporting in P\u0101lam: altogether (I took) 70 days. On this day Jah\u0101ng\u012br Qul\u012b K. came from Bih\u0101r, and had the good fortune to pay his respects. He presented 100 muhars and Rs. 100. From the last Thursday to Wednesday, the 11th, I marched every day. On Thursday, the 12th, I was pleased with going round to see the garden of Sirhind. It is one of the old gardens, and has old trees in it. It has not the freshness it formerly had, but it is still valuable. Khw\u0101ja Wais\u012b, who is well acquainted with agriculture and buildings, was appointed the karori of Sirhind for the purpose of keeping the garden in order. I had sent him off from Agra before I marched from the capital, and he had put it somewhat in order. I strictly enjoined him again that he should remove all the old trees that had no freshness in them, and put in fresh plants, to clean up the \u2018irqband\u012b\u2020 (it is \u2018ir\u0101q-band\u012b in the text. The word does not occur in the B.M. MS. but is in the I.O. MS.), and repair the old buildings, and erect other buildings in the shape of baths, etc., in fitting places. On this date D\u016bst Beg, who was one of the auxiliaries of \u2018Abdull\u0101h K., was promoted to the mansab of 700 personal and 50 horse, Mu\u1e93affar \u1e24usain, s. Waz\u012br K., to that of 600 personal and 300 horse. Shaikh Q\u0101sim was sent to duty in the Deccan. On Thursday, the 19th, at the request of my auspicious son Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n, I went to his house. On account of the birth of the son that God Almighty had bestowed on him a grand entertainment was given, and he presented offerings. Among these was a short, broad sword\u2021 (shamsh\u012br-i-nimcha), which\n\n* Perhaps this is Bir\u016b\u2019\u012b in Sambhal, Jarrett, II. 200.

The weapon is described in text as shamsh\u012br-i-nimcha-i-yak-\u0101wiz.\nwas of Venetian workmanship. The hilt and fastenings were made of a sapphire* cut in Europe: in short, it had been beautifully made. Another offering was an elephant which the Raja of Bagl\u0101na had presented to my son in Burh\u0101npur. As that elephant was handsome and well-behaved, it was ordered to be included among the private elephants. The value of the offerings that were accepted was Rs. 130,000, and he offered about Rs. 4,000 to his mothers and benefactors.\n\nOn this day Sayyid B\u0101yaz\u012bd Bukh\u0101r\u012b, faujdar of Bhakkar, sent as an offering a rang (ibex), which he had brought from the hills when it was small and brought up in his house. It pleased me greatly. Of m\u0101r-kh\u016br and hill sheep I have seen many brought up in the house, but I never saw a rang (tame). I ordered them to keep it with the Barbary goats, in order that they might pair and produce young ones. Without doubt, it is not allied to the m\u0101r-kh\u016br or the quchq\u0101r. Sayyid B\u0101yaz\u012bd was raised to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 700 horse. On Monday, the 23rd, having honoured Muq\u012bm K. with a robe of honour, a horse, an elephant, and jewelled khapwa, I appointed him to Bih\u0101r. On Sunday, the 29th, a feast was prepared for my auspicious son Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n on the bank of the Biya (Beas), and on the same day R\u0101ja Bikram\u0101jit, who was employed in the siege of K\u0101ngra, came to Court, by order, to represent certain requirements, and had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. On Monday, the 30th, my son Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n took ten days\u2019 leave, and hastened to Lahore in order to see the palace buildings lately erected. R\u0101ja Bikram\u0101jit was presented with a special dagger, a robe of honour, and a horse, and returned to duty on the siege of K\u0101ngra. On Wednesday, the 2nd of the Divine month of Bahman, the garden of Kal\u0101naur was honoured by my halting there. At this place my father had ascended the throne.\n\nWhen the news of the speedy arrival of Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam reached\n\n* Az n\u012blam-i-farang-tar\u0101sh. It is difficult to suppose that the hilt was a sapphire. Possibly \u201cn\u012blam\u201d is the European artist\u2019s name, or n\u012blam-i-farang may be some kind of European work or material. Query niello?\nthe Court, every day I sent one of my servants to meet him. I loaded him with all kinds of favours and kindnesses, and added to his rank and dignity, and I decked the headings of the farmans sent to him with an impromptu hemistich or couplet suitable to the occasion, and so filled him with favours. Once I sent him some Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b (otto of roses), and this opening verse came on my tongue:\n\nVerse.*\n\n\"To thee I've sent the scent of myself,\nThat I may bring thee the more quickly to myself.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the 3rd (Bahman), at the garden of Kal\u0101naur, Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam was honoured by kissing the threshold. By way of nazar he brought 100 muhars and Rs. 1,000, and (stated that he) would present his offerings in due course. Zambil Beg, the ambassador of my brother Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s, was following him with the royal letter and the rarities of that country (Persia), which he had sent as presents. Of the favours and kindness conferred by my brother on Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam, if I were to write of them in detail, I should be accused of exaggeration. In conversation he always gave him the title of Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam, and never had him out of his presence. If he ever voluntarily stayed in his own quarter, he (\u2018Abb\u0101s) would go there without ceremony, and show him more and more favour.\n\nOne day there was a qamurqha hunt at Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d, and he ordered Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam to shoot with a bow. Out of good manners he brought a bow with two arrows (only). The Shah gave him 50 other arrows from his own quiver. It happened that 50 of these arrows struck the game, and two arrows missed. Then he ordered some of his attendants who had the entr\u00e9e at feasts and assemblies to shoot with arrows. Most shot well. Among them Mu\u1e25ammad Y\u016bsuf (qar\u0101wul), shot an arrow which went through two boars, and those who were standing by broke out without control into applause. At the time Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam took his leave, he seized him in the\n\n* B\u016by-i-khw\u012bsh (\"my own scent\"). The scent (otto of roses) was invented by Jah\u0101ng\u012br's mother-in-law (the mother of N\u016br-Jah\u0101n). She called it after Jah\u0101ng\u012br's name.\nembrace of honour, and showed him great affection. After he had left the city, he went to his halting-place, and made many apologies and bade him farewell. As for the beautiful and costly things that the Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam brought, it was indeed the assistance of his destiny that gave such rare things into his hand. Among them was the picture of the fight of \u0160\u0101hib Qir\u0101n (Tim\u016br) with Tuqtamish K., and the likenesses of him and his glorious children and the great Amirs who had the good fortune to be with him in that fight, and near each figure was written whose portrait it was. In this picture there were 240 figures. The painter had written his name as Khal\u012bl M\u012brz\u0101 Sh\u0101hrukh\u012b (in the MS. it is Savaj and not Sh\u0101hrukh\u012b). The work was very complete and grand, and resembled greatly the paint-brush of Ust\u0101d Bihz\u0101d. If the name of the painter had not been written, the work would have been believed to be his. As it was executed before Bihz\u0101d\u2019s date it is probable that the latter was one of Khal\u012bl M\u012brz\u0101\u2019s pupils, and had adopted his style. This precious relic had been obtained from the illustrious library of Sh\u0101h Ism\u0101\u2018il (the 1st), or had come to my brother Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s from Sh\u0101h Tahm\u0101sp. A person of the name of \u0160\u0101diq\u012b, a librarian of his, had stolen it, and sold it to someone. By chance (the painting) fell into the hands of Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam at Isfahan. The Shah heard that he had found such a rare prize, and asked it of him on the pretence of looking at it. Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam tried to evade this by artful stratagems, but when he repeatedly insisted on it, he sent it to him. The Shah recognized it immediately he saw it. He kept it by him for a day, but at last, as he knew how great was our liking for such rarities, he\u2014God be praised\u2014made no request* whatever for it, but told the facts of the case (about its being stolen) to Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam, and made the picture over to him.\n\nAt the time when I sent Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam to Persia, I had sent with him a painter of the name of Bishan D\u0101s, who was unequalled in his age for taking likenesses, to take the portraits of the Shah and the chief men of his State, and bring them.\n\n* The meaning of the clause is obscure.\nHe had drawn the likenesses of most of them, and especially had taken that of my brother the Shah exceedingly well, so that when I showed it to any of his servants, they said it was exceedingly well drawn.\n\nOn the same day Q\u0101sim K., with the Bakhshi and Diwan of Lahore, had the good fortune to do homage. B\u012bshan D\u0101s, the painter, was honoured with the gift of an elephant. B\u0101b\u0101 Khw\u0101ja, who was one of the auxiliaries of Qandahar, was accorded the mansab of 1,000 personal and 550 horse. On Tuesday, the 3rd, Mad\u0101ru-l-mah\u0101mm\u012b (centre of important affairs) I\u2019tim\u0101du-d-daula made ready his army. Inasmuch as the charge of the Panjab is entrusted to his agents, and he has also various jagirs in Hindustan, he held a review of 5,000 horsemen. As the area of Kashmir is not such that its produce may suffice for the expenses of the force that is always on service with the servants of the army of prosperity, and as, in consequence of the report (of the approach) of the glorious and victorious standards, the price of grains and vegetables had risen very high, an order was given, for the comfort of the public, that those servants who were in attendance on the royal stirrup should arrange their retinues, and only taking with them those who were indispensable, should send the remainder to their jagirs, and in the same way should take every precaution to reduce as far as possible the number of their beasts and followers. On Thursday, the 10th, my fortunate son, Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n returned from Lahore, and had the good fortune to do homage. Having honoured Jah\u0101ng\u012br Qul\u012b K. with a dress of honour, a horse and an elephant, I gave him leave to proceed with his brothers and sons to the Deccan. On this day T\u0101lib \u0100mul\u012b received the title of Maliku-sh-shu\u2018ar\u0101 (king of poets), and was clothed in a dress of honour. His origin was from \u0100mul. For some time he was with I\u2019tim\u0101du-d-daula. As the merits of his style surpassed that of his contemporaries, he was enrolled among the poets of the throne. The following couplets are by him:\nVerse.*\n\n\"Spring longs to rifle thy parterre,\nFor the flowers in thy hand are fresher than those on his branch.\nI've so closed my lips from speech that you'd say\n'His mouth is but a scar on his face.'\"\n\nVerse.\n\n\"Both first and last, Love is aye music and joy\u2014\nA pleasant wine both when fresh and when mellow.\"\n\nVerse.\n\n\"Were I glass instead of body,\nI'd reveal thee to thyself without thy unveiling.\nTwo lips have I; one for drinking,\nAnd one to apologize for drunkenness.\"\n\nOn Monday, the 14th, \u1e24usain\u012b s. Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Qiw\u0101m produced this quatrain:\n\nQuatrain.\n\n\"A speck of dust sprinkled on thee from thy skirt\nBecomes Solomon's collyrium; from the moisture of thy face\u2020\nWere the earth at thy door examined,\nThe sweat of kings' brows would exude.\"\n\nAt this time Mu'tamid K. repeated a quatrain which greatly pleased me, and which I entered in my common-place book:\n\nQuatrain.\u00a7\n\n\"You give me the poison of parting to taste, (and say) 'What matters it?'\nYou shed my blood and expel me (and say), 'What matters it?'\nO, heedless of what your dividing sword can do,\nSift my dust and then you'll know.\"\n\n* The first line is obscure and the MSS. do not help. Possibly the meaning is Spring thanks thee for robbing his garden, or it may be, Spring is exhorted to rob thy garden. The quatrain is also given in the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 132.\n\n\u2020 Meaning that the lips were so closed that the mouth looked like a thin scar.\n\n\u2021 The collyrium of Solomon was something which enabled one to see hidden treasures.\n\n\u00a7 This quatrain is stated in the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 133, to be by B\u0101b\u0101 T\u0101lib Isfah\u0101n\u012b. He is a quite different person from T\u0101lib \u0100mul\u012b. The same quatrain is given by Ab\u016b-l-Fa\u017cl, and I am indebted to Mr. Blochmann, p. 607, for being able to understand it. B\u0101b\u0101\nT\u0101lib (i.e., B\u0101b\u0101 T\u0101lib) is by family an I\u1e63fah\u0101n\u012b. In his early youth he went to Kashmir clothed as an ascetic and calendar, and from the beauty of the place and the pleasantness of the climate set his heart on the country and settled there. After the conquest of Kashmir he joined the service of the late king (Akbar), and became enrolled among the servants of the Presence. His age is now nearly 100 years, and he is now with his sons and dependants in Kashmir, engaged in praying for the everlasting State.\n\nAs it was reported to me that in Lahore one Miy\u0101n Shaikh Muhammad Mir by name, who was a Darvish, a Sind\u012b by origin, very eloquent, virtuous, austere, of auspicious temperament, a lord of ecstasy, had seated himself in the corner of reliance upon God and retirement, and was rich in his poverty and independent of the world, my truth-seeking mind was not at rest without meeting him, and my desire to see him increased. As it was impossible to go to Lahore, I wrote a note to him, and explained to him the desire of my heart, and that saint, notwithstanding his great age and weakness, took the trouble to come. I sate with him for a long time alone, and enjoyed a thorough interview with him. Truly he is a noble personage, and in this Age he is a great gain and a delightful existence. This suppliant for Grace was taken out of himself by companionship with him,* and heard from him sublime words of truth and religious knowledge. Although I desired to make him some gift, I found that his spirit was too high for this, and so did not express my wish. I left him the skin of a white antelope to pray upon, and he immediately bade me farewell and went back to Lahore.\n\nOn Wednesday, the 23rd, I pitched my camp at Daulat\u0101b\u0101d. A daughter of a gardener was brought before me\n\n*T\u0101lib I\u1e63fah\u0101n\u012b is not mentioned by Dr. Rieu. At Vol. II., 679b, of his Catalogue, there is an account of T\u0101lib \u0100mul\u012b, who, it is said, died young. B\u0101b\u0101 T\u0101lib died somewhat later, and at the age of over 100. See Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, loc. cit., and Baday\u016bn\u012b, III. 265.\n\n* A Mu\u1e25ammad Shaikh is mentioned in Beale as the author of two books (see p. 273, col. 2). One of them was the J\u0101m-i-Jah\u0101num\u0101, and is perhaps the work mentioned in Rieu, II. 866a, V.\nwho had a moustache and a thick beard as big as the hilt of a sword. Her appearance was like that of a man. There was hair in the middle of her chest as well, but she had no breasts.* I discovered by her appearance that she ought not to have children. I told some women to take her aside and examine her, as perhaps she might be a hermaphrodite. They found she was in no way different from other women. I have recorded this in this volume on account of its strangeness.\n\nOn Thursday, the 24th, B\u0101qir K., having come from Multan, had the good fortune to pay his respects. In the preceding pages it has been recorded that All\u0101h-d\u0101d, s. Jal\u0101l\u0101 T\u0101r\u012bk\u012b, had deserted from the victorious army and taken the road to ruin. He now repented, and through B\u0101qir K. petitioned I\u2018tim\u0101du-d-daula for pardon. At the latter\u2019s request I ordered that if he repented of what he had done, and turned his face in hope towards the Court, his crimes would be forgiven. On this day B\u0101qir K. brought him to Court, and at the intercession of I\u2018tim\u0101du-d-daula, the traces of disgrace and the dust of sorrow were washed off his forehead with the pure water of pardon. Sangr\u0101m, Zamindar of Jammu, was honoured with the title of Raja and the mansab of 1,000 personal and 500 horse, and was exalted with the gift of an elephant and a dress of honour. Ghairat K., faujdar of the D\u016b-\u0101b, was promoted to the mansab of 800 personal and 500 horse. Khw\u0101ja Q\u0101sim received the rank of 700 and 250 horse, and Taham-tan Beg, s. Q\u0101sim Koka, received that of 500 personal and 300 horse. I gave Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam a private elephant with trappings. From this stage, having given B\u0101qir K. the mansab of 1,500 personal and 500 horse, I dismissed him again to his Subadarship.\n\nOn Monday, the 28th, I pitched in the pargana of Karohi, which is on the bank of the Bihat (Jhelam). As this hilly country is one of the established hunting-places, the huntsmen, according to order, had come on in advance and prepared a jarga (ring in which game is enclosed). On Wednesday, the 1st of the Divine month of Isfand\u0101rmuz, they drove\n\n* Some unnecessary details have been omitted here.\nin the game from six koss. On Thursday, the 2nd, they brought them into the enclosure, where 101 head of mountain sheep and gazelles were taken. As Mah\u0101bat K. had been prevented from the good fortune of coming before me for a long time, I ordered, at his request, that if he was satisfied with the order of affairs, and was not troubled with regard to any occurrence, he should leave his forces at their posts (th\u0101nas), and come to Court unattended. On this day he had the good fortune to kiss the threshold, and presented 100 muhars as nazar. Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam was promoted to the mansab of 5,000 personal and 3,000 horse. About this time a written report came from N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn Quli that he had repaired the P\u016bnch road, and levelled the defiles as far as possible, but that snow fell for some days and nights, and lay on the k\u014dt\u0101ls to the depth of three cubits. It was still falling, and if I would delay outside the hills for a month, I could cross by that route, otherwise it appeared difficult. As my intention in this undertaking was to see the spring and the sprouting of bloom, my chance of seeing this was lost by this delay, and I necessarily turned my rein, and the royal standards proceeded by the way of Pakl\u012b and Damt\u016br.\n\nOn Friday, the 3rd, I crossed the River Bihat (Jhelam), although the water was waist-deep. As it was running very fast, and men crossed with great trouble, I ordered them to take 200 elephants to the fords, and cross the effects of the people over, and take across as well those who were weak and feeble, so that there might be no loss of life or goods.\n\nOn this day news arrived of the death of Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n. He was one of the old servants, and from the time when I was prince. Although at last he left my service, and was for some time in that of my father, yet as he had not gone to any strange place, this did not weigh heavily on my mind. Accordingly, after my accession, I did him such kindness as he had never conceived possible, and gave him the mansab of 5,000 personal and 3,000 horse. I take this opportunity to record in this volume an account of his idiosyncrasy. He became practised in great affairs and acquired a wonderful skill in business. His capabilities were the result of labour,\nand he was void of natural ability, and of the other qualities which are the adornment of men's nature. On this journey he suffered from heart-failure, but for some days, in spite of illness and breakdown, he kept up with the march. When his weakness increased, he was allowed to go back at Kal\u0101naur, and went to Lahore, and there died a natural death.*\n\nOn Saturday, the 4th of the aforesaid month, the camp was pitched at the Fort of Roht\u0101s (in the Panjab). I favoured Q\u0101sim K. with a horse, a sword, and a special shawl (parm-narm, literally very soft, and Akbar's name for a shawl, see Blochmann, 90). I gave him leave to go to Lahore. There was a small garden by the roadside, and I inspected the blossoms.\n\nAt this stage t\u012bh\u016b\u2020 were obtained. The flesh of the t\u012bh\u016b is better than that of the partridge (kabak).\n\nOn Sunday, the 5th, M. \u1e24asan s. Mirz\u0101 Rustam, was promoted to the rank of 1,000 with 400 horse, and was appointed to the Deccan. Khw\u0101ja \u2018Abdu-l-Lat\u012bf, the chief fowler, also received the rank of 1,000 with 400 horse. At this place I saw a flower, white inside, and red outside, while some of them were red inside and yellow outside. In Persian they call it La\u2018la-i-big\u0101na, and in Hind\u012b thal kanal. Thal means land, and as the lotus (kanal) is an aquatic plant, they have called this land-lotus.\u2021\n\nOn Thursday, the 9th, a report came from Dil\u0101war K., Governor of Kashmir, containing the good news of the conquest of Kishtw\u0101r. Details will be recorded by the pen of the newswriter after he (Dil\u0101war) comes to the foot of the throne. I sent him a gracious farman with a special dress of honour and a jewelled dagger, and granted him the revenue\n\n* Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n's real name was D\u016bst Mu\u1e25., and he was from Kabul. See Blochmann, 424. Jah\u0101ng\u012br's characterization of him is rather obscure, and I am not sure if my translation is correct. Jah\u0101ng\u012br had married his daughter. Blochmann, 477, n. 2.\n\n\u2020 This is the seesee partridge or Ammoperdrix Bonhami of Jerdon, p. 567 of first edition. Jerdon states that in Afghanistan it is called the teehoo, and that its flesh is said to be delicious.\n\n\u2021 Apparently this is the Hibiscus mutabilis, for which the Bengali name is thal padma (\"land lotus\").\nof the conquered province for a year, as a reward for this acceptable service. On Tuesday, the 14th, I halted at \u1e24asan Abd\u0101l. As the occurrences on this road and particulars of the stages have been related in detail in the account of the expedition to Kabul, I shall not repeat them. From this place as far as Kashmir, they will be written stage by stage, please Almighty God. From the date on which, disembarking from a boat, I reached Akbarpur in safety and prosperity, up to \u1e24asan Abd\u0101l, a distance of 178 koss, I took 69 days in 48 marches and 21 halts.* As at this place there is a spring full of water, and a cascade, and a very beautiful reservoir, I halted here two days, and on Thursday, the 16th (Isfand\u0101rmuz), the feast of my lunar weighing took place. The 53rd year, according to lunar calculation, of this suppliant at the throne commenced auspiciously. As beyond this stage, hills, passes, and many ups and downs were before us, the passage of the camp appeared a difficult matter, and it was settled that H. M. Maryamu-z-zam\u0101n\u012b and the other Begams should delay for some days, and come on at leisure. Mad\u0101ru-l-mulk I\u2019tim\u0101du-d-daula al-Kh\u0101q\u0101n\u012b, \u0160\u0101diq K. Bakhsh\u012b, and Ir\u0101dat K. M\u012br-S\u0101m\u0101n, with the directors of the buildings and other offices, should attend to their transit. At the same time Rustam M\u012brz\u0101 \u0160afaw\u012b, Kh\u0101n-A\u02bf\u1e93am, and a number of other servants, obtained leave to go by the P\u016bnch road, while the royal retinue went on with some privileged courtiers (manz\u016br\u0101n-i-bis\u0101\u1e6d-i-qarb) and the necessary servants. On Friday, the 17th, we marched 3\u00bd koss, and halted at the village of Sultanpur.\u2020 On this day came the news of the death of R\u0101n\u0101 Amar Singh, who had died a natural death at Udaipur (become a traveller on the road of non-existence). Jagat Singh, his grandson, and Bh\u012bm,\u2021 his son, who were in attendance on me, were presented with dresses of honour, and an order was given that R\u0101ja Ki\u015bhan D\u0101s should proceed with a gracious farman conferring the\n\n* The word for twenty is omitted in text, and also in Elliot, VI. 367.\n\u2020 \u201cOn the southern bank of the Harroh River,\u201d Elliot, VI. 367.\n\u2021 Bh\u012bm was the younger brother of Karan (Tod). The passage is translated in Elliot, VI. 367.\ntitle of R\u0101n\u0101, a dress of honour, a horse, and a private elephant for Kun\u0101r Karan, to perform the dues of condolence and congratulation. I heard* from people of this country that when it is not the rainy season, and there is no sign of a cloud or lightning, a noise like the voice of the clouds comes from this hill, which they called Garj (thunder). This noise is heard every year or at least every two years. I had repeatedly heard of this also when I was in attendance on the late king. I have written this as it is not devoid of strangeness,\u2020 but wisdom is from Allah. On Saturday, the 18th, marching 4\u00bd koss, I halted at the village of Sanji. From this stage I entered the pargana of Haz\u0101ra Q\u0101rlugh.\u2021\n\nOn Sunday, the 19th, marching 3\u00be koss, I halted at the village of Naushahra.\u00a7 From this place we entered Dhant\u016br. As far as the eye could reach there were green meadows|| interspersed with the thal-kanwal (hibiscus) and other flowers in bloom. It was a very beautiful sight. On Monday, the 20th, marching 3\u00bd koss, the camp was pitched at the village of Salhar.\u00b6 Mah\u0101bat K. presented as offerings jewels and inlaid vessels to the value of Rs. 60,000. In this country I saw a flower of the redness of fire, of the shape of gul-i-khatmi,** but smaller, and several flowers blooming together in one place, looked from a distance as if they were one flower. Its stem is of the size of the apricot-tree. On the hill-slopes here there are many wild violets,\u2020\u2020 with a very sweet scent, but paler than the violet. On Tuesday, the 21st, marching 3 koss, I halted at the village of M\u0101lgalli.\u2021\u2021 On this day I dismissed Mah\u0101bat K. to his duty in Bangash, and con-\n\n* Elliot, VI. 368 and n. 1. \u2020 Elliot, VI. 368, and note.\n\u2021 Elliot has Haz\u0101ra F\u0101r\u012bgh.\n\u00a7 On the eastern bank of the Dhor.

MS. 181 has Bankli (?) apparently. Pakli is probably not right, for the entrance to it is mentioned lower down.\nferred on him a special elephant and dress of honour with a *p\u016bst\u012bn* (sheepskin coat). This day there was a drizzling rain till the end of the march. On the eve of Wednesday, the 22nd, also there was rain. In the morning snow fell, and as most of the roads had become very slippery, the weak animals fell in every place, and could not rise again, and 25 of my own elephants were lent to assist* them. I halted for two days on account of the snow. On Thursday, the 23rd, Sult\u0101n \u1e24usain, Zamindar of Pakli, had the good fortune to pay his respects: this is the entrance to the Pakli country. It is a strange thing that when H. M. Akbar came here it snowed at this stage, and it has now snowed as well. For many years no snow has fallen, and there has even been little rain. On Friday, the 24th, I marched 4 koss and pitched at the village of Saw\u0101dnagar.\u2020 On this road, too, there was much mud.\u2021 Apricot and peach trees were blooming on all sides, and fir-trees like cypresses rejoiced the eye. On Saturday, the 25th, having marched nearly 3\u00bd koss, the camp was pitched near Pakli. On Sunday, the 26th, I rode out to hunt partridges (*kabak*), and at the end of the day, at the request of Sult\u0101n \u1e24usain, went to his house, and increased his dignity among his equals and neighbours. H. M. Akbar had also gone to his house. He offered several kinds of horses, daggers, hawks, and falcons. I presented him with the horses and daggers. I ordered the hawks and falcons to be got ready\u00a7 (*kamar bar basta*), and shown everything\n\n* Ta\u1e63adduq *shud*. This is how Mr. Rogers has translated the passage, and this seems to me to be right. Elliot has \u201clost,\u201d but surely Jah\u0101ng\u012br would not pass over so lightly the loss of 25 elephants. Ta\u1e63adduq is often used in the sense of almsgiving, or of granting a favour. The text 290, line 2, has *ak\u1e63ar-i-r\u0101h basta b\u016bd*. The word *basta* seems unintelligible, and in the corresponding passage of the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 133, the words are *ak\u1e63ar-i-r\u0101h ajama b\u016bd*. This word perhaps means \u201cmuddy,\u201d and this would fit the sense.\n\n\u2020 Elliot has Taw\u0101dkar.\n\n\u2021 Achamba. But MS. 305 has ajamat, and this may mean forest, or woods. Perhaps Elliot\u2019s \u201cmud\u201d is a clerical error for wood, but *ajamat* means pools as well as woods. Perhaps this is the same word as occurs in the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 135, and means \u201cmuddy.\u201d\n\n\u00a7 So in text, but the MSS. *ba garaz basta* (\u201cloosely tied\u201d), so that they could be thrown off if any game appeared.\nthat might fly up. The Sarkar of Pakli is 35 koss in length and 25 in breadth. On the east, on two sides, is the hill country of Kashmir; on the west, Atak Benares (Atak); on the north, Kator; and on the south, the Gakkar country. At the time when Timur, after conquering Hindustan, turned his rein backwards towards the capital of T\u00fbr\u00e2n, they say that he placed in these regions this body of people, who were in attendance on the victorious stirrup. They say themselves that they are Q\u00e2rluhs, but do not know for certain who was their leader at that time. In fact, they are pure L\u00e2haur\u00ees, and speak the same language. The people of Dhant\u00fbr think the same thing. In the time of my father, one of the name of Sh\u00e2hrukh was Zamindar of Dhant\u00fbr; now it is Bah\u00e2dur, his son. Although they are all related to one another, there are always disputes, as is usual with Zamindars, about boundaries. They have always been loyal. Sult\u00e2n Mahm\u00fbd, the father of Sult\u00e2n Husain, and Sh\u00e2hrukh, both came to wait on me when I was prince. Although Sult\u00e2n Husain is seventy years old, to all outward appearance there is no diminution in his powers, and he can still ride and be as active as possible. In this country they make b\u00fbza (a beverage) from bread and rice, which they call sar.* It is much stronger than b\u00fbza, and the older it is the better. This sar is their chief sustenance. They put this sar into a jar, and fastening it up, keep it for two or three years in the house. Then they take off the scum and call the liquor \u0101chh\u012b. The \u0101chh\u012b can be kept for ten years, and according to them, the older it is the better, and the shortest time in which they use it is a year. Sult\u00e2n Mahm\u00fbd used to take cup after cup of this sar; nay! he would drink a jar of it. Sult\u00e2n Husain is also addicted to it, and brought me some of his choicest quality. I took some in order to try it. I had also drunk it before. Its intoxicating effects are aphrodisiac, but its taste is harsh. It appeared that they mix some bh\u00e2ng (bang) with it, which increases its intoxicating power. If there were no wine, it could in case of necessity be used as a substitute. The fruits are apricots, peaches, and pears (?) (amr\u00fbd).\n\n* Elliot has sir.\nAs they do not cultivate them, but they spring up of themselves, they are harsh-flavoured and unpleasant. Their blossoms are a joy. Their houses are of wood, and are built after the Kashmiri fashion. They have hawks, and horses, camels, cattle, and buffaloes, and many goats and fowls. Their mules are small and are not fit for heavy loads. As it was represented to me that some stages farther on the cultivation was not such as to provide sufficient grain for the royal camp, I gave an order that they should only take a small advanced camp, sufficient for our needs and the necessary establishments, and diminish the number of elephants, and take with them provisions for three or four days; that they should take with them only some of the immediate attendants on the royal stirrup, and that the rest of the men should come on some stages behind under the command of Khw\u0101ja Ab\u016b-l-\u1e24asan, the Bakhshi. In spite of precautions and injunctions, it was found necessary to have 700 elephants for the advanced camp and the establishments.\n\nThe mansab of Sult\u0101n \u1e24usain was 400 personal and 300 horse; I now promoted him to 600 personal and 350 horse, and conferred on him a robe of honour, a jewelled dagger, and an elephant. Bah\u0101dur Dhant\u016br\u012b was an auxiliary of the army of Bangash. An order was given that he should hold the mansab, original and increased, of 200 personal and 100 horse. On Wednesday, the 27th, having marched 5\u00bd koss, and crossing by bridges the Nainsukh,* I chose a halting-place. This Nainsukh (repose of the eyes) flows from the North, and comes down from the hills of D\u0101rd\u2020 (?), which is between the country of Badakhshan and Tibet. As at this place it forms two branches, they had, according to order, prepared two wooden bridges for the crossing of the victorious army, one 18 cubits and the other 14 cubits in length, with a breadth each of 5 cubits. The way in which they make\n\n* Now known as the Kunh\u0101r. It rises in Lake Lohusur at the head of the K\u0101g\u0101n glen.

Briefly, they made the elephants ford, whilst the horsemen and foot passed over by the bridge. Sult\u0101n Mahm\u016bd called this river Nainsukh\u2014that is, \u201cRepose of the eye.\u201d On Thursday, the 30th, having marched about $3\\frac{1}{2}$ koss, a halt was made on the bank of the Kishan Gang\u0101. On this road there is a kotal of great height, the ascent being 1 koss, and the descent $1\\frac{1}{2}$ koss, which they call Pim darang. The reason for this name is that in the language of Kashmir they call cotton (pamba) p\u012bm. As the rulers of Kashmir had placed a superintendent there, who took duties from loads of cotton, and delay takes place here for the collection of the duty, it has become known as the Pim darang\u2020 (cotton delay). After traversing the pass, there is a very fine and clear waterfall. Having drunk my usual cups on the edge of the water in the shade of the trees, I went on to my halting-place in the evening. There was an old bridge over this river, 54 yards long and $1\\frac{1}{2}$ yards wide, which footmen crossed by. According to orders, another bridge was prepared parallel to this, in length 53 yards and breadth 3 yards. As the water was deep and swift, they took the elephants across without loads, and the footmen and horses crossed by the bridge. By order of my father, a very strong saray of stone and lime was erected on the top of the ridge overlooking the river. One day before New Year\u2019s Day we had sent Mu\u2019tamid K. forward to select a spot for the placing of the throne and preparing the New Year\u2019s entertainment. This had to be lofty and choice. By chance, as he crossed the bridge, there was a ridge overlooking the water, green and pleasant. On the top of this was a flat place of 50 cubits which one might say\n\n* Text sh\u0101kh\u1e0d\u0101r (\u201cwith branches\u201d), but the true reading seems to be n\u0101j (\u201cpine\u201d). Elliot has \u201cs\u0101l.\u201d\n\n\u2020 This is a fanciful derivation. The word is not darang, but drang, which means a watch-station. See Stein, A.S.B.J., for 1899, p. 84. The Pamba-drang, however, was near the Kishan Gang\u0101, and so is not the drang mentioned by Stein.\nthe rulers of fate had specially prepared for such a day. The aforesaid officer had made ready everything necessary for the New Year's feast on the top of that ridge, which was much approved. Mu'tamid K. was much applauded for this. The river Kishan Gang\u0101 comes from the south* and flows northwards. The Bihat (Jhelam) comes from the East, and joining the Kishan Gang\u0101, flows to the North.\n\n* A mistake. See Elliot, VI. 373, note.\nTHE FIFTEENTH\nNEW YEAR'S FEAST AFTER THE\nAUSPICIOUS ACCESSION\n\nThe transit of the sun, that fulfils the hopes of the world,\ninto his house of honour in Aries, took place on Friday, the\n15th of the month of Rabi\u2018u-s-sani in the Hijri year 1029,\n(10 March), 1620, after $12\\frac{1}{2}$ gharis, or 5 sidereal hours,* had\npassed, and the 15th year of the reign of this suppliant at the\nthrone of Allah commenced happily and auspiciously. On\nSaturday, the 2nd (Farwardin), having marched $4\\frac{1}{2}$ koss, I\nhalted at the village of Bakkar. On this road there was no\nhill-pass (kotal), but it was rather stony. I saw peacocks,\nblack partridges, and monkeys (langur), such as exist in the\nGarmsir country (Afghanistan). It is evident that these\ncan also exist in cold countries. From this place to\nKashmir the road is along the bank of the river Bihat.\nThere are hills on both sides, and in the bottom of the\nvalley the water flows with great force, boiling and raging.\nHowever large an elephant may be, he cannot hold his feet\nfirmly in it, but immediately rolls over, and is carried away.\nThere are also water-dogs\u2020 in the river. On Sunday, the\n3rd, marching $4\\frac{1}{2}$ koss, I pitched at Musaran. On the eve\nof Friday the merchants who live in the pargana of Bara\nMula came and paid their respects. I asked the reason of\nthe name of Bara mula, and they represented that in the\nHindi language they call a boar Barah (Varaha) and mula\n\n* Each sidereal hour being equal to $2\\frac{1}{2}$ gharis.\n\n\u2020 Sag-i-abhi. Probably otters are meant, as a name for them is\npani kutta (\"water-dogs\"). But in the dictionaries sag-i-abhi is given\nas meaning the beaver. The otter occurs in Kashmir, and is known\nas wudar.

Among the incarnations that belong to the religion of the Hindus, one is the boar incarnation, and B\u0101r\u0101h m\u016bla by constant use has become B\u0101ra m\u016bla. On Monday, the 4th, marching $2\\frac{1}{2}$ koss, I pitched at Bh\u016blb\u0101s. As they said these hills were very narrow and difficult (to pass), and they could be crossed by a crowd of men only with great trouble, I gave orders to Mu\u2018tamid K. that, with the exception of \u0100\u1e63af K. and a few of the necessary attendants, no one should be allowed to march along with the prosperous stirrup (with the king personally), and the camp should be kept one stage behind. By chance, before this order was given, he had sent on his own tent. After this he wrote to his men that this order had been given with regard to him, and they should halt at whatever spot they had reached. His brothers heard this at the foot of the kotal of Bh\u016blb\u0101s,* and pitched their own tent there. When the royal host reached the place, snow and rain began to fall. One plain of the road had not been crossed when his tent became visible. Looking on this as a gift from the hidden world, I and the ladies alighted, and remained protected from the cold and snow and rain. His brothers, according to orders, sent someone in haste to summon him. When the news reached him that the elephants and the advance camp had arrived at the top of the kotal, and blocked up the road, as it was impossible to ride, with great zeal, he, not knowing his head from his feet, traversed a distance of $2\\frac{1}{2}$ koss on foot in two hours, and came to wait on me, and repeated this couplet with the tongue of gesture.\u2020\n\nVerse.\n\n\u201cAt midnight came the thought of thee. I was ashamed and resigned my life.\nThe poor man was abashed when suddenly the guest arrived.\u201d\n\n* Properly B\u00fcliy\u0101sa. See Stein, A.S.B.J., for 1899, p. 85. It is the Peliasa of the maps. Later on, Jah\u0101ng\u012br indicates its position by saying that it is 11 koss on the Kashmir side of the Kishan Gang\u0101.\n\n\u2020 That is, I presume, he did not really utter the words, but his appearance represented them. The Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma has, p. 138, mihm\u0101n ch\u016b Biga (\u201ca guest such as a Begami\u201d). MS. 181 has n\u0101gah ch\u016b\nAll that was in his store (b\u012bs\u0101\u1e6d) in the way of money and goods, of live stock or dead, he offered for me to tread upon. I gave them all back, and said: \u201cWhat do worldly goods appear worth to the eye of our magnanimity? We buy the jewel of loyalty at a high figure. Such an event arising out of his devotion should be reckoned as the rising of his good star, in that a king like me with the people of his harem should remain in his house in comfort and at ease for a night and a day. It would be a cause of honour to him among his contemporaries and comrades.\u201d On Tuesday, the 5th, having traversed 2 koss, I alighted at the village of Kah\u0101\u2019\u012b.* I presented the dress (sar u p\u0101y) I had on to Mu\u2019tamid K., and an order was given assigning him the mansab of 1,500 personal and 1,500\u2020 horse. From this stage we entered within the boundary of Kashm\u012br. In the same kotal of Bh\u016blb\u0101s, Ya\u2018q\u016bb, s. Y\u016bsuf K. Kashm\u012br\u012b, fought with the victorious army of my father, of which R\u0101ja Bhagw\u0101n D\u0101s, father of R\u0101ja M\u0101n Singh, was the leader.\n\nOn this day, the news came that Suhr\u0101b K., s. Rustam Mirz\u0101, had been drowned in the Jhelam. The details are as follows: He, according to orders, was coming up one stage in the rear, and on the road it came into his mind that he would have a bathe in the river, though warm water was ready. The people forbade him, and said that when the air was so cold, unnecessarily to get into a river so agitated and bloodthirsty that it would roll over a war-elephant, was contrary to the dictates of caution. He was not restrained by their words, and as the unavoidable destined time had arrived, got in. From excessive self-will and pride and carelessness, in reliance on his powers of swimming, in which art he was unequalled, he was more determined than ever, and with a khidmat\u012byya (Blochmann 252) and another servant, both of whom could swim, mounted a rock on the river bank\n\n*Sultan. I.O. MS. 305 has n\u0101gah ch\u016b mihm\u0101n. The reading Bega or Begam certainly seems preferable. The text is wrong as usual, and has mih\u0101n (\u201cthe great\u201d), unless it is to be read mah\u0101n, and taken in the sense of Moons\u2014i.e., ladies.\n\n* The Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 139, has Kaht\u0101\u2019\u012b.\n\n\u2020 The Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 139, has 500 horse.\nand threw himself in. Immediately he fell, from the violent movement of the waves, he could not pull himself together or try to swim; to fall in and go were the same thing, and Suhr\u0101b K.* and the khidmat\u012byya thus gave away the goods of their lives to the flood of destruction. The boatman,\u2020 with a hundred difficulties, brought the boat of his being (himself) in safety to the shore. M\u012brz\u0101 Rustam was much attached to this son. On hearing of this fatal news on the P\u016bnch road, he rent the robe of patience, and showed great agitation. With all his dependants, clothed in mourning garments, with head and feet bare, he came to wait on me. What shall I write of the grief of the mother? Although the M\u012brz\u0101 has other sons, his heart was bound up in this one. His age was twenty-six years. In shooting with a gun he was an excellent pupil of his father, and knew well how to drive elephants and carriages. On the expedition to Gujarat he was often ordered to ride on the front part of my private elephant, and he was an active soldier.\u2021\n\nOn Wednesday, the 6th, marching 3 koss, I pitched at the village of R\u012bwand. On Thursday, the 7th, crossing the kotal of Kuw\u0101rmat,\u00a7 which is the most difficult on this road (MS.), I alighted at the village of Wachaha (MS. and print differ). The distance of this stage is $4\\frac{1}{2}$ koss. The kotal of Kuw\u0101rmat (Kul\u0101mat in the MS.) is a difficult one, and is the last of the kotals on the road. On Friday, the 8th, having traversed nearly 4 koss, I halted at the village of Balt\u0101r.|| There was\n\n* The name of M. Rustam\u2019s son, who was drowned.\n\n\u2020 Kush\u1e6digir, which means a wrestler. But Jah\u0101ng\u012br puns on the word as if it were kish\u1e6digir (\u201ca boatman\u201d). Perhaps kush\u1e6digir was his name. I presume that the person meant is the other servant. There was no boat there. The Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma has either kishtigir, or kush\u1e6digir.\n\n\u2021 There is an extraordinary account of the M\u012brz\u0101\u2019s death in Price\u2019s \u201cJahang\u012br\u201d which quite differs from the story told here. See Price, p. 138. It is also stated there that he had been married six months before to a daughter of I\u2019tim\u0101du-d-daula. There is also an account of the accident in the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, p. 139.\n\n\u00a7 Or Kuw\u0101rmast.\n\n|| Perhaps we should read B\u016bniy\u0101r. See Stein, loc. cit., p. 87. Jah\u0101ng\u012br seems to have crossed over to the left bank of the Jhelam in the course of his march. Perhaps he did so at Ooriu of the map (\u016ari). B\u016bniy\u0101r seems to be the Bhaniar of the map. I.O. MS. 181 has Butiy\u0101r.\nno kotal on this road. It was broad, and plain after plain, and mead after mead, of flowers. Sweet-smelling plants of narcissus, violet, and strange flowers that grow in this country, came to view. Among these flowers I saw (noticed especially) one extraordinary one. It had five or six orange flowers blooming with their heads downwards. From the middle of the flowers there came out some green leaves, as in the case* of the pineapple (?). This is the b\u016bl\u0101nik\u2020 flower. There is another flower like the p\u016by (?), round which are small flowers of the shape and colour of the jessamine, some blue in colour and some red, with yellow points in the middle, exceedingly pretty in appearance: its name is \"ladar p\u016bsh.\" They call it p\u016bsh-i-aliyyu-l-\u2018um\u016bm\u2021 (the common p\u016bsh?). There are many yellow arghaw\u0101n (Judas-trees) on the road as well. The flowers of Kashmir are beyond counting and calculation. Which shall I write of? And how many can I describe? I have only mentioned the most remarkable. There is a waterfall on this road, very high and fine. It flows down from a high place. No other waterfall of such beauty was seen on the road. I delayed a moment at it, and filled my eye and heart with gazing on it from a high spot. On Saturday, the 9th, I marched 4\u00be koss, and crossed over at B\u0101ram\u016bla.\u00a7 It is one of the noted towns of Kashmir, and 14 koss|| distant from the city, situated on the bank of the Bihat. A number of the merchants of Kashmir live in it, and have built houses and mosques on the bank of the river, and spend their days in ease and contentment. According to orders, before the arrival of the host of prosperity, they had prepared decorated\n\n* The allusion may be to the tuft of leaves at the top of a pineapple.\n\u2020 Perhaps b\u016bl\u0101 n\u012bk.\n\u2021 P\u016bsh means flower in Kashmiri.

As* the hour for entry (into Srinagar) had been fixed for Monday, when two watches of the day had passed, on Sunday, the 10th, I entered Shih\u0101bu-d-d\u012bn-p\u016br. On this day Dil\u0101war K. K\u0101kar, the Governor of Kashmir, came from Kishtw\u0101r,\u2020 and had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. He was exalted with various royal favours and all kinds of imperial gratifications. He had done his duty here in an acceptable manner, and it is hoped that the great Giver of favours may light up the foreheads of all my servants with honour.\n\nKishtw\u0101r is to the south of Kashmir. From the city of Kashmir (Srinagar) to the stage of Alkah (?),\u2021 which is the capital of Kishtw\u0101r, the distance is 60 koss by measurement. On the 10th of the Il\u0101hi month of Shahriwar, in my 14th year, Dil\u0101war K., with 10,000 horse and foot, determined to conquer Kishtw\u0101r. He appointed his son, \u1e24asan by name, with Gird \u2018Al\u012b M\u012br-b\u0101h\u012br (admiral) to guard the city and administer the territory. And as Gohar Chak and Aiba Chak laid claim to Kashmir as heirs, and were stirring up strife in Kishtw\u0101r, and were wandering in the valley of confusion and ruin, he left Haibat, one of his brothers, with a force at Des\u016b, which is near the kotal of P\u012br Panj\u0101l, by way of caution, and, dividing his forces at that place, he himself hastened with a force by the road of Sang\u012bnp\u016br, sending his son Jal\u0101l, with Na\u1e63ru-llah \u2018Arab, and \u2018Al\u012b Malik Kashm\u012br\u012b, and a band of Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b servants by another road, and his elder son Jam\u0101l with a band of zealous young men as an advanced guard to his own force. At the same time he placed two other forces to move forward on his right and left. As no horses could go on the road, by way of precaution he took some with him, but left\n\n* There is an omission in the text here.

The young men girded the belt of duty on their waists, and went up the hills on foot. The gh\u0101z\u012bs of the army of Islam fought from post to post with the ill-fated unbelievers as far as Narkot, which was one of the enemy's strongholds. There the corps of Jal\u0101l and Jam\u0101l, which had been sent by different roads, met, and the enemy, not having the power to oppose them, took to flight. The brave ones who offered their lives traversed many ups and downs with the courage of determination, and hastened on to the Mar\u016b river. On the bank of that river the fire of slaughter was lighted, and the gh\u0101z\u012bs of the army of Islam displayed approved activity. The ill-fated Aiba Chak, with many of the people of ruin, were slain. By the death of Aiba the Raja became powerless and without heart, and took the road of flight, and, crossing by the bridge, stopped at Bhandarkot, which is on the other side. A band of the brave ones (bah\u0101dur\u0101n) quickly advanced, wishing to cross the bridge. A great fight took place at its head, and some of the young men attained to martyrdom. In this way for twenty days and nights the servants of the Court tried to cross the river, and the unbelievers of darkened fortune did not fail to attack and try to drive them back, until Dil\u0101war K., after establishing th\u0101nas and arranging for the commissariat, arrived with his army. The Raja, by way of stratagem and vulpine trickery, sent his Vakils to Dil\u0101war K., and begged that he might send his brother with offerings to the Court, so that when his offences obtained pardon, and his mind were freed from fear and trouble, he could also himself proceed to the Court, the refuge of the world, and kiss the threshold. Dil\u0101war K. did not lend his ear to these deceitful words, and did not throw away from his hand the coin of opportunity. He dismissed the envoys of the Raja without the attainment of their object, and made every exertion to cross the bridge. His eldest son Jam\u0101l, with a band of the crocodiles of the sea of bravery and valour, went up the river, and by bravely swimming it, although swollen, crossed over, and engaged in\n\n* Dar kull (\"in general, in bulk\") (?).\na fierce battle with the enemy. The devoted servants of the Court made an attack from the other side, and made matters tight for these ruined people. These, when they found they had no longer the strength to oppose them, broke down the planking of the bridge, and took to flight. The victorious servants made the bridge strong again, and transported the remainder of the army. Dil\u0101war Kh\u0101n drew up his forces at Bhandarkot. From the aforesaid river (the Mar\u016b) to the Chen\u0101b, which is a strong support of these unfortunate people, is a distance of two bow-shots, and on the bank of the Chen\u0101b there is a lofty hill. The crossing of the water is a difficult matter, and, with a view to the coming and going of people on foot, they attach strong ropes, and place planks of the width of a cubit between two ropes, and fasten one rope\u2019s end to the top of the hill, and the other on the other side of the water. Then they attach two other ropes\u2014a gaz higher than these, that foot-passengers may place their feet on the planks, and, taking hold of the upper ropes, may descend from the top of the hill to the bottom, and so cross the river. This bridge they call zampa, in the language of the people of the hill country. Wherever they apprehended that a rope bridge might be constructed, they stationed musketeers and archers and men-at-arms, and so felt secure. Dil\u0101war K. made rafts (jh\u0101la), and, placing on them eighty of his valiant young men, sent them across the river at night. As the water was flowing with great violence, the rafts were carried down by the flood of destruction, and sixty-eight of these gallant men were drowned in the sea of non-existence, and obtained the renown of martyrdom, whilst ten, by the aid of swimming, reached the shore of safety (i.e., returned), and two on the other side became prisoners in the hands of the infidels. In short, for four months and ten days Dil\u0101war Kh\u0101n, having planted the foot of courage at Bhandarkot, made endeavours to cross over; but the arrow of stratagem did not reach the target of intent until a Zamindar pointed out a place which the enemy had no idea of. There, having constructed a zampah, in the heart of night, Jal\u0101l, Dil\u0101war K.\u2019s son, with some of the servants of the Court and a band of\nAfghans, about 200 in number, crossed over in safety; made unawares in the morning an attack on the Raja, and blew loudly the trumpets of victory. A few who were around and before the Raja rushed out, bewildered, half asleep and half awake, and most of them became the harvest of the blood-drinking sword, while the rest quickly withdrew themselves from that whirlpool of calamity. In that encounter one of the soldiers came upon the Raja, and wished to finish him with a sword. He called out: \"I am the Raja; take me alive to Dil\u0101war Kh\u0101n.\" The men rushed on him and made him prisoner. After the Raja was made prisoner, his people all fled. When Dil\u0101war Kh\u0101n heard this good news of victory, he prostrated himself in thankfulness to Allah, and, having crossed the river with the victorious army, came to Mandal Badr,* which was the capital of the country, and is 3 koss from the river. The daughter\u2020 of Sangr\u0101m Raja of Jammu, and the daughter of the abandoned S\u016braj Mal, s. R\u0101ja B\u0101so, were in the Raja\u2019s house (i.e., married to him). By Sangr\u0101m\u2019s daughter he had children. Before the victory he had, by way of caution, sent his family for refuge to the Raja of Jasw\u0101l and other Zamindars. When my victorious retinue approached, Dil\u0101war Kh\u0101n, according to order, took the Raja with him, and came to kiss the threshold, leaving Na\u1e63ru-llah \u2018Arab with a body of horse and foot to guard the country.\n\nIn Kishtw\u0101r there are produced much wheat, barley, lentils, millet, and pulse. Differing from Kashmir, it produces little rice. Its saffron is finer than that of Kashmir. About a hundred hawks and falcons are caught there (annually). Oranges, citrons, and water-melons of the finest kind are obtained. Its melons are of the same kind as those of Kashmir, and other fruits, such as grapes, apricots, peaches, and sour pears, are grown. If they were cultivated, it is possible they would improve. A coin\u2021 of the name of sanhasi\u00a7 is a relic of the old rulers of Kashmir, one and a half of which\n\n* The MSS. have also Mandal Badr.

In their business transactions they reckon fifteen sanhas\u012b, or ten rupees, as one p\u0101dsh\u0101h\u012b muhar. They call two seers of Hindustani weight a man (maund). It is not the custom for the Raja to take revenue from cultivation; he takes annually six sanhas\u012b\u2014that is, four rupees\u2014from each house. All the saffron is assigned, as pay, to a body of Rajputs and to 700 musketeers (t\u016bpch\u012b) who are old retainers. When the saffron is sold, four rupees per maund, or two seers, are taken from the purchaser. The whole income of the Raja consists of fines, and for a small offence he takes a heavy sum. From whomsoever is wealthy and in comfortable circumstances the Raja, on some pretext, clears out all that he has. From all sources his income is about Rs. 100,000. In time of war 6,000 or 7,000 men on foot collect together; there are but few horses among them. The Raja and the chief men have about fifty between them. I bestowed a year\u2019s revenue on Dil\u0101war K. by way of reward. By conjecture, his jagir was worth about 1,000 personal and 1,000 horse, according to the Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b rules. When the chief diwans calculate the allowances to the jagirdars, the exact amount will be ascertained.\n\nOn Monday, the 11th, after two watches and four gharis had passed, the royal cort\u00e8ge alighted auspiciously and happily at the buildings lately erected on the bank of the lake (the Dal lake). By order of my father, a very strong fort of stone and lime had been built. It is not quite completed, one side being unfinished. It is hoped that hereafter it will be completed. From \u1e24asan Abd\u0101l to Kashmir by the road I came is a distance of 75 koss; this was accomplished in nineteen marches and six halts\u2014that is, in twenty-five days. From Agra to Kashmir, in the space of 168 days, a distance of 376 koss was traversed in 102 marches and 63 halts. By land* and the ordinary route the distance is 304\u00bd koss.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 12th, Dil\u0101war K., according to order, brought the Raja\u2020 of Kishtw\u0101r, chained, into my presence, and did homage. He (the Raja) is not wanting in dignity.\n\n* Jah\u0101ng\u012br went part of the way by water.\n\u2020 Perhaps he is the Raja Bhagv\u0101n Singh mentioned by Drew in his book on Kashmir, p. 119.\nHis dress is after the Indian fashion, and he knows both the Hindi and the Kashmiri languages. Contrary to other Zamindars of these regions, he looked like the inhabitant of a town. I told him that, notwithstanding his offences, if he would bring his sons to Court, he should be released from confinement, and might live at ease under the shadow of the eternal State, or else he would be imprisoned in one of the forts of Hindustan. He said that he would bring his people, his family, and his sons to wait on me, and was hopeful of my clemency.\n\nI shall now give a brief account of the country of Kashmir and of its peculiarities.\n\nKashmir* belongs to the fourth climate. Its latitude is 35\u00b0 N., and its longitude, from the White Islands, 105\u00b0. In old times the country was in the possession of Rajas. Their dynasty lasted for 4,000 years. An account of them, and a list of their names, are given in the R\u0101ja-tarang, which, by my father\u2019s order, was translated\u2020 from the Sanskrit (Hindi in text) into Persian. In the Hijri year 712 (1312-13) Kashmir was illumined by the religion of Islam. Thirty-two Muhammadan princes reigned over it for 282 years, until, in 994 (1586), my father conquered it. From that date till now, being a period of thirty-five years, the country has been in the possession of the Crown. Kashmir, from the Pass of Buliyasa\u2021 to Qambarbar, is 56 Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b koss long, and its\n\n* Ab\u016b-l-Fa\u017cl, Jarrett, II. 347, puts Kashmir into the third and fourth climates, but at Vol. III., p. 89, he puts Kashmir into the fourth climate. Probably both he and Jah\u0101ng\u012br mean by Kashmir Srinagar. The appellation \u201cWhite Islands\u201d is probably a mistake for \u201cThe Fortunate Islands,\u201d safid (white) being written instead of sa\u02bf\u0101da, which is the word in the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma. Jaz\u0101\u02beir-i-Sa\u02bf\u0101da (\u201cThe Fortunate Isles\u201d) is also the expression used in the Zafar-n\u0101ma, II. 178, which is probably the source of the \u0100y\u012bn and the T\u016bzuk. In the extract from the Zafar-n\u0101ma given in the T. Rash\u012bd\u012b translation, 430, the longitude is given as 105\u00b0 from the \u201cFortunate Islands.\u201d The text of the \u0100y\u012bn, Bib. Ind. edition, II. 42, gives 105\u00b040\u2032 as the longitude.\n\n\u2020 See Rieu, I. 296. The translator was Mull\u0101 Sh\u0101h Muh. of Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d. See also Blochmann, 106.\n\n\u2021 The Peliasa of the maps and the Bolvasaka of Stein. Qambarbar is Far\u016btar in text. The Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 147, has Qambarbar. It is\nbreadth is never more than 27 koss, or less than 10 koss. Shaikh Ab\u016b-l-Fa\u017cl has, in the Akbar-n\u0101ma, stated, by guess and conjecture, that the length of Kashmir from the Kishan Gang\u0101 to Qambarbar is 120 koss, and its breadth from 10 to 25 koss. I, out of prudence and caution, appointed a number of trustworthy and intelligent men to measure the length and breadth with ropes (tan\u0101b). The result was that what the Shaikh wrote as 120 koss came out as 67. As it is agreed that the boundary of a country is the place up to which people speak the language of that country, it follows that the boundary of Kashmir is Buliy\u0101sa, which is 11 koss on this side (i.e., east) of the Kishan Gang\u0101. So, according to the preceding figures, the length of Kashmir is 56 (67\u201411) koss. The variations in breadth were found to be not more than 2 koss. The koss* which is in use during my reign is that prescribed by my father. That is, a koss is 5,000 yards, and the yard is 2 shar\u02bfi yards, each of the latter (yards) being 24 digits\u2020 (angusht). Wherever the koss or gaz is mentioned, the reference is to the above koss and the above gaz. The name of the city is Srinagar, and the Bihat river flows evidently the Qambarber of Jarrett, II. 347 and 361. It lies in the south-east of Kashmir. Measured by the compass, Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s 67 is much more correct than Ab\u016b-l-Fa\u017cl\u2019s 120. The I.G. new edition gives the area of Kashmir and Jammu as 80,900 square miles. Lawrence states the approximate length of the valley as 84 miles, and the breadth as from 20 to 25 miles.\n\n* The word used by Jah\u0101ng\u012br is dara\u02bf, which is given by Steingass as Arabic, and as meaning a yard. Zara\u02bf again, is given as equal to a cubit. Clearly Jah\u0101ng\u012br uses the word here as equivalent to a gaz or yard, for he says that there are 5,000 dara\u02bf in the koss adopted by himself and his father, and Ab\u016b-l-Fa\u017cl in the \u0100y\u012bn (Jarrett, II. 414) says the koss is 5,000 gaz. The word dara\u02bf is also rendered gaz in the Hindustani translation of the Memoirs. There is an important discrepancy between the two I.O. MSS. and the printed text of the Memoirs. The former, instead of saying that the dara\u02bf or yard is = 2 shar\u02bfi dara\u02bf, say that 1\u00bd dara\u02bf are = 2 shar\u02bfi dara\u02bf. In the \u0100y\u012bn (Jarrett, II. 417) the gaz is given as equal to 24 digits. See later on, p. 303 of text, where, in describing Sh\u0101h Shuj\u0101\u02bes accident, 7 dara\u02bf are said to be equal to 10 shar\u02bfi, or ordinary, gaz.\n\n\u2020 See text (thirteenth year), p. 234, where it is stated that the Il\u0101hi gaz is 40 finger-breadths.\nthrough the midst of it. They call its fountain-head V\u012br-n\u0101g.* It is 14 koss to the south. By my order they have made a building and a garden at that source. There have been built in the city four very strong stone and wooden bridges, over which people come and go. They call a bridge in the language of this country kadal. There is a very lofty mosque in the city, one of the marks of Sult\u0101n Sikandar,\u2020 made in 795 (1393). After a time it was burnt, but was rebuilt by Sult\u0101n \u1e24usain. It had not been completed when the mansion of his life fell down. In 909 (1503-04) Ibr\u0101h\u012bm M\u0101qr\u012b, Vizier of Sult\u0101n \u1e24usain, finished it handsomely. From that day till now it is 120 years since it has been in existence. From the Mihr\u0101b to the eastern wall it is 145 yards, and its breadth is 144 yards, containing four (t\u0101q) alcoves. On all sides of the hall they have erected beautiful cloisters and pillars. In short, no better memorial of the rulers of Kashmir has been left than this. Mir Sayyid \u2018Al\u012b of Hamadan (may his grave be sanctified!) was for some time in this city. There is a monastery\u2021 to his memory. Near the city there are two\u00a7 large lakes full of water all the year round. Their flavour|| does not vary; they are the means for coming and going of the people, and for the conveyance of grain and firewood on boats. In the city and parganas there are 5,700 boats, with 7,400\u00b6 boatmen.\n\n* V\u012br is willow, so V\u012br-n\u0101g means Willow-fountain.\n\u2020 Jarrett, II. 387. The I.G., XXIII. 100, says it was built by Zainu-l-\u2018\u0101bid\u012bn. The inscription shows that Zainu-l-\u2018\u0101bid\u012bn built it (Lawrence, 290). It is stated there that it was also burnt in 1029, A.H.\u2014i.e., in the year of Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s visit.\n\u2021 Kh\u0101naq\u0101h\u012b. Lawrence, 292.\n\u00a7 So in text and MSS., but perhaps d\u016b is a mistake for Dal. However, the I.G. speaks of two lakes, the Dal and the Anchar (north of Srinagar). See also Lawrence, 20 and 36.\n|| Probably the meaning is that the water never causes indigestion. Ab\u016b-l-Fa\u1e93l speaks of the streams being kh\u016bsh-guw\u0101r\u2014i.e., their water is digestible.\n\u00b6 The number of boatmen, when compared with the number of boats, seems very small, but the figures are the same in the I.O. MSS. and in the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 149. Perhaps the word b\u012bst, 20, has been omitted, and we should read 27,400 boatmen. Lawrence states the number of boatmen at 33,870, and the boats, exclusive of private\nThe country of Kashmir has thirty-eight parganas. It is divided into two provinces; the territory on the upper part of the river they call Marr\u0101j, and that on the lower K\u0101mr\u0101j. It is not the custom to use gold and silver for payment of the revenue from land or in commerce, except for a portion of the cesses (sa\u02bfir-jih\u0101t).* They reckon the value of things in kharw\u0101rs of rice, each kharw\u0101r being three maunds and eight seers of the current weight. The Kashmiris reckon two seers as one maund, and four maunds, or eight seers, make one tark. The revenue of Kashmir is 30,63,050 kharw\u0101rs and 11 tarks, which in cash represents 7,46,70,000 d\u0101ms. Ordinarily it maintains 8,500 horse. It is very difficult to enter Kashmir. The routes by Bhimbhar\u2020 and Pakl\u012b are the best. Though that by Bhimbhar is the shorter, yet if one wishes to find spring in Kashmir, he is confined to the road by Pakl\u012b, for the other roads at this season are blocked with snow. If one were to take to praise Kashmir, whole books would have to be written. Accordingly a mere summary will be recorded.\n\nKashmir is a garden\u2021 of eternal spring, or an iron fort to a palace of kings\u2014a delightful flower-bed, and a heart-expanding heritage for dervishes. Its pleasant meads and enchanting cascades are beyond all description. There are running streams and fountains beyond count. Wherever the eye reaches, there are verdure and running water. The red rose, the violet, and the narcissus grow of themselves; in the fields,\n\n* Compare Jarrett, II. 366. \u201cSome part of the Sair Jihat cesses are taken in cash.\u201d\n\u2020 Jarrett, II. 347.\n\u2021 Compare Jarrett, II. 348, where we have \u201cthe country is enchanting, and might be fittingly called a garden of perpetual spring surrounding a citadel terraced to the skies.\u201d\n\nones, at 2,417. The revenue of Kashmir, as stated by Jah\u0101ng\u012br, is that mentioned in the \u0100y\u012bn, Jarrett, II. 366, and is according to the assessment of Q\u0101z\u012b \u2019\u0100l\u012b. In the two I.O. MSS. the corresponding number of d\u0101ms is given as 7,46,70,400 (Rs. 1,866,760), being only 11 less than that given in Jarrett, II. 367, line 3. The figures given in Lawrence, 234, are taken apparently from the Persian text (compare Bib. Ind. edition, I. 571), corresponding to Jarrett, II. 368. The pargana Der, which Lawrence failed to trace, is a mistake for the well-known Ver, dal having been written or read by mistake for wa.\nthere are all kinds of flowers and all sorts of sweet-scented herbs more than can be calculated. In the soul-enchanting spring the hills and plains are filled with blossoms; the gates, the walls, the courts, the roofs, are lighted up by the torches of banquet-adorning tulips. What shall we say of these things or of the wide meadows (julgah\u0101) and the fragrant trefoil?\n\nVerse.\n\n\"The garden-nymphs* were brilliant,\nTheir cheeks shone like lamps;\nThere were fragrant buds on their stems (or 'under their rind'),\nLike dark amulets on the arms of the beloved.\nThe wakeful, ode-rehearsing nightingale\nWhetted the desires of wine-drinkers;\nAt each fountain the duck dipped his beak\nLike golden scissors cutting silk;\nThere were flower-carpets and fresh rosebuds,\nThe wind fanned the lamps of the roses,\nThe violet braided her locks,\nThe buds tied a knot in the heart.\"\n\nThe finest inflorescence is that of the almond and the peach. Outside the hill-country the commencement of blossoming is the 1st Isfand\u0101rmuz (February 10). In the territory of Kashmir it is 1st Farwardin (March 10), and in the city gardens it is the 9th and 10th of that month, and the end of their blooming joins on to the commencement of that of the blue jessamine. In attendance on my revered father I frequently went round the saffron fields, and beheld the spectacle of the autumn. Thank God that on this occasion I beheld the beauties\u2020 of the spring. The beauties of the autumn shall be described in their place. The buildings of Kashmir are all of wood; they make them two-, three-, and four-storied, and covering the roofs with earth, they plant bulbs of the chaugh\u0101sh\u2021 tulip, which blooms year after year\n\n* That is, the flowers.\n\u2020 Text jaw\u0101nih\u0101, but I.O. MSS. have kh\u016bbih\u0101.\n\u2021 Apparently the proper spelling is j\u016bgh\u0101shi. See Vullers' s. v. and Bah\u0101r-i-\u2018ajam, 368, col. a. It is a black tulip. Sir George King thought it might be the Fritillaria imperialis. See Jarrett, 349, and n. 1.\nin the spring season, and is exceedingly beautiful. This custom is peculiar to the people of Kashmir. This year, in the little garden* of the palace and on the roof of the chief mosque, the tulips blossomed luxuriantly. There are many blue jessamines in the gardens, and the white jessamines that the people of India call chamb\u012bt\u012b are sweet-scented. Another kind is of the colour of sandal-wood, and this is also very sweet-scented. This is special to Kashmir. I saw several sorts of red roses: one is specially sweet-scented, and another is a flower of the colour of sandal (light yellow), with an exceedingly delicate scent. It (the scent ?) is of the nature of (that of) the red rose, and its stem is like that of the red rose. There are two kinds of lilies. That which is grown in gardens is vigorous (b\u0101l\u016bda) and fresh (lit. green) coloured, the other is a wild kind. Although the latter has less colour it is very sweet-scented. The flower of the Ja\u02bffari\u2020 (a yellow flower) is large and sweet-scented; its stem is above a man\u2019s height, but in some years, when it has grown large and has flowered, a worm is produced, and spreads over the flower a kind of spider\u2019s web, and destroys it and dries up its stem. This year it has so happened. The flowers that are seen in the territories of Kashmir are beyond all calculation. Those that N\u0101diru-l-\u02bfa\u1e63r\u012b Ust\u0101d Man\u1e63\u016br\u2021 has painted are more than 100. Before my father\u2019s time there were no sh\u0101h-\u0101l\u016b (cherries).\u00a7 Mu\u1e25ammad|| Qul\u012b Afsh\u0101r brought them from Kabul and planted them, and there are now ten or fifteen fruit-bearing trees. There were also some apricot-trees. The aforesaid made them known in this country, and now there are many of them. In fact, the apricot\u00b6 of Kashmir is good.\n\n* N\u016br-afz\u0101 garden.

Ab\u016b-l-Fa\u1e93l, \u0100y\u012bn, Blochmann, 65, speaks of cherries coming from Kabul. But cherries both sweet and sour are mentioned in the T. Rash\u012bd\u012b as growing in Kashmir (Translation, p. 425).\n\u00b6 Zard-\u0101l\u016b-i-paiwand\u012b.\nThere was a tree in the Shahr-\u0101r\u0101 garden at Kabul, called Mirz\u0101\u012b, better fruit than which I had not eaten, but in Kashmir there are trees equal to this in the gardens. There are pears (n\u0101shp\u0101t\u012b) of the best kind, better than those of Kabul, or Badakhshan, and nearly equal to those of Samar-kand. The apples of Kashmir are celebrated for their goodness. The guavas (amr\u016bd) are middling. Grapes are plentiful, but most of them are harsh and inferior, and the pomegranates are not worth much. Water-melons of the best kind can be obtained. The melons are very sweet and creased, (? shikananda)*, but for the most part when they become ripe a worm is found in them that spoils them. If by chance they are preserved from this misfortune they are very delicate. There are no sh\u0101h-t\u016bt\u2020 (some kind of large mulberry), but there are other (t\u016bt) mulberries everywhere. From the foot of every mulberry-tree a vine-creeper grows\u2021 up. In fact, the mulberries of Kashmir are not fit to eat, with the exception of some on trees grown in gardens, but the leaves are used to feed the silkworm. They bring the silkworms\u2019 eggs from Gilgit and Tibet. There is plenty of wine and vinegar, but the wine is sour and inferior, and in the Kashmir language is called mas. After they take cups of it some heat of head ensues. They make various pickles with the vinegar. As the garlic of Kashmir is good, the best pickle is that of garlic. There are all kinds of crops except peas. If they sow peas, they give a crop the first year, in the second they are inferior, and in the third year they are like mushang.\u00a7 Rice is the principal crop. Probably there are three parts under rice and one under all other grains. The chief food of the people of Kashmir is rice, but it is inferior. They boil it fresh,|| and allow it to get cold, and then eat it, and call it batha. It is not usual to\n\n* Shikananda, query, melting. The word occurs also in Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 152.

Salt is brought from India. It is not the custom to put salt into the *batha*. They boil vegetables in water, and throw in a little salt in order to alter the flavour, and then eat them along with the *batha*. Those who want to have something tasty put a little walnut-oil into the vegetables. Walnut-oil soon becomes bitter and evil-flavoured. They also use cow-oil (*raughan*\u2014i.e., *gh\u012b*), but this is taken fresh, and fresh from newly-made butter (*maska*). They throw this into the food, and call it \"sad\u0101-p\u0101k\" in the Kashmiri language. As the atmosphere is cold and damp, it becomes altered by being kept for three or four days. There are no buffaloes, and the cattle are small and inferior. The wheat* is small and of little substance (*kam maghz*). It is not the custom to eat bread (*n\u0101n*). There are tailless sheep, resembling the *kadi\u2020* (or *gadd\u012b*) of India. They are called *hand\u016b*, and their flesh is not without flavour. Fowls, geese, and ducks (*murgh\u0101b\u012b*)\u2014golden and others\u2014are plentiful. There are all kinds of fish, both with and without scales, but they are inferior. The woollen cloths are well known. Men and women wear a woollen tunic (*kurt\u0101*), and call it *pat\u1e6d\u016b*. If they do not put on a tunic, they believe that the air affects them, and even that it is impossible to digest their food without it. The shawls of Kashmir, to which my father gave the name of *parm-narm*, are very famous: there is no need to praise them. Another kind is *taharma* (*naharma* in the printed version); it is thicker than a shawl, and soft.\u2021\n\n* The sentence about wheat is omitted in the text.\n\n\u2020 Text *k\u016bh\u012b* (\"hill\"); but this is opposed to the MSS and also to the \u0100yin-i-Akbar\u012b which Jahangir is evidently copying. See Jarrett, II. 350, and n. 3, and Persian text, I. 563. The I.O. MSS. of T\u016bzuk have *kadd\u012b* or *gadd\u012b*. *Gadd\u012b* is the name of a pastoral tribe (see Lawrence, 12), and there is a Turkish word *ked\u012b* meaning a cat, and a word *gadd\u012b* which means \"horned.\" The Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 153, has \"kadi-i-Hindust\u0101n.\" Jarrett, loc. cit, states that *hand\u016b* in Kashmiri means a domestic ram. The word for tailless is *b\u012b-dumba*, and perhaps means that the sheep have not the enormously thick tails of some kinds of hill sheep.\n\n\u2021 Possibly *nahrma* (\"like a river\"), is right, for the garment is said to be *mauj-d\u0101r* (\"having waves\"). The word *mauj-d\u0101r* occurs in the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 153, and in the two I.O. MSS.\nAnother is called *darma*. It is like a *jul-i-khirsak,* and is put over carpets. With the exception of shawls they make other woollen materials better in Tibet. Though they bring the wool for the shawls from Tibet they do not make them there. The wool for shawls comes from a goat which is peculiar to Tibet. In Kashmir they weave the *patt\u016b* shawl from wool, and sewing two shawls together they smooth them into a kind of *saqarl\u0101t* (broad-cloth), which is not bad for a rain-coat. The men of Kashmir shave the head and put on a round turban, and the common women do not wear clean, washed clothes. They use a tunic of *patt\u016b* for three or four years; they bring it unwashed from the house of the weaver, and sew it into a tunic, and it does not reach the water till it falls to pieces. It is considered wrong to wear drawers (*iz\u0101r*); they wear the tunic long and ample as far as the head and falling down to the feet, and they also wear\u2020 a belt. Although most of the houses are on the river-bank not a drop of water touches their bodies. In short, they are as dirty outside as inside, without any cleanliness. In the time of M\u012brz\u0101 \u1e24aidar there were many skilled people there. They were skilled in music, and their lutes, dulcimers, harps, drums, and flutes were celebrated. In former times they had a musical instrument like a lute, and used to sing in the Kashmiri language compositions according to Hindi musical modes, there being even two or three modes combined together. Moreover, many sing together in chorus. In fact, Kashmir is much indebted to M\u012brz\u0101 \u1e24aidar for its excellencies. Before the reign of my father the chief method by which the people of these parts rode was on *g\u016bnts* (ponies). They had no large horses, but used to bring \u2018Ir\u0101q and Turki horses by way of rare gifts for their rulers. *G\u016bnt* means a *y\u0101b\u016b\u2020* (pony).\n\n*Jul* is a coverlet, and *khirsak* means a little bear, but is applied to a rough woollen coverlet\u2014a drugget. *Darma* is a name in Bengal for a reed mat.\n\n\u2020 Perhaps \u201ctie it at the waist.\u201d But see Lawrence, 252: \u201cThe Panditana wears a girdle, but no drawers.\u201d\n\n\u2020 The MSS. have *tat\u1e6d\u016b*. Both they and the text have also the words *chah\u0101r sh\u0101na ba-zam\u012bn nazd\u012bk*. *Chah\u0101r sh\u0101na* means a dwarf. Literally it means \u201cfour shoulders,\u201d and Vullers following, the Bah\u0101r-i-\nThey have thick shoulders, and are low in the body. They are common in other of the hill-countries of India. For the most part they are vicious* and hard-mouthed. When this God-created flower-garden acquired eternal beauty under the auspices of the State, and by the blessing of the teaching of the Alexander-minded Kh\u0101q\u0101n, many of the Aim\u0101qs (cavalry) were presented with jagirs in this Subah, and herds of \u2018Ir\u0101qi and Turk\u012b horses were given them to breed from (k\u012bh kurra bag\u012brand). The soldiers also brought horses\u2020 on their own account, and in a short time horses were obtainable, so that many Kashmiri horses were bought and sold for 200 and Rs. 300, and even for Rs. 1,000.\n\nThe merchants and artificers of this country are mostly Sunnis, while the soldiers are Im\u0101miyya Shias. There is also the sect of N\u016br-bakhsh\u012bs.\u00a7 There is also a body of Faqirs whom they call R\u012bsh\u012bs.\u00a7 Though they have not religious knowledge or learning of any sort, yet they possess simplicity, and are without pretence.

Evidently the words ba-zamin nazdik are meant as an explanation or addition to Chah\u0101r-sh\u0101na, and signify that the y\u0101b\u016b or tatt\u016b has his withers near the ground. The words also occur in the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 154.\n\n\u2020 Text ilch\u012b-i-s\u0101m\u0101n.

There are about 2,000 of these people. There is also a body of brahmans living from of old in this country, who still remain there and talk in the Kashmiri tongue. Outwardly one cannot distinguish them from Mussulmans. They have, however, books in the Sanskrit language, and read them. They carry into practice whatever relates to the worship of idols. Sanskrit is a language in which the learned of India have composed books, and esteem them greatly. The lofty idol temples which were built before the manifestation of Islam are still in existence, and are all built of stones, which from foundation to roof are large, and weigh 30 or 40 maunds, placed one on the other. Near the city there is a small hill which they call K\u016bh-i-M\u0101r\u0101n* (\"The Wicked Hill,\" Lawrence 298), as well as Har\u012b Parbat. On the east side of the hill there is the Dal Lake, which measures round a little more than $6\\frac{1}{2}$ koss.\u2020 My father (may the lights of Allah be his testimony!) gave an order that they should build in this place a very strong fort of stone and lime; this has been nearly completed during the reign of this suppliant, so that the little hill has been brought into the midst of the fortifications, and the wall of the fort built round it. The lake is close to the fort, and the palace overlooks the water. In the palace there was a little garden, with a small building in it in which my revered father used constantly to sit. At this period it appeared to me to be very much out of order and ruinous. As it was the place where that veritable qibla (place turned towards in prayer) and visible Deity used to sit, and it is really a place of prostration for this suppliant, therefore its neglected state did not appear right to me. I ordered Mu'tamid K., who is a servant who knows my temperament,\n\n* Text B\u0101r\u0101n. MSS. have M\u0101r\u0101n, and Eastwick has Koh-i-Mahran. He calls it an isolated hill 250 feet high. It is on the north outskirts of the city. See also Lawrence, 184, and n. 2, and Stein, 147-48.\n\n\u2020 The Dal Lake is 3\u00b787 miles long and 2\u00b758 broad, the \u0100nchar Dal is 3\u00b751 miles long and 2\u00b715 broad. Lawrence, 20.\nto make every effort to put the little garden in order and repair the buildings. In a short space of time, through his great assiduity, it acquired new beauty. In the garden he put up a lofty terrace 32 yards square, in three divisions (q\u012b\u1e6d\u02bfa), and having repaired the building he adorned it with pictures by masterhands, and so made it the envy of the picture gallery of China. I called this garden N\u016br-afz\u0101 (light increasing).\n\nOn Friday, the 15th of the Divine month of Farward\u012bn, two q\u016b\u1e6d\u0101s oxen, out of the offerings of the Zamindar of Tibet, were brought before me. In form and appearance they closely resemble the buffalo. All the limbs are covered with wool which properly belongs to animals in a cold country. For instance, the rang goats (ibex), which they brought from the country of Bhakkar (Sind) and the hill-country of the Garms\u012br (in Afghanistan) were very handsome, and had but little wool, and those that are met with in these hills, on account of the excessive cold and snow, are covered with hair and ugly. The Kashmiris call the rang kapal.* On this day they brought a musk deer as an offering. As I had not tasted its flesh, I ordered it to be cooked; it appeared very tasteless and bad for food. The flesh of no other wild animal is so inferior. The musk-bag when fresh has no scent, but when it is left for some days and becomes dry, it is sweet-scented. The female has no musk-bag. In these two or three days I frequently embarked in a boat, and was delighted to go\u2020 round and look at the flowers of Ph\u0101k and Sh\u0101lam\u0101r. Ph\u0101k is the name of a pargana situated on the other side of the lake. Sh\u0101lam\u0101r is near the lake. It has a pleasant stream, which comes down from the hills, and flows into the Dal Lake. I bade my son Khurr\u0101m dam it up and make a waterfall, which it would be a pleasure to behold. This place is one of the sights of Kashmir.\n\nOn Sunday, the 17th, a strange affair took place. Sh\u0101h Shuja\u02bf was playing in the buildings of the palace. By chance there was a window with a screen in front of it looking towards\n\n* MSS. have k\u012bl, and so has the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma. K\u012bl is given in Lawrence, 114, as the Kashmir name for the ibex.\n\u2020 Jarrett, II. 360.\nthe river. They had put a screen in front, but had not fastened the door, and the prince in play went towards the window to look out. As soon as he arrived there he fell headlong. By chance they had laid down a carpet below the wall, and a farr\u0101sh (carpet-spreader) was sitting near it. The child\u2019s head fell on this carpet, and his feet on the back and shoulders of the farr\u0101sh, and so came to the ground. Though the height was 7 yards* (dara\u2018), the compassion of God, the Great and Glorious, came to his aid, and the carpet and the farr\u0101sh became the means of saving his life. God forbid, but if it had not been so it would have been a serious matter for him. At the time R\u0101y M\u0101n, the head of the Khidmatiyya\u2020 piy\u0101das, was standing below the jharoka. He immediately ran and picked him up, and holding him in his arms, was taking him upstairs. In that condition he asked: \u201cWhither are you carrying me?\u201d He replied: \u201cInto the presence of His Majesty.\u201d Then weakness overcame him, and he could speak no more. I was lying down when this alarming news reached me, and ran out in a state of bewilderment. When I saw him in this state my senses forsook me, and for a long time holding him in my affectionate embrace I was distracted with this favour from Allah. When a child of four years of age falls headlong from a place ten ordinary (shar\u2018i) gaz in height, and no harm happens to his limbs, it is a cause for amazement. Having performed my prostrations for this fresh act of goodness, I distributed alms, and ordered that deserving people and the poor who lived in the city should be brought before me in order that I might assure them their means of livelihood. A strange thing was that three or four months before this event Jotik R\u0101y, the astrologer, who is one of the most skilled of the class in astrology, had represented to me, without any intermediary, that it was predicted from the Prince\u2019s horoscope that these three or four months were unpropitious to him, and it was possible he might fall down from some high place, but that the dust of calamity would not settle on the skirt of his life. As his prognostications had repeatedly proved correct, this dread dwelt in\n\n* This is the Il\u0101hi gaz. \u2020 Blochmann, 252, and note.\nmy mind, and on these dangerous roads and difficult mountain passes I was never for a moment forgetful of that nursling of the parterre of Fortune. I continually kept him in sight, and took the greatest precautions with regard to him. When I arrived in Kashmir this unavoidable* catastrophe occurred. His nurses (anagah\u0101) and wet-nurses must have been very careless. God be praised that it ended well!\n\nIn the garden of \u2018Aish\u0101b\u0101d\u2020 (abode of pleasure) I saw a tree which had numerous\u2021 blossoms. They were very large and beautiful, but the apples that the tree produced were bitter.\n\nAs excellent service had been done by Dil\u0101war K. K\u0101kar, I promoted him to the mansab of 4,000 personal and 3,000 horse, and also conferred mansabs on his sons. Shaikh Far\u012bd, s. Qu\u1e6dbu-d-d\u012bn K. was raised to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 400 horse. The mansab of Sar-bar\u0101h K. was ordered to be 700 personal and 250 horse, and I promoted N\u016bru-llah Kurk\u012br\u0101q (in charge of furriery ?) to that of 600 personal and 100 horse, bestowing on him the title of Tashrif K. The offerings of Thursday, the 21st, were handed over as a reward to Qiy\u0101m K., the chief huntsman. As Allah-d\u0101d Afghan, s. the T\u0101r\u012bk\u012b,\u00a7 had repented of his evil deeds and come to Court at the request of I\u2019tm\u0101du-d-daula I pardoned his offences; the signs of disgrace and shame were evident on his forehead and, according to the previous arrangement, I bestowed on him the mansab of 2,500 and 200 horse. M\u012brak Jal\u0101yir, one of the auxiliaries of Bengal, was promoted to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 400 horse.\n\nAs it was reported that the j\u016bgh\u0101s\u012b (i.e., black) tulips were in good bloom on the roof of the J\u0101mi\u2019 mosque, on Saturday, the 23rd, I went to see them.

(text has Maud Mihri), which previously to this had been granted to R\u0101ja B\u0101so, and afterwards continued to his rebel son S\u016braj Mal, were now bestowed on Jagat Singh, his brother, who had not obtained the t\u012bka (mark of royal succession), and I gave the pargana of Jamm\u016b to R\u0101ja Sangr\u0101m. On Monday, the 1st of Urdibihisht, I went to the house of Khurram, and entered his bath-house, and when I came out he presented his offerings. Of these I accepted a trifle in order to please him. On Thursday, the 4th, Mir Jumla was promoted to the mansab of 2,000 personal and 300 horse. On Sunday, the 7th, I rode to the village of Ch\u0101rdara,\u2020 which is the native country of \u1e24aidar Malik, to hunt partridges. In truth this is a very pleasant spot of ground, and has flowing streams and lofty plane-trees. At his request I gave it the name of N\u016brp\u016br\u2021 (city of light). On the road there was a tree\u00a7 called halthal; when one takes one of the branches and shakes it, the whole of the tree comes into movement. The common people believe that this movement is peculiar to that tree. By chance in the said village I saw another tree of the same kind, which was in similar movement, and I ascertained that it was common to that species of tree, and not confined to one tree. In the village of R\u0101walp\u016br, 2\u00bd koss from the city towards Hindustan, there is a plane-tree, burnt in the inside. Twenty-five years before this, when I myself\n\n* There are different readings. No. 181 has Maud and Mihri.

The place was Kh\u0101np\u016br or near it. Perhaps the tree is the Adansonia. See also Jarrett, II. 363. According to Stein, 191, Halthal is the name of the village, and is a corruption of Salasthala. This agrees with the \u0100y\u012bn I. 569, but not with Akbar-n\u0101ma III. 542, where halthal is given as the name of the tree.\nwas riding on a horse, with five other saddled horses and two eunuchs, we went inside it. Whenever I had chanced to mention this people were surprised. This time I again ordered some of the men to go inside, and what I had in my mind came to pass in the same manner. It has been noted in the Akbar-n\u0101ma that my father took* thirty-four people inside and made them stand close to each other.\n\nOn this day it was represented to me that Prith\u012b-chand, s. R\u0101y Manohar, who was one of the auxiliaries of the army against K\u0101ngra, had sacrificed his life in a useless (b\u012b-\u1e63arfa\u2020) battle with the enemy.\n\nOn Thursday, the 11th, certain servants of the State were promoted in the following manner: T\u0101t\u0101r K. to 2,000 personal and 500 horse; \u2018Abdu-l-\u2018Az\u012bz K. to 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse; Deb\u012b Chand of Gwalior to 1,500 personal and 500 horse; M\u012br Kh\u0101n, s. Ab\u016b-l-Q\u0101sim K. Namak\u012bn to 1,000 personal and 600 horse; M\u012brz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad to 700 personal and 300 horse; Lu\u1e6df\u016b-llah to 300 personal and 500 horse; Na\u1e63ru-llah \u2018Arab to 500 personal and 250 horse; and Tahawwur K. was appointed to the faujdarship of Mew\u0101t. On Thursday, the 25th, Sayyid B\u0101yaz\u012bd Bukh\u0101r\u012b, faujdar of Bhakkar, raised his head of honour with the Subadarship of Sind, and his mansab, original and increased, was fixed at 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse, and he was also presented with a standard. Shaj\u0101\u2018at K. \u2018Arab obtained the honour of exaltation to the mansab of 2,500 personal and 2,000 horse. An\u012br\u0101\u2019i Singh-dalan, at the request of Mah\u0101bat K., was appointed to Bangash. J\u0101n-sip\u0101r K. was promoted to the mansab of 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse.\n\nAt this time, on the representation of the Commander-in-Chief, Kh\u0101n-Kh\u0101n\u0101n, and all the loyal people, it was shown to me that \u2018Ambar, the black-fated one (he was an Abyssinian), had again placed his foot beyond the bounds of good behaviour,\n\n* I have not found this passage in the Akbar-n\u0101ma. The Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 159, says that 70 people stood erect inside of the trunk. R\u0101wal-p\u016br is marked on the map of Kashmir, a little to the south of Srinagar. Ni\u1e93\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn, in his chapter on Kashmir in the \u1e6cabaq\u0101t-i-Akbar\u012b, speaks of a tree under the shade of which 200 horsemen could stand.\n\n\u2020 Possibly b\u012b-\u1e63arfa only means \u201cunsuccessful.\u201d But it is used lower down (text 308, line 8), in the sense of immoderate or unprofitable.\nand had, according to his nature, laid a foundation for trouble and sedition, and as the victorious army had proceeded to a distant part of the country, he, considering it a good opportunity, had broken the pledges he had given to the servants of the Court, and had stretched out his hand to take possession of royal territory. It is hoped that he will soon be entangled in the disgrace of his deeds. As he (the Commander-in-Chief) had asked for treasure, it was ordered that the diwans of Agra should send Rs. 20,00,000 to the Commander-in-Chief. Close upon this news came that the Amirs had left their posts, and come together to D\u0101r\u0101b K., and that the Barg\u012bs* (the Mah-rattas) were surrounding his camp, and that Khanjar K. had taken refuge in Ahmadnagar. Two or three battles had already taken place between the rebels and the servants of the Court, and each time the enemy had been defeated, and many of them killed. On the last occasion D\u0101r\u0101b K., taking with him well-mounted young men, attacked the rebels' camp. A fierce battle ensued, and the enemy being defeated turned the face of ruin towards the valley of flight. Their camp had been plundered, and the victorious army had returned in safety to their camp. As difficulty and distress had fallen on the victorious army, those who were loyal came to the conclusion that they should go down by the Pass of Rohangar\u1e25\u2020 and remain below the gh\u0101t, so that forage and grain might be easily obtained, and the men not incur any labour or distress. Having no choice, they prepared the army of prosperity at B\u0101l\u0101p\u016br, and the rebels of black fortune, with impertinence and importunity, appeared near B\u0101l\u0101p\u016br. R\u0101ja Bir Singh Deo, with some of the devoted servants, plucking up courage in order to beat back the enemy, slew many of them. An Abyssinian of the name of Man\u1e63\u016br, who was in the rebel army, fell into their hands, and although they wished to put him on an elephant (see Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma 161, the text wrongly has z\u012br \"under\"), he would not agree, and was insolent.\u2021 R\u0101ja Bir Singh Deo ordered them to separate his\n\n* Text has Turks (Turkiy\u0101n).\n\u2020 Apparently the Rohankhed of I.G., XXI. 304.\n\u2021 Literally, \"raised the foot of ignorance.\"\nhead from his body. It is hoped that the circling sphere will lay the recompense of improper deeds on the skirt of life of all who do not recognize the right.\n\nOn the 3rd Urdibihisht I rode to see the Sukh N\u0101g.* It is a beautiful summer residence (il\u0101q). This waterfall is in the midst of a valley, and flows down from a lofty place. There was still ice on its sides. The entertainment of Thursday was arranged for in that flower-land, and I was delighted at drinking my usual cups on the edge of the water. In this stream I saw a bird like a s\u0101j.\u2020 A s\u0101j is of a black colour and has white spots, while this bird is of the same colour as a bulbul with white spots, and it dives and remains for a long time underneath, and then comes up from a different place. I ordered them to catch and bring two or three of these birds, that I might ascertain whether they were waterfowl and were web-footed, or had open feet like land birds. They caught two and brought them. One died immediately, and the other lived for a day. Its feet were not webbed like a duck\u2019s. I ordered N\u0101diru-l-\u2018a\u1e63r Ust\u0101d Man\u1e63\u016br to draw its likeness. The Kashmiris call it galkar\u2021\u2014that is, \u201cwater s\u0101j.\u201d\n\nOn this day the Qazi and the Chief Justice represented to me that \u2018Abdu-l-Wahh\u0101b, the son of \u1e24ak\u012bm \u2018Al\u012b, claimed Rs. 80,000 from the Sayyids of Lahore, and produced a bond with the seal of Q\u0101\u1e93\u012b N\u016bru-ll\u0101h. He said that his father had placed that sum in deposit with S\u0101yyid Wali, the father of these men, who denied it.\u00a7 If an order were given, the\n\n* Perhaps Sukh N\u0101g is the Shakar N\u0101g of Jarrett, II. 361. The Sukh N\u0101g River is mentioned in Lawrence, 16. It may also be the waterfall mentioned by Bernier, which he says Jahangir visited and levelled a rock in order to see properly.\n\n\u2020 From Dr. Scully\u2019s list it appears that this is the s\u0101ch, the rose-coloured starling, Pastor roseus. See also Vullers, Dictionary, s. v. The bird seen by Jahangir may have been a dipper, Lawrence, 153.\n\n\u2021 The MSS. have kulhai.\n\n\u00a7 According to the two I.O.

After the words \u201cdenied it,\u201d there comes in the MSS. the statement: \u201cThe \u1e24ak\u012bm-z\u0101da (\u1e24ak\u012bm\u2019s son) produced two witnesses in court. The Sayyids invalidated (or impeached) the testimony of one of them, and the \u1e24ak\u012bm-z\u0101da brought a third witness\nHakim's son, by way of caution,* would swear an oath on the Qur'an, and would take what was his due from them. I told them to do whatever was right by the Divine Law. The next day Mu'tamid Kh\u0101n represented that the Sayyids showed great humility and submissiveness. The matter was a complicated\u2020 one. The greater reflection shown in ascertaining the truth in the matter the better. I accordingly ordered that \u0100\u1e63af K. should take exceeding trouble and forethought in ascertaining the truth of this quarrel, and point out such a way (of unravelling it) that no doubt whatever should remain: With all this, if it could not be cleared up, I would examine them in my own presence. Immediately he heard these words, the Hakim's son lost both his hands and his heart in the affair, and made a number of his friends intercessors, and proposed a withdrawal. His representation was that if the Sayyids would not\u2021 refer the matter to \u0100\u1e63af K. he would give a release, and that hereafter he would have no right against nor claim from them. Whenever \u0100\u1e63af K. sent to fetch him; as he was a low deceiver, he passed his time in making excuses, and did not appear until he handed over the deed of release to one of his friends, and the true state of affairs became evident to \u0100\u1e63af K. They brought him by force into the place of examination, and, having no choice, he confessed that the deed had been prepared by one of his servants, who himself witnessed it, and had misled him. He gave a writing to this effect. When \u0100\u1e63af K. informed me of the real state of matters, I took away his mansab and jagir, and cast him out of my presence, and gave the Sayyids leave to return to Lahore in all honour and respect.\n\nand proved his case according to law.\u201d The Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, p. 161, has not the whole of this, and it has kh\u0101rij instead of j\u0101rih, but it has the words guw\u0101h-i-s\u0101li\u0161 (\u201ca third witness\u201d).\n\n* The meaning seems to be that he would in corroboration and ex cautela take the oath. He had already proved his claim in the ordinary way by witnesses and the production of the bond. See the account in the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 160-63, which is fuller than that in text.\n\n\u2020 Mu'tamala-i-kulli ast. \u201cThe case was involved\u201d (like a bud?), or perhaps \u201cthe case was important.\u201d\n\n\u2021 The text wrongly omits the negative. See Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, I. 62.\nOn Mub\u0101rak-shamba (Thursday), the 8th of Kh\u016brd\u0101d, I\u2019tiq\u0101d Kh\u0101n was promoted to the mansab of 4,000 personal and 1,500 horse, and \u0160\u0101diq Kh\u0101n to that of 2,500 personal and 1,400 horse. Zainu-l-\u2018\u0101bid\u012bn, son of the deceased \u0100saf Kh\u0101n (J\u0101far), was promoted to be Bakhshi of Akad\u012bs. R\u0101ja Bir Singh Deo Band\u012bla raised his head of honour with the high mansab of 5,000 personal and horse.\n\nIn Kashmir the most juicy(?) fruit is the ashkan (?) (askam\u012b in the MSS.). It is subacid (mai-kh\u016bsh), smaller than the \u0101l\u016b b\u0101l\u016b (sour cherry), much better flavoured, and more delicate. When drinking wine, one cannot eat more than three or four \u0101l\u016b b\u0101l\u016b, but of these one can take as many as a hundred in twenty-four hours, especially of the paivand\u012b (?) sort. I ordered that the ashkan should hereafter be called the kh\u016bshkan. It grows in the hills of Badakhshan and in Khurasan; the people there call it jamdam\u012b. The largest of them weigh \u00bd mi\u0161qal. The sh\u0101h-\u0101l\u016b (cherry), on the 4th Urdbihisht, appeared of the size of a grain of pulse; on the 27th it reddened, and on the 15th Kh\u016brd\u0101d it was ripe, and new fruit (nau-bar) had formed (?). The sh\u0101h-\u0101l\u016b (cherry), to my taste, is better than most fruits. Four trees had borne fruit in the N\u016br-afz\u0101 garden. I called one of these Sh\u012br\u012bn-b\u0101r, the second Kh\u016bsh-guw\u0101r, the third, which bore the most fruit, Pur-b\u0101r, and the fourth, which had less, Kam-b\u0101r. One tree in Khurr\u0101m\u2019s garden had also borne fruit, and I called it Sh\u0101hw\u0101r. There was a young plant in the little garden of \u2018Ishr\u0101t-afz\u0101 (joy enhancing), and this I called Nau-b\u0101r (new fruit). Every day I plucked with my own hand sufficient to give a flavour to my cups. Although they sent them by runners from Kabul as well, yet to pick them oneself from one\u2019s home garden gave additional sweetness. The sh\u0101h-\u0101l\u016b of Kashmir is not inferior to that of Kabul; it is even better grown. The largest of them weighed one t\u0101nk, five surkhs.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 21st, P\u0101dsh\u0101h* B\u0101n\u016b Begam died (became a sitter in the bridal chamber of the permanent world), and\n\n* Apparently this was \u0160\u0101liha-B\u0101n\u016b d. Q\u0101'im K. Blochmann, 371, and 477. n. 2. She had the name of P\u0101dsh\u0101h-mahall. See Hawkins\u2019 account in Purchas, IV. 31, and Kh\u0101fi K. I. 259. He calls the father Q\u0101sim.\ngrief for this heart-rending event laid a heavy load on my mind. I hope that Almighty God may give her a place near his own forgiveness. A strange thing is\u2014that Jotik R\u00e2y, the astrologer, two months before this, had informed some of my servants that one of the chief sitters in the harem of chastity would hasten to the hidden abode of non-existence. He had discovered this from the horoscope of my destiny, and it fell out accordingly.\n\nOne of the events (that now took place) was the martyrdom of Sayyid 'Izzat* K. and of Jal\u0101l K. Gakhar in the army of Bangash. The particulars of this are that when the season for the collection of revenue arrived, Mah\u0101bat K. appointed a force to go into the hill-country to eat up the crops of the Afghans, and not omit one tittle of raiding and plundering, and killing and binding. When the servants of the Court arrived at the foot of the Pass the ill-fated Afghans attacked them from all sides, and took the head of the Pass, and fortified it. Jal\u0101l K., who was an experienced man, and an old man that had undergone labours, thought it better to delay for a few days, so that the Afghans might expend the few days' provisions they had brought with them on their backs, and necessarily disperse of their own accord; that then his men would be able to cross with ease over the head of the difficult Pass. When he once passed the head of the defile they would be unable to do any more, and would be punished. 'Izzat K., who was a battle-lighting flame and a foe-burning lightning, did not fall in with Jal\u0101l K.'s idea, and excited the steed of courage of some of the Sayyids of B\u0101rha. The Afghans, swarming round on all sides, like ants and locusts, attacked him, and caught him in their midst. Though the battlefield was not fit for cavalry, yet wherever the forehead of his wrath shone, he consumed many with the fire of his sword. In the midst of the fighting they hamstringed his horse, but he fought on foot and as long as he had breath, and at last fell bravely. At the time when 'Izzat K. made his attack, Jal\u0101l K. Gakhar\u2020 and Mas'\u016bd, s. Ahm\u0101d Beg K., and Bizan\n\n* It is Ghairat K; in I.O. MS., 181.\n\u2020 For Jal\u0101l K., see Blochmann, 455 and 486. He was grandson of Sult\u0101n \u0100dam.\n(or Bizhan), s. N\u0101d \u2018Al\u012b Maid\u0101n\u012b, and other servants, lost restraint, and rushed on from all sides of the pass, and the rebels seized the tops of the hills, and fought with stones and arrows. The devoted young men, both of the servants of the Court and the retainers of Mah\u0101bat K., performed the duties of valour, and slaughtered many of the Afghans. In this contest Jal\u0101l K. and Mas\u2018\u016bd, with many other brave men, sacrificed their lives. Owing to the rashness of \u2018Izzat K. such a disaster as this befell the Imperial army.\n\nWhen Mah\u0101bat K. heard this fearful news, he sent a fresh body of men to assist, and strengthened the posts. Wherever they found a trace of those ill-fortuned ones, they did not fail to slay or bind them. When I heard this news, I summoned Akbar Qul\u012b, s. Jal\u0101l K., who had been told off for duty in the conquest of the fort of K\u0101ngra, to my presence, and gave him the mansab of 1,000 personal and 1,000 horse, and confirmed to him, according to custom, his hereditary territory (the Gakhar country) in jagir, presented him with a dress of honour and a horse, and sent him to the support of the army of Bangash. As \u2018Izzat K. had left a son of very tender years, keeping before my eyes, that discerned the truth, his life-sacrifice, I gave him (the child) a mansab and a jagir, so that those left behind should not be scattered abroad, and others might have increased hope.\n\nOn this day Shaikh Ahm\u0101d of Sirhind, who had for some time been placed in the prison of correction on account of his pretentiousness (literally, adorning his shop and selling himself) and immoderate language, was summoned to my presence, and I released him, giving him a dress of honour and Rs. 1,000 for expenses, and making him free to go or remain. He justly represented that his punishment had really been a valuable lesson to him, and that his desire was to wait on me.\n\nOn the 27th Kh\u016brd\u0101d apricots arrived* (from Kabul). The picture-gallery in the garden had been ordered to be repaired; it was now adorned with pictures by master hands. In the\n\n* Ras\u012bd. See lower down text 308, where it is noted that the cherries came to an end.\nmost honoured positions were the likenesses of Hum\u0101y\u016bn and of my father opposite to my own, and that of my brother Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s. After them were the likenesses of M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n, M\u012brz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24ak\u012bm, Sh\u0101h Mur\u0101d, and Sult\u0101n D\u0101niy\u0101l. On the second storey (row ?) were the likenesses of the Amirs and special servants. On walls of the outer hall the stages of the road to Kashmir were recorded in the order in which I had come to them. A poet fixed the date by this hemistich:\n\nPictures of kings of Solomon-like glory.*\n\nOn Thursday, the 4th of the Il\u0101h\u012b month of T\u012br, the Feast of b\u016briy\u0101-k\u016bb\u012b\u2020 took place. On this day the Kashmir cherries came to an end. From the four trees of the N\u016br-afz\u0101 garden, 1,500, and from other trees 500 had been plucked. I strictly ordered the officials of Kashmir to plant sh\u0101h-\u0101l\u016b (cherry) trees in all the gardens. On this day Bh\u012bm, s. R\u0101n\u0101 Amar Singh, was honoured with the title of Raja, and Dil\u012br K., brother of the brave \u2018Izzat K., was promoted to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 800 horse, Muhammad Sa\u2018id, s. A\u1e25mad Beg K., to that of 600 personal and 400 horse, and Mukhl\u012bs-ullah, his brother, to that of 500 personal and 250 horse. On Sayyid A\u1e25mad \u1e62adr the mansab of 1,000, and on M\u012brz\u0101 \u1e24usain, s. M\u012brz\u0101 Rustam \u1e62afaw\u012b, that of 1,000 personal and 500 horse, were bestowed, and the last-named was despatched for duty to the Deccan. On Sunday, the 14th of the Divine month of T\u012br, \u1e24asan \u2018Al\u012b Turkm\u0101n was made Governor of Orissa, and his personal and horse mansab was raised to 3,000. On this day Bah\u0101dur K., Governor of Qandahar, sent offerings of nine Iraq horses, some nine pieces of gold brocade, some brocaded satin, and some marten\u2021 skins, and other things; these were laid before me.\n\nOn Monday, the 15th, I rode to see the summer quarters\n\n* This represents A.H. 1029, or 1620.\n\u2020 Mat-treading or beating=house-warming. This was in honour of the new picture-gallery.\n\u2021 D\u0101nah\u0101-i-k\u012bsh. See Vullers, s.v. Kesh. The k\u012bsh is a marten of whose skin neckcloths, etc., are made. This note corrects the one at p. 321 of translation, as also the text there.\nof T\u016bs\u012b-marg* (?). Arriving in two marches at the foot of the kotal, on Wednesday, the 17th, I reached the top of the pass. For a distance of 2 koss very elevated ground was crossed with difficulty. From the top of the kotal to the Il\u0101q (summer quarters) was another koss of high and low land. Although here and there flowers of various colours had bloomed, yet I did not see so many as they had represented to me, and as I had expected. I heard that in this neighbourhood there was a very beautiful valley, and on Thursday, the 18th, I went to see it. Undoubtedly, whatever praise they might use in speaking of that flowery land would be permissible. As far as the eye reached flowers of all colours were blooming. There were picked fifty kinds of flowers in my presence. Probably there were others that I did not see. At the end of the day I turned my reins in order to return. That night an account was given in my presence of the siege of Ahmadnagar. Kh\u0101n-Jah\u0101n told a strange tale, which I had also heard before, and it is written on account of its strangeness. At the time when my brother D\u0101niy\u0101l was besieging the fort of Ahmadnagar, one day the garrison laid the gun Malik-maid\u0101n\u2020 (king of the plain) against the Prince\u2019s camp, and fired it. The ball reached nearly to the Prince\u2019s tent; from that place it bounded (ricocheted), and went to the lodging of Q\u0101z\u012b B\u0101yaz\u012bd, who was one of the Prince\u2019s companions, and fell there. They had tied up the Qazi\u2019s horse at a distance of 3 or 4 gaz. As the ball touched the ground, the horse\u2019s tongue\u2021 was torn out by the root and fell on the ground. The ball was of stone, weighing 10 maunds as current in Hindustan, or 80 Khurasan maunds. The said gun is so large that a man can sit comfortably in it.\n\nOn this day I promoted Abu-l-\u1e24asan, the chief Bakshi, to the mansab of 5,000 personal and 2,000 horse, Mub\u0101riz K. to that of 2,000 personal and 1,700 horse, B\u012bzan (or B\u012bzhan),\n\n* It is B\u016bs\u012b-marg in the I.O. MSS. But perhaps the text is right, and the place is the Tosh Maid\u0101n of Lawrence, 16.\n\u2020 The gun is now at Bijapur, I.G., VIII. 186.\n\u2021 Compare Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 163-64. The text has r\u0101n (\u201cthigh\u201d) instead of zab\u0101n.\ns. N\u0101d \u2018Al\u012b, to that of 1,000 personal and 500 horse; and Am\u0101nat K. to that of 2,000 personal and 400 horse. On Thursday, the 25th, I gave Naw\u0101zish K., s. Sa\u2018id K., the mansab of 3,000 personal and 2,000 horse, Himmat K. that of 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse, and Sayyid Ya\u2018q\u016bb K., s. Sayyid Kam\u0101l Bukh\u0101r\u012b, that of 800 personal and 500 horse. M\u012br \u2018Al\u012b \u2018Askar,* s. M\u012br \u2018Al\u012b Akbar M\u016bsaw\u012b, was dignified with the title of M\u016bsaw\u012b K. As I had repeatedly heard praise of the \u012al\u0101q of K\u016br\u012b-marg,\u2020 I felt much disposed to visit it at this time, and on Tuesday, the 7th Amurd\u0101d, rode in that direction. How shall I write its praise? As far as the eye could reach flowers of various hue were blooming, and in the midst of the flowers and verdure beautiful streams of water were flowing; one might say it was a page that the painter of destiny had drawn with the pencil of creation. The buds of hearts break into flower from beholding it. Undoubtedly there is no comparison between this and other \u012al\u0101qs, and it may be said to be the place most worth seeing in Kashmir.\n\nIn Hindustan (i.e., Upper India) there is a bird called Pap\u012bh\u0101,\u2021 of a sweet voice, which in the rainy season utters soul-piercing (j\u0101n-s\u016bz, lit. soul-burning) laments. As the koyal lays its egg in the nest of the crow, and the latter brings up its young, so I have seen in Kashmir that the pap\u012bh\u0101 lays its egg in the nest of the ghaugha\u2019\u012b \u00a7 (ring-dove ?) and the ghaugha\u2019\u012b brings up its young.\n\n* Blochmann, 382. The name of the son is given in the MSS. as M\u012br \u2018Al\u012b Asghar.\n\n\u2020 Perhaps this is the Gurais Valley of Lawrence, 16, for K\u016br\u012b may be read G\u016br\u012b.\n\n\u2021 See Jarrett, III. 121 and n. 5. The bird is either the common hawk-cuckoo of Jerdon (Hierococcyx varius) or his Coccystes melano-leucos\u2014i.e., the pied-crested cuckoo, for both birds seem to have the native name of Pap\u012bh\u0101. The Hierococcyx varius is the \u201cbrain-fever\u201d bird of the Anglo-Indian, I.G., I. 250. The pied-crested cuckoo occurs in Kashmir, and so also apparently does a bird of the genus Hierococcyx. Lawrence, pp. 138, 139.\n\n\u00a7 I am not sure what bird this is. Ghaugha\u2019\u012b means a turtle dove in Bengal, but I doubt if this be the bird meant by Jah\u0101ngir. Ghaugha\u2019\u012b would mean a noisy bird, and perhaps is the Bengal Babbler.\nOn Thursday, the 17th, Fid\u0101\u2019\u012b K. was promoted to the mansab of 1,500 personal and 700 horse. On this day the ambassador of \u2018Izzat* K., ruler of \u016arganj, by name Mu\u1e25ammad Z\u0101hid, came to the Court, and presented a petition, accompanied with some trifling presents, and recalled the existence of hereditary relations (lit., shook the chain of hereditary connection). I distinguished him with the eye of kindness, and on the spur of the moment gave the ambassador 10,000 darbs (Rs. 5,000) as a present, and ordered the officials of the buy\u016bt\u0101t (household) to prepare and send (by him) such things as he might ask for.\n\nAt this time a strange act of grace occurred to my son\u2020 Kh\u0101n-Jah\u0101n (Lod\u012b). He had become very ill from the madness of wine, and from the overpowering of this man-destroying intoxication things had come to such a pass that it threatened his precious life. Suddenly he reformed, and God directed him, and he made a vow that thereafter he would not defile the fringe of his lip with wine. Although I warned him that it was not good to give it up all at once, and that he should leave it off gradually, he would not consent, but gave it up manfully.\n\nOn the 25th of Amurd\u0101d Bah\u0101dur K., Governor of Qandahar, was promoted to the mansab of 5,000 personal and 4,000 horse, and on the 2nd of the Divine month of Shahr\u012bwar, M\u0101n Singh, s. R\u0101wat Shankar, to that of 1,500 and 800 horse, M\u012br \u1e24us\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn to that of 1,500 and 500 horse, and Karamu-llah, s. \u2018Al\u012b Mard\u0101n K.\u2021 to that of 600 with 300 horse.\n\nof Jerdon, or the S\u0101t Bh\u0101\u2019\u012b (seven brothers) of the Indians. It belongs to the Malacocircus genus, and Jerdon, I. 340, states that the pied-crested cuckoo generally lays her egg in the nest of the Malacocirici. The babbling thrushes occur in Kashmir. In Blochmann, 296, there is an account of how ghaugh\u0101\u2019is are caught.\n\n* MS. 305 has Ghairat K., but No. 181 has \u2018Arab K., and this agrees with Stanley Lane Poole\u2019s Muhammadan dynasties (p. 279), which has \u2019Arab Mu\u1e25ammad as ruling down to 1623. \u016arganj is in Kh\u012bva.\n\n\u2020 Jah\u0101ng\u012br called Kh\u0101n-Jah\u0101n his farzand (son).\n\n\u2021 Not the famous \u2018Al\u012b Mard\u0101n, but \u2018Al\u012b Mard\u0101n, who was killed in the Deccan. Blochmann, 496.\nAs at this time I was much inclined to parti-coloured* veined teeth, the great Amirs exerted themselves greatly in looking out for them. Of these, \u2018Abdu-l-\u2018Az\u012bz K. Naqshband\u012b sent a servant of the name of \u2018Abdu-llah with a letter to Khw\u0101ja \u1e24asan and Khw\u0101ja \u2018Abdu-r-Rah\u012bm, ss. Khw\u0101ja Kal\u0101n J\u016byb\u0101r\u012b, who are to-day the leading holy men of Transoxiana, containing a request for these things. By chance, Khw\u0101ja \u1e24asan had a perfect tooth, exceedingly delicate, and immediately sent it with the aforesaid (servant) to the Court, which it reached this day. I was greatly pleased, and ordered them to send the value of Rs. 30,000 in choice goods to the Khw\u0101jas, a service for which M\u012br Baraka Bukh\u0101r\u012b was fixed upon. On Thursday, the 12th Shahriwar, M\u012br Mir\u0101n obtained leave to take up the faujdarship of Mew\u0101t, and his mansab, original and increased, was fixed at 2,000 with 1,500 horse. I gave him a special horse, with a dress of honour and a sword.\n\nAt this time it was made clear from a report of Sundar\u2020 that Jauhar Mal, the rebel, had delivered his soul to the lords of hell (had died). It was also reported that a force sent against one of the Zamindars had abandoned the path of caution, and without fortifying the way of entrance and exit, or taking possession of the hill-tops, had entered into the fastnesses of the hills, and had fought without any good result. As the day drew towards its close, they had turned their reins with their object unaccomplished, and in turning back, had made every haste. Many people had been killed, especially those who would not put up with the disgrace of flight. They purchased martyrdom with their lives. Out of them Sh\u0101h-b\u0101z K. Dal\u016bm\u0101n\u012b\u2021 (?), which is a tribe of Lod\u012b\n\n* Dand\u0101n-i-ablaq-i-jauhar-d\u0101r. Jauhar-d\u0101r here does not mean \u201cjewelled,\u201d but veined or striped. See Vullers, I. 542a. Walrus-teeth may be meant by Jah\u0101ngir, but tortoise-shell is more likely.\n\n\u2020 Sundar is another name for R\u0101ja Bikram\u0101jit, and the reference must be to the Siege of K\u0101ng\u1e5ba. Jauhar Mal was a son of R\u0101ja B\u0101so, and appears to be the same person as Suraj Mal. It is Jauhar in I.O. MS., 181.\n\n\u2021 Deot\u0101n\u012b in No. 181. Blochmann has the name Dut\u0101n\u012b, apparently as a tribal name (p. 504), and Elphinstone speaks in vol. ii., p. 82, of a small tribe called Dumtauny.\nAfghans, sacrificed his life with a band of his servants and tribesmen. In truth he was a good servant, and had intelligence combined with modesty. Another report was that Jam\u0101l Afgh\u0101n, Rustam, his brother, Sayyid Na\u1e63\u012bb B\u0101rha, and some others had come in wounded. It was also reported that the siege (of K\u0101ngra) had become a close one, and the affair was going hard with the besieged. They had sent (literally thrown out) men as mediators, and had asked for quarter. It was hoped that by the blessing of increasing fortune the fort would be subdued.\n\nOn Wednesday, the 18th of the same month (Shahr\u012bwar), Dil\u0101war K. K\u0101kar died a natural death. Beyond all the other Amirs of high rank, he combined valour with leadership and knowledge of affairs, and from the time when I was a prince carried away from all the ball of superiority in my service. He acted constantly with the perfection of sincerity and the jewel of doing right, and had thus arrived at the dignity of Amirship. In the end of his life God Almighty bestowed grace upon him, and the conquest of Kishtw\u0101r, which was an exemplary service, was accomplished by his courage. It is hoped he may be one of the pardoned. His sons and the others that he left behind him I exalted with all kinds of favours and patronage, and enrolled those of his people who were fit for mansabs amongst the servants of the Court. I ordered the rest, to remain as usual with his sons, so that his company might not be split up.\n\nOn this day Q\u016br Yas\u0101wul came with a diamond that Ibr\u0101h\u012bm K. Fath-jang had obtained from the Bengal mine, and waited on me. Waz\u012br K., diwan of Bengal, who was an old servant of the Court, died a natural death.\n\nOn the night of Thursday, the 19th, the Kashmiris had lined with lamps both sides of the Bihat. It is an ancient custom that every year on this day everyone, whether rich or poor, whoever has a house on the bank of the river, should light lamps as on the Shab-i-bar\u0101t. I asked the brahmans the reason of this, and they said that on this day the fountain-head of the Jhelam was disclosed, and the custom had come down from old days that on this date must take place the\nfeast of *Veth tarw\u0101h.* Veth means the Jhelam, and they call thirteen *tarw\u0101h*; as this day is the 13th of *Shaww\u0101l*, they light lamps. In this way they call it the *Veth tarw\u0101h*. Undoubtedly the lamp-lighting was good. I sate in a boat and went round to see it. On this day the feast of my solar weighing took place, and according to the usual custom, I weighed myself against gold and other things, which I distributed among deserving people. The 51st year of the age of this suppliant at the throne of Allah came to an end; the 52nd year lit up the face of expectation. It is hoped that the period of my life will be spent in pleasing God. The entertainment of Thursday, the 26th, was held in the lodging of \u0100\u1e63af K. (N\u016br-Jah\u0101n\u2019s brother), and that pillar of the Sultanate fulfilled the duties of homage, and of offerings, and thereby acquired eternal bliss.\n\nOn 1 *Shahr\u012bwar* (about 11 August) ducks (*murgh\u0101b\u012b*) appeared on the Wular lake, and on the 24th of that month they appeared on the Dal lake. The following is the list of birds which are *not* met with in Kashmir:\n\n**List.**\n\n1. Crane\u2020 (*kulang*).\n2. S\u0101ras (*grus Antigone*).\n3. Peacock.\n\n* Veth is the Kashmiri name for the Jhelam (Lawrence, 18). It is contracted from Vitasta. It is curious that the date of the festival should be given according to a Muhammadan month (*Shaww\u0101l*), which must recur at different seasons. Apparently the meaning is that the birth of the Jhelam took place on that day.\n\nApparently the festival is not much celebrated nowadays, for it is not mentioned by Lawrence (264-266), except that in a note to p. 266 the Vathtrwah is mentioned as a day on which daughters receive presents. The 19th *Shahriwar*, the corresponding date mentioned by Jah\u0101ngir, would answer to the end of August or beginning of September, and to the Hindu month of \u0100sin. 13 *Shaww\u0101l*, 1029, would correspond to 1 September, 1620. Possibly the *Shaww\u0101l* of text is a mistake for the Hindu month S\u0101wan\u2014*i.e.*, Sr\u0101van. The legend of the birth of the Jhelam is told in Stein, 97. Possibly *Shaww\u0101l* does not here mean the month, and we should read *shagh\u0101l-i-chir\u0101gh\u0101n*, \u201cthe business of lamps.\u201d\n\n\u2020 The crane visits Kashmir in winter, but Jah\u0101ngir was never there in that season.\n4. Bustard (*jarz* or *charz*).\n5. Stork (*laglag*).\n6. Bustard (*tughdar\u012b*).\n7. Bustard (*tughd\u0101gh*).\n8. Karw\u0101nak (kind of crane ?).\n9. Zard-tilak (golden oriole ?).\n10. Nuqra-p\u0101y (silver-foot).\n11. \u2018Azam-p\u0101y.\n12. Boza laglag (royal curlew).\n13. Pelican (*haw\u0101sil*).\n14. Makisa (Ardea indica ?).\n15. Baghl\u0101 (paddy-bird).\n16. Goose (*g\u0101z*).\n17. Konkla (*kokil\u0101*, the black cuckoo ?).\n18. Partridge (*dur\u0101j*).\n19. Sh\u0101vak (starling).\n20. Nol-i-surkh (redbeak, [parrot] ?).\n21. M\u016bsicha (wood-pigeon ?).\n22. Hariyal (green pigeon ?).\n23. Dh\u012bng (adjutant).\n24. Koyal (Eudynamys Orientalis).\n25. Shakar-khw\u0101ra (sugar-eater, [parrot] ?).\n26. Mahokh\u0101 (cuculus castaneus ?).\n27. Mahirl\u0101t (?).\n28. Dhanesh (hornbill).\n29. Gulcha\u1e5b\u012b (quail ?).\n30. \u1e6cat\u012br\u012b, which the Turks call (blank in MSS.) and I have named *bad-\u0101w\u0101z*, \u201cevil-voiced.\u201d (It is perhaps the sandpiper.)\n\nAs the Persian names of some of these are not known, or rather, these birds don\u2019t exist in Persia (*Wil\u0101yat*), I have written the Hindi names.* The names of the carnivorous\n\n* The text wrongly gives this as a list of birds which are found in Kashmir. The Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma 159 and the MSS. show that the text has omitted a negative, and that the list consists of Indian birds which are not met with in Kashmir. Several of the names do not occur in the dictionaries. No 2 (the s\u0101ras) is described in Babur\u2019s Memoirs, 321. No. 4 is the florikan, or *Otis Bengalensis*. For Nos. 5-7 see Babur\u2019s Memoirs, 321. Karaw\u0101n is a crane in Arabic, apparently, and so Karw\u0101nak should be a little crane. It is also described as a kind of partridge. Perhaps the Karw\u0101nak is the demoiselle crane. No. 9 may be the oriole, or mango-bird, but that, too, is common in Kashmir. For No. 12, which may be the ibis, see Babur\u2019s Memoirs, 322. For No. 14 see Babur\u2019s Memoirs, p. 321, and for No. 18 Babur\u2019s Memoirs, 320. For the Sh\u0101rak (No. 19), see Babur\u2019s Memoirs, 319. No 22 may\nand herbivorous animals that are not in Kashmir are as follows: The tiger, the panther (y\u016bz), the rhinoceros,* the wild buffalo, the black antelope, the gazelle, the kot\u0101h p\u0101cha (hog-deer), the nil-g\u0101w, the wild ass, the hare, the lynx, the wild cat, the m\u016bshak-i-karbal\u0101\u02be\u012b (?),\u2020 the porpoise, and the porcupine.\n\nOn this day peaches came from Kabul by runners. The largest of these weighed 26 tolas,\u2021 or 65 mi\u1e63q\u0101ls. As long as their season lasted, such a number came that I gave them to most of the Amirs, and to the private servants fed from the royal table.\n\nOn Friday,\u00a7 the 27th, I went out to see V\u012brn\u0101g,|| the source of the Bihat. Going up the river 5 koss in a boat, I alighted at the village of P\u0101mp\u016br.\n\nOn this day unpleasant news came from Kishtw\u0101r. The details of this are that when Dil\u0101war K. conquered it and returned to Court, he left Na\u1e63ru-llah \u2018Arab, with some of the mansabdars to guard it. Na\u1e63ru-llah made two mistakes. One was that he treated the Zamindars and the people of the place harshly, and did not observe a conciliatory demeanour towards them. The second was that the forces sent as auxiliaries to him, in expectation of increase of mansab, asked him for leave to go to Court and transact their affairs. He yielded to their representations,\u00b6 and gave them leave one\n\npossibly be the bee-eater (*Merops viridis*). For No. 23 see Babur\u2019s Memoirs, 267 and 321. No. 25 may be one of the parrots, as H\u0101fi\u1e93 called the Indian parrots and poets *t\u016btiy\u0101n-i-shakar-shikan*. See \u0100yin-i-Akbari, Persian text, I. 415, and Jarrett, II. 150. The \u1e6dat\u012bn, No. 30, is apparently the black partridge *Francolinus vulgaris*. The names of the birds seem to be often wrong in the text, and so I have followed the I.O. MSS.\n\n* Kurg, but perhaps Gurg, \u201cthe wolf,\u201d is meant. The wolf is very rare in Kashmir (Lawrence, 109).\n\n\u2020 Query, m\u016bshak-i-k\u016br\u2014i.e., mole.\n\n\u2021 According to Wilson\u2019s Glossary, the tola is = 180 grains Troy, and the mi\u1e63q\u0101l = 63\u00bd grains Troy.\n\n\u00a7 Elliot, vi. 373, and Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma 165.\n\n|| Vernag of Lawrence, 23.\n\n\u00b6 Text u \u0101n; in MSS. \u016b.\nafter the other. When only a small force was left with him, the Zamindars, whose hearts had been wounded by him, and were on the look out for a disturbance, found their opportunity and made an attack from all quarters. Having burnt the bridge by which the army had crossed, and by which assistance could come, they lighted the fire of disturbance and sedition. Na\u1e63ru-llah shut himself up, and for two or three days defended himself with the greatest difficulty (literally, with a thousand life-extractions). As he had no provisions, and they had closed the road, he determined to accept martyrdom, and manfully, with some of those who were with him, performed the dues of bravery and valour until most of his men were killed, and some became captives in the hands of destiny.\n\nWhen this news reached my ear, I appointed Jal\u0101l, s. Dil\u0101war K., on whose forehead the traces of bravery and ambition were manifest, and who had done good service in the conquest of Kishtw\u0101r, with the mansab of 1,000 personal and 600 horse, giving him the attendants of his father who were enrolled among the servants of the Court, and an army of the soldiers of Kashmir, with many of the Zamindars and men on foot with muskets, to assist him in overcoming that mob, doomed to a vile end. An order was also given that R\u0101ja Sangr\u0101m, the Zamindar of Jammu, with his own men, should come in by the hill-road from Jammu. It is hoped that the rebels will quickly obtain the recompense for their deeds.\n\nOn Saturday, the 28th, I marched $4\\frac{1}{2}$ koss. Passing one koss beyond K\u0101k\u0101p\u016br, I came to the bank of the river. The *bang* (bhang) of K\u0101k\u0101p\u016br is well-known. It grows wild on the bank of the river in quantities. On Sunday, the 29th, I halted at the village of Panj Br\u0101ra.\u2020 This village\u2021 has been bestowed on my fortunate son Sh\u0101h Parw\u012bz. His Vakils had prepared a small building and a little garden overlooking the river. In the neighbourhood of Panj Br\u0101ra there is a\n\n* Lawrence, 67.\n\u2020 Jarrett, II. 356, where it is written Vej Br\u0101ra.\n\u2021 Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 164.\nmeadow (julga)* exceedingly clean and pleasant, with seven lofty plane-trees in the middle of it, and a stream of the river flowing round it. The Kashmiris call it Satha Bhuli (?)\u2020 It is one of the great resorts of Kashmir.\n\nOn this day arrived the news of the death of Kh\u0101n Daur\u0101n,\u2021 who died a natural death at Lahore. He had nearly reached ninety years of age. He was one of the brave men of the age and valiant in the battlefield. He combined bravery with leadership. He performed great services for the dynasty. It is hoped that he will be among the pardoned ones. He left four sons, but none of them was worthy to be his son. He left about Rs. 400,000 in cash and goods, which were given to his sons.\n\nOn Monday, the 30th, I first visited the fountain of Inch. This village had been given by my father to R\u0101m D\u0101s Kachhw\u0101ha,\u00a7 and he had erected buildings and basins at the spring. Undoubtedly, it is an exceedingly sweet and delightful place. Its water is perfectly clear and pure, and many fish swim in it.\n\nVerse.\n\nSo clear the water that the grains of sand at bottom\nCould be counted at midnight by a blind man.\n\nAs I gave || the village to my son Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n, he prepared an entertainment there, and presented offerings. I chose a trifle in order to please him. Half a koss from this spring, there is a fountain that they call Machh\u012b Bhawan,\u00b6 above which R\u0101y Bih\u0101r\u012b Chand, one of the servants of my father,\n\n* This must be the Nandimarg of Jarrett II. 357 and of Akbar-n\u0101ma III. 551. In the \u0100y\u012bn (Jarrett II. 356), mention is made of a place where there are seven fountains. Stein, 182, speaks of a spring sacred to the seven Rishis. Is it possible that chashma in the A.N. (Persian text, I. 565) is a mistake for chin\u0101r?\n\n\u2020 Satha ph\u016bl\u012b ? Seven fountains ?\n\n\u2021 Kh\u0101n Daur\u0101n is the Sh\u0101h-Beg K.

The beauty of this spring is more than one can describe, and large trees of ancient years, planes, white and black poplars, have grown up round it. I passed the night at this place, and on Tuesday, the 31st, pitched at the fountain of Achval.* The water of this spring is more plentiful than that of the other, and it has a fine waterfall. Around it lofty plane-trees and graceful white poplars, bringing their heads together, have made enchanting places to sit in. As far as one could see, in a beautiful garden, Ja'fari flowers had bloomed, so that one might say it was a piece of Paradise. On Wednesday, the 1st of Mihr, marching from Achval, I pitched camp near the fountain of Virnag.\u2020 On Thursday, the 2nd, the feast of cups was prepared at the spring. I gave my private attendants permission to sit down. Filling brimming cups, I gave them Kabul peaches as a relish, and in the evening they returned drunk (mast\u0101n, exhilarated ?) to their abodes. This spring is the source of the River Bihat, and is situated at the foot of a hill, the soil of which, from the abundance of trees and the extent of green and grass, is not seen. When I was a prince, I had given an order that they should erect a building at this spring suitable to the place. It was now completed. There was a reservoir of an octagonal shape, forty-two yards in area and fourteen\u2021 gaz in depth. Its water, from the reflection of the grass and plants on the hill, had assumed a hue of verdure. Many fish swam in it, round it halls with domes had been erected, and there was a garden in front of them. From the edge of the pond to the gate\u00a7 of the garden there was a canal 4 gaz in width and 180|| gaz in length, and 2 gaz in depth. Round the reservoir was a stone walk (khiy\u0101b\u0101n-i-sang).\n\n* The Achh Dal of Jarrett, II. 358, and the Achabal of Lawrence, 22.\n\u2020 Jarrett, II. 361.

See p. 92 of translation.\n\u2021 So in text, but a few lines lower down the depth is spoken of as four gaz. The Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma has \"fourteen yards.\"\n\u00a7 The Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma has \"to the end of the garden.\"\n|| Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 165, has \"186 yards.\"\nThe water of the reservoir was so clear that, notwithstanding its 4 gaz of depth, if a pea had fallen into it, it could have been seen. Of the trimness of the canal and the verdure of the grass that grew below the fountain, what can one write? Various* sorts of plants and sweet-smelling herbs grew there in profusion, and among them was seen a stem (b\u016b\u1e6d\u0101), which had exactly the appearance of the variegated tail of a peacock. It waved about in the ripple, and bore flowers here and there. In short, in the whole of Kashmir there is no sight of such beauty and enchanting character. It appears to me that what is upstream\u2020 in Kashmir bears no comparison with (i.e., is far superior to) what is downstream. One should stay some days in these regions, and go round them so as to enjoy oneself thoroughly. As the hour for marching was near, and snow was beginning to fall at the head of the passes, I had not the leisure to linger there, and was obliged to turn my rein towards the city. I gave an order that plane-trees should be planted on both sides, on the banks of the canal above mentioned. On Saturday, the 4th, I encamped at the spring of Loka Bhawan.\u00a7 This spring is also a pleasant spot. Although at present it is not equal to the others, if it were to be repaired it would be very good. I ordered them to construct a building worthy of the place, and to repair the reservoir in front of it. On the road I passed by a spring which they call Andha N\u0101g\u00a7 (blind fountain. See Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 166). It is well known that the fish in this fountain are blind. I delayed a while near this spring, and threw in a net and caught twelve of the fish. Of these, three were blind and nine had eyes. Evidently the water of this spring has the effect of making them blind. Certainly this is not devoid of strangeness. On Sunday, the 5th, I again passed by\n\n* Compare Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 166.\n\u2020 The meaning is that the Mar\u0101j (or Marr\u0101j), the upper part of Kashmir, is superior to the lower part, or K\u0101mr\u0101j.

It is five miles south of Achbal.\n\u00a7 Is this a corruption of \u0100nantan\u0101g\u2014i.e., Isl\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d?\nthe springs of Machh\u012b Bhawan and Inch, and went to the city.\n\nOn Wednesday, the 8th, news arrived of the death of H\u0101shim, s. Q\u0101sim K. On Thursday, the 9th, Ir\u0101dat K. was promoted to the governorship of Kashmir. M\u012br Jumla in his place was chosen for the duty of Kh\u0101ns\u0101m\u0101n, and Mu\u2018tamid* K. to that of \u2018Arz-muqarrir. The mansab of 2,000 personal and 500 horse was ordered for M\u012br Jumla. On the night of Saturday, the 11th, I entered the city. \u0100saf K. was appointed to the duty of Diwan of Gujarat. Sangr\u0101m, Raja of Jammu, was promoted to the mansab of 1,500 personal and 1,000 horse.\n\nOn this day I saw an unusual kind of fishing on the part of the fishermen of Kashmir. In a place where the water was up to a man\u2019s chest, they propelled two boats that were side by side, and so that at one end they were in contact, and at the other end they were 14 or 15 yards apart. Two boatmen held long poles in their hands, and sat on the outside edge of each boat (?) so as to regulate the space between each boat, and that they should proceed equally. Then ten or twelve boatmen got down into the water, and laying hold of the ends of the two boats that were joined\u2020 together with their hands, trampled the bottom with their feet, and moved on. The fish which were between the boats wanted to get out of the narrow space, and came against the feet of the boatmen. Immediately one of the boatmen dived, and another one pressed upon his back, and with his two hands kept him from coming to the surface. The latter caught a fish and produced it. Some who are skilful in the art catch two fish with their hands, and bring them to the surface. Among them was an old boatman, who generally at each dive brought up two fish. This kind of fishing occurs at Panj Br\u0101ra,\u2021 and is peculiar to the Jhelam. It is not used in\n\n* Author of Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 166. The appointment was that of examiner of petitions.\n\n\u2020 I presume that the ends laid hold of by the boatmen were the disengaged ends\u2014i.e., the ends 14 or 15 yards apart. But see Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 166-167.\n\n\u2021 Text Panj Haz\u0101ra. The MSS. are not clear. It may be the Sendbrary of Bernier.\nponds or in other streams. It also only takes place in the spring when the water is not cold or impetuous (gazanda, \"biting\"?).\n\nOn Monday, the 13th, the feast of the Dasahra took place. According to the annual custom, they decorated the horses in the special stables, and those that had been entrusted to Amirs, and brought them out. At this time I experienced in myself a shortness of breath and difficulty in breathing. I hope that in the end, please God, it may all go well.\n\nOn Wednesday, the 15th, I went to make an autumn tour in the direction of \u0160af\u0101p\u016br and the valley of L\u0101r, situated downstream of the Kashmir River. In \u0160af\u0101p\u016br there is a fine tank, and on the north side of it a hill full of trees. It being the beginning of autumn, it had a wonderful appearance, with trees of all colours, such as the planes, the apricot, and others, reflected in the middle of the tank, and very beautiful. Undoubtedly the beauties of autumn are not less than those of spring.\n\nVerse.\n\nThere's no exhilaration in decay, but to the eye\nThe glory of autumn is more brilliant than the Spring.\n\nAs the time was short and the hour of marching near, I took a short circuit and returned. These few days I passed pleasantly in catching* ducks. One day, in the midst of the sport, a boatman caught and brought me a young qarqara (the demoiselle crane, Ardea virgo). It was very thin and miserable. It did not live longer than one night. The qarqara does not live in Kashmir. This had become ill and thin at the time of coming from, or going to, Hindustan, and fallen there.\n\nOn Friday news came of the death of M\u012brz\u0101 Rahm\u0101nd\u0101d, s. the Kh\u0101n-kh\u0101n\u0101n. He died a natural death at B\u0101l\u0101p\u016br. It appears that he had been suffering from fever for some days. When he was recovering, the Deccanis one day appeared with an army. His elder brother, D\u0101r\u0101b K., mounted with the intention of fighting. When the news\n\n* The word is shik\u0101r, but, as he had renounced shooting, netting is probably what is meant.\nreached Rahm\u0101n-d\u0101d, with great bravery, notwithstanding his weakness and failing health, he went to his brother. After he had beaten the enemy, he returned and in taking off his jubba (quilted waistcoat) was not sufficiently careful. The wind immediately caught him, and he was seized with convulsions, and his tongue became powerless to speak. He remained two or three days in this state and died. He was a good and brave youth, was fond of sword-play, and was very zealous. In every place it was his idea to display his skill with the sword. Although fire burns equally what is green and what is dry, yet it appeared very grievous to me, and what must it have been to his broken-hearted old father? Hardly had the wound from the calamity of Sh\u0101h-naw\u0101z K. healed, when he received this fresh wound. I trust that God Almighty may give him patience and resignation.\n\nOn Thursday, the 16th, Khanjar K. was promoted to the mansab of 3,000 personal and horse, Q\u0101sim K. to that of 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse, and Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24usain, brother of Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n, who held the post of Bakhsh\u012b to the army of Kangra, that of 800 personal and horse. On the night* of Monday, the 27th of the Divine month of Mihr, after one watch and seven gharis had passed, the royal standards were raised auspiciously and happily to return towards Hindustan. As the saffron had blossomed, a march was made from the neighbourhood of the city to the village of P\u0101mp\u016br.\u2020 In the whole country of Kashmir there is saffron only in this place. On Thursday, the 30th, the feast of cups was held in a saffron field. Groves on groves, and plains on plains were in bloom. The breeze in that place scented one's brain. The stem is attached (close?) to the ground. The flower has four petals, and its colour is that of a violet. It is of the size of a champa flower, and from the middle of it three stigmas of saffron grow. They plant the bulbs, and in a good year obtain 400 maunds of the current\n\n* Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 169.\n\u2020 Or P\u0101mpar, the ancient Padmap\u016bra.

The custom is for half to go to the government, and half to the cultivators. A seer is bought and sold for Rs. 10. Occasionally its market price is more or less, and it is an established custom that they bring the saffron flowers plucked, and according to the plan they have adopted from of old, they take half its weight in salt as wages. There is no salt in Kashmir, and they bring it from Hindustan. Again, among the excellencies of Kashmir are the plumes of feathers (kalgi) and the hawks (j\u0101nwar-i-shik\u0101ri). As much as 10,700 feathers are yearly obtained. Hawks and falcons are taken in nets to the number of 260. It has also nest sparrow-hawks (b\u0101sha),\u2020 and the nest sparrow-hawk is not bad. On Friday, the 1st of the divine month of \u0100b\u0101n, marching from P\u0101mp\u016br, I pitched my camp at Kh\u0101np\u016br. As it was reported to me that Zamb\u012bl\u2021 Beg, ambassador from my brother Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s, had reached the neighbourhood of Lahore, a dress of honour and Rs. 30,000 for expenses were sent to him by M\u012br \u1e24us\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn s. \u2018Azudu-d-daula Inj\u016b.\u00a7 I ordered that whatever he might expend on entertaining the ambassador should be sent to him to the extent of Rs. 5,000.|| Before this I had directed that from Kashmir to the end of the hilly country buildings should be erected at each stage for the accommodation of myself and the ladies, for in the cold weather one should not be in tents. Although the buildings at this stage had been completed, as they were still damp and there was a smell of lime, we put up in tents. On Saturday, the 2nd, I halted at Kalamp\u016br. As it had repeatedly been represented to me that in the neighbourhood of H\u012br\u0101p\u016br there was a waterfall\u00b6 very high and wonderful, as it was 3 or 4 koss off on the left.\n\n* MSS. have 3,200.\n\u2020 I.e., hawks taken from the nest, and not born in captivity.\n\u2021 Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 169.\n\u00a7 This is M\u012br Jam\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn, the dictionary-maker and friend of Sir Thomas Roe.\n|| The sentence appears obscure, but probably it was an order to the authorities at Lahore to supply \u1e24us\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn with the cost of entertaining the ambassador up to the amount of Rs. 5,000.\n\u00b6 Perhaps the waterfall described by Bernier in his ninth letter, and mentioned as having been admired by Jah\u0101ng\u012br.\nof the road, I hastened there to see it. What can be written in its praise? The water pours down in three or four gradations (?). I had never seen such a beautiful waterfall. Without hesitation, it is a sight to be seen, very strange and wonderful. I passed the time there in enjoyment till the third watch of the day, and filled my eye and heart with the sight; but in the cloudy and rainy season it is not devoid of wildness. After the third watch had passed, in the evening I rode back to Hirap\u016br,* and passed the night at that stage. On Monday, the 4th, crossing over the kotal of B\u0101r\u012b Br\u0101r\u012b,\u2020 I chose Pirpanjal; at the head of the kotal, for a halting-place. Of the roughnesses of the pass and the difficulties of this road what shall I write? It is difficult for thought even to cross it. In these last few days snow had repeatedly fallen, the hills had become white, and in the middle of the path in some places ice had formed, so that the hoof of a horse had no hold, and a rider could only pass with difficulty. God Almighty bestowed upon us His mercy, for it did not snow on this day. The advantage was for those who went on in front. Those who followed came in for snow. On Tuesday, the 5th, going by the pass of Pirpanjal the camp was pitched at Posh\u0101na. Although on this side there is a descent, yet as it is high, most of the people passed it on foot. On Wednesday, the 6th, we pitched at Bahramgalla. Near this village there is a waterfall and a very fine spring. According to orders, they had made a terrace for me to sit upon; indeed, this is a sight to be seen. I ordered that they should engrave on a stone tablet the date of the crossing, and place it on the top of the terrace (suffa). B\u012b-badal K.\u2021 composed some couplets, and this mark of my fortune remains on the path of poetry as a memorial on the tablet of Time (?). There are two Zamindars on this road in whose charge are the arrange-\n\n* Hirap\u016br is H\u016brap\u016br and the ancient S\u016brap\u016bra.\n\u2020 Mar\u012b or N\u0101r\u012b Br\u0101ra in the MSS.\n\u2021 B\u012b-badal K. is the name given by Jah\u0101ngir to Sa\u2018\u012bd\u0101 or Shaid\u0101, who was chief goldsmith. See end of 15th year, p. 326 of text. For Shaid\u0101, who died in Kashmir in 1080 (A.D. 1669-70), see Rieu, III. 1083a, and I.251, and Supp. Catalogue, p. 207, and Sprenger\u2019s Catalogue 124.\nments for the traffic on it, and they are in reality the keys of the country of Kashmir. They call one Mahd\u012b N\u0101yak and the other \u1e24usain N\u0101yak. The charge of the road from H\u012br\u0101p\u016br to Bahramgalla is in their hands. Bahr\u0101m N\u0101yak, the father of Mahd\u012b N\u0101yak, during the Kashmiri government, was an important person. When the authority passed to the imperial servants, M\u012brz\u0101 Y\u016bsuf K., during his government, made Bahr\u0101m N\u0101yak a traveller to the country of non-existence. It is now equally in the possession and charge of the two.* Although outwardly they are on good terms, they really bear great enmity towards each other. On this day Shaikh Ibn Yamin, who was one of the old trusted servants, went to the neighbourhood of God\u2019s mercy (died).\u2020 On account of my great reliance on him, my opium and drinking water\u2021 were in his charge. On the night when we were encamped above the kotal of Pirpanjal, the tents and furniture had not arrived. He was rather infirm and the cold affected him, and he became cramped so that he could not speak. He remained alive for two days in this state and then died. I gave over the private opium to Khaw\u0101\u1e63\u1e63 K., and the \u0101b-d\u0101r-kh\u0101na (the water department) to M\u016bsaw\u012b K. On Thursday, the 7th, the village of Th\u0101na\u00a7 became the encamping place. Many monkeys (maim\u016bn) were seen in Bahramgalla, and from that stage a great difference was apparent in the climate, the language, the clothing, the animals, and whatever properly belongs to a warm country. The people here speak both Persian and Hindi. Evidently Hindi is their real language, and they have acquired Kashmiri on account of the proximity of Kashmir. Briefly, one enters India at this place. The women do not wear woollen clothing, and like Indian women, they wear nose-rings.\n\nOn Friday, the 8th, R\u0101jaur was the camping-ground.\n\n* Text calls them brothers, but the MSS. show that bir\u0101dar is a mistake for bar\u0101bar, \u201cequally.\u201d\n\u2020 The MSS. add: \u201cHe was a good youth (jaw\u0101n) and without guile.\u201d\n\u2021 \u0100b-i-hay\u0101t, \u201cwater of life,\u201d a name given by Akbar to his \u0101b-d\u0101r-kh\u0101na, or supply of drinking-water, etc. See Blochmann, 51.\n\u00a7 Text wrongly has Tha\u1e6d\u1e6da.\npeople of this country were in old times Hindus, and the landholders are called Rajas. Sult\u0101n Fir\u016bz made them Muhammadans, but they are still called Rajas. They still have the marks of the times of ignorance. One of these is that just as some Hindu women burn themselves along with their husbands (bodies), so these women (the R\u0101jaur women) are put into the grave along with their (dead) husbands. I heard that recently they put alive into the grave a girl of ten or twelve along with her (dead) husband, who was of the same age. Also, when a daughter is born to a man without means, they put her to death by strangulation.* They ally themselves with Hindus, and both give and take girls. Taking them is good, but giving them, God forbid! I gave an order that hereafter they should not do such things, and whoever was guilty of them, should be capitally punished. There is a river at R\u0101jaur. Its water during the rainy season becomes much poisoned. Many of the people there get a swelling (b\u016bghma) under the throat, and are yellow and weak. The rice of R\u0101jaur is much\u2020 better than the rice of Kashmir. There are self-grown and sweet-scented violets in this skirt of the hills.\n\nOn Sunday, the 10th, I encamped at Naushahra. At this place, by order of my father, they had built a stone fort, and there is constantly here, by way of a station (th\u0101na), a body of men from the governor of Kashmir. On Monday the camp was at Chauki Hatt\u012b. A chela named Mur\u0101d had exerted himself to complete the buildings at this place, and had done it well. In the middle of the royal abode there was a fine terrace, superior to those of other stages. I increased his mansab. On Tuesday, the 12th, I halted at Bh\u012bmbar. Passing this day out of kotal and hills, we entered the broad plains of Hindustan. The hunters had previously been dispatched to form qamurghas, so as to prepare jirgas (hunting rings) in Bh\u012bmbar and Girjh\u0101k\u2021 and Makh\u012by\u0101la. On Wednes-\n\n* Elliott, VI. 376.

On this day R\u0101ja S\u0101rang Deo, who was one of the intimate attendants, was promoted to the mansab of 800 personal and 400 horse. On Saturday, the 16th, I went towards Girjh\u0101k, and in five marches encamped on the bank of the Bihat. On Thursday, the 21st, I hunted in the hunting-ring of Girjh\u0101k. Less game than usual was taken, and I was not satisfied. On Monday, the 25th, I hunted with much enjoyment in the hunting-ring of Makhiy\u0101la,\u2020 thence in ten stages I encamped at the stage of the hunting-place of Jahangir\u0101b\u0101d. When I was prince, this was my hunting-place. Afterwards, I founded a village with my own name, and erecting a small building, placed it in charge of Sikandar Mu\u2018\u012bn, who was one of my best huntsmen. After I came to the throne I made a pargana of it, and bestowed it as a jagir on him. I gave an order that they should construct there a building as a royal residence, with a tank and a minaret\u2021 (man\u0101ra). After his death this pargana was given in jagir to Ir\u0101dat K., and the charge of the buildings was given to him. It has now been handsomely completed. Undoubtedly the tank was very broad.\u00a7 and in the middle there is a delightful building. Altogether the buildings here cost Rs. 1,50,000. Really it is a kingly hunting-place. On Thursday and Friday, having halted, I enjoyed myself with various kinds of sport. Q\u0101sim K., who was honoured with the charge of Lahore, had the good fortune to pay his respects to me, and presented 50 muhars.\n\nIn one march after this stage I encamped at the garden of M\u016bmin \u2018Ishq-b\u0101z,|| which is on the bank of the Lahore River\n\n---\n\n* Mountain-sheep. Apparently three rings were made.\n\u2020 The I.O.

It is certainly a rare garden. On Monday, the 9th of the Divine month of \u0100zar, corresponding with the 5th Muharram of A.H. 1030* (20 November, 1620), mounting an elephant of the name of Indra, I went towards the city, scattering coin as I proceeded. After three watches and two gharis of day had passed, at the selected auspicious hour, having entered the royal residence, I alighted happily and auspiciously at the building recently brought to completion and finished handsomely by the exertions of Ma\u2018m\u016br K. Without exaggeration, charming residences and soul-exciting sitting places had been erected in great beauty and delicacy, adorned and embellished with paintings by rare artists. Pleasant green gardens with all kinds of flowers and sweet-scented herbs deceived the sight.\n\nVerse.\u2020\n\nFrom head to foot, wherever I look,\nA glance plucks at the heart\u2019s skirt (saying),\n\u201cThis is the place\u201d (to stop at).\n\nAltogether, there had been expended on these buildings the sum of Rs. 700,000 or 23,000 current tumans of Persia.\u2021\n\nOn this day the joy-enhancing news of the conquest of the fort of Kangra rejoiced our mind. In thankfulness for this great boon and important victory, which was one of the renewed favours of the Bestower of Gifts, I bowed the head of humility at the throne of the merciful Creator, and beat with loud sounds the drum of gladness and pleasure. Kangra is an ancient fort to the North of Lahore, situated in the midst of the hill country, famous for its strength and the difficulty of conquering it. Who was the founder of this fort God only knows. The belief of the Zamindars of the province of the Panjab is that, during this period the said fort has never passed to any other tribe, and no stranger has stretched out to it the hand of dominion. Wisdom is from\n\n* Text wrongly has 1031.

But certainly from the time when the voice of Islam and the sound of the established religion of Mu\u1e25ammad reached Hindustan, not one of the Sultans of lofty dignity has obtained the victory over it. Sult\u0101n F\u012br\u016bz-sh\u0101h, with all his power and might, himself went to conquer it, and besieged it for a long time. As he knew that the strength of the fort was such that as long as the means for holding it and provisions were with the besieged, victory over them was unattainable, nolens volens he was contented with the coming of the Raja to pay his respects to him, and withheld his hand. They say that the Raja prepared an offering and an entertainment, and at his request took the Sultan inside the fort. The Sultan, after going round and inspecting it, said to the Raja that to bring a king like him inside the fort was not according to the dictates of caution. What could he do if the body of men who were in attendance were to attack him and take possession of the fort? The Raja made a sign to his men, and instantaneously an army of valiant men armed and accoutred, came out from a concealed place and saluted the Sultan. The Sultan became suspicious and anxious about an attack from these men, and suspected some stratagem. The Raja came forward and kissed the ground of service, and said: \u201cI have no thought but that of service and obedience, but as has been spoken by the auspicious tongue, I observe far-sighted caution, for all times are not the same.\u201d The Sultan applauded him. The Raja, having accompanied him for some stages, obtained leave to return. After this, whoever sat on the throne of Delhi sent an army to subdue K\u0101ng\u1e5ba, but the thing went no further. My revered father also sent a large army once under the leadership of Husain Quli K., who, after approved service, was honoured with the title of Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n. Whilst the siege was in progress, the outbreak of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm \u1e24usain M\u012brz\u0101 took place. That ingrate fled from Gujarat, and raised the flag of rebellion and calamity towards the Panjab. Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n was compelled to raise the siege, and to turn to extinguish the flame of his sedition. Thus the acquisition of the fort fell into the knot of delay. The thought was continually lurking in the\nroyal mind: \"The longed-for Fair one does not show her face from the secret place of Destiny.\" When by the Grace of the Glorious God the throne of the State was adorned by the existence of this suppliant, this was one of the holy wars which I considered incumbent on me. In the first instance I dispatched Murta\u1e93\u0101 K., who was governor of the Panjab, with a force of brave men skilled in war, to conquer the fort. This important matter had not been completed when Murta\u1e93\u0101 K. attained to the mercy of God (died). After this Jauhar Mal,* s. R\u0101ja B\u0101so, undertook this duty. I sent him, giving him the command of the army. That wicked one, taking to evil revolt and ingratitude, committed sin, and dispersion found its way into that army, and the acquisition of the fort fell into the knot of delay. No long time elapsed before that ingrate received the recompense of his deeds and went to hell, as has been described in its own place.\u2020\n\nIn fine, at this time Khurr\u0101m undertook that duty, and sent his own servant Sundar\u2021 with all haste, and many of the royal servants obtained leave to go to his support. On the 16th Shaww\u0101l, A.H. 1029, (5 September, 1620), the armies, having invested the fort, erected batteries. Looking to the ways of entrance into and exit from the fort with the eye of caution, they closed the road for the entrance of provisions. By degrees the besieged became straitened, and when there remained in the fort no grain that they could eat, for four months more they boiled dry grasses\u00a7 with salt and ate it. When destruction was imminent, and no hope of escape was left, they asked for quarter and surrendered the fort.\n\nOn Thursday, the 1st Mu\u1e25arram, A.H. 1030,|| Hijr\u012b (16 November, 1620), the victory unattainable by all preceding\n\n* Jauhar Mal is mentioned at p. 310.

The troops, who had displayed praiseworthy activity in this service, were exalted according to their exertions and fitness by increase of mansab and dignities.\n\nOn Thursday, the 11th, I went, at the request of Khurram, to his newly-built house. I took those of his offerings that pleased me. Three elephants were placed in the private stud. On the same day I appointed 'Abdu-l-'Aziz K. Naqshbandi to the faujdarship of the district of Kangra, and his mansab was fixed at 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse. I gave a private elephant to I'tiqad K. Alf K. Qiyam-khani K. obtained leave to take charge of the fort of Kangra, and his mansab, original and increased, was fixed at 1,500 personal and 1,000 horse. Shaikh Faizu-llah, son-in-law of Murtaza K., was appointed in company with him to stay at the top of the fort (bala-i-gil'a).\n\nOn the night of Saturday, the 13th of the same month, a lunar eclipse took place. Having performed the dues of humility at the throne of the highest and most powerful God, cash and goods were distributed by way of charity among the faqirs and poor, and deserving people. On this day Zambil Beg, ambassador of the ruler of Persia, had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. After performing salutation, he laid before me the gracious letter of that brother of high degree, containing expressions of sincerity and perfect friendship. He presented 12 Abbasi* (coin) as nazar, four horses with trappings, three tayyibun (white) falcons, five mules, five camels, nine bows, and nine scimitars. The Shah had given him leave, in company with Khan Alam, but for certain necessary matters he could not come with him. On this day he arrived at Court. I presented him with a superb dress of honour, with a plume and a jewelled turban fringe, and a jewelled dagger. Wisal Beg and Haji Ni'mat, who had come with\n\n* The Abbasi is also the name of a dress. The MSS. have fourteen, instead of four, horses.

Mah\u0101bat K., was promoted to the mansab, original and increased, of 2,000 and 1,500 horse. At the request of Mah\u0101bat K., I added 300 horse to the mansab of Mub\u0101riz K. Afgh\u0101n, and brought it up to 2,000 personal and 1,700 horse. One hundred horse were also added to the mansab of Kabak* (?). I sent winter dresses of honour to \u2018Abdu-llah K. and Lashkar K. At the request of Q\u0101sim K. I went to his garden in the neighbourhood of the city, and in the course of the procession, scattered 10,000 charans (4-anna pieces). Out of his offerings I selected one ruby and one diamond, and some cloths.\n\nOn the night of Sunday, the 21st, the advanced camp proceeded auspiciously and happily towards Agra. Barq-and\u0101z K. was appointed superintendent of artillery with the army of the Deccan. Shaikh Ish\u0101q (Isaac) was appointed to duty at Kangra. The brother of Allah-d\u0101d, the Afghan, I released from prison, and made him a present of Rs. 10,000. I gave also a t\u016bygh\u0101n falcon to Khurr\u0101m. On Thursday, the 26th, the usual entertainment took place. The presents from the ruler of Persia, which had been sent by Zamb\u012bl Beg, were laid before me. I gave an elephant to Sult\u0101n Husain, and made a present of Rs. 1,000 to Mull\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad Kashm\u012br\u012b.\u2020 The mansab of Sard\u0101r Afgh\u0101n, at the request of Mah\u0101bat K., was fixed at 1,000 personal and 400 horse.

It may, however, be Kang or Gang and a man\u2019s name.\n\n\u2020 Apparently the translator of the Rajatarangini.\n\n\u2021 Doubtless the Gwalior in the Panjab.\n\n\u00a7 Nur Jah\u0101n\u2019s daughter by Sh\u012br-afgan. The date of the asking is given in the text as the third, but should be the 30th, as in the I.O. MSS.\n(dowry given as part of the marriage rites). Most of the Amirs and the chief servants went to his house with gifts. He prepared a grand entertainment with much ceremony. It is hoped that it may be auspicious to him. As that Chief of the State had erected lofty buildings, and highly decorated bowers in his house, he invited me to an entertainment. I went there with the ladies. He had prepared a great feast, and laid before me appropriate offerings of all kinds. In order to please him, I took such as I approved of. On this day Rs. 50,000 were presented to Zambil Beg, the ambassador. The mansab of Zabar-dast K. was fixed at 1,000 personal and 500 horse, original and increased. Maq\u1e63\u016bd, brother of Q\u0101sim K., was promoted to the mansab of 500 personal and 300 horse, and M\u012brz\u0101 Dakhan\u012b, s. M\u012brz\u0101 Rustam, to that of 500 personal and 200 horse.\n\nAt this auspicious time* when the standards of victory and conquest were in Kashmir, the province of eternal spring, happily employed in sight-seeing and sport, representations constantly came from the officials in the Southern territories to the effect that when the victorious standards went to a distance from the centre of the Khalifate, the rulers of the Deccan, owing to their wickedness, broke their promises and raised their heads by giving trouble and exciting sedition, and placing their feet beyond their own boundary, took possession of many of the districts of Ahmadnagar and Berar. It was constantly reported that the chief object of these evil-fortuned ones was to plunder and ruin the cultivated fields and the grazing-lands. When at the first time the world-opening standards had proceeded to the conquest of the regions of the south and the overthrow of that band, and Khurram, with the vanguard, had gone to Burhanpur, they, by feline tricks suitable to such seditious people, made him their intercessor and evacuated the royal dominions. They also sent by way of tribute large sums in cash and goods, and promised that they would not let loose from their hands the rope of service, and would not place their feet beyond the boundary of respect, as has been recorded in the preceding\n\n* Elliot, VI. 376.\npages. At the request of Khurram, I had halted for a few days at the Fort of Sh\u0101d\u012b\u2019\u0101b\u0101d M\u0101nd\u016b, and at his intercession, and on their humiliation and bewailing, they were pardoned.\n\nAs they had now broken their agreement through evil disposition and quarrelsomeness, and had turned back from the way of obedience and service, I sent off the hosts of good fortune again under his leadership, that they might receive retribution for their evil deeds, and be an example to all those of crooked fortune and turned heads. But as the important business of K\u0101ng\u1e5ba had been entrusted to him, he had sent most of his experienced men there. For some days, accordingly, he could not arrange the matter. At last, report followed on report one after another, that the enemy had gathered strength, and that nearly 60,000 vagabond horsemen had collected together and taken possession of royal territory, and wherever there were posts, had removed them, and joined together in the town of Mahakar. For three months the imperialists had passed their days in strife and fighting with their rascally enemies, and during this time three pitched battles had taken place, and each time the self-sacrificing servants (of the State) had proved superior to the evil-fortuned rebels. As grain and provisions could not reach the camp by any road, and the enemy was plundering on all sides of the army of good fortune, a great scarcity of grain resulted, and the animals were in bad plight. Having no choice, they came down from the B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t, and took up their position at B\u0101l\u0101p\u016br. The rebels, waxing valiant in their pursuit, engaged in plundering in the neighbourhood of B\u0101l\u0101p\u016br. Of the servants of the Court 6,000 or 7,000 horsemen, well mounted, were selected, and they made an attack on the enemy\u2019s camp. They (the enemy) numbered about 60,000 cavalry. Briefly, a great fight took place, and their camp was plundered. Having killed and taken prisoners many of them, they returned in safety and with plunder. When they turned back those wretches again attacked them from all sides, and they came on, fighting as far as the camp. On both sides about 1,000 were killed. After this fight they (the imperialists)\nremained about four months at B\u0101l\u0101p\u016br. When the scarcity of grain became excessive, many of the qulaqch\u012bs (servants) ran away and joined the enemy, and constantly bands of them, taking to the road of disloyalty, were enrolled among the rebels. On this account, not considering it advisable to delay any longer, they (the imperialists) came to Burhanpur. Again, those wretches followed them and besieged Burhanpur, and they were six months shut up there. Many parganas of the provinces of Berar and Khandesh passed into their possession, and they stretched out the hand of oppression over the cultivators and poor, and engaged in collecting the revenues. As the army had undergone great hardships and the animals had fallen into bad condition, they could not leave the city to inflict substantial punishment. Thus the pride and conceit of those short-sighted ones became greater. Just at this time the royal standards returned to the capital, and by the grace of God K\u0101ngra was conquered.\n\nAccordingly, on Friday, the 4th of Dai, I despatched Khurr\u0101m in that direction, bestowing on him a dress of honour, a sword, and an elephant. N\u016br Jah\u0101n Begam also gave him an elephant. I told him after he had conquered the province of the Deccan he should take as a reward two* crores of dams from the conquered country. 650 mansabdars, 1,000 \u0100\u1e25ad\u012bs, 1,000 Turkish musketeers, and 1,000\u2020 gunners on foot, in addition to the 31,000 horse already in that quarter, and a large force of artillery, and many elephants, were appointed to accompany him. I also gave him a crore of rupees for the expenses of the victorious army. The servants (of the Court) who were appointed on this duty received each, according to his standing as a reward, horses, elephants, and dresses of honour.\n\nAt the same auspicious hour and favourable time, the standards of the expedition were turned toward Agra, and a halt was made at Naushahr.\u2021 Mu\u1e25ammad R\u012b\u1e93a J\u0101biri\n\n* The Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 176, has \u201cten crores.\u201d\n\u2020 The MSS. have 5,000. The word for \u201cgunners\u201d is t\u016bpch\u012b.\n\u2021 The MSS., instead of Naushahr, have saw\u0101d-i-shahr, \u201cthe environs of the city\u201d (cf. Lahore ?).\nwas appointed Diwan to Bengal, and Khw\u0101ja Mulk\u012b to the post of Bakhshi in the same, and were promoted in mansab. Jagat Singh, s. R\u0101n\u0101 Karan, came from his native place, and had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. On the 6th of the same month the open space on the bank of R\u0101ja Todar Mal\u2019s tank* became the alighting place of the Court of good fortune. Here I halted for four days. On this day some of the mansabdars who had obtained leave to go to the conquest of the Deccan were promoted as follows: Z\u0101hid K. held the mansab of 1,000 and 400 horse; he received that of 1,000 and 500 horse; Hard\u012b N\u0101r\u0101yan H\u0101\u1e0d\u0101 I promoted to 900 and 600 horse, original and increased; Ya\u02bfq\u016bb, s. Kh\u0101n Daur\u0101n, was given that of 800 and 400 horse, and in the same manner a great number of the servants of the State received increase of mansab according to their capabilities. Mu\u02bftamid K. was appointed to the post of Bakhshi and newswriter to the royal army, and was honoured with a t\u016bgh. The offering of Lachm\u012b Chand, Raja of Kumaon, consisting of hawks and falcons and other hunting animals, was brought before me. Jagat Singh, s. R\u0101n\u0101 Karan, obtained leave to proceed as an auxiliary to the army of the Deccan, being presented with a private horse and saddle. R\u0101ja R\u016bp Chand, having been honoured with the gift of an elephant and a horse, took leave to go to his jagir. On the 12th my son Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n (Lod\u012b) was made governor of Multan, and was given leave. There were conferred on him a complete dress together with a n\u0101d\u012br\u012b (a robe of Jahangir\u2019s invention), a jewelled dagger, a special elephant with trappings, a female elephant, a special horse of the name of Khadang (i.e., Arrow), and a pair of hawks. Sayyid Hizabr K. held the mansab of 1,000 and 400 horse. Increasing these by 500 and 200 horse, I gave him leave to accompany Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n. Mu\u1e25ammad Shafi\u02bf was appointed Bakhshi and newswriter to the Subah of Multan. Bhaw\u0101l (or Bahw\u0101l), who was one of the old servants, was made Ashraf-i-t\u016bp-kh\u0101na (head of the artillery ?), and received the title of R\u0101y. On the 13th the bank of the river Gobindw\u0101l became the camp of the army of prosperity,\n\n* It was in the vicinity of Lahore. Akbar-n\u0101ma, III. 569.\nand a halt of four days was made. A special elephant called Jai Singh, with a female, were given to Mah\u0101bat K., and sent to him by \u1e62afiyy\u0101 his servant. Robes of honour were also forwarded to the Amirs of the Subah of Bangash by \u2018\u012as\u0101 Beg.\n\nOn the 17th* the feast of my lunar weighing took place. As Mu\u2018tamid K. had been appointed Bakhshi to the army of the Deccan and given leave, the post of \u2018Ar\u1e93-muqarrir was given to Khw\u0101ja Q\u0101sim. M\u012br Sharaf was made Bakhshi of the A\u1e25ad\u012bs, and F\u0101\u017cil Beg made Bakhshi of the Panjab. As Bah\u0101dur K., governor of Qandahar, in consequence of a disease in his eyes, had requested to be allowed to kiss the threshold, entrusting the government of Qandahar this day to \u2018Abdu-l-\u2018Az\u012bz K., an order was issued to Bah\u0101dur K., that when he arrived he should hand over the fort to him and come himself to Court. On the 21st of the same month I took up my quarters at N\u016br-sar\u0101y.\u2020 At this spot the Vakils of N\u016br Jah\u0101n Begam had built a lofty house, and made a royal garden. It was now completed. On this account the Begam, having begged for an entertainment, prepared a grand feast, and by way of offering, with great pains produced all kinds of delicate and rare things. In order to please her, I took what I approved. I halted two days at this place. It was settled that the officials of the Panjab should send Rs. 200,000, in addition to the Rs. 60,000 already ordered for provisions for the fort of Qandahar. M\u012br Qiw\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn, the diwan of the Panjab, obtained leave to go to Lahore, and received a dress of honour. Q\u0101sim K., with a view to punish the\n\n* But the next page of text records another feast of the lunar weighment. Can it be that the lunar weighment refers to N\u016br Jah\u0101n\u2019s birthday, not to Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s? The 17th here mentioned is the 17th of the solar month of Dai, and corresponded to about December 28, 1620. In the following page (324) we are told that the lunar weighment took place on 30 Bahman, corresponding to 25 Rabi\u2018-u-l-awwal\u2014i.e., February 8, 1621. Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s birthday was on Rabi\u2018-u-l-awwal 17, so the anniversary fell this year on 22 Bahman. Consequently, if he celebrated it, as stated on p. 323, on 17 Dai, he did so more than a month too soon! Evidently there is a mistake somewhere.\n\n\u2020 This place is mentioned again in the account of the 16th year, p. 338. It evidently received its name from N\u016br Jah\u0101n.\nseditious in the neighbourhood of K\u0101\u1e45gra, and to preserve order in those regions, was given leave to go, and I presented him with a special n\u0101dir\u012b, a horse, a dagger, and an elephant. His mansab, original and increased, was fixed at 2,000 personal and 500 horse. At his request, I allowed R\u0101ja Sangr\u0101m (of Jammu) to proceed to that region, conferring on him a robe of honour, a horse, and an elephant.\n\nOn Thursday the camp was pitched outside the town of Sihrind. I halted one day, and amused myself with going round the garden. On Sunday, the 4th, Ab\u016b-l-\u1e24asan was sent on service for the conquest of the Deccan. A dress of honour, with a n\u0101dir\u012b, a special shawl, an elephant named \u1e62ub\u1e25-dam (breath of morn), a horsetail banner, and drums, being given him. I gave leave to Mu\u2018tamid K., presenting him with a dress of honour, and a special horse called \u1e62ub\u1e25-i-s\u0101diq (the true dawn). On the 7th of the same month the bank of the river Sarasati (Saraswati) was the place of encampment of good fortune in the neighbourhood of the qa\u1e63ba of mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101\u2018ab\u0101d. The next day I encamped at Akbar-p\u016br,* whence I sat in a boat on the river Jumna, to reach my object. On this day \u2018Izzat K. Ch\u0101ch\u012b,\u2020 with the faujdar of that region, had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. Giving Mu\u1e25ammad Shafi\u2018 leave to proceed to Multan, I presented him with a horse, a dress of honour, and a n\u016br-shahi m\u016bhar, and sent by him a special turban (ch\u012bra) to Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n, my son (farzand).\n\nThence, in five marches, I reached the pargana of Kir\u0101na, the native country of Muqarrab K., and the Court encamped there. By way of offering, his Vakils laid before me 91 rubies\u2021 and 4 diamonds, 1,000 gaz of mikhmal (satin) as a p\u0101-and\u0101z (foot-carpet), with a petition from him, presenting also 100 camels as charity. I ordered them to be distributed among deserving people. From this place, in five marches Delhi\n\n* Akbarp\u016br, twelve miles N.W. Mathur\u0101. J.

MS. 181, the word is Kh\u0101fi\u2014i.e., from Kh\u0101f or Khw\u0101f.\n\u2021 Ninety-one rubies is surely a mistake. The Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 177, only speaks of one. It is, however, 91 y\u0101q\u016bt in I.O. MS., 181.\nbecame the halting-place of the standards of good fortune. I sent It'im\u0101du-d-daula, to my fortunate son Sh\u0101h Parwiz with a special farj\u012b (a dress), for him, and it was settled that he should return in the space of one month and wait on me. Having halted for two days at Salimgarh, on Thursday, the 23rd, I passed through the district of Delhi with the intention of hunting in the pargana of P\u0101lam, and halted on the bank of the Shams\u012b tank. On the road I scattered 4,000 charans (Rs. 1,000) with my own hand. Twenty-two elephants, male and female, had arrived from Bengal as an offering from Allah-y\u0101r, s. Iftikh\u0101r K., and were passed before me.\n\nZ\u016b-l-Qarnain* obtained leave to proceed to the faujdarship of Sambhar. He is the son of Iskandar, the Armenian, and his father had the good fortune to be in the service of \u2018Arsh-\u0101shy\u0101n\u012b (Akbar), who gave him in marriage the daughter of \u2018Abdu-l-Hayy,\u2020 the Armenian, who was in service in the royal harem. By her he had two sons. One was Z\u016b-l-Qarnain, who was intelligent and fond of work, and to him, during my reign, the chief diwans had entrusted the charge of the government salt works at Sambhar, a duty which he performed efficiently. He was now appointed to the faudjarship of that region. He is an accomplished composer of Hindi songs. His method in this art was correct, and his compositions were frequently brought to my notice and were approved. La'l Beg\u2021 was selected for the darogha\u1e25ship of the records in the place of N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn Quli. I passed four days pleasantly in sporting in the neighbourhood of P\u0101lam and returned to Salimgarh. On the 29th, 19 elephants,\n\n* This is the Armenian of whom so much is said by Father Botelho and other missionaries. It is mentioned in M. W\u0101ris's continuation of the P\u0101dish\u0101h-n\u0101ma, p. 392, of B.M. MS., that Z\u016b-l-Qarnain Farang\u012b came from Bengal and presented poems which he had composed on Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n's name, and got a present of Rs. 4,000. He it was, probably, who entertained Coryat. The passage in the text seems to show that Akbar had an Armenian wife.\n\n\u2020 He is mentioned in some MSS. of the Akbar-n\u0101ma, vol. iii., as taking part in the religious discussions.\n\n\u2021 Probably this is the La'l Beg who wrote a book about the Naqsh-band\u012b order. See Ma'\u0101\u0161iru-l-Umar\u0101, II., 382.\n2 eunuchs,* 1 slave, 41\u2020 fighting cocks, 12 bullocks, and 7 buffaloes were brought before me as offerings from Ibr\u0101h\u012bm K. Fath-jang. On Thursday, the 30th, corresponding with the 25th Rabi\u2018u-l-awwal, the ceremony of my lunar weighing\u2021 was performed. I had sent Koka K. to the Kh\u0101n-kh\u0101n\u0101n, and forwarded some messages by him. On this day a petition from him arrived. M\u012br Mir\u0101n, who had been appointed to the faujd\u0101rship of Mew\u0101t, on this day came and paid his respects, and was dignified with the governorship of Delhi, in the room of Sayyid Bahwa.\n\nOn this day \u0100q\u0101 Beg and Mu\u1e25ibb \u2018Al\u012b, the envoys of the rule of Persia, paid their respects, and presented a loving letter from that noble brother, together with a black and white plume (kalg\u012b-i-ablaq), valued by the jewellers at Rs. 50,000. My brother also sent me a ruby weighing 12 t\u0101nks,\u00a7 which had belonged to the jewel-chamber of M. Ulugh Beg, the successor of M. Sh\u0101h-rukh. In the course of time, and by the revolutions of fate, it had come into the hands of the \u1e62afaw\u012b family. On this ruby there were engraved in the Naskh\u2225 character the words: \u201cUlugh Beg b. M. Sh\u0101h-rukh Bah\u0101dur b.

After some days, when the news of the conquest of the Deccan arrived, I gave that ruby to Khurr\u0101m, and sent it to him.\n\nOn Saturday, the 1st of Isfand\u0101rm\u016bz, I marched from Salimgarh, and going first to the glorious mausoleum of Hum\u0101y\u016bn (may the lights of Allah be his testimony!), performed the dues of humility, and presented 2,000 quarter rupees (charan) to those who sat in seclusion in that pure cemetery. I encamped twice on the bank of the Jumna in the environs of the city. Sayyid Hizabr K.,* who had been appointed an auxiliary to Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n, was sent off with the distinction of a dress of honour, a sword, a dagger, a horse, and a standard. Sayyids \u2018\u0100lim and \u2018Abdu-l-H\u0101d\u012b, his brothers, were also each honoured with a horse and a dress of honour. M\u012br Baraka Bukh\u0101r\u012b was allowed to go to Transoxiana. I entrusted Rs. 10,000 to him, 5,000 of them to be conveyed to Khw\u0101ja \u0160\u0101li\u1e25 Dihbidi, who from his fathers was one of the well-wishers of this State, and the other 5,000 to be divided among the muj\u0101wirs (custodians) attached to the tomb of T\u012bm\u016br (may the lights of Allah be his testimony!). I also gave a special turban (ch\u012bra) to Mah\u0101bat K., and sent it to him by M\u012br Baraka. I also ordered M\u012br Baraka to make every effort to procure mottled fish-teeth, and to procure them from any possible quarter, and at any price.\n\nI went by boat from Delhi, and in six stages reached the plain of Brind\u0101ban. I gave an elephant to M\u012br Mir\u0101n, and permitted him to go to Delhi. Zabar-dast K. was selected to be M\u012br T\u016bzuk (master of ceremonies) in the place of Fid\u0101\u02bei K., and I presented him with a special shawl (parm-narm). Next day, Gokul\u2020 was the place of encampment. At this stage, Lashkar K., the governor of Agra, \u2018Abdu-l-Wahh\u0101b D\u012bw\u0101n, R\u0101ja Nath Mal, Khizr K.

On the 11th I halted auspiciously at the N\u016br-afsh\u0101n\u2020 garden, which is on the opposite side of the Jumna. As the auspicious hour for entering the city had been fixed for the 14th, I halted here, and at the selected auspicious hour proceeded to the fort, and entered the palace happily and victoriously. The propitious journey from Lahore to Agra was accomplished in the period of two months and two\u2021 days, with 49 marches and 21 halts. No day either of marching or halting, on land or water, passed without sport. 114 deer, 51 duck, 4 heron (k\u0101rw\u0101nak), 10 black partridge (durraj), and 200 bodna\u00a7 were taken on the way.\n\nAs Lashkar K. had satisfactorily performed his duties at Agra, I increased his mansab by 1,000 personal and 500 horse, and made it 4,000 personal and 2,500 horse, and sent him as an auxiliary to the army of the Deccan. Sa\u02bfid\u0101, superintendent of the goldsmith\u2019s department, was dignified with the title of B\u012b-badal K. Four horses, some silver ornaments and cloths, which the ruler of Persia had sent me by \u0100q\u0101 Beg and Mu\u1e25ammad Mu\u1e25ibb \u2018Al\u012b, were produced before me on this day. The entertainment of Thursday, the 20th, took place in the N\u016br-m\u0101nzil garden. I gave a present of Rs. 1,00,000 to my son Shahriy\u0101r. Muzaffar K., according to order, came from Thatta, and had the good fortune to wait on me. He offered 100 muhars and Rs. 100. Lashkar K. produced a ruby as an offering. It was valued at Rs. 4,000. A special horse of the name of Mu\u1e63\u0101\u1e25ib (companion) was given to \u2018Abdu-llah K. \u2018Abdu-s-Sal\u0101m, s. Mu\u02bfazzam K., having arrived from Orissa, had the good fortune to wait on me: 100 muhars and Rs. 100 were laid before me as his nazar. The mansab of D\u016bst Beg, s. T\u016blak K., was fixed at\n\n* They had made an istiqb\u0101l, or visit of welcome, from Agra.\n\u2020 This was Babar\u2019s garden.

The entertainment of Thursday, the 27th, was held in the N\u016br-afsh\u0101n garden. A special dress of honour was given to M. Rustam, and a horse to his son, who was called Dakh\u0101n\u012b, and a special horse and an elephant to Lashkar K.\n\nOn Friday, the 28th, I went to hunt to the village of Samonagar, and returned at night. Seven Persian horses, with their trappings, were laid before me as an offering from \u0100q\u0101 Beg and Mu\u1e25ibb \u2018Al\u012b. I presented Zamb\u012bl Beg, the ambassador, with a N\u016br-jah\u0101n\u012b muhar of the weight of 100 tolas, and gave a jewelled penholder to \u0160\u0101diq K., the chief Bakhshi. I also gave a village* in Agra, by way of in\u2018\u0101m, to Khizr K. F\u0101r\u016bq\u012b. In this year 85,000 bigh\u0101s of land, 3,325 khar-w\u0101rs (of rice), 4 villages, 2 ploughs (of land), and a garden, Rs. 2,327, 1 muhar, 6,200 darbs (half rupees), 7,880 quarter rupees (charan), 1,512 tolas of gold and silver, and 10,000 dams from the treasury were given, in my presence, as alms to faqirs and necessitous people. Thirty-eight elephants, of the value of Rs. 2,41,000,\u2020 were presented as offerings, and were placed in the special elephant house, whilst 51 were presented by me to the great Amirs and the servants of the Court.\n\n* The word \u201cvillage\u201d is omitted in both the I.O. MSS.\n\u2020 This gives an average of Rs. 6,342 for each animal.\nTHE SIXTEENTH\nNEW YEAR'S FEAST AFTER THE\nAUSPICIOUS ACCESSION\n\nOn Monday,* the 27th Rab\u012b\u2018u-l-\u0101khir, A.H. 1030 (10 March, 1621), the sun that bestows bounty on the world lit up the abode of fortune of Aries with his world-illuminating light, and gladdened the world and its inhabitants. The sixteenth year of the reign of this suppliant at the throne of Allah commenced with gladness and victory, and at the auspicious hour and blessed time I sat on the throne of success in the capital of Agra. On this joy-enhancing day my fortunate son Shahriy\u0101r lifted up his head with the honour of the mansab of 8,000 and 4,000 horse. My revered father bestowed, for the first time, this mansab\u2020 on my brothers. It is hoped that in the shadow of my education and in carrying out my pleasure, he may reach the extreme of life and prosperity. On this day B\u0101qir K. arrayed his men and passed them before me in order. The great Bakhshis recorded (the number as) 1,000 horse and 2,000 foot, and reported to me. Having promoted him to the mansab of 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse, I entrusted the duties of faujdar of Agra to him.\n\nOn Wednesday, together with the ladies seated in a boat, I went to the N\u016br-afsh\u0101n garden, and rested there at night. As the garden belongs to the establishment of N\u016br Jah\u0101n B., on Thursday, the 4th, she held the royal\u2021 entertainment and\n\n* The I.O.

Of jewels, jewelled ornaments, and all sorts of precious goods, I selected what I approved of, of the value of Rs. 100,000. During these days, every day after midday I embarked in a boat, and went to Samonagar, 4 koss distant from the city, for sport, returning to the palace at night. Sending R\u0101ja S\u0101rang Deo to my prosperous son Sh\u0101h Parwiz, I sent with him a special dress of honour, with a jewelled belt, which contained a sapphire* and several rubies. As I had given Behar to that son in the place of Muqarrab K., I started off a saz\u0101wul to conduct him from Allahabad to Behar. M\u012br Z\u0101hid,\u2020 son-in-law of Mu\u1e93affar K., having come from Thatta, waited on me. As M\u012br \u2018Azudu-d-daula\u2021 had become very old and decrepit, he could not carry out the duties of the camp and his jagir. I released him from the trouble of service and active work. I ordered that he should receive Rs. 4,000 every month out of the public treasury, and living at ease and in comfort at Agra or Lahore, or wherever he wished, should employ himself in prayers for my increased life and welfare.\n\nOn the 9th Farward\u012bn the offering of I\u2019tib\u0101r K. was laid before me. Of jewels, cloths, etc., the value of Rs. 70,000, was accepted, and I returned the remainder to him. Mu\u1e25ibb \u2018Al\u012b and \u0100q\u0101 Beg, envoys of the ruler of Persia, presented twenty-four horses, two mules, three camels, seven greyhounds (sag-i-t\u0101z\u012b), twenty-seven pieces (t\u0101q) of brocade, a sham\u0101ma\u00a7 of ambergris, two pairs of carpets, and two namad takya|| (woollen coverlets). Two mares with foals that my brother had sent with them were also brought before me.\n\nOn Thursday, at the request of \u0100\u1e63af K., I went to his house with the ladies. Having prepared a grand entertainment, he submitted to me many delicate gems and wonders in cloths, and rare gifts. Choosing out of these to the value of Rs. 130,000, I gave the rest to him. Mukarram K., governor\n\n* Y\u0101q\u016bt-i-kab\u016bd, \u201ca blue ruby.\u201d\n\u2020 The I.O.

At this time I saw a wild ass * (g\u016br-khar), exceedingly strange in appearance, exactly like a lion. From the tip of the nose to the end of the tail, and from the point of the ear to the top of the hoof, black markings, large or small, suitable to their position, were seen on it. Round the eyes there was an exceedingly fine black line. One might say the painter of fate, with a strange brush, had left it on the page of the world. As it was strange, some people imagined that it had been coloured. After minute inquiry into the truth, it became known that the Lord of the world was the Creator thereof. As it was a rarity, it was included among the royal gifts sent to my brother Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s. Bah\u0101dur K. Uzbeg had sent as an offering some tipch\u0101q horses and cloth stuffs from \u2018Ir\u0101q, and they were produced before me. Dresses of honour for the winter were sent for Ibr\u0101h\u012bm K. Fath-jang and the Amirs of Bengal by M\u00fcmin Sh\u012br\u0101z\u012b. On the 15th the offering of S\u0101diq K. was produced. It was of all sorts. Having taken what was worth Rs. 15,000, I gave the remainder to him. F\u0101zil K. on this day also gave an offering according to his condition. Of this a trifle was taken. On Thursday (19th Farward\u012bn) the feast of the culmination was held, and when two watches and one ghari of the day had passed, I took my seat on the throne. According to the request of Mad\u0101r-ul-mulk I\u2018tim\u0101du-d-daula, the feast of the culmination was held in his house. He presented a remarkable offering of rare and choice things from all countries. Altogether I took the value of Rs. 138,000. On this day I gave Zambil Beg, the ambassador, a muhar\u2020 equal to 200 tolas in weight. At this time Ibr\u0101h\u012bm K. had sent some eunuchs from Bengal. One of these was a hermaphrodite. Among the offerings of the above-mentioned were two boats\n\n* Apparently a zebra. See Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 179, where it is stated that it was brought by sea. The text of the T\u016bzuk is wrong, as usual. What we should read is: \u201cIt was like a tiger (MS. 181 and Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma have sh\u012br, not babar), but the markings on a tiger are black and yellow, and these were black and white.\u201d\n\n\u2020 Perhaps this is the muhar now in Germany.\nmade in Bengal, of a very pleasant shape, on the decoration of which a sum of Rs. 10,000 had been expended. They were really kingly boats. Having made Shaikh Q\u0101sim K. governor of Allahabad, I honoured him with the title of Mu\u1e25tashim K. and the mansab of 5,000, and gave an order that the Diwans should give him an increase to his jagir out of the unappropriated (ma\u1e25all-i-ghair-i-\u2018amal\u012b) estates. R\u0101ja Shy\u0101m Singh, Zamindar of Sr\u012bnagar (in Garhw\u0101l) was given a horse and an elephant.\n\nAt this time it was reported to me that Y\u016bsuf K., s. \u1e24usain K.,* had died in the victorious army of the Deccan a sudden death. The report said that when he was at his jagir he had become so fat that he got out of breath with the least exertion. One day when he was paying his respects to Khurram, in coming and going his breathing\u2020 became difficult. When a dress of honour was given him, in putting it on and saluting he became helpless, and a trembling affected all his limbs, and with a hundred labours and exertions he saluted and stumbled out and fell under the shelter of the tent enclosure, and became unconscious. His servants placed him in a palanquin, and took him home, and as he arrived, the messenger of death came also. He received his command, and left his heavy lump of earth in the perishable dustbin. On 1st Urdibihisht, I gave a special dagger to Zambil Beg, the ambassador. On the 4th of the same month the feast of the k\u0101r-i-khair (consummation of marriage) of my son Shahriy\u0101r increased the joy of my heart. The \u1e24inna-band\u012b (putting on henna) assembly took place in the palace of Maryamu-z-zam\u0101n\u012b. The feast of the nik\u0101h (marriage) was held in the house of I\u2019tim\u0101du-d-daula. I myself went there with the ladies and adorned the feast of joy. After seven gharis of night had passed, on Friday\u2021 the marriage took place with rejoicings. I hope that it will be propitious to this daily-increasing State. On Tuesday, the 19th, in the N\u016br-afsh\u0101n garden, I presented my son Shahriy\u0101r with a jewelled ch\u0101rqab (coat), with a turban and waist-belt (kamar-band),\n\n* \u1e24usain K. Tukr\u012bya. \u2020 Nafs m\u012b-s\u016bzad. \u2021 Thursday night or Friday eve is what is meant.\nand two horses, one an \u2018Ir\u0101q\u012b, with a gold saddle, and the other a Turk\u012b, with an embroidered saddle.\n\nIn these days Sh\u0101h Shuj\u0101\u2018 had an eruption so violent that water would not go down his throat, and his life was despaired of. As it had been recorded in his father\u2019s horoscope that his son would die this year, all the astrologers were unanimous that he would not live, but Jotik R\u0101y said, on the contrary, that the dust of calamity would not settle on the skirt of his life. I asked: \u201cBy what proof?\u201d He said that in the horoscope of my destiny it was recorded that in this year no distress or trouble would find its way to the royal mind from any road, and as I had a great affection for the child, it behoved that no calamity should happen to him, and some other child would die. It came to pass as he said, and he carried his life out of this deadly place, and a son that he (Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n) had by the daughter of Sh\u0101h-naw\u0101z K., died at Burhanpur. Besides this, many of Jotik R\u0101y\u2019s judgments (a\u1e25k\u0101m) turned out correct. This is not without strangeness, and it is therefore recorded in these memoirs. I accordingly ordered him (Jotik R\u0101y) to be weighed against money and the weight came to Rs. 6,500. This was given him as a reward.\n\nMu\u1e25ammad \u1e24usain J\u0101bir\u012b was appointed Bakhshi and newswriter of the Subah of Orissa. The mansab of L\u0101ch\u012bn Munajjim (astrologer) Q\u0101qsh\u0101l, at the request of Mah\u0101bat K., was fixed, original and increased, at 1,000 personal and 500 horse. Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24usain, brother of Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n, came from Kangra and waited on me. Having presented an elephant to Bah\u0101dur K. Uzbeg, I sent it with his Vakil. Hurmuz and H\u016bshang, grandsons of the asylum of pardon Mirz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad Hak\u012bm, by reason of the caution that is fitting to rulers, had been imprisoned in the fort of Gwalior. At this time, having summoned them into my presence, I ordered them to remain in Agra, and a daily allowance sufficient for their expenses was allowed for them. At this time a brahman of the name of R\u016bdar Bhattach\u0101raj, who was one of the learned ones of this caste, and was engaged at Benares in teaching, had the good fortune to pay his\nrespects to me. In truth; he has studied well, both in the rational and traditional sciences, and is perfect in his own line.\n\nOne of the strange events of this time* was that on 30 Farwardin (about 10 April, 1621) in the present year, in a certain village of the pargana of Jalandhar, in the morning, a terrible noise arose from the East, such that its inhabitants, from fright at that terror-increasing sound, nearly deserted their bodies. Whilst this noise and disturbance were going on, a light fell from above on the ground, and the people thought that fire was raining down from heaven. After a moment, when that noise ceased, and their troubled hearts recovered from their bewilderment and terror, they sent a quick runner to the collector ('\u0101mil) Muhammad Sa'id, and informed him of what had occurred. He immediately rode there himself, and went to look at the spot. For ten or twelve yards in length and breadth the land was so burnt that no trace of any grass or green was left, and there were still signs of heat and burning. He ordered them to dig up the soil, and the more they dug the greater the heat appeared to be till they came to a place where a piece of heated iron appeared. It was as hot as if it had been taken out of a furnace. After a while it became cold, and taking it up, he conveyed it to his house, and placing it in a khar\u012b\u1e6da (cover), which he sealed, he sent it to Court. I ordered them to weigh it in my presence, and it came to 160 tolas. I ordered Master (Ust\u0101d) D\u0101'\u016bd\u2020 to make a sword, a dagger, and a knife of it, and bring them to me. He represented that it would not stand below the hammer, and fell to pieces. I told him in that case to mix it with other iron and make use of it. As I had told him, he mixed three parts of lightning-iron and one of other iron, and having made two swords, one dagger, and one knife, brought them to me. From the mixing of other iron he had brought out its quality (watering). According to the manner of the excellent swords of Yaman\u2021 and the South, it could be bent, and became straight again. I ordered them to test\n\n* Elliot, VI. 378.\n\u2020 King David was said to be a maker of cuirasses.\n\u2021 Yam\u0101n\u012b. Elliot has alm\u0101s\u012b (adamant-like).\nit in my presence. It cut very well, equal to true swords. I called one the Shamsh\u012br-i-q\u0101\u1e6d\u012b\u2018 (keen sword) and the other Barq-sirisht (lightning-natured). B\u012b-badal K. composed a quatrain which demonstrated* these particulars, and recited it:\n\nBy Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101ng\u012br the world acquired order.\nThere fell in his reign raw iron from lightning.\nFrom that iron were made by his world-taking command,\nA dagger, a knife, and two scimitars.\n\nAnd \u201cSpark of royal lightning\u201d gave the date (A.H. 1030).\n\nAt this time R\u0101ja S\u0101rang Deo, who had gone to my fortunate son Sh\u0101h Parwiz, came and waited on me. Parwiz represented that he, according to order, had proceeded from Allahabad to Behar. I hope he will be prosperous (there). Q\u0101sim K. was dignified with the gift of drums. On this day one \u2018Al\u012bmu-d-d\u012bn, a servant of Khurram, brought a report from him containing the good news of the victory, with a jewelled thumbstall (shast, perhaps a ring), which he had sent as n\u0101z\u0101r. I gave him leave, sending by him a dress of honour. Am\u012br Beg, brother of F\u0101\u017cil Beg. K., was appointed Diwan to my son Shahriy\u0101r and Mu\u1e25ammad Husain, brother of Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n, was made Bakhshi, and Ma\u2019\u1e63\u016bm was appointed Mir-S\u0101m\u0101n. Sayyid H\u0101j\u012b obtained leave to go as an auxiliary to the army of the Deccan, and I gave him a horse. Mu\u1e93affar K., was also promoted to the post of Bakhshi.\n\nAs at this time the mother\u2020 of Im\u0101m-qul\u012b K., the ruler of T\u016br\u0101n, had sent to N\u016br Jah\u0101n Begam a letter containing expressions of good will and the dues of acquaintanceship, and sent some rarities from that country, Khw\u0101ja Na\u1e63\u012br, who was one of the old servants and one of my attendants from the time when I was a prince, was sent by way of embassy on the part of N\u016br Jah\u0101n Begam with a letter, with choice gifts from this country. At the time when the ladies were\n\n* See Blochmann\u2019s translation and remarks in Proceedings A.S.B. for 1869, p. 167.

The details are as follows: When the victorious army reached Ujain, a band of the servants of the Court, who were in the fort of M\u0101nd\u016b, sent a report that an army of the rebels, putting forward the foot of audacity, had crossed the Narbad\u0101, and burning several villages that were under\u2020 the fort, were busy with rapine and plunder. Mad\u0101ru-l-mah\u0101mm Khw\u0101ja Ab\u016b-l-\u1e24asan, with 5,000 cavalry, were appointed to go in all haste and inflict punishment on that vain lot of people. The Khw\u0101ja made a night march, and at the dawn of day reached the bank of the Narbad\u0101. When the enemy learnt this, they in one moment threw themselves into the river and reached the bank of safety. The brave cavalry galloped after them, and pursued them for nearly 4 koss,\u2021 and with the sword of vengeance, made many of them travellers on the road of non-existence. The ill-fated rebels did not turn back the reins of haste till they reached Burhanpur. Khurr\u0101m wrote to Ab\u016b-l-\u1e24asan to remain on that (the South) side of the river till he came. Soon he, with his army, joined this advanced force, and hastened on, march by march, till he reached Burhanpur. The graceless rebels were still keeping\u00a7 their ground, and were encamped round the city.\n\n* Elliot, VI. 379.\n\u2020 Elliot, VI. 379, has \u201cin sight of the fort.\u201d Perhaps the meaning is that the villages were in the jurisdiction of the fort.\n\u2021 The Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 181, has \u201cfourteen.\u201d\n\u00a7 The account of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u2019s spirited attack on the Deccanis is in some places rather obscurely worded, and the printed edition is not always correct. Help can be obtained from the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 181, etc., and from Elliot, VI. 379. The text has fir\u0101r, \u201cflight,\u201d and this has been followed by Elliot, who has \u201con their approach the rebels took to flight, and removed to a distance from Burhanpur.\u201d But the true reading, as shown by the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, is qar\u0101r, \u201cfirmness,\u201d not fir\u0101r, and the words are bar daur-i-shahr, \u201cround the city,\u201d not bar d\u016br, \u201cfar\nAs the imperial servants had been contending with the rebels for two years, they had suffered much hardship from want of land (b\u012b-j\u0101g\u012br\u012b,* non-possession of fiefs, landlessness) and scarcity of corn, and their horses were worn out by continued service. Accordingly, they had to delay nine days in order to recruit. During this period, thirty lakhs of rupees and many cuirasses\u2020 were distributed among the soldiers, and saz\u0101wuls had been sent out and had brought many men out of the city (Burhanpur). The gallant troops had not yet put their hands to the work, when the black-fated rebels felt that they could not resist, and scattered like \u201cthe daughters of the Bier\u201d (the stars of the constellation of the Great Bear, which are dispersed over the heavens, instead of being clustered like the Pleiades). The brave and swift cavaliers followed them, and with the sword of vengeance cast many of them upon the earth of perdition. They gave them no rest, but smiting and slaying them, pursued them as far as Khirk\u012b, which was the residence of the Niz\u0101mu-l-mulk and the other rebels. One day before this the ill-starred one (Malik \u2018Ambar) had got information of the approach of the imperialists, and had removed the Niz\u0101mu-l-mulk and his family and effects to the fort of Daulatabad. There he had encamped, with his back resting on the fort, while in front of him there were marshes and quagmires.\u00a7 Most of his men became scattered in all directions. The leaders of the victorious army, with their vengeance-seeking soldiers, halted three days in the town of Khirk\u012b, and so destroyed a city\n\n* In the I.O.

It is jubba in I.O. No. 181.\n\n\u2021 Text, chihta u khamcha. The last word should, I think, be jamjama. Chiht\u0101 in Hindustani means a \u201cslimy place.\u201d It is jamjama in I.O.

In fine, after throwing down its buildings, all agreed in opinion that as an army of rebels was still besieging Ahmadnagar, they must at once go there, and inflict condign punishment on the originators of the disturbance, renew the supplies (of the Ahmadnagar garrison), and leave assistance there, and then return. With this view they set out, and came as far as the town of Patan (in Berar, Jarrett II. 233). Meanwhile, the crafty 'Ambar* sent agents and officers, and said: \"After this I will not drop the thread of service and loyalty from my hand, nor put out my foot beyond orders, and will regard whatever tribute and fine be commanded as a favour, and will send it to the government.\" It happened that just then there was great scarcity in the camp in consequence of the dearness of provisions, and also that news came that the rebel force which was besieging Ahmadnagar had withdrawn on hearing of the approach of the imperialists. Accordingly, a force was sent to help Khanjar K. (the governor of Fort Ahmadnagar), and a sum of money for his charges. Thereupon the imperialists were relieved from all anxiety and returned (across the Narbad\u0101?). After much entreaty and lamentation (on the part of 'Ambar) it was settled that in addition to the territory which of old had belonged to the empire, the rebels should surrender 14 koss of the adjoining country, and should pay into the public treasury fifty lakhs of rupees as tribute.\n\nI gave Af\u1e93al K. (Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n's diwan) leave to return, and sent with him, for Khurr\u0101m, the ruby plume (kalg\u012b-i-la\u1e6d\u012b) which the King of Persia had sent to me, and which has been already described, and I gave to the aforesaid (Af\u1e93al) a dress of honour, an elephant, an inkpot, and a jewelled pen. Khanjar K., who, when besieged in the Fort of Ahmadnagar, had performed approved services, and shown proper activity, was promoted to the mansab of 4,000 personal and 1,000 horse.\n\nMukarram K., having come by order from Orissa, had,\n\n* Text has ghair instead of 'Ambar.\nwith his brothers, the good fortune to wait upon me. He presented a string of pearls by way of offering. Mu\u1e93affaru-l-mulk, s. Bah\u0101duru-l-mulk, was honoured with the title of Nu\u1e63rat K. A standard was conferred on \u016ad\u0101 R\u0101m, Dakh\u0101n\u012b, and to \u2018Az\u012bzu-llah, s. Y\u016bsuf K., was given the mansab of 1,000 personal and 500 horse. On Thursday, the 21st, Muqarrab K. arrived from Behar, and had the good fortune to wait upon me. At this time \u0100q\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b, Mu\u1e25ibb \u2018Al\u012b Beg, H\u0101ji Beg, and F\u0101zil Beg, the envoys of the ruler of Persia, who had come at different times, were allowed to depart. To \u0100q\u0101 Beg I made a present of a dress of honour, a jewelled dagger, and Rs. 40,000 in cash; to Mu\u1e25ibb \u2018Al\u012b Beg a dress of honour and Rs. 30,000; and to the others in the same way I presented gifts according to their positions. I also sent a suitable souvenir by them to my brother. On this day Mukarram K. was appointed Subahdar of Delhi, and faujdar of Mewat. Shaj\u0101\u2018at K. \u2018Arab was dignified with the mansab of 3,000 personal and 2,500 horse, original and increased; Sharza K. with that of 2,000 and 1,000 horse; Girdhar, s. R\u0101y S\u0101l Kachhw\u0101ha, with that of 1,200 and 900 horse.\n\nOn the 29th, Q\u0101sim Beg, an envoy of the ruler of Persia, came and waited on me, bringing a letter from that brother of lofty dignity, containing expressions of sincerity and friendship. What he had sent by way of royal gifts was laid before me. On the 1st of T\u012br, I sent a special elephant called Gaj Ratan, for my son (farzand) Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n. Na\u1e93ar Beg, a servant of Khurr\u0101m, laid before me a letter from him asking for the gift of horses. I ordered R\u0101ja Kishan D\u0101s, the mushrif (accountant) to prepare within fifteen days 1,000 horses from the royal stables, and to send them off with him. I sent to Khurr\u0101m as a present a horse of the name of R\u016bm-ratan* (\"the jewel of Turkey\"), which the ruler of Persia had sent me out of the spoils of the Turkish camp.\n\nOn this day a servant of Ir\u0101dat K., of the name of Gh\u012by\u0101\u1e63u-d-d\u012bn, laid before me a report from him containing the good news of his victory. In the preceding pages there has been\n\n* Text wrongly has R\u016bp-ratan.\nwritten with the pen of demonstration an account of the rebellion of the Zamindars of Kishtw\u0101r and of the despatch of Jal\u0101l, s. Dil\u0101war K. As this important matter had not been properly managed by him, an order was given to Ir\u0101dat K. to hasten to take up that duty, and to inflict severe punishment on the rebels, and make such arrangements in the hill-country that the dust of dispersion and calamity might not settle on its frontiers. He, as ordered, hastened there and did approved service, and the people of sedition and disturbance, having turned their heads towards the desert of exile, escaped half dead. Thus once more was the thorn of calamity and mischief rooted out of that country, and having established the officials and established posts, he returned to Kashmir. As a reward for this service I added 500 horse to his mansab.\n\nAs Khw\u0101ja Ab\u016b-l-Hasan had done good service and shown proper activity in the affair of the Deccan, I increased his mansab by 1,000 horse. Ahmad Beg, nephew of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm K. Fath-jang, being exalted to the Subahdarship of Orissa, was dignified with the title of Kh\u0101n, and had given him a standard and drums. His mansab also was raised to 2,000 with 500 horse.\n\nAs I had often heard of the virtues and good qualities of Q\u0101z\u012b Na\u1e63\u012br of Burhanpur, my truth-seeking mind had a desire for his society. At this time he came, according to summons, to the Court. Doing honour to his learning, I paid him great regard. The Q\u0101z\u012b is one of the unique of the age for rational and traditional sciences, and there are few books that he has not read, but his exterior did not agree with his interior, and I could not be delighted with his company. As I found him much devoted to being a dervish and seclusion, I respected his feelings, and did not give him the trouble of serving me. I gave him Rs. 5,000, and dismissed him to his native country to pass his days in ease.\n\nOn the 1st of the Divine month of Amurd\u0101d B\u0101qir K. was promoted to the mansab of 2,000 personal and 1,200 horse, and of the Amirs and royal servants who had distinguished themselves in the conquest of the Deccan, thirty-\ntwo individuals were exalted by having their mansabs raised. 'Abdu-l-'Az\u012bz K. Naqshband\u012b, who had been appointed to the governorship of Qandahar at the request of my son Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n, was promoted to that of 3,000 personal and 2,000 horse. On the 1st Shahr\u012bw\u0101r I gave the ambassador Zambil Beg a jewelled sword, and also presented him with a village under the jurisdiction of the capital, the revenue of which was Rs. 16,000.\n\nAt this time, knowing that he was unfit for duty on account of his bad temper and want of knowledge, I dismissed \u1e24akim Rukn\u0101,* and told him he might go wherever he wished. As it was reported to me that H\u016bshang, the brother's son of Kh\u0101n '\u0100lam, had committed an unjust murder, having summoned him to my presence, I investigated the charge, and after it was established, gave an order for his execution. God forbid that in such affairs I should consider princes, and far less that I should consider Amirs. I hope that the grace of God may support me in this. On 1st Shahr\u012bwar, at the request of \u0100\u1e63af K., I went to his house and bathed in the bath-house that he has lately built. It is beautifully finished. After I had done bathing he laid before me offerings fit for a n\u0101zar. I took what I approved of and gave him the rest. The Wa\u1e63\u012bfa (pension) of Khizr Kh\u0101n (late ruler) of Khandesh, was fixed at Rs. 30,000,\u2020 original and increased.\n\nAt this time it was reported to me that a blacksmith of the name of Kaly\u0101n was much in love with a woman of his own caste, and was always laying his head at her feet, and showing symptoms of infatuation. The woman, though she was a widow, would in no way consent to accept him, and the love of this wretch who had given his heart to her made no impression on her. Having summoned both of them into my presence, I cross-examined them, and however much I advised her to unite herself to him, she did not agree. At this time the blacksmith said that if he could make sure that I would\u2021 give her to him, he would throw himself down from\n\n* P\u0101dish\u0101h-n\u0101ma, I., Part II., p. 349.\n\u2020 The text wrongly has 1,000.\n\u2021 The Bib.

I said by way of jest: \"Never mind the Sh\u0101h-burj; if your love be genuine, fling yourself from the roof of this house, and I'll make her submit herself to you.\" I had not ended before he ran like lightning and threw himself down. When he fell, blood began to flow from his eyes and mouth. I repented myself greatly of that jest, and was grieved in my mind, and bade \u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n take him to his house and look after him. As the cup of his life was brimming over, he died from the injury.\n\nVerse.\n\nThe life-sacrificing lover who stood on that threshold\nGave up his life with joy and regarded death as a trifle.\n\nAt the request of Mah\u0101bat K. the mansab of L\u0101chin Q\u0101qsh\u0101l, original and increased, was fixed at 1,000 personal and 500 horse.\n\nIt has been mentioned* that on the day of the Dasahara festival in Kashmir, I had perceived in myself a catching and shortness of breath. Briefly, from excessive rain and the dampness of the air, a difficulty in drawing breath showed itself on my left side near the heart. This by degrees increased and became intensified. Of the physicians who were in waiting on me, \u1e24ak\u012bm R\u016b\u1e25u-llah first tried his remedies, and for some time warm, soothing medicines were of use, for there was evidently a slight diminution (of the symptoms). When I came down from the hills, they came on again violently. This time for some days I took goats' milk, and again camel's milk, but I found no profit whatever from them. About this time \u1e24ak\u012bm Rukn\u0101, who had been excused from the journey to Kashmir, and whom I had left at Agra, joined me, and confidently and with a show of power, undertook my cure, and relied on warm and dry medicines. From his remedies, too, I derived no advantage; on the contrary, they appeared to increase the heat and dryness of my brain and temperament, and I became very weak. The disease increased and the pain was prolonged. At such a time and in this state, at which a heart of stone would have burnt\n\n* Elliot, VI. 380.\nbeen distressed) about me, \u015eadra,* s. Hak\u00eem Mirz\u00e2 Mu\u1e25ammad, who was one of the chief physicians of Persia (was in attendance on me). He had come from Persia in the reign of my revered father, and after the throne of rule had been adorned by this suppliant, as he was distinguished above all others by natural skill and experience (ta\u1e63arruf-i-tab\u00ee\u2018at), I was attended to by him, and I distinguished him with the title of Mas\u00eehu-z-zam\u00e2n (Messiah of the Age). I made his position more honourable than that of the other Court-physicians, with the idea that at some crisis he would help me. That ungrateful man, in spite of the claims which I had on him, though he saw me in such a state, did not give me medicines or treat me. Notwithstanding that I distinguished him beyond all the physicians who were waiting on me, he would not undertake my cure. However great attention I showed him and troubled myself to soothe him, he became more obstinate (sullab), and said: \u201cI have no such reliance on my knowledge that I can undertake the cure.\u201d It was the same with \u1e24ak\u00eem Ab\u00fb-l-Q\u00e2sim, s. \u1e24ak\u00eemu-l-mulk, notwithstanding his being a kh\u00e2naz\u00e2d, and what was due for his bringing up; he professed himself suspicious and afraid, and that considering the matter in his mind, he was terrified and vexed, and how, then, could he prescribe a remedy? As there was no help for it, I gave them all up, and weaning my heart from all visible remedies, gave myself up to the Supreme Physician. As drinking alleviated my sufferings, I took to it in the daytime, contrary to my habit, and gradually I carried this to excess. When the weather became hot, the evil effects of this increased, and my weakness and laboured breathing were augmented. N\u00fbr Jah\u00e2n Beg\u00e2m, whose skill and experience are greater than those of the physicians, especially as they are brought to bear through affection and sympathy, endeavoured to diminish the number of my cups, and to carry out the remedies that appeared appropriate to the time, and soothing to the condition. Although previously to this she had approved of the remedies\n\n* Elliot, VI. 448, the Ma\u2019\u0101\u015firu-l-Umar\u00e2, I. 577, and P\u00e2dishah-n\u00e2ma I., Part II., 347.\nmade use of by the physicians, yet at this time I relied on her kindness. She, by degrees, lessened my wine, and kept me from things that did not suit me, and food that disagreed with me. I hope that the True Physician will grant me perfect recovery from the hospital of the hidden world.\n\nOn Monday, the 22nd* of the same month, corresponding with the 25th of Shaww\u0101l, A.H. 1030 (2 September, 1621), the feast of my solar weighing took place auspiciously and happily. As in the past year (of my life) I had suffered from severe illness, I had passed it in continuous pain and trouble. In thankfulness that such a year ended well and in safety, and that in the commencement of the present year the signs of health became apparent, N\u016br Jah\u0101n Begam begged that her Vakils might make the arrangements for the entertainment (of the solar weighment). In truth, they prepared one which increased the astonishment of beholders. From the date on which N\u016br Jah\u0101n Begam entered into the bond of marriage with this suppliant, although in all weighing entertainments, both solar and lunar, she had made such arrangements as were becoming to the State, and knew what were the requirements of good fortune and prosperity; yet on this occasion she had paid greater attention than ever to adorn the assembly, and arrange the feast. All the servants of approved service and the domestics who knew my temperament, who in that time of weakness had constantly been present and been ready to sacrifice their lives, and had fluttered round my head like moths, were now honoured with suitable kindnesses, such as dresses of honour, jewelled sword-belts, jewelled daggers, horses, elephants, and trays full of money, each according to their positions. And though the physicians had not done good service, yet in consideration of the slight contempt\u2020 with which they had been treated for two or three days, they\n\n* Text wrongly has 12th. Jah\u0101ngir\u2019s birthday was on the 18th Shahr\u012bwar.\n\n\u2020 Khiffat\u012b. I am not sure of the reading. One B.M. MS. seems to have \u1e25aqq\u012b, and perhaps the meaning is that the physicians had already been abundantly recompensed for their labour for two or three days, \u1e25aqq\u012b being taken as equal to \u1e25aqq-i-sa\u2018\u012b.\nreceived various favours, and on the occasion of this feast also, they received presents in jewels and cash.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the weighment, trays of gold and silver were poured out by way of ni\u1e63\u0101r (coin-scattering) into the hope-skirts of the ministers of amusement (ahl-i-nish\u0101t), and of the poor. Jotik R\u0101y, astrologer, who had given the glad news of my recovery and restoration to health, I had weighed against muhars and rupees, and by this method a present was made* him of 500 muhars and 7,000 rupees. At the end of the entertainment the offerings she (N\u016br Jah\u0101n) had prepared for me were produced. Of the jewels, jewelled ornaments, cloths and various rarities I selected what I approved of. Altogether the cost of this great entertainment which N\u016br Jah\u0101n Begam gave was recorded to be two lacs of rupees, exclusive of what she laid before me as offerings. In previous years, when I was in health, I weighed 3 maunds and 1 or 2 seers more or less, but this year, as a result of my weakness and leanness, I was only 2 maunds and 27 seers.\n\nOn Thursday, the 1st of the Divine month of Mihr, I\u2018tiq\u0101d K., the Governor of Kashmir, was promoted to the mansab of 4,000 and 2,500 horse, and R\u0101ja Gaj Singh to that of 4,000 and 3,000 horse. When the news of my illness reached my son, Sh\u0101h Parw\u012bz, without waiting for a farman he came to see me, being unable to restrain himself. On the 14th\u2020 of the same month (September 25, 1621), at an auspicious hour and propitious time, that fortunate son had the good fortune to kiss the threshold, and went three times round the couch (takht). However much I adjured him and forbade him to do so, he insisted the more in lamentation and importunity. I took him by the hand and drew him towards me, and by way of kindness and affection held him fast in an embrace, and displayed great love to him. I hope that he may enjoy a long life with prosperity.\n\nAt this time Rs. 20,00,000 were sent to Khurram for the expenses of the army of the Deccan by Allah-d\u0101d K., who\n\n* A little before his weight came only to Rs. 6,500 (p. 329 of text). But possibly Jah\u0101ngir means that he had himself weighed for Jotik\u2019s benefit.\n\n\u2020 Elliot, VI. 381.\nwas honoured with an elephant and a standard. On the 28th Qiy\u0101m K., chief huntsman, died a natural death. He was a confidential servant, and apart from his skill in hunting, looked over every trifling detail relating to it, and consulted my pleasure in it. In short, I was much grieved at this event. I hope that God may grant him forgiveness.\n\nOn the 29th the mother of N\u016br Jah\u0101n Begam died. Of the amiable qualities of this matron (Kad-b\u0101n\u016b) of the family of chastity what can I write? Without exaggeration, in purity of disposition and in wisdom and the excellencies that are the ornament of women no Mother of the Age* was ever born equal to her, and I did not value\u2020 her less than my own mother. With regard to the attachment that I\u2019tim\u0101du-d-daula bore towards her it is certain that no husband was equal to him. Here one must imagine what had happened to that grief-stricken old man. Also with regard to the attachment of N\u016br Jah\u0101n Begam to her mother what can one write? A son like \u0100\u1e63af K., exceedingly intelligent and clever, rent in pieces his robe of patience and left off the dress of men of the social state (lit., men of dependence, or connection). At the sight of his dear son, the grief and sorrow of the father, wounded at heart, increased more and more. However much we admonished him, it had no result. On the day on which I went to condole with him, as the disturbance of his mind and grief of his heart had commenced, I spoke a few words of admonition by way of affection and kindness, but did not urge him. I left him until (the sense of) his calamity should abate. After some days I ministered to his inward wound the balm of kindness, and brought him back to the position of sociable beings. Although in order to please me and satisfy my mind he outwardly controlled himself, and made a show of resignation, yet with regard to his affection for her what resignation could there be?\n\n* M\u0101dar-i-dahr.\n\u2020 Text and MSS. have m\u0101dar-i-\u016br\u0101, \u201cher mother\u201d (?). Perhaps we should read m\u0101 \u016br\u0101, \u201cwe (esteemed) her not less than our own mother.\u201d Or it may be that the \u201cher\u201d means N\u016br Jah\u0101n, and that Jah\u0101ng\u012br means he esteemed his mother-in-law as much as his own mother.\nOn the 1st of the Divine month of Ab\u0101n, Sar-buland K., J\u0101n-sip\u0101r K., and B\u0101q\u012b K., were honoured with the gift of drums. \u2018Abdu-llah K. had gone to his jagir without the leave of the Subahdar* of the Deccan: I accordingly told the Chief Diwans to deprive him of his jagir, and I\u2019tim\u0101d R\u0101y was ordered to act as a saz\u0101wul, and to send him back to the Deccan.\n\nIt has been recorded with regard to the case of Masi\u1e25u-z-zam\u0101n (\u1e24ak\u012bm \u1e62adr\u0101) that, notwithstanding what was due from him for his bringing-up and my kindness to him, he had not the grace to attend upon me in such an illness, and more strange still is it that he suddenly threw off the veil of modesty and asked for leave to undertake a journey to the Hijaz, and make a pilgrimage to the holy house. Inasmuch as at all times and under all circumstances the reliance of this suppliant is on the Lord, that needs no return, and the gracious Creator, I gave him leave with an open brow. Though he had all kinds of things (for the journey) I made him a present of Rs. 20,000 in aid of his expenses, and I hope that the Supreme Physician, without the assistance of physicians and the means of medicine, may grant this suppliant complete recovery from the Dispensary of His mercy.\n\nAs the air of Agra, in consequence of the increase of the temperature, did not agree with me, on Monday, the 13th of the Divine month of Ab\u0101n and 16th year (of my reign), the standards were raised to go towards the hill country of the North, so that if the air of that quarter should be equable, I might choose some spot of ground on the bank of the River Ganges, and found a city there, to make a permanent place of residence for the hot weather, or else turn the reins of purpose in the direction of Kashmir. Leaving Mu\u1e93affar K. to guard and administer Agra, I dignified him with drums, a horse, and an elephant. Having appointed his nephew, M. Mu\u1e25ammad faujdar of the city, I gave him the title of Asad K., and selected him for increase of mansab. Having exalted B\u0101q\u012br K. to the duty of the Subah of Oudh, I dismissed him. On the 26th of the said month my prosperous son Sh\u0101h Parw\u012bz\n\n* That is, Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n (see Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 186).\nobtained leave to proceed from Mathura to Bihar and his jagir. I gave him leave after presenting him with a special dress of honour, a n\u0101dir\u012b, a jewelled dagger, a horse, and an elephant. I hope that he may enjoy long life. On 4 \u0100zar, Mukarram K., governor of Delhi, was exalted with the good fortune of paying his respects. On the 6th I alighted at Delhi, and having halted two days in Salimgarh I employed myself with the pleasure of sport. At this time it was reported to me that J\u0101do R\u0101y Kaitha (or Kathiya), who is one of the leading Sardars of the Deccan, by the guidance of good fortune and reliance on God, had elected for loyalty, and had been enrolled amongst the loyal servants. Bestowing on him a dress of honour and a jewelled dagger, I sent a gracious farman to him by the hand of Nar\u0101yan D\u0101s R\u0101thor. On the 1st of the Divine month of Dai, corresponding with the 7th \u1e62afar, A.H. 1031, Maq\u1e63\u016bd, brother of Q\u0101sim K., was honoured with the title of H\u0101shim K. and H\u0101shim Beg Kh\u016bsh\u012b* with that of J\u0101n-ni\u1e63\u0101r K.\n\nOn the 7th of the same month the camp was pitched at Hardw\u0101r on the bank of the Ganges. It is one of the most famous places of worship of the Hindus, and many brahmans and recluses have chosen a corner of retirement in this place and worship God according to the rule of their religion. I gave alms in cash and goods to each of them according to his requirements. As the climate of this skirt of the hills was not approved by me, and I could not see a spot of ground on which to make a permanent residence, I proceeded towards the skirt of the hill country of Jammu and Kangra.\n\nAt this time it was reported to me that R\u0101ja Bh\u0101o Singh had died in the Deccan (become a traveller on the road of non-existence). From excess of wine-drinking he had become very weak and low. Suddenly a faintness came over him. However much the physicians tried remedies for him and burnt scars on the top of his head, he did not come to his senses; for a night and a day he lay without perception, and died the next day. Two wives and eight concubines burnt themselves in the fire of fidelity for him. Jagat Singh, his elder brother, and Mah\u0101 Singh, his nephew, had spent the\n\n* The MSS. seem to have Khost\u012b\u2014i.e., of Khost.\ncoin of their lives in the wine-business, and the aforesaid, not taking warning from them, sold sweet life for bitter fluid. He was of very good disposition and sedate. From the days when I was a prince he was constantly in my service, and by the blessing of my education had reached the high rank of 5,000. As he left no son, I dignified the grandson of his elder brother, though of tender years, with the title of Raja, and gave him the mansab of 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse. The pargana of Amber, his native place, was assigned to him as jagir, according to former custom, in order that his family might not be dispersed. A\u1e63\u0101lat K., s. Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n, was promoted to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 500 horse. On the 20th* of the same month I halted at the saray of Alw\u0101t\u016b.\u2020\n\nAs I am constantly engaged in the pleasure of hunting, and the flesh of animals I have killed with my own hand is very much to my taste, in consequence of the suspicions and caution that I have in such matters, I order them to be cleaned in my presence, and myself inspect their stomachs to see what they have eaten and what the food of the animals is. If by chance I see anything to which I have a dislike I forbear from eating the flesh. Before this I was not inclined towards any kind of waterfowl except the *sona* (golden duck ?). When I was at Ajmir I saw a tame *sona* duck eating horrible worms. From seeing this, my taste turned against it, and I gave up eating tame *sona* ducks until now, when a duck was caught, and I ordered them to clean it in my presence. From its crop there first came out a small\u2021 fish: after this there appeared a bug\u00a7 so large that I could not believe till I saw it with my own eye that it could swallow a thing of such a size. Briefly I this day determined that I would not eat waterfowl. Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam represented that the flesh of the white heron (*uq\u0101b-i-safid*) was very delicious and tender. I accordingly sent for a white heron, and ordered them to clean it in my presence. By chance there came out of its crop ten\n\n---\n\n* Text 8th, but should be 20th.\n\u2020 Alwan\u016b in MSS. It appears to be Aluwa, 11 m. S.-E. of Sirhind.\n\u2021 Text *pahangi*, which seems unintelligible. The MSS. have *m\u0101h\u012bki(?)-i-kh\u016brd*, \u201ca small fish.\u201d\n\u00a7 *Baqqa*.\nbugs in a manner disgusting to me, at the remembrance of which I am distressed and disgusted.\n\nOn the 21st the garden of Sirhind brought joy to my senses, and on the day of halt there I delighted myself by going round and looking at it. At this time Khw\u0101ja Ab\u016b-l-\u1e24asan came from the Deccan, and had the good fortune to wait on me. He had great favour shown him. On the 1st of the Divine month of Bahman I halted at N\u016br-Sar\u0101y.* The mansab of Mu\u2018tamid K., original and increased, was ordered to be 2,000 personal and 600 horse. Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam was made governor of Allahabad,\u2020 and having been presented with a horse, a dress of honour, and a jewelled sword, took his leave. Muqarrab K. was selected for the mansab of 5,000 personal and horse. On Thursday, when I was encamped on the bank of the Biy\u0101h (Be\u0101s), Q\u0101sim K. came from Lahore, and had the good fortune to wait on me. H\u0101shim K., his brother, with the Zamindars of the country bordering on the hills, had the honour of kissing the threshold.\n\nB\u0101so\u2019i,\u2021 the zamindar of Talw\u0101ra, brought me a bird, which the hill-people call j\u0101n-bahan. Its tail resembles the tail of the q\u012brq\u0101wul (pheasant), which is also called the tazr\u016b, and its colour is exactly like that of the hen-pheasant, but it is half as large again. The circle round the eyes of this bird is red, while the orbit of the pheasant is white. The said B\u0101so\u2019i stated that this bird lived in the snow-mountains, and that its food was grass and other stuff. I have kept pheasants and have reared young ones, and have often eaten the flesh both of young birds and of mature ones. One may say that there is no comparison between the flesh of the pheasant and this bird. The flesh of the latter is much more delicate. Among the birds which I saw in the hill-country one was the ph\u016bl-paik\u0101r,\u00a7 which the Kashmiris call sonl\u016b. It is one-\n\n* Founded by N\u016br Jah\u0101n (see Cunningham, \u201cArch\u00e6ological Reports,\u201d XIV. 62).\n\u2020 Spelt Ilah-b\u0101s.\n\u2021 I have translated this passage from the MSS., which differ a good deal from the text. Talw\u0101ra was in the B\u0101r\u012b D\u016b\u2019\u0101b Sark\u0101r (Jarrett, II. 318.)\n\u00a7 Apparently this is the pulpaikar of B\u0101bar (Erskine, 320), though the two descriptions do not altogether agree. Perhaps it is a hornbill.\neighth (nim saw\u0101'\u012b?) less than a pea-hen. The back, tail, and wings resemble those of the bustard, and are blackish, with white spots. The breast to the end of the bosom is black, with white spots, and some red ones. The ends of the feathers are fiery red, and very lustrous and beautiful. From the end of the back of the neck it is also brilliantly black. On the top of its head it has two fleshy horns of a turquoise colour. The skin of its orbits and round its mouth is red. Below its throat there is skin round it enough to cover the palms of two hands, and in the middle of this the skin is of a violet colour of the size of a hand, with blue spots in the middle. Around it each streak is of a blue colour, consisting of eight plumes; round the blue streak it is red to the breadth of two fingers, like the peach flower, and again round its neck is that blue-coloured streak: it has red legs also. The live bird, which was weighed, came to 152 tolahs. After it was killed and cleaned it weighed 139 tolahs. Another bird is of a golden colour: this the people of Lahore call Shan* (?) and the Kashmiris p\u016b\u1e6d. Its colour is like that of a peacock's breast. Above its head is a tuft (k\u0101kul). Its tail of the width of five fingers is yellow, and is like the long feather (shah-par) of the peacock, and its body as large as that of a goose. The neck of the goose is long and shapeless: that of this one is short, and has a shape.\n\nMy brother, Sh\u0101h 'Abb\u0101s, had asked for golden birds,\u2020 and I sent some to him by his ambassador. On Monday\u2021 the ceremony of my lunar weighing took place. At this entertainment N\u016br Jah\u0101n Begam gave dresses of honour to forty-five of the great Amirs and private servants. On the 14th of the same month the camp was pitched at the village of Bahlwan \u00a7 belonging to the Sib\u0101 district. As I constantly longed for the\n\n* The MSS. have sal and l\u016b\u1e6d.

Sibah is mentioned at p. 317, ibid. The text has S\u012bt\u0101.\nair of Kangra and the hill-country above-mentioned, I left the large camp at this place, and proceeded to inspect the said fort with some of my special servants and attendants. As I'tim\u0101du-d-daula was ill I left him in the camp, and kept \u0160\u0101diq K., the chief Bakhshi, there to look after him and guard the camp. The next day news came that his state had undergone a change, and that the signs of hopelessness were apparent. I could not bear the agitation of N\u016br Jah\u0101n Begam, and, considering the affection which I bore towards him, I returned to the camp. At the end of the day I went to see him. It was the hour of his death agony. Sometimes he became unconscious and sometimes came back to his senses. N\u016br Jah\u0101n Begam indicated me, and said: \"Do you recognise (him)?\" At such a time he recited this couplet of Anw\u0101r\u012b:\n\nWere a mother-born blind man present\nHe'd recognise Majesty in the World-Adorner.\n\nI was for two hours at his pillow. Whenever he was conscious, whatever he said was intelligent and rational. In fine, on the 17th of the said month (Bahman) (about the end of January, 1622), after three gharis had passed he attained to eternal mercy. What shall I say about my feelings through this terrible event? He was a wise and perfect Vizier, and a learned and affectionate companion.\n\nVerse.*\n\nBy the reckoning of the eye, there's one frame less:\nBy Wisdom's reckoning, the lessening is more than thousands.\n\nThough the weight of such a kingdom was on his shoulders, and it is not possible for or within the power of a mortal to make everyone contented, yet no one ever went to I'tim\u0101du-d-daula with a petition or on business who turned from him in an injured frame of mind. He showed loyalty to the sovereign, and yet left pleased and hopeful him who was in need. In fact, this was a speciality of his. From the day on which his companion (his wife) attained to the mercy of God he cared no longer for himself, but melted away from\n\n* The couplet comes from Budags's elegy on Abu-l-Hasan Nahid Balkhi. See Aufi's Lababu-l-Albab. Browne's ed., Part II., p. 3.\nday to day. Although outwardly he looked after the affairs of the kingdom, and taking pains with the ordering of civil matters, did not withdraw his hand from business, yet in his heart he grieved at the separation, and at last, after three months and twenty days, he passed away. The next day I went to condole with his sons and sons-in-law, and, presenting 41 of his children and connections and 12 of his dependents with dresses of honour, I took them out of their mourning garments.\n\nThe next day I marched with the same purpose (as before), and went to see the fort of K\u0101ngra. In four stages the camp was pitched at the river B\u0101nganga. Alf K. and Shaikh Faizullah, the guards of the fort, had the good fortune to pay their respects. At this stage the offering of the Raja of Chamba* was laid before me. His country is 25 koss beyond K\u0101ngra. There is no greater Zamindari in these hills than this. The country is the asylum of all the Zamindars of the country. It has passes ('aqabah\u0101) difficult to cross. Until now he had not obeyed any king nor sent offerings. His brother also was honoured by paying his respects, and on his part performed the dues of service and loyalty. He seemed to me to be reasonable and intelligent and urbane. I exalted him with all kinds of patronage and favour.\n\nOn the 24th\u2020 of the same month I went to see the fort of K\u0101ngra, and gave an order that the Q\u0101\u1e93i, the Chief Justice (M\u012br \u2018Adl), and other learned men of Islam should accompany me and carry out in the fort whatever was customary, according to the religion of Mu\u1e25ammad. Briefly, having traversed about one koss, I went up to the top of the fort, and by the grace of God, the call to prayer and the reading of the Khutba and the slaughter of a bullock, which had not taken place from the commencement of the building of the fort till now, were carried out in my presence. I prostrated myself in thanksgiving for this great gift, which no king had hoped to receive, and ordered a lofty mosque to be built inside the fort. The fort of K\u0101ngra is situated on a high hill, and is so strong that if furnished with provisions and the necessaries for a fort\n\n* Text wrongly has Ch\u012b\u1e6d\u0101. Chamba is N.-W. of K\u0101ngra.\n\u2020 Elliot, VI. 382.\nthe hand of force cannot reach its skirt, and the noose of stratagem must fall short of it. Although there are heights (sar-k\u016bbh\u0101) in some places, and guns and muskets might reach (the fort) from them, yet no harm would accrue to the garrison, for they could move to another part of the fort,* and be safe. It has 23 bastions and seven gates. Its inner circumference is 1 koss and 15 ropes, its length is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) koss and 2 ropes (\\( \\text{\u1e6dan\u0101b} \\)), its breadth not more than 22 ropes nor less than 15. Its height is 114 cubits. There are two reservoirs inside the fort, one 2 ropes long and \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) broad; the other is of the same length (?).\u2020\n\nAfter going round the fort I went to see the temple of Durg\u0101, which is known as Bhawan.\u2021 A world has here wandered in the desert of error. Setting aside the infidels whose custom is the worship of idols, crowds on crowds of the people of Islam, traversing long distances, bring their offerings and pray to the black stone (image). Near the temple, and on the slope of the hill there is a sulphur-mine (\\( \\text{k\u0101n} \\)), and its heat causes flames to continually burst forth. They call it Jw\u0101l\u0101 Mukh\u012b\u00a7 (Flame-Face or Burning Mouth), and regard it as one of the idol\u2019s miracles. In fact, Hindus, while knowing the truth,|| deceive the common people. Hindus say\u00b6 that when the life of Mah\u0101deo\u2019s wife came to an end and she drank the draught of death, Mah\u0101deo, in his great love and attachment\n\n* The fort was destroyed by the earthquake of 1905 (I.G., XIV. 397). Presumably Jah\u0101ngir\u2019s mosque was also destroyed then.\n\n\u2020 The breadth of the second tank is not mentioned in the MSS.\n\n\u2021 \u201cThe present temple of Bajreswari Devi is at Bhawan, a suburb of K\u0101ngra\u201d (I.G., XIV. 386).\n\n\u00a7 See I.G., XIV. 86, and Jarrett, II. 314 and n. 1. Jarrett states that Jw\u0101l\u0101 Mukh\u012b is two days\u2019 journey from K\u0101ngra. Apparently Jah\u0101ngir took his statement from the \u0100y\u012bn, which has the words \u201cin the vicinity\u201d (Jarrett, ibid.). Jarrett\u2019s statement that Jw\u0101l\u0101 Mukh\u012b is two days\u2019 journey from K\u0101ngra is taken from Tieffenthaler, I. 108. Tieffenthaler adds that the distance is 14 to 15 miles (leagues, or kosses). He speaks of the Fort of Kangra as being only one-fourth of a mille in circumference. The image, he states, was that of Bhowani, and represented the lower part of the goddess\u2019s body. The head was alleged to be at Jw\u0101l\u0101 Mukh\u012b.\n\n|| I.e., know the physical cause of the flame.

When some time had passed in this manner, her form dissolved and dropped asunder, and each limb fell in a different place: they give honour and dignity to the place according to the dignity and grace of the member. As the breast, which when compared with other members has the greatest dignity, fell in this place, they hold it more precious than any other. Some maintain that this stone, which is now a place of worship for the vile infidels, is not the stone which was there originally, but that a body of the people* of Islam came and carried off the original stone, and threw it into the bottom of the river, with the intent that no one could get at it. For a long time the tumult of the infidels and idol-worshippers had died away in the world, till a lying brahman hid a stone for his own ends, and going to the Raja of the time said: \u201cI saw Durg\u0101 in a dream, and she said to me: \u2018They have thrown me into a certain place: quickly go and take me up.\u2019\u201d The Raja, in the simplicity of his heart, and greedy for the offerings of gold that would come to him, accepted the tale of the brahman, and sent a number of people with him, and brought that stone, and kept it in this place with honour, and started again the shop of error and misleading. But God only knows!\n\nFrom the temple I went to see the valley which is known as K\u016bh-i-Mad\u0101r.\u2020 It is a delightful place. From its climate, the freshness of its verdure, and its delightful position it is a place of pleasure worthy to be seen. There is a waterfall here which pours down water from the top of the hill. I ordered them to put up a symmetrical building there. On the 25th\n\n* The temple was sacked by Ma\u1e25m\u016bd of Ghazn\u012bn.\n\n\u2020 This might be Koh-i-Mand\u0101r, the hill which was used as a churning-stick by the gods. There is a hill of this name in Bhagalpur district which is known as Mand\u0101rgiri. But probably K\u016bh-i-Mad\u0101r here means the centre-hill, for in the Bib. Ind. text of the \u0100yin-i-Akbar\u012b, I. 538, two lines from foot, it is said that the place is called J\u0101landh\u0101r\u012b, and a note (7) gives the various reading, \u201cthis spot is regarded as the centre,\u201d \u201csar-i-zam\u012bn-r\u0101 mad\u0101r pind\u0101rand.\u201d Apparently it is regarded as the central place because the breast fell here, Jarrett, II. 314, n. According to the list given there the right breast fell at J\u0101landhara and the tongue at Jw\u0101l\u0101 Mukh\u012b.\nof the month the standards were turned back to return. Having presented Alf K. and Shaikh Faizu-llah with horses and elephants I left them to defend the fort. Next day I encamped at the fort of N\u016brp\u016br.* It was reported to me that in this neighbourhood there were many jungle fowl. As I had never yet caught these, I made a halt of another day, and enjoyed myself with the sport, having caught four. One cannot distinguish them in shape and colour from domestic fowls. One of the peculiarities of these birds is that if they are caught by the feet and turned upside down, wherever they are taken they make no sound, and remain silent, contrary to the domestic fowl, which makes an outcry. Until the domestic fowl is plunged into hot water its feathers do not come off easily. The jungle fowl, like the partridge and podna,\u2020 can be plucked when dry. I ordered them to roast them. It was found that the flesh of the full-grown ones was very tasteless and dry. The chickens had some juiciness, but were not good to eat. They cannot fly farther than a bow-shot. The cock\u2021 is chiefly red, and the hen black and yellow. There are many in this N\u016brp\u016br jungle. The ancient name of N\u016brp\u016br is Dh\u0101mer\u012b.\u00a7 Since R\u0101ja B\u0101so built the fort and made houses and gardens they call it N\u016brp\u016br, after my name. About Rs. 30,000 were expended on the building. Certes, the buildings Hindus construct after their fashion, however much they decorate them, are not pleasant. As the place was fit and the locality enchanting, I ordered them to spend Rs. 1,00,000 out of the public treasury, and to erect buildings at it, and to make lofty edifices suited to the spot.\n\nAt this time it was reported to me that there was a Sanny\u0101s\u012b Mot\u012b|| in the neighbourhood who had entirely renounced\n\n* I.G., new ed., XIX. 232.\n\u2020 Podna, or b\u016bdana.

See infra.

I ordered them to bring him that I might ascertain the real state of affairs. They call Hindu devotees Sarb b\u0101s\u012b.* By usage the word has become Sanny\u0101s\u012b (laying down everything). There are many degrees among them, and there are several orders among the Sarb b\u0101s\u012b. Among them there is the Mot\u012b order. They put themselves into the figure of a cross (?)(salb iikhtiy\u0101r m\u012bkunand) and surrender themselves (taslim\u2020 mis\u0101zand). For instance, they never speak. If for ten days and nights they stand in one place, they do not move their feet forwards or backwards; in fact, make no movement at all, and remain like fossils. When he came into my presence I examined him, and found a wonderful state of persistence. It occurred to me that in a state of drunkenness and absence of mind and delirium, some change might be wrought in him. Accordingly I ordered them to give him some cups of spirit ('araq) of double strength. This was done in royal fashion (liberally ?), but not the least change took place, and he remained in the same impassive state. At last his senses left him, and they carried him out like a corpse. God Almighty granted him mercy so that he did not lose his life. Certainly there was great persistence in his nature.\n\nAt this time B\u012b-badal K. presented me with the chronogram of the conquest of Kangra, and that of the foundation of the mosque which I had ordered. As he had hit it off well, I here record it:\n\nVerse.\n\nWorld-gripper, World-giver, World-holder, World-king,\nWith the sword of gh\u0101zi-ship he conquered this fort.\nWisdom spoke the date \"The Jahangiri Fortune opened this fort.\"\n\nin the figure of a cross. In Tavernier, II. 378, of ed. of 1676, this is the 8th posture of ascetics, and at that page and at 376 there are figures of such ascetics. The I.O. MSS. have salab, \"mourning,\" instead of salb.\n\n* Sarva v\u0101si means \"all-abiding.\" Perhaps the word should be Sarva n\u0101si, \"all destroying.\"\n\u2020 For taslim, see Hughes' Dict. of Islam. Possibly we should read ta\u0161lib, \"make the sign of the cross.\"\nHe composed the chronogram* of the building of the mosque as follows:\n\n**Verse.**\n\nN\u016bru-d-d\u012bn Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101ng\u012br s.

On the 4th of the same month I pitched in the neighbourhood of the pargana of Kashh\u016bna.\u2021 On this day Khw\u0101ja Ab\u016b-l-\u1e24asan was raised to the lofty dignity of supreme Diwan. I conferred dresses of honour on 32 individuals of the Deccan Amirs. Ab\u016b Sa\u02bf\u012bd, grandson of I\u2019tim\u0101du-d-daula, was raised to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 500 horse. At this time a report came from Khurr\u0101m that Khusrau, on the 8th\u00a7 (20th) of the month, had died of the disease of colic pains (q\u016blanj), and gone to the mercy of God.\n\nOn the 19th of the month I pitched on the bank of the Bihat (Jhelam). Q\u0101sim K. was raised to the mansab of 3,000 personal and 2,000 horse. R\u0101ja Kishan D\u0101s was selected for the duty of faujdar of Delhi, and his mansab was fixed at 2,000 personal and 500 horse, original and increased.\n\n* The chronogram of the taking of the fort yields 1029, and that of the building of the mosque 1031.\n\u2020 N\u016br\u0101n\u012b, \u201cillumined,\u201d an allusion to Jahangir\u2019s name.\n\u2021 The MSS. have Kaht\u016bma apparently. ?

Khusrau died in the Deccan, and presumably at Burhanpur or \u0100s\u012br. 20 Bahman, 1031, corresponds to January 29, 1622, O.S. But the date of his death has not been quite determined. See J.R.A.S. for 1907, p. 601.\nPreviously to this, huntsmen and yas\u0101wul\u0101n (guards) had been ordered to prepare a jarga (hunting-ring) in the shik\u0101r-g\u0101h (hunting-place of) Girjh\u0101k. When it was reported to me that they had brought the game into the enclosure, on the 24th of the month I went out to hunt with some of my special servants. Of hill quchg\u0101r (rams ?) and gazelles 124* head were taken. On this day it was reported that \u0179afar K. s. Zain K., had died.

MSS. have 121 instead of 124, and they add to the information about \u0179afar K. that he died in Ghaznin. They also give his son\u2019s name as Sa\u2018\u0101datu-llah. The Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, p. 191, has 121 hill sheep, m\u0101rkh\u016br and deer.\nTHE SEVENTEENTH\nNEW YEAR'S FEAST AFTER THE\nAUSPICIOUS ACCESSION\n\nOn the eve of Monday, the \u2014\u2014,* of the month of Jum\u0101da-l-awwal, A.H. 1031, March 10-12, 1622, after one watch, five gharis and a fraction had passed, the sun that illuminates the world lighted the mansion of Aries, and the 17th year of the reign of this suppliant began auspiciously and happily. On this joy-increasing day \u0100\u1e63af K. was promoted to the mansab of 6,000 personal and horse. Having given Q\u0101sim K. leave to proceed to the government of the Panjab, I presented him with a horse, an elephant, and a dress of honour. Eighty thousand darbs were given to Zamb\u012bl Beg, ambassador of the ruler of Persia. On the 6th of the same month (Farward\u012bn) the royal camp was at R\u0101walpindi. F\u0101z\u012bl K. was promoted to the post of Bakhshi. Zamb\u012bl Beg was ordered to remain at ease in Lahore until the return of the victorious army from Kashmir. An elephant was conferred on Akbar-qul\u012b K. Gakkar.\n\nAt this time I frequently heard that the ruler of Persia had hastened from Khurasan for the purpose of conquering Qandahar. Although looking to our previous and present connections, it appeared very unlikely, and beyond all calculation, that such a great king should entertain such light and crude ideas, and himself come against one of my humble slaves who was in Qandahar with 300 or 400\u2020 servants, yet as\n\n* Date not given. The Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 191, has \"the 8th.\"\n\u2020 The Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, p. 192, speaks of a report of Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n that Khw\u0101ja \u2018Abdu-l-\u2018Az\u012bz Naqshband\u012b, the governor of Qandahar, had a garrison of 3,000 men.\ncaution is one of the duties of a ruler and becoming to a king, I sent Zainu-l-\u2018\u0100bid\u012bn, Bakhshi of A\u1e25ad\u012bs, with a gracious farman to Khurr\u0101m to come and wait on me with all possible speed with a victorious host, and elephants of mountain hugeness, and the numerous artillery that were assigned for his support in that Subah. So that, if these words should be near the truth, he might come and be despatched with an innumerable army and countless treasure, in order that he (the king of Persia) might discover the result of breaking faith and of wrong-doing.\n\nOn the 8th I halted at the fountain of \u1e24asan Abd\u0101l. Fida\u02bf\u012b K. was promoted to the mansab of 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse, and Badi\u02bfu-z-zam\u0101n was appointed Bakhshi of the A\u1e25ad\u012bs. On Friday, the 12th, Mah\u0101bat K., having come from Kabul, waited on me and had the good fortune to pay his respects, and became the recipient of daily-increasing favours. He presented 100 muhrs as a present and Rs. 10,000 as alms. Khw\u0101ja Ab\u016b-l-\u1e24asan passed his followers before me in review; 2,500 well-horsed cavalry were enrolled, of whom 400 were matchlock men. At this stage a gamurgha hunt was arranged, and I shot* 33 hill q\u016bchq\u0101r (mountain sheep), etc. At this time \u1e24ak\u012bm M\u016bmin\u0101, at the recommendation of the pillar of the State, Mah\u0101bat K., had the good fortune to wait on me. With power and courage he undertook my cure, and I hope that his coming may prove auspicious to me. The mansab of Am\u0101nu-llah, s. Mah\u0101bat K., was fixed at 2,000 personal and 1,800 horse. On the 19th I encamped near Pakhl\u012b, and the feast of the culmination was held there. Having given Mah\u0101bat K. leave to return to Kabul, I gave him a horse, an elephant, and a dress of honour. The mansab of I\u02bftib\u0101r K. was ordered to be 5,000 personal and 4,000 horse. As he was an old servant, and had become very weak and old, I promoted him to the Subah of Agra, and entrusted to him the defence of the fort and the treasury, and, presenting him with an elephant, a horse, and a dress of\n\n* Jahangir appears on this occasion to have forgotten the vow he made in the 13th year. See Elliot, VI. 362. Jahangir\u2019s words are clear: \u201cba t\u012br u tufang and\u0101khtam.\u201d\nhonour, dismissed him. At the Pass of Kunwar* Mast, Ir\u0101dat K. came from Kashmir, and had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. On the 2nd of the Divine month of Urdjibihisht, I entered the enchanting region of Kashmir. Mir Mir\u0101n was promoted to the mansab of 2,500 personal and 1,400 horse. At this time, in order to ease the condition of the ryots and soldiery, I did away with the faujdari cess, and gave an order that in the whole of my dominions they should not impose anything on account of faujdari. Zabar-dast K., Master of the Ceremonies (Mir T\u016bzuk), was promoted to the mansab of 2,000 personal and 700 horse. On the 13th, by the advice of the physicians, and especially of \u1e24ak\u012bm M\u016bmin\u0101, I was lightened by being bled from my left leg. A present of a dress of honour was made to Muqarrab K., and one of 1,000 darbs to \u1e24ak\u012bm M\u016bmin\u0101. At the request of Khurr\u0101m the mansab of \u2018Abdu-llah K. was fixed at 6,000. Sar-far\u0101z\u2020 K. was honoured with the gift of drums. Bah\u0101dur K. Uzbeg, having come from Qandahar, had the good fortune to pay his respects: by way of nazar he gave 100 muhrs, and by way of charity offered Rs. 4,000. Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 K., governor of Thatta, had sent as an offering a Sh\u0101h-n\u0101ma and a Khamsa (quintet) of Shaikh Niz\u0101m\u012b illustrated by masters (of painting), along with other presents: these were laid before me. On the 1st of the Divine month of Khurd\u0101d Lashkar K. was exalted to the mansab of 4,000 personal and 3,000 horse, and to Mir Jumla was given that of 2,500 personal and 1,000 horse. Some of the Amirs of the Deccan were similarly honoured with an increase of mansab. Promotion was also given as follows: Sard\u0101r K., 3,000 and 2,500 horse; Sar-buland K., 2,500 personal and 2,200 horse; B\u0101q\u012b K., 2,500 and 2,000 horse; Sharza K., 2,500 and 1,200 horse; J\u0101n-sip\u0101r K., 2,000 personal and 2,000 horse; Mirz\u0101 W\u0101l\u012b, 2,500 and 1,000 horse; Mirz\u0101 Badi\u02bfu-z-zam\u0101n s. Mirz\u0101 Sh\u0101hr\u016bkh, 1,500 personal and horse; Z\u0101hid K., 1,500 and 700 horse; \u2018Aq\u012bdat K., 1,200 and 300\n\n* Apparently this is the Barahm\u016bla Pass. It is mentioned in the Akbar-n\u0101ma, III. 480-81 and 558, but does not appear on modern maps. Jahangir refers to it in the account of the 15th year, p. 294, and says it is the last of the passes.\n\n\u2020 Sar-afr\u0101z in No. 181.\nhorse; Ibr\u0101h\u012bm \u1e24usain K\u0101shghar\u012b, 1,200 and 600 horse; and Z\u016b-l-faq\u0101r K., 1,000 personal and 500 horse. R\u0101ja Gaj Singh and Himmat K. were selected for drums. On the 2nd of the Divine month of T\u012br, Sayyid B\u0101yaz\u012bd was honoured with the title of Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 K., and was also presented with drums. At this time Tahawwur K., who is one of the personal servants, was despatched with a gracious farman to summon my fortunate son Sh\u0101h Parw\u012bz.\n\nSome days before this, petitions came from the officials in Qandahar reporting the intention of the ruler of Persia to conquer Qandahar, but my mind, which is actuated by sincerity, looking to past and present relations, placed no reliance on the truth of this until the report of my son Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n arrived that Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s, with the armies of Iraq and Khurasan, had come and besieged Qandahar. I ordered them to fix an hour for leaving Kashmir. Khw\u0101ja Ab\u016b-l-\u1e24asan, the Diwan, and Bakhshi \u0160\u0101diq K. hastened to Lahore in advance of the victorious army to expedite the arrival of the princes of high degree with the armies of the Deccan, Gujarat, Bengal, and Behar, and to send on the Amirs who were present with the victorious stirrups, and those who one after another should come in from the districts of their jagirs to my son Khan J\u0101h\u0101n at Multan. At the same time the artillery, with the strings of warlike elephants, and the armoury* were to be prepared and forwarded. As there was little cultivation between Multan and Qandahar, the despatch of a large army without provisions was not to be thought of. It was therefore decided to encourage the grain-sellers, who in the language of India are called banj\u0101r\u0101, and, providing them with money, to take them along with the victorious army, so that there might be no difficulty about supplies. The Banj\u0101r\u0101s\u2020 are a tribe. Some of them have 1,000 bullocks, and some more or less. They take grain from different districts (bul\u016bk\u0101t) into the towns and sell it. They go along with the armies, and with such an army there would be\n\n* The I.O. MS., No. 181, adds \u201cand treasure.\u201d\n\u2020 \u201cWilson\u201d Glossary, p. 60. Elliot, Supp. Glossary, I. 52. The word seems connected with barinj, \u201crice.\u201d\n100,000 bullocks or more. It is hoped that by the grace of the Creator, the army will be furnished with numbers and arms so that there may be no delay or hesitation until it reach Isfahan, which is his (the Shah\u2019s) capital. A farman was sent to Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n to beware and not start in that direction (Qandahar) from Multan before the arrival of the victorious army, and not be disturbed, but attend to orders. Bah\u0101dur K. Uzbeg was selected to go as an auxiliary to the army of Qandahar, and favoured with a horse and dress of honour. F\u0101\u017cil K. was given the mansab of 2,000 personal and 750 horse.\n\nAs it had been brought to notice that the poor of Kashmir suffer hardships in the winter from the excessive cold, and live with difficulty, I ordered that a village of the rental of Rs. 3,000 or Rs. 4,000 should be entrusted to Mull\u0101 \u1e6c\u0101lib Isfah\u0101n\u012b,* to be expended in providing clothes for the poor, and for warming water, for purposes of ablution, in the mosques.\n\nAs it was reported that the Zamindars of Kishtwar had again raised their heads in disobedience and sin, and engaged in sedition and disturbance, Ir\u0101dat K. was ordered to proceed hot-foot, before they had time to establish themselves firmly, and having inflicted condign punishment on them to tear up the root of sedition. On this day Zainu-l-\u2018\u0100bid\u012bn, who had been sent to summon Khurr\u0101m, came and waited on me, and reported that the stipulation he made was that he should pass the rainy season in the fort of M\u0101nd\u016b, and then come to Court. His report was read. It did not like the style of its purport nor the request he made, and, on the contrary, the traces of disloyalty (b\u012b-daulat\u012b) were apparent. There being no remedy, an order was given that as he proposed to come after the rains, he should despatch the great Amirs, the servants of the Court who were employed in assisting him, and especially the Sayyids of B\u0101rha and Bukhara, the Shaikh-z\u0101das, the Afghans, and the Rajputs. M\u012brz\u0101 Rustam and I\u2019tiq\u0101d K. were ordered to go to Lahore in advance, and assist the army\n\n* This is the poet B\u0101b\u0101 \u1e6c\u0101lib Isfah\u0101n\u012b of Blochmann, 607.\n\u2020 Elliot, VI. 383.\nof Qandahar. Rs. 1,00,000 were given them as advance of pay, and I also granted drums to \u2018In\u0101yat K. and I\u2019tim\u0101d K. Ir\u0101dat K., who had hastened to punish the rebels of Kishtwar, having killed many of them and regained the mastery and established himself firmly, returned to duty. Mu\u2019tamid K. had been appointed Bakhshi to the army of the Deccan. As that matter was over* he was sent for at his own request. He came on this day, and on his arrival kissed the threshold.\n\nIt is a strange thing that when a pearl of the value of Rs. 14,000 or 15,000 was lost in the harem, Jotik R\u0101y, the astrologer, represented that it would be found in two or three days. \u0160\u0101diq K. Ramm\u0101l (soothsayer) represented that in the same two or three days it would come from a place which was perfectly clean and pure, such as the place of worship or oratory. A female soothsayer represented that it would soon be found, and that a woman with white skin would bring it in a state of ecstasy, and give it into the hand of the \u1e24a\u1e93rat (the king). It happened that on the third day one of the Turkish girls found it in the oratory, and all in smiles and in a happy frame of mind gave it to me. As the words of all three came true each one was favoured with an acceptable reward. This is written because it is not devoid of strangeness.\n\nAt this time I appointed Kaukab and Khidmatg\u0101r K., and others to the number of twelve in all, of the familiar servants to be saz\u0101wuls of the Amirs in the Deccan in order that they might exert themselves and send them forward as soon as possible to Court, so that they (the Am\u012brs) might be sent to the victorious army at Qandahar.\u2020 At this time it was frequently reported to me that Khurr\u0101m had taken into his possession some of the estates of the jagir of N\u016br Jah\u0101n Begam and Shahriy\u0101r, and especially the pargana of Dholpur, which had by the High Diwan been assigned to Shahriy\u0101r,\n\n* Not that the question of the Deccan had been settled, but that Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n had left Burhanpur and come to M\u0101nd\u016b. See Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 193.\n\n\u2020 Elliot, VI. 383.\nand had sent there an Afghan of the name of Dary\u0101, one of his own servants, with a body of men. Dary\u0101 fought with Shar\u012bfu-l-mulk, a servant of Shahriy\u0101r, who had been appointed to the faujdari of that region, and many were killed on both sides. Although in consequence of his (Khurram\u2019s) remaining in the fort of M\u0101nd\u016b, and the unreasonable requests made in his letter it appeared that his reason was turned, yet from hearing this news it became clear that he was unworthy of all the favours and cherishing I had bestowed on him, and that his brain had gone wrong. Accordingly I sent R\u0101ja R\u016bz-afz\u016bn, who was a confidential servant, to him, and made inquiries as to the cause of this boldness. He was ordered hereafter to behave properly, and not place his foot beyond the path of reasonableness and the high road of politeness, and content himself with the districts of his own jagir that he had obtained from the High Diwan. He must also beware not to form any intention of coming to wait upon me, but to send the body of the servants of the State I had requisitioned on account of the disturbance at Qandahar to the Court. If anything contrary to this order should come to notice, he would repent it.\n\nAt this time M\u012br Zah\u012bru-d-d\u012bn, the grandson of M\u012br Mir\u0101n, s. the famous Sh\u0101h Ni\u2018matu-llah, came from Persia and waited on me, and received as a present a dress of honour and 8,000 darbs. Uj\u0101l\u0101 Dakhan\u012b obtained leave to go to R\u0101ja B\u012br Singh Deo with a gracious farman in order that he should act as saz\u0101wul and collect the men. Previously to this, on account of the great regard and abundant affection I bore to Khurram and his sons, at the time when his son (Shuj\u0101\u2018) was very ill, I had determined that if God Almighty would grant him to me I would not again sport with a gun, and would inflict no injury on a living thing with my own hand. Notwithstanding my inclination and love for hunting, especially with a gun, I had given it up for five years. At this time, when I was greatly distressed at his unkind behaviour, I took again to sporting with a gun, and gave orders that nobody should remain in the palace without one. In a short time most of the servants took a liking to shooting with guns, and the\narchers,* in order to perform their duties, became cavalry soldiers.\n\nOn the 25th of the month, corresponding with the 7th Shaww\u0101l, at the favourable hour that had been chosen, I turned towards Lahore from Kashmir (apparently means Srinagar, the capital). I sent Bih\u0101r\u012b D\u0101s Brahman with a gracious farman to R\u0101n\u0101 Karan to the effect that he should bring his son with a body of men to pay his respects to me. M\u012br Z\u0101hiru-d-d\u012bn was promoted to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 400 horse. As he represented to me that he was in debt, I made him a present of Rs. 10,000. On the 1st of Shahriwar I encamped at the fountain of Achbal,\u2020 and on Thursday I had a feast of cups beside the fountain.\u2021 On this auspicious day my fortunate son Shahriy\u0101r was appointed to the Qandahar expedition, and was promoted to the mansab of 12,000 personal and 8,000 horse. A special dress of honour, with a n\u0101dir\u012b with pearl buttons, was also given him. At this time a merchant had brought two large pearls from the country of Turkey, one of them weighing $1\\frac{1}{4}$ mi\u1e63q\u0101ls, and the second 1 surkh less. N\u016br Jah\u0101n Begam bought the two for Rs. 60,000, and presented them to me as an offering on the same day. On Friday, the 10th, by the advice of \u1e24ak\u012bm M\u016bmin\u0101,\u00a7 I was relieved by bleeding from the arm. Muqarrab K., who has great skill in this art, always used to bleed me, and possibly never failed before, but now failed twice. Afterwards Q\u0101sim, his nephew, bled me. I gave him a dress of honour and Rs. 2,000, and gave 1,000 darbs to \u1e24ak\u012bm M\u016bmin\u0101. M\u012br Kh\u0101n, at the request of Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n, was promoted to the mansab of 1,500 and 900 horse.\n\n*Tarkash-band\u0101n*, literally quiver-holders. Apparently the meaning is that the archers who were footmen (see Blochmann, 254, about D\u0101khil\u012b troops) lost their vocation when guns came into use, and became cavalry soldiers. But the meaning in text may be that the archers took to practising with bows and arrows on horseback. It appears from a Dast\u016bru-l-\u02bfamal in the I.O., No. 1,855 (E. 2736) that the tarkash-bands were an inferior order of servants receiving 1,000 dams or less a year. They probably were not necessarily archers.\n\n\u2020 The Achh Dal of the \u0100y\u012bn, Jarrett, II. 358.\n\u2021 No. 181 has \u201cat V\u012brn\u0101g.\u201d\n\u00a7 P\u0101dsh\u0101h-n\u0101ma, I., Part II., p. 349.\nOn the 21st of the month the feast of my solar weighing took place, and the 54th year of the age of this suppliant at the throne of God began auspiciously and happily. I hope that the whole of my life will be spent in fulfilling the will of God. On the 28th, I went to see the waterfall of Ashar* (?). As this spring is famous for its sweetness and agreeable flavour, I weighed it in my presence against Ganges water, and that\u2020 of the valley of L\u0101r. The water of Ashar was 3 m\u0101sha heavier than that of the Ganges, and the latter was \u00bd m\u0101sha lighter than that of the valley of L\u0101r. On the 30th the camp was at Hir\u0101p\u016br. Though Ir\u0101dat K. had done his duty in Kishtwar well, yet as the ryots and inhabitants of Kashmir complained of his treatment of them, I promoted I\u2019tiq\u0101d K. to the governorship of Kashmir. I bestowed on him a horse, a dress of honour, and a special enemy-piercing\u2021 sword, and appointed Ir\u0101dat K. to do duty with the army of Qandahar. Having brought Kunwar Singh, the Raja of Kishtwar, out of the fortress of Gwalior, where he was imprisoned, I bestowed Kishtwar on him, and gave him a horse and a dress of honour, with the title of Raja. I sent \u1e24aidar Malik to Kashmir (i.e., Srinagar) to bring a canal from the valley of L\u0101r to the N\u016br-afz\u0101 garden, giving him Rs. 30,000 for the materials and labour. On the 12th of the month I came down from the hill country of Jamm\u016b, and pitched at Bhimbhar. The next day I had a qamurgha hunt. To D\u0101war-bakhsh, s. Khusrau, I gave the mansab of 5,000 personal and 2,000 horse. On the 24th I crossed the Chenab.\u00a7 Mirz\u0101 Rustam came from Lahore, and waited on me. On the same day A\u1e93al|| K., Khurr\u0101m\u2019s Diwan, bringing a petition from him, waited on me.

The Diwan Khw\u0101ja Ab\u016b-l-\u1e24asan and \u1e62\u0101diq K. Bakhshi, who had hastened to Lahore to make provision for the army of Qandahar, had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. On the 1st of the Divine month of \u0100b\u0101n, Am\u0101nu-llah, s. Mah\u0101bat K., was promoted to the mansab of 3,000 personal and 1,700 horse. A gracious farman was sent to summon Mah\u0101bat K. At this time \u2018Abdu-llah K., whom I had sent for for service at Qandahar, having come from the district of his jagir, paid his respects. On the 4th of the same month I entered the city of Lahore auspiciously and happily. Alf K. was promoted to the mansab of 2,000 and 1,500 horse. I gave\u2020 an order to the chief Diwans to levy the pay of the force of servants of the State who had been appointed for service at Qandahar out of the jagirs of Khurram, which were in the Sarkar of \u1e24i\u1e63\u0101r, and in the D\u016b-\u0101b and those regions. In the place of these he might take possession of districts from the Subah of Malwa and the Deccan, and Gujarat and Khandesh, wherever he wished. Presenting Af\u1e93al K. with a dress of honour I gave him leave to go. An order was passed that the Subahs of Gujarat, Malwa, the Deccan and Khandesh should be handed over to him (Khurram), and he might take up a permanent residence wherever he might wish, and employ himself in the administration of those regions. He was to send quickly the saz\u0101wuls who had been appointed to bring the servants of the State who had been summoned to my presence on account of the disturbance at Qandahar. After that he was to look after his own charge, and not depart from order: otherwise, he would repent. On this day I gave the best tipch\u0101q horse that was in my private stable to \u2018Abdu-llah K. On the 26th \u1e24aidar Beg and Wali Beg, envoys of the ruler of Persia, had an audience. After performing the ceremony of salutation they produced a letter from the Shah. My son Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n,\n\n* Compare Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 194 and 196. It is stated there that N\u016br Jah\u0101n would not allow Af\u1e93al K. to have an audience, and that he was dismissed without gaining his object.\n\n\u2020 See Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 196, where it is said that these orders were not really given by Jahangir, but were N\u016br Jah\u0101n\u2019s.\naccording to order, having come post from Multan, waited on me. He presented as offerings 1,000 muhrs, 1,000 rupees, and 18 horses. Mah\u0101bat K. was promoted to the mansab of 6,000 personal and 5,000 horse. I gave an elephant to M\u012brz\u0101 Rustam. R\u0101ja S\u0101rang Deo was appointed saz\u0101wul to R\u0101ja Bir Singh Deo. I told him to produce him at Court as quickly as possible. On* the 7th of the Divine month of \u0100zar the ambassadors of Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s, who had come at different times, were presented with dresses of honour and their expenses, and given leave to go. The letter he had sent by \u1e24aidar Beg making excuses in the matter of Qandahar has been given in this record of good fortune (Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma) along with my reply.\n\n**Letter of the King of Persia.**\n\n(After compliments, and good wishes for that \u201cbrother dear as life\u201d the letter proceeds as follows):\n\n\u201cYou will be aware that after the death of the Naw\u0101b Sh\u0101h Jannat-mak\u0101n (Sh\u0101h Tahm\u0101sp) great misfortunes befell Persia. Many territories which belonged to our saintly family passed out of possession, but when this suppliant at the throne of Grace became sovereign, he, by God\u2019s help, and the excellent measures of friends, recovered the hereditary lands which were in the possession of enemies. As Qandahar was held by the agents of your lofty family, I regarded you as myself, and did not make any objection. From feelings of unity and brotherhood we waited, thinking that you would, after the manner of your ancestors\u2020 who are in Paradise, voluntarily take the matter into your consideration. When you neglected to do this, I repeatedly, by writing and verbal messages, directly and indirectly, asked for the disposal of the question, thinking that perhaps that petty country (Qandahar) was not regarded as worthy of your notice. You said several times that by making over the territory to our family, the notions of enemies and censurers would be disposed of, and\n\n* Elliot, VI. 280.\n\u2020 This alludes to the facts that Hum\u0101y\u016bn promised Sh\u0101h Tahm\u0101sp that he would restore the fort after he had conquered India, and that Akbar had acknowledged the justice of Persia\u2019s claim.\npraters, enviers, and fault-finders would be put to silence. A faction* formerly delayed the settlement of this matter. As the truth of the affair was known to friends and enemies, and as no clear answer, either of refusal or concession, came from you, it occurred to me that I would go to Qandahar to see it, and to hunt. In this way the agents of my distinguished brother, in accordance with the ties of friendship which exist between us, might welcome us and wait upon us. By this means the relationship of union would be renewed, and would be made evident to the world, and the tongues of the envious and the evil-speaking be shortened. With this view, I set off without apparatus for taking forts, and when I came to Far\u0101h I sent a rescript to the governor of Qandahar, mentioning that I intended to see the place and hunt there. I did this in order that he might treat me as a guest. We also called the honourable Khw\u0101ja B\u0101q\u012b Kurkar\u0101q, and sent a message to the governor and the other officers in the fort to the effect that there was no difference between Your Majesty and ourselves, and that we were aware of each other's territories, and that we were coming to see the country. Therefore they were not to act in such a way as to give umbrage or to vex anyone. They did not receive the conciliatory order and message in the proper way, but showed obstinacy and a rebellious spirit. When I came to the fort I again called the honourable aforesaid (K. B\u0101q\u012b), and sent him with the message that I had directed my troops not to invest the fort till the lapse of ten days. They did not receive the wholesome advice, and were stubborn in their opposition. As there was nothing more to be done, the Persian army set about taking the fort, though it was in want of appliances, and soon levelled the walls and bastions with the ground. The garrison became straitened, and asked for quarter. We, too, maintained the ties of love which had existed from of old between the two exalted dynasties, and the brotherly relation which was formed between you and me when you were prince (Mirz\u0101); and which was an object of envy to contemporary sovereigns,\n\n* The clause is very obscure. Perhaps it is part of what Jahangir had said.\nand from my innate kindness forgave their errors and offences. Encompassing them with favours, I sent them safe and sound to your Court along with \u1e24aidar Beg Q\u016brb\u0101\u0161\u012b, who is one of the sincere \u0160\u016bf\u012bs of this family. Of a truth, the foundation of love and union, both inherited and acquired, on the part of this seeker after affection, has not grown old or decayed, and is strong so that no rupture in it can take place on account of any things which may have transpired owing to the action of Fate.\n\nVerse.\n\nBetween us and you there cannot be trouble,\nThere can be naught but love and trust.\n\n\"It is hoped that you, too, will preserve your affection for us, and that you will not approve of certain strange actions, and that if any suspicion about friendship arise you will endeavour by your innate goodness and continual love to efface it. May the ever-vernal flower of union and cordiality remain in bloom, and every effort be made to strengthen the foundations of concord, and to cleanse the fountains of agreement which regulate temperaments and territories. You will regard all our dominions as belonging to you, and will extend your friendship to everyone (in them ?), and will proclaim that it (Qandahar) has been given up to him ('Abb\u0101s) without any objection, and that such trifles are of no importance, and that though the governor and officers who were in the fort did some things which were obstacles to friendship, yet what took place was done by you and me. They performed the duties of service and life devotion. It is certain, too, that Your Majesty will be gracious to them, and will treat them with royal kindness, and will not shame me before them. What more need I write? May thy star-brushing standards ever be associated with the Divine aids!\"\n\nReply to the Letter of Shah 'Abb\u0101s.\n\n\"Unfeigned thanks, and pure thanksgivings are due to the sole object of worship (God) for that the maintenance of the compacts and treaties of great princes is the cause of the order of Creation and the repose of mankind. A proof of this is\nthe harmony and unity which existed between us and the exalted family (of Persia), and which were increased during our time. These things were the envy of contemporary sovereigns. The glorious Shah\u2014the star of heaven's army, the ruler of the nations, the adorner of the Kay\u0101n\u012b tiara, the fitting occupant of the throne of Chosroes, the fruitful tree of the gardens of sovereignty, the splendid nursling of the parterres of prophecy and saintship, the cream of the \u1e62afaw\u012b dynasty\u2014hath without ground or reason, engaged in disturbing the rose-garden of love and friendship and brotherhood in which for long periods there has been no possibility of a breath of confusion. Clearly the methods of union and concord among princes require that they make oaths of friendship to one another, and that there should be perfect spiritual agreement between them. There should be no need of physical contact, and still less should there be any necessity for visiting one another's countries for 'shooting and spectacle' (sair u shik\u0101r).\n\nVerse.\n\nAlas, a hundred times for the love passing thought!\n\n\"By the arrival of your loving letter apologizing for the 'spectacle and shooting' (sair u shik\u0101r) of Qandahar, which came with the honourable \u1e24ajdar Beg and Wal\u012b Beg, I became apprised of the bodily health of your angelic personality, and the flowers of joy were scattered over the world. Let it not be hidden from the world-adorning mind of my exalted and prosperous brother that until the arrival of the letter and messages brought by Zambil Beg no mention had been made by you in letters or verbal messages of your wish for Qandahar. At the time when we were engaged in visiting the delightful land of Kashmir, the Deccan lords, in their shortsightedness, extended their feet beyond the limits of obedience, and trod the path of rebellion. Accordingly it became necessary for me to chastise them. I moved my standards to Lahore, and appointed my worthy* son Sh\u0101h J\u0101h\u0101n to proceed against them with a victorious army. I myself was proceeding to\n\n* Farzand-i-barkh\u016brd\u0101r.\nAgra when Zambil Beg arrived, and produced your loving letter. I took it as a good omen, and went off to Agra to put down the enemies and the rebels. In the jewelled and pearl-dropping letter there was no mention of a wish for Qandahar. It was mentioned verbally by Zambil Beg. In reply, I said to him that I made no difficulty with regard to anything that my brother wished. Please God, after settling the Deccan affair, I would send him back in a manner suitable to my sovereignty. I also said that as he had made long marches he should repose for some days in Lahore, and that I would afterwards send for him. After coming to Agra, I sent for him and gave him leave to depart. As the favour of God attaches to this suppliant, I withdrew my mind from victories and proceeded to the Panjab. My intention was to send him away, but after disposing of some necessary matters I went to Kashmir on account of the hot weather. After coming there I sent for Zambil Beg in order to give him his leave. I also wished to show him something of that delightful country. Meanwhile news came that my prosperous brother had come to take Qandahar. This idea had never entered my mind, and I was entirely astonished. What could there be in a petty village that he should set out to take it, and that he should shut his eyes to so much friendship and brotherly feeling? Though truthful reporters sent the news, I could not credit it! When it became certain I immediately gave orders to \u2018Abdu-l-\u2018Aziz K. not to transgress in any way the good pleasure of that prosperous brother. Up to now the relationship of brotherhood stands firm, and I do not value the world in comparison therewith, nor do I consider any gift equal to it. But it would have been right and brotherly that he should have waited till the arrival of the ambassador. Perhaps he would be successful in the object* and claim for\n\n* It is noteworthy that Jahangir does not attempt to controvert the statement of Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s that Qandahar rightfully belonged to Persia. There is a very long account in the \u2018\u0100lam-\u0101r\u0101\u2019\u012b of the claims of Persia to Qandahar, and of the various attempts made to realize them, until at last it was taken by Sh\u0101h \u2018Abb\u0101s. See the account of the 35th year in the Teheran lithograph, p. 682, etc. The fort of Qandahar surrendered on 11 Sha\u2018b\u0101n, 1031, or June 11, 1622. The Shah\u2019s letter\nwhich he had come. When he ('Abb\u0101s) takes such steps before the return of the ambassador, to whom will mankind ascribe the merit of keeping compacts and of preserving the capital of humanity and liberality! May God preserve you at all times!\"\n\nAfter I had given leave to the ambassadors, I devoted all my energy to urging on the Qandahar force, and presented my son Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n, who had been sent for certain matters, with an elephant, a special horse, a jewelled sword and dagger, and a dress of honour. I sent him on as an advance guard, and directed him to remain in Multan until the arrival of Prince Shahriy\u0101r with the victorious army. B\u0101q\u012br K., who was faujdar of Multan, was summoned to Court, and I appointed 'Al\u012b-qul\u012b Beg Darman to assist him (Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n), and raised him to the mansab of 1,500. In the same manner, having raised M. Rustam to the mansab of 5,000, I appointed him to the duty of assisting that son with the (Qandahar) army. Lashkar K. came from the Deccan, and waited on me, and was also attached to that army. Allah-d\u0101d K. Afgh\u0101n, M. \u1e6cs\u0101 Tarkh\u0101n, Mukarram K., Ikram K., and other Amirs, who had come from the Deccan and from their fiefs, after being presented with horses and dresses of honour, were sent with Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n. 'Umdatu-s-saltana \u0100\u1e63af K. was sent to Agra to bring to Court the whole of the treasure in muhrs and rupees which had accumulated from the beginning of the reign of my father. \u0100\u1e63\u0101lat K., s. Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n, was promoted to the mansab of 2,000 and 1,000 horse. Mu\u1e25ammad Shafi\u2018\u0101, Bakhshi of Multan, had the title of Khan conferred on him. I gave leave to Shar\u012bf, Vakil of my fortunate son Sh\u0101h Parwiz, to go with all possible haste, and bring my son to wait on me with the army of Behar, and writing a gracious farman with my own hand I urged him to come.\n\nOn this day M\u012br M\u012br\u0101n, the grandson of Sh\u0101h Ni\u2018matu-llah, died suddenly. I hope that he will be among the pardoned.\n\nannouncing the fact and explaining his procedure was presented by Haidar Beg on 26 Ab\u0101n, 1031\u2014i.e., early in November, 1622. He brought the officers of the garrison with him. See \u2018\u0100lam-\u0101r\u0101\u2019\u012b and the T\u016bzuk text, 348 (annals of the 17th year).\nA raging elephant threw down the huntsman M\u012brz\u0101 Beg and killed him: I assigned his duties to Im\u0101m-wird\u012b.\n\nAs in consequence of the weakness that came over me two years ago and still continues, heart and brain do not accord. I cannot* make notes of events and occurrences. Now that Mu'tamid K. has come from the Deccan, and has had the good fortune to kiss the threshold, as he is a servant who knows my temperament and understands my words, and was also formerly entrusted with this duty, I gave an order that from the date which I have written he shall hereafter write them with his own hand, and attach them to my Memoranda. Whatever events may occur hereafter he should note after the manner of a diary, and submit them for my verification, and then they should be copied into a book.\n\nFrom this Place the Notes are Written by Mu'tamid Khan.\u2020\n\nAs the whole of my world-opening mind was taken up with the preparation of the Qandahar army, and the remedy for that business, the unpleasant news that reached me of a change in the condition of Khurr\u0101m, and his want of moderation, became a cause for aversion and dissension. I accordingly sent M\u016bsaw\u012b K., who is one of the sincere servants who knows my temperament, to that wretch (bi-daullat) to lay before him the threatening messages and my wishes, and to give admonitions that might sharpen his intelligence, so that by the guidance of good fortune he might awake from the dream of carelessness and pride, and that he (M\u016bsaw\u012b) having gained a (true) knowledge of his futile ideas and aims might hasten to my presence, and carry out whatever appeared to be necessary. On the 1st of the Divine month of Bahman the feast of my lunar weighing took place. At this auspicious ceremony Mah\u0101bat K., having come from Kabul, paid his respects, and was the recipient of special favours. I appointed\n\n* Elliot, VI. 280.\n\u2020 These words do not appear in the I.O. MSS. And what is written in this chapter about the fates of Khal\u012bl and Mu\u1e25tarim, etc., does not agree with Mu'tamid's writing in Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma.\nYa\u2018q\u016bb K. Badakhshi to Kabul, exalting him with the gift of drums. About this time report came from I\u2018tib\u0101r K. from Agra that Khurram, with the army of adversity, had left M\u0101nd\u016b and started in that direction. He had evidently heard the news that the treasure had been sent for, and fire had fallen into his mind, and having let fall from his hand the reins of self-control, had started (with the idea) that on the road he might lay hold of the treasure. Accordingly I thought it best to proceed for a tour, and in order to hunt to the bank of the river of Sul\u1e6d\u0101n-p\u016br (the Beas). If that wretch by the guidance of error should place his foot in the desert of audacity, I might hasten farther forward and place the punishment of his unbecoming behaviour in the skirt of his fortune. If matters turned out in any other way I might take steps accordingly. With this purpose, on the 17th of the same month, at an auspicious hour, I marched. Mah\u0101bat K. was dignified with a dress of honour. Rs. 1,00,000 were ordered to be given to M\u012brz\u0101 Rustam and Rs. 2,00,000 to \u2018Abdu-llah K. by way of advance of pay. I sent M\u012brz\u0101 Kh\u0101n, s. Zain K., with a gracious farman to my fortunate son Sh\u0101h Parwiz, and renewed my urgency for his attendance. R\u0101ja S\u0101rang Deo had gone to summon R\u0101ja Bir Singh Deo; he came, and having paid his respects, reported that the R\u0101ja, with a proper force and an equipped army, would join me at Thanesar. At this time constant reports* came from I\u2018tib\u0101r K. and other servants of the State from Agra that Khurram in revolt and disloyalty (b\u012b-daulat\u012b) had changed what was due by him for rearing into undutifulnesses,\u2020 and having placed the foot of ruin in the valley of ignorance and error, had started in that direction. They therefore did not consider it advisable to bring the treasure, and were engaged in strengthening the towers and gates, and providing things necessary for the defence of the fort. Similarly a report came from \u0100\u1e63af K. that the wretch had torn off the veil of respect, and turned his face towards the valley of ruin, and that the odour of good came not from the manner of his\n\n* Elliot, VI. 384.\n\u2020 \u1e24uq\u016bq ba-\u2018uq\u016bq, \u201crights into wrongs.\u201d\napproach. As it was not for the advantage of the State to bring the treasure, he had entrusted it to God, and was himself on the way to wait on me. Accordingly, having crossed the river at Sult\u0101np\u016br, by successive marches I proceeded to punish that one of dark fortune, and gave an order that henceforth they should call him B\u012b-daulat (wretch). Wherever in this record of fortune \u201cB\u012b-daulat\u201d is mentioned it will refer to him. From the kindnesses and favours bestowed upon him I can say that up till the present time no king has conferred such on his son. What my revered father did for my brothers I have done for his servants, giving them titles, standards, and drums, as has been recorded in the preceding pages. It will not be hidden from the readers of this record of prosperity what affection and interest I have bestowed on him. My pen\u2019s tongue fails in ability to set them forth. What shall I say of my own sufferings? In pain and weakness, in a warm atmosphere that is extremely unsuited to my health, I must still ride and be active, and in this state must proceed against such an undutiful son. Many servants cherished by me for long years and raised to the dignity of nobility, whom I ought to employ to-day in war against the Uzbeg or the Persian, I must punish* for his vileness and destroy with my own hand. Thank God that he has given me such capacity to bear my burdens that I can put up with all this, and go on in the same path, and reckon them as light. But that which weighs heavily on my heart, and places my eager temperament in sorrow is this, that at such a time when my prosperous sons and loyal officers should be vying with each other in the service against Qandahar and Khurasan, which would be to the renown of the Sultanate, this inauspicious one has struck with an axe the foot of his own dominion, and become a stumbling-block in the path of the enterprise. The momentous affair of Qandahar must now be postponed, but I trust that Almighty God will remove these griefs from my heart.\n\n* I rather think the meaning is \u201che by his baseness and illfatedness has capitally punished them, and has (as it were) slain them by his own hand,\u201d the meaning being that they will fall in the civil war about to take place.\nAt this time it was reported to me that Mu\u1e25tarim K., the eunuch, Khal\u012bl Beg Z\u016b-l-qadr, and Fid\u0101\u02bei K., the Master of the Ceremonies, had allied themselves with B\u012b-daulat, and opened the gates of correspondence with him. As it was no time for mildness and winking at matters, I imprisoned all three, and as, after making inquiry into the circumstances, no doubt remained as to their falseness to their salt, and about the evil designs and malevolence of Khal\u012bl and Mu\u1e25tarim, and as Amirs like M\u012brz\u0101 Rustam swore to the insincerity and malevolence of Khal\u012bl, having no remedy I punished them* capitally. Fid\u0101\u02bei K., the dust of whose sincerity was free of suspicion and pure, I brought out of confinement and promoted. I sent R\u0101ja R\u016bz-afz\u016bn by post (d\u0101k-chauk\u012b) to my son Sh\u0101h Parwiz that he might bring him with all haste to wait on me; so that B\u012b-daulat might be brought to punishment for his improper conduct. Jaw\u0101hir K., the eunuch, was appointed to the post of Ihtim\u0101m-i-darb\u0101r-i-mahall (superintendent of the harem).\n\nOn the 1st of Isfand\u0101rm\u016bz the royal army arrived at N\u016brsar\u0101y. On this day a report came from I\u02bftib\u0101r K., that B\u012b-daulat had arrived in all haste in the neighbourhood of Agra, in the hope that before the fort was strengthened, the gates of strife and mischief might be opened, and he might attain his end. When he arrived at Fat\u1e25p\u016br, he found the gates closed against him, and, being struck with the disgrace of ruin, he had halted. The Kh\u0101n-kh\u0101n\u0101n and his son and many of the royal Amirs attached to the Deccan and Gujarat had come with him as companions on the road of rebellion and ingratitude. M\u016bsaw\u012b K. saw him at Fat\u1e25p\u016br, and showed him the royal orders, and it was settled that he should send his servant Q\u0101\u1e93\u012b \u2018Abdu-l-\u2018Az\u012bz with him to Court to put his requests before me. He sent to Agra his servant Sundar,\u2020 who was the ringleader of the people of error and the chief of the seditious, to take possession of the treasures and hidden wealth of those servants of the State who were at Agra. Amongst\u2021\n\n* Compare Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 199.\n\u2020 This is the man whom Jahangir had made R\u0101ja Bikram\u0101j\u012bt.\n\u2021 Elliot, VI. 385.\nothers he entered the house of Lashkar K., and seized Rs. 9,00,000. In the same manner, wherever he suspected there was property in the houses of other servants (of the Court), he stretched out his hand to seize it, and took possession of all that he found. When nobles like Kh\u0101n-kh\u0101n\u0101n, who had been distinguished with the rank of \u0100t\u0101l\u012bk and arrived at the age of seventy years, made their faces black with rebellion and ingratitude, how could one complain of others? It may be said that his very nature was seditious and ungrateful. His father (Bair\u0101m K.) at the end of his life behaved in the same unbecoming way towards my reverend father. He, following the example of his father, at his age made himself accursed and rejected to all eternity.\n\nIn the end a wolf\u2019s cub becomes a wolf\nAlthough he grow up with man. (Sa\u2019d\u012b.)\n\nOn this day M\u016bsaw\u012b K. arrived with \u2018Abdu-l-\u2018Az\u012bz, the envoy of B\u012b-daulat. As his requests were unreasonable, I did not allow him to speak, but handed him over to Mah\u0101bat to be kept in prison. On the 5th of the month I pitched on the bank of the river of L\u016bdiy\u0101na (the Sutlej). I promoted Kh\u0101n A\u02bf\u1e93am to the mansab of 7,000 with 5,000 horse. R\u0101ja Bharat, the Bandila, from the Deccan, and Day\u0101nat K. from Agra, came and waited on me. I pardoned the offences of Day\u0101nat K., and gave him the same mansab that he had previously held. R\u0101j\u0101 Bharat was raised to the mansab of 1,500 and 1,000 horse, and M\u016bsaw\u012b K. to that of 1,000 and 300 horse. On Thursday, the 12th, in the pargana of Th\u0101nesar, R\u0101ja Bir Singh Deo, having waited on me, reviewed his army and elicited great praise. R\u0101ja S\u0101rang Deo was promoted to the mansab of 1,500 with 600 horse. In Karn\u0101l \u0100saf K., coming from Agra, lifted up the head of honour in kissing my stirrup. His coming at this time was the herald of victory. Naw\u0101zish K., s. Sa\u02bf\u012bd K., having arrived from Gujarat, paid his respects. When B\u012b-daulat was at Burhanpur, at his request I had appointed B\u0101q\u012b K. to J\u016bn\u0101gadh. He had been ordered to come to Court, and now came and shared in my service. As my march from Lahore took place without\nprevious notice, and time did not admit of delay or reflection, I came with the few Amirs who were in attendance. Until I arrived at Sihrind only a few men had the good fortune to accompany me, but after passing beyond it, great numbers of the army came in from all sides and quarters. Before arrival at Delhi such a force had come together that in any direction in which one looked the whole plain was occupied by troops.\n\nAs it was reported that B\u012b-daulat had left Fathp\u016br and was coming in this direction, and making continuous marches towards Delhi, I gave the victorious army orders to put on their chiltas (quilted coats). In this disturbance the pivot of the management of affairs and the arrangement of the army were entrusted to Mah\u0101bat K. The command of the vanguard was given to \u2018Abdu-llah K. Of the selected young men and experienced sip\u0101h\u012bs, whoever was asked for by him was enrolled in his corps. I ordered him to march a koss ahead of the other forces. He was also entrusted with the intelligence department and the control of the routes. I was ignorant of the fact that he was in league with B\u012b-daulat, and that the real object of that evil-natured one was to send news from my army to him. Previously to this he used to bring long written slips of true and false news, saying that his spies had sent them from that place. The purport was that they (the spies) suspected some of my servants of being in league with B\u012b-daulat, and of sending him news. Had I been led away by his intrigues and become alarmed at this time when the wind of disturbance was blowing strongly I would have been obliged to destroy many of my servants. Although some faithful servants suspected his evil intentions and untruthfulness, the time was not one for removing the veil openly from the face of his deeds. I guarded my eye and tongue from doing anything which might carry terror into his evil mind, and showed him more attention and favour than before, with the idea that possibly he would be struck with shame, and might turn away from his evil deeds, and give up his evil nature and sedition. That rejected one to all eternity, in whom a tendency to vileness and falsity was natural, did\nnot fail to do what was in accordance with himself, as will be related hereafter.\n\nThe tree* that is bitter in its nature\nIf you plant it in the garden of Paradise,\nAnd water it from the eternal stream thereof,\nIf you pour on its root pure honey,\nIn the end it shows its natural quality,\nAnd it bears the same bitter fruit.\n\nIn fine, when I was near Delhi, Sayyid Bahwa Bukh\u0101r\u012b, \u1e62adr K., and R\u0101ja Kishan D\u0101s came out of the city, and had the good fortune to kiss my stirrup. B\u0101qir K., faujdar of Oudh, also on this day came to the victorious camp. On the 25th of the month, passing by Delhi, I pitched my camp on the bank of the Jumna. Girdhar, s. R\u0101y S\u0101l Darb\u0101r\u012b, having come from the Deccan, had the honour to pay his respects. He was promoted to the mansab of 2,000 and 1,500 horse, and obtained the title of Raja, and was clothed in a dress of honour. Zabar-dast K., Master of the Ceremonies, was honoured with a standard.\n\n* The lines come from Fird\u016bs\u012b\u2019s satire on Ma\u1e25m\u016bd of Ghazni.\nTHE EIGHTEENTH\nNEW YEAR'S FEAST AFTER THE\nAUSPICIOUS ACCESSION\n\nOn the eve of Tuesday, the 20th of Jum\u0101d\u0101-l-awwal, A.H. 1032 (March 10, 1623), the sun that lights the world entered his house of honour in Aries, and the eighteenth year from the beginning of my reign commenced auspiciously and happily. On this day I heard that B\u012b-daulat, having gone to the neighbourhood of Mathura, had encamped the army tainted with ruin in the pargana of Sh\u0101hp\u016br, and reviewed 27,000 cavalry. It is hoped that they will soon be subdued and miserable. R\u0101ja Jay Singh, grandson* of R\u0101ja M\u0101n Singh, came from his native country, and had the good fortune to kiss my stirrup. I dignified R\u0101ja Bir Singh Deo, than whom in the Rajput caste there is no greater Amir, with the title of Maharaja, and promoted his son Jograj to the mansab of 2,000 with 1,000 horse. Sayyid Bahwa was presented with an elephant. As it was reported to me that B\u012b-daulat was coming by the bank of the Jumna, the march of the victorious army in that direction was also decided on. The array of the army that resembled the waves of the sea was divided into the van, the right and left wings, the altmish, the tarah (reserve), the chand\u0101wul (rear), etc., and arranged in a manner suitable to the circumstances and according to the locality. Close upon this came the news that B\u012b-daulat, with the wretch Kh\u0101n-kh\u0101n\u0101n, had turned his reins from the right road and gone towards the pargana Kotila, 20 koss towards the left, along with the brahman Sundar, who was his guide to the desert of\n\n* He was the great-grandson, being the son of Mah\u0101 Singh s. Jagat Singh s. M\u0101n Singh.\nerror, with D\u0101r\u0101b, s. Kh\u0101n-kh\u0101n\u0101n, and many of the Amirs who had accompanied him on the road of rebellion and rascality, such as Himmat K., Sar-buland K., Sharza K. \u2018\u0100bid K., J\u0101do R\u0101y, \u016aday R\u0101m, \u0100tash K., Mans\u016br K., and other mansabdars, who were attached to the Deccan, Gujarat, and Malwa, the recital of whom would take too long, and all his own servants, such as R\u0101ja Bh\u012bm, s. R\u0101n\u0101, Rustam K., Bairam Beg, the Afghan Dary\u0101, Taq\u012b, and others whom he had left to confront the royal army. There were five* armies (corps ?). Although nominally the command was in the hands of the wretch (bar-gashta-i-r\u016bzg\u0101r) D\u0101r\u0101b, yet in reality the leader and centre of the whole affair was Sundar, of evil deeds. These men of darkened fortune pitched in the neighbourhood of Bal\u016bchp\u016br to their ruin. On the 8th I pitched at Qab\u016blp\u016br. On this day the turn to take the rear fell upon B\u0101q\u012br K. We had left him behind all the rest. A body of the rebels attacked him on the march, and stretched out the hand of plunder. B\u0101q\u012br planted firmly the foot of courage, and succeeded in beating them back. Khw\u0101j\u0101 Ab\u016b-l-\u1e24asan got news of this, and turned his reins to support him. Before the arrival of the Khw\u0101j\u0101 the rebels (mard\u016bd\u0101n), not being able to stand, had taken to flight. On Wednesday, the 9th of the month, having separated 25,000 horse under the leadership of \u0100\u1e63af K., Khw\u0101j\u0101 Ab\u016b-l-\u1e24asan, and \u2018Abdu-llah K., I sent them to attack the rebels who did not look to the end of things. Q\u0101sim K., Lashkar K., Ir\u0101dat K., Fid\u0101\u2019i K., and other servants, to the number of 8,000 horse, were appointed to \u0100\u1e63af K.\u2019s force. B\u0101q\u012br K., N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn Quli, Ibr\u0101h\u012bm \u1e24usain K\u0101shgh\u0101r\u012b, and others, to the number of 8,000 horse, were appointed to support Ab\u016b-l-\u1e24asan. Naw\u0101zish K., \u2018Abdu-l-\u2018Az\u012bz K., \u2018Az\u012bzu-llah, and many of the B\u0101rha and Amroha Sayyids, were ordered to accompany \u2018Abdu-llah. In this army 10,000 horse were enrolled. Sundar had arranged the army of ruin and put forward the foot of shamelessness. At this time I sent my special quiver\n\n* Panj fauj. But perhaps the word is binj, or bikh, \u201croot.\u201d Or it may be pichh\u0101 fauj, \u201cthe hinder army.\u201d Apparently the reference is to the arrangement of the royal army into five divisions.\nby Zabar-dast K., Master of Ceremonies, to \u2018Abdu-llah K., that it might be the means of animating his zeal. When the encounter of the two sides took place, that black-faced one to all eternity, in whom the tendency to rebellion and ingratitude was innate, taking to flight, joined the rebels. \u2018Abdu-l-\u2018Az\u012bz K., the son of the Kh\u0101n Daur\u0101n, God knows whether knowingly or not, went off with him. Naw\u0101zish K., Zabar-dast K., and Sh\u012br-hamla, who were in the corps of that shameless one (\u2018Abdu-llah K.), planted firmly the foot of courage, and were not disturbed at his going. As the aid of Almighty God is ever near this suppliant, at this crisis, when a leader of the army such as \u2018Adbu-llah K. threw 10,000 cavalry into confusion and joined the enemy, and there was nearly a great disaster, a shot from a mysterious hand reached Sundar. At his fall the pillars of the courage of the rebels shook. Khw\u0101ja Ab\u016b-l-Hasan also drove before him the army in front of him and defeated it. \u0100\u1e63af K., when B\u0101qir K. arrived, showing great activity, finished the affair, and a victory which might be the \u1e6du\u011fhr\u0101 (sign manual) of the victories of the age showed its face of purpose from the hidden world. Zabar-dast K., Sh\u012br-hamla, Sh\u012br-bacha, his son, and the son of Asad K., the architect, and Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24usain, brother of Khw\u0101ja Jah\u0101n, and a number of the Sayyids of B\u0101rha who were in the corps of the black-faced \u2018Abdu-llah, having tasted the sweet-flavoured wine of martyrdom, obtained everlasting life. \u2018Az\u012bzu-llah, grandson of \u1e24usain K. (Tukriya), being wounded by a gun-shot, got off safely. Although at this time the desertion of that rejected hypocrite was a secret help, yet it is probable that if he had not performed this detestable action in the crisis of the battle, many of the rebel leaders would have been killed or captured. It chanced that he was known to the common people by the title of La\u2018natu-llah (God\u2019s curse), and as he had received this name from the hidden world I also called him by it. Hereafter, wherever the expression La\u2018natu-llah is used it refers to him. Briefly, after the rebels, whose end was evil, took to flight from the field of battle, and turned their faces towards the valley of ruin and could not reassemble, La\u2018natu-llah, with all the rebels, did not\nturn his rein till he reached B\u012b-daulat, who was at a distance of 20 koss.\n\nWhen the news of the victory of the servants of the State reached this suppliant to God, he prostrated himself in thankfulness for this gift, which was from the renewed favour of Allah, and summoned the loyal ones into his presence. On the next day they brought before me the head of Sundar. It appeared that when the ball struck him he gave up his soul to the lords of hell, and they took his body to a neighbouring village to be burnt. When they were about to light the fire, an army appeared in the distance, and for fear lest they should be taken prisoners, everyone took to flight. The Muqaddam (head man) of the village cut off his head, and for his own acquittal took it to Kh\u0101n A\u02bf\u1e93am, as it occurred in his jagir. He was brought to me (with the head): the head was quite recognizable and had as yet undergone no change, but they had cut off the ears for the sake of the pearls in them. No one knew by whose hand he had been shot. In consequence of his destruction, B\u012b-daulat did not gird his loins again. One might say his good fortune and courage and understanding lay in that dog of a Hindu. When, with a father like me, who in truth am his ostensible creator, and in my own lifetime have raised him to the great dignity of Sultanship, and denied him nothing, he acts in this manner, I appeal to the justice of Allah that He may never again regard him with favour. Those servants who in this disturbance had done fitting service were honoured with more and more favours, each according to his degree. Khw\u0101ja Ab\u016b-l-\u1e24asan was raised to the mansab of 5,000, original and increased, Naw\u0101zish K. to that of 4,000 and 3,000 horse, B\u0101qir K. to that of 3,000 and 500 horse, with drums, Ibr\u0101h\u012bm \u1e24usain K\u0101shghar\u012b to that of 2,000 and 1,000 horse, \u2018Az\u012bzu-llah to that of 2,000 and 1,000 horse, N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn Qul\u012b to that of 2,000 and 700 horse, R\u0101ja R\u0101m D\u0101s to that of 2,000 and 1,000 horse, Lutfu-llah to that of 1,000 and 500 horse, Parwar\u012bsh K. to that of 1,000 and 500 horse. If all the servants were to be written in detail it would take too long. Briefly I remained at that place one day and marched on the next. Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam, having marched\nfrom Allahabad, had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. On the 12th of the month I encamped at the village of Jh\u0101nsa (?).\n\nOn this day Sar-buland R\u0101y came from the Deccan and waited on me, and was honoured with a special jewelled dagger, with a ph\u016bl kat\u0101ra. \u2018Abdu-l-\u2018Az\u012bz K. and some of those who had gone with La\u2018natu-llah released themselves from the hand of B\u012b-daulat, and paid their respects, and represented that when La\u2018natu-llah charged, they thought it was for a cavalry encounter. When they found themselves in the midst of the rebels they saw nothing for it but to submit and pay their respects, but now they had found an opportunity and had obtained the good fortune of kissing the threshold. Though they had taken 2,000 muhrs from B\u012b-daulat for their expenses, as the times were critical I made no inquiry, but accepted* their statement.\n\nOn the 19th the Feast of the culmination was held, and many of the servants of the State were raised in mansab, and had suitable favours conferred on them.\n\nMir \u2018A\u1e93udu-d-daulah, having come from Agra, waited on me. He brought a vocabulary\u2020 of words that he had prepared. In truth he had taken much pains, and collected together all the words from the writings of ancient poets. There is no book like this in the science.\n\nR\u0101ja Jay Singh was raised to the mansab of 3,000 with 1,400 horse, and a special elephant was presented to my son Shahriy\u0101r. The post of \u2018Arz-mukarrir (examiner of petitions) was conferred on M\u016bsaw\u012b K. Am\u0101nu-llah, s. Mah\u0101bat K., was given the title of Kh\u0101n-z\u0101d Kh\u0101n, was favoured with a mansab of 4,000 personal and horse, and was honoured with a flag and drums.\n\nOn the 1st of the Divine month of Urdibihisht I pitched on the bank of the lake at Fat\u1e25p\u016br. I\u2019tib\u0101r K. came from Agra and waited on me, and was graciously received. Mu\u1e93affar K., Mukarram K., and his brother also came from Agra, and had the good fortune to wait on me. As I\u2019tib\u0101r K. had done\n\n* \u201cBought it as if it were genuine.\u201d\n\u2020 The Farhang-i-Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b, Rieu Cat., p. 496 b.\napproved service in the charge of the Agra fort he was dignified with the title of Mumt\u0101z K., and I gave him the mansab of 6,000 personal and 5,000 horse, and having bestowed on him a dress of honour, a jewelled sword, a horse, and a special elephant, I sent him back to his duty. Sayyid Bahwa was promoted to the mansab of 2,000 and 1,500 horse, Mukarram K. to that of 3,000 and 2,000 horse, and Khw\u0101ja Q\u0101sim to that of 1,000 with 400 horse. On the 4th Man\u1e63\u016br K. Farang\u012b, whose circumstances have been recorded* in the proceeding pages (?), with his brother\u2020 and Naubat\u2021 K. Dakhan\u012b, by the guidance of good fortune separated themselves from B\u012b-daulat, and came into my service. I sent Khaw\u0101s K. to my fortunate son Sh\u0101h Parw\u012bz. M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018\u012as\u0101 Tarkh\u0101n, having come from Multan, had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. A special sword was given to Mah\u0101bat K. On the 10th the camp was pitched in the pargana of Hindaun. Man\u1e63\u016br K. (the Farang\u012b) was raised to the mansab of 4,000 personal and 3,000 horse, and that of Naubat\u00a7 K. to that of 2,000 and 1,000 horse. On the 11th was a halt. As on this day a meeting with my fortunate son Sh\u0101h Parw\u012bz had been arranged, I ordered that the powerful princes and the illustrious Amirs and all the devoted servants should go out to meet him, and bring him to wait on me in a fitting manner. After midday had passed, at an auspicious chosen hour he kissed the ground and illuminated the forehead of his sincerity. After the usual salutations had been performed and the customary ceremonies gone through I embraced my fortunate son with the greatest pleasure and affection, and loaded him with more and more favours. At this time news came that B\u012b-daulat, when he was passing through the township (\u1e25aw\u0101l\u012b) of the pargana of Amber, which was the hereditary abode of R\u0101ja M\u0101n Singh, had sent a band of scoundrels and plundered that cultivated spot.\n\n* Where is this account? He is mentioned later, p. 359 of text. Perhaps he is the Armenian mentioned in the 15th year as Z\u016b-l-Qarnain. But an Armenian would hardly be called a Farang\u012b.\n\n\u2020 The MSS. have \u201chis brother Maghr\u016br.\u201d\n\n\u2021 The MSS. have a name that is not Naubat, and perhaps is Y\u016bnas or Y\u016bnash Kh\u0101n.\n\n\u00a7 Y\u016bnas or Y\u016bnash in MSS.\nOn the 12th I pitched outside the village of S\u0101rw\u0101l\u012b. I had previously sent \u1e24abash K. (Abyssinian) to repair the buildings at Ajmir. I promoted my fortunate son Sh\u0101h Parwiz to the high mansab of 40,000 and 30,000 horse. As it was reported that B\u012b-daulat had sent off Jagat Singh, s. R\u0101ja B\u0101so, to his own country to raise disturbances in the hills of the Panjab, I promoted \u0160\u0101diq K., chief Bakhshi, to the governorship of that province, and ordered him to punish him, giving him a dress of honour, with a sword and an elephant, and making up his mansab, original and increased, to 4,000 personal and 3,000 horse. I also honoured him with a standard (t\u016bgh) and drums.\n\nAt this time it was reported to me that the younger brothers of M\u012brz\u0101 Bad\u012b\u2018u-z-zam\u0101n, s. M\u012brz\u0101 Sh\u0101hr\u016bkh, who was known as Fathp\u016br\u012b, had attacked him unawares and killed him. About this time his brothers came to Court and paid their respects. His own mother also waited on me, but did not make a claim, as was proper, for her son\u2019s blood, and (so) proceedings* could not be taken according to law. Although his disposition was so bad that his murder was not to be regretted, but on the contrary was opportune and advantageous, yet, as these wretches had shown such audacity with regard to their elder brother, who was to them in the position of a father, I ordered them to be put in gaol, and afterwards what was deemed proper should be done to them. On the 21st R\u0101ja Gaj Singh and R\u0101y S\u016braj Singh arrived from their jagirs, and had the good fortune to kiss my stirrup. Mu\u2019izzu-l-mulk, whom I had sent to Multan to summon my son Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n, came and waited on me, and presented me with a letter about his severe illness and weakness. He had sent his son A\u1e63\u0101lat K. with 1,000 horse to wait on me, and expressed great regret at being deprived of the honour of meeting me. As his apology was evidently sincere, I accepted it. On the 25th my fortunate son Prince Parwiz, with the victorious army, was sent in\n\n* Perhaps it means that qi\u1e63\u0101\u1e63 or retaliation could not be inflicted. See Ma\u2019\u0101\u1e63iru-l-unar\u0101, III. 335, and Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 204. Evidently the mother did not want to prosecute. It is probable that his murderers were only his half-brothers.\npursuit to overthrow B\u012b-daulat. The reins of authority over the powerful Prince, and the centre of the ordering of the victorious army, were given into the hand of Mu'taminu-d-daula Mah\u0101bat K. Of the illustrious Am\u012brs and life-sacrificing brave men who were in attendance on the Prince of lofty fortune, this is the detail.\n\nKh\u0101n '\u0100lam, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja* Gaj Singh, F\u0101\u017cil K., Rash\u012bd K., R\u0101ja Girdhar, R\u0101ja R\u0101m D\u0101s Kachhw\u0101ha, Khw\u0101ja Mir 'Abdu-l-'Az\u012bz, 'Az\u012bzu-llah, Asad K., Parwarish K., Ikram K., Sayyid Hizbar K., Lu\u1e6dfu-llah, R\u0101y Nar\u0101yan D\u0101s, and others to the number of 40,000 horse, with much artillery. Rs. 2,000,000 (twenty lakhs) of treasure were sent with them. At a propitious hour they were started with my scn, and bridle to bridle with victory. F\u0101\u017cil K. was appointed Bakhshi and newswriter to the victorious army. A special dress of honour was bestowed on the Prince, with a n\u0101dir\u012b of gold brocade, and pearls on the collar and skirt worth Rs. 41,000, prepared in the royal establishment, and a private elephant of the name Ratan Gaj, ten\u2020 female elephants, a private horse, and a jewelled sword, the value of the whole of which was Rs. 77,000. These were all given to the Prince. N\u016br Jah\u0101n Begam also gave him a dress of honour, a horse, and an elephant, as is the custom. To Mah\u0101bat K. and the other Amirs, according to their standing, horses, elephants, and dresses of honour were presented. The immediate attendants of the prince were also honoured with favours. On this day Mu\u1e93affar K. received a dress of honour on appointment to the post of chief Bakhshi. On the first of the Divine month of Khurd\u0101d Prince D\u0101war-bakhsh, s. Khusrau, was appointed to Gujarat, and Kh\u0101n A'\u1e93am to the high dignity of tutor to him. I conferred on the prince a horse, an elephant, a dress of honour, a private jewelled dagger, a standard (t\u016bgh), and drums. Kh\u0101n A'\u1e93am, Naw\u0101z\u012bsh K. and other servants were honoured with presents according to their standing. Ir\u0101dat K. was appointed Bakhshi in place of F\u0101\u017cil K. Ruknu-s-saltana\n\n* The MSS. have Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Gaj Singh, and they also have the names Mans\u016br Kh\u0101n, Sar-buland R\u0101y and Lashkar K.\n\u2020 \"Two\" in MSS.\n\u0100\u1e63af K. exalted his head with the dignity of the Subadarship of Bengal and Orissa. A special dress of honour, with a jewelled sword, were conferred on him. Ab\u016b \u1e6c\u0101lib (i.e., Shaista K.), his son, was appointed to accompany him, and promoted to the mansab of 2,000 with 1,000 horse. On Saturday, the 9th, corresponding with the 19th Rajab; A.H. 1032 (May 9, 1623), the camp was pitched at the An\u0101-S\u0101gar lake outside Ajmir. Prince D\u0101war-bakhsh, being honoured with the mansab of 8,000, and 3,000 horse, was granted Rs. 2,00,000 of treasure for the expenses of the army which accompanied him. Rs. 1,00,000 I also gave as an advance to Kh\u0101n A\u02bf\u1e93am. Allah-y\u0101r, s. Iftikh\u0101r Beg, who was in the service of my fortunate son Sh\u0101h Parw\u012bz, was at his request granted a standard. T\u0101t\u0101r K. took leave on his appointment to the charge of Fort Gwalior. R\u0101ja Gaj Singh was appointed to the mansab of 5,000, with 4,000 horse.\n\nOn this day news came from Agra that Her Highness (\u1e25a\u1e93rat) Maryamu-z-zam\u0101n\u012b,* by the decree of God, had died. I trust that Almighty God will envelop her in the ocean of His mercy. Jagat Singh, s. R\u0101n\u0101 Karan, having come from his native place, had the good fortune to pay his respects. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm K. Fath-jang, governor of Bengal, had sent thirty-four elephants by way of offering, and they were submitted to me. B\u0101qir K. was appointed faujdar of Oudh, and S\u0101d\u0101t K. to the D\u016b-\u0101b. The M\u012br Mushrif was made Diw\u0101n-i-buy\u016bt\u0101t.\n\nOn the 12th of the Divine month of T\u012br a report came from the officials of Gujarat with the good news of victory and conquest. The particulars of this summary are that I had granted the Subah of Gujarat, the abode of Sultans of high dignity, to B\u012b-daulat as a reward for his victory over the R\u0101n\u0101, as has been fully related in the preceding pages. Sundar, the brahman, administered and protected the country. When futile ideas entered his ungrateful mind, he sent for that dog of a Hindu, who was always shaking the chain of enmity and perversity, along with Himmat K., Sharza K., Sar-afr\u0101z K., and many of the royal servants who were fieffholders in the province. Sundar\u2019s brother Kunhar was appointed in his room.\n\n* Jahangir\u2019s mother.\nWhen Sundar was killed, and Bi-daulat retreated after his defeat to M\u0101nd\u016b, the province of Gujarat was put in the charge of La\u2018natu-llah as his fief, and Kunhar was sent for along with \u1e62af\u012b K., the diwan. At the same time the treasure, the jewelled throne on which five lakhs had been expended, and the pardala (belt) on which two lakhs had been spent\u2014and which things had been prepared as a present for myself\u2014were also sent for. \u1e62af\u012b K. was the brother\u2019s son (text says \u201cbrother\u201d) of Ja\u2018far Beg, who received in my father\u2019s service the title of \u0100\u1e63af K., and was married to a daughter of N\u016br Jah\u0101n\u2019s brother, who by my favour had received the title of \u0100\u1e63af K. An elder daughter was the wife of Bi-daulat. Both daughters were by one mother, and Bi-daulat expected that on account of this connection \u1e62af\u012b K. would be on his side. But an eternal decree had gone forth for \u1e62af\u012b K.\u2019s loyalty and prosperity, and that he should attain to high rank! Accordingly, Almighty God made him loyal and the performer of good deeds, as will now be described. In short, the faithless (b\u012b-waf\u0101) La\u2018natu-llah sent his eunuch named Waf\u0101-d\u0101r to be governor of that country, and he, with a few ragamuffins (b\u012b-sar-u-p\u0101) entered Ahmadabad, and took possession of the city. As \u1e62af\u012b K. had made up his mind to be loyal, he courageously looked after the servants, and collected a force, and won the hearts of the people. Some days before Kunhar came out of the city he (\u1e62af\u012b) encamped on the bank of the Kankariy\u0101 lake, and thence hastened to Mahm\u016bd\u0101b\u0101d, giving out openly that he was going to Bi-daulat. Secretly, he opened communication and made arrangements to be loyal with N\u0101hir K., Sayyid Dil\u012br K., N\u0101n\u016b* K., Afghan, and other devoted servants of the State, who were waiting in their own jagirs. He awaited his opportunity. S\u0101lih, a servant of Bi-daulat, who was faujdar of the Sarkar of Pitl\u0101d, and had a good force with him, heard rumours that \u1e62af\u012b K. entertained other ideas. Kunhar\u2020 had also discovered this, but as \u1e62af\u012b K. soothed them and was very cautious and careful in his conduct,\n\n* MS. 181 has B\u0101b\u0101 Kh\u0101n.\n\u2020 MS. 181 has Kuhnar or Kunhar, and it seems that it is a name, and not merely \u201cyounger brother.\u201d The Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 205, has Kunhar D\u0101s.\nthey could not move hand or foot. \u1e62\u0101li\u1e25, for fear lest \u1e62afi K., abandoning dissimulation, should stretch his hand towards the treasure, exercised foresight, and went farther on with the treasure, taking nearly Rs. 10,00,000 to B\u012b-daulat at M\u0101nd\u016b. Kunhar (or the younger brother?) also, having seized the jewelled pardala, started after him, but could not take the throne on account of its weight. \u1e62afi K., knowing this was his opportunity, changed his place from Mahm\u016bd\u0101b\u0101d to the pargana of Karang,* which is to the left of the usual road, where N\u0101n\u016b K. was, and arranged by letter and verbal messages with N\u0101hir K. and other loyal servants that each of them should ride from his jagir with the force that he had, and at the hour of sunrise, which was the morning of prosperity for people of good fortune, and the evening of ruin to those who practised villainy, enter the city by the gate to which each was opposite. He (\u1e62afi) left his women in the aforesaid pargana, and, in company with N\u0101n\u016b (B\u0101b\u016b?) K., came at dawn to the outskirts of the city. He halted for a short time in the Sha\u02bfb\u0101n\u2020 garden until it had become light and friend could be distinguished from enemy. After the world-illuminating sun of good fortune (had risen), when he found the gate of prosperity open, though he could see no trace of N\u0101hir K. and the other loyalists, yet lest possibly the enemy might obtain information and fasten the gates of the fort, he placed his confidence in God who gives victory, and entered the city by the S\u0101rangp\u016br gate. About this time N\u0101hir K. also arrived, and, entering by the gate, came into the city. The eunuch of La\u02bfnatu-llah, having ascertained the unfailing good fortune of (Jahangir), took refuge in the house of Shaikh \u1e24aidar, grandson of Ni\u1e93\u0101m Wajihu-d-d\u012bn. The royal servants\n\n* Karij in text. See Jarrett, II. 253. But perhaps it should be Kaira.\n\n\u2020 It is Sha\u02bfb\u0101n in Nos. 181 and 305. The famous garden of Ahmadabad is the Sh\u0101h\u012b, for which see the Bombay Gazetteer, vol. for Ahmadabad, p. 283. But besides being Sha\u02bfb\u0101n in the MSS. it is also Sha\u02bfb\u0101n in the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 207. The Sh\u0101h\u012b garden lies to the north of Ahmadabad, and Safi was at the south or south-east of the city. Perhaps the Sha\u02bfb\u0101n garden was near the Malik Sha\u02bfb\u0101n lake, which was east of the city, and is referred to in Bombay Gazetteer, p. 18. The B\u0101gh Sha\u02bfb\u0101n is also referred to in Bayley\u2019s Gujarat, 236.\nof approved service, having proclaimed their victory with loud voices, set to work to strengthen the towers and gates. They sent men to the houses of Mu\u1e25ammad Taq\u012b, B\u012b-daulat\u2019s diwan, and of Hasan Beg, his Bakhshi, and seized them. Shaikh Haidar himself came and informed Saf\u012b K. that the eunuch of La\u2018natu-llah was in his house, and they tied his hands to his neck, and brought him. Having imprisoned a number of B\u012b-daulat\u2019s servants and dependants, they engaged in keeping order in the city. The jewelled throne, the cash of Rs. 2,00,000, and the property and effects of B\u012b-daulat and his men in the city, came into their possession. When this news reached B\u012b-daulat, he sent off La\u2018natu-llah with Himmat K., Sharza K., Sar-afr\u0101z K., Q\u0101bil Beg, Rustam Bah\u0101dur, \u0160\u0101lih Badakhsh\u012b, and other criminals. What with royal servants and his own men, he had some 5,000 or 6,000 horse. Saf\u012b K. and N\u0101hir K., becoming aware of this, planted firmly the foot of courage, and employed themselves in encouraging their men and collecting forces. Whatever cash and valuables they could obtain, even to the throne, which they broke up, they divided amongst both the old and new troopers as pay. R\u0101ja Kaly\u0101n, Zamindar of \u012adar (printed wrongly \u201cAnd\u016br\u201d), and the son of L\u0101l Gopi (?)*, and all the Zamindars from every quarter, were summoned into the city. A good number was thus assembled. La\u2018natu-llah did not wait for auxiliaries, and in the space of eight days came from M\u0101nd\u016b to Baroda. The loyal party, by the guidance of their courage, and in reliance on God, came out of the city and encamped on the bank of the K\u0101nkariy\u0101 Lake. It occurred to La\u2018natu-llah that if he came on quickly, the rope of order of the loyal might be broken. When he obtained news of the coming out of the loyal servants, drawing in the reins of ruin, he delayed in Baroda till the arrival of help. After the evil-ending criminals collected together at that chief place of mischief, he put forward the foot of error and deviation from the right path, and the loyal party, marching from the K\u0101nkariy\u0101 tank, encamped outside the village of Batoh, near the mausoleum of\n\n* Name very doubtful. MSS. seem to have Pir L\u0101l Koli, or it may be B\u012br L\u0101l\nQutb '\u0100lam. La'natu-llah traversed a road of three days in two,* and arrived at Ma\u1e25m\u016bd\u0101b\u0101d. As Sayyid Dil\u012br K. had seized the women of Sharza K. and brought them from Baroda to the city, \u1e62af\u012b K. sent a secret message to both of them that if by the guidance of good fortune they would rub off the stain of sin (rebellion) from the tablet of their foreheads, and would enrol themselves among the loyal servants, their position in the present and future worlds would approach salvation; otherwise he would subject their wives and children to all kinds of indignities. Hearing this, La'natu-llah sent for Sar-afr\u0101z K. on some excuse to his house, and imprisoned him. As Sharza K., Himmat K., and \u1e62\u0101li\u1e25 Bad\u0101khshi were in league together, and had alighted at the same place, he could not get Sharza K. into his hands. Briefly, on the 21st of Sha'b\u0101n, A.H. 1032, June 10, 1623, La'natu-llah mounted and arrayed the forces tinged with calamity. Those who were loyal also arrayed their forces and prepared for the fight. It occurred to La'natu-llah that if he were to go, their foot of courage would not stand firm, and, without a battle taking place, they would be dispersed in a miserable condition. When he saw the firm attitude of the loyal, he could not screw up his courage (t\u0101b nay\u0101warda), but turned his rein towards the left, and gave out that they had hidden gunpowder under the ground of that plain, and that his men would be destroyed by it\u2014that it would therefore be better to go into the plain of Sarkhej and deliver battle there. These futile ideas were due to the aid of good fortune, for on the turning back of his rein a rumour of his defeat was spread abroad, and the horsemen of the plain of victory attacked him in flank, and that ill-omened one was unable to reach Sarkhej, and halted in the village of N\u0101ranja. The loyal party arranged their forces in the village of B\u0101l\u016bd, which is nearly three koss off. At dawn on the next day they went to battle after the approved manner, their forces being drawn up in this way. In the vanguard were N\u0101hir K., R\u0101ja Kaly\u0101n, the Zamindar of \u012adar, and other valiant men; on the left wing Sayyid Dil\u012br K., Sayyid S\u012bd\u016b,\n\n* The MSS. have \"in ten.\"\nand other loyal servants were stationed; and on the right wing N\u0101n\u016b K., Sayyid Ya\u2018q\u016bb, Sayyid Ghul\u0101m Mu\u1e25ammad, and the rest of the life-sacrificing devoted ones, whilst in the centre were \u1e62af\u012b K., Kif\u0101yat K. Bakhsh\u012b, and some other servants of approved service. It so happened, fortunately, that in the place where La\u2018natu-llah had halted, the land was undulating, full of thorn brakes and narrow lanes. The forces, accordingly, were not in compact order. He had sent on most of the experienced men with Rustam Bah\u0101dur, and Himmat K., and \u0160\u0101lih Beg were amongst the foremost in (the ranks of) error. The army doomed to calamity first of all came in contact with N\u0101hir K. and Shams K., and a notable fight took place. By chance Himmat K. fell in the dust of destruction from a gun-shot wound, and a fight ensued between \u0160\u0101lih Beg, and N\u0101n\u016b K., Sayyid Ya\u2018q\u016bb, Sayyid Ghul\u0101m Mu\u1e25ammad, and other servants. In the height of the battle the elephant of Sayyid Ghul\u0101m Mu\u1e25ammad came and threw him (\u0160\u0101lih) from his horse; he fell severely wounded to the ground, and about a hundred of his men were slain. At this moment an elephant which was in the van of the rebel army turned round at the noise of the rockets and the lightning of the guns, and got into a narrow lane, on both sides of which were thorn brakes, and trod down many of the rebels. By the turning back of the elephant the ranks of the enemy were disordered. At this moment Sayyid Dil\u012br K. came fighting from the right wing. La\u2018natu-llah did not know of the killing of Himmat K. and \u0160\u0101lih, and, with the idea of helping them, urged on the steed of ruin. As the brave ones in the van, having displayed activity, had been mostly wounded, they could not stand the onset of La\u2018natu-llah, and turned back their rein, and it nearly happened that there was a great disaster. At this time the assistance of God displayed itself, and \u1e62af\u012b K. hastened from the centre to the support of the van. Just then La\u2018natu-llah heard of the killing of Himmat K. and \u0160\u0101lih Beg, and, on the appearance of the centre and the attack of Saf\u012b K., his courage failed him, and he became a vagabond in the desert of defeat and disaster. Sayyid Dil\u012br K. pursued him for a koss, and made many of the defeated\nthe harvest of the sword of vengeance. Q\u0101bil Beg, unfaithful to his salt, with a body of rebels, became captives in the claws of retribution. As La\u2018natu-llah was not sure about Sar-afr\u0101z K., he on the day of battle placed him in chains on an elephant and put him in charge of one of his slaves, with orders that if a defeat occurred he should kill him. In like manner he placed in chains on one of the elephants Bah\u0101dur, s. Sult\u0101n A\u1e25mad, and gave permission to kill him. When the fight took place the man in charge of Sult\u0101n A\u1e25mad\u2019s son put him to death with a dagger, but Sar-afr\u0101z K. threw himself down off the elephant. The man in charge of him in that confusion aimed a blow at him in his bewilderment, but it was not effectual. \u1e62afi K., finding him in the fight, sent him into the city. La\u2018natu-llah did not turn back till he arrived at Baroda. As the women of Sharza K. were captives of those who were loyal, he was helpless, and came and waited upon \u1e62afi K. Briefly, La\u2018natu-llah hastened from Baroda to Broach. The sons of Himmat K. were in the fort there. Although they did not admit him, yet they sent him 5,000 mahm\u016bdis by way of maintenance. For three days he remained outside the fort of Broach in a wretched state, and on the fourth went to Surat by sea. For nearly two months he remained there assembling his scattered men. As Surat was in B\u012b-daulat\u2019s jagir, he took nearly 4 lakhs of mahm\u016bdis from his officials there, and took possession of whatever he could by oppression and injustice. He again collected together those whose fortune was reversed and whose stars had been burnt, and betook himself to B\u012b- daulat at Burhanpur.\n\nIn fine, when this approved service performed by \u1e62afi K. and other loyal servants in Gujarat became known, each one was exalted with favours and kindnesses. \u1e62afi K. held the mansab of 700 personal and 300 horse: having given him that of 3,000 personal and 2,000 horse, I honoured him with the title of Saif K. Jah\u0101ng\u012br-sh\u0101h\u012b, and conferred on him a standard and drums. N\u0101hir K. had 1,000 with 200 horse; having given him the mansab of 3,000 with 2,000 horse, I bestowed on him the title of Sh\u012br K., and raised his head of honour with a horse, an elephant, and a jewelled sword. He is the (descendant ?)\ngrandson of (?)*, the brother of P\u016bran Mal L\u016bl\u016b (?), who was governor of R\u0101ys\u012bn and Chander\u012b. When Sh\u012br K., the Afghan (i.e., Sh\u012br Sh\u0101h), besieged the fort of R\u0101ys\u012bn, it is well known that he killed him (P\u016bran Mal) after promising him quarter, and that his women burnt themselves, committing \u201cJohar,\u201d according to the Hindu custom, in the fire of fame and modesty, so that the hand of no unlawful person should touch the skirt of their chastity. His sons and caste fellows went off to various\u2020 places. The father of N\u0101hir K., whose title was Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n, having gone to Mu\u1e25ammad K., governor of \u0100s\u012br and Burhanpur, became a Musalman, and when Mu\u1e25ammad K. died, \u1e24asan, his son, when in tender years, succeeded him. R\u0101ja \u2018Al\u012b K., brother of Mu\u1e25ammad K., put the child in confinement, and took possession of the government. After some time news reached R\u0101ja \u2018Al\u012b K. that Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n and a body of the servants of Mu\u1e25ammad K. had leagued together to attack him, and had determined to take \u1e24asan K. out of the fort and raise him to power. He was beforehand with them, and sent \u1e24ay\u0101t Kh\u0101n \u1e24abash\u012b, with many brave men, to the house of Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n, either to take him alike or to kill him. He, planting his foot firmly on his good fame, took to fighting, and when things went badly with him committed Johar, and passed from this borrowed life. At that time N\u0101hir K. was very young. \u1e24ay\u0101t Kh\u0101n Abyssinian, having asked \u2018Al\u012b K.\u2019s permission, adopted him as his son, and made him a Musalman. After his death R\u0101ja \u2018Al\u012b K. brought up N\u0101hir K., and took good care of him. When my revered father conquered \u0100s\u012br, N\u0101hir K. joined his service. He (Akbar) discerned the signs of bravery on his forehead, and raised him to a suitable mansab, and gave him in jagir the pargana of Mu\u1e25ammadp\u016br in Malwa. In my service he advanced more and more. Now that the grace of gratitude has been bestowed upon him, he has found the advantage of doing what was right.\n\n* Text, Nar Singh Deo. But the MSS. seem to have another name, Silhadi Deo (?). The name L\u016bl\u016b is also doubtful. The MSS. seem to have Bulur. In Elliot, IV. 402, P\u016bran Mal is called Bhaia.\n\n\u2020 Har kud\u0101m ba-\u1e6daraf\u012b aft\u0101dand.\nSayyid Dil\u012br K. is of the Sayyids of B\u0101rha; formerly his name was Sayyid \u2018Abdu-l-Wahh\u0101b. I raised him from the mansab of 1,000 and 800 horse to 2,000 and 1,200 horse, and presented him with a standard. They call twelve b\u0101ra in Hindi. As in the D\u016b-\u0101b there are twelve villages near each other which are the native country of these Sayyids, they have become known as the Sayyids of B\u0101rha. Some people make remarks about their lineage, but their bravery is a convincing proof of their being Sayyids, for there has never been a battle in this reign in which they have not been conspicuous, and in which some have not been killed. M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Aziz Koka always said the Sayyids of B\u0101rha were the averters of calamity from this dominion, and such is in reality the case.\n\nN\u0101n\u016b K. Afghan held the mansab of 800 personal and horse: it was ordered to be one of 1,500 personal and 1,200 horse. In the same manner the other loyal servants, according to their services and sacrifices, were promoted to high mansabs, and obtained the desire of their hearts in lofty employments. At this time A\u1e63\u0101lat K., s. Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n, was deputed to the assistance of my son (grandson) D\u0101war-bakhsh in Gujarat, and I sent N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn Qul\u012b into the Subah to bring Sharza K., Sar-afr\u0101z K., and the other leaders of the rebel army who had been made captive in the land of retribution, chained, to the Court.\n\nOn this day it was reported to me that Min\u016b-chihr, s. Sh\u0101h-naw\u0101z K., had separated himself from B\u012b-daulat under the guidance of good fortune, and had joined the service of my fortunate son Sh\u0101h Parw\u012bz. I\u2019tiq\u0101d K., governor of Kashmir, was promoted to the mansab of 4,000 personal and 3,000 horse.\n\nAs the huntsmen brought news that in this neighbourhood a tiger had made its appearance, I felt disposed to hunt it. After entering the forest three other tigers became visible. Having killed all four, I returned to the palace. I have such a liking for tiger shooting that whilst I can get it I do not go after other sport. Sult\u0101n Mas\u2018\u016bd, s. Sult\u0101n Ma\u1e25m\u016bd (of Ghaznin) (may the lights of Allah be his testimony!), was also much inclined to tiger shooting. With regard to his\nkilling of tigers strange tales have been recorded, especially in the history of Baihaqi,* who has kept a diary of what he saw with his own eyes. Among these things he writes that one day he (Mas\u2018\u016bd) went to hunt tigers in the borders of Hindustan, and was riding an elephant. A very large tiger came out from the wood, and made for the elephant. He threw a javelin (*kh\u012bsh\u1e6d*) and struck the tiger\u2019s chest. The tiger, enraged at the pain, came up on the elephant\u2019s back, and the Amir knelt down and struck him such a blow with his sword that he cut off both the tiger\u2019s fore-feet, and the tiger fell backwards and died. It happened to me once when I was prince that I had gone out in the Punjab to hunt tigers. A powerful tiger appeared out of the wood. I fired at him from the elephant, and the tiger in great fury rose and came on the elephant\u2019s back, and I had not time to put down my gun and seize my sword. Inverting the gun, I knelt, and with both hands struck him with the stock over the head and face so that he fell on to the ground and died.\n\nOne of the strange things that happened was that one day I was on an elephant, and was hunting wolves in Aligarh\u2020 in the N\u016bh forest. A wolf appeared, and I struck it with a bullet on its face (*mana*) near the lobe of the ear. The bullet penetrated for about a span. From that bullet it fell and gave up its life. It has often happened in my presence that powerful (*jaw\u0101n\u0101n*) men, good shots with the bow, have shot twenty or thirty arrows at them, and not killed. As it is not right to write about oneself, I must restrain the tongue of my pen from saying more.\n\nOn the 29th of the month I presented a string of pearls to Jagat Singh, s. R\u0101n\u0101 Karan. At this time it was reported to\n\n* Rieu, Cat., I. 158 b.\n\u2020 Text has K\u016bh-i-K\u016bl. But the I.O. MSS. show that the true reading is K\u016bl N\u016bh bau, and it appears from the Ayin, Jarrett, II. 186, that N\u016bh is a district in K\u016bl\u2014i.e., Aligarh. *Gur\u016b* is a wolf, and *Kur\u0101g* a rhinoceros, but probably a wolf is here meant. It is not likely that there were rhinoceros in Aligarh, though Ab\u016b-l-fa\u017cl says there were rhinoceros in Sambhal (Jarrett, II. 281). *T\u012br* means an arrow as well as a bullet. The word *mana*, \u201cface,\u201d is not in text, but occurs in both the I.O. MSS.\nme that Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Husain, Zamindar of Pakl\u012b, had died. I gave his mansab and jagir to Sh\u0101dm\u0101n, his eldest son.\n\nOn the 7th of the month of Amurd\u0101d Ibr\u0101h\u012bm \u1e24usain, a servant of my fortunate son Sh\u0101h Parwiz, came from the victorious army, and brought news of the victory of the chiefs of the everlasting State. The report of my son laid before me the particulars of the fight, and the exertions of the brave and distinguished men in it. I performed the dues of thanksgiving for this favour, which was of God\u2019s grace alone. The details of this are as follows: When the royal troops in the army of the prince of high degree crossed the pass of Ch\u0101nd\u0101,* and entered the province of Malwa, B\u012b-daulat, with 20,000 horse, 300 fighting elephants, and a large force of artillery, left M\u0101nd\u016b in order to fight. He dispatched a body of the Barg\u012bs (Mahrattas) of the Deccan with J\u0101d\u016b R\u0101y and \u016aday R\u0101m, \u0100lash K., and other rebels to make a raid (qazz\u0101qi) on the royal camp. Mah\u0101bat K. made proper arrangements. He placed the illustrious prince in the gh\u0101ul (centre), and he himself proceeded with the whole army, and in marching and in halting observed the conditions of caution. The Barg\u012bs kept at a great distance, and did not put forward the foot of bravery. One day it was Mans\u016br K. Farangi\u2019s turn to be with the rear-guard. At the time of pitching the camp Mah\u0101bat K., by way of caution, was standing with his army drawn up outside the camp, in order that the men might fence it in at their ease. As Mans\u016br K. had been drinking on the road, he was coming to the stage drunk with the wine of pride. It happened an army was seen in the distance, and the wine put the idea into his head that he must charge. Without telling his brothers or his men, he mounted and charged, and drove off two or three Barg\u012bs, and came to where J\u0101d\u016b R\u0101y and \u016aday R\u0101m were standing with two or three thousand cavalry drawn up. As was their custom, they attacked him from all sides and surrounded him. He fought as long as there was breath in his body, and gave up his life on the path of loyalty.\n\nDuring these days Mah\u0101bat K. was continually capturing, by messages and letters, the afflicted hearts of a number of\n\n* Ch\u0101nd\u0101 Gh\u0101t between Ajmere and Malwa.\nmen who out of timidity and confusion had accompanied B\u012b-\ndaulat. When men read the lines of despair on the page of\nhis (Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u2019s) condition, letters also came from that\nside, asking for agreements (gaul). After B\u012b-daulat came out\nof the fort of M\u0101nd\u016b, he in the first instance sent forward a\nbody of Barg\u012bs, and after them he sent Rustam K., Taq\u012b, and\nBarq-and\u0101z K. with a body of musketeers. Then he sent\nD\u0101r\u0101b K., Bh\u012bm, Bairam Beg, and his other active men. As\nhe could not resolve to give battle in person, he was con-\ntinually looking backwards. He crossed the war-elephants\nover the Narbadda with the artillery waggons, and went him-\nself unattended behind D\u0101r\u0101b and Bh\u012bm; turning his face of\nruin towards the battle. On the day when the royal camp\nwas pitched at K\u0101liy\u0101daha, B\u012b-daulat sent his army against\nthe victorious forces, and stationed himself with Kh\u0101n-kh\u0101n\u0101n\nand a few men at the distance of a koss in the rear. Barq-\nand\u0101z K., who had made an agreement with Mah\u0101bat K.,\nwas lying in wait. When the armies were ranged opposite\nto each other, he got his opportunity, and attacked with a\nbody of musketeers, and joined the royal army, crying out,\n\u201cSuccess to King Jah\u0101ng\u012br!\u201d When he reached Mah\u0101bat K.,\nthe latter took him to wait on my fortunate son Parwiz, who\nbestowed royal favours upon him. Previously he bore the\nname of Bah\u0101\u2019u-d-d\u012bn, and was a servant of Zain K. After\nthe latter\u2019s death he enlisted among the Turkish gunners. As\nhe was active in the performance of his duty, and had a band\nof men with him, considering him worthy of patronage, I\ngave him the title of Barq-and\u0101z K. When I sent B\u012b-daulat\nto the Deccan, I put him at the head of the artillery, and\nsent him with him. Although in the beginning he placed the\nscar of curse on the forehead of his obedience, yet in the end\nhe turned out well and came at a good time. On the same\nday Rustam, who was one of his (Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u2019s) chief servants,\nand on whom he had perfect reliance, when he found that\nFortune had turned away from him, made a compact with\nMah\u0101bat K. By the guidance of good fortune and reliance\non God, he, with Mu\u1e25ammad Mur\u0101d Badakhsh\u012b and other\nmansabdars, left the ill-fated army, and joined that of the\nillustrious prince. B\u012b-daulat\u2019s hand and heart were paralyzed on hearing this news, and he suspected all his own servants, and still more the royal servants he had with him, of faithlessness and unreliability. During the night he sent for the men who were in front, and decided on flight, and in bewilderment crossed the Narbadda. At this time, again, some of his servants took the opportunity of separating themselves from him, and joined the service of my fortunate son. Each of them received favours according to his condition. On the day that he crossed the river Narbadda, a letter fell into the hand of one of his men, that Mah\u0101bat K. had written in answer to Z\u0101hid\u2019s K. letter, making him hopeful of the royal favour, and urging him to come in. This they sent direct to B\u012b-daulat, and he, becoming suspicious of Z\u0101hid K., imprisoned him with his three sons. Z\u0101hid K. is s. Shaj\u0101\u2018at K., who was one of the Amirs and trusted servants of my revered father. I had patronized this wretch in consideration of his claims of service and of his position as a house-born one (kh\u0101na-z\u0101d), and given him the title of Khan and the rank of 1,500, and had sent him with B\u012b-daulat for the conquest of the Deccan. When I summoned the Amirs of that quarter on account of the business of Qandahar, although a special farman of urgency was sent to him, the wretch did not come to Court, and gave himself out as an adherent and devoted servant of B\u012b-daulat. After the defeat near Delhi, he turned back. Though* he had not a family, he had not the good fortune to pay his respects, or to cleanse the dust of shame and the stain of sin from the tablet of his forehead. At last the True Recompenser caught him on this day, and his property, to the extent of one lac and Rs. 30,000, was confiscated by B\u012b-daulat.\n\nWhen\u2020 thou hast done evil, think not thyself free of calamities For retribution is according to natural law.\n\n* Apparently the meaning is that he had no family with Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u2019s army, and so could not be deterred from leaving Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n through fear of their fate. See below, the reference to S. \u0160al\u0101bat\u2019s arrangements about his family.\n\n\u2020 This couplet comes from Niz\u0101mi\u2019s Khusrau u Shirin, and is quoted by B\u0101bur.\nBriefly, B\u012b-daulat having quickly crossed the Narbadda, drew all the boats over to that side, and having secured the fords with men that he trusted, he left Bairam Beg, his Bakhshi, with a force of trustworthy men and a body of the Barg\u012bs from the Deccan on the bank of the river. Taking the artillery-waggons, he himself went towards the fort of \u0100s\u012br and to Burhanpur. Meanwhile Taq\u012b, his servant, caught the runner whom Kh\u0101n-kh\u0101n\u0101n had sent to Mah\u0101bat K., and took him to B\u012b-daulat. This couplet was written on the margin of the letter:\n\nHundreds are watching me\nOtherwise I'd fly away from trouble.\n\nB\u012b-daulat sent for him with his sons from his quarters, and showed him the writing. Although he made excuses, he could give no answer that could be listened to. In short, he kept him with D\u0101r\u0101b and his other sons in surveillance near his own station, and the lot he had himself drawn\u2014viz., that hundreds were watching him\u2014happened to him. At this time I gave Ibr\u0101h\u012bm \u1e24usain, the servant of my prosperous son who had brought the report of the victory, the title of Kh\u016bsh-khabar K., with a dress of honour, and an elephant, and sent a gracious farman to the Prince and Mah\u0101bat K. by Khaw\u0101\u1e63\u1e63 K. I also sent with him a pah\u016bnch\u012b* (bracelet) of great value to my son (Parw\u012bz) and a jewelled sword to Mah\u0101bat K. As Mah\u0101bat K. had done approved service, I gave him the mansab of 7,000 personal and horse.\n\nSayyid \u1e62al\u0101bat K., having come from the Deccan, had the good fortune to pay his respects, and received special favours. He was one of those employed in the Deccan. When B\u012b-daulat, having been defeated near Delhi, went to the fort of M\u0101nd\u016b, he placed his children in independent territory under the protection of God, and went off by secret routes to pay his respects (to me). M\u012brz\u0101 \u1e24asan, s. M\u012brz\u0101 Rustam \u1e62afaw\u012b, having obtained leave to proceed to his appointment as faujdar of Bahraich, was given the mansab of 1,500 personal and 500 horse, original and increased. Having sent La\u02bfl Beg, Superintendent of the Record Department, to my fortunate son\n\n* See Ja\u02bffar Shar\u012bf\u2019s Q\u0101n\u016bn-i-Isl\u0101m. App., p. xxiv.\nSh\u0101h Parw\u012bz, I sent with him a special dress of honour and a n\u0101dir\u012b for him, and a turban for Mah\u0101bat K. Khaw\u0101\u1e63\u1e63 K., who had previously been sent to him and had returned, waited upon me with good news (of him). Kh\u0101na-z\u0101d K., s.-Mah\u0101bat K., was given the mansab of 5,000 personal and horse.\n\nAt this time I enjoyed myself for a day with hunting nilg\u0101w. Whilst I was hunting I saw a snake the length of which was $2\\frac{1}{2}$ yards, and its girth equal to three cubits (dast). He had swallowed half a hare, and was in the act of swallowing the other half. When the huntsmen picked him up and brought him to me, the hare fell out of his mouth. I ordered them to put it into its mouth again, but they could not do it, however much they exerted themselves; but by using great violence the corner of his mouth was torn to pieces. After this I ordered them to open its belly. Thereupon another entire hare came out. They call this kind of snake ch\u016b\u1e6dal* in Hindustan, and it grows so large that it swallows a hog-deer (kot\u0101h-p\u0101cha) entire; but it is not poisonous, and does not bite. One day during the same hunt I shot a female nilg\u0101w, and two fully formed young ones were found inside. As I heard that the flesh of nilg\u0101w fawns was delicate and delicious, I ordered the royal cooks to prepare a d\u016b-piy\u0101za\u2020 (a kind of rich fricassee). Certainly it was not without flavour.\n\nOn the 15th of the Divine month of Shahriwar Rustam K., Mu\u1e25ammad Mur\u0101d, and several other servants of B\u012b-daulat, who under the guidance of good luck had separated themselves from him and entered the service of my fortunate son Sh\u0101h Parw\u012bz, according to orders came to Court, and had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. Having promoted Rustam K. to the mansab of 5,000 personal and 4,000 horse, and Mu\u1e25ammad Mur\u0101d to that of 1,000 personal and 500 horse, I made them hopeful of daily increasing favours. Rustam K. by extraction is a Badakhsh\u012b. His name was Y\u016bsuf Beg. He is connected with Mu\u1e25ammad-qul\u012b of Isfahan, who was agent for and prime minister of M\u012brz\u0101 Sulaim\u0101n (of Badakhshan). He was first of all in the service of the Court,\n\n* Dh\u0101min, python (?) \u2020 See Blochmann, 60.\nand passed his days mostly in the Subahs. He was included among the smaller mansabdars. Having been deprived of his jagir for some reason, he came to B\u012b-daulat, and entered his service. He had a perfect knowledge of tiger-hunting. He also did good service with him, especially in the affair of the R\u0101n\u0101. B\u012b-daulat selected him out of all his servants, and made him an Amir. As I bestowed much favour on him (Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n), at his request I gave him the title of Khan, with a standard and drums. For some time he conducted as his agent the government of Gujarat, and did not manage badly.\n\nMu\u1e25ammad Mur\u0101d is the son of Maq\u1e63\u016bd M\u012br-\u0101b (butler), who was one of the old servants of Mirz\u0101 Sulaim\u0101n and Mirz\u0101 Sh\u0101h-r\u016bkh.\n\nOn this day Sayyid Bahwa came from Gujarat, and waited on me. N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn Quli brought in chains to the Court forty-one of the rebels, who had been taken prisoners at Ahmadabad. Sharza K. and Q\u0101bil Beg, who were ring-leaders of the seditious, I executed by throwing them under the feet of warlike (mast) elephants. On the 20th of the same month, corresponding with the 18th of the month of Z\u012b-q\u0101\u02bfda, a daughter was given by the grace of God to my son Sh\u0101hriy\u0101r by the granddaughter* of I\u02bftim\u0101du-d-daula. I hope that her advent\u2020 will be propitious and blessed to this State. On the 22nd of the month the feast of my solar weighment took place, and the 55th year of the age of this suppliant began auspiciously and happily. According to annual custom, I had myself weighed against gold and other valuables, and gave them to deserving people. Among these I gave Rs. 2,000 to Shaikh A\u1e25mad\u2021 of Sihrind. On the 1st of the Divine month of Mihr M\u012br Jumla was promoted to the mansab of 3,000 personal and 300 horse. Muq\u012bm, the Bakhshi of Gujarat, was given the title of Kif\u0101yat K. As the innocence of Sar-far\u0101z K.\u00a7 was established to my satisfaction, I took him\n\n* Daughter of N\u016br Jah\u0101n.\n\u2020 Blochmann, p. 311, calls her Arz\u0101n\u012b Begam. The Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma (306) calls her L\u0101rdil\u012b Begam. A MS. of the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma in my possession calls her Wali Begam. She was born on September 4, 1623.\n\u2021 The holy man formerly mentioned.\n\u00a7 He had been captured in Gujarat when \u1e62afi K. defeated \u2018Abdu-llah.\nout of prison, and allowed him to pay his respects. At the request of my son Shahriy\u0101r, I went to his house. He had prepared a grand entertainment, and presented suitable offerings, and gave dresses of honour to most of the servants.\n\nAt this time a report came from my fortunate son Sh\u0101h Parwiz that B\u012b-daulat had crossed the river of Burhanpur (the Tapt\u012b), and was wandering in the desert of error. The particulars are that when he crossed the Narbadda and drew all the boats to that side, and fortified the banks of the river and the ferries with cannon and muskets, he left Bairam Beg on the bank with a large number of the rebels, and withdrew towards \u0100s\u012br and Burhanpur. The Kh\u0101n-kh\u0101n\u0101n and D\u0101r\u0101b he took with him under surveillance.\n\nAnd now, for the sake of enlivening my narrative, a few words must be said about \u0100s\u012br. The said fort, in its great height and strength, is not in want of my praise. Before B\u012b-daulat went to the Deccan it was in the charge of Khw\u0101ja Nasru-l-lah, s. Khw\u0101ja Fat\u1e25u-l-lah, who was one of the household slaves and ancient servants. Afterwards, at the request of B\u012b-daulat, it was handed over to M\u012br \u1e24us\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn, s. M\u012br Jam\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn \u1e24usain.* As the daughter of N\u016br Jah\u0101n Begam\u2019s maternal uncle (tayha\u2019\u012b) was married\u2020 to him, when B\u012b-daulat, having been defeated in the neighbourhood of Delhi, turned his rein towards Malwa and M\u0101nd\u016b, N\u016br Jah\u0101n Begam wrote to him and strictly urged him, saying: \u201cBeware, a thousand times beware, not to allow B\u012b-daulat and his men to come near the fort, but strengthen the towers and gates, and do your duty, and do not act in such a manner that the stain of a curse and ingratitude for favours should fall on the honour or the forehead of a Sayyid.\u201d In truth, he strengthened it well, and the arrangements of the fort were not of such a sort that B\u012b-daulat\u2019s bird of thought could fly up to its border, or the conquest of it be quickly accomplished. In brief, when B\u012b-daulat sent one of his attendants, of the name\n\n* The author of the dictionary.\n\u2020 See Ma\u2019\u0101siru-l-Umar\u0101, III. 382. His wife was the sister of Ahmad Beg, the \u201cbrother\u2019s son of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm K. Fat\u1e25-jang. But if so would she not be the daughter of Shar\u012bf and niece of N\u016br Jah\u0101n? See Blochmann, 512.\nof Shar\u012bf\u0101, to the above-mentioned, he (Shar\u012bf\u0101) seduced him by means of promises and threats, and it was settled (between Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n and Shar\u012bf\u0101) that when \u1e24us\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn should come down to take the letter and dress of honour which had been sent, he should not be allowed to go up again. That wretch, immediately Shar\u012bf\u0101 arrived, put away on the shelf of forgetfulness what he owed on account of his bringing up and the favours conferred on him, and without opposition or effort handed over the fort to Shar\u012bf\u0101, and with his wife* and child went to B\u012b-daulat, who made him accursed of the Faith and in the world by bestowing on him the mansab of 4,000 personal, and a standard and drums, and the title of Murta\u1e93\u0101 K.\u2014a disgraceful name to all eternity.\n\nIn short, when that one of reversed fortune reached the foot of the fort of \u0100s\u012br, he took with him Kh\u0101n-kh\u0101n\u0101n, D\u0101r\u0101b, and all his evil-minded offspring up to the fort, and remaining there for three or four days, and having set his mind at ease about provisions, etc., handed it over to one Gop\u0101l D\u0101s, a Rajput, who had formerly been an attendant of Sar-buland R\u0101y, and entered his service when he went to the Deccan. He left the women and his superfluous baggage, and took with him his three wives with their children and some maidservants. At first he proposed to imprison Kh\u0101n-kh\u0101n\u0101n and D\u0101r\u0101b in the fort, but at last changed his mind, and bringing them down with him, hastened to Burhanpur. At this time La\u2018natu-llah, after suffering disgrace and contempt, came from Surat and joined him. In great perplexity, B\u012b-daulat employed Sar-buland R\u0101y, the son of R\u0101y Bhoj H\u0101r\u0101, who is one of the brave Rajput servants, and who is fed from the royal table (?), as his mediator, and by letters and messages made proposals of peace. Mah\u0101bat K. said that until Kh\u0101n-kh\u0101n\u0101n came, peace was impossible. His (Mah\u0101bat\u2019s) sole purpose was by these means to separate from him that head of deceivers who was the ring-leader of trouble and sedition. Being helpless, B\u012b-daulat brought him (Kh\u0101n-kh\u0101n\u0101n) out of prison, and satisfied himself by taking an oath from him on the Qor\u0101n. In order to please him and strengthen his\n\n* I.O. MS., 381, and the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma mention the wife.\npromises and oath, he took him inside the female apartment and made a confidant* of him, and brought his own wife and son to him, and made use of all kinds of entreaty and lamentation. The gist of his (Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u2019s) remarks was: \u201cMy times are hard, and my position difficult; I make myself over to you, and make you the guardian of my honour. You must act so that I no longer undergo contempt and confusion.\u201d The Kh\u0101n-kh\u0101n\u0101n, with a view to bring about peace, parted from B\u012b-daulat and proceeded to the royal army. It was settled that he should remain on the other side of the river, and arrange matters relating to peace in writing. According to fate, before Kh\u0101n-kh\u0101n\u0101n arrived on the bank of the river, some of the brave warriors and victorious youths one night found an opportunity and crossed over at a place where the rebels were careless. On hearing this news the pillars of their courage trembled, and Bairam Beg could not keep firm the foot of error and ignorance, or engage in driving them back. Whilst he was in this agitation\u2020 many crossed the river, and on the same night the rebels of evil fortune were separated from each other like the Ban\u0101tu-n-na\u2018\u0101sh\u2021 and took to flight. By the unfailing good fortune (of Jah\u0101ng\u012br) the Kh\u0101n-kh\u0101n\u0101n fell into perplexity (lit. fell into the shash-dar\u00a7 position), and could neither go nor stay where he was. At this time again letters arrived from my prosperous son mingling threats with promises. The Kh\u0101n-kh\u0101n\u0101n, finding only despair and ruin in the page of B\u012b-daulat\u2019s affairs, hastened, through the mediation of Mah\u0101bat K., to wait upon my fortunate son. B\u012b-daulat, on hearing of the departure of Kh\u0101n-kh\u0101n\u0101n and the crossing of the Narbadda by the victorious army and the flight of Bairam Beg, lost courage, and, notwithstanding a flood in the river and the violence of the rain, crossed the Tap\u1e6d\u012b in a state of wretchedness, and went off towards the Deccan. In this confusion many of the royal servants and his own attendants willingly or unwillingly separated, and\n\n* Ma\u1e25ram s\u0101kht, \u201cmade him one who could enter the Harem.\u201d\n\u2020 The text wrongly has ba-chand instead of ba-jamb\u012bd.\n\u2021 Daughters of the Bier\u2014i.e., the constellation of the Plough.\n\u00a7 Shash-dar is the name of an impasse in the game of nard.\ndid not accompany him. As the native country of J\u0101do R\u0101y and \u016aday R\u0101m and \u0100tash K. was on the route, they thought it better for themselves to keep with him for some stages, but J\u0101do R\u0101y did not come into his camp, and followed him at the distance of one stage. He took possession of such property as the men in this confusion and fear for their lives abandoned. On the day he (Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n) started from the other side of the river (the Tapt\u012b) he sent a message by one of his immediate attendants of the name of Z\u016b-l-faq\u0101r K. Turkm\u0101n, summoning Sar-buland K. Afghan, with the message that it seemed to him contrary to courage and the due performance of his engagements that he had as yet not crossed the river. \"Fidelity was the glory of men; the faithlessness of no one has touched me (Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n) so much as yours.\" He (Sar-buland) was standing on horseback on the river-bank when Z\u016b-l-faq\u0101r* K. came and delivered the message. Sar-buland did not give a precise answer, and was undecided as to whether to stay or go. In his perplexity and by way of objection he told Z\u016b-l-faq\u0101r to let go his bridle. Z\u016b-l-faq\u0101r drew his sword, and struck at his waist. At this crisis an Afghan interposed a short spear which the people of India call a barchh\u0101, and the blow of the sword caught the shaft, and the point of the sword did not reach Sar-buland\u2019s waist. After swords were drawn, the Afghans attacked Z\u016b-l-faq\u0101r and cut him in pieces. The son of Sult\u0101n Mu\u1e25ammad, the treasurer, who was B\u012b-daulat\u2019s page, for friendship\u2019s sake had come (with Z\u016b-l-faq\u0101r) without B\u012b-daulat\u2019s permission, and was also killed.\n\nBriefly, when the news of his leaving Burhanpur and of the victorious army\u2019s approaching that city reached me, I sent Khaw\u0101\u1e63\u1e63 K. on the wings of haste to my loyal son, and strongly impressed upon him that he must not relax his efforts, but must determine either to take him alive or to drive him out of the imperial territory. It was said that if things went badly with him on this side, it was probable that he would throw himself by the road of Qu\u1e6dbu-l-mulk\u2019s country into the provinces of Orissa and Bengal. This, too, was in accordance\n\n* The Mu\u1e25ammad Beg of Roe?\nwith military plans. So out of caution, which is becoming to a ruler, I appointed Mirz\u0101 Rustam to be governor of Allahabad and dismissed him with orders that if such circumstances should so occur (as Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u2019s going to Bengal), he should rectify matters.\n\nAt this time my son (farzand) Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n came from Multan, and had the good fortune to pay his respects. By way of nazar he presented 1,000 muhrs and a ruby of the value of Rs. 100,000, a pearl, and other jewels. I gave an elephant to Rustam K. On the 9th of the Divine month of \u0100b\u0101n Khaw\u0101\u1e63\u1e63 K. brought a report from the prince and Mah\u0101bat K. to the effect that when my son (Parwiz) reached Burhanpur, though many of his men had remained behind in consequence of the heavy rains, he, according to orders, without delay had crossed the river (Tapt\u012b), and gone in pursuit of B\u012b-daulat. B\u012b-daulat, on hearing this terrible news, was marching on. On account of the heaviness of the rain and the excessive quantity of mud and constant marching his beasts of burden had become exhausted. If any baggage was left behind no inquiries were made, and he (Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n) and his children and dependents thought themselves lucky to save their lives and did not trouble about their goods. The army of good fortune having come down the pass of Bhangar, hastened after him as far as the pargana of Ankot,* about forty koss from Burhanpur. B\u012b-daulat in this state reached the fort of M\u0101h\u016br, and when he knew that J\u0101do R\u0101y and \u016aday R\u0101m and the other Dakhanis would not go with him any farther, he did not disgrace them, but let them go. Leaving the heavy elephants with the goods and chattels with \u016aday R\u0101m in the fort, he himself started for Qutb\u016bl-mulk\u2019s territory. When his departure from the royal territory was ascertained, my fortunate son, with the approval of Mah\u0101bat K. and other loyalists, turned rein from that pargana. On the first of the Divine month of \u0100b\u0101n he entered Burhanpur. R\u0101ja S\u0101rang Deo was sent to my son with a gracious farman.\n\nQ\u0101sim K. was raised to the mansab of 4,000 personal and 2,000 horse. Mirak Mu\u2018\u012bn, Bakhshi of Kabul, at the request\n\n* Jarrett, II. 239.\nof Mah\u0101bat K., was honoured with the title of Khan. Alf K. Qiy\u0101m-kh\u0101n\u012b, having come from the Subah of Patna, paid his respects, and was appointed to the charge of the fort of Kangra. I presented him with a standard. On the 1st of the Divine month of \u0100zar B\u0101qi K. came from J\u016bn\u0101garh and waited on me.\n\nAs I was at ease with regard to the affair of B\u012b-daulat, and the heat of Hindustan did not agree with my constitution, on the 2nd of the month, corresponding with the 1st of \u1e62afar* my camp started from Ajmir for a tour and to hunt in the pleasant regions of Kashmir. Before this I had appointed the chief of the state \u0100\u1e63af K. Subahdar of Bengal, and gave him leave. As I had taken a great liking to his society, and he was distinguished above all the other servants for ability and good disposition and tact, and is moreover unequalled in all kinds of propriety, and I regretted separation from him, I had broken through that purpose, and had sent for him to wait upon me. He came on this day, and had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. Jagat Singh, s. R\u0101n\u0101 Karan, took leave on his return to his native country, and was given a dress of honour and a jewelled dagger. R\u0101ja S\u0101rang Deo brought a report from my fortunate son Sh\u0101h Parwiz and Mah\u0101bat K. Mad\u0101ru-s-saltana, and kissed the threshold. It was written that their minds were at ease with regard to the affair of B\u012b-daulat, and that the rulers of the Deccan, willingly or unwillingly, were performing the dues of obedience and submission. His Majesty (Jah\u0101ng\u012br) might make his mind at ease about that quarter and enjoy himself in hunting and travelling in whatever place in the royal dominions he might approve of and which was good for his health. On the 20th of the month M\u012brz\u0101 W\u0101li, having come from Sironj, waited on me. \u1e24ak\u012bm M\u016bmin\u0101 was raised to the mansab of 1,000. A\u1e63\u0101lat K., s. Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n, according to order, came from Gujarat, and had the good fortune to pay his respects.\n\nAt this time a report came from \u2018Aq\u012bdat K., Bakhshi of the Deccan, containing the news of R\u0101ja Girdhar\u2019s having been\n\n* 1 \u1e62afar, 1033 = November 14, 1623.\nkilled. The particulars of this event are that one of the brothers of Sayyid Kab\u012br B\u0101rha, who was an attendant of my fortunate son Sh\u0101h Parwiz, gave his sword to brighten and put on the wheel (to sharpen) to a cutler who had a shop close to the house of R\u0101ja Girdhar. The next day, when he came to fetch his sword, a conversation took place as to the charge for the work, and the people of the Sayyid struck the cutler some blows with a stick. The Raja\u2019s people in supporting him used their whips on them. By chance two or three young Sayyids of B\u0101rha had lodgings in that neighbourhood, and hearing of this disturbance, went to the assistance of the aforesaid Sayyid. The fire of strife was lighted, and a fight took place between the Sayyids and Rajputs, ending in an encounter with arrows and swords. Sayyid Kab\u012br, becoming aware of this, came to assist with thirty or forty horsemen, and at this time R\u0101ja Girdhar, with a body of Rajputs and his caste people, according to the custom of the Hindus, were sitting barebodied and eating their food. Becoming aware of the coming of Sayyid Kab\u012br and the violence of the Sayyids, he brought his men inside the house and firmly closed the door. The Sayyids, setting fire to the door, forced their way inside and the fight went to such a length that R\u0101ja Girdhar and twenty-six of his servants were killed and forty others wounded. Four of the Sayyids were also killed. After R\u0101ja Girdhar was killed, Sayyid Kab\u012br took the horses out of his stable to his own house and returned. The Rajput officers, when informed of the slaying of R\u0101ja Girdhar, came on horseback in great numbers from their houses, and all the B\u0101rha Sayyids came to the aid of Sayyid Kab\u012br. They assembled in the plain outside the citadel, and the fire of trouble and calamity increased, and it nearly came to a great disturbance. Mah\u0101bat K., being informed of it, immediately mounted and went there, and bringing the Sayyids into the citadel, and soothing the Rajputs in a manner suitable to the occasion, took some of their chief men with him and went to the house of Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam, which was near there. He soothed them down in a proper way, and promised and became security for an inquiry into the matter. When this news reached the prince\nhe also went to the quarters of the Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam, and soothed them with words appropriate to the state of affairs, and sent the Rajputs to their own houses. Next day Mah\u0101bat K. went to the house of R\u0101ja Girdhar, condoled and sympathized with his sons, and having contrived to get hold of Sayyid Kab\u012br put him into confinement. As the Rajputs would not be consoled without his being put to death, after a few days he executed him.\n\nOn the 23rd I appointed Mu\u1e25ammad Mur\u0101d faujdar of Ajmir, and sent him off. On this road I continually enjoyed myself in sporting. One day, while hunting, a t\u016bygh\u016bn (albino) partridge, which till now I had never seen, came to my sight, and I caught it with a hawk. By chance the hawk that caught it was also a t\u016bygh\u016bn. I ascertained by trial that the flesh of the black partridge was better than that of the white, and that the flesh of the large quail (b\u016bdana), which the people of India call gh\u0101ghar,* is better than that of the quail, which is a fighter. I compared the flesh of a fat kid with that of a lamb; the flesh of the fat kid is more delicious. By way of test I ordered them both to be cooked in the same way, so that I might discern the matter accurately. On this account I have recorded it.\n\nOn the 10th of the month of Dai, in the neighbourhood of the pargana of Rah\u012bm\u0101b\u0101d,\u2020 the huntsmen brought in news of a tiger. I ordered Ir\u0101dat K. and Fid\u0101\u02bei K. to take with them some of the guards (ahl-i-y\u0101tish) and surround the wood, and mounting (an elephant) I followed them and went towards the hunt. From the number of trees and thickness of the jungle it could not be well seen. Driving the elephant forward, the tiger\u2019s flank came into view, and with one wound from my gun he fell and gave up his life. Of all the tigers I have shot from the time when I was a prince until now I never saw a tiger like this for size and majesty and the symmetry of its limbs. I ordered the artists to take its portrait according to its real form and body. He weighed 8\u00bd Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b maunds;\n\n* Jerdon states that the black partridge is called gh\u0101ghar about Benares.\n\u2020 Probably Rah\u012bm\u0101b\u0101d in the B\u0101r\u012b L\u016b-\u0101b. Jarrett, II. 332.\nhis length, from the top of his head to the end of his tail, was $3\\frac{1}{2}$ cubits* and 2 fass\u016b (\u00bc of a yard).\n\nOn the 16th it was reported that Mumt\u0101z\u2020 K., the governor of Agra, had died. At first he was in the service of Bah\u0101dur K., the brother of Kh\u0101n Zam\u0101n. After they were killed he entered the service of my revered father. When I placed my foot in the world of existence that revered person favoured me with making him the N\u0101\u017c\u012br (Superintendent) of my establishment. For a period of fifty-six years he served me sincerely and zealously and in a manner to please me, and at no time did a speck of dust from him settle on the fringe of my heart. What is due to him for the excellence of his service is more than a clerk could write. May God Almighty overwhelm him in the ocean of His forgiveness!\n\nHaving conferred on Muqarrab K., who is one of the old officials,\u2021 the government and administration of Agra, I gave him his leave. In the neighbourhood of Fathp\u016br, Mukarram K. and his brother \u2018Abdu-s-Sal\u0101m had the good fortune to pay their respects. On the 22nd the entertainment for my lunar weighment took place in the town of Mathura, and the fifty-seventh year of my age began auspiciously and happily. At Mathura I went on by boat seeing what was to be seen, and hunting. On the way the huntsmen reported that a tigress with three cubs had appeared. Disembarking from the boat I engaged in the pleasure of sport. As the cubs were small I ordered them to be taken by hand, and killed the mother with my gun. At this time it was reported to me that the villagers \u00a7 and cultivators on the other side of the river Jumna had not given up stealing and highway robbery, and, passing their time in the shelter of thick jungles and difficult strong places in stubbornness and fearlessness, would not pay their rents to the jagirdars. I gave an order to Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n to take a\n\n* Dara\u2018 or zara\u2018, yards? The text gives his weight as 20\u00bd, but b\u012bst must be a mistake for hasht.\n\n\u2020 He was a eunuch, and originally had the name of I\u2018tib\u0101r K. He received the title of Mumt\u0101z K. in this year. T\u016bzuk, 359. See Blochmann, 433.\n\n\u2021 Az qat\u012bm\u0101n u b\u0101bariyy\u0101n (properly bairiyy\u0101n).\n\n\u00a7 Ganw\u0101r\u0101n u muz\u0101ri\u2018\u0101n.\nforce of mansabdars with him and give them exemplary punishment, and having slaughtered, imprisoned, and plundered them, raze to the ground their strongholds and forts, and tear up from the root their thorn-brakes of mischief and disturbance. The next day the force crossed the river and made a hot attack on them. As they had no time for escape by flight they planted firmly the foot of folly, and showed fight. Many of them were slaughtered: their women and children were taken prisoners, and much booty fell into the hands of the victorious army.\n\nOn 1st Bahman, having promoted Rustam K. to the faujdarship of the Sarkar of Qanauj, I sent him there.\n\nOn the 2nd \u2018Abdu-llah, s. \u1e24ak\u012bm N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn, of Teheran, was ordered to be capitally punished in my presence. The explanation of this brief announcement is as follows: When the ruler of Persia, on suspicion of his having money and other property, tortured his father, the aforesaid fled from Persia, and with a hundred miseries and adversities threw himself into Hindustan, and by the patronage of I\u2019tim\u0101du-d-daula was enrolled among the servants of the Court. By the aid of good fortune, having in a short time become well known, he was included among those who were in immediate attendance, and obtained a mansab of 500 and a fertile jagir, but as his capacity was small (lit., his digestion was narrow) he could not stand such great good fortune, and assumed ingratitude and unthankfulness; and constantly defiled his tongue with abuse* of his lord and master. At this time it was continually reported to me that as my kindness to him and observance of what was due to him increased, that ungrateful one blamed and abused me the more. When I considered the favours I had bestowed upon him, I could not believe these stories about him, but at last I heard from impartial and disinterested persons the disrespectful language which he had used with respect to me in assemblies and companies.\n\n* Text ba shukr u shuk\u016bh, but the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 213, has ba-shakw\u0101, \u201cwith complaints,\u201d and this must be correct. \u2018Abdu-llah indulged in abuse of his lord and master, khud\u0101 u khud\u0101wand-i-khwish\u2014i.e., Jahangir.\nThe charge was thus confirmed, and accordingly I summoned him to my presence and had him executed.*\n\n\"A red\u2020 tongue gives the green head to the winds.\" As the huntsmen reported that there was a tigress in this neighbourhood, by the mischief caused by which the inhabitants were oppressed, I ordered Fid\u0101'\u012b K. to take elephants with him and surround it. Mounting myself, I followed him into the forest. It soon came to view, and with one shot from my gun its affairs were finished. One day I was enjoying myself with sport, and caught a black partridge with a hawk. I ordered them to open its crop in my presence. A mouse it had swallowed whole came out of its crop, and which was not yet digested. I was greatly astonished that the pipe of its gullet, small as it was, should swallow a whole mouse and how it had done so. Without exaggeration, if anyone had told me the tale I should not have believed it. As I saw this myself I have recorded it on account of its strangeness. On the 6th of the month Delhi became the abode of good fortune.\n\nAs Jagat Singh, s. R\u0101ja B\u0101so, at the instigation of B\u012b-daulat, had gone out into the hills in the north of the Panjab, which are his hereditary abode, and raised a disturbance there, I appointed \u0160\u0101diq K. to punish him, as has been related in the preceding pages. At this time M\u0101dho Singh, his younger brother, was promoted to the title of Raja, and given a horse and robe of honour. An order was given for him to go to \u0160\u0101diq K. and attack the rebels with him.\n\nNext day I marched from the outskirts of the city, and alighted at Salimgarh. As the house of R\u0101ja Kishan D\u0101s was on the road, and he had made great efforts and entreated me to do so, I at his request threw the shadow of prosperity on his dwelling, and gratified the desire of that old servant. A few of his offerings were accepted in order to dignify him. Marching on the 20th from Salimgarh, I appointed Sayyid Bahwa Bukh\u0101r\u012b to the governorship of Delhi, which is his ordinary\n\n* Cf. Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 213-214.\n\u2020 A proverbial expression. It is quoted by Niz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn in the Tabaq\u0101t.\nresidence. In fact, he had already done this service well, and I had given him high rank.\n\nAt this time \u2018Al\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad, s. \u2018Al\u012b R\u0101y,* ruler of Tibet, by his father\u2019s order came to Court, and had the good fortune to pay his respects. It was clear that \u2018Al\u012b R\u0101y had a great affection for and attachment to this son, and held him dearer than his other children. He wished to make him his successor, and he was consequently envied by his brothers, and disputes arose between them. Abd\u0101l, s. \u2018Al\u012b R\u0101y, who was the eldest of his children, through this jealousy sought the patronage of the Khan of Kashghar and made him his protector,* so that when \u2018Al\u012b R\u0101y, who was very old and decrepit, should die, he might, under the protection of the W\u0101li of Kashghar, become ruler of Tibet. \u2018Al\u012b R\u0101y, suspecting that the brothers might attack \u2018Al\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad, and a disturbance might arise in his country, sent him to Court, his desire being that he might be attached to this Court, and his affairs might prosper by service to and kindness shown by the Court.\n\nOn the 1st of the Il\u0101h\u012b month of Isfand\u0101rmuz I pitched in the pargana of Umbala. Lashkar\u012b, s. Im\u0101m-wird\u012b, who had run away from B\u012b-daulat, and joined the service of my auspicious son Sh\u0101h Parwiz, having come on this date to Court, kissed the threshold. A report came from my son and Mah\u0101bat K. It contained the recommendation and the offer of service of \u2018\u0100dil K., with a letter which he had sent to Mah\u0101bat, in which were set forth his submissiveness and loyalty. Lashkar\u012b was sent back to Parwiz with a dress of honour, a n\u0101dir\u012b with pearl buttons for the prince, and a dress of honour for Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam and Mah\u0101bat K. At the request of my son I wrote a gracious farman to \u2018\u0100dil K. showing great favour to him, and sent him a robe of honour with a special n\u0101dir\u012b. I gave an order that if they thought fit they should send the above-mentioned\u2020 to \u2018\u0100dil K.\n\nOn the 5th I alighted at the garden of Sihrind. On the\n\n* \u2018Al\u012b R\u0101y was ruler of Little Tibet (Baltistan). Jahangir had married his daughter. Blochmann, 310, and Akbar-n\u0101ma, III. 603. The marriage took place in A.H. 1000 (1592).\n\u2020 That is, Lashkar\u012b.\nbank of the Beas \u0160\u0101diq K., Mukht\u0101r K., Isfandiy\u0101r, R\u0101ja R\u016bp Chand of Gwalior, and other Amirs who had been appointed to support him, having succeeded in restoring order in the northern hill-country, had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. The facts, briefly, are that Jagat Singh, at the instigation of B\u012b-daulat, had taken to the hills above-mentioned, and engaged in stirring up sedition and strife. As the field was clear (i.e., there was no one to oppose him) he passed over difficult mountains and defiles, and by attacking and plundering peasantry and the weak, heaped misfortune on them until \u0160\u0101diq K. arrived. He brought the Zamindars under control by means of fears and hopes, and made the overthrow of that wretched creature the object of his exertions. Jagat Singh strengthened the fort of Mau, and was protected by it. Whenever he found an opportunity he left that fortress and fought with the royal servants. At last his provisions were exhausted, and he came to despair of assistance from the other Zamindars. The elevation of his younger brother became a source of disturbance and anxiety to him. Helplessly he then sought for patronage, and begged the protection of N\u016br Jah\u0101n Begam, expressing shame and contrition, and sought a refuge in her mediation. In order to please and satisfy her, the pen of pardon was drawn through the record of his faults.\n\nOn this day reports came in from the officials in the Deccan that B\u012b-daulat, with La\u2018natu-llah, D\u0101r\u0101b, and other wretched (with broken wing and feathers) creatures in miserable condition, with blackened faces, had gone from the borders of Qu\u1e6dbu-l-mulk\u2019s territory towards Orissa and Bengal. In this journey great loss fell on him and his companions, many of whom, when a chance offered, with bare heads and feet, and having washed their hands of life (desperate), took to flight. Out of these one day M\u012brz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad, s. Af\u1e93al K., his Diwan, with his mother and his family, ran away during the march, and when the news reached B\u012b-daulat, he sent Ja\u2018far and Kh\u0101n-qul\u012b Uzbeg and some others of his confidential men in pursuit of him, that, if they could take him alive, well and good, or otherwise they should cut off his head and bring it\ninto his presence. They with all speed proceeded and caught him up on the road. Becoming aware of this, he sent his mother and family into the jungles and hid them there, and himself with a body of young men whom he relied on as companions, planted manfully the foot of courage and stood with their bows. In front of them there was a canal and a swamp (chihl\u0101). Sayyid Ja\u2018far K. wished to approach near him and take him with him by deceiving him, but however much he tried to persuade him by threatening and holding out hopes, it had no effect, and he answered him with life-taking arrows. He made a good fight of it, and sent Kh\u0101n-quli and some others of B\u012b-daulat\u2019s men to hell. Sayyid Ja\u2018far also was wounded. Finally Mirz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad received severe wounds and gambled away the cash of his life. But as long as he had breath he deprived many thereof. After he was killed, they cut off his head and took it to B\u012b-daulat.\n\nWhen B\u012b-daulat was defeated near Delhi and went to Mandu, he sent Af\u1e93al K. to get assistance and support from \u2018\u0100dil K. and others, forwarding with him an armlet (b\u0101z\u016b-band) for \u2018\u0100dil K., and a horse, an elephant, and a jewelled sword for \u2018Ambar. He first went to \u2018Ambar. After delivering his message he produced what B\u012b-daulat had sent for him, but \u2018Ambar would not accept them, saying he was the servant of \u2018\u0100dil K., who was at present the head of those in power in the Deccan: he should go first to him and explain what he desired. If he agreed, his slave would ally himself to and obey him, and in that case he would take whatever was sent, otherwise not. Af\u1e93al K. went to \u2018\u0100dil K., who received him very badly, and for a long time kept him outside the city and did not look into his affair, but put all kinds of slights upon him, but secretly asked for what B\u012b-daulat had sent for him and \u2018Ambar, and took possession of it. The aforesaid (Af\u1e93al K.) was there when he heard the news of the killing of his son and the ruin of his family, and so fell upon evil days. In short, B\u012b-daulat, in spite of all his (original) good fortune and happy auspices, undertook a long and distant journey, and came to the port of Machhl\u012b Patan (Masulipatam), which belongs to\nQutbu-l-mulk. Before reaching this place, he sent some of his men to Qutbu-l-mulk, and besought him for all sorts of assistance and companionship. Qutbu-l-mulk sent him a small amount of cash and goods for his support, and wrote to the warden of his frontier to conduct him in safety out of his territory, and encourage the grain-sellers and Zamindars to send grain and all other necessaries to his camp.\n\nOn the 27th of the month a strange event took place. Returning from the hunting-place, I had come back to the camp at night. By chance I crossed a stream of water, the bed of which was very rocky and the water running violently. One of the servants of the sharbat-kh\u0101na (wine-cellar) was conveying a huntsman\u2019s relish. He had a gold tray, which contained a salver and five cups. There were covers to the cups, and the whole was in a cotton bag. When he was crossing, his foot slipped and the tray fell out of his hand. As the water was deep and running rapidly, however much they searched and beat their hands and feet (exerted themselves), no trace of it could be found. Next day the state of the case was reported to me, and I ordered a number of boatmen and huntsmen to go to the place and make a careful search, and it perhaps might appear. By chance, in the place where it had fallen it was found, and more strange still, it had not been turned upside down, and not a drop of water had got into the cups. This affair is similar to what happened when H\u0101d\u012b was seated on the throne of the Khalifate. A ruby ring had been inherited by H\u0101r\u016bn from his father. H\u0101d\u012b sent a slave to H\u0101r\u016bn and asked for it. It happened that at that time H\u0101r\u016bn was seated on the bank of the Tigris. The slave gave the message, and H\u0101r\u016bn, enraged, said: \u201cI have allowed thee* to have the Khalifate, and thou dost not allow me one ring.\u201d In his rage he threw the ring into the Tigris. After some months by the decree of fate H\u0101d\u012b died, and the turn of the Khalifate came to H\u0101r\u016bn. He ordered divers to look for the ring in the place where he had thrown it. By the chances of destiny, and the aid of good fortune, at the first dive the ring was found, and brought and given into H\u0101r\u016bn\u2019s hand!\n\n* H\u0101d\u012b was H\u0101r\u016bnu-r-Rash\u012bd\u2019s elder brother.\nAt this time one day on the hunting ground the chief huntsman Im\u0101m-wird\u012b brought before me a partridge that had a spur on one leg and not on the other. As the way to distinguish the female lies in the spur, by way of testing me he asked whether this was a male or a female. I said at once \"A female.\" When they opened it an egg appeared inside (p\u012bsh\u012bna) its belly. The people who were in attendance asked with surprise by what sign I had discovered this; I said that the head and beak of the female are shorter than the male's. By investigation and often seeing (the birds) I had acquired this dexterity.* It is a strange thing that the windpipe in all animals (haiw\u0101n\u0101t), which the Turks call halq,\u2020 is single from the top of the throat to the crop (ch\u012bna-d\u0101n), while in the case of the bustard (jarz) it is different. In the bustard it is for four finger-breadths from the top of the throat single and then it divides into two branches and in this form reaches the crop. Also at the place where it divides into two branches there is a stoppage (sar-band) and a knot (gir\u012bh) is felt by the hand. In the kulang (crane) it is still stranger. In it the windpipe passes in a serpentine manner between the bones of the breast to the rump and then turns back from there and joins the throat. The jarz or charz (bustard) is of two kinds: one is a mottled black and the other b\u016br (a kind of dun colour). I now\u2021 discovered that there are not two kinds, but that which is a mottled black is the male, and that which is dun-coloured is the female. The proof of it is this, that in the piebald there are testicles and in the dun one there are eggs; this has been repeatedly found on examination.\n\nI have a great liking for fish, and all kinds of good fish are brought for me; the best fish in Hindustan is the roh\u016b, and\n\n* Text mulka. Perhaps the word may be malka-i-\u0101n, \"possession of it\"\u2014i.e., possession of such knowledge. The MSS. have \u0101n after mulka.\n\n\u2020 Text hanaq. But the MSS. have merely haqq, and it is said in the dictionaries that there is a bird called the hagg.\n\n\u2021 This corrects a previous statement to the effect that the black and red bustards were two species.\nafter that the bar\u012bn.* Both have scales, and in appearance and shape are like each other. Everyone cannot at once distinguish between them. The difference in their flesh also is very small, but the connoisseur discovers that the flesh of the roh\u016b is rather more agreeable of the two.\n\n* The MSS. have either bar\u012bn or par\u012bn. I cannot find the name in the dictionaries, but my friend Sir K. C. Gupta suggests that the word may be b\u0101ns (Labeo calbasu). This fish is also a carp, and resembles the roh\u016b (L. rohita), but is smaller. It may also be the catla.\nTHE NINETEENTH\nNEW YEAR'S FEAST AFTER THE\nAUSPICIOUS ACCESSION\n\nOn Wednesday, the 29th Jum\u0101d\u0101-l-awwal, A.H. 1033,\nMarch 10, 1624, after one watch and two gharis of day had\npassed, the sun, that bestows bounty on the world, passed into\nits house of honour in Aries. The royal servants obtained\npromotions and increase of mansab. A\u1e25sanu-llah, s. Khw\u0101ja\nAb\u016b-l-\u1e24asan, received as original and increase that of 1,000\nand 300 horse. Mu\u1e25ammad Sa\u02bfid; s. A\u1e25mad Beg K. K\u0101bul\u012b,\nthe same, M\u012br Sharaf Diw\u0101n-i-buy\u016bt\u0101t, and Khaw\u0101\u1e63\u1e63 K., each\nof them that of 1,000. Sard\u0101r K., having come from Kangra,\nhad the good fortune to pay his respects. At this time I gave\norders to the yas\u0101wuls and men of the yas\u0101q (guards) that\nhereafter at the time when I came out of the palace they\nshould keep away defective people, such as the blind, and\nthose whose noses and ears had been cut off, the leprous and\nthe maimed, and all kinds of sick people, and not permit them\nto be seen. On the 19th the feast of the culmination was\nheld. Il\u0101h-wird\u012b, the brother of Im\u0101m-wird\u012b, had run away\nfrom B\u012b-daulat and came to Court, and was honoured with\ngreat favours.\n\nAs the news of B\u012b-daulat\u2019s coming to the border of Orissa\nwas constantly repeated, a farman was issued to the prince\nand Mah\u0101bat K. and the Amirs who had been sent to the\nsupport of my son, that they should set their minds at ease\nabout the administering the provinces (of the Deccan), and\ngo quickly to Allahabad and Behar, and if the Subahdar of\nBengal could not forestall him, and he should put forward the\nfoot of audacity, he must be made a wanderer in the desert\nof disappointment by the blows of the victorious army which is in the shadow of the flag of my son. By way of precaution on the 2nd Urdibihisht I gave my son Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n leave to proceed to Agra to remain in that neighbourhood and wait for a sign. If there should happen to be any necessity for a particular service and an order should be given him, he must act as occasion might require. I sent him a special dress of honour, with a n\u0101dir\u012b with pearl buttons, a special jewelled sword, and to A\u1e63\u0101lat K., his son, a horse, and a dress of honour.\n\nOn this day a report came from \u2018Aqidat K., Bakhshi of the Deccan. He wrote that, according to order, my prosperous son Sh\u0101h Parwiz had married the sister of R\u0101ja Gaj Singh. I hope that her coming will be auspicious to the State. He also wrote that, having sent for Turkum\u0101n K. from Pattan he had appointed \u2018Azizu-llah in his place. J\u0101n-sip\u0101r K., also by order, came and waited on me. When B\u012b-daulat crossed the Burhanpur river and took the road of ruin, M\u012br \u1e24us\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn, considering his own evil deeds, could not remain at Burhanpur. Taking his children with him, he conveyed the goods of ruin to the Deccan, in order that he might pass his days under the protection of \u2018\u0100dil K. By chance, as he passed by B\u012br, J\u0101n-sip\u0101r K. obtained information, and sent a body of men to head him off. He seized him and his dependants, and brought them before Mah\u0101bat. Mah\u0101bat placed him in confinement, and took from him Rs. 1,00,000 in cash and goods. (Also) J\u0101do R\u0101y and \u016aday R\u0101m had taken the elephants which B\u012b-daulat had left in Burhanpur and brought them to the prince (Parwiz).\n\nQ\u0101z\u012b \u2018Abdu-l-\u2018Az\u012bz, who had come to Delhi from B\u012b-daulat in order to state his objects, had not been allowed by me an opportunity to speak and I had handed him over to Mah\u0101bat K. After his (B\u012b-daulat\u2019s) defeat and ruin Mah\u0101bat K. had made him his own servant. As he was an old friend of \u2018\u0100dil K., and was for some years at Bij\u0101p\u016br as Vakil of Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n, Mah\u0101bat K. now sent him again as his representative* to \u2018\u0100dil Khan, and the leading men of the Deccan, nolentes\n\n* Ba-rism-i-haj\u0101bat.\nvolentes, looking to the necessities of the time and the upshot of affairs, were contented and professed loyalty and desire for service. The rebel 'Ambar sent one of his confidential men of the name of 'Ali \u0160\u012br, and displayed great humility. He ('Ambar) wrote in the capacity of a servant to Mah\u0101bat K., and engaged that he ('Ambar) should come to Dewalg\u0101on* and wait upon Mah\u0101bat. He would make his eldest son a servant of the State, and keep him in the service of my auspicious son. About this time there arrived a letter from Q\u0101z\u012b 'Abdu-l-'Az\u012bz that '\u0100dil K. from the bottom of his heart had elected for service and loyalty, and agreed that he would send Mull\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad L\u0101r\u012b, who was his principal agent and minister, and whom both in spoken and written messages he called Mull\u0101 B\u0101b\u0101, with 5,000 horse, that he might remain continually on duty, and they might know that other\u2020 troops would follow (?). Urgent farmans had been sent that my son should proceed to Allahabad and Behar in order to overthrow B\u012b-daulat. At this time news arrived that notwithstanding the rainy season and the violence of the rain, that son, on the 6th Farward\u012bn had marched out of Burhanpur with the army of fortune, and had taken up his quarters in L\u0101l B\u0101gh,\u2021 and that Mah\u0101bat K. was awaiting at Burhanpur the arrival of Mull\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad L\u0101r\u012b, so that when he arrived he would relieve himself of the care of the maintenance of order in that neighbourhood, and come with him (Mu\u1e25ammad L\u0101r\u012b) to wait on my son. Lashkar K., J\u0101do R\u0101y, Uday R\u0101m, and other servants of the State had been ordered to go to the B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t (the country above the Ghats), and remain at Zafarnagar. Having given J\u0101n-sip\u0101r K. leave as before, he (Parwiz) kept Asad K. Ma'm\u016br\u012b at Elichpur. Min\u016bchihr, s. Sh\u0101h-naw\u0101z K., was appointed to J\u0101ln\u0101p\u016br. He sent R\u012bz\u0101w\u012b K. to Th\u0101lner, to guard the province of Khandesh.\n\nOn this day news came that Lashkari had taken the farman\n\n* Dewalg\u0101on is about 60 miles S. of Burhanpur, Elliot, VII. 11.\n\u2020 Or, perhaps, they might be sure he was coming shortly.\n\u2021 L\u0101l B\u0101gh was on the outskirts of Burhanpur. Though the rainy season is spoken of, the date Farward\u012bn is in March.\nto \u2018\u0100dil K., and he, having decorated the city, had gone out four koss to meet him, and had performed salutations and prostrations for the farman and the dress of honour. On the 21st I sent dresses of honour for my son D\u0101war-bakhsh and Kh\u0101n A\u2018\u1e93am and \u1e62af\u012b K. Having appointed \u0160\u0101diq K. to the government of Lahore, and given him a dress of honour and an elephant, I gave him leave. An order was given that he should have the mansab of 400 personal and 400 horse. Multafat K., s. M\u012brz\u0101 Rustam, raised the head of distinction with the mansab of 1,500 personal and 300 horse.\n\nOne day while hunting it was reported to me that a snake with a black hood (kafcha) had swallowed another hooded (kafcha?) snake and gone into a hole. I ordered them to dig up the place and bring out the snake. Without exaggeration I had never seen a snake of this size. When they opened its belly, the hood of the snake that it had swallowed came out whole. Although this snake was of another kind, in length and girth little difference was visible.\n\nAt this time it was represented to me in a report* by the news writer of the Deccan that Mah\u0101bat K. had ordered \u2018\u0100rif s. Z\u0101hid to be executed, and had put him (i.e., Z\u0101hid), with two other sons, in prison. It appeared that that wretched man had written with his own hand a petition to B\u012b-daulat representing on the part of his father and himself his loyalty, sincerity, repentance, and shame. By fate that letter fell into the hands of Mah\u0101bat K. Having sent for \u2018\u0100rif into his presence he showed him the letter. As he had written a decree for his own blood, he could not make any acceptable excuse, and of necessity he was executed, and his father and brothers imprisoned.\n\nOn the 1st Khurd\u0101d it was reported that Shaj\u0101\u2018at K. \u2018Arab, had died a natural death in the Deccan.\n\n* Perhaps the meaning is that Mah\u0101bat had imprisoned \u2018\u0100rif, the son of the Z\u0101hid whom Jahangir had condemned to death, for in the 18th year Jahangir speaks of Z\u0101hid as a rebel. But the sentence is not clear.\nAt this time a report came from Ibr\u0101h\u012bm K. Fath-jang that B\u012b-daulat had entered Orissa. The particulars of this are that between the boundary* of Orissa and the Deccan there is a barrier. On one side there are lofty mountains, and on the other swamps and a river. The ruler of Golconda had also erected a wall (dar-band) and a fort, and armed it with muskets and cannon. The passage of men by that closed route was impracticable without the leave of Qu\u1e6dbu-l-mulk. B\u012b-daulat, with the guidance of Qu\u1e6dbu-l-mulk, having passed by that route, entered the country of Orissa. It happened that at this time Ahmad Beg K., nephew of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm K., had attacked the Zamindars of Khurda. At this strange occurrence, which happened without precedent or news or information, he became confused and bewildered and without seeing a remedy gave up his campaign, and came to the village of Bulbuli\u2020 (Pipli), the seat of the governor of that Subah (Orissa). He then took his women with him and hastened to Cuttack, which is 12 koss from Pipli towards Bengal. As the time was short, he had not leisure to collect troops and arrange his affairs. He did not feel himself equal to a war with B\u012b-daulat, and he had not with him associates such as were necessary, so he went on from Cuttack to Bardwan, of which \u0160\u0101li\u1e25, nephew of \u0100\u1e63af K. deceased, was the Jagirdar.\n\n* Elliot, VI. 390. It seems probable that this is the place mentioned in the Ma\u02be\u0101\u0161iru-l-umar\u0101, I. 410, in the biography of B\u0101qir K. Najm \u0160\u0101n\u012b, and also in the P\u0101d\u012bsh\u0101h-n\u0101ma, I. 333. It is called there \u201cthe Pass of Chhatar Diw\u0101r,\u201d and is described as the boundary between Orissa and Telingana, and is two koss from Khairap\u0101ra. One Mans\u016br, a servant of Qu\u1e6dbu-l-mulk, had built a fort there, and called it Mans\u016br-garh.\n\n\u2020 Bulbuli. I had supposed this to be Pipli, but the latter place is in the Balasore district, and nearer Bengal than Cuttack. Curiously enough Pipli or Pippli is not given in the I.G. new ed., though it is given as Pippli in the old. There is also a Pipli in the Puri district (I.G., new ed., XX. 404). In the Ma\u02be\u0101\u0161iru-l-umar\u0101, I. 137 and 194, in the biographies of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Fath K. and Ahmad Beg, the place is taken to be Pipli. It is also Pipli in the Iqb\u0101l-n\u0101ma, 217, where also Cuttack is described as being 12 koss off, towards Bengal. The maps show a Pipalgaon between Puri and Cuttack, and about 30 m. from the latter place. A Pipli in the Puri district is mentioned in the I.G., new ed.\nAt first \u015e\u00e2lih was astonished*, and did not believe that Bi-\ndaulat was coming, until a letter came from La'natu-llah to\nconciliate him. \u015e\u00e2lih fortified Bardwan and remained in it.\nIbr\u00e2him K. was surprised on hearing the terrible news.\nThough most of his auxiliaries and soldiers were scattered in\nthe villages round about and unprocurable, he yet planted the\nfoot of courage firmly in Akbarnagar (Rajmahal), and set\nhimself to strengthen the fort and collect troops, and en-\ncourage the heads of tribes and retainers. He prepared the\nthings necessary for his guns and other weapons and for\nbattle. In the meanwhile a notice came to him from Bi-\ndaulat that by the decree of God and the ordinances of heaven\nwhat was not suitable to him had appeared from the womb\nof non-existence. By the revolving of crooked-moving time\nand the changes of night and day his passage towards these\nregions had come to pass. Although to the view of manly\ncourage the extent and breadth of that country were not more\nthan an exercising-ground, or rather than a rubbish-heap\n(pur-k\u00e2h\u00ee, \u201cfull of straw\u201d), and his aims were higher, yet\nas he had to pass by this way, he could not pass for nothing.\nIf it were Ibr\u00e2him\u2019s determination to go to the royal Court,\nhe (Sh\u00e2h Jah\u00e2n) would hold back the hand of injury from\nhim and his family, and he might go to Court with an easy\nmind. If he considered it advisable to stay, he would bestow\nupon him any corner of the country he might ask for.\n\n* Text isti'd\u00e2d, but the true reading is istib'\u00e2d.

The rest, up to the end of the\nbook, is written by Mu\u1e25ammad H\u0101d\u012b from some trustworthy\nMS. collected together to complete the book.\nADDENDUM\n\nMr. Berthold Laufer's paper on \"Walrus and Narwhal Ivory,\" reprinted at Leyden, 1913, from the *Toung Pao*, throws light on Jah\u0101ng\u012br's remarks about fish-tooth dagger-hilts. It now seems certain that they were made of the canine tooth of the walrus, or the horn of the narwhal. Possibly one reason why Jah\u0101ng\u012br attached so much value to the fish-teeth was because they were supposed to be an antidote to poison. He was fond of such things, and one day, when he was heir-apparent, Father Jerome Xavier found him engaged at Fathp\u016br in extracting copper from peacocks' tails, on account of its supposed antitoxine properties.\n\nIt is stated in Mr. Laufer's paper, pp. 13 and 15, that walrus-teeth were supposed to be also useful in reducing swellings. As they were often made into knife-handles, it is not improbable that the knife which a Rajah of Cochin appears to have sent to Akbar in 1569 (*Akbar-n\u0101ma*, i. 342) was, wholly or in part, made of walrus ivory. The Rajah said that whenever it was applied to a swelling it reduced it, and Akbar told Ab\u016b-l-Fa\u017cl that over 200 persons had benefited by touching it.\n\nIn the British Museum there is a fascinating set of chessmen made of walrus or narwhal ivory. They were discovered in the island of Lewis in 1831, but are supposed to be as old as the twelfth century.\nINDEX\n\nA\n\n'Abb\u0101s I., Sh\u0101h of Persia, his letter to J., 2; favours M\u012br Jumla Mu\u1e25.
