VON M\u00d6LLENDORFF.\n\nSince the appearance of the \"Elementa linguae tartario-mantchuriae\" in Th\u00e9venot's Relation de diverses voyages, Vol. III (1696), a European literature of considerable dimensions has been published on Manchu. The missionaries of the 17th century, who spoke Manchu at Kienlung's court, transmitted original Manchu works and translations to Europe, and everything known of the Manchu language and literature up to the beginning of this century originated either directly or indirectly with them. Klaproth, and especially H. C. von der Gabelentz, are alone in having undertaken new and independent researches.\n\nP\u00e8re Amiot and his colleagues in their works reported that the language was infinitely easier to acquire than Chinese, that the principal works in Chinese literature were translated into Manchu, and that therefore a knowledge of Manchu opened an easy access to Chinese literature. Langl\u00e8s, whose knowledge of Manchu was limited, frequently repeated these remarks of the missionaries (Alphabet mandchou, 3rd edition, preface p. viii, p. 3, etc.); subsequently, Klaproth, in his M\u00e9moires relatives \u00e0 l'Asie, Vol. III, p. 7 sqq., published the Lettres sur la litt\u00e9rature mandchou, traduites du Russe de M. A. L. L\u00e9ontiev, in which he contradicted the missionaries and Langl\u00e8s, without, however, being able to give anything positive himself.\n\n1 The editor of Amiot's Dictionary.\nNobody has as yet tried to give a description of the Manchu literature, and while undertaking the task myself, I feel conscious how defective this first essay must be.\n\nThe following notes will serve to indicate the sources from which I have drawn my information:\u2014In the introduction to his translation of the *Ts'ing-w\u00e9n k'i-mung* (Shanghai, 1855), A. Wylie has compiled a list of 69 works, unfortunately without any reference whatever. Klapproth's *Verzeichniss der chinesischen und mandschuischen B\u00fccher*, etc. (Paris, 1822), describes the twelve Manchu works in the Berlin Library, to which Prof. Schott, in his *Verzeichniss*, 1840, has added two others. A manuscript catalogue of the Library of the Imperial Russian Legation at Peking shows 62 works. Further, we find 61 Manchu works mentioned in the Catalogue of the Library of the Asiatic Department in St. Petersburg; others are given in the auction catalogues of the libraries of Langl\u00e8s (1825), Klapproth (1839) and Thonnelier (1880). Tr\u00fcbner's *Am. and Oriental Record* and the catalogues of Messrs. Maisonneuve and Leclerc, in Paris, contain the titles of some Manchu works, with prices. Bibliographical notes are found in G. von der Gabelentz's \"Anzeige,\" *Zeitschr. der D. Morg. Ges.* XVI, p. 540; in the *\u6eff\u5dde\u540d\u81e3\u50b3* (*Man-chou-ming-ch'en-chuan*), Vol. III, fol. 21 sqq., Vol. VIII, fol. 28 sqq.; in the *\u6771\u83ef\u9304* (*Tung-hua-lu*), Vol. I, fol. 22, Vol. III, fol. 3; and in the prefaces of some of the Manchu works. Besides my own library, I have had occasion to consult several private collections in Peking, and during repeated visits to the capital have hunted through the bookstalls and visited the fair at the \u9686\u798f\u5bfa (*Lung-fu-ssu*), where I inspected all the Manchu books I could find. In all, I have noted 249 works, which\n\n---\n\n1 See also his letter in *Zeitschr. der D. Morg. Ges.*, XIX, p. 303.\n2 See Bastian, *Die V\u00f6lker des Oestl. Asiens*, Vol. VI, p. 81.\nrepresent the literature in Manchu, classed in the following way:\n\n| No. of Works |\n|--------------|\n| 1.\u2014Aids for learning the language, dialogues, etc. | 29 |\n| 2.\u2014Dictionaries | 17 |\n| 3.\u2014The canonical books | 23 |\n| 4.\u2014Philosophy, ethics, essays, etc. | 47 |\n| 5.\u2014Religion | 25 |\n| 6.\u2014History, geography | 26 |\n| 7.\u2014Laws, edicts, treaties, regulations | 53 |\n| 8.\u2014Military sciences | 6 |\n| 9.\u2014Mathematics, medicine | 6 |\n| 10.\u2014Novels, poetry, etc. | 17 |\n\nTotal ... 249\n\nOf these works\u2014\n\nThe Library of the Imperial Russian Legation at Peking possesses ... ... ... ... 62\nThe St. Petersburg Library possesses ... ... ... ... 61\nThe Berlin Library possesses ... ... ... ... 14\n\nNothing is known of Manchu works in the public libraries of Paris and London, excepting occasional remarks in Julien's works, and the price lists in Tr\u00fcbner's Record and the catalogues of Maisonneuve Fr\u00e8res and Ch. Leclerc in Paris. But few will be added to the above number. Some older work might be found, especially in Palace editions, of which little is known. New works are not to be expected. At present scarcely anyone speaks Manchu at Peking, and the language is learned only by those who intend to enter official service as interpreters. But even these just learn enough to be able to translate documents to be laid before the\nemperor. In official phraseology these men are well versed, but rarely one of them takes any interest in other than official work. Within the Imperial family, a merely artificial knowledge of Manchu is kept up by introducing servants, and especially amahs, from Kirin into the palace.\n\nThe beginning of Manchu literature dates from 1599. In that year the Manchu chief Nurhacu (drinker), who from 1616\u201327 called himself emperor, under the title of reign of \u5929\u547d (T'ien-ming), M. Akhai fulingga (heavenly decree), gave orders to adapt the Mongol letters to the Manchu pronunciation. The officials Erdeni and Hokai carried out this imperial order, and the alphabet proposed by them was improved by Dahai. The latter then received instructions to translate into Manchu the \u660e\u6703\u5178 (Ming-hui-tien), the statutes of the Ming dynasty, the \u7d20\u66f8 (Su-shu), and the \u4e09\u7565 (San-luo). Dahai finished these translations in 1632, under the second emperor, whose title of reign was \u5929\u8070 (T'ien-tsung), M. Sure han (heavenly intelligence, the intelligent emperor). Dahai died in the year 1633, and left unfinished translations of the \u901a\u9451 (T'ung-chien), general history (printed 1665); \u516d\u97dc (Liu-t'ao), the six military rules; \u5b5f\u5b50 (Meng-tzu), the philosopher Mencius (printed 1677); the \u4e09\u570b\u5fd7 (San-kuo-chih), the records of the three Kingdoms (printed 1646); and the \u5927\u4e58\u7d93 (Ta-ch'eng-ching), the (Buddhist) book of the great development. To his colleagues Erdeni and Hokai we find no translations attributed.\n\n---\n\n4 Canonised as \u592a\u7956\u9ad8\u7687\u5e1d (Tai-tsu-hao huang-ti), M. Taidsu dergi h\u016bwangdi (great ancestor, high emperor).\n\n5 Ming-ch'\u00ean-chuan, Vol. VIII, fol. 28-30.\n\n6 Tung-hua-lu, Vol. I, fol. 22; Ming-ch'\u00ean-chuan, Vol. III, fol. 21.\n\n7 Canonised as \u592a\u5b97\u6587\u7687\u5e1d (Tai-tsung wen huang-ti), M. Taidzung genggingen h\u016bwangdi (the great founder, the serene emperor).\n\n8 Ming-ch'\u00ean-chuan, Vol. III, fol. 21.\nIn the year 1634 the emperor decreed the institution of examinations in Manchu. The Manchu dynasty in China begins in 1644 with the emperor Shunzhi, and with the settling of the Manchus commences their more intimate contact with the rich literature of China. Up to 1662, the year of Kanghi\u2019s accession to the throne, we find, besides the eight translations of Dahai already mentioned, the History of the Liao and the Kin (1644), of the Yuen (1646), the \u5927\u6e05\u5f8b\u4f8b (Ta-ch'ing la-li), or Penal Laws (1644), the Instructions of Hung-wu (1646), the Instructions of T'ien-ming, the \u4e09\u7687\u5e1d\u8056\u8a13 (San-huang-ti-sheng-hsin), the Sage Instructions of the Three Emperors (1739), and several minor works; altogether, 18 publications.\n\nThe great Kanghi (1662\u20131723) took special care of his mother tongue, and ordered translations and dictionaries to be prepared. He himself, however, wrote much Chinese, to emulate the learned of China. In his reign were published the beautiful editions of the \u53e4\u6587\u9078\u96c6 (Ku-wen yuan-chien), a collection of standard essays; the \u901a\u9451\u7de8\u76ee (T'ung-chien kang-mu), the history of China, by Ssu-ma Kuang; the \u6027\u7406\u7cbe\u7fa9 (Hsing-li-ching-i), an abstract of the metaphysical writings of the Sung scholars; the canonical books, and the Manchu national dictionary, explained in Manchu. In all, 41 works were printed during his reign. But already under his successor, the energetic Yungch\u00eang (1723\u201336), it was seen that not only was the Manchu language not accepted by any Chinese, but the Manchus themselves were forgetting their language, and were gradually being merged into the Chinese population. The emperor in his edicts made it an obligation for all Bannermen to learn Manchu, in order to preserve the language; but in vain. Only 17 works appeared during his period.\n\n*Tung-hua-ju, Vol. III, fol. 3.*\nThe able Kienlung (1736\u201396) continued the work of his predecessors, and himself took an active part in the publications called forth by him. The great Mirror of the Manchu language, the polyglot dictionaries, and the enormous Buddhistic polyglot (in Chinese, Manchu, Mongol and Thibetan) are the principal of the 69 works which appeared under this emperor. The remaining 80 works occupy the period from 1796 till now, and comprise all those in three languages (Chinese, Manchu, Mongol, \u4e09\u5408 (San ho), M. Ilan hacin i kamcibuha).\n\nUnder the first three emperors, when Manchu was still spoken, only the Manchu text was published. Such editions cease under Kienlung, and give place to bilingual prints, \u5408\u58c1 (Hopi), \u6ee1\u6f22 (Man han), M. Manju nikan hergen kamciha or Manju nikan hergen i kamcihe suhe.\n\nAll Manchu works are printed at Peking. Nearly all are translations of Chinese originals; the few works originally written in Manchu contain entirely Chinese conceptions.\n\nAfter each work enumerated below I have added the library or place where, according to my knowledge, a copy exists. Berlin, means the Royal Library in Berlin; Paris, either the house of MAISONNEUVE or one of the great libraries; Peking, the Imperial Russian Legation; St. Petersburg, the library there; v.d.G., Prof. VON DER GABELENTZ, in Leipzig; v.M., my own library.\n\nI.\u2014Aids for Learning the Language, Dialogues, etc.\n\n1.\u2014\u6e05\u6587\u555f\u8499 (Ch'ing-w\u00ean chi-i-m\u00eang), M.

The work (the only Manchu grammar, therefore the best; see Klapproth, Verzeichn., p. 121) contains a Manchu-Chinese preface, and in Vol. I the syllabary, with rules for pronouncing and writing; in Vol. II, Manchu-Chinese dialogues; in Vol. III, all affixes (de, be, i, ni,\nger, go, ge, ningye, etc.), altogether 254 articles, with examples\u2014the real grammar; in Vol. IV, a list of words similarly written, like aga and aha, menggun and munggun, and a list of synonyms, like bithe and hergen.\n\nVide R\u00c9MUSAT, Recherches sur les langues tartares, Vol. I, p. 99; G.

In western countries modern legislation has done much to reduce irregularity to order, though even there the old special units still linger on in common usage. In China some spasmodic efforts have been made from time to time to secure uniformity, but they have never gained much support, and, as will be seen from the following tables, chaos reigns supreme through the whole of the Empire. In many of the following contributions reference is made to the difficulty of finding any standard, even local.\n\nAn apology is due to the various contributors to this inquiry for not printing their papers as received; it is hoped, however, that they will recognise the utility of presenting the information in summarised tables, rather than giving detached information under all heads for each place. Where any contributor has given special information, it has been appended in the shape of notes under the proper head.\n\nI have not attempted to prepare any general summaries. The reason for this will be obvious, when, on referring to the tables, it is remarked that many provinces are unrepresented, many others only covered at a few points, and two only (Kansu and Kiangsu, the latter fairly completely) are adequately reported on. The apathy of the mercantile residents in China on this subject, which so closely affects their interests, is remarkable, not one paper having been\nreceived from any member of that influential body; and were it not for the efforts on their behalf made by the missionaries, Catholic and Protestant, this inquiry would have had no result.\n\nAn earnest appeal is made to all residents in China, whether members of the Society or not, to contribute further information on this important subject. There are three points to be kept in view:\n\n1\u00b0.\u2014To check and (if wrong) rectify the statements made in the tables now submitted;\n\n2\u00b0.\u2014To send full information on the lines of this paper regarding places not now reported on;\n\n3\u00b0.\u2014To thus collect the material for an intelligent summary of the Currency and Measures of China by some competent hand.\n\nThe paper now presented is only preliminary, and it is hoped that the Society may soon be enabled to publish tables covering every part of China.\n\nH. B. MORSE.\n\nPakhoi, 11th January 1890.\nCIRCULAR ON CURRENCY AND MEASURES IN CHINA.\n\nCHINA BRANCH OF THE ROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY,\nShanghai, January 1889.\n\nThe Council of the China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society are desirous of collecting information regarding the currency and measures in use in all parts of China, and request the favour of a short paper from you embodying information on the points given below. The papers when received will be summarised; and the summaries, together with the papers on which they are based, will be read at one of the open meetings of the Society, or printed in the Journal, at the discretion of the Council.\n\nThe points on which information is sought, are as follow:\n\nCurrency.\n\n1.\u2014What are the kinds of Tael (\u5169) of Silver (the Haikwan or \u95a9\u5e73 Tael excluded) known in your district?

(100 Taels = ? Dollars).\n\n7.\u2014What kinds of Copper Cash are used in your district?

Notes on Overland Trip from Macao to Hainan.\nNOTE BY DR. MACGOWAN\n\nON THE METROLOGY OF CHINA.\n\nUnder F. Williams, in remarking on its variations, ranging from three to twenty-one taels, the highest being the weight by which coal is sold in Honan, and the lowest being the catty of tea in Peking, justly ascribes the discrepancies to \"an effort to equalise an apparent price at the expense of the quantity given.\"\n\nIt cannot be said that the Imperial Government has failed in duty in the important function of providing standard weights and measures. More than two score centuries ago (2255 B.C.) that duty was discharged by the illustrious Shun, who rectified balances and co-ordinated weights and measures; successive dynasties have enacted statutory regulations to prevent metrological anarchy, but, as we see, they have been impotent in attempting their enforcement.\n\nMetrological Policing.\u2014No supervision is exercised by the Mandarinate in respect of weights and measures; statutable measures exist in the yam\u00ean, to which those in use by the people more or less correspond, the people in this as in commercial and municipal affairs being guided by rules of their own\u2014consuetudinal law enforced by guilds generally or by extemporized organizations.\n\nIn the all-important matter of rice measuring, public vigilance suffices in most cities\u2014as Wenchow, for example\u2014to maintain uniformity. So well do the consumers of this\ncomestible know how many bowls of rice a given measure should contain, that the least fraud would be detected and the dealer lose custom\u2014a matter that never happens.\n\nIn larger cities, however, for example as at Ningpo, rice-guilds exercise strict control over all rice-dealers, each one being obliged to be a member of the Association, among whom attempts at fraud are easily detected and the guilty are severely mulcted. Semi-monthly every dealer is required to send his measures to the guild to be tested. Care is taken to provide against the expansion and shrinkage which is consequent on the hygroscopic condition of the season, chunam being added or removed from the corners of the measure so as to adapt it to atmospheric vicissitudes; measures not taken for the public weal, but that dealers shall be able to obtain advantage over their fellow-tradesmen.\nGOLD.\n\nRev. P. Hoang (1) states:\n\nGold ingots are not in common use in trade, but only for hoarding. Hoarded gold is generally in one of two forms. One is in ingots shaped like a small boat, about 0.09 m\u00e8tre [3.6 inches] long, 0.02 m\u00e8tre [0.8 inch] wide, and weighing 360 grammes [5,555 grains = 11.575 oz. troy]; this is called \u91d1\u689d. The other is in the form of gold-leaf, measuring about 0.2 m\u00e8tre [8 inches] square, and weighing about 30 grammes [463 grains]; this gold-leaf is called \u91d1\u8449\u5b50. The unit of value of gold is called \u6362; e.g., if one ounce of gold is worth eighteen ounces of silver, it is quoted \u5341\u516b\u9280\u63db. The relative value of gold to silver was in the beginning of the Ming dynasty (1375) four times greater; under the Emperor Wan-li (1574) of the same dynasty, seven to eight times greater; at the end of the Ming dynasty (1635) ten times; under the Emperor Kang-hsi (1662) of the present dynasty, ten and more times; under the Emperor Kien-lung (1737) twenty times and more; in the middle of the reign of Tao-Kwang (1840) eighteen times; at the beginning of the reign of Hien-fung (1850) fourteen times; and at present (1882) generally eighteen times.\n\nRev. G. Parker (7) states:\n\nA liang of gold is worth [in Kansu] 17\u00bd liang of silver. When the late Governor Tan was superseded, he required such a quantity of gold that the price rose to 21\u00bd, or 4 liang above the normal price.\nDr. S. P. Barchet (16) states:\n\nGold is now seldom found in silver, since the natives have learned the wet process of extracting it.\n| Province | Prefecture | Town | Authority | Name of Ta\u00ebl | Weight of

Parker (7) states:\u2014\nOur remittances from Hankow are received in King-p'ing, and weigh in the street shops nearly three per cent more. The discrepancy of one or two mace is caused by the two slight squeezes at Bank and Cash-shop. The reason for the use of the King-yang scale at Lan-chou is that King-\nyang in Shensi (but since the Mahommedan rebellion San-yuen \u4e09\u539f\u7e23) is the chief commercial centre in the north-west. The Lan-chon silver, in the shape of \"fowls' kidneys,\" is melted at the Pu-ch\u00eang-ss\u00fc Yam\u00ean and is considered the very worst in use; old lumps and Szechuen silver are better; silver from Honan is the best. In re-casting the silver after former alloy has been removed, three per cent copper is added to ninety-seven per cent purified silver to make one hundred Taels. At Chi'in-chou \u79e6\u5dde, the chief city in the south-east of the Province (Kansn) this quality is difficult to change except at a loss.\n\nNote 4.\u2014Rev. C. F. Hogg (22) states:\n\n\u6eec\u5e02\u5e73 (called Ching-pu-ping. Pu\u2014\u5e03?)\n\nThis scale takes its name from \u6eec\u967d\u7e23 in \u965d\u897f, which was formerly the commercial capital of the province, but after its sack during the Mahommedan rebellion, the business was transferred to \u4e09\u539f\u7e23. The latter city is the great wholesale mart for the north-western provinces. The Ching-yang scale is in ordinary use there and is also used by bankers in Kan-su and Shen-si and perhaps elsewhere. Drafts drawn in Hankow on Si-ngan and Lan-chou banks are written in this scale, though the currency of both these cities differs considerably from it.\n\nNote 5.\u2014Mgr. Hameb (6) states:\n\nLa balance de Lan-tcheon a une diff\u00e9rence avec le Scen-con-fa \u7533\u516c\u781d de 24 par mille; 1,000 Tls. Scen-con-fa est 1,024 \u00e0 Lan-tcheon.\n\nNote 6.\u2014Rev. E. T. Williams (17) states:\n\n1.\u2014The Tael.\n\nThere are three kinds of Tael commonly used in Nankin: the \"K'n-p'ing,\" known also as \"S\u00fceh-hwa Yin\" (\u96ea\u82b1\u9280),\nthe \"Ts'ao-p'ing\" (\u9285\u5e73), called \"Wan Yin\" (\u7d0b\u9280) and the \"Siang-p'ing\" (\u6e58\u5e73) or \"Ti-ch'ao Yin\" (\u5eec\u6f6e\u9280).\n\nAs a matter of fact, however, these are three methods of reckoning rather than three kinds of Tael. The \"Ts'ao-p'ing\" is the standard and the Tael commonly used in Nanking. In \"Ts'ao-ping\" 100 Taels are 100 Taels, but if a transaction is conducted in \"K'u-p'ing,\" to every 100 Taels 2 Taels must be added; that is, 100 \"K'u-ping\" Taels are equal to 102 \"Ts'ao-ping.\" 100 \"Siang-ping\" are but 98 \"Ts'ao-ping.\" The \"Ts'ao-ping\" Tael contains 563.72 grains. The \"Siang-ping\" is used in paying the army and the prizes awarded students at the semi-monthly examinations, although the latter are supposed to be paid in \"K'u-p'ing\" Taels. My Chinese teacher says, it is a common saying among students that the prizes are awarded in \"K'u-p'ing,\" the examining official pays them in \"Ts'ao-p'ing,\" the minor officials distribute them in \"Siang-p'ing,\" and by the time it reaches the student the Tael has become a Mexican dollar, which, on being exchanged, is found to be bad.\n\nI have not been able to discover the fineness of the various kinds of silver or the number of grains of pure silver in each Tael. To every such question the bankers I have asked answer that they do not know. They determine the relative value by touch and colour, but say there is no established ratio. No doubt they are wrong, but I have not been able to push my inquiries farther.\n\nA Mexican Dollar by weight is said to be .74 Tael, but it does not of course exchange at this rate. At present it is worth but .68 Tael. A hundred Taels are equal to 146.86 Dollars.\n2.\u2014Cash.\n\nAll the Cash used in this region are of one denomination\u2014about $\\frac{1}{1500}$ of a Tael; but there is a large quantity of bad Cash and small Cash in circulation.\n\nA Tiao consists of 10 strings or 974 good Cash reckoned as 1,000. Each string contains nominally 100, but in reality only 98 or 95. The 95 Cash string is called a \"Ti-tsz,\" (\u5ead\u5b50) and is indicated by a knot on the end of the string. In every Tiao there are two \"Ti-tsz.\" In three strings or more one may be a \"Ti-tsz;\" in seven or more two \"Ti-tsz\" are allowed.\n\nOn every string of good Cash there may be two or three small Cash or counterfeit Cash,\u2014as a matter of fact, there are many more.\n\nThese spurious Cash are called by various names: \"Ts'ing-pau\" (\u9752\u677f), \"Hiao-p'ien-p'ien\" (\u56c2\u7247\u7247), \"Shui-shang-p'iao\" (\u6c34 \u4e0a\u98d8), a light, thin variety, said to float on water, the \"Sha-tsz-tsz\" (\u6c99\u5b50\u5b50,) which contains a great deal of sand, and the \"Ngo-yen\" (\u6211\u773c) in which the hole is very large and the coin very small. This is not to be confounded with an ancient coin of the same name. Other names are: \"Sui-tsz-tien\" (\u788e\u94b1) and \"L\u00fc-chou-kw'an\" (\u5eec\u6d32\u5bec), so-called because much of this counterfeit Cash was formerly made at a place of this name in Anhwei.\n\nThere is still another variety of small Cash, known as \"Hung-tsz-tien\" (\u7d05\u9322), because made of red copper. It is of ancient manufacture, and, although spurious, passes as good coin, on account of the quality of the copper. As many as five of this variety may be found on each string.\n\nA Mexican Dollar exchanges for 1,030 good Cash in summer and 1,080 in winter. A Tael exchanges for from 1,500 to 1,600.\nThere are strings, however, known as \"Yih-kiu-tih\" (\u4e00\u4e5d\u7684), \"Rh-pah-tih\" (\u4e8c\u516b\u7684) and \"San-ts'ih-tih\" (\u4e09\u4e03\u7684), containing 10, 20 or 30 small to 90, 80 or 70 large Cash. One can, of course, exchange at a much higher rate for this sort of Cash.\n\nAt the pawn-shops a Tiao is 1,000 in reality as well as nominally. No shortage is allowed. This is true, too, in the payment of taxes and of bank discount.\n\nI presume it was not your purpose to inquire as to the dates of the coins or the inscriptions they bear. There is great variety in this respect, though most of the Cash belongs to the present dynasty, by far the larger part bearing the style of Kien-lung (\u4e7e\u9686). It is quite common, however, to find coins of the Sung dynasty, and there are many varieties issued by old-time rebel kings. It seems strange to a foreigner to find coins two hundred years old in general circulation, but to be able to handle coins of the tenth century in this matter-of-fact way is simply marvellous. To the Chinese collector, of course, with his coins of two thousand years ago, these seem quite modern. Most of the light, thin cash mentioned above as the \"Shui-shang-p'iao (\u6c34 \u4e0a \u98db ) bear the style \"Kwang Chung T'ning Pao,\" are of unknown date, and are said to be of foreign coinage.*\n\nIn using large quantities of these small Cash, 1,000 \"Hung Ts'ien\" best quality will pass for 900 Cash; of medium grade 1,000 are equal to 800, and of poorest quality 1,000 are reckoned but 700 good Cash. Of the \"Ts'ing-pau\" there are three grades, rated respectively at 600, 700 and 800 Cash per 1,000. There are three grades of the \"Hiao-p'tien-p'ion\" also which pass for 450, 500 and 550 per 1,000, and two grades of the \"Sha-tsz'-tsz'\" which command 400 and 500 cash per 1,000.\n\n* These are Annamite.\u2014H. B. M.\n4.\u2014Spanish Dollar.\n\nIn addition to the varieties of currency just mentioned, the Spanish Dollar is also very commonly used, its value compared with that of the Mexican Dollar being as 10 to 8, that is, 8 Spanish Dollars are equal to 10 Mexicans. The Spanish Dollar exchanges here for from 1,200 to 1,300 Cash. Going north from Nanking into the interior it is difficult to use the Mexican. Its exchange value falls as low as 900 Cash, but the Spanish Dollar is in demand in these districts.\n\n5.\u2014Hang Yin.\n\nA variety of silver used here, though for certain special purposes only, is the \"Hang Yin\" (\u676d\u9280).\n\nThis too, however, is simply a method of reckoning. A Tael of the \"Hang Yin\" is but 700 Cash. Its use seems confined to the payment of marriage and funeral directors and yam\u00ean runners.\n\nNote 7.\u2014Rev. P. Gain (11) states:\n\nVoici la valeur r\u00e9elle du Tiao dans la pr\u00e9fecture (Sui-ning):\u2014\n\n| Prefecture          | Value |\n|--------------------|-------|\n| Tong-shan-hien     | 988   |\n| Soei-ning-hien     | 994   |\n| Sou-tsien-hien     | 992   |\n| Pei-tcheou         | 992   |\n| Fang-hien          | 988   |\n| Pei-hien           | 988   |\n| Tang-shan-hien     | 992   |\n\nNote 8.\u2014Rev. P. Hoang (1) states:\n\nThe Provincial Treasurer's paying weight for the K'u-p'ing Tael is 37.32 grammes, and his receiving weight 37.42 grammes.\n\nOne Ts'ao-p'ing Tael of silver in 1736 was worth 700 copper cash, in 1780 was worth 900 cash, in 1796 was worth\n1,400 cash, in 1853 was worth 2,000 cash, and is now worth from 1,500 to 1,700 cash.\n\nTraders travelling to other regions on business usually take with them a balance \u5929\u5e73 of their own district, or a small steel-yard \u621f\u5b50, or a hundred cash previously weighed by the scales of their own district, for the purpose of comparison with the weights in vogue elsewhere.\n\nNote 9.\u2014Dr. D. J. Macgowan (18) states:\n\nTs'ao-p'ing Tael is used in markets and all ordinary transactions.\n\nK'u-p'ing Tael ,, ,, ,, paying taxes.\n\nHsiang-p'ing \u9928\u5e73 Tael ,, ,, ,, volunteers \u2014 called hsiang, because Hnpeh furnishes the greater portion of China's extemporised forces.\n\nChiang-p'ing Tael is used in dealings with Ningpo merchants.\n\nKuei-p'ing Tael (Kuei=usage) used in the Shanghai trade; the \"usage\" consists in discounting 98 taels=100.\n\nHsiang-p'ing \u9928\u5e73 Tael (Hsiang=rations) is used to pay regular troops.\n\nNote 10.\u2014Mr. E. H. Parker (21) states, respecting Foochow:\n\nThe Hsin-i-p'ing Tael is worth 2.4 per cent and the Hsiang-p'ing Tael 3.3 per cent less than the K'n-p'ing Tael. The K'u-p'ing Tael being a definite weight in avoirdupois, any one can calculate for himself the weight of the others. The Hsiang-p'ing was introduced during the Rebellion and is only used for paying the soldiers. For sales of land only, an imaginary tael, called Wen-kwang, is used, and is always worth 800 large cash; this is to guard against variations in the silver market, and has no other practical exchange significance.\nNote 11.\u2014Rev. J. C. Gibson (23) states, respecting Swatow:\u2014\n\nNo distinction is made among the various foreign dollars in circulation as to the fineness of the silver. The Japanese Yen is now the popular favourite, on account of its uniformity in weight. In small transactions it is sometimes accepted as equal to Taels 0.72 without weighing. But the Japanese Yen, Mexican, Carolus, and American trade dollars, and the French Piastre de Commerce are all taken alike by weight without distinction as to purity.\n\nIt is impossible to answer this question (No. 6) because all dollars here are chopped, and no two are alike in weight. The standard $1 Mexican = Taels 0.723 or upwards is only in use with foreigners. In native transactions the Swatow standard is $1 = Taels 0.70 according to the \u9285\u9280\u76f4\u79e4, but there is also another standard in use, called the \u5e02\u79e4, according to which Taels 0.694 is taken as one dollar. In the country, Taels 0.68 is a common standard weight for the dollar.\n\nNote 12.\u2014Rev. C. Bone (19) states, respecting Shao-chon:\u2014\n\nAt present the Tael is 994; an old scale was 992; but now those who sell pork, wood, paper and tobacco use a Tael worth only 991. If 1,000 equal pure silver, the silver in general use equals 900, and 100 must be added if it were to be melted fine, and given to the mandarins. But there is a silver said to be in use which, if 1,000 equal perfect, can be reckoned at 960, so that it will be perfect if 40 only is added. If K'np'ing is worth 100, and that is perfect, the general currency must add from 6 to 10 Taels according to its pureness.\n\nNote 13.\u2014Rev. C. Bone (19) states, respecting Hsin-hni:\u2014\n\nI have not been able to ascertain that there are any special names for the different Taels, except the perfect Tael, which is called \u8db3\u53f8\u78bc. This is the ancient Tael and the ideal. In business, Mexican dollars are used or broken dollars, and the\n\"touch\" of the silver will of course depend on the touch of the original dollars. There are however three kinds of Tael in general use, and called after the business-people among whom they obtain:\n\na. In banks, warehouses, and retail shops in which corn, oil and rice are sold, the Tael is reckoned at 997 instead of 1,000.\n\nb. The tobacconist's Tael is 998 instead of 1,000.\n\nc. In purchase of land or houses the perfect Tael \u8db3\u53f8\u78bc is used, which is 1,000 or even slightly over.\n\nAbout 10 Taels (sometimes a little more, sometimes a little less) must be added to local Taels 100 to make them equal to the Government or ideal Tael.\n\nNote 14.\u2014Mr. A. Agassiz (28) states:\n\nFrench dollars, which occasionally find their way to Lungchow from Tonkin, are worth from five to eight cash each more than the other dollars. [N.B.\u2014The weight given for the Lungchow Tael seems doubtful, but I have no means of checking it.\u2014H.B.M.]\n\nNote 15.\u2014Mr. A. P. Happen (25) states, respecting Mengtz\u00fc:\n\n(1) The sycee most current in Mengtz\u00fc is the Chieh Ting (\u89e3\u9320), more commonly known as the Pai-fang (\u724c\u574a) ingot. When laid flat on a sheet of paper and traced with a pencil, it has eight curvilinear lines\u2014a figure not unlike certain brass pieces inserted in wood to protect key-holes in foreign articles of furniture. The thickness of the ingot, at the two ends, is considerably reduced by the impression of the smelter's chop stamped on the face of it, so in that aspect of it, the ingot might be likened to Faber's double-ended erasers with the corners of the rubber worn round. The same stamp is lightly impressed on the middle section too. In weight the pieces vary from two taels up to five taels.\n(2) The Hsi ss\u00fc hsiao k'o ting (\u7d30\u7d72\u5c0f\u932b\u9296), called colloquially the Mu chi k'o (\u6bcd\u96de\u932b), is a small ingot weighing from a few mace up to nearly two taels. In shape it is like a narrow oblong cup with spiral lines on the top, not unlike the lines in the skin of the fleshy part of the human thumb.\n\n(3) In shape like No. 2, but purer in the quality of the silver, and cast in ingots of five taels and fifty taels weight, is the Hsi ss\u00fc hsiao pao yin (\u7d30\u7d72\u5c0f\u5bf6\u9280), called also the Lao ts'ao wen yin (\u8001\u69fd\u679a\u9280). These two kinds of sycee have a limited circulation in M\u00eangtzi\u00fa, but they are known throughout the province. The latter is much sought after by the aborigines because of its purity.\n\n(4 to 6) The Ch'uan (\u5ddd) Kuang (\u5ee3) and Mo (\u58a8) ingots are seen here occasionally. The Mo ingot is Tonkinese sycee, and is so called because it resembles, in shape, a stick of India ink.\n\nAs each province has its own K'u-p'ing tael of pure silver, I give as the standard of comparison the Kwan-ping (\u95dc\u79e4). On our Kwan-ping scales, brought from Canton, Hk. taels 100=Mtz. taels 101.4775. The equivalent in value depends upon the touch of the silver. The figures, as given, are only approximate, because the scales in the city differ.\n\nMtz. Tls. 100=$153.84 when selling dollars, but only $142.85 when buying them. In other words, $100.00 will only exchange for Mtz. Tls. 65.00 of Pai-fang silver when parting with them, but it will take Mtz. Tls. 70.00 to repurchase them.\n\nThe same rates are quoted for the French Tonkinese dollars, but neither they nor the Mexican are current here.\n\nNote 16.\u2014Mr. T. E. HALLIFAX (27) states of Seoul, Corea:\u2014\n\nThe only coin in currency amongst the natives is the bronze cash, and the value of this in Mexican or Japanese\ndollars varies every day, from 1,200 to 2,000 cash per dollar. Amongst the higher class of traders, the Japanese silver dollar is a favourite, while owing to having been largely taken in with spurious Mexicans by Chinese adventurers, the Mexican dollar is looked upon with great suspicion and disfavour, and is consequently most difficult to pass. Chinese sycee is also current in Corea, but the precise value in exchange is difficult to state, owing to the variation in the value of cash. Very recently Japanese Bank notes and Government notes have come into favour among the higher class of Corean merchants in Seoul and the ports only. Some time ago the Corean Mint succeeded in coining a few Corean silver dollars, but these first specimens (a few thousand) went into the Palace, probably for ornaments for the King's wives, and then the coining was stopped. So that at present we have in Corea as native coins only the common cash, and as a foreign medium, Japanese silver dollars and paper money. Mexican dollars are now rarely seen. Eight or ten years ago the Corean Government coined a limited quantity of pure silver coins of three denominations, the intrinsic value of the set of three coins being about $1.10. These, however, in 1883 and 1884, were mostly bought up by the Japanese Bank, sent to Osaka, and recoined. The few remaining were bought by private individuals as curiosities.\n\nNote 17.\u2014Rev. F. P. Gilman, having recently made an overland trip from Macao to Hainan, through Yan-ping, Yeong-kong, Tin-pak, Mui-luk, Liu-chow, crossing the straits opposite Hoihow, writes (November 1889):\n\n\"At Yeong-kong a dollar sold for only 912 cash. At Mui-luk a dollar brought 922 cash. The dollar increased in value as we neared Hainan. At Hai-on, opposite Hoihow,\"\nit was 936 cash, and at Hoihow about 960 cash. Everywhere they said the dollar had fallen in value, from 100 to 200 cash during the previous eight months.\"\n\nNote 18.\u2014Regarding Shensi and Kansu, Rev. C. F. Hogg (22) states:\n\nOnly the ordinary \u9285\u9322 in Shensi and Kansu. Sometimes \u7576\u5341 cash are found, but they are used simply as common cash. In Lanchou \u862d\u5dde a tiao is = 1,000 cash. \u4e5d\u516d\u9322 (i.e., 96 per 100), each thousand cash being short 6, \u516d\u500b\u5e95\u5b50 extra. The number of ti tsz varies with the hsien.\n\nIn Si-ngan (\u897f\u5b89\u5e9c) \u5c0d\u677f\u5152\u9322 is used, i.e., one tiao = 500 cash. In \u897f\u752f\u5e9c (Kansu) the tiao has this value.\n\nIn \u5c90\u5c71\u7e23 (Shensi) \u4e8c\u516b\u9322 is used, i.e., one tiao = 800 cash. In \u6f22\u4e2d\u5e9c (Shensi) and \u79e6\u5dde (Kansu) the tiao = 1,000 cash. The 1,000 cash tiao is known as \u8001, \u5927, or \u9285\u9322. The 500 cash tiao as \u6bdb, \u5c0f, or \u5c0d\u677f. \u6bdb and \u5c0f are sometimes used of the poorer, small cash, but they are used in this case with reference to quantity. In some other districts in Shensi (\u5bf6\u96de\u7e23, for instance) the tiao = 700 cash. The \u540a of whatever kind, is also called \u4e32.\n\nFrom experience in several provinces, I should say that the local tael averages 1,500 cash in value all the year round. In Han Chung it has sunk to 1,100 odd, and risen to close on 1,900. The demand for cash at the New Year increases its value. In Han Chung and Si-ngan the price of silver is usually between 1,500 and 1,600 cash. In Lanchou from 1,450 to 1,550. Rain, examinations, and the opium season increase the demand for cash and so raise its price.\n\nThe following note by Mr. W. S. Emens, of the U.S. Consulate-General, Shanghai, was received after the tables on pp. 58-63 were printed:\u2014\nThe name of the tael current in Shanghai is \u8ca8\u9280 or \u9280\u5143. Each tael contains .98 pure silver. Shanghai Tael 1.1114 is equivalent locally to one K'\u00fc-p'ing or Hai-kwan tael.\n\nThe relation of the Mexican Dollar to the local tael is a fluctuating one, the ratio of exchange being fixed at the \u9280\u696d\u516c\u6240 daily.\n\nThe average value of a Mexican Dollar may be put at Taels .73. The \"cash\" current at Shanghai are from the various provinces with a percentage, probably, 10 per cent, of Japanese cash.\n\nThe term tiao is not usually employed, but the word for thousand is used in its stead. In ordinary business transactions 99 cash are counted as 100. Only in a \u7576\u92ea is a full string of one hundred cash given. One Mexican Dollar buys from 1,020 to 1,200 cash, according to the market demand for one or the other.\n\nPAPER MONEY.\n\nCash notes are common in many parts of the Empire, and are extensively used from their convenience. See especially the memorials of the Governor of Kirin given in the North-China Herald, Vol. XLII, page 175, and Vol. XLIII, page 50. Silver notes, except those of the foreign banks, are not used at all. The remarks of the various contributors on this subject are abstracted as follows:\n\nSHENG-KING:\u2014Newchwang. Mr. W. B. Russell (29) states:\n\nCash notes are in circulation to the amount of about 3,000,000 tiaos or 300,000 taels. The reason why they are\nso cheerfully accepted in the market, is because they are convenient to be carried and no exchange of debased cash is to be made.\n\nNo Bank notes or cheques are used locally.\n\nCHIHLI:\u2014Peking and Tientsin:\u2014\n\nCash notes are in common use.\n\nSHANTUNG:\u2014Chi-nan-fu. Rev. G. Reid (5) states:\u2014\n\nCash notes may be used within a distance of 100 li, being accepted by salt-dealers and some of the shop-keepers. In the city they are accepted, if from reliable shops.\n\nSupposing that by \"Bank Notes\" is meant something other than \"Cash Notes,\" I would say that such are used as cheques only. In this city there are large exchange-shops, where cheques from Shanghai, Peking, and other parts of the country may be exchanged for silver, or where such cheques may be purchased for other places.\n\nSHANSI:\u2014Lu-an-fu. Rev. M. Poell (20) states:\u2014\n\nCash notes are used of denominations from 500 to 5,000 cash; they are the same as those I have seen in other provinces. Silver notes are not used.\n\nSHENSI | KANSU\n\nRev. C. P. Hogg (22) states:\u2014\n\nIn Si-ngan, paper notes, value 1,000 (i.e. 500) and 2,000 (i.e. 1,000) cash, are issued and largely used. Spurious notes are afloat in quantities, so that neighbouring money-shops are usually appealed to before the notes change hands. In Lanchou, paper notes equivalent to 1,000 cash (actual value) are largely used also.\n\nIn Han Ching, oil-cloth notes are used,\u2014value 1,000 cash. Different hsiens and large towns in this and other fus also issue\nnotes. The Han Chnng fu notes present quite a creditable appearance, are stout, of a yellowish brown color, and are oiled after signature or rather after value and cipher have been inserted; these appear to be the equivalent of the \"signature\" in Chinese bank notes. Banks sometimes shut their doors, but the notes of established houses are readily accepted without reference. Silver drafts may be given in payment for goods. They are always payable to bearer (\u8a8d\u7968\u4e0d\u8a8d\u4eba, \u7167\u7968\u767c\u9280) notwithstanding that there may be no intimation of the fact in the document itself and that the payee's name may be inserted in full. A special clause has been added at times by some of the Hankow bankers, in drafts made payable to foreigners. \u8db3\u7d0b\u9280 is interpreted relatively, the standard being the \u8857\u5e02\u9280 of the place on which the draft is drawn.\n\nRev. G. Parker (7) states:\u2014\n\nBoth oil-cloth and paper cash notes are used. No official control is exercised as to their issue.\n\nPanics sometimes occur at the closing of several money-shops. The first from swindling, others in consequence of the run on their bullion in cashing notes. For the issue of silver drafts, \u5354\u540c\u6176, \u5929\u6210\u4ea8, \u85cd\u8c50\u548c are the three Chinese bankers that have agencies in Kansu; Lanchou all three, Kanchou two, Liangchou and Suchou one each. Chinchou formerly had an office, but it has been closed since the Rebellion.\n\nMgr. F. H. Hamer (6) states, respecting Kansu:\u2014\n\nPas en usage dans la plus grande partie de la province. (Cash notes).\n\nNegative. (Silver notes).\nKiangsu:\u2014Nanking. Rev. E. T. Williams (17) states:\n\nThe use of paper money is very common in Nanking, especially of the 300, 400, 500 and 1,000 cash notes, called \"P'iao-tsz,\" (\u7968\u5b50). These are very well engraved, and printed on good, strong paper in red and blue inks. A note of ordinary size is $7\\frac{1}{2}$ inches long and $4\\frac{1}{2}$ inches wide. The design consists of a border, usually made up (largely) of human figures. One before me, as I write, has a border composed of characters and scenes from some ancient drama. Within this is a second border, consisting of an extract from the classics in very small type. Inclosed by these borders is an oblong space containing the name of the bank, its location, the value of the note, its number and date and the mark or style (\u865f) of the bank. Before being put in circulation the note must also bear the great seal of the bank upon its face. Each person too, as the note passes through his hands, adds his private mark, so that it soon becomes defaced. There are also 2,000, 5,000 and even 100,000 cash \"p'iao-tsz,\" but these are not so common. Notes for 50, 100 and 200 cash, printed upon red paper and called \"T'iao-tsz\" (\u689d\u5b50) are used at New Year, chiefly for presents to children and servants. At other times they are rarely seen. The small foreign silver pieces are slowly taking the place of these. Silver notes are used in trade, but not to any great amount. Their use is almost wholly confined to merchants in their dealings with one another.\n\nShanghai:\u2014Mr. W. S. Emens writes:\n\nCash notes or paper money promising to pay copper cash are not used in Shanghai. Mexican Dollar notes and Tael notes issued by the European Banks are used extensively by natives.\nHs\u00fc-Chou-Fu. Rev. L. Gain (11) states:\n\nLes billets de banque abondent. Les principaux bourgs en \u00e9mettent tous des diff\u00e9rents qui n'ont cours que dans un rayon assez restreint et perdent de leur valeur en passant dans une autre localit\u00e9. Ils ont la valeur nominale d'un tiao ou Tchoan, \u4e32, toujours payable en grandes sap\u00e8ques.\n\nOn ferait une belle collection des ces billets de banque, vrais petits chefs-d'\u0153uvre d'imprimerie. J'en ai plus de 50 esp\u00e8ces entre les mains.\n\nChekiang: Ningpo. Mr. T. F. Pettus (15) states:\n\nCash notes issued by firms whose credit stands high are in general use among the merchants for all amounts, and in many cases preferred to silver. When cashed a premium of $\\frac{1}{2}\\%$ is generally charged, and in some cases $1\\%$ to $2\\%$.\n\nDr. S. P. Barchet (16) states:\n\nPaper money, as a universal and unquestioned tender, is unknown in Ningpo, but wholesale dealers (e.g. fishmongers) will give notes, \u8d27\u7968, payable 10 days after issue, which are readily taken instead of money, for they can be cashed by bearer at any time. Shops also issue cash or promissory notes, but these will not be paid till they fall due (usually from 10 to 40 days). Cash notes issued by small firms are risky in proportion to the length of time before they fall due. The greatest risk is incurred where parties borrow the name and credit of other firms, issuing cash notes in their name. It often happens that when such cash notes fall due they are not even then paid in hard cash but in cash notes on somebody else and again on somebody else till the last holder finds himself the loser. It is probably owing to such experience that cash notes are endorsed or verified, and when cash notes change hands reference is made to the original party\nissuing them, to have them again verified. This involves a great loss of time and makes most people prefer cash. When it is wished to have the amount paid into a bank or other firm, a small deduction is made (from 5 to 10 cash in the dollar). Bank notes are not used otherwise than as cheques.\n\nW\u00eanchow. Dr. Macgowan (18) states:\n\nPaper money circulates to a very limited extent. Cash notes are issued by a few traders, and cheques by bankers, yet they can hardly be said to perform the function of money as a circulating medium.\n\nFukien: Foochow. Mr. E. H. Parker (21) states:\n\nCash notes or ch'ien-p'iao, \u9322\u7968, for 100, 200, 300 cash are called p'iao-t'iao, \u7968\u689d; for 400, 500, 600 they are called hsiao-p'iao, \u5c0f\u7968. There are no others but for thousands, from one to ten, called ta-p'iao, \u5927\u7968.\n\nA cheque is called chi-ch'ien, tsz-t'iao, \u652f\u9322, \u5b57\u689d. Bank notes range from one tael to two thousand taels, and are called yin-p'iao, \u9280\u7968.\n\nTaiwan: Takow. Mr. Mak Szeche (26) states:\n\nNo cash notes or paper money of any kind used here. Bank notes are not used by natives. They all use dollars in silver.\n\nKwangtung: Swatow. Mr. L. Grunauer (24) states:\n\nThere is no paper money in Swatow representing cash. Bank notes are a new invention; their use commenced certainly not before last year. The circulation is not large, and is restricted to the port.\n\nShao-chow-fu. Rev. C. Bone (19) states:\n\nBankers' cheques are used as money orders to and from the Provincial city \u7701\u57ce (Canton).\nHsin-hui. Rev. C. Bone (19) states:\n\nPaper money not used now, but said to have been used during the Ming dynasty.\n\nHongkong Bank notes are used, and will pass at par in business transactions, but if changed at a money-changer's or a bank, one fan (100 fan = 1 Leung) will be deducted.\n\nPakhoi.\u2014Paper money, Chinese or foreign, not used.\n\nKwangsi: Lungchow. Mr. A. Agassiz (28) states:\n\nCash notes and bank notes not used.\n\nYunnan: Mengtz\u00fc. Mr. A. P. Happer, jr. (25) states:\n\nThere are no cash notes in Mengtz\u00fc. There is no bank in the city.\n\nWeights.\n\n| Province | Prefecture | Town | Authority | Name or Use | Weight |\n|----------|------------|------|-----------|-------------|--------|\n|          |            |      |           |             |        |\n| Chihli   | Peking     |      |           | British Treaty | ... | 21.38 | 604.90 |\n|          | Lin-ch'ing | Chou |           | French \"     | ... | 21.32 | 604.53 |\n| Shantung | Chi-nan    | Fu   |           | 2 Tea        | ... | 4.00  | 113.41 |\n|          |            |      |           | \"Thirty-four\" | \u4e09\u5341\u56db\u7684 | 19.95 | 565.60* |\n|          |            |      |           | \"Thirty-five\" | \u4e09\u5341\u4e94\u7684 | 19.40 | 550.00* |\n|          |            |      |           | \"Thirty-six\" | \u4e09\u5341\u516d\u7684 | 18.85 | 534.50* |\n|          |            |      |           | \"Three-catty\" | \u4e09\u65a4\u79e4 | 22.00 | 623.75* |\n|          |            |      |           | \"3 catties 4 taels\" | \u4e09\u65a4\u56db\u5169\u79e4 | 20.00 | 567.10* |\n|          |            |      |           | \"3 catties 6 taels\" | \u4e09\u65a4\u516d\u5169\u79e4 | 18.70 | 530.20* |\n\n* Note 1.\n### CURRENCY AND MEASURES IN CHINA.\n\n#### Catty \u65a4\n\n| Province | Prefecture | Town | Authority | Name or Use | Weight |\n|----------|------------|------|-----------|-------------|--------|\n|          |            |      |           |             | 1 = 98.35 Ounces avoirdupois Grammes. |\n| Honan    | Nan-yang Fu | 2 Coal | ... | ... | 28.00 793.88 |\n|          | Lan-chon Fu | 7 Double catty used in wholesale and for bulky goods. | ... | ... | 40.40 1,145.50 |\n| Kansu    | Liang-chou Fn | 6 | ... | ... | 21.70 615.33* |\n| Hopeh    | Lan-ch'ing Chou | 7 | ... | ... | 21.45 608.20 |\n|          | Han-yang Hankow | 22 | ... | ... | 20.20 572.75 |\n|          | ... | 1 Ts'ao-p'ing | \u6e05\u5e73\u5929\u5e73\u79e4 | ... | 20.66 585.79 |\n|          | ... | 1 T'ang | \u5854\u79e4 | ... | 27.25 773.25 |\n| Kiang-ning (Nanking) | 17 Ts'ao-fa | \u6f22\u6cd5 | ... | ... | 20.60 601.00 |\n|          | 17 Su-fa | \u8607\u6cd5 | ... | ... | 18.55 525.90\u2020 |\n|          | 17 Oil, etc. | ... | ... | ... | 19.70 558.50\u2020 |\n| Yang-chou Hai-men | 1 Cheng-sha | \u6b63\u7d17\u79e4 | ... | ... | 25.55 724.90 |\n| Tai-tsong Tsung-ming | 1 Cheh-chuang | \u6298\u838a\u79e4 | ... | ... | 24.90 706.60 |\n| Soochow...

H. P. Perkins (4) states:\n\nThe common one [in Lin-ch'ing-chou] about which everyone knows is the catty of 16 taels, and called the thirty-five (\u4e09\u5341\u4e94\u7684), because using this catty ten strings of cash weigh 35 catties \u65a4. The cash has 49 coins for one hundred, which gives 490 coins to the tiao or string. Using my weighing pole (which is as likely to be right as any other, for I can find no standard) I find that this string of cash weighs 54 taels=65.5 U.S. oz., which gives one catty =19.41 U.S. oz. There are also at least two other catties, i.e., the 34 and 36, of which the explanation is as of the 35. I find that in the cotton hong they use the 34 (which they call the \u67b6\u5b50) for buying and the 35 for selling.\n\nRev. Gilbert Reid (5) states:\n\nIn Chi-nan-fu there are three kinds of weight for catty in common use, one called the \"three catty four tael scale\" (\u4e09\u65a4\u56db\u5169\u79e4), one the \"three catty scale\" (\u4e09\u65a4\u79e4), and the third the \"three catty six tael scale\" (\u4e09\u65a4\u516d\u5169\u79e4). These names are given by weighing one tiao [490] of the Chi-nan-\nfu cash, this being taken as a basis or standard of comparison. Of these, one catty of the first, or \"three-four\" weight, is equal to 20 ounces avoirdupois; the catty of the second, or \"three-catty\" weight, is equal to 22 ounces; and the catty of the third, or \"three-six\" weight, is equal to 18.72 ounces. The one generally used is the first named, or \"three-four\" weight.\n\n[N.B.\u2014In connection with these two notes, the fact is notable that according to the Imperial Decree of 1836 ordering new coinage of cash, the weight of the cash is one mace, and this weight was adhered to in Shantung. On this basis 10 cash weigh 1 tael, and 490 cash weigh 49 taels, equal to 3 catties 1 tael. Of what scale this was, I do not know (K'\u00fc-p'ing I suppose)\u2014and it is left to the reader to make his deductions.\u2014H.B.M.]\n\nNote 2.\u2014Mgr. Hamer (6) states:\n\nIci [Kansu] on compte pour un tan \u62c5 la charge d'une mule, 240 livres [catties]. Un char transporte 5 tan.\n\nNote 3.\u2014Rev. E. T. Williams (17) states:\n\n1. Kin.\u2014The ordinary Catty or Kin used in Nanking consists of 16 Liang (\u5169), 1 Liang being equal to 1.2885 ounces avoirdupois. This is known as \"Ts'ao Fah\" (\u66f9\u6cd5). We have also the \"Su Fah\" (\u8607\u6cd5) in which either 14.4 Liang or 15.3 Liang equal 1 kin. The \"Su Fah\" is used in buying raw cotton, metals, certain kinds of fruit and bread. Another sort of kin contains 18 Liang, and is used in sale of certain oils as the \"Ma yiu\" (\u9ebb\u6cb9) and the \"Teu yiu\" (\u8591\u6cb9) and other articles.\n\n3.\u2014The Liang.\u2014The Tael or Liang (\u5169) of commerce is identical with the Tael of currency, and although the Kin varies, the Liang remains the same.\nAdditional weights are:\n\n5 Sz' (\u7d72) = 1 Sheh (\u7dde).\nA double Sheh = 1 Shing (\u5347), not the same as the measure of capacity which is known by this character. This is used in weighing yarns.\n80 Threads (\u7e37) also equal 1 Shing or Skein.\n\n24 Scruples (\u9296) = 1 Liang.\n1.5 Liang = 1 Tsieh (\u63d0).\nDouble Tsieh = 1 K\u00fc (\u8209).\nDouble K\u00fc = 1 Ts'iang (\u93e4).\nor 1 Hwan (\u9214).\n\n6 Liang also = 1 Chw'en (\u5ddd).\n1 Great Half-ounce (\u534a\u5169) = 1 Ki\u00fcn (\u9264).\n10 Ki\u00fcn = 1 Hwan (\u9214).\n2 Hwan 4 Ki\u00fcn = 1 Kin.\n24 Liang = 1 Yih (\u93b0).\n\nMany of these weights are used only in the yam\u00ean.\n\nNote 4.\u2014Rev. P. Hoang (1) states:\n\nThis catty [Hui-kuan, or Guild catty, of 527.21 grammes] is in use in Shanghai, in the Guild House of which place is kept a mass of copper, called \u9285\u9320, the weight of which equals 122 catties of the said scale, and which serves to rectify steelyards of this scale.\n\nNote 5.\u2014Mr. E. H. Parker (21) states with respect to Foochow:\n\nThe scale of commerce is three-fourths that of the standard, for all articles but rice. The standard is the K'u-p'ing ounce of silver. Thus 100 catties of anything but rice are 75 catties weight in silver. This is called the Hung-hua-ch'\u00eang \u7d05\u82b1\u79e4, and is always used unless you ask for the standard and pay prices in proportion.\nNOTE 6.\u2014The Rev. J. C. Gibson, of Swatow (23) states:\u2014\n\nThere is a considerable variety of standards. The usual one for small transactions is the \u53f8\u99ac\u79e4 of 16 taels to the catty. For larger dealings the \u6c55\u982d\u7ba1\u79e4 is used, according to which the catty weighs 20 taels.\n\nFormerly there wore at least three standards in use by small dealers in Swatow, making the catty = 12 taels, 14 taels, and 16 taels respectively. The local petty Mandarin, a number of years ago, fixed a uniform scale of 16 taels to the catty, and provided standards for reference. This reform has fallen into abeyance and the old variety has re-appeared with more uncertainty than before as to the scale sanctioned by usage for each kind of transaction. The usage also varies in the different market-towns, and different standards are used for different classes of produce. In some scales two taels or thereby are taken as one. Thus, in the market-town of Mien-fu, \u7dbf\u6e56, 60 miles west of Swatow, I noted the following scale:\n\nFor Ducks and dried cuttle-fish, 1 Catty = 40 Taels\n,, Fowls ,, ,, = 36 ,,,\n,, Pork and salt fish ,, ,, = 32 ,,,\n,, Sweet potatoes ,, ,, = 28 ,,,\n,, Tea and tobacco ,, ,, = 18 ,,,\n,, Vegetables, charcoal & fruit ,, ,, = 16 ,,,\n,, Hemp and flax ,, ,, = 15 ,,,\n\nThis is a specimen of what holds with endless variation elsewhere.\n\nThe Picul (\u62c5) weighs 100 catties. Its weight therefore varies with that of the catty, but as the \u6c55\u982d\u7ba1\u79e4 is the usual standard for large transactions, the standard picul weighs 125 of the normal catty of 16 taels. The \u77f3 is a measure of capacity containing 10 Pecks (\u6597) and is not used as a standard of weight.\nNOTE 7.\u2014Mr. Grunauer (24) states:\n\nThere are 4 different kinds of weight used in Swatow; none is used more than the other, as each is used for a different kind of cargo or business; they are the\u2014\n\n\u6cb9\u982d\u91dd\u79e4, which is equal to 125 catties Customs weight,\ni.e., one of these piculs, if weighed on Customs scales, gives 1\u00bc picul.\n\n\u6f6d\u6797\u91dd\u79e4 on the same bases as above is 4% more.\n\u7cd6\u91dd\u79e4 ,, ,, ,, 30% \u2014\n\u51b0\u679c\u79e4 ,, ,, ,, 25% less.\n\nThis last weight is used by petty shop-keepers and is practically a squeeze.\n\nNOTE 8.\u2014Mr. A. P. Happen, Jr., (25) states:\n\nTwo catties are in use in M\u00eang-tz\u016d: one, the Hill Products (\u5c71\u8ca8) or Tavern (\u5e97) catty, for weighing cotton, fungus and certain kinds of produce, not numerous. It equals 18 M\u00eang-tz\u016d p'ing taels in weight, and is supposed, consequently, to weigh 666 grammes, but I could not obtain any exact weights.\n\nThe other catty is that of the Po-fu (\u767e\u798f), or, Canton (\u5ee3) steelyard, which is the one in common use. It should weigh 621.6 grammes.\n\nThe same steelyard is used for both kinds of catties, as there are two sets of scales marked on it.\n\nNOTE 9.\u2014The Rev. F. P Gilman states that at Yeong-kong he was informed that a catty was made up of 60 taels. At Mui-luk the catty is 20 taels.\n\nNOTE 10.\u2014The Rev. P\u00e8re Debrix states with regard to Ning-kuo-fu and Kwang-t\u00ea-chou, that the usual weight of the catty is 16 ounces, but a 14 oz. catty is employed to weigh iron, and one of 18 ounces for various other things. The Peck of dry rice contains 16 kin at Ho-li-k'i, but in other places 14\u00bd or 15 kin.\n| Province | Prefecture | Town | Authority | CONTENTS | CAPACITY

P. Hoang (1) states:\n\nThe measures in common use for measuring grain are of three kinds:\n\n1st.\u2014The Hu \u916c, which is half the Shih \u77f3, (or 5 Tou \u6597);\n2nd.\u2014The Tou \u6597, a tenth of the Shih \u77f3;\n3rd.\u2014The Sh\u00eang \u5347, a hundredth of the Shih \u77f3.\n\nThe Chih-hu \u5236\u659b, or Ts'ao-hu \u6f15\u659b, is the legal measure of capacity by which the Tribute Rice \u6f15\u7c73 is measured. By this measure one Shih \u77f3 equals about 103.1 litres [6,292 cubic inches]. That this measure may be uniform throughout the Empire, the Board of Revenue \u6237\u90e8 keeps a Hu made of iron, and sends a corresponding specimen to each official \u6f15\u7763 and \u6f15\u9053, in charge of the Tribute Rice. The District Magistrates send their wooden Hu to the \u6f15\u9053, who compare them with their iron Hu, seal them and then return them. In the 28th year of Kien-lung (1763) an attempt was made by a Censor to secure uniformity in the measures of capacity, but the innovation was reported against by the Imperial Council.\nNote 2.\u2014Rev. P. Gain (11) gives an interesting note of the price of various cereals in February, 1889, at Hs\u00fc-chou in Sui-ning-fu, Kiangsu:\n\n1 shih of rice of 280 catties, value 7,600 cash.\n1 ,, wheat ,, 260 ,, ,, 4,500 ,, \n1 ,, barley ,, 150 ,, ,, 3,200 ,, \n1 ,, rye ,, 120 ,, ,, 2,600 ,, \n1 ,, maize ,, 200 ,, ,, 4,000 ,, \n1 ,, sorghum ,, 220 ,, ,, 3,800 ,, \n1 ,, beans ,, 250 ,, ,, 3,800 ,, \n1 ,, petits pois ,, 290 ,, ,, 4,000 ,, \n1 ,, yellow peas ,, 240 ,, ,, 4,600 ,, \n1 ,, green peas ,, 260 ,, ,, 4,200 ,, \n1 ,, black peas ,, 250 ,, ,, 4,000 ,, \n1 ,, sesamum seed ,, 140 ,, ,, 5,200 ,, \n1 ,, colza ,, 180 ,, ,, 3,800 ,, \n1 ,, melon-seeds ,, 150 ,, ,, 7,000 ,, \n1 ,, ground-nuts ,, 100 ,, ,, 220 ,, \n1 ,, taro ,, 100 ,, ,, 350 ,, \n\nNote 3.\u2014Dr. S. P. Barchet (16) states:\n\nWe find considerable difference in the peck of the city and the peck used up-country. As a rule, the peck increases in size in large shops where business is done for ready cash, and decreases where the credit system prevails.\n\nNote 4.\u2014Rev. C. Bone (19) states:\n\nThe Tou, \u6597, of rice is 6.25 catties. In some cases, however, grain-selling guilds use a tou of 10 or 13 and even 14 catties.\n\nNote 5.\u2014Note on Pakhoi Tou.\n\nI have made no attempt to reconcile discrepancies. As to the Pakhoi Tou, I may say that I measured the tou in common use, and weighed on foreign scales its contents in rice.\u2014H. B.

the length a Kung, and the square of 5 Ch'ih a Pu.\n\nThe Li is theoretically 1,800 of the land foot, the length of which may be seen on reference to the Table of Area of the Mow. Practically it is usually one-tenth of an hour's march \u5834, which will vary according to the nature of the ground.\n\nNOTES.\n\nNOTE 1.\u2014Rev. P. M. Poell (20) states:\u2014\n\nThe carpenter uses a foot of 9 inches, the tailor of 10 inches, and others of 15 inches. [These are proportions only.]\n\nNOTE 2.\u2014Dr. S. P. Barchet (16) states:\u2014\n\nThe \"family\" foot is used by families for buying cloth, etc., which they sell by the \"tailor's\" foot, hence the \"family\" foot varies considerably in length.\n\nNOTE 3.\u2014Mr. E. H. Parker (21) states of Foochow:\u2014\n\nThe tailor's foot \u622a\u5c3a is 20 per cent larger than the cloth foot \u5e97\u5c3a or builder's foot \u6728\u5c3a. The official Kung \u5f13 of land is in length 5.6 of the latter. The other calculations can be made by any one.\n\nNOTE 4.\u2014Note on Pakhoi foot:\n\nThe \"standard\" foot appears to be used only in making flooring-tiles, which are exactly a \"standard\" Ch'ih square. The tailor's Ch'ih is called \"nine-seven\" \u4e5d\u4e03, and the carpenters' Ch'ih \"nine-five\" \u4e5d\u4e94, being respectively $\\frac{97}{100}$ and $\\frac{95}{100}$ of the \"standard\" Ch'ih.\u2014H.B.M.\n\nNOTE 5.\u2014Mr. Happen (25) states respecting Mengtz\u00fc:\u2014\n\nPeddlers in the country are said to carry several foot-rules with them, and when offering cloth for sale, give the prices according to the measurement of each foot.\n### Currency and Measures in China\n\n#### Mow \u576a\n\n| Province | Prefecture | Town       | Authority | Length of Kung on Pu. | Number of Pu. to Mow | Area of Mow |\n|----------|------------|------------|-----------|-----------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| Shantung | Feng-tien  | Newchwang  | 29        | 67.50                 | 240                  | 7,594       |\n|          | Lin-ch'ing | Chou       | 4         | 61.10                 | 360                  | 9,480       |\n|          |            | Fu         | 5         | 73.92                 | 360                  | 13,991      |\n|          | Chi-nan    | Lo-an      | 5         | 73.92                 | 840                  | 32,634      |\n| Honan    | Liang-chou | Fu         | 6         | 63.00                 | 240                  | 6,615       |\n|          | Nan-yang   | Fu         | 9         | 68.75                 | 240                  | 7,877       |\n|          | Ju-ning    | Fu         | 9         | 99.00                 | 240                  | 16,820      |\n| Anhui    | Ying-chou  | Huo-ch'lu  | 10        | 69.50                 | 240                  | 8,050       |\n| Kiangsu  | Kiang-ning | (Nanking)  | 17        | 62.50                 | 240                  | 6,510       |\n|          | Tal-tzang  | Tsung-ming | 1         | 67.70                 | 240                  | 7,643       |\n|          | Hsu-chou   | Sui-ning   | 11        | 70.10                 | 240                  | 8,190       |\n|          | Fu         |            | 1         | 66.50                 | 240                  | 7,430       |\n|          |            |            | 1         | 69.70                 | 240                  | 8,094       |\n|          | Sung-kiang |            | 1, 13     | 60.50                 | 240                  | 6,105       |\n|          | Shanghai   |            | 2, 3, 18  | 62.00                 | 240                  | 6,600       |\n| Chekiang | Ningpo     | Fu         | 15        | 61.25                 | 240                  | 6,252       |\n|          | W\u00ean-chow   | Fu         | 18        | 55.00                 | 240                  | 5,042       |\n\n*Note 1.*  \n\u2020 Note 2.  \n\u2021 Kung of 7.2 chih.  \n\u00a7 Note 3.  \n|| Note 4.  \n** Note 5.\n### Mow\n\n| Province | Prefecture | Town | Authority | Length of Kung or Pu | Number of Pu to Mow | Area of Mow |\n|----------|------------|------|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------|\n| Fukien   | Ch'uan-chou | Amoy | 2         | 74.00                | 1,880               | 240        | 9,138      | 848.5 |\n|          | Ch'ao-chou  | Swatow | *       | 23                   | 57.50               | 1,460      | 240        | 5,510    | 511.4 |\n| Kwangtung| Kwang-chou  | Canton | \u2020       | 19                   | 70.00               | 1,780      | 240        | 8,167    | 761.1 |\n|          | Lien-chou   | Pakhoi |       | 3                    | 50.00               | 1,270      | 240        | 4,167    | 387.1 |\n| Kwangsi  | T'ai-p'ing  | Lungchow |     | 28                   | 52.50               | 1,335      | 240        | 4,594    | 427.7 |\n| Yunnan   | Lin-an      | Mengtz\u00fc | \u2021       | 25                   | 60.05               | 1,525      | 240        | 6,000    | 558.1 |\n| Korea    |             | Fusan  | \u00a7       | 14                   | 71.20               | 1,808      | 240        | 8,449    | 784.3 |\n\n* Note 6. \u2020 Note 7. \u2021 Note 8. \u00a7 Note 9.\n\n### AREA TABLE.\n\n- 10 Hsien \u7e23 = 1 Wei \u7e41\n- 10 Wei \u7e41 = 1 Hu \u5ffd\n- 10 Hu \u5ffd = 1 Ss\u016d \u8a60\n- 10 Ss\u016d \u8a60 = {1 Hao \u6beb (0.24 Pu \u6b65)}\n- 10 Hao = 1 Li \u5ec8 (2.4 Pu)\n- 10 Li = 1 Fen \u5206 (24 Pu)\n- 10 Fen = 1 Mow \u8018 (240 Pu)\n- 100 Mow = 1 Ch'ing \u9803\n\nThe common instrument for measuring land is of this shape and proportion, measuring 5 local ch'ih = 1 kung or 1 pu; 240 square pu legally make 1 mow.\nNOTES.\n\nNOTE 1.\u2014Rev.

The mou seems to vary somewhat according to the soil. For example, outside of the South suburb gate of Chi-nan-fu the small mou is used, outside the West the next larger, and outside the East the largest. The smallest is the official standard.\n\n[N.B.\u2014The Rev. G. Reid gives the pu at 73.92 inches. It would be worth inquiring if the pu at Chi-nan-fu is not more correctly 62.81 inches English.\u2014H.B.M.]\n\nNOTE 2.\u2014Mgr. Hamer (6) states:\n\nIci [Lan-chon, Kansu] pour les terres on ne compte pas par mou mais par teou ; personne ne sait dire an juste la mesure d'un teou ; cela d\u00e9pend des terres et des endroits. Une telle terre est vendue pour autant, une autre pour autant de teou. Il me semble qu'un teou \u00e9quivale \u00e0 $2\\frac{1}{2}$ mou.\n\nNOTE 3.\u2014A priest at Liu-an, Anhui (10) states:\n\nIci le peuple ne connait pas le nom mou, ou compte la grandeur des terres par le nombre de tan qu'on paye de tsou [rent] et on dit, \"Je cultive 5, 6, etc., tan de terre.\"\n\nNOTE 4.\u2014Rev.

Williams (17) states as regards Nanking:\n\nAfter sending to the Hien six or eight times I have finally obtained a complete table:\u2014\n102 CURRENCY AND MEASURES IN CHINA.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n10 \\text{ F\u0103n (\u5206)} &= 1 \\text{ Ts'nn (\u5bf8) or Inch} \\\\\n10 \\text{ Ts'un} &= 1 \\text{ Ch'ih (\u5c3a) or Foot} \\\\\n5 \\text{ Ch'ih} &= 1 \\text{ Pu (\u6b65) or Pace} \\\\\n2 \\text{ Pu} &= 1 \\text{ Chang (\u4e08)} \\\\\n180 \\text{ Chang} &= 1 \\text{ Li (\u91cc)} \\\\\n200 \\text{ Li} &= 1 \\text{ Tu (\u5ea6)} \\\\\n360 \\text{ Tu} &= 1 \\text{ Cheu-Tein (\u5468 \u5929)}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThe foot in this table is what is called the Kiu-cheh-ch'ih (\u4e5d\u6298\u5c3a), or Carpenter's Foot, nine-tenths of the ordinary foot. It does not measure exactly this according to my measurement as reported in the paper sent you. I ought to say, however, that I have had no access to any official standard, and have had to measure a number of those in actual use by carpenters and merchants, but as both the carpenter's rules measured by me were a little more than nine-tenths of the longest Ts'ai-ch'ih measured, I considered they could not be far wrong.\n\nAccording to this, the foot in the above table is twelve and one-half inches in length (English). This will make the Pu, or Pace, equal to 62.5 Inches (English) and the Li equal to 1,875 English Feet.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n100 \\text{ Square Ts'un (\u5bf8)} &= 1 \\text{ Square Ch'ih (\u5c3a)} \\\\\n25 \\text{ ,, Ch'ih} &= 1 \\text{ ,, Pu (\u6b65)} \\\\\n4 \\text{ ,, Pu} &= 1 \\text{ ,, Chang (\u4e08)} \\\\\n6 \\text{ ,, Chang} &= 1 \\text{ F\u0103n (\u5206)} \\\\\n10 \\text{ F\u0103n} &= 1 \\text{ Mow (\u755d)} \\\\\n100 \\text{ Mow} &= 1 \\text{ Ch'ing (\u9803)} \\\\\n540 \\text{ Mow} &= 1 \\text{ Square Li (\u91cc)}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nIt will be seen by this that 240 Square Pu make one Mow. The Ch'ih is of same length as in the table of length, i.e., 12.5 Inches (English), so that a Square Pn will equal 27.126 Square Feet (English) and a Mow 723.36 Square Yards (English).\nNote 5.\u2014Rev. P. Hoang (1) states:\n\nThe legal measure kung \u540b containing 5 \u916c\u9020 ch'ih equals 1.537 m\u00e8tres (60\u00bd English inches). This measure was a few years ago [prior to 1882] legally prescribed for the measurement of land formed thereafter by alluvial deposit; while for old land the use of the measure traditionally employed in each district is permitted. The traditional measure, judicially admitted in the district of Shanghai, equals 1.676 m\u00e8tres (66 inches). [N.B.\u2014This gives 1 acre = 6 mow exactly]. This measure was a few years ago sent by the Shanghai Taotai to the British Consul. In the country two other measures are in use, one = 1.690 m\u00e8tres, one = 1.770 m\u00e8tres.\n\nIn Tsung-ming \u5d07\u660e, where measurement is frequent on account of continual accretion by alluvial deposit, the traditional kung equals 1.720 m\u00e8tres. During the Ming dynasty a stone of this dimension was erected in front of the Magistrate's Yam\u00ean, for standard comparison. There the common instrument of measurement is a thin strip of bamboo, called Chang-po \u652f\u5e1b, measuring 10 kung = 17.2 m\u00e8tres.\n\nNote 6.\u2014Rev. J. C. Gibson (23) states respecting Swatow:\n\nThe \"pace\" is not in practical use here and its length is not known. Theoretically it should equal about 5 feet, the pace being measured not between right and left foot when stepping, but between successive positions of either foot, which is twice the distance.\n\nThe Li is often used, but its length is very indefinite. It is used here (also in the Amoy region and Formosa, and in the Hak-ka country) chiefly as a fractional part (one-tenth) of the league (\u91cc), and the length of the latter varies greatly. It represents about an hour's moderate walking on level ground. If the \"pace\" be taken at 5 feet, then 360 paces\nto the Li would give 1,800 feet as its length, which would be a fair average here.\n\nNo one seems to know the area of the Mow, and it is said to vary not only in different districts, but to be variously reckoned on fields contiguous to each other.\n\nThe Mow is divided into tenths (\u5206). Land is commonly described by its average yield reckoned in Piculs (\u62c5) of ripe grain unshelled, 5 Piculs to the Mow being a fair yield in good seasons. This is the standard for rice-fields. These give two crops annually, the winter being the heavier (5 Piculs to the Mow) and the summer lighter (4 Piculs to the Mow). For the winter crop, a peck and a half per Mow is allowed for seed, and each Mow is supposed to contain 120 plants. For the summer crop, the allowance of seed is 3 pecks per Mow. For \"dry\" ground (\u7530) the usual reckoning is in terms of the number of plants reckoned in thousands, of potatoes or sugar-cane which it can carry. [N.B.\u2014Mr. Gibson gives no length for the pace, and I base the area of the Mow on his length for the carpenter's (and land) foot.\u2014H.B.M.]\n\nNote 7.\u2014Rev. C. Bone (19) states regarding Canton:\n\nA pn \u6b65 is 2 Chinese feet, but in some cases it is 2.2 Chinese feet. [N.B.\u2014I have disregarded this statement, and in estimating the area of the mow have taken Mr. Bone's further statement that the land foot is 14 English inches.\u2014H.B.M.]\n\nNote 8.\u2014Mr. A. P. Happer, Jr. (25) states respecting M\u00eangtz\u016d:\n\nThe Mu (\u755d) is not known here. This is stated on good authority. When land is transferred, it is paced off, or delimitated by giving the boundaries. The value is calculated on the rent it will bring, or on the quantity of grain it will\nyield per year. The pace is said to be the ordinary step of a man walking at an ordinary gait. The *kung* \u5f13 lent me measured 1.525 metres.\n\n**Note 9.**\u2014Mr. J. H. Hunt (14) states:\n\nThe *mow* (irang \u9762) is the area on which taxes are paid [in Corea]. The people do not buy and sell land by this measure. The price of a field or plot of ground is regulated by the time occupied in ploughing it, or by its average yield of grain per year.\n\n**Note 10.**\u2014Mr. Mak Sze Che (26) states respecting Takow:\n\nNatives speak of the *kap* \u7532, not the *mow* \u9762 of land; the latter measurement is not known.\n\nWith regard to Shanghai weights and measures, the following letter from the Chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce to H.B.M. Consul-General, conveys all the information of which the Chamber could dispose:\n\n---\n\n**Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce,**  \n**Shanghai, 31st July 1885.**\n\nTo P. J. Hughes, Esq.,  \nH.B.M. Consul-General, Shanghai.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 28th July, asking for information as to the denominations and equivalents of the weights and measures in use at this Port, for communication to the Board of Trade, and in reply I have the pleasure to hand you the following particulars:\u2014\nThe subject is dealt with at length in Dr. S. Wells Williams' *Commercial Guide*, chapter 5, sections 3 to 6, but as only a small number of the weights and measures indicated are in use between foreigners and natives, it is perhaps unnecessary to give details of those which are confined to native use alone.\n\n**Weights.**\u2014The weights in use for general purposes are\n\n- the Tael = $1\\frac{1}{3}$ oz. Av.,\n- the Catty = $1\\frac{1}{3}$ lb., = 16 Taels,\n- the Picnl = $133\\frac{1}{3}$, = 100 Catties,\n\nthe former being used for precious metals and the two latter for the ordinary purposes of market stuff and produce.\n\nThe usual instrument for market use is the Steelyard, which will weigh up to a picul, while larger quantities are usually treated by Beam or Fairbank scales of foreign manufacture.\n\n**Measure of Length.**\u2014The measure of length is the \"Chih,\" which is equal to 14\u00b71 inches English.\n\n**Measure of Distance.**\u2014The measure of distance is the \"Li,\" which is equal to 360 paces or 1894\u00b712 feet English.\n\n**Land Measure.**\u2014Land is generally measured by the \"Man\" = 26\u00b773 square Poles English, the subdivisions being decimals:\n\n100 mau = 16\u00b77 acres.\n\nThere does not appear to be any reliable standard for either weights or measures, the initial element in both cases being a grain of millet-seed, the equivalent of the English Barleycorn, while there is also a difference in both weights and measures varying with the article to which they are applied. Thus in Shanghai the ordinary Measures of Capacity are the Koh = 6\u00b7103 litres\n\n- the Shing = 1\u00b7031 ,\n- the Tau = 10\u00b731 ,\n\nwhich are commonly used for retailing market commodities such as rice, peas and grain generally, but the smaller measures are usually made of bamboo joints, and vary in size according to what the retailer considers will give him a fair profit.\n\nThe \"Tau\" is made of wood like an inverted pyramid with the top cut off, and holds generally 6\u00bd catties.\nFor retailing oil and spirits there are measures which contain 1, 2, 4 and 8 Taels weight respectively, and indeed almost all articles are sold by weight, whether solids or liquids, and there does not appear to be any genuine standard of capacity.\n\nIt may further be noted that both weights and measures differ in different provinces, though as far as the open ports are concerned the proper equivalents were arranged by the Treaties, but even in this the French and English do not exactly agree, though they do so nearly enough for practical purposes.\n\nAs regards measures of length again the \"Chih,\" or Chinese foot, varies with the different trades, and in Shanghai we have the following:\n\n| Eng. Inches & Decimals |\n|------------------------|\n| Junk-builders' chih = 15\u00b7769 to 15\u00b769 |\n| Custom House ,, 14\u00b7098 |\n| Tailors' ,, 14\u00b705 to 13\u00b785 |\n| Board of Revenue ,, 13\u00b7181 |\n| Artisans' ,, 12\u00b7569 |\n| Carpenters' ,, 11\u00b714 |\n| Masons' ,, 11\u00b708 to 10\u00b79 |\n\nwhile they differ again at most of the open Ports.\n\nTrusting that the above information may be of service to you,\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\netc., etc.,\n\n(Signed) J. J. KESWICK,\nChairman.\nAPPENDIX.\n\n[EXTRACTS FROM \"NORTH-CHINA HERALD\" FOR 1889.]\n\nRemittances to Peking from Shantung.\n\n\"Chang Yao reports the transmission of the following sums on various accounts to Peking: the sixth instalment of the Peking subsidy, Tls. 50,000, forwarded to the Board of Revenue by the Financial Commissioner; Tls. 6,250 transmitted by the Salt Commissioner to the Board of Revenue as interest on funds lent to the province, together with Tls. 156.2.5 for difference in weight and Tls. 50 for porterage; Tls. 6,250 to the Imperial Household for interest on borrowed capital, with similar allowances for porterage and loss by exchange; Tls. 20,000 sent by the Grain Intendant as the second instalment towards defraying the outlay on frontier defence; and Tls. 20,000 from the four-tenths of the receipts of the foreign Customs' duties at Chefoo as a contribution to the Tientsin Arsenal.\"\u2014Vol. xlii., p. 146.\n\nThe Currency Question in Kirin: Excessive Issue of Paper Money.\n\n\"January 17th.\u2014The Governor of Kirin states that the currency system of the town of Kirin is carried on on a most pernicious system, and as a remedy for the great inconvenience and suffering which it entails upon the people, he suggests that a portion of the subsidy which the province receives yearly from Peking should in future be remitted in copper cash. Cash, he states, is the proper standard for the monetary requirements of the people, and paper money is only to be resorted to when it proves insufficient. If the latter could be made to circulate freely and the price of commodities, whether paid in cash or paper, could be equalised, it would prove a real convenience for the people, to which no objection could be raised, as in the other provinces where paper money is used to supplement the ordinary currency. In Kirin, however, the case is quite different. Here the notes no longer represent a cash value, and, being inconvertible, have given rise to\nabuses greater than any ever resulting from the financial expedients of the Sung dynasty. The commercial transactions of the town are all based on a gigantic system of credit, against which prohibitions have been issued from time to time without effect. The notes of the system lay in its convenience for use in the market where money was required to pass rapidly from hand to hand, and in course of time its use was extended until it assumed its present dimensions and afforded facilities to dishonest merchants for fraudulent practices and overtrading. The notes were put on the market without any regard to the capital possessed by the establishment issuing them, and people seeing that they could buy silver or goods with mere paper, naturally preferred to hide away their cash, and make gain without employing money at all. Merchants who came to the city to trade, observing the high price of silver and articles of commerce, feared that they would lose heavily on any goods purchased there, and took their cash to other places where they could invest it better. The consequence was that there is an unusual scarcity of cash in Kirin, and that prices have gone up to an enormous height. The soldiers and officials suffered more than any other part of the population. By an old regulation a part of their salary was paid out of the local revenue, and to begin with was issued at a discount of twenty per cent. The chief source of revenue is a tax upon distilleries paid in convertible paper, of which it took considerably over four tiao to make a Tael, but which was issued to the officials and soldiers at the rate of three tiao to the Tael. But this did not represent the total loss. The other cities in the province would not accept the convertible paper of Kirin, therefore the soldier was obliged, if he wished to return home, to exchange his paper money for silver at the current high market rates. When he reached home he had to convert his silver into cash, and as the price of silver was lower than in Kirin he again sustained a heavy loss. The country people who brought produce into town found themselves unable to sell it unless they took the price in paper money, and as this was utterly useless in the country they were obliged to exchange it at a ruinous loss before returning. Vendors of firewood, and other poor creatures who had carried heavy burdens from a long distance into the city, would often want a few cash to buy food to appease their hunger, and would find themselves unable to obtain it, to such a pitch had the abuses of the currency system attained. After a consultation with the local, civil and military authorities, Memorialist drew up a set of regulations for reducing the price of silver, and placing the copper and paper money on a uniform basis, and took steps to have them enforced among the mercantile community. During a specified period, when outstanding notes were presented for payment, at least 20 per cent. of the\namount was to be given in cash, and after the third moon of next year, the further issue of inconvertible paper was to be entirely discontinued. It is feared, however, that in making such a radical change, a difficulty might at first be experienced in obtaining cash to meet the requirements of trade. The late Governor proposed to open a local mint for the coinage of cash, but the difficulty of procuring copper renders this scheme unsuited to the exigencies of the case. Kirin draws from the Board of Revenue in Peking quarterly subsidies for defence purposes, and half-yearly allowances for the maintenance of a drilled force in the province. It is suggested that each of these payments, Tls. 10,000 should be issued in copper cash at an exchange of 3,000 cash to the Tael, and be forwarded in carts to Kirin along with the remittances in silver. Or if it is thought better, the Board might direct one of the provinces which coins copper cash and has communication by sea with Manchuria to forward a similar amount of cash by steamer to Newchwang, whence it could be sent overland to Kirin, where it might be used in the payment of salaries instead of a direct remittance from the Board.\u2014Referred to the consideration of the Board of Revenue.\u201d\u2014ibid., p. 175.\n\nCoinage of Cash in Shensi stopped through want of Foreign Copper.\n\n\u201cFebruary 21st.\u2014About eighteen months ago steps were taken for the erection of a mint to coin copper cash in Shensi. Ch\u00ean-nan is the only district in the province which produces copper, but the quality is so poor that for coinage purposes it can only be used in combination with the foreign metal, and supplies of the latter had to be procured from Shanghai. During the time that the mint has been working, eleven castings have been turned out, representing a total of 19,800 strings of cash. The supply of foreign copper is nearly exhausted, and the officers who were sent to Shanghai to make further purchases report that owing to the stoppage of the Japanese copper works and other causes the price of the article has so gone up as to place it out of their power to procure any more. Under these circumstances, and in view of the fact that the experiment of using the native copper alone has not proved a success, the Governor asks permission to be allowed to postpone further coinage operations until foreign copper can be procured at reasonable rates.\u201d\u2014ibid., p. 311.\nCurrency and Public Works in China.\n\n\"Our readers will have noticed that some of the correspondents whose reports on the condition of the distressed districts we have published, have at times referred to the losses incurred in the exchange of silver for copper cash. Those who distributed relief after the Yellow River inundations, some two years ago, had similar experiences, and we suppose it would be the same anywhere in the empire where foreign commerce has not increased the working capital of bankers and merchants. The rise in the price of cash caused by the sale of the few thousand taels of sycee that have been sent to Shantung and Manchuria this year, may have partly arisen from the exactions of the money-changers, but we are inclined to think that it has been chiefly brought about by what we may call natural causes. Money-changers are seldom possessed of more than a few thousand taels of capital and very often they have only a few hundred. The influx into a district of a quantity of sycee which would have no effect on the money market of even a second or third rate open port, would very soon exhaust the resources of all the cash bankers in the inland districts. We are aware that in some places the native bankers have behaved very liberally in their dealings with the missionaries who have been distributing the relief funds, but where capital is very limited and business almost at a standstill, from the condition of the country, it could not be expected that the most generous conduct of bankers would have much effect on the market price of copper cash. But the probability is that the bankers were able to do very little to prevent losses in exchange from lack of means. Even if they bought sycee at prices considerably under those ruling in the other provinces, they have not the means of transporting it which would enable them to realise a profit, and it is evident that the supply of cash and the amount of sycee used in the districts we are referring to, are both limited. The writer of Chinese Characteristics very graphically described the other day the state of the currency, if we can apply this term to the wretched cash of the country, and the troubles which await all those who have to use it. We were all more or less acquainted with these evils, which we take to be about the most serious which injure China. The condition of the cash in use in all the provinces becomes almost periodically so bad that the Peking Gazette is stuffed with Memorials and Edicts on the subject, from which but little good results. The truth is, as we have said before, that there are too many people, of all ranks and degrees, throughout the empire, some of whom are enriched by, and others live upon, the badness of cash and the inequalities of sycee, for any great improvement in either to be attempted by the Govern-\nment. No doubt, some of the higher officials would be glad to see the evils abolished and even a coinage introduced, but reform in this direction, like other western improvements, must come slowly. It is a matter of regret that the mint which the Viceroy of Canton procured from England for the coinage of cash is not to be worked, but if His Excellency's change of plan is owing to the advance in the price of copper which took place last year and in 1887, we hope that the recent decline in the value of the metal may induce him to change his mind again.\n\n\"We suggested some time ago that the Viceroys and high officials in the afflicted provinces should employ the people in road-making, the repair of waterways and other public works. If these have been undertaken to any great extent they will be of great service to the country, but we confess that we are not sanguine of anything of consequence being done in these things. Yet nothing would, under the circumstances, be of greater service to the country and the people, for the latter would be provided with some means of subsistence while commerce and the movement of troops would be facilitated. Such improvements could not be objected to by the most conservative Chinese, for they would be in accordance with old ways and the patriotic spirit which is supposed to animate the policy of the Government. No doubt the rulers of China know perfectly well that they must meet the criticism of the outside world, which their predecessors neglected and despised. When, therefore, the country suffers, as unfortunately it has suffered, great distress in recent years, and foreigners are appealed to for aid, the Government should know that the amount of subscriptions from other countries will be greatly affected by the manner in which the officials have discharged their duties or are discharging them. We noticed not long ago that the Spectator questioned the wisdom of English people subscribing to the Lord Mayor's fund, and we have no doubt that its remarks on the subject have caused at least some people to withhold their money. Not only Heaven but men help those who help themselves; and if foreigners see that the Government of China does not take effectual steps to mitigate the evils from inundation or drought, much less practical sympathy will be shewn by them on the next recurrence of such disasters. And as a proof of the critical attitude of Englishmen to this country, to which we have referred, and which the Government must meet, we mention the fact that the news of the outbreak at Chinkiang had an immediate and considerable effect in diminishing the subscriptions to the Relief Fund. We commend to those who have the ear of the great officials, if any such foreigner there be, the advocacy of useful public works and currency reform.\"\u2014ibid., p. 399.\n\"The subject of Chinese currency demands not a brief paragraph, but a comprehensive essay, or rather a volume. Its chaotic eccentricities would drive any Occidental nation to madness in a single generation, or more probably such gigantic evils would speedily work their own cure. In speaking of the disregard of accuracy we have mentioned a few of the more prominent annoyances. A hundred cash are not a hundred, and a thousand cash are not a thousand, but some other and totally uncertain number, to be ascertained only by experience. In wide regions of the empire, one cash counts for two, that is, it does so in numbers above twenty, so that when one hears that he is to be paid five hundred cash he understands that he will receive two hundred and fifty pieces, less the local abatement, which perpetually shifts in different places. There is a constant intermixture of small or spurious cash, leading to inevitable disputes between dealers in any commodity. At irregular intervals, the local magistrates become impressed with the evil of this debasement of the currency, and issue stern proclamations against it. This gives the swarm of underlings in the magistrate's yamen an opportunity to levy squeezes on all the cash shops in the district, and to make the transaction of all business more or less difficult. Prices at once rise, to meet the temporary necessity for pure cash. As soon as the paying ore in this vein is exhausted, and it is not worked to any extent, the bad cash return, but prices do not fall. Thus the irrepressible law by which the worse currency drives out the better, is never for an instant suspended. The condition of the cash becomes worse and worse, until, as in some parts of the province of Honan, everyone goes to market with two entirely distinct sets of cash, one of which is the ordinary mixture of good with bad, and the other is composed exclusively of counterfeit pieces. Certain articles are paid for with the spurious cash only. But in regard to other commodities this is matter of special bargain, and accordingly there is for these articles a double market price. That enormous losses must result from such a state of things, is to any westerner obvious at a glance, although the Chinese are so accustomed to inconveniences of this sort, that they seem almost unconscious of their existence, and the evils are felt only as the pressure of the atmosphere is felt. Chinese cash is emphatically 'filthy lucre.' It cannot be handled without contamination. The strings, of five hundred or a thousand (nominal) pieces, are exceedingly liable to break, which involves great trouble in re-counting and re-tying. There is no uniformity of weight in the current copper cash, but all is both bulky and heavy. Cash to the value of a Mexican dollar weigh not less than eight pounds avoirdupois. A few hundred cash are all that anyone can carry about in the little bags which are suspended for\nthis purpose from the girdle. If it is desired to use a larger sum than a few strings, the transportation becomes a serious matter. The losses on transactions in ingots of sycee are always great, and the person who uses them is inevitably cheated both in buying and in selling. If he employs the bills of cash-shops, the difficulty is not greatly relieved, since those of one region are either wholly uncertain in another region not far away, or will be taken only at a heavy discount, while the person who at last takes them to be redeemed, has in prospect a certain battle with the harpies of the shop by which the bills were issued, as to the quality of the cash which is to be paid for them. Under these grave disabilities the wonder is that the Chinese are able to do any business at all; and yet, as we daily perceive, they are so accustomed to these annoyances, that their burden appears scarcely felt, and the only serious complaint on this score comes from foreigners.\"\u2014ibid., p. 411.\n\n---\n\nResistance to Change of Currency in Kirin.\n\n26th June.\u2014\"A memorial from the high authorities of Kirin states that it has long been the practice in the provincial capital to make use of irredeemable bank notes instead of money. The custom having proved to be injurious to the Government, the army and the people alike, the memorialists obtained permission from the Emperor to put a stop to it altogether. On the promulgation of a notice to this effect unbounded joy was manifested by the public. At the same time six months' warning was given to those concerned, and arrangements were made for carrying out the change gradually. The utmost consideration was thus shown to the merchants, who, notwithstanding, in their greed and covetousness swore an oath not to obey. As a first step they bribed certain unworthy gentlemen, who drew up for them a general petition full of bad arguments and concealed threats; but the memorialists refused to be influenced by this. Finally one house, the Jui-shang Bank, has now suddenly closed its doors for no cause. Unavoidable bankruptcy is a common enough occurrence and would call for no special remark. But in the present instance the pretended insolvents had only four days previously received twelve thousand taels on account of one Government department and ten thousand taels on account of another. Their action can therefore only be regarded as a deliberate swindle conceived with the object of putting pressure on the authorities. The enormity of the offence is moreover aggravated by the fact that they have long been the busiest of traders and have made immense profits at the expense\nof other people. The memorialists have ordered the prefect to imprison both the proprietors of the bank and their assistants, and to take measures to recover the moneys owed by them. Even if they discharge all their liabilities in full, they must still be punished severely, in order that others may be warned by their example. It is further requested that one of the officers from whom they received the Government money may also be made a defendant in the case, in order that it may be discovered by a rigorous investigation whether he acted in collusion with them or not.\u2014Approved.\"\u2014Vol. xliii., p. 50.\n\n---\n\n**Paper and Silver Currency.**\n\n\"The use of seals had extended much in China about two centuries after Christ, and this led gradually to stamping silk and skin for various purposes. Just at that time the manufacture of paper was introduced from the West and it was found to be an article capable of many common uses. This led the Taoists, for example, to multiply charms rapidly by stamping them on paper to sell to the superstitious, either to hang on their doors or to carry with them when travelling. Commercial accounts were written on paper for convenience, and merchants and shopkeepers provided themselves with seals for stamping. They came into the habit also of stamping the paper before or after they wrote their figures upon it. This was the state of things when the establishment of the Caliphate on the Euphrates gave an impetus to Eastern trade. The Chinese in the eighth and ninth centuries made much more silk than before for foreign countries. The spread of the silk manufacture in Western regions did not put an end to the demand for the silk goods of China or for the unwoven silk. Neither Europe nor Western Asia could manufacture enough of their own silk to meet the demands of the market. The historian Robertson says of this period that the silk of China was purchased in Shensi, the westernmost province of that empire, and conveyed thence by caravan in a march of eighty or a hundred days to the banks of the Oxus, where it was embarked and carried down the stream of that river to the Caspian. After a dangerous voyage across that sea and ascending the river Cyrus as far as it is navigable, it was conducted by a short land carriage of five days to the river Phasis, which falls into the Black Sea. Thence it was taken by ship to Constantinople. While such was the activity of trade by land there would naturally be a corresponding expansion\nof seaborne traffic from the seaports of China to India and farther west. The three centuries of the Tang dynasty at the same time gave opportunity to home commerce to grow in proportion. Trade flourishes when an empire is at peace. It was these circumstances combined which led to the invention of paper money in the Tang dynasty, and it was to the Chinese merchants and statesmen, particularly of the ninth century, that the credit is due in the first instance of employing paper money in the form of drafts payable at certain cities.\n\n\"Those who wish to master this subject will find much to interest them in Vissering's work, which received the Julien prize a few years ago. During the present year the Peking Oriental Society has published a paper (taken chiefly from a work by Wang-lin, published in 1831) by the lamented Japanese Minister to China, Shioda Sahuro, on the same subject. This paper is of very great value. It brings out clearly the point that silver was not employed as money before the Tang dynasty, and that it was then introduced. Reference is here made to the work called Ji Chilu by Kn Yen-wu,* who died two centuries ago, where it is said that before the Tang dynasty copper cash was the medium of exchange between Government and people, and silver had never come into use. At that time silver was already introduced in South China, meaning by that term Canton and Kwangsi. It is a curious fact that at about A.D. 500, according to Chinese history as examined by Kn Yen-wu, there were in regard to money circulation three belts of country. In the extreme south, gold and silver were in use, Canton being the centre of trade. In middle China, all along the Yangtze into Szechuan, copper cash were used everywhere as the medium of exchange. All this belt of territory, with Canton, Kwangsi and Tongking, was then ruled from Nanking as the centre. In the North, which was under Tartar administration, copper cash and grain were employed as a double medium of exchange. The effect of Tartar control was to favour barter and keep back the onward advance of monetary conveniences. Even now soldiers are paid in grain when they are upon the old r\u00e9gime, but the new drilled troops are paid in silver. It is noticeable here that silver began to be a currency in South China first and at a time when China sent her prefects regularly to rule in Cochin-Chinese and Cambodian cities. Gold in ancient China was much used on account of its great abundance. But silver began to enter China because it is produced abundantly in Burma and because it was a circulating medium in India and farther west. The silver which circulated by weight in Canton in A.D. 500 would be partly\n\n* See Wang Ziu's work \u9214\u5e63\u82bb\u8a00 Ch'au-pi-chu-yen.\nBurmese and partly what Arabian merchants and others brought from distant ports. The Arabian trade would certainly have a share in the introduction of silver by weight into the commerce of China in its southern provinces. We find many proofs of the activity of the Arab merchants from the Han dynasty downwards. This is probably another instance of it. The Mei-ling mountains, on the north of Canton province, at that time separated the belt of country which traded by weight from the belt of country which traded with the help only of copper coins, and this was noticed by the celebrated author Han W\u00ean-kung in a memorial he sent to the Emperor about A.D. 800. Ynen Chen, another great statesman, mentioned about the same time that salt and pieces of silk were used as money in Szechuan. Cinnabar and quicksilver, he added, were used as money in Kiangsi, as also pieces of cloth and silk. At that time any valuable article which had a known price in the market could be bartered like coins elsewhere. It was in this way that silver came into extensive use. It was of a fixed value according to weight, and the silver mines of Burma made it very convenient when the influence of the Chinese Government extended to that region. Another step in the use of silver was taken when in A.D. 1035 it was commanded that the provinces of the empire should not in future be expected to pay taxes in the same form. Most portions of the empire would pay in copper cash. Fukien, Canton, and Kiangsi might send silver, Kiangsu and Chekiang could contribute silk. This is the first instance of the payment of taxes in silver being recognised in an edict, and it was 854 years ago. Since that time the influence of silver has been increasing to the present day, for during this century the change of grain to silver in the contributions of the people to the expense of the Government has in many localities been made for the first time. A change back again from silver to grain or from silver to copper is never known.\n\n\"For eight centuries the use of silver by weighing it, as a circulating medium, has been increasing in China, and it has known no check but the introduction of the dollar. The dollar, however, has only perhaps represented in the amount of its circulation a contemporaneous growth of new trade. The sycee in use as money has certainly not diminished in quantity on account of the large import of Mexican dollars which China now requires, for these dollars, when cheap, are often melted down into sycee. A thousand years ago the people in Central China kept their accounts in copper cash, which at that time would in the market procure a much larger amount of clothing and provisions than now, and the inconvenience of copper, on account of its relative weight, would not be so much felt. They did not then change cash into silver.\"\nin totalling up their daily and annual entries, because the change from copper to silver as a standard of value had not yet been made. Arabian trade brought to China the use of silver by weight as European trade at a later period brought the dollar. In both cases the flow of silver has been traceable from south to north in successive zones of country. The convenience of a paper currency made itself felt much sooner in China than in any other country because of the early use of engraved seals, the immense internal trade, and the commercial instinct of the people.\"\u2014ibid., p. 139.\n\nWant of Control over the Circulating Medium.\n\n\"About sixty years ago a student of Chinese history in Soochow made some deep researches into the question of the currency. The currency was then becoming more and more out of the reach of Government control. Foreign trade was increasing. The Government had for nearly two centuries left silver to work its own way as money paid by weight, and received it in payment of taxes from each arrondissement. Only the copper cash were issued by the Government. For silver there was no mint and never had been but once, and that for a short time, yet this metal had grown to be one of the most important elements in domestic as well as foreign trade. It was the same with paper. Paper notes representing money were issued by private capitalists in all large cities, and the Government had no interest in them. Their success as a circulating representative of silver was entirely at the risk of the native bank. Silver and paper both represented money in all the large transactions of trade. The small market negotiations in copper cash which belong to the daily life of the people, and which, while as transactions they are counted by millions, are always small in bulk, were the only trading operations of which the Government issued the circulating medium. How strikingly different was this state of things from that which exists in the West, where gold, silver, copper, nickel, and stamped paper are all issued by the Governments as money. Our author knew nothing of this, of course, but he was still able to cast his eye over a wide range of financial facts. China had had a long history of financial experiments and a succession of prosperous and disappointing experiences. With the national annals before him, each dynasty having its special chapter on finance, it never struck him that China was, or could be, deficient in financial knowledge or unable to meet the new conditions of the time. He attempted to show that a change in policy was required in finance, and the\nconclusion he arrived at, and which he tried to prove by argument, was that a Government paper currency ought to be again issued and the use of silver prohibited. The people should attend to agriculture rather than to trade. This was their proper occupation, and would lead them to a spirit of contentment. The circulating medium of trade ought to be in the hands of the prince as a source of revenue.\n\n\"The reasons, he said, why the monarch cannot easily control the currency or derive revenue from it are fivefold. Coppersmiths melt coin because they wish to use the copper in making wash-basins, tea-kettles, and images of the gods. This is the first interference with the monarch's authority. In addition to this, lead and spelter are employed to make spurious coin in the furnaces of law-breakers aiming at a little profit. This is the second interference; and the third is the extending use of foreign dollars. (It is worthy of remark that through the whole of his book the author, writing in 1831, makes no allusion to opium; yet it is unquestionable that the spread of Spanish dollars first and American dollars afterwards was very much connected with the opium trade. At the same time he makes no allusion to the silk or the tea trade. His point is simply that it is a loss to the Chinese Government not to have the profit arising from the control of the currency. As to commercial questions he seems to have no information, nor did he seek any.) His fourth reason why the Government fails to derive benefit from the circulating medium is that the market price of silver is entirely in the hands of the merchants. He would like the Government to regulate the currency by authority\u2014not knowing that it is disastrous and vain for official authority to attempt to modify prices. China has learned many lessons since the day when this author lived. The fifth cause of the feebleness of the Government in regard to the control of the money market is the fact that bank notes and bills of exchange are issued by private capitalists.\n\n\"Our author's advice to the Government was to make a law prohibiting the use of silver in money payments and at the same time restore the issue of Government bank notes which had been so long discontinued. In his opinion this was the only policy by which the five evils from which the Government suffered could be eradicated and the country made prosperous. In support of this view he appeals to the history of money in China. Ancient statesmen saw the propriety of drawing a revenue of cereal products from one locality, of textile fabrics from another, and of coined money from a third. They did not see the need of a large issue of coins, except occasionally, when floods and drought compelled the adoption of this expedient. Nor did finance minis-\nters in very early times limit money to silver or to copper. Pearls and jade, tortoise-shell and cowries, bundles of silk and grass-cloth, served as money in China's ancient markets. About B.C. 800 an old poem says: \"A simple-looking lad, you were carrying cloth to exchange it for silk.\" The official master of the market, says the comment, stamped the cloth for use in barter, and it was two inches in width and 16 inches long. The author adduces this as classical authority for an issue of Government bank notes. But as the poem mentions merely barter, and the explanatory remark is that of an author of A.D. 200, how can we know whether the market officer stamped the cloth or not? It may have been a simple case of barter. Whatever is meant it would scarcely be by stamping, for this mode of giving official validity was hardly in use so early. Why, for example, do we find that the cash of the Ch'in dynasty, B.C. 220, were issued without any inscription upon them? Books tell us that the Han dynasty monarchs were the first to direct characters to be inscribed upon their coins. This practice commenced about B.C. 200 and was never afterwards neglected. He refers to another example\u2014that of painted squares of white deer skin, which in the reign of Han Wu-ti were used as money. They were priced at four hundred thousand cash each, and were presented to the Emperor by the high nobility or by his relatives at the daily audiences or at high festivals, after which they could pass into circulation for the amount mentioned. At that time there was also a silver coinage, the silver being mixed with tin as an alloy, on account of the whiteness of that metal. This alloy of tin was doubtless intended to prevent all attempts at melting the imperial coins. The melter could only lose by the act, and if it was not worth his while he would not place the coins in his melting-pot. This seems to be a clear historical instance of silver coinage lasting for a very short time. Neither the silver coins of Han Wu-ti nor the painted squares of white deer skin remained long in use; and the high value assigned to the deer skin would suggest that it was something like the million pound bank note of Samuel Rogers, which he displayed in the chimney-piece of his breakfast parlour. It was more an object of admiration than of utility, in an age of luxury and gaudy show. As to the origin of paper currency in China, we must look to an age later than the Han dynasty.\"\u2014ibid., p. 171.\n\nTen Reasons for a Paper Currency.\n\n\"In the Ming dynasty, about A.D. 1600, when the Board of Revenue was desirous to return to the use of paper money, the\nGovernor of one of the provinces stated in a memorial what appeared to him to be the ten advantages of paper money. The first was that it could be manufactured at the capital of each province for use in that province. The second was that it could circulate widely. The third was that it could be carried with ease, being light. The fourth was that it could be readily kept in concealment. The fifth was that it was not liable to division like silver into different grades of purity. The sixth was that it did not need weighing, as was the case with silver, whenever it was used in a commercial transaction. The seventh advantage was that silversmiths could not clip it for their own nefarious profit. The eighth was that it was not exposed to the peering gaze of the thief's rapacity. The ninth was that if paper took the place of copper, and copper ceased to be used for making cash, there would be a saving in the cost of this metal to the Government, or the copper saved could be used in manufacturing arms for the troops. The tenth advantage would be that if paper were used instead of silver, the silver might be stored up by the Government.\n\n\"Our author in citing these ten reasons for adopting a paper currency adds that the last two are defective. In adopting paper for the mercantile classes the copper coins would remain in use to meet the necessities of the common people. So also silver should continue to be used in making ornamental articles and head-gear of various kinds. It would be a mistake to shut it up in the Government treasury and prevent its being accessible to silversmiths. There is a fallacy lying hidden in our author's reasoning. He thought that the authority of the Government was all that was essential to the successful establishment of a circulating medium, not reflecting that if paper were so employed there was need of a corresponding store of gold or silver in readiness to pay value for the notes if the people lost confidence in them and wished for their metallic equivalent. It did not strike him that the financial credit of the Government bank can be sustained only by payment in gold or silver to discontented holders of paper. He thought only of supplying the demand for ornaments and not of a run on the treasury. In fact, China is too large a country and the merchants as a body too powerful by their numbers for the Government to attempt successfully the prohibition of silver, nor can it refuse to allow the issue of paper money by private banks. The difficulty in establishing a national bank is found in the fact that the Government cannot take better care of the interests of the mercantile classes than each private capitalist can do for himself, and in the difference which exists in the commercial conditions of the various provinces.\n\n\"In the ten reasons for adopting a paper currency, when it is suggested that each treasurer of a province should issue bank notes,\"\nit may well be asked, why not leave native banks in possession of this privilege, which is not only a benefit to themselves but to trade generally? It is certainly a great advantage to travellers that through the wide business connections of the Chinese bankers, bills of exchange may be bought in Shanghai and cashed in any of the provincial capitals of the empire. Both to native and foreigner this is an unquestioned benefit, and renders travelling ten-fold easier than if the silver had to carried in the traveller's trunks. In the fifth and sixth reasons alleged for Government paper currency the Chinese writer touches upon two patent and unanswerable objections to the present system. The silver is weighed at each transaction, and it is circulated in varying states of purity. The scales at which silver is weighed differ in each locality and the traveller feels himself outwitted. His money becomes less at each new point in his journey, and a general feeling of dissatisfaction with the currency grows upon him on his return; however, he would naturally become more reconciled to the tyranny of the scales had he silver left to weigh, for when he arrived again at places of large trade, his sycee weighs as much in proportion to bulk as before. The scale differs to allow the money-changers in towns of small trade to pay their expenses, and when this is understood the indignation of the traveller sinks somewhat. But there is a worse trouble than the variation in scales. It is the variations in the purity of the silver. It becomes alloyed in many ways and is reduced to purity only by re-melting. Blacksmiths melt the silver, and in all places of large trade there are assaying offices which certify the purity of silver for a small sum. Silver sent to Peking to represent taxes has cut into it by the treasurer of the province, the name of the arrondissement from which it comes, and of the blacksmith who melted it. Only silver of first purity is allowed to be sent to Peking. In this way the Government indirectly aids in rendering the silver which is in circulation as money much more pure than it would otherwise be, but the introduction of new silver into the money market is the work of merchants alone. Also the law does in a direct way by statute undertake to protect silver from the incessant efforts of the unprincipled who for private profit in every possible way try to diminish its purity. But it is so hard to discover the evil-doer that statutes are promulgated in vain and the owner of the metal is in fact only protected by the shroff and the assaying office. When it is considered how much impure silver is in circulation there does seem strong reasons for a silver coinage. This would at once improve the standard and raise the average of purity. To reject the precious metals as currency because their purity is tampered with, in favour of paper, would be a mistake. The cure for the evil is to maintain the efficiency of\nthe statutes which aim at the punishment of crimes against the currency. Mexican dollars are now much more uniform in value than sycee silver, and the convenience of a coin is so great that it is remarkable that the Chinese Government does not follow Japanese example and establish a mint.\"\u2014ibid., p. 208.\n\nThe Origin of Paper Currency in Seals.\n\n\"The introduction of paper currency in China is very closely connected with the ancient history of printing. Those native authors who have referred to early passages which speak of the employment of seals by officers to give a money value to certain articles as the real commencement of paper currency have done quite right. Grass cloth, silk, and paper all admit of an impression being made on them with ink or with vermilion. In fact, vermilion mixed with oil was perhaps the oldest printer's ink, and the impression of the seal made of jade, copper, silver, gold or wood was, if we allow the word block to include stone and metal, the oldest block printing. The Chinese saw seals from Western Asia and they made them themselves with their own writing cut upon them, to be used in giving validity to official documents, as also to employ them as amulets to protect them from imaginary evils. The seal was not only used to stamp charms, but the handle was a tortoise, a tiger, or some other emblem of longevity or power, in order that it might have a defensive effect against evil. These ideas imported from Western Asia with the seals were as willingly adopted by the Chinese for imitation as the more reasonable idea of employing the seal as a manifest proof of the genuineness of documents. Among the more important of the improvements introduced and additions made to the Chow legislation by the founder of the Ch'in dynasty was the extensive use of seals. The progressive spirit of that dynasty is unquestionable. This is shown by the fact that many features of the Ch'in legislation were adopted by the Han Emperors. Among them was that of giving a seal to every officer. The silver seals now called Kuan-fang of officers of the 1st and 2nd rank, and the copper seals of Taotais are the continuation of an old rule which has come down from B.C. 221. The system has been found most useful because the seal was the sign of delegated authority, and of the fact that the viceroy instead of being himself a monarch was the representative of the imperial head of the state. The seal was the visible sign of the change from feudalism to centralisation. From that time it gradually became a\nfixed idea with the Chinese that they must have a seal impressed on every writing as a proof of property or genuineness. All scholars and firms at the present time have a seal, and seals are placed on books, drawings, and letters, to an extent which is quite remarkable. Since this custom can be traced back to the Han dynasty it becomes easy to understand that the way was open whenever any one chose to extend a seal, by cutting it in relief instead of internally, into any one kind of blank form and into the printing of books. The multiplication of copies by stamping followed readily from the use of a stamp to give validity, and a stamp of four or eight or ten characters might readily be expanded into twenty or fifty. So then we have in the early use of seals the ideas of official validity, of superstitions efficacy and of the possible multiplication of copies, beside the use of the seal, as given to every official appointed by the Emperor.\n\n\"Some one may ask what have superstitions observances to do with the origin of printing and of paper currency? To this the reply may be given that superstition makes a custom popular and often helps a good notion to spread rapidly. The Taoists were accustomed to cut seals of the wood of the jujube tree four inches square, or three-and-a-half of our inches, and circulated them among the people to check evil influences. They taught the people to believe that there were evil influences in the air always ready to affect them mischievously, and then they provided them with guardian charms to secure them from the harm which they themselves had taught them to fear. They are not alone in thus acting, for in other countries it has happened that superstition has been ingeniously made a source of pecuniary profit by not a few. The occasions when the use of seals as proof of genuineness were required were of course very numerous. It is mentioned for instance that generals had their orders cut on seals for rapid circulation among the troops under their command. In such a case in the third and fourth centuries the writing in camp orders would be white while the ground was black or red. All the seal cutting and the circulation of charms and of mirrors with lucky sentences and animal shapes engraved on them were in every case so much preparation for the success of paper currency when the time should come. Not only does the credit rich men possess contribute to that success, but also the invention of blank forms rapidly multiplied by printing. The blank form saves time in writing and it also makes the document more uniform, more easily tested and more readily accepted as valid when presented to a third person. The dynasty of Ch'in Shi-huang gave the use of seals to China and from that time forward the possession of an official seal became essential to each office. The Han dynasty simply followed the Ch'in dynasty rule. When this came to be the\ncase the seal impressed with vermilion was attached by regulation to every document issuing from each officer, metropolitan or rural.\n\n\"If then the Chinese in the Han dynasty had the common use of seals large and small, and if paper was introduced about A.D. 200 as we know, how long a time might he expected to elapse before the use of paper money, and the era of the printing of books? In fact, seven centuries passed before hooks were commonly printed, and eight centuries before paper currency was adopted systematically by the Government. The Chinese, intelligent as they certainly are, and lovers of every practical improvement as they plainly are, were not at all in a hurry to print books to save the expense of copying, or to issue Government paper money to save the expense of copper or silver. What the Chinese highly appreciate when adopted they are usually very slow to adopt. This is true of gunpowder, which they only began to use about the twelfth century, although they had fireworks in the sixth century. A small cause often retards the adoption of remarkable inventions. In this case it seems to have been the habit among workmen of cutting into the material of the seal instead of cutting the inscription in relief. When once the thought occurred to some one that relief cutting would leave a white ground with a red or black inscription, the path would be open for the invention of blank forms first, and for the printing of books afterwards. What Chinese authors tell us is that seals in the Han dynasty and later left the characters white when impressions were taken from them, and further that in the Tang dynasty the characters in the impressions from seals became red. The meaning of this statement appears to be that the old seals were all or almost all cut in intaglio and that about the beginning of the Tang dynasty cameo cutting or cutting in relief became common. This casual remark of a Chinese author throws light on the fact that paper currency began in the Tang dynasty and at the same time the period of printing books was brought so much nearer because the artisans of that age began to engrave in relief. There was in fact Government paper money about A.D. 806 and there were printed books about A.D. 920.\"\u2014ibid., p. 265.\n\nThe History of Paper Currency.\n\n\"The first attempt at paper currency in China of which any record remains was in A.D. 806, when bills of exchange were called 'flying money.' Merchants in the capital could by an ordinance then first made receive Government bills in return for the merchants' copper money. On arrival at any provincial capital\nthey could receive from the provincial treasurer the amount stated on the bill. There was a return to this system, which was a sort of banking facility offered to the merchants by the Government, about the year A.D. 960. A bureau was instituted in Kai-feng-fu, then the capital, for the transaction of this business.\n\n\"In 1023 Szechuen was suffering from the iron cash coinage which the Government from scarcity of copper was forcing on the people there. The paper notes then put in circulation at Cheng-tu by the Government were meant as a relief. They were to be returned once in three years. The idea sprang up among the rich merchants and was accepted by the Government, and the merchants conducted the business. The limit of capital represented by the notes was 1,255,300 strings, a string being a thousand copper cash. In A.D. 1150 the Golden Tartars had just conquered North-China, and about this time they adopted a currency in paper because they found copper scarce. Copper, silver and gold have always been chiefly found in South China. A North-China kingdom finds it convenient to use paper so far as possible, to prevent its being dependent on a southern neighbor. From this time forward, during a century of the Golden Tartars and another century of the Mongol domination, strenuous efforts were made to maintain a paper currency. Colonel Yule, Dr. Bushell and others have printed fac-similes of the notes of these periods. They are found, for example, in Yule's Marco Polo and in the Journal of the Peking Oriental Society published this year. All the efforts of the Government did not secure the credit of the notes at par. On the contrary, they became depreciated to an extreme degree. This, however, did not prevent the Government of the Ming dynasty, which acquired the sovereignty in A.D. 1368, from continuing for a time paper currency which was finally abandoned as silver flowed into the country through the foreign trade which brought to the southern ports a portion of the products of Mexican and Peruvian mines. It was American silver that gave the death-blow to paper currency in China. The arrival of sufficient silver was the real relief which Chinese trade required. Notes were finally abolished about A.D. 1620. Thus the conquest made by silver over paper occupied about a century or a little more, from the commencement of the trade of the Spaniards and Portuguese with Canton.\"\u2014ibid., p. 292.\n\n---\n\nGold in 1889.\n\n\"Gold has kept its price well in China during recent years. The constant demand from Europe to meet the needs\nof the countries that have lately established a gold coinage has had its effect on the gold market in China. Germany began to absorb eighty million pounds sterling fourteen years ago. It was done in the following manner. There were in 1875 in circulation 640 million marks of small notes, equal in English currency to 32 millions sterling. They were replaced by notes of 100 marks or above 100 marks in value, that is, \u00a35 notes and \u00a310 notes, and by gold and small coins. Between the middle of 1875 and the end of that year notes had been exchanged for coin to the extent of \u00a315,000,000. Paper gave place to coin in Europe just as in the Ming dynasty in China silver increased in quantity and the Government found that it would be better not to issue any more paper notes. The new love for gold in Europe has influenced the most distant money markets. Consequently Peking, Chefoo and Corea are now every year sending gold to Shanghai for transmission to Europe. They are sending all they can and as fast as they can get it ready. Take for instance the export of gold from Tientsin. The following figures appear in the Customs' Reports, and it must be remembered that it is Peking gold chiefly that is here entered:\n\n**EXPORT OF GOLD FROM TIENSIN.**\n\n| Year | Tls. |\n|------|------|\n| 1882 | 574,414 |\n| 1883 | 610,022 |\n| 1884 | 112,238 |\n| 1885 | 1,781,337 |\n| 1886 | 1,875,976 |\n| 1887 | 1,706,864 |\n| 1888 | 1,398,264 |\n| 1889 (six months) | 1,044,459 |\n\n\"The rich families in Peking are parting with their hoards of gold because of the good price at Shanghai. Silver is cheap and all the rich property-holders of China count their treasures in taels of silver. They are attracted by the gain which they can acquire by an increase in the number of taels of silver which is paid them at Shanghai for hoarded gold, since the price of silver went down. This table shows how steady on the whole the outflow now is year after year. It went on increasing till 1886. Then it declined a little. Now it is rising again. In Chinese life it is quite common for rich families to become poor. In such cases gold ornaments will be exchanged for silver. The thick needles round which women's hair is bound, their bracelets, rings, and other\nornaments, if of gold, will, when poverty comes in at the door, be exchanged for silver. Gold thus sacrificed may go far to pay a husband's debts. Men who are not poor will give their gold to make profit by exchange. In Peking there are likely to be many rich men who have acquired wealth in the provinces and who have for convenience carried it to Peking in the form of gold. From their hoards much of the present stream is probably supplied. They see a sufficient reason when they read in the Chinese newspapers that they can obtain perhaps Tls. 23.6 of silver for one tael of gold in the Shanghai market.\n\n\"The gold sent from Chefoo to Shanghai is gradually increasing in quantity as may be seen in the following table:\n\n| Year       | Value in Hai-kuan Taels |\n|------------|-------------------------|\n| 1881      | 58,348                  |\n| 1882      | 68,448                  |\n| 1883      | 48,893                  |\n| 1884      | 47,457                  |\n| 1885      | 69,520                  |\n| 1886      | 164,648                 |\n| 1887      | 140,970                 |\n| 1888      | 233,000                 |\n| 1889 (six months) | 66,260               |\n| **Total** | **897,544**             |\n\n\"The export rose until 1882. Then it declined during two years. In 1885 it rose again during three years. Now it is falling. The highest amount it has reached has been about the value of \u00a360,000 sterling a year. Books say little about Shantung gold. In the Book of History, lead is the only metal found there, in the section known as the 'Tribute of Yu.' In those days, four thousand years ago, gold, silver and copper came from Southern China as tribute to the emperors, the last two coming from Southern China alone. The great source for receiving gold was, however, the tribes who inhabited Tartary. War with these tribes in the first and second centuries before Christ brought to China immense amounts of gold. History mentions gifts made to victorious soldiers at one time of more than 200,000 catties. Of course it was a very small catty which was in use then. This was after a battle in which 19,000 of the Hiung-nu were killed. The gold\nwould be taken from the captured tents and the armour of the slain warriors. All the gold then used as ornaments by Tartar men and women would naturally be brought from Siberia or the mountainous parts of Tartary.\n\n\"The gold of Corea partly is forwarded to China, but most of it goes to Japan. In both cases it is probably sooner or later sent to Europe to meet the present demand:\n\n**EXPORT OF GOLD FROM COREA.**\n\n| Year       | To China | Value in Dollars |\n|------------|----------|-----------------|\n| 1885       |          | 46,100          |\n| 1886       |          | 218,743         |\n| 1887       |          | 210,294         |\n| 1888       |          | 348,564         |\n| 1889 (six months) |      | 115,014         |\n|            |          | **938,715**     |\n\n| Year       | To Japan | Value in Dollars |\n|------------|----------|-----------------|\n| 1885       |          | 388,269         |\n| 1886       |          | 911,745         |\n| 1887       |          | 1,177,975       |\n| 1888       |          | 1,025,401       |\n| 1889 (six months) |      | 339,448         |\n|            |          | **3,836,838**   |\n\n\"There seems to be no probability of a rapid increase in the yield of Chefoo gold or that of Corea. The native apathy in regard to the existence of gold in various parts of Shantung promontory is noticed by Dr. Williamson in his *Journeys in North-China*. Yet there is a sufficient yield of the most precious of metals to warrant the expectation that after a time Shantung may produce gold in greater abundance. The legal prohibition to search for gold has led to the surface only being scratched. To dig beneath the surface is to deprive the land of its prosperity. This belief has influenced both the people and the Government. The consequence is that more is left for the men of coming ages. In Australia the abundance of gold does not diminish as the works become deeper, and it is expected that they may be continued for a depth of two thousand feet, and gold still be found. If this view is correct, China must have a good prospect of obtaining large...\"\nquantities of gold in future years, not only in Shantung but in many parts of the southern provinces and on the southern slopes of the Altai mountains in particular. The present drain of gold from Shanghai does not alarm the Chinese much, but it must later produce an effect on them. The following table shows the present condition of the export:\n\n**EXPORT OF GOLD FROM SHANGHAI.**\n\n| Year       | Value in Haikuan Taels |\n|------------|------------------------|\n| 1886       | 1,746,248              |\n| 1887       | 3,449,853              |\n| 1888       | 2,018,899              |\n| 1889 (six months) | 862,875               |\n\n\"The maximum was as appears from these figures about eight hundred and thirty thousand pounds sterling in 1887. The amount of export is now declining. This is not because the demand in the west is less, but more probably because there is a limit to the quantity of gold which the holders are willing to convert into silver at the current price.\"\u2014ibid., p. 437.\n\n---\n\n**Customs Duties at Newchwang.**\n\n23rd September.\u2014\"The Viceroy Li submits a return of the duties received by the Foreign Customs at Newchwang during the quarter ending 30th September 1888.

The balance remaining over from the present and previous quarters is Tls. 74,511.7.0.6.9.3.6.\"\u2014ibid., p. 445.\n\n---\n\n**Silver in China.**\n\n\"The silver used in China as a circulating medium in her commerce has been increasing, in quantity especially, for four hundred years, and most rapidly of all during the present\n\n*Note the six places of decimals in the totals.*\ncentury. Each industrious Chinaman represents so much wealth by his labour, that is, so much silver, for silver has now for several centuries been the standard of money value in this country. The increase of population means an increase of wealth wherever there is scope for industry; and in localities where opportunity is wanting, it leads to emigration. At the beginning of the Ming dynasty, in the latter half of the fourteenth century, the public currency had fallen into a most unsatisfactory state through the Government not being able to maintain the credit of the paper notes then used. Yunnan was conquered, and it contained many silver mines, and these were worked to increase the quantity of silver then rapidly coming into use as a medium of exchange. We are told that in 1578 the Government received from Yunnan 13,764 taels in paper money, 944 piculs of grain and 5,769 strings of shells. Two hundred years later the amount received in hemp, cloth and silver amounted to 14,801 taels of this last metal. The strings of shells used as money had disappeared. The cumbersome grain tribute in heavy bags had become changed for silver. But hemp and cloth were still received by the Government tax-collector because they could be exchanged for silver, and the expense of conveyance of these articles was not very great. Yet after a few more decades this mode of paying taxes will again be exchanged for silver, which in a country like China has proved to be the most economical form of tribute. The Government in these circumstances began to prize silver very highly. It keeps its value as an article in great request for ornamental work. It is cheaper to convey than other kinds of tribute. It is acceptable in trade, and the merchant is far more willing to part with his goods for silver than for paper money. Hence the Government made efforts to obtain more of it. They set criminals to work in the mines of Yunnan. This was in 1460; and they do not seem to have allowed Chinese employers of labour to manage mining operations. They considered it good policy to keep the mines in their own hands, and they ordered the high officers to report fully on any failure in the working or diminution in the yield of metal. Then in 1463 the works were suddenly ordered to be stopped, probably because of earthquakes, for a few years later, in 1511, the Governor of Yunnan sent up a memorial advising that all the mines should be stopped, on account of fresh earthquakes; but they were opened again in 1514, notwithstanding other objections which were pressed at the time, such as the gathering of a rough-spirited population at the mines, and the neglect of agriculture in the province leading to want of food to supply the needs of immigrants. At this very time American silver began to enter the country through foreign trade at Canton and Amoy. More silver was thus introduced and a real need\nsupplied, for it enabled Government to abandon both the shell currency in the south-west and the paper currency everywhere; and the merchants were very glad to see the last of the Governments, (sic) and to have in their place this shining metal. Silver was now wanted by every one, to keep in store or use in buying as he pleased.\n\n\"The value of silver in copper cash has gone through great vicissitudes. It has been three thousand and it has been one thousand per tael. In A.D. 1696 a tael of silver was worth 1,750 cash, and it is now, A.D. 1889, worth 1,380 in the Shanghai market. In the reign of Yung Cheng, about A.D. 1730, thirty-six taels of silver were paid for a month's maintenance to twenty-one workmen at cash foundries in Y\u00fcnnan. That is to say, one ounce and three-fourths of silver would then support an able-bodied workman for a month. In 1555 the casting of cash in Y\u00fcnnan was commenced, on account of copper being produced there in abundance. The disuse of paper made a new supply, both of silver and of copper cash, a necessity, and from that time forward both metals have been needed; and when the growth of population is remembered they must still continue to be required in increasing quantity. Two centuries ago the workman could live for 100 cash a day. Now more is required, because prices have risen and every one who carries on his shoulder his baskets of market-produce from his little farm to the adjoining local centre of merchandise, expects more money for it than his grandfather did. The old currency needs to be modified to meet the new conditions. Copper cash are not enough for the uses of common life. Silver is required to do what the cash, through gradual sinking in value, cannot do. Two hundred cash are wanted to buy that amount of food and clothing for which in former times one hundred would have been enough. That is to say, the man who goes to market to buy must carry with him twice as much weight in copper as his great-grandfather did. It is more convenient in these circumstances to have small silver coins, and this is our convenience in the west, or small notes issued by native banks and properly stamped and inscribed may be used, as they still are in Peking.\n\n\"Yet small silver coins could not now in China take the place of copper cash. Copper must continue to rank in China as the most widely useful of all currencies, because of the disproportion in the expense of living in large cities and in country districts, and the wide differences in climate existing between the north and the south and between mountain and plain in so large a country as China. That coin is most adapted to China which has the most minute divisibility. A dollar which is now worth 3/8d. is divisible into a thousand separate coins composed of a mixture of copper and\nIt suits the prices of marketable articles and the incomes of the people to retain this sub-division in current coins. Even silver is circulated in very small lumps as well as in large ones, and the small hand steelyard used in weighing it is sub-divided into hundredths of an ounce. Such a steelyard is part of the kit of every traveller, as a check on the weighing of the money-shops.\"\u2014ibid., p. 534.\n\nCopper Cash.\n\n\"The older books written by Chinese archaeologists on the history of cash contain at the beginning examples of money professing to come down from the primitive ages. Some of them belong to Fnhi and others to Shennang. The foreign collector of cash ought to know if he has such coins in his cabinet that this immense antiquity is given to them by medieval mythmakers. The best modern numismatists do not recognise such a claim. Yet they appear in a book of so much authority as Hsi Ch'ing Ku Chien, compiled by an imperial commission and published A.D. 1749. Seven hundred years ago, when the capital was at Hangchow, the first complete book on Chinese coins was published. Since that time archaeologists have been numerous and a persistent effort has been made to collect newly-found coins. Builders of houses and walls, countrymen at work in the fields, restorers of bridges, and diggers of canals in any part of China, from time to time meet with old cash which are added to the current coins in circulation or are sold or presented to local numismatists. There never has been a law against the use of old cash mixed with the new, nor has there been any official effort made to collect them, and in consequence it is an everyday occurrence to meet with coins made a thousand years ago. The traveller in China does not know, unless he examines carefully, how many relics of distant centuries constantly pass through his hands or through those of his 'faithful Achates.'\n\n\"The chief interest attaches to coins of a time anterior to the bookburning\u2014B.C. 211. That was the period when literature and the arts and sciences took a mighty spring upward. It was the time when great books were written, destined to be ever after preserved by a grateful nation as those precious heirlooms which a mad conqueror in his enmity against the sages failed to destroy. The coins of that time are indicators of progress in commerce and the arts in various localities of Northern China. We may consider it as proved that bronze casting and the manufacture of iron implements as well as goldsmith's and silversmith's work were\nwell advanced long before Confucius. The history known as Kwo yu shows that this was the case in regard to work in bronze. But cash were cast before B.C. 524, for it is recorded in that year that larger coins than had been before made were then cast in Honan on the banks of the Yellow River by order of the Chow emperor. From the collections of the numismatists it appears that a square hole in the middle and a legend of two characters were in use as early as this in Chinese coins. Hwo was the word for 'money,' meaning that which is changed (hua) for something else. Pao, 'valuable,' was prefixed to it. But coins must have existed before this, and in the Han dynasty it was fully believed that Kiang Tai-kung, the chief minister of Wen Wang in the 12th century before our era, introduced them in Shensi when in office and afterwards in Shantung when he retired to his principality. His special repute is for advancing commerce, and it was under his fostering care that the salt trade of Northern Shantung came to exercise a decided influence on the development of internal commerce in ancient China. The history of Pankoo ascribes to Kiang Tai-kung the origin of round coins as distinguished from knives and pieces of cloth. We may adopt this view and may connect it with improvements in metallurgy and new acquisitions of foreign knowledge at the beginning of the Chon dynasty. If Kiang Tai-kung is rightly credited with the origination of round cash, the period of that improvement is then fixed to the 12th century before our era. Yet it may be that he is credited with it because he promoted trade and was possessed of political sagacity shewn in other useful measures. If at any time between the eleventh and fifth centuries before our era the coins called cash were introduced by any statesman in Northern Shantung, whose name did not shine out with lustre in history, it was very likely that the improvement would be attributed to Kiang Tai-kung. It would be by a suggestion from the strings of sea-shells then used as money that the idea of a hole for stringing the new copper coins would be most probably derived. Further it would be before the time of Kwan Chung, the great administrative statesman of the seventh century, for in the book purporting to be written by Kwan Chung, there are several references to the coining of cash, but the compiler does not attribute the invention to Kwan Chung himself. Perhaps in these circumstances it may be best to assign the first round metal coinage to about the ninth century, the age of Sinen Wang, when the country was prosperous and wars were conducted successfully. But this may be too late, and there is really no very strong reason based in the old literature of China why to Kiang Tai-kung the honour of introducing a copper currency should not be assigned. The remarkable old work Chouli, in describing the\nadministration through all its departments mentions among them a cash office for the manufacture and issue of cash. But this book was probably small at first, and its bulk increased from one period to another, and this particular statement may have been inserted, we know not when, by some unknown official. We must wait for more discoveries from underground. The railway from Peking to Hankow will in Chihli and Honan proceed through a country occupied by a people who for four thousand years at least have ploughed and sown the land, carried the produce to market, exchanged it for something necessary for use or ornament, and returned to their homes with their new possessions. The railway works may anywhere in that region, 'rich with the spoils of time,' yield interesting treasures which will throw light on the past. Should there be a line made from the city of Confucius, or from Taishan to the north of it, to Tientsin, it would bisect the very territory which belonged as a feudal fief to the traditional founder of the copper currency of China. As about many other ancient matters, so on the question of the origin of this currency, our successors will know with certainty what now cannot be determined.\u2014ibid., p. 745.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n\nTHE PRESERVATION OF THE NESTORIAN TABLET AND OTHER ANCIENT MONUMENTS AT SI-AN-FU.\n\nThe following correspondence on this subject has passed between the President of the China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society and the doyen of the Diplomatic Body at Peking:\n\nCHINA BRANCH OF THE ROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY,\nSHANGHAI, 24th February 1890.\n\nSIR,\n\nIn accordance with a resolution lately passed at a meeting of the Council of the China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, I have the honour to bring to Your Excellency's notice the condition of the interesting monument at Si-an-fu known as the Nestorian Tablet.

Prehistoric means \"before history.\" Not that we should suppose China had ever been without a history. Life, and especially human life, means history. Wherever there is life there are changes of various kinds, and there is development of some kind. We have, therefore, to take the word \"history\" in a narrower sense, as \"Writing on History.\" Prehistoric China, then, means China as it existed before reliable historical records were written about its state and the events of life within its boundaries.\n\nChinese history begins with the Annals of the feudal state of Lu, 722 B.C., published by Confucius 240 years later. Though even this work has suffered somewhat by the doctrinal tenets of Confucius, still we find in it a statement of facts and a natural order of events. There are also other records of that period preserved by which many statements of the Confucian text can be verified and others rectified. Of the time before the eighth century B.C. we find no such trustworthy historical records in China. Although there are still a number of documents in existence supposed to belong to earlier periods, we have no unquestionable evidence of their authenticity, but strong arguments to the contrary. The safest position that can be taken under such circumstances is to regard all documents of such earlier literature of China as productions of the time of Confucius and succeeding ages. Many of those works, are, we admit, based on earlier traditions and, it may be, even on earlier written memoranda, but facts\nand legends, truth and imagination, original statements and later enlargements are deplorably mixed together. We need a trustworthy guide to lead us through such labyrinths. The same is true of other traditions and folk-lore preserved by later writers. There are also ancient monuments and other relics of antiquity found in China, all of which should be examined and compared, but we have no access to them. No Chinese museum is at our disposal where we could find antiquities of all ages, well arranged for comparative study. Thus it seems almost hopeless to arrive at anything reliable in regard to the earliest history of Chinese life.\n\nThere is, however, fortunately enough, still a rich mine of solid historical metal unworked at our feet\u2014I mean the Chinese written characters. Much has been written on Chinese Writing, but the written characters have not yet been used as guides into the remotest antiquity of China. This is the purpose of the present paper. Every written character, taken in its isolated value, without reference to the composition and meaning of sentences, is a historical monument. But some characters are of an earlier, some of a later, date. By applying a truly scientific method we are enabled to follow the stream of Chinese writing upward to its source, from the myriads of written characters of the present day to its one hundred elementary characters of about 4,000 years ago. These 100 elementary characters, each of which is a sketch of an object out of the scenery of Chinese life 4,000 years ago, will reveal to us Prehistoric China in an astonishing comprehensiveness of detail.\n\nIn opening thus a new path of research it can, of course, not be expected that every step should be smooth at once as on well-trodden ground. But the path is leading to a summit, and the view from there over many important questions relating to Chinese antiquity will more than repay\nthe outlay of time and labour. The results will be decisive in some respects. May qualified scholars improve on the imperfections of this rough-hewn attempt.\n\nFor an easier understanding of the paper with all its detailed arguments, a short statement of its method and a brief summary of its results will be welcomed by the student. The attribute of \"truly scientific\" is claimed for the method. Facts and evidence are alone the materials it works with. The facts are the myriads of Chinese written characters of the present day. Most of these characters are composite forms. By analysis we reduce them to their component parts of simple characters, i.e., into forms still recognizable as characters and not further reducible. Thus we arrive at about 100 Elementary Characters. I say about 100, without giving a definite number, because the ancient forms of some characters are undecipherable. A few examples may suffice for illustration: \u8774 from the classifier \u866b and the primitive \u79d1 a compound of \u79be and \u6597. Thus we find the three elementary characters \u866b, \u79be and \u6597 as component parts of the character \u8774. The meaning of each component part is, beginning at the left side, \"worm,\" \"grain,\" \"peck.\" As, however, the two latter characters form a primitive, and as such only indicate the pronunciation, which is in this case k'o, we arrive at the meaning\u2014a worm called k'o, or a tadpole.\n\n\u85fb is composed of \u534a and \u4fdd = \u4ebb or \u516b, \u53e3 and \u6728, altogether of four elementary characters.\n\n\u85fb of \u6728 and \u85fb = \u5e7f, \u65e5, \u6708, \u72ac, five elementary characters.\n\n\u6b4c of \u6b20 and \u85fb = \u5341, \u53e3, \u4f73, four elementary characters, the last being the figure of a bird in ancient writing.\n\n\u85fb of \u706b and \u85fb = \u5e7f, \u6728, \u7c73, (the latter probably derived from \u6728); thus we get either three or four elementary characters.\nof \u76ee and \u516b = \u4e59, L, \u516b, four elementary characters.\n\nof \u884c (which is a composite classifier) and \u96e8 = \u76ee, \u4f73,\nthree elementary characters.\n\nof \u5973 and \u865a = \u53e3, \u53e3, \u6708, \u51e1, five elementary\ncharacters.\n\nof \u5927 and \u5f13, two elementary characters.\n\nExamples of characters not decipherable are \u4e5f and \u5e1d.\n\nAnalysis of the modern Chinese written characters leads\nto the following facts:\n\n(1.)\u2014The whole multitude of Chinese characters can\nbe divided into two natural groups\u2014phonetic and\nnon-phonetic;\n\n(2.)\u2014All phonetic characters are composed of a classifier\nand one other character, simple or compound,\ncalled primitive;\n\n(3.)\u2014The non-phonetic characters are also either simple\nor compound;\n\n(4.)\u2014All characters are reducible to about 100 simple\ncharacters;\n\n(5.)\u2014Most of these simple, or elementary, characters are\ncontained in the list of 214 classifiers;\n\n(6.)\u2014Every elementary character is a rude outline of an\nobject;\n\n(7.)\u2014The form of the elementary character contains no\nindication of its pronunciation;\n\n(8.)\u2014We meet with elementary characters modified by\nturning or by simple additions which are not\ncharacters;\n\n(9.)\u2014We find two or more elementary characters\ncombined into a new character without indication\nof pronunciation;\n\n(10.)\u2014We find simple, or more frequently compound,\ncharacters used to indicate pronunciation;\nThe facts formulated in these ten paragraphs are beyond dispute. From them we draw two conclusions with mathematical exactness:\n\n1. \u2014 Elementary characters must have been in existence before compound ones;\n\n2. \u2014 Compound characters existed before they were used to indicate sound, (i.e., as primitives).\n\nBy these two conclusions three periods of writing are established in logical order:\n\n1. \u2014 Elementary characters, or Period of Pictorial Writing;\n\n2. \u2014 Their modifications and combinations, or Period of Ideographic Writing;\n\n3. \u2014 Their use to indicate pronunciation, or Period of Phonetic Writing.\nThe facts are taken from Pan Ku's *History of the Han Dynasty* (\u524d\u6f22\u66f8) and from the writings of Tuan Y\u00fc-ts'ai (\u6bb5\u7389\u88c1), a famous writer under the present dynasty (*see* \u7687\u6e05\u7d93\u89e3, Books 567-666). The *Imperial Encyclopaedia*, (\u53e4\u4eca\u5716\u66f8) has been compared, but to no advantage. Other works will be mentioned in the course of the essay.\n\nThe earliest attempt at making records was by knotted cords. (Notice the striking similarity in the English word record). The invention of these quipos is attributed to Sui Jen (\u71e7\u4eba), by other traditions to Shen Nung (\u795e\u8fb2). Both of them are legendary Beings. The early use of quipos is, however, a fact, as they can still be seen among the Tu-fan and Si-fan in Tibet and among the Miao Tsz in Kweichow Province. \"When making a contract they bind cords on pieces of wood, the number of knots showing the number in the agreement.\"\u2014(Wuttke, *Geschichte der Schrift*, p. 243.)\n\nFuh Hi ordered Flying-dragon (\u98db\u9f8d\u6c0f) to draw the eight trigrams. In the *I-king* (*see* Dr. Legge's translation, App. III, Chap. ii, 11) it is said:\u2014\"Anciently, when Pao-hi (= Fuh Hi) had come to the rule of all under heaven, looking up he contemplated the brilliant forms exhibited in the sky, and looking down he surveyed the patterns shown on the earth. He contemplated the ornamental appearances of birds and beasts and the [different] suitabilities of the soil. Near at hand, in his own person, he found things for consideration, and the same at a distance, in things in general,\"\nOn this he devised the eight trigrams, to show fully the attributes of the spirit-like and intelligent [operations working secretly], and to classify the qualities of the myriads of things.\"\n\nThis passage exhibits fine imagery and beautiful style, but goes far beyond any possible meaning of the eight trigrams. If it could be applied to the elementary characters of Chinese writing, which will be treated in the following pages, we should praise this passage as an excellent description of them. As it stands, it is nothing more nor less than an example of first-rate composition from the school of Confucius.\n\nHwang Ti (2700 B.C.) ordered Ts'ang Hieh (\u5009\u9821) to observe the course of stars and note down the traces of dragons and birds. Thus were formed the tadpole characters (\u874c\u86aa). It is also stated that another minister of the same emperor, the court-recorder Ts\u00fc Sung (\u6cae\u8a54), (Mayers, Chinese Reader's Manual, 747), assisted Ts'ang Hieh. Certain it is, that the two together are worshipped as the \"Gods of Writing\" (\u5b57\u795e). That Ts'ang is commonly mentioned alone is explained as \"brevity of style\" (\u6587\u7565\u4e5f). As Ts'ang is described as having had four eyes, we have to take all tradition about him as myth.\n\nFrom Hwang Ti we have to pass over at least 1,500 years without finding another notice on writing. After the establishment of the Chow dynasty, (commentators say during the reign of king Ching, 1115-1079 B.C., but the first commentator lived 1,200 years later) some officers, called Pao Shi (\u4fdd\u6c0f), used the Six Scripts (\u516d\u66f8) to teach their royal pupils. (See Chow Li \u5730\u5b98, xiii, 27, of the small Imperial edition). This statement may be true, though we regard the Chow Li as a later compilation (about 200 B.C.) of everything known about official duties, to their latest development during the Chow dynasty. The idea that Duke Chow should have written all those details at the very commencement of\nthe dynasty is too absurd for refutation. The great prominence given to categories, or short formulas, into which all theoretical as well as technical knowledge is reduced, points to repeated teaching by masters of the art. A few such categories may have become formulated in remoter antiquity, but the Chow Li shows such a remarkable perfection in this line, that it can only have been the result of those great schools of Taoism and Confucianism which flourished from the sixth century B.C. to the close of the Chow period.\n\nThe text of the Chow Li says nothing of the contents of the Six Scripts. In the commentaries we find Cheng K'ang-sheng's (A.D 127-200) description:\u2014first, figures; second, ideas; third, inversions; fourth, relations; fifth, of metaphorical meaning; sixth, phonetic characters. This appears to be a record of ancient tradition. The historian Pan Ku gives the six forms in another order, as: first, \u8c61\u5f62; second, \u8c61\u4e8b; third, \u8c61\u610f; fourth, \u8c61\u8072; fifth, \u8f49\u6ce8; and sixth, \u501f\u5047. Though Pan Ku lived earlier than Cheng K'ang-cheng, his statement must be of a later origin. We can easily discover the reason why the order was altered,\u2014merely to put together all the \u8c61, pictures of forms, pictures of affairs, pictures of ideas, pictures of sounds; these four categories exhausted whatever the author considered expressible by pictures. It is a theoretical arrangement, and even as such not quite adequate, as the fifth group contains figures of the first simply turned around, pictures of changes. We see, however, from these different statements that the forms of the written characters were an object of study in China a few centuries before the beginning of the Christian era. Taking everything into consideration, we have to place the Six Scripts after the invention of the Great Seal characters. The Pao-shis of the Chow dynasty were probably the first teachers of Chinese writing. They brought the whole number of characters, for their own and their pupils' convenience sake, into six groups.\nThis was the first attempt at a systematical arrangement of all known characters, and an improvement on Chow's work on the Great Seal characters. These six groups were well adapted to the characters then in existence, as the greater part were elementary or ideographic, only a few being phonetic. But these phonetic characters multiplied so much during the classical period, about 550\u2013300 B.C., that in the revival of letters during the Han time the old system of six groups, which had already fallen into disuse, was found impracticable, and a new method had to be adopted. No work on the Six Scripts was published till some centuries after the Shuoh Wen. This Shuoh Wen brought the new method of arrangement by Classifiers to light, which gave it the most decisive success. It is an artificial system compared with the natural system of the Six Scripts. But the Six Scripts were practicable only for a small number of characters. The very existence of its arrangement is a proof that the number of characters was limited to some hundreds in one class, most probably not much exceeding one thousand as sum total.\n\nIn Pan Ku's Catalogue of the Han Library, twelve works dealing with the subject of Written Characters (\u5c0f\u5b78) are mentioned, the first of which is that by the historiographer Chow (\u592a\u53f2\u64ad). He lived under the Emperor Suen, 827\u2013782 B.C., and was the inventor of the Great Seal characters (\u5927\u7bc6). He wrote fifteen slips called \"Chow's Book;\" six of them were lost in the Kien Wu time, A.D. 25\u201355, and, consequently, nine were then still in existence. The total number of Chow's Great Seal characters may have been about one thousand. The proof of this calculation will be seen below. During the time of the Contending States, when China was divided into seven quasi-independent kingdoms, every one of them had its own agricultural method, its own width of carriage-wheels, its own criminal law, its own fashion of dress, its own language and its own writing.\nAfter the Emperor of Ts'in, Shi Hwang, had united the states into one absolute monarchy, his prime minister Li Sze (\u674e\u65af), (Mayers, 368), treated with scorn any writing which did not agree with the letters (\u6587) of Ts'in. He published a book on the subject (227 B.C.) Two other scholars, Chao Kao (\u8d99\u9ad8) and Hu-wu King (\u80e1\u6bcb\u656c) also wrote independently. A village teacher (officer), \u95bb\u91cc\u66f8\u5e2b, of the Han dynasty (probably between 200-150 B.C.) united these three works into one, with the title \u8ad6\u8a9e\u4e00\u7de8. He put sixty characters into one chapter and obtained 55 chapters, which gives a total of 3,300 different characters. These are the Small Seal characters (\u5c0f\u7bc6), and are meant whenever Chuen shu are quoted by the Shuoh Wen. The Great Seal characters were from that time commonly quoted as \"Old Style\" (\u53e4\u6587).\n\nThe scholar Ch'eng Miao (\u7a0b\u9088), (Mayers, 110), during ten years' imprisonment, improved on the Great Seal characters in another way, and produced the form called \u96b8 or \u96b8\u66f8 (Li shu), (200 B.C.) Y\u00fc-ts'ai does not mention Ch'eng, but says that this form of characters was invented by officers of prisons who had much writing to do. It became official business style. Yang Hung (\u694a\u96c4), (Mayers, 883), republished the village-teacher's work (A.D. 1), and added 34 chapters, i.e., 2,040 new characters. His work, entitled Huen-tawan (\u8a13\u7e82), contained altogether 5,340 different characters in 89 chapters. Not one character was repeated (\u4e00\u7121\u91cd\u8907\u4e5f).\n\nKia Fang (\u8cc8\u9201) added to Yang Hung's work 34 chapters, including 13 chapters written by Pan Ku (\u73ed\u56fa). Thus his work contained in all 7,380 different characters, in 123 chapters. None of the above-mentioned works have been preserved. H\u00fc Shen (\u8a31\u614e), however, digested all works that existed in his time, and finished his great Shuoh Wen (\u8aaa\u6587) in the year 100 A.D. It contains 9,353\ndifferent characters and 138,441 characters for explanation. To the original number of different characters the author afterwards added \u91cd, 1,163, including 396 ancient forms, 145 forms from Chow and 622 doubtful forms (see \u8aaa\u6587\u89e3\u5b57). As the work had suffered more or less in the course of time, Ta Ts\u00fc (\u5927\u5f90), (A.D. 986) revised it. All modern editions follow Ts\u00fc's text. It contains 9,431 original characters, i.e., 78 more than H\u00fc's, and 1,279 additional characters, i.e., 116 more than H\u00fc's. The explanatory characters, however, are 10,742 less than H\u00fc's.\n\nH\u00fc in his work explains first the sense (\u7fa9) of each character; secondly, its form (\u5f62); and, lastly, its pronunciation (\u97f3). The Shuoh Wen has remained a standard work among the Chinese. As it contains not only a repository of the ancient form of so many characters, but also a summary of the current meanings attached to them about 2,000 years ago, its value among Chinese scholars is even on the increase, especially among the Han school of Confucianists.\n\nThe Confucianists are, and have been during 600 years, divided into two contending parties\u2014the Sung school, with Chu-fu-tsz as head, which is the dominant party, with Imperial sanction for the State examinations, and the Han school, which attempts a grammatico-historical understanding of the Classics. The controversy is still going on, not without heat and bitterness. Several new editions of the Shuoh Wen have appeared during the last few years, and a number of critical essays on its contents have been published separately. The introduction of Classifiers was of the greatest benefit to Chinese students. Though H\u00fc Shen is not mentioned as their inventor, his Shuoh Wen is the first work known of that makes use of them. After the invention of paper and of the hair-pencil (about 300 A.D.) the elegant forms of writing, \u6977\u66f8 and \u884c\u66f8, came into use, and after the invention of cutting blocks and printing from them (about 10th century A.D.), the present form used in printing, called Sung pan (\u5b8b\u677f), first made its appearance,\nSeveral kinds of fanciful characters were already known to Pan Ku. In the Han Catalogue he mentions a work (\u516b\u9ad4\u516d\u6280). The commentary explains the 8 ti as (1) Great Seal, (2) Small Seal, (3) Puzzle (\u523b\u7b26), (4) Animal style (\u87f2\u66f8), (5) for Stamps (\u5e55\u66f8), (6) Court style (\u7f72\u66f8), (7) Spear style (\u6bb3\u66f8), (8) Business style (\u96b8\u66f8). Nothing is said of the six chi. The numbers 3, 4, 5 and 7 were fancy-styles, and should serve as a warning against the supposition that inscriptions showing characters of uncommon forms should be considered as very ancient. Many varieties of the Seal characters are brought together in a recent Shanghai publication (\u5b6b\u9cf3\u5c45\u5148\u751f\u767e\u9ad4\u7bc6\u66f8\u5343\u5b57\u6587).\n\nThe number of written characters had already increased to nearly 25,000 during the Sung dynasty. A further increase is known from K'ang Hi's Dictionary, which contains about 45,000. A list of dates and numbers will be interesting, and cannot but corroborate my conclusions respecting Chinese writing in the beginning of the Chow dynasty:\n\n| Authority       | Period | Number of different characters |\n|-----------------|--------|--------------------------------|\n|                 | B.C.   |                                 |\n|                 | 2000?  | 100?                            |\n|                 |        | Beginning of elementary characters. |\n|                 | \"      | 1200   | 500?                            |\n|                 |        | Beginning of ideographic characters. |\n| Chow            | \"      | 800    | 1,000?                          |\n|                 |        | Beginning of phonetic characters. |\n| Village Scholar | \"      | 200    | 3,300                           |\n|                 |        | (Increase of 2,800 characters in 600 years). |\n| Shwoh Wen       | A.D.   | 100    | 9,353                           |\n|                 |        | (Increase of 6,053 characters in 300 years).

But from the publication of the Shwoh Wen back to the historiographer Chow there are nine centuries, and these include the classical period of Chinese literature, and its revival during the Han dynasty, times of the highest mental activity and productivity. A period of 900 years is certainly quite sufficient to account for the formation of about 8,000 different characters. [Compare the chapter \"The Formation of Chinese Phonetic Characters, a Never-Finished Process,\" given a few pages farther on].\n\nConclusions from the Historical Statements.\n\nIn looking over this short sketch of the History of Chinese Writing, we notice at once that every item belonging to the time before the beginning of the Chow dynasty is mythical. Attempts may have been made to record important events in one way or another, as by quipos, trigrams, figures, etc. This was, however, not writing in the sense of expressing and fixing thought, but served merely to assist the memory by some incontrovertible marks. As soon as definite reasoning had to be expressed in writing, figures were found insufficient, and speech itself, i.e., the expression of thought in sounds, had to be represented. Sound is to man the medium between his mind and external form. The origin of writing, in the proper sense of the word, is, consequently, the introduction of the phonetic element into some ancient forms of figure-representations.\nIn combining the evidently reliable statements of ancient Chinese authorities on the invention of the Great Seal characters, about 800 B.C., on the Six Scripts, no matter whether we place them before or after the Great Seal characters, though the latter is more probable, and on the small number of written characters at the revival of classical learning during the Han dynasty, 300 years after the revision of the Classics by Confucius, we come to the inevitable conclusion, that the beginning of Phonetic Writing in China must fall within the period of the Chow dynasty, i.e., some time after the year 1200 B.C. It is possible that Chow, the inventor of the Great Seal characters, is the inventor of phonetic writing in Chinese, but it is also possible that he merely brought into general acceptance, through his new form of written characters, what had been of spontaneous growth before his time. There can be little doubt, that it was Chow who commenced Writing, in its proper sense, in China. Chow's fifteen slips are probably the First Book written in Chinese. But this does not exclude the existence of memoranda of various kinds. Even Confucius' edition of the Annals of Lu resembles old memoranda. This is a conclusion of very serious import. All monuments of literature, including some very famous portions of the Sacred Books of China, said to be older than the Chow dynasty, are thus pronounced to be later productions. It would have been impossible to compose those documents with characters consisting of figures of objects and ideographic combinations. As all the literary remnants of Chinese antiquity show a predominance of phonetic characters, none can be older than the Chow dynasty; they are, most likely, later than Chow's, (8th century B.C.) A few documents may, however, contain some more ancient matter in a revised form.\nThere may have been other dynasties before the Chow, such as the Hia and Shang, but their government can have been neither extensive nor powerful. Meagre lists of the names of their kings are perhaps the only genuine records of their times. Any detailed stories such as of Yao, Shun, and Ching Thang, are legends which grew into shape a few centuries before Confucius. Not even the Book of Odes contains an allusion to Yao and Shun.\n\nWriting cannot have amounted to much even in the first centuries of the Chow dynasty, till Chow invented the Great Seal characters, about 800 B.C. Of what shape the characters were before that time I have tried in vain to find out from all available Chinese sources. What the Chinese maintain to be the most ancient inscriptions show Seal characters, some of them rather fanciful, others more or less modified, but nevertheless seal characters of very uncertain date, it may be a few centuries B.C. or even many centuries A.D. Some other evidence is required to determine their age. Very remarkable is the fact, that the reliable history of China has its beginning with the invention of the Great Seal characters. As the reliability of ancient history is everywhere dependent on the way of its transmission, we are certainly justified in combining these two events. Chinese history became accurate, because Chow's invention enabled the historiographers to give their records a higher finish and to mention also many interesting details which it was before impossible to describe for want of a sufficient number of written characters.\n\nThe number of written Chinese characters cannot even then have been more than about 1,000, for the first compilation of written characters at the beginning of the Han dynasty, about 600 years later, contained only 3,300 different characters as the sum of three different works based on Chow's. Chow had, however, started the phonetic principle and had\nby it shown the proper method for further development. Thus the different schools of Taoism [compare \"The Historical Characteristics of Taoism,\" in China Review, Vol. xiii.] and Confucius with his school had no difficulties in shaping new characters to suit their literary wants. The five ancient Classics, even in their present form, contain not more than 3,235 different characters under 160 classifiers. We have, however, to remember, that the Classics were revised by Confucius and underwent other changes after their destruction in the fire of Ts'in, before they received their present shape. Ancient quotations in the writings of the philosophers of the Chow period differ considerably, and the readings of those in the Shoo Wen are perplexing. All the nine Classics, i.e., the Four Books added to the five above-mentioned older Classics, contain now 4,601 different characters. These facts will convince the most scrupulous scholar, that our estimate of the number of Chow's Great Seal characters, published 300 years before Confucius' revision of the Classics, must be very near the truth. There was in existence only about one fourth of the Classics at the time, and this in a simpler form.\n\nThe Formation of Chinese Phonetic Characters a Never-Finished Process.\n\nWhen phonetic writing was adopted in China, the old figures were not given up, but they became inevitably somewhat modified and adapted to the new method. Though in each character two elements\u2014the classifier and the phonetic\u2014had soon to be distinguished, yet Chinese scholars never showed so much scientific sense as to bring any of the two kinds into a systematic form, and thus achieve the greatest results by the simplest\nmeans. They never made any attempt to reduce the phonetics to an alphabet, in spite of their acquaintance with the alphabetic writings of India. Not even was the pronunciation of words fixed and attached to a definite set of characters,\u2014about 500 would have sufficed,\u2014and simple figures would have best answered the purpose of writing. But the Shuoh Wen contains already 883 phonetic elements, or primitives, and Kang Hi's Dictionary 4,081, many of them being very complicated characters. The classifiers are as bad, if not worse, in their scientific value. Even the 214 of Kang Hi's might with advantage be reduced to 150 or 100, and some of them better chosen. They should have their place invariably on the left side, or above, according to the nature of the character, and not anywhere according to fancy. We see, that after the Chinese had gained the phonetic principle, they allowed it to grow wild, just as chance might shape it. One who is able to understand the simple and beautiful idea underlying the Chinese mode of writing cannot but feel astonished that the Chinese never should have been able fully to grasp it. Attempts have, however, been made in the Six Scripts. Since the first mention of such a digest in the Chow Li (see p. 147), between 1100 and 200 B.C., several editions of varying merit followed up to about 2,000 years later. Such dates are instructive in other respects. The best known publication on the Six Scripts is the Luh Shu Kwo (\u516d\u66f8\u6545), 13th century A.D. Its author, Tai Tsung (\u6234\u4f97) deserves great credit for his valuable researches. He came near to our idea of Elementary Characters in his 188 Parent Forms, 45 doubtful and 245 Derivatives (included in our ideographic characters), in all 479 graphic bases. [Comp. The Six Scripts, by L. C. Hopkins]. Very handy for finding all known ancient forms of any Chinese character is the work \u516d\u66f8\u5206\u985e, in 12 vols., published during the Kang Hi period. It is arranged according to the common 214 classifiers. \"Six Scripts,\" as already shown, means\nsix classes of written characters. Two different arrangements have already been mentioned. In Mayers' Reader's Manual, p. 326, a third may be found, taken from the \u8ad6\u66f8\u8a18\u2014a work published in 1707. A fourth, though of an earlier date than the latter, is contained in the famous History, or rather Essays on Historical Subjects, \u901a\u5fd7, by Cheng Ts'iao (\u912d\u6a35), 1108-1162 A.D. The statistics given by Cheng Ts'iao are of some interest, showing the great increase of characters, especially of the phonetic class, from the Han to the Sung period. The sum total of all characters known at his time he gives as 24,235. Of these, nearly 22,000, or nine-tenths, were phonetic, and all five other classes contained together only 2,425, or one-tenth of the whole. All the characters in K'ang Hi's Dictionary, exclusive of duplicate forms, amount to 41,000: the percentage of phonetic and ideographic characters is unknown to me. Dr. Marshman, however, gives the number of phonetic elements, or primitives, as 4,081. As he calculates the average derivatives as less than 10, we get a total sum of about 39,000 to 40,000 phonetic characters. The greatest number of derivatives from one primitive is 74, but many primitives are used in only one combination (see Dr. Williams' Dictionary, p. lvii).\n\nCheng Ts'iao's first class contains 608 characters, which are figures, though not all of objects, as symbols of numbers etc. are included, and not all of them simple figures, for many are composite forms. The second class contains 107 characters, which are indicative of a relation or action, as \u4e0a, above, \u4e0b, below. The third class, containing 740 characters, consists of composite forms, which indicate ideas, as sun and moon combined, meaning \"brightness,\" or two trees, indicating \"a forest.\" The fourth class of 372 characters are inverted or otherwise modified forms of the first class. The fifth class contains 21,810 phonetic characters. The sixth class of 598 characters, with borrowed meaning, is outside of the principle\nof form, and, therefore, rather out of place in this classification. We have seen that in 1,000 years from the publication of the Shuow Wen to Cheng's History, about 12,000 phonetic characters were produced. In the following 600 years, from Cheng to K'ang Hi, about 18,000 were added, and from K'ang Hi to the present year we may guess at 8,000 to 10,000 more. Now the legions of scientific book translators are exhausting all Chinese and Western resources to swell the number of phonetic characters, if not to a million certainly to beyond a hundred thousand, before the last bell of this century shall have chimed. Then the end will come! if not of the world, certainly of such extravagant industry.\n\nChinese Phonetic Writing: its Results for Good and Evil.\n\nWe have already stated, that with the invention of phonetic writing a new period began in China, not only in writing, but also in history. The Chinese mind loosened somewhat, though it could not altogether shake off, the narrow fetters of pictorial writing, and began to soar on its wings. The great classical period, of which Confucius is the centre, was the immediate result. The ancient memoranda were collected and revised, commentating began, standard works on moral philosophy were written, digests appeared of teachings on political economy, on the military arts, on the theory and practice of medicine, and on other practical subjects. But it seems that the Chinese mind exhausted nearly all its resources in its classical period. Scarcely any productive power is shown thereafter during so many generations to the present day. There is a deal of reproduction, of collecting of old materials, and, alas, of much old rubbish, of commentating, and of antiquarian\nresearch, but the ideal of everything is looked for and found in sayings of the classical period. The introduction of Buddhism had little effect, and all efforts to infuse new life into fossilized forms by means of Western science, which have already been going on for three hundred years, have increased confusion and cannot have any other result in the future. New characters and new combinations of characters have to be coined in such numbers that translators find it already more convenient to leave unnoticed what predecessors have done and invent their own terms. Chinese written characters can by the phonetic method certainly be increased to hundreds of thousands, we may even say ad infinitum. But of what use is writing when other people are unable to read what is written? Writing can communicate my thoughts to other persons only when they attach the same meaning as I do to the visible signs put in their hands. We cannot here enter into a discussion of the principles of education and of the methods of teaching which are in close connection with this subject, but may refer to another point. In the Chow Li, xxxviii, 26, under the department of the Tu Hing Jen (\u5927\u884c\u4eba), who had to receive strangers of the first and second rank paying visits to the Court, a regulation is mentioned, that every seventh year the interpreters were to be summoned to report on the language and fix the form of addresses (\u8ad6\u8a00\u8a9e\u5354\u8f9e\u547d); and every ninth year the blind [music-masters] and the secretaries were to be summoned to report on the written characters and fix their pronunciation (\u8ad6\u66f8\u540d\u807d\u8072\u97f3). If this regulation had been carried out, a standard of writing and of pronunciation would have been the result. It is a painful sight to an intelligent observer to notice the present confusion of Chinese written characters and the toil it causes to millions of people, with immense waste of time and energy to the nation. We are convinced that the present slow progress of China, even the impossibility\nof any more rapid movement is to be found in its system of education based on these confused masses of written characters. We are further convinced by the application of established principles of political economy, that this Chinese mode of writing implies a loss to China of hundreds, if not thousands, of millions of dollars a year. We are, moreover, satisfied that Chinese writing and cultivation of Western science cannot possibly go hand-in-hand. Chinese writing in phonetic-pictorial characters should be used exclusively as an excellent means of communication between merchants, and also by officers of government in their proclamations and notices to the people. It might be improved upon and become a Universal Mode of Writing in those limited branches, probably better than Volap\u00fck. This subject, however, is beyond our present scope.\n\nPeriod of Pictorial Writing, or Primary Period.\n\nThe phonetic principle, as already mentioned, never gained exclusive control of writing in China. It became one element, and soon enough a very important element, but it remained attached to the ancient pictorial writing. This is the peculiarity of Chinese writing. It is not a phonetic system depending on articulate sounds only, but a combination of a new method, indicating pronunciation, with an older method, indicative of figures of things. All the written characters (primitives) used by the phonetic method, to indicate the pronunciation of words, were in existence and in circulation before phonetic writing began in China. These phonetic elements or primitives consequently represent an earlier period of writing. All characters which contain no indication of sound in their\nformation belong to this class. As we have found that the phonetic period of writing began during the Chow dynasty, between 1200 and 800 B.C., we get for the earlier period, i.e. for Pictorial, or rather Ideographic, Writing, an indefinite time before these dates. Though many characters have changed their forms so much in the course of time that their original shape is no longer recognizable, we can easily convince ourselves that no character once in general use could have been lost. This means, that every character of ancient pictorial writing that was in use more than 3,000, perhaps 4,000, years ago is still preserved in the Chinese written character of the present day.\n\nLeaving alone the phonetic class and directing our attention to the earlier period of writing, we again discover without difficulty two distinct periods of pictorial writing. The first and earliest must have been the formation of certain simple figures, primary characters, which I shall call \"Elementary Characters.\" They form the basis of all Chinese written characters, and are of a limited number, only about a hundred. It is possible that a person called somewhat like Tsang Hieh made the first attempt at writing such characters about 4,000 years ago, but other persons must have followed in his line. After the inventors had produced as many elementary characters as they conveniently could, and when the need of expressing more in writing was felt, the period of manipulating them, i.e., of modifications and combinations, began. This is the period of the formation of secondary characters. The elementary characters are analogous to the roots of other languages; all secondary characters are derivations. These secondary characters, which I call ideographic, combine three groups of the Six Scripts into one. We are, however, not sure that all ideographic characters found in Kang Hi's Dictionary have originated in the time before 1200 B.C., some may be much later. I should accept as ancient primitives only such as entered.\nthe list of phonetics us early as the time of the Shuoh Wen. Their use in the Shuoh Wen is a proof that such modifications, or such combinations, were already recognized in their meaning and pronunciation some time before the Shuoh Wen was written. We have now, as the result of our investigations, three important facts:\u2014(1st). That all the written Chinese characters form three layers\u2014a primary of elementary characters, a secondary of ideographic, and a tertiary of phonetic characters; (2). That the tertiary, or last formation, far outnumbers the other two; (3). That all Chinese literature, without even one exception, belongs to the tertiary period.\n\nPeriod of Ideographic Characters, or Secondary Period.\n\nIdeographic writing may have been in use for several centuries, perhaps even for ten or fifteen centuries. We are unable to determine the length of its reign as we have no reliable facts to guide our reasoning. We are, however, quite sure that such a period existed, and that there must still be remnants of it in the form of inscriptions in stone and in metal. If excavations were begun and scientifically prosecuted in China as in Egypt and other ancient countries, we might soon get plenty of materials to shed light on the prehistoric period of China. The only accessible mine open to the study of ancient Chinese writing since A.D. 100, is the dictionary Shuoh Wen, already referred to. We may suppose that in the Shuoh Wen all ideographic characters still in currency at the time became incorporated. It is even most probable that no ideographic character was allowed to be forgotten, because the Chinese phonetic system was not at all inimical to such forms, and ideographic writing is more pleasing to human fancy, and cannot be forgotten as easily as other forms\nof writing. Though the Shuow Wen furnishes plenty of materials, yet we have to deplore one serious deficiency. All the ideographic characters are isolated; we do not find a sentence composed of such characters. It may be that a few such sentences are incidentally contained in the Shuow Wen or in other ancient writings, but we have so far not had the good fortune to discover them. A discovery of that kind would be of great interest in several respects. A complete list of all ideographic characters would also be of value, and might be the preliminary step to more important discoveries.\n\nWe can give here only a few examples of simple forms. The ninth classifier \u4eba is meant as a representation of \"man.\" The ancient figure \u4eba is not much better, though useful in tracing the different derivations. This figure of man \u4eba turned round in this way \u53c8 is the twenty-first classifier, now written \u53c8, meaning \"a spoon,\" perhaps originally \"fed with a spoon.\" When put on its back (\u53c8) it becomes classifier 44\u2014a corpse\u2014now written \u53c8. When put on its head (\u53c8)\u2014hands and feet turned up and decomposing\u2014it means \"change,\" now written \u53c8. The same turned round (\u53c8) means \"self-destruction,\" now written \u53c8. Then we find a simple line added, as in classifier 34, present form \u53c8, ancient form \u53c8\u2014a man's two legs pushed on from behind\u2014slowness. The same reversed (\u53c8)\u2014a man using all the power of his legs\u2014wide steps, overstriding\u2014now written \u53c8. Further we find \u53c8\u2014representing a man driven on from behind, therefore, enduring, continuing\u2014now = \u53c8. The classifier 35 \u53c8, old style \u53c8, represents a man calmly walking, dragging a staff.\n\nThere are a still larger number of combinations with other simple figures. For example, \u53c8\u2014a man under shelter, reduced to straits, inclining\u2014now written \u53c8 or \u53c8. Then the reverse of it \u53c8, now written \u53c8\u2014to turn round. \u53c8, now \u53c8, from \"man\" and \"a burden\"\u2014a man carrying a burden,\nfatigued. \u8cbb, now \u8cbb\u2014countenance, from \"face\" and \"man.\"\n\n\u898b=\u898b, classifier 147\u2014to see and already reach it; from \"eye\" and \"man.\" \u898b=\u898b, classifier 138, is the reverse of the former\u2014to see again and again (probably without being able to reach the object). \u898b=\u898b, from \"head with bones not yet closed\" and \"man\"\u2014a new-born child. \u898b=\u898b, classifier 181, from \"head\" and \"man\"\u2014a head-man. \u898b=\u898b, from \"mortar\" and \"man\"\u2014the momentary rest in working at the mortar; a moment. \u898b=\u898b\u2014two men making compliments with their hands one to the other\u2014face-to-face. \u65e5=\u65e5, from \"sun\" and \"one\" (i.e., horizon)\u2014the rising sun. \u65e5=\u65e5, the sun and moon rising and setting\u2014to alternate, exchange.\n\n\u65e5=\u65e5, the male principle (the sun), the mate of the female (the moon). \u65e5, the light of the sun and moon united\u2014splendid, bright. \u65e5=\u65e5, from the moon and a star, clear sky\u2014because they are seen after rain. \u65e5=\u65e5, the sun seen above the trees\u2014bright. \u65e5=\u65e5, the sun seen in the midst of trees\u2014east. \u65e5=\u65e5, the sun seen under trees, indicating the evening near sunset\u2014obscure. \u65e5=\u65e5, three suns\u2014the brilliancy of crystal or gems. \u65e5=\u65e5, the sun sinking into the ocean and becoming lost to vision; total loss (Untergang).\n\nIn order to show the difficulty of analysing some of the complicated characters, one example may suffice. The character \u8cbb (hiang) means \"a noise.\" It is composed of the classifier 180\u2014sound\u2014and the phonetic hiang, meaning \"village.\" The character itself thus belongs, as a phonetic, to the tertiary period. Its component parts, however, both belong to the secondary or ideographic period. \u8cbb is from \u8cbb, classifier 163, also written \u8cbb, and this is repeated back-to-back, as \u8cbb is nothing but \u8cbb turned round in ancient writing. \u8cbb is composed of \u8cbb, classifier 31\u2014an enclosure, and \u8cbb, classifier 26\u2014a seal\u2014referring to the patents given to feudal princes. The middle portion of the character, \u8cbb is read p'ei and composed of \u767d\u2014white, and \u5319\u2014a spoon.\nK'ang Hi explains it by \"fragrant grain,\" \"fragrance,\" \"one grain.\" Thus we arrive at the original meaning of this ideographic combination of primitives\u2014a space between two towns, filled with the fragrance of meals from both sides. The classifier \u9999 of the character under examination is composed of \u8a00\u2014words, placed over \u542b\u2014to hold in the mouth; both these characters are contracted or amalgamated. \u8a00 is composed of \u53e3\u2014mouth, and \u5341, old form for \u7f6a\u2014crime. \u5341 is composed of \u5343\u2014a shield and \u4e00\u2014one. \u542b is from \u53e3\u2014mouth, and \u4eca\u2014now, above it. \u542b is formed of \u4eba\u2014men, coming into \u4e00\u2014one place (=\u96c6\u2014collected together) and \u53ca\u2014up to, contracted. \u53ca is composed of the classifier 29 (\u53c8)\u2014hand or having, and \u5165\u2014num, which means, to follow a man till he is taken. Thus we are brought into a meeting of rioters where rebellious speeches are delivered till the arm of the police reaches the culprits; the noise is, of course, like that of a yelling Chinese mob, resounding from the hills\u2014that is \"sound\" in Chinese ideographic writing, and has become the classifier for all noises, and even of softer voices, in the Flowery Kingdom.\n\nThis one example may suffice to show that for an analysis of Chinese ideographic characters their present form is useless, and their most ancient form is required. Even ancient forms are not in every case perspicuous, therefore a dangerous field is left to imagination: contractions are supposed to have taken place, which may be referred to a dozen or more different characters.\nAnother difficulty we meet with in analysing Chinese written characters is caused by the classifiers. They only came into use in, and were necessitated by, the tertiary or phonetic period of writing. There was no need of classifiers in the secondary or ideographic period; the picture explained, or at least indicated, its own meaning. As soon, however, as an isolated sound was conveyed to the reader, he had to receive some more help, as the monosyllabic character of the Chinese language and the limited number of syllables available compelled people to use one and the same syllable to convey different meanings. A glance into any syllabic dictionary will suffice to show the necessity of an addition of classifiers to the phonetics. The classifier then helped to arrange all known characters in the dictionary. But as in the formation of tertiary characters no systematic idea guided the adoption of any character to be used as a primitive, so also no scientific method assisted afterwards the dictionary-makers to select the most significant element of each compound character as its classifier. There are difficulties especially in regard to the ideographic characters which also had to be put under classifiers. The Shuoh Wen is the first attempt of this kind we know of, and has kept its ground to the present day. Though K'ang Hi's arrangement under 214 classifiers is an improvement on the Shuoh Wen with its 540, still there is room for further improvement. The number of classifiers should be no more than about one hundred, which could be managed without serious difficulty. Mr. Wade considers 47 classifiers as obsolete. As we have, however, already called attention to this point (p. 157), two illustrations will suffice for our purpose. Take,\nfor example, the common character \u771f\u2014true; you will naturally first try to find it under the classifier \u4eba (10), but find yourself disappointed; you then try \u4e03 (21), with the same result; and will at last discover it with astonishment under \u76ee (109). Of another kind is the character \u667a\u2014intelligence. This is found under the classifier \u96e8\u2014rain. The remaining part of the character is not a phonetic, but has to be explained ideographically\u2014sorcerer and three months, i.e., three sorcerers praying for rain. In the Shuoh Wen, \u96e8 (sorcerer) is classifier, the remaining portion of the character is then phonetic \u96e8\u2014\u96f6 (ling)\u2014a gentle rain\u2014and the explanation is, a sorcerer producing rain by offering gems to the gods. As, however, the character \u96e8 is no longer used as a classifier, the best choice between \u96e8 (173) and \u53e3 (30) was certainly the first. Rain is regarded as the result of the magical power of sorcery.\n\nThe Elementary Characters.\n\nWe have already noticed that the secondary period of writing was ideographic, and that each ideographic character was either a transmutation of a simple character previously in existence, or the combination of two or several of such simple characters into one compound character. This compound character had, as a rule, a different pronunciation as well as a different meaning from any of its component parts. Wherever one part has the same pronunciation as the whole, we cannot be sure that such character does not belong to the tertiary or phonetic period.\n\nWe have also to take into account that the classifiers, though all of them in existence during the secondary period, are not all simple characters, but that some are compound, even in a\nvery complicated way. Still, almost all elementary characters, with very few exceptions, such as \u4e01\u2014mil, \u4e39\u2014red, etc., are contained in the present list of 214 classifiers. If they contained such elementary characters only, the term \"radicals\" would be very appropriate, as pointing to the root or origin of written characters. But as more than one-half of their number are not roots, but derivatives, we cannot call them radicals. For this reason the term \"radicals\" is not used at all in this paper. It might be employed to designate such characters as form simple figures not reducible to a simpler form, but it seemed better to call them \"elementary\" characters, in order to avoid any confusion. The elementary characters are all simple characters, which may form elements of other (compound) characters, but they themselves do not contain any other element; they are figures pure and simple.\n\nMost of our readers will be greatly astonished to learn that the number of such elementary characters, out of which the 50,000 Chinese characters of modern times have been developed, is not more than about 100. We cannot give the exact number, as some apparently simple characters remain doubtful. Some meaningless characters, such as classifiers 8, 11, 23, and a few mere strokes, such as classifiers 2 and 4, of which the Shuoh Wen has about a dozen, we may leave out of consideration without making any excuse. Somewhat of a difficulty, however, are\u2014\n\nThe Signs for Numbers and the Cyclical Characters.\n\nFour characters designating numbers are still among the classifiers (1, 7, 12, 24), i.e., the characters for the numbers one, two, eight and ten. In the Shuoh Wen, all the signs of numbers, from one to ten inclusive, are used as classifiers. These figures for numbers seem simple figures, and are certainly very ancient, perhaps more ancient than most of the\nideographic characters, but, as they are not figures of objects, we have to regard them also as ideographic. Numbers are abstractions, not real things, and as abstractions they cannot belong to a primitive period of human history. As most of the signs for numbers, for example \u4e00\u3001\u4e8c\u3001\u4e09\u3001\u56db\u3001\u4e94\u3001\u516d\u3001\u4e03\u3001\u516b\u3001\u4e5d\u3001\u5341\u3001\u767e, remain inexplicable from Chinese sources, we suppose that they were adopted by the ancient Chinese from somewhere else, probably from Western countries. The same opinion we venture to express in regard to the cyclical characters, i.e., the ten stems and the twelve branches. We doubt much that the second stem \u5b50 (tsz) and the classifier 39 were originally identical, as they appear now. All Chinese explanations are unsatisfactory and leave the subject in greater obscurity. Why came there in use two parallel lines of numbers from one to ten, as the ten stems and the symbols for the first ten numbers? To what phenomena in nature do the twelve branches refer? to the twelve months of a year, or to the returnings of Ursa major, as a passage in the Li-ki indicates? Chinese tradition mentions that Ta Nao (\u5927\u6320), a minister of the Yellow Emperor, was the inventor of the cyclical characters. Even this statement leaves undecided the question whether he was regarded as the original inventor of the symbols, which are also ascribed to the Heavenly Majesty (see below), or merely as the combiner into sixty of the already existing characters in the ten and twelve lists, so as to give separate marks to each member of a period of sixty.\n\nThe Elementary Characters in Natural Groups.\n\nThough we cannot yet construct a complete list of elementary characters, nor can we expect, for obvious reasons, to see such a list finished before the end of this\ncentury, still we venture to proceed with our materials, in the conviction that all future additions will only amount to a very small number, and that none of them will be of such importance as to endanger our conclusions. The numbers refer to K'ang Hi's list of 214 classifiers.\n\n### TABLE OF ELEMENTARY CHARACTERS IN NATURAL GROUPS.\n\n#### Group I.\u2014Relating to MAN.\n\n(Total 23 Characters.)\n\nThe characters marked * are not included in the number of 214 classifiers.

preserved in the Shuow Wen, needs only to be mentioned. The Small Seal characters of the Shuow Wen, again, being about 900 years later than Chow's work on the Great Seal characters, differed so much from these, that scholars well acquainted with the later form could not make out the older. There was an interminable controversy going on in China for several hundred years. It was about two different texts of some of the ancient Classics. The first was written in characters used at the time, the Small Seal, by an old scholar, Fuhsang. Another scholar, K'ung Gian-kwo, proclaimed afterwards the discovery of another set of books in a wall of Confucius' house. This was in ancient characters, tadpole style, and could only be deciphered by the help of Fuhsang's books and other resources. (See Legge, Chinese Classics, III, i, p. 22). This statement is certainly false. Confucius and his disciples wrote in the Great Seal characters, the ancient tadpole writing being altogether out of the question. But it may be that the handwriting was illegible (tadpole), being, perhaps, the hasty copy of a scholar who made it for his own use to assist his memory when lecturing to his pupils. Another discovery of ancient tablets was made in a grave in A.D. 279. They had been buried for 595 years (Legge, p. 106). As they are said to have been written in the Small Seal character, which was invented 90 years after the supposed burial of those tablets, we see how unreliable such statements are.\n\nThe discovery of the so-called \"Tablet of Yu,\" in the 13th century A.D., about 3,500 years after its supposed origin, Legge (Chin.Cl., III, i, p. 73 ff.) calls \"a romance,\" with which\nI agree for brevity's sake [compare, however, the last section of this paper]. In some editions of the Six Scripts a great variety of ancient forms of characters is collected, but most of these forms are fanciful, and not original. I think, however, that most elementary characters are simple enough, even in the Small Seal form. The original form was certainly nothing but a crude outline of the figure of its object. Of all editions of the Six Scripts one entitled \u516d\u66f8\u5206\u985e mentioned before, I found most useful. As of many different forms of characters, that of the Shuoh Wen is always put first, it seems to indicate that the author considered it the most ancient form of all he could find. There are in circulation a large number of native works on the Antiquities of China, some of them beautifully illustrated. They also contain inscriptions in various forms of ancient characters. Some of them are attributed to periods even before the Chow dynasty, to the Hia and Shang dynasties, 2200-1200 B.C. There is, however, no foundation whatever for such assumption. Chinese authors are too much influenced by their well-known tendency to attach the utmost antiquity to any old relic of uncertain date. Most of the inscriptions in question are written in characters which are apparently but variations of the Small Seal characters. This fact proves that they are not older than the Han dynasty and some of them may be of a still more recent date. We also know of many counterfeits of old things. The trade in relics of antiquity\u2014old cash and porcelain included\u2014is too remunerative not to tempt the ingenuity of artisans. A good museum of articles of Chinese antiquity, where one relic could be compared with a number of other articles of the same period, and one period with other periods, is necessary for satisfactory research. Mere descriptions are insufficient, even when accompanied by drawings.\n\nThus we have to state, as the result of our examination of the subject, that the Small Seal characters of the Shuoh Wen are\nthe most ancient forms of Chinese written characters accessible with certainty at present, of more ancient forms nothing reliable being known. [Compare the remarks on the \"stone drums,\" on a later page.]\n\nThe Original Pronunciation of the Elementary Characters.\n\nSpeech was before writing. All the elementary characters are pictures of objects known to the people and named by the people long before an attempt was made at writing. We may even suppose that speech had already had a history, had passed through changes of sounds and of grammar (construction of sentences). As we have to place the formation of the elementary characters before 1200 B.C., we may say with confidence that the pronunciation of those characters, i.e., the spoken language which their pronunciation represents, must belong at least to the time about 2000 B.C. Neither the elementary nor the ideographic characters, however, indicate in the least a pronunciation, and nothing else is known of that remote age. The case seems hopeless. But there are two ways still open for approaching its solution. One is by examining their use as phonetics (primitives), the other by comparing the ancient rhymes. Though by the rhymes we can only get the final, including the vowel, but never the initial, yet we can find the initials by means of the character's use as a phonetic. The phonetics as such, taken separately from the classifiers, have never been made a subject of study by [native] Chinese scholars. A good deal of attention, however, has been paid to rhymes. The phonetics had no practical interest for the Chinese, but the rhymes had, for writing poetry and gaining\nhonors. The *T'ang y\u00fcn* (\u5510\u97fb) is the earliest dictionary arranged according to tones and final sounds still in existence. It was first published in 750 A.D., but is based on an earlier work\u2014*Tsie y\u00fcn* (\u5207\u97fb), of the Sui dynasty, 589-618 A.D. All characters are arranged under 206 finals. The Kwang y\u00fcn (\u5ee3\u97fb) and the Tsi y\u00fcn (\u96c6\u97fb), published in the Sung period, followed the same arrangement. The finals were reduced to 160, and the initials to 36, which made their first appearance in the \u4e94\u97f3\u96c6\u97fb during the Kin dynasty, 1115-1234 A.D. Many other varieties of the same system may be found mentioned in Wylie's Notes.\n\nOne modern work of this kind, however, which is almost universally used among the Chinese, deserves more attention. I refer to the *Wu fang yuan y\u00fcn* (\u4e94\u65b9\u5143\u97f3) by Fan Tung-fung (\u6a0a\u9a30\u9cf3), first published in 1710, followed by a revised edition in 1810. All finals (\u97fb) are reduced to 12 categories:\u2014(1), \u5929, ien, \u016bn, \u0101n; (2), \u5165, in, \u0101n, \u0101m; (3), \u9f8d, ung, ang, ing; (4), \u7f8a, \u014dng, \u014dng, \u014dng, \u014dng, \u014dng; (5), \u725b, \u016bn, \u016bn; (6), \u5b30, \u014dn, \u014dn, \u014dn; (7), \u864e, n; (8), \u99dd, n; (9), \u86c7, ie, e; (10), \u99ac, a; (11), \u8c82, ai, ai, ai; (12), \u5730, i, ni, \u016b, \u016b. Of initials (\u5b57\u6bcd) only 20 are used:\u2014(1), \u68c9, p; (2), \u9b4f, p'; (3), \u6728, m; (4), \u98a8, j; (5), \u6597, t; (6), \u571f, r; (7), \u9ce5, n; (8), \u96f7, l; (9), \u7af9, rh; (10), \u866b, ch; (11), \u77f3, sh; (12), ll, y; (13), \u526a, ts; (14), \u9d3f, ts'; (15), \u7d72, s; (16), \u96f2, j; (17), \u91d1, k; (18), \u6a4b, k'; (19), \u706b, h; (20), \u86d9, w. Of these, Nos. 2, 6, 10, 14 and 18 are merely aspirates.\n\nThe ancient rhymes have been particularly examined by prominent modern scholars. Ku Yen-wu (\u9867\u708e\u6b66) (Mayers, 281) A.D., 1613-1682, reduced all the rhymes of the Book of Odes\u2014i.e., of China before Confucius\u2014to ten, without reference to tones. They are (1), ung, \u014dng; (2), i, ini, ni, \u014dh, uh, ah, eh, ih, etc.; (3), \u016b, \u016bn; (4), \u016bn, \u016bn, \u016bn; (5), in, en; (6), o; (7), \u014dng; (8), \u014dng, \u014dng; (9), \u014dng?; (10), am, om, im.\nKiang Yung (\u6c5f\u6c38), 1680-1762, divided Nos. 4, 5 and 10 into two each, thus distinguishing altogether 13 finals. Twan Mow-tung (\u6bb5\u8302\u5802), same as Twan Y\u00fc-tsai (Mayers, 694), A.D. 1735-1815, distinguished 17 finals:\u2014(1), e; (2), eao, iau; (3), in; (4), an; (5), n; (6), ang; (7), im, ip; (8), am, ap; (9), ung; (10), ang; (11), ing; (12), in, it; (13), un; (14), an; (15), ei; (16), i; (17), o. He also distinguished three tones observed in rhyming, thus really getting 42 rhymic endings. (Legge, Vol. IV, p. 102.)\n\nThese researches by eminent Chinese scholars, valuable as they are, show that the Chinese do not yet agree among themselves in regard to ancient pronunciation. They also exhibit one weak point, i.e., they all take the Book of Odes as a work uniform in all its parts. This is mere fiction. The different odes were composed in different states of ancient feudal China, and the language of those states differed considerably; there are, besides, centuries between the dates of different odes. We know, further, that in rhyming a deal of poetical license is taken. Another work of the Han dynasty is still preserved, with the title Fang Yin (\u65b9\u8a00), by the famous Yang Hiung (\u694a\u96c4), which enters somewhat into the difference of the then existing Chinese dialects. But we should know the language, and especially the pronunciation of the Han period, spoken by Yang Hiung. We go astray in attaching a modern pronunciation to the Chinese characters used by him and other writers of that period. Some transliterations of Sanskrit terms used in Buddhist translations made at the time may possibly help us out of the difficulty. As, however, I cannot at present give so much time to this subject as would be required to arrive at definite results, I think it wiser to pass it over. I, however, here acknowledge my obligation to Dr. Edkins for kindly enriching the list of Elementary Characters with their ancient pronunciation. As Dr. Edkins\nhas given many years of careful study to Chinese philological questions, his judgment in this line must be of great value to every Chinese student.\n\nThe Elementary Characters and Comparative Philology.\n\nThe great importance of this list of Elementary Characters for researches into the prehistoric period of mankind may be illustrated by one example. I select from among the animals the pig, as the one found in almost every household all over China from the remotest antiquity to the present day. It is the most appreciated and popular of all mammalia among the Chinese. We know that the reverse is the case among Mahomedan nations. The Mahomedan aversion to the pig is, however, derived from the Mosaic prohibition. The law of Moses, though in other respects diametrically opposed to Egyptian usages, shows in its bearing on the pig a perfect agreement with ancient Egyptian practice. We are told by the best Egyptologists that the pig was not domesticated in the first period of Egyptian civilisation. (See Die Anf\u00e4nge der Cultur, von Fran\u00e7ois Lenormant). Egyptian religion regarded the pig as absolutely unclean; even an accidental touch of it subjected the unfortunate person to the strictest purification ceremonies. The pig was domesticated in later periods, especially in Lower Egypt, where foreign tribes had settled.\n\nThe ancient Egyptian language has two words for pig, the one\u2014rer, Koptic rir\u2014is apparently onomatopoeic, an imitation of the voice of the pig, the other\u2014schaau, Koptic esch\u014d\u2014is of foreign origin and is in close connection with the common\nexpressions for pig in the Arian languages. It is in Greek \u03c3\u03cd\u03ba\u03b7, \u1f00\u03c1\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6; Latin sus, Anglo-Saxon s\u016bg, Scandinavian syr, German sau, English sow, Swedish so, Gaelic, suig, Kymeric, horeh; Kornic, horch, (English hog), Persic sch\u0101k, Armenian chau, Lithuanian tr\u016bka, Russian tehuchku. The origin of these words may be discovered in the Sanskrit g\u0101kara\u2014the animal that makes gu, which \"grunts.\" Not without interest is the other fact that the Turanian languages derive their designations for \"pig\" from the same Arian root. In Finnian it is iku, Esthie siqua, Tcheremissian s\u016bsma, Baschkirie suska, Telentic sehosehka, Kirgisian tehutehka, Tshumaie sysma, Samojedic soia. That the Chinese name chi or chu also belongs to this series needs no demonstration.\n\nIf we had a comparative table of the Turanian languages spoken at present, and their ancient pronunciations so far as they can be determined, we might probably discover in the ancient pronunciation of the elementary characters the connecting root of the diverging branches of the Indo-Chinese languages, and perhaps find also a key to the better understanding of the difficult Turanian family in its totality. It is only by methodical study of critically-sifted materials that we can hope to penetrate the darkness of China's remote antiquity. Superficial similarities are always misleading, and mere guesses, though some may be correct enough, cannot dispel doubt and obviate ridicule. There is yet another difficulty too much overlooked. We speak of the Chinese language as if it were the same all over China, and of ancient pronunciation as if there had been only one at any given time. But the fact is, that the differences in language of the various parts of ancient China were greater than at present. There was less mixture of the population, and intercourse was more limited. Further, there are sufficient indications that the people of Hia, of Shang and of Chow were different tribes, if not different nations, that invaded China. Many proper\nnames in ancient Chinese literature seem of foreign origin, as also some names of places. The language and traditions of the different aboriginal tribes, including Miaotsz, Lolas, Sifan and others, which may be regarded as remnants of the natives of ancient China, are as yet almost unknown. The thought that something could be learned from such sources has never entered the mind of a Chinese scholar, therefore the information obtainable from native literature amounts to nothing.\n\nState of Prehistoric Chinese Civilisation Revealed by the Elementary Characters.\n\nFrom the first group in the list given on p. 171 we learn that human society was already in a settled state. A chief was prominent in the community, and he had officers to support his dignity and carry out his orders. [The character for minister (classifier 83), however, remains somewhat doubtful.] The chief lived in organised family-connexions (clans); these became gradually important factors in Chinese history. All subjects, we may suppose, were considered as mere individuals. Every family- (or better, clan-) name of the Chinese can be traced back to some noble family of ancient China. The characters in the second group contain names for animals of all the great natural orders, and the principal kinds of domesticated animals are specially distinguished. This fact shows that the human mind was already conscious of its power over nature. It was a great step in civilisation to have brute creatures subdued and, by a kind of training, taken into the service of man. It is peculiar that sheep and goats were denoted\nby one and the same character. The difference between these two kinds of ruminantia, especially in a wild state, is not so marked in mountainous districts; it may also be an indication that large herds of sheep were not held at the time. Species of wild sheep and goats have been discovered in the north-western provinces of China, as also some of the bovine kind. Wild horses can still be seen on the grassy plains of Tartary, but they may have galloped about the vast uncultivated portions of ancient China. Wild pigs are frequent in all parts of modern China, and the rearing of the domesticated kind is more extensively carried on here than in any other part of the world. Dogs are not only used as faithful guardians of dwelling-houses, but their flesh has been utilized as food from very ancient times. There are, however, indications in ancient Chinese literature that in those days the use of animal flesh [classifier 130] was confined to sacrificial ceremonies. Tigers are still the terror of the southern and middle provinces of China. Other animals of prey are expressed in the general term [classifier 153] \"crawling beast.\" Of fish, the carp is the representative, which proves that the writers lived away from the ocean, else they would certainly have chosen some striking form of sea-fish. Which kind of shell is meant by classifier 154 cannot be determined now; it is probably not the common cowrie. A pig's head, with its snout turned up, is represented by classifier 58. This can be explained only by its use as a sacrifice. To religious usage also points classifier 25, the veins of the tortoise-shell, which were made visible by burning over fire, and served the purpose of divination. The skins of animals were already known to be of particular value. Long hair and feathers were also utilized. The produce of the silkworm was known as \"floss-silk.\" Though the elementary characters give no indication of its use in weaving, still different kinds of silk-manufactures have been known in China from the remotest antiquity.\nIn the third group, relating to plants, we get only six characters, and even of these, two are better transferred to the ideographic class. Of the four remaining characters, two are of a very general meaning. The \"sprout\" is most characteristic of the vegetable kingdom; it may be taken as identical with \"plant\" or may be confined to all plants of the smaller kind, as herbs, grasses, etc. The other character, classifier 75, means \"trees with a woody stem, wood,\" embracing almost all plants of a taller kind. We see that the common botanical distinction between trees and herbs had been noticed and fixed even in prehistoric times. That, however, among the thousands of different kinds of plants growing in China, only bamboo and melon were honoured with special elementary characters, must have been due to some special reason. What species of the cucurbitaceous order is really meant, whether a cucumber, a gourd or a melon, remains undecided, as the flora of the regions along the Yellow River is still insufficiently known. I think melon very probable, though the gourd was also known, according to very ancient records, and its hard skull was used as a vessel for drawing water and for similar purposes. The philosopher Chuang mentions one of immense size. We are, however, quite sure on one point, i.e., that the inventors of Chinese writing had no idea that China would ever be called the \"Flowery Kingdom!\" The bamboo is the real emblem of China. As the greater mass of bamboo is never seen flowering in China, it is impossible to say how many species are growing in different parts of the country. Bamboo appears most luxuriant in the tropical and sub-tropical regions, becoming smaller and scarcer in the northern provinces, and does not reach the northern borders of China (being scarce even on the banks of the Yellow River). It has been used for every imaginable purpose, even from prehistoric times. It is also an article of food, for the bamboo-shoots give a wholesome and agreeable vegetable to myriads of people.\nBamboo-slips were used as perhaps the earliest writing materials in China, till paper was invented. Chinese paper also is made principally of bamboo-fibre. There can be no doubt China is the country of the bamboo!\n\nRemarkable is the meagreness of this group compared with the second\u2014comprising animals. I find in it an unmistakable proof that agriculture was less developed than the breeding of cattle at that time.\n\nIn the fourth group the absence of characters for planets and stars in general is conspicuous. Though some authorities give a character, formed of three dots, as the earliest representation of fixed stars, it soon became supplanted by a phonetic form, if it ever was authorised at all. Bees seem to have been of no unfrequent occurrence, and point to a regular winter-season, as we find it between the Yangtze and Hwang ho. The use of fire was known. As shelters against the inclemency of the weather, tents were not used, but overhanging cliffs, [27-53], which points to a mountainous district where rocks abound. This is confirmed by the very character for \"mountain\" [45]. There was, however, at least some level ground at the foot of the hills and in the valleys, which could be turned into cultivated fields, with channels for irrigation and drainage. The character for \"divided fields,\" not used now as a classifier, but so given in the Shuoh Wen, means a division of a piece of ground into nine squares of equal size. I prefer, however, the meaning of \"a well\" as the original one. It is as such the 48th diagram of the Book of Changes. [Only three of the 64 diagrams of the I-king are represented by elementary characters\u2014the 48th, the 49th, i.e., classifier 177, \"a raw skin,\" and the 50th, i.e., classifier 206, \"a tripod\" used for sacrificial purposes]. This digging of wells must have begun as soon as the people settled in fertile alluvial plains where the river was too far off or too muddy for culinary purposes. In\nhilly districts in Europe wells are found more serviceable than pure springs and streams of flowing water at an inconvenient distance. The special character for \"salt-land\" indicates not the sea-shore, but some salt plain away in the interior. The vast ocean would certainly have received a peculiar character for itself, if the inventors had had the grand aspect before their eyes. Their notion of water was expressed by the form of mountain streams, not by the waves of the sea. The characters referring to \"gems,\" 67 and 96, seem to presuppose some human workmanship\u2014cutting, polishing, etc. \"Red stone\" means probably red sandstone used for building purposes, but it is commonly applied to cinnabar.\n\nThe action of the human mind on nature, or, in other words, nature in the service of mind, is already visible in Group I, in the characters for chief, minister, and family; and in Group II, in the characters for silk, flesh, skin, veins of tortoise-shell, pig's-head, and perhaps in hair and plumes. In Group III, we meet with a tree cut in two through its whole length. In Group IV there is mentioned the use of fire, of cliffs for dwelling-places, cultivation of fields, arrangement of salt-fields, digging of wells, cutting of sandstone and of gems. The human mind is seen in unceasing activity. Though nature is still prominent, it is made to serve human purposes; though the mind is still bound to nature, it nevertheless regulates the course of nature to a certain extent. The characteristic feature of Group V is not only a partial adaptation of natural objects to human wants, but a more or less complete change of their natural condition into an artificial shape. Nature furnishes only the materials, which by human ingenuity are wrought into such forms as are most suitable to human purposes. Thus the human mind assumes gradually dominion over the realms of nature by expanding the limited powers of the human body through the use of ever-improving instruments. Every instrument is the result of an invention,\nand every invention is a victory of Mind over Nature. The weapons, mentioned in Group V, are such as were also in use among other nations in prehistoric times. Of domestic utensils the mortar was used to reduce grain to flour before the easier process of grinding by the millstone was discovered. The artisan's rule with a crosspiece at right angles at one end, the other cross-piece probably moveable to be used as a compass, indicates considerable progress in workmanship. Houses were already made more secure by doors and cheerful by windows. Benches to lean on when sitting on the covered floor added to personal comfort. Enclosures were made for the domesticated animals as a protection against the attacks of beasts of prey.\n\nIt having been observed that after the burning of fires a certain kind of mud became as hard as stone, this discovery was utilised to make bricks and tiles for building purposes. Another step was taken by manufacturing different kinds of household utensils of this waterproof material. We find already vessels used in eating, wine-jars (which implies that some sort of wine was prepared at the time), tripods for cooking and to offer sacrificial meat, incense-cauldrons (implying the preparation and use of fragrant materials). Working in wood was already so far developed that not only rough building was executed, but handy utensils for use on the table and in sacrificing were made. There were even vehicles for locomotion on water, and others for use on dry ground. It was no more a primitive state of civilisation when the ancient Chinese could boast of wheeled carriages and of boats as means of conveyance by land and by water. That wicker-work of bamboo, and perhaps also of grass and of other materials, was manufactured at this period is not surprising. We also find the first traces of fine arts in the instrument for carving wood. Carving was the beginning of ornamentation, embroidery (classifier 204)\ncombined figures and colours, therefore painting cannot have been unknown, as it is the precursor of embroidery. Thus we see even a practical people, as the Chinese are, exhibiting a sense of the beautiful.\n\nThat only two articles of clothing are mentioned may be explained by their use as marks of distinction between the different classes or ranks of society. It is also possible that classifier 145 was originally an elementary character, the figure of a suit of clothes, consisting in a lower garment or a pair of covers for the legs, and in an upper garment with a neckpiece and two sleeves. Towards the end of the Chow dynasty this character was used only for upper garments, called yi; the lower garments were called shang and represented by a phonetic character. As material for their garments the ancient Chinese had at their disposal skins [177], long hair of animals [59], feathers [124], and silk [120], possibly hemp also.\n\nChinese Religion in Prehistoric Times.\n\nThat the Chinese were not without religion, even in those early days, is shown by some of the elementary characters. It may be that the classifier of religious terms [113] belongs to this period, but as it is rather ideographic and could not be otherwise, referring to something invisible, I did not include it in my list. Certain it is that some of the vessels mentioned in Group V were only used for sacrificial purposes. The same must have been the case with the pig's-head [58], as the custom has survived to the present day.\n\nIt is not the place here to enter into a discussion of the deeper meaning of sacrificing. The very act demonstrates\nthat the human being acknowledges a higher personal power above him. The term *personal* is used deliberately, as it would be mere nonsense to offer a sacrifice to an impersonal force. The act of sacrificing also indicates that man considers the higher Being as capable of being influenced in his favour by such action, and is anxious to avoid divine displeasure.\n\nAnother unmistakable proof of Chinese religion at this early period is the character for \"divination\" [25]. By means of divination historic Chinese, just as their prehistoric ancestors did, inquire into the will of the Divine Being. Men must have felt their deep dependence on divine favour for the prosperity of their doings, so that in order to ensure success they first enquired about the divine will and pleasure regarding every undertaking of any importance, private or public.\n\nDivination and offering of sacrifices have their Christian equivalents in doctrine and worship. They will for ever remain manifestations of genuine religious life. May its forms change ever so much, the two religions motives will remain unshaken; first, to learn the divine will; second, to seek divine favour.\n\n**Chinese Accounts of the History of their Earliest Civilization.**\n\nAs the *I-king*, or *Book of Changes*, is the highest authority for everything relating to human affairs among the Chinese, I shall begin with the few statements contained therein. In the Great Appendix (Part ii, Sect. ii; Dr. Legge, p. 382) we read, (1) that in ancient times Pao Hi (commonly placed in the 29th century, B.C.) invented\u2014\nEARLIEST CIVILIZATION.\n\na.\u2014The eight trigrams,\nb.\u2014The knitting of strings into nets of various kinds for hunting and fishing.\n\n(2) That Shin Nung (28th century, B.C.) fashioned wood to form the share, and bent wood to make the plough handle. The advantages of ploughing and weeding were then taught to all under heaven.\n\n(3) That he caused markets to be held at mid-day, thus bringing together all the people, and assembling all their wares in one place. They made their exchanges and retired, every one having got what he wanted.\n\n(4) That Hwang Ti, Yao and Shun (27th to the 23rd centuries, B.C.) simply wore their upper and lower garments [as patterns to the people], and good order was secured to all under heaven.\n\n(5) That they hollowed out trees to form canoes; they cut others long and thin to make oars. Thus arose the benefit of canoes and oars for the help of those who had no means of intercourse with others. They could now reach the most distant parts, and all under heaven were benefited.\n\n(6) That they used oxen [for carts] and\u2014\n\n(7) Yoked horses [to chariots], thus providing for the carriage of what was heavy, and for distant journeys, thereby benefiting all under the sky.\n\n(8) That they made the defence of double gates; and\u2014\n\n(9) the warning of the clapper, as a preparation against the approach of marauding visitors.\n\n(10) That they cut wood and fashioned it into pestles; they dug into the ground and formed mortars. Thus the myriads of the people received the benefit arising from the use of the pestle and mortar.\n\n(11) That they bent wood by means of string so as to form bows, and sharpened wood so as to make arrows. This conferred\nthe benefit of bows and arrows, and served to produce everywhere a feeling of awe.\n\n(12) That in the highest antiquity men made their homes [in winter] in caves, and [in summer] dwelt in the open country. In ages subsequent to these the sages substituted houses with the ridgebeam above and the projecting root below, as a provision against wind and rain.\n\n(13) That when the ancients buried their dead, they covered the body thickly with pieces of wood, having laid it in the open country. They raised no mound over it, nor planted trees around, nor had they any fixed period of mourning. In subsequent ages the sages substituted for these practices the inner and outer coffins.\n\n(14) That in the highest antiquity, government was carried on successfully by the use of knotted cords [to preserve the memory of things]. In subsequent ages the sages substituted for these written characters and bonds. By means of these [the doings of] all the officers could be regulated, and the affairs of all the people accurately examined.\n\nContradictory Accounts of Prehistoric Times.\n\nAlthough the appendix to the I-king is not so ancient as the text of the classic itself, and cannot, from internal evidence, even be inscribed to Confucius, still its author must have been a first-class disciple of Confucius. This appendix is a masterpiece of style and as such highly valued among the literati of China. Its contents, however, are more philosophical than historical, showing the Confucian construction of history. To Yao and Shun many inventions\nare ascribed which in other accounts are put to the credit of other persons. The fact is, that scarcely any two ancient Chinese traditional records agree one with the other. Ancient Taoist writings are full of traditional matters. A very curious account of prehistoric times is found in the 18th book of the Mountain and Sea Classic (\u5c71\u6d77\u7d93). Other statements are found in the works of the philosophers Lih, Chiang, L\u00fc, Wei Nan, etc. It would be waste of time to enter into an examination of their differences, as we have not yet even a clue to these ancient mythological names.\n\nAlmost all traditions relating to Chinese prehistoric times are collected in the work called \u8def\u53f2, in 16 vols. More fantastic, and different in other respects, is the \u795e\u4ed9\u901a\u9451 in 22 vols., with many illustrations. More generally known among men of letters are the statements in modern compilations of Chinese History called \u92fc\u9451. A well-known compendium of this kind is the Tung chow kung kien ts'ien pien (Wylie, p. 21; see von Fries, Geschichte Chinas). From the latter work I extract a few items bearing on our subject:\n\nTien Hwang named the Ten Stems and Twelve Branches.\n\nTi Hwang, who defined Sun, Moon and the Stars as the three lights (\u4e09\u8fb0), distinguished day and night and determined a month as thirty days.\n\nYen Hwang founded cities.\n\nUnder Yu Chao the former peace between men and animals ceased. Men killed them, drank their blood and ate their hair. The animals then used their natural weapons against men.\n\nSui Yen taught how to produce and use fire. He knotted cords to remember things, established markets and commercial exchange.\n\nFuh Hi taught fishing with nets, the domestication of the six kinds of animals (horse, cattle, sheep, chicken, dog, pig) and their use as food. He received the book of the Lo river on the back of a dragon (or horse), from which originated the\neight Trigrams. The art of writing was invented by his minister Ts'ang Hieh.\n\nHis sister N\u00fc Kwa invented the Pan-pipe. Shang ordained matrimony, and presents to be sent to the girl by her lover as the definite form of engagement.\n\nShen Nung taught agriculture. He made implements of wood, distinguished the five sorts of grain, taught other industries, examined medicinal plants and taught their use.\n\nHwang Ti introduced the cycle of sixty days, investigated the five elements, the twelve tones of music, the stars and planets. He had an officer to superintend pottery, and another to look after the production of wooden utensils. Two of his ministers made boats of trees which they hollowed out, fixing masts in them. He distinguished the five colours, he received the phan (arithmetical figures) from the Ho (Yellow river). He took the Great Bear (constellation) as his model and made chariots, he sacrificed to God (\u4e0a\u5e1d) and to the spirits, and taught the people to do so. He melted gold (perhaps metal in general) and used it as a precious article. He built an Imperial palace, wrote a treatise on the medical art, and laid down the theory of the pulse. His wife Si Ling (\u897f\u9675) cultivated the silkworm, and taught how to make clothes from silk. He introduced the agrarian system of the tsing (\u4e95) and other divisions of the country derived therefrom.\n\nYao ordered an intercalary month every third year, determined the five punishments (branding, cutting of the nose, of the feet, castration, and death), and chose a successor, passing over his own unqualified son.\n\nShun organized the administration of government and made the low lands habitable by regulating the water-courses.\n\nY\u00fc, the Great, held the first assembly of feudal princes (\u8af8\u4faf) and made his son his successor, though against his own wish.\nThus hereditary succession commenced in China, which was never afterwards interrupted, except by rebellion and with much bloodshed, about fifty times in 4,000 years, including all the partial successes which lasted only for a few years.\n\nHere we find attributed to Hwang Ti or the Yellow Emperor almost all the most important inventions of Chinese prehistoric times. The principal features of the gradual advancement of Chinese civilization, however, remain the same in the different accounts, and may be taken as representing historical facts. The most striking fact to our readers will be the perfect agreement of these Chinese statements of their earliest civilisation with our deduction of Chinese prehistoric civilisation from the Elementary Characters. This is an incontrovertible evidence of the general correctness of both of them.\n\nCivilization in Ancient China according to the Tribute of Yu.\n\n(See Legge III, A, pp. 92 ff.)\n\nFirst province, Ke, the present Shansi and parts of Chihli (but the provinces cannot be determined exactly. Chinese commentators disagree among themselves considerably):\u2014Wild people of the island brought dresses of skins.\n\nSecond province, Yen, South-Western Shantung and a small portion of Chihli:\u2014Varnish, silk, baskets filled with woven ornamental fabrics.\n\nThird province, Ts'ing, North Shantung:\u2014Salt, fine grass-cloth, various products of the sea, silk, hemp, lead, pine trees, strange stones, wild silk.\n\n*The term \"province\" is rather misleading; \"circit\" would be better.\nFourth province, S\u016b, one department of Shantung, parts of Kiang-su and Ngan-hwei, North of the Yangtze:\u2014Earth of five different colours, variegated feathers of pheasants, solitary dryandra (tung), floating sounding stones, oyster pearls, fish in baskets, deep azure silks, and other silken fabrics, chequered and pure white.\n\nFifth province, Yang, sea-coast, South from the Yangtze:\u2014Metal of three kinds (gold, silver, copper), yao and limestones, bamboo, small and large, ivory, hides, feathers, hair, and timber, garments of grass, woven ornamented silks, oranges and pumeloes.\n\nSixth province, Kang, Central Hu-kwang:\u2014Feathers, hair, ivory, hides, three kinds of metal, the chun tree, wood for bows (kan), cedars, cypresses, grindstones, whetstones, arrow-head stones, cinnamon, two kinds of bamboo, L tree, a kind of rush, deep azure and purple silken fabrics, strings of pearls, great tortoise.\n\nSeventh province, Yu, Honan and a small portion of Hupeh:\u2014Varnish, hemp, fine and coarse hempen cloth, fine silken fabrics, fine floss silk, stones for polishing, sounding stones.\n\nEighth province, Liang, Sze-chuan and part of Kun-suh:\u2014Musical gem stones, iron, silver, steel, stones for arrow-heads, sounding stones, skins of bears, great bears, foxes, and jackals, articles woven with their hair.\n\nNinth province, Yung, Shensi, Kau-su and portions of Sze-chuan:\u2014Ken and lin gem-stones, hang-kan precious stones, hair-cloth and skins.\n\nThis so-called Tribute of Yii shows such an advanced state of civilization that, on this account, we find it impossible to allow it to pass as a description of the period 2200 B.C. It may be correct for the time at the beginning of the Chow dynasty, a thousand years later, but certainly not earlier. In addition to the articles already mentioned as belonging to\nthe prehistoric or earliest period of Chinese civilisation, which we have followed from its beginning to the days of Yao and Shun, the immediate predecessors of Yii the Great, and to Yii himself, we find here mentioned:\u2014skins of two kinds of bears, of foxes and jackals, and articles woven with their hair; varnish from two provinces, Shantung and Honan, fine grass-cloth, garments of grass, wild silk, hemp, fine and coarse hempen cloth; pine trees, cedars, cypresses, tung tree, l' tree, four kinds of bamboo, rush. Arrows were made in primitive times of wood or of bamboo, but here we find mentioned arrow-head stones from Hu-kuang and Szechwan, besides a large number of other stones. Metal [gold] had been mentioned only for its value in exchange, but here we find metals of three kinds [gold, silver and copper] from the sea-coast province, south of the Yangtze, and from Hu-kuang, while special names are given to lead from Shantung, and to iron, silver and steel from Szechwan. Various productions of the sea are also mentioned, but only from Shantung.\n\nOf colours five belonging to the mineral class are mentioned, of dyes, deep azure [indigo?] and purple. The manufacture of silk seems to have centred in Shantung; Hu-kuang, Honan and the islands of Chekiang participating.\n\nDuring the Chow dynasty the laws and government of the feudal states became developed, ceremonies were multiplied and literature flourished, but the general features of civilisation remained almost the same as the Tribute of Yii describes them, even to the end of that dynasty\u2014225 B.C. Those who wish to go more into details in regard to the period just mentioned may read with advantage the admirable essay, by Edouard Biot, \"Researches into the Manners of the Ancient Chinese, according to the She-king,\" published in Legge's Chinese Classics, IV. A, pp. 142 ff.\nThe Nine Circuits according to the Chow Li.\n\nThe term \"circuit\" is used here instead of the common translation of \u90e1 by \"province.\" China had no provinces, in the modern sense, in those early days. The term \"circuit\" is chosen with reference to the tours of inspection made by some of the ancient rulers of China.\n\nChinese critics do not regard the Chow Li as a genuine work of the Chow dynasty, but as a production of the Early Han period. The famous Sung scholars Cheng and Chu already noticed the discrepancies between the Chow Li and Mencius. [See Canton Miscellany, 1831, p. 13.] The views of the best authorities of modern times may be seen in the Imperial Catalogue of the Kien Lung period, the \u6b3d\u5b9a\u56db\u5eab\u5168\u66f8\u7e3d\u76ee, 120 vols.\n\nThe Chow Li, Book xxxiii, which treats of the duties of the Surveyor-General, \u8cea\u65b9\u6c0f, as a department of the Summer-officers, contains a description of the \"Nine Circuits\" similar to that in the Tribute of Yu.\n\nFirst circuit, Yang, [identical with Yu's fifth]. Its source of wealth [\u5229, Biot translates \"merchandise\"] is gold, tin and bamboo arrows [according to commentaries, two kinds of bamboo.\u2014Biot.] Inhabitants, five males to two females. Birds and animals are reared, and rice is grown.\n\nSecond circuit, Kang, [Yu's sixth]. Its resources are cinnamon, silver, ivory, hides. Population, one male to two females. Birds and animals are reared, and rice is grown.\n\nThird circuit, Yu, [Yu's seventh]. Its resources are bamboo-timber, varnish, silk, hemp. Population, two males to three females. The six kinds of domesticated animals are reared, and the five kinds of grain are cultivated.\nFourth circuit, Tsing, [Y\u00fc's third and the fourth, Shu, united with it]. Its resources, rushes [matting grass?] and fish. Population, two males [two probably for three] to two females. Fowls and dogs are reared, and rice and wheat are grown.\n\nFifth circuit, Fen, [Y\u00fc's second]. Its resources, rushes and fish. Population, two males to three females. Six kinds of animals are reared, and four kinds of grain are grown.\n\nSixth circuit, Yang, [Y\u00fc's ninth, and the eighth, Liang, united with it]. Its resources, jade and stones. Population, three males to two females. Cattle and horses are reared, Shu and tsieh millet grown.\n\nSeventh circuit, Yen, [portion of Y\u00fc's first]. Its resources, fish and salt. Population, one male to three females. Four kinds of animals are reared, and three kinds of grain are grown.\n\nEighth circuit, Ke, [Y\u00fc's first]. Its resources, pines and cypresses. Population, five males to three females. Cattle and goats [sheep?] are reared, and two kinds of millet are grown.\n\nNinth circuit, Piag, [portion of Y\u00fc's first]. Its resources, cloth and silken fabrics. Population, two males to three females. Five kinds of animals are reared, and five kinds of grain are grown.\n\nThat silk should be mentioned as a principal article of value in the most northern province is very strange. Native produce is out of the question there, and trade in this article could not have amounted to much with the barbarian inhabitants of Mongolia. The order of the circuits is also unintelligible. Why is Yang the first? Then the jump from Kan-suh [vi] to the Gulf of Pechili [vii] and back again to Shensi [viii]. The account in the Tribute of Y\u00fc is superior in every respect. The status of civilisation which it represents is certainly higher than what the Chow Li exhibits. To maintain that\nthe tribute of Yu is a record written about 2,000 years before the Chow Li appears to me simply impossible. The few changes in the circuits can be easily understood. The division, for example, of Yu's first, or northern, province into three\u2014Yeu, Ke and Ping\u2014as described in the Chow Li, is ascribed to the Emperor Shun, [see Legge, III n, 32]. Why the four western provinces or circuits were united into two, and when, remains to be explained. It is to be noted\u2014and we call special attention to it\u2014that neither iron, steel nor lead, is mentioned in the record of the Chow Li, though all three figure in the \"Tribute of Y\u00fc\" as revenue from several provinces. Thus we declare without hesitation the record in the Chow Li to be an earlier document than the present text of the Tribute of Yu. Further, the modern text of the Tribute of Yu must have been unknown to the compiler of the Chow Li and vice versa. We are justified, by a comparison of both works, to draw the conclusion that they are independent enlargements of a common ancient tradition, consisting almost exclusively of geographical names and statistical notes. But, as the settlement of this question is of little consequence to the subject before us, I leave it for future treatment.\n\nThere are only four other complete tables of the productions of China, in detail for each province, as far as I have been able to find out. The next in order of time belongs to the Tang dynasty, probably of the 8th century A.D. The absurdity of a gap of almost 3,000 years, between the table in the so-called Tribute of Yu and this, needs no further remark. About 1,000 years is all we can allow. Then we find a table from the Sung dynasty, about the 11th century. Another is from the Ming dynasty, 15th century, and the last is given in the \u5927\u6e05\u4e00\u7d71\u5fd7, the statistical recount of China under the Manchu rulers, published in 1744. A r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the latter can be seen in La Chine Moderne, by\nM. G. Pauthier. An intelligent comparison of these different lists would furnish us with a history of both the natural and the industrial productions of China during at least 2,000 years. Another list brought up to date would increase the interest and value of such a comparison.\n\nA List of Ninety-one so-called Ancient Works which are Rejected by Chinese Scholars as Not Authentic.\n\nThis list is taken from a work in one vol., \u53e4\u4eca\u50de\u66f8\u8003, by Yao Shao-yuen (\u59da\u9996\u6e90), of the K'ang Hi period. His views are largely supported by quotations from other scholars. Many more works could be added by going through the 120 volumes of the Imperial Catalogue (K'ien Lung) \u6b3d\u5b9a\u56db\u5eab\u5168\u66f8\u7e3d\u76ee. There is as much forgery of ancient books going on in China as of coins, bronze, porcelain, etc. The Imperial Catalogue, however, shows that Chinese scholars of some eminence are not so credulous as a few foreign Chinese students appear to be. The Roman numbers refer to the Imperial Catalogue, as far as I succeeded in finding these works mentioned therein. The Arabic numbers follow Yao's book.\n\nA.\u2014Classical Works, \u7d93\u985e.\n\n(1).\u2014\u6613\u50b3, the ten appendices to the Yi-king, are essays, not by Confucius, but handed down and altered through generations.\n\n(2).\u2014\u5b50\u590f\u6613\u50b3, not mentioned in the Han Catalogue;\u2014made its first appearance in the Sui Catalogue. [i, 3.]\n(3).\u2014\u95dc\u671d\u6613\u50b3. Mentioned neither in the Sui nor in the T'ang Catalogue;\u2014fabricated during the T'ang dynasty.\n\n(4).\u2014\u9ebb\u8863\u6b63\u6613\u5fc3\u6cd5. A production of the Sung dynasty.\n\n(5).\u2014\u7126\u6c0f\u6613\u6797. After the Eastern (Later) Han. (From A.D. 25-200). [cix. 13.]\n\n(6).\u2014\u6613\u4e7e\u8b8a\u5ea6. A compilation of the Sung dynasty.\n\n(7).\u2014\u53e4\u6587\u5c1a\u66f8. 25 chapters, included in the sacred text of the Shu King, manufactured during the time of the Eastern Ts'in, (A.D. 317-419). [s. xii, 25 ff.]\n\n(8).\u2014\u5c1a\u66f8\u6f22\u5b54\u6c0f\u50b3. The same as No. 7.\n\n(9).\u2014\u53e4\u4e09\u58b3\u66f8. A production of the Sung period.\n\n(10).\u2014\u8a69\u5e8f. Not mentioned in the Han Catalogue;\u2014came to light during the Later Han period from the school of Mon \u6bdb. [xv. 2.]\n\n(11).\u2014\u5b50\u8ca2\u8a69\u50b3. [xvii. 11.] and\n\n(12).\u2014\u7533\u57f9\u8a69\u8aaa. Produced by an author of the Ming dynasty (A.D. 1368-1643).\n\n(13).\u2014\u5468\u79ae. Appeared at the end of the Western Han (B.C. 206-A.D. 24). [s. xix. 2 ff.]\n\n(14).\u2014\u5927\u6234\u79ae. The present work is not Ta's but a later compilation. [xxi. 30.]\n\n(15).\u2014\u5b5d\u7d93. Not taught by Confucius, and its teaching differs from that of Mencius. [xxxii. 23.]\n\n(16).\u2014\u5fe0\u7d93. Doubtless not written by Ma Yung, as asserted. [xcv. 4.]\n\n(17).\u2014\u5b54\u5b50\u5bb6\u8a9e. The present work is not the original, but a compilation by its commentator of the T'ang dynasty. [xcvi. 3.]\n\n(18).\u2014\u5c0f\u723e\u96c5. The present work is not what is mentioned in the Han Catalogue, but a modern compilation. [xliii. 1.]\n\n(19).\u2014\u4e00\u5bb6\u79ae\u5100\u7bc0. A production of recent times. [xxv. 30.]\nB.\u2014Historical Works.\n\n(20).\u2014\u7af9\u66f8\u7d00\u5e74. [xlvii. 1.]\n\n(21).\u2014\u6c72\u51a2\u5468\u66f8. and\n\n(22).\u2014\u7a46\u5929\u5b50\u50b3. These three works, and some others, are said to have been found in a grave in A.D. 284, where they had been deposited for 595 years. Their contents, however, show that they were written after the Han dynasty, probably not long before their discovery. [cxlii. 3.]\n\n(23).\u2014\u664b\u53f2\u4e58 [lxvi. 3.] and\n\n(24).\u2014\u695a\u6aae\u674c are compilations by a scholar of the Yuen dynasty (A.D. 1206\u20131367).\n\n(25).\u2014\u6f22\u6b66\u6545\u4e8b. Ascribed to Pan Ku, with whose writings the contents do not agree. It was made by a Tang scholar. [cxlii. 7.]\n\n(26).\u2014\u98db\u71d5\u5916\u50b3. Ascribed to a Han scholar, but it is the compilation of one of the Ming period. [cxliii. 2.]\n\n(27).\u2014\u897f\u4eac\u96dc\u8a18. Mentioned in the Sui Catalogue, without the name of the author. It is a doubtful work.\n\n(28).\u2014\u5929\u797f\u95a3\u5916\u53f2. Ascribed to a Han scholar, but written by one of the Ming period. [cxxiv. 2.]\n\n(29).\u2014\u5143\u7d93. Said to be written by a Sui scholar, but referred to one of the Sung dynasty. [xlvii. 9.]\n\n(30).\u2014\u5341\u516d\u570b\u6625\u79cb. The old work is long lost, and the modern is a compilation by two Ming scholars. [lxvi. 9.]\n\n(31).\u2014\u9686\u5e73\u96c6 is not by the Sung author to whom it is ascribed.\n\n(32).\u2014\u81f4\u8eab\u9304. A doubtful Taoist production of the Ming period.\n\nC.\u2014Philosophical Works.\n\n(33).\u2014\u9b3b\u5b50. Mentioned in the Han Catalogue. The modern work, however, does not agree with the two works described there. The contents show that it is not earlier, and it is probably later, than the Han period. [cxvii. 1.]\n(34).\u2014\u95dc\u5c39\u5b50. Though mentioned in the Han Catalogue, it is not in the Sui, T'ang, etc., Catalogues; thus lost long ago. The present work savours of Buddhism. [exlvii, 16.]\n\n(35).\u2014\u5b50\u83ef\u5b50. This is probably a Sung falsification, feeble and mean. [exvii 5.]\n\n(36).\u2014\u4ea2\u5009\u5b50, not mentioned by the famous Han scholars, contains extracts from a number of Han publications, but nothing original. [exlxi, 46.]\n\n(37).\u2014\u664f\u5b50\u6625\u79cb. The number of parts does not agree with the work mentioned in the Han Catalogue. It is probably a biography compiled by later writers. [lviii, 5.]\n\n(38).\u2014\u9b3c\u8c37\u5b50. First mentioned in the Sui Catalogue. It contains dangerous doctrines, ruinous to Family and State. [exvii, 12.]\n\n(39).\u2014\u5c39\u6587\u5b50. A few historical allusions show that it is false, and a later fabrication. The work mentioned in the Han Catalogue cannot be the same. [exvii, 6.]\n\n(40).\u2014\u516c\u5b6b\u9f8d\u5b50. Mentioned in the Han, but not in the Sui Catalogue. The modern edition is a later production. [exvii, 10.]\n\n(41).\u2014\u5546\u5b50. Mentioned in the Han Catalogue, but the modern edition is by later hands. [ci, 6.]\n\n(42).\u2014\u845b\u51a0\u5b50. Mentioned as a Taoist work in the Han Catalogue, but the modern edition is shallow and commonplace. [exvii, 9.]\n\n(43).\u2014\u614e\u5b50 is described as being of different sizes in the various catalogues, and the present editions differ from them all. [exvii, 7.]\n\n(44).\u2014\u65bc\u9675\u5b50. Produced by a Ming scholar. [exxiv, 1.]\n\n(45).\u2014\u5b54\u53e2\u5b50. Mentioned neither in the Han, Sui nor T'ang Catalogue, but first in the Sung. The work contains historical statements which are wrong. It is probably a compilation by its Sung publisher. [xci, 7.]\n(46).\u2014\u6587\u4e2d\u5b50. It is doubtful whether such a person ever lived. The work is probably a production of its Sung publisher.\n\n(47).\u2014\u516d\u97ec. First mentioned in the Sui Catalogue. The work shows a misunderstanding of the meaning of \u9690\u7b26, which is ridiculous. [xcix, 3.]\n\n(48).\u2014\u53f8\u99ac\u6cd5. According to the Han Catalogue, it consists of 155 parts, in the Sui Catalogue only three are mentioned, and the modern edition has scarcely five, which proves that the original was lost long ago, and the present is a later compilation. [xcix, 6.]\n\n(49).\u2014\u5433\u5b50. The Han Catalogue mentions 48 parts. The modern work in six parts is an imposture. [xcix, 5.]\n\n(50).\u2014\u9ec3\u77f3\u516c\u4e09\u7565. First mentioned in the Sui Catalogue, without name of author, except that it was written by a half-god, which is ridiculous. [xcix, 8.]\n\n(51).\u2014\u5c09\u7e5a\u5b50. Two works are mentioned in the Han Catalogue, with which the modern edition does not agree. The contents prove it to be an imposture. It should be destroyed. [xcix, 7.]\n\n(52).\u2014\u674e\u885b\u516c\u554f\u5c0d. On military art. There was no complete work in existence, but only an outline in the \u901a\u5178, from which a Sung author concocted this edition. [xcix, 12.]\n\n(53).\u2014\u7d20\u66f8. Falsely attributed to Hwang Shih-kung (s. 50), but really the work of its publisher and commentator, Sung dynasty. [xcix, 10.]\n\n(54).\u2014\u5fc3\u66f8. Falsely ascribed to Koh Liang. [c, 5.]\n\n(55).\u2014\u98a8\u540e\u63e1\u5947\u7d93. A work of modern times.\n\n(56).\u2014\u5468\u9ac0\u7b97\u7d93. First mentioned in the Sui Catalogue. The first two characters of its title are not intelligible. It is folly to refer it to Chow Kung. [cvii, 2.]\n\n(57).\u2014\u77f3\u7533\u661f\u7d93. The modern edition is an imposture. [cvii, 34.]\n(58).\u2014\u7e8c\u66f8\u7d93. Ascribed to Kwoh Poh. It is a vulgar forgery. [cix, 1.]\n\n(59).\u2014\u6492\u6c99\u7d93. A forgery, though said to be a work from the Tang dynasty.\n\n(60).\u2014\u9ec3\u5e1d\u7d20\u554f. First mentioned in the Sui Catalogue. It is a product from the time after the Han. [ciii, 1.]\n\n(61).\u2014\u91ab\u6a1e\u7d93. Belongs to the same period as No. 60. [ciii, 3.]\n\n(62).\u2014\u795e\u8fb2\u672c\u8349. Not mentioned in the Han Catalogue. The name \u672c\u8349 first occurs in the history of Ping-ti of the Han. The work is a production of the Eastern Han; later generations added to it. [civ, 36.]\n\n(63).\u2014\u79e6\u8d8a\u4eba\u96e3\u7d93. First mentioned in the Sui Catalogue, and afterwards in the Tang Catalogue. Nothing more can be found out. [ciii, 4.]\n\n(64).\u2014\u8108\u8a23. Ascribed to a writer of the Tsin, but it is a later imposture, probably from the five dynasties. [civ, 18.]\n\n(65).\u2014\u795e\u7570\u7d93 [cxlii, 4.] and\n\n(66).\u2014\u5341\u6d32\u8a18. Both works, ascribed to a Han scholar, are forgeries. [cxlii, 6.]\n\n(67).\u2014\u5217\u4ed9\u50b3. Ascribed to Liu Hiang, but not mentioned in the Han Catalogue, where the works of this author are enumerated; the style also differs. [cxixi, 32.]\n\n(68).\u2014\u6d1e\u51a5\u8a18 is an imposture from the time of the six dynasties. [cxlii, 10.]\n\n(69).\u2014\u535a\u7269\u5fd7. Ascribed to a scholar belonging to the Wei and Tsin dynasties, who is said to have read 30 cart-loads of books, and produced a work in 400 books, which he afterwards reduced to 10. This is incredible. The work is a forgery by the commentator, who lived during the Tang dynasty. [cxlii, 39.]\n\n(70).\u2014\u675c\u5f8b\u865e\u8a3b. This is also falsely ascribed to another author.\nD.\u2014Authentic Works wherewith False Portions are intermingled.*\n\n(71).\u2014\u4e09\u79ae\u8003\u8a3b. Contains many later additions. [By \u5433\u6f84 of the Yuen dynasty.] [xxv. 1.]\n\n(72).\u2014\u6587\u5b50. A pupil of Lao Tsz, contemporary of Confucius, may be doubted. The book is in the style of Lao Tsz, but contains also much taken from Mencius and other sources. It has, however, a genuine kernel in it. [cxlvi, 28.]\n\n(73).\u2014\u838a\u5b50, especially four chapters, are found objectionable. [cxlvi, 21 ff. and cxlvii, 7 ff.]\n\n(74).\u2014\u5217\u5b50. Said to be forged out of Chuang Tsz with later additions. [cxlvi, 18 ff. and cxlvii, 6 ff.]\n\n(75).\u2014\u7ba1\u5b50. It is not the work of one man's pen.\n\n[cxi, 1 and 13 ff.]\n\n(76).\u2014\u8ce2\u8abc\u65b0\u66f8. The author's name is famous among the Han scholars. The name of this book appears first in the Sui Catalogue. The [present] work is certainly not the original work of Yi. [xcii, 11.]\n\n(77).\u2014\u50b7\u5bd2\u8ad6. A medical work by a Han scholar, but so confused that it is difficult to get a clear idea out of it.\n\n(78).\u2014\u91d1\u5331\u7389\u51fd\u7d93. Ascribed to the author of No. 77, but it is an imposture by a later person.\n\n(79).\u2014\u723e\u96c5. Neither the Han nor the Sui Catalogue mentions its author. In the T'ang dynasty it is first ascribed to Chow Kung, which is wrong. The book was composed after Li Son (\u96e2\u9a37), to which elegy it alludes. It may belong to the Han time. It serves to explain the Classics, but cannot be classed among their number. [xli, 5.]\n\n(80).\u2014\u97fb\u66f8.

[cxviii, 26.]\nThe Chinese volume from which this list is taken bears no date, but it cannot be less than 200 years old. Since that time antiquarian research has been going on among the Chinese with much ardour. But the results of their critical labours have not yet been collected into one work like Yao's. The Imperial Catalogue, mentioned already, was completed in the year 1782, more than 100 years ago. As it exhibits very fair judgment, we regret that it is not brought up to date. The large collection of works on the Classics, called \u7687\u6e05\u7d93\u89e3, in 360 volumes, and a supplement to it of about the same size, embody much of the latest researches on the 13 classical books, including the different readings of the text. Of other ancient works only such are taken into consideration as have a direct bearing on the Classics. A great deal of valuable criticism is still scattered through writings published privately, or in collections of miscellaneous writings, which are commonly expensive and sometimes difficult to obtain. I feel sure that the critical tendency among many highly accomplished native scholars is due to Western influence on the Chinese mind. On the other hand, an unscholarly dependence on the writings of the earlier Jesuits, with a corresponding neglect of recent publications, as also absence of independent research into the modern literature of China, betray an antiquated state of sinology under which only the conservative views of Chinese authors, mostly of ancient times, are brought forward as the Chinese opinion of the question.\nAPPENDIX (A).\n\n[Quotations from T. WATTERS' Essays.]\n\nA few weeks after the manuscript of my paper on \"Prehistoric China\" had been in the hands of the Council of the C.B.R.A.S. the new work, Essays on the Chinese Language, by T. WATTERS, Shanghai, Presbyterian Mission Press, 1889, appeared. This is a most valuable contribution to Chinese Philology. Its masterly treatment of the subject, the richness of information it gives from original sources, and the rays of light it throws on many difficult questions, will repay a careful study of its contents. Though the scope of the work differs from what is aimed at in \"Prehistoric China,\" though our methods vary and our results may appear as not of the same nature, or as belonging to different departments, still there are many points where we touch one another. The student will, therefore, probably welcome a few extracts.\n\n(p. 21) \"But it is to be noted that the passages in the 'Shu-ching' just referred to\" [on the character for writing, \u8a00] \"have been condemned as spurious by some critics, and there is some doubt as to their genuineness.\" (p. 22) Among the official class, writing seems to have been in common use under the early rulers of the Chou dynasty. (p. 23) In this period colleges existed at all official centres, and schools of various kinds were to be found generally throughout the country. Books were written and libraries formed, though, it must be presumed, only on a small scale. The written characters were few and insufficient, much time was wasted in the process of writing, and the materials used were rude and clumsy.\" [Comp. p. 155 of this essay.]\n\n(p. 25, Note). \"Chu Fu-tzu writes to a friend that the 'Urh-ya' was a compilation of the explanations and definitions given by the scholars of former and contemporary times made into a book, but that it has inaccuracies and cannot be regarded as old.\" [See Works rejected No. 79, p. 211.]\n\n(p. 25) \"But Chow's invention had the effect of producing a considerable number of new characters, and of restricting to a small extent the applications of those already existing.\" [Comp. pp. 155 & 149.]\n\n(p. 27) \"It is from this period of Ch'in Shi Huang Ti that the use of the term tzu (\u5b57) or 'character' dates, and the change in name\nfrom w\u00ean (\u6587) or shu (\u66f8) is said to have been brought about by the modes of writing invented by Li Ss\u00fb and Ch'\u00eang Mao. Hitherto, all inscriptions and engravings had been mainly pictorial or symbolic, expressing, as their chief office, only objects or ideas, but now sounds also began to receive attention.\" This puts the beginning of phonetic writing about 600 years later than my estimate of the period of \"Chow's invention.\" I consider the classical period 600-250 B.C. as inconceivable without phonetic writing. [Comp. p. 153.]\n\n(p. 31) \"But the book which has given Yang Hsiung [B.C. 52-A.D. 18] his chief fame in later times is the 'Fang-yen.' [See p. 184 of this.] Native scholars have tried in vain to find out how and why the authorship of this treatise came to be ascribed to him. It is not mentioned in the list of books in the 'Han-shu' nor in the life of Yang Hsiung in that work, nor, so far as is known, does Hs\u00fb Sh\u00ean or any other of Yang's contemporaries refer to the book by name.\" This should be added to the list of rejected works, under E, p. 212.\n\n(p. 33) \"For the making of his 'Shuo-w\u00ean' Hs\u00fb Sh\u00ean studied, with the help of Chia K'uei, one of the greatest of the Han scholars, all the accessible literature in the old characters and in those invented in later times. He compared the texts of the recovered tablets, collected inscriptions on ancient vases, and examined the writings of his predecessors, such as Shi Chow, Li Ss\u00fb, and Yang Hsiung.\" [Comp. pp. 150, 151 of this.]\n\n(p. 37) \"The Buddhist missionaries had come from India and settled down in China . . . They tried to introduce their own alphabet and have it brought into use in China, but in this they completely failed. They succeeded, however, in teaching the Chinese, or at least in giving popularity among them, to an art of spelling, which, though rude and inaccurate, is better than none. This is the procedure known as Fan-chie (\u53cd\u5207).\" [Comp. pp. 156 & 166]\n\n(p. 54) \"In the year 744 an Imperial order was given to have the 'Shu-ching' transcribed in the characters in common use at the time. The Emperor, Ming Huang, disliked the li characters in which the 'Shu' and other classics continued to be written. Moreover, these characters had become obsolete, hard to learn, and liable to confusion, and only professional scholars could read the canonical books . . . The editions of the classics in the vulgar writing soon superseded the others.\" [Comp. the final sentence of Appendix B, p. 218.]\n(p. 57) \"Neither of these two brothers [Hs\u00fc, who re-edited the Shwoh-w\u00ean in the Sung period to form the basis of the modern editions] gave much study to the phonetics of the language, and later scholars object to them that they overlooked the changes which had passed over the sounds of characters between the Han and T'ang dynasties.\" [Comp. p. 151.]\n\n(p. 66) \"Ch\u00eang Ch'iao, 1104-1162, [see p. 158 of this] one of the most erudite and renowned men of letters of the Sung dynasty, distinguished by almost universal knowledge . . . He produced also a book in three chuan 'Shi-ku-w\u00ean' (\u77f3\u9f13\u6587) in which he argued against the supreme antiquity of the 'Stone Drums.' From the resemblance of the characters on these to characters found on objects of the Ch'in dynasty (B.C. 255 to 206) he concluded that the Drums also belong to that period.\" [Journal N.C.B.R.A.S. Vol. viii, p. 134.] [Comp. Appendix B.]\n\n(p. 69) \"Wu\" [\u5433\u68eb, 12th century] \"argued that the political ballads and other poems of early times were at first sung, or chanted, or recited, and that they were not committed to writing but preserved in memory. He held that the minstrels and poets used the sounds current in their several districts at the time, and that words of different tones in the 'Shi' were interchanged and rhymed together.\" [Comp. p. 184]\n\n(p. 100) \"It must be admitted that the investigation of the language is seldom pursued by native scholars as an independent study. It is always an 'inferior science,' and gains importance only as a help to the understanding of the orthodox canonical literature. From the 'Shuo-w\u00ean' down to the latest dictionary, all etymological treatises have been composed with the express design of aiding in the settling of texts, clearing up the meaning, or ascertaining the sounds of characters in the old Confucian writings or in the works composed to teach, illustrate or continue those writings.\" [Comp. pp. 182-187.]\n\n(p. 120) \"Carving in wood seems to have been practised in China from a remote period, and to have been employed for various purposes. In the seventh century B.C. the projecting beams of the roofs of temples and palaces were sometimes elaborately carved and colored. . . . But such rude appliances as knotted cords and carved sticks could not long suffice to meet the requirements of a growing society. The Chinese, accordingly, represent themselves as having at an early period of their history learned to cut, and afterwards paint, in wood...\"\nand stone and metal, figures or outlines of objects. These were practically the first beginning of writing for them. All the earliest characters seem to have been either pictorial representations or rough symbols of natural objects and phenomena. That is, they were either drawings which presented an outline of an object, or drawings which by their composition pointed to the meaning intended.\" [Comp. pp. 192-193.]\n\n(p. 123) \"At first only material objects and their relations, dealings of business, and affairs of government, were depicted in outline or symbol. The chief aim which the inventors and first improvers of the graphic art had in view was to make a record which could be appealed to as evidence. It was in matters of government, according to some native writers, that the use of writing began, the design of the inventors being to facilitate intercourse between the ruler and his servants, and between these and the people, and to register transactions of importance. Thus, when in old times the prince of one state invaded the territory of another, slew the inhabitants, and carried off the booty, he caused the event to be recorded. It was written on bamboo or silk, and engraved in metal and stone to be inscribed on sacrificial vessels for the information of posterity. . . . 'Tadpoles' became the name of a certain whimsical style of written characters.\" [Comp. p. 162.]\n\n(p. 124) \"Dr. Edkins also has stated that 'the phonetic characters appear to belong to the same era as those that are hieroglyphic. They are found together among the earliest remains of Chinese literature. According to the uniform national tradition, they must, therefore, be dated about B.C. 2700.' But this can scarcely be set down as the prevailing opinion among native students of the language. It may be true, however, of written characters, strictly so-called. The earlier transcript of language, which was called w\u00e9n (\u6587), is defined as the visible representation of objects arranged according to categories (or classes). It is also stated that w\u00e9n is the source of object-picturing or delineation.\"\n\n(p. 126) \"One of the marks whereby a barbarian is known is, that he writes from left to right, another being, that he takes his food without using chop-sticks . . . The Buddhist scholars, whether native or foreign, taught moderation and even modesty in the comparison between Chinese and Sanskrit.\"\nAPPENDIX (B).\n\n[The Stone Drums.]\n\n\"On the Stone Drums of the Chou Dynasty,\" an able paper by S. W. BUSHILL, B.Sc., M.D., was read before the Society on November 18th, 1873, and is printed in Vol. VIII. of the Journal. I can here give only a short extract and refer the reader to the article itself.\n\n\"The Stone Drums were discovered in the province of Shensi, lying half-buried in the ground. The earliest accounts of them were written during A.D. 627-649. From intrinsic evidence the inscriptions have been referred by the large majority of authorities to the period of Hsuan Wang (B.C. 827-782). They record a hunting expedition in the writing invented by Chou-shih (Ta-ch'uan). There is, however, no mention of the fact in the historical records of this reign.\n\n\"Under the Sung, the celebrated writer Ou-yang Hsiu was the first to question their authenticity. He says: 'In my collection of ancient inscriptions, there is not one so old as these.' Yet there are three doubtful points which suggest themselves to me. First, their good preservation compared with other inscriptions less old. Second, that they are the only remains of that period beside the Shih and Shu. Third, that no mention is made of them in any early record.\"\n\nThe answers by Chinese authors are not satisfactory, nor is Dr. BUSHILL's summing up: \"If we accept the train of reasoning of Ou-yang we must reject all the sculptured monuments of Egypt, Assyria and Persia which have been brought to light in such profusion of late years.\" As neither the material used in China is the same, nor the climate in the countries referred to, we cannot compare the durability of the monuments here and there. To me the most suspicious feature appears to be that characters of the ancient style should have been so easily decipherable as is the case with all the characters on the Stone Drums.\nAPPENDIX (C).\n\n[Chinese Astronomy.]\n\nDr. Legge's view in the Sacred Books of the East, Vol. III, Oxford, 1879, differs from the opinion he expressed in the Chinese Classics, Vol. III, Hongkong, 1865. The only new argument brought forward is a chart, by Professor C. Pritchard, of the stars as they were visible in China in B.C. 2300. In a pamphlet\u2014Die Schu-King-Finsterniss, von Dr. G. Schlegel und Dr. Franz Kuhnert, Observator der K. K. Gradmessung in Wien,\u2014which was published at Amsterdam in 1889, a new attempt is made to calculate the date of the Eclipse of the Sun mentioned by Legge (Shoo King, I, 167). It will be interesting to take a glance at the history of this astro-sinological experiment.\n\nThe Jesuit Gaubil fixed the date at October 11th, 2154 B.C., in accordance with the Chinese T'ang astronomers and the accepted chronology of the Chinese.\n\nAccording to the Chinese Bamboo-books (see Legge's Chinese Classics, Vol. III), it would be the 28th of October 1948 B.C.\n\nLargeteau found, in the year 1840, that this eclipse occurred during the night, before sunrise, at Ngan-yih (\u5b89\u9091), and was, therefore, not visible. Dr. Chalmers came independently to the same conclusion and adopted the date October 12th, 2127, \"without fear of its being hereafter proved invisible.\" But 15 years later, von Oppolzer proved that this eclipse was not visible at that place in China. The same fate happened to Fr\u00e9ret and Cassini's 24th October 2000, and Joh. v. Gumpach's 22nd October 2155. Theodor von Oppolzer found that of 34 ecliptic conjunctions of sun and moon between 2200 and 1900 B.C., which had occurred in the month of October, only two were visible at that locality in China\u2014those of the 21st October 2136, and 10th October 2135. He decided for the 21st October 2136, provided that the passage in the Shu King could be translated in a different way.\n\nSchlegel and Kuhnert, May 1889, leave the choice between 12th May 1904 B.C., and 7th May 2165, but decide \"with great probability\" for the latter date.\nSchlegel takes the passage in Tso-chuen, Duke Ch'ao, xvii year (Legge, Vol. v, p. 667) as his basis. This passage is taken as a repetition of the statement in the Shu (III, iv, 4), but as the dates do not agree\u2014Legge says: \"The 4th month of Hea was the 6th of Chow. But the present text of the Shoo places the eclipse in the 9th month of the year\"\u2014Schlegel declares the date given in the Shu as an alteration of the original text by the Han revisers, or even by Confucius himself, to make it conform to the position of the sun in their time. The ancient Chinese observation, however, is supposed to have been made at evening in the 2nd month of spring (akronyktischer Aufgang) and in the morning during the 3rd month of spring (kosmischer Untergang), of which no ancient text says a word. Further, I think the limitation of the period to 1900 B.C., according to the Bamboo-books, [Comp. p. 207, Nos. 20-22,] without scientific foundation.\nOBITUARY.\n\nEDWARD COLBORNE BABER.\n\nFrom time to time our Society has to note in the pages of its Journal the loss of one or other of its members. But seldom has it to deplore the disappearance from its roll of so striking an individuality as his, whose death in the wilds of Burmah the newspapers have recently recorded. Had Edward Colborne Baber been a Frenchman, he would long since have worn a red ribbon, perhaps even a rosette, in his button-hole; but he belonged to a nation which is slow to distinguish, and he has gone to his grave with no other mark of distinction than that accorded by the vox populi, viz., that of being spoken of, far and wide, by his simple surname without any addition at beginning or end, which constitutes in itself no doubtful sign of popularity and fame.\n\nIt is just 24 years since Baber joined the British Consular service in China, and the first decade of that period was occupied with the usual duties of a Consular officer in this country. He did not fail, however, to give evidence, on occasions, of that energy and force of character, which have since carried him through many a scene of difficulty and danger. Most of us have heard of his exploit at Nan-chang, when he overawed a dangerous mob, by felling to the ground with a single blow of his fist a ruffian, who thrust an impudent head inside the curtains of his official chair. But Baber's reputation was in the main built up outside the narrow limits of an ordinary Consular career, and it is as an explorer in the untrodden ways of China that he is best known. To him belongs the credit of being one of the few to succeed in investing a Blue Book with a\nreal literary charm; witness that account of his travels in South-western China, published, by arrangement with the Foreign Office, as a special supplement to the Annual Report of the Royal Geographical Society some years ago. In those pages, which, though written for \"presentation to both Houses of Parliament,\" form us fascinating a record of travel as any issued by a Murray or a Macmillan, we can see how his spirit beat against the bars, within which he was confined by the etiquette of the unimaginative official style; and we learn from his own outbursts of regret, how he longed to clothe in a poetical garb worthy of his subject, his descriptions of the glorious mountains of Yunnan. And elsewhere, untrammelled by the requirements of officialism, he was fond of mounting Pegasus and trotting him round for the benefit of his friends. His humorous ballad, \"In Yuen-ming-yuen all gaily arrayed,\" is too well known to be more than referred to.\n\nBaker was attached as interpreter to the Grosvenor Mission, sent into Yunnan in 1876 to investigate the circumstances of the murder of Margary, and to see that justice was done on the guilty parties. He was later stationed for some time at Chungking, which was the starting-point for the explorations he made throughout Szechwan and Yunnan. In one of these journeys he had for companion Captain Gill, whose book of travels, The River of Golden Sand, is well known. In 1879, Baker was appointed Chinese Secretary at Peking, a sedentary post which scarcely suited his restless energies, and which he retained but for a short time. Still nominally attached to the service in China, he was commissioned as Consul successively at Chefoo, Jehang and Swatow, but took up his appointment at none of these places. After a short incumbency of the Consul Generalship in Corea, he quitted China, as we now know, for ever, his services being lent to the Government of India, in connection with the task of delimiting the frontier between Yunnan and Burmah. Though, in earlier days at least, much addicted to all forms of athletic exercise, he was not constitutionally strong, and had a sovereign contempt for the precautions which the average European thinks it necessary to take against the dangers of an Eastern sun. Till further details are to hand, we can only conjecture what the\ncauses were which led to his last illness, whether lack of stamina to resist a sudden attack, or unavoidable exposure to the treacherous climate of Upper Burmah. Whatever the cause may have been, we know he has died at his post and in the midst of his duties. In Edward Colborne Baber our Society has lost one of its most distinguished members; the Government, a zealous and energetic servant; and those who knew him well, a valued friend.\nREVIEW.\n\nAN EXPOUNDER OF DARK SAYINGS.\n\n\"CHUANG TZ\u00dc, Mystic, Moralist and Social Reformer;\" Translated from the Chinese by Herbert A. Giles. H. R. M.'s Consul at Tamsui. London: Bernard Quaritch, 1889.\n\nWe live in days of which the most striking characteristics are an advance by leaps and bounds in all departments of science, and an iconoclasm of creeds as thoroughgoing, in its way, as Luther's revolt from Popery, and much more widespread. Some there are who would connect the two phenomena in a chain of cause and effect, and not without plausible grounds. However that may be, it is certain that the old-fashioned hard-and-fast bounds of most creeds, like to the superannuated defences of many a continental town, have been contentedly dismantled by those within, or have fallen flat before the trumpet blasts of modern thinkers from without. Had these trumpeters been none but godless men of science, as the lovers of the old battlements at one time maintained, the symptoms would not have been so serious as they actually are; but when the higher dignitaries of the Church recruit the ranks of the levelers, and demolish, with a hearty good will, here the six days of the creation, and there the bolts and bars of an everlasting hell, it is no wonder that people in general begin to wake up, and take advantage of their enlarged horizon, to speculate whether there be anything worth knowing beyond the ruined boundaries which hem them in no longer.\n\nThe vast majority of the respective flocks still remain, doubtless, contented and unquestioning within the sheepfolds of Protestantism and Roman Catholicism, but there are an increasing number of truants, who place the honest doubt which leads to enquiry above the cut and dry tenets of any creed, who decline to admit that \"another\nman's doxy\" is necessarily heresy and schism, and who on the whole gain in Charity where they lose in Faith. And it is consoling to know that a good authority appraised the former at a higher value than the latter.\n\nThe spirit of the age is, in brief, a spirit of enquiry into other men's beliefs, with the inevitable result that the enquirer finds there is much commendable, where he would once have been taught to believe all was beyond question condemnable. Audi alteram partem, is the motto of the day. Let us hear what the so-called Turk, Jew, Infidel or Heretic has to say before we decide that he is (almost) past praying for. Fetichism may eventually find partisans, or at least apologists, for aught we can tell; at any rate Buddhism, Mahometanism, Confucianism and Taoism have their admirers, and with respect to all creeds, whether religious or philosophical, there is a general feeling growing up that we ought to understand before we condemn.\n\nThe works of Chnang-tz\u016d, as Mr. Giles is careful to point out, have no title whatever to be classed among the Sacred Books of the East, unless we make a radical change in the ordinary meanings of words. It is also true that Confucianism, which has often been vaguely spoken of as the religion of the educated Chinese, has no claim to rank as a religion. Of Confucius, Mr. Giles writes, (p. ix), \"He taught his countrymen that duty to one's neighbour comprises the whole duty of man. Charitableness of heart, justice, sincerity and fortitude sum up the ethics of Confucius. He knew nothing of a God, of a soul, of an unseen world. And he declared that the unknowable had better remain untouched.\"\n\nThis is an excellent definition of Confucius' doctrines, and to define Agnosticism scarcely a word would have to be changed. Confucianism had never heard of a Supreme Being; Agnosticism has, but decides that God is a possibility without being a necessity. The wavering Christian has a tendency therefore to become practically a Confucianist, his Confucianism being termed Agnosticism because it retains an ineradicable tinge from a past belief. And in like manner the lukewarm Confucianist of the East, tired of what Mr. Giles calls the \"hard and worldly\" doctrines of his prophet,\ndegenerates into the untrammelled far niente follower of Chuang-tz\u016d and Quietism.\n\nEnough has been said to show that the enquirer into the moral systems of the Far East, who should neglect the study of Chuang-tz\u016d, would have needlessly narrowed his field of research. But there are few indeed of such seekers after knowledge, even among the remnant possessed of a fair acquaintance with Chinese, who could crack so hard a nut as Chuang-tz\u016d in the original. An earlier version, from the pen of Mr. Balfour, was, it is true, in the field, but it must be admitted that Mr. Giles has brought to the task masterly powers, a greater practical knowledge of a translator's requirements and a more thorough command of forcible and idiomatic English. It is a difficult, nay, an impossible, task to divest a translation of this length of all the \"parfum de l'antiquit\u00e9,\" and the Eastern flavour which is essential to it; and, even if possible, such a deodorizing process would be undesirable. The smell of the oil is pleasant enough to those, who can appreciate what an arduous work the seven years of toil for his mouth Rachel has been to the author. Whatever gratification Mr. Giles may derive from the completion of his labour of love, I trust he will remember he owes a debt of gratitude to his predecessor. In 1882 he wrote, \"I personally have no reason to be otherwise than grateful to Mr. Balfour for attempting a translation of the Divine Classic. His effort stimulated me to do that which I should in all probability never have done\u2014read the works of Chuang Tsz\u00e9 from beginning to end.\" There may be some who doubt the lasting character of Mr. Giles' gratitude and who yearn with me to see him take in hand some abstruse but interesting author, who has hitherto escaped translation at the hands of a Legge or a Chalmers, a Balfour or a Beale. It is distinctly a matter for congratulation that, having, shortly after its appearance, satisfactorily demolished Mr. Balfour's version in the China Review, Mr. Giles dismisses the offender on this occasion with a Parthian kick at the end of the Introduction, and in a few disdainful lines condescends to\n\n\"let the foolish yeoman go,\"\nWriting chiefly for a class to whom the language of Chuang-tz\u016d is unknown, Mr. Giles has succeeded in laying before them a translation which, while conveying the purport of the original accurately, as far as a cursory inspection has enabled me to judge, is couched in smooth and lucid English, vastly easier of comprehension to the Western reader than the original is to the Chinese. For such as appreciate caviare, the book will have an unalloyed attraction. It cannot be said to be light reading, nor is it a work of such a kind that, when once taken up, you cannot relinquish it till it has been read to the end. On the contrary, even a reader to whom Browning is clear, will often have to lay Chuang-tz\u016d down in order to think a passage over. Many a page will have to be read yet once again before the author's drift is grasped, and there are not a few sentences which will have to be treated as enigmas and given up.\n\nFor instance, we have on page 19 the following words:\u2014\"To take a finger in illustration of a finger not being a finger is not so good as to take something which is not a finger.\" Perhaps Mr. Giles understands what the above means: I confess, I do not. In any case the fault does not lie in the translator, it is an accurate version, I should say, of the Chinese; but if Mr. Giles does understand it, I think he might have enlightened manner mortals in a note, for the import is far from self-evident. Possibly this passage belongs to the third class of renderings referred to on page xiii. In wrestling with the obscurities of his author, Mr. Giles adopted three sensible rules.\u2014\"Where there is a consensus of opinion [among the native commentators], I have followed such interpretation without demur. But where opinions differ, I have not hesitated to accept that translation which seemed to me to be most in harmony with the general tenor of Chuang-tz\u016d's philosophy. And where all commentators fail equally, as they sometimes do, [see for an instance page 329.] to yield anything at all intelligible, I have then ventured to fall back upon what Chuang-tz\u016d himself would have called the 'light of nature,' [for which see page 19.]\"\n\nIt is doubtless by virtue of Rule III that Mr. Giles has been able to present some sort of a version of many a passage which would otherwise have had to be omitted. It would have been useful if such passages had been indicated by an asterisk, placed within\nbrackets, or otherwise distinguished. In a few instances, however, the fact is mentioned in a note. This bold determination to conquer where so many native commentators have failed, is evidence of considerable moral courage and landable self-confidence, and those who know Mr. Giles well, will feel sure that, in the absence of authoritative native decisions, the interpretations of \"Chai Fu Tz\u00fc\" are as good as any procurable from his peers.\n\nI do not propose to enter on a consideration of the contents of the book itself; if any desire to know what Chuang-tz\u00fc has to say, are there not booksellers? But it will not be out of place to offer some remarks on the way in which the work of translation has been done. Mr. Giles has taken a hint from Mr. Ignatius Donnelly, and in so doing has placed his reviewers somewhat at a disadvantage. The author of the \"Great Cryptogram,\" it may be remembered, did not offer a complete elucidation of his alleged discovery. He contented himself with giving a specimen of the results of his calculations, with some of the main features of the system by which these results were arrived at, and then with the calmness of conscious worth\u2014or, the colossal impudence of brazen imposture\u2014invited the public to take the rest on trust. Similarly Mr. Giles announces that this wholly English reproduction of Chuang-tz\u00fc is to be followed shortly by a supplement, consisting of such textual and critical notes as involve the use of Chinese characters in elucidation of his translation. It is obvious that to criticise renderings, while still unprovided with these coining explanations, is to work at a disadvantage. I shall, however, make a few observations of this nature, always promising that I am quite prepared to find Mr. Giles has in reserve arguments which may justify, even in my own eyes, renderings to which I now feel impelled to take exception.\n\nAt the end of his Introduction Mr. Giles states, that \"only one previous attempt has been made to place Chuang-tz\u00fc in the hands of English readers.\" Of the works of Chuang-tz\u00fc, as a whole, this is perfectly true. But portions have found a translator between the appearance of Mr. Balfour's book in 1881 and the present version. It will be instructive to place some of these translations side by side, numbering them 1 (Mr. Balfour), 2 (the other translator) and 3 (the work under review).\n| (a) \"You are as obstinate in your opinion as a man who keeps running round and round in the same circle.\" | \"You might as well try to imprison a man by marking the ground round him.\" | [p. 55] \"Beware, beware, move cautiously on!\" |\n|---|---|---|\n| (b) \"This relief from the anxieties of life and death is as great as that experienced by one who, being strung up by the heels, is suddenly cut down.\" | \"A man suspended in the air may cut down another suspended man, but not himself.\" | [p. 81] \"I am simply hanging in the air, unable to cut myself down.\" |\n| (c) \"When a corner is hacked (with a knife) it requires afterwards to be carved and worked.\" | \"Guard them (men's hearts) from all external injuries,\" | [p. 123] \"But try to cut and polish it.\" |\n| (d) \"In the beginning of all things, there was not even nothing. There were no names, these began afterwards.\" | \"At the beginning of all things there was nothing; but this nothing had no name.\" | [p. 143] \"At the beginning of the beginning, even nothing did not exist. Then came the period of the nameless.\" |\n| (e) \"Though a loud noise may be unheard by those who are close by.\" | \"A great truth cannot penetrate rustic ears.\" | [p. 154] \"Grand music does not appeal to vulgar ears.\" |\n| (f) The perfect man, though he walks in obscurity, meets with no obstructions.\" | \"The perfect man can walk under water without difficulty.\" | [p. 231] \"The perfect man can walk through solid bodies without obstruction.\" |\n| (g) \"I never meet with favourable times in my capacity of ruler.\" | \"I do not serve my prince as the times require.\" | [p. 243] \"Officially, I am not a success.\" |\n| (h) \"Things which come together fortuitously\u2014without any special cause or raison d'\u00eatre,\u2014afterwards part company in an equally fortuitous manner.\" | \"The former (the superior man) having had no motive in contracting the intimacy, will have no object in breaking it off.\" | [p. 254] \"The friendship of the mean man begins without due cause, and in like manner comes to an end.\" |\n(i) He looked southwards [to the abode of Lao Tsze] and was displeased.\n\n\"He became king but did not leave off [teaching].\"\n\n(j) \"Saying, 'O ye, O ye who are above the first to incur the great troubles that there are upon the earth, are you not robbers, are you not murderers!'\" \"[To this Lao-tz\u016d replied, 'My son, my son, are you then going to be the first to rid us of the great curses of the world with your 'Do not steal,' and 'Do no murder'?'\"\n\n[p. 294] \"On hearing of this, K'eng Sang Ch'un turned his face to the south [towards the abode of Lao Tz\u016d] in shame.\"\n\n[p. 314] \"'O Sirs, O Sirs, there was trouble upon earth, and you were the first to fall into it.'\n\n'I would say, Perhaps you were robbers, or perhaps murderers!'\"\n\nIn the case of some of these passages, it is almost incredible that meanings so utterly diverse should be extractable from them. And it is, if possible, still more incredible that any one considering the renderings of, for instance, the sentence marked (c) in the 2nd and 3rd columns, should be able to maintain that the Chinese language is never ambiguous. Yet these two renderings are from the same hand, for translator No. 2 is no other than Mr. Giles himself, as may be seen in the China Review for July 1882. And who, in the face of Mr. Giles' new rendering of passages (d) (i) and (j) can doubt that Mr. Balfour will be able to gather some crumbs of consolation for the stripes of 1882 from the pages of Mr. Giles' Chuang-tz\u016d of 1889?\n\nIt would be eminently unfair to deduce from the above passages that Mr. Giles seven years ago had only an elementary knowledge of the Chinese language. Not only unfair but grossly illogical, for to draw a universal conclusion from premises of which one at least is particular, is a fallacy such as would make him of Stagira turn in his grave. Yet it is sometimes done. The just conclusion to draw is that in 1882 Mr. Giles had given Chuang-tz\u016d only a hasty consideration, and has seen reason to modify his opinions since.\n\nIn striving to put Chuang-tz\u016d before the English reader in as easily intelligible a form as possible, and perhaps in some instances\nfrom a wish to be graphic or to turn a sentence neatly, Mr. Giles has ended by being at times misleading. What I would chiefly complain of is the rendering by one English word of divers Chinese expressions, which while perhaps reducible to one general category, are still of many distinct shades of meaning. It is a translator's pecadillo which Mr. Giles shares with the authors of the Authorised Version of the Bible, so he errs in good company; but as this very fact formed one of the strongest arguments in favour of a revision, it is a pity it was not avoided here. The most glaring instance is of course the word \"God,\" which some sinologists would say does not occur once in Chuang-tz\u016d, but which nevertheless will be found liberally sprinkled throughout these pages. Waiving the objection which might be made that the Chinese can hardly be said to have a word for \"God\" (with a capital letter) at all, it would have been open to Mr. Giles to select any one character which he thought would bear the rendering, and to have restricted the use of the English word to passages where that character occurred. But take the following sentences:\n\n1. \"I played us a man, drawing inspiration from God.\" [p. 177.]\n2. \"Its name is then of God.\" [p. 194.]\n3. \"Were I to prevail upon God to allow your body to be born again.\" [p. 225.]\n4. \"It is the delegated image of God.\" [p. 282.]\n5. \"God will punish them.\" [p. 302.]\n\nThe unwary reader would take it for granted, and justifiably so, that \"God\" in each case represents the same idea in Chinese. But so far is this from being the case, that in each of the five the idea is different. In (1) it is Tien, Heaven; in (2) Ti, a ruler or Emperor; in (3) Ssu Ming, the Controller of Destiny; in (4) Tien Ti, Heaven and Earth; and in (5) Kuei, a devil, or, as translated on p. 236, a bogey. Only in this last instance does Mr. Giles explain in a note this somewhat startling specimen of catachresis.\n\nThis wholesale reduction of many terms into one occasionally lands Mr. Giles in a difficulty. For instance on page 41 there is a\npassage, \"He who is inwardly straight is a servant of God. And he who is a servant of God knows that the Son of Heaven [the Emperor] and himself are equally the children of God.\"\n\nHere each of the words italicized represents the Tien of the original; so that we have the anomaly of the same character translated in two different ways in as many lines. What Mr. Giles' dilemma was is of course obvious enough, but if he had elected to translate Tien in the usual way the dilemma would not have presented itself, and the result would have been rather clearer and more nearly what Chuang-tz\u016d meant to express.\n\nAnother case of misleading (here, I fancy, with the idea of being more graphic,) occurs on page 46:\u2014\"It will be as though you took fire to quell fire, water to quell water, which is popularly known as 'pouring oil on the flames.'\" The enthusiastic proverb-hunter might well be excused for thinking he had run to earth in Chuang-tz\u016d an excellent equivalent for a Western saying. But on turning to the Chinese he would find nothing about oil, nothing about flames, and not even the word \"pouring.\" The Chinese is simply \"making matters worse\" or, more literally, \"aggravating\" [the difficulty or, situation]. Mr. Giles would have been quite justified in inserting in a note that in Europe we should speak of \"pouring oil on the flames,\" but he ought to have kept it out of the text.\n\nOn p. 135 we read \"Sovereignty begins in virtue and ends in God\" (i.e., Heaven). I should say it is doubtful whether the character ch'\u00eang, here translated \"ends,\" will bear that interpretation. \"Is perfected\" appears nearer the mark. But this is a case in which the promised supplement may enlighten us. Supposing, however, that \"ends\" is tenable, I wonder Mr. Giles resisted the temptation of giving the dictum a prophetic turn. Translated, as it well might be, thus, \"Sovereignty originated in pre-eminence and ended in divine right,\" it would have been startlingly applicable to the history of monarchical institutions.\n\nWe must look to the supplement, I presume, to reconcile the translation of a sentence on p. 137 with the original. The former reads, \"He will not account a throne as his own private gain,\" but the Chinese, at least in the text I have followed, has no\nmention of a throne, but has instead \"the profits of a generation.\"\n\nBut with a wholesome fear of this ingeniously mimatory supplement, which may reduce me to confusion when it appears before my eyes, I refrain from further textual criticism, and will close this notice with a hearty commendation of Mr. Giles' Chuang-tz\u016d to the attention of the reading public, by way of valediction.\n\nG. M. H. PLAYFAIR.\nPROCEEDINGS.\n\nMinutes of a General Meeting held at the Society's Library on Saturday, 14th December 1889, at 9 p.m.\n\nThe chair was taken by Mr. P. J. Hughes (the President). About 40 persons were present.\n\nThe Chairman, in opening the proceedings, said that the lecture which Dr. Macgowan had kindly undertaken to give that evening, was one which could not be otherwise than instructive and interesting, as it referred to a subject which had at least the charm of novelty to the general public. It was true that \"Gynaeocracy,\" or \"Gynarchy,\" as he should prefer to call it, was probably known to some of them under a more familiar title as applied to a system of Government in the domestic circle. It was understood, however, that the lecturer did not propose to treat the subject as a social question of the present day, but as a political and historical question of the past. It was unnecessary to go through the form of introducing Dr. Macgowan to a Shanghai audience. As the Nestor of sinologues, he was known to most of them and respected by all; and his many valuable contributions to their knowledge of China and the Chinese had made his name familiar as a household word. He was sorry that the unavoidably short notice which had been given and the severity of the weather had prevented the attendance of many who would otherwise have been present; but among the numerous and representative audience there assembled, the lecturer would be glad to recognise some of his old friends and fellow-labourers in the field of Chinese literature; and he (the Chairman) had no doubt that Dr. Macgowan would receive the attentive and appreciative hearing which he well deserved.\nDr. Macgowan, proceeding to read extracts from his paper on \"The Gynaeocracies of Eastern Asia,\" remarked that the unmellifluous word shortened by Sir Walter Scott into gynocracy meant simply what in domestic matters all right-minded men enjoyed\u2014the sway of woman. On the present occasion it referred to political domination, yet it was not to be regarded as bearing on the question of the enfranchisement of women, but as a contribution to anthropological sociology, though perchance something might be found which could be made to fortify the views of advocates and opponents of that momentous question. He added to these prefatory remarks that he eschewed the use of the term \"female\" as not sufficiently respectful to the dependent sex\u2014to whom the fittest, the reverential, sacred term \"woman\" or \"lady\" should be applied.\n\nEthnographical observations commenced the discourse, to show the conditions of aboriginal peoples whom the Chinese found on the Yellow River on their arrival from Akkad. The Chinese then possessed the rudiments of civilisation, of which the aboriginals were destitute. That this irruption of the Chinese was anterior to the invention of cuneiform writing in Akkad was probable, because of their use of quipos or knotted cords in keeping records. Dr. Macgowan added parenthetically that on a future occasion he would explain his views respecting quipos, as they, and not mere tradition, were the base of Chinese archaic annals, and that from those quipos the earliest form of Chinese written characters was evolved. Anterior to these quipos, judging from certain neighbouring tribes, notched sticks were employed, which was an improvement over a plan by which certain Mongol Sachems kept account of the number of their soldiers and cattle. Into a hole in the floor of the tent sheep droppings were deposited, a pellet being dropped in or subtracted on every addition or loss of man or animal; by counting the store of pellets, the strength of the army or number of horses could be known. With regard to the tribes which the Chinese found existing on reaching their future home, Dr. Macgowan remarked that the philosopher of Universal Love\u2014Motzn, proto-altruist and arch-heresiarch\u2014whose sun was rising when the sun of Confucius was setting, enunciated views on the evolution of the State and Family which are in accord\nwith those of modern anthropologists. Men at first were in the lowest state of savagery: there was no Golden Age as depicted by sages and political philosophers until men felt the necessity of a remedy for the anarchy that prevailed. Practices of self-deformation were, some of them, remarkably curious, such as those of drinking through the nostrils, extracting of front teeth and substituting dogs' teeth, head-flattening, etc.; the most striking was the attempt to raise a polydactylons race, by destroying all children who came into the world with the usual number of fingers and toes, and thus the tribe had a dozen fingers and as many toes. Self-deformation might be taken as a differentiation between man and brute; not even the anthropoid ape disfigured his visage to improve his beauty; he did not tattoo himself, nor did his mate resort to tight-lacing. Man alone was given to such conceits. The first Queendom described was that which was established in Tongking at the beginning of the Christian era, the occasion being an attempt to throw off the Chinese yoke. In relation to the suppression of that rebellion, Dr. Macgowan remarked that the Chinese army would have extended its conquests in the South until the Dragon could have in the Straits of Malacca, but for malaria, which in a single year destroyed half their number. But for that fell foe Chinese conquests would have annexed the entire Malayan archipelago long ago, and Canton would have become a northern port of China. Jungle-fever alone prevented Burma becoming a Chinese province in the latter half of the last century. The most remarkable gynocracy was established on the South of the Karakorum Pass in Kashmir by a tribe of Chiang, who in the third century B.C. were driven from Eastern Turkestan. The sufferings of their flight across the Gobi desert and ascent of the Karakorum Pass must have caused them to reach their destination with very few surviving women, and polyandry was the result, and the system of plurality of husbands led to the establishment of hearth rule. Women were few and became dominant. In the course of their history the Karakorum Chiang, wearied by civil wars consequent on contested claims to succession to the sovereignty, resolved to vest the chieftaincy in a line of women, and applied to a dominant clan for two maidens to be their queen and vice-queen, which was\naccorded, and when these died without female issue application was again made for a brace of girls as successors, a large amount of gold being sent as a present to the clan which enjoyed the hereditary right of keeping up the line of women sovereigns. Her majesty the queen of the Karakorum Chiang held a levee every five days in a nine-storied palace. No male held office except in the army, which was under the command of a generalissimo. Attempts at display were made at this court, the most striking feature being the horns which adorned the head-gear of the ladies, each sporting gold horns indicating the number of husbands possessed. Among a tribe of barbarians in the south tufts of hair indicated the number of husbands which the dames possessed. Comparing this court with the contemporary court of Heraclitus it is probable that while the barbaric display of the former would jar on the aesthetic sense as compared with the magnificence of the court on the Thracian Bosporus, yet the decorum of the simple pagans placed them on a plane higher than that of the licentious Christian court. How long this polity existed it was impossible to discover; probably more than a century, possibly several centuries. It was not likely that of their own accord the Chiangs abolished woman rule: it probably existed until the State was subjugated by more powerful neighbours. Their constitution was the ideal of a commonwealth\u2014rule with the consent of the governed; it did not appear that they became dissatisfied with their peculiar institution, seemingly they were content with the gentle, suave, benign and not unwise sway of mothers, wives and sisters. The whirligig of time had brought the descendants of the founders of this gynocracy under woman's sway; the Empress of India now ruled in that region and with the free consent of the governed. It was noteworthy that the men of this queendom, where women were excluded from every office except chieftainship, were less advanced in civilisation, less martial, less virile than those who committed the entire administration of the country to their wives. Whether their higher civilisation was due to that cause, or whether their greater progress induced them to adopt the polity, cannot be ascertained. Usurpation by a son of a queen led to the abolition of woman's dominion in the country, which became absorbed by China, when its\npolyandry was gradually changed to less discivilising polygamy; and when their land became denationalised, each cultivator becoming owner of the soil he cultivated, they entered on a march of improvement, as did the Chinese when at the revolution (Chinn's sole revolution, the only interruption in the continuity of her evolution), to which cause, with eligibility of every man to office, is due the progress that she has made. Erstwhile husbandmen enjoyed their land in usufruct only, during which period China was stagnant, or engaged in internecine strife. The lecturer went on to give notices of Malaynn, Papuan, Siamese, Japanese and Corean gynocracies, concluding with those of China, empresses and female regents. It was not until the approach of the revolution that cases occurred\u2014these cases were already known to history, and might here stand over, with the remark that fears of usurpations of empresses dowager acting as regentesses led sometimes (under the Northern W\u00ean in imitation of Hung W\u00ean) to the murder of mothers of heirs apparent, a practice restricted to an alien dynasty and strongly denounced by Chinese writers. It was chiefly among the aboriginal inhabitants that women chieftaincy obtained to this day. There was seldom an age in which one tribe or another did not afford examples\u2014the more primitive the condition of these tribes the slighter was sexual differentiation as regards public governmental affairs, both civil and military. It was rumours respecting tribes of this kind which gave rise to fables and myths in Greece regarding Indo-Seythian Amazons. To the list of women rulers of China, which included empresses of execrable character as well as of character the most exemplary, must be added that of the illustrious lady who has just retired from a regency which must give her a conspicuous niche among the best rulers of her sex. A few remarks were added respecting the court of Rock-tiger, who for a few years held portions of Shensi and Shansi under his sway, shortly before the establishment of the Northern Wei. His Majesty Rock-tiger had a body of maidens numbering ten thousand, duly co-ordinated into seven ranks. To the cleverest was assigned the duty of superintending the astrological observatory\u2014to check the predictions of the male Bureau. More interesting was his cavalry, a thousand strapping girls wearing jaunty, crimson caps, on steeds gaily caparisoned, as a body-guard.\nDr. Enkyns said that they had presented to them a very interesting subject treated in a very interesting manner. It is well for the progress of ethnology to draw on the literatures of Asiatic countries for fresh facts. In the books of ethnologists of the present age, published in Europe and America, attention was devoted too exclusively to the modern savage as he was found in islands scattered about the ocean, but they could only arrive at safe conclusions in ethnology by joining the old facts collected in national literatures with the newly-gathered stories of modern travellers. This contribution of Dr. Macgowan's to their Journal would be welcomed by the ethnological and anthropological societies of the West. Prof. Huxley had divided races into three\u2014the black, the tawny, and the white. He laid down a line from Lapland to the Malayan archipelago, and placed the Turanian or yellow races to the north and east of this line. Perhaps proximity to that line had something to do with the appearance of Amazons in history. In Homer they occupied a prominent place. Gyneocracies had played a great part near that line, apparently from the union of race characteristics of opposite kinds, and quite as much from their clashing and rivalry. In regard to the origin of female rule, it was, he thought, the consequence of regency, and the hereditary principle in Governments was the principle on which it rested. In China for a quarter of a century resilient foreigners had had the opportunity of judging of the success or failure of rule by a woman. The opinion was unanimous that the country had been wisely ruled. The fact was that woman was naturally possessed of those faculties which, improved by education, have led to its being frequently recognised in times ancient and modern that the government of a State was safe in her hands.\n\nDr. Bock and Dr. Focke added a few words, and a hearty vote of thanks was accorded to the lecturer.\n\nThe meeting terminated with a vote of thanks to the Chairman.\nMinutes of a General Meeting held at the Society's Library, on Friday, 20th December 1889, at 9 p.m.\n\nThe chair was taken by Mr. P. J. Hughes (the President). There were about 50 persons present.\n\nIn opening the meeting the Chairman mentioned that as the proceedings of the last meeting of the Society, which was held on the 14th instant, had been reported in the local press, he would, with the permission of the meeting, dispense with the formality of reading the minutes. There were, however, a few matters not mentioned at the last meeting which it was desirable to notice. He was informed by the Honorary Secretary that the replies to the questions circulated by the Society early in the year on \"Currency and Measures\" had come in neither as readily nor as fully as was expected. Mr. Morse, who had kindly undertaken the duty of editing the replies, reported that the abstract of the papers which he was preparing would \"be useful only to circulate for amendment and amplification.\" When the abstract was complete, it was proposed to print and circulate it, in order that the information might be checked and supplemented. It was hoped that all interested in the subject\u2014and it was one which should be specially interesting to all engaged in commerce\u2014would aid in making the information as full and precise as possible. He might add that at a late meeting of the Council it was suggested that the subject for a similar series of questions to be put in circulation next year should be \"The Roads and General Means of Communication and Travel throughout China.\" With a view of obtaining information on this important subject, a list of questions was in course of preparation. When referring at the last Meeting to the forthcoming papers intended to be read or published, he should have mentioned that they had in the press a valuable paper by Mr. von Mollendorff on \"Manchu Literature.\" It was also his duty to announce that since the Annual General Meeting of the 28th May the following gentlemen had been elected members of the Society:\u2014The Rev. E. T. Williams and Dr. R. C. Beebe, of Nanking; Messrs. A. D. Startseff and G. Martinoff, of Tientsin; Messrs. Chesney Duncan and T. E. Hallifax, of Corea:\nMessrs. Claude A. Rees and Otto Messing, of Shanghai. He now begged to invite Dr. Faber to favour them with some account of his paper on \"Prehistoric China as revealed by the Chinese Written Character.\" The paper in its original form had been accepted for publication by the Council and would appear in the Society's Transactions at an early date.\n\nDr. E. Faber then read extracts from his paper on \"Prehistoric China as revealed by the Chinese Written Character,\" which is printed in extenso on pp. 141 seq. of this volume.\n\nDr. J. Edkins said that the exposition by Dr. Faber of the formation of the Chinese characters was most interesting and would prove useful, it was to be hoped, in alluring to the study of the Chinese writings a larger circle of students. In regard to Dr. Faber's chronology he thought it very far in the wrong. By assuming the age of Chinese writing to be no earlier than about 800 years before Christ, Dr. Faber placed himself in opposition to Confucius, to Mencius, to the Han dynasty scholars, to the classical school of the T'ang dynasty, to the Sung dynasty critical school, and to the scholars of the present dynasty, who had carried research much farther than it had been carried before and in a perfectly independent manner. Dr. Faber was prepared to treat the classics as legend, and in doing so he was going against much valuable evidence. For example, there was the astronomical proof of the genuineness of the first parts of the Shu King. The Pleiades were now at the winter solstice about 145 degrees distant from the sun. But in the Shu King the Pleiades were only 90 degrees from the sun at the winter solstice. The precession of the equinoxes was nearly a minute a year. Taking it at fifty seconds, in 71 years the place of the Pleiades had moved a degree; hence the observation in the Shu King must have been made about 2,108 years before Christ. Anyone could make the addition of 50 seconds a year, and he would find it so. In this case we found astronomy in accord with Chinese chronology, and we had better, then, accept the statement of scholars in regard to the books in which this and three other similar observations of stars were found. Not that the book was entire or uninjured. It consisted of fragments, and in it there were many gaps. But\nthose of an astronomical kind showed that its earlier portions deserved their confidence. With this view the contents of the book agreed. The Emperor Yan gave his three daughters as wives to one husband, the Emperor Shun. Such a thing could not have happened in the China of the Chow dynasty or at any later period. The book that contained it must therefore be much more ancient. So with the geographical chapter, the Y\u00fc Kung. Dr. Faber said it was written in the Chow dynasty. But against this view was the fact that it had no Chow dynasty names. Its territorial divisions were the Nine provinces, the Kien chen, names which had given place to others in the times of the Chow. So it might be shown in regard to the Yi King, the book of divination, that the names of five-sixths of its 64 sections were older than the Chow period and that they must have been the accepted names of the divining symbols many centuries before B.C. 1120, the time of Wen Wang. The completion of the system of Chinese writing only about three centuries before the age of Confucius was not capable of being harmonised with the fact that Confucius admired antiquity and studied with great reverence the classics which he edited. If they were such new productions, we should have found proof of it in his writings. So with Mencius. Mencius at the end of his work spoke reverentially of the line of ancient kings and sages ending with Confucius, a hundred years before himself. They were, he says, parted at intervals of 500 years or more. Yan and Shun, Tang and Wen, were his moral and political heroes; and to his knowledge the oldest of these lived more than 1,600 years before his own age. The passage was a splendid ending to a brilliant book and came from one who was a professed expounder of the doctrines of the ancient sages and was personally extremely fond of history. Thus Dr. Faber placed himself in direct opposition not only to Confucius but also to Mencius. Then it should be remembered with what earnestness the scholars of the Han dynasty laboured to restore the ancient classics. Could these able and learned men have been so far mistaken about these books as Dr. Faber's hypothesis implied? It was impossible; and so with the learned classical school of the T'ang dynasty. It was no easy task to overthrow\nthe results of their careful and laborious vigils. Then came the school of the Sung philosophers, followed at due interval by the critical school of the present dynasty. Truly it was a long array of authorities, distinguished for deep scholarship and critical acumen, to whose views and wide knowledge this theory of the late origin of Chinese writing is opposed. The critical school of the present dynasty, beginning with the seventeenth century and still flourishing, was specially worthy of respect. The \"Bell and Vase\" school of research began its career in the Sung dynasty. At present there were about fifty vases in the imperial collection marked in books as of the Shang dynasty; and in the inscriptions on these vases there were many characters which were written phonetically, so that the phonetic principle must have been adopted several centuries before B.C. 1120. Lastly, to account for the orderly development of the language since the first poetry was written, they needed the whole of the extent of the Chinese historical chronology, and could not do with less. A single tone took about a thousand or fifteen hundred years to grow up into accepted use. This natural law would find its scope for action much too cramped and confined within the restricting limits of Dr. Faber's new hypothesis. Recognising the utility of Dr. Faber's analysis of the characters and his study of their construction, his chronology of their origin needed to be firmly rejected, although he had supported his views with so much learning, so much Chinese reading, and so much knowledge of the subject.\n\nDr. Williamson, who said he agreed with Dr. Edkins on the subject of chronology, and who put a number of questions to Dr. Faber on points raised, mentioned that 3,000 years before Christ the Akkads, whose writing had only lately been deciphered, had libraries of two kinds\u2014clay bricks and papyri\u2014and hymns to their gods.\n\nMr. Kingsmill said that were he to differ from the writer of the paper it would not be, as the last speaker, on the score of his having postdated the introduction of writing into China. Rather, he thought, that he had assigned too early a date for the use of the written character as a means of disseminating literature. There was\nevidence, and very strong evidence too, that even so late as the time of Confucius the written characters were not so far developed as to be available for expressing thought and language generally. There was nothing unique in the spectacle of a nation advancing to a high level of civilisation without the possession of a written literature; the case of India, situated nearer to Europe and the West was a case in point. The Rig Veda was on good grounds assigned an antiquity of about fifteen hundred years before Christ, yet it was not till the successors of Alexander opened a path for Western civilisation that writing was introduced into India. The ancient Sanscrit literature was during all that period handed down by oral tradition, and not only the Vedas themselves but, extraordinary to relate, a mass of explanations and comments exceeding in size the original. Again, on the landing of the Spaniards in Central America, they found an advanced civilisation co-existing with an entire absence of writing; quipos did indeed exist and were used for keeping tallies and as remembrancers of the great events of history, but the idea of their representing language had never dawned on the inhabitants of those countries. Mencius, who had been appealed to on the other side and whose authority they would scarcely doubt, was very explicit on the condition of affairs in China. \"When the traces of the royal power of Chow were extinguished, the art of ballad-making was forgotten and annals came into vogue,\" he tells us (IV. 2. XXII). As a matter of fact the period of the destruction of the capital by the Turks (cir. B.C. 770) marks the close of the ballad era. It seems difficult for us, brought up amidst the surroundings of a literature some two thousand five hundred years old, to realise the condition of a people well advanced in civilisation without the aid of letters, yet we have only to look back along the current of our own history to find that but for external circumstances we might have been in similar case. The old ballads sung by the bards at the court of the Welsh princes were the exact analogue of the ballads of the Shi King, and so late as B.C. 541 we find (Shi King XXXI) the King of Wu sending his brother Kichia to the capital of Lu to hear and see their representation, a work of complete supererogation did the ballads, as we are gravely told, exist in writing at the time.\nAgain, in B.C. 529 we find the assistant recorder of Chow praised for his profound knowledge in understanding the three jun, five tien, eight soh and nine k'iu. He, however, fails when he is asked about the K'i shao. \"If he doesn't know this,\" is the remark, \"how should he know anything more distant?\" Even so late as the time of Confucius we find no mention of writing and reading. True, Dr. Legge, by one of those strange instances of mistranslation which are the scandal of sinologues, makes Confucius ask his son, \"Have you read the Odes?\" but the word rendered \"read\" is \"heio\"\u2014to learn by heart. The S\u00fcn Y\u00fc bears internal evidence that it was not composed till long after the time of the sage, probably some three generations, for in Mencius and his contemporaries we find unmistakable allusions to writing and reading, while not a single mention is made of either in the works attributed to Confucius. When, therefore, he tells us Confucius was afraid when he had made the Ch'un-t'sia, we find him using the same word \"make\" which is applied to composing a ballad. What Confucius really did make, and the result of which he feared, is hardly to be considered as what we recognise as the text of what is now called the Ch'un-t'sia, but then were lectures delivered to his disciples, which afterwards, written down in the time of his grandson, became known as the Tso-chwan or \"Assisting Narrative\" erroneously rendered as Tso's narrative, for whose composition a special sage, Tso King-ming, has been invented by the myth-makers. The Ch'un-t'sia itself was doubtless in existence in Confucius' time, but its structure shows that it was at best but a rude description of writing. Even as now printed, with its necessary particles supplied, it contains scarcely one thousand characters; in its original state it must have contained much fewer, and was probably not much advanced beyond the stage of quipos. It was not history, but merely the pegs on which history could be hung, and to enable it to be of any service the court shis handed down orally from one to another the tradition of the events. This was the work of Confucius, and as soon as the art of writing was sufficiently advanced to enable language to be portrayed it resulted in the present Tso-chwan. He had himself paid much attention to the early literature of China with reference to the subject of Dr. Faber's paper; he had taken up the subject with no foregone conclusion, and\nthe result was that he had to discard the genuineness of much of the so-called early literature. Allusion had been made to the *Shu King*, and he must express surprise that Chinese students had been unable to recognise the composite character of the work as handed down. The earlier portions of the *Shu* more especially are of this description, and consist of rude rhymes, generally of four characters, embedded in a crust of later verbiage which is frequently little better than a mass of rubbish. The most trustworthy of the ancient works, the so-called Book of Odes, really the ballads of the Chows, was, he was sorry to notice, but little understood by Chinese students, but a careful study could not fail to correct many of the errors into which they had fallen. Of similar construction to the *Shu* was the *Yih King*, a copy of which he had brought with him. If the cabalistic accretions were removed from the text they would find left behind what were probably meant to represent rude versicles, and some of these he had translated and gave a specimen. The so-called early history of China, as the early history of many of the other nations of antiquity, began in myth and ended in legend. Besides this there was a vast amount of pure invention. They had heard quoted the pretended bases of the Shang dynasty, and his hearers would no doubt be surprised to learn that the 28 so-called Kings of that line were simply an old rendering of the twenty-eight mansions of the lunar zodiac. They would find these constellations appearing in ancient Persian in the Bundahesh, in India in the Surya Siddharta, and in old Chinese in the ordinary received twenty-eight *Shih*. Whence the names preserved in the *Kings* came he was not at the moment prepared to say, but their relations were apparently with the West, and the lists of the sovereigns bore internal evidence of having been evolved in the Han dynasty. It was doubtless comfortable to some minds to receive this mass of verbiage and rubbish as representing an ancient literature, and he envied Drs. Edkins and Williamson the frame of mind which led them to accept it because it was more agreeable to do so than to seek deeper for the truth. Unfortunately, with the writer of the paper, he was unable to bring his mind to this compliant state, and was glad in the interests of scientific truth that Dr. Faber had been bold enough to cast to one side the fetters of an unwholesome tradition.\nDr. Faber warmly thanked all the speakers for their interest in his paper, which had moved them to express their opinions on the subject. He quite agreed with Dr. Edkins that Chinese authors should be treated with respect and that their views should receive careful consideration. Chinese authors, however, were not so unanimous as Dr. Edkins' assertions implied. The principal dates in his lecture were taken from the best Chinese authorities. Neither Confucius nor Mencius, to whose authority appeal had been made, furnished any direct evidence in regard to the age of Chinese writing. Dr. Edkins seemed even to have forgotten the famous saying of Mencius, \"Better no Shu King, than to place entire confidence in it!\" Whether the established Chinese chronology was true or false did not at all affect the line of his argument. Mr. Kingsmill, who had given much careful study to Chinese antiquity, had already satisfactorily answered that point. He might, however, be permitted to remind Dr. Edkins that even on chronology Chinese authors do not agree. There was, for example, a difference of more than 200 years between the respective chronologies of the Sz Ki and of the Han books. W. F. Mayers (Chinese Reader's Manual, p. 366 Note) says:\u2014\"Numerous dissimilar schemes of chronology have been propounded by historical compilers, whose mutually antagonistic views sufficiently attest the unreality of the date for their speculations.\" There were almost no chronological data in the earlier parts of the Shu King. Chronology was still uncertain in the earlier time of the Chow dynasty; not even the chronology of the state of Lu, the native country of Confucius, could be determined beyond the beginning of the \"Spring-Autumn\" Annals, 722 B.C. Sze-ma Kwang, A.D. 1009-1086, got the credit of fixing the standard chronology; but he would call the attention of students to Choo He's account of the matter. He told them:\u2014\"When Kwang first made a chronological scheme, his earliest date was the 1st year of Wei-lee (B.C. 424). Afterwards he extended his dates to the time of Kung and Ho (B.C. 840). After this, again, he made his 'Examination of Antiquity,' beginning with the period of 'highest antiquity,' but he could give no dates of years earlier than the time of Kung and Ho. It was Shaou K'ang-tsie (A.D. 1011-1077) one of the most fantastic\nwriters of the Sung period, who constructed an arithmetical system and used history to paste it up, and who pushed his calculations up to the 1st year of Yao.\" \u2014 (Dr. Legge, III a, page 83, Note.) Thomas Fergusson, in his Chinese Researches, has done a great service to Chinese students by bringing together into one volume the results of all that has been written on Chinese chronology and cycles. After 268 pages of examination of evidence his verdict is: \"The chronology of the Chinese can therefore only be considered as an elaborate fictitious contrivance, to put in narrative and historical order the traditions that have filtered through the outskirts of ancient civilised Central Asia, towards China; where at different periods, onecasts and adventurous military chiefs, and even colonies, have found a dwelling-place, and have brought thither with them the traditions of their former homes, which gradually their descendants have imagined were those of ancestors, who had lived all the time of those traditions in China; and thus they appropriated them for their own glorification and that of their adopted country.\" Mr. Fergusson makes a very important remark on p. 3 of his work:\u2014\"It is partly because the annals of those undoubtedly ancient nations (Egypt, Babylonia, Assyria, etc.,) make no mention of a conveal empire of China, that a reasonable doubt is suggested as to the reality of the chronology on which the antiquity of that empire is founded; for had China been in those times the seat of science and civilisation, and of the extent and power which are attributed to it, China would have had such a remarkable prominence in the social world that it could not have been unnoticed or unrecorded. It is this absence of any mention of China from the records of known ancient nations that even justifies a refusal to receive any part of its ancient history except with hesitation, and that also necessitates a most careful investigation as to its truth.\" Dr. Edkins referred to the marriage of Yao's two daughters to Shu as not in accordance with later Confucian morals. If not a myth, this story, however, compared favourably with stories related in the Tso-chuen, about the time of Confucius, and not at all in accordance with the moral standard of the Confucian classics. That geographical names were commonly older than any books which mention them, should not need mentioning.\nDr. Edkins seemed, moreover, to have forgotten that the division of China into nine provinces was ascribed to Ch'en Hui, about 300 years before Yu, the names of which were the same as those of Yu, (Legge, III a 94.) The Emperor Shun, on the other hand, is said to have instituted the division of the empire into 12 provinces, (Legge, p. 38.) As Yu was co-regent with Shun, we find the two divisions of the empire, of which Yu's was regarded as the earlier and Shun's the later, very improbable. [See the chapter on the Chou Li, p. 202.] What the speaker had said as to geographical names applied also to the ancient names of the diagrams of the Yi King. He had no objection to names, only to their writing. Phonetic writing, he maintained, was not older than 1200 B.C., probably 800 B.C. He begged a careful consideration of the statistical table of written characters in the paper. Dr. Edkins' apparently strongest argument was taken from astronomy. \"In the Shu King the Pleiades were only 90 degrees from the sun at the winter solstice.\" Dr. Edkins did not state that the stars mentioned for the summer solstice and those for the two equinoxes could not be seen at the time in China. (Chalmers in Legge III a, Pref. 92.) Dr. Edkins' assertion was in direct opposition to Dr. Chalmers' statement, who says:\u2014 \"No doubt there was a tradition to this effect at the time when the Shu King was compiled, for the author, knowing nothing of the precession of the equinoxes, could not have adjusted them to the time of which he was writing. His 'examination of antiquity' (first sentence of Canon of Yao) was so far accurate, although the details of his narrative may and even must be mythical. Even Yao himself may be so... The value of the astronomical part of the Canon of Yao, as a confirmation of the received chronology, has been much overrated. According to the obvious interpretation of the text, Yao had reason to expect the stars he mentioned to be in the equinoctial and solstitial colures. But what his reason was we are left to conjecture. It might be personal observation; or it might be tradition from his great grandfather, or from Noah himself.\" Thus, if Dr. Edkins wished his assertion to be of any value, he should first have shown that Dr. Chalmers was wrong. Dr. G. Schlegel published in 1875 a large volume of 927 pages and atlas, Uranographie\nThis learned author found Chinese chronology to be far in the wrong, and calculated, from the astronomical data of the *Shu King*, the year in question at 17,827 B.C., or, according to another calculation by the same author, at 16,916 B.C. The difference of 900 years is, of course, trifling in comparison with that of Dr. Edkins' persistently defended chronology, which amounts to about 15,000 years! They might reasonably expect that Dr. Edkins would first settle accounts with other astronomical sinologues before, on such basis, proposing another \"firm rejection\" of a view based on firmer ground.\n\nThe astronomical statements in the *Shu King* were too vague to be of any scientific value. Not a single star was mentioned, but a whole constellation. Dr. Chalmers (Legge, III a, Pref. 95) says:\n\n\"The angular value of the 28 mansions varies from $1^\\circ$ to $30^\\circ$, and modern books differ materially from the older ones as to the dimensions of each.\" Nothing was said as to whether it stood at the horizon or at the culminating point, nothing whether in the evening, at midnight or at dawn. Dr. Edkins simply presumed that the Chinese, 4,000 years ago, were able to determine, to a minute, the culmination of a constellation by mere eyesight, for no instrument was mentioned. Dr. Edkins further presumed that they could determine the exact time of six o'clock. Yao himself thought it better to verify his star-observations by \"the length of the day,\" \"the movements of the people\" and \"the condition of birds and beasts.\" Further, Yao sent his four officers in four directions; according to some commentaries, to the four extreme borders of the then known Chinese provinces. Their reports could then not have reached the emperor until after a period of several months. All these details pointed to traditions outside of China, which were never understood by the Chinese. Dr. Edkins picked out only one fact and fitted that to his purpose. They might be sure that on such ground no scholar would agree with Dr. Edkins and \"firmly reject\" the solid and careful arguments of this paper.\n\nDr. Jamieson said that he had felt it a great privilege when a few minutes before he had received a note from the Honorary Secretary, asking him to propose a vote of thanks to Dr. Faber for the interesting and valuable paper they had just listened to\u2014a paper, he had no\nhesitation in saying, which would prove the most important that had ever appeared in the Transactions of the Society. Those who had once been or were still students of history knew by sad experience that all history voluntarily constructed was liable to be deformed by falsehood; and without any unjustifiable amount of the scepticism which had been denounced by Dr. Edkins, it might be said that no record so formed, no matter how sacred or monumental, was worthy of implicit credence. But here the history, unconsciously inscribed on the language itself, was necessarily and infallibly true. There would needs be differences in the interpretation of it, but whereas, in the case of ordinary history, false interpretations of false records led us into a geometrical progression of error, we had, on the ground which Dr. Faber had broken, only to make sure of our interpretation by careful analysis in order to arrive at certain truth regarding the periods corresponding to the documents. The case was strictly analogous to that of the past history of our globe lithographed on the eternal rocks, where the animals and plants of ages long gone by had left indelible impressions which had only in comparatively recent times found their interpretation. Over these, countless generations of our predecessors had walked all heedless of the treasure beneath their feet. It was a like treasure that Dr. Faber had brought to light, and he (the speaker) was confident that he expressed the feeling of all who had heard Dr. Faber's exposition, when he proposed a hearty and appreciative vote of thanks to the lecturer for doing for Chinese what Max M\u00fcller and other eminent scholars had done for the primitive Aryan language.\n\nThe vote of thanks was carried by acclamation, and the meeting terminated with the usual compliment to the Chairman.\nCHINESE ARCHITECTURE.\n\nBy J. EDKINS, D.D.\n\nTo understand the architecture of a country it is necessary to have some knowledge of antiquity. All architecture rests upon the past and embodies the ideas of the men of earlier generations. If, for example, we approach a Gothic cathedral, we observe it may have on the outside rows of statues sculptured on the front, representing the prophets and apostles of scripture. They are intended to shew that the Christian religion, for the conduct of the worship of which this splendid church was built, was founded on the teaching of the men whose statues we see. If they are in rows, as in Wells Cathedral, there is an idea borrowed from Greek art, which loved to represent battles, religious processions, gymnastic contests, feasts, marriages and court pageants in this way. Entering we pass the font, which reminds us that baptism admits a man to the Christian assembly. The thought then occurs that the door of the building is the gate of admission to the congregation, and that the building is symbolical in all its principal features. In the nave occupied by the assembly of worshippers, the congregation, which is entered by baptism, is symbolized. The aisles may possibly be separately assigned to men and to women, but are the parts of the one church. The mysteries and highest truths of the Christian faith are symbolized by other chief features of Gothic architecture. The whole has an adaptation to impress both the cultivated and the ignorant. Architecture in such a case has an effect of the most striking kind on minds\nendowed with genius. So it was with Milton, whose familiar words I shall be pardoned for using here as a noble introduction to my subject:\n\nBut let my due feet never fail\nTo walk the studious cloysters pale,\nAnd love the high-embowed roof,\nWith antick pillars massy proof,\nAnd storied windows richly dight,\nCasting a dim religious light:\n\nBut the poet wished to describe the effect of music as well as of architecture on the worshipper, and he adds:\n\nThere let the pealing organ blow,\nTo the full-voic'd quire below,\nIn service high, and anthems clear,\nAs may with sweetness, through mine ear,\nDissolve me into ecstasies,\nAnd bring all heaven before mine eyes.\n\nGothic architecture is a medium for religious impression, and its parts are adapted for the conduct of Christian worship. Provision is made for the reader, the preacher, and the musical features of the service. The high arches of cathedrals are not only intended to symbolize celestial aspiration, but also to allow of deep impression being made on the audience by full and reverberating waves of sound.\n\n1.\u2014Classical Chinese Architecture.\n\nIt may be asked, if such be the aim of Gothic architecture and its successful result, what is the aim of Chinese architecture, and is it effective within its own sphere, only having regard to its original ideas?\n\nFirst, I remark that in classical Chinese architecture there is no distinction of an essential kind between sacred and secular buildings. The farther we go back the more clear\ndoes it appear that the palace was a temple and the temple was a palace. This same circumstance in the architecture of the Assyrians struck Layard and other students of Assyrian antiquities. The same fact appears in the old Chinese records. We are told in one of the first chapters of Mencius that Chi Sinen Wang, King of the Chi country, asked him if he should order the Ming tang in his territory to be destroyed, as many persons advised him to do. Mencius said, No; it was the hall for the emperor to announce correct principles of government in the assemblies of the barons. If you wish to act as a king ought, and practise the duties of a wise ruler, do not destroy it. This was his advice. The emperors formerly came, when they visited Tai shan, to hold here a great feudal assembly, to sacrifice to ancestors, to sacrifice to heaven and to reside in it themselves during their stay. This, we partly learn from Panku, who relates that Han wu ti, on visiting Tai shan, found there the foundations only of the Ming tang of the Chen dynasty. The time would be about B.C. 120. The altar and the hall were gone at that time. Chen knng, the great sage, sacrificed to his deceased father, Wen wang, in the Ming tang of the Imperial residence, placing his tablet in a subordinate position at the time of sacrificing to Shang ti. This was to confer the greatest possible honour upon his deceased father. In the Ming tang there was worship offered to the sun and moon, also an altar for burnt sacrifice, in which case the victim was laid on wood and burnt. When the covenant was made between sovereign and feudal barons the emperor sat on a throne nine feet high during the Chen dynasty, three feet high in the Shang dynasty, and one foot high in the Hia. The throne was a dais, and the emperor sat on it cross-legged. The commentator on the Chow-li, from whom I learn these\n\n\\* See \u8003\u5de5\u8a18 K'au kung ki, the supplement to the Chow-li.\nparticulars, adds that when the covenant had been determined on, the fact was announced to the bright spirits, and therefore the hall was called the \"Bright Hall,\" which is the meaning of the name Ming tang. We gather from this, by the way, the true explanation of the common phrase \"Shen ming\"\u2014spirits and bright intelligences. This phrase is much used in modern Chinese for worshipped beings who are believed to come and throng round the spots where sacrifices are offered and prostrations made. They also scrutinize and reward or punish the actions of mankind.\n\n2.\u2014In the construction of the ancient palaces of the Chinese emperors there were three objects kept in view. They were for religious purposes, for feudal audiences and consultations, and they included private apartments for the emperor. The feudal compacts needed to be confirmed by religion. The emperor was chief sacrificer, and there never was in China any notion of local sanctity in buildings. All the reverence attached to a palace is on account of the emperor, the brother of the sun and moon, and his ancestors.\n\nIt became convenient, when the sovereign was at home in his capital, for the worship to be performed at spots removed from the palace, but down to the present time the ancestral hall is still attached to the palace on the south-east. So also the great halls and courts where the emperor meets the princes and high officers are connected with the palace. The altar of the spirits of the grain and land is also as near to the palace on the south-west as the temple of ancestors on the south-east. The arrangement of buildings in the capital at the present time is therefore in principle like the old classical arrangement, which combines the three ideas of temple, hall of audience and private residence.\n\nIn the building of the Imperial capital all favourable circumstances must be combined. There was in ancient times no feng shui. This is a recent superstition. But it was\nrequired to have lucky portents and begin laying out a city upon a lucky day. Chen Kang the sage measured north and south with the gnomon's shadow. The gnomon was eight feet long. The time was noon on the day of the commencement of spring B.C. 1109. He used plummet-line and mason's rule, and the latitude was that of Honan fu, or $34^\\circ 43' 15''$. The mats he used to lay out the palace were six English feet long, and his measuring-rod four feet and two-thirds long. This also is the English foot, the old Chinese foot being taken at eight inches.\n\nThe principal roof of the Ming tang was circular. The building beneath was square at the base. The idea was that of imitating the form of heaven and earth. It had nine rooms and eight windows.\n\nThere were two other chief buildings called Pi yung and Ling tai. The Pi yung was on the east, as it is now in Peking. It contains at present the stone classics, sent by order of the Emperor Chien lung, and the Imperial act performed there is the exposition of the classics before the assembled court. The old Pi yung was devoted to music, archery and the like functions. The Ling tai was employed as a cluster of offices for those officers who were engaged on preparing the calendar and calculating eclipses.\n\nWe find in the Kau kung ki that the dimensions of the Hia dynasty ancestral temple are given. It is there said to have been 14 feet deep and $17\\frac{1}{2}$ feet wide. There were five rooms occupying the north-east, south-east, north-west, south-west and centre; each was fifteen feet square; the middle one was three feet wider from east to west than the others. There were nine steps on the ascent. There were windows as well as doors to each of the five principal rooms. The doors were four and the windows eight. Lime made of shells was used in ornamenting the building. At the main door was a separate hall, said by the Erya, a very ancient authority, to have been a school-room.\nIn this account of a Hia dynasty temple we see that the five elements' philosophy had a voice in the arrangement of rooms. The idea of the architect would be conformity to nature as interpreted by the physical theory of the time. The same occurs in the round hall of the Chow architecture. Roundness means the shape of heaven. The same architecture makes the circle rest upon a square, which is the earth's figure, according to the common idea of the Chinese in ancient and modern times.\n\nIn the Imperial temple of the Shang dynasty the idea of a double roof was introduced. The length of the hall was 56 feet. The emperor's platform was raised three feet. The roof was made double on all four sides. The object in this was to lend an air of greater richness and dignity to Imperial buildings.\n\nIn the Chow dynasty temple the breadth was 54 English feet and the depth forty-two feet. The height of the Imperial dais was six English feet. There were no chairs in those days. They were first used in China in the Buddhist period.\n\nIn the plan of a house the ancients were influenced by filial piety, which caused them to begin with the ancestral hall in the south-east of the plot of land set apart for the building of the palace. This, according to the Chow-li, was the idea of the architecture of B.C. 2200. Religion, as people then understood it, was a powerful sentiment in their minds. So in the First Book of Kings it is recorded first that Solomon built the house of the Lord and afterwards the king's house and the house of the forest of Lebanon.\n\nThe double roof mentioned as an accession of luxurty, when compared with the simplicity of the Hia and ascribed to the Shang dynasty, B.C. 1766, has always continued to be a favorite ornament with the Chinese. It is noticed particularly in gate-towers, pagodas, and towers at the corners of walls. A desire was felt to increase\nthe appearance of gorgeousness in the imperial dwelling, and magnify the difference between the king's house and that of the common people. This effort became greatly intensified in the Chow dynasty. Then the palace assumed the majesty and beauty of the Ming tang. Many separate buildings began to be erected for each function of the king. The servants of the king or emperor (we may call him by either title) had the most multifarious duties to perform, and the offices were multiplied almost beyond belief; so in Peking at the present time the palace buildings and offices of Government are counted by hundreds.\n\nSo far as we have yet gone it will be observed that architecture was at first geometrical. Houses were built to the southward, and they faced north, south, east and west. The circle and the square were both introduced in imperial architecture. The simplest geometrical forms constituted the basis, and ornament was added later. The ancient Chinese built of brick with a wooden framework. The provinces which the nation then occupied are chiefly plains and broad valleys. The chief constituent of the soil is the loess, which is partly a subaerial deposit and has partly become diluvial and alluvial by the action of rivers overflowing every summer. There is also a good deal of yellow clay. Bricks were easily made out of these constituents. The climate was milder than it is now, and the labours of house-building were carried on in the winter. Nothing was found so convenient as brick for house-building, and nothing lends itself more readily to geometrical manipulation.\n\nChinese architecture then had nothing to do at first with the imitation of tent forms. The suggestion has been made that the concave shape of the eaves of Chinese buildings shews that the people love to remember the nomadic life which they once led when they occupied tents of a conical form or shaped\nlike a house-roof. No such concave curve is seen in any old roofs in sculptures hitherto brought to light. In the Chinese books which contain illustrations to the classics the roofs of temples are indeed turned up at the eaves, but this, I think, must be an error. It would arise partly from an incorrect way of representing in perspective the lines round a corner, and partly from the habit which most people have of carrying the present into the past and making their ancestors responsible for their own peculiarities. The early architecture of the Chinese was plain, geometrical and practically useful. The love of fantastic curves in the lower part of roofs came into vogue later, and must be sought rather in Buddhism.\n\nIn the Book of Odes we have the grandfather of Wen-wang removing to the south of Chi-shan in Shan-si. This he did for the sake of peace. The tribes of Tartary annoyed him. He left them his old territory and cultivated new lands. He built a new home, and in erecting it used the plumb-line and a wooden wall-frame. Boards are roped together and earth is filled in between them. Such earth hammered down constitutes a wall, and this is still the mode of building used in the north in making earthen walls. When the wall is washed away by rain they build another. This simple style was adapted to an undeveloped state of society, and building by this method allowed houses to be very rapidly erected. Two doors were sufficient\u2014the kau men, or \"high\" gate or outer enclosure gate, and the inner or answering or central gate.\n\nOn account of the universal belief in omens it was usual to divine by the tortoise to know if the locality selected was a good one. In ancient China we can judge of the customs of the people in the second millennium before Christ by the three older classics. In the Book of Odes, building was not commenced without an omen of a favourable character. This was done when Tai-wang moved south-west from the valley of\nthe King river, in which lay his old residential city Pin, to the south of Chi-shan, in the valley of the Wei river. He then inscribed on the shell of a tortoise certain lines, and upon scoring it received such an answer that he knew that the site he had arrived at would be suitable. The cardinal points were determined and the simple laws of ancient architecture were followed.\n\nOrientation was made an important point, and there was provision for religious ceremonies. A burnt sacrifice, for instance, was offered even in front of private houses in summer, and on that occasion the altar was on the south-east, the worship being that of the god of fire. This seems to show that the worship of the five elements was intimately connected with the ancient rules of house-building.\n\nBeside the kau men and ging men, there was a gate called the \"tiger gate,\" from a picture of a tiger drawn there, as the symbol of bravery. This was to add to the dignity of the master of the house. It was outside the kau men. Within was the \"pleasant gate,\" from the representation probably also of that bird drawn there. Outside of it were lofty pillars or flag-posts and standard measures for markets to follow.\n\nThe art of house-building was spread among the Tartar tribes by the Cheu family when they took refuge from the tyranny of the Shang dynasty in the Pin country, fifty miles north-west of Si-an-fu, and rather near the western boundary of the province of Shen-si. There the aboriginal tribes had lived in loess caves. This kind of house is there very convenient, warm, well-protected and economical. The loess deposits where they occur are found in the valleys with a vertical front of uncertain height varying from a few feet to several hundred feet. The rude savages who had been living in a single room were taught to make double chambers and upper rooms by their new friends from civilized China. This their friends did by instructing them in the art of making bricks in kilns.\nThis seems to be the meaning of the passage *t'ao fu t'ao hsin*\u2014\n\"they taught the aborigines to make double houses and dig\ncaves with the help of the kiln.\" Yet the commentators\nexplain the passage differently, as if it was meant to say that the\npeople were taught to live in kilns, and Leaeg explains that\nthe houses were shaped like kilns. In Richthoven's *China*\nthere is a picture of houses in five stories one above another,\nall of them having arched windows and doors. There is an\noutside staircase connecting the houses of each story. On the\nopposite page is another front of a house hollowed out of a\nloess bank. It is fenced by a low wall on the outside. This\nhouse, hollowed out of a loess bank, communicates with the\noutside simply by three windows and a door.\n\nOn the whole the classical architecture had square and\nround buildings and double roofs, but it lacked the arch, and\nthe modern *ping-tsz* was still undeveloped. Halls were matted.\nThere were no chairs, but there were low tables. Lucky days\nwere selected for building. The emperor's throne was a high\ndais on which he sat cross-legged and facing the south.\nHis personal suite stood behind him and on his right and left.\nThe ministers of state stood in rows on the east and west. In\nthe open space between them, individuals came forward and\nprostrated themselves to speak to the emperor and answer\nquestions. There were three audience-halls, that of the daily\naudience for a few persons, near the private apartments, that\nof the court generally, more to the front, and that of great\nfestivals, still more to the southward. The arrangement was\nsomething like what it is at present in Peking. The ministers\nheld batons in their hands, or writing brush and tablets. In\nthe larger assemblies the greater part of the nobles and offi-\ncers prostrated themselves in their places in an open-paved\ncourt which was unroofed. The emperor and his suite were\non a raised platform which was roofed. In ancient times\nNorth China had a mild climate in winter, and the grandees,\nclad in fox-skins, would not feel cold. The ancestral temple is specially marked out for admiration in the Four Books, just at the end, where Confucius is compared to a house whose encompassing wall is much higher than that of all common persons. An observer may see the beauty of a common house by looking over the wall. But the wall of the house of Confucius is several yards high. The disciple, in fervent love for his master, adds that it is with him as with an ancestral temple. It must be entered if its beauty is to be seen. When he said this he was thinking of the double roof, the vermilion pillars of the hall, and within the tablets and the offerings, with the beautiful ornamented vases placed in order before each. Before perspective was ever studied the perspective lines of light and shade caused by these objects would be in his mind, and he would pronounce the effect of the whole to be beautiful. It was the most fitting image he could find to represent the superiority of his master to all other men.\n\nArchitecture is introduced with the gnomon and its shadow. A vessel of water is hung up by a string so as to obtain a level. When meeting with this in the Chow-li, that valuable repertory of archaeological knowledge, no reader will fail to picture to himself the ancient artificer clad in coarse linen in summer, or sheep-skin in winter, determining for himself the level of water for the wall of a house he is building. To have his work strictly according to the cardinal points he marks the shadow of his gnomon. For imperial use there was a gnomon of which the length was eight feet, or 5\u00bd of our English feet. They had the plumb-line, by which they could make the pillars of wood, which supported the roof, perfectly straight. They had also the mason's rule, which they called kwei \u89c4, and they used it to secure that the bricks of their walls should be laid evenly, and the walls themselves be both horizontal and vertical.\n\nAccording to the Chow-li the ancient art of house-building\nwas controlled by astronomy. It is mentioned that the mason's rule\u2014kwei\u2014was placed level with the sun at his rising and at his setting. The builders also looked at stars by night to ensure a perfect level, and to obtain an exactly south fa\u00e7ade. In the old architecture of China this was viewed as very important, as it was also in Egypt and Babylon. In these countries the old civilization produced this scientific element in the buildings of the time. Heaven, earth and man are in harmony according to the Chinese idea, and the emperor's palace could not be erected otherwise than facing the south, four square, and with its four walls strictly north, south, east and west. At present it is admitted that the architecture of the pyramid builders was wonderfully accurate in its aspect as regards the heavenly bodies. The great pyramid was not only a tomb for the sovereign, but an observatory from which the stars as they passed the meridian could be observed from its interior with extreme exactness. It is therefore not more than what we might expect to find the art of the builder of palaces in old China also, but in a rougher way, controlled by astronomy and the principles of trigonometry. This part of the modern art of architecture in the West is without doubt traceable to the early Asiatic and African civilization, just as the trigonometry and geometry of the Greeks were suggested to them by the plumb-line, the water-level and the gnomon. It was not Euclid that discovered the properties of the right-angled triangle. They were known to Pythagoras, and before the time of Pythagoras they were familiar to the wise men of Babylon and of Egypt. He travelled in those countries and he was the first to introduce geometry among his countrymen. China also knew, eleven centuries before Christ, the properties of the right-angled triangle.\n\nThe capital city must be a square of nine li, and there being about six li in an English mile, the whole circumference is a mile and a half. It must be square and have three gates in each\nwall. It is the city in which the emperor resides. In front of it on the south-east is the ancestral temple, and on the south-west is the altar of the gods of the land. This is just the arrangement followed in Peking in the plan of the palace. In front of it on the east is the Temple of Ancestors, and on the west the Sh\u00ea ts\u00ee t'\u00e2n. The Emperor Yung lo erected this palace and the Manchus inherited it, occupying the old imperial residence when they conquered the country. But it is otherwise with the gates. According to the ancient plan the emperor's city had twelve gates leading from it. Behind was the market, and in front the emperor met the court every morning. Each of the twelve gates led to a street broad enough to allow of a carriage-way in the middle and a trottoir for men on the right and women on the left. The modern arrangement is different.\n\nImperial editions of the classics, such as the \u6b3d\u5b9a\u5468\u5b98\u7fa9\u758f Ch'in ting Chen kwan Yi su, contain illustrations which deserve study, because they are the result of the profound examination not only of old texts but of sculptures rescued from mounds. Attention should be given to the well system of agriculture in this connection. Ancient China was always feudal, and the emperor could command the service of the people of each barony. Agriculture was the basis. The workers of the soil gave a share of their work to the cultivation of common land. In providing for labour in the erection of palaces and imperial temples, the feudal system supplied it, and as that system was based on the justice and benevolence of the sovereign, the people came, says an old classical record, like sons to work for a parent.\nII.\u2014Architecture of the Post-Confucian Age.\n\nThe architecture of the time when the power of the sovereign had declined in China became special by the changed conditions. Feudal chiefs ascended independent thrones and fought with each other for supremacy. A struggle for hegemony became an evil which was chronic. There was a two hundred years' war, and machines were constructed for taking cities, the mode of making which is described in *M\u00e8tsi*.\n\nThis state of affairs led to rivalry in palace building. The Imperial revenue was in the hands of the feudal chiefs, and with the people's money they built beautiful palaces and surrounded them with pleasure-gardens. Among them may be particularly mentioned the park and palace of the Wizard Mountain, just beyond I-chang, at the entrance to the beautiful land of Szechwan, where there is now a British Consul and a foreign community of merchants. The fact that the gorges should have been selected as the spot chosen for the site of a feudal palace plainly shows that poetic feeling ruled. In fact, at that time, there sprang up a school of vigorous poetry which has never failed since to influence the literature of this country. The romantic element could not fail, therefore, to appear in architecture, and so we find it. In the architecture of the Han dynasty there is a most remarkable grouping of romantic creations with a reproduction of historic scenes of an exciting and didactic kind, for there are both. Should someone ask, how was the spirit of poetry introduced into palaces and temples in their construction? the answer must be, by painting and sculpture. It is said in the *Shih ki* that \"the Emperor is lord of the Four\nAll people constitute his family. If his palace were not ornamental he would not possess sufficient dignity. The palace must therefore be richly ornamented.\" In the palace they recognized the need of depth in the suite of rooms or courts through which the visitor is conducted to the audience-chamber. The architect built with this in view; he had to conceal the sovereign and his family within a succession of courts. He had to provide him with pleasure-gardens. This was imitated by the sovereigns of all the kingdoms of the Chinese heptarchy. Their palaces and parks became all the property of the Chin dynasty in the end of the third century before Christ. By the Chin Emperor's command a palace was built in the Wei valley, near Hien yang, the capital, to represent that of each distinct kingdom, and the peculiar construction employed in erecting the palaces of each with their ornaments would here be reproduced. The Ah fang was the most splendid, being the favorite palace of the Chin Emperors. We can tell the style of the architecture, for it is believed by Chinese critics to be represented in the Chia-siang sculptures. In the scene referred to we find roofs, pillars, low conches, and various architectural details fully represented. There is an audience-chamber in a pleasure-garden: above it is a gallery, and in front of it a large, high tree. The gallery presents a queen sitting on a dais with five female attendants. Below is a king, or noble, seated on a dais, before whom two officers are prostrate and knocking their heads against the ground. The queen wears a five-leaved crown, and the king the court-hat of the time, rising in front by a straight line deflected outwards and having a flat top falling to the crown. The roof of the gallery has men for its supports, that is to say, the pillars of the roof are Caryatides, and like Mount Atlas personified. The roof of the audience-chamber is supported by round pillars having three simple straight mouldings.\nabove, which relieve the angularity. The round wooden pillar rests on a round stone as now in the modern Chinese style. The roof is tiled without the modern concave. At the ends of the upper roof-line large bricks are deflected upward and outward to a point, to remove the angularity there. Peacocks and monkeys are sculptured on the roof-line, as also winged men and various birds walking or resting.\n\nA great peculiarity of the mythological period was the representation of historical scenes. It was before the age of theatrical representation which began in the Tang dynasty, but was only thoroughly inaugurated at the end of the Sung. The historic groups on the sculptured walls of the Chia-siang ancestral chapel are an example of how architecture makes use of history as a teacher. The great men of past times live again before the visitor's eye. As he passes along the ancestral chapel in its three compartments the guide points out to him on the eastern wall of the central hall the sculptured form of Fu hi, founder of the national civilization, who was, as I suppose, an ancient Chinese monarch, who received reverently from Babylon certain instructors in architecture and civilization, and to express this thought vividly he appears with the mason's rule in his hand. What gave him power over the people was scientific and civilizing wisdom. The termination of his body is partly that of a fish. It ends with a fish-tail, denoting that the sculptured idea is foreign. In the classics, Fu hi had not a fish-tail. He was a man like other men, but we are now in the age of mythological architecture. He is closely joined by intertwining of the tail with that of Tsang kie, who also holds a mason's rule right angled. Shen nung follows with the plough, and the Yellow Emperor, who first taught the people in the loess country to dig wells, to divide their fields evenly for irrigation, and to wear dignified robes with broad sleeves and a girdle. The Emperor Yau follows, who taught morality; Shun\nsucceeds him, who taught astronomy; and Yu, founder of a great dynasty, who, when immense floods checked the labours of agriculture and drove the people to the high grounds to live in tents, undertook the control of the rivers, and restored the land to the cultivators. Then the rise of the Chow dynasty is pointed out with scenes from the history and poetry of the classics. This is followed by groups of an exciting character such as assassinations and battles from the age of Confucius and the two centuries which followed. The rise of the Chin Empire is also sculptured. Here battles on bridges and in rivers and in the air occur, with tiger-hunts, grotesque groups to excite laughter, and many festive scenes.\n\nWith such sculptured groups the emperors and princes of the Han dynasty adorned their palaces. The artists of those times were extremely fond of grotesque scenes and monstrous shapes. The sculptured halls of that age are reflected in the poetry, which consisted of long descriptive pieces, like Thomson's \"Castle of Indolence\" or the separate books of the Faerie Queene. The princes of the house of Lien gathered round them a choice school of literati and engaged them in discussions on the history of early times and on philosophical and religious dogmas. They talked about Confucius and Lau tsu, and wrote books for the princes and for the emperor. The subjects on which they wrote were politics, history, popular mythology, architecture and astronomy, and they compiled these works in prose or in poetry. A good number of them remain to us, and the discovery of the Chia-siang and other inscriptions and sculptures is a great help to the understanding of China as it was in the Han dynasty.\n\nI learn from Lieutenant D. Mills, who wrote to me in February 1887, when he had just visited the spot where these sculptures were exhumed, that, \"the valley in which they\noccurrence is about five square miles in area, and that the excavation was less than ten feet deep, but it would fill up quickly.\" The two gate-pillars stand in the excavation, rising about ten feet above the ground. The stone of these pillars has weathered brown. A large number of slabs have been taken out of the soil, and are now set up in an oblong tiled building, fifty feet by twenty, lining its walls without any orderly arrangement. Since the erection of this house other slabs have been dug out, and are piled on the ground in the house, which has no room for them upon its walls. The cutting on the sculptured slabs is about a tenth of an inch deep.\n\nThere would be village temples in the Han dynasty, erected to ancestors, as also to the gods of thunder, rain, and wind, and to the Great Bear and the gods of grain and agriculture. All have perished, because they were constructed with a wooden framework. The reason why this ancestral chapel of a prince, consisting of three chambers, has survived the storms and frosts of seventeen centuries, is that it was of stone.\n\nA stone chapel with a stone roof entirely or almost entirely consisting of sculptured slabs and unsculptured slabs, was exposed to winds which blew dust upon it, and floods which dashed silt round it and filled up its interior, till it became buried more than twelve feet deep. The two stone pillars in front of it were twenty-five feet high, and are now buried to about that depth. This is a fact which shows what winds and floods can do in seventeen centuries in raising the soil. It also shows the supreme excellence of stone architecture, which is capable of preserving to us these valuable memorials of the China of the Han dynasty. The chapel dates from A.D. 147. The Pantheon is older by 174 years.\n\nLieutenant D. Mills, in his visit to the Chia-sinng inscriptions in situ, observed no traces of wooden beams in any of the stones belonging to the original chapel buildings. The\nPantheon in Rome when it has stood for eighty-three years longer will be two thousand years old. It is a circular building with a stone roof. The ancestral chapels in Shantung were rectangular stone buildings with two gables which fell in part many centuries ago, but the loess, with friendly assistance, buried the sculptured stones under the soil. The buildings would in part be standing till quite recently, or the sculptured stones at least were preserved in good order where they fell. So far was this the case that the native archaeologists have been able to tell us to a large extent what part of the buildings was occupied by each particular stone.\n\nThe question must here be confronted, how much of the Han dynasty architecture is of foreign origin? In the Archaeological Survey of India, kindly lent me by Mr. Kingsmill, we find in the 1st volume, published in 1871, the question discussed how Greek sculpture is found occupying a place in Buddhist architecture. To this question General Cunningham replies, that Bactrian Greek sculptors would find ready employment for their services among wealthy Buddhists, just as later in the time of the Mogul Empire goldsmiths and artillerymen were employed by the sovereigns. It was a Buddhist custom to make gifts of statues and pillars to the monasteries. This gave continuous employment to many skilled workmen. In the city of Mathura, which lies on the Jumna between Delhi and Agra, there is a colossal image of Buddha the Teacher, measuring one foot across the palm. It would be thirty feet in height. The Chinese have such in their country, where the stone is easily cut and the Buddhist zeal of the community favoured the production of this kind of work. The statue was from 20 to 24 feet in height. Buddha\n\n---\n\n2 In the Island of Jersey there is a stone chapel erected A.D. 1111. Its roof is of stone. It has stood more than 700 years\u2014a signal instance of the permanence of stone roofs\u2014but the roof has been replaced recently by a new one.\nis represented as the Teacher, explaining the law to his disciples. It should be remembered that the coming and the laughing Buddha are one. In one of the female figures the attitude is peculiar. The left hand is brought across the right breast while the right hand holds up a small portion of drapery. The head is inclined slightly to the right shoulder. The hair is dressed in a new fashion, with long curls on each side of the face, which fall from a large circular ornament on the top of the head. This figure has a plump face with a broad smile, and it is one of the best specimens of unaided Indian art which General Cunningham had met with. He goes on to notice specimens of Greek sculpture mixed with that of the Hindoos. The costumes of the sculptured figures are Hindoo, Greek and those of some other unknown nation. There is represented in one place a Greek altar such as was dedicated to Bacchus. Adjoining a well-carved elephant in one place are certain inscriptions which contain the names of five Greek kings, including Alexander and Antiochus.\n\nIn the fifth volume of the Archaeological Survey of India the Doric character of architecture in Cashmere is illustrated. In some localities in North-Western India there was Indo-Corinthian and in other localities Indo-Persian. The Ionic style was introduced in Taxila and the Corinthian in Gandhara. All these styles flourished for several centuries. Thus, as far as stone was used in building, the imitation of Greek architecture and sculpture would naturally follow, and would spread into distant countries. But India, like ancient China, was well wooded, and, therefore, wooden pillars and beams continued to be used.\n\nIn the case of monasteries, pagodas, tombs and bridges, with certain other structures, stone was held to be better as a material. Civilization, commerce and national intercourse brought more and more wealth to the communities, and these buildings were erected by the gifts of individuals. In such\nBuddhist Style.\n\nenses there would be a tendency to imitate Western art. This would gradually lead to the arch in bridge-building. So also the broad verandah, necessary in India to shade a bungalow from the sun, would lead to broad roofs, which were afterwards imitated by the Chinese.\n\nThe influence of Greek art would enter as an element in the Han sculptures in the following manner. The country being rich and at peace, many foreign improvements would be adopted. Workmen would be conveyed from a distance to do work for wealthy persons. These workmen would be instructed by skilled masters, who were either Greeks or the pupils of other masters who were taught by Greeks. In this way we may account for sculptured horses represented successfully in attitudes which without a long apprenticeship could not easily be produced.\n\nIII.\u2014Buddhist Architecture.\n\nThe third period of Chinese Architecture is the Buddhist. When the Hindoo Missionaries came to China to propagate their religion, they were lodged in an official building, called a si, and in consequence of this their monasteries were called si ever after. But the form they took in building was that of the Vihara, the Sanscrit name for a Buddhist monastery. The Buddhist monastery in China may have native Chinese features in some things, as when, for example, we find there the hall for ancestral tablets, in which the deceased priests of the monastery are honoured with worship, wooden tablets being used, just as in Confucian ancestral worship. But the great outline is Indian.\n\nThere may be gate lions, one on each side of the gate. The gods of native Hindoo polytheism are placed in the entrance-\nhall. This is the locality in which the defenders of the Buddhist faith should be honoured. Here also is found the laughing Buddha, the Buddha of the future. Then come the bell and drum towers. Within is the teaching-hall of Buddha. The normal height of the statue known as the \"teaching Buddha\" is 16 feet, which probably is represented by ten feet eight inches in English measurement. Much smaller figures are commonly used. The pictures or statues on the east and west or right and left of Buddha are his audience. They consist of the gods of Brahminism, and of renowned Buddhist saints. Behind in another large hall is either the sleeping Buddha, or the ascetic Buddha, or the guiding Buddha, who is called Omito Fo, or the Buddha of the future, Maitseya, surpassing all the forms of Buddha in height. The other buildings are numerous. They provide living-apartments for the abbot and the monks under him, refectory, rooms for guests, kitchens, store-rooms, library, halls for the worship of the inferior divinities of Buddhism, and for the complete representation, so far as practicable, of the Buddhist world of worship, of suffering, of joy, of punishment, of salvation. In a Buddhist monastery the object of the architecture, and of the sculptured and pictorial representations, is to exhibit the world as it appears to the Buddhist. Buddha is enthroned on the lotus as teacher and redeemer, and the universe pays him homage.\n\nThe lion is not an Indian animal, but is or was Persian and Syrian. The Buddhists borrowed it as an ornament in their mythological conceptions from that part of the world. The whole ideology of Western Asia pressed into India in the age of the Persian dynasty of Cyrus and in part before that time. The lion very soon appears in the Buddhist books, though not in the lifetime of Buddha himself. Why, then, did the disciples of Buddha in North-Western India eagerly adopt this animal as a symbol, the animal being foreign.\nIt was because they were disputants, and in combating with Persians, Greeks and men of other races who engaged in religious disputation, they found that the lion was considered king of beasts and the symbol of victory. It is found, for example, in the Book of Genesis and other parts of the Bible as a symbol of power, courage and victory. The north-western Buddhists adopted it, as they did images and cosmogony from the nations which lay on that side of India, and used it in the service of their religion.\n\nThe pagoda was specially a Hindu mausoleum for relics of Buddha. It is surprising how little it is used in Japan or in Lamaism. Osaka has but one pagoda and Tokio none. It is very much connected with the feng shui superstition, which was never adopted by the Japanese, and with the worship of relics. The number of stories is always odd, because odd numbers are male while even numbers are female. To benefit a locality the pagoda must have the power of Yang, the male principle. It is the dark principle Yin which does mischief. Pagodas are often built entirely of stone or brick. Quite commonly they have sculptured entablatures representing the life of Buddha, or scenes in the biography of some Buddhist saint.\n\nMany pagodas are very pretty objects, and they have come to be a special characteristic of Chinese architecture. The curling eaves of Chinese buildings are probably an imitation of some early pagodas. They were erected in large numbers from the sixth century onwards, and since China has no explanation to offer of curling eaves, it seems necessary to assign them to a foreign source.\n\nThe erection of pagodas was a test of the skill of native architects, many of them being lofty, and built without wood. That they have been fairly successful in erecting strong buildings is evidenced by the fact that there are more old pagodas existing than there are old houses or temples. From the\nseventh century onwards, there are still structures of this class. There is an octagonal pagoda in Peking of thirteen stories, and it dates from the year A.D. 600. The sculptured figures are all of moulded brick, and this is the material which has been largely used in erecting this pagoda. It is 275 feet 5 inches in height. This building, so high and so well preserved, is a good specimen of the durability of some Buddhist work in China.\n\nThe efforts of Buddhist architects were very much directed to the provision of images of a large size and great variety. Several types grew up which had to be constantly reproduced in new erections. Buddhism teaches contemplation, and does so by images as well as by books. The propagators of this religion aimed to gain the popular ear by appealing impressively to the eye.\n\nThe laughing Buddha at the gate indicates that the religion there professed is the pathway of joy. The second form of Buddha is that of teacher. The teaching Buddha is therefore the central object in the principal hall. Around are seen his audience of divinities and human beings. In some other hall is represented the ascetic Buddha, it may be with unshorn head and the attire of a hermit. The sleeping Buddha is quite a favourite subject. Some examples of this type are very ancient, coming down from the Tang dynasty, and made of sandalwood or copper. The guiding Buddha leads the soul to Paradise. The rock-hewn Buddha, of 16, 30 or 60 feet high, is like the laughing Buddha, the Buddha of the future.\n\nAnother effort made by Buddhist architects was to represent the Buddhist world in its completeness, or specially some part of it. Five towers on a lofty terrace represent the universe, as north, south, east, west and centre. Such is the Wu ta si, or monastery of the five pagodas, in Peking. When ordered to pray for rain, the Buddhist priests arrange the images in a square in some spot in the fields which appears\nsuitable. The arrangement is made on this principle. Rock-work is much used to represent imaginary worlds. Mud or clay is the material, and paint of many colours is used to deck out in the gayest finery grottos, bridges, winding-ways among mountains, temples and lakes. Some scene may have been drawn by a poet, or the writer of a Buddhist work in prose. A time comes when a decoration is required in a temple under repair. The scene of a book is then realized in mortar and paint.\n\nOther features in Chinese house-building which are a tradition of the Buddhist age are the screen before the gate, and the figures on the roofs. Both these features are connected with *feng shui*, which, being an article of popular belief, it becomes requisite to protect buildings from the mischief likely to be caused by evil beings moving towards a house and capable of doing harm to the inmates.\n\nThe screen of brick-work, built like the character *pa* (eight), does not appear in old sculptures and has no ancient equivalent. It is an unpleasing feature which ought to be dismissed from modern architecture, but *feng shui*, unfortunately, insists upon it.\n\nSo it is with the little monsters seen on the line of a roof or on the projecting ledges below. They must, like the stories of pagodas, be in odd numbers, in order that the *Yang* principle may prevail over the *Yin*. Though their forms are so sinister looking, they are all friendly, and their ugliness is put on for effect's sake. Their office is to deter evil spirits. The dragon and monkey are the types of these figures. Both are in odd numbers; the larger is the dragon, usually one only, while the smaller is the monkey, which may be three, five or more. I have been at some pains to learn what they mean, and this is the result. It is probably one of those architectural peculiarities which the Chinese may claim as their own. But this is not certain. From Shanghai to Suez, all along\nthe southern coast of the continent of Asia, the people believe in the active agency of evil spirits constantly in motion and seeking opportunities to inflict evil on mankind. Against them protectors are sought for of every available class, and among them are these creatures which suit alike the Arab, the Persian, the Hindoo and the Chinese.\n\nThe result was that in house-building it was felt to be necessary to use protective measures against the forces of evil always threatening danger to men. The gate-screen and the small monster on the roof have the same office as the charm pasted over a door, or the amulet, the small bottle, the bronze mirror, carried on the person. They were supposed to have a magical effect of a defensive nature.\n\nThe result was disastrous in an architectural sense. The gate-screen conceals the entrance, and is placed where it is not wanted. It must as such be unpleasing. But popular superstition clings to the gate-screen. It lives still after many centuries of useless encumbrance. Outside the gate there is the pa character wall, within the gate is a screen. On each side is a lion. On the roof of the chief building are metamorphosed monkeys and dragons. We can bear the animal shapes for the sake of the grotesque, which human nature loves, but we cannot bear with the same equanimity the hiding of the front view. Our European training has led us to appreciate the excellent effect of an open view in front. To shut off from view the front of a building, is a mistake.\n\nGilding images was common in India about A.D. 500, and probably earlier. The Buddhists, by introducing the practice of gilding Buddha's image, greatly increased the impressiveness of their temples. This was a new element of beauty added to their architecture, which did not fail to affect the people powerfully in many ways. Let this point be well considered. In Europe, ent stone assumes a dark hue, especially in England. We enter a Chinese Buddhist temple as we see it in Hangzhou.\nor in Peking. The beautiful colour of the gold image, untarnished after many years, is felt to be in itself pleasing. We then become conscious that to gild Prince Albert's Monument in Hyde Park and the statue of Victory in Berlin, was a useful preservative against weathering. The Chinese learned the effective use of gold in ornamentation from the Buddhists.\n\nIV.\u2014Architecture of the Modern Period.\n\nPrinting commenced in the tenth century and, the Sung dynasty attaining power at that time, was accompanied by a Tanist revival. Of this there are several indications. The first Emperor, Ch'au t'ai tsu, had a Tanist friend, Chen twan, who, with the emperor's powerful aid, forwarded his own religious views. The predilections of the founder were shared by his descendants. Among them, Hwei tsung was a great lover of Tanism. The Fukien goddess Ma tsu, the sailor's favourite, belongs to this period. So also does the worship of Kwan ti, the god of loyalty, the favorite divinity of soldiers. Lii tsu, or L\u00fc chun yang, the famous Tanist of the latter part of the eighth and the first half of the ninth century made Tanism popular near Lu shan, on the north-west shore of the Poyang Lake. Temples began to be erected to him in the twelfth century. The early Sung dynasty was then a time of rapid progress in popular Tanism. Nothing marks modern China more than the spread of Tanist worship in imitation of Buddhist worship, and this took place specially in the tenth, eleventh and twelfth centuries.\n\nThis fact implies a rapid spread of temple-building; that is to say, Buddhist architecture was imitated most extensively at this time. It was a foreign art in several respects, and\nthrough its being very full of idealism, it won its way to the heart of the Chinese. As to the form of the monastery and the arrangement of the halls, this imitation doubtless began in the Taug dynasty. But there was then no extensive national imitation embracing all parts of the empire. This appears to have taken place in the Sung dynasty, as the examples just given combine to show.\n\nIn a large Taoist temple, such as the Taug yo mian, in Peking, in the first small halls at the door in the neighbourhood of the Bell and Drum towers, are certain military images. They indicate protection to the religion of which this is a temple. In this they simply repeat the idea of the hall of the four kings who, at the entrance to a Buddhist Monastery, take the part of the defenders of Buddhism. Beyond is the hall in which the god of the east mountain is worshipped. He takes the place of the teaching Buddha of Buddhism. In the temple of the god of medicine in Peking, in front are distinguished physicians of antiquity. Behind them is the central idol, that of Y\u00fc hwang. Further still behind is the hall consecrated to the worship of the Three Pure Ones. Such a disposition of the halls and statues is mostly taken from the Buddhists.\n\nWe see, then, that the Confucianists had in the Sung dynasty ceased to be enemies to Buddhism. They saw that the foreign idolatry was popular, and they decided to leave it to work out its own future. They made deities of native origin, like L\u00fc chun yung, Ma tsu and Kwan y\u00fc, and everywhere temples were erected in their honour. Temples had been Confucian and Buddhist. They now became Confucian, Buddhist, and Taoist. An extraordinary number of new temples must have been erected in the Sung dynasty by the Taoists. The emperors favoured them, and this led the people to favour them also. The Ch'eng hwang mian in each district city and prefectural city seems now to be an\nessential part of Chinese institutions. But it is not in fact older than the Sung dynasty in most cities. I have noticed one which was erected in A.D. 917, in the Wu tai period, so that probably this type of temple was first introduced in the Tang dynasty, but it was the partiality of the Sung imperial family for Taoism, and the tolerant political tone of the Sung literati, which spread this sort of temple and other types of Taoist sacred buildings throughout the empire.\n\nIn the Sung dynasty, the first part of the modern age of Chinese architecture, we have the results of the devotion of the nation to Buddhism during seven centuries. Two great forces have animated the nation since that time. The one was the Confucian and Taoist revival of the Sung dynasty, the other was the school of critical research of the present dynasty. The Confucian revival led to political toleration, and so foreign architecture, for example, might be imitated without offence. The principles of the Chinese Government from the tenth century forward have allowed men of different religions to reside together, and the magistrate is expected to keep the peace between them if they offend. The consequence is, that Hindoo, Moslem and new European architecture, in the erection of the sacred buildings of each religion, are seen together in China. Toleration of foreign religious tenets has favoured the mixing of styles in buildings and in art generally. This freedom of choice has been encouraged by the critical attitude of the literati in the present dynasty. China is now more eclectic than it ever was.\n\nThe school of critical research which has flourished during the last two centuries has paid special attention to the classics, and among them to the Chou-li, whence facts on ancient architecture are gathered. It is singular that there should be important differences of opinion on the manner in which the Temple of Heaven ought to be built, and whether Confucius ought to have a statue in his temple or not. The result of\nresearches in the Ming dynasty led to the abandonment of the statue of Confucius and the restoration of the old Confucian tablet. This was an instance of recoil from Buddhist views of art. Yet in some cities the statue remains, the decree of the emperor on the subject not having been very peremptory. But the spirit of modern China is against the use of statues in Confucian worship. The Buddhist love of statues in temples does not in any way influence the true Confucianist, who glories in his freedom from popular Buddhism. So also during last century it was decided not to have dual worship at the Temple of Heaven, but to worship there only the Supreme Ruler.\n\nThe Sung dynasty architecture is not specially known by examples, because it has been outshone by the works of the Yuen and the Ming dynasties, but it may be studied, because books printed with engravings exist, and there are much fuller details and materials for research in that age than previously. For the ancestral temple, for example, it is interesting to find that Chu fu tsai made inquiry into it, and determined its essential features. The Chinese art of the Golden dynasty in North China remains in a few octagonal pillars inscribed with Buddhist charms. Sanscrit and Chinese characters are here seen cut in limestone.\n\nArt rose higher in the Yuen dynasty, and the Ch\u00fc yung kwan arch and inscription, which have stood for six hundred years, shew that China at that time undertook to develop new types of architectural work. But the Yuen dynasty architecture was surpassed by that of the Ming dynasty. It was then that Chinese art rose to its greatest height. The Emperor Cheng tsu, of the Yung lo period, was the greatest of the Ming line. It was he that made Peking what it is. The plan of the city, the tombs, the great bell, the fortified passes in the Great Wall are his. These and the grandeur of the city gates and wall belong to the Ming dynasty and to him in particular. In\nthe time of Shun chi and Kang hi, an effort was made to improve the astronomical observatory. This was done by removing the observing instruments from the tower and replacing them by machines cast by Verbiest and some presented by the French king. Underneath the tower is the chamber for observing the length of the shadow at the winter solstice and on other occasions. Peking is the only capital in the world on whose wall is seen a collection of large bronze instruments intended for astronomical observation. They lend a character of refinement to the city to which they belong.\n\nThe influence of the Emperor Chien lung was directed to the production of substantial architecture in various styles. His Buddhist, Confucian, Moslem and Italian erections were well done in their day. Yet now the relentless changes wrought by time have reduced many of them to a ruinous state. His Italian structures at Yuen ming yuen were burnt in the war of 1861. High civilization and refinement led this Emperor to look kindly on fashions of all nations and to take pleasure in introducing them into his country. It will never cease to be a subject of regret that the buildings in the parks outside of Peking were burnt. There must be something wrong when it is found necessary to burn works of art.\n\nIn the changes made by the Emperor Chien lung in the temple of Confucius there is a distinct aim to restore the ancient classical structure\u2014the Pi yung kung. The brevity of classic texts renders exact restoration to a large extent conjectural. In this case there is a circular marble tank. In the centre is a hall in which is a throne for the Emperor when he expounds the classics. The south face of this hall consists entirely of lofty doors admitting light through thin bamboo paper.\n\nIn the architectural works of the present dynasty, as of the Ming, the jeng shui ideas have never been abandoned. China has ceased to build new pagodas for the sake of riches\nand prosperity to a locality, but she puts the old ones in repair when money can be obtained for the purpose. The roofs of temples are still ornamented with a view to *feng shui* opposite to the openings of lanes in Peking. Lions are set up, or stones with the powerful name of the Tai shan god, to frighten away demons who might be intending to come that way. The superstition of *feng shui* is retained in house architecture even in this age of growing knowledge. In judging of Chinese architecture there are two chief divisions of work to be looked at. The one is its general excellence, the effect of dignity, solemnity, richness and grandeur on the whole. The other is the special excellence of the parts. In both there is room for the greatest genius. In regard to the former, it may be noticed that the greatest triumph of Chinese architecture is in the effect on the whole. In the Ming tombs we have the perfection of Chinese power of arrangement. It is a ride of seven miles from the entrance of the valley to the tomb of Yung lo. The valley is occupied by the thirteen tombs. At the entrance the marble gateway attracts special attention. Ninety feet long by fifty high, composed of marble, and seeming to be roofed with tiles, it is seen from a great distance, and it has stood for three centuries and a half. On nearer inspection it is found that the roof is cut marble, and when this fact is observed, the whole structure is seen to be a remarkable triumph of architecture. The Pai len of China takes the place of the triumphal arch of Europe, and this one at the Ming tombs is the best in the country. It was erected at a time when the Chinese building and bell-casting art reached their culminating point. The original red and green colours have long since weathered down to a sober grey. Passing this we proceed through several avenues of trees and several gateways till the avenue of animals is reached\u2014a truly striking feature. Lions, unicorns, camels and elephants stand and kneel in pairs. The four elephants are each cut\nfrom one stone. They are 13 feet high and 14 feet long. Thus it is seen that the Chinese are capable of Egyptian effects in working in stone if only their country did not consist of alluvial plains, which necessitate a brick architecture. Then the hall for sacrifice is the third great feature. It is 70 yards long by 30 deep. The teak pillars, 12 feet round and 32 feet high, are 32 in number. The building is 64 feet high. It is reached by a marble ascent of 18 steps, and is surrounded by beautifully-carved balustrades. The roof juts out 10 feet beyond the walls on which it rests. The fourth great feature of the Ming tombs is the tomb itself, above this passage. In front of it is a mass of solid stonework which supports the monumental stone on which is inscribed in characters of enormous size the posthumous name of the Emperor Yung lo, who died A.D. 1425. Beneath is the coffin-passage, 39 yards long, conducing to the tomb-door, and the visitor arriving there ascends to the platform above by a long staircase. Here the stone, three feet thick, two yards wide, and high in proportion, with the Emperor\u2019s name on it, may be observed. It was originally painted with vermilion. Then there is the mound, half a mile in circuit, containing a hemispherical chamber, in which is the coffin. The chamber is large enough to hold probably 400 persons.\n\nIn this work of construction we see Chinese architectural skill at its acme of power. So many remarkable features combine in the Ming tombs that we must in this instance award to Chinese architecture the praise of success in imparting to the imperial tombs an air of great dignity and solemnity.\n\nChinese art is to be praised for the lightness and grace of the curve of a heavy roof. The Greek loved to see lines of beauty at the head of a column, and a succession of columns seen in vanishing perspective has a very lovely effect. The\neffort of Chinese art is rather to lighten the appearance of heavy masses of timber in a roof by curves and the use of coloured tiles.\n\nIn the modern style we find the shaft of a column carved with dragons, and this mode of ornamentation has lately become commoner than it was. It is observable in the guild-houses of Ningpo and Hankow. If in Shanghai commercial guilds should build new houses suitable for theatrical performances, this kind of ornament would be adopted.\n\nWe also find in modern style a special development of the t'ing ts\u00fc. This first occurs in the sculptured halls of the Han dynasty. An ornamented roof rests on pillars. The pillars enclose a space which is open all round. We see it in the baldacchino of Romish cathedrals, in the kiosk of Constantinople, in the summer-house or arbour or bower of a pleasure-garden, and in the building over the stage of a Chinese theatre. The roof of a t'ing ts\u00fc may be very simple, as when made square with four slopes, or very complicated, as when gables and slopes alternate. Examples of rich variety in the roofing are seen in many theatres and in the corner towers of the Peking Palace wall.\n\nIn the Temple of Heaven the altar is carried to its highest point. Its circularity, its marble pavement and its numerical arrangement deserve attention. It is 90 feet wide at the top where the emperor kneels on the circular stone in the middle. He faces the north while kneeling, and in front of him is the tablet of Shang ti, the Supreme Ruler. Round the circular stone are eight concentric circles of marble stones. Nine stones make the first of these circles. Double that number form the next. Twenty-seven, thirty-six, forty-five, fifty-four stones form the next four circles. The three outer circles have sixty-three, seventy-two and eighty-one stones. These circles represent the universe, which consists of nine concentric spheres. This symbolism also occurred\nin Western Asia, and the city of Ecbatana, for example, was built on a plan which exhibits the same principle as its foundation. The marble stones on the middle and lower terrace of the altar are also placed in circles. Outside of them are the boundary-walls of the altar, which are also circular. The lower terrace is 210 feet wide and the middle one 150 feet. There are four flights of steps connecting the upper, middle and lower terraces. The altar is 16'95 feet high. When the emperor worships here, which he does twice a year, he acknowledges Shang ti as his superior, he himself representing the universe symbolized in the mystic numbers of this unique and beautifully-proportioned structure.\n\nWe also find bridges greatly improved in the modern style by adopting the arch. This came in with Buddhism, for we find it in the pagodas. At present it is used when it is desired to span rivers by bridges. Made with an arch for foot-passengers, such structures look well to the eye, but they are inconveniently steep, being often 30 feet in height. Such bridges are made with steps so that they are crossed easily by burden-bearing coolies. Beasts, however, cannot easily use them, which is a great defect. The appearance of these bridges is agreeable to the eye, and they last long, because the superincumbent weight is efficiently sustained in the most economical manner by the arch. Many bridges in modern style would be better for being not so steep as they are, and for not being made with steps. They ought to be built not only for longevity and elegant appearance, but for the convenience of traffic. The custom in China is for the rich to erect bridges and dams from charitable motives, and in order to obtain benefits in return from the unseen powers. The money is forthcoming, however much may be required, because of the charitable disposition of the donor. It might be, however, better used than it often is, and much greater convenience for the public\nsecured. There is often a want of economy in the expenditure. The Chinese are ready to give, and many of them are very rich, but they might give more wisely than they do.\n\nUltimately, in regard to railway construction in this country, the rich natives will bear a chief part of the burden. There is a large quantity of wealth in their hands. For this purpose, at present, they will not give as they would for a costly bridge. No one would praise them for it. They do not think that the unseen powers, that make men rich and give men many children and grandchildren, will favour the opening of railways as they do the construction in convenient spots of bridges and embankments. When they learn to feel this, and are convinced that the Buddhist doctrine of moral fate which influences their actions approves of railways, the money will come and come in abundance.\n\n*For Illustrations of Chinese Architecture the reader is referred to works containing plans, engravings and photographs. Among these may be mentioned Thomson's Views of China, the plates to Macartney's Embassy, P\u00e8re Zottoli's Cursus Litterature Sinica, Memoires concernant les Chinois, and various recent books of travel in China.\n\nThe number of photographs taken by natives is now so great that there is scarcely a remarkable building in any part of China of which a good photograph may not be obtained at Shanghai or elsewhere.\nNOTES ON THE NESTORIANS IN CHINA.\n\nBY E. H. PARKER.\n\nThe following notes may perhaps assist a little in elucidating several obscure points in connection with the Nestorians, Persians and Arabs living in China during the period A.D. 600 to A.D. 1200. It appears to me not unlikely that the Nestorian missionaries never reached the coast of China at all, and that their \"heresy\" was always tinged with the native superstitions of the Ugro-Tartars, through whose territory it filtered into China; also that it, and possibly other forms of early Christianity, were somewhat coloured by one or the other of the two leading forms of Buddhism; and that the lines of demarcation now drawn by dogma were not so rigid in those days as they are now; in short, that men were more tolerant.\n\n1.\u2014Were there ever Nestorians at Canton?\n\nThe late Mr. Bowra, in a paper upon the Christian Missions in Kwang Tung [China Review, Vol. II, Page 246] says that he could not satisfy himself that the Nestorians ever went to Canton.\n\nMr. Geo. Phillips quotes an extract from the Annals of the Canton Customs [China Review, Vol. VIII, Page 31] which makes mention of Persian Priests at Canton, in order to justify the identification of these priests with Nestorians. He confirms this supposition by citing a statement, found in\nRENAUDOT's translation of the Ancient Accounts of India and China, that there were many Christians residing at Canfa, which place Mr. Phillips inclines to think is Canton [I suppose \"Kwang-ju\"] because we can find no mention of Arab or Persian ships frequenting Hangchow at that time.\n\nThere are several extracts from a book called Ch'eng Shih [\u7a0b\u53f2, I suppose of the Sung dynasty] which shew that there were other foreign priests at Canton during the middle ages besides Persians. \"One of the most influential of the sea-foreigners [\u6d77\u7360] was one named P'au [\u84b2], known as the 'white barbarian,' who was originally a prominent man in Ciampa [\u5360\u57ce]. Having had rough weather on his voyage, he was afraid to go back, and begged his ruler for permission to remain in China so as to facilitate his trade.\" An extract from the Sung Shih says that most of the people at Ciampa are surnamed P'au; and another extract says that the Caliph Empire sent an envoy named P'au-sze-wu [\u84b2\u601d\u90a3]; all which looks as though Arab traders were meant in each case. Again: \"At Canton [\u756a\u79ba] there are sea-foreigners [\u6d77\u7360]: for praying happiness they have a hall; in the hall is a stone slab, which is the object of their symbolic worship [\u50cf\u4e3b], and those doing obeisance all turn towards it. They meet to eat at dawn, but do not provide spoons or chopsticks; they use gold and silver to make a great trough, and mix porpoise flesh, [\u9c91] vegetables, grain, and rice all together, sprinkling rose-water, and scattering camphor.\"\n\nThe word \u7360 is, as a rule, specially applied to the frontier tribes of Y\u00fcn Nan and Burmah, but that Arabs may have been included is evident, because the Sung Shih says of Ciampa, and also of Ta-li State [Y\u00fcn Nan]: \"Their customs and clothes are like those of the Caliph Empire,\" which last name is often grouped with those of other Indo-Chinese and Archipelago states, doubtless because the Arabs traded there.\nThe Chinese occasionally confuse the Persians with the Arabs. For instance, the T'ang Shu, on the subject of the Caliph Empire, says:\u2014\"Between the years A.D. 605-617 there was a Persian man tending herds at Medina [\u6469\u5730\u90a3]. Mountains in K\u016b-f\u00ean [\u4ff1\u7d1b]. A beast in the mountains said:\u2014\u2018East of the mountain, in the third cave, there is a sharp weapon, and a black stone with white writing on it; whoever gets it will rule.\u2019 He went, and found it so. The writing said he ought to rebel. He wheedled the people, and got together a multitude of desperate characters at the River Heng-ho [\u6052\u6613\u6c34]: robbed caravans, occupied the west part of the region, set himself up as king, removed the black stone, and treasured it. The people of the state went to chastise him, but were repulsed with great loss.\u201d\n\nThis, of course, is Mahomed, who was a tender of camels; who did spend time in a cave near Mecca; who framed his Koran with the aid of a Persian Jew and two Nestorians; who did hoax the people; took refuge in Medinn, and set up there (in the western part); whilst the black stone \u201cbrought by the angel Gabriel\u201d is still in the Caaba. The account of M\u00e9ht\u00e9hno State [\u9ed8\u5fb7\u90a3] given by Dr. Bretschneider on Page 177 of the China Review, Vol. V, confirms this strongly.\n\n2.\u2014Were the Ta-t\u00eah S\u00eang all Nestorians?\n\nIt is a question how far the expression Ta-t\u00eah S\u00eang [\u5927\u5fb7\u50e7] can be taken to refer to Nestorian missionaries. Mr. G. Phillips, criticising Dr. Bretschneider, has shewn [China Review, Vol. VII, Page 412] that, in or about the year A.D. 719, the ruler of Fu-h-lim [\u62c2\u83fb] sent two of these ecclesiastical dignitaries to the Chinese court with tribute; and he justly inclines to the view that these were Nestorian missionaries, inasmuch as Olopin, the introducer [A.D. 636] of Nestorian Christianity into China, is also described on the celebrated Si-an Fu monument as being a Ta-t\u00eah.\nDr. Hirth, in his work *China and the Roman Orient*, quotes the same passage, and also quotes a passage from the monument itself, which latter seems to mean that, in *Ta Ts'in* or *Fah-lim* Christianity is the only religion, and that Christians only can be rulers. [\u6cd5\u975e\u666f\u4e0d\u884c\uff1b\u4e3b\u975e\u5fb7\u4e0d\u7acb]; adding that Colonel Yule had already conjectured that the *Fah-lim* missions were connected with the Nestorian arrivals recorded on the monument, [Page 284 of the Identifications]. On the other hand, the old *Tsung Shu* tells us that, during the reign of Ming Huang [713-762], the King of Central India Ishuruma [\u4f0a\u6c99\u4f0f\u6469] sent his Ta-tch priest to court with tribute; and that, about that time [750], at one Chang Yih's suggestion, ten Ta-tch priests were banished to Ting-chou [south of Peking].\n\nAn extract from a work of Peh Kui [\u767d\u5c45\u6613, lived 772-846], on \"A Pagoda Slab of the Ta-tch Priests [\u5927\u5fb7\u548c\u50e7\u5854\u7891]\" says:\u2014\u201cAbstinence begets calm, calm begets \u201cwisdom, and wisdom has begotten 84,000 Fah-men [\u6cd5\u9580, \u201csectarians].\u201d It is evident that the Fah-men must have been different from the ordinary Buddhists, for the old *Tsung Shu* says:\u2014\u201cThe Emperor Wu of Liang was a devout \u201cBuddhist, whilst [his successor, A.D. 550] the Emperor \u201cKien Wen was an ardent Fah-men.\u201d\n\nThe Wen-kien Hen-lah [\u805e\u898b\u5f8c\u9304, apparently the same as, or a continuation of Wylie\u2019s Wen-kien Kin-lah, 11th century,] says that in Kyi-yang town of Feng-siang Fu, a piece of Buddha\u2019s bone lay buried under the pagoda of the Fah-men monastery, and that the Emperor Hien [806-823] had it brought with great ceremony into the palace, in spite of Hun Yu\u2019s remonstrances, [as to which remonstrance see *China Review*, Page 341 of Volume 1].\n\nThe *Tu-yang Tsah-pien* [\u675c\u967d\u96dc\u7de8, 9th century] says that \u201cin the spring of the year A.D. 873 an imperial order \u201ccommanded the Ta-tch priests to go and welcome Buddha\u2019s\nbone. On the 8th day of the 4th moon, it was brought into \"Ch'ang-an [Si-an Fu]: the Emperor sat in the An-fuh Monastery [\u5b89\u798f] and personally kowtowed to it.\" Another passage says that \"several hundred Ta-t\u00eah priests were ordered to welcome the Buddha's bone of the Fah-m\u00ean monastery of Feng-siang Fu.\"\n\n3.\u2014Were all Fah-m\u00ean Buddhists?\n\nA work called the Wu Ting Hwei-y\u00fcn [\u4e94\u71c8\u6703\u5143] says that the first Buddhist apostle in China [\u6771\u571f] was the Worshipful Dharma [\u9054\u6469\u5c0a\u8005] who was also the last of the line of 28 in India [\u897f\u5929]. He was the son of Huang-y\u00fceh [\u9999\u7389], king of Southern India; and in the year A.D. 520 he came to China by the southern sea route, and stayed at a temple called the Shuo-lin Sz [\u5c11\u6797\u5bfa]. This man must not be confused with another Dharma, a painter, who came by land to Sz Chnam in 580-605. His name was \u9054\u6469\u64ab\u7236.\n\nThe Kua Seng Chuan [\u9ad8\u50e7\u50b3, a 6th century work], says that his successor was one Hwei Ku [\u6167\u53ef], who stood in the snow and cut off his arm whilst begging inspiration from Dharma. Dharma said:\u2014\"My religion is in the heart, and ignores written script: apostles must be bound by the heart.\" Hence the saying 'stamp in the heart.'\" The old T'ung Shu gives the same account of Dharma as that above; and the Sung Shih says that Hwei-ko brought out a work on the human pulse by Dharma. A work called the (Chuan-fuh) Cheng-tsung Ki [(\u50b3\u6cd5\u6b63\u5b97\u8a18] says that the third apostle [\u4e09\u7956] was the priest Ts'au [\u50e7\u74a8\u5927\u5e2b], but that nothing is known of his origin, except that he came from the Northern Ts'i [Tungusie Empire 550-580], and lived in seclusion at the Kuh-shan Temple [\u8c37\u5c71\u5bfa] of Kuang Shan [\u516c\u5c71] in modern An Hwei Province. The fourth apostle was Tao-sin [\u9053\u4fe1\u5927\u5e2b], whose real surname was Sz-ma [\u53f8\u99ac]. He was reembodied in the person of Hung-jen [\u5f18\u5fcd\u5927\u5e2b], a\nnative of Huang-mei [\u9ec4\u6885] in modern Hu Pei Province. Both of them were together at a temple on Po-tou Shan [\u9817\u982d\u5c71] in A.D. 624. The Wu-teng Hwei-yuan says that the bronze Shen-siu [\u795e\u79c0] associated with Confucian scholars in his youth, and picked up a great deal of knowledge; suddenly he became a priest and entered the Tung-shan [\u6771\u5c71\u5bfa] temple, where he met the fifth apostle Hung-jen, and acknowledged with joy, that he had at last found a real master. Finally, the \"History of the Priest Shen-siu\" says that Tao-siu and Hung-jen went together to the Tung-shan monastery, and that their religion was called the Tung-shan Fah-men; Shen-siu looked up to Hung-jen, who therefore thought very highly of him.\n\nA literary effort [\u8056\u6559\u5e8f] of the T'ang Emperor T'ai Tsung [627-650] describes the celebrated traveller Hsia Ch'uang as a Leader of the Fah-men [\u6cd5\u9580\u4e4b\u9818\u8896].\n\nI.\u2014Does the Word Tien belong to Nestorianism alone?\n\nThe Sui Shu [5th century] says, in connection with the state of Kang [\u5eb7], (which has been abundantly proved to be identical with Samarcand):\u2014\"They have a body of Turkish law [\u80e1\u5f8b], which is placed in the Nestorian temple [\u7946\u7960]; and, when any punishment is to be awarded, they take and decide it by this.\" In translating the remarks of the Ming Shu, written nearly a thousand years later, upon Samarcand [\u6492\u99ac\u5152\u7f55], Dr. Bretschneider [China Review, Vol. V, Page 127] shows that, in the fourteenth century, there was still a hall there, in which the sacred book (then, of course, Moslem), was explained. And that this Nestorian body of law had found its way into China previous to the year A.D. 800 is evident from the remark made by the poet Pi Jih-hiu [\u76ae\u65e5\u4f11, T'ang dynasty] that there was a \u80e1\u5f8b in the Wu-k'iu Temple [\u6b66\u4e18\u5bfa], somewhere in China.\nThat the Turkish races had Nestorian temples among them, previous to their conversion to Moslem, seems plain from the following extract from the Yu-yang Tsah-tsu, [\u9149\u967d\u96dc\u4fce] a work of the eighth century: The Turks [\u7a81\u53a5], in worshipping God [\u795e], have no temples or shrines [\u7960\u5edf]. They carve sandal into figures, which they put in skin bags, and wherever they go, they smear them over with an unguent [\u8102\u8607], sometimes lashing them on to a stake; and they sacrifice to them [\u7940\u4e4b] at the four seasons.\n\nThe Si K'ei Tsung Yu says:\u2014\"In the fifth year of Cheng-kwan [A.D. 631] imperial orders were given for the construction of a Nestorian temple [\u7946\u5bfa] in the Ch'ung-hou division [\u5d07\u5316\u574a] of Chang-an; and it was called the Syrian [\u5927\u79e6] or Persian [\u6ce2\u65af] temple [\u5bfa].\" Again: \"The Emperor Wu Tsung [841-6] destroyed the Buddhist temples, and made the priests commoners. In A.D. 845 he ordered the Syrian Archimandrite and sixty others [\u5927\u79e6\u7a46\u8b77\u5927\u7946\u7b49] to revert to the lay status.\"*\n\n* The last two extracts are taken from the Si-ki Tsung-Yu [\u897f\u8c3f\u53e2\u8a9e] a work which, according to Wylie's Notes on Chinese Literature, was written by Yao K'wan [\u59da\u5bec] in the 12th century, and partly or wholly republished during the Ming dynasty, in an encyclopaedic collection known as the Pai Hai [\u7a17\u6d77].\n\nAn extract from the Hwei-chu Luh [\u63ee\u9e88\u9304], however, states that the Si-ki Tsan-yu [\u897f\u8c3f\u6b98\u8a9e] was compiled at Yao K'wan's direction by [some one whose personal name was] Wei \u5a01, and that it was a very complete collection of notes on ancient and modern things.\n\nThis leaves us pretty much where we were, as Wylie does not seem to mention the Hwei-chu Luh at all. But an extract from the Tsung K'ao [\u901a\u8003] informs us that the latter work was compiled by one Wang Ming-tsing [\u738b\u660e\u6e05], son of Wang Chih [\u738b\u9298] who, according to Wylie, wrote in the 12th century.\n\nIt is clear therefore that the two authorities or the one, if both be identical, date from the twelfth century A.D.\nWere all Post-Priests Nestorians?\n\nAn extract from the old Tsang Shu says that, during the reign A.D. 806-821, the Uighurs successfully applied for leave to establish Mani [\u6469\u5c3c] temples in Ho-nan Fu and Tai-yuan Fu; and the Kang Kien gives the year A.D. 806 as the date of the first introduction of Mani sectarians, who are described as being Uighur subjects, but Buddhists and Taoists by religion [\u6d6e\u5c60\u9053\u4eba\u4e4b\u7a31]. Another extract from the Sung Shu says that, in the state of Kao Ch'ang [\u9ad8\u660c], during the period 960-1127 the Uighur metropolis, there was a Mani temple where the Persian priests [\u6ce2\u65af\u50e7] held their separate rites; they were the so-called \"heretics\" [\u5916\u9053] of the Buddhist Sutras.\n\nA work called the T'ien-kouan Sha-chu [\u5929\u5b98\u66f8\u6ce8, the date of which I cannot find], says that \"the Great Unity\" [\u6cf0\u4e00] is the most worshipful God of Heaven,\" to which a commentator adds, [\u9577\u6c34\u758f]: \"the custom of all Western nations is to worship the Eternal God of Heaven [\u9577\u547d\u5929\u795e].\"\n\nThe Fa-hsiian Chu-lin [\u6cd5\u82d1\u73e0\u6797] says that there was a very learned polemical Brahman in the Lion state [Ceylon], champion of the Wai-tao [\u5916\u9053], who, hearing that Kumarajiva was preaching Buddhism in North-west China, [\u95dc\u4e2d, and at the Toba court, 397-415], got on a camel with his books, and came to Chang-an. The Tsun Shu says that Kumarajiva's mother had been with the King of Kuche [\u9f9c\u5179], and that she went with her son to India, and tried to dissuade him from preaching in China. Also that \"his father was a clever and virtuous man, and had declined the hereditary premiership, crossed the Orion Range, and come east.\" From these extracts it would seem that Kumarajiva was not a Hindoo, but a Kuche Turk.\nG.\u2014What other Religions, besides Nestorianism and probably Zoroasterism, flourished in the Uigur and North-west China Region?\n\nThe Turkish races, and the Uigurs especially, seem to have been religiously inclined, and tolerant to all religion, for the *Sung Moh Ki-wen* [\u677e\u6f22\u7d00\u805e, a 12th century history of the Xuchens], says:\u2014The Uigurs are very devout Buddhists; when they worship, they wear the Kach\u0101ya, and use the Sanskrit or Hindoo tongue. [\u4f5c\u897f\u7afa\u8a9e]. The *Sung Shih* says of Kuo Ch'ang: There are over 50 Buddhist monasteries, all with door-slabs presented by the T'ung dynasty: in their monasteries they have several Chinese dictionaries and other works [\u5510\u97fb, \u7389\u7bc7\u7d93\u97f3, etc.].\n\nThe *Si-hu Chi-y\u00fc* [\u897f\u6e56\u5fd7\u9918, possibly the same as the *Si-hu Ch'tsuan* \u7bc7 of Wylie, 18th century] says that \"wax-\" fasting is a custom under which barbarian priests of the \"Western regions, during fast time, weigh their bodies and \"make a wax figure of like weight: when the fast is over, \"they again weigh themselves, and, if their bodies are heavier \"than the wax, they have been good: if lighter, then their \"efforts have failed.\"\n\nThe *Fah-yuan Chu-lin* [\u6cd5\u82d1\u73e0\u6797, 7th century] says:\u2014\n\n\"The Sutras [\u7d93] in the West are all written in characters \"derived from Sanskrit [\u7956\u68b5], but some of the 36 states \"use forms of it very different from others.\" The word for Sanskrit is loosely used, for we find Pushpa, the Tibetan preceptor of Kublai described in the *Tuan Shih* as a \u68b5\u50e7, whilst the *Liao Shih*, or Kitau History, says that in A.D. 1001 a \"Sanskrit priest\" and distinguished physician was introduced to court by the Uigurs.\n\nThe *Meng-kei Pih-tan*, [\u5922\u6eaa\u7b46\u8ac7, a very good authority of the 11th century], says that in the *Yen-chou* [\u5ef6\u5dde] hills\nthere is a Buddhist temple of the Ts'in state [\u79e6\u570b\u4f5b\u5bfa,\nprobably referring to the Tibetan Ts'in dynasty of Yao \u59da\n(384-417), which succeeded the Tibetan Ts'in dynasty of\nP'u or Fu, \u6fee\u6216\u7b26 (351-395), both in North-west China,\nand also in relation with the Cashmir Buddhists], in the\ncourt of which is King S\u012br\u012bs [\u5c38\u6bd7] grave.\n\n7.\u2014Is there any Evidence that any Foreign Priests ever\nwent to Canton? Were not the \"Sea-foreigners\"\nprobably mere Traders, going through their Daily\nReligious Observances?\n\nThe Yih T'ung Chi [\u4e00\u7d71\u5fd7, I suppose the Yilan dynasty\nedition.] says that south-east of Shao Chou [that is,\nsomewhere on the Canton coast] there is a port called\nTs'ao K'i [\u66f9\u6eaa], to which, during the Liang dynasty [A.D.\n502-555], a Hindoo priest came in a merchant ship. This\nstatement is confirmed by an extract from a stone tablet\nof the 8th century in praise of one Ma Tsung's [\u99ac\u7e3d]\nadministration at Ts'ao K'i, saying:\u2014\"The great barbarian\nships from Aumam, and the Western sea-going craft from\nIndia [\u8eab\u7be4] all shared in his kindness.\" Another\npanegyric of the same date, on the same man, speaks of the\nvaluable freights [\u5bf6\u8236] he induced. The T'ang Shu speaks\nof Pulo Condor ships [\u8993\u96c0\u8236] at Canton in the Empress\nWu's time [684-704], and of an affray with the captain of\none of them, in connection with some extortion, and says that,\nduring the tenure of office of the 38th descendant of\nConfucius there, [A.D. 808], the mooring-dues exacted from\nbarbarian ships were abolished. There had been great\ncorruption after the reign 714-742. An undated inscription\nspeaks of a sort of Hoppo at Canton called the \u62bc\u756a\u8236\u4f7f.\nThe poet Tu Fu [\u675c\u752b 812-870] sings of \"thousands of\nSea-Turk ships\" [\u6d77\u80e1\u8236], which probably refers to the\nArab traders. The *T'ung Shu* says that Wei Ch'eng-kwan [\u97cb\u6b63\u8cab], nephew of [the famous Tibetan frontier administrator] Wei Kuo [\u97cb\u768b, 9th century], \"was appointed Imperial Commissioner at Canton [\u5dba\u5357\u7bc0\u5ea6\u4f7f]. The maritime traders had hitherto been obliged to give the first pick of their ivory, pearls, etc., to the great officers [\u5927\u5e25] at nominal prices; but after his arrival there was no such demand made, and his understrappers grumbled at his integrity.\" Again:\u2014\"During the Emperor King's reign [about A.D. 825] the maritime traders offered gara wood and timber for building pavilions [\u4ead\u6750].\" The *Wu Tai Shih* says that Liu Chuang [\u5289\u93de, Emperor of the Southern Han dynasty reigning at Canton, about A.D. 970], \"was dallying with his palace girls and Persian [\u6ce2\u65af] women in the inner apartments, and left the government of his state to the ministers.\" The *T'ung-kwoh Shih-pu* [\u5510\u570b\u53f2\u88dc, doubtless of the T'ang dynasty] says that the Lion state's [Ceylon] ships were the largest that came to Canton [\u5357\u6d77], and that, on their arrival filled with precious goods, the Governor at once reported the fact to the Emperor.\n\n8.\u2014Is there not Evidence of Early Foreign Sea-Trade with Fu Kien and Cheh Kiang Ports as well?\n\nA. The *Peh Shih* [7th century] says that Loochoo is five days' sail from Kien-an [\u5efa\u5b89 modern Foochow]. The *Ch'ung-hing Hwei-yao* [\u4e2d\u8208\u6703\u8981, Southern Sung.] says that, during the reign 1131\u20131163, the Emperor was alive to the importance of encouraging barbarian ships by having an honest officer at Foochow.\n\nB. The *Wu-kwoh Ku-shih* [\u4e94\u570b\u6545\u4e8b, 10th century] says that one Wang Yen-pin was appointed to Ts'utan-chou, and used to successfully freight a barbarian ship every good year. The *Yuan Shih* [Mongol] mentions the appointment of\none Kwei-kwei to watch the ships at Ts'ien-chou [\u6cc9\u8236]. See the late Mr. Mayers' remarks on page 185 of Vol. IV. of the China Review. The same work says that junks from Ts'ien-nan [\u6cc9\u5357] pass Champa on their way to Java. The Wen-hien Tung-kao says the largest ships that came to China were of one thousand boran [\u5a46\u862d] capacity, with only one mast; each boran was 300 pounds [400 lbs., or.] Boran is evidently a foreign word, but it does not appear to what port these large ships came.\n\nC. The I-y\u00fcan [\u7570\u82d1, quare date.] says: During the reign 826-837, during the building of a granary at Shau-yin [opposite Hangchow] two large boats were dug up, and in them were found coins with characters on the rim. Ouyang Sin [\u6b50\u967d\u4fee 11th century] says: \"Hangchow, [\u9322\u5858] ever since 'the Five Dynasties [10th century], has had the good sense to \"obey China [proper], to respectfully ask commands, and to \"cease warring. The people are now rich and happy, and the \"town is splendidly built, having a population of over 100,000 \"families, and being shut in between the lake and the mountains. \"Fuh Kien traders and all sorts of sea-going ships crowd the \"harbour.\" The Wu-tai Shu says that \"Ts'ien Liu of Wu-Yueh, [\u5433\u8d8a\u9322\u93d0, independently ruling at Hangchow A.D. 900], \"frequently sent envoys across the sea, and all the sea-ports \"did a large trade with his people.\" The \"good sense\" evidently alludes to the period subsequent to his reign.\n\nD. The Ming Yih-Tung Chi [\u660e\u4e00\u7d71\u5fd7] says that Chapiu [\u4e4d\u6d66 near Hangchow] is in the Ping-hu district [\u5e73\u6e56], and that, during the Yuan [Mongol] time, foreign ships congregated there. The same work says that \"Canfu [\u6f89\u6d66]\" was in the Hoi-yen district of Ka-hing Fu; and that, during \"the reign of Kublai Khan, it was a great resort for traders, \"for which reason the Ming dynasty built a wall round the \"harbour, and gave to the place the name of Kan-pen Mart.\" The city of Hai-yen was near the old Salt Town [\u9e7d\u5b98\u93ae].\nwhich had been two centuries earlier submerged by the inroads of the sea. The Sh\u00ean Pao reported that valuable porcelains were dug up here in 1887 when part of the old town was exposed to view.\n\nThe result of the above quotations, all of which are taken from the Pei-w\u00ean Yin-ju, seems to me to be as follows:\n\n1. There is no evidence that any Nestorians ever were at Canton, or that any Persian Christians ever were there.\n\n2. Nor that Canton was Canfu, or that Canfu was any other place than Kan-pu.\n\n3. There is plenty of evidence that both Persians and Arabs went to Canton; and it seems likely that they were also among the foreigners who plainly went in ships to Fuh Kien and Ch\u00eah Kiang ports.\n\n4. The term Ta-t\u00eah S\u00eang was undoubtedly applied to Nestorians, and to their religion the king kiao [\u666f\u6559]: but the term Ta-t\u00eah S\u00eang was also applied to the Fah-m\u00ean priests, and to priests from India.\n\n5. If all the Fah-m\u00ean were not Buddhists, at least some of them were. It is certain that some Fah-m\u00ean were Buddhist sectaries of some sort, and there is nothing to shew that all were not.\n\n6. The Wai-tao were not orthodox Buddhists, and there is nothing to shew that any of them were Buddhists at all. Some of them were Po-sz and Moni priests.\n\n7. Ta Ts'in is not only identical with Fah-lin in the sense of \"Syria,\" but, in connection with ecclesiastical matters only, it is interchanged also with Po-sz. It seems not unlikely that Po-sz and Persian both mean \"Parsee\" in many cases, both in China and in the West.\n\n8. The word tien [\u5929, or Heaven as a spiritual abstraction] cannot be shewn to have been applied exclusively to Nestorians.\n9. Po-sz priests were in some cases identical with Moni priests; in others with Syrian Nestorians.\n\n10. The Arabs traded all along the China coast as far as they found ports.\nTHE \"TENT THEORY\" OF CHINESE ARCHITECTURE.\n\nBY S. RITTER VON FRIES.\n\nWhen reading the proceedings of the meeting of the Royal Asiatic Society on the 21st February, as published in the North-China Herald, I noticed that Mr. Carles, one of the members present, in commenting on Dr. Edkins' paper on \"Chinese Architecture,\" expressed his surprise that the learned author had made slight reference to the Tent Theory, and even doubted whether it was a tenable hypothesis that the curved roofs of Chinese buildings had developed out of and were a remnant of ancient tent-habitations.\n\nIn regard to the theory, I venture\u2014though a layman in matters of architecture\u2014to express my view, hoping to elicit in this way information from some of the learned members of our Society who have entered into this question, and arrived perhaps already at a definite result, either supporting or upsetting my argument.\n\nMy conviction is, and I hope to be able to prove it, that Dr. Edkins was perfectly correct in abandoning a hypothesis which cannot be upheld substantially. The few \"proofs\" which Mr. Carles brings forward, I find, are as little an obstacle to discarding the tent theory as they are a support of the same.\n\nIf we are to assume that the shape of the tent was so familiar to the Chinese that they continued to preserve the same even in their structures of masonry, we must in the first place be able to show that the dwellings of the natives ever consisted of tents. In which period of the history of\nthis people, wonderfully complete as it is, do we find a hint of their having lived in tents? If we go so far back as to the mythical sovereigns Yu Chiao (\u6709\u5de2) and Huang Ti (\u9ec3\u5e1d), we read that they taught the people to build houses and cities. Of course this is myth; but would even myth abstain from mentioning the existence of tents altogether, if they had been the first and usual form of their quarters at any time? The Chinese fully realise the fact that a nation in its childhood is uncivilised, and they are not ashamed to relate that their ancestors \"ate hairs and drank blood,\" before some one of the Shui-j\u00ean family (\u71e7\u4eba\u6c0f) discovered fire. Why, then, should they ignore the tents, which they would doubtless have kept longer than that strange food and beverage, especially if we find it reasonably assumable that this form of dwelling had any influence on their architecture. I have nowhere come across a passage yet which would show that the Chinese were formerly in the habit of making use of these portable structures as constant habitations. In the absence of such a passage, I must also put the question: were the Chinese ever a nomadic tribe, so as to require tents, or so as to be in circumstances to find them useful? As far as I am aware, the Chinese neither consider themselves, nor are they by Western historians described, as nomads. We have every reason to believe that they were as early as possible a settled people, and essentially agriculturists, (note Sh\u00ean-nung, the divine husbandman) a mode of life which in itself excludes migration. In the face of these facts, we should, I should say, require very strong proofs to believe that the Chinese were, instead of cave and hut dwellers, at any time dwellers in tents. That tents have been employed by them on their numerous warlike expeditions, even in remote antiquity, I am quite willing to concede, as they could have learned their usefulness in such cases from their northern nomadic neighbours.\nThe next point in favour of my argument is etymological. Do any of the characters, or part of them, which bear the signification of house, dwelling, home, etc., have the slightest reference to a tent-like structure? Do not the radicals \u623f (mien) and \u5c4b (hu) unmistakably point to both a cave and a dwelling with doors, indicating surely that a tent cannot be meant? Finally, the expression chang-tang, meaning a tent, is a composition, and therefore naturally also of more recent invention.\n\nIf it is not possible to adduce proofs in either history or language in support of the tent theory, by what circumstances then, I may be allowed to ask, are we forced to assume, in spite of this significant silence, that the shape of the tent is the cause of the characteristic form and arrangement of Chinese buildings? The singularly curved roof, I am told, is such a prima facie proof. I venture not only to disbelieve that the usual Chinese roof has derived its shape from the tent, but to go farther, maintaining that such a curve has scarcely anything in it parallel to a tent at all. The outlines of the latter are necessarily straight, and it is the space between the framework, covered with cloth, skins, and the like material, which would bend and show a curve, and this again principally with tents having a triangular profile, which are the sort least likely to have been used. The yurt which the Tartars, Kirghese, and Kalmyks construct is round and often hemispherical, and bears no resemblance whatever to the Chinese house. The surface of the roof of native houses is not bent, but the masonry or beams at both its ends, also sometimes the ridge of the house, show the typical curve. The roof surface, on the contrary, is perfectly even and bears, especially in the South, obvious traces of split bamboo roofing alternately showing the concave and convex, the convex parts swelling upwards like ribs, which form it has been found useful to follow even in tile roofs. It is therefore\nevident to me that the Chinese house of the present age originated from caves and huts, and the apparently puzzling flourish of corners and ridge of the roof of buildings can, if it must be derived, just as well have been caused by the uneven forms of the rude material used to build the primeval hut. I am, however, more of the opinion that this peculiarly shaped line was no inheritance of days of yore, but is an artistic embellishment given to the gradually more improved houses and temples. That wooden buildings apparently induce the constructor to add projections to the roof and increase its ornamentation I find illustrated in the primitive houses of peasants in some parts of the Austrian Alps, where the wide outstretched rafters at the corners are very often decorated with fantastic carvings, and those on the long side of the roof are bent upwards, and are utilised at the same time to support the eaves. Most of the Chinese ornamentation, which Dr. Enckens rightly asserts ought to be considered Buddhist, is incongruent with that indigenous fondness for the rectangle which is exhibited in their architecture, furniture and dress, and I can therefore not suppress my doubt whether the characteristically curved roof is originally Chinese. There is, I am perfectly aware, neither in India nor anywhere else an exact parallel to it to be found, which we might consider the original of that form, and I consequently express my doubts with reservation. The archaeological remains of Egypt, the country which seemingly had the same propensity for a geometrical arrangement as China, show uniformity in every branch of the plastic arts, because they are all equally Egyptian.\n\nIn concluding, I solicit a renewed attention on the part of the learned members of the Society to this interesting question.\nNOTE ON THE COMPARATIVE LONGEVITY OF MALES AND FEMALES IN JAPAN.\n\nBY T. E. HALLIFAX.\n\nThe appended list, taken from the census report published in March 1890, may be of some little interest, as showing the greater longevity of females over that of males in Japan, and the impunity with which the Japanese inhale both tobacco and charcoal fumes. It is the universal custom in Japanese houses during autumn, winter and spring to warm the rooms with charcoal fires. These of themselves would not prove very harmful, as the houses are so badly constructed as to admit draughts from all sides, and thereby render the fumes comparatively innocuous; but the people, both men and women, have a habit of sitting close to the fire with their heads leaning over, so as to inhale fumes to such an extent as would speedily knock over a European. Again, both sexes are inveterate smokers, and inhale all the tobacco smoke. Of course many people of Europe inhale tobacco smoke, but they do not inhale charcoal fumes also; and it is rather matter for surprise that any Japanese reach a hundred, seeing that a great part of their lives they are inhaling poisonous matter, thereby diminishing in the same proportion the necessary supply of oxygen. Among my own acquaintance are several old women, nearer eighty than seventy, who are inveterate smokers, and who, during three-fourths\nof the year, crouch over the charcoal fire, yet who are still remarkably healthy and active.\n\n| AGE | Male and Female |\n|-----|----------------|\n| 70  | 983,856        |\n| 80  | 199,074        |\n| 90  | 7,507          |\n| 101 | Males 9, Females 21 |\n| 102 | \" nil \" 9      |\n| 103 | \" 1 \" 2        |\n| 104 | \" 4 \" 18       |\n| 105 | \" 3 \" 6        |\n| 106 | \" 1 \" 1        |\n| 107 | \" nil \" 1      |\nPROCEEDINGS.\n\nMinutes of a General Meeting held in the Society's Library,\nMuseum Road, Shanghai, on Friday, 21st February 1890, at 9 p.m.\n\nMr. P. J. Hughes (President) occupied the chair. There were about 30 persons present.\n\nThe Hon. Secretary (Mr. W. Bright), in opening the proceedings, said that as the business of the last meeting of the Society, held on the 20th December, had been fully reported in the daily newspapers, he thought that, with the permission of those present, the minutes might be taken as read. At the last meeting the President had mentioned that the abstract of the replies to the Weights, Measures, and Currency circular was in course of preparation by Mr. Morse. It was now his duty to report to the meeting that the abstract had been received, and would form a valuable addition to the current fascicle of the Society's Journal, which was shortly to be published. The thanks of the Society were due to their correspondents for their replies, and especially to Mr. Morse for the great pains he had bestowed on the preparation of the summary. The Circular for 1890 on \"Inland Communications\" had just been issued, and would, he hoped, elicit even more numerous and exhaustive replies than resulted from the issue of the last Circular. The information sought on the present occasion to be obtained from all parts of China and Corea had reference to the main roads, the condition of the ancient and modern roads, particulars of noteworthy bridges, viaducts and tunnels, of modes of conveyance, rate and cost of travelling, cost of carriage of goods, and accommodation for travellers. He might add, in conclusion, that, owing to the difficulty experienced in some cases of obtaining subscriptions from members, the Council had decided to remove from the list the names of those\nwho had failed to pay their subscriptions for the past three years, and\nto print in the next fascicule of the Journal a notice to the effect that\nmembers whose subscriptions were a year in arrear would receive no\nfurther publications of the Society.\n\nThe President said that he had much pleasure in announcing the\nelection, since the last meeting of the Society, of the following gentle-\nmen: Messrs. Max Goebel (Consul-General for Belgium), F. M.\nGuatton and Ferd. Rinkel. In the name of the Society, he desired\nto thank M. Janet for his kindness in arranging and classifying the\nspecimens of butterflies in the Museum. He had been requested to\nintimate to members that they would greatly assist their indefatigable\nHon. Librarian (Dr. Faber), in his arduous labour of re-arranging\nthe books in the Library, if they would kindly return without delay\nany works which might happen to be in their possession. There were\nat present some forty books missing; the absence of such was, to say\nthe least, exceedingly inconvenient. The lecture on \"Chinese\nArchitecture,\" which they were to have the pleasure of hearing from\nDr. Edkins that evening, would, he was informed, treat the subject\nfrom the historical point of view. The well-known learning and\nability of the lecturer entitled them to expect a lecture of more than\nordinary interest, and he was glad to see many present, though\ndoubtless there would have been a much larger audience had not the\nweather been so severe. Among those present he noticed some who\nhad travelled extensively in the interior, and who had doubtless come\nacross remains of ancient edifices and seen the cave and rock dwellings\ndescribed by Dr. Williamson in his interesting work, Journeys in\nNorth China. There were other gentlemen\u2014and perhaps ladies, too\u2014\nwho, although they had not gone so far afield, had closely observed\nthe facts within their reach, and who might possibly favour the meeting\nwith the results of their observations. Last, and perhaps not least,\nthere were present professional gentlemen able, as he hoped they would\nbe willing, to tell them something about Chinese architecture regarded\nfrom the standpoint of Western science. He had no doubt that thus\nmany novel and interesting facts would be elicited, and a flood of light\nthrown upon a subject which, as far as he knew, had not hitherto been\ndiscussed at a meeting of the Society.\nDr. J. Edkins then read extracts from his paper on \"Chinese Architecture,\" which is printed in extenso pp. 253 seq. of this volume.\n\nIn the discussion which followed,\n\nGeneral Mesny thought that the different interpretations of scholars in regard to the caves and kilns arose from the use of the same character to express both, as was the case in Shansi and Kansu, though in Szechuan the caves were known by a distinct name. The loess referred to by the lecturer resembled chalk, was easily worked, and was used for making cabins, beds, stoves, etc. The ornaments which he had noticed round the graves of Emperors were usually in pairs; there were two torches, two goats, two horses, two men, and so on. The graves had large tablets, with inscriptions similar to those on tombstones in Western countries. The cap (or mao-tzu) at the top of the tablets had designs of dragons holding balls\u2014presumably of fire. There were caves of the Tang dynasty ten or so miles west of Honan-fu executed out of solid rock, and many of them very large. Excepting the porcelain pagoda at Nanking, the pagodas he had seen were mostly of brick.\n\nDr. Faber said that he had followed with much interest the valuable paper of Dr. Edkins, and only regretted that he found it impossible to remember the great number of minor details. He wished to ask the lecturer a question, namely, \"What was the characteristic feature of Chinese architecture?\"\u2014in the sense that we speak of parallel lines forming the characteristic of Greek architecture, of the vertical line with pointed arch of Gothic, and of the round arch of the Roman style.\n\nDr. Edkins replied that he considered the roof the characteristic feature of Chinese architecture.\n\nDr. Faber, continuing, said that the roof was certainly very characteristic of Chinese architecture. Architecture, however, was not merely workmanship, but a science and an art. The roof could not be considered as an object in itself, but only in connexion with the building to which it belonged, and of which, as an organic whole, it must be a part. Herein Chinese architecture was deficient. The ground plan was sometimes well proportioned, but the leading from it to the superficial roof was seldom perfect, except, perhaps, in small\nopen garden-houses, in which the Chinese excel. Though the roof was not exclusively supported by walls, but by pillars also, the pillars in themselves showed no artistic perfection. They had commonly a pedestal, of which there were various forms in China, but no capital. Only very rarely was a rough beginning of such to be seen in China. The upper portion of the pillar was pierced by cross-pieces, commonly of wood. This piercing pointed to wood-construction as another feature of Chinese architecture. For this reason no vaults were to be met with, the very few exceptions, on the Omei Mountain and in graves, pointing to foreign workmanship. Dr. Edkins had mentioned a building entirely of stone; it would be interesting to get more particulars about such. Then with regard to the Ming-t'ang, they had been told that it was a square building with a round roof. To accomplish that in an artistic way, to the satisfaction of cultivated, aesthetic ideas, meant the highest perfection in architecture. It would mean an anticipation of Michael Angelo and Wren, 3,000 years ago. But we might as well believe in the squaring of the circle by the Chinese. Probably a round roof was simply put on a square one.\n\nThat the Ming-t'ang, at the Tai Mountain, was more magnificent than other buildings of the kind was due to the near relationship of the Duke of Lu, commonly called Chow Kung, to the Imperial house of the Chow, and to his great merits in establishing that dynasty in China. He was invested with the feudal State of Lu, and special privileges were granted to him. Some of these referred to the Ming-t'ang. This was a large building for ancestral worship, for audiences, and for the reception of the Emperor on his tours of inspection. There were four other buildings of the kind in China at the time, the principal one being at the Imperial residence. In the Li-ki they were told that the Emperors of the Shang and Hsia dynasties had similar buildings under other names. Though that kind of building served for religious as well as for political purposes, it did not follow that all ancient Chinese buildings were devoted to religious observances. There were very early notices in Chinese literature of markets, of walled cities, of granaries and other store-houses, of stables, towers, etc. All such buildings were doubtless very prosaic in outline, only serving for the immediate necessities of life. The designs of all\nlarger buildings in China exhibit an immense waste of space; the principal impression was received from the vast dimensions, which, according to Burke, are always the sign of a common and low imagination. Of more or less beauty, however, were the gates and gateways, and, as a branch of them, the memorial arches. Their ornamentation was often beautiful. But even in their ornamentation the Chinese rarely, if ever, exhibited congruity of detail. The details were often perfect, but they were seldom in such full harmony with other details as to present to the spectator the pleasing aspect of a harmonious work of art. The distinction of a classical and post-classical period in Chinese architecture was scarcely tenable, and certainly of but little importance. Very marked, however, was the Buddhistic period. No mention had been made of the influence of Mohammedan architecture in China. There was undoubtedly such from Arabia (for example, in Canton), from Persia, and from Turkestan. It was possible that the superiority of the architecture of the Ming dynasty could be traced to that source.\n\nDr. Williams said there were comparatively few allusions to the buildings of the Chinese in ancient books, and it would be easier to describe their dresses than their dwellings. The few which existed had been utilised by Dr. Evers. There was no doubt that the lecturer was right in saying that the first end was geometrical, and this was also true of contemporaneous architecture. The early Babylonian and Assyrian architecture was emphatically geometrical\u2014usually rectangular\u2014crowned often with a dome or an octagon; so also with the earliest Egyptian. The Great Pyramid was a geometrical problem from base to apex. And in regard to these the lecturer was also right in saying that science preceded superstition. Those two styles of architecture seemed to have had no beginning, but to have sprung up in their richest glory like Minerva full grown and armed from the brain of Jupiter. This was true likewise of the most ancient Egyptian statues, alike as regards size, expression, and finish. In regard to the second stage, the speaker thought it was very likely that Ts'in Shi Huang had obtained his ideas of parks and gardens and other of his public works from the royal palaces of Babylonia, which appeared so unexpectedly\nin China, as with the touch of a magician's wand. Tsin Shi Hwang lived in the distant north-west, and there could be no doubt that there was far more intercourse in those times between Central Asia and Asia Minor than was once supposed.\n\nMr. Hughes (the President) suggested that the resemblance between the Chinese house and the Mongol tent might account for the style of Chinese buildings. He had not heard that subject referred to in the course of the discussion, and perhaps there were some present who could enlighten them with regard to it.\n\nDr. Edkins stated that he knew that that was a favourite theory, but he had not much faith in it.\n\nGeneral Messy having made a brief reference to the resemblance between the portable canopy used at military reviews, to shelter the inspecting officer, and the concave roofs met with in China,\n\nMr. Charles said that he was rather surprised to hear the learned lecturer call in question the origin of Chinese architecture. It was not only the outer slope of the roof in a Chinese house which bore a resemblance to a tent; there were many other features in common. In building it, the wooden framework was first placed in position, after which the brickwork was filled in, the sequence of work being the same as that with a tent's pole and its covering. Further, the rafters overlapped the pillars to a degree which, though natural in a tent, was certainly not necessary in a more stable structure. There was also a complete absence of any arch; but perhaps the most striking resemblance between a Chinese house and a tent lay in the divisions corresponding to the spaces between the poles or pillars, which necessarily, with the exception of the central space, were equidistant from each other. Nor, again, was it only in the interior of the house that the resemblance existed. The main building was slightly raised above the others, and was approached by a pathway flanked by the buildings of secondary importance. The women's quarters were at the back of the main building and thus screened from sight. No communication existed between the different buildings, and if it was desired to pass from one courtyard to another, the passage lay outside the intervening buildings, and not through them. All these conditions were such as would exist in a camp, the chief's\ntent being on a slightly higher ground than the rest, the approach to it being guarded by his officers' tents, and the communications from one to another being not under cover, but in the open air. There was another curious feature to which it was perhaps worth while to call attention in passing. The stone socket (song-tan) in which the main pillars stand is cut away on its lower side to such an extent that only a comparatively small portion of it rests on the stone slab beneath it. This, of course, is a weak point in the structure, but may be due to the fact that formerly the socket rested in the earth and not on a stone slab, when, of course, it would be advisable to reduce the size of the lower portion in order to admit of its easier reception into the earth. This, too, might point to the time when a substitute was sought for tent-pegs in the erection of solid buildings. There were other buildings than those of the type which had been referred to. For instance, at Soochow the Wu-hang Tien or Beamless Hall, and at Peking the Drum Tower, were specimens of structures in brick and stone, the like of which were found on a smaller scale at the cemeteries of persons connected with the Imperial family. In view, however, of the resemblances which existed, in appearance, interior arrangements, and general plan, he held that the original idea of a Chinese house was drawn from tents and tent life.\n\nDr. Faber said that in regard to the design of Chinese Yam\u00e9us and similar buildings, he thought that Mr. Carles' arguments were quite conclusive. He also agreed with General Mesny that the concave roof was an imitation of the lines of a tent or portable pavilion. Curved roofs were, according to all Chinese authorities, as ancient as Chinese architecture. They might believe that, as it marked a peculiarity of Chinese artistic feeling, which showed unmistakably a horror of straight lines, especially horizontal ones. The forms on the wall-pictures exhibited before them that evening were no valid argument against it, for they knew that Ts'in Shi Huang showed a great interest in going against every custom prevailing during the Chow dynasty, which was then crushed, and a new era in social and political life, not merely a new dynasty, was inaugurated with irresistible power and relentless cruelty. A few ancient relics at one place in China could never be conclusive in\nregard to the state of things at other places, and, still less at other periods.\n\nMr. G. J. Mounroso stated the usual points in architecture were construction, outline, and ornamentation, and as regards construction in Chinese buildings his experience led him to the conclusion that its principal feature was its utter badness. There was hardly a building erected so as to last. In pagodas bricks were used, and such structures lasted longer than most others. Wood formed the chief part of the majority of the buildings. The outline was the point to which Western architects liked to pay most attention. In Chinese buildings, except perhaps as regards the roof, and except in the case of pagodas, there was very little outline. The outline of the semi-circular bridges was pleasing to the eye, and had greater attention been paid to the foundations, they would probably have remained to the present day. The pleasantest feature of most Chinese buildings, and on which the greatest care was evidently bestowed, was the ornamentation. In this real merit could be discerned, and the work was well worthy of the study of those interested in such subjects.\n\nDr. Fawke proposed a vote of thanks to the lecturer for his very interesting lecture, and a similar compliment having been paid to the Chairman, the meeting adjourned.\n\nMinutes of the Annual General Meeting held at the Society's Library on Monday, 19th May 1890, at 9 p.m.\n\nMr. P. J. Hughes (President) in the chair. Between 30 and 40 persons were present, including ladies.\n\nThe Secretary read the Reports and Accounts for the year 1889-90.\n\nThe Chairman observed that the accounts showed a balance of Tls. 530, and Tls. 70 had since been collected. The Reports showed that satisfactory progress had been made during the past session. The Museum had not been so much favoured as usual, and it was hoped that sportsmen would bear this institution in mind. After\nexpressing a hope that the incoming Council would accelerate the work of printing the papers accepted by the Society, the Chairman said he hoped members would enable them to still further increase the attractiveness of their Journal by reviving the \"Notes and Queries\" which used to form an interesting item in the Transactions. Accounts of journeys in the interior would be acceptable, especially if read by the traveller himself. In this connexion he would remark that gentlemen who might happen to visit Si-an-fu in Shensi would confer a favour by reporting, as suggested by his Excellency Mr. von Brandt, on the efficiency of the measures taken for the protection and preservation of the Nestorian Tablet. It would be remembered that, at the instance of some missionary friends, the Council had a letter written to Mr. von Brandt on the subject, and that His Excellency and his colleagues had induced the members of the Tsung-li Yam\u00ean to interest themselves in the matter and to instruct the local authorities to take the necessary steps for the preservation of this monument of the early relations between China and the West. The meeting would be glad to learn that Dr. Bretschneider had promised a paper on the \"Botany of the Chinese Classics,\" being the second part of his Botanicon Sinicum, published by the Society ten years ago.\n\nOn the motion of Mr. P. G. von Mollendorff, seconded by Dr. Jamieson, the Report and Accounts were adopted.\n\nOn the motion of Mr. M. F. A. Fraser, seconded by Mr. Menzies, the following gentlemen were elected to constitute the Council for the ensuing year:\u2014Mr. P. J. Hughes, President; Dr. Edkins and Mr. von Mollendorff, Vice-Presidents; Mr. W. Bright, Hon. Secretary; Mr. Thos. Brown, Hon. Treasurer; Dr. Faber, Hon. Librarian; Mr. Carl Bock, Hon. Curator of the Museum; Dr. Jamieson, Rev. A. Williamson, LL.D., and Messrs. von Haas, Plaafard and D. C. Jansen, Councillors.\n\nThe Chairman observed that several of the retiring Council had deserved particularly well of the Society during the past year, among them being Dr. Faber, Dr. Jamieson, Mr. Bright and Mr. Bock.\n\nDr. Jamieson then proceeded to read a paper by Mr. E. H. Parker styled \"Notes on the Nestorians in China.\" (This paper is printed at pp. 289 sqq. of this volume.)\nDr. Edkins said he disagreed with the author of the paper in the conclusion he arrived at. There was a regular trade carried on by the Arabs between Bussorah and Canton, and the Nestorian Christians, having to come to China and coming from the same part of Asia as the Arabs, would naturally come by the same route. The author had been unwise in confining his attention to one book, which was a very unsafe thing to do in reading Chinese history.\n\nMr. W. Bright then read a paper by S. Ritter von Fries, on \"The 'Tent Theory' of Chinese Architecture.\" (This paper is printed at pp. 303 sqq. of this volume.)\n\nDr. Faner thought the writer of the paper rather missed the point of Mr. Carles' argument. Mr. Carles did not mean to express the idea that the curved roof was derived from tents like those of the Mongols, or that the ancient Chinese must have lived in such tents. On the contrary, Mr. Carles pointed to several yamens and other existing buildings as having derived their shape from structures in an encampment. Dr. Edkins, on the other hand, based his argument on some tablets which had been discovered in a certain place in China as indicating that in ancient China the curved roof was not known. They had learned, from Mr. Parker's paper just read, that it was not wise to confine oneself to one book; and it would not be wise to confine oneself, as he considered Dr. Edkins had done in his lecture on \"Chinese Architecture,\" to one monument, especially one belonging to a dynasty in which all the ancient customs of China were set upside down. The shape of the roof was shown in a line fastened above and below but not stretched tight.\n\nDr. Edkins thought the imitation of a tent was probably imported into China from other nations.\n\nGeneral Mesny thought some reason for the use of the curve in Chinese buildings might be found in the former use of bamboos with projecting ends.\n\nDr. Whitney said that from ideas gathered from the natives themselves it was probable that the whole thing arose from superstition. The Chinese never make a road straight for any considerable distance. Every here and there a crook is made, the idea being that any evil influence travelling along the road will be\ndissipated at the bend. The same idea had probably been applied to the roofs of houses.\n\nThe proceedings terminated with a vote of thanks to the Chairman.\n\nCOUNCIL'S REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1889-90.\n\nThe Council of the China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society beg to present their Report on the operations of the Society during the year ended 30th April 1890.\n\n1. Council.\u2014The office-bearers and members of Council elected at the Annual General Meeting held, under the presidency of Dr. R. A. Jamieson, on the 28th May 1889, were as follows:\n\nP. J. Hughes, M.A., President.\nW. R. Carles, Esq., Vice-Presidents.\nP. G. von Mollendorff, Esq.,\nWilliam Bright, Esq., Hon. Secretary.\nRev. Ernst Faber, Dr. Theol., Hon. Librarian.\nCarl Bock, Esq., Hon. Curator of Museum.\nR. M. Campbell, Esq., Hon. Treasurer.\nJoseph Edkins, D.D.,\nW. S. Emens, Esq.,\nJ. H. Focke, Dr. Jur.,\nR. A. Jamieson, M.A.,\nVen. Archdeacon Moule, R.D., Councillors.\n\nOf these, Messrs. W. R. Carles and R. M. Campbell, Dr. J. H. Focke, and the Ven. Archdeacon Moule resigned towards the end of their tenure of office, the first-named owing to his transfer to another port, and the others owing to their departure for Europe.\n2. Members.\u2014The number of members on the roll at the end of the period now reported on comprised 8 Honorary, 24 Corresponding, and 218 Ordinary Members (including in the last-mentioned category 7 Life Members). The total number of members has decreased somewhat, owing to a recent decision of the Council regarding the erasure from the list of members of the names of those whose subscriptions were much in arrear; the decrease, however, is to a certain extent more apparent than real, as many persons who on leaving China wished to resign their membership neglected to inform the Society of their intention. It is with much regret that the Council have to report the decease during 1889 of two prominent and learned Orientalists, Prof. W. Schott and Colonel Henry Yule, C.B., both of whom were Honorary Members of the Society.\n\n3. Meetings.\u2014At the meetings held since the date of the last Council's Report papers on the following subjects were read:\n\n\"Government by Women in Eastern Asia,\" by D. J. Macgowan, Esq., M.D.\n\n\"Prehistoric China revealed by the Chinese Written Characters,\" by Dr. Ernst Faber.\n\n\"Chinese Architecture,\" by Dr. J. Edkins.\n\nThe reading of these papers was followed by interesting discussions, notes of which will be found in the minutes of the meetings. In addition, the following papers have been accepted, and will be read at the Annual General Meeting:\n\n\"Notes on the Nestorians in China,\" by E. H. Parker, Esq.\n\n\"The Tent Theory of Chinese Architecture,\" by S. Ritter von Fries.\n\n4. Journal.\u2014Such of the papers mentioned above as have been accepted for publication will appear in the current volume, as also a valuable \"Essay on Manchu Literature,\" by Mr. P. G. von Mollendorff, and an abstract, prepared by Mr. H. B. Morse, of the replies to the Society's Circular on the \"Weights, Measures, and Currency of China.\" Incomplete as the information contained in this abstract may be, it has been thought well to publish it, and at the same time to solicit further particulars from those in a position to furnish them, so as to allow of the information being amplified at an early date.\nIn the current volume will also be found the correspondence between the President of the Society and the Doyen of the Diplomatic Body at Peking concerning the preservation of the Nestorian Tablet and other ancient monuments at Si-an-fu; and the Council would here beg to tender their thanks to the members of the Diplomatic Corps for the interest they have evinced in the subject, and to the Chinese High Authorities for their ready willingness to undertake the necessary measures for the protection of these historical treasures.\n\n5. Officers' Reports.\u2014Appended are the Treasurer's, Curator's and Librarian's Reports. From the Treasurer's Report it will be seen that the Society's financial position is exceptionally satisfactory. The balance standing to credit in the Society's Account is Tls. 582.81, being an increase over that of 1888 of Tls. 379.29; while the Museum Account shows a credit balance of Tls. 120.64. An increase has to be noted in the sale of the Society's Journals, thus affording satisfactory evidence of the growing appreciation in which the early as well as the more recent publications of the Society are held both in China and abroad. The Treasurer reports that repeated applications to many members have failed to secure the payment of their annual subscriptions. Some of the $615 stated in his Report as outstanding under this head has since been paid in, but a considerable sum still remains to be collected. Judging that members who have not responded to the Treasurer's applications do not desire to have their names borne on the Society's roll of members, the Council, in January last, decided to remove from the list the names of those who have failed to pay their subscriptions for the past three years, and henceforth members whose subscriptions are one year in arrear will receive no further publications of the Society, while, as a reminder, the names of such members as have not been heard from for two years will in the published list be printed in italics.\n\nThe Curator's Report gives a list of the specimens presented during the year. While thanking those who in their up-country trips, in whatever province they may be, think of the needs of the Museum, the Council cannot but regret that the collection is still below the standard, as regards variety, that they and all students of\nnatural history desire to see it reach. The Council have to thank M. Janet for his valuable services in arranging and classifying the collection of butterflies in the Museum.\n\nThe Librarian reports favourably of the work in connexion with the Library, and the thanks of the Council are due to Dr. E. Faber for his untiring zeal and devotion to its interests. Much solid work has been done, and a great advance has been made towards arranging in convenient order, binding, numbering, and cataloguing the works in the Library, and in utilising to the utmost extent the limited accommodation the room affords.\n\nWM. BRIGHT,\nHon. Secretary.\n\n30th April 1890.\nAppendix I.\u2014Hon. Treasurer's Report.\n\nThe balance at credit of the Society on 31st December 1888 was Tls. 153.58; the balance at credit on 31st December 1889 was Tls. 532.81. As may be seen from the accounts, the increase is owing to a large number of subscriptions that were in arrear having been collected during the past twelve months. It is greatly to be regretted that subscriptions, part due, are still outstanding to the extent of \u00a3615, viz.:\n\nFor the year 1883\u2014\u00a3 5\n\" \" 1884\u2014\u00a3 5\n\" \" 1885\u2014\u00a3 5\n\" \" 1886\u2014\u00a3 15\n\" \" 1887\u2014\u00a3 55\n\" \" 1888\u2014\u00a3255\n\" \" 1889\u2014\u00a3275\n\n\u00a3615\n\nAll members whose subscriptions are in arrear have been written to and notified of the fact. No doubt some of the letters have not reached their destination, but in many cases this cannot be supposed to be the case. There is a considerable increase in the amount received by sale of the Society's publications, over the amount shown in last year's accounts. Some of the receipts shown in this year's accounts, however, should have been included in the 1888 accounts, but, as stated in the Treasurer's report last year, as the amount was not considerable it was allowed to stand over.\n\nMuseum.\u2014The usual grants have been received from the English and French Municipal Councils. The balance in hand on 31st December 1889 was only Tls. 120.64, against Tls. 178.41 at the end of the previous year; against which, however, it may be noted that the interest due on the loan from the Recreation Fund (Tls. 75) was not paid in 1888, whereas this year has borne the charge for that as well as the current year.\n\nR.

Curator.\n\nShanghai, 29th March 1890.\nAppendix III.\u2014Librarian's Report.\n\nThe Library has given an unusual amount of work during the year, but is now getting into a more satisfactory condition. It was found necessary to hand over the sale and despatch of the Society's publications to the publishers, Kelly & Walsh, Limited, of Shanghai, thus relieving the Librarian of a deal of work. By this transfer of stock of publications from the Library, the room has gained sufficient space for a suitable arrangement of the many valuable books contained in it. Some of the old book-cases have been removed and two large new ones acquired, which fill all available space of two walls of the room. As between seven and eight thousand pamphlets, fascicules of periodicals, papers and books were lying about useless, because unbound and uncatalogued, it was found necessary to begin binding at once. This is still going on. The task is a tedious one, taking much time, as many portions of different books were mingled together. Over 400 volumes have been bound during the year by a Chinese binder, who needs every volume put in his hands in proper order, but manages nevertheless to make a mistake now and then. It was unfortunate that the well-trained coolie became ill and died during the summer. His substitute has, so far, been of little help. Mr. T'ang was engaged, on the 1st January 1890, to assist in preparing a new catalogue. Of the Society's Journal, Fascicle 3 of Vol. XXIII, for the year 1888-89, has been published and distributed during the year.

ALEXANDER WILLIAMSON, LL.D.\n\nThe death of Dr. Alexander Williamson, on August 28th of this year, at Chefoo, deprives our Society of one of its oldest members and of a contributor to our Journal of many years' standing.\n\nHis Journeys in North China, Manchuria and Mongolia, in two volumes, contain many valuable observations on the regions he visited as a missionary traveller. He was among the first to make known the mineral treasures of North China, taking his place in this respect with Pumelly and von Richthoven. The latter in his large work on China fully recognizes Dr. Williamson's contributions to our knowledge. It was this book which led to his receiving the honorary degree of LL.D. from the University of Glasgow, where he had received his collegiate education. His little book The World: Whence cometh it? by \"Tu Quoque\" shows much familiarity with modern science. He took a very decided pleasure in reading books of science by contemporary authors, and the knowledge thus acquired has enriched his works in Chinese. In this language he published a work on Botany, a Natural Theology out of McCosh, a Life of Christ and a History of Religions. He also wrote much on political science, sociology, education and kindred subjects. Perhaps McCosh's Method of the Divine Government was the chief influence on him as a translator, and it was this which led to that happy combination of modern science with religious teaching which characterizes his works in Chinese. He secured writers having facility in style, and as a translator he thought out the ideas himself, mastered them, clothed them in his own language,\nturned them into Chinese colloquial and then left the control of the style in the Chinese writer's hands. He wrote much in monthly periodicals in Chinese and was an occasional contributor to the Sh\u00ean-pao daily newspaper. In the literature of the Protestant Missions his works take a high place. He had a faculty for exposition and a keen avidity for acquiring knowledge which stood him in good stead in making books. By their tincture of philosophy and science an elevated tone was imparted to them. Several of his books have been reprinted in Japan. All are in a high degree readable and valuable.\n\nIllness led to Dr. Williamson's retirement from China in 1858 and prevented his return for five years. He gave in all thirty years to China, and not only worked usefully himself as a translator, but was very active and successful in founding societies and obtaining funds to print works translated by others. This is shewn in the history of the School and Text Book Series and of the Society for the Diffusion of Christian and General Knowledge among the Chinese.\n\nJ.

The delay was occasioned for the most part by scientific occupation in other fields.\n\nThe subject to be dealt with in the subsequent pages is the Chinese names of plants occurring in the Chinese Classics and some other Chinese works of remote antiquity, and their botanical identification, as far as the scanty ancient records regarding these plants and the present state of our knowledge of the Chinese Flora will permit. The edition of the Chinese Classics in an English translation, first undertaken by an accomplished scholar, thirty years ago, is now nearly complete, and this gigantic work has imperishably connected the name of the eminent sinologue referred to with these Records of ancient Chinese civilisation. The first five (*i.e.* eight) volumes of Dr. Legge's *Chinese Classics*, published in China, reproduce the Chinese text. It is a matter of regret that the translation of the *Li ki* or Book of Rites, which Legge published in 1885 in Vols. XXVII and XXVIII\nof Max M\u00fcller's Sacred Books of the East, is without the original.\\(^1\\)\n\nLegge's Classics form, of course, the principal basis of my investigations. The great merit of his elaborate edition is, that all the valuable information on various subjects scattered in the bulky Chinese editions of the Classics and their commentaries, has now been made easily accessible to European savants. Legge translates, besides the Chinese text of the Classics, most of the Chinese commentaries on the subject written by Chinese scholars of different periods, and his own criticism always shows admirable good sense. As to his attempts to identify Chinese names of natural objects, Legge, who does not pretend to be a naturalist, is sometimes mistaken, but on the whole it must be said that even in this field of investigation the author has done much towards the elucidation of dubious questions. In his Shi king, he makes constant reference to some modern Japanese plates illustrating this Classic, and especially the beasts, birds, insects and plants mentioned in it. As the greater part of the plants figured in Japanese botanical works have been identified by European botanists, Legge generally depends upon these identifications. Occasionally he also relies upon identifications given in Medhurst's and Williams' Dictionaries.\n\nThe names of plants occurring in the Chinese Classics are still for the most part in use and applied to the same plants\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) It is not obvious why Legge, in his translation of the Li ki, changed the mode of transliterating Chinese sounds adopted by him for all his previous translations. His new transliteration is not a happy one, and gives rise to confusion. Thus the \u5468 Chou dynasty, in his Li ki, is termed Kaz, the \u6625\u79cb Ch'un tris is changed into Khun khin. His excellent translation, therefore, is not always easily understood without the Chinese text at hand. Besides this, the new transliteration does not seem to be familiar to him, and he occasionally commits errors. [Comp. I, p. 20, Khia dynasty, and p. 294, note 1, Zhin. In both cases he means the \u7e41 Tris dynasty.]\nnowadays. But in not a few cases the characters denoting plants in the classical period became altogether obsolete in later times, or lost their original meaning, and are now not applied to plants. Regarding such obscure characters and passages, the Western translator of Chinese classical writings finds himself constrained to rely entirely upon the frequently unsatisfactory commentaries of Chinese scholars who lived many centuries after the time of Confucius, and who never produce proofs for their assertions. Thus the character \u8336 t'\u00fc, which is of frequent occurrence in the Shi king, is said by the Chinese commentators to denote entirely different plants in different passages of this Classic, viz.: Sow-thistle, smart-weed, rushes, and it appears that this was also an ancient name to designate the tea-plant [comp. infra, 307].\n\nThe character \u679d t'iao nowadays means the branch of a tree. It has the same meaning in the Shi king and in other Classics. But in one passage in the Book of Poetry the Chinese commentators make it mean the Catalpa tree [Legge says white fir] comp. infra, 511. The Rh ya, 236, gives t'iao as a name for the punelo. The character \u82e6 k'i, in the Classics, is said by some authors to mean millet, others take it to be lettuce [comp. infra, 346, 364].\n\nConsidering these difficulties encountered in the critical investigation of ancient Chinese writings, and especially in ascertaining the correct meaning of characters applied to plants in early ages, the reader must not expect a completely satisfactory botanical elucidation of the matter, the design of this paper being merely to show what can be done in the way of botanical explanation of Chinese classical names of plants.\nNOTES ON CHINESE, JAPANESE AND EUROPEAN WORKS CONSULTED IN THE PREPARATION OF THIS PAPER.\n\nThe books recognized as of highest authority in China, and which we are accustomed to term the \"Chinese Classics,\" are comprehended under the denominations of the \u4e94\u7d93 wu king, or five king, and the \u56db\u66f8 sz\u2018 shu, or four shu.\n\nThe five king or canonical works are\n\n(1.) The \u6613\u7d93 Yi king, or Book of Changes.\n(2.) The \u66f8\u7d93 Shu king, or Book of History.\n(3.) The \u8a69\u7d93 Shi king, or Book of Poetry.\n(4.) The \u79ae\u8a18 Li ki, or Record of Rites.\n(5.) The \u6625\u79cb Ch'un te'tiu, the Spring and Autumn Annals.\n\nThe authorship, or compilation rather, of all these works is loosely attributed to Confucius, but much of the Li ki is from later hands.\n\nThe four shu, or four books [of the four philosophers] are\n\n(1.) The \u8ad6\u8a9e Lun yu, or \"Digested Conversation,\" being occupied chiefly with the sayings of \u5b54\u5b50 K'ung tsz\u2018 (Confucius) [B.C. 551-479].\n(2.) The \u5927\u5b78 Ta hio, or Great Learning, commonly attributed to \u66fe\u53c3 Tseng sen, a disciple of the sage, born B.C. 506.\n(3.) The \u4e2d\u5eb8 Chung yung, or Doctrine of the Mean, ascribed to \u5b54\u4f0b K'ung ki [B.C. 500-438], the grandson of Confucius.\n(4.) The works of \u5b5f\u5b50 Meng tsz\u2018, or Mencius [B.C. 372-289].\nIn the famous compilation of the classical books undertaken by order of the Emperor T'ai Tsung [A.D. 627-649] of the T'ang dynasty, there are thirteen king:\n\n1. The \u6613\u7d93 Yi king, or Book of Changes.\n2. The \u66f8\u7d93 Shu king, or Book of History.\n3. The \u8a69\u7d93 Shi king, or Book of Poetry.\n4. The \u79ae\u8a18 Li ki, or Record of Rites.\n5. The \u5468\u79ae Chou li, the Ritual of the Chou dynasty (v. infra).\n6. The \u5100\u79ae I li, or Decorum Ritual [v. infra].\n7-9. \u6625\u79cb\u4e09\u50b3 Ch'un ts'in san chuan, the Spring and Autumn Annals, with the three expositions or annotations [v. infra].\n10. The \u8ad6\u8a9e Lun yu, Sayings of Confucius.\n11. \u5b5f\u5b50 Meng tse', the Works of Mencius.\n12. The \u5b5d\u7d93 Hiao king, or Classic of Filial Piety [v. infra].\n13. The \u5c1a\u66f8 Rh ya, an ancient Dictionary [v. infra].\n\nThe Ta hio and the Chung yung do not appear in this list, for they are contained in the Li ki.\n\nThe same arrangement is found in the great edition of the Classics which appeared in 1815 with the title \u5341\u4e09\u7d93\u8a3b\u758f Shi san king chu shu, the Thirteen Classics with the commentaries. The character \u8a3b refers to the earlier commentators, of the Han and Tsin dynasties, whilst \u758f denotes the explanations, glosses, etc., of authors of the T'ang and Sung dynasties.\n\nThe \u6613\u7d93 Yi king, or Book of Changes, has been translated by Legge in Max M\u00fcller's edition of the Sacred Books of the East, 1882, Vol. XVI. It is of no interest for our investigations.\nThe \u66f8\u7d93 Shu king, or Book of History, termed also \u5085\u66f8 Shang shu, was originally compiled by Confucius from the historical remains of the Yu, Hia, Shang and Chon dynasties. Besides some scattered notices of Chinese plants, this Classic contains a chapter \u79ae\u8a18 Yu kung, or Tribute of the Emperor Yu, which presents a peculiar interest for us. This is a geographical description of ancient China, referring to about B.C. 2200, in which are enumerated the principal natural productions of the nine provinces into which China was then divided. [Legge's Classics, III; 2 volumes, 1865.]\n\nThe \u8a69\u7d93 Shi king, or Book of Poetry. [Legge's Classics, IV; 2 volumes, 1871, 1872.] The Shi king is a collection of odes, ballads and songs used by the people of the various petty states of China in ancient times. Legge has proved that the Shi king, arranged very much as we now have it, was current in China long before Confucius. After the burning of the records of the past by order of the Emperor Ts'in Shi [B.C. 220], and the fall of the short-lived Ts'in dynasty, three different texts of the Shi king which had escaped the catastrophe made their appearance in the Han dynasty when the edict suppressing literary works had been repealed. Only one of these texts has come down to us. It is called \u6bdb\u8a69 Mao shi, the Shi king of Mao, which is the Book of Poetry in its present form. This text belonged to \u6bdb\u4ea8 Mao heng, a native of Lu. He is also termed \u5927\u6bdb Ta Mao, the Greater Mao. He was a disciple of \u8340\u5b50 S\u00fcn tsz', who lived in the third century B.C., and wrote a commentary on the Shi king, which was lost. But he had communicated his knowledge of the Shi to another Mao, \u6bdb\u53d4 Mao chang, also called \u5c0f\u6bdb Siao Mao, the Lesser Mao, who was a great scholar at the court of \u6b66\u738b king Hien of \u6cb3\u9593 Ho kien (in the Province of Chili), a brother of the Emperor Wu ti [B.C. 140-86]. King Hien was one of the most diligent labourers\nfor the recovery of ancient books, and presented Mao's text and the work of Heng at the court of the Emperor King. Legge says probably in B.C. 129, but King Ti reigned B.C. 156-140. Chang himself published his explanation of the Shi \u6bdb\u6c0f\u8a69\u50b3 in 29 chapters, which still remains.\n\nThe Shi king is especially rich in Chinese names of plants, cultivated economic plants and wild-growing herbs and trees. Confucius said [Analects, p. 187] that from the Shi we become extensively acquainted with the names of birds, beasts and plants. The names of a number of cultivated and wild plants appear in the first of the Odes of Pin, entitled \u4e03\u6708 Ts'\u0131 yue, which is of high antiquity. It is accepted by the famous Duke of Chou [12th century B.C.] as a description of the life in Pin in the olden days [comp. Shi king, 226]. \u9b31 or \u5206 Pin was a small principality in Southern Shensi, Pin chou fu, where the chiefs of Chou dwelt for nearly five centuries [B.C. 1796-1325].\n\nAncient names for grains are mentioned in the Ode \u751f\u6c11 Sheng min, p. 465, which is devoted to the legend of \u540e\u7a37 Hou tsi, to whom the princes of Chou traced their lineage [comp. Botan. sin., I, 76], and likewise in the Ode Pi kung, praising Hou tsi [Shi king, 620].\n\nIn the second half of the third century of our era \u9678\u6a5f Lu ki, a distinguished functionary in the kingdom of \u5967 Wu [south of the Yang tsz'], wrote a commentary in two books on the herbs, trees, birds, beasts, insects and fishes mentioned in Mao's version of the Shi king, \u6bdb\u8a69\u912d\u6728\u9ce5\u7378\u87f2\u9b5a\u758f Mao shi ts'ao mu niao shou ch'ung yu shu. It is found in the collection of books of the Han, Wei, etc., periods [Botan. sin., I, 135]. Legge states that the original work was lost, and that that now current was compiled, it is not known when or by whom, mainly from K'ung Ying-ta, who in his commentaries on the Shi king quotes the corresponding\ndescriptions of plants from Lu ki's treatise. But there are fragments of other texts of it extant quoted by other ancient authors and preserved in the Pen ts'ao kang mu, the T'u shu ts'i ch'eng, etc., which sometimes differ from the text in the Han Wei ts'ung shu. Lu ki treats only of the wild-growing plants of the Shi (nearly 100). His commentaries on plants, at least in the mutilated and corrupt form in which they have survived, are of little value, his descriptions being generally extremely vague and sometimes unintelligible. For instance, when he uses the character \u5b50 tsz' we are always in doubt whether he means fruit or seed, for he applies the same term to both, although the Chinese have a special character \u8457 shi to designate the fruit of plants, while the seed is \u5b50 tsz'. Nevertheless Lu ki has always been considered as an authority by later Chinese commentators on the Shi.\n\nRegarding the Li Classics, I may be allowed to follow Legge in his clear exposition of the subject.\n\nThere are now three Chinese Classics into which the term Li enters, the \u5112\u79ae I li, the \u5468\u79ae Chou li and the \u79ae\u8a18 Li ki, frequently styled, both by the Chinese themselves and by sinologists, the \"three Rituals.\" The first two are books of the Chou dynasty [B.C. 1122-249], the third, the Li ki, may contain passages of an earlier date, but as a collection, in its present form, it does not go higher than the Han, and was not completed till the second century B.C.\n\nAt the rise of the Han dynasty [B.C. 206] the I li and the Chou li were in a condition of disorder and incompleteness. They had suffered with the other books from conflagrations and proscriptions. The sovereigns of the Han undertook the task of gathering and arranging the fragments of the ancient works. In B.C. 164, the Emperor Wen ti ordered the great scholars to compile the \"Royal Ordinances,\" the fifth book of the Li ki.\nInternal evidence shows that when this treatise was made, the *Li*, or portions of it at least, had been recovered. Afterwards king Hien of Hokien [*v. supra*], who was a patron of literary men, added a mass of tablets to the *Li*. The recovery of the *Chou li* came not long after. Someone brought to king Hien of Hokien the tablets of the *Chou li*, then called \u5468\u5b98 *Chou kwan*, or Official Book of the Chou. The *Chou li* is a constitutional, not a ritual, work. Since the T'ang dynasty it has been known by its present title.\n\nThe most distinguished of the *Li* scholars in the time of the Emperors Huan [72-48 B.C.] and Ch'eng [32-6 B.C.] was \u540e\u84bc Hou Ts'ang, the author of the compilation called in the catalogue of \u5289\u6b46 Liu Hin [some years before our era], \u66f2\u81fa\u8a18 K'\u00fc t'ai ki. Two of his disciples \u6234\u5fb7 Tai Te and \u6234\u8056 Tai Sheng, cousins, were also celebrated for their ability. Te, the elder of the two, commonly called \u5927\u6234 Ta Tai, the Greater Tai, digested the mass of *p'ien* [214] of the *Li* books and reduced the number to 85. The younger Tai, \u5c0f\u6234 Siao Tai, doing the same for his cousin's work, reduced it to 46. This second condensation met with general acceptance and was styled the \u79ae\u8a18 Li ki.\n\nThe *Li* of the Greater Tai, the \u5927\u6234\u79ae Ta Tai li, was a voluminous compilation. As the shorter work of his cousin obtained a wide circulation, his fell into neglect. A portion of it is still current, and found in the large collection of books of the Han and Wei dynasties, 39 books in 10 sections. It includes the fragment of the Hia dynasty [B.C. 2205-1766] \u590f\u5c0f\u6b63 Hia siao ch'eng, or Calendar of the Hia. This, an undoubted record of the Hia epoch, said to have been found in the grave of Confucius, is a very obscure document, for the most part completely unintelligible without the commentaries by different ancient authors. It notices, in the form of aphoristic sentences, 122 in number, various natural\nphenomena, the proceedings of husbandry, and the changes which successively take place in the appearance of the vegetable and animal world in the twelve months of the year. The year of the Hia began, as it does at the present time in China, between the 20th January and 19th February. More than thirty names of plants occur in the text. The Calendar of the Hia was translated into French by E. Biot in the Journal Asiatique, 1840, b. p. 551-560. An English version of it, along with the Chinese text, was published in 1882 by Professor R. K. Douglas, of King's College, in the short-lived Orientalia antiqua, edited by M. Terrien de la Couperie.\n\nThe \u79ae\u8a18 Li ki contains much interesting information regarding Chinese economic plants, especially those used for food, viz., cereals, vegetables and fruits. [See Chap. I, k'\u00fc li, Universal Ritual; III, wu jing ki, Royal Regulations; X, nei tz', Family Rites.] One of the most interesting chapters of the Li ki for our investigation is IV\u2014the \u6708\u4ee4 Y\u00fce ling, Proceedings of Government in the different months\u2014as Legge translates it. It is ascribed to \u5415\u4e0d\u97cb L\u00fc Pu-wei [d. B.C. 237], but evidently his compilation was based upon ancient records. The Y\u00fce ling is a counterpart of the Hia shao ch'eng, and likewise notices the proceedings of husbandry and the plants and animals making their appearance in each month of the year. It is therefore also termed the \"Calendar of the Chou Dynasty\" [B.C. 1122-249]. The year of the Chou always commenced with our December.\u00b2\n\n\u00b2 A similar ancient document is found in the \u5468\u66f8 Chou shu, which latter belongs to the so-called Bamboo Books\u2014ancient writings on bamboo, discovered A.D. 279, in a grave. It is entitled \u6642\u8a13\u89e3 Shi h\u00fcn hiai and resembles much the Y\u00fce ling in its contents. It was translated by Biot in the Journal Asiatique, 1840, b. p. 561-568, with the title, \"Exposition des saisons.\"\nThe \u5468\u79ae Chou li, or Official Book of the Chou dynasty, gives the details of the various offices established under the Chou. It is generally regarded as the work of the Duke of Chou [B.C. 1130]. This has been translated into French by BIOT\u2014Le Tcheou li, ou Rites des Tcheou, 1851, 2 vols.\n\nA great many plants are mentioned in the Chou li. BIOT has caused much confusion by his attempts to identify the Chinese names of these plants.\n\nThe \u5100\u79ae I li, or Decorum Ritual, treats of family affairs and directions for domestic life. It has not yet been translated into any European language.\n\nThe \u6625\u79cb Ch'un ts'iu, Spring and Autumn Annals, the only one of the five Classics actually written by Confucius, is a history of his native state \u9b6f Lu, from B.C. 722 to 484. An amplification of the original work was made by one of his pupils \u5de6\u90b1\u660e Tso Kiu-ming, his work being named \u5de6\u50b3 Tso chuan, or Tso's Narrative. [LEGGE's Classics, V, 2 vols. The Chun tsew and the Tso chuan, 1872.]\n\nLEGGE's Classics, Vol. I, 1861, contains the Confucian Analects, \u8ad6\u8a9e Lun yu, the Great Learning, \u5927\u5b78 Ta hio, and the Doctrine of the Mean \u4e2d\u5eb8 Chung yung [v. supra].\n\nLEGGE's Classics, Vol. II, 1861, contains Mencius \u5b5f\u5b50 Meng tse' [v. supra].\n\nThe \u5b5d\u7d93 Hiao king, Classic of Filial Piety. It claims to be a conversation held between Confucius and his disciples Tseng sen. Translated by LEGGE, 1879, in MAX M\u00dcLLER'S Sacred Books of the East, Vol. III.\n\nThe ancient Dictionary Rh ya. [See infra, Chap. I.]\n\nAmong the numerous Chinese commentators on the Classics, the following are the most conspicuous:\u2014\n\u6bdb\u4ea8 Mao Heng and \u6bdb\u82cc Mao Ch'ang\u2014the Greater and the Lesser Mao\u2014to whom the present text of the Shi king is attributed. The elder Mao lived in the first half, the younger in the second half, of the second century B.C. Legge states that it is not positively determined which of them wrote the explanations of the Shi. The editors of the thirteen Classics, however, attribute them to the elder Mao [see the first page of the Shi king, where we read \u6bdb\u4ea8\u6ce8]. Mao's explanations, as far as plants are concerned, are very short and unsatisfactory. He confines himself generally to quoting the Rh ya.\n\n\u5b54\u5b89\u570b K'ung An-kuo. He lived in the second century B.C., deciphered the ancient text of the Shu king and commented upon it.\n\n\u912d\u53f8\u8fb2 Cheng Szu-nung. First century of our era. He commented upon the Chou li. Commentator \"A.\" of Biot.\n\n\u8cc8\u9035 Kia K'ul. A.D. 30-101. He commented upon the Shi king and the Tso chuan.\n\n\u99ac\u878d Ma Yung. A.D. 79-166. He commented upon the Li ki, the Shi king and other Classics.\n\n\u912d\u7384 Cheng Huan or \u912d\u5eb7\u6210 Cheng Kang-ch'eng, a disciple of Ma Yung [A.D. 127-200].

He commented upon the Li ki, the Shi king, the Shu king and the Ch'un ts'iu.\nKia Kung-yen. T'ang dynasty, 8th century. He commented upon the Chou li. Commentator \"C.\" of Biot.\n\nChu Hi. A.D. 1130-1200. Eminent Chinese philosopher. He commented upon the Shi king. Legge has a high opinion of his critical judgment. His notices regarding plants, however, are not always trustworthy.\n\nWang Chao-y\u00fc. 12th century. He commented upon the Chou li. Commentator \"D.\" of Biot.\n\nYen Ts'an. 13th century. He wrote a commentary on the Shi king. Legge ranks him next to Chu Hi.\n\nBesides the Classics, there are many other Chinese works of high antiquity in which plants are mentioned. I may notice the following:\n\nChu shu, the Bamboo books, is the name appropriated to a large collection of ancient documents, nearly 20 different works written on bamboo tablets, and discovered, A.D. 279, in the tomb of one of the princes of the state of Wei, who died 295 B.C. One of these is the Chu shu ki nieu, Bamboo Record, or Annals. This commences with the reign of Huang Ti and extends to B.C. 299.\n\nAn English translation of the Bamboo Annals, along with the Chinese text, has been given by Legge in his Shu king, Proleg. 105-183. My quotations are taken from this translation.\n\nAnother book of this collection is the Ki chung Chou shu, a record of the Chou dynasty. [See Botan. sin., I, No. 247].\n\nThe Shan hai king is by its title the Classic of the Mountains and Seas, but Wylie calls it more correctly the Hill and River Classic. It is generally ascribed to the Emperor Yu [B.C. 2200] and professes to give a descriptive account of charts of the nine provinces engraved on nine\nmetal vases which Y\u00fc had caused to be cast of metal received from the nine provinces of China. Regarding these nine vases (\u4e5d\u9f0e Kiu ting) see Legge's Tso chuan, p. 293, and Bamboo Annals, p. 175, where the history of these vases is related. See also Bazin's interesting account of the Shan hai king in the Journal asiatique, VIII, 1839, p. 337 seqq.\n\nThere can be no doubt that the Shan hai king is a book of remote antiquity. \u5b50\u590f Tsz' Hia, 5th century B.C., one of the disciples of Confucius, is reported in the \u5bb6\u8a9e Kia yu, or Family Sayings of Confucius, to have mentioned the \u5c71\u7d93 Shan king, Hill Classic, evidently the same as the Shan hai king, as a book which existed in the time of the Shang dynasty [B.C. 1782-1134].\n\nThe editions of the Shan hai king now current are in 18 books, with the commentary of \u90ed\u749e Kuo P'o [A.D. 276-324], the same who commented upon the Rh ya. Only the first five books refer to China proper, the rest is devoted to foreign countries, all fabulous. The headings of the first five books are: Mountains of the South, Mountains of the West, Mountains of the North, Mountains of the East, and Mountains of the Centre of China. Few of the names of mountains and rivers enumerated therein can be identified. Each mountain is believed to be haunted by peculiar sprites, to whom sacrifices are to be offered. The animals, plants and stones produced in these mountains are named and described. The descriptions of trees and herbaceous plants in the Shan hai king contain much of the miraculous. Almost every plant or fruit is reported to have, when eaten, a peculiar effect upon the functions of the mind. But there occur in this ancient work about 70 names of plants which are still in use.\n\nThe \u96e2\u9a37 Li sao, one of the poetical productions of \u5c48\u539f K'\u00fc Y\u00fcan, a minister of the Kingdom of \u695a Ch'u [about\nB.C. 314]. It was translated into French, in 1870 by the Marquis d'Herv\u00e9y de St. Denys. About 30 names of plants appear in the Li sao, and many of them refer to fabulous trees and herbaceous plants.\n\nThe \u7a2e\u690d\u66f8 Chung chi shu, a treatise on husbandry by \u6c88\u52dd\u4e4b Fan Sheng-chi. Second half of the first century B.C. [See Botan. sin., I, p. 76].\n\nThe \u65b9\u8a00 Fang yen, a comparative vocabulary of synonyms used in the various feudal states of ancient China, by \u694a\u96c4 Yang Hiung [B.C. 53\u2013A.D. 18]. He is also styled \u694a\u57f7\u7fa9 Yang Chi-ki. [Comp. Botan. sin., I, No. 106.]\n\nThe \u8aaa\u6587 Shuo wen is an ancient dictionary of the Chinese language, composed by \u8a31\u614e Hsu Shen at the close of the first century of our era. In it the matter is found arranged according to the radical part of the character, under the head of 540 radicals. It contains about 10,000 characters, all written in the Lesser Seal. The pronunciation is vaguely given, and also concise remarks on the meaning. About 760 of these characters refer to plants, but the explanations furnished with respect to the names are for the most part unsatisfactory, e.g. \u8349\u540d, \u6728\u540d, name of a plant, of a tree, etc., or the name is defined by a synonym.\n\nThe \u5ee3\u96c5 Kuang ya, called also \u64b2\u96c5 Po ya, a kind of vocabulary or dictionary published in the third century [see Botan. sin., No. 383]. It professes to be an enlargement of the Rh ya. The section on plants contains nothing but names and synonyms, without any explanation.\n\nAmong the numerous Chinese works on Botany there are four which the reader will find frequently quoted in my Notes on the classical plants, and which have already been treated of at length in the first part of my Botanicon sinicum.\nThe \u6b21\u8352\u672c\u8349 Kiu huang pen ts'ao [Botan. sin., I, p. 54-69], a treatise on plants available for use as food in time of scarcity, by a prince of the Ming dynasty, accompanied by wood-cuts, published towards the end of the 14th century.

It is the earliest Chinese attempt to compile a dictionary. The authorship is ascribed to \u5b50\u590f Tsz Hia, a disciple of Confucius. It is, however, believed that a part of the work was written by the famous Duke of Chou in the 12th century B.C. Tsz Hia was born B.C. 507 and lived to a great age, for we find him [B.C. 406] at the court of Prince Wen of Wei, to whom he gave copies of some of the classical books. [See Legge's Classics, I, Pro., p. 118.]\n\nThe Rh ya is a dictionary of terms used in Chinese classical and other ancient writings, the words being arranged in categories with regard to affinity of subjects. Its present shape dates from the third century of our era, when Kuo P'o, a celebrated scholar and commentator who lived A.D. 276-324, remodelled the matter and added commentaries. It is divided into 19 sections, of which seven (comprising about two thirds of the whole work) treat of natural objects\u2014herbaceous plants, trees, insects, fishes, birds, quadrupeds and domestic animals. But the original text of the Rh ya, as far at least as natural objects are concerned, is generally nothing more than a list of names and synonyms. Some of the editions of the Rh ya are illustrated with plates, rudely executed cuts. As is stated in the preface, these drawings date from the Sung period, but they may have been based upon the woodcuts appended, as the ancient catalogues state, to Kuo P'o's edition of the Rh ya.\u00b2\n\n\u00b2 In 1882 a new edition of the Rh ya, in 12mo, was published at Shanghai. It is accompanied with the illustrations and is well printed.\nThe *Rh ya* is comprised in the above-noted great edition of the thirteen Classics, and appears there with the title \u7e7c\u96c5\u6ce8\u758f *Rh ya chu shu*\u2014the *Rh ya* commented and explained. The character \u6ce8 refers to the commentary of \u90ed\u749e Kuo P'o. For further particulars see *Botan. sin.*, I, 35.\n\nThe character \u758f, which Legge translates by expositions, glosses and disquisitions, denotes the explanations by \u90a2\u663a Hing Ping, a scholar of the Sung dynasty, who lived A.D. 932-1010.\n\nKuo P'o states in his preface that for his commentaries on the *Rh ya* he had made use of previous explanations. Hing Ping frequently quotes authors of the Han period who had attempted to explain this ancient dictionary. The earliest of these seems to have been \u5289\u6b46 Liu Hin, a celebrated author of the first century B.C. Hing Ping calls him \u820d\u4eba She Jen, which seems to have been his pseudonym, but she jen, in the time of the Han, was also a title\u2014secretary. As the names and synonyms in the *Rh ya* run in a continued series of characters without any break, it is sometimes difficult to decide how these names are to be separated. She Jen was the first to indicate this division.\n\n\u6a0a\u5149 Fan Kuang and \u674e\u5de1 Li Sun are likewise mentioned by Hing Ping as commentators of the *Rh ya* in the Han period. Regarding the first, we know that he was a man from \u4eac\u5146 King chao and lived in the Posterior Han dynasty [A.D. 25-221].\n\n\u5b6b\u708e Sun Yen or \u5b6b\u53d4\u7136 Sun Shu Jan, who also commented upon the *Rh ya*, was a contemporary of Kuo P'o.\n\nBoth Kuo P'o and Hing Ping, in their explanations, occasionally refer to two ancient authors named \u8b1d\u6c0f Sie and \u67d0\u6c0f Mou. As their cognomina are not given (they are evidently considered as well known scholars) it is impossible to say who is meant; but there is some probability that the\nformer is \u8b1d\u66fc\u537f Sie Man-k'ing, of the first century of our era, who commented upon the Shi [Legge's Shi king, Prol., p. 11], and the other may be an author of the Han alluded to in Legge's Shu king, Prol., p. 19.\n\nHing Ping quotes frequently the \u672c\u8349 Pen ts'ao, or Herbal, commented by \u85e4\u6c0f T'ao. This is without doubt the work mentioned in the Sui shu, chap. 34, on Literature, with the title \u95b1\u5f18\u666f\u672c\u8349\u7d93\u96c6\u6ce8 in 7 kuan, or chapters, or the Pen ts'ao king, arranged and explained by T'ao Hung king. Regarding the latter, a distinguished physician, who lived A.D. 452-536, see Botan. sin., I, p. 42. The Pen ts'ao king is the Herbal of the Emperor Shen nung [ibidem, p. 27].\n\nFour geographical names are of frequent occurrence in Kuo P'o's commentaries. They refer to North and Middle China, viz.:\u2014\n\n\u6c5f\u6771 Kiang tung (east of the Great river) is the same as ancient \u5433 Wu, comprising present Che kiang and extending north and west to the Yang tsz'.\n\n\u6c5f\u5357 Kiang nan (south of the Great river).

Faber.\nLack of time has prevented a comparison of each figure in the Chinese works quoted with specimens of plants collected in China and identified at Kew, of which between three and four thousand species are in Dr. Faber's possession. It is to be regretted that the seats of ancient Chinese civilization along the Yellow River have not yet been botanically explored. Botanical investigations in China throw light on some difficult questions relating to Chinese antiquity. Here we need merely note the striking differences between the names of plants in the Shi king and the corresponding ones in the Rh ya. We must assume that an interval of several centuries separates these two works. To the difference between the pronunciation at the period about 300 A.D. and that of the present day, Dr. Bretschneider has alluded. It would be of great interest to learn what plants and trees were known and utilized at certain periods of Chinese history. An insight into the progress of Chinese civilization would by this means be gained.\n\nThe following abbreviations are used in the Notes:\u2014\n\nA. = Journal of C. B. R. A.

The mountain k'in, called also \u767d\u8607 Pai k'in (white k'in), is distinguished from the k'in of the plains by its white colour. [See also infra, 49.]\n\nThe P., XIV, a. 1, identifies the Pai k'in and the Shan k'in with the Tang kui, an aromatic plant the root of which is much esteemed by the Chinese as a medicine. The rough drawing of the Tang kui in the Ch., XXV, 14, seems to represent an umbelliferous plant.\n\nSo moku, V, 5, sub. \u7576\u6b78 Ligusticum acutilobum, S. et Z., according to Maximowicz; same as Apium ternatum with the same Chinese name in Siebold, Syn. plant. orcon. jap., 246.

This umbelliferous plant is also known from Formosa [Index Flore sin., 332]; probably it occurs also in China proper and may be the Tang kui of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, which drug Tatarinov in his Catal. med. sin., 19, supposes to be yielded by Levisticum chinense!

That variety which grows on the mountains is called shu. The Pen ts'ao says one name is Shan ki (mountain thistle), another Shan kiang, another Shan lien. Tao Hung-king [5th century] explains that there are two kinds, the Pai shu, white shu with large hourly, not very fat (fleshy) leaves, and the Chi chi (red) shu, with small leaves, bitter, fleshy. [Comp. infra, 159.]\n\nThe shu ts'ao is also mentioned in the Shan hai king.

It is also called \u9577\u7fc5 ch'ang k'iao. T'ao Hung-\nKING reports that this plant grows abundantly in waste places. The people gather it and employ the juice in dyeing. This is the \u6728\u862d mu lan.\n\nP., XVI, 62, sub. shu wei ts'ao. LI SHI CHEN states that it is also known under the name of \u9ce5\u8349 wu ts'ao (black plant), for its leaves and flowers are much used for dyeing a black color. Spikes similar to those of the \u8eca\u524d ch'e ts'ien (Plantago). There are two kinds, with white or red flowers. One author says that the flowers are purple or violet.\n\nThe plant figured in the Japanese So moku, I, 29-31, sub. \u9f20\u5c3e\u8349, is Salvia japonica, Thbg. [See also Kwa wi, 20.] The rough figure under the same Chinese name found in the Kin huang, XLVI, 28, which is reproduced in the Ch., XIV, 12, may well represent a Salvia.\n\nE., 168, family \u9f20\u5c3e.\n\nThe figure may be of Salvia plebeia.\n\n18.\u2014\u85aa\u85ac Si mi (now pronounced ming); \u5927\u85ac Ta tsi (the great tsi).\n\nKuo P'o:\u2014It resembles the tsi (which is Capsella bursa pastoris, V. infra, 103). It has smaller leaves, and is commonly called \u8001\u85ac lao tsi (old tsi).\n\nHing Ping:\u2014Other names for this plant, given in the Pen ts'ao, are \u85ac\u85ac mie si, \u592a\u85ac t'ai ts'i, \u99ac\u5e78 ma sin.\n\nThe P., XXVII, 5, says that the si ming, or ta tsi, is nearly allied to the tsi (Capsella bursa pastoris), but larger and not so palatable.\n\nIn the Japanese Phon zo, XLVIII, 8-10, the Chinese name \u85ac\u85ac is applied to Thlaspi arvense, L. (the Thlaspi majus of Tabernemontanus), also to Lepidium sativum, L. The plant figured under the above name in the Ch., III, 14, is Capsella h. p., whilst Thlaspi arvense, in the Kin huang, LVIII, 8, as well as in the Ch., V, 4, and in the So moku, XII, 3, bears the Chinese name \u9047\u85e5\u8449 \u014d lan ts'ai. The silicles of the plant are compared by the Chinese authors to\nthe seed-vessels of the elm. [See also Siebold, Syn. plant. avon. jap., 285.] Capsella b. p. and Thlaspi arvense are common Chinese plants.\n\nE., 60, family \u8368 \u85dc and family \u85dc.\n\nThe name si mi also occurs E., 271, as a synonym of \u85dc.\n\n19.\u2014\u85e4 T'\u00fc; \u864e \u679d Hu chang (tiger's cane).

Used for dyeing a red colour.\n\nHing Ping:\u2014T'ao Hung-king says that according to the Pen ts'ao this plant grows abundantly in waste places. It has the appearance of the \u5927 \u99ac \u85dc ta ma liao (great horse's Polygonum). Spotted stem, round leaves.\n\nIn the P., XVI, 83, this plant is described as a Polygonum, the leaves of which resemble those of the apricot. Stem covered with spots, wherefore the plant is also called \u6591 \u679d pan chang, variegated cane.\n\nCh., XI, 91; Bad figure. So moku, VII, 78, \u864e \u679d, Polygonum cuspidatum, S. et Z. In China the above Chinese name seems to be applied to another species of Polygonum.\n\nE., 104, gives \u85dc as a synonym of \u85dc [v. infra, 24, 150, 209].\n\nE., 164, family \u864e \u679d contains three figures of very distinct plants, reproductions of S., IX, 39, but the name \u85dc does not appear.

Most Rh ja editions have \u85dc, but \u85dc ju is preferable, as in E. P., 23, 14. B., \u72fc \u5c3e \u8349 Scirpus cyperinus, Kth. The figure in E. is of a graminea.\n\nThe figure in Rh ja has the character \u72fc for \u85dc.\n21.\u2014\u74e0\u679c Hu si; \u74e2 Pan.\n\nKuo P'o explains, \u74e2\u4e2d\u74e2, which Legge [Shi king] translates \"the section of a melon,\" but it seems rather to mean the pulp of a calabash, or melon. The character pan is thus defined in the Shuo wen.\n\nHing Ping quotes the Shi king. [v. infra, 384.]\n\nThe corresponding drawing in the Rh ya represents a calabash.\n\nE., 47, family \u74e2.\n\nFor \u74e2 the Shi king has \u74e2. Not the pulp is meant but the kernels, \"Teeth like melon kernels.\" Calabash is more correct than melon, according to the figure in E. [v. infra, 384].\n\n22.\u2014\u8339\u8514 Ju lu; \u8305\u8514 Mao shou.\n\nKuo P'o:\u2014Now it is called \u85dc ts'ien and used for dyeing a dark red (\u7dcb) colour.\n\nHing Ping quotes the Shi king. [v. infra, 393.]\n\nThe plant \u8305 shou, mentioned in the Shan hai king, is, according to Kuo P'o's explanation, the same as mao shou.\n\nAccording to Li Sun, quoted by K'ung Ying-ta, mao shou is the same as \u85dc ts'ien, Rubia cordifolia, L. The Shuo wen says that this plant grows from human blood.\n\nE., 104, family \u85dc.\n\nThe figure is the same as in S., II, 4, and bad.\n\nP., 18 b, 19.\n\nThe name ju lu is from the Shi king.\n\nOne synonym, mentioned in E., is \u5730\u8840 Earth-blood.\n\n23.\u2014\u679c\u84cf\u4e4b\u5be6.

The Pen ts'ao king states that the leaves of this plant\nresemble those of the kua (gourd or melon); they are of a dark green colour. It is a trailing plant, and flowers in the 6th month; in the 7th month it produces a gourd-like fruit.\n\nThis is a Trichosanthes.

Its leaves resemble those of the \u82e6\u82e3 k'u k\u00fc (Lactuca) but are smaller; if broken they exude a milky juice. Yellow flowers, resembling those of the ku or Aster.

But they were mistaken. As jung is likewise a term for foreigners [western barbarians] they concluded that jung shu and hu tou are the same. Cheng Huan and Sun Yen identified the jung shu correctly with the \u5927\u8c46 ta tou or great bean. [Comp. infra, 355, Shi king.]\n\nThe ta tou is the Soja hispida, Moench, or soy bean. The hu tou, or foreign bean, is the Faba sativa, or common bean, one of the cultivated plants introduced from Western Asia.\ninto China, in the second century B.C., by the famous general Chang K'ien.\n\nFigure of the jung shu in the Rh ya a leguminous plant.\n\nE., 36, 12, family \u8c46.\n\nBoth Jung shu and Hu tou are given as synonyms of \u8c46\u8c46.

[v. infra, 386, Thladiantha dubia, Bge.]\n\nSome of the ancient authors quoted identify the yen with the plant mentioned Rh ya, 152, q.v.\n\n35.\u2014\u83ca\u982d Lie chen; \u83ca\u9996 Shi shou (pig's head).\n\nKuo P'o:\u2014In the Pen ts'ao this plant is also called \u83ca\u982d chi lu (pig's head) and \u87f2\u862d shan chu lan. In Kiang tung it is now commonly called shi shou and employed in boiling the pupa of the silkworm [to kill it].\n\nHing Ping:\u2014A medicinal plant. In the Pen ts'ao it has, besides the names already mentioned, the following names: \u5929\u540d\u7cbe tien ming tsing, \u9ea5\u53e5\u8591 mai ku kiang, \u8766\u8591\u8591 hia ma lan, \u738b\u9580\u7cbe wang men tsing. According to the Pie lu, it is fragrant and known also under the name of \u5929\u8591\u7cbe tien man tsing. The southern people call it \u5730\u8525 ti sung (earth cabbage). Its taste is sweet and bitter. It resembles the \u85cd lan (indigo plant).\n\nIn the P., XV, 68, this plant is noticed under the name of \u5929\u540d\u7cbe tien ming tsing with the above synonyms. It is said to have small, fragrant, yellow flowers resembling the ku flowers (Aster, Chrysanthemum).\n\nIn the So moku, XV, 62, under the name of \u5929\u540d\u7cbe, is a drawing of Carpesium abrotanoides, L., (Compositae), which agrees well with the figure given under the same Chinese name in the Ch., XI, 16.\nE., 174, family \u5929\u540d\u7cbe. The figure apparently from S., II, 2, not good. Sm., 12, Amaranthus tristis is doubtful. Carpesium abrotanoides, L., can also not be accepted exclusively, for among the 23 synonyms we find \u7a2e\u7a40, S., IV, 34, P., XV, 72, which is Siegesbeckia orientalis, L. according to B., C. 395, A., XV, 70 and Jap., 2078. [Comp.

The P., XV, 57, refers the above names to an Iris. [v. infra, 467.]\n\nE., 138, family \u5730\u8518.\n\nThis is a synonym of \u834a [supra, 9].\n\n37.\u2014\u85ba; \u61f7\u7f8a. Unknown to the Chinese commentators.\n\n38.\u2014\u85ba Kiao \u725b\u8518 niu k'in (k'i).\n\nKuo P'o:\u2014It is now called \u99ac\u8518 ma k'in. It has small pointed leaves resembling the leaves of the \u82a5 k'in (Celery, also Enanthe stolonifera). It can be eaten.\n\nHing Ping:\u2014A vegetable. Seeds used in medicine. The Pen ts'ao says that this plant grows in marshes. It resembles the \u9b3c\u91dd kui chen (\"devil's needle,\" Bidens) and also the \u83dc\u83dc tien ts'ai (Beta). Flowers of a light green colour, seeds dark yellow, resembling those of the \u9632\u98a8\u5b50 fang feng tsz (Stenocelium, Umbellifera).\n\nP., XXVI, 61, ma k'in. Figure in the Ch., III, 44, an umbelliferous plant.\n\nE., 65, family \u82b1 [v. infra, 116].\n\nThe synonyms given to 38 and 116 are all united, E., 65.\n\nStenocelium is Siler divaricatum, Bth. [v. Index Fl. S. p. 332.]\n\n39.\u2014\u85ba tu \u852c lo (lu) fei (pei).\n\nKuo P'o:\u2014The character \u852c stands for \u852c fu. The lo fei or lo fu is akin to the \u71d5\u83c1 wu tsing (Rape), but has violet flowers and a great (long) root. Its common name is \u85a4\u85ba po tu.\nHing Ping.\u2014Sun Yen calls it \u7d2b\u82b1\u83d8 tsz' hua sung (cabbage with violet flowers). Another name is \u6e29\u83d8 wen sung. Large root. Now its common name is \u863f\u8514 lo p'o.\n\nIn the Fang yen the same plant is compared to the \u82a5 kiai (mustard plant) from which it is distinguished by its violet flowers. In Eastern \u9c81 Lu (Shan tung) it is also known by the name of \u83dc\u9060 la t'u. The commentary adds that its seeds are as large as small beans.\n\nThe plant here spoken of is the Radish, Raphanus sativus, L. It has violet flowers and large seeds; its common name is nowadays \u863f\u8514 lo p'o, which appears first in Chinese books in the 9th century. In the Kuang yun Dictionary, which was compiled in that period, it is stated that this name was in use in the State of \u79e6 Ts'in (Shen si, Eastern Kan su). In the T'ung Pen ts'ao, published two centuries earlier, we first meet with another name for the radish, \u83dc\u670d lai fu. Under this name it is described by Li Shih-chen in the P., XXVI, 41, and figured Ch., IV, 15.\n\nIn K\u00e6mpfer's Amoen. exot., 823, Japanese plants, we read \u83dc\u670d Rai fuku, vulgo \"Daikon,\" Raphanus major orbicularis vel radice permagna oblonga. With the same Chinese name the radish is figured in the So moku, XII, 27, 28.\n\nAs the radish is mentioned in the Rh ya it may be assumed that it has been cultivated in China from remote antiquity. From China its cultivation spread over the neighbouring countries, where the people generally adopted also the Chinese name of the plant. The Anamese and Malay call it lobac. (See Loureiro's Flora cochin., 481; Watson's Native and Scient. Names of Eastern Asiat. Plants.) In Tibetan it is la phug (Jeschke, Tibet. Dictionary); in Mongol and Kalmyk lao pang, lo bin, but also turma. The latter name is, it seems, derived from the Persian appellation turup, used to designate the radish.\nE., 70, family \u841d\u8514, four different plants are figured, among them Raphanus sativus, a Crucifera and Daucus carota, an Umbellifera. The third plate is doubtful. H., 251, says that Shan lo po is a common name for Phytolacca acinosa, Rox. The figure, showing a turnip-like root and large digitate leaves, must be intended for something else. There are 20 synonyms enumerated.\n\nPr., 88. C., 688 and 751.\nA., XV, 137, Sm., 223.\n\n40.\u2014\u6ecc\u704c unknown to the Chinese commentators.\n\n41.\u2014\u8335 Siu; \u829d Chi.\n\nKuo P'o:\u2014The chi flowers three times in one year. It is a felicitous plant.\n\nHing Ping:\u2014The Lun heng [first century] says that the chi grows in the ground and absorbs the vapours of the earth. It is therefore considered a felicitous plant. The \u79ae Li says, \"when the ruler is charitable, then the chi grows.\"\n\nI have not been able to find Hing Ping's quotation in the Li classics, but a similar sentence is found in the Shui ying t'\u00fc ki [6th century] quoted in the K.D. The Shuo wen defines \u829d by \u795e\u8349, \"divine herb.\" Williams, in his Dictionary, 811, makes siu chi to be one name, designating a gynandrous plant. The text of the Rh ya, however, gives siu as a synonym of chi, regarding which Williams, 53, correctly states that it is a Fungus. The corresponding figure in the Rh ya seems to represent a branching Fungus, the \u9732\u829d ling chi, or felicitous chi, which is sold in the Peking apothecary shops. It is orange colonred, of a ligneous structure and branched. The ling chi has been figured and described by Father Cibot under the name of Agaric ramifi\u00e9, in the M\u00e9moires conc. les Chinois, IV, p. 500. [See also Grosier, la Chine, III, 256.]\n\nThe P., XXVIII, 35, identifies the ling chi with the \u77f3\u8033 shi rh (stone mushroom) but gives no details about it.\nEXPLANATION OF NAMES OF HERBACEOUS PLANTS.\n\nAm\u00e6n, exot., 832, \u829d naba, i.e., Fungus campestris esculentus.

Sun Yen says nearly the same. K'ung An kuo, in commenting upon the Shu king, defines t'ang by \"large bamboo.\" [v. infra, 564.] Drawing, Rh ya, bamboo.

All these and similar species are probably meant.\n\n[E., 162, family \u5c04\u5e72.\n\nThe synonym \u6241\u7af9 (without \u5341) occurs; this is Belemcanda chinensis, Lam., H. 370, C., 1020, and has nothing to do with the classics.]\n\n55.\u2014\u85cf Chen; \u5bd2\u6d46 Han tsiang (cooling juice).\n\nKuo Po:\u2014This plant is now called \u9178\u6d46\u8349 suan tsiang ts'ao (acid juice). In Kiang tung they call it \u82e6\u8535 k'u chen (bitter chen).\n\nHing Ping:\u2014The Pen ts'ao terms it \u918b\u6d46 ts'iu tsiang (vinegar juice) T'ao Hung-king states that it is a common plant near dwelling-places. The leaves are eaten. The fruit is a capsule (bladder) within which is a berry of a yellowish red colour, resembling a plum.\n\nP., XVI, 33, sub. suan tsiang. Li Shi-chen states that the red fruit is enclosed within a five-angled bladder resembling a lantern. This agrees well with the fruit of the winter cherry, Physalis Alkekengi, L., a common plant in Northern China, called also teng lung ts'ao (lantern plant) and hung ku niang (red girl). This plant is well figured under the above Chinese name suan tsiang in the Ch., XI, 48, and in the So moku, III, 43.\nE., 160, family \u9178\u6d46.\nThe figure is a good drawing of *Physalis Alkekengi*, L.\nS., II, 40.

The fruit resembles that of the \u5c71\u8331\u8438 Shan chu yu (Cornus). It is also called \u85e4 Ling. In Kuan si (present Shen si) it has the above name Kie kou.\n\nHing Ping:\u2014T'ao Hung-king, in explaining the Pen ts'ao, states that the plant in question has leaves resembling those of the \u8336\u8c46 Kiang tou (Cassia?). The seeds resemble a horse's hoof, whence the name \u9a6c\u8e44\u82f1\u660e Ma ti kue ming. The Shuo wen calls it \u85e4 Ling, the Kuang ya \u7f8a\u8e44\u82b1 Yang chi chu. In \u695a Chu (Hu kuang) they call it \u83dc K'i, in \u79e6 Ts'in it is called Kie kou.\n\nP., XVI, 41, Kue ming. Li Shi-chen states that there are two kinds of Kue ming, one of them is called Ma ti kue ming (horse's hoof Kue ming). Its stem is 3 or 4 feet high, the leaves (leaflets) are larger than those of the mu su (*Medicago sativa*); they are narrow at the base and enlarge towards the summit. In daytime they are open, at night they all fold together, two and two. In autumn the flowers, with five petals of a pale yellow, appear. They are followed by long pods resembling those of the \u8c46\u8c46 Kiang tou (*Dolichos sinensis*). They contain many dark green seeds resembling a horse's hoof. The other kind is called \u85e4\u8292 \u82f1\u660e Kiang mang kue ming. It resembles the former, but the leaves are pointed, resemble those of *Sophora japonica* and do not fold together at night. Dark yellow flowers, small pods like a little finger, small seeds resembling those of *Hibiscus abelmoschus*.\n\nThe name of the last-described is more commonly written \u671b\u6c5f\u5357 Wang kiang nan. Kiu huang, LIII, 22, and Ch., XI, 30. The plant figured there is a Cassia. At\nPeking Wang kiang nan is the Cassia Sophera, L. The plants described by Li Shi-chen under the above names are without doubt two species of Cassia, but what Kuo P'o states regarding the Kue ming does not agree.\n\nIn the So moku, VIII, 2, \u6c5f\u5357 is Cassia Tora, L., and 3, \u6c5f\u5357 Cassia occidentalis, L.\n\nE., 131, family \u6c5f\u5357.\n\nTwo different figures, which are taken from S., II, 3, where three can be seen, one of them may be Cassia Tora, L., Sm., 54; C., 269 = 1341, Cassia Sophera, also A., XV, 148.\n\nThe other figure cannot be meant for a leguminosa.\n\nE., 179, family \u6c5f\u5357 cannot be the same, its synonym is\n\nDatura alba, N. & E., by Pr.; C., 894, (302); as Datura Metel, L., by A., XV, 164; as Hyoscyamus niger, by Sm., 29, 115, (also Andromeda, 84). The figure is neither one nor the other, nor can it mean a leguminosa. As \u9ec4\u675c\u9d51 yellow Azalea is among the synonyms, it may mean Rhododendron chinense.\n\nE., 78, 15, has a good figure of \u6c5f\u5357, a Cassia.\n\nJap., 2060, gives this Chinese name to Senecio japonicus, Schultz.\n\n57.\u2014\u71d5\u9ea6 Wu i; \u85dc\u9ea6 Shu ts'iang.\n\nKuo P'o:\u2014It is also called \u767d\u9ea6 Pai k'ui (white Blitum, see 107).\n\nHing Ping refers to the \u71d5\u9ea6 Wu i, mentioned in the Pen ts'ao, about which see 263.\n\n58.\u2014\u8534 Tie; \u9ebb Cho; \u5176\u7d21\u8534.\n\nAccording to She jen, Sun Yen and Kuo P'o, a \u5c0f\u74dc, small gourd or melon, which is also figured in the corresponding plate.\n\nV. infra, 383, Shi king.\n\n59.\u2014\u85f7 Sho; \u85dc\u854e Fu ts'z\u00e9.\n\nKuo P'o:\u2014This plant grows in low fields, resembles the \u9f8d\u9808 Lung su (a rush, v. infra, 455), but is more slender.\nIts root resembles the end of a finger, is of a black colour, and edible.\n\n**Hing Ping:**\u2014The people boil it.\n\nIn the *P.*, XXXIII, 29, the above names are identified with the \u9ce5\u828b Wu yu (black taro) which is also called \u5730\u6817 Ti li (ground chestnut) and \u85dc\u52dd Pi ts'i. The latter name at Peking is applied to the black tubers of the *Scirpus tuberosus*, Roxb., (*Eleocharis tuberosa*) which is extensively cultivated all over China.

In Kiang nan they eat it to remove flatulence.\n\nAccording to *P.*, XV, 47, this is the same as the \u82e6\u83dc *K'iu* or bitter *Yao*, first mentioned in the *Pie lu*, and represented in *Ch.*, XIV, 6, as a spiny plant (only leaves).\n\n*So moku*, XV, 41, \u82e6\u83dc *Cnicus japonicus*, Maxim. *Index Flora sin.*, p. 461.\n\n*E.*, 161, family \u82e6\u83dc.

There is a variety of it with the leaves not purple-coloured and not fragrant. There is also a wild species growing in marshes and called \u6c34\u8607 *Shui su* (water *su*) or \u96de\u8607 *Ki su* (cock's *su*).\n\n*P.*, XIVb, 94, \u8607 *Su*. LI SHI-CHEN distinguishes two sorts of *Su*. One of them, called \u7d2b\u8607 *Ts' su* (purple *su*) has a square stem; roundish-pointed, toothed leaves, purple on both sides when the plant grows in rich soil, purple only underneath when it grows in poor soil. It is very fragrant. Young leaves eaten as a vegetable, also pickled with plums. They are also used to prepare a beverage. The other kind, with its leaves white on both sides, not\nfragrant, is called \u767d\u8607 Pai su (white su) or \u8525 Jen. An oil is expressed from its seeds. [But it seems the Tsz' su also produces an oil].\n\nTwo distinct labiate plants are figured under the above names in the Ch., XXV, 25, the Jen or Pai su, the oil yielding, and 27, 29, the Su or Tsz' su or purple coloured.\n\nAmaen. exot., 911, \u8334 dsin, vulgo je et fakkuso.

Siebold, Plant. japon. acon., 189. Acynos siso, \u7d2b\u8607 Ocimum crispum, Thbg., variat foliis purpurascentibus.\n\nThus in Japan the latter Chinese name, Tsz' su (purple su) is applied both to Perilla arguta and Ocimum crispum. I may observe that Thunberg is wrong in identifying [Flora jap., 248] his O. crispum with K\u00e4mpfer's siso or murasaki [Amaen. exot., 784], for this latter is Lithospermum erythrorhizon, S. & Z. [Comp. infra, 142].\n\nAccording to Loureiro, Flora cochin., 446, the Tsu su (Tsz' su) in Southern China, is Melissa cretica, L. He says: \"tota planta rubrofusca, mixto odore Pulegii, et eimicum imbuta. Foliis recentibus vescuntur indigenae in acetariis.\" This is probably not Melissa cretica. Loureiro's Dendidia nankinensis, sin. kiain nan tsu su (Tsz' su of Kiang nan), l.c., 448, odore et colore Melissae cretic\u00e6, is, according to Bentham, Flora hongk., 276, Perilla ocimoides, var. crispa.\nThe labiate plant, cultivated at Peking under the name of Su (vulgo su tsz') for the oil expressed from its seeds, is Perilla ocimoides. This plant has an unpleasant, powerful smell.\n\nAccording to Henry, Chinese Names of Plants, 395 and 512, P. ocimoides is much cultivated for its oil in Hu pei, and is called there Su ma (su hemp). A variety with red flowers is Tsz' su.\n\nThe \u6c34\u8607 Shui su, mentioned by a commentator on the Rh ya, is likewise a Labiate, but I am not prepared to say to what genus it belongs. See P., XIVb, 97. Ch., XXV, 14. Phon zo, XII, 14.\n\nE., 58, family \u8607, contains 4 figures and 25 names.\n\nThe first figure, \u7d2b\u8607, is Perilla ocimoides, L., in Jap., 1588, P. arguta, Bth. The figure for \u6c34\u8607, if meant for a Labiate, is not a success; it may be a Scrophularinea or an Acanthacea. The figure of \u83d6 may indicate another Perilla. In Jap., 1589, P. ocimoides.\n\nC., 1199, 1202, 1203. S., X, 15.\n\n65.\u2014\u820a Se; \u8655\u84fc Yu liao.\n\nKuo P'o:-\u2014Same as the \u6fa4\u84fc Tse liao (Marsh Polygonum). Hing Ping refers to the Shi king \u8336\u84fc T'u liao [v. infra, 365] which Mao explains by \u6c34\u8349 Shui ts'ao (water-plant).\n\nThe drawing in the Rh ya may well be intended for a Polygonum.\n\nP., XVI, 78, \u6c34\u84fc Shui liao (Water Polygonum), where the above names of the Rh ya are given as synonyms.

Same Chinese name, So moku, VII, 62, and Phon zo, XX, 3, Polygonum figured, not determined.\nOf the two figures the first called \u5927\u8518 is not a Polygon, but probably *Psilopeganum sinense*, Hemsl., (Rutaceae), 21 names are given, among them also \u7d05, etc., from the Rh ya, [v. infra, 102].

In the reign of the Han Emperor Ho ti (A.D. 89-106), in the district of \u4efb\u57ce Jen ch'eng (now Yen chou fu, in Shan tung), such a black double-kernelled millet was reaped; more than 3 hu of it were gathered.\nHing Ping.\u2014This double-kernelled millet was used in olden time for making the spirits offered in the ancestral worship of princes, it being regarded as an unusual thing.\n\nV. infra, 342.\n\n71.\u2014\u7a32 T'\u00fc; \u7a3b Tao.\n\nKuo P'o.\u2014Nowadays in \u6c9b\u570b P'e\u0131 kuo (northern part of present An hui Province) the people use the term \u7a32 (to designate Rice).\n\nHing Ping quotes the Shi king, Li ki, Shuo wen and the Tsz lin [3rd century]. The latter states \u7a17 No is the name for the \u7c98\u7a3b Nien tao (glutinous rice) and \u7a3b Keng is the [common] rice without the glutinous quality. In the Pen ts'ao these two kinds are called \u7cef\u7c73 keng mi and \u7a3b\u7c73 tao mi.\n\nThe Rh ya makes t'\u00fc and tao to be the same thing, as does also the Shuo wen. But tao is nowadays a general term for rice, whilst t'\u00fc, according to the dictionary Tsi y\u00fcn [11th century] is the same as no or glutinous rice. [v. infra, 337, 338, about Rice mentioned in the Classics.] The terms tao and t'\u00fc occur also in the Shan hai king, \u7a3b\u7c73 tao mi and \u7a2e\u7c73 t'\u00fc mi, used for the sacrifices offered to the mountain spirits.\n\nE., 25, family \u7a3b.\n\nP., 22, 29.

Its stem resembles that of the \u845b Ko (Pachyrhizus); its leaves are orbicular and covered with hairs, the fruit is shaped like an ear-ring. It is of a reddish colour. The plant grows in a bushy manner.\n\nThe P., XVIII, b, 31, identifies the kui mu of the Rh ya with the \u767d\u82f1 Pai ying, a climbing plant with 5 lobed tomentose leaves; fruit globular, resembling that of the \u9f8d\u8475 Lung k'ui (Solanum nigrum), but of a dark red colour.

T'ao Hung-king states that the people use it as a vegetable for soup.\n\nP., XXVII, 6, fan lu, a creeping plant. The drawing in Ch., IV, 7, s.n., agrees with the figure; So moku, VIII, 65, under \u7d2b\u8607, which is Stellaria neglecta, Weihe. But the plant \u96de\u8178\u8349, is kept apart in P., XXVII, 7, in Ch., IV, 8, and in the Japanese botanical works. In the So moku it is Eritrichium pedunculare, A.D.C.\n\nE., 144, family \u7d2b\u8607, the figure may be of a Stellaria.\n\n82.\u2014\u96e2\u5357 Li nan; \u6d3b\u8373 Huo t'o. [Comp. also 143.]\n\nIn the Shan hai king this plant is repeatedly mentioned under the name of \u51a0\u812b K'ou t'o. Kuo P'o explains that it is an herbaceous plant of the southern provinces, which grows to the height of more than ten feet, and has large leaves resembling those of the \u8377 Ho (Lotus flower). The pith of the stem is very white. The people of \u96f2 Ling and \u6842 Kui [Hu nan] cultivate it. It is called \u704c Kuan, and grows like a tree.\n\nIn P., XVIIIb, 28, the above names, found in the Rh ya and Shan hai king, are referred to the \u901a\u812b\u6728 T'ung t'o mu. Li Shu-ch'en explains this name, saying that the pith is obtained by stripping off the rind. T'ung\u2014to go through; t'o\u2014to peel off. Ch'en Ts'ang-k'i [first half of the 8th century] states that the t'ung t'o tree grows on the\nsides of the mountains. The leaves resemble those of the \u9ebb Pi ma (Ricinus communis). The stem contains a beautiful light, white pith, which is used by women for making fancy articles. Its common name is \u901a\u8349 Ts'ung ts'ao. Under this latter name Ch., VIII, 64, gives a good drawing of the Aralia (Fatsia) papyrifera, (Hooker) the pith of which, as is now well known, yields the so-called \"rice-paper.\" This plant was long known as growing plentifully in Formosa. [Comp. Kew Journ. Bot., IV (1852), p. 53 tt. 1, 2.] Recently Dr. A. Henry discovered it also in Hu pei [Chinese Names of Plants, 488, ts'ung ts'ao; Ind. Florae sin., 341]. E. H. Parker [China Rec., IX, 327] reports that the rice-paper plant, ts'ung ts'ao, is produced in Sung k'uan (Sz' ch'unan, near the Kneichou frontier). The pith paper in China is chiefly used for manufacturing artificial flowers for women's hair. Besides this, the Chinese painters execute brilliant paintings on it. Aralia papyrifera is an herbaceous plant, but it has sometimes a tree-like appearance.\n\n\u901a\u8349 Akelia quinata, Deen., and \u901a\u8131\u6728 Fatsia horrida, (Smith), are found in Japan.

The plant is covered with hairs. In Kiang tung it is now called yin jen. The people gather and pickle it; they boil it also for food.\nThis plant is not noticed in the Pen ts'ao kang mu.\n\nE., 143, family \u9752\u8525 [v. supra, 45], yin jen occurs as a synonym.\n\n85.\u2014\u83cc Yu; \u8513\u4e8e Man yu.\n\nKuo P'o:\u2014This is a water-plant, also called \u8377\u4e8e Hien yu. In Kiang tung they call it yu.\n\nP., XVI, 85, and Ch., XIV, 33, consider the yu plant of the Rh yu to be the same as the \u7a2e yu, which ancient authors describe as a marsh or water-plant like silk floss; long leaves which are eaten by horses; stem with joints. It has a fetid smell. Williams, Dictionary, 1113, thinks that it may be a Potamogeton.\n\nThe Shuo wen keeps the two characters yu distinct. According to this dictionary \u83cc is another term for \u6f02 (to strain spirits) and \u7a2e (a plant growing by the edge of the water).\n\nThe stinking plant yu is mentioned in the Tso chuan, 141, [B.C. 655], in an oracular passage, saying:\u2014there is a fragrant herb and a noisome one, and ten years hence the noisomeness will continue (\u4e00\u85a6\u4e00\u85a6\u5341\u5e74\u5c1a\u7336\u6709\u81ed).\n\nSiebold, Icon. jap., ined., VI, \u7a2e Ph\u00e6noides japonica (Clerodendron).

There are many more such cases, all specially inexplicable by the commentators.\n\n88.\u2014\u51fa\u9678 Ch'u sui; \u8568\u83dc Ku shu.\n\nKuo P'o:\u2014It resembles the \u571f\u83cc T'u kan (a mushroom) and is produced within the \u8607\u8349 Ku tsao [Hydropyrum latifolium. V. infra, 350]. The people of Kiang tung eat it. It is sweet and mucilaginous.\n\nThe corresponding figure of the Rh ya represents a mushroom.\n\nE., 40, family \u8611, makes the two terms simply synonyms. It is possible that the young sprouts of Hydropyrum were considered to have the quality of mushrooms. Whether a peculiar mushroom grows among H's should be ascertained from a professional botanist.\n\nThe two terms are from the Rh ya. \u8611 is mentioned in the Li ki. P., 19, 17; 23, 15. \u8611\u5b50 is mentioned E., 52, among the \u8611 or mushrooms.\n\n89.\u2014\u65b0\u82b1 K'in (k'i) ch'i; \u85e4\u71d5 Mi wu.\n\nKuo P'o:\u2014This is a fragrant herb with small leaves, resembling the \u85b0 Wei. HUAI NAN-TSZ [2nd century B.C.] says that it resembles the \u86c7\u7240 She ch'uang [an umbelliferous plant, Selinum or Cnidium]. The mi wu is mentioned in the Shan hai king.\n\nHING PING:\u2014Another name is \u8096\u9b1a\u82d7 Kung k'uing miao. In the Pen ts'ao it is also called \u85b0\u71d5 Wei wu and \u6c5f\u96e2 Kiang li.

It grows in the mountains, in damp places. The root resembles that of the \u7d30\u8f9b Si sin (*Asarum*, r. infra, 414).\n\nThe tu heng is mentioned in the Shan hai king.

Described as a fragrant umbelliferous plant, the seeds of which are used in medicine. The Kiu huang, XLVI, 21, and the Ch., XXV, 4, figure under the above name an umbelliferous plant.\n\nAccording to Tatarinov, Catal. med. sin., 52, She ch'uang ts'z are the seeds of a Cnidium; from Hanbury's investigations (Science Papers, 233), it appears that they belong to Cnidium Monnierii, Cuss., (Selinum Monnieri, L.).

P., XVIIIa, 29, ts'z wei, also ling tiao and \u9686\u82b1 Ling siao. The ancient authors describe it as a plant, wild in the mountains and cultivated, climbing on trees; serrate leaves; flowers of the size of the flowers of the \u725b K'ien niu (Pharbitis) as large as a cup, orange coloured, dotted; the fruit is a pod three inches long; the seeds resemble the fruit of the elm (winged).\n\nLing siao at Peking is the name for Tecoma (Bignonia) grandiflora, Del., with which the above description agrees. The flowers are much used as a medicine. Ch., XXII, 25, good drawing.\n\nAmoen. exot., 856, \u9686\u82b1, njotsio is Bignonia grandiflora, the same figured in Banks' Icones K\u00e4mpferi, tab. 21.

Its top is called \"small plant\" (\u5176\u4e0a\u8b02\u4e4b\u5c0f\u8349).\n\nHing Ping:\u2014It is a medicinal plant. In the Pen ts'ao it is also called \u7d30\u8349 Si ts'ao (fine plant), the leaves are called \u5c0f\u8349 Siao ts'ao (small plant).

This at Peking is a name for the Lime tree, Tilia, not mentioned in P. [Comp. also above 6.]\nThe \u6a2b kia tree is likewise not described in P., but a rough figure of it, which is not sufficient for its recognition, is given in the Kiu huang, LIV, 36, and reproduced in\nEXPLANATION OF NAMES OF TREES.\n\nCh., XXXIV, 21. The kia tree is mentioned by T'ao Hung-king [5th century] who in his note regarding Ginseng quotes a Corean poem in praise of the Ginseng, saying that the kia tree and the Ginseng have mutual sympathy. T'ao adds that the kia is a tree resembling the \u6850 (Paulownia), growing very high and giving an extensive shade. [See P., XIIa, 11, article \u5165\u53c2 Jen shen]. Reference is made to the kia tree in Grosier's La Chine, II, 289. It is described in K.K.F.P., LXXXI, 19, as a tree with large leaves collected together like a fan, the bark of which furnishes textile fibres fit for making fishing nets. The Cheng te fu chi reports the same with regard to the tuan tree or tilia. It seems that authors frequently confound the characters kia and tuan.\n\nThe above character \u6850 I is also written \u6850 and also read T'o.

It denotes a tree which resembles the \u679d sung (Pinus) and grows in Kiangnan. Its wood is fit for shipbuilding, coffins, pillars; it is veined, does not decay.\n\nP., XXXIV, 12, \u679d shan (sha). This character, another form of the shan in the Rh ya, is first met with in the Pie la [5th century]. The name is also written \u6c99\u6728 sha mu. The ancient authors say that this is a large tree yielding excellent timber and resin; leaves like needles, sharp pointed, but flattened, evergreen. It is common in Middle China. Li Shih-chen states that there are several kinds of the shan tree, one of them introduced from Japan. One kind has a red wood and is very tough and resinous; the white shan is of a looser structure, and when dry becomes beautifully veined.\n\nThe shan tree of the ancient Chinese authors is without doubt the Cunninghamia sinensis, R. Brown, a common and very valuable coniferous tree of Middle and Southern China. Comp. Mr. Th. Sampson's interesting note regarding this tree in Notes and Queries on China and Japan, 1868, p. 52. But it seems that nowadays the name shan in China is applied also to Cryptomeria japonica, Don., and perhaps to other coniferous trees. Dr. Henry informs me that Cryptomeria japonica in Hupei, where it occurs wild, is one of the numerous \u679d sha trees of the Chinese.\n\nIn Japan, where Cunninghamia sinensis occurs only cultivated, the Chinese character \u679d denotes Cryptomeria japonica. See Phon za, LXXIX, 19, 20; Sieb. & Zucc., Flora japon., I, 43, tab. 124; Siebold, Syn. plant. econ. jap., 65.\n\nIn Ch., XXXIII, 58, the coniferous tree represented under \u679d is neither Cryptomeria nor Cunninghamia.

The first name is explained by the timber resembling that of the pine, the trunk that of the poplar. CHEN TS'ANG KU [8th century] says that the tree grows in Kiangnan. The figure given of the liang ts'e' mu in the Kin huang, LIV, 9, is worthless, only leaves figured; it is said there to grow in the mountains of Mi hien in Honan.

[The Shuo wen also says that it resembles the ch'eng.]\n\nHing Ping:\u2014It is mentioned in the Yu kung of the Shu king, also in the Lu shi ch'un ts'in [3rd century B.C.] The T'ung Pen ts'ga says the yu fruit has a thick peel of a sweet taste, whilst the peel of the k\u016b or common orange is bitter. Its flesh resembles that of the orange. There are sweet and acid varieties of the yu. The acid yu is called \u80e1\u67d1 hu kan.

Confused description of the tree, which is also called \u6989\u67f3 k\u016b liu. Li Shih-chien says it furnishes a dark red timber, good for making boxes. The T'ung chi [12th century] states that this tree is a sort of \u6986 yu (elm); its seed-vessels resemble those of the elm, having the shape of small coins. The country people gather the leaves of this tree and use them as tea.\n\nThe k\u016b tree figured in Ch., XXXIII, 63, is, according to Henry, l.c., 247, Pterocarya stenoptera; it seems to me that the figure represents rather a Rhus.\n\nSiebold, Syn. plant. \u00e6on. jap., 170, \u6989 Ulmus keaki or Zelkova keaki, Sieb., Planera japonica, Miq.

Its fruit is of the size of the end of a finger, of a red colour, resembling a small \u68d5 nai fruit [c. 286]; edible.\n\nLi Shih-chen in P., XXX, 12, identifies this with the \u5c71\u6942 shan chu or \u5c71\u88e1\u7d05 shan li hung. It is described as a small, thorny tree with five lobed leaves and red, occasionally yellow, fruit resembling the \u6797\u6a8e lin kin (crab-apple). It is edible.\n\nThe above names are applied in China to several species of Crataegus or hawthorn. The shan li hung of Peking is the red fruit of Crataegus pinnatifida, Bge., collected in the mountains and made into an excellent sweetmeat. See the drawings in the Kin huang, LV, 8, and Ch., XXXII, 39. According to Henry, l. c., 411, in Hupei Cr. pinnatifida is called shan cha.\n\nIn the Phon zo, LXIII, 16, \u5c71\u6942 is Crataegus cuneata, S. & Z., and \u7f8a\u676d\u5b50 Cr. pinnatifida.\n\nE., 284, family \u5c71\u6942, with good figure of Crategus.\n\nC., 1682.

As to the nai, it is also written \u6838 [c. 244], this name is still in use and applied to a fruit which seems to be common in Middle China. Williams, Dict., 613, calls it a kind of bullace or large yellow plum, sour yet edible. The character nai is found in the Shuo wen and explained there: name of a fruit.\n\nP., XXX, 15, has an account of the nai. It is mentioned in the Pie lo. Tao Hung-king says:\u2014This fruit is found in Kiangnan, but it is more plentiful in the Northern States, where the fruit is dried for food. It is, however, not profitable to man. It resembles the \u6797\u6a8e lin k'in [crab apple, c. 301] but is smaller. Li Shih-ch'en also says that the nai resembles the crab apple, but is larger. There are red, white and green varieties. It is grown especially in the Western Provinces. Li Shih-ch'en states farther that the Sanscrit name for the nai is \u983b\u5a46 p'iu p'o, which latter name has also been adopted.\nin the Northern Province. According to Stan. Julien (M\u00e9thode pour d\u00e9chiffrer les noms sanscrits des livres chinois, p. 171) pin po is an equivalent of vimba, which has been identified with Bryonia grandis, a cucurbitaceous plant. Dr. Eitel, however, in his Handbook of Chinese Buddhism, gives \u8309 as the Chinese equivalent for malika or Jasminum.\n\nCh., XXXII, 35, writes \u8309 nai or \u9806\u679c pin kuo, and figures, it seems, a large apple. Pin kuo in North China is the common name for apple. Many years ago the late French bishop Mgr. Delaplace told me that in the Province of Chekiang the nai is a common fruit, and that it is neither a plum nor an apple, but a fruit peculiar by itself. In Japan this character is applied to the quince. Amoen. exot., 800, \u8309 dai, Malus cotonea, fructu mediocri, rotundo, compresso, vulga kara nas (i.e., Pyrus sinica).

The \u6ab5 is mentioned in the Tso ch'uan. (In Legge's edition of the Tso ch'uan the character is written \u6ab5 kia).\n\nI must avow that the above definitions of the Rh ya [290-292] with respect to the names huai, ts'iu and kia, as well as Kuo P'o's explanations, are unintelligible to me. It would seem that the ts'iu and the kia are considered to be varieties of the huai. [Comp. also infra, 508.] In the\ndictionary Cheng Tsz-tung it is affirmed that \u6a39 is the ancient form for \u6a39. It is not stated whence this fact is derived. The Shuo wen says \u6a39 is the same as \u6a39. The K.D. and W.D., 353, also take the characters \u6a39\u548c\u6a39 to be identical. Only the second is found in the modern editions of the Classics (Mencius, Tso ch'uan). The Rh ya, however, does not mean to identify them, for in 307 \u6a39kia appears as the name of a tree which has nothing to do with the trees noticed under 290 and 292, but seems to be the tea tree.\n\nE., 240, family \u6a39, figure of a big tree with large palmate leaves.

It grows in the mountains. Its wood is used for tires of wheels. The white ts'in is a large tree with round forked leaves.\n\n[V. infra, 545.]\n\n295.\u2014\u7d42 Chung; \u725b \u860b Niu ki, ox thorn.\n\nKuo P'o:\u2014Same as \u99ac \u860b ma ki.

It is provided with spines. The fruit resembles ear pendants, is of a dark red colour, edible.\n\n[V. infra, 534.]\nIn P., XXXVI, 28, the ya or pai jui is identified with the \u7a2e\u6838 jui ho. Li Shi-cheng says the character \u690d of the Rh ya has the same pronunciation as \u7a2e, and has in later times been substituted for the first. Han Pao-sheng [10th century] describes the jui ho as a tree with leaves like those of the kou ki (Lycium), but smaller and narrower. White flowers. The stem is provided with numerous small spines. The fruits are produced on the stem; they are red and resemble the fruits called wu wei tsz (Schizandra). They ripen in the fifth or sixth month, are edible; the people gather and dry them. Another author says it is a small tree, from 5 to 7 feet high, with spines on the stem.\n\nThe drawings in the Kin huang, LV, 1, and in Ch., XXXVII, 35, 37, sub jui ho, seem to represent a Berberis.

We find it always coupled with the character \u6797 forest. P., XXX, 16, \u6797 \u679c lin kin. This name appears first, it seems, in the Si king tsa ki, compiled about the commencement of our era, and is applied to various wild pears and crab-apples with small, sour fruits.

There is also the \u5973\u6851 18, 19, *M. alba foliis lobatis, dissectis*.\n\n304.\u2014\u6986 *Y\u00fc*; \u767d\u6768 *Pai jen*.\n\nKuo P'o:\u2014This tree flowers early (in spring) and then produces \u835a *kia* fruits [v. infra, 469]. Its bark is white [v. infra, 528].\n\nThe *y\u00fc* tree is also mentioned in the *Shan hai king*. It is the elm, *Ulmus*. There are several species of the elm in the North of China, the most common of which in the Peking plain is the *U. pumila*, Pall. This is an improper name founded by Pallas upon shrubby specimens gathered in Daburia. At Peking it forms a stately, tall tree. Maximowicz considers this to be only a variety of our common *U. campestris*. Another species, with large leaves and fruits, *U. macrocarpa*, Hce., grows in the Peking mountains. In South China this genus is represented by *U. pareifolia*, Jacq., which is found also in Japan. In the Peking plain *U. pumila* grows very rapidly. The elm is much valued in North China for its timber, which is variously used, and especially for building carts. A nourishing white meal, containing mucilage, is obtained from the thick inner bark of the tree, much used for food by the mountain people. The same enters also into the composition of the so-called \"joss-sticks\" (incense sticks) burned in Buddhist temples. The fruit is used as a medicine.\nP., XXXVIb, 30, \u6986 yu. All the ancient authors quoted by Li Shih-chien speak of the white, mucilaginous meal obtained from the bark and used for food. It is called \u6986\u9eb4. The fruits (\u82f1) are said to resemble Chinese copper coins. In ancient times the people used to gather these fruits and boil them with rice.\n\nThe Kin hsiang, LVI, 17, under \u6986\u94b1\u6811 yu tsien shu (elm coin tree) represents an elm tree in fruit. The flat, orbicular, membranaceous fruit of the elm bears indeed some resemblance to Chinese copper coins. Ch., XXXIII, 21, figures only the leaves of the tree.\n\nThe name pai jen for the elm in the Rh ya may perhaps be derived from \u767d\u7c89 pai jen, white meal.\n\nPhou za, LXXXV, 1, 2, \u6986 yu, Ulmus campestris.\n\nUlmus parvifolia is figured in the same Japanese work, i.e., 4, under the Chinese name \u6986\u6986. According to Henry, i.e., 217 U. parvifolia in Unpei is known under the same Chinese name, hang yu.\n\n[V. supra, 263.]\n\n305.\u2014\u5510\u68e3 T'ang ti; \u680e l.\n\nKuo P'o:\u2014It resembles the \u767d\u694a pai yang (white poplar). In Kiang tung it is called \u592b\u79fb fu i. [V. infra, 475, Prunus.]\n\nE., 302, family \u5510\u68e3, figure of a tree with large acuminate leaves.\n\nOne synonym given by an author in the text is \u96c0\u6885. Sm., 58, Cerasus communis.

Its fruit resembles the \u6a31\u6843 ying t'ao (cherry); is edible. [V. infra, 476, Prunus.]\n\nE., 280, family \u90fd\u674e, with a figure like Cerasus. Tsioh mei is mentioned as a synonym.\n307.\u2014\u6a39 Kia; \u82e6\u8336 K'iu t'u (bitter t'u).\n\nKuo P'o:\u2014A small evergreen tree resembling the \u6ab5 chi (Gardenia). A beverage is made from the leaves by boiling. Now the earliest gathering is called \u8336 t'u, the latest \u8317 ming. Another name for the plant is \u7d2b ch'uan. The people of \u8700 shu (Sze-ch'uan) call it k'a t'u.\n\nKuo P'o has evidently the tea-plant in view. The character \u8336 t'u, which has so many meanings in the Classics, may also have been a name for tea. Besides this it is proved that the character \u8336 ch'a, now in use to designate tea, has arisen out of the similar looking character \u8336 t'u. See regarding tea and its history, P., XXXII, 22, under \u8317 ming or \u8336 ch'a, and K.K.F.P., XVIII-XXI.\n\nYen Shi-ku, an author of the 7th century, who commented upon the History of the Earlier Han [B.C. 202-A.D. 25], notices that the change of the character \u8336 t'u into \u8336 ch'a, when applied to the tea-plant, took place in this period. Thus the name of the city of \u8336\u9675 T'u ling hien was then changed into \u8336\u9675 Ch'a ling hien, nowadays Ch'a ling chou in Hunan. This is confirmed by the Chinese Geogr. Dictionary, Li tai ti li chi, etc., X, fol. 266. Ch'a ling is mentioned in the Ch'a king [a treatise on the tea-plant, 8th century] among the tea-producing districts. The character ch'a for tea was not in general use before the publication of this treatise.\n\nThe Shuo wen explains the character \u8317 ming by \u8336\u82bd t'u ya (buds of the t'u, or tea-leaf). The \u8317\u83dc ming ts'ai (ming [or tea] vegetable) is mentioned in the Yen ts'e ch'un ts'iu, written some centuries B.C. [Botan. sin., I, 1092] as an article of food at the time of Yen Ying, who was a contemporary of Confucius. We read in the Shi shuo [5th century, see Botan. sin., I, 729] that Wang meng, father-in-law of the Emperor Ai ti, in the middle of the\n4th century, was very fond of drinking tea (\u8336). He used also to set this beverage before his friends who came to visit him, but they found it too bitter, and generally declined, feigning some indisposition.\n\nFrom the above translated ancient records and many others, which it would be too long to quote, it appears that the use of tea in some parts of China was known to the Chinese in early times, but it was not before the 6th or 7th century that its use as a beverage became common among all classes. The Ch'a pu, another treatise on tea, published between the 10th and 13th centuries, states that in the reign of the Emperor Wen Ti of the Sui [A.D. 589\u2013605] a Buddhist priest first recommended the boiled ming leaves as a medicine to the Emperor, who suffered from head-ache.\n\nKuo P'o mentions \u8336 ch'uan as one of the ancient names for tea. According to the ancient dictionaries Tsi yun and Lei pien [11th century] this term denoted the late and old leaves of the tea-plant.\n\nIn the above-mentioned Ch'a king, \u8336 she is given as a name for tea, referring to the third gathering. There is a passage \u8336\u897f\u5357\u4eba\u8336\u65e5\u8ac7, the people in the south-west of Shu call the tu \"she,\" which is attributed to Yang Hsiung (Yang Chi-ki), who lived in the 1st century B.C. [See Botan. sin., I, 106]. The Shuo wen defines the character she as fragrant herb.\n\nRegarding the character \u690d as a substitute for \u8336, see above, 292.\n\nE. has several volumes devoted to \u8336, not in the botanical portion of the work, but under \"Administration of Government,\" \u7d93\u6fdf, and there, under the heading of \"National Economy,\" \u98df\u8ca8, 284\u2013296. All the names can be found in chapter 288.\u2014Sm., 212.\n\n308.\u2014\u6a39\u6a38 Sn p'o; \u5fc3 Sin.

The wood is fit for making bows and shafts of carriages. [V. infra, 500.]\n\nThe wild mulberry tree in the Peking mountains is Morus alba, L., var. mongolica. It is distinguished by its large membranaceous five to seven lobed leaves. The apex of the leaf is prolonged into a long acumen. The teeth of the margin also show long points.\n\nAccording to Dr. Geerts' Japanese Woods, \u6851 in Japan is Morus indica, L.

It is said to be a tall, coniferous tree. The greenish yellow fruit is first of a sour, harsh taste, but after hour frost becomes edible.\n\nW.D., 1025, identifies the tsung, arbitrarily, it seems, with the larch or spruce, Larix orientalis, which latter is an old name [Tournefort] for the Cedar of Lebanon.\n\nSiebold, Syn. plant. woon. jap., 58, \u6a39 Abies Momi,\nLignum subtilitatem et candorem quaestum.

Kuo P'o explains \u679d\u7686\u7ff9\u7ae6. The character \u7ff9, which is found also in 328-330, means disgraceful, ugly.\n\n328.\u2014\u6851\u67f3 the sang (mulberry tree) and the lin (willow) are \u9b5a\u689d ch'ou ch'ao (ugly branches).\n\nKuo P'o explains that dropping down branches are meant.\n\n329.\u2014\u6912\u6a39 Tsiao shu; \u852c\u83dc Ch'ou k'iu.\n\nKuo P'o:\u2014Kiu is the fruit of the \u8349 yu growing in clusters. In Kiang tung they call it \u8336\u6a39 k'iu shu. It resembles the \u8336\u8449 chu yu, but is smaller. It (i.e., the fruit) is of a red colour.\n\nHing Ping:\u2014Li S\u00fcn says that shu is the same as chu yu. The Shuo wen says, the shu resembles the chu yu. It is produced in \u6dee\u5357 Hhai nan (Anhui). Tsiao is Zanthoxylon [see 259].\n\nRegarding chu yu, see infra, 498, Boyonia and Zanthoxylon.\n\nE.g., 249, family \u6934.

The cha is a sour, astringent fruit resembling a pear. It is mentioned in the Li ki. [I., infra, 479.]\n\nI confess that I am not able to explain the sense intended by the authors of the Rh ya, in adding the character \u4e4b to the above phrases. With regard to \u61c9, Williams, Dict., 62, says:\u2014The stem or peduncle of a fruit, especially of the date and pear. Tsuan means \"to bore.\"\n\n332.\u2014\u5c0f\u679d\u4e0a\u7121\u70ba\u55ac.\n\n333.\u2014\u7121\u679d\u70ba\u6a39. A branchless tree is called li.\n\n334.\u2014\u6728\u65cf\u751f\u70ba\u704c.

[I., supra, 296.]\nCHAPTER II.\n\nPlants mentioned in the Shu king, the Shu king,\nthe Li ki, the Chou li and other\nChinese Classical Works.\n\nI.\u2014Cereals.\n\n335.\u2014The character \u7a40 ku (written also \u7a40) for Cereals or Grain, is frequently met with in the classical and other ancient Chinese writings. The Shuo wen explains it:\u2014generic term for the hundred (i.e., all sorts of) grains. Whilst Western nations understand by cereals exclusively certain gramineous plants cultivated for their edible grains, which constitute the chief food of man and beast, the early Chinese writers extend the meaning of the character ku to some other cultivated plants, as beans, hemp, etc. They variously distinguish five, six or nine kinds of grain.\n\nThe term \u4e94\u7a40 wu ku or five kinds of grain seems to refer to the oldest classification of grain. It is attributed to the Emperor Shen xing. The ancient commentators enumerated these five kinds as follows:\u2014\n\n1. \u7a3b tao, Rice.\n2. \u9ea5 mai, comprising Wheat and Barley.\n3. \u7a40 tsi, Panicum miliaceum, the common Millet.\n4. \u8c46 shu, Panicum miliaceum, glutinous variety.\n5. \u8c46 shu, the Soy bean, Soja hispida.\n\nSome commentators have \u7ce0 liang, Setaria italica, instead of tsi; others substitute \u9ebb ma, hemp, Cannabis sativa, for tao, rice.\nMencius says [Legge, 297]:\u2014Of all the seeds the best are the wu ku, the five kinds of grain. Ibidem, 318:\u2014In Mih (barbarian tribes in the north) not all the five kinds of corn are grown. It only produces the millet, shu.\n\nWe find the term wu ku again in the Li ki, I, 272. Legge translates:\u2014the five esculent plants. Ibidem, I, 121:\u2014Legge translates the same term wu ku by \u201cthe five kinds of grain,\u201d and, I, 291, by \u201cdifferent grain.\u201d Ibidem, I, 307:\u2014Legge has \u201cthe five grains.\u201d In this case the Chinese text of the Li ki has \u4e94\u7a2e wu chung, the five seeds. The same term is found in the Chou li, II, 269 [Biot\u2019s translation]:\u2014Province de \u6cb3\u5357 Yu tehcou (Honan). Les cultures qui lui conviennent sont les cinq esp\u00e8ces de semences \u5176\u7a40\u5b9c\u4e94\u7a2e.\n\nThe ancient Chinese term \u201cthe five kinds of grain\u201d is also usual in Japan. We read in Amon. exot., 834, under \u7c73:\u2014come, Oryza in genere: quinque grana Japoniis go kokf secundum excellentiam dicuntur: come, Oryza; o muggi, Hordeum; ko muggi, Triticum; daidsu, Phaseoli facie Lupini (Soja hispida); sjodsu seu adsuki, Phaseoli vulgaribus similes (Phaseolus radiatus).\n\nIn the Chou li other classifications of the cereals also occur. We read in Biot\u2019s translation, I, 70:\u2014\n\nL\u2019intendant des mets du palais (\u81b3\u592b) est pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 aux substances v\u00e9g\u00e9tales, boissons, viandes assaisonn\u00e9es, etc. . . . .

The Shuo wen explains it by \u5609\u7a40 excellent corn. The Kuang ya says ho is a term for growing ripe plants of millet and rice. Chu Hi explains that it is a general name for growing grain in stalks.\n\nLegge, in the Shi king, 232, 469, says that ho means growing grain, especially paddy (rice). W.D., 254, ho=growing grain, especially paddy in the Southern Provinces and wheat in the Northern; grain, corn.\n\n337.\u2014Among the cultivated plants which furnish cereal food to the Chinese, Rice takes the most important place. It was cultivated in China from a very early period and is frequently noticed in almost all the ancient classical works under the name of \u7a3b tao, which is still in use.\n\nW.D., 868, says that tao means rice when growing in the field, paddy, and [590] that rice after it is hulled is called \u7c73 mi. Legge translates tao by rice in the plant, paddy, also unhulled rice.\n\nLi ki, I, 117:\u2014According to the rules for all sacrifices in the ancestral temple, tao, paddy, is called \u5609\u7a40 kia shu (the admirable vegetable).

My remarks in brackets.\n\nThe glutinous rice [\u7a0c, v. infra, 338] was thought to suit beef; millet [\u9ecd Panicum miliaceum glutinosum, v. infra, 341] to suit mutton; glutinous millet [\u7a37 Panicum miliaceum non glutinosum, v. infra, 343] to suit pork; maize [\u7cb1 Zea mays, v. infra, 344] to suit dog; wheat [\u9ea5] to suit goose; and the broad-leaved squash [\u83d3 Hydropyrum latifolium, v. infra, 350] to suit fish.\n\nThe same statements are found in the Chou li, I, 94.\nShuo wen that in the same kingdom the tao is called \u7a17 no. But, as is well known, no is the glutinous rice, the grains of which, when boiled, become sticky. In the Rh ya i [12th century], as quoted in K.D., it is stated:\u2014The grain of the tao looks like frozen dew. It grows in water. Another name is t'u. There are two varieties of it, one of them is glutinous, the other not glutinous. Nowadays [i.e., in the 12th century] the people term the first no, the other \u7a17 keng. The Shuo wen defines the latter character, which is also written \u7a17 keng, as a kind of rice, and gives \u7a17 lien as a name for rice without the glutinous matter. From the above passage in the Rh ya i, it appears that tao is taken there, as nowadays, as a general name for all kinds of rice. The author of the Pen ts'ao kang mu, however, [P., XXII, 31] considers \u7a17 tao to be a name designating glutinous rice [as does the Shuo wen], and treats of the common rice separately under the head of \u7a17 keng [XXII, 34].\n\nIn his Li ki, I, 302, Legge translates the characters \u7a17 \u7c73 shu tao by rice and other glutinous grains. Although the first of these characters, according to the dictionaries, means glutinous millet [v. infra] I am not satisfied with Legge's translation. Shu is, I think, here to be taken as an adjective, in the sense of glutinous, and by shu tao [used for the preparation of liquors, as the text says] glutinous rice is meant. P., l. c., quotes a passage from an old treatise on husbandry, in which the author, Fang Sheng-chi [1st century B.C.] says:\u2014In the third month the \u7a17 \u7c73 keng tao [or common rice, v. supra] is sown, in the 4th month the \u7a17 \u7c73 shu tao. Li Shih-chen adds that the latter is the glutinous rice.\n\nIn the Shan hai king the \u7a17 \u7c73 t'u mi and the \u7a17 \u7c73 are mentioned together with the \u7a17 s\u016b ns used in offerings to the mountain spirits. The character s\u016b occurs also in the Li sao, 50. Herv\u00e9 de Saint-Denys translates it:\u2014Le riz purifi\u00e9 des sacrifices.\nPLANTS MENTIONED IN CLASSICAL WORKS.\n\nAman. erot., 834:\u2014\u7a40 ko, vulgo motsi gomme.

Its culture can likewise be traced back to remote antiquity. It was known to the ancient Chinese by the same name, \u9ea5 mai, as nowadays. In the popular language it is called \u5c0f\u9ea5 siao mai (little mai) whilst by \u5927\u9ea5 tu mai (great mai) barley is designated. Both these popular terms are also of ancient use, for they are found in Fang Sheng-chi's treatise on husbandry [1st century B.C.] The Shuo wen explains the character mai by \u8292\u7a40 mang ku (bearded grain).\n\nAnother ancient and classical name for wheat is \u7a57 lai, written also \u7a57, and sometimes simply \u7a57, without the radical, as in the Shi king. This latter character forms also the upper part of the radical character \u9ea5 mai.\n\nThe Shuo wen says that this corn is an excellent present, which came down to man from heaven, wherefore the character designating wheat includes the character lai \"to come.\" According to the same Shuo wen, \u7a57 lai is the common name for wheat in the kingdom of \u9f4a Ts'i (Northern Shantung).\n\nWheat is not noticed in the Rh ya, although the character \u9ea5 occurs twice in the text [32 and 125] forming a part of compound names of plants. The Kuang ya has \u7a57 lai, same as \u5c0f\u9ea5.\n\nLi ki, I, 226, \u9ea5 wheat presented with fish for sacrifices at the altar of the spirits of the land.

The classical name of this cereal is \u7a17 mou, sometimes, as in the Shi king, written \u7a17, without the radical. The character mou is not found in the Rh ya; the Kuang ya explains it by \u5927\u9ea6 ta mai (the great mai), which latter is still the popular Chinese name for barley.\nWheat and barley in Chinese books are often termed the \u4e8c\u9ea5 rh mai or the two mai, the smaller and the greater.\n\nBarley is twice mentioned in the Shi king, together with wheat [see 389].\n\nMencius, 280, terms the barley \u7d93\u9ea5 mou mai.\n\nComp. regarding barley P., XXII, 23, \u5927\u9ea5 ta mai and the drawing Ch., I, 15. See also Phon zo, XL, 8; Amoen. erot., 834.\n\n341.\u2014Frequent mention is made in the Chinese Classics of the common millet, Panicum miliaceum, L., of which the Chinese from early times distinguish two varieties, the \u9ea5 shu and the \u7a2e tsi. [See P., XXIII, 1-5.] The shu is characterised by a glutinous matter contained in its seeds, which property becomes apparent when these seeds are boiled, whilst the seeds of the tsi, like those of the Panicum miliaceum, cultivated in the south of Europe, are not glutinous. Complete herbarium specimens of both varieties were sent from Peking to the late Dr. Hance and to other competent botanists for examination. These botanists were not able to make out any botanical difference between these two, considered by the Chinese as distinct plants.\n\nThe \u9ea5 shu has now the same name as in ancient times. It is much cultivated throughout the Empire. The hulled grains are called \u9ec3\u7c73 huang mi (yellow grain, also an ancient term). The \u7a2e tsi is known at Peking under the popular name of mei tsz. They write the first character \u9ea5 or \u7a2e. This is likewise an ancient synonym. P. quotes an author of the Han dynasty, who says that in the western part of Northern China the tsi is called mei (or mi).\n\nDrawings of the shu and the tsi are given in Ch., I, 22, 25.\n\nKempfer, in his Amoen. erot. [834] notices only the \u7a2e sioku vulgo kibi. Milium vulgare, semine luteo. The\nPhon zo [XLI, 1, 2] considers \u7a37 and \u7a17 to be synonyms, and represents under these names Panicum miliaceum.\n\nThe Shuo wen calls the tsi the best of all grains, notices the glutinous properties of the shu, and quotes a statement by Confucius, that the shu is employed in producing fermented liquors [as nowadays]. P. quotes ancient authors who speak of the likeness of the two plants, the only difference being the glutinous seeds of the shu.\n\nLegge translates the character shu generally by millet. In the Shi king he identifies it, on the authority of Williams, with Milium nigricans.\u00b9\u00b2\n\nBiot [Chou li, I, 26, 94] calls the shu erroneously Milium globosum, also gros millet.\n\nLi ki, I, 80:\u2014Do not use chopsticks in eating millet (shu). I, 117:\u2014According to the rule for sacrifices in the ancestral temple, the shu is called \u854e\u5408 liang ho, the fragrant mass. I, 226:\u2014For the sacrifices at the altar of the spirits of the land and grain, the common people in autumn presented millet (shu). I, 273, [Yue ling]:\u2014In the second month of summer the husbandmen present [the first fruit of] their millet (shu).

It only produces the millet shu.\n\n312.\u2014In ancient Chinese works several varieties of the shu or glutinous millet are distinguished\u2014the black, white, red, yellow, the double-kernelled.\n\nThe character \u7a17 ku, repeatedly mentioned in the Classics, is explained in the Rh ya [69] by \u9ed1\u9ecd hei shu (black glutinous millet). This millet was used in ancient times for making fermented liquors, \u9152 ch'ang employed in sacrifices [r. infra, 349]. Williams [Dict., 439, 776] suggests that the black-seeded millet of the Classics may have been a variety of sorghum, for no species of Milium now cultivated has black seeds. I do not agree with this view, for there is evidence from ancient Chinese authors that sorghum became first known in China in the 3rd century of our era. It had probably been introduced from India. The character hei, meaning black, is not necessarily to be taken literally; it may in this case mean dark coloured.\n\nChou li, I, 398, 468:\u2014Si l'empereur meurt le sous-superieur des c\u00e9r\u00e9monies sacr\u00e9es fait laver le corps avec du vin de millet noir \u7a17\u9152.\n\nL'officier du vin odorant est charg\u00e9 de pr\u00e9parer le techang (\u9b2f) ou vin odorant extrait du millet noir (\u79ec).\nShi king, 470:\u2014Hou tsi [v. infra, 343] gave his people the beautiful grains, the black millet (k\u016b) and the double-kernelled, etc.; and [620] he taught the people how to sow and to reap the millets shu and tsi and the black millet (k\u016b).\n\nA variety of the k\u016b or black millet was called \u7a17 p'ei. The text of the Rh ya [70] explains that two seeds are contained within one glume, and Kro Po adds that it is a variety of the black millet. I am not prepared to say what this double-kernelled millet was. It is once mentioned in the Shi king together with the k\u016b [v. supra].\n\nThe \u767d\u9ecd pai shu or white (glutinous) millet is mentioned in the Li ki [I, 45] among the grains used for food.\n\n343.\u2014The \u7a17 tsi, the common millet, Panicum miliaceum, (the seeds of which are not glutinous) was in the classical period much used in sacrifices. Tsi was also the title of an office exercised under the Emperor Shun [B.C. 2255] the functions of which were the supervision of agriculture. The holder of this post was \u695a K't, a brother of the Emperor Yao, to whom the princes of the house of Chou traced their lineage. [See Mayers' Chinese Reader's Manual, p. 223, and Botan. sin., I, p. 76.] He was known under the title \u540e\u7a37 Hou tsi. Two odes of the Shi king [pp. 465, 620] are devoted to him.\n\nLegge translates the character tsi generally correctly by \"panicked millet\" or \"sacrificial millet,\" but in the Li ki twice erroneously by \"rice.\" Li ki, I, 443:\u2014Artemisia along with millet and rice (the text has \u7a17 \u7a17) burned with the fat of the victims in sacrifices. Id., I, 459:\u2014Of grain food there were millet, the glutinous rice, rice (the text has \u7a17 \u7a17 \u7a17). Id., I, 461:\u2014Glutinous millet (the text has \u7a17 common millet) suits pork.\nBiot, *Chou li*, I, 94:\u2014Le petit millet (*tsi*) convient avec le porc. *Id.*, I, 26, Biot identifies the *tsi* erroneously with *Helvus sorghum*.\n\nRegarding other passages in the *Chou li* and the *Shi king*, where *tsi* occurs with *shu*, see the latter [341]. The *shu* and the *tsi* are frequently mentioned in the *Shu king*.\n\nThe character \u68ee *tsi* of the Classics is given in the *Rh ya* [27] as a synonym of \u7a37 *tsi*.\n\nIn the *Li ki* [I, 117] we read:\u2014According to the rules for sacrifices in the ancestral temple, the sacrificial millet (\u7a37) is called \u660e\u68ee *ming tsi*, the bright grain.\n\n*Chou li*, I, 445:\u2014Le sous-sup\u00e9rieur des c\u00e9r\u00e9monies sacr\u00e9es distingue le nom et la couleur des six sortes de grains consacr\u00e9s, \u516d\u8272 *liu tsi*, ainsi que leur usage sp\u00e9cial. Commentaire B. [*Cheng Huan*]:\u2014*Ts* est ici pour \u68ee nom g\u00e9n\u00e9rique des six grains [*v. supra*, 335].\n\nThe character \u68ee appears in the *Shu king* [286]. Legge:\u2014A kind of millet. Mencius [142] says:\u2014It is said in the *Li* (Book of Rites): a prince ploughs himself and is assisted by the people to supply the millet of sacrifice \u68ee\u76db.\n\nThe same character *tsi* is met with in the *Tzu chuan* [48, 49]. The commentary explains it by \u68ee\u7a40.\n\nLegge [*Shi king*, 110] says that the character \u7a37 *tsi* is the same as \u7a37. It is not found in the Classics, but it was in use several centuries B.C., as appears from the quotations in *K.D.* The *Shuo wen* identifies it with \u9ea5 *mi*, which, as we have seen, is a popular name for the common millet.\n\n344.\u2014Another important millet, most extensively grown all over the Chinese Empire, especially in the Northern Provinces, the \u68ee *liang*, is also frequently mentioned in the Classics. It is the *Setaria italica*, Kth., (*Panicum*\nitalicum, L.), easily distinguished from the paneled millet by its long and dense compound nodding spikes. This is also largely cultivated for food in the South of Europe.\n\nSee regarding the liang, P., XXIII, 7. The popular name of it at Peking is \u7a57\u5b50 ku tsz', the hulled corn is called \u5c0f\u7c73 siao mi (small grain). Its grains are much smaller than those of Panicum miliaceum. In the north of China, where rice is not much cultivated, it forms the principal food of the lower classes.\n\nA good drawing of the plant, under liang, is found in Ch., I, 18. The plant figured under \u7a57 in the Phon zo [XLI, 7, 8] is likewise Setaria italica.\n\nBiot [l.e., I, 70] translates the character liang by gros millet or Holcus. Legge renders it by large-grained millet, but more generally by maize. I may observe that maize, an American plant, was unknown to the ancient Chinese. Williams [Dict., 525] identifies the liang correctly with the common spiked millet, but he is wrong in calling it \"canary seed,\" for the latter is supplied by Phalaris canariensis.\n\nLi ki, I, 106:\u2014In bad years, when the grain is not coming . . . . . . the great officers will not eat the large-grained millet (liang). I, 117:\u2014According to the rules for the sacrifices in the ancestral temple, the liang is called \u9ea5\u7a40 liang ki [regarding ki, see infra, 354]. I, 429 [\"Grain Food of the Ancient Chinese\"] :\u2014Maize (liang) and yellow maize (\u9ec3\u7a40), cut when ripe or when green. I, 461:\u2014Maize (liang) suits dog.\n\nChou li, I, 94:\u2014Le millet liang convient avec le chien.\n\nShi king, 184:\u2014We cannot plant our rice and maize (liang), how shall our parents get food? 301:\u2014Yellow bird, do not eat my maize (liang). 379:\u2014The millets, the rice and the maize (liang) will awake the joy of our husbandmen.\nMencius, 296:\u2014He who is benevolent and righteous does not wish for fat meat and fine millet (liang).\n\n345.\u2014In the Shi king [470] in the ode devoted to the legend of Hou Tsi, mention is made of a millet \u7ce0 men. Legge terms it the tall red millet, large-grained millet, a variety of Hordeus. Williams [Dict., 577] says that men is the name of a variety of millet with reddish ears, now applied in Chihli to the glutinous grain of the \u7ce0 shu or panicle millet, Milium, called \u7ce0\u5b50\u7c73 men tsz mi, and used in distilling spirits. But Williams is mistaken. He intends, it seems, the \u7ce0\u5b50 wei tsz, which is the common panicle millet, not the glutinous variety [see the preceding].\n\nThe Chinese commentator on whom Legge relies, explains the above character men by \u8d64\u7cb1\u7c9f chi liang su, red spiked millet, and Kuo P'o explains by the last three characters the \u7ce0 men or \u8d64\u82d7 chi miao, red blade of the Rh ya, 67. The Shuo wen writes \u8d64\u82d7\u5609\u7a40, excellent corn of the red blade. Hing Ping says that the character men in the Rh ya is the same as the men of the Shi king. P., however, takes these names to refer to varieties of the shu or glutinous millet, not of the liang or Setaria italica.\n\n346.\u2014There occurs in the Shi king also the character \u84bf ki, applied to a kind of millet, which Legge terms the white millet. It is mentioned, together with other cereals, [470] in the ode devoted to Hou Tsi. 284:\u2014Gathering of white millet in the fields brought only one year under cultivation. 463:\u2014By the Feng water grows the white millet.\n\nThe text of the Rh ya, [68] explains ki by \u767d\u82d7 pai miao, white blade; the Shuo wen writes \u767d\u82d7\u5609\u7a40, excellent corn of the white blade. Kuo P'o explains it by \u767d\u7cb1\u7c9f pai liang su, white Setaria italica. P., however, thinks that it was a variety of the glutinous millet shu.\nMao is of opinion that in the above-quoted passages from the *Shi king* the character *k'i* refers to different plants, for in 470 he explains it by \u767d\u82d7, as in the *Rh ya*; in 284 by \u83dc vegetable; and in 463 by \u8349 herb. Lu ki describes the *k'i* as a kind of sow-thistle [*v. infra*]. Chu Ht also understands by *k'i* the \u82e6\u83dc *k'u ts'ai* or sow-thistle. But Legge, following Yen Ts'an and Kiang Ping-chang, translates *k'i* in all the three passages by white millet.\n\nIn the *Shan hai king*, *k'i* is the name of a tree, \u82e6\u6728.\n\n347.\u2014The character \u7c9f *su*, applied nowadays to a distinct grain plant (*Setaria*), had in ancient times only the meaning of unhulled grain. Legge [Mencius, 466, note] states that *su* was rice in the husk, and \u7c73 *mi*, hulled rice, that according to the *Pen ts'ao kung mu*, anciently *su* was the general name for all glumaceous grain, and that it is now commonly used for millet.\n\nLi ki, I, 84:\u2014\u7c9f\u7c73 *su mi*, unhulled grain and hulled grain. The commentary says:\u2014*su* same as *ku* (general name for grain). After the husk has been taken off it is called *mi*.\n\nChou li, I, 390:\u2014Les officiers des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts sont charg\u00e9s de conserver les quantit\u00e9s livr\u00e9es de grains non \u00e9corc\u00e9s (\u7c9f).\n\n*Shi king*, 301:\u2014Yellow bird, do not eat my paddy (*su*). 335:\u2014With a handful of grain (*su*) I go out and divine how I may be able to become good.\n\n*Shu king*, 142:\u2014Five hundred *li* constituted the imperial domain. From the first hundred *li* they brought as revenue the whole plant of the grain (\u7a40); from the second they brought the ears (\u7a40); from the third they brought only the straw (\u7a40), but had to perform other services; from the fourth they gave the grain in the husk (\u7c9f), and from the fifth the grain cleaned (\u7c73).\nPLANTS MENTIONED IN CLASSICAL WORKS.\n\nMencius, 85:\u2014Rice and other grain (\u7c73\u7c9f) Conf.\nAmd., 49, grain (su).

Such a plant is figured under the name of su in\nCh., I, ii.\n\nAmora, exot., 835:\u2014\u7c9f d\u017eekie, vulgo aura. Panicum, juba\nmagna pendula, villosa, semine acreo.

Li Ssu-\nchen, in P., XXIII, 12, and before him earlier writers,\nidentify the grain plant \u7a57 shu, mentioned in the Classics,\nwith a glutinous variety of \u7ce0 liang or \u7c9f su. The Rh ya,\n28, gives shu as a synonym of \u7a57 chung, and Kuo P'o\nexplains it by glutinous su. Other Chinese authors seem\nto confound \u7a57 with the homophonous character \u79e7 shu\n[v. supra, 341]. The Shuo wen says that it is a glutinous\nvariety of the \u7a57.\n\nRegarding the meaning of \u7a57 in the Li ki [v. supra, 338].\n\nChou li, II, 516, 517:\u2014Pour teindre les plumes qui\ndoivent orner les \u00e9tendards et les drapeaux du char de\nl'empereur, on trempe dans le cinabre des grains de millet\nrouge (\u7a42). Apr\u00e8s trois lunes on les fait cuire. On les\narrose et on y trempe les plumes. Biot, in translating the\ncharacter shu, follows Commentator A. (Cheng Sz'-nung), who explains it by \u8d64\u7c9f red su.\n\nA variety of Setaria italica with red glutinous seeds is cultivated in the neighbourhood of Peking under the name \u7d05\u7c98\u7a40\u5b50 hong nieh ku tsz (red glutinous Setaria).\n\n[Compare the drawing in the Phon zo, XII, 11, 12, \u7a17 Panicum?].\n\n349.\u2014The use of intoxicating beverages prepared from the grains of cereals was well known to the Chinese in the classical period. The characters \u9152 tsia, nowadays a general name for spirits, wine, beer and other drinks, and \u9189 tsui, to be drunk, are repeatedly met with in the odes of the Shi king and also in the other Classics.\n\nShi king, 395:\u2014Ode against drunkenness. 399:\u2014When they have drunk too much they become insensible of their errors. With their caps on one side and like to fall off, they keep dancing and will not stop.\n\nShu king, 399:\u2014Book X is entitled \u9152\u8aa5 [the Announcement about Drunkenness] ascribed to the Duke of Chon [12th century B.C.]. The debauchery of Kee was the chief cause of the downfall of the Hia dynasty. The Duke said:\u2014When Heaven was sending down its favouring decree, and laying the foundation of the eminence of our people, spirits (\u9152) were used only in the great sacrifices. . . . The ruin of states may also be traced invariably to their crime in the abuse of spirits.\n\nThe invention of wine or spirits in China is generally ascribed to a certain \u5100\u72c4 I ti, who lived in the time of the Emperor Y\u00fc. [See regarding this legend Mayers' Chinese Reader's Manual, 230.] According to others the inventor of wine was \u675c\u5eb7 Tu K'ang [see P., XXV, 31].\n\nLegge translates the character \u9152 tsia in the Classics by liquor or distilled spirits, and states that it always denotes\nthe product of distillation and has been incorrectly translated by wine. \u9152 li is the product in its earlier stage, before the process of distillation is commenced, after the mashing and fermentation, as the Chinese commentator explains:\u2014when the juice and the refuse are mixed together, it is called \u9152 or sweet spirits. [Legge's Shu king, 260, 399, Shi king, Proleg., 153.] The character \u84b8 cheng [to steam, W.D., 74] occurring in the Classics in connection with the fabrication of spirits, is translated \"to distil\" by Legge [Shi king, 471], and \u9152 s\u0101 and \u9152 li are rendered by \"to strain off spirit.\" For straining, the ancient Chinese used the \u8305 m\u00e0o grass [c. infra, 459].\n\nDr. Eddins has, it seems to me, convincingly refuted Dr. Legge's opinion that the tsin of the ancient Chinese was the product of distillation, for in his papers on the subject [China Review, VI, 211; XV, 309] he gives reasonable certainty that distillation was entirely unknown in Chinese antiquity. Eddins proposes to translate \u9152 tsin by \"wine.\" The tsin used in sacrifices, etc., was simply produced by fermenting grain without distilling the liquor. According to P., XXV, 41, distillation was introduced into China during the Mongol dynasty. Li Shih-chien therefore distinguishes between \u9152 tsin (wine) and the \u70e7\u9152 sh\u0101o tsin (or fired [distilled] wine), for which he gives the foreign equivalent \u963f\u523a\u5409 a-la-ki. Evidently arak, the Persian name for brandy, is meant.\n\nNowadays the strong distilled spirit, made in the north of China from the grains of sorghum, is called sun shao (thrice fired) which is pronounced sun shu in the south.\n\nQuotations from the Classics regarding wine:\u2014\n\nLi ki, I, 181, 135. I, 117:\u2014According to the rules for the sacrifices in the ancestral temple, spirits (\u9152) are called \u6e05\u914c (the clear cup). I, 460 [\"Diet of the Ancient Chinese\"]:\u2014Of drinks there was must (\u91b2 li) in two vessels, one strained,\nthe other unstrained, made of rice (\u7a3b), millet (\u9ecd), or of maize (\u7a40). I, 301, [Yue ling]:\u2014Second month of winter. Orders are given to the grand superintendent of liquors (\u9152\u6b63) to see that the rice and other glutinous grain are all complete; that the leaven cakes (\u9eb4\u85e5) are in season.\n\nChou li, I, 99:\u2014L'intendant des vins (\u9152\u6b63) est charg\u00e9 de la direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des vins. I, 104:\u2014Les employ\u00e9s aux vins sont charg\u00e9 de faire les cinq vins de libation, et les trois vins qui se boivent. [For particulars regarding these wines, see Legge's Li ki, I, 460, 447.]\n\nAccording to the ancient authors quoted in P., XXV, 31, article tsiu, wine in China was made in ancient times, as in our days, of the grains of rice (it seems especially glutinous rice), glutinous panicle millet (shu), and glutinous spiked millet (ling).\n\nThere is in the Asiatic Museum of St. Petersburg an manuscript, presented in 1755 to the Academy by the Jesuit Father d'Incarville. [Comp. my Early European Researches on the Flora of China, 122]. It treats of the natural objects found in the neighborhood of Peking, and concludes with a treatise on Chinese wine:\u2014Vin ou plus-t\u00f4t bi\u00e8re blanche de Chine, faite avec du riz et du mil rond, en chinois huang tsien (vin jaune). d'Incarville gives a detailed description of the mode of preparing this wine or beer from the boiled huang mi (glutinous panicle millet), to which is added kin tze (\u9eb5\u5b50), or yeast made of wheaten flour, in order to produce a vinous fermentation, etc.\n\nA similar account regarding the same subject was given by Father Cibot in the M\u00e9m. con\u00e7. les Chinois, V, 457:\u2014Vin de Chine qui est une vraie bi\u00e8re, fait de mil rond mond\u00e9. Comp. also Dabry de Thiersaut, \"Vins et eaux-de-vie chinoises,\" in Bull. Soc. d'Aclim. de Paris, 1878, 90-1102.\n\nThe common tsiu or \u9ec3\u9152 huang tsiu of the Chinese of our days, which I believe is the tsiu of the Classics, in North\nChina is made of the glutinous panicle millet (shu); in Middle and South China glutinous rice is more generally used. This rice is employed for the fabrication of the much-esteemed wine of Shao hing, a city of Chekiang. Dr. DUNGEON, in his interesting book [Diet, Dress, etc., of the Chinese, p. 143] compares the Chinese yellow wine of Peking to a weak Sherry.\n\nIn the classical period the Chinese used to prepare from the \u9ed1\u8c37 or black millet a peculiar fragrant wine called \u9187\u9152 ch'ang. It was employed in sacrifices. They mixed it with the plant \u83ca yu [v. infra, 408].\n\nChou li, I, 468, 398:\u2014L'officier du vin odorant (\u9b2f\u4eba) est charg\u00e9 de pr\u00e9parer le ch'ang ou vin odorant extrait du millet noir (\u9ed1\u8c37 k\u016b). Commentator B. (Cheng Huan):\u2014On fait fermenter le millet noir et on en fait du vin, dont le parfum se r\u00e9pand en haut et en bas, lorsque le repr\u00e9sentant du d\u00e9funt ou de l'anc\u00eatre fait la libation. Ma Yung dit que ch'ang est une plante aromatique, mais Kong Ying-ta observe que c'est le nom sp\u00e9cial d'un vin qui se fait avec le millet noir et deux parties de riz.

Idem, Shu king, 449, 618.\n\n\u9eb4 k'\u00fc, also written \u9eb4, is the Chinese name for leaven, used to produce fermentation in making wine. The Shuo wen explains the character by \u9152\u6bcd ts'in mu, mother of wine.\n\nLeaven cakes, \u9eb4\u9905 k'\u00fc ye, are mentioned in the Li ki, Yue ling [see quotation above] and in the Shu king, 260, where Legge translates k'\u00fc ye by \"malt,\"\nAccording to P., XXV, 17, the k\u0101 or leaven is prepared from wheaten flour, also from barley or rice. D'Incarville and Cibot say from wheaten flour, barley or oats.\n\nVinegar, usually procured from an infusion of malt which has previously undergone the vinous fermentation, was also known to the Chinese in early days. Biot translates the character \u918b hi [in the Chou li, I, iii], by \"vinegar.\" Legge renders the same by \"pickles\" [Li ki, I, 79]. W.D., 177, same character defined by \"sour, vinegar like.\" In the Shuo wen, hi is explained by \u9178 suan (sour), and P., XXV identifies it with \u918b tsu (also written \u918b) which is the modern name for vinegar.\n\nRegarding the Chinese mode of making vinegar compare D'Incarville and Cibot, i.e.\n\nE., \"Administration of Government\" [v. supra, 307, note],\n\"National Economy,\" \u9152 269-283,\nE., \"National Economy,\" 300, deals with vinegar.\n\n350.\u2014The Chou li, as well as the Li ki, mentions an edible grain called \u83dc ku, which some of the early commentators include in the six or nine kinds of cereals [v. supra, 335]. Legge translates ku by broad-leaved water-squash.\n\nLi ki, I, 460 [\"Diet of the Ancient Chinese\"]:-For relishes, snail-juice and a condiment of the broad-leaved water-squash were used with pheasant-soup. I, 461 :-The broad-leaved squash was thought to suit fish.\n\nChou li, I, 94 :-Le millet aquatic (kou) convient avec le poisson. I, 70 :-Commentator C. (Kia Kung-yen) says: In the south they have the \u83dc\u7c73 ku mi. It is also called \u5f6d\u80e1 tiao hu.\n\nThe Shuo wen gives as synonyms for ku, \u5f6d \u83dc tiao ku and \u83dc tsiang. The Kuang yu has \u83dc ku or tsiang.\n\nThe Rh ya i identifies the ku with the ye tiao ping in the Rh ya, 15, and states that it is a water-plant whose leaves resemble those of the sugar-cane. In Kiangnan the people\ncall it \u83f1\u8349 kiao ts'ao. It affords an excellent fodder for horses; it grows in the marshes of \u96e8\u6d59 (Chekiang). In spring the young stalks are used as food, as well as in autumn the grains. [Comp. also Rh ya, 88, 217.]\n\nP. treats of this plant [XXIII, 15] under \u6c34\u7c73 among cereals, and [XIX, 16] under \u6c34\u7c73 among water-plants.\n\nThe plant here spoken of is the Hydropyrum latifolium, Ledeb., a tall grass, still cultivated throughout China for its young stalks, known by the name of \u83f1\u767d kiao pui, which are eaten as a vegetable. [Comp. Dr. Hance's notice of the plant in Journ. Bot., 1872, 146.] I am not aware that nowadays the seeds of this plant are gathered in China for food, but I may observe that the grains of an American species of the same genus [the H. esculentum] yield a considerable quantity of food to the Indians, wherefore it is also called Canadian Rice.\n\nFigures of the ku or kiao plant [but only leaves] are given in the Kiu huang, LIII, 27, and Ch., XVIII, 13.\n\nSiebold, Syn. plant. econ. jap., 368, \u6c34\u7c73 Makoma.

The drawing seems to represent Hydropyrum latifolium.\n\nV. supra, 88.\n\n351.\u2014Biot, in his article on the Manners of the Ancient Chinese according to the Shi king, translated by Legge, Shi king, Proleg, 142-171, writes:\u2014We can tell the principal kinds of cereals mentioned in the Shi king and point out the localities where they were cultivated. They were rice, wheat, barley, buck-wheat (sarrasin), two sorts of millet, the shu and the tsi.\n\nI have not been able to make out what character in the Shi Biot refers to buck-wheat. This grain, now much cultivated in China under the name of \u83f1\u9ea6 kiao mai, seems\nto have been unknown to the ancient Chinese. It is not mentioned in the oldest Chinese treatises on husbandry. The name *kiao mai* first appears in the *Tsi min yao shu* [5th century]. See also the *Nung cheng ts'\u00fcan shu*, XXVI, 11.\n\n352. \u2014We read in *Mesetas*, 297:\u2014Of all seeds the best are the five kinds of grain, yet if they be not ripe they are not equal to the \u7a2e *tsi* and the \u7a2e *pai*. So the value of benevolence depends entirely on its being brought to maturity.\n\nRegarding these plants, Legge translates the following particulars drawn from *P.*, XXIII, 13, *pai*, and other Chinese works:\u2014The *tsi* and the *pai* are two plants closely resembling one another. They are a kind of spurious grain, yielding a rice-like seed, but smaller. They are to be found at all times, in wet situations and dry, and when crushed and roasted may satisfy the hunger in a time of famine. One kind of *pai* is called in the north bird paddy \u9ce5\u79be *niao ho*.\n\nI am not prepared to say to what graminicons plant the *tsi* answers. [17, supra, *Rh ya*, 61] where the name is written \u7a2e. Compare also the Calendar of the Hia [36]:\u2014In the second month panic grass, \u7a2e *tsi*, is gathered. Kuo Po says that the *tsi* resembles the \u7a2e *pai*. As to the latter name, it is applied at Peking to *Panicum (Echinochloa) crus galli*. L., a wild-growing plant, which is also cultivated for its grain. This plant has the same Chinese name in Hupei [HENRY, l.c., 335]. Legge is mistaken with respect to the name \"bird paddy,\" for the correct reading is \u9ce5\u79be *niao ho*, black corn. The ears of *P. crus galli* when ripe are of a blackish colour. [See drawings of the *pai* in the *Kiu huang*, LII, 5; *Ch.*, II, 1.]\n\nSieb., *Syn. plant. ovon. jap.*, 34, \u7a2e nora bije, *Eleosine coracana*, Gaertn. Hinc inde cultum fragmentum. But KEMPFER'S \u7a2e *jai* vulgo *jije*, *Panicum vulgare panienla\nminore, semine nigricante [Amorn. exot., 835] may rather refer to *P. crus galli*. The plant represented in the *Phun zo*, XLI, 15, under \u65f1\u7a17 (*pai* growing in dry grounds) is *P. crus galli*. *Ibidem*, 14, is the \u6c34\u7a17 (*water pai*) likewise a *Panicum*. According to Hoffm. & Schultes [407] this Chinese name is applied in Japan to *P. crus curvi*, L.\n\nE., 40, family \u7a17, figure probably of *Panicum crus galli*.\n\n---\n\n**II. \u2014 Vegetables.**\n\n353.\u2014The classical Chinese name for vegetables in general was \u852c *su*. [See Legge's *Shi king*, 548.] In the *Rh ya* (\u91cb\u5668) this term is identified with \u83dc *ts'ai* which still to this day is the common name for culinary vegetables. The term *ts'ai* occurs in the *Li ki* and in the *Shi king*, but in the latter only once in the name of an edible water-plant \u9752\u83dc *ts'ai* [r. *injra*, 399]. The *Shuo wen* explains *ts'ai* by edible herbaceous plants.\n\nThe character \u852c *shu*, likewise an old term for vegetables, explained in the *Shuo wen* by \u83dc, is, however, not used in the Chinese Classics in this sense.\n\nThere occurs in the *Li ki* a character [\u8302 *mao*] which Cheng Huan explains by \u8302 (*vegetable*), the *Rh ya* (\u91cb\u8a00) by \u8302 (to pluck). Kuo P'o adds:\u2014to pluck up vegetables.\n\nThe passage in the *Li ki* \u96de\u5154\u7686\u6709\u8302 is translated by Legge [I, 461]:\u2014Pheasants and hares were [made into soup] with the duckweed; and, *ibidem*, the term \u8302\u7fa9 is rendered [I, 451] by \"soup with vegetables.\"\n\nThe same character (*mao*) is found in the *Shi king*. Mao explains it by \"to pick out, to select.\" Legge [4] translates it according to the Sung commentaries by \"to cook,\" and says that this meaning is supported from the *Li ki*.\n354.\u2014The *shu*, also written \u8c46 and \u8033, is a collective name for leguminous plants and their seeds, pulse. It is frequently met with in the Classics. The *Kuang ya* says that *shu* denotes especially the \u5927\u8c46 *ta tou* or soy bean.\n\n*Li ki*, I, 268 [*Yue ling*]:\u2014First month of summer. The son of Heaven eats beans (*shu*) and fowls. I, 451:\u2014Beans.\n\n*Shi king*, 231 [\"Life in Pin\"]:\u2014In the seventh month they cook the pulse (*shu*), and [232]:\u2014In the ninth and tenth month the pulse (*shu*) is gathered. 334, 365:\u2014Pulse, beans gathered. 401:\u2014They gather the beans (*shu*) in their baskets, square and round. 621:\u2014Hou Tsi [*v. supra*, 343] taught the people how to sow pulse (*shu*).\n\n*Mencius* [389] said:\u2014When pulse (*shu*) and grain (*su*) are abundant as water and fire, how shall the people be other than virtuous?\n\n*Ch'un ts'iu*, 744 [Duke Ting, first year]:\u2014In winter, in the tenth month, there fell hoar frost, which killed the pulse (*shu*).\n\nNowadays \u8c46 *tou* has the same meaning as *shu*, pulse. But in the classical period *tou* was a term to designate a certain wooden vessel or dish for containing flesh sauces at sacrifices and feasts. The *Rh ya* explains \u8c46 by \"wooden vessel.\" *Biot* [*Chou li*, I, 109] translates it by \"terrines en bois.\" The meaning of pulse or beans was transferred to this character several centuries after the time of Confucius, as can be concluded from the quotations in *K.D.* The *Shuo wen*, in one place, explains *tou* by \"ancient vessels for containing meat,\" but in another chapter takes it in the sense of *shu* or pulse. Some authors of the Tsin dynasty, in the 3rd or 4th century, began to write \u8c46 *tou* to designate pulse. *W.D.*, 875, takes this to be the correct form.\n\nThe character \u79ae *ki* is explained in the *Shuo wen* by \u7c73\u7a40 stalks of pulse. But *ki* has also other meanings. \u79ae\u7a40 *huiang ki*, in the *Li ki*, is a sacrificial name for the\nSetaria italica. [V. supra, 344.] Ki is also the name of a certain aquatic plant. [See W.D., 836.]\n\nThe character \u8c46 ho is explained in the Shuo wen by young plants of pulse. The I li Classic, quoted in K.D., says \"leaves of beans.\" Mao explains it by \u82d7 (young plants).\n\nShi king, 300:\u2014Let the brilliant white colt feed on the bean sprouts (ho) of my vegetable garden.\n\n\u83a2 kia, according to the Shuo wen, is \u83dc\u5be6 (fruit of herbaceous plants). The Kuang ya defines it more precisely as \u89d2\u89d2, horns (pods) of pulse. But kia is also applied by the Chinese botanists to the silicles of cruciferous plants and the seed-vessels of the elm.\n\nBiot [in the Chou li, I, 195] is mistaken in translating \u83a2 by \"noyan des fruits.\" He confounded the character evidently with \u6838 [v. 469].\n\nE., 35-37, family \u8c46.

Sun Yen identifies it with the \u5927\u8c46 ta tou or great bean, which latter name seems to appear first in Fang Cheng-chu's book on husbandry [1st century B.C.] This is the soy bean, *Soja hispida*, Muench. [See P., XXIV, 1.] A good drawing of the plant is found in Ch., I, 8. This bean has always been considered by the Chinese as the most important of the cultivated leguminous plants. It is grown in numerous varieties all over the Empire, especially in the north, and is much esteemed for the oil yielded by its seeds. The name great bean refers to the plant, not to the seeds, which are small, of the size of a pea.\n\nThe soy bean is also largely cultivated in Japan. It is described and figured under the Chinese name \u5927\u8c46 in *Amaren*, e.rot., 838, and *So moku*, XIII, 18-21.\n\nThe soy bean is much employed in China and Japan for preparing the so-called \"bean-curd\" and the sauce called \"soy.\" The first is prepared by macerating the beans in water and milling them together with the water. The liquid pap is filtered. To this fluid is added gypsum, in order to\ncoagulate the casein, and also chloride of magnesium. The coagulated casein or bean-curd is of a jelly-like appearance. Soy is made by boiling the beans, adding water, salt and wheat, and producing fermentation by yeast.\n\nBean-curd and soy were most probably known to the Chinese in the classical period, although no distinct mention is made of these condiments in the classical writings. The ancient term \u91ac ts'iang, which Legge translates by \"sauce,\" includes, we may suppose, soy. [See Li ki, I, 459-461 \"Diet of the Ancient Chinese.\"] Conf. Ant., 96. Biot translates the ts'iang mentioned in the Chou li by \"mets d\u00e9licats.\" I, 70.\u2014Pour les mets d\u00e9licats on emploie cent vingt objets diff\u00e9rents. Compare P., XXV, 26, on the preparation of the ts'iang. At Peking the common name for soy is \u91ac\u6cb9 ts'iang yu (ts'iang oil). Williams [Dict., 764] states that the English word soy is probably derived from \u8c46\u6cb9 shi yu, in Japanese si yu. [I should think rather from \u91ac\u6cb9 pronounced sho yu in Japanese. See Herbert's Dictionary.] The character \u8c49 written \u8c49 in the Shuo wen is explained there by \u914d\u9e7d\u5e7d\u672b\u4e5f, made of salt and beans [I cannot understand what the character \u5e7d here is intended to mean]. See also P., XXV, 2, under \u5927\u8c46\u8c49.\n\nAs to the bean-curd, \u8c49\u8150 tou fu, it appears from the quotations in P., XXV, 7, that this term and the mode of making bean-curd are first mentioned in the Huai nan tsze [2nd century B.C.], but it was no doubt much earlier known in China.\n\n356.\u2014The authors of the Han period speak of another kind of pulse, which they call \u5c0f\u8c46 siato tou (small bean). An early commentator on the Chou li [c. supra, 335] includes it among the nine kinds of grain. Fan Sheng-chi, in his book on husbandry [1st century B.C.] gives details regarding its\ncultivation. The Shuo wen and the Kuang ya identify the siao ton with the \u8377 ta.\n\nP., XXIV, 10, gives ta as an old name for the \u8d64\u5c0f\u8c46 chi siu tou (red small bean). The Ts'ei min yao shu distinguishes three kinds of the small bean\u2014a red, a green and a white, referring to the colour of the seeds.\n\nAccording to Loureiro, Flora cochin., 530, siao tou in South China is the Chinese name for Phaseolus Mungo, L. In Amom. erot., 837, we have \u8377 too, vulgo atsuki. Phaseolus hirsutus lobis foliorum lutea illime auritis, ... floribus geminis uni longo petiolo insidentibus, langnide luteis ... siliqua triunciali, angusta, tereti, curva ... seminibus ciceris magnitudine ... Semina in farinam redacta quotidianam subeunt pro serilibitis et libis pinsendis crustulariorum manus. A drawing of this plant was subsequently published in Banks' Icenes Kempferi selecta, etc., tab. 40. Thunberg, Flora japon., 279, identifies Kempter's atsuki with Phaseolus radiatus, L. In the So mokn, XIII, 28, 29, \u8d64\u5c0f\u8c46 is a variety of Ph. radiatus with red seeds. Ibidem, 31, \u7da0\u8c46 Ph. radiatus, variety with green seeds. Loureiro, l. c., 529, Phaseolus radiatus, L. sinice lin tou (i.e. \u7da0\u8c46 l\u00fc tou, green bean). Ph. radiatus is a near ally to Ph. Mungo, and these two species have often been confounded by botanists. The seeds of the former may be at once distinguished from the seeds of the green variety of Ph. Mungo, by their being covered with long hairs, whilst the seeds of Ph. Mungo are glabrous. Besides this the seeds of Ph. radiatus are distinguishable by their prominent hilum. In a recently published interesting paper on some leguminous plants cultivated in Russia, Prof. A. Batalin of the Botanic Gardens, St. Petersburg, proved that the beans cultivated in North China and Manchuria (probably also those of Japan) under the name of la tou, or green beans, all belong to Ph. Mungo, not to Ph. radiatus as was formerly believed. The la tou is extensively\ncultivated all over China, and supplies an important article of food. From the flour of the small green seeds the Chinese prepare their vermicelli.\n\nOther Chinese names of Leguminosae are:\n\nJap., 7, Abrus precatorius, L., \u76f8\u601d\u5b50.

According to W.D., 1024, this is a general term for alliaceous plants with fistular leaves; onions, garlics; a leek green. But ancient as well as modern Chinese authors apply the above character, which may be translated by \"onion,\" to a distinct species of Allium, never to garlic, for which the Chinese have a peculiar name.\n\nThe ts'ung in North China is Allium fistulosum, L., a native of Siberia, Danria, Northern Mongolia. It is largely cultivated at Peking. This species is remarkable for its never forming a globular bulb, like our common Allium Cepa. A good drawing of the plant is found in Ch., III, 32. In Japan likewise the character \u8525 is applied to A. fistulosum. [See So moku, VI, 31.] According to Loureiro, Flora cochin., 249, the tsun (ts'ung) largely cultivated in Cochin-china and Southern China, is the common onion, A. cepa. This is most probably of foreign origin. P., XXVI, 9, 14, mentions, besides the common ts'ung, of which there are several varieties, the winter ts'ung, the spring ts'ung, the violet ts'ung, etc.\u2014the \u80e1\u8525 hui ts'ung, or foreign onion, termed also \u56de\u56de\u8525 hui hui ts'ung or Mohammedan onion. The drawing of this plant given in the T'u shu tsi ch'eng [LVII] represents an onion with a globular bulb.\n\nThe ts'ung of the Chinese Classics is, I believe, A. fistulosum. The Rh ya does not mention the cultivated ts'ung, but notices the shan ts'ung or mountain onion [c. supr., 2]. In another section of the Rh ya the character ts'ung is explained by green colour, and in this sense it is understood in the Shi king [286].\n\nThe Li ki speaks repeatedly of the ts'ung as an article of food. I, 79:\u2014Steamed onions. 462:\u2014Mince with onions, onions with lard. 463:\u2014Onions and scallions mixed with brine.13\n\n---\n\n13 Li ki, I, 461, 462:\u2014Vegetables eaten by the ancient Chinese [Legge's translation]. My remarks in brackets.\nThe *Shuo wen* defines the character *ts'ung* by *ts'ai*, vegetable.\n\n*V. supra*, 1-4.\n\n358.\u2014Garlic, *Allium sativum*, L., in Chinese \u849c *suan*, is also known to the Chinese from a very early period. It is mentioned as a vegetable in the Calendar of the *Hia* [121]:\u2014In the 12th month they gather the *suan*, the bulbs of which resemble testicles, \u975b *luan*.\n\nThe *Rh ya* [4] mentions a wild kind of garlic, which is also called *li*. The *Shuo wen* explains the character *suan* by \u8471\u83dc (strong smelling vegetable).\n\nThe *Rh ya cheng i* relates the following tradition:\u2014It once happened, when the Emperor *Huang ti* was ascending the mountain \u85a4\u5c71 *Li shan* [see *Botan. sin.*, I, p. 26, 27] that [some of his followers] were poisoned by the plant \u85a4\u828b *yu yu* (probably an *Liliidea*), but by eating the *suan* plant, which was likewise found there, they were saved. Since that time the *suan* is cultivated in China as a vegetable. It has the property of destroying the noxious effect of putrid meat and fish.\n\nA good drawing of the Garlic plant *suan* is found in *Ch.*, III, 71. *Imen. exot.*, 831, \u849c *suan*, vulgo *jir* and *niniku*. Porrum commune capitatum. According to *Franchet*, *Ningiku* is *A. scorodoprasum*, which plant appears in the *So moku*, VI, 30, under the Chinese name of \u85a4.\n\n*Siebold* [*Syn. plant. econ. jap.*, 90] gives \u5927\u849c (great *suan*) as the Chinese name for garlic in Japan.\n\nThe ancient Chinese authors quoted in *P.*, XXVI, 18, distinguish the \u5c0f\u849c *shao suan*, small garlic, which is said to be that commonly cultivated in China, from the \u5927\u849c *ta*\n\nOnions (\u8471)\u2014scallions [*Allium odorum*, *v. infra*, 359], chives [\u8591, *v. infra*, 360]\u2014mustard [\u82a5, *v. infra*, 362]\u2014lichens [\u829d mushrooms, *v. infra*, 380].\n\nOf spices there are mentioned:\u2014ginger [\u8591, *v. infra*, 381]\u2014cinnamon [\u6842, *v. infra*, 532]\u2014pepper [\u8591 *Zanthoxylon* or *Erodia*, *v. infra*, 498]\u2014smart weed [\u8591 *Polygonum hydropiper*, *v. infra*, 366].\nsuan, or great garlic, known also by the names \u80e1\u849c hu suan, foreign garlic, and \u8471 hu. The Po wen chi [3rd century] states that this latter was introduced into China from the West by the famous general Chang K\u2019ien, in the 2nd century B.C. The Allium scorodoprasum, L., or Rocambole, to which the So mokn refers the hu, is a species allied to the common garlic.\n\n359.\u2014The \u97ed kinu, mentioned in the Classics as a culinary vegetable, is the Allium odoratum, L., (A. oliginosum, G. Don., A. tuberosum, Roxb., A. senescens, Miq., are the same), W.D., 414, calls the kinu erroneously A. setaceum. A. odoratum is a native of Siberia, Mongolia and the whole of China, it seems. It is a common plant in the Peking mountains, and is also much cultivated in Chinese gardens. The Chinese eat the whole plant, especially when in flower in August.\n\nP., XXVI, 1.

Legge thinks that it is a Brassica or mustard plant. W.D., 157, Crucifera, allied to the mustard. Legge observes that in the Japanese plates the feng is a sorrel, Rumex persicaroides. It has an edible root.\n\nShi king, 55:\u2014When we gather the mustard plant (feng) and earth melons [v. infra, 363] we do not reject them because of their roots. 79:\u2014I am going to gather the mustard plant in the east of Mei \u6dee (in the north of Honan). 188:\u2014Gather the mustard plant (feng).\n\nMao says the feng is the same as \u9808 su, which latter, in the Rh ya, is referred to two different plants. Rh ya, 83, we have \u9f8d\u5929\u8591 lung tien go, synonym \u9808\u8591\u5f9e su feng tsung, obscure names not explained by the commentators; and [105] \u9808 su, synonym \u8591\u8591 suu wen.\n\nThe ancient commentators, as quoted in P., XXVI, 36, refer the above names of the Rh ya [83 and 105] both to the feng of the Shi king, which they identify with \u8568\u8591 wu tsing or \u8525\u8591 man tsing, names nowadays applied to the rape turnip, Brassica rapa, L. Other ancient authors say that the su or sun wen [Rh ya, 105] is the \u8cb4 mo of the Shi king, a sorrel, Rumex [v. infra, 441].\n\nThe Fang yen [1st century B.C.] writes the name feng \u8591. It is there stated that this name is applied to the plant in \u9673 Ch'en (Honan) and in \u695a Chu (Hupei, Hunan), whilst in \u9b4f Lu and in \u9f4a T'si (both in Shantung) it is termed \u8591 joo. East and West of the (T'ung knan) Pass (in Southern Shansi and Shensi) it is called \u8568\u8591 wu tsing; in \u8d99 Chao and \u9b4f Wei (Chili and Northern Shansi) the people call it \u5927\u8591 ta kiai (great mustard plant).\n\nLu ki explains \u8591 feng by wu tsing and adds that in \u5ee3\u5dde Yu chou (Northern Chili) it is called \u82a5 kiai.\nLi Shih-ch'en in *P.* [l. c.] states that the *wu tsing*, a vegetable with yellow flowers, is called *man tsing* in the north of China.\n\nW.D., 1040, says that the *man tsing* is a kind of round turnip, whose tuber is above ground and green coloured, common at Peking; a second sort, the *kiui man tsing* has its white tuber under ground. I may observe that Williams' turnip with the tuber above ground is not what the people at Peking call *man tsing*. W. means the cabbage-turnip, Kohl-rabi, *Brassica oleracea caudorapa*, with a round fleshy swelling of the stem near the ground, which is much cultivated in North China. Its popular name is *pie la*. This is, it seems, the plant meant in the figure [Ch., IV, 24] under *\u7518\u84dd kan lan* or *\u82a5\u84dd p'ei lan*. The *wu tsing* or *man tsing* is represented Ch., III, 60. This is, as I have already stated, the rape, *Brassica rapa*, L. It is not grown to a great extent at Peking. D'Incarville, in his list of Peking plants, calls the *man tsing* \"navet\" (turnip). By *kiui man tsing* or mustard rape, Williams means probably a mustard plant with large fleshy roots, of which I shall speak farther on.\n\n*Amam. cot.*, 822, *\u8553\u83dc busai vulgo aona*. *Rapum sativum rotundum*. *Idem radice longa*.

At Peking they cultivate under this name several varieties of Sinapis juncea, L., the typical form of which yields the well-known Russian mustard produced at Sarepta.\n\nOne of these varieties is grown for its seeds, which are used as in Europe; another for its leaves, eaten boiled or as a salad; a third variety, hitherto unknown to our botanists, which I introduced into Europe some years ago, is cultivated for its large turnip-shaped roots, which are pickled and largely used as food. This is called \u5927\u82a5 ta kiai (large mustard).\n\nLi ki, 1, 459, 460 [\"Diet of the Ancient Chinese\"]:\n\nMustard sauce (\u82a5\u9171) with minced fish. 1, 461:\u2014Mince in nutriment was made with the mustard plant (it is not said whether the seeds, the leaves or the roots were employed).\n\nMencius, 190, 194:\u2014The character kiai (mustard) used as a synonym for \u8349 (plant).\n\nThe Fang yen seems to confound the mustard plant with the turnip, for it is there stated (see the passage quoted in 361) that the jeng in Chao and Wei is called ta kiai (great mustard). A smaller variety of it was known by the name \u8f9b\u82a5 sin kiai (pungent mustard) or \u9171\u82a5 yu kiai (mustard from Yu chou or Northern Chili).

Legge calls it the earth melon.\n\nShi king, 55:\u2014When we gather the mustard plant (jeng) and the earth melons (fei) we do not reject them because of their roots.\n\nChu Hi explains:\u2014The leaves, stalks and root of the jeng and fei are all edible; and if sometimes the root or lower part be bad, yet the whole plant is not on that account thrown away.\n\nIn the Conf. Anal. [79] we have the phrase \u975e\u98df\u98f2, which means coarse food and drink.\n\nIn the Rh ya, the character fei is referred to two different plants. In 50 it is identified with \u571f\u74dc kua. Kuo P'o says that this is the \u571f\u74dc t'u kua which latter term Legge translates by \"earth melon;\" but kua is a general name for the fruits of cucurbitaceous plants and may as well be translated by gourd. In P., t'u kua is given as one of the names for Thladiantha dubia, Bge., [r. infra, 386]. The same character [fei] in the Rh ya [106] is identified with \u85e4\u8513 si ts'ai, regarding which Kuo P'o says that it is an edible plant, growing in marshy places and resembling the un tsing (turnip), but it has violet flowers.\n\nMao identifies the fei of the Shi king with \u85e4\u8513 in the Rh ya [50].\n\nLu ki says:\u2014The fei resembles the \u85e4\u8513 [r. infra, 442, Calystegia ?]. It has a coarse stem, thick, long leaves covered with hairs. The people eat it (not said what part of the plant) steamed; it is of an agreeable, sweet taste. In \u96f2\u5dde Yu chou (Northern Chili) they call it wu. In the Rh ya it is si ts'ai. In \u6cb3\u5167 Ho nei (Southern Shansi) it is known by the name of \u5bbf\u8513 su ts'ai.\n\nThe fei is not spoken of in the Pen ts'ao. From the above vague accounts given by the ancient authors regarding this\nplant, it is impossible to guess what it was. Williams [Dict., 138] is of opinion that it is a cruciferous plant, perhaps *Crambe tartarica* (a quite arbitrary identification). Legge has no doubt that the *j\u00e9i* was a kind of radish.\n\nE., 104, family \u83dc, without figure [v. supra, 50].\n\n364.\u2014As has been already noticed [v. 346] the character \u83dc *k'i*, which is met with thrice in the *Shi king*, and which Legge translates invariably by \"white millet,\" has, according to Mao's interpretation, three different meanings in the *Shi*. In the passage p. 284 he makes it to mean a vegetable [v. supra, 24].\n\nLv ki says:\u2014The *k'i* is a vegetable which resembles the \u82e6\u83dc *ku ts'ai* [see 365, *Sowchus* or *Lactuca*]. Its stalk is of a pale green colour. The leaves are succulent, contain a white milky juice, are edible both raw and cooked. The name *k'i* for this plant is usual in \u9752\u5dde Tsing chou (Southern Shantung). The best is found in \u897f\u6cb3 Si ho and \u96c1\u9580 Yen men. The people there (\u571f\u4eba, natives; but another reading has \u80e1\u4eba, foreigners) are very fond of it and do not allow its being exported beyond the frontier.\n\nIn P., XXVII, 17, the *k'i* is identified with the \u767d\u82e3 *pui ki*, a kind of lettuce.\n\nThe Pen ts'ao gives *k'i* also as a synonym for *ti huang*, *Rehmannia glutinosa* [v. supra, 180].\n\n365.\u2014\u8336 *t'u*. The Chinese commentators of the Classics agree that this character in the *Shi* is applied to several distinct plants. More generally it denotes, as Legge correctly states, the sow-thistle, *Sowchus*. Several species of wild-growing *Lactuca* also go under this name.\n\nCompare supra, page 33, where *t'u* is given as a synonym for \u82e6\u83dc *ku ts'ai* (bitter vegetable).\n\n*Shi king*, 56:\u2014Who says that the sow-thistle (*t'u*) is bitter? It is as sweet as the shepherd's purse [*tsi*, v. 367].\n188:\u2014Would you gather the sow-thistle (t'u) at the foot of Shou-yung? 231 [\"Life in Pin\"]:-7th month. They gather the sow-thistle (t'u). 438:\u2014The sow-thistle (t'u) is as sweet as a dumpling. In 525 we have the term \u8336\u6bd2 t'u tu, here meaning figuratively \"bitter and poisonous.\" Chu Hi says:\u2014The t'u is a bitter vegetable, whose taste is bitter and its juice acrid and injurious to life, hence it is called t'u tu.\n\nMao explains t'u in the above passages by k'u ts'ai, as in the Rh ya.\n\nLu ki:\u2014The t'u or k'u ts'ai grows in mountain fields and marshes. After hoar frost the plant becomes sweet, soft and pleasant, which explains the sentence in the Shi \"the t'u is as sweet as a dumpling.\" In the chapter Nei ts'e of the Li ki it is said that sucking-pig was stewed and wrapped up in the leaves of the k'u ts'ai.\n\nThe passage referred to by Lu ki is found in the Li ki [I, 460]. The Chinese text has only \u82e6, the commentators say \u82e6\u83dc is meant, and K'ung Ying-ta explains that the Sonchus leaves drive away the bad smell.\n\nLi ki, I, 268, [Yue ling]:\u2014First month of summer. The sow-thistle (k'u ts'ai) is in seed.\n\nChou li, II, 509:\u2014Blancheur du jus de la plante tou (\u8336).\n\nCalendar of the Ilia [57]:\u20144th month. Collected are the sow-thistles (t'u); [89]:\u20147th month. Luxuriant are the sow-thistles.\n\nIn the Shi king [146] t'u means flowering rushes. Legge translates:\u2014The girls were like flowering rushes (t'u). Mao explains here t'u by \u8336 (unknown to me,\u2014the first character denotes a water-plant, Euryale ferox). Cheng Huan explains it by \u8336\u79c0 (flowering mao grass) [c. infra, 460]. T'u has the same meaning in the Shi [p. 234], where Mao explains it by \u8336\u82e6, which latter term is referred by K'ung Ying-ta to the Rh ya [214] (rushes). \u82e6 stands for \u82e6, see the Rh ya [209, 210].\nTu has the same meaning in the Chou li [I, 381]. Le propos\u00e9 \u00e0 la plante tou (\u8336) est charg\u00e9 de r\u00e9unir dans leur saison les plantes tou, pour les employer dans les c\u00e9r\u00e9monies fun\u00e8bres. Cheng Huan here explains tu by \u8305\u79c0, (flowering rushes) as above. Biot reads mao jou and identifies it with Sonchus.\n\nFinally, the character tu appears in the Shi king [604] coupled with liao, \u8336\u8513, which Mao explains by \u6c34\u8349 (water-plant), and Legge renders by \"smart weed,\" Polygonum persicaria. Chu Hi observes that tu and liao are the same plant, called tu in the dry soil, liao in the wet, and not to be confounded with the tu or k'iu ts'ai (sow-thistle).\n\nSee regarding the k'iu ts'ai or tu, P., XXVII, 14. The plant figured under these names in Ch., III, 15, seems to be Lactuca versicolor, Sch. Bip. Henry [l. c., 189]:\u2014k'iu ts'ai in Hupei is Lactuca squarrosa, Miq.\n\nSiebold [Sya. plant acron. jap., 219]:\u2014\u82e6\u83dc kesi asani, Sonchus oleraceus, L., Herba edulis.

[See Henry, l. c., 239.] Legge renders liao by \"smart weed,\" Polygonum persicaria. The character liao appears twice in the Shi king. In 600 it is used in the sense of \"bitter experience,\" and in 604 it is coupled with tu [see 365].\n\nMao explains liao by \"water-plant,\" (Cheng Huan by \u82e6\u4e4b\u83dc (pungent and bitter vegetable). [See also the Rh ya, 65].\n\nLi ki, I, 460, 461 [\"Diet of the Ancient Chinese\"]:\n\nThe liao mentioned as a spice: a sucking-pig was stewed, wrapped up in Sonchus leaves and stuffed with smart-weed.\n\nP., XVI, 76, liao.

It possesses an abundance of mucilage, and the Chinese use it as a pot-herb.\n\nP., XVI, 22:\u2014K'ui, also \u51ac\u8475 t'ung k'ui (winter-mallow) and \u6ed1\u83dc hua ts'ai (mucilaginous vegetable).

In the Japanese plates it is a hollyhock.\n\nShi king, 207:\u2014A gentleman of a party addresses a lady: \"I look on you as the flower of the thorny mallow (kiao).\"\n\nRhya, 76, where p'i fou is given as a synonym for kiao.\n\nLu ki:\u2014The kiao is also called \u82b1\u83dc p'i fou and \u834a\u8475 king k'ui.\n\nThe plant resembles the un tsing (turnip) [v. supra, 361], is edible and slightly bitter. Its flowers are greenish violet.\n\nThis plant is, according to K.K.F.P., XLVI, 23, the same as the \u9326\u8475 kin k'ui or Malva sylvestris, L., also a common plant in North China. Good drawings of it in Ch., III, 6, and the So moku, XII, 57, under the above Chinese name.\n\nMedhurst and Legge are mistaken in translating king k'ui by \"thorny mallow.\" \u834a king is the name of a plant (Vitex) but its original meaning is that of one of the nine ancient divisions of China (Hunan and Hupei), and in this sense the king is here to be taken.

See the Li ki, II, 185 [Mourning Rites]:\u2014The body of a great officer was laid on a mat of typha grass (\u84b2\u5e2d).\n\nIn P., XIX, 15, the pou of the Classics is identified with the \u9999\u84b2 huang pou (fragrant pou), which is the common name for the reed-mace Typha latifolia, L., the young shoots of which are eaten, and the leaves used for making mats. The mace, or rather the pollen, is \u84b2\u9ec3 pou huang. Rude figures of the plant in the Kiu hua, LIII, 12, and in Ch., XVIII, 4.

In \u5468 Chou and \u79e6 Ts'in (Southern Shensi and Eastern Kansu) they call it k\u016be, in \u9f4a Ts'i and \u9b6f Lu (both in Shantung) it is pie. When it first begins to grow it resembles the foot of the turtle called pie, whence the name. Its stem is of a dark purple colour. The plant is eaten like the kui or mallow.\n\nP., XXVII, 25:\u2014The k\u016be is described as a common mountain plant. The young leaves are rolled up and resemble a child's fist. When expanded they resemble the tail of a phoenix. The stalks are cooked for food.

He relies for this identification upon Chu Hi, who says that the wei resembles the kue but that it is rather longer and has spinous points and a bitter taste. But Chu seems to be mistaken, for none of the earlier commentators on the Shi king ventured to refer the wei to a fern. Mao says simply it is a vegetable, the Rh ya [167] states only that it grows by the edge of the water; the Shuo wen says it is a vegetable which resembles the \u85dc ho [v. supra, 354], thus it may be supposed that it is a leguminous plant.\n\nLu ki states:\u2014The wei is a mountain vegetable. It is a creeper, in its stem and in the leaves it resembles the \u5c0f \u8c46 siao tou [Phaseolus Mungo, v. supra, 355]. It resembles this latter plant also in taste. The leaves are eaten both raw and cooked. Nowadays it is grown in the government's gardens and used at the sacrifices in the ancestral temple.\n\nP., XXVII, 26, describes the wei as a leguminous plant, also called \u91ce \u8c46 ye wau tou (wild pea) and eaten as a pot-herb.\n\nThe drawing in Ch., IV, 19, representing the wei, is rude, only leaves which seem to refer to a leguminous plant.\n\nAt Peking the name wei is applied to Vicia gigantea, Bge. The \u91ce \u8c46 in the So moku [XIII, 12] is Lathyrus maritimus, Bigel.\n\nI may, however, observe that in Japan, the Chinese character \u85af, in accordance with Chu Hi's view, is applied\nto a fern. The Phon zo [XLIX, 29, 30] figures under this name Osmunda regalis, L. But this plant also has no thorns.\n\nThere is a plant which in China and Japan is termed \u767d\u8587 (the white wei). The So moku [IV, 26-29, 31] figures under this name various species of Vincetoxicum.\n\nJap., 1538, Osmunda regalis, L., var. japonica, Milde, \u8594\u8587.\n,, 2330, Vincetoxicum atratum, Morr. & Decn., \u767d\u8587.

Kuo P'o says that it has an edible root, resembling that of the \u7f8a\u8e44 yang ti (Rumex). In Kiangnan the name is written \u85af\u8a9e shu yu. The root is light or heavy.\n\nThe Kuang ya writes \u85af\u85ac shu yu, and with the latter name it is described in P., XXVII, 33, as a climbing plant, both wild and cultivated, with edible roots, a purple stem, shining three-cornered leaves resembling those of the \u725b\u5c3e kien nin (Pharbitis triloba); flowers in spikes, followed by three-angled capsules. The seeds are produced by the side; they are of various sizes, greater and smaller, resembling the nodules of the \u96f7\u4e38 lei wan (Mylitta lapidescens). [The Chinese authors mean, it seems, axillary bulbils, not seeds.] The plant is also called \u5c71\u85e5 shan yao (mountain drug) and \u5c71\u828b shan yu (mountain taro).\n\nShan yao is nowadays the common name in North China for the cultivated yam, Dioscorea japonica, Thbg. In other parts of China the same name is applied to D. Batatas, Dene., and other species. Henry, l.c., 412:\u2014Shan yao in Hupei is D. quinqueloba, Thbg., also D. japonica.

[Comp. W.D., 466].\n\nThe Shuo wen explains \u74dc by \u74dc, but evidently \u863f lo is meant, which, by an ancient author quoted in K.D., is said to denote fruits which ripen on the ground. The term refers especially to cucurbitaceous plants.\n\nThe early Chinese commentators on the Classics do not give any more exact definition of the character \u74dc occurring so frequently in the Classics. Legge translates it variously by melon, gourd, cucumber; Biot and Douglas by melon.\n\nShi king, 231 [\"Life in Pin\"]:-In the seventh month they eat the melons. 375:-In the midst of the fields are the huts, and along the bounding divisions are gourds, and the fruit is sliced and pickled. 469:-The gourds planted by Hou Tsi yielded abundantly. 437:-In long trains ever increasing grow the gourds and the tie [see farther on].\nLi ki, I, 82:\u2014He who pares a melon for the Son of Heaven should divide it into four parts and then into eight and cover them with a napkin of fine linen. I, 307 [Yueh ling]: Melons. I 433:\u2014The Son of Heaven planted gourds. I 461 [\"Dict of the Ancient Chinese\"]:\u2014Cucumbers (\u74dc).\n\nCalendar of the Hia, 65:\u2014Fifth month. Clothed are the melons. 91:\u2014Ninth month. Sliced are the melons.\n\nIn the text of the Chou li the character \u74dc does not appear, it seems. The character \u846b occurs there once [I, 383] and Biot translates it by \"fruits sans noyaux.\" Commentator B, (Cheng Hi-an) dit \u74dc melons, \u5947 citronilles.\n\nIn P., XXXIII, 1 article \u74dc tien kua (sweet kua), nowadays the common name for melons, also \u74dc kan kua, which has the same meaning. Li Shi-ch'en suggests that the kua mentioned in the above-quoted passage from the Li ki [I, 82] was a melon. He seems to be right. But as to the other quotations we are left in doubt whether the kua there mentioned were melons or what we call pumpkins, gourds, squashes, i.e., species of the genus Cucurbita. Nowadays the Chinese cultivate throughout the empire the Cucurbita maxima or Melon Pumpkin (the potiron of the French), the C. Pepo or Pumpkin gourd, and C. moschata. Of the C. maxima they have many varieties, varying considerably in size and shape of the fruit and in the colour of the skin. At Peking they are called \u5357\u74dc nan kua and \u756a\u74dc fan kua. They are generally of large size, but there is also a variety which is not larger than a peach. It is called \u6843\u5152\u7d05\u5357\u74dc, t'ao rh hung nan kua, red peach pumpkin. Cucurbita moschata is \u5091\u74dc wo kua. The Benincasa cerifera, \u51ac\u74dc tung kua, is also much grown in China.

See Botan.sin., I, p. 24]. In the 4th century the name hu kua was changed into \u9ec3\u74dc huang kua (yellow kua) which is still the Chinese name for the cucumber in China and Japan. Ch., IV, 48. So maku, XX, 38.\n\nThe water melon, \u897f\u74dc xi kua (Western melon) was introduced into China in the 10th century from the country of the Ki tan (Eastern Mongolia and Manchuria). The Ki tan had previously brought this fruit from the country of the Hul ho (Uigurs). For further details see the Wu tai shi, quoted in K.K.F.P., LXVII, 16, and P., XXXIII, 6. Ch., XXXI, 28. So moku, XX, 43.\n383.\u2014Twice in the text of the *Shi king* we find the characters \u74dc\u85e4 *kua* and \u85e4 associated. Page 469:\u2014Legge translates *kua* \u85e4 by gourds (\"the gourds planted by Hou Tsi yielded abundantly.\") Page 437, he renders the same term by \"the gourds and the \u85e4.\"\n\nThe \u85e4 is given in the *Rh ya* [58] as a synonym for \u85e4.\n\nLegge explains the character \u85e4 (after Chu Hi it seems) as meaning the gourd near the root, where it begins, very small as compared with the *kua* when it has grown and extended with a vast development of tendrils and leaves. I prefer to this obscure explanation, the definition given by K'ung Ying-ta, who states that in the Han dynasty the term \u85e4 was applied to the small *kua*, \u5c0f\u74dc, whilst by \u5927\u74dc the large kinds were denoted. But here again it is impossible to decide whether gourds or melons are meant. The Chinese cultivate small varieties of *Cucurbita maxima* and have also melons of a very small size.\n\n384.\u2014\u74e0 *hu*; \u74e0 *hu* (it means a pot, and is also written \u74e0), \u74e0 *p'ao* and \u74e0 *p'iao*.\n\nAll these names in the Classics refer to *Lagenaria vulgaris*, L., the Calabash or Bottle gourd and its varieties. Legge translates them by bottle gourd, gourd, melon; Biot by \"citrouille\" (*pumpkin*) [Chou li, I, 383, note].\n\nLi ki, I, 307 [Yue ling]:\u2014Melons (\u74dc) and gourds (\u74e0).\n\n*Shi king*, 420:\u2014Of the gourd (\u74e0) leaves some are taken and boiled. 271:\u2014In the south are trees with curved drooping branches and the sweet gourds (\u7518\u74e0) cling to them. Chu Hi explains that there are sweet and bitter *hu*. 95:\u2014Her (a lady's) teeth were like melon-seeds \u9ebb\u5c51. The second character here stands for \u9ebb\u5c51. See the *Rh ya* [21]. Chu Hi explains:\u2014The section of a melon showing the seeds regular and white.\nShi king, 231 [\"Lito in Pin\"]:-In the eighth month they cut down the bottle-gourd \u846b\u82a6. Chu Hi explains:\u2014Same as \u846b\u82a6.\n\nLegge, Shi king [53] says:\u2014The \u846b\u82a6 p'ao in the Shi king is no doubt the bottle-gourd, called also hu and hu lu. When the fruit has become thoroughly hard and ripe, the shell, emptied of its contents, can be used as a bladder. We often see one or more tied to boat-children on the Chinese rivers, to keep them afloat, should they fall into the water.\n\nShi king, 53:\u2014The gourd (\u74e0) has still its bitter leaves and the crossing at the ford is deep. Mao explains:\u2014The p'ao is the same as the \u74e0 hu. Its leaves are bitter, cannot be eaten. Chu Hi says:\u2014The fruit was not yet hard enough to serve the purpose of a bladder in crossing a stream.\n\nLu ki says:\u2014The young leaves of the p'ao are eaten. The people prepare from them a soup of a very pleasant taste. The people from Honan to Yang chou (Chekiang and Anhui) eat these leaves till the eighth month, when they become bitter, wherefore the Shi says the p'ao has its bitter leaves.\n\nShi king, 487:\u2014He poured out his spirits into calabashes (p'ao), i.e., Duke Liu, the ancestor of the Chou. Cheng Huan explains:\u2014They used calabashes for cups to drink.\n\nConf. Anal., 185:\u2014Am I a bitter gourd (\u74e0\u74dc)? How can I be hung up out of the way of being eaten?\n\nIbidem, 52:\u2014Admirable was the virtue of Hu, with a single bamboo-dish of rice and a single gourd-dish of drink \u2014\u74e0\u98f2.\n\nThe Ku kin chu explains that p'ao is a kind of hu or bottle gourd. The term is also applied to a drinking vessel made of it.\n\nThe Pi ya [11th century] states that the above names referring to the bottle gourd are not synonyms but names\nfor distinct varieties. That with a long fruit tapering towards the upper end (the stalk) is \u982d hu; it is sweet; that having a short fruit with a large belly is the \u8179 p'ao. The \u982d hu resembles the p'ao but is of a more globular shape.\n\nAt Peking the name \u74f6\u5b50 hu ts'e is applied to a Lagenaria with a large club-shaped fruit from 2 to 3 feet long. The varieties of the bottle-gourd with smaller fruits, pear-shaped or oblong and narrowed in the middle (with a \u8170 or waist as the Chinese say) are called \u74f6 hu lu.\n\nSee with respect to the bottle-gourd P., XXVIII, 4, 6, 9. Compare also Amoen. cot., 810, 811, So moku, XX, 46, 47, and Phon zo, LII, 17-23, where different varieties of the bottle-gourd, cultivated in Japan, are described and figured under the above-mentioned Chinese names.\n\nLagenaria vulgaris, L., \u982d and 20 other names, v.

LEGGE calls it the heavenly gourd, and says that in the Japanese plates it is the musk melon.\n\nShi king, 236:\u2014The fruit of the heavenly gourd would be hanging about our eaves.\n\nComp. the Rh ya [23]. Kuo P'o calls this plant \u5929\u74dc tien kua or heavenly gourd.\n\nK'ung Ying-ta says:\u2014According to the Rh ya, it is the fruit of the \u683c\u6a13 kua lou, but Li Sun says that the name is applied to the seeds. The Pen ts'ao says the kuo lo has leaves like the kua (gourd). They come out two and two, opposite to each other. It is a twining plant. The flowers appear in the sixth, the fruits in the seventh month. The fruit is like a gourd.\n\nP., XVIIIa, 34 [Kua lou]:\u2014The ancient authors quoted there describe it as a climbing plant with lobed leaves, pale yellow flowers resembling those of the hu lu (Lagenaria). Globular orange-coloured fruit of the size of a fist. The root\ncontains a white flour which is used in medicine, as is also\nthe fruit. Figured Ch., XXII, 27. Kiu huang, LIII, 18.\n\nAt Peking the kua lou is the Trichosanthes Kirilowii,\nMaxim., a cucurbitaceous plant spread over the whole of\nChina. It is a beautiful plant, winding itself round the\nstems and branches of trees. Five-lobed leaves, fragrant\nwhite flowers beautifully fringed. In autumn the orange-\ncoloured globular fruits of the size of a man's fist hang grace-\nfully down from the branches on long slender stalks. The\nname kua lou may perhaps be also applied to other species\nof Trichosanthes.\n\nSo maku, XX, 35:\u2014\u6854 \u6a39 Trichosanthes japonica, Rgl.\nPhon zo, XXVII, 12, same Chinese name, Tr. japonica,\nand 11 tubers and fruit of Tr. multiloba, Miq.\n\nE., 151, family \u6854 \u6a39, has a figure of Trichosanthes multiloba,\nMiq.

The\nroyal melons grow. Cheng Huan explains wuang kua by\n\u8349 \u83dc pi kie, and refers to the Calendar of the Hia [56],\nwhere we read:\u2014In the 4th month \u738b \u8cb4 \u8349 [Douglas\ntranslates] reign the grass and the yu weed. I do not agree\nwith Douglas's translation. It seems to me that Biot, who\ntranslates: \"la grande courge wuang jou fleurit,\" is nearly\ncorrect. Evidently this sentence in the Hia Calendar\n4th month, corresponds to the above-quoted in the Yue ling,\nfirst month of summer, where no doubt a cucurbitaceous\nplant is spoken of, which CHENG HUAN supposes to be the same as the \u738b \u85e4 wong fu of the Hia Calendar. \u738b fu is the name of a weed. But the Chinese commentator on the Hia Calendar is right in assuming that fu is a mistake for \u738b sia (to flourish).\n\nLater commentators identify CHENG HUAN's pi kie with the plant \u85e4 \u85e4 pa kia of the Pen ts'ao, which seems to be Smilax China, L. P., XVIIIb, 3. Root used in medicine. The drawing of the pa kia in Ch., XXII, 53, agrees well with the figure given by KEMPFER in Linnan, exot. [782] and with the above Chinese characters added. The plant represented there is Smilax China, L.\n\nOther Chinese commentators refer, with respect to the wong kua, to the Rh ya [34 and 152]. The name seems to be applied to several plants.\n\nThe plant described in P., XVIIIa, 40, under the name \u738b \u85e4 wong kua, also called \u8d64 \u85e4 chi pao, and figured Ch., XXII, 30, is Thladiantha dubia, Bge., a beautiful cucurbitaceous climber of North China. It produces in summer a profusion of yellow flowers which are followed by small oblong red fruits. The name chi pao, usual at Peking, means \"red hail stone.\" The tuberous root of the plant is mealy and used in medicine. I suspect this was the royal melon of the Classics.\n\nIn Japan, where, it seems, the genus Thladiantha is not represented, the Chinese name \u738b \u85e4 is applied to Trichosanthes cucumeroides, Ser. [See So moku, XX, 34].\n\nE., 146, family \u85e4 \u85e4, with two figures of Smilax. \u738b \u85e4 is a synonym. Jap., 2096.\n\nE., 133, family \u9060 \u85e4 [v. 194] Polysata. \u738b \u85e4 is mentioned as a synonym.\n\n387.\u2014\u82e6 \u85e4 K'u kua, bitter gourd.\n\nShi king, 237:\u2014The bitter gourds hanging down from the chestnut tree.\nK'ua kua is now the name applied in China as well as in Japan to *Momordica charantia*, L. The fruit of this cucurbitaceous plant is bitter and covered with little wart-like protuberances, wherefore the Chinese call it also \u75a3\u74dc (leprosy gourd). *P.*, XXVIII, 21; *Ch.*, V, 6; *So moku*, XX, 36.\n\nLi Shih-ch'en, however, does not mean to identify the k'ua kua of our days with that of the *Shi king*, proving that *Momordica* is not indigenous to China but was introduced from the south.\n\n---\n\nIV.\u2014Textile Plants.\n\n388.\u2014The character \u7ea1 ma, which nowadays is a generic term for plants yielding textile fibres, was in ancient times applied exclusively to the common hemp plant, *Cannabis sativa*, L. As is well-known, its flowers are of separate sexes on different plants. The male plant was called \u85dc si or i. In the *Rh ya* [104] this character is given as a synonym for \u7ea1. The female or seed-bearing plant was \u85dc tshu. The *Rh ya* [140] gives \u85dc jen as a name for hemp-seed.\n\nThe *Lu shi* [Sung dynasty] relates a tradition according to which the Emperor SHEN NUNG [28th century B.C.] first taught the people to cultivate the ma, or hemp, and the mulberry tree, for making hempen and silken cloth (*fu pu* and *fu po*).\n\nThe *Rh ya* [12th century] says the ma is used for food [the seed] as well as for making cloth (*fu*) from its fibres. The plant which bears seed is called tshu, that which has no seed is si.\n\nAs hemp-seed was an article of food, the hemp in ancient times was reckoned as one of the five, or nine, kinds of grain [*c. supra*, 335].\nLi ki, I, 284 [Yue ling]:\u2014First month of autumn. The Son of Heaven eats hemp-seed with dog's flesh. Same statement [289, 291] for the second and third months of autumn. The text has only ma (hemp). Legge translates hemp-seed on the authority of the Chinese commentators.\n\nIbidem I, 88. [\"Rules for the Period of Mourning\"]:\u2014A man of seventy will only wear the unhemmed dress of sack-cloth (ma). I, 143:\u2014At the mourning rites for Hui tszi, Tze yu went to condole, wearing for him a robe of sackcloth (\u9ebb\u8863) and a headband made of the product of the male [hemp] plant (\u7261\u9ebb\u7d43). II, 49, 388:\u2014Mourning attire, hempen cloth, hempen dress (ma). I, 479:\u2014A girl of the age of ten was taught to learn women's work, to handle the hempen fibres (\u9ebb\u67b2), to deal with the cocoon, etc. I, 369:\u2014The ancient kings knew not yet the use of flax (ma) and silk (\u7d72), but clothed themselves with feathers and skins. The later sages then arose . . . they dealt with the flax and silk so as to form linen and silken fabrics.\n\nChou li, I, 163:\u2014Le directeur du chanvre (\u5178\u67b2) est pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au chanvre (\u9ebb) et aux diverses plantes (\u8349) pour faire les toiles ordinaires (\u5e03), les toiles \u00e0 15 largeurs de fils (\u7e10), les toiles en filasse (\u7e10) et les toiles claires (\u7d17). Kia Kung-yen explains that all these fabrics were made of ma or hemp, with the exception of the \u7d79 chun, which was made of \u85e4. [Other textile plants, see infra.]\n\nShi king, 122:\u2014On the mound where is the hemp (ma). 156:\u2014How do you proceed in planting hemp (ma)? The\n\n---\n\n17 Flax, Linum sativum, I., was unknown to the ancient Chinese. It is nowadays cultivated in the mountains of North China (probably also in other parts of the empire) and in Southern Mongolia, but only for the oil of the seeds, not for its fibres. The Chinese call it hu ma (foreign hemp). P. does not speak of it. Its introduction must be of more recent date. In Ch., II, 31, is a good drawing of the plant under the name \u5c71\u897f\u80e1\u9ebb Shan si hu ma (foreign hemp of Shansi).\nacres must be dressed lengthwise and crosswise. 205:\u2014She leaves twisting her hemp (ma). 208:\u2014The moat at the eastern gate is fit to steep hemp (ma) in. 221:\u2014A robe of hemp (ma) like snow. 232 [\"Life in Pin\"]:\u2014The harvest is collected, hemp (ma) and other grains and vegetables. 469:\u2014The hemp (ma) planted by Hou Tsi [c. supra, 343] grew strong and close.\n\nMencius, 132:\u2014Hemp (ma).\n\nConf. Ana., 81:\u2014The Master said, the linen cap (\u9ebb\u5195 hempen cap) is that prescribed by the rules of ceremony.\n\nChou li, I, 27:\u2014Les femmes l\u00e9gitimes (femmes du premier rang) transforment par leur travail la soie (\u7d72) et le chanvre (\u6851). II, 269:\u2014Le commerce de la province de \u912d\u5dde Yu tcheon (Honan) consiste en bois de bambou, en vernis, en soie, en chanvre (\u6851).\n\nShu king, 102, 117:\u2014[Tribute of Y\u00fc.] Hemp (\u6851) mentioned as a product of the provinces of \u912d\u5dde Yu chou and \u9752\u5dde Tsing chou (Honan, Anhui).\n\nLi ki, II, 384:\u2014[\"Mourning Rites\"]:\u2014The head band worn with the frayed sacketloth, for a father when mourning, must be made of the fibres of the female [hemp] plant (\u9ebb ts\u00fc). Legge states (on the authority of the Chinese commentator):\u2014The fibres of the male and the female hemp plant are both dark coloured, those of the female plant being the darker. The cloth woven of them was also of a coarser texture.\n\nShi king, 231 [\"Life in Pin\"]:\u2014In the ninth month they gather the hemp-seed (ts\u00fc).\n\nThe character \u9ebb jen has several meanings. In the Rh ya [298] it means exuberance of fruit, and in the same sense it occurs in the Shi king, 109. But in the Chou li [I, 107] the character denotes hemp-seed:\u2014Les paniers de la c\u00e9r\u00e9monie du matin sont remplis de bl\u00e9 m\u00fbr (\u7a40), de la graine de chanvre (\u6851), de riz, de millet, etc. Cheng Sz-sung\nexplains *fen* by hemp-seed, as in the *Rh ya* [104] the character \u9ebb *fen* is explained. In another place in the *Chou li* [I, 365] *fen* has the meaning of \"extrait de chanvre,\" as Biot translates, used as manure.\n\nIn the *Li ki* the *fen* is noticed as an article of food. The Chinese commentators explain it by \u5927\u9ebb\u5b50 hemp-seed. I cannot understand why Legge [l.c., I, 451] translates *fen* by spinach. He confounded it perhaps with \u82a5, which is *Amaranthus Blitum*.\n\nLegge defines the character \u5e03 *pu*, frequently met with in the Classics, by \"cloth,\" without saying of what material; Biot by \"toile ordinaire.\" See the above-quoted passage from the *Chou li* [I, 163], from which it would appear that *pu* in ancient times denoted only hempen fabrics. Besides this, the *Shuo wen* explains *pu* by \u7d20\u7e54 or (cloth) woven of hemp. Nowadays *pu* is a general term for cotton, hempen and other textile fabrics.18\n\nP., XXII, 11, calls the hemp plant \u5927\u9ebb *ta ma*, the great hemp, a name given to it in the *Shen nung pen ts'ao*. The *Rh ya i* [12th century] terms it \u6f22\u9ebb *han ma*, or Chinese hemp, in opposition to the \u80e1\u9ebb *hu ma*, or foreign hemp, the *Sesamum orientale*, a plant introduced from Western Asia in the 2nd century B.C. A good drawing of *Cannabis sativa*, under *ta ma* is given in Ch., I, 3. But at Peking the popular name of the hemp plant, which is also found there in a wild state, is \u5c0f\u9ebb *sia ma* small hemp, whilst the name of *ta ma* is incorrectly applied by the people.\n\n---\n\n18 Cotton, nowadays the most important among the textile materials produced in China, was unknown to the ancient Chinese. It was only about A.D. 1000 that this useful plant became fully introduced into the Southern Provinces of China, from Cochinchina. It is mentioned several centuries earlier in the Chinese annals as a product of foreign countries (Southern Asia and Central Asia). See the late W. F. Meyers' interesting paper on the subject in *Notes and Queries on China and Japan*, 1838, p. 72,\nto the *Ricinus* plant, the book name of which is \u83dc\u9ebb pi ma. Hemp in Northern China is also called \u7ebf\u9ebb sien ma. The first character means cord, lines.\n\n*Amane, exot.* [897] \u9ebb ba and ma, vulgo asa, *Cannabis sativa*.

Cheng Sz-yung remarks that the plants k'iang [Bior writes king] and cha [tchou, see 391] are meant.\n\nThe *Rh ya i* [12th century] says that this is the same as \u85e4\u9ebb k'iang ma. Another name is \u85e4\u9ebb k'iang, of which the *Shuo wen* states that it is a kind of hemp.\n\nThese names are now applied to the *Abutilon Ivicenna*, Gerl., (*Sida tiliifolia*, Fish.) a common plant in Northern China, wild and cultivated.

Legge is of opinion [Shi king, 6] that it is a general name for the Dolichos tribe, and in the Shi king, where this character occurs about twenty times, he identifies it with the Dolichos tuberosus, of whose fibres a kind of cloth is made. Sometimes he terms it also grass-cloth.\n\nLi ki, I, 169:\u2014At the interment they used the cap of plain white silk and the head-band of Dolichos fibre (ko).

Legge (following the Chinese commentator), Shoes thinly woven of the Dolichos fibre may be used to walk on the hoar frost. Cheng Huan [Chou li, I, 168]:\u2014En \u00e9t\u00e9 on porte des souliers tiss\u00e9s en plante ko, en hiver des souliers de peau.\n\nChou li, I, 379:\u2014Le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 aux plantes textiles ko (\u845b) est charg\u00e9 de recueillir \u00e0 diverses \u00e9poques les mati\u00e8res qui servent \u00e0 faire des toiles fines (\u7d72) et grossi\u00e8res (\u7d72) et qui sont fournies par les cultivateurs des montagnes.

Legge translates sometimes fine and coarse linen, sometimes grass-cloth.\n\nShih king, 6:\u2014See quotation above.\n\nShu king, 102, 117 [Tribute of Y\u00fc]:\u2014The ch'i mentioned as an article of tribute of the provinces of \u9752\u5dde Tsing chou and \u5ef6\u5dde Yu chou (Anhui, Houan), the ki only for Yu chou.

It grows wild in the mountains and is also much cultivated for the textile fibres of its stem as well as for its tuberous and farinaceous roots, which furnish an article of food. The fibres made of the ko fibres are still much prized in China. The botanical name of this plant is Pachyrhizus Thunbergianus, S. & Z., also Pueraria Thunbergiana, Benth. Thunberg described it first as Dolichos hirsutus.\n\nThe ko plant is described P., XVIIa, 12. Good drawing Ch., XXII, 33.

Legge [Shi king, 209] says it is described as a species of hemp, a perennial, and not raised every year from seed. In the Japanese plates it is evidently the Boehmeria or nettle from which grass-cloth is made. But as the radical of the above character indicates, this is not the name of the plant itself but of the fabric woven of its fibres. The Shuo wen refers it erroneously to the \u7d21 (which, as we have seen, is Abutilou) and says that the fine cloth made of it is called \u7d21 t'uan, the coarser \u7d21 chu. Later authors take these fabrics to be derived from the \u8349 ch'u plant, which is Boehmeria nivea, Hook & Arn. This latter name ch'u for the grass-cloth plant appears in the Pie lu [5th century] but it was much earlier in use. [V. infra, 458].\n\nShi king, 208:\u2014The moat at the east gate is fit to steep the Boehmeria (\u7d21).\n\nLu ki:\u2014The \u7d21 chu is a kind of hemp (ma). Numerous stems come out from the same root, which is perennial, and in spring young plants shoot forth again without being raised from seed. In \u8346\u5dde King chon (Hukuang) and \u63da\u5dde Yang chon (Chekiang, Anhui) there are three crops in one year. Now the government raises this plant in gardens. An iron or bamboo knife is used to strip off the bark. After the thick outer bark has been scraped off, they get to the soft but tough fibres of the inner bark, which are boiled and then twisted and manufactured into cloth (\u7d21). This fabric is used for garments all over southern China \u5357\u8d8a (Nan y\u00fce).\nPLANTS MENTIONED IN CLASSICAL WORKS.\n\nShu king 117 [Tribute of Y\u00fc] :-The chu mentioned as a product of \u6cb3\u5357 Y\u00fc chou (Honan). Legge translates incorrectly coarser hemp cloth.\n\nIn the text of the Chou li the character chu occurs once [I, 163]. See the quotation above under 388. Biot translates \"toiles claires.\" This fabric is twice mentioned by the Chinese commentators on the Chou li [I, 32] where Biot translates \"\u00e9toffes fines de soie,\" and [I, 379] tehau.\n\nP., XV, 51, Ch'a ma, Boehmeria nivea.

In the Hua\u00ef man tsz' [2nd century B.C.] we read \u9752\u51fa\u65bc\u85cd, the blue colour is yielded by the lan (plant). The Shuo wen defines lan by \u67d3\u9752\u8349 a plant (or plants) which dyes a blue colour. But nowadays the principal meaning of lan is \"blue, a blue colour.\"\n\nWe meet several times with the term lan in the Chinese Classics. Legge translates it by Indigo plant.\n\nShi king, 412 :\u2014All the morning I gather the Indigo plant.\n\nLi ki, I, 274 [Yue ling] :\u2014Second month of summer. The people are forbidden to cut down the Indigo plant (lan) to use it for dyeing.\nChou li, I, 380:\u2014Le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 aux plantes de teinture, \n\u638c\u67d3\u8349, est charg\u00e9 de recueillir au printemps et en automne \nles esp\u00e8ces de plantes qui servent \u00e0 la teinture. The text of \nthe Chou li does not give the names of these plants, but the \nearly commentators supply them.

Biot has:\u2014S\u00e9parez (coupez) la plante lan liao \n(Indigo) qui est en pleine croissance.\n\nBiot is correct in taking lan liao to be one name. It is \nthe Polygonum tinctorium [see farther on].\n\nSee also the Rh ye, 178, una lan.\n\nThe Chinese dyeing drug which in commerce goes under \nthe name of Indigo [Reports on Trade of the Chinese Mari-\ntime Customs] is yielded by distinct plants in different parts \nof China. The blue dye-stuff properly called Indigo is \nprepared from the leaves of Indigofera tinctoria, L., a legu-\nminous shrub cultivated from immemorial times in India \nand the warmer parts of Asia. I. Anil, L., a larger plant, \nalso generally cultivated in warm countries for the production \nof indigo, is supposed to be of American origin. The late \nDr. Hance wrote me that this species is frequently seen in \nSouthern China. Loureiro [Flora cochin., 560] mentions \nI. tinctoria as cultivated in South China under the names \nlan tsao, ta cim (ts\u2019ing). As the true Indigo plant is a \ntropical species, it is never met with in the northern part of \nChina. I am not aware how far to the north its cultivation \nin China extends.\n\nPolygonum tinctorium mentioned by Loureiro [l. c., 297] \nas a plant yielding Indigo at Canton, is grown also in the \nnorthern provinces, especially near Peking, where it is called \nlan. Debeaux [Flore de Chunghai, 52] found it cultivated \nnear Shanghai. This plant is a native of China and is grown,\nit seems, all over the empire. It is also cultivated in Japan, but, as Miquel (quoted by Siebold) states, it was introduced from China.\n\nA third Chinese Indigo plant is the *Isatis indigofera* of Fortune, a cruciferous plant, first observed by that meritorious traveller in the vicinity of Shanghai, where he found it cultivated as a tinctorial plant under the name of *tien ching*. It seems to me that F. has reversed the name, and that \u9752\u975b *tsing tien* [r. infra] is meant. According to Mr. Hemsley [*Index Flore Sin.*, 49] Fortune's plant is only a variety of our common European Dyer's Woad, *Isatis tinctoria*, L.\n\nLastly, Fortune describes an acanthaceous plant extensively cultivated in the Chekiang Province for producing indigo. This is the *Strobilanthes flaccidifolius*, Nees., grown also near Canton and in Assam. Mr. Bullock [letter 1881] saw it near Pakhoi. This is Fortune's *Ruellia indigotica*.\n\nP., XVI, 74, lan. An author of the 7th century quoted, who states that there are three kinds of *lan* in China from which the \u85cd\u67d3 *lan tien* or Indigo is extracted (the second character is more generally written \u85cd *tien*) one is the \u6728\u85cd *mu lan* or tree *lan*, the second the \u852c\u85cd *sung lan* or cabbage *lan*, the third the \u85e5\u85cd *liao lan* or *Polygonum lan* [comp. above 366].\n\nThe *mu lan*, said in P. to be cultivated in the southern provinces, is, it seems, *Indigofera*. The Phon zo, XIX, 17, figures under \u6728\u85cd or \u85cd\u67d3 *Indigofera tinctoria*. Li Sui-chen describes the *ma lan* as a leguminous plant with leaves resembling those of the *Sophora*; pale red flowers, succeeded by pods one inch and more long.\n\nThe *sung lan* or cabbage *lan* is *Isatis*. It has the same Chinese name in Japan. So moku, XII, 45, \u85cd\u67d3 or \u6c5f\u5357\u5927\u9752 (the great blue of the Chinese province Kiangnan) is, according to Franchet, *Isatis japonica*, Miq.\nThe *liau lan* of ancient authors is *Polygonum tinctorium*, Lour. It is figured under *lan* in Ch., XI, 12, recto. So moku, VII, 77, and Phon zo, XIX, 16, \u85cd *Polygonum tinctorium*, japonice ai.\n\nWe read in Thunberg's *Flora japonica* [166] *Polygonum chinense*, L., japonice ai, and *itadori*. Planta est eernuleo-tinctoria instar Indigo . . . . P. barbatum et ariculare eundem in finem:\u2014and in Siebold's *Syn. plant. acou. jap.* [106] *Polygonum rhinense*, \u85cd japonice ai. Herba tinctoria maxime in Japonia usitata. Neither Thunberg nor Siebold mentions *P. tinctorium*, which, however, as we know from various sources, is much cultivated in Japan for its indigo. I therefore suspect that the *P. chinense* of Thunberg and Siebold may be *P. tinctorium*.\n\nI am not prepared to say what tinctorial plant with serrate leaves is figured under *lan* in Ch., XI, 12, verso.\n\nI have no doubt that the *lan* of the Classics was *Polygonum tinctorium*, which nowadays seems to be the most important of the Chinese Indigo plants. The *Hia Calendar* by *liau lan* doubtless means this plant. *Indigofera* is out of the question, for it is a tropical or subtropical plant, not indigenous to China. P., XVI, 76, quotes an author of the 10th century who states that the \u9752\u9edb, ts'ing tai, which is the true Indigo, was introduced into China from Persia.\n\nE., 105 [v. supra, 178]. S., I, 34.\n\nJap., 1170, *Isatis japonica*, Miq., \u85e5\u85cd.\n\n393.\u2014\u8594\u8587 *ju la* is the name of a plant mentioned in the *Shi king*. Legge translates correctly madder plant.\n\n*Shi king*, 142:\u2014Near the level ground at the east gate is the madder plant on the bank. 146:\u2014Madder-dyed coiffure. 382:\u2014Character \u7d05 mei, which means madder-dyed. According to the *Shuo wen* this is also a name for the madder plant. In the *Shi king*, by this term madder-dyed knee-covers are meant,\nThe *ju l\u00fc* is noticed in the *Rh ya* [22], where also other names are given.\n\n**Lu ki:**\u2014The *ju l\u00fc* [other names quoted from the *Rh ya*] is also called \u5730\u8840 ti h\u0101e (earth's blood). The people in \u5317\u65b9 Ts'\u012b (Northern Shantung) call it \u831c\u8349 ts'ien, in \u5f90\u5dde S\u016b eh\u014du (Northern Kiangsu) it is \u725b\u8513 nin m\u0101ng (ox creeper). Now the people cultivate it in gardens.\n\nThe plant ts'ien, with which the ancient commentators identify the *ju l\u00fc* of the *Shi kung*, is the *Rubia cordifolia*, L., a common plant in the northern and central provinces of China. The root is used as a red dye in China and Japan like the root of our madder plant, *R. tinctorum*, L.\n\nP., XVIIIb, 19, ts'ien.

Adhibetur Rubiae nostratis adinstar tinctoria. But *Queria trichotoma* of Thbg., is, according to Maximowicz, *Wickstromia japonica*, Miq. I suspect Siebold was mistaken, all the more as the *So moku* II, 64, and the *Phon zo*, XXIX, 18, both figure under \u831c\u8349, japonicae akane, *Rubia cordifolia*.\n\nV. supra, 22.

The same as *ju l\u00fc* or *Rubia* already spoken of.\n2.\u2014The \u6851\u845a t'o lu (Biot reads ki lin). K.D. writes \u7d22\u845a so lu. These names are not found in P.\n\n3.\u2014The \u732a\u9996 shi shou (pig's head). This is mentioned in the Rh ya [35] where perhaps Carpesium abrotanoides is intended. But that is not a tinctorial plant.\n\n4.\u2014\u7d2b\u834a tsz' lie. [Comp. the Rh ya, 142].

These are cupules of the acorns of oaks [c. infra, 534].\n\nVI.\u2014Water Plants.\n\n395.\u2014The beautiful Lotus plant, the Nelumbium speciosum, Willd., is spoken of in the Shi king. Compare regarding its ancient names and names for various parts of the plant, the Rh ya, 99, 100, 191.\n\nShi king, 137:\u2014In the marshes is the Lotus flower \u8377\u83ef ho hua. 213:\u2014By the shores of that marsh there are rushes and Lotus flowers (ho). In the same ode, farther on, we have Lotus flowers \u83d6\u84b2 han tan [Legge explains unopened flowers of the Lotus].\n\nLu ki gives the following account of the plant [for the Chinese characters see above, 99, 100, Rh ya]:\u2014\n\nThe ho is also called fu ku. The former name is usual in Kiangtung. Its stem is called kia, the leaves hia, the part of the plant below the leaves is \u767d\u84bb pai jo, the unopened flower han tan, the expanded flower fu ku. Its fruit is lien. The green skin of the seed receptacle is \u88cf li. The white\nseed is ti. In the centre of the seed there is a small green hook (the plumule) which is called i and is very bitter, whence the proverb \"bitter as a plumule of the Lotus-seed.\" In the fifth month the seeds begin to form. The unripe tender seeds are eaten. In autumn the lien or receptacle is getting black, and then the ripe seeds are ground into meal, which is used for food like millet. It is nourishing, strengthens the body. It is also eaten boiled into gruel. It is especially useful to the people of \u907c\u5dde Yu chou (Northern Chili), \u6e56\u5dde Yang chon (Auhui, Chekiang), and \u8c6b\u5dde Y\u00fc chou (Honan), in time of dearth. The root stock is called ou. In Y\u00fc chou the people call it \u5149\u65c1 kuang p'uang; it is shining like an ox-horn.\n\nLi sao, 19:\u2014J'ai s\u00e9ch\u00e9 des feuilles du n\u00e9nuphar (\u8377) pour orner mes v\u00eatements sup\u00e9rieurs, j'ai amass\u00e9 des fleurs d'Althaea (\u8299\u84c9) pour orner mes v\u00eatements inf\u00e9rieurs. I may observe that fu yung in ancient times was not Althaea but another name for the Lotus flower [v. supra, 99, 101].\n\nNelumbium speciosum is extensively cultivated throughout the Chinese Empire. At Peking the people eat the fresh seeds and cook the arrowroot obtained from the root stock into a jelly which is considered very wholesome.\n\nOf the ancient terms applied to the plant and parts of it, only three are still in use. The flowers are called \u84ee\u82b1 lien hua, the leaves \u8377\u8449 ho ye, the root stock is \u85e4\u6839 ou fen.\n\nP. XXXIII, 16, lien ou. The plant is figured under the same name in Ch.

Its farinaceous seeds are used as food by the natives. The whole plant is covered with prickles; large leaves with prominent spiny veins. The popular Chinese name of the plant is \u9e21\u5934 *ki t'ou* (cock's head). This name is very fitting; the long, thin, persistent, closely cohering segments of the calyx enclosing the ovary, indeed resemble a cock's head. The classical name of the plant is \u8377 *k'ien*. It appears only once in the *Chou li* [I, 108]:\u2014Offerings. Les paniers suppl\u00e9mentaires sont remplis avec des ch\u00e2taignes d'eau, des fruits de la plante *k'ien*, etc. Cheng Sz-nung comments *ki t'ou* (cock's head).\n\nThe *k'ien* is not mentioned in the *Rh ya*, but is noticed in the *Fang yen* [1st century B.C.] The common Chinese names are given there as *k'ien* and *ki t'ou*. In \u5317\u71d5 Pei yen (Northern Chili) it is also called \u8377 or \u84c9. These characters are not found in *K.D.*, but are probably the same as \u84c9 *wei* or *yi* given in the *Kuang ya* as a synonym for *k'ien*.\n\nP., XXXIII, 27, *k'ien*.

At Peking the common name for the water-caltrop is now \u84ee\u89d2 (*ling kae*), the second character meaning horn, in allusion to the horns at the top of the fruit.\n\nP., XXXIII, 26, \u83b2\u5be6 (*k'i shi* (*k'i* fruit) also *ling, ling kue*.\n\n*S\u00fc Sung* [11th century] distinguishes two kinds of *ling*, with two and with four horns. *Li Shih-ch'en* gives a good description of the plant.\n\nDrawings in the *Kiu huang* [LVIII, 10] under *ling kue* (plant recognizable), and in *Ch.*, XXXII, 19, good figure.\n\nThe water-caltrop cultivated at Peking is the *Trapa hispina*osa, Roxb., which is found also in Kashmir. *Loureiro* [*Flora cochin.*, 85] mentions the *Trapa chinensis* cultivated at Canton. *Linnaeus* described a water-caltrop received from Canton as *T. bicornis*. *Henry* [*l.c.*, 243, 244]:\u2014In\nIchang ling kuei is *Tr. bispinosa*.

Cheng Szu-nung thinks that \u85dc *mao* [r. infra, 459] is to be understood, the young sprouts of which are eaten. But the other commentators do not assent to this interpretation and identify the plant in question with *fu k'ui*. The *mao* was one of the seven vegetable pickles [r. supra, 376, note].\n\nThe *mao* is also mentioned in the *Shan hai king*. Kuo Po identifies it with *fu k'ui*.\n\nLu ki:\u2014The *mao* resembles the *king ts'ai* [see the next]. The leaves are round like a hand, of a red colour, succulent and slimy, they slip between the fingers. The stalks are long. The plant can be eaten raw or cooked. The people of Kiangnan call it \u85a4\u83dc *shun ts'ai* (shun vegetable) also \u6c34\u8475 *shui k'ui* (water-mallow).

Pl. Jap., I, 25], the plant figured in the Phon zo [XXIV, 10] under \u83d6 or djoun se is not Villarsia peltata (= Limnanthemum peltatum, Griseb., order Gentianaceae), but Brasenia peltata, Pursh., a water-plant, order Nymphoraceae, found also in North America and India. [See Botan. Mag., tab. 1147.] It was first called Hydropeltis purpurea. The whole plant is coated with a gelatinous substance. It is the Menyanthes nymphoides of Thunberg [Flora jap., 82]. In the Amoen. erot. [82] the above Chinese and Japanese names are erroneously referred to a Sagittaria.\n\nThis plant has not yet been met with in China by European botanists, but the drawing in Ch. may well represent Brasenia, and the above early description of it by Lu ki agrees.\n\nE., 65, family \u83d6.

Its flower is yellow. It is very like the shan [see the preceding] which Medhurst calls the marsh mallow, but its leaves are not so round, being a little pointed.\n\nThis plant is mentioned in the Rh ya [47] hing or tsie yu.\n\nLu ki:\u2014The hing or tsie yu has a white stalk. The leaves are of a purplish red colour, they are orbicular (peltate), more than an inch in diameter. They float on the surface of the water; the root is at the bottom, short or long according to the depth of the water. The upper part is green, the inferior part white. The people eat the white stalks. They are also steeped in bitter wine.\n\nAt Peking hang ts'ai is Limnanthemum nymphoides, Link., an aquatic Gentianacea with sub-orbicular floating leaves and yellow flowers.\n\nP.

Legge says it belongs to the same species of aquatic plants as the hang ts'ai. The Pen ts'ao says:\u2014There are three varieties of it, the large called p'in the small \u6d6e\u840d fou ping and the middle hang ts'ai. Mao makes the p'in the large variety, while Chu Hi and some others make it the third. The p'in may be eaten, says Yen Tsan, but not the fou ping. P'in is probably Lemna trisulca [Legge].\n\nShi king, 25 [Ode devoted to the p'in]:\u2014She gathers the large duck-weed (p'in). See the Rh ya, 113, 114, \u6d6e or \u6f02 ping the smaller, p'in the larger kind.\nLu ki:\u2014The p'ing belongs to the plants on the surface of the water which we call fou p'ing, floating p'ing. The smaller kind is called \u7fe1\u7fe0 p'ing. In the middle of spring it begins to grow. It is eaten cooked with soup. It is also steeped in bitter wine.\n\nP.

Ch., XVIII, 6, depicts, under p'ing, a water-plant with leaves disposed in a cross, evidently a Marsilea, probably M. quadriflora, L.\n\nThe Phon zo [XXXIV, 3] represents under \u85fb, also \u6c34\u9f9c (water-turtle), Hydrocharis morsus ranae, L., a small floating aquatic plant with stalked, kidney-shaped leaves and flowers with three delicate petals. The same Japanese work figures [l. c.] under the Chinese name \u7530\u5b57\u8349, Marsilea quadriflora. It seems that the Chinese also confound these two plants under the same names, for some of the ancient authors quoted in P. say that the p'ing has white flowers. This does not agree with Marsilea, which is an aquatic pseudofern, and has no flowers. Besides this, Ch. XVII, 36, figures under \u99ac\u5c3f\u82b1 ma niao hua or \u8349 fou ts'ai [v. supra, P., synonym of p'ing] Hydrocharis morsus ranae.\n\nAs to the \u7fe1\u7fe0 or \u7fe1\u7fe0 p'ing, which the Rh ya calls the smaller kind, this is mentioned in the Ritual Classics. Legge translates correctly duck-weed.\n\nIn the Chou li [II, 380] we have the \u6d6e\u840d p'ing shi. Pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 aux plantes flottantes. Commentator B.

It grows at the bottom of the water. There are two kinds. One of them has leaves like those of the \u96c0\u5de2 ki su, (a labiate plant). The stem is as thick as a quill, from four to five feet long. The stem of\nthe other kind is as thick as a hair-pin; its leaves resemble those of the \u84ec\u84bf p'eng huo (Chrysanthemum coronarium). This is called \u805a\u85fb ts\u016b tsao (tufty tsao). The people of \u6276\u98a8 Fu feng (in Shansi) say that it emits a sound. Both kinds of tsao are eaten. When cooked they lose their unpleasant smell. They are boiled with flour, and furnish a relishable dish. In Yang chou, in time of dearth, the tsao plant serves as a substitute for corn.\n\nBoth MAO and CHU HI identify the tsao of the Shi king with the ts\u016b tsao.\n\nP., XIX, 26, treats of these plants under the head of \u6c34\u85fb shui tsao, fresh water tsao (for there is also a hai tsao or sea tsao). The ancient authors quoted there call the larger kind \u99ac\u85fb ma tsao [see the Rh ya, 111]. It is said to have opposite leaves resembling those of purslane, two or three inches long. The other kind, the ts\u016b tsao, has fine slender leaves resembling raw silk, others says the gills of a fish, and are arranged in whorls around the stem.\n\nCH., XVIII, 23, represents under tsao, also called \u672d\u85fb cha tsao, a Myriophyllum. At Peking cha tsao is the popular name for M. spicatum, L.\n\nThe above-noticed metaphorical meaning of the character tsao, \"elegant composition,\" is derived, it seems, from the elegant pinnatifid capillary leaves of the Myriophyllum or Water Milfoil.\n\nThe Phon zo [XXXIV, 12] figures under \u99ac\u85fb a pond-weed, Potamogeton crispus, L., and under \u805a\u85fb Myriophyllum spicatum, L.\n\nV. supra, 111.

This latter is mentioned in the Tso chuan, also in the Ts'iu sz\u00fc, or Elegies of Ts'iu [by K'\u00fc Y\u00fcan, 4th century B.C.] K'ung tsz (Confucius) says [probably in the Kia yu, or Family Sayings of C.], the lan is the fragrance (fragrant flower) of the king. The stem and leaf are like those of the medicinal plant tse lan (marsh lan). The joints are wide apart, and the stem between them is red, and it rises to a height of four or five feet. In the time of the Han, this plant was cultivated in the Imperial gardens. It was added to cosmetics, and was used also to preserve clothes and books from insects.\n\nThe lan is mentioned in the Hua Calendar [74, fifth month]:\u2014Tenderly nurtured are the Vanda plants. I agree with Prof. Douglas in this identification of the lan.\n\nLi ki, I, 458:\u2014If anyone give the wife an article of food and dress, a piece of cloth or silk, a handkerchief for her girdle, an Iris [ch'i, v. infra, 411] or Orchid (lan), she should receive it and offer it to her parents-in-law.\n\nTso chuan, 294:\u2014The lan is there called the most fragrant flower of the State. A legend reported regarding this flower and a Duke of one of the feudal states [B.C. 603].\n\nLi sao:\u2014The fragrant lan plant is frequently mentioned by K'\u00fc Y\u00fcan [4, 10, 13, 19, 49, 55, 56, 58]. In 4, he speaks of the ts'iu lan or autumn lan. The name of the lan flower appears frequently in the compositions of the ancient Chinese poets.\n\nThe account given of the lan in the Rh ya i is very obscure. It is said there to be a very fragrant plant which grows in the depths of forests. It resembles the hui [see the next] but differs from the latter in bearing only a single\nflower on each stem, whilst the hui has five or six flowers on the same stem.\n\nI can also make nothing of the descriptions of the lan ts'ao found in P. XIVb, 75. A number of synonyms are given there, and it seems the authors confound several quite different plants. Ibidem, 78, the \u6fa4\u862d tse lan is spoken of.\n\nIn the So moku [XV, 55] \u862d\u8349 is Eupatorium chinense, L., and, Ibidem [57] \u6fa4\u862d is also a Eupatorium. The Chinese drawings in Ch. XXV, 1 and 13, under the above Chinese names, seem also to be intended for Eupatorium, a genus of the order Composite, of which six species are known in China. Although the flowers of Eupatorium exhale an odour which is not unpleasant, I do not believe that the famous perfume lan of the ancient Chinese can be referred to this plant. I agree with Williams that the lan must rather have been an orchidaceous plant, for even nowadays this name is applied to plants of this order, cultivated for the powerful fragrance of their flowers. Comp. Bridgman's Chrest., 452:\u2014Air plant, Alrides and Vanda \u540a\u862d tiao lan (suspended lan), \u98a8\u862d feng lan.

Kuo Po explains that it is a kind of lan, and that some say\nit is the same as \u85b0 h\u016bn. The term hui is met with five times in the Li sao [6, 10, 15, 30, 55]. The Kuang ya identifies the hui and the h\u016bn.\n\nThe Rh ya i says the hui resembles the lan, it grows in the mountain forests, flowers in spring, earlier than the lan, bears from five to six flowers on the same stem. According to the Kuang chi [5th century] this plant has purple flowers. The Emperor Wu ti of the Wei dynasty [5th century] used this fragrant plant for burning.\n\nThe hui was probably also an orchid.

Its leaves resemble the leaves of hemp; square stem, dark red flowers. This plant worn in a girdle expels noxious influences. See also the quotation from the Tso chuan, regarding the charmeter h\u016bn [supra, 85].\n\nIn P., XIVb, 72, this plant is noticed under the names \u85b0\u8349 h\u016bn ts'ao or \u96f6\u9675\u9999 ling ling liang [Ling ling==present Yungchon-fu in Southern Hunan]. Li SHI-CHEN says that this was the fragrant plant the ancients used to burn, to make the spirits descend. No conclusion can be drawn from the vague descriptions of the plant as given by Chinese authors.\n\nCh., XXV, 60, figures under the above names a hibiate plant. The author of that work says that this plant at Peking is known by the name of \u77ee\u9999 ai kang. But the latter is there the common name of Ocimum basilicum, L., Basilic, the leaves of which have a strong but pleasant aromatic smell.\n\nThe Phon zo [XI, 11] figures under \u85b0\u8349 or \u96f6\u9675\u9999 Melilotus arvensis, Wallr., and the So moku [XIV, 16, 17]\nPLANTS MENTIONED IN CLASSICAL WORKS.\n\nThe latter Chinese name is taken from the *Kiu huang* [LVIII, 20] where a rude figure of a trifoliate plant is given.\n\n408.\u2014*Y\u00fc* was the name of a fragrant plant which was mixed with the sacrificial wine called *ch'ang* [r. supra, 349].\n\n*Chou li*, I, 465:\u2014Officier des plantes aromatiques *yo* (*y\u00fc*).

But it may also be translated the plant *y\u00fc kiu huang*. *Y\u00fc kiu* and *y\u00fc kiu huang* are two different plants.\n\n*Li ki*, II, 141:\u2014The mortar for the fragrant herbs (*y\u00fc*) in making sacrificial spirits (*ch'ang*) was made of cypress wood [see the *Rh ya*, 225] and the pestle of *Dryandra* [which is *Sterculia*, i.e., 283, 516].

[l.c., 67] an obscure account is given of the plant called y\u016b kin hiang. It is there said to be a foreign plant of Western Asia or India with fragrant flowers. The Buddhist priest Huen Tsinang mentions it in the mountains of Hindukush and in Kashmir [Beal's Si yu ki, I, 54, 120, 148; II, 125].\n\nThe two plants y\u016b kin and y\u016b kin hiang are sometimes confounded by Chinese authors. Y\u016b kin hiang is not Curcuma, as Dr. Eitel, in his Handbook of Chinese Buddhism, states, but an entirely different plant. Williams [Dict., 1139] thinks that this name denotes the Sumbul root. The drawing of the plant in Ch., XXV, 38, seems to be a product of imagination. The Phon zo figures [XI, 5, 6, 7] under \u9ec3\u91d1\u9999, several plants, an Iris and Tulipes, it seems.\n\nThe Chinese commentators seem to agree that the plant y\u016b of the Classics was the y\u016b kin, not the y\u016b kin hiang. The Rh ya i quotes a passage from the Shi king [445] where the sacrificial wine is called \u9ec3\u6d41 huang liu (yellow liquid) and explains this name by the yellow colour of the curcuma root.\n\nE., 163, family \u9ec3\u91d1, figure may be of Curcuma. The figure to P., XIVb, differs widely.\n\nJap., 719 [v. supra, 379].\n\n409.\u2014The character \u82b8 y\u016bn occurs in the Classics with different meanings. In the Shi king [384, 423] we have \u82b8\u5176\u9ec3, which Legge translates, according to Mao's and Chu's interpretations, by (flowers) of a deep yellow. In the Conf. Anal. [199] y\u016bn stands for \u8018 (to weed). In Mencius it has the same meaning. But the principal meaning of the character y\u016bn seems to refer to a fragrant plant, and in this sense we find it in the Hia Calendar and in the Li ki. Douglas translates y\u016bn, on the authority of Williams, by rue, Legge by rice.\nPlants Mentioned in Classical Works.\n\nHia Calendar. 16:\u2014First month is picked the rue. 35:\u2014Second month, beautiful is the rue.\n\nLi ki, I, 304 [Yue ling]:\u2014Second month of winter. Rice (y\u00fcn) begins to grow. The Chinese commentator explains y\u00fcn in this passage by fragrant plant. I cannot understand why Legge makes it to be rice.\n\nThe Rh ya i says regarding the y\u00fcn:\u2014It is a kind of pea (wan tou); its leaves are very fragrant. In autumn they are mealy white. The people in the south put the y\u00fcn plant under their mats and in books to drive away insects. Now it is called \u4e03\u91cc\u9999 ts'ii li hsiang (seven li fragrance).\n\n[Comp. also the Rh ya, 146.]\n\n410.\u2014\u82b7 Chi. A fragrant plant growing in deep valleys, mentioned in the Li sao [4, 10, 55]. The Chinese in ancient times used to wear this, together with other odoriferous plants, in their girdles. The name of a plant \u85ac yo occurs several times in the Shan hai king. Kuo P'o says it is the \u767d\u82b7 pai chi; the Kuang ya says the leaves of the pai chi. In W.D. [1116] this character (yo) is given as an equivalent for \u85e5 (medicinal herb).\n\nAccording to P. [XIVa, 11] chi is the same as the plant now called \u767d\u82b7 pai chi (white chi), mentioned as a fragrant medicinal plant in the Pen ts'ao king. It is also called \u82b3\u9999 jiang hsiang. The very white aromatic root is used as a medicine.\n\nCh. [XXV, 8] figures under pai chi a large umbelliferous plant. Parker [China Rev., X, 299] states that the pai chi is widely cultivated in Sz'ch'uan. Porter Smith [Chinese Materia Medica, 120] identifies it erroneously with Iris florentina, as also does Williams.\n\nSiebold, Syn. plant. acou. jap., 253:\u2014\u767d\u82b7 or bidjakusi. Selinea?

This is likewise a fragrant plant mentioned in the *Li sao* [6, 13, 15] as worn in a girdle together with other perfumes. In the *Li ki* [I, 458] this plant is noticed together with the *lan*. *Legge* identifies it erroneously with *Iris*. [See the quotation, supra in 405.]\n\nThe *Shuo wen* says:\u2014The *chi* has several names. In \u9f4a Tsi (Northern Shantung) it is called *chi*, in \u6649 Tsin (Southern Shansi) it is \u8594 *hiao*, in \u695a Ch'iu (Hukwang) it is called \u8594 *li*. The name *hiao* occurs also in the *Shan hai king*. Kuo Po explains it by fragrant herb.\n\n*P.* makes the *chi* to be the same as the *pai chi* [see the preceding], and identifies it also with the plant mentioned in the *Rh ya* [98], but that seems to be a mistake.\n\n412.\u2014\u6c5f\u8594 *Kiang li*, a plant mentioned in the *Li sao* [4, 58]. *Li des rivi\u00e8res*, plante aromatique. In *W.D.* [517] *kiang li* is translated by water-grass, sedge, referring probably to the *Rh ya* [98]. But the *Shuo wen*, and the ancient commentators on that Dictionary, identify it with the plant noticed in the *Rh ya* [89] *mi* (*mei*) *wu*.\n\n*P.*, XIVa, 5, 9. The ancient authors quoted there state that \u8568 *mi* *wu* or *kiang li* are names applied to the fragrant young leaves of the plant called \u9752\u862d *kung k'uang* or \u5ddd\u828e *ch'uan kung*, the root of which is used in medicine.\nThe best comes from Shu or Szechuan. Judging from the description of the Chinese authors, this is an aromatic umbelliferous plant, probably an Angelica. See the drawings in the Kin huang [XLVI, 31] and Ch. [XXV, 4]; umbelliferous plant.\n\nThere is a passage in the Tso chuan [315, 321] referring to the year B.C. 595:\u2014Have you any spirits made from the hill-grass? The Chinese text has only \u5c71\u97a0\u85ac.

It is said to resemble the kung k'iuung [412], and we may therefore suppose that it is an umbelliferous plant.

The ancient authors describe it as a small plant, resembling the \u7d30\u8f9b si sin. It has roundish leaves resembling in shape a horse's hoof, violet flowers. Fruit of the size of a pea (bean). It contains small seeds. The fragrant root is used in medicine. The Taoists employ it for scenting clothes. The si sin is described P., XIII, 51. The drawings of the tu heng and the si sin [Ch., VIII, 27, and VII, 25] both represent species of Asarum. Loureiro, Flora coeh., 357, Asarum virginicum; sinice si sin.

Name of a plant mentioned in the Li sao [13]. Je fais des guirlandes avec les fleurs tomb\u00e9es du pi li. The Rh ya i says that this is the same as \u859c\u8354 pi li in the Shan hai king, a plant which climbs on rocks and trees. When eaten it removes pain in the heart. Kuo P'o says it is a fragrant plant.\n\nThe name pi li in China as well as in Japan is applied to one or several creeping species of Ficus. See P., XVIIIb, 40, \u6728\u84ee mu lien, which is another name for the plant; Ch., XX, 3, the plant figured is probably F. pumila, L.\n\nThe Chinese name \u859c\u8354 in Japan is given to F. pumila, according to Hoffm. & Schultes; to F. erecta, Thbg., in\nSIEB., Syn. plant. avon., 173; to F. nipponica, Franchet, in\nSIEB. icon. jap. ined., VII.\n\nBut the name pi li in the Li sao does not seem to refer to a\nFicus, for the minute flowers of a fig are enclosed in the\nfleshy receptacle, and cannot therefore drop off as the text\nof the Li sao implies.\n\nW.D. [675] says that pi li is an herb resembling celery or\nsmallage, and that it is also one of the names for Ficus pumila\nin Formosa.\n\nE., 142, family \u85af\u8553, with figure probably of Ficus pumila.\nJap., 947, Ficus nipponica, Fr. & S., has this Chinese name.\n,, 944, Ficus carica, L., \u7121\u82b1\u679c, also in China.\n,, 945, Ficus erecta, Thbg., \u5929\u4ed9\u679c.\n,, 951, Ficus stipulata, Thbg., \u6728\u8513\u982d.\n,, 952, Ficus Wightiana, Wall., \u6995\u6a39.\n\n416.\u2014In the French translation of the Li sao [p. 47] we\nread:\u2014J'ai cueilli l'herbe magique pour faire un sortil\u00e8ge\navec les tiges de la plante ya\u00ef.\n\nThe magic herb in the Chinese text is \u8594\u8588 kiung mao;\nthe commentary says a fragrant herb.

The text has \u9752\u7b4d ping tsuan, and the\ncommentary explains, as I understand it, that ping means a\nsmall bamboo splinter, and tsuan in the country of Ch'iu has\nthe meaning to divine by means of knotting herbs (or the\nknotted herb) and bamboo splinters.

The commentaries only say that both these names refer to fragrant plants. Regarding the kie che see the Rh ya [145]. See also K.K.F.P., XCH, 7. The Kungchei [5th century] says that the kie che has a pungent taste. It is several feet high, has white flowers. The Hui yao Pents'ao [8th century] states that it is found in the mountains of the island Hainan. It is offensive to moths and other insects.

Legge says, regarding this plant, mentioned in the Shi king, that it is a lily called the \"mother-of-pearl\" from the appearance of its shining bulbous roots, or, as others say, from that of its flower. It is the Fritillaria Thumbergii. Many medical qualities are ascribed to the root, among them that of dissipating melancholy.\n\nShi king, 88:\u2014I will ascend that mound with the steep side, and gather the mother-of-pearl lilies.\nSee the *Rh ya* [75], where the name is written \u8c9d\u6bcd meng and identified with \u8c9d\u6bcd pei mu, which latter term Legge translates by mother-of-pearl, but Williams [Dict., 609] more correctly by cowrie-mother [see further on].\n\n**Lu ki:**\u2014The meng or pei mu is a medicinal plant. Its leaves resemble those of the kua lou (*Trichosanthes*), but are smaller. The seeds are produced beneath the root and resemble those of the \u828b yu (*Colocasia*). They are white, quadrangular shaped, of various sizes, and connected together. The Chinese author, in this confused account, seems to confound the seeds with the small bulbils forming the corm of the plant.\n\nFather David saw the Chinese plant, whose bulbs furnish the drug pei mu, at Moupin, on the borders of Tibet. According to Franchet [*Pl. Davidiana*, II, 130] this is *Fritillaria Roylii*, Hook, with yellow flowers. Another, new species, *F. Davidii*, likewise found at Moupin, is described as having corms formed of a number of small bulbils. It is, I suppose, the same with respect to the corms of the other species. Fortune in his *Wanderings* [261] notices a *Fritillaria* with greyish white flowers, cultivated for its bulbs, near Ningpo. This is probably the pei mu exported from Ningpo, mentioned in the *Reports on Trade, Chinese Maritime Customs*, for 1869, p. 66, where some interesting details regarding this drug are given.\n\nIn the *So moku* [V, 81] \u8c9d\u6bcd is *Fritillaria Thunbergii*, Miq. But neither the account of the pei mu as given in *P.*, XIII, 39, nor the drawing in *Ch.*, VII, 42 (a plant with hastate leaves) agrees with *Fritillaria*. Lu ki, as we have seen, makes the pei mu to have palmate leaves. The leaves of *Fritillaria* are generally linear lanceolate, in some species broader, elliptical. The Chinese drug pei mu (bulbils) resembles indeed, as the Chinese name implies, the small\nshells used for coin in many parts of Southern Asia and Africa under the name of cowry (Cypraea moneta).\n\nHenry [l.c., 366] states that the plant which occurs on the mountains of the Patung district, and the bulbs of which are sold as a drug, is a new species of Pleione (an orchid). He thinks that the pei mu of Szechuan is not from the same plant.\n\nV. supra, 75. Jap., 974, Fritill. Thunbergii, Miq., \u8c9d\u6bcd.\nC., 993, Frit. Roylei, Hk.\nB., Uvularia cirrhosa, Thbg.

They are common in the Peking mountains, and are more generally known by the name \u9ec3\u82b1 huang hua or yellow flower. H. fulva is also much cultivated at Peking as well as in other parts of China. Its dried flowers are largely consumed as food by the Chinese and go also under the name \u91d1\u91dd\u83dc kin chen ts'ai (gold needle vegetable). These are the Lily flowers of the Chinese Maritime Customs Reports. [See also Loureiro, Flora cochin, 254.]\nThe *huan ts'ao* is described in *P., XVI*, 19.

Drawings of the *tsi li* or *Tribulus* are found in the *Kiu huaag*, LII, 3, and *Ch.*, XI, 27.\n\n*Phon zo*, XX, 16, \u75be \u6851, *Tribulus terrestris*.\n\nV. supra, 90. Jap., 2221.\n\n428.\u2014\u8457 *Shi*. This is the divining plant, the stalks of which were used in ancient times for the purpose of divination. It is once mentioned in the *Shi king* [225]:\u2014Cold come the waters down from that spring and overflow the bushy divining plant.\n\nCHU HI explains *shi* by \u7b46 \u8349 (divining plant).\n\n*Chou li*, II, 80:\u2014L'officier de la plante divinatoire (\u7b46 \u5165 *shi jen*) s'occupe des trois m\u00e9thodes des changements, et distingue les noms des neuf devins par la plante *chi* (*shi*). Les neuf devins servent pour distinguer le bonheur et le malheur. Dans toutes les grandes affaires d'\u00e9tat, d'abord on fait la divination par la plante *chi*; ensuite on angure par la tortue. Au commencement du printemps le m\u00eame officier fait l'inspection des plantes divinatoires.\n\n*Li ki*, I, 94:\u2014On the subject of Divination. Divination by the tortoise-shell (\u9f9c *kui*) is called \u9f9c *pu*; divination by the stalks (\u7b46 *ts'e*) is called \u7b14 *shi*. The two were the methods by which the ancient wise kings made the people\nbelieve in seasons and days, revere spiritual beings, stand in awe of their laws and orders; the method also by which they made them determine their perplexities and settle their misgivings. The commentator \u5415\u6c0f says that \u7b56 stands here for \u8457 shi.\n\nIbidem I, 298 [Yueh hing]:\u2014First month of winter. Orders are given to the Grand Recorder to smear with blood the tortoise-shell and the divining stalks (\u7b56 explained as above) and by interpreting the indications of the former and examining the figures formed by the latter, to determine the good and evil of their intimations. 1, 385:\u2014The ancient kings made use of the stalks [as above] and the tortoise-shell.\n\nShu king, 335:\u2014Divination. In all the indications are seven, five given by the tortoise, two by the milfoil (shi).\n\nBiot says [in an article on the Manners of the Ancient Chinese, translated by Legge in his Shi king, Proleg. 142-171]:\u2014We do not know well how this divination was performed formerly. At the present day they place on the right and on the left a packet of leaves of this plant (shi); then they recite some mysterious words, and by taking a handful of leaves from each packet, they prognosticate according to their number. Legge observes that stalks, and not leaves, have always been mentioned to him by Chinese describing the method of divination.\n\nIn the Shi ki, or Historical Record, in the article on divination, it is said that a hundred stalks of the shi plant come out from the same root. Where this plant grows neither tigers, wolves nor poisonous plants are found.\n\nThe Shuo wen says:\u2014The shi is a kind of hao (Artemisia). The plant will yield, when a thousand years old, three hundred stalks. The lengths of the stalks used in the manipulation were: for the Son of Heaven 9 feet, for the feudal princes 7, for the high officers 5, and for the graduates 3 feet.\nChu Hi says:\u2014The way of divination by the tortoise was by the application of fire, to search the shell till the indications appeared on it; and that by the stalks of the shi plant was to manipulate in the prescribed way 49 of them, 18 different times, till the diagram was formed. Legge calls this divination sometimes \"divination by reeds.\" [Shu king, 98, 266.]\n\nLegge [Shu king, 335] calls the shi plant milfoil. Williams [Dict., 758] says it is a sort of syngenesious plant resembling the Anthemis, the Ptarmica sibirica, which grows around Confucius' grave in K\u00fch fen, and, as was done in ancient times, is still sold there in parcels of 64 stalks, for divination. The stems were once used for hair-pins.\n\nFrom the account given of the shi plant in P., XV, 7, we may conclude that it belongs to the order of Compositae. The drawing of it in Ch., XI, 5, is very rude, and no identification can be ventured.\n\nIn the So moku, XVII, 44, \u83ca is the Achillea sibirica, Ledeb. This is a common plant in the mountains of Northern China. But whether it really was the divining plant of the ancient Chinese, I am not prepared to say. At Peking the name shi is unknown.\n\nF., too, family \u83ca. Figure the same as P., XV, 7, which can neither be Achillea nor any other composita, but may be meant for a Hypericum?\n\nS., 1, 32, has two figures which may both represent Hyperica, one large flowered, the other small flowered.\n\nJap., 39, Achillea sibirica, Ledeb.\n\n429.\u2014The genus Artemisia is represented in China by a considerable number of species. Forbes and Hemsley, in the Index Flora sinensis, enumerate 21. In the Shu king we meet with eight names of plants referred by Legge and others to Southernwood or Artemisia.\nThe \u827e ai, which name occurs in the Shih king [120] has been correctly identified by Legge with the Mugwort, Artemisia vulgaris, L. It is one of the plants which the Chinese employ for their moxa.\n\nMencius, 177:\u2014The case of one of the present princes wishing to become emperor, is like the having to seek mugwort (ai) three years old to cure a seven years' sickness. If it have not been kept in store, the patient may all his life not get it. Commentary:\u2014The down of the mugwort burnt on the skin, is used for purposes of cautery. The older the plant, the better.\n\nThe ai is mentioned in the Rh ya [75].\n\nLi sao, 49:\u2014Sachets remplis d'armoise (f\u00e9tide), ai, 55:\u2014Malaises herbes. The Chinese text has siao [c. infra, 435] and ai.\n\nP., XV, 8, ai. Other names:\u2014\u91ab\u8349 / ts'ao (medicinal herb), \u708e\u8349 chi ts'ao, burning herb, moea.

Legge calls it southernwood, a species of Artemisia.\n\nShi king, 17:\u2014Many are the bundles of firewood. I would cut down the southernwood (lou) to form more.\n\nComp. the Rh ya [192]. Shuo wen:\u2014The lou is a plant which is cooked with fish.\n\nLu ki:\u2014The lou is also called \u845b lou hao (lou Artemisia). Its leaves resemble those of the ai (.Artemisia vulgaris), are several inches long, of a white colour (downy). The plant grows to the height of more than 10 feet, by the edges of water or in marshy ground. In the first month the young white shoots, which are soft and fragrant, may be eaten raw. The leaves are eaten cooked.\n\nCh., XII, 6, figures under the name lou hao an Artemisia with large, deeply cleft leaves, resembling the plant in the So moku, XVI, 17, under the same Chinese name, which is a variety of A. vulgaris.\n\nP., XV, 20, considers the lou to be the same as the \u845b\u767d pai hao or white Artemisia.\n\nThe text of the Shi king seems to imply that the lou was used for fuel. I may observe that among the Northern Chinese species of Artemisia, A. campestris answers best this purpose, for it is a shrub attaining considerable dimensions. It is very common in the Peking mountains and in Mongolia. The Mongols call it sharaldji and, according to Przewalsky, employ it largely for fuel.\n\n431.\u2014Hao. Legge says it is the male southernwood, but this term the Chinese authors apply to the next.\n\nShi king, 246:\u2014With pleased sounds the deer call to one another, eating the southernwood (hao) of the fields.\n\n350:\u2014Large and long grow the ngo [v. 431]. It is not the ngo but the hao.\nLi ki, I, 237:\u2014First month of spring. If the governmental proceedings proper to autumn were carried out in spring, there would be pestilence, boisterous winds, rain in torrents; orach (\u85dc) fescue (\u83a0) darnel (\u84ec) and southernwood (\u84bf) would grow up together.\n\nRh ya, 13, hao or shen. Kou P'o explains the names by \u9752\u84bf ts'ing hao.\n\nLu ki:\u2014Huo or ts'ing hao. It is fragrant and fit for being used as moxa. In \u8346\u5dde King chou and \u6e56\u5357 Y\u00fc chou (Hukwang and Honan) the people call it \u718a shen (kien). This latter character is explained in the Shuo wen by \u9999\u84bf hiang hao (fragrant Artemisia).\n\nP., XV, 16, \u9752\u84bf ts'ing hao also \u9999\u84bf hiang hao, and other names. From the descriptions given there it would seem that this is the Artemisia annua, L., a very common species throughout China, and very fragrant. Popular name at Peking hiang huo.\n\nBut in Ch., XI, 92, the figure under \u9ec4\u82b1\u84bf huang hua huo (yellow flower Artemisia) seems to refer to A. annua, which identification would agree with the So moku [XVI, 27]. In the same Japanese work [25] \u9752\u84bf is A. apiacea, Hce., which agrees with the figure under the same Chinese name Ch., XI, 93.\n\nAmano, e.c.t., 897, \u85ff ko, vulgo jamogi Artemisia folio tennissimo. Thunberg [Flora jap., 310] thinks that K\u00e4mpfer refers to A. japonica.\n\n432.\u2014Wei. Legge says a species of southernwood.\n\nShi king, 351:\u2014Long and large grows the ngo [v. 434]. But it is not the ngo but the wei.\n\nRh ya, 14, wei or mou shen (kien).\n\nLu ki:\u2014The wei is also called \u7261\u84bf mou hao (male southernwood). It begins to grow in the third month; in the seventh month it is in flower. The flowers resemble\nthose of the \u80e1\u9ebb hu ma (Sesamum orientale), are of a reddish purple colour. In the eighth month the plant produces long pods pointed at the end like horns. It is also called \u99ac\u65b0\u842c ma sin hao.\n\nUnder the name \u99ac\u5148\u84bf ina sien hao with the above synonyms, wei, mou hao, Ch. [XI, 41] figures the Incarvillea sinensis, Juss., a beautiful plant of Northern China, order Bignoniaceae, with large, scarlet flowers. Lu ki's description agrees with this identification. The same plant is represented in the Kiu huang [XLVI, 33] under the names of \u732a\u7259\u83dc chu ya ts'ai (pig's tooth vegetable) or kue hao (horned Artemisia). These names refer to the long, curved capsules.\n\nBut other authors take the wei or mou hao (male southernwood) to be an Artemisia, and Ch. [XIV, 9] figures under these names an Artemisia. The drawing agrees with that found in the So moku [XVI, 20] under \u7261\u84bf, which represents A. japonica, THUNBERG. [See also P. XV, 23.]\n\nJap., 1581, Pedicularis resupinata, L., \u99ac\u5148\u84bf.\n\n433.\u2014\u8449 Fan. This is likewise an Artemisia. Mao explains the character by \u767d\u84bf pai hao (white Artemisia).\n\nShi king, 22:\u2014She gathers the white southernwood (fan). 228 [\"Life in Pin\"]:\u2014The young women take their deep baskets and go along the small paths, looking for the tender leaves of the mulberry tree; as the spring days lengthen out, they gather in crowds the white southernwood (fan). 264:\u2014Our wives go in crowds to gather the white southernwood (fan).\n\nCHOU HI says that the leaves of the fan were used both in sacrifices and to feed the young silkworms which were later in being hatched. More correctly SU KUANG-KI says that the eggs are washed with a decoction from the leaves to assist their hatching [LEGGE].\nSee the Rh ya [12], fan or p'o hao, Hia Calendar, 30:\u2014Second month. The fan plant is gathered. I do not know on what authority Douglas translates fan by Ailantus glandulosa.\n\nLu ki:\u2014The fan or p'o hao is a kind of ai [Artemisia vulgaris, see 429] of a white colour (i.e., downy leaves). It is also called \u767d\u84bf pai hao (white Artemisia). It begins to grow in spring and (flowers) till autumn. It is fragrant, can be eaten raw and cooked. Another name for the plant is \u6e38\u80e1 yu hu. The people in \u5317\u6d77 Pei hai (Eastern Shantung) call it \u52b3\u52c3 p'ang pu.\n\nP., XV, 20, pai hao. The name is explained by the downy surface of the leaves. The figure of the plant in Ch. [XI. 7] is of no value. In the Peking mountains the people apply the name pai hao to Artemisia Sieversiana, Ehr. In the So moku [XVI. 26] \u767d\u84bf is Artem. Schmidtiana. Maximowicz says:\u2014Tota argenteo-sericen.\n\n434.\u2014\u7fa9 O (ugo). This name Legge translates by Aster southernwood, because he found in the Japanese plates that the common name of the plant in Japan is \u671d\u9bae\u83ca Chao hien k\u016b or Aster of Corea. He says the white flower with which it is there depicted is very like a Chrysanthemum. I may observe that the plant mentioned in the Amoen. exot. [911] under korei giku, Matricaria coreensis, is, according to Thunberg [Flora jap., 320], Chrysanthemum coronarium, L. But the 6, in China at least, is not Chrysanthemum. This character is not met with in the Japanese botanical works known to me.\n\nShi king, 279:\u2014Luxuriantly grows the aster southernwood (6) in the midst of that large mound. 351:\u2014Long and large grows the ngo.\n\nThe Rh ya [44] has 6 or lo. Mao explains 6 by \u84bf lo hao as also does the Shuo wen. The Kuang ya has lo hao\nor \u85dc\u84bf lin hao. Under the latter name the plant is noticed in P., XV, 22. The other names are given as synonyms. The figure in C.h., XIV, 24, under \u00f3 hao is rude. It cannot be decided what kind of plant is meant.\n\nLu ki says:\u2014The 6 hao or lo hao grows in low, swampy places. Its leaves resemble those of the \u912d\u84bf sie hao, but are smaller. The stem of the plant can be eaten raw or cooked.\n\nThe \u912d\u84bf in the So moku [V, 12] is Seseli libanotis, Koch, an umbelliferous plant, but in the Phon zo [XLVII, 5] it is Cardamine sylvatica, Link., according to Franchet; but the drawing rather seems to refer to Sisymbrium sophioides.\n\n\u912d\u84bf in the Phon zo [XIV, 6] is Pedicularis sceptrum carolinum, L.\n\nV. supra, 44.

[See quotation, supra, 429.]\n\nLu ki.\u2014The siu is now called \u837b\u84bf ti hao, also \u725b\u5c3e\u84bf niu wei hao (ox tail's southernwood). It resembles the pai hao [v. 433], has white (downy) leaves. It can be used for torches. Owing to its fragrance it is employed in sacrifices and burned with the fat of the victims.\n\nP. does not notice this plant. Ch. [XII, 28] figures under niu wei hao or siu two plants which may be Artemisia.\n\nThe character \u837b ti properly denotes a reed or rush [v. infra, 455]. I may observe that the Rh ya [196] writes \u837b ts'iu, which latter name, according to Hoffm. & Schultes [50] in Japan is applied to Antennaria (Gnaphalium) maritima, R. Br.\n\nJap., 1037, Gnaphalium yedoense, Fr. & S., \u837b.\n\n436.\u2014There is finally the character \u98db\u84ec p'eng in the Shi, which Legge refers to Artemisia, on the authority of the Shuo wen, where p'eng is explained by hao. [See also the Rh ya, 15.]\n\nShi king, 36:\u2014Strong and abundant grows the Artemisia (p'eng). 105:\u2014Since my husband went to the east, my head has been like the flying (pappus) of the Artemisia (\u98db\u84ec fei p'eng).\n\nIn the Li ki [I, 257] Legge translates p'eng by darnel; [see the quotation under 431].\n\nP. [XXVI, 54] identifies the \u84ec\u84bf p'eng hao with the \u83ca\u84bf tung hao which is Chrysanthemum coronarium, L. Drawings, Ch., IV, 35, Kiu huang, LVIII, 31, So moku, XVII, 13.\n\nChu Hi in explaining the term fei p'eng in the Shi king says that the p'eng has flowers like the catkins of the willow, which fly about in the wind like hair. But other authors [see the Pi ya, and W.D., 661] say that by fei p'eng, or flying p'eng, the whole plant is meant, which is rooted up by\nthe wind and driven across the wastes. This phenomenon of plants being driven across the desert is frequently seen in Mongolia.\n\nIn the Phon zo, XLI, 20, \u98db\u84ec is Erigeron. In the So moku, XVII, 12, \u84ec is Conyza ambigua, DC., a composite plant. Ibidem, IV, 43, \u5ee3\u84ec is Salsola asparagoides, Miq. The plant represented in Ch., XII, 40, under the same Chinese name kien p'eng seems to be a Salsolacea. Kien means Soda. Another salsolaceous plant is figured in Ch., XII, 42, under the name \u6c99\u84ec sha p'eng (sha = sand) a plant of the desert. It is perhaps Atriphyllum.\n\nTwo passages in the Li ki refer to arrows made of the p'eng. Legge translates wild Rubus or Raspberry.\n\nI, 472:\u2014When a son and heir to the ruler of a State was born . . . . the master of the archers took a bow of mulberry wood and six arrows of the wild Rubus (p'eng), and shot towards heaven, earth and the four cardinal points. After this the nurse received the child. Nearly the same is related, II, 452.\n\nLegge in translating p'eng by Rubus, has evidently in view the \u84ec\u84ec p'eng lei [P., XVIIIa, 7]. It is figured in Ch. [XXII, 7] and is indeed a Rubus. In Japan the same Chinese name is applied to R. crataegifolius, Bge, and R. pectinellus, Maxim. [See Phon zo, XXV, 7, 8.] But whether the p'eng in the above passages of the Li ki means a raspberry bush is very doubtful.\n\nV. supra, 15.

Its leaves resemble those of the \u8eca\u524d ch'e ts'ien (Plantago). They are large, and also in taste they resemble that plant. In \u5f90\u5dde Suchou, in the district of \u5ee3\u9675 Kiang ling (Northern Kiangsu) the people use them for food.\n\nThe plant intended by Lu ki is Alisma plantago, L., mentioned under its present name in the Rh ya [v. supra, 95]. It is therefore improbable that the su or niu shan [Rh ya, 118] should denote the same plant.\n\nJap., 96, Alisma Plantago, L., \u6c34\u6fa4\u8541.\n\n438.\u2014\u5377\u8033 Kuan rh. This is the name of a plant which Legge calls the mouse's ear, and which is the title of an ode in the Shi king [8]:\u2014\n\nI was gathering and gathering the mouse's ear.\n\nMao calls it \u8475\u8033 ling rh, as does also the Rh ya [184].\n\nLu ki:\u2014The kuan rh, called also \u8475\u8033 si rh and \u80e1\u83dc hu si. The leaves are of a light green colour and resemble those of the \u80e1\u837d hu sui (Coriandrum sativum). It has a debile stem, white flowers. The plant is eaten cooked, it is mucilaginous. In the 4th month it is in fruit. The fruit resembles a lady's ear-pendent, wherefore the plant is also called \u8033\u64fc\u8349 rh tang ts'ao (ear-pendents herb). The people of \u95a9\u5dde Yu chou (Northern Chili) call it \u8475\u8033 taio rh.\n\nLegge makes Chu Hi say that the leaves of the kuan rh are like a mouse's ear and that it grows in bunchy patches. But Chu does not refer to the leaves, he only says it\nresembles a mouse's ear, and I think he had rather in view the fruit of the plant. Legge quotes the Rh ya i, where it is stated that the fruit of the kuan rh is like a mouse's ear and prickly, sticking to people's clothes.\n\nP., XV, 64, si rh. Li Shu-chien says the fruit resembles the mulberry and is prickly. The Pen ts'ao king calls the plant \u8457\u8033 ts'ang rh. This is now the vulgar name for the Xanthium strumarium, L., a common weed throughout China. It has a small, oblong, prickly fruit. It is represented in the Kiu huang [LI, 22] and in Ch. [XI, 50].\n\nAmer. exot., 892:\u2014\u8457\u8033 sooni vulgo namoue. Xanthium Lappa minor. So moku, XX, 25:\u2014Same Chinese name. Xanthium strumarium.

Legge adds:\u2014From the preface (of the Shi) it appears that these seeds were thought to be favourable to child-bearing. They are still thought in China to be helpful in difficult labours.\n\nThe Rh ya [200] gives as a synonym for fou i \u8eca\u524d ch'e ts'ien, which is still the common Chinese name for Plantago.\n\nLu ki:\u2014Fou i, other names ma si, ch'e ts'ien [as in the Rh ya], \u7576\u9053 tang tao.

The seeds are used as a medicine, especially in difficult parturition. The people of \u95a9\u5dde Yu chou (Northern Chili) call it \u725b\u820c\u8349 nu she ts'ao (ox tongue).

The people of \u63da\u5dde Yang chou (Anhni, Chekiang) call it \u7f8a\u8e44 yang ti (sheep's foot). It is (the root is meant, it seems) like the \u85a4\u670d lu fu [the Radish, see the *Rh ya*, 39].

Legge thinks that it is the sorrel, Rumex acetosa, but notices that in the Japanese plates it appears as Equisetum (horse tail) which is evidently a mistake.\n\nShi king, 164:\u2014There in the oozy grounds of the Hwun (\u6c7e Fen, a river in Shansi) they gather the sorrel (mo). Mao explains that mo is a vegetable.\n\nLu ki:\u2014The stem of the mo is as thick as a goose-quill, of a red colour, and giving out at every joint leaves like the willow, thick and long, covered with hairy prickles. It is of a sour taste and when young can be boiled into soup. It is also eaten raw. Its common name in China is \u9178\u8ff7 suan mi. In \u8ca2\u5dde Ki chou (Chili) it is called \u4e7e\u7d68 kan kiang (dry red), in \u6cb3\u6c7e Ho Fen (Shausi) it is \u8349 mo.\n\nThe above account would agree in a general way with Sorrel, but that plant is glabrous.\n\nP.

[See the Rh ya, 112].\n\nShi king, 303:\u2014I travelled through the country gathering the pokeweed. Mao explains fu by \u6076\u83dc (bad vegetable). The fu is mentioned in the Rh ya [51].\n\nLu ki:\u2014Fu. In Yu chou (Chili) it is called \u71d5\u85af yen fu. It has a white root. The people eat it baked in hot ashes, especially in years of scarcity, when it appeases hunger. In the time of the Han dynasty it was used in certain sacrifices. There are two kinds. One of them, with small leaves and red flowers, has an offensive smell.\n\nP., XVIIIa, 27, \u65cb\u82b1 sian hua, also \u65cb\u85af sian fu, a creeping plant with an edible root; root and flowers used in medicine.

Legge calls it the small grass or Polygala japonica.\n\nShi king, 229 [\"Life in Pin\"]:\u2014In the fourth month the small grass (yao) is in seed.\n\nMao explains yao by a plant. Rh ya, 194, yao yao or ki yuan.\n\nLegge says:\u2014It is described as like hemp, with flowers of a yellowish red, and a sharp pointed leaf. Among other names given to it is that of si ts\u2018ao (small grass). Legge translates evidently Kuo Po's commentary on the Rh ya.\nThe passage in question reads \u4f3c\u9ebb\u9ec3\u8d64\u83ef\u8449\u92b3\u800c\u9ec3\u5176\u4e0a\u8b02\u4e4b\u5c0f\u8349, which I understand to mean: it resembles the ma huang (Ephedra), has red flowers, pointed leaves. Its top is called small plant. Kuo P'o says that the yao yao of the Rh ya is the \u9060\u5fd7 yu\u00e1n chi. This latter name at Peking is applied to Polgala tenuifolia, Willd., and P. sibirica, L. P., XIIb, 21, Drawings, Kiu huang, LIII, 5, Ch. VII, 13.\n\nSo moku, XIII, 8, \u9060\u5fd7, Polygala japonica, Hout.

The flowers of Leonurus are red). Some ancient authors call it \u83ca\u862d an la (this is an Artemisia), others \u76ca\u6bcd i mu (mother's help). The Pen ts'ao terms it \u8352\u851a ch'ung wei.

This character is met with in the Shi king and in the Chou li. Legge translates it by orach (Atriplex), also by \"useless plants.\"\nShi king, 272:\u2014In the hills of the north (in Chou) is the lai. 323, 365:\u2014The country is overgrown with lai (useless plants).\n\nLu ki:\u2014Lai is the name of a weed. It is also called li [see the next]. The leaves may be eaten. The people of Yen chou (South-western Shantung) eat them cooked.\n\nIn the Chou li we have the term tien lai (a fallow field). Williams [Dict., 499] thinks that lai is the sow-thistle (Sonchus). But it is more probable that it is a synonym for li (Chenopodium). [See the next.]\n\n446.\u2014Li. Mentioned in the Li ki. Legge translates it by orach (Atriplex). [See the quotation in 431.]\n\nP., XXVII, 28, li. It is the same as the lai of the Shi king, as Li Shi-chen believes. It is also called hung sin hui tiao. Chenopodium with a red heart. In ancient times they called this plant li ho. This term is used in the Huai nan tsze and in Chuang tsze. The young leaves may be eaten.\n\nSo moku, IV, 40, and Phon zo, L, 7, li or Chenopodium album, L.\n\nIn the above name hui tiao, the character tiao is a general name for Chenopodium [v. Rh ya, 11]; hui means ashes, and refers to the white meal with which the leaves of some species are covered. The young shoots and spikes often assume a reddish colour.\n\nFa Hien, when he returned, in A.D. 414, by sea from his long journey to the Buddhist countries, landed in the Province of Shantung. In the Fo kuo ki [see Beal's Si yu ki, Introduction, LXXXII] it is stated that on seeing the li ho vegetable again, the traveller was confident that this was indeed the land of Han (China). I have no doubt that the first two characters, not\nfound in K.D., are intended for \u85dc\u85ff li ho, and that Fa Hien saw the Chenopodium album, a very common weed in Northern China.\n\nJap., 574, Chenopodium album, L., \u85dc.\n\" 575, \" ambrosioides, L., \u571f\u8346\u82a5.\nCompare Jap., 323, Basella rubra, L., \u843d\u8475, supra, 148.\n\" 337, Beta vulgaris, L., \u606d\u83dc.\n\" 2117, Spinacia oleracea, Mill, \u83e0\u7a40\u83dc.\n\n447.\u2014\u82d3 K'in.

It creeps on the ground in marshes and low grounds impregnated with salt. Cattle are very fond of it.\n\nIt is unknown what plant the k'in was. The name \u9ec3\u82a9 huang k'in in China, as well as in Japan, is applied to Scutellaria.\n\nTatarinov [Catal, med, sin., 10]:\u2014The drug huang k'in is Radie Scutellaria viscidula, Bge.

This character in the Shi king is applied, as the Chinese commentators agree, to two different plants. One of them, according to Legge, who relies on the Japanese plates, is a pea or Lathyrus maritimus,\nShi king, 211:\u2014On the embankments are magpie nests. On the height grows the beautiful pea (t'iao).\n\nMao explains it only by name of a plant. [Compare the Rh ya, 87.]\n\nLu ki:\u2014The t'iao is also called \u85dc\u7a40 t'iao jao. The people of \u907c\u5dde Yu chou (Northern Chili) call it \u7ff9\u7a40 k'tiao jao. The stem of this plant is like that of the \u52aa\u8c46 lao tou (a kind of cultivated bean), but more slender. The leaves resemble those of the tsi li (Tribulus terrestris, see 427). Stem and leaves can be eaten raw, like the leaves of the \u5c0f\u8c46 siao tou (Phaseolus Mungo).\n\nP., XXVII, 27. Ch., IV, 22, k'tiao jao. Rude figure.

The flowers are numerous and of a purple colour. Rh ya, 164, 165.\n\nLu ki:\u2014The t'iao is also called \u9675\u6642 ling shi and \u9f20\u5c3e shu wei (rat's tail). It resembles the \u7389\u82bb wang ch'u [v. supra, 10] and grows in low damp places. The flowers appear in great profusion in the 7th and 8th months, are of a purple colour, like those of the \u7d2b\u8349 tsz' ts'ao (Lithospermum erythrorhizon). They afford a black dye and are used to dye the hair.\n\nThis account does not agree with Bignonia. Lu ki confounds several plants, it seems. But the ling t'iao or ling shi\nis *Bignonia grandiflora* or *Tecoma grandiflora*, Del., a beautiful climbing plant with large orange-coloured flowers, common in Chinese gardens. [For further particulars, v. supra, 165.]\n\nV. note to 354, *Vicia hirsuta*, Koch. The figure to P., XXVII, 27, looks more like *Lathyrus*.\n\nV. supra, 164, *Tecoma*.\n\n449.\u2014The plants *niao* and *n\u0101 lo*, mentioned together in the *Shi*, are correctly identified by Legge with the mistletoe and the dodder.\n\n*Shi king*, 390:\u2014They are your brethren, all assembled, they are like the mistletoe (*niao*) and the dodder (*n\u0101 lo*) growing over the pine and the cypress.\n\nMao explains the \u9ebb *niao* (pronounced also *tiao*) by \u5bc4\u751f *ki sheng* which is a name for the mistletoe. *Ki* means \"to lodge (on trees)\"; *sheng* \"to grow.\" Cheng Huan refers to the *Rh ya* [262].\n\nLu ki likewise says the *niao* is the same as the *ki sheng*, but the description he gives of the plant is not correct:\u2014Leaves resembling those of the \u756a\u6728 *tang lu* (*Phytolacca*), fruit like the \u8461\u8404\u5b50 *fu p'en tsz* (*Rubus*), of a dark red colour and a pleasant sweet taste.\n\nThe account given of the plant in question in P. [XXXVII, 13\u201315], where ancient authors are quoted, leaves no doubt that by *ki sheng* a *Viscum* or *Loranthus* is meant. It is said there that the plant grows as a parasite among the branches of various trees (mulberry tree, pine tree, poplar, liquidambar) and that its root is imbedded in the substance of the branches. Roundish, thick leaves, white flowers, red berries like small peas. Ch, XXXIII, 35, \u6851\u4e0a\u5bc4\u751f *sang shang ki sheng* (*ki sheng* on a mulberry tree).

Cheng H\u00e9an says it is called t'u sz' when growing on herbaceous plants and sung lo when growing on trees. I understand that he means by t'u sz' and sung lo different plants, not one plant with two names.\n\nThe sung lo in P., XXXVII, 15, is Viscum. Phan zo, XCHI, 10, 11, 12, \u677e\u863f\u690d, Viscum album, L., and Loranthus K\u00e4mpferi.\n\nThe Rh ya [131] says that n\u0101 lo or t'ang meug [see the next] is the same as t'u sz'.\n\nLu ki:\u2014The n\u0101 lo is now called t'u sz' (rabbit's silk). It twines around herbaceous plants, like gold wire. It is yellow or of a red colour and used in medicine. It is not to be confounded with the sung lo, which grows on trees and is of a green colour.\n\nT'u sz' or rabbit's silk is the common Chinese name for dodder, Cuscuta. Several species of it are known in China. The most common in the neighborhood of Peking\n\n---\n\n19 Ch., XXVII, 6 figures under the name \u85e4\u863f\u677e niao lo sung the Ipomoea quamoclit, L.

Legge says that Mao calls *t'ang* improperly the \u85e4 meng vegetable, and that the dodder plant is not eaten as food in China. The *tu sz* is, however, mentioned in the *Kiu huang* [XLIX, 9] among the edible plants eaten in time of scarcity. The seed is used in medicine.\n\n452.\u2014\u845b \u85e4 *Ku lei*. This plant is thrice mentioned in the *Shi king*. Legge calls it dolichos creeper. *Lei*, according to the *Kaang ya*, has the same meaning as \u85e4 *t'eng*, liana [*v. supra*, 255].\n\n*Shi king*, 10:\u2014In the south are the trees with curved drooping branches, with the dolichos creepers clinging to them. 119:\u2014*Ko lei*, title of an ode.

It resembles the \u71d5 \u85e4 *yen y\u0101* (a wild vine with edible fruit). It is a creeper with whitish leaves resembling those of the \u827e ai (*Artemisia vulgaris*). Its fruit is edible, but sour, not very pleasant. In \u95a9 \u5dde Yu chou (Northern Chili) they call this plant \u7a1a \u85e4 *t'ui (chui) lei*.\nT'AO HUNG-KING calls this plant \u5343\u6b72\u85e5, ts'ien sui lei (a thousand years liana). Under this name it is spoken of in P., XVIIIb, 42. It is figured in Ch., XXII, 50. It seems to be a Vitis.\n\nPhon zo, XXXII, 3, \u5343\u6b72\u85e5, Vitis fleecosa, Thhg.\n\n453.\u2014Lien.

Shi king, 186:\u2014The convolvulus spreads all over the waste.\n\nAccording to the Shuo wen, this plant is the same as the \u767d\u8518 pai lien (white lien) of the Pen ts'ao king.\n\nLu ki:\u2014The lien resembles the kua lou (in its leaves), but the leaves are smaller and more abundant (kua lou is Trichosanthes, v. supra, 23). The fruit is black, like the \u71d5\u8581 yen yu (a vine with edible fruit), not edible. In \u95a9\u5dde Yu chou (Northern Chili) they call it \u70cf\u670d wu fu.

I may observe that our European ribbon grass, the *Phalaris arundinacea*, L., is a common plant in North China. [*Compare infra*, 461.]\n\n455.\u2014There appear in the Classics a number of Chinese names of plants referring evidently to reeds, rushes, sedges and the like. Only a few of these terms are still in use; the greater part have disappeared, probably a long time ago, from the spoken language.\n\nWe have first the \u83d6 *wei* and the \u84bf *lu*, both names applied in Northern China to the common reed *Arundo phragmites*, L. Three or four more names for reeds, now obsolete, occurring in the odes of the *Shi king*, are said by some of the ancient commentators to refer to the various stages in the process of growth of the common reed or others. I quote the passages where these names are mentioned:\n\n*Shi king*, 104:\u2014Who says that the \u6cb3 Ho (Yellow River) is wide? With a bundle of reeds (\u83d6 *wei*) I can cross it. 228 [\"Life in Pin\"]:\u2014In the eighth month are the sedges (\u8411 *huan*) and reeds (\u83d6 *wei*). 337:\u2014Deep looks the pool and abundantly grow the rushes (\u8411 *huan*) and reeds (\u83d6 *wei*). 472:\u2014In thick patches are those rushes (\u83d6 *wei*) by the way. Let not the cattle and sheep trample them.\n\n*Hia Calendar*, 80 [\u4e03\u6708\u83a0\u7a40\u8349]. *Douglas* translates:\u2014In the seventh month flourish the creeping plants and rushes. The fourth character, *kuan*, which *Douglas* renders by creeping plants, is evidently a mistake for \u8360 *huan*. See the corresponding sentence [above quoted] *Shi king*, 228 [\"Life in Pin.\"]\nLi ki, I, 277 [Y\u00fce ling]:\u2014Third month of summer. Orders are given to the superintendent of the meers to collect and send in the rushes available for use (\u6797 \u8349).\n\nDoctrine of the Mean, 269:\u2014Their government might be called an easily growing rush (\u84b2 \u8349 p'u lu). Legge says lu is the same as wei [c. supra], which, as well as p'u, is the name of various rushes or sedges. Regarding p'u see 375.\n\nShi king, 36:\u2014Strong and abundant grow the rushes (\u846d kia).\n\n96:\u2014\n\nThe waters of the \u6cb3 Ho (Yellow River), wide and deep,\nFlow northward in majestic course;\nThe nets are dropt into them with a flashing sound,\nAmong shoals and sturgeon, large and small,\nWhile the rushes (\u846d kia) and sedges (\u83fc t'an) are rank about.\n\n195:\u2014The reeds (\u84b9 kien) and rushes (\u846d kia) are deeply green. 121:\u2014His robes of rank glitter like the young sedge (\u83fc t'an).\n\nRegarding the above terms we find the following explanations in the Rh ya, the Shuo wen and the ancient commentaries:\n\n\u84b2 lu, according to the Rh ya [213] is the same as \u84bf kia, and [in 211] the Rh ya identifies kia with \u83d6 hua (flower). Mao says kia is the same as \u84bf wei, and Li S\u00fcn that the wei when it begins to grow is called kia. Shuo wen:\u2014Kia is a name for the wei before it has flowered, and wei is explained by ta kia (the great kia). Rh ya, 210:\u2014Wei, same as \u9b5a \u82b3 ch'ou t'iao. Shuo wen:\u2014\u82b3 t'iao, same as the wei in flower. Hing Ping explains that wei is a term applied to the lu when it is full grown, in grain.\n\nFrom the above quotations it appears that the names lu and wei in ancient times were referred to the same plant as nowadays. Lu and wei are common names in Northern\nChina for the *Phragmites communis*, Trin., (*Arundo phragmites*, L.) the common reed. In Hupei, according to Henry [l.c., 253], \u8606\u67f4 lu ch'ai is *Phragmites Roxburghii*, Kth. The character ch'ai means faggots.\n\n\u84b9 kien, according to Legge, a kind of rush or sedge. Rh ya, 212, same as \u85e4 lien. Kuo P'o says it resembles the \u837b huan. The Shuo wen explains kien by huan which has not yet flowered.\n\nThe character \u837b huan with the meaning of reed is not found in the Rh ya. But we have there [25] the same character pronounced kia or ch'ui and applied to *Leonurus*. The Shuo wen writes this character \u8568 huan and identifies it with \u85e4 wan [see the next].\n\nWilliams [Dict., 247] says \u8568 and \u837b huan may denote the same plant, but this is probably rather a sort of *Juncus* or *Cyperus*, as it has no blossoms. Legge translates \u8568 huan in the Shu king by rush mats. [305]:\u2014The rush mat (huan) below and that of fine bamboo above.\n\nThe Shuo wen explains this character by:\u2014A plant fit for making mats. Cheng Huan says, regarding the same character:\u2014It is the name of a plant which grows in a bushy manner, in the water. It has a round stem. In Kiangnan mats are woven of it. It resembles a small \u7011 p'u, but has no fruit. [Compare the Rh ya, 98.] According to Kuo P'o this character is to be pronounced kuan. [See also the Rh ya, 16.] The Shuo wen states that the plant \u85e4 lien is also a kind of huan. [V. supra, 176.]\n\nThe \u85e4 t'an in the Rh ya [214] is identified with the \u85e4 wan. The young sprouts are called \u96de k'\u00fcan. Mao says the t'an is also called \u96de chui (properly a pigeon). It is a name for the young sprouts of the \u8606 lu. Hing Ping says that \u85e4 ti is another name for it.\nPLANTS MENTIONED IN CLASSICAL WORKS.\n\nLU KI gives the following account of the above-mentioned reeds:\u2014The *kien* grows in water. Cattle thrive on it when it is in seed, and get fat and strong. The people of \u9752\u5dde Ts'ing chou and \u5f90\u5dde S\u016b chou (Northern Shantung and Northern Kiangsu) call it *kien*, and in \u5955\u5dde Yen chou (South-western Shantung) and Liaotung they use the same name. The \u845b *kia* is the same as \u845b *hu*. The \u7a17 *t'an* or \u85a4 *wan* is also called \u85a4 *ti*. In autumn, when the plant is getting hard and its seeds ripen the people term it \u85a4 *huan*. Its heart (marrow) is pulled out from below. The root is of the size of a goose's quill, tapering. The people of Yang chou (Chekiang, Anhui) call it \u9a6c\u5c3e (horse's tail).\n\nKUNG YING-TA is of opinion that the above classical names of plants refer to three kinds of reed. He says one of these plants is called *kia* when it begins to grow, *lu* when it flowers, and *wei* when it is full grown and in seed (this is the common reed, *Phragmites communis*). Another plant is called *t'an* when it begins to grow, *t'an* when it increases in growth, and *huan* when it is in seed. The third plant is the *kien*.\n\nThe common reed, *Phragmites communis*, is treated of in P., XV, 76, *lu*, *wei*, *kia*. A good drawing of the plant is found in Ch., XIV, 10. The \u82a6 *ku huang*, LIII, 13, figures under the name \u82a6\u7b0b *lu sun* (*lu* sprouts) a young plant of this reed. The sprouts of the *Phragmites communis* are eaten in China like those of the *p'u* or *Typha*, and are also employed in medicine. At Peking coarse mats are woven of the split reed.\n\n*Aman exot.*, 900, \u82a6 I, vulgo assi, jussi. Arundo palustris vulgaris, foliis latioribus, calamis firmis, ex quibus puto penicilla scriptoria confici. Phon zo, XVI, 9-11, \u82a6, *Phragmites communis*.\nLi Shi-chen [in P., l.c.], in accordance with K'ung Ying-ta's classification of the reeds, distinguishes three kinds, viz.:\u2014\n\n1.\u2014Culm more than 10 feet high, hollow inside; skin thin, of a whitish colour. It is called kia, wei and lu. This is the common reed already spoken of. [Comp. Henry, l.c., 253.]\n\n2.\u2014Culm shorter and smaller than that of the wei or lu, hollow inside; skin thick, of a dark green colour. This is called tan, wau, ti or huan.\n\n3.\u2014The kien, a small reed with a solid stem (not hollow inside).\n\nI am not prepared to say what reeds or reed-like plants were denoted by ti, alias tan, wau, and by kien in the Classics. The name ti is still used in China for a peculiar kind of small reed. [Compare an article by a contributor to Notes and Queries on China and Japan, 1869, p. 97, on the \"Reeds of the Yang tsz.\" The author of this interesting paper states, from his own observation it seems, that the immense reeds grown along the banks of the Great River are of two kinds, one called the lu, the other the ti. The former is said to grow towards the mouth of the river, near Nanking and Chinkiang, the latter higher up, in the vicinity of Anking, where there is a river known as the Ti kiang, after the reeds produced along its banks. Outwardly there is little difference in the appearance of these reeds; the chief distinction is that the lu are hollow, and the ti pithy inside. Perhaps the ti is a plant well known to botanists, but which has not yet been identified with the Chinese name, which is sometimes also written ti.\n\nThe Phon zo figures [XVI, 11, 13] under two gramineous plants, not identified by Franchet. In Siebold's Syn. plant. wau jap. [39] appears as one of the Chinese names\napplied to *Erianthus japonicus* [c. supra, 188]. The *So moku* [XVI, 35] gives \u84bf as the Chinese name for *Gnaphalium margaritaceum*, L. But this may be a mistake, for Hoffm. & Schultes [50] apply the character \u84bf [pronounced ts'ia in Chinese, W.D., 1001] to the same plant.\n\nWith respect to the \u8349 hu\u00e1n, a rush, of which in ancient times mats were made, I may notice that in Hoffm. & Schultes [308] *Juncus effusus*, L., appears with the Chinese names \u71c8\u5fc3\u8349 (lamp-wick grass), \u5e2d\u8349 (grass for making mats) and \u8349. The pith of this rush is largely used in China for lamp-wicks. Mats are also made of *Juncus effusus*, as Henry [l.c., 450] reports. [See also P., XV, 91, and Ch. XIV, 37.]\n\nVery fine mats, said to be manufactured in the interior of China, are sold at Peking under the name of \u9f8d\u9b1a\u5e2d lung s\u016b si (dragon's whisker mats). The lung s\u016b plant, also called \u77f3\u9f8d\u82bb sh\u00ed lung ch'iu and \u61f8\u8352 hu\u00e1n hu\u00e1n, is spoken of in P. [XV, 90] as a plant of which mats are woven. [Comp. Rh ya, 16, 176; Ch., XI, 39.]\n\n*Phon zo*, XVI, 21, \u77f3\u9f8d\u82bb, figured as a fine-leaved grass.\n\nIn an interesting article on the sources of China matting, published in the *Journal of Botany*, 1879, p. 99, the late Dr. Hance noticed the *Lepironia mucronata*, Rich., (*Cyperaceae*) and the *Cyperus tetanifloris*, Roxbg., as furnishing the material for mats at Canton.\n\n*Siebold*, *Syn plant. wcon. jap.*, 42:\u2014*Zizania palustris*, kojosi, \u85e4.

A plant mentioned in the Li ki, the Chou li and the Rh ya. Legge calls it a reed. It was employed by sorcerers.\n\nChou li, II, 248:\u2014Le p\u00eacher (\u6843 t'ao) et la plante lie employ\u00e9s dans la c\u00e9r\u00e9monie du serment. Commentator B. (Cheng Huan):\u2014Le p\u00eacher est redout\u00e9 des esprits. Les vergettes faites avec la plante lie servent \u00e0 expulser les mauvais pr\u00e9sages.\n\nLi ki, I, 172:\u2014When a ruler went to the mourning rites for a minister, he took with him a sorcerer (\u5deb) with a peach wand (\u6843), an officer of prayer with his reed [brush] (lie) and a lance-bearer, disliking [the presence of death]. Cheng Huan explains lie by \u5d07\u82e5 huan t'iao, and says it has the power to sweep away evil. Regarding huan, see 455; the second character stands for \u82b3 (reeds in flower). [V. Rh ya, 210].\n\nTso chuan, 544, 547:\u2014Accordingly a sorcerer was employed, who first executed the sprinkling with a branch of a peach tree and some reeds (\u6843 \u8449).\n\nThe character lie in the Rh ya is applied to three different plants [35, 142, 193] but not to a reed.\n\nAs to the peach wand employed in sorcery, it seems not quite sure that by t'ao in the above-quoted passages really a peach tree is to be understood. In the Shan hai king \u6843\u679d t'ao chi (peach branch) is repeatedly mentioned as the name of an herb, sometimes also as the name of a tree. The Shan hai king mentions also a plant \u920d\u7aef kou tuan. Kuo P'o says it is a kind of t'ao chi. The Kuang ya gives both names as\nsynonyms. Finally, in the Rh ya [170] it is plainly stated that the t'ao chi is a kind of bamboo.\n\nV. supra, 193.\n\n457.\u2014T'ai (now written \u7ae0). Legge says a kind of rush.\n\nShi king, 272:\u2014In the hills of the south (of Chou) is the t'ai. 409:\u2014Hats (li) of the leaves of the t'ai (\u7b20).\n\nIn the Rh ya [73] it is called fu s\u016bn (poor man's need). It has also been identified, but incorrectly, with the plant described in the Rh ya [97, q.r].\n\nLu ki:\u2014Its old name is fu s\u016bn. It is also called \u83d6\u8349 so ts'ao. The plant can be made into rain-cloaks (\u84d1 so) and hats (\u7b20 li). Some say that it was used for the black silken caps of the officers. The soft smooth skin of the plant is fit for making umbrellas impervious to rain. In the southern mountains it is a common plant.\n\nThe Rh ya i, after having noticed the t'ai or so plant used for making rain-cloaks and hats, speaks of another so plant in the following terms:\u2014The stalks and leaves of the so are like those of the \u4e09\u7a08 san leng (the three-cornered grass). [The genera Cyperus and Scirpus and other Cyperaceous plants have generally triangular stems]. The roots resemble the \u9634\u5b50 fu tsz (small tubers of Aconite) are very hairy, and known under the name of \u9999\u9634\u5b50 hiang fu tsz (fragrant fu tsz).\n\nThese tubers are generally of the size of an apricot kernel, but sometimes as large as a jujube. This is the Cyperus rotundus [v. supra, 97].\n\nAs to the other so plant, the t'ai of the Shi king, used for making hats and rain-cloaks, these names have been referred by Japanese botanists to various Cyperaceous plants.\n\nSiebold, Syn. plant. \u00e6con. jap., 10:\u2014Scirpus macrostachyus (same as Sc. maritimus, L.) \u96e8\u8863\u8349 (rain-cloak grass) or Japonice suge.

Ibidem, 192, \u6c99\u8349, Cyperus Iria, L.\n\nJapanese hats made of the kusa suge or Scirpus maritimus were exhibited in 1878 at Paris. [See M\u00e8ne, Prod. v\u00e9g\u00e9t. du Japon, 1885, p. 138.]\n\nMao explains the character \u9769 so by \u8349\u8863 (clothes made of grass). Kung Ying-ta adds that these clothes protect against rain. [Comp. also Shu king, 108. Tribute of Y\u00fc:\u2014The wild people of the islands brought garments of grass \u8863\u670d hui fu.]\n\nNowadays the Chinese agricultural labourers wear rain-coaks, so-i and hats made out of the hair-like bracts of a palm, the Chamaerops Fortunei, Lindl. [See Fortune's Wanderings, 53, 54.]\n\nV. supra, 73, 97.\n\nJap., 452, Carex distalatha, Boott, \u81fa.\n\n458.\u2014The Shan hai king mentions a plant \u756a\u8349 fan ts'ao. Kuo P'o explains that it is the \u9752\u7a40 ts'ing fan, which resembles the \u6c99 so but is larger. He evidently means the \u9752\u7a40 ts'ing fan, a plant mentioned in one of the poems of Sz'ma Siang-ju [\u2020 126 B.C.], together with the \u6c99 so, and the \u85af sie, and in Chang Heng's poem Nan tu fu [After Han dynasty] together with \u85af piao, \u83a0 huan and \u828b ch'un. The Shuo wen says that the ts'ing fan resembles the so. Thus we may suppose that it was a cyperaceous plant.\n\nAs to the other plants noticed by the ancient poets, the ch'un is Boehmeria nivea [v. supra, 391], the huan a rush [see 455]. Regarding the piao, a sedge grass, see the Rh ya [209].\n\nThe \u85af sie is said by a commentator on Sz'ma Siang-ju to be the same as the \u85af\u84bf [see the Rh ya, 119]. But the dictionary yu pien explains it by so.\n\nAman. exot., 900, \u85af, setz, vulgo suge. Herba palustris, folis arundinaceis brevioribns tensis, ex quibus ad albedinem\nredactis constrnuntur elegantissimi pilei, quibus teguntur deambulantes feminae. Suge, as we have seen, is the Japanese name for *Scirpus maritimus*.\n\n459.\u2014\u8305 Mao or \u767d\u8305 pai mao (white mao), a grass repeatedly mentioned in the Classics. Legge calls it the white grass.\n\n*Shi king*, 34:\u2014A dead antelope wrapped up with the white grass (pai mao). 232 [\"Life in Pin\"] :\u2014Let us in the daytime collect the grass (mao) and at night twist it into ropes. 416:\u2014The fibres from the white-flowered rush. \u767d\u83ef\u7ba1 [see the next] are bound with the white grass (pai mao).\n\n*Chou li*, I, 84:\u2014Le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au territoire hors banlieue fournit quand il y a des sacrifices les plantes odorif\u00e9rantes [shao, v. 435] et les herbes pour envelopper (mao).

II, 165:\u2014At the burial of a great officer, the progress of the bier was guided by the chief artizan with a reed of white grass (mao) in his hand.\n\nTso ch'ian, 139, 140. [B.C. 655.] Legge's translation reads:\u2014Your tribute of covered cases of the three-ribbed rush [the Chinese text has only \u8cde\u5305\u8305, tribute of mao grass for wrapping up,] is not rendered, so that the king's sacrifices are not supplied with it, and there is nothing with which to strain the spirits.\n\nSee also the Rh ya [183].\n\nLi Sao, 55:\u2014Les herbes tsuen et honi [fragrant herbs, v. 417, 406] sont transform\u00e9es en herbes mao ou mauvaises herbes.\n\n---\n\n20 It is not to be confounded with the \u8305\u9999 mao hiang, a fragrant grass, according to Loureiro, Flora cochin., T33, Andropogon schenanthus, L., Comp. P., XIVb, 68; Ch., XXV, 71. Phon zo, XI, 8.\nLu ki, 23:\u2014In ancient times the white mao was used to wrap up things offered in sacrifices, and also for straining wine.\n\nP., XIII, 45, pai mao. Li Shi-chen says:\u2014Mao is a general name including several species. Besides the pai mao there are the huang mao or yellow mao, the hiang mao or fragrant mao, the kien mao [see the next] and others. All these have the same leaves. The difference is in the flowers. The pai mao or white mao is a small plant. It flowers in the fourth month; white flowers in panicles; small seeds. Its root is white, very long and thin, resembling a sinew; it has joints, is of a sweet taste. In the Pen ts'ao king this drug is called \u8305\u6839 mao ken (mao root). It emits light in the night. The plant is also used for thatching houses.\n\nIn the Peking mountains the people apply the name mao to Imperata arundinacea, Cyrill, and I. sacchariflora, Maxim., beautiful grasses with long leaves and spike-like panicles, with long silvery white silky hairs on the glumes. The plant represented under pai mao in Ch., VIII, 8, may be an Imperata. The Kiu huang [LIHI, 14] figures the young sprouts with the root of the mao grass. These sprouts are eaten by the people, like those of Typha and Phragmites. P. [l.e.] terms them \u8305\u9488 mao chen (mao needles).\n\nAccording to Loureiro [Flora cochin., 67], in South China the Chinese name mao ken (mao root) is applied to Saccharum spicatum, L., (radice perenni, repente, articulata). This plant is now called Perotis latifolia, Ait. Henry [l.e., 272, 433]:\u2014In Hupei, Imperata arundinacea, Cyr., is called mao or sz\u2018 mao (silky mao).\n\nAman. exot., 899, \u8305boo, vulgo tsubanna. Gramen arundinaceum canle longiori, panicula sparsa. Thunberg thinks [Flora jap., 42] that K\u00e4mpfer refers to Saccharum spicatum. But Thunberg's S. spicatum, in Franchet and Savatier's Enum. Pl. Jap., II, 188, is referred to Imperata arundinacea. In Siebold's Syn. plant. accon. jap., 46, we have amame,\nPLANTS MENTIONED IN CLASSICAL WORKS.\n\nGraminea obscura, in gonorrhoea ab agricolis laudata. See also the plants figured in the Phon zo, VIII, 1, 2, under \u8305 and \u767d\u8305. At Peking Anthistiria arguens, Willd., is called \u9ec4\u8305 huang mao. The mountain people use this coarse grass provided with rigid awns, for thatching roofs. Henry [l.c., 142] refers the huang mao figured in Ch., VIII, 10, to Heteropogon hirtus, Pers., which he terms \"spear grass\" and which at Ichang is much used for thatch.\n\nIt cannot be ascertained what the \u9752\u8305 tsing mao of the Shu king was. It is noticed there [112, \"Tribute of Y\u00fc.\"] as a product of the Province of \u8346\u5dde King chon (Hukuang). Legge calls it the three-ribbed rush. The three-ribbed rush (when presented as tribute) was put in cases, which again were wrapped up.\n\nCheng Huan explains that this grass was a kind of mao, having three ridges (\u4e09\u810a) and provided with hairs and prickles (stiff awns), and used for straining the sacrificial wine. Kung An-kuo takes tsing and mao to be different, and suggests that tsing is mentioned in the Chou li as a vegetable [v. supra, 361]. But there is a statement by \u7ba1\u5b50 Kuan tsz' [who lived in the 7th century B.C.] which has come down to us, saying that between the Kiang and the Huai river (Kiangsu, Anhui) a grass is found whose leaves have three ridges and which is called \u9752\u8305 tsing mao.\n\nI may notice that Siebold [Syn. plant. accon. jap., 45] mentions a Graminea obscura tinctoria since \u9752\u8305, japonice karias. This is, I suspect, the Imperata tinctoria, Miq., [Prol. Fl. japon, 177]:\u2014Ad viride tingendum adhibetur, teste Siebold. But according to Kempfer [v. infra, 461] karrias is Phalaris arundinacea.\n\nAnother kind of mao grass is, according to Li Shi-ch'en, the \u8001 mang, regarding which see the Rh ya [188].\nJup., 1146, Imperata arundinacea, Cyr., \u767d\u8305.

In the Shi king [146] the character \u8305 tu, generally applied to the sow-thistle, denotes, according to the Chinese commentators, the kien grass [c. supra, 365].\n\nIn the Rh ya [48] we have the wild kien, also called the\nwhite-flowered. Kuo Pio says it is a kind of mao. Mao explains that the kien is the same as the mao, which after it has been steeped is called kien. In the Shan hai king it is stated that mats were made out of the white kien and used in the sacrifices to the mountain spirits. Li ki, II, 169, \"Mourning Rites.\" \u8457\u5c65 Legge translates \"sandals of straw.\"\n\nLu ki:\u2014The kien resembles the mao, but it is glabrous. The root contains a white flour. The plant is flexible. After steeping and drying it, strings and cordage can be made of its fibres.\n\nP., XIII, 45, speaks of the kien under the head of pai mao,\nas of a grass akin to the mao. It has prickly awns, flowers in autumn (the mao flowers in summer). Ch. [VIII, 9] figures under kien a Graminea which Henry [l.c., 343] identifies with Anthistiria ciliata, L., a kind of \"spear grass\" in Hupei where it is also known under the name of \u8305\u5b50\u8349 pao lez' ts'ao.\nThe pao grass is mentioned in the *Li ki* [I, 103]:\u2014One should not enter the ruler's gate in rush sandals (\u84c6\u5c65). The *Shuo wen* says the pao is a grass of which the people of \u5357\u967d Nan yang (Honan) make coarse shoes. In the *Han shu* [quoted in K.D.] it is stated that the pao is also fit for being woven into mats.\n\nThe *Tso chuan* [369, 372], referring to the year B.C. 580, quotes a passage from an ode of the *Shi king*, now lost, which reads as follows:\n\n> Though you have silk (\u7d72) and hemp (\u9ebb)\n> Do not throw away your grass (\u8349) and rushes.\n\nWhat Legge translates by rushes is \u8349 k'uai in the Chinese text. The ancient commentary says that it is a grass akin to the kien.\n\nThe *I li* [chapter on Mourning Rites] notices shoes made of k'uai and \u84c6 piao grass [*v. supra*, 458]. According to some authors of the Han, quoted in K.D., the k'uai was also used for making cords and mats.\n\n*P.*, XXIII, 14, k'uai. *Ch'en Ts'ang-k'i* [8th century] says that the seeds of the k'uai grass are eaten by the people like rice.\n\nHoffm. & Schultes, 538, \u84c6, *Scirpus cyperinus*, Kth. But the drawing in the *Phon zo* [XII, 17-18] under this Chinese name looks rather like *Andropogon tropicus*, Sprengel.\n\nKuo P'o, in commenting upon the *Shan hai king*, says that the \u84c6 kien, repeatedly mentioned there, is akin to the \u84c6 kien and the \u84c6 mao, and that the \u84c6 s\u00fcn, spoken of in the same work, is the same as the \u84c6 pao. Only the description of the s\u00fcn in the *Shan hai king* (yellow flowers, red fruit which makes those who eat it handsome) does not agree with this identification.\nJap., 2020, Scirpus Eriophorum, Michx., var. nipponicus, Fr. & S.\n\n461.\u2014L\u00fc, name of a plant mentioned in the Shi king. Legge terms it \"king grass.\" The character is more correctly written \u8607. 411:\u2014All the morning I gather the king grass, and do not collect enough to fill my hands.\n\nThe Rh ya [10] writes \u8449 l\u00fc, same as \u738b\u82bb w\u00e1ng ch'\u00fc (king grass). This name occurs in the Li sao. [See the quotation under 421, supra.]\n\nLu ki:\u2014The l\u00fc plant resembles the bamboo; it grows to the height of five or six feet. The people living on the \u6f22 K'i river (a tributary of the Wei, in the north-east of Honan) call it \u8449\u7af9 l\u00fc chu (l\u00fc bamboo) for the stem and the leaves are like the bamboo and of a dark green colour.\n\nThe Rh ya i says that the Pen ts'ao identifies the l\u00fc plant of the Shi with the \u8449\u8349 tsin ts'ao. This latter plant is treated of in P. [XVI, 86]. It is said there that it is also called huang ts'ao (yellow grass), for the plant affords a yellow dye (it is not stated whether the leaves or the root). In ancient times the people were obliged to collect this tinctorial plant for the king's stores, whence the name \"king's grass.\" Ch. [XI, 72] figures under tsin ts'ao the leaves of a grass.\n\nAmoen. exot., 899:\u2014\u85ba dsin, vulgo karrias, kakkina, arai. Gramen arundinaceum minus, Tab. Gramen arundinaceum spicatum, C.B.P. Judging from K\u00e4mpfer's references, this would be Phalaris arundinacea, L. [See also Thunberg, Flora japon., 44, and supra, 454 and 459 at the end.] Siebold says that karrias is the name of an obscure tinctorial plant in Japan. As far as I know, Ph. arundinacea is not a tinctorial plant. But the plant is common in China as well.\nas in Japan. The \u8349 in the Phon zo [XX, 14, 15] is not Phalaris.\n\nJap., 232, Arthraxon ciliare, Beauv., \u8349\u8349.\n\n462.\u2014\u72fc Lang. Legge calls it wolf's-tail grass, a kind of weed, or darnel.\n\nShi king, 224:\u2014Cold come the waters down from that spring and overflow the bushy wolf's-tail grass. 380:\u2014Picture of husbandry, growth of the grain described:\u2014\n\nIt ears and the fruit lies soft in the sheath,\nIt hardens and is of good quality,\nThere is no wolf's-tail grass, no darnel [yu, see the next].\n\nRh ya, 189, lang, same as \u72fc t'ung liang.\n\nCheng Huan explains:\u2014Grain that flourishes, but does not form seeds is called t'ung liang (blasted ears of grain).\n\nLu Ki repeats the above explanation and then says that now the people call the plant mentioned in the Shi, \u5bbf\u7530\u7fc1 Su t'ien weng or \u5bbf\u7530 shou t'ien. In the Wai ch'uan [Wylie's Notes, p. 6] it is stated that horses are fond of the lang and the yu [see the next].\n\nThe Rh ya i says that the lang plant is a bad weed growing in corn-fields among cultivated grain. But it affords a valuable food for cattle.\n\nP., XXIII, 14, \u72fc\u5c3e\u8349 lang wei ts'ao (wolf's-tail grass). It is said to be the same as the plant lang of the Shi king and of the Rh ya [189], and as the meng or lang wei (wolf's tail) of the Rh ya [20]. Li Shih-chen states that the plant resembles the su (Setaria italica), but its ears are of a yellowish purple colour and provided with bristles. In time of scarcity it supplies food. Ch., XIII, 25.\n\nThe drawing in the Phon zo [XLI, 15, 16] under \u72fc\u5c3e\u8349 seems to represent Gymnothrix japonica, Kth., figured in Thunberg's Flora japon. [p. 48, tab. 9] under the name of Panicum hordeiforme. It is also the same as his Cenchrus\nporpurascens, and a common plant in Japan and China. The long spike is conspicuous by the numerous purplish awnlike bristles that almost conceal the flower. This agrees with the Chinese description of the wolf's-tail grass.\n\n463.\u2014\u79c0 Yu. This is another gramineous weed in corn-fields, repeatedly mentioned in the Classics. Legge translates the name by weeds injurious to grain, darnel, fescue.\n\nShi king, 157:\u2014Do not try to cultivate fields too large; the weeds (yu) will only grow luxuriantly. 380:\u2014See the quotation supra in 462:\u2014No wolf's-tail grass, no darnel (yu).\n\nLi ki, I, 276, yu translated by darnel. See the quotation under 431.\n\nThe character yu occurs thrice in the Hia Calendar [56, 58, 80], but it seems that it stands there for \u79c0 sin (to flourish).\n\nMencius, 377:\u2014Mencius said, I hate the darnel (yu) lest it be confounded with the corn (\u82d7).\n\nThe Chinese commentators say the lang [see the preceding] and the yu are plants injurious to the grain (\u5bb3\u82d7). The Shuo wen says the yu is a plant which grows among grain. Not mentioned in the Rh ya.\n\nP., XVI, 63, \u72d7\u5c3e\u8349 kou wei ts'ao (dog's-tail grass). It is said to be the same as the yu of the Classics. Li Shu-ch'en says it is a common grass, resembling the su (Setaria italica), but is smaller. Ch., XII, 4, yu or kou wei ts'ao. The figure seems to be intended for Setaria viridis, Beauv., as also the drawing under the same names, Kin hsiang, LII, 8. At Peking even nowadays the classical name yu is applied to Setaria viridis, a very common grass. The people term it generally \u7a57\u83a0\u5b50 ku yu ts'ao (the yu of the grain).\n\nE. H. Parker, Chinese Names of Plants:\u2014The name kou wei ts'ao in Sz ch'unan is applied to Gymnothrix hordeiformis,\nBeauv., at Canton to Setaria glauca, Beauv.

A poisonous plant mentioned in\nthe Chou li [II, 389]:\u2014Le destructeur est charg\u00e9 d\u2019expulser\nles teignes. Il les attaque par le sacrifice conjuratoire. Il\nfait contre eux des fumigations avec la plante mang.\n\nThe same plant (mang ts'ao) is stated in the Shan hai king\nto be employed for stupefying fish. The same is said there\nregarding the plant \u8292\u8349 wang ts'ao.21\n\nThe character \u8292 mang has several meanings. According\nto the Rh ya [169] it is a kind of bamboo. The Fang yen\nsays that in the southern part of \u695a Ch'u (Hunan) it means\n\u8349 herbs. The Shuo wen explains the character by \u201cthick\ngrass, jungle.\u201d\n\nIn P. [XVIIb, 47] \u8292 mang is given as the name of a\npoisonous plant, also called \u8349 (to be pronounced wang),\n\n21 Kuo P'o here gives the pronunciation wang for the first character,\nwhich is generally pronounced mang. [V. supra, 188] where \u8292 mang\ndenotes a grass.\n\u8292\u8349 w\u00e1ng ts\u2019ao and \u9f20\u83bd shu m\u00e1ng (rat\u2019s m\u00e1ng). It is identified with the plant wei or ch\u2019un ts\u2019ao [Rh ya, 147]. From the ancient authors quoted in P., regarding the m\u00e1ng ts\u2019ao we learn that this plant is not uncommon in Sz\u2019ch\u2019nan and Central China. Some say it is a twining plant, others a tree. It is poisonous and employed by the people to poison fish and rats. Ch., XXIV, 52 represents under m\u00e1ng ts\u2019ao a plant with serrate leaves and flowers not unlike those of Aconite.\n\nIn Japan the Chinese character m\u00e1ng is applied to Illicium religiosum, Sieb., a small tree held sacred by the Japanese, and found also in Southern China. Its seeds and leaves possess poisonous properties. But the Chinese poisonous plant m\u00e1ng is quite different.\n\nAman, exot., 880, 881, \u8349\u83bd, skimmi, with figure, is Illicium religiosum.

Kuo P\u2019o says a medicinal plant. The Rh ya [258] writes \u829c yu\u00e1n; another name: \u9c7c\u6bd2 y\u00fa tu or fish-poison.\n\nThe ancient dictionary K\u00ec tsiu pien [1st century B.C.] states that the \u829c yu\u00e1n flowers when boiled and thrown into water kill fish. The Shuo wen explains yu\u00e1n by \u201cfish-poison.\u201d\n\nP., XVIII, 42, yu\u00e1n hua. Poisonous plant. A small tree with violet flowers; another sort has yellow flowers.

A plant mentioned in the *Li ki*. Legge translates broom-sedge. I, 304 [*Yue ling*]:\u2014Second month of winter. The broom-sedge rises up vigorously. Cheng Huan explains *li* by \u99ac\u9b1a *ma hui* (a fragrant plant). The *Shuo wen* says the *li* is an herbaceous plant which resembles the \u6f06 *p'ua* (*Typha*) but is smaller. The roots are made into brushes.\n\n*P.*, XV, 57, \u9e7f\u5be6 *li shi*, a name found in the *Pen ts'ao king*. The ancient authors say that the *li* of the *Li ki* refers to this plant. It has many other names, \u99ac\u9b1a *ma chou* (horse's broom), \u99ac\u862d *ma liu*, etc. The plant has violet flowers, the fruit is a capsule, seeds resemble hemp-seeds. The leaves resemble *Allium* leaves. The root is long, fine (fibrous), of a yellow colour. The people use it for making horse-brushes. The authors refer to this the plant *ping* or *ma chou* in the *Rh ya* [36]. Ch., XI, 42, *li shi*. The plant figured there is an *Iris*.

V. supra, 382]. The same definition we find already in the Shuo wen.\n\nChou li, I, 383:\u2014Les jardiniers sont pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s aux jardins et potagers appartenant \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat.

Cheng Huan explains kuo by \u6709\u6838 (having a stone) and lo by \u7121\u6838 (without a stone) and gives as examples of the first the jujube and the plum, and of the second \u74dc kua and \u74e0 hu (gourds and bottle-gourds).\n\nLi ki, I, 82:\u2014When a fruit (\u679c) is given by a ruler and in his presence, if there be a kernel (\u6838) in it, the receiver\nshould place it in his bosom. \u6838 Ho properly means the stone of a fruit; the kernel is \u4ec1 jen.

The exceedingly acid dried fruit of a *Prunus*, said to be brought from the south, is sold at Peking.\nunder the name of *suan mei* (sour plum) and used for preparing a refreshing beverage. I suspect this is *Pr. mume*, although this species does not appear in the *Index Flora sinensis*. I cannot say what *Prunus* the figure under *mei* [Ch., XXXII, 12] is intended for, but the *mei* described in P., XXIX, 11, is, I believe *Pr. mume*. Li Shih-chen says the leaves and fruit of the *mei* resemble those of the apricot; the fruit is acid; it is salted or dried or smoke-dried. In the latter state it is called *wu mei* (black plum).\n\nThe *yu ye mei* (*mei* with elm-leaves) a beautiful ornamental shrub frequently cultivated at Peking, is the *Prunus triloba*, Lindl.

This character in the Shi king [200] has the meaning \"thickly wooded,\" but in the ode \"Life in Pin\" [231] it denotes a fruit which Legge calls the sparrow-plum.

K'ung Ying-ta:\u2014A kind of t'ang ti [see 475].\n\nLu ki:\u2014The yu is a tree from 5 to 6 feet high.

In the Pie lu it is called \u96c0\u674e yu li. According to others, it is the \u96c0\u674e tsio li or sparrow-plum. Li Shih-chen says that the flowers of the yu li are of a rose colour, the fruit is like a small plum. He considers the yu li to be the same as \u5e38\u68e3 or \u68e3 [Rh ya, 306], but writes the first name \u85e4\u68e3 t'ang ti. It is said to be the same as the \u690d\u6728 yu mu in the Shan hai king.\n\nUnder the name of yu li they cultivate at Peking Prunus japonica, Thbg. It flowers in January. Small, white buttons of double flowers, appearing before the leaves. It is figured under yu li in Ch. [XXXIII, 51]. A rude drawing of it is also found in the Kiu huang [LVIII, 9].

Kuo P'o explains that it is a tree resembling the *pai yang* or white poplar, and is also called *fu i*. The *Shuo wen* writes the above name \u695d\u68e3 *t'ang ti* and identifies it with *i*.\n\nMao explains the *t'ang ti* in the *Shi king* by *i*, as in the *Rh ya*. P. [XXXVb, 29] refers the *t'ang ti* of the *Shi* to the tree \u67d8\u694a *fu i*, also called \u695d\u694a *i yang* (i poplar). Li Shih-chen [after the Ku kin chun, 4th century] describes it as a kind of poplar or aspen with quivering leaves.\n\nCh. XXXV, 4 gives *fu i* as a synonym for \u767d\u694a *pai yang*, the white poplar. The drawing in the *Phon zo* [LXXXIV, 24] under \u67d8\u694a seems to represent a *Populus*, but according to Siebold [*Flora Japonica*, I, 87, tab. 42, and icones, ined. III] this Chinese name is in Japan applied to *Aronia asiatica*, a small tree of the order *Pomaceae*, with white flowers in racemes. It is said to have been introduced into Japan from China.\nOther Chinese commentators take the t'ang ti of the Shi to be a kind of plum. Lu ki says it is the same as the \u8461\u8404 y\u016b li (grape plum), also called \u96c0\u6885 tsio mei (sparrow-plum), and \u8eca\u4e0b\u674e ch'e hia li (plum under the cart). It grows in the mountains, its flowers are both white and red. The fruit ripens in the sixth month, it is as large as a plum and edible.\n\nLegge agrees with this view that the t'ang ti was a kind of plum, for evidently from the text of the Shi it may be concluded that it is akin to the peach and the plum.\n\n*Aronia asiatica = Amelanchier Canadensis*, Torr. et Gray, var. japonica. Jap., 132, with Chinese name \u679c\u6a39. It occurs in Chekiang Province on the Tien-tai mountain, a beautiful tree when in flower. Fruit not seen.\n\n476.\u2014\u5e38\u7da0 Ch'ang ti. Legge calls it the cherry.\n\n*Shi king*, 250:\u2014The flowers of the cherry tree (chang ti) are they not gorgeously displayed? 260:\u2014Flowers of the cherry tree. In this passage the Chinese text has only the first character of the name \u5e38\u4e4b\u83ef (chang flowers).\n\nThe Rh ya [306] has \u5e38\u7da0 or \u7da0. Kuo P'o explains that the fruit resembles the ying t'ao (cherry).\n\nLu ki says:\u2014According to the Shuo wen the ch'ang ti or ti is the same the \u767d\u7da0 p'u ti or white ti. The fruit resembles the plum (li) but is smaller, of the size of a ying t'ao (cherry) and of a white colour. It is now cultivated in the government gardens (\u5bae\u5712). There is also the \u8d64\u7da0 ch'i ti (red ti). It resembles the white ti. The leaves are like those of the ts'e ts'e y\u016b or spiny elm (*Hemiptelea*) but rather orbicular. The fruit is red like that of the y\u016b li [see 474] but smaller; it ripens in the fifth month. The tree is very common in the north-western provinces.\n\nLi Shih-ch'en makes this tree to be the same as the y\u016b li, *Prunus japonica*, but writes \u5e38\u7da0 t'ang ti instead of \u5e38\u7da0.\n477.\u2014\u542b\u6843 Han t'ao, an ancient name for the cherry.\n\nLi ki, I, 273 [Yue ling]:\u2014Second month of summer. The Son of Heaven eats millet along with pullets and chorries (han t'ao). The commentary explains han t'ao by \u6a31\u6843 ying t'ao, which is now the common Chinese name for cherries. [V. supra, Rh ya, 266].\n\nAccording to the Index Flora sinensis there are 9 species of Prunus belonging to the section Cerasus or cherry, now known in China, including the already mentioned Pr. japonica.\n\nThe Pr. pseudocerasus, Lindl., or Bastard Cherry, was introduced into England, it seems, from Canton, by Dr. Reeves, in 1822. He calls it ying to. [See Transact. Hort. Soc. London, VI, 1826, p. 90.] This differs from our common cherry, in having its flowers growing in racemes, not fascicles, and in their stalks being hairy. The Double Chinese Cherry, Pr. serratula, Lindl., introduced likewise by Reeves under the name of yung to (evidently ying t'ao) proved afterwards to be identical with Pr. pseudocerasus.\n\nIn 1879, I sent herbarium specimens with flowers and fruits of the cherry cultivated at Peking under the name of ying t'ao to the late J. Decaisne, Paris. He declared them to be Pr. pseudocerasus. But Mr. Maximowicz, of St. Petersburg, to whom I had forwarded specimens from the same tree, found that they belonged to a distinct species, the Pr. pauciflora, Bge., which, however, seems closely allied to the former. This cherry in its appearance, colour and taste resembles much our common sour cherry.\n\nP., XXX, 41, ying t'ao. Good description. Kiu huang, LVIII, 1; Ch., XXXII, 17.\n\nIn May another cherry is offered for sale at Poking under the name of shan ying t'ao or mountain cherry. The fruit, produced on a very short stalk, is of a pale red, covered with\nsoft hairs; it has a peculiar flavour. This is the *Prunus tomentosa*, Thbg. It is found wild and cultivated in the Peking mountains, and is well known also in Japan.\n\n*P.*, XXX, 43, *shan ying t'ao*.

But a peach is not meant here.\n\nIn *P.* [XXX, 10] *mu t'ao* is given as a synonym for \u6aac\u5b50 *cho tsz*; name of a fruit which is mentioned in the *Rh ya* [331] and regarding which the *Shuo wen* says that it resembles a pear, but is of a sour taste. Li Shih-chen compares it to the *mu kna* or quince, but it is smaller, of a yellowish colour, sour and harsh.\n\nThe drawing in the *Phon zo* [LXIII, 10] under \u6aac\u5b50 refers perhaps to *Cydonia japonica*.\n\nIn the *Li ki* [I, 461], where the fruits eaten by the ancient Chinese are enumerated [*v. infra*, 484, note], there appears the name \u6aac cha [haws, according to Legge] together with \u679c li (the pear), and farther on we read [p. 462] cha (\u67e4) and pears (\u679c) had the insects drilled out of them. The \u6aac is repeatedly mentioned in the *Shan hai king*, and Kuo P'o explains that it is a fruit resembling the pear, but sour and harsh. According to the ancient dictionary *Kuang yun* [Tang dynasty], the character \u6aac is identical with \u6aac, and \u6aac is also the same.\n\nIt cannot be decided whether the cha was a quince or a hawthorn (*Crataegus*), or perhaps another *Pomacea*. The\n\u5c71\u6942 shan cha or mountain cha is *Crataegus*, [V. supra, Rh ya, 244.]\n\n480.\u2014Besides the wood-peach, the *Shi king* mentions also a wood-plum \u6728\u674e mu li. Legge translates [108]:\u2014There was presented to me a plum. The Chinese text has mu li.\n\nIn P. [XXX, 10] the mu li or wood-plum of the *Shi* is identified with the \u6885\u6885 ming cha, also called \u6728\u68a8 mu li, wood-pear. Li Shih-chien states that this fruit is a kind of mu kua or quince, but larger than the common mu kua; it is of a yellow colour. The ming cha is not figured in Ch.\n\n*Phon zo*, LXIII, 11, 12, \u6a31\u6843. The drawing seems to represent *Cydonia vulgaris*, with a large fruit.

Its leaves are luxuriant. 265:\u2014Solitary stands the russet pear tree with its fruit so bright.\n\nIn the Shan hai king we meet with the names \u68e0 t'ang and \u6c99\u68e0 sha t'ang.\n\nIn the Rh ya [242] we have \u675c tu same as \u7518\u68e0 kan t'ang, and [254] it is stated that tu is the red and t'ang the white sort.\n\nLu ki:\u2014The kan t'ang is also called \u675c\u68a8 tu li or \u8d64\u68e0 chi t'ang (red t'ang). There are two sorts of t'ang, the white and the red. The white is a good fruit and is also called kan t'ang or sweet t'ang. It is of a pleasant sourish taste and\nmucilaginous, whilst the fruit of the red t'ang is harsh and acid. There is a proverb saying \"harsh as a tu.\" But the wood of the red t'ang is tough and fit for making bows.\n\nP., XXX, 5, t'ang li or kan li. Li Shih-chen says that the t'ang li is a white pear, found everywhere in the mountains. Ch., XXXI, 40. The drawing represents a tree; evidently a Pyrus is intended, with a small globular fruit. Kiu-huang, LVI, 14, rude drawing.\n\nIt seems that the above-mentioned ancient names were applied to various wild-growing and cultivated species of Pyrus with small fruits, pears and crab apples, of which we know a considerable number in China and Japan.\n\nThere is in the Peking mountains a wild pear, the Pyrus sinensis, Lindl., (P. ussuriensis, Maxim.), which bears a globular fruit, about one inch in diameter, of a greenish brown colour, covered with little warts. Late in autumn, after frost, this fruit is offered for sale at Peking. It is known by the name \u6843\u679d\u68a8 t'ang tu li; its taste is not unpleasant.\n\nThe name \u675c\u68a8 tu li at Peking is applied to the Pyrus betulifolia, Bge., a species met with wild in the mountains and much cultivated in gardens for its beautiful flowers, which in April appear on the tree in great profusion, and for its little brown fruit of the size of a small cherry, which is eaten by the Chinese. Taste not unpleasant.\n\nThe Pyrus baccata, L., with a red edible fruit of the size of a pea, is common in the Peking mountains. It is called there \u5c71\u834a\u5b50 shan king ts'e. But this is merely a local name. Its book name is, it seems, \u6797\u6a8e lin kin, which, as has been stated above, under 301, is not a classical appellation.\n\nAccording to Henry [l.e., 446] in Hupei the name t'ang li is applied to Pyrus betulifolia.\n\nIn the Phon zo [LXIII, 5] the \u8d64\u68e0 or re.l t'ang is Pyrus toeringo, Sieb., (hitherto not found in China).

Legge calls it simply the wild pear tree.\n\nShi king, 201:\u2014In the low, wet grounds are the high, wild pear trees.\n\nSee the Rh ya [265], sui or \u7f57. Kuo P'o says that the fruit resembles a pear. The Shuo wen writes \u6843.\n\nLu ki:\u2014The sui is also called \u8d64\u7f85 ch'i lo or \u5c71\u68a8 shan li. The people now call it \u694a\u6843 yang sui or \u9e7f\u68a8 lu li (deer's pear), also \u9f20\u68a8 shu li (rat's pear). The fruit looks like a small pear and is sweet. This tree grows in \u9f4a Ts'i in the prefecture of \u5ee3\u9952 (now Lo-an hien in Shantung), in \u5357 Lu (South-western Shantung), in \u6cb3\u5167 Ho nei (Southern Shansi) and in the northern mountains; the people cultivate it also. The fruit has a delicate flavour not unlike that of the pear.\n\nP., XXX, 4, \u9e7f\u68a8 lu li. The above names given as synonyms. Li Shih-chen says that it is a common tree in the mountains, yielding a beautiful veined wood.\n\nSiebold, Icon, ined., III, \u9e7f\u68a8. A Pyrus with a small red fruit. See also the drawing under the same Chinese name in the Phon zo [LXIII, 3]. According to Geerts [Japan Woods] this Chinese name in Japan is applied to Sorbus aucuparia, L.

This is the classical and common name for the Chinese jujube, Zizyphus vulgaris, Lam., cultivated in China from time immemorial it seems. It has produced\nmany varieties. Europeans in China erroneously call this fruit the date, as also does Legge. The Japanese jujubes are likewise furnished by this species, which is also much cultivated for its fruit in the countries situated on the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nShi king, 231 [\"Life in Pin\"]:\u2014In the eighth month they knock down the dates (tsao).\n\nHia Calendar, 93:\u2014Eighth month.

So called from the resemblance of the fruit to sheep's dirt. [Compare the Rh ya, 277.]\n\n292.\u2014Mencius said:\u2014Here is a plantation-keeper who neglects his ru [Sterculia, v. infra, 516] and his kia [v. 292, 508] and cultivates his sour wild dates; he is a poor plantation-keeper.\n\nWhat Legge translates by \"sour wild dates\" is \u67b3\u6907 rh ki in the text. The first character is explained in the Rh ya [275] by suan tsao (sour jujube); regarding ki, see the next.\n\nThe \u9178\u68d7 suan tsao at Peking is the wild, spinous form of Zizyphus vulgaris, which in its cultivated state is an unarmed tree with a large oblong spheroidal fruit, containing an oblong pointed stone. The wild form is a very thorny shrub which produces small globular, sour, edible fruits, with a globular stone. It is very like the Z. lotus of Northern Africa. It is very common in the Peking plain and in the mountains. The natives use it for fences. Bunge says regarding this shrub \"spinosissima et molestissima.\"\n\nV. supra, 272. Jap., 2402.\n\nH., 498, Suan tsao, Diospyros Lotus, L., which is Jap., 810, \u541b\u9023\u5b50. H., 426, gives still another (local) Chinese name for this tree.\nThis character, coupled in Mencius with the name of the thorny jujube [see the preceding], has, as Legge states, properly the meaning \"thorns.\" But in the Chou li and in the Shi king, where it frequently occurs, it denotes, according to the ancient commentators, a jujube tree. Mao explains it by tsao (jujube); the Shuo wen says the ki is a small jujube which grows in a bushy manner. It would seem that the aforesaid spiny variety of the jujube is meant. The Ku kin chu [4th century] states that the fruit of the ki is called tsao.\n\nShi king, 50:\u2014The genial wind from the south blows on the heart of that jujube tree (ki). 166:\u2014Of the jujube tree (ki) in the garden the fruits may be used as food. 183:\u2014The wild geese settle on the bushy jujube tree (ki). 186:\u2014The dolichos grows covering the jujube tree (ki). 198:\u2014Yellow birds on jujube trees. 210:\u2014At the gate there are jujube trees. 223, 276, 394:\u2014Jujube trees. 353:\u2014Spoons of thornwood.\n\nThe ki is frequently mentioned in the Shan hai king.\n\nTso chuan, 463:\u2014[B.C. 558.] Woo li, clothed with rushes, forced his way through briars and thorns, \u8346\u68d8. The first character denotes Vitex [v. infra, 521].\n\nWe read in the Chou li [II, 347, 348] that in the outer court of audience there were planted nine \u8346 ki trees, and under them the different ministers of the court had their places. [See quotation in 546.]\n\nLi ki, I, 236:\u2014The Grand Minister of Crime heard the report of the judgment given in the outer court under the Zizyphus tree \u8346\u6728\u4e0b. This phrase indicates that a tree is meant, not a shrub. II, 400:\u2014The game of pitch-pot, played anciently, a kind of archery, with darts instead of arrows and the hand instead of a bow. It is there said:\u2014The arrows are made of mulberry wood [see 501] or from the Zizyphus (ki), without the bark being removed.\nThe \u8a69\u8a71, quoted in K.D., says regarding the \u679c:\u2014It resembles the tsa\u00f6 (jujube), but is very thorny. Its wood is hard and of a red colour. As a shrub it forms thickets, and the people use it for fences. After many years the shrub loses its thorns, and then may attain the height of a ts\u00f6 tree. There is a variety of the ki, the wood of which is white. This is called \u767d\u679c pai ki. Another variety, which produces sour fruits, is called \u6912\u679c rh ki or suan tsa\u00f6 [v. supra, 484].\n\nFrom the above account we may conclude that the ki of the Classics was a jujube.\n\nP., XXXVI, 24, suan tsa\u00f6 or ki; ib'dem, 26, \u767d\u679c pai ki.

[457] says:\u2014It comes nearer the generic term for oranges than any other word.\n\nShu king, 108 [Tribute of Yu]:\u2014Province of Yang chou (Chekiang, Anhui, Kiangsi). Small oranges (ku) and pumeloes [yu, see the next] produced there. K'ung An-k'o explains:\u2014The small sort is ku, the large is yu.\n\nChou li, II, 460:\u2014See the quotation infra, 488. II, 581:\u2014Ouvriers des arcs. L'oranger \u00e0 petites oranges (ku) employ\u00e9 pour faire le corps de l'arc [see the quotation in 501, note].\n\nThe ku is repeatedly mentioned in the Shan hai king.\n\nThe Shuo wen says the ku is a fruit of Kiangnan (Kiangsi) furnished by an evergreen tree.\n\nWilliams says that \u6a58\u5b50 ku ts\u00f6 is a large bitterish orange or bigarade common in the north. I have seen this; it is cultivated at Peking in pots, and is the bitter orange. But the fruit brought to Peking from the southern provinces\nunder the name of ku resembles much the common sweet orange of Southern Europe. [Compare P., XXX, 25, under ka, and Ch., XXXII, 5.]\n\nThe Chinese have also other peculiar characters to designate various sorts of oranges. The \u6a58 ch'eng, likewise brought to Peking from the South, especially from Fuchou in Fukien, is an excellent orange, generally of large size, with a thin rind adhering closely to the pulp. The lobes of the pulp (carpels) do not separate. Europeans call this the coolie-orange, while the name of mandarin-orange or loose-jacket is applied to the smaller, sweet orange. Its skin when ripe is of a cinnabar red colour and adheres to the pulp by a few loose fibres. The lobes separate easily. At Peking it is called \u7d05\u6a58 hung ku or \u706b\u6a58 huo ku (red or fire orange), but its book name is \u67d1 kan, a character derived from\u7518 kan, sweet. P. says it is very sweet and is produced especially in the Southern Provinces. This is the Citrus nobilis of LOUREIRO. LOUREIRO [Flora cochin., 569] is mistaken, it seems, with respect to the Chinese names of the oranges, for he states that C. nobilis in Chinese is tsem can, and C. aurantium, can xu.\n\nSee regarding ch'eng and kan, P., XXX, 34 and 32.

Kuo P'o explains that it resembles the k\u016b (orange), but the fruit is large, sour, has a thick rind.\n\nThe same tree is noticed by the philosopher Lie tsz' [5th century B.C.] as an evergreen tree in the kingdoms of \u5433 Wu and \u695a Ch'u (Chekiang and Hukuang), which bears a red, sour fruit. The ancient dictionary Chen yun says that this character yu is the same as \u67da.\n\nJap., 610, Citrus decumana, L., \u6731\u6b12.\n\n488.\u2014\u67b3 Chi.

The character occurs there also coupled with \u67b3 thorns. Kuo P'o explains that it has thorns, which inflict wounds. The Shuo wen says the chi resembles the k\u0101n (orange).\n\nP., XXXVI, 13, \u67b3\u5be6 chi fruit. The rind of this fruit is used as a medicine and called \u67b3\u6bbc chi k'io. The ancient authors describe this plant as a very thorny shrub with fruits resembling the orange, but smaller and bitter. Ch., XXXIII, 44, rude drawing; small globular fruit; thorns. I suspect this is the Citrus fusca of Loureiro [Flora cochin., 571].

This is, according to Franchet, the Citrus trifoliata, L., (Pseudaegele sepiaria, Miq.). Hemsley [in the Index Flora sin., iii] says that it is the same as Egle sepiaria, DC.\n\nFranchet does not identify the plant represented in the Phon zo [LXXXVII, 6] under \u67b3, but he refers the Citrus trifoliata to the drawing [fol. 8] under \u67b3\u6a58. Siebold [Icon. ined., II], same Chinese name, Egle sepiaria. Siebold [Syn. plant. \u00e6con. jap., 307] Egle sepiaria, \u81ed\u6a58, gedsu. Omniun sane fruticum ad sepas vivas aptissimum.\nIt seems that in Japan the above three Chinese names are all applied to the same plant, *Egle sepiaria* or *Citrus trifoliata*. But the Chinese authors keep the latter two names apart for a plant distinct from the *chi*.\n\n*P.*, XXXVI, 20, \u67b8\u6a58 *kou ku*, also \u81ed\u6a58 *ch'ou ku* (stinking orange). The Chinese authors say that it is a very common shrub, resembling the orange tree. It is very thorny. The flowers are white, not fragrant. The fruit is globular, resembles that of the \u67b3 *chi*, but the rind is thinner, not fragrant. The people plant this shrub to form hedges.\n\n*Ch.* [XXXV, 61] figures under *kou ku* an *Aurantiacea* with long spines, large flowers and fruit of the size of a walnut. The *Ku Lu* (a treatise on oranges, of the 12th century) states that the *kou ku* is much cultivated for hedges, and that its fruit is used as a medicine like that of the *chi*.\n\nOne of the two *Aurantiacea* noticed by the Chinese authors under the names of *chi* and *kou ku* as distinct plants may perhaps be the *Triphasia trifoliata*, DC., (*Tr. aurantiola*, LOCHERIO, 189), a thorny bush indigenous to China as well as to Japan and cultivated at Kew [*Gardu.

The *Shuo wen* says the kou is a tree (of the fruit) of which a sauce is made. It grows in Shu (Szechuan).\n\nLu ki:\u2014The kou is a mountain tree. It resembles the \u679c lu (*Eriobotrya*). It is also called \u6842\u9aa8 kou ku, is of the size of the white poplar. The wood is white and veined; boxes can be made of it. The branches are crooked. The fruits are some inches long, like a finger, seated at the extremities of the branches; they are of a pleasant, sweet taste and ripen in the 8th or 9th month; the best are found in Kiangnau. This tree is now planted in the government\ngarden [\u4eca\u5b98\u5712\u7a2e. Legge translates:\u2014Wealthy men are fond of planting it in the gardens.

They call it \u6728\u871c nu mi or tree honey, also \u67b3\u6907 chi kou.\n\nHovenia dulcis may be intended in the above vague description. In P., nu mi and chi kou are given as names for this tree.

The Chinese authors quoted [7th and 9th centuries] say that the ying yu resembles the \u8461\u8404 p'u t'ao or common grape, but the berries are smaller. They are of a sour and sweet taste and are also called \u91ce\u8461\u8404 ye p'u t'ao, wild grape.\n\nThere are in the Peking mountains two kinds of wild grape with edible black berries of a sweet taste and the size of black currants, the Vitis labrusca, L., var. ficifolia, Bge., and the V. bryoniifolia, Bge. Both these vines are called ye p'u t'ao by the natives.\n\nCompare under the above names the drawings Ch., XXXII, 3, and Kin huang, LVIII, 12.\n\nSiebold, Syn. plant. accon. jap., 241:-Vitis flexuosa, Thbg. nobudoo, \u8461\u8404.

Legge says that ch'ang ch'un is the Carambola tree.\n\n217.\u2014In the low, wet grounds is the carambola tree; soft and pliant are its branches.\n\nThis plant is mentioned in the *Rh ya* [198]. Kuo P'o says it is the \u7f8a\u6843 yang t'ao (goat's peach). The same is said in the *Shuo wen*.\n\nLu ki:\u2014The ch'ang ch'un is now called yong t'ao. Its leaves are long and narrow, its flowers of a purplish red, and its branches so weak, that when they are more than a foot long, they go creeping along on the grass. The people remove the rind of the stem near the root, after placing it in hot ashes, and make pencil-tubes of it.\n\nA notice of the same plant is found in *P.*, XVIIIb, 37, under the head of \u7f8a\u6843 yang t'ao, which is identified there with the ch'ang ch'un of the *Shi king* and the *Rh ya*. The name yang t'ao is from the *Pen ts'ao king*. Lu Shih-ch'en describes it as a plant with a weak creeping stem of the thickness of a finger, large leaves like the palm of the hand, white (downy) on the under side, resembling those of the *Buhmeria* but roundish. The branches when steeped in water become viscid. Ch. [XXII, 42, 43] under the name of yang t'ao, figures two quite different herbaceous plants; bad drawings.\n\nThe yang t'ao of *P.* is certainly not *Arerhoo Carambola*, and the ancient commentators have also not meant to identify the ch'ang ch'un of the Classics with the Carambola, a tropical tree, which succeeds well in the southern provinces of China, but was hardly even known in the north. Williams [Dict., 28] and Legge have been misled by the name yang t'ao, which at Canton is applied\nto the *Carambola*, or Chinese gooseberry as it is called by Europeans.27\n\nI may observe that the name *yang t'ao* is also applied in China to *Actinidia chinensis*, Pl., a climbing shrub with edible fruit about the size of a plum. [See HENRY, l.c., 544]. It is well figured in *Ch*. [XXXI, 21], where the names *yang t'ao* and \u7334\u6843 *mi hon t'ou* (monkey's peach) are given.

This character was originally written \u6817. The Shuo wen explains that it is intended to represent the fruits hanging down. The Chinese chestnut is the same as that cultivated in Europe, *Castanea vulgaris*, Lam. It is grown throughout the empire. It is frequently mentioned in the Classics.\n\n*Shi king*, 177, 190:\u2014In the low, wet grounds are the chestnuts. 358:\u2014On the mountain are the chestnut trees. 237:\u2014The bitter gourds hanging from the branches of the chestnut tree. 81:\u2014Duke Wun [7th century B.C.] built the mansion at Ts'oo (\u695a). He planted about it hazel (\u699b) and chestnut trees and other trees.\n\n---\n\n27 The first Chinese author who mentions the *Carambola* and describes it quite correctly is KI HAN, in the *Nan fang ts'ao mu chuang* [3rd century. See Botan. sin., I, 38]. It is there termed \u4e94\u89d2\u5b50 *wu lien ts'i*, which, as the author explains, means five ridges and refers to the shape of the fruit, which is said to be very acid. LI SHU-CHEN [in P., XXXI, 10] likewise gives a good description of the *Carambola* fruit under the above name, and adds that in Min (Fukien) it is called \u7334\u6843 *yang t'ao*. He compares the shape of the fruit with a stone roller used by Chinese farmers for rolling down the fields when sown. A good drawing of the *Carambola* *Ch.*, XXXI, 45, *wu lien*. [See also Phon zo, LXVII, 14.]\nPLANTS MENTIONED IN CLASSICAL WORKS.\n\nConf. Analects, 26:\u2014Altars of the spirits of the land (\u793e). The Hia [dynasty, B.C. 2205-1766] used the pine tree (\u677e), the Yin [B.C. 1766-1122] used the cypress (\u67cf), and the men of the Chou [B.C. 1122-249] the chestnut.\n\nThe commentary says:\u2014These trees were planted by the founders of the several dynasties about the altars of the spirits of the land (\u571f\u5730\u795e).\n\nWe read in the Chou li [I, 193]:\u2014Le grand directeur des multitudes (\u5927\u53f8\u5f92) dispose les murs de l'enceinte consacr\u00e9e au g\u00e9nie de la terre et \u00e0 celui des c\u00e9r\u00e9ales.

Kuo P'o explains:\u2014Small chestnuts.\n\nThe character lie occurs in the *Shi king* [450].

Leaves like those of the elm. Veined, strong, pliable wood, of a red colour, fit for making thills of carriages.\n\nThe Chinese tree which bears the small chestnut is figured in Ch. [XXXII, 16] under \u8305\u6817 mao li, and is also noticed in P. at the end of the article li, the common chestnut. The mao li is likewise spoken of by Lu ki as producing the small chestnut.\n\nCl. Abel, in 1816, saw small chestnuts exposed for sale near the Poyang lake. They were not larger than the common bon nut [Journey in the Interior of China, 165, 166]. Fortune [Res. am. Chin., 51, 144] met with this small chestnut in the hills near Ningpo. He says:\u2014It is a delicious little kind, bearing fruit about the size and form of our common hazel-nut. This was introduced into England and India [Gardn. Chron., 1860, 170]. Father David notices small chestnuts, of the size of cherries, produced on dwarf trees near Kinkiang [Nouv. Arch. Mus. hist. nat., VIII, 33]. [Compare also Henry, l.c., 227.]\n\nThe same small chestnuts are also produced in Japan. See Gardn. Chron., 1875, 270, Japanese Edibles exhibited at London, 1873.

Kuo P'o explains:\u2014The fruit resembles the chestnut, but is smaller; it has a pleasant taste.\n\nLu ki:\u2014The chen is a sort of li (chestnut). There are two kinds. One of these trees in its bark and leaves resembles the chestnut. It bears a small fruit resembling that of the \u67ab chu [see the Rh ya, 239, an oak]; it tastes like the chestnut. This is called the chen li (hazel-chestnut). The other kind (a shrub) has branches and leaves like the \u6728\u84fc mu liao [an oak, v. infra, 534]; it grows about 10 feet high. The fruit resembles in taste the walnut (hu t'ao). This kind, which is the true chen or hazel-nut, abounds in the mountains of Liaotung (Southern Manchuria) and \u4e0a\u9ee8 Shang tang (South-eastern Shansi). The fruit resembles that of the \u699b siang (an oak, v. infra, 534). The branches are fit for torches.\nLu ki's account of the hazel is vague and not characteristic. Li Shi-chen [in P., XXX, 50, under chen] gives a better description of it. By the drawing under chen, Ch., XXXI, 4, evidently the hazel is intended.\n\nThe mountains of Northern China abound in hazels. The nuts are called chen tsz. There are two species. The nuts of both are edible and sold in the markets. The fruit of Corylus heterophylla, Fisch, with its spreading involucre, resembles that of our common C. avellana. But in the other species, the C. mandshurica, Maxim. (which by some is considered as a variety of the American C. rostrata, Ait.), the campanulate involucre is longer than the nut; it covers not only the whole nut but is contracted beyond the apex of the nut into a long rostrum. The whole involucre is covered with stinging bristles.\n\nBoth these species occur also in Japan.*\n\nAmeen, erot., 816, \u699b sin, vulgo jasi basibami, ja.

This character is met with three times in the Shi. Legge translates it by pepper plant.\n\nShi king, 179:\u2014The clusters of the pepper plant (tsiao) large and luxuriant, would fill both your hands . . . O the pepper plant, how its shoots (\u689d rather branches) extend! 207:\u2014Give me a stalk of the pepper plant. 603:\u2014Pepper-like smell. Mao explains tsiao by \u82b3\u9999 (fragrance). Another ancient commentator says that the tsiao was used in flavoring wine.\nSee the *Rh ya*, 259, *ta tsiao*. The *tsiao* is repeatedly mentioned in the *Shan hai king*. Kuo P'o explains:\u2014A small tree, injurious to wood-worms. The *Shan hai king* mentions also the \u79e6\u6912 *Ts'in tsiao* and as an herbaceous plant. *Li sao* 6, 50:\u2014\u7533\u6912 *shen tsiao*. Poivrier du pays de Chen (Southern Honan). 19:\u2014Monticules plant\u00e9s de poivriers. 56, 58:\u2014Poivrier.\n\n**Lu ki:**\u2014The *tsiao* tree resembles the \u8336\u82f1 *chu yu* [see the next]. It is provided with spines. Its leaves are hard, shining. The people of Shu (Szechuan) call it \u8336 *tu*, the people of Wu (Chekiang, Kiang-si) term it \u8336 *ming*. Of the leaves they prepare, by boiling them, a fragrant substance. There are several kinds of *tsiao*. One of them, which grows in the mountains of \u6210\u7687 *Ch'eng kao* (Department of K'ai-feng fu, in Honan) has leaves resembling those of the bamboo. This tree is like the \u85af\u6912 *shu tsiao*. It (the fruit or the leaves) is somewhat poisonous and not used in medicine. The *tsiao* enters into the preparation of beverages and meats; fowl and sucking-pig are seasoned with it. On the islands of the Eastern Sea there is a kind of *tsiao* tree the fruit of which is not round but elongate, very fragrant, with a taste like orange-peel. The flesh of deer, when they eat the leaves of this tree, becomes fragrant.\n\n*Tsiao* is nowadays a general term for fruits with an aromatic, hot and pungent taste. \u8fa3\u6912 *la tsiao* is cayenne pepper or chillies, \u80e1\u6912 *hu tsiao* is the common pepper, *Piper nigrum*, and \u82b1\u6912 *hua tsiao* the fruit of *Zanthoxylon*, Chinese pepper. As chillies and common pepper were unknown to the Chinese in the classical period, the term *tsiao* in the *Shi king* can only be referred to *Zanthoxylon*, of which more than a dozen species are known in China.\n\n---\n\nThis seems to be a mistake. *Tu* and *ming* are ancient terms for the tea-leaf. [See the *Rh ya*, 307.]\ntree which in Northern China furnishes the Chinese pepper is the *Zanthoxylon Bungei*, Planch., a tree of middle size, very spiny, bearing in autumn dense clusters of small red berry-like capsules of an aromatic, pungent taste; the leaves are likewise fragrant. This tree grows wild in the mountains and is also much cultivated. It is called \u82b1\u6912 hua tsiao in the popular language, but its original name is \u79e6\u6912 Ts'in tsiao. This name is found in the *Pen ts'ao king* and is derived from the mountain range of Ts'in-ling which divides the valleys of the rivers Han and Wei in Southern Shensi. This is most probably the pepper of the Classics, although there are, it seems, several species of *Zanthoxylon* in different parts of China, which yield this spice. Several kinds of pepper trees are described in *P.*, XXXII, 1\u20138, and figured in *Ch.*, XXXIII, 40, 41.

The character translated by pepper is \u83dc i. Cheng Huan and the Shuo wen explain it by \u714e\u83dc\u8438 (fried chu yu).\n\nThe Shuo wen says the chu yu is a kind of tsiao (*Zanthoxylon*). [See also the Rh ya, 329.] There are three different plants to which the name chu yu is applied.\nThe \u98df\u8331\u8438 shi chu yu (edible chu yu) is described in P. [XXXII, 19] as a lofty thorny tree resembling the \u6a80 ch'iu [Ailantus, v. infra, 518]. Branches with white spots, yellow flowers, aromatic, pungent fruits, used in Kiangsu to season meat. The Kuang ya calls it \u8d8a\u6912 yue tsiao [Yue = north-east of Chekiang]. According to T'ao Hung-king [5th century], this is the i mentioned in the Li ki, and the \u6912\u6912 tsiao sha of the Rh ya [329].\n\nThe sha is mentioned in the Li sao [57]:\u2014La plante cha (\u6912) qui ne venille que le sachet lui soit ouvert. D'Hervey says:\u2014La plante cha est la m\u00eame que celle qu'on nomme aujourd'hui chou yu. Ce serait alors une sorte de Sanguinaria d'une assez grande esp\u00e8ce. But the sha is Boymia or Zanthoxylon.\n\nAccording to Hoffm. & Schultes [632] \u98df\u8331\u8438 or \u8d8a\u6912 is Zanthoxylon ailanthoides, S. & Z. In the Kwa wi [116] both the above Chinese names are applied to the same species, described there as a tall tree with yellowish white flowers [compare the above description in P.]. See also the drawing under the same Chinese names in the Phon zo [LXX, 12, 13] which seems rather to refer to a Rhus.\n\nThe \u5434\u8331\u8438 Wu chu yu or chu yu of Wu (Chekiang, Kiangsi) is noticed in P. [XXXII, 13] as a drug, the aerial fruit of a tree, resembling the tsiao fruit (Zanthoxylon). Rude drawing under the above name in Ch. [XXXIII, 37]. The drug Wu chu yu, obtained from an apothecary's shop at Peking, proved to consist of the fruits of Boymia (Evodia) rutaearpa, described and depicted in Siebold & Zucc., Flora japon., I, 50, tab. 21, and Siebold, Icon. ined., II, under \u5434\u8331\u8438. [Compare also Henry, l.c., 96, 212.] Same Chinese name of this plant in Hupei. Siebold says that this tree has been introduced from China into Japan, where its fruit is much esteemed as a medicine.

In Japan the above Chinese name is applied to the fruit of *Cornus officinalis*; Siebold & Zucc. *Flora japonica*, I, 100, tab. 50; Siebold, *Icon. ined.*, IV; Phon zo, LXXXVII, 15, 16. *Cornus officinalis* has not hitherto been collected in China proper, but Siebold states that it is a Chinese plant.

Yu made the mulberry grounds (\u6851\u571f) fit for silk-worms.\n\nMencius, 336, 337:\u2014Wen wang (the founder of the Chou dynasty, 12th century B.C.) planted around the homestead, the space beneath the walls, with mulberry trees, with which the women nourished silk-worms, and thus the old men were able to have silk to wear.\n\nShi king, 82:\u2014The duke of Wan [7th century B.C.] surveyed Ts'iu and T'ang, with the high hills. He descended and examined the mulberry trees [to see whether the ground was well adapted for their growth]. 126:\u2014Do not break my mulberry trees. 184:\u2014The wild geese rest on the bushy mulberry trees. 191:\u2014On the hillsides are mulberry trees. 199:\u2014The yellow birds flit about and rest upon the mulberry trees. 222:\u2014The turtle-dove is in the mulberry tree. 272, 301, 519:\u2014Mulberry tree. 337:\u2014The mulberry tree and the tsz' [c. infra, 508] must be regarded with reverence. 414:\u2014In the low, wet grounds the mulberry trees are beautiful and luxuriant, the leaves are glossy, dark. 417:\u2014They gather firewood of branches of the mulberry tree. 164:\u2014They gather the mulberry leaves. 228 [\"Life in Pin\"]:\u2014With the spring days the warmth begins, and the oriole utters its song.

Ibidem:\u2014In the silk-worm month they strip the mulberry branches of their leaves, and take their axes and hatchets, to lop off those that are distant and high, only stripping the young trees of their leaves.\nWhat Legge translates by young trees is in the Chinese text \u5973\u6851 n\u00fc sang, female (women's) mulberry. The commentary says a small mulberry. [See the Rh ya, 303.]\n\n99:\u2014Before the mulberry tree has shed its leaves, how rich and glossy are they! Ah! thou dove, eat not its fruit. When the mulberry tree sheds its leaves, they fall yellow on the ground. \u8461 shen in the text. Mao explains it by \u6851\u5be6 (mulberry fruit). [See the Rh ya, 302]. The character is also written \u6851 and \u7d20, as in the Shi king [620].\n\n236:\u2014Creeping about were the caterpillars, all over the mulberry grounds. 234:\u2014I gathered the roots of the mulberry tree, \u6851\u571f. The commentary explains that the root of the tree is meant. The white rind of the root of the mulberry tree is still used as a medicine.\n\nThe mulberry tree is cultivated in all the provinces of China. The principal object of its culture is the leaf on which the silk-worm feeds. Silk is raised wherever the tree grows. The cultivation of the mulberry tree and the breeding of silk-worms for the manufacture of silk can be traced back to the remotest time of Chinese civilisation. According to an ancient tradition related in Huai nan wang's treatise on the rearing of silk-worms [first century B.C.], \u897f\u9675 Shiling, Empress of Huang ti [B.C. 2697] first taught the people the art of rearing the silk-worm. She was consequently deified and worshipped.\n\nThe mulberry trees cultivated in China for the breeding of silk-worms are all varieties of Morus alba, L., as also the trees grown in Western Asia and Southern Europe for the same purposes. M. nigra, a native of Western Asia, and much cultivated there for its excellent dark red fruit, is not fit for rearing silk-worms. The name M. alba was given to the silk-worm mulberry by C. Bauhin [Pinax theatri bot., 459] on account of its white fruit. But in China (at Peking at least) the fruit of M. alba is generally of a\nred colour. I have seldom seen white berries there. The Chinese eat the fruit, but it is insipid.\n\nBureau in De Candolle's Prodromus [XVII, 242] suggests that *M. alba* var. *mongolica*, first discovered by Father David in the mountains of Southern Mongolia, may be the original wild type of the white mulberry. This variety, very common in the mountains of Northern China, is characterised by its leaves being very irregular in shape: they are always lobed, from three to five lobes, the margin of which is provided with long cuspidate teeth; the berries are dark red, nearly black. According to the late Dr. Hance [Journ. Botan., 1875, 135] the mulberry cultivated in the south has invariably undivided leaves; but the cultivated trees in the neighbourhood of Peking have habitually lobed leaves. The Peking cultivated mulberry trees belong to the variety *latifolia*, which name Bureau applies to the *Morus alba* most generally cultivated in South and Middle China, and which has also been named *M. multicanis*. Other varieties of *M. alba* recorded in China are, according to Bureau, *v. nigriformis*, Macao (Callery), *v. indica*, Canton (Hedde), Formosa (Oldham), *v. atropurpurea* (*M. rubra*, Lour.).\n\nP., XXXVI; \u7d2b\u6851. The mulberry tree is well figured in Ch. [XXXIII, 34]. \u845b\u8513, LV1, 16. rude drawing.\n\nIn Japan, where sericulture is also highly developed, the same broad-leaved variety of *M. alba* is extensively cultivated for the same purposes. [See Miquel, Prol. Flora japon., 130]; Franchet & Savatier Enum. Plant. Japon. [I, 432]. The rearing of silk-worms in Japan, according to the Japanese annals, dates from the 3rd or 4th century. [See N. Rondot's excellent work Les Soies, 1885, I, 272. Siebold [Syn. plant. \u00e6con. jap., 161] states that the mulberry tree was introduced into Japan from China.\n\nAmoen. exot., 783:\u2014\u6851 soo, vulgo kuwa. Morus fructu albo.

Its globular fruit resembles the mulberry. The seeds look like those of Zanthoxylon. According to the Ku kin chu the fruit of the che tree is called chui. Birds are very fond of it.

Its leaves do not fall off in winter. It grows in the wild mountainous country of Kiangnan (present Kiangsi). Li Shih-chen says, this tree resembles the che, but is provided with thorns, and smaller. Its leaves, which resemble those of the \u6851 tso (an oak, c. infra, 534), but are smaller, are used for feeding silk-worms.\n\nSee in Ch., XXXV, 46 and 27, figures representing these two trees; also Kin hsiang, LV1, 5; rude drawing.\n\nThe che tree of the Chinese is now well-known to our botanists. It is the Cudrania triloba of the order Arctocarpae, to which belongs also the mulberry tree. It was first described by Dr. Hance in 1868. [See Hooker, Icon. plant., VIII, 1887, tab. 1792.] It has been gathered in various parts of China by Debeaux, Forbes, David, Henry. F. B. Forbes writes [in the Journ. Bot., 1883, 145] that the tree varies much in habit, being found often with thorns and as often without them. The typical form of the leaves is distinctly 3-lobed. [See also Henry, l.c., 19.]\n\nI cannot say what the drawing in the Phon zo [LXXXVII, 1] under \u5974\u6822 is intended for. Franchet & Savatier [l.c., I, 434] mention the Cudrania japonensis, Tr\u00e9ve., in Japan. It is represented in the Phon zo [l.c., 5] but under the same Chinese name as the Bronsonia [c. infra, 503].\n\nE., 248, family \u6822, with recognizable figure of Cudrania.\n\nKan [502] is a synonym.\n\nJap., 715, Cudrania triloba, Hce., \u5974\u6822.\n\n502.\u2014\u5e79 Kan, also written \u5e79.

Tribute of Y\u00fc] the kan is mentioned together with other trees as produced in the province of \u8346\u5dde King chou (Hukuang). Legge translates, wood for\nbows.

According to Siebold & Zuccarini [*Flora japon.*, II, 58, 35] this is *Juniperus chinensis*, L.\n\nIn the *Phon zo* [LXXVIII, 2] *J. chinensis* is figured under the Chinese names \u6a9c, \u523a\u67cf and \u6854\u5b50\u677e.\n\nUnder the names \u523a\u67cf ts'z' po [H., 355] aeicular *Thuja*, and \u523a\u677e ts'z' sung, aeicular pine, *Ch.* [XXXIII, 3] figures a *Juniperus*, probably *J. chinensis*, for ts'z' sung at Peking is the popular name of this tree.\n\nThe \u67cf kuai is generally considered by the ancient writers to be the same as the *kui* [see the *Kuang yun Dictionary* and *Rh ya i*]. The *Shuo wen* states that the wood of the *kuai* is used to scorch the tortoise-shell for use in divination.\n\n*Shu king*, 115 [Tribute of Y\u00fc]:\u2014The *kuai* mentioned as growing in the Province of King chou (Hukuang). K'ung Ying-ta says the *kuai* is the same as the *kui*, and Legge translates it by cedar.\nIt seems to me that the *kuai* as well as the *kuai* must be referred to *Juniperus chinensis*, L., a tall, very common tree in the Northern Provinces of China. It is remarkable for the dimorphism of its leaves. They resemble generally those of *J. Sabina* or of the common cypress, i.e. they are scale-like and closely appressed. But frequently one or more branches on the same tree show spreading acicular leaves, as in *J. communis*. Sometimes the whole tree has only acicular leaves. These are probably the trees to which the name *kuai* was applied. See above Li Shi-Chen's account of the *kuai*, which, however, is not quite correct if he has in view the juniper, the galbuli of which are not dehiscent.

Then there is a coffin of \u6850 i wood [v. infra, 548] and two of the Rottlera (tsz'). The four are all complete enclosures. The shell of the coffin is of cypress wood.\n\nChou li, II, 462:\u2014Travail des bois de prix (\u6893). Commentator B.

Kuo P'o says same as \u6850 ts'iu. But in explaining the Shan hai king, where the tsz' is repeatedly mentioned, Kuo P'o says it is the shan ts'iu or mountain ts'iu.\n\nAccording to the Shuo wen, \u6850 is the same as \u6850 and also the same as \u6a80 kia.\n\nLu ki:\u2014The tsz' is a variety of the ts'iu with a white coarsely veined wood, and which bears fruit. Another variety which has the fruit of the tsz' and the rind of the tu'ng [v. infra, 515, Paulownia] is called \u6850 i [c. 509].\n\nThe T'si min yao shu [5th century] states that the variety with a white bark, and with fruits resembling horns, is called \u6850 tsz' or \u89d2 \u6a80 kio ts'iu, horned ts'iu. Other ancient authors describe these horns (capsules) as more than a foot\nlong, and slender; after the leaves have fallen off, the fruit still hangs on the tree. Compare with this David, Troisi\u00e8me Voyage dans l'Empire chinois, I, 247:\u2014J'observe sur les bords du torrent des Catalpa qui conservent encore leurs nombreuses gousses, longues et minces, qui font un effet curieux sur ces arbres \u00e9pinill\u00e9s [25th January, 1873, Southern Shensi].\n\nThe Pi ya [11th century] says:\u2014In the same way as the \u7261\u4e39 moutan (Pononia moutan) is called \u82b1\u738b hua wang, (the king of flowers) the tsz' is termed \u6728\u738b mu wang (the king of trees) for there is no other wood which is superior to the wood of the tsz'.\n\nThe Rh ya i [12th century] says:\u2014The tsz' yields a valuable timber for house-building. A house built of it is never struck by lightning.\n\nP., XXXVa, 20, \u6893 tsz'. Su Sung [11th century] says:\u2014The wood of the tsz' yields a valuable timber much used for building palaces, temples and houses. It is largely cultivated in gardens. Li Shi-chen states:\u2014This tree is very common. There are three varieties of it. That with a white veined wood is the tsz', that with a red wood is \u6a1f ts'iu, that with a beautifully veined wood is \u6a80 i. A smaller variety of the ts'iu is called \u6a80 kia. [Compare also the Rh ya, 290-292.] These names are frequently confounded by Chinese, and it seems also by Japanese, botanists.\n\nThe Shan hai king mentions n tree, \u6a80 sian, which, according to Kuo P'o, is the same as the ts'iu. [See W.D., 794.]\n\nCh. [XXXIII, 47, under \u6a80] gives a good drawing of Catalpa Bungeana, C. A. Meyer, with flowers and fruits. This beautiful tree is known at Peking under the name of ts'iu. It attains considerable dimensions. Its leaves are very variable in size, heart-shaped or triangular, entire or lobed; they have an unpleasant smell. In May the tree is covered with a profusion of large bell-shaped flowers, white\nwith purple spots. The capsules are long and slender. A rude picture of the ts'iu, only leaves, is found in the Kiu huang [LVI, 11]. Henry, l.c., 78, ts'iu in Hupei is the Catalpa Kampferi.\n\nAmara, c.e., 841, 842, \u89d2\u6a39 kakusju, vulgo kawara jisagi, detailed description and drawing of Catalpa Kampferi, S. & Z. Siebold, Icon. ined., VI, \u6811 Catalpa Kampferi.\n\nSiebold, Icon. ined., VI, and Flora japon., I, 147, tab. 79, \u6811 Rottlera japonica. Sprengel, Croton japonicum, Thbg. [Flora, japon., 270], Order Euphorbiaceae. The leaves of this shrub, which is found also in China, have some resemblance to the leaves of Catalpa. The fruit is a capsule of the size of a cherry. In the Phon zo [LXXXII, 23, 24] we have \u6811 Catalpa Kampferi, and [24-25] \u6811 Rottlera japonica.\n\nThe ts'iu of the Classics is, I have no doubt, Catalpa, and most probably the character \u679c kia, referred likewise to this tree, has erroneously been identified with \u679c kia.\n\nMencius said:\u2014A plantation-keeper who neglects his ren [Sternlia, c. infra, 516] and kia (\u679c) and cultivates his sour wild dates (jujubes, c. supra, 484) is a poor plantation-keeper.\n\nTso Chuan, 415, 416 [Duke Siang, B.C. 570]:\u2014Mu-keang (Duke Ch'ing's mother) had caused some fine kia trees to be chosen, to make for herself a coffin and a lute. 423 [B.C. 568]:\u2014Ke-sun had planted for himself six kia trees in the Pu orchard outside the east gate. King asked him for some trees [to make the coffin] and when he gave a half-assent the other used the kia trees without Ke-sun's forbidding him. 833 [Duke Gae, 493-467 B.C.]:\u2014Tsz-sen, when about to die, said:\u2014Plant kia trees by my grave. [The kia furnished wood for coffins.]\n\nIn all the above quotations, kia is \u679c in the modern editions of the Classics, but, as has already been noticed [see supra, 292],\nsome Chinese authors assert that this character was anciently written \u6851. We may therefore suppose that in the ancient editions of the Classics the latter character was used in the above-quoted passages, and that the kia were Catalpa trees.\n\nV. supra, 290, 292.\n\n509.\u2014\u6905 I, also written \u6905. Name of a tree mentioned in the Shi king.\n\n81:\u2014Duke Wan [7th century B.C.] planted around the mansion at Ts'in (\u695a) the i and other trees. 276:\u2014From the t'ung [v. infra, 515, Paulownia] and the i the fruit hangs down.\n\nThe Rh ya [293] makes the i to be the same as the tsz (Catalpa), but the mention of both in the text [81] seems to show that they are different.\n\nLu ki, after having spoken of the tsz, says that the i is a tree which has a fruit like that of the tsz and a bark like the t'ung [v. infra, 515, Paulownia].\n\n510.\u2014\u691a Yu. Shi king, 273:\u2014On the hills of the north is the yu. The Rh ya [260] calls this tree \u9f20\u6893 shu tsz (rat's Catalpa).\n\nLu ki:\u2014It is a sort of ts'iu (Catalpa); it resembles that tree in the leaves and in the texture of the wood. Now the people call it \u82e6\u691a k'u ts'iu (bitter Catalpa). The wood is said to be brittle in wet weather and strong in dry weather. In \u6c38\u660c Yung chung it is known under the name of shu tsz. In the Han time it was termed yu.\n\n511.\u2014\u689d T'iao. This character properly means a branch, a twig, the Shuo wen says a small branch, and in this sense it is used in the Shi king [17]. But t'iao in ancient times had also other meanings. In the Rh ya [236] it denotes the Pumelo; in the Shan hai king an herbaceous plant repeatedly mentioned.\nIn one passage of the *Shi*, *tiao* is, according to the Chinese commentators, the name of a tree. Mao says, the same as the \u6850 *tiao* in the *Rh ya* [223], which is said there to be the \u5c71\u6a3a *shan kia* or, as Kuo P'o explains, the \u5c71\u6a3a *shan ts'iu*. I cannot understand why Medhurst, who is followed by Legge, asserts that this is a kind of fir distinguished by its white bark. None of the Chinese commentators assign to it this meaning.\n\n*Shi king*, 197:\u2014On the Chung nan \u7d42\u5357 mountains (south of the old capital Hao in Shensi) there are white firs (*tiao*).\n\nLu ki:\u2014The *tiao* is the same as the *tiao* in the *Rh ya* and is now called \u5c71\u6a3a *shan ts'iu* (mountain Catalpa). It resembles the *ts'iu* which grows in the plain, but its bark is white, and the leaves are also white (downy). It affords good timber, boards for carts and coffins.\n\nIt is impossible to guess what tree the *shan ts'iu* was. The name *ts'iu* seems to be applied to several trees, the leaves of which resemble those of *Catalpa*. In the *Kiu huang* [LIv, 31] is a rude drawing of the \u523a\u6a3a *ts'z* *ts'iu* or thorny *ts'iu*, represented with palmate leaves and thorns. [See also Ch., XXXIV, 16.] It is described as a large tree provided with large thorns and *Catalpa* leaves. Its rind is greenish white with yellow spots. This is, according to Henry [l.c., 79], the *Acanthopanax ricinifolia*, S. & Z., and the same as the *ts'z* *ts'iu* tree with a five-pronged leaf observed by Parker in Szech'nan [*China Review*, X, 160]. It has the same Chinese name in Japan. [See the *Kwa wi*, 89.] According to this Japanese work it is a tree of large size.\n\nV. supra, 290. Other *Araliaceae* are mentioned:\n\nJap., 13, *Acanthopanax aculeatum*, Seem., \u4e94\u52a0.\n\" 199, *Aralia cordata*, Thbg., \u571f\u7576\u6b78.\n\" 200, \" spinosa, L., \u6a39\u6728.\n\" 941, *Fatsia japonica*, Dce. & Pl., \u91d1\u525b\u8449.\nPLANTS MENTIONED IN CLASSICAL WORKS.\n\nJap., 1067, Hedera Helix, L., \u5e38\u6625\u85e4.\n,, 1074, Helwingia japonica, Dietr., \u9752\u835a\u8449.\n,, 1549, Panax repens, Max., \u571f\u53c2.\n,, 1550, ,, Ginseng, C.

Kuo P'o says:\u2014A large tree commonly called \u6960 nan.\n\nIn the passage of the Shi king [197] where tiao [see 511] is mentioned as growing together with the \u6885 mei in the Chung nan mountains, Lu ki in his commentary takes mei as in this place not meaning the plum tree. He thinks that the Shi has in view the \u6960 nan, of which he gives the following account:\u2014The nan in its bark and leaves resembles the \u6a1f chang [camphor tree, c. infra, 513]. The leaves are as large as an ox-ear, ending in a point and with a red heart. The flowers are of a yellowish red colour, the fruits are green, not eatable. The leaves are clustered three or four together. The wood is more finely veined than that of the yu chang. There are varieties of this tree, one with red fruit, the wood of which is tough. Another kind has white fruit, its wood is easily broken. The people of King chou (Hukwang) report that in the districts of \u65b0\u57ce Sin ch'eng and \u4e0a\u5eb8 Shang yung (which correspond to ancient Chung nan) there are plenty of chang (camphor trees) and nan trees. The Rh ya [227] gives the above character nan as a synonym for mei.\n\nThe nan tree here spoken of (the character is more commonly written \u6960 nan) is a large tree which nowadays is found in the Province of Sz'ech'uan, and affords the highly esteemed nan mu, a tough, incorruptible wood, much used for buildings and furniture.\n\nIt is mentioned by Sz ma Siang ju [c. ing'ra, 514]. Li Shih-ch'en, in P. [XXXIV, 37] describes it as a tree of enormous size growing in the Province of Sz'ech'uan, with fruit resemi-\nbling the \u4e01\u9999 ting hsiang (clove). This interesting tree has been determined by Prof. Oliver of Kew, from specimens received from Szech'nan. It is the Persea naumu of the Laurel order. [See Hooker, Icon. plant., IV, 1880, p. 10, tab. 1316. Henry, l.c., 303.] In Japan, where the Chinese nata mu is not found, the name \u5357\u6728 is applied to another Lauracea, the Machilus Thunbergii, S. & Z. (Laurus indica, Thbg.). [See the Phon zo, LXXXI, 7, 8].\n\nAccording to Index Fl. Sin., Vol. II, p. 376, it is Machilus Naumu, Hemsl.\n\nV. supra, 227. Of Lauracea are mentioned:\n\nJap., 53, Actinodaphne lancifolia, Meisn., \u516d\u99ff.\n\n,, 599, Cinnamomum Camphora, Nees, \u6a1f.\n\n,, 600, ,, Lourciri, Nees, \u6842.\n\n,, 758, Daphnidium strychifolium, S. & Z., \u5929\u53f0\u9ce5\u85e5.\n\n,, 1286, Lindera glauca, Bl., \u5c71\u80e1\u6912.\n\n,, 1289, ,, serrata, Bl., \u920e\u6a1f.\n\n513.\u2014\u50cf\u7ae0 Y\u00fc chang, name of a tree, or more probably of two trees [see further on] which are repeatedly mentioned in the Shan hai king. The second character is there sometimes written \u7ae0 chang, which now is the common name for the camphor tree, Laurus Camphora, L. Kuo P'o explains yu chang by a great tree resembling the ts'iu (Catalpa) and having evergreen leaves; can only be distinguished after seven years [see farther on the meaning of this statement].\n\nW.D. [23] says that Y\u00fc chang is the ancient classic name for the Province of Kiangsi, and that the present name for the camphor tree is derived from it. I may observe that the name Y\u00fc chang in this sense is not met with in the Classics, so far as I know. It appears first in the History of the Earlier Han, in the 2nd century B.C., as the name of a department comprising a great part of present Kiangsi.\n\nBut yu chang for camphor-tree occurs in the Tso chuan [847], referring to the year B.C. 477:\u2014He tore up a large log of a camphor-wood tree, killed a man, and died.\nXXXIV, 38, \u6a80 chang. Ch'en Ts'ang-k'i, an author of the first half of the 8th century, says that the camphor tree is called chang from the district of Yii chang, which abounds in these trees. The yu chang is mentioned by Sz' ma Siang-ju [second century B.C.]. [See quotation in 514]. It appears from the quotations found in K.K.F.P. [LXXII, 12] under yu chang, that in ancient times this term probably referred to the camphor tree. The Shi i ki [4th century] says that the yu chang was used for ship-building. The Shu i ki [6th century] relates that the Emperor Han Wu-ti [B.C. 140-86] built a palace of yu chang wood. But Yen Shih-ku [7th century], quoted in K.D., states that by yu chang properly two trees are to be understood which greatly resemble each other and can only be distinguished when seven years old; the chang is the true camphor tree. The yu is referred in P. [l.e., 39] to another Lauracea, called also \u920e\u6a1f tiao chang (hook camphor tree) and \u9ce5\u6a1f wen chang (black camphor tree). It is supposed that the \u6a80 lun of the Rh ya [248] is this tree.\n\nLaurus camphora is a common tree in Middle and Southern China. It abounds especially in the Province of Kiangsi and in Formosa. It is likewise plentiful in Japan. A good drawing of the tree is found in Ch. [XXXIII, 61].\n\nAmara. erot., 770, \u6a80. Laurus camphorifera, sio vulgo kasnoki.

The commentary says:\u2014Large trees of Southern China. The dictionary Y\u00fc pien\n[6th century] says that the p'ien resemble the yu chang. [See also W.D., 690, and the Rh ya, 248.]\n\n515.\u2014\u6850 T'ung. This tree is frequently mentioned in the Classics. Legge calls it erroneously Elaeococca, Dryandra.\n\nShu king, 81:\u2014Duke Wan [7th century B.C.] planted the t'ung together with other trees about the mansion at \u695a Ts'un. They furnished materials for lutes. A commentator says that the best lutes are those of which the upper part is made of t'ung wood, and the bottom of that of the tse' (Catalpa, v. supra, 508). 276:\u2014From the t'ung and the i [509] the fruit hangs down.\n\nShu king, 104 [Tribute of Y\u00fc]:\u2014Province of \u5f90\u5dde S\u016b chou (Northern Kiangsu and Anhui).

The older and loftier the tree, the better for the purpose. A solitary tree on the hill side or top, having outlived all its compeers, would possess a special value.\n\nMencius, 291:\u2014[See the quotation in 508.]\n\nHia Calendar, 49:\u2014Third month. \u6850\u6850\u82ad.

Kuo P'o refers this erroneously to wu t'ung (Sterculia). Not this but the tree mentioned in the Rh ya [283] is wu t'ung.\n\nLu ki:\u2014There are many sorts of t'ung; the \u9752\u6850 ts'ing t'ung (green t'ung), the \u767d\u6850 pai or white t'ung, the \u8d64\u6850 ch'i or red t'ung, the \u68a7\u6850 wu t'ung. The wood of the white\nis good for making lutes. Now the people of Tsang ko (a part of Sz'ch'uan, Kuichou, etc) and Y\u00fcan nan spin thread from a t'ung tree and make a kind of cloth which resembles woollen cloth. [This refers to Sterculia, v. infra, 516.]\n\nP., XXXVa, 23, \u6850 t'ung also \u767d\u6850 white t'ung or \u6ce1\u6850 pao t'ung. Li Shih-ch'en, who correctly refers the Rh ya [309] to this, gives the following description of the t'ung tree:\u2014It has very large leaves, variable in shape. Its rind is of a dirty white colour. Its wood is light, never injured by insects. It is used in making various utensils, and is also excellent for pillars in building houses. It opens its flowers in the second month; they resemble the flowers of the \u725b k'ien nin (Pharbitis), are white or of a purple colour. The fruit is more than an inch long, as large as a jujube. Within the capsule are the seeds. These are light, flattened, winged like the seeds of the elm tree. When ripe the fruit bursts, and then the seeds are carried off by the wind.\n\nThe t'ung tree is figured in Ch. [XXXIII, 46]. Cordate leaves, ovoid acuminate fruit. According to Henry [l.c., 490] this is the Paulownia imperialis, S. & Z., called pao t'ung in Hnpei. It is a common tree in the middle part of China. [See David, Troisi\u00e8me Voyage dans l'Empire chinois, I, 22, 65, 94, 275; II, 69]. The above Chinese description of the t'ung agrees with Paulownia. I have no doubt this was the t'ung mentioned in the Classics, the wood of which was used for making lutes.\n\nAlthaea arbor dipyrena, flore digitalis semulo. Arbor satis vasta, cortice pingui, glabro, glauco... ligno levissimo, firmo tamen et a serinariis pro fabricandis capsulis expedito: medulla albissima, etc. Detailed description and a good drawing. This is the Bignonia tomentosa of Thunberg or Paulownia imperialis, S. & Z.

K'ung Ying-ta says it is called a bad tree because it is good only for fuel.\n\nThe ch'u is repeatedly mentioned in the Shan hai king. The Shuo wen says the name is also written \u6a39.\n\nLi ki:\u2014The bark of the ch'u tree contains varnish and is of a green colour. Its leaves have a fetid smell.\n\nP. [XXXVa, 12] describes the ch'u together with the \u690d ch'un, which is the Cedrela sinensis [v. infra, 520]. Li Shih-ch'en says:\u2014The fragrant kind is called ch'un, the fetid is ch'u. Su Kung [7th century] states that the ch'un and the ch'u much resemble each other in their appearance, only the wood of the ch'u is of a loose texture, while that of the ch'un is firm and tough. Su Sung [11th century] says:\u2014These two trees are common both in the northern and in the southern provinces. The ch'un has fragrant leaves which can be eaten, while the leaves of the ch'u have an offensive smell. The people of Kiang tung call this latter \u9b3c\u76ee kui ma (imp's eyes) or \u864e\u773c\u6a39 hu yen tsung (tiger eyes tsung). Li Shih-ch'en explains that these latter names refer to certain dots found at the base of the leaves (leaflets).\n\nCh., XXXV, 3, ch'u or \u81ed\u6a39 ch'ou ch'un (stinking ch'un). A good drawing of Ailantus glandulosa, leaves and fruit.\nThis is a very common tree in Northern China. Its common name at Peking is ch'ou ch'un. It has the same name in Hupei [Henry, l.c., 85]. Disagreeable odour of the leaves and the flowers, whence the name. The leaves of the Ailantus (large pinnate, from one to two feet long) are very similar to those of the Chinese Cedrela, a tree likewise common in the neighbourhood of Peking. But on closer examination the leaves of the Ailantus are easily distinguished by the two little glands near the basis of each leaflet, to which the species name \"glandulosa\" refers. The Ailantus grows very easily and rapidly, and its wood is used only for fuel, as it was in the classical period. It is well known also in Europe.\n\nAilantus glandulosa does not occur in Japan. Japanese botanists apply the Chinese name \u69d0 to Euscaphis staphyleoides, S. & Z., Flora japonica, I, 124, tab. 67, (Sambucus japonica, Thbg., Ailantus japonica, Bl.), a shrub of the order Staphylaceae found also in China. [See Hoffm. & Schultes, 237, Koei ui, 92.] Kempper [Journ. c.e.d., 895] applies the above Chinese character, evidently by a mistake, to kioh or dara, which is Acanthopanax spinosum, Miq.\n\nE., 253, family \u69d0.

A tree mentioned in the Shi king [176, 273].\n\nThe Rh ya [224] calls the k'ao the \u5c71\u69d0 shan or mountain ch'u.\n\nLu ki:\u2014The mountain ch'u does not differ considerably from the ch'u which grows in the plain, only its leaves are narrower. The people of \u5433 Wu (northern part of Chekiang) gather its leaves and use them for tea. But in another\npassage Lu ki says that the k'ao [he does not say that the kao and the shan ch'u are the same] has leaves resembling those of the li [an oak, v. infra, 531], whence it is also called k'ao li. The bark of the tree is several inches thick. The wood is used for making wheel-spokes.\n\nWilliams [Dict., 327] is of opinion that the k'ao may be a kind of Rhus.\n\nA synonym of \u6978 [v. 520].\n\n520.\u2014\u6a39 Ch'un. This tree is noticed in the Shu king [112, \"Tribute of Y\u00fc\"] as growing in the Province of \u8346\u5dde King chou (Hukung).\n\nK'ung An-kuo says that another name for it is \u6a39 ch'un. This latter appears in the Shan hai king. Kuo P'o explains that it resembles the ch'u (518, Lilantos) and is well known to the people of \u5433 Wu (Chekiang). The wood is good for making thills of carriages.\n\nAccording to the Shuo wen the name is also written \u6a39 ch'un.\n\nIn P. [XXXVa, 12] this tree is spoken of under the name of \u6a39 ch'un [v. supra, 518] which is also an ancient designation, for it appears in the works of Chuang tsz' [4th century B.C.] as the name of a long-lived tree. As has already been stated, this is the Cedrela sinensis, A. Juss., (Meliaceae), a common tree at Peking, where it is more commonly known under the name of \u9999\u6a39 liang ch'un (fragrant ch'un). Its fragrant leaf-buds in spring are used by the Chinese for food. See the drawings in Ch. [XXXV, 2] and the Kiu huang [LIV, 6].\n\nPhon zo, LXXXII, 17, 18, \u6a39 Cedrela sinensis.\n\nE., 253, family \u6a39.

These two characters appear in the Classics as names of a plant (shrub) and have, according to the ancient commentators, the same meaning.\nOriginally *king* was the name of one of the nine provinces into which China was divided in the time of Emperor Yu. This province comprised the present Hupeh and the greater part of Hunan, and subsequently became a large feudal state called King and afterwards Ts'un or Ch'u. The *Shi king* calls it King Ts'un.\n\n\u695a *Ch'u*, according to the *Shuo wen*, has the meaning \u6811\u6728 (trees thickly crowded) and in this sense it is used in the *Shi king* [368]. But sometimes in the *Shi* it denotes also a distinct plant. Legge says:\u2014A species of thorn tree employed for fuel.\n\n*Shi king*, 16:\u2014Many are the bundles of firewood; I would cut down the thorns (*ch'u*) to form more. 115, 145:\u2014A bundle of thorns (*ch'u*). 180:\u2014Round and round the thorns (*ch'u*) are bound.\n\nMao says that the *ch'u* is a tree. Other commentators say it is a kind of \u8346 *king*, and the *Shuo wen* explains *king* by *ch'u* tree. The name *king* occurs frequently in the *Shan hai king* and generally coupled with \u67cf *ki* (*Lycium*).\n\n*Chou li*, II, 581:\u2014The *king* wood used for making bows. [See the quotation in 501, note.]\n\n*Li ki*, II, 84 [\"Teaching in the great College\"]:\u2014The canes and the thorns were there to secure in the pupils a proper awe. What Legge translates by \"canes and thorns\" is \u590f and \u8346 *king* in the Chinese text. Regarding the first character the commentary refers to the *Rh ya* [223], suggesting that it stands for \u6a2a *hia* (*Catalpa*, v. supra, 508). With respect to the *king*, a passage of the *Shu king* is quoted [38, 39] where the five inflictions introduced by the Emperor Shun are recorded. \u4f5c \u6559 \u5211, the stick (*king*) to be employed in schools.\n\n*Tso chuan*, 526, referring to the year B.C. 545:\u2014They spread some *king* (\u8346) branches on the ground and ate\ntogether. This passage seems to imply that the king was not a thorny plant, as Legge states.\n\nAt Peking the names \u8346\u5b50 king tsz or \u8346\u6761 king tiao are applied to *Vitis incisa*, Lam., a very common shrub in the neighbourhood of Peking; and the plant figured under king tsz in the Kin hsiang [LV, 4] is without doubt the same *Vitis*. *V. incisa* is extensively employed in basket making, and the name king tiao (king twigs) refers to this use. It is also used for fuel and for burning charcoal. It is a handsome shrub; in the plain the stem is generally not thicker than the little finger, but in the mountains, when allowed to grow, it becomes a tree. I have seen trees of *V. incisa*, the trunk as thick as one's arm. It has no thorns. The leaves are compound, generally five leaflets deeply toothed. The leaves have a strong smell of *Artemisia*. It flowers in August; small blue flowers in branchlet panicles. It is well represented in Ch. [XXXIII, 27].\n\nP. [XXXVI, 56-62] describes under the name of king several species of *Vitis* and also other plants. Li Shichen states that the names king and ch'iu (for *Vitis*) are derived from the names of the ancient State in which these plants grew abundantly. The character \u8346 king is said to have originated from \u5211 king (punishment), for in ancient times king staves were used in corporal punishment.\n\nP. speaks first of the \u7261\u8346 mou king (male king), also called \u9ec4\u8346 huang king (yellow king), the ch'iu or king of the Classics. It grows abundantly everywhere in the mountains. The people cut it and use it for fuel. If not cut for many years it becomes a tree of considerable size. The heart of the wood is square. The branches grow bushy. The leaves are compound; five, sometimes seven, leaflets are inserted upon a common leaf-stalk. The leaflets are long and pointed with the margin serrate and toothed. The leaves\nare fragrant. In the 5th month it produces violet flowers in panicles. The seed is as large as that of Coriander. This description agrees with Vitex. Another sort of king is described under the name of \u85e4\u523a non king. The first character means a creeper. Lu Shu-chien observes that this is an improper name, as the plant does not creep; it has only a weak stem.\n\nAccording to Henry [l.c., 132] \u9ec3\u523a in Hupei is Vitex negundo, L.\n\nPhu zo, LXXXIX, 15, 16. \u7261\u523a, Vitex cannabifolia; S. & Z., Ibidem, 17, 18. \u85e4\u523a, Vitex trifolia, L. Siebold, Icon. Ind., VI, \u85e4\u523a, V. urata, Thbg., (same as V. trifolia).\n\nMorrison, Williams and Legge all agree in stating that the ch'iu or king is a thorny bush, and Legge even translates ch'iu by thorns. I have not been able to make out to what Chinese sources of information they refer. The Chinese commentators on the Classics do not speak of the ch'iu as of a thorny shrub, nor does K.D. under ch'iu and king give this meaning. The ch'iu is without doubt Vitex, and all the species of this genus are unarmed. I suspect that this misapprehension arose from an incorrect interpretation of the term \u85e4\u523a which is of frequent occurrence in ancient Chinese writings. It means, according to W.D. [403] thorny, useless. The character \u85e4 ki [see 485] denotes, indeed, a thorny shrub, the wild jinjube, which in the Peking mountains frequently grows together with Vitex. See the quotation from the Tso chuan [485] where Legge translates \"briars and thorns.\" In the Han mu tsz we find the term \u85e4\u695a.\n\nE., 270, family \u85e4 with good figure of Vitex negundo, L.\n\nThe eight synonyms include also \u7d2b\u523a, Cercis chinensis, Bge., of which a good figure is given in P., XXXVI.

Douglas translates:\u2014Droop the willows. But the first character stands probably for \u79c0, and I understand this sentence to mean: the poplars are in seed.\n\nThere are in the environs of Peking two poplars, both very common trees. One of them, the Populus alba, L., is a tall tree with large, roundish leaves inserted upon long, slender foot-stalks; they produce a rustling noise, like P. tremula. The Chinese call it \u767d\u694a pai yang (white poplar) or \u5927\u8449\u694a ta ye yang (poplar with large leaves). In Hupei pai yang is P. tremula, L. [see Henry, l.c., 543]. The other Peking poplar; P. suaveolens, Fischer, does not attain the height of the white poplar; its leaves are also smaller, oblong, pointed. This is the \u5c0f\u8449\u694a xiao ye yang (small leaved poplar), called also \u9752\u694a ts'ing yang or green poplar. Both are correctly described and depicted in Ch. [XXXV, 4, 5] only the names in the two plates have been confounded.\n\nP., XXXVb, 27, pai yang. The Ku kin chu [4th century] defines the differences between the Chinese poplars and the willow, stating that the pai yang has round leaves, the ts'ing yang oblong leaves, and the lin or willow long narrow leaves.\n\nAnother ancient work, quoted in P., says, regarding the white poplar, that its leaves quiver even when the air is still, producing a noise like heavy rain.\n\nPhon zo, LXXXIV, 22, \u767d\u694a. Populus tremula.\n\nV. supra, 252.\n\n524.\u2014The \u67f3 liu of the Classics is the willow, and especially Salix babylonica, L., a Chinese tree in common cultivation all over the empire. At least the Chinese nowadays by liu always understand this tree. Legge means that liu was the drooping willow; but although in Europe S. babylonica is called the weeping or drooping willow\u2014for the European tree always represents the form with drooping branches\u2014the\nBabylonian willow in China has generally upright branches. The weeping willow is seldom seen in the north of China; the drooping of the branches is produced artificially. In the south it seems to be more frequent. At Peking they call it \u5782\u694a\u67f3 ch'i\u00fci yang liu (drooping willow).\n\nShi king, 155:\u2014You fence your garden with branches of willow (liu). 337:\u2014Luxuriant grow those willows (liu). 408:\u2014There is a luxuriant willow tree (liu). Who would not wish to take shelter under it? 261:\u2014When we set out, the willows were fresh and green. The Chinese text has \u6953\u67f3 yang liu.\n\nHua Calendar:\u2014First month. The willow trees (liu) bud.\n\nThe liu is mentioned in the Shau hai king.\n\nChou li, II, 194:\u2014Fire from the willow wood. [See quotation in 528, note. See also 530:\u2014Willow trees about graves.] Mao explains liu by wood that has little strength; the Shuo wen writes \u6953 liu, and explains the character by \u5c0f\u694a (small poplar).\n\nP., XXXVb, 21, \u6953 liu, also \u6953\u67f3 yang liu. Su Kung [7th century] says the liu has long, narrow leaves. Ch'en Ts'ang-k'\u0131 [8th century] states that the people of Kiangtung call the liu \"yang liu.\" Li Shih-ch'en observes that the branches of the yang (poplar) are tough and erect, those of the liu, weak and bent down.\n\nCh., XXXIII, 48, liu, Salix babylonica.\n\nHenry, l.c., 540, yang liu.

The commentators on the Classics (Cheng Huan and others) are of opinion that the character \u84b2, generally denoting the reed-mace, is in one passage of the Shi king to be referred to the p'u lin. Legge translates it [115]:\u2014The fretted waters do not carry on their current a bundle of \"osiers\" (p'u). In the same sense p'u is interpreted in the Tso chuan [314, 320]:\u2014Will it be possible to exhaust the willows (p'u) in the Tung marsh? According to the Rh ya [252] p'u lin is a synonym for yang (poplar), but the commentators do not accept this view.\n\nLu ki says, regarding the p'u lin:\u2014There are two kinds. That with a green bark is called \u5c0f\u694a siao yang (the willow, lin, according to the Shuo wen); the other, with a white bark, is \u5927\u694a ta yang (the great yang, or poplar). The leaves (of the former) are long, like those of the lin or willow. Arrow shafts can be made of the p'u lin, as is alluded to in the Tso chuan [see the quotation above]. Now the people employ it for making sieves and buckets.\n\nThe Ku kin chu [4th century] states that the p'u lin grows along the edge of the water. It has long leaves, like those of the \u9752\u694a ts'ing yang [c. supra, 523]. It is also called \u84b2\u694a p'u yang, \u6c34\u694a shui yang, water-poplar. It has weak, pliable branches, which are much used by the people for making baskets, etc.\n\nP. [XXXVI, 26] speaks of this willow under the name of shui yang.

Its leaves are coarse and white (downy). Its wood is finely veined and of a reddish colour, it is fit for making wheel-naves. Now the people take its twigs and, after rendering them pliable by fire, use them for making trunks. It grows best on the \u6c5f K'e river (a tributary of the Wei in the north-east of Honan), also in the kingdom of Lu near the T'ai mountain, on the river \u6c76 Wen (in Shantung).\n\n*Mencius*, 270:\u2014The philosopher Kao said:\u2014Man's nature is like the *k'i* willow (*k'i lin*), and righteousness is like a cup or a bowl. *K'i* and *lin* are taken by some as two trees, but more generally the commentators take them together.\n\n2.\u2014The other and principal meaning of *k'i* in the *Shi* is that of \u67af \u67b3 *kou k'i*, a name erroneously rendered in *W.D.* [347] by *Berberis Lycium*, and referred to the medlar by Legge. The *kou k'i* is *Lycium chinense*, Mill., the Chinese box-thorn.\n\n*Shi king*, 248:\u2014The doves on the bushy medlars (*k'i*). 266:\u2014I ascended the hill in the north to gather the medlars (*k'i*). 272:\u2014On the hills of the south are medlars (*k'i*). 360:\u2014I ascend that northern hill and gather the medlar. 359:\u2014Medlars in the marshes.\n\nIn the *Rh ya* [257] \u67af \u67b3 *kou ki* is given as a synonym of *k'i*. The *Shuo wen* writes \u67af \u67b3, as the name is now written.\n\nLu ki:\u2014The *k'i* is a tree which resembles the \u8292 (*Ailanthus*, see 518). It is also called \u82e6 \u67b3 *k'u k'i* (bitter *k'i*) and \u5730 \u9aa8 *ti ku*. In spring it affords a savoury food (the\nleaves); it is somewhat bitter. In its stem it resembles the \u8354 mei (raspberry). The fruit ripens in autumn and then becomes red. Leaves, stem and fruit have medical virtues.\n\nP., XXXVI, 47, kou ki. Many synonyms given. The Pie lu [5th century] calls it \u7f8a\u4e73 yang ju (goat's teat), from the shape of the fruit. Su Sung [11th century] says that the kou ki is a common plant. The young leaves, when they first appear in spring, are like those of the pomegranate tree, but softer and thinner. They are eaten, and known by the name of tien ts'ai (sweet vegetable). The plant grows in a bushy manner to the height of three or four feet. In the 6th or 7th month it puts forth small purplish flowers and afterwards produces a red, oblong fruit like a jujube. Its root is called \u5730\u9aa8 ti ku (earth bone). Other ancient authors say that the kou ki is provided with thorns, but they are wanting when it grows high. The fruit also varies in shape, being sometimes globular.\n\nLi Shu-chuen states that the best sorts of kou ki are found in the Provinces of Shensi and Kansu, where it grows to the height of a tree. The fruit, which resembles a cherry, is dried. It tastes like the grape. The fruit and root are used as medicines.\n\nThe plants figured in the Kin huang [LVI, 1] and Ch. [XXXIII, 25] under kou ki are Lycium. What I received under the same Chinese name from the Belgian missionaries in the Ordos were the dried berries of a Lycium. Kreitner states [in the Osterr. Monatsschr. f. d. Orient, 1883, p. 73-76] that in Kansu the red berries of a wild-growing shrub are dried and exported to all the provinces of China under the name of kou chi. They are said to have an intoxicating effect. Several species of Lycium have been gathered in those regions by Russian travellers (Prezewalsky, Piassetsky, Potanin), L. chinense, L. turcomanicum, L. ruthenicum,\nL. chinense is a common plant in Northern China as well as in the South. At Peking it is a rambling shrub (never arborescent), sometimes twining, with long, weak recurved or pendulous branches, armed with short spines. Leaves lanceolate, oblong. Violet flowers in the axils of the leaves. The fruit is a small ovoid red berry, not eatable. Henry l.c., 185:\u2014In Hupeh Lycium chinense is kon kei.\n\nPhan zo, LXXXIX, 3, 4, \u67b8\u675e.

Its bark is of a dark red colour. Its branches and leaves resemble those of the pine.

The Rh ya i states:\u2014The\ncheng liu is a very graceful tree. Its leaves resemble floss-silk. The tree knows when rain is imminent, and indicates it by its leaves moving. It is not injured either by hoar-frost or snow. K'ou Tsung-shi [beginning of the 12th century] says that it is commonly called \u4e09\u6625\u67f3 san ch'un liu (three springs' willow), for it flowers three times a year. Li Shu-chen adds that it is a small tree with a red bark and weak branches; leaves like floss-silk; pale red flowers, like those of the liao (Polygonum), in spikes from three to four inches long. In Ch. [XXXV, 37] a rude figure of the cheng liu. Evidently Tamarix is intended.\n\nThree species of Tamarix are known in China, viz.: T. chinensis, Lour., T. juniperina, Bge., T. Pullasi, Desv. T. chinensis is the most common of these three and seems to be found all over China. It is a tree of middle size, with minute acute imbricate leaves. The twigs are glabrous and of a reddish brown colour. Panicles formed of long, dense spikes of small, pale red flowers. Its common name at Peking is san ch'un liu.\n\nKia wi, 104, \u4e09\u6625\u67f3, Tamarix chinensis, Phou zo, LXXX, 18, 19, \u693f\u67f3 T. chinensis.\n\nE., 305, family \u8d64\u690f, with figure apparently of Tamarix, and 11 names.\n\nE., 264, family \u693f, has the name \u693f, from the Rh ya, as a synonym.\n\nJap., 2174, Tamarix chinensis, Lour., \u693f\u67f3.\n\nA., XV, 138, \u89c0\u97f3\u67f3, is one of the synonyms.

Its leaves resemble those of the elm, and may be eaten cooked; they are more mucilaginous than those of the white elm. There are ten different sorts of elms, they resemble each other in their leaves but differ in the bark and the texture of the wood.\n\nThis thorny elm, noticed also in P. [article Y\u00fc, elm] is probably the Hemiptelea Daridiana, Planch., a shrub or small tree of the order Ulmaceae, provided with large thorns, not uncommon in the Peking plain and in the mountains.

Legge translates it by \"six elms.\"\n\nThe character po is also written \u99ff [see W.D., 708]. In the Rh ya [271] it is said to be a red plum, but in the section on domestic animals po is given as the name of an animal\nlike a horse with strong teeth, which eats tigers and leopards. According to the *Shih hai king*, it is a white beast with a black tail. Mao takes the *po* of the *Shi* to be an animal. Bu Lu ki makes it to be a kind of elm called \u6866\u6986 (*tsz' yu*), the rind of which is white and green like a piebald horse, whence the name.\n\n**Hoffm. & Schultes**, 198:\u2014\u516d\u99ff *Daphnoidium lancefolium*, S. & Z., of the order Laurineae.\n\n*E.*, 269, family \u6866\u6986, *Ulmus*, \u99ff is one of the nine synonyms.\n\n*E.*, 230, family \u674e, *Prunus*, it is also a synonym.\n\n*Laurineae* [v. supra, 512].\n\n533.\u2014Another obscure tree, said to be an elm, is mentioned in the *Chou li* [II, 391]:\u2014Le frappeur du tambour en terre cuite, charg\u00e9 de tuer les mauvais esprits de l'eau, prend une branche d'orme m\u00e2le; il la perce en travers avec une dent d'\u00e9l\u00e9phant et la plonge dans l'eau. Alors les esprits meurent. The male elm in the Chinese text is \u7261\u6a2b *mou ku*. Cheng Huan explains it by \u67af\u6a2b *ku yu*.\n\n534.\u2014Five or six names of trees mentioned in the Classics refer to Oaks. Some of these names are still in use, but it seems that the same appellations are applied to different species in different parts of China. China seems to be rich in oaks. F. B. Forbes [in the *Journal Bot.*, 1884, p. 80] enumerates 28 species of *Quercus* hitherto observed by European botanists in China.\n\nFather Cibot [in the *M\u00e9moires conc. les Chinois*, III, 482] states, in an article on Chinese oaks, that the ancient Chinese called the oak \"l'arbre de l'h\u00e9ritage.\" I have not been able to make out to what passage of the Classics or other ancient writings he refers.\n\n*Shi king*, 201:\u2014Bushy oaks (\u6a2b *li*) on the mountains. 183:\u2014The wild geese settle on the bushy oaks (\u6a2b *h\u016b*). 248:\u2014Doves on the bushy oaks (*h\u016b*). 301:\u2014Yellow bird, do not settle on the oaks (*h\u016b*).\nPLANTS MENTIONED IN CLASSICAL WORKS.\n\nIbid., 373:\u2014Split the branches of the oaks (\u67e4 tso) for fire-wood, amid the luxuriance of their leaves. 403:\u2014On the branches of the oaks (tso) how abundant are the leaves! 411, 450:\u2014The oaks (tso) and the yu (\u6936) were thinned, and roads for travelling were opened. 445:\u2014Thick grow the oaks (tso) and the yu, which the people use for fuel. 442:\u2014Abundant is the growth of the yu and the p'o (\u6936) supplying fire-wood.\n\nChou li, II, 387:\u2014Les arracheurs des arbres (\u67e4 tso) sont charg\u00e9s de l'abattage des arbres, de la destruction des plantes sauvages, du d\u00e9frichement des for\u00eats et des c\u00f4tes bois\u00e9es. II, 194:\u2014Fire from the wood of the \u67e4 tso tree. [See quotation in 528, note. See also supra, 469.]\n\nRh ya, 264:\u2014The fruit of the \u67e4 li is called \u6924 kiu. Sun Yen explains that this is the \u6924 siang.\n\nRh ya, 239:\u2014\u67e4 h\u016b, same as \u67e4 chu. Kuo P'o says:\u2014Same as \u67e4 tso. The Shuo wen says the fruit of the \u67e4 ha is \u6924 (this character here, according to K.D., stands for \u6924) or \u6924 tso.\n\nOf the above names, \u6924, \u6924, \u67e4, \u6924 appear also in the Shan hai king.\n\nCheng Huan, in commenting upon the Shi, says that \u67e4 and \u6924 are the same.\n\nLu ki:\u2014The \u67e4 li tree. The people of \u79e6 Tsin (Eastern Kansu and Shensi) call it also \u67e4 tso, the people of Ho nei (Northern Honan) \u6728 \u85e4 mu liao or li. It is allied to the \u6924 tsiao sha [Lu ki is mistaken. Compare the Rh ya, 329]. The house of the seed (\u5b50 \u623f, he means the cupule of the acorn) is called \u6924 kiu.\n\nIn another place Lu ki states:\u2014The \u67e4 h\u016b is now called \u67e4 tso or \u67e4 li. The people of \u5f90 \u5dde S\u016b chou (Northern Kiangsu) call it li or \u67e4 chu, also h\u016b. Its fruit is called \u9ce5 tso or \u9ce5 \u6597 tso tou. Its covering (the cupule) contains a\nsap which is used for dyeing black. In \u6cb3\u5357 (Honan) and \u5317\u65b9 (Northern Honan) they call it \u6851\u6c41 chu chi or \u6851\u6597 siang tou, or li.\n\nLu ki notices further the \u6851 ya as an oak, stating that it is the same as the tso. One kind, with a white wood without a red heart, is called \u767d\u6a2b pai jui. It has straight veins, is easily split, and is good for making cases, axles, lances and spears. But the pai jui, or ya, according to the Rh ya [300], is not an oak.\n\nIn P. [XXX, 53, article \u6851\u5be6 siang-fruit] all the above names are given as synonyms of siang. These names are probably applied to several allied species of Quercus.\n\nSu Suxg [11th century] says: \u6851 li or \u6851 tso is the name of the wood, whilst the fruit (rather the cupule) is called \u6851\u6597 siang tou. It is used for dyeing black. The cupules of the \u6851 hu [another oak, see 535] can be used for the same purpose, but the siang tou is considered the best. The siang tree grows from 20 to 30 feet high.\n\nK'ou Tsuxg-shi [beginning of 12th century] states:\u2014The leaves of the li tree resemble those of the chestnut. The wood although tough is not much valued as timber, but the best charcoal can be made of it. The cupules of the fruit are employed in dyeing black.\n\nLi Shi-cheng adds:\u2014There are two sorts of the li tree. One of them does not bear fruit, the heart of its wood is red. This is called \u6851 ya and is mentioned in the Shi together with the tso. The wood of the other kind, which produces fruit, is called \u6851 hu and its fruit \u6851 siang. Yellow flowers like those of the chestnut. This is much cultivated in the Northern provinces. Large trees, the timber used for pillars, the smaller trees for fuel and for making charcoal. The fruit is eaten by the people; it is also good for fattening swine.\n\nThe \u6851 siang at Peking is the Quercus Bungeana, Forbes (Q. chinensis, Bge.). D'Incarville calls it Q. custanefolia.\nIt is a tree of middle size, common in the mountains. Its leaves strongly resemble those of the chestnut. The cupule is covered outside with long, lanceolate, reflexed scales. The Chinese call this cupule \u6a61\u6900\u5b50 siang wan tsz' (wan a cup) and use it extensively for dyeing black.\n\nThe drawing of the siang in Ch. [XXXII, 41] is very rude, but it seems Quercus Bungeana is intended.\n\nC. Abel [see his Journey in the Interior of China, 1816, 1817, p. 165] gathered near the Poyang lake in Kiangsi two oaks which R. Brown named Q. chinensis and Q. densifolia. They were used by the natives as pollards, considerable quantities of the branches being accumulated for fire-wood or for charring. These may have been among the oaks referred to in the Classics. Henry [l.c., 233, 234, 235] mentions several oaks to which in Hupei the names li and siang are applied.\n\nThe Q. Bungeana is not found in Japan. The Japanese botanists have applied the Chinese names siang and li to an allied small-leaved species, the Q. serrata, Thbg. Amoen. exot., 816:\u2014\u6a2b reki, vulgo kunugi, etc. Ilex rubra, ligno in rufum langnente, darissimo. Siebold [Syn. plant. accon. jap., 153] Q. serrata, kusugi, \u6a2b.

According to Kuo P'o, an oak.\n\nP., XXX, 55, \u6a2b\u5be6 hu shi (fruit) or \u6a2b\u6a2b hu su or \u6a2b\u6a2b p'o su, also \u5927\u8449\u6a2b ta ye li (large-leaved li) and \u6a2b\u6a2b\u5b50 li kiang tsz'.\n\nSu Sung [11th century]:\u2014The hu is a common tree in the mountains. It is akin to the li (i.e., it is likewise an oak). The acorns are smaller and are not gathered, as they\nare of no use. But the bark and leaves are employed in medicine.\n\nK'ou Tsung-shi [beginning of the 12th century] states:\u2014The wood of the tree is hard, but not much valued as timber; it is more generally employed for fuel and for charring; but this charcoal is inferior to that obtained from the li wood.\n\nLi Shih-ch'en:\u2014There are two kinds of hu. One is small, grows in a bushy manner; the Rh ya calls it \u6866 pao [v. supra, 284, probably Celtis]. The other, called ta ye li, is a tall tree with large, thick, coarse leaves which fall off in winter. Flowers like those of the chestnut. The fruits resemble those of the siang [see the preceding], but are smaller; they have a cupule. Although the acorns have an unpleasant taste, they are eaten by the people in time of scarcity. The wood is coarsely veined, and less valued than that of the siang.\n\nAt Peking the name hu is applied to Quercus dentata, Thbg. (same as Q. obovata, Bge.), but the tree is more commonly known under the name of po lo shu. The leaves of this oak are sessile, obovate, sinuate, of enormous size on young specimens, sometimes nearly two feet long. The cupule outside is scaly, like that of Q. Bungeana, but the scales consist of thin filaments. This species, and probably some other broad-leaved oaks, may have been the po su of the Shi, used for fuel.\n\nCh.

The yu tree is frequently mentioned in the Shan hai king. Kuo P'o says:\u2014\u525b\u6728 Kang mu, a hard wood used in making carts. The kang mu is likewise noticed in the Shan hai king. Kuo P'o says that it resembles the \u6a9c [v. 540] and the \u6850 [v. 501]. It is probably also an oak. Ch. [XXXVII, 5] and the Kiu huang [LIV, 23] under \u9752\u5ca1\u6728 ts'ing kang mu, describe and figure oaks.\n\nThe dictionary Kuang yun (T'ang dynasty) identifies the yu with tso (oak); the dictionary T'ang yun says it is a red wood.\n\nAccording to Geerts, Japanese Woods, \u6a9c in Japan is Quercus crispula, Bl.\n\n538.\u2014\u6945 Chou. Name of a tree mentioned in the Shan hai king and the Shuo wen.\n\nAccording to Henry [l.c., 82] this Chinese name is applied in Hupei to Quercus glauca, Thbg., and other species. The wood is very hard. The chou tree is figured in Ch. [XXXVII, 1], and is said to grow in Hunan. Two varieties, a red and a white, are noticed.\n\n539.\u2014\u6945 Chu. This name is of frequent occurrence in the Shan hai king. Kuo P'o explains that it is an evergreen\ntree resembling the \u6866 tso (Quercus). It produces an edible fruit. Incorruptible timber used for posts in building houses.\n\nP., XXX, 52, \u6a1f\u5b50 chu tsz'. Li Shi-chen says that there are two kinds of chu. One of them is a large evergreen tree with serrate, shining leaves resembling those of the chestnut. The fruit is as large as that of the hu [Quercus, 535], pointed. The edible seed (acorn) is enclosed in an involucre (cupule) and is known under the name of \u7cd6\u6a1f\u5b50 tien (sweet) chu tsz' or \u9ea5\u6a1f\u5b50 mien (mealy) chu tsz'. The other kind is the \u82e6\u6a1f\u5b50 k'u (bitter) chu tsz'. Its wood is coarsely veined and of a red colour. It is also called \u8840\u6a1f hwe (blood) chu.\n\nThe first of the trees mentioned, that with edible acorns, is, according to Henry [l.c., 95], Quercus sclerophylla, Lindl.

The people of \u4e0a\u9ee8 Shang tang (South-eastern Shansi) employ it in basket-making and for ladies' hair-pins.\n\nThat is all we know from the ancient authors regarding the hu tree. Although Legge calls it the arrow-thorn, Chinese authors do not say that it has thorns. It seems that this tree or shrub is still known under its ancient name in China.

According to the Rh ya [230] it is also called \u69d0 i. Kuo Po says it resembles the \u69d0 ti [Prunus, v. supra, 476].\n\nThe \u69d0 i is mentioned in the Chou li [II, 194] as a tree of which bows can be made. [See the quotation in 501, note.]\nThe *Shuo wen* explains *i* ley \u6843 \u4ec1 [Ceratula, v. supra, 520].\n\n**Lu ki:**\u2014The leaves of the *nin* or *i* tree resemble those of the apricot, but are more pointed, white (downy). Its bark is red. The wood grows very crooked. Luxuriant leaves. In the second month it opens its white flowers like those of the \u6843 *lien* (*Melia*) with a silky appearance and small stamens. The tree is now cultivated in the government gardens. It goes also by the name of \u842c\u6b72 *nin sui* (the myriad years or everlasting). Its original name is explained by \u5104 *i*, which means myriads. The leaves are handsome. The tree is much cultivated at the foot of mountains. It is also called \u725b\u7b4b *nin kin*.

Ibidem, II, 194:\u2014Fire from the huai wood. [See quotation in 528, note. See also in 550, huai trees planted about the graves of functionaries.]\n\nHuai is now the common name for Sophora japonica, L., a tree very common throughout China. It is frequently mentioned in the Sh\u00ean kai king. It would, however, seem from the Rh ya [288-290] that in ancient times the name huai was applied to several trees of the leguminous order. P. [XXXVa, 31] describes under this name only Sophora japonica. It is well represented in Ch. [XXXIII, 19].\n\nAmoen. exot., 841, \u69d0 quai vulgo jens et quai kaka.

I am not aware upon what authority this identification is based. *Douglas* refers the \u91c7\u6851 *shi* of the *Hia Calendar* to the plant \u82e6\u85f7 *k'u che* of the *Pen ts'ao kung mu*, which name is there applied to two different plants [see *P.*, XVI, 33, 37]. One of them is a *Physalis*, [V., the *Rh ya*, 144]. I should rather think that the *shi* of the *Hia Calendar* is the \u82e6\u85f7 *k'u shi*, a medicinal plant noticed in the *Shen nung pen ts'ao* and otherwise called \u82e6\u53c3 *k'u shen*. [See *P.*, XIII, 32.] Judging by the description given there of the plant, it belongs to the leguminous order. The root is very bitter. *Ch.* [VIII, 5] figures, under *k'u shen*, a leguminous plant. *Loureiro* [*Flora cochin.*, 556] gives *kha sem* as the Chinese name for *Robinia unara* [unknown to botanists], the root of which, he says, is \"umarissima.\" According to *Henry* [*I.e.*, 190] at Ichang *k'u shen* is *Sophora kronei*, Hance.\n\n*So moku*, XIV, 28, \u82e6\u53c3, *Sophora angustifolia*, S. & Z.\n\n*E.*, 161, family \u82e6\u53c3, with two figures, copies of *S.*, II, 21.\n\n*C.*, 635, *Sophora flavescens*, Ait.\n\n*Smi.*, 186, *Robinia*.\n\n*E.*, 64, family \u85e4, *Houttonia*, \u85e4 is one of the synonyms [*V. supra*, 144].\n\n518.\u2014\u6885 *I*, also written \u6885, and sometimes read \u6843.\n\n*Hia Calendar*, 21, first month:\u2014\u6885\u674f\u6885\u6843\u5247\u83ef. *Douglas* translates:\u2014Plum, apricot, mountain peach trees then blossom. The Chinese commentary explains indeed \u6885\u6843 by \u5c71\u6843 (mountain peach) referring, it seems, to the\nRh ya [268], but \u6978 in the Rh ya [226] is a distinct tree, likened to the white poplar.\n\nLi ki, I, 158:\u2014The i wood used for coffins. [See the quotation in 508.]\n\n549.\u2014\u6a3a Chen. A wood mentioned in the Li ki [I, 401, and II, 5]. Ladles and combs made of this wood. The commentary says that the wood is white veined. It is also mentioned in the Shu hai king, together with the \u6a3a tsou. W.D. [961] takes tsou chen to be one name, but Kuo Po keeps tsou and chen apart. The Shua wen defines tsou by fuel.\n\n550.\u2014\u6a3a Luan (luan), a tree mentioned in the Chou li [II, 517]. Biot reads lien. Cuiseurs de soie. Pour appr\u00eater les \u00e9toffes de soie, ils font bouillir dans l'eau, des cendres faites avec le bois de l'arbre lien. Avec cette eau clarifi\u00e9e on humecte les \u00e9toffes de soie.\n\nAccording to the dictionary Ts' yun [Sung period], the above character is to be pronounced luan. Some say that it is the same as \u6a3a lien (Melia), others identify it with the \u6a3a luan.\n\nAs to the luan, it is said to have been one of the trees planted about graves in ancient times. [See the Chou li, II, 22, \u7d20\u4eba, Superintendent of the Graves. It was his duty, amongst others, to select the trees planted about the graves and to fix their number.] The commentary [not translated by Biot] quotes the Ch'un ts'iu wei [1st century B.C.], where it is stated:\u2014The tumulus for the grave of the Son of Heaven (\u5929\u5b50) was 30 feet high. Pine trees [\u677e v. supra, 504] were planted about it. The tumulus for the feudal princes (\u8af8\u4faf) was half as high, the trees planted about it were the \u67cf po (Thuja, v. supra, 505). The height of the tumulus for the high functionaries (\u5927\u592b) was 8 feet, the trees planted around were the \u6a3a luan [the original text has \u85e5\u8349.\nmedicinal herb, but the commentators observe that this is a mistake for luan. See also the Shuo wen, under luan]. The height of the tumulus for the other officers (\u58eb) was 4 feet, the trees planted about were the \u69d0 huai (Sophora, v. supra, 546). The common people (\u5eb6) were not entitled to a tumulus. \u694a\u67f3 yang lin trees (willows, v. supra, 524) were planted about the graves.\n\nP., XXXVII, 15: \u6a02\u83ef Luan hua. The ancient authors say that it is a tree growing in Middle China, with leaves resembling those of the mu kiu (Hibiscus syriacus), yellow flowers, and fruit like that of the suan ts'iang (Physalis alkekengi, v. supra, 55); the pea-like black seeds are contained in a bladder. The flowers are used for dyeing yellow, the seeds are employed in medicine and also used as beads. The tree is figured in the Kiu hsiung [LIV, 29] and in Ch. [XXXIII, 49]. It is the Kalreuteria paniculata, Laxm., which is very common in Northern China. Its fruit capsules resemble bladders. Its popular name at Peking is \u6728\u862d\u7259 mu lan ya. The leaves furnish a black dye.\n\nKwa wi, 120, and Phoi zu, LXXXIV, 4, 5: \u6a02\u83ef Kalreuteria paniculata.\n\nE., 308, family \u6a02\u83ef, with figure of Kalreuteria.\n\nSapindaceae are mentioned:\n\nJap., 28, Acer palmatum, Thbg., \u6a5f\u6a39.\n,, 36, ,, trifidum, Thbg., \u4e09\u89d2\u6a39.\n,, 68, Esculps turbinata, Bl., \u4e03\u8449\u6a39.\n,, 923, Enpholia (commonly Nephelium) Li-chi, Desf., \u8354\u679d.\n,, 924, ,, Lougana, Lam., \u9f8d\u773c.\n,, 930, Eucaphis staphylodes, S. & Z., \u91ce\u9d09\u693f [v. supra, 518].\n,, 1214, Kalreuteria paniculata, Laxm., \u6a02\u6a39.\n,, 1990, Sapindus Mukorosi, Gaertn., \u7121\u60a3\u6a39.\n,, 2141, Staphyloa bumalda, S. & Z., \u7701\u6cbe\u6cb9.\n551.\u2014\u6728\u862d Mu lan.

D'Herv\u00e9 here takes kian and koney as two distinct plants, but kian koney is one name, denoting a peculiar kind of cinnamon.\n\nP., XXXIV, 13:\u2014Kui. The ancient authors describe several sorts of cinnamon. The \u7261\u6842 man kui (male cinnamon) or \u6728\u6842 mu kui (tree cinnamon), said to be a thick bark from a tree with large leaves, which grows in \u5357\u6d77 Nan hai (Southern China), is that mentioned in the Rh ya. Another sort [P., XXXIV, 21] is called \u7bad\u6842 k\u00fcn kui. It is the bark of a smaller tree said to grow in the mountains of \u8d35\u5dde Kiao chi (Cochin-china). The Chinese Cassia trees are figured in Ch. [XXXIII, 7, 8].\n\nAt the end of the article kui kui, Li Shih-chen observes that the ancient authors comprised in this denomination another tree much cultivated in China under the names of \u94f6\u6842 yen kui or \u6728\u6a28 mu si. There are three varieties, one with white flowers \u94f6\u6842 yen kui, one with yellow flowers \u91d1\u6842 kin kui and one with red flowers \u4e39\u6842 tan kui. The flowers appear in autumn or in spring; some varieties have flowers the whole year. The bark of the tree is thin and has not the properties of the true cinnamon. The flowers are very fragrant and employed for scenting tea. This tree is the Olea fragrans, Thbg., a tree much cultivated in China for its small, fragrant flowers which at Peking appear in August in great profusion in the axils of the leaves. The flowers are white or reddish brown. It is commonly called \u6842\u82b1 kui hua or Cassia flowers. It is known by the same name at Canton. A good drawing of the plant is found in Ch. [XXXIII, 10] under yen kui.\n\nMartini [in his Atlas sinensis, published about 230 years ago] reports that the city of \u6842\u6797\u5e9c Kui lin fu, the capital of Kwangsi, derives its name (city of the kui forests) from\nthe abundance of this tree in the neighbourhood. [See my Early Europ. Res. Bot. China, 12.] I suspect that the k\u00fcn kui mentioned in the Li sao may refer to Olea fragrans rather than to Cassia bark.\n\nSiebold, Syn. plant. \u00e6c\u0153u. jap., 139:\u2014Cinnamomum Cassia, Nikko, \u6842.

Legge translates this passage:\u2014The cold waters issuing variously from the spring do not soak the fire-wood I have cut. Legge, who follows one of the Chinese commentators, takes \u7a6b\u85aa to mean fire-wood that has been cut down. But most of the commentators say that the first character denotes a tree. Cheng Huan and Kung Ying-ta refer to the Rh ya [235] huo or lo.\n\nLu ki:\u2014The huo is now called \u6930\u6986 ye yu (cocoa-nut elm, unknown to me). The leaves resemble those of the elm. Its bark is strong and supple. The people strip it off in pieces several feet long, and twist it into ropes. Of the wood, drinking-vessels can be made.\n\nThe dictionary Yu pien [6th century] says that the huo is the same as \u6930\u6728 hua mu. Ch., XXXVII, 41.\nThe birch is a common tree in the more elevated mountains of Northern China. The people call it hua.

It is also called \u9748\u58fd\u6728 l\u012bng shou mu (the tree of longevity). The people employ it for whip-handles and hones. It grows plentifully in the northern mountains of \u5b8f\u8fb2 Hung umng (in Honan).\n\nP., XXXVI, 75:\u2014Ling shou mu, or k\u016b, also \u6276\u8001\u6756 ju lao chang (walking-staff for old men). The first name dates from the time of the Han dynasty. In the Han History, in the biography of \u5b54\u5149 Kung Kuang, a high dignitary, it is stated that after he had been ill the empress bestowed upon him a staff of longevity to lean on when going to court. Yen Shih-ku [of the T'ang dynasty] who commented upon the T'sien Han-shu, says that this plant is like the bamboo, having joints, and is not more than 8 or 9 feet high, the stem 3 or 4 inches in circumference, fit, as it grows, for walking-sticks without any cutting or forming.\n\nV. supra, 249.\n355.\u2014\u6a39 Tshuy. This tree is repeatedly mentioned in the Shan hai king. Kro P'o describes it as a tree growing to a height of 30 feet; it is branchless. The leaves are at the end of a common stalk and form a circle [the author means to describe a fan-shaped palm-leaf]. The bark of the trunk forms joints and is useful for making ropes [the author speaks of the sheaths of the bases of the leaves, which cover the trunk]. It is also called \u68d5\u6a39 ping lu.\n\nThe Shuo wen likewise identifies the tsuag with the ping lu. The tree here spoken of is a palm, the Chamaerops Fortunei, Lindl., which is very common in Middle and Southern China. The coir furnished by it is largely manufactured into cloaks and hats.\n\nP., XXXVb, 39:\u2014Tsung lu. The author Su Sung [11th century] gives a characteristic description of this palm. Among other peculiarities he notes that its leaves form a circle and resemble a wheel with spokes, and that its bunches of yellowish white flowers resemble fish-roe.\n\nCh. Fortunei is closely allied to the Japanese Ch. excelsa, Thbg. Perhaps it is the same.\n\nAmara, crot., 898:\u2014\u6a39\u6a39 suco et sodio, Palm\u00e6 Malabaricae codda panna dict\u00e6 (Corypha umbraculifera) affinis, folio minori; hoc caelo sterilis et ob ornatum culta.

The Shan hai king says that its fruit resembles the \u6797\u679c (Melia). Kuo P'o adds that it is also called \u7c21\u6a38\u6728 kien k'ien muo. The fruit (or seed) is \u6307\u982d\u767d chi t'ou pai (finger's white). It is glutinous and employed for washing clothes.

In the\nseventh or eighth month its panicles are formed, and then it exudes a substance like salt in appearance, which is of a pleasant taste.\n\n563.\u2014\u7af9 Chu in ancient times was a general name for Bamboos as in our days. The character is of frequent occurrence in the classical writings. It appears that in the classical period the bamboo was just as indispensable a plant to the Chinese in domestic economy and applied to the same variety of purposes as nowadays. Besides this, in early days, before paper was invented, the Chinese wrote on bamboo tablets (\u7c21 kien). Bamboo-sprouts were used as food [c. supra, 373]. The wood of the bamboo cut into splints was woven into mats, baskets or hats.\n\n\u7b75 Yen, a bamboo mat spread on the ground, and on which they sat in early times at feasts; repeatedly mentioned in the Shu king [395, 473, 487]. \u7c2a Tien, a mat of fine bamboo work.

Shi king, 308, 604.\n\nMany of the Chinese musical instruments were made of bamboo. Li ki, I, 120; Chou li, I, 407, II, 60, 61; Chun ts'iu, 300, 301; Shi king, 356.

Ch., XXXV, 67; Kin huang, LVI, 18.\n\n564.\u2014Besides the general name for the bamboo, chu, there appear in the Chinese Classics some other names referring to peculiar sorts of bamboo.\n\nIn the Shu k'yu [108, \"Tribute of Y\u00fc,\" Province of \u694a\u5dde Yang chou (present Chekiang, Kiangsu, Anhui)] we read:\u2014After the waters of the marsh of Chin (supposed to answer to the Tailin) had been settled, the bamboos, small and large, then spread about. The Chinese text has \u7bcc siao and \u7be4 tang. Kuang An-kuo explains tang by \u5927\u7af9, large bamboo, and siao by \u7af9\u7bad, bamboo good for arrows. Kuang Ying-ta says a small bamboo.\n\nThe R\u00fc ya [43] identifies tang with \u7af9. Li S\u00fcn explains:\u2014A bamboo whose joints are 10 feet apart. Rh ya, 174, siao identified with \u7be4 [see farther on].\n\nThe dictionary Tsi yun [Sung dynasty] notices that there was in ancient \u912d Ye a river Tang which derived its name from the tang bamboo. This river has still the same name. The city of Tang yin hien [Northern Honan, Chang te fu] is situated on it.\n\nThe Chu pu, a treatise on bamboos [3rd or 4th century], states that the siao bamboo is produced in \u912d Lu on the \u912d\u5c71 Tsou mountain, and that it is used for making musical\ninstruments (\u7b19\u7ba1). The Tsou shan was evidently in the district of Tson hien (Shantung, Yen chou fu).\n\nIn the Chou li [11, 266, 267] we read:\u2014La province de Yang teheou produit des bambous de la grande et de la petite esp\u00e8ce. The Chinese text has \u7af9 chu and \u7bad tsien. Cheng Huan says that these terms correspond to tang and shao in the Yu kung.\n\n\u7bad Tsien properly means an arrow. This meaning is also given to it in the Shuo wen. But in ancient times this name was also applied to a small bamboo, the stem of which was suitable for making arrows.\n\nIn the Shua hai king, tsien is generally coupled with chu, as in the Chou li [l.c.] and in the Li ki, [1, 305 \"Yue ting\"]:\u2014Second month of winter. When the shortest day has arrived, they fell trees and carry away bamboos and [especially] the small species suitable for arrows (\u7af9\u7bad). Ibidem, II, 53 [\"Mourning Rites\"] :\u2014The hair-pin of the arrow-bamboo (\u7bad\u7b0b) was worn by an unmarried daughter for her father to the end of the three years' mourning. Ibidem, I, 26:\u2014Arrows and wood for bows. [See above, 502].\n\nThe Kth yu [174] identifies the tsien and the shao. The Fang yen states that tsien is the name usual in Kuan si (Shensi), whilst in \u6c5f\u6dee Kiang huai (Chekiang, Anhui) it is called \u7b77 tsien.\n\nAccording to the Chu pu (treatise on bamboos), the tsien does not grow higher than 10 feet. Its joints are 3 feet apart. It is very hard and strong, suitable for making arrows. It is abundantly produced in Kiangnan. The best comes from \u970d\u7a3d Hui ki (Shao hing fu, Chekiang).\n\n\u7b1b K\u00fcn and \u9f13 lu are two kinds of bamboo mentioned in the Shu king [112, \"Tribute of Yii\"] as produced in the province of \u8346\u5dde King chon (Hubei). Kung An-kuo defines k\u00fcn and lu by \u7f8e\u7af9 (excellent bamboos); Cheng\nH\u00dcAN by large and small bamboos. The Chu pu says that k\u00fcn and lu are two names; the k\u00fcn and the lu are black bamboos, good for arrows. The first is also mentioned in the Shan hai king. The name lu, according to the Shuo wen, is also written \u9732 lu.\n\nSeveral other ancient names for bamboos are met with in the Shan hai king.\n\n\u7b46\u7af9 Kui chu, also written \u6842\u7af9 kui chu. The Shan hai king says it is very poisonous. Kuo Po explains that this bamboo grows in the district of \u6842\u967d Kui yang (in Southern Hunan). It is 40 feet high and 1 foot in circumference.\n\n\u6276\u7af9 Fu chu. Kuo Po says it is the same as the \u7b14\u7af9 kiuang, a bamboo with high (distant) joints; the culm is solid (not hollow); it is fit for walking-sticks, whence the name \u6276\u8001\u7af9 fu luo chu (bamboo for an old man to lean on).\n\n\u7c6c Mei, a bamboo repeatedly mentioned in the Shan hai king. Kuo Po says:\u2014This bamboo now grows in \u6f22\u4e2d Han chung (Southern Shensi); it is thick inside, the joints are distant. Its sprouts, which come out in winter, are eaten by the people. [Comp. supra, 373].\n\nSee also the bamboos mentioned in the Rh ya [169-174].\n\nThat is all we know regarding the bamboos mentioned in the ancient Chinese records. Most of those ancient names have most probably disappeared for a long time from the Chinese language.\n\n565.\u2014A. Riviere, in his admirable monograph on bamboos [Les Bambous; Paris, 1879] notices 23 species of the tribe Bambuseae (genera Bambusa, Arundinaria, Phyllostachys) known to our botanists as coming from China, for the greater part from Canton and Hongkong. But the number of distinct species of bamboos growing in China is, no doubt, much larger. Phyllostachys nigra, Munro, Ph. bambusoides, S. & Z., Bam- busa nana, Roxbg., B. dumetorum, Hance, are dwarf species\nfound in China. *Ph. nigra* has a black stem. Perhaps this is the *k'\u00fcn* or the *lu* of the *Shu king*. At Canton, this black bamboo, attaining not more than a man's height, is cut down for walking-sticks and handles of parasols. Of tall Chinese species there is the common Indian *Bambusa arundinacea*, Retz (*Arundo Bambos*, L.) and the *Bambusa tuldaoides*, Munro, both cultivated at Canton. Bamboos of great dimensions are said to grow in Chekiang [they were noticed there by Marco Polo, 600 years ago. Yule's edition, II, 203]:\u2014\u201cThe largest and longest canes that are in all Manzi; they are full four palms in girth and 15 paces in length.\u201d The provinces of Hupei and Sz'ch'\u00fcan are likewise famed for their large bamboos. Baron Richthofen, in one of his *Letters on the Interior Provinces of China*, remarks that nowhere in China does the bamboo attain such a size as in Sz'ch'\u00fcan.\n\nDr. Legge [*Shu king*, 109] doubts the correctness of the Chinese statements regarding solid bamboos. European botanists, however, know several bamboos with solid (not hollow) stems. [See Rivi\u00e8re, l.c., 24; Loureiro, *Flora cochin.*, 72]. *Arundo* (*Bambusa*) agrestis (of Southern China): internodiis brevibus, intus parum vacuis, saepe integre solidis. The stem of *Bambusa spinosa*, Roxbg., in India has a very small cavity.\n\nOne of the Chinese bamboos, the sprouts of which are used for food, is, according to Rivi\u00e8re [l.c., 231] the *Phyllostachys mitis* (*Bambusa mitis*, Poir., *Arundo mitis*, Lour.). It is also known in Europe under the name of *Bambusa edulis*.\n\nMany kinds of bamboo are also found in Japan, but as bamboos flower and fruit only once in from 30 to 60 years, the botanical names of the Japanese species have only partly been ascertained.\nAm\u00e6n. exot., 898:\u2014\u7af9 Tsiku, vulgo tacke et fatsku.

According to M\u00e8ne [Productions v\u00e9g\u00e9tales du Japon, 1885, p. 28, 182], the bamboos whose sprouts are eaten in Japan are the moso, the madake [v. supra, No. 17], the ofetchiku, the hatchiku and the metake [18]. Of these the moso and the madake are of large size and employed for making various domestic utensils. Perhaps the moo soo is the Bambusa edulis or Phyllostachys mitis [Rivi\u00e8re, l.c., 231], which is known in China to furnish edible sprouts. Its large stem is snaked. In Algeria, where it is cultivated, it attains a height of nearly 50 feet.\n\n25:\u2014B. hatsik. Edulis, atque pro baculis ad equitandum.

It is good for walking-sticks, but the sprouts are not good for eating.\n\nInteresting details regarding the square bamboo of Wen chou fu, communicated by Dr. Macgowan, are found in the\nNorth-China Herald, 1882, p. 306.

This is the Bambusa kumasasa, Zoll., Franchet & Savatier. l.c., II, 184. But Phyllostachys bambusoides, S. & Z., is likewise called kumasasa by the Japanese. Franchet & Savatier, l.c., II, 182. Under the Chinese name \u7bac jo, P. [XV, 75] describes a plant of Southern China which has the appearance of a small bamboo. The young shoots resemble those of reeds. The leaves are dark green, but pale on the under side, soft and fresh at all seasons of the year. The people in the south make hats of them; they are used also for wrapping up tea, salt and balls of cooked glutinous rice. Women put them in the soles of shoes. W.D. [296] calls this bamboo Bambusa latifolia, an arbitrary identification, for B. latifolia is a species from tropical America. According to the Shuo wen, jo properly means the skin of the bamboo.\n\n33.\u2014Bambusa ginmei sasa.

[LXXX, 26] gives a short account of it. See also K.D. The \u6fdf\u5357\u8349\u6728\u8b5c Huai nan ts'ao mu pu [K.D. writes \u6fdf\u5357\u5b50\u8349\u6728\u8a13, and it would therefore seem that it is a treatise on the plants mentioned in the Huai nan tz', 2nd century B.C.] states that the k'iai tree grows on the grave of K'ung tsz'. It is a sort of \u680e tso (oak). Its trunk and branches are straight, not crooked; it has a durable wood. The Shuo wen says that the k'iai is a tree on the grave of Confucius. The Yu yang tsa tsu [9th century] says:\u2014In Shu (Sz'ch'uan) is a tree which resembles the tso (an oak). It withers when all the other trees are in blossom, and thrives in winter, and gives shade. The people of Shu call it k'iai mu. In the Shantung t'ung chi we read that the k'iai mu, which grows on the grave of K'ung tsz' has a finely grained wood suitable for chess-boards and lances. The young leaves may be eaten as a vegetable, they are also employed like tea. An oil is expressed from the seeds and used for plasters. Of the excrescences of the tree drinking-cups can be made.\n\nIn 1873 Dr. J. Edkins visited the grave of Confucius near the city of \u66f2\u961c K'\u00fc fou hien in the prefecture of Yen chou fu, Shantung. In a paper devoted to this visit, and published in the Journal N.C.B.R.A. Soc. [VIII, 82] he states:\u2014The grave of Confucius is about 20 feet high and 100 feet in circuit. On it grow pines, acacias and a tree called, from the shining brillancy of its leaves, shui tsing shu (crystal tree). Dr. Edkins transmitted to me a branch of this tree, with long, pinnate, shining leaves. They proved to belong to Pistacia chinensis, Bge., a handsome tree met with also in the Peking mountains.\nThere is yet another tree mentioned by early writers as growing on the grave of Confucius. In the *Shi ki* or Historical Records collected by Sz' ma T'an in the 2nd century B.C., in an account of Confucius' lineage, there is a notice stating that on the grave of the sage grows the \u6a1f\u6a39\u4e4b\u6a39 ch' an t'an tree. Regarding t'an [v. supra, 540], Sz' Ma Siang Ju [\u2020 B.C. 126] in his poem *Shang lin yu an fu*, says that the ch' an t'an, is the same as the \u6728\u862d mu lan, which latter name is now applied to a Magnolia. [V. supra, 551. See also K.D.]\n\n567.\u2014\u6a21 Mu. The above-mentioned *Huai nan ts'ao mu pu*, which speaks of the k'iai tree growing on the grave of Confucius, reports that on the grave of \u5468\u516c Chou kung grows the mu, a tree whose leaves are green in spring, red in summer, white in autumn and black in winter. [See K.D.]\n\nChou kung, the famous Duke of Chon, the younger brother of Wu Wang, the founder of the Chon dynasty, died in B.C. 1105, and was buried in Peih, near the present Si an fn (Shensi). [See Legge's *Shu king*, 535.]\n\n568.\u2014We read in the *Li sao*, [34]:\u2014Les guides de mon attelage ont \u00e9t\u00e9 attach\u00e9es aux branches du *fu sang* (\u6276\u6851). J'ai pris un rameau de l'arbre *jo* (\u82e5\u6728) pour l'opposer au soleil.\n\n*Fu sang* was the name of a fabulous tree behind which the sun was supposed to rise. It is also mentioned in Tung Fang-so's *Shi chou ki* [2nd century B.C.] and other ancient works. The *Shan hai king* writes \u6a39\u6728 fu mu. Kuo P'o explains it by \u6276\u6851. [See also my article \"Das Land Fu sang,\" in Mitheil. d. Deutschen Gesellsch. f. Natur- u. V\u00f6lkerkunde Ostasiens; Yokohama, Heft 11, 1876.\n\nIn Chinese botanical works the name *fu sang* is applied to *Hibiscus Rosa sinensis*, L., a beautiful ornamental shrub\ncultivated in Southern China. *P.*, XXXVI, 45. *Ch.*, XXXV, 58.

FABER.\n\nNEW JAPANESE BOTANICAL WORKS.\n\nAs Dr. Bretschneider refers only to older Japanese identifications, the student will receive great advantage from comparing the latest, and probably best, Japanese identifications by J. Matsumura, supervised by R. Yatabe, Tokyo, 1884. As there was not room enough in the notes, all the rest of the Chinese and corresponding scientific names, according to Matsumura, will be found in the Appendix. I had some difficulty and several months delay in procuring Matsumura's work in Shanghai, hence reference to it could only be made from p. 35 of this publication. During a short visit to Tokyo I found some other useful Japanese works bearing on this subject:\n\nA Catalogue of Plants in the Herbarium of the College of Science, Imperial University; Tokyo, 1886.\n\nThe arrangement follows the natural orders without any alphabetical convenience. The Chinese names agree, with a few exceptions, with Matsumura's. There are, however, a few more Chinese names. Plants not indigenous are distinguished by smaller type.\n\nTabula Ordinum Plantarum Naturalium, by Manaby Miyoshi; Tokyo, 1888.\n\nThis is a useful sheet of the names of all the natural orders in Latin, Chinese and Japanese. The Phanerogams are classified according to Bentham and Hooker, the Cryptogams according to Geibel's Grundz\u00fcge der Systematik.\n\nA Glossary of the Botanical Terms; Tokyo, 1891.\n\nA Text-Book of Botany, 2 Vols.\n\n\u751f\u85ac\u5b66. 2 Vols.

Description, etc., is in Japanese.\nGENERAL REMARKS.\n\n\u8349\u6728\u82b1\u5be6\u5beb\u771f\u5716\u8b5c. 4 Vols. Colored drawings of plants. Japanese and Chinese names. The scientific names are defective. Short descriptions in Japanese.\n\nAUTHORITIES FOR CHINESE IDENTIFICATIONS.\n\nWe regret that the Japanese authors do not state the authorities for their Chinese identifications. If we knew only of Matsumura's excellent vocabulary the impression would be unavoidable that all Japanese and Chinese writers are in perfect agreement on every point. The quotations given by Dr. Bretschneider compared with the Notes by Dr. Faber reveal the real state of things. Some Chinese names of plants not indigenous to Japan have been applied to other species and even to other genera in Japan. A large number of Chinese names are not confined to one species only, in China, but are applied to different plants in different localities and by different authors. One and the same plant also bears several names in books as well as among the people. This is even the rule, with very few exceptions. We cannot avoid confusion, if this fact is ignored.\n\nThe best method will be to take the Chinese geographical works as the basis for determining the best Chinese names. There is one voluminous geographical-statistical record for each province, and most of the prefectures have a more detailed work of their own, called \u5e9c\u5fd7, commonly also in many volumes. The chapter on \"produce,\" \u7269\u7523, contains the names of all plants known within the prefecture, and the information given under each name is the most reliable that can be gleaned from Chinese sources. Wherever procurable, a comparison with separate works on districts, \u7e23\u5fd7, will be of advantage.\n\nCHINESE DRAWINGS OF PLANTS.\n\nTwo or more drawings of distinct plants are sometimes given under one name. Very few of the figures in the Imperial Encyclopedia are drawings from nature, but most are copies of earlier copies, which were copies of other copies. It is not surprising, therefore, that many figures appear more or less disfigured. The authors were commonly more familiar with books than with nature, and the block-cutters had no understanding of either. In comparing a common later edition of the Pen tsao with the photo-lithographed\nreprint of one dated 1657, the student will be struck with the contrast. It shows the importance of tracing the original editions of plates. This is no easy task in China. Editions of the Ming period are already rare and expensive; those of the Sung and T'ang periods are, as a rule, beyond the reach of ordinary mortals. The expression \"a good figure\" must not mislead the reader. None of the Chinese drawings exhibit botanical details. The best figures are mere outlines, but are recognisable when the plant is known. The greater number of inferior figures might belong to a dozen and more distinct plants.\n\nChinese Names.\n\nThe Chinese have never shown any inclination for exploring nature from a love of knowledge. No trace can be found of a scientific tendency in all they have written on plants. They have named many plants, only because they could not do otherwise. Named among the ten thousand Chinese plants are such only as are in use among the people and which were in use long before a name was thought of.\n\nThe peculiar names of the Rh ya given in explanation of more ancient names point probably to different languages. A comparison with the philological statements of the Fang yen [vide this Journal Vol. XVI, p. 145, No. 106] might lead to a determination of their respective localities. The difficulty, however, of fixing the ancient pronunciation of the respective written characters must not be overlooked. We are dependent on modern analogies. The explanation of ancient names, already obsolete 2,000 years ago, is mere guess-work without value. Most of Kuo P'o's remarks belong to this kind.\n\nThough it is of scientific interest to find out the botanical determination of ancient names, it is not less of scientific interest, and of considerable practical value, to determine every kind of material from the vegetable kingdom used in China at present and to verify the names employed in authoritative modern Chinese works, especially in the Pen ts'ao.\n\nAncient Names.\n\nThe following almost complete list of Chinese names of plants which have remained unchanged from ancient classical times will be of interest to the student.\nAncient Names still in Use.\n\n[The Nos. refer to Dr. Bretschneider's Nos. in this volume.]\n\n7.\u2014\u5317 shu, Atractylis.\n13, 431.\u2014\u84bf hao, Artemisia annua.\n15, 436.\u2014\u84ec peng, Erigeron.\n42.\u2014\u7b0b s\u00fcn, Bamboo-sprout.\n45.\u2014\u83f4 ni, Adenophora.\n64.\u2014\u8607 su, Perilla.\n77, 429.\u2014\u827e ai, Artemisia vulg.\n99, 395.\u2014\u8377 ho, Nelumbium.\n113.\u2014\u840d ping, Water-plant (Monochoria) [V. 400]\n114, 400.\u2014\u860b pin, Marsilea.\n116, 370.\u2014\u82b9 kin, Enanthe.\n124, 397.\u2014\u83f1 ling, Trapa.\n162.\u2014\u83cc k\u00fcn, Mushroom.\n185, 377.\u2014\u8568 kue, Pteris aquilina.\n210, 455.\u2014\u8466 wei, Phragmites.\n227, 473.\u2014\u6885 mei, Prunus Mume.\n236, 487.\u2014\u67da yu, Citrus decumana.\n252, 523.\u2014\u694a yang, Populus.\n257, 526.\u2014\u675e ki, Lycium.\n261.\u2014\u6953 feng, Liquidambar.\n272, 484.\u2014\u68d7 tsao, Jujube.\n289, 546.\u2014\u69d0 huai, Sophora.\n301, 481.\u2014\u68a8 li, Pyrus.\n304, 528.\u2014\u6986 yu, Ulmus.\n328, 499.\u2014\u6851 sang, Morus.\n328, 524.\u2014\u67f3 liu, Salix.\n337.\u2014\u7a3b tao, Oryza, Rice.\n339.\u2014\u9ea5 mai, Triticum, Hordeum.\n341.\u2014\u9ecd, \u7a57, Panicum miliaceum.\n355.\u2014\u83fd shu, Leguminos\u00e6.\nGENERAL REMARKS.\n\n357.\u2014\u8471 ts'ung, Allium fistulosum.\n362.\u2014\u82a5 kiai, Brassica sinapis.\n368.\u2014\u8475 k'ui, Malva, etc.\n371.\u2014\u5807 kin, Viola.\n375.\u2014\u84b2 p'u, Typha.\n376.\u2014\u83d6 ch'ang, Acorus.\n378.\u2014\u8587 wei, Osmunda.\n380.\u2014\u829d chi, Fungus.\n381.\u2014\u8591 kiang, Ginger (Alpinia).\n382.\u2014\u74dc kua, (Melon) Cucurbitaceae.\n384.\u2014\u74e0 hu, \u85e4 p'ao, Lagenaria.\n388.\u2014\u9ebb ma, Hemp, Cannabis, etc.\n390.\u2014\u845b ko, Pueraria Thunbergiana.\n391.\u2014\u6b16 chu, Baphmeria.\n392.\u2014\u84dd lan, Polygonum tinctorium.\n396.\u2014\u82a1 k'ien, Euryale.\n399.\u2014\u8377 hing, Limnanthemum.\n401.\u2014\u85fb ts'ao, Ceratophyllum, etc.\n403.\u2014\u828d\u836f sho yo, Paonia albiflora.\n404.\u2014\u83ca k\u00fc, Chrysanthemum.\n410.\u2014\u82b7 chi, Angelica.\n413.\u2014\u85c1\u672c kao pen, Nothosmyrnium jap.\n422.\u2014\u534a\u590f pan hia, Pinellia.\n428.\u2014\u8457 shi ?\n446.\u2014\u85dc li, Chenopodium.\n447.\u2014\u82a9 k'in, Scutellaria.\n453.\u2014\u8513 lien, Vitis.\n455.\u2014\u82a6 lu, Phragmites.\n459.\u2014\u8305 mao, Imperata.\n470.\u2014\u6843 r'ao, Peach.\n472.\u2014\u674f hing, Apricot.\n472.\u2014\u674e li, Prunus domestica.\n478.\u2014\u6728\u74dc mu kua, Cydonia.\n485.\u2014\u68d8 ki, Zizyphus (wild).\nGENERAL REMARKS.\n\n486.\u2014\u6a58 k\u016b, Orange.\n488.\u2014\u67b3 chi, Citrus fusca?\n489.\u2014\u6907 h\u016b, Hovenia.\n491.\u2014\u67ff sh\u012b, Diospyros.\n494.\u2014\u6817 li, Castanea.\n496.\u2014\u699b chen, Corylus.\n497.\u2014\u6912 tsiao, Zanthoxylon.\n501.\u2014\u6822 che, Cudrania.\n503.\u2014\u7a40 hu, Broussonetia.\n504.\u2014\u677e sung, Pinus, etc.\n505.\u2014\u67cf po, Thuja.\n512.\u2014\u6960 or \u6960 nan, Machilus.\n513.\u2014\u6a1f or \u6a1f chang, Camphor.\n515.\u2014\u6850 tung, Paulownia.\n516.\u2014\u68a7 wu, Sterculia platanifolia.\n517.\u2014\u6f06 ts'i, Rhus vernicifera.\n518.\u2014\u6a3a ch'u, Ailanthus.\n521.\u2014\u834a king, Vitex.\n527.\u2014\u6a89 ch'eng, Tamarix.\n531.\u2014\u6a38 p'o, Celtis.\n534.\u2014\u6a38, \u67d8 li, tso, Quercus.\n550.\u2014\u862d lan, Magnolia.\n553.\u2014\u6842 ku\u012b, Cinnamomum.\n555.\u2014\u6a2b tsung, Chamarops.\n563.\u2014\u7af9 chu, Bamboo.\n\nConspicuous in this list is the large number of trees, fruit-trees as well as timber-trees, and the absence of powerful medicines. Does this fact indicate that it was not the Chinese who found out the important use of poisonous plants in medicine, but that they were taught such use by foreigners, and afterwards discovered plants, indigenous to China, possessing similar qualities?\n\nDISCREPANCIES EXPLAINED.\n\nThe discrepancies between the figures and descriptions of Chinese publications, ancient and modern, as also of books in general and\npresent mercantile usage, can be explained in a simple way. Though some knowledge of drugs and their use has been universal in China, a good number of the corresponding medicinal plants were never known to any but a few collectors of plants. They kept their knowledge as a secret by which they gained their profits. As it might happen that the few expert collectors vanished in times of war or through other calamities, their secret perished with them. Other persons tried afterwards, with more or less success, to repair the loss. If the effects of their drugs were found similar to those lost, the differences (appearance and former description) would be overlooked. It might also happen that the supply became exhausted, through extermination of the plant, at one particular locality or in general. The nearest substitute had then to take its place. Moreover, attempts were often made to introduce a cheaper drug from the neighbourhood for an expensive one from a distance, and in many cases with success. It would happen, too, that a drug found to be of a similar but better effect would displace another long known, and probably receive the recognized old name. Dishonesty on the part of those concerned in the trade had, of course, a considerable share in the causes of the present confusion. Inadequate botanical knowledge made exposure almost impossible. New names were also started, partly by misprints and insufficient knowledge of the written characters among practitioners, partly by the differences of pronunciation in different parts of China.\n\nChinese Classification.\n\nThough the Chinese have written many volumes on plants, during a time of more than two thousand years, and have accumulated between three and four thousand names of plants (including synonyms), they have never made an attempt toward a scientific treatment of botany. Their descriptions are vague and often contradictory, commonly useless except the plant be already known. All attempts at classification are on the basis of usage, not founded on botanical properties.\n\nThe various names given in the Imperial Encyclopedia at the head of each family, sometimes in great number, and called synonyms in my notes for brevity's sake, are in many cases names given to distinct plants by other Chinese authors, sometimes even to plants of different orders, but commonly to other species of the same genus, to other genera of the same order, or to plants of the same usage.\nGENERAL REMARKS.\n\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION.\n\nChina has not yet been satisfactorily explored by botanists. Well known are only the regions around Peking, Chefoo, Canton, Shanghai, Ningpo, Kiukiang, I-chang, Omei Mountain, Ncwchwang, Moukden, and Long White Mountain. Though plants have been collected from other parts of China, this has been done only episodically, not as an exploration of the whole field. We may boldly say that hundreds of undescribed plants can still be found in China. As long as exploration is not nearer completion, we cannot expect an accurate knowledge of the geographical distribution of plants in China. We do not even know the limits of the spontaneous growth of bamboo, nor of the cultivation of rice, of the mulberry tree to rear silkworms, of the peach, citrus, etc. The table in *Planta Davidiana*, Vol. II, wherein Moupine, Kiangsi, Shensi, S. Mongolia and Peking are put in parallel columns, the *Index Flora Sinensis*, which is more comprehensive, but only about one-half published, and a *List of Chinese Medicines*, published by order of the Inspector General of Customs, where the place of production is (approximately) stated, are valuable contributions in this line. Much valuable information might be gleaned from the Chinese geographical works already referred to.\n\nSome Chinese authors venture farther and mention the place where the plant originally came from. We may take this in the sense of the first discovery of the plant or that its use spread from the place mentioned. See, for example, *San ts'ai tu huci* (quoted = S.). The botanical portion of this encyclopedia is by \u738b\u601d\u7fa9, the second son of WANG K'IE \u738b\u573b [v Wylie, 56, 149].\n\nA DESIDERATUM.\n\nIndispensable to every botanist in China is the *Index Flora Sinensis*, a work of great merit, published by F. B. FORBES and W. B. HEMSLEY at Kew. It appears in portions and is progressing very slowly. We may, however, soon expect Vol. II finished. This brings us to the end of *Dicotyledons*. Vol. III will have to deal with *Monocotyledons* and *Cryptogams*. Another volume is required to supplement the first two. This work is not restricted to a mere dry enumeration of the scientific names of all the Chinese plants known. Reference is made to every description and illustration of a plant in botanical works. The geographical distribution is mentioned, as regards China, for Chili,\nManchuria, Shantung, Kiangsu, Chekiang, Fokien, Formosa, Pesadores, Kuangtung, Hongkong, Hainan, Yunnan, Szechuan, Kansuh, Hupeh, Kiangsi; and as regards other countries, for Corea, Japan, Luchu Islands, Siberia, India, etc. This is most valuable information. One of the greatest merits of the Index, however, is the reduction of a large number of synonymic, or else useless, determinations. For example, *Rhododendron indicum*, Sw., is now relieved of 25 botanical names. Descriptions are confined to new species and to a few new genera. As no key is given to the Chinese genera of each order and to the species mentioned in the Index, and no complete botanical library is available in China, this work cannot assist to determine any plant unknown to us, though it may be mentioned in the book. The aim of the Index is another. We need along with it a short *Handbook of Chinese Botany*, or Bentham's *Flora Hongkongensis* enlarged to *A Flora Sinensis*. Introductory matter could be reduced and description be made as short and characteristic as possible.\n\nClassification will remain partly unsatisfactory till all plants of the globe are known and time can be given to closer observation and more minute investigation of every species in a genus and of every genus in an order. Soil, elevation, moisture, light and air in their innumerable differences and varying combinations are so many conditions which modify the typical form of a plant. Cultivation has shown the great extent of variation in some species. Observation of wild species is limited. Many differences, now regarded as sufficient to establish a distinct species, may mark only variations. Genera, too, with only one or two species attached to their fame and fate, will be recognized by a critical specialist as extreme forms of some older genera. Very few of the Chinese species are in every respect identical with specimens of the same species in Europe or America. The present difficulties of determining plants in China would be considerably removed if the above-mentioned Desideratum could be realised.\nAPPENDIX.\n\nChinese Names of Plants, identified in Japan, classified under their Natural Orders and arranged alphabetically.\n\nACANTHACEAE.\u2014\u6c34\u8475\u79d1.\n\nJap., 796, Dicliptera Buergeriana, Miq., \u4e5d\u982d\u7be9\u5b50\u8349.\n,, 1116, Hygrophila lancea, Miq., \u6c34\u8475\u79d1.\nJusticia procumbens, L., \u820c\u72c0.\n,, 1925, Rostellularia procumbens, Nees, \u9bfd\u9b5a\u9c57.\n,, 2158, Strobilanthes oliganthus, Miq., \u7d2b\u96f2\u83dc.\n\nALISMACEAE.\u2014\u6fa4\u6cfb\u79d1 [Alisma, v. 437].\n\nJap., 1962, Sagittaria sagittifolia, L. \u6148\u59d1.\n\nAMARANTACEAE.\u2014\u83a7\u79d1.\n\nJap., 40, Achyranthes bidentata, Bl., var. japonica, Miq., \u725b\u819d.\n,, 125, Amaranthus caudatus, L., \u8001\u723a\u7a40.\n,, 126, ,, mangostanus, L., \u8396.\n,, 127, ,, melancholicus, L., var. tricolor, Lam., \u96c1\u4f86\u7d05.

It must be borne in mind that it is not a complete list of Chinese plants which is intended, but of Chinese names of plants and of their identifications in Japan. These identifications cannot yet be considered as final, but merely as tentative, till corresponding evidence has been found in China. The alphabetical arrangement of the orders will facilitate research. Time did not admit of including the names in this list in the Index of Chinese Names which follows hereafter.\n## INDEX OF CHINESE NAMES,\nREFERRED TO IN THE BOTANICON SINICUM.\n\nPrepared by Dr. E.

J. Hughes (President) in the chair. There were about\n30 persons present.\n\nIn opening the proceedings, the Chairman said that as the\nminutes of the last meeting had been already published in the\nSociety's Journal, he thought they might be taken as read. He\nhad to announce that during the past half-year the following\ngentlemen had been elected members of the Society; namely,\nMessrs. C. W. Campbell, of Seoul, Corea; Prof. E. P. Thwing, M.D.,\nof Canton; Rev. A. Elwin, of Hangchow; Prof. H. Robinson, B.A.,\nof Wuchang; J. Calder, of Port Arthur, North China; F. B.\nParkinson, A.R.S.M., of Hankow; Rev. S. A. Hunter, M.A., M.D.,\nof Tsining, Shantung; R. Kliene, of Ningpo; Rev. C. D. Bradlee,\nD.D., of Boston, Mass., U.S.A.; and the following residents of\nShanghai:\u2014Messrs. O. Franke, Ph.D.; General W. Mesny;\nF. Lemke; F. W. E. D\u00fclberg; B. R. A. Navarra; W. P. Brown;\nH. Schi\u00f6tz; and J. B. Jack. This list, the Chairman thought,\nindicated satisfactory progress, and the statement which the Honorary\nSecretary was about to make respecting the Journal of the Society\nwould, he believed, show that these publications,\u2014which, as they were\naware, members were entitled to receive free,\u2014would be at least as\nvaluable and interesting in the future as they had been in the past.\n\nThe Hon. Secretary (Mr. W. Bright) then announced that\nthe Society's Journal had been completed up to date, the last\nfascicule (No. 3) of vol. xxiv having been issued to members at the\nend of last month. The new Journal would open with a valuable\npaper\u2014the result of many years' research and of much study\u2014by a\nripe scholar, Dr. Bretschneider. It was styled \"Botany of the Chinese Classics,\" and was, in fact, a continuation of the studies condensed in a paper by the same author which appeared, under the title \"Botanicon Sinicum,\" in their Journal some ten years ago. The MS. had arrived safely from St. Petersburg, and had just been placed in the printers' hands. The paper would have the benefit of revision and annotation by Dr. Faber, a high authority on botanical subjects; and thus it would doubtless serve as an extremely valuable work of reference. It might be interesting to inform them that Dr. Bretschneider was at work on another paper, which, however, it was feared, would not be ready for some years, on \"Chinese Medicines.\" In regard to the Society's circular on \"Inland Communications,\" issued early in the year, the Secretary said that the replies received from the interior had not, on the whole, been as complete or as numerous as could have been desired. It was therefore decided to reissue the circular to those provinces from which replies had not yet come in. Some of the papers received, however, were especially valuable, chief among which might be mentioned the exhaustive monograph by the Rev. P\u00e8re Havret on the province of Anhwei, accompanied by two maps; a paper by Mr. Chr. Jensen on the Y\u00fcnnan province, also accompanied by three maps of routes over which he had personally travelled in laying the telegraph line of the Imperial Chinese Telegraph Administration; and a paper by Mr. George Graham Brown on the province of Kansu, with some valuable notes on the Bridge of Boats (800 feet long) at Lanchow. In all, the replies received might be summarised thus: 5 papers from Y\u00fcnnan [it would seem that the most distant parts were the earliest to send in the information desired], 4 from Kiangsu, 3 each from Kansuh and Shensi, 2 each from Chihi and Anhwei, 1 each from Southern Formosa, Kwangtung (Pakhoi), Honan, Shansi, Hainan, Kwangsi and Mongolia. They were much indebted to those who had already favoured them with information, and there could be no doubt that should their anticipations in regard to obtaining further information be realised, the series of papers, when edited and prepared for publication by Mr. W. R. Carles (who had the work now in hand) would form a most valuable addition to their limited knowledge of the\nroads (ancient and modern) and their condition, trade routes, modes and cost of travelling and of conveyance of goods and accommodation for travellers, and noteworthy bridges, viaducts, etc., throughout China; the work might ultimately lead to the publication of a much-needed map of the highways and trade routes in the interior. It would, he considered, be an advantage if correspondents would forward photographs of the important bridges in their province, together with brief notes of the number and span of the arches, dimensions and estimated weight of the larger blocks of stone used in the construction of the bridges. Such photographs and notes would undoubtedly impart additional interest to the subject.\n\nDr. Edkins then commenced his lecture \"China 35 Centuries Ago\" with the remark that no advantage was gained by cutting short the antiquity of civilised nations. Civilisations have usually been found after careful inquiry to be much older than was thought. The true foundations of the Chinese civilisation were laid in the third millennium before Christ, when the people taught by the sages learned their various occupations. It was at that time that the present system of government, in respect to some of the offices, commenced. Honan was the garden of China at that time, and it was there that the capital of the empire was fixed both in the Hia and in the Shang dynasties. The fertility of the land has been described by Richthoven, who compares the rich appearance of the agriculture to that of the most fertile portions of Europe. More precisely, the capital of China 35 centuries ago was Kweite Fa. Capital cities were built where the people were numerous and well-to-do\u2014made so by agriculture, so that they had a learned class and were able to maintain with their superfluous wealth as well physicians, diviners, schoolmasters and astrologers as the officers of the government military and civil. The character of the Shang dynasty (1776 to 1154 B.C.) was moral and religious as compared with the Chow period when religious usages of a more polytheistic form than before were adopted in profusion and the people in their customs deserted the simplicity of ancient life. The ancient bronzes now preserved in the imperial and private collections testify to the mechanical progress made by China at that early time. The\nmanufacture of circular vases implies the previous use of the potter's wheel. At that time the rich used cups of gold and the poor had turned wooden bowls, but rude unglazed stoneware was made. Mr. Carles has lately sent to Shanghai a rubbing of a Chow dynasty bronze kept in a temple on Silver Island. Its age is determined by Chinese archaeologists to be about B.C. 800, as is decided by the inscription of forty characters inside of the vase. The so-called tadpole writing was referred to. It seems to have been like the cuneiform in the stroke, and this circumstance may be taken as adding a certain amount of proof to the opinion that the Chinese derived the art of writing from Babylonia. The slow music and solemn religious dance of the ancient Chinese in their ceremonials accompanying the worship of heaven and of ancestors were alluded to. They remind us of the dances of the ancient Jews as referred to in the Old Testament. Towards the end of the Shang dynasty a relative of the Chow imperial family proceeded to Soochow and was the founder of the Chinese civilisation of the Soochow plain. Ki-tsz, who was a sage belonging to the imperial family of the Shang dynasty, went to Corea and there first introduced the Chinese early civilisation.\n\nAt the conclusion of Dr. Edkins' lecture, the Chairman said that the very learned and interesting lecture which they had just heard touched upon several debatable points, such as the existence of the dragon and the presence of Persian missionaries in ancient China. These would doubtless receive due attention from sinologues, and he hoped among those present there were some who would favour them with their views. The small number of ancient monuments must be one great difficulty in the study of Chinese archaeology. Unchanging as the Chinese were, and attached as they were, and had always been, if not to the homes of their ancestors, at least to their ancestral graves, they built their dwellings and even their temples for present use with small regard to posterity. Hence few traces remain in brick and mortar or in stone of the Chinese of five empires, not to speak of thirty-five centuries ago. No Herculaneum or Pompeii had been, or ever would be, found in China to bring vividly before them the everyday life of the past. For information about the period discussed they had to trust chiefly to traditions\npreserved in records of later date. They were obliged to the Rev. Dr. Edkins for the light thrown upon this obscure subject by the result of his studies as communicated in the lecture of that evening, and he had no doubt that the meeting would join with him in tendering to the learned doctor a hearty vote of thanks.\n\nThe Chairman having announced that the meeting was now open for discussion,\n\nGen. Messy said he agreed that considerable elevation of the soil of China must have taken place. He instanced a pei-lo which had been erected in the 13th century, and of which a good deal had been covered by accumulations of soil.\n\nDr. E. Faber said that it was with much interest in the subject that he followed the learned lecture of Dr. Edkins. As the discourse contained, however, many statements which were disputable, it would be impossible to enter into a detailed discussion at that moment. They all agreed that China enjoyed an ancient civilisation; they even agreed so far with Dr. Edkins as to admit that the Chow dynasty was not the beginning of mankind in China, but that other people had existed before the Chows and had managed in one way or another to live in society, or\u2014in the sense of Aristotle\u2014in political state. The astronomical data, however, referred to by Dr. Edkins were without scientific value. It had not been possible, in spite of repeated attempts made by eminent scholars and astronomers, to fix one date before 800 B.C. Stars were, of course, on the sky and people lived below the sky long before 1000 B.C., but to determine from the vague Chinese records referring to the period before 800 B.C. the exact identification of a single star, its exact position at a certain time, and even the hour of observation to which the record belonged was an impossibility. Persian influence on China at the early period of about 1700-1200 B.C. should be proved by some incontrovertible evidence, not merely by a supposed similarity of two or three ideas among hundreds which differed altogether. The same rule applied to the cuneiform writing of the Mesopotamian valley. That the tadpole characters, of which no trace was left in China, were cuneiform was a tadpole theory without the slightest historical proof. If Persian and Babylonian\nliterature had been known in China at so early a period, China must also have been known to Persia and Babylon, but not even a trace of China had been discovered in any ancient record of any country.\n\nThey were told of bronze-casting during the Shang period. But it had first to be shown that bronze was known in China at the time. The character for copper did not occur in the ancient Classics, nor even in the Four Books. The phrase \"three metals\" was found several times, but only commentators of the Han time told them that gold, silver and copper were meant, other commentaries said that it referred to three kinds of gold. Dr. Edkins told them that some bronze relics from the Shang period were still preserved, but forgot to give the evidence. That some Chinese authors said so was not sufficient reason; they needed to know on what ground the assumption was based. Dr. Edkins himself mentioned the gradual elevation of the soil in the plains of North China from an accumulation of dust ten to fifteen feet in historical times within 1,000 to 1,500 years, which was corroborated by General Mesny. They could consequently not expect any ancient bronzes to be found near to the surface. Ancient graves must now be 20 to 30 feet below the ground. Whatever was found nearer to the surface could not belong to a period B.C. He (Dr. Faber) had examined several Chinese works on antiquities and found none of them satisfactory. The Chinese had no test of any value by which to determine the age of any bronzes, even of later times. They had a theory that bronze which had been for 1,000 years in the ground assumed a blue colour, and if for 1,000 years in water a green colour. Chinese critics, however, were aware that the same colours might be produced artificially in a short time. The Silver Island bronze referred to, of which he had the pleasure of seeing a rubbing at Dr. Edkins', could not possibly belong to 800 or 900 B.C. but might be referred with more probability to the Ming period 2,000 years later. The famous Y\u00fcan Y\u00fcan, who defends its age, shows his own disqualification for judging bronzes by stating that the polished appearance of the burner was due to a peculiar composition of the bronze: No trace of atmospheric influence on this bronze for 2,700 years!\u2014Other Chinese authors are well aware of the innumerable counterfeits and\nforgeries sold as genuine in China. One Ming author told them that in his time ancient bronze was manufactured in the Shantung, Shensi and Honan provinces, at Nanking and other places. Dr. Hirth's explanation of the Chinese Meander as representing, according to a Sung writer, the ancient characters for \"cloud\" and \"thunder,\" did not prove that the ornament was known in China 2000-2500 years before that Sung writer. The duke of Chow was a famous statesman, and had for this very reason no time for writing books. He helped to establish the Chow dynasty and may have sketched the rudiments of its institution. The time before the Chow and even during the first centuries of the Chow government was not at all a period of high social and political development. Dr. Edkins referred to foreign tribes that still inhabited even the small arena of China proper at the time. The Emperors had really little or no control over the hill tribes. The Honan plain was nearly all they had really in their possession. It might be true that Kitsu, a younger brother of the founder of the Chow, went to Korea, but the real history of Korea begins a thousand years later. The plain of Soochow was more attractive and remunerative, but it was even in the time of Mencius still regarded as in a semi-barbarous state. They had also to distinguish between the Feudal states in the beginning of the Chow dynasty and the Feudal states in their highest development in China during the time of the Contending States, about 500 B.C. They might regard them, in their first stage, as quasi-independent clans under a chief each, or controlled by the head of the family. The chiefs gradually assumed the dignity, magnificence, and ceremonial of princes, but probably not before the time of the Chow. How little dignified the early rulers of China were they could learn from passages in the Classics. Yao inspired awe by dressing in a garment hanging down over his legs. Shun, Yao's son-in-law and fellow-emperor, was sent by his parents out on to the top of their hut (palace?) to repair the roof made of straw. Another time he had to go down into a well to repair it. Though of Imperial descent he worked with his own hands in the fields. There he felt his loneliness and sighed to the blue sky because his parents would not allow him to marry. The great Yu worked so\nhard in splitting the rocks of the Yangtze Gorges that his hands became callous. The people did not feel the existence of a government before the Chow; everybody did as he pleased. Dr. Edkins introduced a eulogy of Chinese ancestral worship altogether out of place. The Shang were religious more than the Chow, but ancestral worship was brought into the peculiar Chinese shape and made the basis of political government by the Chow, especially the Confucian school. That reverence of parents and continuance of genealogies through millenniums are possible without ancestral worship, with all its humbug and social evils, Dr. Edkins may learn from a look into the Bible; the Jews may serve as patterns even to the Chinese. Dr. Edkins' paper was after all very defective. Of the principal sources of comparatively reliable information about the Shang, which cannot be received from Confucian sources without great caution, Dr. Edkins seemed to have no idea whatever. He (Dr. Faber) referred to Taoism in its earliest form. Taoism was a survival of the religious, political and social life of the Shang period. As he, however, intended to write a paper on this subject, this notice must suffice for the present. They knew further that the line of the Shang rulers was continued even in the Chow period in the state of Sung. Though in the course of time many ancient usages were neglected, and Confucius thought what he found there in his time insufficient to attest antiquity, we may be able to glean something of value from the earlier records of the Sung state. It is remarkable that Mithism, i.e. Chinese Socialism, had its origin and head-quarters in Sung. Chinese bronze also required a separate paper, for which some preparation was going on.\n\nDr. Jamieson regretted that a scholar of Dr. Edkins' reputation should have believed so blindly in the authenticity of Chinese authorities. He himself had never been able to find in Chinese literature any criticism which was not of the most rapid, verbal kind. He did not think an appreciation of what we meant by criticism of history had entered into the Chinese mind. It was well known that Chinese of the literary class were always prepared with an answer, however little they might know of the subject. In proof of this he gave a reminiscence of his student days in Peking,\nwhen a number of the students amused themselves by inventing, as existing in Europe, various wonders which their Manchu teacher always asserted to have existed in China centuries before. The only thing the teacher could not credit China with was an electrical hen which laid eggs containing bacon.\n\nDr. Edkins said that some remarks in answer were required from him on account of the attack made on his opinions by some of the speakers. In regard to the possession of the critical faculty by the Chinese, it was not long after arriving in this country that he became aware of it. In a book belonging to Mr. Wylie he found a statement made that the tones of the language grow gradually and that one was added every thousand years or more. He studied the subject of tones, inquired as to the peculiarities of dialects, and found that it was as this author maintained. Since that time he had felt no doubt in regard to the critical powers of Chinese native scholars. The critical faculty was the result of education. In Europe it appeared in many persons because they had learned languages and studied logic, philosophy and grammar. In the same way in China reading many books and long-continued advantages of education produced it. Students went over a wide range of reading, and became familiar with argument, and so their critical powers were developed. One sees it in the documentary style of Chinese diplomacy. Subjects of discussion are in official documents stated with great clearness. There was no difficulty in seizing on the main idea and sense of the document. This was the result of Chinese education, which from some points of view was really a wide one, the literature of the country being very extensive. Bringing this critical faculty to the study of the sacrificial vases and other implements professing to belong to antiquity, native scholars were not likely to be easily deceived.*\n\n*The following note from Dr. Bushell of Peking was received too late to be read at the meeting:\u2014\u201cThere is a wealth of literature upon the famous tripod vase preserved in Silver Island. I have more than one special brochure, in addition to the notices in the general Archaeological Collections. Do you remember my once asking your kind intervention with Li Shen-lan, to check one of the calculations of the date from the cyclical day given in the inscription? His conclusion also was that it was correctly attributed to the time of Hs\u00fcan Wang of the Chou dynasty.\u201d\nThe improvement observable in the critical powers and intellectual attainments of the Chinese was due to the invention of printing. That led to the multiplication of books. They were found in every village and city, and of course the knowledge of the student as it increased improved his reasoning faculties. It had not been without result that the Chinese had through four dynasties printed books largely. This mode of looking at the subject was needed in judging of the antiquity of parts of their literature. They could test the results of Chinese criticism by appealing to their own science. The most ancient fragments of Chinese literature were not of a mythical kind. They do not contain such myths as are found in Livy, nor could they be rejected as the early parts of Livy were rejected. But they do contain some astronomy. The places of the stars as there given agree with the positions of those stars as now known by the law of the precession of the equinoxes. Those positions could not have been known to the Chinese except by actually observing them. Thus the stars in the sky are witnesses to the correctness of these ancient records. Since the astronomy in old Chinese literature was correct, this must be viewed as evidence favourable so far to the claims to acceptance of the narratives in which it was imbedded.\n\nThe meeting then terminated with a vote of thanks to the Chairman.\n\nMinutes of Proceedings at a General Meeting held at the Society's Library, Museum Road, Shanghai, on Monday, 6th April 1891, at 9 p.m.\n\nDr. Joseph Edkins, Vice-President, occupied the chair, and there were about twenty members present.\n\nThe Chairman having asked that the minutes of the last meeting be taken as read, as they had been so fully published in the papers, the Honorary Secretary, Mr. Mencarini, announced the election of the following new members:\u2014Messrs. Henrick Bohr, Ting I-hsien, Harold Browett, J. F. Billinghurst, E. Gerecke, Lingi Camera, J. P. Donovan, W. M. Andrew and J. Timm, of Shanghai;\nMr. Juan de Licopolis Marval, of Peking; and A. Zooyef, M.D., Naval Surgeon, Vladivostock.\n\nThe Chairman brought before the meeting a motion, proposed by Dr. Jamieson and seconded by Mr. von Molleudorff, which had been before the Committee Meeting, and which it would be necessary to confirm at the next General Meeting, to the effect that Mr. P. J. Hughes be made an Honorary Member of the Society.\n\nMr. Fraser then proceeded with the reading of his paper on the Fish-Skin Tartars, which is printed in extenso pp. 1-43 of vol. xxvi.\n\nMr. Frazer was accorded a round of hearty applause at the conclusion of his paper, after which the Chairman said they were all deeply indebted to Mr. Fraser for these very valuable translations from the Russian, which showed what they might expect to gather from Russian sources, and they were very fortunate in having a member of the Society able to translate them. The subject, the Chairman added, was now open for discussion.\n\nMr. Taylor asked why were the Orotchis called Fish-Skin Tartars.\n\nMr. Fraser replied that strictly speaking it was a name applied by the Chinese to the Goldis, to whom the Orotchis are closely allied.\n\nThe Chairman:\u2014The Orotchchi children are dressed in fish-skins. I have been looking into the accounts of the Tungusic tribes about which we have been told this evening, and to which the Manchus belong, and I find they have been minutely described by the Russians. It is a Russian account we have just heard; a new mode of conducting research in a way very suitable for our Society is thus initiated. We may gain much valuable information on the northern nations of Asia from Russian sources. The Orotchis belong to a people who, as we judge from their language, were once a great nation. The Tungusic people before the time of Christ were powerful in North China till about B.C. 200, when they were conquered by the Hsiung-nn. After a few centuries they reappeared, and acquired great political power in the sixth century. They are\nin fact the same race, as we judge by their language, with the Manchus of to-day. They are now in a state of intellectual decline, as we judge by their ethnological connection with other races observable in their vocabularies. Researches into the languages and customs of the outlying tribes of the race to which the Manchus belong are likely to give inaccurate views as to the causes of the Manchus having acquired their present power. We ask why they have been able to subdue and to hold in subjection a nation so much mightier than themselves as the Chinese? In the answer to this question we must not lose sight of the fact that they belong to a race, which during millenniums has occupied in Asia those countries we call Manchuria, and from which it has from time to time emerged to acquire a temporary political importance. The vocabularies of the Tungusic tribes contain words which show connection with the Chinese, the Japanese, the Mongol, the Turkish, etc. For instance *kedu*, wind in Goldi, is the Japanese *kaze*.\n\nMr. Taylor in proposing a vote of thanks to Mr. Fraser, which Mr. von Mollendorff seconded, referred to one or two points in the interesting paper just read. The custom which the Orotschi have, for instance of dipping their fishing-nets in reindeer's blood to preserve them, is very similar to a custom prevailing among the people of Formosa and of some parts of China, namely that of dipping new nets and lines in general in pig's blood, which keeps them from flossing. The witchcraft of the Orotschi also is very similar to that among the aborigines of Formosa.\n\nGeneral Messny and Mr. Kingsmill took part also in the discussion that followed, and the Chairman brought the proceedings to a close by saying:\u2014The Orotschi and Goldi dialects belong to the Tungusic stock, as appears on examination. A strong peculiarity in them, as in Mongol and Turkish, is that the first, second and third personal pronouns are the same as our own. \"Me\" is the first personal pronoun throughout Tartary; more than this; it is also the basis of the pronominal suffix to the verb. The verb tree is constructed by placing this pronoun at the end for the person as in languages of the Indo-European stock. This fact, joined\nwith the identity of the substantive verb with our own, opens the way to the identification of the languages. This fact cannot fail to be accepted by philologists generally after no long period. This branch of the Asiatic Society would certainly do well to prosecute research in this direction in the near future. The way in which the verb is formed belongs to the essential structure of language in the Indo-European system. Being much the same in the speech of Tartary, we are compelled to adopt the principle of linguistic unity. The shapes of skulls and facial features differ, but not so much that ethnology will not find a way to account for the variations observed while allowing unity of descent.\n\nThe meeting then adjourned.\n\nMinutes of Proceedings at a General Meeting held at the Society's Library, Museum Road, Shanghai, on Monday, 20th April 1891, at 9 p.m.\n\nDr. Joseph Edkins occupied the chair. There was a large number of members present.\n\nThe minutes of the last meeting having been read by the Hon. Sec., Mr. Mencarini, the Chairman said:\u2014Ladies and Gentlemen, the principal formal business before the meeting before I call upon General Messy to read his paper on \"Yunnan: its Treasures and Trade Routes,\" is to elect Mr. P. J. Hughes, recently Consul-General for Great Britain at this port, to be an Honorary Member of this Society. The number of our honorary members is very few, only six in fact, and it is a very special distinction. We members of the Council feel called upon to elect Mr. Hughes to the position of an honorary member because we feel very sensible, and I believe all the members of the Society in Shanghai unite in this feeling, that this distinction, the highest we can confer, ought to be conferred on Mr. Hughes, because of the very considerable attention he has given to the business of our meetings, and the admirable and courteous way in which he has always conducted the meetings of the Society, and the Council come before you now to ask you to confirm this election, which was mooted at the last meeting. By\nour laws it is necessary, as the Secretary has mentioned in the minutes, to propose an honorary member at one meeting and elect him at another. The Council therefore now propose that Mr. P. J. Hughes be appointed an Honorary Member of this Society. Those who are in favour of this proposition will now kindly signify it by holding up their hands.\n\nThe motion was then carried unanimously amid hearty applause.\n\nThe Chairman:\u2014The only new member elected during the interval is Mr. George Taylor. As there is no further business to transact I will now call upon General Messy to read his paper.\n\nGeneral Messy:\u2014Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen,\u2014The modern name of Yunnan is said to be derived from a range of mountains, on its northern frontier, called the \u96f2\u5dba Yan ling. In speaking of Yunnan generally, the whole province is meant, but the same name is also applied to a prefecture in the same province. It is the chief or principal one of fourteen prefectures, hence it is called the \u9996\u5e9c Shon Fn or Chief Prefecture, but its proper name is Y\u00fcnnan Fu. Besides these, there is also a country called Y\u00fcnnan Hsien, in the prefecture of Ta-li Fu. All this similarity of names is rather confusing to strangers. In official documents, literary essays, and poetical effusions, the character \u5929 Tien is used to represent the whole region known to us as Yunnan, and the combination \u5929\u7701 Tien-Sheng is used in like manner to designate the provincial capital. The name Tien is derived from \u5929\u56fd Tien Kuo, which was the name of an independent nation of the Lolo tribes, occupying that region before the Christian era. Hence the use of the character \u5929 Tien as a convenient phonetic for the designation of that immense province, otherwise called Yunnan.\n\nThe superficial area of Yunnan is over 100,000 English square miles. It extends through seven degrees of latitude and eight degrees of longitude, and is thus larger than Italy, but not near so densely populated as the Italian kingdom. The population of Yunnan has been variously estimated by the Chinese Government, as well as by individual collectors of such statistics, at from 3 to 17 millions.\nThus, in 1842, the official census returns gave a total of 3,574,269 families, which, according to the ordinary mode of calculation, allowing five persons to each family, gives a total of 17,871,345 individuals.\n\nIn 1877, at the close of a civil war that had lasted over twenty years, and had greatly reduced the number of inhabitants, I estimated the population to be about one million families.\n\nJust at that time, however, there was a great influx of people from Szechwan, and other places, so I tabulated the population at about 5,600,000. Two years later an official census was taken, and the population was then declared to be over eleven million individuals.\n\nIn ancient times the taking of the census meant preparations for levying a poll-tax, so statistics were always kept as low as possible by the heads of families, and there is then reason to believe the returns rather low. About two-thirds of the present inhabitants of Yunnan consists of various tribes of Lo-lo, Li-su, Mu-su, Man-tzu and Miao-tzu, collectively called or classed by the Chinese as I-J\u00ean, a term which means \"heathen,\" because the Chinese have failed to convert the native tribes to Confucianism or any other system of morality. These primitive people still retain many of their ancient manners and customs, refraining as much as possible from social intercourse with the Chinese. They have also certain tribal distinctions peculiar to the members of their respective tribes; thus the Miao-tzu and Lung J\u00ean tribes in the eastern part of the province, live and dress differently from those of the centre and north of the province. In the east, especially in the prefecture of Kiang-nan Fu, I noticed the women were dressed in white shirts with large blue collars something like English naval service men. These women are, as a rule, exceedingly active and vigorous, fond of pleasure after their work is over in the evening, singing songs to amuse the old people, and chanting dialogues with their male admirers, whose love and passion is thereby excited to a very high pitch. The women enjoy more liberty of action and freedom from restraint than our European women. No married man ever attempts to interfere with his wife's enjoyment of pleasure, until she becomes\na mother, then a turn takes place. She becomes as virtuous as a saint, and courts her husband instead of other men. Husband and wife live as equals, and no inferiority of the wife is ever thought of in the settlement of family matters; both work hard alike. Amongst the Lo-lo and other tribes the case is very different. The women have to work hard like beasts of burden to maintain their jealous husbands in idleness and comparative ease. Quarrels ending in serious fights are not uncommon between Lo-lo men, jealous of their wives, and Chinese soldiers, admirers of the ill-used women. In the prefecture of Li-chiang Fu and northern parts of the province I have seen the women of the Mu-sn tribes working like slaves in their fields on the mountain sides, or carrying burdens in the valleys from place to place, clad in nothing better than an old piece of tattered cottonade about the loins, descending to the knees, and an undressed goatskin on their backs, fastened over their shoulders and across the chest with a raw hide thong. Thus arrayed, these poor women are exposed to the piercing cold of their snow-clad hills in winter, and to the scorching rays of a mid-day sun in summer, whilst their lazy and jealous husbands remain at home, to nurse the children, sharpen their swords, and keep their powder dry. I have also seen the savage Lu-sn, or Li-su, in the prefecture of Yung-chang Fu, Western Yunnan, ploughing their unhealthy fields in the valley of the Lu-chiang River, with women harnessed to their ploughs instead of cattle; the men held the ploughs, and were fully armed.\n\nA Li-sn farmer does not at all hesitate to harness his wife and mother, sister and daughter, to his plough at any time, while he, with a cross-bow and quiver of poisoned arrows on his back, a long sword in his girdle, and a short spear in one hand, follows the plough, and guides it in the furrow with his other hand. His father and uncle, or brother, son and son-in-law, all fully armed to the teeth, sit and watch the approaches to the family estate, ready to pounce on any unsuspecting Chinaman who may chance to halt on the way, astonished at the spectacle in the fields before him. As might be expected, many of these hardly used native women contract alliances with Chinese soldiers, who treat the\nwomen much better than their native tribesmen. The offspring of such mixed alliances are usually better looking and more intelligent than either of their parents, and as they all speak two or more languages they generally serve as interpreters in the Chinese yamens, or in one or other of the petty courts of the native tribal chief, to whom they are allied by their maternal kindred. Some of these interpreters of mixed parentage become persons of wealth and great influence by reason of their office, and are justly respected by all classes. Some of them, however, only succeed in exciting the hatred of all persons who know them. Having acquired only the vices of both races, without the virtues of either, they concentrate in themselves the very essence of evil, ending their last days in the lowest depths of infamy.\n\nYunnan is bounded on the north by Thibet and Ss\u00fc-ch'nan; on the south by Siam, Annam, and Tongking; on the east by Kuei-Chow and Kuang-si, and on the west by Assam and Burma.\n\nIt is thus surrounded on three sides by foreign countries, the inhabitants of which are probably of kindred race with one or other of the various tribes inhabiting those parts of Yunnan adjoining their respective states.\n\nThe armies of the Chinese Emperor Han Wu Ti are said to have penetrated into Yunnan in the second century B.C., but no successful colonisation of the country was effected until the third century A.D., when the armies of Sin Pi, under the distinguished commander Chn Ko Siang, invaded the country, and subjugated its inhabitants to the sovereign rule of the Minor Han state, the capital of which state was at Ch\u00eang-tu Fu, in Ss\u00fc-ch'nan.\n\nYunnan does not appear to have been regularly annexed and officially administered as a Chinese province until the thirteenth century, when Kublai Khan, the Mongolian conqueror of the Chinese Empire, penetrated with his victorious troops through the whole of Yunnan, even to Burma, imposing his Imperial sway over both those countries, and in fact over nearly the whole of Asia.\n\nThe provincial government of Yunnan\u2014including the Viceroyalty of the Yun-Knei Provinces\u2014is centered in the important walled city, called \u96f2\u5357\u7701\u57ce Y\u00fcnnan Sh\u00eang Ch'\u00eang. The same is also\nthe prefectural capital of \u96f2\u5357\u5e9c Yunnan Fu and the county seat of the \u6606\u660e\u7e23 K'un Ming Magistracy. It lies in Lat. 25\u00b0 06 N., Long. 102\u00b0 52 E. of Greenwich, on the very brink of the famous Lake \u6ec7\u6c60 Tien Chih and 2,000 miles by road south-west from Peking. This vast province is officially divided and subdivided for the convenience of better administration in much the same manner as other Chinese provinces; that is, as follows:\u20144 Circuits, 14 Prefectures, 4 Departments, 8 Districts, 13 sub-Prefectures of the Ting class, 26 sub-Prefectures of the Chou class, and 39 Counties, all of which are entirely under Chinese rule. Besides the above, there are 3 Prefectures, 6 sub-Prefectures of the Chou class, and 4 Counties, enjoying home rule under hereditary native chieftains.\n\nThe principal rivers flowing through Yunnan are eight in number, and they are named as follows:\u2014\n\n1.\u2014Chin Sha Kiang \u91d1\u6c99\u6c5f \"The River of Golden Sands.\"\n2.\u2014Lan-tsang \u6f9c\u6ca7\u6c5f Me-kong River\n3.\u2014Lu \u6f9c\u6c5f Salween\n4.\u2014Lung Ch'nan \u9f8d\u5ddd\u6c5f Dragou\n5.\u2014Y\u00fcn-long \u96f2\u9f8d\u6c5f T'ai-ping\n6.\u2014Hei \u9ed1\u6c5f Black\n7.\u2014Hung \u7d05\u6c5f Red\n8.\u2014Hsi-yang \u897f\u6d0b\u6c5f West\n\nThe first four of these rivers take their rise in Thibet, the other four have their sources in Yunnan. None are navigable within the geographical limits of the province. The most important, though not the largest lake in Yunnan is called \u6ec7\u6c60 Tien Chih, a name which is more applicable to a pool than to the present respectable sheet of water now under notice. Chih means \"pool,\" whilst the usual Chinese name for lake is \u6e56 Hu. Lake Tien is about twenty-five miles long by six or eight broad, and is navigable for boats and small steamers.\n\nThe lake is fed by many small streams, and drained by the Pu Tu Ho, which river throws its waters into the Chin Sha Kiang, about one hundred miles north of the provincial capital. Many\ntowns and villages lie along its shores. Communication by boat is carried on at night,\u2014the strong winds that prevail by day rendering navigation difficult and unpleasant. The wind usually abates about three in the afternoon, and navigation commences at dusk. People subject to sea-sickness thus suffer less from the movement of the boats. The largest lake in Yunnan is called \u6d31\u6d77 Erh Hai, a name which suggests a sea. It is, however, but a lake, about thirty miles long by twenty miles broad in its broadest part. This lake is navigated by many boats at all hours of the day and night, and might also be navigated by steamers. It is fed by many a stream of water from the melting snow on the mountains to the north and west, and it is drained by two streams into the Hei Kiang, or Black River, flowing south into Annam. The city of Ta-li Fu is on its western shore. Yunnan province consists chiefly of an elevated plateau some 5,000 to 6,000 feet above sea-level.\n\nIt is intersected by several mountain ranges, some of which have peaks of great altitude, especially those near the confines of Thibet, which are perpetually covered with snow. The Tsang-shan, overlooking the important prefectural city of \u5927\u7406\u5e9c Ta-li Fu and Lake Erh, Lat. 25\u00b0 44 N., Long. 100\u00b0 22 E., is more or less covered with snow nine months in the year. The climate of Yunnan is pleasantly cool in summer, and fairly healthy, especially on the table land forming the principal portion of the province. The valleys down which flow the San-tsang, the Sn, and the Sung-chnan rivers, are, however, very warm, sultry and dreadfully unhealthy, so much so that few people live in those valleys, although people, living on the neighboring heights, descend to cultivate various crops on the fertile slopes. The natural resources of Yunnan are great indeed. It produces everything necessary for the sustenance of a dense population, despite its present poverty-stricken appearance. Opium, hemp, flax, rhubarb and other drugs abound. Maize, rice, wheat, and other cereals are grown almost everywhere; pears, oranges, lemons, and other fruit, potatoes and other vegetables are also cultivated to more or less perfection in many different places. Fine oxen, excellent sheep, goats, pigs, dogs, ponies, asses, mules, fish, ducks, geese, peacocks and fowls, are also reared and eaten as\nfood by all who can afford such, Mahomedans of course abstaining from the abominable flesh of the hog and the dog. Milk, butter, cheese, tea, sugar, and salt are also produced in various parts of the province, and at reasonable prices. Clothing stuff is, however, very dear, although coarse flannels and strong silks are woven from native produce, and an abundance of fine wool is available for manufacturing the best of cloth on the introduction of suitable machinery for that purpose. The mineral wealth of Yunnan is something enormous, and almost inexhaustible. It is greater by far than that of any other province in China. Rubies and sapphires, garnets and topazes, amethysts and jade abound in the western prefectures; gold, silver, platinum, nickel, copper, tin, lead, zinc, iron, coal and salt also abound in many places. Copper is especially abundant. Its ores are of excellent quality and have been worked for ages in over one thousand different places. This rich province has been more or less open to Chinese commercial intercourse for the long period of twenty-two centuries, and it has been administered entirely as a Chinese province for six centuries or more, yet nothing appears to have been done by the Chinese Government for the benefit of the native tribes whose country has been so forcibly annexed to the Chinese Empire.\n\nThe principal object of the Chinese in retaining their hold of this province appears to have been to secure the contract of its rich deposits of copper and other metals. Millions of taels of silver are expended annually in various ways throughout the province, but despite this fact, the people are exceedingly poor, wretched and miserable. The wealthiest of the natives are neither fed, dressed, or housed with anything like comfort, not to say luxury. Their best food is frugal indeed, and their best clothing is far inferior to that worn by our servants in Shanghai, whilst most of their houses would hardly be considered good enough for the cattle on a respectable English farm.\n\nThis great misery is no doubt principally due to the lack of water communications, and the badness of all roads, but a great deal of it is also due to the general incompetency of Chinese officials to govern alien races, and to the incapacity of the wretched people to govern themselves.\nYunnan will never flourish under Chinese rule. Something better is necessary. Good roads must be made, habits of industry must be encouraged, and the corr\u00e9 system abolished, before any good can be effected. There are ten important roads by which travellers and merchandise may reach the provincial capital of Yunnan, from various parts of China and the surrounding countries, but the best of them is not so good as the worst of country roads in England. The accommodation for man and beast on the best and most frequented is wretched in the extreme. All of them are difficult and costly.\n\nEleven days' overland journey is the shortest time in which the capital of the province can be reached from the nearest river port. The first and most important of these ten routes is the Imperial highway from Peking through Chibli, Shantung, Honan, Hupei, Hunan, Kueichow, and Yunnan, and as far as the borders of Burma. The distance from Peking to Y\u00fcnnan Fu by this route is 5,895 li, or over 2,000 miles, and it takes ordinary travellers at least one hundred days to accomplish the journey. Four months is, however, the usual time. Frequent halts and rests are necessary for the welfare of man and beast, so it happens that every ten or fifteen days the coolies and pack animals are all changed at certain well-known and regularly established centres for that purpose. Carts engaged at Peking may, however, come as far as Hsiang-yang Fu on the Han River in about thirty days without changing, but it is rarely done. The Imperial post couriers bearing important dispatches to or from Peking and Yunnan sometimes do the whole journey, 2,000 miles, in thirty days, but they change ponies every ten or fifteen miles.\n\nThe advent of steamers in China has brought about considerable changes. Thus, travellers leaving Peking for the distant province of Yunnan may now take cart to Tientsin in three days, embark there on a steamer, and reach Shanghai in four or five days. Thence they go by river steamer to Hankow in four days. At Hankow a junk may be hired to go up the Yangtsze River, through the Tungting Lake, and up the Yuan River to Chen-yuan-fu, Kuei-chow province, in forty days. Here the land journey commences,\nas follows: Eight days to Kuei-yang Fu, capital of Kueichow province, thence eighteen days to Y\u00fcnnan Fu, total eighty-eight days, or including rests 100 days. The whole journey may be accomplished in eighty days' actual travelling, but halts and rests are necessary, so 100 days is the usual time occupied in the actual performance of this feat. This is the best possible route for officials just now, in the way of accommodation afloat and ashore, nevertheless it is an arduous and comfortless task for everybody. Merchandise cannot be profitably forwarded to Yunnan by this route as the duties levied in Hunan and Kueichow are so heavy that the merchandise is made too costly for sale in Yunnan.\n\nThe Shih Fu or Chao Tung route is now the most important and least costly of all the trade routes to Yunnan from Central China. Travellers and merchandise may now come to Ichang by steamer, thence travel in junks on the Upper Yangtze, through the Gorges, over the rapids, into Ssu-ch'nan province; pass Chung-k'ing and stop at the prefectural city of Hs\u00fc-chou Fu, also called Shui Fu, in Lat. 28\u00b0 38' N., Long. 104\u00b0 46' E., in about 40 days or six weeks. Here the land journey commences; pack animals and coolies are engaged; your baggage or merchandise is lashed on the pack-saddles and carried by the animals. You mount a sedan-chair and are borne by the coolies in the same manner as on the Imperial highway through Hu-nan and Kuei-chou already mentioned. You pass out of Ssu-ch'uan into Yunnan province at the famous Customs barrier called Lao-ya-tan, thence by the prefectural cities of Chao-tung Fu, Lat. 27\u00b0 20' N., Long. 103\u00b0 50' E., and Tung-ch'uan Fu, Lat. 26\u00b0 21' N., Long. 106\u00b0 26' E., to the provincial capital and prefectural city of Y\u00fcnnan Fu, in twenty-four days; the whole journey from Ichang, by river and road, may be accomplished in about ten weeks, including stoppages. The bulk of Foreign goods now sold in Yunnan passes by this route, as the duties, though heavy, are still lighter than on all the other routes, and there is less danger of being robbed or squeezed by marauders. The alternate route to this from the Upper Yangtze is the third route, which is called the Yung-ting Hsian Wei route. Instead of going up as\nfar as Shui Fu we turn up a small river called the \u6c38\u752f\u6cb3 Yung-ning Ho, near the county seat of the \u7d0d\u8c3f\u7e23 Na-ch'i Hsien Magistracy, Lat. 28\u00b0 48' N., Long. 105\u00b0 23' E., in the district of L\u00fc-ch'on, Ssu-ch'unan province. Junks from Ichang cannot go farther than Na-ch'i Hsien, smaller boats are necessary, and the journey to Yung-ning Hsien takes about four days, according to the state of the river. \u6c38\u5be7\u7e23 Yung-ning Hsien is the name of the solitary county in the department called \u53d9\u6c38\u76f4\u96b7\u5ef3 Hs\u00fc-Yung Chih-li Ting, Lat. 28\u00b0 08' N., Long. 105\u00b0 18' E. Ssu-ch'unan province, on the frontiers of Kuei-Chou province. It is the centre of a considerable amount of trade between both provinces.\n\nHere the land journey commences with pack animals and coolie carriers as on the other route, passing through the cities Pi-chieh Hsien and Wei-ning Chon, by a difficult and mountainous road crossing the \u9752\u6cb3 Ch'ing Ho, a small river forming the boundary line between the provinces of Yunnan and Kuei-chow. The first city we reach in Yunnan province is the sub-prefectural seat of \u5b9c\u5a01\u5dde Hs\u00fcan-wei Chow, Lat. 26\u00b0 25' N., Long 104\u00b0 E., in the prefecture of Ch'\u00fc-ching Fu, arriving at Y\u00fcnnan Fu, the capital of Yunnan province, in twenty-one days. The road through Kuei-Chow being mountainous, and paved with rough limestone boulders which are as hard as flint and as smooth as glass, and as slippery as ice, is exceedingly tiresome and trying to man and beast. Officials and ordinary travellers prefer it however to the Shui-fu-Chiao-tung route, but merchants with ordinary merchandise prefer the latter, as they thereby avoid the payment of dues in Kuei-Chow province. Traffic through Kuei-Chow is thus discouraged by the levying of dues on goods in transit.\n\nThe K'iang Hnng Ssu Mao route was proposed by Captain Spriye many years ago as being suitable for the building of a railroad from Burma to Yunnan, and it is no doubt the likeliest to prove profitable as a railroad speculation. The British Indian Government may now encourage the building of railways through any part of Burma up to the Chinese frontier, and that line is said to be by far the easiest yet found. \u601d\u8305\u7e23 Ssu Mao Ting lies in Lat. 23\u00b0 30' N., Long. 101\u00b0 40' E., in the prefecture of Pu Erh Fu,\nYunnan province, and distant from the provincial capital about twenty-two days' journey, over the same kind of rough and rugged roads common to all parts of the Yunn-kuei Vice-royalty. Pack animals and coolie carriers are also indispensable on this route. England cannot, of course, build railroads in China, but she can do so in Burma, and the sooner it is done the better, in order to place her manufactures as near as possible to the distributing markets at reasonable prices. This has often been spoken of as the most promising route for the development of British trade with Yunnan, and it no doubt possesses certain advantages which must not be lost sight of.\n\nFine river steamers ascend the Irrawaddi River as far up as Bhamo, and it would not be a very difficult matter to build a railway from Bhamo, across the Katchyen Hills to Man-Yin on the Chinese frontier side of those hills, but the wild Katchyens are troublesome people. They must be tamed, and given, or found, a suitable means of livelihood, otherwise they will always prove a nuisance and terror, as they have been for ages, to all traders passing through their country. Man-Yin is distant from the nearest Chinese city, Teng Yneh Ting, four days' journey, or about eighty miles on an easy road, through a well cultivated and fertile plain. Teng Yneh Ting is a sub-Prefecture of Yung Chang Fu, and the sub-Prefectural city lies in Lat. 24\u00b0 58' N., Long. 98\u00b0 45' E. The city of Teng Yneh is, however, still four days' journey distant from Yung Chang Fu, twelve days from Ta-li Fu, and twenty-five days from Yunnan Fu, the Provincial capital. This road, lying as it does across three large rivers and six ranges of high mountains, is far from proving an easy one to railway-makers across the province of Yunnan. The best thing England can do for her manufacturers is to transport the produce of their industry as near and cheaply as possible to the consuming markets, on the frontiers of China.\n\nThe next route is the Pai-s\u00e8-knang-nan route. Travellers on this route leaving Canton in a junk may come up the West River to Wu-chou Fu, Kuangsi province, in about eight days, at all seasons of the year, thence passing Nan-ning Fu\nreach \u767e\u8272\u5ef3 Pai S\u00ea Ting, Lat. 24\u00b0 N., Long 106\u00b0 20' E., in one month, or six weeks, according to the state of the river current, which is sometimes very swift. Pai S\u00ea Ting, is the centre of a considerable amount of trade in Foreign and other goods from Canton with Kuei-chou and Yunnan, favourably situated as it is at the head of navigation for junks on the West River. There are two trade routes leading thence to Y\u00fcnnan Fu. It is the first of these that I call the sixth route, or Pai S\u00ea Kwang-nan route. Leaving Pai S\u00ea Ting and travelling by \u5ee3\u5357\u5e9c Kuang-nan Fu, Lat. 24\u00b0 10' N., Long. 105\u00b0 06' E., Y\u00fcnnan Fu may be reached in about twenty-five days, as follows: Ascending first by boat from the city of Poi-s\u00ea, we may reach \u525d\u9698 Po-ai, which is a market-town on the frontier of Yunnan, in three or four days. At Po-ai, pack animals and coolie carriers are engaged, journeying thence across mountains and valleys the prefectural city of \u5ee3\u5357\u5e9c Kuang-nan Fu, Lat. 24\u00b0 10' N., Long. 105\u00b0 06' E., may be reached in seven days, and Y\u00fcnnan Fu may be reached in fourteen days more, thus making the whole journey by land and water about twenty-five days from Pai-s\u00ea. Boats from Po-ai to Pai-s\u00ea going with the stream do that part of the journey easily in one day, thus three days are saved on the return journey. The land route accommodation is exceedingly bad, cattle and people all herd in the same room or shed. Pack animals and coolies are not always to be found at Po-ai, especially in the summer months, as the town is very unhealthy.\n\nThe seventh route is the Pai-s\u00ea Hsing-yi route. This other route from Pai-s\u00ea Ting to Y\u00fcnnan Fu passes through the prefectural city of \u8208\u7fa9\u5e9c Hsing-yi-fu, Lat. 25\u00b0 15' N., Long. 106\u00b0 E., in Kueichon province. It is the route usually followed by officials going from Kwangtung and Kwangsi to Yunnan, and has the advantage of being somewhat easier than the other, having inns for the accommodation of travellers, and provisions for their entertainment. It is possible to get along better than on the other route, but with all this it is still very bad, and the journey cannot be accomplished in much less than twenty-five days, twenty-three days being considered a good journey.\nIt will not pay however to send merchandise by this route, as duty must be paid on such whilst passing through Knei-chon. The eighth route, the Pak-hoi Kai-hua route, is a long and tedious route, entirely overland along the frontiers of Tongking, and around by the prefectural city of K'ai-hua Fu, Lat. 23\u00b0 10' N., Long. 104\u00b0 50' E., Yunnan province, and on to the provincial capital. It is a journey of fifty-two days. It is the route followed by large bands of armed traders from Pak-hoi, who carry foreign goods to Yunnan and return with opium from that province. The ninth route, the Lao-kai Man-hao Route, is now the shortest of all land routes to the capital of Yunnan, from the surrounding countries. Steamers ascend from Hanoi, in Tongking, to Lao-kai, and junks get up to the port of Man-hao, at the head of the navigable part of the now famous Red River. At Man-hao, pack animals and coolie carriers are obtainable, and the journey thence through Meng-tzu Hsien, Lat. 23\u00b0 34' N., Long. 103\u00b0 36' E., Yunnan province, to Y\u00fcnnan Fu, is usually accomplished in eleven days. This is a very important matter to people who are interested in trade generally, but more especially to Chinese merchants in Yunnan. Yet, strange to say, the Chinese Government abandoned this important trade route to the tender mercies of the Black Flag filibusters for years without attempting to improve it or even to protect its own enterprising merchants, who, from time to time of late years, have attempted to trade thereon with the neighboring states in that region. All other routes from the highest point of navigation to Y\u00fcnnan Fu are longer by half, and no better off in point of convenience and accommodation for travellers and merchandise.\n\nChina has lost a favorable opportunity to benefit her people in Yunnan, and it is now too late to repair the fault by which she lost it. The tenth route, the Assam Wei-Hsi route, is one by which Yunnan may be reached from the British possessions in Assam, and which might be opened up to trade, for the mutual benefit of all parties concerned. The journey to Y\u00fcnnan Fu, passing through the cities of Wei-hsi-ting, Lat. 27\u00b0 30' N., Long. 100\u00b0 05' E.; and Li-kiang Fu, Lat. 26\u00b0 52' N., Long. 100\u00b0 27' E., is also a toilsome and trying one, and occupies three or four\nweeks at best, with the usual pack animals; no coolies worth having are available on this route. Each stage or day's journey on all the routes to Yunnan is supposed to be about twenty-five miles in actual length of route travelled, but in reality the stages vary from twenty or thirty miles, according to the difficulties of the road, and the accommodation available, so that the average is probably something less than twenty-five miles on a long journey.\n\nThe cost for transport or conveyance of goods and travellers is about the same on all the routes; that is, pack animals are usually paid three mace of silver for each stage, and coolies two mace for the same stages. Each animal can carry about 160 lbs. English, divided into two parcels of equal weight. The coolies, carry half that weight, also made up into two parcels. Heavier parcels may however be carried by two or more coolies in litters like sedan-chairs, but the weight carried by each coolie, in such cases is about twenty per cent. less than in the former case. The cost of carriage is thus very high indeed, so that it behoves all governments and people interested in the expansion of trade with Yunnan to do all they possibly can to lay their merchandise as near as possible to the various centres of consumption at the lowest possible prices consistent with profitable undertakings. The Chinese Government will not do anything for the improvement of the wretched condition of the people of Yunnan. Here then is an opportunity for simple Christianity and intelligent, humane missionaries. That distant province has in fact been a constant drain on the resources of the Empire for ages past, and is likely to continue so in future. In 1865 when nearly the whole of Yunnan was in the hands of the Mussulman rebels, China was on the point of relinquishing her hold of the province, and it would have been much better for her if she had done so. The only hope of relief from her present wretched condition that Yunnan may expect, is the probability that a man of talent in the art of governing will, some day, appear in that region, to carve himself a new and promising kingdom from that long ill-ruled fragment of this ancient and vast Empire.*\n\n* General Messy desires to express his indebtedness to Mr. G. M. H. Playfair's excellent work on the Cities and Towns of China, from which the latitudes and longitudes given in the paper are taken as the most reliable authority extant on the subject.\nGeneral Mesny was warmly applauded when he finished speaking, and when order was again called, the Chairman, in thanking the reader of the paper, said it was most interesting to have their attention called to the little-known province General Mesny had described in the pleasing form of an itinerary.\n\nThe Chairman then said he had been reminded while General Mesny was speaking of Du Halde's great book, and it struck him that beyond all doubt itineraries and papers containing full and reliable information like that they had just heard must be considered most valuable, and likely to add considerably to the good results of their Society. There are many things which render the province of Yunnan most interesting to Foreigners at the present time. They had all been interested in the Japanese miners who went there some time ago, and who are still working at the mines in order to give the Chinese an opportunity of profiting by their experience, and to show them how the resources of Yunnan may be exploited in a proper manner. A lot of information about Yunnan is to be derived from the interesting account of that province given by Mr. Happer in his Trade Report for last year published by the Customs. They were also particularly well off in having such a valuable book as Roche's on Yunnan, but if anyone wants to know the results to be expected from the working of the gold, copper and silver mines of the province, or to get a brief and concise account of them, Mr. Happer's report is the best work to be consulted.\n\nMr. Donovan, in proposing a cordial vote of thanks to General Mesny, said the description the writer of the valuable paper they had just heard read had given of those trade routes was remarkably interesting to them at this time. He had been particularly struck with the account given of the terrible way the women of the province are treated, and he should like to ask General Mesny what is their condition in those districts of Yunnan which enjoy the blessings of home rule, and are they better off there than in the districts under the government of the Chinese.\n\nGeneral Mesny replied that the natives living under home rule are no better off than the natives of the other districts, because the Chinese Government compels the natives of the province generally\nto contribute a considerable amount of grain and other tribute to the Imperial revenue.\n\nRev. W. Muirhead seconded the vote of thanks proposed to General Mesny by Mr. Donovan, and said the paper they had heard was a very valuable contribution to our knowledge of Yunnan, and he hoped the greatest publicity would be given to it. He had often marvelled at the wonderful amount of general information to be derived from Central Asian sources, and felt how much we are indebted to those who have undergone hardship and privation in order to visit those remote regions and describe them to us, thereby adding so inestimably to our knowledge of things in general. Their friend had done well in putting together such a valuable paper in connection with his itineraries, and it would be very much to be regretted if his knowledge were not availed of. They would all be highly pleased to hear General Mesny had been appointed to some position in Yunnan where his unique knowledge could be made practically useful. They were aware he had been there for a number of years, and it would be interesting if he gave them a narrative of his experiences as regards himself, but at the same time, as a Society, they were indebted to a very great degree to him for the important information given them that night. The important view which presented itself to Mr. Muirhead from hearing General Mesny's paper was in connection with ethnological observation. Was it not wonderful that the tribes of Yunnan have existed in that great country in such a low condition for thousands of years? We have been accustomed to speak of the Chinese as a very long-lived people; they have been here for millenniums, but when we look at their annals we find there were people here earlier than they, and it was about these they had heard from General Mesny there that night. We are aware the Babylonians, Persians, and other contemporary nations have long disappeared, and to what extent we know them we know them only from inscriptions on stone and from the scattered remains of the great edifices they constructed; but not only the Chinese, but people of China anterior to the Chinese, are living here still, and it is of the utmost importance to enquire in what way they might be improved, civilised and, above\nall, Christianised; and Mr. Muirhead trusted that there will be an impetus imparted to some at least of the missionaries to make them seek those poor people of whom they had just heard with such deep interest.\n\nMr. Taylor asked could General Mesny give any further information about the winds he had referred to as agitating the lakes of Yunnan by day and dying away at night.\n\nGeneral Mesny replied he had paid some attention to the matter for a month by going down to the lake every day when there was a strong breeze blowing, and the water was very much agitated, but in the evening the wind always subsided and the water became smooth. In the West Indies there is nearly always a sea breeze by day and a land breeze by night.\n\nMr. Bakdon said, when they came to the meeting they had all expected to hear a great deal of valuable information from General Mesny about Yunnan, and they had heard it, but still there were one or two points upon which he thought a good deal of information might still have been given. The great interest that has attached to Yunnan of late years, so far as he could see, was due to its great trade possibilities. There has been a sort of feeling prevailing very generally that Yunnan is a species of El Dorado where fortunes could easily and rapidly be made by any adventurer enterprising enough to tap her immense mineral wealth,\u2014a feeling probably due to the exploits of the 18 or 19 Japanese gentlemen referred to by Dr. Edkins that evening. But they were all aware that mining is a precarious mode of making a fortune, and legitimate trade is generally considered a much better way of acquiring wealth. He was disappointed to find from what General Mesny had said about the trade of Yunnan that there are no imports. General Mesny had laid down and described very fully ten distinct trade routes, and his description of them was not very promising for the growth of import trade. Suppose we go about importing a vast amount of merchandise, how are we to do it? We will have enormous distances to travel before goods can be laid down in any considerable centres in Yunnan, and there are absolutely no facilities there for cheap\nand rapid transit. Everyone who has been in China knows the value of her waterways, but there are no waterways in Yunnan, and all the transit has to be done by coolies, and coolies at 250 cash a day for 14 days would be very expensive work. It is plain the import trade in Yunnan is not going to be a very great success. There are eleven millions of inhabitants in Yunnan, of whom two-thirds are cultivated savages. When he heard of trade routes that were going to be opened up to Yunnan and Burma he always asked what is going to be the result of them. There is a certain amount of import trade now going on in Yunnan; goods can be carried from Hankow to Yunnan for considerably less money than in any other part of China, but when Yunnan comes to be generally supplied with goods, the question of where she is going to be supplied from is one possessing special interest for the natives of Shanghai. From what General Mesny had said, he seemed to think that Burma will be the ultimate source of import into Yunnan, but would that do people here any good? Referring to the condition of Yunnan generally, Mr. Bredon said he was very much inclined to think that the remark made by Lord Salisbury about the Sister Kingdom, that it wants a few years of strong government, applies in an eminent degree to the province General Mesny had just described. He just dropped these few remarks hoping General Mesny would tell them something about the prospects of Yunnan, and how far the popular opinion that it is a kind of El Dorado or Goleonda, and the hopes of the great future in store for it, are likely to be realised.\n\nThe Chairman said Mr. Happer spoke of musk and tin as articles of export from Yunnan, and he noticed the export of these articles is increasing rapidly. If the imports cannot be great the exports may be very valuable, and of course the expense of carrying articles is decreased in proportion to the value of the goods. There is every reason to hope that in the going forward of Christian missions immense good will be done for the development of Yunnan, because in Burma the success of the missions had been attended with a remarkable improvement in the condition of that country.\nThe vote of thanks proposed to General Mesny by Mr. Donovan and seconded by Rev. Mr. Muirhead was then put to the meeting and carried with acclamation.\n\nGeneral Mesny, in answer to Mr. Bredon's enquiries about the prospects of trade in Yunnan, said the only routes that were likely to be improved in a satisfactory manner were the route by the Red River to Tongking and one or two others that were likely to be improved by the opening of Chungking, and something also might be done by way of Burma. He had not recommended the building of railroads in Yunnan, because the country offered too many natural obstacles, but still something can doubtless be done to improve matters relating to trade there very considerably. He was very grateful to the meeting for the attentive hearing they had given him and for the vote of thanks they had passed to him.\n\nThe proceedings then terminated.\nLIST OF OFFICERS OF THE SOCIETY\n\n1891-92.\n\nPresident: N.
