Smith, I.C.S., M.R.A.S.\n\nIn a recent paper Dr. Bloch has made a valuable contribution to knowledge by publishing an edition and translation of the inscription on the colossal statue found at S\u0101h\u0113t-M\u0101h\u0113t by Sir Alexander Cunningham in 1862\u201363. When Dr. Bloch published this paper he had not read my essay entitled \"Kaus\u0101mb\u012b and \u015ar\u0101vast\u012b.\" I have since sent him a copy of my paper, but he still adheres to the view expressed in his. I may therefore deal with Dr. Bloch's statement of opinion as if he had expressly considered my views and had rejected them. I propose in the following pages to defend my position.\n\nThe inscription, which is imperfect at the beginning, is translated as follows by Dr. Bloch:\n\n\"(During the reign of \u2014\u2014, in the year \u2014\u2014, season \u2014\u2014, half-month \u2014\u2014, on the) 19th (day), on this date (specified as) above, (this statue of) a Bodhisattva, (together with) an umbrella and a stick, (being) the gift of the monk Bala, a teacher of the Tripitaka, (and) fellow-wanderer of the monk Pu\u1e63ya-(mitra), has been set up in \u010cr\u0101vasti, at the place where the Blessed One (i.e. Buddha) used to walk,\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1900.\nin the Kosamba-kuti, for the acceptance of the teachers belonging to the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da School.\u201d\n\nThe inscription unquestionably states that this statue was set up in \u015ar\u0101vasti. For my present purpose, namely, the discussion of the position of \u015ar\u0101vasti, I am not concerned with any other information to be deduced from the record. The image having been set up in \u015ar\u0101vasti, and having been found in S\u0101het, a section of the ruins of S\u0101het-M\u0101het, the conclusion necessarily follows that, if the image when found was in its original position, S\u0101het must be \u015ar\u0101vasti.\n\nDr. Bloch fully recognizes the necessity of establishing the proposition that the statue when found was in its original position. He also recognizes, though by no means fully or adequately, the fact that the apparent testimony of the inscription as to the position of \u015ar\u0101vasti is contradicted by the unequivocal testimony of Fa-hian early in the fifth century and of Hiuen Tsiang in the seventh century.\n\nIn continuation of the arguments adduced in my essay entitled \u201cKa\u015b\u0101mbi and \u015ar\u0101vasti\u201d I now undertake to show that (1) there is strong reason to believe that the statue had been moved from its original position before its discovery, and (2) that the testimony of the Chinese pilgrims as to the geographical position of \u015ar\u0101vasti is far more emphatic than Dr. Bloch will allow, and is absolutely irreconcilable with the supposed evidence given by the inscription. Of course, if the statue was not found in its original position the inscription is irrelevant to the question as to the position of \u015ar\u0101vasti, and the Chinese pilgrims\u2019 concurrent testimony remains unshaken and must be accepted. I shall take the opportunity of recording some observations based on two recent visits to S\u0101het-M\u0101het, and of showing the absolute futility of the reasons, apart from\n\n---\n\n1 J.A.S.B. for 1898, vol. lxviii, part i, p. 278.\n2 J.R.A.S., July, 1898, p. 603.\n3 I was Commissioner of the Fyzabad Division, which includes the Gond\u0101 and Bahraich Districts, from the end of November, 1898, to the end of July, 1899, and was on tour for nearly three months. My official duties were heavy, and left me little time for archaeological work. This paper has been written at intervals, and is consequently, I fear, somewhat wanting in literary finish.\nthe statue, for believing S\u0101het-M\u0101het to be \u015ar\u0101vasti. A few words, in conclusion, on the general credibility of the Chinese pilgrims, and the extent to which we are at liberty to reject their testimony, will not be out of place.\n\nCunningham succeeded in satisfying himself that S\u0101het-M\u0101het must be \u015ar\u0101vasti by a series of fallacious arguments, and arbitrary alterations of the Chinese pilgrims' texts.\n\nFa-hian proceeded from Kannuji to \u0100-le, which I have proved to be Jogikot in the Un\u0101 District. Thence he went south-east to Sh\u0101-che. According to the Chinese text the distance from \u0100-le to Sh\u0101-che is ten yojanas. According to the Corean text it is three yojanas, which seems to be the more probable. Both texts agree in making Sh\u0101-che to be south-east from \u0100-le. Its site must, therefore, be either in the Un\u0101 District or in the Rai Bareli District.\n\nBut Cunningham insisted on identifying Sh\u0101-che with S\u016bketa, which is said to be used in the R\u0101m\u0101yana as a synonym for Ajodhya. There is no warrant for the identification of Sh\u0101-che with S\u016bketa. Ajodhya (close to which city I am now writing) is about 80 miles from the possible southern position of Sh\u0101-che, and about 115 miles from the possible northern position of that place.\n\nCunningham saw the difficulty, and, as usual, in order to remove it, altered the pilgrims' text. He next identified the Vis\u0101kh\u0101 of Hiuen Tsiang with the Sh\u0101-che of Fa-hian, and having persuaded himself that Sh\u0101-che, S\u016bketa, Vis\u0101kh\u0101, and Ajodhya were all one and the same place, he proceeded to ascertain the position of \u015ar\u0101vasti. Again the distances would not fit, and Cunningham had no hesitation in arbitrarily altering Hiuen Tsiang's \"500 li\" to \"the nearest round number of 350 li,\" or 58 miles, to bring it into accordance with the other [statement]. Now,\" he proceeds, \"as this is the exact distance from Ajodhya of the great ruined city on the south bank of the Rapti, called\n\n---\n\n1. \"Report,\" i, 329. Cunningham quotes a verse professing to be in the K\u0101lid\u0101sa, but gives no reference. Ferguson long ago (\"Archaeology in India\") proved that \u015ar\u0101vasti and Sh\u0101-che were not identical, and that neither of the Chinese pilgrims visited the Hindu town of Ajodhya.

C. Mukherji and Major Waddell, I.M.S., Mr. Mukherji's report will be published under my superintendence. Major Waddell is understood to be preparing an independent report.\nBoth pilgrims, therefore, place \u015ar\u0101vast\u012b from 84 to 90 miles in a north-westerly direction from Kapilavastu. The trend of the mountains rigidly limits the direction in which a pair of compasses can be applied to the map. As I have already shown, the required position for Kapilavastu is where the R\u0101pti issues from the mountains to the north-east of Nep\u0101lgunj. Dr. Vost and I went there, and saw very extensive and very ancient ruins of a large city, including two stupas, and we heard of many more ruins which we were unable to visit. Having found the remains of an extremely ancient city of great size exactly in the place where, according to the concurrent testimony of both pilgrims \u015ar\u0101vast\u012b stood, we logically inferred that the ruins which we discovered must be those of \u015ar\u0101vasti. How can the inference be disputed? I have shown that Cunningham's geographical arguments are invalid. The concurrent testimony of the Chinese travellers, confirmed by observation, should not be rejected except for good reason. Where is such reason? There is none but the statue.\n\nDr. Bloch, though living in Calcutta, with every map in India at his disposal, oddly remarks that he is unable to make out with certainty the distance of Kapilavastu from S\u00e9t (S\u0101het)-M\u0101het. There is no difficulty or mystery about it. S\u0101het-M\u0101het is distant in a north-westerly direction about eleven miles from the town of Balr\u0101mpur (now a railway station), and nine miles from the Balr\u0101mpur camping-ground. It stands on the banks of the R\u0101pti on the boundary of the Gond\u0101 and Bahraich Districts, part of the ruins being in each district. From S\u0101het-M\u0101het to the site of Kapilavastu is about fifty-five miles. S\u0101het-M\u0101het is about W.S.W. from Kapilavastu. The distance is certainly between fifty and sixty miles. I cannot be more precise, owing to the difficulty of distinguishing the ruins of Kapilavastu from those of the towns of Krakucanda and Kon\u0101gamana and the ten unnamed deserted towns in the region which are mentioned by Hiuen Tsiang. Now a distance of about fifty-five miles cannot possibly be made to agree with the distance of about ninety miles stated by both pilgrims.\nInasmuch as S\u0101het-M\u0101het is a little south of west from Kapilavastu, no ingenuity can reconcile that fact with the concurrent testimony of both pilgrims that \u015ar\u0101vasti was north-west from Kapilavastu, if S\u0101het-M\u0101het be identified with \u015ar\u0101vasti.\n\nAll this was so obvious to me that I did not take the trouble to develop the statement in \"Kaus\u0101mbi and \u015ar\u0101vasti,\" and was content to say briefly that Set (S\u0101het)-M\u0101het could not possibly be the real site of \u015ar\u0101vasti, because it is \"too near Kapilavastu and in the wrong direction.\"\n\nAs people seem slow to accept the plainest facts which conflict with a traditional belief I must rub in the facts.\u00b9 I repeat that both Chinese pilgrims, writing at an interval from each other of more than two centuries, reckoning from slightly different points, one counting in li and the other in yojanas, agree in saying that \u015ar\u0101vasti was nearly ninety miles north-west from Kapilavastu. Owing to the trend of the mountains, the only possible position for \u015ar\u0101vasti that accords with the pilgrims' evidence is that discovered by Dr. Vost and me. Unless both the pilgrims purposelessly lied about the position of a place which they both visited, S\u0101het-M\u0101het, which is south instead of north of west from Kapilavastu, and is only about fifty-five miles distant, instead of about ninety miles, cannot possibly be \u015ar\u0101vasti. There is no conceivable reason why the two pilgrims should have lied in the matter. The different modes in which they calculated the distance, and the agreement of the results, preclude the hypothesis of textual error. Therefore, unless there is evidence to show that the pilgrims' statements cannot be true, their evidence must be believed, and \u015ar\u0101vasti must be where I place it. There is no such evidence, unless it be that of the statue.\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 Dr. Hoey has recently avowed his continued belief in the identity of S\u0101het-M\u0101het and \u015ar\u0101vasti.\n\u00b2 I am, of course, aware that Dr. Hoey derives the name Set, which he uses in preference to S\u0101het, from some form of \u015ar\u0101vasti. But such derivation cannot be proved, and is, I think, phonologically impossible. If independent proof of the identity existed, some confirmation might be obtained from Dr. Hoey's observations. That gentleman points out that in certain elements the Buddhist legend of Vi\u1e47\u1e0dhaka agrees with a fairy tale which he heard at S\u0101het-M\u0101het,\ntherefore proceed to show that the so-called evidence of the statue is worthless.\n\nThe ruins of S\u0101het-M\u0101he\u1e6d consist of two principal parts. There are also numerous scattered mounds in the neighbourhood, some of which I shall notice when describing my personal observations on the spot. The two principal parts of the ruins are the walled city, now known locally as M\u0101he\u1e6d, and the group of buildings known as S\u0101het, a short distance from the south-west corner of the city. Cunningham believed S\u0101het to be the site of the Jetavana. When excavating here he found a small temple with very thick walls, the dimensions of which he states as follows:\n\n- Interior . . . . 7\u00bd' square.\n- Exterior . . . . 19' \u00d7 18'.\n\nA statue of a standing figure broken off a few inches above the ankles was found leaning against the back wall. When the statue had been moved, and the floor of the temple cleared, \"it was seen that the pedestal of the statue was still standing erect in its original position. The floor was paved with large stones, and immediately in front of the pedestal there was a long flat slab 3\u00bd feet by 1\u00bd foot, with a pair of hollow footmarks in the centre and two sunken panels on each side. At the back of the incised feet towards the pedestal there was a rough hollow, 3\u00bd feet long by 4 inches broad, which, judging from what I have seen in Burma, must once have held a long stone or metal frame for the reception of lights in front of the statue. But all this arrangement was certainly of later date than the statue itself, for on opening up the floor it was found that\n\nand that a st\u016bpa in which a begging-pot, alms-bowl, and a porcelain bowl containing sahas were found, may be the st\u016bpa of S\u0101riputra, in which such relics were enshrined. But there is no inscription to confirm the identification, and similar relics might occur in many st\u016bpas. As a matter of fact, memorials of S\u0101riputra were numerous. In the \"Ka-hian where there are three towers in honour of S\u0101riputra, of Munjalaputra, of Ananda\" (Ka-hian, ch. vii). The name of S\u0101riputra occurs in an inscription found in the Kasi ruins (Arch. Rep., vol. xxii, pl. iv). As to the name of the place, I did not hear the form Set.\n\nEveryone whom I met used the form S\u0101het-M\u0101he\u1e6d (\u0938\u093e\u0939\u0947\u091f \u092e\u093e\u0939\u0947\u091f). The t is the cerebral, and I think that the a vowels are long, but as to this latter point I am not quite certain.\nthe Buddhaped slab concealed the lower two lines of an inscription, which fortunately had been thus preserved from injury, while the third or uppermost line had been almost entirely destroyed.\"\n\nThe statue was a colossus. Cunningham erroneously supposed it to be that of Buddha the Teacher, and fancied that it was the statue actually seen by Hiuen Tsang. Dr. Bloch has shown that it is a statue of a Bodhisattva.\n\nCunningham gives the height as 7 feet 4 inches. Dr. Anderson gives the height as 11 feet 8 inches.\\(^1\\) The discrepancy is a good illustration of the difficulty experienced in obtaining accurate statements of fact. The inscription on the pedestal is in characters of the Northern K\u1e63atrapa type, and may be roughly dated at the beginning of the Christian era, either a little earlier or a little later. The statue itself, of course, dates from the same period. The material is Mathur\u0101 sandstone, and must therefore have been carried a distance of about 300 miles. The direct distance from Mathur\u0101 to S\u016bhet-M\u0101het is about 270 or 280 miles.\n\nThe particulars given above show that the statue as it was found at S\u016bhet had been reverenced by some person who cared nothing about the inscription and who probably could not read it. The greater part of the inscription was carefully covered up by a slab engraved with a representation of Buddha's feet. This slab was let into the stone floor which had to be opened up before the slab could be extricated, or the inscription revealed. It is, therefore, obvious that both the floor and the slab are of later date than the inscribed statue, and that when the statue and slab were imbedded in the floor the inscription was of no importance or interest to the builder. Now, if the statue really occupied its original position in 'Buddha's Walk' in \u015ar\u0101vasti, is it conceivable that the inscription should be thus covered up? It is quite inconceivable that the original\n\n\\(^1\\) Cunningham, \"Reports,\" i, p. 339; xi, pp. 84, 86. Anderson, \"Catalogue and Handbook of the Archaeological Collections in the Indian Museum,\" part i, p. 194. The slab with the impressions of Buddha's feet is described on p. 193.\ndedicator, Bala, should have concealed his own inscription. Why should any later worshipper have gone to the trouble of covering up the inscription on an image occupying such an exceptionally sacred position? But if we assume that the image was brought from \u015ar\u0101vasti and was set up at S\u0101het centuries after its original dedication, and when the characters of the inscription were no longer legible, the assumption exactly fits the facts. The R\u0101pt\u012b river, which flows past both \u015ar\u0101vasti and S\u0101het, afforded a ready means of transport. The distance is only about 50 miles, and the statue could have been brought down by a country boat in a few days. The difficulties in the original transport of the stone from the neighbourhood of Mathur\u0101 were incomparably greater.\n\nI think that this hypothesis of transport must be adopted because, as I have shown, we are bound to accept the testimony of the pilgrims unless it is controverted by incontestible archaeological facts. The facts which were supposed to contradict the pilgrims do not really controvert them in the least, while the theory of removal of the statue explains the fact of the concealment of the inscription, which is inexplicable on the assumption that the statue occupies the position in which it originally was dedicated.\n\nI think it possible that the removal took place as late as the eleventh or twelfth century, in the time of the Buddhist revival under the P\u0101la kings. Dr. Hoey found at S\u0101het a long Buddhist inscription dated V.S. 1276 = A.D. 1219\u201320.\u00b9\n\nAt Kass\u0101, in the Gorakhpur District, too, there is a fine mediaeval Buddhist group, M\u0101th\u0101 Kuar, belonging to the time of the P\u0101la kings.\n\n\u00b9 Hoey, \"Set Mahet\" (extra number of J.A.S.B. for 1892, p. 57). The inscription has been edited by Professor Kielhorn (Ind. Ant. for 1898, vol. xvi, p. 61), whose version Dr. Hoey has with some boldness undertaken to amend. Dr. Hoey gives the date as 1176. Dr. Hoey, though a firm believer in the identity of S\u0101het-M\u0101het with \u015ar\u0101vasti, which he never questioned, was by no means certain that the statue was found in its original position. He says: \"The large statue found in 12 by General Cunningham may have been there from a very ancient date\" (p. 46). He shows that the buildings have been frequently altered and added to.\nI cannot see any improbability in the removal of the statue. Old statues from ruins are constantly picked up by villagers, dubbed with orthodox names, and put into temples. Why should not a P\u0101la king or somebody else move an exceptionally valuable statue from the \u015ar\u0101vasti jungles when easy water carriage was available?\n\nI, therefore, am convinced that the inscribed statue found at S\u0101het was not found in its original position, and that there is no difficulty in believing that it may have been removed from the true site of \u015ar\u0101vasti and set up where it was discovered as late as A.D. 1200, when nobody was able to read the ancient inscriptions.\n\nThe concurrent testimony of the two Chinese travellers as to the position of \u015ar\u0101vasti remains unshaken and must be accepted. That testimony places \u015ar\u0101vasti in the position of the ancient city discovered by Dr. Vost and me.\n\nTo prevent any possible misconception, I had better repeat that we did not profess to ascertain the exact site of \u015ar\u0101vasti, or to identify any building. We cannot yet tell whether the ruins which we saw belong to the main city itself, or to its suburbs, or to dependent towns. But I have no doubt that the position of \u015ar\u0101vasti and the Jetavana has been determined within a limit of a very few miles.\n\nDr. Vost has drawn my attention to the observation which we noted that the tract below the hills near the ruins is called Uda\u00efn, and that this name may well be a reminiscence of R\u0101j\u0101 Udayana, whose name is connected both with Kaus\u0101mbi and \u015ar\u0101vasti.\n\nThe R\u0101j\u0101 of N\u0101p\u0101ra tells me that he has seen at Mah\u0101deo or Mah\u0101deva, in the forest, a st\u016bpa-like structure larger than the one which we saw at Intaw\u0101. I have no doubt that further exploration will reveal many more ruins, but I understand that the tract is almost entirely covered with dense jungle, and is a favourite tiger-shooting ground. Exploration, therefore, will present serious difficulties.\n\nI now turn to the discussion of the name and topography of S\u0101het-M\u0101het. Dr. Hoey prefers to call the first element of the name Set. No doubt both forms are in use, but\nI only heard the form S\u0101het. The final consonant in both elements of the name is the cerebral \u1e5b. I think that the a in both S\u0101het and M\u0101het is long. But Hindi spelling is very lax and irregular.\n\nI confess that I feel grave doubts as to S\u0101het-M\u0101het being a genuine place-name at all. The locution means, as Cunningham duly noted, 'topsy-turvy,' or 'upside down.' Last February, when visiting the ruins of Dog\u0101m, or D\u016bgam, near N\u0101mp\u0101ra,\u00b9 one of the villagers actually used the expression sa\u1e25et-ma\u1e25et as an adjective, when explaining how Dog\u0101m had been overthrown by the curse of the local holy man (sa\u1e25et-ma\u1e25et hogay\u0101). I have therefore a suspicion that the ruins reputed to be those of \u015ar\u0101vast\u012b were originally known to the country people as the 'topsy-turvy' place. The assignment of one-half of the expression to the walled town and of the other half to the ruins of the religious edifices on the south is, I suspect, fictitious. The people now call the walled town M\u0101het and the ruins outside they call S\u0101het. In Cunningham's map the name S\u0101het is given to the walled town and M\u0101het to the outer ruins. I do not know whether this discrepancy is due to a blunder or not. However that may be, I doubt greatly if S\u0101het-M\u0101het is a genuine place-name.\u00b2\n\nS\u0101het-M\u0101het, like many other Buddhist sites, is regarded as sacred by the Jains, who believe that their third patriarch, Sambhuv\u0101th, was born there. He is known locally as Sobhn\u0101th. His image has been carried off. Dr. Hoey removed images of seven of the patriarchs from this spot.\n\n\u00b9 D\u016bgam is the local pronunciation. See Captain Vost's article on \"The Dog\u0101m Mint\" in J.A.S.B. for 1895, vol. lxiv, pt. 1, p. 69.\n\u00b2 Compare the case of B\u0101ngarmau. \"According to the legends of the people, Newal was a large and flourishing city, under a r\u0101ja named Nala, when the Musaimans first invaded the country. Saiyid Ala-ud-din bin Ghanaur came from Kanauj to Newal, and wished to settle at B\u0101ngarmau; but the r\u0101ja ordered him to go away, and sent his servants to drive him out. On this the saint cursed him, and the city was immediately destroyed by fire, leaving only ruins, which are seen at the present day.\" So firmly do the people believe this story that they affirm that all relics of the old city, no matter of what kind, are always turned up upside down. Hence the old site is generally known as Aundh\u0101-Kher\u0101, or \"Topsy-turvy town\" (Cunningham, \"Reports,\" vol. xi, p. 48). I think it probable that S\u0101het-M\u0101het is merely an equivalent for Aundh\u0101-Kher\u0101, that is to say, a nickname rather than a name.\nto Gond\u0101. The Jain name for the site is S\u0101vitri. This name was heard by Cunningham. The tahsild\u0101r who accompanied me happened to be a Jain, and gave me notes collected by his father concerning the holy places of Jainism, which record the name of S\u016bhet-M\u016bhet as S\u0101vitri nagar. The word S\u0101vitri apparently means 'the sun.' It cannot be phonetically connected with either the Sanskrit \u015ar\u0101vasti, or the P\u0101li form Savatthi, or the Sinhalese Sewet. The Hind\u016b name of the place is said to be Chandrik\u0101puri. But I am sceptical as to the genuineness of this name also. The Brahmins' legends about every holy place in India always provide it with a name, or a set of names, supposed to have belonged to it in ancient times, which names are, I think, generally imaginary. The Jain name S\u0101vitri, or S\u0101vriti nagar, is, I believe, a genuine name. The superficial resemblance to \u015ar\u0101vasti, though curious, is nothing more. The original position of Dr. Hoey's slab dated 1276 V.S. is not known. The inscription on it mentions a place named J\u0101vrisha, or Aj\u0101vrisha, but there is nothing to show where that place was.\n\nAccording to Major Waddell's Tibetan guidebook, of uncertain date, the city of \u015ar\u0101vasti was known as Kosalapuri. The writer says that \"now traces only remain of the fort.\" Nobody could call the massive and conspicuous ramparts of M\u0101het \"traces of a fort.\" He also says that \"on either side of the eastern gate of the city there is a long stone of about fifteen fathoms.\" No object of the kind has ever been heard of at M\u0101het, where the principal gates are on the south and west. I doubt if there is any gate on the eastern side. The writer of the guidebook places Kapilavastu eight or nine days' journey eastward, and so far agrees with the Chinese pilgrims. Nobody could spend eight or nine days\n\n---\n\n1 In Sanskrit s\u0101vitra (m.), \u0938\u093e\u0935\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f, means 'the sun,' and s\u0101vitr\u012b (fem.) \u0938\u093e\u0935\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0940, means 'a beam of light,' and is also a proper name (Benfey).\n2 For this statement I have the authority of Dr. Grierson.\n3 Dr. Hoey gives some doubtful reasons for supposing that Chandrik\u0101puri is a blunder for Champakapuri (Bh\u0101galpur). (p. 5.)\n4 J.A.S.B. for 1898, part i, p. 276.\ngoing from S\u0101het M\u0101het to Kapilavastu; the distance is four days' easy marching.\n\nThe annexed tracing from the map of the Gond\u0101 District shows the position of the S\u0101het-M\u0101het ruins and the relative size of the fortified town and of the S\u0101het remains. The extreme length of the walled town, now called M\u0101het, is just a mile and a half. The remains at S\u0101het, although extensive, do not seem to me to cover sufficient ground to justify the application to them of the description of the Jetavana and its surroundings. The buildings there were extremely numerous, and must have covered a great area. The tracing displays very clearly an interesting feature of the locality which has been strangely overlooked by previous visitors, the great canal connecting the R\u0101pt\u012b and Ku\u0101na rivers. The walled town was protected in old days on the north, and perhaps also on the east, by the R\u0101pt\u012b, which used to flow under the ramparts, and has cut away a portion of them. The walls in the eastern portion of the northern face are lower and weaker than the fortifications on the north-western and western side. Major Jaskaran Singh, of Balr\u0101mpur, who accompanied me on the occasion of my second visit in March, 1899, believes that these lower walls are comparatively late substitutes, perhaps dating from the time of Mahm\u016bd of Ghazni, for parts of the original fortifications cut away by the river. The country people say that masonry is found far out in the bed of the river, of which the stream has now moved a couple of miles away. The city was originally probably of a nearly rectangular shape, as indicated by the dotted line inserted in the tracing. The western rampart is still about forty feet high. The southern and western faces on which the gates were situated were protected by a broad moat supplied with water from the R\u0101pt\u012b. This moat is now for the most part rice-swamp, though clearly traceable. It communicated, as indicated by the arrow in the tracing, through ponds with the great canal six miles long running south to the Ku\u0101na river. The R\u0101pt\u012b and Ku\u0101na were thus connected. The canal was cut perfectly straight, the main bank being on the east side. Opposite the village of\nBinauni, and about half a mile or a little more from the Ikaun\u0101-Balrampur road, a massive dyke, with a silted moat on the south side, runs westward, and is said to extend for about three miles more or less distinctly visible.\u00b9\n\nAt a distance of about two miles from the road there is a second parallel dyke, which begins close to the village of Mah\u0101deiyy\u0101 and extends westwards for about three miles to the Pit\u0101niya N\u0101la. The moat or canal running alongside the southern dyke is on the northern or inner side of the dyke. A great portion of the large area enclosed by these dykes is under water in the rains. The south-eastern portion near Mah\u0101deiyy\u0101 is known as the Beor\u0101 T\u0101l.\n\nOpposite Ailaw\u0101, and about 200 yards more or less from the point where the Mah\u0101deiyy\u0101 dyke joins the canal, a wide outlet for the waters of the Beor\u0101 T\u0101l into the canal was provided, and was guarded on its southern side by a large brick building of circular outline projecting into the t\u0101l. From this point to the head of the Mah\u0101deiyy\u0101 dyke there are traces of brickwork the whole way. The village of Binauni, which itself stands on a considerable mound of ruins, is situated just south of the inner or northern dyke.\n\nMajor Jaskaran Singh, who kindly took me over these remarkable works, was full of stories of Arjuna and the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, and firmly believes that the northern dyke with its moat on the south or outside was the exterior line of defence of the town, while the southern dyke with its moat on the north or inside was the entrenchment of the besieging P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava host. He regards the Beor\u0101 T\u0101l and adjoining lands as the battlefield. I am disposed to regard the whole system as being rather a system of drainage than one of fortification.\n\nThe village of Gund\u0101pur (said to be equivalent to Govindapur) is built on a rectangular mound about ten or twelve feet above the surface of the fields, which is, I believe, the site of a monastery. A mound close to the\n\n\u00b9 The cross dykes and the hamlets of Binauni and Gund\u0101pur were not marked on the map from which I took my tracing, which therefore shows their position approximately. The canal is clearly marked on the map.\nvillage, a little north of west, seems to be a st\u016bpa, and a very low circular mound a little further west is probably an extremely ancient st\u016bpa. The bricks at Gund\u0101pur are of large size, about $15'' \\times 9\\frac{1}{2}''$, such as were used in A\u015boka's time. Another mound about half-way between Gund\u0101pur and S\u0101h\u0113\u1e6d also looks like a small st\u016bpa. There are also some remains at Katr\u0101 on the Ikaun\u0101 road about three-quarters of a mile from S\u0101h\u0113\u1e6d.\n\nThe country to the south of M\u0101he\u1e6d is noticeable for the extraordinary number of small ponds. Major Jaskaran Singh plausibly suggests that these are the spots from which earth was taken to make the vast quantity of bricks required for the various buildings. Although I do not believe in the identity of S\u0101h\u0113\u1e6d-M\u0101he\u1e6d and \u015ar\u0101vasti, I note that Fa-hian mentions the \"ponds of water clear and pure\" as one of the elements which constituted \"the lovely scene\" still presented by the Jatavana when he visited it.\n\nThe great gateway of the town, leading into what Dr. Hoey calls Broad Street, directly faced the huge st\u016bpa of Or\u0101jh\u0101r. Dr. Hoey persuaded himself that this building was a \"terraced palace,\" but it is undoubtedly a large st\u016bpa, as stated by Cunningham. The little building on the north side of the road known as Panahiy\u0101 jh\u0101r, in which Dr. Hoey excavated \"3 concentric rings of brick wall,\" and which he fancifully calls \"a cockpit,\" is doubtless the base of a st\u016bpa.\n\nThe inner structure of st\u016bpas varied greatly, and many various devices were adopted by builders to secure stability and at the same time to economize masonry. I did not happen to see the Panahiy\u0101 jh\u0101r.\n\nIn the walled town, now called M\u0101he\u1e6d, the two most remarkable ruins are the so-called Pakk\u0101 and Kachha Ku\u1e6di.\u00b9 The northern ruin, or Pakk\u0101 Ku\u1e6di, was identified by Cunningham as the Angulim\u0101lya st\u016bpa, but Dr. Hoey correctly observes that beyond the size and prominence of the mound there is no ground for this identification. Dr. Hoey drove a gallery through the basement right from\n\n\u00b9 The word ku\u1e6di is applied to the residence of a fakir, or holy man. Both the mounds in question have been occupied by fakirs.\none side to the other, and ascertained that the building is constructed of compartments formed by brick walls filled in with earth. He whimsically seeks to identify this solid mass with the \"Hall of the Law.\" The building is obviously, as Cunningham rightly observed, a st\u016bpa. The circular courses are quite distinctly traceable on the western side. If there is a deposit, Dr. Hoey's tunnel failed to hit it, probably missing the true centre by a few feet. The division into compartments is merely a device of construction.\n\nThe Kachha Kut\u012b, about 25 feet in height, is called the st\u016bpa of Sudatta by Cunningham, whereas Dr. Hoey thinks it was a private residence, or the house of Sudatta. The partial excavation made by Dr. Hoey shows that the building stood on a massive brick rectangular plinth, highly decorated with mouldings and panels, which latter contained terracotta statuary. The entrance was to the west. The approach was by a ramp, or slope, paved with brick set on edge, of which a small portion still remains. A more recent building has been thrown right across the lower portion of this ramp. Accordingly, where the north and south sides of the ramp were partially excavated the excavations produce the false impression of being chambers, owing to their being closed in by the comparatively late mass of brickwork on the west and the plinth on the east.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 See photographs on view at the Society. A man is standing on the pavement. The annexed diagram explains my meaning.\nThe Jain L\u0101h\u016bl\u0101r who accompanied me at once said that\nthe plinth looked like that of a Jain temple, and he is\nprobably right. The building was certainly either a temple\nor a stage resting on a decorated rectangular plinth. The\nnature of the upper structure cannot be made out. It\nhas been modified by the takirs who have taken up their\nresidence there. The herring-bone brick pavement made of\nbricks set on edge \"may have been,\" remarks Dr. Hoey,\n\"either a graduated approach to a building or a roof\noverlying a passage into one.\" I opened enough of it\nto satisfy myself that it is a graduated approach or\npassage ramp.\n\nDr. Hoey selected another mound near as being the\nAngulim\u0101lya site. The great discrepancy between his\nvarious identifications and the equally fanciful identifications\nof Cunningham shows that neither explorer was on\nsolid ground. Both firmly believed in the identity of S\u0101het-\nM\u0101het with S\u0101vatthi, and having plenty of mounds to choose\nfrom, allowed their fancy to play and made a selection of\nparticular mounds as the equivalent of particular ancient\nbuildings.\n\nWhen working at the S\u0101het mounds, Dr. Hoey (p. 51)\ncame to the conclusion that the lowest level seen by General\nCunningham was about fifteen feet above the original\nground level, and remarked that this fact shows how much\nexcavation has to be done before we are entitled to speculate\non the identity of particular ruins with the Gandha Ku\u1e6di\nor Kosambh\u0101 Ku\u1e6di of the Buddhist books.\n\nThough, I think, has been said to establish the proposition\nthat not a single building in either S\u0101het or M\u0101het has been\nsatisfactorily identified with any building of \u015ar\u0101vasti. The\nso-called identifications are mere guesses, more or less\nplausible, not sustained in any instance by proof. They\nall rest on the same assumption that S\u0101het-M\u0101het and\n\u015ar\u0101vasti are identical. That assumption rests mainly on the\ndescription of the Bodhisattva statue, and has been feebly\nsupported by clearly fallacious geographical arguments,\ninaccurate etymologies, and unsubstantial conjectures.\nThe general conformation, extent, and position of the ruins at S\u0101het-M\u0101het do not agree with the pilgrims' description of \u015ar\u0101vasti.\n\nHiuen Tsiang says:\u2014\"The kingdom of \u015ar\u0101vasti is about 6000 li in circuit. The chief town is desert and ruined. There is no record as to its exact limits (area). The ruins of the walls encompassing the royal precincts give a circuit of about 20 li. There are several hundreds of sangh\u0101r\u0101mas, mostly in ruins. . . . There are 100 Deva temples. . . .\nTo the south of the city 5 or 6 li is the Jetavana. . . .\nBy the side of the st\u016bpa commemorating the slaughter of the S\u0101kyas, and not far from it, is a great lake which has dried up. . . . To the north-west of the capital 16 li or so, there is an old town\" with a st\u016bpa to the south, and another to the north containing relics of the entire body of K\u0101\u015byapa Buddha. (Beal, ii, 1\u201313.)\n\nFa-hian places the Jetavana about 1,200 paces from the south gate of the city, and mentions that there were ninety-eight monasteries according to tradition around the Jetavana vih\u0101ra. He places the town and st\u016bpa of K\u0101\u015byapa 50 li to the west of the city.\n\nCunningham, when describing the well-preserved ramparts of the walled town M\u0101het, was conscious of the discrepancy between the facts and the description, and tried to get round the difficulty. \"The whole circuit of the old earthen 'ramparts,'\" he writes, \"according to my survey, is 17,300 feet, or upwards of $3\\frac{1}{2}$ miles. Now this is the exact size of 20 li or $3\\frac{1}{2}$ miles which Hiuen Thsang gives to the palace ['royal precincts,' Beal] alone; but as the city was then deserted and in ruins he must have mistaken the city for the palace. It is certain at least that the suburbs outside the walls must have been very limited indeed, as the place is almost entirely surrounded with the remains of large religious buildings, which would have left but little room for any private dwellings. I am therefore quite satisfied that the city has been mistaken for the palace; and this mistake is sufficient to show how utterly ruined this once famous city must have been at so distant a period as\nthe seventh century, when the place was visited by Hiuen Thsang.\"\n\nNow the walled enclosure of M\u0101het (see sketch-map) is the ruin of a complete town, not of a palace or royal precincts. The great street leading from the main gate opposite Or\u0101jh\u0101r, which Dr. Hoey conveniently calls Broad Street, was clearly the main street of the town. The citadel or palace was evidently in the west end, where no excavations have been attempted, and the jungle has not been cleared. The town was complete in itself. It is not accurate to say that it was almost entirely surrounded with the remains of large religious buildings. No such buildings ever existed on the north side, the river face. On the east there are no ruins at all near, except a single st\u016bpa or temple on the bank of the tal or shallow lake beyond the camping-ground, and about a mile from the town. To the west there are no remains to speak of. Or\u0101jh\u0101r, S\u0101het, Gund\u0101pur, Binauni, and practically all the outlying remains, are on one side only of the town, namely the south. But it is true that there are no signs of the existence of anything that can be called a town outside the walls.\n\nTo suit Hiuen Tsiang's description we should have a wide undefined area of city ruins extending to a long distance from the walled 'royal precincts.' There is nothing of the sort at S\u0101het-M\u0101het. But when Dr. Vost and I walked over the ruins near our camp at B\u0101lapur, the remains were so worn down by time that we had to look carefully at the ground and watch for minute fragments of brick to ascertain when we were within the limits of the old town. The little that we saw presented an appearance of very great antiquity, and the remains were certainly undefined in extent. The remains at S\u0101het-M\u0101het may be concisely described as those of a strongly fortified town of moderate size, with extensive religious establishments on the south in a space enclosed by great dykes.\n\nCunningham's hypothesis that Hiuen Tsiang mistook the palace for the town seems to me undeserving of serious consideration.\n\n1 \"Reports,\" vol. i, p. 331.\nThe ruins at S\u0101het, even if we include those at Gund\u0101pur, Binauni, and other places not included in Cunningham's survey, do not seem to me at all large enough to agree with the descriptions by the pilgrims. The town gate opposite S\u0101het is quite a minor one, the main gate is far to the east, and faces Or\u0101jh\u0101r. The next most important gate is that on the west side.\n\nAs to the distance of the Jetavana, the actual distance of S\u0101het from the ramparts agrees sufficiently well with Fa-hian's estimate of 1,200 paces, but is much too short for the estimate of the more accurate Hiuen Tsiang, who gives the distance as five or six li, that is to say, about a mile. If the site of \u015ar\u0101vasti is ever surveyed I believe that the ruins of the Jetavana and its surroundings will be found covering a very large area about a mile from the main city gate.\n\nAs to K\u0101\u015byapa's town and st\u016bpa the pilgrims differ seriously in their statement of the distance. Cunningham follows Fa-hian's lead, and fixes on Tandwa as the site. I cannot stop to discuss this identification beyond remarking that it is unconvincing.\n\nTwo details in Hiuen Tsiang's narrative seem to me to indicate that \u015ar\u0101vasti was near the foot of the mountains. After describing the fate of Devadatta and the other sinners who were swallowed up by the earth, he says: \"These three ditches are unfathomable in their depth; when the floods of summer and autumn fill all the lakes and ponds with water, these deep caverns show no signs of the water standing in them.\" Such a phenomenon might well occur at the foot of the hills. It cannot be made intelligible when the description is applied to the ordinary ponds south of M\u0101het.\n\nThe other indication is given by the story of the blinded robbers. \"At this time Tath\u0101gata was in the vih\u0101ra of the Jetavana, and hearing their pitcous cries he was moved to compassion, and caused a soft wind to blow from the Snowy Mountains [Him\u0101laya]\" and heal them. This legend indicates the proximity of the mountains.\nIn another publication I have remarked that \"there is no reason whatever to doubt the accuracy of Hiuen Tsiang's account of places which he personally visited, and when his account is inconsistent with local facts, an identification based on an attempt to force the facts into agreement with the account must be rejected.\" On the other hand, arbitrary emendations of the pilgrims' texts in order to make them agree with the local facts of places assumed to be identical with those visited by the pilgrims are equally uncritical and unsatisfactory.\n\nFor Fa-hian, besides the old versions of R\u00e9musat and Laidlay, we now have the versions of Beal, Giles, and Legge. The translation by Professor Legge is from a Corean text, the other translations are from Chinese texts. The testimony of Fa-hian cannot safely be called until these versions have been compared, and that which appears to be the best has been selected. For Hiuen Tsiang we have the translations of Beal and Julien. The earlier version of the great French scholar is a very useful check on the renderings of Mr. Beal. Occasionally, even when all available critical sources open to a student ignorant of Chinese have been exhausted, the conclusion becomes inevitable that there is an error in the text. That error may be due to an original blunder of the observer, to mistakes in transcription of the Chinese text, or to imperfect interpretation. But I believe that such errors are few. Fa-hian is undoubtedly very lax in his indications of direction, and when he says \"east\" he may mean any direction east of a north and south meridian. This laxness of expression must be allowed for, and when Fa-hian says \"east,\" while the more precise Hiuen Tsiang says \"north-east,\" the statement of the more precise writer should ordinarily be preferred.\n\nIn statements as to distance both pilgrims are generally, so far as I have observed\u2014and I have studied large parts of their writings with great minuteness\u2014equally trustworthy. Fa-hian counts by yojanas, Hiuen Tsiang counts by li. When both writers, using these different forms of expression, agree substantially in the result, we are bound to accept\nthat result as correct unless there is the clearest evidence to prove it wrong.\n\nConcerning the position of Sr\u0101vasti relatively to Kapilavastu, the two pilgrims, as proved above, agree in this manner, and must not be disbelieved until the critic can give some plausible explanation for the agreement of the two writers in error, and can produce conclusive evidence that the error exists.\n\nAt Benares, R\u0101jgir, Bar\u0101g\u0101on (N\u0101landa), and many other places, the identification of which is certain, the accuracy of the observations of the pilgrims, and especially of Hiuen Tsiang, has been proved in innumerable instances. A very striking confirmation of the accuracy of both Fa-hian and Hiuen Tsiang has been afforded by the recent discovery and exploration of the Lumbini Garden (Rummin Dei). The local details agree admirably with the pilgrims' descriptions.\n\nDr. Stein's hurried tour with the Buner Field Force has proved that even when the scantiest allowance of time was available for exploration the itinerary of Hiuen Tsiang served as an accurate guidebook and permitted of the satisfactory identification of all the principal sites.\u00b9\n\nTherefore, I repeat, sound principles of criticism require us ordinarily to accept the statements of each of the two Chinese pilgrims, Fa-hian and Hiuen Tsiang, in the first instance, as they stand. In the case of Fa-hian the two texts, represented by three versions, should be compared, and the best selected as his testimony. When Fa-hian differs, or appears to differ, from Hiuen Tsiang, the apparent difference should be closely examined to see if it cannot be reconciled. I can cite cases in which such divergences, which at first sight appear large, can be reduced to very narrow limits. If the difference is irreconcilable, the testimony of Hiuen Tsiang is generally to be preferred. But, in order to be certain what his testimony is, it is\n\n\u00b9 \"Detailed Report of an Archaeological Tour with the Buner Field Force,\" by M. A.

When the \"Life of Hiuen Tsiang\" disagrees, as it often does, with the \"Records of Western Countries\" (Si-yu-ki), the testimony of the \"Records\" is to be preferred. When these strict principles of criticism are applied I venture to say that the number of legitimate and necessary emendations in the text either of Fa-hian or of Hiuen Tsiang will not be large. Arbitrary emendations made to suit preconceived theories are wholly inadmissible.\n\nFlysted, June 25, 1899.\n\nPOSTSCRIPT.\n\nAfter I had passed for press the proofs of my paper, I happened to come upon the record of the transport of a heavy image, probably in the twelfth century, over a distance of about seventy miles, which affords a striking parallel to the event which according to my belief occurred at S\u0101het-M\u0101het.\n\nAt a place called Lon\u0101r, nearly twelve miles south of Mehkar in the Buld\u0101n\u0101 District of Ber\u0101r, there is a group of temples adjoining a remarkable salt lake. The sanctuary of the finest of these temples is occupied by an erect statue of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, described as standing on a \"pedestal apparently original,\" which image is said to have been brought from N\u0101gpur at very great cost. The Lon\u0101r temples are believed to date from the twelfth century.\n\nThe direct distance from Lon\u0101r to N\u0101gpur is not less than seventy miles. If somebody in Ber\u0101r thought it worth while to transport a heavy image seventy miles or more across country, there is no reason to hesitate in believing that somebody in Oudh took the trouble of moving a statue fifty miles when water carriage was available.\u00b9\n\nV.

II.\u2014Aswakranta, near Ganhati. By Captain P. R. Gurdon, I.S.C., M.R.A.S.\n\nAmongst the many interesting places that lie near the old town of Pragjotishpur or Ganhati is Aswakranta, or, as some people call it, Aswaklanta. It is called Aswakranta because the route of Krishna is said to have been via Aswakranta when he was carrying off his bride, Rukmini (Aswa 'horse' and kranta (\u0905\u0902\u0924\u0903) 'passed by'). If it is called Aswaklanta, it means the place where the horse was tired; klanta meaning 'tired' or 'weary.' It should also be remembered that r and l are often interchangeable. Compare Sukreshwar, which is often called Sukleshwar. Aswakranta, or Aswaklanta, is on the north side of the Brahmaputra, a little to the west of the island of Umananda, which lies in the midst of the mighty Brahmaputra. The people at the temple show you various holes in the rock at Aswakranta, which, they say, are the footprints of Krishna's horses. It is at this place that the people bathe during the Asokastami festival, the day when the current of the Brahmaputra is thought to flow backwards, the reverse current being popularly supposed to be the holy Gang\u00e4. The origin of the festival is said to be due to Aswakranta having been the bathing-place of Rukmini. This goddess bathed in the river, but was annoyed by people staring at her from the opposite bank, upon which Krishna promptly interposed what is now known as the \"Ar parbat\" as a screen. Another explanation of the \"Ar parbat\" is that it is unlucky to look upon the rocks of Karmanasa (near Umananda). These rocks no longer became visible when the \"Ar parbat\" was interposed. At the foot of the Aswakranta hill there is a small and ruined temple. There\nis very little left in the way of architecture, but it was here that I found the Garurasan, or stone throne shown in Plate I. At each corner of the throne are kneeling figures, all of which have the heads of birds. These strange figures are said to represent the 'Garuda,' or sacred bird of Vishnu.\n\nTo see the Ananta-Sajya entails a stiff climb up stone steps which since the great earthquake of 1897 have become all on the slant. The temple of Vishnu has been ruined by the earthquake, but the wonderful carving which is shown in Plate II remains intact. This carving is on a black stone and is of exquisite workmanship. The subject of the carving is the sleep of Vishnu whilst resting on the snake Ananta. In the fifth book, chapter xxv, of the Srimat Bhagavat, the following description of the Ananta Sajya (literally the Ananta bed) is found:\u2014\"The Great God who is the Creator of the universe and the first cause, by an incarnation (partial), became the snake god, Ananta, with one thousand heads, and rules over the nether regions (Patal) and supports himself on the water below. The Great God, when wishing to destroy the Universe for the purpose of recreation, eventually rested on the Ananta, and there he slept. Ages rolled on in this way.\" Then the Pur\u0101\u1e47as relate how a frog, a tortoise, a piece of water weed respectively support the Ananta upon which the Great God slept.\n\nHere it may be remarked that the name of the God N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is popularly (and wrongly) derived from this legend, as if it meant n\u0101r\u0101 'water' and \u0101ya\u1e47 'orbit.' Whilst N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a slept upon the Ananta his will was done, i.e. the Universe was destroyed and the work of recreation commenced. The will of Vishnu was manifested in Brahma as Creator, and it is the God Brahma who is depicted as sitting on the lotus which has sprung from the navel of Vishnu. Brahma, bewildered at seeing nothing but water, dived down into the depths for 100 years. When he rose to the surface he heard a voice from heaven say Tapas tapa (\"Do penance\"). He did so, and he beheld Mah\u0101m\u0101y\u0101 on the one hand and \u015aiva on the other.\nMah\u0101m\u0101y\u0101 gave him 'Sakti,' or energy to create, and \u015aiva destroyed the surplus population. The stone carving depicted in the photograph depicts this Hindu theory of the creation.\n\nThe priest of the temple still keeps up some semblance of worship before this wonderful carving; but the carving has been exposed to wind and weather since the earthquake, and it will soon crumble away unless some shelter is put up over it. This would be well worth doing. The female kneeling figures of Plate II are the N\u0101gkany\u0101, or the daughters of the Snake. Some of them have already lost their heads.\nART.

Concentration is an initiatory light of religion which makes people lean on the glorious religion of Buddha.\u201d\n\nAgain:\n\nAsmin Mah\u0101y\u0101ne sa t\u0101\u1e41 mahatim bodhisattvadeva-par\u1e63adam etad avocat.\u00b9\n\n\u201cIn this great vehicle he said to the large assembly of Bodhisattvas and Devas as follows.\u201d\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 Lalitavistara, p. 25.\n\u00b2 [This passage is manifestly corrupt. And it makes no better sense if the words \u2018in this Mah\u0101y\u0101na\u2019 are taken to the preceding clause. Professor Bendall has been kind enough to compare the Tibetan version, and informs me that an adjective meaning \u2018firm in\u2019 seems to have been omitted. The right translation would then be simply \u2018He, firm in this great vehicle, said,\u2019 etc.\u2014Rt.

The people of the little vehicle (Hinay\u0101na) are afraid of death at every step; their achievement of victory in war lies indeed very far off.\n\n53. The man of the great vehicle (Mah\u0101y\u0101na) is clad with the armour of mercy; he, intent on saving the world, is fully equipped with the bow and arrows of sympathy and morality.\n\n54. Great in force, efficient in means, firm in purpose, freed from slothfulness, he comes out victorious from the terrible war and brings about the emancipation of others.\n\n55. For the sake of selfish interest even the beasts undergo pains, but it is only those few people who suffer pains for the sake of the world that deserve our thanks.\n\n56. In securing their selfish ends people submit to suffering from cold and wind: why, then, do they not desire to undergo sufferings for the sake of the world?\n\n\u00b9 H. P. Shastri's Discovery of a work by Arya-deva, Journal of the Bengal Asiatic Society, vol. lxvii, pt. 1, No. 2, 1898.\n57. Even the miseries of hell should be borne by the kind-hearted; who cares for the sufferings arising from cold and wind?\n\n58. No one should meditate injury to others, none should observe fasting or ceremonies, none should care for the purity of bathing; all pagan observances should be avoided.\n\n59. The nails, teeth, bones, and nerves grow up from the semen of the father; while the flesh, blood, and hair, etc., grow up from the blood of the mother.\n\n60. Thus this lump of flesh (this body) is produced by impure substances and remains full of them. Being of that nature, how can it be purified by bathing in the Ganges?\n\n61. An impure water-pot, though washed again and again by water, cannot be rendered pure; so the lump full of impurities (the body) can never be rendered pure.\n\n62. A dog, though he cross the Ganges by swimming, does not deserve to be considered pure; much more is bathing in holy places absolutely useless to the good.\n\n63. If bathing can confer merit, fishermen are very meritorious; not to speak of the fishes and others who are immersed in water day and night.\n\n64. It is certain that from bathing sin is not even dissipated, because lust, hatred, etc., are found existing in people who are in the habit of making pilgrimages.\"\n\nIn the above verses the followers of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na are characterized as being merciful and liberal, and always determined to save the people of the world; while it is the followers of the Hinay\u0101na who are apparently spoken of as being selfish, and as observing ritualistic ceremonies, such as bathing in the Ganges, making pilgrimages, etc. Now, it may be asked, was it not the Brahmans and other\nTirthikas that preached the efficacy of bathing in the Ganges, making pilgrimages, etc. Can it be possible that to \u0100rya-deva the term Hinay\u0101na included the followers of Brahmanism? On this compare \u015a\u0101nti-deva, who, in his Bodhi-cary\u0101vat\u0101ra, says:\n\nNanv asiddham Mah\u0101y\u0101nam katham siddhas tvad \u0101gamah |\nYasm\u0101d ubhaya-siddho 'sau na siddho 'sau tav\u0101dit\u0101\u1e25 ||42||\n\nYat-pratyay\u0101 ca tatr\u0101sth\u0101 Mah\u0101y\u0101ne 'pi t\u0101m kuru |\nAnyobbhaye\u1e63\u1e6da-satyatve ved\u0101de\u015b api satya\u015b || 43 ||\n\nSaviv\u0101dam Mah\u0101y\u0101nam iti ced \u0101gamam tyaja |\nT\u012brthikai\u1e25 saviv\u0101datv\u0101 svai\u1e25 para\u015b c\u0101gam\u0101ntarap || 44 ||\u00b9\n\n\"42. If the great vehicle (Mah\u0101y\u0101na) is not inadmissible, how is your tradition admissible? For the reason for which you rely on your books, treat the Mah\u0101y\u0101na in the same manner. Authorities must be acknowledged as authorities, and it is not yours alone that should be regarded as being so.\n\n43. The grounds which have led you to cherish faith in your \u015a\u0101stras should lead you to cherish the same in the Mah\u0101y\u0101na too. It is on account of the very infallibility vested in both these doctrines that your Vedas also derive their authority.\n\n44. If the Mah\u0101y\u0101na \u015a\u0101stra is to be rejected as being full of contradictions and inconsistencies, then the \u015a\u0101stra of the Tirthikas is also to be rejected on the very same ground of contradictions and inconsistencies being contained therein.\"\n\nThe Mah\u0101y\u0101na was also called Cira-y\u0101na, Bodhisattva-y\u0101na, Eka-y\u0101na, Buddha-y\u0101na, Prathama-y\u0101na, agra-y\u0101na, uttama-y\u0101na, \u015bre\u1e63\u1e6dha-y\u0101na, and so forth.

It is called Mah\u0101y\u0101na because it will lead gods, men, and demons, being as spacious as the sky. Just as the sky may be a receptacle for immeasurable and innumerable objects, so also, O Lord, this vehicle (y\u0101na) is a receptacle for immense and innumerable sentient beings (sattva). In this book, O Lord, the Mah\u0101-y\u0101na is to be understood to be a receptacle for the Bodhisattvas alone. It is not seen whence it comes, whither it goes, and where it stops. Thus, O Lord, neither the beginning, nor end, nor middle of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na is perceptible. This vehicle (y\u0101na), O Lord, is of equal dimensions throughout. It is for these reasons that the Mah\u0101y\u0101na is called Mah\u0101-y\u0101na, great vehicle.'\"\n\nAgain:\n\nYe ca khalu punar ime \u0101yu\u1e63man Subh\u016bte trayo Bodhi-sattvay\u0101nik\u0101\u1e25 pudgal\u0101\u1e25.

The Mah\u0101y\u0101nists were, on the other hand, described as being those whose longings for the world were completely extinct, and whose exertions were wholly devoted to the deliverance of their fellow-men.\n\nFrom the above we may perhaps draw the conclusion that in the earliest Mah\u0101y\u0101na books the authors looked upon every view of life, different from their own, as Hinay\u0101na, the meaner, lower, lesser vehicle. They did not confine it exclusively to designate other Buddhists. But from the fourth century downwards, in the period of Hindu revival, when Buddhism, waning in India, was spreading rapidly in adjoining and other countries, and the demand for missionaries became great, the word Mah\u0101y\u0101nist meant especially those who were willing to go forth as preachers to save the world; and Hinay\u0101nist meant especially a Buddhist who would not, or did not, do this. It never meant the Buddhists of Ceylon, Burma, and Siam.\nNOTE BY PROFESSOR C. BENDALL.\n\nAs the foregoing paper was submitted to me by the Council for opinion, I subjoin at the request of the acting editor of the Journal some notes upon it.\n\nThe collection of passages from books mainly untranslated is in itself interesting; but with the chief conclusion, as to the meaning of 'Hinay\u0101na,' few serious students will, I think, agree.\n\nThe key to one of the chief difficulties is to be found in a passage, clearly from an early Mah\u0101y\u0101na-s\u016btra, presented in the Mah\u0101vyutpati (\u00a7 10. 32), the most authoritative of the old glossaries of Buddhist Sanskrit, where we read:\n\n\"v\u012b\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6daparinar\u0101\u1e47\u0101rtham satv\u0101 hinay\u0101nam pr\u0101rthayante yad idam \u015br\u0101vakapratyekabuddhay\u0101nam,\" 'creatures seek after the Hinay\u0101na, to wit, the y\u0101na of the \u015ar\u0101vakas and Pratyeka-buddhas.'\n\nThis explanation brings several of the above passages well into line with the usually received view as to the two main divisions of Buddhist thought. The extract from \u0100ryadeva\u00b9 is both interesting and humorous, but I cannot see that in stanzas 60\u201364 the Hinay\u0101nists are still spoken of.\n\nIt is not clear to me what the author means to prove by his quotation from Bodhic., IX. 42\u201344. I may mention, however, that the commentary printed in de la Vall\u00e9e Poussin's \"Bouddhisme,\" pp. 282 seqq., understands the disputants to be Buddhists, as the point is, what is 'approved' (siddham) as being the 'word' of Buddha (Bhagavad-vacanam . . . Buddhavacanam). In the next verses non-Buddhists are introduced by way of illustration; Ved\u0101di is explained as meaning \"the Vedas, the S\u0101\u1e45khya writings, and so on,\" while the tirthikas are \"Mim\u0101\u1e43sakas and others.\"\n\n\u00b9 The poem is called, as I have recently discovered from a Buddhist anthology, Cittavisuddhiprakara\u1e47a.\u2014C. B.\nBut we have fortunately other means for determining the question as to the real meaning of the terms Mah\u0101y\u0101na and Hinay\u0101na.\n\nThe testimony of the Chinese Pilgrims seems quite clear. I-tsing's notes (at pp. 14, 15 of Takakusu's translation of his \"Record\") on the local distribution, the points of union (e.g. the Vinaya, the five skandhas, the four \u0101ryasatyaes) and disunion (worship of Bodhisattvas) leave hardly a doubt as to what he thought. Other passages may be found through Takakusu's index, s.v. Hinay\u0101na. As for Hiuen Tsang, he goes through the Buddhist world classifying countries and monasteries, according to the 'Great' or 'Little' Vehicle.\n\nFrom monuments the testimony is less conclusive, but no intelligent traveller has much difficulty in recognizing the Mah\u0101y\u0101na caves with their images of Avalokite\u015bvara and Padmap\u0101ni. It would be interesting to work out this latter line in detail, with inscriptions.\n\nAs to the writer's concluding sentence, it is too much to expect topographical information on distant countries from authors like the Indian Mah\u0101y\u0101na doctors, but as to Ceylon it may be worth while to note here that recent discoveries, archaeological and literary, have disclosed the real existence of worshippers of Avalokite\u015bvara in the island, so that the rather confused tradition recorded by Hiuen Tsang, though questioned by Beal (\"Buddhist Records,\" ii, p. 247, n. 18), may still have an element of truth. However the facts may have been, the important point for us now is that Hiuen Tsang does (if he be correctly translated) describe some of the 'Buddhists of Ceylon' as of 'the Little Vehicle.'\nART. IV.\u2014Translation of the Japji. By M. Macauliffe, M.R.A.S., I.C.S. (retired).\n\nThe Japji is the prayer which must be repeated every morning by all true Sikhs. It was composed by Baba Nanak in advanced years, and gives a brief summary of his idea of God, religion, ethics, and cosmogony. His views on these subjects are found much further expanded in his other compositions incorporated in the Ad Granth. The Sikhs regard the Japji as the key to the teaching of the early Gurus.\n\nLast year I printed and privately circulated among learned Sikhs a rough translation of the Japji for the favour of correction and return. The translation was returned to me with corrections and suggestions by very many learned and distinguished Sikhs, among whom I may mention His Highness Prince Ripdaman Singh (Tikka Sahib of Nabha), Baba Sumer Singh (Mahant, Patna Sahib), Sirdar Lilaram Watanmal (Subordinate Judge, Sind), Sirdar Kahn Singh of Nabha, Sirdar Aya Singh (District Judge, Punjab), Bhais Bhagwan Singh and Hazara Singh of Amritsar, Bhai Avatar Singh, Bhai Lachhman Singh, and others whom I beg to thank for the assistance rendered me. The corrections and suggestions received I have now placed before several gyanis or professional interpreters of the Granth Sahib, at the head of whom is Bhai Sardul Singh Gyani, Amritsar; and the result is the following amended translation. My gyanis have not been able to accept all the corrections and suggestions received, because some very obviously did not suit the context; but all of them have been carefully considered, and none rejected, it is believed, without sufficient reason.\nThe Japji is perhaps one of the most difficult of human compositions. The notes appended to the translation may give some, but only a very inadequate, idea of the struggle the gyanis and myself have had with the text. The Ad Granth, also called the Granth Sahib, is now unintelligible to the great mass of the Sikhs, and in a generation or two there will be hardly any gyanis left, and the Sikh religion will be lost, or have become absorbed, in Hinduism if there be no translation now made in some literary language.\n\nTHE JAPJI.\n\nThere is but one God whose name is true, the Creator,\\(^1\\) devoid of fear and enmity, immortal, unborn, self-existent;\\(^2\\) by the favour of the Guru.\\(^3\\)\n\nRepeat His name.\n\nThe True One was in the beginning; the True One was in the primal age.\n\nThe True One is\\(^4\\) now also, O Nanak,\\(^5\\) the True One also shall be.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) \\textit{Purusha}. It is perhaps not necessary to translate the word \\textit{purusha}. It means male or creative agency. The all-pervading spirit in union with a female element uttered a word from which sprang creation. In the Granth Sahib the Gurus speak of God as male and themselves as females.\n\n\\(^2\\) \\textit{Bhagwan} is derived from the Sanskrit \\textit{bhagavan}, which I have found in this passage in an ancient Sikh MS.\n\n\\(^3\\) \\textit{Deva}. I have translated these words in deference to the opinions of the majority of the Sikhs; but with several learned gyanis I have no doubt that they were intended as epithets of God, the great and bountiful. Vide Capeller's Sanskrit Dictionary under the words \\textit{gur} and \\textit{prasadicit}. Guru Nanak had no human guru, his guru was God. It was during the spiritual supremacy of his successors the favour of the Guru was invoked, and deemed indispensable for deliverance.\n\n\\(^4\\) \\textit{Hai}. 'also.' There are two \\textit{hai}s in this line which some say are idiomatic. I have very little doubt that the first \\textit{hai} is an obsolete past tense of the defective verb \\textit{ha}. So that the verse ought to be translated\u2014The True One is, was, and shall be.\n\n\\(^5\\) In oriental poetical works it is usual for the poet to insert his real or assumed name in the end of a composition or section of a composition. This\nI.\n\nBy thinking I cannot obtain a conception of Him, even though I think hundreds of thousands of times.\nEven though I be silent and keep my attention firmly fixed on Him, I cannot preserve silence.\nHungry for God, my hunger ceaseth not though I obtain the load of the worlds.\nIf man should have thousands and hundreds of thousands of devices, even one would not assist him in obtaining God.\nHow shall man become true before God? How shall the veil of falsehood be rent?\nBy walking, O Nanak, according to the will of the Commander as preordained.\n\nII.\n\nBy His order bodies are produced; His order cannot be described.\nBy His order souls are infused into them; by His order greatness is obtained.\nBy His order men are high or low; by His order they obtain preordained pain or pleasure.\nBy His order some obtain their reward; by His order others must ever wander in transmigration.\nAll are subject to His order; none is exempt from it.\nHe who understandeth God's order, O Nanak, is never guilty of egotism.\n\npractice is unknown to European poets except in the case of professed imitators of Oriental poetry. Were I therefore to omit the word 'Nanak' wherever it occurs, I should be consulting the taste of European readers, but the Sikhs do not desire such an omission.\n\n1. *Lai*, the Sanscrit *lipsa*, 'longing.' It sometimes appears to correspond to the English word 'love.'\n2. Also translated\u2014How shall the line of falsehood be broken?\n3. *Raaj*, *raaj*, the Arabic *raaj*, the divine pleasure.\n4. In these two lines some suppose *akar* to refer to the non-sentient, *jir* to the sentient world.\n5. That is, to be blended with God.\n6. Literally, would not be guilty of saying *haam main*, i.e., I exist by myself independently of God. This is the sin of spiritual pride.\nIII.\n\nWho can sing His power?

Some translate the word \u2018excellent\u2019, and make it an epithet of \u015braddh\u0101.\n\u2074 The preceding lines of this pauri are also translated:\u2014\nSome sing His power according to their abilities;\nSome sing His gifts according to their knowledge of His signs;\nSome sing His attributes, His greatness, and His deeds;\nSome sing His knowledge whose study is arduous;\nSome sing that He fashioneth the body and again destroyeth it;\nSome that He taketh away the soul and again restoreth it;\nSome that He appeareth far from mortal gaze;\nSome that He is all-seeing and omnipresent.\n\u2075 Also translated - His attributes are described in endless languages.\nThen what can we offer Him whereby His court may be seen?\nWhat words shall we utter with our lips, on hearing which He may love us?\nAt the ambrosial hour of morning meditate on the true name and God's greatness.\nThe Kind One will give us a robe of honour, and by His favour we shall reach the gate of salvation.\\(^1\\)\nNanak, we shall thus know that God is altogether true.\\(^2\\)\n\nV.\n\nHe is not established, nor is He created.\nThe pure one existeth by Himself.\nThey who worshipped Him have obtained honour.\nNanak, sing the praises of Him, who is the Treasury of excellencies.\nSing and hear and put His love in your hearts.\nThus shall your sorrows be removed, and you shall be absorbed in Him who is the abode of happiness.\\(^3\\)\nUnder the Guru's instruction God's word is heard; under the Guru's instruction its knowledge is acquired; under the Guru's instruction man learns that God is everywhere contained.\\(^4\\)\nThe Guru is Shiva; the Guru is Vishnu and Brahma; the Guru is Parbati, Lakhshmi, and Saraswati.\\(^5\\)\n\n\\(^1\\) This verse is also translated\u2014By our former acts we acquire this human nature, and by God's favour reach the gate of salvation.\n\\(^2\\) This verse is commonly translated\u2014We shall then know that God is all in all Himself\u2014but this translation does not appear to harmonize with the preceding part of the pauri.\n\\(^3\\) Also translated\u2014And you shall take happiness to your homes.\n\\(^4\\) This very difficult verse is also translated\u2014\n   (1) The voice of God is heard as well in other compositions as in the Vedas; the voice of God is all-pervading.\n   (2) The pious knew the Guru's instruction, that God is everywhere contained.\n   (3) The voice of the Guru is as the Vedas for the holy; they are absorbed in it.\n\\(^5\\) This verse is also translated\u2014\n   (1) He is greater than Shiva; greater than Vishnu and Brahma; greater than Parbati, Lakhshmi, and Saraswati.\n   (2) For the holy the Guru is Shiva; the Guru is Vishnu and Brahma; the Guru is Parbati, Lakhshmi, and Saraswati.\nThe tenth Guru says: \"Khanda prithme saj ke Jin sab sansar upaiya.\" (God\nIf I knew Him, should I not describe Him?

V.\u2014An Autograph of the Mogul Emperor Jah\u00e1ngir (A.D. 1617). By A. N. WOLLASTON, C.I.E.\n\nAt p. 115 of Mr. William Foster's admirable edition of Sir Thomas Roe's Journal of his Embassy to the Court of the Great Mogul, 1615-1619, recently published by the Hakluyt Society, there is an engraving representing (amongst others) the Emperor Jah\u00e1ngir.\n\nAt the foot of the picture in question is the following inscription, which appears to be of sufficient interest to merit a few words as to its probable meaning, and the inferences which may be drawn therefrom.\n\nIt may be well to quote the first paragraph of the editor's remarks concerning the engraving. He says (p. 562):\n\n\"This plate has been copied from 'Purchas His Pilgrimes,' vol. ii, p. 1474, where it appears as an illustration to Terry's short sketch of his Indian experiences. As indicated in the superscription, it is taken from the work of a native artist. The Persian inscription at the bottom of the picture has suffered at the hands of the English engraver, and is consequently difficult to read; but Professor Denison Ross renders it as: 'In the year [illegible], in the town of B\u00e1ndh\u00fa, I, the writer of this, Minuchehr (?), was fifty years of age.'\"\n\nIt is not my intention to criticize this rendering, taking the Persian text as it stands. I am tempted, however, to\nhazard a conjecture that the inscription might be amended so as to allow of a translation as follows: \"The year 1026, in the city M\u00e1nd\u00fa, I am the writer; also I was in the fiftieth year of my age.\" The matter is not without importance, because if my conjecture be accurate there can be little doubt that the writing is an autograph of the Emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr himself.\n\nIt may be well, therefore, to adduce reasons for the translation which I have suggested. Obviously, as Professor Denison Ross points out, the date as it stands is illegible. The first figure, which is 1, is clear, and may be dismissed without criticism. Then comes, I fancy, a hiatus. In this direction two conjectures may be made: (1) That a dot has accidentally disappeared; or (2) that the mark which was originally a dot has at some time or another, owing either to carelessness or ignorance on the part of a copyist or engraver, been written as a dash, and as such has been joined to the upright stroke of the figure on its right. I am tempted to choose the latter alternative, as otherwise there is no *raison d'\u00eatre* for a dash at all; and it simplifies matters materially if this unmeaning surplusage be eliminated. On this supposition the hiatus should be rectified by the insertion of a dot, equivalent in English to a 0, and the first two figures would then be (in English) 10.\n\nAs regards the third figure, since the mark drawn towards the left of the upright stroke has been expunged, there remains a distinct 2. These surmises point to the probability that the first three figures are 102. The last figure presents but little difficulty, it being manifestly intended for a 6. The date is therefore 1026, of course of the Muhammadan Hijrah era, equivalent to A.D. 1617, at which time Roe was at the Court of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr.\n\nInstead of B\u00e1ndh\u00fa I should read M\u00e1nd\u00fa; because (a) there is no h in the original text, and (b) less modification of the first letter would be required to turn it into m than to make it b. In the former case it is merely necessary to make the stroke at the base more bulbous, whereas Professor Ross' rendering necessitates the addition of a diacritical point.\nThe next word on the list is evidently intended for *r\u00e1qim*, 'writer,' the tail of the concluding letter *m* being accidentally written in an horizontal instead of an upright position.\n\nThe next three letters Professor Ross joins on to the following two, and renders the whole as 'Minuchehr.' This version appears to be so hopelessly obscure that I am tempted to suggest with the fullest confidence that the reading should be not one word but two, of which the first is *man-am* (a compound word), the equivalent in English being 'I am.' The sentence thus far would, therefore, read: \"The year 1026, in the city M\u00e1nd\u00fa, I am the writer.\"\n\nThe remainder of the inscription is comparatively easy. The two letters supposed by Professor Ross to be equivalent to *chehr* are without doubt merely the word *ham* (= 'also'); if, therefore, as regards the remaining words in the inscription, the necessary dots be supplied\u2014and there is no room for doubt on the subject\u2014the rest of the translation would read: \"also I was in the fiftieth year of my age.\"\n\nThus much as regards the writing from a purely scholarly point of view; but there are other considerations which tend to confirm the surmise that the rendering now given is likely to be accurate. In the first place, an inscription of this kind must either be (a) the artist's signature of his work; (b) a description of the person portrayed; or (c) an addition made by some person in presenting the portrait to someone else. As regards supposition (a), if, taking Professor Ross' translation, a person named 'Minuchehr' painted the picture, it might fairly be supposed that some allusion would be made to him in Roe's Journal, or elsewhere; but such is not the case so far as I am aware. Again, the handwriting is of the schoolboy type, and in the very improbable circumstances that the Court painter would venture to write anything on a picture of an Emperor whose very nod was death, it is pretty certain that he would have employed a *Khush-Nivis* (professional writer) to pen the words in the most approved fashion, and in all probability would have contented himself with adding thereto his own personal signature or seal. Supposition\nThe Autograph of the Emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr.\n\nIn any case out of the question. But if be adopted, and it be conceded that the autograph of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, the difficulties disappear. Such a scrawl is just what might have been part of a great monarch, whose handwriting not of the most elegant description. Still is the fact that the two dates given in the would apply accurately to the Emperor. Having 17 Rabi-ul-Aval, A.H. 977, His Majesty's year would run from his birthday in A.H. 1026 to 13th March, A.D. 1618. Further, the Emperor M\u00e1nd\u00fa from 3rd March to 24th October, 1617 (see Roe's Journal, pp. 391 and 437), a period which embraces months of his fiftieth year.\n\nIn the absence of any evidence on the subject, the history picture must remain a matter of hypothesis. All considered, perhaps the most probable conjecture it was presented to Roe by Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, and that at request of the former the Emperor condescended to a few words on it with his own royal hand. It is known from Roe's Journal (p. 227) that on one occasion (1st August, 1616) the monarch offered the ambassador his warrant, either for himself or for King James. Roe accepted the offer on behalf of his master, and added that \"since His Majesty had emboldened me, I would desier one for myself, which I would keepe and leaue to my posterity as an ensigne of His Majestie's favour.\" He replied: 'Your King doth not desire one, but you doe; therefore you shall have it'; and soe gave present order for the making.\" His Majesty's promise was fulfilled (on the 17th August, 1616) by the presentation of a miniature, as recorded at p. 244; that this, however, could not have been the portrait under discussion is proved not only by the dates but by the circumstance that the Emperor did not leave Agra till some months after the last-mentioned day, and could not therefore have been either at M\u00e1nd\u00fa or B\u00e1ndh\u00fa at that period. It is not unreasonable, however, to surmise\nthat another portrait may have been given to Roe in the following year, possibly at his own request, for presentation to King James. The omission on the part of the ambassador of any mention of the second gift is not surprising, since that portion of his Journal is only known in Purchas' much abbreviated version. But in any case it is not within the province of the present article to enter upon a discussion relative to this point. All that devolves upon me is to show the reasonableness of the theory which I have propounded that the writing on the picture is the autograph of the Emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr.\nART. VI.\u2014Sumerian or Cryptography. By T. G. Pinches, M.R.A.S.\n\nFifteen years ago I read before this Society a paper treating of \"the languages of the Early Inhabitants of Mesopotamia,\" in which I expressed my conviction that the non-Semitic dialects (for there are at least two closely-allied idioms) spoken in that district, revealed to us by the Babylonian and Assyrian inscriptions, were really languages, and not cryptographies or \"allographic systems of writing,\" as they were called by those who favoured the theory of the artificial nature of the script employed.\n\nAt that time, as nearly as I can recollect, there were but two Assyriologists who held the theory to which I have referred, namely, Hal\u00e9vy, who first put it forth, and Guyard, who was, I believe, one of his pupils. Later on, Fried. Delitzsch joined the band, but afterwards recanted his heresy on seeing how many difficulties attended the acceptance of the explanations offered. Of late years, however, in the increasing ranks of the Assyriologists, M. Hal\u00e9vy has found several supporters, and the time has come to turn attention to this theory that has been advanced, and which has gained in importance with those who do not know, and who naturally think that, as the hypothesis put forward has now many adherents, there is at least great probability that those who hold the older opinion are wrong.\n\nAt this point, however, I should like clearly to define the ground that I shall cover in the present paper. What I should like to do would be, to go over all the arguments that have been advanced in favour of the theory that those ancient idioms of the Mesopotamian plains were not languages, but 'allographies,' and examine dispassionately and carefully each one, quoting all the points for and\nagainst, and drawing a conclusion from an examination of the whole. This, unfortunately, I am unable to do for want of time; the examination of the many papers that have been written by M. Hal\u00e9vy alone would have bespoken my leisure hours for many weeks, and rendered the writing of this paper impossible.\n\nA few words upon the arguments advanced are necessary, however, to make the reader understand the nature of the question at issue, and this is probably best done by describing what the documents are with which students of Assyrian have to deal.\n\nThe most important of the inscriptions of Babylonia and Assyria for the language in general are the bilingual texts, which give mainly hymns to the gods, incantations, psalms of a penitential nature, etc., with a few historical texts. These inscriptions are generally interlinear, but are sometimes written in parallel columns, the non-Semitic version being always first. As in the case of the Assyrian inscriptions in general, however, these documents would of themselves be of but little value without the syllabaries, which give us the various pronunciations of the syllables of which the words and groups are composed.\n\nThese syllabaries are of various kinds. The simplest are those giving the pronunciation, the character, and the name of the character. A second class gives the pronunciation, the character, and its meaning when so pronounced in the non-Semitic idiom. A third class gives the pronunciation, the character or group, the name or names of the character or group, and the meaning in Assyrian. Yet another class gives a list of non-Semitic words pronounced (or written) in the same way when phonetically rendered, the characters by which they are expressed when ideographically written, and their meanings. In addition to these important documents bearing on the pronunciation of the non-Semitic idiom (the so-called system of rebuses), there is a large number of bilingual lists with non-Semitic (Sumerian) glosses, and at least one fragment exists of a narrative text written in three lines (not columns), giving (first) the non-Semitic words\nof the inscription, (second) the pronunciation of the words in the first line, and (third) the meaning in Assyrian.\n\nIf we take a portion of a syllabary of the first series, that with the values of the character and its name or names, we shall find that the names of the characters are formed from the values. Thus the value of the character meaning 'great' is *gal*, a syllable which, in the non-Semitic idiom, has the same meaning. By attaching to the syllable *gal* the Assyrian nominative ending *u*, and doubling the *l*, we get the form *gallu*, the name of the character, which is sometimes used (and then it is not, naturally, the name of the character) in Assyrian as a synonym of the Semitic word *rab\u00fb*, meaning 'great.' Other examples of this are *hullu*, from *hul*, 'evil'; *mahlu*, from *mal*, 'supreme'; *mad\u00fb*, from *mad\u00ea*, 'double'; *dimmu*, from *dim*, 'cord'; *\u0113nu*, from *\u0113n*, 'lord'; *tappu*, from *tab*, 'companion'; *\u0113dinu*, from *\u0113din*, 'plain' ('Eden'); *temennu*, from *temena*, 'memorial-cylinder'; *d\u00fb*, from *du*, 'seat, mound'; with many others.\n\nBesides these, however, a number of words, evidently borrowed, are common to both idioms, both Assyrian and non-Semitic. Thus we have *\u0113-gala* and *\u0113kallu*, 'great house' or 'palace'; *dup-sara* and *dup\u0161arru*, 'scribe'; *gala* and *gallu*, 'demon, devil'; *namtara* and *namtaru*, 'fate'; *sa-bara* and *saparu*, 'net'; *u\u0161bar* and *u\u0161paru*, 'loom'; *guza* and *kuss\u00fb*, 'throne'; *mada* and *matu*, 'land, country'; *harran* and *harranu*, 'road'; *abzu* and *apad\u00fb*, 'abyss'; *ibila* and *ablu*, 'son'; *duba* and *duppu*, 'tablet'; *saga* and *saku*, 'head, end' (of a piece of ground); *bala* and *pal\u00fb*, 'regnal year'; *lamma* and *lamassu*, 'colossus'; *ban\u0161ur* and *pa\u0161\u0161uru*, 'dish'; *sah* and *sahu*, 'pig'; *adamu* and *adamatu*, 'gore, blood'; *isaga* (*nisaga*) and *i\u0161\u0161aku* (*nisakku*), 'prince, chief'; *umbin* and *ubanu*, 'finger'; *nun* and *nunu*, 'fish'; *urudu* and *\u0113ru*, 'copper'; *illat* or *ellat*, 'army'; *urugala*, *arali*, and\n\n---\n\n1 It is to be noted that this is only in compound words, borrowed from Sumerian. Thus \u1d48\u2083\u2084 \u1d48\u2083\u2084, *gallum*, quoted by Br\u00fcnnow (6842), is in reality the second part of the word \u1d48\u2083\u2084 \u1d48\u2083\u2084 \u1d48\u2083\u2084 *gungallum*, 'great bull,' from the Sum. \u1d48\u2083\u2084 \u1d48\u2083\u2084 *gugalu*.\narallu, 'hadee'; saangu and sangu, 'priest' (both from sag, 'head!'); sukkal and sukkalu, 'messenger'; agarin and agarinnu, 'mother'; kisal and kisallu, 'platform'; u\u0161umgal and u\u0161umgallu, 'peerless one, demon'; bara and parakku, 'shrine'; silim and salimu or \u0161ulmu, 'peace'; n\u00e9r, the neros (600); damgar and tankaru, 'agent'; ingar and igaru, 'enclosure'; gidim and edimmu, utug and utukku, names of evil spirits; eg\u00e1 and ag\u00e1, 'inundation,' with many others.\n\nSome of my readers will probably have recognized, in this list of similar words in the two idioms, a few roots that are common Semitic property. \u00c9kallu is, of course, the common word h\u0113kal, 'temple'; dup\u0161arru is the Hebrew \u0161ip\u0161ar, used in Jeremiah and Nahum for 'governor'; kuss\u016b is the well-known word for 'throne,' in Heb. kiss\u0113 and in Arabic kur\u0161i; nunu, 'fish'; silim, \u0161ulmu, and salimu, 'peace'; and others which are not so easy to identify on account of the transformations they have undergone, but whose derivations have been worked out, and are known, may also be noted. Among these are \u1e25arranu, 'road,' from \u1e25araru, 'to make a furrow'; ibila and \u0101blu, 'son,' from \u0101blu, 'to produce'; adama and adamatu, 'blood' or 'gore,' from the same root as Adam, Edom, etc.; illat or ellat, 'army,' the Heb. heyil or h\u0113l, 'army, fortification,' whilst damgar and tankaru, 'agent,' are connected with the word makkuru, 'property.'\n\nWhen two nationalities come together, or have close communications with each other, it is the usual thing for an interchange of words to take place, for it is certain that they will both possess expressions or meanings of synonymous words wanting to one or the other, and this being the case, they will be under the necessity of borrowing unless the needful synonym can be coined easily. This, however, seldom happens, and they borrow, often (as in the case of our own language) when there is little or no need for it, for after a time words become commonplace, 'worn out,' so to say, and foreign words take their place even though good words expressing the same ideas already exist. This is the true explanation of the fact that the\nSemitic and non-Semitic idioms of ancient Mesopotamia have so much in common.\n\nThe anti-Akkadists, or those who contend that there is no non-Semitic idiom, but only a kind of cryptography, which they call 'allography,' or 'hieroglyphic system' of writing, make use of the above-mentioned facts to support their theory. Their method is well seen in Hal\u00e9vy's *Aper\u00e7u Grammatical de l'allographie Assyro-Babylonienne* (Leyden Orientalist Congress, 1884). Thus, on p. 10 of the *Aper\u00e7u Grammatical*, the names of the characters of the syllabary giving the phonetic values, the characters, and their names, are taken, and treated as if they were words actually used by the ancient Babylonian scribes. Beginning with the word *gal*, 'great,' the author sets beside it what he calls the 'type d\u00e9m.' (which is apparently an abbreviation of the words 'type d\u00e9motique') *gallu*, with the word 'idem' to indicate that it has the same meaning as the Akkadian word, instead of this being the name of the character. A whole row of Akkadian roots are treated in the same way, thus:\n\n| Akkadian Root | Demotic Type |\n|---------------|--------------|\n| *bur*, to dissolve | *burru* |\n| *iz*, wood | *tsu* |\n| *gi\u0161*, wood | *gi\u0161\u0161u*, *ga\u0161\u0161u*, wood, perch. |\n| *el*, pure | *ellu* |\n| *zub*, to melt | *zub* |\n| *nag*, to pour out, to drink | *naqu* |\n| *mah*, great, superior | *mah\u1e2bu* |\n| *gir*, dagger, sword | *giru* |\n| *gir*, foot | *girru*, expedition. |\n| *tab*, companion | *tabbu* |\n| *sal*, slave, woman | *salatu* |\n| *kar*, enclosure, city | *karu* |\n| *ab*, deep valley | *apu*, cavity. |\n\netc., etc.\n\n1 It is to be noted that *iz* is regarded by Assyriologists as a Semitic value, not taken from the Sumerian, but from the common Semitic word *\u0163pu* or *\u0163pu*, 'wood.' The Sum. word is given in the next line.\nBut *bur*, \u2018to dissolve,\u2019 is practically an unknown root as a verb in Assyrian, as is also *zub*, \u2018to melt.\u2019 For the purposes of his comparison, too, the ingenious anti-Akkadiast ignores the long *u* of *nag\u016b*, and the fact that, in Assyrian, this purely Semitic root does not mean \u2018to drink,\u2019 but only \u2018to pour out, as a libation,\u2019 and that the purely Akkadian *nag* does not mean \u2018to pour out,\u2019 but only \u2018to drink.\u2019 *Mahlu*, \u2018supreme,\u2019 generally appears (like *gallu*, \u2018great\u2019) in compounds, and is then used as a word borrowed from the Sumerian, in which language compounds were common, whilst they were exceedingly rare in Assyrian. *Giru*, \u2018dagger,\u2019 is not used in Assyrian, that word being replaced by the purely Semitic *patru*, whilst as to *girru*, \u2018expedition,\u2019 that also is Semitic, the word for \u2018foot\u2019 in Sumerian never being used for it. Then, again, if *salatu* have anything to do with *sul*, this must be entirely as a borrowed word, to which the feminine ending -*tu* has been added. With regard to the last two words I have quoted, *karu* is apparently borrowed from the Sumerian, and *apu* may be regarded as being in the same case, though the word in the one case and the meaning in both are probably not altogether correctly stated.\n\nLet us take one of the above-quoted words, and examine it in the light of the inscriptions. Say *giru*, \u2018dagger,\u2019 for instance.\n\nIn the first place, it is to be noted that Br\u00fcnnow does not quote *giru* in his \u201cClassified List\u201d as being used in Assyrian with any of the meanings of this Sumerian word.\n\nFuller, however, than Br\u00fcnnow\u2019s most valuable work, is the British Museum syllabary 80\u201311\u201312, 11, which gives us the following instructive list of meanings of the root in question:\n\n| Gir | patrum, naglabu, par\u0101du, magzazu, gallotum, nam\u0161aru, padanu, urhu, harranu, esintu, 'amtum, sakbanni (?) \u0161ummudu, ahuru, \u0161ibbi, zugakipni, |\n|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Dagger, knife (razor). | to flee, shearing. separation (?), sword. path, road. high-road, division. ? ? to cut off (or sim.), ? girdle, scorpion. |\nAra \\( \\rightarrow \\) patrum,\\(^1\\) li\u0161an sinni\u0161ti, Dagger, (in the) women's tongue.\n\nThe writer of this very full syllabary, therefore, gives no hint of the existence of an Assyrian word giru, meaning 'dagger' or 'sword,' nor does it seem to occur with any of the meanings that I have quoted above.\n\nLet us take the root nag, 'to drink,' that being one of the words compared by Hal\u00e9vy. In this instance we will do best if we go to Br\u00fcnnow, who puts together all the places where the word occurs.\n\nThe character expressing the sound of nag (nak, naq) is \\( \\rightarrow \\), and besides these values, we find that it was also pronounced gu and immeli, and that it has a very doubtful value, lan, attributed to it. Turning to Br\u00fcnnow's list, we see that the usual word for 'to drink' in Assyrian is \u0161at\u016b (the common Semitic root), but the syllabaries and bilingual inscriptions do not indicate any Akkadian pronunciation for the character when used with this meaning. We cannot, therefore, tell from the quotations given, whether nag be the word for 'to drink' in Sumerian or not. The same is the case with regard to \u0161ag\u016b, 'to give to drink,' which meaning the character also has.\n\nOn looking further at the list of meanings, we find that it is also translated by the Semitic l\u0101\u0161u, having a meaning certainly akin to that of 'to drink.' To all appearance, some such rendering as 'to take in small quantities,' 'to sup,' 'to sip,' is the meaning of this word (see Br\u00fcnnow). If this be the case, the character \\( \\rightarrow \\), with the meaning of 'to drink,' certainly has the same pronunciation as when it is translated in Assyrian by l\u0101\u0161u, namely, gu, and this hypothesis is confirmed by the phrases containing \\( \\rightarrow \\) with the meaning of \u0161at\u016b, for the terminations attached to the word are those that one would expect to find used with a root ending in a vowel. To all appearance, therefore,\n\n\\(^1\\) The word seems really to be pat-ri, but a close examination suggests that the character re\u0161u is written over ri, correcting the word to patrum.\n\nZ.B.A.S. 1900.\nthe Sumerian for 'to drink' is not nag, but gu. A Semitic Babylonian word le'u, cited by Br\u00fcnnow, seems to be doubtful as to the meaning given to it. Immeli, one of the Sumerian values of the character that are certain, is translated by sikru, 'intoxicating drink.'\n\nThough the word nag does not seem to occur in the inscriptions, it is nevertheless certain that it did exist, and that in connection with drink, or with drinking. This is shown by the compound a-nag, Semiticized anaqgu, a kind of vase for holding liquor, of which a larger form existed called a-nag-maha, Semiticized anagmabhyu. Its real meaning, however, is doubtful.\n\nIt will thus be seen that nothing certain is known with regard to the meaning of the 'allographic' root nag, and that its identity with naq\u00fb, 'to pour out a libation,' is at least very improbable.\n\nBut the proof, if proof be needed, that what is regarded by all clear-headed Assyriologists as a language is really so, is to be found in the fact that this so-called 'allography' has a dialect! Hal\u00e9vy's opinion that the dialectic differences are really due to variant writings will not for a moment hold water. That m, n, and b should be written as variants for y; l for n; s for \u015d and d; r for l; and the vowels should be changed, all according to fixed rules, is to the mind of most Assyriologists incomprehensible.\n\nThe nature of these so-called variant spellings (diversit\u00e9s d'orthographe) will be easily understood from the text that I am about to describe.\u00b9 We have first the character \ud808\udc97, meaning 'to go,' \u0161\u0101ku, and 'to bring,' tab\u0101lu, its dialectic forms being ir and ga, the first seemingly for ara and the other for du.\u00b2 An example of another root du (written with the character \ud808\udc97), changed into ga, occurs in line 16. After this comes the root du, short for duga, with its dialectic form \u0161ib (d becoming \u015d, and g changing to b). Another change, that of mar instead of gar, is shown in line 25.\n\n\u00b9 W.A.I., v, pl. 10. This text has been treated very fully by Haupt and other scholars.\n\u00b2 Lines 1\u20137.\nAfter the break, the end of the column shows aga for ig, 'that which, what,' and also mal for gal, indicating the change from g to m shown in gar and mar. The second column continues the examples of the change from ig to aga, followed by the prefix denoting an abstract noun (lines 8 ff.), which here really seems rather to be indicated in the dialect by diversit\u00e9 d'orthographe than by any real difference in the pronunciation. The next paragraph (lines 15\u201319) has examples of the weakening of \u1e2bi\u0161, gi\u0161, to \u1e63u\u0161, mu (g to m, and loss of the final \u1e63).\n\nFurther changes are shown in the next column similar to those already illustrated\u2014ad\u00eda, for adia, for agarra, showing change of g to d, and loss of the r. Then we have a-gaga, changed dialectically into a-mama, and a-duga, into a-sibba. adar, for agar; aba, for aga; aber, for aner; and ir-bangin, for ir-bandu, follow this. The next line, the first of a fresh paragraph, has sim, again as dialectic form of dim, 'to make'; mama, for gaga; and mal, for gal. The last line of the next paragraph shows a new root, garza, 'command,' in Assyrian par\u0161u.\n\nThe first line of the next paragraph has ad-mar, as dialectic form of ad-gal, translated by tudu, perhaps the word for 'path.' The other words of the paragraph show the root mar, for gar. With regard to the two paragraphs which follow, these are principally occupied with the root meri, in its various meanings of 'angry,' 'the wind,' 'dagger,' etc.\n\n1 See p. 80.\nSome of the words are compounds, namely, \\( \\text{girgira} \\), dial. \\( \\text{mermer} \\), 'storm'; \\( \\text{girsig} \\), dial. \\( \\text{mersig} \\), a word of doubtful meaning, rendered by the Assyrian \\( \\text{s\u0101rbillu} \\) (? 'a garment'), \\( \\text{giri-lal} \\), dial. \\( \\text{meri-lal} \\), 'swordbearer,' followed by \\( \\text{mu-sir} \\), dial. \\( \\text{me-sir} \\), likewise, seemingly, a garment. The last line, which has a section all to itself, is \\( \\text{ingar} \\) (so the glosses given by other tablets tell us to read it), dial. \\( \\text{amar} \\), in Assyrian \\( \\text{l\u0101nu} \\), 'enclosure, wall,' from the root \\( \\text{to lodge,' apparently.} \\)\n\nOne of the most interesting arguments against the theory that the non-Semitic idiom of Babylonia is an allography or something of the sort, however, is its difference grammatically from the Semitic idiom spoken in the country. Many of the phrases that we find in the bilingual texts are, of course, straightforward enough, and present no difficulty. Take, for instance, the following:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\text{Sumerian:} & \\text{Ene} & \\text{gac} & \\text{mun\u0161in-gen} \\\\\n\\text{Assyro-Bab.:} & \\text{B\u0113lum} & \\text{y\u0101ti} & \\text{i\u0161puranni}^1 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\"The lord, as for me, he sent to me.\"\n\nHere the word-order is the same in both the non-Semitic and the Semitic idioms, but even in this case it is to be noted that the root of \\( \\text{mun\u0161ingen} \\) is \\( \\text{gen} \\), and that the rest of the word consists wholly of particles added to the root to make the meaning more precise, and repeating, practically, the pronouns. Thus the first component, \\( \\text{mun} \\), means 'me,' \\( \\text{i\u0161} \\) means 'to,' and \\( \\text{in} \\) means 'he,' the full signification of the verb being 'me to be sent,' whilst the Semitic Babylonian verbal form with the pronoun \\( \\text{i\u0161puranni} \\), is to be analyzed \\( \\text{i\u0161pur} \\), 'he sent,' and \\( \\text{(a)nni} \\), 'me' or 'to me.' The non-Semitic idiom is, therefore, the more precise of the two, and shows, even in this simple phrase, a noteworthy departure from the Semitic idiom.\n\n\\(^1\\) W.A.I., iv, 17, 40 ff.\nBut much more striking differences than this are to be found.\n\nSo strong was the tendency in the non-Semitic idiom to throw particles to the end of a clause, that we even find them placed after the verb at the conclusion of the phrase instead of being at the beginning, as in Semitic Babylonian, where, according to the rules of grammar, they ought to be.\n\nSumerian: Kurkurra ama banda bada-\nIn the mountains wild bull mighty in it nd-\ngime.1\nlying down like.\n\nAccording to the Semitic translation, however, this is to be rendered as follows:\u2014\n\nIna \u0161add\u00e2ni kima r\u00e9mi tydi rab\u0161u, \u201cHe lies down in the mountains like a mighty wild bull,\u201d from which it may be gathered that the word gime in the non-Semitic line ought to come either after ama, \u2018wild bull,\u2019 or after banda, \u2018mighty.\u2019 In all probability this word-order is due to poetical form, especially as it is found in three successive lines, but as it is against all the rules of Assyrian grammar, and unusual even in the non-Semitic idiom, this is surely an argument against the theory that the latter is a mere invention of the Semitic population of the country.\n\nIn like manner, also, we meet with such phrases as Anna-gi, \u2018Anu of,\u2019 instead of \u2018of Anu,\u2019 the Semitic \u0161a Anu; \u0161u-azag\u00e2ni-ta, \u2018hand glorious (or pure) his in,\u2019 instead of \u2018in his glorious hands,\u2019 the Semitic ina qat\u00e2-\u0161u \u0113lleti; ana-ki-bi-da, \u2018heaven the earth with,\u2019 the Semitic \u0161am\u00e9 \u016b \u0113r\u0161itim, \u2018heaven and earth,\u2019 together with many other differences of idiom that stamp the non-Semitic dialect as originating with a people of a different race and mode of thought.2\n\nBut quite apart from the question of the probability or otherwise of the existence of a non-Semitic language in\n\n---\n\n1 W.A.I., iv, 27, 19.\n2 A learned and important paper upon the linguistic side of the question by Dr. F. H. Weisbach unfortunately came into my hands too late to make use of in the present article.\nBabylonia, is that of a distinct nationality who may have spoken that language. In other words, what evidence is there that there were other nationalities than the Semitic Babylonian on the plain of Shinar? It is an important point in the consideration of this question, and, happily, we have not far to go to find what we seek in this direction.\n\nThe document to which an Oriental scholar instinctively turns in such a case of doubt is the Book of Genesis. There, in the oft-quoted tenth chapter we find the evidence that we want. It reads thus:\n\n\"And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.\n\n\"He was a mighty hunter before the Lord: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord.\n\n\"And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.\n\n\"Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth [or, the streets of the city], and Calah,\n\n\"And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.\"\n\nIt is needless to say that, in view of the comparative modernness of the civilization of Assyria beside that of Babylonia, I prefer the rendering of the Authorized Version, \"out of that land went forth Asshur,\" rather than \"he (Nimrod) went out into Assyria,\" for it is hardly likely that Nimrod or Merodach was the founder of the great cities of Assyria as well as those of Babylonia. If this had been the case, we should in all likelihood have found reference to the fact somewhere, probably in the literature of Assyria; for if their great cities had been, like those of Babylonia, founded by Merodach, they would not have hesitated to boast of the fact. Besides this \"the land of Nimrod\" is one of the specific names of Babylonia in the old Testament.\n\nThis, however, is but remotely connected with the question in hand. The important thing in the above-quoted verses from the Book of Genesis is, that Nimrod, otherwise Merodach, who is referred to later as the representative of\nthe whole Babylonian nation, is here called a son of Cush, showing that the Hebrews at the time Genesis was written did not regard Nimrod as being of the same race as themselves. For them he was a Cushite, but the predominant race in Babylonia in later times was certainly Semitic, as their language shows.\n\nIt is only right, however, that some independent evidence of the existence of this non-Semitic race should be demanded; and, in view of the fact that inaccuracies have been attributed to the \"ethnographical table\" in Genesis, it is even necessary that evidence of a confirmatory nature should be produced, especially as there is no clear statement that the inhabitants of Babylon were Semites, for Arphaxad would not strike the reader at first glance as being practically the same as Babel, for which identification Professor Hommel has shown fairly good reasons.\n\nWhat strikes the student of this period is the fact that the racial types of the earliest monuments differ greatly from those of the later, as far as we know them. Even at a comparatively late date, the difference of type seems to have been fairly well marked, as the two well-known heads from Lagas show (Figs. 1 and 2). On the cylinder-seals of a still later period (say about 2300 B.C.) the thick-brimmed hat, which the non-Semitic head wears, is frequent, and the human figures shown are in general well-formed and slim. Of course, this was in all probability owing to the style of engraving prevalent at the time, but it may reasonably be supposed that this style of engraving is due to the fact that the earlier artists upon stone copied the forms of the people that they saw around them, and even chose what they considered the best types (Figs. 3 and 4). The slim type is less marked in the case of the slab with the musician (Fig. 5), but reappears in the exceedingly interesting bas-relief with figures of warriors, which is apparently of a much earlier date (Fig. 6). Other types of the early period are the men with the bird-like faces, such as are often met with on some of the more roughly-engraved cylinder-seals, and which appear in a less-pronounced form\nin the case of the burial-scene (Fig. 7) and in the warriors depicted on the st\u00e8le des eautours (Fig. 8), and most pronounced in the case of the personages which ornament a shallow vessel found at Tel-loh or Lagas (Fig. 9). These are probably due to the rough and ready workmanship of the earlier stone-cutters, which became crystallized into the forms depicted on these plates. These forms, in all probability, originated in the type of face exhibited by a head (which once had inlaid eyes) from a small statuette from the same place as the other examples (Fig. 10). There is just the possibility that the intermediate type between this and the head with the thick-brimmed hat is the next picture (Fig. 11), a male head from a large statuette, also from the French excavations. Though there is every possibility that, as thought by the late G. Bertin, the type with the prominent nose formed the \"ground race,\" and, therefore, the bulk of the population, it is nevertheless to be noted that the sculptor of those remote days has represented the well-known king Ur-Nina and his family in the same way (Fig. 12).\n\nThe late Terrien de Lacouperie, as many will probably remember, had an idea that the early Akkadians (Sumerians) were closely connected with the early Chinese, and he made many comparisons, both linguistic, paleographical, and historical, tending to support the theory that he then held. In this theory he was followed closely and, I believe, independently, by the Rev. C. J. Ball, who, analyzing the Sumerian language and script, succeeded in showing many similarities between them and the Chinese\u2014similarities which all unprejudiced scholars could not but regard as exceedingly striking and noteworthy. Being totally unacquainted with Chinese, I cannot myself venture to speak of Mr. Ball's comparisons, otherwise than as one knowing only one side of the question, the Sumerian side, but thus much I can say, namely, that if only a quarter of the Rev. C. J. Ball's comparisons be correct, then he has certainly made out his case.\n\nAll Assyriologists took up a neutral position on the\nsubject, awaiting developments, and this was also my position, though I was greatly struck by Mr. Ball's researches. In the meantime, however, the publication of the discoveries of M. de Sarzec came to my knowledge, and I could not help noting that one of the heads reproduced in the great French publication had a decidedly Chinese look, the eyes, though fairly large, being almond-shaped and oblique (Fig. 13). Though I recognized the importance of this little work of art, and spoke of it in various papers, I felt bound to admit that \"one swallow did not make a Spring,\" and that the artist may have sought merely to reproduce an unusual and striking type of countenance that he had by chance come across. Anyone that looks over the well-known D\u00e9couvertes en Chald\u00e9e, however, soon becomes aware that this specimen of the section of the inhabitants having oblique eyes is not an isolated one, and that a fragment of a bas-relief showing unmistakably the same peculiarity exists (Fig. 14).\n\nNow this cannot be by any means accidental, for the obliqueness of the eye is much too pronounced for that. Whether the slight obliqueness of the eye observable in the case of king Naram-Sin be due to Mongolian blood or not, is uncertain\u2014probably it is accidental, as it is certainly not more pronounced than one sees sometimes in France, and it may, therefore, be due rather to straightness of the eyebrow than to real obliqueness. It will be seen, from these two specimens of ancient Babylonian art, that there is much more than a suggestion of Mongolian blood in the ancient Sumerians, and that the researches of De Lacouperie and Ball stand a very good chance of being confirmed. Indeed, the philological comparisons made by the latter would of themselves tend to show that the cause of the anti-Akkadists is already lost.\n\nHaving seen something of what seems to be the Sumerian type, it is necessary to glance a little at that which seems to be the Semitic type. For this the most important monument is probably the cylinder-seal of Sargon of Agad\u00e9, now in the possession of M. de Clercq (Fig. 15). On this object is shown\nthe figure generally regarded as Gilgame\u0161, twice repeated, giving drink from a vase to a long-horned bull. The date of this is, according to Nabonidus, that which corresponds with the year 3800 B.C., or thereabouts. In all probability, the inscription bears witness to the Semitic type of the figure shown, for it is in the Semitic Babylonian language, and, unlike the inscriptions found in the Akkadian states, the names of the king \u0160argani (as he is called) and his scribe or secretary, Ibdni-\u0161arru, are pure Semitic,\u2014the same Babylonian language that was in use in the days of the Biblical Nebuchadnezzar. The figure with the long ringlets like a woman (Ea-bani, the friend and counsellor of the hero Gilgame\u0161, is said to have had hair like this) appears also on engraved stones evidently of later date (Fig. 16), and in these cases he is generally accompanied by a satyr-like being, half man and half bull, both of them struggling with bulls, or with a lion and a bull. The style is less florid, but it is easy to see that it is essentially the same as that of the cylinder of Sargani of Agad\u00e9. What is apparently a late modification of the same thing is exhibited by a cylinder in the British Museum, but the face being damaged, it is doubtful whether it is of the Semitic Babylonian or the Sumerian type, though as it is certainly of late date (the inscription shows that) there is every possibility that it is the former. The superiority of the work is noteworthy, and the vigorous action of the naked man, as well as of the animal figures, shows a great contrast with the similar cylinders of earlier date which have been noticed. Whilst upon the subject of the Semitic Babylonian type, we may as well follow it down as late as I am able to go in the matter of examples. The next picture (Fig. 17) is a reproduction of the well-known portrait of Hammurabi, the Amraphel of the O.T. He is dressed seemingly in Sumerian style, but it is not difficult to see, notwithstanding the weathered condition of the stone, that his face is of the Semitic type, with a short but aquiline nose, such as is generally shown on the monuments, not only of Babylonia, but of Assyria also. This\nfact leads one, naturally, to the conclusion that, although long-nosed men must have been fairly common among the nations of whom I am speaking, a short nose was considered preferable to a long one. On the cylinder-seals that have been shown, it will be remembered that deities with thick-brimmed hats appear, and this leads one to ask whether this may not be the conventional costume of the divinities at that time. If this be the case, then Amraphel was deified, as was certainly his opponent and contemporary, Rim-Sin or Rim-Aku, who is often identified with the Arioch of Genesis xiv. Coming down to a later date, we see again clearly the Semitic type in the bas-relief representing Marduk-nadin-\u00e2hi (about 1115 B.C.)\u2014(Fig. 18). At this period the Semitic type seems to have displaced the slimmer Sumerian entirely, for the average Babylonian was not only to all appearance not tall, but also a trifle thick-set, and if we may follow the indications of the Sumerian sculptures, the Sumerians were certainly not the latter. The type of the Babylonians of the time of Nabonidus is shown (though somewhat faintly) by the impressions of the cylinder-seals on the edge of a tablet dated in his second year, and elsewhere, frequently. It is evidently that of Marduk-nadin-\u00e2hi, executed in a superior style.\n\nNotwithstanding the small amount of material at my disposal, I trust that I have been able to show something of the Sumerian type from the early period when it existed side by side with the Semitic Babylonian to the time when it merged into the common racial type of the Mesopotamian plain.\n\nThe matter that we have now to decide is, Did the civilization of ancient Babylonia originate with the Semitic population, or with the Sumerian?\n\nThis also seems to be a question that must be answered in favour of the latter. In the first place, it is difficult to believe that the people with whom the cuneiform system of writing originated should not also have been first in the other arts. Is there not, also, in the very way in which the bilingual texts are written, testimony in favour of this?\nConsider for a moment the tablet (obverse and reverse) containing a list of names of the early kings of Babylonia, in two languages (which we are justified in calling Sumerian and Semitic Babylonian), written in the Assyrian character, with the Sumerian on the left and the Semitic on the right\u2014in other words, the non-Semitic idiom precedes the Semitic. All the tablets arranged in columns are written in this way, and when the translations are arranged interlinearly, the Sumerian line is above the Semitic translation of the same, except where it was written between the two halves to the Akkadian line, which was divided for that purpose\u2014an arrangement that arose out of the fact that the Semitic translations were originally of the nature of glosses, written in smaller characters, and it is noteworthy that in some cases only a portion of the text is translated. For these and other reasons it is certain that the non-Semitic text is the original one.\n\nNot only, however, is this the case, but there is hardly any doubt that all the tablets that suggest the existence of the arts and sciences are written in the same way. The texts referring to agriculture and country life have the Sumerian on the left and the Semitic translation on the right\u2014that is (as the wedge-writing reads, like our own script, from left to right), following it. So also for the laws and legal phrases, which are given in Sumerian, and which actually occur on the tablets of a legal nature during the time of the earlier Babylonian empire, as has been frequently pointed out. It is also to be noted that there is every probability that the natural history lists and those referring to special subjects (that is to say, such things as wooden objects, clothing, etc.), were written for the Sumerian, and not for the Semitic population, for whom they were translated later, and proved to be very useful adjuncts in the study of Sumerian and the literature of the non-Semitic population, which the scribes of the Semitic period found it necessary to know. This probability is confirmed by the fact that there are fragments of lists in Sumerian only, from the Royal Library at Nineveh, and a long text of this nature, of the time of the\ndynasty of Babylon or thereabouts, is preserved in the British Museum.\\footnote{It occupies four plates in part vi of \\textit{Cuneiform Texts from Babylonian Tablets} (1898).}\n\nOne has only to turn, also, to the early sculptures to see that everything, in the earliest period, has the Sumerian, or at least the non-Semitic stamp. The undoubtedly non-Semitic types that I have already shown are a sufficient proof of this, for, except rare examples, one of which I have shown, there are no instances of the occurrence of the pure Semitic type outside of the kingdom of Agad\u00e9 before the time of the first dynasty of Babylon, which began to reign about 2300 B.C. Further examples are the cylinder of the physician, Ur-Lugal-edina, which shows a deity with a long, straight, and probably rather thin beard, reminding one of the small Chinese statuettes that one sees representing a venerable old man with just such another, but more flowing hirsute appendage. The little figures of the time of Gudea representing a deity holding what has been regarded as a firestick show the same feature, though it is more noticeable in the original than in the photograph.\n\nA very interesting head is that in the possession of M. de Clercq, which must have had a similar beard, though the lower part of it is broken away. In the case of this head it is noteworthy that the eyes are slightly oblique (one more so than the other), and that he wears a wig closely resembling that which the Assyrian king Assur-na\u1e63ir-apli (885 B.C.) is represented as wearing. At this early period it was evidently the custom for the Babylonian princes and nobles to shave their heads, and they sometimes (perhaps upon ceremonial occasions) wore wigs.\n\nTo clinch the matter of the existence of non-Semitic nationalities in Babylonia in ancient times, it may here be mentioned that the Sumerian and Akkadian languages are referred to more than once on the tablets. Thus a tablet-fragment in the British Museum refers to its contents as being \"Two Sumerian incantations used\" (seemingly) \"for the\nstilling of a weeping child,\u201d\u00b9 and another tablet seems to say that \u201cthe tongue of \u0160umer was like Ak-\u201d\u00b2\u2014a tantalizingly incomplete phrase, which suggests that a comparison of Sumerian with Akkadian was intended.\u00b3 (Lower down \u201cthe tongue of the chief\u201d or \u2018prince\u2019 or \u2018leader\u2019 is referred to.) Another small fragment seems to tell us that \u201c(below was) Akkad, above (was) \u0160u(mer),\u201d\u2074 a phrase in which the restoration of \u2018below\u2019 in the first part is suggested by the presence of \u2018above\u2019 in the second part, and naturally raises the question whether the position of the two districts is here referred to. (As the fragment is very small, it is to be noted that the disposition of the adverbs may, in reality, be the reverse one, namely, \u201cAkkad is above, \u0160u(mer below),\u201d and this would, perhaps, be better according to Assyrian syntax.) Yet another reference to the Sumerian language occurs in the interesting text published in W.A.I., iv, pl. 40 (the old 47), which gives the colophon \u201cTablet 22nd, \u0160umer (eme-laha) unchanged.\u201d The tablet which follows (begins) \u201cIn the month Nisan, day 4th,\u201d but how the first part of the colophon is to be understood is uncertain, as the expression \u2018unchanged\u2019 is in the plural. It probably formed part of the first line of the series. What is interesting about this series, however, is, that the non-Semitic phrases that it contains are written in the dialect.\n\nTo sum up:\u2014\n\n(1) There are numerous tablets written in a non-Semitic dialect, with and without translation into Semitic Babylonian, and in two cases at least these non-Semitic texts are expressly designated as Sumerian.\n\n\u00b9 Tablet S. 1190 (the lines are quoted in Bezold\u2019s Catalogue, vol. iv).\n\u00b2 Tablet 81\u20137\u201327, 130.\n\u00b3 The text of the Assyrian translation reads: li\u0161an \u0160umeri tami\u0161il Ak[kadi], \u201cthe tongue of \u0160umer the likeness of (the tongue of) Ak[kad assumed].\u201d\nThe Sumerian original has the character eme, \u2018tongue,\u2019 before the break, implying that the original, when complete, read eme Ura, \u201ctongue of Akkad.\u201d\n\u2074 Tablet K. 1413 (cf. Bezold\u2019s Catalogue, vol. iii).\n(2) That Sumerian (or Akkadian) was not an allography is proved by the fact that it possessed a dialect showing clear laws of sound-change. It is to be noted also that the grammar is entirely different from that of the Semitic idiom.\n\n(3) The type of the earliest monuments is distinctly different from that of the later period, when the Semites gained the ascendency; and also different from the type exhibited by the comparatively ancient kingdom of Agad\u00e9, where, notwithstanding, non-Semitic influence must, before the time of Sargon (\u0160argani) of Agad\u00e9, have been sufficiently strong to leave at least some impress.\n\n(4) The language of the inscriptions which often accompany the type exhibited by the above-named earliest monuments is always non-Semitic, and must, as such, be regarded as the language of the people represented.\n\n(5) Not only hymns, psalms, incantations, charms, and similar literary products were written in the non-Semitic language to which I have referred, but also royal inscriptions, legal precepts, and law documents, the latter classes of texts being such as no sane person would write in any so-called 'allography.' All these classes of documents were later, when Semitic civilization became general, composed in the Semitic Babylonian language, and this fact alone ought to do away with any doubt as to the nationality of the pioneers of civilization in the Euphrates Valley.\n\n(6) The few sculptures which present more or less the type with oblique eyes confirm, as far as they go, the conclusions of De Lacouperie as to the connection of the early inhabitants with the Chinese, and the researches of the Rev. C. J. Ball with regard to the language. It must not be thought, however, that the Chinese are necessarily ancient Sumerians who emigrated from Babylonia, or that the ancient Sumerians must have emigrated into Babylonia from China. If there be, as it would seem there is, some connection between these two ancient nationalities, it must be on account of their having migrated to Babylonia and to China from a common centre, in all probability some district lying east or northeast of Babylonia and west of China. The oblique eyes of\nthe two sculptures on Plate II only imply that there was some Mongolian admixture at about the time when they were produced; whether this admixture was numerous enough and of sufficient influence to cause its language to become that of all the races contemporary with it in the Euphrates Valley will be a matter for study and research. Time alone can reveal to us further particulars as to the real state of the case, and complete the fragmentary records of these pioneers of the world's civilization.\n\nNote.\u2014In the above paper I have employed the term Sumerian instead of Akkadian almost throughout. I am by no means satisfied, however, that the word Akkadian is wrong, for the fragments quoted on p. 94 refer to it in close connection with Sumerian, that numbered 81\u20137\u201327, 130, being the most important.\n\n[Fig. 17 is here reproduced, by the kind permission of Messrs.

Rapson, M.A., M.R.A.S.\n\nWith the kind permission of the Council of the Society, I purpose from time to time to contribute a series of notes on such unpublished or noteworthy coins and seals of Ancient and Mediaeval India as come under my notice; and I shall be greatly obliged to collectors of these objects if they will submit to me at the British Museum any specimens about which they may desire information.\n\nThe object of these Notes will be partly to correct and bring up to date the account of Indian Coins, which I contributed to B\u00fchlcr's Encyclopedia of Indo-Aryan Research,\u00b9 and partly to indicate to collectors of coins in India those classes of which further specimens are required for study.\n\nComparatively few of the very numerous series of Indian coins have yet been systematically collected. The attractions of the Graeco-Indian class have apparently diverted the attention of most collectors from a study of the purely native ancient and mediaeval coinages. But there can be no doubt of the great historical importance of these latter. Their evidence, joined to that of the stone and copper-plate inscriptions, furnishes practically the only data supplied by India herself for the reconstruction of her history. The extent to which this reconstruction has already been successfully made with the aid of such apparently inadequate and unpromising materials surely leaves no doubt of the extreme importance, from the historical point of view, of the study of Indian inscriptions and coins. The old gibe that Indian dates were merely so many pins set up to be\n\n\u00b9 Grammatik der Indo-Arischen Philologie und Altertumskunde, ii. Band, 3. Heft, B. (Trubner: Strassburg, 1898.)\nbowled down again is now anything but true. The outline of Indian history is securely drawn, and many of the details are already filled in. The future progress which scholars will be able to make in this work depends principally on the amount of new material with which they are supplied by those who have opportunities of making discoveries and observations in India.\n\n**Uddehika.**\n\n1. **Obv.** Humped bull to r.; above, tree within railing represented horizontally.\n\n   **Rev.** \\( \\text{L} \\) \\( \\text{F} \\) \\( \\text{F} \\) (Udehaki).

Audehika, Auddehika) are mentioned in Var\u0101hamihira's Brhat-samhit\u0101 among the peoples who are placed in the central portion of his astrological chart\\(^1\\); but, apparently, their name has not hitherto been read on coins.\n\n\\(^1\\) xiv, 3, ed. Kern, and trans., p. 88 = J.R.A.S., 1871, p. 82.\nThe form Ud\u0113haki which occurs here is, no doubt, a tad-r\u0101ja formation denoting 'the prince of the Ud\u0113hikas,' though, in accordance with the rule of P\u0101\u1e47ini, iv, 1, 173, we should rather have expected to find Audehaki (Odehaki). Another instance of this formation is afforded by the inscriptions in Br\u0101hm\u012b and Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi characters on the silver coin of the Udumbaras, published by General Sir A. Cunningham (Coins of Ancient India, p. 67, pl. iv, 1). While we find in the Brhat-samhit\u0101 the forms Udumbara or Audumbara to denote the people or the kingdom, we have on this coin the genitive Odumbarisa (Audumbareh) standing in opposition to the king's name and his other titles, Mah\u0101d\u0113vusa r\u0101\u00f1\u014d Dharagho\u1e63asa. The same form probably occurs on the square bronze coin which follows (ib., p. 68, pl. iv, 2). We possess, unfortunately, only a drawing of this specimen, and it is, therefore, not possible to be quite certain as to the reading; but, even on the evidence of this drawing, the fourth ak\u1e63ara certainly seems to be -ri rather than -ra, as read by Cunningham. A similar distinction is, no doubt, regularly observed between the forms Mukhara and Maukhari. Thus, for example, in Mukhar\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da bh\u016bbhuj\u0101m (Fleet, Corpus Inscr. Indic., iii, p. 239) the first genitive is dependent on the second\u2014'of the lords of Mukhara (or of the Mukhara people)'; while in Bh\u016bp\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da Maukh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da (id., p. 222) the two genitives are in opposition\u2014'of the lords, the Maukharis.' It seems impossible to determine, from the two specimens in the British Museum, whether an inscription in Br\u0101hm\u012b characters, occurring on certain of the negama coins or 'guild-tokens' found in the neighbourhood of Taxila, should be read Antarotaka or Antarotahi. If the discovery of more complete specimens should prove the latter reading to be correct, we should probably be justified in regarding it as a tad-r\u0101ja formation, meaning 'the prince of Antarotaka,' and in supposing that\n\n---\n\n1 Referred to in P.W., s.v.

The most probable restoration of this inscription is Udha[k-] Suyam[ita], and the letters which are certain leave scarcely a possibility of doubt as to the reading of both name and title. The style of the Br\u0101hm\u012b characters on these coins seems to justify us in assigning to them a date at least as early as the third century before Christ. We have at present no other evidence of the existence of a king named S\u016bryamitra at this period. The king of North P\u0101\u00f1c\u0101la (\u015au\u1e45ga), who bears this name, probably belongs to a somewhat later date; perhaps to the second century B.C.\u00b9 The same name has also been read on coins of Ayodhy\u0101, possibly of the second or first century B.C.; but this may be due to a mistake. The inscription on these coins seems not to be Suya-, Saya-, or \u0100yu-mitraa, each of which readings has been suggested, but almost certainly \u0100yamitraa (i.e. \u0100ryamitrasya). The description of this coinage given in Indian Coins (pl. iv, 3), should probably be corrected accordingly; but it must be borne in mind that the letters a and su at this period are very easily confused. Much the same remarks apply to the name of one of the Hindu Princes of Mathur\u0101, as represented on his coins; it is not possible from the available specimens to be quite certain whether it is \u0100ryamitra or S\u016bryamitra.\n\nThese coins of Uddehika\u2014like some of the coins of Eran, which they resemble in other respects also\u2014are examples of an interesting stage in the art of coin-making in India. Their types, struck from single dies, are simply made up of a collection of those symbols which, at an earlier period, were impressed one at a time by different punches.\u00b2 As to the meaning of these symbols we can, at present, say\n\n\u00b9 Cunningham, C.A.I., p. 82, pl. vii, 4; Rapson, Indian Coins, \u00a7 53.\n\u00b2 Indian Coins, \u00a7 46.\npractically nothing. Some may have had a personal, others a local, and others a religious significance; but we require to know a great deal more than we do know about the history, the geography, and the religious condition of ancient India, before we can make any profitable enquiry into this subject. That the symbols placed on coins had a very real meaning we cannot doubt when we see, for instance, that on the coins of the P\u0101\u00f1c\u0101la (\u015aunga) king Bh\u0101numitra\u2014not on those of other members of this dynasty\u2014one particular symbol is deliberately and regularly defaced by the counter-mark of another. This must surely be the record of some event, at the nature of which we can only vaguely guess.\n\nThe counter-mark which occurs on the reverse of coin No. 2 is the curious symbol which occurs so frequently on coins of all kinds\u2014punch-marked, cast, and struck\u2014and which no one seems to have explained. Sometimes it stands within a railing, and, in this form, it appears counter-marked on many of the coins of Bahasatimita, (Cunn., Coins of Anc. Ind., Kosimbhi, pl. v, 13), whose P\u0101bhas\u0101 inscriptions show him to have belonged to the second or first century B.C.\n\nThe existence of the Uddehikas as a people is attested for the following periods:\u2014(1) 3rd century B.C. (probably), by the evidence of these coins; and (2) 6th century A.D., by Var\u0101hamihira.

The gloss 'near Bazana,' which is added after 'Uddehika' in Alberuni's quotation, might, perhaps, have afforded some useful information if the reading were certain; but this seems not to be the case. Probably the general similarity between the coins of Uddehika and Eran may be held to be good evidence that these two places were not far apart.\n\n**UPAGODA.**\n\n3. **Obv.

It is quoted by him as an example of the early cast coinage in which one side was left blank. It seems quite probable that this variety of the cast coinage may be earlier than that which has both an obverse and a reverse, just as the 'single-die' coins of Taxila seem to be of an earlier date than the 'double-die' coins.\\(^2\\) In any case, the art of casting coins must be very ancient in India.

B\u00fchler's opinion was that coins and seals of this kind date from at least 350 or 400 B.C., that is to say, from some time before the Maurya Dynasty.\n\nIt must remain doubtful for the present whether Upagoda is the name of a person\u2014like Upagupta, Upendra\u2014or the name of a place\u2014like Upacanga, Upajotisa. The former is, perhaps, the more probable. This coin or seal is not unlike the Patna seals with the inscription Nadaya and Agapala\u015ba. These are undoubtedly names of persons.\n\n**Seal of Nandivardha or Nandivrddha.**\n\n4. \\( \\text{L} \\) \\( \\text{P} \\) \\( \\text{I} \\) \\( \\text{E} \\) \\( \\text{A} \\) (Namdiva\u1e0dha\u015ba), Lion walking r. towards staff standing within railing and surmounted by a fish and a banner (?); above, svastika and 'Taurine' symbol; to l. of staff, symbol \\( \\text{H} \\); to r. of staff, \\( \\text{H} \\) (probably the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b compound letter \u0161pa); in exergue, a fish.\n\nMr. Robert Hammersley.\n\nAR '9; Pl. 4.\n\nThe seal, from which the impression here described and illustrated was taken, is that of a silver signet-ring. Nothing is known of its provenance; but there seems to be no reason to doubt that it is really what the style of its inscription in Br\u0101hm\u012b characters and its other features would indicate\u2014an Indian signet-ring of about 200 B.C.\n\nFortunately the evidence of numismatics, which is, generally, of all the available kinds of evidence, the best by which to determine the date of other antiquities, is very much to the point in this particular instance.\n\n---\n\n1 Cunn., id., pl. ii, 21, 22.\n2 Indische Palaeographie, p. 8.\n3 Cunn., Arch.

Reports, xv, pl. iii; v. also B\u00fchler (i.e.).\nThis seal has several characteristics in common with the square bronze coins of Pantaleon and Agathocles,\\(^1\\) two of the earliest Greek kings of India, whose date must be very near the beginning of the second century B.C., and with those coins of Taxila of similar shape and metal which seem to bear traces of Greek influence.\\(^2\\)\n\nIn the first place, the lion of the seal is not unlike the same animal as represented on the coins. Secondly, the Br\u0101hm\u012b inscriptions on the seal and on the coins of Pantaleon and Agathocles are very similar in character; and thirdly, the symbols above the lion on the seal\u2014the svastika and the 'Taurine' symbol\u2014are of common occurrence on the coins of Taxila (c. Cunningham, Coins of Anc. Ind., pl. ii, 8; iii, 2, 13, etc.). If we are right in supposing that the character to the right of the staff on the seal is the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b compound letter \u015bpa, this would be an additional point of resemblance, for Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b as well as Br\u0101hm\u012b inscriptions are found both on the coins of Agathocles and on those of Taxila.\\(^3\\) The fish, which occurs twice on the seal, is found frequently enough as a symbol on coins of Ancient India\u2014e.g., on the coins of Uddehika described above (p. 98)\u2014but no other instance of the 'staff surmounted by a fish and a banner (P)' has yet been noticed. Dr. Burgess has made the suggestion, which is well worth bearing in mind in view of future discoveries, that the Matsyas might reasonably be expected to have adopted the fish (matsya) as their emblem. In southern India the fish was, of course, the emblem of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dyas.\n\nThe inscription Nandivadh\u0101sa is, no doubt, a Prakrit equivalent of the Sanskrit Nandivardhasya or\u2014as Professor Kielhorn has suggested as an alternative\u2014Nandivardhasya. The only remarkable feature in this Prakrit form is the termination -\u015ba (instead of -sa as would be expected) = Skt.\n\n\\(^1\\) Gardner : B.M.

If one may judge from the numbers of these which have been brought from time to time to the British Museum by visitors, they would appear to be fairly common in certain parts of India. To collect them would be an interesting, and probably not an expensive, amusement; and the study of them would certainly add to our knowledge of Indian nomenclature and of Indian epigraphy, and might often be useful in adding to the testimony of coins and inscriptions. It is to be hoped that some one in India will turn his attention to this branch of antiquities.\n\nMamma is a well-known Indian name.

This resemblance is very clearly seen when this specimen is compared with the Yaudheya coin illustrated in pl. vi, 3, of Cunningham's *Coins of Anc. Ind.* The reverse type is the same in both cases, and it is struck in the same manner\u2014slightly incuse; and the form of the inscription, \u0100rjun\u0101yana (i.e. -n\u0101nam) jaya[h] is similar to that of other Yaudheya coins\u2014Yaudheyagamasya jaya[h] (*op. cit.*, pl. vi, 6\u20138).\n\nThis connection between the \u0100rjun\u0101yanas and the Yaudheyas thus indicated by the coins has long ago been inferred from other records. They are mentioned together in the Allahabad inscription of Samudragupta (c. A.D. 380), and in five passages in the *Bh\u0101t-samhit\u0101* (Var\u0101hamihira, obit 587 A.D.). The M\u0101lavas also are mentioned together with these two in the same inscription, and they are placed with them in the 'northern division' by Var\u0101hamihira. It is worthy of notice that the M\u0101lava coins have an inscription of the same character = Skt. M\u0101lava\u015b\u0101m jaya[h]. These M\u0101lava coins, which have been found literally in thousands, are still, unfortunately, not represented by a single specimen in the collection of the British Museum.\n\nMr. Vincent Smith, in his admirable account of the princes and peoples mentioned in the Allahabad inscription, places the \u0100rjun\u0101yanas in \"the region between the M\u0101lava and Yaudheya territories, or, roughly speaking, the Bharatpur and Alwar States, west of Agra and Mathur\u0101, the principal seat of the Northern Satraps.\"\n\n---\n\n1 The full inscription on these coins has not been read.

White King.\n\nThis coin, in fabric, most resembles the cast coins represented in Cunningham's Coins of Anc. Ind., pl. i, 26\u201330. Like them, and like the cast coins of India generally\u2014e.g. K\u0101da (id., pl. ii, 21), Kos\u0101mbi (id., pl. v, 7\u201310), and Upagoda (v. sup., p. 102, pl. 3)\u2014it shows the marks where it has been separated by cutting from the row of coins cast in the mould at the same time.\n\nSpecimens bearing a similar inscription are published in Cunningham's Arch. Surv. Reports, vol. x, p. 77, pl. xxiv, 16, 17; and one is described in his Coins of Anc. Ind., p. 102, but no illustration of it is given in the accompanying plate. General Cunningham read the last ak\u1e63ara as -nya, or -\u00f1a. The reading cannot be verified from his autotype plate in the Arch. Surv. Reports; and the traces remaining on the specimen now published do not justify us in restoring either of these suggested readings here.\n\nThis coin is interesting as being, apparently, the only specimen of round form belonging to Eran yet discovered. The 'Ujjain' symbol, which occurs on the obverse, above the horse, is characteristic of many of the coins of Eran (v. Cunn., op. cit., p. 100, pl. xi, 1, 6, 8, 9). It would, perhaps, be more correct to call this the 'M\u0101lava' symbol, as, according to Cunningham (l.c.), it appears \"on nearly all the coins of ancient M\u0101lwa, wherever found\u2014at Eran, Besnagar, and Ujain.\"\nHINDU PRINCES OF MATHUR\u0100 (Indian Coins, \u00a7 52).\n\nUTTAMADATTA.\n\n8.

White King. AE\u00b775; Pl. 8.\n\nAt present there are five known coins\u2014two in Mr. White King's collection and three in the British Museum\u2014of this newly-discovered member of the dynasty of Hindu Princes of Mathur\u0101, as they may conveniently be called for the present, as distinguished from the \u015aaka Satraps of Mathur\u0101 (Northern K\u1e63atrapas). The relation of these two lines to one another is at present somewhat uncertain (Indian Coins, \u00a7 52). Until more information can be obtained about them, we can do little more than classify them generally according to the locality in which their coins are found, and the character of the names which they bear.\n\nOne of the coins of Uttamadatta in the British Museum\u2014Lady Clive Bayley, 89 : 8\u20138 : 21\u2014is counter-marked on the obverse with the curious symbol which appears on the obverse of the coin, No. 12, described below, and attributed doubtfully to either the Udumbaras or to Mathur\u0101. It may be that the striker of this coin, who bears the title Mah\u0101deva, reissued some of the coins of Uttamadatta, counter-marked with his own symbol. This counter-mark may quite possibly prove to be of some chronological importance; and it will be interesting to note whether it occurs or not on any other coins of the Hindu Princes of Mathur\u0101 which may be discovered in the future.\n\nSome of these Mathur\u0101 coins are cast, some are struck, and in some cases it is not easy to determine whether a coin has been cast or struck. This uncertainty results from what seems to have been a peculiarly Indian method of stamping\nthe metal when it was almost in a molten state (Indian Coins, \u00a7 56). The coin of Uttamadatta here described seems undoubtedly to have been cast; while those of \u015ae\u1e63adatta, Nos. 9\u201311, seem as certainly to have been struck.\n\nWith the name Uttamadatta\u2014or Utamadata as it appears on the coins\u2014we may compare such forms as Utaradatta and Utaramita found in the Sanchi Stupa inscriptions (B\u00fchler, Epigraphia Indica, vol. ii, p. 386; Nos. 279, 280).\n\n\u015ae\u1e63adatta.\n\n9.

Mr. Vincent Smith at first proposed to read the name as Gosadatta; but there can be little doubt that the first ak\u1e63ara is \u015be and not go.\n\n\u00b9 Cunningham, Coins of Anc. Ind., p. 89.\n\u00b2 It is uncertain whether or not the word R\u0101j\u00f1o occupied this position on this coin.\nMoreover, there is no such word as go\u1e63a, and it is scarcely likely to be a mistake for ghosa.\\footnote{Sas, however, what is apparently an instance of the substitution of non-aspirate for aspirate\u2014extra for chakra\u2014referred to \\textit{infra}, p. 125, note 2.} The name \u015ae\u1e63adatta is, of course, derived from \u015ae\u1e63a, the serpent-lord, cf. N\u0101gadatta, etc.\n\nIt is interesting to notice on these coins the fluctuation between the two Prakrit forms, -datasa (i.e. dattasa) and -dattasa. The latter is sufficiently common, though not so frequently found on these coins as the former; cf. U\u1e63aradatena = R\u1e63abhadattena (Arch. Surv. West. Ind.: Buddhist Cave Temples, pl. lii, No. 5, line 1).\n\nEverything seems to indicate that great discoveries, both in numismatics and in epigraphy, await the future explorer of Mathur\u0101. Although the coins, whether of the \u015aaka Satraps or of the Hindu Princes, can scarcely be said to have been collected except in a casual and accidental manner\u2014the same remark, indeed, would apply to all the coinages of Ancient India except those of the Graeco-Indian Princes, the Ku\u1e63anas, the Western K\u1e63atrapas, and the Imperial Guptas\u2014yet the number of names already known is considerable; while the inscribed Lion-Capital, discovered and published by Pandit Bhagv\u0101nl\u0101l Indr\u0101ji (ed. B\u00fchler, J.R.A.S., 1894, p. 525), and the Jaina inscriptions discovered by Dr. F\u00fchrer in the Kank\u0101li Tila (published by B\u00fchler in \\textit{Epigraphia Indica}, vol. i, pp. 371, 393) are an earnest of the epigraphic treasures which may be expected.\n\nBesides Uttamadatta and \u015ae\u1e63adatta, the following names\u2014all represented by coins in the British Museum\u2014have to be added to the list of Princes of Mathur\u0101 given by Cunningham (\\textit{Coins of Ane.

Standing figure, holding in r. hand a trident and battle-axe combined.\n\nMr. L. White King. AE\u00b77; Pl. 12.\n\nAt the first glance, one is inclined to attribute this coinage \u2014of which Mr. L. White King possesses two specimens\u2014to one of the Hindu Princes of Mathur\u0101; but, on a closer examination, it will be seen that, beyond a general resemblance in fabric and epigraphy, which denotes that it is not far removed either locally or chronologically, it has little in common with that series.\n\nThe symbol, which occurs as the obverse type, is quite peculiar. It may possibly be some form of the lingam or some other religious symbol. It seems not to be found, as a type, on any other Indian coins hitherto published; but, as has been noticed above (p. 109), it is counter-marked on a coin of Uttamadatta, one of the Princes of Mathur\u0101, in the British Museum. Until further specimens are discovered, it cannot be determined whether this symbol is characteristic of a class of coins or merely of the coins of some particular ruler. In any case, the counter-mark probably denotes some connection, the nature of which we can only conjecture, between the dynasty to which these coins belong and the Hindu Princes of Mathur\u0101.\n\nThe standing figure on the reverse is quite different from that which appears in the same position on the Mathur\u0101 coins. On the latter, the figure is most probably that of a woman (perhaps the goddess Lak\u1e63mi) and it has the right hand raised. On these coins, the figure is undoubtedly that of a man holding the trident battle-axe in his right hand. This is the usual weapon of the god \u015aiva (Mah\u0101deva), who\nis probably represented here in allusion to the name or title of the prince.\n\nThe same inscription, Bh\u0101gavata-Mah\u0101devasa\u2014with the addition of R\u0101jura\u1e47a[1sa] (Br\u0101hm\u012b) and Rajar\u0101\u1e47a (Khara\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b)\u2014occurs on a coin attributed by Cunningham to the Audumbaras (Coins of Anc. Ind., p. 68, pl. iv, 5), on which the trident battle-axe also appears.\n\nThese facts, then, make it most probable that these coins should be attributed to the Audumbaras; and, if so, we may infer from considerations of the fabric of the coins and from the occurrence of the counter-mark discussed above that some sort of connection existed between the Audumbaras and the Hindu Princes of Mathur\u0101. Cunningham has already shown (Coins of Anc. Ind., p. 67) that some of the Audumbara coins are imitated from the hemidrachms of the Graeco-Indian Princes, Apollodotus and Zoilus. We have, therefore, some data\u2014not of much weight, certainly\u2014to enable us to make a tentative chronological arrangement of these series.\n\nThe title Bh\u0101gavata denotes a worshipper of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Mah\u0101deva is probably, in this case, not a name but a title. It is almost certainly a title on the two Audumbara coins published by Cunningham (Coins of Anc. Ind., p. 68, pl. iv, 1 and 5), although he regards it as a proper name in the case of the second of these. For the occurrence of Mah\u0101deva as a proper name, see the references to vol. iii of the Epigraphia Indica.\n\nDYNASTY UNCERTAIN.\n\n? Bh\u016bmidatta or Bh\u012bmadatta.\n\n13. Obv.

Type obscure.\n\nMr. L. White King. AE\u00b775; Pl. 13.\nThere is very little at present to be said about this coin, which is published and illustrated here chiefly in the hope that it may lead to the recognition of other similar specimens.\n\nThe obverse type of the elephant occurs so frequently on Indian coins that it affords a very slight clue to the identification of this particular one. Practically all that can be said of this coin is that, in fabric, it is not unlike some of the coins of the Hindu Princes of Mathur\u0101, and that the Br\u0101hm\u012b characters of its inscription seem to belong to the same period. The formation of the name, ending in -\u0101ra, is also similar. It is quite possible that, when better specimens are found which will enable us to identify the reverse type\u2014if any\u2014and to read the inscription correctly, this coin may have to be placed in that series.\n\nThe first portion of the name is quite uncertain. The first consonant seems to be bh, and the second m (or possibly v); but the vowels which accompany these consonants are altogether doubtful. The readings Bh\u016bmi- or Bhima-, suggested above, are merely conjectural. There are traces on this specimen of something above this name\u2014possibly of another line of inscription in Br\u0101hm\u012b characters, the word R\u0101j\u0101\u015b or something of the kind\u2014but it is impossible to do more than guess what these traces may represent until better specimens are available.\n\n?

AE 55; Pl. 14.\n\nNo coin of this kind seems to have been hitherto published; and almost all that can be said as to its attribution is that, in\nits general character\u2014fabric, shape, size, and epigraphy\u2014it seems to be not far removed from the coins of Vi\u015basena, one specimen of which is described below. Cunningham, probably from considerations of provenance, assigned the coins of Vi\u015basena generally to the district of Mathur\u0101 (Coins of Anc. Ind., p. 89, pl. viii, 18), and, on the assumption that this attribution is approximately correct, we may, provisionally, place the coins of (?) \u015a\u012b\u015bucandra in the same class.\n\nThe reading of the inscription suggested above is by no means certain. The second ak\u1e63ara is quite probably to be read as j\u00f1\u014d\u2014\u091c\u094d\u091e\u094b\u2014as we should have expected; but it is not easy to see how the remaining traces fit in with this restoration. The vowel of the third ak\u1e63ara is, again, quite uncertain. There is no room on the coin for a vowel-sign above the line, if such was ever intended; and the restoration \u015bi is proposed rather than \u015ba, merely because \u015bi\u015bu would seem to be a more probable form than \u015b\u0101\u015bu as the first part of a name. The remainder of the name, Cand\u0101ta (i.e. Chandatta), is, of course, equivalent to the fuller Sanskrit form Chandradatta.\n\nVi\u015basena.\n\n15. Obv.

AE 45; Pl. 15.\n\nThis type, which appears to be of no great rarity,\u00b9 has been already published, both by Cunningham (Coins of Anc. Ind., p. 89, pl. viii, 18) and by Rodgers (Cat. of Coins in the Indian Museum, part 3, pp. 32, 33), but illustrated in the former case only from a drawing, and, in the latter case, without illustration. Cunningham tacitly places the\n\n\u00b9 Smith, J.R.A.S., 1897, p. 676.\ncoins among those of Mathur\u0101, while Rodgers gives a quotation\u2014very probably from some letter or statement of General Cunningham's\u2014to the effect that \"they are found at Mathur\u0101.\" There seems to be no reason to doubt that they belong to this district generally. Future discoveries may, perhaps, enable us to assign them to some particular dynasty ruling in this neighbourhood; but, for the present, their attribution must remain somewhat vague.\n\nAs has been noticed above (p. 115), the coins of (P) \u015a\u012baucandra\u1e6da may perhaps belong to the same class, and so may other specimens in the British Museum having inscriptions too fragmentary and indistinct to be deciphered. The discovery of other rulers of the same dynasty may confidently be predicted when better specimens of this series of coins are available.\n\nThe 'symbols' under the inscription on the reverse are apparently a tree with the tr\u012b\u015b\u016bla\\(^1\\) emblem on either side. In some cases, the svastika seems to take the place of the circle and surrounding dots which form the lower portion of the tr\u012b\u015b\u016bla emblem.\n\n**N\u0100GA DYNASTY OF PADM\u0100VAT\u012a (Indian Coins, \u00a7 101).**\n\n**PRABH\u0100KARA.**\n\n16. **Obv.** Lion to l.; border of dots.\n\n**Rev.** \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0930\u093e\u091c\u093e-\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940-\u092a\u094d\u0930\u092d\u093e\u0915\u0930\u093e (Mah\u0101r\u0101ja-\u015ar\u012b-Prabh\u0101kara).\n\nMr. L.

Surv. West. Ind., *Etura Cave Temples*, p. 12. It occurs very commonly on coins, e.g., Cunn., *Coins of Anc. Ind.*, pl. iv, 14; pt. v, 1, 2, etc.\nbut it can be read with absolute certainty by comparing the eight specimens in his collection. The fabric of these coins leaves no doubt that they belong to the series attributed to the N\u0101ga Dynasty of Padm\u0101vat\u012b (Narwar), one member of which, Ganapatin\u0101ga, is mentioned in the list of princes conquered by Samudragupta (c. 350\u2013380 A.D.).\u00b9 The name Prabh\u0101kara is, of course, well known in Indian history, but it has not been hitherto found in connection with this dynasty. It appears in the nominative, and this would seem to be the most common form on the coins of this series. The genitive, however, is found on some coins of Ganapati\u2014those reading -Ganapatyu[k] (sic)\u2014some of Skandan\u0101ga, and, apparently, all those published of Devan\u0101ga (c. Cunningham, Coins of Medi\u00e6val India, pp. 23, 24). The name Naga is omitted on the coins of Prabh\u0101kara, as on those of Ganapati; but it is given to Ganapati in the Allahabad inscription of Samudragupta.\n\nFragments of several names not yet read are to be seen on coins belonging to this series. It is to be hoped that further specimens will be discovered which will enable us to decipher the names of these princes at present unknown. It has been surmised\u00b2 that, besides Ganapatin\u0101ga, others of the tributary princes mentioned in Samudragupta's inscription belonged to this family. It is extremely probable, for instance, that the N\u0101gasena, whose name occurs twice in the inscription, is identical with the 'N\u0101gasena, heir to the house of Padm\u0101vat\u012b,' mentioned in the Har\u1e63a-carita.\u00b3 Some interesting identifications may reasonably be expected from further discoveries in this series.\n\n\u00b9 Fleet, Corpus Inscrip.

AR\u00b76; Wt. 53 grs.; PL 18.\n\nThe series which, since Prinsep's time, has been conveniently, if not very scientifically, known by its native designation, Gadhiya-k\u0101 paisa, 'Donkey-money,' cannot yet be arranged with any great accuracy, whether local or chronological. Cunningham classes these coins generally with \"the Indian coins of Medi\u00e6val Age, from A.D. 600 to 1200,\" and states that they are \"found most plentifully in S.W. Rajputana, in Baroda and the neighbouring districts of Mewar, M\u0101lwa, and Gujar\u0101t\"; and, in my Indian Coins, I have contented myself with stating those general facts, and leaving the coins, together with the two other classes dealt with by Cunningham in the passage above referred to, under the heading 'unattributed.'\n\nA consideration of the fabric of the two unattributed classes of silver coins\u2014(1) the thin pieces of silver, and (2) the thick pieces of silver\u2014and of the epigraphy of the rare inscribed specimens of the latter class, will, I think, reveal some tangible chronological facts.\n\nIn the first place, the Sassanian derivation of both classes can scarcely now be doubted.\n\nGeneral Cunningham doubted this in the case of the thick pieces, which he regards as \"the direct descendants of the\n\n---\n\n1 Essays (ed. Thomas), vol. i, p. 341.\n2 Cunningham (Coins of Med. Ind., p. 47) spells the word \"Gadiya, derived from the fire-altar or throne (gad\u012b) on the reverse.\"\n3 With the other class of unattributed coins\u2014the copper series, of which specimens are shown in Cunningham's Coins of Med. Ind., pl. vi, 1-6\u2014I shall hope to deal in a subsequent article.\nhemidrachms of the Saka Satraps of Surashtra and Malwa, with the gadi, or 'throne,' in place of the original chaitya.' But we know that the coins derived from this source\u2014e.g., the Gupta silver coinage and the silver coinage of Valabhi (Indian Coins, \u00a7\u00a7 91, 98)\u2014were very different both in form and weight. Moreover, the reverse type of these thick pieces\u2014the gadi or whatever it may have been intended to represent in later times\u2014was surely derived originally from the fire-altar of the Sassanian coins; and no satisfactory reason can be given why their obverse type\u2014king's head to r.\u2014should not in like manner be copied from the same model. As will be seen, a comparison with the types as represented on the coins of the other class\u2014the thin pieces of silver of undoubtedly Sassanian origin\u2014makes this point almost absolutely certain.\n\nFurther, the two classes are not disconnected, but class (2)\u2014the thick pieces of silver\u2014is derived from class (1)\u2014the thin pieces of silver.\n\nIt would have been unnecessary to labour this point, the truth of which was long ago recognized\u2014for instance, by Dr. Codrington in his arrangement of the Cabinet of the Bengal Asiatic Society\u2014were it not for the fact that General Cunningham seems not to have regarded it as certain. This being the case, it may, perhaps, not be amiss to briefly state the facts of the case.\n\nSassanian coins were brought into India in great numbers by the H\u016bna invasions in the latter half of the fifth century A.D., and Dr. Hoernl\u00e9 has shown that some of these thin\n\n---\n\n1 Op. cit., p. 48. In the sentence following this, he says, \"Even the sun and moon symbols of the Sassanian coins are retained with the fire-altar or throne.\" Sassanian is, no doubt, a misprint for Surashtra. The \"sun and moon symbols\" occur, of course, on both the Sassanian and the Surashtra coinages.\n\n2 General Cunningham seems to admit this (op. cit., p. 47) in the passage quoted above.\n\n3 Bhugv\u0101n\u012blal Indr\u0101j\u012b, Journ. of the Bombay Br.

Biddulph informs me that the find described by Mr. Hume took place not in M\u0101rw\u0101r, but in M\u0101hirw\u0101r (M\u0101rw\u0101r), \"the small mountainous district in the Aravalli range, forming the north-west portion of the Ajmere-M\u0101hirw\u0101r Commissionship.\" He says in a letter to me, \"The coins, of which I have eight, were found in 1889, five months before I became Commissioner of Ajmere-M\u0101hirw\u0101r.\"\npieces of silver are direct imitations of the Sassanian coins current during that period. Now, the Sassanian type of coin\u2014large, thin, flat\u2014was essentially un-Indian; and these imitations made in India gradually lose their Sassanian characteristics. They become by degrees smaller, thicker, and less flat. The process may be seen by comparing the coins illustrated by General Cunningham (Coins of Med. Ind., pl. vi), e.g., No. 13, with Nos. 14, 15, 16, and 19; and it is seen still more clearly when the comparison extends to a great number of specimens. There can be no doubt that the relative date of specimens of these classes may be determined by their fabric, and that there is no hard and fast line of demarcation between the two classes. The transition from class (1)\u2014the thin pieces of silver\u2014to class (2)\u2014the thick pieces of silver\u2014is so gradual, that it is impossible to determine accurately where one class ends and the other begins.\n\nSimilar results follow from a consideration of the process of degeneration in the types. When a series is arranged, the gradual transformation from the Sassanian types as represented in the earliest Indian imitations (e.g., No. 13 of the plate already referred to) to those of the 'Gadhiya-k\u0101 pa\u015ba' class (e.g., Nos. 7 and 10) is evident.\n\nChronologically between these extremes\u2014the date of the 'Gadhiya-k\u0101 pa\u015ba' class will be subsequently discussed\u2014comes a series, which, thanks to Dr. Hultzsch's identification of \u015ar\u012bmad-Adi\u015bvara with Bhojadeva of Kanauj (c. 850\u2013900 A.D.), we are able to date with some approach to accuracy. Specimens of this class are shown in the same plate of General Cunningham's Coins of Med. Ind., Nos. 16, 17, 19, 20. The fabric of these coins is also midway between the extremes, but the encroachment on the Sassanian types of an Indian element in the way of inscriptions or designs can be seen until very slight traces of the Sassanian characteristics remain, as, for example, in the coins of \u015ar\u012bmad-Adi\u015bvara, where the obverse type is purely Indian.\n\n1 Epigraphia Indica, vol. i, p. 155.\n\u2014the god Vi\u1e63\u1e47u in his Var\u0101ha or 'boar' avatar\u2014and the greater portion of the reverse is occupied by an Indian inscription, the pillar-like objects beneath this inscription being probably the only vestiges left of the Sassanian fire-altar and its attendant priests.\n\nThe only means which we possess at present of dating the 'Gadhiya-k\u0101 pais\u0101' class with any degree of accuracy is afforded by the inscribed specimens; and it is interesting to note that, in this case, the evidence of epigraphy confirms the presumption of a comparatively late date, to which we were led by general considerations of the history of fabric and type. These inscribed specimens are, unfortunately, of great rarity. Up to the present, only those bearing one name have been published. This name was read Somaladeva by Cunningham (op. cit., p. 53); but there can be no doubt that the reading of his No. 10 is \u015ar\u012b-Somaladevi (\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0938\u094b\u092e\u0932\u0926\u0947\u0935\u093f)\u2014this reading is verified from other specimens\u2014and that of his No. 11 is almost certainly \u015ar\u012b-Somaladevi (\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0938\u094b\u092e\u0932\u0926\u0947\u0935\u093f).\n\nIt seems, therefore, that we have here the coins of a queen. Who this queen was we cannot yet determine. We can only note that we know of a queen Somalladevi, wife of Jajalladeva II, one of the Kalacuris of Mah\u0101k\u014d\u015bala (Haihayas of Ratnapura), whose Malhar inscription is dated [Cedi]-samvat, 919 = A.D. 1167\u201368. The arrangement of the inscription on these coins of Somaladevi, and the style of the N\u0101gar\u012b characters are certainly those of the known coins of the Kalacuris of Mah\u0101k\u014d\u015bala, which belong to a period extending from c. A.D. 1060 to c. A.D. 1140 (Cunn., Coins of Med. Ind., p. 76; cf. pl. vi, 10, with pl. viii, 6\u201311); but it would be rash to make this suggested identification of the Somaladevi of the coins on this evidence alone. It is important, in this connection, to ascertain whether or not coins of the 'Gadhiya-k\u0101 pais\u0101' type are ever found in Chatisgarh and Raypur districts of the Central Provinces\u2014the site of the ancient kingdom of Mah\u0101k\u014d\u015bala.\n\n1 Kh\u0101rud inscription of her son Ratnadeva III.

He identified a series of coins from the site that he believed belonged to the Gupta period. Since then, the term \"Gupta\" has been widely used to refer to the period of Indian history associated with the Gupta Empire.\n\nThe Gupta Empire was established in the early 4th century CE and lasted until the 6th century CE. It was one of the most powerful empires in ancient India, covering much of the subcontinent. The empire was characterized by its cultural achievements, including advancements in mathematics, astronomy, and literature.\n\nThe Gupta Empire was succeeded by the Harsha Empire, which lasted until the 8th century CE. The Harsha Empire was known for its military prowess and territorial expansion.\n\nIn conclusion, the term \"Gupta\" refers to the period of Indian history associated with the Gupta Empire, which was established in the early 4th century CE and lasted until the 6th century CE. The empire was characterized by its cultural achievements, including advancements in mathematics, astronomy, and literature.\nDYNASTY UNCERTAIN.\n\nVatsad\u0101man.\n\n19.

Gold coins of the period to which it must belong\u2014most probably from the seventh to the ninth century A.D.\u2014are of extreme rarity. Indeed, it is doubtful whether another example is known; for the gold coin which General Sir A. Cunningham supposed to be the solitary specimen with 'mediaeval' letters,\u00b2 and the coin of Saravarman described below (p. 124) are more probably of the ninth or tenth century.\n\nThe style of the N\u0101gar\u012b letters and the reverse type\u2014a representation of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2014alike connect this coin with those of \u015ar\u012bmad-\u0100d\u012bvar\u0101ha (Bhojadeva of Kanauj, c. 850\u2013900 A.D.)\u00b3; but it would be rash to conclude that the two classes of coins belong to the same dynasty. All that can be said with any confidence is that they were probably not widely divided by time or distance.\n\nThe inscription is, unfortunately, not fully legible, but the first part of the name \u015ar\u012b-Vatsad\u0101ma is quite certain.

The known dates of Mahendrap\u0101la are A.D. 903 and 907 (*id.*, p. 244), and the date of \u015aaravarman cannot be far removed from these.

With it we may compare the title Kop\u016bta, 'the very pure,' on a coin of the Audumbara king Viray\u0101sasa, published by Cunningham (*Coins of Anc. Ind.*, pl. iv, 14),\u00b9 and, perhaps, Mah\u0101tman 'the high-souled,' on certain coins of the Ku\u1e47\u1e0das (id., pl. v, 4).\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 The description of this coin, *id.*, p. 70, requires correction. The inscription is R\u0101j\u0101(a) Kopitasya Viray\u0101sasa. The name also should be given as Viray\u0101sasa. This compound from r\u0101ja + y\u0101sasa is, of course, quite regular.\n\n\u00b2 The reading of the inscription of this coin, *id.*, p. 72, should also be corrected. It should be Bh\u0101gavata - Caturveda - Mah\u0101tman. The form catraveda for chatraveda appears to be quite beyond doubt. But it is certainly very remarkable, and a similar loss of aspiration in a Sanskrit form is not easy to find.\n## CONTENTS.\n\n| PLATE | PAGE |\n|-------|------|\n| 1. Uddehika | 98 |\n| 2.

Keith, Boden Sanskrit Scholar and Scholar of Balliol.\n\nHaving procured three manuscripts of this work, I at first proposed to edit the text. But in going through the work for that purpose I soon found that Professor Kielhorn was right in supposing it to be too dependent on \u015a\u0101yana to deserve publication in full. Under these circumstances Professor Macdonell suggested to me that I should collect all that was of interest in the work. This I have here attempted to do.\n\nThe manuscripts at my disposal for the task were the following:\u2014(A) A copy presented by Professor Kielhorn to the University Library at G\u00f6ttingen, and containing all the eight \u0100\u1e63\u1e6dakas, was copied in 1869 from a codex of 1778 A.D.; (B) India Office Library, No. 1,649, which Professor Eggeling tells me dates probably from about 1750 A.D. It contains only \u0100\u1e63\u1e6dakas 1\u20134. The third MS., India Office Library, No. 966, dating from about 1650, consists of two parts\u2014(C) containing \u0100\u1e63\u1e6dakas 3\u20135; and (D) containing \u0100\u1e63\u1e6dakas 2, 5, 6, 7 (2 and 6 being fragmentary). All these MSS., representing the same recension of the text, are very closely related; A and B, however, frequently agree in exhibiting errors from which C or D is exempt. The only other MS. in Europe belongs to Professor Max M\u00fcller, though at least nine or ten MSS. of the work are known in India.\n\n1 The Niti-ma\u1e47\u1e0djari has already been treated of by Professor Kielhorn in the Indian Antiquary, v, 116; by Professor Petersen in his Second Report, 1883\u20134, p. 8; and in correction of this account by Professor Kielhorn in the G\u00f6ttinger Nachrichten, 1891, p. 181 sq.\n\n2 See Indian Antiquary, v, 116.\nAll our information regarding the author is derived from the writer himself. He was the son of Lak\u1e63midhara and Lak\u1e63mi. His paternal grandfather was Atri, son of Mukunda Dviveda, and belonged to the house of Mukunda, according to the introductory verse of the sixth \u0100\u015b\u1e6daka. Two of the MSS. (C and D) begin \u0100\u015b\u1e6daka 5 with a verse in which the author styles himself Mahod\u0101darbhakulajah. This family is not otherwise known, and in any case the genuineness of the verse may be suspected, as A has a quite different version. Under these circumstances little can be said for the attempt to bring the author of the N\u012bti-ma\u1e47jari into local connection with \u0100\u015bvala, the commentator on the Pr\u0101ti\u015b\u0101khya of the R\u012bg- and the White Yajur-veda. As to his exact name there is a slight divergency in the MSS. In the actual text he is named once Dy\u0101 Drivedah, once Dy\u0101 Drivedakah, and often simply Dy\u0101. On the other hand, in the concluding notices of the MS. C to \u0100\u015b\u1e6dakas 3, 4, 5, and of D to \u0100\u015b\u1e6dakas 2, 3, 6, he is styled Dy\u0101 Dvivedi. These, however, differ from the corresponding notices in A and B, and we may fairly conclude from the analogy of Mukunda Dviveda that the correct form of the name was Dy\u0101 Dviveda. To what two Vedas his family devoted itself cannot be gathered from the N\u012bti-ma\u1e47jari. Nor is there any information as to what his position in life was. It is true that the MSS. do give us some choice of epithets like yuean, sattrayajvan; but as they are not in agreement upon the matter, they evidently are not following any tradition, but are merely guessing.\n\nDy\u0101 appears to apply the title N\u012bti-ma\u1e47jari to the commentary as well as the text of his work, for the MSS. offer us not only Nitima\u1e47jaribh\u0101\u1e63ya\u1e43 but also Nitima\u1e47jary\u0101khyam bh\u0101\u1e63ya\u1e43; but he seems to have meant to distinguish the commentary from the text by the title of Ved\u0101rtha-prak\u0101\u015ba, as appears from the phrase Nitima\u1e47jaribh\u0101\u1e63ye ved\u0101rthaprak\u0101\u015be nitir\u0101khy\u0101ni vy\u0101khy\u0101t\u0101ni. He doubtless borrows the title from that of \u015a\u0101yana's commentaries on the Vedas.\n\n1 The preface to \u0100\u015b\u1e6daka 4 in A, B, C calls him Mahod\u0101darbhakulajah, and in \u0100\u015b\u1e6daka 5 C has only darbhakulajah.\nThe work consists of some 170 slokas, of which eight or nine are prefatory, distributed among eight \u0100\u015btakas. The first contains 50 verses, the second and third 16 apiece, the fourth has 22, the fifth, sixth, and eighth 19, while the seventh has but 9.\n\nThe plan of the work is simple. While the first half of each sloka contains a maxim of common-sense morality, the latter half adduces a parallel from the Rigveda. This reference is explained at length in the commentary, which, like the work itself, is the composition of Dy\u0101. In this process the commentary proceeds on fixed lines. First come a few words of explanation of the actual text, which, however, are often omitted by one or more of the MSS.; then follows the Rigvedic verse, accompanied by a legend either in prose or verse; finally, a more or less complete comment on the r\u012b. Each \u0100\u015btaka of course corresponds strictly to the like division of the Samhit\u0101, and the verses follow the order of the Vedic text. This rule causes some complications in the not unfrequent cases when the poet tries to better his statement by quoting two examples. The commentary on one of these must then be looked for later on, but always in the same \u0100\u015btaka. For example, i, 34, reads:\n\nSamrddhim s\u0101rthikim kury\u0101t \u015b\u016bpak\u0101rena satyav\u0101n\nVaimadya, J\u0101hu\u1e63aj j\u0101tam N\u0101saty\u0101no hi s\u0101rthikam.\n\nThe case of Vaimadi (Rigveda, I. 116, 1) is immediately disposed of, but J\u0101hu\u1e63a (I. 116, 20) has to wait till after v. 46.\n\nThis transparent regularity of order cannot, however, be attributed to any artistic sense on Dy\u0101's part. He simply adopted it as being the easiest way of writing. His only merit, if merit it be, is ingenuity; it is certainly surprising that he can manage to extract so many rules of conduct from the Rigveda. But the process of extraction is painful, and the resultant morality is worth so little that we may charitably hope it is not on a level with the theory\nof the author's day. If, however, Dy\u0101 adds nothing to our knowledge of ethics, he adds little more to our knowledge of mythology. As we shall see, all in the work that is his own is represented by the \u015blokas and a few words of the commentary. These facts combine to make the work a very dull one, and to render its publication quite needless, especially as a specimen of it has already been given by Professor Kielhorn in the *Indian Antiquary* (vol. v, p. 116).\n\nThe verses are written with sufficient care and correctness, but are stiff and, as was inevitable, lifeless. Dy\u0101 does not use a single rare word, though naturally his subject forces him to employ a few Vedic technical terms. Nor has he any recherch\u00e9 constructions, though he employs the aorist and the perfect more frequently than is usual in so late an author. One use, which is repeated six or seven times, and is confirmed by all the MSS. I have collated, is to write a sentence like *tam Indram iti mateda*. Such a practice, however, goes a good way in proving that the writer lived at a time when Sanskrit was merely a scholastic tradition. The attraction is indeed not very unnatural, but it seems to have been strictly avoided in classical Sanskrit. On the other hand, Dy\u0101 is usually very exact in Sandhi.\n\nA misconception as to the date of the work has perhaps attracted to it more interest than it could otherwise have claimed. The late Professor Peterson, in his notice of an Ulwar MS.\\(^1\\) of the work,\\(^2\\) stated that this codex bore the date of 1st day of the light-half of the month M\u0101gha, Samvat 1110, i.e. 1054 A.D. Had this been a possible date for the work, it would have been of great value, as giving a pre-S\u0101yana commentary on 180 verses of the Rigveda. Unhappily internal evidence proves conclusively that the manuscript is wrongly dated, and that Professor Kielhorn\\(^3\\) is correct in holding that the work is subsequent to S\u0101yana. Though Dy\u0101 usually borrows in silence, and never mentions S\u0101yana's name, he four times heads an extract from him\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) No. 4,183 in his Catalogue.\n\\(^2\\) Report for 1883\u20134, p. 8.\n\\(^3\\) *G\u00f6ttinger Nachrichten*, 1891, p. 181; *Indian Antiquary*, vol. v, p. 116.\nwith Atha Bh\u0101\u1e63ya. The passages are (1) his comment on Rigveda I. 20, 6, where he quotes the Bh\u0101\u1e63ya on I. 116, 1; (2) on Rigveda I. 53, 1; (3) on I. 116, 8; (4) on X. 28, 1. This direct proof, taken in conjunction with the fact that every comment on a Vedic verse is a direct copy from S\u0101ya\u1e47a, can leave no possible doubt as to his date being later than that of S\u0101ya\u1e47a. That 1054 A.D. could not stand, would also be proved by his references to the \u0100raucary\u0101 and the Anukrama\u1e47\u012bbh\u0101\u1e63ya, which will be noted below. Thus we have got as his earliest date the end of the fourteenth century, S\u0101ya\u1e47a having died in 1387 A.D. But we may fairly suppose that it was some time before S\u0101ya\u1e47a's commentary won such a position that an intending author should be contented with wholesale copying. Thus we may take 1450 A.D. as an upper terminus. On the other side we have no evidence save that of the probable date of our MSS. As already stated, Professor Eggeling is inclined to refer MS. D to about the middle of the seventeenth century. One or more of the Indian MSS. may be older; but with our present evidence we must be content to refer Dy\u0101 Dv\u012bveda to the period between 1450\u20131600 A.D.\n\nSo late a work can of course interest students of Sanskrit Literature and Mythology only in so far as it preserves ancient material which has not otherwise been handed down, or affords assistance in fixing the text of extant works. For the former purpose the N\u012bti-ma\u00f1jar\u012b is practically worthless. Its most considerable contribution is a variant of the difficult story of Sarany\u016b and Vivasvat, alluded to in Rigveda X. 17, 1 sq.; but even this seems merely to be a prose version of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a account, which he has quoted on Rigveda I. 116, 7, and here refers to. If this view be correct, and that it is so will, I think, be evident from a comparison of the two versions, which are given in full in Max M\u00fcller's Rigveda, vol. iv, p. 5, then all the legends quoted are directly derived from either S\u0101ya\u1e47a's commentary or the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a. The comments on the Vedic verses come,\n\n1 Cf. Burnell, Veda-Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, Pref., p. viii.\nwith but few exceptions, straight from S\u0101ya\u1e47a, quotations from whom thus form a proportion of between two-thirds and three-fourths of the whole work.\n\nIt remains for us to give a list of quotations, together with some remarks on their value for textual criticism. The verses of the Rigveda cited are the following:\u2014I. 1. 1, 6, 9; 4. 6, 7; 10. 2; 11. 5; 18. 1; 20. 4, 6; 24. 1; 30. 16; 32. 11; 33. 5; 35. 9; 45. 3; 51. 1, 13; 53. 1; 54. 6; 58. 1; 61. 15; 62. 3; 84. 13, 14; 85. 10, 11; 97. 1; 101. 8; 103. 8; 104. 6; 105. 17; 110. 4, 8; 114. 6; 115. 1; 116. 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25; 117. 6, 7, 8; 122. 5; 125. 7; 126. 6, 7; 147. 3; 158. 5, 6; 161. 6; 162. 9; 170. 1; 179. 1; 182. 3. II. 12. 1; 14. 6; 28. 9. III. 17. 4; 31. 6; 33. 1, 5, 10; 53. 4, 14. IV. 16. 10; 18. 13; 24. 9, 10; 25. 4, 7; 26. 1; 27. 1; 42. 8. V. 2. 9; 30. 15; 34. 3, 9; 61. 1, 6, 8, 17, 19; 78. 5. VI. 3. 2; 27. 4, 5, 8; 45. 31; 49. 20, 22; 52. 1; 53. 3, 5; 75. 1. VII. 1. 23; 6. 3; 11. 2; 32. 26; 33. 2; 55. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7; 72. 2; 95. 2; 103. 10; 104. 15, 16. VIII. 1. 34; 2. 19, 20; 14. 12; 18. 14; 19. 5, 6, 36, 37; 21. 18; 33. 19; 46. 12; 56. 3; 61. 11; 62. 12; 64. 2; 66. 16; 67. 5; 77. 10; 91. 7; 95. 7; 96. 13; 97. 2; 100. 12; 102. 19, 22. X. 8. 8; 10. 11, 12; 11. 3; 27. 1; 28. 1; 33. 7; 38. 5; 44. 4; 47. 1; 48. 1; 51. 8; 57. 1; 60. 12; 61. 8; 62. 1, 8; 95. 14, 15; 102. 9; 107. 8; 108. 9, 10, 11; 109. 6; 117. 6; 145. 2; 156. 1; 191. 1, 4; while V. 40. 9, VIII. 1. 6, 43. 16, IX. 85. 8, are quoted out of place. The most interesting point in this regard is the fact that MS. A substitutes a different ending for one verse (X. 102. 9: pradhane jig\u0101ya).\n\nFrom the Brhad-devat\u0101 a good many legends are borrowed, in all some 180 \u015blokas, corresponding to I. 2; III. 141\u20139, 155 sq.; IV. 1, 2, 11\u201315, 21\u20135, 41\u201350, 62\u20136, 99, 111, 126; V. 13\u201322, 32\u20135, 49\u201377, 95\u2013101, 110\u2013126, 128\u2013138; VI. 11\u201314, 28, 35\u20138, 51\u201362, 80, 100\u2013111, 163 sq.; VII. 43\u20138, 63\u201375, 86, 94\u20136, 148\u2013156, in R\u0101jendra L\u0101la Mitra's edition in the Bibliotheca Indica. The text presented by the MSS. of the N\u012bti-ma\u00f1jar\u012b is certainly superior in some points to that printed in the edition. Its absolute value will be better\nunderstood after the appearance of Professor Macdonell's critical edition, which will make use of this material.\n\nThe borrowing from S\u0101ya\u1e47a is done carelessly: alternative renderings are usually omitted; difficult grammatical remarks are left out, or merely alluded to so briefly as to be unintelligible without S\u0101ya\u1e47a's text. Many of the passages quoted at length in S\u0101ya\u1e47a are merely referred to by the first few words, or are reduced to simplicity by the easy process of omitting all that is difficult. All this renders it very hard to discover which of the three classes of MSS. distinguished by Max M\u00fcller is his guide. The evidence on the whole points to his having adopted an eclectic method, usually with unfortunate results. At any rate, in difficult passages the printed text has almost invariably a much better reading.\n\nWhen we subtract from the total of quotations in the N\u012bti-ma\u00f1jar\u012b those passages which are simply borrowed from S\u0101ya\u1e47a's commentary, we have very little left, and that little is of no importance. Y\u0101ska's name is frequently mentioned, but usually reflects the 'Niruktam' of S\u0101ya\u1e47a's Bhasya. Independent quotations are only for the meaning of a single word: \u015a\u0101kap\u016b\u1e47i is once quoted from Y\u0101ska. Of the supplementary Vedic works he cites \u015aaunaka's Riglak\u1e63ana, Vaidikalak\u1e63ana, and Anur\u0101k\u0101nukrama\u1e47i once each on Rigveda I. 1. 1. The V\u0101lakhilya Anukrama\u1e47i is also once quoted on Rigveda VIII. 56. 3. More important than these, as bearing on the date of the work, are the three quotations from the Anukramanibh\u0101\u1e63yak\u0101ra, \u015aadgurus\u012bya, who composed his work, according to the date he himself gives, in 1184. They are on Rigveda I. 24. 1, 147. 3; VIII. 1. 34. Further, the Sarv\u0101nukrama\u1e47i itself is twice independently quoted. The only work of this class, however, with which Dy\u0101 was really well acquainted, is the\n\n1 Rigveda, I. xviii. m.\n2 B\u00fchler, Indische Palaeographie, p. 82; Kielhorn, G\u00f6ttinger Nachrichten, 1891, p. 183.\n3 Cf. Macdonell's edition, pp. 84, 127, 134.\n4 Preface, i. 14, and on Rigveda I. 55. 1.\nRigridh\u0101na, which on the other hand S\u0101ya\u1e47a very seldom quotes. The passages quoted\\(^1\\) are all verifiable, with only slight variation of text, in R. Meyer's edition. The Nighantu\u1e25 is referred to on RV. I. 161. 6.\n\nThe remaining quotations may conveniently be divided into two classes, the Vedic and the Classical. Of the former very few are left when we subtract those due to S\u0101ya\u1e47a directly; some certainly, and possibly all, come from comments of S\u0101ya\u1e47a on verses not referred to in the N\u012bti-ma\u00f1jar\u012b. All references to s\u016btra\u1e43 are to \u0100\u015bval\u0101yana's \u015arauta-S\u016btra as given in S\u0101ya\u1e47a. In commenting on RV. I. 126. 6, 7, a maxim from the Karmaprad\u012bpa is quoted. The T\u0101ndya or P\u0101\u00f1cavimsa Br\u0101hma\u1e47a is thrice alluded to, for the stories of Veda IV. V. 54. 1, Trisiras (X. 8. 1), and Kusa X. 43. 5. The K\u0101sika Br\u0101hma\u1e47a is quoted as an authority for the story of R\u0101ma, the son of Rigveda X. 81\u201394 who received a curse from the Rigs, found comfort in R\u0101ma and became the epithet 'Bh\u0101rata' used in epic. The Var\u0101ha Br\u0101hma\u1e47a is referred to for the story of Var\u0101ha mentioned RV. I. 118. 12), for the story of \u1e5a\u1e63i mentioned in a discussion of RV. VI. 17. 10. We find the maxim, ap\u0101ram ap\u0101ram, in the \u0100\u015bval\u0101yana and others, in all ages d\u012bmano na sa\u1e45k\u1e63epa, generally is quoted in the \u0100\u015bval\u0101yana RV. I. 138. 6, for the story of the gods (X. 182. 9), and for the story of \u1e5a\u1e63i. The Grhya S\u016btra of \u0100\u015bval\u0101yana has its comments on RV. I. 115. 1, IV. 23. 7, which are also in \u015a\u0101ma\u1e47\u1e0da, that is, probably from \u0100\u015bval\u0101yana. From the \u015a\u0101ma\u1e47\u1e0da comes the phrase, yo rai d\u012bk\u1e63it\u0101\u1e25 \u015br\u0101vate \u015br\u0101vate \u015br\u0101vate harati. The phrase is represented by a quotation about S\u016brya, Sa\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) References: RV. I. III. 53. 1, 5, 53. 1, 14; IV. 23. 7; VIII. 21. 18;\nIndra concerning Brahma.

MEANING OF THE WORD nihilam.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014In Leyden & Erskine's translation of B\u0101bar's Memoirs (p. 28), there occurs the following passage, descriptive of Sult\u0101n Mahm\u016bd Mirz\u0101, a paternal uncle of B\u0101bar: \"In the earlier part of his life he was much devoted to falconry, and kept a number of hawks; and latterly was very fond of hunting the nihilam.\" To this one of the translators has appended a note\u2014\"I do not know what animal the nihilam is. From its name it may perhaps be the nilgau. It is said to be gavazin kohi.\"\n\nP. de Courteille (I. 54) thus renders the same passage: \"Dans les premiers temps il \u00e9tait passionn\u00e9 pour la chasse au faucon; plus tard il chassa beaucoup le behlem (esp\u00e8ce d'antilope).\"\n\nP. de Courteille used Timinski's Turki text (Kasan, 1857). Mirz\u0101 Muhammad Sh\u012br\u0101zi's Persian text (Bombay) has nihilam, and so have the B.M. MSS.\n\nThe word nihilam occurs in the Akbarn\u0101ma (Bib. Ind., I, 255), where it is said that Hum\u0101y\u016bn amused himself after illness (A.D. 1546) with shik\u0101r-i-tasq\u0101wal (\u0634\u06a9\u0627\u0631 \u062a\u0633\u0639\u0648\u0627\u0644), of which, Ab\u016b'l-fa\u017cl explains in a parenthesis, the Badakhshi equivalent is shik\u0101r-i-nihilam.\n\nThe account of the hunting and the explanation of tasq\u0101wal are taken from the Memoirs of B\u0101yuzid Biy\u0101t, who was with Hum\u0101y\u016bn in Badaksh\u0101n in 1546.\n\nAgain, Ab\u016b'l-fa\u017cl (I. 318) tells a story of Akbar's tasq\u0101wal-hunting on the skirts of the Safid-sang, and he uses the\nword in a manner which shows that it is not the name of an animal. Dogs were employed by Akbar, \"ba dast-i-har yaki az khidmatgaran-i-nazdiki, sag\u0101n-i-shik\u0101ri sipurda b\u016bdan\u0101, ki tasg\u0101wal b\u0101shand.\" Men drove the deer (ah\u016b). When the deer reached the tasg\u0101walan (ch\u016bn ah\u016b batasg\u0101walan rasid), the servants who had charge of the dogs were not at their stations, and the hunt was a failure.\n\nI have searched many dictionaries for the meaning of tasg\u0101wal and of nihilam, but without success until to-day (Aug. 2nd.), when I have found tasg\u0101wal, with variant, tashg\u0101ical, in a Turki-Persian dictionary of the Mull\u0101 Fir\u016bz Library in this city (Bombay). It is explained as a shutter-up of a road (r\u0101h-band kunanda). It would thus seem to be a sort of earth-stopper, and perhaps was applied to an obstacle placed in the path of the driven deer to turn them or to check them for the convenience of the sportsmen.\n\nThe dictionary which yielded this explanation is entered as No. 27 (p. 54) in Mr. Rehatsek's valuable catalogue of the Mull\u0101 Fir\u016bz Library and it is described by him as the work of Mirz\u0101 'Ali Bakht, whose poetical name was Azf\u0101ri, and it is consequently known as the Farhang-i-azf\u0101ri.\n\nWhat is the derivation of tasg\u0101ical I am unable to say, but it seems clear from B\u0101yazid and Ab\u016b'l-fa\u017cl that it is not an animal's name but that of a form of sport. It may correspond to the English 'driving.'\n\nHENRY BEVERIDGE.\n\nBombay, Aug. 2, 1899.\n\n2. \"Ospreys.\"\n\n102, Cheyne Walk, Chelsea,\nLondon, S.W.\n\nSaturday, Oct. 21, 1899.\n\nSir,\u2014I am much obliged to Mr. F. W. Thomas for his courteous note upon my somewhat random suggestion about the 'kutajvara.' He is only a little too modest in saying that he can throw no light upon it, because this note (in our October number, p. 906) pretty nearly settles the question.\nThe bird referred to by Sanskrit writers as 'kurara' cannot have been our modern naturalists' 'Osprey' (Pandion haliaetus), which is in all countries, and especially in India, where it rarely breeds, a shy and silent bird. The same remarks apply, though in decreasing degree, to our English Earn (Haliaeetus albicilla); and, still with diminution, to the Indian Earn (Haliaeetus leucogaster). We are left with only one common Indian sea-eagle, the Ringtailed Sea-eagle of Jerdon, \"Pallas's Fishing-eagle\" of Blanford (Haliaeetus leucoryphus), as the others are shy and scarce.\n\nThis bird is common down to the Tropic of Cancer and rather south of it, and in Upper India. Its eyrie is usually in a tree near human habitations, to the noise of which it is quite indifferent, and adds its own, in chorus even with railway and steamboat whistles, distinguishable amongst these a mile away\u2014the noisiest, probably, of all eagles.\n\nMr. Blanford gives \"Koral, Mach koral\" as two Bengali names for it; and, on the whole, I should think that any lexicographer will be pretty safe in writing \"Kur\u00e1ra, a fishing-eagle, probably originally or principally Haliaeetus leucoryphus (Pallas).\"\n\nIt may be added that the word 'osprey' is a very unsafe one. The first 'ossifraga' seems to have been the 'Lammergeyer,' \"genus aquilae quam barbatum vocant, Tusci vero ossifragum\" (Pliny, N. H., x, 111). The Tuscan augurs were ornithologists.\n\nThe name, appropriate enough to this bird, which certainly does break bones, has since passed, in the form of 'orfraie' and 'osprey' to a fish-hawk, or fishing-owl, which does not; and now, by a freak of fashion, to egrets, or rather to their feathers in milliners' shops. I take it that the lexicographers will rather ally themselves with naturalists than with the milliners; and remain, your most obedient servant,\n\nW. F. Sinclair (late I.C.S.).\n\nTo the Secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n3. A Poem from the Div\u0101n of Shams i Tabr\u012bz.\n\nSir,\u2014It is very well known that the greatest mystical poet of Persia, Jalal-al-D\u012bn R\u016bm\u012b, owes much to his predecessors San\u0101\u02bei and \u2018At\u1e6d\u0101r.\u00b9 They have been his avowed masters. In an often quoted place of his immortal Ma\u1e6dnav\u012b he recommends to the reader San\u0101\u02bei's chief work, the Had\u012b\u1e33ah, in terms of the highest praise.\u00b2\n\nWe may conjecture, says Nicholson in his excellent \"Selected Poems from the Div\u0101ni Shamisi Tabriz,\" that the first impulse in his mind towards Sufism arose from the perusal of their celebrated poems the Mantiqu\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101ir and the Hadiqa. They were always his leaders, the soul and eyes of Ta\u1e63awwuf.\u00b3 \"'At\u1e6d\u0101r was the soul itself and San\u0101\u02bei its two eyes, but we have come after both San\u0101\u02bei and 'At\u1e6d\u0101r.\" The poem where this verse occurs Nicholson has been unable to find. \"The poem from which this beyt is quoted does not occur in the Tabriz or Lakhnau editions of the Div\u0101n.\"\n\nWe have been lucky enough to discover this poem in the voluminous Lakhnau folio edition of the Kulliy\u0101t i Shamisi Tabr\u012bz, 4to, pp. 1,036 (Lakhnau, 1302).\n\nIt runs as follows:\u2014\n\n\"As lovers have we entered the tavern. Although we have come sick and as lean of stature as the new moon. The body is like a jar, and our soul in it takes the place of water. For your sake have we come in the shape of a jar from the sea. Incarnate glory are we, though we came as Disgrace. Do not think us simple, for we are like unto the sea and the fire.\n\n\"Take the light of beauty and elegance from us, for we appear like unto the sun, a source of splendours. Listen to our explanation of Truth and the secrets of poverty, because we have come in this world from the Universe of secrets.\n\n\u00b9 Browne is disposed to include in the list another mystic of great fame Nasir i Khusrav (J.R.A.S., January, 1899, p. 156).\n\u00b2 Matnav\u012b (Bul\u0101k, 1268), iii, p. 143.\n\u00b3 \"Selected Poems from the Div\u0101ni Shamisi Tabriz\" (Cambridge, 1898), p. xxxviii.\n\"Att\u0101r was the soul itself and San\u0101l its two eyes, but we have come after both San\u0101l and Att\u0101r. The men of the Path of Salvation are all but one soul and one heart. They assert it with certainty that we have come one time.\n\n\"Every one of us is full of the true God and void of himself. We have come as the heroes of the mighty, powerful Creator. If we are in our sleep unaware of the circumstances of this world. We came as vigilant warders of this trust. Our rank is higher than this, but we, fearing the envious, have come into this world veiled from the eyes of the crowd. What place has the foot and head in the regions where we belong? We have come as the mind and soul of the turning sphere. When it had become a curtain to us, the sun and the moon of the soul, running came we on the sphere of heart to offer ourselves. We are like a tall cypress on the brink of the river of love.\n\n\"We have become a thornless rose-bush in the garden of Union. May the inhabitants of the world devour thistles after camel fashion. We have the nature of the parrot; we have come hither sugar-chewing. We are like the ocean of the Euphrates to the fishes of love. We descended on the lovers as lightly as falling drops of water.\n\n\"Our bodies had become the foam on the clear waters of his sea. The waves compelled us to come hither. Make use of our dust, for it is doing verily the same benefits as water. Take it this year, and do not say that we have come a year ago. He is the drunken one doubtlessly, and from him have we got our bountfulness. He is also the cause of our coming and declaration. The lover, the love, and the beloved, all the three were but one. We have become forthwith a San\u0101l-like leader.\"\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Kulliy\u0101t i Shams i Tabriz (Lakhnau, 1302), p. 564.\n\u0645\u06cc\u200c\u062e\u0648\u0627\u0647\u06cc\u0645 \u0627\u0632

BEVERIDGE.\n\n5. The Removal of Large Images from Shrine to Shrine.\n\nCamp, Gorakhpur.\nDecember 6, 1899.\n\nSir,\u2014In my paper entitled \"\u015ar\u0101vasti\" I have argued that the inscribed statue of the Bodhisatva at \u015a\u0101het-M\u0101h\u0113t was probably moved about fifty miles from its original site, and in a postscript I have given an example of such a removal.\n\nWhen reading the late Mr. Growse's excellent \"Mathur\u0101, a District Memoir,\" I have come across two passages which prove that similar removals of images from shrine to shrine are common. These passages are as follows:\n\n\"When the temple was built by Mani R\u0101m, he enshrined in it a figure of Chandra Prabhu, the second of the Tirthanakaras; but a few years ago Seth Raghun\u0101th D\u0101s brought, from a ruined temple at Gwalior, a large marble statue of Ajit N\u0101th, which now occupies the place of honour.\"\u00b9 (p. 13, 3rd ed.)\n\n\u00b9 The italics are mine.\n\u201cThis is the most highly venerated of all the statues of Krishna. There are seven others of great repute, which also deserve mention here, as a large proportion of them came from the neighbourhood of Mathura, viz.: Nava-nita, which is also at N\u0101th-dw\u0101ra; Mathura-n\u0101th at Kota; Dv\u0101rak\u0101-n\u0101th at Kankarauli, brought from Kanauj; B\u0101l Kishan at Surat, from Mah\u0101ban; Bitthal-n\u0101th or P\u0101ndurang at Kota, from Ban\u0101ras; Madan Mohan from Brind\u0101ban; and Gokul-n\u0101th and Gokul chandram\u0101, both from Gokul. These two last were at Jaypur till a few years ago, when, in consequence of the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s dislike to all the votaries of Vishnu, they were removed to K\u0101mban in Bharat-pur territory. In all probability, before long they will be brought back to their original homes.\u201d (p. 130.)\n\nThe facts stated in these extracts should dispose finally of the argument in favour of the identity of S\u0101het-M\u0101het with \u015ar\u0101vasti, which rests on the discovery of the inscribed statue of the Bodhisatva.\n\nVINCENT A. SMITH.\nNOTICES OF BOOKS.\n\nGrammaire \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire de la Langue Persane, suivie d'un petit trait\u00e9 de Prosodie, de Dialogues, de Mod\u00e8les de Lettres, et d'un choix de Proverbes, par M. Cl. Huart, Consul de France, Secr\u00e9taire-Interpr\u00e8te du Gouvernement, Professeur \u00e0 l'\u00c9cole des Langues Orientales vivantes. pp.150. (Paris : Leroux, 1899.)\n\nNo worthier choice could have been made than that of M. Huart to fill the Chair formerly occupied in the school of living Oriental languages at Paris by that great and incomparable man M. Schefer, whose death is so deeply deplored by all students of Persian, Arabic, and Turkish, but most of all by such as enjoyed his friendship, and knew by experience his unvarying kindness and readiness to help in the most material ways all who visited Paris in pursuit of those sciences which he so worthily represented.\n\nIn spite of the arduous duties of his office, M. Huart found time even at Constantinople to contribute occasional papers of exceptional interest and value to the Journal Asiatique, most notable amongst which are, besides his periodical accounts of the principal publications of the Constantinople presses (Bibliographie ottomane), the following:\n\nNotices sur le dialecte arabe de Damas (1883); \u00c9tude biographique sur trois musiciennes arabes (1884); Les quatrains de Bab\u00e1 T\u00e1hir 'Ury\u00e1n (1885); Communication sur trois ouvrages bab\u00eds (1887); Le livre de la Cr\u00e9ation et de l'Histoire (1887); Le pr\u00e9tendu D\u00e9lri des Parsis de Yezd (1888); Notice\nd'un manuscrit Pehlevi-musulman [\u067e\u0647\u0644\u0648\u06cc \u0645\u0633\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0646] de la Biblioth\u00e8que de S. Sophie (1889); Review of the Kit\u00e1b\u00fa-l-idr\u00e1k li-lis\u00e1n\u00ed'l-atr\u00e1k (1893); Le dialecte persan de Sh\u00e9nd (1893); Review of the Kurdish-Arabic Dictionary of Yusuf P\u00e1sh\u00e1 al-Kh\u00e1lidi (1893); and La pri\u00e8re canonique musulmane: po\u00e8me didactique en langue Kurde (1895). At the Paris Oriental Congress he also communicated two interesting papers, Les Zindiqs en Droit musalman and Le Dialecte de Chitr\u00e1s dans Sa'di, in the second of which he criticizes, elucidates, and restores with great success the text of a remarkable poem in dialect ascribed to Sa'di which was published by the writer in the J.R.A.S. for 1895, pp. 795-802. His larger works include the monograph entitled Konia, la ville des derviches tourneurs; La Religion de B\u00e1b, r\u00e9formateur persan du xixe si\u00e8cle; and the first volume of Ab\u00fa Zeyd Ahmad b. Sahl al-Balkh\u00ed's Livre de la Cr\u00e9ation et de l'Histoire, publi\u00e9 et traduit d'apr\u00e8s le manuscrit de Constantinople, to the importance of which he drew attention, as has been already mentioned, in 1887.\n\nIt is, however, M. Huart's latest publication, the little Persian Grammar of which the full title stands at the head of this review, which at present chiefly claims our attention. Its nature is sufficiently indicated by that title. The grammatical portion occupies pp. 1-70; the Prosody, pp. 71-82; names of days, months, weights, measures, and moneys fill the next three pages; the Dialogues, pp. 86-117; the Epistolary Models, pp. 118-129; and the Proverbs, pp. 130-148; while a Table of Contents concludes the useful little volume, which, after a careful perusal, we have no hesitation in cordially recommending to students of the Persian language.\n\nWhile uttering this recommendation, may we be permitted to express a hope that M. Huart, now released from the exacting obligations of the consular office, will find time to continue and extend his interesting and valuable researches into the Persian dialects, a branch of study in which he has already rendered great service to Persian philology, and in which many more laurels are to be won\nthan in the comparatively well-trodden paths of the classical language. And at Paris more particularly a rich field for studies of this sort is offered by certain manuscripts in the incomparable Schefer Collection, which, it is to be hoped, will soon be acquired for the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale by the French Government, but now lies at the shop of M. Porquet on the Quai Voltaire, by whose kindness the writer was permitted to inspect it on his return from Rome last October. Most notable amongst these manuscripts, alike on account of its age (A.H. 635), its extreme rarity, and the large number of verses in dialect (\u0646\u062d\u0648\u06cc\u0627\u062a) which it contains, is that marked P. II, a very fine old copy of the Kit\u0101b\u016b Rahiti\u2019s-Sud\u016br f\u012b taq\u0101rihku-Kay-Khusrau wa \u0100l-i-Saljuq, by Najmu\u2019d-D\u012bn Ab\u016b Bakr Mu\u1e25ammad b. \u2018Al\u012b b. Sulaym\u0101n b. Mu\u1e25ammad b. Ahmad b. al-Husayn b. Himmat ar-Rawand\u012b. This volume alone would unquestionably reward with a rich booty the investigation of so competent a Persian scholar as M. Huart.\n\nE. G. B.\n\nMap of China. (Published by the China Inland Mission, London, Shanghai, Toronto, and Melbourne.)\n\nThis Map, dated in the current year, 1899, is a reproduction on an enlarged scale and with numerous additions of Dr. Bretschneider\u2019s Map of China, published in 1896. The present Map, issued by the China Inland Mission, is a beautifully got-up one, and the names of places are all printed clearly and distinctly. All who are interested in Mission work will be pleased to see the wide distribution of Missionaries, chiefly British and American, indicated by the red and blue lines under names of places, the former indicating stations of the China Inland Mission, and the blue lines indicating places at which Missionaries of other Protestant Societies are working.\n\nOn the inside of the cover we have a Table showing the Area and Population of China Proper, and a List of the Treaty Ports, with the Provinces in which they are situated.\nand the Population of each. This List, however, is not quite up to date, and the Population must be regarded as mere guesses or rough estimates.\n\nIn the transcription of Chinese names on this Map the short i or ih is written i, but this is perhaps a printer's mistake. Although it is possible, however, that Shih became Shi, how are we to explain P'u-ri for P'u-eh (or -rh), the name of a place well-known for its tea? In the List of Treaty Ports the printer has turned the new Treaty Port Sam-shui into Sam-shin. This Map seems to treat Formosa as still a part of China in so far as political divisions and names of places are concerned.\n\nT. W.\n\nNOTES AND COMMENTARIES ON CHINESE CRIMINAL LAW. By ERNEST ALABASTER, of the Inner Temple, Barrister-at-Law; and Christ's College, Cambridge, Advanced Student; Chinese Customs Service. (Luzac & Co., 1899.\n\nThe nature of the contents of this book will be understood from the full title, which is\u2014\"Notes and Commentaries on Chinese Criminal Law and cognate topics, with special relation to ruling cases, together with a brief Excursus on the Law of Property chiefly founded on the writings of the late Sir Chaloner Alabaster, K.C.M.G., etc., sometime H.B.M. Consul-General in China.\"\n\nThe Preface, which will be found a valuable introduction to the work, gives its history and a brief summary of its contents. We have next a Table of the principal decided cases cited in the book, and this is followed by an Introduction which gives, along with other matter, a clear account of the Ta-ch'ing-l\u00fc-li, or Penal Code of the present dynasty. It explains the difference between the l\u00fc and the li, the way in which new laws are made and new offences brought under existing laws.\n\nPart I has to do with the Administration of Justice Practice and Procedure. In the fourth chapter of this Par\nthe author treats of Prevention of Crime, the system of the Chinese Courts, Punishment, Commutation and Mitigation, and the Position and liabilities of officials and their employ\u00e9s.\n\nPart II is devoted to the very important and difficult subject of Relationship, including \"Artificial Relationships.\"\n\nIn Part III under the heading \"Specific Offences,\" we find the writer treats of offences against the Person, against Property, against the Peace, against Justice, against Religion, against Commerce, and of miscellaneous offences against Public Morality and Health.\n\nAfter this we have an Excursus which gives Notes and Decisions on Land tenure, on the Disposition of property mortis causa, Trusts, and Guardianship of Infants.\n\nThis is followed by three Appendices, on the Evolution of Law of Marriage, Analogy between the Chinese and other systems, and a List of works for study. There are also an Index and a List of Errata and Addenda.\n\nIn a short notice like this it is quite impossible to do justice to the great merits of this book. Its contents, whether the work of Sir Chaloner Alabaster or his nephew, are all derived from authoritative texts. Sir Chaloner was a good Chinese scholar; Mr. E. Alabaster is so also apparently, and, moreover, a student of Law; and Dr. Giles, the distinguished Professor of Chinese at Cambridge, has evidently given assistance in the composition of the treatise. Thus the Government official or private student consulting the work can quote its teachings with much confidence. From a study of this very useful and interesting work, the first of its kind, we learn the principles which underlie Chinese Law and its administration and the practical development of these principles. We also see some of the serious defects of the Chinese system judged by our European standards. But if the practice of the native Courts had agreed with the legal enactments made for their guidance, matters in China would not be in the sad condition in which they have been for some time.\n\nIt is an invidious task to point out blemishes in this treatise, which has evidently been composed with great care\nand study and a constant aim at accuracy. But one small point may be noted as susceptible of improvement. The author uses the word 'Tartar' to denote both Manchu and Mongol, and it would be better to substitute 'Manchu' where the reference is to the Manchu people or laws. There are also one or two slips which have escaped the notice of the reviser. Thus, on p. xli of the Introduction we find the word 'T'ang' instead of 'Han.' Instead of the 'Indians of Hainan (p.433) we should probably have 'aborigines.'\n\nT. W.\n\nAlt Indien, von A. Hillebrandt. 8vo. (Breslau, 1897.)\n\nUnder the title Alt Indien, Alfred Hillebrandt has republished a number of essays dealing with Indian subjects, contributed by him at various times during the last decade to different periodicals.\n\nAs a resum\u00e9 of the latest developments of Indian learning in its various departments, these sketches have a distinct value. A century of research has not fully solved all the problems connected with Brahmanism, Buddhism, and kindred phenomena; and, though our fundamental conceptions of these may remain, on the whole, unchanged they stand in need of continual modification, as theories based on wider knowledge replace those of an earlier day. The author's own researches in Vedic mythology make his remarks on the problems connected with the Rigved particularly instructive. He touches on the habitat of the Vedic Hindus and on the more recent theories concerning the date of the hymns. He passes in review the various factors which have gone to the creation of the Vedi Pantheon, and enumerates the possible influences which have to be reckoned with in dealing with the problem presented by the hymns. Not the least interesting part is his criticism of the recent works, bearing on the Veda of Professors Max M\u00fcller and Oldenberg. Between the anthropological and etymological schools of interpretation Herr Hillebrandt holds the balance even. That he has no\ngreat sympathy with either, save up to a certain point, he has shown in the preface to the second volume of his *Vedische Mythologie*, published last year.\n\nIn the chapter on *Brahmanism*, the author describes some of the religious rites and domestic customs of the Hindus, pointing out their parallels in other countries. He combats the view that the hold of this system on the Indian peoples is due to priestly tyranny and greed of gain. Brahmanism, as he shows, imposes no harsh creed on its votaries. It merely stamps its seal on existing religious rites and customs, and in this capacity for assimilation lies the explanation of its great and abiding influence.\n\nThe chapters on *Buddhism*, on King Asoka, and on the Drama, though containing little that is original, are interestingly written and give the latest information available.\n\nThe opening article, *Das heutige Indien*, is one of the most interesting in the book. It is an eminently fair criticism by a foreigner of British rule in India. For his materials the author has gone, as he tells us, to the works of Hunter, Lyall, and Crooke; and his object in writing was to combat the mistaken ideas about India prevalent among his countrymen. To the intelligent student of Indian history, there can scarcely be a more interesting problem than that of the future of India. Most of us have lost the cheerful faith of our fathers in the potency of English rule and English education to confer unbounded blessings on an alien people, professing an alien religion and governed by alien habits of thought and custom. The Aryan blood bond cannot bridge the gulf which three or four thousand years of subjection to different influences of climate, habitat, and culture have produced between the Hindu and the Saxon. It is with the full appreciation of this truth that Herr Hillebrandt sketches the difficulties which have beset the path of the British Government in India. His pages show clearly with what invincible prejudice any attempt at altering native customs has had to contend, and how even the prevention of such practices as widow-burning and\nchild-marriage has failed to effect the remedy intended. It is the intelligent student of India's past who can best judge of the difficulty of engrafting on an ancient civilization such as hers one so different in nature and aims as that of Western Europe, and we may be grateful to Herr Hillebrandt for what he has said on the subject. As he points out, India is in a transition state. What the final outcome may be is difficult to foresee. One can only point, as does the author, to the prevailing influences and more important tendencies, and draw from them conclusions which may be useful towards determining her future.\n\nC. M. Duff.\n\nThe Chronicles of Jerahmeel, or the Hebrew Bibli Historiale. Translated for the first time from an unique MS. of the Bodleian Library, by M. Gaster, Ph.D. (Oriental Translation Fund, New Series, IV.) 8vo; pp. 341, five facsimiles. (London 1899.)\n\nThe work under consideration has a literary importance far above that which it claims as a mere compilation of stories and legends. The very fact that the opinions of scholars on its composition, country, and date differ so widely, shows the widespread interest it has aroused. As there is only one single MS. of the original, the publication of this in its present form was extremely desirable, and students interested in apocryphical and agadic literature as well as folklore in general will be indebted to Dr. Gaster for having prepared the volume.\n\nThe translation is preceded by a lengthy introduction in which the enormous difficulties involved in the text are tackled. A definition of the work is by no means an easy matter. In spite of the title \"Chronicles\" which it bears it is not a historical work, the bulk of it being of legendary character. Neither is it a Midrash, because it is not a homiletic commentary on the Old Testament or any part of it, the narration flowing in a continuous stream from the creation of the world down to the destruction of the\nsecond Temple, and even including some episodes of mediaeval history. The present volume, however, ends with the history of the Maccabees.\n\nThe composition of the book gives the reader hard problems to solve. Compiled by a certain Elazar b. Asher hal Levi in the year 1325, it includes not only nearly the whole text of the Josippon, but chiefly the records made by a certain Jerahmeel b. Solomon, who was also acquainted with Josippon. The preponderance of the portion which goes under the name of Jerahmeel induced Dr. Gaster to name the whole book after him, although \"Hebrew Bible Historiale\" as the chief title would perhaps have been more appropriate.\n\nIn the course of his investigations Dr. Gaster calls attention to a Latin work of \"Antiquities\" attributed to Philo, but until recently almost entirely ignored. Strangely enough, the book proved upon close examination to be identical with the narrations of Jerahmeel. Now one would think that this ingenious discovery ought to be of great help in proving the identity and date of Jerahmeel, but as a matter of fact it makes things more complicated. Dr. Gaster is no doubt correct in his criticism of these \"Antiquities,\" which he shows to be a Latin translation from a Greek version of an originally Hebrew text, the author of which lived in Palestine very near the beginning of the Christian era. Moreover, Jerahmeel himself quotes (p. 165) \"Philo, the friend of Joseph, the son of Gorion (author of the Josippon).\" Now, although one cannot but observe\u2014and Dr. Gaster has, of course, seen it too\u2014that 'Jerahmeel' is but the Hebrew of 'Philo,' the Jerahmeel of our book cannot be identical with the Hebrew original of this Philo. In fact, Dr. Gaster, with all his clever and learned arguments, could hardly do more than place the material and all details before the reader, and leave it to him to adopt one of the many opinions already in existence on the matter. The late Dr. Perles gives the thirteenth century as Jerahmeel's date and Germany as his country. Dr. Neubeuer, in a recent article (J.Q.R., 1899, p. 367),\ndecides for Italy and the eleventh century; whilst Dr. Gaster with good reason considers him to have been a Spaniard and to have lived at an earlier date. But I believe he places too much reliance in the pure Hebrew style of the book because this is an argument for the skill of the author rather than the age in which he lived.\n\nDr. Gaster has not confined his investigations to the material offered by the work, but refers to the whole class of writings of similar character both in Hebrew and other languages. The knowledge he displays of the Jewish as well as non-Jewish literature on the subject is so extensive that it is evident that there are few, if any, other scholars who would have grappled with the work so successfully.\n\nIn the \"Chronicles\" themselves many details invite comparison with the legendary literature of the Mohammedans. From small beginnings, which can be traced back to the Qur\u2019an and some of Mohammed\u2019s contemporaries, an enormous literature of Biblical legends developed. A small but carefully selected instalment of the same was made accessible to European readers in Weil\u2019s Biblische Legenden der Muselm\u00e4nner (1845), compiled from various Arabic sources. Al-Tha\u2018\u0101libi\u2019s large work Kit\u0101b al-arais is very comprehensive, though little attention has been paid to it. Several portions of Firdausi\u2019s epos \u201cJusuf and Suleicha\u201d have been published in German translation by Baron Schechta-Wscherd in the Proceedings of the Congress of Orientalists held in Vienna in 1888 (Semitic Section p. 48 sqq.).\n\nMost akin to Jerahmeel as to matter and form is Mirkhond\u2019s Rawdhat-as-Saf\u0101, written in Persian, of which the late Professor E. Rehatschek gave an English translation (ed. F. F. Arbuthnot, Oriental Translation Fund, New Series, vol. i). The Mohammedan literature on sacred legends is, if one may so express it, second-hand. Its Jewish archetype had assumed imposing dimensions already when this was only at its commencement. Jerahmeel\u2019s \u201cChronicles\u201d give us, therefore, an excellent clue to the way in which this Mohammedan literature was evolved.\nThey not only draw upon the Apocrypha, the Talmud, and the various Midrashim, but also on the \"Chapters of Eliezer\" and a host of other works. A closer investigation of the Mohammedan branch of this literature is therefore sure to yield most interesting results. There are legendary elements even in the Qor\u0101n the origin of which it is very difficult to trace. To mention only one instance, the journey of Moses with \"his servant\" told in S\u016bra xviii (v. 59 sqq.) has hitherto defied all attempts to discover its origin. In Moslim tradition (Al Bokh\u0101r\u012b, ed. Krehl, iii, p. 276) this servant is Joshua b. N\u016bn, whilst the companion whom they meet and who advises them during their journey is Al-Khidhr (the prophet Elijah).\n\nThe form in which Jerahmeel gives the legend differs considerably. It relates the meeting of R. Joshua b. Levi, a famous Talmudical authority, with the prophet Elijah, who journeys with them through paradise and hell. Now whilst the Rabbinic legend is focussed round the person of a Rabbi (who from a collector of legendary tradition became their hero), the Moslim counterpart of the same tale clung to the Biblical Joshua, \"the servant of Moses,\" who thus becomes the chief person concerned in the legend. It must be mentioned, however, that there are great discrepancies in the single incidents of the journey in both versions.\n\nIt goes without saying that the Jews in Arabic-speaking countries have also developed a large legendary literature in Arabic. Much of this exists in print, and forms the chief sacred reading in the communities of the East and Maghreb. Although in the main borrowed and translated from Rabbinic writings, the translators allowed their own imagination free vent. There exists, e.g., an Arabic version of H\u0101m\u0101n's letter which is not identical with that reproduced by Jerahmeel. This Arabic letter, which is said to have been translated from a Syriac original, has long existed in print (see \"Semitic Studies,\" in memory of the Rev. Dr. A. Kohut, p. 249 sqq.). For 'Syriac' we have evidently to place 'Rabbinic Aramaic,' but the source whence it is borrowed is unknown.\nDr. Gaster's introduction is followed by a synopsis of the contents of the \"Chronicles,\" in which he gives much useful information as to the sources from which the compilers drew their material. It cannot but be commended that, instead of publishing the original text, he has first of all given his attention to the translation. The chief importance of works like Jerahmeel lies in the material they offer, while they hardly claim to be considered from a linguistic point of view. The purity of Jerahmeel's style is, of course, an additional attraction, but we can barely discriminate whether and how far the hand of the last compiler, Elazar, has helped to purify and polish the diction. The book certainly deserves to be well received by all interested in Bible stories.\n\nH. HIRSCHFELD.\nNOTES OF THE QUARTER.\n\n(October, November, December, 1899.)\n\nI.

C. Temple read a paper on \"Some Words not to be found in Yule's Anglo-Indian Glossary,\" of which the following is an abstract.\n\nColonel Temple said that he came across these words while editing an interesting log of a voyage round the coast of India in 1746. It was the year in which the French fleet under Labourdonna\u00efs took Madras, a circumstance which prevented the ship in question from putting in there. The log is also valuable, as it gives an account of the cyclone which destroyed Labourdonna\u00efs' fleet while lying in Madras Roads. Among the words that Colonel Temple was able to illustrate were 'herba' for tussur silk; the old landmark, 'the black pagoda,' near the famous temple of Juggurnaut in Orissa (Jagannat); 'Kettle Bottom' as a sailor's name for more than one hill on the Indian coasts.\n\nAmong words for which additional illustrations were given were 'jute,' which was supposed to have been first heard in 1795, but in the log it was used as early as 1746. The many puzzling senses in which 'monsoon' was used were also explained. The puzzling word 'chaya,' which occurs in many different forms, was shown to be a name for Indian madder, a red dye. The sense of 'batta' or 'batty' as the difference in exchange was shown to be important. 'Soacie,' as a form of 'soasy,' a cloth of mixed cotton and silk, drew from Mr. Sewell its use by the Portuguese as early as 1550, under the form 'soajes.' The new word, so far as glossaries are concerned, 'gundy-gundy,' was explained to mean baggage. Its possible history may show it to come from the Arabic 'jund,' or from some Dravidian coast-word like 'gondi,' meaning a bag for covering luggage. Colonel Temple also illustrated a number of place-names which have been much corrupted, and located in their correct positions such queer names as Carera, Chitricory, Summerwarren, Due Point, Guard-an-nogre (Godavery). He gave the old name Carepare or Caregare for Ganjam; many interesting corruptions of Juggurnaut, including 'Jno Gernact' (1669); and a list of quotations showing how 'Mesopotamia' rose out of\nMasulipatam. Lastly, he showed how 'Golgotha' had been made to stand for Calcutta, and how old names very like each other in form had stood for Calcutta and for Calcula, a place once of some trading importance lower down the Hughli. The following is a list of the words illustrated:\n\nWords not to be found in Yule.\n\n1. Bonad.\n2. Herba.\n3. Armegon.\n4. Barrebulle.\n5. Bimplepatam.\n6. Black Pagoda.\n7. Calpee.\n8. Carera.\n9.

Obituary Notice.\n\nThe Rev. John Chalmers, M.A., LL.D.\n\nThe news of the death of the Rev. Dr. Chalmers, transmitted by telegraph from Korea, gave us all a sad surprise. Dr. Chalmers was a native of Aberdeenshire, and was born in 1825. He was a graduate of the Aberdeen University, and was a student at the Cheshunt Theological College. In\n1852 he joined the London Missionary Society, and was sent to Hongkong, where he joined the late Dr. Legge in the management of the Mission Printing Press. In the Autumn of 1859 he was transferred to Canton, where he worked as a missionary until 1879. His Alma Mater had in the meantime, in 1878, conferred on him the honorary degree of LL.D. In 1897 Dr. Chalmers experienced the great sorrow of his life, the loss of his wife, who had shared all his toils and troubles for forty-five years. Soon after the occurrence of this sad event he paid a visit to this country, and on his way back to the Far East, via Canada, was shipwrecked last September in the \"Scotsman.\" He reached China, however, and went to visit his eldest son, who fills an important post in the Korean Customs Service, and it was in this son's residence at Chemulpo that he died on the 22nd November.\n\nDr. Chalmers' contributions to Chinese learning were numerous and valuable, but one cannot do more here than briefly give the names of a few. In 1868 he published a translation of the Tao-t\u00ea-Ching with the title \"Speculations on Metaphysics, Polity, and Morality of 'the old Philosopher' Lao-Tsze.\" He compiled a very useful English-Cantonese Dictionary, which last year had reached a sixth edition. He was also the author of a small work entitled \"The Origin of the Chinese,\" which is a learned and interesting work, but does not settle for ever the question of the origin of the Chinese. Another learned work by Dr. Chalmers is entitled \"An Account of the Structure of Chinese Characters under 300 Primary Forms after the Shwoh-wan, 100 A.D., and Phonetic Shwoh-wan, 1833.\" This book, which was printed at Aberdeen in 1882, would probably become better known and more studied if a new edition were produced with the Chinese characters printed clearly and correctly. Among the Chinese books which Dr. Chalmers produced the most important is his \"Concise Kanghi,\" which also deserves to be better known. He also contributed to the China Review articles on Chinese etymology and phonetics, on Taoism, Han-w\u00ean-kung, and other Chinese subjects.\nIn Hongkong and Canton, Dr. Chalmers was much respected and beloved as a zealous, devoted, and wide-hearted missionary, and as a kind and genial friend and neighbour. His name will be long remembered there by English and Chinese, and his teaching and example will have a lasting influence. His contributions to our knowledge of the Chinese language, philosophy, religion, and literature, will give him an enduring place among the serious students of those departments of learning.\n\nT. W.\nIII. Notes and News.\n\nWe are pleased to hear that Professor A. A. Macdonell has been unanimously elected to the Boden Professorship of Sanskrit at Oxford.\n\nWe extract the following from the Cambridge University Reporter for 5th December, 1899:\n\nThe Vice-Chancellor publishes to the University the following Report which he has received from C. Bendall, M.A., of Gonville and Caius College, to whom a grant was made from the Worts Travelling Scholars Fund (Grace, 9th June, 1898):\n\nOUTLINE-REPORT ON A TOUR IN NORTHERN INDIA IN THE WINTER 1898\u20139.\n\nDear Mr. Vice-Chancellor,\u2014In accordance with the conditions of the grant above cited I beg leave to subjoin an outline of the tour which I have recently completed, for the information of Members of the Senate, in the hope of being able to publish, as in connection with my similar tour in 1884\u20135, a more detailed account later on.\n\nI landed at Bombay on 23rd November 1898, and commenced search for MSS. by conferring with Bhagran D\u0101s of Surat.\n\nI next visited, chiefly for architectural study, Ahmadabad and Mount Abu. At Jeypore the Digambara Jain pandit, Cimanl\u0101l, not only gave me a full list of his valuable manuscript library, from which copies can be made, but also presented me with several MSS. I further succeeded in obtaining some Digambara MSS. through my old friends amongst the Brahmans of the city. From Jeypore I proceeded to Delhi; whence I travelled with short stays at Agra and Allahabad to Kathmandu, Nepal, which formed the chief goal of my journey.\n\nBesides the acquisition of MSS. a second main object in my visit was the fuller exploration of the library of H.E. the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, of which I previously gave an unavoidably brief account.\n\nAmong several very interesting literary discoveries in this remarkable collection, I may here select two as of special interest: (1) fragments of a Pali canonical work written in a form of the\nGupta character; (2) of several Buddhist-Sanskrit works written in or about the fifth century A.D. The writing shows a striking resemblance to some of the early fragments of Indian origin recently found in Central Asia. Many of these leaves I photographed at the time, and I am glad to be now able to add that the most interesting of them have recently been sent to the India Office Library for my use, and for publication so far as resources may allow. I am greatly indebted to the Nepalese Durbar for this mark of confidence and appreciation, and to the Government of India for their intervention in the matter.\n\nContinuing also my work on the chronology of Nepal I noted all dates of MSS. giving names of kings in their colophons; which I now propose to publish in supplement to the list of the kings of Nepal, given in my longer Report, fourteen years ago.\n\nAs to epigraphic work, I discovered and copied some six inscriptions of the early period (5th\u20149th cent. A.D.), and I have either copied or noted a considerable number more of the succeeding centuries.\n\nIt gives me special pleasure to testify my obligations to the then Acting Prime Minister of Nepal, Deb Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana, who showed me not only personal kindness in many ways, but special practical sympathy in two respects: (1) in borrowing rare MSS. from private owners for my perusal; (2) by presenting me with two valuable MSS., one of which I propose with his approval to make over to the University Library, while the other, a unique work of considerable importance for the history of Buddhism, I intend shortly to edit. His Excellency further expressed to me his wish that the relations between the State Library of Nepal and libraries like our own in Europe could be drawn closer by mutually making known desiderata.\n\nThe second main division of my original programme was to make archaeological enquiries in the territory of H.H. the Nizam of Hyderabad.\n\nI accordingly proceeded to Hyderabad by the East Coast route, making on the way some search for inscriptions alleged to exist at several points, especially near Vizagapatam, as to which I may publish later further details.\n\nIn and near Hyderabad I was unable, owing to the somewhat advanced date of my arrival (Feb. 17th), to do much outdoor work; but I made several enquiries, which may hereafter prove valuable. My accomplished host, Shams-ul-Ulama Syed\n\n\"A Journey of . . . Research in Nepal and N. India.\" (University Press, 1886.)\n'Ali Bilgr\u0101mi, Public Works Secretary to the Nizam, presented me with several Sanskrit MSS. for the University Library. Proceeding to Aurungabad in the same State, I visited, for the study of archaeology, the cave-temples and monasteries of Aurungabad and Ellora. I examined carefully the chief group of caves near the first-named place, which are now somewhat neglected. As a result of my visit an important cave (No. iv), previously choked with rubbish, has now been cleared under the orders of my friend Syed 'Ali Bilgr\u0101mi.\n\nIn Aurungabad I also found and partly examined two noteworthy libraries of Sanskrit MSS., hitherto unknown to European scholars.\n\nAfter further study of cave-architecture at Bhaja and Karli I returned to Bombay. I left India on 3rd April, 1899.\n\nI propose shortly to submit to the University Librarian a statement of the MSS. obtained and available at once or ultimately for acquisition by the Library.\n\nI have also made a large number of photographs, which I am preparing for exhibition and for publication, according as opportunity may be afforded to me.\n\nI remain, dear Mr. Vice-Chancellor,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nNovember, 1899.\n\nCecil Bendall.\n\nPHILOLOGY NOTES, 1899.\n\nI. ASIA: (1) INDIA.\n\nI. Mr. George Grierson, of H.M. Indian Civil Service, now on special duty in India for the purpose of compiling a full and complete list of the Languages of that country, has in 1899 published in London (Luzac & Co.) and in Calcutta (Thacker, Spink, & Co.) an important work, \"Essays on Kashmiri Grammar,\" dedicated to the memory of our dear and lamented friend Dr. Georg B\u00fchler of Vienna. These Essays have originally appeared in the pages of the Journal of the Bengal Asiatic Society for 1896\u20131899. The Language is of interest to Comparative Philologists, as, to use the words of Mr. Grierson, \"no Indo-Aryan Language in her grammatical construction is so naked and\nunashamed. A study of Kashmiri, therefore, is a necessary preliminary to any inquiry, which deals comparatively with the mutual relations of the modern Aryan Vernaculars.\"\n\nThe Language had been previously represented by a useful little grammar from the pen of Mr. Wade, which is intended for those who seek to acquire a sufficient colloquial knowledge. Mr. Grierson's object is different, and is intended for linguistic scholars. As in other languages in North India, there are two Dialects of Kashmiri, the one used by the Hindu, the other by the Mahometan, who introduces Arabic and Persian words, which the Hindu avoids. This book illustrates the Dialect of the Hindu only, which represents a purer form of the original Kashmiri, in which all the old literature of the country is found. Two forms of Written Character prevail: the Arabic Character, modified by Persian usage, employed by the Mahometans, and the S\u00e1ra\u1e0da and Deva-N\u00e1gari Character by the Hindu. The S\u00e1ra\u1e0da is the true Alphabet of the Language, but Mr. Grierson for practical reasons has adopted the Deva-N\u00e1gari. To the 'Phonology' or 'Sound-Lore' a very large space in these Essays is consecrated, as it forms the groundwork of a rather complicated Grammar: once that is mastered, the 'Word-Lore,' and 'Sentence-Lore,' known to us as the Accidence and Syntax, are comparatively easy.\n\nII. A letter from the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam, dated October 18, 1899, has brought to the Royal Asiatic Society a pamphlet of a few pages entitled a \"Lushai Primer,\" called also \"Mizo Zir Tir Bu.\" There is not a word of English in the Pamphlet, but it is printed at the Government Press, Shillong, and \"by Authority.\"\n\nIII. By a singular coincidence, on the 11th November, 1899, I received from an entire stranger, Mr. Lorraine, a Missionary to the Lushai, a copy of a Grammar and Dictionary of the Lushai Language, prepared by himself and his colleague, Mr. Savidge. This is clearly a full and carefully prepared volume of 350 pages in the English\nlanguage, and the Lushai words in Roman character. This is also published at Shillong and at the Government Press, in the year 1898. The authors have returned from England, to which they paid a short visit, to the land of the Lushai.\n\nIV. Our venerated Honorary Member has in the days of his old age put forth a volume, which no one but himself could have compiled, \"The Six Systems of Indian Philosophy,\" by F. Max M\u00fcller. The aim and scope of this work are best indicated in the author's own words as \"a description of some of the salient points of each of the six recognized systems of Indian Philosophy.\" As he points out, the almost entire absence of any chronological data makes a historical treatment of the subject impossible. The book gives a luminous exposition of the conditions, amid which Indian Philosophy had its rise, and shows how it owes to these so many of its unique characteristics. The author then traces the genesis of philosophical ideas in the Veda\u2014the gradual development of those conceptions destined to play so great a part in the later philosophical systems of the country. Beginning with the system of the Ved\u0101nta, Professor Max M\u00fcller next sketches the main doctrines of each philosophical system in turn. Throughout he seeks to define as clearly as possible the various terms used and to throw light on the obscurer points of Indian Philosophy generally, though readily admitting the difficulties besetting the European interpreter in this respect. In the evolution of Indian Philosophy so many links are missing, that we must give up the idea of ever being able to reconstruct it in its original form, or trace back through all its gradations the development of a single, and that perhaps the simplest, Philosophical idea. Such, broadly speaking, is the conclusion of the author himself, though it in no way weakens his conviction, that here and there careful study may lead to the solution of problems hitherto regarded as insoluble. The book is distinguished by that lucidity of style and power of graphic representation so characteristic of all the author's writings.\nV. Dr. M. A. Stein, the distinguished Principal of the Oriental College at Lahore, has forwarded to me a pamphlet of seven pages entitled \"The Castle of Loh\u00e1ra,\" a reprint from the Indian Antiquary of September, 1897. Its interest is rather antiquarian, as it is alluded to in the Rajatar\u00e1ngini by Kalh\u00e1na, an annotated translation of which by Dr. Stein is now passing through the Press. A brief notice is sufficient, as copies of the Indian Antiquary are available in the Library of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nVI. \"The Great Indian Epics.\" This little book gives within the compass of some 250 pages a concise and graphic account of the subject-matter of the Ram\u00e1yana and Mah\u00e1-bh\u00e1rata. A sketch like this should appeal readily to that large class of people, who, with no knowledge of Sanskrit, yet wish to have some idea of the old literature enshrined in it. The scholar is but too prone to ignore the necessity of presenting these subjects in a popular and attractive form, and to look a little disdainfully on such 'compilations' as beneath his notice. Yet, in the present day, when a knowledge of the history and literature of India has become indispensable to the number of Englishmen connected directly or indirectly with that country, it is the writer, who can popularize his subject, rather than the scholar, who will be most sought after for information on these matters. The author, Mr. John Campbell Oman, Principal of Khalsa College, Amritsar, writes with an appreciation of the Indian epics and a sympathy with Indian ideas only to be found among those who, like himself, are personally familiar with Indians, their own experience of native life enabling them to understand allusions and views, which to the stranger would appear unintelligible or grotesque. The author wisely confines himself to a simple narrative of the plot and episodes of the respective epics, accompanied by brief introductory remarks elucidating these. The theories held by various scholars regarding the origin and history of the epics are touched upon, but there is no attempt to discuss them, such being outside the scope of a work like the present.\n(2) Asia except India.\n\nVII. \"Arabic Self-taught,\" by C. A. Thimm, F.R.G.S. This book has been received from the Editor for 'review.' The Language is one of supreme importance, and spoken either as the sole Vernacular or used as the literary Language of Millions. It has also merits of its own, and deserves more extensive study. I insert the description of the work supplied by the Editor: it is a mere booklet of 92 pages, and the price is 2s.\n\nThe above has been carefully revised by Professor G. Hagopian, who has made various emendations and improvements in it. The work is an elementary and practical treatise on the language, the Arabic characters being used, with a concise Grammar and an English-Arabic Dictionary, together with a correct English phonetic pronunciation of every word and phrase; the transliteration being arranged in accordance with the scheme adopted at the last Congress of Orientalists. It is a most useful adjunct to the \"Egyptian Self-taught,\" which only treats of the language as spoken in Egypt, for the benefit of Travellers and others. Students, therefore, will find the \"Arabic Self-taught\" sufficient to enable them to obtain an accurate grammatical and conversational knowledge of Arabic.\n\nVIII. Mr. D. G. Hogarth recently undertook the very interesting experiment of inviting a number of scholars, each of them engaged in some special branch of archaeology, to contribute essays to a work, the purpose of which was to indicate to what extent recent archaeological research had affected our conceptions of Biblical and Classical literature. This book has now been published under the title \"Authority and Archaeology, Sacred and Profane,\" and, while Mr. Hogarth appears both as a contributor and as general Editor, the names of Professor Driver, Professor Ernest Gardner, Mr. Griffith, Mr. Haverfield, and Mr. A. C. Headlam, also appear on the title-page. The largest single contribution to the volume is that of Professor Driver, to whom was\nentrusted the first part of the book, dealing with \"Biblical Authority,\" while by no means the least interesting portion of the volume is the short chapter contributed by Mr. Hogarth, on \"Prehistoric Greece.\" In a work of this nature, which embraces the whole field of ancient archaeology, to attempt an exhaustive treatment would naturally be quite impossible; and the contributors have wisely confined themselves to giving a sketch of the main results achieved in their various departments of study. The views expressed in the volume have not been arrived at by any common understanding, and each writer is responsible for those put forward in his own contribution; but, within its limits, the volume has successfully achieved a rapid survey of the archaeological field, and will prove a welcome guide to the general reader, who, without special archaeological knowledge, is interested in the history of ancient civilization.\n\nIX. \"Zoroaster, the Prophet of Ancient Iran,\" by Professor A. V. Williams Jackson, Columbia University. Few scholars have done more to elucidate the many difficult problems connected with the Zoroastrian religion and the history and date of its Founder than Professor Jackson, who has now summed up in the admirable book mentioned above the results of his long and careful studies. Trained in the German School, he has succeeded in combining German diligence and accuracy with an almost French lucidity and conciseness of exposition; and inspired by the firm conviction of his teacher Geldner as to the historical reality of the Prophet of Ancient Persia, he has made the fullest and yet most prudent use of the 'traditional school,' to whom, especially to West and Darmesteter, we are so deeply indebted for a knowledge of the Pahlavi literature. Some of Professor Jackson's results have already appeared in various articles not easily accessible to the public; amongst these his essays \"On the Date of Zoroaster\" (J.A.O.S., 1896), \"The Ancient Persian Doctrine of a Future Life\" (Biblical World, 1896), and \"Ormazd, or the Ancient Persian Idea of God\" (Monist, 1899) deserve mention. In his larger book on Zoroaster we\nfind for the first time a clear, full, and convincing presentation of a personality, so surrounded with fable and myth, that many persons have regarded him as wholly legendary. Professor Jackson has the great merits of being perfectly definite in his views, of presenting clearly and fairly the often conflicting evidences, of summing up with judicial impartiality, and of using all available sources. He endeavours to show (and [in our opinion with success]), (1) that Zoroaster was a real historical person; (2) that he flourished from B.C. 680 to B.C. 583; (3) that he was a native of N.W. Persia (\u0100dharb\u0101yj\u0101n), but that his chief successes in proselytizing were in the North-East (Bactria).\n\nX. In the Journal of our Society for 1895, I noticed at considerable length Professor Maspero's noble and epoch-making work \"The Dawn of Civilization,\" edited by Professor Sayce, and the work of translation excellently done by an accomplished lady, Mrs. Edmund McClure. The volume was a large quarto, with Map and 470 Illustrations. It contained the result of the most recent researches in Egypt and Chaldea.\n\nSince that date a second volume, equal in size, entitled \"The Struggle of the Nations,\" has been compiled by the Professor, and edited and translated by the same hands. It relates to Egypt, Syria, and Assyria.\n\nAnd now on December 2nd, 1899, the third volume is announced in The Times: \"The Passing of the Empires,\" 8100 B.C. to 330 B.C. This monumental work is, and must remain for some time to come, the most comprehensive and trustworthy account of the Ancient Eastern World, being compiled by the greatest living French Scholar in that particular branch, Professor Maspero, and edited in its English form by the greatest living English authority, Professor Sayce. I lay it upon myself to go carefully through vols. ii and iii, as I have already done for vol. i, but at the age of 79 promises are made, which cannot be kept. I only hope to contribute to our Journal the results of my perusal; for this reason I have inserted this brief notice of the existence of these important volumes.\nII. Africa.\n\nXI. Grammar and Dictionary of the Bobangi Language, Upper Congo, West Central Africa; compiled by John Whitehead, Baptist Missionary, 1899.\n\nThe people, who speak this form of speech, are found along the South bank of the great River Congo, below the junction of the Kasai with the Congo, also along the banks of the Mobango River for two or three days by steamer, and in a certain other less well-known Region. It is also used by stranger tribes over a larger area, as a commonly understood means of communication. It is the most important Vernacular from Stanley Pool to beyond Bang\u00e1la up-stream, and is freely used by the Authorities and Traders. Whatever literature exists, imported by Europeans, is in that Language. Attempt was made in 1888 to publish a handbook, and later on a Vocabulary and Grammatical Note; but the time had arrived for a more solid production, and this is now under our notice in the shape of a volume of 500 pages carefully prepared by the Author. A translation of St. Matthew's Gospel has also appeared.\n\nIII. Oceania.\n\nXII. The talents and the linguistic knowledge of Mr. Sydney Herbert Ray have been notified during the last year. Professor Haddon, of the Royal College of Science, Dublin, made a second expedition to Torres Straits, and was accompanied by Mr. Ray, who was thus able to strengthen his knowledge of the Languages of that Region. His knowledge of Melanesian and Papuan Languages is quite unique. The tour extended as far as Sarawak, and a considerable amount of material has been collected. Mr. Ray has already contributed to Periodicals, and learned Societies, no less than twenty-four articles, and we may anticipate a considerable number in addition. It is a pity that he is not placed in a position more favourable for his peculiar studies and capabilities than that of Master in a London Board School. More light is required in that dark corner of the globe, Oceania.\n\nDecember, 1899.\n\nR. N. Cust.\nGOLD MEDAL FUND.\n\nIn 1897 the Council of the Royal Asiatic Society established a Jubilee Gold Medal, to be awarded every third year, as an encouragement to Oriental learning amongst English-speaking people throughout the world; and to meet the expense contributions were invited from those interested in the scheme.\n\nA beautiful design was prepared, and dies engraved, by Mr. Pinches; the first Medal was awarded, on the report of a Committee of Selection, to Professor Cowell, and was presented to him by Lord Reay at a Special General Meeting of the Society, the proceedings of which will be found reported in the Journal for July, 1898.\n\nThe subscriptions (including interest on deposits) amounted to \u00a3298 13s. 6d., and the disbursements (including cost of die) to \u00a368 2s. 7\u00bdd., leaving a balance of \u00a3230 10s. 11\u00bdd., of which sum \u00a3215 6s. 0d. was expended in the purchase of Nottingham Corporation 3 per cent. Irredeemable Stock (a Trustee Stock), and there is therefore a small balance in hand of \u00a315 4s. 11\u00bdd. The amount invested forms the nucleus of an Endowment Fund; but as it is estimated that the cost of providing a Medal will amount to upwards of \u00a324, and as it is to be given every third year, the annual income required will be about \u00a38. To produce this, a sum of \u00a3300 will be needed, that is to say, about \u00a3100 in excess of the capital already raised.\n\nIt is hoped that this amount will be forthcoming during the next few months, so that on the presentation of the Medal in the Summer of 1900 it may be announced that the entire sum has been raised.\n\nContributions, which will be acknowledged in the Society's Journal, will be received by the Secretary, or the Chairman of the Committee of the Medal Fund.\n\nA.

The number of members was about six hundred. A notable feature in the geographical distribution of the membership was the attendance of Roumanians, which exceeded in number that of every other country except France, Germany, Great Britain, and Italy. The place of reunion was La Sapienza, the Roman University.\n\nThe Congress was opened on the evening of October 3rd, when Count Angelo de Gubernatis, President of the Committee of Organization, was elected Acting President of the Congress, and M. Graziadio Ascoli, Honorary President. The following Presidents of Sections were also elected:\n\nSECTION I.\nGeneral Indo-European Linguistic.\nMM. Ascoli, Bartholomae, Henry, Ludwig, and Thomsen.\n\nSECTION II (a).\nOriental Geography and Ethnography.\nMM. Cordier and Hermann, Col. Temple, and M.

Count de Gubernatis then reviewed the situation in an eloquent French harangue, dwelling on the unsurpassed 'universality' in the nature of the assembled Congress, touching on the loss sustained by the death of B\u00fchler, Sch\u00e4fer, Socin, and Leitner, deploring the illness of Professors Max M\u00fcller and Weber, Barbier de Meynard and Br\u00e9al, and regretting the absence of M. Maspero, Lord Reay, and Prince Roland Bonaparte. Thereupon certain of the delegates delivered brief addresses to the King's representative and the President, among them being Sir Raymond West, for the Royal Asiatic Society, and Sir Charles Lyall, for the Government of British India.\nLa idea de que la ciencia debe ser accesible a todos los estudiantes es una de las principales motivaciones para el desarrollo de este proyecto.

IX.\u2014A Sanskrit Deed of Sale concerning a Kashmirian Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata Manuscript. By M. A. Stein.\n\nThe manuscript to which the present note refers was purchased by me at Srinagar in October, 1898. It is written in S\u0101rad\u0101 characters, and contains the Gada, Sauptika, Stri, and Asvamedha Parvans of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. The manuscript acquired by me originally formed only a portion of a codex which must have contained the whole of the great Sanskrit epic. This is made clear by the curious notice I shall proceed to discuss, as well as by the fact that other portions of the codex have been seen by me in Srinagar during earlier visits. The whole must have formed two large folio volumes which, judging from the writing and the paper, were probably copied in the sixteenth century, or in the early part of the seventeenth. The manuscript is very carefully written, evidently by the hand of a Pandit, and represents a very good specimen of the text of the Western recension of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata current in Kashmir.\n\nThe interest which this manuscript possesses for us does not, however, lie in the text it presents, but in certain later additions it has received. When the manuscript was\nbrought to me for sale I did not fail at once to notice numerous marginal notes and corrections from a work which I had become familiar enough for a series of years back. Ever since I prepared and published an edition of the Sanskrit text of Kalhana's Rajatarangini from the codex archetypus secured by me in Kashmir, I have endeavoured to trace the identity of a certain glossator whose hand that codex owes an extensive series of important notes, supplements, and various readings. I have discussed the value and peculiar interest of the work of this glossator whom I designated as A2, in the critical preface of my edition.1 I had shown there from internal evidence that A2 was probably the oldest among the annotators of the codex archetypus, and apparently a contemporary of Ratnakaptha himself, the scholarly scribe of the codex archetypus.\n\nSince the publication of my edition I have repeatedly examined manuscripts of other Sanskrit texts which I saw or acquired in Kashmir, come across learned glosses and notes in the handwriting of A2. They fully confirmed the estimate I formed of the learning and accuracy of the anonymous glossator. But in none of these texts had I been able to discover a clue to his identity. All the more gratified I felt when I found that the manuscript purchased by last Autumn presented this clue, and in the form of a record as authentic and precise as it could be desired.\n\nThe record is furnished by a curious deed of sale which is endorsed on the obverse of the first leaf of the Asvamedha Parvan, and of which a slightly reduced reproduction is shown in the accompanying plate. The Deed is made out both in Persian and Sanskrit. It is the latter version which being written and signed by the glossator A2, must engage our special attention. Its text runs as follows:\n\natra sauvatsare vasu\u015barasamkhye \u0101\u015brayanjam\u0101se sitetarapal\ntithau pratipady\u0101n gurur\u0101s\u0101r\u0101ntay\u0101m || sanvat 58 \u0101\u015ba a\n\n1 See Kalhana's Rajatarangini, ed.

U. Maulwi Ahmad, Head-Maulwi, Calcutta Madrasah, as follows:\n\n---\n\nFor the identification of Didd\u0101matha, still a favourite quarter of the \u015arinagar Brahmans and known to the Pandits by its ancient name, compare note vi, 303, in my forthcoming translation of the R\u0101jatar\u0101\u1e45gi\u1e47\u012b.\ntwo volumes containing the whole text of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata for 45,000 Din\u0101ras to one designated \"the worshipful Guru \u0100nanda.\" The date is given as Thursday, the 8th day of the dark half of \u0100\u015bvayuja, in the Laukika or Saptar\u1e63i year [47] 58. This by calculation and the evidence of the Muhammadan date in the Persian version (A.H. 1093) is shown to correspond to Thursday, the 10th July, 1682 A.D. The writer of the Sanskrit Deed, who appears to have acted as intermediary at the transaction, and who by his handwriting proves himself identical with the glossator A\u2082, signs himself as Takunde Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da Haraka.\n\nThe recorded date of the sale shows beyond all doubt that I was right in assuming that A\u2081, or, as we must now call him, Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da Haraka, was a contemporary of R\u0101j\u0101naka Ratnakau\u1e6dha. Manuscripts by the hand of the latter scholar, which I successively examined or purchased, show dates ranging from A.D. 1648 to A.D. 1685. Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da Haraka has annotated and revised, not only the archetype of the R\u0101jatarangin\u012b, but also a considerable number of other manuscripts which Ratnakau\u1e6dha had copied evidently for his own use. From this it may be inferred with great\n\n---\n\n1 As \u0100nanda is given in the Persian version the family name \u1e24ajj\u0101j, i.e., Raj\u0101naka, it is possible that \u0100nanda R\u0101j\u0101naka, a well-known Kashmirian scholar of the second half of the seventeenth century, is meant; compare Professor Aufrecht's Catalogus Catalogorum, s.v. \u0100nanda. \u0100nanda R\u0101j\u0101naka's commentary on the N\u0101gad\u0101sakarita, of which a copy was acquired by Professor B\u00fchler in Kashmir (see Report, p. x, No. 143), was composed A.D. 1654. P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dit tradition in Kashmir has retained a recollection of a close personal connection between \u0100nanda and R\u0101j\u0101naka Ratnakau\u1e6dha, the writer of the R\u0101jatarangin\u012b codex.\n\n2 Glosses, various lections, etc., from the hand of A\u2082 or Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da Haraka are found in the following manuscripts written by R\u0101j\u0101naka Ratnakau\u1e6dha and now in my possession:\n\n   i. R\u0101yamukuta's commentary on the Amarako\u015ba (No. 6 of my collection).\n   ii. Amarako\u015ba (No. 9).\n   iii. K\u0101\u015byapav\u1e5bttiv\u0101ra\u1e47apu\u1e47\u1e0draka (No. 33).\n   iv.

Bh\u0101ga's Har\u1e63acarita (recently obtained by me from Bhadrav\u0101h territory).\n\nFor other manuscripts showing notes of Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da Haraka, compare the Introduction to my forthcoming translation of the R\u0101jatarangin\u012b, \u00a7 47.\n\nTakunde (pronounced Takur\u1e0d, as the use of the \u015a\u0101rad\u0101 character for \u1e6d\u1e6d shows) is evidently the 'Kr\u0101m' or family name borne by the learned glossator.\nprobability that he was a constant companion, and probably a pupil, of that distinguished Ka\u015bmirian scholar and author.\n\nThe document we have just examined is of interest, not only on account of the light it throws on the person and date of 'A.,' but also on account of its form and the monetary information it furnishes. Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da Haraka's record is the first formal Sanskrit Deed which, as far as I know, has yet come to light in Ka\u015bmir. It is, therefore, all the more interesting to note that in its form and phraseology it agrees closely with the formularies for such documents given in that most curious and valuable Ka\u015bmirian text, the Lokaprak\u0101\u015ba.\n\nIt is impossible on the present occasion to refer in detail to the many points of antiquarian interest furnished by that text from which Professor Weber has recently published valuable extracts.\u00b9 Nor can I attempt here to explain the difficulties besetting the question as to the date and origin of its varied contents. It must suffice to point out that the discovery of an actual contract drawn up at the end of the seventeenth century, in close conformity with the forms prescribed by the Lokaprak\u0101\u015ba, strongly supports the belief first expressed by Professor B\u00fchler, and also held by myself, that we have in the Lokaprak\u0101\u015ba a genuine handbook of official and business routine as current in Ka\u015bmir.\u00b2 Although distinctly old in its origin and in some of its materials, it has undergone numerous adaptations to the changed conditions of later periods, down to the time of the Mughals.\n\nAnother item of useful information for the student of Ka\u015bmir antiquities is supplied by the record of the sale price in the deed. The amount of 45,000 Dinn\u0101ras would\n\n\u00b9 See Indische Studien, vol. xx, pp. 290\u2013412.\n\u00b2 The close connection between the formularies of the Lokaprak\u0101\u015ba and our deed of sale is curiously illustrated also by the various points of bad grammar exhibited in the text of the latter. Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da Haraka, who in his glosses shows a scholarly knowledge of Sanskrit and wide reading, would scarcely have committed himself to the several barbarous expressions found in the Deed (e.g. Adiparvam \u0101rabhya Aranyakaparvam t\u0101v\u0113t) if their use had not been approved by custom in similar contemporary documents.\nappear strangely extravagant to those who know the term Dinn\u0101ra in Sanskrit texts of India proper only as the designation of a gold coin. The question as to the real value of the Dinn\u0101ra so frequently mentioned in Kalhana's Chronicle and some other Ka\u015bm\u012brian texts, has been first examined by me in a long note of my forthcoming commentary on the R\u0101jatarangin\u012b, which has been reprinted also in the July number of the Numismatic Chronicle. I believe to have proved there that the term Dimnara (regularly abbreviated into Di in the formulas of the Lokaprak\u0101sa, as in our deed) applied in Ka\u015bmir not to a real coin, but to a particular currency based on a decimal system of values, starting from a very small unit and represented mainly by a copper coinage.\n\nWithout going into detailed explanations, for which the present note does not afford room, I may mention that during the centuries preceding the Muhammadan conquest four of the well-known copper coins of the later Hindu rulers of Ka\u015bmir were counted as equivalent to \"hundred Dinnaras,\" called also simply in Skr. \u015b\u0101la, 'a hundreder,' or in Ks. h\u0101th. Owing to a gradual course of debasement, which can be traced through the whole history of the Hindu coinage of Ka\u015bmir and of the Muhammadan coinage succeeding it, the h\u0101th or 'hundreder' was in Akbar's time, as clearly shown by a statement of Ab\u016b-l-Fazl, only equal to $\\frac{1}{4}$ of a Rupee. The S\u0101s\u016bn or 'thousander,' the old Sahasra, accordingly then represented a value of not more than $\\frac{1}{8}$ of a Rupee.\n\nThe deterioration of the values representing the old currency of Ka\u015bmir has continued down to modern times. According to the system of reckoning which I have found still current in Ka\u015bmir both among \u1e62arr\u0101fs and villagers, the term h\u0101th is now applied to a copper coin corresponding in value to the British pice. Ten coppers are still reckoned as one 'thousander' (S\u0101s\u016bn), which thus has now come to represent only the value of $2\\frac{1}{2}$ Annas. It is probable that\n\n---\n\n1 See Note II (iv. 495); Numismatic Chronicle, 1899, vol. xix. pp. 123-174.\nat the time when Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da Haraka wrote his sale record, the value of a 'thousand Dinn\u0101ras' was still nearer to Ab\u016b-l-Fa\u017cl's estimate of \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of a Rupee. But even if we accept this higher value, the price paid for the manuscript, 45,000 Dinn\u0101ras, must appear, on the face of it, remarkably low, considering the bulk of the great epic contained in the complete codex (circ. 110,000 \u015blokas).\u00b9\n\nThis low price paid for the manuscript is, however, fully accounted for by the extreme cheapness which prevailed in old Ka\u015bmir, and for which in the above quoted paper I have furnished a series of remarkable illustrations extending over centuries. Here it may suffice to point out that we can easily arrive at a more correct estimate of the intrinsic value represented by the price paid, if we remember that in Ab\u016b-l-Fa\u017cl's time the commutation rate of a Kharw\u0101r of rice, equivalent to 177 lbs. avoirdupois, was about 1,300 Dinn\u0101ras, or 13 h\u0101ths. The 45,000 Dinn\u0101ras paid for the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata codex would at this rate have sufficed to purchase about 35 Kharw\u0101rs, or 88 Maunds of rice, which gives, perhaps, a more adequate idea of the sale profit realized by Autt\u0101raka's family.\n\n\u00b9 The entry in the Persian version of 225 'Tankas' as the equivalent of 45,000 Din\u0101ras does not assist us in the calculation, as it is not clear what particular coin is meant by that designation. As the tanka is made equal to 200 Din\u0101ras or two h\u0101ths, a copper coin is evidently intended.

Browne, M.A., M.R.A.S.\n\nTo the curious book of which the full title stands at the head of this article, I have already alluded in my communication to the Journal of January, 1899, on The Sources of Daulatshah, pp. 51\u201353. I now propose to give such account of its contents as is possible within the limits here prescribed. For this purpose I have made use of the Cambridge Codex (belonging to the Burckhardt Collection) marked Qo. 225. Though the book is a rare one, at least three other manuscripts are known\u2014two in the British Museum (see the old Arabic Catalogue, pp. 418 and 581)\u00b9 and one (marked A. 1741) at Gotha. The last was used by Professor N\u00f6ldeke, in his reference to the Nih\u0101yat, at pp. 475\u2013476 of his excellent Geschichte der Sasaniden. He describes it as \"in the main a quite arbitrary recension of Dinawari, though here [namely, in the Romance of Bahram Chubin] it had before it an essentially fuller text than this,\" and briefly characterizes it as \"das seltsame, ziemlich schwindelhafte Werk.\" When I first lighted on the book at Cambridge, not being aware of the existence of other copies, or of N\u00f6ldeke's unfavourable judgment as to its value, I was elated beyond measure, believing that I had at last found the substance of that\n\n\u00b9 These MSS., marked Add. 18,505 and Add. 23,298, I have only examined superficially, but enough to satisfy myself as to their identity. The former is a poor and inaccurate text, and is incomplete, the end corresponding with f. 185b of the Cambridge Codex. It presents a rather different text in places, and is entitled in the colophon T\u0101r\u012bkh\u0101n'l-Amm\u0101r\u012b. The other, dated A.H. 1043, more closely agrees with our codex, and is entitled in the colophon \"Kit\u0101bu'n-Nih\u0101yat, which is the Siyaru'l-Muluk.\"\nprecious translation of the Sasanian \"Book of Kings\" (Khudh\u00e1y-n\u00e1mak) made about the middle of the eighth century by the eminent 'Abdu'll\u00e1h Ibnu'l-Muqaffa', who, born and brought up a Zoroastrian, made a profession of Islam of doubtful sincerity, and was put to death about A.D. 760. The Siyaru'l-Muluk, by which title his Arabic version of the Pahlavi \"Book of Kings\" (compiled in all probability in its final form, as N\u00f6ldeke has shown, during the reign of Yazdigird III, the last Sasanian king) is generally known and cited, is professedly the chief, if not the only source of those portions of the Nih\u00e1yat which deal with Persian history; nay, the Nih\u00e1yat actually pretends to have incorporated in itself this important work, the source whence most of the early Muslim historians chiefly drew their information about ancient Persia, but which, it is to be feared, is, in its original form, absolutely and irrecoverably lost. These pretensions can best be made clear by a translation of its preface, which contains all the direct information as to the alleged circumstances of its compilation vouchsafed to us by its author.\n\n[F. 6b.] \"Praise be to God, the Lord of the Worlds, than whom there is no other God, the Best of Creators; and may God bless Muhammad, the Seal of the Prophets.

And while I was thus entertaining him one night, he said, 'O Asma'i, where are these kings and princes?' 'O Prince of Believers,' I replied, 'they have gone their way.' Then he lifted up his hand to heaven and said, 'O Destroyer of Kings, have mercy upon me on that day when thou joinest me unto them!' Then he summoned \u015e\u00e1l\u00edh, the Keeper of his Oratory, and said, 'Go to the\n\n1 A distinguished Arabic philologist, born A.D. 740, died A.D. 831.

Then said he: \"O A\u1e63ma'i, the beginning of this book, as thou seest, is from Shem the son of Noah. Hast thou knowledge of the sequence of events from the time of Adam (on whom be Peace), and of what hath been inherited by each successor from the Past, and from the first by the last?\" Then he continued: \"O A\u1e63ma'i, see what was before Shem the son of Noah by way of legends and events, and set them in their right order, and make mention therein of all such as ruled from the time of Adam (on whom be Peace) until it came to Shem the son of Noah, which is the beginning of this book as it is [here] written, king by king and episode by episode; and seek assistance herein of Abu'l-Bakhtari the jurisconsult.\"\n\n\"So when it was morning I came to Abu'l-Bakhtari and told him what the Prince of Believers had commanded, and the \"Book of Origins\" (Kitabu'l-Mubtada') was sent for, and we transcribed from it this portion, which we placed at the beginning of the \"Chronicles of the Kings\" (Sigaru'l-Muluk), keeping it apart.

Thereafter from amongst his sons Seth assumed the vicegerency, until [in course of time] it came to Enoch (Akhn\u00fakh), the son of Mahalaleel (Mah\u00e1l\u00e1'il), the son of Cainan (Qayn\u00e1n), the son of Enos (An\u00fash), the son of Seth (Shith), the son of Adam, and passed to him. And Enoch was Idr\u00eds the Prophet (may God bless him), and he was so called only by reason of his assiduous study (dird\u00e1sat) of the Books of Adam and Seth. Then [we continue with] the Chronicles [f. 7a] which succeed this, until such time as God sent Noah to summon his people unto Him, and [with] the story of the Deluge, and what happened thereafter until Noah's death. This section was added at the beginning of the \"Chronicles of the Kings\" in this place, and we kept it separate therefrom, and constituted it an introduction to that book (it comprising some ten leaves), in such wise that the two form a continuous narrative.\"\n\nThis Introduction, of which the scope is adequately indicated above, has no reference to the history of Persia, either legendary or actual, and makes no mention of Ibnu'l-Mugaffa', so that a brief mention of its contents, and of the authorities cited by Abu'l-Bakhtari (who is represented as the author), will suffice. Contents: Creation of man.\u2014Adam and Eve and the Serpent.\u2014Birth of Cain and Abel and their twin sisters.\u2014Murder of Abel.\u2014Birth of Seth.\u2014Account of Idr\u00eds (Enoch) and Noah.

This Introduction ends (f. 14a, l. 9) with the words \"the portion added to the Chronicles of the Kings is finished.\" At this point we resume the translation.\n\n\"This is the beginning of the Book of the Chronicles (Kit\u00e1b\u00fa's-siyar), which ceased not to be preserved by the Caliphs, unto whom may God Most High be merciful!\n\n1 Cf.

Verily hath God (blessed and exalted is He!) established dominion amongst the peoples of the earth, and made it fugitive and transitory, only as a type of His Kingdom which declineth not, and His Rule which passeth not away.\n\n\"These are legends of bygone kings and former nations and past ages; of the Tyrants (al-Jababira), the Kings of Yaman (al-Tahibba) and the Monarchs of Persia (al-Akasa), with accounts of their circumstances, their histories, their burial-places, and their lives, and of what hath been recorded by the Arabs and the Persians concerning their wars, their raids, their poems, their wise sayings, their customs, their harangues, their letters, and their decisions, from the time of Shem the son of Noah until God sent Muhammad, whom may He bless and keep in peace!\n\n\"Now they who compiled and composed this book, and set it in order and perfected its arrangement, having heard [the incidents therein recorded] from learned men worthy of credence, were 'Amir ash-Sha'bi and Ayyub ibnul-Qirriyya, who were amongst the wisest of the Arabs who concerned themselves with the affairs of former peoples and were acquainted with what had occurred in past ages. And herein they were aided by 'Abdu'llah ibnul-Muqaffa', one of the most learned of the Persians in the Chronicles of their Kings, and the most profoundly versed in the knowledge of their affairs, the fruits of their culture, and the most signal achievements of their wisdom. And he who convened them [i.e. ash-Sha'bi, Ibnul-Qirriyya, and\n\n1 His full name was Ab\u00fa 'Amr 'Amir b. Sharabba. His mother was one of the prisoners captured by the Arabs at Jalilah (A.H. 12). He died in A.H. 104 or 105, aged 77. See The Quatrain, p. 239; Fawaris, pp. 73, 74 and the notes.\n\n2 See The Quatrain, pp. 46 and 206. He was noted for his eloquence, and was put to death by al-Hajjaj because he was suspected of inclining to the party of Hamzah.\nIbnu'l-Muqaffa' was 'Abdu'l-Malik ibn Marw\u00e1n, in the year 85\" [of the hijra = A.D. 704].\n\nNow this introduction is more than suspicious; since, apart from the fact that Arabic prose literature hardly began until the 'Abb\u00e1sid period (late eighth century of our era), that the general style and structure of the Nih\u00e1yat are utterly unlike the older historical works composed in Arabic, that we have no record of any such enterprise, and that it is in the highest degree improbable that 'Abdu'l-Malik the Omayyad Caliph (reigned A.D. 685\u2013705) should have troubled himself at all about the legends of the ancients, the association of Ibnu'l-Muqaffa', who was put to death at a comparatively early age about A.D. 757, with a Caliph who died more than half a century before this date, and with two collaborators of whom one died in A.D. 724 and the other some thirty-five years earlier, is a glaring anachronism. Yet though the framework of the book is clearly false, it does not necessarily follow that its contents are equally worthless. So learned and early a writer as al-J\u00e1hidh (d. A.D. 869) complained that his contemporaries were so indifferent to modern merit, however conspicuous, that he was compelled to attribute his own writings to older authors, like Ibnu'l-Muqaffa' (d. A.D. 757), in order to secure for them a circulation.\u00b9 One's impulse, on detecting such false pretensions in a work on which one has spent considerable time and labour, is to cast it aside in disgust, and so I did with the Nih\u00e1yat after I had read it carefully through, translated a considerable portion of it, and made a careful analysis of the rest.\n\nBaron Rosen's interesting article on the Khud\u00e1y-n\u00e1mak, or S\u00e1s\u00e1n\u00edan \"Book of Kings,\" published on the occasion of the Centenary of the \u00c9cole des Langues Orientales in the Vostochniya Zamy\u00e9tki (St. Petersburg, 1895, pp. 153\u2013191), first brought about a reaction in my mind in favour of the Nih\u00e1yat. For the story about King Bal\u00e1sh\n\n\u00b9 See al-Mas'\u00fadi's Kit\u00e1b\u00fc't-tanbih wa'l-ishr\u00e1f, ed. De Goeje, p. 76.\n(Vologeses) and his two wives (the Indian Princess and the Groom's daughter) there given on the authority of al-Kisrawi (about A.D. 870), and recovered from later works wherein he is cited, occurs also in an equally full or fuller form in the *Nihayat*, which also, as observed by N\u00f6ldeke, gives in an unusually complete and detailed form the Legend of Bahr\u00e1m Ch\u016bb\u00edn. The *Nihayat* agrees in the main with Dinawari (d. A.D. 895), but is often fuller; and since the additional matter which it contains can be shown in several cases to occur also in old writers of high repute, like al-Kisrawi, whose works are lost save for fragments quoted by their successors, it appears to merit careful examination, as a source whence we may hope to increase our knowledge of the half-historical, half-legendary contents of the Pahlavi \"Book of Kings.\"\n\nTo another feature common to the *Nihayat* and *Dinawari* I have called attention in the article already mentioned, namely, the occurrence of Persian words and phrases cited in the original. In Dinawari, for instance, we find, besides numerous Persian titles like *Ishbahbud* (= *Spahbed*, *Sipahbad*, \"commander-in-chief\"), *Hazir-fat*\u00b9 (= *Hazirpet*, *Hazirbad*, \"captain of a thousand\"), short phrases like \"Zeh suw\u00e1r!\" (\"Bravo, horseman!\" p. 105), \"Mard u mard\" (\"Man to man,\" as a challenge to single combat, p. 130), \"D\u00edr\u00e1d imadand!\" (\"The demons are come!\" p. 133), and the like. In the *Nihayat* such phrases (accompanied in every case, so far as I recollect, by an Arabic translation) are more numerous. I cited one connected with the story of Wahriz and the words *zun \u00e1n* in my former article,\u00b2 and I will now give a few more instances. \"Sh\u00e1h-i-jah\u00e1n\" (f. 110b) is correctly explained as \"Rabbu'd-dunya,\" \"Lord of the World.\" The epithet applied to Yazdigird I, given by Arab writers as \"al-Athim,\" is given (f. 123a) in its Persian\n\n\u00b9 Cf.

Says \u2018Abdu\u2019ll\u00e1h Ibnu\u2019l-Muqaffa': 'I find in the books of the Persians the combat of Rustam and Isfandiy\u00e1d; and that the cause of this was that Busht\u00e1sf, the son of Bukht-Nus\u0161ar (for the Arabs call Luhr\u00e1sf Bukht-Nus\u0161ar), when King Zar\u00e1du\u0161t (Zoroaster) came to him, saying,\u00b9 'I am an Apostle from the Lord of the Worlds unto thee, and unto the people of my country, and of thy kingdom, to invite thee unto the Religion of the Magians,' Busht\u00e1sf [I say] replied, 'And what is the Religion of the Magians?' And [Zoroaster] answered, 'That marriage with sisters and mothers and daughters is lawful unto thee; and the worship of the Sun and of Fire.' So Busht\u00e1sf hearkened unto that whereunto the accursed one\u00b2 invited him as to the abandonment of his religion in which he had been; and he went over to the religion of the Magians, and induced the people of his country to do the same, so that, willing or no, they acquiesced. Now at the beginning of the reign of Busht\u00e1sf there had marched against him from the country of Egypt a king of the children of H\u00e1m at the head of a thousand thousand men of the people of his kingdom. And Busht\u00e1sf went forth\n\n\u00b9 = Dinawari, p. 27. The passages which occur in D. are here placed in italics.\n\u00b2 This epithet, of course, as well as the summary account of the Zoroastrian creed, is an addition of Muhammadan origin.\nto meet him with his hosts, having with him his son Isfandiy\u00e1d; and they fought a fierce fight, and the victory was to the sons of H\u00e1m over Busht\u00e1sf, and they took him captive. And Rustam was in his home in Sajist\u00e1n. Now men differ as to the genealogy of Rustam. Some of the learned men of the Persians say that he was of the sons of Tasn b. N\u00fah, who were mighty kings; while some say that his mother was [f. 456] Tasmiyya and his father of the posterity of Nimrod, the son of Kin'\u00e1n, and that thence he was gifted with largeness of frame, strength of body, and natural might. And when news came to Rustam that Busht\u00e1sf had been taken prisoner, he equipped himself with twelve thousand men of the people of Sajist\u00e1n, and marched on the track of the King of the sons of H\u00e1m, who was at the head of two thousand thousand men, after [deducting] those of his followers who had been killed. And [Rustam] fought with him until he delivered Busht\u00e1sf from his hands, and drove him forth from his [Busht\u00e1sf's] kingdom. And when Busht\u00e1sf returned unto his capital, he crowned Rustam with a crown, and made him king over Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n and Sajist\u00e1n, and permitted him to sit on a throne of gold, and bestowed on him many lands in fief, and exalted his rank, and gave him precious gifts; and so he returned to Sajist\u00e1n. But when it came to his ears that Busht\u00e1sf had abandoned the religion of his fathers, and had agreed to that whereunto Zoroaster invited him of the Magian religion, he was angered thereat with a great anger, and said, 'He hath left the faith of our forefathers, which the last of us have inherited from the first, and hath inclined towards the religion of Zoroaster the infidel.' Then he resolved to depose him, and assembled the nobles of his people, and told them what the King had done in abandoning the faith of his forefathers and embracing another faith, and proclaimed to them his deposition. And they supported him in this, and renounced their allegiance to Busht\u00e1sf and his son Isfandiy\u00e1d, who was the strongest man of his time, and whose skin the Arabs\n\n1 = D., p. 28, which ends the sentence \"to a new religion.\"\nsuppose to have been of brass.\\footnote{He is called in Persian \u0631\u064f\u0636\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u064e\u0646, i.e. \"having a body of [i.e. strong and tough as] brass.\"} Then said Isfandiy\u0101d's father to him: 'O my son, verily the kingdom will come to thee shortly, and thine affairs will not prosper unless thou shalt kill Rustam and be quit of him. Thou knowest his strength and his power: choose, therefore, what thou wilt from the hosts, and march against him, and bid him return to his allegiance. If he consents, and desists from his present course of action, well and good; if not, fight with him; and I trust that thou may'st conquer him, since thou art his equal in strength and power.' So Isfandiy\u0101d chose from the hosts of his father twelve thousand men of the most valiant warriors of Persia, and then marched against Rustam. And news of this reached Rustam, and he came forth to meet him with the men of Khur\u0101s\u0101n and Sajist\u0101n, advancing towards him. And the two armies met in the district of Q\u016bmis, and stood facing one another in battle array.\\footnote{For these two sentences D. substitutes: \"And Rustam came forth to meet him, and they met between the countries of Sajist\u0101n and Khur\u0101s\u0101n.\"} And Isfandiy\u0101d cried out, 'Where is Rustam? Let him come forth, that I may speak with him!' So Rustam came forth, and Isfandiy\u0101d said, 'What hath impelled thee to disown thine allegiance to the King and to revolt against him?' Rustam replied, 'I am displeased at what he hath done in abandoning his faith and the faith of his forefathers, and in following Zoroaster in the religion of the Magians, and entering into it.' Isfandiy\u0101d answered: 'Verily the King perceived what would befall him from thee in his affairs; abandon, then, continuance in rebellion, and return unto thine allegiance, and remember what [kindness] hath been done to thee by him, and what honour he hath shown thee, and how he exalted thy station [f. 46a] when thou wert living in obscurity in thy land, neglected in thy country.' Rustam answered: 'Verily his obligations to me are greater than my obligations to him, inasmuch as I delivered him from\n\n\\footnote{In D. the remainder of the narrative occupies only seven lines. The words \"And the Persians tell many tales about this\" (i.e. the combat between R. and I.) stand for the elaborate details here given.}\ndeath after that he had come nigh unto it; neither will I return to his allegiance until he renounces the religion of the Magians and returns to the faith of our fathers, and otherwise I will fight with him and challenge him to equal combat.' Said Isfandiy\u00e1d: 'Verily it is not just that captains should lead their troops into positions of peril and spare themselves. Make, therefore, a firm covenant with me, and I will make the like with thee, that thou wilt spare the two armies from battle, and that the fight shall be between me and thee alone, thou contending with me and I with thee; and whichever shall slay his opponent shall take possession of his kingdom, and unto him shall its people turn.' Rustam answered, 'This is granted thee, and to this I consent, for it is fair.' So they bound themselves by an oath to this, and mutually agreed thereunto, and the two armies stood in their ranks under their standards while Isfandiy\u00e1d went forth unto Rustam, and they fought a fierce fight until night intervened between them. And the arms of Rustam could not touch Isfandiy\u00e1d by reason of the hardness of his skin, while Isfandiy\u00e1d could not prevail against Rustam because of his strength and power. So they continued thus forty days. Then Rustam resolved on treachery to Isfandiy\u00e1d, and drew up his hosts in battle array, and rushed upon the army of Isfandiy\u00e1d and made a great slaughter of them. And when it was morning, Isfandiy\u00e1d sent unto Rustam, saying: 'O miscreant and traitor, thou hast broken the pact and betrayed thy trust and pledges which thou didst pledge me and wherewith thou didst covenant with me: come forth unto us to do battle!' So Rustam went forth unto him, and Isfandiy\u00e1d shot at him a thousand arrows, whereof not one missed its mark, and the wounds weakened Rustam so that he came near to falling from weakness. Then Isfandiy\u00e1d cried to him, saying: 'This is enough for thee to-day: get thee back, for we are wearied of fighting.' Rustam answered: 'I accord thee this: turn back, for verily one like me is not invited unto anything wherein an equal is concerned but he accepts.' So Rustam turned back, and\ncame at length unto a deep river in his path, and his horse Rakshah was unable to cross over it because of its depth. So Rustam dismounted and put his head between the fore-legs and the hind-legs of his steed, and carried him on his neck until he had crossed over the river with him. And Isfandiy\u00e1d, beholding this, said to his followers: 'Do ye not see how Rustam, notwithstanding the wounds in his body, hath been able to carry his horse, which is one of the stoutest of steeds? There is not the like of him amongst the Persians!' And Rustam spent the whole night plucking out the arrow-heads from his body until it was morning. Then he summoned a soothsayer who was with him, and said, 'What thinkest thou about Isfandiy\u00e1d?' 'My opinion,' replied the soothsayer, 'is that thou wilt soon slay him [f. 46b], but that thou wilt not long survive him ere thou too shalt perish.' 'I care not,' said Rustam, 'what befalls me so that I kill him; but how shall I contrive to kill him when my weapons make no impression on his skin?' 'No weapons,' replied the soothsayer, 'will make any impression on it save the branches of the tamarisk which is in an island called the Island of K\u00e1zar\u00fan.' And when Rustam heard this, he sent to Isfandiy\u00e1d to request a postponement of the battle, holding out hopes of a return to his allegiance; and Isfandiy\u00e1d consented to this. So Rustam embarked on a ship until he came to this island, which was one of the dependencies of Tabarist\u00e1n; and he cut from the tamarisk three shafts. Then he returned and made them arrows, fitting them with points and feathers. Then he sent to Isfandiy\u00e1d challenging him to battle, and he came forth unto him, and Rustam shot him with these arrows in a mortal place, and he died. Then his hosts returned unto Bushl\u00e1sf and informed him of what had happened as to the death of his son Isfandiy\u00e1d and the cause thereof; and thereat sorrow overcame him, and he sickened with the sickness whereof he died. And he bequeathed the kingdom to his grandson Bahman, the son of Isfandiy\u00e1d,1 and then died.\n\n1 = D., 28, ll. 13\u201315, which continues: \"And when Rustam returned unto his abode in the land of Sajist\u00e1n it was not long ere he died.\"\nAnd after the destruction of Isfandiy\u00e1d, Rustam went forth to the chase, and there sprang up before him a wild ass, and he galloped after it, and came, while his horse was at full gallop, to a well, and fell into it, and died. But it is said [by others] that the wounds inflicted upon him by Isfandiy\u00e1d's arrows overcame him so that he died. And Busht\u00e1sf reigned a hundred and twenty years, and was succeeded by Bahman, the son of Isfandiy\u00e1d, the son of Busht\u00e1sf.\"\n\nContinuation of Abstract (f. 46b).\n\nAccount of Bahman the son of Isfandiy\u00e1d.\u2014He marries [D. 29, Tr\u00e1kht] the daughter of Salm\u00e1l [D. 29, S\u00e1m\u00e1l], the son of R\u00e1kha'tam [D. \u0631\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0646 = Rehoboam], called by the Persians Ummidh-dukht, who was one of the Jews whom Bukht-Nus\u1e63ar (Nebuchadnezzar) led away captive.\u2014Her brother R\u00fayn\u00e1l [D.

Abi Karib, with Arabic verses engraved on an ebony throne therein (f. 47a).\u2014Account of the Tubba' al-Aqran (f. 47b).\n\nThe Persian Legend from Bahman to Alexander.\n\nBahman has a son S\u00e1s\u00e1n and a daughter Khum\u00e1n\u00ed. The latter, after the incestuous custom of the Magians [called Khev\u00e9t\u00e1k-das], he takes to wife. When at the point of death (having then reigned eighty years), he causes her to be crowned, and bids her act as regent, but, if she bear a son, surrender the power into his hands when he has reached years of discretion. She bears a son, D\u00e1r\u00e1, and abdicates in his favour when he is 30 years old. Her brother S\u00e1s\u00e1n, greatly vexed at his exclusion from the Crown, betakes himself to the Kurds in the mountains and becomes\na shepherd, whence he is called \"S\u00e1s\u00e1n the Kurd\" and \"S\u00e1s\u00e1n the Shepherd.\" Khum\u00e1n\u00ed invades R\u00fam, and compels two architects whom she takes captive to build for her three palaces in F\u00e1ra\u2014one in Ist\u00e1kh, one on the road thence to Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, and the third two parasangs along the road to D\u00e1r\u00e1bjird. Legend said to have been read on one of her coins [see J.R.A.S. for January, 1899, p. 52]. On the coronation of D\u00e1r\u00e1 his mother Khum\u00e1n\u00ed takes the veil and retires into private life (f. 48b).\n\nThe above portion of the narrative corresponds very closely with D\u00ednawar\u00ed (pp. 29\u201330), and is given on the authority of Ibnul-Muqaffa', who is cited three or four times, but the coin-legend is apparently not ascribed to this source. At this point there is a transition to the history of Yaman, and the legend of Dh\u00fa Jaysh\u00e1n, T\u00e1sm, and Judays, wherein occurs an episode presenting a striking analogy (to which attention has been called by Baron Carra de Vaux) with the coming of Birnam Wood to Dunsinane in \"Macbeth.\" This is followed (f. 51b) by an account of the sepulchre of Dh\u00fa Jaysh\u00e1n, who was defeated by D\u00e1r\u00e1, to whom the narrative now returns.\n\nElated with pride at his victory over Dh\u00fa Jaysh\u00e1n, D\u00e1r\u00e1 invades R\u00fam with 100,000 men, defeats Philip of Macedon [Fil\u00edfus, Fil\u00edfus, in D., p. 41, al-Fayl\u00edfus, for the less correct Fil\u00e1g\u00fas of Nidh\u00e1mi and other Persian writers] in Syria, and exacts from him a yearly tribute of 1,000 [D. 100,000] nuggets of gold each weighing 40 mithq\u00e1ls, which tribute was paid till the death of D\u00e1r\u00e1 I and the accession to the throne of his son D\u00e1r\u00e1 II.\n\nAt this point (f. 52a) the narrative again turns to Yaman, and recounts the bursting of the dam of al-'Ir\u00e1m, etc., after which we come to the Legend of Alexander, which is given at great length and occupies ff. 56a\u201379a. First come the Persian and Greek accounts of his parentage, and the Persian popular etymology of his name, the plant after which he is called being here designated Iskandar [D. \u00c1l sandar]. This corresponds very closely with D. 32\u201334, but the dialogue between Aristotle and Alexander [merely\ndescribed by D. as \"a long harangue,\" p. 33] is here given more fully, as well as several miraculous circumstances connected with the liberation of Aristotle from prison by an angel, the destruction, by fire from heaven, of the soldiers who try to recapture him, and the final conversion of Alexander. The war between him and D\u00e1r\u00e1, as well as the negotiations which preceded it, are described much more fully than in D. 34. D\u00e1r\u00e1 sends five ambassadors to Alexander (f. 59b) with a second letter, and also, \"to prove his understanding,\" the following objects: a golden box or coffin, a precious pearl, a polo bat and ball, and a stocking filled with sesame or coriander-seed. Alexander interprets the pearl as the kingdom of D\u00e1r\u00e1, \"which shall become wholly mine, even as this pearl lies in the hollow of my hand\"; the golden box as D\u00e1r\u00e1's treasure; the bat and ball as himself and D\u00e1r\u00e1, \"whom I will drive before me as the ball is driven by the bat\"; and the stocking full of sesame as the Persian hosts, \"whom,\" said he, placing some of the seed in his mouth, \"I will grind to powder even as I crush this in my mouth.\" He then loads D\u00e1r\u00e1's envoys with presents, and gives them a bag of mustard-seed for the Persian king, who tries to treat it as Alexander treated the millet, with what results may be readily imagined. The narrative now runs very close to that of the Sh\u00e1hnama (ed. Macan, vol. iii, pp. 1269 et seqq.), and is much fuller than D.; but it differs from the latter in not making Alexander the instigator of D\u00e1r\u00e1's assassination, in adding an ornate harangue delivered by D\u00e1r\u00e1 to his troops (f. 60), and in mentioning several persons (D\u00e1r\u00e1's minister Mah-\u00e1dh\u00e1r, his brother Mard\u00e1\u00e1n-bih) and places (J\u00fay-bih near Kaskar) not there mentioned. The account of D\u00e1r\u00e1's death and last wishes, the punishment of his murderers, and Alexander's marriage with his daughter Rawshanak (Roxana) are much the same as in D.\n\nThe remainder of the Alexander legend, which is less intimately connected with Persia, agrees very closely with the Sh\u00e1hnama (iii, pp. 1304\u20131359), both in matter and arrangement, and less closely with D\u00ednawari, who omits\nseveral episodes, such as Alexander's visit to the holy men called here \u0628\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0646\u064a\u0648\u0646, but by Firdaws\u00ed (Sh., pp. 1327\u20131331) \"Brahmins.\" The description of them and their city, here called \u0645\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a, closely agrees with Qazw\u00edni's account of J\u00e1balq and J\u00e1bars in the Ath\u00e1ru'l-Bil\u00e1d (pp. 17\u201318). These holy men, questioned by Alexander, foretell the course of history down to the time of Isl\u00e1m (ff. 68b\u201370b). Next comes the account of the people described by D. (p. 39, ll. 15\u201318), who are here placed under a queen named \u0628\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0633; then Alexander's journey to the West, the city of J\u00e1bars, the boiling Fountain wherein the sun sets, and the Land of Darkness; the colloquy with the gigantic birds and with Isr\u00e1f\u00edl the Angel (Sh\u00e1hn\u00e1ma, iii, pp. 1340\u20131341). For what follows not Ibru'l-Muqaffa' but ash-Sha'b\u00ed', on the authority of 'Abdu's-Sul\u00e1m, is cited. This includes Alexander's quest with Khidr after the Water of Life, to which he is incited by his Guardian Angel \u0632\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0628\u06cc\u0644, wherein Isr\u00e1f\u00edl and the gigantic birds are again introduced; the building of the cities \u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e\u06cc\u0647 [D. 38, \u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e\u06cc\u0647] and \u0633\u0648\u0631\u06cc\u0647, here regarded as successive names of one town, not (as in D.) as two separate places; the journey through the lands of the Slavs, Khazars, and Turks to China, and the submission of its Emperor [= D. 38]. Then follow a number of marvels omitted by D., such as the destruction of Alexander's minister \u0623\u0646\u064a\u0644\u0648\u0645\u0648\u0646 (? Philemon) and a thousand of his men by a sea-monster; the Image of K\u00fas the son of Fer\u00edd\u00fan; J\u00e1bars and J\u00e1balq; the talking trees; the Dragon slain by cow-shaped automata; the dead King of '\u00c1d on the mountain spur; the dialogue of Alexander with the Angel who sustains the mountain, who gives him the title Dhu'l-Qarnayn and much good counsel; the horse-headed folk who speak the language of \"the Blacks,\" etc. The remaining episodes \u2014 viz., Gog and Magog, and the Great Wall; Alexander's return to Persia, Syria, and Jerusalem; the twelve cities built by him; his discussion with Aristotle as to the best means for securing peace to his country after his death, and the institution of the Mul\u00edku't-Taw\u00e1'd\u00edf or \"Tribal Kings\" (= Sh., iii, p. 1354); and Alexander's\ndeath and burial\u2014occur also in D. (pp. 39\u201341), though in a more meagre form. The *Nihayat*, for example, places the capitals of the Persian \"Tribal Kings\" at Mahin, Saymara, Masbadhan, Nahavand, and Mihrzafadan; mentions the appointment of \u0645\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0645 (also later in the book \u0647\u0631\u0645\u0633: cf. N\u00f6ldeke's *Sasaniden*, p. 1, \"Mihrmas?\"), the grandsire of Ardashir Babakan, as king of Istakhri; and gives what purport to be inscriptions, letters, and funeral orations (= Sh., iii, p. 1359) in abundance. The forms of the many foreign names mentioned in the Alexander legend vary considerably in the *Nihayat* (N.), *Dinawari* (D.), and Macan's ed. of the *Shahnama* (Sh.), for instance: \u0646\u06cc\u0648\u06cc\u0648\u0646 N. = \u062a\u06cc\u067e\u0644\u0648\u06cc\u0646 Sh. 1310\u20131312; \u0642\u06cc\u062f\u0627\u062f\u0647 N. = \u0642\u06cc\u062f\u0627\u062f\u0647 Sh. 1312\u20131327; \u0634\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646 = \u0634\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646 D.; \u0642\u06cc\u062f\u0627\u062f\u0647\u060c \u062a\u06cc\u0634\u0627\u062f\u0647 = \u0642\u06cc\u062f\u0627\u062f\u0647\u060c \u062a\u06cc\u0634\u0627\u062f\u0647 D.; \u062a\u06cc\u067e\u0644\u0648\u06cc\u0646 = \u062a\u06cc\u067e\u0644\u0648\u06cc\u0646 Sh.; \u06a9\u06cc\u0628\u0631 N. = \u06a9\u06cc\u0628\u0631 Sh.; \u062a\u0627\u0641\u0648\u0646\u06cc = \u062a\u0627\u0641\u0648\u0646\u06cc D.; \u0628\u0631\u062c\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u06cc = \u0628\u0631\u062c\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u06cc Sh.; \u0637\u06cc\u0628\u0648\u0634 = \u0637\u06cc\u0628\u0648\u0634 D.; \u0646\u0627\u0631\u0633 = \u0646\u0627\u0631\u0633 D.; \u062a\u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0633 = \u062a\u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0633 D.; \u0645\u0631\u062c\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0633 = \u0645\u0631\u062c\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0633 D.; \u0635\u062f\u0631 = \u0635\u062f\u0631 N. = \u0641\u0631\u06cc\u0628\u0647 D., etc.\n\n*From the Death of Alexander to the Rise of the Sasanian Dynasty.*\n\nWe now come to the period of the *Mulukut-Tawd'if*, or \"Tribal Kings,\" of which the events are so scantily represented in the national tradition that they hardly fill one page of Macan's edition of the *Shahnama*. The length of this period, between the death of Alexander and the establishment of the Sasanian dynasty, is represented here, as in nearly all Arabic and Persian sources, as 266 years instead of about 550, which was its actual duration. The reason of this false chronology is explained by the learned Mas'udi in his *Kitabu't-tanbih wa'l-ishraf* (ed. De Goeje, pp. 97\u201398). When Ardashir Babakan, says he, had overthrown Ardavan the Parthian, and established himself as sole\nruler of Persia, a prophecy was current that 1,000 years after Zoroaster the religion founded by him and the Persian Empire would fall together. Now Zoroaster is placed by Oriental historians about 280 or 300 years before Alexander, since whose time 550 years more had elapsed, and therefore only about 150 years of the thousand were still left; so Ardashir, fearing, probably, that the prophecy might conduce to its own fulfilment, deliberately cut off some three centuries from this period, thus extending the prophesied duration of his dynasty 434 years, the approximate time (A.D. 226\u2013652) of its actual duration. This falsification of the records Mas'udi calls \"an ecclesiastical and political secret of the Persians.\" The story is a curious one, as apparently ascribing efficacy to what is recognized as a forged prophecy.\n\nTo return, however, to the Nih\u00e1yat. To what D. (p. 41, II. 10\u201315) says about the method of settling disputes employed by the \"Tribal Kings\" it adds (f. 79a) that they were eager after wisdom and culture, and that in their time were written the Books of Kalila and Dimna, Sindbdad, S\u00e1h\u00edb, S\u00e1h\u00edb, Y\u00fasf\u00e1\u0161 (\u064a\u0648\u0633\u0641), Bal\u00fahar (\u0628\u0639\u0644\u0647\u0627\u0631), and Apollonius (\u0623\u0628\u0648\u0644\u064a\u0646\u0648\u0633). \"That is to say,\" adds the author, \"in the name of Apollonius (Apollonius or Pliny), the expert in columns.\" After a brief mention of the coming of Christ [D. I., II. 19\u201320] and the reign of Ardaw\u00e1n b. Asha [D. 43, II. 12\u201319], there follows, on the authority of \u1e62am\u016bl-Muqatta', the episode of B\u00fad\u00e1saf, an appearance of the Buddha legend, wanting in D., of which the summary runs as follows (f. 79b\u201386b):\n\n---\n\n**Episode of B\u00fad\u00e1saf (Buddha).**\n\nKing Ardaw\u00e1n b. Asha b. S\u00e1b\u00far b. Ardaw\u00e1n, being childless, prays for a son. His prayer is answered by the birth of B\u00fad\u00e1saf. As this prince increases in age he is filled with sadness at the transitoriness of all worldly things and the misery which prevails in the world, and he resolves to withdraw from public life and become a hermit.\nHe questions and argues with his father, who bids him publicly discuss his proposal with the people, appointing the monk Sham'un (Simeon) arbiter. The King first addresses the assembly, telling them that \"there has befallen them what befell the bird Shirm\u00e1\" (\u0634\u06cc\u0631\u0645). The Prince retorts with the Story of the Partridge (\u0635\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0651\u0627\u0631), which is met on the part of the people by the Story of the Gazelle called \u0627\u0650\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0627. After the relation of these and other fables the Prince is finally permitted to depart and adopt the ascetic life. He retires to a mountain in 'Ir\u0101q on the confines of Ahw\u00e1z called \u0645\u064e\u0647\u0652\u062f\u064e\u0641 (perhaps a corruption of \u0645\u064e\u0647\u0652\u062f\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0629, Mihrd\u0101n-gadhaq, D. 42, l. 14). The King of Ahw\u00e1z and his beautiful daughter come to spend the summer in a castle situated near this mountain. One day the King chances on Prince B\u016bd\u0101saf and holds with him a discussion, in which the Parable of the three men in the Garden is introduced. The Princess, hearing of B\u016bd\u0101saf, desires to join him in his ascetic life, and confides in her old nurse, who devises a plan to bring about their marriage. The old nurse holds a discussion with B\u016bd\u0101saf, in which are introduced other parables of birds, etc. B\u016bd\u0101saf is finally induced to marry the Princess, who joins him in his life of pure devotion. Meanwhile Farrukh\u00e1n dies, and his people seek out B\u016bd\u0101saf and endeavour to persuade him to rule over them in place of his father. Another discussion follows, in which another pious hermit is appointed arbiter. B\u016bd\u0101saf is eventually persuaded to consent to his people's wish and accept the crown. Advice of the old nurse to the Princess, and of her three sisters. A son is born to B\u016bd\u0101saf and his wife in their old age, who is Ardaw\u00e1n (\u0100dharw\u00e1n), the last Parthian king, whom Ardash\u012br B\u0101bak\u0101n overthrew. This legend, evidently of Indian origin, and belonging to the Buddha and Barlaam-Josaphat cycle of stories, presents a close analogy with the Story of Bal\u0101sh the S\u0101s\u0101nian, the Indian Princess, and the groom's daughter, published with a Russian translation by Baron Rosen in the Vostochniya Zamyetki (pp. 153-165), and given further on in the Nih\u0101y\u0101t (ff. 135b-142b).\nWe now enter on the Sasanian period, which, with the corresponding Arabian history, occupies the remainder of the volume (ff. 89a\u2013230b). In order to keep this article within reasonable limits I shall as far as possible ignore what concerns only the Arabs, and shall, moreover, take D\u012bnawari\u2019s account of the Sasanian kings (pp. 44\u2013149) as my basis, noting only such passages of the Nih\u0101yat as are omitted from his history or occur in a different form. These matters I shall arrange under the names of the successive kings of the House of Sasan, adding the date of each king (taken from N\u00f6ldeke) and the portions of D\u012bnawari (D.) and the Nih\u0101yat (N.) which deal with his reign. N\u00f6ldeke\u2019s Sasaniden (transl. of Tabari) is cited as T.\n\nI. Ardashir B\u0101bak\u0101n (A.D. 226\u2013241: N. 89\u2013101; D. 44\u201348).\n\nOn the death of B\u0101bak, King of Istakhr, his son Ardashir is chosen to succeed him.\u2014His brothers are jealous and revolt, but while marching against him are destroyed by the collapse of Khum\u0101ni\u2019s palace (see p. 212, supra), situated four parasangs from Istakhr, in which they have alighted for the night [T. 8].\u2014Ardashir\u2019s dream [= T. 6].\u2014His harangue to his people.\u2014He takes D\u0101r\u0101bjird.\u2014Slays [probably = Gochihr, \u062c\u064e\u0632\u0652\u0631 : see T. 4 and n. 4 ad calc.], king of \u062c\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0628\u0650\u0644\u064e, and appoints N\u0101rsi [\u0646\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0631\u0650 = Tir\u00ea of T. 4\u20135] governor of his territory.\u2014The kings of F\u0101rs thereon complain of Ardashir\u2019s aggressions to Ardaw\u0101n, who writes a letter of remonstrance.\u2014Ardashir writes a circular letter to the kings, including Ardaw\u0101n, who is furious [D. 44] and sends a second letter, to which also he receives no reply.\u2014Ardashir conquers Sh\u0101pur and Isfah\u0101n, defeats and slays Ardaw\u0101n in the plain of B\u0101darj\u0101n [D. 44, Hurmuzdj\u0101n] at the end of the month of Mihr [so D.], seizes Nab\u0101vand, and takes to wife a cousin of Ardaw\u0101n [D. 45 makes her a niece of Ardaw\u0101n\u2019s son Farrukh\u0101n, who is represented in this account as the last Parthian king; T. 27 merely describes her as of the family of Ashak, i.e. one of the Arsacides], not knowing that she belongs to the family\nof his dead foe. This leads up to the well-known story of Abars\u00e1m [here described as \u064a\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0646\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0647\u064f\u0648\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0650: cf. T. 9 and n. 1; 27, n. 2] and the birth, concealment, and recognition of Sh\u00e1pur [here, as in T. 28, Sh\u00e1h-puhar, \u0634\u0627\u0647 \u067e\u0647\u0631\u0648 \u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645\u0629... \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u06a9], from which, however, it is separated by an account of Ardashir's further conquests of Ahw\u00e1z, Hamad\u00e1n, Qum, Ray, Dashni, Merv, Adharbayj\u00e1n, and Armenia; his defeat of the seventeen allied kings under Mibrak, the son of F\u00e1dh\u00e1n, King of Babylon, Khu\u1e6darniya, and S\u00far\u00e1, and his son Sh\u00e1dh-mihr [cf. T. 11 and n. 2, and 43 seqq.]; his assumption of the title Sh\u00e1hinsh\u00e1h [D. 45, l. 17]; and his restoration of al-Mad\u00e1'in (originally built by \u0632\u0627\u0628 \u0628\u0646 \u0645\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f).\n\nSo far the narrative contains hardly any new elements; what remains (ff. 93b\u2014101b) is of a less familiar and more legendary character. It is related that Christ (placed by a gross anachronism in this period, although previously mentioned in the Parthian time) sent one of his disciples to Ardashir [D. 46], who was well received by his Minister on the recommendation of his son. Ardashir's favourite horse falls sick and dies, but is restored to life by this disciple in his Master's name, whereupon Ardashir, his son Sh\u00e1pur, and his Minister embrace the Christian religion [cf. D. 85], and endeavour to persuade the Persian nobles to do the same. In this attempt, however, Ardashir is unsuccessful, and is compelled thereafter to conceal his belief for fear of being deposed. The parallel which this legend offers to the healing of King Gusht\u00e1sp's favourite horse by Zoroaster is so obvious that we can hardly doubt that we have here one of those transferences noted by N\u00f6ldeke (Das iranische Nationalepos, pp. 3, 4, and note ad calc.).\n\nThe institutions of Ardashir are next discussed, viz.: how he organized the kingdom; how he chose his knights (\u0627\u0633\u0627\u0648\u0631); how he chose his secretaries; how he guarded his frontiers; how he received ambassadors; how he built cities; how he dealt with the Noble Houses (\u067e\u06cc\u0648\u0646\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0641), the members\nof which are the B\u00e1r-b\u00edt\u00e1n of the Pahlav\u00ed inscriptions); how he caused the land to prosper; how he instituted the five classes or castes (of priests, warriors, scribes and poets, farmers, and merchants), causing each to wear a distinctive mark; and how he devised a means whereby all who thought themselves wronged could be sure of submitting to him personally their appeal. This last institution is described in exactly similar terms in the Siy\u00e1sat-n\u00e1ma (ed. Sch\u00e9fer, p. 10; transl., pp. 12-13), which is interesting, as revealing a common source for both books which cannot be placed later than the eleventh century of our era.\n\nFinally, we have the account of Ardashir's death after a reign of 40 years and 10 months (sic!); his dying injunctions to his son Sh\u00e1pur, which include a prophecy of the fall of the dynasty after 600 years (sic!); and the names of the six cities founded by him, which, though corrupted in several cases, agree on the whole with D. 47, and less closely with the eight cities in T. 19-20.\n\n2. Sh\u00e1pur I (A.D. 241-272: N. 102b-104a; D. 48-49).\n\nThe accounts of this reign are scanty in both N. and D., but the agreement is close. N., after its usual fashion, gives the speech made by Sh\u00e1pur on his accession. The story of the building of Bel-\u00e1b\u00e1d [Beth L\u00e1p\u00e1t: see T. 40-41], omitted by D., is here given. The name of Valerianus [T. 32 and n. 3 ad calc.] here occurs as \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0650\u0634\u064f\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0650\u0634\u064f\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0650\u0634\u064f\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0650\u0634\u064f.

Bahr\u00e1m II is here stated to have conceived a dislike to the Zoroastrian religion because of the incestuous marriages sanctioned by it, and to have sent to India for Christian teachers. Seven missionaries are sent. He becomes a Christian, attempts to convert his people, is threatened with deposition, and conceals his faith (cf. Ardash\u00edr, p. 219, supra).\n\n7, 8. N\u00e1rsi and Hurmu\u017e II (A.D. 293\u2013309; N. 108b; D. 49).\n\n9.

D. 51, note d) and peace with Jovian (here \u064a\u0648\u0633\u064a\u0648\u0633: cf. D. 52, note e); and the cession of Ni\u0161ibin to the Persians and its colonization by 12,000 of them from Istakhr, to which N. adds \"4,000 from Isfah\u00e1n.\" The only additions in N. are Sh\u00e1pur's title Sh\u00e1h-i-jah\u00e1n = Rabbu'd-duny\u00e1 (cf. p. 201, supra), a translation of a short harangue alleged to have been delivered by him to his people \"in Persian\" in the fifth year of his reign, and a few trivial amplifications of the Roman War. The narrative of his reign is followed by a long account of Jirj\u00eds the Christian saint, filled with miracles and marvels, and by the story of Judayma and Hind az-Zabb\u00e1, which\noffers a remarkable parallel to the Zopyrus legend. This story is alluded to in D. 56 as well-known, but is not there given.\n\n10, 11, 12. Ardashir II, Sh\u00e1pur III, Bahr\u00e1m IV (A.D. 379-399; N. 120-121; D. 53).\n\nOf these three kings the first is entirely omitted both by N. and D., while the accounts of the others are very meagre. Except for the throne-speeches of each, and the substitution of twenty for thirteen years in the reign of the latter, N. is practically identical with D.\n\n13, 14. Yazdigird I, Bahr\u00e1m V G\u00far (A.D. 399-438; N. 1225-1296; D. 53-60).\n\nThe Persian original of Yazdigird's title al-Athim is given as Rasa-kun (cf. p. 202, supra), and the usual throne-speech is ascribed to him. His faults are summed up as a fondness for conferring titles on unworthy persons, arrogance, contempt for learning and religion and systematic opposition to their professors, and extreme wilfulness. The birth of his son Bahr\u00e1m G\u00far is placed in the second year of his reign, on the day of Hurmuzd in the month of Farvard\u00edn. When Mundhir is summoned to receive and take charge of the child, Yazdigird confers on him twofold promotion and the titles Ahd Khurrahi and Mastar\u00e1 Mastar\u00e1 (cf. 193a):\n\n[These titles are given by T. (pp. 86-87) as R\u00e1m-arz\u00fadh L\u00e1v\u00e1sh and M\u00e1t\u00e1sh.] The account of Bahr\u00e1m's training is a little fuller than in D. He studies with three Persian and three Arabic tutors (D. 53 says \"two\" in each case).\nfor seven years, till he reaches the age of 12, when he devotes himself to horsemanship and archery. As he grows older he persuades Mundhir to give him four concubines and five of his best horses. One of the former named Az\u00e1dwar accompanies him to the chase, and he, at her request, to display his skill in archery, shoots at a gazelle which is scratching its ear and pins the ear to the foot, but afterwards discards Az\u00e1dwar because she has imposed on him such a test.\u2014His skill as a hunter.\u2014His encounter with a lion.\u2014He visits his father Yazdigird at Ctesiphon, but wearies of his life there and returns to Mundhir.\u2014Yazdigird is killed by the demon-horse [T. 77\u201378 and note] when he has reigned 21\u00bd years [= D. 57].\n\nThe proposal to exclude Bahr\u00e1m from the throne and the setting up in his place of a descendant of Ardashir B\u00e1bak\u00e1n stand in N. as in D., but the names of the conspirators are here omitted.\u2014Bahr\u00e1m, with Mundhir and a thousand Arabs, marches on Ctesiphon, and is joined by 12,000 men. The Persians, being alarmed, send a pious man named Juw\u00e1n-bih [T. \"Juw\u00e1n\u0113\u014d\u0113\"] to Bahr\u00e1m, who proposes that he and his rival Ardashir shall decide their claims by the ordeal of the lion. This proposal is accepted, and Bahr\u00e1m is victorious [T. 91\u201398; D. om.]. He is made king, pardons those who would have excluded him, and issues a proclamation.\n\nThe next incident is the war with the Kh\u00e1q\u00e1n of the Turks, which is told exactly as in D. 57\u201359 save in the following details. The Kh\u00e1q\u00e1n is at Q\u00famis when the Persians offer him submission and tribute, thinking that Bahr\u00e1m has fled from his foe. Bahr\u00e1m thereupon doubles back from Adharbayj\u00e1n, whither he has gone, by Daylam and Tabarist\u00e1n, to Q\u00famis, occupies a mountain near the Kh\u00e1q\u00e1n's encampment, and about dawn lets loose on the Turkish camp all the beasts and birds he has captured, as well as his dogs and falcons, so that the Turks, thinking themselves to be attacked by an immense host of at least a million men, flee in panic. Bahr\u00e1m pursues them, kills the Kh\u00e1q\u00e1n, invades their country, delimits the frontier, and\nHis proclamation\u2014His generosity to his army and subjects.\u2014He makes an announcement as to how long he will reign.\n\nThe actual duration was 31 years (its actual duration), but he made it appear as if it were 29 but 3 x 20, i.e. 60 years. He died in the quagmire at D\u00e1y\n\n(See also Z. M. T. 103 and n. 3).\n\nThe account of the life of Piruz (A.D. 438-484):\n\nPiruz was the son of Arvand. His name is even shorter than his father's, and he was mentioned in connection with a struggle between his brothers.\n\nIn the year 457, Khusrau took the place of his father, who was given to him by the king (he had \"30,000\" men), and he was assassinated by Khosrau, which is the same as Piruz. Also Piruz,\n\nThe account of the disastrous campaign of his father and the release of his son by Sukhr\u00e1\n\n(See also Z. M. T. 103 and n. 3 of note).\n\nThe city founded by Piruz is mentioned, and it is called \"Piruz.\"\n\nThere is a throne-speech.\n18. Bal\u00e1sh (A.D. 484\u2013488; N. 135b\u2013142b; D. 62).\n\nHere, as already noted (pp. 200\u2013201, supra), we have an important addition, viz. the Story of Bal\u00e1sh with the Indian Princess and the Groom's Daughter, published, with a Russian translation, by Baron Rosen in his contribution to the Vostochniya Zamy\u00e9tki, pp. 153\u2013165. As D. gives nothing about Bal\u00e1sh save the fact that he reigned four years, I here add a brief abstract of this portion of the Nih\u00e1y\u00e1t. Bal\u00e1sh's accession at the age of 20, and throne-speech.\u2014His fondness for women. He hears of the beauty of Harv\u00e1la, daughter of the King of India, and asks her in marriage.\u2014Her father urges her to consent.\u2014She relates the Story of the Owner of the Pearl, and refuses Bal\u00e1sh.\u2014He invades India, kills the Indian king in single combat, and summons the Princess before him.\u2014She relates to him the Story of the Diver and the Pearl.\u2014He brings her back to Persia, houses her magnificently, obtains, after a while, her permission to visit her, and remains with her seven days.\u2014His subsequent neglect.\u2014She sends her nurse to ascertain its cause, and learns the ascendancy obtained over him by the Groom's Daughter.\u2014The Princess makes friends with her, finds out how she has succeeded in winning and retaining the King's affection, induces him to visit her again, and succeeds in completely captivating him.\u2014He consents to remain with her three days.\u2014She relates to him on the first day the Story of the King and the Beautiful Tree.\u2014Her discourse on the different kinds of beauty.\u2014She relates to him the Story of the Lion, the Lioness, and the Hyaena.\u2014On the third day a servant brings an insulting message to the Princess from the Groom's Daughter.\u2014The King, moved by the Princess's tears, gives her the Groom's Daughter, whom she at once sends for.\u2014The Groom's Daughter arrives, argues with the Princess, and remonstrates with the King and relates to him the Story of the Fox and the Birds.\u2014The Princess retorts with the Story of the Crow and the Pigeon, which the Groom's Daughter meets with the Story of the Rat, the\nLark, and the \u062d\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0627\u062f\u064c.\u2014Continuation of the discussion.\u2014The Groom\u2019s Daughter poisons herself.

T. 456) instead of \u201cfrom I\u1e63\u1e6dakhr\u201d [D. 67], and is said to have been supported by a Persian noble named \ufe91\ufee6 \ufea7\ufeae\u0627\u06a9\ufe8e\u0646\u2014no doubt a corruption of Zar\u00e1tusht son of Khurag\u00e1n [cf. T. 456].\u2014Qub\u00e1dh only pretends to believe in Mazdak, but his pretence is taken for reality, and he is deposed in favour of his brother J\u00e1masp and imprisoned.\u2014His release and flight with Zarm\u00edlhr, son of Sukhr\u00e1, and four other companions; his marriage at a farm between Ahw\u00e1z and Isfah\u00e1n with the mother of N\u00edsh\u00edrw\u00e1n, and his further adventures, agree with D. 67 et seqq., but the incident of the gold-embroidered trousers [omitted by D., but mentioned in T. 136] occurs. The course of his further flight to the Kh\u00e1q\u00e1n is by Her\u00e1t, B\u00fashanj (\u0628\u064f\u0634\u0627\u0646\u062c), and Gil\u00e1n.\u2014In the conditions laid down by the Kh\u00e1q\u00e1n, T\u00e1laq\u00e1n takes the place of S\u00edgh\u00e1n\u00edy\u00e1n. Cf. p. 224, supra, s.v. P\u00edr\u00faz, where the same data (including the 30,000 men furnished by the Kh\u00e1q\u00e1n) occur in another connection.\u2014Qub\u00e1dh\u2019s conquests\nin the land of R\u00fam, and the cities founded by him, are here given nearly as in D. 68, except that A'mad-Qub\u00e1dh stands for Abar-Qub\u00e1dh. Next follows in D. 69 the account of N\u00fash\u00edrw\u00e1n's character, and his one fault of being oversuspicious, for which his father takes him to task. In N. (144b\u2013145b) this is amplified. This Prince's good qualities are first enumerated. His father sets a watch over him to ascertain more fully his character, that he may see whether he is fit for the succession. The qualities particularly regarded by the Persians as essential to a king were, wisdom, self-control when angered, truthfulness and loyalty, generosity, modesty, a cheerful demeanour, and unwillingness to think evil. Of these seven attributes N\u00fash\u00edrw\u00e1n is defective only in the last.\u2014Qub\u00e1dh's counsels to N\u00fash\u00edrw\u00e1n.\u2014The testament which he leaves to be opened and read to his son by the M\u00e1b\u00e1d\u00e1n-m\u00e1b\u00e1dh (explained as \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0635\u0651\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0628\u0627\u062f\u0631\u0629) after his death.\u2014This is done.\n\n20. Khusrau I N\u00fash\u00edrw\u00e1n (A.D. 531\u2013578: N. 146\u2013167; D. 69\u201376).\n\nAfter the reading of the testament above mentioned, N\u00fash\u00edrw\u00e1n makes the usual throne-speech.\u2014He beheads Mazdak and his followers.\u2014Divides Persia into four provinces, nearly as in D. 69, but here Kirm\u00e1n is placed in the third instead of the first.\u2014War with the Hay\u00e1t\u00edla.\u2014Defeat of \u015e\u00fal.\u2014The Khazars invade Armenia and \u00c1dharbayj\u00e1n, but are defeated and almost exterminated.\u2014N\u00fash\u00edrw\u00e1n builds a stone wall in Armenia to keep them out of his territories, and appoints one of his Marzub\u00e1ns with 12,000 cavalry to guard it. To this Warden of the Marches is accorded the privilege of sitting on a throne of gold. \"This,\" adds the author, \"is the place which is called B\u00e1bu'l-abw\u00e1b, and the dominion of this Marzub\u00e1n whom he set in this place as a guard remaineth unto his children until this day . . . . and these are they who are called [by the title of] 'King of the Throne'\" (Mahku'a-sarir).\u2014The portent of the jackals [= D. 76,\nStory of Raq\u012bqa, the daughter of Ab\u016b \u1e62ayf\u012b, who was born on the same day as \u2018Abdu\u2019l-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib.\u2014Next follows the Story of Sayf b. Dh\u016b Yazan [= D. 65\u201366]. He appeals first to the Byzantine Emperor at Constantinople [D. \u201cAntioch\u201d] for help against the Abyssinians.\u2014This the Emperor refuses, but offers him 10,000 dirhams, which, however, are declined. Sayf, introduced at the Persian Court by Nu\u2019m\u0101n ibn\u2019l-Mundhir, next addresses the same petition to N\u016bsh\u012brw\u0101n, adding to what is recorded by T. (220\u2013227) the following appeal on the ground of race and colour:\n\n[ Cf. T. 222, l. 15.] The remainder of the narrative of the Persian conquest of Yaman by Wahriz [cf. T. 223 and n. 2 ad calc.], here called Wahzan (perhaps a popular etymology, Wih-zan = Bih-zan, \u201cshooting well,\u201d in allusion to his lucky shot at Masr\u016bq, the Abyssinian king), differs from Tabari\u2019s account only in the following particulars. The condemned prisoners sent as an army with Wahriz, the centenarian, and Dh\u016b Yazan are raised in number from 800 to 3,600, and the ships in which they embark are reduced to seven. They are reinforced on their arrival by 20,000 Himyarites [T. 231, \u201c100,000\u201d]. Masr\u016bq\u2019s army is placed at 30,000 men. To the account of the lucky shot of Wahriz at the ruby on Masr\u016bq\u2019s forehead is added the passage concerning the choice of the arrow which I translated at pp. 52\u201353 of the J.R.A.S. for January, 1899. According to one of N\u00f6ldeke\u2019s notes [T. 226, n. 2], which I then overlooked, this also occurs in Ibn Qutayba\u2019s \u2018Uy\u016bn\u2019l-Akhb\u0101r (St. Petersburg MS.).

Nushirw\u00e1n falls ill at \u00c1mid (\u0623\u0645\u062f), not Hims.\u2014On An\u00fasha-z\u00e1d\u2019s escape from prison, he is said to have taken the other prisoners with him, and to have been gradually reinforced till he had 30,000 followers.\u2014Nushirw\u00e1n\u2019s instructions to the governor of Ctesiphon, addressed as the Dabir-badh (\u201cChief Scribe\u201d), are given in full. His contemptuous estimate of the Christians, because they are commanded, if smitten on one cheek, to turn the other, is identical with D. 72.\n\nNext follows the account of Nushirw\u00e1n\u2019s new fiscal system [D. 72\u201373; T. 241\u2013247] and military reforms [D. 74\u201375; T. 247\u2013249]. The former he proposes in a speech (f. 158b), in which he invites discussion, but an unfortunate secretary who ventures an objection is handed over to his colleagues and killed by them with their pen-knives [T. 242\u20133, and n. 2 on latter].\u2014The Minister of War, B\u00e1bak (P\u00e1pak), is here called \u201cthe son of Bir\u00fadh\u00e1n\u201d (\u061f \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0628\u064a\u0631\u0648\u062f\u0627\u0646) instead of D.\u2019s \u201cNahrun\u00e1n\u201d (D. 74) or T.\u2019s \u201cBiruc\u00e1n\u201d (T. 247).\u2014The platform erected for the king at the review is carpeted with . The story is otherwise the same as in D.\n\nThe names of the cities founded by Nushirw\u00e1n are evidently from the same source as D. 75, but the forms are slightly different in several cases, e.g. for we find ; for ; and for the well-known \u062c\u0633\u0631 \u0633\u0627\u067e\u0648\u0631\u060c \u062c\u0646\u062f\u0649 \u0633\u0627\u067e\u0648\u0631.\n\nSome personal traits and anecdotes of Nushirw\u00e1n next succeed. His leniency to his personal servants is illustrated by an anecdote describing how one day, being about to receive a deputation, he ordered an attendant to bring him\nhis crown. The man had been drinking, and his hand shook so that he let the crown fall, and it broke at the King's feet, yet he suppressed his anger and forgave him. Another similar instance is given in his gentle reproof of some of his courtiers who listened to the reading of a secret dispatch by his private secretary (f. 161a).\u2014His dislike of calumniators and traducers of other men, even when they spoke truly.\u2014His preference for public punishments of delinquents, as likely to produce greater effect.\u2014He bids his ministers intercede with him for criminals when his anger ran high, \"for,\" said he, \"I have heard from the doctors of our religion that the greatest reward is for such as show mercy to sinners.\"\u2014His love of learning and philosophy, his tender care of his subjects, his disregard of gossip and slander, his wise and deliberate discharge of business, especially in perilous affairs, and his clemency in all cases where it was possible, are also enumerated amongst his virtues.\n\nHere follow some further particulars about 'Abdu'l-Muttalib, the Persians in Yaman ('\u0627\u0644\u0622\u0646), B\u00e1dh\u00e1n the governor of that dependency, and the alleged Persian inscription found there (see pp. 202\u20133, supra). To these succeeds a long account (ff. 162b\u2013166b) of Buzurjm\u00edhr the son of Bakhtag\u00e1n, Bih-Sh\u00e1pur the chief priest (M\u00e1badh\u00e1n-m\u00fabah), and Yazd\u00edgi\u00fad the chief scribe, who, with seventy other wise men, were in constant attendance on the King.\u2014How Buzurjm\u00edhr first comes to the King's notice.\u2014Specimens of his philosophical aphorisms and wise sayings, filling several pages (ff. 162b\u2013166b).\u2014Ten aphorisms apiece from the three wise men above mentioned.\n\nN\u00fash\u00edrw\u00e1n is attacked by a mortal sickness when he has reigned forty-two years [D. 76 has \"forty-eight,\" which is correct]. He summons his children and family, and addresses to them a long exhortation (ff. 166b\u2013167b), with some additional words of counsel to his successor Hurmuzd.\n21. Hurmuzd IV (A.D. 578\u2013590: N. 167b\u2013178a; D. 77\u201391).\n\nThe usual throne-speech is in this case given also in D. 77\u201380, and the two versions correspond very closely, as they do in the account of his character, and the anecdote of his severity towards his son and successor, Khusraw Parviz, on account of a trespass which he had committed [T. 266]. This is followed by another similar anecdote. When he was riding out one day towards S\u0101b\u0101t, in the season of the grapes, one of his knights plucked a bunch of the fruit from a garden wall by the road. He was seen by the custodian of the garden, who threatened to report him to the King; and at this threat he was so terrified that he gave up his belt, of gold and silver ornamented with precious stones, to secure the man's silence [T. 267].\u2014His reply to the Herbeds who wished him to persecute the Christians [T. 268].\u2014The number of nobles and men of position whom he put to death for oppression of the poor is here given as 3,000 instead of the 13,600 of T. 268.\n\nWe now come to the troubles of the eleventh year of his reign, and the beginning of the long episode of Bahr\u0101m Ch\u016bbin [D. 81\u2013104: T. 270\u2013289 and 474\u2013478, where N\u00f6ldeke makes special mention of the Nih\u0101yat in this connection]. The Turkish invading army is here stated to have consisted of 300,000 men [so T. 269], and to have advanced to Balkh [D. Her\u0101t; T. Her\u0101t and B\u0101dg\u012bs]. The Byzantine army is reckoned at 100,000 men [T. 80,000]. Armenia is also attacked by the Khazars, and F\u0101rs [T. 270, Saw\u0101d] by the Arabs.\n\nConcerning the appointment of Bahr\u0101m Ch\u016bbin to lead the army against the Turks, N. adds the following additional particulars. After pacifying the Byzantines and driving off the Khazars, King Hurmuzd holds a council of war, where many conflicting opinions are advanced. Finally a Marzab\u0101n named An\u016bsha-j\u0101n (\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0634\u062c\u0627\u0646) advises that his aged father Mahr-bust\u0101n (\u0645\u0647\u0631\u0628\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646), who is an expert in\nTurkish politics, shall be summoned. This is done, and the old man relates in substance what follows. \"O King, thy father Kisr\u00e2 (N\u00fbsh\u00eerw\u00e2n) sent me with fifty attendants to the Kh\u00e2q\u00e2n, the King of the Turks, with a letter demanding one of his daughters in marriage, and commissioned me to select the daughter whom I deemed most suitable. He received us hospitably, and on the third day summoned me before him to see his daughters, the Kh\u00e2t\u00fbn, his queen, being also present. Now such of his daughters as were of humble origin on the mother's side were splendidly dressed and ornamented, but his daughter by the Queen was unadorned. But I detected their intention to mislead me in my choice, and chose her who was unadorned, and persisted in this, despite their endeavours to induce me to choose another. Then the Kh\u00e2q\u00e2n sent for one of his soothsayers named Kundugh (\u0645\u064f\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0641\u0650\u0639\u064e\u0629\u064c \u0643\u064e\u0646\u0652\u062f\u064e\u063a\u064d) and asked him his opinion. 'My opinion,' said he, 'is that thou shouldst give her in marriage to him, for she will hold a position of high honour, and will bear him a son of such-and-such attributes [set forth in detail] who will reign after his father, and whose glory shall be great.' And thou, O King, art he! Then the soothsayer continued: 'And there shall march against him from our country a king at the head of a vast host, who shall penetrate to the confines of his land; and the son of this girl shall send against him one of his captains with such-and-such attributes [set forth in detail], who will march against the king of our people and slay him and despoil his army. But the son of the king who was slain shall march out against him, and fight with him again, and scatter his host, and take him captive, and send him to the son of this girl.' So when the soothsayer had thus spoken, the King consented to my choice, and equipped his daughter and sent her with me; and she, O King, is thy mother.\"\n\nWhen King Hurmuzd had heard this narrative, he enquired of his courtiers, nobles, and captains whether they knew of any man possessing the attributes ascribed to the\ncaptain mentioned by the soothsayer. Then arose Yazd\u00e1n-Farr\u00fakh, the son of Abark\u00e1n (\u06cc\u0632\u062f\u0622\u0646 \u0641\u0631\u0648\u062e \u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0628\u0631\u06a9\u0627\u0646), and said, \"O King, these are the attributes of Bahr\u00e1m, the son of Bahr\u00e1m, thy warden of the marches of Armenia, who is entitled Ch\u00fab\u00edn.\"\n\nThereupon the King summoned Bahr\u00e1m Ch\u00fab\u00edn, received him in private audience, and told him the soothsayer's prediction. Bahr\u00e1m replied: \"O King, I am a servant amongst thy servants and a sword amongst thy swords, wherefore let the King send me against him . . . . and he shall find in me such strenuousness and such wisdom in counsel as the best which he hopeth of me, and such hurtfulness to the King's enemies as he hath been led to expect from me, so that I will utterly destroy them, and will accomplish my utmost endeavour in respect to them.\"\n\nThe King was delighted with Bahr\u00e1m, conferred on him the chief command, and gave him full choice of equipment. He chose 12,000 men, all over 50 [D. 82, \"40\"] years of age, and made Bahr\u00e1m, the son of Siy\u00e1wush\u00e1n, the Captain of his Guard; Yazd\u00e1n-Farr\u00fakh (here called \u00c1dh\u00e1n\u00ed-Farr\u00fakh), the son of Abark\u00e1n, the Master of his Horse; Mard\u00e1n-sh\u00edna, of Rawandasht, the Commander-in-Chief; Bund\u00e1d-Gushnasp, son of Jalh\u00e1n [\u0628\u0646\u0627\u062f \u062c\u0634\u0646\u0627\u0633 \u0628\u0646 \u062c\u0644\u062d\u0646], of Ray, the Head of his Intelligence Department; and another Bund\u00e1d [\u0628\u0646\u0627\u062f], Captain of the Vanguard. The King expresses his surprise at the force being so small comparatively, and composed of such elderly men. Bahr\u00e1m answers, citing several instances of armies of exactly this size obtaining great victories [D. 82], and explains his reason for choosing old instead of young men.\n\nNow when Bahr\u00e1m rode forth from the capital at a time fixed as fortunate by the astrologers, the King ordered the chief of those skilled in omens to go forth with him to see what omen would present itself. So Bahr\u00e1m marched out with his 1,500 men, and outside the gate there met him a naked man carrying a basket containing sheep's heads and\ntrotters; and Bahr\u00e1m picked out two of these heads with his spear and raised them aloft on his lance that all men might see, but one of them fell back into the basket. So the soothsayer went back and reported this to the King, interpreting it thus: \"The two heads of which one remained impaled on the spear and one fell back into the basket are two foes, of whom he will kill one, but will set the other free after he has taken him captive. And the naked man signifies that Bahr\u00e1m will cast off his allegiance to thee and will depose thee.\" So when the King heard this, he was troubled, and lay awake all that night, and next day consulted the M\u00fabadh\u00e1n-m\u00fabadh, who further discouraged the King, so that he sent a letter after Bahr\u00e1m bidding him return alone to receive a verbal communication. But Bahr\u00e1m excused himself and continued on his way, and the King let him go.\n\nWhen Bahr\u00e1m reached Ahw\u00e1z, an old woman complained to him that one of his troopers had stolen from her a basket of figs. So Bahr\u00e1m caused the trooper to be beheaded and his body crucified. He then advanced to Her\u00e1t, whence he turned aside into Gil\u00e1n (!) and proceeded by forced marches to Balkh, where the Turkish Kh\u00e1g\u00e1n [here called Sh\u00e1h\u00e1nsh\u00e1h: so D. 81, l. 11] was encamped. The account of the diplomacy by which Hurmuz Khurr\u00e1-ba-z\u00edn [D. (text) 83: \u062c\u0647\u0631\u0645 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0631\u0632\u0645\u0646] kept the Kh\u00e1g\u00e1n inactive, until, on Bahr\u00e1m's approach, he was able to join him, stands here as in D.; but the fight between the Persians under Bahr\u00e1m and the Turks under their King, as well as the preliminary operations, is here described with many details there wanting. These include Bahr\u00e1m's harangue to his troops; his placing fifty men in the rear of his army to slay any deserters; and the employment by the Turks in the battle of lions, elephants, and burning naphtha. The fight ends, as in D. 84, with the death of the Kh\u00e1g\u00e1n at Bahr\u00e1m's hands. Bahr\u00e1m Siy\u00e1wush\u00e1n is the only man\n\n---\n\n1 The form Jur\u00e1b-z\u00edn appears to be correct. Cf. N\u00f6ldeke's Sasaniden, p. 289, n. 1 ad eute.\nmissed on the Persian side, and he presently returns bringing a Turkish prisoner, who turns out to be the soothsayer consulted by the late Kh\u00e1q\u00e1n. He is beheaded by Bahr\u00e1m.\n\nThe attempt of the Kh\u00e1q\u00e1n's son, Yertagin or Yeltekin [here \u064a\u0631\u062a\u0646 for \u064a\u0631\u062a\u0646\u064a\u0646: cf. D. 84, T. 272 and n. 2], to avenge his father's death is given much as in D., but with details of the fighting and capitulation there omitted. He is sent a prisoner to King Hurmuzd with 7,000 of his followers, escorted by Mard\u00e1n-shina of Rawan-dasht and 3,000 Persian troops. After a month's captivity at the Persian capital they are restored to liberty, and the King proceeds to examine the spoils of war sent to him by Bahr\u00e1m Ch\u00fab\u00edn, against whom [as in D. 85] his suspicions are aroused by the remark of Yazd\u00e1n-Gushasp, \"How ample was the table whence came this morsel!\"\n\nThe King's insulting message to Bahr\u00e1m Ch\u00fab\u00edn, the anger of his companions at such ingratitude, their citation of the proverb \"Ardash\u00edr is no king and Abars\u00e1m [D. 85, \"Yazd\u00e1n\"] is no minister\" (explained in D., but not here), and the manner in which Bahr\u00e1m is goaded into rebellion, are described as in D., but rather more fully, and with the following additional incidents. Bahr\u00e1m goes forth to hunt with Mard\u00e1n-shina, Yazd\u00e1n-Gushasp, Hurmuzd Khurr\u00e1-ba-zin, and Yazdak [lower, \"Mazzak\"] the scribe. While pursuing a wild ass they lose their way in a wood, and come at last to a castle, where they seek hospitality. The others are entertained with food and drink while Bahr\u00e1m enters. As he is slow to return, Mard\u00e1n-shina goes to look for him, and finds him conversing with a very beautiful damsel, who is giving him advice on some subject which Mard\u00e1n-shina cannot understand. On seeing him, the girl bids him go out again and await his master. When these two eventually come out, and the girl bids Bahr\u00e1m God-speed, his companions refrain from questioning him; but that night Khurr\u00e1-ba-zin and Mazzak the scribe leave Bahr\u00e1m, flee to Mad\u00e1'in, and inform King Hurmuzd of Bahr\u00e1m's revolt, and of the girl, whom the Mabathd\u00edn-m\u00e1bath declares to be a fairy (\u062c\u0646\u062a\u06cc\u0647 \u062a\u0633\u0645\u06cc \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0630\u0647\u0628).\nthe cause of Bahr\u00e1m\u2019s disobedience. Bahr\u00e1m sends the King 12,000 knives, of which the points have been bent up; and the King, interpreting this as meaning that he and his 12,000 men have turned aside from their allegiance, answers him by sending them back with the points broken off.\n\nThe means adopted by Bahr\u00e1m Ch\u00fab\u00edn to arouse King Hurmuzd\u2019s suspicions against the loyalty of his son Parviz; the arrest of that Prince\u2019s uncles, Bist\u00e1m and Bind\u00e9\u00e9 (here called \u201cthe sons of Khursh\u00e9d-adarwih\u201d); the Prince\u2019s flight to Khdharbayj\u00e1n; the King\u2019s attempt to conciliate Bahr\u00e1m; and the murder of Yazd\u00e1n-Gushnasp (whose name sometimes occurs as \u064a\u0632\u062f\u06af\u0634\u06cc\u0633) at the hands of his cousin, agree closely with D.; but Yazd\u00e1n-Gushnasp\u2019s suspicions against his cousin are stated to have been evoked by a wise woman whom he consulted at Hamad\u00e1n as to the danger which he incurred by meeting Bahr\u00e1m. While he was talking with her, his cousin, whose release from prison he had asked of the King, happened to enter; and the wise woman on seeing him immediately exclaimed, \u201cWhat wouldst thou with all this questioning? For behold, thy fate is at the hands of him who approacheth!\u201d He believed her the more readily because astrologers had foretold at his birth that he would meet his death at the hands of a kinsman, and so resolved on the underhand device for compassing his cousin\u2019s death which cost him his own life.\n\nThe narrative now follows D. very closely as far as the escape of Parviz into Byzantine territory. The encounter between Parviz and the latter is here placed, however, at Jalil\u00e1 instead of Nahruw\u00e1n; the names of three of those who remained faithful to Parviz are here omitted; and the parley between the two parties is reported more fully, as well as the Prince\u2019s consultation with his deposed and imprisoned father. For comparison the following passage (f. 178a, II. 20-27), which differs more than usual from D. (92, II. 1-8), is given:\u2014\nOn arriving at Raqqa [D. 95, Yarmuk], in Byzantine territory, under the guidance of an Arab of the tribe of Tayy, Parviz and his nine remaining companions rest three days, and then push on through Syria. On the way Parviz holds a conversation with a monk, who tells him that the Byzantine Emperor will bestow on him in marriage his daughter Maryam and send his son Theodosius [\u062a\u064a\u0627\u062f\u0648\u0633] with 70,000 men to subdue the rebels, which will be effected in seventeen months and eighteen days; and that Parviz will rule for thirty-eight years. All this he professes to have discovered from an apocalypse of Daniel in his possession. Parviz then enquires as to his successor, and the monk answers:\n\n\u064a\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0628\u0646\u0643 \u0634\u0631\u0648\u064a\u0647 \u0623\u0634\u0647\u0631\u0627\u064b \u064a\u0633\u064a\u0631\u0627\u064b \u062b\u0645 \u064a\u0645\u0648\u062a \u062b\u0645 \u064a\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0628\u0646\u0647 \u0644\u0644\u0643 \u062a\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u062b\u0645 \u064a\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0628\u0639\u062f\u0647\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0644\u0645\u0639\u0649 \u0648\u0644\u0630\u0644\u0643 \u062b\u0645 \u064a\u062e\u0631\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0639\u0646\u0647 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0645\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0648\u0644\u062f \u0627\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0639\u064a\u0644 \u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0647\u064a\u0645 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u064a\u0633\u0643\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0648\u0627\u0630\u064a \u0637\u0639\u0627\u0645\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0647\u0648 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0645 \u0648\u0634\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0628 \u0641\u064a\u0628\u0642\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0641\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646\n\nThe monk makes further predictions, and adds that Bist\u00e1m will rebel against Parviz, whereupon the latter exacts from the former an oath that he will not do so.\nOn arriving at Antioch, Parv\u00edz sends five of his comrades, viz., Hurmuzd Khurr\u00e1-ba-z\u00edn, B\u00edst\u00e1m, Sh\u00e1p\u00far Abark\u00e1n, Yazdak the scribe, and another, as an embassy to the Emperor at Constantinople, with a letter of which the text is given. The Emperor receives them, promises his help, and dismisses them much comforted.\n\nThe next considerable addition to D.'s narrative (pp.96\u201399) occurs after the flight of Bahr\u00e1m Ch\u00fab\u00edn across the Oxus to seek the Kh\u00e1g\u00e1n's protection. The Byzantine Emperor sends a congratulatory message to Parv\u00edz, and a gift of gold and silver vessels and robes embroidered with crosses. These last are a source of great embarrassment to the Persian King, who fears that if he wears them he may be regarded by his people as an apostate from the Zoroastrian religion. Finally, at the advice of the Mubadh\u00e1n-m\u00fabadh, he decides to wear them for a single day to show his gratitude to the Emperor, and then to discard them. Clad in these robes, and accompanied by Theodosius, he enters the banqueting-hall. Some of his followers murmur at seeing him thus appalled, saying, \"He hath forsaken the Magian religion and become a Christian.\" Parv\u00edz, hearing this, wished to show that it was not as they supposed, so he, accompanied by Theodosius, approached the murmurers, . . . [Here something is omitted: apparently Parv\u00edz took some food or drink forbidden to Christians from one of his followers, and offered it to Theodosius, who] refused to touch it, out of respect for the garments ornamented with crosses which he wore, but took it from Parv\u00edz and handed it back to the \"murmurer\" (muzamzim). Thereat Bind\u00fa'\u00ed\u00e9 was angered and struck Theodosius, whereupon, notwithstanding the intervention of B\u00edst\u00e1m, a serious quarrel arose, and the Greek Prince demanded of Kisr\u00e1 either the surrender of Bind\u00fa'\u00ed\u00e9, that he might be beheaded, or a duel between the Greeks and Persians. Parv\u00edz, greatly embarrassed, consults his wife Maryam, who advises him to send Bind\u00fa'\u00ed\u00e9 to her brother Theodosius and trust to his forgiving disposition. This is done, Bind\u00fa'\u00ed\u00e9 is forgiven, and peace is restored. Parv\u00edz then bids Yazdak the scribe record the names of\nall his Byzantine allies, amongst whom he then distributes 2,500 purses, containing each ten thousand dirhams, and a thousand qint\u0101r of gold, each consisting of forty mithq\u0101ls; besides which he sends magnificent gifts to the Emperor, Theodosius, and the hazarmards [explained on f. 182a: \u0627\u0644\u0647\u0632\u0627\u0631\u062f\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062c\u0644 \u0645\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u064a\u0639\u062f \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0641 \u0631\u062c\u0644]. The Byzantines then return home, while Parviz proceeds to his capital Mad\u0101'in, makes Bind\u016b'\u0113 his prime minister, Bist\u0101m governor of Khur\u0101s\u0101n, S\u012bst\u0101n, Tabarist\u0101n, Jurj\u0101n, etc., and divides Persia into thirty-five administrative departments [cf. D. 102].\n\n22. Khusrau Pareiz (A.D. 590\u2013627: N. 178a\u2013212b; D. 91\u2013115).\n\nThe story now reverts to Bahr\u0101m Ch\u016bb\u012bn, his reception by the Turkish Kh\u0101q\u0101n, and his duel with the rebellious and arrogant brother of the latter, here called Yaghz\u012bn [\u064a\u063a\u0632\u06cc\u0646, in one place \u064a\u063a\u0632\u0648\u0646; D. \u0628\u06af\u0648\u06cc\u0631 Boghaicir]. At this point the following incident, lacking in D., is introduced (f. 187). One day when Bahr\u0101m is talking with the Kh\u0101q\u0101n, the wife of the latter, the Turkish Kh\u0101t\u016bn, enters, and asks his help in recovering her daughter, who had been carried off by an ape to a cave in the mountains, whence it has hitherto been impossible to rescue her, because the ape hurls down stones on all who approach, and, if they would shoot at it, holds the girl before it as a target. Bahr\u0101m goes to her rescue, and, when the ape shields itself behind the girl, bids her lift her arm a little, and, through the space thus left, mortally wounds the ape with an arrow, rescues her, and hands her over uninjured to her mother. By this achievement his influence and power are still further increased.\n\nThe account of Bahr\u0101m Ch\u016bb\u012bn's assassination, and the exodus of his comrades, led by his brother Mard\u0101n-sh\u012bna and his brave and beautiful sister Gurd\u012bya, from the land of the Turks to Daylam, agrees closely with D., but is\nsomewhat fuller in the particulars of his death, his dying injunctions, and his funeral, and adds that the Turkish slave who assassinated him was put to death with seventeen others. Khusraw Parviz is delighted on learning that his powerful opponent is no more, and the day of Bahr\u00e1m Ch\u00fabin\u2019s death is thereafter observed in Persia as a festival until the fall of the S\u00e1s\u00e1nian dynasty. The Kh\u00e1q\u00e1n, on the other hand, does all in his power to show his grief and to make amends to Bahr\u00e1m\u2019s followers, to whom he offers the alternatives either of remaining with him as honoured and protected guests, or of returning, duly guarded and guided, to their own country. Disgusted with Turkish treachery, they choose the latter course, and are accordingly suffered to depart, loaded with presents, under a guard of a thousand men, who are to conduct them safely to the frontier. Now the Kh\u00e1q\u00e1n had a brother named Barnagh [\u0628\u064e\u0631\u0646\u064e\u062c or \u0628\u064e\u0631\u0646\u064e\u062c; T. 289, Natr\u00e1 (?)] who loved the beautiful Gurd\u00edya, whose hand he had sought in vain during her brother\u2019s lifetime. He now attempts to take her by force, but she, armed with her brother\u2019s arms and mounted on his horse, charges him with her spear and slays him. Barnagh\u2019s followers desire to kill her in revenge, but the Kh\u00e1q\u00e1n, hearing of what has happened, has them seized and beheaded, and the Persians depart in peace, reach Daylam, conclude a treaty with the inhabitants, and settle there.\n\nWe now come to that part of the narrative which deals with the execution of Bind\u00fa\u2019\u00e9 by Parviz, the revolt of B\u00edst\u00e1m (cf. T., pp. 478\u2013487, \u201cEmp\u00f6rung des B\u00edst\u00e1m\u201d), his campaign against Parviz, his assassination by his wife Gurd\u00edya, the sister of Bahr\u00e1m Ch\u00fabin, at the instigation of the King, and Gurd\u00edya\u2019s marriage with the latter. This portion differs very little from D. (pp. 105\u2013110). For [D. 105] N. has \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0648\u0627\u0631. When Parviz sends off a reassuring letter to persuade B\u00edst\u00e1m to come to him, he writes also to Sh\u00e1p\u00far, the son of \u00c1bark\u00e1n, governor of Ray, ordering him to seize and behead B\u00edst\u00e1m on his arrival, and send the head to him. B\u00edst\u00e1m receives the\nKing's summons at Merv (\u0645\u0631\u0648), and Mard\u00e1n-bih's warning at Qumis. On hearing of Bind\u00fa'\u00eb's death he faints, but is presently restored by the cold water dashed over him by his comrades. The check of the King's generals at Hamad\u00e1n is here described as a defeat, the reinforcements brought by the King are numbered at 200,000 instead of 50,000 [D. 108] men, and their halt is placed at M\u00e1h\u00edn instead of Qal\u00fas, while the ensuing battle at Hamad\u00e1n, whither they advance by Shar\u00e1hin (\u0634\u0631\u0627\u06cc\u06cc\u0646), is said to have lasted not three but two days. Gurd\u00ed is described as the brother, not the nephew, of Bahr\u00e1m Ch\u00e1b\u00edn, and the name of his wife, by whose means he forwards the King's letter to Gurd\u00edya, is given as Arjiya (\u0627\u0631\u062c\u06cc\u0627). Qazw\u00edn is here described as being built, not merely garrisoned [D. 110], by Parv\u00edz.\n\nAt this point [=D. 110, I. 13] comes another considerable insertion. First, the King's marriage with Gurd\u00edya, and the extraordinary honours and favours lavished by him upon her and Gurd\u00ed (who is made Governor of F\u00e1rs), are described. Then a conversation between Parv\u00edz and Gurd\u00edya is reported, in which the King enquires of her how she succeeded in slaying the Kh\u00e1g\u00e1n's brother Barnagh (here called \u0628\u0631\u062a\u062e). She describes this achievement, and then exhibits to the King her skill in military exercises and in the game of polo. The King's wife, Sh\u00edr\u00edn, cautions him against Gurd\u00edya, \"this she-devil.\" Then follow some particulars about Sh\u00edr\u00edn, and an anecdote relating how she humbles the misogynist Mub\u00e1than-mub\u00e1th, which I give in the original (ff. 193-194):\n\n\u0642\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627 \u0648\u0644\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u062f\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0631

connected with it (cf. 194a\u2013205a), omitted by Dinawari, but given by Tabar\u00ed (T. 303\u2013346). They are here arranged under the reign of an-Nu'm\u00e1n b. al-Mundhir, and begin\nNow, let us turn to the story of Nasreddin. Nasreddin was a man who lived in a village near the city of Baghdad. He was known for his wisdom and his sense of humor.\n\nOne day, Nasreddin went to the market to buy some fruit. As he walked through the bazaar, he heard a group of children playing a game. They were trying to see who could throw a stone the farthest.\n\nNasreddin stopped to watch them play. He noticed that the children were using rocks from a nearby riverbed. Nasreddin thought to himself, \"These children are very clever. They have figured out how to use the rocks to their advantage.\"\n\nAs Nasreddin continued his walk, he passed by a group of men who were selling fish. Nasreddin asked one of the men if he knew where he could find some fresh fish.\n\nThe man replied, \"Ah, Nasreddin! You always come here looking for something. This morning, I had a customer who came in looking for fish. He bought two pounds and left without paying.\"\n\nNasreddin was surprised. He thought to himself, \"This man is very honest. He didn't want to take advantage of someone else's misfortune.\"\n\nAs Nasreddin walked further into the market, he heard a group of women talking about the weather. They were complaining about the rain and how it had ruined their crops.\n\nNasreddin stopped to listen to their conversation. He thought to himself, \"These women are very unlucky. They have been hit by bad weather twice in one week.\"\n\nAs Nasreddin continued his walk, he passed by a group of soldiers who were guarding the city gates. Nasreddin asked one of the soldiers if he knew where he could find some armor.\n\nThe soldier replied, \"Ah, Nasreddin! You always come here looking for something. This morning, I had a customer who came in looking for armor. He bought a set and left without paying.\"\n\nNasreddin was surprised again. He thought to himself, \"This soldier is very honest. He didn't want to take advantage of someone else's misfortune.\"\n\nAs Nasreddin walked back to his home, he thought about all the people he had met that day. He realized that there were many good people in the world, and he felt grateful for their kindness.\n\nThe end.\nthe son of Khusraw Parviz, \"if I am not mistaken, from the hands of this boy,\" to which the King replies, \"Well, so that it be after my time, I care not how it shall be.\" He then sends off the Arab envoys with a gift of 1,000 dirhams apiece, and a letter to Nu'm\u00e1n, bidding each tribe choose for itself a king. Nu'm\u00e1n convenes them at Khawarnaq and communicates to them the substance of this letter, whereupon the tribes choose as follows: Himyar chooses 'Amr b. al-\u1e24\u00e1rit b. Sayf b. Dh\u00ed Yazan; Kinda, Qays b. Ma'di-Karib; Ghass\u0101n, Sahl b. Malik b. Shimr; Taym, H\u00e1jib b. Zur\u00e1ra; Qays, al-\u0100\u1e25w\u0101\u1e63 b. Ja'far b. Kill\u0101b al-'Amiri; Fiz\u0101ra, Kh\u0101rija b. \u1e24isn b. Hudhayfa; and Rab\u012b'a, Qays b. Mas'ud. These seven Nu'm\u00e1n equips and sends to Khusraw, who crowns them and makes them kings over their respective tribes.\n\nThe causes which led to the battle of Dh\u00fa Q\u00e1r began with the murder of the above-mentioned 'Adi b. Zayd by Nu'm\u00e1n b. al-Mundhir. His father Zayd had been sent by Q\u00e1b\u016bs b. Nu'm\u00e1n (called Ibn M\u0101'i's-sam\u0101') as an ambassador to Hormuzd, who was so pleased with him that he detained him as his secretary and interpreter. This Zayd died soon after the accession of Khusraw Parviz, who appointed his son 'Adi to fill his place. Now between the family of 'Adi b. Zayd and the Ban\u016b Nufayla (to which belonged the aged 'Abdu'l-Masih), said to have been 350 years old at this time!) there was an ancient feud, in consequence of which one of the latter informed Nu'm\u00e1n that 'Adi had boasted that he, by his influence with the Persian King, had obtained for Nu'm\u00e1n the kingdom of Hira, a statement which greatly enraged him. It was 'Adi's custom to spend three months every year with his family at Hira; and, on the occasion of this visit, the Nufayli, by means of a forged letter, so increased Nu'm\u00e1n's anger that he cast him into prison. 'Adi thereupon wrote to his brother Ubayy, who was in high favour at the Persian Court, informing him of his imprisonment. Ubayy made the matter known to Khusraw Parviz, who at once sent a messenger to Nu'm\u00e1n, bidding him release 'Adi and\nsend him at once to Mad\u00e1'in. The messenger, on reaching \u1e24\u00edra, first visited \u2018Ad\u00ed in prison and informed him of his commission. \u2018Ad\u00ed begged him not to leave him, lest he should be put to death by Nu\u2019m\u00e1n, which, in fact, actually happens so soon as the messenger has departed.\n\nMeanwhile the messenger presents the Persian King\u2019s letter to Nu\u2019m\u00e1n, who bids him take \u2018Ad\u00ed out of prison; but on arriving at the prison he finds \u2018Ad\u00ed strangled. Nu\u2019m\u00e1n then gives him a thousand d\u00edn\u00e1rs to induce him to put a good complexion on the matter in his report to Khusraw Parv\u00edz, who, however, learns the truth from the son of the murdered man, who succeeds in effecting his escape. This son is called Zayd, like his grandfather, and inherits the highest skill of his father and grandfather (f. 202a):\n\n\u0648\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0632\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0628\u0648\u0628\u0647 \u0648 \u062c\u062f\u0647 \u0632\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0639\u062f\u062b \u0645\u0627\u0647\u0631\u06cc\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0626\u0626\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u064a\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0637\u062a\u064a\u0646\n\nHe tells Khusraw Parv\u00edz of the beauty of Nu\u2019m\u00e1n\u2019s daughter Hurayqa, his sister Su\u2019da, and his cousin Lub\u00e1b. The King thereupon orders him to write to Nu\u2019m\u00e1n bidding him send these women to the Persian Court. Nu\u2019m\u00e1n, on receiving this letter, exclaims:\n\n\u0623\u0645\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u0627\u062f \u0648 \u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633 \u0645\u0627 \u064a\u063a\u0646\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0639\u0646 \u0646\u0633\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0628\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0645\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u0642\n\nZayd purposely mistranslates \u0639\u064a\u0646 (\u201cwild cattle,\u201d according to N., but rather, as N\u00f6ldeke translates, \u201cthe large-eyed ones,\u201d T. 328\u2013329) as \u0628\u0642\u0631, \u201ccows,\u201d to the Persian royal eunuch who accompanies him. When this reply is reported to Khusraw Parv\u00edz he is greatly angered against Nu\u2019m\u00e1n, confers the government of \u1e24\u00edra on his former ally Ay\u00e1s b. Qab\u00edsa, and commands that Nu\u2019m\u00e1n shall be brought to him in chains. Nu\u2019m\u00e1n, forewarned of this, flees from \u1e24\u00edra, leaving his female relatives and property\nunder the care of H\u00e1ni b. Mas'ud al-Muzdalif ash-Shayb\u00e1ni, and endeavours to stir up the Arab tribes to revolt against the Persian King. Meeting with but little success in this endeavour, he goes to Mad\u00e1'in, surrenders himself to Khusraw Parv\u00edz, and assures the Persian King that his expression was misinterpreted by Zayd. Parv\u00edz, however, rejects his excuses, and orders him to be trampled to death by elephants. The beautiful Hurayqa (or \u062d\u0631\u064a\u0642\u0629, or \u062d\u0631\u064a\u0642\u0629) embraces the Christian religion after her father's death, and becomes a nun at Dayr Hind.\n\nThe Persian King, having slain Nu'm\u00e1n in this manner, sends a message to Ay\u00e1s b. Qabis\u00e1 bidding him send his children, servants, and possessions to Mad\u00e1'in. H\u00e1ni al-Muzdalif, however, to whose care they had been entrusted by Nu'm\u00e1n, refuses to give them up. Khusraw Parv\u00edz, on hearing this, bids Ay\u00e1s attack the tribe of Bakr b. Wr\u00e1'il, and sends 12,000 troops under H\u00e1marz and the same number under Hormuzd Khurr\u00e1-ba-z\u00edn, besides another force under Qays b. Mas'ud, Warden of the Marches of Chaldea, to extirpate the tribe, who are encamped at a place called Dh\u00fa Q\u00e1r, five stages out from Madina on the Basra road. This was in the year A.H. 1, just after the arrival of the Prophet Mu\u1e25ammad at Madina, and Bakr b. Wr\u00e1'il, though not yet professing belief in the Prophet, recited poems in his praise and invoked his name to their assistance.\n\nWe now come to the actual battle of Dh\u00fa Q\u00e1r, whereof the Prophet said (f. 205a):\n\n\"Today is the first day whereon the Arabs held their own against the Persians, and through me did they conquer\"; that is, by his name, when they chose as their battle-cry, \"O Mu\u1e25ammad!\"\n\nThe preparations for battle on both sides are described. \u1e24andhala b. Suyy\u00e1r cuts down the women's litters, so that flight shall be impossible for his Arabs. Ay\u00e1s b. Qabis\u00e1, unwilling to fight against his compatriots, proposes to them\nthree alternatives, but they elect battle. H\u00e1marz, the Persian general, comes out and challenges to single combat with the cry \"Mard [u] mard!\" (cf. D. 130), \"Man and man\" (\u0645\u064e\u0631\u062f\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0625\u0650\u0628\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0632\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0631\u064e\u062c\u064f\u0644\u064c \u0625\u0650\u0628\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0632\u064c). This challenge is accepted, and he is slain by Zayd b. \u1e24amm\u00e1d al-Yashkuri. The Persians suffer from want of water. Night intervenes, and the Arab allies of the Persians agree to desert to the side of their compatriots on the following day. Notwithstanding this defection, and the thirst which consumes them, the Persians fight gallantly, but their leader Khurr\u00e1-ba-z\u00edn falls, and they are routed and slain.\u2014Poems composed by the Arabs on this occasion.\u2014Grief and anger of the Persian King.\n\nThe narrative (f. 205a = D. 110, l. 13) now rejoins Dinawari in the account of the eventually disastrous campaign against the Byzantines, which immediately preceded the deposition and murder of Khusr\u00e1w Parv\u00edz. The names of the three Persian generals are here given as Sh\u00e1h\u00edn (as in D. 110), Shahr-bund\u00e1d (D. B\u00faz, T. Rum-b\u00fas\u00e1n), and Shahr\u00e1n-z\u00e1d (D. Shahriy\u00e1r). Their operations, till the tide of fortune is turned by Heraclius, are similarly recounted, and the reference to the Byzantine successes in the Qur'\u00e1n (xxx, 1 et seqq.; cf. T. 297) is noted; but in the section on the Cause of the Murder of Khusr\u00e1w Parv\u00edz (f. 205b) the Nih\u00e1yat again becomes much fuller.\n\nKhusr\u00e1w, angered at the defeat of his army and suspecting cowardice or treachery, makes out a list of 20,000 soldiers [cf. D. 111, ll. 15 et seqq.] whom he consigns to prison, intending to kill them. He then makes a low-born man named Khur\u00e1dh\u00edn minister of finance, who, by his extortions, increases the popular discontent. For Khusr\u00e1w possessed vast treasures, of which an inventory was made in the thirty-fifth year of his reign, when his property included 5,000 concubines, 1,000 handmaidens, 8,500 horses, 900 elephants, 12,000 mules, 400,000,000 purses of dirhams, 100,000 purses of dinars, and a vast quantity of jewels, gold and silver plate, furs, precious fabrics, and the like.\nWhen he had reigned thirty-seven years, he ordered the captain of his guard to kill the imprisoned soldiers. \"How,\" replied he, \"shall I kill 20,000 men?\" The King orders him to kill a thousand each day, but he, fearing trouble, takes no action.\n\nAt this juncture arrives the letter from the Prophet Muhammad bidding the Persian King embrace Isl\u00e1m or do battle in the following words:\n\n\u0628\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u064a\u0645\u060c \u0645\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0631\u0633\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0643\u0633\u0631\u0649 \u0628\u0646 \u0647\u0631\u0645\u0632\u060c \u0623\u062a\u0649 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0641\u0623\u062a\u064a \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0625\u0644\u064a\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0644\u0627 \u0625\u0644\u0647 \u0625\u0644\u0627 \u0647\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0623\u0648\u0627\u064a \u0648\u0643\u062a\u0628\u062a \u0628\u064a\u062a\u0627\u064b \u0648\u0623\u0641\u062a\u064a\u062a \u0648\u0643\u062a\u0628\u062a \u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u064b \u0648\u0647\u062f\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0648\u0643\u062a\u0628\u062a \u0646\u0627\u0641\u064a\u0627\u064b \u0648\u0623\u0628\u064a \u064a\u062f\u0639 \u0645\u0627 \u0623\u0631\u0633\u0644\u062a \u0628\u0647 \u0623\u0645\u0633 \u0642\u062f \u0633\u0644\u0628 \u0645\u0642\u0648\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u062e\u0627\u0644\u0628 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647\u060c \u0623\u0645\u0627 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u064a\u0627 \u0643\u0633\u0631\u0649 \u0641\u0627\u0633\u0644\u0645 \u062a\u0633\u0644\u0645 \u0623\u0648 \u0623\u064a\u0630\u0646 \u0628\u062d\u0631\u0628 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0631\u0633\u0648\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u0646 \u064a\u062c\u0632\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\n\nKhusraw Parv\u00edz, infuriated at this letter, writes to B\u00e1dh\u00e1n, his governor in Yaman, bidding him march on Madina, fight Muhammad, take him prisoner, and send him to the Persian capital. He bids the messenger who bears this letter (a man of ascetic and pious life named Ab\u00e1n\u00fa\u2019\u00e9) go first to Madina and invite Muhammad to come in person and explain his doctrine to the Persian King. In case of his refusal, the letter to B\u00e1dh\u00e1n is then to be delivered. On reaching Madina, Ab\u00e1n\u00fa\u2019\u00e9 is informed by the Prophet that Parv\u00edz is no longer King, having been deposed on the previous day by his son Sh\u00edr\u00e1\u2019\u00fa\u00e9. Ab\u00e1n\u00fa\u2019\u00e9, not believing this, goes to Yaman and delivers the letter to B\u00e1dh\u00e1n, who decides to wait for news from Persia before taking any action. Soon a letter arrives from Sh\u00edr\u00e1\u2019\u00fa\u00e9 announcing his accession, and bidding B\u00e1dh\u00e1n not to molest Muhammad. B\u00e1dh\u00e1n and many of his Persian followers are hereby converted to Isl\u00e1m.\n\nNext comes the account of the various portents by which Khusraw Parv\u00edz is warned that his death and the destruction\nof his dynasty are at hand. These include a warning vision, a visitation by an angel, who breaks the staff which typifies the Persian power, and the writing on the wall, of which the purport in Arabic is given as follows:\n\n\u0625\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0627\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062f\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064f\u0635\u0652\u0637\u064e\u0639\u0650\u0641\u064f \u0625\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0651 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u064e \u0642\u064e\u062f\u0652 \u0628\u064e\u0639\u064e\u062b\u064e \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u062e\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0642\u0650\u0647\u0650 \u0631\u064e\u0633\u064f\u0648\u0644\u064b\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0632\u064e\u0644\u064e \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0647\u0650 \u0643\u0650\u062a\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064b\u0627 \u0641\u064e\u0627\u0633\u0652\u0644\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0648\u064e\u0622\u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u0628\u0650\u0647\u0650 \u062c\u064e\u0645\u0650\u064a\u0639\u064b\u0627 \u0644\u064e\u0643\u064e \u062e\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0631\u064f \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064e\u0651\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0622\u062e\u0650\u0631\u064e\u0629\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0643\u064e\u0631\u0652 \u0625\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u0644\u064e\u0645\u0652 \u062a\u064e\u0641\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0644\u0652 \u0647\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0643\u064e\u062a\u0652 \u0639\u064e\u0646\u0652 \u0642\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u0628\u064d \u0648\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0627\u062f\u064e \u0645\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0643\u064f\u0643\u064e \u0648\u064e\u0632\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e \u0639\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0643\u064e \u0633\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627\u0637\u064e\u062a\u064f\u0643\u064e\n\nKhusr\u0101w Parviz, however, continues impenitent, and persists in his intention of putting to death the imprisoned soldiers, whose comrades and friends thereupon depose him, and make Sh\u012br\u016b\u02be\u0113, his son by Maryam, the Byzantine Princess, King in his place. The first intimation that Parviz has of this is that, awaking early in the morning, he hears the watchmen around the palace crying, \u201cP\u0101s! p\u0101s! Sh\u012br\u016b\u02be\u0113 Sh\u0101hansh\u0101h!\u201d (\u201cWatch! watch! Sh\u012br\u016b\u02be\u0113 is King!\u201d; cf. T. 357 and p. 202, supra). He escapes by a rope from his palace and flees to a garden called \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0647\u0631\u062c\u0627\u0646, where he hides, but is discovered later, and imprisoned in the house of a marzub\u0101n named \u0647\u0631\u0633\u062a\u0647 (D. 112). Thither he is conveyed, with veiled face, on a sorry horse, escorted by about a hundred troopers. On the way they pass the shop of a cobbler, who insults the fallen King with cries of \u201cWretch! Libertine! Tyrant!\u201d and finally hurls a boot at him which strikes his horse. Thereupon one of the troopers turns back, reviles the cobbler, and cuts off his head. The deposed King is finally committed to the custody of one \u1e24il\u016bs or Hayl\u016bs \u062d\u064a\u0644\u0648\u0633, but lower \u062c\u064a\u0644\u0648\u0633: D. 111, l. 19; T. \u062c\u064a\u0644\u0648\u0633 with a guard of 500 men.\n\n23. Sh\u012br\u016b\u02be\u0113 (A.D. 627\u2013628: N. 208a\u2013212b; D. 111\u2013116).\n\nSh\u012br\u016b\u02be\u0113 begins his reign with the usual throne-speech and a distribution of gifts and remission of taxes. The nobles tell him that he must put his father to death, or else they will depose him. He asks for a day\u2019s delay to investigate\nthe late King's alleged misdeeds, and sends his chief secretary (here called Asht\u0101d-Gushnas, \u0627\u0634\u062a\u0627\u062f \u062c\u0634\u0646\u0627\u0633, elsewhere \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u062f \u062c\u0634\u0646\u0627\u0633, \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u062f \u062d\u0634\u0646\u0627\u0633, \u0627\u0634\u062a\u0627\u062f \u062d\u0634\u0646\u0627\u0633, and \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u062f \u062c\u0634\u0646\u0627\u0633: D. 112, Yazdan-Gushnas; T. 362, Aspadla-Gushnap) to conduct this enquiry. The charges against the deposed King (D. 112\u2013113; T. 363\u2013368) are chiefly: (1) His cruel treatment of his own father, Hurmuzd; (2) his harshness towards his sons; (3) the proposed execution of the 20,000 soldiers; (4) his greed in appropriating to himself so many wives and concubines, of whom he could not take proper care; (5) his appointment of the ignoble Khurd\u0101dhin (lower, Khurz\u0101dhin) as finance minister, and the sanctioning of his exactions; (6) his ingratitude towards the Byzantine Empire (the Emperor's son is here called \u0646\u06cc\u06a9\u0648\u067e\u0648\u0644\u0648\u0633), and his refusal to return the Wood of the True Cross; (7) his slaying Nu'm\u0101n b. al-Mundhir, notwithstanding the services rendered by him and his ancestors to the Persian Royal Family, from the time of Bahram G\u016br, because he refused to give up his daughter Hurayqa. Sh\u012br\u016b'\u0113's letter containing these charges is brought to the prison by Asht\u0101d-Gushnas, whose interviews with the governor of the gaol, Jayl\u016bs, and with the deposed King, are described with great detail (f. 209), including the bad augury drawn by the latter from a quince which was lying beside him on a cushion, and which, being disturbed, rolled on to the carpet and thence into the dust (T. 367\u2013368). Khusraw Parviz's categorical reply to Sh\u012br\u016b'\u0113's accusations agrees closely with \u1e6cabar\u012b (pp. 370\u2013379). The Indian King Purum\u0113sha, by whose astrologers Sh\u012br\u016b'\u0113's accession and the date thereof were predicted, is here called \u062a\u0631\u0628\u06cc\u0633 (cf. D. 113, l. 19). The third accusation and its answer differ from T. in that there it is a question of imprisonment only, not of execution. In the reply to the fifth accusation mention is made of the peculiar Court of Appeal (\u062f\u06a9\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062e\u062a\u0627\u0631) established by Khusraw Parviz and described by the Nidh\u0101mu'l-Mulk in his S\u012by\u0101sat-n\u0101ma (ed. Schefer, p. 10). The Indian King's comparison of Persia to a garden [D. 114, l. 18; T. 375, n. 1 ad calc.: the King\nis here called also occurs here (f. 211a). The sum given to the Byzantine Emperor, placed by D. (p. 114) at a million dirhams, is here estimated at 1,500 purses (\u067e\u0631\u06cc\u0647). Khusraw Parviz concludes his categorical answers to the charges brought against him with an eloquent defence of his general policy.\n\nThe murder of Khusraw Parviz is described as in T. 379\u2013382, and his murderer is named, as in that account, Mihr Hormuzd, son of Mard\u00e1sh\u00e1h, but the latter is described, as in D. 115, as P\u00e1dh\u00fasp\u00e1n (\u067e\u0627\u062f\u062d\u0648\u0633\u067e\u0627\u0646) of Babel, not of Nimruz, so that the two accounts seem to be here combined. The date of the murder is wrongly given as A.H. 3 instead of A.H. 6 (cf. T. 382, n. 2 ad calc.: Feb. 29, 628). Shir\u00fa'e's prime minister is here named, as in the Majm\u00fa' and Persian Tabari, Barmak son of Piruz, the ancestor of the Barmecides (cf. T. 383, n. 2 ad calc.). The names of the seventeen brothers murdered by the parrioiide (cf. T. 383, n. 1 ad calc.) are here given as follows:\n\nSeven months later, having reigned only eight months, he falls sick and dies, and is succeeded by his little son Ardashir, who is made King under the regency of a man named Mih-Adhar-Gushnasp (\u0645\u06cc\u200c\u0627\u062f\u0647\u0631\u06af\u0634\u0646\u0627\u0633\u067e: cf. T. 386).\n\nThe Fall of the Sasanian Dynasty (A.D. 628\u2013652:\nN. 212b\u2013230b; D. 116\u2013149).\n\nThe short and troubled reigns of the remaining kings and queens of the House of Sasan need hardly be separated. Our text here follows Tabari rather than Dinawari. The army of the usurper Shahrvar\u00e1z (here \u0634\u0647\u0631\u0648\u0627\u0631\u0632, an obvious corruption) is, however, estimated at 24,000 instead of 6,000 men (cf. T. 387 and n. 2 ad calc.), and the details\nof his treachery are omitted, while the account of his assassination is much abridged. P\u016br\u0101n-dukht, daughter of Khusraw Parviz, is then made queen, while her little brother (son of Parviz and Gurdia, named Juc\u0101nshir in D. 116) is being educated to assume the reins of government; but he dies six months later, and she is confirmed on the throne, issues an address to her subjects, remits one-third of the taxes, dies after a wise reign of thirteen months (T. 392 has \"sixteen months\"), and is succeeded by her sister Azarmi-dukht.\n\nWe now come to the final portion of the book, describing the Arab invasion and conquest of Persia, which agrees very closely with Dinawari, though the arrangement of the matter is slightly different, viz.: D. 116\u2013122; 124\u2013125; 136\u2013137; 126\u2013127; 129\u2013130; 133\u2013137; 141\u2013145; 137\u2013140; 148\u2013149. The Nih\u0101yat confines itself more to Persian affairs, and has the following additions and variations. 'Umar's harangue on his accession [D. 118].\u2014His letter to al-Muthann\u0101 [D. 118].\u2014The name of Azarmi-dukht stands for that of P\u016br\u0101n-dukht [D. 120, l. 2].\u2014On the same page, the battle is here more fully described: the Persians, after their first rout, reform at Nahr-Salim, and Mibr\u0101n challenges al-Muthann\u0101 to single combat, and is slain by him. Dayr-Qub\u0101dh stands for Abar-Qub\u0101dh [D. 124, l. 8]. Rustam, when he has encamped at Dayr'n-l-A'war [D. 126], sends for the notables of Hira, amongst whom is the aged 'Abdu'l-Mas\u012bh b. \u1e24ayy\u0101n (then about 300 years old), and reproaches them for their sympathy with the Arabs. 'Abdu'l-Mas\u012bh, acting as their spokesman, answers as follows (f. 218b):\n\n\u0641\u0642\u0627\u0644 \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062c\u0649 \u0627\u0645\u0627 \u0642\u0648\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0641\u0631\u062c\u0646\u0627 \u0628\u062c\u0645\u064a\u0639\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0628\u0644\u0627\u062f\u0643\u0645 \u0643\u064a\u0641 \u0646\u062e\u0631\u062c \u0648\u0644\u064a\u0633\u0648\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u062a\u0646\u0646\u0627 \u0648\u0646\u062d\u0646 \u0642\u0648\u0645 \u0646\u0635\u0627\u0631\u0649 \u0648\u0647\u0645 \u064a\u0634\u0647\u062f\u0648\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0646\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0643\u0641\u0631\u060c \u0627\u0645\u0627 \u0642\u0648\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0635\u0631\u0646\u0627 \u0639\u064a\u0648\u0646\u0627 \u0644\u0647\u0645 \u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0643\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0627 \u064a\u062d\u062a\u0627\u062c\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u064a\u0648\u0646 \u0648\u0642\u062f \u0647\u0631\u0628 \u0627\u0635\u0627\u0628\u0639\u0643\u0645 \u0648\u0627\u062e\u0644\u0648\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0644\u0627\u062f \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u0639 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0632\u0631\u0639\nOn the same page [D. 126] some additional particulars are here given of the exploit of Tulayha, who kills four [D. \u201ctwo\u201d] of his pursuers and captures the survivor, whom he brings before the Arab general, Sa\u2019d b. Abi Waqq\u0101s, and compels to describe the exploit, and to give information through an interpreter about the position and strength of the Persian army (estimated at 50,000). This Persian captive then embraces Isl\u00e1m.\n\nThe interview of Rustam [D. 127] with al-Mugh\u00edra, the Arab envoy, is also described here with greater detail. Rustam offers the Arabs abundance of food, and presents of 1000 din\u00e1rs for \u2018Umar, 500 for Sa\u2019d, 200 each to a hundred of the chief am\u00edrs, 100 each to a thousand minor captains, and 20 each to the soldiers. On al-Mugh\u00edra\u2019s refusal of this proposition and offer of the usual alternatives, Rustam relates the parable of the Fox in the Vineyard (essentially identical with that of the Weasel in the Henhouse in \u00c6sop), to which he compares the greedy Arabs. A few additional details of the ensuing battle, in which the Persians are said to number 100,000 men and 12 elephants, and the Muslims only 24,000 men, are given, including the part played by the Arab women and children in checking the initial Arab retreat, the death of two Persian champions (has\u00e1r-mard), and the confusion caused in the Persian ranks by a wounded elephant (lacuna of one leaf, viz. f. 223). The Persian words dir\u00e1n \u00e1madand cited by D. (p. 133, last line) are\nhere explained in Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0634\u064a\u0627\u0637\u064a\u0646 \u0642\u062f \u0627\u0642\u0628\u0644\u0648\u0627. The Persian commander called Khurr\u00e1z\u00e1dh by D. (p. 133) is here called Khurd\u00e1dh. The simplicity of the Arabs, as shown by their ignorance of the value of gold and camphor, is related as in al-Fakhri (ed. Ahlwardt, p. 100). The crown of Khusr\u00e1w Parv\u00edz is said to have been amongst the spoils taken at al-Mad\u00e1'in, and to have been sent to \u2018Umar, who hung it up in the Ka\u2018ba at Mecca, \u201cwhere it remains till this day\u201d (f. 244b). Nah\u00e1vand stands for Hulw\u00e1n in D. 135, last line. The Persian army, gathered together at Nah\u00e1vand, described by D. [p. 141, l. 12] merely as \u201ca great host,\u201d is here estimated at 300,000 men. The names of the Arab positions before the Battle of Nah\u00e1vand are nearly the same as in D. 143, viz. \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0631\u0647 and \u0645\u062f\u0646\u06cc\u0627\u0646, while the name of the position (distant half a parasang from the Arab lines) occupied by the Persians under Mard\u00e1ns\u00e1h is given as \u062d\u0645\u0644\u0647, near a mountain called \u0627\u0631\u0645. The Arab army is estimated at one-tenth of the Persian force, viz. 30,000 men. The battle is described as beginning on a Wednesday [D. 144, \u201cTuesday\u201d]. The Friday is passed by the Arabs in prayer, but by the Persians in wine-drinking and song\u2014an exact parallel to the Norman account of the eve of the Battle of Hastings. The above-mentioned mountain of \u0627\u0631\u0645 (so pointed in this place) takes the place of Diz-Yzad in D. 144, l. 19. The number of Persians who perish in the ditch is stated at \u201cabout 100\u201d\u2014probably a clerical error for 100,000, since otherwise the words \u201cGod made this a destruction to them\u201d would hardly be justified\u2014while those slain in the battle are estimated at 40,000. A further stand is made by some of the local marzub\u00e1ns and nobles at a village to the north of Nah\u00e1vand named \u0646\u0647\u0631\u0647 \u062f\u0631\u06a9\u0627\u0646 (lower, \u0646\u0647\u0631\u0647 \u062f\u0631\u06a9\u0627\u0646), which place is surrendered by Din\u00e1r [D. 145]. The traitor who admits the Arabs into Shushtar is here called Shanb\u00e1k [D. 138, \u201cSina\u201d]; his fate is described as in D. The story of Hurmuz\u00e1n before \u2018Umar, omitted by D. [p. 140] as too well known to need repetition, is here given in full, in the usual form. The\ndeath of Yazdigird, which concludes the narrative, differs from D.'s account in only two or three minute details. The number of troops sent by the Kh\u0101q\u0101n to Merv under the command of a Tarkh\u0101n is given as 30,000, and the name of the river on which was situated the mill where the unfortunate King was murdered, after he had privily escaped from Merv by a cord let down over the city wall, is given as \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u062f\u064a. As to the fate of the traitor M\u0101h\u016b'\u0113, it is said that he escaped to F\u0101rs [D. 149, \"Abar-shahr\"] and took refuge with 'Uthm\u0101n, though according to another account he was slain at Merv.\n\nHaving now completed the examination and analysis of the Nih\u0101yat, I feel bound to confess that it has hardly fulfilled my expectations, and that I should have done better to accept N\u00f6ldeke's verdict than to spend so much time in arriving at results which in the main only serve to confirm it. Yet having devoted to it so much labour, and still believing that there are in the book elements of interest, if not of historical value, I desired to make public the results of my toil, that at least others might be spared the necessity of devoting to the work energies which might be better employed. I do not think, closely as it agrees with Dinawar\u012b, that its materials were derived directly therefrom, but rather that both books were drawn from a common source. In some cases, as we have seen, when D. has some expression like \"concerning this the Persians relate many stories,\" the Nih\u0101yat gives in full narratives which are presumably the stories in question. In other cases it contains incidents otherwise known to us only from single sources, including not only such well-known histories as Tab\u0101r\u012b, Hamza, and the Muqniit, but the rare 'Uy\u016bn'l-akhb\u0101r of Ibn Qutayba, the works of al-J\u0101hidh, and the Siyasat-n\u0101ma. To the minor additions\u2014such as the exact numbers given in the case of contending armies, and the like\u2014no great importance can be attached. The numerous throne-speeches, admonitions, and letters cited in full may repose on a Pahlav\u012b original, since it is\ngenerally recognized that such elements entered largely into the Khud\u00e1y-n\u00e1mak, and when such are given in D\u00ednawar\u00ed the correspondence with our text is close, so that they do not appear to be arbitrary embellishments added by the unknown author or compiler. At the lowest estimate, MSS. of the Nih\u00e1yat should undoubtedly be used for help and control by any future translator of the earlier portion of D\u00ednawar\u00ed's delightful history.\n\nPostscript.\n\nSince the above article was in type and finally paged, I have, with the help of my friend and colleague Mr. Ellis H. Minns, finished the perusal of Baron Rosen's article in the Vostochniya Zamy\u00e9thi, and have learned that practically all the stories about Khusr\u00e1w Parv\u00edz, Sh\u00edr\u00edn, and G\u00fardiya, to which reference is made on pp. 243\u2013245, supra (including the Story of Mushk\u00e1d\u00e1na and the M\u00fabadh\u00e1n-m\u00e1b\u00e1dh, of which the Arabic text is here printed), are contained in the Kit\u00e1b\u00fa'l-Mah\u00e1s\u00edn wa'l-\u00c1dd\u00edd, ascribed to al-J\u00e1hidh (ed. Van Vloten, pp. 252\u2013257). Had I been aware of this sooner, I should not, of course, have reprinted this extract. Essentially the same story is, I believe, told of Aristotle (who takes the place of the M\u00fabadh) and Alexander (who takes the place of Khusr\u00e1w Parv\u00edz).\nART. XI.\u2014The Villages of Goa in the Early Sixteenth Century. By B. H. Baden-Powell, C.I.E., M.R.A.S.\n\nIn the following pages I have endeavoured to present an account of the contents of a document, which needs some special acquaintance with the details of village history to understand it, but which possesses considerable interest since it is the earliest known account of a local group of Indian villages written by an European observer.\n\nThe document is an official charter or record of customs (Foral dos usos e costumes) dated September 16, 1526, under the authority of Don Jo\u00e3o, \"King of Portugal, etc., and lord . . . of the conquest, navigation, and commerce of Ethiopia, Arabia, Persia and India.\" The original (in Portuguese) forms No. 58 in Fasciculus 5 of the Archivo Portuguez oriental. This 'fasciculus' itself consists of three volumes, printed at Goa in 1863.\n\nMr. R. S. Whiteway has already published an abstract at p. 216 of his \"Rise of the Portuguese Power in India, 1497-1550\"; but he has kindly placed at my disposal his manuscript translation of the original, and as there are several matters in it which deserve more specific record than his abstract gives, I have, with his help, reproduced the substance of the whole charter in somewhat greater detail. In so doing I have not followed the order of the clauses as they stand in the original; but have endeavoured to make the rules more intelligible, by bringing together under definite heads all that the charter contains on each subject. In the original, the various points are set down, apparently, as they occurred to the writer; so that often\n\nLondon, A. Constable, 1899. Mr. Whiteway (late of the Indian Civil Service) is also the author of the Settlement Report of the Mathura District, N.W.P., so valuable to students of Indian villages.\none or two clauses refer to a given subject, the writer passes on to another matter, and then more on the first subject is given in a later paragraph. At the same time, by always preserving the 'clause' number of the original, I have avoided any difficulty of reference.\n\nIt is needless, perhaps, to say, that the italics are my addition, because the matter is particularly noteworthy.\n\nThe abstract, so rearranged, is followed by a commentary: the capital letters in brackets added to the text, refer to the passages so marked in the commentary.\n\nIn the concluding pages I have endeavoured, with Mr. Whiteway's aid, to give some account of the history of these villages. This is very curious as showing how a village naturally constituted in one way, can undergo a complete transformation in the course of three centuries. And it is also instructive to note that the change was brought about by the effect of a radically bad system of revenue management, under which the responsibility for payment is enforced in a manner not adapted to the real village constitution. The headmen are allowed\u2014indeed, are obliged\u2014to make levies of rents and imposts over the village lands; and when they get into difficulties, they sell the right to receive these dues, in various fractions; thus they themselves lose their position and disappear, while the villages become dominated by a host of purchasers of 'shares' in the proceeds of the land\u2014such sharers having no authority and no recognized position, but being naturally eager to make the most of their claims, are quite unscrupulous as to what they do in order to realize them.\n\nAbstract of a Charter of 1526\n\n(rearranged so as to bring together all the orders relating to the same subject).\n\nPreamble.\u2014The Roll (Foral) purports to be granted to the 'Gancars' or village headmen (A), cultivators, and\ntaxpayers, dwellers in, and [permanent] residents of, the villages in the several islands that make up Goa. The facts, i.e., the amount of revenue, \"the rights [of possession], 'unos' [subsidiary rights], and customs,\" are declared to have been recorded after inquiry, and by ascertaining what the people \"paid to the kings and lords of the soil before it was ours.\" The figures of the Revenue Assessment were set down in a separate roll: the rights and customs are recorded in what follows.\n\nI. The Village Headmen, their origin and privileges.\n\n(Clause 1.) Every village has certain 'Ganears'; in some there are more, in others fewer, according to the custom of the village. The said word (Gancar) means governor, administrator, and benefactor, and was given because in the old times there were four men to establish new cultivation in an island or other waste place. These improved and cultivated the land so that in time there grew up a large inhabited site. And the founders, for their good government, administration, and work at the spread of cultivation, were called 'ganear' and became lords and superiors (sogigadores) over the others, who agreed to pay rent and taxes so that they might remain possessed of their heritable rights and customs. But the true origin of this is unknown (A).\n\n---\n\n1 It is hardly necessary to observe that the Fiscal refers, not to the whole of Goa as it now is (which contains in all 421 villages, many of them not in the condition here described), but only to that portion known as the 'Ilhas' or islands acquired sixteen years before the date of the charter. But in 1543 two other tracts, Salsette (S\u00e2o-ti) and Bardez, were added, and the charter was made applicable to them also. Thus, the 31 villages to which the charter primarily refers, became only part of the area governed by the rules. From the legislation of 1543 we ascertain that at that time the 'Ilhas' contained 58 villages, Salsette 53, and Bardez 59. It may be remarked, by the way, that the increase of 34 villages in 1526, to 38 in 1582, shows how very unimportant must have been the condition of affairs, since only so small an increase of cultivation and population took place. The whole tract to which the charter refers is officially known as the 'Old Compostas' ('Ilhas conquistas').\n\n2 I think this is the meaning: the primary right is to a certain land holding, but to this there are subsidiary, customary rights of user, etc.\n\n3 = sogigadores or overlords, I apprehend.\n(Clause 8.) In order to secure the position of the Gancars, because they are leaders and their office is hereditary, no Gancar (in his own village) can be removed from office\u2014no matter what fault he may commit. Neither can the writer [Kulkarni], since he also holds an hereditary post and was appointed by the said headmen (*e foi posto pelos ditos Gancares*). If either class commits a crime, there may be a penalty in person or goods; and if the punishment is death, the office passes on to the son or next heir. (Then follows a note of the authority that can try offences, according as they are of greater or less gravity.)\n\n(Clause 17.) Should a Gancar *abscend* to avoid payment of his revenue, an assembly of the village called *Gancaria* (*G\u0101nwkaria*) must be held, and a proclamation made for the fugitive. Should this be disregarded, his property will be taken over by the other Gancars [who are jointly liable with him], and they can transfer it to others. [I suppose this means they can farm it out.]\n\n(Clause 18.) But an absconding Gancar's heritable property [i.e. his *watan* or special holding as headman] cannot be taken from him. His heirs must be asked if they will take up the absconder's obligations: if they refuse, or if there are no heirs, the *other Gancars* take over the property, but not the moveable property which in the absence of [direct] heirs escheats to the Crown.\n\n(Clause 19.) If a Gancar or other person dies, or leaves\n\n---\n\n1 This is repeated more than once in the charter. Originally in *raivatw\u0101ri* villages generally, there can hardly be a doubt that the writer (mahato, p\u0101ndya, or kulkarni (Karn and Mar) = the Patw\u0101ri of Northern India) was introduced as part of the hereditary staff, as early as the time when the royal grain-share was first levied from all the cultivators. But in villages founded (as these evidently were) in the waste at a later date, it is quite possible that the writers may have been appointed by the leaders of the colonists.\n\n2 Mr. Whiteway tells me that in the *Archives* there is a note stating that on the margin of the original *Foral* he found an 'old' addition, to the effect that in one village ('Santos' of Salsette) it was the 'custom' to allow the nearest Christian heir to take the property (on paying arrears) in preference to others; and that failing such a convert, the natural heirs should take. In either case the absconder, if he returned, was allowed to recover his position.\n\n3 It will be seen, later, that the rules do not recognize *collateral*, but only direct succession. Ordinarily 'the other' (recognized) Gancars in a village would be collaterals (brothers or cousins) of the absconder, not his sons.\nthe country, having no heirs, any revenue-free land escheats to the Crown [presumably, in view of Clause 18, other than seataun land]. But debts of the deceased may be charged on it, provided a debt to the State ranks first for payment.\n\n(Clause 40.) Should a Gancar of the Island of Chor\u00e3o or others adjoining this island of Tissuary, fly from the country to the 'Moors' (Mussulmans), or in order to avoid paying his revenue, \"as it is said they sometimes do, but we hope they will not do so in future,\" the moveable property will escheat [as already said], and the immoveable and the headmanship [i.e. the collective seataun] will be sold to the highest bidder who agrees to take up the revenue-liability; and any surplus of the price realized, over and above arrears already due, will go to the Treasury. [By custom it was only Gancars who bid at such auctions: see clause 20, post. This clause (40) seems to repeat clauses 17, 18.]\n\nII. The Headmen's Precedence (among themselves).\n\n(Clauses 41, 42.) At a festival when pichauris\u00b9 and betel are distributed, the chief Gancar takes first, and the others in order of their grade; and in calling the roll of names, the order of precedence is to be observed.\n\n(Clause 46.) At seed-time and at harvest, the first field to be taken in hand shall be that of the chief Gancar: and so with thatching the roofs with ollas (leaves of Borassus palm); the chief Gancar shall have his house thatched before the other houses.\n\n(Clause 47.) The dancing girls shall go first and perform (festeyar) before the house of the chief Gancar, and then before the others.\n\nGancars of equal rank are to receive betel, etc., standing side by side with their arms crossed so that the right hand of one may be below the left hand of the other: (then) if one says \"I received it with my right hand,\" the other will\n\n\u00b9 I cannot find this (Hindi) word in the Marathi dictionary: it means a small kerchief to cover the head, or scarf of honour.\nbe able to say, \"My left hand was held above your right\" [so that your right hand was not superior to mine].\u00b9\n\n(Clause 48.) As to Gancars who are 'in community' [i.e. an undivided family], so that, at a ceremony, there is no pre-eminence of one or other, they may sell the honour of precedence for the occasion, to any Gancar in the village, at a price agreed on; and the price shall be distributed in the village: if no one purchases the honour, the writer [Kulkarni] may take it in their stead and so save a dispute.\u00b2\n\nIII. The Status of the Villages.\n\n(Clause 2.) In the Goa territory there are 31 villages (a list is given); eight are placed at the head of the list, as \"these are the chief for their privileges and pre-eminence\" (B).\n\n(Clauses 43, 44.) When a formal resolution regarding some matter is come to by all the villages assembled, and the decision is written down by the 'writer,' a formal reading and confirmation is called 'Nemo.' This nemo is made by the chief headman present of the village Neura Kalan, because it is the chief village: in his absence the 'writer' makes it (C).\n\n(Clause 45.) The village of Taleigao has this pre-eminence, that it commences the rice harvest. The headmen carry a bundle of rice to present it at the High Altar of the Cathedral. [This association of the village with the religion of the conquerors is very curious.] The Vicar of the Cathedral after this function accompanies the headmen to\n\n\u00b9 As no Oriental would receive with his left hand, the explanation is confusing. What is perhaps meant is that, as the host-giver is one person, he must necessarily approach one of the two right hands first, and so seem to give one a preference; whereas by arranging that one of the right hands is in a position of some inferiority, the difference is ceremonially neutralized.\n\n\u00b2 In Colonel Sykes' account of the Dakhan Villages, he relates a case where the whole of the various privileges attaching to a headmanship had to be partitioned; and it was arranged (by a pancayat) that some of the honours or precedences should attach to one and some to the other sharers. In the above rule, if such a partition had not been made, and (say) three brothers were all Gancars by birth and so far equal, a solution of the difficulty is provided.\nthe Factory, and the Factor will spend 4 *pardaos* in pichauris, which he will put round the necks of the headmen: the other villages can then begin to cut their rice.\n\nIV. The Headmen's Duties in connection with the Revenue and the Cultivation.\n\n(Clause 3.) Each of the villages is bound to pay a certain rent (or revenue) as entered in a separate roll.\n\nThe headman assisted by the 'writer' will distribute and assign the amount among the cultivators and those having lands, according to their customs and conditions of this charter. The headmen are bound to distribute, collect, and pay the revenue or rent, whether it increases or decreases, and the loss or profit shall remain with them and with the village, in order that the persons may bear the loss or share in the profit, who by custom (as before set forth) are entitled. Loss occasioned by war they shall be exempt from accounting for, according to the proportion of loss sustained by each holder.\n\n(Clause 4.) The said profit and loss of each year shall be distributed, in proportion to each person's rent, on the palm or garden cultivation, or rice-land, which he holds (E).\n\n(Clause 5.) Certain 'gardens' [b\u0101gh\u0101it land of the modern Bombay system], palm-groves, and rice-lands are assessed to pay fixed sums, so that even if there be loss, they do not contribute to make it up. Other lands (of these kinds), though they are assessed at certain rates, yet are obliged to contribute further towards losses when there are any.\n\n1 The coinage is described in Mr. Whiteway's \"Rise of the Portuguese Power,\" p. 69. The *pardao* is valued at 360 reais, which at the time would have been worth rather more than 7s. 6d. If there were several headmen, perhaps as much as 30l. might be required to buy these scarves; but it is not probable that any such costly article was given.\n\n2 The distinction here, I think, is between the various holders of fixed or hereditary land and the cultivation of rice-lands (clause 20, post), who merely take the land at an auction for the year or harvest, or who otherwise have no hereditary holding.\n\n3 Apparently this is the *m\u0142adjamahandi*, so common in the Bombay territories, where the holder is (for one reason or another) allowed to have a fixed lump sum assessed, which does not alter under any circumstances.\nV. 'Watan' Grants for Village Service.\n\n(Clause 12.) Gancars can give rent-free lands, be they waste, or cultivated, but vacant, lands, to the village servants, i.e. the temple Brahman, the gate-keeper (porteiro), the 'rendeiro,'\u00b9 the washerman, cobbler, carpenter, blacksmith, temple-sweeper (faras = far\u0101sh), dancing girls, and the 'chocarreiro.'\u00b2 These persons get rent-free holdings of garden or other land as the recompense of their services. The grants are irrevocable, nor can any servant be removed and another man put in his place; for the servant is hereditary, and the grant is to him, his son, grandson, etc. Nor can servants be appointed other than the above-named, nor can they have free lands. Should such a grant lapse from failure of heirs, another man of the same profession must be put in to fill his place.\n\n(Clause 13.) Headmen cannot, without express orders, make a rent-free grant to any person not a resident of the village.\n\nVI. Disposition of Village Lands that are vacant.\n\n(Clause 9.) Headmen can grant land which is waste or fallow within the boundaries of their village to any applicant who wishes to cultivate vegetables ['garden' land] or\n\n\u00b9 Rendeiro in Portuguese may mean either one who receives, or one who pays, a rent or other charge or dues. I am unable to suggest definitely what person, regarded as one of the village staff, is meant. But it is quite possible that some 'bailiff' or other collector of the various imposts and levies was required (though not belonging to the original 'balute' staff), and so was put in and rewarded with a 'watan.' Such a person is alluded to in later documents as sacador, and it may be that the charter means the same thing by rendeiro.\n\n\u00b2 Chocarreiro means 'buffoon' or 'jester\u2014always implying jests of a low and coarse character.' So I am informed by an excellent Portuguese scholar at Lisbon.) I have never heard of any such person being one of the village staff. But the 'Mah\u0101r' (see J.R.A.S., April, 1897, p. 268) is constantly found; and in Marathi (according to Molesworth) the Mah\u0101r is often alluded to as 'Chokh\u0101m\u0101ja' (after the name of one of their tribal holy men). It seems to me possible that a Portuguese scribe hearing this word and not understanding it, may have put it down as 'Chocarreiro.' The Mah\u0101rs are always holders of watan land, and they are not otherwise mentioned in this list, though indispensable to the villages. There are generally several of them.\na grove, or for \"other profitable use.\" The grant is conditioned for the payment of such rent-rate as may seem fair [presumably a favourable or reduced rate] up to twenty-five years, after which the full customary rate will be payable. The customary rate is for each plot (grove) of twelve paces broad, that is, from palm-tree to palm-tree, up to one hundred trees; for the whole of it, five 'tanga' of four 'barganim' to the tanga (F). At this rate they pay for the extent, greater or less, of land held. The headmen may grant waste land to make a grove or garden for less than the rate of five tanga, but not for more; and may issue a written grant.\n\n(Clause 10.) Land granted to make a betel-garden will be given at the following rates:\u20145 cubits \u00d7 5 cubits (which is from one betel-vine to another) up to 100 plants: if irrigated by well, 4 barganim [i.e. 1 tanga] annually; if irrigated by running stream, 6 barganim [i.e. 1\u00bd tanga] (F).\n\nOnce granted, all such lands become hereditary possessions: this is the general rule, but if there is in any village some special custom in the matter, it will be given effect to.\n\n(Clause 20.) The rice-lands of each village, according to the custom, will be put up to auction and knocked down to the highest bidder; this does not apply to such lands when they are private property as heritable lands. The bidding is to be among residents of the village, unless any special custom allows non-residents to bid.\n\n[Bidding was, by custom, for many years, confined to headmen.]\n\n1 Apparently wet land (suited for rice) is not included, as that is disposed of in another way (clause 20, part). Apparently also the 'dry' crop of the Dukhan (jir\u0101t) is not known in the Goa climate; rice, vegetables, etc., palm-groves, and betel-gardens are the staple.\n\n2 These gardens for the aromatic leaf (betel) (Piper betle), used with areca-nut for chewing, can only be made in favourable soil and with careful irrigation. They are very profitable. The (climbing) plants are often protected overhead with mats.\n\n3 Low-lying and flooded lands only suited for rice, which is here the chief crop.\nVII. Failure of a whole Village.\n\n(Clause 6.) Should any village be so destroyed that it can no longer pay us the revenue assessed on it, the Gancars shall notify the 'Chief Th\u0101nad\u0101r' and the 'writer of the Island,' who will inquire into the causes of the failure; if they find it to be true, they will call the headmen of the eight principal villages. Other headmen may be present, but, by custom, the affairs of the Island lie with the headmen of the eight. To such an assembly, the headmen of the disabled village may relinquish the management. The eight must accept the charge as they are bound, and will put the village up to auction (in presence of the officials mentioned) and make it over to the highest bidder.\n\nThe deficiency [difference between the sum bid and the normal revenue] is to be made good by distributing the amount over the eight villages, or over the whole island, viz. on those properties which are liable to make good losses, in such way that the full amount of our revenue shall in any case be made good to us.\u00b9\n\nThe lessee or lessees of the village are bound to improve and restore the disabled lands during the term of their lease, and for this purpose they shall hold the office of Gancar.\n\n(Clause 7.) But the regular hereditary Gancars are not by this means permanently ousted; they must be restored whenever they ask for restitution and offer to pay the revenue-demand. When the lease has expired, the lessees have no further claim (D).\n\nVIII. Rules of Inheritance.\n\n(Clause 30.) The order of succession is from father to son and grandson, etc., and [failing the direct descending\n\n\u00b9 Nothing is said as to when 'the eight' and when the whole body of cultivators in the island (not holding free, or at any fixed rates) can be called on. Probably the headmen will decide, according to which gives the best prospect of making up the deficit.\nline] upwards to father, grandfather, etc. No female can inherit.\n\n(Clause 27.) If a man [however] has no sons, etc., his property will escheat to the Crown, and not go in the ascending line even if his father is alive; unless, indeed, the deceased was holding undivided with his father.\u00b9\n\nAmong sons the division is equal; if partition takes place in the father's lifetime, the father is entitled to maintenance.\n\nIf one son dies without heirs, his share lapses to the Crown, unless it is an undivided share, when it falls to the surviving co-sharers. A share of revenue-free land in any case lapses to the Crown (cf. clause 19). Should one of the brothers turn Mussulman or abandon the world and become a jogi, \"which is the same as the gipsies (ciganos)\" in Portugal (!), the property lapses to the Crown; but, if it is revenue-paying land, it will be sold and the private debts first discharged.\u00b2\n\n(Clauses 28, 29.) Need not be detailed; they contain the rule that where property will escheat to the Crown, the dead man cannot be buried or cremated (as the case may be) before the officials have notice, and that they may take account of the estate. The property is put up to sale by auction to the Guncars and relatives only. Some preference is given to the relatives (who consent to discharge the revenue liability). Clause 29 relates to moveable property (D).\n\n(Clause 32.) The principle of division when there are sons by two wives is, to divide per stirpes [= jorub\u0101nt in N.W. India, or q\u016bnd\u0101vand in the Panj\u0101b] and not per capita; [so that four sons of one wife would get one-half between them, and one son of the other wife the whole of the other share. This, Mr. Whiteway notes, was modified by a later order allowing either rule according to custom as established.]\n\n\u00b9 No notice is taken of the ordinary rule, that failing the downward or upward direct line, the collaterals come in, brothers and brothers' sons. These are thus disinherited by the rules, which claim everything for the Crown.\n\n\u00b2 See also clause 19 (which includes \"other persons\" as well as Guncars) regarding revenue-free land.\nIX. Rules about Alienation of Land.\n\n(Clause 15.) Should a Gancar or other person desire to sell any heritable property in the village, he must obtain the consent of all the Gancars of the village in question. And no one can purchase without similar permission.\n\nAny bargain made without such consent is ipso facto voidable, and can be set aside if the Gancars so desire in the interest of the revenue collection for which they are responsible. A purchaser is to receive a written slip, noting the revenue on the land bought, to save mistakes and discontent.\n\n(Clause 16.) It is not sufficient that the sellers of heritable property sign the deed of sale: all his heirs must sign also; and if one of them is a minor, there must be a consent signed by his guardian or next friend on his behalf.\n\nOmission of any necessary signature renders the transaction voidable at any time; but if a transaction is set aside, the purchase-money must be returned, though the purchaser will have no claim to be compensated for improvements he may already have effected.\n\nX. Rules of Procedure.\n\n(Clause 11.) The writer of the 'Camara' (Chamber or State Council?) of the Island, must be present at the passing and establishing, called 'Nemo,' of all agreements and resolutions such as are issued by the Chief Gancars of all the island together with the Chief Th\u0101nadar and writer, etc. Without the writer of the Island nothing can be done; for he takes note and assents to all, so that he may decide any doubts or question that may afterwards arise. In like manner [in a village matter] the village writer must be present. The writer's records (village books) regulate all the villages in the islands.\u00b9 I may\n\n\u00b9 \"The islands\" of old time territory are here (and elsewhere) mentioned as Preamar, Linsay, Church, and Jus. (See note to the Preamble.)\nadd to this that, by orders issued in 1735, the 'writer' (Escriv\u00e3o) was directed to enter the 'nemos' in consecutively paged books, under penalty of being whipped and banished for five years to Timor (equivalent to a sentence of death). The editor notes on this that the 'nemos' are often found recorded on loose sheets; the order defeated itself by its severity.\n\n(Clause 14.) When the chief officers summon a general meeting of Gancars in the Island, all must attend or at least get a local meeting to choose a deputy to appear in their stead. At such a local meeting (Gancaria) every Gancar must attend, or at least an heir of an absent member. The \"usual penalty\" will be exacted from anyone intentionally absent.\n\n(Clauses 22\u201326.) Are of less interest, having no direct relation to village constitution. They lay down rules of evidence: e.g., claims to immovable property must be supported by written evidence, confession of judgment, or by village records. If the latter are lost, there may be a solemn oath taken in the Temple of 'Uzoo.'\n\nMoney loans are next regulated. A larger sum than 50 tangas must not be lent except on a written bond. If otherwise, the parties may agree to refer the matter to \"two selected men\" for decision.\n\nInterest is allowed at one barganim for every six tangas. [One in 24, or a little over 4 per cent., if it is per annum; but more probably it is per mensem, in which case it is nearly 50 per cent.] (F.)\n\nBut interest can never be more than double the principal. [The other clause excludes, as do the Hindu law books, certain persons from giving evidence; among them children under 16, 'gardeners,' day-labourers, sons of a prostitute, variously defective persons: these, though incompetent in serious cases, may testify in minor ones.]\n\nWhat this means, I cannot ascertain. Mr. Whiteway has also been unable to interpret it.\nXI. Miscellaneous.\n\n(Clause 21.) The village headmen are liable to provide (unpaid) labour (beg\u0101ri) from any dwellers (pelos moradores) in the village, to clear away bushes and weeds from the city walls and 'caras' (ditches?), also \"to meet other necessities as occasion may arise.\"\n\n(Clauses 37, 38, 39.) The village must feed the Chief Th\u0101nad\u016br and his clerks, when visiting the place officially. Also \"our factor\" and his officials. Every 'peon' sent on official message is to be allowed (during his stay) two measures of rice daily and one real to buy betel.\n\n(Clause 34.) Officials must not take bribes, nor accept lands, nor trade within their jurisdiction, etc.\n\n(Clause 35.) Should the Gancar make any demands on the village for \"clothes or sweetmeats, or other benefits\" for himself or for any official or person, each Gancar will be liable to pay a sum equal to the whole demand from all the villages, and this sum by way of fine shall be given one half to the informer and the other half for the benefit of 'prisoners' (e a outra para os captivos). A village writer, if in the conspiracy to make the levy, shares in the penalty.\n\n(Clause 32.) Claims all treasure-trove for the Crown. (The Hindu law claims half) (D).\n\n(Clause 31.) Disposal of a man, who is a thief, caught with the stolen property in his possession, if he \"have an owner\" (i.e. is a slave), he is made over to his master\u2014by way of concession, \"though by use and custom he belongs to us.\"\n\n(Clause 49.) Use of the torch, palankeen, or umbrella, is a privilege requiring license of the Governor, unless it is an hereditary honour. When granted as an honour, the grant may either leave the grantee to employ his own\n\n---\n\n1 Mr. Whiteway kindly informs me that this means either the half is to go towards the fund for redeeming captives in the hands of 'the Moors' (a frequent provision), or else to help support the Goa prisoners, who depended on charity. The former is more probable, and the clause was perhaps slipped in at Lisbon, as an improvement on the original.\nservants and buy his own oil (for the torch), or may grant the oil and servants at cost of the State. Each emblem may be granted by itself\u2014or all together\u2014in either way.\n\nCommentary.\n\nGeneral Observations.\u2014The villages, throughout the Bombay country and the Dakhan, and Konkan generally, are in the raiyatw\u0101ri or 'severalty' form, marked by distinctive (and ancient) features, viz.: (i) The allotment of a separate (heritable) holding to every cultivating family (i.e. there is nothing in the nature of a unit estate or property shared in fractional proportions among a body of the same descent). (ii) It is marked by the existence of certain privileged holdings (watan) which are the reward of village service, or are also the special heritable property (along with rights of precedence) of the village officers in virtue of their position. (iii) By the influence and power of the headman (and his family). Such an officer has a real indigenous title in the local languages,\u00b9 and is quite unlike the modern and purely official representative called 'lambard\u0101r' in N.W. India.\n\nI make this observation because it is clear from every part of the Foral of 1526 that the villages (of the old Goa territory) therein described were then in the same form, and that every mark or feature of this constitution is mentioned. We shall afterwards see that the villages have since undergone a complete change.\n\nAs regards the Dakhan villages, I have already fully discussed\u00b2 the changes which were introduced by the dominating position (at an early but uncertain date) of\n\n\u00b9 The Marathi is P\u0101\u1e6d\u016b; G\u0101\u1e45k\u0101r (Karn). In other countries where the raiyatw\u0101ri form is indigenous, there are also many local names\u2014M\u0101\u1e0dhal, M\u0101nki, G\u0101\u1e45g\u0101l, etc., etc. In the modern term of joint-village or headman\u2014properly so-called\u2014exists, and there is no indigenous name or word. The (official) headman recognized by the administration is known either by the Arabic word mupuddam, introduced by the Muslim revenue officers, or by our (half-English) word lambar-d\u0101r (number-holder).\n\n\u00b2 J.R.A.S., April, 1897, p. 241 foll.\nsuperior families, the memory of whose possession was long preserved in the name 'mir\u0101si' land, which continued to attach to certain parts of the villages and which indicated a certain privileged tenure, and survived long after the old 'overlord,' co-sharing, families had disappeared. No change of this kind appears in the present case; no such special lands existed, as far as any indications in the Foral are concerned. Indeed, I doubt whether this Dakh\u0101n peculiarity, and the distinction of 'mir\u0101sd\u0101r' and 'upri' (common cultivator) extended so far south as (e.g.) the district of Belg\u0101m, which adjoins Goa. The distinction in the Goa villages was rather (at least in later times) between the mere contract-tenants put in by the managers, or auction-purchasers of the cultivating right in the rice lands for one harvest, and the permanent holders of heritable lands (kul\u0101c\u0101ri)\u2014a term which included both rent-payers and those who had rent-free lands ('watan,' etc.). (Kul\u0101 = a family paying revenue to Government.)\n\nIt was, I think, the conditions under which this group of villages grew up, as well as the Moslem system of revenue\u2014the worst features of which the rules preserve\u2014that prepared the way for the change which in later times came over these villages.\u00b9 I do not mean to suggest that we possess any detailed information of the earliest or pre-Mughal Moslem system. But the system described in the Foral certainly differed widely from that of the older Hindu\n\n\u00b9 It will be remembered that the Goa territory in question had been under 'Hindu' (Kadamba) kings of Banav\u0101si, up to A.D. 1312. Then for some 60 years it was under early Moslem rule; after that, Hindu rule (but under Vijayanagar) was restored till A.D. 1449; when Moslem supremacy, first under the united Dakh\u0101n kingdom, and then under the separate Bijapur ('\u0100dil Shahi') dynasty, was once more established. These are nothing to indicate that the villages of the 'Ilas' are very ancient; rather they seem to have been the result of a colonizing enterprise, headed by a few energetic men who founded the first villages. And we can fairly form some general idea of time which elapsed from the founding up to A.D. 1526, by allowing time for the increase of the first four or eight villages to the then existing number of 31. Nevertheless, the form of the village, as exhibited in the rules, is very much the same as that of the oldest 'raiaytaw\u0101ri' villages in Central and Western India that are traceable. The headman, the privileged holdings, and the revenue paid to the king, are features mentioned in inscriptions and literary references of unquestionably ancient date.\nkings, and in principle represents the Moslem plan. From all we know of the 'Hindu' kingdoms and overlordships (whether of Dravidian or of partly Aryan connection) it is certain that the royal revenue was derived from a share (in kind) of the grain produce of every holding or allotment (except certain privileged ones). The share (as such) was fixed by custom, and was not increased till comparatively late times, when rulers assumed the right to take such proportion as they appointed; and even then they sometimes tried to conceal the fact. In any case it depended on the harvest; it was a share of what was actually produced and no more. But the Muhammadan system (of the Dakhan Kings) had been in force about seventy-five years, of which the last ten or twelve before the Portuguese conquest represented the more defined and stricter system of the '\u0100dil Sh\u0101hi kings. This system, besides assessing the revenue-demand in money, created a liability for a total sum from each village, which before was unknown; and it accordingly must have given the headman so extensive a power of arranging this and that holding\u2014leasing this and charging that\u2014that in time, although the system never permitted the headmen actually to buy up or appropriate the holdings in their own right, every plot of land (except a few favoured with freehold or fixed rates) must have been so charged with levies and imposts, that its possession was more a burden than a profit.\n\n(A) The Portuguese form 'Gancar' in the text unquestionably refers to a governing and managing headman. It is true the Mar\u0101thi word, which is G\u0101n\u0331wkar (or G\u0101n\u0331wkar\u012b) means 'villager' in general; and Gooddine's Report (1852) mentions that in the Dakhan the term was applied to distinguish the (superior) holders of 'mir\u0101si' land as well as\n\n---\n\n1 As (e.g.) when the Vijayanagar minister insisted on having the share paid in husked rice instead of \"paddy,\" which of course largely increased the real payment without ostensibly altering the share.\nthe village headman; they were collectively denominated 'the G\u0101nwk\u0101r' or 'people of the village' par excellence.\\(^1\\) But Molesworth notes that from about where 'Malwan' is marked on the map, the word becomes used for the headmen only. This change is, I believe, explained by the fact that the area of the Konkani-Marathi language here merges into the territory where Kanarese is spoken, and in the latter G\u0101nwk\u0101r (with the long a) always means 'headman,' not 'villager.' It is this form that is represented by the Portuguese 'Gancar,' 'Gancares' (pl.).\n\nThe Foral of 1526 describes the 'headman' in all his original prominence, and with new powers. The word 'Gancar' does not (of course) etymologically mean 'governor' or anything of the kind; but practically that is what the headmen's function became, the 'Subjugator' of the village.\n\nThe account given in clause 1 is confessedly tentative; but there may have been some genuine old tradition that \"four men\"\u2014four brothers or associates\u2014started the original colonisation of the four islands (Tisw\u0101di, Diw\u0101di, Chor\u0101o, and Jua). If so, it is quite possible that eight villages, which we may suppose to have been the first fully equipped and separately constituted groups, had the pre-eminence (clause 2).\\(^2\\)\n\nThe headman's position, it will be observed, is made up of his special holding of watan land, his (m\u0101np\u0101n or) dignity and precedence, and his authority in the village. The whole together constitute, in fact, the watan. This is hereditary, and therefore becomes the property of the joint-family in the next succession. And the sons are all (at least called) G\u0101nwk\u0101r (or P\u0101til as the language may require). In the Pakh\u0101m we sometimes hear of each member of the family\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) J.R.A.S., April, 1897, p. 208.\n\n\\(^2\\) It is curious to remark in the Imperial Gazetteer (in the note on Goa compiled from Dr. J. N. da Fonseca's account) it is mentioned that when Albuquerque made his entry into Goa after the conquest (March 1st, 1510) \"eight leading men\" presented him with the keys. But all the early historians agree that these eight were Muhammadans, so that it could not refer to the 'Hannas.'\ntaking the duty of office for a period, in rotation. In other cases, where the area was sufficiently large, the sons might get the village made into sections, resulting in separate villages distinguished as 'Khurd' and 'Kal\u0101n' (or 'Budrukh'). This process was known as a 'tarfbandi' under the Moslems.\n\nIn the Foral (clause 2) we are told that the number of 'Gancares,' greater or less, was a matter of custom. That is to say, that though the Gancar family all had their share in the 'watan,' it would not follow that all would exercise the official functions of 'headman.' We are left, however, to conjecture whether the villages were divided into definite sections with one man (belonging to the family) over each; and whether that person was selected, as the eldest son of each principal branch from the ancestral founder, or how. It is evident (from the later papers) that the 'Gancares' did become very numerous, but there must have been some rule as to the limited number required to perform public duty and make the allotment of lands, etc. Probably the number existing at the time of the Foral which was known, but is not stated, was adhered to, in this respect.\n\nThe village writer (Kulkarni) is also alluded to as one of the village superiors. Here it is (more than once) said that he was originally appointed by the headmen, though the office once given became hereditary (and watanadar like others). In a case like this it is quite probable that the 'writers' were called in (with or without the local ruler's sanction) by the colonizers or founders of the villages, who would (under Hindu rule at any rate) enjoy considerable exemptions from taxation and much freedom. Ordinarily, we believe the 'writer' to have been introduced, rather by the king or his local officers, to look after his revenue collections.\n\n(B) Not only do we observe that eight villages are superior in rank, but two among the eight have some extra\n\n1 Cf. J.R.A.S., April, 1897, p. 254.\n2 Goa never knew Mah\u0101r\u0101tha rule, as the Dakhan did; had it done so, these headmen would probably have been repressed and not allowed to act in the way we shall afterwards see they did.\ndignity. The whole of the facts stated point to a strong probability, that we have here a case in which the traditional \"four men,\" or other small number of leaders, went forth with a party of colonists and set on foot an area of cultivation, which at first began with two, and soon resolved itself into eight villages, of which the leaders and their sons were the G\u0101nkwars. As time went on, fresh patches of cultivation, with their hamlets for residence, sprang up all round, and these in time attracted their own staff of artizans, and acquired a separate existence and place in the records. Thus (in the district originally comprised in the rules of 1526) there were 31 villages, all sprung, by extension and fission, from an original parent, or rather, a small number of parents.\n\n(C) I am not sure what this ceremonial reading out and writing down, of a general order or decision is. The Portuguese word *nemo* can hardly have anything to do with the Persian 'n\u0101ma'; I think it must refer to the Mar\u0101thi phrase 'nem (or niyam) l\u0101on\u0113,' which means 'finally to confirm,' 'set up' or 'establish' anything.\n\n(D) The various rules under the head of 'management' show how much the system has advanced in favour of the State Treasury; particularly the rule in the case of failure of a whole village strikes us as very harsh; for here the other villages, not the treasury, are to bear the loss, although they are in no wise to blame for it. Moreover, the rules of 'escheat' (on failure of heirs) have been largely extended to benefit the Government, and collateral succession is not recognized. Nothing of the kind was known to ancient custom.\n\n(E) The reader will probably fail to understand what can be meant by 'profit and loss' in the yearly revenue management. Ordinarily, where the revenue is assessed on\n\n---\n\n1 We are quite familiar with this process in Northern India, where the parent site is called khera, etc., and the offshoot villages, majr\u0101, garhi, etc. See my \"Indian Village Community\" Longmans, 1896), p. 276 foll.\n\n2 It is possible, however, that 'custom' may to some extent have justified the rule, if the villages, having developed out of an original central location, still regarded themselves as (in some sense) all one great village.\nthe whole village and properly distributed among the co-\nsharers (according to their constitution), as in North-Western\nIndia, the only question is of profit or loss to the cultivator\nor owner. And so in a Bombay raiyatwari village, every\nholding bears its own assessment. The State Revenue can\nbe no more than the sum of these assessments; and there\nis no question of profit or loss except to the cultivator\nhimself\u2014if the produce is so poor that it does not do more\nthan barely meet expenses, and pay the revenue.\n\nBut under the method recorded as 'customary' by the\nForal, the total amount which the 'Gancars' realize by the\nproper dues assessed on the several classes of heritable land\nmay not equal the total sum for which they are made\nresponsible by clause 4. In that case (saving only as\nregards loss due to war) the difference between the realized\namount and the required total has to be made good by\na surcharge, or further contribution demanded for such\nlands as are not expressly exempt. This may not, at once,\nbe clear.\n\nIt appears from the rules that the village lands include\n(1) Watan lands of the headmen, writer, and village\nservants; these do not pay any rent or revenue. (2) There\nmay be also other lands granted rent-free. (3) Also lands\nat a fixed assessment which does not vary, and there is no\nliability to any cess or surcharge. (4) There may be newly\nestablished fields, and vacant lands taken up (as arranged\nby the headman, clause 9), which, on the lease terms being\naccepted, become regular holdings. These are all 'heritable\nlands,' and are in effect private property. We gather from\nlater documents that these holders of land at fixed rates,\nor on any permanent tenure, were called 'culacharin,' i.e.\nkul\u0101\u00e7ari (Mar.), meaning 'rent-payers'\u2014those who have a\nfixed status (cf. Wilson, Gloss., s.v. kul\u0101). (5) But a large\narea of low-lying and flooded rice-land is included in each\nvillage (apart from any lands of this class that happen to\nbe private property), and this does not become the property\nof anyone in particular, but is put up in convenient lots to\nauction every year, so that the rents bid may be devoted\nto meeting the State Revenue-demand in the first instance. In fact, the sum thus realized is probably the sheet anchor. If prices are high and circumstances favourable, the rice-lands may fetch such a sum that, together with the rents due on other lands, the total may more than cover the State demand, and there is a 'profit' which is distributed by a return payment to the persons entitled. Sometimes it will be the case that the total obtained will not cover the State demand; then the holders of lands that are not revenue-free, or on absolutely fixed terms, must make up the loss pro rata. It will be observed that the total State revenue is not 'permanently' assessed; it may increase or decrease whether by the effect of a periodical reassessment, or revision of settlement, or otherwise.\n\nUnder the later Moslem Settlements in the Dakhan, this system was not pursued: there, the headmen were equally made responsible for a total sum, but when they could not get enough out of the village to make it up, they did not formally redistribute the deficit as these rules direct, but had to pay it themselves, and were allowed to collect an annual 'mush\u0101hara' or cash allowance, which (on the average) recouped them. It is hardly necessary to add that (under either system) great power is put into the hands of the headmen.\n\n(F) Clause 9 is interesting as showing that the tanga = \u1e6da\u1e45k\u0101 (Mar.) was a coin then in use. There is considerable confusion about the date, and the value, of the coins so called: the more so as 'tanga' is still used in Goa, but for a copper coin = 1/16 of the Goa rupee. In the latter case the word seems to be confused with '\u1e6dak\u0101,' used for copper coin generally. It is said by Grant Duff that the silver '\u1e6danka' was introduced in 1637 into the Dakhan, and into the Niz\u0101m Sh\u0101hi kingdom some twenty-seven years earlier. Here, however, we have a silver coin of this name in 1526. The \u1e6danka is variously given as either four or nine 'm\u0101sha' of silver (1 m\u0101sha = 13 to 17 grains). It\n\n1 Quoted, J.R.A.S., April, 1897, p. 269.\nis, however, clear that in the times of the Foral, the 'tanga' was a silver coin worth 60 reais or reis, and (at the then price of copper) was in value about sixteen pence. It consisted of four 'barganim,' which appears to be the (Hindi) b\u0101rak\u012bni. The old mediaeval \u1e6dank\u0101 of the Path\u0101n Empire was divided into fractions (k\u0101ni), of which one was \\( \\frac{1}{34} \\). And there were various small coins, one of which was the 'du\u012bzdh\u0101-k\u0101ni' (or bira-k\u0101ni), i.e. twelve sixty-fourths. This would be nearly \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of the \u1e6dank\u0101, or about 4d. in value. (See Yule & Burnell, Supplement to Glossary, s.v. bargani; and Mr. Whiteway's \"Rise of the Portuguese Power, etc.,\" p. 69.)\n\nLater History of the Villages.\n\nThere are a number of later documents, and some legislative enactments, which show, as I have already indicated, that these (originally raiyatw\u0101ri) villages have since undergone a great change. Obscure as are the details of the change, there can be no doubt as to its occurrence, or as to its general nature.\n\nIt will help to make the matter more intelligible if I call to mind the fact that in India we are quite familiar with historic alterations in the constitution of villages.\n\nTake for example the (very common) origin of 'pattid\u0101ri,' i.e. ancestrally-shared, villages in the North-West Provinces. They arose out of a transformation of an earlier community. There was once such a community\u2014no matter how constituted\u2014but enjoying a certain independence. But in the early days of British rule, when the idea of one landlord for each village or other estate was still prevalent, a revenue-farmer, or land-manager, got himself recognized, and was recorded, as the proprietor of the whole. In the course of some generations, his sons, grandsons, and great-grandsons, succeeding to the inheritance, made the village into shares; they became the founders of the 'patti,' 'thok,' and '\u1e6d\u016bla' divisions. Within these, the co-sharers gradually multiplied, set up their managing 'pa\u1e47\u1e0dayat,' and became the community\n\u2014the original body having sunk to being 'tenants,' and their constitution (whatever it was) having long disappeared.\n\nOr take another case\u2014of the reverse process. In the Th\u0101th\u0101ra T\u012bluka of the Kaira district (North Bombay), about the year A.D. 1483, the Sultan granted ninety square miles of land to a number of his soldiers who had distinguished themselves at the storming of a noted fort not far off. A certain number of 'village' groups were taken possession of, or newly established, in this area. At first, if we may judge from the name 'B\u0101rag\u0101m,' they were about twelve in number. These threw off hamlets in the usual way, and thus new villages developed. In all there were (in 1872) about twenty-seven. Originally they were held free of revenue; but the Mahr\u0101thas had subjected them to a full assessment, and so they continued. These villages were in fact (though it was not the Bombay custom so to recognize them) 'patid\u0101ri' villages, the descendants of the military grantees being the co-sharing owners (in fractional shares). At the Survey Settlement it was actually proposed to the communities that they should be (jointly) assessed at a lump sum for each village, they dividing the responsibility according to their own ancestral shares or constitutional method. But by that time the 'M\u0101lik's' (so they were called owing to the ownership originally granted them) had become so numerous, and the divided shares so small and in such poverty, that they feared the joint-responsibility and declined it. The Government officers then dealt wisely with the case; they allowed each 'house' to hold its 'gharkhed' or private family land (what we should call 's\u012br' in North-West India) revenue-free, and separately assessed and surveyed the other lands, making them 'raiayatw\u0101ri.'\n\n1 This, as a well-known fact, is the origin of a not inconsiderable number of villages (of this particular class) in the N.W.P.\n\n2 This shows how much revenue management depends on the character and customs of the people; liabilities cannot be created by administrative measures. And doubtless in Bombay the general prevalence of the raiyatw\u0101ri management served as an example to these villages, making them desire it. The poverty had been largely promoted by the exactions of the Mahr\u0101tha rulers and the Chief of Balas\u016bmar; but was also due to excessive subdivision of the land among the families.\neach holder having to pay the revenue direct to the local treasury. The only distinction was that (in virtue of their original superior position) the old proprietary families were granted a cash allowance (at a rate approximating to fifty per cent. on the assessment). Thus the 'M\u0101lik\u012b' tenure (as a special one) has disappeared; the villages became ordinary raiyatw\u0101r\u012b villages, only that certain families have a privilege in revenue-free (in\u0101m) lands, and a rentcharge or allowance (paid through the treasury) on the other (raiyat) holdings. I mention this case in some detail because in principle it represents just what ought to be done with the old Goa villages.\n\nIn the transformation which the villages of the Foral underwent, we have a greater complication. In the cases just stated the change is entirely intelligible because it directly refers to the shares or holdings in land, and to the consequent joint or separate liability for revenue. But in the Goa case, the land holdings, as such, were not affected. It was the rents and proceeds of land, not the land itself, that became the subject of the confused rights which appear at the present day.\n\nThe root of the mischief was (and perhaps still is) over assessment of the revenue, and the exaction of other dues besides. And this was aggravated by the fact that the whole revenue charge was made into one lump sum, and the headmen (according to their recognized number) were made jointly responsible to produce it somehow. It is true that the Foral declares this to be \"the custom.\" But it was certainly not the old custom of the village; it was the (arbitrary) 'custom' of the Bij\u0101pur Kings.\n\nNor can it for one moment be supposed that the revenue-demand was merely the aggregate of the properly adjusted, several assessments and lease-rents, duly allowing for rent and revenue-free lands, watan lands, and privileged holdings. It was a round sum arbitrarily made up, not of course entirely without reference to data, but in excess of any such total, because of the area of rice-land and other unappropriated holdings and waste land, which the headmen\nwere expected to bring under cultivation, if they were expert and diligent.\n\nBut in truth the revenue-demand was almost certainly liable to arbitrary increase by the harsh rules of 'escheat' and the limitation of rights of inheritance, which would cause lands bearing additional revenue to be put on the list from time to time. And we find that in 1541, the revenue- (and rent-)free grants of even the village servants were withdrawn! Moreover, from certain rules in 1735 we learn that the ecclesiastics had been in the habit of demanding tolls from the village under the name of 'alms' (emolus), and of imprisoning the villagers and distraining their goods to get payment. By the orders in question this custom was prohibited, but they show that it had long existed.\n\nUnder ordinary circumstances the extensive power thus put in the hands of the headmen would have made them de facto owners of all the village land, or at least have made all the holders (that were not rent-free) their subservient tenants. And this would have been followed by the headmen (as revenue-farmers) dividing the revenue-liability into definite (fractional) shares, and the village lands into corresponding shares. But it does not appear that any such stage actually developed. It is indeed necessary to suppose that the Gancars had some method of apportioning the revenue-responsibility among themselves\u2014either by taking fractional shares of the money total, or by allotting the area and each headman becoming responsible for the proportion of revenue that fell on his particular portion. Curiously, no mention is made of anything of this kind. Nevertheless it is certain that the Gancars had no power to sell the village lands, whether in the hands of 'culacharins' (p. 281) or otherwise. They devoted themselves, therefore, to getting the largest total proceeds from rents of leased lands, auction-rents of rice-lands, dues and levies from hereditary landholders, etc., etc. That such landholders remained in existence is certain, since 'culacharins' are mentioned in the latest papers.\nAs long as matters went tolerably well, these total proceeds (supplemented by others to be mentioned presently) would make a sum somewhat larger than the revenue-demand: at least there was always the hope that it would do so, or could be made by good management to do so. Consequently the headmen, either with a view of saving themselves trouble, or being under the necessity of raising money on the security of the future collections, began to sell shares in the prospective proceeds of the village to persons who were neither headmen, nor village residents, nor landholders. In one village, it is noted that one person bought up the whole of the income; in another, there were some hundreds of purchasers of shares in the proceeds, contending with as many Gancara.\n\nIn 1604 some ineffectual efforts were made to prevent such sales.\n\nThe purchasers of shares in the proceeds of land taxation were called 'cuntocar' = (I suppose) to kh\u016bntak\u0101r (Mar.). In Hindi, 'kh\u016bnt' means a share in land; but in Konkan-Marathi 'kh\u016bnta' means a 'peg'\u2014hence a lot or share marked out or defined for purposes of taxation.\n\nIt is almost impossible to explain further how these 'shares' arose or on what they are based. The Portuguese authorities give no clue: they speak of them as 'tanga shares,' or as we might say 'rupee shares.' In Northern India nothing is commoner than to find a whole village treated as 'one bigh\u0101' or 'one rupee,' and then the shares are expressed in the customary subdivisions in the scale of land-measure or of money as the case may be. Thus we have a 'biswa' share, or a 'four-ana' share, meaning in the one case $\\frac{1}{6}$ and in the other $\\frac{1}{4}$, and so on. This arose when people had no idea of the 'vulgar fractions' of our arithmetic.\n\nBut in Goa the 'shares' are certainly not fractions of land or rights in land: they appear, as I said, to be fractions of\n\n---\n\n1 Mr. Whiteway refers to the \"Oriente Conquistado,\" vol. i, 171; but the suggested explanation there offered is quite meaningless. Other writers frankly confess their ignorance.\nthe estimated or prospective income derivable either from certain specified divisions or plots or allotted claims (kh\u016bnta) of the village, or of the income derived from several different heads of collection.\\footnote{This is suggested by references to different kinds or classes of income, e.g., 'taxes de patos,' 'taxes de racy' (which latter is said to include certain items, no taxes, rent, etc.). It is impossible (and the dictionaries give no help) to find what either these distorted native or the Portuguese words mean. 'Gutta' (or tithe) in Marathi (by the way) means a monopoly or sale, for a fixed annual payment, of a right to certain variable amounts from a given source. 'Raxy' (habhi or habhi) might mean some tax levied for protection of the place against enemies.} Perhaps it is both. We know that in the Dakhan villages (under the Moslem system) there were two main heads of collections \u2014 (i) the various rents and cesses taken from the cultivated land-holdings (k\u0101l\u012b), and (ii) those taken from the village-site in connection with houses, shops, village trade, and export, etc. (p\u0101\u1e45\u1e0dhri). If something of the kind became customary in the Goa villages, it would be quite natural. And it is not difficult to imagine that the income from each main division might be again classified under various sub-heads and separately dealt with. The land-income would be that from the fixed rents of the kula\u00e7ari, from the auctioned rice-lands, from the vacant holdings, from the leased lands, and (very likely) from several imposts on the free lands. Thus the income under each head might be 'farmed' in (few or many) portions to as many 'sharers.' I only suggest this as possible under the circumstances of the case. Whatever, then, the nature of the 'cuntocar' or sharer's interest, there must soon have been an impasse. The 'sharer' had no control over the management of the cultivation or the arrangements for leasing lands, etc., from which his profit was to be derived; the 'gancar' had parted (bit by bit) with every vestige of the income he once derived from the lands (and other sources), which he was nevertheless alone empowered to manage. The landholder with his fixed rent, or his 'lease,' had nothing to say to either. Up to 1716, the collections under various heads (sic) were sold by auction to the Gancar (in the village) who made the highest\nA bailiff (seccador) was also appointed to go round and collect the actual payments; and he got the post (and might be an outsider) as the person who offered the lowest bid at auction, i.e. would accept the smallest personal remuneration for the work of collecting. In 1735 the orders (Cap. 3) permitted (at last) that the sharers should be allowed to bid at the (annual) auction, but (to save appearance of altering the rule) through a Gancar. Some further changes were made; but not till about 1850 were the 'sharers' allowed any voice in the management. When this was conceded, the 'headmen' as such, having nothing in the way of interest except in their hereditary holdings (and those perhaps much encumbered), ceased to have any distinctive position. In 1858 they petitioned that they might be restored to their former rights. Nothing, however, could be done, and they gradually dropped out of the records, the more recent papers containing no reference to them.\n\nDr. J. N. da Fonseca says expressly \"there are now no headmen.\" Meanwhile efforts were made to reconstitute some kind of 'community' out of the new material\u2014the 'sharers' and others, and the landholders who still had various interests. Some of the sharers held their right in the form of a share in the profits (whatever they might be) in the particular collection in which they had an interest. Others had been able to commute their interest to a cash pension of fixed amount; others held a 'lease' or farm (of certain items of collection) at a fixed sum in perpetuity.\n\nThe confusion was enough to puzzle the wisest administrator, and unfortunately the whole had been attempted to be regulated by orders which were drafted and dealt with by European lawyers who evidently possessed little or no knowledge of the village tenures and native customs.\n\n---\n\n1 He would then have to account to the various 'sharers' for the money each was entitled to; and if he was fortunate in his bid he would find the actual collections sufficient to satisfy the revenue and the sharers, and have a little over for himself.\n\n2 Evidently the 'sharers' had to be responsible for the revenue among themselves; or some official saw the revenue payment taken, before the 'sharers' were allowed to touch the balance.\nIn 1882 the curious experiment was tried of making (by law) the whole body of interested 'sharers' into a kind of joint-stock company. Some, who had fixed 'pensions' (in lieu of profits), retained them; all others had to commute their rights into a certain number of shares of Rs. 10 each (fractions not being allowed). Apparently over a large part of the village lands no separate possessory rights remained. The lands, or rather the dues leivable on them, were the 'capital' of the joint-stock association, who also owned all the ploughs and tools and cattle. I have not seen any details as to how the actual cultivation of the land was carried on, and what was the status of the persons who worked the fields, whether they paid annual rents or gave a share of the grain, or what. Presumably the rents and other dues of all kinds would be brought to account, the revenue charges first paid and the profits (if any) divided among the pensioners and shareholders.\n\nAs might be expected, this plan failed to work; and in 1897 permission was given for the desamortiza\u00e7\u00e3o (which I suppose means dissolution) of the joint-stock business, on a resolution of the 'sharers' being passed to that effect. In that case the villages were to be cadastrally surveyed, and the several holdings put up to auction.\n\nWe do not possess any details of how this is to be carried out, and it is of course too early to predict results.\n\nBut one thing may be confidently stated: the only possible foundation for a permanent arrangement is to restore the raiyatwari constitution, i.e. to make a careful cadastral survey, and to assess on every holding a proper revenue-demand, which it must pay, without any 'extras' and without any joint-liability. The best plan (if it were not thought impossible) would be to borrow from the Bombay Government (who alone possess the really competent staff) a good Settlement officer and body of experienced land classifiers to do the work.\n\nWhat with vacant holdings, the unappropriated rice-lands, the resumed grounds, and the encroached lands, the area actually held by hereditary cultivators (with a certain customary assessment to pay) must have become quite a minor portion of the whole area.\nThe question of the rights of the 'sharers' would have to be settled by commuting uncertain claims for a fixed amount, to be met either by taking over the hereditary right in the (vacant) holdings, or having a certain allowance paid through the treasury, the revenue-demand being adjusted on this supposition. Perhaps certain sharers might be recognized as 'superior occupants' entitled to a (defined) rentcharge on this or that holding or survey number. Thus the villages would return to being orderly 'raiyatw\u0101ri' villages, as they were at first. And perhaps some descendants of the old G\u0101\u1e47vk\u0101rs and Kulkarnis could again take office as headmen and accountants, under proper rules to prevent any right to the emoluments or to the authority becoming again shared among a number, or being frittered away or alienated.\nART. XII.\u2014The Story of the Death of the last Abbasid Caliph, from the Vatican MS. of Ibn-al-Fur\u00e2t. By G. Le Strange.\n\nAt the end of January of the year 1258 A.D., after a siege of more than a month, the Mongol army stormed and took possession of Baghdad; then, on or about the 18th of February following, the thirty-seventh and last Caliph of the House of Abbas, Al-Musta'sim-billah, was by order of H\u00fclag\u00fc put to death. Concerning the manner of his death the accounts differ; unfortunately there has come down to us no narrative by an eye-witness of these events, for the only really contemporary historian, the author of the Tabak\u00e2t-i-N\u00e2siri, was a native of India and wrote at Delhi.\n\nAbout the year 1300 A.D. three independent, but substantially identical, accounts of the death of the Caliph were made public in Europe, these being written severally by Marco Polo the Venetian, by Joinville the Frenchman, and by Hayton the Armenian (from whom Sir John Mandevill's notice is taken); and in all three we have the well-known story how the Caliph was starved to death surrounded by plates of gold,\u00b9 an account which has been further popularized by Longfellow in the poem of 'Kambalu.'\n\nFor purposes of comparison it may be convenient to quote this story as narrated by Hayton, whose work is perhaps less well known than that of either Marco Polo or Joinville. He was, it will be remembered, an Armenian baron who, about the year 1305 A.D., wearying of warfare and politics, left his native land, became a Premonstratensian\n\n\u00b9 Joinville merely says that the Caliph was shut up in an iron cage, but implies that he was finally left by H\u00fclag\u00fc to starve.\nmonk in Cyprus, and next journeying to Europe came to Avignon, where he was favourably received by Clement V. At the request of the Pope, Hayton composed and dictated his Oriental History: it was first written down in French (Les fleurs des hystoires de la terre Dorient), and a Latin version having been made from this, the work was presented to Clement V in 1307 A.D. About the year 1525 this 'Cronycle' was translated into English by Richard Pynson, and printed by him in a small folio, black-letter, for Edward Duke of Buckingham.\n\n\"And than Halcon commaunded that the Calyf with all his treasoure sholde be brought afore hym. And than he sayd to the Calyfe, 'Knowest thou nat that all this tresour was thyn?' and he answered 'Ye.' Than sayd Halcon unto hym, 'Wherefore dyde you make no good ordinance & prouysion for to defende your landes from oure power?' And than the Calyf answered hym, he thought that the olde women had ben suffycient to defende the lands. Than sayd Halcon to the Calyf of Baldach, 'Bycause that thou art maister and techer of Mahometz lawe, we shall make the fede of these preciouse tresour and richesses that thou hast loued so moche in thi lyfe.' And than Halcon commaunded that the Calyf sholde be put in a close chambre & that some of his tresour sholde be layd before hym, and that he sholde eate of it yf he wolde. And in the same maner the wretched Calyfe endede his lyfe, and neuer sythe was Calyfe in Baldache.\"\n\nJoinville and Marco Polo, as already said, in substance narrate this same story of how the Caliph was left to die surrounded by dishes of gold and gems; and in the veracious pages of Sir John Mandevill the account has become popular.\n\n---\n\n1 A copy of this rare book exists in the British Museum Library, and for the following transcript (beginning col. I, folio xv recto of the same) I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. A. G. Ellis, of the Department of Oriental MSS. in the British Museum, as also for the bibliographical notes given above. It is curious that until the middle of the present century the work of Hayton had not existed in his native Armenian language, so that the countrymen of the author during more than five centuries had to read the book in the old French or in one of the numerous European translations. In 1842, however, an Armenian version was made of this History of the Tartars, and printed at Venice, by the monks of the well-known Armenian convent on the Island of San Lazzaro.\nall the world over. This story appears also to be well known in other Armenian writers, but among Moslem historians it is rather conspicuous by its absence in their narratives of the destruction of the Caliphate by the Mongol hordes. Thus it is not to be found in the pages of the contemporary Tabak\u00e2t-i-N\u00e2s\u00eer\u00ee (1260 A.D.), nor is the story mentioned by Abu-l-Faraj (1286), Fakhri (1360), Rashid-ad-Din (1300), Hamd Allah Mastawf\u00ee (1330), Ibn Khald\u00fbn (1380), or Suy\u00fbt\u00ee (1500). In so far as I am aware the earliest allusion to the story by any Moslem author is that to be found in the pages of Wass\u00e2f, who, about the year 1300, wrote in Persian a verbose and extremely rhetorical history of the early Mongol sovereigns of Persia. Wass\u00e2f, in most flowery Persian, interspersed with Arabic couplets, makes a long story, which is to the effect that after Musta\u1e63im had surrendered Baghdad, the Mongols placed gold coins before the hungry Caliph on a dish, and when he declined eating them, an interpreter by order of H\u00fbl\u00e2g\u00fb reproached him for crass folly in not having spent some of this useless wealth in raising troops to defend his capital. Then, according to Wass\u00e2f (and all the Moslem authors agree in this), instead of being starved to death, the Caliph was, by order of H\u00fbl\u00e2g\u00fb, rolled in a carpet and trampled on until life was extinct, the shedding of his blood being thus avoided.\n\nIn the catalogue of Oriental MSS. in the Vienna Imperial Library, compiled in 1865 by Professor Fl\u00fcgel, a notice will be found (vol. ii, p. 46, No. 814) of a voluminous chronicle composed by Ibn-al-Fur\u00e2t, who died at Cairo in 807 (1404 A.D.). Nine volumes of this chronicle exist at\n\n---\n\n1 G. Weil in his Geschichte der Chalifen makes no mention of the anecdote, nor does Sir W. Muir, who follows him. Major Price in his Muhammadan Dynasties (ii, p. 221) gives the story as reported by the late authority of Khw\u00e2nd-amar in the History of the Mongols.\n\n2 Geschichte Wass\u00e2fs, Vorz\u00fcglich herausgegeben und Deutsch \u00fcbersetzt, by Hammer-Purgstall, Vienna, 1836, pp. 77\u20139 of the text and 75\u20136 of the translation. This Persian account is reproduced from Wass\u00e2f, without acknowledgment, by both Mirkhw\u00e2nd writing about the year 1500 A.D. (Khv\u00e2nd-amir, Bombay lithographed edition of 1266 A.H., part v, p. 78) and by Khw\u00e2nd-amar some thirty years later (Q\u00e2lib-as-Siy\u00e2r, Bombay lithographed edition of 1271 A.H., part iii, section 1, p. 56).\nThe Vatican MS. has already been examined by Angelo Mai under the No. 726 catalogue. It has been bound up in the Vatican library throughout, and contains the years from 839 not 633 as stated in the catalogue. This fact is especially noted in details of the Vatican MS., which has already been examined by Mai under the No. 726 catalogue.\n\nIt is evident that the Vatican MS. contains a description of the Fortresses of Jerusalem, which have frequently changed hands. From time to time again, an examination of these places was made during the Crusades.\n\nThe Caliph Al-Hakim (died in 1021 A.D.), and, therefore, although\n\nI am obliged to Mr. H. F. Amedroz, to whom I am indebted for his kindness in sending me his transcript\nIbn-al-Fur\u0101t must have written his chronicle fully a century after the sack of Baghdad by H\u016bl\u0101g\u016b, he may very well have met in Cairo, at the court of the Egyptian Abbasids, those whose fathers or grandfathers had originally fled to Cairo from Baghdad at the time of the death of Musta'sim. Be that as it may, his account of the Mongol siege of Baghdad, though lacking in exact topographical details, is full of anecdotes of the last Caliph and his advisers; also we here get (so far as I know), for the first time in an Arabic chronicle, the story of Musta'sim, left fainting for lack of food, being surrounded by dishes of gold and gems.\n\nAfter narrating the chief events of the siege (Vatican MS. cited above, ff. 190a-195b)\u2014and Ibn-al-Fur\u0101t mentions nothing that is not well-known from the writings of Rash\u012bd-ad-D\u012bn and other writers more nearly contemporary than himself\u2014our author proceeds to state that in the first month of the year 656 the city of Baghdad was finally stormed, and the Caliph with his sons having surrendered, these were brought out and lodged in a tent within the lines of the Mongol camp. An anecdote is next given, at some length, about a certain white bird that came to roost on the tent where the Caliph was imprisoned, and what Musta'sim replied to H\u016bl\u0101g\u016b's enquiries on the subject of the said bird: this though edifying from a Moslem point of view is quite devoid of historical interest, and so need not be quoted. The story of the death of the Caliph is then given, and the following is a translation of the text (f. 196b):\n\n\"Then H\u016bl\u0101g\u016b gave command, and the Caliph was left a-hungering, until his case was that of very great hunger, so that he called asking that somewhat might be given him to eat. And the accursed H\u016bl\u0101g\u016b sent for a dish with gold therein, and a dish with silver therein, and a dish with gems, and ordered these all to be set before the Caliph al Musta'sim, saying to him, 'Eat these.' But the Caliph made answer, 'These be not fit for eating.' Then said H\u016bl\u0101g\u016b: 'Since thou didst so well know that these be not fit for eating, why didst thou make a store thereof? With part thereof thou mightest have sent gifts to propitiate...\"\nus, and with part thou shouldst have raised an army to serve thee and defend thyself against us.' And H\u00fcl\u00e2g\u00fb commanded them to take forth the Caliph and his son to a place without the camp, and they were here bound and put into two great sacks, being afterwards trampled under foot till they both died\u2014the mercy of Allah be upon them.\"\n\nTo explain the more immediate cause of the order for execution, Ibn-al-Fur\u00e2t gives another account, narrating how the Caliph and his son Abu Bakr were brought before H\u00fcl\u00e2g\u00fb, who rising to his feet seated the Caliph very honourably beside him on the throne, Abu Bakr standing near by as his father's chamberlain. Now the young man was not as humble by temperament as was the Caliph, and when H\u00fcl\u00e2g\u00fb began publicly to reproach Musta's\u00eem for not having taken steps in time to ward off the evil that had now come on his people and his religion\u2014as (said H\u00fcl\u00e2g\u00fb) a true king of the Moslems should have done\u2014the youth Abu Bakr lost patience, and crying out, \"Is it for thee, O enemy of Allah, thus to browbeat the Commander of the Faithful?\" forthwith spat in the face of H\u00fcl\u00e2g\u00fb. On which the Mongol chief, naturally becoming wrath, ordered both his prisoners off to execution, which, says Ibn-al-Fur\u00e2t, according to one account was carried into effect by strangling.\n\nA general massacre of the inhabitants of Baghdad followed, lasting 34 days, or some say as long as 40 days (ff. 196a, 197a), and the Mongols then set fire to the capital. The number of the slain is reported to have been in excess of 2,330,000; and H\u00fcl\u00e2g\u00fb was only dissuaded from the complete annihilation of Baghdad and its people by the advice of his general Kitbugh\u00e2, who pointed out that if some of the population were not spared, money and provisions for the Mongol army could not be collected, whereby\n\n1 The name of the Mongol chief is generally given by Ibn-al-Fur\u00e2t under the usual Arabic form of Hul\u00e2k\u00fb for H\u00fcl\u00e2g\u00fb; in this anecdote, however, the name is spelt Hul\u00e2w\u00fbn or Hul\u00e2w\u00fbn, which I believe is unusual in Arabic or Persian authors.\ngreat loss of wealth in the future would thus ensue. On which H\u00fclag\u00fc ordered the flames to be extinguished, and granted quarter to all those of the inhabitants who were still left alive (f. 200a, b). Various anecdotes are then given by Ibn-al-Fur\u00e2t. One, at some length (f. 201a), relates how a company of Fak\u012brs, theological students and men of the Kh\u0101nik\u0101hs (Moslem convents), all dressed in white assembled on the Bridge of boats at Baghdad just as H\u00fclag\u00fc was departing, and proceeded to devote themselves to death, by martyrdom, seeing that their master the Commander of the Faithful had already thus suffered. Twice over H\u00fclag\u00fc sent his chamberlain to dissuade them, telling them that by order of the great Kaan, Changiz Kh\u0101n, non-combatants were to be spared, and so bidding them go their ways in peace. They insisted, however, that death was unavoidable, and that martyrdom was most desirable at the hands of those who had slain their Caliph. Whereupon, the chamberlain having returned with their second answer, the chronicler adds that H\u00fclag\u00fc \u201csmiling ordered them all to be slain, and they were shot to death with arrows, the mercy of Allah be upon them.\u201d\n\nIt may be mentioned that Ibn-al-Fur\u00e2t cites a number of contradictory notices (f. 198a, b) as to the exact date of the putting to death of Musta\u1e63im, a matter on which certainty is unattainable, and indeed is of no great importance. Further, in the account of the plundering of Baghdad Ibn-al-Fur\u00e2t states (f. 196b) that H\u00fclag\u00fc sent for the Staff and Mantle of the Prophet Mu\u1e25ammad (which then existed, it would seem, in the treasury of the Caliph), and ordered these both to be burnt in a dish (tab\u0101k), their ashes being subsequently thrown into the Tigris. According to the chronicler, the Mongol chief did not on this occasion act from mere impiety. \u201cFor (said he) I have not burnt these regarding them as of no importance, nay rather I have burnt them to keep them undefiled, since none now hath the right to wear the Mantle or to carry the Staff; and even I, according to our law, am also not fit to make use of either of these things.\u201d\nThis presumably was after the death of the Caliph, and if the anecdote be true it would appear somewhat to invalidate the authenticity of the Staff and Mantle of the Prophet, now preserved at Stamboul, which is used at the inauguration of every new Ottoman Sultan, who, as all know, claims to be the true Commander of the Faithful. Perhaps, however, it may be that the Prophet Muhammad left behind him more than one Staff and Mantle for the edification of true believers, and the proper use of his Caliph and Vicegerent, whether he may live at Constantinople, Cairo, or Baghdad.\nART. XIII.\u2014Contributions to the History of Ahikar and Nadan. By M. Gaster.\n\nThe history of Ahikar and his nephew Nadan forms part of Eastern popular literature. When publishing my history of Roumanian popular literature seventeen years ago (Bucuresti, 1883) I devoted a special chapter to the Roumanian versions of this history (pp. 104\u2013114). I was the first to recognize the connection between the Roumanian and Slavonic versions and those contained in the Arabian Nights. I then drew attention to the intimate relation between this legend and that which has entered the Greek life of \u00c6sop. Since that time scholars have paid much attention to this legend, especially as through Meissner's studies it is being considered as one of the lost Apocrypha mentioned already in the Book of Tobit.\n\nThe whole material has now been collected under the title \"The Story of Ahikar, from the Syriac, Arabic, Armenian, Ethiopic, Greek, and Slavonic versions, by F. O. Conybeare, J. Rendel Harris, and Agnes Smith Lewis. London, 1898.\" In the Introduction (pp. vii\u2013lxxxviii) the attempt is made to reconstruct the old Hebrew form of Ahikar, especially in Chapters V and VI. Before examining this hypothesis, and many of the points touched upon in that Introduction, I will first give a direct contribution to the text itself by translating the Roumanian version. I have selected for this purpose, out of a number of manuscripts mentioned by me in my History of Roumanian Literature (\"Grundriss der Romanischen Philologie,\" ed. Groeber), ii, 3, p. 387, the version contained in my manuscript No. 90, written 1777.\nThe Roumanian Version.\n\nThe History of Arkirie, the very wise, who taught his nephew Nadan in matters of wisdom and learning, that he should have sense and philosophy and good knowledge.\n\nIn the days of King Sanagriptu there lived in the land of Rodu (Doru) a man named Arkirie. This very wise Arkirie adopted a nephew, the son of his sister, of the name of Anadan (for he had no children). He fed him with white bread and honey and good wine, and taught him philosophy. And he said to him:\n\n1. \"My son, I teach thee first: Enter into no business with the mighty, nor buy anything from them, nor buy stolen goods, lest thy own goods perish with them.\n\n2. \"My son Anadan, honour thy father and thy mother, so that they should not curse thee, and let thy goods remain blessed and thou eat and rejoice in them (cf. Akyr. 25).\"\n\n3. \"My son Anadan, when thou servest a wicked master, do not tell him that he is wicked and that he should have mercy on thee, but do what he orders thee.\n\n4. \"My son, do not talk in the presence of thy master, for thou wilt err and he will hate thee.\n\n5. \"My son Anadan, go to church on each holiday, and on Sundays, for God will feed thee (cf. Akyr. 33).\n\n6. \"My son Anadan, wherever thou seest a man sad and in sorrow crying, go to him and comfort him, and remind him that he will also die (cf. Akyr. 41).\n\n7. \"My son, when thou reachest a high position, then bow before everyone, for with thy wisdom thou wilt reach a higher place still.\n\n8. \"Be not hasty in thine anger lest thou repent afterwards (cf. Akyr. 97).\n\n9. \"My son Anadan, whatever thou wishest to obtain from God, pray continually, for in time God will grant it to thee.\n\n1 The references in parentheses are to the Slavonic version in the above publication of Conybeare, etc.\n10. \"My son, keep thy hand from theft; do not murder, and do not speak evil (cf. Akyr. 119).\n\n11. \"My son Anadan, flee from unchastity, especially from married women, for thou wilt lose thy head (cf. Akyr. 119).\n\n12. \"My son, listen to the wise man, though he be poor, for that is the way in which God acts; one day he gives to one and the other day to the other.\n\n13. \"As long as thou livest, beware from digging a pit for others, for thou art sure to fall in it.\n\n14. \"A wise man listens (to words), but the fool, even when thou strikest him, will never learn anything (cf. Akyr. 49).\n\n15. \"My son Anadan, take no bribes, for bribes blind the soul and make thee lose it, and darken the eyes of man (cf. Akyr. 53).\n\n16. \"My son, better be served by a righteous slave than by a wicked brother (cf. Akyr. 61).\n\n17. \"It is better to lie on the gridiron than to live with a wicked wife, and do not confide thy advice and thy faith to anyone (cf. Akyr. 68).\n\n18. \"My son Anadan, when thou speakest to thy master let thy mouth be locked with three locks\u2014one on the heart, and the other on the mind, and the third on the mouth\u2014for when thou once hast spoken, the word cannot be caught back either on horse, or by wind hounds, or by the hawk.\n\n19. \"Again, my son Anadan, honour and support the good and the wise, though he be only wise in his way and not rich.\n\n20. \"My son Anadan, if thou hast a wicked neighbour do not neglect him, for God will have mercy upon thee, and he will not be able to harm thee.\n\n21. \"My son Anadan, be not a liar, for a lie first goes to the bottom as heavy as lead, and at last it floats like a leaf on the water (cf. Akyr. 74).\n\n22. \"My son, it is better to carry stones with the wise than to feast with a fool.\"\n23. \"My son, honour thy brothers and thy friends, lest he speaks nicely in thy presence, but behind thy back he will hurt thee and smite thee.\n\n24. \"My son, if anyone throws stones at thee, throw bread, for the bread will come back to thee and the stone will return to him who throws it.\n\n25. \"My son, it is better that a wise man beats thee than that the fool honours thee.\n\n26. \"My son, when thou sittest at other peoples' table do not sit high up, for other people and greater people will come and move thee to a lower place; but when thou sittest at a lower end, and when once they have called thee up, they will no more move thee down.\n\n27. \"Nor shalt thou invite anyone to a stranger's table.\n\n28. \"Do not sit too long; better sit a little and let them regret that thou dost not tarry longer.\n\n29. \"When thou art invited come properly dressed, otherwise better stay at home and let them regret thy absence, instead of going unprepared, for he wishes to honour thee, and thou puttest him to shame.\n\n30. \"My son, do not go out in the night without arms, for thou knowest not whom thou shalt meet.\n\n31. \"My son, when thou startest on a journey, carry thy own food with thee, and count not on that of thy companions, for thou wilt remain hungry (cf. Akyr. 78).\n\n32. \"My son, do not start alone on a journey, and on the way do not eat all thy food, relying upon thy companion, for when thy food comes to an end he will not give thee; (for fruit in a stranger's sack get easily bad and rancid).\n\n33. \"My son, if anyone give thee good advice listen to it, for it will be very useful to thee; it will be like fresh water from a pure fountain to a thirsty man.\n\n34. \"My son, do not go to other tables uninvited, and\n\n35. \"What thou dost not like for thyself do it not unto others.\n\n36. \"My son Anadan, take care of the top of the sack and not of the bottom, for the bottom is also the end.\"\nWhen he had instructed him in all the philosophy and wisdom and knowledge, Arkirie took his nephew Anadan and brought him to the King Sanagriptu. Bringing him to Court, Arkirie said: \"Honourable King, I will present my nephew Anadan that he serve your Majesty, for I have grown old, and am not able to serve any longer.\" And the King Sanagriptu, in reply, said: \"I am very pleased to fulfil your wish, Arkirie.\" And Arkirie said unto the King: \"May it be thy gracious will to appoint my nephew Great Logothet.\" And he was appointed to that post, and it went well with him, and he was greatly honoured at Court.\n\nBut Anadan harboured evil thoughts in his heart, and he thought how he could destroy his uncle Arkirie, so that he should get all his property. So he wrote a false letter without the knowledge of the King, and he wrote as follows: \"I, Anadan, in the name of the illustrious king Sanagriptu, send greetings and good health to my beloved friend and father, the wise Arkirie. The moment when thou receivest this letter assemble the warriors from that part of the country and come as fast as thou canst, for the king is in great trouble.\" When Arkirie read this letter he at once gathered his hosts, and started to go with all his hosts to the King. When Anadan knew that his uncle had approached the place, he took the king by the hand and led him to a high tower and showed him the army. The king was greatly astounded, and said: \"What can this mean?\" Then Anadan said: \"There is my uncle Arkirie, who has risen in rebellion against thee.\" And the king said: \"What am I to do to save myself from this great danger?\" And Anadan said: \"When he will have come much nearer I will go out and meet him, and with good words I will persuade him to come with me, and I will bring him to thee.\" And the king said: \"If thou bringest him, there will be no one greater than thee in this realm.\" And the king said, \"Go.\"\n\nAnd Anadan then went and said: \"Greetings to Arkirie, to my father, welcome in health. The king is waiting for thee, for he is oppressed with dangers from many quarters.\"\nAnd he said: \"Greetings unto thee, my son\u2014how is it well with him?\" And Arkirie answered: \"He is in great troubles, and he wishes to see him as quickly as possible.\" And Arkirie went to his master. So he got up and went to see him as a personal servant, not knowing anything. He came before the king with his uncle, and the king said: \"Is it right that thou shalt come with hosts against me? My mother and I have been kind to thee, and thou hast done me no harm in the kingdom, and now thou desirest to kill me, but instead of that thy punishment shall be visited upon thee.\" Arkirie replied: \"I know nothing of this.\" The king replied: \"Why hast thou acted in this manner against me?\" And the king said to his executioner: \"Now shall we punish him according to his crimes.\" No one of them answered, but Amadan said: \"The punishment shall be that his head be struck off and that his body be thrown away from his body.\" And the executioner said: \"So and cut his head off.\"\n\nThen Amadan said: \"Remember the words of the Lord, and I pray unto the Lord that he may send him Arkirie back again.\" So they sat down and wept over him. Then the executioner said: \"Take him away, and let him go.\" So they brought him away. They sat down and wept over him. Then the executioner said: \"Take him away, and let him go.\" So they brought him away. There is a man who will willingly bring his head and bring it to me. He complied willingly with his request, took his head and returned to his underground dwelling in his\nhouse, and there he lived for nine years, no one knowing anything of it with the exception of his wife. Anadan asked now from the king the houses and property that belonged to Arkirie his uncle. The king gave them to him. He went to the house of his uncle, and he began to beat the servants and slaves, and he held great feasts and dances over the grave of his uncle. And many other such things. Arkirie heard all this and suffered.\n\nIn another country there lived a king by name Pharaon. When he heard that Arkirie, the philosopher, had been killed, he sent a messenger to Annagriptu (i. Sanagriptu), saying: \"I bid thee know, that the moment thou seest this my letter, thou shalt send me some workmen, for I wish to build a castle which shall be neither in heaven nor upon earth, and these workmen shall come, neither walking on foot nor riding on horseback; they shall be neither dressed nor naked. If thou wilt not do as I wish, then gather thy hosts for battle.\" When Sanagriptu saw this letter he was greatly disturbed and wondered how to do it, for he had no one to counsel him, and he said to his counsellors: \"If Arkirie had been alive, I should have had some one to advise me, but you have caused me to kill him, and now I am sure to lose my country.\" And all the counsellors were greatly vexed and wondered what to do. Then the executioner said: \"O illustrious king, if anyone would bring Arkirie back alive, what wouldst thou do to him?\" And the king replied: \"There shall be no greater man than him in my whole kingdom.\" So he went and brought Arkirie from his underground cell. When they brought him out, his hair reached to the ground, and his nails were like scythes, and his eyes were closed, for the hair of his lashes and eyebrows covered them completely; and they brought him to the king.\n\nWhen the king perceived him he greatly rejoiced, and said: \"O Arkirie, what am I to do, as the king Pharaon has sent a missive asking me to send master-workmen to build a castle which shall be neither in heaven nor upon earth, and those masters shall be neither dressed nor naked,\nand they shall come neither on foot nor on horseback.\" Arkirie replied: \"Be comforted, O king, and rejoice, for I will accomplish this thing, but give me ten days grace until I shall have recovered the sight of my eyes.\" The king granted his wish, and after the ten days Arkirie came to the king and asked him to give him two eaglets. He took these eaglets with him and entered a boat, taking the master-workmen with him dressed in fisher-nets, and so they came to the king Pharaon.\n\nWhen they reached the place the king did not recognize him, and he asked them, \"How did you come?\" And Arkirie replied: \"Neither on foot nor on horseback, and now, Pharaon, be ready for to-morrow.\" On the second day Arkirie took a boy and put him in a high bedstead (a cage), and he tied the two eaglets to that bedstead, and the two eaglets began to fly aloft, for the boy kept in his hands an iron spit with meat on the top of it. He showed it to them as if he were willing to feed them, and the eaglets were very hungry, as they had been kept for three days without food. The boy then cried: \"Bring lime and stones, for the workmen are ready, and we wish to build the castle in the heights\u2014neither in heaven nor upon earth.\" And Arkirie said unto the king: \"Give orders to the people to carry up lime and stones, as the workmen are waiting for work.\" The king wondered at it, and he said: \"In truth we are at fault now, as we cannot carry up the lime and stones.\"\n\nThe king then recognized that it was Arkirie, and he said unto him: \"I want you to make me a rope of sand.\" Arkirie went and bored a hole through the wall of a room, and in the morning when the sun rose the rays of the sun penetrated the room through that hole, and Arkirie said to the king: \"Send and tie the foals up quickly with that rope, so that I may twist another.\" And the king wondered and said, \"Thou art truly the philosopher Arkirie!\" and he said unto him, \"I am it\"; and he told him all that had happened to him, and how his nephew had spoken evil against him.\nHe returned then from that place, and came back and made obeisance to the king, and said: \"I wish you to deliver up to me my nephew Anadan that I teach him my philosophy, for I have hitherto not taught him sufficiently well.\" And the king said, \"Go and take him.\" And he got hold of him by the chest and brought him to his house.\n\nAnd he made four iron staffs and four clubs of wood with nails sticking out of them, and he put Anadan down and began to beat him. And Anadan said: \"Forgive me, my father, and let me be the meanest of swineherds, only let me live.\" But Arkirie said: \"No, my son, thou hast acted towards me in the same manner as the wolf acted when he went to the teacher to be taught; for whilst the teacher said A B C D the wolf said: 'For the lambs' and 'for the sheep' and 'for the goats' and 'for the kids'; in the same manner hast thou acted towards me, my son.\"\n\nAnd he began to beat him. And Anadan said: \"Have mercy on me, and I will be a shepherd.\" And Arkirie said: \"Thou hast acted towards me as the wolf who followed the sheep and met the shepherd, who said to him: 'Happy journey to thee, wolf.' The wolf replied: 'Thank thee.' And he asked him: 'Whither art thou going so fast?' And the wolf said: 'I follow the track of the sheep, for an old woman had told me that the dust of the sheep was wholesome for the eyes.' In the same manner hast thou acted against me.\"\n\nAnd he began again to beat him, but Anadan said: \"Have pity on me, and I will groom thy horses.\" But Arkirie said: \"No, my son, thou hast acted towards me like a man who, leading an ass on the road, tied it with a loose rope. The ass broke the rope and ran away. On his way he met the wolf, and the wolf said unto him: 'Happy journey unto thee, ass!' And the ass replied: 'Unhappy it will be, for the man tied me up with a rotten rope, so that I broke it and ran away, and he did not tie me with a good rope.'\" And Arkirie continued to beat him until he died.\nThus far the Roumanian version in this manuscript, which is distinguished by some peculiar features from all the other versions known. Whilst some of the riddles are omitted like that of the Peculiar Tree, we have here, on the contrary, more details concerning the master-workmen which had to be sent to Egypt. The source for this text is probably Slavonic, but here again the differences are very marked between this version and that published by Jagic and reprinted in the English translation in the above-mentioned book (pp. 1\u201323). The proverbs and maxims are less numerous than in the Slavonic, and a large number are missing altogether from the Slavonic. The Roumanian text thus reveals a much more primitive form of this legend in the Slavonic, or maybe in the Greek original, than has hitherto come to light. The incident connected with the flying of the boy in the cage or bedstead is here also much fuller than in the Slavonic text, and presents striking resemblance to the ancient Solomon legends with which this part of the history is undoubtedly connected.\n\nNor should it be forgotten that this text is merely one out of a number of similar texts, of which I have given a short description in my book on Roumanian Popular Literature, and recently in my History of Roumanian Literature in Grober's \"Grundriss der Romanischen Philologie,\" ii, 3, p. 387. Although all these MSS., and the printed texts published by Anton Pann (1842) rest ultimately upon one Slavonic or Greek original, yet there is no absolute identity among them. Each text differs from the other, either through the omission of some minor incidents and similes at the end of the tale or in the maxims and sentences, of which one contains a larger, the other a smaller number, and some again have new maxims inserted which are missing in other versions. These changes are sometimes radical, and yet they have evidently taken place within the last two or three centuries, as none of these MSS. is older than the eighteenth century.\n\nThe fact that even in one literature, and within a comparatively short period, profound changes have been\nintroduced into it, is of no mean importance for the history of this tale. Similar changes have undoubtedly occurred also in the other versions of Ahikar, and it is more than doubtful whether we have in the versions that have come down to us, all of a comparatively recent origin, the old and primitive form of the \"Ahikar\" legend. The process of continual change is not limited to one period or to one circle alone. This is the rule for all popular books, and any conclusions that are derived solely from one or more versions, or even from all combined, must fall short of the truth so long as this factor is being ignored. In this change only the frame, i.e. the history of the hero, remains as a rule the abiding factor. The incidents are either amplified or altered according to the fancy of the copyist, and according to his greater or smaller amount of knowledge. The most fluctuant element is the gnomic\u2014the maxims and proverbs that float about, as it were, in the air, and are eagerly caught up by the scribes to popularize the tale with the listeners for whom it is intended. These bear the imprint of the immediate environments; for they must have the local colour if they are to be retained by the copyist or translator. The figurative element will live longest in the East, the pregnant antithese will be appreciated everywhere.\n\nI do not intend discussing here the history of the European proverbs. It suffices to point out the profound change which has taken place in the Greek proverbs. The Byzantine and modern Greek differ from the old not merely in form, but in tendency, as Krumbacher has convincingly shown. They resemble much more the Oriental conceptions and are also of a figurative character. In fact, they are identical with the Ahikar type, which in its turn resembles the old Hebrew 'mashal,' the maxims of the Books of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Sirach. The Oriental proverbs have in their transmission from the East to the West a history of their own. Mutual borrowing can be followed up here no less clearly than in the case of tales and apologues. This branch of comparative folklore has, however, as yet scarcely\nbeen touched upon in spite of the great work of Wander and others. How far the East, and in speaking of it in this connection I limit myself to the Christian and Muhammedan East\u2014is indebted to the West, i.e. Greece, and vice versa, can only be matter of conjecture. In each country scores of witty sayings will have crystallized at one time or another round one prominent figure renowned for sharpness of wit and keenness of spirit. Collections of such proverbs have then been transferred from the one to the other. The similarity in many an incident and in a good number of maxims between Solomon, Ahikar, \u00c6sop, and Logman, is due to these causes of identification and adaptation from one local hero to the other. In fact, the bulk of the final portion is taken over bodily from the old cycle of Solomonic legends and adapted to the Ahikar cycle. The same has happened to individual maxims and proverbs. The route they take is not easy to follow. One single example must suffice to show how such maxims have come from the West to the East, to be enriched and amplified there, and to begin a new journey through the length and breadth of Europe.\n\nIt will at the same time disclose the true origin of the Ethiopic collection, which the editors do not seem to realize. Honein b. Isaac translated in the ninth century from various languages\u2014Greek, Syriac, and Hebrew\u2014into Arabic a large collection of such maxims. It has deeply influenced European and also Oriental paroemiology. In the eleventh century already it was translated into Hebrew, and about the same time or a century later into Spanish. It forms the basis of Mubashir's collection, which in its turn is the basis of the Spanish \"Bocados de Oro,\" translated then into French and English, not to speak of other translations dependent on either of these compilations (v. Steinschneider, \"\u00dcbersetzungen,\" p. 348 ff.). Among the component parts of Honein's collection we find also the so-called \"Will of Logman\" and a goodly number of parallels to Ahikar. Steinschneider maintains now that the Ethiopic text is borrowed from this compilation, and thus the theory of the\neditors, who believed in an independent Ethiopic version of Ahikar, falls to the ground.\n\nIn this transmission from literature to literature the links are often missing. Parallelism is not sufficient proof for determining the possible priority of one text over another. Nor is it by any means clear, because in some versions of the Book of Tobit, Aheiahros and Nadan, and only the ingratitude of the latter, are mentioned, that it refers to the story in the form in which it has been transmitted. In the short reference to him in Tobit, not a single allusion is made to the teaching and to the maxims of Ahikar. I see in the 'story' of Ahikar the combination of two independent sets of tales. The first part of the tale\u2014the adoption of Nadan and the treason of the latter\u2014is one independent tale, whilst the 'wisdom' of Ahikar is another, and it has been amalgamated with the former at a later period. The first is known only in connection with Ahikar and Nadan, no other name having ever been substituted for either.\n\nThere is no parallel known to this tale in any other quarter. Wherever this tale occurs it is always associated with the same names\u2014copyists' errors in one of the Greek texts of Tobit notwithstanding. Not so, however, with the second part, containing Ahikar's journey to Egypt for the purpose of solving some riddles set by the king to the master of Ahikar, and the successful accomplishment of his task. The very same incidents occur in the life of \u00c6sop, and Loqman has been credited with identical exploits. But all these are merely the late reflexes of older cycles of legends clustering round the name of Solomon, the oldest embodiment of Oriental wisdom. The Queen of Sheba puts such riddles to him, according to ancient legends; they recur also in the recital of the riddles put to the same king by Hiram of Phoenicia. He is also flying through the air in the same manner as the boy in the legend of Ahikar. This legend has afterwards been transferred to Alexander the Great. All these ancient sages are also credited with great wisdom, and the 'Will' or last ethical exhortation is the concluding portion of the narrative in each case.\nI see, therefore, in this part of the Ahikar legend, which is common to so many reputed wise men, an older and at the same time an independent part of it. The same applies for many of the maxims and ethical principles put into the mouth of Ahikar. Their source must be sought in the collections connected with names, such as Solomon, \u00c6sop, etc. Very much depended on the translator or copyists of the 'story.' They played often the r\u00f4le of authors, altering, omitting, and introducing such maxims as suited them best. Many a popular proverb has thus been introduced which was of a totally different origin. The one would favour Biblical reminiscences, the other look to the Qor\u00e1n for inspiration, and a good many to other collections of proverbs and maxims.\n\nHow numerous such collections, e.g. of Greek proverbs and maxims, have been can be gathered from the very rich bibliography recently published by G. Polites in connection with his publication of the Neo-Greek proverbs. Such proverbs were easily taken over by another and incorporated into his work, to be borrowed anew from the latter by a third compiler, and so forth. To give again a modern example. Negrutzi published in 1852 a collection of Roumanian proverbs, into which he had incorporated verbatim almost the whole of the maxims of 'Arkirie' without even mentioning him! Pann, again, introduced other popular proverbs into his second and subsequent editions of Arkirie!\n\nI adduce these examples because we can verify the sources. In the light of proven facts we are justified to assume similar procedures for ancient times, and we thus learn to guard against rash conclusions drawn from similarity between maxims or between single similes and incidents.\n\nIt needs hardly pointing out that under such circumstances, before formulating any opinion as to the age and origin of the Ahikar legend, the first thing to be done is to try and establish the primitive form. All the MSS. containing the story of Ahikar are of comparatively modern origin. They differ among themselves very much, and show undoubted traces of early indebtedness to the Bible in its widest\nsense, and to many extraneous collections of maxims and apophthegms. An attempt to reconstruct a problematic Hebrew original is, to say the least, premature; and the attempt to penetrate behind the modern form with the intention of finding a book contemporary with the Psalter or with the Gospel narrative, as made in the Introduction, is not warranted by any of the facts hitherto adduced to strengthen this hypothesis.\n\nI must dwell at some length on this point and on the relation which is presumed to exist between Ahikar and Tobit. Much is made in the Introduction, p. xlviii ff., of the sentence that occurs in Tobit, iv, 10\u2014\"Alms doth deliver from death\"\u2014and the editor labours to prove the possibility that in an older form much of the almsgiving of Ahikar may have been mentioned, but which is now missing. The difficulty is to be met, then, by the identification of 'righteousness' and 'alms,' both expressed by the Hebrew word 'sedaqah.' He takes pains to explain the advice of Tobit by means of finding also in Ahikar \"a suggestion of a confusion between 'righteousness' and 'alms.'\" The passage in Tobit is, however, merely borrowed verbatim from Proverbs, x, 2, or xi, 4, in which we find the same words repeated twice: \"but righteousness delivereth from death.\" In my edition of the Hebrew Tobit this very verse is found agreeing verbatim with Prov. xi, 4, thus dispelling any lingering doubt. This quotation has since become a popular Hebrew proverb, exactly with the same meaning as in Tobit and in Ahikar, 'alms' taking the place of 'righteousness.' This change in the meaning of the Biblical proverb is due to the change of the meaning in the word 'sedaqah' which has taken place in post-Biblical times. The Rabbinic literature abounds with reference to 'almagiving,' and the regular word for it is only 'sedaqah.' With this derivate meaning the word entered the Qor\u0101n. Its appearance with that meaning among the sayings of Tobit, and especially among the maxims of Ahikar, proves with absolute certainty its late origin. The change had already taken place, and the proverb had become popular with the altered meaning\nattached to it. Even now the sentence is written on the poor-box among the Jews, and it is repeated on occasions of burial, when the people are appealed to to give \u2018alms,\u2019 for \u201calms deliver from death.\u201d\u00b9 There is nothing in it, therefore, that should \u201crefer to the experience of Ahikar,\u201d as is maintained in the Introduction, p. liv, and no doubt can be entertained that the borrowing is entirely on the side of Ahikar.\n\nTurning now to the parallels to the Psalms as given on p. lvii, the following sentence from Ahikar is considered to be parallel to Psalm cxli, 4:\u2014Ahikar: \u201cO my son, be not neighbour to the fool, and eat not bread with him.\u201d Psalm: \u201cIncline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity, and let me not eat of their dainties.\u201d Much nearer, at any rate, is the following quotation from Proverbs, xxiii, 6: \u201cEat thou not bread with him that hath an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainties.\u201d It is significant that the next translation of Ahikar agrees apparently better with the Greek version than with the extremely difficult Hebrew original. Much more interesting is the third example adduced by the editors. Ahikar: \u201cFor he who digs a pit for his brother shall fall into it; and he who sets traps shall be caught in them.\u201d This is said to be a parallel to Psalm cxli, 10: \u201cLet the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape.\u201d It has \u2018escaped\u2019 the editors that we have in Ahikar merely the transcript of Psalm vii, 15: \u201cHe that makes a pit and digs it, falleth into the ditch which he has made.\u201d\n\nThese few examples show that, far from the Psalms \u201ccontaining an actual memorial of Ahikar,\u201d the very reverse has taken place. The sentences in Ahikar proclaim their youth by the form in which biblical reminiscences are found among them. The question may now be asked whether the references to Aheiaharos in the Greek versions of Tobit belong to the original form of that text? The oldest Hebrew version extant (published by me) has no\n\n\u00b9 v. Tendlau, \u201cSpruchw\u00f6rter Deutseh-juedischer Vorzeit,\u201d No. 858.\nreference whatsoever to Aheiaharos or to Nadan; and the Text of Jerome, which stands in close relation to this old Hebrew, has only one solitary allusion to this name. This is probably due to the influence of the Old Latin utilized by Jerome, which in its turn represents that Greek tradition which is found also in the Peshitto. Ilgen already in his commentary to Tobit pointed out that the two passages in which Aheiaharos occurs are probably due to a late interpolation. They interrupt the flow of the tale, and must therefore be of a different origin, introduced, as I believe, into the tale of Tobit in order to strengthen the moral weight of the ethical teaching contained in the 'Will' of Tobit.\n\nAll this tends to diminish the probability of a Hebrew original of the story of Ahikar, readily assumed by the editors. Not a single trace of the first part of Ahikar has thus far been found in the Hebrew literature. Numerous parallels to the second part exist, as remarked above, but they are independent of Ahikar; though a far larger number of parallels to the maxims can be found in Hebrew than those few given by the editors.\n\nHebrew paroemiology offers a vast material, which has hitherto not yet been utilized. The comparisons should not be limited merely to such coincidences which find their reason and explanation in the fact that they derive from the Bible, which is a source common to both. There are other collections in which parallels to Ahikar will be found. But which is the primitive source? An answer to this question must be reserved until a complete translation of some of the more important collections will have been published by me, especially of those that go under the name and authority of Judah the Prince, Eliezer the Great, and \"The Canopy of Elijah\" ascribed to Elijah.\n\nIn most of these collections the sayings are arranged in numerical groups exactly in the manner in which they appear at the close of Ahikar's teaching, which undoubtedly is an imitation of those old 'Wills.' Such groups are found also massed at the end of a book called \"The Sayings of\nthe Fathers,\u201d by Rabbi Nathan, an extremely old compilation, dating probably from the fifth century. We find thus the following saying in \u201cMaaseh Torah,\u201d ascribed to R. Judah, sub No. 4: \u201cThe sages say the following four sentences: \u2018The fool will then become wise when a black man rubbing with a sack will become white; the young will then be possessed of knowledge when the ass will walk up a ladder; the daughter-in-law will live peacefully with her mother-in-law when the kids will dwell peacefully among tigers; and when a white raven will be found then also a woman without blemish\u2019\u201d (cf. Akyr., No. 82; Khik., No. 83; Ahik., No. 62; Haiq., No. 59).\n\nFrom the Will of Elieser the Great: \u201cMy son, do not talk idle talk in the school-house, do not scoff at everything, do not scoff at everybody\u201d (cf. Khik., No. 57).\n\n\u201cMy son, honour the poor and assist him secretly, feed him in thy house, and turn thine eye away when he eats and drinks, for he is hungry and would leave off eating\u201d (cf. Akyr. 81).\n\n\u201cMy son, do not reveal thy secret to thy wife, be faithful and true to all; do not reveal thy secret to thy friend when thou art contending with him no more than when thou art at peace with him\u201d (cf. Akyr. 68. 75; Haiq. 53; Khik. 59. 74).\n\n\u201cMy son, do not cook in thy neighbour\u2019s pot (euphemism for \u2018do not marry a widow\u2019)\u201d (v. Khik. 40).\n\n\u201cBe patient in anger\u201d (Akyr. 97).\n\n\u201cMy son, do not be without children, teach them the Law\u201d (cf. Ahik. 28; Haiq. 28; Khik. 20. 35).\n\n\u201cMy son, do not wander about alone, nor be alone a judge, or judge and witness in one\u201d (cf. Ahik. 27. 56; Akyr. 27; Haiq. 27; Khik. 19).\n\n\u201cMy son, be not a neighbour to the wicked, and do not associate with the slanderer\u201d; and \u201cMy son, do not sit in the company of the slanderers and of the evil-tongued\u201d (cf. Haiq. 19; Khik. 90).\n\n\u201cMy son, rejoice not when thy enemy falls, lest God sees it and it displeases Him\u201d (cf. Ahik. 17. 60; Khik. 11. 97; Haiq. 58).\n\"My son, beware of a woman that is not worthy of thee, for she is sure to ruin thee\" (cf. Akyr. 15; Ahik. 19.72; Khik. 13; Haiq. 8).\n\n\"My son, love the wise and run after them, know thy Maker, live in peace with everyone, and speak the truth\" (cf. Ahik. 12.31; Khik. 6.89; Haiq. 14).\n\nThese few examples suffice to show that many more parallels could be found in Rabbinic literature, though this parallelism proves very little for the Hebrew origin of Ahikar.\nART. XIV.\u2014On an Ancient Block-print from Khotan. By A. F. Rudolf Hoernle, Ph.D., C.I.E. With two Plates.\n\nIn December last I received from Captain H. H. P. Deasy a small cylindrical box containing a block-print, which, as he wrote to me from Yarkand in April, 1899, he had obtained, apparently, not long previously in Khotan.\n\nIn general appearance the box (see Plate I) much resembles one which belongs to the British Collection of Central Asian Antiquities, and which I have described in my Official Report. (See Journal, Asiatic Society of Bengal, Extra-Number for 1899, p. 108 and pl. xv). Captain Deasy's box is rather larger. Its measurements are: height, 7\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)\"; diameter at mouth, externally 4\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)\", internally 3\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\\")\"; thickness of wall, \\(\\frac{3}{8}\\\"); diameter at bottom, externally 5\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)\", internally 4\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\", the wall sloping slightly upwards; thickness of projecting figures, \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)\". It is made of wood, and turned out of one piece. The wall is cracked in two places, close to each other, one crack extending right from top to bottom. All edges are rounded off; there is nothing sharp-cornered in the whole box. Round the bottom of it there runs a band, projecting 1\" and about 1\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)\" high, incised with an inscription which runs round three-quarters of the circumference, just avoiding, fortunately, the two cracks, which go through the blank one-fourth. On this band, as on a platform, there stands out, from a countersunk surface, a row of eleven rudely carved human figures, placed close together, and just filling the whole of the circumference. They only\ndiffer in the arrangement of their arms, which is as follows, beginning on the right of the longer crack:\n\nThe first, fourth, and eighth men have their arms hanging straight down.\n\nThe second and tenth men hold their hands over their stomach, the (proper) right above the left.\n\nThe third holds them similarly, but the (proper) left above the right.\n\nThe fifth, seventh, and ninth have their (proper) right hand placed on the stomach, and their left arm hanging down straight.\n\nThe sixth holds himself similarly, only reversed, the left hand on the stomach and the right arm hanging down.\n\nThe eleventh has only one arm, the (proper) left, which hangs down straight. There is nothing to show that the eleventh figure ever had a second arm; the second (shorter) crack runs up, from the bottom of the box, to its neck, through the countersunk space upon which the missing arm would have stood; but there is no mark of any fracture to be seen.\n\nThe cranium of the second, seventh, and ninth figures is marked with parallel incisions to indicate hair. On the remainder of the figures these marks are omitted, the cranium being left quite smooth, like the rest of the body of all the figures. The bottom of the head of the second figure is marked with similar strokes to indicate a beard.\n\nOver the heads of these figures, there is a series of five roughly circular knobs, with a diameter of about $1\\frac{1}{8}$\". They are placed, at equal distances, above and between the heads of figures 1 and 2, 3 and 4, 5 and 6, 7 and 8, 9 and 10. Above the eleventh figure, there is no knob. Accordingly there is a longer blank interval, of about $4\"$,\nin the countersunk space, between the fifth and first knobs, corresponding exactly to the blank interval in the band below the figures, where there is no inscription.\n\nThe faces of the knobs are carved as follows: No. 1 with an inscription, Nos. 2\u20134 with human features, and No. 5 with the device or monogram (shown in Plate I, fig. 2) which is also found in certain pages of the block-print book. The lower part of the face on No. 4 is also marked with strokes to indicate a beard; these are wanting on the two other faces.\n\nThe box has no lid, nor does it appear to have ever had any. It is a regular copse.\n\nThe long inscription (Plate I, fig. 4) at the bottom of the box consists of fifteen (or perhaps sixteen) words, written in characters which resemble Uigur.\n\nThe short inscription on the knob, written in the same characters, and apparently consisting of four words, is shown on Plate I, fig. 3. The device on the knob is shown in the same Plate, fig. 2, also on Plate II, fig. 11.\n\nThe block-print measures $8 \\times 5\\frac{1}{2}$ inches. The lines run parallel with the narrower side, and there are from nine to nineteen lines on a page, though the usual number varies between twelve and sixteen. They also vary very much in length, and are often printed disorderly, both in point of direction (being out of parallel) and interval. The material is paper, of the same kind as that on which the books and rolls of the Ninth Set of the British Collection are printed. (See my Report, pp. 47, 109, 110.) It is a very thin, almost transparent, tough paper, of even texture, and of a yellowish or creamy tint. The first leaf is torn in two; of four other leaves (Nos. 5, 44, 45, and 70) about one-quarter is torn away and missing. Altogether there are seventy-two leaves, all separate; therefore 144 pages. Printing commences on the second and ends on the last page. There is, however, inside the book a page, the 44th, which is blank; and it is, therefore, probable that the leaf to which it belongs, the 23rd (= pp. 43 and 44), originally formed, or was intended to form, the end of the book, and has only been misplaced\nin binding the book. For one would naturally suppose the book to commence and end with a blank page, as is the case with the similar books of the Ninth Set of the British Collection. The book is bound with three stitches, along one of its narrow sides, so that it opens like a European book. The material used in stitching is thickly crusted with muddy sand. It is either a skein of thread, or a squashed piece of split reed or of some other fibrous plant. In many places the book is almost illegible. This is partly owing to the circumstance that all the leaves are covered with a very thin muddy layer of fine sand, in which the book with its box had evidently been buried for a long time. The sand can be washed off; when this is done, the print, which is made with an indelible ink, is seen more distinctly. But the print itself in many places is very indistinct, the reason apparently being that on account of the extreme tenuity of the paper the type-block was only applied to it with the lightest of pressure to prevent the impression showing through on the reverse, the result of which was that the finer lines of the type often did not ink the paper. On the other hand, occasionally the pressure was so strong that the outlines of the type are not only blotched on the right side, but show through on the wrong side of the paper.\n\nAs the text consists of formulas which are repeated over and over again, it is possible by a careful comparison to determine, with much probability, the correct form of each symbol. It is in this way that the facsimiles, which are shown in Plate II, have been prepared by me with the help of tracing-paper.\n\nThe text printed in the book consists of fifteen lines, as shown in that Plate. Of these, *prima facie*, lines 1\u201312 present the same script, while lines 13 to 15 appear to be in a different script. Accordingly there would seem to be two different scripts represented in the book.\n\nLines 1 and 2, 3 and 4, 5 and 6, 7 and 8, 9 and 10 are always found printed in conjunction, except when occasionally a line stands by itself near the margin of a page, and where evidently the companion line is simply omitted for want\nof space. These lines, accordingly, form pairs, each of which constitutes a separate formula. The two lines, 11 and 12, do not form a pair; they are always printed separately: thus, on p. 18, line 11 is printed six times along with lines 1 and 2 (i.e., with formula i); and on p. 95, line 12 is printed five times, along with line 13, also five times. The three lines, 13\u201315, also, are always printed separately. Accordingly the five lines, 11\u201315, constitute five different formulas. Altogether, therefore, the fifteen lines make up, between them, ten separate formulas.\n\nFrom this circumstance it may be assumed that the text of the book is printed from ten separate type-blocks, one block for each of the ten formulas. This conclusion is confirmed by the fact that the symbols which constitute the double-lined formulas i to v always stand in exactly the same relative position to one another, as I have ascertained by measuring the intervals between the lines of a pair as well as those between the several symbols of each line with a pair of compasses. It is clear, therefore, that there must have been five blocks, carrying each two lines of type, and five other blocks, each carrying only one line of type. That no single page is printed from one single block, is apparent from the fact that the arrangement of the lines (or formulas) is not alike on any two pages. The following are typical cases to illustrate the apparently planless way of distribution of the formulas over the pages:\u2014\n### Table I\n\n| No. of Formulae | Lines of Formulae | Lines on Page | Total Lines on Page |\n|-----------------|------------------|--------------|--------------------|\n| 1               | 14               | 120          |                    |\n| 2               | 15               | 122          |                    |\n| 3               | 16               | 128          |                    |\n| 4               | 17               | 110          |                    |\n| 5               | 18               | 25           |                    |\n| 6               | 19               | 102          |                    |\n| 7               | 20               | 132          |                    |\n| 8               | 21               | 16           |                    |\n| 9               | 22               | 77           |                    |\n| 10              | 23               | 67           |                    |\n| 11              | 24               | 60           |                    |\n\nNote: The table lists the number of formulae, lines of formulae, lines on page, and total lines on page for each entry.\nAll the ten formulas are never printed on any single page. The highest number that I have noticed on any page is eight, and the lowest, one: see pp. 60 and 120 in the preceding table. Between those two extremes the number constantly varies. There is only one other page in the book which contains but one formula, viz. p. 92, and it is again the eighth formula (l. 13) which is there given. There are only six pages (2, 6, 18, 57, 89, 96) which give only two formulas, viz., formulas iv and vi, or iv and ix, or vi and viii, or vii and viii, or viii and x. I have noticed only one page with eight formulas, viz. p. 120, which gives formulas i, ii, v, vi, vii, viii, ix, x; and there seem to be only three pages (111, 122, 128) which contain seven formulas, viz., formulas i, iv, vi\u2013x, or ii\u2013iv and vii\u2013x, or i, iv, vi\u2013viii and x. The formulas which occur most frequently are Nos. iv (ll. 7, 8), vi (l. 11), vii (l. 12), viii (l. 13), ix (l. 14), and x (l. 15). Formulas ii (ll. 3, 4) and v (ll. 9, 10) are found very exceptionally; the former occurs only fourteen times, the latter only twelve times, in the whole book. Formulas i (ll. 1, 2) and iii (ll. 5, 6) are also of rather rare occurrence; the former is found twenty-three, the latter forty-two, times. Formulas vi\u2013x are peculiar to Captain Deasy's book; so is the monogram or device (Plate II, fig. 11) which appears on a certain number of pages. None of these is found either in the two books or in the two rolls which are comprised in the British Collection, and which are described in my Official Report as constituting the Ninth Set of block-prints. Those four documents contain only the formulas i\u2013v, there denoted ix\u00b9, ix\u00b2, ix\u00b3, ix\u2074, and ix\u2075. They are shown in photo-etched facsimile on plate xvi of my Report, but unfortunately they can be seen only very indistinctly. They are shown much better in the Plate accompanying the present note, which is prepared from inked tracings on transparent paper.\n\nThe device (Plate II, fig. 11) is found on twenty-two pages, printed in different places on the page, as shown in the following list, in which the places are defined with reference to the inner margin of the page adjoining the binding. It\noccurs in the left lower corner twelve times, viz., on pp. 6, 16, 24, 48, 58, 60, 62, 107; 114, 119, 123, 132, and in the right lower corner, twice, on pp. 98 and 108, and in the right upper corner, once, on p. 48. In the remaining cases, viz., on pp. 7, 17, 25, 36, 37, 69, 100, it is placed in the middle of the page; that is to say, on p. 17 it stands in the centre of the page, on p. 7 in the middle of the left-hand margin, and on pp. 25, 36, 69, and 100 in the middle of the bottom margin, while on p. 37 it occurs four times, side by side, along the bottom margin; in fact, seeing that the left-hand corner of p. 37 is torn away, it may have here stood five times. There is no system apparent either with regard to the number or the place. But it is quite possible that the leaves do not stand in their original order in the existing book; one leaf certainly does not stand any longer in its proper order;\u2014what is now the twenty-second leaf (pp. 43 and 44) must, as I have already pointed out, have once stood at the end of the book; and it may be noted that its printed side, p. 43, is marked with the device. It is not impossible, therefore, that originally the position of the device may have followed some sort of serial order.\n\nThe device has some resemblance to one shown on plate iii, fig. 76, of my Official Report on the British Collection. The latter belongs to a signet ring, and is made up of four countersunk svastikas placed diagonally. One diagonal pair turns to the right, the other to the left; and the two pairs join their central arms, thus:\n\n```\n  +---+\n /     \\\n|       |\n \\     /\n   +---+\n```\n\nThe lines of the first and second formulas measure $2\\frac{1}{4}$\", and as the width of the page is $5\\frac{1}{2}$\", it admits rather more than two impressions of the formulas, placed side by side. As a rule, there is no margin whatever. Thus a line of the page might consist, e.g., of two full impressions of the first line of the first formula plus a portion (say one-third) of a third impression. A similar remark applies to formulas\nix and x, which measure about $1\\frac{3}{8}$\", and of which nearly three complete impressions go to one line of the page. The formulas iii and v measure about $3\\frac{4}{5}$\", and of these one full impression and about one-half of a second go to a line of the page. It is nearly the same with formulas vii and viii, which measure $4\\frac{1}{2}$\" and $3\\frac{3}{4}$\" respectively. Formula iv measures $4\\frac{3}{4}$\", and it only admits one full impression and two symbols of a second within the width of the page. Formula vi measures $5\\frac{1}{2}$\", and with careful adjustment of the block it can only just be printed within the space of the page; not unfrequently, however, the whole or a portion of one of the terminal symbols is omitted.\n\nThere is no difficulty in determining what are the terminal symbols of each formula. The printing is not all carefully done, and when two or more impressions of the same formula go to make up the lines of the page, the terminal symbols of the adjoining impressions often overlap one another, while all the other symbols preserve an invariable fixed interval. It follows that those two symbols which overlap one another or vary in their interval, must be the terminal symbols. Moreover, in exceptional cases only one impression is placed within the width of the page, the remainder being blank; or the blank is filled up by a different formula. Thus, on p. 53, one full impression of formula iii and another full impression of formula x are placed side by side to make up the lines of the page, the two formulas between them measuring exactly $5\\frac{1}{2}$\". Again, pp. 92, 104, and 105, one full impression of formula viii is placed in the middle of the page, the rest of the page-lines being blank; on p. 84 the same occurs with regard to formula x. Such cases absolutely determine the terminal symbols of the respective formulas. When once the latter are recognized, it is seen that, as a rule, the impressions are placed so as to begin near the margin of the page. This, of course, one would naturally expect to be the case; but, by itself, it is not a sufficient guide for the determination of the terminal symbols, because the printing is not done very carefully, and not unfrequently the terminal symbol or several of them have\nmissed printing. Thus, e.g., on pp. 104 and 126, the lines of the page are made up of two fragments of formula iv.\n\nIt is far more difficult to determine what is right and left, top and bottom, of the formulas. One great difficulty lies in the manner of the printing. The same formula is not always placed in the same position on the same page. For example, on p. 101 the first formula occurs three times; once it is placed in the position shown in the Plate, but twice it is reversed. The third formula occurs three times on p. 82, twice in the position shown in the Plate and once reversed. On p. 4 the fourth formula occurs three times, twice in the position of the Plate, but once reversed. This variation is particularly frequent in the case of formula vi. Again, the formulas do not always maintain the same relative position towards one another on different pages. Thus, on pp. 29, 79, 82, 128 both the formulas i and iv hold the position shown in the Plate, but on pp. 41, 96, 104, 121, 131 formula i stands as in the Plate, while formula iv is reversed. On p. 65 the three formulas v, vi, and vii equally stand as shown in the Plate, but on p. 85 formula v is reversed, while formulas vi and vii are as in the Plate; and on p. 120 formula vii is reversed, while formulas v and vii stand as in the Plate. I might cite numerous other instances of a similar kind, but those given will sufficiently show the difficulty with which one has to contend.\n\nI have tried the following plan. It seems natural to assume that, in reading, the book was held as shown in the woodcut, i.e., so as to have always the opening towards the reader, and the stitched back away from him. The lines of print run parallel to the narrower side, as indicated by the letters \\(a b c, d e f, g h i\\). At the side of the opening they extend to the very edge of the page; in fact, occasionally the edge cuts through a line of print; while at the side, near the back of the book, there is always some blank space, occasionally as much as an inch in width. This circumstance seems to point to the top of the page.\nbeing at the inner side of the book, and to confirm the assumption that, in reading, the book is held as above explained. Holding the book, then, in this position, I examined all those pages in which the formulas i, ii, iii, and v are found, which formulas, as I have already stated, only occur exceptionally in the book. The number of these pages is forty-five. I examined also twenty-six other pages, taken at random. The total of pages thus examined is seventy-one, just one-half of the total of 142 printed ones. The result of my examination is shown in the subjoined Table II, where by 'upright' position is meant the position shown in the Plate.\n\n**TABLE II.**\n\n| Formula | Upright | Reverse | Both | Total pages | Upright | Reverse |\n|---------|---------|---------|------|-------------|---------|---------|\n| I       | 16      | 1       | 1    | 18          | 18      | 3       |\n| II      | 7       | 6       | \u2014    | 12          | 8       | 6       |\n| III     | 14      | 12      | 2    | 28          | 26      | 14      |\n| IV      | 22      | 19      | 9    | 50          | 55      | 45      |\n| V       | 5       | 6       | \u2014    | 11          | 7       | 7       |\n| VI      | 16      | 11      | 13   | 40          | 50      | 37      |\n| VII     | 16      | 9       | 6    | 31          | 28      | 18      |\n| VIII    | 53      | 5       | 5    | 63          | 208     | 37      |\n| IX      | 30      | 11      | 7    | 48          | 68      | 22      |\n| X       | 31      | 11      | 2    | 44          | 63      | 17      |\n\nThis table discloses some very striking differences, especially in the case of the first and eighth formulas. The proportions of $1 : 16$ (or $3 : 18$) and $5 : 53$ (or $37 : 208$) clearly suggest that the reversed impressions are simply\nmisprints. And considering further that the whole book is printed in a most slovenly manner, it does not seem improbable that all the reversed impressions are misprints, even in those cases where the proportion between the uprights and reverses is not so striking. This table would, therefore, seem to determine what is the top and the bottom of the formulas; and they are shown in my Plate in accordance with its indications.\n\nAs to the question of what is right and left, i.e., whether the formulas commence on the right-hand side and are to be read from the right to the left, there is only the following indication. As a rule the pages are printed up to their very edges, so much so that often the edge shows half a symbol. Only in very exceptional cases there is a slight margin left blank, measuring about one-quarter of an inch. Holding the book as before explained, this margin always appears on the right-hand side. It seems reasonable to assume that the margin marks the commencement of the printing; and it follows from this indication, combined with the previously explained one which determines its upright position, that the script of the formulas must be read from the right to the left. In accordance with this finding, the symbols composing the several formulas are numbered in my Plate.\n\nThe exact number of the symbols, however, which make up the first formula is not quite certain. I have numbered thirteen in the first and twelve in its second line; but many of the symbols consist of disjointed marks, which would, no doubt, form distinct connected symbols, if the impressions were more perfect. I have not been fortunate enough, however, to discover a single instance of a thoroughly well-printed impression. My numbering, therefore, should only be taken as a provisional one. In the case of all other formulas, I believe, my numbering is practically certain. Formula ii has eight symbols in the first and seven in the second line. The corresponding numbers on formula iii are thirteen and fourteen; in formula iv, thirteen and twelve; and in formula v, thirteen and fifteen. In the second line of formula iv, the two parts of what I have counted as the\nseventh symbol may possibly form two distinct symbols. Of formulas vi to x, which consist of one line each, the respective numbers are, 15, 11, 22, 8, and 11.\n\nOf the two scripts represented in the ten formulas, that seen in formulas i to vii seems to consist of ideograms or phonograms, verbal or syllabic, rather than alphabetic characters. Thus, No. 5 in the second line of formula ii and No. 2 in the second line of formula v look exactly like a leaf; and there are also other suggestive figures. A few symbols are clearly repeated: thus, No. 7 in the second line of formula ii and No. 5 in the first line of formula iii are the same; so are probably No. 2 in the second line of formula ii and No. 8 in the first line of formula iii. On the other hand, the symbols composing formulas viii to x appear to be truly alphabetic, though I do not know to what alphabetic system they may belong.\nPORTION OF THE THIRTEENTH EDICT FROM GIRNAR.\n\nBRAS\nAPRIL, 1900\nART. XV.\u2014A new fragment of the Thirteenth Edict of Piyadasi at Girnar. By \u00c9mile Senart, Hon. M.R.A.S.\n\nMy learned colleague and friend, Professor Rhys Davids, in the course of his recent travels in India, found at Junagadh two fragments that had broken away from the Girnar Rock. One was in the museum; the other was lying on the floor by the rock, and has now been removed to the museum. They belong to the Thirteenth Edict of Piyadasi. It will be remembered, in fact, that only a part of this tablet was found in situ. I am all the more obliged to him for the friendly confidence with which he asked me to present them to our colleagues of the Royal Asiatic Society, because, unless I am mistaken, the study of them will enable us to introduce important corrections into the reading or interpretation of several passages.\n\nTruth to tell, only one of these fragments appears to be of real importance; it is the one of which I have now in my hands an excellent photograph, a reprint of which accompanies the present notice. The second, very much broken and effaced, is smaller, and on a slab extending over only eight lines with about six characters on each. I only know its contents from a simple and partial sketch, but it contains characteristic indications sufficient to assign it without difficulty to its proper place in the body of the inscription.\n\nIt is the left side, the beginning of the edict, which has disappeared from the rock; it is therefore to these beginnings of lines that our fragments belong; the first to lines 1-11, the second (in the part of which I have a sketch) to lines 8-12. The latter I am inclined to put very close, if indeed\nit does not actually fit on with it at the end, to the right of the first. This will be clear at once from the transcription which I shall give presently.\n\nIn order to group together all useful indications, I think it will be well\u2014first, to enclose within brackets all that belongs to the small fragment; second, to reproduce, after transcribing the new parts, the first words (printed in italics) in which the actual text, as known and transcribed in the various reproductions of the edicts, goes on; and third, to indicate within parentheses, before and after each part of the new line, the approximate number of ak\u1e63aras which are still wanting and await further discoveries. I say 'approximate' for two reasons. One is general: we can only found such calculations on the collation of the parallel versions; now, although the essential identity of the various copies cannot be doubted, we must always reserve the possibility, nay the likelihood, of a few variations. The other reason has to do only with the twelfth, the last, line: the only legible character on the small fragment may have belonged to either of two contiguous words; I have taken it as belonging to the second, but the appearances which lead me to this conjecture are too slight to inspire me with any great confidence. However, in any case, this is too secondary a question to detain us longer.\n\n(1) . . . .

These first words call for no special remark, as\nthe new characters fill in, just as one would expect, a part\nof the lacuna. I would merely observe that here the va is\nperhaps, and even probably, followed by the anusv\u0101ra,\nrami = va. Compare my \"Inscriptions de Piyadasi,\" ii,\n331. It seems certain, by way of compensation, that the\nrequired anusv\u0101ra has been omitted at the end of vin\u012b-\nkhamaya.\n\nLine 5. The phrase in question here is couched in the\nfollowing terms at Kh\u0101lsi\u2014I accept the most recent\ntranscription of B\u00fchler (Epig. Ind., ii, 464): Nathi ca se\njanapade yat\u0101 nathi ime nik\u0101ya \u0101n\u0101nta yenesa b\u0101nhmane ca\nsamane ca nathi ca kuvedpi janapadasi yat\u0101 nathi manus\u0101nai\nekatalasi pi p\u0101s\u0101dasi no n\u0101ma pas\u0101de. The text of Mansera\n(ibid.) would correspond exactly, as far as it is preserved,\nwith that of Kh\u0101lsi, and the part which our fragment\ntakes in would be represented by nasti ime nikaya a . .\nyenesa. At Shahbaz Garhi the phrase is cut short by\nan inadvertency of the graver.1 I had translated: \"There\n\n1 I do not know why B\u00fchler (Epig. Ind., ii, 471, note) seemed so adverse\nto admitting a material error on the part of the graver. As the phrase stands\nat Shahbaz Garhi, it is halting, abrupt, and hardly explainable. I can only\nadhere to my first conviction (\"Inscriptions de Piyadasi,\" i, 297).\nis no country where there are not found congregations such as brahmans and \u015brama\u1e47as, and there is no (place) in any country where people do not profess the faith of some sect or other.\" B\u00fchler translates: \"And there is no country where there are not found these countless congregations into which these brahmans and ascetics (are divided); and there is nowhere a country where the people have faith in one creed alone.\" We took an\u0101mi\u1e6d\u1e6dha, he, as = ananta\u1e25, I, as = \u0101j\u00f1apt\u0101\u1e25: we were both wrong, and it is anatra, anatra, that is to say anyatra, which ought to be understood; this the fragment from Girnar states distinctly. It proves, moreover, that the ye which follows in the other versions, being here represented by ye, does not stand, as B\u00fchler thought, for the first syllable of the instrumental yena, but, as I had supposed, for the nominative ya\u1e25, here in its usual P\u0101li orthography, there under its M\u0101gadhi form. As to my idea of correcting nesa into esa, already condemned to all appearance by a comparison with Mansera, it is altogether set aside by our fragment.\n\nThis being premised, anyatra can only be taken as a preposition implying 'outside of,' 'independent of,' the word it governs\u2014according to rule in the ablative, and sometimes in the instrumental, in Buddhist language\u2014being included in the relative ya\u1e25. The simplest way would just be to understand nesa = no (nah) esa, and to translate \"such congregations, independently of the (congregations of) brahmans and \u015brama\u1e47as which exist among us.\" But I have great hesitation in admitting this very exceptional sandhi which would convert no esa into nesa, and especially in believing that the king would have employed the simple word 'us' to indicate his dominions in distinction from territories beyond. The only other alternative is to take nesa = na esa, and na as a negation; a redundant negation, certainly, and an involved, though not, I think, inadmissible, construction. It would recall in some measure such an inexactitude of language as the Greek oi \u1f04\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 \u1f10\u03be\u03c9\u03bd (compare Kr\u00fcger, Griech. Sprachl., 50, 4, 11), that is to say, \"the others who are foreigners,\" instead of \"others, foreigners,\" to\nexpress simply 'foreigners.' Such awkwardness of style would not be strange in the rather halting and inexpert prose of the edicts. The sense, at any rate, is not doubtful, and as I feel justified in maintaining my first interpretation against the secondary modifications which B\u00fchler proposed, I should translate: \"There is no country where such congregations are not found, even besides brahmans and sramanas, and there is no (place) in any country where men are not attached to some sect.\"\n\nLine 6. The adverb *aja* seems to have been wanting in this version: one cannot be certain that this was by accident; the sense is not affected by its omission to any appreciable extent.\n\nLine 7. The passage to which this fragment belongs has not yet been quite satisfactorily explained. Our text, by rejecting after *vucate tesai\u00f1* the genitive *dev\u0101nampiyasa*, necessarily upsets the explanation of B\u00fchler, who thought the stop ought to be supposed before *vucate*. On the other hand, if we break up into an independent proposition the words *vucate tesai\u00f1 dev\u0101nampiyasa* or *dev\u0101nampriyasa vucati tesai\u00f1*, what can one make of these two genitives side by side? I conclude that the words (I am taking the text of Shahbaz Garhi) from *anutape* to *tesai\u00f1* compose a single sentence, and, modifying one or two meanings in which I think B\u00fchler is undoubtedly wrong, I translate the whole passage thus: \"And the (savages of) the forests who are in the territories of Devanampriya, even these he treats kindly and tries to bring them back to good ways,\u00b9 and they are told that even the might of Devanampriya is based on repentance;\u00b2 let them therefore repent (of their crimes) and let them not be (instead of being) chastised.\" The context explains immediately afterwards how this conduct\n\n\u00b9 The signification of *ujjhatti, ujjhapi*, appears to me firmly established, not only by the comparison of Delhi iv, 17, 18; viii, 8 (compare my notes), but by the literary use, as in *Mah\u0101da-pa\u00f1ha*, Trenckner's edition, 210, 4; 8. These words could in fact be translated fairly exactly by 'conversion, to convert.'\n\n\u00b2 An allusion to the *annaya* of the commentator (*annaya, annap\u016bsa, annay\u0101ya*) traced to equate it to the regret which the outrages of which Kalinga had been the scene had caused the King, a regret which is put forward as the starting-point of the edict and the cause of his own conversion.\narises naturally from the desire which the King professes to proscribe all violence, even in the name of punishment.\n\nLine 9. To the reading hidalaja visavaji of Kh\u0101lsi, hidaraja visavajri, . . . raja visavajri admitted by B\u00fchler for Shahbaz Garhi and for Mansera, our fragment opposes a new reading which seems very different: idha r\u0101javisayamhi. It is perfectly straightforward and clear. I hasten to remark that the other readings can be brought into line with it without doing them violence, but that the contrary proceeding is impossible. From the first, I read visavasi at Kh\u0101lsi, and the very facsimile which B\u00fchler has published fully confirms me in this opinion; the width of the lower hook, which extends to the right beyond the middle hook (\u0930), entirely bars the reading ji. As to Shahbaz Garhi, to refer to our only positive document, the special drawing which B\u00fchler has tried to give of the corresponding letter (ZDMG., xliii, 168), one sees that it is, to say the least, quite as easy to interpret it as = si as = jri. I lay no stress on Mansera, for here we have no further authority than B\u00fchler's reading, and he owns himself that the group is not distinct. To sum up, it is si which the parallel versions, some certainly and others probably, have for the concluding syllable. As to the preceding one, it appears likely that Kh\u0101lsi has va; for the copies in Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b, the confusion between y and v is very easy, especially with such a flowing execution and on such friable stone; there is therefore at least great room for doubt. Even supposing a common reading visa(\u015ba)vasi to be certain, there are sufficient instances in the spelling of the edicts of the substituting of a v for the etymological y (I will only mention the desinence evu for eyu, normal or sporadic) to authorize us in interpreting with full confidence visavasi = visayasi, visayamhi, and in Sanscrit visaye. We get by this the advantage of doing away, in the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b versions, with the substitution, not perhaps inadmissible, but certainly less normal, of an \u015b for a different sibilant, \u1e63 (according to B\u00fchler). The pretended proper names Vi\u015ba and Vajri (V\u1e5bji) ought to be definitively struck out. The same holds\ngood of my Henas or H\u016bgas, and of B\u00fchler's Hidas; they must be relegated to the oblivion from which they should never have emerged. The idha of Girnar proves incontestably that in the same way hida is only the equivalent, quite well known indeed, of the Sanscrit iha.\n\nAt Girnar, the j of r\u0101ja is not accompanied by the mark of \u0101, and I have no doubt that we must likewise read laja at Kh\u0101lsi. Even were it otherwise, the \u0101 would be simply one error the more among so many other analogous ones: we are obviously face to face with the compound r\u0101j\u0101r\u0101jaye, that is, \"here, on the King's territory,\" the \"King\" being of course Piyadasi himself, who always speaks of himself thus in the third person.\n\nThe locative connects the locution with the expressions following yonakambojesu, which are in the same case. Thus it is evident that the two evameva which B\u00fchler's punctuation \u2014before hida\u2014left oddly side by side in one clause, ought to be separated; the first concludes the previous enumeration, the second commences a fresh one, presented in a different grammatical relation: \"and the same here in the King's territory, among the Yavanas and the Kambojas.\"\n\nLine 10. The anus\u1e6d\u0101ra grammatically necessary at the end of sa\u015bti\u1e41 appears to be visible on the stone; only the dot which expresses it has coalesced with the upper part of the ti by a fracture into which it has run. The ca is wanting in the other versions, but it is perfectly natural, dhamm\u0101nus\u0101s\u0101\u1e41 being co-ordinate with dhainnavutam cidh\u0101nain.\n\nThese observations will suffice, I hope, to show the deeply interesting nature of the new fragment, short as it is, and how greatly we are indebted to Professor Rhys Davids for having brought it to our knowledge.\n\n[Note.\u2014I take this opportunity of expressing the gratitude felt by European scholars to His Highness the Naw\u0101b and to\nfor 'land' could hardly be missed. Besides Akkad\u0101 could never signify the country of Akkad. If we consider that the lines belong to a bilingual religious text, they can only have the object of informing the reader that the upper lines are written in Akkadian, the lower in Sumerian, and we may then supply a verb, let us say \u0161atru, SAR at the end, and perhaps the word Lis\u0101nu before Akkad\u0101. And the consequence would be that the non-Semitic language of Babylonia was called Accadian, the Semitic language Sumerian, and that the grand old Hincks was right after all, at least as to the first name.\n\nI know that my hypothesis has no great chance to be at once accepted by the great majority of Assyriologists, but this is no reason for me to keep it to myself. Long before my attention was drawn to the above fragment I had come to the same conclusion on other grounds, which cannot be explained in this letter. I hope to be able to do so elsewhere. What I now only wish to state is, that Mr. Pinches, though I agree with him in the main, was wrong in thinking that our tablet refers, not to languages, but to countries.\u2014I am, dear Sir, yours truly,\n\nC. P. Tiele.\n\nTo the Secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nP.S.\u2014After the above was written, I remembered that Dr. Weissbach, in his \"Die Sumerische Frage\" (Leipzig, 1898, p. 174, n. 2), is also of opinion that the fragment K. 14,013 refers to languages, though he thinks the lacunae must be filled up in this way:\n\n[KITA EME TILLA-KI] ANTA EME-KU . . .\n[S\u016bpil\u0161] ak-ka-da-a c-lis su[mer] . . .\n\nand so comes to the conclusion that the non-Semitic language was called Sumerian, the Semitic Akkadian. But, then, why did not the scribe write akkad\u0101 just under EME TILLA KI, for which there was plenty of room? Let us hope that the discovery of a more complete text referring to the two languages may help us out of the dark.\n2.

Purification by Running Water.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014Purification by means of running water played\na great part in the ceremonies of the Essenes, in the cult of the\nDea Syra at Hierapolis, and in the religion of the Mandaites,\nwho have retained much of the faith of their Babylonian\nancestors. Manes appears to have laid stress upon it; and\nwe have biblical illustrations in the story of Naaman and\nin the practice of St. John the Baptist. Wishing to know\nhow far the idea was purely Syrian or had Babylonian\nanalogies, I consulted my friend Mr. W. St. Chad Boscawen,\nand he has sent me a note which appears to me worthy to find\na permanent place in the records of the Journal. I need\nhardly add that baptism in running water was only one of\nthe modes whereby men were purified from sin or defilement\nin ancient Babylonia. The peculiarity of the cults I have\nnoted above consists in the exclusive adoption of this method\nof purification, and in the fact that baptism must be in\na running stream.\u2014Yours truly,\n\nFeb. 27, 1900,\nTo the Secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society, London.\n\n\"Purification by Running Water.\"\n\nIn Chaldean mythology there was a goddess especially\nassociated with purification, to whom running or tidal water\nwas sacred. Her name was Nin-a-kha-kud-du, explained as\nBelit egubbil, \"Mistress of the waters of purification.\" In K. 157 we have a valuable passage: \u00e1na me teletle ana me ella ana me Nin akha kuddu, \"To the pure waters, to the holy waters, to the waters of Nin.A.\" In K. 111 she is especially associated with Ea, the lord of the Ocean (ab\u0161u), where we read, \"by the charm of Nin.A., by the incantation of Eridu, the incantation of the deep and the noble charm of Eridu, which fails not.\" In another fragment, K. 2573 and K. 9274, 15-17, we have her again alluded to as \"the pure lady, the traverser of the channels.\" She was also the goddess of the waves of the sea. In an incantation she is associated with the river-god, the god Naru; and we have the passage ina kibir Naru ell\u012bte, \"in the bed of the holy river (destroy them).\" The name Nin = lady + a = water + kha = holy + kud = channel + du = goes.\n\nIn a magical fragment we have the mie mute, \"waters of death,\" mentioned, and in the tenth Tab. of the Nimrod Epos, 70. 3, we read mie mute gatta la iltapit, \"waters of death which cleanse not the hands\"; there was also a well or spring of death referred to in R. iv, 26: mie buri sa qata la ilput, \"waters of the fountain or well which cleanse not the hands.\" In contradistinction to this there was the mie nagbi ellutim, \"the waters of the holy fountain,\" in which the tree of life grew, and the waters of which were poured out for Istar in the underworld, where we read, \"sprinkle Istar with the waters of life (mie napiste) and lead her from me (Allat).\"\n\nThe cleansing power of tidal or running water is shown by Gilgames being told to bathe seven times in the sea, \"and may the sea carry away his leprosy\": see my article on Leprosy in the Babylonian Record. The fountain of life was called Sukhal-ziku, \"the grotto of Life.\" Those sacred bathing-places were common, and are represented on the Ballawat gates; these were situated at the head waters of the Tigris, the river Zubnat, now the Tebeneh Su.\"\nIn the Deluge tablet we read, \"take him to the place of purification\"; and in the tablet of the Sun-god from Sippara we read, \"he purified himself, and washed his mouth with the purification of Ea on the banks of the Euphrates.\"\n\nEgyptian Notes.\n\nThe passage referring to the baptismal purification of Hatspsu at Deir el Bahari and that of Amenophis III at Luxor is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Sek hem ren. s. pu ma\u0101 ar en neter em bah.} \\]\n\n\"For of old her name was that which truly (was) made of god in the former time.\"\n\nThen a god is represented pouring water over her head from a vase shaped in form of \\( \\text{\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)} \\), and saying:\n\n\\[ \\text{t'et sebu-na-ten em mu apen nu ankh nas neb tet neb.} \\]\n\n\"He says to her, 'I make thee ceremonially pure with this water, which is all life, power, and all stability.'\"\n\n\\[ \\text{seneb neb, \"and all health\"; dat arit, \"of divine foods.\" The word seban occurs in many texts as making ceremonially pure.} \\]\n\nI have not been able to copy the inscription of Amenophis III, but it is much the same.\n4. THE EARLIEST OCCURRENCE OF DEVAN\u0100GAR\u012a IN PRINTED BOOKS.\n\nSir,\u2014In my article on the Origin and Early History of Chess, printed in the January number of the Journal for 1898, I note on p. 136 that in Hyde's *Historia shahiludii*, published in 1694, seventeen Sanskrit words are engraved in Devan\u0101gar\u012b, adding that this is probably the earliest instance of the use of that character to be found in any printed book. Soon after the appearance of my article I received a postcard from Professor Th. Zachariae, of Halle, referring me to a Dutch botanical work published at Amsterdam in the last quarter of the seventeenth century. Having looked up the book in the Bodleian Library, I wrote a note about it for the April number of the Journal for 1898. But I mislaid the slip, and only found it again a few days ago. The work in question consists of twelve large folio volumes describing in Latin the plants and trees of Southern India, and illustrated with numerous plates, which, considering the time at which they were produced, are remarkably fine. The title is *Hortus Indicus Malabaricus adornatus per Howricum van Rheede tot Drakenstein*. The first volume is dated Amsterdam, 1678, and the last 1703. The introduction to the former contains a plate in which eleven lines of Sanskrit are engraved in Devan\u0101gar\u012b characters. In this the three pandits who assisted the author in his work give their names (Raiga-bha\u1e6d\u1e6da, Vin\u0101yaka-pa\u1e47\u1e0dita, \u0100pu-bha\u1e6d\u1e6da), and mention the date as *Satir\u0101hama-s\u0101ka* 1597. The author seems to have understood the meaning of the era, though he transliterates the name incorrectly; for he explains the date with the words *qui apud nos est* 1674 (for 1675). The name of the author appears in some of the volumes as Rheede van Draakenstein. In the first volume of his work we have the occurrence of Devan\u0101gar\u012b sixteen years earlier than in Hyde's book. It is not likely that any earlier instance will be found.\n\nMarch, 1900.\n\nA. A. Macdonell.\nNOTICES OF BOOKS.\n\nTHREE RECENT RUSSIAN CONTRIBUTIONS TO PERSIAN SCHOLARSHIP. By Professor V. Zhukovski and Captain A. G. Toumanski.\n\nThe continually increasing importance of the contributions made to Oriental, especially Persian and Turkish, studies by Russian scholars, and the fact that these are now generally written in the Russian language, render a knowledge of that tongue more and more indispensable for serious students. Lacking this accomplishment myself, I have been fortunate enough to find in my friend and colleague Mr. Ellis H. Minns a willing and competent coadjutor, by whose help I have been able to acquaint myself with the gist of the introductory remarks prefixed to the three important publications of which I propose to give here a brief account. Two of these are connected with Sufism, and consist of two separate biographies of the early and celebrated Persian mystic Shaykh Ab\u00fa Sa'id ibn Abi'l-Khayr; while the third deals with the B\u00e1b\u00ed doctrine, and comprises the text and translation of the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas, or \"Most Holy Book,\" in which Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h summed up his teachings, together with sundry other B\u00e1b\u00ed documents, and a learned Introduction. The former are contributed by Professor Zhukovski, the latter is the work of Captain Toumanski, whose fruitful investigations into B\u00e1b\u00ed history and theology are already well known to all those who interest themselves in these subjects.\nI. Professor Zhukovski's Texts.\n\nThese two volumes, both treating of the life, deeds, and sayings of Shaykh Ab\u00fa Sa'id b. Abi'l-Khayr (d. A.D. 1048-9), differ materially in size. The smaller text, based on the unique British Museum MS. (Or. 249; see Rieu's Persian Catalogue, p. 342), comprises only 6+ pages, and is entitled H\u00e1d\u00edt u sukhan\u00e1n-i-Shaykh Ab\u00fa Sa'id Fa\u1e0dlu'll\u00e1h b. Abi'l-Khayr al-Mihant; the larger, based on the St. Petersburg and Copenhagen MSS., contains 14 + 91 pages, and is entitled Asr\u00e1ru't-taw\u1e25id fi mag\u00e1mat\u00ed'sh-Shaykh Abi Sa'id. For the sake of brevity we shall speak of these by the abbreviated titles of H\u00e1d\u00edt and Asr\u00e1r.\n\nThe relation of these two books is carefully examined by Professor Zhukovski, who comes to the conclusion that the former was one of the sources of the latter, and that both were written by great-great-grandsons of the Saint who is the subject of these memoirs, the author of the H\u00e1d\u00edt being probably a son of Ab\u00fa Raw\u1e25 Lutfu'll\u00e1h, while the author of the second is known to be Mu\u1e25ammad b. al-Munawwar. Their relation to one another and to the Saint is shown by the following genealogical tree:\n\n```\nAb\u00fa Sa'id Fa\u1e0dlu'll\u00e1h b. Abi'l-Khayr\n    |\n    Ab\u00fa T\u00e1hir Sa'id b. Fa\u1e0dlu'll\u00e1h\n    |\n    Ab\u00fa Sa'id As'ad b. Sa'id\n    |\n    Munawwar b. Abi Sa'id\n    |\n    Mu\u1e25ammad (author of Asr\u00e1r)\n```\n\nThe Asr\u00e1r is dedicated to the Gh\u016brid king Ghiy\u00e1thu'd-D\u00edn Mu\u1e25ammad b. S\u00e1m (d. A.H. 599), and, since the death of Sanjar (A.H. 552) is mentioned in it, must have been composed between these limits, that is, between A.D. 1157 and 1202, while the H\u00e1d\u00edt must be placed a little earlier. Both texts are of primary importance for the early history of \u1e62ufism, since, as the editor shows, they are amongst the sources of Far\u012bdu'd-D\u00edn 'Att\u0101r's Tadhkiratu'l-Awliy\u00e1,\nas well as of the *Nafah\u00e1tul-'Uns*, J\u00e1mi's later and better-known Biographies of Saints. Promising that, alike in point of typography and critical accuracy, the texts leave nothing to be desired, we must, in this necessarily brief notice, confine ourselves to a short statement of the chief points touched on in the introductions prefixed to each.\n\nThe unique MS. on which the *H\u00e1d\u00edt* is based (dated A.H. 699 = A.D. 1299) must be familiar to most of those students of Persian palaeography who frequent the British Museum. Unfortunately, owing to its almost complete lack of diacritical points, as well as to its damaged and worm-eaten condition, the MS. is singularly illegible. Professor Zhukovski, in working on the photograph of the original which he caused to be made for him, was, however, able to correct and restore the text by means of the *Asr\u00e1r*, in which a great portion of its substance, as well as what appears to be its proper title, are included, so that eventually an almost complete restoration of the work was successfully effected. The editor has very wisely preserved the orthographical and grammatical peculiarities of the text, the chief of which are noticed on pp. 5-6. They closely correspond with those to which I called attention in my article in this Journal (July, 1894, pp. 417-524) on *An Old Persian Commentary*, and, indeed, with all Persian texts dating from an epoch anterior to the Mongol invasion (middle of the thirteenth century of our era) which have not been modernized by later scribes.\n\nIn the Introduction to the *Asr\u00e1r*, Professor Zhukovski insists on its importance, first, as an early prose monument of the Persian language; secondly, as one of the oldest monographs on Sufi saints; thirdly, as presenting a singularly clear and graphic picture of dervish life at that period; and lastly, as one of the primary sources of those general biographies of the holy men of Isl\u00e1m which alone have hitherto been generally accessible. He further points out the careful and critical methods of the author, the rigorous *isn\u00e1d* by which he vouches for his statements, and his almost exclusive use of contemporary authorities, known\nto him either by oral tradition or by memoranda contained in notebooks. The only book properly so called which he used seems to have been the above-mentioned H\u00e1d\u00edt. Of the two MSS. of the \u00c1s\u00e1d used by the editor, the Copenhagen Codex is also of a respectable antiquity, being dated A.H. 711 (= A.D. 1311), so that here also we have many interesting archaisms, of which the most remarkable are discussed at pp. 7\u20138.\n\nThe importance of these two texts (or rather three, since another, entitled Ris\u00e1da-i-Hawrd\u2019iyya, is appended to the \u00c1s\u00e1d) is very great alike from the literary, the historical, and the philological points of view, and we only regret that space does not permit us to accord them a notice proportionate to their merits. All students of Persian literature will unite in a cordial expression of gratitude to Professor Zhukovski for having rendered available to them two books of such capital importance.\n\nII. Captain Toumanski\u2019s edition of the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas.\n\nBoth of the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas, the most important of the scriptures received as divine revelations by the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed B\u00e1b\u00eds, and of the diligent and eminently successful investigations of Captain Toumanski of the Russian Artillery, who has recently supplemented the information collected during his long sojourn at Askabad (\u2018Ishq-\u00e1b\u00e1d), that centre of B\u00e1b\u00ed activity, by a visit to Persia undertaken with the special object of investigating this matter, I have repeatedly had occasion to speak in my books and articles on the B\u00e1b\u00eds. Captain Toumanski\u2019s original researches and discoveries were almost contemporaneous and coextensive with my own, although in the publication of results he, impeded by other and more urgent duties, was to some extent forestalled by myself, to whom greater leisure and immunity from interruption was, through no merit on my part, vouchsafed. The extremely generous manner in which he speaks of my work in this field affects me, therefore, the more deeply,\nand impels me, before speaking of his excellent and scholarly work, to offer this tribute of personal gratitude for an appreciation which, coming as it does from one of the greatest authorities on this subject, has, I confess, caused me the very keenest pleasure.\n\nThe text of the *Aqdas* published by Captain Toumanski is based chiefly on the selection of Bah\u00e1'\u00ed scriptures lithographed at Bombay in 1892, which is to be regarded as canonical and official, and of which the contents are fully described at pp. xxviii\u2013xxxvi of his Introduction; but it has been carefully collated throughout with the MS. noticed by Baron Rosen in vol. vi of the *Collections Scientifiques* (p. 243), which was obtained by Captain Toumanski during his sojourn at Askabad in 1890. I hope, when I have had time to collate his text with my own MSS., and another which the generosity of the Leyden Library has temporarily placed at my disposal, and to work through the translation and notes (which, based on the high authority of several eminent B\u00e1bis, notably the learned M\u00edrz\u00e1 Abu'l-Fadl Gulpayag\u00e1n\u00ed, will doubtless throw a new and abundant light on many points hitherto obscure), to discuss in greater detail this portion of the book, as well as the subsidiary documents for the illustration of the *Aqdas* which it contains, but for the present I must confine my necessarily brief remarks to the clear and excellent Introduction (pp. iii\u2013xlviii) by which the volume is prefaced.\n\nA considerable portion of this Introduction is historical, and traces the developments of the B\u00e1bi movement and doctrine from the obscure period which immediately succeeded the B\u00e1b's death (A.D. 1850) to the schism between the Ezel\u00eds and Bah\u00e1'\u00eds, and thence onwards to the death of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h on May 28, 1892. This sketch is no mere recapitulation of facts already known, but contains much new and important material drawn both from B\u00e1bi documents not previously accessible, and from official reports of Russian consulates. Amongst the latter attention is specially called to that on pp. xvii\u2013xviii, dated from the Russian Consulate at Tabriz, December 11, 1866 (old\nstyle), which affords remarkable confirmation of the statements contained in the Ezel\u00ed Hasht Bihisht as to the assassination at Tabr\u00edz of Aq\u00e1 Sayyid \u2018Al\u00ed \u2018Arab the Ezel\u00ed by Shaykh Ahmad the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed. The examination of the assassin, who made no concealment of his deed or its motives, before M\u00edrz\u00e1 Qahram\u00e1n the Mushir-i-Lashkar and the Mujtahid H\u00e1j\u00ed M\u00edrz\u00e1 B\u00e1qir, is described, and in addition to this we are given the text and translation of a most remarkable and characteristic letter of instruction found on the prisoner, a document so curious that it would well deserve to be reproduced here, did space permit.\n\nThe periods during which the B\u00e1b\u00ed exiles resided at Baghdad (A.D. 1852\u20131862 or 1863), Constantinople (summer or autumn of 1863), and Adrianople are treated with great fulness and skill, and many hitherto obscure points (notably the causes which led to their expulsion from the first and last of these places, and their final banishment to Acre and Cyprus) are made clear. Attention is also called to several important epistles and other documents, which, though known to exist, have not yet been seen or obtained by any European investigator. Of these, the earliest of Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds epistles or manifestos, written in the garden of Naj\u00edb P\u00e1sh\u00e1 near Baghdad, on the eve of the B\u00e1bis\u2019 departure for Constantinople, and entitled Sham\u00fal-Kalim\u00e1t (p. xv), is one of the most notable. Of the subsequent documents emanating from Bah\u00e1, the order of the more important, and as far as possible their dates, are carefully determined.\n\nAs Captain Toumanski is dealing exclusively with Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed literature, he naturally says but little of \u0160uhb-i-Ezel, whom, however, it is satisfactory to note, he regards (p. vii) as \u201cin all probability the legitimate successor of the B\u00e1b,\u201d who \u201cremained the faithful preserver of the primitive doctrine.\u201d At the same time he recognizes the superior influence and force of character of Bah\u00e1, whose development of the ethical side of the hitherto confused, dreamy, and unpractical doctrines of the B\u00e1b he appraises in a brief but well-worded paragraph (p. xlviii).\nOf the rare and precious record of the early B\u00e1b\u00ed movement (down to 1852, when the author was put to death at T\u00edhr\u00e1n in the great persecution consequent on the attempted assassination of the late N\u00e1siru'd-D\u00edn Sh\u00e1h) by H\u00e1ji M\u00edrz\u00e1 J\u00e1n\u00ed of K\u00e1sh\u00e1n, hitherto known to us only by the two Gobineau MSS. (of which one is incomplete), now in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale at Paris, Captain Toumanski was fortunate enough to secure a new MS., written in July, 1874 (p. v, n. I ad calc.), with the help of which it may perhaps be possible to establish a satisfactory text of this most important history. He hazards a conjecture, however, that this book was at a comparatively early date (before the compilation of the T\u00e1rikh-i-Jad\u00edd) subjected to purposeful manipulations by one or both factions of the B\u00e1b\u00eds. The passage cited by Captain Toumanski on pp. viii-ix is, at any rate, wanting in the Paris MS., and is rendered very suspicious by the occurrence of the formula after the name of Bah\u00e1, who, in the Paris Codex, is generally spoken of simply as \"the brother of His Holiness Ezel\" (\u0627\u064e\u062e\u0648\u06cc \u062d\u0636\u0631\u062a \u0627\u0632\u0644), or \"His Excellency the Brother\" (\u0627\u064e\u062e\u0648\u06cc \u062c\u0646\u0627\u0628). Captain Toumanski's MS. is defective, but fortunately only in the earlier part, of which we already have a second text in the Paris MS. No. 1070, so that we shall no longer be dependent for any part of the text on a single MS.\n\nIn concluding this brief notice, we offer Captain Toumanski our sincere thanks and congratulations for the notable service which he has rendered to all students of Eastern religions by the publication of this excellent book.\n\nE. G. B.\n\nThe complete MS. is numbered 1071 and the incomplete one 1070 of the Supplement Persian. The latter contains only the first third of the book, and was written in A.H. 1279 (= A.D. 1862).\nASIATIC STUDIES. By Sir Alfred C. Lyall. (London: John Murray, 1899.)\n\nThis is a republication of essays written during the last twenty-five years. They treat mainly of religion and politics in the Far East, with the writer's usual knowledge and charm. This notice only has to do with the religious questions raised in reviewing the works of Max M\u00fcller, Frazer, Jevons, and Mias Kingaley. It is unsatisfactory to find it doubted whether the history of religious development can be reconstructed by the study of existing beliefs. This opinion, however, is modified by an admission in other passages that the morphology of religious beliefs can be arrived at by the comparative method, which is in fact occasionally used in these volumes. In the author's words the highest mystery may lie latent in the lowest fetishism, and cannibalism have a remote connection with religious dogma. Mr. Tylor and Mr. Spencer certainly would not endorse the suggestion that their works contained almost everything that can be safely and soberly written on primitive culture. These very studies show the progress since made.\n\nThe worship of the dead, or, as Mr. Tylor calls it: manes worship, is one of the subjects which need the least supplementing since Primitive Culture was published. The very important part this cult may have played in early spirit worship is well explained in one essay, giving recent examples of the evolution of deities from the spirits of dead men in India and China. Mr. Tylor fully describes the similar European custom, which confers official promotion after death by rites of beatification and canonization. An unedifying instance took place near Naples not long since in a sort of popular cult of a noted dead brigand. A tree was shown to the writer in Ceylon as the home of an ancestor's spirit. Here is rudimentary matter which may very well have been part of primitive religion, of ghost and other spirit worship, transmigration and totemism.\nThe objection to Mr. Jevons' explanation of Totemism, as a degenerate revelation, are well stated. Mr. Frazer's remarkable study of Totemism meets on the whole with approval. Notwithstanding some reservations the author seems to admit virtually the view taken in the *Golden Bough* that nature worship, especially in the form of worship of the spirit of vegetation, was one of the chief factors in the evolution of religion and custom. An objection is made that the important share of human deification is not brought out in that book. The reason may be that Mr. Frazer did not think it within the scope of his work to consider all the varieties of animism. Probably it was the earlier cult, and the two may have interacted to a great extent as the author believes; Hinduism exhibits them both contained in the same religion.\n\nThe Euhemeristic doctrine is to some extent skilfully rehabilitated by the author, but it biases his judgment. Without proof he suspects Osiris, Isis, Atys, Adonis, and the Arcian priest to represent real persons, and is inclined to consider evident allegories as only \"parasitical superstitions.\" In the cases of fused cults mentioned by the author, the deified man, on the contrary, is the parasite. He supports his argument by depreciation of the stores of first-hand trustworthy material collected of late years. It is inaccurate to describe them as largely made up from old books and modern hearsay, jokes, and tales, invented to satisfy curious travellers, nonsensical fables, and idiotic barbarous notions. The comparative method enables the student to easily detect misstatement or imposture, and he is unlikely to find many barbarous notions unworthy of his attention.\n\nThe meteorological theory of mythology advocated by Mr. Max M\u00fcller meets with little favour from the author. The ethnological school are unjustly accused of only substituting another form of nature worship. Its doctrine is decidedly eclectic.\n\nThe author suggests that a belief in Transmigration may have been borrowed by savagery from Buddhism. Probably\nhe had Hinduism as well in his mind, for the belief existed in India before Buddhism arose. Mr. Tylor, among other writers, shows it to be a common savage dogma; it is a marked feature of Totemism. Therefore, in the absence of good contrary evidence it is to be taken as an instance of a \"similar species . . . springing up spontaneously out of congenial soil . . . independently of transmission,\" to use the author's words in another connection.\n\nThe author shares Mr. Frazer's opinion that the origin of Taboos is to be found in \"maxims of common prudence,\" an explanation adequate to the facts. Mr. Jevons' mystic view of it as a sort of categorical imperative is therefore rightly rejected.\n\nWitchcraft is treated in two essays. Magic, defined as primitive science, is held to be its special characteristic, and a later development than spirit worship, just as science follows observation of facts, and as ritual is a product of the belief in the existence of spiritual beings. In the earlier essay he considers religion and witchcraft to have always been in a state of incessant war; but in the latter one he seems inclined to accept Miss Kingsley's conclusion that in West Africa they were originally indistinguishable. When religion had differentiated itself witchcraft was the residuum. Mr. Jevons calls it at one time a survival; at another time he speaks of it as a degeneration, rather inconsistently, but in keeping with his underlying theory of a primitive revelation. He recognizes more fully than Sir Alfred Lyall how much they have acted and reacted on one another; magic being sometimes sanctioned by religion, or even taken into its organization. According to Mr. Rhys Davids, Lamaism is a contemporary illustration of this mixture. The conclusion is that the only practical ground for distinction is the common and doubtful one of orthodoxy and morality, as indeed the author seems finally to admit.\n\nA reasoned opinion on the vexed question of a primitive belief in a supreme moral being would have been interesting. The subject is brought to mind by the author's remark that\nneither the peoples of India nor those of West Africa consider the Creator, or First Cause, to be a useful object of worship, because since he created the world he has taken no farther trouble about it. He simply exists. The Indian belief, however, hardly represents the Vedic thought. It may well be even older.\n\nJ. B. Andrews.\n\nThe Bride's Mirror, or Mir-\u0100tu-l :Ar\u016bs of Maulavi Nazir-Ahmad. Edited (in Roman type) by G. E. Ward, M.A. (London: H. Frowde, 1899.)\n\nThe Bride's Mirror is a girl's book with a moral. It narrates the follies, the silliness, and hasty temper of a young wife\u2014A\u1e63ghari; the incidents are familiar, and the reflections commonplace; but the language is simple and free from affectation, perhaps because it is the work of a father writing for his children. It therefore forms a good textbook for learning Hindustani, while it supplies an introduction to the everyday life of a Mahomedan household: reasons which have led Mr. Ward to adapt it to the use of English ladies working in zenanas, and to expend upon a mediocre work the labour usually devoted to a classic. The text is printed in Roman characters; a free translation is given of the Preface\u2014always the most difficult and ambitious part of a Hindustani composition; grammatical notes and an elaborate vocabulary complete the work. The book differs from most Hindustani manuals, not only by the nice accuracy of its scholarship, but by the glimpse it affords of Mr. Ward's studies in the science of language. Note, for instance, his explanation on p. 224 of the difference between Oriental and Western methods of thought\u2014how the one unconsciously specializes from the general, the other generalizes from the individual; or, again, how it happens that the imperative mood precedes the indicative, and the vocative comes before the nominative. For such stray crumbs we are duly thankful; and, indeed, the pains which\nMr. Ward has bestowed upon the transliteration, vocabulary, and notes, deserve nothing but praise.\n\nThe arrangement of the vocabulary is the only point that raises a doubt. Although the text is in the Roman character, the vocabulary follows the order of the Persian alphabet. The question is a difficult one, and it really serves to show the insurmountable perplexities inherent in every system of transliteration. Mr. Ward must have bestowed much thought upon the matter, and doubtless adopted the present arrangement upon sufficient grounds; but the value of a vocabulary depends largely upon the readings with which it can be used; and we may safely predict that only seriously minded students will grapple with the eight-and-forty signs or combinations of letters which must be mastered before the vocabulary can be consulted. The labour devoted to the key might be much more profitably devoted to the original script. In any case the key to the transliteration ought to have been printed as a preface to the vocabulary, and not as an appendix to the introduction. Mr. Ward complains that few Englishwomen in India take any pains to acquire the vernacular. An Englishwoman's Hindustani is usually limited to the imperative mood; and Mr. Ward's transliterations will scarcely smooth her onward path, if she falls into a lexicographical bog at the end of the volume.\n\nThe most original and the most interesting part of the work is the introduction. It is there that Mr. Ward discusses his particular theories and airs his pet heresies. Hindustani, says Mr. Ward, the vernacular of Hindustan, is a single language, one and indivisible; but Pundits and Maulavis, writing under Government patronage and stimulus, have employed two scripts, and thus made believe to create two vernaculars. Well, there is a certain modicum of truth in Mr. Ward's account of the genesis of Hindustani literature, but few persons will admit that there is only one vernacular in the upper valley of the Ganges, and still fewer will agree in the conclusions drawn by Mr. Ward. The vernacular of the peasantry throughout the greater\npart of the country is Hindi\u2014a language of many dialects and grammatical forms, and with a well-known literature that has existed for centuries. Urdu, the lingua franca created by camp-followers and Mahomedan converts, is comparatively recent, and so far from fixed that a resident of Delhi will find himself a stranger among the Mahomedans of Madras or Bombay. The anarchy of the eighteenth century did not favour literary efforts, and the language has acquired a literary and therefore a fixed form for the first time in the nineteenth century. Masters of style, like Sir Syad Ahmad, have shown that it can be written with clearness, simplicity, and grace. At the same time the language of a Mahomedan noble of Delhi or Aligarh differs from the language of a Gorakhpur or Behar peasant a good deal more than the language of an Oxford don does from that of a yokel of Somerset. There are two vernaculars, not one.\n\nMr. Ward's plea for transliteration in the Roman character is based partly upon the battle of the Persian and the Nagari scripts and partly upon motives of convenience. The system of transliteration which he has adopted is the one usually received, but with two modifications. The hamza he makes with a dash \u2014, the ain with a dash and a dot \u2014. His objections to the ordinary system are good, and the alterations seem open to no reproach except that of novelty. But Mr. Ward's essay on transliteration is by no means confined to such minor details; he plunges deeply into the first principles of phonetics and the history of articulate speech. We have heard of a gentleman who had a craze about the initial yod; like King Charles's head, it turned up in everything. Mr. Ward carries on a crusade against all the vowels, but especially against that sorry maid of all work, the vowel a. A vowel, we were taught in our youth, could be pronounced by itself, but Mr. Ward explains at length that this is wrong. To pronounce a vowel by itself is an impossibility; it is always preceded by a mute consonant. In England, according to Mr. Ward, consonants are merely regarded as supporters of the vowels;\nin India the vowels represent \"the motion\" of the consonants. And the general history of vowels shows that while they originally followed consonants, they came in time to precede them. Into these high regions of linguistic speculation we dare not enter, although we might remark that inasmuch as certain articulate sounds (commonly called vowels) have a distinct musical or harmonic value, and others (commonly called consonants) have not, it is well to distinguish the two by separate appellations. It may be that the one cannot do without the support of the other; but Mr. Ward's speculations on the subject appear to be based in the main upon his Semitic studies. The question assumes a practical shape in the matter of spelling. The Semitic languages, since they usually employ biliteral roots with fixed vowels, have a consonantal script. Aryan languages abound in triliteral roots with altering vowels, and are written syllabically. For Hindi, an Aryan tongue, we have an almost perfect medium in the Nagari alphabet, spelled syllabically. Persian and Urdu are also Aryan, although overlaid with Arabic; and they are furnished with a Semitic, i.e. consonantal, script, which happens to be convenient, but theoretically fits them very ill. The question is how to represent the Nagari and Urdu scripts in the English language\u2014a language which is spelled with little regard to sound. Now we may aim at one of two things in any system of transliteration. We may adopt a system of conventions by which we can at any moment replace the original script. The most recent German method of transliterating hieroglyphics is an instance in point. It is a mere algebraical notation. Judged by this standard, Mr. Ward's transliteration is defective, since he omits the final h in Persian words after a short vowel. Or we may attempt to reproduce the sounds of one language in terms of another. Every such attempt must be merely approximate at the best; for every language calls into play a different set of muscles\u2014a different accent, different modes of drawing the breath. To teach a living language a living master is required. Mr. Ward's transliteration\nwill smooth the path of the beginner, but it will neither supersede the necessity of a teacher nor the labour of acquiring an Oriental script. We would advise every student of the book to work with the original as well as with the transliteration. If he masters the book, he will have a fair knowledge of the language; if he can read the script, he will possess a key to the literature.\n\nJ. K.\n\nMaspero's \"Struggle of the Nations\": Egypt, Syria, and Assyria. 1896.\n\nIn the Volume of the Journal of our Society for 1895 I reviewed the First Volume of M. Maspero's noble and epoch-making Book; it was entitled the \"Dawn of Civilization.\" The Second Volume, known by the name given above, appeared, at least in its English dress, in 1896; the Third Volume, known by the name of \"The Passing of the Empires,\" appeared last year, and carries the reader over a period of five hundred years from 830 B.C. to 330 B.C. These dates are fairly certain, but no attempt at Chronology is given in the two earlier volumes. The sequence of events is carefully built up on the testimony of Inscriptions on Metal and Clay, and is based upon Dynasties. Not a line of trustworthy contemporary Historical Narrative is forthcoming. We have a sample of the state of affairs in the Hebrew Books, in which Chronology as we understand it, did not exist.\n\nThese three lordly volumes of 800 pages each, large quarto, amply illustrated by Photographs inserted in the page, were composed and published in the French Language by a French Scholar, and Excavator, of all his contemporaries by his talents, opportunities, and industry, the most competent. But all three volumes have had the privilege and honour of being translated into English by an accomplished lady, who has laboriously edited them, each page being submitted to M. Maspero; and this Volume in its English dress has had the further advantage of being edited by an English\nScholar, of all the most qualified for the task, Professor Sayce. I write with familiarity with the subject, as I had the honour on my first visit to Egypt in 1843 of being in the company of Professor Lepsius, and have had the pleasure of the acquaintance of M. Maspero and Professor Sayce for a quarter of a Century, and have read nearly all their publications.\n\nIt is no light matter to work your way through these colossal volumes: I have accomplished the task in two, and in my eightieth year propose to grapple with the third at the close of the current year. The three branches of the great subject, Mesopotamia, Syria, and Egypt, are very familiar to me in the separate works published by other authors; but this combined treatment of the whole Region betwixt the Tigris and Nile has a strange fascination, and brings the entire subject before the reader as if History were reflected in the slides of a lantern. Each narrator of the Chronicles of a separate Region is tempted by his reasonable devotion to his own subject to exaggerate the merits and fortunes of his particular Heroes; but in these quasi-cosmopolitan pages we find impartial notices of all, who resembled each other in nothing else, except in their ceaseless love of Conflict, Ambition, Cruelty, and Lust for Plunder.\n\nThe Second Volume, \"The Struggle of the Nations,\" which I now pass under review, is divided into Seven Chapters: the subject of each is worth recording.\n\nI. The first Chaldean Empire and the Hyksos in Egypt. The part played by Syria in the Ancient World. Babylon and the first Chaldean Empire. The dominion of the Shepherd Kings or Hyksos in Egypt.\n\nII. Syria at the beginning of the Egyptian Conquest. Nineveh. The towns, civilization, and religion, of Syria. Phenicia.\n\nIII. The Eighteenth Theban Dynasty. Thutmosis I. Hatshepsitu and Thutmosis III. Amenothes III. Worship of the fiery Disk or Atonu.\nIV. The reaction against Egypt. The Nineteenth Dynasty. The Empire of the Khita or Hittite, in Syria and Asia Minor. Seti I and Ramses II, the great Sesostris. Minepthah and the Israelite Exodus.\n\nV. The close of the Theban Empire. Ramses III. The Theban city after the Ramessides. Manners and Customs, and Population. The predominance of Amon and his High Priest.\n\nVI. The rise of the Assyrian Empire. Phenicia and the Northern Nations after the death of Ramses III. The first Assyrian Empire. Tiglath Pileser I. The Arameans and the Khita.\n\nVII. The Hebrews and the Philistines. Damascus. The Israelites in the Land of Canaan. The Judges. The Philistines and the Hebrew Kingdom Saul, David, Solomon. The defection of the Tribes. The Twenty-first Egyptian Dynasty.\n\nThe discoveries of the last half-century have had one result in stripping the Hebrew tribes of the false glamour of importance, with which Medi\u00e6val Europe had clothed them: one only allusion to their existence has been found in the Inscriptions of Egypt. With regard to the much vaunted Temple of Jerusalem, Maspero remarks (p. 747): \"The limited knowledge of the Hebrews doubtless led them to consider their temple as unique in the world: as a fact it presented nothing remarkable either in proportion, arrangement, or in the variety and richness of its ornamentation and furniture. Compared with the magnificent monuments of Egypt and Chaldea, the work of Solomon was what the Hebrew Kingdom appears to us among the Empires of the ancient world\u2014a little temple suited to a little people.\" Whatever it was, it was not the work of indigenous Hebrew builders, but the idolaters of Phenicia were employed in the construction.\n\nIt is strange that oblivion and darkness should have closed over both Mesopotamia and the Valley of the Nile.\nduring the period of Greek and Roman influence. Such a book as the one which I now notice, could not have been written fifty years ago, when I first visited Egypt. The fate of Babylon and Nineveh was harder even than that of Thebes and Memphis, yet no Nations of Antiquity had taken such pains, by a wealth of Inscriptions in the Hieroglyphic Ideographs and Cuneiform Syllabaries, to perpetuate their history. We have to thank Professor Maspero for this interesting and instructive Volume.\n\nMarch, 1900.\n\nR. N. Cust.\n\nMITTHEILUNGEN DES SEMINARS F\u00dcR ORIENTALISCHE SPRACHEN an der K\u00f6nigl. Friedriche Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin. Herausgegeben von Professor Dr. E. Sachau. Jahrgang ii, pt. 2. Westasiatische Studien; redigirt von Professor Dr. A. Fischer und Dr. K. Foy. (Berlin and Stuttgart, 1899.)\n\nThe volume contains a series of essays, each of which merits attention. Dr. H. L\u00fcderitz gives a collection of Moroccan proverbs, together with a commentary in the North Moroccan dialect and a German translation.\n\nProfessor Sachau, Principal of the Seminary, has contributed a study on the sect of the Ib\u0101dhite Mohammedans in Oman and Eastern Africa. His article is all the more welcome as comparatively little is known about them, and the information to be derived from Al Shahrist\u0101n\u012b is very scant and not always reliable. The interest attached to Ib\u0101dhite doctrines is not only historical, but also actual, as they still count many adherents both in Asia and Africa. The Ib\u0101dhites, who take their name from Abd All\u0101h b. Ib\u0101dh, are in reality but a group of the dissenters who are comprised under the more general term of Kh\u0101rijites, with whom they originated, and who sprang up after the assassination of the Khalifah Othm\u0101n. Having been scattered by Aliy in the battle of Nahraw\u0101n (658), they disseminated their belief during the subsequent years in six\ndiffering forms, only two of which have left any trace, viz. the puritan Azraqiyya (whose doctrines were revived in the last century by the Wahhabis) and the less fanatical Ib\u0101dhiyya (also called Wahbiyya). They were centralized by the above-mentioned Abd All\u0101h, who lived during the reign of the Khal\u012bfah Merw\u0101n I (died 685) and his successor Abd al Malik (died 705). The sources hitherto available for the study of Ib\u0101dhi doctrines have now been extensively supplemented by the abstracts given by Professor Sachau from the Kashf Al Ghumma, a work which contains a full history of the Ib\u0101dite movement up to the beginning of the eighteenth century. It contains two very instructive letters from Abd All\u0101h to Abd al Malik, of which a translation is to be found in this article. This is followed by a discussion on the religious tenets of the Ib\u0101dite belief, which offers some very interesting points of comparison with the Sunnite creed.\n\nThe next article, by W. Barthold, concerns Russian works on Western Asia. Dr. K. Foy contributes three articles, two of which treat on Turkish philology.\n\nDr. G. Kampffmeyer's very profound essay treats on the Bedouin dialects of Central Africa. Although the Arabic dialects spoken on the shores and islands of Asia and Africa have already been philologically investigated, those in the heart of the dark continent have had little attention paid to them. Even the large work of S. W. Koelle (\"Polyglotta Africana\") is barely more than nominally known to students of Arabic. Dr. Kampffmeyer has reprinted from Koelle's lists the portions relating to the Arabic dialects of Sh\u014da, Wadai, Adirar, and B\u00e9r\u0101n, and attached his own researches to them. In the latter he also discusses ethnographical questions, and gives valuable information on the wanderings of Arab tribes throughout Africa. An intimate acquaintance with the dialects spoken in the S\u016bd\u0101n is of special importance at the present time, and the comparatively greater facilities now open to students cannot fail to bring to light very interesting facts. Not only will it be possible to enlarge Koelle's lists compiled half a century ago, but also to gain important\nhistorical results. Not less interesting is it to observe that Arabs, beside occupying nearly the whole territory along the Nile, invaded Africa on two parallel routes on both borders of the Sahara. Dr. Kampffmeyer's suggestion that the immigration of (Southern) Arabs into the S\u016bd\u0101n took place independently from that which gained Northern Africa for them has much to recommend it. It coincides singularly with Dr. Glaser's theory regarding the early settlements of Southern Arabs in Abyssinia (\"Die Abessinier in Asien und Africa,\" 1895), the only difference being that the immigration of the latter took place at a much earlier epoch than either of the two others.\n\nDr. A. Fischer contributes two articles on Moroccan weapons and the accentuation of Moroccan words. To Persian studies are devoted two articles by Drs. L. v. Mutius and Oscar Mann. Dr. J. Horovitz gives a short notice on an alleged work by Al W\u0101qid\u012b. Finally, Dr. Julius Lippert has a lengthy review on Houdas' edition of the Chronicles of the S\u016bd\u0101n by Abderrahm\u0101n b. Abd All\u0101h b. Imr\u0101n b. Amir al-Sa'd\u012b.\n\nH. HIRSCHFELD.\n\nGLIMPSES OF OLD BOMBAY AND WESTERN INDIA. By James Douglas. (London, 1900.)\n\nIn this book the author of \"Bombay and Western India,\" published in 1893, gives us some more of his historical sketches and papers on events and life in and about Bombay in old and more recent times. They are quaintly and interestingly written as usual, and, in a variety of subjects, put on record many scraps of more than half forgotten history, for in India, where the European inhabitants are so often changing, personal recollections do not generally go back many years, and events are liable to be soon forgotten. As the author says in the preface, \"Bombay is a city of temporary habitation. Men and women come here and go away, and the place that knew them knows them no more. There is little of the continuity of tradition\nfrom father to son.\" But places change as well as men. Many buildings are swept away, and formerly well-known places so altered as to be forgotten, in the course of only a few years of city improvements. Works, therefore, such as those of Mr. Douglas are welcome to all who think of Bombay and Western India with happy memories, and are interested in the history of the establishment of the English in those parts and the progress of the 'Urbs prima in Indis.'\n\nIn each of the divisions of the book, viz., Social, Banks and Merchants, Roads by Sea and Land, Clubs, Biographical and Historical, papers well worth reading will be found, such as \"Bombay Domestic Annals, A.D. 1800-1893,\" \"Bombay before Joint Stock Banking,\" \"Across India in a Palkee,\" \"Aquaviva of Salsette,\" \"People whom India has forgotten.\"\n\nIt is hoped that this book will not be, as stated by the author, the last stone which he will heave on to the cairn of Old Bombay.\n\nO. C.\n\nRESEARCHES INTO THE ORIGIN OF THE PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS OF THE GREEKS, PHOENICIANS, AND BABYLONIANS. BY ROBERT BROWN, JUN., F.S.A., M.R.A.S. (Williams & Norgate, 1899.)\n\nThis is a really interesting book, in which the author has brought together a mass of material concerning the researches of the ancient nations named on the title-page into the wonders of the starry heavens. The value of the work consists, however, not only in the amount of material brought together, but also in the suggestive remarks that it contains concerning the origin of many of the signs of the constellations, and also the etymology of many an obscure and doubtful name.\n\nIn reading through his list of authorities, the wide reading of the author is at once evident. He has dived not only into the ancient Greek works on the subject\u2014in itself no light task\u2014but has also studied what Indian and Arabic\nworks on the subject have to say. The wedge inscriptions of Assyria and Babylonia have likewise provided him with many a comparison, and the coins of the ancient world have given him many a type\u2014indeed, he is able to state that every constellation-figure except Orion is represented on the coins of the ancients.\n\nThough much has been learned from the astrological tablets of Babylonia concerning the origin of the constellation-figures which we have inherited from the ancients, there is still much to learn and much to revise and correct before we can say that we know even approximately the true derivation of each. Of course, it is not to be supposed that every constellation-figure had a Babylonian or even an Oriental origin, for some of them are late, and were invented by the Greeks. This is shown by the constellation of the Tress, to which Mr. Brown calls special attention. The hair of Berenice, the queen of Ptolemy Euergetes, was made into a constellation about 243 B.C., \"by the united efforts of K\u00f4n\u00f3n, the astronomer of Samos, and Kallimachos, the Alexandrian grammarian-poet.\"\n\nMost, if not all, of the other constellation-figures, however, are Eastern, and originated either with the Phoenicians or the Babylonians (the Akkadians or Sumerians may be regarded as included in this term). Thus, the constellations of the Serpent, Cepheus, Perseus, Andromeda, etc., are apparently of Phoenician origin, whilst others, such as the Eagle, Lion, Scorpion, etc.\u2014in fact, most of the Signs of the Zodiac\u2014seem to be of Babylonian origin. There is so much, however, in Assyro-Babylonian astronomy that is unclear, that it may be regarded as certain that many of the ideas at present current upon the subject will have to be changed or modified with the fuller knowledge of the ancient Akkadian tablets referring thereto.\n\nFull use has been made of the discoveries of Epping from the tablets copied by Strassmaier, and these have been duly worked into the laborious study that Mr. Brown has published. For the solid basis laid by the late Father Epping, S.J., Assyriologists will always be grateful. The translation of\na number of tablets of late date written to a large extent\u2014in most cases entirely\u2014in abbreviations, was a triumph of perseverance and thought, whilst the working out of the ephemera and lunar tables by him was a marvel of patient and painstaking research.\n\nWhilst praising the work of Mr. Brown on account of the bringing together of so much material bearing upon ancient astronomy, it grieves me that I cannot follow him in much of what he says concerning the statements of the Assyro-Babylonian tablets bearing upon the subject.\n\nTo compare (p. 193) DA-AI-NU-TSI-ru \\(^1\\) (\u201cJudge supreme,\u201d W.A.I., IV, xxviii, l, Rev. l. 6) with Dionysos is bad enough, but when DI-WU-NIS-I (\u201cJudge-great-of-men,\u201d = the Sun-god, the grape-giver,\u201d W.A.I., II, IX, No. 2, l. 40) is put forward as another derivation of a form of the same word, one feels inclined to protest. The passage referred to, which is said to contain this form, has nothing of the kind. In reality the name of the god quoted is Silim-munzal (..., and is thus to be transcribed on account of the translation, N\u0101b\u016b, the mustarbar\u0101 salimu, \u201cNabo, the god forecasting peace,\u201d which accompanies it. Then, again, is the determinative prefix used for \u2018star\u2019 in later times in Babylonia, \u1d37iblings, really to be pronounced \u1d37iblings? Jensen has shown that the character here reproduced had also the value of gal, and the dialectic form of gal is m\u016bl, a homophone of m\u016bl meaning \u2018star.\u2019 \u1d37iblings is only, therefore, a character replacing \u1d37iblings..., m\u016bl, \u2018star,\u2019 \u2018constellation,\u2019 on account of its having fewer wedges and taking up less space. To all appearance, the constellation ..., mentioned in the tablet 83\u20131\u201318, 2434, is only the original form of the later \u1d37iblings \u1d37iblings, the constellation Taurus, an abbreviation of \u1d37iblings \u1d37iblings < \u1d37iblings \u1d37iblings \u1d37iblings \u1d37iblings, earlier \u1d37iblings \u1d37iblings \u1d37iblings < \u1d37iblings \u1d37iblings \u1d37iblings \u1d37iblings, the (apparently double) constellation of \u201cthe constellation\n\n\\(^1\\) In reality two words, \u1d37iblings \u1d37iblings.\n(par excellence) and the bull of heaven.\" This constellation is given as \\( \\text{mul-nulla} \\), in W.A.I., V, pl. 46, l. 26, and is there explained as kakku sa qat\u0101 Marduk, \"the weapon of the hands of Merodach.\" The description of \\( \\text{gud-anna} \\), \"the bull of heaven,\" as \"rimu issu\" (\"the strong wild bull\") in W.A.I., II, xlix, l. 45, I have been unable to find, but the explanation of the constellation which there appears has the two renderings, mesi le and laq\u0113 alpu, both meaning \"the jaw of the bull,\" or something of the kind. The so-called \"Te-tablet\" shows us that Taurus was originally two constellations, \"the constellation\" par excellence, or, perhaps, \"the bright constellation\" and \"the bull of heaven.\" The explanation of the bull of heaven as \"the jaw of the bull\" shows that the two original constellations had already become one at a very early date, that of the bull of heaven forming a portion only (the head) of the newly-combined group, identical, in the matter of its form, with the Bull\u2014Taurus\u2014of the Greeks and Romans, and also of the modern astronomer. With regard to the animal intended, there is every probability that the author is right in supposing that it was a humped bull, a variety with which the Babylonians were well acquainted.\n\nThe note upon the twins has excellent suggestions. The name of the month corresponding with this sign in Akkadian is, however, not mun-ga (\"the making of Bricks\"), but Segga (Sega), probably 'foundation.' In the occurrence of the two figures which the author has identified with the Twins on the cylinder-seals of Babylonia feet to feet or head to head, Mr. Brown sees a representation of the Sun and the Moon as twin brothers, constantly in rivalry\u2014the Moon being down when the Sun is up, and conversely.\n\n1 The full transcription of the Cuneiform characters would be Mul-mula \\( \\text{mul-gud-anna} \\). Another possible translation of the first two characters (mulnulla) is \"the bright star\" or \"constellation.\" In any case, \"the-bull-of-the-foundation,\" and the marvellous \"timuna-timmen-timne-tim-te ('foundation')\" on pp. 56, 57, fall to the ground.\n\n2 See Delitzsch's Assyrisches W\u00f6rterbuch, under lahd.\nIn these the constellation *Muslabbagalgal*, \"the great twins,\" is, he says, reduplicated, though the change of position indicated cannot apply to them. It is noteworthy that here, again, we have another instance of a double constellation, afterwards, to all appearance, united in one, for the so-called \"Te-tablet\" gives the sign for the month Sivan (represented by the character *sig*, an abbreviation of the Akkadian Segu already referred to) as Sib-z\u00ed-anna and Ma\u0161-tabba-galgal, \"the shepherd of the life of heaven\" and \"the great twins.\" It is not improbable that we may see, in the shepherd here referred to, the Sun-god Tammuz, smitten (as the Assyrian text has it, W.A.I., II, 49, l. 46) with the sword (*ina kakki mahsu*).\n\nBut to go fully through a work of this nature would require more time, and what is of still greater importance, more space, than I have at my disposal. The book is worthy of notice, and full of suggestions, on the Babylonian side as well as on every other. It has one great merit, and that is, that the references are generally given in full. On the other hand, there is one thing that is greatly needed, namely, an index, though, as the present is only the first volume, this want will probably be supplied when the work is completed.\n\nT.

J. Modi, who is a good Pahlavi scholar, presents his fellow-countrymen with a Gujarati transliteration of three short Pahlavi texts, each accompanied by Gujarati and English translations, with many useful notes. The three texts are a Memoir of Zarir, the brother of king Visht\u0101sp and commander-in-chief of his army, a Memorandum of the Cities of Iran and their traditional founders, or rebuilders, and a Memorandum of the wonders and greatness of the land of Sist\u0101n. Mr. Modi has also\nadded a reprint of his English articles about the Cities of Iran from the Journal of the B.B.R.A.S., and a map, showing the positions of the Cities mentioned.\n\nThese short treatises are the first three contained in an old Pahlavi codex, preserved in the library of the late Dastur Dr. Jamaspji Minoocheherji Jamaspasana at Bombay, which was written A.D. 1322; and it appears, from a colophon, copied in the middle of that codex, that the first half of the texts was copied from an old Broach MS. written A.D. 1255.\u00b9\n\nThe Memoir of Zarir gives an account of the origin, progress, and result of the holy war, or war of the religion, into which king Vi\u0161t\u0101sp was forced, shortly after his conversion to Zoroastrianism, by the interference of Arj\u0101sp, king of the Khy\u014dns, who objected to that conversion; but Vi\u0161t\u0101sp intrusted his reply to his brother Zarir, who handed a defiant dispatch to Arj\u0101sp's envoys, proposing a battle, to be fought two months later on the plains near the jungle of H\u016bt\u014ds and the M\u016brv of Zarat\u016bsht, a locality not easy to identify with certainty.\n\nOn this plain the armies of the two nations met, in fabulous numbers, at the appointed time; and, after a desperate battle, in which the Iranians lost most of their champions, including twenty-three brothers and sons of Vi\u0161t\u0101sp, the Turanian army was utterly destroyed, and Arj\u0101sp returned home alone, maimed and crippled, riding on a mutilated ass.\n\nWhen Professor W. Geiger (now of Erlangen) translated this Memoir into German in 1890,\u00b2 he pointed out several striking resemblances between its statements and those contained in Daqiqi's account of the same war in the Sh\u0101hn\u0101mah, which must have been derived from some Pahlavi Zarir-n\u0101mak then existing. It does not follow that this Memoir of Zarir, found in India, is the same work as\n\n\u00b9 A.Y. 624. The two ciphers, representing 600, have been eaten away by moths in the old codex, but a copyist, writing in A.Y. 1721, found one of these ciphers still legible, and wrote A.Y. 324; this would, however, be far too early.\n\n\u00b2 Sitzungsberichte der philos.-philol.

Thus the Pahlavi Zar\u012br can also be read Zargar, which can be traced to the Avesta Zairivairi (Yasht xiii, 101). The Av. Bastavairi (ibid., 103) has become Pahl. Bastvar, afterwards corrupted into Nast\u016br in the Sh\u0101hn\u0101mah, by wrong pointing. The Av. Spend\u014d-d\u0101ta (ibid.) has become Pahl. Spend-d\u0101t, afterwards corrupted into Isfandy\u0101r in Persian. And the Av. Frash-h\u0101m-vareta (ibid., 102) may be Pahl. Frash\u0101vart, otherwise Frash\u0101ngart.\n\nThe Memoir of Zar\u012br is an appropriate title for this treatise, as it is chiefly devoted to his warlike deeds, and, after his death, to those of his young son Bastvar. A colophon, which Mr. Modi has not translated, is appended to the original Pahlavi text of this Memoir, in which the writer of the codex explains that he copied this text from a copy made by his great-great-uncle from the Broach MS. of A.D. 1255 mentioned above; that is, he gives the old copyist's name, but not his date.\n\nThe memorandum of the Cities of Iran mentions more than fifty by name, and alludes to as many more. The names of their founders are evidently based upon such traditions as survived the Arab conquest; though the final founding of Bagd\u0101d by Ab\u016b J\u0101far, surnamed Dav\u0101nig, may very possibly be an addition to the original memorandum by some copyist. The translation seems fairly correct, though some doubts might be entertained about \u00a7\u00a7 19, 24, 31, if they were not dissipated by satisfactory explanations in the author's articles in the Journal of the B.B.R.A.S. In \u00a7 20 the cipher which is read \"ten hundred\" means \"one hundred\" in most cases.\nIn \u00a7\u00a7 47, 53 there occur some interesting particulars about the Jewish wife of king Yazdakard I, first noticed by Darmesteter in his *Textes pahlav\u00efa relatifs au Juda\u00efsme*. \u00a7 47 informs us that \"the cities of Sh\u00fbs and Sh\u00fbstar were built (or rebuilt) by Sh\u00eesh\u00een-d\u00fbkht, the wife of Yazdakard, son of Shahp\u00fbhar, as well as daughter of the R\u00eash-gal\u00fbtak ('chief of the exile'), the ruler of the Jews; she was also mother of V\u00e2hr\u00e2m-I G\u00fbr.\" \u00a7 53 also states that \"the city of Gai (ancient Ispah\u00e2n) was built by the accursed Alexander, son of Filip\u00f4sh; there was a settlement of Jews there in the reign of Yazdakard, son of Shahp\u00fbhar, brought by request of Sh\u00eesh\u00een-d\u00fbkht, who was his wife.\" No doubt Sh\u00eesh\u00een is a transcriber's variant of the Hebrew woman's name Susannah, as Mr. Modi mentions; and \"the lily\" was improved, as a name, by the Iranian addition of d\u00fbkht, converting it into \"the lily's daughter.\"\n\nThe memorandum of the wonders and greatness (or protectiveness) of the land of S\u00eest\u00e2n is a shorter treatise, which enumerates, among the advantages of this land, its possession of the Avesta river Ha\u00ebtamast, the lake Frazd\u00e2nav\u00e2, the sea K\u00e2sava, and the mountain Ushidarena; its being the scene of the birth and education of the last three apostles, and of the resurrection; also the land of the Kay\u00e2n dynasty, and refuge of the descendants of Airyu for ten generations; likewise the locality of Visht\u00e2sp's early promulgation of the religion, assisted by Zarati\u00ebht and S\u00ean\u00f4 of B\u00f4st. In Alexander's time it was the refuge of many of the faithful, and the preserver of some Nasks which are not clearly defined.\n\nThe translator has done his tedious work with good judgment and success, and there now remain untranslated only two or three texts of any length in this old codex, and these are more curious than important.\n\nE. W. West.\nThe comprehensive treatment of Vedic mythology begun by Professor Hillebrandt in 1891 with *Soma und verwandte G\u00f6tter*, he now continues in a second volume, which treats of the deities U\u1e63as, Agni, and Rudra. No other Sanskritist can be said to be so well equipped for a task like the present one. For to the very extensive acquaintance with Vedic mythology proved by his published works, Professor Hillebrandt joins an unequalled knowledge of ancient Indian ritual. Such knowledge, which furnishes much valuable material to the mythologist, the author of the present volume draws upon at every turn in illustration or corroboration of his conclusions. This very familiarity with the ritual literature, however, seems in some cases to have suggested identifications which remind one of those occurring in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, and which lack the support of substantial evidence. Such, for instance, is perhaps the explanation of the \"path of the gods\" (*devay\u0101na*) and that of the fathers (*pitry\u0101na*) as the northern (*uttaray\u0101na*) and the southern (*dak\u1e63inay\u0101na*) course of the sun respectively (p. 82).\n\nThe introduction, meant for both the present volume and for the third, which has yet to appear, contains many observations well worthy of consideration. The main principle which the author follows in his researches is, as he tells us, to interpret the Veda as much as possible from itself and, in so doing, to avoid starting with a theory (p. 11). Classical Sanskrit or P\u0101li, no less than Anthropology, should, he adds, be treated only as auxiliaries, not as guides. He does not agree with those scholars who, in consequence of a somewhat exaggerated reaction against the methods of comparative mythology, tend to efface the boundary-line between Sanskrit literature and the Veda. And, indeed, the Rigveda cannot be said to be a purely Indian work in the same sense as, for instance, the *Raghuvam\u015ba* of Kalid\u0101sa was after two thousand years of\nnational development. For the Rigveda, standing at the beginning of that development, must necessarily have contained much that was not Indian among its inherited material. The closely allied mythology and cult of the non-Indian Avesta is consequently capable, in many instances, of shedding more light on cognate points in the Rigveda than the indigenous literature may be able to do after the transforming influences of two thousand years and more. The gap between the Rigveda and the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as is already considerable; how much greater must be the gap between it and the later literature after the lapse of another millennium?\n\nAs for comparative mythology, Professor Hillebrandt expresses the belief that we can expect very little help from that quarter. In deciding mythological questions he has, therefore, never allowed the etymology of the names of gods to exercise any influence. Even if correct\u2014and of this we can rarely be certain\u2014the etymology is, in most cases, mythologically useless. The meaning it furnishes is, as a rule, so general that it may designate a number of different things, and therefore gives no clue to the individual character of the god in question. Thus, if we did not otherwise know that S\u016brya means the sun, the etymology could not tell us.\n\nProfessor Hillebrandt adheres to the view that the Vedic gods are nearly all personifications of natural phenomena. He is unable to accept the view which recognizes a number of abstract deities, such as the \u2018Stimulator God\u2019 (otherwise the solar deity Savit\u1e5b), or the euhemeristic interpretation which assumes the apotheosis even of racehorses in the Rigveda.\n\nProfessor Hillebrandt half apologizes for his standpoint not being new. More harm is, however, done by advancing novel theories based on insufficient evidence, or by accepting them without adequate criticism, than by adhering to old ones till they have been clearly rendered untenable. Within the limits indicated, the author, at the same time, takes up a good many new positions, some of which are certain to\nbe assailed with sharp criticism. Such, for instance, is his interpretation, in the first section, of U\u1e63as as not only the dawn of the single day, but as the beginning of the year. He has, however, made a distinct advance in this section towards establishing various points which have hitherto been doubtful. Thus he makes it clear (pp. 35\u201339) that the cows of Dawn never mean morning clouds in the Rigveda (cf. my Vedic Mythology, p. 47, last line but one). The evidence he adduces on pp. 41\u201342 makes the view very probable that Sury\u0101 is really a mythological synonym of U\u1e63as, and not the Sun regarded as a female. His conclusion (pp. 44\u201347) that Night and Morning are meant by the two wives of Vivasvat (the Sun), in two much-disputed stanzas of the Rigveda (X, 17, 1\u20132), seems to be more probable than any other interpretation hitherto advanced. The second, Sarany\u016b, is here described as \u201cof like aspect\u201d (sacar\u1e47\u0101), and as becoming the mother of the A\u015bvins. These statements are illustrated by the passage relating to the Indian Dioskouroi quoted by Y\u0101ska in the Nirukta (12, 2), where it is said that one of them is the son of the morning twilight, the other the son of the dawn. That Saram\u0101 is the mythological equivalent in the Rigveda of Sarany\u016b and U\u1e63as (pp. 48\u201350) is also probable. Professor Hillebrandt further seems to be clearly right in identifying with Dawn the Vir\u0101j (the effulgent One) of the Atharvaveda, whose two calves rise out of the sea and who is brought into connection with the sacrifice. This conclusion is, I may add, confirmed by the Rigveda, where Dawn is said (I, 113, 2) to have a shining calf (the sun), and Sun and Moon are alluded to as going round the sacrifice like playing children (X, 85, 18).\n\nThe main part of the book (pp. 57\u2013178) is devoted to the Fire-god, Agni, whose cult has been uninterruptedly maintained in India for more than 3,000 years down to the present day.\n\nIt is generally acknowledged that the three sacrificial fires of the later Indian ritual were known to the Rigveda, though the only one of their names occurring there is G\u0101rhapatya.\nProfessor Hillebrandt endeavours to prove that the two names of Agni, Nar\u0101s\u0101mpa and Vai\u015bv\u0101nara, are used in the Rigveda to designate the Dak\u1e63ina or Southern (p. 105) and the \u0100havaniya or Eastern Fire (p. 114) respectively; but his arguments do not seem to me to be at all convincing. He is more successful in showing that each of the three sacrificial fires represents one of the forms of Agni, the sun being the \u0100havaniya, while the terrestrial Agni is the G\u0101rhaspatya and the aerial Agni the Dak\u1e63ina. He points out how the explanations of the later texts, as well as the ritual practice, support this conclusion (p. 99). The latter is further borne out by the shapes of the fireplaces described in the \u015aulva S\u016btras. The shape of the \u0100havaniya is square (= heaven), that of the G\u0101rhaspatya is round (= earth), while that of the Dak\u1e63ina is generally described as like a half-moon or a bow (= air). It is natural to suppose that each was meant to represent the form of one of the three worlds. The Dak\u1e63ina fireplace must therefore have been intended to represent the shape of the air as an arch, and not, as Professor Hillebrandt thinks, to symbolize the moon.\n\nThe latter view is due to his theory that the third or aerial form of Fire is not lightning, but the moon (p. 95). That the poets of the Rigveda, by their frequent references to Agni in the aerial waters, meant lightning, is not only a very natural inference, but is the regular opinion of the native interpreters. Vidyut, the ordinary name for lightning, could, as a feminine word, hardly have been personified as a form of fire; the poets of the Rigveda therefore contented themselves with speaking of \u201cAgni in the waters\u201d or the \u201cChild of Waters.\u201d That the lightning issuing from the rain-charged cloud constituted a form of actual fire, was a matter of constant experience, and was symbolized in the ritual by using the wood of trees struck by lightning to kindle the sacrificial fire (p. 85). How much more probable, then, it is that the water Agni should mean lightning, and not the moon, with which heat and burning are never associated in the Veda, and which, on the contrary, is typical of cold in the later literature. Not only are the aerial Agni\nand the Child of Waters (Ap\u016bm nap\u0101t) the moon to Professor Hillebrandt, but also the gods Brhaspati and Yama. In connection with the water Agni, I cannot help thinking that Professor Hillebrandt is right in disagreeing with Geldner's opinion (*Vedische Studien*, ii, p. 271) that the submarine fire of the later mythology was known to the Vedas. There can be no doubt that that notion was historically connected with the Vedic Agni in the aerial ocean, and arose from one of those numerous misinterpretations of ancient mythology which brought down celestial phenomena to the lower world, and which, for instance, transformed the heavenly Varu\u1e47a into an Indian Neptune.\n\nThe chapter on Agni concludes with the discussion of mythological families associated with the fire-cult. In my *Vedic Mythology* (p. 143) I had inclined towards the interpretation of the Angirasas as originally demi-gods; but after what Professor Hillebrandt says (p. 169), the balance of the evidence seems to me now to favour the view that they were once a real family as well as the Bh\u1e5bgus (p. 173).\n\nThe last chapter (pp. 181\u2013208) deals with the god Rudra. Here a considerable amount of evidence is adduced which at all events narrows down the possibilities of correctly interpreting the original character of this deity. It is pretty clear that the theory which recognizes in Rudra the chief of the souls of the dead, finds no direct support from the Rigveda. It is also sufficiently evident that the special connection of Rudra with mountains is not Rigvedic, but is a result of that later mythological tendency to localization which appears, for example, in the case of the Gandharvas and Apasuras, and of which there are so many instances in the Avesta. Professor Hillebrandt has collected a large number of passages (p. 194) showing that all our later Vedic texts declare Rudra to be a form of fire, and of fire in its 'terrible' form. This evidence appears to strengthen the conclusion at which I had arrived several years ago, that Rudra \"originally represented not the storm pure and simple, but rather its baleful side in the destructive agency...\"\nof lightning\" (*Ved. Myth.*, p. 77). In discussing this view Professor Hillebrandt remarks (p. 198) that Rudra, though the father of the storm-gods, need not himself be a storm-god. This observation is perfectly correct, but only with certain reservations. For instance, when Dawn is called the daughter of the Sky, it is clear she is not identical in character with her father. But when Rudra is the father of the Maruts in the sense of being their chief\u2014they are often called Rudras\u2014the case is different. And that the father in this case, as a matter of fact, resembles the sons, is, I think, sufficiently apparent from the material collected in my *Vedic Mythology*. Professor Hillebrandt himself concludes (p. 196) that the angry Agni-Rudra is the god of the hot and rainy season, the most dangerous time of the year. If he means that this is the primary character of Rudra, I cannot help believing that such a notion is not in accord with the mode of thought of the Rigvedic poets.\n\nTill reading Professor Hillebrandt's book I had never clearly realized how Rudra's name came to be changed in the later mythology. Passages which he quotes show that direct mention of Rudra's name began to be avoided in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as. Stories are here told of his having been nameless at first, and only afterwards having received from Praj\u0101pati the numerous appellations by which he is known. Among these \u015aiva doubtless became fixed as his regular name, because this was his most euphemistic epithet.\n\nThe book ends with an appendix on Soma (pp. 209\u2013240), in which the author defends against various attacks the lunar theory put forward by him in the first volume. As is well known, the ordinary view is that the god Soma represents in the Rigveda a personification of the terrestrial plant and juice of the daily ritual, just as Agni is a personification of the sacrificial fire. It is further usually held that, according to the old and regular Rigvedic notion, the celestial Soma, being the counterpart of the terrestrial beverage, is drunk by Gods and Manes in the highest solar region, but that the transition to the later belief is to be found in the mystical allusions of some of the more recent\nhymns, in which the celestial Soma is beginning to be localized in and identified with the moon. For in one of these later hymns (X, 85, 3) this identification is alluded to as a secret known only to Brahmans. The development of this notion probably went hand in hand with the separation of the world of the gods, associated with the sun, from the world of the Manes, now connected with the moon, which we find in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Upani\u1e63ads.\n\nProfessor Hillebrandt, on the other hand, holds that the god Soma is the moon in every part of the Rigveda, the terrestrial plant being only a symbolical representation of the luminary, and the manipulation of the plant on the sacrificial ground being only a mimicry of celestial processes. The moon, according to him, is the centre of Vedic belief and dominates ancient Indian thought, the sun occupying only a subordinate position in it. His theory as thus formulated in the previous volume he now slightly modifies with reference to the position of Agni. For he now says: \"With Agni Soma dominates Indian thought\" (p. 212). Having collected the evidence on the subject of Soma in the Rigveda with considerable care, and having reflected on it with a good deal of attention, I am still constrained to regard the received theory, old though it be, as the more probable. Thus the roaring of Soma (like that of Agni) seems to be more easily explained as a hyperbolical description of the sound of the flowing Soma, than as an attribute of the moon. The case for the latter view is not much strengthened by stating the mere fact that a certain savage tribe speaks of the moon as roaring. For that tribe very likely regards the moon as some kind of animal to which roaring is natural. Even the sun does not roar in the Rigveda, though explicitly recognized as a form of Agni. Yet, I believe, it would be easier to explain Soma, from the Rigveda itself, as the sun rather than the moon. For Soma is often described in words applicable to the sun, and its brilliance is frequently associated with S\u016brya, while Soma is never expressly connected with Candramas, the moon. Again, quite as good a case as Professor Hillebrandt's lunar theory\nof Soma could be made out for the god Agni meaning only the sun, with which he is, as I have said, sometimes explicitly identified, while Soma is never in the Rigveda expressly stated to be the same as the moon. Professor Hillebrandt's defence does not seem to me to weaken materially the main arguments against his theory. One of the most powerful objections to it is this: How is it that all the Vedic commentators in whose day Soma and the moon were believed to be one, do not know that Soma means the moon in the Rigveda also? This objection he does not answer.\n\nHaving studied Professor Hillebrandt's book with no less profit than interest, I much regret that I am unable to agree with his conclusions in regard to several questions, especially as I feel that I am at least as likely to be mistaken about them as he. There can, however, be no doubt that his work forms an important contribution to the mythological studies of the Veda, no less by the stimulating effect it will have on research than by the new material which it supplies.\n\nA. A. Macdonell.\n\nThe Mysteries of Chronology. By F. F. Arbuthnot.\n\n(London, A.D. 1900 and v.e. 64.)\n\nMr. Arbuthnot has produced a most entertaining and, in many respects, a very instructive work. Without the slightest pretension to erudition or scientific accuracy\u2014indeed, in a too modest preface the author goes so far as to dub his own creation \"this very slipshod work\"\u2014\"The Mysteries of Chronology\" yet contains a wonderful amount of curious and interesting information concerning the various methods of dating which have prevailed at different periods and in different countries; and it is written in an easy colloquial style which makes the reader feel almost as if he were having a chat with the author. No one can read this book without pleasure, and few indeed without learning many a fact both new and unexpected. In pursuit of this\nout-of-the-way lore Mr. Arbuthnot has been indefatigable. Not satisfied with ransacking the British Museum, the Record Office, Westminster Abbey, the Tower, and every other promising hunting-ground at home, he has carried his investigations in person to Paris, Berlin, Z\u00fcrich, Vienna, Rome, Copenhagen, Stockholm, and St. Petersburg; and he has done well in putting on record the varied and curious knowledge thus acquired. One of the most interesting chapters in the book is \"about the date of the introduction of Arabic numerals into Europe.\" Of course, the main facts were perfectly well known before; but Mr. Arbuthnot has done good service in noting in detail all the earliest occurrences of these numerals in manuscripts, monuments, and coins. The discovery of the earliest date in Arabic numerals occurring on a coin\u2014viz. 1424 on a Swiss coin of St. Gall\u2014was made quite independently by Mr. Arbuthnot and Mr. C. R. Peers, who gives a description of it in the Numismatic Chronicle for 1899, p. 26. What most astonishes us now is the very slow acceptance of the new system of notation: a gap of between forty and fifty years divides this coin from the next known specimen having Arabic numerals.\n\nIf we are to believe Mr. Arbuthnot, the chronology of English History is in a parlous state. He will accept as certain only the dates from Henry VII onwards; that is to say, evidence of the kind to satisfy him is not forthcoming before that period. His sheet-anchor is really the London Gazette: as for the monkish histories and the chronicles generally, he eyes them one and all with suspicion. This is indeed scepticism, and few people will go quite so far with the author as to reject everything that the monks wrote, because they are known to have embellished their tales in many instances. Fewer still will be inclined to accept his prophylactic against chronological confusion in the future. This is neither more nor less than to make a clean sweep of the present A.D. system which has given us so much trouble, and to begin again and start a new era from a point which is beyond dispute\u2014the first year of the\nAccording to this reckoning we should now be in the 64th year of the Victorian Era. This is a patriotic proposal, but is it practical? Can we imagine our friends on the Continent, for instance, adopting it\u2014at the present time above all? Might it not make our \"splendid isolation\" rather too splendid?\n\nE. J. Rapson.\n\nGandhara Sculptures (Some Recent Acquisitions). By James Burgess, C.I.E., etc.\n\nIn the number of The Journal of Indian Art and Industry for January, 1900 (vol. viii, No. 69), Dr. Burgess continues the very important work of publishing such specimens of Gandhara Sculpture as come under his notice. The \"recent acquisitions\" with which he deals on the present occasion are chiefly in the British Museum and in the Indian Museum at Calcutta. For these the Indian Museum is principally indebted to the excavation of an ancient stupa found at Taxila or Tanga, in the Swat valley, carried out by order of the Bengal Government. They possess an additional merit from the fact that their provenance is known and that they were found together. As Dr. Burgess rightly says, it is unfortunate for the study of these sculptures that they have, as a rule, been excavated in a perfectly haphazard manner. In many cases, no record has been kept of the locality in which a specimen has been found, and we never make of the relations which different specimens bear to one another in cases where several have been found together. Questions of chronology, and, no doubt, questions of interpretation also, are infinitely more difficult if we are to work without the aid of these most important clues.\n\nThis paper contains illustrations, by means of blocks executed by Mr. W. Briggs and inserted in the text, of many beautiful and interesting examples not previously\npublished; but, perhaps, its chief importance lies in the explanations given of some of the scenes represented. In this respect, Dr. Burgess is to be congratulated on having made a real advance in the study of the subject. His explanation of the Mah\u0101parinirv\u0101\u1e47a, for instance, is full of new information about the characters who make up this scene and the attributes which distinguish them. His account, also, of the manner in which the Br\u0101hma\u1e47ical deities, who play an important part in the earliest Buddhist legends, are developed at a later period into Buddha's attendants is most instructive. There can be little doubt that these monuments are destined in the future, when more accurate criteria for dating them have been obtained, to throw great light on the history of Northern Buddhism.\n\nAt present it is impossible to identify many of the Bodhisattvas as they are represented on the sculptures, and it is doubtful whether this impossibility will ever be overcome in some instances. A very useful account of those of them who may be distinguished by different attributes is given by Dr. Burgess on p. 85.\n\nOn p. 89, Dr. Burgess gives us M. Senart's account of a Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi inscription, dated in the year 318, which occurs on the base of a statue found at Loriy\u0101n. At first sight this would seem to be the latest date known from a Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi inscription; but M. Senart gives good reasons why the reading of the date 284 on the Ha\u1e63\u1e6dinagar pedestal should be corrected to 384. It may be mentioned incidentally that the same correction has been made independently by a young Swedish scholar, Mr. A. V. Bergny, in an article on Br\u0101hm\u012b-Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi coin-legends, which, it is hoped, will appear in the next number of our Journal. As Dr. Burgess points out, the era of these dates is probably the old M\u0101lwa or so-called Vikram\u0101ditya era, dating from B.C. 57. This conclusion, which first seemed probable from a comparison of what is known from other sources of the date of Gondophares, with the inscription which gives his twenty-sixth year as year 103 of the era, is supported by every subsequent discovery.\nDr. Burgess concludes his article with a bibliography of works on Gandh\u0101ra sculptures, which will be most useful. We shall look forward with great interest to his forthcoming English edition of Gr\u00fcnwedel's Buddhisitische Kunst in Indien, in which account will be taken of the discoveries which have been made since the appearance of the German work.\n\nR.

OBITUARY NOTICE.\n\nSir William Wilson Hunter, K.C.S.I., C.I.E., LL.D.,\nVice-President of the Asiatic Society.\n\nSir William Hunter, whose untimely death may be said with truth to have been a national loss, was born at Glasgow on July 15th, 1840. He was not the first member of his family to exhibit great powers of application and mastery of complicated detail. The Right Hon. James Wilson, his maternal uncle, wrote with rare acumen on currency and national economy, and was charged by the British Government with the task of reorganizing the finances of India, reduced to chaos by the Mutiny. Of his boyhood there are but few memories. He passed from the Academy of Glasgow to the University, and thence to Paris and Bonn, enjoying the best training which Scotland and the Continent could bestow. It developed and stimulated his great natural abilities, and in 1862 he took the first place in the Open Competition for admission to the Civil Service of India. At the end of the following year he married the daughter of the Rev. Thomas Murray, LL.D., a Scottish antiquarian of note and a bosom friend of Carlyle. In marriage, says Marion Crawford, it makes all the difference in life whether a man castles on the King's side or the Queen's. Mr. Hunter, in giving hostages to fortune at the very dawn of his career, secured a helpmeet who was devoted to his material and intellectual interests, who\ngave him what very few young Indian civilians enjoy\u2014a refined home and freedom from those petty cares which so often sap the finest powers. Many years there were of enforced separation, for the children's early training demanded their mother's constant care. But Lady Hunter retained her gentle influence throughout her distinguished husband's life. She was his constant companion when the kindly fates brought them together; his amanuensis, his trusted critic. Nothing was more charming than the old-fashioned courtsey with which he treated her who had shared his early struggles and rejoiced with him when success and honours came. The young couple set up a house at Suri, a pretty Bengal station on the borders of the Santal highlands. Here the glamour of the East took possession of him, and inspired him with a resolve to interpret its poetry and grandeur to the English people. For materials he delved in governmental record-rooms and searched the archives of native magnates: the pundit, the artificer, the peasant yielded their treasured lore and tradition. During a visit paid to England in 1868 he gave the world the fruit of his enquiries in the \"Annals of Rural Bengal.\" This great work placed him at once in a prominent rank at a time when the giants of early Victorian literature were still in our midst. The grace and steady flow of the writing, said a distinguished critic, make us almost forget the surpassing severity and value of the author's labours. Even in India, where literary power is but little appreciated, this wonderful book made some impression; and on Mr. Hunter's return to duty he was called to the Bengal Secretariat, passing in due course to that of the Government of India. It has been said with truth that every man has his chance in life, and that the earlier it occurs, and is grasped, the more likely it is to bring fame and fortune. Mr. Hunter's was the advent as Viceroy of Lord Mayo, a statesman who possessed warm and extended sympathies, coupled with the rarer gift of ability to discern excellence in his subordinates. He soon detected unique capacity in the young Under-Secretary,\nand created for his benefit the post of Director-General of Statistics. This amazing promotion excited comment and not a little jealousy among Mr. Hunter's colleagues; but it was amply justified by results. He took the Indian Census of 1871 as the basis of a work which had often been attempted in vain by the defunct East India Company, and in the \"Statistical Account of Bengal and Assam,\" in twenty-two volumes, gave the English official a sweeping view of the geography and economic condition of a province as large as France with nearly twice her population. The plan of this gigantic work was entirely his own: for its execution he depended to a great extent on local officers. His power of impressing his personality on others was shown at this early period, and a master mind shines clearly in every page of the undertaking. In the meantime Mr. Hunter was planning a still greater feat\u2014that of doing for the Indian Empire what he had accomplished for a single province. In 1880 appeared the \"Statistical Survey of India,\" in 128 volumes, including 60,000 pages, which, in the following year, was compressed into the \"Imperial Gazetteer of India,\" in fourteen volumes. The sixth, an enlarged edition of which appeared in 1885, was issued separately as the \"Indian Empire: its Peoples and Products.\" It is the sublimated essence of the \"Gazetteer,\" and was hailed in England and on the Continent as worthy of the vast fabric which the author alone could have described. In 1875 he produced in two volumes a life of his patron, the Earl of Mayo. It was a labour of love, and brings into high relief the loss sustained by the Empire in that great man's assassination. There are few passages in the whole range of letters more pregnant with dramatic power than the story of his tragic end. \"Orissa, an Indian Province under English Rule\" appeared in 1872, and recorded the impressions gathered by its author during a brief employment as Inspector of Schools in Southern Bengal. It was generally considered to have attained a still higher level than his earlier flight. In 1883 a \"Brief History of the Indian Peoples\" was published, and at once\nobtained immense popularity, passing into twenty editions. Mr. Hunter's versatility was now destined to shine in another sphere. In 1881 he became a Member of the Legislative Council of India, and in the following year was President of the Education Commission, a body of experts, whose report\u2014a model of luminous eloquence\u2014is the basis of our entire system of instructing Indian youth. In 1884 he was sent home to give evidence before a Parliamentary Committee on Indian Railway development; and, on his return to Calcutta two years later, he became a Member of the Indian Famine Commission. In 1887 he received the honour of K.C.S.I.\n\nWeimar had hitherto been his home during furlough. It is well-nigh the last of Germany's minor courts; and the traces of feudal pomp and circumstance, the old-world ceremony still maintained there, appealed to the poetio side of his nature. On the other hand, Sir William Hunter's genial manners made a great impression on his German friends. Long was he known at Weimar as \"the Englishman who drives,\" for he was an accomplished whip, and a seat on the box of his mail phaeton was eagerly sought for. Soon after his retirement from official duties, he settled down at Oxford, a city which offers unrivalled advantages to the man of letters. The University received him with open arms. He became an Honorary Master of Arts of Balliol, Examiner in the Honours' School of Oriental Studies and a Member of the Faculty of Arts. But he soon forsook the green Cherwell's banks for a small estate which he purchased in the parish of Cumnor. Here, at the edge of Lord Abingdon's glorious woods, and on a sunny slope which overlooks the great central plain of England, he built a mansion which he destined, like another Abbotsford, to shelter his remote descendants. Henceforward his leisure was devoted to embellishing \"Oaken Holt,\" which under his loving care became the model of a refined English home. Sir William Hunter was never seen to greater advantage than in this creation of his ingenuity and consummate taste. The graceful hospitality of Oaken Holt, the hearty welcome\ngiven to all comers by its hosts, will long live in the memory of those who were privileged to enjoy them.\n\nIn pursuit of his fixed resolve to make India something more than an abstraction for the English people, he planned a series of biographical studies, styled the \"Rulers of the Empire.\" This he inaugurated with a memoir of Lord Dalhousie, which displays the writer's marvellous power of projecting himself into the minds of other men, so to speak, and seeing things with their eyes. He also furnished an abridged edition of his biography of Lord Mayo, and a revised one of his \"Brief History of the Indian Peoples.\" He had intended to add a life of Aurangzib, but, on learning that Mr. Stanley Lane Poole was engaged on a similar theme, Sir William made over to him the whole manuscript material which he had collected. Generosity so rare merited the acknowledgment which was gracefully tendered in Mr. Lane Poole's preface to his \"Aurangzib.\" New light was thrown on the internal mechanism of the Empire by Sir William Hunter's \"Bombay, 1885-90, a Study in Indian Administration\"; and those who seek to understand a highly complex land system have to thank him for four volumes of \"Bengal MS. Records,\" published in 1894, a selected list of more than 14,000 letters stored in the archives of the Calcutta Board of Revenue. But his literary energies found scope in directions which are seldom sought by economists and statisticians. The \"Old Missionary\" belongs unmistakeably to the Literature of Power. It is full of a strange, haunting sweetness which moves to admiration and tears. The \"Thackerays in India\" is another work of singular fascination. Sir William Hunter regarded the memory of our chief novelist with a veneration of which only the greatest minds are capable. An exquisite statuette of his hero stood close to the writing-table at Oaken Holt, and seemed to inspire his noblest efforts. His last great literary work was one which he had kept steadily in view throughout a laborious career. It was to have been a history of India from the earliest ages; but the loss by shipwreck of a mass of priceless MS. compelled him to\nreduce his canvas and portray the growth of an organism which is the wonder and envy of mankind. The first volume of the \"History of British India\" appeared in March, 1899, and was on all sides acknowledged as worthy to rank with Gibbon's immortal picture of the latter days of the Caesars' sway. A second volume was nearly ready for the press when the writer's busy hand was stayed by death. If he had lived but a few weeks longer the record would have been carried down to the union of the rival East India Companies at the dawn of the eighteenth century. This period dealt with is, indeed, the obscurest portion of the Indian annals. But what might not have been ours had that brilliant pen been permitted to describe the impact of Western strength and knavery on the effete empire of the Moghul; to depict Clive's meteor career and the peaceful conquests of Hastings and Cornwallis! Dis aliter visum. The \"History of British India\" will remain a magnificent fragment, for who shall bend Achilles' bow?\n\nMuch is a brief and by no means exhaustive account of Sir William Hunter's permanent literary works. They would fill a respectable library; and, such is the prerogative of genius, there is not a page of his many thousands which he wrote or planned but bears the stamp of his individuality. His achievements as a journalist would in themselves have satisfied most men's aspirations. His spurs were won in the Indian Press, and in 1873-5 he furnished a weekly summary of Indian events to the Pall Mall Budget. He began to write for The Times in 1887, contributing two memorable series of essays on Burma and the \"India of the Queen.\" Three years later he joined the staff of the leading journal; and his weekly articles on \"Indian Affairs\" were looked for eagerly by all who sought to follow the trend of events in our great dependency.\n\nGenius differs from mere talent in that it is spontaneous, and, in a manner, independent of will power. Sir William Hunter was ever conscious of a voice within urging him to accomplish some task which should benefit his country and win him literary fame. He often said that his ideal\nof happiness was useful work, honestly done. I am informed by his devoted friend and secretary, Mr. P. E. Roberts, that the daily labour at Oaken Holt began at a quarter to 10 and continued without any intermission till 2 p.m. Sir William then lunched, and after another hour and a half in his library, he rode in the shady woods bordering \"Oaken Holt\" or the pleasant highways which stretched on either side. On his return at half-past 5 he read till the dinner hour. Like Buckle, the author of the \"History of Civilization,\" he was wont to saturate his mind with the literature of the epoch which he was about to treat. This process completed, he wrote rapidly and with few pauses for thought or correction. No pains were spared by him in the verification of facts. The vast body of notes in the first volume of the \"History\" is a monument of patient research; and it is literally true that every statement in that work was based on a close examination of the original documents. Thus the author went to Lisbon, in the Autumn of 1898, in order to ransack the national archives for information bearing on Portuguese India, though this was but a side issue. The records of our India Office and those at the Hague underwent a similar process before being condensed into a history of the Dutch Settlements. The story of his search for the missing charter granted by Cromwell to the East India Company would form an interesting chapter in a new edition of the \"Curiosities of Literature.\" It must not be supposed that this prodigious application, this conscientious treatment of a mass of dry and often repellent detail lessened Sir William's capacity for enjoyment. He warmed both hands at the fire of life, and entered with a boyish zest into the delights which this beautiful world affords. But there was not a particle of selfishness in his composition. He took his pleasures neither sadly nor alone. Never was he more completely in his element than when he was the centre of a group of young people, and holding each beneath the spell of his sweet and sunny nature. A stranger drinking in the bright humour and anecdote which flowed from his\nlips in these too brief periods of relaxation, found it almost impossible to believe that he was in the presence of the grave historian, the author whose works had charmed and instructed a generation. Nor would the guest be intimidated by that tacit assumption of superiority which is so often exhibited by lesser men. He had his detractors: for mediocrity resents energy and superior power as reflections on itself. But so truly Christian was his charity that during a friendship of nearly twenty years never did I hear him speak harshly of those who had misunderstood and maligned him. Of domestic sorrows he had a full share. An only daughter, gifted with beauty and singular personal charm, was torn from her parents by death at the very dawn of womanhood; and his eldest son perished untimely in a distant land. And yet, though the father's heart bore the scars till it ceased to beat, he bravely subdued his grief for the sake of others. No stronger testimony to a man's sound worth can be borne than by those who speak well of him after daily intercourse. The aged Vicar of Cumnor told his flock on the Sunday after this great and good man had been laid to rest, that all of them had witnessed \"his unfailing courtesy to every rank, his wide sympathies, his readiness to give, his engaging cheerfulness, his compassion for the weak and helpless, his love of children.\"\n\nOf Sir William Hunter's last sad days I find it even now inexpressibly painful to write. There can be no doubt that a vigorous constitution and an intense vitality were undermined by the labour entailed by the \"History of British India.\" So consuming was his anxiety to complete the second volume on the date agreed upon that his afternoon rides were latterly abandoned, and he toiled in his library till far into the night. When, in the Spring of last year, he fell a victim to influenza, it left its mark in a perceptibly weaker heart action. Soon after Christmas he suffered a severe relapse of this most insidious malady. Coming to London before he was really convalescent in order to meet the great American humorist, Mr. S. L. Clemens, at dinner, he caught a chill which brought on pneumonia and increased\nthe cardiac weakness. At his earnest request he was carried tenderly to Oaken Holt, and Lady Hunter observed with joy a seeming improvement in his condition. But the springs of life were broken. After a few hours of insensibility he passed peacefully away at 3 o'clock on the morning of February 7th.\n\nThere is something tragic in this sudden termination of a noble career while its lifework was still undone, and the mental powers inspiring it were untouched by the hand of time. And yet such was the end which Sir William had always hoped. He had an instinctive horror of the gradual decay which is so often death's harbinger. The news was flashed through England at a time of national stress, when the silver lining to the cloud which overhung our destinies was the help rendered to the struggling mother country by her children beyond the seas. The feeling evoked in the thousands who knew him only by his works was voiced by Mr. Hutton, Select Preacher at St. Mary's, Oxford. \"At a time,\" he said, \"when we are eagerly welcoming every tie of person, history, race, and sentiment which can bind the empire together, the death of one who did so much to unite Englishmen to India in bonds of knowledge and sympathy is indeed a blow most deeply to be felt on public as well as personal grounds.\" So vivid, indeed, was his personality that those who loved him found it impossible at first to realize that they were fated no more to look into those kind eyes and grasp that hand held out in welcome. Their bitter thoughts found an echo in the Sanskrit Psalm of Life, which is among the many beauties of the \"Old Missionary\":\n\n\"Like driftwood on the sea's wild breast\nWe meet and cling with fond endeavour\nA moment on the same wave's crest.\nThe waves divide, we part for ever.\nWe have no lasting resting here:\nTo-day's best friend is dead to-morrow;\nWe only learn to hold things dear\nTo pierce our hearts with future sorrow.\"\n\nF. H. Skrine.\nIII. Notes and News.\n\nCinder Mounds.\u2014Mr. Beveridge draws our attention to a passage in Murray's Handbook, p. 224, col. 2, for the Panjab, where the writer (Mr. Eastwick) speaks of a place called Raik\u012b-ke-Tibbi, fifty miles north-east of Bah\u0101walpur, where mounds of calcined bones and charcoal were excavated by Colonel Minchin in 1874. This, he thinks, might throw light on the cinder heaps concerning which Mr. Sewell published a paper in the Journal, Part I, for 1899.\n\nInternational Congress on the History of Religions.\u2014This will be held at the Sorbonne in Paris, under the presidency of M. Albert R\u00e9ville, from the 3rd to the 9th of September, 1900. The subscription is 10 francs, and the address of the Secretariat is the Sorbonne. The program, which can be seen at our office, is most interesting; and we trust that the Congress may receive the support of as many of our members as possible.\nRoyal Asiatic Society.\n\nGOLD MEDAL FUND.\n\nIn 1897 the Council of the Royal Asiatic Society established a Jubilee Gold Medal, to be awarded every third year, as an encouragement to Oriental learning amongst English-speaking people throughout the world; and to meet the expense contributions were invited from those interested in the scheme.\n\nA beautiful design was prepared, and dies engraved, by Mr. Pinches; the first Medal was awarded, on the report of a Committee of Selection, to Professor Cowell, and was presented to him by Lord Reay at a Special General Meeting of the Society, the proceedings of which will be found reported in the Journal for July, 1898.\n\nThe subscriptions (including interest on deposits) amounted to \u00a3330 16s. 10d., and the disbursements (including cost of die) to \u00a369 5s. 10d., leaving a balance of \u00a3261 11s. 0d., of which sum \u00a3215 6s. 0d. was expended in the purchase of \u00a3200 Nottingham Corporation 3 per cent. Irredeemable Stock (a Trustee Stock), and there is therefore a balance in hand of \u00a346 5s. 0d. The amount invested forms the nucleus of an Endowment Fund; but as it is estimated that the cost of providing a Medal will amount to upwards of \u00a324, and as it is to be given every third year, the annual income required will be about \u00a38. To produce this another \u00a3100 Stock must be purchased, after providing the Medal for the present year. The deficiency is therefore about \u00a390.\n\nIt is hoped that this amount will be forthcoming during the next few months, so that on the presentation of the Medal in the Summer of 1900 it may be announced that the entire sum has been raised.\n\nContributions, which will be acknowledged in the Society's Journal, will be received by the Secretary, or the Chairman of the Committee of the Medal Fund.\n\nA.

XVI.\u2014Notes on some Br\u0101hm\u012b-Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b Inscriptions on Indian Coins. By A. V. BERGNY.\n\nThese notes are the result of a personal examination of Br\u0101hm\u012b-Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b inscriptions on coins published by Sir A. Cunningham in his Coins of Ancient India (London, 1891 = C.CAI. in the following pages), and now in the British Museum. I have selected here only those coins on which we find a Br\u0101hm\u012b inscription word by word confirmed by a Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b inscription. The best known of these biliteral coins are those of the Kunindas, to which I have devoted another monograph which I hope to publish shortly. In this monograph I enter more fully into the discussion of certain questions of phonetics, which equally affect the inscriptions dealt with in the present article. By examining and comparing the readings thus given in both alphabets, we may hope to obtain some definite results as to the decipherment of the various forms of each. In the first place, an account is given of these forms as they occur in each inscription, so that they may be compared with those already known from other sources, and their readings determined in accordance with results already obtained. As a rule, these inscriptions exactly correspond, syllable\nfor syllable, to each other. Such differences as do occur\u2014e.g., in case-forms, in vowels, in varied representations of the same sound\u2014are of great interest from the point of view of phonetics. I have constantly referred for forms of letters to Professor G. B\u00fchler's Palaeographical Tables given in his \"Grundriss der Indo-arischen Philologie,\" i, h. 11: Indische Palaeographie (Strasbourg, 1896); and for readings and photographs to R. J. Rapson's Indian Coins (in the same series, vol. ii, 3 h. B., 1898).\n\n**AUDUMARA COINS.**\n\nC. CAI., pl. iv, 1, or Rapson's IC., pl. iii, 8.\n\nI read this as follows:\u2014\n\n| 1. | 2. | 3. | 4. | 5. | 6. | 7. | 8. | 9. | 10. |\n|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|\n| Br\u0101hmi: | ma | h. | d. | va | sa | ra | \u1e47o | dha | ra | gho |\n| Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi: | \u2014 | ha | de | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n\n| 11. | 12. | 13. | 14. | 15. | 16. | 17. |\n|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| \u1e63a | sa | o | d.m | ba | ri | sa |\n\n| su | \u2014 | \u2014 | dum | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n\nNo. 7 = Br\u0101hmi \u1e47 and Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi \u1e47. Cf. R. O. Franke, ZDMG., vol. 50, p. 601.\n\nNo. 10 = Br\u0101hmi \u1e0d, is a varied form not given by B\u00fchler.\n\nNo. 11 = Br. \u1e63 (\u1e63a), Khar. \u1e6d (\u1e63u).\n\nNo. 14. There is a distinct dot on the right side of the Br\u0101hmi character, which evidently indicates the anusv\u0101ra. This seems to be a prototype of 23, col. xix, table iii, and is equivalent to the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi \u1e45 (dum), which is quite a new form, not hitherto recorded.\n\n---\n\n1 The scheme of tran-literation adopted here is that given in J.R.A.S., 1895, p. 880. The italics indicate such of my readings as differ from those of Cunningham or Rapson. A short stroke = ditto. A dot placed at the side of, or instead of, a character indicates an erasure partial or complete.\n\n2 My esteemed friend Professor R. O. Franke, in his lectures on Indian Palaeography given at Berlin in 1895, first made me aware of the fact that Cunningham's reading of letter No. 7 required correction.\nThe last letter sa, which represents the genitive termination of the word o-d(u)m-ba-ri-sa in the left-hand line, is here linked by a hyphen to the corresponding sign of the word dha-ra-gho-sa-sa in the right-hand line of the Br\u0101hm\u012b inscription. Cf. a closer combination of the two signs in the inscription of pl. iv, 5, given below.\n\nAs regards the other characters, it deserves to be mentioned that the Br\u0101hm\u012b forms of ma, va, and ra resemble those angular forms given in t. ii, coll. xx\u2013xxii (Mathur\u0101, etc.), and that the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b forms are those of the A\u015boka inscriptions of Sh\u0101hb\u0101zgarhi and Mansehra (t. i, coll. i\u2013v), with the exception of sa, which has its curve opened to the left.\n\nC. CAl., pl. iv, 5.\n\nBr\u0101hm\u012b inscription:\n\n1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14.\nbh. ga va to ma h\u0101 de va sa r\u0101 ja r\u0101 ja sa\n\nThe angular forms of va, ma, and h\u0101 and the round ga resemble those shown in t. ii, col. xx (Mathur\u0101), and t. iii, col. i (in the \u015ao\u1e0d\u0101\u015ba inscriptions of Mathur\u0101). The former have at their tops short horizontal strokes resembling the o-stroke of to, the \u0101-stroke of h\u0101 (and r\u0101), and the e-stroke of de.\n\nNos. 9 and 14 are combined into one form (sa, sa).\n\nA similar character occurs on a coin of Zoilos in the British Museum (Cunningham, 342); here the sa- terminations of tra-ta-ra-sa and jho-i-la-sa in Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b are combined so as to form one character (sa, sa). The first step towards this union of the two sa-forms belonging to different words (ma-ha-de-va-sa and rd-ja-r\u0101-ja-sa) is the hyphen mentioned above (pl. iv, 1).\n\nKharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b inscription:\n\n1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13.\nbha gu ru sa ma ha de cu sa ra ja ra na\nThe shape of these characters is nearly the same as that found in C. CAI., pl. iv, 1, discussed above. The u-stroke of Nos. 1, 3, and 8 is attached to the forms in precisely the same way as in the Asoka inscriptions. No. 2 exhibits a form \\( \\mathcal{P} \\) (gu), in which the u-stroke is attached to the side of the down-stroke just as in \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) (pu) of the word \\( a-pu-la-pha-na-sa \\) on the coin of Apollophanes in B.M. Cat., pl. xiii, 1, and in \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) (ku) of the word \\( pa-ku-ra-sa \\) on a coin of Pakores in the Berlin Mus. (xi, 1, 6; No. 26).\n\nAs regards the last word of the Br\u0101hm\u012b inscription, i.e. \\( ra-ja-ra-ja-sa \\), we need only refer to what has been already said about the double-form made by the union of letters Nos. 9 and 14. Apparently Cunningham took this double-form to be a single sa, and accordingly read the concluding word as 'r\u0101jar\u0101ja,' i.e. as a nominative instead of a genitive, like the other words in the inscription. As this would be an obvious violation of strict syntactical rules, the reading \\( ra-ja-ra-\u00f1a \\) has been suggested (cf. R.O. Franke, in ZDMG., vol. 50, p. 601). \\( Ra-ja-ra-\u00f1a \\) (transliterated by Cunningham as \\( ra-ja-ra-jna \\)) is the reading of the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b inscription; but there is no doubt that the reading of the letter No. 13 in the Br\u0101hm\u012b inscription is \\( ja \\) (cf. No. 11 on the phototype of pl. iv, 5). All difficulty vanishes when we know that the terminations of the two words \\( ma-ha-de-ra-sa \\) and \\( ra-ja-ra-ja-sa \\) are combined into one form.\n\nC. CAI., pl. iv, 6.\n\nThere is no specimen of this kind in the British Museum. My readings must therefore depend upon the accuracy of the photographic illustration.\n\n| 1. | 2. | 3. | 4. | 5. | 6. | 7. | 8. | 9. | 10. | 11. |\n|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|-----|\n| Br.: | \\( r\u016b \\) | \\( j\u00f1a \\) | \\( ve \\) | \\( ma \\) | \\( ki \\) | \\( sa \\) | \\( ru \\) | \\( dra \\) | \\( va \\) | \\( rma \\) | \\( sa \\) |\n| Khar.: | \\( ra \\) | \\( \u00f1a \\) | \\( ve \\) | \\( \u2014 \\) | \\( \u2014 \\) | \\( \u2014 \\) | \\( \u2014 \\) | \\( ru \\) | \\( (.)ma \\) | \\( \u2014 \\) |\n| 12. | 13. | 14. | 15. |\n| \\( (v)j \\) | . | . | . |\n| \\( vi \\) | \\( ja \\) | \\( ya \\) | \\( ta \\) |\nThe Br\u0101hm\u012b characters exhibit the same angular forms as those of C.CAI., pl. iv, 5, discussed above, horizontal strokes being attached to their tops. In regard to No 2 deciphered as j\u012bna, there might be some doubt whether the horizontal stroke in the middle of the ja ought not to be taken to denote \u0101, as is usual in earlier periods (cf. B\u00fchler's table ii, 15). But a comparison of similar instances shows that the vowel is undoubtedly short. For example, in pl. iv, 14, where the same sign occurs, it must stand for j\u012bna, because the context of the inscription, which is in pure Sanskrit, shows that the word is r\u0101j\u012bna\u2014a genitive (not an instrumental), with the visarga omitted as usual. This is further confirmed by the Kuninda inscriptions, where we find the variants r\u0101-\u00f1a (e.g. pl. v, 1) and r\u0101-\u00f1o used side by side with ra-j\u012bna, the j\u012bna being written with the stroke, as in pl. iv, 6 and 14. On the other hand, we find in the inscription of pl. iv, 15 (infra, p. 416), which seems to belong to the same period, an undoubted instance of j\u012bna with the \u0101-stroke clearly indicated; cf. also the P\u0101li inscription of the Mathur\u0101 coin, pl. viii, 14: ra-j\u012bna (not r\u0101j\u012bna) ra-ma-da-ta-sa.\n\nNos. 8 and 10 show the different ways of attaching the ra-stroke to the main character: when pronounced after the consonant of the compound it is attached below as in dra (No. 8); when pronounced before, it is placed above to the left as in rma (No. 10), \u1e47 (cf. t. iv, 43, c. viii). The Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi form of No. 8 (dra) has a distinct ra-stroke attached to the right, and that of No. 9 (ru) a distinct u-stroke bent upward. The e-strokes of both Br\u0101hm\u012b and Khar. letters are fairly distinct on No. 3.\n\nC.CAI., pl. iv, 7.\n\nThree specimens:\n\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Br.: | \u1e47o | a | ja | mi | ta | sa |\n\nFor varieties of j\u012bna see table ii, 42, c. xix, j\u012bna (Pahbosa); iii, 40, c. ix, j\u012bna\u1e25; iv, 41, c. viii, j\u012bna\u1e25 and 43, c. xvii, j\u012bna\u1e25.\nThe characters are of a pure A\u015boka-type; the form of No. 2 (\u00f1o) is \u1e37 (a similar form occurs on a Kupinda-coin), and that of No. 5 (mi) is \u1e63', which also occurs on pl. iv, 12 (No. 5, infra, p. 416).\n\n1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7.\nKhar.: ra \u00f1a a ja mi tra sa\n\n\u00f1o\n\nNo. 2 of one specimen shows the variant \u1e37, \u1e63o, thus confirming the reading of the Br\u0101hm\u012b given above. No. 6 is \u1e63 tra.\n\nC. CAI., pl. iv, 9.\n\n1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7.\nBr.: r(.) ma hi m(.) ta .\n\nNo. 4 is \u1e37, hi; cf. t. iii, 38, c. xi, showing a later development. So far as I can judge from an examination of the coin itself there is nothing to support Cunningham's reading 'r\u0101janya.'\n\n1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7.\nKhar.: . \u00f1a ma hi mi tra sa\n\nNo. 4 is \u1e37, hi, being nearest to the Ku\u1e63\u0101na form given on t. i, 37, c. xi; No. 5, \u1e63', is also a later development, and both these might have been the result of the cursive writing then in vogue. A similar cursive form also occurs on the frieze from Hashtanagar (near Peshawar), now in the B.M., where the form for mi in the word di-(va)-sa-mi is \u1e63', with the side-strokes bent inwards instead of outwards.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 It may be added that this inscription begins with the latest date hitherto known in Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi inscriptions, viz. \u00d7 \u1e62 \u1e62 \u1e62 \u1e62 \u1e62 \u1e62 \u1e62, i.e. in the Samvat year 384.\nC.

The Br\u0101hm\u012b characters are like those of the \u015ao\u1e0d\u0101\u015ba inscriptions (cf. t. iii, c. i and ii). No. 2 is \u1e47a j\u00f1a, nearly the same as pl. iv, 6, No. 2; as to the decipherment of which see what has been said above (p. 413). The o-strokes of No. 3 almost form a semicircle instead of a horizontal stroke. The \u0101-strokes of No. 4 are similar to those on t. ii, 15, c. xv (in j\u00f1a), 27, c. iv (in n\u0101), and the letter must be read as l\u016b, not pta as Cunningham reads it; Ko-l\u016b-ta-sya is here probably the tribal name of the king. The i-strokes\nof No. 7 (ei) converge upwards in a flourish, as in later Br\u0101hm\u012b inscriptions. No. 8 (ra) exhibits an 'S'-shaped form common in the Girn\u0101r recension of the A\u015boka Edicts, e.g. iv, l. 8 (cf. t. ii, 34, c. ix, ru).\n\nC.CAI., pl. iv, 15.\n\nThis coin is remarkable as affording instances of some hitherto unrecorded Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b compound letters, the introduction of which is due to the fact that the inscriptions are in Sanskrit, more or less correct.\n\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|----|----|\n| Br.: | vr \u015bn(.) r(.) ja j\u00f1\u0101 ga na sya tra ta ra sya | Khar.: vri \u015bni ra \u2014 nna (ga) . . (t)ra . \u2014 \u2014 |\n\nAs regards the Br\u0101hm\u012b characters, No. 1, \u1e5b, with the r-vowel, occurs in the Jaina inscriptions of Mathur\u0101 (cf. t. iii, 34, c. iii). No. 5 is \u1e5b, j\u00f1\u0101 (cf. t. ii, 42, c. xix; iv, 42, c. i; and iii, 40, c. xiv, j\u00f1\u0101h), the right down-stroke of the na being joined on to the Tris\u016bla symbol. The reading of Nos. 9 and 10 (tra-ta)\u00b9 is quite different from that of Cunningham (blu-bha). Identical forms are to be found in the Pah\u014dsi inscriptions, and on pl. iv, 12, where the reading admits of no doubt. Moreover, the ra-stroke of the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b counterpart of No. 9 is quite clear. Further, if Cunningham's reading were correct, we ought to find four downward strokes in Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b Nos. 9 and 10, instead of the two which are clearly visible. My reading tra-ta-ra-sya is a royal title well known from early Indian coin inscriptions. The form and significance of the preceding word are discussed below (p. 420) in connection with my translation of the inscriptions.\n\nAs regards the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b characters, No. 1, \u1e5b, vri, with a crossing ra-stroke (cf. rte on a coin of Artemidoros,\n\n\u00b9 Mr. E. J. Rapson, whose attention I drew to this reading, had already, I am glad to say, come to the same conclusion.\nB.M. Cat., xiii, 2, and t. i, 39, c. i), shows the only possible way of signifying an r-vowel in Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b writing. The transverse stroke of No. 2, \u1e63\u1e47i, represents the n, and this is also the case in No. 5, \u1e63\u1e47, which I read \u1e63\u1e47a. Lastly, No. 12, \u1e63\u1e47a, is, as is obvious, a peculiar combination of a Khar. sa with a Br\u0101hm\u012b ya, a phenomenon, so far as I know, not found elsewhere in Indian palaeography.\n\nHaving thus given the epigraphical details of these Br\u0101hm\u012b-Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b inscriptions, it only remains to add a few words to make their decipherment as complete as possible.\n\nThe alphabets used in these inscriptions are both incomplete, in so far as neither of them has any means of denoting double-letters. The Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b, moreover, makes no distinction between long and short vowels. This deficiency in the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b alphabet may be supplied from the corresponding Br\u0101hm\u012b inscriptions; for, as we have seen, in spite of some divergencies in the forms of words, these bilateral inscriptions practically correspond to each other syllable for syllable. Long vowels marked in the Br\u0101hm\u012b inscriptions are therefore to be inserted in the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b transcriptions in such cases as the following: ma-h\u0101-de-vu-sa, r\u0101-ja-ra-\u00f1a (pl. iv, 5), ma-hi-mi-tra-sa (pl. iv, 9), bh\u0101-nu (or na) -mi-tra-sa (pl. iv, 12), etc., etc. Occasionally also the Br\u0101hm\u012b inscription teaches us the true reading of a Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b form. For instance, it shows that the stroke attached on the left at the foot of certain Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b characters indicates the vowel u, e.g. nu in bha-nu-mi-tra-sa (pl. iv, 12). Similarly the Br\u0101hm\u012b shows that the short stroke below the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b character in pl. iv, 1, No. 14, represents the anusvara (dum), and should be so read on the coins of Menander, e.g. B.M. Cat., pl. xi, 12.\n\nLastly, I would merely refer to the remarkable Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b inscription of pl. iv, 15, the compound characters of which would scarcely have been decipherable had it not been for the help of their Br\u0101hm\u012b equivalents.\n\nIn this comparison, the gain is undoubtedly most frequently from the more complete Br\u0101hm\u012b to the less complete Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b;\nbut in the case of the Brahmi coins which I hope to publish shortly, I have quoted an instance of the converse, in which I regard the interpretation of the two dots, sometimes seen in the Brahmi script, as indicating, as a stop and not as a rhyme, as receiving support from the Kharosthi equivalents.\n\nAs has been said above, neither Brahmi nor Kharosthi possesses the means of representing double-letters; but whenever doubt arises, whether a consonant should be read as single or double, we are entitled to determine the question in accordance with the phonetic law, by which a Sanskrit compound letter is represented in Prakrit either 1. by long vowel + single-consonant, or 2. by short vowel + double-consonant.\n\nAccording to these principles, I shall try to give here the final form of the inscriptions\u2014i.e. as they were spoken, with their long vowels and their double-consonants, not as they were represented epigraphically\u2014together with some notes on their grammar and translation. They are as follows:\n\nPl. ii, 1:\nBr.: \u0928\u093e\u092e\u093e \u0926\u0947\u0935\u092e\u093e\u0928\u093e \u0930\u093e\u091c\u094d\u091e\u0903 \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0930\u093e\u091c\u094d\u091e\u0903 \u0913\u093d \u0917\u094b\u0930\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0920\u0903\u0964\nKhar.: \u0928\u093e\u092e\u093e \u0926\u0947\u0935\u092e\u093e\u0928\u093e \u0930\u093e\u091c\u094d\u091e\u0903 \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0930\u093e\u091c\u094d\u091e\u0903 \u0913\u093d \u0917\u094b\u0930\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0920\u0903\u0964\n\nna < *n\u0101ma; r\u0101j\u00f1\u0101 < r\u0101j\u00f1\u0101. The final s of the Khar. r\u0101j\u00f1\u0101 may be short or long. If short, it is a genitive (< r\u0101j\u00f1\u0101\u1e25). If long, it is an instrumental form used as a genitive like the r\u0101j\u00f1\u0101t\u0101 of the inscription of pl. iv, 6: < r\u0101j\u00f1\u0101t\u0101.\n\nTrans.: \"Coin of His Highness King Dharaghosa of Odumbara.\"\n\nPl. iv, 5:\nBr.: \u092d\u0935 \u0917\u093e\u091a\u0924\u094b \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0924\u0947\u0930\u0938\u0903 \u0930\u091c\u094d\u091e\u0903 \u0930\u093e\u091c\u094d\u091e\u0903\u0964\nKhar.: \u092d\u0935\u0941\u0917\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0938\u093e \u0939\u093e\u0932\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0938\u093e \u0930\u093e\u091c\u094d\u091e\u0903\u0964\n\n* (cf. a Mathura coin mentioned above, see pl. iv, 6, C.CAL., pl. viii, 14, we find a Sanskrit instrumental side by side with a Prakrit genitive in a Brahmi inscription: r\u0101j\u00f1\u0101 r\u0101j\u00f1\u0101-d\u0101-t\u0101m.)\nFor r\u0101jar\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, see the form ra\u1e47\u1e0da above.

For this form Professor B\u00fchler proposed\n\n1 For this influence on the part of the labials in P\u0101li phonology, see E. M\u00fcller, P\u0101li Grammar, p. 6.\nsta, tsa, or tsa, in his notes on the word tadattaye, occurring in the Sh\u0101h\u0101ngarhi Edict, x, l. 21, and Mansehra, x, l. 9 (Epigraphia Indica, vol. ii, p. 459, notes 74 and 83). He read the same form as ds on coin-inscriptions of Eucratides (see Vienna Oriental Journal, vol. viii).\n\nPl. iv, 14. This is a purely Sanskrit inscription. The Khar. r\u0101j\u0101 (= r\u0101j\u0101), on the reverse, compared with the Br. r\u0101j\u0101, on the obverse, shows that the Skt. j\u0101na is written \u0101 in the Khar. alphabet (see also the inscrs. of pl. iv, 15, and v, 1 and 2, below). Neither alphabet at this period possessed a sign for the visarga.\n\nTrans.: \"(Coin of) King Viray\u0101na, the Kol\u016bta.\"\n\nPl. iv, 15:\n\nBr.: v\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47ir(\u0101)ja\u00f1\u0101ganasya tr(\u0101)tirasya.\nKhar.: v\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47ir\u0101jap\u0101 . . . tr\u0101 . . .\n\nIt seems to be clear that the first word is a compound containing eight syllables, the two first of which are cr\u0101ni (Khar. cr\u0101ni), evidently a name of some K\u1e63atriya tribe (cf. P.W., sub voce), and the three last of which are ganasya, \"race, family.\" The difficulty comes in with the central part of the compound, viz. r(\u0101)ja\u00f1\u0101 (Khar. r\u0101j\u0101\u00f1\u0101), and especially the fifth syllable (j\u0101 : \u0101), its a-vowel being clearly long.\n\nIt seems to me that there are three possible solutions of this difficulty.\n\n(1) A Skt. compound r\u0101ja + aj\u00f1\u0101 (order) would be represented by a Prakrit r\u0101jaj\u00f1\u0101 (possibly r\u0101jan\u0101 or r\u0101j\u00f1\u0101). Such a form might be represented by our Br. r(\u0101)ja\u00f1\u0101, with \u0101 as usual in these Sanskritic inscriptions, and Khar. r\u0101jan\u0101, with the lingual instead of the palatal nasal. If this be right, the whole is a bahur\u012bhi compound, the pure Skt. form of which would be cr\u0101ni-r\u0101j-aj\u00f1\u0101-ganasya, i.e., \"of a family whose name (?) is V\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47ir\u0101ja\" or \"whose royal name (?) is V\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47i.\"\n\n1 For the Prakrit representatives of aj\u00f1\u0101, cf. Kuhn, Beitr\u00e4ge, p. 36.\n(2) A Prakrit n\u0101na or n\u0101na might also be derived from a Skt. nya-\u1e47a and the word r\u0101j\u0101n\u0101, written here r\u0101j\u0101\u1e47\u0101 and r\u0101j\u0101\u1e47\u0101, would in this case correspond to a Skt. r\u0101janya, \"belonging to the K\u1e63atriya caste,\" and the whole be translated \"the (coin) of him whose family are the V\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47i k\u1e63atriyas (or royal race),\" or \"whose royal family are the V\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47is\" (vr\u1e63\u1e47i-r\u0101janya-ga\u1e47asya). The difficulty here lies in the final long a of the (r\u0101janya)-r\u0101j\u0101\u1e47\u0101. Is it possible that we have here an instance of that lengthening of compound bases seen in the Vedic dialect (cf. Whitney, Grammar, \u00a7\u00a7 247, 1255), and also occurring in the P\u0101li stage (cf. Kuhn's Beitr\u00e4ge, p. 30, and M\u00fcller's Grammar, p. 18)? Or has a plural form (r\u0101j\u0101\u1e47\u0101, 'the k\u1e63atriyas') been combined with the collective noun (ga\u1e47a, 'family') into a compound = \"the ga\u1e47a k\u1e63atriyas\"? (3) A less plausible suggestion is that vr\u1e63\u1e47ir\u0101j\u0101\u1e47\u0101 may be an instrumental used as a genitive. If this is so, we must suppose that the termination n\u0101 of forms like r\u0101n\u0101 has been irregularly added to the reconstructed stem r\u0101ja.\n\nIf we consider that there is a form r\u0101jar\u0101jassa side by side with r\u0101jar\u0101n\u0101 in the inscriptions of pl. iv, 5, noticed above, it is conceivable that -n\u0101, like -ssa, may have been added as a termination to the stem r\u0101ja. There remains, however, the syntactical difficulty of making our supposed instrumental agree with the genitives ga\u1e47asya and tr\u0101\u1e6d\u0101rusya.\n\n1 Cf. a\u1e47\u0101na- 'other' from a\u1e47a-, or pa\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101ya- 'cloud' from pa\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101ya-.\n2 In regard to the representation of the palatal \u0148a in Prakrit-Sanskrit coin-inscriptions, I may refer incidentally to the Yodheya coins figured in pl. vi, 2-4, of C. GAI. [cf. Rapson, Ind. Coins, pl. iii, 13], on some distinct specimens of which in the B.M. I read \"yo-\u0101ha-\u0101ha-\u0101ha-bh\u0101ma-\u0101ha-\u0101ha-\u0101ha\" (the yo and \u0101ha being identical with those in B\u0101hik\u0101, pl. iii, 31, columns i and xii); and also to those of pl. vi, 9-13 (cf. Rapson, pl. iii, 15), the name on which runs \"brahm\u0101 (once m\u0101ra)-nya-\u0101ha-\u0101ha-\u0101ha,\" the n\u0101ya being also written n\u0101.\n3 Somewhat similar is the addition of new terminations to old case-forms seen in such instances as ny\u0101-ti-yo-ga\u1e47asya, a-ti-yo-gen\u0101 (Kh\u0101l\u012b, A\u015boka Edicts, ii, l. 5, and xiii, l. 4). For such forms as va\u1e47\u1e47\u0101-ssa and r\u0101j\u0101-\u1e47a, see M\u00fcller, Grammar, p. 77.\nART. XVII.\u2014Notes on Indian Coins and Seals. Part II.\nBy E. J. Rapson, M.A., M.R.A.S.\n\nA Review of Mr. Bergny's \"Notes on some Br\u0101hm\u012b-Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b Inscriptions on Indian Coins.\"\n\nThanks to the investigations of Professor O. Franke\u00b9 and of Mr. A. Viktor Bergny the readings of practically all the known biliteral coin-legends in Br\u0101hm\u012b and Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b characters may now be regarded as finally settled. In this field of Indian numismatics, as in so many others, General Sir A. Cunningham was a pioneer, and it is, therefore, in no way surprising that many of his readings of these inscriptions as given in his Coins of Ancient India require correction. It is only within the last few years that the progress of the study of Indian epigraphy has made a scholarly treatment of this subject possible.\n\nMr. Bergny was good enough to submit his work to me in the Autumn of 1898, and I at once recognized that the extraordinary patience, with which he had subjected these coin-legends to a most minute scrutiny, had been rewarded by the discovery of some important facts which had escaped the notice of his fellow-investigators. It was, therefore, with great pleasure that I undertook, on his behalf, to edit the article which precedes this in the present number of the Journal. I have freely used the powers thus entrusted to me in shortening and condensing much that Mr. Bergny had written; but I hope that, in so doing, I have not allowed any fact or observation of importance to be lost. I thought it no part of my duty as editor to question any such statements of fact or expressions of\n\n\u00b9 ZDMG., Bd. 56.\nopinion, even in cases where my own studies had led me to a different conclusion. It is the object of the present review to call attention to these cases.\n\nSuch a difference of opinion may exist either in regard to the forms of the different alphabetic characters, or in regard to the complete word-forms and their construction\u2014it may be either epigraphic or grammatical.\n\nWith regard to the former class, Mr. Bergny is too much inclined to see new varieties where certainly they were not intended by the engravers. I cannot see, for instance, what is to be gained by noticing a form like \\( \\text{L} \\) (p. 414). The simple fact, in this case, is that the engraver, in the small space at his disposal\u2014less than one-tenth of an inch\u2014has made the usual \\( i \\)-curve rather angular; but surely this does not justify us in hailing the form as a new and unpublished variety!\n\nThe form \\( \\text{L} \\) \\( gho \\), given by Mr. Bergny (p. 410), cannot, I think, be supported. Such a form, if it could be proved, would be contrary to all analogy; but a further examination of the coin shows that the strange feature\u2014the curve to the left at the top of the central stroke\u2014is due not to the engraver but to a \u2018wave\u2019 in the metal. Other lines of this \u2018wave\u2019 running parallel to one another are to be seen on the same side of the coin\u2014one between \\( \u00f1o \\) and \\( dha \\), another above \\( dha \\), and another between \\( ra \\) and \\( gho \\). The letter in question is really of the ordinary form given by B\u00fchler, Taf. iii, and the vowel is represented quite regularly as in Col. I.\n\nWith regard to the form \\( \\text{L} \\) \\( j\u00f1a \\) or \\( j\u00f1\u0101 \\) (according to Mr. Bergny), I cannot agree that this is a correct representation of the character as it occurs on the coin\u2014or rather on the leaden cast of the coin from which the plaster cast, photographed in C.CAI., pl. iv, 6, was taken. If the horizontal stroke at the middle of the \\( ja \\)-portion of this compound exists at all\u2014and I very much doubt this\u2014it is certainly not such as to admit of the possibility of reading it as -\\( d \\).\nThe double-forms of sa \\( \\sigma \\) and \\( \\phi \\) to which Mr. Bergny calls attention (p. 411) are simply blunders of the die-engraver, who has miscalculated the space at his disposal, with the result that the final letters of the two portions of the inscription going round the margin of the coin, one from the left upwards and the other from the left downwards, have got jumbled together. What gain to knowledge can possibly come of any attempt to trace the development of these blunders through an intermediate hyphen-stage (p. 411), or, indeed, of any serious treatment of them whatever, is not apparent. They are mistakes pure and simple: and there is an end of the matter.\n\nMr. Bergny regards the character \\( \\sigma \\) sya as \"obviously a compound of Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b sa with Br\u0101hm\u012b ya\" (p. 417). I cannot accept this ingenious explanation in any way \"obvious.\" The representation of a Br\u0101hm\u012b ya in this compound is by no means evident. Even if we assume that Mr. Bergny's drawing is correct, and regard with him the two curves to right and left at the bottom as indicating a Br\u0101hm\u012b ya, we are still left without any explanation of the upper curve on the left. But, in reality, the existence of a curve on the right is altogether doubtful. A careful examination of the actual coin leads me rather to the conclusion that no such curve was intended. At any rate, it is a very inadequate hook on which to hang Mr. Bergny's theory of a mixture of the two alphabets\u2014\"a phenomenon,\" to use his own words, \"so far as I know, not found elsewhere in Indian palaeography.\"\n\nOn the whole question of the study of coins in its relation to epigraphy, a word of warning may not be out of place. In studying the forms of difficult alphabets, such as Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b or Sassanian Pahlavi for instance, as they appear on coins, there are two dangers which must be guarded against, and both of these arise from the fact that the forms so represented are, in most cases, necessarily very small. The die-engraver was working on so minute a scale that a very slight divergence in the tracing of a line\nor curve was apt to make a difference in the appearance of forms which were intended to be identical; while, on the other hand, it was not always easy to express the characteristic features which distinguish forms bearing a general resemblance to one another. Mr. Bergny seems not to have been able altogether to avoid the former danger: he is apt to see varieties where the coin-engraver intended none; and the whole history of the decipherment of the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b alphabet teems with instances showing how difficult, nay, how impossible, it was to escape the latter danger so long as coin-legends remained the chief sources of information. To the belief that \u015ba, da, and \u1e5b\u1e47 were represented by the same character, for instance\u2014and the first and third of these are really often quite undistinguishable on coins\u2014we are indebted for the comical forms tradatasa and the rest, which for so long a period enlivened works on Graeco-Indian numismatics. These errors were first corrected by B\u00fchler, who brought a knowledge of the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b alphabet derived from the A\u015boka inscriptions, in which any such confusion is quite impossible, to bear on the coins. The moral is, that for epigraphic purposes the large monuments should, where possible, be first studied. The light thus gained can then be focussed on to the minute forms of the coins with some prospect of a real gain to knowledge. In the decipherment of the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b alphabet the opposite procedure was inevitable since the first clue was supplied by the bilingual coins\u2014in Greek and Prakrit\u2014of the Graeco-Indian, \u015aaka, and Ku\u1e63\u0101na princes; but, at the stage to which the study has now reached, both epigraphically and linguistically, it is no longer necessary to court the perils which attended the steps of the first explorers.\n\nSomething still remains to be said about the readings or constructions of verbal forms proposed by Mr. Bergny. The most daring of these is the statement (p. 418, note 1; cf. p. 413) that \"on a Mathur\u0101 coin . . . . C. OAI,\"\n\n1 WZKM., viii.\npl. viii, 14, we find a Sanskrit instrumental side by side with a Prakrit genitive in a Br\u0101hm\u012b inscription: \"r\u0101-j\u00f1\u0101 r\u0101-ma-da-ta-na.\" Such a construction is, of course, absolutely unheard of; and no instance of its occurrence can be accepted without the fullest confirmation. By what evidence is it supported in the present case? Fortunately, there is no lack of materials, for the coins of R\u0101madatta are the commonest of the series of the Hindu Princes of Mathur\u0101. From an examination of the twenty specimens in the British Museum, it is certain that the usual inscription is quite distinctly what we should expect it to be\u2014R\u0101j\u00f1o R\u0101madattasa.\n\nIs there any sufficient reason to doubt, then, that the intention of the engraver was always to produce this reading? On what facts does Mr. Bergny's case rest? Simply, it appears, on this: The difference between j\u00f1\u0101 and j\u00f1\u0101 consists merely in the fact that the former has a horizontal stroke on the left at the middle of the ja-portion of the compound. This ja-portion itself is, in height, only about three-sixteenths of an inch, and the added stroke which distinguishes j\u00f1\u0101 from j\u00f1\u0101 is probably never more than one-sixteenth of an inch in length and is often very much shorter\u2014quite infinitesimal in fact. Indeed, whether it can be said to exist at all is, in some cases, a mere question of opinion and eyesight. Mr. Bergny has found an instance\u2014I have not been able to identify the particular specimen to which he refers\u2014in which he decides that it does not exist, and, therefore, he thinks it right to record the reading as j\u00f1\u0101 and not j\u00f1\u0101. On so unsubstantial a basis does his theory of the unnatural alliance of an instrumental and a genitive rest! In all seriousness, it must be pointed out that it is quite possible to satisfy scholarship and to defeat its object\u2014the discovery of truth\u2014by neglecting broad principles and fixing the attention on infinitesimal details, by assigning to accidents the importance which belongs to essentials.\n\nIn two other instances Mr. Bergny suggests the possibility of this construction, but neither of them affords any satisfactory evidence. He supposes that the word which he\nreads as *vijayata* on the coin of the Audumbara Rudra-\nvarman, C.CAI., pl. iv, 6, may be an instrumental agreeing\nwith the rest of the inscription\u2014*R\u0101\u1e47a*, etc.\u2014in the genitive\n(p. 419). Certainly, he does himself add that, since the\nquantity of the final vowel is doubtful, the word may very\nwell represent *vijayata\u1e25*, the ordinary Sanskrit genitive of the\npresent participle. Now, if these were the two alternatives,\nwho would hesitate to choose the latter as being the more\nprobable? But since the inscription is in Prakrit, a better\nexplanation is that a final -sa has been omitted. The regular\nPrakrit form of the participle, *vijayatasa*, would be much\nmore in accordance with the usual practice, and the con-\njecture that the final syllable has been omitted is supported\nby the occurrence in the corresponding Br\u0101hm\u012b inscription\nof an unquestionably abbreviated form *vijaya*.\n\nThe last instance occurs in the third explanation which\nMr. Bergny regards as possible for the very difficult form\n*r\u0101jaj\u00f1\u0101* (p. 421). He himself regards it as the least plausible\nof his suggested solutions of this puzzle, and confesses that,\napart from the question of the construction of this word\nwith a genitive, it is not easy to explain the form as an\ninstrumental. This third explanation is altogether too far-\nfetched to be at all probable; and it cannot be said that\neither of the other suggestions is quite convincing. It may\nbe that the true solution of this difficulty still remains to\nbe found. In the meantime, Mr. Bergny deserves our thanks\nfor his very ingenious attempts, and for the light which his\nresearches have thrown on other points of interest in these\nremarkable inscriptions.\n\nIt will be seen, then, that there is not one shred of real\nevidence for the occurrence, in the Prakrit of the coins, of\nthe construction of an instrumental in apposition to a genitive.\nIt is, of course, well known that, in many varieties of Prakrit,\nthe same form does double duty for both dative and genitive,\nand that, in some instances, the dative-form is the one which\nhas survived\u2014e.g. *r\u0101jine Pani\u1e6dalevasa* on the coins of Panta-\nleon\u00b9\u2014but there is no evidence to warrant us in believing\n\n\u00b9 B.M. Cat., p. 9.\nthat the instrumental was ever so used. It remains to be proved that case-construction in Prakrit ever resolved itself into the sort of \"go as you please\" which this would necessitate.\n\nMr. Bergny's reading K\u014dl\u016btasya (p. 415) on the coin published in C.CAL., pl. iv, 14, is undoubtedly correct. General Sir A. Cunningham's reading and the one proposed by me (J.R.A.S., 1900, p. 125) alike err in failing to recognize that the consonant of the second ak\u1e63ara is l. This is a most important correction, for it adds one more to the list of Indian states of Ancient India who are known to us from their coinage.\n\nKol\u016bta (Kaul\u016bta) is, of course, \"the king of the Kul\u016btas,\" a tribe known to us from a number of passages in Sanskrit literature and from an inscription. These I have collected and compared in a subsequent article.\n\nIn this review of Mr. Bergny's work I have only\u2014except in this last instance, in which I gladly acknowledge his correction of an error on my part\u2014drawn attention to those points on which I am unable to agree with him; and, so far as I know, I have allowed none of these points to escape. The far more numerous cases in which I am in complete agreement with him I have tacitly passed over. I can only hope that this one-sided treatment will not tend to obscure my very real appreciation of the great service he has done to Indian numismatics, in putting on record a scientifically accurate account of these Br\u0101hm\u012b-Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b coin-legends.\n\n1 Professor O. Franke, in a letter to me dated March 12, 1900, makes the same correction.\n\n2 On ancient coins gana often occurs where we should expect yuddhi in these forms; e.g. Odanapari (for Audanapari) = \"the king of the Ud\u0101naparai,\" Tumati (for Tumati), Mr. Bergny's reading on the coin of Rudravarma (p. 412), is probably another such form = \"the king of the Vimakas\"; but a people of this name seems not to be known from any other source. For these forms generally, see J.R.A.S., 1900, p. 99. Mr. Bergny rightly reads Yaudhya on the coins to which he refers (p. 421, note 2). The form Yaudhya, however, also occurs on coins, e.g. C.CAL., vi, 6-8, and in the Allahabad inscription (cf. Fleet, CII., iii, pl. i, line 22).\nART. XVIII.\u2014The Buddhist Monastery at Sohn\u0101g in the Gorakhpur District. By Vincent A. Smith, I.C.S., M.R.A.S. With two plans and a plate.\n\nIn January last, having heard that important ruins at a place called Sohn\u0101g, in the eastern part of the Gorakhpur District, where I was then stationed as Commissioner, were being excavated for bricks by a railway contractor, I caused the work to be suspended until inquiries should be made, and on the 14th January visited the ruins. The building disclosed by the excavations is of such a remarkable character, unique indeed in its massive dimensions, so far as my knowledge extends, that it is desirable to place on record an accurate description of it.\n\nSohn\u0101g (\u0938\u094b\u0939\u0928\u093e\u0917) is a tiny hamlet situated in Tappa M\u0101il (\u092e\u093e\u0907\u0932), Pargana Salempur, Taluq Deori\u0101, of the Gorakhpur District, distant about three miles south-west from Salempur and about fifty miles south-east from Gorakhpur. The place is now readily accessible by rail, being about two and a half miles in a southerly direction from the Salempur station of the Bhatn\u012b and Benares branch of the Bengal and North-Western Railway, and about half a mile west of the railway.\n\nAs soon as possible after my visit to Sohn\u0101g I caused the ruins to be surveyed by Saiyid Shuj\u0101'at 'Al\u012b, overseer of the Public Works Department.\n\nThe map A gives a general plan of the ruins, the plan B gives details of the principal building. The remains are situated on the western bank of a considerable pond, or small lake, about 1,250 feet in length from north to south, and 600 or 700 feet broad from east to west. The main building is a little more than 200 feet to the west of the lake, and was approached on the east by a flight of brick steps rising from the water.\nThe building is 487 feet long from north to south, and 112 feet wide. It comprised four quadrangles, surrounded by cells. The exterior circuit contains 64 cells, 28 on each of the long sides and four at each end. Twenty-four cells in the divisions between the quadrangles bring up the number of cells to 88.\n\nThe walls are of extraordinary mass and thickness. Those of the outer perimeter are seven and a half feet thick. The walls separating the cells of the most southern from those of the northern are no less than eight and a quarter feet thick. The inner walls are six feet in thickness.\n\nThe bricks used are of huge bricks set in mud. They are $1' \\times 4\\frac{3}{4}' \\times 9'' \\times 2\\frac{3}{4}''$ and $9\\frac{3}{4}' \\times 2\\frac{3}{4}'$. Some other sizes were also used, and one brick nineteen inches long. The foundations are of unusual depth. Those of the walls six feet in thickness are carried down sixteen feet, and those of the thicker walls twenty feet from the surface of the mound. The cells as they now exist have no entrances. Evidently the whole superstructure has fallen in, and we now see only the massive foundations. The exceptional solidity of the foundations indicates that the superstructure must have been of considerable height and weight, but no materials exist from which any inference can be drawn as to the character of the elevation.\n\nA quantity of cowrie shells was found in the central cell on the eastern side of courtyard No. II. Votive tablets, of the kind commonly called \"Buddhist seals,\" have been found in considerable numbers in several of the cells. I understand that many of these were given to Dr. Hoey, my predecessor as Commissioner of Gorakhpur, who has taken them to Europe. I have obtained seven specimens.\n\nNo. I is an irregular ball of grey clay, pierced, about an inch in diameter, stamped on one side with the inscription \u015ar\u012b Bhagava, \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092d\u0917\u0935, in mediaeval letters of about the tenth century.\n\nNo. II is a circular disk of red clay, convex on the blank side, and stamped on the obverse in a circular incuse with\na legend of six lines in minute characters. The legend seems to be the so-called \"Buddhist creed,\" beginning Ye dharmma hetu prabhava, which is really the mantra of the Mahayana sect. This object is \"95\" in diameter.\n\nNo. III is a similar object in grey clay, slightly larger, being 1'1\" in diameter. The legend is the same as on No. II.\n\nNos. IV and V are exactly alike, and seem to be struck from a single die. Each is an oval tablet of reddish clay 3\u00bd\" long, pointed at the top, with a deep oval incuse, containing the figure of a goddess, probably Sri or Laksmi, the goddess of good fortune, facing front, seated on a lotus flower, with her left leg tucked up and right leg hanging down. A miniature stupa, with tall pointed hti in three stages, is above each shoulder, and under the stupa over the left shoulder there is a six-petalled flower. The inscription is on both sides of the goddess and below her. It is the \"Buddhist creed.\"\n\nNos. VI and VII resemble Nos. IV and V in shape, but are slightly smaller, being about 3\u00bc\" in length. A seated Buddha in the bhumisparsha attitude, with his right hand pointing to the ground, is substituted for the goddess. The legend is stamped at the sides of and below the image and is the \"Buddhist creed.\" The stupas at the shoulders are similar to those on Nos. IV and V, but the six-petalled flower is wanting.\n\nThe characters in all the tablets Nos. II to VII are certainly not very ancient. They seem to me to date from about the sixth or seventh century A.D. The alphabet of the Buddha tablets is perhaps rather older than that of the goddess tablets.\n\nThe only recognizable coin which was brought to me was a common coin of a king of Jaunpur in the fifteenth century, but much worn ancient copper coins are sometimes found.\n\nNos. I, V, and VII accompany this paper, and are at the disposal of the Society. See Plate. The other specimens have been deposited in the Lucknow Provincial Museum.\nNo inscription other than the legends on the tablets has yet been discovered.\n\nThe Sohn\u0101g tablets closely resemble in general character those found at Pakna-Bih\u0101r in the Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d District, which have been described and illustrated by Cunningham.\u00b9 As at Pakna-Bih\u0101r, the Sohn\u0101g tablets are frequently found enclosed in balls of clay.\n\nThe plans show the extent to which the main building has been excavated. The largest quadrangle, that to the north, has not yet been touched. The object of the excavator being to obtain bricks for railway ballast, the rubbish which fills the interior of the cells has rarely been disturbed, and in consequence many small objects, no doubt, remain to be discovered. The six small mounds to the west have not been disturbed. They are probably st\u016bpas.\n\nThe small mound marked \"sam\u0101dhi\" near the flight of steps was opened by me and proved to be the tomb of a fak\u012br, who had been buried, as usual, in a sitting position. I replaced and covered up his bones, which were accompanied by the clay beads of his rosary.\n\nIt is, I think, impossible to doubt that the main building is a monastery. The tablets show that it was a monastery of Buddhists of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na sect. The style of the masonry proves that the building is much more ancient than the objects found in it which have been above described. At the Commissioner's house in Gorakhpur there is a terracotta seated Buddha about a foot and a half high, which has a much more archaic appearance than the seals. It came from Sohn\u0101g, as also did a broken stone stool which is kept with it. Such stone stools, as is well known, are commonly found in the ruins of Buddhist monasteries.\u00b2\n\nAlthough the remarkable remains at Sohn\u0101g are for the first time rendered intelligible by the recent excavations and the description in this paper, they have been more or less known for many years.\n\n\u00b9 \"Archaeological Survey Reports,\" vol. iii, pp. 35\u201338, pl. xii.\n\u00b2 I gave Professor Rhys Davids a fragment of a large black stone votive tablet, or \"seal,\" from Sohn\u0101g, inscribed in characters of about the fifth century. The inscription had contained a royal genealogy.\nBuchanan-Hamilton heard of them, and sent a native draughtsman to visit them, who made drawings of some of the mediaeval Hindu statues in the shrines on the surface of the mound.\n\nThe ruins were again and more fully described by Mr. William Crooke, I.C.S., who served for a considerable time in the Gorakhpur District about twenty-five years ago. When Mr. Crooke visited Sohn\u0101g no excavations had been made, and it was \"impossible to say accurately what buildings it contained.\" He estimated the height of the most elevated part of the mound at 50 feet, and conjectured that it was probably a st\u016bpa, \"the lower portion (which shows traces of a quadrangular building) being a Buddhist monastery and apartments for ascetics.\" I agree with Mr. Crooke that a st\u016bpa probably existed on the highest part of the mound, now crowned by the temple of Gauri\u1e63ankar.\n\nMr. Crooke was in error in supposing the images in the modern temples on the ruins to be Buddhistic. They are ordinary Brahmanical statues of \u015aiva and P\u0101rvat\u012b (Gauri\u1e63ankar), Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, etc.\n\nThe hero Para\u015bu R\u0101ma is specially venerated at Sohn\u0101g, and a fair in his honour is held on the 3rd of the bright half of the month Bais\u0101kh (April\u2013May) in the open space to the north of the monastery, as shown in the map. Probably this fair is a survival of some Buddhist holiday.\n\nMr. Crooke says that the ancient name of Sohn\u0101g was N\u0101gpur. According to Buchanan-Hamilton, \"the original name of the place was Nagar.\"\n\nThe Brahmanical legends about the place, which are cited by Mr. Crooke and the earlier writer, are not worth repeating.\n\nSohn\u0101g, as Mr. Crooke observed, is one of a series of ancient sites extending from the crossing of the Gh\u0101gr\u0101 river (also called Deoh\u0101) along the northern road through Kasi\u0101 to Nep\u0101l. The present crossing-place is at Bh\u0101galpur.\n\n---\n\n1 \"Eastern India,\" vol. ii, p. 361, pl. iv. (London, 1838.)\n2 Gazetteer of the North-Western Provinces, vol. vi, pp. 544\u2013546. (Allahabad, 1881.)\non the Gorakhpur side, and Turtip\u0101r on the Baliya, or southern, side of the river. A huge d\u012bk or mound of ruins called Khairigarh is close to Turtip\u0101r. A great railway bridge is now being constructed between Bh\u0101galpur and Turtip\u0101r.\n\nA pillar at Bh\u0101galpur is inscribed with a record of twenty-one lines in mediaeval characters, supposed to date from the tenth century. This inscription does not seem to have been ever properly edited.\u00b9\n\nAn old ferry used also to exist at M\u0101il, about four miles north of Bh\u0101galpur. The two ferries may be regarded as one. Two roads go northwards from the river bank. One, running almost due north, passes the ancient Jain site of Kah\u0101\u016bn, four miles beyond M\u0101il.\u00b2 About two and a half miles further north there is a mound of ruins at Chero. Seven miles further north the traveller reaches the very extensive remains of Khukhun\u016b (Khukhundo), which are almost, if not quite, conterminous with ruins at Nonkh\u0101r, three miles to the north-east.\u00b3 From Nonkh\u0101r to the celebrated ruins at Bisanpur, near Kasi\u0101, so long erroneously reputed to be the site of Kus\u0101nagara,\u2074 the distance due north is about twenty-two miles. I do not know whether ancient remains exist in this interval or not. From\n\n\u00b9 An eye-copy of five lines of the inscription is given in \"Eastern India,\" vol. ii, pl. v, p. 365. Cunningham's assistant, Mr. Garrick, has published photographs of the pillar and the inscription (\"Reports,\" vol. xvi, pls. xxx and xxxi), from which the record might be edited. But it is greatly mutilated. The pillar is close to the bank of the river.\n\n\u00b2 An eye-copy of the inscription on the Kah\u0101\u016bn pillar was published in \"Eastern India,\" vol. ii, pl. v, where the name of the village Kah\u0101\u016bn appears under the disguise of Kangho. The document was correctly edited and translated by Dr. Fleet (\"Gupta Inscriptions\"). It records the dedication of the five Jain images carved on the pillar by one Madra, at K\u0101kubha\u1e45grama (Kah\u0101\u016bn), in the reign of Sh\u0101ntanu, thirty years (141) of the Gupta era, corresponding to A.D. 456. A good photograph of the pillar by Mr. Garrick will be found in pl. xxix of vol. xvi of the \"Reports.\"\n\n\u00b3 Nonkh\u0101r is now a railway station on the Bengal and North-Western Railway. Cunningham published a slight description of the Khukhun\u016b ruins in vol. i of the \"Reports,\" pp. 86-91, pl. xviii. He calls the place Khukhundo, and says that the original name was Ki\u1e63kindapura. I have always heard the name pronounced without the \u0101. I regret that I have not visited the ruins.\n\n\u2074 These remains are fully described in my monograph entitled \"The Remains near Kasi\u0101\" (Allahabad, 1896).\nBis\u0101npur and Kasi\u0101 a Buddhist pilgrim would march northeast, cross the river Gandak, and so arrive at Lauriya, and there meet the Nep\u0101l road from P\u0101\u1e6daliputra (Patna) and Vais\u0101li (Bas\u0101r). The second road from the Bh\u0101gpalpur or M\u0101il ferry runs in a north-easterly direction towards S\u0101ran, and passes Sohn\u0101g, which is about four miles due east from Kah\u0101on. Many other ancient mounds exist in the neighbourhood. They are being freely dug up for railway ballast.\n\nSurprise may probably be felt because I have not stopped the excavations at Sohn\u0101g. When I heard of them in January, 1900, the excavations had already continued for a year, and about half the building, or more, had been destroyed. The right of excavating the bricks had been sold by the owners of the village for a trifling sum, Rs. 300, or \u00a320, I believe, to the contractor. Nobody had any notion that such an enormous mass of bricks would be proved to exist, and the contractor has consequently made a small fortune.\n\nThe excavation having gone so far, I thought it useless to stop it. Moreover, the mound, while unexplored, was unintelligible. The excavations have revealed the plan of the building, and may at any moment yield inscriptions or other objects of great interest. The preservation of the mere bricks of the foundation is of slight importance. Once the plan has been accurately described and recorded it makes little matter whether the bricks are still in the foundations or not. The superstructure disappeared long ago. I have given the contractor stringent orders to send in all objects discovered. He gave, as already noted, a large number to Dr. Hoey, and the few since found have been willingly given to me. After full consideration of the question I did not feel justified in stopping the excavations.\n\n---\n\n1 \"Reports,\" vol. i, pp. 69-73, pl. xxiv; vol. xvi, pp. 104-108, pl. xxviii; vol. xxii, pp. 42-48.\nART.

Nazar Bay Turkestan\u012b MS.\n\nTwo titles seem to be used for these MSS., viz. Tuzuk-i-b\u0101bari and B\u0101barn\u0101ma. A third name\u2014B\u0101bariyah, \u0628\u0627\u0628\u0631\u06cc\u0647\u2014 is given to the work in the last of the St. Petersburg fragments (cf. No. XII). B\u0101bar uses \u0648\u0642\u0627\u06cc\u0639 as a common noun when speaking of his writings. The title Waq\u0101yat-i-b\u0101bari, when\nused exactly, seems to apply to the Persian translation only. The colophon of the St. Petersburg Asiatic Museum MSS. supplies a new name, *Wagdyi-n\u0101ma-i-p\u0101dah\u0101hi*.\n\nFor help in preparing these notes, I have to thank Mr. A. G. Ellis for his invaluable guidance amongst the catalogues and books used in the British Museum; Mr. C. Salemann (director of the St. Petersburg Asiatic Museum, and compiler with Baron v. Rosen of the Oriental MSS. Catalogue of the St. Petersburg University Library, 1888), for most useful and exquisitely framed notes on the Russian Turki texts; Professor Nicolas F\u00e9odorovitch Katanoff, of the Kazan University, for much useful information and the trouble taken in collecting it; Mr. N. Schilder, director of the St. Petersburg Public Library; Miss Fanny Toolman Smith, together with other friendly help, for a translation of 'Ilminski's preface; Mr. William Irvine; Professor E. Denison-Ross; and Mr. W. Hall Griffin and Mr. E. de Nezanda-Trepka, who both helped me with Ilminski's preface. For the loan of MSS. I have to thank the Bibliotheca Lindesiana, the India Office, and the Asiatic Society of Bengal, and I am indebted to Professor Robert K. Douglas for enabling me to use these MSS. under his charge at the British Museum. Those who have worked much at the British Museum realize from time to time that one is made free of its vast resources and that it is truly our own national and individual possession. For this reason it does not always occur to us to express the gratitude we really feel, for its helpfulness and generous collaboration.\n\nI. Emperor Babar's autograph MS.\n\nCertain divergencies in the substance of the Turki texts have suggested to me that Babar put forth two versions of his autobiography, a first which was based on a diary and a second which was in parts revised and polished.\nThe St. Petersburg MSS. appear to me to have descended from the first edition, the Elphinstone MS. and its allies from the second. In speaking of the Russian Foreign Office MS. (No. XII) I have named some points which suggested this as possible. Their worth can only be judged by expert examination.\n\nWhether any MS. that may be ranked as autograph still survives, I am not able to say. A little hope encircles some of the Russian set, and there are special features of the Elphinstone which forbid its exclusion until further examination of it has been made. Unfortunately I have not been able to find this most valuable copy.\n\nThe date of composition of even the earlier and elaborated portion of the *T\u0101zuk-i-b\u0101bar\u012b* or *B\u0101bar-n\u0101ma* is fixed by internal evidence as being late in the author's reign. This is pointed out by Mr. Erskine; M. Pavet de Courteille supports it by citation of evidence, and to this evidence more might be added. The whole of the work (which, however, seems to be based upon a diary) appears to have been written in Hind\u016bst\u0101n, where perhaps it filled the tedious leisure of hot seasons.\n\nA portion of the *B\u0101bar-n\u0101ma* and a transcript of that portion (cf. No. II) existed prior to March 5th, 1529, since the transcript was despatched on this day to Samarqand. That B\u0101bar was working much later we gather from Gulbadan Begam. She went to Hind\u016bst\u0101n with M\u0101ham Begam, who reached Agra on June 27th, 1529. Several months later she accompanied B\u0101bar and M\u0101ham to Dh\u016blpur and S\u012bkri. In her narrative of incidents of this excursion she names a building in S\u012bkri where her \"royal father used to sit and write his book,\" and these words, with their context, allow the inference that he was doing so at the time of her visit, i.e. later than the \"Gual\u0101r passage\" (Mems., 425). The manuscript fragments which are attached to No. XII, reproduced by Ilminski and made familiar by Pavet de Courteille, carry down the narrative\n\n---\n\n1 Memoirs of B\u0101bar, Leyden and Erskine, p. 405.\nwhich is, in them, attributed to B\u0101bar, to within a few weeks at most of his death on December 26th, 1530.\n\nII. Khw\u0101ja Kil\u0101n's MS.\n\nThis is the transcript already named as despatched on March 5th, 1529, to Samarqand. Of its survival I have no information. It was sent to Khw\u0101ja Kil\u0101n (a Samarqand khw\u0101ja and not B\u0101bar's intimate friend of the same title), who, having been on a visit at B\u0101bar's Court in Agra, took leave to return home on February 1st, 1529. He had preferred a request for a copy of B\u0101bar's book, and under date March 7th, 1529, the Emperor notes its dispatch to him.\n\nOf this MS., then, it is known that it was not carried beyond March, 1529. Also that it did not contain Hum\u0101yi\u016bn's notes of 1553\u20134 (961 H. Cf. No. III). In this last particular it agrees with St. Petersburg No. XII.\n\nA minute point as to the date of this transcript is seen by considering the following parallel passages from the Persian and English versions. For the sake of comparison the Turki and French are added.\n\nI.O., Pers., No. 29 and No. 3,405 (old numbering):\n\n\u062e\u0648\u0627\u062c\u06c1 \u06a9\u0644\u0627\u0646 \u0646\u0628\u06cc\u0631\u06c1 \u06cc\u06a9\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u0645\u0646 \u0631\u0642\u0627\u0628\u06cc \u06a9\u06d2 \u0646\u0648\u0634\u062a\u0647 \u0634\u0648\u062f \u0645\u06cc\u0637\u0644\u06cc\u0628\u06cc\u062f\n\n\u0627\u0633\u062a\u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u06a9\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0628\u0648\u062f\u0645 \u0627\u0632 \u062f\u0633\u062a\u06cc \u0634\u06c1\u0631\u06a9 \u0641\u0631\u0633\u062a\u0627\u062f\u0647 \u0634\u062f\n\nMemoirs, p. 405:\n\n\"Khw\u0101ja Kil\u0101n, Khw\u0101ja Yahia's grandson, had asked for a copy of the Memoirs\" [\u0631\u062a\u0627\u0628\u06cc] memoirs] \"which I had written.

Istik\u1e6d\u0101b kund\u016bda budam may refer only to the interval between the request and its fulfilment by despatch of the copy, i.e. during the visit of Khw\u0101ja Kil\u0101n to Agra or even after his departure. If the copy had existed before the Khw\u0101ja left Agra, it would have been natural for him to receive it before he left.\n\nIn rendering nav\u012bsh\u1e6da sharad by \"had written\" is not the subjective force of sharad wasted? Cannot nav\u012bsh\u1e6da sharad contain the idea of \"whatever might have been written,\" i.e. incomplete as it was, and thus indicate a time less remote and definite than does \"had written\"? Mit\u0101thid could also yield a fuller notion than \"had written,\" e.g. \"kept asking,\" or \"used to ask,\" either of which forms would modify the sense as to time of transcription.\n\nIII. (Emperor Hum\u0101y\u016bn's Transcript.)\n\nSo far as I have been able to ascertain, the sole evidence of the existence of this MS. is afforded by a marginal note of the Emperor Hum\u0101y\u016bn upon a copy of the Tuzuk-i-b\u0101bari, and by Mr. Erskine's translation of that note. The words of the translation (Mems., 303) are as follows:\u2014\n\n\"Now that I am forty-six, I, Mu\u1e25ammad Hum\u0101y\u016bn, am transcribing a copy of these Memoirs from the copy in his late Majesty's own hand-writing.\"\n\nSome doubt having arisen in my mind about this passage, I have not ventured to include Hum\u0101y\u016bn's transcript amongst MSS. of which the existence is established. The matter is of great interest, for the words just quoted and their context are valuable both historically and critically. They are a part of one of two notes made by Hum\u0101y\u016bn\nand which Mr. Erskine says occur in the Elphinstone Turki text, i.e. that with which he collated his finished work. They do not appear in all the Turki texts. (This point is taken up in each section of these notes.) One only appears in any of the considerable number\\(^1\\) of MSS. of the Persian translation in which I have looked for them.\n\nOf Hum\u0101y\u016bn's two notes, the second concerns a fruit\u2014the amratphul (Mems., 329, n.). Of this it is sufficient to say here that it is not found in any MS.\u2014Turki or Persian\u2014to which I have had access. The Elphinstone, I regretfully repeat, has eluded my search.\n\nThe first note (Mems., 302\u20133) is that of which part has been quoted. It is necessary to consider it somewhat in detail. I must then leave it to scholars to judge whether it justifies the admission of \"Hum\u0101y\u016bn's Transcript\" amongst facts.\n\nI cannot quote the note in Turki because I have not seen it in that tongue.\\(^2\\) It is given below in full from Persian and English versions; the former is strictly the source of the latter, since it is an extract from B.M.

As my\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Mr. Erskine worked from two Persian MSS., i.e. B.M. Add. 26,200 and B.M. Add. 26,201 (Mr. Metcalfe's), the latter being, he says, \"defective and incorrect.\" In these more facile days \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u062d\u0636\u0631\u062a was easily able to consult a second dozen.\n\n\\(^2\\) Dr. Leyden's manuscript translation from the Turki gives no help, because it ends before the notes of Hum\u0101y\u016bn are reached.\nhonoured father mentions in these commentaries the time of his first using the razor, in humble emulation of him I have commemorated the same circumstance regarding myself. I was then eighteen years of age. Now that I am forty-six, I, Muhammad Hum\u0101y\u016bn, am transcribing a copy of these Memoirs from the copy in his late Majesty's own hand-writing.)\n\nHaving had occasion, on another ground, to note the occurrence of this passage in the Turk\u012b and Persian versions of the autobiography of B\u0101bar, I looked for it in all available MSS. I found it in none of the Turki, but in at least fourteen of the Persian. Reiterated perusal awakened some deferential uncertainty as to Mr. Erskine's reading. It was a most regretful doubt, since this rendering not only provides a critical test of some points in the history of the MSS., but is full of human interest. Everyone would prefer to leave the king-in-exile to his pious task, untroubled by criticism. Everyone, too, who has enjoyed Mr. Erskine's writings, must desire to find him always in the right.\n\nAt this point occurred one of those fortuitous dovetailings which now and then fit into one's work the exact thing it needs. Mr. Beveridge, writing from India about a remarkable Persian W\u0101qi\u02bfat-i-b\u0101bar\u012b which he had seen in Alwar, observed that it, as well as the lithograph of M\u012brz\u0101 Muh. Shir\u0101z\u012b, contains a copyist's note on the \"shaving passage\" (i.e. Hum\u0101y\u016bn's note; Mem., 302-3), to the effect that this passage was copied from Hum\u0101y\u016bn's own handwriting.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 The Shir\u0101z\u012b passage (171, foot), confused and defective in several places, runs thus:\n\n\u062f\u0631 \u0647\u0645\u06cc\u0646 \u0645\u0646\u0632\u0644 \u0647\u0645\u06cc\u0634\u0647 \u0631\u0648\u0632 \u0647\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u0648\u0646 \u062f\u0631 \u0631\u0648\u06cc \u062e\u0648\u062f \u0627\u0633\u062a \u0648 \u0645\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0631\u06cc\n\u0631\u0633\u0627\u062f \u062c\u0648\u0646 \u062d\u0636\u0631\u062a \u0645\u062e\u062f\u0648\u0645\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u062a \u0648 \u0631\u0633\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0646 \u062f\u0631 \u0622\u0646 \u0648\u0642\u0627\u06cc\u0639 \u0630\u06a9\u0631 \u06a9\u0631\u062f\n\u0628\u0648\u062f\u0646\u062f [omission] \u062f\u0631 \u0622\u0646 \u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u0647\u0634\u062a\u0645 \u0633\u0627\u0644\u0647 \u0628\u0648\u062f \u0633\u0646 (\u0628\u0648\u062f\u0645) \u062f\u0631\n\u0633 \u0686\u0647\u0644 \u0648 \u0634\u0634 \u0633\u0627\u0644 \u0628\u0648\u062f \u0628\u0627\u0634 \u0645\u062e\u062f\u0648\u0645\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u0646\u0642\u0644 \u062e\u0637 \u0645\u0628\u0627\u0631\u06a9\n\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0646\u062a\u0631 \u0645\u0646\u0642\u0644 \u0634\u062f\nvariants elsewhere for him to comment upon the discovery and upon the variation of the texts.\n\nIf Mr. Erskine's reading be correct and indisputably based on the Turki, the copyists of the Persian MSS. have gone wrong, since they vary the note as their copies descend from the original. (Cf. Table, infra.) The reading adopted by the later scribes is of course of little weight, since this is due to the initiative of the earlier ones and in particular and chief of the earliest.\n\nThe later copyists indicate for their work three degrees of descent from the source, viz.:\n\n(a) Copied from a copy of a copy of the handwriting.\n\nGoing back a step, the passage stands:\n\n(b) Copied from a copy of the handwriting.\n\nEarlier than this must have been a form of which I have no examples, viz.:\n\n(c) Copied from the handwriting.\n\nPerhaps this (c) existed only in the Turki texts.\n\nIt seems that the first scribe, i.e. he who wrote as in example (c), either did not read what Hum\u0101y\u016bn wrote in the way Mr. Erskine has read and translated, or that he did not set down his reading so clearly as to prevent his successor from falling into error and adding a 'naql.'\n\nBoth the Persian texts used by Mr. Erskine are worded like example (a), which allows the inference of three descents from the \"blessed handwriting.\" How would Mr. Erskine have worded his translation if example (b) had been before him?\n\nIf the whole of the note under discussion be attributed, as Mr. Erskine has attributed it, to one hand\u2014Hum\u0101y\u016bn's,\nSeen by the light of this remark, the questioned portion of Hum\u0101y\u016bn's note, i.e. from dar san chahel, appears to me to read more naturally thus:\n\n\"I am 46. Signed [i.e. he writes, \u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0632\u0627] Muh. Hum\u0101y\u016bn.\"\n\n\"Copied from a copy of a copy of the blessed handwriting of His Majesty\" (Hum\u0101y\u016bn).\n\nThe sentence italicized would then read as a scribe's note.\n\nAs is well known from Mr. Erskine's preface to the Memoirs, he translated from the Persian text, and collated his finished work with the Turki MS., which Dr. Leyden had used. He writes (preface, vii): \"From some marginal notes which appear on both copies of the translation [Persian, B.M. Add. 26,200 and 26,201] as well as on the Turki original [Elphinstone MS.], it appears that the Emperor Hum\u0101y\u016bn... had transcribed the Memoirs with his own hand.\"\n\nNow the Persian note (Memo., 802\u20133) on which is based the statement that a transcript was made by Hum\u0101y\u016bn, is not \"marginal\" in either of the above-named Persian texts. These two only were used by Mr. Erskine. In both, the whole of the passage which Mr. Erskine attributes to Hum\u0101y\u016bn, is incorporated uncritically in the text. Nothing differentiates it in any way. This is true also of all the other Persian MSS. that I have examined.\n\nMr. Erskine, however, chose to use the word \"marginal.\" This raises the surmise that the note may be truly marginal in the Elphinstone Turki MS., since if Mr. Erskine had seen it embodied only in the text, Turki or Persian, it seems probable that some word other than \"marginal\" would have passed from his pen, e.g. interpolated or reproduced from a marginal note. On the other hand, it must be remembered that his considered translation was made from the Persian, and that he collated only with the Turki. If in collating he had revealed to him by a marginal note on the Turki MS., a fact, veiled in the Persian wording, of such great interest as the copying of B\u0101bar's book by Hum\u0101y\u016bn, it would have accorded with his practice in the case of\nvariants elsewhere for him to comment upon the discovery and upon the variation of the texts.\n\nIf Mr. Erskine's reading be correct and indisputably based on the Turki, the copyists of the Persian MSS. have gone wrong, since they vary the note as their copies descend from the original. (Cf. Table, infra.) The reading adopted by the later scribes is of course of little weight, since this is due to the initiative of the earlier ones and in particular and chief of the earliest.\n\nThe later copyists indicate for their work three degrees of descent from the source, viz.:\n\n(a) Copied from a copy of a copy of the handwriting.\n\nGoing back a step, the passage stands:\n\n(b) Copied from a copy of the handwriting.\n\nEarlier than this must have been a form of which I have no examples, viz.:\n\n(c) Copied from the handwriting.\n\nPerhaps this (c) existed only in the Turki texts.\n\nIt seems that the first scribe, i.e. he who wrote as in example (c), either did not read what Humayun wrote in the way Mr. Erskine has read and translated, or that he did not set down his reading so clearly as to prevent his successor from falling into error and adding a 'naql.'\n\nBoth the Persian texts used by Mr. Erskine are worded like example (a), which allows the inference of three descents from the \"blessed handwriting.\" How would Mr. Erskine have worded his translation if example (b) had been before him?\n\nIf the whole of the note under discussion be attributed, as Mr. Erskine has attributed it, to one hand\u2014Humayun's,\nthe reading is strengthened by the use of \u0101n in \u0101n hazrat and not \u0101n. But if the words \"Muh. Hum\u0101y\u016bn\" be taken as a signature and the following words as a copyist's note, the scribe would have no reason to make a distinction between B\u0101bar and Hum\u0101y\u016bn, and the grammatical force of \u0101n would be less. As Mr. Erskine read the passage, \u0101n is applied to the one person named by Hum\u0101y\u016bn, i.e. B\u0101bar.\n\nMr. Erskine's reading is not without a grammatical difficulty, since \"Muh. Hum\u0101y\u016bn\" is the nominative of mong\u016bl shud. Two other points attract attention in Mr. Erskine's translation\u2014\n\n(1) To allow of it, either the word naql, used without limitation, must be read in two senses in the same sentence;\n\n(2) Or the passage contains the information that B\u0101bar wrote down two MSS., since Hum\u0101y\u016bn transcribes from the duplicate (copy, naql) of His Majesty's handwriting.\n\nMr. Erskine uses 'copy' as equivalent to 'MS.' Can a first autograph MS. be truly called, Anglice, a copy (i.e. as we speak of one book in an edition), or Persice, naql, a duplicate?\n\nIf naql be read as 'narrative,' the main difficulties would remain.\n\nIf one were to readjust a little and let in a copyist to account for one naql, an objection of a different nature would be started. Hum\u0101y\u016bn would commemorate the descent of his transcript from B\u0101bar, to the scribe, to himself\u2014an undignified and improbable 'switchback.'\n\nSo much has of necessity been said as to the Persian MSS. that a few discursive complementary words further may be allowed.\n\nIn the thirteen MSS. tabulated below, the note attributed by Mr. Erskine to Hum\u0101y\u016bn is essentially identical as far as and inclusive of the words harara-hu, Muh. Hum\u0101y\u016bn. The word harara-hu, \u062d\u0627\u0631\u0647, was perhaps a puzzle to some of\nthe scribes; it takes various forms, never carries the \u1e37amma, and has sometimes a vagrant dot.\\(^1\\)\n\nAfter the word \"Hum\u0101y\u016bn\" the MSS. show a good deal of variation. This may be seen in the following table. It includes some details of reference, and, moreover, indicates some correspondence between the date of the MSS. and their degree of descent.\n\n\\(^1\\) As illustrating the use of the Ar. \\(\u0283\\) in this expression, Mr. William Irvine referred me to the inscription under the portrait of Jah\u0101ng\u012br which faces p. 115 of Mr. W. Foster's \"Embassy of Sir Thomas Roe,\" and where the parallel expression r\u0101qama-hu is used. The \\(\u0283\\) would explain the abnormal mim on which Mr. Wollaston comments (J.R.A.S., Jan., 1900, p. 71). Mr. Irvine has mentioned to me another instance of \\(\u0283\\) harara-hu, which occurs in the colophon of a B.M. Persian MS., M\u0101ni\u0161u-l-ar\u016bh, by Jah\u0101n-\u0101r\u0101 Begam, daughter of Sh\u0101h-jah\u0101n.\n| Description of MSS.

Elphinstone M.S.: Tuzuk-i-babari (Mems., 183 n.).\n\nThis is the copy translated from by Dr. Leyden, and with it Mr. Erskine collated his finished work. It was purchased in Peshawar by Mr. Elphinstone when on his mission to Kabul in 1809. On Dr. Leyden's death it would seem to have met with some misadventure, since Mr. Erskine speaks of it as \"fortunately recovered\" by Mr. Elphinstone, who had believed it sent to Europe with Dr. Leyden's papers. Mr. Elphinstone, having again become possessed of it, sent it to Mr. Erskine, and thus \"reduced\" him, \"though heartily sick of the task, to the necessity of commencing work once more,\" i.e. of collating his own translation from the Persian and incorporation of Leyden's translation from the Turki, with Leyden's original. This will have occurred before 1816, the date of completion of the Memoirs. Since that time I have found only one mention of the M.S., viz. in a manuscript note made by Mr. Erskine and dated 1848, and I have not found the M.S. It is one of special value and interest; by dwelling at length on my inability to find it, information may be obtained and the precious volume located.\n\nMr. Erskine's note is made upon a flyleaf of the B.M. Tuzuk-i-babari (Add. 26,324), which was once his own. This M.S. is imperfect and disarranged. Mr. Erskine has analyzed its contents. The analysis is followed by the remark: \u2014 \"N.B. The folios 25-38 are wanting in Mr. Elphinstone's copy of the original, now in the library of the Faculty of Advocates at Edinburgh.\" The whole entry is signed by Mr. Erskine, and is dated Edinburgh, 25th December, 1848.\n\nLed by this note, which was and is my only clue to the M.S., I wrote to the Keeper of the Advocates' Library, Mr. J. T. Clark, for permission to see it. He replied that the Advocates' Library did not possess the M.S., and incidentally mentioned that a copy of the Memoirs (Leyden and Erskine) had been missing for more than thirty years. After fruitless enquiry elsewhere for the M.S., I acted upon\nthe coincidence of learning the loss of the translation when I had sought the original, and troubled the Keeper with questions as to the receipt of the Memoirs. It was possibly a gift, I thought, and some record of this might name the MS. This slender clue failed. The annals of the Library lead to the view that Mr. Erskine's work was received in due course under the Copyright Acts. The Keeper assures me as to the MS. that \"recent exhaustive enquiries have failed to show that it has ever been the property of the Faculty of Advocates, there being no entry of it in either of the catalogues of the MSS., nor is it in the manuscript collection uncatalogued, as a recent individual examination of the contents of the MS. Room shows.\" The italics are the Keeper's. The word so distinguished is depressing to those who do not know the safeguards of the Library.\n\nOf course, even Mr. Erskine may have been mistaken, but the reasons which led me to trouble the Keeper with repeated enquiries and to hope for success are not light. They are\u2014\n\n(1) Mr. Erskine's own intimate knowledge of and interest in Mr. Elphinstone's MS. This interest was persistent, as is shown by the memorandum just quoted, which was made thirty-two years after he had finished his translation. His literary work, however, had been faithful to Babariana.\n\n(2) Mr. Erskine made the note in the close neighbourhood of the Advocates' Library, i.e. in Edinburgh.\n\n(3) The note is not hasty or casual. The information as to location of the MS. is designed and carefully inserted.\n\nThe MS. may be in private hands. It is not in any of the great libraries of London, Oxford, or Cambridge. It is not any one of the other MSS. enumerated in these notes. This is shown by consideration of their respective contents. It would be truly regrettable if it were lost. It has special features of great interest, and in particular the note which might decide the question of Humayun's transcript. Mr. Erskine describes it as \"very correct\" and \"unfortunately\nincomplete.\" Its continuous narrative ends before the battle of Kh\u0101nwa\u00b9 (Mems., 355 n.), and a short fragment only follows (Mems., 382 top to 389 top). It is unique amongst the Turki texts which I have seen or know, in the particular that it contains both the notes of Hum\u0101y\u016bn. This is a remarkable distinction. The notes may be autographic.\n\nIn quoting the amratphul note (Mems., 330 n.), Mr. Erskine says: \"There is in the Turki copy the following note of the Emperor Hum\u0101y\u016bn. It is not found in either of the Persian translations.\" Unfortunately he does not quote any Turki words, and it is only from his preface that one infers the note to be \"marginal.\" It would be most useful to know in what way the note is vouched for in the Turki as Hum\u0101y\u016bn's. If with \u1e25arara-hu, this would throw light on the other.\n\nDr. Leyden, as has been said, gives no help, his MS. ending at a point some eighty pages earlier in the Memoirs.\n\nV. B.M. Ada, 26,324. (Title absent.)\n\nMr. Erskine gives, on a flyleaf of this book, the following account of its contents: \"This volume contains scattered fragments of the original Turki Commentaries of B\u0101bar, being apparently some leaves preserved from a copy that had gone to pieces, and which have been bound together out of order. These fragments are six in number, with a portion of a tailpiece containing the name of the transcriber and the date of transcription. The following table will assist in restoring them to their proper place.\"\n\nN.B. The folios 25\u201338 r. are wanting in Mr. Elphinstone's copy of the original, now in the Library of the Faculty of Advocates at Edinburgh. See Memoirs of B\u0101bar, p. 355, note.\" (Signed) \"William Erskine, Edinburgh, December 25th, 1848.\"\n\n\u00b9 By a slip of memory Mr. Erskine (pref., xii) has indicated P\u0101nipat (307) instead of Kh\u0101nwa (355) as the last topic of Mr. Elphinstone's MS. In the intermediate pages (307\u2013355) are eight notes referring to the Turki text, and these include Hum\u0101y\u016bn's on the amratphul.\nThis volume was formerly Mr. Erskine's, and was given to him by Major Yule in 1836. It was therefore not used in the preparation of the Memoirs.\n\nThe tailpiece states that the MS. was transcribed by the \"humblest of those who have charge of the kh\u0101n\u0101d\u0101n,\" Daud, son of 'Ali-u-l-kashmiri, in 1629-30.\" Eight years later this same copyist produced a fascinating W\u0101qi'\u0101t-i-b\u0101bari (which is catalogued as B.M. Add. 16,623), thus working twice after B\u0101bar, once on the Turki and once on the Persian. The latter copy was made at Lahor in 1638.\n\nNeither of Hum\u0101y\u016bn's notes occurs in this volume; their place falls in a lacuna.\n\n---\n\n2. The date of this transcript and its finished beauty testify to the continued interest felt at Akbar's Court in the Turki text. Mr. William Irvine assures me that this interest persisted much later. \"Turki,\" he writes to me, \"was spoken, i.e. understood, at the Mughal Court well into the eighteenth century, and up to that time there were numbers of Qaimaq, Ustak, and Qirghiz women servants and slaves in the harems. Within 50 or 60 years of the Mughal arrival in India, how much more usual must such knowledge have been.\"\n\nBy critics, B\u0101bar's literary style is represented one of the best amongst Turki authors. His language is that of 'Ali Sh\u012br's, the textbook for all who read Turki and who could get access to them. 'Abdu-r-rahim presumably made acquaintance with them in early youth, since there must have been a strong Turki element in his father's household. His mother was a Mewati, and his father died when he was three; but Bairam Kh\u0101n was a full-born Turkom\u0101n, and of a family so distinguished amongst the Black Sheep that tribal position might be a source of pride. Bairam was great-grandson, through a son, of 'Ali Sh\u012br Bah\u0101r\u012b. His mother also was of good Turki birth. One of his wives, Sal\u012bma, was of the same degree of descent from 'Ali Sh\u012br, through a daughter, P\u0101sha. Sal\u012bma married 'Abdu-l-l\u0101h, 'Abdu-r-rahim's eldest brother, brought up with Akbar's sons, of whom it is known that at least Sal\u012bm learned Turki:\n\n'Abdu-r-rahim's parentage and upbringing presuppose familiarity with the Turki language; his bias to learning presupposes that he would early become familiar with one of the masterpieces of that tongue. These things would naturally suggest him to Akbar as a fit translator of the T\u016bzuk-i-b\u0101bari.\n\nThe author of the last fragment of Kehr and Ilminski's text says, in the words of Pavet de Courteille, \"Quant au livre appel\u00e9 B\u0101bariyah, \u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0632\u0627 \u062e\u0627\u0646, fils de Bairam Khan, a \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9 de le traduire du turc en persan pour en faciliter la lecture \u00e0 ceux qui ignorent la premi\u00e8re de ces deux langues.\"\n\nIt is curious to observe that the earliest translation of this T\u016bzuk, by Mirza P\u0101yanda Hasan and Moh. Quli, which was finished in 1588, four years before 'Abdu-r-rahim's, is passed over by contemporaries. It may be noted here that the B.M. copy of this translation does not contain Hum\u0101y\u016bn's notes. They fall in a lacuna.\n\n[Cf. Pers. Cat., Rieu, p. 799; I.O. Cat., s.r. W\u0101qi'\u0101t-i-b\u0101bari; Bodl. Cat., s.r.]\nVI. India Office MS., Bib. Leydeniana, No. 178. (No title.)\n\nThe India Office enjoys the reputation of possessing an unusually fine copy of the Turki Tuzuk-i-bahari. Several a priori considerations lead to the expectation that this will be the Mysore MS. (Tipu's), but the only example of our Tuzuk to be found in the Library is the one named above, which came from Dr. Leyden's collection.\n\nEveryone approaches a famous MS. with deference and pleasurable anticipation, and in the case of the L.O. Turki Tuzuk-i-bahari, I most assuredly was not the proof of this rule. Unfortunately my respectful attitude towards it has been so rudely changed and by a disillusion so complete as to be comic. If I dwell upon my experience here, it is only to emphasize the case of the MS., and for this reason the personal intrusion will, I trust, be excused.\n\nI had asked the loan of this MS., and the L.O. Library Committee had, upon a security bond, heavy as being the value of a book, acceded to my request. Pending final arrangements, I came to know more of our poverty in this Tuzuk, and took alarm at the risk to which a MS. is exposed in a private house, since a forfeited bond is no compensation for the loss of a valuable MS. I accordingly withdrew my request for the loan to be made to myself, and later on, by the kind intervention of Professor Robert K. Douglas, obtained permission for the MS. to be sent to his safe charge in the British Museum.\n\nA passage may be appropriately quoted from the Journal Asiatique (January, 1842) which shows that a hygone savant did not clearly distinguish between Tipu's MS. and Bib. Leydeniana. \"Les M\u00e9moires de B\u00e2bar, \u0628\u0627\u0628\u0631\u06cc \u062a\u0648\u0631\u06a9\u06cc, faisaient partie de la biblioth\u00e8que de Tipoo Sahib, tu\u00e9 le Mai, 1799.\" \"la biblioth\u00e8que enti\u00e8re fut offert \u00e0 l'East India Company, \u00e0 l'exception de quelques manuscrits r\u00e9serv\u00e9s pour la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 asiatique.\" \"C'est maintenant dans cette biblioth\u00e8que, ainsi que nous lisons dans la grammaire turque de Davids qui se trouve l'original des M\u00e9moires.\" The writer of the above has not, however, observed that Davids names Leyden's MS., and not the East India Company's. In 'Heureux les morts,' says Davids, 'l'original de cet ouvrage int\u00e9ressant existe encore et le MS. se trouve dans la biblioth\u00e8que de la Compagnie des Indes. Il appartenait autrefois au feu Dr. Leyden.' The Journal Asiatique leaps from the Mysore MS. to Bib. Leydeniana, No. 178. The former is not found in the Library; the latter is an ancient possession. It was at latest in 1832 that Davids saw it, and presumably, since Dr. Leyden died in 1811, it had passed much earlier into the hands of the East India Company.\nIt is with something like consternation that I find No. 178 unable to account for its reputation. It discloses itself so defective as to provoke the surmise that for some ninety years it has subsisted, in unquestioned honour, upon the fame of another transcript. It has contrived to deceive all round, and up till now, since the latest official utterance about it flatters it as \"complete.\"\u00b9\n\nThe grounds of this unpleasant surmise are as follows:\u2014\n\n(1) Competent advisers assure me that the transcript is modern and of nineteenth-century date. Its former owner, Dr. Leyden, died in 1811. The flyleaves of the binding are water-marked \"S. Wise & Patch, 1805.\"\u00b2\n\n(2) It carries no credentials either of its own rank or of owners earlier than Dr. Leyden. It does not bear the stamp of the East India Company or of the India Office. The sole indication of its ownership is \"Bib. Leydeniana, 2,538\" upon a flyleaf, an entry apparently made in its entirety in the library to which it passed after Leyden's death, i.e. either that of Fort William in Calcutta or of the East India Company in London. (The same flyleaf bears a pencilled \"85\" and an I.O. shelf-mark.) The binding is the identical brown of other books formerly Dr. Leyden's. The transcript has no distinction: no marginal frame, no frontispiece, no colophon, no title, no seals, no rubrics; year runs into year and event into event in the casual fashion of poorer Persian transcripts.\n\nDr. Eth\u00e9's description, which, it should be noted, is placed amongst those of Persian MSS., says nothing of how or when No. 178 passed into the possession of the India Office. It is catalogued as a *Waqi\u02bf\u0101t-i-b\u0101bar\u012b*, but it bears, strictly speaking, no title, since these words are casually dropped by a hand not the copyist's on a binder's flyleaf.\n\n(3) The earlier part of the MS. has been much corrected, roughly and with disrespectful pen. The corrections cease\n\n\u00b9 Cf. Dr. Eth\u00e9's as yet unpublished Catalogue of the India Office Library.\n\u00b2 The flyleaves of a volume of Dr. Leyden's own MSS. (B.M. Add. 26,253) are water-marked with the same names and dated 1809.\nsuddenly. Mistakes occur after this point. Perhaps the attempt at rectification was abandoned.\n\nA few of the errors which lower the character of the MS. for accuracy and careful transcription may be enumerated:\n\n(a) Cf. Ilminski, p. 40, ll. 8 and 6 from foot, \"khalifa\" in each line. In No. 178, f. 42b, the words between the two khalifa are absent. On the same page and in the last line the same fault occurs between two si.\n\n(b) On the earlier pages of No. 178 it can be seen that a considerable number of omissions have been supplied by marginal corrections in a hand not the copyist's.\n\n(c) No. 178, f. 97a, has a marginal note at the beginning of an erased passage, \"az in ja ta nishan-i-digar ghalat ast.\" The complementary nishan is at the foot of f. 98b. Thus nearly two folios are interpolated. This is not a case of simple misplaced folios, since five and a half lines of the text are repeated. These are erased by the corrector at the beginning of the passage, and occur again f. 99a top.\n\n(d) No. 178, f. 223a. Here a few words which introduce the story of B\u0101bar's poisoning by Ibr\u0101h\u012bm's mother (Mems., 347) are followed by a passage about Beg Mirak Mughal (Mems., 352, l. 9; cf. Ilminski, 396 and 402). After a few lines of interpolation the poisoning story is resumed.\n\nOther similar errors might be added to this list.\n\n(4) The MS. is singularly incomplete. This the following table (A) endeavours to show. Details are given to facilitate reference, and these include the initial page of each year. The English translation is the standard of reference, and this reference is further defined by mention of events. Through the events, collation with the French version is made facile.\n\nThe table sets down the minimum of lacuna. A second table (B) notes the gaps by the standard of Ilminski's imprint, and shows the maximum proportion of this which is contained in No. 178.\n| M.M.S. | I.O.

No. 178 refers to the manuscript number.\n- Pages refer to the page numbers within the manuscript.\n- First Tone or each Year or Fragment indicates the beginning of a new year or fragment.\n- Last Tone or each Year or Fragment indicates the end of a year or fragment.\n\nThis table provides a chronological list of events and years mentioned in the manuscript, with references to specific pages where these entries can be found.\nThe four principal gaps in No. 178 swallow 247 pages of the Memoirs, viz.:\n\n| Lacuna (a) | 94 to 246 = 152 - 4 pp. Supplement = 148 |\n| --- | --- |\n| ,, (b) | 272 ,, 290 = 18 - 5 pp. ,, = 13 |\n| ,, (c) | 331 ,, 345 = 14 |\n| ,, (d) | 353 ,, 425 = 72 |\n\nMemoirs' pages lost by lacunae in No. 178 ... 247\n\nN.B.\u2014B\u0101bar's narrative ends with the Gu\u0101li\u0101r passage, Mem., p. 425. The 425 pages include 19 of Supplement (i.e. pp. 123 to 126, 236 to 245, 284 to 289), leaving a total of 406 pages of translation. At the most then, No. 178 contains the equivalent of 159 out of 406 pages of the Memoirs (425 - 19 = 406 translation pages of the Memoirs. 406 - 247 = 159 Memoirs pages in No. 178).\n\nIf we refer No. 178 to Ilminski's imprint we find:\n\n| Lacuna (a) | Ilminski, 111 to 276 = 165 pages. |\n| --- | --- |\n| ,, (b) | ,, 306 ,, 324 = 18 ,, |\n| ,, (c) | ,, 374 ,, 394 = 20 ,, |\n| ,, (d) | ,, 403 ,, 494 = 91 ,, |\n\nIlminski's pages lost by lacunae in No. 178 ... 294\n\nN.B.\u2014Ilminski's 494 pages (to the Gu\u0101li\u0101r passage) are equal to 425 pages of the Memoirs.\n\nAt the most then, No. 178 contains the equivalent of 200 pages out of 494 of Ilminski's imprint (494 - 294 = 200).\n\nThere may be other gaps in No. 178. I have made no further examination.\n\nSome marginal notes in the earliest pages, it is of interest to observe, do not seem to be emendations of mistakes but attempts to harmonize the text with some other. This may be a point of great interest in considering the history of the MSS. Words are struck out and others or phrases are substituted. This occurs certainly in some places where No. 178 is in accord with Ilminski; e.g. No. 178, f. 6a, has two lines marked with a marginal query and the word r\u0101q erased. These lines are in accord with Ilminski, where the r\u0101q occurs (p. 6).\nIt may be that No. 178 is a copy made for Dr. Leyden at the time when his interest was first drawn towards B\u0101bar's book by acquaintance with the Mysore MS. Dr. Leyden obtained it, as may be inferred from the watermarks (1805) of the binding, before he became possessed of the Elphinstone MS., which was purchased in Peshawar in 1808. The intimate relation subsisting between L.O. No. 178, and A.S.B. No. 121, is dwelt upon under the heading of the latter MS. (No. VII). Whether their common defects are due to the 'scamping' of their copyists or are reproductions from their source, I am unable to say.\n\nNo. 178 is annotated here and there by an English hand, in writing which, to the amateur eye, resembles Dr. Leyden's. The same may be said of those Turki notes which I have conjectured attempt to harmonize the text with that of some other example. Corrections of faults seem to be in another hand.\n\nNo. 178 does not appear to have had honour from Dr. Leyden. He did not translate from it. Nor, it may be added, did Mr. Erskine collate it with his translation or name it amongst MSS. which he used or knew. Having regard to his account of his work with Leyden's original (Elphinstone MS.), this seems to be an early disparagement of the copy.\n\nIt may be that the marginal notes, which appear to aim at producing agreement with some other text, are taken from the Elphinstone, one of the MSS. which most unfortunately I have been unable to trace.\n\nThree facts, amongst others available, support the statement that Leyden did not translate from No. 178,\u2014\n(a) The broken passage about B\u0101bar's flight from Akhs\u012b (Mems., 122) is not in No. 178. It, together with the copyist's note quoted by Mr. Erskine and Dr. Leyden's own ejaculation, occurs in Leyden's MS. of his translation from the Turki (cf. B.M. Add. 32,629\u201330).\n\n1 Specimens of Dr. Leyden's English and Arabic writing can be seen in his manuscript remains at the British Museum.\n(b) No. 178 does not contain Hum\u0101y\u016bn's notes; their place occurs on f. 176a, last line, and the passage (marked with asterisks by Ilminski) is absent.\n\n(c) No. 178 ends with a passage corresponding to Mem., 353. Mr. Elphinstone's MS., which was used both by Leyden and by Erskine, ends on Mem., 389.\n\nVII. Asiatic Society of Bengal MS. D. No. 121 (Cat. 1890): \"Tuzuk-i-b\u0101bari.\"\n\nThis MS. was formerly the property of the College of Fort William, and on this ground may earlier have been in Tipu's S\u012bh\u012bb's library.\n\nIgnorance as to the details of the College library system forbids my knowing the import of the date given on a book-plate which, in this MS., is inscribed \"C. of F. W., 1825.\" Many other MSS. formerly in the College and now in the India Office Library bear the same date. One has an interpolated \"[1809]\" before the 1825. This suggests that 1825 is not a date of acquisition, but of binding or cataloguing or inspection.\n\nIf it were a date of acquisition, the fact would make against the supposition that A.S.B. No. 121 came to the College from the Mysore library, because the great gift of the Mysore MSS. to the College was in 1800 (cited).\n\nA consideration which predisposes against the conclusion that No. 121 was in the royal library at Seringapatam is its insignificance. All that has been said of I.O. No. 178 as an undistinguished MS. may be applied to this one. It has no mark of ownership earlier than the College stamp with date 1825.\n\nIt is closely related to I.O. No. 178. Possibly they are parallel in descent, and possibly they are source and copy. In every point which I have examined they are identical. By rough computation, the volume of their\n\n---\n\n1 This I have been able to ascertain by the courtesy of the Council of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, who have sent it for me to the British Museum, through the kind intervention of Professor Robert K. Douglas.\ncontents is the same. Both have the error of transposing the poisoning of B\u0101bar with the affair of Beg Mirak. Both have been much and carelessly corrected. In both are changes which take them out of verbal agreement with Ilminski. Neither has Hum\u0101y\u016bn's note of Memos., 302\u20133.\n\nAt the place of its possible occurrence (circa 339b; there is no paging) the two MSS. are identical, and the text runs on from \"Rahmat piida\" to the \"Sun in Aries.\"\n\nUnlike I.O. No. 178, A.S.B. No. 121 has a tailpiece. It is of no value unfortunately, being merely \"Tam\u0101m shud ain kit\u0101b ba 'aw\u0101n-i-mulku-l-wahhab; tam-tam-tam.\" (These words occur also in No. XI, St. Petersburg University Library MS.)\n\nIf this were the Mysore Tuzuk, one would expect to find its satellite dictionary in the same library. This is not included in either of the A.S.B. Catalogues, at any rate under Stewart's designation of it\u2014Kit\u0101b-i-sarf\u016b nehe turki.\n\nThe size and character of A.S.B. No. 121 are those noted of Tipu's by Stewart.\n\nThis MS. is shown by the \"No. 241\" inscribed on a fly-leaf to be the example catalogued by Zuh\u016br 'Al\u012b Barelawi in A.S.B. Cat. 1837.\n\nVIII. Mysore MS. (Tipu's): \"Tuzuk-i-babari.\"\n\nThis and No. VII may coincide. If they do not, I am unable to locate the Mysore MS.\n\nThe only places where I have seen it mentioned by name are Stewart's Catalogue of the Mysore MSS. (1808) and B.M. Add. 26,583. This latter is a volume of Dr. Leyden's own manuscript remains, the paper of which is water-marked \"S. Wise & Patch, 1809.\" It contains a list of books which \"formed part of the library of Tippu Sul\u1e6d\u0101n, and still [N.B., Dr. Leyden died 1811] remain in the College of Fort William, viz. exclusive of those taken to England by Marquis Wellesley and of the books presented by the prize agents to the Asiatic Society [1808].\" In this list the Tuzuk-i-babari and its satellite dictionary are catalogued.\nIt is not altogether clear whether the MS. went from the College of Fort William to the Asiatic Society of Bengal or to the India Office. Inferentially the following two statements concern it, and would locate it in the library of the A.S.B.:\n\n(1) Stewart (pref., i) writes: \"Marquis Wellesley was pleased to order [circa 1800] that the Mysore MSS. should be transferred [i.e. from the E.I.C.] to Fort William and deposited in the College.\"\n\n(2) In the Centenary Review of the A.S.B., B\u0101bu Rajendra Lall Mitter writes (i, 25): \"On the abolition of the C. of F. W. the whole of its Sanscrit, Arabian, Persian, and Urdu works . . . . were placed [1835] under the custody of the [A.S.B.] Society. . . . . In 1846 . . . . the books and MSS. became the property of the Society.\"\n\nBut there is evidence, as to the first of these statements, that all the Mysore MSS. did not go to the College of Fort William; and as to the second, that all which went to the College did not go on to the A.S.B.\n\nThis can be conveniently seen by consulting Dr. Loth's Arabic Catalogue of the India Office Library in connection with Stewart's Mysore Catalogue. If one takes (e.g.) Stewart's Arabic list (p. 31 ff.), one finds that of ten MSS. named, three went, not to the A.S.B., but to the India Office. (Loth, s.n. Rauzatu-l-abr\u0101r, Muludu-l-nabb\u012b, Bohjatu-l-muhifil.) Dr. Loth notes them as \"C. of F. W., 1825,\" and in the case of the first-named \"C. of F. W., [1805] 1825.\" Another of the same set of ten is marked \"[Tippu],\" from which it would seem that it went neither to the College nor to the A.S.B. This is the Mir\u0101tu-l-jin\u0101n (Loth, No. 706).\n\nDr. Loth's Catalogue has other MSS. marked in both the above ways. It would therefore not be safe to accept either Stewart's or Rajendra Lall Mitter's statement without restriction.\n\nIf we now turn to what points to possession of the Mysore T\u016bzuk by the A.S.B., we find that an example of the\nwork is included as No. 241 in A.S.B. Cat., Zuh\u016br \u2018Ali Barelawi, Calcutta, 1837, 8vo, and again in A.S.B. Cat. 1890 (D. No. 121). In neither place is any description given. This example is our No. VII. As has been said, it bears no marks which may allow of its identification with Tip\u016b\u2019s.\n\nIf now we turn to consider the possibility that the Mysore T\u016bzuk went to the India Office. It is not certain that it went to the A.S.B. The alternative location is the I.O. It is, however, not catalogued in this library.\n\nIt would be strange that the I.O. Library should acquire the reputation of possessing a fine T\u016bzuk, if it had never owned another example than Leyden\u2019s (No. 178). When Stewart catalogued Tip\u016b\u2019s and had to get information as to what it was, from an Afgh\u0101n trader, the rarity of the MS., taken with the almost certain absence of another copy for comparison, would explain an over-estimate by him of an inferior MS. (e.g. if A.S.B. No. 121 were Tip\u016b\u2019s). But this would not account for the high repute in which Leyden\u2019s is held at the India Office. Can the past century, since 1811, have slipped by and left it unchallenged? The publication of the Memoirs aroused interest abroad and at home,\u2014witness the works of Kaiser and Caldecott. Did Mr. Erskine never consult an I.O. copy, who knew well a good MS. (the Elphinstone), and was even in 1848 examining another?\n\nThere is a point in Dr. Eth\u00e9\u2019s Pers. Cat. which stirs hope that the I.O. may possess two T\u016bzuk-i-b\u0101b\u0101ri, and that one is good and the Mysore. The Turki No. 178 (Bib. Leydeniana) is there said to be \u201ccomplete.\u201d Of No. 180, an \u2018Abdu-r-rahim translation, Dr. Eth\u00e9 says that it\n\n---\n\n1 In considering questions of A.S.B. MSS. regard must be had to the great losses of which R\u0101du Rajendran Lall Mitra speaks as occurring from 1856 to 1864, and which exceed 167 in Persian MSS. It is to be feared that losses continue. At the risk of being thought ungrateful for the kindness of the Society which has lent me two MSS., I cannot, when on the topic of losses, omit to say that both these MSS. brought to the British Museum a goodly company of book-worms, plump if sluggish. Both the books have newly cut incisions, the work of the worms. So much they gain by their European trip: they have been dealt with as mummies and quarantined in naphthaline. They will exist at least until their return to Calcutta. Everyone who has lived in Bengal knows the uphill fight for books. Should MSS. be allowed to remain in a climate which favours the book-worm and distavours its pursuit?\ncorresponds with the Turki text, and that both end with the Gu\u0101l\u012br passage. The Turki text he refers to cannot, as the Catalogue stands, but be the \"complete\" No. 178 (Bib. Leydeniana). This, however, does not contain the Gu\u0101l\u012br passage.\n\nHas there been a slip in the printing? Did Dr. Eth\u00e9 describe two Turki MSS., and have the two notices been disarranged and mutilated? Dr. Eth\u00e9 compared Pers. No. 180 with a complete text (i.e. containing the Gu\u0101l\u012br passage). He incidentally names Ilminski's imprint under No. 180, but if he had compared No. 180 with this, he could hardly have avoided reference to Ilminski's continuation\u2014the \"fragments\"\u2014and he would also certainly have compared the Bib. Leydeniana MS. with Ilminski's imprint before pronouncing it \"complete.\"\n\n*A priori* the double mistake in Dr. Eth\u00e9's catalogue seems more probably to have come in at the printing stage than at the time of his inspection of the MSS.\n\nIt is not practicable for me to judge (1) whether the A.S.B. No. 121 is Tip\u016b's, or (2) whether Tip\u016b's came to the I.O. or went to the A.S.B.? To decide this, more acquaintance with library annals and catalogues than is in my reach is needed. If evidence is forthcoming that the A.S.B. T\u016bzak is really the Mysore, a part of what has been said here falls to the ground. It would be satisfactory to find that a more regal and worthy MS. had been Tip\u016b S\u0101\u1e25ib's, and that the I.O. and A.S.B. copies are (scamped) extracts from this.\n\nIX. Bibliotheca Lindesiana (Lord Crawford's).\n\nThis MS. was purchased in Paris at the sale of M. Alix Desgranges in 1865, and is now kept at Haigh Hall, Westmoreland. Its date is estimated in the Bib. Lind. Catalogue as *circa* 1780.\n\nIt is incomplete, ending with Mem., 75, where Qambar 'Ali asks leave to go to his country. It therefore stops far short of Hum\u0101y\u016bn's notes, the first of which is on Mem., 302\u20133.\nIn the lower margin of the last page is a confused signature, of which so much is legible: *dastkhat N\u016br Muh. . . . Ab\u016b'l-fa\u017cl . . . (?)* tam\u0101m. This is written over what may be the catchword of the page next due.\n\nX. Hyder\u0101b\u0101d MS.\n\nMr. Beveridge recently (February, 1900) saw this MS. in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d. It is a fine example, and owned by the family of Sir Salar Jung. I regret that the fuller information for which I hoped, has not reached me in time for insertion.\n\nXI. St. Petersburg University Library MS., No. 683: B\u0101barn\u0101ma.\n\nFor most of the following particulars about this MS. I am indebted to Mr. C. Salemann, the director of the Asiatic Museum in St. Petersburg.\n\nIts former owner was Mirz\u0101 K\u0101\u011fim Beg on whose death in 1871 it was purchased by the University. It was No. 193 in his collection catalogue, and is a comparatively modern transcript which Mr. Salemann thinks, on consideration of the handwriting, may have been made by Mull\u0101 Faizkh\u0101nov (\u0641\u06cc\u0636 \u062e\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0648\u063a\u0644\u064a). Its source is not known, but a marginal note on the last folio reads, \u0627\u0635\u0644 \u0646\u0633\u062e\u0647 \u062f\u0647 \u062a\u0645\u062a\u0645 \u0633\u0646\u0628\u0644\u0647 \u064a\u0627\u0631\u0645\u0634\u0631\u062f, i.e. the original of this copy was written in 1026 (A.D. 1617).\n\nComparison of the dates of transcription shows that it is not Kehr's source, but Mr. Salemann states that its text is \"nearly the same\" as Ilminski's. It and Kehr's may be copies of the same source.\n\nIt has no seals. It ends with the words which conclude the narrative of 935 H. (Ilminski, 494, l. 2). These are followed in the same line by \u062a\u0645\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0628\u0639\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0648 \u062a\u0627\u0628\u0634\u0631\u0648\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0647\u0627\u0628. Then, after a blank, \u0633\u0647 \u0634\u0646\u0647\u0627 . . . . . . \u062a\u0627\u0628\u0634\u0631\u0648\u0628. The colophon runs: \u062a\u0645\u062a\u0645 \u0641\u064a \u0633\u0644\u062e \u0634\u0639\u0628\u0627\u0646 \u0633\u0646\u0629 \u062e\u0645\u0633 \u0648 \u062e\u0645\u0633\u064a\u0646 \u0648 \u0645\u0627\u064a\u064a\u062a \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0623\u0644\u0641, \"Finished on the last day of Sha'b\u0101n in\nthe year 155 after the thousand (i.e. 1155 H., 1742 A.D.).\u201d Kehr\u2019s transcript was made in 1737.\n\nXII. St. Petersburg Foreign Office MS., No. 360 (Cat. 1890): B\u0101barn\u0101ma.\n\nThis MS. was the sole source of Nicolai Ivanovitch Ilminski\u2019s imprint (Kazan, 1857). It was transcribed in St. Petersburg in 1737, from an unnamed source, by Dr. George Jacob Kehr.\n\nA few words as to the life of this German scholar are fitting in view of his important services to B\u0101bariana. He was born on August 8, 1692, at Schleusingen, was educated at Hall\u00e9, and became in 1727 Professor of Arabic and Hebrew at Leipzig. His first book was published in the town of his birth when he was 19. Five of his works\u2014all unrelated to the B\u0101barn\u0101ma\u2014are catalogued by the B.M. and Bodleian Libraries. These were published in Leipzig from 1724 to 1730. One of them deals with Muhammadan coins. In 1731 he was attached to the College of the St. Petersburg Foreign Office, and here, as he tells us himself, became Professor of Arabic, Persian, and Turki. He was also entrusted with the task of elucidating the Muhammadan coins of the Foreign Office.\n\nBernhard Dorn enumerates others of his works, of which one has the great interest of being a Latin translation of the B\u0101barn\u0101ma. Judging by Dorn\u2019s place and mode of entry, this seems to be an imprint in two quarto volumes. The MS. of this work is on the interleaves of Kehr\u2019s transcript of the B\u0101barn\u0101ma. Dr. Kehr\u2019s varied and laborious work marks him as a devotee of literature. He died in St. Petersburg, circa 1760.\n\nKehr\u2019s transcript being, comparatively, so ancient, the greater value attaches to his source. What this was, it is clear that Ilminski did not know; Kehr, he says, tells us nothing direct. All one learns of it, either from Kehr\n\n---\n\n1 A translation of Professor Ilminski\u2019s preface is appended to this article.\nor his editor, Ilminski, is that it contained so many folios, and that in the opinion of the latter it was written in M\u0101varan-negra (? M\u0101varu-n-nahr). Kehr's silence appears to point to the fact that the MS. from which he copied was well known and\u2014of MSS. within his reach\u2014unique.\n\nIt strikes one as singular that Ilminski should not have discovered and mentioned what was Kehr's source. One wonders the more at his silence on the point, because he regrets the defects in Kehr's MS. and is clear in his perception of the need of collation for production of a good text. There must have been difficulties in his way of which we are not informed. It should also be borne in mind that, in publishing his imprint, he did not aim at more than the production of a Chaghatai-Turki textbook. His object was not primarily historical, but scholastic. This comes out clearly in his preface; so that, however much one may regret the limitations he has imposed on himself, one cannot blame him for keeping within them. Still, one regretfully wishes he had been more adventurous in his search for another MS. with which to collate Kehr's. Confessed failure to find one would have been more instructive than silence.\n\nIf, allowing a digression, we pass on from Kehr and Ilminski to the latter's translator, Pavet de Courteille, we are again confronted by a silence, and one still more remarkable, as to the source of the material worked upon. M. Pavet de Courteille relies implicitly on M. Nicola\u00ef Ivanovitch Ilminski. He looks no further back than the printed B\u0101barn\u0101ma of 1857, and does not name the source even of this\u2014i.e. Kehr's transcript. He does not appear to know that Ilminski expresses great obligation to Erskine's translation for the solution of difficulties and the filling up of lacunae. It is therefore not without amusement that he is found in his preface underrating the direct Turki element of the Memoirs (Leyden and Erskine) and highly estimating the purity of his own original\u2014German-copied, Russian-edited, English-amended, and uncollated. While there is nothing in his own preface to indicate that he had\nread the Russian preface of Ilminski, there is a good deal in the latter which leads to the supposition that he had not.\n\nAt the time when he undertook the monumental labour of copying the B\u0101barn\u0101ma and of translating it into Latin, Kehr was Professor in the College which now owns his transcript. As has been said, his Latin version is written on the interleaves of the Turki MSS. Ilminski judges from it and from defects in the Turki text that Kehr was not master of the Turki tongue. He appreciates the patience and exceeding carefulness of the German scribe, and notes that on close examination every sign set down by him proved to have value. In worm-eaten passages the remnants of words were copied, and forms were traced where there had been failure to read sense. These difficult places were amended by Ilminski, with Erskine's help, and are indicated by him in his imprint.\n\nThe St. Petersburg Foreign Office Catalogue, for acquaintance with which in the B.M., I am indebted to Mr. A. G. Ellis, contains an interesting notice of Kehr's work on the B\u0101barn\u0101ma, from which the following passage may be quoted. The annotations of the patient scribe which it chronicles will say a good deal to those readers who are initiated in the same toilsome Way.\n\n\"Le professeur Kehr \u00e9crit de sa main en 1737 cet exemplaire, sur lequel a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite l'\u00e9dition de Kazan de 1857 entreprise par Nicola\u00ef Ivanowitch Ilminski, et la traduction fran\u00e7aise, due \u00e0 la plume de Pavet de Courteille.

Teufel which may indicate an opinion that Pavet de Courteille did not read, or at least assimilate, Ilminski's preface, since he says of some parts of this that Pavet de Courteille \"hat [sie] nicht beachtet oder nicht bekannt\" (D.M.G., vol. xxxvii, 142).\nOF TURKI TEXT OF BABAR'S MEMOIRS.\n\nJacobhr, doctor philosophiae et professor linguae Persicae atque Turcicae in Russo-C\u00e6sareo Collegio.\"\n\nHier endigt sich das achte Zw\u00f6lftheil, folglich Drittheil von dem original Codice des Babar also von den darinnen befndlich 420 Bl\u00e4ttern Restiren demnach noch 140 Bl\u00e4ttern.\"\n\nS. opens with a pious invocation, which I have elsewhere, and has the distinction, rare amongst memoirs, of carrying the narrative down to the time at which even the Persian translation (936 H.\u2014A.D., 1528\u2014425).

No. VI.\n2 Supplementary fragments extend to p. 506.\nBesides giving us this valuable addition of Turki text, which is equivalent to 54 pages of the Memoire, the F.O. MS. has with it the interesting supplements which are well known through the French version. Ilminski regards at least one of these as indisputably authentic, viz. the plain tale of the battle of Kh\u0101nwa. There is no inherent improbability of the authenticity of some other portions, which fill out or carry on B\u0101bar's own narrative. They await the criticism and judgment of an expert.\n\nIt is clear that Kehr's MS. and its attached fragments are likely to yield valuable results. As yet they are practically uncriticized, since uncollated.\n\nBesides the B\u0101bn\u0101ma (Turki and Latin) and the \"fragments\" above referred to, Kehr's great volume contains a second work. It is separated from the first by two blank pages, and is thus described in the F.O. Catalogue:\n\n\"Un autre ouvrage chaghata\u00ef, incomplet d'apr\u00e8s Ilminski dans la copie de Kehr, occupe les ff. 778-836. Une longue introduction vaute la haute mission qui incombe aux souverains terrestres, et particuli\u00e8rement aux monarques musalmans (ff. 784b-787b), apr\u00e8s quoi on lit de courts extraits de la biographie des princes Timurides qui ont r\u00e9gn\u00e9 sur l'Asie Centrale jusqu'\u00e0 Humay\u016bn, sur lequel l'auteur s'arr\u00eate plus complaisamment. En voici la table des mati\u00e8res.\" The names which follow are (stripped of titles): Tim\u016br, Sh\u0101hrukh, Ulugh Beg, Sa'id (K\u0101shghari), Husain (Her\u0101t), Ahmad (Mirz\u0101), Mahm\u016bd (Mirz\u0101), 'Umar Shaikh, B\u0101bar, Humay\u016bn.\n\nAt this point the Foreign Office Catalogue has: \"La date 1126 (1714) qui clot l'ouvrage est selon toute vraisemblance celle de l'original qui a servi \u00e0 Kehr.\" Its position would seem to negative Ilminski's suggestion that it is the date of Kehr's source.\n\nI have had occasion to collate somewhat in detail the\n\n1 Cf. Teufel, I.e., for philological criticism of the \"fragments\" and conjectural source.\nFrench and English versions of the B\u0101barn\u0101ma. This, with some other convergent work, has made it seem to me possible that Kehr's original may claim descent from B\u0101bar's earlier and less polished MS. This view rests, lightly and conjecturally only, upon the following considerations:\n\n(1) Some minor divergencies of statement (omissions, additions, variants), seem to indicate revision.\n\n(2) Kehr's text includes an important passage about the adoption of Hind\u016bl by M\u0101ham Begam, which is not in Erskine,\u00b9 and therefore presumably not in the Elphinstone MS. As a record of domestic life and custom it is interesting, and it is, moreover, the only place where B\u0101bar names Dild\u0101r, the mother of Hind\u016bl, Gulrang, Gulchahra, and Guldadan. Its intimate character, however, would lead to the expectation that it would be omitted rather than inserted on revision.\u00b2\n\n(3) Neither of Hum\u0101y\u016bn's notes is included (cf. Ilm., 340, 372).\n\n(4) With Kehr's MS. is B\u0101bar's plain tale of Kh\u0101nwa. It may have formed part of another MS. It looks as though it were the original for which B\u0101bar substituted Shaikh Zain's ornate farm\u0101n (Mems., 359). This farm\u0101n is in Kehr's MS.\n\nA most interesting passage given by Kehr is that which P. de Courteille (II, 459) entitles \"D\u00e9voument de B\u0101bar.\" It is followed by an account of B\u0101bar's death; and of this Ilinski says that it differs from the B\u0101barn\u0101ma in diction and orthography, and is clearly the production of a person well acquainted with B\u0101bar and his surroundings. He\n\n\u00b9 For a curiously contracted and, as it seems on examination of facts, erroneous parallel passage, cf. Mem., 350.\n\u00b2 Pavet de Courteille, II, 44-5. B\u0101bar's mother is here spoken of in the French translation as alive and active in the episode of the adoption, i.e. in H. 928 (1519). Qutluq-nigar Kh\u0101naw died in 911 (1506-6). Ilinski's words which Pavet de Courteille transforms into \"ma m\u00e8re,\" i.e. B\u0101bar's, are h\u0101r\u016bf ast\u0101n\u0101. This is, I think, the counterpart of safi\u0161\u0101n w\u0101d\u012bn\u0101, the mother of the heir-apparent, here M\u0101ham. To M\u0101ham the context applies.\nhazards the suggestion that it is taken from the introduction to the *Ain-i-akbari.*\n\nAnother of the advantages afforded by Kehr's MS. is that it contains the conclusion of B\u0101bar's adventurous flight from Akhs\u012b (Mems., 122), a passage provokingly interrupted in the Persian translation. It was this rupture that prompted the double note (1) on the Elphinstone Turki text by the copyist\u2014\"The remaining transactions of this year, 908 n., may God grant that they come to hand\"; and (2) on Leyden's manuscript translation of the same text\u2014\"In this I heartily join.\" The St. Petersburg MS. fulfils the petition.\n\nBefore leaving this topic, it is useful to remember that although the Elphinstone MS. appears to be of early date, it was copied from another which was also incomplete, whether by reason of the loss of pages or of unfinished work. The fact is singular in view of the early date of the lacuna and the value of the MS. I have not yet examined earlier Persian texts on this point, and these may contain the passage wanting in No. 26,200.\n\n---\n\n1 The *Akbarname.* In the Biographie Universelle, Ancienne et Moderne, art. B\u0101bar, M. Langl\u00e8s writes: \"Ces Commentaires, augment\u00e9s par Jah\u0101ng\u012br, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 traduits en persan par 'Abdu-r-rah\u012bm.\" Mr. Erskine (pref., ix), who had no acquaintance with the St. Petersburg MSS., expresses doubt as to the statement that Jah\u0101ng\u012br added to the *Waq\u0101\u02bei\u02bf.* It may be that M. Langl\u00e8s' statement is based on the St. Petersburg MSS., and that both scholars are right as far as each knew the MSS.\n\nIt is not groundless to conjecture that S\u0101lim (Jah\u0101ng\u012br) wrote the Kehr MS. fragment about his father's death, character, deeds, etc., under counsel of eye-witnesses. S\u0101lim studied Turki; 'Abdu-r-rah\u012bm was his at\u0101l\u012bq; Gulbadan Begum, whose interest in S\u0101lim is historic, was alive after the presentation of the Persian translation to Akbar by 'Abdu-r-rah\u012bm in 1586, and so too were other contemporaries of B\u0101bar. Jah\u0101ng\u012br (S\u0101lim) says that he made additions to his father's book. Mr. Erskine emphatically states his opinion that as we have them, i.e., he knew them, excluding the St. Petersburg MSS., the Memoirs are as B\u0101bar wrote them. This opinion does not touch the fragments which continue the narrative down to B\u0101bar's death.\n\nThe last fragment, which is by another hand (? S\u0101lim's), (P. de C., II, 463), contains this passage: \"Quand un livre appel\u00e9 *B\u0101barnameh,* Mirz\u0101 Kh\u0101n, fils de Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n, a \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9 de la traduire du turk en persan, pour en faciliter la lecture \u00e0 ceux qui ignoraient la premi\u00e8re de ces deux langues.\" Why was this irrelevant information about the Persian translation inserted? Is it a touch of local colour, as it well might be, if the fragment were S\u0101lim's, and issued from the Turki studies connected with his readings in Turki and 'Abdu-r-rah\u012bm's translation of the *Tuzuk-e-h\u012br\u0101t*?\n\n---\n\nJ.H.A.S. 1900.\nXIII. St. Petersburg Asiatic Museum MS., No. 590:\n\nB\u0101bar-n\u0101ma of Senkovski.\n\nFor knowledge of the existence of this MS. and for the following particulars, I am indebted to Mr. C. Salesmann.\n\nThis copy is known as the B\u0101bar-n\u0101ma of Senkovski, a designation drawn from its colophon, which reads: \"N.B. J'ai achev\u00e9 cette copie le 4 Mai, 1824, \u00e0 St. Petersburg; elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite d'apr\u00e8s un exemplaire appartenant \u00e0 Nazar Bey Turkestani, n\u00e9gociant Boukhari, qui \u00e9tait venu cette ann\u00e9e \u00e0 St. Petersburg.

From the emphatic p\u0101dsh\u0101hi, this title may indicate a distinguished source which seems likely to be the MS. belonging to the brother of the Amir of Bukh\u0101r\u0101 (cf. No. XIV). Senkovski's original was, we learn from the above colophon, copied by Mull\u0101 'Abdu-l-wah\u0101b, akh\u016bnd, Ghazdew\u0101ni, in Bukh\u0101r\u0101, and finished on Tuesday, Rajab 5th, 1121 H. (1709 A.D.).\n\nThe MS. opens with a passage of which I have seen no other example:\nIt is of interest, as indicating Professor Ilinski\u2019s continued occupation with B\u0101bar\u2019s text, to know that this MS. was sent to Kazan for his use, and was returned by him on March 12th (s.v.), 1885. Copied as it was from a MS. belonging to an inhabitant of Bukh\u0101r\u0101, its penultimate source may be No. XIV.\n\nXIV. Bukh\u0101r\u0101 MS.\n\nMr. C. Salemann informs me that his friends in Turkest\u0101n say the Am\u012br\u2019s brother at Bukh\u0101r\u0101 possesses an old and very fine copy which he will not even show to Europeans.\n\nXV.

T. ILMINSKI. (Kazan, 1857.)\n\nThe personality and deeds of the author of the B\u0101barn\u0101ma, Z\u0101hiru-d-d\u012bn Muhammad B\u0101bar, as well as the importance of his book, have been made known in the learned article s.v. B\u0101bar, of the \"Encyclopaedic Lexicon\" (vol. iv). The work itself has been translated into English (\"Memoire of B\u0101bar,\" Leyden & Erskine, 1826). It remains for me to give some information about my edition of the Chaghat\u0101i text. My object in publishing it is to facilitate the study of the Chaghat\u0101i dialect and of Turki in general.\n\nChaghat\u0101i, one of the numerous group of Northern Turki or T\u0101t\u0101r dialects, is the speech of those countries in which science and poetry flourished under Tim\u016br and some of his cultivated descendants. Although in M\u0101varan-negra (?M\u0101varu-n-nahr), as in all Musalman lands, Arabic was exclusively the organ of learning, and although its poets liked to use the language of Sa'di and Hafiz, they did not abandon their mother tongue. The greatest and most important monuments of Chaghat\u0101i literature are the writings of Rubguzi, Mir 'Ali Shir, and B\u0101bar, which belong to the ninth and tenth centuries of the Hijra. Foreign influence is clearly seen in them by the use of Arabic and Persian words and expressions, and not infrequently by the combination of sentences according to the Persian idiom, but, nevertheless, the structure of the sentence itself remains T\u0101t\u0101r.\n\nWe may also conclude that Arabic and Persian had succeeded in influencing equally the conversational language of the more highly educated inhabitants of Mavranragra. No admixture, however, of other Turki dialects can be traced in the above-mentioned writings.\n\nB\u0101bar remarks that the \"common speech of Andij\u0101n is the same as the correct language of composition, so that the works of Mir 'Ali Shir, though he was born and flourished at Heri, are written in this dialect.\" [B\u0101barn\u0101ma, 3; Memoirs, L. & E., 2.] B\u0101bar, writing without pretension to literary style and having\nMSS. OF TURK\u012a TEXT OF B\u0100BAR\u2019S MEMOIRS.\n\nMir \u2018Ali Sh\u012br\u2019s works before him, has undoubtedly preserved his native Andij\u0101ni tongue in all its purity. The writings above-named afford the opportunity of studying Chaghat\u0101i at its best period. Amongst them the B\u0101barn\u0101ma is pre-eminent: since it at once sets forth the author\u2019s personal impressions, is interpenetrated by his character, and shows the natural force, precision, and flexibility of the language.\n\nChaghat\u0101i, if it cannot serve as a basis for the investigation of other northern dialects, can at least afford important help towards forming conclusions as to the essential features of the original form of primitive Turk\u012b. It was spoken in lands close to the cradle of the Turk\u012b tribes, and the nomadic life in which Turk\u012b thought and speech were born offered elements familiar and easy of comprehension to the townsfolk of M\u0101varan-negra, who were in constant intercourse with the wandering tribes. Later on, the primitive faith underwent change (? by conversion to Isl\u0101m) and science introduced new ideas, but, nevertheless, the persistent conditions were more favourable to the preservation of the primitive tongue than of any other T\u0101t\u0101r dialect. Moreover, the Turk\u012b authors named above are more than 300 years older than the T\u0101t\u0101rs of to-day. It follows that we may with greater confidence look to the works of Rubguz\u012b, Mir \u2018Ali Sh\u012br, and B\u0101bar for authentic features of primitive Turk\u012b than to modern dialects, although these are more accessible to us. So far as can be judged by their transcription (i.e. in Arabic character) the Chaghat\u0101i sounds have retained their ancient guttural character and force, and Chaghat\u0101i words form an obvious link between their corresponding words in modern Turk\u012b and the primitive forms from which, by the action of phonetic laws, they have departed. In Chaghat\u0101i the verbal forms are more numerous, more varied, and more comprehensive in meaning than in modern Turk\u012b; and they reveal the origin of the altered forms existing in living dialects, and sometimes explain even their formative elements.\n\nTo serve as a trustworthy basis for the study of Chaghat\u0101i, the B\u0101barn\u0101ma ought to be edited with the greatest accuracy from reliable and, as nearly as possible, contemporary MSS. written by native scribes. Unfortunately the Chaghat\u0101i text is now forgotten.\n\n1 Translation doubtful. I have brought it into agreement with the facts of B\u0101bar\u2019s work.\n2 Perhaps \u201ctransliteration\u201d is better. I am not sure whether the action is from spoken Chaghat\u0101i to inscribed Arabic character or from sounds written down in the Chaghat\u0101i character and transliterated to the Arabic.\nin the very scene of B\u0101bar's achievements; partly owing to the existence of the Persian translation, and partly because of the habitual indifference of Musalmans to works of secular history.\n\nThe sole source of my edition is a MS. which belongs to the School of Oriental Languages at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (St. Petersburg), and which was transcribed by Professor Kehr in 1787. It is an enormous volume of 837 folios, interleaved for a Latin translation. The Chaghat\u0101i text is written in a large, clear hand; the lines are far apart and of unequal length. Kehr gives no important information as to his source, saying merely that it contained 490 folios. At the end of his copy he has entered, in Arabic, the words \"Finished in 1126 [A.D. 1714].\" This is probably the date of his source. From certain orthographical marks and signs which Kehr endeavours to reproduce, we are led to conclude that his original was written in Mavranagra.\n\nIf Kehr's MS. be collated with the English translation of the Babarn\u0101ma, it is found defective in few points only. Of these the following may be named:\n\n(a) Kehr, 188. The Chaghat\u0101i text is interrupted, and in its place is written, in the margin, an extract from the Persian translation, in which also several words are mutilated. I have restored this to its right place in the narrative, and have indicated the passage by asterisks. (*Babarn\u0101ma*, 38\u20139.)\n\n(b) In some places a few words and proper names are missing. Relying upon the English translation, I have indicated them by brackets.\n\n(c) Kehr, 586\u20137. Here occur dotted spaces, which lead one to suppose that this passage was worm-eaten in the original MS. After comparing the remnants of words with the English translation, I have inserted conjectural readings and have indicated these by quotation marks. (*Babarn\u0101ma*, 260\u20131.)\n\n(d) Manifest omissions from Kehr's MS. (f. 672b and 763b) are to be found at the end of his volume (ff. 809b and 813b).\n\nOn the other hand, Kehr's MS. makes important additions to the English version (cf. Mem., 122, and *Babarn\u0101ma*, 144\u20136; Mem., 334, and *Babarn\u0101ma*, 379\u201380):\n\n---\n\n1 Cf. No. 12, Foreign Office MS., where it will be seen that the application of this date to the *Babarn\u0101ma* is of uncertain accuracy.\n(1) The events of 908 A.H., which are broken off in the English version (Mems., 122) at their most interesting point, are completed here.\n\n(2) A detailed account of the revenue of the Indian provinces is given, of which the English version names the total only.\n\nThe text of the B\u0101barn\u0101ma terminates on the last folio of Kehr's copy, but ff. 764b and 809b contain some additions:\n\n(1) A detailed account of B\u0101bar's battle with the Indian r\u0101jas (i.e. R\u0101n\u0101 Sang\u0101), a brief enumeration of subsequent events, and details of B\u0101bar's last illness.\n\nThe last fragment, which begins abruptly, differs in style and orthography from the B\u0101barn\u0101ma. Moreover, the description of the battle with the r\u0101jas appears from some emphatic expressions to have been written by B\u0101bar himself and given to the munshi Zainu-d-d\u012bn, as the basis of his verbose f\u012brm\u0101n. It is impossible to refuse positively to regard this as authentic.\n\n(2) Next comes a curious addendum about B\u0101bar's death, his merits, writings, children, learned friends, etc., by an unknown writer, who was evidently intimately acquainted with B\u0101bar and his surroundings. Possibly it is taken from the introduction to the \u0100in-i-akbar\u012b of Ab\u016b'l-fazl. Both these supplements are placed at the end of my edition.\n\nFollowing the B\u0101barn\u0101ma is a distinct and unfinished work\u2014a brief review of the Tim\u016br dynasty down to Hum\u0101y\u016bn, about whom there are many details.\n\nKehr's determination to devote some months to the labour of copying the B\u0101barn\u0101ma is evidence that he esteemed it highly. His Latin translation shows that he was not fully master of Chaghat\u0101i. There are indications throughout of scrupulous and laborious transcription. Where he failed to read or understand a word he was reduced to tracing, by guess, indistinct signs, and his pen, owing to his inexperience in writing Chaghat\u0101i, of necessity made some lapses and omissions.\n\nFaulty though it be as a MS., Kehr's copy can serve for an edition of the B\u0101barn\u0101ma. Exclusive reliance, however, must not\n\n---\n\n1 This form of translation has been given to me by each of my several helpers. There is a mistake somewhere, since the statement is contradicted both by Iminski's context and by Professor Smirnov's account of Kehr's MS. in the Catalogue of the Foreign Office Library. An appropriate reading would be \"Kehr's transcript contains the last page of the B\u0101barn\u0101ma,\" i.e. the Gu\u1e0di\u0101r passage.\n\n2 B\u0101bariana would be more correct, since the fragments are also indicated.\nbe placed upon it, and other help must be had. For these reasons, I have tried to purify the text of the B\u0101l\u0101r\u0101ma by eliminating, on examination, what seemed faulty in Kehr's transcript. For this purpose the MS. itself served me best, since, after careful scrutiny of every (doubtful) word and turn of expression, I concluded that their employment by Kehr had weight. Next, the English translation was of constant and valuable assistance. Lastly, help was found also in a Chaghat\u0101i-Persian dictionary, published in Calcutta, and in the Chaghat\u0101i-Turki dictionary attached to the works of Mir 'Ali Shir.\n\nI cannot hide from myself that, these being the means at my disposal, it was not possible to make my edition wholly exact and accurate. To have done this it would be indispensable to collate several good Chaghat\u0101i texts. Notwithstanding its defects, I venture to hope that it will prove of use to students of Chaghat\u0101i and of general Turki philology.\n\n1 Variant translation: \"Such is the basis upon which I have tried,\" etc.\nART. XX.\u2014Addenda to the Series of Coins of the Path\u00e1n Sult\u00e1ns of Dehli. By H. Nelson-Wright, I.C.S.\n\nThe work of filling in the interstices left by Mr. Thomas in his Catalogue of Path\u00e1n Coins has of late made such steady progress, that the time would seem to have come to collect the scattered notices of new coins brought to light during the past twenty years, and to prepare a comprehensive catalogue of the coins of this period. Under present conditions the private collector, who desires to know how far his own coins add to the general knowledge, has to devote to his object an amount of research for which he is often little able to spare time, through journals and proceedings to which he possibly may not have easy access.\n\nIn order, however, that the catalogue suggested above may, when it is issued, be as complete as possible, the publication of the rarities in individual collections is an important preliminary, and partly with this idea and partly in the hope of encouraging other similar papers, I have written the present article. To my knowledge there are three private collections which contain a number of coins of the Path\u00e1n period not hitherto described.\n\nTo satisfy myself that the coins here given are unpublished, I have consulted the Journals of the Royal Asiatic Society, the Asiatic Societies of Bengal and Bombay, and the Numismatic Society, together with the Catalogues of the British Museum, the Lahore Museum, and the Indian Museum, Calcutta. Mr. Rodgers's article on the Suri silver coins in the Indian Antiquary has also been examined.\n\nThe coins described are, with very few exceptions, from my own cabinet. By the kind permission of the British Museum authorities I have been able to add three coins\nof Sher Shah, and I hope in a subsequent paper to notice some further Path\u00e1n coins in the Museum Collection which have been acquired since its catalogue was published, and which are new to Numismatics.\n\nThe coins have been weighed in the British Museum.\n\n1.

It may thus be assumed to be an earlier issue than the coin described by Mr. Thomas on p. 46 of the \"Chronicles\" as \"the veritable commencement of the silver coinage of the Dehli Path\u00e1ns.\" This coin came into my hands some years ago from Mr. C.

On the other two, by an inversion of figures, 721 is made to read as [7]16 and [2]17. The former appears to be similar to the coin noticed by Thomas in his footnote to p. 191. On p. 115 of the Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal for June, 1893, Dr. Hoernle, in describing a find of these coins, notices five coins bearing date 726 and three of 727, and remarks in connection with them that \"the coins with the dates 726 and 727 are posthumous. Those of date 727 have not been found hitherto so far as I know.\" I suspect that on these coins only the last figure was legible. The coins now illustrated, however, show that the decimal figure is in both cases \"1,\" and that the coins are not posthumous, but probably, as Mr. Thomas suggests, the work of an ignorant artificer.

This monarch made two expeditions to Sind, neither of which was very satisfactory in its results. The first was concluded by a retreat to Gujrat, while in his second attempt the Sultan got the better of his opponents by starving them into surrender, but only after considerable loss to his own army.

In his fourth and sixth Supplements Mr. Rodgers describes coins\u2014one of which bears considerable similarity to mine\u2014which seem to prove the existence of a Firoz Shah, son of Abubakr. In the present coin the position of 'ibn' in the legend certainly points to the reading Firoz Shah Zafar bin Abubakr Shah. The legend on the reverse also reads from the bottom of the coin upwards. I know of no duplicate. It is unfortunately too imperfect a specimen to be figured.\n\nJ.B.A.S. 1900.\nThis coin has been figured by Dr. Hoernle in the J.A.S.B., 1890, to illustrate the reduplication of \"Sri\" in the Nagri. The mint, however, was not there read. It will be seen that the method of writing the mint name compares closely with that adopted in the coin described above (No. 27). In this case also the ill-formed characters stamp the coin as of Bengal origin.\n\n25. Silver. Weight 171\u00b76 grs. Pl. II, 22.\nDate 949.

Patna was considerably enlarged by Sher Shah and a fort was built there by him. It was also an important mint town in Akbar's reign. I cannot, however, find that it received the name of Hazrat Rasulpur. The coin is, I believe, unique. I figure it in the hope that some collector may possess a duplicate which will aid to a more correct identification. I obtained the coin at Shahjahanpur in the N.W.P. about four years ago.\n\n26. Silver. Weight 160 grs.\nDate 948. Mint, Shergarh. Pl. II, 23.\nThis coin is a variety of No. 346 in the \"Chronicles,\" the legends of which are given above (see No. 23). The\ndifference lies in the fact that the date and mint are in the right margin, and the N\u0101gri in the lower one. This coin belongs to the British Museum.\n\nMr. Thomas identifies this mint with Roht\u00e1s in Bengal, the fortress which Sher Shah took from its Hindu Raja by stratagem. I think it is more likely to be the fort of Roht\u00e1s, near Jhelum, which, we are told by the author of the T\u00e1rikh-i-Sher Shahi, was built by Sher Shah \u201con the road to Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n to hold in check Kashmir and the country of the Ghakkars,\u201d and which he called Little Roht\u00e1s (vide Elliot\u2019s History of India, vol. iv, p. 419). The perfection of the die points to the coin being struck in the Punjab rather than in Bengal. It is worthy of notice, too, that where the title Shergarh was affixed to a town already in being, the older name is given on the coins as an alias: cf. Shergarh urf Kanauj, Shergarh urf Shakk-i-Bhakkar, and Shergarh urf Dehli. It seems probable, therefore, that the Shergurh where this coin was struck was a new town built by Sher Shah.\n\n27. Silver.

I publish it here partly to supplement Thomas\u2019s reading, which ignored the right marginal legend, partly to confirm my remarks on the three d\u00e1m\u2019s of Shergarh, Nos. 28, 29, 30, given below.\n28.

The usual legend.\nMargin. top | \nright | \nbottom | \nleft | \n\nMy object in figuring the obverses of these coins is to bring to notice the reading of the bottom and left margins. Dr. Hoernle, in his useful paper on the Copper Coins of the Suri Dynasty, assumed, in the absence probably of good specimens, that the marginal legend read on this as on other coins of this type. The above coins, however, leave no doubt that the reading is Sher Shah is known (cf. Tarikh-i-Sher Shahi, Elliott, History of India, vol. iv, p. 419) to have destroyed the old city of Dehli and rebuilt it by the Junna, erecting two forts\u2014\"the smaller fort for the governor's residence, the other the wall round the entire city that it might be a Jah\u00e1npan\u00e1h.\" The Shergarh of the coins, except when used in connection with Bhakkar and Kanauj, has hitherto been assumed to be Roht\u00e1s (cf. Thomas, p. 397, footnote). But these coins and the silver coin noticed above (No. 27) show that Shergarh was a synonym of Dehli also. The similarity of the writing of the word 'Shergarh' on the silver and copper coins is striking. I think it possible that the use of the term Shergarh on the coins of Dehli was meant to show that they were struck in \"the smaller fort\" mentioned above as distinct from those struck within Jah\u00e1npan\u00e1h, the larger space round it.\n31.

Square coins of Sher Shah and Islam Shah are known in gold, and the British Museum has a square silver coin of Sher Shah, which was figured\nby Mr. Rodgers in the J.A.S.B., 1894. It is possible that Akbar took his idea of square rupees from the Suris, just as he continued in his copper coinage the system inaugurated by Sher Shah.\n\nNote.\u2014Since this paper went to press I have had an opportunity of seeing the Bodleian coin collection at Oxford.

GRIERSON, C.I.E., Ph.D., I.C.S.\n\nBetween the north-west frontier of our Indian Empire and the P\u0101mir there is a tract of mountainous country inhabited by many different nationalities, speaking many different tongues. The P\u0101mirs themselves are a polyglot region. Taking Z\u0113bik, for instance, the district round it is the home of no less than four distinct speeches\u2014one West-Iranian, Persian, and three East-Iranian, Wakh\u012b, Shighn\u012b, and Ishk\u0101sham\u012b. These last belong to the same Aryan group as Pakht\u014d. To the south-east of the P\u0101mirs we come to the Burushaski spoken in Hunza and Nagar, a language of Scythian stock, whose immediate affinities have not yet been identified. South-east, again, of the Burushaski area we come to B\u0101ltist\u0101n, where another Scythian language, the Tibeto-Burman B\u0101lti, is the vernacular. In the valley of K\u0101shmir, there is K\u0101shmir\u012b, and in the lower reaches of the Jhelum and in the Murree Hills, Chh\u012bbh\u0101l\u012b, both of which are Indo-Aryan, and can be traced up to ancient Sanskrit. West of the Chh\u012bbh\u0101l\u012b tract lies the British district of Hazara, of which the principal language is a form of Western Panj\u0101b\u012b. Crossing the Indus we come to the Northern Pakht\u014d dialect of Pakht\u014d spoken in Peshawar, Sw\u0101t, and Bajaur. West of Bajaur, beyond the Kunar River, we come to Laghm\u0101n. North of Laghm\u0101n lies K\u0101\u016brist\u0101n, through which we again reach the P\u0101mirs.\n\nWe have now described a circle, and it remains to consider the interior portion of this tract. It consists of a number of river systems. The first is the Gilgit Valley, leading\ninto the Indus shortly after the latter debouches from Baltistan. Lower down, the T\u00e4ngir and the K\u00e4ndi\u00f1 fall into the Indus, which has hitherto been flowing westwards, but takes a southerly course after its junction with the latter river. The language of the Gilgit Valley, and of the Indus Valley from Baltistan to the T\u00e4ngir, is Shin\u0101 in various dialects. This form of speech also extends to the south-east of the last-named river, and occupies a large block of mountain country between Baltistan and the valley of Kashmir.\n\nFrom its junction with the K\u00e4ndi\u00f1 to its entry into British territory, the Indus runs in a southerly direction through groups of hills, known collectively as the Indus Kohist\u0101n, and inhabited by a number of wild tribes who all speak varieties of a language of Indo-Aryan origin, which, like Chh\u012bbh\u0101l\u012b, can be traced to ancient Sanskrit, and which is called Indus-Kohist\u0101ni or Maiya. Colonel Biddulph has given us vocabularies of two of these dialects under the name of Gowro and Chiliss. The Linguistic Survey of India, on which I am at present engaged, gives further details, including a brief grammar and specimens.\n\nTo the west of the Indus-Kohist\u0101n lie, in order, the valleys of the Sw\u0101t, the Panjk\u00f6r\u0101, and the Kunar. Those of the first two are known as the Sw\u0101t- and Panjk\u00f6r\u0101-Kohist\u0101ns respectively. Here the language of the bulk of the people was formerly an Indian one, allied to Indus-Kohist\u0101ni, but is now, owing to Path\u0101n domination, almost invariably Pakht\u014d. Only a faithful few still cling to their ancient language, though they have abandoned their Aryan religion, and the dialects which they speak are called G\u0101rw\u012b and T\u00f6rw\u0101li. These three, Indus-Kohist\u0101ni, G\u0101rw\u012b, and T\u00f6rw\u0101li, together form one well-defined group of languages, Indo-Aryan in origin, and evidently descended from ancient Sanskrit. They form a connecting link in the chain of North-Western Indo-Aryan languages, commencing with Sindhi, and passing via Western Panj\u0101b\u012b, through them, into Chh\u012bbh\u0101l\u012b and\n\n1 The sign ~ over a vowel indicates a nasal pronunciation.\nK\u0101shmiri. The Survey has made available grammars, vocabularies, and specimens of all of them. In this part of the country, Pak\u0161t\u014d itself hardly gets further west than the hills forming the eastern side of the Kunar Valley. Nowhere does it cross that river.\n\nNorth of the \u0160w\u0101t and Panjk\u014dr\u0101 Valleys we find the country of Chitral, lying on both sides of the Kunar River, which is here known as the Q\u0101shq\u0101r, Chitr\u0101r, or (to Europeans) Chitral. The main speech of this country is called Chitr\u0101r\u012b, or Kh\u014d-war, and is spoken as far east as Yasin, where it marches with Burushaski and Shin\u0101. Kh\u014d-war is evidently related to the latter language. They form a pair belonging to the Irano-Indian stock, and to the Indian branch of that family. They are hence to be classed as Indo-Aryan. This is at once established by a consideration of their phonetic systems, but their grammars present certain peculiarities which will be alluded to shortly.\n\nThe two main affluents of the Chitral-Kunar River are the Bashgal and the Waigal, both of which join it on the west after passing through the hill country of K\u0101firist\u0101n. The first-named is the most northern, and takes its rise in the southern face of the Hind\u016b Kush. It joins the Chitral near the village of Nars\u0101t. The Waigal, after itself receiving the waters of the W\u0113zgal, falls into the Chitral some way below Asm\u0101r. It is formed in the interior of K\u0101firist\u0101n. The Valley of the Bashgal is the home of the Bashgali language, which is the speech of the Siah-p\u016bsh K\u0101firs generally. A vocabulary and a few grammatical forms have been published by Colonel Biddulph, and a formal grammar by Colonel Davidson is now, I believe, in the press. East of the Bashgal Valley, Was\u012b-veri, another K\u0101fir language, is spoken in the W\u0113zgal Valley. A grammatical sketch, specimens, and a vocabulary of this will be published by the Linguistic Survey. It is evidently distantly related to Bashgali, and, like the remaining K\u0101fir languages, is spoken by the Sufid-p\u016bsh K\u0101firs. These remaining ones are Ashkum, spoken in the heart of the K\u0101fir country, and Wai, the language of the Waigal Valley. Regarding\nAshkun, no information of any kind is as yet available. All the efforts of my kind friends in Chitral and the Khaibar Pass have been unavailing. For Wai, we have some vocabularies of doubtful authority. This exhausts the list of the known languages of K\u0101f\u012brist\u0101n. The two about which we have any certain knowledge, Bashgali and Was\u012b-veri, are, like Kh\u014d-w\u0101r and Shin\u0101, certainly Indo-Aryan in their phonetic systems, but, also like them, possess grammars which present difficulties to the student.\n\nWe know that in prehistoric times the Aryan, or Irano-Indian, language split up into two, an Iranian and an Indian. We know also that the Iranian again split up into two branches, a Western and an Eastern. The modern representative of Western Iranian is Persian, and the most important one of Eastern Iranian is P\u0101ksht\u014d. The modern Indo-Aryan vernaculars are the present-day representatives of the Indian branch. These three branches are recognizable by well-defined phonetic laws. A convenient shibboleth is the Persian dast, \u2018a hand,\u2019 which corresponds to the P\u0101ksht\u014d l\u0101s and the Indian h\u0101\u1e6dh or hast. These four languages\u2014Was\u012b-veri, Bashgali, Kh\u014d-w\u0101r, and Shin\u0101\u2014agree in following the Indian phonetic system, but in some grammatical particulars they show remarkable points of agreement with the Eastern Iranian tongues. The modern Indo-Aryan languages can all be traced back to the ancient Sanskrit spoken in Vedic times. This is true both of their phonetic systems and of their grammars, but by no course of derivation with which I am at present acquainted can I recognize the Sanskrit originals of some of the grammatical forms presented by these four. This may be my fault; it very possibly is so, for we lack the connecting link between them and the ancient language from which they are derived, which we possess in the Prakrits for the vernaculars of India. If we had such a link, i.e. specimens of the mediaeval language spoken below the Hind\u016b Kush, the affiliation of the four with Sanskrit might be easy, but till this is the case, the most that we can say is that while their phonetic system is the same as\nthat of the Sanskrit-derived languages spoken further south, we are unable to say positively that they are derived from the Sanskrit with which we are acquainted. Judging from the well-ascertained facts regarding the origin of the modern true Indian languages, we may argue from analogy and say that it is probable that the four were derived from Sanskrit, but how they were derived, and by what stages, we are not at present able to say. This fact, together with the remarkable circumstance that some of their grammatical forms agree with those of the Eastern Iranian languages, has led certain scholars to suggest, with at least equal probability, that while the four are undoubtedly Indian, they are not necessarily Sanskritic, but are descended from a mother-dialect closely akin to Sanskrit, of which, possibly, ancient Sanskrit was a further developed form. This mother-dialect was, so to speak, left behind below the Hind\u016b Kush, while the bulk of its speakers went on into India, and there founded the Indo-Aryan civilization, and the Indo-Aryan speech. While it is impossible in the present state of our knowledge to prove this contention, it can at least be said to be not impossible, and to explain some difficult points. If it is true, then the four languages represent a stage of the Indian branch of the Aryan family older than Sanskrit, a stage which had already developed all the phonetic system of that branch, but which still retained some linguistic connection with its Iranian sisters on the other side of the Hind\u016b Kush. It only remains to state that there is no sudden change between these languages and the definitely Indian ones of the North Panjab. The two sets merge into each other by stages. The first stage consists of the Kal\u0101sh\u0101, Gawar-bati, and Pashai languages, about which I am now going to speak, which are almost certainly Sanskritic, yet still show remarkable points of contact with\n\n1 An interesting point of agreement between these four languages and the Eastern Iranian ones is the infinitive in k. Thus, with the Eastern Iranian W\u0101kt of the P\u0101mirz, chulg\u0101k, \u2018to desire,\u2019 and the Orm\u016br\u012b of Waziristan, gheik, \u2018to say,\u2019 compare the W\u0101si-veri pesum-timik, \u2018to beat,\u2019 the Kh\u014d-war b\u012bk, and the Sh\u012bn\u0101 b\u014dk\u0101, \u2018to become,\u2019 and, finally, among languages to be dealt with later on, the Kal\u0101sh\u0101 hik, and the Gawar-bati and Pashai b\u012bk, \u2018to be.\u2019\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1900.\nKh\u014d-w\u0101r; and the second of the K\u014dhist\u0101n languages already described, which are quite certainly of Sanskrit origin. This points us to a state of affairs in the olden time which is just what might have been expected, viz. the old parent language of the four gradually merging into its sister, the Sanskrit of the north-west of the Panjab, by insensible gradations, and not separated from it by any hard and fast lines.\n\nThe Kal\u0101sh\u0101 K\u0101firs dwell in the d\u016b\u0101b between the Chitral and Bashgal Rivers. They have a language of their own, which is called by their tribal name. Dr. Leitner gave some information about it many years ago, which has now been supplemented by the Survey. Lower down the Chitral, at the juncture with the Bashgal, in and about the country of Nars\u0101t, dwell the Gawara, who also have a language of their own known as Gawar-bati, or Gawar-speech, of which a vocabulary was given by Colonel Biddulph under the name of Narisati. Still lower down, on the right bank of the Chitral, which has now become the Kunar, dwell the Pashais, who also have a language of their own. Pashai is spoken as far west as Laghm\u0101n, and extends as far north as the Waigal Valley, though whether it is the same as the Wai K\u0101fir already alluded to I have not yet been able to determine satisfactorily. At any rate, it is by far the most western outpost of the Indo-Aryan languages. It is an island of Indian speech in the heart of Afghanistan, and is bounded on the north by the K\u0101fir dialects and on the other three sides by Pak\u1e63ht\u014d. These three languages, Kal\u0101sh\u0101, Gawar-bati, and Pashai, are all very closely connected. They are certainly Indo-Aryan, and nearly certainly Sanskratic, though it must be pointed out that they possess some of the typical grammatical peculiarities of the four languages with which we have just been dealing.1\n\nKal\u0101sh\u0101, whose habitat is close to that of Kh\u014d-w\u0101r, possesses most points of continuity with that language, and forms a bridge between it and the other two, which in their turn\n\n---\n\n1 For instance, the infinitive in k to which attention was called in the last footnote.\nbridge over the gap between Kal\u0101sh\u0101 and the undoubted Sanskritic languages of the Panjk\u014dr\u0101, \u0160w\u0101t, and Indus Kohist\u0101ns.\n\nTo complete this list of languages spoken on the north-west frontier, wandering shepherds, known as Gujar\u0101s, inhabit the country between the Kunar and the eastern border of K\u0101shmir, and perhaps still further to the east. These have a language of their own\u2014a purely Sanskritic one\u2014which, curiously enough, is nearly the same as the M\u0113w\u0101r\u012b spoken in distant Rajputana, and is closely allied to Gujar\u0101t\u012b.\n\nFull descriptions of Kal\u0101sh\u0101 and Gawar-bati appeared in the papers which I had the honour of presenting to the last Oriental Congress. Since then, through the kindness of Mr. J. G. Lorimer, I.C.S., Political Officer of the Khairar, I have received complete specimens of Pashai, and, as this language has hitherto been almost unknown, the following further particulars concerning it will be of interest. The only information which up to the present time has been available has been a short list of 'Pushye' words by Burnes, and two brief vocabularies, one of Laghm\u0101n\u012b and one of Pashai by Leech. Leech was under the impression that these two were distinct languages, but really the names only connote two dialects of the same form of speech.\n\nPashai, properly speaking, is the name of the language spoken by the D\u0113hg\u0101ns of Laghm\u0101n and the country to the east of it. It is also called Laghm\u0101n\u012b from the tract in which it is spoken, and D\u0113hg\u0101n\u012b, because most of its speakers belong to the D\u0113hg\u0101n tribe. The boundaries of the language are said to be, roughly, on the west the Laghm\u0101n River, on the north the boundary of the K\u0101firs, on the east the Kunar River, and on the south the K\u0101bul River, but the riverain villages on the left bank of the K\u0101bul speak Pak\u1e63ht\u014d, not Pashai. A certain number of Pak\u1e63ht\u014d-speaking communities are also found interspersed\n\n---\n\n1 The only importance of this list is that the spelling of the name misled Lassen, who put it down, on Burnes' authority, as a distinct language. I owe this piece of information to the kindness of Dr. Kuhn.\n| FAMILY | GROUP | LANGUAGE | DIALECT | WHERE SPOKEN |\n|--------|-------|----------|---------|--------------|\n| Sertian | Tibeto-Burman Western (Ghulbhab sub-group) | Burushaski, Khojunti or Kunjast Tibetan | Standard Warakhwer B\u00e2lti Balakht\u00e2hi | Hunan and Nagar.

It is said to be principally peopled by Gujars who speak their own language. There are several sub-dialects of Gujar\u00ed which differ slightly from each other.\nat other places within these limits. The principal places and neighbourhoods in which Pashai is spoken are Barkot, Sutan, Waigal on the side next the Kafirs, Janjapur, Amla, Surch, Badiiali, Islampur, Badshau Kele, Balatak, Kunada, Deogal, Nurgal, Chaman, Najil, Sui, Kulman, Tagao, Siu, and Kulab. Some of these are considerable tracts. The number of people speaking Pashai has been estimated at 100,000, and with regard to the Pashai region and its probable character this estimate does not appear to be unduly large or unduly small.\n\nThere appear to be different dialects of Pashai, but the variations are said to be not great. The distinction drawn by the people themselves is between the 'harsh tongues' of the hills and the softer tongue of the more level country. I have myself examined specimens in two dialects, a western and an eastern. The differences are mainly ones of pronunciation. Thus, the short \\(a\\), which is so common in Pakhto, also occurs in the eastern dialect, but usually appears as a long \\(e\\) in the western one. For instance, Eastern puthi, Western puthi, a son. Again, an Eastern sh becomes a Western kh, as in Eastern shuring, Western khoring, a dog.\n\nIn order to explain the accompanying map, I append a table giving the names of the various languages spoken beyond the North-Western Frontier of India, with their dialects and habitats.\n\n1 The small \\(a\\) above the line indicates the very short \\(a\\)-sound known as the fatha-e afghani, which is so common in Pakhto.\n\n* One of these is called Kulmani from being spoken in Kulman.\nART. XXII.\u2014The First Preparers of the Haoma (Indian Soma).\n\nThe Pahlavi translation and commentary on Yasna IX, 1-48 inclusive, for the first time edited with the collation of MSS., and now prepared from all\u00b9 the MSS. also deciphered. By Professor Lawrence Mills.\n\nAs this edition of a short section of the Pahlavi translation of the Yasna is intended to be followed by similar publications ultimately embracing the entire Pahlavi texts of the Yasna with the exception of those which have been already treated in my Five Zarathushtrian G\u0101thas, I make here full allusions to the MSS. which have been consulted in producing it.\n\nThe oldest codex provided with a Pahlavi translation is that catalogued as G I among the Zend MSS. in the Bodleian Library; but also known as J\u00b2, referring to its former possessor, the late revered Destoor Jamaspji Minochoherji Jamasp Asan, High Priest of the Parsis in Bombay, by whom it was generously given to the Bodleian Library at the suggestion and on the responsibility of the present writer in July, 1889. It was at the time on private loan to me in domicile in Oxford, and from my residence it went to the Library. In this present article this MS is designated as D.J. (Destoor Jamaspji), as it was so designated by me in my first interrupted edition of the Five Zarathushtrian G\u0101thas many years before the MS. came to Europe for the first time, I having had possession of a collation of it kindly loaned by Dr. E. W. West. As I began with the designation 'D.J.' in the book referred to above before any collation of it had ever been published, and as I continued this usage in my G\u0101thas later, I preserve it here.\n\n\u00b9 With the exception of that numbered 4 in the Meola Firuz Library in Bombay, which is, however, practically identical with D. (Pt. 4), being a copy from the same original.\n[I should in passing recall the fact that this MS. was collotyped in its full original form and published by the Clarendon Press with an introductory note by me, as its Zend Avesta text had been entirely translated as collated in vol. xxxi of the Sacred Books of the East, and both the Avesta and the Pahlavi texts had been edited and translated as collated in the book referred to above. This collotyped facsimile may still be had of the publisher; see his latest catalogue. The volume consists of some 770 odd large pages (collotyped photographs), and is a most masterly piece of artistic workmanship completed at the Clarendon Press Works in Oxford. The actual tint of the ancient paper has been preserved, and is well set on a ground of brilliant white manufactured, as I believe, for such a purpose.]\n\nThe MS. which I termed D. was so called from Destoor Darab Peshotan Sanjana, the son of its late possessor, Destoor Doctor Beramji Sanjana, M.A., Ph.D. Here again I was first indebted to the kindness of Dr. E. W. West, who included a partial collation of it with Spiegel's text, in the same copy which contained the first collation of D.J. (CI or J\u00b2); see above.\n\nThis very valuable, but apparently not very ancient, MS. was later kindly loaned by its possessor the Destoor in Bombay to me for my use in domicile in the year 1890. And while it was present in Oxford, permission was accorded by the owner to have it collotyped. This was accordingly done at the expense of the Bodleian Library, with the result that we have a most effective facsimile, even more convenient for use (because safer) than the original MS. itself; and this is the document which has been used for this second time for the present purpose. Its press-mark in the Bodleian Library is Zend, d, 2. It is elsewhere referred to as Pt. 4. (I had termed it D. years before it came to Europe.)\n\nThe third MS. used for the present section is that numbered 12a of Haug's Collection in Munich.\n\nBoth its Pahlavi text and its Parsi-Persian translation stand in the Perso-Arabic character. It has, however, two\nitems which especially recommend it. First, it is said to have been transcribed by a person who was not a Parsi, a certain Mohammedan, as I am informed, and this shuts out the most mischievous source of all error in ancient documents, namely the inconsiderate zeal of the would-be emender. And secondly, the individual (P) in many parts of his work seems to have been afflicted with extraordinary caution, not to say timidity, refraining from translation where he felt the smallest doubt, and so erring on the side of safety. On the other hand, the MS. in some places is carelessly written as if in haste, and this makes it at times very difficult to decipher. To an eye constantly practised by reading Persian it is, however, seldom hopelessly obscured, especially when compared with the Zend, with the ordinary Pahlavi, and with Nery\u014dsang. The codex was kindly sent to the Bodleian Library for my use only last year, in February, 1899; but the second part, or volume, of it had been most cordially sent me in Hanover for my use at the end of the seventies.\n\nI do not designate the variations in its Pahlavi text from my own text or from that of Spiegel, not merely because its transliterations are of the old traditional type, and therefore more difficult to the student, but because it is my intention to edit it in its entirety, as I did that portion of it which reproduces the G\u0101thas (see the edition).\n\nThe fourth MS. is that leading one of Haug's Collection which I note as M. This codex, like the one just mentioned, was kindly sent to the Bodleian Library by the librarian of the Hof und Staats Bibliothek in Munich (much earlier than the others) in the year 1887 (April 5th), for my use in perfecting my text of the Pahlavi translation of the G\u0101thas; and naturally I did not fail to transcribe its variations from Spiegel's printed text throughout. It is correctly considered to be a transcription from Copenhagen 5, but as it differs clerically in many places from Spiegel's text, it cannot be an absolutely exact copy in so far as Spiegel's text approaches that description.\n\nFifthly, I carefully noted the chief variations in the codex\nof Yasna fragments from Haug's Collection, which consists of fragmentary texts, and which was sent for my use to the Bodleian in 1889 (May 25th). The variations have not very often been reproduced, as the texts differed in places so widely as to make it hardly fair to call a comparison of the document (with the others at hand) a 'collation' as of the same general texts. I term it Mf.\n\nSixthly, I regard Spiegel's printed text as being like M., in view of his notes to it, a valuable approximate transcript of the ancient codex 'Copenhagen number five' already referred to.\n\nThese are all the Pahlavi MSS. of the Yasna of which I have any accredited knowledge, with the exception of the one numbered four in the Moola Firuz Library in Bombay, to which reference has been already made in the note on p. 1 as practically identical with D. (Pt. 4), and it is therefore in so far replaced by that codex.\n\nI should mention, however, three very valuable Zend MSS. with Sanskrit translations (texts of Neryosang) which have been most kindly placed at my disposal, being sent to me personally in Oxford from Bombay by distinguished friends. The first is one which I describe as J*, loaned to me by the late revered Destoor Jamaspji Minocherji Jamasp Asana, and which is destined by his son and successor to be a gift to the Bodleian Library when I have finished my use of it. It was executed by an ancestor of the Destoor some time in the seventeenth century. I have described it more fully in the Transactions of the Ninth International Congress of Orientalists, vol. ii, p. 523. Another is the MS. sent me by the courtesy of the owner, Mobed Mancherji Barozji (?) Powri. The codex was formerly in Surat; and it has been lately referred to as S'. On opening it, I was immediately struck by the strong resemblance of the paper in texture and in tint to that of our Oxford MS. referred to above as D.J. (C I Bodleian, or J*).\n\n---\n\n1 The numbering has, I think, been changed since I made my request for it to the Librarian; I therefore do not quote it.\nhas some points of similarity; but it also shows traces of\nthe workmanship of different penmen. It extends from\nYasna 1, 6 to Yasna 46, 19 (unfinished).\n\nA third is a small MS. somewhat darkened by the rubbing\noff of the heavy ink upon the coarse paper; but it is\nevidently a codex of the greatest value. It only extends,\nhowever, from Yasna 1, 6 (1\u20135 prefaced by a later hand) to\nYasna 19, 10 (in middle). It bears the two names\u2014one\nMeher Naurozji Kutar in the interior at the end, and\nthat of Mr. Manockji Perloz* of Orv(a)ola* (so?) on the front\nexternal cover. It has been bound for convenience, and this\nsomewhat cramps its texts. I am on the point at present of\nreturning it to Bombay. It was procured for me, as was\nS', through the most kind influence of my learned friend\nthe Rev. J. J. Modi, Head Priest of the Parsis in\nColaba near Bombay, and Secretary to the Trustees of the\nSir J. Jejeebloy Translation Fund. I will take another\nopportunity to describe it more fully. (Still another MS.\nof the Yasna was sent me at the same time, but it is\ndecidedly modern.)\n\nThese three Zend-Sanskrit MSS. have been used to correct\nand confirm the text of Nery\u014dsang, which, of course, as in\nthe G\u0101thas, I have closely consulted for my Pahlavi text.\n\nIt is with these materials that I offer my deciphered\nversion, incomparably more difficult, though less impressive,\nthan merely reproducing the original Pahlavi characters\nwith no attempt to render their very obscure equivalents\nin our intelligible Latin letters.\u00b9 And surely when we\nemploy the printer to impress documents in letters which\nwe ourselves do not explain, our occupation is not a very\ndignified one.\n\nReferring to my venerated predecessor in this attempt,\nlet me say that our indebtedness to our eminent bahntrecher,\nProfessor Frederick von Spiegel, is very great for having\nprinted for us a text from one codex. It stands, however,\n\n\u00b9 I hope to add the text in the original characters in a future issue of this\nJournal.\nto reason that his valuable work would have been greatly improved had he gained access to more than a single version. I reserve an English translation of my own text for a future work, or for future articles, in which I hope to re-edit Nery\u014dsang's Sanskrit texts and treat the whole subject synoptically as I did in the G\u0101thas.\n\nI beg, however, emphatically to call the attention of searchers to the remarks made in the Introduction to the Five Zarathushtrian G\u0101thas and in my contribution to the Transactions of the Ninth Congress (see above) as to the peculiar treatment necessary in explaining these quasi verbatim renderings of the Pahlavi commentators. An ordinary literary translation of them, such as would be naturally attempted by an unguarded writer, would be worse than useless, for it would be calculated to mislead investigators as to the true character of the work, so affording an excuse for superficial procedure from an ill-informed exaggeration of the inevitable defects. It was truly astonishing that no-one, not even those who most adhered to the importance of the Asiatic commentaries, had ever thought of guarding against the most obvious sources of error. First of all, the texts are thrown out of all natural order (as Pahlavi writings) by being forced to follow the order of sequence of their original the Zend, while the order of sequence of the words in a good Pahlavi sentence is of unusual importance to the syntax. They also offer, what had never been noticed, which is more than a single translation for the same word, the result of the frequent attempts of previous versions. But I need say no more here save to point the principle, fully acceded to verbally by scholars (old acquaintances of my own in Germany). A translation of the Pahlavi translations should be 'exposition,' interrupted at every step with explanation or additional translation of the alternatives.

XXIII.\u2014Notes on Indian Coins and Seals. Part III.\nThe Kul\u016btas, a people of Northern India. By E. J. Rapson, M.A., M.R.A.S.\n\nThe identification of the kingdom of Kul\u016bta, which Hiouen Thsang visited, with the present valley of Kullu seems to be quite beyond dispute;\u00b9 and the lapse of more than twelve centuries and a half has effected so little change in the conditions, that Hiouen Thsang's description and the account in Hunter's Gazetteer are curiously similar. Like its neighbour the kingdom of Chamba (Skt. Canpaka), it belongs to the eastern or J\u0101landhar group of Hill States in the Panjab.\u00b2 At present this group consists of twelve states, but, according to Cunningham, there were formerly only four\u2014J\u0101landhar, Chamba, Kullu, and Mandi. Of the first and third we have a detailed description by Hiouen Thsang,\u00b3 and, as will be seen (infra, p. 541), it is possible that he mentions the second under another name. In our attempts to unravel the tangle of ancient Indian geography, the untying of one knot fortunately often leads to the untying of others. The identification of the Kul\u016btas may enable us to identify, with a greater or less amount of certainty, other peoples who occur with them in the geographical lists. It may, therefore, serve a useful purpose, if we examine in detail all the known occurrences of the Kul\u016btas in literature and on inscriptions and coins.\u2074\n\n\u00b9 Cunningham: Ancient Geography of India, p. 142.\n\u00b2 Id., pp. 130 ff.\n\u00b3 Id., p. 136.\n\u2074 For these references, I am indebted to Fleet's Topographical Index to the Pehelvanshikas; Cunningham's Ancient Geography of India; Wilson's Rajputana (ed. Hall); Teleg's Madhurakshasa (Bomb. Skt. Ser.); and the P.W.\nHouen Thang: (in India A.D. 629-645.)\n\nHouen Thang's visit to the kingdom of Kuluta is described in the fourth book of his travels. From Chi-no-po-ti (Chopati - the modern Patti, according to Cunningham), he had proceeded to Shr-lan-to-lo (Jalandhara, called also Rajgirha), thence to K'in-lu-to (Kuluta), and thence to Shu lo Po lo (Sahdra, the kingdom of the Satlaj). About the identification of these places, broadly speaking, there can be little doubt. In his account of Kuluta, Houen Thang also gives the directions and distances of two other places, Lo-sa-lo and Mo-lo-so (possibly to be read Mo-lo-po), though it appears that he did not visit them, but obtained his information about them from hearsay. The former has been identified with Ladakh; but with regard to the latter there is a difference of opinion. Cunningham identified it with \"Mar-po, the actual name of the province of Ladak\"; but Vivien de St. Martin, on the strength of a note inserted by the Chinese editor to the effect that another name for the place was San-po-ho, has no hesitation in identifying it with Canpaka. It must be admitted that neither the direction nor the distance given by Houen Thang suits the position of Chamba in relation to Kuluta. But he may have been misinformed, or a mistake may have crept in from some other source. San-po-ho must surely be intended to represent Chopati, but the Chinese editor may have been mistaken in supposing it to be another name for Ladakh. We shall have occasion to continue the discussion at this point hereafter (p. 541).\nMah\u0101bh\u0101rata.\n\nThe Kul\u016btas are mentioned in the topographical lists contained in the Bh\u012b\u1e63ma-parvan of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata under the guise of a description of the country of Bh\u0101rata given by Sa\u00f1jaya in answer to a question of the blind king Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra. These lists are included in Wilson's translation of the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-pur\u0101\u1e47a. They are, no doubt, late additions to the epic,\u00b9 and, like other similar catalogues of names of persons and places given in the Pur\u0101\u1e47as, are now, owing to the ignorance and carelessness of successive transcribers of the MSS., in many cases almost hopelessly corrupt. The only hope for the restoration of these corrupt passages lies in the positive evidence afforded by inscriptions and coins. The \u015bloka in which the reading Kul\u016bta is to be restored appears thus in the Bombay (1862) edition of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, Bh\u012b\u1e63ma-parvan, Adhy\u0101ya 8, 52:\n\nK\u0101\u015bmir\u0101 Sindhusauv\u012bra G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u0101 Dar\u015bak\u0101s tath\u0101 |\nAbhis\u0101r\u0101\u00b2 Ut\u0101l\u0101\u015bca, Saicel\u0101 B\u0101hlik\u0101s tath\u0101 || 52 ||\n\nWilson (Vi\u1e63\u1e47upur\u0101\u1e47a, ed. Hall, ii, p. 174) reads Ut\u0101l\u0101, and notes also the variants Ul\u0101ta and Kul\u016bta. He adds: \"the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a has Kol\u016bkas or Kaul\u016btas among the Western tribes.\" The identification thus suggested will be discussed below in our examination of the passage of the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a to which Wilson refers. The credit of first seeing that the variants in the passage just quoted from the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata were mistakes for the name Kul\u016bta is due to Dr. Fitz-Edward Hall, who, in his note to Wilson, says: \"The Kul\u016btas\u2014not Kul\u016btas\u2014are a real people; see Wilson's Hindu Theatre, vol. ii, p. 165;\u00b2 M. V. de Saint Martin's M\u00e9moire Analytique sur la carte de l'Asie Centrale, pp. 81\u201384, and his \u00c9tude sur la G\u00e9ographie Grecque, etc., pp. 300\u2013303.\"\n\nIt will be seen that this emendation is abundantly supported\n\n\u00b9 Cf. the mention of H\u016b\u1e47as in the second \u015bloka quoted from this passage of the Mbh. There is no reason to believe that there were H\u016b\u1e47as in India before the reign of Skandagupta, c. 452\u2013480 A.D.\n\u00b2 The first passage quoted from the Mudr\u0101r\u0101k\u1e63asa (infra, p. 535).\nby the fact that the peoples mentioned together with the Kul\u016btas in this \u015bloka also occur with them in other passages of Sanskrit literature.\n\nFarther on in the same passage (\u015bloka 64) we find the mention of a people called Kulatthas, of whom nothing else seems to be known:\n\nYavana\u015b Cina-K\u0101mboja d\u0101ru\u1e47\u0101 Mlechaj\u0101tayah |\nSakya-gr\u0101h\u0101\u1e25 Kulatth\u0101ka H\u016b\u1e47\u0101\u1e25 P\u0101rsikaih saha || 64 ||\n\nThese lists are so thoroughly corrupt that it is doubtful whether scholarship will ever succeed in restoring them to their original state. Conjectural emendation is often very tempting, but it will be safer not to make any corrections except such as are supported by some positive evidence. In the present case, it need only be pointed out how liable two forms such as Kulattha and Kul\u016bta would be to confusion. The possibility of such confusion should be borne in mind when we find the Kul\u016btas in the Mudr\u0101-r\u0101k\u1e63asa (v. inf., p. 535) called Mleechas, and mentioned in association with much the same peoples\u2014Cinas, H\u016b\u1e47as, and P\u0101rsikas (or P\u0101rsikas)\u2014as in this passage. It also suggests a possible explanation of the fact that there are two tribes called Kul\u016bta in the Brhat-samhit\u0101 (v. inf., p. 533).\n\nR\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a.\n\nThe passage of the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, to which Wilson refers, occurs in the Ki\u1e63kindh\u0101-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, xliii, 8 (Bengal recension, ed. Gorresio):\n\nMaricipattanam caiva ramyam ca Jatilasthalam |\nSuciram \u0100\u1e45golokam ca tath\u0101 : Koliukam era ca || 8 ||\n\nWilson\u2019s conjecture that Kul\u016bta should be restored here is probably founded on the variant Kaul\u016bta which he notices. Apart from this, there would seem to be nothing in its favour. The places included in this list are distinctly stated to be in the West. \u0100\u1e45ga is undoubtedly the country around Bhagalpur, in Bengal. Jatilasthala cannot be\nidentified with certainty; but it is not improbably a variant of J\u0101\u1e6dhara, the name of a people who are mentioned together with the \u0100\u1e45gas in the Brhat-samhit\u0101. Of the position of Marici-pattana nothing seems to be known. It is evident, therefore, that the place, the name of which is disguised under the variant forms Kol\u016bka and Kaul\u016bta in this passage of the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, must be sought for in Bengal rather than in the Panjab.\n\nBrhat-samhit\u0101: (Var\u0101ha-mihira, ab. 587 A.D.)\n\nVar\u0101ha-mihira places peoples of this name in two divisions of his astrological chart\u2014(1) the north-west division and (2) the north-east division. In order to distinguish clearly between these two peoples, it will be well to compare the different passages in which they are mentioned.\n\n(1) Kul\u016btas of the north-west division.\n\nxiv.

Kern.\nIt must constantly be borne in mind that there is no certainty as to the reading of many of the names in these lists. A glance at Dr. Kern's various readings will show to what extent the existing MSS. differ from one another. No variants, however, are given of the name Kul\u016bta in either passage. We must suppose, then, either that the readings are correct, or that, if there is a mistake in either case, it is one which goes back to a period before the date of the existing MSS. The two passages are quoted by Alberuni\u00b9 (A.D. 973\u20131048) with variants in the case of many of the names; but here, again, our word Kul\u016bta appears substantially unaltered. It is, of course, sometimes a matter of opinion how words should be divided. In the first passage Kul\u016btalahada is regarded by the Sanskrit editor, Kern, as two words, and by the Arabic editor, Sachau, as one.\n\nWhether there were really two peoples bearing the name Kul\u016bta, or whether, in one case, this form is a wrong reading for some other name, cannot, perhaps, be determined. In glancing through Fleet's Topographical List, one cannot fail to notice that, in several cases, e.g. Abhira, Amba\u1e63\u1e6dha, Bhadra, Ghoja, Kir\u0101\u1e6da, peoples having the same name are placed in two or more divisions. The question is whether this represents an actual state of things, or whether, in some cases, other and perhaps less known names have been altered into these by the copyists. In any case, the Kul\u016btas of the Kullu valley are certainly those of the north-east division mentioned in our second passage.\n\nThese Kul\u016btas must surely, also, be those referred to in x, 11, where they are mentioned together with the Trigarttas and Cinas, and in the next \u015bloka, x, 12, where they are mentioned with Ta\u1e45ganas, Khasas (i.e. Kha\u1e63as), and Ka\u015bmiras. The Kul\u016btas of iv, 22, and xvii, 18, occurring in lists including the Madras, are probably those of the north-west division.\n\n\u00b9 Trans. Sachau (ed. 1888), vol. i, pp. 302, 303.\nMudr\u0101r\u0101ksasa: (Vi\u015b\u0101khadatta, probably c. 600 A.D.)\n\nThis play was formerly held to be not earlier than the eleventh or twelfth century of our era, chiefly on the authority of Wilson, who identified the Mleechas, who play an important part in the story, with the Muhammadans, and supposed the period of its composition to be that during which Muhammadan power was gaining the ascendancy in India. This is, however, an assumption which cannot be sustained. The word Mleechha has various applications. It is used to denote different foreign tribes, such as the H\u016bnas, who invaded India and settled in the northern districts of the Panjab; and it occurs in the Junagadh Inscription of Skandagupta, which is dated in the 138th year of the Gupta era = A.D. 457-8.\u00b9 The period of the plot of the Mudr\u0101r\u0101ksasa is, of course, that of the Maurya Candragupta in the third century B.C.; but there is not the slightest attempt to draw an historical picture, and the conditions of the drama are doubtless those of a period not long anterior to the date of its composition. As Telang has shown, in the excellent Introduction to his edition of the play, a considerable number of indications point rather to the seventh century A.D. as its most probable date. Indeed, if the name Avantiarman which, in some MSS., is substituted for Candragupta in the concluding \u015bloka, refers, as is by no means unlikely, to the Maukhari prince of that name, the date of the play must be within a few years of 600 A.D.\u00b2\n\nThe Kul\u016btas are mentioned in two passages:\n\nAct i, p. 48 (ed. Telang):\n\nC\u0101nakya. \u0100h j\u00f1\u0101tam | Upalabdh\u0101r\u0101n asmi pranidhihhyo yath\u0101 tasya Mleechhar\u0101j\u0101lokasya madhy\u0101t pradh\u0101natamah pa\u00f1ca r\u0101j\u0101nah paray\u0101 sah\u1e5bttaya R\u0101k\u1e63asam anuvarttante | Te yath\u0101 |\n\n\u00b9 Fleet: Corpus Inscrip. Ind., iii, p. 62; Topographical List of the Brhat-samhita, Ind. Ant., 1895, p. 185, n.e. Mleechha; cf. also the ref. given by Telang, Mudr\u0101r\u0101ksasa (Bomb. Skt. Soc.), p. xxviii.\n\n\u00b2 That the Maukharis were great patrons of literature may be inferred from other sources, e.g. from the introductory stanzas to the K\u0101dambari.\nIn the first line of the latter passage, the Calcutta edition has Kir\u0101h instead of Vir\u0101h. This reading is probably to be preferred. The Kiras, as will be seen from other passages, are constantly mentioned together with the Kul\u016btas. Its reading parir\u0101nyad in the second line is also an improvement. On the other hand Cedi- instead of Cina- is an excellent instance of the way in which an unintelligent copyist will constantly substitute a known for an unknown name quite regardless of sense.\n\nThe geographical positions of the tribes mentioned in these two passages are discussed by Telang in his Introduction, pp. xxx ff.\n\nK\u0101dambar\u012b: (B\u0101na, c. 600 A.D.)\n\nProbably no historical importance whatever is to be attached to this passage. It occurs in J\u0101b\u0101li\u2019s story of the previous life of the parrot Vaisamp\u0101yana, and refers to a damsel named Patr\u0101lekha, a daughter of the King of Kul\u016bta, who was taken captive when Kul\u016bta was conquered by the great king (i.e. T\u0101r\u0101pida of Ujjayini), and was sent by the Queen, Vil\u0101savati, to Prince Candr\u0101pida to be his betel-bearer.\nNOTES ON INDIAN COINS AND SEALS.\n\nIyam khalu kanyak\u0101 mah\u0101r\u0101jena p\u016brvam Kul\u016btar\u0101jadh\u0101nim avajitya Kul\u016bte\u015bvaraduhit\u0101 Patralekh\u0101bhidh\u0101n\u0101 b\u0101lik\u0101 sati bandijanena sah\u0101niy\u0101ntahpuraparic\u0101rik\u0101madhyom upani\u1e6d\u0101 |\n\np. 101 (ed.

At this period the dynasties of Canpak\u0101 and Kul\u016bta were related. S\u0101lav\u0101hana, the predecessor of Somavarmadeva and \u0100sat\u0101deva\u2014the \u015a\u0101la of the R\u0101jatarangini who was conquered by Ananta of Kashmir\u2014is described as one \"who was asked the favour of bestowing royalty, in return for services rendered, or to be rendered, by his kinsman, the lord of Kul\u016bta, anxious to render him homage.\" Neighbouring peoples such as the Trigarttas (J\u0101landhara) and K\u012bras, who are elsewhere found in association with the Kul\u016btas, are also mentioned together with them in this inscription, which is thus of the greatest importance as confirming the testimony of the literary documents.\n\nCOIN OF THE KUL\u016aTA KING V\u012aRAYA\u015aA.\n\nThe characters of the Br\u0101hm\u012b inscription on the obverse of this coin are those of columns vii, viii, ix of B\u00fchler's Tafel III, i.e. of the first or second century A.D. Another fact leads us to a similar conclusion. On the reverse we find simply the title ra-\u00f1a in Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b characters. It has been\n\n1) 8: \u015br\u012b - vidhi - vyagra - svakulya - Kul\u016bte\u015bvara(\u015bva)ra - karma-vyati\u015b\u0101ra-pr\u0101rthya\u015b\u0101na-r\u0101jy\u0101tma(p\u0101\u1e47a-pra\u015b\u0101da\u015baya).\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1906.\nnoticed before (J.R.A.S., 1899, p. 372) that on coins bearing inscriptions in the two alphabets the importance of the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi alphabet tends to diminish as time goes on. On the earliest known coins of this class (probably first century B.C.)\u2014e.g. the small silver coins of the Kunindas and Audumbaras\u2014the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi inscription is quite as full as the Br\u0101hm\u012b. At later periods it is first curtailed and then abolished altogether. This process can also, as we have seen, be traced on the coinage of the Western K\u1e63atrapas. We shall probably, therefore, not be far wrong if we attribute this coin to the first or second century A.D.\u2014perhaps rather to the second than the first.\n\nThe Kul\u016btas and their Neighbours.\n\nWe, therefore, find traces of the Kul\u016btas from about the first or second century A.D. to the middle of the eleventh. They are called Mlecchas in the Mudr\u0101r\u0101k\u1e63asa, where they are found in the company of the same tribes as in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a-samhit\u0101 (v. sup. Kul\u016btas of the N.E. Division, p. 533). The term Mlecha meant 'foreigner' generally,\u00b9 and was particularly applied to those foreign invaders who had settled on the northern frontiers.\u00b2 But, whatever may have been the nationality of the Kul\u016btas, they had, as their coin shows, adopted Indian names by the first or second century A.D. So far as we are able to trace the history of foreign invaders in early days, this seems to have been the case regularly. The K\u1e63atrapas of Sur\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra and M\u0101lava begin with foreign (perhaps Persian) names,\u00b3 but rapidly become Hinduized; and the occurrence of the name V\u0101sudeva in the Ku\u1e63\u0101\u1e47a dynasty and of such names as Uday\u0101ditya among the H\u016b\u1e47as points to the same fact. The question whether there were two tribes called Kul\u016bta, as indicated by Var\u0101hamihira, cannot be determined at present. The Kul\u016btas of the Chamba Copper-Plate (v. sup., p. 537), of\n\n\u00b9 E.g. Chinese in Life of Hiuen Thsang, Julien, i, p. 230; Beal, p. 167.\n\u00b2 Id., Julien, i, p. 15. \"Au nord de Lan-pu (Lanchow), les pays fronti\u00e8res portent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement le nom de Mic-li-teh'e (Mitch-teha's).\"\n\u00b3 J.R.A.S., 1899, p. 374.\nHiuen Thsang, of Var\u0101hamihira's N.E. Division, and of the Mudr\u0101r\u0101ksasa are almost certainly, as is shown by the common association of names, the ancient inhabitants of the Kullu Valley. There is no reason to doubt that the coin belongs to the same tribe. Its provenance (Cunningham, Coins of Anc. Ind., p. 67) and the fact that coins of the Ku\u1e47indas, who are mentioned with these Kul\u016btas by Var\u0101hamihira, are found in the same district (ibid.), alike point to this conclusion. As we have seen, the supposed mention of Kul\u016btas in the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a cannot be maintained. With regard to the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, a comparison of the first \u015bloka quoted with the Brhat-samhit\u0101 makes us think that the Kul\u016btas here named must be those of Var\u0101hamihira's N.E. Division. On the other hand, the second \u015bloka, in which we have supposed a possible mistake of Kula\u1e6d\u1e6dhas for Kul\u016btas, has so many names in common with the passages from the Mudr\u0101r\u0101ksasa\u2014Cina, H\u016bpa, P\u0101rsika and 'Mleccha peoples'\u2014that we should feel inclined to come to the same conclusion in this case also. Altogether, we have here a puzzle of which the solution is not yet apparent.\n\nThe constant association of the same names together with the Kul\u016btas may enable us, perhaps, to identify some of these:\n\nCinas (C\u012bpas). This name has often been translated 'Chinese,' and there has been a considerable difference of opinion among scholars whether or not such a translation was admissible. It would seem more reasonable to suppose that the word simply denoted the inhabitants of Cinapati (Chi-na-po-ti), which Hiuen Thsang visited shortly before Kul\u016bta. He derives the name from the fact that king Kaniska had formerly kept some Chinese hostages there (i.e.). As to the present site of Cinapati, Cunningham's identification with Patti seems most probable. In any case, it was certainly not far from Kul\u016bta.\n\n1 Vede the references given by Talang, p. xxxi.\n2 Si.-yu-Ki, Beal, i, p. 173; Julien, ii, p. 199.\n3 Vede, however, Beal, l.c.; Vivien de St. Martin, in Julien, iii, p. 332, identifies it with Kat\u014dch, which seems rather to be Jal\u0101ndhara.\nJ\u0101landhara. From Cinapati, Hiouen Thsang proceeded to J\u0101landhara and thence to Kul\u016bta. With regard to the general identification of J\u0101landhara, or Trigartta as it is also called, with the modern Kangra or Katoch, there seems to be little doubt, though, of course, it must be borne in mind that the extent of these kingdoms probably varied from time to time, and that a name which was at one period applied only to a part may at another period have denoted the whole. The proximity of J\u0101landhara to Kul\u016bta and to other places habitually mentioned in the same lists enables us to suggest another identification.\n\nKir\u0101s. In an inscription dated \u015aaka 7[26], which mentions two rulers of J\u0101landhara, we have a dynastic list of the R\u0101j\u0101nakas of Kiragr\u0101ma. Surely this must be the capital of the Kir\u0101 people, who are so often mentioned together with the Kul\u016btas. As we have seen, the three peoples, Trigarttas, Kiras, and Kul\u016btas, occur together in the Chamba Copper-Plate Inscription (v. sup., p. 537). It is noticeable, moreover, that the Kir\u0101s, who, according to the reading of the Calcutta edition, which is probably correct, are mentioned together with the H\u016b\u1e47as in the second passage quoted from the Mudr\u0101r\u0101k\u1e63asa (sup., p. 536), are also found with them elsewhere.\n\nUdumbaras. From considerations of provenance, Cunningham had classed the coin, which is now proved to have been struck by the Kul\u016bta king Virayasa, among those of the Udumbaras. The fact is interesting as tending to show that the territories of the two peoples were not widely separated. Whether his identification of the name Udumbara with the later Damar\u012b, or Dahmari, can be sustained is not so certain. One is tempted to see some connection with this latter name in the form D\u0101mara, which occurs with Kul\u016bta and the rest among the places comprised in Var\u0101hamihira's N.E. Division (sup., p. 533).\n\n1 Cunningham, op. cit., p. 136.\n2 Kielhorn: List of Inscr. of North. Ind., No. 351; Ep. Ind., i, p. 112.\n3 Kielhorn, Ep. Ind., ii, p. 11.

As has been stated above (p. 530), the Chinese editor of the Si-yu-ki gives San-po-ho as another name for Moloso (possibly Mo-lo-po), and Vivien de St. Martin has no hesitation in identifying it with Canpaka, in spite of the difficulties which have been indicated above. The correspondence in form between the two words is indeed striking; but it must be borne in mind that the Chinese editor, while perfectly right in his intention to transliterate Canpaka by San-po-ho, may have been wrong in his identification of San-po-ho with Mo-lo-so. As usual in these cases, the possibilities of error are numerous, and any special pleading in favour of one or other probability is apt to do more harm than good to the cause which we have at heart\u2014the ascertainment of fact. It must be clearly understood, then, that the following attempt to solve this difficulty is founded on assumptions which remain to be proved or disproved by subsequent discovery\u2014viz., that Hiouen Thsang was wrong as to the information which he gives from hearsay about the locality of Mo-lo-so (Mo-lo-po), that his Chinese editor was right in supposing San-po-ho to be another name for Mo-lo-so (Mo-lo-po), and that San-po-ho is to be identified with Canpaka.\n\nIt is, at any rate, curious that Chamba, by its name Canpaka, is known neither to Var\u0101hamihira nor to Hiouen Thsang. Is it possible that it may have been known to them by another name? The Chinese editor's equation Mo-lo-so (Mo-lo-po) = San-po-ho suggests that the Malaya of our first extract from the Mudr\u0101r\u0101k\u1e63asa may be intended to represent this Mo-lo-so (Mo-lo-po) = San-po-ho. Both Wilson and Telang have been puzzled\u00b9 to find this place-name from distant south-western India thrown in among 'Mleecha' tribes of the extreme northern frontier. Telang hints that Malaya in this passage may be a misreading. This is quite possible. It is simply suggested here that it may be intended to represent\u2014correctly or incorrectly\u2014the Chinese Mo-lo-so (Mo-lo-po) = San-po-ho = Canpaka.\n\n\u00b9 Wilson, Theats of the Hindus, vol. ii, p. 165; Telang, Mudr\u0101r\u0101k\u1e63asa, p. xxiii.\nPerhaps we may venture to go one step farther, although we feel that we are now on very uncertain ground. The exact determination of the territory of the M\u0101lavas is a well-known puzzle in Indian topography. The evidence of coins, associating them with the Yaudheyas and \u0100rjun\u0101yanas, tends to place them somewhere in the north of the Punjab. They are placed by Var\u0101hamihira in the northern division, and in every case but one in which they are mentioned in the Br\u0101h\u0101t-samhit\u0101 they are associated with northern peoples. Mr. Fleet solves this difficulty boldly by saying, \"Var\u0101ha-mihira places them too much to the north; as they are undoubtedly the people of M\u0101lwa, from whom (see Ind. Ant., vol. xx, p. 404) the Vikrama era derived its original appellation.\" But is it not just possible that there may really have been two peoples\u2014(1) the M\u0101lava of the north represented the Ma\u03bb\u03bboi of the Greek writers, by the coins having the inscription M\u0101lav\u0101n\u0101m jaya[h], by the Malaya of the Mudr\u0101r\u0101k\u1e63asa, and by the Mo-lo-so (Mo-lo-po) of Hiouen Thsang; and (2) the better-known M\u0101lava of the south called Mo-lo-po by Hiouen Thsang?\n\nADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.\n\nI was unfortunately unable to see a revise of my first instalment of Notes on Indian Coins and Seals (p. 97), and, in consequence, some misprints and wrong references remain uncorrected.\n\np. 99, lines 12, 25: for opposition read apposition.\np. 100, line 1: for Dajaka read Dojaka.\n\n1 Vide ref. in Fleet, Topographical List.\n2 Ibid.\n3 J.R.A.S., 1900, p. 107.\np. 105, note 1: The reference to the publication of an ancient inscription of Ceylon is wrong in two particulars.

The \u00c1\u015bok\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dami Festival.\n\nGanhati.\nApril 17, 1900.\n\nMy dear Sir,\u2014In my article on \u00c1\u015bwakr\u0101nt\u0101, published in the January number of the Journal, I made reference, on p. 25, to the \u00c1\u015bok\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dami festival. Perhaps it may be of interest to state that the Hindus bathe in the Brahmaputra in Assam, on the eighth day of the bright half of the month of Chaitra, in order to become \u00c1\u015boka, free from sorrow. They also use in performing p\u016bj\u0101 on this occasion the flowers of the \u00c1\u015boka-tree (Jonesia \u00c1soka). The customs of the people therefore leave the original meaning of this curious name for the eighth day of the light half of the lunar month Chaitra in the same uncertainty as it is left in by the dictionaries. Colebrooke had already called attention to the name in 1792 in the \"Asiatic Researches,\" iii, 277.\n\nI may also state for your information that I intend to ask the Kamrup Local Board for a small grant of money to preserve the carving of the Ananta S\u0101jya (reproduced in your Plate II) from destruction by the erection of a small building over the carving.\n\nSince I wrote the article above referred to, the shrine has been honoured by a visit from Her Excellency Lady Curzon of Kedleston, who examined the carving with great interest.\u2014Yours faithfully,\n\nP. R. Gurdon,\nHonorary Director, Ethnography, Assam.\n\nTo Professor Rhys Davids,\nSecretary to the Royal Asiatic Society.\n2. The Etymology of the Name B\u0101bar.\n\nB\u0101bar appears to be a lengthened form of the word \n\u092c\u093e\u092c\u0930, babar or bibar, and is commonly explained as meaning \n'tiger.' In our Persian and Hindustani dictionaries the \nword \u092c\u093e\u092c\u0930 is rendered both as 'lion' and as 'tiger'; while \nLans, in his Arabic dictionary, gives as one explanation of \nthe word, \"a certain Indian animal, stronger than the lion, \nbetween which and the lion and leopard, or panther, exists \nhostility.\" He also says that the word is foreign, or \nPersian. The word occurs several times in Jahangir's \nMemoirs, and in one place, B.M. MS. Add. 26,215, p. 245a, \nhe distinguishes it from the \u0936\u0947\u0930, sher or tiger, and speaks \nof having had both these dissected in order to find the cause \nof their courage. It seems to me that he understood the \nword as meaning 'leopard,' and as he speaks on more than \none occasion of having despatched the babar by a single \nshot, it probably was a smaller animal than the tiger. In \none place in Afghanistan, either B\u0101bar's tomb or the entrance \nof the inscription-nave described by Darmesteter, two leopards \nare sculptured, which seems to show that Babar was supposed \nto mean 'leopard.' In Zend the word is bawri, and in \nHalkin's Cyclopaedia and Jardou's \"Mammals of India,\" \np. 90, the form bibbi is given. Is not, then, the word the \nsame as the Greek \u0392\u03ac\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, which appears in Latin as \nvarius, and means 'the spotted'? In Anglo-Indian slang \nthe leopard and the tiger are commonly distinguished as \n\"spots and stripes.\" The word may also be connected with \nthe Greek \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 or paradisi.\n\nH. BEVERIDGE.\n\nMay 3, 1900.\n\n3. Pahlavi Words, Derivation and Significance.\n\nBombay.\nMay 3, 1900.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014With reference to the Pahlavi words abd\u0101man \n(abad) and abd\u0101man (abad) as they are used in passages such \nas the following, I submit for the criticism of the members\nof the Royal Asiatic Society a brief note suggestive of their special significations in the respective quotations given below.\n\nThese Pahlavi passages, which occur in (1) *Y\u0101dg\u0101r-i-Zartr\u0101n*, \u00a7 65, and in (2) *Ax\u014dd\u0101-i-Vird\u0101*, chap. ii, \u00a7\u00a7 1\u20132, run thus:\n\n(1) \"Va \u0101khar yemalelunid Kai-Visht\u0101sp-Shah aigh hat ham\u0101k bend va akh va vispuhrag\u0101n i li, Kai-Visht\u0101sp-Shah, va zakieh i H\u016bt\u014ds, zyam akht\u0101 va nish\u0101, m\u016bn min bend va bent\u0101 30 azash z\u0101d yekavim\u0101n\u0113d, ham\u0101k yemil\u016bnt yehev\u016bnd; adinam den\u0101 avizak Din i M\u0101zdaiasn\u0101n chig\u016bnam min A\u016bharmazd mekab\u012bl\u016bnt bar\u0101 l\u0101 shedk\u016bnam.\"\n\n(2) \"Va old\u0101 Vird\u0101 r\u0101t 7 akht\u0101 yehev\u016bnd, va oldsh\u0101n k\u014dl\u0101 7 akht\u0101n Vird\u0101 chig\u016bn nish\u0101 yehev\u016bnt h\u016bmand.\"\n\nThe translators hitherto of these citations have, in their interpretations, attached to the two words *akht\u0101* and *nish\u0101* the ordinary meanings of 'sister' and 'wife' in which they are generally used in Pahlavi. But I believe that these two words have distinct readings and significations in the texts above-mentioned. The decipherment in the first case is not *zyam akht\u0101 va nish\u0101*, \"who is my sister and wife,\" but *zyam khajid m\u016bn nish\u0101*. Here the two words *khajid* and *m\u016bn* are joined together in the original text by an ignorant copyist to form the commonly known word *akhtman*, which means 'sister.'\n\nIn the first passage the word *akhtman* in the text is properly *khajid* plus *m\u016bn* (the latter can also be read *man*, a pronoun sometimes used in Pahlavi as the Pazend synonym of the Huzvaresh *li*).\n\nThe word *khajid* is derived from the Avesta *hea*, 'self' (Skt. *sva*), and *chi* (Skt. *ch\u012b*), 'to choose.' Literally, it means 'chosen by one's self.' It is identical with the modern Persian *kh\u0101zdan* or *kh\u016bzdan*, which signifies 'to invite to marriage' or 'to solicit for the hand of a maiden.'\n\nHence my version of the Pahlavi text (1) is:\n\n---\n\n1 See under the word, Maulawi Fazl-i-Ali's Dictionary, p. 237.\n\"And afterwards the king Kai-Visht\u0101sp spoke thus:\u2014\n'If all the sons, and brothers, and princes of mine, (who am) Kai Visht\u0101sp Shah, and of H\u016bt\u014ds, who was chosen by myself (to be my spouse), (and) who (was married to me and) is my wife, and by whom are begotten 30, including sons and daughters; (if they) are to die together, then (too) I shall not forsake this sacred Mazdayasian Revelation such as I have accepted from Auharmazd.'\"\n\nThe Pahlavi expression zyam khajid suggests to us that the courting or solicitation for the hand of a maiden was not unknown to the Iranians in the age of the Avesta. The failure of such a solicitation does not seem to have been uncommon, as the highest power, like King Visht\u0101sp, emphatically expresses the successful result of his courtship in his subsequent connubial union with H\u016bt\u014ds.\n\nIn the second Pahlavi passage quoted above, the word nist\u0101 is not used in its ordinary import of 'wife' or 'woman,' but it seems to be, as in other Pahlavi MSS., an erroneous reading of the original nism\u014d or nisman, which means 'soul,' 'life,' 'vital power,' etc. (cf. S.B.E., vol. xxxvii, chap. xiv, \u00a7 1). This much discussed passage can therefore be rendered: \"Vir\u0101d had seven sisters, and all these seven were unto Vir\u0101d as dear as (his) soul.\"\n\nA further progress in the decipherment and interpretation of more Pahlavi texts will, I hope, enable us to throw better light on such ambiguous and obscure Pahlavi words and expressions.\u2014Yours sincerely,\n\nDarab Dastur Peshotan Sanjana.\n\n4. Santak or Sign-Signatures in India.\n\nSir,\u2014Perhaps some of the readers of your Journal may kindly help me to obtain further information as to the origin of the santaks or marks used to attest the signatures of illiterate persons in some parts of India, and as to the use of similar marks in other countries.\nIn the Orissa districts of Bengal every man has according to his caste and family a distinctive mark, which, if unable to sign his name, he is supposed to draw, and may generally use as a crest. In most cases these marks are rude or conventional drawings of an implement used by members of a profession: for instance, a Bhand\u0101ri or member of the caste of barbers makes a square which is called the darpan santak or looking-glass sign; a Khandait or member of the old warrior caste uses a khand\u0101 santak or sword sign; and a goldsmith makes a simple circle supposed to represent a touchstone. Many castes use more than one mark, and custom appears to determine which of them is used in any particular family. The most general mark is the figure of Jaganath which any Hindu may use, and the most exclusive is the peacock confined to descendants of the old royal family of the peacock line. To illustrate the use of the santak, we may suppose that Fagu Pahar\u0101j, an illiterate Brahman, asks R\u00e1m Mahanti to sign a paper for him. R\u00e1m Mahanti would write \"e ku\u1e63abatu santak likhi\u1e6dan Fagu Pahar\u0101j,\" i.e., this symbol of the ring of kusa-grass was made by Fagu Pahar\u0101j, and would probably add the words \"by the agency of R\u00e1m Mahanti.\" Whether this addition was made or not the form of signature would show that Fagu Pahar\u0101j was a Brahman, and that he could not or did not sign his own name, the mark only being, in theory, made by him. I have made a collection, by no means complete, of such marks, and I shall be greatly obliged for information as to the existing literature on the subject, and as to the prevalence of similar customs elsewhere.\n\nJ. E. Webster, I.C.S.\n\nTo Professor Rhys Davids.\n5. THE T\u0100RIKH AL HUKAM\u0100 OF MUHAMMAD SHAHRIST\u0100N\u012a.\n\nSir,\u2014Dr. Cureton states in the preface to his edition of Shahrist\u0101n\u012b's Book of Sects (London, O.T.F., 1846), p. ii, note e, that there were two copies of Shahrist\u0101n\u012b's T\u0101rikh al Hukam\u0101, or Lives of Philosophers, in Mr. Bland's library, though one appeared to have been transcribed from the other. He also said that he had seen a Persian translation of the work. This had been brought to England by Mr. Fraser, but it was afterwards bought by the Prince of Oude and taken back to India.\n\nMr. Bland's manuscripts were bought by the Earl of Crawford in 1866 through Mr. Quaritch, and now form part of the Bibliotheca Lindesiana at Haigh Hall, Wigan. In the privately printed hand-list of that collection (1898), p. 90, No. 36, there is an entry of Shahrist\u0101n\u012b's work, and Mr. Edmond, the Librarian at Haigh Hall, has kindly sent it to me at the British Museum. There Mr. Ellis has been good enough to examine it, and he has found it to be identical with the anonymous work described by Dr. Rieu at p. 601b of the Arabic Catalogue, and which Dr. Rieu considers to be the work, not of Shahrist\u0101n\u012b, but of Shamsu-d-din Shahrz\u016br\u012b. The B.M. copy and the Bib. Lind. copy have exactly the same style of binding, and there can be no doubt that both originally belonged to Mr. Bland, and that they are the two copies described by Dr. Cureton. The contents of both are the same, and the B.M. copy, which is the older of the two, is evidently the one from which the copy now in the Bib. Lind. was transcribed. The British Museum copy, it appears, was purchased by the authorities from Dr. Cureton's executors.\n\nThough the Arabic MSS. of the T\u0101rikh al Hukam\u0101 do not give the author's name, the Persian translation (Rieu's Persian Catalogue, Supplement, p. 68c, No. 100, I) states the author's name as Shahrz\u016br\u012b; and the work cannot be by Shahrast\u0101n\u012b, for it contains the biography of Sahrawardi,\n\n1 I am indebted to Mr. Whinfield for the reference.\nwho was put to death in 587 A.H., whereas Shahrist\u0101n\u012b died in 548 A.H.\n\nWhen I was in India I made many inquiries about Shahrist\u0101n\u012b\u2019s work, but failed to find it, though Shahraz\u016br\u012b\u2019s was not uncommon.\n\nThe probability is that Shahrist\u0101n\u012b never wrote \u201cLives of Philosophers,\u201d and that the mistake originated with H\u0101ji Khal\u012bfa, who mixed up the two names Shahrist\u0101n\u012b and Shahraz\u016br\u012b. In his reference to the former (Fluegel, ii, p. 125) he gives no details, which seems to imply that he had never seen the book, whereas in his account of Shahraz\u016br\u012b\u2019s work (Fluegel, vi, 321) he describes the contents and gives the exordium.\n\nH. BEVERIDGE.\n\nJune 7, 1900.\n\n6. Akkadian and Sumerian.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014Probably I was wrong in making such a loose translation of Akkad\u0101 and \u1e62u[mer\u0101?] in my paper \u201cSumerian or Cryptography\u201d in the January Part of the Journal (p. 94). Instead of Akkad and Sumer, I ought to have said \u201cthe Akkadian\u201d and \u201cthe Sumerian.\u201d\n\nI was thinking of the passage in K. 2,619, where we have Elam\u0101 Elam\u016b, Ka\u0161\u0161a Ka\u0161\u0161u, Sut\u0101 Sut\u016b, Qut\u0101 Qut\u016b, Lullub\u0101 Lullub\u016b (accusative and nominative), and Akkad\u016b (nom.), all occurring with the meanings of Elamite, Kassite, Sute, Qute, Lullabite, and Akkadian, each of these adjectives standing for the nation it represents, though there is no prefix for country.\n\nAkkad\u0101 means, therefore, \u2018Akkadian,\u2019 and is to all appearance accusative. But did somebody \u201cplace the Akkadian\u201d above, or did he \u201cwrite Akkadian\u201d above? I have said in my paper that this fragment of an inscription (K. 14,013) \u201craises the question whether the position of the two districts is referred to.\u201d Few, in all probability, will say that this phrase requires amending, for this question would in any case still remain.\nThat Akkada and \u0160u[mera] may refer to the languages is not only possible, but probable. That the position of the writing on the tablet is referred to, however, one may be allowed to doubt. Supposing that the upper line were Akkadian and the lower line Sumerian, a man who could read would know this without being told, and to one who could not read such information would be useless.\n\nPerhaps K. 14,013 is a parallel text to K. 11,856, where, after references to \u1d48\u2083\u2084\u2085\u2086\u2087\u2088\u2089\u2081\u2080\u2081\u2081\u2081\u2082\u2081\u2083\u2081\u2084\u2081\u2085\u2081\u2086\u2081\u2087\u2081\u2088\u2081\u2089\u2082\u2080\u2082\u2081\u2082\u2082\u2082\u2083\u2082\u2084\u2082\u2085\u2082\u2086\u2082\u2087\u2082\u2088\u2082\u2089\u2083\u2080\u2083\u2081\u2083\u2082\u2083\u2083\u2083\u2084\u2083\u2085\u2083\u2086\u2083\u2087\u2083\u2088\u2083\u20b9\u2084\u2080\u2084\u2081\u2084\u2082\u2084\u2083\u2084\u2084\u2084\u2085\u2084\u20b6\u2084\u20b7\u2084\u20b8\u2084\u20b9\u2085\u2080\u2085\u2081\u2085\u2082\u2085\u2083\u2085\u2084\u2085\u2085\u2085\u2086\u2085\u20b7\u2085\u20b8\u2085\u20b9\u2086\u2080\u2086\u2081\u2086\u2082\u2086\u2083\u2086\u2084\u2086\u20b5\u2086\u20b7\u2086\u20b8\u2086\u20b9\u2087\u2080\u2087\u2081\u2087\u2082\u2087\u2083\u2087\u2084\u2087\u20b5\u2087\u20b7\u2087\u20b8\u2087\u20b9\u2088\u2080\u2088\u2081\u2088\u2082\u2088\u2083\u2088\u2084\u2088\u20b5\u2088\u20b7\u2088\u20b8\u2088\u20b9\u2089\u2080\u2089\u2081\u2089\u2082\u2089\u2083\u2089\u2084\u2089\u20b5\u2089\u20b7\u2089\u20b8\u2089\u20b9\u2081\u2080\u2080\u2081\u2080\u2081\u2081\u2080\u2082\u2081\u2080\u2083\u2081\u2080\u2084\u2081\u2080\u20b5\u2081\u2080\u20b7\u2081\u2080\u20b8\u2081\u2080\u20b9\u2081\u2081\u2080\u2081\u2081\u2081\u2081\u2081\u2082\u2081\u2081\u2083\u2081\u2081\u2084\u2081\u2081\u20b5\u2081\u2081\u20b7\u2081\u2081\u20b8\u2081\u2081\u20b9\u2081\u2082\u2080\u2081\u2082\u2081\u2081\u2082\u2082\u2081\u2082\u2083\u2081\u2082\u2084\u2081\u2082\u20b5\u2081\u2082\u20b7\u2081\u2082\u20b8\u2081\u2082\u20b9\u2081\u2083\u2080\u2081\u2083\u2081\u2081\u2083\u2082\u2081\u2083\u2083\u2081\u2083\u20b4\u2081\u2083\u20b7\u2081\u2083\u20b8\u2081\u2083\u20b9\u2081\u2084\u2080\u2081\u2084\u2081\u2081\u2084\u2082\u2081\u2084\u2083\u2081\u2084\u20b4\u2081\u2084\u20b7\u2081\u2084\u20b8\u2081\u2084\u20b9\u2081\u2085\u2080\u2081\u2085\u2081\u2081\u2085\u2082\u2081\u2085\u2083\u2081\u2085\u20b4\u2081\u2085\u20b7\u2081\u2085\u20b8\u2081\u2085\u20b9\u2081\u2086\u2080\u2081\u2086\u2081\u2081\u2086\u2082\u2081\u2086\u2083\u2081\u2086\u20b4\u2081\u2086\u20b7\u2081\u2086\u20b8\u2081\u2086\u20b9\u2081\u2087\u2080\u2081\u2087\u2081\u2081\u2087\u2082\u2081\u2087\u2083\u2081\u2087\u20b4\u2081\u2087\u20b7\u2081\u2087\u20b8\u2081\u2087\u20b9\u2081\u2088\u2080\u2081\u2088\u2081\u2081\u2088\u2082\u2081\u2088\u2083\u2081\u2088\u20b4\u2081\u2088\u20b7\u2081\u2088\u20b8\u2081\u2088\u20b9\u2081\u2089\u2080\u2081\u2089\u2081\u2081\u2089\u2082\u2081\u2089\u2083\u2081\u2089\u20b4\u2081\u2089\u20b7\u2081\u2089\u20b8\u2081\u2089\u20b9\u2082\u2080\u2080\u2081\u2082\u2080\u2081\u2082\u2081\u2082\u2080\u2082\u2081\u2082\u2083\u2081\u2082\u2084\u2081\u2082\u20b5\u2081\u2082\u20b7\u2081\u2082\u20b8\u2081\u2082\u20b9\u2081\u2083\u2080\u2081\u2083\u2081\u2081\u2083\u2082\u2081\u2083\u2083\u2081\u2083\u20b4\u2081\u2083\u20b7\u2081\u2083\u20b8\u2081\u2083\u20b9\u2081\u2084\u2080\u2081\u2084\u2081\u2081\u2084\u2082\u2081\u2084\u2083\u2081\u2084\u20b4\u2081\u2084\u20b7\u2081\u2084\u20b8\u2081\u2084\u20b9\u2081\u2085\u2080\u2081\u2085\u2081\u2081\u2085\u2082\u2081\u2085\u2083\u2081\u2085\u20b4\u2081\u2085\u20b7\u2081\u2085\u20b8\u2081\u2085\u20b9\u2081\u2086\u2080\u2081\u2086\u2081\u2081\u2086\u2082\u2081\u2086\u2083\u2081\u2086\u20b4\u2081\u2086\u20b7\u2081\u2086\u20b8\u2081\u2086\u20b9\u2081\u2087\u2080\u2081\u2087\u2081\u2081\u2087\u2082\u2081\u2087\u2083\u2081\u2087\u20b4\u2081\u2087\u20b7\u2081\u2087\u20b8\u2081\u2087\u20b9\u2081\u2088\u2080\u2081\u2088\u2081\u2081\u2088\u2082\u2081\u2088\u2083\u2081\u2088\u20b4\u2081\u2088\u20b7\u2081\u2088\u20b8\u2081\u2088\u20b9\u2081\u2089\u2080\u2081\u2089\u2081\u2081\u2089\u2082\u2081\u2089\u2083\u2081\u2089\u20b4\u2081\u2089\u20b7\u2081\u2089\u20b8\u2081\u2089\u20b9\u2082\u2080\u2080\u2081\n\nBut this, like the others, is tantalizingly incomplete.\n\nI am glad to have Professor Tiele's criticism, as it proves that my language, notwithstanding my desire to be cautious, was not sufficiently guarded and precise.\n\nTheophilus G.

Note on Indian Coins and Inscriptions.\n\nNaini Tal, N.W.P.\nMay 28, 1900.\n\nDear Professor Rhys Davids,\u2014At pp. 115 and 116 of the Journal for January, 1900, Mr. Rapson discusses the coins of Virasena and refers to the question whether they should be classed with the so-called Muttra coins. There cannot be the slightest doubt that they are found most commonly in the places where the Muttra coins are found, but they are also found further to the west and south. Most of my Muttra coins I have ten of those figured in plate viii, Cunningham's \"Coins of Ancient India,\" besides a number\nI am still working at) were found on the ancient site of Sankisa or the neighbouring village of Sarai Aghat, the former in the Farukhabad district and the latter in Etah. I have never, however, got a Muttra coin in Qanauj, though I have obtained several of Virasena there. A more important fact, however, is the inscription I found in the south of the Farukhabad district at J\u0101nkhat, a village five miles southwest by south of Thatia, and nine miles south-east of Tirwa, in the Tirwa tahsil (the place is marked on the map in the Gazetteer of the Farukhabad district). As is usual in these parts, every carved stone found is placed on a mound in or near the village site, and the collection is called the Gaur\u0101 deci, or village gods. When in camp I always examined these, and on January 21st, 1896, as I was leaving the village I found an inscription on the back of one stone, the front of which had a carving, the nature of which I forget. I had no materials for taking an extampage and at that time did not know the Brahmi letters, but took two eye-copies. From a volume of Cunningham's Archaeological Reports I made out the name Virasena written exactly as it is on the coins, and a few months later Mr. V. A. Smith, as soon as he saw the copy, read the date 113 Grishma. Looking at the copy again, I am inclined to think that between the word Virasena and the date the word Samvatsara occurs, and the symbol read by Mr. Smith as 100 is really the final -ra of Samvatsara. This would make the date 13 of the Samvat era, or B.C. 45. I attempted to get the stone sent to the Lucknow Museum, but the owner of the village, a man much under the influence of the Brahmans, wrote that the villagers refused to let it go, and I had left the district before I realized the importance of the find. Dr. F\u00fchrer promised to send a man to take a cast or extampage, but apparently omitted to do so. If possible I shall go there next cold weather, but it is uncertain whether I can get there, as the place is some distance from the railway. The middle of the lower part of the stone has lost the inscription, and the appearance led me to believe it had been used to sharpen chisels on.\n\nJ.B.A.S. 1900.\nOn p. 110 of the same number Mr. Rapson publishes a Muttra coin with a new name, \u015aesad\u0101tasa, and writes that only three specimens are known. Three years ago I sent a specimen, which I still possess, to the Bengal Asiatic Society for publication. The Society could not allow a plate for my paper, which was therefore not published, and at that time I thought the symbol for \u015ae- was a combination of ta- and ra-. There is no doubt, however, to my mind, that Mr. Rapson's reading of \u015ae\u1e63a is correct. The letter immediately before \u015ae on my coin is blurred, but appears to be the combination j\u012bv\u014d as in No. 10 of Mr. Rapson's paper. The top of the -da- is gone, so that it is impossible to say whether it has the long -\u0101- attached to it or not.\n\nI should also like to mention that my specimen of Brahma Mitra (Cunn., Coins of Anc. Ind., pl. viii, No. 12) is either of mixed metal or was washed with silver, and I have one round coin of Virasena.\u2014Yours sincerely,\n\nRichard Burn.\n\n8. Sanskrit Deed of Sale.\n\nG\u00f6ttingen.\nJune 17, 1900.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014In his interesting article on \"A Sanskrit Deed of Sale concerning a Kashmirian Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata Manuscript,\" Dr. Stein, above p. 191, has stated that the date of that deed corresponds to Thursday, the 10th July, 1682; but the 10th July, 1682, old style, was a Monday, and new style, a Friday. Really the original date, \"Thursday, the 1st\\(^1\\) of the dark half of \u0100\u015bvina of the laukika year 58 [i.e. the Saptar\u1e63i year 4758],\" corresponds to Thursday, the 7th September, 1682, old style.\u2014Yours truly,\n\nF. Kielhorn.\n\n\\(^1\\) On p. 191, line 3, Dr. Stein has \"the 8th day,\" but from pp. 188 and 189 it is clear that the day was the 1st.\nNOTICES OF BOOKS.\n\nJALKUT MACHIRI, SAMMLUNG HALACHISCHER UND HAGGADISCHER STELLEN AUS TALMUD UND MIDRASCHIM ZU DEN 150 PSALMEN, VON R. MACHIR BEN ABBA MARI. ZUM ERSTEN MALE HERAUSGEGEBEN, etc., VON SALOMON BUBER. 2 VOLS. PP. XVIII, 354, 296. (BERDYCEW, 1899.)\n\nThe full history of Biblical Catenae has still to be written. Homiletical interpretations of portions of the Bible are known in great numbers, and the best editions of the smaller books are due to the industry and the critical learning of Mr. Buber. He has been the first to place the editions of such works upon the basis of modern criticism, and to furnish the student with absolutely reliable texts. To him more than to any other man this branch of ancient Hebrew literature owes almost everything of value. He has now turned also to the edition of what I have called the Hebrew \"Catenae.\" It is not the place here to enter into any details as to the probable origin of this kind of collections, in which all the previous works have been utilized, in the same manner as we find the homiletical works of the Fathers of the Church and of other great scholars used in the mediaeval Christian compilations which go under this very name of Catenae. To each verse of the Bible a number of interpretations is given culled from those writings and strung together on the thread of the biblical text, forming thus a kind of \"Chain\" of interpretation. I have dealt largely with similar compilations in Hebrew\ntime when and the place where our author lived, and the relation in which his Jalqut stands to another more popular compilation also known by the same name, which had been the cause of his disappearance, as it was more complete and richer in haggadic quotation. Mr. Buber controverts some of the views expressed by me on this question, which I still consider as open; he himself does not come to any definite conclusion. An index of the sources quoted in the work increases its practical value for critical purposes. All scholars interested in this branch of literature will gratefully accept the new gift offered to them by the veteran savant, and will still more appreciate it, considering that it is issued at so low a price as 5s. 6d. for both volumes well printed.\n\nIn conclusion, I may remark that I am now preparing the edition of the British Museum MS. Catena on the Minor Prophets, and will thus complete the edition of Machir's \"Yalqut,\" in which I have taken a special interest for many years.\n\nM. G.\n\nThe Dhammapada. Second edition, by V. Fausboll. 8vo; pp. 94. (London: Luzac & Co., 1900.)\n\nThis is the first Pali text to be issued in a second edition, and the fact that a second edition is not only possible, but is urgently wanted, shows that Pali studies have entered upon a new stage in their forward progress. How great has that progress been since, now nearly fifty years ago, this book was first brought out! Then the Pali scholars in Europe could be counted on the fingers of one hand, and there were none at all in America. Now there is scarcely a Sanskrit professor in Europe or America who does not read Pali; and many of them have contributed to the solution of the historical questions raised by the publication of the Pali texts. That curious attitude of mixed contempt and dislike (born from exclusive familiarity with the priestly\nview of things Indian, which used to be taken up by some Sanskritists, has now nearly passed away. It is taken for granted that a successful solution of the current problems in the evolution of Indian religion, philosophy, social institutions, laws, and customs can only be expected when all available evidence, including that preserved in the Prakrit books, shall have been duly considered. And everyone knows how very large and important a part of such evidence now available to Indologists has been made accessible to them by our distinguished honorary member, the editor of this volume.\n\nIt is chiefly two ways in which this edition differs from the first. In the first place, whereas the MSS., and the native editions, always spell the words according to the plan afterwards systematically laid down for the spelling of Pali, many of the verses included in this anthology were evidently (as one can see from the metre) originally pronounced otherwise. No doubt the verses were put together at different times and in different places. It is not necessary therefore to endeavour to make them all conform to the same fashion of speech. But where the metre clearly shows that the author pronounced, and would have written, *kilesa* for *kilesa*, *arya* for *ariya*, *cetiya* for *cetiya*, and so on, the present edition has been printed accordingly.\n\nThis is the first systematic attempt in the editing of a Pali text to get behind the MSS. and the commentaries, and restore a more ancient reading. It will be received, there can be little doubt, with favour, and be widely followed. Hitherto this has been scarcely possible. But now that we have so many Pali texts before us, of all ages, and from all the countries where it was the literary language, we can begin to distinguish with a reasonable degree of certainty between the usages of different times and places; and can hope to be able to reconstruct the most ancient form of it.\n\nAs time goes on we shall assuredly be able also to get behind our MSS. on other details, on modes of expression, for instance, relating to doctrine, especially as to the person\nof the Buddha himself. For though it is increasingly certain, as our knowledge grows wider, that the Pali canon contains our oldest authorities, it is also certain that they, too, had an evolution. The works included in the Canon are admittedly of different ages, though all of them, with one possible exception, were composed in the North of India. In the process of that evolution they will have been subject, within certain limits, to change, and it is not too much to hope that we may be able before long to define those limits.\n\nThe other innovation is the pointing out of the passages from which the verses in this anthology have been taken, so far as has been ascertained since the first edition was published. The editor has traced 131 out of the 423 verses to earlier Buddhist books, and has pointed out parallels to 50 others found in later Indian literature\u2014the Mah\u0101 Bh\u0101rata, for instance, and Manu, besides the later Buddhist works. These parallels are not always very close, and in several cases amount to little more than similarity of idea. The editor might have enlarged this list.

In those cases, however, in which the verses recur in later Buddhist works, either Pali or Sanskrit, it is not probable that they were taken from this anthology. It is more likely they were taken from the sources from which the Dhammapada itself drew.\n\nWhere the verses occur, either in whole or in part, in brahmin books, we may be sure they are not borrowed either from any Buddhist anthology or from the sources thereof. In this case the verses are never Buddhist. They simply set out in rhyme some worldly moral maxim. They may have been, like so many proverbs, common property to all Indians, before the Buddhists adapted them; or occasionally perhaps a maxim, first thrown into verse by some Kshatriya or Buddhist, received sufficiently wide acceptance to become common property, and was then adopted by brahmin writers. In such verses a word or two is sometimes changed, and it would make an interesting article to point out the changes, some of which are very suggestive, and discuss the reasons for them.\n\nWe congratulate Professor Faub\u00f6ll on the great care and thoroughness with which this present work has been done; and would venture to suggest to him that a similar second edition of his Sutta Nip\u0101ta is very much wanted by all interested in Pali studies.\nNOTICES OF BOOKS.\n\nTHE Upanishads. Vols. II, III, and IV. pp. 193, 311, and 374. (Madras: Natesan & Co., 1898, 1899.)\n\nThis is the continuation of the translation into English of \u015aankara's commentaries on the old Upanishads, of which the first volume was noticed above, J.R.A.S., 1899, p. 145. The second volume contains the Ka\u1e6dha and Pra\u015bna, and the third and fourth volumes contain the Ch\u0101ndogya. There are still no indices of any kind, and no references to the pages of the text of the commentary. If the publisher will provide at the end of the series a full index of subjects treated, and another of the Sanskrit words discussed and explained by \u015aankara, the series would become a valuable work of reference, and would find a place on the shelves of every student of Indian thought. We would once more urge Mr. Sesbacharri to take this matter into serious consideration.\n\nGEORGISCHE DICHTER, \u00fcbersetzt von ARTHUR LEIST.\n(Dresden: E. Pierson.) M. G. JANASHVILI, TSARITSA TAMARA (in Russian). (Tiflis: M. Shavadze.)\n\nA few travellers\u2014notably Mr. James Bryce\u2014have written about the Georgians, but their picturesque country has been but little visited by Englishmen. It is, however, one of the most charming regions upon the face of the earth, and well deserves the praises which Herr Arthur Leist has bestowed upon it in the work at present under our notice. The inhabitants are a fine manly race, worthy of such a land. Of the language and literature of this people almost nothing is known in England, but there are indications that we shall be soon made more familiar with it. Mr. Oliver Wardrop, now Vice-Consul at Kertch, has given us a translation of a notable book among the Georgians, the so-called \"Book of Wisdom and Lies,\" by Sulkhan Orbeliani; and his sister, Miss Marjory Wardrop, has not only published a translation of some Mingrelian tales, but promises us a version of \"The Man in the Tiger's Skin,\" the national epic.\nBut we must not keep Herr Leist any longer waiting; he has indeed done yeoman service in the cause of Georgian literature, and we may add Armenian (\"Armenische Dichter,\" Dresden, 1898). The first edition of the present work was published in 1887; in 1889 appeared from the pen of our author a version of the epic of Shota Rustaveli (\"Der Mann im Tigerfelle,\" Dresden); and he now issues a second edition of his anthology with many new pieces, and a very useful summary of Georgian literature in the Introduction. The Georgian language is still a veritable crux for the philologist, and Professor Schuchardt, of Gratz, has recently taken it in hand and essayed to explain its perplexing verbal system, which reminds us very much of Basque, although the two languages have no words of their vocabulary in common. It has two alphabets, one called the ecclesiastical and the other the military. At present we only know from the labours of Brosset, Tsagarelli, Erckert, and others, that there are four languages which greatly resemble each other: Georgian, Mingrelian, Lazi, and Suan. These four are unlike all other languages as far as linguistic classification has been conducted. Georgian is the only one which boasts any literature; the others have songs and folk-tales merely. After long contests with their Mohammedan neighbours the Georgians were annexed by Russia at the beginning of the present century. Their literature goes back to the eighth century, but the great period\u2014the Bl\u00fcthezeit, as the Germans would term it\u2014was in the thirteenth century, in the reign of Queen Tamara, the great sovereign to whom everything glorious in the national history is assigned. Mr. Janashvili has written her life in Russian. In most of the early Georgian literature a Persian influence can be traced. But the reader who wishes to know about their authors must be referred to Herr Leist's excellent Introduction, where a great deal of information is conveyed in a very compact form. For his extracts in the present volume Herr Leist deals only with the poets of the present century\u2014in fact, those who have flourished during the new period of the country under Russian influence and that\nof the West generally. He begins with Gregory Orbeliani, who died in 1883 at an advanced age. The poems strike us as full of colour. In the present volume they are all lyrical. Love and wine are frequent topics. With these patriotism is intermixed, as in the lines (p. 23) on the death of Heraklius II, the last native king of Georgia.\n\nWe ought to add that short biographical notices of the poets are prefixed to the selections from their works. Perhaps the most conspicuous of the modern Georgian poets is Prince Elias Chavchavadze, who received his education at St. Petersburg. He is one of the most conspicuous citizens of Tiflis, where he dispenses a generous hospitality. He is also editor of the journal Iveria, the columns of which frequently contain valuable data on the folklore and traditions of the Georgian tribes. The \"Hermit,\" by Prince Chavchavadze, has been translated into Russian; and there is an English version by Miss M. Wardrop, which, we believe, was the first translation of a Georgian poem which has appeared in our language. The feelings of a genuine patriot are expressed in his lines \"On the Banks of the Kur\" (p. 59 in Herr Leist's translation):\n\n\"So h\u00f6r' ich wieder dein vergessenes Rauschen\nO Heimatstrom und aufgewacht vom Schlummer\nRegt meine Seele wieder banger Kummer\nDenn nur betr\u00fcbt mag deinem Spiel ich lauschen.\"\n\nIn the present volume they are rendered most musically. After dealing with several others of the modern poets, Herr Leist winds up with some Volkslieder, among which the Grabschrift der K\u00f6nigin Tamar is very striking. The aphorisms from Shota Rustaveli will be read with pleasure, and will tempt the reader to be further acquainted with the curious poem from which they are selected. He would do well to make himself familiar with Herr Leist's translation of the Vepkhweis-Tqaozani, in which he has used a judicious system of compression. Altogether, we can certainly promise the Western reader considerable pleasure from Herr Leist's volume. A terra incognita will be open\nto him; the picturesque scenery and equally picturesque inhabitants of delightful Georgia come back again to us as we open his pages, and the pretty little illustrations with which this dainty book is published increase its poetic charm. But it is not in poetry only that modern Georgians have distinguished themselves. There are many excellent contributions to history and ethnology. Unfortunately, however, these are either in the Georgian or Russian languages, and therefore not easily available to an English philologist. Among these must be mentioned the elaborate history of Georgian Literature by Professor Khakhanov, now appearing in Russian, and the valuable papers on the same subject by Professor Marr in the Journal of the Minister of Public Instruction.\n\nIn the year 1873 Demetrius Bakradze, a Georgian antiquarian, called the attention of his countrymen to the great destruction of antiquities going on in this ancient and picturesque country. He stirred his fellow-citizens with such zeal that a Museum was finally founded for their preservation. This institution was opened on the 27th July, 1888, with a speech by Palladius, then Exarch of Georgia and now Metropolitan of St. Petersburg. Two excursions have since been made over large portions of the country, and the results have been that many manuscripts, documents of various kinds, inscribed stones, and other relics of the past have been collected, partly preserved in monasteries and partly in private families. This collection has now been put under the care of Mr. M. Janashvili, an indefatigable antiquary, who has done much service to Georgia by his pen. His short history of the country is the one allowed by the Government to be used in schools where Georgian is taught. He has written on Georgian folklore and superstitions; a subject about which exceedingly little is known. We may mention also his book on the source of the Georgian romantic tale, *Amiran-Darejaniani*, a collection of adventures which are pervaded by a tone almost as knighthly as that of the Middle Ages. Upon this work a learned article has appeared by Mr. Marr, of the\nUniversity of St. Petersburg, in the Journal of the Minister of Public Instruction. It is strange to find this echo of the West in Georgian poetry. Shota Rustaveli, the author of their Ariosto-like epic previously alluded to, was a veritable troubadour, and completes the parallel by having nourished, it is said, a hopeless passion for Queen Tamara. And all this was done in Asia in the twelfth century. Of this poet Mr. Janashvili has written a short and interesting account in Georgian (Tiflis, 1896).\n\nThus the worthy Keeper of the Museum has occupied himself to the great advantage of Western students with the history, ethnology, and literature of his country. He has told us of the Georgian Church, of the folklore of his race, and among his latest works is a short account of Georgian literature, of which one part has appeared. Perhaps there may come a day when in England more interest may be taken in this remarkable people, a handsome, freedom-loving race, who have striven among their mountains for many centuries, boasting of an early Christianity, which dates from about the second century after Christ.\n\nIn conclusion we wish all success to Mr. Janashvili in his useful and learned labours.\n\nW. R. Morfill.\n\nThe Syriac Chronicle, known as that of Zachariah of Mitylene. Translated into English by F. J. Hamilton, D.D., and E. W. Brooks, M.A. (Methuen & Co., 1899. 12s. 6d.)\n\nThe ecclesiastical chronicle of a certain Zacharias, the Greek form of which had been lost, and which had been preserved only in a Syriac compilation of the middle of the sixth century, ranks amongst the most important works of its kind (v. Krummbacher, Byzant. Literaturgesch., 2nd ed., p. 403). The Syriac text has been published for the first time by Land. To the industry of Messrs. Hamilton and Brooks we owe now the first (as Mr. Hamilton had printed\nA HITTITE INSCRIPTION FOUND IN BABYLON.\n\na portion of it privately) complete and accessible English translation of the compilation, which contains the work of Zacharias. The interest of the translators lay more in the direction of the Ecclesiastical History, and they have therefore omitted, to the regret of the students of this branch of literature, the first portion, containing the legendary element\u2014e.g., the history of Joseph and Asenath, the acts of Sylvester, portions of the Nicodemus Gospel, etc. In an introduction, which is far too short, the relation in which the compiler stands to John of Ephesus and to the so-called \"Dionysius\" is clearly set forth. The translation reads very smoothly, and yet the character of the original has none the less been faithfully preserved. The editors still identify Zacharias Rhetor with Zacharias Scholasticus, hence some of the difficulties of chronology. They see in him the author of the Life of Severus and others. M. A. Kugener studies some of these writings in Byz. Zeitschrift, ix (1900), p. 464 ff., and promises to prove the difference between these two men in his forthcoming article in the Revue de l'Orient chr\u00e9tien.\n\nM. G.\n\nDr. Robert Koldewey. Die Hettitische Inschrift gefunden in der K\u00f6nigsburg von Babylon am 22 August, 1899, und ver\u00f6ffentlicht von . . . Mit einer Abbildung und drei Tafeln. (Wissenschaftliche Ver\u00f6ffentlichung der Deutschen Orient-Gesellschaft, Heft 1.) Folio. (Leipzig: J. C. Hinrich'sche Buchhandlung, 1900. 4 mk.)\n\nIn a short introduction of two pages, Professor Delitzsch explains the importance of this publication of the new German Oriental Society. It is thus far the only perfect specimen of a Hittite inscription, found on a statue of extremely archaic character, discovered in the old royal palace of Babylon. The stele is very much like the so-called God of thunder of the Hittites, found at Zingirli. The inscription consists of 273 signs, written 'boustrophedon' on seven\nlines, and the words are evidently separated one from the other by a certain sign, which consists of a small stroke and half-moon, the horns of which are turned in the direction of the script. Not a few of these signs are recurring more than once and will eventually assist in the decipherment of these curious hieroglyphs, which have thus far baffled the ingenuity of many a scholar. The photographic reproduction and the tracing of the characters in the three plates which accompany the text are admirable. No attempt is as yet made to grapple with the problem of the reading. And wisely so. As a curious fact it must be noted that this statue should have been found in the royal palace of Babylon, though the land of the Hittites was at least twenty-four days journey distant from that place. It is therefore not likely that it had been brought that distance and erected there as a mere piece of curious import. The full significance of its appearance there may perhaps become more clear by subsequent discoveries.\n\nM. G.\n\nIndian Chronology. An Essay by P. C. Mukerjee. pp. 95. (Lucknow: \"Express\" Office, 1899. Price, One Rupee.)\n\nThis essay by Mr. Mukerjee, who was employed by the Government on archaeological work last year, is a bold attempt to reconcile the acknowledged difficulties of early Indian Chronology. For some time past European scholars have been satisfied by the working hypothesis put forward by Cunningham which fixes the date of the Buddha's death at 477 B.C. This was arrived at by adding 218 years, the time stated in the Ceylon Chronicles to have elapsed between the death of the Buddha and the inauguration of Asoka, to the date of Asoka as fixed by the names of the Greek princes referred to in the Edicts. In other words, the hypothesis rejects the tradition handed down in the Ceylon Chronicles as to the dates of Asoka and of the Buddha, but accepts that tradition as to the interval between the two. As the\nhypothesis does not pretend to give any reason for its thus blowing hot and cold on the same authority, it must at least be admitted that it is not very logical.\n\nMr. Mukerjee points out that, as the Jain and Brahmin chronologies are in practical agreement with the Ceylon books as to the date of the Buddha and the Mah\u0101v\u012bra, that date (circa 620\u2013540 B.C.) ought not so easily to be set aside. And he proposes, as a reconciliation between it and the Greek dates, to identify Asoka the Maurya (and not his grandfather) with the Greek Sandracottus. Candragupta, he points out, is a biruda, or title only, and not a name. Grandfather and grandson may well have had the same title, as in the case of the other two Candraguptas in the fourth century A.D. It is to this Candragupta Asoka Dev\u0101nam-piya Piyadassi that the pillar edicts are to be assigned. And it is to his grandson, S\u0101mpati Dev\u0101nam-piya Piyadassi, that the rock edicts, mentioning the five Greek princes, are to be assigned. In both cases we find only Dev\u0101nam-piya Piyadassi in the inscriptions, and have hitherto taken this to mean Asoka the Mauryan throughout. All will be made clear if we, in interpreting the title, interpret it in two ways instead of in one.\n\nMr. Mukerjee supports this startling reconstruction by a number of arguments, and carries his results out with regard to other names. Thus, of the two Asokas he identifies the first with Nanda, the patron of the Ves\u0101li Council. It would be impossible in the course of a short notice to enter into the discussion of these numerous subsidiary points on which his main argument is based. That would require at least a lengthy article, not to say a book as long as his own. He makes his best points, and some of them are very good, when he is showing how unsatisfactory, and how difficult to reconcile with admitted data, is the working hypothesis which at present holds the field. The positive part of the argument is weaker; and does not sufficiently deal with the arguments, set out for instance by M. Senart, in favour of the unity of authorship of all the edicts. It is evident, indeed, throughout that the author has not properly\nread the greatest authority on the inscriptions of Piyadasi. That authority wrote, no doubt, in French, which he does not understand. But he ought at least to have considered more carefully the English translations which appeared in the *Indian Antiquary*.\n\nIt is a pity, too, that the essay does not give authorities for more of the statements it quotes. Authorities are given; but not enough. \"The Tibetans say\" or \"the Jains say\" is no use at all. We want to know the date and author of the statement. Even \"the Mah\u0101v\u0101sas says\" is not enough. We want chapter and verse. What is the use of giving as the sole authority for the statement that one K\u0101ty\u0101ya built a certain monastery in 443 A.D., Mrs. Sinnett's \"Five Years of Theosophy.\" It would have been better to have omitted the statement, which is of little or no importance for the author's main position. So loose a method of writing only prejudices the reader against the logical weight of the author he is reading.\n\nAt the same time it cannot be denied that there is much that is suggestive in this essay; and it is interesting to find a native of India even attempting to tackle a question involving frequent reference to Buddhist and Greek authorities with which Indians are not usually familiar. Some such hypothesis as the author's will, no doubt, be eventually accepted in place of the working hypothesis now so generally and unquestionably taken for granted. That is admittedly unsatisfactory. Whether the hypothesis to be eventually followed will be the one here put forward is another question. But the essayist certainly deserves great credit not only for raising the question, but for having devoted such wide reading and so much thought to its solution.\n\nT. W. Rhys Davids.\nRESEARCHES INTO THE ORIGIN OF THE PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS OF THE GREEKS, PHOENICIANS, AND BABYLONIANS. BY ROBERT BROWN, Jun., F.S.A. Vol. ii. (Williams & Norgate, 1900.)\n\nAgain the indefatigable student of the astronomy of the ancients presents to the public, in an attractive form, a mass of information, based upon his researches into the tablets of Babylonia and Assyria which refer to the constellations, and to the heavenly bodies in general, as they understood them. The amount of material, and the knowledge to be gained therefrom, are enormous. The difficulty is, to understand the texts aright, and to draw from their information, when rightly understood, the true deduction.\n\nThe first volume, which was noticed in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society for April last (pp. 371-375), contained eight chapters, dealing with the primitive constellations of the Greeks, the Hipparcho-Ptolemy star-list, the constellations in Greek literature, and in connection with the earlier coin-types, Homeric references to the constellations, constellation-subjects in the early art of the Aigion seaboard and Asia Minor, and Babylonian astronomy after Alexander. In this there was much that was interesting, and the importance of bringing together all available material was pointed out, and the results referred to. In the second volume, which is now before us, further and more extensive references to the tablets are given, as will be recognized from the headings of the chapters, which are as follows: \"The Constellations of the Babylonian Creation-scheme,\" \"Constellation-subjects in Euphratean Art,\" \"The Tablet of the Thirty Stars,\" \"Some Stellar Groups of Sevens,\" \"The Celestial Equator of Aratos,\" \"Further consideration of the Euphratean Celestial Sphere,\" \"The Euphratean Star-list,\" \"The General Concepts underlying the Constellation-figures,\" and \"The Formation of the Primitive Constellations.\" There are also several plates and figures in the text. The first volume\nwas dedicated to Professor Sayce, the second is dedicated to the memory of Fran\u00e7ois Lenormant.\n\nThere is no doubt that, as Mr. Brown claims, he has been able to compile a fairly complete list of Euphratean stars and constellations, but how far these are correctly read and identified time alone can tell. It is a matter of regret to me that I find myself unable to follow the author in all his conclusions, and that my readings, together with the significations that I give to the groups (when it is possible to assign to them a meaning), often differ greatly from his. I do not mean to say that the author is in every case wrong, but one cannot help wishing that greater caution had been exercised in both these respects.\n\nIn the first chapter of the second volume (ch. ix) the author examines the constellations of the Babylonian constellation-scheme, that curious and interesting description of the heavens given by one of the tablets of the series regarded and generally called \"the story of the Creation,\" but which would be more correctly described as \"the fight between Bel and the Dragon.\" In this now well-known classic of the Babylonians, there is a reference to the twelve months of the year, for each of which Merodach fixed three stars or constellations. This would make in all thirty-six constellations, and it is to the identity of these that the chapter is devoted.\n\nAs an aid to this, there exist in the British Museum certain fragments of astrolabes, the most important piece being that found by Mr. George Smith when excavating for the Trustees in 1874. This text is numbered S. 162, and fragments of a duplicate exist, the principal being 83\u20131\u201318, 608, found by Mr. Rassam in 1882. These astrolabes are arranged in concentric circles, the outermost containing the name of a month, a star or constellation, and a number; the second the name of another star or constellation, accompanied by a number half the value of the first; and the third a star or constellation, and a number half the value of that of the second row. There are, therefore, three stars or constellations for each month, corresponding\nwith the statement in the Babylonian Creation-Story, and there is every probability that Mr. Brown is right in regarding them as those which are referred to in that Legend.\n\nTaking these fragments as a base, Mr. Brown has completed the series, restoring the names of the remaining stars or constellations and the numbers in accordance with the system that the astrolabe seemed to indicate. The scheme is seductive, it is exceedingly probable, and the numbers follow a system which might easily be that of the ancient and unknown Babylonian who drew up and arranged the stars or constellations there enumerated.\n\nWhilst looking through some rough copies of inscriptions made by me many years ago, I noticed that two lists of stars were accompanied by numbers, and that these went in progression. I at once compared them with the fragments of the planisphere and with each other, the result being that I was able to restore the whole text of the document treated of by Mr. Brown.

The numbers attached to the second of each three constellations are exactly half those of the first series, and go from 120 for UR-A, under the month Sivan, to 60 for UD-GU-DU-A, under the month Chisleu, ascending again like those of the first series. The numbers attached to the third of each series are exactly, in their turn, half those of the second of each series, and go from 60, the number which accompanies NAGAR, under the month Sivan, to 30, the number accompanying UZ, under Chisleu. The numbers increase and decrease by 20, by 10, and by 5, for the first, second, and third series, respectively.\n\n\u00b9 Explained as m\u016bta, \"death.\"\n\u00b2 Explained as the god Mu\u0161tabarr\u00fb m\u00fatanu, \"the forecaster of death.\"\n\u00b3 Explained as \"the lady of the kid.\"\n\u2074 Explained as \"the lord of death, the god Ea.\"\n\u2075 Explained as \"the seat of God.\"\n\u2076 Explained as \"the hero of the Igigi.\"\n\u2077 Explained as \"the double (?) gods, Addu and Marduk.\"\n\u2078 Explained as \"the father of the stream.\"\n\u2079 Explained as \"the lady of life.\"\n\u00b9\u2070 Explained as \"the triple (?) god, the god Ea.\"\n\u00b9\u00b9 Explained as \"the lord causing to stand.\"\n\u00b9\u00b2 Explained as \"the king, the god of the Igigi.\"\nFrom the fragments of spheres, or astrolabes, at the author's disposal, he was able to obtain the necessary information to insert the numbers correctly for the constellations from the month Sivan to the month Chisleu, but instead of ascending again to 220 for the constellation MULA (under the month Iyyar), he has continued to descend to 20, 10, and 5, respectively. In addition to this, his names differ in every case, except for the constellations furnished by the fragments of the astrolabes, and for MAR-GID-DA, the third of the series for the month Ab, Zibanitum, the second of the series for the month Tisri, and AN-HU (to be pronounced T\u00ee), the third of the series for the month Tebet.\n\nThat the list which I have been able to consult is correct, must be conceded, but notwithstanding that it differs so considerably from Mr. Brown's reconstruction of the astrolabe, this difference can hardly be held to prove that he is wrong. Indeed, the fact that he has rightly located, in his restoration of the ancient astrolabes, MARGIDDA, Zibanitum, and T\u00ee, implies that he was on the right track, and that some of the remaining stars and constellations that he has located may turn out to be correctly placed when we know more of their duplicate names, and the appellations of the principal stars of which they are composed, and which may have been used by the ancient Babylonians to indicate the constellations to which they belonged. In one case at least, however, he can hardly be right, and that is his location of NU-SIR-DA (or NU-MUS-DA, as I have read it). This he has placed in the third series, under the month Tisri, notwithstanding that the astrolabe-fragment 83-1-18, 608 has in this place the remains of a line giving the two characters \\( \\text{\\textasciitilde} \\text{\\textasciitilde} \\), which are undoubtedly to be completed \\( \\text{\\textasciitilde} \\text{\\textasciitilde} \\text{\\textasciitilde} \\text{\\textasciitilde} \\), generally read, as provisionally here, EN-TE-NA-MA\u0160-LUM.\\(^1\\)\n\n\\(^1\\) A better reading would probably be En-te-na-ma\u0161-lum, but the word is a very doubtful one.\nThere is much of interest in the book, but one cannot help thinking, and greatly regretting, that it is before its time. Babylonian astronomy is such a difficult subject, and there is so much more to learn about it, that no one can lay down hard and fast lines as to the identity of the names that they gave to the heavenly bodies, which, closely connected as they were with their religion, were bound to have more than one name, and to be connected in more than one way.\n\nNevertheless, the book will be found interesting, and very useful, for those who wish to see the diverse opinions of scholars upon the identifications of the stars and star-names as we find them inscribed on the tablets of Babylonia and Assyria. Hommel, Jensen, Oppert, Sayce, and many others are all quoted, and whatever may be the opinion about the book, it must be recognized as the most complete work upon ancient astronomy yet published. It is the work of a widely-read scholar, who can, and probably will, improve upon it in the near future. Classified indexes are appended, and the insertion of references in full is a feature, and a useful one, of the second volume, as it was of the first.\n\nT. G. Pinches.\n\nA History of Sanskrit Literature. By Arthur A. Macdonell, M.A., Ph.D., Boden Professor of Sanskrit in the University of Oxford. (London: Heinemann, 1900.)\n\nDuring the past few years much has been done to make smooth the path of the Oriental student; and those of us who gained our knowledge of the history of Sanskrit literature chiefly from Professor Weber's excellent, but by no means easy, work on the subject will think with a sigh how much toil we might have been spared by such a book as the present. The design of the series to which it belongs\u2014\"Short Histories of the Literatures of the World,\" published by Mr. Heinemann under the editorship of Mr. Edmund Gosse\u2014is, evidently, to supply a trustworthy and, at the same time, a thoroughly readable account of the\nmost noteworthy national literatures. Professor Macdonell's book amply satisfies these requirements. He has taken in review all the most recent results of the different branches of Indian research, so far as they can be brought to bear on the solution of literary problems; and he has succeeded in treating his subject in such a way as to make it interesting from beginning to end to all who care for such matters. But he has done more than this. He has supplied the needs of the special student, who may desire to enter upon a more minute investigation of any topic dealt with comprehensively in the text, by an excellent series of \"Bibliographical Notes\" appended to each chapter. No better advice can be given to the student who wishes to gain a thorough acquaintance with the history of Sanskrit literature than to take this book as a basis and to fill in the outline given in the text with the details supplied by the monographs referred to in the Bibliographical Notes, and, of course, such standard works as Max M\u00fcller's History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature and Weber's Indian Literature. Professor Macdonell's book may, perhaps, be best compared with Professor L. von Schroeder's Indiens Literatur und Cultur, with the important difference that it is thirteen years later in point of date and records the by no means insignificant conquests which scholarship has made during that interval. It must not be forgotten, moreover, that a very creditable proportion of this new information, especially in the region of Vedic religion and mythology, is the result of the author's own work. Altogether, he is to be very heartily congratulated on the firstfruits of his tenure of the Boden Professorship.\n\nE. J. RAPSON.\n\nIBN \u0120AUZ\u012a'S MAN\u0100Q\u012aB 'OMAR IBN 'ABD EL 'AZ\u012aZ BESPROCHEN UND IM AUSZUGE MITGETEILT VON CARL HEINRICH BECKER. 8vo; pp. viii, 22, 168. (Berlin, 1900.)\n\nAmongst the Umayyad Caliphs 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz is chiefly notable for his mild and upright disposition.\nAlthough somewhat bigoted in his piety, yet, in his desire of scrupulously acting in all things according to the divine law, he could be just even towards his non-Moslem subjects. 'Umar's brief reign of barely two and a half years (A.H. 99-101) was not distinguished by any very remarkable act or achievement. He neither made nor attempted fresh conquests, but appears to have principally directed his policy towards the consolidation of his dominions and the amelioration of the condition of his people. Owing to his devout and religious tendencies, 'Umar's court was much frequented by theologians and scholars, and he himself early acquired a reputation as a traditionist and divine. Writers of later times depict him as a saint, investing him with all the attributes usually associated with such a character, and it is largely from this point of view that 'Umar's life is treated by Ibn al-Jauzi in the work now under notice.\n\nIbn al-Jauzi was born at Baghdad in A.H. 510 of a wealthy family which traced its descent from the Caliph Abu Bakr. From a very early age he devoted himself to the acquisition of learning, and finally attained to a very high position as traditionist, theologian, and preacher. He died in A.H. 597, leaving behind him an immense number of works upon every branch of learning and science, of which unfortunately only too few have reached us.\n\nThe present life of 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz is not a biography in the ordinary sense, but consists of a collection of anecdotes, letters, speeches, and pious sayings, designed for purposes of edification. The contents of the work are arranged in forty-four chapters according to subjects, each chapter for the most part illustrating some quality or attribute of the Caliph. As might be expected, considering the biographical nature of the book, much that is of historical value is mixed up with a great deal that is legendary. The materials of which the work is composed have been gathered from many different sources, varying greatly in value. In the editor's introduction twenty-seven authors are enumerated whose writings have been used in its composition, most of which appear to have perished.\nThe text, moreover, is not in its original state as it left Ibn al-Jauzi's hands, but presents a contemporary recension which is due to the famous warrior, statesman, and poet, Us\u0101ma ibn Munkid, whose autobiography has been published by H. Derenbourg (Paris, 1886).\n\nThe editor, albeit only a single MS. has been accessible to him, has done his work conscientiously and well, making the best use for critical purposes of such parallel texts as were available to him. He has not presented us with the full text of the book, but only with a judicious selection from it, including the preface of Us\u0101ma. An introduction is prefixed in which are treated the origin and nature of Ibn al-Jauzi's work, with a brief survey of the legendary matter contained in it. The purely historical materials afforded by the book the editor proposes to discuss in another place.\n\nA. G. E.\nNOTES OF THE QUARTER.\n\n(April, May, June, 1900.)\n\nI.

Wickremasinghe,\n28. Mrs. Beveridge,\n29. Mrs. Rauschenbusch-Clough,\n30. Dr. Sangat Ram.\n\nOf the subscribing Libraries, one has retired and two have been added to the list.\n\nThe result is that the membership of the Society, which has gone slowly but steadily up for a number of years, stood on the 1st January, 1900, at four less than the highest point previously reached, which was last year, and nineteen higher than the year before. The number of paying members\u2014that is to say, 88 resident members, 271 non-resident and library members, and 55 libraries\u2014is, however, one more than it was last year, the reduction being in the number of compounders. It is especially satisfactory that the number of resident members, which had been gradually going down till last year, when it, for the first time, showed an increase, has kept up to the same figure.\n\nThe total nett receipts of the Society came to \u00a31,275 5s. 6d., which is \u00a331 2s. 11d. more than last year, the income from members' subscriptions having gone up from \u00a3612 1s. 6d. to \u00a3628 5s. 6d., the highest amount yet received under that head. The total of the nett ordinary expenditure of the Society was \u00a31,255 19s. 4d., and an extra-ordinary claim had to be met owing to the unfortunate accident of the skylight over the stairs falling in. As the landlords would bear no part in the cost of restoring the skylight, the Society had to do so at the expense of \u00a329 18s., which the Council have thought it best to meet out of current revenue. In spite of this the sum of \u00a344 2s. 6d. has been added to the Society's account in the Post Office Savings Bank, which numerically stood at the end of the year at \u00a3115 10s. 3d. The Society's capital funds had therefore risen at the same date to a total of \u00a31,329 2s. 3d., which\nis just \u00a3500 more than it stood at a few years ago. This amount represents the composition fees paid by our 97 compounding members, and the Council hold it to be most desirable that this sum, now amounting to little more than one year's income, should be kept intact as a reserve in case of need.\n\nThe Medal fund which was mentioned as in process of formation in our last report to the Society is now so far practically assured that a sum of \u00a3268 3s. 6d. has been invested in the name of the Society in the purchase of \u00a3250 Nottingham Corporation Stock, and the further subscriptions still expected or promised will bring that sum up to the amount required to make the Medal a permanent institution. The accounts submitted to you close the account, as the further sums to be received will be lodged at once, without passing through our banking account, in a special deposit account that has been opened in the Post Office, and the Medal Fund will therefore not appear in next year's balance sheet. The hope expressed in our last report has thus been fulfilled; and the Council know they will be giving expression to the feelings of all members of the Society in expressing to Mr. Wollaston, to whose initiative and earnest work this result is due, their most cordial thanks.\n\nLast year the Oriental Translation Fund made its first modest appearance in our accounts. The sale of the Harsa Carita still goes on, and explains the slight increase in the Fund. During the year Dr. Gaster's translation of the Chronicles of Jerahme\u00ebl has appeared; and the volume for the year 1900, Mrs. Rhys Davids's translation of the Dhamma Sangani, a Buddhist manual of psychological ethics, is now just ready. The Council regret to say that Mr. Arnold C. Taylor has given up his intention of translating the Katn\u0101 Vatthu. But the Council trust that the Secretary will be able to undertake this work himself, and that the volumes just referred to will maintain the high credit of the series. The Council congratulate the Society on the fact that this very important branch of the Society's work is going regularly on. In this matter also the Society is under deep\nobligation to one of its members. Without Mr. Arbuthnot's care and thought and generosity the series, which had been allowed to drop, would never have been started into life again, and the Society cannot too often repeat its thanks to him. The Council again express the hope that other members of the Society will follow the excellent example set them by the Earl of Northbrook and Mr. Sturdy by contributing, either by legacies or donations, to the necessary expense of this valuable endeavour to make the West a little more acquainted with the thought of the East. It is really only a question of money. There are scholars able and willing to do the work. There are at least some hundreds of MSS. on our shelves which ought to be made accessible to scholars. But unless the Council are provided with the necessary means the work, in spite of its importance, will once again have to be dropped.\n\nWith regard to the Journal the Council have taken great pains throughout the year to ensure that its contents shall be both varied and interesting, and that no article shall be admitted which does not contain a distinct contribution to human knowledge. In doing so they have to depend upon the kindness of those members of the Society and others who offer them articles. It is this which determines the scope and nature of the subjects discussed. Subject to this the Council hope that the Journal has been worthy during the year under review of its high reputation, and has tended toward the advancement of Oriental learning. The estimate in which it is held abroad is shown by the receipts from its sale, which, together with the few minor items of receipts from the Journal, again exceeds \u00a3200.\n\nAbout 220 volumes have been added to the Library during the year. The number of volumes acquired since the present catalogue was closed, at the end of 1893, is somewhat over 2,000; the number of entries in the supplemental card catalogue now amounting to 4,250.\n\nDuring the year the English, French, German, and Austrian Committees of the International Fund for the Archaeological Exploration of India have been...\nThe Central Committee, which is to meet in London, will be convened when these national committees are in a position to report.\n\nThe Statutory Commission for the formation of the new University for London did not accede to the Council's request to create a faculty of Oriental languages, history, and archaeology. The Council are considering what steps it would therefore be expedient to take to further the project of an Oriental School. Public opinion is apparently not yet sufficiently advanced to realize the immediate value in questions of economics, philosophy, and history, of the facts that can only be learnt by a study of the East. It may perhaps be more awake to the commercial advantages of the study of Oriental languages, and of a knowledge of the habits and the ideas of those peoples in the East, with whom we may hope to enter into trade. In any case the Council will do the best that can be done in this matter, which they regard as one of national importance.\n\nUnder the Rules of the Society, Lord Stanmore retires from the office of Vice-President. The Council recommend the election as Vice-Presidents for the ensuing term of three years of Lord Stanmore and Sir W. Lee Warner.\n\nUnder the Rules of the Society, Dr. Thornton, Mr. Arbuthnot, Sir Cuthbert Peek, Colonel Temple, and Mr. Watters retire this year from the Council. Of these five gentlemen two only are re-eligible this year. The Council recommend the election in their place of Dr. Thornton, Mr. Arbuthnot, Professor Douglas, Professor Macdonell, and Mr. Grierson.\n\nThe Council would also recommend that the following names be removed from the list of the Society's members, in accordance with Rule 3, on the ground of non-payment of subscriptions:\n\n1. Mr. B. D\u00e9.\n2. Mr. W. Driver.\n3. Mr. B. L. Gupta.\n4. Mr. Hira Lal.\nThe usual statement of accounts is laid on the table, and the Council would ask for a vote of thanks to the Honorary Auditors, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Rapson, and Mr. J. D. Anderson.\n\nSir Charles Lyall, in moving the adoption of the Report, said: My Lord, Ladies and Gentlemen,\u2014I have been entrusted with the duty of moving the adoption of the Report, which I regret to hear is not yet in your hands. It announces in the usual way the losses of the Society by death and resignation, and the addition of members who have joined the Society during the year. It gives a statement of your finances, and congratulates you upon the good condition and soundness of your position; and it then goes on to discuss the separate funds which we administer\u2014the Medal Fund and the Translation Fund\u2014and concludes with observations upon the progress of the Society's Journal and other publications. I think, ladies and gentlemen, that when you receive the Report you will agree with me that it is a highly satisfactory one. Last year, as Colonel Temple observed when he was moving the adoption of the Report for that year, the highest point had been reached at which the prosperity of the Society had ever stood. When the highest point has been reached, one unfortunately has to be prepared for some declension, but in the present case the declension, if any, has been very slight. We are four members less numerically than we were last year, and our finances are a few pounds better. Our resident members have increased by one, and the paying members, who are naturally the backbone of the Society's finances, are as numerous as before. The expenditure of the Society has been of the usual character, except that an unfortunate demand for repairs of our premises had to be met which had not been provided for, and we are left with a smaller balance than we usually possess. You know, ladies and gentlemen, that our finances are not calculated to admit of the accumulation of a large sum, and it is not for the best interests of a Society like ours to hoard or save. We ought to spend all we get and trust to providence future. (Hear, hear.)\n## Abstract of Receipts and Expenditure for the Year 1899\n\n### Receipts\n\n| Description                                      | Amount |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Subscriptions                                    | \u00a323.5s.|\n| Donation from the India Office                   | \u00a36.10s.|\n| Sale of Pamphlets                                 | \u00a34.10s.|\n| Sale of Other Outside Advertisements              | \u00a37.6s. |\n| Subscriptions paid in error                      | \u00a31.10s.|\n| Total                                             | \u00a340.10s|\n\n### Expenditure\n\n| Description                                      | Amount |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| House Rent                                       | \u00a35.10s.|\n| Rates                                            | \u00a315.10s.|\n| Gas                                              | \u00a35.0s. |\n| Coal                                             | \u00a315.0s.|\n| Library Fee                                      | \u00a310.0s.|\n| Insurance                                        | \u00a310.0s.|\n| Stationery                                       | \u00a35.0s. |\n| Printing                                         | \u00a35.0s. |\n| Library New Books                                | \u00a310.0s.|\n| Printing                                         | \u00a35.0s. |\n| Postage                                          | \u00a35.0s. |\n| Miscellaneous                                    | \u00a35.0s. |\n| Total expenditure                                | \u00a360.10s|\n\n### Balance at Bank January 1, 1899\n\n- Petty Cash: \u00a310.0s.\n\n### Notes\n\n- Total expenditure: \u00a360.10s.\n- Balance at Bank January 1, 1899: \u00a310.0s.\n\n---\n\n*Excerpts with the kind permission of Mr. H.

He has now almost reached the acme of his hopes, and has finally established the Medal upon a solid foundation. I believe that your President will announce to you today the name of the gentleman to whom the Medal has on this occasion been awarded, and I think he will give you also some very gratifying information as to the circumstances under which the award is to be made.\n\nOur Translation Fund has not made very much progress during the past year, but we always hope that some generous person will come to our aid and will provide the necessary funds for carrying it on. Our Journal has been marked by the usual variety of topics treated, and I am sure that those who have seen it will agree that it has maintained the very high standard of past years. We also have full confidence that the standard will be maintained in the future. We have to congratulate the Society upon the accession to its Council of such distinguished authorities in their lines as Professor Douglas, Professor Macdonell, the successor of Sir Monier Monier-Williams at Oxford, and Dr. Grierson.\n\nI think that I may invite you confidently to accept the Report, and move that it be printed.\n\nMr. Vincent Smith, in seconding the adoption of the Report, said: My Lord, Ladies and Gentlemen.\u2014The Society, ever since Professor Rhys Davids has assumed the office of Secretary, has been accustomed to receive each year a satisfactory Report. The document which has been presented this year, and with the sight of a proof of which I have been favoured, is no exception to the rule. As Sir Charles Lyall has pointed out, our numbers remain practically unimpaired, our finances are sound, and the scientific reputation of our Journal continues to be undimmed. The Journal, as we all know, has been admirably edited, and has appeared with most commendable punctuality. In the matter of numbers, I think that every member of the Society can do a good deal to still further improve the\nstrength of our Association. Everyone, even the most silent of our body, can do something in the way of recruiting. My own limited personal experience has shown that very many gentlemen only want to be asked, and that if they are asked they will join. It was my good fortune last year in India to recruit several of our distinguished native Indian officials, and I believe that if the members who are resident in India would exert themselves in that direction, a very considerable number of valuable recruits can be obtained in India. Perhaps the same may be the case in other dependencies, but I only know of India. My own work has lain in the North-West Provinces, where education is much more backward than it is in the older Provinces, and I believe that if our members in Madras and Bombay Presidencies, where education is more advanced, would exert themselves, they could get a considerable number of members among the native Indian gentlemen. One of the recent accessions, Pandit Ramashankar Misra, M.A., has promised to send me a paper for submission to the Society on the \"Tenets of the Kabirpanthi Sect,\" of which he is a member, and it is obvious that a gentleman who is himself a member of one of the Indian religious sects can treat the subject in a way to which no European can aspire. I think that we might by interesting native gentlemen do a good deal towards adding to the variety and interest of our Journal.\n\nThe valuable assistance given by ladies to this Society is one of the most pleasing features of our operations. The Journal has been enriched by more than one paper from ladies throwing light upon the mysteries of Buddhism, and we have this year to acknowledge the very exceptional service done by the work on Indian Chronology, for which we are indebted to Miss Mabel Duff, and which goes a long way to smooth the extremely thorny path of the historian of India.\n\nAll present to-day will no doubt regret the absence of two of our most distinguished Indian members. I refer to Dr. Burgess and Dr. Grierson, who has just been elected\na member of the Council. I had the pleasure of hearing from them both the other day, and they entrusted me with messages. Dr. Grierson, as you are aware, is engaged on a gigantic task, namely, the linguistic survey of India. He submitted a memorandum to the Congress at Rome in November last reporting progress up to date. He has asked me to tell you today that since November he has been devoting himself to the non-Aryan languages of Assam. He has completed the Khasi family and the Bodo group of the Tibetan Burmese, both of which are in an advanced stage of proof. He hopes to have the specimen of the remaining Tibeto-Burman and of the Shan languages similarly advanced by October next. He has discovered the existence of a language of Indian origin, called Pashai, in the heart of Afghanistan, and has sent an account of it to this Society. His investigation has already disclosed the existence of three other isolated islands of speech, in localities where no one could expect to find them. An outcast tribe in the Midnapur District of Bengal speaks the same language, a corrupt form of Gujarati, which is spoken by the Bhils, a thousand miles to the west. Two tribes of the Swat Valley speak the tongue of the Rajputs of Mewar, a thousand miles to the south, and the people of the Oriya State, Basra, speak a dialect of Bihari. Those are amongst the curiosities which the linguistic survey has brought to light, and I need hardly say that Mr. Grierson's further labours will result in still more valuable and solid acquisitions to our knowledge.\n\nDr. Burgess has asked me to try and arouse sufficient enthusiasm in the Society to encourage the preparation of a good Dictionary of Indian Mythology and Antiquities on the plan of my namesake's well-known Classical Dictionaries. No worker in any of the fields of Indian research can fail to feel the urgent want that there is for such a book of reference and the miserably inadequate character of the books that have tried to fill the void. The work is one which is far too great for any single scholar, and it can only be done by an association of scholars working under the control of a competent editor, and I hope that the\nCouncil will see fit to take Dr. Burgess's suggestion into practical consideration. I believe the thing could be done, and that if it were done it would not only be of great value to all Oriental students but might reasonably expect to be a commercial success. (Hear, hear.)\n\nIt must be a matter of much gratification to all the members of this Society to see that His Excellency, Lord Curzon, has taken so great an interest in Indian history and antiquities and in the conservation of ancient monuments. It is understood that when he can find some leisure from the pressing duties which the calamities of plague and famine in India have imposed upon him, he hopes to reorganize the Archaeological Survey on a more satisfactory basis than has hitherto been the case. I cannot now discuss that question, but there is one point which I think might be brought to the notice of the Government of India, and that is that the great difficulty is to obtain suitable men, and suitable men will not be obtained so long as the pay of an Archaeological Surveyor begins at 300 rupees per month. The recent scheme arranged that the pay should rise from 300 to 800 rupees a month, and the final pay is enough, but 300 rupees means only \u00a3240 sterling a year, and you will not get anyone who is worth anything to go to India for \u00a3240 a year. The minimum pay should be 400 or 500 rupees a month, and then it can stop at 800 if the Government do not care to offer more.\n\nI must not trespass longer on your patience now, but I do not like to sit down without expressing the very special obligations that all students of Orientalism are under to our learned Secretary, Professor Rhys Davids, for the two books which he has recently given to the world, namely, \"The American Lectures on Buddhism,\" and \"The Dialogues of the Buddha,\" which both throw a flood of light upon the early primitive Buddhism. (Hear, hear.) When I say that the hearty thanks of the Society have been earned by and are due to Professor Rhys Davids, our Secretary, to Miss Hughes, the Assistant-Secretary\u2014(hear, hear)\u2014and all the Officers of the Society, I feel that I am only expressing the\nsentiments of every member both present and absent. (Applause.)\n\nThe adoption of the Report was unanimously agreed to.\n\nDr. Gaster: My Lord, Ladies and Gentlemen,\u2014May I be allowed to address the meeting on a subject which, to my mind, is of paramount importance to this Society and the whole empire. Not very long ago I had the honour of representing the Society in Berlin, and I then met an old member of the Society, a great scholar\u2014Professor Sachau who is filled with love for England. He has lived long enough in England to appreciate its greatness, and one of his best books has been published in English. He expressed himself very delighted with the great progress that this Society has made during the last ten or fifteen years. He spoke with the highest approbation of the articles that have appeared in the Journal, and I am sure that I am not exaggerating in stating that the last two numbers were certainly the best that have appeared hitherto. Very little attention is paid in general to what comes from abroad, but in questions of science attention must be paid. There is no difference between one country and the other, and it is to me a great privilege to be able to offer the unstinted praise that has come from abroad to the Society.\n\nI do not think I would be doing justice to myself, to you or to the Society in confining myself simply to a report of flattering statements from abroad. These were mixed with an expression of surprise that so very little is understood in England as to the importance of this Society and to the importance which the knowledge of Oriental languages possesses for a worldwide Empire such as England is. They cannot understand how it is possible that no University should be founded here with a faculty especially filled with Professors who represent all the varieties of Oriental and other languages. Professor Sachau mentioned to me that in Berlin, where he is the head of the Oriental Seminary, there are at least sixteen Professors under him; and this is only a detached branch of the University work. I took the trouble to look through th\n\"Minerva\" a few minutes ago to see how many Professors are appointed to teach Oriental languages in the University, and I find that there are no less than thirteen Professors and Lecturers, not including the Professors who are attached to the Theological faculties, and who also teach Hebrew and allied Semitic languages. Over 170 students attend the Seminary in Berlin. In Leipzig there are about twelve or thirteen Professors, but no seminary. I turn now to Paris, and I find that at L'Ecole des Langues Orientales Vivantes, with nineteen Professors, they pay no less than \u00a36,500 in salaries. The number of students attending in Paris is, if anything, larger than those attending in Berlin. I have not calculated the ten Professors of the Sorbonne, the nine of the College de France, and those of the University proper. I leave you to draw your own conclusions as to how much is done there.\n\nIf I turn to St. Petersburg I am sure the numbers will be much higher. What is done now in this country? Absolutely nothing. In the Report we are told that hope is held out that something may be done, that some miracle will happen one day, when we shall awake to find ourselves with a school for Oriental languages. We pride ourselves in this country that we are very practical. Allow me to speak of \"we,\" for I have lived long enough in this country to identify myself with its highest interests; and in bringing the little knowledge I possess from abroad to bear upon the question, I assure you it is done only with the sincerest wish to see the progress in the study of Oriental languages as high in England as in other countries in the world. I cannot understand how it is possible that the practical English nation is unable to grasp the importance of Oriental studies, and, to my mind, this Society holds the key of the Orient; the key of the great economic problems that will be evolved there, and unless we make ourselves the masters of the key, how can we wonder if the Germans or others outstrip us all over the East? I think it is a duty that I owe to the Society and the country, especially as I see the Press represented, to bring this before\nyou strongly. We are not mere theoretical dreamers, and it ought to be understood that no practical work can be of any success that is not backed by theoretical teaching. We must start from scientific principles, and recognize that the training of the mind rules in the first instance the development of the nation and of worlds; the practical application is then mere child's play. Under Professor Sachau's direction students are fitted first with a theoretical knowledge, and then follows the practical application. They prepare scientific papers which appear in a Journal under his direction and that of other Professors. Many years ago I remember Professor Foy coming through Roumania to learn Turkish, and he is now one of the most prominent teachers. How do they teach? They discuss and study first the theoretical questions of the language and are led on to its practical use. All this may have a very theoretical appearance, but these are the men who are sent out afterwards as Consuls, as Government Inspectors, as Teachers, as Guides, and as the men who are entrusted with the commercial undertakings of those countries which Germany governs in Asia and Africa. Why should this not be done here? It could easily be accomplished, and if we can learn anything from abroad we ought to learn how to compete with them, not only in their practical achievements but also in the theoretical achievements of which they can boast.\n\nI think it ought to be brought home to the great corporations that are so much identified with the best interests of commerce. It is necessary to point out to them that technical education is only one branch. It is the training of the mind which is of paramount importance; and if they will lend a hand in establishing here a kind of seminary on a similar scale as abroad, I am sure they will not only benefit themselves but the country in the highest degree possible. It will be the duty of the University, I conceive, to make the theoretical background, to prepare the Professors, to establish that part of the education left as a rule to the University, and then both together will naturally do the thing which is right. If it can be done through the initiative of this\nSociety, stimulated by the few words I have been able to say here, I am sure we shall have done something worthy of the occasion. (Hear, hear.)\n\nMr. R. A. Yerburyh, M.P.: My Lord, Ladies and Gentlemen,\u2014I am sure we are all indebted to Dr. Gaster for putting his views before us in so complete and convincing a manner. This particular question was brought up, if my memory serves me right, at the last annual meeting of the Society, and I then had the opportunity of saying a few words upon it. I think it was myself who expressed the hope that the time might arrive when some millionaire would be disposed to found a University for the study of Oriental languages. The point I wish to put before the meeting is this, that since last year something practical has been done. A Committee was formed of certain people who are interested in the position of affairs in the Far East. They have the money to carry on their scheme for five years, and they have decided to attempt the practical teaching of Chinese in London. A retired Consul has most kindly undertaken to supervise the work, and he is now in China or on his way back. He has secured the services of two natives who will be prepared to teach Chinese under his direction. That, I think, is a very fair beginning, a small thing perhaps in itself, but we have every reason to hope that advantage will be taken of our efforts, and perhaps this enterprise may be the commencement of a University such as we have had sketched out. There is, however, a great difficulty to be overcome. The people of this country are so extremely apathetic. Business men in London have been appealed to, and I have endeavoured to interest the business people of Manchester, where I attended the meeting which was held on behalf of Owens College some months ago. It was then proposed that a similar Chair should be established there, and, indeed, two gentlemen were found prepared to subscribe \u00a325 per annum each for five years, but up to the present moment not another contribution so far as I know has been promised. I have also brought the subject before a large meeting in Halifax. It was received with enthusiasm,\nbut from that day to this I have heard nothing more of it. The only advice I can offer is, that if we intend to succeed we must, vulgarly speaking, keep on \"pegging away.\" We must take every opportunity of pressing the subject upon the notice of our fellow-countrymen. I know their comprehension is slow; they are difficult to move, but when once they get hold of an idea they do not let go of it easily, they work it out, and therefore I have really good hopes that when this practical Chair of Chinese has been working in London for two years we may find it followed by the establishment of Chairs of other Oriental languages, and that at no very distant date we may see a University similar to the Oriental University at Berlin established in our midst. (Applause.)\n\nMr. Beveridge: My Lord, Ladies and Gentlemen,\u2014I should like to say a few words about the Translations from the Oriental languages, and I wish to draw attention especially to a valuable translation made lately by a member of our Society; I refer to the translation of the Memoirs of Jahangir, by Mr. Rogers. The original is a most interesting work and full of information. He has made reference to the plague, to the gallant conduct of the English at Surat, and many other things. The translation is a most elaborate work. I saw it the other day in this room. There are two parts, and he has made a complete index, and I think it is a great pity that a translation, which I am sure must be a good one, should remain buried away. Mr. Rogers has made his translation from the printed edition which was issued from Aligarh, but besides that printed volume there are many manuscripts, and in the British Museum there is a translation by that great scholar William Erskine. I presume Mr. Rogers has compared his translation with that, but if he has not he ought to do so before finally publishing it. I have lately returned from India, where I went to look for Persian manuscripts, and if I may be allowed to trespass upon your patience for a few minutes, I will give you the result of my investigations. The first thing that struck me was the fact that many\nmanuscripts have disappeared. I went to one or two places which were famous seats of learning, and I could not find a single manuscript. On questioning people about them they said, \"Oh yes, one man had had manuscripts up to three years ago, and then his house was burnt and all lost.\" Elliot speaks of that valuable book the T\u0101r\u012bkh Rashidi, which was recently translated by Denison Ross, as common in India, yet Mr. Ney Elias mentions in the introduction that he could not find a single copy in India. I found several, but it is by no means common. I discovered a very good copy in Hyderabad, and another in Delhi, and another in the excellent library at Rampur. I was about seven months in India, and although I must say I failed in the main object of my journey, yet I was not altogether unsuccessful. My chief object was to find a particular manuscript written by a lady, but I could not get any information about it. I saw many interesting things and I also got a few manuscripts. Among other things I have stood upon the place where the great Akbar was born, and I found that place is very different from what we are led to believe. It is usually supposed that he was born inside the fort, but according to local tradition he was born under a tree in the fields about a mile away. I saw the tomb of Abul Fazl, who was murdered on his way back to Agra. This murder took place in the village of Antari, in the Gwalior State, and there is the grave to this day, but it is sadly neglected. I was indebted for the knowledge of this fact to a Hindustani book published lately in Lahore. Mr. Blochmann says nothing about the man being buried there. I saw the tomb of Bada\u016bn\u012b, which Mr. Blochmann had failed to find, and it is still in good preservation. In the way of manuscripts I found a Persian translation of a book by Albir\u016bn\u012b, the original of which seems to be totally lost, and the Persian translation is unknown in Europe. I procured some local histories and so on, and I think that if I had stayed longer and had had more money I could have done much more, but certainly the time is fast slipping away. Every year manuscripts are being lost, so that although the Persian\ntranslation is a very important thing, I think still more important is the publication of the text. If we once have the text published we may wait for the translation, as the thing is safe, but several books have been totally lost because they have been allowed to remain in manuscript and never printed.\n\nLord Rey: Ladies and Gentlemen,\u2014I wish to support the adoption of the Report, and before I make any remarks on the Report, there is one subject which I am sure is in all our thoughts and to which I think some allusion must be made, and that is what Mr. Vincent Smith has so aptly called the terrible calamities of which India is a victim at the present moment. I must say that all we hear and read of the extent of the famine (I use that word although I have always considered the expression misleading; pauperism is the word I would rather use) which at this moment prevails in India is of such a nature that we must all feel that it is a gigantic evil. When we so often hear that abroad just now the feelings towards this country are not exactly friendly, I think that we ought to take note of the fact that in Berlin a large subscription was given on behalf of the suffering caused by the famine. There is another country with which in former days our relations were very friendly and may become friendly again, namely, Turkey. The Turks, as we all know, are very generous, perhaps too generous, and the Sultan has given authority to collect money for the Indian famine. I need not say that the Americans, who on a previous occasion have sent help to our people, have also on this occasion shown their sympathy on an effective scale. I think these are features of an international feeling which we on this side ought to appreciate, and which at all events are rays of sun-shine.\n\nNow, I must in the first place allude to the losses which this Society has sustained, and I shall take what I consider to be the most grievous loss, because in recording the illustrious dead we should always regret most, I think, those whose lives have been cut short when they were full of promise. (Hear, hear.) In the death of that most\npromising young American scholar, Mr. Warren, whose works gave so much promise for the study of Pali and Buddhism, we have to deplore the death of a man who, I am sure, would in future years have added much to our fund of Oriental knowledge. Then there is another man on this list who was in his way a most remarkable man. I mean Mr. Simpson. He was not intended to be a scholar, but he developed his scholarship in connection with other duties, and what he gave to the world with regard to the countries he was led to visit for other purposes is, I am told, of a very important nature. Then the name of Sir Monier Monier-Williams is familiar to us all. We know that an Institute was founded through him at Oxford, and we know how persevering and enthusiastic he was in all that he undertook for the benefit of Oriental students. Then there is another name which I know gives rise, unfortunately, to very different feelings, but for my part I am bound to say that my relations with Dr. Leitner have always been extremely cordial. I found that when an appeal was made to him not to push certain of his own opinions which he held very strongly, I never had any difficulty in getting him to yield to what were the considerations urged by others. I should also like to say that I am not going to enter upon a controversy about Dr. Leitner's works, but of this I am convinced, that he had a true feeling of friendship and of regard for Orientals, and that on every occasion, whatever may have been the methods he used, his paramount desire was to make us realize more the intricacy of matters connected with Oriental affairs.\n\nThe next statement that I have to make, as Sir Charles Lyall has mentioned to you, is regarding the award of the Medal. It has on this occasion been awarded to Dr. E. West, and you will be pleased to hear that the Prince of Wales has consented to hand the Medal to the scholar who has been fortunate enough to be selected for what I consider to be the highest honour which it is possible in this country to confer on an Oriental scholar.\n\nI join heartily in what has already been said, that the\nCouncil owe a debt of gratitude to Mr. Wollaston for the energy which he has displayed in obtaining funds for us and in bringing this matter to a satisfactory conclusion. I wish to read to you what is stated with regard to the Oriental Translation Fund in the Report. [Portion of Report read.]\n\nMr. Beveridge and Mr. Vincent Smith have alluded to the translations, and it is most important that for this Oriental Translation Fund we should have more money. There are, of course, numbers of books which require to be edited. We have a number of manuscripts which we should like to make accessible to scholars, but unless these funds are forthcoming, I need not tell you that we are very much crippled. I may also mention that we have been negotiating with Mr. Le Strange on the publication of the Geography of Mesopotamia, which will be published by the Oxford Clarendon Press, and another work is by Major Gerini, on the Ancient Geography of the Far East. I am happy to be able to tell you that the publication of this volume has been made secure by co-operation between us and the Geographical Society, the two societies having been able to come to an agreement.\n\nWell, ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Gaster has made a speech in which I recognize many of the features of speeches that I have made at this table on former occasions, but I am bound to say that I take a brighter view of our prospect with regard to the spread of Oriental studies than he does. It is quite true that the Statutory Commission have not thought fit to originate a School of Oriental Studies. Of course I do not know what the reasons were; whether it was that among the Statutory Commissioners there was no gentleman who represented Oriental Studies; that in itself in the constitution of the Statutory Commission, of course, constitutes a gap that might not have been avoided. In any case I feel confident that when the new Senate, which, as you all know, will ere long be appointed, enters upon its duties in organizing the new University, and when this Council place the case before the Senate in the sam\neloquent manner in which Dr. Gaster has put it before us just now, then I think that at last we shall awaken to our responsibilities as a great Eastern Power. At all events, in London we shall have a thorough recognition of the various Chairs which at present exist, but let me add that it will not be sufficient to organize a School unless we can persuade students to enter it. At present the worst feature of the situation is, not that Chairs do not exist, because, as you are aware, you have only to look at the programmes of University College and of King's College to discover that lectures are given on a great variety of Oriental subjects. But it is this, that when you ask who attend lectures on Pali or on Chinese, you are informed that there are one or two men, and in some cases you will be told that a Professor gives no lectures because there are no students. Well, that is undoubtedly a most lamentable state of things. There are various ways of correcting it. There is, of course, the Government, which in a great many directions in giving employment to officials can make the knowledge of these languages compulsory. In appointments of officials for the Indian, the Colonial, the Foreign Office Services in the East, the Government can raise the standard of requirements. There are a great many other means by which it might be done. As Dr. Gaster has already pointed out, in France there are numbers of students who are attending these lectures, and also in Berlin. Why are these studies vigorously prosecuted in countries with much smaller Oriental territories? And to what is due the disappointing fact that here the need does not seem to be felt for this branch of education? Are we to wait until we reap the disastrous results of neglecting them? That is unfortunately what too often happens in England; at a given moment something happens to reveal the fact that our rivals have overreached us, and why? Because they have forestalled us in training the men who defy our competition. Then there is an outburst of alarm in the country. I need not allude to present circumstances, as you are all aware of them. Then comes the cry, \"What has the Intelligence Department\nbeen about?\" I hope it will never be our fate in the East to be thus outwitted, but there are circumstances, to which I need not allude, which may any day reveal the fact that the ignorance of the language and customs of a certain tribe might give rise to friction or difficulties. Then of course the cry would be heard, \"Why are your officials not properly trained for the discharge of their duties?\" It is the same story all round, that what England, above all countries, with her great Empire wants in all directions is organization of its Intelligence Department, and I call this Oriental School, ladies and gentlemen, the Intelligence Department of your Eastern Empire. That is what you want to organize, and your great Eastern interests can never be safe until that Intelligence Department is placed on a regular and sound footing, and the public made aware of the use to which it is to be put. I hope on the next occasion I have to address you that Dr. Gaster and I will not have any reason to allude to this peril.\n\nA note has been put in my hand while I have been mentioning the illustrious dead: \"Did I forget to allude to Sir William Hunter?\" You will perhaps recollect that immediately after that sad news reached us, at one of our General Meetings, I expressed my sense of the great loss which Orientalism had suffered by the death of Sir William Hunter. I need not tell you that I am prepared to repeat what I said on that occasion as to how much I felt his loss personally. His death deprived the study of the history of India of one of its most eminent writers.\n\nThere is one very pleasing duty which still is incumbent on me. Probably no one is more aware of Professor Rhys Davids's services than I am, because no one relies more on his assistance than I do. I ask you to acknowledge the energy and the skill with which our valued Secretary discharges his duties to this Society. One of the most important works that this Society undertakes is the Journal, and its success is due entirely to Professor Rhys Davids and to the magnetism which he exercises on the contributors to the Journal. They have so great a belief in his powers of\nANNIVERSARY MEETING.\n\nediting the Journal that we are never without matter, and very often we have to reject articles which we should be glad to print. During the absence of Professor Rhys Davids\u2014and we were all delighted that he could enjoy that holiday, if holiday it was, because I need not tell you how active he was and how successful his travels have been\u2014Dr. Codrington has discharged the Secretary's duties with the greatest care. As to Miss Hughes, I can only repeat what I have said on many previous occasions\u2014and I am sure that Professor Rhys Davids would say the same\u2014that I do not know how we should get on without her. Whenever anyone comes here and wants to know anything about the Society, she is always ready to give information and to attend to our needs. I hope that our next Annual Meeting will be held under more favourable circumstances as regards India, and that we shall be able to congratulate ourselves on the fact that India has recovered from those two great calamities\u2014famine and plague. We know what an extraordinary recuperative power India displays. I hope also that the list of departed illustrious Oriental scholars will not be so large a one as it has been on this occasion.\n\nI beg to ask you whether you will agree to the adoption of the Report as printed.\n\n(Carried unanimously.)\n\nProfessor Rhys Davids: I have been asked by Mr. Wollaston, who is not here, to move in his name that the Council have just considered it expedient that a new edition of our rules should be prepared; and he has been asked to lay before this meeting the proposal that Dr. Thornton, Dr. Codrington, Mr. Brandreth, and Mr. Wollaston should be the Committee appointed to prepare such new edition and report to the next anniversary meeting of the Society.\n\nSeconded by Dr. Cust. (Carried.)\n\nProfessor Rhys Davids then read the draft of a deed which had been drawn up for the permanent administration of the Medal Fund. The draft was duly agreed to.\nJune 12.\u2014Sir Raymond West, Vice-President, in the Chair.\n\nIt was announced that\u2014\n\nMrs. Mond,\nMrs. Bullock Workman, and\nMr. W. W. Skeat\n\nhad been elected members of the Society.\n\nMr. M. Longworth Dames read a paper entitled \"Some New Gandh\u0101ra Sculptures,\" illustrated by lantern slides. A discussion followed, in which Mr. Kennedy, Sir Martin Conway, Professor Bendall, Dr. Hoey, and the Secretary took part.\n\nII. CONTENTS OF FOREIGN ORIENTAL JOURNALS.\n\nI.

OBITUARY NOTICE.\n\nWilliam Frederic Sinclair.\n\nWe regret to have to record the death of Mr. W. F. Sinclair, late Bombay Civil Service, on the 15th of May, in his 52nd year.\n\nHe was the son of Mr. William Sinclair, D.L., of Holly Hill, County Tyrone, and, after education at the Armagh Royal School, was appointed to the Indian Civil Service in 1866, and arrived at Bombay in 1868. He served through the usual course of grades in the Civil Administrative Ranks, until he became a Senior Collector in 1890 and was appointed to Thana. After holding that post until 1894 he came home and retired. It was whilst acting as Collector and Forest Settlement Officer of the Kolaba District in the eighties that Mr. Sinclair probably did his best work. Here he was in his right place: fond of the sea and all that is in or upon it, an ardent naturalist and student of flora and fauna, and with a lively interest in the hardy seafaring people of the coast, he became more than is usually the case personified\nwith that district, and there seemed to be nothing about the people, their languages and customs, about the trees and the birds and fishes, of which he had not some, if not full, knowledge. Amongst sailors, European and native, his work in connection with the Alibag lifeboats was well known and appreciated.\n\nSir James M. Campbell, K.C.I.E., who knew him well, is good enough to send the following notes:\u2014 \"When Mr. Sinclair was Collector of Kolaba, that is, the coast to the south of Bombay Harbour, the occurrence of more than one wreck showed that, in spite of the improved lighting of the entrance to Bombay, mistakes in dark stormy weather might still occur. The lifeboat and staff of Koli boatmen, which about twenty years before had more than once rendered good service, were maintained in little more than in name. Mr. Sinclair succeeded, mainly by gifts of his own and from his friends, in having an efficient lifeboat built and arrangements for the crew set in order. Mr. Sinclair was much attached to the Kolis, or local fishermen, whose skill and courage as seamen have been the admiration of most officers of the District who have been fond of the sea. With the help of the Kolis he worked at the subject of the salt-water fish of the District with such success as to send one of the best collections to the Fishery Exhibition in London. Besides of fish, Mr. Sinclair had a good knowledge of the animals, especially of the birds, of the parts of Western India in which he served. He was also fond of forest work, and was well acquainted with the forest trees of the Bombay Presidency.\n\n\"Place and personal names was a favourite study. On these subjects, and on caste and the daily life, religion, and customs of the Hindus of many portions of Western India, his knowledge was accurate and remarkable. On many of these subjects Mr. Sinclair contributed interesting and useful papers to the Indian Antiquary and other journals. Caves and old temples he studied with zeal, and made, perhaps, the most valuable district notes both for Khandesh and for Kolaba of the series which was afterwards embodied in the\n'Lists of Antiquarian Remains in the Bombay Presidency,' compiled by Dr. J. Burgess. Mr. Sinclair's writings did much to increase the knowledge regarding the Hem\u0101dpanti temples and the Ahir or Gauli dynasty of Khandesh. In writing, as in talk, Mr. Sinclair had a homely and humorous way of regarding all subjects which interested him. His style was clear and effective; and for a writer almost cut off from books he had an unusual command of slang or technique of many subjects on which he wrote.\"\n\nIn a notice of Mr. Sinclair in the Times of India the writer says: \"He had two hobbies. One was the lifeboat which he was instrumental in providing for Alibag, and which has been a blessing to the seafaring population along the coast. The other\u2014and no bad hobby either\u2014was the people of his district. Mr. Sinclair might best be described as a survival into our own days of the district officer of an earlier generation, who was more at home amongst his people than amongst his office files, trusting them and winning their trust, and knowing them better and caring more for them than the loquacious politicians who called him an alien, and pretended that they alone understood the riyot and his wants. It seems but the other day that he was ruling the Kolaba and afterwards the Thana District with a benevolent despotism which the people liked more perhaps than the Government.\"\n\nMr. Sinclair became a member of our Society in 1877, and sent several communications to the Journal. Many will feel his loss as of one to whom they could refer for information on many subjects with certainty of a ready and useful reply.\n\nDuring the last few months Mr. Sinclair was occupied much in translating and editing, in conjunction with Mr. Donald Ferguson, the \"Travels of Pedro Teixeira\" for the Hakluyt Society.\n\nO. C.\nIV. Notes and News.\n\nDr Alexander de Kegl requests us to publish the following additions and corrections to his communication printed above at p. 140:\n\nAdd:\n\nAfter the first line of the poem:\n\n\"\u0648\u064e\u0646\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064f \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627 \u0625\u0650\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064c \u0648\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0631\u064f \u0622\u0645\u064e\u062f\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u062e\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0631\u064f \u0634\u064e\u0645\u0650\u064a\u062f\u064f \u0630\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0648\u0652 \u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0631\u064e\u062c\u064e\u062d\u064f\u062a\u0652 \u0643\u064e\u0631\u0652\u062f\u064f \u0645\u064e\u0627\n\n\"As drunkards, licentious fellows, and cheats have we come.\n\nLike unto the atoms in the sunbeam our dust is encircling thee.\"\n\nIn the first line \u0637\u0627\u0644 is a misprint for \u0647\u0644\u0627\u0644; in the second, \u0633\u0628\u0648\u0627\u0631 is for \u0633\u0628\u0648\u0627\u0631.\n\nCorrect:\n\nIn the translation (p. 141), instead of \"We have come as the heroes of the mighty, powerful Creator,\" I would have it now \"We have come to go around by the order of the powerful Creator.\"\n\nInstead of \"We have come as the mind and soul of the turning sphere,\" is to be read \"As a soul have we come behind the turning vault.\"\n\n\"When it had become a curtain to us, the sun and the moon of the soul,\" is more correctly rendered by \"When our star had become the moon and sun of the soul.\"\n\n\"Facts and Fancies about Java,\" by Augusta de Wit (London: Luzac, 1899), is the title of a chatty and readable volume, with illustrations, on the social life and customs of this interesting island. There is nothing very new in this little work, which does not rise above the level of a traveller's account of his experiences. But it gives a number of interesting details and descriptions.\nFROM St. Petersburg comes the news of the death, on Thursday, May 10th, of the veteran Professor W. Wassiljew (Vasil'ev), many years Professor of Chinese in the University and member of the Imperial Academy of Sciences. Wassiljew's great work on Buddhism was written as long ago as 1856, but, being founded on original Tibetan and Chinese authorities, it retains its importance. This was translated into French and German. Amongst the chief of his other works are \"History and Antiquities of the Eastern portion of Central Asia\" (1857), \"Mohammedan Movement in China\" (1867), Manchurian Chrestomathy and Dictionary (1863-66), and \"Materials for a History of Chinese Literature\" (1887). Wassiljew was born in 1818 at Nijni Novgorod.\u2014From the Athen\u00e6um.\n\nAn interesting literary discovery is announced from Calcutta. Pandit Harapras\u0101da \u015a\u0101stri, of Presidency College, has recently received from Nepal a copy of a Sanskrit poem called \"R\u0101map\u0101lacarita.\" This narrates in the same words (more indic\u014d) by an elaborate chain of double entendre the exploits of the mythical hero R\u0101ma and of R\u0101map\u0101la, a member of the last Buddhist dynasty of India, who reigned in Bengal at the end of the eleventh century A.D. The discovery should prove to be of special value, as the P\u0101las are known only from a few inscriptions and colophons of MSS. and from scanty notices in Mohammedan chroniclers, mention of them in Indian literature having been as yet entirely wanting.\u2014From the Athen\u00e6um.\nGOLD MEDAL FUND.\n\nIn 1897 the Council of the Royal Asiatic Society established a Jubilee Gold Medal, to be awarded every third year, as an encouragement to Oriental learning amongst English-speaking people throughout the world; and to meet the expense contributions were invited from those interested in the scheme.\n\nA beautiful design was prepared, and dies engraved, by Mr. Pinches; the first Medal was awarded, on the report of a Committee of Selection, to Professor Cowell, and was presented to him by Lord Reay at a Special General Meeting of the Society, the proceedings of which will be found reported in the Journal for July, 1898.\n\nThe subscriptions (including interest on deposits) amounted to \u00a3338 15s. 10d., and the disbursements (including cost of die) to \u00a391 5s. 10d., leaving a balance (after providing the Medal for the present year) of \u00a3247 10s. 0d., of which amount \u00a3215 6s. 0d. was expended in the purchase of \u00a3200 Nottingham Corporation 3 per cent. Irredeemable Stock (a Trustee Stock), and there is therefore a sum in hand of \u00a332 4s. 0d. The amount invested forms the nucleus of an Endowment Fund; but as it is estimated that the cost of providing a Medal will amount to upwards of \u00a324, and as it is to be given every third year, the annual income required will be about \u00a38. To produce this another \u00a3100 Stock must be purchased, and the deficiency is therefore about \u00a370.\n\nIt is hoped that this amount will be forthcoming during the next few months, so that on the presentation of the Medal in the Summer of 1900 it may be announced that the entire sum has been raised.\n\nContributions, which will be acknowledged in the Society's Journal, will be received by the Secretary, or the Chairman of the Committee of the Medal Fund.\n\nA.

Gaster.\n\nAmong the tales that make up the well-known Kalilah and Dimnah cycle, or the Fables of Bidpai, there is one which has a history of its own. In the Syriac version published by Bickell, probably the oldest text available, it is called the \"Gate of Bilar\" (German translation, p. 93 ff.). In the Arabic recension, and in the Syriac which rests upon it, it is called similarly, \"The Story of the Wise Bilar.\" A full account of this text, together with an English rendering, has been given by I. G. N. Keith-Falconer (\"Kalilah and Dimnah,\" Cambridge, 1885, p. xxxi ff., 219 ff., and notes p. 301 ff.). By referring the reader to these \"notes\" I can dispense with any lengthy discourse on the history of this chapter within the frame of the Panchatantra. In one form or another it has travelled, together with the rest of the book, from one country to another, always forming an integral portion of it. The curious point about this chapter is, that hitherto no Sanscrit text of it has as yet come to light. The reason assigned for its disappearance has been, that it is of a pronounced Buddhist character and that a humiliating position is given to the Brahmans in this tale. The Brahmans, not being able to modify it by some\nslight eliminations, have suppressed it entirely. To Schiefner is due the merit of discovering a Tibetan counterpart of it, thus making the Indian origin and Buddhist character of the tale perfectly clear.\n\nThe discovery of this independent Tibetan version is of special value, for apart from the fact that it proves a Buddhist origin, it shows conclusively that this tale circulated also independently of the book. I have often contended in my folkloristic studies, that single tales have been detached from larger collections and have led a distinct and separate life of their own. Some enjoyed greater popularity and spread much farther than the others which remained in the collection and travelled only with it. They developed often in a strange way, being more directly subjected to the operation of popular imagination. They were adapted to suit local or temporal purposes, and were treated similar to the old apocryphal and pseudo-epigraphical writings. They were made to serve dogmatic purposes when this was the requirement of the hour, and had to submit to strange transformations. None, e.g., is more curious than the change which created a \"Barlaam and Josaphat\" legend. Christian elements were introduced and gave the Buddhist Jataka the character of one of the Vitae Sanctorum.\n\nThe same has happened to the chapter of the Panchatantra which I intend investigating in connection with the publication of the Rumanian version from an unique, though modern, manuscript. It will become evident that this tale must have been taken up at a very early period, by the same agency which transformed Buddha into Barlaam, and subjected to a similar transformation. For it is now a tale with a distinct eschatological tendency, whose purpose is to be a premonitory warning of the \"End of Days.\" The individual element has disappeared. The dreams seen by the king are no longer portents of coming good or evil as far as he personally is concerned, but warnings to the world on the things that are to be expected on the approaching period of the Last Days before the final Judgment takes place. From the time of the Sibyllinian\nOracles onwards more than one vaticination describing coming events appear in the Byzantine literature. They are mostly of Oriental origin, and are ascribed either to the prophet Daniel or to Bishop Methodius of Patare, to Leon the Philosopher, and to others (v. Krummbacher, \"Byzantinische Litteraturgeschichte,\" 2nd ed., p. 628 f.). These prophecies were introduced into other writings of a similar character, especially into descriptions of dreams. Nothing could serve the purpose of telling the future better than to connect them with dreams, which play so important a role in the Bible. The transition was therefore easy from a Buddhist series of dreams, and their personal interpretation, to a Christian similar series of dreams, but with a Christian eschatological interpretation. The framework was retained as the best vehicle for transmission; the miraculous and mysterious is always sure to appeal to the people, only the interpretation had to be changed to make this non-Christian book thoroughly orthodox.\n\nFollowing the example of Barlaam, we must look out for a Syriac and Greek text of these dreams, but none has yet been discovered. It may be that the attention now directed to this legend will help to stimulate a new search and will bring eventually such texts to light. Hitherto the \"Dreams\" were known only in Russia. Professor A. N. Vesselofsky, than whom there is no more competent scholar in that direction, has devoted a special study to the \"Twelve Dreams of Shahaisha,\" as they are called in Slavonic (\"Slovo o dv\u00e9naadtsati snah\u00fc Shahaishi,\" St. Petersburg, 1879). With his usual thoroughness he not only published a critical edition of a fifteenth-century text, but he goes into minute details concerning the history of this text, and the influence it has exercised upon Russian and mediaeval European literature. He finds traces of these dreams in the cycle of Solomonic legends, in the Quest of the Graal by Chrestien de Troyes, in other romances, and also in popular Russian tales. These dreams exist in Slavonic in at least two redactions, one a more modern and more enlarged in its eschatological element, found among the \"Raskolniki.\"\nthe general term used for heretical sects in Russia, and another somewhat shorter and evidently older. In both we find, however, already traces of the Prophecies of Methodius of Patara, one of the old Slavonic apocryphal books, and a remarkable similarity with the Tibetan version, inasmuch as this also partakes of the eschatological character in the interpretation of the dreams. In these Slavono-Russian MSS., of which a fairly good number is known, the name of the king is called, with slight variations, \"Shahinsha,\" and the philosopher who interprets the dreams, \"Mamer.\" Professor Vesselofsky sees in the former the Persian \"Shahinsha,\" \"the Emperor,\" and finds \"Mamer\" in \"Mor-olf,\" \"Memer-olt\" of the old German legend of Solomon (pp. 21, 22); and he concludes that the tale, for which no parallels are found in European literature, must have come to Russia straight from Asia, the same way as the tale of the Judge \"Shemyakin,\" whose peculiar cases and judgments sound like riddles. They form part of the Shylock cycle, and have been treated by me in my \"Beitraege zur vergleichenden Sagen und Maerchenkunde,\" 1883, p. 16 ff.\n\nBut a Slavonic text of the fifteenth century, though not yet found among the Southern Slavs, is of greater antiquity than anything yet which has been proved to be due in Russian directly to Oriental sources. The stories of Shemyakin are comparatively modern, whilst all the texts of a somewhat religious character rest ultimately on Byzantine originals. Whether these are forthcoming or not is merely a matter of chance. The negative argument that none are known to exist can at any time be upset by the discovery of such a missing text. We have a case in point in the story of Ahiqar and another in this very tale of the Dreams; for the discovery of a Rumanian text sets all doubts at rest. The old apocryphal Rumanian literature is based almost exclusively on South and Old Slavonic originals, which, as remarked, in their turn point to Greek sources. I had suspected the existence of a Rumanian version from a curt note of the late Canonicus\nCipariu (Gaster, \"Liter. pop. romana,\" p. 58), but short of seeing the MS. in question the surmise, based only on the title, could not be changed into a positive fact. Since the death of the owner the MS. has disappeared; may be it is now the property of the Rumanian Academy of Science and hidden away in their cellars, which have become the catacombs of Rumanian literature. Fortunately I learned from the Rev. Canonicus Voileanu, of Sibiu, in Transylvania, that he possessed a number of MSS. written in the last century by his forefather Voileanu, and with a liberality which it is a privilege to acknowledge here, placed them all at my disposal. Among these I discovered also the text of the twelve dreams, written in the year 1786. As all the MSS. written by Voileanu have proved to be copies of much older texts, I have no hesitancy to recognize in the present text a copy of a much older manuscript. In many places it is evidently corrupt. By comparing it with the old and with the more recent Slavonic, both published by Vesselofsky (loc. cit., pp. 4-13), the absolute similarity cannot be gainsaid. They are clearly derived from one old text common to all, which had its origin among the Slavonians of the South.\n\nThe Rumanian text is the shortest of the three, and in many instances more archaic even than the fifteenth-century Slavonic version. Noteworthy among the differences is the name of the king, who is called in Rumanian \"Sehachi,\" without a trace of the other form \"Shahaijah,\" due no doubt to later popular etymology. With the disappearance of this Persian form disappears also one of the most potent arguments of Professor Vesselofsky for the immediate Oriental origin of the Russian versions. I see further in the name \"Mamer,\" the philosopher, a corruption from the Syriac form \"Bilar,\" due by careless writing of the letters b and l in Syriac, or to the Byzantine transliteration \u03bc\u03c0\u03b9\u03bb\u03b1\u03c1 = Mpilar. A glance at K. Falconer's table (p. 303) will show how profoundly the names have been changed in the various versions of the Panchatantra.\n\nThe following is a faithful translation from the unique\nMS. of the Rumanian version, to which I have appended a carefully transliterated copy of the MS. written originally by Voileanu, with the old Slavonic letters in use in Rumania up to fifty years ago. The text has become a mystical treatise, and is called:\n\nA teaching concerning the End of Days.\n\n\"In a place called Vaihon there ruled a king called Sehachi. He once dreamed in a night twelve dreams, and there was none who could interpret them to him, until at last they found a man, by name Mamer, who was a great scholar and a philosopher. So he went to the king and said: 'My lord Sehachi, these dreams do not portend any evil concerning thee, but God has shown thee what will happen at the end of days. Tell me, then, what hast thou seen in thy first dream.' And the king replied: 'I have seen a golden pillar reaching from earth to heaven.' And Mamer replied: 'When the last days approach much evil will there be in the world. In that time justice will disappear and good thoughts, and no one will utter goodly words, only vile, and the old will become dotards, and all will fall into grave sins and not repent. There will be many famines, and the autumn will last all through the winter, and the winter will be prolonged beyond the middle of the summer; men will sow at all seasons, and one seed-time will miss the other (i.e. none will be at the proper time); they will sow much and reap little. At that time children will not respect their parents, and they will marry near relations (within the forbidden degrees), they will not beware of sin, and harlots will have children, not knowing who their fathers are. At that time kings and princes will act violently towards the poor. Many will forsake their faith and embrace another. The sun will get darkened, and the moon will not shine, the days will be short, and many signs will be seen. Priests will not be distinguishable from laymen, they will tell lies, and truth and justice will perish. This dream is an example for all!'\n\"The philosopher said: 'How was the second dream which thou didst dream, O king?' And the king said: 'I saw a woman holding in her hand a towel that reached from heaven to earth.' And the philosopher said: 'When the last days will be near the people will forsake their true faith and will begin to hold another, and no one will think of worshipping God. They will refuse to have any intercourse with their poor relations, and they will pass their time with strangers.'\n\n\"And the philosopher said: 'How was the third dream which thou didst dream?' And the king replied: 'I saw three kettles boiling over a big fire, one filled with fat, the other with water, and the third with oil; some of the fat was running into the oil and some of the oil into the fat, but none fell into the water, which boiled by itself alone.' The philosopher replied: 'At the end of days men will plant villages in places where such villages had never been thought of before, and at one end of the village a rich man will live and at the other another rich man, and all the poor will live in the middle. And the one rich man will invite the other to feast with him, but he will ignore all the poor, even if there be a brother among them. All will be hypocrites, they will neglect their own relations, they will hate their parents and brothers and love only the wife's family. Women will leave their husbands and will run away with other men. Old women will marry young men and old men will marry young girls, for then shame will have disappeared from among men, and there will not be found a single pure woman.'\n\n\"And the philosopher said: 'How was the fourth dream which thou didst dream?' And the king replied: 'I saw an old mare chewing some hay and the foal neighing within its belly.' The philosopher replied: 'When the end of days approaches mothers will act immodestly and join their daughters with strangers with whom they will closet them, and they will be shameless.'\n\n\"And the philosopher said: 'How was the fifth dream which thou didst see?' And the king said: 'I saw a bitch\nlying in a pond and the puppies were barking within her belly.' And the philosopher replied: 'During the last days fathers will teach their sons properly, but the sons will not listen, and will say, \"You have grown old and have lost your senses, and you do not know what you are talking about\"; and the parents will be put to shame, and will keep silent.'\n\n\"And the philosopher said: 'How was the sixth dream?' And the king replied: 'I saw a large number of priests standing in a mire up to their necks.' The philosopher replied: 'At the time of the end of days the priests will teach the people God's word, but they themselves will not observe it, and will only be gathering riches to themselves, and by this they will bring their souls to the everlasting fire.'\n\n\"And the philosopher said: 'How was the seventh dream?' And the king replied: 'I saw a beautiful horse with two heads, with one in front and the other at the back; with the first it fed upon the grass and with the second it drank water.' And the philosopher replied: 'When the end of days comes near they will deliver wrong judgment, accepting bribery, and the bishops will appoint ignorant priests\u2014a thing which ought not to happen\u2014only because they will be paid for it. There will be many priests, but few good among them; they will have neither fear of God, nor shame of men, and will not think that they will go down to the torment of hell.'\n\n\"And the philosopher said: 'How was the eighth dream?' And the king replied: 'I saw a quantity of pearls strewn upon the face of the earth, and fire fell from heaven and burned everything.' And the philosopher replied: 'At the end of days all will become traders, and the rich will make the poor out to be liars, and will take away by wrong means everything from the poor; by so doing they will lose their souls.'\n\n\"And the philosopher said: 'How about the ninth dream?' And Sehaicha said: 'I saw a large number of people working together in one spot.' And Mamer replied: 'At the end of days men will bring their riches\nand put into other people's keeping. They will receive them with love, but when they will be asked to return the riches they will deny it, and say: \"We do not know what you ask for, nor that you have left anything with us,\" even when the people will claim their property under oath. For doing which they will lose their souls.\"\n\n\"And the philosopher said: 'How about the tenth dream which thou didst see?' And the king replied: 'I saw a large number of men and women standing together upon the earth.' And the philosopher said: 'At the end of days people will practise trickery, and will pride themselves on it; by so doing they will lose their souls.'\n\n\"And the philosopher said: 'How about the eleventh dream?' And the king replied: 'I saw men wearing beautiful flowers on their heads.' And the philosopher said: 'At the end of days men will be slanderers and misers and libertines, and no word of truth will be found among them; brother will be cruel to brother, and if a poor man says anything wise they will all laugh at him, but if a rich man says however stupid a thing all will exclaim, \"Hark! that great man is speaking,\" and all will say, \"The master speaks well.\" For this they will go to the torment of hell.'\n\n\"And Mamer said: 'How about the twelfth dream which thou didst see?' And he replied: 'I saw a multitude of men with terrible eyes, and with wild (hard) hair, with nails like eagle's claws, and with long legs.' And Mamer said: 'At the end of days the rich will strangle the poor, and the poor will say, \"Happy those that have died before us, for they have not fallen upon such evil days.\"'\n\n\"Mamer, the philosopher, made then his obeisance before the king and said: 'I am the servant of you all, and I say again to you, my lord, that there will be great trouble at the end of days.'\"\n\nThus far the Rumanian version. The interpretation, in which the Rumanian agrees in the main with the Slavonic version, does apparently not fit in with the dreams. The\nincongruity between the image, as given by the dream, and\nthe interpretation, which ought to show some similarity,\ncan only be explained by the distance of time which\nseparates us from the original form. In the course of\ntransmission the interpretation, no longer corresponding\nwith any actual need or not answering any longer any\nimmediate dogmatic purpose, may have been changed almost\nbeyond recognition. An intimate connection between dream\nand interpretation must have existed originally. The Tibetan\nversion shows it clearly. In the change from a Buddhist\nto a Christian tale the eschatological character has been\nprofoundly modified, and we can now only here and there\nfind a trace of this connection. May be the dreams have\nalso been somewhat curtailed, which would increase the\ndifficulty of recognizing the relation between symbol and\ninterpretation. Older Greek and Oriental texts alone will\nsolve satisfactorily this problem.\n\n\u00cenve\u021b\u0103tur\u0103 la vr\u00eame de apoi.\n\nFost-ai \u00eentr-o cetate ce s\u0103 kema Vaihon un \u00eemp\u0103rat ce-l\nkema Sehaci, \u0219i au v\u0103zut \u00eentr'o noapte 12 visuri, \u0219i nu s\u0103\nafla nime s\u0103 le dezleg\u0103, dar\u0103 afla\u0219 un om ce-i era numele:\nMamer, \u0219i era c\u0103turator mare \u0219i filosof.

XXV.\u2014The Ris\u0101latu'l-Ghufr\u0101n: by Ab\u016b'l-'Al\u0101 al-Ma'arri. Summarized and partially translated by Reynold A. Nicholson.\n\nIn a recent number of the Journal (July, 1899, p. 671 seq.) I briefly described a manuscript, now in my possession, of the Ris\u0101latu'l-Ghufr\u0101n, and promised to give some further account of it at an early date. The work in question is mentioned by \u1e62afad\u012b\u00b9 and probably, as I have shown,\u00b2 by H\u0101ji Khalifa. Dhahabi, in his list of Ab\u016b'l-'Al\u0101's writings, includes it tacitly under the heading d\u012bv\u0101nu'l-ras\u0101'il, but he makes ample amends by setting it in the very forefront of his article on Ab\u016b'l-'Al\u0101,\u00b3 which begins:\n\n\u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0628\u0646 \u0633\u0644\u064a\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0633\u0644\u064a\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f\n\u0628\u0646 \u0633\u0644\u064a\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u062f\u0627\u0648\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0638\u0647\u0631 \u0628\u0646 \u0632\u064a\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0631\u0628\u064a\u0639\u0629 \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0646\u0648\u062d\u0649\n\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0631\u0651\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0637\u064a\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0639\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0634\u0647\u0648\u0631 \u0635\u0627\u062d\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0635\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0634\u0647\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0632\u0646\u062f\u0642\u0629\n\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0624\u0631\u062e \u0644\u0647 \u0631\u0633\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0641\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u062c\u0645\u0644\u0629 \u0642\u062f \u0627\u062d\u062a\u0648\u062a \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0632\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0648\u0625\u0633\u0646\u0627\u062f\n\u0641\u0641\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u062f\u0628 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631\n\nThe Ris\u0101la will be looked for in vain in the catalogues of European libraries,\u2074 though copies of it may perchance lie buried, like so much else, in the East.

I do not know Professor Margoliouth's reason for making it.\nbe considered a grave drawback, for, to quote the words of an eminent scholar, \"everyone who has the smallest acquaintance with Arabic MSS. knows how numerous are the mistakes which even the better class of copyists are prone to commit.\" The present MS. appears to be the work of three different hands. It is written, on the whole, with tolerable correctness and distinctness, except the last seventy or eighty pages, where one is continually reduced to more or less conjectural emendation. I do not say that a satisfactory text might not be established by a liberal expenditure of time and trouble. Those who have perused Ab\u016b'l-'Al\u0101's correspondence, lately edited by Professor Margoliouth, will appreciate the difficulty of such a task even for one thoroughly at home in the bewildering desert of Arabic antiquities, poetry, and philology. The author's style, especially in the rhymed passages, is highly allusive and artificial, and I am not foolish enough to suppose that my failure to understand is always due to an illegible or corrupt text. It would, of course, be the business of a competent editor to investigate and clear up these obscurities, however trifling, and not to shrink from any labour and research involved. But as my aim just now is merely to give a general view of the contents of the Ris\u0101la, I have felt myself free to evade points of little or no importance that did not yield to the first attack.\n\nAfter transcribing the Arabic text and making a rough translation, I found that the Ris\u0101la was divided into two parts, the former (pp. 4\u2013123) mainly of literary and philological interest, the latter (pp. 124\u2013219) embodying, along with much of the same kind, a somewhat discursive and anecdotal sketch of various heretics, freethinkers, false prophets, and pretenders to divinity, a race which has always flourished exceedingly within the titular boundaries of Isl\u0101m. Ab\u016b'l-'Al\u0101 himself was branded with heresy in his lifetime, though the charge was never pushed d'outrance. He was, in fact, more sceptic than heretic; there was\n\n---\n\n1 W. Wright, Opuscula Arabica, p. vi.\nnothing positive in his heresy, unless we broaden the term so as to make it include vegetarians and upholders of cremation. Judged, however, by the Mohammedan rule of orthodoxy, which weighs \"honest doubt\" and total unbelief in the same balance and finds them equally wanting, Ab\u016b'l-'Al\u0101 could not complain if his attitude towards accepted truth set up a minatory wagging of pious beards. What he thinks, therefore\u2014or rather, what he says\u2014about men like Husain b. Mans\u016br, Ibnu'l-R\u0101wandi, Bashsh\u0101r b. Burd, and others, while it cannot be regarded as finally significant of his real opinions, does at any rate afford the entertainment of a deft exhibition of skating over thin ice. It is needless to observe that the Ris\u0101la was in no sense a private and confidential document. Ab\u016b'l-'Al\u0101 often elucidates words and phrases which his learned correspondent must have known as he knew his A B C. The reason is quite obvious, and in one place Ab\u016b'l-'Al\u0101 expressly says (p. 124): \"You are far from requiring such an explanation, but I fear that this letter may fall into the hands of a dull youth in his teens, and that the word, being strange to him, may form a shackle and bring him to a dead stop.\" An audience thus contemptuously anticipated was not likely to be favoured with dangerous confessions.\n\nThe citations of verse are numerous and not very accurate. In the first part of the Ris\u0101la, as the nature of the subject would lead us to expect, these are derived almost entirely from the ancient poets. Generally a few verses only are cited, but occasional longer pieces chequer the narrative. As regards the anonymous verses, I decided not to attempt a systematic pursuit, which must have resulted in \"much cry and little wool,\" and though I have chanced upon some in the dictionaries, particularly in the Sah\u0101h\u012b, the number of missing authors is still considerable. Where the poet's name was mentioned, I turned to accessible editions or to the great anthologies. It seemed best, in a paper of this scope, to print only a small proportion of the verses cited, and in making a choice I have preferred, on the principle omne ignotum pro magnifico, either anonymous verses or those\nwhich I was unable to find in the ordinary collections. Thus I have printed nearly all the verses of 'Adi b. Zaid, A'sh\u0101 Kais, and Humaid b. Thaur, that are cited in the Ris\u0101la. Probably these extracts are in being elsewhere, but the div\u0101ns of 'Adi and Humaid are unknown, while al-A'sh\u0101's is preserved in a single manuscript in the Escorial.\n\nI have never altered the manuscript reading (save in cases of mere carelessness) without noting the alteration. There are several places in which I suspect, and a few in which I feel sure, that the text as it stands cannot be right, but I have usually left it untouched. Scientific emendation in any given Arabic poem must follow the comparative method so admirably illustrated by Ahlwardt in his Khalaf al-Ahmur's Qassida, that is to say, it must be grounded on a minute and exact knowledge of Arabic poetry. Possessing this knowledge, the critic can emend with a certainty that will hardly be attained in Latin or Greek, where he is not aided by the combination of precise detail and elaborate monotony which distinguishes the bards of the desert; not possessing it, he will, if he is wise, respect the written word.\n\nFor the vowel marks I am responsible; they are almost wholly absent from this MS.\n\nThe date of the Ris\u0101la is fixed at 424 A.H. by the following sentence, which occurs in a passage denying the possibility of prediction (p. 156):\n\n\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u062c\u0648\u0632 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062e\u0628\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u062e\u0628\u0631 \u0645\u0646\u0630 \u0645\u0627\u0626\u0629 \u0633\u0646\u0629 \u0623\u0646 \u0623\u0645\u064a\u0631 \u062d\u0644\u0628 \u062d\u0631\u0633\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0641\u064a \u0633\u0646\u0629 \u0623\u0631\u0628\u0639 \u0648\u0639\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0631\u0628\u0639 \u0645\u0627\u0626\u0629 \u0627\u0633\u0645\u0647 \u0641\u0644\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0646 \u0641\u0644\u0627\u0646 \u0648\u0635\u0641\u062a\u0647 \u0643\u0630\u0627 \u0641\u0625\u0646 \u0623\u062f\u0639\u0649 \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0645\u062a\u0639\u062a \u0646\u0627\u062b\u0645\u0627 \u0647\u0648 \u0645\u062a\u062e\u0631\u062c \u0643\u0627\u0630\u0628\n\nOther facts support this date. E.g. Shiblu'l-Daula is mentioned (p. 62) in a context which implies that he was governor of Halab at the time when the Ris\u0101la was written. Now Shiblu'l-Daula became governor in 420 and died in 429.\n\nConcerning the person to whom the Ris\u0101la is addressed, Ab\u016b'l-'Al\u0101 gives us little information. His full name is\n'Ali b. Mans\u016br b. T\u0101lib al-\u1e24alab\u012b (p. 62), and his kunya Ab\u016b'l-\u1e24asan (p. 123). He had travelled in \u1e6cr\u0101k and Egypt, and when Ab\u016b'l-'Al\u0101 wrote had recently arrived in Aleppo.

I believed in God Almighty, and I saw, as in a dream, a rope let down from heaven, and those of the dwellers on earth who clung to it were saved.

Al-A'sh\u0101 retorted by a bitter tirade against wine, whereupon N\u0101bigha rose in high dudgeon as if to depart. The Shaikh, wishing to restore his good-humour, proposed that he should take one of the goose-maidens home with him, but this plan was upset by Labid, who pointed out that the precedent might be followed, and all Paradise would ring with the news thereof, and they would be nicknamed \"husbands of the geese.\"\n\n[Page 50] Now Hassan b. Th\u0101bit came along, and the Shaikh invited him to drink, quoting his lines:\n\n\u0661 \u0645\u0633. \u062d\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0651\u0649 \u0623\u064e\u0646\u062a\u064e \u0644\u0646\u0627.\n'Twere not you ashamed,' said he, 'to introduce a topic like this in your eulogy of the Apostle of God?' Hassan replied: 'He was more easy-tempered (\u0623\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0633\u0650\u062d\u064f\u0651) than ye imagine. Besides, I only speak of wine at second hand; I do not say that I ever drank it, and I am not [P. 51] guilty on that score.' Then the Shaikh put some grammatical questions, but before he got a reply one of the company said to Hassan: 'How of your cowardice, O father of 'Abdu'l-Rahm\u0101n?' 'Is this taunt addressed to me,' he cried, 'whose tribe is the bravest of the Arabs?' Six of them resolved to attack the pilgrims (\u0623\u064e\u0647\u0652\u0644\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064f\u0631\u0652\u0633\u0650\u0645), and they covenanted with the Prophet to make war upon all recalcitrants, and Rabi'a and Mudar and all the Arabs shot at them with the bow of hostility and bore a deadly hatred against them. If at times I showed caution, it was dictated by prudence, in order that I might rally or execute a strategic retreat' (Kor., viii, 16).\n\nThen the party broke up after a sitting that had lasted the space of many mortal lives. And as the Shaikh was strolling through the fields of Paradise, he met five men mounted on camels. These were the one-eyed men of Kais (\u0639\u064f\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e \u0642\u0650\u064a\u0633), namely, Tam\u012bm b.

The Shaikh begged Shamm\u0101kh to recite his poems rhymed in z and j, as he wanted information on certain points, but Shamm\u0101kh declared that he could not remember a single verse. The Shaikh rebuked him, saying that these poems had made him famous and were more profitable to him than his two daughters, just as N\u0101bihga's poem stood him in better stead than his daughter 'Akrab, who disgraced him and was taken captive, and was the cause of gifts being withheld from him. Then the Shaikh offered to recite Shamm\u0101kh's poem in z, which begins:\n\n\\[ \\text{\u0639\u0641\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0633\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u062a\u064f \u0628\u064e\u0637\u0650\u0646\u064e \u0642\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0628\u0650\u064a} \\]\n\\[ \\text{\u0646\u0630\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0646\u0627 \u0641\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0634\u0631\u0641\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0648\u0627\u0634} \\]\n\nBut he found that Shamm\u0101kh did not understand it, for the delights of Paradise had weaned him from all vanities. 'I only followed the profession of poet,' said Shamm\u0101kh, 'in hope of getting the loan of a she-camel for riding or the present of a scanty measure of grain to feed my family in a year of drought,' as the r\u0101'iz says:\n\n\\[ \\text{\u0644\u0648 \u0634\u0627\u0643 \u0645\u0646 \u0631\u0623\u0633\u0643 \u0639\u0638\u0645 \u064a\u0627\u0628\u0633} \\]\n\\[ \\text{\u0622\u0644 \u0645\u0646\u0643 \u062c\u0645\u0644 \u062d\u0645\u0627\u064a\u0634} \\]\n\n1 The notice in the Aghl\u0101ni throws no light upon this allusion.\n2 Probably v in Alhw\u0101rdi's The Div\u0101n is meant, which by some was reckoned among the Mu'allak\u0101t.

Ahmad.\nrejected by the school of Ba\u1e63ra, that the dal in \u0635\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0645\u0652 is superfluous.' Then God inspired Ibn Ahmar, and he said: 'Why should you refuse to rank \u0632\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u062f\u064e and \u0631\u064e\u062c\u064e\u0631\u064e under one root? The verb \u0632\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u062f\u064e is formed from \u0632\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u062f\u064e, because no verb can have five radical letters; from this again is formed a noun \u0632\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u062f\u064e. You are aware that the diminutive of \u0632\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u062f\u064e [P. 56] is \u0632\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u062f\u064e, and the plural \u0632\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u062f\u064e, yet this does not prove the superfluity of the k\u0101f.' 'Your hypothesis,' answered the Shaikh, 'implies that the verb is prior to the noun.' 'Amr demurred to this statement, and argued the question at some length. As the Shaikh found that little information was to be got from him, he said: 'Which of you is Tamim b. Ubayy? Explain to me your verse:\n\n\u064a\u0627 \u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0633\u0644\u0645\u064a \u062e\u0644\u0627 \u0644\u0627 \u0623\u0643\u062a\u0646\u0647\u0627\n\u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0646\u0629 \u062d\u062a\u0649 \u062a\u0633\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0646\u064a\u0627\n\nWhat did you mean by \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0646\u0629?

'I did not bring with me to Paradise,' said Tamim, 'an atom of poetry or rajaz, for I had to undergo a severe reckoning, and I was charged with having fought against \u2018Ali b. Abi \u1e6calib, and al-Najashi al-H\u0101rithi confronted me, ere I escaped from the fire, and dragged me several times by the forelock.'\n\nHere begins a long narrative by the Shaikh of his experiences in the place of Judgment. It may be abridged without much loss to the reader.\n\n'I remembered,' said he, 'the verse (Kor., lxx, 4), \"The angels ascend unto Him, and the Spirit (Gabriel) also, in a day whose space is 50,000 years,\"' and the term seemed\n\n1 Also \u062a\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u0642 (Wright's Arabic Grammar, i, 168).\n2 MS. \u0646\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0627.

Now I am a man quick to thirst (\u062c\u0650\u0639\u064e\u0627\u0641), so I considered and perceived 'twas a matter one like me could not withstand. The Recording Angel brought me my book of good deeds, and lo! my merits were few as grassy meadows in a year of drought, albeit repentance and the close resembled the lamp of the Christian monk that beacon aloft for him who threads his way through a watery course.' The Shaikh goes on to relate how he sought favour with Ridwan and another guardian of Paradise called Zufar, by composing laudatory verses in every metre capable of being rhymed with their names, but they remained inflexible. Then he saw a man crowned with an aureole in the midst of a resplendent entourage. This was Hamza b. 'Abdu'l-Muttalib and the Moslems slain at Ohod. 'And I said to myself: \"Poetry is better laid out on him than upon the guardians of Paradise, for he is a poet, and so are his brothers, and his father, and his grandsire. Methinks, there is no security for me between him and Ma'add b. 'Adn\u0101n.\" Accordingly the Shaikh composed a poem in the style of the verses by Ka'b b.

Do not abuse the old man. He may put forward as a plea for your consideration [P. 62] his book on the Kor\u02be\u0101n, entitled al-Hujja. He never shed your blood nor took your property. Pray, leave him in peace.\" While I was engaged in addressing them and expecting their answer, the scroll, in which mention was made of my repentance, slipped from my hand, and when I returned to seek for it, I could not find it.\n\n\u02bfAli, seeing the Shaikh's consternation and distress, said: 'Never mind! Have you any witness to your repentance?' 'Yes,' said he, 'I have \u02bfAbdu'l-Mun\u02bfim b. \u02bfAbdu'l-Karim,\n\n1 Yazid b. al-Hakam al-Thakafi (Agh\u0101ni, xi, 100 sqq.).\n2 Agh\u0101ni, xi, 105.\n3 For \u0645\u0642\u062a\u0648\u0649 see Amr's Mu\u02bfallaqa, 56, and N\u00f6ldeke, F\u00fcnf Mu\u02bfallaqen, p. 41.\n4 Cited in the Sahih under \u0630\u0646\u062b\u0647 \u0630\u0646\u062b\u0647.\nKadi of Aleppo and of its public officials (\u0627\u0644\u062f\u064e\u0651\u0627\u0631\u0650\u064a\u064f\u0651\u0648\u0646\u064e) in the time of Shiblu'l-Daula.' Then 'Ali ordered a h\u0101lif to cry out in the place of Judgment: 'O 'Abdu'l-Mun'im (giving his full name), have you any knowledge of the repentance of 'Ali b. Mans\u016br b. T\u0101lib al-Halab\u012b, the scholar?' None answered, and the Shaikh was seized with fear and trembling. Then he cried out a second time, but there was no response, and the Shaikh fell prostrate on the ground (\u0641\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0645\u0652 \u064a\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0642\u064e\u0649). At the third summons, however, a voice answered: 'I was present at the repentance of 'Ali b. Mans\u016br, late in his life (\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064b\u0627 \u062e\u064e\u0631\u064e\u062c\u064e \u0645\u0650\u0646\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0642\u0652\u062a\u0650). It took place in my house, and was witnessed by a number of assessors.' Thereupon the Shaikh, having come to his senses, stood up and implored 'Ali to admit him to Paradise. But 'Ali turned his back on him, saying, 'Verily thou seekest a thing hard, impossible' (\u062c\u064e\u062f\u064b\u0651\u0627 \u0645\u064e\u0639\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0646\u0650). In his despair the Shaikh approached the kin of the Prophet, entreating them to demand the intercession of F\u0101\u1e6dima, when she came forth [P. 63] from Paradise, as she does every day, to greet her father, who is a spectator of the Judgment. So when F\u0101\u1e6dima appeared, they urged his petition, and she handed him over to her brother Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, and since his name was found with the seal of repentance in the D\u012bv\u0101nu'l-A'\u1e93am, the Prophet interceded for him.\n\nNow he came to al-Sir\u0101t, and F\u0101\u1e6dima bade one of her girls take him across (for by himself he was unable), and she advanced, outstripping him as he swayed unsteadily to and fro. 'O damsel,' said he, 'if you desire to save me, practise with me the saying of the poet:\n\n[\u0628\u064a\u062a \u0625\u0646 \u0623\u0639\u064a\u0627\u0643 \u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a]\n\n[P. 65]\n\n\u0641\u064e\u0627\u062d\u0645\u0644\u064a\u0646\u064a \u0632\u064e\u0642\u064e\u0641\u064f\u0648\u0646\u0647\n\n'What is it?' said she. 'It means,' replied the Shaikh, 'that a man throws his arms over the shoulders of another, who takes hold of his hands and carries him with his belly\nresting on the bearer's back. Have you not heard the lines of al-Jahj\u016bl of Kafart\u0101b? \n\n\u0635\u0644\u0649\u062a \u062d\u0627\u0644\u064a\u062a\u064a \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0644\u0642 \u062d\u062a\u0649 \n\u0645\u0631\u062a \u0623\u0645\u064a \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0631\u0649 \u0632\u0642\u0641\u0648\u062a\u0647\n\n'No,' said she, 'I never heard of Zqfowt, or of al-Jahj\u016bl, or of Kafart\u0101b.' Then she bore him across al-Sir\u0101t like a flash of lightning, and F\u0101\u1e6dima said: 'We give you this girl to be your handmaid in Paradise.' 'My stay in the place of Judgment,' said the Shaikh in conclusion, 'lasted only one year, and on this account my memory is unimpaired.'\n\n[P. 66] Then, after a brief parley with R\u0101'\u012bl-Ibil, the Shaikh accosted Humaid b. Thaur. 'O Humaid,' said he, 'you have excelled in your verse:'\n\n\u0623\u0631\u0649 \u064a\u064f\u0628\u064e\u0631\u0650\u0651\u064a \u0642\u062f \u0631\u0627\u0628\u0646\u064a \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0635\u062d\u064a\u062d\u0629 \n\u0648\u062d\u0633\u0628 \u062f\u0622\u0621 \u0623\u064a \u062a\u0635\u062d \u0648\u062a\u0633\u0644\u0645\u0627\n\nHow is your sight now?'

Hence I am what you see.' 'And I,' said [P. 78] the other, 'am Taufik al-Saud\u0101'. I was a servant in the Academy at Baghd\u0101d in the time of the Keeper Ab\u016b Mans\u016br Mu\u1e25ammad b. \u2018Ali,\u2019 and I used to fetch books for the copyists.'\n\nAfter this the Shaikh, wishing to satisfy his curiosity concerning the creation of houris, was led by an angel to a tree called 'The Tree of the Houris,' which was laden with every sort of fruit. 'Take one of these fruits,' said his guide, 'and break it.' And lo! there came forth therefrom a maiden with large black eyes, who informed the Shaikh that she had looked forward to this meeting four thousand years ere the beginning of the world. . . .\n\n[P. 79] Now the Shaikh was fain to visit the people of the Fire, and to increase his thankfulness for the favour of God by regarding their state, in accordance with His saying (Kor., xxxvii, 49\u201355). So he mounted one of the horses of Paradise and fared on. And after a space he beheld cities crowned with no lovely light, but fall of catacombs and dark passes. This, an angel told him, was the garden of the \u2018Ifr\u012bts who believed in Mu\u1e25ammad and are mentioned in the S\u016bratu'l-A\u1e25k\u0101f and in the S\u016bratu'l-Jinn. And lo! there was an old man seated at the mouth of a cave. Him the Shaikh greeted and got a courteous answer. 'I have come,' said he, 'seeking knowledge of [P. 80] Paradise and what may perchance exist among you of the poetry of the M\u0101rids.' 'Surely,' said the greybeard, 'you have hit upon one acquainted with the bottom of the matter, one like the moon of the halo, not like him who burns the skin by filling it with hot butter.' Ask what you please.'\n\n1 Letter xix (ed. Margoliouth) is addressed to this person.\n\nThere is a play on \u062d\u0627\u062a\u0646, which also means 'a decumbent moon.'\nWhat is your name? 'I am Khaishaf\u016bdh,' one of the Ban\u016b Sha\u1e63ab\u0101n; we do not belong to the race of Iblis, but to the Jinn, who inhabited the earth before the children of Adam.' Then the Shaikh said: 'Inform me concerning the poetry of the Jinn; a writer known as al-Marzub\u0101n\u012b has collected a good deal of it.'\n\n'All this is untrustworthy nonsense,' rejoined the old man. 'What do men know about poetry, save as cattle know about astronomy and the dimensions of the earth? They have only fifteen kinds of metre, and this number is seldom exceeded by the poets, whereas we have thousands that [P. 81] your litt\u00e9rateur never heard of.'\n\nNow the Shaikh's enthusiasm for learning made him say to the old man, 'Will you dictate to me some of this poetry? In the transitory world I occupied myself with amassing scholarship, and gained nothing by it except admittance to the great. From them, indeed, I gained pigeon's milk in plenty, for I was pulling at a she-camel whose dugs were tied.'\n\nWhat is your kunya, that I may honour you therewith?'

'In the past world,' said he, 'we received the power of transformation, and one of us might, as he wished, become a speckled snake or a sparrow or a dove, but in the next world we are deprived of this faculty, while men are clothed in beautiful forms. Hence the saying, \"Man has the gift of hila and [P. 82] the Jinn that of haula.\" I have suffered evil from men, and they from me.' Ab\u016b Hadrash then related how he struck a young girl with epilepsy, 'and her friends gathered from every quarter and summoned magicians and physicians and lavished their delicacies, and left no charm untried, and the leeches plied her with medicines, but all the time I never budged (\u0648\u064e\u0625\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0643\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0644\u064e\u0627 \u0623\u064e\u0632\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0644\u064f).

The final exhortation to repentance was like a spur (he says) to a willing steed:\n\nThe Shaikh marvelled at what he heard from this Jinni, but would not stay with him longer, so he farewelled him and went on his way. After meeting the lion which devoured \u2018Utba b. Abi Lahab and the wolf which wounded the Aslamite in the Prophet\u2019s time, he came to a tent like the hut of a shepherdess (\u0643\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e\u062a\u0652 \u062c\u0650\u0641\u0652\u0634\u064e \u0623\u064f\u0645\u064e\u0651 \u0631\u064e\u0627\u0639\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0629). Inside was a man who lacked the aureole of the people of Paradise, and hard by grew a sorry bush with scentless fruit. \u1e24u\u1e6dai\u2019a (for it was he) told the Shaikh that intercession was made for him on account of his sincerity in the verses:\n\n\u2018Were you not pardoned,\u2019 said the Shaikh, \u2018for the lines?\u2014\n\nThe proverb is \u0643\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e\u062a\u0652 \u0644\u064e\u0648\u0652 \u0644\u064e\u0627 \u0642\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0644\u064e\u062a\u0652 (Freytag, Arabum Proverbia, ii, 309).\n\nI cannot explain this allusion.\n\nCited in Rau\u1e0datu\u2019l-Adab, p. 85, where it is said that \u1e24u\u1e6dai\u2019a in his perplexity repeated the first couplet several times until he happened to catch sight of his own face in a pond.\n'No,' said he, 'the idea had been expressed by righteous men before me, and I did not practise what I preached.' Then the Shaikh asked for Zibrik\u0101n b. Badr, and \u1e24u\u1e6d\u0101i said: 'He is a chieftain in this world as in the last; I profited by my satire when others failed to profit by my praise.'\n\nLeaving him, the Shaikh passed on, and as he approached the place which commands a view of Hell-fire (\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u062a\u0642\u0649 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0631), he saw al-Khans\u0101 of Sulaim, who said: 'I wished to behold Sakhr, so I clambered up and saw him like a lofty peak with fire blazing on its summit. And he said to me, \"Your words have come true,\" meaning my verse\u2014\n\n\u0648\u064e\u0625\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u0635\u064e\u062d\u064e\u0631\u064e \u0644\u064e\u0627 \u062a\u064e\u0623\u0652\u0645\u064f\u0631\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0647\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0627\u064a\u064e\u0627 \u0628\u0650\u0647\u0650\n\u0643\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0643\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0641\u0650\u064a \u0631\u064e\u0623\u0652\u0633\u0650 \u0646\u064e\u0627\u0631\u064d\n\nThen the Shaikh ascended and introduced himself to Iblis, who was suffering horrible tortures. 'My profession,' said he, 'was that of a scholar.' 'A bad profession,' rejoined Iblis; 'though it may afford a bare livelihood, it brings no comfort to one's family, and surely it makes the feet stumble. How many like thee hath it destroyed!'

'Surely,' said 'Alkama, 'you are seeking smiles from one who is sad, and are wishing to double up the dates when they are dry.' Mind your business, O saved one!' The Shaikh said: 'If sincere verses containing no praise of God could intercede for any, your verses describing women would have interceded for you.

May her shoulder be too weak to bear his weight! But alas! men come to Judgment naked, barefooted, without provision. This is the same cast-off camel that is mentioned in your verse (Mu'allaka, 14).\n\nThen the Shaikh departed to converse with Tarafa, and quoted his verse (Mu'allaka, 47), which, said he, is attributed by some to 'Adi b.

'A false criticism,' cried Mu\u1e25alhil: 'this verse was spoken by one who had a sound knowledge of idiom, either me or another. Hold fast to it and turn your back on foolish sayings.' Then the Shaikh approached al-Murakkish al-[P. 111] Akbar, and said: 'God give you ease, O injured youth!

On the way\nhe met Adam, and fell into a discussion of some verses,\u00b9 the authorship of which Adam vehemently denied; and, [P. 115] advancing further, he came to a delectable garden where snakes were gambolling and balancing themselves in the water. He marvelled that snakes should exist in Paradise, but God Almighty inspired one of them with knowledge of what was passing through his mind, and it said: \u2018Did you never hear of Dh\u0101tu-l-Saf\u0101, who paid her friend in his own coin?\u2019\u00b2\n\n[P. 117] After listening to her tale, the Shaikh conversed with another snake who had lived in the house of \u1e24asan al-Bagri and learned the whole Kor\u0101n from his dictation. He asked her whether the tradition was correct that \u1e24asan used to read \u0641\u064e\u0625\u0650\u0630\u064e\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0623\u064e\u0633\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0627\u062d (Kor., vi, 96).

When Ab\u016b \u2018Amr died, I went to K\u016bfa and dwelt with Hamza b. Habib, and from him I heard several readings\u00b3 abominated by Arabic scholars. . . . This is to lock the door of Arabic idiom (\u0625\u063a\u0644\u0627\u0642 \u0644\u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629).

'Will [P. 119] you not stay awhile with me?' she continued. 'I can split my skin whenever I please, and become as lovely a lady as there is in Paradise.' But he moved away at a quick pace, muttering to himself: 'How should one incline to a snake whose excellence is poison and her purpose a sudden attack?' And as he fared on his way he met the [P. 120] damsel who had come forth from the fruit, and they glided through the sand-hills together. She quoted some verses\\(^2\\) of Imru\u02beu\u02bel-Kais, which reminded the Shaikh of\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Mutanakkhil b. \u1e62Uwaimir.

And he came to some tents which had not the height and spaciousness of the tents in Paradise. It was the Garden of the Rajaz-makers.

The tradition is verified that God loves lofty things and loathes the mean,\u00b3 for rajaz is a mean sort of verse. O men, scanty was your accomplishment and scanty is your reward!'\n\nNow he met Ru'b\u0101 and abused him for rhyming with 'abhorrent letters,' such as \u064e and \u0650 and \u0652, adding that he never coined a well-known proverb or a classic phrase.

In the past world you would plume yourself on the interpretation of a word which these savants handed down to you as coming from me and my fellows.' Ru'b\u0101's arrogance did not escape the Shaikh, who said: 'If your rajaz and your father's rajaz were poured into one mould, it would be impossible to extract therefrom a single poem of excellence.

XXVI.\u2014Biographies of Persian Poets contained in Ch. V, \u00a7 6, of the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-Guzida, or \"Select History,\" of \u1e24amd\u016bll\u0101h Musta\u1e63fi of Qazvin. Translated by EDWARD G. BROWNE, M.A., M.R.A.S.\n\nIn pursuance of the plan set forth in my article on the Sources of Dawlatsh\u0101h (J.R.A.S. for Jan., 1899, pp. 37\u201369), I propose in this place to give a translation of that section (the sixth of the fifth chapter) of the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-Guzida which treats of the Persian poets. On the importance of that excellent historical manual, which I hope to include in my Persian Text Series, I have already insisted in the above-mentioned article (pp. 39, 40, and 53\u201354); and of this particular section, to which my attention was especially directed by the references made to it by Dawlatsh\u0101h, I long ago prepared a text and translation. These I was more than once on the point of publishing, but certain difficulties remained, on each revision, insoluble; and I waited in the hope of obtaining further material or fuller light. Of these difficulties the chief were the so-called \"Pahlavi\" (i.e. dialect) verses of Abu'l-Majid R\u0101yag\u0101n\u012b, U'y\u0101nj or U'tanj, J\u016bl\u0101ha of Abhar, 'Izzu'd-D\u012bn Humad\u0101ni, K\u0101fi-i-Karaji, and other poets, who, not content with the classical language, chose to employ the dialects of their native places as the vehicle of their thoughts. These dialects have, in most cases, either become extinct, or undergone great changes, since the time when the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-Guzida was written (A.H. 730 = A.D. 1330); and since we possess but little knowledge of them, while such fragments as are preserved have generally been hopelessly mutilated and corrupted by a succession of scribes, copying one from another, to whom they were as unintelligible as they are to us, there is but\nlittle hope that we shall ever arrive at a complete understanding of them.\n\nNow it is always humiliating to publish texts which one is unable to understand or explain, and of which one cannot guarantee the correctness; yet since these enigmatical verses constitute but a small proportion of the section of the Guzida which I wish to render accessible to other students of Persian literature, and since the existence of so much dialect-poetry in Persia in the Middle Ages is an interesting and important fact, and one deserving further attention, I have finally decided to publish my work, hoping that others may be more fortunate than myself in the explanation of these dark sayings. I have, of course, collated all the older manuscripts to which I had access in these portions, and I owe especial thanks to Baron Rosen, of St. Petersburg, who, with his usual kindness, has copied and transmitted to me the texts of these verses as they occur in the MS. of the Guzida, dated A.H. 847, belonging to the Mus\u00e9e Asiatique; and in that of the Institut des Langues Orientales (No. 260: No. 6 of Baron Rosen's Manuscrits Persans de l'Institut, p. 52), dated A.H. 855.\n\nMy original intention was to publish the entire text of this section with a translation, but on maturer thought it appeared to me that it would be sufficient to include in my English rendering the text of the verses cited, the more so because, as I have said, I intend, if possible, to print the text of the whole book in my Persian Text Series. Some few of the verses cited, apart from the unintelligible dialect-verses of which I have just spoken, are so coarse that I have left the text untranslated; otherwise the translation is as complete as I could make it, and represents the fullest text that I have been able to reconstruct from the manuscripts at my disposal; for in most manuscripts there are some lacun\u00e6, while in some the whole section is unfortunately wanting. At best, however, it bears evident traces of having lacked a final revision by the author; since the gaps after such expressions as \"his name was . . . . . .,\" \"he was a contemporary of . . . . . .\"\nand the like, are common to all the manuscripts, save where, for the sake of concealing these defects, the scribe has suppressed these and similar uncompleted sentences. I should add that some biographies of Persian poets, who were also saints (like San\u0101'\u012b of Ghazna and Aw\u1e25adu'd-D\u012bn of Kirm\u0101n) or men of science (like Avicenna and Abu'l-Fa\u1e6d\u1e25 of Bust), are given in the earlier sections of this fifth chapter, which deals with biography in general. These are not included in my translation.\n\nThe chief sources of the Guzida, enumerated in the Preface, are as follows:\u2014(1) Siyaru'n-Nabi (presumably Ibn \u1e24ish\u0101m); (2) Qis\u0101\u1e63u'l-Anbiy\u0101 (probably the work of that name by ath-Tha'alib\u012b); (3) the Ris\u0101la of al-Qushayri; (4) the Tadzkiratu'l-Awliy\u0101 (probably Faridu'd-D\u012bn 'Att\u0101r's); (5) the Tudbein (probably the work properly entitled Raw\u1e0du'r-Riy\u0101\u1e0din) of al-Y\u0101fi'i; (6) the Tajd\u012bbu'l-umam (probably the work of Ibn Miskawayh); (7) the Mash\u0101ribu't-Tajd\u012bb (see H\u00e1ji Khalifa, No. 12,043); (8) D\u012bd\u0101nu'n-Nasab; (9) Tabar\u012b; (10) Hamza of Isfah\u0101n; (11) Ibn'u'l-Ath\u012br; (12) the Zubdatu't-Ta'v\u0101rikh of Jam\u0101lu'd-D\u012bn Abu'l-Q\u0101sim of K\u0101sh\u0101n; (13) the Nidh\u0101mu't-Ta'v\u0101rikh of al-Baydaw\u012b; (14) the 'Uyinu't-Ta'v\u0101rikh of Ab\u016b T\u0101lib 'Ali al-Kh\u0101zin al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b; (15) Ibn Qutayba's Kit\u0101bu'l-Ma'\u0101rij; (16) Juwayni's Jah\u0101n-Kush\u0101; (17) Ab\u016b Sharaf Jarb\u0101dh\u0101q\u0101n\u012b's translation of al-'Uthb\u012b's monograph on Sult\u0101n Mahm\u016bd the Ghaznavid; (18) the Nidh\u0101mu'l-Mulk's Siyaru'l-Mul\u0101k (that is, the Siyasat-n\u0101ma: see J.R.A.S. for Jan., 1899, p. 41, No. 24); (19) the Sh\u0101hn\u0101ma of Firdaws\u012b; (20) the Saljuq-n\u0101ma of Dhahiri of Nish\u0101p\u016br; (21) the Majma'-i-Arb\u0101bu'l-Mulk of Q\u0101di Ruknu'd-D\u012bn of Kh\u016by; (22) the Istidh\u0101hiru'l-akhl\u0101r of Q\u0101di Al\u1e25mad of D\u0101mg\u0101n; (23) the Jam\u012b'u't-Ta'v\u0101rikh of the author's \"martyred master\" Rashidu'd-D\u012bn.\n\nThe arrangement and contents of the Guzida are in brief as follows:\u2014\n\nIntroduction. On the Creation and Disposition of the Universe.\nChapter I. On the Prophets, Religious Leaders and Wise Men who worked for the guidance of mankind before the time of Mu\u1e25ammad, in two sections: (i) Prophets, ordinary and extraordinary; (ii) Philosophers and Sages.\n\nChapter II.

We shall, however, mention the names of such as are most famous, citing in some cases a few of their verses.\n\n1. Anwari.\n\nAwhadu'd-Din al-Kh\u00e1var\u00e1ni was the contemporary and panegyrist of Sult\u00e1n Sanjar the Salj\u00faq [A.H. 511\u2013552].\nHe had some knowledge of most branches of science, as is shown by this fragment:\n\n\"Though I have simultaneously closed the doors of panegyric and ode, do not suppose that I am deficient in [the power of] arranging words and ideas.\n\nNay, in every science known to any of my contemporaries, whether pure or applied, I am competent.\"\n\n1 This poem is given in full on pp. 704-5 of the Lakhnaw ed. of Anwari's Khilafat (A.H. 1297, A.D. 1880).\n2 K. reads \u0644\u06cc\u06a9\u0645; L. \u062f\u0631\u06cc\u06a9\u0645.\n3 K. adds \u0648.\n4 S. reads \u06cc\u0644 for \u06cc\u0644.\n5 For \u062f\u0631 O. has \u062f\u0631\u061b L. \u062f\u0631\u061b K. \u062f\u0631.\n6 For \u0634\u0631\u06cc\u0641 C.\u060c L.\u060c and K. read \u0635\u0631\u0641.\n7 C. \u062c\u062f\u06cc\u062f \u0627\u0632 \u062c\u062f\u06cc\u062f\u061b K. \u062c\u062f\u06cc\u062f \u0627\u0632 \u062c\u062f\u06cc\u062f.\n8 C. omits these two hemistichs.\nOf Logic, Music, and Astronomy I know something; to speak truly I have a goodly portion.\nIn Metaphysics, if thou wilt believe it, I can skilfully explain and develop that which noble Reason affirms.\nOf Natural Science, also, I can reveal sundry enigmas (though it be not without diffidence), though the envious man regard me not.\nNeither am I a stranger to the effects and influences of the stars. If thou dost not believe me, take the trouble [to come and prove me]: I am ready.\"\n\nIn later life he repented, and ceased to frequent the Royal Court; and when the King sent for him, he wrote this fragment in reply:\n\n\u0643\u0644\u0645\u0647 \u0643\u0646\u062f\u0631\u0648 \u0628\u0631\u0648\u0632 \u0648 \u0628\u0634\u0628 \u062c\u0627\u06cc \u0622\u0631\u0627\u0645 \u0648 \u062e\u0648\u0631\u062f \u0648 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0628 \u0645\u0646\u0633\u062a\n\u062d\u0627\u0644\u06cc \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0645 \u0627\u0646\u062f\u0631\u0648 \u06a9\u0647 \u0627\u0632 \u0622\u0646 \u0686\u0631\u062e \u062f\u0631\u0645\u06cc \u0631\u0634\u062f \u0648 \u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0645\u0646\u0633\u062a\n\u0622\u0646 \u0628\u0647\u0645 \u062f\u0631 \u06a9\u0647 \u06af\u0648\u06cc \u0633\u0647\u0631 \u0630\u0631\u0647 \u0646\u0648\u0631 \u0622\u0641\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0646\u0633\u062a\n\u0648\u0622\u0646 \u062c\u0647\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u0631 \u06a9\u0647 \u062d\u0633\u0631\u062a \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u067e\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0632\u062f\u060c \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0644 \u0644\u0645\u0639\u0647 \u0634\u0631\u0627\u0628 \u0645\u0646\u0633\u062a\n\u0647\u0631\u0686\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u0645\u062c\u0644\u0633 \u0645\u0644\u06a9 \u0628\u0648\u062f \u0647\u0645\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u06a9\u0644\u0645\u0647 \u062e\u0631\u0627\u0628 \u0645\u0646\u0633\u062a\n\u0631\u062c\u0644 \u062c\u0631\u0627\u062f \u0648\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u062e\u0634\u06a9 \u0628\u0631\u0648 \u06af\u0631\u062f \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u0648 \u06a9\u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0645\u0646\u0633\u062a\n\u0634\u06cc\u0634\u0647 \u062d\u0633\u0631\u062a \u0645\u0646 \u06a9\u0647 \u067e\u0627\u062f\u0627 \u067e\u0631 \u067e\u06cc\u0634 \u0645\u0646 \u0634\u06cc\u0634\u0647 \u0634\u0631\u0627\u0628 \u0645\u0646\u0633\u062a\n\u0642\u0644\u0645 \u06a9\u0648\u062a\u0627\u0647 \u0648 \u0645\u0631\u06cc\u0632 \u062e\u0648\u0634\u0634 \u0632\u062e\u0645 \u0648 \u0646\u06af\u0645\u0647 \u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0628 \u0645\u0646\u0633\u062a\n\n1 This poem occurs on pp. 593-4 of the Lakhnaw ed. of Anwari's Kulliyat (A.H. 1297, A.D. 1880).\n2 K. om.

He has produced some incomparable verses, amongst them the following:\n\n---\n\n1 The circumstances of this murder are detailed by Dawlatsh\u00e1h (p. 93).\n2 C. i., C. ii. have to for \u0644\u064e\u0648\u0652.\n3 L. i. \u0643\u064e\u0645\u0652\u062a\u064e \u0627\u064e\u0648\u0652.\nO pale-faced candle, with tear-filled eyes, thou art the chief of calamity-stricken lovers!\nThou art the Farhad of thy time: then burn and melt, for why hast thou severed thyself from the company of Shirin?\nThou hast lost a sweetheart, else wherefore, like me, art thou pallid in hue, tear-stained, feeble, and bent?\nIf thou art an object of love, why hast thou thy cheeks so pale? And if thou art a lover, why dost thou hold thyself so erect?\n\n1 L.1\n2 L.1\n3 These three couplets occur in S. only.\n4 L.1\n5 C.1; C.2\n6 K.; C.1, C.2\nAs for that which thou deemest the Light of thine eyes, by reason of that Light of thine eyes thou art indeed ever dissolved in tears.\n\nWhat, then, is that sign creeping down the arm if thou hast not bitten the hand by reason of this disappointment?\u00b9\n\nI adjure thee by God [to tell me] whether, since thou hast kept company with the candle, thou hast heard thy description from anyone as thou hast from Athir!\u00b2\n\n6. Im\u00e1mi of Her\u00e1t.\n\nHis name was Ab\u00fa \u2018Abdil\u2019l\u00e4h Mu\u1e25ammad b. Ab\u00fa Bakr b. \u2018Uthm\u00e1n. He was the panegyrist of the Kings and ministers of Kirm\u00e1n, and died in the time of Ab\u00e1q\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n [A.H. 663\u2013680, A.D. 1265\u20131281]. He has some fine verses. Here is an acrostic on his own name, which he addressed, as a test [of their skill], to the accountants:\n\n\u00b9 The allusion is to the Egyptian women, to each of whom Zulaykh\u00e1 gave a knife and an orange just as Joseph was about to enter the room, and who, confounded by his beauty, inadvertently cut their hands instead of the fruit. The wax guttering down the candle is here compared to the blood gushing down their arms. Biting the hand indicates remorse; biting the finger, amusement.\n\n\u00b2 The curious idiom in this line (\u0644\u0627 \u0647\u0645\u064e\u0651\u0627\u0646\u064e\u0629\u064c) appears to be copied from the Arabic.\n\n\u00b3 L.\u00b9, K.: \u062a\u0635\u0641\u064a\u0641. S.: \u062a\u0639\u0635\u0641\u064a\u0641. The full explanation of these difficult verses given below has enabled me to reconstruct the text with considerable certainty, so that I have not thought it necessary to note more than the principal variants.\n\n\u2074 K.: \u062a\u0635\u0641\u064a\u0641.\n\n\u2075 S. has \u0627\u0645\u0631\u0623\u0629 for \u0644\u0622\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0621 \u0648\u062a\u0639\u0635\u0641\u064a\u0641 for \u062a\u0639\u0635\u0641\u064a\u0641.\n\"Half the third of the fifth of that odd pair whereof the fifth of the sixth is, beyond doubt, outside the pale of numbers.\n\nOnce again multiply it as it stands by the third of the capital, and when thou hast multiplied it, double it.\n\nAgain add the sixth and the tenth of the third of it to these two [previous results]: nay, nay, [first] take from it the half and the third.\n\nIf now thou wilt extract the cube root of Ghayn \\[x = 1000\\] and the square root of Dh\u00e1 \\[x = 900\\], add this to it [the previous result], and reduce to writing four and five.\n\nI have communicated to the accountant a name by an acrostic in his own science: Bid him acknowledge Im\u00e1mi's skill in his own science!\"\n\nThe term \"odd pair\" (\u0632\u0648\u062c \u0641\u0631) is applied to a number whereof, when it is halved, the two factors are equal and uneven. That which is \"outside the pale of numbers\" is one, for one results only from the subdivision of real numbers. Now when one is taken as the fifth of the sixth of an amount, that amount must be thirty, and a third of the fifth of thirty is two, which, when you halve it, gives one: that is alif (\u0627).\n\nWhen you multiply this third of the fifth, which is two, by the third of the \"capital\" (\u0645\u0627\u0644), that is the third of thirty, which is ten, it gives twenty, and this, when you double it, gives forty; that is mim (\u0645).\n\nThe sixth of that thirty is five, and the tenth of the\n\n\\[1 \\text{ L}, 1 \\text{ K}, \\text{ \u0645\u06cc}.\\\\\n2 \\text{ L}, 1 \\text{ \u0637\u0627\u0631\u0627}.\\\\\n3 \\text{ In the text of S, \u0645\u06cc}.\\\\]\nthird of it one. The two together are six. When you cast out five-sixths of this [i.e. \\( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{5}{6} \\)], one remains: that is alif (\u0627).\n\nWhen any number is multiplied by a number like itself, they call the first the \"square root\" (\u062c\u0630\u0631), and the result of the multiplication \"the square\" (\u0645\u0631\u0628\u0639). When the square is again multiplied by the square root, that which was before called the square root is called the \"cube root\" (\u0643\u0639\u0643\u0629). Now since the number equivalent to [the letter] ghayn (\u063a) is 1000, the cube root of it must be 10; that is to say \\( 10 \\times 10 = 100 \\) and \\( 100 \\times 10 = 1000 \\). And since the number equivalent to dh\u00e1 (\u062f) is 900, the square root of it is 30; that is to say, \\( 30 \\times 30 = 900 \\). So 10, which is the cube root of ghayn (\u063a), and 30, which is the square root of dh\u00e1 (\u062f), come to 40: that is mim (\u0645).\n\nThe cypher of four [i.e. the letter which has four as its numerical value] is d\u00e1l (\u062f) and the cypher of five is h\u00e1 (\u0647), and d\u00e1l and h\u00e1 in the form of writing are dah, ten (\u062f); and in the abjad computation 10 is equivalent to the letter y\u00e1 (\u064a). In this way the name Im\u00e1mi [1 + 40 + 1 + 40 + 10 = alif, mim, alif, mim, y\u00e1 = \u0627\u0633\u0645\u064a] results.\n\n7. Abu'l-Faraj of R\u00fana.\n\nR\u00fana is a village in the district of Kh\u00e1war\u00e1n in Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n. He [Abu'l-Faraj] has some good verses, and was the contemporary of Sult\u00e1n Maliksh\u00e1h the Salj\u00faq [A.H. 465\u2013485, A.D. 1072\u20131092] and his sons. It is said that Anw\u00e1ri was at first his pupil, though finally far surpassing him in the poetic art.\n\n8. Ibn Kha\u1e6d\u00edb of Ganja.\n\nHis name is T\u00e1ju'd-D\u00edn Al\u1e25mad. He was the contemporary of Sult\u00e1n Mahm\u00fad of Ghazna [A.H. 388\u2013421, A.D. 998\u20131030], and has some fine verses; his poetical contests with his\nmistress Mahsati are especially piquant. It is said that before his marriage Ibn Khatib of Ganja invited Mahsati to a love-tryst, but she refused, and wrote in answer:\n\n\"O idol mine, I will not suffer abasement at thy hands, nor even at the hands of one who is superior to thee.\n\nI will not precipitately entangle my tresses in the noose:\nI will lie at ease on the water and yet not get wet!\"  \n\nIbn Khatib of Ganja beguiled her, and got possession of her under another name; and, after he had had his desire of her, said to her:\n\n9. Awhadi.\n\nHe has some fine verses, amongst them these:\n\n1 So pointed in S. \"Mah-sati\" (\u0645\u062d\u0645\u0648\u062f). A similar pronunciation is indicated in the Biographies of Celebrated Women entitled Khayrat al-Husaini, lithographed at Tiflis in A.H. 1307 (vol. iii, pp. 103-104), where the etymology of the name is given as M\u0101h \"great,\" and S\u0101t\u012b \"lady,\" though other derivations (Mah-asti, Mith-asti) are also discussed.\n\n2 K. \u064a\u06a9 \u062a\u0627\u0631, which seems a better reading, though not so strongly supported by manuscript authority.\n\n3 This is equivalent to saying \"I will play with fire and not get burned.\"\n\n4 L. \u062c\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064f \u0627\u0650\u0646\u0652\u0647\u0650\u0645\u0652.\n\n5 C.1, C.2.\n\n6 C.2 has \u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0634 \u0647\u0627\u06a9.\n\"My beloved hath imprinted figures of musk on the moon; hath cast a consuming fire into the hearts of men.

Asadi.\n\nHe has produced some fine verses. The book entitled Karshap-n\u00e1ma is one of his compositions.\n\n11.

Malik Iftikh\u00e1r\u00fa'd-D\u00edn of Qazw\u00edn was constructing a lofty building. Abu'l-M\u00e1jid came to see it.

This poet is the subject of the next notice (No. 17), and a transposition of these two articles in some MSS. of the G\u00e1sida (e.g. L.\u2074 and L.\u2075) would lead anyone using them to arrive at the same conclusion as Dowlatabad.\n\n17.

XXVII.\u2014Notes on Malayalam Literature. By T. K. Krishna Menon, B.A., M.R.A.S.\n\nMalayalam is the language of the south-west of the Madras Presidency. It is the third most important language of the Presidency, the first and the second being Tamil and Telugu respectively. It is spoken in Malabar, Cochin, and Travancore. Out of a total of 5,932,207 inhabitants of these parts, 5,409,350 persons are those who speak Malayalam. These countries, taken as a whole, are bounded on the north by South Canara, on the east by the far-famed Malaya range of mountains, on the south by the Indian Ocean, and on the west by the Arabian Sea.\n\nThe earliest Malayalam writing of which we have any knowledge was in Vattezuthu characters. This was subsequently modified into K\u00f6leluthu. The present script is called Malayalam Grantha.\n\nNo sketch of Malayalam literature can be complete which does not make mention of the Malayalees who have won renown by their works in Sanskrit.\n\nKerala claims among her sons Vararuci, the great progenitor of astronomical science in Malabar, and Bhartruhari, the renowned author of the three \u015aatakams. The early literary history of the Malayalam language contains so many stories about them that it would be impossible for anyone to believe that they were not Malayalees. They may be placed in the seventh century. The great theologian and philosopher, Sankar\u0101c\u0101rya, was born in the eighth century, at Kalati, on the banks of the \u0100lwaye river, in Travancore territory. Yudhishthira Vijaya, a K\u0101rya of a peculiar structure, is the work of V\u0101su Bhattathiri. He was, like Sankar\u0101c\u0101rya, a Namburi, which means a Malayalee Vedic Brahman. The K\u0101ryam\u0101l\u0101 Editors have done an injustice to Malabar.\nby ascribing the authorship of this poem to a native of Kashmir. Karingampilli Namburi, the author of *Suka Sandesam*, lived about A.D. 1480. He gives us vivid sketches of many parts of Malabar which are dear to every Malayalee. *Vilvamangalath Swamiar* has written a *Kavyam* of singular interest. It is in Prakrit, and every verse serves as an example of a separate rule on grammar. Kakkassiri Bhattathiri, Manavikrama the Strong, and Elaya Raja 'the learned' of Kodungallore, were also natives of Malayalam. *Mepputhur Narayana Bhattathiri*, a poet, grammarian and scholar of unquestioned ability, wrote, in 1587, *Narayaniyam*, which treats of the life and teachings of Sri Krishna, and is, more or less, an abridgement of the Bhagavata Purana. His grammatical work *Prakriya Sareusa* is much more lucid than Bhattoji Dikshita's *Sidhanta Kaumudi*.\n\n*Manavedan Raja* composed the *Manaveda Campu*, which treats of Mah\u0101-Bh\u0101rata legends not treated of in the *Bh\u0101rata Campu* by \u0100nantakavi. *Malamangaliam Namb\u016bri* was the author of the famous *Bh\u0101nam* called after his name.\n\n*Ar\u016br Bhattathiri* produced *Uttaramaishadham*, a complement to the work of Sri Harsha. K. R\u0101ma Warrier, who may be appropriately styled the Mallin\u0101tha of modern times, has written various commentaries. The *Vi\u015b\u0101kha Vijayam* and *Thulabh\u0101ra Satakam* of H.H. Kerala Varma, Valia Koil Tampuran of Travancore, are interesting examples of Sanskrit as it is now written in the Malayalam country, and his nephew and pupil Mr. A. R. Rajaraja Varma, M.A., bids fair to become a good second to his uncle. Mr. Kochunni Tampuran of Kodungallor's *Vipra Sandesam* and *Bh\u0101nam* should be mentioned in this connection. Mr. Manavikraman \u0112tan Raja, of Calicut, is a good scholar and poet. Mr. Punnasseri Neelakandha Sarma edits a Sanskrit journal which reflects great credit on his Sanskrit scholarship and philanthropy. The Sanskrit College and the Text-book Committee of Travancore show the profound interest which the Sovereigns of the Model State take in the cause of Sanskrit and Malayalam.\nIt is a matter for congratulation to the Malayalees that we see the beginnings of Malayalam prose literature as early as A.D. 200. Deeds then granted to the Jews and Syrian Christians by contemporary kings are written in prose, and there are court chronicles which claim to go back to those days. Many songs, too, are supposed to have been composed at this period for the people to sing when they worship, when they plant, and when they reap. Some of them, and also certain early ballads, are very popular even in these days. Of these the most popular are those that sing of the deeds of Thatch\u014d\u1e37i Kunhi Oth\u0113nan. Kunhi Oth\u0113nan was a N\u0101yar, which is the common appellation of the ordinary middle-class Hindu of Malabar. N\u0101yars, it may be said parenthetically, form the major portion of the population of Keralam. Oth\u0113nan, according to the ballad, was a man of fine physique and skilled in the use of arms. He went about redressing wrongs and helping fallen humanity, and is said to have met with his death by a treacherous shot.\n\nThe history of the Malayalam language really commences, however, with Ramacaritam, the oldest Malayalam poem still in existence. This is the work of a Mah\u0101 R\u0101ja of Travancore, who lived in the thirteenth century. Another work of possibly the same period is Kannassa Paniker's R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47am. And we hear of many Namb\u016bries who then wrote works on astrology, architecture, ethics, grammar, and other subjects. But little is known of them now save their names and the names of their works.\n\nThe Namb\u016bries, at that time, certainly held a practical monopoly over learning, and created all sorts of obstacles in the way of the education of the commonalty.\n\nCheruss\u0113ri Namb\u016bri, the morning-star of Malayalam song, wrote his Krishna G\u0101\u1e6dha in the fifteenth century. This work, like almost all the poetical pieces of Malayalam, is written in what is called Mani-prav\u0101lam, which means a string of gems. It receives its name from being composed in a mixture of Malayalam and Sanskrit. The addition, here and there, of common Sanskrit words only gives grace and majesty to Malayalam, which otherwise would be bald.\nThe metres of Malayalam *slokas* are the same as those of Sanskrit ones; and those that are peculiar to the language, as in the case of the famous works of Thujuan and Kottaraka, are determined by the number of *matras*.\n\n*Kathakali*, or the Malayalam play, is one of the most intensely national departments of our literature. These plays are written in mixed verse and prose, and are founded upon episodes of the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a and Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. The verses simply connect the incidents of the story, while the prose portions represent the words of the characters of the drama. The actors, representing the several personages, generally have all sorts of paints on their faces and are garbed in costumes. By means of certain signs made by their hands and by the expressions on their face, they convey to the audience the meaning of the prose portions when they are sung to the accompaniment of drums and other instruments.\n\nThe poet who invented this sort of dramatic composition is one R\u0101ja of the Kottarakara family in Travancore. The subjects of his dramas are episodes of the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a. There is a tradition connected with the origin of *Kathakali*. It is said that Zamorin of Calicut, for one reason or another, refused to send his troupe of artistes to the southern parts to perform *Krishnattam*. The inventor of Kathakali produced his work to make light of the decision of his northern comrade.\n\nThe most famous writer of Malayalam is perhaps Thiruvalluvar. Jathu Ram\u0101nujan Eluthachian, a man of the Nair caste, who opposed himself openly to the prejudices and intolerance of the Brahmins. He is said to have declared it his intention to raise Malayalam to an equality with the sacred language of the priests. In the prosecution of this purpose, he made, in the native tongue, adaptations of the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47am, the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\u1e41, and the Bhagavatam. These are called the *Kilippattus* (parrot-songs) of Eluthachian, who was the first to introduce this sort of composition into the Malayalam language. They receive this name, perhaps, from the introductory invocation, which is to the bird or goddess of learning.\nHe wrote many other works besides those already referred to. He had several disciples, too, who carried on his work. In this connection, reference must be made to the name of Eluvathu N\u0101nukutti Menon of Chittur, who, by his translation of Ekadana, has shown how much he has caught of the literary spirit and religious fervour of his great forerunner, Eluthachan.\n\nKerala Varma R\u0101ja, of North Kottayam, is the author of a R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a and of a Vair\u0101gya Candrodaya. The brother of this R\u0101ja was also a gifted man, and wrote four Malayalam dramas, called Kuthakal\u012b, some poems, and a grammar.\n\nThe name of Malamangalam Namh\u016bri was previously mentioned in connection with his Sanskrit work. He deserves this second reference for his great work in Malayalam called Bh\u0101sh\u0101n\u0101ishadha Campu. In the world of literature he is a great man indeed. His description of the wailings and wanderings of Damayanti after she was deserted by Na\u1e37a is much admired. But he is very monotonous in his verse and prose, and is not free from the prevailing defect of many Malayalee poets of using an unnecessarily large number of Sanskrit words in their Malayalam works.\n\nThullals (literally dances) are sung to the accompaniment of music, pantomime, and dancing. There are three classes of Thullals: \u014cattam, Sithankan, and Parayan; but, as the poems of the first class predominate, poems of the other classes are also termed \u014cattams. They are based on the episodes of Bh\u0101ratam and R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47am mostly. \u014cattam Thullal, as the name indicates (\u014cattam = 'running'), consists of a variety of rapid metres well suited for amusing narratives. \u014cattams are vigorous, Sithankans narrative, and Parayans pathetic in style. Na\u1e37acarita and Kor\u0101tha are instances of the first class, Kaly\u0101\u1e47asauvandhika is an example of the second set, while Gujendran\u0101saka and Sah\u0101prorisa form instances of the third sort of Thullals. All these Thullals referred to are the works of Kalakkath K\u016b\u1e6djan Namby\u0101r, who invented this sort of composition. Besides fifty or sixty Thullals, he\nhas composed nine Malayalam dramas, a Po\u00f1\u00f1u\u015b\u0101sana, a Srikrish\u1e47acarita, and parrot-songs and poems in different kinds of metres.\n\nKunjan Namby\u0101r is, by the unanimous verdict of his countrymen, second only to Thunjath Eluthachan. Patrons and plebeians united in honouring him. He was under the special patronage of the Mah\u0101 R\u0101ja, who began to reign in Travancore in the year A.D. 1758, and who, besides being a man of letters himself, encouraged literary men in all parts of Malabar.\n\nAnother writer of the same period is Unn\u0101yi W\u0101lappa, who wrote the Na\u1e6dacarita Kathaku\u1e6di.\nArt. XXVIII.\u2014Addenda to the Series of Path\u00e1n Coins.\n\nII. By H. NELSON WRIGHT, I.C.S.\n\n(Continued from page 499.)\n\nSince writing my last paper on the coins of the Path\u00e1n Sult\u00e1ns of Delhi I have had the opportunity of examining with some minuteness the rich collections of the British Museum and Dr. L. White King, C.S.I. In the former are to be found the choicest specimens of General Cunningham's Muhammadan coins, of which many have already been brought to notice by Mr. Gibbs and Mr. C. J. Rodgers, but others are now, through the courtesy of the Museum authorities, described for the first time.\n\nOf the forty-one coins now published, fourteen come from the British Museum, ten from the collection of Dr. White King, and three from the Bodleian Museum, Oxford, while one belongs to Major Vost, and thirteen are from my own cabinet. The majority are coins of the Suri Sult\u00e1ns, a period which, apart from the important change in the character of the currency on Sher Shah's accession, and the beauty and variety of the coins themselves, is of peculiar interest to the numismatist by reason of the expansion of the mint system, through which the collector is enabled both to direct the interest of the antiquary towards deserted and forgotten cities of erstwhile importance, and also to help the historian in fixing the limits and extent of these sovereigns' dominions by confirming and supplementing the scanty materials on which he has to rely. The account of the coins of the Suri period given by Mr. Thomas in the \"Chronicles\" has perhaps left more to be added to it than any other part of that work, and though a considerable quantity of fresh information has been published by Mr. Rodgers and Dr. Hoernle, I hope to\nhave shown by these two papers that there is still much to be done in bringing to light the mint towns used by Shah and his son and in identifying their locality.\n\nI wish here to gratefully acknowledge the constant help given to me by Mr. E. J. Rapson and the other members of the British Museum Numismatic staff during the preparation of these papers.\n\nNote.\u2014L. W. K. = Cabinet of Dr. L.

White King, C.S.I. They were struck after the death but in the name of Muizz-ud-din Muhammad bin Sam. No. 2 is similar in character to the coin figured in the \"Chronicles,\" Pl. I (3); its peculiarity is its weight. T\u00e1j-ud-din's connection with India was intermittent. From the Minhaj-us-siraj we learn that Yalduz, who had been governor of Karm\u00e1n, on his sovereign's death disputed with Kutbuddin Aibek the possession of Lahore. In a battle, however, which ensued, victory remained with the latter, and Yalduz fled to Ghazni. After Kutbuddin's death in 607 A.H. Lahore was again a bone of contention, and was held sometimes by Yalduz, sometimes by Nasiruddin Kubacha, and sometimes by Shamsuddin Altamsh. Till A.H. 612 Yalduz was supreme in Ghazni. In that year he was driven out by Alaouddin Khwarizm and went to Lahore, but not satisfied with the extent of his possession, he picked a quarrel with Shamshuddin Altamsh, only, however, to be defeated and end his life as a prisoner.\n\n3.

Gold. Weight 169-2 grs. B.M. Pl. I, 7.\nDate 727. Mint: The Town of Daulatabad.\n\nLegends similar to those on No. 7, but mint name more legible.\n\nThese coins, as struck in the name of Ghiyas-ud-din Tughlak and bearing in the reverse area what is not unlike the date 721, have always been classified as coins of that Sult\u00e1n. They were, however, undoubtedly struck after his death. In the J.A.S.B. 1886, Mr. C. J. Rodgers published a coin of this type bearing a marginal date of 726, and he consequently interpreted the characters immediately following the date in the reverse area, which in the \"Chronicles\" (p. 190) are read as 721, to be 726. On coin No. 8 above, however, the same characters appear in conjunction with a clear marginal date of 727, and Dr. White King's coin finally settles the point by leaving no doubt that the characters are not figures, but a badly formed \u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646. The crudeness of these Daulatabad coins is also shown by the omission, in all the coins of the type which I have seen, of the initial of the mint name.\n\nIn his second Supplement to the \"Chronicles\" Mr. C. J. Rodgers edited a coin of this type (No. 8) on which he read \"Mulk-i-talang\" as the mint place. I have seen no other coin of this type struck at Telengana, and, judging merely from Mr. Rodgers's drawing of the coin, I am inclined to think that the word which he read as \u0645\u0644\u0643 was really the first part of \u0628\u0644\u0627\u062f, the rest of the mint name being too indistinct to be legible.\n\nThe small silver or billon posthumous pieces noticed by Mr. Thomas, pp. 212 and 213 (notes), and also by Mr. Rodgers in his Supplements, were also probably struck in the Deccan.\nADDENDA TO THE SERIES OF PATH\u00c1N COINS.\n\n9.

The first three letters of the mint name on the Bodleian\ncoin are, in my opinion, unmistakeably \u0643\u0644\u0627\u0644, and this conclusion is strengthened by the mint-mark on the reverse\u2014a six-rayed star\u2014a mark which is borne on all the silver coins of Kalpi struck by Sher Shah, and which is very prominent on a copper coin of that mint figured by me in the July number of this Journal.\n\n30.

Mr. Lane-Poole thought the mint might be Gwalior. I do not think this is possible, judging from the formation of the letters and the fact that the coins of Gwalior mint are of quite a different type, but my own reading is also tentative. The coin is, I believe, unique, and I feel justified in drawing special attention to it by reason of the interest which accrues to a new mint town. Raisin is in the Native State of Bhopal, 10 miles from the Sanchi tope on the road from Hoshangabad to Sagor. As a fort it played a fairly conspicuous part in the attempt of the Hindu chiefs to escape from subjection to Sher Shah and his Afghans. In 950 A.H. Sher Shah, hearing that Puran Mal, who was acting as deputy to the minor raja of that district, had insulted the Mahommedan\nfamilies in Chanderi, spent six months in the siege of Raisin, and after enticing Puran Mal and his followers out with promises of safety, perfidiously had them massacred on a pretence of obeying a decision of his 'ulama.\n\nThere is also a Ras\u0101n in Tahsil Badausa, Banda District, Bundelkhand, which was the headquarters of a pargana in the reign of Akbar.\n\n31.

The legends also differ from those usually found on the smaller copper pieces. What its denomination may have been I am not prepared to say. To call it a twelfth of a d\u00e1m would make the d\u00e1m 340 grs. The coin is scarcely heavy enough to be a tenth of a d\u00e1m, and it does not appear to have lost weight to any appreciable extent by wear and tear. In my last paper I endeavoured to show, on the evidence of certain coins, that Sher Shah coined decimal fractions of the d\u00e1m. It is possible, therefore, that Islam Shah continued the practice, and that the present coin must be taken as a short-weight tenth of a d\u00e1m.\n\n40. Muhammad Adil Shah.\n\nSilver. Weight?

It is figured as No. 727 in Marsden's Numismata Orientalia, but is there assigned to the Muhammad Shah (son of Farid Shah) who reigned in 837. The mint, too, was not read. The coin has not been described by Thomas, and I have never seen any correction of Marsden's mistake elsewhere. The type of the coin shows that it was struck by Muhammad Adil. It is, I believe, unique. All rupees of this Sultan are rare, particularly those giving the name of their mint town.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n\nI. THE ASOKASTAMI FESTIVAL.\n\nSir,\u2014Captain Gurdon, in his interesting account of the Aswakranta shrine near Gauhati (not Ganhati, as printed), writes of the Asokastami festival as if it were peculiar to that shrine, and indeed attributes the origin of the festival to the legend that it was there that Rukmini bathed. But on the Asokastami day (the day before the Ramnavami) people bathe in the Brahmaputra all along the north bank. The correct procedure is to stand up to your waist in the water, holding in your hand eight buds (why eight, I know not) of the Asoka. You recite the following mantra:\n\n\"Yam a\u1e63okam harabhis\u1e6dtam madhu m\u0101\u1e41s\u0101m samudbhavet\nPib\u0101mi \u1e63okasant\u0101ptam m\u0101\u1e41 a\u1e63okam sad\u0101 kurn.\"\n\nYou then swallow the buds, and obtain all the benefits you might have got by bathing in the sacred Ganges itself.\n\nThe legend of the festival's origin told me differs from Captain Gurdon's version, and is interesting as an instance of a Hindu story growing out of a pre-Hindu belief. The name Brahmaputra is no doubt a translation of the primitive Assamese name of the river, just as the Khyendwin in Burma is said to mean \"Son of God.\" Given the name Brahmaputra, required to find an etymological explanation. The explanation is found in a local variant of the Parasuraman mythus. The sons of Brahm\u0101 figure largely in Assamese mythology. The fire sacrifice of Daksha, for instance, is thought to be reproduced every year in the cressets of jungle fire which create pillars of smoke and of fire.\nby night along the summits of the northern hills. I do not remember who it was that bore Brahmaputra to Brahm\u0101, but\n\n\"His daughter she: in Saturn's reign\nSuch mixture was not held a stain.\"\n\nFor long years she bore her son in her womb, and only obtained delivery by visiting the sacred spring of Brahma Kunda far in the Mishmi hills. But Brahmaputra was still only a pool, and not yet one of the mightiest of Indian rivers. Here comes in the Parasur\u0101m legend. The Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata tells how Parasur\u0101m alone of his brothers obeyed the command of his father and cut off the head of his mother Renuk\u0101. The epic says that his obedience so pleased his father that he was told to ask a boon. He begged that his mother might be restored pure to life, and that he himself might be invincible in single combat and enjoy length of days. The Assamese version is that he received the curse that his great axe should cleave to his hand till he should set free the son of Brahm\u0101 by cleaving the Brahma Kunda gorge. This reminds one (as Assamese versions of Hindu stories frequently do) of the Madras story, that Parasur\u0101m \"drove back the ocean, and cut fissures in the Gh\u0101\u1e6da with blows of his axe.\" Doubtless the A\u015bok\u0101stami is the survival of some primitive prehistoric bathing festival, adopted in the usual catholic fashion of Hinduism, and explained at Gauhati, as Captain Gurdon suggests, by the legend of the fair Rukmini's bathing. It is sad to think that we shall never know the real, the primeval reason why the bathing is confined to the north bank.\n\nEven more interesting than the A\u015bwakr\u0101nta shrine are the wonderful ruins at Singri parvat and at Tezpur in the Darrang district, to which I hope the Assam Director of Ethnography may be able to turn his attention. At both these places are heaped vast blocks of carved granite, volutes, pilasters, and images, some of the blocks covered with a curious conventional ornament which the modern Assamese calls \"Daffla writing.\" The Singri ruins are visited in the cold weather by pilgrims from the Daffla\nhills, who maintain that they are relics of the Daffla rule in the plains in bygone days. They have doubtless been wrecked by some tremendous earthquake, though there is a story that they were blown up with gunpowder by \"K\u0101l\u0101 pah\u0101r,\" the Mahomedan general. But assuredly no Mahomedan gunpowder could work such havoc in buildings constructed solely of huge square blocks of granite such as modern engineers would find it hard to move with all their appliances. I know of no Hindu legend which has attached itself to the Singri ruins, which lie in dense forests and far from human habitation. The Tezpur ruins, however, are in the heart of the modern civil station, and (I shudder to tell it) the plinth of the Deputy Commissioner's cutcherry is largely composed of carved granite blocks. About these ruins has grown the pretty story of the princess U\u015bh\u0101 and her handmaiden Chitralakh\u016b, and the Assamese believe that Tezpur was once Mah\u0101balipura, the capital of her grandfather. This is another instance of a legend borrowed from Southern India, as are many of those connected with the great Tantric shrine of K\u0101n\u0101khshy\u0101 at Gauhati, of which Captain Gurdon has probably much that is interesting to tell.\n\nThe chief interest of these borrowed legends lies in their adaptation to local conditions, and especially to the primitive local beliefs. We shall soon have from the pen of Mr. E. A. Gait a History of Hindu Assam, and, as far as can be gathered from scanty records, of the Assam of pre-Hindu days. It is a pity that so much of ancient belief and history has been obliterated by Hindu legend, so that, for instance, it is only due to the comparatively recent conversion of Manipur to Hinduism that we happen to know by how quaint a fiction the Manipuris, the N\u0101ga folk of Imphal, became \"sons of Arjun.\" The local legends of Assam, as containing traces of prehistoric belief, are well worth studying, and we must hope that Captain Gurdon's paper in the Journal is a foretaste of further investigations into shrines even more interesting.\u2014Yours faithfully,\n\nJ. D. Anderson.\nP.S.\u2014Professor Barnett has been so good as to write the following note on the \u0101loka quoted above:\u2014\u201cThis mantra apparently to be spoken in drinking the sacred waters. The text may be rendered: \u2018May that which (men call) A\u1e63oka, sweetmeat, agreeable to Hara (Civa), grow in me. I drink. Make thou me, who am oppressed with grief, to be ever griefless.\u2019 The difficulty is in the first half of the stanza. There is a play on the word a\u1e63oka, which signifies both \u2018sorrowless\u2019 and the tree *Jonesia A\u1e63oka*, branches of the latter being used in this ceremony; and, further, m\u0101\u1e43sa may also mean this tree, though usually signifying nectar or liquid (butter, honey, etc.), or simply \u2018sweet.\u2019 Thus, one might take madhu m\u0101\u1e43sam as a compound adjective qualifying a\u1e63okam, and meaning \u2018sweet of flesh,\u2019 or as a compound noun \u2018butter and meat.\u2019 In any case, the prayer means that it is to rise to the worshippers, as the A\u1e63oka grows, in a causal connection with the latter. I strongly suspect that the masculine yam should be altered to the neuter yad. In that case it would be best to take a\u1e63okam as adjective rendering \u2018I drink that which (I pray) may rise as sorrow food (or the like),\u2019 etc. Water is the source of vegetation and other life.\u201d\n\nJuly 14, 1900.\n\n2. End of the World.\n\n24, Buckingham Gate, S.W.\n\nAug. 4th, 1900.\n\nDear Professor Rhys Davids,\u2014A very widely spread belief that the end of the world would take place on the night of the 13th November prevailed last year in Egypt. This was no doubt connected with the shower of Lechwe which was expected by the European papers to be especially brilliant about then, and the native newspapers started reports which were the cause of the idea referred to.\n\nI have heard that in some of the balads of Gizeh the inhabitants camped out in the desert, I suppose with a view\nidea of escaping, leaving their balads deserted and giving thieves an opportunity that they did not lose.\n\nPerhaps this and similar stories of people eating up their stores and beasts, thinking it useless to keep them, are exaggerated, but I can vouch for the belief having been held to a considerable extent in the provinces of Girgeh and Assyut, where I happened to be at the time.

A Nitima\u00f1jar\u012b Quotation Identified.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014While looking over the MSS. of the Hultzsch Collection, now in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, I came across what is probably the original of a quotation made by Dy\u0101 Dviveda in his Nitima\u00f1jar\u012b. No. 247 of the Hultzsch Collection (see ZDMG., xl, 19), whose shelf-mark in the Bodleian is d. 165, contains a Ved\u0101nta work, the Saptas\u016btra. In the colophon on f. 126 it is attributed to \u015a\u0101mkara: \u015br\u012bnac-chamkara\u015b\u0101ryaviracitam Saptas\u016btram sam\u0101ptam. It is apparently a somewhat rare work, as Aufrecht in his Catalogus Catalogorum, p. 696a, only cites besides this MS. three others, one in Oudh and two in Benares. What claim it has to be \u015a\u0101mkara's I do not know. Its style seems too simple, though its philosophy is pure Ved\u0101ntism, and as Aufrecht says (op. cit., p. 626b), of the treatises attributed to\nhim hardly the third part is his own. If it be not his, its date is quite uncertain. The MS. is not dated, but is probably, to judge from the paper, writing, etc., fully 100 years old.\n\nThe pertinent quotation occurs on f. 1b at verse 4. It runs: an\u0101tmabh\u016bte deh\u0101d\u0101ve \u0101tmabuddhis tu dehin\u0101m, avidy\u0101 tatkrto bandhas tanny\u0101s\u0101 mok\u1e63a ucyate. With the first half of this stanza is identical the quotation in the nitima\u00f1jari cited in J.R.A.S., 1900, p. 135. There the work is called the Atmaeriti, a very curious title, not elsewhere known. It is most probably merely a careless mistake on Dy\u0101's part.\u2014Yours truly,\n\nA. B. Keith.\n\nP.S.\u2014Professor Macdonell has pointed out to me, on the authority of Colonel Jacob, that this verse also occurs in the last chapter of S\u0101rvadar\u015banasamgraha, p. 167 (ed. 1858), or p. 188 (ed. 1872), in this form:\n\ntad uktam; an\u0101tmani ca deh\u0101d\u0101ve \u0101tmabuddhis tu dehin\u0101m, avidy\u0101 tatkrto bandhas tann\u0101s\u0101 mok\u1e63a ucyate.\n\nThis is the reading not only of these two editions but also of an undated edition in my possession, and of the MS. in the Bodleian. But it is distinctly inferior to that of the Saptas\u016btra, so it still is most probable that the latter was Dy\u0101's source.\n\nI have just discovered that Professor Peterson gave up his view of Dy\u0101's date. In his Report for 1886\u201392, p. lx, he writes: \"The date assigned by me to Dy\u0101 Dvivedin is wrong. The commentary shows that the line, in which the date is given, is to be read\n\nbindusara\u015baraikena mite samvat\u012b durdabhe,\nvatsare m\u0101gha\u015bukl\u0101d\u0101v akarot Dy\u0101 tith\u0101v im\u0101m.\n\nDy\u0101 Dvivedin, therefore, wrote in samvat 1550, and Professor Kielhorn was right in pointing out that he often used S\u0101ya\u1e47a. See Ulwar Catal., No. 37.\"\nThe date thus given, corresponding to A.D. 1493, is in itself quite acceptable. But the Ulwar MS., to judge from the specimens in Peterson, contains quite a different recension of the text from that in the MSS. used by me, and gives Dy\u0101's ancestry differently, besides assigning to him \u0100nandapura (perhaps Vadanagar, in Upper Gujar\u0101t) as his place of abode. So I hesitate to put much confidence in this date, unless further confirmation is forthcoming.\n\nOxford, July, 1900.\n\n4. THE CUNEIFORM INSCRIPTIONS OF VAN:\nLEXICOGRAPHICAL NOTE.\n\nQueen's College, Oxford.\nAugust 27, 1900.\n\nSir,\u2014In my Memoir on the Cuneiform Inscriptions of Van, Pt. IV, lxxvii, 9 (J.R.A.S., January, 1893), I arrived at the conclusion that the word (gis) uldi signified \"a post.\" An inscription of Argistis II, recently discovered and published by Drs. Belck & Lehmann (Nos. 130 and 131 of their collection) makes it the equivalent of the ideographs GIS KARANU, and thus shows that it was a particular kind of post, a \"vine-stock\" namely. Indeed, as udulis was \"a vine,\" it is possible that it is sometimes used in the sense of \"vineyard\"; in this case we should have to translate xxiii (Menuaunei \u0161ilaye Taririai ini uldi Tariria-khi-ni-li ti-mi), \"In honour of Taririas, the mother of Menuas, this has been called the vineyard of Taririas.\"\n\nNow, the discovery of the exact meaning of uldis clears up that of another word, zaris, which I had supposed to mean \"door.\" Zaris, however, has nothing to do with zaises, \"a gate.\" In lxxvii, 9, 10, we read, (gis) ulde (gis) zare terubi zadubi arniisi-ni-li istini; in lxiv, 1, 2, ALU (GIS) uldi (GIS) zari [teruni u SE-KAL-]MES arniisi-ni-li is-[tini du-li?]; and in lxxix, 18\u201321, terubi ikuka-khi-ni kigu GIS-KARANU GIS-TIR-GAN u SE-KAL-[MES] arniisi-ni-li ist[i ni] duli inani. Here (gis) zari or zare is made the equivalent of the ideographs\nGIS-TIR-GAN, \"grove of the garden\" (kistu sa meristi), and zaris accordingly must mean \"a garden grove\" or \"plantation\" consisting of peaches and pomegranates and similar trees. In W.A.I., ii, 23, 57e, it is said that \u0161arme, or rather \u0161arce, signified \"a forest\" or \"grove\" (kistu) in the language of \u0160u (i.e. \u0160uri or Northern Mesopotamia), and by the language of \u0160u, as I first pointed out in the Academy (Jan., 1890, p. 64), the Assyrian scribes meant the language of Mitanni.\n\nA. H. SAYCE.\nNOTICES OF BOOKS.\n\nTHE EARLY ANNALS OF THE ENGLISH IN BENGAL.\nC. R. WILSON, M.A., Bengal Educational Series.\nVolume II, part I. (London: W. Thacker & Co.,\nCreed Lane, 1900.)\n\nThis is a continuation of the excellent work, the\nvolume of which has been already noticed on pp. 178\nof this Journal for January, 1897. The present instal-\nment covers the years 1711 to 1717. As in the former vol-\nume there is a very good introduction; it gives an accoun-\nt of Calcutta under the rule of Wellden, Russell, and Red-\nHedges. The Addenda include notes on the family his-\ntory of these governors and other subjects of interest.\nLetters and Diaries of the Surman Embassy to the Great\nMogul will, we understand, appear as Part 2 of the pre-\nsent issue. We have several entries in this volume relat-\ning to that mission, and incidentally, on p. 155, we have a gra-\ncious and hardly overcharged picture of the way audience\nwere accorded by the Delhi emperor in the days of his glory.\n\n\"Whoever the Great Mogul is pleased to Honour\nleave to appear in his presence will after he is disarm'd\nadmitted into a Court Yard where he must stand exp-\nosure to the weather, (whatever it happens to be) at the appro-\npriate distance which will be out of hearing a word the King\nwill speak, who looking out at a window a Story high in\nPallace every man in sight of him must stand with his A...\"\na little crossing on his Stomack and his Toes close together without presuming to look up, when the King goes from his Window a Curtain is let fall and every man in the Court Yard Shuffles away without observing any order this is a Short account of the reception the King will give, but his Ministers generally admit Foreigners to sett Cross Legged in their Presence and talk to them but scarcely of their business for that must be treated by means of their under officers.\"\n\nThere are a great number of strange words scattered up and down these old records; and, even after Mr. Wilson has worked hard at them, there are still many left without explanation. One or two instances may be given. The odd word Botard on p. 175, evidently the title of some Mogul official, is, we would suggest, meant for Buy\u016bd\u0101t, formed by a double plural from Ba\u00eft (Arabic), a house, Buy\u016bt, houses. The proper form for the holder of the office is Buy\u016bd\u0101t\u012b; but it is generally contracted into Buy\u016bd\u0101t, of which Botard is an easy corruption. The duties of the office were connected with the enforcement of escheats to the Crown, and the collection of the hated Poll Tax or Jizy\u0101.\n\nThe siv\u0101n\u012bh-nig\u0101r of the same page is for Siv\u0101n\u012bh-nig\u0101r, news-writer, an official who must be distinguished from the W\u0101q\u0101'\u012bh-naivis, the official journal-keeper or recorder. The latter prepared a gazette or record of official acts, changes of officials, and so forth; the former, the Siv\u0101n\u012bh-nig\u0101r, was a sort of spy or retailer of gossip and complaints. Both of these officials were in direct communication with the D\u0101roghah-i-d\u0101k (Superintendent of the Post) at the emperor's court, and they sent in weekly or fortnightly reports. On p. 289, under the date of 25th November, 1717, we see that when the mace-bearer (Gurz-bard\u0101r), a very important personage, arrived from Court with the imperial farm\u0101ns granted to the East India Company by Farrukhsiyar, the W\u0101q\u0101'\u012bh-naivis and the Siv\u0101n\u012bh-nig\u0101r both came down with other officials from Hugli, \"to take notice of Ceremonys and Respect we mett and received the King's favours with,\" and both received a present of broadcloth for their pains.\nDialogues of the Buddha. Translated from the Pali [of the Digha Nikaya] by T. W. Rhys Davids. Being Sacred Books of the Buddhists, volume ii. (London, 1899.)\n\nOne is sometimes tempted to wish that there might grow up a body of international law for scholars\u2014pandicea-dhamma, so to say\u2014which should provide, among other things, a pillory for those sinners against all the economics of scientific advance who edit texts and do not also translate them. The comprehending of a hard text and the editing thereof must proceed pari passu. When the editing is done, and well done, who in all the world is so well qualified to say what it means as the editor? His peculiar qualifications are the fruit of long and special study, and are often simply thrown away\u2014so far as his colleagues are concerned\u2014by his neglect to use them for the construction of what is, after all, the most convenient, the briefest, and the best of all comments, a good translation.\n\nI am convinced that Indian studies would have been a more important factor in the intellectual life of our day, and even that they would have made better progress, had the masters of Indology devoted more of their time to the work of translation and popular exposition. This work is too often left to second-rate men, and with results that are lamentable. \"What is the use of your erudition?\" \"What rapport can you establish between your department of science and the material, intellectual, and spiritual needs of to-day?\" Such are some of the blunt questions that confront the scholar of the English-speaking world, and that may not be ignored with top-lofty indifference.\n\nThe Parliament of Religions at Chicago in 1893 awakened great interest in the Eastern systems; and ever since that time there has been here in New England a steady succession of expositors and teachers of the religious life and\nbeliefs of India. There has come into vogue a dabbling with the 'isms' of the Land of the Rose-apple, which has often been directed or misdirected by worse than half-knowledge of what those 'isms' really signify. And its mischievous outgrowth has been a flabby mongrel eclecticism.\n\nVery timely, therefore, is the appearance in English form of such ancient and authoritative texts of Buddhism as are these Dialogues of the D\u012bgha Nik\u0101ya, and withal from so masterly a hand as that of Professor Rhys Davids. He, at any rate, has not shirked the work of translation, as no less than six volumes of the Sacred Books of the East attest. Thirteen suttas, or considerably over a third of the P\u0101li original of the D\u012bgha, were edited by him, with the collaboration of Professor Estlin Carpenter, about ten years ago; and a little earlier appeared Buddhaghosa's comment on the first seven of these suttas from the same hands. The translation before us just covers these first thirteen suttas. And it is most pleasant to learn from an incidental note on p. 239 that Davids has definitely planned to give us more (let us hope, the whole) of the D\u012bgha in English.\n\nSome of the suttas have an especial interest for us, in that they were among the very first Buddhist texts to become known in the West. The \"Perfect Net\" was translated by Gogerly over fifty years ago; and the \"Fruits of the Life of a Recluse,\" a little later by the great Burnouf, the version being hidden away as a kind of excursus to his note on the technical term kle\u00e7a, which forms the second appendix to his \"Lotus\"! Marvellous as are the erudition and breadth of grasp displayed in Burnouf's big quarto, it does seem as if a few compact octavos like the one before us, each laying before students of the Occident a distinct and important text, were much more likely to be of practical service.\n\nThe intrinsic interest of the D\u012bgha, however, seems to me, if I may venture so comprehensive a statement, to transcend that of almost any other scripture of the Buddhist canon. It is the last forty-five years of Gotama's life that\nmade it what it has been for humanity. Barren indeed they are of such striking incidents as form the themes of the beautiful and touching legends of his childhood and young manhood; but he was, above all, a great teacher; and it is his teachings, that is to say, the very essence of his life-work, that we find presented, with great directness, in the Digha and the Majjhima.\n\nThe translation premises some interesting general considerations concerning the Sacred Books. The Pitakas were known and regarded as authoritative at the time of the Milinda, say the beginning of our era. It is to the Five Nik\u0101yas that Tissa, in the Kath\u0101-Vatthu, which he wrote about 250 B.C., regularly appeals. In the inscriptions of the same date already adduced by B\u00fchler and Hultzsch (Epigr. Ind., ii, 93), the \"followers or reciters of the Five Nik\u0101yas\" are clearly mentioned; and A\u015boka's Bhabra edict recommends to the Order as especially edifying some seven passages, no less than five of which have been identified in the Nik\u0101yas. The method of Buddha's teaching has much that reminds us of the Socratic; and the essence of his doctrine was, in accordance with the usage of his day, couched in set forms or s\u016btras, which served as the themes to the endless variations which constitute the most striking stylistic peculiarity of the Buddhist literature. At Buddha's death, his \u0101rya were collected by his disciples and form the substance of the Four Great Nik\u0101yas (although hardly put into final shape till half a century later), and were so handed down for a couple of generations by oral tradition.\n\nMost illuminating is David's exposition (pp. 206\u20138, 232\u20133) of the attitude of mind in which Gotama conducted his religious disputations. He truly puts himself in his opponent's place; refrains from disturbing his prejudices harshly; makes the most of such points as are common to both; and thus, with marvellous patience and dignity, he leads the questioner on, until at last he has shown him \"a more excellent way.\" In the Kassapa-dialogue (p. 232, note) \"Kassapa uses the word Br\u0101hma\u1e47a in his own sense; that is, not in the ordinary sense, but of the ideal religieux.\"\nGotama, in his answer, keeps the word; but he means something quite different, he means an Arahat.\" Just such aper\u00e7us as these are most helpful; they do more than any dictionary or minute comment to effect for the young student of Buddhism in his new and strange environment what I may call his mental acclimatization.\n\nAs for the actual substance of the dialogues, although it cannot well be summarized, some notion of it may yet be given. Davids renders the title of the first as \"The Perfect Net,\" a happy version of a happy title: for in this dialogue the holders of the sixty-two \"views\" are completely enmeshed, as might be the fishes of a little pool which some fisher should drag with a fine-meshed net. The speculators whom Gotama here confutes are those who proceed from the traditional theory that there is such a thing as \"a soul,\" an individual entity, continuous, and separate from the body. The denial of this theory is (with the assertions that all things are transitory and that all things are misery) one of the three fundamental elements of Buddhist doctrine. The \"Net,\" therefore, very properly comes first; and, no less appropriately, the dialogue that aims to justify the establishment of an Order comes immediately after it, as second. That these two dialogues held a very important place in the oldest tradition is highly probable (p. 59). Ostensibly, the subsequent dialogues deal with less fundamental matters: the third is a question of caste; the fourth asks what is the true Brahman? the fifth, what the true sacrifice? the seventh, is the soul the same as the body? Others treat of the mystic trance, the miraculous powers, and so on; while the last is of surpassing interest in itself and as indicating that the flower of Indian mysticism was as full blown as the blossom of the monism of the Upanishads in Buddha's own day.\n\nThe lofty morality and noble thought of these dialogues constitute of course their best claim upon our interest, but not their sole claim. Incidentally they abound in matter of the deepest significance for the student of Indian history and antiquities. We have here a passage about the great\nheretics or Titthiyas, among them the famous Jains, Niga\u1e47\u1e6dha N\u0101taputta, p. 66. At p. 220, the translator discusses a curious list of ten classes of religieux from the \u0100\u1e45guttara; and in the Kassapa-sutta, p. 227, we have details of the strange vagaries to which the practice of asceticism led. The opening sections of the S\u0101ma\u1e47a-phala (which, by the way, have much of uncommon interest and beauty) yield a valuable datum as to the calendar and the beginning of the year in C\u1e5b\u0101vana, p. 66. Here, too, we see how the \"Three Refuges\" and the \"Five Precepts\" (p. 182) and the \"Noble Eightfold Way\" (p. 226) are represented as the immediate teachings of Gotama himself.\n\nThe translator fails not to bring out in a striking manner how much there is, commonly credited to Buddhism, which is in fact pre-Buddhistic: so, for example, the Four Raptures or Ecstatic Trances, p. 51. It is well that this truth should be recognized in its wider applications. Thus the tales of the J\u0101takas are not specifically Buddhistic nor Jains nor Brahmanical. The old motifs are simply Indian. It is only their setting that is essentially Buddhistic.\n\nA glance at the Index reveals the wealth of these texts in the most various data. The list of games, p. 9, is especially curious, and includes \"games on boards with eight or ten rows of squares,\" dicing, jackstraws, tip-cat, and so on. An attractive collection of the \"Similes\" of the text is made under that heading in the Index, p. 325. The excursus on names and nicknames, p. 193, makes all the more earnest our wish that the translator's Onomastikon may not be long deferred.\n\nThe annotations contain many valuable items supplementary to Childers. Meantime, pending the elaboration and publication of the extensive lexicographical material to which Mrs. Rhys Davids alludes on p. xcv of her Dhamma-\n\n---\n\n1 My friend Mr. A. J. Edmunds, of Philadelphia, kindly calls my attention to two most important Buddhist texts on Jainism, accounts of the death of Mah\u0101v\u012bra, the one at Digha 20, the other at Majjhima 104. These, not accessible to Jacobi in 1894, may be added to the texts given by him, S.B.E., 45, p. xv f.\nsangani, it would be a meritorious work if some young scholar should render usable these explanations of hard words now scattered through the Sacred Books of the East and various periodicals, by means of a simple and easily constructed index.\n\nMany questions concerning the history of P\u0101li literature almost settle themselves with the help of good translations; their Uebersichtlichkeit is so great a convenience that I could not be persuaded to the contrary by the most solemn assurances or contemptuous gibes of the best P\u0101li scholar living. That the value of the discoveries thus made is in no wise impaired by their obviousness is well illustrated by the K\u016b\u1e6dadanta, p. 173. This is essentially a J\u0101taka, with paccuppanna- and atita-watthu and samoth\u0101na complete, albeit with important diversities of form; and it is especially noteworthy, p. 164, as not having been incorporated into the J\u0101taka book.\n\nMoreover, any extensive and efficient comparative study of these texts in other versions such as the Chinese or Tibetan is of course impracticable save with the help of abundant translations. I have before me in M.S. an English translation from the Tibetan of the Brahmaj\u0101la by my friend the Hon. W. W. Rockhill. It would be most useful to institute a thorough and careful comparison. Thus the Tibetan cuts short at the outset the interesting C\u016bla- and Mah\u0101-s\u012bla, in order apparently to proceed at once to the first Bh\u0101ga-v\u0101ra, about the Eternalists; there are differences in the sequence of the doctrines confuted; and both the P\u0101li and the Tibetan have the same picturesque ending. But space forbids further discussion.\n\nAs I attach much importance to a due regard for the convenience and the eyesight of the users of a book, I cannot forbear thanking Professor Davids publicly for the pains he has taken to facilitate reference from the translation to the original and from the original to the translation.\n\n---\n\n1 See note to p. 240.\n2 Used, when they are used, of course, with the originals at hand.\nHis management of the repetitions, whether by reference looking backward or by skilful condensations, is marked practical good sense. I refer to p. xxi for his theory their origin and significance, and regret that I cannot report its substance.\n\nIf, as in duty bound, I must spie this notice with mention of a flaw or two, I will say that the book is places underpunctuated. Perhaps a pound of pica commas might have been put in to advantage. Doubtless some Professor Davids's friends have already chaffed him out over-frequency of his pet locution \"set out.\" On whole, I like \"The Exalted One\" for Bhagavant, when it is the Chandogya Upanishad or a Buddhist sutta that Englishing. Where capitals are used in rendering names like \"Great Wood\" or \"Gabled Hall,\" p. 197, I think the omission of the definite article would be a distinct improvement. As for an occasional misprint (concerning p. 211; niv\u0101ra, p. 233; \"398\" for \"389,\" p. 45) I remember that B\u00f6htlingk once told me that he believed in leaving a few any way\u2014for the critics, I think he or (to put it in Vedic phrase) as a sop to the Dogs of Y\u0101na. Besides, Davids will retort, \"The better is the foe of good!\" and who am I that I should answer him on point?\n\nBut enough. Let me end by calling attention once more to the lofty antithesis of religion and dogma which infects the argumentations of the Digha; to the gentleness dignity of the Teacher's spirit; and to the metta which naught else than St. Paul's \u1f00\u03b3\u03ac\u03c0\u03b7, \"that suffereth long, is kind, seeketh not her own, thinketh no evil.\" The much of the book may be read with profit as a guide of Would that our modern Jingoists might take a lesson from\n\nC.

Keith, who has taken his degree in Sanskrit and Pali at Oxford, is now engaged there in preparing a catalogue of the Hultzsch Collection of MSS. in the Bodleian Library.\n\nTHE GOLD MEDAL.\n\nOn July 11th His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales presented the Jubilee Gold Medal for 1900 to Dr. E. W. West. The presentation took place at Marlborough House. There were present\u2014Lord Reay, President; Sir Charles Lyall, Sir F. Goldsmid, and Sir W. Lee Warner, Vice-Presidents; and the following Members of Council: Mr. Arbuthnot, Mr. Brandreth, Dr. Cust, Mr. Fleet, Dr. Gaster, Mr. Kay, Mr. Lyon, Professor Macdonell, Dr. Thornton, Mr. Wollaston, and the Secretary, Professor Rhys Davids.\n\nHis Royal Highness said:\n\nThe Royal Asiatic Society has founded a Gold Medal for Oriental scholarship, and has chosen as the medallist for this year Dr. E. W. West, who, born in 1824, was employed as civil engineer in the Bombay Presidency from 1844 to 1866. His duties taking him near the Buddhist cave\ntemples of which there are so many near the Western\nal, Mr. West became interested in the inscriptions.\norder to understand them he studied Pali; and his\nt scholarly work was a glossary of words in the great\nnicle, The Mah\u0101 Vamsa of Ceylon, written in Pali:\nwas never published. But Mr. West published in 1861\nand 1862 in the Journal of the Bombay Branch of the\nRoyal Asiatic Society, facsimiles of the inscriptions he had\ncopied at the Kanheri and Nasik Caves.\n\nShortly after this, however, Mr. West's attention was\nattracted to the records of the Zoroastrian religion in the\nAvesta and Pahlavi dialects of ancient Persia. On his\nretirement from active service, in 1866, he spent three\nyears at M\u00fcnchen\u2014there was no provision in England for\nthe purpose\u2014in studying with Professor Haug these ancient\nrecords. In 1870 he published, at his own expense, the\nMainyo-i-Khard (or \"Spirit of Wisdom\"), and in 1872,\nin conjunction with Professor Haug, three other old Persian\ntexts.\n\nHe then began to work at translations, and from 1880 to\n1897 published five volumes in the Oxford series of trans-\nlations of the Sacred Books of the East, all these being from\nthe Pahlavi. Dr. West is acknowledged to be the greatest\nliving authority on Pahlavi literature; and the elaborate\nintroductions and notes to the texts he had thus been the\nfirst to render into English are a mine of information on\nthe history of the Zoroastrian faith and on the very difficult\nliterature in which the remains of its ancient records are\npreserved. No one else could have done the work he has\ndone so well \u2014 work distinguished not only by unique\nknowledge, but by a sobriety of judgment most important\nfor a solution of the historical problems involved.\n\nDr. E. W. West is an Honorary Doctor of Philosophy\nin the University of M\u00fcnchen, an Honorary Member of the\nAmerican Oriental Society, and a Corresponding Member\nof the Bavarian Royal Academy of Sciences. Besides\nthe above works, Dr. West has published a History of\nPahlavi literature in the Grundriss der Iranischen Philologie\nand numerous articles in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nI have very much pleasure in handing to you, Dr. West, this Medal, awarded to you by the Society in consideration of your distinguished services to the objects the Society was founded to promote.\n\nHis Royal Highness then handed the Medal to Dr. E. W. West; and the President, on behalf of the Council, gave expression to its most respectful and grateful thanks for the honour thus conferred by His Royal Highness upon the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nAN INTERESTING CEREMONY AT JUNAGADH.\u00b9\n\nOn Monday, the 4th inst., Colonel C. W. H. Sealy, Alienation Settlement Officer, Junagadh State, laid the foundation-stone of the building to be erected over the ancient rock-inscriptions of Asoka, Rudrad\u0101ma, and Skanda-gupta, on the way to the Girnar Hills.\n\nH.H. the late Nawab Saheb, Mahabatkanji, K.C.S.I., the father of the present Nawab Saheb, had erected a small building over the rock to save the inscriptions from the ravages of time. This was done twenty years back; but H.H., moved by the reverence-inspiring suggestions of the Sanskrit scholars and other eminent personages who visited this place, decided some time ago to get a more suitable building put up over the rock in keeping with its world-wide renown and historic importance.\n\nThere was a pretty large gathering in the pandal of Amirs, officials of the State, and several Shethias, who had commenced to arrive from 5 p.m., and by the time H.H. Nawab Saheb Sir Rasulkhanji, accompanied by the Heir Apparent, Vali-e-hed Sher Zumakhanji, Madar-ul-Maham\n\n\u00b9 Abridged from The Kathiawar Times of June 9th, 1900.\nVizier Baha-ud-deen-bhai, C.I.E., and Diwan Rao Bahadur Chunilal, arrived, the Shamiana was filled with audience spectators. His Highness and suite were shortly followed by Colonel Sealy, accompanied by the Naib Diwan Khan Dastagah Parushottamrai Jhala.\n\nThe Diwan Sahib Khasusist Dastagah, Rao Bahadur Chunilal Sarabhai, addressed Colonel Sealy on behalf of His Highness as under:\u2014\n\nColonel Sealy,\u2014I am desired by His Highness the Naib Diwan Sahib to express to you the great pleasure it has given him to learn that you have, in compliance with His Highness' wishes, kindly consented to lay the foundation-stone of a more suitable building which His Highness intends to erect over the world-renowned rock-inscriptions of Asoka, Rudradama, and Skandagupta, which have from times immemorial graced this city, and which form an object of unabated interest to visitors and men of letters in all quarters of the globe.\n\nThe edicts of Asoka, preaching as they do unreserved tolerance, universal benevolence, moral obligation, etc., have justly been held in veneration by successive generations; and many of the distinguished savants who have from time to time visited this place expressed a desire to have these precious relics of antiquity housed in an elegant building. His Highness' eminent friend and well-wisher, Sir Charles Ollivant, who has been Political Agent of the Province, and is now a Member of the Executive Council of Excellency the Governor of Bombay, was also desirous, with his wonted well-known keen interest in matters of history, ancient and modern, of Gujarat and Kathiawad, to see that a befitting building was erected over this rare treasure.\n\nThe idea of such a building was uppermost in the mind of His Highness, and enquiries were therefore at once instituted by the administration as to the nature of the building and the style of architecture that would best suit the purpose.\n\nThe design has just been settled, and now as your labour as Alienation Settlement Officer in this State have been completed and you are about to rejoin your appointment in the British Service, His Highness considers it most fitting in the nature of things that the laying of the first stone of the proposed building over these old rock-inscriptions should be performed by you, so that your esteemed name should be connected with the edifice which is to be the future receptacle of this glorious relic of the past.\nparticularly because in the course of your duties as Alienation Settlement Officer of the State you have often had to come across, decipher, consider, and form opinion on many ancient writings and learn in detail the past history of Saurashtra, because your services in this direction have been found to be very valuable and meritorious, and, above all, because you have always taken a warm interest in rare monuments of ancient history like the one we now see before us.\n\nThat the Junagadh State is keenly alive to the high value attached to these rock-carved inscriptions, which have withstood the ravages of time, will be amply testified by the fact that with a view to provide against future contingencies, and to leave to generations yet to come another memento (should the present one perchance give way in course of ages) of the past greatness of the Empire of which Saurashtra formed a not un conspicuous portion, arrangement has been made and the work is commenced to have these inscriptions copied on a rock of equal solidity which has fortunately been found in its vicinity, and to add to these inscriptions a short account of the present period.\n\nDuring the dire calamity and distress of the severe famine that we are on this side passing through, all that human aid can do to afford relief to the persons requiring it has been and is being done, and numerous works of public utility, varying in magnitude and importance to the ryots, have been started in different parts of this State; and it may be hoped that the advent of the monsoon, which we all look forward to so eagerly, and indications of whose near approach are already visible, will reopen the usual resources and avocation of those now labouring in distant lands for want of the same, and establish them once more in peace and prosperity in their homes.\n\nI cannot help adding that the pleasure of this occasion would have been much augmented by the presence of Mrs. Sealy, who is now in England, and who has with her genial and obliging disposition, her kind-heartedness and courtesy, willingly joined you in all social functions of the State during your stay here. His Highness regrets her absence, and hopes you will kindly convey to her his best thanks for the trouble she has taken on His Highness' behalf.\n\nWith these brief remarks, I request, on behalf of His Highness, that you will oblige us by laying the foundation-stone of the building.\n\nThe same having been translated into Gujarati for the behalf of the non-English-knowing members of the audience\nby Rao Bahadur Gulabdas Laldas Nanavati, our Judicial Councillor, Colonel Sealy spoke as follows:\n\nYour Highness, Wazir Bahauddinbhai Saheb, Diwan Chun Amirs, and Officials of the State\u2014\n\nGentlemen,\u2014Before proceeding to the ceremonial part of function for which we are assembled today, it will not be place for me to say a few words. And first I must thank Your Highness for the very appreciative terms in which you deemed fit to refer to Mrs. Sealy and to myself, as well as for very kind thought which has prompted Your Highness to this pleasant task to myself. I am quite sure that Sir Charles Ollivant will be gratified to hear of this day's proceedings, whom the State of Junagadh possesses no truer friend and wisher.\n\nIt is not for me to bring to your notice the terms of the edicts which are engraved on this rock before us. Those have been translated and commented on by numbers of distinguished archaeologists and savants, and there are, no doubt many among you who know a good deal more about them than I can profess to do.\n\nBut perhaps I shall not be far out in saying that those ancient though they be, preach a code of morality and civilization which is for all ages. The sword having been laid down, ruler of a vast kingdom has here indicated the direction in which his efforts were then directed, viz., in the amelioration of the condition of his subjects, the observance of charity and kindness men as well as to animals, and the encouragement to be given philosophy and morals.\n\nThat monuments of this kind deserve all the care that can be bestowed upon them is a self-evident fact, and when such authority as His Excellency the Viceroy has spoken on the subject it is unnecessary for me to add anything.\n\nBut I think it is a happy coincidence that this day's ceremony should be synchronous with what we all hope will be the termination of a famine than which none sorer has afflicted this province within the memory of living men. If the grievous affliction, which has visited Kathiawad in common with Gujarat and other larger tracts of country, has taught both rulers and ruled a lesson more than another, it is, perhaps, the entire mutual dependence of the one upon the other. Without his patient the chief cannot obtain the sinews of war or the means to ad\nthe arts of peace, and without the application of such means to useful public works the condition of the ryot can never be ameliorated.\n\nI therefore look upon this day's ceremony as an indication that Your Highness intends to carry on the beneficent ideas of the famous Asoka, of which good intention so many examples already exist in this State, and more especially in its capital. The famine has necessitated the undertaking of numerous works of improvement, all tending more or less to the benefit of the poorer classes of the community, and if it has opened the eyes of the cultivating class to the necessity of making the utmost use of the means in their power and the desirability of laying up something in times of prosperity for days of adversity, the visitation will be a blessing in disguise.\n\nIn conclusion, I will take this opportunity of declaring the regret with which I see my connection with this State severed. It is a State of peculiar interest to all connected with Kathiawad, and I need hardly say that during our stay therein Mrs. Sealy and I have received every attention and consideration from Your Highness and all your officers with whom it has been our fortune to come in contact, and we shall always look back to our stay in Junagadh with particular satisfaction.\n\nAnd now, Your Highness, I am entirely at your disposal to carry out what is required of me.\n\nThe above having been explained to the audience in Gujarati by Rao Bahadur Gulab Das, His Highness took Colonel Sealy to the place where the foundation-stone was to be laid, which, on being done, the band struck up a few notes of joy, as the usual declaration of the foundation-stone being well and truly laid was made, and on their return to the Shamiana bouquets and garlands of flowers, attar and pan supari, were distributed.\n\nColonel Sealy then drove back to his bungalow, accompanied by the Naib Dewan, while His Highness the Nawab Saheb, the Vizier Saheb, and the Divan drove to the Bhavnath Relief Camp and works at the foot of the Girnar, where there have been a poor-house having about one thousand inmates and about six thousand relief-seekers, working for nearly eight months past.\nRoyal Asiatic Society.\n\nGOLD MEDAL FUND.\n\nIn 1897 the Council of the Royal Asiatic Society established a Jubilee Gold Medal, to be awarded every third year, as an encouragement to Oriental learning amongst English-speaking people throughout the world; and to meet the expense contributions were invited from those interested in the scheme.\n\nA beautiful design was prepared, and dies engraved, by Mr. Pinches; the first Medal was awarded, on the report of a Committee of Selection, to Professor Cowell, and was presented to him by Lord Reay at a Special General Meeting of the Society, the proceedings of which will be found reported in the Journal for July, 1898. The second Medal was bestowed upon Dr. E. W. West, and presented to him at Marlborough House on the 11th of July, 1900, by H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, a Vice-Patron of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nThe subscriptions (including interest on deposits) amounted to \u00a3418 10s. 5d., and the disbursements (including cost of die) to \u00a3100 16s. 11d., leaving a balance (after providing the Medal for 1897 and for the present year) of \u00a3347 13s. 6d., of which amount \u00a3343 13s. 6d. was expended in the purchase of \u00a3325 Nottingham Corporation 3 per cent. Irredeemable Stock (a Trustee Stock), and there is therefore a sum in hand of \u00a34 0s. 0d. The amount invested forms an Endowment Fund which will produce an income of \u00a39 15s. 0d. per annum. As this provides the amount which will be required, the Fund in question is complete, and the subscription lists will be closed so soon as all outstanding donations have been received.\n\nA. N.

Gooneratne, Esq., Atapattu Mudaliyar, Galle.\n\nThis Society has been started in order to render accessible to students the rich stores of the earliest Buddhist literature now lying unedited and practically unused in the various MSS. scattered throughout the University and other Public Libraries of Europe.\n\nThe historical importance of these Texts can scarcely be exaggerated, either in respect of their value for the history of folk-lore, or of religion, or of language. It is already certain that they were all put into their present form within a very limited period, probably extending to less than a century and a half (about B.C. 400\u2013250). For that period they have preserved for us a record, quite uncontaminated by filtration through any European mind, of the every-day beliefs and customs of a people nearly related to ourselves, just as they were passing through the first stages of civilization. They are our best authorities for the early history of that interesting system of religion so nearly allied to some of the latest speculations among ourselves, and which has influenced so powerfully, and for so long a time, so great a portion of the human race\u2014the system of religion which we now call Buddhism. The sacred books of the early Buddhists have preserved to us the sole record of the only religious\nmovement in the world's history which bears any close resemblance to early Christianity. In the history of speech they contain unimpeachable evidence of a stage in language midway between the Vedic Sanskrit and the various modern forms of speech in India. In the history of Indian literature there is nothing older than these works, excepting only the Vedic writings; and all the later classical Sanskrit literature has been profoundly influenced by the intellectual struggle of which they afford the only direct evidence. It is not, therefore, too much to say that the publication of this unique literature will be no less important for the study of history\u2014whether anthropological, philological, literary, or religious\u2014than the publication of the Vedas has already been.\n\nThe whole will occupy about nine or ten thousand pages 8vo. Of these 7,200 pages have already appeared. The accession of about fifty new members would make it possible to issue 1,000 pages every year.\n\nThe Subscription to the Society is only One Guinea a year, or Five Guineas for six years, payable in advance. Each subscriber receives, post free, the publications of the Society, which cost a good deal more than a guinea to produce.\n\nIt is hoped that persons who are desirous to aid the publication of these important historical texts, but who do not themselves read P\u0101li, will give Donations to be spread if necessary over a term of years. Nearly \u00a3400 has already been thus given to the Society by public-spirited friends of historical research.\n\n* * * Subscriptions for 1901 are due, and it is earnestly requested that subscribers will send in their payments without putting the Chairman to the expense and trouble of personally asking for them. All who can conveniently do so should send the Five Guineas for six years, to their own benefit and that of the Society also.\n\nThe Society keeps no books, and its publications cannot in any case be sent to subscribers who have not already paid their subscriptions for the year.\n\nCheques and Post Office Orders should be made payable to the \"P\u0101li Text Society.\" (Address: 22, Albermarle Street, London, W.)\nLIST OF THE MEMBERS\nOF THE\nROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY\nOF\nGREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND:\n\nFOUNDED, March, 1823.\n\nCORRECTED TO 1st JANUARY, 1900.\n\n22, ALBEMARLE STREET,\nLONDON.\nTHE RIGHT HON.
