[{"id": "f7894cea320a24641d06eb3f1b0ce84d9aea5a76", "text": "Balasor.\u2014District in Orissa, under the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, lying between $20^\\circ 43' 50''$ and $21^\\circ 56' 30''$ N. lat., and between $86^\\circ 18' 40''$ and $87^\\circ 31' 20''$ E. long.; area, 2066 square miles; population, according to the Census of 1881, 945,280 souls. It is bounded on the north by Midnapur District and the Tributary State of Morbhanj; on the east by the Bay of Bengal; on the south by Cuttack District, the Baitaran\u00ed river forming the boundary line; and on the west by the Tributary States of Keunjhar, Nilgiri, and Morbhanj. The administrative head-quarters are at Balasor town, on the Bur\u00e1balang river. Balasor derives its name from Bal-eswara, 'The Young Lord,' or 'Lord of Strength,' i.e. Krishna; or perhaps from Ban-eswara, 'The Forest Lord,' i.e. Mah\u00e1dev\u00e1. The administrative head-quarters of the District are at Balasor town.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Balasor District consists of a strip of alluvial land, lying between the hills which rise from the western boundary and the sea on the east. This strip varies in breadth from about 12 to 44 miles, and is divided into three well-defined tracts\u2014the Salt Tract, nearest the coast; the Arable Tract, which constitutes the largest part of the District; and the Submontane or Jungle Tract. The Salt Tract extends along the coast, forming a strip a few miles broad, traversed by sluggish streams of brackish water, and clothed here and there with scrubby vegetation. Near the sea, the land rises into ridges from 50 to 80 feet high, and the western portion of the tract is covered with coarse long grass, which harbours large numbers of wild animals. Inland, the plain spreads out into prairies of coarse long grass and scrub jungle, which harbour numerous wild animals; but throughout this region there is scarcely a hamlet, and only a patch of rice cultivation.\nat long intervals. Towards the coast, the soil has a distinctly saline taste, and the manufacture of salt is carried on to a considerable extent. The Arable Tract, which adjoins this sandy strip, is a dead level of rice-fields; the soil is lighter in colour and more friable than that of Bengal generally. There is no forest throughout this tract, and the only trees are those which cluster round the villages, with a few scattered clumps of palms and screw-pines. The Submontane Tract is undulating, with a red soil, much broken up into ravines along the base of the hills. Masses of laterite, buried in hard ferruginous clay, appear above the surface as rocks or slabs. At Kop\u00e1ri, in kil\u00e1 Ambohat\u00e1, about two square miles are almost paved with such slabs, dark red in colour, perfectly flat, and polished like plates of iron. A thousand mountain torrents have scooped out for themselves picturesque ravines, clothed with an ever fresh verdure of prickly thorns, stunted, gnarled shrubs, and here and there a noble forest tree. Large tracts are covered with s\u00e1l jungle, which nowhere, however, attains to any great height. Balasor is watered by five principal rivers\u2014the Subarnarekha ('Streak of Gold'), the Panchpara, the Burabalang ('Old Twister'), the Kansbans, and the Baitarani (the Styx of Hindu mythology). The Subarnarekh\u00e1 enters Balasor from Midnapur District, and after flowing a tortuous southern course with gigantic bends east and west, falls into the Bay of Bengal. The river is navigable by country craft as far as K\u00e1l\u00edk\u00e1pur, 16 miles from its mouth. It is nowhere fordable within Balasor District during the rainy months. The P\u00e1nchp\u00e1r\u00e1 is formed by the junction of an intricate network of small streams, of which the most noteworthy are the Jamir\u00e1, the B\u00e1ns, and the Bhairingi, which unite, bifurcate, and reunite till they fall into the sea in one channel. The tide runs up for ten miles. One of the channels, the B\u00e1ns, is deep enough at certain parts of its course for boats of four tons burthen all the year round. The Bur\u00e1balang rises among the Morbhanj hills, and after an extremely tortuous course across Balasor District, during which it receives two small tributaries, also falls into the Bay of Bengal. The river is navigable by brigs, sloops, and sea-going steamers as far as the town of Balasor, about 16 miles up its tortuous course; but the entrance to the river is difficult owing to the sandbar across its mouth. The Kansb\u00e1ns is only navigable for a few miles, and is notorious in the District for its sudden floods and the large extent of country which it submerges in the rainy weather. The Baitarani, which forms the boundary-line between Balasor and Cuttack, becomes the Dhamr\u00e1 five miles from its mouth, at its junction with the Br\u00e1hmani from the Cuttack side. The Baitaran\u00ed receives on its Balasor side two tributaries, the S\u00e1land\u00ed (or, more properly, S\u00e1lnad\u00ed) and the Mata\u00ed. Reference has been made to the sandbar at the mouth of the Bur\u00e1balang; similar obstructions block\nthe entrances to the other Balasor rivers, seriously interfering with, or entirely preventing, navigation. The question of devising means for the removal of these bars and the prevention of their re-formation, has engaged the anxious consideration of Government; but the problem has not yet been solved.\n\nPorts and Harbours.\u2014There are seven principal ports in Balasor District, the names of which, beginning from the north, are:\u2014Subarnarekha, Saratha, Chhanuya, Balasor, Laichanpur, Churaman, and Dhamra. Subarnarekh\u00e1 is situated on the river of the same name, and is distant about 12 miles from its mouth. It was at one time by far the most important harbour on the Orissa coast, and it possesses special interest as being probably the earliest maritime settlement of the English in Bengal. That settlement was founded in 1634 on the ruins of the Portuguese factory at Pippli. Its exact position is no longer known, but it is supposed to have been about 4 miles farther up the river than the present port. In the early part of the last century, the settlement was already in a state of ruin and decay, on account of the silting up of the river mouth. Owing to changes in the course of the stream, no stone remains to mark the spot where the famous port once stood. In the days of its prosperity, ships sailed from the sea right up to the harbour; now the sandy bar at the entrance of the river is all but bare at low water, and in the south-west monsoon the port is quite unsafe, presenting an exposed lee shore with breakers right across its mouth. Beyond the bar, the river is deep and clear. The place is at present frequented chiefly by fishing boats, which cruise along the coast in fine weather as far as Pur\u00ed. Concurrently with the gradual decay of Subarnarekh\u00e1, Chur\u00e1man seems to have risen in importance, and in 1809 the Balasor Collector of Customs described it as \u2018the most safe and convenient port on the coast of Orissa,\u2019 and stated that it \u2018carries on a sea-going trade exceeding that of Balasor.\u2019 Since then this port and Laichanpur, which is 5 miles north of it, have both succumbed to the common enemy\u2014silt; and the mouths of the nal\u00e1s on which they are situated are so nearly closed, that \u2018to steer a small jolly-boat into them and out again to sea requires careful watching of the tides.\u2019 These nal\u00e1s are branches of the same river, the K\u00e1nsb\u00e1ns, which bifurcates at a point 7 miles in a straight line from the coast. Laichanpur is on the northern of these branches, which keeps the name of K\u00e1nsb\u00e1ns; while Chur\u00e1man lies on the southern branch, called the Gamma\u00ed. These rivers will probably be still further closed by the Coast Canal, now (1883) under construction, which will cut directly across them. S\u00e1rath\u00e1 and Chh\u00e1nuy\u00e1 are similarly situated on the S\u00e1rath\u00e1 and P\u00e1nchp\u00e1r\u00e1 rivers at their point of junction. They are practically one port, and are navigable to points 8 or 9 miles from the sea in a direct line. Native rice sloops of as much\nas a hundred tons burthen can manage to get over the bar at high tide; and, once past that obstruction, there is no want of water. The banks are soft and muddy, and there is much difficulty in landing except at high water. The Dh\u00e1mr\u00e1 port, at the mouth of the river of the same name, is a good harbour, affording complete protection from the monsoon. It is visited by a considerable number of native vessels engaged in the Madras rice trade; and it is of greatly rising importance. The Dh\u00e1mr\u00e1 river discharges the united waters of the Matai, Baitaran\u00ed, Br\u00e1hman\u00ed, and Kharsu\u00e1 rivers; and the port includes the navigable channels of all the streams so far up as they are affected by the tide. These limits embrace Ch\u00e1ndb\u00e1l\u00ed, Hansu\u00e1, and Pat\u00e1mund\u00e1i, the two last being in Cuttack District. Ch\u00e1ndb\u00e1l\u00ed is situated on a high and narrow ridge of sand on the banks of the Baitaran\u00ed river. It has gradually become a trading-place of considerable importance, the traffic being chiefly by steamer with Calcutta. It is now the principal port in the District. The port of Balasor consists of the portion of the Bur\u00e1-balang river fronting the town of Balasor. It is about 7 miles from the coast in a direct line, but the course of the river is so tortuous that the distance by water is 15 miles. The navigation at the entrance is somewhat difficult, and there is the usual bar at the mouth, the depth in spring tides being only one foot, while high water gives a rise of thirteen feet. Both Balasor and Ch\u00e1ndb\u00e1l\u00ed are frequented by sloops from the Madras coast and Ceylon; and the inhabitants of the Laccadive and Maldive islands also depend principally on this District for their supply of grain. The import and export trade of the Balasor ports is steadily increasing. In 1878-79, the imports were valued at \u00a3358,294, and the exports at \u00a3492,483; in 1879-80, the imports were returned at \u00a3407,821, and the exports at \u00a3533,939; in 1880-81, imports \u00a3416,952, exports \u00a3473,320; in 1881-82, imports \u00a3876,306, exports \u00a3477,563. The great bulk of the trade is with Calcutta. The sloops used along the coast for local traffic are built at Balasor, but the number of vessels belonging to the port has diminished since Government abandoned the manufacture and export of salt. A detailed description of the Balasor ports will be found in an article in the Statistical Reporter for April 1876 (quoted very fully in the Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. xviii. pp. 252-262), from which the above information is mainly derived. See also the different ports under their respective alphabetical headings.\n\nHistory.\u2014Balasor was acquired with the rest of Orissa in 1803, since which year there have been many perplexing changes of jurisdiction. The first British officer in charge of the District, Captain Morgan, exercised authority between the coast and the Hill States, but all the pargan\u00e1s north of N\u00e1ngaleswar and S\u00e1tmalang were included within Midnapur, and the limits to the south seem to have been very ill\ndefined. In 1804, a Collector was appointed, with jurisdiction as far south as the Br\u00e1hman\u00ed river. From 1805 to 1821, Balasor was managed from Cuttack, and had no separate revenue officer; in 1821, the District was administered by a joint-magistrate as the deputy of the Cuttack Collector; and in 1827, it was made an independent Collectorate. But the interest of the British in the District dates from a much earlier period. Balasor town was one of the first English settlements in Eastern India. The story of its acquisition is romantic. In 1636, Mr. Gabriel Broughton, surgeon of the ship Hopewell, cured the Emperor's daughter, whose clothes had caught fire, and in 1640 he successfully treated one of the ladies of the Bengal Viceroy's zam\u00e1n\u00e1. When asked to name his own reward, he replied that he wished nothing for himself, but begged that his countrymen might be allowed a maritime settlement in Bengal. Accordingly, in 1642, imperial commissions were made out granting the East India Company a land factory at H\u00fagl\u00ed, and a maritime settlement at Balasor. A few years previous to this (in 1634) the first English factory had been established at Pippli, on the Subarnarekh\u00e1; but owing to the silting up of that river, it was found necessary to transfer the Pippli factory to Balasor. The latter place was at once fortified, and became in reality the key to the position which England has since gained in India. During the long struggle between the Afgh\u00e1ns and the Mughals, and subsequently between the Mughals and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s for supremacy in Orissa, the English steadily kept the footing they had obtained. Defended on one side by the river, and on all others by a precipitous channel, which had been deepened so as to form a moat, and further protected by the guns on its ramparts and the armed merchantmen in the roads, Balasor was safe from attack, and soon became known as the only quiet retreat in the District for peaceful people. Industry and commerce gathered round it, and manufacturing hamlets and colonies of weavers nestled beneath the shadow of its fortified walls. Very different was the position at H\u00fagl\u00ed, where the English traders were subjected to every possible annoyance and exaction at the hands of the Mughal governors. In 1685, our countrymen were forced into open warfare; and in 1688, Captain Heath of the Resolution, the commander of the Company's forces, who had in vain negotiated for a fortified factory on the present site of Calcutta, could no longer tolerate the state of affairs, and, embarking all the Company's servants and goods, sailed down the H\u00fagl\u00ed and entered Balasor roads. About 1700, the mouth of the Bur\u00e1balang river was beginning to be blocked with silt; and during the last century the river and sea threw up several miles of new land, leaving Balasor much farther inland than it was before. This silting up of the river mouth, of course, seriously injured the port; and the last blow was struck at its prosperity when, in 1863, the Government abandoned the\nmonopoly of the salt manufacture and trade. Meanwhile the English were firmly establishing themselves at Calcutta, and the commerce of Balasor and its importance were gradually transferred to that place.\n\n**Population.**\u2014The population of the District in 1872 was returned at 770,232, on an area the same as at present, namely 2066 square miles. According to the Census of 1881, it amounted to 945,280, or an increase of 175,048 (22.72 per cent.) on the enumeration of nine years previously. This large increase is not, as in some Districts of Bengal, more apparent than real, owing to defective enumeration in 1872, but is an actual advance of a population recovering during a series of prosperous years from the famine which decimated Orissa in 1866. The population in 1881 resided in 6331 towns and villages, and inhabited 160,799 houses; average density of population, 457.54 per square mile, as against 373 persons per square mile in 1872; number of houses per square mile, 81.13; number of villages per square mile, 3.06; inhabitants per occupied house, 5.88. Divided according to sex, there were\u2014males, 461,461; females, 483,819. Classified according to religion, Hindus numbered 915,792, or 96.8 per cent.; Sikhs, 47; Muhammadans, 23,804; Christians, 815; Buddhists, 4; Jew, 1; \u2018others,\u2019 4817. The chief aboriginal tribes in Balasor are the Gonds, who number 6290; and the Bhumijis, 2767. Among the semi-Hinduized aborigines the most numerous tribes are the P\u00e1ns, of whom there are 48,192; the Kand\u00e1ras, numbering 24,455; and the Ch\u00e1m\u00e1rs, or dealers in leather, 8,444. The number of persons of high caste include 119,373 Brahmans and 182,948 Khand\u00e1its or Khanda\u00edyats. The Khand\u00e1its, who are by far the most numerous caste in the District, are descended from the soldiers of the ancient R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Orissa, who kept up large armies, and partitioned the land on strictly military tenures. These soldiers were of various castes and races, the officers being of good descent, while the lower ranks were filled by men of humble origin. On the establishment of a caste system, they all took rank with the military castes, but the present Khand\u00e1its are for the most part hardly to be distinguished from ordinary agriculturists. The number of males in Balasor belonging to pastoral and agricultural castes is 172,200; belonging to artisan castes there are 47,595, including 65,268 weavers. There are 26,160 Hindus who do not recognise caste; the great majority of these (23,057) are Vaishnavs. The population of the District is almost entirely rural, the only town containing more than 5000 inhabitants being Balasor itself, with a population of 20,265. The only other places in the District worthy of mention are Bhadrakh, on the high road between Calcutta and Cuttack; Jaleswar, or Jellasor, on the Subarnarekh\u00e1, formerly one of the Company\u2019s factory stations; and Soro, on the Calcutta high road, about midway between Balasor and Bhadrakh. The towns and villages are thus classified in\nthe Census Report of 1881. Villages with less than 200 inhabitants, 4959; from 200 to 500, 1134; from 500 to 1000, 210; from 1000 to 2000, 26; from 2000 to 3000, 1; and 1 with from 20,000 to 50,000.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Rice is the staple crop in Balasor, as throughout the rest of Orissa; indeed, it may almost be called the only crop of the District, as it has been estimated that but one acre in a thousand of the cultivated area is sown with any other crop. The principal rice crop is sown in May and June; the reaping seasons vary for different varieties, the crops sown in high lands being repeated in July, August, and September; those sown on middling lands, in September and October; and the variety (guru) sown in low lands, in December and January. The coarse varieties of the grain are the most easily cultivated, but of late years the finer sorts have been more extensively grown than formerly. Manure, consisting of cow dung, ashes, tank mud, etc., is used at least once in five years, 10 cwts. being allowed for an acre of rice land. Rents vary according to the situation of the land (and its liability to heavy floods) and to the tenure on which it is held; the average rate for pal land, which produces the finer kinds of rice, and also bears a second crop, is 6s. Such land yields from 12 cwts. to 15 cwts. of coarse paddy, or from 7 to 10 cwts. of fine paddy every year, the average value of which may be taken as \u00a31; the out-turn of the second crop may be valued at from 12s. to 16s. an acre. Nearly two-thirds of the District is cultivated, and the remaining portion is almost all incapable of tillage. Wages, and with them prices, have much increased in Balasor of late years. The wage of a day-labourer, which was in 1850 1\u00bdd., and had in 1860 risen to 3d., is now 3\u00bdd.; and a similar rise has taken place in the wages of skilled workmen. The price of common rice in 1850 was 1s. 10\u00bdd. per cwt.; in 1860 it had risen to 2s. 3d. per cwt., in 1870 to 3s. 2d., and in 1880 to 3s. 6d. Owing to the extraordinary manner in which estates in Balasor are cut up, the condition of the peasantry is not very satisfactory. A single estate generally consists of several villages or patches of land situated in different pargan\u00e1s, quite separate, and often at a considerable distance from each other. Endless confusion regarding boundaries is, of course, the result. Further, a landholder cannot supervise the whole of his estate, and it is impossible for him to take an intelligent interest in it, or to do justice to the cultivators, who on their part must be satisfied with very small holdings, unless they are willing to hold under several proprietors, or to farm a number of scattered patches under the same landlord. Large farms are unknown; there are not in the whole District more than a hundred holdings of from 20 to 100 acres in extent, and about 60 per cent. are below 10 acres.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014The District suffers much from both flood and drought. The floods are due to the sudden rising of the rivers in the\nhills during the rainy season, and almost every year the waters of the Subarnarekh\u00e1 and the Baitaran\u00ed devastate large tracts of country. Protective works have been undertaken by Government at great cost, but the floods are quite unmanageable while they last, and the embankments which have been built are altogether insufficient for their control. The principal embankments are the Bhogr\u00e1i and Sals\u00e1 P\u00e1t, on the lower reaches of the Subarnarekh\u00e1. Droughts, due to deficient rainfall, occur from time to time, but fortunately the failure in the higher levels is often compensated by increased fertility in the plains. In years of flood, however, although the uplands are much benefited by the local rainfall, to which the floods are partly attributable, the extent of high land is so small that the increased fertility is by no means commensurate with the loss of crops in the low-lying tracts. Serious droughts occurred in the years 1836, 1839, 1840, and 1865. An account of the terrible famine of 1866 will be found in the article on ORISSA, and the reader who wishes to study the details of that calamity should consult the Report of the Famine Commissioners (folio, 2 vols., Calcutta, 1867). The number of paupers who died in the town of Balasor in the five months June to October was 8900. Situated as it is, at the north-west corner of the Bay of Bengal, Balasor is also much exposed to the cyclones which arise in the bay. These cyclones are generally accompanied by irresistible storm-waves, varying in height from 7 to 15 feet, which sometimes penetrate as far as 9 miles inland. Such calamities occurred in 1823, 1831, 1832, 1848, and 1851. In the severest of these, the cyclone of 1831, 26,000 persons were destroyed. Fortunately the two last cyclones (in 1872 and 1874) were not accompanied by storm-waves.\n\nManufactures.\u2014The principal manufacture of the District is salt-making, which is stated to have increased of late years. This manufacture is susceptible of unlimited development. It is carried out in the saline tract along the sea-coast, chiefly by means of artificial evaporation, the process being as follows:\u2014At the beginning of December, the contractor selects his locality about a quarter or half a mile from the sea, and engages a class of men called chuliy\u00e1s, or gangers. These men receive payment at the rate of 1s. a cwt. for whatever quantity of salt they turn out. They in their turn engage working parties of malang\u00eds, or labourers, who are paid at the rate of from 3d. to 4\u00bdd. a day. The ground is first marked out by a shallow trench, and the grass and bushes are carefully dug up and removed. A deep ditch is next dug from the sea, by means of which twice a month the spring tides overflow the salt field, and fill a number of reservoirs four feet in diameter and two or three feet deep. A mound of earth is then piled up to the height of two feet, and from three to four feet in diameter. It is next hollowed out into the shape of a bowl, plastered inside with clay, and furnished with a hole at the\nbottom, covered with a layer of grass six inches thick. The salt-makers fill this bowl with saline earth scraped off the adjacent land, and pour the sea water on it from the top. By the end of six hours, the water has drained through into a pit at the bottom, and runs down a thatched trench towards a reservoir, whence it is transferred to the evaporators. These consist of 160 to 200 little unglazed earthenware pots, fastened together by stiff tenacious mud, and holding two quarts each. The neighbouring plains supply grass for the fuel. Six hours' boiling completes the process. The brine, which consisted in the first place of sea water charged to its maximum power of solution by percolating through the bowls of salt earth, subsides into dirty crystals at the bottom of the pots. It is then ladled out. The whole process is as rude and careless as can well be imagined. The total cost of manufacture is estimated at 2s. 3d. a cwt.; Government duty, 4s. per cwt.\n\nIn 1881\u201382, the total amount of salt thus manufactured was 7,448 tons, yielding a Government revenue of \u00a340,552. In the neighbouring District of Puri, salt manufacture is carried on by means of solar evaporation, and a description of the process will be found in the account of that District. With the exception of salt-making, the only manufactures in Balasor worth mention are those of brass vessels, ornaments, and coarse cloth.\n\nTrade.\u2014The chief articles of import into the District are wearing apparel, cotton twist, piece-goods, and hardware among European goods, and of gunny-bags, cocoa-nut oil, ghi, drugs, and raw cotton, among Indian products. The principal export is rice, which in favourable seasons is despatched in enormous quantities, both by sea and land, the sea-borne trade having developed greatly of late years. Other exports\u2014hides, jute, oil-seeds, and timber. The total value of the imports into the Balasor ports in 1880\u201381 was \u00a3416,952, of which \u00a3222,717 represented wearing apparel or European piece-goods or twist and yarn. The exports for the same year amounted to \u00a3473,320, of which \u00a397,990 was for rice. The exports of rice in this year, however, were far below the average, which for the two previous years averaged about half a million sterling. In 1881\u201382, the imports were returned at \u00a3876,306, and the exports at \u00a3477,563 in value.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The early records of the District have been destroyed; but so far as can now be ascertained, the separate expenditure in 1804 on the civil administration of Balasor, then a Sub-division of Cuttack, was \u00a377, 18s. In 1880\u201381, the net revenue was \u00a365,470, and the net civil expenditure, on officials and police, \u00a314,008. The land revenue, which in 1830 amounted to \u00a329,321, had in 1880 increased to \u00a341,069. In 1804, there was 1 permanent officer and only 3 courts of all kinds in the District; in 1880\u201381 there were 12 courts. At the end of 1880\u201381, the regular police force\nof Balasor District consisted of 475 officers and men, maintained at a cost of \u00a37445; a town police or municipal force of 30 men and officers, costing \u00a3228; and 2230 village watchmen, maintained by grants of service land or subscriptions from the villagers of an estimated value of \u00a32824. The average daily jail population during the same year was 100\u00b742, of whom 6\u00b738 were females. Until within the last few years very little educational progress had been made. In 1856\u201357, there were in the District 2 Government and aided schools, with 99 pupils; in 1870\u201371, the number of schools had increased to 28, and of pupils to 1252. By 1880\u201381, under the provisions of Sir George Campbell's scheme for extending the grant-in-aid system to elementary schools, the total number of schools of this description in Balasor under Government inspection had increased to 1447, attended by 22,737 pupils. Unaided inspected schools numbered 534. The Census Report of 1880\u201381 returned a total of 24,238 boys and 481 girls as under instruction, besides 30,022 males and 351 females able to read and write, but not under instruction.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The hot season, which lasts from March to the middle of June, is tempered by a cool sea-breeze from the south-west; the rains, which follow the hot season, last until the end of September. The average temperature in May is 98\u00b0 F., in April 96\u00b0, and in September and November 73\u00b0. The average annual rainfall is 67\u00b730 inches. The most common endemic disease is elephantiasis arabum, which is said to be always present in from 15 to 20 per cent. of the people. Skin diseases are common throughout the District towards the end of the rains, and after they have ceased, remittent fever becomes prevalent. Cholera is the principal epidemic with which Balasor is afflicted, and the disease is doubtless often induced by the stream of pilgrims which annually flows along the trunk road. Very severe outbreaks occurred in 1853 and 1866. [For further information regarding Balasor District, see my Orissa (2 vols., Smith, Elder, & Co., 1872) and my Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. xviii. pp. 247\u2013372; also Bengal Census Report of 1881, and the Report of the Bengal and Orissa Famine Commissioners, 1866.]\n\nBalasor.\u2014The head-quarters Sub-division of the District of the same name in Bengal, lying between 21\u00b0 3' 30\" and 21\u00b0 56' 30\" N. lat., and between 86\u00b0 23' 45\" and 87\u00b0 31' 20\" E. long.; population (1881) 519,707, comprising 501,315 Hindus (96\u00b74 per cent. of the Sub-divisional population), 12,826 Muhammadans, 749 Christians, and 4817 'others;' area, 1157 square miles; number of villages, 3369\u2014of houses, 88,557; average density, 449 persons per square mile; number of villages per square mile, 2\u00b79; houses per square mile, 76\u00b75; number of persons per village, 154, and per house, 5\u00b78.

In 1880-81 it contained 12 magisterial and revenue courts, a regular police force of 348 men, and a village watch of 1190 men.\n\n**Balasor.**\u2014Town, chief port, and administrative head-quarters of the District of the same name, Bengal; situated on the right bank of the Bur\u00e1balang river. About 7 miles from the sea in a straight line, and about 16 miles by river. Lat. $21^\\circ 30' 6''$ N., long. $86^\\circ 58' 11''$ E. Population (1872) 18,263. Population in 1881, 20,265, comprising 16,848 Hindus, 3068 Muhammadans, and 349 'others.' Area of town site, 5280 acres. The town has been constituted a second-class municipality under Act v. (B.C.) of 1876. Municipal income in 1880-81, \u00a3769; expenditure, \u00a3690. Among the articles of import are metals (used for the manufacture of domestic utensils and ornaments), piece-goods, cotton, twist, tobacco, gunny-bags, drugs, oil, sugar, seeds, etc. The chief export is rice. A description of the port, and an account of the rise and history of the town, will be found in the article on **BALASOR DISTRICT.**\n\n**Balasor (Banasura).**\u2014An isolated peak, 6762 feet above the level of the sea, in the range of Western Gh\u00e1ts, in Malab\u00e1r District, Madras Presidency; situated $9\\frac{1}{2}$ miles south-west of Man\u00e1nt\u00e1di (Manantoddy). Lat. $11^\\circ 41' 45''$ N., long. $75^\\circ 57' 15''$ E. Except on the lower portions, which have been cleared by the M\u00e1pl\u00e1s (Moplas) for coffee cultivation, the peak is densely wooded.\n\n**Balcha.**\u2014Pass in Garhw\u00e1l State, North-Western Provinces, on the Bashahr frontier, lying over the crest of the ridge between the basins of the Tons and the P\u00e1b\u00e1r. Lat. $31^\\circ 4'$ N., long. $78^\\circ$ E. Densely covered with deod\u00e1r forest. Elevation above the sea, 8898 feet. Close to this pass rise two streams: one, the Chak\u00e1r-ki-garh, flows west into the Koth\u00edgarh valley, near the Pabur river; the other, the Damr\u00e1ri-garh, flows into the Tons. There is excellent grazing ground for sheep in the neighbourhood.\n\n**Balchari (Bulcherry).**\u2014Island in Lower Bengal, on the western side of the entrance to the Matl\u00e1 (Mutlah) river, which it separates from the J\u00e1mir\u00e1. Lat. $21^\\circ 31'$ to $21^\\circ 35'$ N., long. $88^\\circ 31'$ to $88^\\circ 37'$ E.\n\n**Baldeva or Baldeo.**\u2014Village and place of pilgrimage in Muttra (Mathura) District, North-Western Provinces, situated in lat. $27^\\circ 24'$ N., and long. $77^\\circ 52'$ E. Population (1881) 2835. A modern town, so called from a famous temple in its centre, which is the daily resort of large numbers of pilgrims. A sacred bathing tank, the Khir S\u00e1g\u00e1r or Ocean of Milk, is situated close to the temple. The ancient village was called Rirha, and now forms a suburb of the present town. Two annual fairs. Government school.\n\n**B\u00e1ldi\u00e1b\u00e1ri.**\u2014Village in Purniah District, Bengal; distant about a mile and a half from Naw\u00e1bganj. Lat. $25^\\circ 21'$ N., long. $87^\\circ 41'$ E. The scene of a battle between Shankat Jang, Naw\u00e1b of Purniah, and Sir\u00e1j-ud-Daul\u00e1 (Oct. 1756), in which the latter was completely victorious. Shankat Jang\nwas killed by a ball while attempting to escape from the field. The account given in the *Sair-ul-Mutikharin* is one of the best descriptions of a battle to be found in Muhammadan historians.\n\n**Baleswar River** ('Lord of Strength').\u2014One of the principal distributaries of the Ganges; leaves the parent stream near Kushti\u00e1 in Nadiy\u00e1 District, Bengal, where it is called the Gar\u00e1i. Thence flowing in a southerly direction, it soon assumes the name of Madhumat\u00ed ('Honey Flowing'). It enters B\u00e1karganj District near its north-west corner at Gop\u00e1lganj, and from this point it takes the name of Baleswar, and forms the western boundary of the District, still flowing south, but with great windings in its upper reaches. It then crosses the Sundarbans, separating the Jess\u00f3r from the B\u00e1karganj portion of that tract, and enters the Bay of Bengal under the name of Haringh\u00e1t\u00e1 ('Deer Ford'), forming a fine deep estuary 9 miles broad. The river is navigable as high up as Morrellganj in the District of Jess\u00f3r by sea-going ships, and throughout its entire course by native boats of the largest tonnage. Although there is a bar at the mouth of the Haringhamh\u00e1t\u00e1 with only 17 feet of water at low tide, the navigation is easier than that of any other river at the head of the Bay of Bengal. The great banks or shoals which have formed at each side of the mouth, and which extend seaward for several miles, protect the entrance, and act as breakwaters to the swell. The river is not disturbed by the 'bore,' which visits the H\u00fagl\u00ed and the Meghn\u00e1, and it is also free from mid-channel dangers. Among its chief tributaries are the Kach\u00e1 in B\u00e1karganj, and the Bankana kh\u00e1l, Nabagang\u00e1, and M\u00e1chu\u00e1kh\u00e1l\u00ed in Jess\u00f3r.\n\n**B\u00e1li (1).**\u2014Town on the Dhalkisor river in H\u00fagl\u00ed District, Bengal. Lat. 22\u00b0 48' 50\" N., long. 87\u00b0 48' 46\" E.; population (1881) 7037, comprising 6564 Hindus and 473 Muhammadans. A municipal union, with an income in 1881-82 of \u00a3135.\n\n**B\u00e1li (2).**\u2014Market village on the right bank of the H\u00fagl\u00ed river, in H\u00fagl\u00ed District, Bengal, and a station on the East Indian Railway, seven miles from Calcutta (Howrah). Lat. 22\u00b0 39' N., long. 88\u00b0 23' E. Contains an academy for Hindu pandits. The village takes its name from a kh\u00e1l, or canal, 12 feet deep, running from here to the D\u00e1nkun\u00ed marsh west of Serampur station. A suspension bridge crosses the kh\u00e1l at B\u00e1li.\n\n**B\u00e1li\u00e1.**\u2014Village in Din\u00e1jpur, Bengal, the site of an annual festival in honour of Krishna.\u2014See Alawakhawa.\n\n**B\u00e1li\u00e1gh\u00e1t\u00e1.**\u2014Trading village on the Circular Road Canal, in the District of the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, Bengal. Lat. 22\u00b0 33' 45\" N., long. 88\u00b0 27' E. Principal trade\u2014fine rice imported from B\u00e1karganj and the Eastern Districts, and firewood.\n\n**B\u00e1li\u00e1gh\u00e1t\u00e1.**\u2014Canal in the District of the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, Bengal, extending from the old to the new toll-house on the Salt Water Lake, 5\u00bd miles in length.\nB\u00e1liganj.\u2014Suburb of Calcutta.\u2014See Ballygunge.\n\nB\u00e1lihatiam (B\u00e1lihattam).\u2014Village in Vizagapatam District, Madras Presidency, near which is a shrine of Siva as Brahmeswar\u00fadu, of peculiar sanctity. Lat. $17^\\circ 39'$ N., long. $82^\\circ 38' 30''$ E. The Sw\u00e1m\u00ed, or idol, contrary to usual custom, faces west instead of east. The river Panderu or Var\u00e1h\u00e1nad\u00ed, which washes the rock on which the temple stands, flows for some distance from south to north. This combination of directions is particularly auspicious in Hindu estimation, and the shrine, under the name of Uttara Vahini, is held in great veneration. On the river bank is a small bed of pulverized shale, which, from its resemblance to ashes, is declared by the priests to be the site of a sacrifice performed by B\u00e1lichakravarti.\n\nBalihr\u00ed.\u2014One of the oldest towns in Jabalpur (Jubbulpore) District, Central Provinces. Lat. $23^\\circ 47' 45''$ N., long. $80^\\circ 19'$ E.; pop. (1881) 2657, namely, Hindus, 2217; Muhammadans, 287; Jains, 151; and aboriginal tribes, 2. Formerly called B\u00e1b\u00e1vat Nag\u00e1ri, then P\u00e1p\u00e1vat Nag\u00e1ri, finally Balihr\u00ed, from the defeat here of a mythical R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bal. Others connect the name with a variety of p\u00e1n (Chavica betel); and even now the p\u00e1n gardens are numerous and beautiful. In ancient times, Balihr\u00ed was a flourishing city, 24 miles in circumference. It lay on the main line of communication between the valleys of the Ganges and the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda), and contained hundreds of temples, to which pilgrims formerly flocked from all parts of India. It is not now, however, a place of pilgrimage. An inscription found in an old building shows that the town was an early seat of Jain worship. Balihr\u00ed, with the pargan\u00e1 of the same name, probably belonged to the kings of Mandl\u00e1, till in 1781 they fell into the hands of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 chief of S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor). In 1796 Balihr\u00ed was presented to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gpur; and in 1817 was ceded by the Bhonslas to the British Government. During the Mutiny of 1857 the fort was occupied by a party of rebels under Raghun\u00e1th Singh, Bundel\u00e1; but they decamped on native troops being sent against the place. Soon afterwards the fort was entirely dismantled by order of Government. The present town is picturesquely situated among groves of mango and other trees, in a fertile country diversified by numerous hills. The large tank, fine old masonry wells, and many ancient remains are full of interest.\n\nB\u00e1l\u00edp\u00e1r\u00e1.\u2014Forest reserve in the north-east of Darrang District, Assam. Lat. $26^\\circ 54'$ to $26^\\circ 55'$ N., long. $92^\\circ 51'$ to $92^\\circ 52'$ E.; estimated area, 56,224 acres, or 88 square miles, to which is attached a plantation of India rubber trees.\n\nB\u00e1lirang\u00e1n (Bilisiri-rangan).\u2014Range of mountains in Coimbatore District, Madras Presidency, commencing in Mysore, and terminating at the Hussan\u00far Pass. Lat. $11^\\circ 40'$ to $12^\\circ 10'$ N., long. $77^\\circ 10'$ to $77^\\circ 11'$ E. The portion lying within the Madras Presidency consists of\na double range, the Coimbatore boundary being the western watershed of the Gundal river as far as Honnemetti; one part, running north and south, from lat. $11^\\circ 40'$ to lat. $12^\\circ 10'$ N., averages about 4500 feet above sea level, the highest peaks being on the eastern ridge and rising to 5300 feet; Bedugiri, the southern peak, is 5000 feet high. The valley between the two ridges, which is heavily wooded and frequented by elephants, is watered by the Gundal and Honnuhole streams. The hills are uninhabited.\u2014See Biligiri-Rangan.\n\nBalisna.\u2014Town in Kh\u00e1di Division, Baroda State, Guzer\u00e1t, Bombay Presidency. Population (1881) 5002, namely, males 2525, females 2477.\n\nBalkh.\u2014Province of Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n.\u2014See Afghan Turkistan.\n\nBalkh.\u2014City of Afgh\u00e1n Turkist\u00e1n, Central Asia. Balkh properly lies beyond the scope of this work, but as it has much interest as a seat of ancient civilisation, the following description of it has been condensed from Colonel Macgregor's account. It should be borne in mind, however, that no official authority attaches to articles in the Imperial Gazetteer dealing with territory beyond the Indian frontier.\n\nThe City.\u2014The famous and ancient city of Balkh has fallen to decay, and now consists of an old and new town. The ruins extend for a circuit of about 20 miles. They consist of fallen mosques and decayed tombs built of sun-dried brick, but there are no relics of an age prior to Muhammadanism. In its wide area the ancient city appears to have enclosed innumerable gardens, which increased its size without adding to its population; and from the frail materials of which its buildings are constructed, the foundations being only brick, it may be doubted if Balkh was ever a substantial city. There are three large colleges of handsome proportions now in a state of decay, with their cells empty; a mud wall surrounds a portion of the town, but it must be of recent construction, since it excludes the ruins on every side for about 10 miles. The citadel on the north side has been more solidly constructed. It is a square enclosure, with a turret at each corner, erected upon an artificial eminence; and this fortress, though entirely abandoned, is, as well as the mosques, colleges, and a long b\u00e1z\u00e1r, in very fine condition. Ancient Balkh stands on a plain about 6 miles from the hills, and not upon them as has been erroneously represented. There are many inequalities in the surrounding fields which may arise from ruins and rubbish. Forty years ago there still remained among the ruins many good houses; but when some of these fell down from the effects of rain, and exposed vases full of gold which had been concealed in the walls, the inhabitants of the south part proceeded to demolish everything that was left standing, in the hope of finding more treasure. In any case their trouble is not thrown away, for they sell the bricks to\nthose who are building in the modern town. New Balkh is open, with the citadel in the centre, and lies an hour's journey north from the old town. It is the residence of the governor. The population consists of about 10,000 Afghans, and 5000 Uzbegs of the tribes of Kapchak and S\u00e1bu, with a few Hindus, and about 1000 families of Jews. The former are shopkeepers, the latter shopkeepers and mechanics. Both are subject to the jaziy\u00e1, or capitation tax on infidels; the Hindus are known by a painted mark on the forehead, the Jews by wearing a black sheepskin cap. The population of the old town does not exceed 2000. The people of Central Asia have a great veneration for this city. They call it Amm-ul-Bel\u00e1d, 'mother of cities,' and believe that it was one of the earliest peopled portions of the earth, and that its re-occupation will be one of the signs of the approaching end of the world. Outside the city is the grave of poor Moorcroft, who lies close to his comrade Guthrie.\n\nThe Country.\u2014Many well-peopled villages are included in the government of Balkh, which is bounded by the Oxus on the north, and on the south by the chain of mountains running east and west, 15 miles from the town; in the other direction it extends from Bajar to Akchah. The territory of Balkh is noted for its fertility; water is abundant, and it only requires a numerous population to render it the most fertile in Asia. Even in its present state it is one of the most productive tracts in Turkist\u00e1n, being able to furnish several Provinces with grain when their own crops are insufficient for their consumption. The fruit of Balkh is most luscious, particularly the apricots, which are nearly as large as apples. They are almost below value. When Burnes was there, 2000 were to be purchased for a rupee; with iced water they are indeed luxuries, though dangerous ones. Snow is brought in quantities from the mountains south of Balkh, about 20 miles distant, and sold at a cheap rate throughout the year. The climate of Balkh is very insalubrious, but not disagreeable. In June the thermometer does not rise above 80\u00b0, but July is the hottest month in the year. The unhealthiness is ascribed to the water, which is so mixed up with earth and clay as to look like a puddle after rain. The soil is of a greyish colour, like pipeclay, and very rich. The crops are good; the wheat stalks grow as high as in England, and do not present the stunted stubble of India. The wheat ripens in July, which makes the harvest fifty days later than at Pesh\u00e1war. In Balkh, the water has been distributed with great labour by aqueducts from the river; of these there are said to be no less than 18, but many are not now discoverable. They frequently overflow, and leave marshes, which rapidly dry up under the sun's rays. This seems to account for the diseases of the place, for it is not situated in a country naturally marshy, but on a gentle slope, about 1800 feet above the level of the sea, sinking\ntowards the Oxus. All the water of the river on which Balkh stands is lost long before reaching that stream.\n\n**History.**\u2014On the death of N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h, Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Dur\u00e1n\u00ed gave the territories of Balkh to H\u00e1ji Kh\u00e1n, a soldier of fortune. His son succeeded him, but the inhabitants were encouraged to revolt by the Amir of Bokh\u00e1ra. Tim\u00far Sh\u00e1h Dur\u00e1n\u00ed then marched an army and reduced the place. After his death, Sh\u00e1h Mur\u00e1d of Bokh\u00e1ra laid siege to the city in 1793, but did not take it. From 1793 to 1826 Balkh remained under Afgh\u00e1n government. Mur\u00e1d Beg of K\u00fand\u00faz held temporary authority for two years from 1826, when, being dispossessed by the Amir of Bokh\u00e1ra, he carried with him a large number of the inhabitants to people his territories to the east. Balkh was then placed under the government of a deputy of Bokh\u00e1ra named Eshan Khoj\u00e1; about 1838 he was recalled, but Balkh still remained under Bokh\u00e1ra till 1841, when the Mir Wali of Khulm captured Balkh in the name of Sh\u00e1h Sh\u00faja. At the desire of the British Resident he restored it. From this time to 1st February 1850, it is not clear under whose authority Balkh was, but it is probable that neither the Amir of Bokh\u00e1ra, nor the Wali of Khulm, did more than claim sovereignty over it, and the city was constantly threatened by both. In February 1850, Muhammad Akram Kh\u00e1n, B\u00e1r\u00e1kzai, captured Balkh, and from that time to the present it has remained under Afgh\u00e1n rule.\n\n**Ballabgarh.**\u2014The southern tahsil of Delhi District, Punjab; area, 388 square miles; population (1881) 138,878, of whom 108,291 are Hindus. Land revenue of the tahsil (1883) \u00a320,943. The administrative staff consists of a tahsild\u00e1r and munsif, who preside over 1 civil and 2 criminal courts. Number of police circles (th\u00fan\u00e1s), 6; strength of regular police, 129 men; number of village watchmen (chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs), 280.\n\n**Ballabgarh.**\u2014Town in Delhi District, Punjab; head-quarters of Ballabgarh tahsil, and former capital of a Native State; situated on the Muttra road, 2\u00bc miles from Delhi city, in lat. 28\u00b0 20' N., long. 77\u00b0 21' 30\" E. The population, which in 1868 numbered 6281 persons, had in 1881, as shown by the Census, decreased to 5821, made up as follows:\u2014Hindus, 4464; Muhammadans, 1320; and Jains, 37. Number of inhabited houses, 924. Originally held by Taga Br\u00e1hmans, but acquired by purchase or force about 1740 by a J\u00e1t adventurer, whose grandson, Ajit Singh, obtained the title of R\u00e1j\u00e1 from Naw\u00e1b Najaf Kh\u00e1n. The R\u00e1j\u00e1's son, Bah\u00e1dur Singh, was confirmed in his estates by Lord Lake, after the British conquest in 1803. He also acquired the pargan\u00e1 of P\u00e1li P\u00e1k\u00e1l in 1805 as a grant for life, in return for police services on the Delhi and Palw\u00e1l road; and this grant was continued to his successor up till the year 1827, when the Magistrate of Delhi undertook the management of the police. R\u00e1j\u00e1 N\u00e1har Singh, the\nlast of his line, rebelled in 1857, and was executed for his disloyalty, his estates being confiscated by the British Government. Contains a small but pretty palace, numerous temples, tahsili, police station, dispensary, and schoolhouse. Brisk trade in food grains with Delhi. The town is constituted a third-class municipality. Municipal income in 1880-81, \u00a3401; expenditure, \u00a3367.\n\n**Ballabhpur.**\u2014Suburb of Serampur, in H\u00fagl\u00ed District, Bengal. Two festivals connected with the god Jagann\u00e1th, which are celebrated with great pomp here and at the neighbouring village of M\u00e1hesh, attract large concourses. The first is the Su\u00e1n-j\u00e1tr\u00e1 or bathing festival, which takes place in May, and lasts only one day; the second and more important\u2014the Rath-j\u00e1tr\u00e1 (car festival)\u2014is celebrated six weeks after the bathing of the idol. The god is brought out of his temple in M\u00e1hesh, placed upon a car, and dragged to Ballabhpur, a distance of about one mile. Here he is deposited in the temple of a brother god, R\u00e1dh\u00e1b\u00e1llabh, where he remains for eight days, when the ult\u00e1-rath or return journey takes place, the god being escorted back to his temple in the same way as he was brought out. A large fair, held at M\u00e1hesh at the time of the festival, lasts eight days. Business is combined with pleasure, and a brisk trade is carried on. The religious ceremonial is confined to the first and eighth days, when the idol is moved to and brought back from Ballabhpur. On these days the crowd is immense, having been estimated on some occasions to amount to 100,000.\n\n**Ball\u00e1lpur.**\u2014Village in Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 District, Central Provinces; 6 miles south of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 town. Lat. 19\u00b0 50' 45\" N., long. 79\u00b0 23' 15\" E. Population (1881) 790. It was the seat of an early Gond dynasty, and foundations of the old city can still be traced for a considerable distance in the jungle. Within a handsome stone fort, partly rebuilt about 1800, stand the remains of the ancient palace, including two tunnels sunk in opposite directions, each leading to a set of three underground chambers. North of the village are the ruins of a large and elaborate tank. To the east is the tomb of a Gond king; and in an islet in the Wardha, in the same direction, there is an exceedingly curious rock temple, known as the R\u00e1m T\u00edrth, which, during several months of the year, lies fathoms under water. A few hundred yards beyond the R\u00e1m T\u00edrth, in the bed of the river, a seam of coal has been laid bare by the action of the current. The village is picturesquely situated. It is surrounded by ancient groves, and the Wardh\u00e1 flows by in a deep, broad stream, between high and rocky banks. Police outpost.\n\n**Ballal-rayan-durga.**\u2014Mountain in the range of the Western Gh\u00e1ts, in Kad\u00far District, Mysore State; 4940 feet above sea level. Lat. 13\u00b0 8' N., long. 75\u00b0 29' E. Crowned by extensive fortifications, erected by a monarch of the Ball\u00e1la dynasty (10th to 14th century).\n\n**Ball\u00e1pali.**\u2014Forest reserve and timber depot in Cuddapah District, vol. II.\nMadras Presidency. The most remunerative wood is the 'red saunder's root' (Pterocarpus santalinus), used for dyeing, first-class specimens yielding sometimes 900 per cent. profit on cost of production.\n\n**Ballia.**\u2014A British District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the North-Western Provinces, lying between 25\u00b0 39' 30\" and 26\u00b0 13' N. lat., and between 83\u00b0 41' 23\" and 84\u00b0 40\" E. long.; with an area of 1144 square miles, and a population in 1881 of 924,763 persons. It was created on 1st November 1879 out of the eastern parganas of Gh\u00e1z\u00edpur and Azamgarh. Bounded on the north and east by the Gogra (Ghagr\u00e1), which separates it from Gorakhpur and the Bengal District of S\u00e1ran; on the south by the Ganges, which separates it from Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d; and on the west by Azamgarh and Gh\u00e1zipur. The administrative head-quarters are at Ballia town.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014This District, part of the great plain of the Ganges, lies between that river and the Gogra, just above their confluence. It may be divided into two nearly equal parts\u2014the modern alluvial formation, which lies along the banks of the rivers; and the older formation, inland from the rivers, comprising the western portion of the District, which is also an alluvium deposited in past ages under conditions which do not now exist. The older formation, or upland (though there is but a slight difference in elevation), is distinguished by its greater depth of soil, and by the invariable presence of kankar, a nodular carbonate of lime. Down the middle of this tract extends a long irregular piece of hollow land, deepening here and there into jhilis, and in the rainy season forming one continuous jhil, which culminates in T\u00e1l Suraha, a perennial lake about 4 miles in diameter. This lake is connected with the Ganges by a narrow, deep, and tortuous channel, the Kathiar Nadi, which admits the Ganges floods in the rainy season, and drains the lake when the river falls again. The soil of this tract is generally whitish in appearance, and is much subject in parts to efflorescence of rih\u2014an impure carbonate of soda, which creates barrenness in the soil. The modern alluvial tract is distinguishable into the older and the newer deposit\u2014that which is seldom if ever inundated by the rise of the river even in unusual floods, and that which is as a rule submerged during the floods of the rainy season. The great rivers which wind their way through the new alluvial deposits which they themselves have formed, carry on a continual process of destruction and renewal. At every bend, one bank is being eroded, and the opposite shore is receiving a new alluvial deposit to fill up the void left by the receding river. The encroachment, at first violent and rapid, becomes more slow and gradual in the course of a few years, and finally ceases; and then the current changes over to the other side, which is in turn diluviated. Thus, a site which 40 years ago was on the south bank of the Ganges, was found 20 years later to be several miles to the south of the river,\nand 20 years afterwards to be on the north bank. The alluvial tract is again distinguished according as it is created by, and subject to, the action of the Ganges or the Gogra\u2014the alluvial deposit of the former river being remarkable for its fertility and productiveness, while that of the Gogra is sandy and unfertile, and peculiarly unstable. Besides the Ganges and Gogra, the only river in the District is the Lesser Sarju, an affluent of the Gogra, which branches off in Azamgarh District, and joins the Ganges a little way above the town of Ballia. It forms approximately the boundary between this District and Gh\u00e1zipur.\n\nBallia is well wooded, abounding in groves of mango trees. There is no jungle, and no waste lands except in the upland tract, the barren patches liable to efflorescence of reh, and in the lowland some stretches of grass jungle along the Gogra. There are some nilgai in the District, but no deer or other large game. The grass jungle gives cover to wild hogs. The density of the population, and the comparative absence of jungle, have long ago driven out all the larger carnivora, and there is now no animal fiercer than the jackal and fox. In other respects, the fauna of Ballia is similar to that of all other Districts of the North-Western Provinces.\n\nHistory.\u2014The present District of Ballia corresponds to no ancient territory of separate historical interest; and its history is therefore comprised in that of the parent Districts of Gh\u00e1zipur and Azamgarh. It should be noted, however, that pargan\u00e1 Do\u00e1ba formerly belonged to Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d District in Bengal, and was transferred to the North-Western Provinces in 1818.\n\nArchaeology.\u2014There is a singular absence of any buildings of note either ancient or modern. Here and there, notably at Pakka Kot and Waina, huge mounds exist, which in the case of Pakka Kot are partly faced with brick, and are the remains of old fortifications attributed by tradition to the Bhars and Cherus\u2014the possessors of the country prior to its colonization by the R\u00e1jput tribes from the north-west.\n\nPopulation.\u2014Ballia supports a population of 924,763 persons, according to the Census of 1881, or an average of 808 to the square mile. It is the most densely populated District of the Province, except Benares, where the greater average density is due entirely to the inclusion of the large city of that name. Only 69,321 Muhammadans are returned, or 7\u00bd per cent., which is a considerably smaller proportion than for the rest of the Province, and shows the slight extent to which the Muhammadan conquest affected the general population. The Muhammadan community holds a very small portion of the soil.\n\nThe Hindu population amounts to 855,410, of whom R\u00e1jputs number 131,126, and form the great land-holding class. Even where the proprietary right has passed from them during the English rule by auction sale or private transfer, they retain their hold on the soil\nas privileged tenants holding at favourable rates. Each R\u00e1jput clan has its well-defined location, owning and cultivating that portion of the District which their forefathers conquered from the aboriginal tribes, or reclaimed from the waste. Thus, pargan\u00e1 Lakhneswar is held by the Sengars (population 17,139); Kopachit is divided between the Karcholias (10,410), the Kansiks (4955), and the Bisens (6352). The Birwars (7143), Naraunis (5707), Kunnw\u00e1rs (4587), and N\u00faikumbhs (3849) divide Kharid between them. The Donwars (7574), Bais (8108), and Barahias (7314) predominate in Sikandarpur, the Lohtumias (3742) in Do\u00e1ba, the Harihobans (2464) in Ballia. Most of the other clans, except those of small number, which are composed of recent scattered immigrants, hold their separate village or group of villages. Altogether, 69 clans were reckoned in the Census of 1881, excluding those composed of less than 100 persons. Br\u00e1hmans number 102,300, forming rather a larger proportion of the total population than is common. To a minor extent, the Br\u00e1hmans of this District are a land-holding class, but generally they hold as tenants at privileged rates rather than as proprietors. In manners, appearance, and customs they are scarcely to be distinguished from the R\u00e1jputs. Bhuinhars, a caste peculiar to the Benares Province, number 26,033. They are a kind of cross between R\u00e1jput and Br\u00e1hman, and, like them, are a predominant high caste and land-holding tribe.\n\nOf low castes, although Cham\u00e1rs (87,554) are the most numerous, the Bhars (58,147) are the most noteworthy, for they represent the indigenous population prior to Hindu colonization. Though classed as Hindus, the Bhars are outside the pale of Hinduism, and have their own peculiar traditions and religious rites modified, but not absorbed, by Brahmanism. Another noteworthy caste is the Dosadhs, who have almost a monopoly of the post of village watchmen. This caste is most numerous in the eastern pargan\u00e1 Do\u00e1ba, and was notorious for the predatory habits of its members, who used to form gangs of dacoits for the purpose of raiding into Eastern Bengal; and this habit they have not yet left off entirely. The other Hindu castes present no particular feature of number or predominance calling for special mention.\n\nThe towns of the District containing over 5000 inhabitants, according to the Census of 1881, are:\u2014Ballia (8798), Bansdih (9617), Reoti (9933), Maniyar (8600), Turtipar (6307), Rastra (11,224), Sahatwar (11,024), Bairia (9160), Sikandarpur (7027), Bar\u00e1gaon (10,847).\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The land revenue of the District is permanently settled, and the settlement was made with the land-holding clans of R\u00e1jputs, Br\u00e1hmans, and Bhuinhars. In the communities which engaged for the Government revenue, the proprietary right rapidly became much sub-divided, or passed away altogether by auction sale for arrears of\nrevenue, or in execution of decrees of the Civil Courts. In pargan\u00e1 Lakhneswar, held by the Sengars, there are as many proprietors as male members of the clan, and each proprietor has his holding scattered over several villages, and some have shares in each of the 134 villages of the pargan\u00e1. On the other hand, a single proprietor, the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 of Dumr\u00e1on, has largely added to his ancestral holding, and is now proprietor of nearly the whole of pargan\u00e1 Do\u00e1ba, and of half of pargan\u00e1 Ballia. Between these extremes, the land is held in every variety of tenure, and in areas more or less large by greater or smaller bodies of proprietors. The diversity in extent and complication of the proprietary rights only covers, however, a real uniformity in the nature of the agricultural holdings of the District. The land is held in small holdings mainly by members of the three chief castes above mentioned. Whether they pay rent to a proprietor or land revenue direct to the Government, or to one of their own body representing them before Government, is merely a detail affecting the amount of the profit they derive from the soil, and is not even a safe criterion of that. For the privileged tenants\u2014the tenants at fixed rates, whose rent-rate cannot be enhanced\u2014frequently pay less as rent for their land to the proprietor than in some villages is paid by the small proprietors as land revenue.\n\nChiefly under these proprietors and privileged tenants, but to some extent independent of them, are the holdings of the lower cultivating castes\u2014the Kachhis (called Koeris in this District) and others. In the methods of agriculture and in the crops grown, there is little special to this District. In the upland tract, in the hollow land, and along the jhils or marshes, much rice is sown, and is entirely dependent upon the rainy season, as is also the success or failure of the ordinary khar\u00edf crops. The rabi or winter harvest of wheat, barley, peas, etc., is largely protected by irrigation from wells and tanks, but in favourable seasons the winter rains suffice to mature an ordinary crop. In the alluvial tract the fertility of the soil and the certainty of the out-turn is much greater. Ballia has suffered from rainless seasons and drought, but has never experienced the extremity of famine. The low lands along the Ganges can scarcely ever fail to give their rich return to the easy labour of the husbandman; and where the floods of the river do not reach, water is readily found in shallow wells dug in the underlying sand, and is raised to the surface by the dhenkal or lever lift. Cotton is scarcely grown at all in Ballia, but the sugar-cane is a staple product in every village, and large quantities of sugar are annually made in the numerous factories which stud the District. Poppy is grown to a considerable extent, and occupies 6752 acres.\n\nOwing to the great pressure on the soil from the density of population, to the reluctance to part with land characteristic of small proprietors, to the generally great productiveness of the land, and\nto the very light assessment of the Government revenue, land in Ballia, for agricultural purposes merely, has a market value higher than in almost any other District. Rs. 200 per bigh\u00e1 (\u00a330 per acre) is not an uncommon price, and double that price is far from being unprecedented.\n\nCommerce and Trade.\u2014Ballia and Sukul Chapra on the Ganges, and Belthra (Turtipar) and Moniar on the Gogra, are marts for river trade, exporting sugar and cereals, and importing rice, piece-goods, salt, etc. But Rasra is the chief place of trade, and is the great distributing centre of the District for imported articles, especially iron and spices, and for the collections for the export of grain, sugar, and fuller's earth. Some of the District trade finds its way by road to Gh\u00e1zipur and Buxar on the line of railway, but most is taken by boat to Patna, or even farther down the Ganges. Traffic is much impeded by the absence of good roads. There are no metalled roads at all, and in the rainy season wheeled traffic is for the most part impossible.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The District staff consists of a Collector-Magistrate and two Deputy-Collectors. The civil and criminal jurisdiction is in the hands of the Judge of Gh\u00e1zipur. There are two munsifs located at Rasra and Ballia. The District is divided for fiscal purposes into the three tahsils of Ballia, Rasra, and Bansdih.\n\nThe land revenue in 1881\u201382 amounted to \u00a363,197, and the revenue from other sources, i.e. licence tax, local cesses, stamps, and excise, to \u00a333,020\u2014total, \u00a396,217. There is one Municipality\u2014Ballia town, which had in 1881\u201382 a revenue of \u00a3809; and there are eight towns under the Chaukid\u00e1r\u00ed Act, which are assessed at \u00a31256 for police and sanitary purposes only.\n\nThe total strength of the regular police for 1882 was 240 officers and men, and their cost was returned at \u00a33534. There is no jail in Ballia, and prisoners are sent to the Gh\u00e1zipur jail. The District contains 13 Imperial and 1 local post-office, but no telegraphic communication. In 1882 there were 83 schools with a total of 2551 scholars, and the expenditure of the Educational Department amounted to \u00a31046. There is one Anglo-vernacular school at Ballia; all the rest are elementary vernacular schools.\n\nSanitary Aspects.\u2014The District is similar to the border Districts of Gh\u00e1zipur and Azamgarh in point of climate. The extremes of heat and cold are less than in the more Western Districts. The dry west winds are less prevalent, and the rainy season is longer and the rainfall more abundant. No record of temperature has been kept. The rainfall for three years\u20141880, 1881, and 1882\u2014averaged 53\u00b73 inches. The birth and death returns cannot be accepted as accurate, but according to them the births registered in 1882 amounted to 26\u00b766 per thousand, and the registered deaths to 27\u00b751 per thousand. To European consti-\ntutions the climate is relaxing on the whole, but the natives of the District are rather above the average for physique and longevity. There are two dispensaries, one at Ballia and one at Rasra.

The soil is of modern alluvial formation, and a great part is subject to annual inundation from the two rivers. Area, 372 square miles, of which 280 are under cultivation. Population (1881) 345,373, giving the unusual density for a purely agricultural tract of 929 to the square mile. This tract is remarkable for its fertility. Land revenue, \u00a326,757, and, including local cesses, \u00a330,067; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a363,582; incidence of revenue, 3s. per acre. The tahsil contains 1 civil and 1 criminal court, with 4 police stations (*th\u00e1n\u00e1s*); strength of regular police, 61 men; village watchmen (*chaukid\u00e1rs*), 585.\n\n**Ballia.**\u2014Town and administrative head-quarters of Ballia District, North-Western Provinces. Lat. $25^\\circ 43' 55''$ N., long. $84^\\circ 11' 5''$ E. Area within municipal limits, 2484 acres, but these limits include the site of the great annual fair, and several villages adjacent to the town proper. The population of Ballia proper numbered (1881) 8798, namely, 7448 Hindus, 1349 Muhammadans, and 1 Christian. Including the neighbouring villages, the municipal population was 15,320. The municipality is administered by a committee of 15 members; municipal income in 1881\u201382, \u00a3809; average incidence of taxation, 1s. 0\u00bed. per head. The modern town is situated on the north bank of the Ganges, a little below its confluence with the Lesser Sarju. The old town was cut away between the years 1873 and 1875, and a new town has been formed a little farther back from the river bank. The District offices consist of a tahs\u00edli, civil court, police station, dispensary, Anglo-ver- nacular school. A great bathing fair, called Dadri, is held in November at the full moon of K\u00e1rtik, and attended by numbers ranging from 200,000 to 400,000. In 1882, 60,000 head of cattle were brought to the fair, which is at its full height for 4 or 5 days. Revenue in 1882 from the fair, \u00a3587, including \u00a3350 for taxes. The nearest railway station is Dumr\u00e1on, on the East Indian Railway, in the Bengal District of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, distant 13 miles.\n\n**Ballygunge (B\u00e1l\u00edganj).**\u2014Suburb south-east of Calcutta, situated within the limits of the Suburban Municipality, and a station on the Calcutta and South-Eastern Railway. There are a number of fine\nhouses occupied by Europeans; and the lines of the Viceroy's Body-Guard, consisting of brick-built ranges, with stables, are situated here. Police station.\n\n**Baloda.** \u2014 Town in Bil\u00e1spur tahs\u00edl, Bil\u00e1spur District, Central Provinces. Population (1881) 2492, namely, Hindus, 1858; Kab\u00edrpanth\u00eds, 237; Satn\u00e1m\u00eds, 103; Muhammadans, 178; aboriginal tribes, 116.\n\n**B\u00e1lotra.** \u2014 Town in Jodhpur (Jodhpore) State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, situated on the right bank of the L\u00fani; on the route from Balmer to Jodhpur city, 62 miles south-west of the latter. Lat. 25\u00b0 49' N., long. 72\u00b0 21' 10\" E.; estimated pop. (Thornton) 7275, viz. 6750 Hindus and 525 Muhammadans. Situated on the high road from Jodhpur to Dw\u00e1rk\u00e1, a celebrated place of pilgrimage in the west of Guzer\u00e1t, a stream of pilgrims annually passes through the town. To supply their wants there is an excellent market, and abundance of good water is to be had from 125 masonry wells. A fair, lasting 15 days, and attended by more than 30,000 people, is held annually in March.\n\n**Balr\u00e1mpur.** \u2014 Pargan\u00e1 in Utraula tahs\u00edl, Gonda District, Oudh; bounded on the north by Tulsipur pargan\u00e1, on the east by Tulsipur pargan\u00e1 and Basti District, on the south by Utraula pargan\u00e1, and on the west by Bahraich District. The country was conquered about the middle of the 14th century by immigrant Janw\u00e1rs, who founded the great Ikauna R\u00e1j. In the seventh generation from the original invasion, one of the Janw\u00e1r chiefs separated from his brother, the Ikauna R\u00e1j\u00e1, and expelled a caste of carpenters who held a tract between the R\u00e1pti and Kuw\u00e1na rivers. His son, Balr\u00e1n D\u00e1s, founded the town of Balr\u00e1mpur, and also gave his name to the estate. The small tract originally acquired was augmented by the conquest of neighbouring territory, although much of it was afterwards wrested from the Janw\u00e1rs by the Path\u00e1ns of Utraula, and the Bisens. One of the most celebrated R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Balr\u00e1mpur was Newal Singh, who succeeded to the estate in 1777. During his reign he was repeatedly engaged in hostilities with the Lucknow Court, and although often defeated by the King's troops, he was never subdued, and succeeded in keeping the assessment on his pargan\u00e1 at so low a rate as to amount to little more than a tribute. His grandson, the late Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1, Sir Digbijai Singh, K.C.S.I., came into possession in 1836. During the earlier years of his rule, he was frequently engaged in warfare with the neighbouring chiefs of Utraula and Tulsipur, and also with the revenue officers of the King's Court. On the outbreak of the Mutiny, Digbijai Singh, alone of all the chiefs of the Division, never wavered in his allegiance. He sheltered the English officers of the District within his fort, and finally sent them in safety to Gorakhpur. This loyal behaviour exposed him to the hostility of the rebel Government, and a farm\u00e1n from Lucknow divided his territories\namong his old enemies of Utraula, Tulsipur, and Ikauna. A rebel force marched into the *pargan\u00e1* to carry out the partition, but was called away elsewhere, without having effected its object. In the trans-Gogra campaign, which concluded the Mutiny, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Digbijai Singh joined the British force, and remained with it till the remnants of the rebel army were finally driven into Nep\u00e1l. As a reward for his distinguished loyalty, he was granted the whole of the confiscated *pargan\u00e1* ot Tulsipur, besides large estates in Bahaich District; 10 per cent. of the Government revenue on his ancestral estates was remitted, and a settlement in perpetuity granted to him. He also received the title of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1, and a Knight Commandership of the Star of India. The *pargan\u00e1* is a large one, comprising an area of 395 square miles, and consists of three well-marked natural divisions. (1) The tract lying between the R\u00e1pti and Kuw\u00e1na rivers, where the soil is generally a fair *dumit*, but poorly populated, and not under careful cultivation. (2) The *do\u00e1b* between the R\u00e1pti and B\u00farhi R\u00e1pti, which contains a few good villages, but frequently suffers from the floods of both rivers, which in many places join during the rains, leaving behind a barren, sandy deposit. Being higher at both extremities, the centre of this tract is occupied by an extensive grassy waste, which is for months under from 3 to 5 feet of water, and can only be reclaimed by the construction of expensive embankments. (3) The land to the north of the B\u00farhi R\u00e1pti, which is generally a fine clay, and well cultivated. Its most striking feature is the number of hill torrents by which it is intersected. Water exists everywhere near the surface, and is struck at an average depth of not more than 10 feet. Total area under cultivation, 191,451 acres, of which about 33,000 are under two crops; acreage under principal crops\u2014winter rice, 45,640; autumn rice, 28,000; gram, 76,635; *masuri*, 2581; and wheat, 48,725. The tillage is not usually of a high class, and rents are almost always paid in kind. At the time of the Settlement operations in 1871-72, the Government land revenue demand was fixed in perpetuity at \u00a323,709 (subject to a deduction of 10 per cent., as already mentioned), equal to a rate of 1s. 10\u00bdd. on the whole area, or 2s. 4\u00bdd. on the cultivated area. With the exception of a few small independent holdings, not amounting to \u00bd per cent. of the total area, the whole *pargan\u00e1* is the property of the heirs of the late Sir Digbijai Singh. Population (1881), Hindus, 163,541, and Muhammadans, 24,793 \u2014 total, 188,334, viz. 100,562 males and 87,772 females. The most numerous castes are K\u00farm\u00eds and Ah\u00edrs. Kshattriyas are unusually scarce; a few scattered houses of the old aboriginal population of Bhars and Tharus yet remain; wandering, gipsy-like people, known as Si\u00e1rkhawas, who live by hunting and in camps, are very common. The principal trading villages are Balr\u00e1mpur and Mathura. Besides two unmetalled roads, the villages\nare connected by rough cart tracks. Ferries are established at several points on the R\u00e1pti, and a stationary bridge of boats at Sisi\u00e1.\n\n**Balr\u00e1mpur.**\u2014Town in Gonda District, Oudh; situated on the north bank of the Suw\u00e1wan river, about 2 miles south of the R\u00e1pti, 28 miles from Gonda town. Lat. $27^\\circ 25' 30''$ N., long. $82^\\circ 13' 50''$ E. The largest town in Gonda District, and the residence of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Balr\u00e1mpur, the wealthiest of the Oudh t\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs. Population (1881) 12,811, namely, Hindus, 8639; Muhammadans, 4171; Christian, 1. Municipal income (1880-81) \u00a3343; expenditure, \u00a3420. Forty Hindu temples; 19 mosques. A handsome stone temple, dedicated to Bijleswari Devi, profusely carved by artists from Benares, has been recently completed. The b\u00e1z\u00e1r, which is new and commodious, consists of two cross streets, with the usual traders\u2019 shops. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s palace is an imposing pile, enclosing a large court, on one side of which are ranged the dwelling-houses and offices, and on the other the stables and outhouses. There is a daily b\u00e1z\u00e1r, and the market forms the centre of the rice trade of the surrounding country. Manufactures\u2014cotton cloths, blankets, felt, knives, etc. Large school, liberally supported by the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1. Order is maintained, and conservancy enforced, by a town police force. Good hospital and dispensary maintained by the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1.\n\n**B\u00e1lsamand.**\u2014Village in Hiss\u00e1r District, Punjab; 15 miles southwest of Hiss\u00e1r. Population (1881) 2067, chiefly Jats; second-class police station. A few years ago B\u00e1lsamand was becoming of importance as an entrep\u00f4t for salt from R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. A market was established, and several shops erected, principally by traders from foreign territory. The trade, however, was diverted from the town by the opening of the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na railway.\n\n**Balsan (Ghodna).**\u2014One of the Punjab Hill States, lying between $30^\\circ 58' 15''$ and $31^\\circ 7' 15''$ N. lat., and between $77^\\circ 24' 30''$ and $77^\\circ 35' 15''$ E. long. Area 51 square miles; number of villages, 152; number of houses, 1297, of which 1263 are occupied; population (1881) 5190, namely, 2878 males and 2312 females; persons per square mile, 102. Hindus numbered 5166, and Muhammadans 24. The R\u00e1n\u00e1, Dhop Singh, is a R\u00e1jput. Sentences of death passed by him require the confirmation of the Superintendent of the Hill States and of the Commissioner of the Division; other punishments are awarded by the R\u00e1n\u00e1 on his own authority. Balsan pays a tribute of \u00a3108 to the British Government, in commutation of an engagement to supply 30 begars or forced labourers. The State was originally a feudatory of Sirm\u00far (Sarmor). The estimated revenue of the Chief is \u00a3700.\n\n**Bals\u00e1ne.**\u2014Village in the Pimpalner Sub-division, Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay Presidency.

Although Bal\u00fach\u00edst\u00e1n lies beyond the limits of British India, some account of it may be useful to those who consult this work. It would be unsuitable, however, that any appearance of official authority should attach to this account of a foreign State, which has been confined to materials already published. With the permission of General Sir W. H. Green (the author), and of Messrs. A. & C. Black (the publishers), the article on Bal\u00fach\u00edst\u00e1n in the ninth edition of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica has been condensed in the following notice, as being the ablest concise account of the country which has yet been made available to the public. General Green kindly revised and made additions to this article for the first edition of the Imperial Gazetteer of India; and later information has been added in the present edition.\n\nThe frontier between Persia and Bal\u00fach\u00edst\u00e1n, drawn by an English commission, sent out in 1870, under Sir F. Goldsmid, runs from Gwadar Bay (about $61^\\circ 36'$ E. long.) northwards to lat. $26^\\circ 15'$ N., when it turns eastward to the Nihing river, following which, north and east, to its sources, it passes on to about $63^\\circ 12'$ E. long., afterwards resuming a northerly direction to Jalk. As thus determined, Bal\u00fach\u00edst\u00e1n has an area of about 160,500 square miles. It extends from lat. $24^\\circ 50'$ to $39^\\circ 20'$ N., and from long. $60^\\circ 40'$ to $69^\\circ 45'$ E.; its extreme length from east to west being about 550 miles, and its breadth about 370.\n\nThe outline of the sea-coast is in general remarkably regular, running nearly due east and west, a little north of lat. $24^\\circ 46'$, from Cape Monze, the extreme south-west promontory of Sind, to Cape Juni, near the river Dasht. It is for the most part craggy, but not remarkably elevated, and has in some places, for a considerable distance, a low sandy shore, though almost everywhere the surface becomes much higher inland. The principal headlands, proceeding from east to west, are Cape Monze\nor R\u00e1s Mu\u00e1ri, the eastern headland of Sonmi\u00e1ni Bay; Gurab Singh; R\u00e1s Ar\u00fabah; R\u00e1s Nu, forming the western headland of Gwadel Bay; R\u00e1s Juni, forming the eastern point of Gwadar Bay, and Cape Zegin at its western extremity. There is no good harbour along the coast, though it extends about 600 miles; but there are several roadsteads with good holding-ground, and sheltered at several points. Of these the best are Sonmi\u00e1ni Bay, Hom\u00e1ra, at Gwadar. On the latter are situated a small town and a fort of the same name, and also a telegraph station of the Indo-European line.\n\nHistory.\u2014Of the early history of this portion of the Asiatic continent, little or nothing is known. The poverty and natural strength of the country, combined with the ferocious habits of the natives, seem to have equally repelled the friendly visits of inquisitive strangers, and the hostile incursions of invading armies. The first distinct account which we have is from Arrian, who, with his usual brevity and severe veracity, narrates the march of Alexander through this region, which he calls the country of the Orit\u00e6 and Gadrosii. He gives a very accurate account of this forlorn tract, its general aridity, and the necessity of obtaining water by digging in the beds of torrents; describes the food of the inhabitants as dates and fish; and adverts to the occasional occurrence of fertile spots, the abundance of aromatic and thorny shrubs and fragrant plants, and the violence of the monsoon in the western part of Mekr\u00e1n. He notices also the impossibility of subsisting a large army, and the consequent destruction of the greater part of the men and beasts which accompanied the expedition of Alexander. At the commencement of the 8th century the country was traversed by an army of the K\u00e1liphate.\n\nThe country is inhabited by two distinct races, the Brahu\u00ed and Bal\u00fach. These are each divided into numerous classes; and although Bal\u00fach\u00edst\u00e1n derives its name from the latter, the Brahu\u00eds are considered the dominant people, and from amongst them the rulers of the country are always selected. So marked is the social distinction between these races, that when the Kh\u00e1n assembles his tribes for warlike purposes, the Brahu\u00ed portion demand as a right wheaten flour for their rations, while the Bal\u00fach can only claim a much coarser grain called jo\u00e1r. The period of the arrival of either of the above races in the country is a matter of uncertainty, although many surmises have been offered, but it was probably several centuries ago. One of the numerous traditions most prevalent is, that the last R\u00e1j\u00e1 of the Hindu dynasty, named S\u00edwa, found himself compelled to call in the assistance of the mountain shepherds, to aid in repelling the attacks of certain marauders from the direction of Sind, who, under the leadership of an Afgh\u00e1n chief, threatened to attack the seat of Government. The mountain shepherds, under a chief called Kambar, having successfully performed\nthis service, and finding themselves more powerful than those who called them from their mountains, drove out the Hindu R\u00e1ja, when Kumbar formally assumed the sovereignty of the country. Whether the above story really recounts the origin of the Brahu\u00ed conquest, has yet to be decided; the Kumbar\u00e1n\u00ed tribe, however, takes the precedence amongst all those to be found in the country.\n\nThe date of the arrival of the Bal\u00fach is equally obscure; but it is probably subsequent to that of the Brahu\u00eds. They themselves insist that they are of Arabic origin, and came from Aleppo, under the leadership of one Ch\u00e1kur; after whom some of the most prominent peaks, as well as passes, in the mountains inhabited by the Marr\u00ed and Bh\u00fagti tribes are called, such as Chak\u00edr-ki-Marri and Chak\u00edr-ki-Tung. The above tribes, from their isolated position, and their marauding habits, have preserved their individuality better than have any others in the country. A tribe of Sheiks, called Kaiheri, who are located at the foot of the above mountains, and who claim to have arrived at the same time as the Bal\u00fach from Syria, possess a breed of horses showing unmistakeable signs of Arab blood.\n\nTaking a general view of the original inhabitants of Bal\u00fach\u00edst\u00e1n, we may conclude that they have, from a very early date, been reinforced by emigration from other countries, and from stragglers dropped from the hosts of the numerous conquerors, from Alexander to N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h, who have passed and repassed through Bal\u00fach\u00edst\u00e1n or its neighbourhood, on their way to and from India. Thus we find the S\u00e1k\u00e1 tribe located on the plains of Gressia, on the borders of Mekr\u00e1n, the ancient Gedrosia, and still farther to the west, the Dahu\u00ed. These tribes are on the direct line of Alexander's march; and we know that tribes of this name, from the shores of the Caspian, accompanied his army. In Sar\u00e1w\u00e1n we find the Sarp\u00e1r\u00e1, and Pliny tells us that a tribe called Sarapar\u00e6 resided near the Oxus. Further, on the Dasht-i-Bedaulat, a plain at the northern entrance of the Bolan Pass, we find the Kurds, a name, again, familiar as that of a celebrated and ancient nation. The names of many other tribes might be cited to support this view, but it would require too much space to follow up the subject. Both Brahu\u00eds and Bal\u00fach\u00eds are Muhammadans of the Sunn\u00ed sect.\n\nThe history of the country after the accession of Kumbar, above referred to, is as obscure as during the Hindu dynasty. It would appear, however, that the sceptre was quietly transmitted to Abdulla Kh\u00e1n, the fourth in descent from Kumbar, who, being an intrepid and ambitious soldier, turned his thoughts towards the conquest of Kachl\u00ed Gand\u00e1va, then held by different petty chiefs, under the authority of the Naw\u00e1bs of Sind. After various successes, the Kumbar\u00e1n\u00ed at length possessed themselves of the sovereignty of a considerable portion of that fruitful plain, including the chief town, Gand\u00e1va. It was during this\ncontest that the famous N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h advanced from Persia to the invasion of Hindust\u00e1n; and while at Kandah\u00e1r, he despatched several detachments into Bal\u00fachist\u00e1n, and established his authority in that Province. Abdull\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n, however, was continued in the government of the country by N\u00e1dir\u2019s order; but he was soon after killed in a battle with the forces of the Naw\u00e1bs of Sind. He was succeeded by his eldest son, H\u00e1ji Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, who abandoned himself to the most tyrannical and licentious way of life, and alienated his subjects by oppressive taxation. In these circumstances, Nas\u00edr Kh\u00e1n, the second son of Abdull\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n, who had accompanied the victorious N\u00e1dir to Delhi, and acquired the favour and confidence of that monarch, returned to Khel\u00e1t, and was hailed by the whole population as their deliverer. Finding that expostulation had no effect upon his brother, he one day entered his apartment and stabbed him to the heart. As soon as the tyrant was dead, Nas\u00edr Kh\u00e1n mounted the masnad, amidst the universal joy of his subjects; and immediately transmitted a report of the events which had taken place to N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h, who was then encamped near Kandah\u00e1r. The Sh\u00e1h received the intelligence with satisfaction, and despatched a farm\u00e1n, by return of the messenger, appointing Nas\u00edr Kh\u00e1n beglerbey of all Bal\u00fachist\u00e1n. This event took place in the year 1739.\n\nNas\u00edr Kh\u00e1n proved an active, politic, and warlike prince. He took great pains to re-establish the internal government of all the provinces under his dominion, and improved and fortified the city of Khel\u00e1t. On the death of N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h in 1747, he acknowledged the title of the King of K\u00e1b\u00fal, Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Abd\u00e1li. In 1758, he declared himself entirely independent; upon which Ahmad Sh\u00e1h despatched a force against him, under one of his ministers. The Kh\u00e1n, however, raised an army and totally routed the Afgh\u00e1n general. On receiving intelligence of this discomfiture, the king himself marched with strong reinforcements, and a pitched battle was fought, in which Nas\u00edr Kh\u00e1n was worsted. He retired in good order to Khel\u00e1t, whither he was followed by the victor, who invested the place with his whole army. The Kh\u00e1n made a vigorous defence; and after the royal troops had been foiled in their attempts to take the city by storm or surprise, a negotiation was proposed by the king, which terminated in a treaty of peace. By this treaty it was stipulated that the king was to receive the cousin of Nas\u00edr Kh\u00e1n in marriage; and that the Kh\u00e1n was to pay no tribute, but only, when called upon, to furnish troops to assist the K\u00e1b\u00fal army, for which he was to receive an allowance in cash equal to half their pay. The Kh\u00e1n frequently distinguished himself in the subsequent wars of K\u00e1b\u00fal; and, as a reward for services, the king bestowed upon him several Districts in perpetual and entire sovereignty. Having succeeded in quelling a dangerous rebellion, headed by his cousin Bahr\u00e1m Kh\u00e1n, this able\nprince at length died in extreme old age, in the month of June 1795, leaving three sons and five daughters. He was succeeded by his eldest son M\u00e1hm\u00fad Kh\u00e1n, then a boy of about fourteen years. During the reign of this prince, who has been described as a humane and indolent man, the country was distracted by sanguinary broils. The governors of several Provinces and Districts withdrew their allegiance; and the dominions of the Kh\u00e1ns of Khel\u00e1t gradually diminished, until they comprehended only a small portion of the Provinces formerly subject to Nas\u00edr Kh\u00e1n.\n\nIn 1839, when the British army advanced through the Bolan Pass towards Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n, the conduct of Mehr\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n, the ruler of Bal\u00facist\u00e1n, was considered so treacherous and dangerous as to require 'the exaction of retribution from that chieftain,' and 'the execution of such arrangements as would establish future security in that quarter.' General Willshire was accordingly detached from the army of the Indus with 1050 men, to attack Khel\u00e1t. A gate was knocked in by the field-pieces, and the town and citadel were stormed in a few minutes. Above 400 Bal\u00fac\u00eds were slain, among them Mehr\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n himself; and 2000 prisoners were taken. Subsequent inquiries, however, proved that the treachery towards the British was not on the part of Mehr\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n, but on that of his waz\u00edr, Muhammad Hussain, and certain chiefs with whom he was in league, at whose instigation the British convoys were plundered in their passage through Kachh-Gand\u00e1v\u00e1, and in the Bolan Pass. The treacherous waz\u00edr, however, made our too credulous political officers believe that Mehr\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n was to blame,\u2014his object being to bring his master to ruin, and to obtain for himself all power in the State, knowing that Mehr\u00e1b's successor was a child. How far he succeeded in his object history has shown. In the following year Khel\u00e1t changed hands, the governor established by the British, together with a feeble garrison, being overpowered. At the close of the same year it was reoccupied by the British under General Nott. In 1841, Nas\u00edr Kh\u00e1n, the youthful son of the slain Mehr\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n, was recognised by the British, who soon after evacuated the country.\n\nFrom the conquest of Sind by the British troops, under the command of Sir Charles Napier in 1843, up to the year 1854, no diplomatic intercourse occurred worthy of note between the British and the chief of Bal\u00facist\u00e1n. In the latter year, however, under the Governor-Generalship of the Marquis of Dalhousie, General John Jacob, at that time political superintendent and commandant on the Sind frontier, was deputed to arrange a treaty between the Khel\u00e1t State, then under the chieftainship of M\u00edr Nas\u00edr Kh\u00e1n, and the British Government. This treaty was executed on the 14th of May 1854, and was to the following effect:\n\n'That the former offensive and defensive treaty, concluded in 1841\nby Major Outram, between the British Government and M\u00edr Nas\u00edr Kh\u00e1n, chief of Khel\u00e1t, was annulled.\n\n'That M\u00edr Nas\u00edr Kh\u00e1n, his heirs and successors, bound themselves to oppose to the utmost all the enemies of the British Government, and in all cases to act in subordinate co-operation with that Government, and not to enter into negotiations with other States without its consent.\n\n'That should it be deemed necessary to station British troops in any part of the territory of Khel\u00e1t, they shall occupy such positions as may be thought advisable by the British authorities.\n\n'That the Brahu\u00ed chief was to prevent all plundering on the part of his subjects within, or in the neighbourhood of, British territory.\n\n'That he was further to protect all merchants passing through his territory, and only to exact from them a transit duty, fixed by schedule attached to the treaty; and that, on condition of a faithful performance of these duties, he was to receive from the British Government an annual subsidy of 50,000 rupees (\u00a35000).'\n\nThe provisions of the above treaty were loyally performed by M\u00edr Nas\u00edr Kh\u00e1n up to the time of his death in 1856. He was succeeded by his brother M\u00edr Khud\u00e1d\u00e1d Kh\u00e1n, the present ruler, then a youth of seventeen years of age, who, however, did not obtain his position before he had put down by force a rebellion on the part of his turbulent chiefs, who had first elected him, but, not receiving what they considered an adequate reward from his treasury, sought to depose him in favour of his cousin Sher Dil Kh\u00e1n. In the latter part of 1857, the Indian rebellion being at its height, and the city of Delhi still in the hands of the rebels, a British officer (Major Henry Green) was deputed on the part of the British Government to reside as Political Agent with the Kh\u00e1n at Khel\u00e1t, and to assist him by his advice in maintaining control over his turbulent tribes. This duty was successfully performed until 1863, when, during the temporary absence of Major Malcolm Green, then political agent, Khud\u00e1d\u00e1d Kh\u00e1n was, at the instigation of some of his principal chiefs, attacked, while out riding, by his cousin Sher Dil Kh\u00e1n, and severely wounded. Khud\u00e1d\u00e1d fled for safety to a residence close to the British border, and Sher Dil Kh\u00e1n was elected and proclaimed Kh\u00e1n. His rule was, however, a short one, for early in 1864, when proceeding to Khel\u00e1t, he was murdered in the Gand\u00e1v\u00e1 Pass; and Khud\u00e1d\u00e1d was again elected chief by the very men who had the previous year caused his overthrow, and who had lately been accomplices in the murder of his cousin. Since the above events, Khud\u00e1d\u00e1d has maintained his precarious position with great difficulty. Owing to his inability to govern his unruly subjects without material assistance from the British Government, his country fell into a state of chronic anarchy; and the provisions of the treaty of 1854 having\nbeen broken, diplomatic relations were discontinued with the Khel\u00e1t (or Bal\u00fachist\u00e1n) State at the end of 1874.\n\nBal\u00fachist\u00e1n soon commenced to feel the effects of the withdrawal of the support of the British Government. It sank into such disorder, that the Government of India found itself compelled to interfere. At the desire of the Bal\u00fach ruler and his feudatories, Captain Sandeman, accompanied by a strong escort of cavalry, infantry, and artillery, was sent, in April 1876, to Khel\u00e1t, with a view to settle the disputes between the Kh\u00e1n and his chiefs, and to renew the friendly relations between the British and Bal\u00fach States. In due time he accomplished both objects; and in December 1876, it was arranged that the Kh\u00e1n of Khel\u00e1t, with his principal vassals, should visit the frontier station of Jacob\u00e1b\u00e1d, in order to meet the Viceroy, Lord Lytton. At this interview, the Treaty of 1854, with certain articles added to it, was renewed on the 8th of December 1876 [vide Blue Book, No. 2.\u2014Papers relating to the Treaty with Khel\u00e1t, published 1877, pp. 314-316].\n\nTheir meeting was of the most satisfactory nature. The Kh\u00e1n felt that in future he would receive from the British Government, substantial aid in maintaining the peace of the country. A proposal frequently urged by former political officers, of forming a police for the protection of the traffic through the Bolan Pass, was sanctioned; and at the Kh\u00e1n\u2019s desire it was agreed that a British Agent should again permanently reside at his Court.\n\nSubsequently, the Kh\u00e1n, with his principal chiefs, attended the Grand Darb\u00e1r at Delhi, for the purpose of proclaiming the Queen Empress of India, on the 1st of January 1877.\n\nOn the Kh\u00e1n\u2019s return to Khel\u00e1t, the British Agent received the title of Governor-General\u2019s Agent for Bal\u00fachist\u00e1n, and he was further directed to station a portion of his escort at Quetta. In September 1878, Sher Ali, the Ruler of the neighbouring State of Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n, refused to receive a British envoy, while he admitted one from the Emperor of Russia. In November of the same year, the British Government found it necessary to send an army into Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n in three columns, one by the Khaibar Pass, one by the Kuram valley, and one by the Bolan Pass, via Bal\u00fachist\u00e1n.\n\nAs soon as the Ruler of Bal\u00fachist\u00e1n was made aware of the impending hostilities between the British and the Amir of Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n, he at once placed at our disposal the resources of his country, sending his son and heir-apparent to accompany the General in command of the army passing through his dominions.\n\nThe territories of Bal\u00fachist\u00e1n are now comprised under the following divisions:\u2014Jh\u00e1law\u00e1n, Sar\u00e1w\u00e1n, Khel\u00e1t, Makr\u00e1n, Lus, Kachh-Gand\u00e1v\u00e1, and Kohist\u00e1n.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Much of this country is unexplored; in describing\nit, therefore, only an approximation to accuracy can be attained. It comprises seven Divisions or Provinces, viz. Kachh-Gand\u00e1v\u00e1, and the country of the Marr\u00eds and B\u00fagt\u00eds on the north-east; Sar\u00e1w\u00e1n on the north; Jh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1n on the east; Lus on the south-east; Mekr\u00e1n, occupying an extensive length of country, on the south; Kohist\u00e1n, or the mountain country, on the west; and Khel\u00e1t, in which is situated the capital of Bal\u00fach\u00edst\u00e1n. The most remarkable features of this extensive country are its rugged and elevated surface, its barrenness, and its deficiency of water. The mass of mountains which forms the eastern boundary of that division of Bal\u00fach\u00edst\u00e1n called the mountain territory, lying between the capital, Khel\u00e1t (lat. 29\u00b0 1' 38\" N., long. about 66\u00b0 39' E.), and the plain country to the east of it, designated Kachh\u00ed or Kachh-Gand\u00e1v\u00e1, is composed of several parallel ranges of limestone rock, in close proximity to each other, having a general strike of north-north-east to south-south-west, and a breadth of about 55 miles. This range, a continuation of the Sulaim\u00e1n, originates in Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n, and enters Bal\u00fach\u00edst\u00e1n north of the Bolan Pass in about 30\u00b0 N. lat. and 60\u00b0 30' E. long., under the name of Herbu\u00ed; and after throwing out a branch to the eastward, which touches the river Indus at Sehw\u00e1n, terminates, under the designation of the Khirt\u00e1ri and H\u00e1l\u00e1 mountains, at Cape Monze on the coast, west of Kar\u00e1chi, in about 25\u00b0 N. lat. and 66\u00b0 68' E. long., thus having a total length of upwards of 300 miles. The highest mountain of this range is the Chehil Tan, bearing about north by east 85 miles from Khel\u00e1t, and attaining an altitude of 12,000 feet above the sea. The western range of the Herbu\u00ed mountains in this portion of Bal\u00fach\u00edst\u00e1n is barren and without timber, and scantily peopled with pastoral tribes of Brahuis, who emigrate to the plains of Kachh\u00ed on the approach of the winter months. The direction of the other mountain chains in the heart of the country are almost wholly unknown, with the exception of a few of the principal ranges. One vast chain stretches along the entire coast from the vicinity of R\u00e1s J\u00fani on the west to the river Pur\u00e1l\u00ed on the east. Parallel to this range, and at a distance of about 70 miles north from it, another well-defined chain intersects Makr\u00e1n and joins the Saraw\u00e1n\u00ed mountains near Bela. A third parallel range, called the Wushuti or Mue mountains, about 110 miles farther north from the last-mentioned chain, forms part of the northern boundary of Bal\u00fach\u00edst\u00e1n, separating it from the great southern desert of Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n. The other remarkable chains are the Bashkhird mountains, about 240 miles in length, and the Saraw\u00e1n\u00ed mountains, stretching in a north-east direction.\n\nNorth of the Bolan river and Pass the Herbu\u00ed mountains are met, in about 30\u00b0 N. lat., by confused ranges of rough precipitous mountains, which extend to the eastward with a strike nearly east and west to the Sulaim\u00e1n range, in about 29\u00b0 5' N. lat. and 69\u00b0 30' E. long. This tract\nis almost entirely inhabited by Marr\u00eds, B\u00fagt\u00eds, and other tribes of Bal\u00fach plunderers, and is bounded on the north by the Province of Sewest\u00e1n (Seist\u00e1n). South of these ranges lies the desert country, which touches the Sind frontier in $28^\\circ 27' \\text{ N. lat}$.\n\nThe rivers of Bal\u00fach\u00edst\u00e1n are the Bolan, Rodb\u00e1t, Lora, Shirin\u00e1b, and M\u00fal\u00e1 in the north; the Habb, S\u00edn\u00e1m\u00e1ni, Marwar, N\u00e1ri, Urn\u00e1ch, and Pur\u00e1li in the east; the Sh\u00e1di, Mok\u00fala, Bhas\u00fal, Ghish, and Gashast\u00e1n in the south; and the Dasht, Raksh\u00e1n, Bh\u00e1do, Gwargo, Nihing, and Mashkhid in the west. The two principal water-courses which drain the Kohist\u00e1n portion of Bal\u00fach\u00edst\u00e1n east of Khel\u00e1t are the rivers Bolan and M\u00fal\u00e1, the former rising about 60 miles north-east of Khel\u00e1t, the latter at Anjira (lat. $28^\\circ 19' \\text{ N.}$, long. $66^\\circ 29' \\text{ E.}$), about 45 miles south of that city. They both discharge themselves into the plains of Kacchi, the former at D\u00e1dar, lat. $29^\\circ 28' 51'' \\text{ N.}$, long. $67^\\circ 26' \\text{ E.}$, and the latter at Kotra near Gand\u00e1v\u00e1, lat. $28^\\circ 33' 47'' \\text{ N.}$, long. $67^\\circ 26' \\text{ E.}$. There is at all seasons a plentiful supply of clear running water in these streams, which is entirely used up for irrigation purposes on issuing into the plains. They are subject to dangerous floods from sudden storms in the neighbouring mountains during the rainy season. The two easiest and safest passes from Central Asia into India take their names from these streams. (See Bolan and Mula.) South of the M\u00fal\u00e1, the Gaj river issues into the plains, and its waters are also absorbed in cultivation. The N\u00e1ri issues into the plains near Kajjak, on the north-west of Kachh-Gand\u00e1v\u00e1, in lat. $29^\\circ 36' \\text{ N.}$, and long. $68^\\circ 2' \\text{ E.}$; ordinarily its water is utilized entirely for cultivation in its course through the Province of Sibi; but at periods of heavy rains in the mountains it is liable to burst its banks, and then it inundates immense tracts in the Kachhi desert to the south.\n\nWest of Khel\u00e1t, as far as about $65^\\circ 30' \\text{ E. long.}$, the mountain ranges have much the same strike, and are of the same nature as those to the eastward, but the ranges are much narrower, more defined, and of a lower altitude. The valleys between them vary from 5 to 15 miles in breadth; they are quite devoid of trees. The water-courses generally follow the direction of the hills, from north to south, and in some instances, during heavy rains, their waters reach the Arabian Sea; but as a general rule they are absorbed long before they reach the coast, partly in cultivation, but principally by the sandy arid nature of the soil and excessive dryness of the atmosphere, due probably to the proximity of the great desert on the north-west of Kh\u00e1r\u00e1n, which extends to the confines of Persia. This desert is quite impassable in summer owing to the sand-storms, when the wind is so scorching as utterly to destroy animal life.\n\nClimate, Productions, etc.\u2014The climate of Bal\u00fach\u00edst\u00e1n is extremely various in the different Provinces, and runs to extremes. The cold\nduring winter is exceedingly severe, snow lying on the ground for two months at a time, even in the fertile valleys, while in summer the heat is overpowering on the lower grounds. Some parts of Makr\u00e1n are said to be the hottest localities in Asia. In February and March a good deal of rain falls, after which the dry season commences and lasts till September. The soil in general is exceedingly stony. In the Province of Kachh-Gand\u00e1v\u00e1, however, it is rich and loamy, and so productive, that, it is said, were it all properly cultivated, the crops would be more than sufficient for the supply of the whole of Bal\u00fachist\u00e1n; water, however, is very scarce, except at certain seasons of the year, when the floods descend from the hills. Gold, silver, copper, lead, iron, tin, antimony, brimstone, alum, sal-ammoniac, and many kinds of mineral salts, and saltpetre, are found in various parts of the country. The precious metals have only been discovered in working for iron and lead, in mines near the town of Nal, about 150 miles south-south-west of Khel\u00e1t. The manufactures of Bal\u00fachist\u00e1n are unimportant, being confined to a few matchlocks and other arms at Khel\u00e1t. The gardens and orchards in the vicinity of the towns produce many sorts of fruit, which are sold at a moderate rate, such as apricots, peaches, grapes, almonds, pistachio-nuts, apples, pears, plums, currants, cherries, quinces, figs, pomegranates, mulberries, plantains, melons, guavas, etc. All kinds of grain grown in India are cultivated in the different Provinces of Bal\u00fachist\u00e1n, and there is abundance of vegetables. Madder, oil-seeds, rice, tobacco, cotton, and indigo are also produced; the latter is considered superior to that of Bengal. Great attention is given to the culture of the date fruit in the Province of Makr\u00e1n. On the coast fish are caught in great quantities. The domestic animals of Bal\u00fachist\u00e1n are horses, mules, asses, camels, buffaloes, cattle, sheep, goats, dogs, and cats, besides fowls and pigeons; but there are neither geese, turkeys, nor ducks. The wild animals are tigers, leopards, hyenas, wolves, jackals, tiger-cats, wild dogs, foxes, hares, mongooses, mountain goats, antelopes, m\u00e1rkhor (Capra megaceros), ibex (Capra agagrus), wild sheep or gudd (Ovis cycloceros), wild asses, etc. Of birds there are many European and Central Asian species, and also a few Indian.\n\n**Towns.**\u2014The principal towns in Bal\u00fachist\u00e1n are as follows:\u2014Khel\u00e1t, the capital of the whole country; Mastang, of the Province of Sar\u00e1w\u00e1n; Kozd\u00e1r, of Jh\u00e1law\u00e1n; Bela, of Bela; Kej, of Makr\u00e1n; B\u00e1gh, of Kachh-Gand\u00e1v\u00e1; D\u00e1dar and Gand\u00e1v\u00e1, towns in the last-mentioned Province; Nushki, Sar\u00e1w\u00e1n, Pasni, Der\u00e1, Sonmi\u00e1ni, and Quetta. The inferior towns are Sohr\u00e1b, Sh\u00e1h Godar, Ch\u00e1hgeh, Diz, Tump, S\u00e1mi, Kh\u00e1r\u00e1n, and Zehri-Gat.\n\nKhel\u00e1t forms the subject of a separate article; but as the dimensions of this work involve a considerable interval between the publication of the earlier and later volumes, it may here be convenient to give\na brief description of the town. Khel\u00e1t, the capital of Bal\u00fachist\u00e1n, stands on an elevated site 6783 feet above the sea, on the western side of a well-cultivated plain or valley, about 8 miles long and 2 or 3 broad, a great part of which is laid out in gardens and other enclosures. The town is built in an oblong form, and on three sides is defended by a mud wall, 18 or 20 feet high, flanked at intervals of 250 yards by bastions, which, as well as the wall itself, are pierced with numerous loopholes for matchlock-men. The defence of the fourth side of the city has been formed by cutting away perpendicularly the western face of the hill on which it is partly built. On the summit of this eminence stands the palace, commanding a distinct view of the town and adjacent country. That quarter of the hill on which the Kh\u00e1n's residence is erected has been enclosed by a mud wall, with bastions; the entrance to it is on the south-western side; and here, as well as at the city gates, which are three in number, there is constantly a guard of matchlock-men. Both town and citadel are, however, completely commanded by the surrounding hills, and are incapable of offering any resistance against artillery. Within the walls there are upwards of 2500 houses, and the number of those in the suburbs probably exceeds one-half of that amount. The houses are mostly built of half-burnt brick or wooden frames, plastered over with mud or mortar. In general, the streets are broader than those of native towns, and most of them have a raised pathway on each side for foot-passengers, and also an uncovered kennel in the centre, which is a nuisance, from the quantity of filth thrown into it and the stagnant rain-water that lodges there. The upper storeys of the houses frequently project across the street, and thereby render the part beneath them gloomy and damp. This seems a rude attempt to imitate the b\u00e1z\u00e1rs of Persia and K\u00e1b\u00fal.\n\nThe b\u00e1z\u00e1r of Khel\u00e1t is extensive, well furnished with every kind of goods; all the necessaries of life may be purchased there at a moderate price. The town is supplied with delicious water from a spring in the face of a hill on the opposite side of a plain, whence it meanders nearly through its centre, having the town and suburbs on one side, and on the other the gardens. It may be remarked of this spring that the waters, at their immediate issue from the smaller channels, possess a considerable degree of tepidity until after sunrise, when they suddenly become exceedingly cold, and remain so during the day.\n\nPopulation.\u2014We have no data from which to form an accurate computation of the population of Bal\u00fachist\u00e1n, but it may be estimated at about 400,000. The two great races of Bal\u00fach and Brahui, each sub-divided into an infinite number of tribes, are clearly distinguished from each other by their language and appearance. The Bal\u00fach, or Bal\u00fachki, language partakes considerably of the idiom of the modern Persian, although greatly disguised under a singularly corrupt pronun-\nciation. The Brahu\u00edki, on the other hand, has nothing analogous to Persian, but appears to contain a great number of ancient Hindu words, and, as it strikes the ear, bears a strong resemblance to the dialect spoken in the Punjab. As regards personal appearance, the Bal\u00fach\u00eds in general have tall figures, long visages, and raised features; the Brahu\u00eds, on the contrary, have short, thick bones, with round faces and flat lineaments, with hair and beards frequently brown.\n\nThe Bal\u00fach\u00eds (Bal\u00fach and Brahu\u00ed) are a handsome, active race of men, not possessing great physical strength, but inured to changes of climate and season, and capable of enduring every species of fatigue. In their habits they are pastoral, and much addicted to predatory warfare, in the course of which they do not hesitate to commit every kind of outrage and cruelty. Notwithstanding their predatory habits, however, they are considered to be a hospitable people. After the fashion of other barbarous tribes in that part of the world, they will protect and kindly entertain a stranger while their guest, but feel no scruple in robbing and murdering him as soon as he has left their precincts. They are indolent, and unless excited by amusement or war, or compelled to action by some urgent motive, spend their time in idleness, rude dissipation, and the enjoyment of such coarse luxuries as they can procure\u2014in lounging, gambling, smoking tobacco or hemp, and chewing opium. The tenets of their religion, and still more, perhaps, their poverty, preserve them from the abuse of fermented liquors. Their principal articles of food are milk in all its forms, the flesh of domestic animals, not excepting that of the camel, and game, including wild asses, the flesh of which is considered a delicacy. Their appetites are voracious; they consume incredible quantities of flesh when it can be obtained, and prefer it in a half-cooked state. They also use grain in the form of bread, and prepared in various other ways; but they enjoy most such articles of food or condiment as possess a strong and stimulating flavour, as capsicum, onions, and garlic. Their indolence prompts them to keep as many slaves as they can obtain and support. Polygamy is universal. Some of the lower orders have as many as eight women, either as wives or concubines, and the number is increased in proportion to the rank and means of the man. Wives are obtained by purchase, payment being made in cattle or other articles of pastoral wealth. The ceremony of marriage is performed by the mullah or priest; and on this occasion, as well as on some others affecting females, practices similar to those of the Levitical law are observed. For instance, in this country, as also among the Afgh\u00e1ns, a man is expected to marry the widow of a deceased brother. When a death takes place, the body is watched for three successive nights by assembled friends and neighbours, who\nspend their time in feasting, so that the ceremony seems intended rather to furnish enjoyment to the living, than to render honour to the dead.\n\nThe common dress of the Brahui is a coarse white or blue calico shirt, buttoned round the neck, and reaching below the knee; their trousers are made of the same cloth, or of a kind of striped stuff called sisi, and puckered round the ankles. On their heads they wear a small silk or cotton-quilted cap, fitted to the shape of the skull, and a kammaband or sash, of the same colour, round their waists. The Baluchis wear a similar dress, but a turban on the head, and wide trousers unconfined at the ankle. In winter, the chiefs and their relatives appear in a tunic of chintz, lined and stuffed with cotton; and the poorer classes, when out of doors, wrap themselves up in a sartout made of cloth, manufactured from a mixture of goats' hairs and sheep's wool. The women's dress is very similar to that of the men; their trousers are preposterously wide, and made of silk, or a mixture of silk and cotton.\n\nThe fluctuation of power renders it difficult to define precisely the nature of the government of Khelat. During the reign of Nasir Khan the whole kingdom might be said to have been governed by a complete despotism; yet that ruler so tempered the supreme authority by the privileges granted to the feudal chiefs within their own tribes, that, to a casual observer, it bore the appearance of a military confederation. The tribes all exercise the right of selecting their own sardar, or head. The Khan has the power of confirming or disapproving of their nomination; but this power is never exercised, and appears to be merely nominal. The Khan of Khelat declares war, and makes treaties connected with the whole of Baluchistan, and can order the sardar of each tribe to attend in person with his quota of troops. Agreeably to a code of regulations framed by one of the earliest princes of the Kumbarani dynasty, the entire administration of justice is vested in the person at the head of the government. Each sardar, however, has the power of adjusting petty quarrels, thefts, and disputed points of every description, among the inhabitants of a khel or society; but, in all cases of importance, an appeal lies in the last instance to the Khan at Khelat.\n\nRevenue and Military Resources.\u2014The amount of revenue enjoyed by the Khan of Khelat is inconsiderable, as the ruling races, Baluch and Brahui, pay no direct taxes, and their poverty and simple habits prevent them from contributing much indirectly. His income is therefore derived from his resources as a proprietor of lands or towns; from a proportion of the produce paid in kind by the Afgh\u00e1n, Dehwar, and J\u00e1t cultivators; from dues on local and transit trade; and from arbitrary exactions, a never-failing mode with Eastern potentates of\nrecruiting an exhausted treasury. Pottinger estimated the amount at \u00a335,000; Masson, who had ample means of acquiring information through colloquial channels, at \u00a330,000. At the present date (1882) it is 300,000 rupees, or \u00a330,000, at the utmost. With such a revenue it is obvious that no standing army can be maintained; and Masson, certainly very competent to the task of acquiring information on this subject, states that Mehr\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n, 'nearly destitute of troops in his own pay, was compelled, on the slightest cause for alarm, to appeal to the tribes, who attended or otherwise as suited their whims or convenience.' Pottinger computed the number of available fighting men at 60,000. Mehr\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n could on no occasion assemble more than 12,000, and in his final struggle for power and life, the number of his troops did not amount to 3000. At the present time, about 40,000 would probably be available, if all attended the summons, but the utmost number the Kh\u00e1n could collect would be about 10,000. All depends upon the state of the treasury, the cause of the war, and the power the Kh\u00e1n may be able to exert over his chiefs. The Bal\u00fach soldier is heavily encumbered with arms, carrying a matchlock, a sword, a dagger, and a shield. Pottinger considered them good marksmen, and states that in action they trust principally to their skill in this respect, avoiding close combat; but their readiness in general to close with the British troops, shows that he was in this instance mistaken. There were no Brahu\u00eds opposed to our forces at the battle of Mecanee (Mi\u00e1ni), nor were there any Bal\u00fach\u00eds from Bal\u00fachist\u00e1n. The levies of the Am\u00edr of Sind were principally composed of Sind\u00ed and Bal\u00fach tribes, who had long been settled in Sind. The greater part serve on foot; but a not inconsiderable number have horses. Camels are only used by tribes on the western borders of Bal\u00fachist\u00e1n in their predatory excursions.\n\nB\u00e1manbor.\u2014Petty State in North K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency, consisting of 4 villages, with one independent tribute-payer. Lat. 22\u00b0 24' N., long. 71\u00b0 6' E. Estimated revenue in 1876, \u00a3210; a tribute of \u00a37, 12s. is paid to the British Government. Chief village, B\u00e1manbor.\n\nB\u00e1mangh\u00e1t\u00ed.\u2014The northern Division of Morbhanj, one of the Orissa Tributary States under the jurisdiction of the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, comprising 702 villages, 23,861 houses, and a population in 1881 of 129,368 persons, of whom 32,951 were Hindus, 2862 Muhammadans, 61 Christians, and 93,494 aboriginal tribes, chiefly Sant\u00e1ls and Kols. B\u00e1mangh\u00e1t\u00ed was for many years under direct British management, the supervising officer being the Deputy-Commissioner of Singbh\u00fam. This was necessitated by a peasant rebellion, brought on by the oppression of the aborigines at the hands of the Hindu land-stewards and petty officials of the R\u00e1j\u00e1. In 1878, it was restored to the chief; but on his death in 1882, it again passed\nunder British management with the remainder of the State, during the minority of the new chief, a child.\n\n**B\u00e1mani.**\u2014Mountain peak near R\u00e1yab\u00edgi, in the Jaipur (Jeypore) Estate, Vizagapatam District, Madras Presidency; height, 2488 feet. Lat. 19\u00b0 35' N., long. 83\u00b0 40' E.\n\n**Bamauri.**\u2014Village in Kumaun District, North-Western Provinces, situated in lat. 29\u00b0 13' N., and long. 79\u00b0 35' E.; on the route from Bareilly (Barcli) to Almora, 42 miles south of the latter; elevation above the sea, 1700 feet.\n\n**Bamhang\u00e1on.**\u2014Zamin\u00e1d\u00e1r\u00ed or estate in Burh\u00e1 tahsil, B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t District, Central Provinces; area, 8 square miles; 5 villages; occupied houses, 378. Population (1881) 1728, namely, males, 870, and females, 858.\n\n**Bamn\u00ed.**\u2014Town in Mandl\u00e1 tahsil, Mandl\u00e1 District, Central Provinces. Population (1881) 2400, namely, Hindus, 1560; Kab\u00edrpanth\u00eds, 551; Muhammadans, 125; Christians, 14; aboriginal tribes, 150.\n\n**Bamni\u00e1w\u00e1s.**\u2014Town in Jaipur (Jeypore), native State of R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Population (1881) 6125.\n\n**Bamon\u00ed.**\u2014Town in Rangpur District, Bengal. Population (1881) 6895, namely, Hindus, 5146, and Muhammadans, 1749; area, 4839 acres.\n\n**B\u00e1mr\u00e1.**\u2014Native State attached to Sambalpur District, Central Provinces, lying between 21\u00b0 8' 30\" and 22\u00b0 11' 30\" N. lat., and between 84\u00b0 10' 15\" and 85\u00b0 15' 30\" E. long. On the north it runs up into a point between the Bon\u00e1i and G\u00e1ngpur States; on the south it is bounded by the State of Rair\u00e1khol; on the east by T\u00e1lcher and Pal Laher\u00e1 in Orissa; and on the west by Sambalpur; extreme length from north to south, about 75 miles; extreme breadth, about 64; area, 1988 square miles; population (1881) 81,286.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014To the south, B\u00e1mr\u00e1 is broken up by hills and covered with jungle, but the regions in the north-west and centre are particularly fertile. The soil is light and sandy, becoming more loamy in the neighbourhood of the hills. The only river of importance is the Br\u00e1hman\u00ed, which flows through the eastern part of the State from north to south; and but for one or two rocky obstructions, timber might be floated down this river to the sea-coast of Orissa. The magnificent s\u00e1l forests are comparatively valueless, for want of means to get the timber to a market. Iron ore is found in abundance, and the jungles produce a considerable quantity of lac, silk, cocoons, bees-wax, and honey. Resin is also extracted from the s\u00e1l tree.\n\n**History.**\u2014B\u00e1mr\u00e1 was formerly subject to Sarg\u00faja, but was added to the Garhj\u00e1t cluster of States in the 15th century by Balr\u00e1n Deva, the first R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sambalpur. The ruling family claim to be Gang\u00e1-bansi R\u00e1jputs. Their traditions, however, do not extend beyond the middle of the 16th century, when it is said that R\u00e1m Chandra Deva was R\u00e1j\u00e1.\nFrom him ten successions are deduced to the present chief, Sudhat Deva, who is now (1883) thirty-four years of age, and has a son.\n\n**Population.**\u2014The Census of 1872 returned the population of the State at 53,613, which in 1881 had increased to 81,286, or by 51\u00b761 per cent. over the same area (1988 square miles in both years). This increase, however, is more apparent than real, being due to a great extent to imperfect enumeration in 1872. The male population in 1881 numbered 41,761, and the female 39,525. Number of villages, 632; number of houses, 14,828; average persons per square mile, 40\u00b79; houses per square mile, 7\u00b746; inmates per house, 5\u00b748. Population classified according to sex\u2014males, 41,761; females, 39,525; according to age, the male children under 14 years numbered 3024; the female children under 14 years, 2410. Hindus numbered 50,592; Muhammadans, 68; aboriginal tribes, 30,626. The most numerous of the aborigines are the Kols, the Gonds, the Kandhs, and the Bhuiy\u00e1s.\n\n**Division into Town and Country.**\u2014In 1881, only 1 town exceeded a population of 1000, and 14 numbered from 500 to 1000 inhabitants; townships from 200 to 500 inhabitants, 111; villages of less than 200 inhabitants, 506. Of the total area of 1988 square miles, only 600 are under cultivation, and of the portion lying waste, 580 are returned as cultivable. The one important crop is rice; but pulses, oil-seeds, sugar-cane, and cotton are also cultivated. Of the jungle produce, lac deserves mention. The internal trade of B\u00e1mr\u00e1 has been little developed. Besides agriculture, the only industry of importance is weaving. Of artisans, blacksmiths form the most numerous class. Commercial progress, however, cannot be expected until the country is opened up by means of communication. An old road to Calcutta, now fallen into disuse, runs through from west to east. With this exception, there is not a single made road in the State. Nor are there greater facilities for water traffic. It would be possible to float timber down the Br\u00e1hman\u00ed (the only important river in the State) to the coast, and so to turn to account the magnificent s\u00e1l forests of B\u00e1mr\u00e1, but for certain rocky obstructions, which render navigation impossible at certain parts of its course. With improved means of transit, the wealth of B\u00e1mr\u00e1 in timber and in iron ore may some day become available. B\u00e1mr\u00e1 pays a tribute of \u00a335, out of an estimated gross revenue of \u00a31600; no military force is maintained. Education is still very backward, and what exists has been created by the efforts of the last few years.\n\n**Bams\u00e1ru.**\u2014Pass in Garhw\u00e1l State, North-Western Provinces, over the Jamnotri range, which separates the valleys of the Ganges and the Jumna (Jamun\u00e1). Lat. 30\u00b0 56' N., long. 78\u00b0 36' E.; elevation above the sea, 15,447 feet; summit reaches the limit of perpetual snow.\nBanaganapalli.\u2014Estate in Karn\u00fal (Kurnool) District, Madras Presidency. Lat. $15^\\circ 2' 30''$ to $15^\\circ 28' 50''$ N., long. $78^\\circ 1' 45''$ to $78^\\circ 25' 30''$ E.; present area, 255 square miles, though formerly nearly 500; population (1881) 30,745, being 5952 Muhammadans (chiefly Sunnis) and 24,793 Hindus, of whom more than half belong to the cultivating and shepherd castes. Bounded by the Koilk\u00e1ntla, Nandi\u00e1l, and Pattikonda taluks; the estate comprises the western half of the basin of the Kunder, and is also watered by the Jareru river. It contains 64 towns and villages, of which Banaganapalli, the capital, has a population of 2822, and nine others over 1000. Of the whole area, only 62 square miles (39,413 acres) are waste, the rest of the estate being under cereals, cotton (of which the cultivation is annually increasing), and indigo. There are no forests, and the waste lands supply pasturage. The trade consists almost entirely of the interchange of local produce, but at the markets, cotton and silk cloths, chintz, and lacquered wares\u2014products of local industry\u2014are sometimes collected for exportation. Eighty years ago, copper mines were worked, and near Banaganapalli there are diamond pits, yielding annually stones to the value of a few pounds. The estate has no railway or first-class road; the few schools are of the most primitive type, and endowed charities do not exist. The annual revenue amounts nominally to \u00a322,464; but of this sum two-thirds are drawn by 18 minor jagird\u00e1rs, relatives of the Naw\u00e1b, and the remainder, after deducting \u00a35341 for expenses of the palace and administration, does not suffice to meet the interest accruing on the debts inherited from his father by the present chief. Owing to the unruly character of the leading jagird\u00e1rs, the Naw\u00e1b is unable to restore his finances by increased taxation. More than half of the whole estate has passed from his hands to other members of his family; but out of the 18 alienations thus existing, 9 might be resumed, if the Naw\u00e1b exercised his privilege of refusing the right of adoption to the females at present holding the estates. Of the others, 4 are held by courtiers of the Niz\u00e1m, who consider themselves so far independent, that they refuse to pay the road cess, and resent any interference in their affairs. The land revenue is farmed, the villages being assigned by auction to the highest bidder, and the farmer sub-lets the lands to the cultivators. The tenant therefore holds at will only, and is liable at all times to enhancement of rent, without the option of relinquishing his holding. Historically, the estate has but little interest. It was granted in the 17th century by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb to Muhammad Beg Kh\u00e1n, eldest son of his Waz\u00edr, in whose family it remained for three generations. The chief dying without male heirs, the estate was given by the Niz\u00e1m (1764) to the ancestor of the present owner. In 1800, the suzerainty was transferred by the Niz\u00e1m to the British Government; and, in consequence\nof local disorder, the estate was administered by the Collector of Cuddapah from 1825 to 1848. In the latter year it was restored, the Governor of Madras renewing the previous grants, and conferring larger civil and criminal powers upon the chief, who now holds the title of Naw\u00e1b, bestowed upon him in 1876, on the occasion of the visit of the Prince of Wales to the Madras Presidency. The rule of primogeniture is followed, and in the absence of male issue the nearest relation succeeds. Transit duties are not levied in the State.\n\n**Banaganapalli.**\u2014Chief town in the Banaganapalli estate, Karn\u00fal (Kurnool) District, Madras Presidency; situated 250 miles from Madras, and 90 from Bellary. Lat. 15\u00b0 15' N., long. 78\u00b0 20' E.; population (1881) 2822. As the head-quarters of the estate, the Naw\u00e1b's courts, jail, and treasury are situated here. The town lies in a plain near the mouth of a gorge, a stream from the hills flowing through its streets. About half a mile distant are the diamond mines, situated in a deposit of breccia underlying compact limestone. They would seem to be nearly worked out, for though in the 18th century they yielded large returns, the best stones found between 1800-1850 were valued at \u00a330, and even these were only exceptional. Since 1850, the diamond washers have fallen off greatly in number, and those who continue at the mines procure only a bare subsistence.\n\n**Ban\u00e1s ('Hope of the Forest').**\u2014A river of R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Rises in the Ar\u00e1valli range (lat. 25\u00b0 7' N., long. 73\u00b0 35' E.) in Udaipur (Oodeypore), about 3 miles from the old fortress of K\u00famalgarh; flows south until it meets the Gogunda plateau, when it turns eastward, and cutting through the outlying ridges of the Ar\u00e1valli Hills, bursts into the open country. Here on its banks is situated the Vaishnava shrine of Irathdev\u00e1ra; farther on it flows north-east, across Mew\u00e1r (the middle country) proper, collecting the greater part of the drainage of the Udaipur (Oodeypore) valley and the waters flowing from the south-east slopes and hill tracts of the Ar\u00e1vallis. It joins the Ch\u00e1mbal (lat. 25\u00b0 54' N., long. 76\u00b0 50' E.) a little beyond the north-east extremity of Bundi (Boondee) State, after a course of about 300 miles. Chief affluents in Mew\u00e1r\u2014the Ber\u00e1ch and the Kothesri from the Ar\u00e1vallis, and the Dh\u00fand from the Jaipur (Jeypore) country. Where the Ban\u00e1s strikes through a small picturesque group of hills at R\u00e1jmah\u00e1l, there is some fine scenery, and here its waters are very clear and pure; but though the bed in the upper part of its course is hard and rocky, it abounds in dangerous quicksands lower down. The R\u00e1jput\u00e1na-M\u00e1lwa State Railway crosses it at Ham\u00edrgarh in Mew\u00e1r.\n\n**Ban\u00e1s.**\u2014River of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bengal. At first it is merely a spill channel from the Son, which it leaves near Belt\u00e1 village; as it proceeds northwards, it becomes the drainage channel between the Arrah Canal and the Bihiy\u00e1 branch of the Son Canal system. After\npassing under the railway between Arrah and Bihiy\u00e1, it turns to the east, and finally falls into the Gang\u00ed n\u00e1di. It contains very little water, except during the rains.\n\n**Ban\u00e1s.**\u2014River of Chutia Nagpur, Bengal. Rises in the range of hills which separates Ch\u00e1ng Bhak\u00e1r from Kore\u00e1 State; flows in a westerly direction through Ch\u00e1ng Bhak\u00e1r until it takes a bend to the north, following the boundary line of the State, which it leaves at its north-west corner, and passes into Rew\u00e1. It is a hill stream, with rocky bed and frequent rapids; there is no traffic.\n\n**Ban\u00e1sa.**\u2014Village in Garhw\u00e1l State, North-Western Provinces; situated on the left bank of the Jumna (Jamun\u00e1), 7 miles below its source, at the confluence of the Ban\u00e1sa torrent. Lat. 30\u00b0 56' N., long. 78\u00b0 27' E. Picturesquely perched on a natural ledge of rock, with other ledges rising above. Hot springs abound in the neighbourhood. Overwhelmed and half destroyed by the fall of a precipice in 1816.\n\n**Ban\u00e1var** ('Arrow-bearing?').\u2014T\u00e1luk in Kad\u00far District, Mysore Native State; enlarged in 1875 by the addition of Kad\u00far t\u00e1luk, and now contains 6 Hoblis, with 440 primary and 171 secondary villages. Area, 467 square miles; population (1881) 76,384; land revenue (1874-75), exclusive of water rates, \u00a311,507, or 5s. per cultivated acre. Hindus form the bulk of the population, of whom 36 per cent. are agriculturists.\n\n**Ban\u00e1var.**\u2014Village in Kad\u00far District, Mysore Native State; 30 miles east of Chikmagal\u00far. Lat. 13\u00b0 24' N., long. 76\u00b0 14' E.; population (1881) 2110; municipal revenue (1874-75) \u00a364; rate of taxation, 7d. per head. Formerly the capital of a Jain principality, and now the head-quarters of a t\u00e1luk of the same name.\n\n**Banav\u00e1si** (Bannavasi).\u2014Town in North K\u00e1nara District, Bombay Presidency; situated on the banks of the Warda river, 14 miles from Sirsi, the head-quarters of the Sub-division, 20 miles south-east of Sunda, and 370 north-west of Madras. Lat. 14\u00b0 33' N., long. 75\u00b0 5' E. Population (1881) 1999. Formerly a town of considerable importance, but now hardly more than a village. The temple to Siva, though a mean building, had once very large endowments, and is still much frequented; it contains a very fine figure of Nandi, and a table made from black granite. The car-drawing ceremony here takes place every year about March or April, and is attended by about 4000 people, chiefly Haiga Br\u00e1hmans. The name of the town occurs in Ptolemy.\n\n**Bankura.**\u2014District and town in Bardw\u00e1n Division, Bengal.\u2014See Bankura.\n\n**B\u00e1nda.**\u2014District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the North-Western Provinces, lying between 24\u00b0 53' 15\" and 25\u00b0 55' N. lat., and between 80\u00b0 2' 45\" and 81\u00b0 36' 15\" E. long. Area, 3061 square miles; with a population, in 1881, of 698,608 souls. B\u00e1nda is a\nDistrict of the Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d Division, and is bounded on the north-east and north by the river Jumna (Jam\u00fan\u00e1); on the west by the river Ken, the District of Ham\u00edrpur, and the Native State of Gaurih\u00e1r; on the south and south-east by the Native States of Panna, Charkh\u00e1ri, and Rew\u00e1; and on the east by Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d District. Its southern boundary is intersected by outlying portions of the surrounding Native States. The administrative head-quarters are at the town of B\u00e1n\u00e1da, which is also the largest town in the District.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District of B\u00e1n\u00e1da consists of a finely varied country, sloping downwards from the Vindhyan range on the south-east to the valley of the Jumna and the Ken on the north and west. The southern or highest portion is composed of the gneiss hills which form the northward escarpment of the great Central Indian table-land. These hills are well wooded, and abound in massive boulders, gigantic scars, and deep ravines; their highest points being about 1300 feet above the sea. Their sides are scored by the excavated beds of large mountain torrents, which in the rainy months form the affluents of the Jumna, and in the dry season gradually diminish, until by the month of May their channels are mostly empty. The Ken and the B\u00e1gain, however, the most important amongst them, are never quite dry. To the north of this hilly region lies a tract of undulating plains, at first thickly sprinkled with granite boulders, similar to those on the hills, but gradually diminishing in size and numbers as we descend towards the valley of the Jumna. Isolated pyramidal heights, rising like rocky islands from the general level, are found in the portion of this region nearest to the Vindhyan range, and are often crowned by the ruined fortresses of the Chandel or Bundela chieftains. The plain itself, the most fertile portion of the District, is widest at its western extremity, near the town of B\u00e1n\u00e1da, and narrows like a wedge as it runs eastward, till it finally disappears at the base of the Vindhyan hills. The Jumna valley rises by a series of terraces, broken with ravines, to the level of the table-land above. A portion of the low-lying plain is marshy, and there are patches of scrub jungle in the neighbourhood of the Jumna. The soil of the low ground is chiefly the black variety, known as m\u00f3r, which has a singular power of retaining moisture, and is very fertile. As the tributary rivers are confined within wide and deep-cut channels, they are not liable to overflow their banks; but the Jumna inundates and fertilizes its own immediate valley. The whole District is moderately well wooded. The forests in the south-east of the District were, after a few years' negotiations with the proprietors, constituted a Forest division in 1881. They comprise an area of 74,743 acres, of which 53,535 acres have been acquired as Government property, while 21,208 acres are managed under an agreement by which Government gets 55 per cent. of the profits, and the old proprietors 45 per cent. Iron is found along\nthe base of the Vindhyan hills, and is worked at Kaly\u00e1npur, south of M\u00e1nikpur. Sandstone for building purposes is extensively quarried at several places, as also are limestone and kankar. Antelopes, wild pig, nilgai, and ravine deer are plentiful; hyenas common; tigers rare. The rocky hills scattered over the District form a favourite resort of leopards. Snakes are numerous, deaths of human beings and of cattle from their bites being of common occurrence.\n\nHistory.\u2014B\u00e1nda forms one of the Districts included under the general name of Bundelkhand, and its early history is identical with that of the Province, of which a brief sketch may here be given. Bundelkhand is said to have been originally inhabited by the Gonds, a tribe of non-Aryan aborigines; but concerning the date or circumstances of the Aryan conquest nothing is accurately known. It fills a considerable place, however, in the mythical history of the heroic age; the name of B\u00e1nda itself being derived, according to legend, from the sage B\u00e1md\u00e9o, a contemporary of the mighty R\u00e1ma Chandra. Many local names in the District are in like manner connected with his companions. The earliest kings whose dynasty has come down to us through coins and inscriptions were the N\u00e1gas. Their capital was at Narw\u00e1r, and they ruled, probably as viceroys to the Guptas of Kanauj, from the commencement of our era till the end of the 2nd century. From that period till the 8th century, little can be ascertained with regard to the political state of Bundelkhand; but it was apparently independent of the Kanauj government, and formed part of the kingdom of Gwalior. From the 9th to the 14th century, the tract was ruled by the Chandel dynasty (with the exception of a temporary occupation by Prithwi R\u00e1j\u00e1, the Chauh\u00e1n King of Delhi, who defeated the Chandel monarch in 1183 A.D.), under whom it rose to the highest power and eminence. Their epoch forms the Augustan age of Bundelkhand, and to it all the principal architectural remains in the tract are referred. It was the Chandels who built the strong mountain fortresses of K\u00e1l\u00ednjar and Ajaigarh, the exquisite temples of Khajur\u00e1hu and Mahoba, and the noble artificial lakes of Ham\u00edrpur. Though often attacked by the Musalm\u00e1ns (e.g., by Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed (Ghuznee) in 1023, and more successfully by Kutab-ud-d\u00edn in 1196), they maintained their independence until near the beginning of the 14th century.\n\nThe Chandel monarchy was dissolved about the year 1300, and this part of its dominions was occupied by the Bundelas, a body of Hindu military adventurers, from whom the tract derives its modern name, and whose present rank shows them to have been impure or spurious R\u00e1jputs. These hardy southern immigrants infused fresh blood into a country long weakened by the Muhammadan invasions. Owing to their determined opposition, the aggressive Musalm\u00e1ns did not succeed in subjugating Bundelkhand before the reign of Akbar; and even under\nthat Emperor their authority seems to have been little more than nominal. During the whole period of the Mughal dynasty, the Bundela chiefs remained uncertain and rebellious vassals to the court of Delhi. They were always ready to seize upon the family dissensions, so frequent in the house of Akbar, as an opportunity for asserting their independence. Under Champat R\u00e1\u00ed they long resisted the power of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, and after his death they rallied round his son, their national hero, Chhatar S\u00e1l, who set himself up as the head of a Hindu league, to oppose the proselytizing efforts of Aurangzeb, and never rested until he had made himself practically independent of Delhi. He attained this object, however, through the dangerous aid of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, to whom, on his death, about 1734, he left one-third of his territories, including the present Districts of L\u00e1litpur, Jalau, and Jh\u00e1nsi. In 1738, B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o, the second of the Peshwas, obtained the supremacy of all Bundelkhand, by treaty with the R\u00e1j\u00e1s. From that time until 1803, the country remained more or less in the power of the Poona throne, though perpetually disturbed by intestine quarrels and predatory border warfare.\n\nThe intervening sixty-five years formed a period of great misery and confusion for Bundelkhand, as for the rest of Upper India. Military hordes collected; the hill fastnesses were occupied by the forts of robber chiefs; the villages were plundered and devastated; the commercial and agricultural prosperity, which had grown under the fostering care of the Chandel and earlier Bundela princes, was utterly crushed and desolated by war in the time of the later Bundela kings. Added to all this misery, the mode of collecting the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 revenue was so oppressive that nothing remained to the cultivator beyond the bare means of subsistence. This was the condition of affairs when the British occupation took place. After the battle of Poona in 1802, the treaty of Bassein was concluded with the Peshwa, by which he agreed to cede certain territories for the maintenance of a British force. These territories were afterwards exchanged, by a supplementary treaty in December 1803, for part of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 dominions in Bundelkhand. An arrangement was also entered into with R\u00e1j\u00e1 Himmat Bah\u00e1dur, a military adventurer, who held a large part of Bundelkhand under the Peshwa, by which an extension of territory was granted to him as the price of his adherence, and for the maintenance of troops under his command in the service of the British Government. Much opposition was offered by Shamsher Bah\u00e1dur, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Naw\u00e1b of B\u00e1nda, as well as by the freebooting chiefs, each of whom had to be separately dislodged. But by the close of the year 1804, the country had been sufficiently pacified to permit of its constitution into a British District. Of this District, B\u00e1nda formed a part until the year 1819, when it was separated under the name of Southern Bundelkhand. The assignments\ngranted to R\u00e1j\u00e1 Himmat Bah\u00e1dur had been resumed shortly after his death in 1804. The titular rank of Naw\u00e1b, with a pension of 4 l\u00f3khs of rupees, was retained in the family of Shamsher Bah\u00e1dur.\n\nUnder British rule, B\u00e1n\u00e1da remained free for fifty years from those greater misfortunes which make up the incidents of Indian history; but its economical condition was far from happy. The impoverishment which it had undergone during the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rule left it in a miserable state. The people were hopelessly in debt; the land was exhausted by incessant cropping; the wells and other means of irrigation had fallen out of repair, and there was no capital in the District for their renewal. The British fiscal system, though not so oppressive as that of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, was severe enough to stand in the way of improvements. In short, the District required, but did not obtain, a long period of light taxation.\n\nOn the outbreak of the Mutiny in May 1857, the miserable and ignorant inhabitants were easily incited to revolt by the Cawnpur and Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d mutineers. The 1st Native Infantry seized on the magazine and public buildings at B\u00e1n\u00e1da, and were joined by the troops of the Naw\u00e1b. Until the 14th of June every effort was made by the British residents to retain the town, but on that date it was abandoned. The Naw\u00e1b of B\u00e1n\u00e1da then set himself at the head of the rebellious movement. The Joint Magistrate of Kar\u00far was murdered at the gate of the Naw\u00e1b's palace at B\u00e1n\u00e1da on the 15th of June. The people through the country districts rose en masse, and a period of absolute anarchy followed. The Naw\u00e1b attempted to organize a feeble government, but his claims were disputed by other pretenders, and he was quite unable to hold in check the mob of savage plunderers whom the Mutiny had let loose upon the District. The fort of K\u00e1l\u00ednjar, however, was held throughout by the British forces, aided by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Pann\u00e1. The town of Band\u00e1 was recovered by General Whitlock on the 20th of April 1858. The Naw\u00e1b was afterwards permitted to retire with a pension of \u00a33600 a year. Since the Mutiny, the fiscal system has been remodelled, and it is hoped that the new settlement will conduce to the revival of prosperity in B\u00e1n\u00e1da, where the general poverty and apathy still bear witness to the disastrous period of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 misrule.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1853 returned the total population of B\u00e1n\u00e1da at 743,872 souls. In 1865 it had decreased to 724,372, showing a falling off of 19,500, or 2'62 per cent. In 1872 the population had further decreased to 697,684, showing an additional falling off of 26,761, or 3'3 per cent. The decrease may be accounted for partly by the Mutiny, but more especially by the poverty of Bundelkhand, which leads the inhabitants to migrate on the slightest pressure of famine or scarcity. A slight falling off is attributed to the departure of the Naw\u00e1b of B\u00e1n\u00e1da and other leading families, who\nsupported large bodies of dependants. The Census of 1881 showed a very slight increase of 924, the total population being returned at 698,608 on an area of 3061 square miles. Density of population 221.6 per square mile. Number of villages, 1166, or .38 per square mile. Number of occupied houses, 123,393, with an average of 5.66 inmates each. Divided according to sex, the males numbered 354,377, and the females, 344,231. Classified according to religion, Hindus numbered 657,413, or 94.10 per cent.; Muhammadans, 40,627, or 5.81 per cent.; Sikhs, 21; Christians, 278; Jains, 269. The Br\u00e1hmans form a very numerous body, and, together with the R\u00e1jputs, comprise the mass of the cultivators, the former numbering 106,099, and the latter 58,381. Next come the trading castes of Baniy\u00e1s, 23,071, and Ahirs, 55,545. The labouring class consists of low-caste Hindus and semi-Hinduized aborigines. The most numerous of these are the Cham\u00e1rs, 109,363. Though the Bundelas give their name to the Province, they are not numerous in B\u00e1n\u00e1da. There are only 3 towns containing more than 5000 inhabitants\u2014B\u00e1n\u00e1da, the chief town and civil station, 28,974; R\u00e1j\u00e1pur, 7329; and Mataundh, 6258. Karwi, which in 1872 contained a population of 6854, has greatly decayed of late years, and the Census returns of 1881 do not give it as among the towns containing 5000 inhabitants or upwards. The District also contains the famous hill fortress of K\u00e1l\u00ednjar, the stronghold of the Chandel kings. The towns and villages in 1881 were classified as follows:\u2014Of the 1166 villages and towns, 326 contained under 200 inhabitants; 391 from 200 to 500; 258 from 500 to 1000; 146 from 1000 to 2000; 32 from 2000 to 3000; 10 from 3000 to 5000; 2 from 5000 to 10,000; and 1 upwards of 20,000. As regards occupation, the male population were returned under the following six main headings in the Census of 1881:\u2014Class (1) Professional, including military and civil officers of Government, the learned professions, etc., 7212; (2) domestic servants, board and lodging-house keepers, etc., 1118; (3) commercial class, including merchants, traders, carriers, 4685; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 175,768; (5) manufacturing, industrial, and artisan class, 38,127; (6) indefinite and non-productive (including 17,493 general labourers and 109,974 children, old men, and persons of unspecified occupation), 127,467. The language in ordinary use is Bundelkhandi, a corrupt form of Hind\u00ed; but another dialect, embracing a debased Urd\u00fa element, is spoken in many villages.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Though B\u00e1n\u00e1da is not quite so backward as some other portions of Bundelkhand, yet its condition is far from satisfactory. Out of an assessed area, in 1880-81, of 1,832,320 acres, 936,960 are cultivated, while 644,480 more are cultivable or grazing lands. The principal produce consists of wheat, gram, jo\u00e1r, b\u00e1jr\u00e1, cotton, til,\narhar, alsi, and masuri. The crops of the District are of two classes\u2014the autumn or kharif harvest, for which the sowing takes place from June to August, and the spring or rabi harvest, sown in November or December. Of the former, the principal crop in value, though not in acreage, is cotton, occupying an area in 1880-81 of 152,095, and in 1881-82 of 201,866 acres. Hemp and millet are generally sown with it. The other principal kharif crops in 1881-82 were\u2014jo\u00e1r, 122,086 acres; b\u00e1jr\u00e1, 18,131 acres; jo\u00e1r and b\u00e1jr\u00e1 together, 159,206 acres; b\u00e1jr\u00e1 and arhar, 27,228 acres. Rice occupies only 8227 acres. The chief spring crops are wheat and gram, which are frequently sown together, and occupied the following areas in 1881-82\u2014wheat, sown alone, 7957 acres; wheat and gram together, 160,351 acres; gram, sown alone, 183,750 acres. Oil-seeds are also largely grown. The opium poppy is cultivated on 1018 acres. The mahu\u00e1 tree grows in great luxuriance throughout the District; it is extremely useful for its flowers, fruit, and wood, as well as for the oil extracted from the kernels of the fruit. The chief timber trees are tendu (Diospyros melanoxylon), the heart-wood of which is ebony; kem (Nauclea); haldu (Nauclea cordifolia); kh\u00e1wa (Pentaptera arjuna); akol (Allangium hexapetalum); and gantha (Schrebera sureitenoides), a very hard rough timber. Teak of a small size is found in both the hills and plains. Considerable quantities of bamboos are exported. The District has suffered much from the spread of the destructive k\u00fans grass, which has totally impoverished many villages. The peasantry are deeply in debt, poorly housed, and totally apathetic; the landowners are in very straitened circumstances. The system of cultivation is simple, and in the uplands few spots can be tilled to advantage for more than three years consecutively. Rotation of crops is general. Manure is little used, and irrigation is as yet performed only by labourers and bullocks. A scheme, however, has been projected, but is yet (1883) in abeyance, for irrigating the country between the Ken and the B\u00e1gain, by means of canals drawn from the former river, which would supply water to about 60,000 acres. The average out-turn and value of crops is as follows:\u2014Wheat, 6 cwt. 22 lbs. per acre, worth \u00a31, 2s.; maize, 5 cwts. 18 lbs. per acre, worth \u00a31; and cotton, 2 cwts. per acre, worth \u00a31, 15s. 10d. The tenures of land are numerous and complicated, but most of them proceed on a plan of joint proprietorship, the coparceners cultivating each his separate share, and the revenue being assessed among them by a rate. As the land has to lie fallow for periods of varying duration, the right of occupancy extends rather to similar holdings than to actual plots. The system of separate large ownerships is on the increase. The total number of adult male cultivators, excluding labourers, is returned at 132,710, cultivating an average of 5\u00b777 acres each. The total population, however, dependent on the\nsoil, amounts to 493,652, or 77.66 per cent. of the District population. Of the total District area of 3061 square miles, 2871 square miles are assessed for Government revenue, of which 1543 were actually under cultivation in 1880\u201381, while 990 square miles were returned as cultivable. Total Government assessment, including rates and cesses paid on land, \u00a3137,052, or an average of 2s. 9\u00bdd. per cultivated acre; total rental paid by cultivators, including cesses, \u00a3207,699, or an average of 4s. 1\u00bcd. per cultivated acre. The rates of rent vary from under 4s. an acre for ordinary and poor soils, to 15s. an acre for the best.\n\nLabourers engaged by the year receive as wages 16s. per annum, eked out by an allowance of grain from June to October, and a present of clothing at the end of the engagement. Monthly labourers, during the busy season, obtain 4s. a month, besides a daily allowance of \u00bd lb. of bread. Ordinary day-labourers sometimes receive as little as one anna (1\u00bdd.) per diem, without further allowance. Women and children take part in even the most arduous field work. Wages have been on the increase since 1850, but as the price of grain has risen in more than the same proportion, the benefit to the labourer is only apparent.\n\nCoolies received from 1\u00bed. to 2\u00bcd. a day in 1850; from 3d. to 3\u00bed. in 1881: smiths, from 3d. to 4\u00bdd. in 1850; from 4\u00bdd. to 7\u00bdd. in 1871: bricklayers, from 3\u00bed. to 6d. in 1850; from 4\u00bdd. to 7\u00bdd. in 1881: and carpenters, from 3d. to 6d. at the former date; from 4\u00bdd. to 7\u00bdd. at the latter. At the same time, prices ruled as follows:\u2014Common rice, in 1850, 4s. 6d. per cwt., in 1871, 8s., and in 1881\u201382, 6s. 3d. per cwt.; millet (bajra), in 1850, 10\u00bdd. per cwt., in 1871, 4s. 10\u00bdd., and in 1881\u201382, 3s. 9d. per cwt.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014The District of Banda is specially exposed to the ravages of insects, of which no less than 16 destructive species are enumerated. They attack the wheat, rice, gram, and other grains, and one in particular affects the cotton. Some of them destroy as much as three-fourths of the crops. Floods are not serious, and in most cases prove beneficial. The District suffers much from drought, which was the main cause of the famine of 1869. Prices began to rise in April, and continued high till the end of the year. In May, as many as 10,943 persons were employed daily upon relief works. By the end of June the rains set in, and prevented the necessity for further relief. The maximum price of gram in 1869 was 10 seers for the rupee, or 11s. 2\u00bdd. per cwt. There was also considerable suffering in 1877\u201378 on account of drought. The point at which famine rates are reached varies in the different Fiscal Divisions (parganas). In Banda pargan\u00e1, where the population is densest, relief should be given when wheat sells at 22s. 4d. per cwt., and gram at 14s. per cwt. Elsewhere, famine rates are reached with wheat and gram at just half those prices. The communications of the\nDistrict with the Do\u00e1b are probably sufficient to avert the extremity of famine.\n\nCommerce and Trade.\u2014B\u00e1nda, though a poor agricultural District, has little trade. The Jumna is its main artery, and Chilla, on that river, is a considerable port of entry. The B\u00e1nda cotton is sufficiently well known in commerce to be called by its prefix as a trade name. The other principal exports are flax, gram, millets, wheat, and other grains. The chief imports are rice, sugar, and tobacco. The traffic on the Ken is small, owing to the shrinking of the river in the dry season. Manufactured articles are, for the most part, sold at the country fairs, none of which, however, are of any great importance. Coarse cotton cloth and copper utensils are made in the District for home use. Polished pebbles, found in the Ken, and cut into knife handles, brooches, seal-rings, and other ornamental articles, are exported in considerable quantities. There are several quarries in the southern hill country, which export durable sandstone for ornamental architecture, and other stone for metalling roads and for railway purposes. Iron is also found, and worked by companies of blacksmiths. The Jabalpur (Jubbulpore) branch of the East Indian Railway has a length of about 47 miles in the District, with three stations at Bargarh, M\u00e1nikpur, and M\u00e1rkundi. M\u00e1nikpur is connected with the town of B\u00e1nda by a road of 59\u00bd miles long; but as only a small portion is metalled, and as it is often impassable for goods during the rainy season, traffic proceeds chiefly by the well-metalled road to Chilla (24 miles) and thence across the Jumna to Fatehpur station on the East Indian main line. There are 586 miles of roads in the District. All of them, however, except that from B\u00e1nda to Chilli, need improvement. No institutions of any importance exist, and there are no newspapers or printing-presses in the District.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The District suffered much in the earlier part of the century from over-taxation. Under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Government, the State demand amounted to the whole possible out-turn of each village. On the first British Settlement of the whole District, in 1806, the land revenue amounted to \u00a3130,305, and in 1814 to \u00a3146,454. These assessments were not considered exorbitant. In 1815, the land revenue was raised to \u00a3192,122, and again, in 1819, to \u00a3203,650. This demand was met, but only by payments out of capital; and the result was soon seen in a general decrease of prosperity. In 1825, the assessment was reduced to \u00a3187,890; but the effects of the previous excessive demands, the spread of the k\u00e1ns weed, and a series of bad harvests, combined to impoverish B\u00e1nda. From that period to the Mutiny, the assessments, in spite of many fluctuations, were generally somewhat heavier than the District could bear. On the reoccupation after the Mutiny, it was necessary to make a considerable reduction.\nThe land assessment in 1870-71 amounted to \u00a3130,482, of which \u00a3130,476 were collected. Since then a reassessment of the whole District has been made, and the new settlement, which came into force in 1882, resulted in a further reduction of the land revenue demand to \u00a3116,231. There are 8 Fiscal Divisions or pargan\u00e1s, containing 1596 separate estates. The number of proprietors is returned at 25,591, classified as follows:\u2014Zamind\u00e1ri, 3187; pattid\u00e1ri, 21,293; bh\u00e1y\u00e1ch\u00e1ra, 1251; and revenue-free, 160. The total revenue in 1870-71 was \u00a3167,488, which in 1881 had decreased to \u00a3129,535.\n\nAs B\u00e1n\u00e1da forms a portion of the Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d Division, it is administered under the Regulation system organized in 1803. The civil jurisdiction of the whole District is in the hands of the Subordinate Judge. There are 13 magisterial, 2 civil, and 13 revenue and rent courts. The District contains 24 police stations and 11 outposts. The regular police, in 1880-81, amounted to 523 men, maintained at a cost of \u00a36580 from imperial funds. The municipal or town police in 1880 numbered 88 men, costing \u00a3590. There are also 1723 village watchmen (chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs). The District contains only one jail, the average number of prisoners in which was 555 in 1850, 121 in 1860, 292 in 1870, and 258 in 1880. Education is advancing slowly. In 1860, there were 3006 children under instruction; in 1870 the total had increased to 4966. In 1880-81, there were 142 schools, under Government inspection, and receiving State aid in the District, attended by 3884 pupils. This excludes uninspected and indigenous schools outside the Education Department. The Census Report of 1881 returned 5890 boys and 120 girls as under instruction in that year, besides 16,869 males and 149 females able to read and write, but not under instruction. The District contains two administrative Sub-divisions, B\u00e1n\u00e1da and Karwi.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The cold season in B\u00e1n\u00e1da is less intense than that of the neighbouring Districts, frost being very rare. The hot weather sets in about the middle of March, and the spring crops are cut by April. The atmosphere is distinguished by its clearness, fog and dust being almost unknown. The beautiful phenomenon of the mirage is often observed. On the other hand, this purity of the air contributes to the heat, and many deaths occur from exposure to the sun. Mean temperature\u2014January, 63\u00b04 F.; February, 61\u00b09\u00b0; March, 82\u00b05\u00b0; April, 94\u00b0; May, 96\u00b0; June, 94\u00b07\u00b0; July, 90\u00b06\u00b0; August, 86\u00b02\u00b0; September, 84\u00b05\u00b0; October, 83\u00b0; November, 75\u00b0; December, 63\u00b06\u00b0. The average annual rainfall for a period of 30 years ending 1881-82 was 39 inches, the rainfall in the latter year being 28\u00b09 inches, or 10 inches below the average. The climate is healthy for natives, but produces fever and ague among Europeans. The only endemic disease is malarial fever, which becomes epidemic from August to November. More\nthan two-thirds of the deaths are due to this cause; of other diseases complaints of the bowels are most fatal. Cattle-disease is occasionally prevalent, but not to any great extent.

Area, 427.8 square miles, of which 290 are cultivated; population (1881) 120,578 souls; land revenue, \u00a320,711; total revenue (including cesses) \u00a323,244; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a348,703; incidence of Government revenue, 2s. 11\u00bdd. per acre of total area. The tahsil contains 2 civil and 8 criminal courts, with 3 police circles (th\u00e1nd\u00e1s); strength of regular police, 262 men, besides village watchmen (chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs).\n\n**B\u00e1n\u00e1.**\u2014Chief town and administrative head-quarters of B\u00e1n\u00e1 District, North-Western Provinces. Stands on an undulating plain, 1 mile east of the right bank of the Ken river; distant 95 miles southwest from Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, 190 miles south-east from Agra, and 560 miles north-west from Calcutta. Lat. 25\u00b0 28\u2032 20\u2033 N., long. 80\u00b0 22\u2032 15\u2033 E. Population in 1872, 27,746. Population (1881) 28,974, comprising 20,459 Hindus; 7,998 Muhammadans; 249 Jains; 262 Christians; and 6 \u2018others.\u2019 Area of town site, 3483 acres. Municipal income in 1880\u201381, \u00a33001, of which \u00a32190 was derived from octroi. B\u00e1n\u00e1 is a modern town, deriving its first importance from the residence of the Naw\u00e1b of B\u00e1n\u00e1, and later on from its rising position as a cotton mart. After the removal of the Naw\u00e1b in 1858, owing to his disloyalty during the Mutiny (see BANDA DISTRICT), the town began to decline, while the growth of R\u00e1j\u00e1pur as a rival cotton emporium has largely deprived B\u00e1n\u00e1 of its principal trade. The population has accordingly decreased from 42,411 in 1853 to 28,974 in 1881. It is a straggling and ill-built town, but with clean, wide streets, containing 66 mosques, 161 Hindu temples, and 5 Jain temples, some of which possess fair architectural merit; tahs\u00edli, court-house, jail, dispensary, school-house, church. The Naw\u00e1b\u2019s palace has been partly demolished, partly converted into dwelling-houses. The antiquities of the place comprise the ruins of a palace built by the Ajaigarh R\u00e1j\u00e1s; the tomb of Gum\u00e1n Singh, R\u00e1ja of Jaitpur, in good preservation; and the remains of the Bh\u00faragarh fort beyond the Ken, stormed by the British forces in 1804. The cantonments are one mile from the town, on the Fatehpur road.\n\n**B\u00e1n\u00e1.**\u2014Tahsil in S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor) District, Central Provinces, lying between 23\u00b0 53\u2032 and 24\u00b0 26\u2032 N. lat., and between 78\u00b0 42\u2032 45\u2033 and 79\u00b0 17\u2032 45\u2033 E. long. Area, 701 square miles, of which 202 are cultivated\nand 229 returned as cultivable. Five square miles are reserved under the Forest Department. Population (1881) 82,333, namely, males 42,883, and females 39,450; number of villages, 273. The adult agricultural population numbers 32,561, or 39'55 per cent. of the total population of the tahsil; average area of cultivated and cultivable land, 8 acres per adult agriculturist. Total amount of Government land revenue, \u00a34865; total revenue, including cesses, \u00a35210, or an average of 10\u00bdd. per cultivated acre; rental paid by cultivators, including cesses, \u00a314,307, or an average of 2s. 2\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. In 1883, the tahsil contained 1 civil and 1 criminal court, with 2 police stations and 8 outposts. Strength of regular police, 79 men; of village watchmen (chaukidars), 203.\n\n**B\u00e1n\u00e1da.**\u2014Small town in S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor) District, Central Provinces, and unimportant, except as being the head-quarters of B\u00e1n\u00e1da tahsil, situated about 20 miles north-east of S\u00e1g\u00e1r town, on the main road to Cawnpur. Population (1881) 1313; houses, 336. Police station and village school.\n\n**Bandaj\u00e1n.**\u2014Pass in Muzafar\u00e1b\u00e1d Division of Kashmir State, Punjab, over a range of the Him\u00e1layas, covered with an unbroken sheet of perpetual snow. Lat. (summit) 31\u00b0 22' N., long. 78\u00b0 4' E.; elevation above the sea, 14,854 feet.\n\n**Bandam\u00farlanka.**\u2014Hamlet attached to the town of Kum\u00e1rigiri-patnam in God\u00e1vari District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 16\u00b0 25' N., long. 82\u00b0 1' E.; population (1881) 4380. Situated 18 miles east of Nars\u00e1pur, on the Vainateyam, or western mouth of the God\u00e1vari. One of the three earliest English settlements in the delta of that river. A factory established here early in the 18th century was shortly afterwards abandoned. It is still a small seaport.\u2014See Bandarulanka.\n\n**Bandar (Bandwar).**\u2014Tiluk in Kistna District, Madras Presidency. Area, 702 square miles. Land revenue, \u00a331,000. Houses, 30,779; population (1881) 175,482, thus classified according to sex\u2014males, 88,279; females, 87,203; distributed in 2 towns and 188 villages. Chief town, Masulipatam, or Bandar.\n\n**Bandar.**\u2014Town in Kistna District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See Masulipatam.\n\n**Band\u00e1rban.**\u2014Principal village of the Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bengal, and the residence of the Po\u00e1ng R\u00e1j\u00e1 (the Bohmong), situated on the Sangu river. Lat. 22\u00b0 12' 30\" N., long. 92\u00b0 16' 30\" E.; population about 3000. There is a permanent market here, at which considerable traffic is carried on. The hillmen bring down for sale timber (either rough or hewn into boats), cotton, bamboos, rattans, thatching-grass, sesamum, mustard, india-rubber, and occasionally small quantities of ivory and wax. They buy rice, salt, spices, dried fish, tobacco, cattle, piece-goods, trinkets, etc. The most interesting building in the\nvillage is a Buddhist temple, to which the people resort in large numbers at the time of their festival in May. Government middle-class Anglo-veracular school, with boarding department. Police station.\n\n**Band\u00e1rulanka.**\u2014Village in God\u00e1vari District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 16\u00b0 35' N., long. 82\u00b0 2' E. Population (1881) 2673, inhabiting 467 houses. Situated on the Kausika branch of the God\u00e1vari river.\n\n**Bandel.**\u2014Small village on the bank of the river H\u00fagl\u00ed, about a mile above H\u00fagl\u00ed town, in Bengal. Lat. 22\u00b0 55' N., long. 88\u00b0 26' E. Contains a Roman Catholic monastery, said to be the oldest Christian church in Bengal. A stone over the gateway bears the date 1599, but the original church founded in that year was burnt during the siege of H\u00fagl\u00ed by the Mughals in 1632, the images and pictures which it contained being destroyed by the command of the Emperor of Delhi. The present building was erected shortly afterwards; and the Emperor, on the intercession of one of the priests, who was taken prisoner to Agra, made a grant of 777 bigh\u00e1s (about 250 acres) of land rent-free to the monastery. In its early days, the Portuguese built a fort opposite it for its defence; and towards the close of last century there were, in addition to the monastery, a nunnery, a boarding school, and a college of Jesuits. The mixed descendants of the Portuguese and natives sank into a low depth of degradation on the decline of the Portuguese power, and Bandel became proverbial for the immorality of its women. The inhabitants are now pure Bengalis, with the exception of a few priests; and the taint which during more than a hundred years attached to Bandel, passed away with the disappearance of the last half-breed remnants of Portuguese rule. At present (1883), the establishment consists of a very small Portuguese mission. At the festival of the Novena, celebrated in November, a large number of Roman Catholics resort to the place. The name 'Bandel' is a corruption of bandar, a wharf or port.\n\n**Bandipallam** (*Vann\u00e1rap\u00e1l\u00e1yam*).\u2014Hill and stream in South Arcot District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 11\u00b0 43' 15\" N., long. 79\u00b0 48' E. A strategical point of importance in the Anglo-French campaigns of 1750 to 1780.\n\n**B\u00e1ndra** (*W\u00e1ndren Bandora, V\u00e1ndra*).\u2014Town in the Salsette Subdivision of Th\u00e1na District, Bombay Presidency; situated at the southern extremity of Salsette, at the point where that island is connected with the island of Bombay by a causeway and arched stone bridge; 9 miles north of Bombay. Lat. 19\u00b0 3' 5\" N., long. 72\u00b0 52' 30\" E.; population (1881) 14,987; municipal revenue, \u00a31536, or nearly 2s. per head; municipal expenditure, \u00a31459; average annual value of trade at the port of Bandra for 5 years\u2014exports \u00a32138, imports \u00a37505. The town has a post-office and a dispensary, and is a station on the\nBombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway. Since the opening of railway communication, Bandra has become a favourite place of resort for the citizens of Bombay.\n\n**Banga.**\u2014Town and municipality in Naw\u00e1shahr tahsil, Jalandhar (Jullundur) District, Punjab; 22 miles east of Jullundur (Jalandhar) town. Lat. $31^\\circ 11' 15''$ N., long. $76^\\circ 2'$ E. Population (1881) 4565, made up as follows:\u2014Hindus, 2767; Muhammadans, 763; Sikhs, 945; and Jains, 90. Occupied houses, 761. The town forms a local commercial centre, with a large trade in sugar, wheat, and country produce, manufacture of cotton cloth, and of brass and copper vessels. A well-built and paved town, with a dispensary, Government middle school, post-office, and police station. Municipal income (1880\u201381) \u00a3323; expenditure, \u00a3226.\n\n**Bang\u00e1hal.**\u2014Valley in K\u00e1ngra District, Punjab, forming the link between K\u00e1ngra Proper and the outlying dependency of Kullu. Lat. $32^\\circ 18'$ to $32^\\circ 29'$ N., long. $76^\\circ 49'$ to $76^\\circ 55'$ E. Consists of two mountain glens, divided from one another by the Dh\u00e1ola Dh\u00e1r range. The northern half, known as Bar\u00e1 Bang\u00e1hal, contains the head-waters of the R\u00e1vi, which issues already a considerable river into the Native State of Chamba. The area of Bar\u00e1 Bang\u00e1hal is 290 square miles; but it contains only one village, situated at the lowest point of the valley, some 8500 feet above the sea, and inhabited by a few Kanet families. Some years ago, a number of houses in the village were swept away by an avalanche. The mountains slope steeply up from the banks of the river, and rise into peaks of from 17,000 to over 20,000 feet, covered with glaciers and perpetual snow. Near the bottom of the ravines there is a good deal of pine forest, and higher up, long bare slopes, which, on the melting of the snows, afford splendid grazing for large flocks of sheep and goats. The southern half, known as Chhot\u00e1 Bang\u00e1hal, is again divided into two parts by a branch range 10,000 feet in height; its eastern fork contains the head-waters of the Ul river, and some eighteen small scattered villages, inhabited by Kanets and D\u00e1ghis. The western glen, known as the B\u00eer Bang\u00e1hal, does not differ in any material respect from the general aspect of the K\u00e1ngra District.\n\n**Bang\u00e1li.**\u2014River of North Bengal: rises in Rangpur, flows thence through a marshy tract which it drains by means of deep kh\u00e1ls, or water-channels, into Bogr\u00e1 District. In the latter District, after receiving the waters of the Man\u00e1s, it falls into the Halhali\u00e1 river, which ultimately joins the Phuljhur. The great marshes which cover the entire tract through which the river runs, empty themselves into it by means of deep kh\u00e1ls or drainage channels. In this way, in the rainy season, the Bang\u00e1li becomes the main artery by which boat traffic is extended all over the east of Bogr\u00e1 District; and on its banks, or on\nthose of its affluent kh\u00e1ls, are some of the principal trade marts of Eastern Bengal.\n\n**Bangalore (Bengaluru).** \u2014 District of Mysore State, Southern India, forming the southern portion of the Nandidr\u00fag (Nundydroog) Division. It lies between $12^\\circ 13'$ and $13^\\circ 30'$ N. lat., and between $77^\\circ 7'$ and $78^\\circ 3'$ E. long., being bordered on the south by the Madras Districts of Coimbatore and Salem. It contains an estimated area of 2901 square miles, of which 860 are cultivated, 818 are cultivable, and 1223 uncultivable waste. Greatest length from north to south, 85 miles; from east to west, 50 miles. The Census of 1881 returned a total population of 669,139 souls. The District is sub-divided into the following t\u00e1lus: Anekal, Bangalore, Closepet, Devanhalli, Dodballapur, Hoskot, Kankanhalli, Magadi, Nelamangala. The number of villages on the rent-roll is 5504. Land revenue (1881\u201382) \u00a393,864. Total revenue, \u00a3173,966. The civil and military headquarters are at the town of Bangalore (q.v.), which is also the administrative capital of the State. At the time of the restoration of the Province of Mysore to the young Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 in 1881, the cantonment part of Bangalore was separated and styled the civil and military station of Bangalore, under the administration of British officers. Excepting slight reductions in establishments, the constitution of the District remains much the same as in 1873.\n\n**Physical Aspects.** \u2014 The main portion of the District consists of the valley of the Ark\u00e1vat\u00ed river, which joins the K\u00e1veri (Cauvery) on the southern frontier; the eastern part is watered by the South Pin\u00e1kini (or Pennar). Towards the west, the country is broken by a succession of rugged hills and deep valleys; the remaining tract, which is open and undulating, forms part of the general table-land of Mysore, attaining at Bangalore town an elevation of 3113 feet above the sea. The low-lying lands are dotted with tanks for irrigation, varying in size from small ponds to considerable lakes, formed by embanking the minor streams. The uplands are often bare, or covered with low scrub jungle. The best known of the hills is the rock-fortress of S\u00e1vandr\u00fag, which towers to a height of 4024 feet: the sacred hill of Siva-ganga is about 500 feet higher. The Ark\u00e1vat\u00ed river runs a total course of about 120 miles. During the hot season its sandy bed only contains a thin, trickling stream; but in the rains, heavy freshets come down, bearing along large uprooted trees and logs of timber. Its maximum flood discharge is calculated at 50,000 cubic feet of water per second. The prevailing formation is gneiss, disrupted by dikes of trap and porphyritic rocks; adularia, pink felspar, chert, corundum, chalcedony, mica, and hornblende are found; hematite iron ore is abundant, and a nodular limestone yields excellent lime, which bears a high polish. The gneiss rock is extensively quarried for building purposes, and supplies solid\ncolumns 35 feet long. Potter's clay is utilized by the native workmen, and various kinds of kaolinitic clay exist, specimens of which have been favourably reported upon in England. The prevailing soil is the red or kempu, a loam of great fertility, varying in colour from a light red to a deep chocolate; the darker sorts are supposed to be caused by the weathering down of the trap rocks. The decomposed gneiss gives the saulu earth, grey, sandy, and sterile soils, and the kaolinitic clays. Low jungle abounds in most parts of the District. The demand for fuel created by the railway, and the increasing consumption at Bangalore town, have led to the formation of large wood plantations. State forests cover an area of about 32 square miles. Avenues have been planted along all the public roads, and ornamental trees have recently been introduced into the station of Bangalore, with most picturesque results. Wild animals are not so abundant as in the mountainous tracts bordered by the Western Ghats.\n\nHistory.\u2014The tract now known as Bangalore District has often figured prominently in the annals of Southern India. The little town of Kankanhalli is generally identified as the Konkanapura of the Buddhist pilgrim, Hwen Thsang, who traversed India in the 7th century A.D. The earliest local legends are associated with the ruins of Nandag\u00fadi and Mal\u00far; but authentic history begins with the Gang\u00e1 dynasty, who are said to have ruled over a great part of Southern India after the commencement of the Christian era. At least two sovereigns of this line are known to have fixed their residence at Mal\u00far or Muganda-patna. The Gang\u00e1s were succeeded in about 900 A.D. by the Cholas, who were shortly afterwards overthrown in their turn by the Ball\u00e1l dynasty.\n\nVira Ball\u00e1l, who reigned 1191 to 1211 A.D., is the traditional founder of Bangalore town. The Ball\u00e1l dynasty was destroyed by the Muhammadans in 1364; and amid the general disorder, a family of Telugu immigrants, known as the Mor\u00e1su Wokk\u00e1lu, established themselves as feudatories of the Vijayanagar kings. The chief of the family bore the name of Gauda. His capital was at Magadi, with S\u00e1vandr\u00fag as a stronghold in time of danger. The next conqueror to appear on the scene is the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Sh\u00e1hj\u00ed, the father of Sivaji the Great. He had received Bangalore and Kol\u00e1r, with other neighbouring tracts, as a j\u00e1gir or feudal grant from the Muhammadan prince of Bij\u00e1pur. He made Bangalore his residence, and his government extended over the whole of 'Karnatic Bij\u00e1pur.' Like his more illustrious son, Sh\u00e1hj\u00ed found his opportunity in playing off against one another the rival Musalm\u00e1n kingdoms of Delhi, Bij\u00e1pur, and Ahmadnagar, by which means he was enabled to establish his independence in the remote and fertile Principality of Tanjore. On his death, in 1664, the inheritance was disputed between his two sons, Sivaji and Venkoj\u00ed or Ekoj\u00ed; but\nSivaji finally withdrew to his native hills near P\u00fana (Poona), leaving his brother in undisputed possession of the southern dominions of Sh\u00e1hji.\n\nMeanwhile the Wadey\u00e1rs of Mysore, the ancestors of the existing royal family, were rising to power. In 1610 they had gained possession of Seringapatam, and in 1654 the Gauda chief of Magadi was rendered tributary to them. The distant authority of Venkoji, who had not inherited the military instincts of his family, appears to have been merely nominal; and in 1687 he offered to sell his rights over Bangalore to the more warlike R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Mysore, for three l\u00f3khs of rupees (\u00a330,000). This transaction was interrupted by the arrival of K\u00e1sim Kh\u00e1n, a general of Aurangzeb, who occupied the fortress for a few days, but ultimately consented to hand it over to the Mysore R\u00e1j\u00e1, on the same terms that had been offered by Venkoji. Thus, in July 1687, Bangalore became a part of the kingdom of Mysore, but the entire District was not subjected till sixty years later. The representatives of the Gauda line still lingered at Magadi, and retained possession of the fortress of S\u00e1vandr\u00fag, while another member of the same family ruled at Devanhalli. In 1728 Magadi and S\u00e1vandr\u00fag were taken, and Devanhalli fell in 1749. It was in the siege of the latter town that Haidar Ali first distinguished himself as a volunteer horseman in the Mysore service, and it was at the same spot that his son and successor, Tipu, was afterwards born. In reward for his valour, Haidar Ali was presented in 1758 with the fort and District of Bangalore, which thus formed the original nucleus of his wide empire; and both Bangalore and Devanhalli were always natural objects of solicitude to himself and his son.\n\nIn 1791, Bangalore was captured from Tipu, by the British under Lord Cornwallis, without much opposition: the other strong places surrendered, and the rock-fortress of S\u00e1vandr\u00fag was stormed after five days' bombardment. On the capture of Seringapatam and death of Tipu, in 1799, the District was included by the treaty of Seringapatam within the territory of the restored Hindu R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Mysore. In 1811, owing to the excessive unhealthiness of Seringapatam, the British troops were removed to the town of Bangalore, which has henceforth continued to be the administrative capital of the State, where a palace has been built for the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1, who divides his time between Bangalore and Mysore. Under the Native government, Bangalore and Kolar Districts constituted the faujd\u00e1r\u00ed of Bangalore, which was subsequently termed the Bangalore Division, until the formation of the Nandidr\u00fag (Nundydroog) Division in 1863, when the name of Bangalore was confined to the District. Bangalore formed the head-quarters District of the British administration of Mysore from the time when we took charge of the State in 1831, until its rendition to the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Mysore in 1881.\nPopulation.\u2014A kh\u00e1na sumari, or house enumeration of the people, in 1853-54 returned a population of 618,506 souls. The regular Census of 1871 showed the numbers to be 828,354, giving an increase of nearly 40 per cent. in the interval of 18 years, if the earlier figures can be trusted. The Census of 1881 returned a population of 669,139 souls, a number nearly one-fourth less than the figures of 1871, and nearly equal to the enumeration of 1853-54, giving an average of 231 persons per square mile. This enormous decrease was caused by the mortality caused by the terrible famine which desolated Southern India in 1876-78. Classified according to sex, there are 330,820 males and 338,319 females. As regards occupation, 264,014 persons are returned as connected with agriculture, and 465,125 with manufacture and arts.\n\nThe religious division of the people shows\u2014Hindus, including 490 Jains, 593,612, or 88\u00b77 per cent.; Muhammadans, 55,591, or 8\u00b73 per cent.; Christians, 19,917, or 2\u00b79 per cent.; 11 P\u00e1rs\u00eds; and 8 Buddhists. The Hindus are further sub-divided, according to the two great sects, into worshippers of Vishnu, and worshippers of Siva. The Br\u00e1hmans number 26,309, chiefly belonging to the Smarta sect; the claimants to the rank of Kshattriyas are returned at 10,817, among whom the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s number 8497; the Satan\u00eds number 3059, the Kom\u00e1tis 5094, and the Nagarthas 5412. Of inferior castes, the most numerous is the Wokliga (157,122), who are agricultural labourers; the Ling\u00e1yats (32,894) have always been very influential in this part of the country; the K\u00faruba caste of shepherds numbers 32,467; the Banajiga, traders, 26,252; the Tiglars, market gardeners, 24,463. In Bangalore town, 14 persons, including 3 women, entered themselves as adherents of the Br\u00e1hma Sam\u00e1j, but the real number is believed to be greater. The Musalm\u00e1ns, as might be anticipated, muster strongest in the tiluk of Bangalore. The great majority are returned as Deccani Muhammadans, and there are only 126 Wah\u00e1b\u00eds. Out of the total of 19,917 Christians, 15,294 are found in the town of Bangalore, where, apart from the strength of the garrison, there are many European pensioned soldiers. The Europeans altogether number 4723, and the Eurasians 2546, leaving 12,648 for the native converts. Of the total Christians, 4922 belong to the Church of England; 13,186 to the Romish Church; 11,809 to other persuasions.\n\nThe District contains 5504 towns and villages, with 108,466 inhabited houses. As compared with the area and population, these figures yield the following averages:\u2014Villages per square mile, 1\u00b79; houses per square mile, 37\u00b73; persons per village, 121\u00b75; persons per house, 6\u00b720. The town and cantonments of Bangalore, which are fully described in the following article, cover an area of nearly 14 square miles, and contain a total population of 155,857 souls. The following are the five other principal towns:\u2014Dod-Ballapur,\n7932; Anekal, 5995; Sukravarpet, 5840; Devanhalli, 5774; and Closepet, 4832. Including Bangalore town and cantonment, there are seventeen municipalities in the District, with an aggregate municipal revenue in 1880-81 of \u00a321,770, of which amount Bangalore itself is credited with \u00a320,466. The celebrated rock-fortress of Savandurg and the yet higher hill of Sivaganga, a frequented place of pilgrimage, are both situated in the north-west of the District.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The principal cultivation of the District consists of 'dry' crops, rice being comparatively neglected. The great food staple is ragi (Cynosurus corocanus), which also furnishes the necessary fodder for the cattle. Various millets and pulses are grown, and a little wheat. Rice is chiefly sown in the low-lying areas beneath large tanks, and in the neighbourhood of wells; but the out-turn is somewhat uncertain, and the growing crop is liable to blight. The chief oil-seeds raised are gingelli (Sesamum orientale) and the castor-oil plant. Mulberry cultivation for the support of silkworms has much declined in recent years. Opium and poppy are cultivated in certain tracts. The most valuable of the 'wet' crops is sugar-cane, which requires to be well cared for and highly manured. Vegetables, both of indigenous and European sorts, are largely grown for the markets of Bangalore and Madras; and the example of the Lal Bagh in Bangalore town has led to the introduction of many flowering plants from England.\n\nThe average rates of rent, in 1880-81, per acre of land suited for rice, was 12s. 9d.; wheat, 13s. 9\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)d.; inferior grains, 2s. 11\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)d.; oil-seeds, 3s.; fibres, 2s.; sugar-cane, 23s. 3d.; and tobacco, 11s. The average produce per acre of land, in pounds, was of rice, 1409; of wheat, 970; of inferior grains, 580; of oil-seeds, 433; of fibres, 120; of sugar-cane, 2611; and of tobacco, 194 pounds. The following are the agricultural statistics for 1881:\u2014Area under rice, 39,485 acres; wheat, 13; other food-grains, 467,863; oil-seeds, 22,846; sugar-cane, 2170; tobacco, 664; vegetables, 4952; mulberry, 4450; cocoa-nut and arecanut, 8077; lac, 178 acres. The agricultural stock is returned at 12,183 carts, and 65,095 ploughs; the number of tanks at 3430. The current prices ruling in the District in 1880-81, per maund of 80 lbs., were, for rice, 6s. 8\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)d.; wheat, 6s. 9d.; cotton, 49s. 3d.; sugar, 20s. 7\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d.; salt, 8s.; gram, from 6s. to 2s.; ragi, 2s. 4\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d.; pulses, 5s. 9\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)d.; tobacco, 45s. 9d.; poppy-seeds, 12s. 3d.; and salt, 4s. to 9s. The rate of wages for skilled labour is 6d. to 1s. 6d.; unskilled, from 3d. to 6d. per day. The number of domestic animals is estimated as follows:\u2014Cows and bullocks, 307,581; horses, 743; ponies, 2112; donkeys, 10,608; sheep and goats, 269,298; pigs, 1083. Elephants and camels are only kept by the Commissariat Department. A few horses are bred by the silladirs from country mares and Government stallions,\nbut the majority are imported. The cattle are of an excellent breed, and the rearing of bulls for sale forms a favourite occupation of well-to-do r\u0101yats. Buffaloes are not much used for ploughing. Sheep and goats thrive well; the wool of the former, however, is of a coarse description, and only used for the manufacture of native blankets and horse rugs. An attempt made by Government to introduce the merino breed of sheep has not proved successful.\n\nManufactures, etc.\u2014The manufacture of cotton cloths and coarse woollen blankets, or kamblis, is a common industry in all parts of the District. The finer sorts of cloth are woven with some admixture of silk, and with silk borders. The production of raw silk is confined to the Muhammadan section of the community, and has much declined in recent years owing to epidemic diseases among the indigenous worms. In 1866 an Italian gentleman imported a superior breed of worms from Japan, and established a large filature at the town of Kengeri; but the enterprise failed from the same cause. Silk cloth, of durable texture and costly patterns, is woven by the patveg\u0101rs of Bangalore, and sold by weight at the rate of 8s. to 10s. a tol\u0101. Other specialties are the lacquered ware, glass ornaments, and steel wire for musical instruments, made at Channapatna. In the Magadi t\u0101luk, a good deal of iron is worked in the native fashion, and some steel. The handicrafts of Bangalore town are those necessarily found in a great city. Carpet-making is carried on with great success in the central jail, and the carpets there made, after Persian and Turkish designs, sell in Europe at prices ranging from \u00a31, 4s. per square yard.\n\nThe commerce of the District, which is carried on both with the east and west coasts, centres at the busy b\u0101z\u0101r of the native quarter of Bangalore. The other principal marts of trade are Channapatna, Dod-ballapur, Sarjapur, Vadagenhalli, and Tyamagondal. A cattle fair held annually at Husk\u016br, a village in the Anek\u0101l t\u0101luk, is attended by about 3000 persons, and 10,000 bullocks are brought for sale. The Bangalore branch of the Madras Railway runs through the District for about 20 miles, with its terminus at Bangalore town; and the Mysore State Railway\u2014opened in July 1882,\u2014from Bangalore city to Mysore, for about 42 miles. There are 511 miles of made roads in the District.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In the year 1881\u201382 the total revenue of Bangalore District amounted to \u00a3173,966. The chief items were\u2014Land revenue, \u00a393,864; \u0101bk\u0101ri or excise, \u00a354,135; law and justice, \u00a33389. In 1870\u201371, the number of separate estates was 932, owned by 3651 registered proprietors or coparceners. During 1880, the average daily prison population of the central jail was 837, of whom 55 were females. These figures show 1\u00b725 persons in jail for every 1000 of the District population; but it must be recollected that the central\njail contains many long-term convicts from the entire State of Mysore. In the same year, the District police force consisted of 1 superior officer, 53 subordinate officers, and 527 constables; the town and cantonment police of 1 superintendent, 4 superior officers, 62 subordinate officers, and 230 constables; making a total of 878 men of all ranks, maintained at an aggregate cost of \u00a313,797, of which \u00a33806 was paid from local sources. According to these figures, there is 1 policeman to every 3'3 square miles of the District area, or to every 766 of the population; while the cost averages \u00a34, 15s. id. per square mile, and 4\u00bdd. per head of population. The number of schools in 1880-81 aided and inspected by Government was 234, attended by 10,775 scholars, being 1 school to every 12'4 square miles, and 16 scholars to every thousand of the population.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Bangalore town and the surrounding country is noted for its healthiness, but in the hilly jungles towards the west and south, malarious fever is endemic. The mean annual temperature is 76\u00b02 F., the extreme range in any single year having been 42\u00b0. The average annual rainfall is 36 inches, distributed over about 90 days. The heaviest fall generally occurs during the prevalence of the north-east monsoon in October; from December to May there is usually little or no rain. The most prevalent disease is malarious fever, frequently attended with enlargement of the spleen; it is most common at the beginning and close of the monsoons. Cholera occasionally appears in an epidemic form, attributed to importation from Madras. Small-pox is always more or less prevalent during the hot season, and at the commencement of the rains, though vaccination is now systematically conducted in every tiluk. Pneumonia in natives, and congestion of the lungs in Europeans, are common. In recent years there have been some cases of typhoid fever, confined to the European population. On the other hand, the severe but not fatal epidemic of dengue fever in 1872 was almost entirely limited to the natives. Out of a total number of 10,003 deaths reported in 1880, 5,470 were assigned to fevers, 82 to small-pox, 563 to bowel complaints, 4 to cholera, 11 to suicide, and 24 to snake-bite or wild animals; to all other causes, 3,849. The births registered for 1880 were 8,333 males, and 7,941 females; total, 16,274. There are two charitable establishments at Bangalore for the relief of the sick\u2014the Bowring Civil Hospital and the Pit Dispensary. In 1880 a total of 1,441 in-patients were treated at the hospital, and the number of deaths was 221, or 153'3 per thousand; the out-patients numbered 24,825. The dispensary in-patients numbered 247 during the year 1880, of whom 1 died; the number of out-patients was 21,215.\n\n[For further information regarding Bangalore District, see the Mysore Vol. II.]\nBangalore City and Cantonment (Bengaluru: literally, \u2018Town of bengalu\u2019\u2014a kind of bean).\u2014The chief town of the District and taluk of the same name, and the seat of Government for the State of Mysore, situated in $12^\\circ 57' 37''$ N. lat., and $77^\\circ 36' 56''$ E. long.; 71 miles north-east of Seringapatam, and 216 miles by rail west of Madras. The town is divided into two parts\u2014the p\u00e9t, or old native quarter, including the fort; and the cantonments. The total area is $13\\frac{1}{2}$ square miles, and the population, according to the Census of 1881, amounts to 155,857 souls,\u2014town, 62,317; cantonment, 93,540. This tract was assigned to the British on the rendition of Mysore to its native prince in 1881.\n\nGeneral Appearance.\u2014The city of Bangalore stands in the centre of the Mysore table-land, 3113 feet above the sea. The general level is only broken by a few slight elevations, and the plain is interspersed with several large tanks. The fort lies on the extreme south-west, north of which is the p\u00e9t, or old native quarter; the cantonments stretch away towards the north-east, terminating in the new native quarter of the cantonment b\u00e1zar. Beyond this again is the suburb of St. John\u2019s Hill, or Cleveland Town, dotted with the little cottages of a large number of European pensioned soldiers, which, with the spire of its parish church, presents somewhat the appearance of an English village. The large open space between the two native quarters contains the race-course, the Cubbon Park, and the parade ground. Here also are situated the chief Government offices, and the houses of the European residents, each encircled by its own green compound. The railway station is in the extreme north, and in the opposite direction, beyond the fort, is the L\u00e1l B\u00e1gh, or \u2018horticultural gardens.\u2019 When the British assumed the direct administration of Mysore in 1831, the principal departments of Government found accommodation in the palace inside the fort. In 1868, new offices were erected in the cantonments; and the old palace, a large two-storied building of mud, has been suffered to fall into decay. The arsenal still remains within the fort. A proposal in 1884 to demolish the Fort of Bangalore evoked strong remonstrances from the Anglo-Indian community, seconded by the opposition of the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 of Mysore. The place forms one of the most historical sites in Southern India. The original Hindu fort was of mud, and is said to have been erected in 1537. The Muhammadans rebuilt it in stone in 1761, the first year of Haidar Ali\u2019s reign. It formed the traditional scene of the first captivity of Sir David Baird after Baillie\u2019s defeat at Peramb\u00e1kam in 1780; and it was taken by Lord Cornwallis in 1791, in the series of military operations against Tipu Sult\u00e1n known as the third Mysore War. Its dungeons were\nexplored, and pathetic traces of the captivity of British officers came to light. In 1811, on the removal of the British garrison from Seringapatam to Bangalore, the fort afforded quarters to some of our troops. The arsenal was transferred from Seringapatam to the Bangalore fort in 1823, and, as above mentioned, still remains within it. The following description is taken from an article in the Calcutta Englishman:\n\n'The form of the fort is oval, with round towers at proper intervals. It had, when captured by the British, five powerful cavaliers, a fausse-braye, a good ditch, and covered way without palisades, but the glacis was imperfect in some parts. The two gateways, one in the north and the other in the south, were called the Delhi and Mysore gates. The former, which opened towards the pet (or town), was a handsome structure in the best style of Muhammadan military architecture, and consisted of several gates surmounted by traverses. But, there being no ditches between the gates, an enemy taking possession of the works over the first gateway had a ready communication with all the others, which the British troops, who stormed the fort at this point, took advantage of.' The fortifications are now interesting from an antiquarian rather than from a military point of view. The prison cell of Sir David Baird and his fellow-captive is from twelve to fifteen feet square, with so low a roof that a man can scarcely stand upright.\n\nThe pet, or old native quarter, is very densely populated; there are 12,647 houses, with 62,317 inhabitants, in an area of 2\u00bd square miles. Until the last few years, the pet was surrounded by a deep ditch and a thick-set hedge, a memorial from the times of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 inroads. The streets are, for the most part, narrow and irregularly built, but there are not a few handsome houses owned by wealthy merchants. The course of trade is brisk, especially in the grain and cotton markets; and altogether the pet presents the appearance of a prosperous oriental city.\n\nThe following are the chief buildings scattered over the wide area known as the cantonments, which cover 11\u00bc square miles, with a population of 93,540 persons. Government House, the residence formerly of the Chief Commissioner, now of the Resident, of Mysore, and the fine range of new public offices, rise amid the wooded grounds of Cubbon Park, to the west of the parade ground. The public offices, erected at a cost of \u00a350,000, occupy a long two-storied building, in the Grecian style of architecture; the lower storey is all of stone surrounded with verandahs. The central jail covers a large space; it is built on the radiating principle, with workshops for many trades, and is surrounded by grounds kept under cultivation by the prisoners. The High School (now the Central College) contains a hall, with a roof supported by light monolithic columns, 35 feet high, quarried in the neighbourhood. In the extreme\nnorth of the town a handsome palace, of hewn stone, has been recently built for the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1. There are altogether eight churches of the different Christian sects, and many Hindu temples and Muhammadan mosques. Bangalore is the head-quarters of the Mysore Division of the Madras army, and contains separate barracks for artillery, cavalry, and infantry, as well as Sepoy lines. The L\u00e1l B\u00e1gh, about a mile east of the fort, is a beautiful pleasure garden, said to have been first laid out in the time of Haidar Ali. It is now under the charge of a European superintendent from Kew, and contains a rare collection of tropical and sub-tropical plants. Irrigation is supplied from a neighbouring tank. Periodical flower and fruit shows are held, and the weekly gathering at the band stand attracts large numbers both of Europeans and natives.\n\nHistory.\u2014Bangalore is not an ancient city, though it figures prominently as a place of military importance in the recent history of Mysore. The fort is said to have been founded in 1537 by Kempe Gauda, the ancestor of a line of local chieftains whose chief residence was at Magadi, with S\u00e1vandr\u00fag as their hill fortress. In 1638, Bangalore was captured by Rand-ulla Kh\u00e1n, the general of the Adil Sh\u00e1h\u00ed Prince of Bijapur, the representative at that time of the Muhammadan power in the Deccan (Dakshin). The first Bijapur deputy-governor of these southern conquests was the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Sh\u00e1hj\u00ed, father of the more celebrated Sivaj\u00ed. The fort of Bangalore was included in the j\u00e1g\u00edr granted to Sh\u00e1hj\u00ed, in order to attach him to the cause of Bijapur. This j\u00e1g\u00edr descended to his degenerate son Venkoji, or Ekoji, who preferred the security of his distant throne at Tanjore, and consented to sell Bangalore to the Hindu W\u00e1deyar of Mysore, who was then rising to power. For a few days the fort was occupied by K\u00e1s\u00edm Kh\u00e1n, the general of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, who finally surrendered it to the Mysore R\u00e1j\u00e1 for \u00a330,000, the sum which had originally been agreed upon with Venkoji.\n\nThis transfer took place in 1687. Bangalore is not again mentioned in history until 1758, when the fort and surrounding District were conferred as a j\u00e1g\u00edr upon Haidar Ali, in consideration of his military services to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Mysore against the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. During the period when Haidar Ali was conspiring against his Hindu master with varying success, Bangalore was always his military headquarters, and a safe retreat in time of danger. In 1761, the first year of his independence, he commenced the enlargement of the fort, and built the existing walls and towers of stone. During his reign, and also during that of his son Tipu, though Seringapatam was the recognised capital, the palace inside the fort of Bangalore was often occupied by the royal harem. In 1791, in the course of what is known as the third Mysore war, Bangalore was besieged by the British army,\nled by Lord Cornwallis in person. Despite the active opposition of Tipu Sultan, who kept the open field, the pet or native town was entered on the 7th March, and on the 21st of the same month the fort was taken by assault. The storming party advanced at midnight, beneath a bright moon; the garrison offered a respectable resistance, and their losses were severe. On the fall of Seringapatam and the death of Tipu Sultan in 1799, the State of Mysore was restored to a descendant of the old line of Hindu Wodeyars, and a British force was stationed at Seringapatam.\n\nIn 1811, owing to the unhealthiness of Seringapatam, Bangalore was selected as the military station; and subsequently, in 1831, when the State was taken under British administration, the civil offices of Government were also placed at Bangalore, which has thus gradually risen to be the acknowledged capital both of the District of Bangalore and of the State of Mysore, though the town of Mysore still remains the nominal capital of the State. Under British administration, Bangalore has greatly prospered both in commercial wealth and in the outward marks of civilisation. It now ranks next after Agra as the thirteenth most populous town in India. The needs of the military garrison have caused large open spaces to be left, which serve both for ornament and recreation. Many handsome public buildings have been erected of the stone quarried in the neighbourhood. A regular water supply is provided from numerous large tanks, and the sewage is conveyed away to be utilized on municipal farms. The healthiness of the climate has permitted a large colony of European pensioners to establish themselves in the suburbs, who confer a peculiarly English aspect upon the social system of the city.\n\nPopulation. \u2014 According to official returns, the population of Bangalore city amounted to 134,628 souls in 1852, 175,630 souls in 1858, and 142,513 souls in 1871. The regular Census of 1881 disclosed a total of 155,857 inhabitants in an area of 13\u00bd square miles. If the early figures are to be trusted, it would appear that the population has not materially increased in recent years. Of the total number in 1881, 77,927 are males and 77,930 females; proportion of males, 50\u00b0 per cent. The Hindus number 108,893, or 74\u00b0 per cent.; the Muhammadans, 29,521, or 15\u00b0 per cent.; the Christians, 17,430, or 10\u00b0 per cent. of the total population; and 'others,' 13. Among the Hindus are included 224 Jains. The unusual proportion of Christians is partly to be explained by the existence of the European troops in the cantonments, and also of a large colony of married pensioners. As many as 2756 Europeans and 334 Eurasians are classed as 'military officials' in the Census returns. The following table, compiled from the Census Report, shows the population of both the pet and the cantonments, classified according to religion and race:\u2014\n**Population of Bangalore (1881).**\n\n|                  | Pet.   | Cantonments. | Total  |\n|------------------|--------|--------------|--------|\n| Hindus            | 52,696 | 56,197       | 108,893|\n| Muhammadans      | 8,688  | 20,833       | 29,521 |\n| Others           | 1      | 12           | 13     |\n| Christians\u2014      |        |              |        |\n| Europeans        | 2      | 4,096        | 4,098  |\n| Eurasians        | 6      | 2,411        | 2,417  |\n| Native converts  | 650    | 8,129        | 8,779  |\n| Total Christians | 932    | 16,498       | 17,430 |\n| Grand total      | 62,317 | 93,540       | 155,857|\n\n**Manufactures and Trade.**\u2014Most of the trades characteristic of a large city are represented in Bangalore. In former years the production of raw silk was a flourishing industry, confined to the Muhammadan section of the community, but it has now greatly declined owing to continued mortality among the worms. Silks of durable texture and brilliant patterns are still woven by patw\u00e1rs, and sold by weight at from Rs. 4 to Rs. 5 per tol\u00e1. The common country cotton cloth is made in large quantities, the finer kinds with silk borders. Bangalore is noted for its manufacture of carpets. The common drugget with reversible pattern, called jamkh\u00e1n\u00ed, sells at from 1s. to 2s. 6d. per square yard; the rugs and pile carpets (ratn\u00e1 kambli) fetch from 8s. per square yard upwards. The carpets made in the central jail, after Persian and Turkish designs, are in great demand even in the English market. Other specialties are the manufacture of gold and silver lace, and of electro-plating and the tanning of leather. The handicrafts, stimulated by the presence of European civilisation, include printing, book-binding, lithography, photography, coach-building, and cabinet-making. A steam woollen factory has lately been started, and is fairly successful. In both quarters of the town are busy markets. In the pet, the public market is situated between the fort and the Mysore gate. But business is conducted everywhere amid the crowded thoroughfares, especially at open stalls along either side of the Doddap\u00e9t. The European shops are mostly in the cantonment b\u00e1z\u00e1r, in which also a commodious and well-kept market-place has recently been laid out. The Bangalore branch of the Madras Railway has its terminus in Bangalore. Its total length from the Jollarp\u00e9t junction is 84 miles, of which 53 lie within the limits of the State of Mysore, with 3 stations exclusive of the terminus. There were in 1881 altogether 29 joint-stock companies for banking or trade, registered in Bangalore city.\nlargest is the Bangalore Bank, established in 1868 with a capital of \u00a370,000.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The municipality of Bangalore consists of two distinct boards, one for the pet, and one for the cantonments, but both under one president. The members of the two boards consist of Commissioners nominated by Government to represent the interests of the several wards or divisions, together with eleven ex officio members. The following tables show the municipal balance-sheet for the year 1880-81:\n\n**Receipts of the Bangalore City and Cantonment Municipalities for 1880-81.**\n\n| Description                        | Pet.   | Cantonments |\n|------------------------------------|--------|-------------|\n| Octroi on tobacco, betel-leaf, and areca-nut, | \u00a32194  | \u00a34360       |\n| Tax on buildings and lands,        | 699    | 4531        |\n| Tax on professions and trades,     | 1912   | 2359        |\n| Rents                             | 646    | 623         |\n| Fines                             | 17     | 66          |\n| Miscellaneous                      | 525    | 2528        |\n| **Total**                         | **\u00a35993** | **\u00a314,467** |\n\n**Expenditure of the Bangalore City and Cantonment Municipalities for 1880-81.**\n\n| Description                        | Pet.   | Cantonments |\n|------------------------------------|--------|-------------|\n| Collection                         | \u00a3497   | \u00a31154       |\n| Head office charges                | 493    | 890         |\n| Public works                       | 1239   | 4880        |\n| Police                            | 1820   | 2010        |\n| Conservancy                        | 958    | 2059        |\n| Road-watering                      | 6      | 103         |\n| Lighting                           | 226    | 765         |\n| Miscellaneous                      | 350    | 870         |\n| Water supply                       | 220    | 80          |\n| Registration and sanitary charges  | 64     | 513         |\n| **Total**                         | **\u00a35863** | **\u00a313,324** |\n\nThe total income of the two municipal boards in 1880-81 amounted to \u00a320,460, or an average of 2s. 7\u00bdd. per head of the population, 155,807, within municipal limits. In the year 1881, the total strength of the municipal police force was 297 officers and men, maintained at an aggregate cost of \u00a37448, of which \u00a33806 was paid from municipal sources. These figures show 1 policeman to every 525 of the population, and a charge upon the taxpayer of 11\u00bdd. per head. In the same year, the military force stationed in the cantonments consisted of 1 battery of horse artillery, and 2 field batteries; 1 regiment of European cavalry, and 1 regiment of European infantry; 4 companies of sappers\nand miners, and 2 regiments of Madras Native Infantry. In former days the strength of the garrison at Bangalore was much greater. The Bangalore Rifle Volunteers (a force first enrolled in 1868) consists of 4 companies, numbering 356 officers and men, and a cadet company 59 strong.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Bangalore is noted for its healthiness, being well suited to the constitutions both of Europeans and natives. The mean annual temperature is $76.2^\\circ$ F.; the average annual rainfall is 36 inches. The registration returns for 1880 show a death-rate in the p\u00e9t of 16.93 per 1000, and a birth-rate of 18.80; in the cantonments the death-rate was 14.72 per 1000, and the birth-rate, 22.19. There was a severe outbreak of cholera in the cantonments in 1875; the death-rate in that year was 20.54 per 1000.\n\nBang\u00e1napalli.\u2014Estate in Karn\u00fal (Kurnool) District, Madras.\u2014See BANAGANAPALLI.\n\nB\u00e1ngang\u00e1 (Utangan).\u2014A river of R\u00e1jput\u00e1na; rises in the hills near Manoharpur, about 25 miles due north of Jaipur (Jeypore), and flows south-east for about 25 miles, until it reaches a range of hills near R\u00e1mgarh. After forcing its way through these hills in a deep gorge, about 1 mile in length, from 350 to 500 feet wide and 400 feet deep, it continues its course due east for about 65 miles, when it enters the Bhartpur (Bhurtpore) State near Mowah, at a point about 65 miles east of the range of hills above mentioned. It is crossed by the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na State Railway. The stream in the gorge near R\u00e1mgarh is perennial, but below this point the bed dries up except during the rains. The banks are generally about 20 feet in height, and clearly defined. In floods, which last for a few hours, the stream becomes impassable, and in the gorge near R\u00e1mgarh, the water rises sometimes to a height of 23 feet. After flowing through Bhartpur (Bhurtpore) and Dholpur States into Agra District, North-Western Provinces, it joins the Jumna (Jamun\u00e1) in lat. $27^\\circ$ N. and long. $78^\\circ 32'$ E., after a course of about 200 miles. A temple, called Jumwa-Devi, situated in the gorge, is visited by the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Jaipur on their accession to the gad\u00ed. Here they are shaved, the process being part of the ceremony connected with the accession.\n\nB\u00e1ngang\u00e1 (Arrow-river).\u2014A hill stream rising in the south of Nep\u00e1l, which, after forming the boundary between Nep\u00e1l State and the Oudh tarai, flows into Basti District, and after a course of about 18 miles joins the B\u00farhi R\u00e1pti at Karmani-gh\u00e1t. A considerable quantity of timber is floated down this river from the Nep\u00e1l forests.\n\nBang\u00e1on (Bongong).\u2014Sub-division of Nadiy\u00e1 District, Bengal, lying between $22^\\circ 52'$ and $23^\\circ 25' 15''$ N. lat., and between $88^\\circ 42'$ and $89^\\circ 4' 45''$ E. long.; area, 649 square miles; population (1881) 362,126, comprising 136,883 Hindus, 225,208 Muhammadans, and 35 'others;'\nnumber of towns or villages, 736\u2014of houses, 70,236, of which 68,144 are occupied; average density of the population, 558 per square mile; number of villages per square mile, 119, and of houses, 108\u00b722; number of persons per occupied house, 4\u00b782.

At that time the neighbouring village of Newar was in possession of a Hindu R\u00e1j\u00e1, who sent a band of men to drive the Muhammadan away, whereupon, according to the local legend, the holy man cursed him so that he and all his people perished, and the town of Newar was annihilated. Its ruins are still to be seen. On Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn's death a shrine was built over his grave, which is still in the possession of his descendants. It was formerly rich and famous, but has now decayed in popular esteem, and has lost great part of the revenues with which it was endowed. Population (1881) 6350, comprising 3659 Hindus and 2691 Muhammadans. Area of town site, 115 acres. The town is reported to be decreasing in population year by year.

It is bounded on the north by the Mah\u00e1nadi river (separating it from the States of Baramb\u00e1 and Tigari\u00e1), on the east by the District of Cuttack, on the south by the District of Puri, and on the west by Khandp\u00e1r\u00e1 State. A small portion of the State lies north of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed.\n\nFrom 1805 to 1840, B\u00e1nk\u00ed paid an annual tribute to the Government of \u00a3443, but in the latter year the State was confiscated, owing to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 having been convicted of murder and sentenced to imprisonment for life. From that time it has been under the direct management of the Bengal Government, being included within the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of Cuttack. Since being taken under British administration, the estate has steadily increased in prosperity. In 1860\u201361, B\u00e1nk\u00ed yielded a revenue of \u00a31333, which ten years later (1870\u201371)\nhad increased to \u00a31996, and at the end of the next decade, in 1880-81, to \u00a33414. The population of the estate, which in 1872 amounted to 49,426, had increased in 1881 to 56,900, namely 28,448 males, and 28,452 females, inhabiting 177 villages, and occupying 9181 houses; density of population, 490'52 per square mile; villages per square mile, 1'53; houses per square mile, 91'88; persons per occupied house, 6'20. Divided according to religion, Hindus number 56,619, or 99'5 per cent. The rest of the population is made up of 270 Muhammadans and 11 Christians. The religious classification by no means coincides with the ethnical division, as aboriginal tribes, numbering 4529 in number, are returned as Hindus by religion. Among the Hindus of undoubted recognised caste are the following:\u2014Br\u00e1hman, 5795; Ch\u00e1s\u00e1, or cultivators, the most numerous caste in the estate, 12,781; Go\u00e1l\u00e1, 4673; Teli, 3628; Keut, 3492; and Khandait, 2191. On a comparison of these figures with those for the Tributary States of Orissa, it will be seen that B\u00e1nk\u00ed is by far the most densely populated of all, and that the proportion of Hindus is much greater, and that of aboriginal tribes less, than in any of the rest. The principal village is B\u00e1nk\u00ed, on the south bank of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed (lat. 20\u00b0 21' 30\" N., long. 85\u00b0 33' 11\" E.). There is a head police station at Ch\u00e1rchik\u00e1, with outposts at B\u00e1ideswar, Kal\u00e1pathar, and Subarnapur. The total police force is 194 strong. B\u00e1nk\u00ed contained in 1872, 2 schools, attended by 116 pupils; and there were in the same year 31 village schools, attendance unknown. The Census of 1881 returned 735 boys as under instruction, and 1181 other males as able to read and write, out of a total male population of 28,448.\n\nB\u00e1nk\u00edpur.\u2014The civil station of Patn\u00e1, and administrative headquarters of Patn\u00e1 District, Bengal. Lat. 25\u00b0 36' 40\" N., long. 85\u00b0 10' 50\" E. Forms a western suburb of Patn\u00e1 city, and is inhabited almost entirely by the European residents of that town. The population is included in the Census returns for Patn\u00e1 city. The houses of the Europeans, and the police lines, judicial courts, and other public buildings, extend for the most part along the old bank of the Ganges. The railway station (East Indian Railway, and Patn\u00e1 and G\u00e1ya State Railway) is in the quarter called M\u00edth\u00e1pur. About a mile from it is the Gold\u00e1, or store-house, of which an account will be found in the article on Patn\u00e1 city. B\u00e1nk\u00edpur has a maid\u00e1n or common, a church, jail, dispensary, racket-court, and billiard-room. There is no trade except in the articles of food, etc., required by the European residents. During the dry weather the stream of the Ganges is about a mile distant, but in the floods there is a backwater which refills the old channel close to the station. The distance of B\u00e1nk\u00edpur from Calcutta by rail is 338 miles. There is a second railway station at Patn\u00e1 city, 6 miles by rail from B\u00e1nk\u00edpur.\nB\u00e1nk\u00edpur.\u2014Ancient village on the H\u00fagl\u00ed river, near the modern Palta above Barrackpur. The name of this village has disappeared from the map, and its site can only be identified from the records of the military transactions in the last century, and from a chart of that period. It formed the principal settlement of the ill-fated Ostend Company in India. The Emperor of Austria, desirous of procuring a share of the East Indian trade, incorporated the Ostend Company in 1722-23, its factors being chiefly persons who had served in the Dutch and English companies. This was the one great effort made by Germany to secure a foothold in India. The Ostend Company, with a capital of twenty millions of livres (less than a million sterling), founded two settlements; one at \u2018Coblom\u2019 (Covelong) between the English Madras and the Dutch Sadras on the south-eastern coast, the other between the English Calcutta and the Dutch Chinsura on the H\u00fagl\u00ed in Bengal. Both of these German settlements were regarded with animosity by the English and the Dutch\u2014an animosity felt also by the French, whose adjacent settlements at Pondicherri on the Madras coast, and Chandannagar on the H\u00fagl\u00ed, were also threatened by the new company. The result was, that in order to obtain the European guarantee for the pragmatic sanction in 1727, the Court of Vienna resolved to sacrifice the Ostend Company. To save its honour, the sacrifice took the form of a suspension of the Company\u2019s charter for seven years. But the Company was practically doomed by the maritime powers of Europe. After a miserable existence it became bankrupt in 1784, and was formally abolished in 1793. Meanwhile, the Dutch and English in Bengal had taken the law into their own hands. In 1733, they stirred up the Muhammadan general (Faujdar) at H\u00fagl\u00ed to pick a quarrel, in the name of the Delhi Emperor, with the little German Settlement at B\u00e1nk\u00edpur, which lay about eight miles below H\u00fagl\u00ed town on the opposite side of the river. The Muhammadan troops besieged B\u00e1nk\u00edpur; and the garrison, consisting of only 14 persons, after a despairing resistance against overwhelming numbers, abandoned the place, and set sail for Europe. The Ostend agent lost his right arm by a cannon ball during the engagement; and the Ostend Company, together with the German interests which it represented, became thenceforth merely a name in Bengal\u2014a name which, as already mentioned, soon disappeared from the maps.\n\nB\u00e1nkomund\u00ed.\u2014Mountain peak in the north of Bod State, Orissa; height, 2080 feet. Lat. 20\u00b0 42\u2032 24\u2033 N., long. 84\u00b0 20\u2032 18\u2033 E.\n\nB\u00e1nkot.\u2014Seaport on the creek of the same name in Ratnagiri District, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 17\u00b0 58\u2032 30\u2033 N., long. 73\u00b0 5\u2032 10\u2033 E. Situated on the Savitri river, 10 miles north-north-west from Savaradrug fort. The channel is on the south-east side of the river entrance, and\nis narrow. The bar, which is about a mile outside of the rocky cliffs, and 2 miles west-south-west of Fort Victoria, has 9 feet at low water, while the rise of the tide is 11 feet at ordinary springs, and 6 or 7 feet at neaps; it is well buoyed.\n\n**Bankura.**\u2014District of the Bardw\u00e1n Division, within the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal, lying between 22\u00b0 40' and 23\u00b0 37' N. lat., and between 86\u00b0 38' and 87\u00b0 47' E. long.; area, 2621 square miles; population, according to the Census of 1881, 1,041,752 souls. The District forms, in shape, an irregular triangle, with its apex to the north. Bounded on the north and east by Bardw\u00e1n District, the D\u00e1modar river marking the boundary for most of the distance; on the south by Midnapur; and on the west by M\u00e1nbh\u00fam. The chief town and administrative head-quarters of the District are at Bankura town.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014Bankura forms the connecting link between the plains of Bengal on the east and the highlands of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur on the west. In the east of the District, where it adjoins Bardw\u00e1n, the scenery presents the ordinary features which characterise the lowlands of Bengal. The country is flat and the land alluvial and well suited for the cultivation of paddy. Proceeding in a westerly or northerly direction, the character of the scenery gradually changes; the land becomes more and more undulating, while patches of jungle and rocky boulders appear, succeeded by forest-crowned hills, which gradually increase in height until they reach an elevation of more than 1400 feet above sea level. Of these hills, the most prominent is Susuni\u00e1 (1442 feet), which forms a prominent feature in the landscape. It was formerly quarried on its southern face by the Bardw\u00e1n Stone Company, but the works have now (1883) been closed. The jungle which covers this hill and the western part of the District generally, is the home of tigers, leopards, small but fierce bears, and many other wild animals, and shelters the cobra and every variety of Indian snake. Here, too, large supplies of lac and *tasar* are obtained, the gathering of which gives occupation to the poorer classes of the people, especially Sant\u00e1s and B\u00e1ur\u00eds. The principal rivers of the District are the Damodar and the Dhalkisor or Dw\u00e1rkeswar, which, although insignificant streams during the hot weather, become navigable in the rains (from the middle of July to the middle of October) by boats of 50 to 60 tons burden. At times, during the rainy season, these rivers rise so suddenly, owing to the flow of rain-water from the neighbouring hills, that a head-wave is formed, called the *hurp\u00e1 b\u00e1n*, not unlike the *bore* or tidal wave in the H\u00fagl\u00ed, which often causes loss of life and great destruction of property. The other streams are the Sil\u00e1i and Kans\u00e1i, which flow through the south-western part of the District, recently added to it from M\u00e1nbh\u00fam. There are no lakes, or canals, or artificial watercourses in the District. Near the town of Bishnupur, and within\nthe old fortifications, are several picturesque tanks, or artificial lakes, constructed by the ancient R\u00e1j\u00e1s, who, taking advantage of natural hollows, threw embankments across them to confine the surface drainage. The mineral products of the District consist of lime, iron, and building stone. The lime produced is obtained from the glutin or nodular limestone, which is found in abundance on the surface of the ground, or a few inches below it. The iron is the produce of the ferruginous laterite with which the District abounds. Very little of it is manufactured, and that only by the Sant\u00e1ls and aboriginal tribes inhabiting the western frontier, for their own wants. Building stone is found in unlimited quantities in the hills and uplands, but the quarries are not now worked. The difficulty and expense of carriage to market is the chief obstacle to the development of these quarries. Although the rich coal-field of R\u00e1niganj is situated just beyond the northern border of the District, no coal has been found within B\u00e1nkur\u00e1, and it is asserted that the existence of coal south of the D\u00e1modar is a geological impossibility. There are no revenue-yielding forests in the District, but several s\u00e1l tracts are kept as jungle, and cut in part either yearly for sale as firewood, or at longer intervals for sale as saplings. Large supplies of lac and tasar silk are obtained from the western jungles, the gathering of which affords occupation to many of the poorer classes, chiefly Sant\u00e1ls and Baur\u00eds. Tigers, leopards, small but fierce bears, hyenas, wolves, deer, and wild hog frequent the jungle tracts along the western boundary; wild elephants also occasionally invade the District from the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s and the Districts of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur on the west. Almost every variety of Indian snake is found in B\u00e1nkur\u00e1, pythons being often met with in the hills. The gokura (cobra), kar\u00e1it, and other deadly serpents are also common.\n\nB\u00e1nkur\u00e1 was formerly situated within the chakl\u00e1 of Bardw\u00e1n, and was with it ceded to the East India Company on the 27th September 1760. For some time after the English obtained the diw\u00e1n\u00ed of the whole province of Bengal, the Bishnupur zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri, as B\u00e1nkur\u00e1 was then called, formed a part of B\u00edrbh\u00fam District, and remained so until 1793, when, by order of the Board of Revenue, it was transferred to Bardw\u00e1n. By Regulation xviii. of 1805, Bishnupur was included in the newly-established Jungle Mah\u00e1ls, and continued to form part of that District until 1833. In 1835\u201336, it was created a separate Collectorate. Numerous changes of boundary, and the old-standing discrepancies between the revenue, judicial, and police jurisdictions, long caused confusion. But in 1872, the transfer to Bardw\u00e1n of pargan\u00e1s Son\u00e1mukhi, Ind\u00e1s, and Kotalpur in the east, and Shergarh and Senpah\u00e1ri in the north, and the addition of Ch\u00e1tn\u00e1 th\u00e1n\u00e1 (from M\u00e1nbh\u00fam) on the west, rendered the jurisdictions almost conterminous. Since then,\na further re-transfer of territories from Bardw\u00e1n has nearly doubled the former area of the District, which in 1872 was returned at 1346 square miles. Its present area is 2621 square miles.\n\n**History.**\u2014The historical interest of the District centres in the town of Bishnupur, which formerly gave its name to the surrounding country. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bishnupur is the descendant of one of the ancient Hindu petty dynasties which formerly held the Bengal frontier against the jungle tribes of the inner plateau on the west. A full account of the family, taken from their native chronicles, will be found in my *Annals of Rural Bengal*.\n\nA long list of kings is recorded, one of whom built tanks and embanked lakes; another raised temples and set up idols; a third encouraged trade; and a fourth spent his time in war. In the beginning of the 11th century we read that \u2018Bishnupur was the most renowned city in the world, and it became more beautiful than the beautified house of Indra in heaven. The buildings were of pure white stone. Within the walls of the palace were theatres, embellished rooms, dwelling-houses, and dressing-rooms. There were also houses for elephants, barracks for soldiers, stables, storehouses, armouries, a treasury, and a temple.\u2019 Three hundred years later the fort was strengthened, the Governor had orders to prepare a new uniform for his army, and so on.\n\nIn later history, the family figures in turn as the enemy, the ally, and the tributary of the Musalm\u00e1n Naw\u00e1bs. It was exempted from personal attendance at the Court of Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d, and appeared by a representative or a Resident at the Darb\u00e1r. During the 18th century, the Bishnupur house declined. Impoverished by Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 raids and Muhammadan extortions, it finally succumbed beneath the famine of 1770, which left the country almost bare of inhabitants. More than one-half of the estate relapsed into jungle, and the family was reduced to such poverty that the R\u00e1j\u00e1 was compelled to pawn his household idol, Madan Mohan (a remnant of aboriginal worship), with one Gokul Chandra Mitra of Calcutta. Some time after, the unfortunate prince with great difficulty managed to collect the amount required to redeem it, and sent his minister to Calcutta to obtain back the pledge. Gokul received the money, but refused to restore the idol. The case was brought before the Supreme Court at Calcutta, and decided in favour of the R\u00e1j\u00e1; whereupon Gokul caused a second idol to be made, exactly resembling the original, and presented it to the R\u00e1j\u00e1. The earlier years of British administration intensified rather than relieved the difficulties of the house of Bishnupur. The R\u00e1j\u00e1s insisted upon maintaining a military array which was no longer required under English rule, and for the support of which their revenues were altogether inadequate. The new system protected them from Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 raids and\nMuhammadan oppressions; but, on the other hand, it sternly put down their own irregular exactions from the peasantry, enforced the punctual payment of the land tax, and realized arrears by sale of the hereditary estates. The Bishnupur family never recovered from the indigence to which they were reduced by the famine of 1770, and their possessions in the District have passed to new and more energetic families. Bishnupur is now in ruins; the palace, with its armouries and theatre and embellished rooms, has disappeared; the interior of the fort is a jungle, in the middle of which lies peacefully an immense roughly-fashioned gun\u201412\u00bd feet in length\u2014the gift, according to native tradition, of a deity to one of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The population of the District in 1872, according to the Census of that year, but allowing for recent transfers, which has increased the area from 1346 to 2621 square miles, was 968,597. The Census of 1881 returned a population of 1,041,752, showing an increase of 73,155 or 7\u00b755 per cent. in the nine years. The male population in 1881 numbered 507,136, and the female 534,616. Area of District, 2621 square miles; average density of population, 397\u00b746 per square mile; number of towns and villages, 5460; villages per square mile, 2\u00b708; number of occupied houses, 168,321, with an average of 6\u00b719 inmates each; unoccupied houses, 14,916. Classified according to religion, the population was returned as follows:\u2014Hindus, 910,845, or 87\u00b744 per cent.; Muhammadans, 46,274, or 4\u00b742 per cent.; Christians, 56; and \u2018others\u2019 (chiefly aboriginal tribes professing various primitive faiths), 84,557, or 8\u00b712 per cent. Among the Hindu population, the high and respectable castes included\u2014Br\u00e1hmans, 84,322; R\u00e1jputs, 13,987; K\u00e1yasths, 20,575; and Baniy\u00e1s, 31,337. The other castes in the District over 10,000 in number were\u2014Sadgop, 45,216; K\u00farmi, 11,810\u2014the two best cultivating castes; Tambuli, 16,091; Napit, 12,262; Gw\u00e1l\u00e1, 59,652; T\u00e1nti, 29,320; Teli, 74,127; Loh\u00e1r, 37,835; Kaibartta, 25,250; Kalu, 21,308; Sunri, 21,350; and the three lowest or semi-aboriginal castes\u2014Bauri, the most numerous in the District, 117,548; Bagdi, 47,146; and Dom, 17,581. Caste-rejecting Hindus numbered 20,397, of whom 20,325 were returned as Vaishnavs. Of aboriginal tribes still professing their ancient faiths, the most numerous were the Sant\u00e1ls, 84,559 in number, besides 20,034 who have accepted Hinduism. The aboriginal tribe of Bhumijs, 18,129, are all returned as Hindus by religion. Of the 46,274 Muhammadans, 44,390 belonged to the Sunni sect. Of the 56 Christians, 15 were Europeans, 11 Eurasians, and 30 Natives of India or Asiatics. The occupations of the male population are returned in the Census in six general classes, as follow:\u2014(1) Professional class, including Government officials and the learned professions, 11,983; (2) domestic servants, hotel and lodging-house keepers, etc., 7652; (3) com-\nmercial class, including merchants, general dealers, carriers, etc., 9874; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 176,438; (5) manufacturing, artisan, mining and other industrial classes, 40,132; (6) indefinite and non-productive class (comprising 54,993 general labourers, 1515 men of rank and property, and 204,549 unspecified, including male children), 261,057. The population is almost entirely rural. There are 3952 villages containing fewer than two hundred inhabitants; 1147 with from two hundred to five hundred; 268 with from five hundred to a thousand; 73 with from one to two thousand; 11 with from two to three thousand; 4 with from three to five thousand; 3 with from five to ten thousand; and 2 with from fifteen to twenty thousand inhabitants. The five towns with a population exceeding five thousand inhabitants, are\u2014B\u00e1nkur\u00e1, 18,747; Bishnupur, 18,863; Patroshair, 7026; Kotalpur, 6163; and Son\u00e1mukh\u00ed, 5590. B\u00e1nkur\u00e1 is a backward District, and the general condition of the people, as compared with the adjoining eastern Districts, is one of poverty. This is especially apparent in the jungle tracts. In the lowland villages, the cultivators are better off; but even here, few show signs of a high standard of comfort, either in personal appearance or in the construction of their houses.\n\nBankura, the chief town and administrative head-quarters of the District, is situated on the north bank of the Dhalkisor river. Bishnupur, farther south, was the ancient capital of the District under its native R\u00e1j\u00e1s. It is described by Colonel Gastrel\u00b9 as having been once strongly fortified \u2018by a long connected line of curtains and bastions measuring 7 miles in length, with small circular ravelins covering many of the curtains. Within this outer line of fortifications, and west of the city, lay the citadel. The remains of these defences still exist. The R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s palace was situated within the citadel. What it may have been in the palmy days of its ancient chieftains it is difficult to say. But at present, a very insignificant pile of brick buildings surrounded by ruins marks the site.\u2019 These ruins, among which are many remains of temples, are of different ages and styles of architecture. The modern city contains the public offices, several schools, and many Hindu and Muhammadan temples. The houses are very poor, although many of the inhabitants are wealthy,\u2014a circumstance which is explained by the statement that the rapacity of former R\u00e1j\u00e1s was so great, that it was dangerous for any one to show signs of wealth; and the custom of building mean dwellings has been handed down from father to son. Of the villages of B\u00e1nkur\u00e1, the following are deserving of mention:\u2014(1) Ond\u00e1, a large village and head-quarters of a police circle containing a subordinate Judge\u2019s Court, and situated near the south bank of the Dhalkisor river, about half way between the towns of B\u00e1nkur\u00e1 and\n\n\u00b9 Statistical and Geographical Report on B\u00e1nkur\u00e1 District.\nBishnupur. (2) Ch\u00e1tn\u00e1, a village and head-quarters of a police circle in the south-west of the District, situated within the tract, recently transferred from M\u00e1nbh\u00fam. (3) Gang\u00e1jalgh\u00e1ti, a considerable village and head-quarters of a police circle, situated in the north-west of the District. (4) Barj\u00f3r\u00e1, a large trading village and police outpost station, a few miles south of the D\u00e1modar in the north-east of the District. (5) R\u00e1jgr\u00e1m, a large trading village near B\u00e1nkur\u00e1 town.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The principal crop in B\u00e1nkur\u00e1, as throughout the rest of Bengal, is rice. The \u00e1man or winter crop is sown in April or May (the ground having been previously four times ploughed), transplanted in July or August, and reaped about December; the \u00e1us or autumn rice is sown broadcast in May, and reaped in September. Among the other crops raised in the District are oil-seeds (mustard, til, and s\u00e1rguj\u00e1), matar (peas), and chhol\u00e1 (gram), cotton, flax, hemp, indigo, sugar-cane, and p\u00e1n. Cotton is gathered in March or April, and indigo generally in July. There are, however, two seasons for sowing indigo, one in February or March, and the other about October. The cultivation of indigo is not increasing, owing partly to the uncertainty of the spring rainfall of late years, and partly to the fact that the soil is not very well suited to this crop. Irrigation is necessary for all kinds of crops in B\u00e1nkur\u00e1, and is effected by means of wells and tanks where natural watercourses and streams are not available; the cost of irrigation varies considerably throughout the District, being for rice land from 9s. to 15s. an acre, and for sugar-cane land from 18s. to \u00a31, 16s. an acre. Manure, consisting of rich black mud scraped from the bottom of tanks or reservoirs and mixed with ashes and stubble, is used for rich fields, and for more valuable crops cow-dung is added; the cost varies from 4s. 6d. to 9s. an acre. On all lands growing sugar-cane and other exhausting staples, rotation is observed, the cane being generally followed by til, after which a crop is taken of \u00e1us or autumn rice, succeeded by mustard (often mixed with peas). Although spare land fit for tillage is scarce in the District, tenures are not unfavourable to the cultivator. As in other parts of Bengal, the land is let and sub-let to a great extent, many middlemen coming between the proprietor and the cultivator. The tenures are generally of the ordinary descriptions, the only one of special interest being 43 gh\u00e1tw\u00e1li estates held subject to payment of a light quit-rent to Government. This quit-rent was originally payable to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bishnupur, on account of service lands held by the gh\u00e1tw\u00e1ls or officers appointed for the defence of certain passes against the inroads of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and others, who made frequent plundering expeditions into the country. The gh\u00e1tw\u00e1li estates were annexed to the regular rent-paying lands at the time of the Decennial Settlement; and on the application of the Bishnupur R\u00e1j\u00e1, who found that he had\nno control over their services, the gh\u00e1tw\u00e1ls were taken over by the Government, the revenue paid by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 to the State being reduced by the amount he had received from them. Spare land fit for tillage is scarce in the District. Tenures, however, are not unfavourable to the cultivators; and that there is a certain quantity of surplus cultivable land is shown by the fact that a class of peasants, known as s\u00e1jids, only hold their lands on a yearly lease, and lead a wandering life from village to village, settling down for the time wherever they can get their temporary holdings on the best terms, and paying their rent in kind. The peasantry are almost invariably in debt, and almost all are tenants-at-will. Very few cases occur of small proprietors who own, occupy, and cultivate their hereditary lands, without either a superior landlord above, or a sub-tenant or labourer below them. A holding exceeding 17 acres in extent is considered an exceptionally large farm, while one below $3\\frac{1}{2}$ acres is exceptionally small. A peasant with a small farm of 5 acres is not so well off as a respectable retail shopkeeper, or a man drawing a pay of Rs. 8, or 16s. a month. Wages and prices have considerably increased in the District of late years. In 1860, the price of the best cleaned rice was 2s. 10\u00bdd. a cwt.: in 1871, it had risen to 4s. 5d.; the price of sugar-cane in 1860 was 8\u00bdd., and in 1871, 1s. 8d. a cwt. The present wage of coolies and agricultural day-labourers is 3d. per diem; formerly they received about half that sum. No marked change has taken place in the rates of rent since the Permanent Settlement; the present rates for rice land are from 6s. to 18s. an acre; for inferior land, 3s. to 12s.; the rates for land suitable for the cultivation of cotton, sugar-cane, and other superior crops are of course higher, \u00a31, 17s. 6d. an acre being given for such land, and \u00a32, 14s. for land yielding two crops.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014The District is subject to drought, occasioned by a deficiency in the rainfall, which is attributed to the indiscriminate clearing of jungle. As there are very few patches of low marshy land in the District which retain moisture for a considerable time, a year of general drought results in serious calamity. Inundations occur every year, owing to the suddenness with which the rivers and streams rise in the rainy season, and the lands bordering on the river suffer accordingly,\u2014so much so that in many places they are permanently allowed to remain waste and uncultivated. Drought in B\u00e1nkur\u00e1 District arises solely from a deficiency in the local rainfall, and not from the failure of the rivers or streams to bring down their usual supply of water. Nothing has been done to guard against the calamity of drought. The famine of 1866, which followed a season of drought, affected B\u00e1nkur\u00e1 principally in the western portion, the tract adjoining B\u00e1rdw\u00e1n not suffering at all seriously. The number of paupers relieved during the months of July, August, September, and October 1866, was 33,216;\nthe total sum placed at the disposal of the Relief Committee was \u00a33044. Four relief dep\u00f4ts were opened. The price of coarse rice rose from 7s. 5d. a cwt. in January, to 18s. 8d. in August, and \u00a31, 1s. 4d. in September. In 1874-75 drought was the occasion of another famine in B\u00e1nkur\u00e1 District. Energetic measures were at once taken on the first appearance of distress; 28 relief centres were established, and a sum of \u00a310,000 was placed at the disposal of the District Relief Committee for gratuitous relief. Roads were constructed to give employment to the able-bodied, and liberal grain and tak\u00e1ri advances were made to the cultivators. Abundant harvests in the two succeeding years soon restored the District to prosperity, and prices of grain speedily returned to their ordinary rates.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The principal manufactures of B\u00e1nkur\u00e1 District are silk and cotton fabrics. Bishnupur town contains a large weaving population, and is noted for the prettily embroidered silk scarfs and fine cloths of silk and cotton there manufactured. Plates, cups, etc., of a kind of soap-stone, are also carved at Bishnupur by the local stone-cutters; the stone, which is brought from M\u00e1nbh\u00fam, is of a grey colour, close-grained and compact, and easily cut. The District manufactures suffice to meet the local demand, and a considerable surplus is left over for exportation to other Districts and to Calcutta. The chief articles of export are rice, oil-seeds, cotton, and silk cloth, silk cocoons, and lac; the imports are English piece-goods, salt, tobacco, spices, etc. The exports are considerably more valuable than the imports, and coin is consequently accumulating in the District. Trade is carried on chiefly by means of permanent markets, and also through the medium of fairs. B\u00e1nkur\u00e1 is well supplied with roads, and the transit of light loads by carts or pack-bullocks is easy in the cold and hot weather, though many of the common cart roads and tracks become impassable during the rains.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The District administrative staff consists of a Collector-Magistrate, Joint-Magistrate, Assistant Magistrate, 3 Deputy Magistrates, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Civil Surgeon, etc. Since B\u00e1nkur\u00e1 was constituted a separate Collectorate in 1835-36, the District revenue has steadily increased. In that year the total revenue amounted to \u00a340,670, and the total civil expenditure to \u00a38006; by 1850-51, the revenue had increased to \u00a350,736, and the civil expenditure to \u00a317,511; in 1860-61, the revenue had further risen to \u00a360,072, and the civil expenditure to \u00a319,426; while in 1870-71, the total District revenue amounted to \u00a369,130, and the civil expenditure to \u00a325,441. During the thirty-five years, therefore, between 1835-36 and 1870-71, the District revenue increased by 72 per cent., and the civil expenditure by 217 per cent. Since the last-mentioned year the District area has undergone considerable change, owing to transfers to Bardw\u00e1n on the\neast, and annexations from M\u00e1nbh\u00fam on the west, which have already been referred to. In 1880-81, the total District revenue amounted to \u00a374,373, of which \u00a345,853 was derived from the land tax. The regular police force consisted in 1880 of 2 superior and 53 subordinate officers, with 208 constables, maintained at a total cost, including all contingencies, of \u00a35486. In addition there was a municipal police force of 7 officers and 127 men, maintained at a total cost of \u00a3875, defrayed by rates levied within municipal limits; and a rural force of village watchmen numbering 8345 men. Each village watchman has charge, on an average, of 30 houses, and receives an average pay in money or lands of \u00a33, 4s. a year. The estimated aggregate cost, both Government and private, of maintaining these several police forces amounted, in 1880, to \u00a333,065, equal to a charge of \u00a312, 12s. 4d. per square mile, or 7\u00bdd. per head of the population. In 1880, the average daily number of prisoners in the B\u00e1nkur\u00e1 jail and Bishnupur subsidiary prison, was 330\u00b734, the total number of prisoners received during the year being 1719. Education is gradually making progress in the District. In 1856-57, the total number of Government and aided schools was 14, with 1354 pupils; in 1872-73, the returns showed 134 Government and 58 private schools, attended by 6425 pupils, costing \u00a32970, of which Government contributed \u00a31103. In 1880, the number of aided and inspected Primary Schools alone was 1186, attended by 29,568 pupils. The Census Report of 1881 returned a total of 30,599 boys as under instruction, and 54,133 other males as able to read and write, out of a total male population of 507,136. Of the female population of 534,616, only 507 girls were reported as under instruction, and 409 other females as able to read and write.\n\nMedical Aspects, etc.\u2014The climate of B\u00e1nkur\u00e1 is oppressive and relaxing in the hot season, but from October to the end of February it is bracing and enjoyable; during the rains the District is not so damp and unhealthy as those farther east. The average annual mean temperature, according to the latest returns, is about 78\u00b760\u00b0 F.; the average rainfall for the 26 years ending 1881 was 56\u00b747 inches. In 1881, the rainfall at B\u00e1nkur\u00e1 town was returned at 73\u00b727 inches, or 16\u00b780 inches above the average. Intermittent fever is common in B\u00e1nkur\u00e1 as in other Districts of Bengal, and is said to have been particularly severe at Bishnupur since the famine of 1866. Leprosy, diarrhoea, and dysentery are also common. Cholera is almost always present in a sporadic form, and sometimes becomes epidemic; outbreaks occurred in 1855, 1860, 1864, and 1866. Small-pox, too, is occasionally epidemic in the District.

Lat. 23\u00b0 14' N., long. 87\u00b0 6' 45\" E. Population (1881) 18,747, consisting of Hindus, 17,829; Muhammadans, 859; and 'others,' 59. Area of town site, 2,400 acres. Municipal income in 1881-82, \u00a3722, of which \u00a3655 was derived from taxation; expenditure, \u00a3741; average incidence of taxation, 8\u00bdd. per head of municipal population. B\u00e1nkur\u00e1 contains, besides the usual public buildings, courts, treasury, post-office, jail, etc., a Government school and a library. The station is dry, and is regarded as very healthy. Considerable trade is carried on, the chief exports being rice, oil-seeds, lac, cotton and silk cloth, silk cocoons, etc., and the principal imports English piece-goods, salt, tobacco, spices, coconuts, and pulses.\n\nBannaw\u00e1s\u00ed.\u2014Town in North K\u00e1nara District, Bombay Presidency. \u2014See BANAVASI.\n\nBannu.\u2014District in the Der\u00e1j\u00e1t Division of the Lieutenant-Governorship of the Punjab, on the north-western or Path\u00e1n frontier, lying between 32\u00b0 10' and 33\u00b0 15' N. lat., and between 70\u00b0 26' and 72\u00b0 E. long. Area 3868 square miles; population (1881) 332,577. Bounded on the north by the Khatak Hills in the British District of Koh\u00e1t; on the east by the British Districts of R\u00e1wal Pindi, Jhelum (Jehlam), and Sh\u00e1hpur; on the west and north-west by hills in the occupation of independent Waz\u00edr\u00ed tribes; and on the south by the District of Der\u00e1 Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n. The civil station and head-quarters of the administration are at the town of EDWARDESABAD, situated near the north-west corner of the District, in lat. 32\u00b0 59' N., long 70\u00b0 38' E.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The Indus, passing through the District from north to south, divides it into two distinct portions. Westwards from the river, after a strip of open plain, the country rises rapidly into a range of hills\u2014the Khatak-Ni\u00e1zai or Maid\u00e1n\u00ed range, a part of the trans-Indus continuation of the Salt Range\u2014in which one peak, that of Sukha Zi\u00e1rat, rises to a height of 4745 feet above the sea level. Beyond lies the valley of Bannu proper, stretching to the frontier hills, an irregular oval, measuring 60 miles from north to south, and about 40 miles from east to west. Girt in by mountains, the valley itself is open and comparatively level, having a soil composed of thick deposits, apparently of lacustrine clay, mingled more or less copiously with sand and pebbles. Towards the south and east, the sand in places completely smothers the sub-soil of clay. Northwards, the country is closely cultivated and thickly dotted with villages, trees, and gardens; while irrigation channels, flowing between grassy banks, impart an air of\nfreshness and prettiness unknown to other frontier Districts. Circling this central oasis, lies a zone of sandy undulating waste (the Thal), strewn here and there with boulders, and scrubby with prickly bushes of camel-thorn. Above it rises a rampart of mountains;\u2014on the west, the independent Waziri Hills, barren and rugged to the eye, but topped by the commanding peaks of Pirghal and Shiwidhar; on the north, the low Khatak Hills of Kohat, above which may be seen, on a clear day, the distant range of the Sufed Koh; on the east, the Khatak-Nizai Hills; and on the south, their continuation in a low range culminating in the limestone rocks of Shekh Budin, 4576 feet above sea level. On the summit of Shekh Budin is a small European station, the sanitarium of Bannu and Dera Ismail Khan, distant from Bannu town 64 miles by road. The hill rises abruptly from the centre of the range. It is for the most part a mass of bare limestone rock, a few stunted wild olives, acacias, and dwarf palms being the sole vegetation. The drawbacks to the place as a sanitarium are its ugliness, the small space available on the summit for building, and its want of springs. The latter defect has, however, been to a certain extent remedied by the construction of masonry tanks. The climate, although salubrious, is not sufficiently bracing for persons whose health requires a radical change of climate. The Bannu valley is drained and fertilized by the Kurram and Tochi (Gambila) rivers, which join a few miles beyond the town of Lakki, and the united stream, after turning the southern end of the Khatak-Nizai Hills, empties itself into a branch stream of the Indus by numerous channels.\n\nThe Indus river pierces the salt range immediately above Kalabagh, on the northern confines of the District, through a narrow channel of its own boring. After passing Kalabagh, the river expands at once into a wide and open bed, and flows placidly on with a fall of about one foot to the mile through the centre of the District in a southerly direction for about 40 miles, till it passes into Dera Ismail Khan District. The country to the west of the Indus has been described above. To the east lies a level plain, a portion of the sandy plain of the Sind Sagar Doab. It is shut in towards the north-east by the Salt Range, which enters the District from that of Shahpur 25 miles due east from the town of Mianwali, and thence runs northwards till it meets the Indus at Mari, opposite Kalabagh. The range is barren and unproductive; and its drainage is carried down in short-lived torrents, which are rapidly swallowed up by the thirsty soil at its base. The sanitarium of the cis-Indus tract is Sakesar (1992 feet), in the extreme east of the District. Only a small portion of the summit of the hill is in Bannu, the remainder being within the boundary of Shahpur District. Sakesar is a charming hill, and unlike Shekh Budin, has abundant space, and generally plenty of water derived from springs.\ntanks, and one well near its summit. It is very grassy, and can boast of a number of small trees and shrubs. The climate resembles that of Shekh Budin, but is not so dry, and is perhaps a trifle cooler. Sakear is the summer head-quarters of the Assistant Commissioner in charge of the Mi\u00e1nw\u00e1li Sub-division. Three main passes by fair roads enter the District from Koh\u00e1t, Mi\u00e1nw\u00e1li, and Der\u00e1 Is-m\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n. Forty other passes lead into the District by rough tracks from independent territory.\n\nNavigation on the Indus is carried on all the year round, but is somewhat dangerous during the rainy season. The river is not fordable at any time of the year, and is not bridged within the limits of the District, although ferries are maintained at five principal crossing places. The boats most commonly in use are flat-bottomed, with high prow and stern, and of from $4\\frac{1}{2}$ to $8\\frac{1}{2}$ tons burthen. The main channel is continually shifting in the wide bed of the river, extending to a maximum width of 13 miles, sometimes being on the Is\u00e1khel side, and sometimes on the Mi\u00e1nw\u00e1li or eastern side. About forty years ago, the great body of the Indus flowed on the Is\u00e1khel side, but sufficiently far from its high western bank to leave a strip of rich alluvial soil, varying from half a mile to two miles in width. By degrees the river encroached on this strip until, shortly after the annexation of the Punjab, the fertile zone was completely submerged. About 1856, a change of course gradually set in the direction of an old channel on the Mi\u00e1nw\u00e1li side, 8 miles east, which it reached in 1864. From 1864 to 1873, the Indus kept hugging its left bank closer and closer, engulfing village after village in its bed, and even undermining its old high bank, and eroding the villages which had crowned it for over a century. Thus, 9 villages, including part of the Civil Station of Mi\u00e1nw\u00e1li, have been partly or wholly destroyed. Since 1873, the river has relaxed its pressure on the left bank, and has taken a central set against villages whose lands had been hitherto left untouched, and were consequently the richest and best in its bed. By 1882, some 25,000 acres of cultivated land had here suffered diluvion. At the same time, some of the channels on the Is\u00e1khel side are again becoming wider, and their volume of water seems to be yearly increasing.\n\nThe trees most commonly found are the shisham (Dalbergia sissoo), mulberry, willow, wild olive, and tamarisk shrubs in the thal. The area under the Forest Department consists of about 3616 acres of shisham, which in 1870\u201371 contained 55,156 trees. There are no lakes or swamps of any importance. Several jhils, which formerly existed, have been partially reclaimed since the annexation of the Province. Two marshes produce thatching reeds.\n\nOf minerals, rock-salt occurs at many spots in the Salt Range proper,\nand in the trans-Indus Maid\u00e1ni range. It is, however, worked, or rather quarried, only at M\u00e1ri, opposite K\u00e1lab\u00e1gh, where the salt stands out in the form of solid cliffs. The out-turn from the M\u00e1ri mine in 1871\u201372 was 77,615 maunds, yielding a revenue of Rs. 23,284. The mines, however, are practically inexhaustible. Saltpetre is produced in small quantities at Is\u00e1khel. It is extracted from the soil by evaporation from water, and afterwards refined by further boiling. Alum, which is abundant through the whole Salt Range, is manufactured at K\u00e1lab\u00e1gh and Kutki, whence it is exported to all parts of Upper India: total out-turn, about 22,000 maunds per annum. Coal of two kinds is found,\u2014oolitic and tertiary; but the smallness of the supply and the expense of quarrying or mining has prevented its extensive use. Petroleum is found in small quantities about eight miles south-east of M\u00e1ri, but the supply is very limited, and hitherto has been only used as an ointment for the cure of itch in camels, or for miners\u2019 lamps. Gold is found in minute quantities in the sands of the Indus, whence it is extracted by a very laborious process of washing.\n\nThe wild animals of the District comprise the m\u00e1rkhor or mountain goat, uri\u00e1l or mountain sheep, ravine deer, hog-deer, wild hog, hy\u00e6nas, wolves, jackals, foxes, and wild cats. Tigers, bears, and leopards are occasionally found, and rewards are paid for their destruction. Partridges, quail, wild duck, teal, geese, snipe, and chikor are common. Mahsir fishing is to be had in the Keoram.\n\nHistory, etc.\u2014The population of Bannu is, and has been for many centuries, essentially Afgh\u00e1n. There are, however, remains which tell of an older Hindu population, and afford proof that the District came within the pale of the ancient Gr\u00e6co-Bactrian civilisation of the Punjab. At Akra and other places in the Bannu valley, mounds of various sizes exist, where, amid fragments of burnt brick and tiles, of broken images and Hindu ornaments, coins occur with Greek or pseudo-Greek inscriptions. Again, at Rokhri, the Indus, which for some years has been encroaching upon the Mi\u00e1nw\u00e1li plain, has on several occasions laid bare masses of stone, which must have been brought from a distance, now embedded at a depth of some 10 or 15 feet below the surface. In 1865, the river retired before it had quite washed away the remains it had exposed, and portions of two circular walls were traced, composed of blocks of stone and large well-burnt bricks plastered, and in places overlaid with thin gold and ornamental scroll-work. Numerous copper coins were also found, and a number of heads and other fragments, apparently cast in some kind of plaster. The well-shaped features and proportions of the broken statues bear the unmistakeable stamp of Grecian art.\n\nThe close of the era of prosperity indicated by these remains is attributed in local tradition to the ravages of Mahm\u00fad of Ghazni, who\nis said to have utterly demolished the ancient Hindu strongholds, leaving no stone standing upon another. For upwards of a century afterwards, the country appears to have lain waste, till at length the Bannu valley was gradually colonized by immigrants from the western hills\u2014the Bannuw\u00e1ls or Bannuch\u00eds, who still remain, and the Ni\u00e1zais, who subsequently gave place to the Marwats. The advent of the Marwats is placed in the reign of Akbar. The Ni\u00e1zais, whom they expelled, spread across the Khatak-Ni\u00e1za\u00ed Hills, and colonized the plain country upon both banks of the Indus. The cis-Indus branch, namely the Sarhang, did not finally obtain their present possessions till 150 years later, when Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Dur\u00e1n\u00ed broke the power of the dominant Ghakkars. The Marwats still hold the southern portion of the Bannu valley.\n\nAt this time, and for two centuries later, the country paid a nominal allegiance to the Delhi Emperors. In 1738 it was conquered by N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h, who completely laid the country waste. Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Dur\u00e1n\u00ed subsequently led his army three or four times through the Bannu valley, levying what he could by way of tribute on each occasion. So stubborn, however, was the opposition of the inhabitants, that neither conqueror made any attempt to establish a permanent government. In 1838 the valley passed by cession to the Sikhs. In the cis-Indus portion of the District, Sikh rule had been already established under Ranj\u00edt Singh, by annexation from the Ghakkars of R\u00e1wal Pindi, who at a still earlier date had suffered defeat at the hands of his father and other Sikh chieftains. Ranjit Singh now lost no time in attempting to occupy his new territory. Elsewhere in the District he had met with little opposition; but in the Bannu valley he was forced, after several efforts, to fall back upon the expedient of his predecessors, and to content himself with the periodical despatch of a force to levy what he was pleased to term \u2018arrears of revenue;\u2019 in reality to devastate the country, and carry off whatever booty could be secured.\n\nSuch was the state of affairs when, after the death of Ranj\u00edt Singh, the District was first brought under British influence. In the winter months of 1847\u201348, Lieutenant (afterwards Sir Herbert) Edwardes was despatched to the frontier as political officer under the Council of Regency at Lahore, accompanied by a Sikh army under General Van Cortlandt. Arrived in Bannu, he found a large portion of the District practically independent. In the Bannu valley every village was a fort, and frequently at war with its neighbours, while the Waz\u00edr\u00ed tribes of the frontier were ever seeking opportunities for aggression. Within a few months, Edwardes reduced the country to order, effecting a peaceful revolution by the force of his personal character, and without the exchange of a single shot. The forts were levelled; arrangements were made for the collection of a regular revenue; and so effectual were his\nmeasures, that on the outbreak of the Mult\u00e1n war he was able to hurry to the scene of action with considerable levies from this District, who served loyally throughout the campaign. The Sikhs in garrison at Edwardes\u00e1b\u00e1d meanwhile rose against their officers, and, having murdered them, marched to join their brethren in arms. A force from the hills at the same time invaded the District, but was held at bay by Lieutenant Rennel Taylor, Edwardes' successor. In the following year, the Punjab was annexed, and the District passed without a blow under British administration. It received its present administrative area in 1861, having up to that time been divided between the Districts of Der\u00e1 Ism\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n and Leiah. The even tenor of administration has been at times disturbed by frontier raids, but no trouble has at any period been given by the inhabitants of the District itself. In the Mutiny of 1857, the country remained perfectly quiet. The border is guarded by a chain of outposts, ten in number. Eight of them are garrisoned by Frontier Militia; but two, namely Kurram and J\u00e1nikhel, have, besides a few mounted militiamen, strong garrisons of regular native troops, who are relieved monthly from Edwardes\u00e1b\u00e1d, where a permanent force is maintained, consisting of one regiment of cavalry, 492 sabres; one battery of artillery having four nine-pounder smooth-bores; and two regiments of infantry, 1,470 bayonets, including men on furlough.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The first Census of the District in 1854 returned the total population at 237,557. The second Census in 1868 showed 284,816 persons living on the area comprising the present District, and allowing for transfers subsequent to 1868. The last Census in 1881, taken over an area of 3868 square miles, disclosed a total population of 332,577 persons, residing in 477 towns or villages, and 57,106 occupied houses. Allowing for difference of area between 1868 and 1881, the population in the latter year showed an increase of 47,761, or 14 per cent. Classified according to religion, the population in 1881 was returned as follows:\u2014Muhammadans, 301,002; Hindus, 30,643; Sikhs, 790; Jains, 60; and Christians, 82, of whom 70 were Europeans and 12 natives. Classified according to sex, there were\u2014males, 177,503; and females, 155,074.\n\nThe Muhammadans outnumber the remaining population of the District in the proportion of nearly ten to one. Foremost among them, both numerically and in respect of political importance, stand the Afgh\u00e1ns or Path\u00e1ns, who by the Census of 1881 numbered 141,022, or 42\u00b740 per cent. of the total population of the District, the most important tribes of which are the Khataks, Waz\u00edris, Loh\u00e1n\u00ed (Marwats, Ni\u00e1zais, and others), and Bann\u00fach\u00eds. The Khataks are found in the Khatak-Ni\u00e1zai range and along the northern border of the District towards Koh\u00e1t. The Waz\u00edris are settlers upon the western frontier, and are only half reclaimed from their mountain life beyond the\nborder, to which, indeed, they return during the hot-weather months. They are a tall and robust people, possessed of many manly virtues, fairly industrious as cultivators, and regular taxpayers. The Marwats, inhabitants of the lower and more sandy portions of the Bannu valley, are one of the noblest races of the North-West Frontier. Path\u00e1ns of pure descent, they are naturally haughty and of a fiery disposition. In person they are tall and muscular; in bearing, frank and open. Almost every officer who has administered the affairs of the District has left on record a favourable mention of them. They are now excellent agriculturists. To these, the Bannuch\u00eds form a painful contrast. They are indubitably of mixed descent, and exhibit every Afghan vice, without possessing the compensating virtues of constancy and self-respect. They are generally small in stature and inferior in physique, sallow and wizened in appearance, and in disposition mean and revengeful. They are, on the other hand, industrious cultivators, and have been uniformly quiet and submissive subjects to the British Government.\n\nOf the remaining Muhammadans, 53,453 are classed in the Census returns under the heading \u2018J\u00e1t,\u2019 a term which here bears no ethnological signification, but includes all of the cultivating Muhammadans who are not either Path\u00e1ns, Sayyids, or Koreshis. There are also 74 Hindus and 373 Sikhs returned as J\u00e1ts. Of 3309 R\u00e1jputs, 2906 are returned as Muhammadans.\n\nHindus number in all 30,643, including 2027 Br\u00e1hmans, 1722 Khattris, and 24,286 Aroras. The last-mentioned are the traders and money-lenders of the District, into which they are said to be comparatively recent immigrants. One family at least of Aroras will be found in every rustic village. A few Br\u00e1hmans also are engaged in trade. The mass of the population is either agricultural or pastoral, and is scattered in small hamlets over the face of the country. The Census returns show 477 towns and villages in the District, of which 163 contain less than 200 inhabitants, and 307 less than 500. These figures, however, do not include hamlets, which are numerous, and have been treated as forming a part of the main village in the revenue-paying area (mauz\u00e1), of which they are treated. Many of these mauz\u00e1s, especially in the cis-Indus tract, are of enormous area, and include a considerable population scattered over numerous small hamlets. The only towns properly so called in the District are\u2014Edwardesabad (Dhul\u00edpnagar), having a population in 1881 of 8960; Laki, 4968; Kalabagh, 6056; and Isakhel, 6692.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014A great part of the District has been brought under cultivation since the introduction of British rule. Some early, and perhaps imperfect, returns give the cultivated area, in 1849, at 265,470 acres. In 1862, the recorded area of cultivation was 432,379 acres.\nIn 1872, the measurements of a regular settlement gave the following results:\u2014Acres cultivated, 579,663; fallow or recently abandoned, 186,521; cultivable but uncultivated, 717,677; barren waste, 954,436.\n\nIn 1878\u201379 (the latest year for which figures are available), the cultivated area was returned at 582,348 acres; cultivable, 723,284 acres; and uncultivable, 1,146,312 acres; total area assessed for Government revenue, 2,451,944 acres, or 3831 square miles, out of a total area of 3868 square miles. In Bannu Proper (the country of the Bannuchis), every cultivable acre is under the plough, and the call upon the soil is incessant. The free use of manure and inundations from the fertilizing Kurram enable the same fields to bear two harvests, year after year,\u2014wheat or barley in the early summer; millets, pulses, cotton, Indian corn, and sugar-cane, with a little rice, in the autumn. The same crops, excepting rice, form the staples of cultivation in all parts of the District. Wheat and barley are sown in October or November, and reaped in April or May; cotton is sown in April or May; millets, pulses, and Indian corn are sown in July and August. The autumn harvest continues throughout November. Next in fertility to the Bannu valley are the lands found in the low-lying bed of the Indus, which in places measures about 14 miles across. But agriculture here is precarious, and depends from year to year upon the caprice of the river when in flood. Villages which have thousands of acres under cultivation one year, will next year often have hundreds only, or none at all. Such land is termed kacha. Its spring crops of wheat and barley are peculiarly fine; but as the low-lying lands become submerged by the summer floods, and high lands are often also eroded, only from 15 to 20 per cent. of the kacha area produces any autumn crop, and that mostly bajra. Beyond the high eastern bank of the Indus there is very little cultivation indeed. The cultivated area may be thus classified in respect of irrigation:\u2014Acres irrigated by cuts from the Kurram and Tochi or Gambila, 99,212; ditto by cuts from the Indus, 11,889; ditto by wells, 1367; subject to inundation from the Indus, 54,511; dependent on the local rainfall, 412,684. The irrigated area in 1878\u201379 (the latest year for which statistics are available) was returned at 155,552 acres, of which 34,552 were irrigated by Government, and 121,000 by private works. The acreage under the principal crops in 1882\u201383 was returned as follows:\u2014Rice, 999 acres; wheat, 269,932; millets, Sorghum vulgare (joar), 9088, and Panicum spicatum (bajra), 134,261; maize, 27,391; barley, 46,236; gram, 69,875; other pulses, 9793; cotton, 8293; sugar-cane, 4329; oil-seeds, 938; drugs and spices, 473; and vegetables, 559 acres. The agricultural stock in the District in 1879 is approximately returned as under:\u2014Cows and bullocks, 127,609; horses, 2620; ponies, 481; donkeys, 18,478; sheep and goats, 71,744;\ncamels, 7341; ploughs, 39,936. The average out-turn per acre of the principal crops in 1882-83 was\u2014rice, 262 lbs.; wheat, 658 lbs.; gram, 450 lbs.; and inferior grains, 672 lbs.\n\nLand Tenures, Wages, Prices, etc.\u2014The village tenures of this District, as a rule, present few features of peculiarity, and fall naturally under the standard communal types recognised throughout the Province. An exception, however, exists in the custom, once general, and still surviving in 13 Marwat villages, of the periodical re-distribution of holdings among the shareholders. This custom is called the khula vesh. It has received official sanction at the recent revenue settlement. Cultivation is chiefly carried on by peasant proprietors, and money rents between tenant and landlord are rare. There are no large proprietors, and the land is minutely sub-divided. All cultivators who assist the proprietors of the soil in clearing waste lands are generally held to have occupancy rights in their holdings. Such tenants surrender a small proportion of their produce as a recognition of the proprietor's right, or pay him a trifling percentage on the Government revenue assessed upon their holdings. Ordinary tenants pay rent in kind, at rates which range from one-half to three-fourths of the gross produce of their fields. These rates are reported to have undergone no material change since 1849. Extra hands taken on at harvest time are paid in kind, at customary rates. Other labour has more than doubled in value since annexation. In the early years of British rule, unskilled labour could be always hired for 2 ann\u00e1s or 3d. per day, sometimes for even less. The rates in 1880 ranged from 2 ann\u00e1s or 3d. up to 5 ann\u00e1s or 7\u00bdd. per day for unskilled, and from 6 ann\u00e1s or 9d. to 10 ann\u00e1s or 1s. 3d. for skilled labour. The official returns for 1876 give the price of some principal items of local consumption, as they stood upon January 1st of that year, as follows:\u2014Wheat, 39\u00bd sers per rupee, or 2s. 10\u00bdd. per cwt.; barley, 62\u00bd sers; gram, 46\u00bc sers; millets (Sorghum vulgare), 60 sers; and (Panicum spicatum) 55 sers. These prices show a very considerable fall below those of 1866, when wheat stood at 15 sers per rupee; barley, 23\u00bd sers; gram, 22 sers; millets (Sorghum vulgare), 22 sers; and (Panicum spicatum) 17 sers. On the 1st January 1882, prices again ranged high, as follows:\u2014Wheat, 19\u00beth sers per rupee; barley, 38\u00be; gram, 32\u00bd sers; Sorghum vulgare, 27\u00bd sers; and Panicum spicatum, 24\u00bd sers. The scarcity of 1868-69 was not felt in Bannu.\n\nCommerce and Trade, Communications, etc.\u2014The District has but little export trade. Alum, manufactured at K\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1gh, and also at Kutki in the Khatak-Ni\u00e1zai Hills, is exported in small quantities. Salt is quarried from the right bank of the Indus, about 2 miles above K\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1gh, and conveyed across the river to M\u00e1ri, one of the Government salt marts of the Sh\u00e1hpur Customs District. Considerable quantities of grain\nare sent down the river, to find a market at Der\u00e1 Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n or Sukkur (Sakkar). The average export of grain is over 500,000 maunds (or about 18,300 tons), of which about 350,000 maunds (or about 12,650 tons) consist of wheat. Sugar, piece-goods, silk, indigo, drugs, ghi, oil, iron, mats, and tobacco are imported. The exports in an average year are estimated at \u00a3119,555, and the imports at \u00a3138,249 in value. The local seats of commerce are Dhulipnagar, the b\u00e1z\u00e1r of Edwardes\u00e1b\u00e1d, Is\u00e1khel, K\u00e1lab\u00e1gh, Mi\u00e1nw\u00e1li, and Laki, the principal village of the Marwat country. In all foreign and many home transactions, the river forms the highway of traffic. The District is badly provided with roads. Edwardes\u00e1b\u00e1d lies upon the military frontier road, which connects it with Koh\u00e1t and Pesh\u00e1war on the one hand, and with Der\u00e1 Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n and Der\u00e1 Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n upon the other. Another road, passing Is\u00e1khel and Mi\u00e1nw\u00e1li, connects it with Sh\u00e1hpur, whence roads diverge to different parts. These are the only made roads of the District, and none of them are metalled. There are altogether 797 miles of unmetalled roads in the District. Communication is frequently cut off for days during the rainy season by floods, either of the Indus or of the Kurram and Gamb\u00edla. Neither of the last-mentioned streams is navigable.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The revenue derived from the District, after the exclusion of purely local items, amounts to about \u00a347,500, of which about \u00a342,000 is the produce of the land tax. This has been (summarily) assessed twice since the annexation of the District; and a third (regular) assessment was completed in 1879. The first assessment, effected in 1849, fixed the demand on account of land revenue at \u00a336,995; the second, effected at different times between the years 1846 and 1861, enhanced the demand to \u00a340,718. In the year 1875\u201376, the collections of land revenue, together with certain items of a fluctuating nature classed with it, amounted to \u00a342,385, or about 1s. 1\u00bdd. (8 ann\u00e1s 10 pies) per acre of land cultivated or fallow. The gross revenue for the same year amounted to \u00a347,007. In 1881\u201382, the land revenue was returned at \u00a334,603, and the gross revenue at \u00a353,785. The annual cost of the collection of the land revenue amounts to about \u00a32500.\n\nThe number of civil and revenue judges of all ranks in the District in 1881\u201382 was 10, including a Deputy-Commissioner and four Assistant or extra-Assistant Commissioners. One of the latter is always stationed at Mi\u00e1nw\u00e1li, east of the Indus. The magisterial courts were 10 in number. The police force of the District numbered 465 men in 1881, being 1 to every 716 inhabitants. The returns of crime are high. There is a small jail at Edwardes\u00e1b\u00e1d, in which the daily average number of prisoners during 1881 was 143. In 1881, Bannu contained 27 schools attended by 1252 pupils. A Church\nMission School at Edwardes\u00e1b\u00e1d also receives a grant in aid. The following towns are municipalities constituted under Act iv. of 1873: \u2014Edwardes\u00e1b\u00e1d, Laki, Is\u00e1khel, and K\u00e1lab\u00e1gh. The aggregate population within municipal limits is 25,776, and the aggregate municipal income for the year 1881-82 amounted to \u00a33637, or 2s. 9\u00bdd. per head.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate is marked by the usual Punjab characteristics of extreme heat during the summer months, and considerable cold during the winter. No record of temperature is kept. The Edwardes\u00e1b\u00e1d cantonment, and the irrigated portion of the Bannu valley generally, are extremely unhealthy, intermittent and remittent fevers being especially prevalent. Disease of the spleen is also very common among the Bannuch\u00eds. The rainy months are those of July and August. The Meteorological Report returns the average annual rainfall for the twenty years ending 1881 at 13'42 inches. The total rainfall in 1881 was 11'9 inches. The death-rate seems to be highest in November and December. [For further information regarding Bannu District, see the Punjab Gazetteer (Lahore 1884), the Punjab Census Report for 1881, and the Provincial Administration Reports for 1880 to 1882.]\n\nBannu.\u2014Tahsil of Bannu District, Punjab, forming the northern portion of the circular basin drained by the rivers Kurram and Tochi or Gambila, and enclosed on three sides by lofty mountains. Lat. 32\u00b0 44' 30\" to 33\u00b0 5' 45\" N., long. 70\u00b0 24' 30\" to 71\u00b0 0' 30\" E. Inhabited by a mongrel Afgh\u00e1n tribe known as Bannuch\u00eds.

These officers preside over 7 civil and revenue and 6 criminal courts. Number of police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 4; strength of regular police, 111 men; of village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 200.\n\nBannu (or Edwardes\u00e1b\u00e1d).\u2014Head-quarters of Bannu District, Punjab.\u2014See EDWARDESABAD.\n\nBanp\u00e1s.\u2014Village in the head-quarters Sub-division of Bardw\u00e1n District, Bengal. Population (1881) 3662. Noted for its manufacture of brass and bell-metal ware, and cutlery.\n\nB\u00e1npur.\u2014Estate or zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri in B\u00farh\u00e1 tahsil, B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t District, Central Provinces.\u2014See BHANPUR.\n\nB\u00e1nsa.\u2014Town in Hardoi District, Oudh; 6 miles north-east of Mall\u00e1nw\u00e1n. Population (1881) 2304, living in 292 houses. A thriving village held by Kanaujia K\u00farmis for upwards of seven centuries, to\nthe ancestors of whom the site was awarded for loyal services by the Hindu R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kanauj. School.\n\n**Bansa.**\u2014Village in Damoh tahsil, Damoh District, Central Provinces; situated about 15 miles west of Damoh town. Population (1881) 2314, namely, Hindus, 2373; Kab\u00edrpanthi, 1; Muhammadans, 85; and aboriginal tribes, 55. Village school and police station. Manufacture of coarse cloth.\n\n**B\u00e1nsb\u00e1ri\u00e1** (or B\u00e1nsb\u00e1ti, \u2018The Place of Bamboos\u2019).\u2014Town on the H\u00fagl\u00ed river, in H\u00fagl\u00ed District, Bengal; 29 miles north of Calcutta. Lat. 22\u00b0 57' 30\" N., long. 88\u00b0 26' 30\" E.; population (1881) 7031, comprising 6371 Hindus and 660 Muhammadans; municipal income in 1882, \u00a3364. There is a famous temple with 13 pinnacles, and as many images of Siva, dedicated to the goddess Hanseswari. It was built by R\u00e1n\u00ed Sankari D\u00e1si, the wife of a zamind\u00e1r of the place, at a cost of a lakh of rupees (\u00a310,000), and was formerly protected by an armed fort, armed with four cannon and surrounded by a trench, as a defence against the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. The temple occupies 15 acres of ground. There were formerly 12 or 14 tols, or Sanskrit schools (see Nadiya District) at B\u00e1nsb\u00e1ri\u00e1, but Sanskrit studies are now on the decline. Here, too, the first native Christian church under a native minister in this part of the country was formed, the pastor being an educated native named T\u00e1r\u00e1ch\u00e1nd, who spoke English, French, and Portuguese with fluency.\n\n**B\u00e1nsd\u00e1** (W\u00e1nsd\u00e1).\u2014Native State within the Political Agency of Surat, in the Province of Guzer\u00e1t, Bombay Presidency, lying between 20\u00b0 42' and 20\u00b0 56' N. lat., and between 73\u00b0 18' and 73\u00b0 34' E. long.; bounded west by Surat District, north by the State of Baroda, east by the D\u00e1ng States, and south by the State of Dharampur; estimated area, 384 square miles; population (1881) 34,122; estimated gross revenue, \u00a316,861; expenditure, \u00a314,966, of which \u00a32682 was spent on public works. There are 87 villages in the State. With the exception of a few villages bordering on the District of Surat, almost the whole country is covered with forest, the surface in some places being level and in others rising into rocks and small hills. The climate is unhealthy, fevers and other diseases prevailing throughout the year. There are some tracts of black soil, but over the greater part of the State the soil is light-coloured. Products\u2014rice, gram, and pulse; manufactures\u2014cotton tape, mats, fans, baskets, and coarse woollen carpets and cloth. The family of the chief are Hindus of R\u00e1jput extraction, claiming descent from the Solanki race of princes. The ruins of the fortified enclosure near B\u00e1nsd\u00e1, and of several temples and works of irrigation, point to a former period of prosperity. At one time the chiefs probably had possessions extending to the sea-coast; but by the advance of the Musalm\u00e1ns they were gradually driven to seek refuge\nin the more thickly-wooded parts of their dominions. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s seem to have been the first to bring the chiefs entirely into subjection and impose a tribute upon them. The right of levying this tribute was transferred by the Peshw\u00e1 to the British by the treaty of Bassein (1802). The State now pays to the British Government a yearly tribute of \u00a315. In 1856 an arrangement was entered into with the State for the payment annually of \u00a3150, in consideration of the British Government foregoing its share in transit duties, the State binding itself to limit its customs and transit duties to certain sanctioned rates.\n\nThe chief, who bears the title of R\u00e1j\u00e1, maintains a military force of 150 men, with 2 field and 12 other guns. He is entitled to a salute of 9 guns, and has power to try his own subjects for capital offences without the express permission of the Political Agent. The family follows the rule of primogeniture, and has received a sanad, or patent, authorizing adoption. In consequence of the death of the chief in February 1876, the State is administered by an officer of the British Government during the minority of his son. In 1883, the young chief was associated with the British joint administrator, in order to prepare him at as early a date as possible for investiture with full powers. There are 9 boys' schools and 1 girls' school in the State, with an average daily attendance of 414. At Un\u00e1i, within the limits of this State, and 7 miles from B\u00e1nsd\u00e1, is a hot spring, the temperature of which is generally but little below boiling point; but once a year, at the time of the March full moon, the heat abates sufficiently to allow a company of pilgrims and devotees to bathe in it. The fair at this period is attended by some six or seven thousand people, and lasts for six days.\n\nB\u00e1nsd\u00e1.\u2014Chief town of the State of the same name in Guzerat, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 20\u00b0 47' 30\" N., long. 73\u00b0 28' E.; population (1881) 2447. Dispensary, school, and post-office.\n\nBansdih.\u2014Tahsil, or Sub-division of Ballia District, North-Western Provinces, created in 1882 from parts of Rasra and Ballia tahsils. It lies along the south or right bank of the Gogra (Gh\u00e1gra), and is much intersected by side channels from that river. A considerable portion of the tahsil is yearly flooded in the rainy season. Area, 374 square miles, of which 258 are cultivated. Population (1881) 287,352, or an average of 768 to the square mile. Land revenue (including cesses) \u00a321,338; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a352,608. In civil matters, the tahsil is included within the jurisdiction of the munsif of R\u00e1sra. It contains 1 criminal court, with 3 police stations (th\u00e1nd\u00e1s); strength of regular police, 55 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 433.\n\nBansdih.\u2014Town in Ballia District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of Bansdih tahsil. Lat. 25\u00b0 52' 38\" N., long. 84\u00b0 15' 30\" E. Situated on a level alluvial plain, 2 miles north-west of the Sur\u00e1h\u00e1\nLake, and 8 miles south of the Gogra (Gh\u00e1gra). Population (1881) 9617, namely, 9007 Hindus and 610 Muhammadans. A small municipal revenue for police and conservancy purposes is raised under the provisions of the Chauk\u00edd\u00e1ri Act (xx. of 1856). Tahs\u00edl; police station.\n\nB\u00e1nsg\u00e1on.\u2014Tahs\u00edl or Sub-division of Gorakhpur District, North-Western Provinces, lying between the R\u00e1pti and the Gogra (Gh\u00e1gra). Area, 616 square miles, of which 398 are cultivated; population (1881) 422,858; land revenue, \u00a323,113; total revenue, \u00a326,071; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a372,792. The tahs\u00edl contains 1 civil and 1 criminal court, with 6 police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s): strength of regular police, 81 men; village watchmen (chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs), 580.\n\nB\u00e1nsg\u00e1on.\u2014Town in Gorakhpur District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of B\u00e1nsg\u00e1on tahs\u00edl, 19 miles south of Gorakhpur town. Population in 1872, 3069; in 1881, 5873, namely, 5384 Hindus, 485 Muhammadans, and 4 \u2018others.\u2019 The town or village is composed of 10 hamlets, the land around being held by a number of proprietors, some of whose holdings are so small as to be barely sufficient to support existence. Owing probably to the nearness of Gorakhpur town, into which the villagers carry their grain for sale, there is little local trade. A weekly market is held every Friday, and an annual fair in September\u2013October. Tahs\u00edl, police station, post-office, Government school, and rest-house (dharm\u015b\u012bla). Two Hindu temples, and one mosque.\n\nB\u00e1nsg\u00e1on.\u2014Agricultural village in Gorakhpur District, North-Western Provinces, situated 64 miles by road east of Gorakhpur town. Said to have been founded by Bhu\u00ednh\u00e1rs from the south, and still containing many Bhu\u00ednh\u00e1r inhabitants. Village school.\n\nB\u00e1nsg\u00e1on.\u2014Town in Purniah District, Bengal. Population (1881) 6158, namely, Muhammadans, 3413, and Hindus, 2745. Area of town site, 8613 acres.\n\nBansi.\u2014Village in Udaipur State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Chief place of an estate of the same name, and the residence of a first-class noble of the State, who owns 56 villages.\n\nB\u00e1nsi.\u2014Tahs\u00edl of Basti District, North-Western Provinces, lying along the river R\u00e1pti on the Nepal border. Area, 609 square miles, of which 426 are cultivated: population (1881) 338,839; land revenue, \u00a324,376; total revenue, \u00a324,989. The tahs\u00edl contains 1 civil and 1 criminal court, with 6 police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s); strength of regular police, 64 men; village watchmen (chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs), 440.\n\nB\u00e1nsi.\u2014Town in Gorakhpur District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of B\u00e1nsi tahs\u00edl, situated on the right or south bank of the R\u00e1pti, 32 miles north-north-east of B\u00e1nsi town. Population under five thousand. The place is rather an overgrown village than a town,\nconsisting of a mass of mud huts, dotted here and there with a temple, a mosque, or the brick-built house of some grain merchant. The local R\u00e1j\u00e1 resides at Narkatha, on the opposite side of the river. The B\u00e1ns\u00ed R\u00e1j\u00e1s formerly resided in B\u00e1nsi itself, and the remains of their castle occupy a high site in the south-east corner of the town. In the midst of the ruins rises a great fig-tree (the supposed abode of a demon, the ghost of a Br\u00e1hman, who did a former R\u00e1j\u00e1 to death, and drove the family from their ancestral residence) which is now an object of worship. Two weekly fairs are held. Several unmetalled roads from Nep\u00e1l, Basti, Domari\u00e1ganj, Bankala, and elsewhere, converge upon the town; and the R\u00e1pti is crossed by a ferry. During the last thirty years, the prosperity of B\u00e1nsi, which was formerly a considerable entrep\u00f4t for grain, has declined, although a fair local business is still carried on at the weekly markets. About a hundred yards north-east of the town stands the small and fort-like tahs\u00edl. The other public buildings consist of a first-class police station, munsif\u2019s court, post-office, Government school, s\u00e1rdi or native inn, staging bungalow, and branch dispensary. The water supply of the town is very bad, and the inhabitants suffer much from goitre.\n\nB\u00e1nskh\u00e1l\u00ed.\u2014Village in Chittagong District, Bengal, with small export trade in rice. Lat. $22^\\circ 50' 15''$ N., long. $91^\\circ 31'$ E. The place gives its name to a police circle (th\u00e1n\u00e1), and also to a small canal and an embankment.\n\nB\u00e1nsloi.\u2014Tributary of the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed river, Bengal, rising in the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s, and flowing a generally eastern course through B\u00edrbh\u00fam and Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d Districts till it falls into the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed opposite the large commercial town of Jangipur. Navigable during the rainy season by boats of 2 tons burden. As its name implies, it was largely utilised for floating down rafts of bamboos, till the neighbouring hills became almost denuded.\n\nB\u00e1nsror.\u2014Fort in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na.\u2014See BHAINSROR.\n\nB\u00e1nsura.\u2014Town in Sit\u00e1pur District, Oudh, on the right bank of the Chauk\u00e1 river; 39 miles from Sit\u00e1pur town. Population (1881) 2293. Government opium warehouse, school, tri-weekly market.\n\nB\u00e1nsw\u00e1r\u00e1 (Wasnw\u00e1r\u00e1).\u2014State in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, under the Mew\u00e1r Political Agency, bounded on the north and north-west by Dungarpur and Meyw\u00e1r, on the north-east and east by Part\u00e1bgarh, on the south by petty States of the Central India Agency, and on the west by the Rew\u00e1-K\u00e1ntha States of the Bombay Presidency; between $23^\\circ 10'$ and $23^\\circ 48'$ N. lat., and between $74^\\circ 2'$ and $74^\\circ 41'$ E. long. Length from north to south, about 45 miles; and breadth from east to west, about 33 miles; area, about 1300 square miles. On the north and east the boundary is marked by the M\u00e1hi river. The western portion of the State is open and well cultivated, and its inhabitants are chiefly a settled population of\nBrahmans of the cultivating classes; the roads here are in fair order and practicable for carts during the greater part of the year. The remainder of the country is covered with rugged hills, rocks, scrub-jungle and woodland, and is inhabited by Bhils. Water is tolerably plentiful throughout the State; in the Bhil tracts there is often a scarcity in the summer, and during the rains travelling is difficult, unless an elephant is used. Of the geology of Banswara scarcely anything is known, and its mineral productions are unimportant. The Mahi is the principal river of the State; its banks are between 40 and 50 feet high, and except in the rainy season it is always fordable. The average rainfall is 44.3 inches per annum, and the temperature in summer 92\u00b0 to 100\u00b0 F.; rains, 80\u00b0 to 83\u00b0; winter, 65\u00b0 to 70\u00b0. Fever is the most formidable and prevalent malady. The chiefs of Banswara belong to the Sesodia clan of Rajputs now ruling in Dungarpur, of which they are a junior branch. In the 16th century the whole country which now comprises the two States of Dungarpur and Banswara was under the dominion of one family of Sesodias. On the death of one of the chiefs, Udai Singh, in 1528, the territory was divided between his two sons, and the descendants of the two families are the present chiefs of Dungarpur and Banswara, the river Mahi being fixed as the boundary between the two States. Since that time they have remained distinct and independent of one another. Towards the end of the 18th century, Banswara became more or less subjected to the Marathas; it paid tribute to the Chief of Dhar in Central India. In 1812, the chief offered to become tributary to the British Government on the condition of the expulsion of the Marathas; but no definite relations were formed with him till 1818, when a treaty was concluded, by which the chief bound himself to act in subordinate co-operation, and to settle his affairs in accordance with the advice of the British Government, to abstain from disputes and political correspondence with other chiefs, to pay a tribute (not exceeding three-eighths of his revenue), and to furnish troops when required. The tribute was fixed at \u00a32625, but it has since been raised to \u00a33800 to defray the cost of additional supervision required by the disorders of the native administration, and for works of utility to the State.\n\nThe chief holds the rank of Maharawal, and is entitled to a salute of 15 guns. He has received the right of adoption. The chief feudatory of the State is the Rao of Kushalgarh, who holds a compact domain in the south of Banswara; there are besides 13 thakurs of the first rank in the State, who pay a total tribute of \u00a31612 to their chief. The revenue of Banswara is about \u00a328,000, of which 33 feudatories enjoy about \u00a37333. The population has been returned (1881) at 152,045, of whom the Bhils form more than one-third, while the inhabitants of the chief towns are mostly Hindus of the\ntrading classes, Mus\u00e1lmans and R\u00e1jputs. The system of administration is generally of a primitive sort. Education is at a low ebb, and there are no made roads in the State, nor traffic routes of any importance, most of the traffic from Ratlam and M\u00e1lw\u00e1 passing south through Kushalg\u00e1rh. The chief keeps a military force of 3 guns with 20 gunners, 60 cavalry and 500 infantry. The State is divided into the following 8 Districts, viz. Ghanti-Ut\u00e1r, Lo\u00e1ria, Chimda, Bhungra, Mah\u00edr\u00e1w\u00e1ra, Panchalw\u00e1ra, Kh\u00e1nduw\u00e1ra, and Pathog. In this article the revenue, etc. has been calculated into British rupees from the local Salim Sh\u00e1h currency, which is worth about one-third less than the standard rupee.\n\n**B\u00e1nsw\u00e1ra.**\u2014Capital of the State of that name, in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Lat. 23\u00b0 30' N., long. 74\u00b0 24' E. Population (1881) 7908. The chief's palace stands on rising ground to the south of the city, and is surrounded by a high loopholed wall with three gates. On the crest of the low ridge to the south of the capital stands a double-storied building called the Sh\u00e1hi Bel\u00e1s, built by the present chief. To the east lies the B\u00e1\u00ed T\u00e1l, or 'Lady's Lake,' and in a garden about half a mile distant are the chh\u00e1tris or mausoleums of the rulers of B\u00e1nsw\u00e1ra. Some old ruins on the top of a hill two miles to the south of the city, are said to be the remains of the palace of the chief who founded it. The town has a wall round it, which, except on the south, is in a tolerable state of repair. Dispensary and post-office. A fair, lasting 15 days, and attended by about 2000 visitors, takes place in October.\n\n**Banthar.**\u2014Town in Un\u00e1o District, Oudh; 5 miles south of Un\u00e1o town, on the road from Purwa to Cawnpur. Population (1881) 2235, namely, Hindus, 2153, and Muhammadans, 82; 6 Hindu temples; vernacular school.\n\n**Banthly (IVanthl\u00ed, Vanathali).**\u2014Town in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 21\u00b0 28' 30\" N., long. 70\u00b0 22' 15\" E.; population (1881) 6529.\u2014See WANTHLI.\n\n**B\u00e1ntw\u00e1.**\u2014Native State within the Sorath District of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, in the Province of Guzerat (Gujarat), Bombay Presidency, lying between 21\u00b0 24' and 21\u00b0 39' N. lat., and between 70\u00b0 0' 15'' and 70\u00b0 18' 45'' E. long.; estimated area, 221 square miles; population (1881) 38,536; gross revenue, \u00a345,000. The country is for the most part a plain of rich black soil, watered towards the south by the Bh\u00e1dar and Ojhat rivers. The climate is on the whole good; the average rainfall is about 25 inches. The chief diseases are fever and dysentery. Besides the usual grains, much cotton is grown, and a considerable quantity of sugar-cane. There is a local manufacture of coarse cotton cloth.\n\nThe ruling family is Musalm\u00e1n, descended from a younger son of the second Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1gahr, to whom the B\u00e1ntw\u00e1 territory was made over in 1740. Engagements to keep order and remain at peace\nwere entered into with the British Government in 1807. The present chief, with the title of B\u00e1bi, resides at M\u00e1n\u00e1adar, and maintains a military force of 171 men. He has no sanad authorizing adoption, nor does the succession follow the rule of primogeniture. The chief pays to the British Government an annual tribute of \u00a32964, inclusive of \u00a31482 for M\u00e1n\u00e1nadar. There are two other shareholders of this State, both holding the title of B\u00e1bi, one of whom resides at G\u00edd\u00e1r. The State is without made roads; the produce of the country finds its way outwards chiefly through the harbours of Ver\u00e1wal, M\u00e1ngrol, and Porbandar. There is 1 school, with 57 pupils. No transit dues are levied.\n\n**B\u00e1ntw\u00e1.**\u2014Chief town of the State of the same name, in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Province of Guzer\u00e1t, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 21\u00b0 29' 15\" N., and long. 70\u00b0 7' E.; population (1881) 7589, namely, 1558 Hindus, 6016 Muhammadans, and 15 Jains. The town is fortified.\n\n**B\u00e1ntw\u00e1l.**\u2014Town in South K\u00e1nara District, Madras Presidency, containing about 1000 houses, chiefly occupied by traders. Lat. 12\u00b0 53' 20\" N., long. 75\u00b0 4' 50\" E. Population (1881) 3090, namely, 2228 Hindus, 760 Muhammadans, 87 Christians, and 15 others. Situated on the river N\u00e9trovati, 14 miles east of Mangalore. The river bed is here encumbered with masses of hornblende rock, containing mica and garnets, syenite and a beautiful pegmatite, with flesh-coloured crystals of felspar. Formerly a place of importance, and still, as an entrep\u00f4t for the produce of the District on its way to Mysore, possessing a considerable through traffic. During the war with Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n the town was partially destroyed by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Coorg, who also carried off half the inhabitants as prisoners. The former t\u00e1luk of B\u00e1ntw\u00e1l extended over 1650 square miles, and was divided into 88 m\u00e1ganis, containing 394 villages and 8449 estates, paying a total revenue of \u00a325,000 per annum. It was dismembered in 1852, and merged in the other t\u00e1luks now existing.\n\n**Ban\u00far.**\u2014Town in Pinjaur tahs\u00edl, Pati\u00e1l\u00e1 State, Punjab. Population (1881) 6671, namely, Hindus, 3239; Sikhs, 957; Jains, 67; and Muhammadans, 2408. Number of occupied houses, 1478.\n\n**Baoli.**\u2014Town in Meerut (Merath) District, North-Western Provinces. Population (1881) 5990, namely, Hindus, 5321; Muhammadans, 443; and Jains, 226; area of town site, 49 acres.\n\n**Baoni.**\u2014State in Bundelkhand, enclosed on all sides by British territory, lying between 25\u00b0 53' 15\" and 26\u00b0 7' N. lat., and between 79\u00b0 42' 30\" and 80\u00b0 30' 25\" E. long.; length, north to south, about 15 miles; area, 127 square miles; population in 1881, 17,055; estimated revenue, \u00a310,000. This is the only Muhammadan State in Bundelkhand. The Chief, Naw\u00e1b Gh\u00e1zi-ud-din Kh\u00e1n, has a military force of 40 cavalry, 300 infantry, and 75 police, 3 guns, and 8 gunners. The grant of 52\nvillages was originally made about the middle of the last century to Gh\u00e1zi-ud-d\u00edn Kh\u00e1n, a connection of the Niz\u00e1m's family, by the Peshw\u00e1. This grant was confirmed by the British Government in 1802; and the Muhammadan descendant of the original grantee still holds the j\u00e1g\u00edr, and resides at Kodaner, his chief village.\n\n**B\u00e1ori.**\u2014State in Central India. *See Kali B\u00e1ori.*\n\n**B\u00e1patl\u00e1.**\u2014T\u00e1luk in Kistna District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 15\u00b0 54' N., long. 80\u00b0 31' E. Area, 679 square miles; land revenue, \u00a359,040. Houses, 26,674; population (1881) 151,736, being 76,574 males and 75,162 females, distributed in 2 towns and 112 villages. Chief town, B\u00e1patl\u00e1.\n\n**B\u00e1patl\u00e1.**\u2014Town in Kistna District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 15\u00b0 54' 30\" N., long. 80\u00b0 30' 25\" E.; population (1881) 6086, namely, 5689 Hindus, 396 Muhammadans, and 1 Christian, occupying 1080 houses. Situated about 30 miles south of Gantur (Guntoor). Headquarters of the t\u00e1luk of the same name, with a District munsif's court, post-office, and travellers' bungalow.\n\n**B\u00e1r\u00e1.**\u2014River in Pesh\u00e1war District, Punjab. It rises in a valley of the same name, lying in native territory on the southern side of the Khaibar Hills; receives its chief tributary, the T\u00edra Toi, 8 miles beyond the British border; runs north-east through the District, passing within 2 miles of Pesh\u00e1war, and falls into the Sh\u00e1h Alam branch of the K\u00e1b\u00fal river shortly before its junction with the main stream. Near the fort of B\u00e1r\u00e1, the river is intercepted by three cuts, of which one conveys water to the town of Pesh\u00e1war, while the other supplies the water-courses of the Khal\u00edls and Mohmands. The lower channel is consequently dry for the greater portion of the year; but heavy rains in the T\u00edra Hills render it impassable for days together. The roads to Kohat and Attock cross the B\u00e1r\u00e1, over good timber bridges. The stream gives its name to the celebrated B\u00e1r\u00e1 rice, which grows along its banks. The Sikhs required the whole crop to be brought to Pesh\u00e1war, where the best portion was reserved for seed; the second best was sent to Ranj\u00edt Singh at Lahore, and the remainder was left to the zamind\u00e1rs. The B\u00e1r\u00e1 is regarded as a sacred river, and the spot where its waters are first divided forms a special object of veneration. The Northern State Punjab Railway crosses the river by an iron bridge.\n\n**Bara.**\u2014Village in Un\u00e1o District, Oudh; 16 miles south of Purwa, and 24 east of Un\u00e1o town. Lat. 26\u00b0 21' N., long. 80\u00b0 46' E. Founded by an eponymous R\u00e1j\u00e1 B\u00e1r\u00e1 of the Bhar tribe, about 2000 years ago. Population (1881) 1627, namely, Hindus, 1541, and Musalm\u00e1ns, 86. Goldsmiths' and carpenters' work, indigo manufactory. Two Hindu temples; school; post-office, and police station.\n\n**Bara Banki.**\u2014District in Oudh, under the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces, lying between 26\u00b0 31' 30\" and 27\u00b0 21'\n15\u00b0 N. lat., and between 80\u00b0 58' and 81\u00b0 54' E. long.; area, 1768 square miles; population in 1881, 1,026,788 souls. The easternmost of the three Districts which make up the Lucknow Division. Bara Banki is bounded on the north and west by Sitapur and Lucknow, on the south by Rai Bareli and Sultanpur, on the east by Faizabad, and on the north-east by the broad streams of the Chauka and Gogra (Ghagra), which separate it from Bahraich and Gonda.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Like the rest of the Oudh portion of the Ganges basin, Bara Banki consists of an almost level plain, falling gradually from north-west to south-east towards the Bay of Bengal, at a gentle gradient of 3 feet in the mile; with lateral inclinations at a gradient of 6 feet in the mile towards the beds of its main rivers, the Gogra and the Gumti. The regularity of this gentle seaward slope suggests the belief that the plain was originally levelled by marine denudation; then slowly raised above the waters by the gradual silting up of the mouths of some ancient Himalayan river debouching upon it; next, covered with sand and soil washed down from the mountains; and fashioned at last to its present configuration by the scour of a tropical rainfall. The floods of ages, fed by mountain glaciers, and pouring over this slanting plain, have cut through it two great channels to the sea, the valleys of the Ganges and the Gogra. Along the right bank of the latter river, Bara Banki District stretches for 48 miles, and spreads inland for about 30 miles, over the water-parting which divides the immediate basin of the Gogra from that of its affluent the Gumti; it then slopes down the watershed and into the Gumti valley. Crossing the District from stream to stream, each of its leading features presents itself in turn. Leaving behind the broad Gogra, known here as the Chauka, until at Bahramghat it meets the Sarju, a strip of loose, white river sand is crossed, hot and glaring even under a morning sun; then a tangle of tamarisk and tall sarpat grass (Saccharum moonja), the haunt of wild boar, deer, and nilgai; and farther on, a cool green champaign, dotted with groups of grazing cattle, and chequered with patches of rice and clumps of stunted acacia (babul). Thence out of the flat alluvial valley of the Gogra, the road leads for some 25 feet up a broken sandy ridge, the western edge of the valley, over an uneven undulating region, poorly cultivated and timbered, to a broad sheet of level cultivation, brisk with crowded villages, and set so thick with groves of mango that everywhere they meet the sky, and form a near background to a landscape full of quiet charm.\n\nIn the heart of this tract lies a chain of small shallow lakes (talabs) and marshes (jhils), which fill a series of slight depressions in the level plain, and testify to its alluvial origin. Unconnected in dry weather, in the rains they fill and spread and link together in a long line, stretching for many miles parallel to the course of the river.\nStill bearing westwards, we come to a narrow stream creeping between steep banks fringed with brushwood and broken by ravines. This is the Kaly\u00e1ni, an affluent of the G\u00famti, and the main channel by which the chain of jhils is drained. In the great flood of 1871, a torrent 90 yards broad and 5 fathoms deep, discharging more than 50,000 cubic feet a second, poured along it. Between the Kaly\u00e1ni and the G\u00famti lies the richest section of the District. The general aspect is not unlike that of the plain already described, but the crops are better watered and heavier, the patches of waste land fewer, the groves and villages somewhat more frequent. The G\u00famti is a winding river, 40 yards broad, fordable, flowing with many sudden twists and gentle curves along a deep channel 50 feet below the crest of the bank from which you look down upon it. Innumerable ravines cut up the country along its course, and penetrate deep into the inland plateau.\n\nHistory.\u2014The early annals of Bara Banki have been little studied. Its legends have still to be gathered, its ancient places are not yet explored. Memories of pre-historic times still linger here and there. In June, on the \u2018Day of Snakes,\u2019 worshippers assemble at Majitha near Naw\u00e1bganj, at Pur\u00e1i near Siddhaur, and at the Dighi Tank at Ali\u00e1b\u00e1d, to offer milk and rice at these legendary haunts of the kindly serpent-kings (N\u00e1gas). Physical blessings, such as the cure of goitred throats, are believed to be in their gift. A historical significance underlies this survival of a primitive aboriginal religion\u2014the worship of the serpent in the \u00c6sculapian character, recalling a long distant past, when the now mythical N\u00e1gas were a ruling and civilised race. At Ali\u00e1b\u00e1d and Siddhaur, high mounds of curious shape, fragments of stone temples, and bricks of unusual size, belong perhaps to the period when the Buddhist King Asoka (250 B.C.) erected stupas at such places as the serpent-tank (N\u00e1ga-hrada) of Ahichhatra, \u2018near which Buddha had preached the law for seven days in favour of the serpent-king\u2019 (General Cunningham\u2019s Ancient Geography of India, i. p. 361). The period of Buddhist ascendancy seems to have been synchronous with the sway of a once powerful but now degraded tribe, the Bhars. Here, and in the neighbouring Districts of southern and eastern Oudh, the land is thickly strewn with relics of their wealth and power, in the shape of tanks and wells and embankments, and the deserted sites (dilis) of brick-built forts and towns. In western Oudh, Thatheras, Jhojhas, Arakhs, and R\u00e1jp\u00e1sias occupy the corresponding page in local history.\n\nThe revival of Br\u00e1hmanism was apparently accompanied by the forcible displacement of these low-caste Buddhist tribes by Kshattriya warriors. A murderous struggle was still going on when the Muhammadan invasions took place. The exhaustion of Bhars and Kshattriyas alike, and the difficulty of rallying both against the common foe, contributed to the invader\u2019s success. An outline of the Muhammadan conquest of\nBara Banki indicates the extent to which the Kshattriyas had displaced the Bhars in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries. In 1030 A.D. the first Muhammadan invader of Oudh, Sayyid S\u00e1l\u00e1r Mas\u00e1ud, fought his way past M\u00falt\u00e1n, Delhi, Meerut (Mirath), and Kanauj, to Satrikh in Bara Banki, then a city of importance and a frequented shrine. From Satrikh, Kintur, Narindgarh, now called Thahim\u00e1b\u00e1d, and Subeha, he drove out the Bhars, while at Sihali he defeated the Sihar\u00edas, and at Dewa the Janw\u00e1r Kshattriyas. The first permanent Muhammadan settlement in Oudh seems to have been made at Satrikh. In 1189 A.D., the Sihar\u00edas were finally conquered by Aus\u00e1ri Shaikhs; in 1238 Sayyid Abdul W\u00e1hid seized Johelpur from the Bhars, and named it Zaidpur. About the same time, the Sayyids of Kheoli, near Dewa, won the domain now held by them from the Bhars of Bhitauli; while Bh\u00e1ti Muhammadans, from Bhatnair, wrested Barauli from the Bais Kshattriyas, and Maw\u00e1i-Mahol\u00e1ra from the Bhars; Rudauli was conquered from the Bhars in 1300, and Ras\u00falpur in 1355. To the 15th century, when Oudh was the battle-field between the Sharki dynasty of Jaunpur and the Lodhi kings of Delhi, is assigned the military colonization of Dari\u00e1b\u00e1d by D\u00e1r\u00e1\u00edo Kh\u00e1n, Subahd\u00e1r of Fatehpur by his brother Fateh Kh\u00e1n, and of Kami\u00e1r and the Kalhans country on both sides of the Gogra (Gh\u00e1gra) by Achal Singh, one of his lieutenants, an adventurer from Guzerat, of foreign, some say English, extraction. At the present day, the lords of 6 great t\u00e1luk\u00eds, and 20,000 Kalhans clansmen look back to Achal Singh with pride as the founder of their family and fortunes. In the same disturbed period, Har\u00e1ha was garrisoned with Surajbansi, and Surajpur with Sombansi Kshattriyas. It is uncertain whether the great colony of Raikw\u00e1r Kshattriyas in R\u00e1mnagar dates from this or from an older time.\n\nThe annalist of Bahraich fixes 1414 A.D. (though S\u00edt\u00e1pur tradition places it 200 years earlier) as the date when Saldeo and Baldeo\u2014Surajbansi emigrants from Kashmir, taking a tribal name from their native village, Raika\u2014sought service with the Bhar R\u00e1j\u00e1s of R\u00e1mnagar in Bara Banki, and of Bamnauti, now Baundi, across the Gogra in Bahraich. Each in time supplanted his master, and ruled in his stead. So founded, the Raikw\u00e1r colony grew, and spread for 60 miles along either bank of the river. In the reign of Akbar, gallant service in Kashmir earned for the Raikw\u00e1r chieftain, Harhardeo, the grant of pargan\u00e1 Sa\u00edlak (now R\u00e1mnagar and Muhammadpur) in Bara Banki, and of eight other pargan\u00e1s, whole or part, in Bahraich, S\u00edt\u00e1pur, and Kheri. In 1751 the recent successful raid of the Rohill\u00e1s, and the absence of the imperial troops in Rohilkhand, tempted the Raikw\u00e1rs to head a great rising of Hindus against the Muhammadan Government. Prominent among their fellow-rebels were the Bisens of Gonda and the Janw\u00e1r Kshattriyas of Balr\u00e1mpur. Marching upon Lucknow, they were met at Chulaha Gh\u00e1t, on the Kaly\u00e1ni, by the\nShaikhzad\u00e1s of Lucknow, and the Khanzad\u00e1s of Mahm\u00fad\u00e1l\u00e1hr\u00e1d and Bil\u00e1hra. After a fierce conflict, in which 15,000 men were killed and wounded on both sides, the Muhammadans won the day. The Khanzad\u00e1s rose into power, the Raikw\u00e1rs for a time lost it; the t\u00e1lukds of Baundi and R\u00e1mnagar were broken up, and the Raikw\u00e1r R\u00e1j\u00e1 retained only a few of his villages. In the evil times which set in on the death of Sa\u00e1dat Ali Kh\u00e1n in 1814, the Raikw\u00e1rs recovered their lost estates; and before the annexation in 1856 they had become masters of a larger domain than had been theirs in 1751. Under the Native Government, Dary\u00e1b\u00e1d District, as it was then called, bore an evil reputation for turbulence and disorder. In jungles and ravines along the G\u00famti and Kaly\u00e1ni lay the strongholds of many bandits, such as the Bareli\u00e1 Bais R\u00e1j\u00e1 Singhji of Surajpur, Mahipat Singh of Bhaw\u00e1n\u00edgarh, and Gang\u00e1 Baksh of K\u00e1s\u00fanganj, whose crimes are recorded in Sir W. Sleeman\u2019s Diary.\n\nIn 1856, the District, with the rest of Oudh, came under British rule. During the Sepoy war of 1857\u201358, the whole of the Bara Banki t\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs joined the mutineers, but offered no serious resistance after the capture of Lucknow. At the battle of Naw\u00e1bganj (June 1858) the Raikw\u00e1r zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs of S\u00edt\u00e1pur and Bahraich fought and fell with all the historic heroism of R\u00e1jputs. The Queen of Oudh, driven from Lucknow, had fled for refuge to their fort at Baundi, and these chivalrous chiefs were devoted to her cause. \u2018I have seen,\u2019 wrote the British general, \u2018many battles in India, and many brave fellows fighting with a determination to conquer or die, but I never witnessed anything more magnificent than the conduct of these zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs.\u2019 Order was re-established in July 1858. In 1859 the head-quarters were removed from Dary\u00e1b\u00e1d, where stagnant pools produced malarious fever, to Naw\u00e1bganj. The District consisted at this time of 13 pargan\u00e1s grouped into the 3 Sub-divisions (tahsils) of Naw\u00e1bganj, Dary\u00e1b\u00e1d-Rudauli, and R\u00e1mnagar. In 1869\u201370, 5 new pargan\u00e1s were added, viz. Bhitauli from Bahraich, Dewa and Kursi from Lucknow, Subeha from Sult\u00e1npur, and Haidargarh from R\u00e1i Bareli. Pargan\u00e1 Siddhaur was divided into Siddhaur North and South; and the 19 pargan\u00e1s thus made up were arranged in the 4 Sub-divisions of Bara Banki, Fatehpur Ramsanehi, and Haidargarh.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1869 returned the population of the District, according to its present area, at 1,113,430 souls. The next Census, in 1881, showed a population of 1,026,788, or a decrease of 86,642 on the enumeration of 1869. The male population in 1881 numbered 523,581, and the female 503,207. Area of District, 1768 square miles; average density of population, 580\u00b77 per square mile; number of towns and villages, 2061; villages per square mile, 1\u00b716; number of occupied houses, 187,557, with an average of 5\u00b74 inmates\nin each; number of houses per square mile, 106. Classified according to religion, the population is returned as follows:\u2014Hindus, 855,164; Muhammadans, 170,556; Sikhs, 28; Christians, 78; Jains, 962. Among high-caste Hindus, Br\u00e1hmans were returned at 86,219, R\u00e1jputs at 40,443, and K\u00e1yasths at 13,384. The Baniy\u00e1s or trading caste numbered 15,015. Of other castes the principal are the K\u00farm\u00eds (the most numerous caste in the District), 147,546; Ah\u00edrs, 121,068; P\u00e1s\u00eds, 98,770; Cham\u00e1rs, 64,598; Lodh\u00eds, 30,890; Kor\u00eds, 25,683; Kachh\u00eds, 22,243; Kah\u00e1rs, 20,944; G\u00e1d\u00e1ri\u00e1s, 17,849; Bhurj\u00eds, 15,904; Nais, 13,262; Loni\u00e1s, 13,041; Dhob\u00eds, 12,521; and Tel\u00eds, 10,229. Of the Muhammadans, 165,276 are returned as belonging to the Sunn\u00ed, and 5280 to the Shi\u00e1 sect. Of the Christians, 20 are returned as Europeans, 40 as Eurasiens, and 18 as Natives. More than nine-tenths (94.8 per cent.) of the population is rural. Only 6 towns have more than 5000 inhabitants. These are NAWABGANJ (13,933), RUDAULI (11,394), ZAIDPUR (9181), FATEHPUR (7754), RAMNAGAR (5376), and DARYABAD (5538). Of the 2061 villages and towns, 612 contain less than 200 inhabitants; 781 from 200 to 500; 475 from 500 to 1000; 149 from 1000 to 2000; 24 from 2000 to 3000; 14 from 3000 to 5000; 4 from 5000 to 10,000; and 2 from 10,000 to 15,000.\n\nAs regards occupation, the Census Report classifies the male population into the following six groups:\u2014(1) Professional, including civil and military officers, all Government officials, and the learned professions, 8685; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, etc., 2512; (3) commercial class, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 6582; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 258,428; (5) manufacturing and industrial class, 52,481; (6) indefinite and non-productive (including 15,577 general labourers, 39 persons of rank and property not returned under any occupation, and 179,277 unspecified, principally male children), 194,893.\n\n**Agriculture.**\u2014Out of a total area of 1768 square miles in 1881, 1123 are returned as under cultivation, 343 as cultivable, and 302 as uncultivable waste. The staple crops are wheat and rice, which occupy nearly half the cultivated area. The area under the different crops in 1880\u201381 is thus returned:\u2014Rice, 132,820 acres; wheat, 190,613; other food grains, 373,601; oil-seeds, 2134; sugar-cane, 12,507; opium, 9857; indigo, 26; fibres, 54; tobacco, 983; vegetables, 4480. Poppy cultivation has been greatly stimulated of late years, the area under that crop having risen from 2681 acres in 1868, to 9857 acres in 1881. The out-turn of opium in 1882 was 2098 maunds, or 1536 cwt.; the price paid for it by Government to the producer, namely, 10s. the ser, amounting to \u00a328,000. The crops commonly irrigated are wheat, sugar-cane, peas, lentils, and melons. Cane and melons receive seven or eight waterings.\nThe rivers in the dry season flow too far below the level of the country on their banks to be of much use for irrigation, but ponds and small shallow lakes (jhils) are numerous (covering 7 per cent. of the total area), and yield a precarious water-supply. Irrigation from them is costly work. The water is swung up in buckets over successive 'lifts,' until the fields are reached. Two pairs of labourers work at each lift, relieving each other hour by hour; another pair guides the slender stream over the thirsty fields. It takes 18 men to work a four-lift watercourse; and as in most seasons two waterings are absolutely necessary, it has been calculated that to irrigate by this method costs 8s. 4d. an acre. Irrigation from wells is widely practised, and is preferred for the crops. Water is generally found at about 30 feet below the surface, and unbricked (kachh\u00e1) wells, watering from 5 to 10 acres, can be dug for from 6s. to 12s. They seldom, however, last longer than a year, unless lined with the twisted stems of the malabar nut (rusa). A leather bag, worked by two men and a pair of bullocks, is used for drawing the water. To dig a new kachh\u00e1 well, and to give the required couple of waterings, costs, on an average, 6s. 8d. an acre. In the north-eastern part of the District, between the Kaly\u00e1ni and Gogra, the sandiness of the subsoil makes irrigation far more difficult. Only very small wells can here be dug; every day or two sand falling from the sides chokes the spring, and has to be cleared out. Nothing larger than an earthen pitcher, worked by hand over a pulley or by a lever, can here be used.\n\nThe average rates of rent per acre in 1881 for land growing the different crops, is returned as follows:\u2014Rice, 17s. 6d.; wheat, 20s. 9d.; inferior grains, 11s. 3d.; indigo, 34s.; cotton, 8s.; opium, 40s.; oil-seeds, 13s. 4d.; fibres, 14s.; sugar-cane, 28s. 6d.; tobacco, 37s. 9d. These are the rates officially returned in the Revenue Administration Report for Oudh in 1880-81, but they seem excessive when compared with those returned for neighbouring Districts, and are in fact much higher than those given for any other District in the Province. As stated below, it will be seen that the average rent for all varieties of land is just under 9s. an acre, according to the Census of 1881.\n\nAverage produce of land per acre:\u2014Rice, 343 lbs.; wheat, 503 lbs.; inferior grains, 551 lbs.; indigo, 106 lbs.; cotton, 144 lbs.; opium, 313 lbs.; oil-seeds, 242 lbs.; fibres, 202 lbs.; sugar, 2656 lbs.; tobacco, 632 lbs. Prices of food grains and agricultural produce per cwt. in September 1881:\u2014Rice, 1st quality, 11s. 7d. per cwt.; 2nd quality, 6s. 7d.; wheat, 1st quality, 5s. 5d.; 2nd quality, 5s. 1d.; gram, 1st quality, 4s. 9d.; 2nd quality, 4s. 7d.; sugar (refined), 40s. 9d.; sugar (raw), 9s. The estimated agricultural stock in the District in 1881 was returned as follows:\u2014Cows and bullocks, 175,817; horses, 468; ponies, 3523; donkeys, 3975; sheep and goats, 58,445; pigs, 39,289; carts, 1980; ploughs, 111,147.\nThree-fifths of the District is owned by large proprietors (t\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs), the rest by village coparceners. Muhammadans, though forming only 16\u00bd per cent. of the population, owned in 1874, 938 out of 2093 villages. Of the 1155 villages owned by Hindus, 826 were held by Kshattriyas, chiefly of the Raikw\u00e1r and Surajbans clans; 97 by K\u00e1yasths, 86 by Br\u00e1hmans, and 35 by K\u00farm\u00eds.\n\nThe cultivators are for the most part tenants-at-will, rack-rented and debt-ridden, without any rights in the soil, and very inadequately protected from enhancement and eviction. Competition, displacing custom in the settlement of rents, is gradually reducing them to the status of cottiers. The total number of adult male agriculturists in 1881, excluding labourers, was returned at 197,642, cultivating an average of 2\u00b779 acres each. The total population, however, wholly dependent on the soil, numbered 744,696, or 72\u00b753 per cent. of the District population. Of the total District area of 1768 square miles, 1748 are assessed for Government revenue, of which 1102 square miles are actually cultivated, and 265 cultivable. Total amount of Government assessment, including local rates and cesses levied on land, \u00a3166,826, or 4s. 8\u00bcd. per cultivated acre; total rental paid by cultivators, \u00a3322,864, or a fraction under 9s. per cultivated acre. Wages, it is stated, have not risen. A skilled field labourer gets from 4s. to 5s. a month in money; yearly presents of grain and a blanket raise his total earnings to from \u00a32, 14s. to \u00a33, 6s. a year, or from 1s. to 1s. 3d. a week. A day\u2019s work at the water-lift earns 1\u00bdd. and three ounces of roasted maize; at wells, 3d. worth of field beans. On road-work, hodmen get 2\u00bcd., and excavators 3d. a day; 4\u00bdd. is the daily wage of blacksmiths and carpenters.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014In the last great famine, that of 1837\u201338, when severe drought followed a succession of poor harvests, the price of gram rose to Rs. 8 a maund, or \u00a31, 1s. 10\u00bdd. a cwt. There has been no such dearth since. In 1865 and 1868, droughts brought up the price of flour to Rs. 5 a maund, or 13s. 8d. a cwt., for some months, and in 1873 to Rs. 3. 10. 0, or 9s. 10\u00bdd. a cwt. In 1871 and 1872, heavy floods poured down the Kaly\u00e1ni, and, by stopping all field-work, caused even sharper distress to the labouring classes than drought, during which there is often a brisk demand for labour at wells. In the severe drought of 1877\u201378, the price of wheat rose to 9 sers per rupee, or 12s. 5d. per cwt.; cheaper grains in proportion. The approach of famine will be threatened whenever the price of millets or barley rises, for more than a month, to Rs. 2. 3. 0 a maund, or 6s. per cwt. With two navigable rivers, bridged roads between the chief towns, and road and railway communication with Cawnpur, Lucknow, Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d, and Bahramgh\u00e1t, the District is in no danger of isolation.\nCommerce and Trade.\u2014Trade is carried on at bi-weekly markets and at religious festivals. At the marts of Naw\u00e1bganj and Tik\u00e1itnagar the traffic is mainly in grain, treacle, molasses, English and country made cloth, and vessels of iron and brass; in grain and cloth at Sa\u00e1datganj, Tilokpur, Udhauti, and Zaidpur; grain and cotton at Chamierganj; grain and cattle at Siddhaur. The imports are piece-goods from Cawnpur, salt from Agra and Delhi, coarse red cloth (khar\u00eda) and coloured stuffs from Kalp\u00ed; turmeric, pepper, and spices from Gorakhpur and Nep\u00e1l. The main exports are wheat, sugar, and country-made cloth. There is an extensive through traffic by road, rail, and river. S\u00e1l logs from the forests of Oudh and Nep\u00e1l are floated down the Gandak to Bahramgh\u00e1t, to be carted thence to Lucknow and Cawnpur. Rice, maize, and oil-seeds come over the Gogra from Bahraich, and are shipped from Puraina Gh\u00e1t to Lower Bengal in country boats, or despatched by road to Cawnpur. Trade is growing, and the income from tolls at the boat bridge at Bahramgh\u00e1t is steadily increasing. The manufactures of the District are plain and coloured cloth of coarse quality from home-spun and imported yarn; the extraction of sugar and treacle from the cane; brass and iron vessels for domestic use; and the rude implements, ornaments, and utensils of the farm and hut.\n\nThe main streams of land traffic flow along 71 miles of railway, opened in 1882, and an equal length of metalled road, from Bahramgh\u00e1t and Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d to Naw\u00e1bganj, and thence to Lucknow and Cawnpur. The Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway has eleven of its stations in the District, and from these, in 1873, were received and despatched 337,081 passengers and 992 tons of goods. The total length of roads in the District in 1882\u201383 was 495 miles, connecting all the leading towns and markets of the District. Water communication is afforded by 161 miles of navigable rivers.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1860, the land tax was \u00a383,599; during the regular settlement (1865\u20131867) it was raised to \u00a3122,521. In 1869\u201370, the addition of the new pargan\u00e1s brought it up to \u00a3157,521; in 1880\u201381 it amounted to \u00a3167,719; and in 1882\u201383 to \u00a3166,116. The total imperial revenue is higher than in any other District in Oudh; it amounted in 1872 to \u00a3171,425; in 1880\u201381 to \u00a3182,920; and in 1882\u201383 to \u00a3185,621. The charges for civil administration in the latter year were \u00a312,677, being, with the exception of Bahraich, the lowest of any of the Oudh Districts. The District is administered under the non-regulation system by a Deputy-Commissioner, 2 Assistant Commissioners and 3 extra-Assistant Commissioners, and 4 tahsild\u00e1rs. Each of these officers, in addition to executive duties, presides as magistrate and judge over a criminal, civil, and rent-suit court. The judicial machinery is strengthened by\nthe unpaid services of 4 honorary magistrates, selected from among the native gentlemen of the District.\n\nFor police purposes the District is divided into 9 circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s). In 1880, the regular police force numbered 453 of all ranks, and cost \u00a36113. A municipal or town force, of 68 officers and men, was also kept up at a cost of \u00a3438. A rural police of 3522 village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs) was maintained by the landowners at a cost of \u00a37131. Total police force, 4043 officers and men, or 1 man to every '44 square mile of area and to every 254 persons of population; total cost, \u00a313,682, or an average of \u00a37, 14s. 8d. per square mile, and 3\u00bdd. per head. During the six years ending 1872, the average number of convictions for rioting, theft, robbery, coining, culpable homicide, and murder, was 627. In 1880, the number of convictions was 670, out of a total of 3417 'cognisable' cases investigated by the police. Five-sixths of the convictions were for theft. The Raikw\u00e1rs of R\u00e1mnagar still practise female infanticide. A special Census undertaken in 53 of their villages in 1871 showed that, out of every 5 girls born, 2 had probably been made away with. Education in 1880-81 was afforded by 145 schools, either supported or aided by Government, and attended by 5126 pupils. This is exclusive of uninspected and unaided schools. The Census Report returned a total of 5677 boys and 54 girls under instruction in 1881; besides 22,666 males and 288 females able to read and write, but not under instruction.\n\nThe District is divided into 19 pargan\u00e1s or clusters of villages, grouped under 4 Sub-divisions (tahs\u00edls).\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The year divides into three seasons\u2014the hot weather from the end of March to the middle of June, then the rains till the end of September or beginning of October, and the cold weather till March comes round again. The average rainfall for the 15 years ending 1881 was 37\u00b758 inches; varying from 21 inches in 1868 to 64 inches in 1871. In 1881, the rainfall amounted to 31\u00b758 inches, being 6\u00b708 inches below the average. The prevailing diseases are epidemic cholera, small-pox, and malarial fevers, of a mild, intermittent, quotidian type. Cases of tertian and remittent fevers are rare. A few sporadic cases of cattle-disease occurred in 1871 and 1872, but there has been no serious outbreak. [For further information regarding Bara Banki, see the Settlement Report of the District, 1879, by Lieutenant-Colonel F. E. A. Chamier; the Oudh Gazetteer, by Mr. C. M'Minn, C.S. (Lucknow Press); the North-Western Provinces and Oudh Census Report for 1881; and the Provincial Administration Reports for 1880 to 1882.]\n\nBara Banki (or Naw\u00e1b\u00edganj).\u2014Tahsil or Sub-division of Bara Banki District, Oudh; bounded on the north by Fatehpur, on the east by R\u00e1m San\u00e9hi, on the south by Haidargarh and by Mohanl\u00e1lganj in\nLucknow, and on the west by Lucknow and Malihabad in Lucknow District. Area, 357 square miles, of which 229 are cultivated. Population (1881) 212,068, namely, Hindus, 166,588; Muhammadans, 45,031; 'others,' 449; number of villages or towns, 392. The tahsil consists of the five parganas of Nawabganj, Dewa, Satrikh, Siddhaur North, and Partabganj. The administrative staff consists of a Deputy Commissioner, Assistant Commissioner, 2 Honorary Assistant Commissioners, 3 extra-Assistant Commissioners, 1 tahsildar, and 1 munsif. These officers preside over 1 civil and 8 criminal courts. Number of police stations (thana), 5; strength of regular police, 41 men, besides a body of village watchmen (chaukidars).\n\nBara Banki.\u2014Town in Bara Banki District, Oudh, about 1 mile north of Nawabganj, the two places together forming the administrative head-quarters of the District. Lat. 26\u00b0 56' 10\" N., long. 81\u00b0 13' 10\" E. Before the Muhammadan conquest the place was known as Jasnaul, having been founded by a Bhar Rajah named Jas, some 900 years ago. After the Musalm\u00e1n invasion of Kanauj, the new owners are said to have divided the place into 12 shares, over which they quarrelled so incessantly that they were called the Bara Bankas, or 12 quarrelsome men, whence the present name of the town. Others derive the name from ban, meaning jungle, and interpret Bara Banki as the 12 shares of jungle. The lands belonging to the town are much sub-divided, and the inhabitants are chiefly small Musalm\u00e1n proprietors and their dependants. Population (1881) 13,933, namely, Hindus, 8640; Muhammadans, 4933; Jains, 344; and Christians, 16. Municipal income in 1880-81, \u00a31041, of which \u00a3890 was derived from octroi duties; expenditure, \u00a31014. The civil station is at Nawabganj, and further particulars will be found in the article under that head.\n\nBarab\u00e1r.\u2014Hills in Gay\u00e1 District, Bengal; a range of great interest to the archaeologist, as it contains many remarkable antiquarian remains; lying between 25\u00b0 1' and 25\u00b0 2' 30\" N. lat., and between 85\u00b0 3' 30\" and 85\u00b0 7' E. long.; between 6 and 8 miles east of the Bel\u00e1 Station on the Patna and Gay\u00e1 State Railway. On the highest peak (Barab\u00e1r) is an ancient temple sacred to Sidheswara, containing a linga, said to have been placed there by Bara Rajah, the Asur king of Dinajpur, whose bloody wars with Krishna still live in the remembrance of the people. A large fair, attended only by men, is held here in September. The pilgrims begin to arrive at daybreak, and spend the day on the hill; the night is devoted to the worship of the image, and in the morning the crowd begins to melt away. An extempore bazar is established for the day, at which sweetmeats and other offerings for the god are sold. The number who attended the mel\u00e1 in 1873 was roughly estimated at between 10,000 and 20,000 men. To the south, and near the base of this hill, the path up which is freely adorned with images of all kinds,\nlies a small recess, enclosed on two sides by the mountain, on a third by an artificial barrier of stone, and on the fourth by a long low ridge of granite. Here, in the solid rock, have been cut the remarkable caves which give the name of S\u00e1tghar (literally 'Seven Houses') to the glen. The four caves found in this part of the mountain average 32 feet by 14 feet; three of them are chiselled to a wonderful polish, the fourth being still unfinished. P\u00e1li inscriptions show that the oldest was cut in 252 B.C., and the latest in 214 B.C. The remaining three caves are on another spur of the hill, called Nagarjuni. Not far off is the sacred spring of Patalgang\u00e1, and at the base of the rugged peak of Kanw\u00e1dol ('Crow's Rocking-stone') is an enormous figure of Buddha. Many other figures and sculptures are found among these hills. They have been fully described by Dr. Buchanan Hamilton and General Cunningham. In the Bengal Atlas of Major Rennel, this cluster is called the Currumshaw Hills. Dr. Buchanan Hamilton points out that this name is a corruption of Karn\u00e1 Champar, or 'Karn\u00e1's Seat,' the name of an ancient ruin on the hills.\n\n**Bar\u00e1b\u00e1ti Fort.**\u2014The citadel of Cuttack town, in Cuttack District, Bengal; situated on the south bank of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed river opposite Cuttack. Lat. 20\u00b0 29' N., long. 85\u00b0 56' E. It is not known at what time it was built, but it probably dates not later than the 14th century. The original building is said to have been of Hindu origin, but the Muhammadan or Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 governors of Orissa, in 1750, added a round bastion, and constructed an arched gateway in the eastern face of the fort. This gateway, and a mosque called after Fateh Kh\u00e1n Rahim, are almost the only portions of the citadel which remain intact, much of the stone in the fort having been used by the officers of the Public Works Department for Government buildings. An unsightly series of earthen mounds, and a wilderness of stone pits, now mark the place where the fortress stood. It had double walls, built of stone, the inner of which enclosed a rectangular area measuring 2150 by 1800 feet. The eastern gateway was flanked by two lofty square towers, and from the centre of the fort rose a huge square bastion supporting a flagstaff. Altogether the appearance of the edifice was very imposing, and presented to the imagination of M. la Motte, who travelled through Orissa in 1767, some resemblance to Windsor Castle. The fort was captured by the English in 1803, in their campaign against the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s.\n\n**Bar\u00e1chat\u00ed.**\u2014Village and head-quarters of a police circle (th\u00e1n\u00e1) on the Grand Trunk Road, 20 miles south of Gay\u00e1, in Gay\u00e1 District, Bengal. Lat. 24\u00b0 30' 10\" N., long. 85\u00b0 3' 10\" E. Has a local police of 18 men. There used to be good shooting of all kinds near here, and tigers are still met with in the neighbourhood. There is a d\u00e1k bungalow.\n\n**Bar\u00e1 Dehi.**\u2014The highest of the four chief peaks of the Assi\u00e1 range\nof hills in Cuttack District, Bengal. At the foot of the mountain is the ruined seat of the old Hindu hill chieftain.\n\n**Bar\u00e1g\u00e1i** (or *Marang Buru*).\u2014A hill in Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, Bengal. Height above the sea, 3445 feet; above the Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur plateau, 1300 feet; and above the D\u00e1modar valley, 2400 feet. Lat. 23\u00b0 32' 45\" N., long. 85\u00b0 29' 45\" E. There is a good deal of j\u00fam cultivation on the upper slopes of the hill.\n\n**Bar\u00e1g\u00e1on** (or *Chit-Firozpur*).\u2014Town in Ballia District, North-Western Provinces, lying on the banks of the Little Sarju river, 10 miles west of Ballia town on the Gh\u00e1z\u00edpur Road; lat. 25\u00b0 45' 4\" N., long. 84\u00b0 2' 39\" E. Population (1881) 10,847, namely, Hindus, 9892, and Muhammadans, 955; area of town site, 92 acres. An important agricultural centre.\n\n**Bar\u00e1g\u00e1on.**\u2014Town in S\u00edt\u00e1pur District, Oudh; 17 miles north-west from S\u00edt\u00e1pur town. Population (1881) 2081. Bi-weekly market, at which cotton, salt, and iron from the North-Western Provinces are sold, and also cloth and sugar of local manufacture. Annual value of sales estimated at \u00a35785. Government school.\n\n**Bar\u00e1g\u00e1ri.**\u2014Town in Rangpur District, Bengal. Population (1881) 5668, namely, Hindus, 4571, and Muhammadans, 1097; area, 2655 acres.\n\n**Bara Haldibari.**\u2014Town in Kuch Behar State, Bengal. Population (1881) 5230, namely, males 2761, and females 2469.\n\n**Barah.**\u2014Tahsil of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces, in a rugged country south of the Jumna (Jamun\u00e1), stretching upward to the K\u00e1imur Hills. Area, 252.2 square miles, of which 121.5 are cultivated; population (1881) 53,430; land revenue, \u00a313,058; total revenue, \u00a314,664; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a320,032. The tahsil contains one criminal court, with two police stations (*th\u00e1n\u00e1s*); strength of regular police, 25 men; village watchmen (*chaukid\u00e1irs*), 132.\n\n**Barah.**\u2014Village in Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of Barah tahsil, distant about 5 miles from the Jasra station on the Jabalpur branch line of the East Indian Railway. An inconsiderable village, with a population in 1881 of 1965. It derives its sole importance from being the head-quarters of the tahsil. It also contains a second-class police station, school, and post-office.\n\n**Barah.**\u2014Rural town in Gh\u00e1z\u00edpur District, North-Western Provinces, lies on the alluvial plain of the Ganges. Lat. 25\u00b0 30' 30\" N., long. 83\u00b0 54' 15\" E.; area, 139 acres; population (1872) 5424. In 1881, the population had decreased to below 5000, and the town is not returned separately in the Census Report.\n\n**Barahtiya.**\u2014Town in Chittagong Sub-division, Chittagong District, Bengal. Population (1881) 5043, namely, 2242 males and 2801 females.\nBarail (Barel).\u2014Hill range on north boundary of Cachar District, Assam.\u2014See BAREL.\n\nB\u00e1rak (or Surm\u00e1).\u2014River of North-Eastern India, which waters the southern valley of the Province of Assam, comprising the Districts of Cachar and Sylhet. Its source lies among the Cachar mountains occupied by the wild tribe of Ang\u00e1m\u00ed N\u00e1g\u00e1s in the neighbourhood of Koh\u00edma. For about 180 miles it flows in a narrow valley, shut in between steep hills, in a south-south-west direction, until it touches British territory at the village of Tip\u00e1i-mukh. Here it is joined by the Tip\u00e1i river from the south, and abruptly turns due north, forming for some distance the boundary between Cachar District and Manipur. On entering Cachar a little above B\u00e1nsk\u00e1ndi, it becomes navigable throughout the year by native boats. For four months of the year, from June to September, it is navigable beyond Lakhipur by steamers. From Lakhipur its course lies almost due west through the two Districts of Cachar and Sylhet, but it describes many windings and large loops, some of which have been cut across and converted into marshes by recent floods. At the boundary between Cachar and Sylhet, near the village of B\u00e1ng\u00e1, it bifurcates into two branches, the larger and more northerly of which takes the name of the Surm\u00e1, the smaller and southerly branch being called the Kusiy\u00e1ra. After meandering with many sinuosities across Sylhet, both these branches ultimately fall into the Meghn\u00e1 on the border of Maimansingh District. The B\u00e1rak receives many tributaries on either bank, from North Cachar and the Kh\u00e1si and Jainti\u00e1 Hills on the north, and from the Lush\u00e1i country and Hill Tipperah on the south. The chief of these, proceeding downwards, are the Jiri, Chiri, Madhura, J\u00e1t\u00ednga, Lubah, Chengar Kh\u00e1l, and P\u00e1inda on the right bank; and the Sonai, K\u00e1t\u00e1kh\u00e1l, Langai, Manu, and Kho\u00e1r, on the left. These, with the exception of the Madhura, are navigable even in the cold season by small country boats.\n\nThe B\u00e1rak itself is a river of the first importance for navigation. Within British territory, its bed averages from 100 to 200 yards in width, and its minimum depth is $3\\frac{1}{2}$ feet. As is the case with all great rivers flowing through low-lying alluvial country, its banks have been raised by successive deposits of silt to a higher level than that of the surrounding plain. Consequently, when the B\u00e1rak itself and its tributary streams come down in flood, and the depth of water in its bed suddenly rises to as much as 40 feet, the inundation spreads far and wide over the plain. The fields annually fertilized in this manner do not need any artificial irrigation; and it is thought that the natural line of drainage would only be hindered by the construction of embankments. The B\u00e1rak forms the single means of communication between the Districts of Sylhet and Cachar and the outer world. Two\nlines of steamers, namely those of the Eastern Bengal Railway Company and the India General Steam Navigation Company, ply on the B\u00e1rak. The steamers stop anywhere for cargo, but have storehouses at Silchar, Sialtek, Sylhet town and Chhatak, on the Surma branch of the river; and at Kochuamak, Fenchuganj, and B\u00e1laganj on the Kusiy\u00e1ra branch. The main river and its tributaries are crowded with country boats, which require to be towed up against the stream.\n\nThe chief obstacles to navigation in the upper parts of the river are snags in the river bed. In the cold or dry season, a bank of hardened mud forms a rapid, called the Kaurya b\u00e1nk, some miles above Chhatak, which effectually bars the passage up the northerly branch to all except very small country boats. Similarly, on the southern branch, a ledge of rocks at Fenchuganj impedes steam navigation. There are other obstacles\u2014rocks, shallows, and mud\u2014on both branches of the river, above Chhatak and Fenchuganj. Except, however, when the water is at its lowest in February, a boat of 20 tons burthen can proceed up the Kusiy\u00e1ra branch as far as the point where the main stream bifurcates. In 1876\u201377, the river trade of Cachar and Sylhet Districts, as registered at Bhairab B\u00e1z\u00e1r on the Meghn\u00e1, showed a total of exports valued at \u00a31,109,574, against imports valued at \u00a3532,212. By 1880\u201381, the value of the export trade had increased to \u00a31,287,429, and the imports to \u00a3890,967. The most important item on the export side is tea, which amounted to 5,369,200 lbs. in 1876\u201377, as against 13,426,880 lbs. in 1880\u201381. There is a Government toll station at Si\u00e1ltekh in Cachar District, where timber, bamboos, etc., pay toll to the amount of about \u00a31800 a year.\n\nBar\u00e1khar.\u2014River in Bengal. Rises on the north face of the central plateau of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur; flows in a northerly direction as far as the Grand Trunk Road, after crossing which it turns east and then south-east, until it leaves Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh District and enters M\u00e1nbh\u00fam. About 32 miles from the point where it leaves Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh it joins the D\u00e1modar, on the boundary of Bardw\u00e1n and M\u00e1nbh\u00fam Districts, close to the village of Sankhtoria. In its course through M\u00e1nbh\u00fam District, it recrosses the Grand Trunk Road about 3 miles above the point of junction with the D\u00e1modar. Though everywhere fordable during the dry season, it is remarkable for the suddenness with which it rises during the rains, as well as for the strength of its current; and the construction of a bridge across it presents difficulties much more serious than could be inferred from its size. Boat traffic is impossible. Principal tributary, the Khudi\u00e1 in M\u00e1nbh\u00fam.\n\nBar\u00e1khati.\u2014Town or collection of villages in Rangpur District, Bengal. Population (1881) 11,393, namely, Hindus, 3520, and Muhammadans, 7873. Area, 11,179 acres.\n\nBar\u00e1kil\u00e1 and T\u00e1libunda.\u2014The highest peaks of the range on\nwhich the citadel of Adoni stands, in Bellary District, Madras Presidency. Height, 800 feet above the plain. Half-way up is a fine tank which is never dry, and on the summit grows a fig-tree forming a landmark for 20 or 30 miles in every direction.\n\n**Bar\u00e1kudu.**\u2014A division (mutt\u00e1) of the Godairi t\u00e1luk, Vizagapatam District, Madras Presidency. The Godairi estate, containing 150 villages, is among those proscribed by the Meri\u00e1h Agency, as addicted to human sacrifice.\u2014See GODAIRI.\n\n**Bar\u00e1kuli\u00e1 Kh\u00e1l.**\u2014River in the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, Bengal, forming part of the Outer Sundarbans Passage, one of the chief boat routes by means of which traffic is carried on between Calcutta and the Eastern Districts. An artificial watercourse, the S\u00e1hib Kh\u00e1li, connects the Bar\u00e1kuli\u00e1 with the K\u00e1lind\u00ed river.\n\n**Baral.**\u2014River in Bengal, an important offshoot of the Ganges in R\u00e1jsh\u00e1h\u00ed District. It leaves the parent stream near Chargh\u00e1t police station, and flows eastwards through the southern portion of the District, until it passes into Pabn\u00e1. It was formerly navigable throughout the year, but during the present century a sandbank has formed across its mouth, obstructing the free passage of water from the Ganges for six or seven months of every year. The Baral throws out two offshoots to the north, the Mus\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n and the Nand\u00e1kuja, the latter a river of some magnitude, which joins the Atrai a short distance to the north of the Chalan bil.\n\n**B\u00e1ra L\u00e1ch\u00e1.**\u2014Mountain pass in K\u00e1ngra District, Punjab, over the Western Him\u00e1layas, from D\u00e1reha in L\u00e1h\u00fal to the R\u00fapsh\u00fa country in Lad\u00e1kh. Lat. 32\u00b0 49\u2032 N., long. 77\u00b0 28\u2032 E.; elevation above the sea, 16,500 feet. Can be crossed by laden yaks and ponies. An excellent cart road might be constructed without difficulty.\n\n**Bar-Ali.**\u2014Old raised road or ali in Sibs\u00e1g\u00e1r District, Assam Province, running from N\u00e1zira to Dikhu-mukh. Length, 22 miles; annual cost of maintenance, \u00a3204. Much of the original embankment, constructed by forced labour under the Aham dynasty, has been cut away by floods of the Brahmaputra.\n\n**B\u00e1r\u00e1mahal ('The Twelve Estates').**\u2014A former Division, including parts or all of the Tripat\u00far, Kistnagiri, Dharampur, Uttankarai, Os\u00far, and Denkamkotai t\u00e1luks of the present Salem and North Arcot Districts, Madras Presidency. Lat. 12\u00b0 5\u2032 to 12\u00b0 45\u2032 N., long. 78\u00b0 10\u2032 to 79\u00b0 30\u2032 E. Twelve forts\u2014Krishnagiri, Jaya Rangarh, Varangarh, K\u00e1valgarh, M\u00e1har\u00e1jgarh, B\u00fajangarh, Gajangarh, Katt\u00edragarh, Tripat\u00far. V\u00e1n\u00edamb\u00e1di, Sath\u00e1rasangarh, and Thatukallu\u2014protected the tract, and on either side of it ran the Gh\u00e1ts. Originally part of the Vijayanagar domains, and governed by the Anag\u00fandi branch of that family, it passed in 1668 under Mysore rule. Early in the next century the Path\u00e1n Naw\u00e1bs of Karpa possessed themselves of the B\u00e1r\u00e1mahal, but, after a\ntenure of some fifty years, were ousted by Haidar Ali in 1759. The following year saw the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s masters of the country, but after their defeat at P\u00e1nipat, Haidar re-entered on possession. In 1767, an English force invested Krishnagiri, but was driven back after a gallant struggle by the troops of Haidar and the Niz\u00e1m. Reinforcements met the retiring force in the Chengamma Pass; and a few months later the English troops, attacking at two points, invaded the B\u00e1r\u00e1mahal and occupied several of its forts. Twice again, in 1790 and 1791, armies were despatched to reduce the tract, but one fortress, that of Krishnagiri, withstood all assaults. In 1792 the B\u00e1r\u00e1mahal was ceded to the English, and the name, under the new territorial division, was soon abandoned.\n\nB\u00e1r\u00e1mati.\u2014Town in Poona (Pun\u00e1) District, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 18\u00b0 8' 30\" N., long. 74\u00b0 36' 45\" E. Population (1881) 5272, namely, Hindus, 4641; Muhammadans, 499; and Jains, 132; area of town site, 107 acres; municipal revenue (1881-82) \u00a3600; rate of taxation, 2s. 2d. per head; municipal expenditure (1880-81) \u00a3480.\n\nBaramb\u00e1.\u2014One of the Tributary States of Orissa, lying between 20\u00b0 22' 15\" and 20\u00b0 31' 40\" N. lat., and between 85\u00b0 15' and 85\u00b0 31' 30\" E. long.; area, 137 square miles. Population (1881) 29,772. It is entirely surrounded by other Tributary States, being bounded on the north by Hindol, on the east by Tigari\u00e1, on the south by B\u00e1nk\u00ed and Khandp\u00e1r\u00e1 (the boundary-line being formed by the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed river), and on the west by Narsinghpur. Kanak\u00e1 Peak (2038 feet), the highest point of the hill range of the same name, is situated on the northern border of the State.\n\nA legend attributes the foundation of the State to a celebrated wrestler, to whom the Orissa monarch presented two villages. These villages were owned and inhabited by Kandhs, but the wrestler speedily drove out the aborigines, and gradually extended his territory at their expense. The present ruler, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bisambhar B\u00edrbar Mangr\u00e1j Mah\u00e1-patra, now (1883) a minor, 2 years of age, claims to be a Kshattriya by caste, and is the 21st R\u00e1j\u00e1 in descent from the original chief. The State yields an estimated revenue of \u00a32600, and pays \u00a3140 tribute to the British Government. The chief maintains a military force of 709 men, and his police are 188 strong. He also supports a school, and post-office. The State is now, and will remain during the minority of the Chief, under the direct management of Government.\n\nThe population of Baramb\u00e1, numbering, as has been said, 29,772 persons, inhabit 186 villages and 5662 houses. The number of Hindus is 26,069; Buddhists, 492; aboriginal tribes, chiefly Kandhs and Savars, 3093; and Muhammadans, 118. Number of males, 15,004, and females, 14,768. Average density of the population, 222 per square mile; villages per square mile, 139; persons per village, 160; houses per\nsquare mile, 79; persons per house, 5.4. The principal village and the residence of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 is Baramb\u00e1, in the centre of the State (lat. $20^\\circ 25' 15''$ N., long. $82^\\circ 22' 41''$ E.). The only other villages in the State worthy of notice are Gopin\u00e1thpur, Maniabandh, and Banamalipur\u2014all on the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed. At the two last-named villages trading fairs are held twice a week. The Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed affords excellent water-carriage, and logs of timber and bamboos are floated down the river to Cuttack and Pur\u00ed Districts.\n\n**Baramula.**\u2014Mountain gorge in Kashmir State, Punjab, through which the Jhelum (Jehlam) river passes. Lat. $34^\\circ 10'$ N., long. $74^\\circ 30'$ E. The town of Baramula stands on the right bank of the river, here spanned by a bridge of eight piers.\n\n**Baran.**\u2014Tahsil or Sub-division of Bulandshahr District, North-Western Provinces; known also as Bulandshahr tahsil. Lies in the centre of the Do\u00e1b plain; intersected throughout by the K\u00e1li Nad\u00ed, and in two places by branches of the Ganges Canal. Area, 478 square miles, of which 346 are cultivated. Population (1881) 262,901; land revenue at time of settlement, \u00a335,346; total revenue, \u00a339,033; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a390,585. The administrative staff consists of a munsif and tahsild\u00e1r, and four honorary magistrates, besides an executive engineer and deputy magistrate attached to the Canal Department. These officers preside over 1 civil and 8 criminal courts. Number of police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 6; strength of regular police, 62 men; village watchmen (chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs), 558; municipal and town police, 106.\n\n**Baran.**\u2014Head-quarters town of Bulandshahr District, North-Western Provinces.\u2014See Bulandshahr.\n\n**Baran.**\u2014Town in Kotah Native State of R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Population (1881) 7714.\n\n**Bar\u00e1nagar.**\u2014Town on the H\u00fagl\u00ed river, in the District of the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, Bengal, about a mile north of Calcutta. Formerly the seat of a Dutch factory, and during the greater part of last century Dutch vessels anchored here on their way to Chinsura. Here, says a document of that period, the Dutch Company\u2019s pigs are killed. Hence perhaps the name, from bar\u00e1ha, a pig: although one local legend connects the place with the Boar-incarnation of Vishnu, and another with a chief called after that avat\u00e1r of the god. Old Dutch tiles of artistic design are still found in some of the native architecture in the neighbourhood. Ceded by the Dutch Government to the English in 1795. Originally it is said to have been a Portuguese settlement. The town is known also as the North Suburban Municipality of Calcutta. It contained a population in 1881 of 29,982, namely, Hindus, 25,753; Muhammadans, 4144; \u2018others,\u2019 85. Area of town site, 4480 acres. Municipal income in 1880\u201381, \u00a31827; expenditure, \u00a32016. B\u00e1r\u00e1nagar is a rising town and a place of considerable trade. The river-\nside is studded with villas, the suburban residences of wealthy native gentlemen and merchants of Calcutta. Two large jute mills are worked under European supervision; but the chief article of trade is castor-oil, which is extensively manufactured in the town, and exported to Europe.\n\n**B\u00e1r\u00e1-pol\u00e9 (B\u00e1r\u00e1hol\u00e9).**\u2014River in Coorg, flowing westwards through the Madras District of Malab\u00e1r into the Arabian Sea. It rises with the Lakshmantirtha and P\u00e1pan\u00e1she in the Brahmagiri Hills in the Kiggatn\u00e1d Sub-division of Coorg, and flows for several miles in almost a straight line. Its upper course lies amid deep gorges and wild forest scenery, one of its tributaries falling over a perpendicular rock of great height, forming a beautiful cascade near the Kudi\u00e1l coffee estate. On the Coorg frontier it also forms a fine waterfall of 200 feet, which is seldom visited on account of the difficult character of the country. Its drainage area covers 192 square miles. In the District of Malab\u00e1r it is navigable from its mouth, near the village of Chir\u00e1k\u00e1l, up to 16 miles from the foot of the Gh\u00e1ts. Its chief tributary is the Kallu-hol\u00e9. On the road to Cannanore it is spanned by several bridges.\n\n**B\u00e1r\u00e1sat.**\u2014Sub-division of the District of the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, Bengal, lying between 22\u00b0 36' 45\" and 22\u00b0 57' 15\" N. lat., and between 88\u00b0 25' and 88\u00b0 48' E. long.; area, 389 square miles; number of villages, 813\u2014of houses, 50,220, of which 47,405 are occupied.

Population (1881) 7,393,954 souls. Comprises the six Districts of Bardwan, Hugli, Howrah, Midnapur, Bankura, and Birbhum (all of which see separately). It is bounded on the north by the Districts of the Sant\u00e1l Parganas and Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d, on the east by the Districts of Nadiy\u00e1 and the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, on the south by the Bay of Bengal and Balasor District, and on the west by Morbhanj State and M\u00e1nbh\u00fam and Singhbh\u00fam Districts. Number of towns and villages, 30,054; number of occupied houses, 1,467,761; unoccupied houses, 132,940; total, 1,540,661. The population consists of 6,208,208 Hindus (83.9 per cent. of total population); 957,630 Muhammadans; Sikhs, 44; Christians, 4460; Buddhists, 363; Brahmos, 28; Jains, 3; Jews, 16; Pars\u00eds, 3; and 'others,' 223,199, of whom 217,254 were Sant\u00e1ls, the remainder consisting of other unspecified aboriginal tribes.

Total rental paid by cultivators, \u00a31,989,672, including cesses, or an average of 4s. 5\u00bed. per acre of total area.\n\n**Bardw\u00e1n** (Burdwan).\u2014A British District under the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, lying between 22\u00b0 55' and 23\u00b0 53' N. lat., and between 86\u00b0 52' and 88\u00b0 30' E. long.; area, 2697 square miles. Population, according to the Census of 1881, 1,391,823 souls. It is bounded on the north by the Sant\u00e1l Parganas, and by Birbhum and Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d Districts; on the east by Nadiy\u00e1 District, the boundary line for nearly the whole distance being formed by the Bh\u00e1g\u00edrath\u00ed or H\u00fagl\u00ed river; on the south by the Districts of H\u00fagl\u00ed, Midnapur, and Bankur\u00e1; and on the west by M\u00e1nbh\u00fam.\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District is for the most part flat, and the scenery tame and uninteresting; the only exception being the north-western corner adjoining the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s, where the country is undulating and covered with jungle, which gives shelter to leopards, wolves, and other wild animals. Except in this corner of the District, the land is covered with large rice fields, and studded with little hamlets hidden among clumps of bamboos, palms, plantains, and mangoes. Large trees are scarce. The soil consists of an alluvial deposit of great depth. There are no hills in the District. The principal rivers which flow through Bardw\u00e1n are the D\u00e1modar, the Dhalkisor or Dw\u00e1rkeswar, the Khari, the B\u00e1nk\u00e1, and the Ajai, all of which eventually join the Bh\u00e1g\u00edrath\u00ed or H\u00fagl\u00ed. The D\u00e1modar marks a portion of the western boundary of the District, and the Ajai forms a natural boundary line for some distance on the north. The Bar\u00e1kh\u00e1r, too, though not properly speaking a river of Bardw\u00e1n, flows for a short distance along its north-west boundary and separates it from M\u00e1nbh\u00fam District until it falls into the D\u00e1modar. The B\u00e1nk\u00e1 rises near Bardw\u00e1n town, and flows a circuitous westerly and north-westerly course for about 60 miles. It is connected with the D\u00e1modar Canal by sluices, and supplies the Eden Canal with water throughout the year. It is also the chief source of the water supply of the town of Bardw\u00e1n. The Eden Canal, called after a late Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, is an irrigation channel, about 20 miles in length, reaching from the suburbs of Bardw\u00e1n town to Selim\u00e1b\u00e1d, at the mouth of the K\u00e1na n\u00e1di in the south of the District. A number of small tributaries of these rivers rise in and flow through the District, and a network of small creeks and watercourses intersects the country. A curious change in the course of the Bh\u00e1g\u00edrath\u00ed took place in the beginning of this century, when the stream suddenly changed its course and left the town of Nadiy\u00e1, which was formerly on the east bank, a considerable distance on the west. With this exception, no great changes have recently taken place in the river courses of this District. The towns containing a large community chiefly supported by river traffic are\u2014K\u00e1ln\u00e1 (Culna), K\u00e1tw\u00e1 (Cutwa), Dainh\u00e1t, Bhausingh, Millipur, and Uddhanpur, on the Bh\u00e1g\u00edrath\u00ed, where a large trade is carried on in salt, jute, and cloth; and Selim\u00e1b\u00e1d, B\u00e1bnab\u00e1rf, and Kasb\u00e1, on the D\u00e1modar, where the traffic consists chiefly in coal, rice, and timber. Fishing furnishes an occupation to a great number of persons on the Bh\u00e1g\u00edrath\u00ed, D\u00e1modar, and Dhalkkisor, and along the internal rivers and channels. There are no large marshy tracts in Bardw\u00e1n requiring reclamation; but it is a very common practice to embank the smaller rivers and streams, with a view to cultivation, and to the irrigation of the fields. These embankments and dams form a serious obstruction to the natural drainage of the District, and are supposed to have largely\ncontributed towards the prevalent fever among the people. The mineral products of Bardw\u00e1n consist of coal (*vide post*, p. 133, and also Raniganj), iron, red limestone, sandstone, and laterite. The principal jungle product is *tasar* silk, chiefly found in the B\u00fad-b\u00fad Sub-division, where it is collected by the aboriginal tribe of Bauris. There are no large uncultivated pasture grounds in the District, all the available land being taken up for tillage. The wild animals consist of a few tigers, bears, and wolves, found in the jungly R\u00e1n\u00edganj Sub-division. Poisonous snakes are common. Among small game, wild fowl and ducks, peacocks, hares, green pigeons, partridges and snipe are met with.\n\n**History.**\u2014Bardw\u00e1n is first mentioned in Muhammadan histories in 1574, in which year, after D\u00e1\u00fad Kh\u00e1n\u2019s defeat and death at R\u00e1jmahal, his family was captured in the town of Bardw\u00e1n by Akbar\u2019s troops. About ten years later, the District formed the scene of several engagements between Kuttu, the son of D\u00e1\u00fad Kh\u00e1n, and the imperialist forces. In 1624, Prince Kharram, afterwards the Emperor Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, captured the fort and town of Bardw\u00e1n. Soon afterwards, the founder of the Bardw\u00e1n family (Abu R\u00e1i, a Kshattriya by caste) immigrated into Bengal from the Punjab, and settled in Bardw\u00e1n. Henceforth the history of the District is identical with that of the ruling family. Abu R\u00e1i was in 1657 appointed Chaudh\u00e1r\u00ed, and afterwards became a Faujd\u00e1r or military commander under the Muhammadan Government. The estate rapidly increased in size, and Abu R\u00e1i\u2019s great-grandson, Krishna R\u00e1m R\u00e1i, obtained a *farm\u00e1n* from the Emperor Aurangzeb. It was in the reign of this Emperor (1696) that Subah Singh, a Bardw\u00e1n *tilukd\u00e1r*, raised the standard of rebellion against the Empire, and, assisted by Rah\u00edm Kh\u00e1n, an Afg\u00e1n chief, slew in battle the R\u00e1ja of Bardw\u00e1n and captured his whole family, except one son, Jagat R\u00e1m R\u00e1i. Subah Singh was stabbed by one of the R\u00e1ja\u2019s daughters, whom he attempted to outrage. Jagat R\u00e1m R\u00e1i succeeded his father, and was in turn succeeded by his son, Kirtti Chandr\u00e1 R\u00e1i, a daring and adventurous man, who largely increased the *zamin\u00e9d\u00e1r\u00ed* by adding to it the estates of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Chandrakon\u00e1, Bard\u00e1, and Balghar\u00e1, whom he dispossessed after conquering them in fight. He also attacked and defeated Badyaj\u00e1ma, the powerful R\u00e1ja of Bishnupur, with whom, however, he afterwards became reconciled.\n\nIn the beginning of the 18th century, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, after plundering the Western Districts, made their appearance in Bardw\u00e1n, encamping at K\u00e1tw\u00e1 (Cutwa), and Badyaj\u00e1ma and Jagat R\u00e1i assisted the Naw\u00e1b to drive them out. This was no easy task; and in the time of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Tilak Chandra R\u00e1i (1744\u201371), who succeeded Jagat R\u00e1i\u2019s son, the invaders, having laid waste the border principalities, overran Bardw\u00e1n. \u2018How can I relate to you,\u2019 writes the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 to the English authorities, \u2018the present deplorable situation of this place!\u2019\nThree months the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s remained here, burning, plundering, and laying waste the whole country; but now, thank God, they have all gone, but the inhabitants are not yet returned. The inhabitants have lost almost all they were worth! Grievous as was the state of affairs thus disclosed, the sufferings of Bardw\u00e1n at the hands of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s were insignificant compared with those of B\u00edrbh\u00fam, where the dry soil and fine undulating surface afforded precisely the riding-ground which their cavalry loved. The swampy nature of the country in Bardw\u00e1n protected it to a great extent, and the District would have rapidly recovered from the predatory incursions referred to, had it not been subjected to natural scourges scarcely less terrible than the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 horse. The great dearth of 1770 affected the District most disastrously. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 died in the midst of the desolation, and his heir had to melt down the household ornaments and beg a loan from Government in order to perform the funeral ceremonies. For the next twenty years, the family remained in a state of chronic debt, and the relations between the R\u00e1j\u00e1s and the English authorities were of the most troublesome and unsatisfactory character.\n\nThe Permanent Settlement (1793) brought about a new order of things, and, after a long period of poverty and ruin, Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Tej Chandra restored the financial position of the family. He was succeeded in 1833 by the late Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1, Maht\u00e1b Chand, who managed the estates with so much success that the house is now again one of the most prosperous in Bengal. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 assisted the English authorities in the Sant\u00e1l rebellion in 1855, and during the Mutiny of 1857 he did everything in his power to strengthen the hands of the Government, by placing elephants and bullock-carts at the disposal of the authorities, and keeping open the roads from Bardw\u00e1n to B\u00edrbh\u00fam and K\u00e1tw\u00e1, so that there was no interruption of intelligence between the seat of Government and the anxiously watched stations of B\u00edrbh\u00fam and Barhampur. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 died in 1879, and was succeeded by his adopted son, Aftab Chand Mahtab Chand, who, on attaining his majority at the end of 1881, was installed in all his father's honours and possessions.\n\nMany changes have taken place in the jurisdiction of the District of Bardw\u00e1n. When it was ceded to the English in 1760 by M\u00edr K\u00e1sim Kh\u00e1n, together with Midnapur and Chittagong, it comprised, in addition to the present District known as Bardw\u00e1n, those of B\u00e1nkur\u00e1 and H\u00fagl\u00ed, and a third part of B\u00edrbh\u00fam. B\u00e1nkur\u00e1 and H\u00fagl\u00ed were afterwards made separate Districts, and a number of transfers to and from the adjoining Districts were subsequently made.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The population of Bardw\u00e1n, according to the Census of 1872, but allowing for transfers since that year, which have decreased the area from 3523 to 2697 square miles, was 1,483,850. The Census of 1881 returned a total population of 1,391,823, showing a decrease of\n92,027, or 6\u00b72 per cent., in the nine years. This decrease is attributed to the ravages caused by the malarious fever known as the 'Bardw\u00e1n fever,' which has been causing great mortality in the low-lying country throughout the Bardw\u00e1n Division for the last twenty years. [For further particulars, see Medical Section, p. 135, 136.] The male population in 1881 numbered 668,295, and the female 723,528; proportion of males in the total population, 48\u00b73 per cent. Area of the District, 2697 square miles; average density of population, 516\u00b706 per square mile; number of towns and villages, 3667; villages per square mile, 1\u00b736; number of occupied houses, 289,047, with an average of 4\u00b782 inmates in each; unoccupied houses, 34,343. The great majority of the inhabitants, 1,120,676, or 80\u00b75 per cent. of the total population, are Hindus. The other religious denominations are\u2014Muhammadans, 263,816, or 18\u00b78 per cent.; Christians, 910; Jews, 3; and aboriginal Sant\u00e1ls, 6418. The higher castes of Hindus include\u2014Br\u00e1hmans, 107,684; R\u00e1jputs, 7218; and K\u00e1yasths, 33,069. The Baniy\u00e1s, or trading caste, numbers 35,305. Of the lower castes, the most numerous are the Bagd\u00ed, a degraded caste of labourers and fishermen, 148,788; and the Sadgops, the principal cultivating caste, 112,111. Of the remaining Hindu castes, the following are returned as numbering over ten thousand:\u2014Baur\u00ed, 82,254; Go\u00e1l\u00e1, 70,262; Cham\u00e1r, 49,229; Dom, 39,030; Kaibartta, 31,592; Teli, 28,978; Kalu, 22,229; Hari, 22,121; T\u00e1nti, 20,776; Loh\u00e1r, 20,601; Sunr\u00ed, 19,873; N\u00e1pit, 18,034; Chand\u00e1l, 16,887; Kumbhar, 13,045; Madak, 12,353; Barhai, 10,131. Caste-rejecting Hindus numbered 28,753, of whom 28,652 were Vaishnavs. The Muhammadan community is divided according to sect into 256,854 Sunnis and 4274 Shi\u00e1s, while 2688 are returned as unspecified. Of the 910 Christians, 311 were Europeans, 259 Eurasians, 138 natives or Asiatics, and the remainder unspecified.\n\nThe occupations of the people (males) are returned in 6 classes, as follows:\u2014(1) Professional class, including civil and military officials and the learned professions, 22,894; (2) Domestic servants, hotel and lodging-house keepers, etc., 24,035; (3) Commercial class, including merchants, general dealers, carriers, etc., 18,003; (4) Agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 255,756; (5) Manufacturing, artisan, mining, and other industrial classes, 62,429; and (6) Indefinite and unproductive (comprising 58,456 labourers, 1430 men of rank and property, and 225,292 unspecified, including male children), 285,178. There are only five towns in the District containing each more than 5000 inhabitants, and the general population is almost entirely rural. These towns are:\u2014BARDW\u00c1N (population, 34,080); KALNA, or Culna (population, 10,463); RANIGANJ (population, 10,792); KATWA, or Cutwa (population, 6820); and DAIN-HAT (population, 5789). The total urban population thus disclosed is 67,944, the balance of 1,333,879 forming the rural popula-\n\nVOL. II.\ntion. Of the 3667 villages and towns, 1554 contain less than 200 inhabitants; 1280, from 200 to 500; 622, from 500 to 1000; 182, from 1000 to 2000; 19, from 2000 to 3000; 5, from 3000 to 5000; 2, from 5000 to 10,000; 2, from 10,000 to 15,000; and 1, from 20,000 to 50,000 inhabitants.\n\nBardw\u00e1n is the principal town and civil station of the District, and was formerly the head-quarters of the Commissioner of the Division; it contains the palace and fine gardens of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja; the Sivalaya, a collection of 108 temples arranged in two circles; and the shrine of P\u00edrbaharam. The municipality of Bardw\u00e1n is composed of 93 little villages lying close to each other and surrounding the town proper. K\u00e1ln\u00e1 (Culna), the port and principal seat of trade of the District, is on the Bh\u00e1g\u00edrath\u00ed; in Muhammadan times it must have been a place of importance, as the ruins of a large fort are still to be seen; the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bardw\u00e1n has a palace here. R\u00e1niganj, on the D\u00e1modar, is principally interesting as being the centre of the coal industry of the District, an account of which will be found in another section (infra). K\u00e1tw\u00e1 (Cutwa) is situated at the confluence of the Bh\u00e1g\u00edrath\u00ed and Ajai rivers, and is one of the chief centres of trade in the District; in former times it was defended by a fort of which scarcely a vestige remains, and was regarded as the key to Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d, the capital of Bengal under the later Muhammadan governors. It was here that Chaitanya took upon himself the ascetic life, and the place is consequently considered sacred by the Vaishnavs.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The principal crop in Bardw\u00e1n, as in other Districts of Bengal, is rice. The \u00e1us or autumn crop is sown in May and reaped in August or September; and the \u00e1man or haimantik (winter) crop is sown in June or July and reaped in November or December. Aman rice requires much water, and is always sown on s\u00e1li or low-lying land, which retains more or less moisture all the time the crop is in the ground; it is always transplanted. Aus rice, on the other hand, is grown on son\u00e1 land, which is higher and therefore drier than s\u00e1li. The Eden Canal, constructed for irrigation purposes, runs for a distance of about 20 miles from Bardw\u00e1n town to Selim\u00e1b\u00e1d, in the south of the District. A scheme for clearing out the silted-up beds of old drainage channels over extensive tracts of country, is now (1883) under consideration. Among the other crops raised in the District, are wheat, barley, gram, peas, mustard, til, castor-oil, sugar-cane, mulberry, p\u00e1n, potatoes, hemp, cotton, and indigo. There are two indigo crops; the spring indigo gives the best out-turn, but the yield is very precarious, depending almost entirely on a regular alternation of sunny and showery weather during the time the plant is on the ground. Scientific irrigation is unknown in the District, but it is a common custom to dam up the lesser streams with a view to the irriga-\ntion of the neighbouring fields; and the systematic obstruction of the drainage channels by this practice is said to be one of the causes of the prevalence of the fever which devastates the District. Manure is abundantly used, and consists principally of cow-dung, tank-deposits, and oil-cake. A cultivator's holding exceeding 35 acres in extent forms a large-sized farm, while anything below 3\u00bd acres is looked upon as a very small one. A holding consisting of 10 acres of land of all descriptions, and paying a total rent of \u00a36 per annum, is a fair-sized comfortable holding for a husbandman. A peasant, with a small farm of 5 acres, is not, however, so well off as a retail shopkeeper, or a man drawing a pay of 16s. a month; a sum which affords a comfortable support for a middling-sized household. Nearly two-thirds of the husbandmen of Bardw\u00e1n District hold their lands with a right of occupancy, the remaining one-third being simple tenants-at-will. There are not many cases of small proprietors who own, occupy, and cultivate their hereditary lands without either a superior landlord above, or a sub-tenant or labourer beneath them. A fair out-turn from lands paying a rent of 18s. an acre would be 22 to 35 cwts. of unhusked paddy per acre, worth from \u00a31, 10s. to \u00a32, 8s. The rates of rent vary greatly in the different Sub-divisions of the District, as well as for the different kinds of land. The rental of son\u00e1 land, which generally gives two crops in the year, varies from 9s. an acre for fourth-class to \u00a31, 16s. per acre for first-class land; and for s\u00e1l\u00ed, or one-crop land, from 4s. 6d. for fourth-class to 18s. for first-class land. The Government assessment, including local rates and cesses levied on the land, amounted in 1881 to \u00a3338,681, or an average of 2s. 11d. per acre of total area. Total rental paid by cultivators, \u00a3552,658, or an average of 6s. 6d. per acre of total area.\n\nWages generally have much increased of late years, and especially since the railway works were commenced. Agricultural labourers now get from 12s. to \u00a31 a month, and smiths and carpenters \u00a31 to \u00a31, 10s. a month, or considerably more than double the former rates of wages. Cheapness of food does not seem to result in any corresponding fluctuation in the rates of wages; in 1871\u201372, for example, food was generally cheap, but the price of labour did not fall. The price of the best cleaned rice in that year was 8s. 10d. a cwt., and of coarse rice 4s. 5d. a cwt. In 1882, rice was cheaper than in 1871, due to two years' exceptionally good harvests. After the winter harvest in 1882, coarse rice sold at 3s. 9d., and for a time as low as 2s. 10d. a cwt. There seems to have been an increase in the prices of rice, but there are no materials previous to 1870 from which a correct estimate can be formed; the only earlier year for which there are figures is 1862, when the average price of coarse rice in Bardw\u00e1n town was 3s. 3\u00bdd. per cwt. Bardw\u00e1n District contained in 1882, 2163 recorded l\u0101khiraj or\nrent-free tenures. The service tenures of the District include nearly 200 *gh\u00e1tv\u00e1li* holdings, the nature of which is described in the article on Bankura District.\n\n**Natural Calamities.**\u2014Before the construction of the railway and the D\u00e1modar embankment, floods were common in Bardw\u00e1n; in 1770, 1823, and 1855, serious inundations occurred, causing great damage to property and loss of life. The D\u00e1modar and other embankments, which have been constructed by and are under the control of the Government, have secured for the District immunity from this calamity. Drought, occasioned by insufficient rainfall, occasionally occurs; and as until recently there was no system of artificial irrigation, and little marsh land in the District capable of being brought into cultivation in a year of drought, such a calamity was in no way provided against. The recent opening of the Eden Canal, and the proposed clearing out of old silted-up channels, will afford means of irrigation in future seasons of drought. Bardw\u00e1n suffered severely in the famine of 1866, although the generally prosperous condition of the cultivating classes enabled them to oppose a great power of resistance. In March 1866, coarse rice, which usually sells at 3s. 5d. to 5s. 10d. a cwt., was selling at 12s. 3d., and in June the price had risen to 13s. 8d. a cwt. The total amount expended on relief was \u00a31455. An equal amount was disbursed by the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1, and an additional sum of \u00a3483 was granted, and \u00a3421 advanced, for special works. The average daily number of paupers relieved (exclusive of town paupers supported by the liberality of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1) was 845 in July, 1490 in August, and 327 in September. The maximum price of common husked rice was 14s. 9d. per cwt., and of unhusked rice about half that amount.\n\n**Commerce and Trade.**\u2014The means of communication in Bardw\u00e1n, except in certain tracts bordering on H\u00fagl\u00ed and B\u00e1nkur\u00e1, are sufficient. The roads are on the whole in fairly good condition, and the East India Railway has two main lines running through the District, with stations at Mem\u00e1ri, Saktigarh, Bardw\u00e1n, K\u00e1nu Junction, M\u00e1nkur, P\u00e1n\u00e1garh, Durg\u00e1pur, And\u00e1l, R\u00e1n\u00edg\u00e1nj, Si\u00e1rsol, Nimch\u00e1, Asansol, Sit\u00e1r\u00e1mpur, Bar\u00e1khar, Gushkhar\u00e1, and Bhedi\u00e1. Several of these places, from being small villages, have developed, since the opening of the railway, into thriving centres of trade. Extensive pottery works for the manufacture of pipes, fire-bricks, tiles, etc., have been established by a large European firm in Calcutta. Although carried on for years at a loss, and amid great difficulties, Messrs. Burn & Co. have succeeded in successfully competing with imported articles of this nature. The principal native manufacture of the District is the weaving of silk *s\u00e1ris* and *dh\u00fatis*; there is also a considerable number of workers in gold, silver, and brass. The local manufactures as well as the District crops, are more than sufficient to meet the demand of the local\nmarkets, and are largely exported. The chief articles of export are rice, tobacco, pulses of all kinds, wheat, rape-seed, oil-cake, jute, sugar, salt, English and country-made cloth, cotton, etc.; the principal imports consist of English piece-goods, manufactured iron, salt, spices, cocoa-nuts, and castor-oil.\n\nCoal.\u2014The R\u00e1n\u00edganj Sub-division of Bardw\u00e1n District is noted for its coal mines, of which the principal, worked in 1881, are at R\u00e1n\u00edganj, Madhabpur, S\u00e1nkhtaria, Dhos\u00e1l, Ni\u00e1matpur, Desagarh, Mangalpur, Dh\u00e1dk\u00e1, Belrui, Baria, Si\u00e1rsol, Charanpur, Lakhipur, Sibpur, and Jot Janaki. Most of these belong to companies which have their head offices at Calcutta. A full account of this industry will be found in the article on RANIGANJ. The coal-field extends from a few miles east of the town of R\u00e1n\u00edganj to several miles west of the Bar\u00e1kh\u00e1r river, the greatest length from east to west being about 30 miles, and the greatest breadth from north to south about 18 miles. The area included by the coal-bearing strata is estimated at about 500 square miles. The mineral is described as \u2018a non-coking bituminous coal, composed of distinct laminae of a bright jetty coal and of a dull, more earthy rock.\u2019 The average amount of ash is from 14 to 15 per cent., varying from 8 to 25 per cent.\n\nThe miners are chiefly semi-aboriginal or aboriginal castes, such as Baur\u00eds or Sant\u00e1ls, but low-caste Hindus and the poorer class of Muhammadans also work in the collieries. Their pay is high, and even in 1860 a miner\u2019s family, consisting of a man and his wife with three children, earned 18s. or even more a month, being about double the wage of an ordinary peasant or day-labourer at present. In 1881, there were altogether 37 coal mines at work in the District, of which 17 turned out upwards of 10,000 tons each per annum. The greatest out-turn was in 1868, when 564,933 tons were raised, but this is above the average. In 1880, the out-turn from 47 mines was 525,472 tons; in 1881, the trade was in a somewhat depressed state, and the output fell to 442,933 tons from 37 mines. The chief objections to the employment of R\u00e1n\u00edganj coal in India are\u2014(1) its non-coking property; (2) the small proportion it contains of fixed carbon, on which the value of coal for heating purposes depends; (3) the large proportion of ash, a greater quantity of R\u00e1n\u00edganj coal being required to do the same work as good English coal; and (4) its liability to spontaneous combustion, due to the large proportion of iron pyrites it contains.\n\nIt has been proved practically that no Indian coal can do more than two-thirds, while most of it does not do more than one-half, the work of English coal. The present price of R\u00e1n\u00edganj coal varies from \u00a31, 2s. 3d. to \u00a31, 5s. 7d. a ton in Calcutta. The question of its suitability for blast furnaces, for the manufacture of iron from the rich\nclay iron and deposits of magnetic iron which abound in the neighbourhood, has not yet been settled; one of the principal drawbacks is the great scarcity of flux. The whole matter, however, is too extensive to be noticed in a short article, and the reader is referred to vol. iv. of the Statistical Account of Bengal (pp. 107-133) for a full discussion of the subject, which is of very great importance and seriously affects the future of R\u00e1niganj.\n\nAdministration.\u2014It is impossible to compare in a satisfactory manner the revenue and expenditure of the District at different periods, because of the numerous and important changes which have taken place in the constitution and area of the District since its cession to the Company in 1760. In 1870-71, the total net revenue of the District from all sources amounted to \u00a3388,773, and the net civil expenditure to \u00a364,435. Since then, although the area of the District has been materially reduced by transfers to and from H\u00fagl\u00ed, B\u00e1nkur\u00e1, and M\u00e1nbh\u00fam Districts, in 1881-82 the total revenue amounted to \u00a3381,077. The total land revenue in 1760 was returned at \u00a3243,891; in 1881, it amounted to \u00a3303,870, equal to an average payment of \u00a362 by each of the 4925 estates, or \u00a348 by each of the 6352 individual proprietors or coparceners. The police of the District, at the end of 1880, consisted of a regular police force of 2 superior and 75 subordinate officers, and 312 constables, maintained at a cost of \u00a37982; a municipal force of 12 officers and 213 men, costing \u00a31995; and a village watch of 11,861 men, maintained (by grants of land, and in some cases also by money contributions from the villagers) at an estimated cost of \u00a324,851: total police force of all kinds, 12,475 officers and men, equal to an average of one man to every 109 of the population, maintained at an aggregate cost of \u00a334,828, equal to 6d. per head of the population.\n\nThere are 17 th\u00e1ns or police stations in the District. The total number of police cases, 'cognisable' and 'non-cognisable,' instituted during the year, was 5727, in which 3213 persons were convicted. There are 4 jails in the District; the average daily number of prisoners was, in 1881, 136, or 1 person always in jail to every 10,234 of the population. The educational statistics show that much progress has been made during the last few years. In 1856-57, the District as then constituted contained 23 schools, with 1681 pupils; in 1870-71, the number of schools was 305, and of pupils 12,855; the total cost of Government and aided schools in the former year was \u00a3915, and in the latter \u00a310,630. By 1880-81, the number of aided primary schools alone, under the supervision of the Education Department, amounted to 1228, attended by 36,284 pupils. The unaided inspected schools numbered 31, with 1022 pupils. The unaided schools, not yet under Departmental supervision, were returned\nat 428. Besides these, there were in the same year six primary girls' schools, containing 97 pupils. On the 31st March 1882, there were altogether 1511 inspected schools of all classes, with an attendance of 45,442 pupils. For administrative purposes Bardw\u00e1n District is divided into 4 Sub-divisions and 17 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00eds) as follows, namely:\u2014(1) the Sadr or head-quarters Sub-division, comprising the 8 police circles of Bardw\u00e1n, S\u00e1hibganj, Khandghosh, Raon\u00e1, Gangur, Selim\u00e1b\u00e1d, Bud-Bud, and Ausgr\u00e1m; (2) R\u00e1n\u00edganj, comprising the 3 police circles of R\u00e1n\u00edganj, Asansol, and Kaks\u00e1; (3) K\u00e1tw\u00e1 (Cutwa), comprising the three police circles of K\u00e1tw\u00e1, Ketugr\u00e1m, and Mangalkot; and (4) K\u00e1ln\u00e1 (Culna), with the three police circles of K\u00e1ln\u00e1, Purbasthali, and Mantreswar. These, again, are sub-divided into 71 fiscal divisions (pargan\u00e1s). The gross municipal income of the 5 municipalities in the District in 1881\u201382 was \u00a38683; expenditure, \u00a38420; average rate of municipal taxation, 2s. 6\u00bdd. per head.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The average annual temperature of Bardw\u00e1n is 81\u00b0 F., and the annual rainfall, 60\u00b731 inches. Since 1866, the District has suffered very seriously from the ravages of malarious endemic fever. The disease seems to have first attracted notice about 1824 in Jessor District, whence it has gradually extended in a north-westerly direction through Nadiy\u00e1, the Twenty-four Parganas, and H\u00fagl\u00ed, until, in 1863, it made its first appearance in the south-east of Bardw\u00e1n District. In 1866 and the three following years it raged with great severity, but with varying intensity in different parts of the District. In the high-lying northern tracts, where the formation is laterite, there has been very little fever, but in the lower and purely alluvial tracts, there has been an enormous decrease in the population between 1872 and 1881, due to the ravages of this fever. It is described as 'an exaggerated and congestive form of malarious fever, most frequently of the intermittent type, generally assuming the most intense and asthenic character in localities where the recognised predisposing causes of the disease preponderate most.' The nature of the country, namely, a badly-drained, water-logged alluvial tract, and the character and sequel of the fever, leave no room for doubt as to its malarious origin. For six months of the year, from February to July, when the soil is dry, the District is healthy and fever uncommon. During the rainy season from June to September, the country is submerged, and with the drying up of the water, which commences in October, the fever breaks out and lasts until the following February. The insanitary habits of the people, their spare diet, bad water-supply and scanty clothing, combine to render them liable to attacks of fever.\n\nIn some years, the disease prevails in a virulent epidemic form. Many different causes have been assigned for the increased severity\nof the fever of late years, some supposing it to result from the interference with the natural drainage of the country by river and railway embankments, by changes in the courses of the large rivers, and by the silting and drying up of the channels of the small streams; while others attribute it to the drinking water, or defective sanitation, etc.; and others, again, believe that some influence is at work, the operation of which is not fully understood. Be the cause of the fever what it may, there is no doubt that with improved drainage, a better water-supply, and the spread of sanitary knowledge among the people, the ravages of the fever will abate. Attention is now being bestowed on all these points by the Municipalities and District officers. Schemes for a water-supply to the municipal towns are under consideration, and the Eden Canal supplies pure water from the D\u00e1modar to a large tract of country which hitherto depended entirely upon polluted tanks. The silted-up beds of old drainage channels are also to be cleared. The fever at present (1883) is very much less than ten years ago, and at least further improvement may be anticipated year by year.

Population (1881) 639,593, namely, 500,007 Hindus (or 78.1 per cent. of the Sub-divisional population), 139,445 Muhammadans, and 141 Christians. Average density of population, 515 per square mile; villages per square mile, 1.39; persons per village, 370; houses per square mile, 119.71; persons per occupied house, 4.89. The Sub-division contains the 8 th\u00e1n\u00e1s (police circles) of Bardw\u00e1n, Sahibganj, Khandgosh, Raona, Gang\u00far, Bud-B\u00fad, and Ausgr\u00e1m. In 1882 there were 17 magisterial and revenue courts; and the total police force consisted of 6612 men, including village watch. The separate cost of Sub-divisional administration was returned at \u00a35137.\n\n**Bardw\u00e1n.**\u2014Principal town and civil station of the District of the same name, situated on the B\u00e1nk\u00e1 n\u00e1di. Lat. $23^\\circ 14' 10''$ N., long. $87^\\circ 53' 55''$ E. Population in 1872, 32,321; in 1881, 34,080, namely, 23,683 Hindus, 10,263 Muhammadans, and 134 \u2018others.\u2019 Municipal revenue in 1881\u201382, \u00a35731; expenditure, \u00a35669; average rate of taxation, 2s. 5\u00bdd. per head of municipal population. The town\nhas suffered very severely from the fever which has been ravaging the District since 1863, and of which an account will be found in the article on Bardwan District. The principal buildings in the town are the palace of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1, a fine large edifice, many of the apartments in which are furnished in European fashion; the Sivalay\u00e1, a collection of 108 temples arranged in two circles, one within the other; and the shrine of P\u00edrbaharam. The town figures more than once in history, having been captured by Prince Kharram (afterwards the Emperor Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n) in 1624, and again in 1695 by the Hindu rebel Subah Singh, who slew the R\u00e1j\u00e1, and was soon afterwards himself killed by the R\u00e1j\u00e1's daughter, whom he attempted to outrage. There is a station of the East Indian Railway at Bardw\u00e1n; distance from Calcutta, 67 miles.\n\n**Bardw\u00e1r.**\u2014Forest reserve in the south of K\u00e1mr\u00fap District, Assam Province; bounded on the west by the Kulsi river. The trees are chiefly sal (Shorea robusta). There is a second forest reserve to the north. Total area of the two tracts, 25'40 square miles.\n\n**Bareilly (Bareli).**\u2014District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the North-Western Provinces, lying between 28\u00b0 3' and 28\u00b0 54' N. lat., and between 79\u00b0 3' and 79\u00b0 50' E. long.; area, 1614 square miles. Population in 1881, 1,030,936 souls. Bareilly is a District of the Rohilkhand Division, and is bounded on the north by the Tar\u00e1i District; on the east by the new District of Pilibhit; on the south by Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur and Bud\u00e1un Districts; and on the west by Bud\u00e1un and R\u00e1mpur State. The administrative head-quarters are at the town of Bareilly (Bareli).\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014The District of Bareilly, though lying just below the last slopes of the Him\u00e1layas, forms itself a level plain, with no greater variety of surface than that caused by the shifting channels of its numerous streams. Hills or natural elevations nowhere break the general level, but the distinctions of upland and lowland are well marked, and the intervening terraces are everywhere conspicuous. The largest alluvial plain is that of the R\u00e1mgang\u00e1, which reaches in one place a width of 16 miles. Over the whole of this broad valley, the river has wandered at various times, fertilizing the land through which it passed with rich deposits of vegetable mould. The difference in height between the lowlands and the central plain ranges from 10 to 25 feet; while the general elevation of the country rises gradually from 520 feet above sea-level in the extreme south, near Fatehganj, to 658 feet on the farthest northern boundary, just beneath the Tar\u00e1i. The upland does not consist of a dead flat, but is composed of gentle undulations, occasionally rising into rolling sandhills. As a whole, however, the District may be described as a level tract, intersected by numerous rivers and thickly dotted with noble groves, which form\nthe characteristic feature of the landscape. Almost every village possesses an abundant supply of mango and shisham trees, while many have beautiful plantations of bamboos. In seasons of drought elsewhere, the kh\u00e1dar or alluvial tract of Bareilly is clothed with magnificent crops. Inundations do more good than harm, by destroying the white ants and depositing layers of fresh soil, which supply the place of manure.\n\nThe District is naturally traversed by several sub-Him\u00e1layan streams, of which the chief are the R\u00e1mgang\u00e1 and the Baigul. The former river has deep and well-defined banks, but frequently changes its course through the friable alluvial channel in which it runs. Some twenty years since, the main stream passed below Gaini, 10 miles west of the city; then it cut itself a path into the Dojora, and ran beneath the outskirts of Bareilly; and during the rains of 1871, it once more returned to its ancient bed. The other principal streams are the Nakatia, the Dioranian, the Sanka, the Dojora, the Kicha, and the Arail, many of which are used for purposes of irrigation.\n\nHistory.\u2014In the earliest times, the country east of the Ganges, now known as Rohilkhand, bore the general name of Kather; but when Sambhal and Bud\u00e1un were erected into separate governments by the Musalm\u00e1ns, this term was restricted to the territory lying east of the R\u00e1mgang\u00e1. A highly civilised Aryan race appears to have occupied the tract from the 8th to the 11th century, when they were probably driven out by Ah\u00edrs from the Nep\u00e1l Hills, Bhils from the jungles to the south, and Bhars from the forests of Oudh, during the general expulsion of the Aryan settlers from the sub-Him\u00e1layan border. About 1200 A.D. the greater part of the District had relapsed into forest; but large primitive bricks, fragments of Buddhist sculpture, and other evidences of ancient prosperity still lie scattered about the country, especially in the neighbourhood of Fatehgarh and R\u00e1mnagar. Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn, or his general Kutb-ud-d\u00edn, captured Bangarh about the year 1194; but nothing more is heard of the Muhammadans in the District till Mahm\u00fad II. made his way along the foot of the hills to the R\u00e1mgang\u00e1 in 1252. Fourteen years later, Balban, who succeeded him, marched to Kampil, put all the Hindus to the sword, and utterly crushed the Katheriyas, who had hitherto lived by violence and plunder. In 1290, Sult\u00e1n Firoz invaded Kather again, and brought the country into final subjection to the Musalm\u00e1n rule, which was not afterwards disputed except by the usual local revolts. Under the various dynasties which preceded the Mughal Empire, the history of Kather consists of the common events which make up the annals of that period\u2014constant attempts at independence on the part of the District governors, followed by barbarous suppressions on the part of the central authority. The city of Bareilly itself was founded in 1537 by Bas Deo and Barel Deo, from the latter of whom\nit takes its name. In 1628, Ali Kuli Kh\u00e1n was governor of Bareilly, which had now grown into a considerable place. In 1657, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Makrand R\u00e1i founded the new city of Bareilly, cut down the forest to the west of the old town, and expelled all the Katheriyas from the neighbourhood.\n\nA succession of regular governors followed during the palmy days of the great Mughal Emperors; but after the death of Aurangzeb, in 1707, when the unwieldy organization began to break asunder, the Hindus of Bareilly threw off the imperial yoke, refused their tribute, and commenced a series of anarchic quarrels among themselves for the supremacy of the District. Their dissensions only afforded an opportunity for the rise of a new Muhammadan power. Ali Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, a leader of Rohill\u00e1 Path\u00e1ns, defeated the governors of Bareilly and Morad\u00e1b\u00e1d, and made himself supreme throughout the whole Kather region. In 1744 the Rohill\u00e1 chieftain conquered Kum\u00e1un right up to Almora; but two years later, the Emperor Muhammad Sh\u00e1h marched against him, and Ali Muhammad was taken a prisoner to Delhi. However, the Empire was too much in need of vigorous generals to make his captivity a long one, and in 1750 he was restored to his old post in Kather. Next year he died, and a mausoleum at Aonla, in this District, still marks his burial-place. H\u00e1f\u00edz Rahmat Kh\u00e1n, guardian to his sons, succeeded to the governorship of Rohilkhand, in spite of the opposition of the Emperor, who despatched the Naw\u00e1b of Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d against him without effect. H\u00e1f\u00edz defeated and slew the Naw\u00e1b, after which he marched northward and conquered Pilibhit and the Tar\u00e1i. The Oudh Waz\u00edr, Safdar Jang, plundered the property of the Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d Naw\u00e1b after his death, and this led to a union of the Rohill\u00e1 Afgh\u00e1ns with those of Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d. H\u00e1f\u00edz defeated Safdar Jang, besieged Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, and took part of Oudh; but the Waz\u00edr called in the aid of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and with them defeated the Rohill\u00e1s at Bisauli, near Aonla. He then besieged them for four months at the foot of the hills; but owing to the invasion of Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Dur\u00e1n\u00ed terms were arranged, and H\u00e1f\u00edz was made governor of Pilibhit.\n\nAfter the accession of Shuj\u00e1-ud-daul\u00e1 as Waz\u00edr of Oudh, H\u00e1f\u00edz joined the imperial troops in their attack upon that prince, but the Waz\u00edr bought them off by a subsidy of 5 l\u00e1khs. The Rohill\u00e1 chieftain took advantage of Ahmad Sh\u00e1h\u2019s inroad into the Do\u00e1b to make himself master of Et\u00e1wah, and during the eventful years in which Shuj\u00e1-ud-daul\u00e1 was engaged in his struggle with the British power, he continually strengthened himself by fortifying his towns and founding new strongholds. In 1770, Najib-ud-daul\u00e1 advanced with the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 army under Sindhia and Holkar, defeated H\u00e1f\u00edz and Z\u00e1bita Kh\u00e1n, and forced the Rohill\u00e1s to ask the aid of the Waz\u00edr. Shuj\u00e1-ud-daul\u00e1 became surety\nfor a bond of 40 l\u0101khs, by which the Mar\u0101th\u0101s were induced to evacuate Rohilkhand. This bond the Rohill\u0101s were unable to meet, whereupon Shuj\u00e1-ud-daul\u00e1, after getting rid of the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, attacked Rohilkhand with the help of an English force lent by Warren Hastings, and subjugated it by a desolating war. H\u00e1fiz Rahmat was slain, but Faiz-ull\u00e1, the son of Ali Muhammed, escaped to the north-west and became the leader of the Rohill\u0101s. After many negotiations he effected a treaty with Shuj\u00e1-ud-daul\u00e1 in 1774, by which he agreed to keep 9 parganas and 15 l\u0101khs a year, giving up all the remainder of Rohilkhand to the Wazir (see Rampur). Sa\u00e1dat Ali was appointed governor of Bareilly under the Oudh Government. The District remained in the hands of the Waz\u00edr until 1801, when Rohilkhand, Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, and Korah were ceded to the British in lieu of tribute.\n\nMr. Henry Wellesley, brother of the Governor-General, was appointed President of the Board of Commissioners sitting at Bareilly. In 1805, Amir Kh\u00e1n, a Rohill\u00e1 adventurer, made an inroad into Rohilkhand, but was driven off. Disturbances occurred in 1816, in 1837, and in 1842, but the peace of the District was not seriously endangered until the Mutiny of 1857. In that year, the troops at Bareilly rose on the 31st of May. The European officers, except three, escaped to Naini T\u00e1l; and Kh\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n, H\u00e1fiz Rahmat's grandson, was proclaimed Naw\u00e1b N\u00e1zim of Rohilkhand. On the 11th of June, the mutinous soldiery went off to Delhi, and Kh\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur organized a government in July. Three expeditions attempted to attack Naini T\u00e1l, but without success. At the beginning of November came news of the fall of Delhi. Walid\u00e1d Kh\u00e1n, the rebel leader in Bulandshahr, and the Naw\u00e1b of Fatehgarh then took refuge at Bareilly. A fourth expedition against Naini T\u00e1l met with no greater success than the earlier attempts. On the 25th of March 1858, the N\u00e1n\u00e1 S\u00e1hib arrived at Bareilly on his flight from Oudh, and remained till the end of April; but when the commander-in-chief marched on Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d he fled back again into Oudh. On the fall of Lucknow, Firoz Sh\u00e1h retired to Bareilly, and took Mor\u00e1d\u00e1b\u00e1d on the 22nd of April, but was compelled to give it up again at once. The Naw\u00e1b of Najib\u00e1b\u00e1d, leader of the Bijnaur rebels, joined him in the city, so that the principal insurgents were congregated together in Bareilly when the English army arrived on the 5th of May. The city was taken on the 7th, and all the chiefs fled with Kh\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur into Oudh.\n\nPopulation.\u2014An enumeration in 1853 returned the number of inhabitants in Bareilly District at 1,316,830. The Census of 1872 returned the population on an area of 2982 square miles at 1,507,139, or after allowing for the diminished area caused by the creation of Pilibhit into a separate District, 1,015,041. The latest Census in 1881 returned a total population of 1,030,936, showing an increase of\n15,895, or 1.54 per cent., upon the corresponding area in 1872. The male population in 1881 numbered 548,010, and the female 482,926; proportion of males in total population, 53.16 per cent. Total area of District, 1614.3 square miles; number of towns and villages, 1928; number of occupied houses, 119,935; average density of population, 638.6; number of villages per square mile, 1.19; houses per village, 74.2; inmates per house, 8.5. Classified according to religion, Hindus numbered 790,309, or 76.6 per cent.; Musalmans, 237,996, or 23.0 per cent.; Christians numbered 2393; Sikhs, 207; Buddhists, 15; and Parsis, 16. The agricultural population amounted to 715,785 persons, or 69.43 per cent. The principal castes are returned as follows:\u2014Br\u00e1hmans, 48,871; R\u00e1jputs, 35,340; Baniy\u00e1s, 23,151; Ahirs, 47,366; Cham\u00e1rs, 93,891; Kachhis, 72,312; Kah\u00e1rs, 48,751; K\u00e1yasths, 17,349; and K\u00farm\u00eds, 190,560. The other Hindu castes include\u2014Barhai, 19,243; Tel\u00ed, 18,117; Dhob\u00ed, 17,493; Bhangi, 16,119; Gad\u00e1ri\u00e1, 15,458; Nai, 14,844; Kor\u00ed, 11,388; Kumbhar, 10,295; J\u00e1t, 9312; G\u00fajar, 7811; Son\u00e1r, 7160; Loh\u00e1r, 5548; and Lodh\u00ed, 4746. The Musalmans are divided into 235,379 Sunnis and 2617 Shi\u00e1s. The Christians include 1527 Europeans, 125 Eurasians, and 741 natives. The best cultivators in Bareilly are the K\u00farm\u00eds, Lodhis, Murais, Cham\u00e1rs, and J\u00e1ts. The District contained in 1881 four towns with a population exceeding 5000\u2014namely, Bareilly including Civil Station and Cantonment, 113,417; Aonla, 13,018; Faridpur, 5881; and Siraul\u00ed Pias, 6542. The 1928 villages are classified as follows:\u2014With less than two hundred inhabitants, 528; from two to five hundred, 789; from five hundred to a thousand, 444; from one to two thousand, 132; with from two to three thousand, 25; from three to five thousand, 6; from five to ten thousand, 2; with upwards of ten thousand, 2. A few ruined forts are scattered over the face of the country, but none of any military strength. The houses in villages have roofs of mud; in larger towns they are generally tiled, being often built of two storeys around an open courtyard; in the north, along the Tar\u00e1i, some of the houses are supported on pillars, as the water in that tract approaches very near the surface of the ground. Relics of early Aryan buildings are found near R\u00e1mnagar, identified by General Cunningham with Ahichhatra, the capital of the great Panchala Des, a kingdom which stretched from the Him\u00e1layas to the Chambal. Similar ruins are found at Galoria, Devala, Lilaur, and elsewhere in the District. As regards occupation, the Census Report of 1881 returns the male population under the six following main classes:\u2014(1) Professional class, including civil and military, all Government officials, and the learned professions, 10,577; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, 3332; (3) commercial class, including merchants, traders, and carriers, 8537; (4) agricultural and\npastoral class, 261,320; (5) manufacturing and industrial class, 60,812; \n(6) indefinite and non-productive (including 20,265 general labourers, \nand 179,909 male children, and unspecified), 200,174.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The soil of Bareilly is divided into upland and lowland, \nthe latter consisting chiefly of the alluvial basins watered by the rivers \nDioranian, Nakalia, Dogora, Baigul, and Ramganga. Some of these \nlow-lying tracts are covered twice a year by rich crops of wheat and \nsugar-cane; others, more sandy and less fertile, produce only a single \ncrop of linseed or melons. The higher levels of the alluvial region are \nusually the most productive, as the inundations deposit their fine silt \nand vegetable mould at a distance from the central channels, while \nnearer the main stream, sand and shingle render cultivation comparatively \nfruitless. The harvests are those common to the rest of Upper India. \nThe kharif or autumn crops are sown after the first rain in June, and \ngathered in October or November; early rice may even be harvested at \nthe end of August, but cotton is not ripe for picking till February. The \nother autumn staples are joar, bajra, moth, and inferior food-grains. The \nspring crops are sown in October or November, and reaped in March \nor April; they consist of wheat, barley, oats, and pulses. Manure is \nused, where it can be obtained, for both crops; and land is allowed to \nlie fallow whenever the cultivator can afford it. Owing to the abundant \nrainfall, and the regularity of the Christmas showers, combined with \nthe nearness of water to the surface, irrigation is not so necessary as in \nthe Doab. Moreover, as rents are often paid in kind by fixed propor-\ntions, it is asserted that the cultivators will not take the trouble to \nirrigate, when they know that they must share the resulting profit with \ntheir landlord. Out of 761,734 acres of cultivated land in the District \nin 1881, 61,414 were cultivated by the owners; 513,392 acres were \nheld by tenants with rights of occupancy; and 186,928 acres by \ntenants-at-will.\n\nMoney rents are usual in all the southern parganas, ranging from \n5s. 5\u00bdd. to 11s. 3\u00bdd. per acre, according to situation; but towards the \nnorth, rents are paid in kind. The total number of adult male \nagriculturists in 1881 was returned at 261,320, cultivating an average \nof 2\u00b791 acres each. The total population, however, wholly dependent \non the soil numbered 715,785, or 69\u00b743 per cent. of the District \npopulation. Of the total District area of 1614 square miles, 1523 \nsquare miles are assessed for Government revenue, of which 1127 are \nactually under cultivation, and 381 cultivable, the remainder being \nuncultivable waste. Total amount of Government assessment, including \ncesses and rates levied on the land, \u00a3159,521, or an average of \n4s. 4\u00bdd. per cultivated acre; total rental paid by cultivators, including \ncesses, \u00a3281,933, or an average of 7s. 4\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. The \nfollowing are the ordinary rates of wages:\u2014Coolies and unskilled\nlabourers, $2\\frac{1}{4}$d. to $3\\frac{3}{4}$d. per diem; agricultural labourers, $2\\frac{1}{4}$d. to 3d. per diem; bricklayers and carpenters, 6d. to 2s. per diem. Women receive about one-fifth less than men, while children earn from one-third to one-half the wages of adults. Prices have steadily increased since the beginning of the century. In 1876, the ordinary food-grains sold as follows:\u2014Wheat, 24 sers per rupee, or 4s. 8d. per cwt.; best rice, 7 sers per rupee, or 16s. per cwt.; jo\u00e1r, 32 sers per rupee, or 3s. 6d. per cwt.; b\u00e1jr\u00e1, 30 sers per rupee, or 3s. 9d. per cwt. In 1881\u201382, the average prices of food-grains were for wheat $18\\frac{1}{2}$ sers per rupee, or 6s. 1d. per cwt.; best rice, $7\\frac{1}{2}$ sers per rupee, or 15s. per cwt.; common rice, $15\\frac{1}{2}$ sers per rupee, or 7s. 3d. per cwt.; jo\u00e1r, $23\\frac{3}{4}$ sers per rupee, or 4s. 8\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d. per cwt.; and b\u00e1jr\u00e1, $22\\frac{1}{5}$ sers per rupee, or 5s. per cwt.\n\n**Natural Calamities.**\u2014Nothing is known of the scarcities which occurred in Rohilkhand during the last century, though the Muhammadan historians occasionally mention that after long-continued struggles between the Katheriyas and the Musalm\u00e1ns, or protracted wars of the Afgh\u00e1ns against the Imperial troops, much land had fallen out of cultivation, and little grain was left in the country. The great famine of 1783 found Bareilly under the rule of the Waz\u00edrs of Oudh, who did nothing to mitigate its severity, but the distress never seriously affected Rohilkhand. In the famine year of 1803, Bareilly had but recently passed under the British Government. Very little rain fell during the autumn, and all the crops failed; disturbances arose, and the landlords, unable to pay their share of the revenue, absconded in numbers. The distress reached its height in April, when the people fed their starving cattle on the dried-up stalks of the spring crops. In 1837\u201338, the year of the terrible famine in the Do\u00e1b, Rohilkhand suffered somewhat for lack of rain; but opportune showers in February 1838 saved a large proportion of the rabi harvest. The scarcity of 1860\u201361 was severely felt throughout Rohilkhand, and this District did not escape unhurt. The road from Bareilly to Bud\u00e1un was constructed as a relief work. Crowds of starving immigrants from the westward poured into the District, aggravating the local distress, which would not otherwise have reached a conspicuous height. Bareilly was only slightly affected by the dearth of 1868\u201369. As a whole, owing to the abundant natural water supply of the sub-Him\u00e1layan tract, the extremity of famine need not be apprehended so seriously for this District as for many others in its neighbourhood.\n\n**Commerce and Trade, etc.**\u2014The leading marts in the District are those of Bareilly and Aonla; but as many as 173 village b\u00e1z\u00e1s are scattered through the country pargan\u00e1s. They are usually held twice a week, and serve to carry off the cotton and grain of the surrounding country, which is bought up by Banj\u00e1ras for the markets of Bareilly, Pilibh\u00edt, R\u00e1mpur, and Chandausi. The villagers obtain their supplies\nof cloth, metal pots, and pedlar's wares at the same time. Landlords levy a small tax from each shopkeeper, pedlar, or grain seller at these bazaars. Bareilly has no manufactures of more than local importance, and very little external trade. The Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway passes through the south-western portion of the District for a distance of 47.75 miles, with stations at Fatehganj, Faridpur, Bareilly, Basharatganj, and Aonla. Good bridged and metalled roads connect Bareilly with Fatehgarh, Moradabad, Budauun, and Pilibhit. A metalled road also runs to the foot of the hills for Naini Tal. The northern part of the District is badly supplied with communications, owing to the scarcity of road metal, and the number of Himalayan torrents which cut their way through the soft soil. Total length of roads, 525 miles.\n\nAdministration.\u2014On the cession of Rohilkhand to the British in 1801, the Province was divided into two Districts\u2014Bareilly and Moradabad. In 1813, Shahjahapur was made a distinct District; and in 1821 Budauun was similarly separated. In 1817, Bijnor was divided from Moradabad, and in 1858 the Tarai from Bareilly. Subsequently, in 1880\u201381, the area of Bareilly was further reduced by the separation from it of the new District of Pilibhit. In this way the seven Districts now constituting the Rohilkhand Division were formed. In 1861, the Nawab of Rampur received a grant of 133 villages as a reward for his services during the Mutiny. The District, as at present constituted, is administered by a magistrate-collector, 2 joint or assistant-magistrates, and 2 deputy-magistrates, besides the ordinary medical, fiscal, and constabulary establishments. Total District revenue, 1881\u201382, \u00a3134,062, equal to an average of 2s. 7d. per head on a population of 1,030,936.\n\nIn 1881, the regular police force amounted to 1006 officers and men, maintained at a cost of \u00a311,364. These figures show one policeman to every 1.60 square miles of area and every 1024 of the population; the cost of maintenance was at the rate of \u00a36, 1s. per square mile, or 2\u00bdd. per head of the population. Bareilly contains three places of confinement, the Central and the District jails, and a lock-up. The former had in 1881 a daily average of 1956 prisoners. Criminals from all Districts in the Rohilkhand Division undergo confinement in this prison. The District jail contained in the same year a daily average of 896 prisoners, of whom 787 were males and 109 females. The average daily prison population in the Sub-divisional lock-up numbered 41. There are 21 post-offices in the District, and the telegraph is in operation along the line of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway. In 1881, the educational machinery consisted of 121 schools under Government inspection, with an aggregate roll of 4620 pupils, giving an average area of 13.34 square miles.\nfor each school, and 4\u00b75 scholars per thousand of the population. Female education is carried on by 7 schools, one of which is of a high class. For fiscal and administrative purposes, Bareilly is divided into 6 tahsils and 14 parganas, with 3832 separate estates. The District contains only one municipality, that of Bareilly.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of the District is largely influenced by its proximity to the hills, Bareilly city and all the northern parganas lying within the limits of the heavier storms. The rainy season begins a little earlier, and ends a little later, than elsewhere to the south, and the cold weather lasts longer. The atmosphere is damp, the heat moderate, and the hot winds not excessive. The average annual mean temperature at Bareilly town for the 13 years ending 1880 was 74\u00b79\u00b0, reaching a maximum of 89\u00b75\u00b0 in June, and a minimum of 56\u00b79\u00b0 in January. The average annual rainfall for the 32 years ending 1881 amounted to 40\u00b797 inches; the maximum during this period was 62\u00b78 inches, in 1867, and the minimum 19\u00b77 inches, in 1860. In 1881, the rainfall at Bareilly was 2\u00b762 inches below the average. The total number of deaths recorded in the year 1880 was 26,536, or 25\u00b774 per thousand of the population; the average death-rate for the previous 6 years was returned as 20\u00b794 per thousand. The District contains 4 dispensaries\u20142 in the city of Bareilly, and 1 each at Aonla and Baheri. In 1881 they afforded relief to a total of 59,780 patients. [For further information regarding Bareilly, see the Settlement Report of the District (1874), by S. M. Moens, Esq., C.S.; the Gazetteer of the North-Western Provinces, by H. C. Conybeare, Esq., C.S., and E. T. Atkinson, Esq., C.S., vol. v. pp. 499\u2013675 (Allahabad, 1879); the North-Western Provinces Census Report for 1881; and the Provincial Administration Reports for 1880 to 1882.]\n\nBareilly (Bareli).\u2014City in Bareilly District, North-Western Provinces, and administrative head-quarters of the District and also of the Rohilkhand Division. Lat. 28\u00b0 22' 9\" N., long. 29\u00b0 26' 38\" E. Population in 1881, 103,160, namely, 56,550 Hindus, 45,877 Muhammadans, 720 Christians, and 13 'others.' Bareilly is the most populous city in Rohilkhand, and fifth in the North-Western Provinces. It stands at an elevation of 550 feet above sea-level, on the R\u00e1mgang\u00e1 river, 96 miles above its confluence with the Ganges; distant from Calcutta 788 miles north-west, and from Delhi 152 miles east. Good metalled roads connect the city with all the neighbouring centres of trade and population; and the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway affords access from Lucknow and Bengal on the east, and from the Do\u00e1b on the west. The city, civil station, and cantonments lie on an open plain without walls or fortifications, intersected by a few ravines and patches of broken ground. The cantonments contain lines for a battery of artillery and regiments of European and native infantry, besides native\ncavalry. Bareilly forms the head-quarters of the Rohilkhand Military District. The population of the cantonments as distinguished from the town population, consists of 10,257, namely, 6339 Hindus, 2272 Muhammadans, 1430 Christians, and 216 'others.' The ordinary military force includes a regiment each of European and Native infantry, a battery of Royal Artillery, and a regiment of Native cavalry, the whole under the command of a Brigadier-General.\n\nThe place was founded, according to tradition, about the year 1537, by Bas Deo and Barel Deo, from the latter of whom it derives its name. The Katheriyas of Rohilkhand (see Bareilly District) had long been carrying on a desultory warfare with the Musalm\u00e1n governors of Sambhal and Aonla; and the Mughal Imperialists found it necessary to establish a strong outpost to the east of their previous frontier. Troops were thus posted at Bareilly; and round their encampment a city soon sprang up, whose irregular outline and mean architecture still betrays its hasty and temporary origin. The town long remained a mere military station, the last stronghold of the Mughals on their extreme north-eastern frontier. In 1657, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Makrand R\u00e1i, the Hindu governor, founded the new city of Bareilly, cut down the forest to the west of the old town, and expelled all the Katheriyas from its precincts. From 1660 to 1707, the regular succession of Imperial governors at Bareilly continued without a break; but in the last-named year, on the death of the Emperor Aurangzeb, the Hindus threw off the Musalm\u00e1n yoke, and began a series of internecine quarrels with their own co-religionists.\n\nTheir dissensions gave an opportunity for the rise of Ali Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, chief of the Rohill\u00e1 Path\u00e1ns, whose history has been fully related in the article on Bareilly District. For half a century Bareilly remained the capital of the Rohill\u00e1 race, until the conquest of the country by the British forces on behalf of the Naw\u00e1b Wazir of Oudh. From the Waz\u00edrs it passed to the British in 1801, and became at once the head-quarters of a Division and District. Religious disturbances between the Muhammadan and Hindu population arose in 1816, 1837, and 1842, but our rule was never seriously threatened until the Mutiny of 1857. During that great struggle, Bareilly was the centre of disaffection for the whole of Rohilkhand. The troops rebelled on the 31st of May, and Kh\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n, a descendant of the Rohill\u00e1 chieftains, was proclaimed governor. Most of the Europeans escaped to Naini T\u00e1l. After the fall of Lucknow, the Naw\u00e1b of Fatehgarh, the N\u00e1n\u00e1 Sahib, Firoz Sh\u00e1h, and other leading rebels, took refuge in Bareilly. On the 5th of May 1858, the English army arrived before the town, and two days later the rebels fled into Oudh, and the English occupied Bareilly. In 1871, the peace of the town was again disturbed by riots, on the occasion of the\nsynchronous occurrence of the Hindu festival of the R\u00e1mm\u00e1mi with the Muhammadan Muharram. Precautions were taken to prevent an outbreak, but the fanatical Muhammadan populace attacked the Hindu religious procession, and set to work plundering the city. The riot was not quelled until several persons were killed and 158 reported wounded.\n\nThe city has little architectural pretension, the chief buildings being of modern date. The ruins of the ancient fortress, founded by Barel Deo, may still be seen in the old town. A modern fort of considerable strength overlooks the artillery barracks in the cantonments, and supplies a place of refuge and defence for the station. A third and much older fortification owes its origin to R\u00e1j\u00e1 Makrand R\u00e1\u00ed. The chief mosques are the M\u00edrz\u00e1 Masjid, built by M\u00edrz\u00e1 Ain-ul-Mulk about the year 1600, and the Jam\u00e1 Masjid, erected by the Hindu Makrand R\u00e1\u00ed, in 1657. The Naw\u00e1b of R\u00e1mpur has a palace near the city, which he occupies on his visit to Bareilly, and lends at other times to Europeans of high official position. The other buildings include a church, two jails, lunatic asylum, District offices, and railway station. Most of the private houses are built of mud, only 6800 out of 22,800 being of masonry. Some of the new b\u00e1z\u00e1rs, particularly Inglisganj, are clean and well built. Cotton, grain, and sugar form the chief commercial staples; but Bareilly does not rank in the first class of mercantile importance. The manufactures of furniture and upholstery are better and cheaper than elsewhere in Northern India. Bareilly has a Government college, with a Principal and staff of professors, besides high-class schools. Municipal income in 1880\u201381, \u00a39994, of which \u00a39179 was derived from octroi.\n\nB\u00e1rel or Barail.\u2014Hill range in North Cachar, Assam, connecting the Kh\u00e1s\u00ed Hills system with Manipur and the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills. It forms the boundary between North and South Cachar, and lies between 25\u00b0 and 25\u00b0 32' N. lat., and between 93\u00b0 9' and 93\u00b0 46' E. long. The height varies from 2500 to 6000 feet.

The B\u00e1r\u00e1 Pah\u00e1r hills, covered with thick forest, run from west to north for a distance of about 26 miles, with a breadth of about 6 miles. These hills formed a rebel stronghold during the Mutiny of 1857\u201358. The Gond fort of Debrigarh, situated on the highest peak of the range, is a curious old structure, built of massive blocks of granite piled one on the top of the other. The principal river is the Jira, a tributary of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed. The total population of the entire tract in 1881 numbered\n396,138, composed chiefly of Kult\u00e1s, an industrious agricultural class who own most of the soil; Gaurs or herdsmen; Ladras or carriers; and aboriginal Gonds.

The early inhabitants are said to\nhave been Kachheras and Ah\u00edrs, who held the country till the fourteenth century, when they were dispossessed by Prat\u00e1p Singh, a convert to Isl\u00e1m, to whom a farm\u00e1n was granted by the Emperor Tughlak. Prat\u00e1p Singh had three sons prior to his conversion, and one afterwards by his Muhammedan wife. The descendants of the former are still in possession of some of their ancestors' villages; but the great bulk of his estate went to his Musalm\u00e1n son, whose descendants became the hereditary chaudharis of the pargan\u00e1, and the present representative of the family is still recognised by that title. A considerable portion of the pargan\u00e1 is now held by Bais Kshattriyas, who settled here about 250 years ago. The soil is fertile, and facilities exist for irrigation. Area, 125 square miles, of which 76\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) are cultivated. The incidence of the Government land revenue is at the rate of 3s. 9\\(\\frac{5}{8}\\)d. per acre of cultivated area, 2s. 11\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)d. per acre of cultivable area, and 2s. 4\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)d. per acre of total area.

Number of villages, 129.\n\nB\u00e1ri.\u2014Town in Sidhauli tahsil, S\u00edt\u00e1pur District, Oudh; 23 miles south of S\u00edt\u00e1pur town, and 29 miles north of Lucknow. Said to have been founded by Mub\u00e1rak, son of the Emperor Hum\u00e1y\u00fan, who, having come to hunt in the Oudh jungles, built a shooting-box and country house (b\u00e1ri) here, round which a town sprung up. Population (1881) 3102, residing in 565 mud houses. Formerly the head-quarters of the tahsil, which have been removed to Sidhauli. No trade or manufactures.\n\nB\u00e1ri.\u2014Village in Garhw\u00e1l State, North-Western Provinces, on left bank of the Jumna (Jamun\u00e1). Manufacture of woollen cloth. Lat. 30\u00b0 55\u2032 N., long. 78\u00b0 26\u2032 E.\n\nB\u00e1ri.\u2014Town in Dholpur State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na; chief place of a small District of the same name, situated among the hills in the south-west of the territory. Lat. 26\u00b0 38\u2032 N., long. 77\u00b0 42\u2032 E.; distance from Dholpur, 18 miles west\u2014from Agra, 44 miles south-west. Population (1881) 11,547.\n\nB\u00e1ria.\u2014Tributary State in Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha, in the Province of Guzer\u00e1t, Bombay Presidency, lying between 22\u00b0 21\u2032 and 22\u00b0 58\u2032 N. lat., and between 73\u00b0 41\u2032 and 74\u00b0 18\u2032 E. long.; bounded east and west by the British District of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls, north by the States of Sanjeli and Sunth, and south by the State of Chot\u00e1 Udepur. Extreme length north to south, 39 miles. Estimated area, 813 square miles; population (1881) 66,822, or 82\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) per square mile; gross revenue, \u00a318,237. The country is hilly in the south and east, but flat in the west, and is divided into 7 sub-divisions, Randh\u00edkpur, Dudhia, Um\u00e1ria, Haveli, K\u00e1kadkhila, S\u00e1gt\u00e1la, and Rajgad. Much of it is covered with forest. The climate is damp and unhealthy, fever being the prevailing\ndisease. The principal products are cereals, pulses, oil-seeds, and timber. The chiefs of B\u00e1ria are Chauh\u00e1n R\u00e1jputs, who are said to have been driven south by the advance of the Musalm\u00e1ns about the year 1244, and to have taken possession of the city and fort of Ch\u00e1m-p\u00e1ner. Here they ruled till defeated by Muhammad Beg\u00e1ra in 1484, and forced to retire to the wilder parts of their dominions. Of two branches of the family, one founded the house of Chot\u00e1 Udepur, and the other the house of B\u00e1ria. The connection of this State with the British dates from 1803, when, in consequence of the help given by the chief to the British army in their operations against Sindhi\u00e1, the Government subsidized a detachment of B\u00e1ria Bhils, at a monthly cost of \u00a3180. The title of the head of the State is Mah\u00e1r\u00e1wal of Deogarh B\u00e1ria.\n\nThe State pays a tribute of \u00a3933 to the British Government, and maintains a military force of 259 men. There is no sanad authorizing adoption; the succession follows the rule of primogeniture. The ruler is entitled to a salute of 9 guns, and has power to try his own subjects for capital offences, without the express permission of the Political Agent. For the nine years ending 1876, B\u00e1ria was under the direct control of a British officer, during the minority of the present ruler. Of the public works constructed under British management, the chief are the portion (21 miles in length) of the high road between M\u00e1lwa and Guzer\u00e1t, lying within the limits of the B\u00e1ria State, and a branch 7 miles long connecting the town of B\u00e1ria with the main road. A new road from the t\u00e1luk of Lagtatta, chiefly inhabited by Naikra Bhils, has been made to the capital of the State in order to open up communication with these tribes. A dispensary is supported by the State at a yearly cost of \u00a3308, and there are 15 schools with an average attendance of 680 pupils. Transit dues are levied in this State.\n\nB\u00e1ria.\u2014Chief town of the State of B\u00e1ria, in Guzer\u00e1t; in political connection with the Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha Agency of the Bombay Presidency; 50 miles north-east of Baroda. Lat. 22\u00b0 44' N., long. 73\u00b0 56' 30\" E.; population (1881) 3110.\n\nB\u00e1ri Do\u00e1b.\u2014A tract of country in the Punjab, forming the irregular wedge of land between the R\u00e1vi (with the Trim\u00e1b) on the north-west and the Beas (Bi\u00e1s) (with the Sutlej) on the south-east. It lies between 29\u00b0 18' and 32\u00b0 14' N. lat., and between 71\u00b0 4' and 75\u00b0 25' E. long.; comprising the Districts of Gurdaspur and Amritsar, with parts of Lahore, Montgomery and Multan, each of which see separately. Length, 370 miles; average breadth, 45 miles. Traversed by the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway, and watered in its north-eastern portion by the B\u00e1ri Do\u00e1b Canal. The upper tract, irrigated by the canal, is fertile and populous; but towards the south the country becomes barren and\ndesert, except where a narrow fringe of cultivation extends along the sides of the great boundary rivers. Commercially and agriculturally, this region is the most important of all the Do\u00e1bs which make up the Punjab Proper, containing, as it does, the great cities of Lahore, Mult\u00e1n, and Amritsar, together with the watered plains of the north-eastern slope. The name 'B\u00e1ri' Do\u00e1b was formed by Akbar as a combination of Bi\u00e1s and R\u00e1vi.\n\n**B\u00e1ri Do\u00e1b Canal.**\u2014An important irrigation work in Gurd\u00e1spur, Amritsar, and Lahore Districts, Punjab, drawn from the river R\u00e1vi; passing through the upper portion of the tract from which it takes its name, and watering, in 1880\u201381, a total area of 433,080 acres. Lies between $31^\\circ 4'$ and $32^\\circ 22'$ N. lat., and between $74^\\circ$ and $75^\\circ 41'$ E. long. The present undertaking originated in a project for the improvement of an older work, the Hasli Canal, constructed about the year 1633 by Ali Mard\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n, the famous engineer of the Emperor Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n. After the occupation of Lahore, in 1846, Major Napier (now Lord Napier of Magdala) turned his attention at once to this project, and set on foot the necessary surveys. The progress of the work was interrupted by the outbreak of the Mult\u00e1n war, but continued after the annexation. The alignment of the Hasli Canal proved on examination to be so defective, that the officers in charge decided upon the adoption of an entirely independent line for the new canal, parts only of the original channel being utilized as distributaries. The main difficulty of the modern scheme was found in the slope of the country through which its upper portion must unavoidably pass, the fall being as much as 200 feet in the first 13 miles. It was at that time considered impossible to take the supply from any points lower down the river, as it was supposed that the fierce floods of the R\u00e1vi would not permit the construction of a permanent dam across its main channel. It was therefore thought necessary to seek a branch which would yield a sufficient quantity of water in the rains, and into which the whole body might be diverted during the dry season. The only branch which answered these requirements was that already utilized for the Hasli Canal.\n\nThe head-works were accordingly constructed opposite the village of M\u00e1dhupur, about 7 miles north-west of Path\u00e1nkot, and a short distance above those belonging to Ali Mard\u00e1n's undertaking. The minimum cold weather supply in 1847\u201348 having been found by Lieutenant Dyas (the engineer in charge of the works) to be 2753 cubic feet per second, and as this was believed to be unusually low, he fixed the discharge of the canal at 3000 cubic feet per second. As a matter of fact, however, the actual minimum in the cold weather has occasionally run down to less than 1600 cubic feet per second; whilst, on the other hand, as much as 4000 cubic feet per second has been at\ntimes admitted into the canal during the hot weather. The channel strikes off across the plain at once, and runs almost due south till it reaches a point parallel with D\u00edn\u00e1nagar, where it becomes available for purposes of irrigation. The B\u00e1ri Do\u00e1b is marked off into several minor divisions by natural lines of drainage, and great branches of the canal, 4 in number, run along the crest of each principal dividing ridge between their basins. The Kas\u00far branch diverges from the main line in the thirty-first mile of its course, and flows on nearly due south; while the main line turns south-westward, and follows the watershed of the Kas\u00far n\u00e1l\u00e1. Seven miles farther, the Kas\u00far branch sub-divides; one of its channels, still retaining the same name, following the line of upland between the Patti and Kas\u00far n\u00e1l\u00e1\u00eds, while the other, known as the Sobr\u00e1on branch, continues southwards between the Patti n\u00e1l\u00e1 and the Beas (Bi\u00e1s). Both these distributaries eventually end in the old bed of the last-named river.\n\nThe main line runs on undivided till it reaches its fifty-fourth mile; but, a little north-west of Majitha, it gives off the Lahore branch. This channel crosses the head of the Udi\u00e1ra n\u00e1l\u00e1, follows the line of highest ground between the Udi\u00e1ra and the R\u00e1vi, passing between Lahore and Mi\u00e1n M\u00edr (Meean Meer), and ends in the R\u00e1vi a few miles below Lahore. The main branch runs on, still south-westward, down the very centre of the Do\u00e1b uplands, which narrow just below Lahore into a mere strip of country between the R\u00e1vi and the ancient bed of the Beas. At last, near Changa Manga, at the southern extremity of Lahore District, the main stream debouches into the R\u00e1vi.\n\nThe B\u00e1ri Do\u00e1b Canal was commenced in 1849-50, and completed and ready for work by the end of the year 1859-60, and irrigation operations commenced in the following season. The head-works, however, were then of a temporary nature, the permanent weir and other regulating machinery not being fully completed till 1873. The aggregate length of the main and branch canals amounted in 1882 to 388 miles, with 862 miles of minor distributaries (r\u00e1jbah\u00e1s). The total capital expenditure (exclusive of interest) up to the end of 1880-81 reached the sum of \u00a31,496,746. The gross income in that year was returned at \u00a3107,492, or, including increase of land revenue due to irrigation, \u00a3135,135; the working expenses of the year were \u00a342,272. The net profit in 1880-81 amounted to \u00a365,220, or 4'3 per cent. on the capital outlay; while the gross profit, inclusive of increased land revenue, was \u00a392,863, or 6'2 per cent. on the capital outlay. The regular income is derived from water rates, which rule as follows per acre:\u2014For overflow, sugar-cane, 12s.; rice and gardens, 9s. 6d.; sundry crops, from 3s. to 5s.; single watering on fallow, 1s. 6d.; for lift one-half the above rates. The total area irrigated by the canal has risen from 89,756 acres in 1860-61, to 433,080 acres in 1880-81. The\ncanal waters portions of Gurdaspur, Amritsar, and Lahore Districts, and has been largely instrumental in the substitution of cotton, sugar-cane, and superior cereals for the common food-stuffs which were formerly almost the only crops grown on this thirsty tract. It has also induced a steady improvement in methods of agriculture, the uncertainty of the water supply in previous years having been the main drawback to the industrious peasantry; while the danger of famine in the three irrigated Districts may now be considered as far less imminent than formerly.\n\nB\u00e1rigura.\u2014Town of Rewah Native State in Baghelkhand, Central India. Population (1881) 6625.\n\nBar\u00eds\u00e1l.\u2014The head-quarters Sub-division of B\u00e1karganj District, Bengal, lying between $22^\\circ 28'$ and $22^\\circ 40'$ N. lat., and between $90^\\circ 13'$ $45''$ and $90^\\circ 37' 45''$ E. long.; area, 1111 square miles; number of villages and towns, 1982; number of occupied houses, 100,034; population (1881) 814,595, namely, 499,487 Muhammadans (or 61.32 per cent. of the population), 311,485 Hindus, 3491 Christians, 59 Buddhists, and 73 'others;' number of males, 410,475, females, 404,120; average density of population, 733 per square mile; houses per square mile, 94; persons per occupied house, 8. The Sub-division was established in 1801; it comprises the 6 th\u00e1n\u00e1s (police circles) of Bar\u00eds\u00e1l, Jh\u00e1lak\u00e1t\u00ed, Nalch\u00edt\u00ed, B\u00e1karhanj, Mehnd\u00edganj, and Gaurn\u00e1di. In 1882, there were 7 magisterial and revenue courts, and the total police force, including village watchmen, numbered 2292.\n\nBar\u00eds\u00e1l.\u2014Town and civil station of B\u00e1karganj District, Bengal, on the west bank of the Bar\u00eds\u00e1l river. Lat. $22^\\circ 41' 40''$ N., long. $90^\\circ 24' 30''$ E. Population (1881) 13,186, namely, 6828 Muhammadans, 6041 Hindus, and 317 'others.' Area of town site, 3756 acres. Municipal income in 1880-81, \u00a31206; expenditure, \u00a31217. The head-quarters of the District, formerly at B\u00e1karganj, were transferred to Bar\u00eds\u00e1l in 1801.\n\nB\u00e1riya.\u2014State in Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See Bar\u00eda.\n\nBarkal Hills.\u2014Range in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bengal; principal peak, Barkal Tang (lat. $22^\\circ 45'$ N., long. $92^\\circ 22'$ E.), 1879 feet in height. The hills are covered with dense jungle; the ascents are very steep, and can only be made along known zig-zag paths. Wild elephants, however, reach the summits; and if proper paths were cut through the jungle, laden animals could doubtless do the same.\n\nBarkal Rapids.\u2014A succession of low falls and long rocky slopes, about a mile in length, forming part of the course of the Karnaphuli river, in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bengal. Lat. $23^\\circ 43'$ N., long. $92^\\circ 26'$ E. The falls are 20 miles above K\u00e1s\u00e1lang, a place distant about 100 miles from the mouth of the Karnaphuli. They greatly impede navigation, as traders have to disembark their goods, drag their\nboats with great labour over the rapids, and re-load above the falls. This is an expensive operation, and affects the prices of all imported articles above the falls to the extent of nearly a hundred per cent.\n\n**Barkal\u00far** *(Bracalor of Faria-y-Souza; Colloor of the Trigonometrical Survey Map; Barsalor of Horsburgh).*\u2014A ruined town in South K\u00e1nara District, Madras Presidency. Lat. $13^\\circ 50'$ N., long. $74^\\circ 53'$ E. \u2018Once,\u2019 according to Faria-y-Souza *(Annals, 1581\u20131584)*, \u2018one of the most noted places of trade in India, in the form of a commonwealth, but much decayed since the Portuguese built a fort there.\u2019 Distant (direct) from Mangalore, 68 miles north; from Bombay, 380 miles south-east; from Bangalore, 195 miles north-west; from Madras, 370 miles west.\u2014See BAIRUR.\n\n**Barkhera** *(Bar\u00e1, or Mota).*\u2014Petty Estate or guaranteed Th\u00e1kurate in the Bh\u00edl (Bheel) Agency of Central India. The chief, or Bh\u00famia, has relations both with Dh\u00e1r and with Sindhia. He holds from Dh\u00e1r 3 villages in Dharmpuri, subject to a payment of \u00a386, 12s.; from Sindhia he holds certain villages in the Sagor *pargan\u00e1*, on which he pays \u00a3165; and also 5 villages in Dekth\u00e1n, on which he pays \u00a3140.\n\n**Barkhera** *(Chhot\u00e1, or Sorpur).*\u2014Petty Estate or guaranteed Th\u00e1kurate in the Bh\u00edl (Bheel) Agency of Central India. The chief, or Bh\u00famia, pays to the Dh\u00e1r State \u00a315 on 4 villages; and is responsible for police duties in 15 villages jointly with the Bh\u00famia of Bar\u00e1 Barkhera.\n\n**Barkop.**\u2014Village and group of hills 9 miles north of Godda, Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s, Bengal. They are four in number, nearly in line with one another; the two central peaks being conical, while the outside ones slope down to the plain in long irregular ridges. The village is at the foot of the hills, and is the seat of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Barkop.\n\n**Bark\u00far.**\u2014Former Sub-division of K\u00e1nara, Madras Presidency, comprising a portion of the western declivity of the Gh\u00e1ts; very hilly, and traversed by numerous mountain streams. This tract, at a remote period of history, formed part of the Kadamba realm, overthrown, as tradition relates, in the 2nd century A.D. It subsequently became subject to Vijayanagar, but after the defeat of that power at T\u00e1l\u00edkot (1565), passed into the hands of the Bedn\u00far R\u00e1j\u00e1. In 1763, Haidar Ali absorbed Bedn\u00far, and after the death of his son, Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n, the country was incorporated in the British dominions.\n\n**Bark\u00far** *(Hangarkatta).*\u2014Village and port in South K\u00e1nara District, Madras Presidency. Lat. $13^\\circ 28' 30''$ N., long. $74^\\circ 47' 50''$ E. Exports (1880\u201381), \u00a347,870; imports, \u00a317,896. The present town marks the site of a very ancient city, once the largest in K\u00e1nara, and even in the 16th century of considerable importance. As the stronghold of the Vijayanagar R\u00e1j\u00e1s, who obtained possession of it in 1335, the ruined city possesses much interest for the antiquary. Traces of the great fort built by Hari Har R\u00e1j\u00e1, about 1370, still exist, as also the tanks\nand part of the walls of an old palace. Ruins of Buddhist temples abound, and inscriptions testify that in the 14th century Baikur was the seat of the viceregal government of the Rai of Vijayanagar. Among the sculptures, one representing a procession of armed men, bearing a striking resemblance in equipments and general appearance to the Greek soldiery, and another of a centaur, deserve special mark. Tradition asserts that it was from here that the Alya Santana law of inheritance was promulgated. The present town possesses some trade in brass and copper utensils.\u2014See Hangarkatta.\n\nB\u00e1rmu\u00e1r\u00e1.\u2014Tributary State in M\u00e1hi K\u00e1ntha, Guzer\u00e1t Province, Bombay Presidency. Population (1881) 4065. Revenue, \u00a3150; expenditure, \u00a3180. Tribute, \u00a390, payable to Baroda.\n\nB\u00e1rm\u00fal Pass.\u2014Mountain gorge in Daspall\u00e1 State, Orissa, near Go\u00e1ldeo Peak. Lat. 20\u00b0 30' N., long. 84\u00b0 50' E. The pass is overhung with crags and peaks of wild beauty, and the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed river sweeps through it, forming the northern boundary of the State. The hills on either side are magnificently wooded, and the gorge is at one part so narrow that the river rises 70 feet in time of flood. During the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 war of 1803, the Barm\u00fal Pass was forced by a British force under Major Forbes. It was here that the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s made their last stand; but on the 2nd of November 1803 they were completely defeated, and with difficulty escaped over the hills.\n\nBarnad\u00ed.\u2014River in Assam, flowing south from the mountains of Bh\u00fat\u00e1n into the Brahmaputra, in Nowgong District. Lat. at point of junction 26\u00b0 13' N., long. 91\u00b0 48' E. For the most part it forms the boundary between K\u00e1mrup District on the west and Darrang District on the east; but its channel is liable to constant changes, which have left many old beds. It is navigable by large country boats in the rainy season, and by canoes during the rest of the year.\n\nB\u00e1rnagar.\u2014Town in Gwalior territory, Central India. Population (1881) 7908.\n\nBaroda (Wadodr\u00e1).\u2014Non-tributary State, in direct political relation with the Government of India; including all the territories of his Highness the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r, in different parts of the Province of Guzer\u00e1t, Bombay Presidency. These territories (lying between 21\u00b0 51' and 22\u00b0 49' N. lat., and between 72\u00b0 53' and 73\u00b0 55' E. long.) have, according to the Census of 1881, a total area of 8570 square miles, and a population of 2,185,005, or 255 to the square mile. They are divided into four administrative Divisions, viz. (1) the K\u00e1di or northern Division, comprising the Districts of Pattan, K\u00e1di, V\u00edjapur, V\u00edsnagar, Dehg\u00e1on, Kalol, Vadaoli, Sidhpur, Kher\u00e1lu, and Mes\u00e1na; (2) the central or Baroda Division, comprising the Districts round Baroda itself, viz. Baroda, Choranda, Jarod, Petlad, Padra, Dabhoi, Sinoe, and Sankheda; (3) the southern, or the Navs\u00e1ri Division, comprising the Districts of Navs\u00e1ri,\nGandevi, Pals\u00e1na, K\u00e1mrij, Vel\u00e1chha, Moha, Vyaro, and Tongarh; (4) the Amreli Division, comprising the Districts of Amreli, Okh\u00e1mandal, Korin\u00e1r, Dh\u00e1ri, and D\u00e1mnagar. With the exception of the Amreli Division, which is in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, the others are much intermixed with British territory, and also with the lands belonging to minor chiefs, tributary to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r, but under the political supervision of the British Government.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The northern Districts in Guzer\u00e1t form a wide plain, drained by the rivers Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda), T\u00e1pti, Mahi, and several smaller streams. The surface consists chiefly of reg\u00e1r, or black cotton soil, and a light-coloured soil locally known as gor\u00e1ru. The natural fertility of the black cotton soil is well known. The gor\u00e1ru soil is also fertile when manured and irrigated; in dry weather, where subject to much traffic, as in roads, it forms deep, heavy, and almost impalpable sand, which again after rain becomes tolerably compact. The roads are generally lined by hedges of cactus, irregularly planted. Deserted towns, ruined temples, and tanks now partly filled with mud, bear testimony to the former prosperity of the country. Okh\u00e1mandal, in the extreme north-west of the peninsula of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, surrounded on three sides by the sea or the Gulf of Cutch, partakes of the general appearance of the Province of Cutch (Kachchh), being everywhere sandy and covered with loose stones. The Amreli Mahals resemble the rest of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. The country is open, the soil good, and well watered with perennial streams. The central Division, surrounding the city of Baroda, is perfectly flat and covered with trees, the soil fertile and highly cultivated, yielding crops of the most highly prized cotton. The fourth or southern Division, including the lands that intermix with the British District of Surat, is also fertile and well cultivated, especially in the neighbourhood of the town of Navs\u00e1ri.\n\nThe principal rivers flowing through the territory are the Saraswat\u00ed, S\u00e1barmat\u00ed, Mahi, Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda), Purna, Dhutarw\u00e1d, Shetrunj\u00ed, Mesw\u00e1, W\u00e1trak, Shetruti, Dh\u00e1dh\u00e1r, Kim, and Ambika. The lesser streams are the Ban\u00e1s, Rupan, Lun, J\u00e1ri, Vishw\u00e1mitri, Sury\u00e1, Or, Varn\u00e1, Amb\u00e1, Karad, Jambua, and Tembh\u00ed. Water is obtained chiefly from wells, but in almost all parts of the territory there are fine reservoirs. The rivers have worn their courses deep below the level of the rich alluvial deposit, and, except on occasions of flood, no longer serve to fertilize the soil.\n\nApart from the R\u00e1jpipla Hills, which fringe the southern limit of the central Division, there is no range of mountains in the whole territory.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1881 gives a total population of 2,185,005 persons (1,139,512 males, and 1,045,493 females), or 255 to the square mile. Of these, 1,954,390, or 89.45 per cent., are returned as Hindus;\n174,980, or 8 per cent., as Musalm\u00e1ns; 46,718 as Jains; 771 Christians; 8118 P\u00e1rs\u00eds; and 28 'others.' The percentage of males to the total population is 52\u00b715. Of the 1,954,390 Hindus, 138,506 are Br\u00e1hmans, and 79,853 R\u00e1jputs. Baniy\u00e1s or traders number 57,027. The agricultural or pastoral castes number 482,928, the most numerous being the Kanb\u00eds (391,984); fishing and boating castes number 14,835; artisans, 160,217; domestic servants, 32,671; labouring and wandering castes, 69,192; mendicant castes, 20,551; and 'depressed' castes, 191,461, including 110,040 Dhers. Of the 174,980 Musalm\u00e1ns, 155,653 are Sunnis and 19,327 Shi\u00e1s. The agricultural population of the State, as in other parts of Guzer\u00e1t, is mainly composed of Br\u00e1hmans of the Bh\u00e1thel\u00e1 clan, Kanb\u00eds, R\u00e1jputs, and Kol\u00eds. There are also Borah cultivators in the north and south, and Bhils in the wilder tracts towards the south. In the highly-cultivated parts, the Kanb\u00eds predominate. The mercantile community is said to be in a prosperous condition, and many families, especially those who in former times acted as State bankers, are possessed of great wealth. In recent years a large number of Br\u00e1hmans, Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and other natives of the Deccan and Konkan have permanently settled in Baroda territory. In the northern and eastern Districts the chief cultivators are Kol\u00eds and R\u00e1jputs in poor circumstances. With these are interspersed Bh\u00e1ts, Ch\u00e1rans, and religious mendicants of different descriptions, some of whom, such as the Gos\u00e1ins, who inhabit monasteries called maths, are often the wealthiest and most influential land-owners in the country.\n\nExcluding Bombay and Surat, the number of P\u00e1rs\u00eds is nowhere greater than in the Baroda territory. With the exception of about 175 residing in Baroda city and at other places, the P\u00e1rsi population is collected at Navs\u00e1ri, about 15 miles from Surat, where they are said to have first settled with their sacred fire about 450 years ago. The two hill forts of Songarh and S\u00e1ler are worthy of notice. Songarh, 43 miles east of Surat and a few miles south of the T\u00e1pti, commands a path much favoured by the bands which from time to time invaded the plain of Guzer\u00e1t from the higher lands of Kh\u00e1ndesh, and was for many years the head-quarters of the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r's power. S\u00e1ler is at the south-east corner of the Baroda territory. These two, which both lie in Navs\u00e1ri District, and also the fort of Mulher, are still garrisoned with militia. R\u00fapgarh, a hill fort 10 miles south of Songarh, is not garrisoned, but W\u00e1jpur on the T\u00e1pti river, once a strong place, has a garrison. Among other places of interest in the State may be mentioned\u2014Vohor\u00e1 Kathor, famous for the manufacture of the deep-red dye extracted from the roots of the moringa tree; Sojitr\u00e1, celebrated for its knives; Dabhoi, where turbans and s\u00e1ris are woven in large quantities; Pattan, well known for its knives, nut-crackers, and specially for its pottery, which is\nremarkable for lightness and strength, as well as for the taste with which it is coloured.\n\n**History.**\u2014The name by which the rulers of the Baroda State are generally known is that of G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r; the family title is Sena Kh\u00e1s Khel Shamsher Bah\u00e1dur, and the title of Farzand-i-Kh\u00e1s, Daulat-i-Englishia, was conferred on the chief at the Delhi Darbar on 1st January 1877. The G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda is entitled to a salute of 21 guns. The family first rose out of obscurity in 1720\u201321, when, at the battle of B\u00e1lpur, Dam\u00e1j\u00ed G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r so distinguished himself that Kh\u00e1ndi R\u00e1o Dhabar\u00e1i, who held the rank of Senap\u00e1t\u00ed or commander-in-chief of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 army, strongly recommended him to R\u00e1j\u00e1 Shah\u00fa of Sat\u00e1ra, and procured his appointment as second in command, with the title of Shamsher Bah\u00e1dur. Dam\u00e1j\u00ed dying soon after, was succeeded in this office by his nephew Pil\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r, who continued to be the lieutenant of Trimbak R\u00e1o Dhabar\u00e1i, the son and successor of the Senap\u00e1t\u00ed; and the two forthwith commenced their career of marauding in the fertile plains of Guzer\u00e1t. But in 1729 the Peshw\u00e1 B\u00e1i R\u00e1o obtained from Sarbuland Kh\u00e1n, the Mughal governor of Guzer\u00e1t, a cession of *chauth* and other dues of that Province, and among other conditions of the grant, engaged to prevent Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 subjects from taking part with disaffected *zam\u00edn-d\u00e1rs*, or other disturbers of the peace. This clause was specially aimed at Pil\u00e1j\u00ed G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r, who, as deputy of the Senap\u00e1t\u00ed, and himself in possession of the stronghold of Songhar (1719), commanding the principal route from the Deccan into Guzer\u00e1t, exercised a commanding influence over the Bh\u00edls and Kol\u00eds of the country, and had for some years levied contributions in his annual incursions.\n\nAccordingly, Trimbak R\u00e1o Dhabar\u00e1i and Pil\u00e1j\u00ed banded together the disaffected Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 chiefs to oppose the Peshw\u00e1, but in a battle fought near Baroda, on the 1st of April 1731, the confederates were defeated and Trimbak R\u00e1o Dhabar\u00e1i was killed. His infant son, Jaswant R\u00e1o, was, however, appointed to the office of Senap\u00e1t\u00ed, while Pil\u00e1j\u00ed G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r was confirmed in his former rank of lieutenant or Mut\u00e1l\u00edk, with the additional title of Sena Kh\u00e1s Khel. It was further agreed that Jaswant R\u00e1o should have the entire management in Guzer\u00e1t, paying half the contributions to the Peshw\u00e1, and accounting for all sums levied from countries not mentioned in the deed of cession given by Sarbuland Kh\u00e1n to the Peshw\u00e1. This deed, however, had been in the meantime disallowed by the Emperor of Delhi. Sarbuland Kh\u00e1n was removed from office, and superseded by Abh\u00ed Singh, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Jodhpur (Jodhpore). On this Pil\u00e1j\u00ed declared open war against the Imperial officers, defeated them in the field, and occupied many of the principal towns. Abh\u00ed Singh, finding that the personal qualities of Pil\u00e1j\u00ed made him specially formidable, procured his assassination under the pretext of a conference, in 1732.\nPil\u00e1j\u00ed was succeeded by his son Dam\u00e1j\u00ed, during whose long and active career of nearly forty years, the whole of Guzer\u00e1t was wrested from the Mughals. Jaswant R\u00e1o, the Senapati, when he came of age, proved incompetent for his post, and the Dhabar\u00e1i family now gave place to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1rs. Possession of Baroda was obtained by Mah\u00e1ji G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r, brother of Pil\u00e1j\u00ed, in 1732, and the city has ever since been held by the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1rs as the capital of their dominions. Dam\u00e1j\u00ed G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r supported T\u00e1r\u00e1 B\u00e1\u00ed in her effort to free her grandson, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sat\u00e1ra, from the thraldom of the Peshw\u00e1 B\u00e1l\u00e1j\u00ed B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o; but he was treacherously seized by the Peshw\u00e1, and was not released till he consented to pay 15 lakhs of rupees on account of arrears of tribute in Guzer\u00e1t, and also executed a bond to share equally all his possessions and future conquests. In the following year, the Peshw\u00e1 obtained a partition of Dam\u00e1j\u00ed G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r's conquests in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, and the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r agreed to assist the Peshw\u00e1 with troops when necessary. Forthwith the armies of Dom\u00e1j\u00ed G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r and of the Peshw\u00e1, under Raghuba, proceeded to the joint conquest of Guzer\u00e1t. By 1755, the Mughal Government in Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d was entirely subverted. The revenue of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d was divided between Dam\u00e1j\u00ed and the Peshw\u00e1; but, with the exception of one gateway, the city was held by the troops of the latter.\n\nIn the historic battle of P\u00e1nipat, fought on the 7th of January 1761, Dam\u00e1j\u00ed commanded his own contingent, and acquitted himself with credit. His horsemen supported the advance of the infantry of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 army, under the command of Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Kh\u00e1n Gard\u00ed, which defeated the opposite wing of the Afgh\u00e1ns; and Dam\u00e1j\u00ed was one of the few chiefs of the highest rank who returned in safety to their homes from that fatal field. The remaining years of his life were spent in enlarging and consolidating his territories. He dispossessed the family of Jaw\u00e1n Mard Kh\u00e1n B\u00e1bi of nearly all the Districts it had retained in northern Guzer\u00e1t, leaving it only the original j\u00e1g\u00edr of R\u00e1dhanpur and S\u00e1mi. He reduced the R\u00e1htor princes of Edar to the status of tributaries, made repeated progresses into K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, where he made some solid acquisitions besides exacting black-mail, and, in fine, established himself as a sovereign power of the first class. His connection with Raghuba, the Peshw\u00e1's general, was unfortunate. He supported him in his rebellion against M\u00e1dhu R\u00e1o, and furnished him with troops under his own son, Govind R\u00e1o. But in this war he was defeated, and Govind R\u00e1o himself was taken prisoner at Dhodap, and he was compelled to submit to the imposition of a tribute of Rs. 525,000, and to render annual service with 3000 horse during peace and 4000 during war. He also agreed to pay Rs. 254,000 for certain Districts which the Peshw\u00e1 promised to restore to him, making his tribute in all Rs. 779,000.\nThe death of Dam\u00e1j\u00ed, in 1768, was the signal for family dissensions, which eventually brought the State into its present connection with the British Government. Dam\u00e1j\u00ed had three lawful wives, and male issue by each. His first wife had one son, Govind R\u00e1o; but the eldest son, Sy\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o, as well as Fateh Singh, were born of his second wife. Govind R\u00e1o was at Poona (P\u00fana) at the time of his father's death, and on paying a large nazar to the Peshw\u00e1 M\u00e1dhu R\u00e1o, and agreeing to the arrangements concluded with Dam\u00e1j\u00ed three years before, he procured his recognition as successor to his father's office of Sena Kh\u00e1s Khel. But Fateh Singh, a man of energy and talent, placed his brother Sy\u00e1j\u00ed on the throne at Baroda, and himself assumed the regency. He then proceeded in person to Poona, to obtain the reversal of the Peshw\u00e1's decision in favour of Govind R\u00e1o. M\u00e1dhu R\u00e1o, whose object was to divide the family, and thereby reduce the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r's power, eventually admitted Sy\u00e1j\u00ed's right, and thus the half-brothers Govind R\u00e1o and Fateh Singh were made implacable enemies. To strengthen his position, Fateh Singh made overtures for an alliance with the British Government in 1772, but his proposal was at that time rejected. Colonel Keating's and Raghub\u00e1's campaign in Gujar\u00e1t was followed by a rupture between the Court of Poona and the British Government, and this occasioned an offensive and defensive treaty with Fateh Singh, concluded by General Goddard on the 20th January 1780. This treaty was virtually annulled on the conclusion of peace with the Poona Government in 1782.\n\nFateh Singh G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r died on the 21st December 1789. M\u00e1n\u00e1j\u00ed, the younger son by a third wife of Dam\u00e1j\u00ed, assumed charge of the Government for his brother Sy\u00e1j\u00ed, and was recognised by the Peshw\u00e1 on payment of a large nazar. At his death, in 1793, he was succeeded by Govind R\u00e1o, to whom the Peshw\u00e1 leased his share of the revenues of the Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d Districts. In September 1800, Govind R\u00e1o died, and his eldest son, Anand R\u00e1o, was acknowledged as his successor. He was of weak intellect, and the powers of the State were usurped by his illegitimate half-brother, Kanoj\u00ed R\u00e1o. The Minister of Anand R\u00e1o made overtures to the British Government, to subsidize five battalions of Sepoys if Kanoj\u00ed were reduced, and Anand R\u00e1o saved from the domination of his Arab soldiery, whose demands for payment of arrears had become most menacing, while their fidelity was more than doubtful. The requisite assistance was given, Kanoj\u00ed was removed to Madras, the Arabs crushed, and the money advanced or borrowed on British guarantee for payment of the troops, whose numbers were reduced. In 1815, in consequence of the murder of an envoy from Baroda, the well-known Gang\u00e1dhar Sh\u00e1stri, the connection was broken off between the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r and the Peshw\u00e1, the head of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 confederacy. The latter had to renounce all future rights against the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r, and to\naccept of an annual tribute of 4 l\u00eekhs of rupees (\u00a340,000) in lieu of all claims, but the Gaekw\u00e2r was released from the payment of even this small tribute on the overthrow of the Peshw\u00e2.\n\nIn 1817, a treaty was concluded for an increase of the subsidiary force, the cession to the British Government (for the payment of the additional force) of all the rights the Gaekw\u00e2r had acquired by the so-called Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e2d farm on the Peshw\u00e2r's territories in Guzer\u00e2t, the consolidation of the territories of the British Government and of the Gaekw\u00e2r by exchange of certain Districts, the co-operation of the Gaekw\u00e2r's troops with those of the British Government in time of war, an engagement by the Gaekw\u00e2r to maintain a contingent of 3000 horse at the disposal of the British Government, and the mutual surrender of criminals. Anand R\u00e1o Gaekw\u00e2r died in 1819, and was succeeded by his younger brother, Sy\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o, who in 1820 entered into a further convention with the British, whereby he agreed to send no troops into K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r and Mahi K\u00e1ntha, and to make no demands on his tributaries except through the medium of the British Government, who on their part engaged to procure payment of the tribute free of expense to the Gaekw\u00e2r. In 1847, Sy\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o died, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Ganpat R\u00e1o, who, dying without male issue in 1856, was succeeded by his brother, Khandi R\u00e1o. During the Mutiny of 1857-58, Khandi R\u00e1o Gaekw\u00e2r rendered faithful service to the British Government; and as a reward for his loyalty, the payment of 3 lakhs of rupees per annum was remitted, for which the Gaekw\u00e2r's Government was liable for the maintenance of a body of cavalry known as the Guzer\u00e2t Irregular Horse. He was also created G.C.S.I. in 1862.\n\nKhandi R\u00e1o died on the 28th November 1870, leaving no son, though his younger wife, Jamn\u00e1b\u00e1\u00ed, was at the time of his death enceinte. The next heir to the throne was Khandi R\u00e1o's younger brother, Malh\u00e1r R\u00e1o, who had been accused, in 1863, of being concerned in a conspiracy to compass the death of his brother, Khandi R\u00e1o, by poison or other means, and was in consequence confined as a State prisoner at Padra, in Baroda territory. On the death of Khandi R\u00e1o, Malh\u00e1r R\u00e1o was installed as his successor, on the understanding that if Jamn\u00e1b\u00e1\u00ed were delivered of a son, the child should be recognised as Gaekw\u00e2r. The posthumous child being a girl, Malh\u00e1r R\u00e1o retained his position. Malh\u00e1r R\u00e1o's rule, however, was such, that within three years after his installation, the British Government was obliged to appoint a Commission to inquire into numerous charges of maladministration preferred against him through the Resident at Baroda. On consideration of the report submitted by the Commission, the Government of India decided on giving the Gaekw\u00e2r a term of seventeen months for effecting certain reforms described in the report as specially called for.\nBefore the expiration of this period, however, an attempt was made, in November 1874, to poison the Resident, Colonel Phayre. The inquiries instituted having warranted the conclusion that the attempt was instigated by Malh\u00e1r R\u00e1o, he was suspended from the functions of ruler on the 14th January 1875; and the charges against him were investigated by a High Commission, consisting of three European and three native members. The Commission was equally divided in opinion as to the guilt of Malh\u00e1r R\u00e1o; and the Government of India having regard to Malh\u00e1r R\u00e1o's notorious misconduct, his gross misgovernment of the State, and his evident incapacity to carry into effect the necessary reforms, deposed him from the sovereignty of the Baroda State, on 22nd April 1875. Sy\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o, a descendant of Prat\u00e1p R\u00e1o, son of Pil\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o, the founder of the family, and younger brother of Dam\u00e1j\u00ed, whose line terminated with Malh\u00e1r R\u00e1o, having been selected as the most fit successor, Jamn\u00e1b\u00e1i, the widow of Khandi R\u00e1o G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r, was permitted to adopt him, in consideration of Khandi R\u00e1o's services during the Mutiny; and on the 27th May 1875, Sy\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o was installed as G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r.\n\nThe Military Force maintained by the Baroda State consists of a regular force of 2 batteries of artillery, with 154 artillerymen and 42 guns (including 2 of gold and 2 of silver); a cavalry force of 247 officers and men, and 6 regiments of infantry,\u2014aggregating 3016 of all ranks. These troops are all drilled and equipped on a similar system to that of the British army. Of the artillery, 1 battery consists of 2 gold and 2 silver 3-pounder guns respectively, and 1 light field battery of 6 guns, each being drawn by bullocks. Of the 6 regiments of infantry, 2 are local regiments, employed in the K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r Districts. Besides the regular army there is also a large irregular force, numbering about 6237, viz. 4410 horse and 1827 foot. The cost of the regular force is about 7\u00bd l\u00e1khs of rupees (\u00a375,000), while that of the irregular is estimated at 28 l\u00e1khs (\u00a3280,000) a year.\n\nAgriculture, etc.\u2014Luxuriant crops are grown of grain, cotton, tobacco, opium, sugar-cane, and oil-seeds. The staple food of the people is b\u00e1jr\u00e1, but wheat and rice are also largely consumed. The Northern Division of Baroda is famous for its breed of large white cattle. Those used for travelling-carts are of great size and strength, and able to travel considerable distances; for short journeys they can keep up a pace of about 6 miles an hour. The breed of horses raised in the K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r Districts is celebrated throughout India.\n\nLand Tenures.\u2014With regard to lands which pay revenue, it may be broadly laid down that they are at the absolute disposal of the Government, the cultivators holding them at its pleasure, and not being in any degree proprietors, except when they have acquired rights either by direct grant or immemorial custom. Still,\nthe cultivator is not usually interfered with as long as he pays his revenue.\n\nThe prevailing tenure is riyatwari, where the State collects the revenue without the intervention of a third party. The varieties of this tenure are three:\u20141st, When the collection is made in cash assessed on each prevalent measure of land, such as the bigha; 2nd, When it is made in kind, according to a fixed share of the produce; 3rd, When it is made in cash at a certain rate per plough. There are other varieties of assessment adopted over an insignificant area of land among primitive communities, such as assessment by pickaxe. The old system of farming out villages and entire districts has been abolished, except in some exceptional cases. A permanent assessment has been granted to a few villages.\n\nIn cases where the State levies its assessments in kind, its share is fixed beforehand for every class of crop, the monsoon crops yielding a much larger share than the cold-season crops, which, again, pay more than those of the hot season, depending as these last do on irrigation. Besides the share in kind, a small rate in cash is charged on the estimated area of each holding, which is often miscalculated, but always in favour of the cultivator. The State also levies small quantities of the produce as contributions towards the expenses of the village, etc. The produce is either estimated as it stands in the field, or is actually weighed in the village barnyard, and the State share is then collected into storehouses and sold by officials.\n\nThe plough assessment, prevalent in the eastern Districts of the Navsari (southern) Division, and also in one Sub-division in the central Division inhabited by Bhils and other primitive communities, is as follows:\u2014A rate is fixed for one plough worked by two oxen, and increased if more than two pairs are employed, so that 3 oxen equal 1\u00bd plough; there is no limit to the amount of land the plough may be passed over.\n\nBesides the above, the other prevailing custom, the narwa, is a lump sum assessed on the village from time to time according to its capabilities. The settlement is made with the narwadars or superior holders, who in most cases are the descendants of men who established or peopled the village. The founders originally divided the lands and the village site among themselves according to the exigency of the circumstances; afterwards they separately and gradually invited cultivators to work in their respective lands, and to live in their respective shares of the village. These are now in law tenants-at-will; but the State would probably not suffer an old-established tenant to be ousted as a mere tenant-at-will might be, though, as a rule, no interference is exercised, and the narwadar may realize what he pleases from his tenants. The fruit-trees, grazing, etc., often yield a large additional profit, which is\nnot considered in the gross amount assessed by Government. The bh\u00e1g\u00e1d\u00e1ri tenure is somewhat different, though the bh\u00e1g\u00e1d\u00e1rs too are superior holders. But the lands of the village are measured and assessed, and the result is fixed as the revenue payable by the bh\u00e1g\u00e1d\u00e1rs, who are generally allowed to realize from the cultivators more than the sum paid to Government, on the supposition that they have to let poor lands at less than the Government rates. Again, some villages are held by landlords of the higher class called mehw\u00e1sis, each of whom pays for one or more villages a lump sum, settled by the State annually or from time to time, which does not as a rule interfere with the internal fiscal arrangements.\n\nA cultivator is seldom ousted for failure to pay the assessment. His private property is liable to be sold, but if he has no saleable property, he is suffered to pay by instalments. There is no rule as to the liability of land to attachment and sale for private debt. Implements of agriculture (including carts and oxen), also seed-grain, clothes and ornaments in ordinary use, and food sufficient for a reasonable time, belonging to a cultivator and his family, are exempted from the process of a civil court.\n\nMeans of Communication.\u2014The Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway passes through the territory at two points,\u2014it first enters the Navs\u00e1ri Division south of Surat, where are two stations, Navs\u00e1ri and Billimor\u00e1; north of Broach the railway again passes through Baroda territory from Miy\u00e1g\u00e1m to the Mahi river, in which section are the stations of Miy\u00e1g\u00e1m, Itol\u00e1, Baroda, and Bajwa. There are 59 miles of railway on the 2' 6\" gauge belonging to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r's Government, namely, a line from Baroda to Chandod, with branch lines from Dabhoi to Badarpur and to Miaj\u00e1g\u00e1m. The Western R\u00e1jput\u00e1na State Railway passes through the northern division of the State. There are only about 20 miles of made road. Common country tracks of the rudest description exist all over the State, but most of them are barely practicable for cart traffic during eight months of the year, owing to the sandy nature of the soil, and utterly impassable during the monsoon except for horses, pack-bullocks, and camels.\n\nAdministration, etc.\u2014The total revenue of the State in 1880\u201381 was estimated at \u00a31,118,232, composed of the following items:\u2014(1) Land revenue, \u00a3850,637; (2) Customs, \u00a393,815; (3) Taxes on caste and trade, \u00a330,897; (4) Abk\u00e1ri, including opium, \u00a341,835; (5) Forests, \u00a36951; (6) Tribute from Native States of Gujar\u00e1t and K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, \u00a363,767; (7) Justice, \u00a325,572; (8) Miscellaneous, \u00a34754. Of the total estimated revenue, \u00a31,067,692 was realized during the year, leaving a balance of only \u00a350,540; the greater portion of this balance being on account of land revenue.\n\nThe land revenue is paid in four instalments, viz. 1st December, 4\n\u00e1nn\u00e1s in the rupee; 2nd January, 6 \u00e1nn\u00e1s in the rupee; 3rd March, 4 \u00e1nn\u00e1s in the rupee; and 4th April, 2 \u00e1nn\u00e1s in the rupee: but in villages which produce cotton, wheat, oil-seeds, and such-like crops, and in which the cultivators belong to the Kanb\u00ed and cognate classes, the revenue is realized in three instalments, thus: 1st December, 2 \u00e1nn\u00e1s in the rupee; 2nd March, 8 \u00e1nn\u00e1s in the rupee; 3rd April, 6 \u00e1nn\u00e1s in the rupee. In villages inhabited by Kol\u00eds and other needy classes, the land revenue is collected in two equal payments.\n\nGeneral supervision in revenue matters is entrusted to an officer called the Sar S\u00fabh\u00e1 or Revenue Commissioner, who receives a monthly salary of \u00a3200. Under him are four officers, styled S\u00fabh\u00e1s, answering to the Collectors of a British District, each of whom has charge of one of the four Divisions of the State, and receives a salary varying from \u00a355 to \u00a3120 a month. Subordinate to the S\u00fabh\u00e1s are 10 Naibs or deputy S\u00fabh\u00e1s, corresponding to deputy or assistant collectors, each with the charge of a Sub-division, whose monthly pay varies from \u00a330 to \u00a345. The 10 Sub-divisions are again apportioned into 31 minor divisions, styled t\u00e1lukhs or mahals, managed by vahivat\u00edd\u00e1s or tahsild\u00e1s. On account of their size, 9 of the t\u00e1lukhs are further sub-divided into two portions, managed by sub-tahsild\u00e1s or mahalk\u00e1s.\n\nAt Baroda itself there is a Varisht Ad\u00e1lat, or High Court, presided over by a chief-justice, with a salary of \u00a3150 a month, and a second judge on a salary of \u00a3120. The jurisdiction of the Varisht Ad\u00e1lat extends throughout the whole territory, both in original suits and as a court of final appeal and revision in civil and criminal matters. There are 4 divisional judges, one at the head-quarters of each Division, with power to try original suits of upwards of \u00a3300 in value, and to hear civil and criminal appeals. There is a fifth judge for the city of Baroda, as well as a joint judge and an assistant judge. There is also at the capital a Sard\u00e1r\u2019s court, which takes cognisance of cases in which certain privileged classes, such as the members of the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r\u2019s family and the nobles of the State are concerned. There are 15 muns\u00edf\u00eds, with power to try civil suits up to \u00a3300. In 1880\u201381, the total number of suits was nearly 15,000, of which 12,500 were disposed of. The total value under litigation was \u00a3250,600; the amount of court fees, \u00a315,500.\n\nIn criminal matters the Varisht Ad\u00e1lat has power to inflict the following sentences:\u2014Fourteen years\u2019 imprisonment, fine to any amount, or both fine and imprisonment, and 30 stripes. Higher sentences require confirmation by His Highness the M\u00e1har\u00e1j\u00e1. The District judges may inflict 7 years\u2019 imprisonment, fine to any amount, and 30 stripes. The S\u00fabh\u00e1s or Collectors have the same powers. The Naib S\u00fabh\u00e1s are entrusted with power to inflict 2 years\u2019 imprisonment, and fine up to \u00a3100. The Vahivat\u00edd\u00e1s have power to inflict\n6 months' imprisonment, and fine up to \u00a320. There are also 3rd class magistrates and special magistrates. In the city of Baroda, there are 2 magistrates, one of whom may give 2 years' imprisonment and fine up to \u00a3100; the other, 6 months' imprisonment and fine up to \u00a320. The total number of criminal cases tried during 1880-81 was 7600. The total number of accused persons was, in round numbers, 15,000; the ratio of convictions was 39 per cent., and of acquittal 31 per cent.\n\nThe police of all the four Divisions, and of the city of Baroda, has been lately reorganized. There is a central jail in Baroda for life prisoners and those sentenced to long terms of imprisonment. In addition, there are 7 zil\u00e1 or District jails and 31 mahal or Subdivisional jails. In the central jail there were, on the 1st of April 1882, 506 prisoners.\n\nThe general administration is carried on in the following manner. The Diw\u00e1n or Prime Minister exercises supervision over every department. Under one officer are placed the political, military, and settlement departments; under another, the judicial, kh\u00e1ngi (private), general, and educational; under a third, the police, jail, municipality, medical, and public works; under a fourth, the audit, treasury, accounts, and mint. The salary of these four officers under the Diw\u00e1n varies from \u00a3100 to \u00a3150 a month. Almost every department in the State has been reorganized within the last few years, under the energetic administration of Sir T. M\u00e1dhava R\u00e1o, K.C.S.I., who was appointed Diw\u00e1n on the installation of the present G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r. Sir M\u00e1dhava R\u00e1o retired in 1883, and was succeeded by K\u00e1z\u00ed Sh\u00e1hab-ud-d\u00edn.\n\nAs an independent State, Baroda has from the earliest times exercised the prerogative of coinage at its own mint. The silver coins are termed the new syash\u00e1hi or b\u00e1b\u00e1sh\u00e1hi rupees; the copper coins, Baroda pice. The Baroda rupee is of the value of about 13 \u00e1nn\u00e1s 11 pies, British currency; or 114\u00bd b\u00e1b\u00e1sh\u00e1hi are equal to Rs. 100 or \u00a310. In the year ending July 1876, 3,356,438 b\u00e1b\u00e1sh\u00e1hi rupees were coined, representing a value of \u00a3293,138, and the net profit to the State was \u00a34252. In the year ending July 1882, 1,754,063 b\u00e1b\u00e1sh\u00e1hi rupees were coined, representing a value of \u00a3153,193, and the net profit to the State was \u00a32291. The Baroda coinage circulates throughout the State generally, and also in the adjoining countries of the Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1nth\u00e1. The old Broach coinage is still in circulation in Navs\u00e1ri Division. It is at present in contemplation to strike a coinage similar to the British, and to introduce machinery into the Baroda mint. The following is the rude process still adopted in coining:\u2014A large hole is made in the ground, in which is placed an earthenware vessel capable of containing 20,000 tol\u00e1s of silver; the metal is then poured with spoons into long, thin, shallow moulds, each containing from 10 to 20 tol\u00e1s of silver.\nAfter cooling, quantities of 100 to 500 tolas are handed over to the goldsmiths, who clean them and stamp them by hand.\n\nThe telegraph wire accompanies the railway throughout its course, and there is also a Government wire to Baroda.\n\nThere are 12 hospitals and 23 dispensaries in the whole State. Of these, 4 hospitals and 2 dispensaries are in the city of Baroda, and the remainder in the Districts, including those at the military stations of Okh\u00e1mandal and Dh\u00e1ri. The total number treated in 1880-81 was 6724 in-door, and 143,892 out-door patients. During the same year there were 31 vaccinators employed, who operated upon 61,170 persons.\n\nIn the year 1880-81, there were 192 educational institutions in the territory, either solely maintained at the cost of the State, or receiving grants-in-aid. The total expenditure to the State on account of education was Baroda Rupees 156,449, or about \u00a313,606, exclusive of expenditure on educational buildings. Of the 192 schools, 172 were Government institutions with 17,089 pupils, and 20 private schools receiving grants-in-aid, with 1252 pupils. Of the 172 Government schools 1 is a high school, 1 an Anglo-Indian institution, 7 Anglo-veracular schools, and 162 vernacular schools, including 8 schools for girls, and 9 Sanskrit schools of the indigenous type, in most of which some one of the Vedas, astronomy, grammar or logic are taught in the old Hindu fashion. The English department of education in the State is under the supervision of a European, whose salary is \u00a385 a month. A native is the Director of Vernacular Instruction, receiving a salary of \u00a350 per month. He is assisted by 2 inspectors of schools. The High School has a college division affiliated to the University of Bombay.\n\nThe Baroda State comprises 3720 towns and villages, including hamlets, besides the city of Baroda, of which 31 contain a population of more than 5000 inhabitants each.\n\nClimate.\u2014Over so wide a range of country, the climate necessarily varies much in character\u2014from the dry air and extreme fluctuations of temperature that mark the north of Guzer\u00e1t, to the moister and more equable climate of the south. From its open situation on the seacoast, Okh\u00e1mandal enjoys a healthy and bracing air, well suited to the European constitution. The climate of the central division, and of the city of Baroda itself, is comparatively moist, and during the rains very damp. The average annual rainfall is 42\u00b082 inches. The maximum temperature in Baroda city is about 105\u00b0 F. in the hottest time of the day in May or June, the minimum temperature about 80\u00b0. During the cold weather months, the temperature varies from a maximum of 92\u00b0 to a minimum of 59\u00b0. [For further information regarding Baroda, see the Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency, vol. vii., by F. A. H. Elliot, Esq, tutor to His Highness the Ga\u00e9kw\u00e1r\n(Bombay, 1883). Mr. Elliot's elaborate and admirably complete volume unfortunately reached me too late to be utilized in the preparation of this article, which is therefore substantially reproduced from the first edition of The Imperial Gazetteer, with statistics up to 1881.\n\n**Baroda.**\u2014Division of Baroda State, Guzer\u00e1t, Bombay Presidency, comprising the Districts of Baroda, Chor\u00e1nda, Jarod, Petlad, Padra, Dabhoi, Sinor, Sankheda, Tilakwara, and Ch\u00e1ndod. Population (1881) 654,989, namely, 349,283 males, and 305,706 females.\n\n**Baroda.**\u2014The chief city or capital of the territory of the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r, in 22\u00b0 17' 30\" N. lat., and 73\u00b0 16' E. long. It contains 24,027 houses, and a total population (1881) of 106,512, including 4694 persons returned as being in the cantonment. It is the second city of Guzer\u00e1t, and the third in the Bombay Presidency. It is situated east of the deep, sunk bed of the little river Visw\u00e1mitri, over whose tortuous course and side channels four stone bridges have been erected, leading from the cantonment to the town. The largest of these was thus referred to nearly a century ago by Mr. Forbes in his *Oriental Memoirs:*\u2014\u2018It is a stone bridge consisting of two ranges of arches over each other. I mention it because it is the only bridge of the kind I ever saw in India.\u2019 His description of the city, though somewhat highly coloured, needs but few alterations and additions. The beautiful trees by which it was then surrounded, still half conceal numerous temples and tombs, chiefly of Musalm\u00e1n noblemen, while here and there are fine wells, such as the *Nav L\u00e1kh ki B\u00e1wali*\u2014the Nine L\u00e1kh (or \u00a390,000) Well\u2014near the tomb of the Am\u00edn Sahib. \u2018The city proper is intersected by two spacious streets, dividing it into four equal parts, meeting in the centre in the market-place, which contains a square pavilion with three bold arches on each front. This pavilion is a Mughal building, as is everything else that has the smallest claim to grandeur and elegance. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 structures are mean and shabby\u2014none more so than the Darb\u00e1r finished by Fateh Singh, which resembles most Hindu palaces in want of taste and proportion of architecture and elegance in the interior decorations.\u2019\n\nThis condemnation of the last century applies equally to the palace built by the late Sy\u00e1ji Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1, and now occupied by the present G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r and his queen,\u2014a shapeless heap of crowded little rooms and narrow winding staircases. Immediately behind it and the pavilion already alluded to, towers high above the town the Nazar B\u00e1gh Palace, built by the late G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r Malh\u00e1r R\u00e1o, and now used as a treasure-house for the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r\u2019s jewels, valued at over three millions sterling. Although unduly crowded by the neighbouring houses, this lofty edifice has some architectural merit, and the interior is not wanting in finish. In the neighbourhood of the palace, but somewhat nearer\nthe Laripura gate, are collected most of the bankers' houses. But the wealthiest of the bankers, Mair\u00e1l, lives in the Muhammad W\u00e1di, a suburb probably named after the Guzer\u00e1t king to whom Baroda owes its early pre-eminence. Near the bankers live the jewellers, who drove a thriving trade during the reign of the late G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r. Behind the Nazar B\u00e1gh is situated the walled arena in which the athlete, the rhinoceros, the elephant, the buffalo, and the ram still fight\u2014though less frequently than of old\u2014for the amusement of the court and holiday-loving populace.\n\nOn one side of this arena, just beyond the Water-gate, are the aviaries and menageries; while on the other, but beyond the Champ\u00e1ner gate, is the filkh\u00e1n\u00e1, where, in the time of Khandi R\u00e1o, nearly one hundred elephants were kept at great expense, but now their number has been greatly reduced. Not far from this gate is the Sher Sh\u00e1h tank, one of the two large reservoirs on which Baroda is dependent for its water supply. It is connected by iron piping with the Sur S\u00e1g\u00e1r tank, near the Laripura gate; and both are fed by rain-water. The iron pipe was the work of Malh\u00e1r R\u00e1o, and by its means, the large fire which broke out in 1875 in the wealthy quarter of the town, was prevented from doing a vast amount of damage. There are no springs in the neighbourhood of Baroda, and the people depend upon wells for their drinking water, which is both insufficient and bad, owing to the entire absence of any system of drainage. Active measures were taken by the late minister, Sir T. Madhava R\u00e1o, to remedy these defects.\n\nThe large majority of the houses are of the meanest description, and so overcrowded, that the chief sanitary problem is how to devise accommodation for the large number of inhabitants. There is no doubt that the capital has much increased in size during the present century; and the impress of Musalm\u00e1n rule, so clearly distinguished by Mr. Forbes, is no longer visible. The chief houses are those in the suburb built by the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r's ministers and noblemen. Eighteen horse p\u00e1g\u00e1s\u2014large lines\u2014and Khandi R\u00e1o's parade ground cover a considerable portion of the area of the town, while the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r's gardens and garden palaces, situated to the west and south of the suburbs, form a striking feature of the place. Beyond the Khoti, within the suburbs, are the jail, the high school, and the Government offices. Three miles south of the Ghend\u00e1 (rhinoceros) gate of the city, is the Makarpur\u00e1 palace, built by Khandi R\u00e1o. Some new, large, and beautiful buildings, such as the Jamn\u00e1b\u00e1i Hospital, the Baroda State library, the public offices, the central jail, the Lakshmi Vil\u00e1s palace, the Baroda college, together with the public park situated between the cantonments and the city, have added greatly to the attractions of Baroda.\nBut most notable of all are the Hindu temples which crowd this religious city. Hard by the stone bridges are two temples to Siva; while numerous lesser shrines perpetuate divine honours rendered to those who have ruled the State\u2014the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1rs Govind R\u00e1o and Anand R\u00e1o, the R\u00e1n\u00eds Ghen\u00e1b\u00e1i, and the wife of the late G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r Malh\u00e1r R\u00e1o. In them may be seen either their images in stone life-size, or at least their feet as far as the ankle. These are the benefactors who instituted or continued the khichadi, or practice of giving food daily to thousands of male and female Br\u00e1hmans of the Deccan. This extravagant liberality was extended by Khandi R\u00e1o to the Musalm\u00e1n poor.\n\nThe chief State temples are those of Vithal Mandir, which has the largest allowances; Sw\u00e1m\u00ed N\u00e1r\u00e1yan\u2019s Mandir, a great edifice; the temple of Khandob\u00e1, the tutelary god of the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r\u2019s family; that of Bechar\u00e1j\u00ed and Bh\u00edmn\u00e1th, where Br\u00e1hmans undergo penance for the spiritual welfare of the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1rs and the confusion of their enemies, or daily read the Saptashati prayers to Mah\u00e1 K\u00e1li; the temples of Sidhn\u00e1th, K\u00e1l\u00edk\u00e1, and Bol\u00e1i, and Lakshman B\u00e1w\u00e1\u2019s R\u00e1m Mandir. The Guzer\u00e1tis have their temples, such as that of N\u00e1rsajk, Gobardh\u00e1n N\u00e1thj\u00ed, Baldew\u00e1j\u00ed, the Ganpati Mandir, and the temple of K\u00e1shi Visheshwar.\n\nThe city proper within the walls is divided into 17 streets or quarters, which extend farthest towards the west, that is, in the direction of the river and the cantonment. Here are the Modi Kh\u00e1n\u00e1 or G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r\u2019s commissariat; the quarters named after Sy\u00e1j\u00ed; after R\u00e1oj\u00ed Ap\u00e1j\u00ed, the Minister who called in the English, in which the Mazumd\u00e1r and the Naw\u00e1b of Baroda, a descendant of Mir Kam\u00e1l-ud-d\u00edn, live; after Gang\u00e1dhar Sh\u00e1stri, whose murder led to the rupture between the English and the last Peshw\u00e1; after Anand R\u00e1o; and after B\u00e1bj\u00ed, the brother of R\u00e1oj\u00ed Ap\u00e1j\u00ed.\n\nThe northern suburbs are composed of 12 quarters or streets, the chief of which, named after Fateh Singh, contains the house of Bh\u00e1u Sindhi\u00e1, the Minister of the late Khandi R\u00e1o, the stables, the carriage-houses, and the H\u00e1thi Kh\u00e1n\u00e1 of the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r, as well as one of the two schools of athletes. The eastern suburb consists of only 5 streets or quarters, and comprises the arena, the menageries, and Anand R\u00e1o\u2019s old palace. The southern suburbs are divided into 11 streets or quarters, one of which, the Muhammad W\u00e1di, is inhabited by the Farnav\u00eds, the first officer in the State by rank, and by the heir of the great banker Gop\u00e1l R\u00e1o Mair\u00e1l; there are also quarters named after Khandob\u00e1\u2019s temple, and the Musalm\u00e1n fortification called the Monkey\u2019s Tower. There is a good library in the city of Baroda, near the public offices, with a branch in the middle of the city.\n\nThe Census of 1881 gives Baroda city a population of 101,818, and Baroda cantonment a population of 4694 persons; total, 106,512.\nThe Hindus numbered 84,042, and included the following castes:\u2014Br\u00e1hmans, 17,155; R\u00e1jputs, 2001; other Hindus, 64,886, of whom 43,857 belonged to low castes, and the remainder to agriculturists, artisans, and castes of good social position. The Muhammadans numbered 19,149, being 17,000 Sunnis and 2148 Shi\u00e1s. The Musalm\u00e1ns proper comprise Path\u00e1ns, negroes, and Arabs, the relics, perhaps, of the mercenary troops largely enlisted at one time by the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r.\n\nThe city has now been placed under a sanitary and a municipal commissioner, who has organized the necessary conservancy, lighting, watering, and other sanitary arrangements at an annual cost of Baroda Rs. 192,700, or \u00a317,266. The whole area is considered the property of Government. Unless a document called a kab\u00edl\u00e1 is shown, all owners of land pay a tax at the rate of 1s. per foot; if the proprietor can produce a kab\u00edl\u00e1 for a portion only of his property, the excess land is charged at 3d. per foot in order to prevent encroachments; but this tax has been long in abeyance. The survey made is of course a rough one only, but the income derived from this source amounts to \u00a3200 a year. Permission to build or rebuild houses is granted on payment of 2s. (Rs. 1); to open doors and windows, at 10s. (Rs. 5) per 2 feet, or 1 gaz. The income from this source is about \u00a3108 a year.\n\n**Baroda.**\u2014Large and flourishing agricultural village in Goh\u00e1na tahsil, Rohtak District, Punjab, situated on the But\u00e1na branch of the Western Jumna Canal, in lat. 29\u00b0 9' 30\" N., long. 76\u00b0 40' 30\" E. Population (1881) 5900, namely, 5603 Hindus, 14 Jains, and 283 Muhammadans. Area of town site, 693 acres.\n\n**Barodsair.**\u2014Town in Gwalior Territory, Central India. Population (1881) 6787.\n\n**Baronda.**\u2014Petty State in Bundelkhand, Central India Agency.\u2014See Baraunda.\n\n**Barot (Baraut).**\u2014Ancient town in Meerut (Merath) District, North-Western Provinces; distant 27 miles from Meerut; lies on the left bank of the Eastern Jumna Canal, amid a perfect network of distributaries, which somewhat interfere with the natural lines of drainage, but steps are being taken to remedy this defect. Lat. 29\u00b0 6' 5\" N., long. 77\u00b0 18' 35\" E. Population (1881) 7956, namely, 4682 Hindus, 2127 Muhammadans, 1142 Jains, and 5 Christians. Area of town site, 62 acres. Municipal income (1880-81) \u00a3765, mainly derived from octroi duties; expenditure, \u00a3839. Said to have been founded in the eighth century. Contains two markets, two b\u00e1z\u00e1rs, ancient fort now used as a police station, post-office, school, handsome Hindu and Jain temple, many brick-built houses inhabited by Saraugi bankers; declining trade in gh\u00ed and safflower; manufacture of buckets and iron caldrons. The J\u00e1ts of Barot were conspicuous for disloyalty during the Mutiny, and their estates were confiscated on the restoration of order.\nBarp\u00e1li.\u2014Estate or zamind\u00e1ri attached to Sambalpur District, Central Provinces; 24 miles south-west of the town of Sambalpur, with 86 villages, and an area of about 180 square miles, of which not quite three-fourths are cultivated. The whole zamind\u00e1ri is a flat, open, and richly cultivated tract, yielding a revenue of \u00a3830 to the chief, who pays a tribute of \u00a390 to the Government. The population in 1881 numbered 29,163, the prevailing castes being Kult\u00e1s or agriculturists, Ladras or carriers, and Bhulias or weavers. Chief products\u2014rice, cotton, oil-seeds, pulses, and sugar-cane; manufactures\u2014coarse cloth, tasar silk, and brass vessels. The estate was granted about 1620 by Ratan Singh, the sixth R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sambalpur, to his brother Bikram Singh, on a rent-free tenure; and it has since descended in the regular line of succession to the present zamind\u00e1r, now (1883) a well-educated young man of about 30 years of age.\n\nBarp\u00e1li.\u2014Town in Sambalpur District, Central Provinces, and headquarters of Barp\u00e1li estate, situated in lat. 21\u00b0 11' N., long. 83\u00b0 37' 45\" E. Population (1881) 4125, namely, Hindus, 4023; Muhamm\u00e1dans, 72; and aboriginal tribes, 30. The tasar silk cloth woven here holds a high reputation in the surrounding country. The chief, who is an honorary magistrate, holds his court in Barp\u00e1li town. Anglo-vernacular school.\n\nBarpet\u00e1.\u2014Sub-division in the north-west of K\u00e1mr\u00e1n District, Assam. Area, 206 square miles; population (1881) 133,039, namely, Hindus, 127,738; Muhamm\u00e1dans, 5283; and 'others,' 9; number of villages, 612; number of occupied houses, 27,172. The Sub-division, which was constituted in March 1841, consists of the two police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s) of Barpet\u00e1 and Baj\u00e1l\u00ed. It contained, in 1883, 2 civil and 2 criminal courts, with a regular police force of 36 men.\n\nBarpet\u00e1.\u2014Chief town of Barpet\u00e1 Sub-division, in the north of K\u00e1mr\u00e1n District, Assam; on the Ch\u00e1ul-Khoy\u00e1 river, a tributary of the Brahmaputra. Lat. 26\u00b0 19' 45\" N., long. 91\u00b0 3' 20\" E.; population (1881), with surrounding villages, 13,758, namely, Hindus, 13,752, and Muhamm\u00e1dans, 56. There is a considerable river-borne trade in rice, oil-seeds, cotton, caoutchouc, etc.\n\nBarrackpur.\u2014Sub-division of the District of the Twenty-four Par-gan\u00e1s, Bengal, lying between 22\u00b0 40' 30\" and 22\u00b0 49' 30\" N. lat., and between 88\u00b0 22' 45\" and 88\u00b0 30' E. long.; area, 42 square miles, with 67 villages and 15,413 inhabited houses; population (1881) 62,417, namely, 42,866 Hindus, 18,603 Muhamm\u00e1dans, 907 Christians, and 41 Buddhists; average density of population, 1,486 per square mile; villages per square mile, 1.60; houses per square mile, 408; persons per village, 930; persons per house, 4.0. The Sub-division consists of the th\u00e1n\u00e1s (police circles) of Barrackpur and Naw\u00e1bganj.\n\nBarrackpur.\u2014Town and cantonment in the District of the Twenty-\nfour Pargan\u00e1s, Bengal; on the H\u00fagl\u00ed river, 15 miles above Calcutta. Lat. 22\u00b0 45' 40\" N., long. 88\u00b0 23' 52\" E. Population (1881), including Naw\u00e1bganj, 17,702, namely, 14,050 Hindus, 3623 Muhammadans, and 29 'others.' The name of the place is said to be derived from the fact of troops having been stationed here since 1772. The natives call Barrackpur 'Ch\u00e1nak,' after Job Charnock, the founder of Calcutta, who built a bungalow here, in which he occasionally lived, and established a small b\u00e1z\u00e1r (1689). To the south of the cantonment is Barrackpur Park, which is laid out with much taste. Within this park is the suburban residence of the Viceroy of India, built by Lord Minto and enlarged by the Marquis of Hastings; and also the tomb of Lady Canning. Military force stationed in the cantonment on the 16th of September 1882\u20141 battery of Royal Artillery, consisting of 8 officers and 150 men, a detachment of European and a regiment of Native infantry.\n\nBarrackpur has played an important part in two Sepoy mutinies. In 1824, when Bengal troops were required to take part in the Burmese war, the 47th Bengal Infantry, which was stationed here, was warned for foreign service. Though at first willing enough to march, a greatly exaggerated account of the check received by the British troops at R\u00e1mu cooled their enthusiasm; and when a lying story was circulated, that, owing to the failure of the efforts of the Commissariat Department to obtain land transport, the men were to be put on board ship and taken to Rangoon by sea, the excitement, which had been gradually gaining force, developed into a determination to resist. In spite of the attempts at conciliation made by Colonel Cartwright, who commanded the regiment, they mutinied on parade on the 30th October, declaring that they would not go to Burma by sea, and that they would not march unless allowed 'double batta.' A second time (on the 1st November) the Sepoys were mutinous on parade; and the following morning Sir Edward Paget, the commander-in-chief, after an ineffectual attempt at explanation, told the Sepoys that they must either obey the order to march or ground their arms. They refused, and a battery of European artillery, which Sir Edward Paget had brought with him, supported by two English regiments, opened upon the mutineers. They broke at once, and made for the river, throwing away their arms. Some of them were shot, some drowned, and others hanged; and the number of the regiment was removed from the Army List.\n\nBarrackpur was again the scene of mutiny in 1857. Early in that year the excitement about the alleged pollution of the new cartridges had made itself felt in every military station, and many of the Sepoys firmly believed that the English were deliberately plotting to destroy the caste of the native soldier, and to force him to embrace Christianity. A thousand absurd rumours obtained ready credence, despite the endeavours of General Hearsey, commanding the division, to allay\nthe fears of the men. Incendiaryism, clearly traced to the troops, had become common. The excitement grew more intense from week to week, until, on the 29th March, the crisis was brought about by a private of the 34th Native Infantry, named Mangal Pande, who attempted to kill one of the officers, Lieutenant Baugh, fired at a European sergeant-major, and called upon his comrades to join him. These outrages were committed within a few yards of the quarter-guard, where a native officer and 20 men were on duty, but no steps were taken to interfere. The regiment was disbanded with ignominy on the 6th of May, Mangal Pande and the native officer in charge of the guard having been previously tried by court-martial and hanged. A full account of these events will be found in Sir John Kaye's History of the Sepoy War, vol. i. pp. 266-269, 495 sq.\n\nBarsana.\u2014Town in Muttra (Mathura) District, North-Western Provinces, situated in lat. 27\u00b0 29' N., and long. 77\u00b0 24' E., lying at the foot and on the slope of a small ridge near the border of Bharatpur State, the summit of the ridge being crowned with temples in honour of Radha, the wife of Krishna. Half-way down the slope, a long flight of steps leads to the temple of Mahiban, Radha's grandfather. The town was founded in the early part of the last century, and flourished till the middle of the present century, but it is now in ruins. Remains of ancient buildings and of sacred bathing tanks.\n\nBarsi.\u2014Sub-division of Sholapur District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 596 square miles, containing 1 town and 122 villages. Population (1881) 110,046, of whom 55,242 were returned as males, and 54,804 as females. Of Hindus there are 101,588; of Muhammadans, 7456; and of 'others,' 1002.\n\nBarsi.\u2014Chief town of the Sub-division of Barsi, in Sholapur District, Bombay Presidency; distant 43 miles north of Sholapur, and 128 miles east of Poona (Puna). Lat. 18\u00b0 13' 30\" N., and long. 75\u00b0 44' 30\" E.; population (1882) 16,126, namely, Hindus, 14,026; Muhammadans, 1682; Jains, 321; Christians, 46; and Parsis, 11; area of town site, 240 acres. Municipal revenue (1881-82) \u00a35,325; rate of taxation, 3s. 8\u00bdd. per head. Expenditure (1880-81) \u00a31,781. Considerable trade is carried on at Barsi, the staples being cotton, linseed, and oil, exported chiefly to Bombay.

The chief articles of wholesale trade are dried fish, tortoises, treacle (gur), country-made cloth, chilies, turmeric, and onions. These commodities are bought in considerable quantities by *paik\u00e1s* or petty traders, who retail them throughout the District. Gunny-bags and mats, locally manufactured, are also largely sold at the market. The village is a police outpost station.\n\n**B\u00e1r\u00fadpura.**\u2014Th\u00e1kurate or petty State in Central India.\u2014See Bharudpura.\n\n**B\u00e1ruipur.**\u2014Until recently a Sub-division of the District of the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s District, Bengal; lying between 21\u00b0 30' 45\" and 22\u00b0 30' N. lat.; and between 88\u00b0 25' 15\" and 88\u00b0 50' 45\" E. long.

Station on the Diamond Harbour Railway.\n\n**B\u00e1rul.**\u2014Iron ore field in Bardw\u00e1n District, Bengal. B\u00e1rul is a village in the middle of the iron tract (lat. 23\u00b0 44' N., long. 87\u00b0 9' E.), and for the sake of convenience the name is applied to the whole field. Bounded as follows:\u2014On the north, Churuli\u00e1; on the east, J\u00e1msol; on the west and south, Satur, to within about half a mile of the village of R\u00e1jpur. Throughout this entire area, iron ore of excellent quality has been found. According to a careful estimate made by a skilled\ninspector in 1855, each square mile should yield 6\u00bd millions of tons of iron ore, capable of producing in pig iron no less than 1,600,000 tons, 'equal to the make of eight furnaces, at 70 tons per week, for a period, in round numbers, of rather more than 59 years.' The only serious difficulty in the way of the profitable manufacture of iron is the scarcity of flux. The whole subject is carefully discussed in a Report published in 1856 by Mr. David Smith, Government iron and coal viewer, who had been deputed to report on the iron deposits in Bardw\u00e1n District, and on the suitability of the local coal for the manufacture of iron. The portion of his report referring to this field is quoted fully in the Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. iv. pp. 125-133.\n\nB\u00e1run\u00edbunt\u00e1.\u2014Hills in Cuttack District, Bengal; the highest range in the District.

This pargan\u00e1 formerly yielded a revenue of \u00a37000 from 20 villages. In 1824, the revenue amounted to little more than \u00a32300. The town of B\u00e1rwai is situated about a mile north of the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda), and 32 miles east of Mahesar, the lands about it are extremely fertile, and the town being a station of the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na-M\u00e1lw\u00e1 railway, is rising in importance, and being restored to its former condition. Transferred to Holkar in 1867, together with Dharg\u00e1o\u0144, Khasr\u00e1w\u00e1da, and Mandlesar.\n\nBarw\u00e1la.\u2014Town in Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bombay Presidency; on the left bank of the river Utauli, 80 miles south-west of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d. Lat. 22\u00b0 8' 15\" N., long. 71\u00b0 57' 30\" E.; population (1881) 5813. The\ntown is surrounded with a fine wall. Population under five thousand.

Population (1881) 3628. Surrounding ruins testify the former importance of this town, which is now merely a local centre of no commercial consideration. Tahsili, police station, post-office. Principal inhabitants, Sayyids, who own the neighbouring country.\n\n**Barw\u00e1n.**\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Hardoi District, Oudh; bounded on the north by Saromannagar and P\u00e1li pargan\u00e1s, east by B\u00e1wan, south by S\u00e1ndi, and west by Kati\u00e1ri pargan\u00e1s. According to local tradition, the country was originally held by the Thatheras, who were afterwards expelled by the Sombans\u00eds. They in their turn gave way before the Muhammadans; but in the beginning of the 15th century, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Barw\u00e1n, grandson of the Sombansi chief who had fled to the Kum\u00e1un Hills, was allowed by the Governor of Kanauj to resume possession of his grandfather's domain, and to establish himself at Baburhia, the deserted capital of the Thatheras, which he re-named Barw\u00e1n. For a time the country was held by two brothers, descendants of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Barw\u00e1n, who refused to pay tribute, and resisted all attempts at coercion. Eventually they were persuaded to send their sons to Akbar's court, where they so distinguished themselves by military service in the Deccan that the Emperor bestowed upon them a formal rent-free grant of the pargan\u00e1, together with the title of Kh\u00e1n. The Sombans\u00eds have held Barw\u00e1n uninterruptedly for 4\u00bd centuries, and are still in possession of 68 out of the 69 villages which comprise the pargan\u00e1. They have always given much trouble to the revenue authorities, and were until recent years notorious thieves and cattle-lifters. Physically, Barw\u00e1n may be described as a backward, roadless, and somewhat inaccessible pargan\u00e1, lying along both sides of the Garra river, between the central bangar or high lands and the low-lying kachh country along the Ganges and R\u00e1mgang\u00e1. To the east the country consists of a high irregular ridge of sand, sinking westward into a low and fertile marshy tract watered by winding streams and jhils, and overgrown here and there with patches of dh\u00e1k jungle. Area, 53 square miles, of which 33 are cultivated. Government land revenue demand,\n\u00a32843, 10s.; average incidence, 2s. 8\u00bdd. per acre of cultivated area, or 1s. 8\u00bcd. per acre of total area. Population (1881) 17,490, namely, 10,244 males and 7246 females. The percentage of females to males among the agricultural population is the lowest in any of the Oudh pargans. Number of villages, 69. Five village schools, including one for girls.\n\nBarw\u00e1n.\u2014Town in Hardoi District, Oudh; on the right bank of the Garra river, 13 miles west of Hardoi, and 19 miles east of Fatehgarh. The fort was destroyed on the re-occupation of the country after the Mutiny. Barw\u00e1n is now an insignificant village of 216 mud huts, with a population (1881) of 1552. It has but little trade of its own, but considerable quantities of cotton, grain, timber, hides, and sugar pass down the Garra from Bareilly, Shahjah\u00e1npur, An\u00fapshahr, and Pilibhit, on their way to Cawnpur, Mirz\u00e1pur, and Benares. Government school.\n\nBarw\u00e1ni.\u2014State under the Deputy Bh\u00edl (Bheel) Agency of Central India. It lies north of Kh\u00e1ndesh, on the left bank of the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) river, between lat. 21\u00b0 41' and 22\u00b0 9' N., and long. 74\u00b0 29' and 75\u00b0 22' E. The country abounds in fine timber and is well watered by mountain streams, but only partially cultivated. Area, 1362 square miles; population (1881) 56,445 (mostly Bhils), distributed in 1 town and 299 villages, and occupying 10,216 houses; number of persons per square mile, 41.4. Of the total population, Hindus number 44,818; Muhammadans, 2632; Jains, 381; Christians, 9; and aboriginal tribes, 8605. Revenue, about \u00a313,000. The Chiefs of this State are Sesodia R\u00e1jputs of the Udaipur (Oodeypore) family, who separated from the parent stock about the 14th century. Their history is enveloped in obscurity. According to local tradition, they settled on the banks of the Narbad\u00e1 in the 11th century. P\u00e1r\u00e1s R\u00e1m, the 15th in ascent from the present chief, opposed the advance of the imperial armies on M\u00e1lw\u00e1, and was carried away prisoner to Delhi, where he consented to embrace Muhammadanism, on condition of his being permitted to return to his ancestral State. On his return, he retired into seclusion, and was succeeded by his son Bhim Singh, who erected a Muhammadan tomb over his father's remains, which may be seen to this day, at Awasgarh.\n\nScattered remains of forts, towns, and irrigation works testify to the ancient prosperity of the State. From the beginning of the last century the power of the chiefs of Barw\u00e1ni gradually declined. Their country, originally of considerable extent, was devastated by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and at length only a strip of the S\u00e1tpura range, 80 miles in length, with the lowlands on either side, remained to them. They did not, however, become tributary to any of the M\u00e1lw\u00e1 chiefs. In 1860, owing to the incapacity of the then chief (Jaswant Singh), the State was taken under British management, and so remained till 1873,\nwhen it was restored to the chief on the understanding that his continuance in power would depend on his ability to administer his State rightly. Jaswant Singh died on the 15th of August 1880, and was succeeded by his brother Indarjit, the present ruler. Barw\u00e1ni pays no tribute to, and receives no allowance from, the British Government. It pays Hali Rs. 4000 per annum towards the cost of the M\u00e1lw\u00e1 Bh\u00edl Corps. The chief receives a salute of nine guns, and holds the title of R\u00e1n\u00e1. The whole State is intersected by the S\u00e1tpura range, and parts of it are so malarious that even the Bhils cannot live there with impunity. The forest tract of 984 square miles in the State contains excellent timber, and yields a revenue of about \u00a31300 yearly. Large game abounds. There are three main lines of road within the State, also 12 schools attended by 450 pupils. Chief town, Barw\u00e1ni.\n\nBarw\u00e1ni.\u2014Chief town of the State of the same name under the Central India Agency, situated 2 miles from the south or left bank of the Narbad\u00e1. It is surrounded by a double wall, with a ditch to the outer one. Population (1881) 5581. There are some Jain temples on the Bawangaja Hill, distant about 5 miles from the town, and a fair is held in January in connection with these temples.\n\nBarwar.\u2014Town in Kheri District, Oudh. Lat. 27\u00b0 50' N., long. 80\u00b0 24' E.; population (1881) 3683, namely, Hindus, 2654, and Muhammadans, 1029. Situated on an open, fertile plain, surrounded by groves and highly cultivated fields. Remains of a brick fort, built by Naw\u00e1b Mukhtadar Kh\u00e1n; 4 mosques; and 1 Hindu temple. Manufacture of sugar.\n\nBarwa S\u00e1g\u00e1r.\u2014Town in Jh\u00e1nsi District, North-Western Provinces; distant 12 miles from Jh\u00e1nsi, on the Nowgong (Naug\u00e1on) road. Lat. 25\u00b0 22' 35\" N., long. 78\u00b0 46' 35\" E. Population (1881) 6315, namely, 6027 Hindus, 204 Muhammadans, and 84 Jains. Area of town site, 134 acres. A small municipal revenue is raised under the provisions of Act xx. of 1856. The town is picturesquely situated at the foot of a rocky ridge on the shore of the Barwa S\u00e1g\u00e1r Lake, an artificial sheet of water formed by a masonry embankment three-quarters of a mile in length, and containing two craggy, wooded islets. Flights of steps lead down from the embankment to the water's edge. Below, a tract of land, extending over 4 miles, is thickly planted with mango and other trees, often of great age and enormous size. The work was constructed by Udit Singh, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Orchha, between 1705 and 1737. Irrigation canals, several miles in length, have been excavated from the edge of the lake, but are now of little use owing to leakage. North-west of the town rises a fine old castle overlooking the lake, also built by Udit Singh, now used as a d\u00e1k bungalow or travellers' rest-house. Its last occupant was the celebrated R\u00e1n\u00ed of Jh\u00e1nsi. Three miles west stand\nthe remains of an old Chandel temple, built of solid blocks of stone, carved with the figures of Hindu gods, much defaced by Musalm\u00e1ns. The town consists of three divisions, separated by stretches of cultivated land, and the houses are prettily embosomed in foliage. First-class police station, post-office, staging bungalow. Income under Act xx. of 1856, \u00a360 in 1881; incidence of taxation, 2\u00bdd. per head.\n\n**Bas\u00e1hari.**\u2014Town in Khur\u00e1i tahsil, S\u00e1g\u00e1r District, Central Provinces. Population (1881) 2059, namely, Hindus, 1929; Muhammadans, 50; and Jains, 80.\n\n**Basantar.**\u2014Stream in Gurd\u00e1sipur District, Punjab; fed by numerous hill torrents, and itself falling into the R\u00e1vi a few miles east of the Ben. Carries a large volume of water in the rains; much used for purposes of irrigation.\n\n**Basanti\u00e1.**\u2014Village in Jess\u00f3r District, Bengal; on the Bhairab river, 12 miles east of Jess\u00f3r town. Lat. 23\u00b0 8' N., long. 89\u00b0 24' E. Being the nearest point to Jess\u00f3r to which boats of large size can come, it may be said to serve as a port to that town, with a considerable trade in sugar, and in the import of rice. Much country traffic is also carried on by road between Basanti\u00e1 and Jess\u00f3r.\n\n**Basantpur.**\u2014Trading village at the confluence of the K\u00e1lind\u00ed and Jam\u00fan\u00e1 rivers, on the northern boundary of Khuln\u00e1 District, Bengal. Lat. 22\u00b0 27' 30\" N., long. 89\u00b0 2' 15\" E. Being the point of convergence of the two great boat routes between Calcutta and Eastern Bengal (known as the Inner and Outer Sundarban Passage), it is an important trading place, and does much business with the Eastern Districts, principally in paddy. All boats put in here for provisions and fresh water, and also for repairs. There is good anchorage for country craft of any burthen.\n\n**Basantpur.**\u2014Village in Muzaffarpur District, Bengal. Lat. 26\u00b0 1' N., long. 85\u00b0 7' E.; population (1881) 5107, namely, 4774 Hindus and 333 Muhammadans. Area, 2646 acres. The village is close to the main road leading from L\u00e1lganj to S\u00e1hibganj. A little to the north of it is the Kewalpur\u00e1 outwork of the Sary\u00e1 indigo factory.\n\n**Baser\u00e1** (or **Baseda**).\u2014Village in Muzaffarnagar District, North-Western Provinces; 11 miles from Muzaffarnagar town. Population (1881) 3868, chiefly J\u00e1ts. The village is tolerably well kept, and the villagers\u2014agriculturists\u2014are generally prosperous. Good well-water found 33 feet below surface.\n\n**Bashahr.**\u2014One of the Punjab Hill States, lying between 31\u00b0 6' 30\" and 32\u00b0 4' 30\" N. lat., and between 77\u00b0 32' 15\" and 79\u00b0 2' 30\" E. long.; area, 3320 square miles. Population (1881) 64,345, namely, Hindus, 63,924; Muhammadans, 365; Jains, 33; Christians, 22; and Buddhist, 1. Number of occupied houses, 8533. Average density of population, 19 per square mile; estimated revenue, \u00a34000, excluding assignments\nof land revenue. Between 1803 and 1815, Bashahr was held in subjection by the conquering Gurkh\u00e1s. On the overthrow of the Gurkh\u00e1 power in 1815, the British Government confirmed the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bashahr, by a sanad, in possession of all his territories, except Rawain, which was transferred to Keunth\u00e1l, subject to the payment of \u00a31,500 per annum. In 1847, the tribute was reduced to \u00a3394, as compensation for the abolition of transit duties. The present R\u00e1j\u00e1, Shamsher Singh, succeeded in 1849. He traces back his descent for 120 generations. The family are R\u00e1jputs. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 is required to furnish troops in aid of the British Government in time of war, and labour for the construction of roads in the Bashahr territory. Sentences of death require confirmation; other punishments are awarded by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 on his own authority.\n\nB\u00e1si.\u2014Town in Am\u00edrgarh tahsil, Pati\u00e1l\u00e1 State, Punjab.

Number of occupied houses, 839.\n\nB\u00e1sim (IV\u00e1sim).\u2014District of Ber\u00e1r, in the West Ber\u00e1r Division, under the jurisdiction of the Resident at Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d in the Deccan; lying between 19\u00b0 26' and 20\u00b0 31' N. lat., and between 76\u00b0 39' and 78\u00b0 7' E. long.; extreme length from north-west to south-east, about 96 miles; average width, 30 miles. Bounded on the north by Akola and Amr\u00e1oti Districts; on the south by the Pengang\u00e1 river and the Niz\u00e1m's Dominions; on the east by W\u00fan District; and on the west by Buld\u00e1n\u00e1 District. Area, 2958 square miles, of which 1797 square miles were returned in 1880-81 as cultivated, 177 square miles as cultivable, and 984 square miles as uncultivable waste. Population in 1881, 358,883, or 121.3 per square mile of area. Number of villages on the Government rent-roll, 950. Land revenue (1881) \u00a359,356; total revenue (gross) \u00a371,283. The District is sub-divided into three t\u00e1luk for fiscal purposes, viz. B\u00e1sim, Mangr\u00fal, and Pus\u00e1d. The ancient town of Basim is the administrative head-quarters of the District, and also of the t\u00e1luk of the same name.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014B\u00e1sim, the more westerly of the three t\u00e1luk of the District, is a rich table-land about 1000 feet above sea-level; Mangr\u00fal, the north-eastern, and Pus\u00e1d, the south-eastern t\u00e1luk, are mainly a succession of low hills covered with poor grass. The soil of the hollows between the hills is usually of the best quality. Many of the hill peaks rise to a height of 2000 feet. Iron ore is plentiful throughout the high lands; and along the ranges of the Pus\u00e1d t\u00e1luk stretch wide slopes of woodland containing many patches of young teak, almost all shoots from stumps of old trees, about 12 inches in girth 6 feet from the\nground, and about 20 feet high. No valuable timber now exists. The best is to be found between the P\u00fas and the Pengang\u00e1 rivers. The area of reserved forests in 1880-81 was 48 square miles, and of unreserved forests 459 square miles. Several of the forest trees yield gums, dyes, and medicines, and the jungles supply abundant fuel. The mango, the mahu\u00e1, and other fruit trees are found in all the village lands except those of the western parg\u00e1ns. The two principal rivers are the P\u00fas and the K\u00e1ta P\u00farna, mountain streams which rise close to each other at the village of K\u00e1ta, north of B\u00e1sim town. The P\u00fas flowing south falls into the Pengang\u00e1 after a course of about 64 miles. The K\u00e1ta P\u00farna flowing north enters Akola District near Mh\u00e1n, after forcing its way through a deep gorge. Other insignificant streams are the Adan, the K\u00fach, the Adol, and the Chandra-B\u00e1gha, the last three falling into the Pengang\u00e1. The old military road between J\u00e1lna and N\u00e1gpur intersects the District from south-west to north-east. The larger wild animals are tigers, leopards, bears, wild hog, several varieties of deer; small game abounds.\n\n**History:**\u2014The only materials for the early history of the District are such as may possibly be found on further examination of the Jain and Buddhist sculptured temples of Sirpur and Pus\u00e1d, etc. According to historic tradition, the Jains were in power immediately before the Muhammadan invasion of Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn, A.D. 1294, who subjugated Ellichpur and its dependencies, in which B\u00e1sim was included. Thenceforward, though with intervals of partially regained independence, the country continued subject to Muhammadan rule till 1596, when Ber\u00e1r was ceded to Prince Mur\u00e1d on behalf of his father, Akbar, by Chand Sult\u00e1na, regent for her son. The condition of affairs calling for Akbar\u2019s presence, he personally visited the Deccan in 1599, and consolidated his conquests by making Ber\u00e1r an Imperial governorship, of which B\u00e1sim formed a Sark\u00e1r (Division). It does not appear to have been the scene of any remarkable event influencing the fortunes of its rulers.\n\nThe hills north of the Pengang\u00e1 are inhabited by Hatk\u00e1rs\u2014Bargi Dhangars, or \u2018the shepherds with the spears.\u2019 These men, in 1600, held sway in the country round B\u00e1sim, and are described as a \u2018refractory and perfidious\u2019 race. They were, in truth, clans under highland chiefs, who owned little more than nominal allegiance to the lowland rulers, whether Hindu or Muhammadan; and thus they continued till the introduction of British rule. After the death of Akbar, the Mughal Emperors maintained their authority with more or less vigour till about 1670, when the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 forays became frequent. In 1671, Prat\u00e1p R\u00e1o, a general of Sivaji, plundered as far east as Karinj\u00e1, just beyond the north-east corner of B\u00e1sim District, and first exacted from the village officers a pledge to pay chauth. After the death of Aurangzeb, chauth and sardesh mukhi\nwere formally granted (1717) to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s by Farukh Siyyar. In 1724, Chin Khilich Kh\u00e1n, viceroy of the Deccan, under the title of Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk, gained a crowning victory over the Imperial forces, which gave him the supremacy in the Province, which he and his descendants thereafter held in part ownership with the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, who took 60 per cent. of the revenue when they could. In 1795, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s compelled the acceptance of onerous terms of accommodation entailing large cessions of territory, of which Um\u00e1rkhed in B\u00e1sim District was a portion, and a cash payment of \u00a33,000,000. That portion of the Ber\u00e1r made over to the Niz\u00e1m by the partition treaty of 1804, included B\u00e1sim, which was plundered by Pind\u00e1ris in 1809. The N\u00e1iks of the District, too, had become breakers instead of guardians of the peace, and in 1819 Nows\u00e1ji Na\u00edk Muski gave battle to the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s regular troops under Major Pitman before Um\u00e1rkhed. He was driven into his stronghold, Nowa (garrisoned by 500 Arabs), which was carried by assault after a gallant defence, and Nows\u00e1ji Naik was sent to Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, where he died.\n\nBy the treaty of 1822, between the British and the Niz\u00e1m, Um\u00e1rkhed pargan\u00e1, which had belonged to the Peshw\u00e1, was transferred to the Niz\u00e1m. The administration of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d State for many years of this century had fallen into great disorder, and the British Government had to advance the pay of the contingent maintained in accordance with the treaty of 1800, although they had other unsatisfied claims against the Niz\u00e1m. To meet these difficulties, the treaty of 1853 was concluded, whereby the Districts (of which B\u00e1sim is one) now known as Ber\u00e1r were assigned to the British. This treaty has been modified by a second treaty in 1860\u201361. In 1859, a band of plundering Rohill\u00e1s was pursued by a detachment of the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d Contingent into the village of Chichamba, near Risod, in B\u00e1sim t\u00e1luk, where behind walls they resisted an assault by the fatigued troops, in which Captain Mackinnon was killed.\n\n**Population.**\u2014The Census of 1881 showed a population of 358,883, and an area of 2958 square miles. Of the total population, 185,071 were males and 173,812 females; average density, 121\u00b73 per square mile; number of Hindus, 335,647; Muhammadans, 19,715; Sikhs, 51; Jains, 3362; Christians, 107; P\u00e1rsi, 1. Classified according to caste, there were 7239 Br\u00e1hmans and 1763 R\u00e1jputs; of other Hindu castes there were 330,007, including 120,310 Kunb\u00eds and 21,739 non-Hindu or aboriginal castes or tribes; the agricultural population numbered 227,308; the non-agricultural, 131,575; number of houses, 58,412. The Hatkars (Bargi Dhangars), who inhabit (speaking generally) the hills on the north bank of the Pengang\u00e1, are independent in bearing, and of fine physique, closely resembling each other\u2014a fact which may be accounted for by the constant and exclusive intermarriage of their three great\nfamilies. They do not allow the hair on the face to be cut. If a male Hatkar die of wounds received in battle or the chase, his corpse is burned with his feet to the east, otherwise he is buried sitting cross-legged with a small piece of gold in the mouth. Women who die in childbirth are burned, others are buried. Widows can contract a p\u00e1t marriage; a man can only have one lagan, but several p\u00e1t wives. Hatk\u00e1rs will not eat the flesh of the cow or the pig. Their god is called Khandoba. The Naiks of this District are principally Hatk\u00e1rs. Their power was broken by Brigadier Sutherland, under whose orders offenders failing to surrender themselves by a given date were hanged.\n\nThe principal towns are \u2014 B\u00e1sim, population (1881) 11,576; Um\u00e1rkhed, 5959; P\u00fasad, 5047; and Mangr\u00fal P\u00edr, 4900.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The staple crops are cotton and jo\u00e1r (great millet), neither of which requires much rain. The cotton is all banni, or the best and earliest kind. Considerable quantities of coarse rice are grown on unirrigated land, which has to be manured for the crop. Good land does not require a thorough ploughing more than once every seventh year, inferior land every third year. In the B\u00e1sim t\u00e1luk the autumn crops are estimated to cover $\\frac{9}{16}$ of the cultivated area\u2014the spring crops, $\\frac{7}{16}$; the estimate for the P\u00fasad t\u00e1luk is, for autumn, $\\frac{3}{4}$, and spring, $\\frac{1}{4}$. The country about Mangr\u00fal P\u00edr and Pus\u00e1d formerly supplied the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d Contingent with horses; but since Arab horses have been substituted, the stock has not been kept up, and at present there are not 100 horses in the District fit for troopers. The traffic of the District, chiefly cotton and grain, is carried on ordinary carts, pack-bullocks, buffaloes, and camels to the cotton emporiums on the railway. In 1880\u201381, 1,150,091 acres were under cultivation. The most important crops were jo\u00e1r, 385,691 acres; b\u00e1jr\u00e1, 3084; linseed, 17,642; tur, 27,042; pulses, 6187; kurdi, 12,071; cotton, 235,383; wheat, 179,254; gram, 41,774; til, 15,384; hemp or flax, 2295; castor-oil plant, 1862; sugar-cane, 1491; rice, 10,141; tobacco, 2711; lac, 25,355; and other products, 108,538. The average produce per acre in pounds is, for cotton, 108; for wheat, 634; oil-seeds, 169; jo\u00e1r, 478; tobacco, 198; rice, 488; and gram, 366. The uncertainty of reaching water at all, or of its being fit for use if reached, renders the construction of wells hazardous and costly. There are about 4000 wells in the District, of which nearly half are out of repair. Under Muhammadan rule, the revenue was generally farmed out, and all proprietary rights were vested in the sovereign, though no doubt minor prescriptive privileges were acknowledged. The Bombay system of survey and settlement has now been introduced into Ber\u00e1r. It confers absolute proprietary rights on the registered revenue-payer, on certain conditions; and the assessment is only subject to enhancement after the expiry of the agreed term, and not then unless upon\ngood reason shown. During the rule of the Peshw\u00e1, extravagant life-\ngrants were made to Br\u00e1hmans and Pandits, many of whom contrived\nto get them transmitted to heirs. Rent rates\u2014the average rate for\nland suited for cotton is 1s. per acre; for wheat land, 1s. 3d.; for jo\u00e1r,\n1s.; opium, 7s.; rice, 4s.; gram, 1s. 6d. The wage of skilled labour is\nfrom 1s. 6d to 2s. per day; of unskilled labour, 6d. Prices in 1880\u201381\nwere\u2014for clean cotton, 2\u00bd sers per rupee, or 2\u00bd lbs. for a shilling;\nwheat, 35 sers; gram, 36 sers; jo\u00e1r, 51 sers; common rice, 11 sers;\noil-seeds, 17 sers; and tobacco, 2\u00bd sers. A plough bullock costs \u00a34;\na sheep, 4s. The agricultural stock of the District in 1880\u201381 com-\nprised 280,098 cows and bullocks, 51,995 buffaloes, 195 horses, 7725\nponies, 1655 donkeys, 49,580 sheep and goats, 125 pigs, 140 camels,\n6262 carts, and 28,332 ploughs.\n\nManufactures and Trade.\u2014The chief manufactures of the District\nare coarse cotton cloth, blankets, and a little paper. The principal\nexports are cotton and wheat, which go to Bombay; gums, dyes, and\nforest produce are sent to Hingoli. There are four outposts in the\nDistrict at which trade registration is undertaken, viz. at R\u00e1jg\u00e1on,\nRisod, Mul\u00e1m\u00e1, and Um\u00e1rkhed; these outposts are maintained at an\nannual cost of \u00a3100. The value of imports registered in 1880\u201381,\nthrough these posts, amounted to \u00a3115,658; exports, to \u00a354,280.\nThe chief trading towns are B\u00e1sim and Um\u00e1rkhed; the principal\nfairs are held at Risod, Sirpur, Maleg\u00e1on, P\u00fasad, Um\u00e1rkhed, T\u00e1leg\u00e1on,\nand Negard\u00e1s. There are in the District 293 miles of made\nroad.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The total area assessed in 1881 was 1,263,034\nacres, of which 1,150,991 were under cultivation, 112,943 cultivable,\n180,628 grazing land, and 446,811 uncultivable waste. Sixty-three\nvillages held under the Waste Land Rules, with an area of 147,717\nacres, yield a revenue of \u00a3875.\n\nThe District is administered by a Deputy-Commissioner, with whom\nare associated assistants, European and Native. There are 3 revenue\nSub-divisions. Dak\u00e1iti and robbery have much decreased under\nBritish rule. There is one small receiving jail, from which persons are\ntransferred to the central jail at Akola; daily average of inmates,\n74\u00bd; expenditure per head of average strength, \u00a38, 17s. Of the\ntotal number of convicts, 67 were Hindus, 24 Muhammadans. The\nMuhammadans, who are only as 1 to 18 of the Hindu population, are\nas 1 to 4 of the convicts. The sanctioned strength of police in\n1880\u201381 was 67 officers and 324 men, giving an average of 1 policeman\nto every 7\u00bd square miles of area. There were in 1880\u201381, 86\nGovernment and aided schools, with 2814 pupils; and a central book\ndep\u00f4t, with two branches, one at P\u00fasad, the other at Mangr\u00fal. The\nonly municipality is B\u00e1sim town; population within municipal limits,\n11,576; receipts for 1880-81, \u00a3262; expenditure, \u00a3384; incidence of municipal taxation per head of population, 5\u00bdd.\n\nMeteorological Aspects.\u2014The climate of B\u00e1sim is preferred to that of the other Districts in Berar; the hot wind which blows during the day in the summer months is succeeded at night by a cool breeze. Highest shade temperature at B\u00e1sim in May, 104\u00b0 F.; lowest in December, 63\u00b0; rainfall for 1881, 37\u00b787 inches, which was 1\u00bd inches above the average\u2014over 32 inches fell from June to September. The principal diseases are fevers, bowel complaints, and cholera. The number of deaths registered in 1880 from all causes was 6464. Ratio of deaths per 1000 of population, 18\u00b70. The number of births registered in 1880 was 10,652; ratio per 1000 of population, 29\u00b77. Two Government dispensaries and one civil hospital afforded medical relief in 1880 to 9600 patients; 9355 persons were vaccinated by the vaccine department or at the civil dispensaries.

(Bombay, 1870); the Census Report for Ber\u00e1r for 1881; and the Administration Reports of the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d Assigned Districts for 1880 to 1882.]\n\nB\u00e1sim.\u2014T\u00e1luk of B\u00e1sim District, Ber\u00e1r. Area, 1051 square miles; contains 1 town and 321 villages. Population (1881) 157,690, namely, 81,565 males and 76,125 females, or 150\u00b703 persons per square mile. Hindus numbered 145,857; Muhammadans, 7891; Jains, 1830; Sikhs, 18; Christians, 93; Parsi, 1. Area occupied by cultivators, 543,943 acres.\n\nB\u00e1sim.\u2014Town in Ber\u00e1r, head-quarters of the District and t\u00e1luk of the same name. Lat. 20\u00b0 6\u2032 45\u2033 N., long. 77\u00b0 11\u2033 E.; height above sea level, 1758 feet; population (1881) within municipal limits, 11,576, namely, 6015 males and 5561 females. Of the total population, 8685 were returned as Hindus, 2485 as Musalm\u00e1ns, 317 as Jains, 79 as Christians, 9 Sikhs, and 1 P\u00e1rs\u00ed. Area of town site, 568 acres. The town is distant 52 miles south-south-east from Akola, on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, and 29 miles north from the military station of Hingoli; good metalled roads connect it with both these places. It is said to be a very old town, founded by Wachh, a Rishi, and originally named after him Wachh Gulin. A legend tells of a king, Was\u00faki, afflicted with leprosy, who was cured by bathing in a pool outside the town, which he enlarged to a tank, known as Padma T\u00edrtha, still largely resorted to for bathing in. It is said to petrify articles exposed to its action. The Desmukhs of B\u00e1sim, in the 17th century, received large grants of land and perquisites from the Mughal Emperor, and the family have always been of some consideration in South Ber\u00e1r. After the Bhonsla ruler at N\u00e1gpur ceased to receive a share (\u00bc) of the revenue, the Niz\u00e1m stationed\ntroops and established a mint at B\u00e1sim. The most striking buildings are the temple and tank of B\u00e1la\u00ed, constructed about 100 years ago by Bhaw\u00e1ni K\u00e1l\u00fa, a general of the Bhonslas. The town has a post-office, police station, and two good Government schools. Municipal revenue (1880-81) \u00a3262; expenditure, \u00a3384; incidence of municipal taxation, 5\u00bdd. per head of population.\n\n**B\u00e1sinakonda.** \u2014 A rock in the Madanapalli taluk, Cuddapah District, Madras Presidency; height, 660 feet above the town of Madanapalli, or 2800 feet above sea level. On the summit stands a pagoda to Vekatashasw\u00e1m\u00ed, who is supposed to have placed one foot here while travelling to the sacred pagoda at Tripatti, the other foot resting on Gandik\u00f3t.\n\n**Basi Tang** (or Taung).\u2014Mountain range in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bengal. Principal peak, Basi tang (21\u00b0 31' N. lat., and 92\u00b0 29' E. long.); height, 2181 feet. The hills are very steep, thickly covered with jungle, and uninhabited.\n\n**Baskh\u00e1ri.**\u2014Town in Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Oudh; 9 miles west of Birhar, and 50 miles south-east of Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d. Founded by a famous Muhammadan saint, named Makhdm Ashraf, about 1388 A.D., and still in the possession of his descendants. Population (1881) 2471, namely, Hindus 1808, and Muhammadans 663; 3 mosques and 3 Hindu temples; police station; Government school.\n\n**B\u00e1soda.**\u2014Native State in the Bhop\u00e1l Agency, under the agent to the Governor-General for Central India; originally a feudatory of Sindhia. In 1817 it was seized by Sindhia, but was restored by order of the British Government, and all connection with Gwalior has since ceased. It pays no tribute, and is now directly under the British Government. The capital of the State is in lat. 23\u00b0 50' 50\" N., and long. 77\u00b0 55' E. The chief bears the title of Naw\u00e1b, and is a Path\u00e1n by descent. Area, 22 square miles; population (1881) 7722, distributed in 19 villages, and occupying 1362 houses; density, 353 persons per square mile; revenue, \u00a31000. The military force consists of 3 guns, 8 artillerymen, 12 sow\u00e1rs, and 60 policemen.\n\n**Basohli.**\u2014Tract of country and town in Kashm\u00edr State, Punjab; situated on the R\u00e1vi river, at the foot of the southern Him\u00e1layan chain. The town, which lies in lat. 32\u00b0 33' N., and long. 75\u00b0 28' E., contains a large irregular b\u00e1z\u00e1r, and a handsome palace of the R\u00e1j\u00e1, moated and turreted like a medi\u00e6val castle. The R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Basohli were formerly independent, but were subjugated by the Sikhs in 1726 A.D.\n\n**Basorhi.**\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in B\u00e1ra Banki District, Oudh; bounded on the north by Dary\u00e1b\u00e1d, on the south by Mawai Mahol\u00e1ra, and on the west by the Kaly\u00e1ni river. Area, 34 square miles, of which 25 are cultivated, the principal crops being rice, wheat, and barley. Population (1881) 21,374.\nB\u00e1sr\u00e1.\u2014Village on the Bidy\u00e1dhar\u00ed river, in the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, Sundarbans, Bengal, and a station on the Calcutta and South-Eastern Railway; 20 miles from Calcutta, and 8 from Port Canning. Lat. 22\u00b0 22' N., long. 88\u00b0 37' E. Important d\u00e9p\u00f4t of the timber trade of the Sundarbans, and the scene of a weekly market (h\u00e1t), at which rice and stores of all kinds are sold. It was here that the celebrated fak\u00edr, Mub\u00e1rak Gh\u00e1zi, who overawed the wild beasts and rode through the jungles on a tiger, settled while the place was yet in the heart of the forest. In the Revenue Surveyor's report of the District, it is stated that 'altars to Mub\u00e1rak Gh\u00e1zi are common in every village in the vicinity of the jungles adjoining the Sundarbans, and wood-cutters never enter the jungle without invoking Mub\u00e1rak Gh\u00e1zi's protection against wild beasts. A number of fak\u00edrs, who call themselves descendants of Mub\u00e1rak Gh\u00e1zi, gain their livelihood by the offerings made on these altars by wood-cutters and boatmen. The custom is for the fak\u00edr to go to the spot where the wood is to be cut, and remain there three days without food, during which time Mub\u00e1rak Gh\u00e1zi appears to him in a dream, marking out the precincts within which wood can be cut, by lopping branches from the trees. Prayers and offerings are then made, and the wood-cutters warned not to go beyond the boundary marked out. When the boat is filled, offerings are again made, and one or two rupees are given to the fak\u00edr. It is strange enough that these wood-cutters are very seldom carried off by the tigers which everywhere infest the jungles; they go in without fear, the hatchet required to hew the timber being their only weapon and means of defence.'\n\nBasr\u00far (Abu-sar\u00far of Ibn Batuta, Bracelor, B\u00e1slor).\u2014Town in the K\u00fand\u00e1pur taluk, South K\u00e1nara District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 13\u00b0 40' N., long 75\u00b0 10' E.; population (1881) 1570; houses, 326. Now almost deserted, but once a large walled town with a fort and temple, and mentioned as an important trading place by all the Arabian geographers. The walls and water-gates still remain in good preservation. See Barkalur.\n\nBassein.\u2014Sub-division of Th\u00e1n\u00e1 District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 221 square miles, with 2 towns and 90 villages, and 10,934 occupied houses; population (1881) 68,967, namely, Hindus, 51,918; Muhammadans, 2292; 'others,' 14,757. This Sub-division, which lies in the west of the District, is formed of a portion of the mainland and territory which was once known as the island of Bassein, but is now no longer so, the narrow creek which divided the island from the mainland having silted up. The present Sub-division is 14 miles in breadth and about 17 in length, with the exception of two small hills, about 200 feet high, on the island portion; the surface here is flat, with a rich soil, yielding crops of rice, plantain, sugar-cane, and p\u00e1n. On the mainland portion are the Tung\u00e1r and K\u00e1man hills, both over 2000\nfeet in height, the last-named known as Bassein Peak or K\u00e1mandr\u00fag, being 2160 feet above sea level. On the coast the climate is generally pleasant and equable: inland the heat is great, and in the rains much fever prevails.\n\n**Bassein (Was\u00e1i).**\u2014Chief town of the Sub-division of Bassein in Th\u00e1n\u00e1 District, Bombay Presidency; about 5 miles from the Bassein Road Station on the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway, and 28 miles north of Bombay. Lat. $19^\\circ 20' 20''$ N., long. $72^\\circ 51' 20''$ E.; population (1882) 10,357, namely, Hindus, 6850; Muhammadans, 836; Jains, 5; Christians, 2623; Jains, 14; and 'others,' 29. Area of town site, 1926 acres. Municipal income (1880-81), \u00a3714; rate of taxation, 1s. 4\u00bdd. per head of the population within municipal limits; municipal expenditure in same year, \u00a3663. In 1880-81 the total value of the sea trade of Bassein, exclusive of Government stores, was \u00a3102,329, of which \u00a328,257 represented the value of imports, and \u00a374,072 that of exports. Sub-judge's court, post-office, and dispensary.\n\nBassein early attracted the notice of the Portuguese, as the river or strait separating the island from the mainland was a convenient rendezvous for shipping. In 1534, Bassein, with the land in its neighbourhood, was ceded to them by Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h, King of Guzer\u00e1t, and two years later the fort was built. For more than two centuries Bassein remained in the hands of the Portuguese, and during this time it rose to such prosperity that the city came to be called the Court of the North, and its nobles were proverbial for their wealth and magnificence. With plentiful supplies of both timber and stone, Bassein was adorned by many noble buildings, including a cathedral, 5 convents, 13 churches, and an asylum for orphans. The dwellings of the Hidalgos, or aristocracy, who alone were allowed to live within the city walls, are described (1675) as stately buildings, two storeys high, graced with covered balconies and large windows. Towards the end of the 17th century Bassein suffered severely from outbreaks of the plague, so deadly that in 1695 one-third of the population was swept away.\n\nNotwithstanding the decay of Portuguese power in the 17th century, Bassein, as late as 1720, would seem to have retained much of its prosperity. In that year, the population is returned at 60,499 souls, and the revenue a few years later (1729) at as much as \u00a345,706. (Xer. 914,125.) But the wealth of one city was unable to stay the advance of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 power. In 1739, Chimn\u00e1j\u00ed Ap\u00e1, a distinguished Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 general, at the head of a powerful army, appeared before Bassein. After a siege of three months, conducted on both sides with the greatest skill and courage, the garrison was forced to capitulate, and the town and District of Bassein passed into the hands of the Peshw\u00e1. Under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, Bassein became the chief place in their territories between the B\u00e1nkot river and Dam\u00e1n; but\nthey did not long keep possession of the city. In 1780, after a siege of twelve days, Bassein was captured by a British army, under the command of General Goddard. By the treaty of Salbai (1782) it was restored to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s; and in 1818, on the overthrow and deposition of the last of the Peshw\u00e1s, it was resumed by the English and incorporated with Th\u00e1n\u00e1 District of the Bombay Presidency.\n\nOf old Bassein, the walls and ramparts remain in a state of good preservation. Within the enclosure, the ruins of the cathedral of the Dominican convent, of the Jesuit Church of St. Paul, and of St. Anthony's Church, built as early as 1537, can still be identified.\u2014(See Dr. Da Cunha's Antiquities of Bassein. Bombay, 1876.)\n\nHere was concluded, in 1802, the treaty by which the Peshw\u00e1 agreed to maintain a British subsidiary force, thus virtually dissolving the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 confederacy.\n\n**Bassein.**\u2014District in Pegu Division, British Burma, lying between 15\u00b0 45' and 17\u00b0 45' N. lat., and between 94\u00b0 15' and 95\u00b0 28' E. long.; area, 7047 square miles; population in 1881, 389,419 souls. Bounded on the north by Henzada District lying east, and Sandoway west of the Arakan Hills; on the south and west by the Bay of Bengal; and on the east by Thongwa (Thun-Khwa) and a network of creeks. The head-quarters of the District are at Bassein town, situated on the river of the same name.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014Bassein District is in shape an irregular parallelogram, extending northwards from the Bay of Bengal, and divided into two very unequal parts by the Arakan hills. The western portion forms a narrow mountainous strip; the eastern is a stretch of alluvial land traversed by three large branches of the Irawadi (Irrawaddy), which flow nearly parallel to one another into the sea. Of this tract, the northern and largest portion as far south as Ngap\u00fataw is well watered and very fertile; the southern portion consists of cultivated plains and large wastes of forest, gradually merging into low marshy ground, cut up into numerous islands by the network of tidal creeks uniting the mouths of the Irawadi. The coast-line stretches from the mouth of the Gwa river in about lat. 17\u00b0 34' N., and long. 94\u00b0 37' E., for 110 miles in a south-westerly direction to Cape Negrais; thence it inclines south by east for 9 miles to Pagoda Point, the southern extremity of the Arakan Hills. In parts, the coast-line consists of a gently shelving sandy beach, backed by undulating forest land; beyond Cape Negrais, where the hills enter the sea abruptly, forming a bold and rugged escarpment, the coast is rocky. From Mawdin westwards, stretches a flat beach, bordered with grassy plains, which end in mangrove swamps, intersected in every direction by tidal inlets. The chief rivers are\u2014the Pyamalaw, with its two mouths, the Pyamalaw and the Pyinthal\u00fa; the Rwe, with the small Daye-bhy\u00fa mouth; and the Bassein, with the Thekkay-thaung\nmouth. The Pyamalaw leaves the Ky\u00fanpat at Shwe-laung, and flows for some distance north-west and west before it turns to the sea. The Rwe river is formed by the junction of several creeks. All these are almost entirely dependent upon the Irawadi and on the tide for their water supply. The Bassein river, though it leaves the Irawadi some miles above Henzada and is connected with it farther south by many streamlets, receives much of its water from the eastern slopes of the Arakan Hills, and is the only mouth used by large sea-going vessels ascending as far as Bassein town. The whole country south of 17\u00b0 N. lat., except to the west of the Arakan Yoma hills, and in their immediate neighbourhood on the east, consists of groups of islands formed by innumerable creeks and bifurcations, some of which are navigable by steamers, some only by canoes. The principal hills are the Arakan mountains, across which are several passes only practicable in dry weather. The most northern pass, which is entirely in this District, is the Bhawmi, from the junction of the Tsal\u00fa and Bhawmi streams to Thit-nan-k\u00fa on the Thien. The highest point is only 70 feet above the sea. Farther south there are two passes by the Chaung-tha and Sienma rivers; the crest of the first is 381, and of the second 284 feet above sea level.\n\nThe character and resources of the forests are not well known. There are large tracts of mangrove and evergreen forest. The chief timber trees are pyin-gado (Xylia dolabriformis), sha (Acacia catechu), taung pin (Artocarpus sp.), thitka (Quercus semiserrata). The quantity of teak found is small. A considerable area east of Ngap\u00fataw on the Bassein river, and a tract of country stretching northward from Bassein town, consist of laterite beds, covered to some depth by sandy deposits. A remarkable patch of calcareous sandstone occurs on the west coast of the District; the nummulitic or eocene group of rocks is well developed. In the south these have been termed the 'Negrais' beds. In some places, flaggy and massive sandstone abounds, in others, sections are exposed of highly altered shales and sandstones, and occasionally the sandstone is seen converted into a flinty rock. All these beds are internally silicified. These rocks have a peculiar greenish hue, which towards the north changes into a bluish tinge. Subordinate to the sandstone stratum an irregular bed of conglomerate occurs, but it forms a marked bed in one place only, viz. near Ywut-pa. It is here that the 'mud volcano' of the charts is situated; but it has no connection with volcanic action properly so called, and neither lava, ashes, nor volcanic rocks are seen about it. In appearance it is a low mound, and is now considered as the 'vent for a very feeble discharge of marsh gas.' In the southern portion of the Arakan range, limestone occurs in extensive masses. In some parts above this, there is an intensely hard ferruginous bed of conglomerate, characterized by\nnumerous quartz pebbles. Soapstone is found in the Arakan Hills, chiefly on their eastern slopes. Most of the lime used in the District is procured from a locality a few miles below Ngap\u00fataw on the Bassein river. The quantity is inexhaustible, the quality good, and access easy.\n\n**History.** \u2014 Little is known of the early history of the District. Ptolemy, in his sketch of the hydrography of India beyond the Ganges, says: \u2018From the range of M\u00e6andrus flow down all the rivers beyond Ganges, until you come to the river Besynga.\u2019 This Besynga has been identified with the Bassein branch of the Irawadi, and the Mons M\u00e6andrus with Yoma-daung, the range forming the backbone of Arakan. In old Talaing histories the \u201832 cities of Bassein\u2019 are mentioned in 625 A.D. as forming part of the kingdom of Pegu. About 1250 A.D. the Talaing princess, Um-madan-d\u00ed, ascended the throne; but a few years later Bassein was conquered by the Burmese. In 1289 A.D., according to Talaing history, Bassein again passed to Pegu. When Razadhirit, the greatest monarch of the Talaing dynasty, became king (1383 A.D.), Lauk-bya, Governor of Myaung-mya, proposed to assist the Burmese in conquering Pegu; and the acceptance of his offer led to incessant warfare between the two kingdoms. In 1686 the Governor of Madras determined to establish a settlement in Negrais, then considered a portion of Arakan; but the first expedition proved unsuccessful. In 1687, however, Negrais was taken possession of in the name of the East India Company, but no settlement was made there until 1753. At this time the war between the Burmese and Peguans, which ended in the complete subjugation of the latter, was at its climax. Both Burma and Pegu sought British aid, which was refused impartially; subsequently, it was urged that we should side with the Burmese, as the Talaings had succeeded in obtaining the assistance of our rivals the French, who then had a settlement at Syriam below Rangoon.\n\nThe King of Burma sent ambassadors to Negrais, who were escorted from Bassein by Captain Baker, then in charge of the British factory in that town. Soon after this (1775), a mission was despatched to the Burmese King, in order to obtain a formal grant of Negrais and the site of the Bassein factory, as it was considered that the whole country had passed to the Burmese monarchy. Unfortunately, about this time the British ships near Rangoon had been forced to aid the Talaings; and the Burmese King could not forgive this treachery, as he considered it. The English authorities insisted on absolute neutrality, but their local agents were in consequence suspected by both sovereigns. In 1757, a cession of Negrais and of ground at Bassein was obtained in perpetuity, as it was thought. In 1759, the Negrais establishment was withdrawn, and only a few persons were left in charge of the island and of the Company\u2019s property.\nCaptain Southey, their superintendent, landed on 5th October 1759; and on the 7th, when all the Europeans were assembled to meet the Burmese authorities, they were treacherously attacked and murdered, only one making his escape. In 1760, a mission was sent to obtain redress, but it was of no avail, and the Burmese King absolutely prohibited our return to Negrais.\n\nFrom this date until the first Burmese war, the British Government took no further steps towards forming a settlement in the District. During that war, Bassein town was captured and retained until the evacuation of Pegu, in accordance with the terms of the treaty of Yandab\u00fa. During the second Burmese war the town was again taken by our troops, and has remained in the possession of the British ever since. During the time of the annexation of Pegu, the whole of Bassein District was a prey to anarchy; the British troops were kept within the limits of the seaport towns and frontier stations, and in the interior numerous bandit chiefs set up independent authority, claiming to be officers of the Burmese King deputed to regain the country. A kind of civil war began; in one instance animosity was carried so far against the English, that the villages on the banks of the Irawadi which had supplied our steamers with fuel were destroyed. The great object of the British at this crisis was to rid the country of these gangs, to afford protection to its inhabitants, and restore their confidence in British rule. In January 1853, Captain Fytche, the Deputy Commissioner, succeeded in dispersing a force which had kept the whole country in the south and south-east in a state of terror. He first attacked a gang on Negrais island, and afterwards followed it up northwards into the Shwelaung township, destroying its three chief stations. Later a rebel band, under Mangyi Maung Nywung, the former governor of Bassein, was utterly routed, and its leader slain. By the beginning of March 1853, the lower tracts were freed from the large marauding parties which had hitherto occupied them, and only straggling bands of robbers remained.\n\nIn January 1854 fresh disturbances broke out. Two men named Shwe T\u00fa and Kyaw Zan Hla, aided by a Buddhist priest, assembled a number of desperate characters from the borders of the District, and succeeded in seizing the large towns of Dounggyi, Ngathaing-Chaung, and Regyi. The outbreak was speedily crushed by the rapid and decisive action of Major Fytche, who with a small military force of Europeans and 400 Native troops, aided by detachments under Major Baker and Lieutenant Shuldham, completely defeated the insurgents, whose leaders were either killed or captured. From this time there has been no serious endeavour to expel the British, and the District has enjoyed comparative rest.\n\nPopulation, etc.\u2014By the Census of 1872, but allowing for changes\nof area, the population was returned at 270,200 souls, and by that of 1881 at 389,419, showing an increase during nine years of 119,219. Classified according to religion, there were\u2014Hindus, 4851; Muhammadans, 4925; Christians, 21,324; Buddhists, 337,317; N\u00e1t or spirit worshippers, 20,967; Brahmos, 24; Jews, 7; and Pars\u00eds, 4. Total number of towns and villages, 1699, or an average of '18 to each square mile; number of occupied houses, 69,812, with an average of 5'57 inhabitants to each. Average density of the population, 55'26 per square mile. Classified according to race, there were\u2014Burmese, 275,544; Arakanese, 1909; Chins, 807; Karens, 96,008; Karenn\u00eds, 2; Toungthus, 12; Talaings, 3948; Sh\u00e1ns, 1225; Manip\u00faris, 31; Chinese, 744; Malays, 8; Bengalis and Hindust\u00e1n\u00eds, 6358; Uriy\u00e1s, 88; Persians, 9; Europeans, 845. Here, as elsewhere throughout the Province, except in Kyauk-py\u00fa and Tavoy, the males outnumber the females. In 1881 there were 202,949 of the former to 186,470 of the latter. This disproportion is caused by immigration from Madras, Chittagong, China, etc. The immigrants bring no wives with them, but marry Burmese women, whom they leave behind on their return to their own country. In former years, the Talaings mustered strongly; but the conquest by the Burmese King, Alaungpay\u00e1, and the cruelty exercised towards them by their rulers, whom they had irritated by siding with the English during the first Burmese war, drove many into exile, and more than decimated the number of those who could not escape. The Karengs in this District differ only from those living in the hills of Tenasserim by having adopted the Burmese mode of cultivation. The Shans are settlers from the north; many of the Muhammadans, and the majority of Hindus, are mere sojourners in quest of money to be spent in their own land. The Chins live chiefly in the hills to the north-west, the tribe stretching far away into Upper Burma and Arakan. (See ARAKAN HILL TRACTS.) The principal occupations of the inhabitants are agriculture, carried on in the large plains of the District, and fishing along the sea-coast and in the numerous ponds, rivers, and tidal creeks in the south.\n\nThe number of towns and villages in 1881 was 1699. The most important are\u2014BASSEIN, the head-quarters station, and one of the chief ports of the Province, on the Bassein river, 75 miles from the sea (population in 1881, 28,147); Lemyet-hna, lat. 17\u00b0 35' N., long. 95\u00b0 13' 30\" E., on the banks of the Bassein river (population in 1881, 5355); Myaung-mya, lat. 16\u00b0 35' N., and long. 95\u00b0 E., situated on the banks of the river of the same name (population in 1881, 2315); Ngap\u00fataw, lat. 16\u00b0 32' N., and long. 94\u00b0 46' E., on an island of the same name in the Bassein river, built on the side of a low range of hills (population in 1881, 928); and Regyi Pandaw, lat. 17\u00b0 19' 30\" N., and long. 15\u00b0 10' E., on a creek of the same name, composed of the once separate\ntowns of Yegyi and Pandaw, and the seat of an important rice trade (population in 1881, 2640),\u2014it was here that the Talaing army made its last stand before its complete defeat by Alaungpay\u00e1. Ngathaing-Khyoung, lat. 17\u00b0 22' 30\" N., and long. 95\u00b0 8' 30\" E., is on the Bassein river; its population in 1881 was 3557, chiefly engaged in an extensive rice trade with Bassein; for some years it was garrisoned by a detachment of Native Infantry from Bassein, but is now guarded by a police force. Kyunpyaw, lat. 17\u00b0 17' N., long. 95\u00b0 16' E., on the Daga river at the southern entrance of the Yegyi creek; had a population in 1881 of 895, employed in agriculture, trading, and fishing. The 1699 towns and villages in 1881 are thus classified\u20141061 with less than two hundred inhabitants; 560 with from two to five hundred; 64 with from five hundred to a thousand; 9 with from one thousand to two thousand; 2 from two to three thousand; 1 with from three to five thousand; and 1 with over twenty thousand inhabitants.\n\nAgriculture, etc.\u2014In 1855-56, the area under cultivation was 134,520 acres; in 1864-65 this had risen to 186,129, in 1874-75 to 305,902, and in 1881 to 393,400 acres. The area under different crops in 1880 was as follows:\u2014Rice, 369,952 acres; oil-seeds, 5; sugar, 170; cotton, 49; betel leaf, 373; vegetables, fruit-trees, etc., 9433 acres. The staple product is rice, and the average out-turn reaches 142 cwts. per acre. In 1881-82, the gross produce was 295,393 tons. Sesamum and tobacco are cultivated to a small extent. The yield of cotton averages 83 lbs. per acre. The agricultural stock, notwithstanding the transfer of two large townships, has increased largely of late years. In 1869-70, the number of cows, bulls, and bullocks was 33,746; of buffaloes, 78,108; sheep and goats, 1281; pigs, 23,464; carts, 14,974; ploughs, 23,253. By 1882, the number of cows, bulls, and bullocks had increased to 77,415; of buffaloes, to 63,629; of sheep and goats, to 1995; of pigs, to 29,265; of carts, to 22,797; ploughs, 29,894. The number of boats has decreased from 12,623 to 10,710. Rates of rent for the different descriptions of land, suited to the various crops, were returned as follows in 1880-81:\u2014Rice, 3s. 4d. an acre; oil-seeds, 3s. 1\u00bdd.; sugar-cane, 4s.; cotton, 3s. 1\u00bdd.; cocoa-nuts, 1s. 6d.; dhani, 2s. 9d.; taungya, or hill cultivations, 1s. 7\u00bed.; mixed fruits, 4s. 7\u00bdd.; vegetables, 4s. 6d.; and plantains, 3s. 6d. an acre. The average size of a holding is about 15 acres\u2014a larger area than is held farther north. Hired labourers are rarely employed; their wages vary from about 16s. with board to \u00a31 without board. As a rule, proprietors cultivate their own land, and renting is not common. The produce of the District can easily be transported by the tidal creeks, the natural means of communication, which also irrigate and fertilize the country. Annually, on the rise of the Irawadi, large tracts of country are flooded, and the crops are often destroyed. In order to protect the rice land\nsmall embankments were formerly raised by the inhabitants, but these were too slight and too much localized to be of any permanent benefit. Since 1865, large embankments have been, and still are being, made by the State along the banks of the Irawadi, and one along the left bank of the Bassein from its northern mouth is complete beyond Ngathaing-Chaung.\n\nManufactures, etc.\u2014The principal manufactures of the District are salt, ngapi or salt-fish, and pottery\u2014the first two mainly on the sea-coast in the Ngap\u00fataw and Myaung-mya townships, and the last in the Bassein, Myaung-mya, and Yegyi townships. Several saline plains occur within a distance of 8 or 10 miles from the sea-coast, and in the alluvial delta; and wherever these are in the vicinity of creeks, salt is prepared by means of solar evaporation and boiling. The pots in which it is boiled contain about $4\\frac{1}{2}$ gallons of brine each, and at every evaporation yield about 7 lbs. of salt. The salt manufacture is carried on for about four months, and the average produce of one pot during the season is 1350 lbs. The salt is sold on the spot for the preparation of salt fish and ngapi. The expenditure during a season for a boiling place of 200 pots is about \u00a3188, and the value of the salt made, \u00a3250\u2014net profit, \u00a362. Several kinds of ngapi are manufactured, of which dameng is the most important. It is made on the sea-coast, and consists of a mixture of all kinds of fish and prawns, which, as they are caught in the traps, are thrown en masse on to a raised platform made of bamboo, and left there for about eight hours for the water to drain off. By this time decomposition has generally set in; the whole mass is then thickly sprinkled with salt, and crushed and mixed together by hand, when it is ready for market. About 4700 lbs. of salt are required for 100 baskets of ngapi. Large pots and other kinds of heavy glazed pottery are made at Thit-nyog\u00fan, near Bassein town. In a single season\u2014i.e. from January to April\u2014two men can turn out 1000 pots of sizes, generally sold to traders on the spot at prices varying from \u00a312 to \u00a313.\n\nCommerce.\u2014The trade of Bassein District has enormously increased since the British occupation, as the following figures (repeated in more detail in the article on Bassein Town) show:\u2014Total value of exports from Bassein harbour in 1855\u201356, \u00a352,543; imports, \u00a324,300; tonnage of vessels cleared, 2847 tons. In 1865\u201366\u2014value of exports, \u00a3289,965; imports, \u00a332,876; tonnage, 42,163. In 1876\u201377\u2014value of exports, \u00a3503,468; imports, \u00a344,764; tonnage, 81,297 tons. In 1880\u201381, the exports amounted to \u00a31,010,574, and the imports to \u00a371,635, in value, exclusive of treasure. Communication is carried on almost entirely by water, and the country requires few roads. In the dry season cart tracks lead from village to village, and during the rains a boat can pass almost everywhere. Total length of inland water com-\nmunication, 387 miles. The postal communications are\u2014(1) a monthly service by the British India Steam Navigation Company between Chittagong and Penang, the steamers calling at Akyab, Kyauk-py\u00fa, Sandoway, Bassein, etc.; (2) a service twice a week by the steamers of the Irawadi Flotilla Company between Rangoon and Bassein; (3) a service, maintained out of the District d\u0101k portion of the Five-per-cent. Cess Fund, three times a month between Bassein and Ngathaing-Khyaung. There is one newspaper published in the District, at the Bassein town press.\n\nRevenue, etc.\u2014The actual revenue of the District prior to its annexation cannot be accurately ascertained. From local records found in the various offices, it appears that the annual revenue furnished by Bassein, as it existed in Burmese times, was\u2014(1) house and family tax (Burmese and Kareng), \u00a312,273; (2) yoke of oxen, or rice land tax, \u00a33598; (3) fisheries, \u00a39203; (4) salt, \u00a31338; (5) transit dues, \u00a31838: total, \u00a328,250. Adding two-thirds for the share of the local officers, the amount paid by the inhabitants was at least \u00a347,080. In 1855\u201356, the first year in which the revenue returns can be depended upon, the amount realized was \u00a361,791. This was derived from taxes on land, fisheries, salt, forest produce, port dues, excise, capitation fees, etc. In 1855\u201356, the area under cultivation (exclusive of taungya, or hill clearings) was 134,520 acres, the land revenue being \u00a321,222, and the rate of taxation 3s. 1\u00bdd. per acre. In 1875\u201376, the number of acres under tillage rose to 264,320, the income from land to \u00a343,732, and the average rent per acre to 3s. 3d. By 1880\u201381, the total land revenue had increased to \u00a377,861, and the cultivated area to 393,400 acres; average incidence, 3s. 1\u00bdd. per acre. Under the Burmese, the total demand for the capitation tax was ordered annually by the governor of the District, the assessment per circle being left to the Akhwon-w\u00fan, and the assessment per house to the discretion of the Th\u00fa-gyi. Under English rule each married man pays 10s., and each bachelor between eighteen and sixty (except priests, cripples, etc.), 5s. In 1855\u201356, the yield of this tax was \u00a319,465; in 1876\u201377, \u00a330,530; and in 1881\u201382, \u00a334,887. In 1876\u201377, the amount realized by the fishery tax was \u00a310,898, and in 1881\u201382, \u00a317,220. The proceeds of the salt tax are decreasing yearly owing to the importation of cheaper foreign salt. In 1855, the price per maund of 80 lbs. was 13 annas, or 2s. 3d. per cwt.; in 1881\u201382 it was 10\u00bd annas, or 1s. 10d. per cwt. The excise revenue yielded in 1855\u201356, \u00a35539; in 1876\u201377, \u00a312,789; and in 1881\u201382, \u00a331,224. The gross Imperial and Provincial revenue in 1881\u201382 was \u00a3261,719, as compared with \u00a3166,646 in 1876\u201377, and \u00a3107,189 in 1867\u201368. The expenditure in 1881\u201382 was \u00a339,214, as compared with \u00a319,673 in 1876\u201377, and \u00a313,926 in 1867\u201368. The Local revenue raised in the District in 1876\u201377 over and above the Imperial and Provincial\nrevenue, excluding the port and dispensary funds and the municipal revenue of Bassein town, was \u00a36005.\n\nAdministration.\u2014On the annexation of Pegu, Bassein District was formed out of the Bassein governorship of Burmese times, but there was added to it a seaboard strip of country, a portion of Sandoway, which extended west of the Arakan Hills to about lat. 18\u00b0 N. The northern part of this tract was afterwards reunited to Sandoway. In 1875, the Shwe-loung and Pantanaw townships, in the extreme east of the District, were taken away. Up to 1853, the country was in a very disturbed state, and the civil officers, aided occasionally by a few troops from the Bassein garrison, were continually engaged in dispersing large gangs of armed marauders. The Deputy-Commissioner was in consequence empowered to punish with death all persons convicted of complicity in rebellion, and a police force was raised of a total strength of 546 men. In 1861, the police battalion was disbanded; and a regular force for the whole Province, under an inspector-general and District superintendents, was organized. In 1876, the regular police force in Bassein numbered 331 of all ranks, besides a municipal or town police of 114 officers and men, maintained at a total cost of \u00a310,741, of which \u00a38579 was payable from imperial revenues, and \u00a32162 from municipal or local funds. Bassein District is divided into 8 townships, and these again into revenue circles\u2014Yegy\u00ed, 12; Sam-bey-r\u00fan, 8; Thabaung, 14; Bassein, 8, including Bassein town; Ngap\u00fataw, 11; Th\u00ed-kwin, 10; Myaung-mya, 9. The administrative staff consists of a Deputy-Commissioner, Assistant-Commissioners, and subordinates. About 1855, the head-quarters of the District were transferred from Bassein to Dalhousie, so called in honour of the Governor-General to whom was due the annexation of Pegu. Situated near the mouth of the Bassein river, and admirably adapted as a port of call, being placed at the natural outlet of a vast tract of fertile country, it was hoped that Dalhousie would become an important town. In 1856\u201357, however, the whole site was submerged by a sudden rise of the sea consequent on a cyclone, and in the same year the head-quarters were re-transferred to Bassein, the present station. The new District jail was completed in 1868 at a cost of \u00a317,260; there is accommodation for 405 male and 16 female prisoners. In 1855, the daily average number of prisoners of all classes was 317. The average in 1880\u201381 was: convicted prisoners, 383 males, 7 females\u2014total, 390; under trial, 8; debtors, excise prisoners, and revenue defaulters, 8: total of all classes, 406. In 1860, a Kareng normal and industrial school was opened by the American Baptist missionaries, at which, in 1881, the average daily attendance of boys and girls was 193. The Baptist Mission have also established village schools, a normal school at Bassein, a school for Burmese, etc., all of which are\naided by the State. The Roman Catholic community have also established a good school in Bassein town, as well as a girls' school, with an average attendance of 84 pupils. In 1874, Government established a middle-class school. The number of pupils on March 31, 1881, was 192. At the cess school in Ngathaing-Chaung the fees are 1s. per month for boys, and 6d. for girls. Primary education is in the hands of Buddhist monks, and the schools of those monks who will allow it, are examined yearly. The total number of inspected schools in 1880-81 was 368, of which 2 were Government, 4 Mission schools, and 368 indigenous village schools. Total number of pupils, 8630. This is exclusive of uninspected schools, for which no details are available. The Census Report of 1881, however, returned 17,642 boys and 1833 girls as under instruction in that year, besides 81,097 males and 3292 females able to read and write, but not under instruction; proportion of educated males, 48\u00b765 per cent. of the male population; ditto of females, 2\u00b775 per cent. of the female population.\n\nClimate, etc.\u2014The climate of Bassein is relaxing, owing to the situation of the District in the delta of the Irawadi, with the country around intersected by tidal creeks, the muddy banks of which are exposed during the greater part of the day. In 1881-82, the total rainfall was 112\u00b720 inches. Cholera and fever are reported to be endemic, whilst bowel complaints, dropsy, and rheumatism are common. Small-pox is much spread by inoculation. [For further information regarding Bassein, see the article in the British Burma Gazetteer (Rangoon, 1879), vol. ii. pp. 84-112; the British Burma Census Report of 1881; and the Provincial Administration Reports from 1880 to 1883.]\n\nBassein.\u2014Township on the left bank of the Bassein river, in Bassein District, Pegu Division, British Burma. Towards the north the ground is undulating, but the country to the south is flat, and highly cultivated with rice. The town of Bassein lies in the west centre. In 1881 the population numbered 48,367; the gross revenue was \u00a311,983.\n\nBassein.\u2014Town, head-quarters station, and chief port of Bassein District, British Burma; situated in the delta of the Irawadi, on both banks of the Bassein river. Lat. 16\u00b0 46' N., long. 94\u00b0 48' 10\" E. Population in 1876, 22,417. In 1881 it had risen to 28,147, consisting of 19,848 Buddhists, 3781 Hindus, 3362 Muhammadans, 1122 Christians, and 34 'others.' Municipal revenue in 1881-82, \u00a31285; expenditure, \u00a31207. On the left bank of the river, in the Ze-Chaung quarter, is the Shwe Mu-htaw Pagoda. This now forms the centre of the English fort, in which are also the court-houses, treasury, and police office. The other quarters of the town on the left bank are Athegyi, Myothit, and Talaing-Chaung. The small Theng-bhaw-gyeng suburb, containing the rice mills and store yards of the principal merchants,\nstands on the right bank. To the east of Myothit stretches a plain covered with pagodas, monasteries, and colossal images in every stage of decay, where the feasts and religious assemblies of the inhabitants are held.\n\nThe Trade of the port has rapidly progressed under British rule. During the years immediately preceding the annexation of Pegu, a few small vessels visited Bassein, taking away cutch, stick lac, lead, and timber, to foreign and Indian ports. The export of rice was prohibited by the native Government; but the Burmese Collector of Customs, who owned a few vessels, contrived to export small quantities to the Straits, receiving in return beche de mer and other produce. In 1853-54, the value of the imports into Bassein was returned at \u00a320,892, and the exports at \u00a36922; total, \u00a327,814. Five years later, in 1858-59, the imports amounted to \u00a336,378, and the exports to \u00a3152,783; total, \u00a3189,161. Up till 1860, the imports consisted mainly of betel-nuts, gunny-bags, and tobacco from inter-provincial ports; and also gunny-bags, cotton piece-goods, and tobacco, almost entirely from Indian ports. The first cargo of rice for foreign ports was made in April 1854, when a ship-load was despatched to the United States. This trade rapidly increased, and the port steadily advanced in prosperity. Between 1862-63 and 1881-82 the imports increased from \u00a316,480 to \u00a379,137 in value; and the exports from \u00a3102,108 to \u00a3958,560. The total value of the trade increased from \u00a3118,588 in 1862-63 to \u00a31,037,697 in 1881-82, or by nine-fold. In the earlier years of British administration, the imports consisted chiefly of betel-nuts, gunny-bags, raw tobacco, and cotton piece-goods. To these have since been added salt, coal, machinery, hardware, provisions, wines, etc. The inter-provincial sea-borne trade has almost entirely disappeared, owing to greater facilities of communication afforded by numerous creeks between Rangoon and Bassein. In 1861-62, the value of the inter-provincial sea-borne trade was \u00a324,178; in 1881-82 it had fallen to \u00a34062. The character of the export trade is also changed, and is now almost entirely confined to the export of rice and a little timber. In 1881-82, out of a total export trade valued at \u00a3958,560, no less than \u00a3956,348 represented the value of the rice exports. In 1880-81, the total value of exports was \u00a31,010,574, of which rice represented \u00a31,007,826; total value of imports, exclusive of treasure, \u00a371,635; tonnage of vessels cleared, 100,056. The following description of the busy scene in the harbour is taken from the Blue Book on the Trade of British India, 1872-73 to 1876-77 (published in 1878):\n\n'The rice season here resembles in its aspects the rice season elsewhere in Burma\u2014creeks crowded with boats laden with paddy, mills at work from morning to night, the surface of the river and creeks covered inches thick with paddy husks, and shipping busily taking in\nthe cleaned rice from the mills. These rice mills are a feature in the ports of Burma. There is nothing like them in continental India (except at Port Canning, and there the mills are a failure), where the rice is husked in the interior of the Districts by the family of the cultivator before it is sent to the market for disposal. In Burma, the cultivator is too well-to-do to care about undertaking the trouble of husking the rice, and he leaves that to be done by the European purchaser at the port of shipment. The mills are worked by powerful machinery moved by steam; and the coal which is required by them forms the main article of import from foreign countries into Akyab and Bassein, the latter port importing also a certain quantity of salt. Bassein is supplied with all her other imports from Rangoon in river steamers, which ply twice a week through the narrow tidal creeks, lined with mangrove jungle, which form the Burmese Sundarbans between Rangoon and Bassein. These steamers belong to the Irawadi Flotilla Company, and are specially constructed for the service. Light as they are in draught, in the dry weather they often stick fast in the mud for hours together. The steamers do a very large trade in the carriage of passengers and cargo between Rangoon and Bassein, but no record of the actual value of the trade has as yet been attempted.\n\nWithin the last few years telegraphic communication has been established between Bassein and Rangoon, and it is proposed to extend the line to the mouth of the river, where ships call for orders. In 1881-82, the municipal revenue of the town was \u00a312,859. Bassein was utterly depopulated in the time of Alaungpay\u00e1 (Alompra), and no trustworthy records of its early history exist. It is said to have been founded in 1249 A.D. by Umtmadani, a Talaing princess. From the natural advantages of its site, it has always been a harbour of considerable importance, and is alluded to as 'Cosmin' by Ralph Fitch and other travellers, who found Rangoon a small village. 'Cosmin' is a corruption of Kusimanagara. The place was an important seaport as early as the 12th century. During the first Burmese war, the occupation of the town by the British was unopposed, the Burmese governor having set fire to it and retreated to Le-myet-hna. The population gradually returned, and the place was not abandoned till the conclusion of war, when the troops were withdrawn. During the second Burmese war, Bassein was finally taken by assault. The town has a charitable dispensary and two hospitals, one for Europeans and one for natives. A new hospital was built a few years ago. The total number of patients treated in 1876 was 3461, of whom 264, including 10 Europeans, were in-patients.\n\n**Bassein.** \u2014 River in Irawadi Division, British Burma; the most westerly of the main channels by which the Irawadi reaches the sea. Its northern entrance, about 9 miles above Henzada town, is in the dry\nseason completely closed by a sand-bar; but steamers ply between Bassein and Henzada all the year round, entering the Bassein river by the Thambayadaing, which leaves the Irawadi some 12 miles above Henzada, and joins the Bassein near Chaukywa. Flowing south-west, the Daga leaves it 3 miles from the main stream of the Irawadi, to rejoin it again a few miles farther on. After their reunion, the Panmawadi and other large tidal creeks connect the Bassein by innumerable smaller channels with the other mouths of the Irawadi, and after a tortuous course of 200 miles, it falls into the Bay of Bengal at Pagoda Point. The banks of the river are for the most part low, muddy, and covered with jungle; in some portions of its course the country is hilly, and the river is studded with rocks and islands. Haing-gyi, or Negrais Island, lies at its mouth. Two channels, one on each side of it, lead into the river; the western forms a good harbour, the eastern is rendered dangerous by a reef of rocks projecting from P\u00farian nearly to Diamond Island, facing the mouth of the river; 75 miles up the river is Bassein Town, the head-quarters of the District of the same name.\n\n**Bastar.**\u2014Feudatory State attached to Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 District, Central Provinces, lying between 17\u00b0 46' and 20\u00b0 37' N. lat., and 80\u00b0 18' and 82\u00b0 21' E. long. Bounded on the north by R\u00e1ipur District; on the south by the Sironch\u00e1 Sub-division of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 District; on the east by the Bendr\u00e1 Naw\u00e1g\u00e1rh estate in R\u00e1ipur, and the J\u00e1ipur State; and on the west partly by the Ahf\u00edri estate, and partly by Sironch\u00e1 Sub-division. Population (1881) 196,248 souls; area, 13,062 square miles. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 resides at Jagdalpur, which is also the principal town.\n\nThe extreme length of Bastar is about 170 miles, its breadth about 120 miles. In the centre and north-west, the country is very mountainous; on the east extends a table-land nearly 2000 feet above sea level, yielding rich crops wherever it is cultivated; while ranges of sandstone hills diversify the south. These ranges all run north-west and south-east. As each ends, generally in a steep declivity, another begins from 5 to 15 miles to the south, and runs in a parallel direction, till in like manner a third line succeeds. Few springs rise in these hills; great boulders of vitrified sandstone strew their surface, and glitter in the sun with a pinkish hue. Another range, known as the Bel\u00e1 Dil\u00e1 ('Bullock's Hump'), from a particular elevation near Dantiw\u00e1r\u00e1 resembling a bullock's hump, crosses the centre of the dependency, increasing in height as it runs due southward, till it culminates in two lofty peaks, called Nandir\u00e1j and Pitur R\u00e1n\u00ed, between 3000 and 4000 feet above sea level, and forming a portion of the Eastern Gh\u00e1ts. The soil through the greater part of Bastar consists of a light clay with an admixture of sand, well adapted to the raising of rice, but requiring a good supply of water. The Indrav\u00e1t\u00ed, the Sab\u00e1r\u00ed, and the T\u00e1l or T\u00e1lper, the only important rivers, all fall into\nthe God\u00e1vari. Iron ore of good quality is reported to abound, but it is little worked, as the demand is insignificant.\n\nThe Census of 1881 returned the total population of Bastar State at 196,248, spread over an area of 13,062 square miles, and inhabiting 2204 villages, and 38,271 houses; average density of population, 15 per square mile; villages per square mile, 17; houses per square mile, 2.93; persons per house, 5.13. Classified according to sex, there were\u2014males, 103,046, and females, 93,202. According to religion, there were\u2014Hindus, 159,123; Muhammadans, 779; Kabirpanthis, 3; Sikhs, 2; and aboriginal tribes still following their primitive faiths, 36,341. The most numerous of the aboriginal tribes is the Gonds, locally known as M\u00e1ri\u00e1s and Bhathr\u00e1s, and a scattering of Bhils. Among the Hindus, the Br\u00e1hmans are few in number; the mass of the Hindu population consisting of Dhers or Mhars, Mal\u00eds or Mar\u00e1\u00eds, Kunb\u00eds, Ah\u00edrs or Gaulis, and Kallars, and other cultivating or inferior castes. The numbers for each caste and tribe are not given separately in the Census Report. The Br\u00e1hmans for the most part dwell in and around Jagdalpur. They all eat fish and goat\u2019s flesh, and will drink water from the hands of the G\u00e1hiras, or cowherds. A caste known as Dh\u00e1kars are the illegitimate offspring of Br\u00e1hmans, and wear the sacred thread. A practice formerly existed in Bastar and the neighbouring State of Jaipur of bestowing the sacred thread as a reward for good service, or of selling it to persons of certain castes. The Halb\u00e1s or Halw\u00e1s, a cultivating clan of the Gond tribe, who also wear the sacred thread, occupy the more level and cultivated tracts, principally in the northern part of the State. The Gadw\u00e1s or Gadb\u00e1s, corresponding to the Kols of R\u00e1jmahal, who are found towards the east, subsist by cultivation and by labour. A Gadw\u00e1 woman dresses in a singular fashion; taking a cloth, 3 feet by 6, made from the bark of the karing tree, with broad horizontal bands of red, yellow, and blue, she passes it round her waist, brings it across the shoulder, and then fastens it down before the bosom. Next she secures this cloth with a girdle composed of not less than 40 separate cords about 20 inches long, with the ends bound together and worn in front. She crowns her hair with a chaplet of the large white seeds of the kusa grass, often twisted with strings of beads; large earrings of brass wire hang from the upper cartilage of each ear down to the shoulder, while an earring resembling a brass button decorates the lobe of the ear. On festivals, both men and women dance to a fife and drum, and sometimes a man and a woman will step out of the crowd and sing alternately impromptu verses of uncouth raillery. It is in Bastar that the Gonds may be studied to most advantage. A detailed account of them will be found under the headings Central Provinces and Gonds. The principal of the Gond clans, other than those enumerated above, are\nthe Mari\u00e1s and Mar\u00eds, uncivilised and timid people inhabiting the deepest recesses of the jungle. A description of them and of the other Gond clans will be found under their respective alphabetical headings.\n\nThroughout the State, Dantesw\u00e1ri or M\u00e1uli (who is identified with Bhaw\u00e1n\u00ed or K\u00e1l\u00ed), and M\u00e1t\u00e1 Dev\u00ed, are objects of universal worship. The higher castes also adore the well-known deities of the Hindu Pantheon. Dantesw\u00e1ri, however, must be regarded as the tutelary divinity of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s, and generally of the Bastar dependency. It was under her guardianship that the reigning family left Hindust\u00e1n and dwelt at Warangul; and when the Muhammadans drove them out of the kingdom of Teling\u00e1n\u00e1, it was she who directed and accompanied their flight as far as Dantiw\u00e1r\u00e1, where she took up her abode. Her temple stands at the confluence of the Sankh\u00e1ni and Dank\u00e1ni rivers, and within the temple enclosure the hereditary Puj\u00e1ri, or priest, has his residence. Here there is reason to believe that human sacrifices (meriah) were once practised; and for many years after 1842, a guard was placed over the temple, and the R\u00e1j\u00e1 held personally responsible. At present most travellers offer a goat to the goddess when they pass her shrine. Some, too, consult her by placing flowers upon the head of her image. As the flowers fall to the right or the left, so her response is deemed favourable or the reverse. The idol is of black stone, generally dressed in a white muslin sari, and wearing ordinary female ornaments.\n\nJagdalpur, the capital, and residence of the R\u00e1j\u00e1, is the only town containing upwards of 1000 inhabitants (population 4294), and but 17 other places have a population exceeding 500; 170 villages contain from 200 to 500 inhabitants, and 2016 have fewer than 200.\n\nOf the total area of 13,062 square miles, only 1000 are cultivated; of the portion lying waste, two-thirds are returned as cultivable. North of the Indr\u00e1vat\u00ed river, the soil is the property of the State; and the land to the south of the river is nearly all composed of zamind\u00e1ris or estates of petty chiefs, who hold their lands under a service tenure subject to a light tribute to the R\u00e1j\u00e1, but liable to periodical enhancement. The largest of these zamind\u00e1ris are Bhupalpatnam (1170 square miles), Kutia (1072 square miles), and Biji (855 square miles). Rice constitutes the most important crop in Bastar; but oil-seeds, dyes, ral, dammar, kosa, lac, galls, and fibres are also produced. No cotton, and but a very small quantity of wheat and gram, are grown. Sugar-cane, of a superior quality, constitutes an important crop, and gur or crude sugar is exported to the sea-coast, and to N\u00e1gpur. One of the most important productions of Bastar consists of its horns and hides. The gur, wax, and honey must also be mentioned.\n\nThe State is almost destitute of manufactures. The weavers make a coarse kind of cloth; and a caste called Gh\u00e1s\u00edas carry on a business in Jagdalpur town, by working up brass pots out of the fragments of\nold ones. Brass utensils are largely imported from N\u00e1gpur and R\u00e1ipur. All petty sales are effected by barter, or by kaur\u00eds or shells when procurable, 20 kaur\u00eds (cowries) making a bor\u00ed, 12 bor\u00eds a d\u00edg\u00e1n\u00ed, and 12 d\u00edg\u00e1n\u00eds one rupee. The general system is for the R\u00e1j\u00e1 to keep up granaries and storehouses, often receiving grain in part payment of the land tax, and retailing it with the other necessaries of life to his own establishments and travellers. Iron ore of good quality abounds on the Bel\u00e1 D\u00edl\u00e1, and in the valley of the river Jor\u00edv\u00e1g, but in consequence of the small demand is hardly ever worked. Salt, piece-goods, spices, and opium are imported from the coast by way of Jaipur, Sunkam, and Kaller; grain, wheat, and paper from R\u00e1ipur; and in the western parts, cloth, tobacco, and opium from the Niz\u00e1m's Dominions. But though the situation of the State is favourable for traffic, and the configuration of the country and the nature of the soil would facilitate the construction of highways, not a single made road exists in Bastar. The Bary\u00e1ra line from the south of R\u00e1ipur is expected to assume considerable importance, passing as it does through a portion of Bastar, and thence through the Ah\u00edr\u00ed zam\u00ednd\u00e1r\u00eds and the Sironch\u00e1 t\u00e1luk to a point where it branches into two lines, running respectively to the large stations on the south-east coast and to Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d. By this route, wheat is already exported in large quantities from Chhattisgarh. The State has no navigable river.\n\nThe estimated gross revenue of Bastar amounted, in 1881, to \u00a39213, and the tribute to \u00a3305. Transit duties are imposed on goods entering or passing through the State, but arrangements are now (1882) being made with a view to their total abolition. The R\u00e1j\u00e1's military force consisted of 4 gunners, 12 horsemen, 50 sepoys, and 400 retainers armed with swords, and 3 small cannon. R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bh\u00e1iram Deo claims to be a R\u00e1jput. The family follow primogeniture, but have no sanad authorizing adoption. In 1882, the R\u00e1j\u00e1's heir was his nephew. Education is at a low standard in the State.\n\nThe chief cause of mortality in Bastar is fever, which prevails especially from September to November, commonly accompanied with dysentery and diarrhoea. At rare intervals cholera appears, but seldom extends beyond the larger villages on the more frequented routes. On the other hand, small-pox is common, and the dread it inspires appears from the numerous temples dedicated to M\u00e1t\u00e1 Dev\u00ed. The patient, into whose body the goddess is deemed to have entered, is treated with scrupulous regard. As soon as the disease shows itself, his feet are washed with cow's milk, and carefully wiped upon the head of his nearest relative; M\u00e1t\u00e1 Dev\u00ed is then prayed to take under her special protection the family whom she has honoured with a visit; the patient is placed upon a bed of fresh rice-straw, with a screen around him; his\nfriends constantly repair to the temple of M\u00e1t\u00e1 Dev\u00ed, and anoint her image with ground sandal-wood and water, with which they then sprinkle the house where the patient lies, and sign his forehead; his diet consists of fruit and cooling food and drink, but no medicines are administered. Vaccination is unknown; inoculation, however, is practised to some extent. Rheumatism affects many of the inhabitants, and hydrocele is exceedingly common.\n\n**Basti.**\u2014District of the Benares Division, in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, lying between $26^\\circ 24' 45''$ and $27^\\circ 30' N.$ lat., and between $82^\\circ 17'$ and $83^\\circ 15'$ E. long.; area, 2752 square miles; population (1881) 1,630,612 souls, or 592 to the square mile.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014Basti is a sub-montane tract lying between the Nep\u00e1l Hills and the Gogra (Gh\u00e1gra) river, and presents the flat, marshy aspect typical of tar\u00e1i land. The territory of Nep\u00e1l bounds it on the north; Gorakhpur District of the North-Western Provinces on the east; and the Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d and Gonda Districts of Oudh on the south and west. It has a mean height of only 326 feet above sea level, and no natural elevations of any description diversify its surface. Numerous rivers and lakes keep the soil charged with moisture; and in the rainy season every depression fills, forming a temporary lake, till dried up by the sun. The general line of drainage is to the south-east. At one time, tree jungle covered a large proportion of the District; but during the last forty years 150 square miles of waste land have been granted to Europeans, but a considerable portion of this has not been brought under cultivation. There are no ravines, and but little \u00fasar (saltpetre) land, so that of the whole area, two-thirds, or 1,169,925 acres, are actually productive; and of the other third, 330,042 acres are cultivable, though not yet under the plough. No waste land now remains at the disposal of Government.\n\nThe rivers R\u00e1pti and Ku\u00e1na divide the District into three natural belts. The northern belt, lying between the R\u00e1pti and the hills, is pure tar\u00e1i (sub-montane) land, reclaimed from the forests and marshes that originally covered it. Its breadth is from 14 to 20 miles throughout. The middle belt lies between the R\u00e1pti and the Ku\u00e1na; and being drained by them, is less marshy, and suitable therefore to wheat and other cereals. The southern belt, lying between the Ku\u00e1na and the Gogra, is much drier, artificial irrigation being in parts required for the ordinary cereals. It is from 12 to 28 miles in breadth. The mean breadth of the District is about 40 miles. The total length from north to south is 60 miles. The chief rivers are\u2014the R\u00e1pti, the Burhi R\u00e1pti, Arrah, B\u00e1ngang\u00e1, Masdih, Ami, Ku\u00e1na, Kura, Kotnaiya, and the Gogra. The last forms throughout the southern boundary of the District, separating it from Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d. It is a river of great volume, in\nplaces from 2 to 3 miles in width, and, owing to the force of its current and the softness of the soil, very destructive by its encroachments on the adjoining land. The Gogra and the R\u00e1pti are the only rivers navigable throughout the year by boats of 25 tons burthen. The other streams are only partially navigable in the rainy season. The largest of the lakes are the Bakhir\u00e1 or Badanah, 5 miles by 2, and perennial; the Pathra, 3 miles by 2; the Chaur and the Chandu T\u00e1ls. They all abound in water-fowl, and for the sport they afford, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of B\u00e1nsi preserves the Pathra and Chaur. In its natural productions Basti has nothing worthy of special note. The only mineral found is kankar (an imperfect limestone), used for road-mending; in the river-beds shells are found in sufficient quantities for the manufacture of lime. The District is well wooded, the trees being those common to the North-Western Provinces generally. The mammals are insignificant, the larger carnivora being almost unrepresented. Spotted deer are found near the Gonda border. Black buck (antelope) are very rare. Hog deer are found in the trans-R\u00e1pti belt, and nilgai all over the District. Birds, especially water-fowl, are exceedingly abundant, and of countless species. Fish abound in all the rivers and lakes, and form an important item in the food supply of the people.\n\nHistory.\u2014Basti has no history of its own. Until 1801, it remained uneventfully a jungle-grown and outlying tract of the Sirk\u00e1r of Gorakhpur, in the Subah of Oudh; and from the cession till 1865 it formed part of the British District of Gorakhpur. Its early history, therefore, belongs to Oudh, its later to Gorakhpur, and since 1865 no events of any public importance have marked its administration.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1872 returned the population of Basti District at 1,473,029. The last Census in 1881 showed a population of 1,630,612, or an increase of 157,583 (10\u00b767 per cent.) in the nine years. The male population in 1881 numbered 824,251, and the female 806,361; proportion of males in total population, 50\u00b754 per cent. Area of District, 2752\u00b78 square miles; number of towns and villages, 7295; number of occupied houses, 268,159. Average density of population, 592 per square mile; number of villages per square mile, 2\u00b76; houses per square mile, 97\u00b74; inmates per house, 6\u00b707. Classified according to religion, the Hindus in 1881 numbered 1,378,416, or 84\u00b753 per cent. of the District population; and the Muhammadans, 252,108, or 15\u00b746 per cent. There were also 78 Christians, 9 Sikhs, and 1 Jew. The Muhammadans, divided according to sect, consisted of 250,265 Sunnis and 1843 Shi\u00e1s. The Christian population comprised 52 Europeans, 1 Eurasian, and 25 natives. The number of Br\u00e1hmans was 183,842; and of R\u00e1jputs, 47,511\u2014the higher castes therefore aggregating 231,353, or 14\u00b75 per cent. of the total population; the Baniy\u00e1s numbered 51,591; and the K\u00e1yasths, 33,542; of Ah\u00edrs there were\n176,298; of Cham\u00e1rs, 220,785; of K\u00farm\u00eds, 123,206\u2014the three latter castes aggregated, therefore, 520,289, or 32 per cent. of the whole.\n\nThe other numerous castes in the District were\u2014Kach\u00eds, 49,622; Kah\u00e1rs, 38,097; Mall\u00e1s, 35,477; Kumbh\u00e1rs, 31,961; Tel\u00eds, 29,194; Dhab\u00eds, 28,430; Soni\u00e1s, 28,085; Barhais, 26,600; Tambul\u00eds, 21,497; Loh\u00e1rs, 19,732; Nais, 19,952; P\u00e1sis, 20,521; Lodh\u00eds, 21,076; Bhars, 18,556; Bhurj\u00eds, 18,364; Bhuinh\u00e1rs, 9977; Gadari\u00e1s, 9225; and Son\u00e1rs, 8251. The villages and towns in the District in 1881 were 7295 in number; and of these 4447 contained fewer than two hundred inhabitants, 2303 under five hundred, 433 under a thousand, 93 under two thousand, 10 under three thousand, 6 under five thousand, 2 under ten thousand, and 1 under fifteen thousand inhabitants.\n\nThere are no large towns in the District. Bast\u00ed with a population of 5536, Mendhawal with 11,592, and Uska with 5079 inhabitants, are the only three having more than 5000 inhabitants. The vast bulk of the total population is rural, being composed of the agricultural classes typical of the North-Western Provinces, and scattered uniformly over the District.\n\nThere are no organized trades-unions in the European sense of the word, but the influential caste panch\u00e1yats, or deliberative assemblies, answer a similar purpose, acting, however, in a much wider field than the ordinary craft leagues in the west of India. Goldsmiths, grain dealers, cloth merchants, and other castes, regulate the customs of their trades by this system. As regards occupation, the Census returns the male population under the following six main headings:\u2014(1) Professional class, including military and civil officers and all Government officials, with the learned professions, 7086; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, 1852; (3) commercial class, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 6330; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, 447,686; (5) manufacturing and artisan class, 31,462; (6) indefinite and non-productive (including 15,945 general labourers, and 313,881 male children and unspecified), 329,835.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The area of Basti is almost entirely under cultivation. In the north, the great expanse of alluvial land, still in parts submerged for half the year, grows rice luxuriantly, and over the rest of the District all the cereals common to the Province are cultivated. The agricultural population numbers 1,395,676, or 85\u00b759 per cent. of the total population, and the area under cultivation aggregates 1,169,925 acres, or 62 per cent. of the total assessed acreage. Total amount of Government land revenue, including rates and cesses levied on the land, \u00a3156,746, or an average of rs. 8\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. Total rental paid by the cultivators, including cesses, \u00a3348,659, or an average of 5s. 10\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. The soil is of three kinds, doras (loam), bhar or b\u00e1lua (light, sandy soil), and m\u00e1tiar (clay),\u2014drier\nin the southern than in the middle belt, and in the middle than in the northern. There are two harvests, the kharif or autumn crop, and the rabi. The kharif crops are sown in May or June, as soon as the first rain has fallen, and are harvested in October and November, and some of the rice in September, or even as early as the end of August; cotton, of which very little is grown in the District, is not ripe for picking till February. Besides cotton and rice, the kharif crops include jowar, locally known as joudhri, moth, etc. The rabi crops are mainly sown in October and November, and reaped in March and April; they consist of wheat, barley, oats, vetch, and peas, and dal or arhar.\n\nFrom the minute sub-division of the land, and the absence of large towns, the population maintains its average density of 592 to the square mile throughout the District, and over nearly two-thirds of the villages the average of inhabitants is under 200. Of the houses, 99 per cent. are built of mud, and the average value of an ordinary agriculturist's personal effects is 10s. His annual expenditure is about \u00a39, 7s. Rice and the cheaper grains form the staple of food, with, in some places, fish. As the cold is never severe, clothing and shelter do not cost so much as in many other Districts. Among Hindus, the cost of living for a family of four persons (man, woman, and two children) would be approximately\u2014(1) for those in the first class, or having incomes over \u00a3100 a year, \u00a390 to \u00a3180; (2) for those in the second class, or having incomes between \u00a320 and \u00a3100 a year, about \u00a320 to \u00a360; and (3) for those in the third class, or with incomes under \u00a320 a year, from \u00a36 to \u00a312. For the Musalmans the cost would be rather more, as their habits are more expensive.\n\nThe price of bullocks for agriculture ranges from \u00a31 to \u00a34, of buffaloes from 14s. to \u00a33, and of cows from 10s. to \u00a35. The rates of interest in force are\u2014in small transactions, on the security of personal effects, from 10 to 12 per cent.; and on personal security only, from 16 to 37 per cent.: in large transactions, on the security of valuables, from 6 to 12 per cent.; on personal security (banker lending to banker), from 6 to 9 per cent.; and on the security of land, from 9 to 18 per cent. The rates of wages are as follows:\u2014Coolies and unskilled town labourers, 2\u00bdd. to 3\u00bdd. a day; agricultural labourers, 2\u00bdd. to 3d. a day; bricklayers and carpenters, 6d. to 2s. a day. Female labourers are paid about one-fifth less than men. The ordinary prices of the chief food grains average as follows:\u2014Wheat, 20 lbs. for 1s.; rice, 15 lbs.; and dal, 26 lbs. Prices have been rather less affected in this District than in others more centrally situated, and nearer the main line of railway; but even in Basti they are rising steadily.\n\nLand Tenures.\u2014None of the District is permanently settled. The tenures of land are the usual zamindari, pattidari, and bhayachara.\nIn the first case, the whole estate belongs to several owners in joint occupation, and is undivided. In the second, the estate has been divided into shares, which are separately held by their several owners; an imperfect form of *pattid\u00e1ri* is very frequent, in which both sets of conditions exist in the same estate. In the third case, though the estate may be virtually either *zamind\u00e1ri* or *pattid\u00e1ri*, the rights of ownership are determined, not by the several ancestral shares of the coparceners, but by custom or possession.\n\n**Natural Calamities.**\u2014The famines experienced in Basti District up to 1865, the year of its establishment as a separate Collectorate, will be described in the article on Gorakhpur. Since 1865 there has been one year of slight scarcity (1868\u201369), and two of severe scarcity, amounting almost to famine (1873\u201374 and 1877\u201378). In all these years the rainfall was deficient, in the latter so seriously as to cause a failure of both the autumn and spring crops, and in the scarcity of 1874 relief works were in operation till May. In the scarcity of 1877, only about one-fourth of the average rainfall fell between the 1st January and the 30th September, and a miserable *khar\u00edf* harvest was followed by a poor *r\u00e1b\u00ed* crop. By the end of June 1878, the average number of persons in receipt of daily relief was 63,908. Relief works were closed in October 1878, but the poorhouses were kept open till the middle of March 1879.\n\n**Commerce and Trade.**\u2014The trade of the District consists to a great extent in the exchange of the cotton, cotton stuffs, and brass of Cawnpur and the Do\u00e1b Districts for the drugs, iron, copper, timber, and forest produce of Nep\u00e1l. By far the most valuable part of Basti trade is in country produce, carried (1) south-eastwards down the principal streams in boats to Gol\u00e1 Gop\u00e1lpur and Barhaj in Gorakhpur, for transit to Patn\u00e1 or Calcutta; or (2) carried south-westwards to Naw\u00e1bganj in Gond\u00e1, and to Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d. The largest market in the District is that of Uska B\u00e1z\u00e1r on the Kura. This place is the principal emporium of the Nep\u00e1l trade in rice and mustard seed, and the seat of fibre manufactures. Large quantities of Basti-grown rice are also brought to this market. The only other trading town of any importance is Mendh\u00e1wal, in the east of the District. Basti itself produces sugar, hides, saltpetre, charcoal, and coarse cloths; it imports cotton, timber, drugs, and iron. The spirit distilled from the petals of the *mahu\u00e1* tree forms a special item of local manufacture and consumption; the dried petals of the *mahu\u00e1* are also used as food for man and cattle. The only fairs of importance are those held at Maghar, Katesarn\u00e1th, Bhar\u00ed, S\u00edt\u00e1r\u00e1mpur, and T\u00e1ura. The Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway runs for 40 miles along the southern border of the District; and from Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d and Akbarpar, two stations on this portion of the line, good roads run into the District. The other important roads are those from Basti and\nNep\u00e1l via B\u00e1nsi, from Singarjot, on the Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d-Basti road, to Bh\u00e1npur, and to Mendh\u00e1wal; from Basti to Dom\u00e1riaganj; and from Uska B\u00e1z\u00e1r to the junction of the Basti-Nep\u00e1l road. Total length of roads, 568 miles. There are 26 post-offices in the District, but no telegraph office. Ferries cross the R\u00e1pti at Dom\u00e1riaganj, Bharota, and B\u00e1nsi. The rivers Ami and Ku\u00e1na are bridged. A bridge of boats is maintained across the Gogra at Ajodhya gh\u00e1t.\n\nAdministration.\u2014For the purposes of revenue collection, the District is divided into five tahsils, viz. Dom\u00e1riaganj, B\u00e1nsi, Haraia, Basti, and Khalil\u00e1b\u00e1d. The land revenue yielded in 1871-72, under the revised settlement, \u00a3133,097, being an increase during the nineteen years preceding of \u00a345,230, or 51.5 per cent. In 1880-81, the land revenue (including cesses) amounted to \u00a3148,330, or an average of about 1s. 9\u00bdd. per head of the population. The District local funds amounted in 1875 to \u00a323,800. The latest Settlement of the District was commenced in 1859, and concluded in 1865. It expires in 1889. In revenue and police matters, Basti is controlled by the Commissioner of the Benares Division. The District staff consists of a Magistrate and Collector, who has generally an Assistant Magistrate and two Deputy Magistrates under him. There are also a superintendent of police, a sub-deputy opium agent and his assistant, and a civil surgeon. The judge of Gorakhpur presides over the civil administration; he has also criminal appellate powers. For administrative and fiscal purposes the District is divided into 5 tahsils or sub-collectorates and 8 parganas with 8377 mahals or estates. The regular police force has a total strength of 422 officers and men. It is maintained at an annual cost of \u00a36416, being equal to \u00a32, 1s. per square mile, or about three-farthings per head of the population. In 1881 there were also 2009 chaukid\u00e1rs or village watchmen, paid in cash by the landholders and villagers, and costing \u00a37248; besides 6546 gorais, really discharging the same duties as chaukid\u00e1rs, but maintained by rent-free allotments of land. The District jail at Basti contained in 1881 a daily average of 305 prisoners\u2014291 males and 14 females. The annual jail mortality averaged 1.31 per cent. The number of Government and grant-in-aid schools in the District in 1881 was 151, of which three were for girls, with a total daily average attendance of 4419 pupils, or one school to every 18.63 square miles, the pupils in the day schools being only .52 per cent. of the male population. These figures are independent of indigenous village schools, which do not come under the supervision of the Education Department. The Census Report of 1881 returned 6723 boys and 121 girls as under instruction, besides 30,184 males and 456 females able to read and write, but not under instruction.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The District is on the whole an unhealthy one, for the excessive atmospheric humidity and the defective drainage combine\nto make fevers prevalent. The average annual rainfall at Basti town for the fourteen years prior to 1880 was 46.63 inches. In 1881 the rainfall was 37.10 inches, or 9.53 inches below the average. The northern portion of the District, being immediately under the hills, experiences a heavier fall. The extreme ranges of temperature on record are from 71\u00b0 F. in January to 105\u00b0 in May 1871, and from 42\u00b0 in January to 78\u00b0 in June 1872. In normal years, the heat in summer is never very intense, nor the cold of the winter months severe, the dampness of the air tempering both extremes. The total number of deaths registered in 1880\u201381 was 48,841, or 30 per thousand. There are 4 dispensaries\u2014at Basti, Birdp\u00far, B\u00e1nsi, and Mendh\u00e1wal; and the patients admitted during 1881\u201382 numbered 26,276.\n\n[For further information regarding Basti, see the Settlement Report of the District (1871) in the Gorakhpur-Basti Settlement Report, and the North-Western Provinces Government Resolution thereon (1873); the North-Western Provinces Gazetteer, vol. vi. pp. 552 to 730 (Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, 1881); the North-Western Provinces Census Report for 1881; and the Provincial Administration Reports for 1880 to 1883.]\n\n**Basti.**\u2014Tahsil of Basti District, North-Western Provinces.

Lat. 31\u00b0 48' 33\" N., long. 75\u00b0 14' 3\" E. Bat\u00e1la is the largest town in Gurd\u00e1spur District, with a population (1881) of 24,281, namely, 8379 Hindus, 15,124 Muhammadans, 757 Sikhs, and 21 'others.' The town was founded about the year 1465, during the reign of Bahlol Lodi, by R\u00e1i R\u00e1m Deo, a Bhatti R\u00e1jput, on a piece of land granted by T\u00e1tar Kh\u00e1n, Governor of Lahore. Akbar gave it in j\u00e1gir to Shamsher Kh\u00e1n, his foster-brother, who greatly improved and beautified the town, and built without it a magnificent tank, which still exists in perfect repair. Under the Sikh commonwealth, Bat\u00e1la was held first by the R\u00e1mgarhias, and after their expulsion, by the Kanhy\u00e1 confederacy. On their return from exile, the R\u00e1mgarhia chiefs again recovered the town, and retained it till the rise of Ranjit Singh. After the annexation of the Punjab, Bat\u00e1la was made the head-quarters of a District, subsequently transferred to Gurd\u00e1spur. Considerable trade, estimated at an annual value of\n\u00a310,000; manufactures of cotton, silk, brass, and leather goods. Some of the coarser qualities of pashmina, or cloth woven from the wool of the shawl goat, are manufactured at Bat\u00e1la. The principal buildings are the court-house, police station, sar\u00e1i, sadr distillery, school-house, post-office, dispensary, two good tanks, massive tomb of Shamsher Kh\u00e1n; handsome building, known as the Anarkalli, erected by Sher Singh, son of Ranj\u00edt Singh, who held Bat\u00e1la in j\u00e1gir; conspicuous Hindu temple. A Mission College and boarding-house for native Christian boys has been established at Bat\u00e1la by the Church Mission Society. The central portion of the town is raised to some height above the surrounding level, with well-paved streets, good drainage, and substantial brick-built houses; but the suburbs consist of squalid mud huts, occupied by Gujar shepherds and low-caste weavers, where filth accumulates to the great detriment of the general health. Municipal income in 1882-83, \u00a31181; expenditure, \u00a31966.\n\nBat\u00e1li.\u2014Frontier village of the Parla Kimidi Estate, Vizagapatam District, Madras Presidency.

Scarped on all sides but one, and crowned by a ruined fort.\n\nBausi (Baansi, Bowsee).\u2014Village in Bh\u00e1galpur District, Bengal; situated near the base of MANDAR HILL. Lat. $24^\\circ 50'$ N., long. $78^\\circ 4'$ E. The numerous buildings, tanks, large wells, and stone figures, found for a mile or two round the base of the sacred hill, show that a great city must once have stood here. The people of the neighbourhood say that it contained 52 markets, 53 streets, and 88 tanks. According to local tradition, on the night of the Dewali festival a large building (the ruins of which still exist, and the walls of which contain an immense number of small holes, evidently intended to hold chir\u00e1ghs, or small native lamps) was formerly illuminated by a hundred thousand of these lights, each householder being allowed to supply only one. How or when the city fell into ruin is not known, though popular tradition ascribes its destruction to K\u00e1la Pah\u00e1r. A Sanskrit inscription on a stone triumphal arch seems to show that the city was in existence less than 300 years ago. After the destruction of the temple of Madhus\u00fadan on Mandar Hill, the image of the god was brought to Bausi, where it now remains. Once a year, on the Paus-Sankr\u00e1nt\u00ed day, the image is carried from Bausi to the foot of the hill, and is swung on the triumphal arch above referred to. From 30,000 to 40,000 pilgrims assemble at this festival from all parts of the country, to bathe in the sacred tank at the foot of the hill, and a fair is held which lasts for 15 days.\n\nB\u00e1vanap\u00e1du.\u2014Town and port in the Tekkali Estate, Ganj\u00e1m District, Madras Presidency.

Excluding certain villages situated below the Western Gh\u00e1ts, the State is bounded north, east, and south by the lands of Panh\u00e1l\u00e1, Karvir, and Bhudhargarh in Kolh\u00e1pur, and west by the Gh\u00e1ts. Estimated area, 83 square\nmiles; population (1881) 39,356; gross revenue, \u00a37783. The land is hilly and well wooded, and the soil generally red. In addition to the local rainfall, which is seldom deficient, four streams pass through the country above the Gh\u00e1ts, and two others water the villages lying at the foot of the hills. For purposes of irrigation, the water both of wells and rivers is raised, in the upland tract, by the rope and leather bag, and in the low-lying villages by the Persian wheel. From the strong damp wind and excessive wet of the rainy season (June to October), the climate of B\u00e1vra is unhealthy, the prevailing disease being dysentery. The chief articles of production are rice, and the usual varieties of grain grown in the Deccan. The only water communication is from the port of Vijayadr\u00fag to the village of Pomburle. A cart-road runs from Bavra to Kolh\u00e1pur, continued by a bridle-path down the Gh\u00e1ts, and so on to Vijayadr\u00fag. There are 6 schools with 240 pupils. The chief is a Hindu of the Bhadanekar family of Br\u00e1hmans, and his title, Panth Am\u00e1tya of B\u00e1vra. The late chief died on the 9th May 1867, and as he left no heirs, M\u00e1dhav R\u00e1o Moreshwar, the present chief, was adopted on the 2nd April 1868; after attaining his majority, he was invested with the management of his estate on the 12th March 1881. He is assisted in the administration by a K\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1ri nominated by the Kolh\u00e1pur Darb\u00e1r. A yearly tribute of \u00a3342 is paid to the Kolh\u00e1pur State. Succession follows the rule of primogeniture, and there is no sanad authorizing adoption. The adoption of the present chief on the 2nd April 1868, was recognised by the paramount power as a special case.\n\n**B\u00e1vra.**\u2014Chief town in the Subordinate State of B\u00e1vra in Kolh\u00e1pur State, Bombay Presidency; 26 miles south-west of Kolh\u00e1pur.

A stronghold of the Thather\u00e1s, the ruins of whose fortress cover several acres of jungle. The expulsion of the Thather\u00e1s is said to have occurred in this way:\u2014R\u00e1ja Jai Ch\u00e1nd of Kanauj deputed two Gaur chiefs to collect the annual tribute from the\nThather\u00e1s in what are now pargan\u00e1s B\u00e1wan and Sara. This they did, but they retained the money and represented that the Thather\u00e1s were rebellious and refused to pay; whereupon the king despatched a strong force against them from Kanauj, put them to the sword, and settled the Gaurs on their lands. For the most part the tract is level, but in the west the ground breaks into slight undulations; it is not watered by any river, but there are numerous jhils, tanks, and wells, by which $\\frac{3}{10}$ of the cultivated area is irrigated. Area, 63 square miles, of which 45 are cultivated. Staple products\u2014barley, wheat, bajra, moth, arhar, millet, sugar-cane, and maskal\u00e1\u00ed.

Lat. $26\u00b0 50' N.$, long. $89\u00b0 36' E.$ It is 32 miles from Kuch Behar town, a good road connecting the two places; about 2 miles from Sontr\u00e1b\u00e1ri, at the base of the mountains, and 6 miles from the Bh\u00fat\u00e1n frontier. The cantonment consists of a rough fort, to which three pickets are attached, situated on spurs at a higher elevation. The plateau is 1800 feet above sea level. Bax\u00e1 was established during the Bh\u00fat\u00e1n war of 1864\u201365, and, on the annexation of the Dw\u00e1rs, a native infantry regiment was stationed here. Bax\u00e1 is now occupied by\nonly a wing of a regiment. New substantial barracks, with stone walls and iron roofs, have recently been constructed, and form part of the fortifications. Two regimental market-places are situated at the west of the fort, and half a mile to the north is a Bhutia village, with about 200 inhabitants. Water is obtained from two perennial streams, one of which issues from the base of the plateau.\n\n**Bax\u00e1r (Baks\u00e1r).**\u2014Sub-division of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bengal, lying between 25\u00b0 15' 45\" and 25\u00b0 42' 30\" N. lat., and between 83\u00b0 48' 30\" and 84\u00b0 24' 15\" E. long.; area, 656 square miles; number of villages, 888; number of occupied houses, 59,433; population (1881) 423,193, namely, 395,153 Hindus, 27,869 Muhammadans, and 171 Christians; average density of population, 645 per square mile; villages per square mile, 1.35; houses per square mile, 105.17; persons per village, 475; persons per house, 7.12.

The place is famous as the scene of the defeat by Sir Hector Munro of M\u00edr Kas\u00edm, the last independent Naw\u00e1b of Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d, in a battle which finally won the Lower Provinces of Bengal for the British (Oct. 22nd, 1764). Bax\u00e1r is a place of great sanctity, and is said to have been originally called Ved\u00e1garbha, 'the womb of the V\u00e9d\u00e1s,' as many of the inspired writers of the Vedic hymns lived here. A Government stud depot, maintained here for some years, has recently been discontinued.\n\n**Bax\u00e1r Canal.**\u2014A branch of the Main Western Canal of the Son (Soane) Canal system, which leaves the Main Western Canal at the twelfth mile from the head-works at Dehr\u00ed, and runs in a northerly direction until it joins the Ganges at Bax\u00e1r.

Situated in a picturesque country, on the B\u00edsnu\u0301r route to Ber\u00e1r and Bombay, the village attained great prosperity; but since the opening of the railway, the traffic by the road has become of less importance. A substantial police station and school-house have lately been built. To the west is a fine masonry reservoir, constructed about thirty years ago; and on the south a fort, much dilapidated, built about seventy years since by Dv\u00e1rkoj\u00ed Naik, a commander of 5000 mercenaries, and commissary-general under R\u00e1j\u00e1 J\u00e1noj\u00ed of N\u00e1gpur.\n\n**Bazitpur.**\u2014Town in Maimansingh District, Bengal.\u2014See Bajitpur.\n\n**Beas (Bi\u00e1s).**\u2014One of the \u2018Five Rivers\u2019 of the Punjab, the Hyphasis of the Greeks (Sanskrit, Vipasa).

Rises in the snowy mountains of Kullu 13,326 feet above the sea, traverses the State of Mandi, and enters K\u00e1ngra District at Sanghol on its eastern frontier. During the early part of its course the fall averages 125 feet to the mile. Forms the main channel for the drainage of K\u00e1ngra, and flows here in a meandering westerly course through hilly country, with a fall of 7 feet to the mile. Elevation at Sanghol, 1920 feet above sea level; at M\u00edrth\u00e1l gh\u00e1t, where it debouches into the plains, 1000 feet. Near Reh in K\u00e1ngra District the river divides into three channels, which reunite shortly after passing M\u00edrth\u00e1l. During its lower hill course the Beas is crossed by numerous ferries, at many of which the means of communication consist of inflated skins (dar\u00e1\u00eds). On meeting the Siw\u00e1l\u00edk Hills in the District of Hoshi\u00e1rpur, the river sweeps sharply northward, to form the boundary between that District and K\u00e1ngra. After bending round the base of the Siw\u00e1l\u00edks, it takes a southerly direction, and divides the Districts of Hoshi\u00e1rpur and Gurd\u00e1sipur. In this portion of its course through the uplands of the Punjab plain, a strip of low alluvial soil fringes\nits banks, subject in flood-time to inundation from the central stream. The main channel is broad and ill defined, full of islands, and expanding from time to time into wide pools. The depth does not exceed 5 feet in dry weather, swelling to 15 feet during the rains. Broad, flat-bottomed country boats navigate this portion of the stream throughout the year. No bridges span the Beas in the Districts of Hoshiarpur or Gurdaspur. After touching Jalandhar District for a few miles, the Beas forms the boundary between Amritsar and the Kapurthala State. At Wazir Bholar gh\u00e1t it is crossed by a railway bridge on the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi line; and a bridge of boats on the Grand Trunk Road is maintained at the same place during the cold season. The channel shifts from year to year through the alluvial valley according to the action of the floods. Finally, the Beas joins the Sutlej (Satlaj) at the southern boundary of the Kapurthala State, after a total course of 290 miles. It ranks sixth in size among the rivers of the Punjab.\n\n**Beauleah.**\u2014Town and administrative head-quarters of R\u00e1jsh\u00e1h\u00ed District, Bengal.\u2014See Rampur Beauleah.\n\n**Beawar (Beawr, Nay\u00e1nagar).**\u2014Town in Ajmere-Merw\u00e1ra Division, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na.

Founded in 1835 by Colonel Dixon, Commissioner of Ajmere-Merw\u00e1ra, in the neighbourhood of the cantonments, Beawar rapidly grew into a prosperous town, owing to its advantageous position between Meyw\u00e1r (Udaipur) and M\u00e1rw\u00e1r (Jodhpur). The plan was regularly drawn out from the beginning, and sites allotted to various traders who applied for shops. Fine wide streets, planted with trees; a stone wall surrounding the town; houses of masonry, with tiled roofs.

Area, 44,139 square miles, with 77,407 villages and towns, and 3,520,896 occupied houses. Population (1881) 23,127,104 souls.\n\nPhysical Aspects, etc.\u2014The country generally is flat, except in the District of Monghyr, where detached hills occur, and in the southeast of the Province, where the R\u00e1jmahal and Sant\u00e1l ranges abut upon the plains. The highest hill is Moher (1620 feet), in Gay\u00e1 District; the range in the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s varies from 800 to 1600 feet in height. The great river is the Ganges, which, entering at Bax\u00e1r and leaving at R\u00e1jmahal, divides the Province into two almost equal portions\u2014the northern comprising the Districts of S\u00e1ran, Champ\u00e1ran, Muzaffarpur, Darbhanga, Purniah, and Maldah, with parts of Monghyr and Bh\u00e1galpur; and the southern containing Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, Patn\u00e1, Gay\u00e1, the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s, and the remainder of Monghyr and Bh\u00e1galpur Districts. Both portions are watered by large tributaries of the Ganges, the chief of these being the Gogra, the Gandak, the Kus\u00ed, the Mah\u00e1nand\u00e1 in the north, and the Son (Soane) in the south. The Behar Canal system, available both for navigation and irrigation, comprises the Son, Arrah, and Baxar Main Canals, with a number of branches and minor distributaries. In 1881\u201382 there were 216\u00be miles of navigable main canal open, with 148 miles of branch canals, and 1034 miles of minor distributaries. The total area irrigated during the year was 178,075 acres, being about 30,000 acres less than in the previous year, due to the favourable rainfall. A Government steamer service is maintained on each of the three main lines of canals. The total number of boats using the Canals in 1881\u201382 was 10,688, of a total burthen of 113,971 tons, carrying cargoes to the value of \u00a3445,358. The canals yielded a total revenue of \u00a373,629 in 1881\u201382, of which \u00a360,393 was derived from water-rates. The working expenses were \u00a345,372, leaving a net revenue of \u00a327,897. A more detailed account will be found of each canal in its alphabetical order. Within the past few years railway communication has much advanced, and considerable further extensions are either in progress or under consideration. Besides the loop and chord lines of the great East Indian Railway, both of which intersect the Province, and after forming a junction at Lakhisar\u00e1i, leave Behar at Baxar, the Patn\u00e1 and Gay\u00e1, and the T\u00edrh\u00fat State Railways are open for traffic. Further extensions of the T\u00edrh\u00fat Railway and its branches are under construction or in course of survey, and new schemes are projected. Other and more detailed information regarding the Province will be found in the separate articles on the Districts composing it, to which the reader is referred for agricultural, administrative, and trade statistics, etc. The most important industries of the Province are the manufacture of opium and indigo.\nPopulation.\u2014Behar forms the most densely peopled Province of India, the pressure of the people on the soil being as high as 524 per square mile, ranging from 287 per square mile in the hilly tracts of the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s to 869 per square mile in S\u00e1ran. The total population of the Province in 1881 was returned by the Census of that year at 23,127,104, on an area of 44,139 square miles, or an increase (allowing for changes of area) of 2,716,503, or 13\u00b73 per cent. in the 9 years since the previous Census in 1872.

This kingdom flourished from the 4th century before the Christian era to the 5th century after it. The Magadha monarchs encouraged arts and learning, constructed roads, and sent their fleets across the Bay of Bengal to colonize Java, Bali, and other islands in the Indian Archipelago. The kingdom is supposed to have attained its greatest grandeur in the time of Seleukos Nikator, one of the immediate successors of Alexander the Great, who invaded Magadha and appointed Megasthenes to represent him at the court at Palibothra, which is supposed to have been on the site of the present city of Patna. But ancient Behar is chiefly interesting as having been, six centuries before the Christian era, the cradle of Buddhism. It sent its missionaries to Ceylon, China, Tartary, and Tibet, and the Province is still regarded as sacred by all Buddhist nations. Numerous buildings and sculptures of great antiquity and interest found throughout the Province show how firmly the religion of Gautama had established itself in this part of India. These Buddhist antiquities will be referred to in the separate articles on the Behar Districts (see particularly articles on Gay\u00e1 District and town, and Buddh Gay\u00e1). In the beginning of the 13th century, Behar came into the hands of the Muhammadans, and from that time it formed one of the three subahs, or Provinces, under the Naw\u00e1b of Bengal. The East India Company acquired it with the diw\u00e1n\u00ed in 1765, when the Province was united with Bengal. [For further information regarding the geography and statistics of Behar Province, see the authorities cited at the end of the articles on the Behar Districts mentioned in the foregoing table, p. 226.]\n\nBehar.\u2014Sub-division of Patna District, Bengal, lying between 24\u00b0 57' 30\" and 25\u00b0 25' 45\" N. lat., and between 85\u00b0 11' 45\" and 85\u00b0 46' 30\" E. long.; area, 793 square miles; number of towns and villages, 2,451; number of houses, 117,199, of which 101,927 were occupied; population (1881) 628,767, namely, 551,467 Hindus, 77,292 Muhammadans,\n7 Christians, and 1 Jain. Average density of population, 793 per square mile; villages per square mile, 3\u00b09; houses per square mile, 148; persons per village, 256; persons per house, 6\u00b017. The Subdivision consists of the th\u00e1n\u00e1s of Behar, Hils\u00e1, At\u00e1 Sar\u00e1i, and Sil\u00e1o. In 1883, it contained one civil and two criminal courts; strength of regular police, 168 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 1344. Throughout this tract are found numerous Buddhist and other antiquities of great interest to the archaeologist. The Province, indeed, takes its name from Vih\u00e1ra, meaning a Buddhist monastery.\u2014See RAJAGRIHA, GIRIVAK, and PATNA and GAYA DISTRICTS.\n\n**Behar.**\u2014Town in Patn\u00e1 District, Bengal, and head-quarters of the Behar Sub-division, situated on the Panch\u00e1n\u00e1 river. Lat. 25\u00b0 11' 28\" N., long. 85\u00b0 33' 50\" E. Population (1881) 48,968, namely, males 23,797, and females 25,171. Hindus numbered 33,668; Muhammadans, 15,296; 'others,' 4. Municipal income in 1881\u201382, \u00a31605, of which \u00a31415 was derived from taxation; expenditure, \u00a31737; incidence of municipal taxation, 6\u00bdd. per head of population within municipal limits; police force for protection of the town, 97 men. Considerable trade is carried on here. All the traffic between Patn\u00e1, Gay\u00e1, Haz\u00e1r\u00edb\u00e1gh, and Monghyr passes through Behar, and travelling traders offer their goods for sale as they pass. Principal articles of trade\u2014European cloth, rice and other grains, cotton, tobacco, etc. Silk and cotton cloths, and muslins rivalling those of Dacca, are manufactured here. About thirty years ago, up-country Muhammadan dealers used to export large quantities of Behar muslins, but these men have now (1883) apparently ceased coming to the town. The most remarkable building in Behar is a large s\u00e1rdi or inn, recently built for the use of Hindu and Muhammadan pilgrims. The tomb of Sh\u00e1h Makhdum, on the south bank of the river, is resorted to by about 20,000 Musalm\u00e1ns once a year, a large fair being held on the occasion. Many other tombs are found in the city, which also contains several ancient mosques, and the ruins of an old fort, covering more than 300 acres of ground. The city is supposed to have been the capital of the ancient kingdom of Magadha, soon after the commencement of the Christian era, but its early history is involved in obscurity.\n\n**Behir.**\u2014Tahsil or Sub-division of B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t District, Central Provinces; area, 1451 square miles; villages, 409; houses, 15,034, of which 14,534 are occupied.

Of the total area of 1451 square miles, 309 square miles form private estates or zam\u00ednd\u00e1r\u00eds, paying a light quit-rent or tribute. Of the Government land (1142 square miles), 531 square miles are assessed for revenue, of which only 72 square miles are cultivated,\nwhile 383 square miles are cultivable, and 76 square miles uncultivable waste. The adult agricultural population is returned at 34,587, or 51.01 per cent. of the total population; average area of cultivated and cultivable land, 8 acres per head of agricultural population. Total amount of Government land revenue (1881), including cesses and rates levied upon land, \u00a31269, or an average of 6\u00bdd. per cultivated acre; rental actually paid by cultivators, including cesses, 10\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. The Sub-division contains 1 civil and 1 criminal court, with 6 police stations; strength of regular police, 46 men; village watchmen (chaukidars), 340.\n\nBehir.\u2014Small village in B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t District, Central Provinces. Situated in the hilly portion of the District, 1987 feet above sea level, and 41 miles north-east of B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t town. Population (1881) 708, chiefly Gonds and Pardhans. Behir must once have been a place of considerable importance, as indicated by the remains of 13 massive temples of hewn granite built prior to the days of mortar. Some are quite plain, apparently Buddhistic; while others are elaborately carved. Three only are now standing. No local tradition exists as to what the place once was, or to whom it belonged.\n\nBehri.\u2014Petty State or jagir in Bundelkhand.\u2014See Beri.\n\nBehror.\u2014Town in Alwar State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Population (1881) 5533, namely, Hindus, 4427; and Muhammadans, 1106.\n\nBehti (Bet\u00ed).\u2014Village in Part\u00e1bgarh (Prat\u00e1pgarh) District, Oudh. Picturesquely situated on the bank of what was formerly a large lake covering an area of about 10 square miles in the rains, and 3 square miles in the dry season. The lake has since been drained by pumping, and the opening up of cuttings leading to the Ganges. To the north is a high bank covered with groves of magnificent trees. The former lake is now entirely under cultivation. It is reported to have been dug by a R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Ajodhya as a votive offering, and was celebrated for wild-fowl and fish; an island in the middle contained an ancient edifice built as a shooting-box by some prince. Population (1881) 1959, namely, Hindus, 1908; and Muhammadans, 51. Two Hindu temples; village school.\n\nBeht\u00ed Kalan.\u2014Town in R\u00e1i Bareli District, Oudh.

Said to have been founded in the time of the Gaul\u00eds. The fort, now in a dilapidated condition, was built by R\u00e1i Singh Chaudhar\u00ed, a large landholder, whose descendants are still m\u00e1guz\u00e1rs of Bel\u00e1. It was twice destroyed during the Pind\u00e1ri troubles. The village is the residence of an Honorary Magistrate.\n\nBelag\u00e1vi (or Balag\u00e1mi).\u2014Village in Shimoga District, Mysore State. Lat. $14^\\circ 24'$ N., long. $75^\\circ 18'$ E.; population (1881) 1428. Celebrated for its ruined temples, which for the taste and finish of their carving are not surpassed by any in Mysore. It was the capital of the Kadamba dynasty, and as early as the 12th century it was regarded as \u2018the mother of cities.\u2019 It abounds with inscriptions, of which sixty-two have been photographed and translated. Its prosperity continued under the Ball\u00e1l\u00e1 kings, and it was probably destroyed when their power was overthrown by the Muhammadans in 1310. Some of the sculptures have been carried away to the Mysore Museum.\n\nBel\u00e1m\u00e1rapalaval\u00e1sa.\u2014Estate in Ganj\u00e1m District, Madras Presidency. Area, 3 square miles.

The District is bounded on the north by the States of Miraj and Jath; north-east by Kal\u00e1dg\u00ed District; east by the States of J\u00e1mkhandi and Mudhol; south and south-east by the Districts of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r and North K\u00e1nara, and the State of Kolh\u00e1pur; south-west by the territory of Goa; and west by the States of S\u00e1wantw\u00e1ri and Kolh\u00e1pur. Extreme length from N.E. to s.w. 120 miles, with a varying breadth of from 50 to 80 miles. Number of villages on the Government rent-roll, 1133. Land revenue (1880\u201381) \u00a3124,860;\ntotal revenue (gross) \u00a3179,370. The lands of the District are greatly interlaced with those of the neighbouring Native States, and within the District are large tracts of native territory.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The country forms a large plain studded with solitary peaks, and broken here and there by low ranges of hills. Many of the peaks are crowned by small but well-built hill forts. The ranges of low hills are generally covered with wild brushwood, but in some cases their sides are carefully cultivated almost to the very summits. The most elevated portion of the District lies to the west and south, along the line of the Sahy\u00e1dri Hills or Western Gh\u00e1ts. The surface of the plain slopes with an almost imperceptible fall eastwards to the borders of Kal\u00e1dgi District. On the north and east, the District is open and well cultivated, but to the south it is intersected by spurs of the Sahy\u00e1dri range, thickly covered in some places with forest. Except near the Sahy\u00e1dri range, and in other places where broken by lines of low hills, the country is almost a dead level. But especially in the south, and along the banks of the larger rivers, the surface is pleasantly varied by trees, solitary and in groups. From March to June the fields are bare, and but for the presence of the mango, tamarind, jack, and other trees, reared for their fruit, the aspect of the country would be desolate in the extreme.\n\nThe principal rivers are the Kistna (Krishna), flowing through the north, the Gh\u00e1tprabha, flowing through the centre, and the Malprabh\u00e1 through the south of the District. From their sources among the spurs of the Sahy\u00e1dri range, these rivers pass eastwards through the plain of Belg\u00e1um on their way to the Bay of Bengal. They are bordered by deeply-cut banks, over which they seldom flow. None of the rivers are serviceable for purposes of navigation. In the west, these rivers and wells yield a sufficient supply of good water; but towards the east they become brackish, and the water-bearing strata lie far below the surface. Except the Kistna, which at all times maintains a considerable flow of water, the rivers sink into insignificant streams during the hot season, and the supply of water falls short of the wants of the people.\n\nThe general character of the geology of Belg\u00e1um District may be described as a trap formation overlaid with laterite detritus. Iron ore is found in some places. In the north are rocks of sandstone and quartz; in the south is found a fine red sandstone, near the Sahy\u00e1dri Hills; and farther east a grey granite, mica schist, and laterite in large quantities.\n\nIn the west of the District, among the spurs of the Sahy\u00e1dri range, is a considerable area of forest-bearing land. Formerly large forest tracts were yearly destroyed by the indiscriminate practice of kum\u00e1ri, or the cultivation of shifting patches of fire-cleared woodland. This form of tillage has now been placed under restrictions. The most important\nforest trees are the teak, blackwood, honne (Pterocarpus marsupium), hirda or myrabolan, and jackwood. There are also a few babul reserves.\n\nOf wild animals, antelope are common, ranging over the black soil plains in herds of from 20 to 40 head. Sambhar deer, wild hog, and hyenas are found in the waste and forest lands. Of the larger beasts of prey, panthers are pretty generally distributed, but tigers are met with only in the south and south-west. Of game-birds there are wild peacock, partridge, quail, snipe, teal, kalam, and occasionally bustard. Except the well-built and agile Mysore cattle, and one or two varieties of buffaloes of northern origin, usually kept by the gaulis or professional milkmen, the local breeds of cattle are poor.\n\nHistory.\u2014The District of Belgaum forms part of the territory ceded under the name of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r by the Peshw\u00e1, in accordance with the terms of the treaty of Poona (June 1818). For some years after the cession, this territory continued to be administered as one District with Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r; but in 1836 it was considered advisable to divide the unwieldy jurisdiction into two parts. Under the arrangements then introduced, the southern portion continued to be known as Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r, and the tract to the north was constituted a separate charge under the name of Belgaum. The first settlement of the District took place in 1848\u201349; in 1881\u201382 re-settlement operations were in progress.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1881 returned a total population of 864,014 persons, or 185\u00b753 to the square mile. Of these, 746,286, or 86\u00b738 per cent., were Hindus; 44,991, or 5\u00b720 per cent., Sr\u00e1waks or Jains; 66,262, or 7\u00b767 per cent., Musalm\u00e1ns; 6322, or 7\u00b73 per cent., Christians; 89 Jews; and 64 P\u00e1rs\u00eds. The males numbered 434,485; the females, 429,529. The percentage of males in the total population is 50\u00b729.\n\nThe people are chiefly employed as cultivators, though a considerable number of the population support themselves by weaving. Among the Hindus the only special class are the Ling\u00e1yats, a peculiar section of the worshippers of Siva. Along the banks of the Kistna, in the north of the District, are many Kaik\u00e1ris, a tribe notorious from the skill of one of its sub-divisions as highway robbers.\n\nOf the 746,286 Hindus, 30,404 are returned as Br\u00e1hmans; 2711 as R\u00e1jputs; and 90,848 as Ling\u00e1yats. Of the 66,262 Musalm\u00e1ns, 66,226 are Sunnis, and only 36 are Shi\u00e1s. Of the 6322 Christians, 1178 are Europeans, 81 Eurasians, and 5063 native converts.\n\nThe languages in use are Mar\u00e1th\u00ed, Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed, and K\u00e1narese. The P\u00e1rs\u00eds employ Guzer\u00e1t\u00ed among themselves, both in conversation and writing. K\u00e1narese is the official language of the District.\n\nOf the whole population, 71,100 persons, or 8\u00b723 per cent., live in towns containing a population of more than 5000 souls. The villages\nare generally shaded by trees, and surrounded by a hedge of prickly pear (Opuntia vulgaris). They are otherwise without defence or fortification. In the west of the District, the houses have roofs of thatch or tile; but towards the east where the rainfall is light, the roof is flat, made of mud and surrounded by a mud parapet. Each village has generally one chief street, in which the richest villagers have their dwellings, with smaller roads branching off at right angles. Except in the larger towns, there are few houses more than one storey high. In country villages, the well-to-do live in houses with walls of brick and doors of wood, of which, in many instances, the posts and lintels are elegantly carved. The foundations of the houses are raised on a plinth generally of hewn stone, 2 or 3 feet above the level of the street. The middle classes live in dwellings with walls of mud and straw, and doors of plaited or woven bamboos; the poor in huts with roofs of thatch and walls of a few bamboos interlaced with millet stalks, sometimes daubed over with mud. Outside the village hedge, a group of carelessly-made hovels form the quarters of the Mah\u00e1rs and other depressed classes.\n\nExclusive of the hamlets, there were, in 1881, 5 towns and 1072 inhabited villages, giving an average of '22 villages to each square mile, and 87'82 inhabitants to each village. The number of houses, occupied and unoccupied, was 188,694, or 40'5 per square mile.\n\nThe chief towns of the District are\u2014(1) Belgaum, with a population of 32,697, inclusive of 9582 in the cantonment; (2) Gokak, population 10,307; (3) Athni, population 11,186; (4) Nipani, population 9777; (5) Saundatti, population 7133; (6) Yamkanmardi, population 4491.\n\nTrade associations or guilds scarcely exist in Belgaum, and the constitution of the village community is but imperfectly preserved. The office of village head-man or p\u00e1tel still remains in many cases hereditary and more rarely stipendiary. By caste, most of the village head-men are Hindus of the Lingayat sect. The office of village clerk, kulkarni, is, with but few exceptions, hereditary in Hindu families of the Br\u00e1hman caste. Almost all villages have watchmen and messengers of the Mah\u00e1r caste. The head-man, clerk, and watchman are paid both in cash and in land. The other members of the full staff of village servants are found in but few villages. The shoemaker, the barber, and the potter still remain, but only as ordinary workmen, having almost completely lost their public character.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014In 1880-81 the total area of arable land in the District was 1,139,050 acres, of which 1,032,253 acres were in occupation; the remainder, 106,797 acres, lay waste. Wet cultivation is carried on to a very limited extent, being adopted only for rice fields and gardens. Irrigated lands in the most favourable situations receive their supply of water by canals from perennial rivulets, or from rivers that have dams\nor weirs thrown across them. The chief varieties of soil are black and red; of these the black is by far the most fertile. It is of two kinds; one so friable, that when swept by a strong wind it rises in clouds of almost impalpable powder. Under foot this soil is heavy, and when impregnated with moisture forms a tough, clay-like substance, almost impervious to water, and therefore very valuable as a lining for tanks. The other variety of black soil is not so tenacious of moisture, and unless it receives abundance of irrigation, either natural or artificial, not nearly so productive. The inferiority of the red soil is due chiefly to the fact that, being of a more sandy composition, it retains moisture for a shorter time. In order to bring a waste of black soil under tillage, the field must receive three complete ploughings\u2014one direct, one transverse, and one diagonal. For the future it does not want any further ploughing; on the contrary, the great aim of the cultivator is to maintain the surface as firm and consistent as possible, and all that is required annually before sowing, is to clear the ground and loosen the surface with a small knife. The red and sandy soils are very apt to cake and harden after rain, so that the object of the farmer is to keep them as loose and friable as possible. For this purpose the field must be ploughed every year; if possible, once lengthwise and a second time transversely. This is done by a smaller plough of the same construction as the large plough used for black fields, but so light that the farmer on his way to and from work may be seen carrying his plough on his shoulder. Fields of pure black soil do not want manure; on the other hand, the out-turn from red and sandy lands seems to depend almost entirely on the amount of dressing they have received. Cultivators are aware that land requires stimulating, but, from the scarcity of firewood, much cow-dung, which would be their best manure, is consumed as fuel.\n\nOn dry fields, most of the grain, pulses, oil-seeds, and fibres are sown; of these some are cultivated on red and sandy soils during the rainy months; others are grown on black soil as a cold-weather crop. Cotton, which is raised entirely on black soil as a cold-weather crop, is usually sown about the middle of August, or rarely in September. Before sowing, the seed is first dipped in cow-dung and water, and then mixed with a little earth, that it may slip easily through the bamboo drill. Cotton is generally sown by itself, but it is sometimes drilled in rows in the same field with a crop of Italian millet (bajra).\n\nThe threshing of the monsoon crops commences in December; of the cold-weather crops, in March. On a convenient part of the field a space of from 12 to 20 yards in diameter is wetted and beaten until it becomes smooth, hard, and firm. In the case of spiked and red millet, the heads are cut off short and thrown upon the ground. The farmer's whole stock of cattle is then fastened abreast to a rope round a post\nfixed in the centre of the threshing-floor. For winnowing, a day is chosen with a moderately strong breeze. The winnower stands on a high stool, and has the grain handed up to him in a small flat basket. Holding the basket at arm's-length, he pours the contents gently over its edge, when the heavy grain falls in a heap at the foot of the winnower's stool, while the chaff is blown away by the wind.\n\nBefore the heap of grain is taken home by the farmer, he has to distribute from it perquisites to the village astrologer, to certain village servants, and to the blacksmith and carpenter, as well as to all sorts of beggars who in the harvest season flock to the threshing-floors. If not intended for seed or immediate use, the grain is usually stored in underground granaries. In order to construct such a grain-pit, the farmer on a somewhat elevated spot, in a hard soil within or near the village, digs a narrow shaft about a cubit in diameter, and 10 to 15 cubits deep. Its sides are then hollowed, so as to form a pit with a roof of about 2 cubits thick. The floor, sides, and roof are lined with straw, and the pit is then filled with grain. Grain meant for immediate consumption is simply stored in front of the cultivator's house, in large cylindrical baskets, smeared inside and out with a plaster of cow-dung.\n\nThe agricultural stock in the possession of the cultivators of State (kh\u00e1s\u00e1) villages during 1880-81 was returned at 59,414 ploughs, 21,320 carts, 174,714 bullocks, 106,957 buffaloes, 87,019 cows, 5845 horses, 159,868 sheep and goats, and 3176 asses. Of the 948,390 acres under actual cultivation in 1880-81, grain crops occupied 683,308 acres, or 72 per cent.; pulses, 102,819 acres, or 10.84 per cent.; oil-seeds, 33,889 acres, or 3.59 per cent.; fibres (including cotton), 104,955 acres, or 11 per cent.; tobacco, 6212, or 0.69 per cent.; sugar-cane, 4443 acres, or 0.49 per cent.; and miscellaneous crops, 12,764 acres, or 1.34 per cent. The current (1881) rates of daily wages are\u2014in towns, for unskilled labourers, from 4\u00bdd. to 6d. (3 annas to 4 annas), and for skilled men, such as carpenters and bricklayers, from 1s. to 1s. 6d. (8 annas to 12 annas) per day. The rates paid to agricultural labourers, who are occasionally engaged in piece-work, are slightly lower. The work of cotton-picking is left entirely to women, who during the season earn about 3d. (2 annas) a day. The prices of the chief articles of food during 1881 were, per maund of 40 sers or 80 lbs.\u2014for wheat, 7s. 11\u00bcd.; for rice, 6s. 10\u00bcd.; for Indian millet or j\u00f3r (Sorghum vulgare), 3s. 9\u00bed.; for Italian millet or h\u00e1jr\u00e1 (Holcus spicatus), 3s. 8\u00bcd.; for gram, 5s. 0\u00bed.; for peas or d\u00e1l, 6s. 8\u00bcd.\n\nTrade, etc.\u2014Belgaum District has no railway or navigable river. There are 137 miles of bridged roads, and 631 miles of roads suitable for fair weather traffic. The capitalists of the District are chiefly M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris and Br\u00e1hmans, but in the town of Belgaum there are a few Musalm\u00e1ns who possess comfortable fortunes. Lying so far\ninland, without railway or navigable river, the District possesses no foreign trade of importance. Cotton is the only article for which the demand is not purely local. European manufactures and other articles required for the European population in the Belg\u00e1um cantonment are brought by shopkeepers from Bombay. In several villages throughout the District markets are held at fixed intervals, usually once a week. These markets supply the wants of the country round within a radius of about 6 miles, containing as a rule from 25 to 30 villages and hamlets.\n\nNext to agriculture, hand-loom weaving forms the chief industry of the District. The weavers are generally Ling\u00e1yats or Musalm\u00e1ns, with a small sprinkling of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. The finer sorts of cloth are manufactured only in two or three towns. With the exception of a small quantity of cloth sent to the neighbouring Districts, the produce of its hand-looms is almost entirely consumed in Belg\u00e1um. Simple dyeing and tanning is carried on over the whole District. Gok\u00e1k town was once famous for its dyers, and is still noted for a coarse kind of paper made in large quantities. Gok\u00e1k toys, made both from light kinds of wood and from a peculiar kind of earth, are also celebrated. They consist of models of men and gods, fruits and vegetables.\n\nAdministration.\u2014For administrative purposes, Belg\u00e1um District is divided into 7 taluks or Sub-divisions, viz. Athni, Belg\u00e1um, Bidi, Chikodi, Gokak, Parasgad, and Sampgaon. The administration in revenue matters is entrusted to a Collector and 4 Assistants, of whom 2 are covenanted civil servants. For the settlement of civil disputes there are 5 courts. In 1880\u201381, the total cost to the State of the maintenance of these courts was \u00a37498, and the amount realized from court fees and stamps \u00a313,196. There are 20 officers for the administration of criminal justice, of whom 6 are Europeans, 4 being covenanted civilians and 2 military officers. In the same year the excise revenue amounted to \u00a312,898, and the license tax produced \u00a34514. In the year 1881, the total strength of the District or regular police force was 674 officers and men, maintained at a total cost of \u00a311,330. These figures show 1 man to every 6\u00b79 square miles as compared with the area, and 1 man to every 1,497 souls as compared with the population. The cost of maintenance was equal to \u00a32, 8s. per square mile, or 3d. per head of population. In 1881, the Belg\u00e1um jail contained a daily average of 683 convicted prisoners, including 13 females\u2014showing 1 prisoner to every 1265 of the population; the total cost was \u00a33864, or \u00a35, 13s. 2d. per prisoner. The District contains 18 post-offices and 1 telegraph office at Belg\u00e1um town.\n\nThe District local funds for works of public utility, and for the spread of rural education, yielded in the year 1880\u201381, \u00a312,203. The disbursements amounted to \u00a36460, expended in the construction of new\nwells, repairs to tanks and old wells, roads, travellers' bungalows, planting out of trees on the roadsides, and for the maintenance of a dispensary. There are 6 municipalities in the District:\u2014Belgaum Town, Gokak, Athni, Nipani, Saundatti, and Yamkanmardi. The total municipal receipts in 1880\u201381 amounted to \u00a36730, and the total expenditure to \u00a35598; the incidence of taxation varied from 6d. to 2s. 3d. per head in the different municipalities. In 1880\u201381, the total amount of revenue raised from the District, including imperial, municipal, and local funds, was \u00a3179,370, showing an incidence of taxation per head of 4s.; the land revenue alone realized \u00a3128,710.\n\nThere are 4 dispensaries and 1 hospital. During 1880\u201381, 17,129 persons in all were treated, of whom 17,030 were out-door and 99 in-door patients. In the same year, 17,432 persons were vaccinated. The total number of deaths registered during the fourteen years ending 1879, was returned at 338,112, being an average yearly mortality of 24,151, or a death-rate of 25\u00b773 per 1000 of the total population; in 1880, the number of deaths was 23,498, or a rate of 27\u00b72 per 1000. During the year 1880, the number of births was returned at 24,184, of whom 12,526 were entered as male, and 11,658 as female children, or a rate of 28\u00b70 per 1000.\n\nIn the year 1880\u201381, there were 195 Government schools, besides 5 missionary schools, or an average of one school for every 6 villages, with an attendance of 12,386 pupils, or 1\u00b743 per cent. of the total population, though, if the percentage were calculated merely on the population of the villages where there are schools, it is 2\u00b79; 9 schools of the above number were for girls, with 368 scholars; in addition there were 233 girls receiving education in mixed schools, making a total of 601 girl scholars. Educational expenditure, from imperial, local, and other funds, \u00a36804. In Belgaum town there are 7 libraries and 1 local newspaper.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014Sometimes in April and May the heat is extreme, and in June and July the air is close and heavy, but on the whole the climate is equable and pleasant to Europeans. For a series of years from 1852 to 1861 the average annual rainfall was 46\u00b732 inches; between 1862 and 1871, 24\u00b777; while for the twenty-two years ending 1881 it was 32\u00b789 inches. In the latter year, the rainfall was 28\u00b757 inches, or 4\u00b732 inches below the average. At the close of the rainy season, in October and November, fevers are common, but at other times, except in the wilder or less cultivated tracts near the Sahyadri Hills, the climate is healthy.\n\nThe only famous place of pilgrimage in the District is the hill of the goddess Yellam\u00e1, in the P\u00e1rasgad Sub-division, on which, twice in the year, at the full moon of April and November, fairs are held, lasting for\nthree days. The number of pilgrims varies from 15,000 to 40,000. The November ceremonies represent the death of Yell\u00e1ma\u2019s husband, and those in April his return to life. In November, the mysteries are performed at a small shrine about a quarter of a mile distant from the main temple. At a certain stage in the ceremony the immense multitude raise a deep wail, not unlike the crone of watchers at an Irish wake. With this mingles a crackling sound, arising from the great throng of women, numbering about two-thirds of the whole assembly, who, in sympathy with the goddess in her widowhood, shatter the glass bangles on their arms.

M. Campbell, C.S.; also the Bombay Census Report for 1881, and the Bombay Administration Reports from 1880 to 1883.]\n\nBelg\u00e1um.\u2014Sub-division of Belg\u00e1um District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 662 square miles; contains 201 villages, of which 122 are Government and 81 alienated. Population (1881) 128,477, of whom 66,709 were returned as males, and 61,768 as females. Of Hindus, there were 110,839; of Muhammadans, 11,151; and of \u2018others,\u2019 6487.\n\nBelg\u00e1um.\u2014Chief town of the District of the same name, in the southern Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 country, Bombay Presidency; situated at an elevation of nearly 2500 feet above sea level, on the northern slope of the basin of a watercourse called the Bellary n\u00e1l\u00e1, an affluent of the M\u00e1rkandi river, which flows into the Gh\u00e1tprabh\u00e1, one of the numerous tributaries of the Kistn\u00e1 (Krishn\u00e1). Lat. 15\u00b0 51\u2032 37\u2033 N., long. 74\u00b0 33\u2032 59\u2033 E.; population (1881) 23,115, including 9582 in the cantonment. The municipal population, numbering 23,115, comprised 16,519 Hindus, 5169 Muhammadans, 1171 Jains, 254 Christians, and 10 P\u00e1rsis. The cantonment contained 5247 Hindus, 1975 Muhammadans, 2 Jains, 2227 Christians, 43 P\u00e1rsis, and 88 \u2018others.\u2019 Municipal revenue (1880\u201381) \u00a33170; rate of taxation, 1s. 11\u00bdd. per head. The native town lies between the fort on the east and the military cantonment, which extends along its western front, separated from it by a water-course. It forms an irregular ellipse, approximating to a circle, of which the shorter axis is about 1300 yards. The rock on which the town is built consists of laterite, lying upon the trap of the Deccan. The site is well wooded. Bamboos, from which Vennugr\u00e1ma, the ancient K\u00e1narese name of the town, is said to be derived, are plentiful, and mangoes, tamarinds, and banyans are also abundant. The fort, about 1000 yards in length and 700 in breadth, is surrounded by a broad and deep wet ditch, cut in hard ground. In 1818, after the overthrow of the Peshw\u00e1, the place was invested by a British force.\nAfter holding out for twenty-one days, the garrison of 1600 men capitulated, having lost 20 killed and 50 wounded, while the loss of the British amounted to 11 killed and 12 wounded.\n\nSince its acquisition by the British, Belg\u00e1um has increased greatly in size and wealth. The large military cantonment contributes to its prosperity, while the school built for the children of natives of rank, adds to its social importance. The principal articles of trade are salt, dry fish, dates, cocoa-nuts, and coir, imported from the sea-coast, chiefly from the port of Vingorl\u00e1. Grain of all kinds, sugar, and molasses are also brought from the country round. The city contains more than 300 looms for the manufacture of cotton cloth. The water supply is entirely derived from wells. Besides the courts and offices of the judge, Collector, Assistant Collector, District superintendent of police, executive engineer, and other District officers, there are 15 Government and aided private schools.\n\nBelgharia (Belghurriah).\u2014Village in the District of the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, Bengal, and a station on the Eastern Bengal Railway; 7 miles from Calcutta. Aided vernacular school.\n\nBeli\u00e1 N\u00e1r\u00e1yanpur.\u2014Village on the right bank of the P\u00e1gl\u00e1 n\u00e1di, in Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bengal. It was formerly in B\u00edrbh\u00fam, but was included in a tract of country recently transferred from that District to Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d. In 1852 it was described as the largest and most important village in the iron-bearing tract of B\u00edrbh\u00fam, and contained 30 furnaces. In 1857, there were 62 furnaces smelting and reducing the iron ore.\n\nBeli\u00e1patam (Val\u00edrpatanam; Billipatam of the Indian Atlas).\u2014River in Malabar District, Madras Presidency. Rising from several sources in the Gh\u00e1ts on the borders of Coorg, it joins at the foot of the hills another large stream flowing from the range in the north-east of Manatt\u00e1na. Immediately below the junction, the united stream is spanned by the Irriti bridge, now (1882) in course of renewal, on the high road from the coast to Coorg and Mysore. From Irikur, where it becomes navigable all the year round for large boats, it flows westward to Irwapuya. Here a third stream, rising from the same sources, joins it; the river widening considerably at the confluence. It then flows past Beli\u00e1patam, and debouches into the sea 4 miles south-west of that town, in lat. 11\u00b0 57' N., long. 75\u00b0 21' E. The numerous plantations of areca and cocoa-nut palms make the scenery of the lower streams very picturesque.\n\nBeli\u00e1patam (Val\u00edrpatanam, Malay\u00e1l\u00edm, Big-town; sometimes supposed to be the Jarfatton of Ibn Batuta).\u2014Town in Malab\u00e1r District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 11\u00b0 55' N., long. 75\u00b0 25' E. Situated on the left bank of the Beli\u00e1patam river, about 4 miles from its mouth, and the same distance from the cantonment of Cannanore. It possesses a\nthriving trade, steamers occasionally calling at the river mouth. In 1735, the Company obtained permission from the Raj\u00e1 of Kolattiri (Chirakkal) to build a fort (named M\u00e1dakkara) near this place; and, as a precaution against the transport of pepper and cardamoms by the river, the grant goes on to say, 'Be careful that our enemy, K\u00e1nara, does not enter the said river in any of his vessels.' Near Beli\u00e1patam, Haidar Ali, in his first descent upon Malabar, gained a signal victory. He used a fleet to transport his horsemen across the river, and the enemy, unaccustomed to cavalry, fled in confusion. A sacred temple stands to the south-east of the town.\u2014See SRIKUNDAPURAM.\n\nBelikeri.\u2014Seaport and village in North K\u00e1nara District, Bombay Presidency, situated 13 miles south of K\u00e1rw\u00e1r town, in lat. 14\u00b0 42' 45\" N., long. 74\u00b0 19' E. The village is famed as a local sanitarium, and contains a large bungalow situated on the sea-shore. Population (1881) 1066.\n\nBelk\u00e1.\u2014Trading village and produce d\u00e9p\u00f4t in Rangpur District, Bengal. Chief trade, jute and mustard.\n\nBelkher\u00e1.\u2014Village in Jabalpur (Jubbulpore) Sub-division, Jabalpur District, Central Provinces. Population (1881) 2033, namely, Hindus, 1640; Muhammadans, 136; Jains, 41; aboriginal tribes, 216.\n\nBelkuch\u00ed.\u2014Town in Pabn\u00e1 District, Bengal; situated on a branch of the Jumn\u00e1 river, which is navigable only in the rainy season. Lat. 24\u00b0 19' 35\" N., long. 89\u00b0 47' 10\" E. Considerable trade is carried on in jute, cloth, rice, and other goods.\n\nBell\u00e1g\u00fap\u00e1.\u2014Village in R\u00e1idrug t\u00e1luk, Bellary District, Madras Presidency. Population (1881) 1719. It marks the commencement of the great unbroken plain of black cotton soil which stretches hence to the Tung\u00e1bhadra river. Near Bell\u00e1g\u00fap\u00e1 are to be seen some curious gallows, with chains and iron cages attached, in which the remains of criminals were formerly exposed.\n\nBellamkond\u00e1 (Billam-Kond\u00e1, Telugu, 'The Hill of the Cave').\u2014Hill in Kistn\u00e1 District, Madras Presidency; 1569 feet above the level of the sea, crowned with the ruins of an old fortress. Taken by Krishna Raya circ. 1515, and by Sult\u00e1n Kul\u00ed Kutab Sh\u00e1h, of Golconda, in 1531 and 1578. Lat. 16\u00b0 30' 40\" N., long. 80\u00b0 3' 30\" E. A village of the same name stands on the high road from Gant\u00far to Nelkonda, at the foot of the hill.\n\nBellary (Ball\u00e1ri, Valah\u00e1ri).\u2014District in the Madras Presidency, lying between 14\u00b0 14' and 15\u00b0 57' N. lat., and 75\u00b0 45' and 77\u00b0 40' E. long.; area (including the native State of Sand\u00far) 5904 square miles; population in 1881 (including the State of Sand\u00far, 10,532), 736,807. The river Tung\u00e1bhadra bounds it on the north and north-west, separating it from the territories of the Niz\u00e1m; on the east lie the Districts of Anant\u00e1pur and Karn\u00fal (Kurnool); on the south is the District of\nChitaldr\u00fag in the Mysore State; and on the west, the river Tung\u00e1bhadra separates it from Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r District of the Bombay Presidency. In point of size, Bellary now ranks twelfth, and in population eighteenth, among the Districts of the Madras Presidency; before a part of it was formed into the new District of Anant\u00e1pur, it ranked second in area, and thirteenth in population. It is sub-divided into 8 taluks, and contains within its limits the native State of Sand\u00far, which has an area of 164 square miles. The number of inhabited villages is 1174, and of towns, 10. Land revenue (1881-82), \u00a3185,549; total revenue (gross), \u00a3253,513.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The general aspect of the District is a vast surface of treeless plain, broken at rare intervals by granite masses that spring abruptly from the surrounding sheet of black cotton soil, like rocks from the sea. Bellary is in fact an extensive plateau, tilted up in the west on the shoulders of the Gh\u00e1ts, and sloping down towards the eastern coast. At Belg\u00e1um, on the west, the height of the plain is 2568 feet, and at Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r 2586 feet above the sea level; at Gemtakal junction station of the Madras Railway, near the eastern boundary of the District, the elevation is 1451 feet. Water is very scarce throughout, and vegetation is accordingly rare. The Tung\u00e1bhadra, forming the northern boundary, contains water all the year round, and in the rainy season swells to formidable dimensions; its southern tributaries, the Hagari, the Vedav\u00e1ti, and others, drain the District, and on its banks stand the towns of Hamps\u00e1g\u00e1ra, Hospet, Sirug\u00fap\u00e1, Hampi, Kampli; at R\u00e1mpur a fine bridge of 52 piers carries the railway across the stream. The Vedav\u00e1ti rises in Mysore, and after a course of 125 miles in the District joins the Tung\u00e1bhadra near Halikota. Though very shallow for two-thirds of the year, this river when in flood overflows its banks, and in 1851 washed away the town of Guliem. The only hill ranges worthy of note are situated in the vicinity of Sand\u00far and Kampli in the west, and the Lank\u00e1 Malla in the east; between these, scattered generally over the District, occur detached masses of granitic rock. Iron of good quality abounds, and copper, lead, antimony, manganese, limestone, and alum are all found. Salt and saltpetre are extracted from the soil. The fauna of the District includes among mammals, the tiger, panther, hunting leopard, wolf, black bear, hy\u00e1ena, wild boar, antelope, and s\u00e1mbhar deer; the first and last being very rare. Among birds, the order of Rapt\u00f3res is largely represented: the bustard, florican, pea-fowl, partridge, quail, snipe, goose, and water-fowl afford excellent sport. Venomous snakes abound. The flora is scanty,\u2014the bab\u00fal (Acacia Arabica), b\u00e9\u00e9r (Zizyphus jujuba), and wild date (Elate sylvestris) being the chief indigenous trees; but in groves and gardens are found the mango, tamarind, cocoa-nut palm, banyan, and n\u00edim.\n\nHistory.\u2014The historical details which follow relate to the old District\nof Bellary, before Anantapur District was formed. Within the Hospet taluk of Bellary lies the site of the ancient city of Vijayanagar, and its annals therefore date back to the first Muhammadan invasion of the Deccan, in the 14th century. But it is not until 1640, when Shivaji, the Maratha, received a formal grant from the Sultan of Bijapur of the forts of Bellary and Adoni, with the country adjacent, that the tract corresponding to the present District may be said to have entered upon a separate history. The District round Guti (Gooty) remained subject to Golconda, but farther south (yet still within the old District of Bellary) the Palegars of Raidurg, Anantapur, and Harpanhalli became tributary to the Marathas. Shivaji died in 1680, and soon afterwards Aurangzeb advanced upon the Deccan with the Imperial army and overran the District. His authority, however, was never formally established; and the revenues of Bellary were farmed out to the Palegars, who deducted what they chose for military and other expenses, and remitted the balance to the Imperial treasury. After the death of Aurangzeb, and the rise of the Nizam's power, several of the Bellary chiefs, notably those of Guti (Gooty) and Sandur, asserted a semi-independence. Meanwhile Mysore had risen to strength; and, on the death of the Nizam, Haidar Ali, the usurper of the Mysore throne, accepting the invitation of Basalat Jang, the governor of Adoni, to assist him against the Marathas, overran the District of Bellary. The Marathas soon took the field in force to regain the country and fortresses they had lost; and Haidar Ali, defeated at Rattihalli, was compelled to abandon all his conquests except Raidurg, Chitaldrug, and Harpanhalli.\n\nThe Mysore war broke out in 1767, and Haidar Ali, to recruit his finances, began to levy contributions from the surrounding Districts. Gooty, however, again resisted his demands, and at Bellary, then a dependency of Adoni, he fared no better. But soon afterwards (1774) the Palegar of Bellary, Basalat Jang, withheld payment from the Nizam, and M. Lally was sent with a force to reduce him to obedience. He appealed for help to Haidar, who defeated the Adoni troops, but kept Bellary for himself. A third attempt upon Gooty was successful; and, making it his head-quarters, Haidar continued to hold his own for two years against both the Marathas and the Nizam. Throughout these campaigns the Palegars of Chitaldrug, Raidurg, Harpanhalli, and other divisions of the District, acted as the acknowledged tributaries of Mysore. On Haidar's death all asserted their independence; but Tipu, who had succeeded his father, captured their fortresses one after the other, put the chiefs of Raidurg and Harpanhalli to death as a warning to the rest, and collected all their arms and stores in the strongholds of Gooty and Bellary. But, arousing the hostility of the British Government, Tipu was in 1789 involved in war; and on the\nconclusion of peace, and the partition of Tipu's last conquests, the Bellary District was made over to the Niz\u00e1m. War, however, again broke out; and on the capture of Seringapatam and death of Tipu (1799), a redistribution was effected\u2014Bellary District being divided between the Niz\u00e1m and the Peshw\u00e1.\n\nIn 1800, the Peshw\u00e1's share was resumed; and the Niz\u00e1m, in exchange for a subsidiary force of British troops, ceded to the Company the tract acquired by the treaties of 1792 and 1799, including Adoni and the remainder of the District of Bellary. The first attempt of the Company to collect the revenue of their new territory provoked a general rebellion of the P\u00e1leg\u00e1rs, but a force under General Campbell expelled the more turbulent from their estates, and awed the rest into submission. The revenue administration was then taken out of their hands entirely, and the maintenance of armed bodies prohibited, the whole of the ceded Districts being formed into a Commissionership under Colonel Monro as principal Collector (1800), and on his retirement (1807) re-cast into the two Districts of Cuddapah and Bellary, with a Collector to each.\n\nSince that date the peace of the District has been only twice disturbed. In 1818, the Pind\u00e1r\u00eds made a raid, plundering Harpanhalli and making ineffectual assaults on Kudlighi and R\u00e1idr\u00fag. A force was despatched from Bellary, and without difficulty expelled the marauders. In 1857 there was a rising in Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r District, and the tahs\u00edld\u00e1r of Harpanhalli joined the insurgents with a force collected within his jurisdiction. They marched upon R\u00e1mandr\u00fag, but were overtaken by British troops at Kop\u00e1l\u00e1. Their defences were stormed by a wing of the 74th Highlanders, and the disturbance was quelled.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1881 returned a total population for the present District of Bellary (including the State of S\u00e1nd\u00far, 10,532) of 736,807 persons, as compared with 926,751 in 1871, or a decrease of 20\u00b75 per cent., due to the famine of 1876-78. The population inhabited 10 towns and 1174 villages, in an area of 5904 square miles, and occupied 144,290 houses. Number of persons per square mile, 125, varying from 177 in Hospet taluk to 64 in S\u00e1nd\u00far; number per occupied house, 5\u00b72. In point of density Bellary stands eighteenth among the Districts of the Madras Presidency. The males numbered 373,948, the females 362,859, the proportion being 508 males to 492 females in every 1000 of the population. Of children under 10 years, there were 78,204 boys and 80,957 girls: total, 159,161. Classified according to religion, 662,072, or 89\u00b78 per cent. of the total population, are Hindus; 69,767, or 9\u00b75 per cent., are Muhammadans; 4140, or 0\u00b75 per cent., are Christians, chiefly Roman Catholics; 620 are Jains; and 'others,' 208. Among the Christians are included 552 Europeans and 127 Eurasians. Classified according to sect, the Hindus are nearly\nequally divided between Siva and Vishnu worshippers, the small remainder being returned as 'Lingayats and others.' Classified according to caste, the Hindu population was distributed as follows:\u2014Br\u00e1hmans, 15,375, or 2\u00b73 per cent.; Kshattriyas, 2622, or 0\u00b74 per cent.; Shetties (traders), 11,260, or 1\u00b77 per cent.; Vall\u00e1rs (agriculturists), 99,893, or 15\u00b71 per cent.; Id\u00e1iyars (shepherds), 97,955, or 14\u00b78 per cent.; Kamm\u00e1lars (artisans), 22,559, or 3\u00b74 per cent.; Kaikalars (weavers), 28,668, or 4\u00b73 per cent.; Vanniyans (labourers), 2789, or 0\u00b74 per cent.; Kushavans (potters), 6191, or 0\u00b79 per cent.; Sat\u00e1n\u00eds (mixed castes), 46,891, or 7\u00b71 per cent.; Shembadavans (fishermen), 124,906, or 18\u00b78 per cent.; Sh\u00e1n\u00e1ns (toddy-drawers), 6290, or 0\u00b79 per cent.; Ambattan (barbers), 6189, or 0\u00b79 per cent.; Vann\u00e1ns (washermen), 13,838, or 2\u00b71 per cent.; Pariahs, 84,530, or 12\u00b77 per cent.; 'others,' 91,634, or 13\u00b78 per cent.\n\nThe Muhammadans are almost entirely Sunnis. Classified according to occupations, 10,795 were returned as belonging to Class I., or professional, of whom 612 were females; 4106 to Class II., or domestic, of whom 1407 were females; 10,543 to Class III., or commercial, of whom 1923 were females; 301,351 to Class IV., or agricultural, of whom 118,152 were females; 94,055 to Class V., or industrial, of whom 45,124 were females; and 315,957 to Class VI., or indefinite and non-productive, of whom 195,641 were females. About 58\u00b79 per cent. are returned as workers, on whom the remaining 41\u00b71 per cent. of the population depend. Among the males, 69\u00b78 per cent., and among the females, 47\u00b77 per cent., were workers. The only caste calling for special notice is the vagrant Kor\u00e1chavandlu\u2014the distinctive criminal class of the District. They speak a gipsy dialect of their own, and their features bespeak a Tartar origin. In manners and customs they differ radically from all their neighbours. Their houses are of mats woven from water-grass; they eat three times a day, and rats and mice find a regular place in their dietary. They revere neither temples nor Br\u00e1hmans, and bury their unmarried dead. Early marriages are unknown among them, and a man can have only one lawful wife. The proportion of educated persons to the total population of each religion was\u2014Hindus, males 12\u00b76 per cent., females 0\u00b74; Muhammadans, males 11\u00b71 per cent., females 0\u00b77; Christians, males 57\u00b79 per cent., females 27\u00b76.\n\nThe chief among the 10 towns returned in the Census report of 1881 as being in the present District of Bellary are\u2014Bellary, the headquarters of the District, with a population (including the garrison) of 53,460; Adoni, 22,441; Hospet, 10,219; Kampti, 9828; Raidrug, 8766; Yemiganur, 6963; and Harpanhalli, 6536.\n\nK\u00e1narese and Telugu are the languages spoken, the former language prevailing in the western, and both being used in the eastern t\u00e1luks.\nAgriculture.\u2014Of the total area (3,762,286 acres), 3,574,594 were in 1881\u201382 returned as assessed; 40,154 acres for the first crop, and 1941 for the second,\u2014total, 42,095 acres,\u2014were cultivated under irrigation; and 1,365,639 were cultivated without irrigation: total cultivated area, 1,497,734 acres. The cultivable area not under cultivation was returned at 2,087,995 acres; pasture and forest lands, 98,347 acres; and barren or waste lands, 170,524 acres: total uncultivated area, 2,356,866 acres. Of the total area, 815,300 acres are held in in\u00e1m, or revenue free. The cultivated area is officially divided into \u2018wet\u2019 and \u2018dry\u2019 lands. \u2018Dry\u2019 land is that in which there is no artificial irrigation. The chief crops are cholam, r\u00e1gh, and korra, and on these depends the food supply of the masses. \u2018Wet\u2019 lands, or those artificially irrigated, are almost exclusively devoted to rice and sugar-cane. On other \u2018dry\u2019 lands are raised cocoa-nut, betel leaf, plantains, areca-nut, wheat, tobacco, chillies, turmeric, vegetables, and fruits. Cotton is grown on dry land, the regar, or \u2018black cotton soil,\u2019 being the soil always preferred, the out-turn on the red ferruginous or grey calcareous soils being on the average only 25 per cent. of that on the black soil. A fair crop would be 240 lbs. of uncleaned, or 60 lbs. of cleaned, cotton. Exotic varieties of cotton (Hingangh\u00e1t, New Orleans, Sea Island, etc.) have been tried, and have hitherto failed. The total area under the various crops is thus estimated\u2014grain crops, 1,117,878 acres; orchard and garden produce, 9881; tobacco, 4061; hemp and other drugs, 1237; condiments and spices, 6759; sugar-cane, 8448; sugar palms, etc., 2161; oil-seeds, 50,512; cotton, 205,895; indigo, 323; jute, 715; flax and other fibres, 664 acres. Manure, wherever obtainable, is applied, and the use of green foliage for this purpose, in \u2018wet\u2019 lands, is almost universal. No regular rotation of crops obtains, but the principle that two exhausting crops should not be sown successively on the same field is everywhere recognised.\n\nAccording to the statistics of 1881\u201382, there were in the District 11,757 buffaloes, 120,883 bullocks, 49,560 cows, 9022 donkeys, 89,566 goats, 169,122 sheep, 694 horses, 2218 ponies, 112 mules, 77 camels, 13,764 pigs, 56 boats, 13,264 carts, and 58,983 ploughs. The prices of produce ruling in the District at the end of 1881\u201382, per maund of 80 lbs., were\u2014for rice, 6s. 3d.; for wheat, 4s. 4\u00bdd.; for other grains, from 2s. to 4s. 9d.; for salt, 8s.; for sugar, 26s. 6d.; for linseed, 6s. 3d.; and for cotton, 7s. The price of field bullocks ranges from \u00a33, 16s. to \u00a310 a pair; and of sheep, 6s. to 7s. each. Buffaloes, though cheaper, are seldom used. The agricultural implements correspond in character to those in use in Europe, but are all of the most primitive kind. An improvement, however, has been remarked of late in many points. Thus the old cart with solid wheels of stone or wood, the axle revolving with the wheel, is giving place to open wheels, with tire, spokes, and\nfixed axle. Again, in outbreaks of cattle distemper, the efficacy of segregation has of late been recognised.\n\nThe cultivated area is parcelled out into 76,087 separate holdings, the average holding being about 15 acres of 'dry' and 0.46 acres of 'wet' land; the average assessment is \u00a31.5s.d. per acre of 'dry,' and \u00a31.1s.4\u00bdd. per acre of 'wet' land. Of the total number of landholders, 49,406, or more than half, occupy holdings paying less than \u00a31; only about 13,337 occupy holdings paying more than \u00a33 per annum. The 'wet' land of the District stands on the official register at 2 per cent. of the total area; the sources of irrigation being tanks of all sizes (454), river channels (101), spring channels (418), and wells (8731).\n\nPrices have for many years been steadily rising; and where money payments obtain, agricultural labourers and ordinary artisans now receive double, and even treble, the wages given before 1850. The field labourers, however, are, as a rule, paid in kind, and the rise of prices, therefore, has not affected them. In other respects, the cultivator class has benefited, the cotton-growers notably, many of whom during the American war made considerable fortunes. Rice during 1840-50 averaged 24 lbs. for the shilling; between 1850-60 it rose to 20 lbs., and since 1860 has averaged 10 lbs. for the shilling; cholam during the same period rose from 58 to 38 and 23 lbs. for the shilling, and r\u0101gi from 62 to 46 and 25 lbs.; cotton also rose in value from 68 shillings per candy to 110 and 292 shillings.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014The earliest famine recorded is that of 1792-93. In that year rice sold at 4 lbs. for the shilling, and cholam, the staple food of the masses, at 12 lbs. for the shilling. In 1803, prices rose 300 per cent., and wholesale emigration took place. In 1833, the year of the Gant\u016br (Guntoor) famine, when in that District 150,000 persons, out of a total of 500,000, perished from want of food, cholera followed the famine, and in Gooty (G\u016bti) and Bellary 12,000 persons died during the outbreak. Grain riots occurred in several places, and there was a considerable mortality from starvation. Disasters, local in their incidence, accumulated in Bellary between the years 1851-54. A storm swept over the District, damaging the tanks and irrigation works, in 1851; and before the repairs were completed, heavy and unseasonable rainfall (1852) ruined the crops. In 1853, the total fall of rain was only 6 inches, and famine set in. One-third of the cattle in the District died, but owing to the prompt recourse to relief works the mortality among the people was not great. In 1866, the failure of the rains doubled the price of food, and relief works being opened, 21,000 persons crowded to them. Cholera broke out, and in many villages the death-rate was so high that the panic-stricken inhabitants ceased to burn or bury their dead. The storm of 1851, above referred to, was of remarkable violence, and, being accompanied by torrents of rain, swept away the towns of Guliem and\nNagaradona, as well as several villages, destroyed the roads and canals, and breached 253 of the largest tanks in the District. Much valuable land was rendered sterile by the deposits of sand, and the loss in property and cattle was enormous. Bellary formed one of the Districts most severely affected in the great famine of 1876-77. It was the centre of an extensive system of organized relief, both in the shape of public works and gratuitous distributions of food.\n\nCommerce and Trade.\u2014Among the agricultural products of the District, cotton takes the first place. In the raw state it is largely exported both to Madras and Bombay, where it is pronounced equal to the best Western growth; and the manufacture of cotton goods\u2014cloth, rope, tape, and carpets\u2014occupies large numbers of the people. Oil-seeds, sugar-cane, hemp, and indigo, all represent important mercantile interests. In woollen goods, the chief articles of export are the blankets of the Kudlighi taluk, for which there is a demand all over the Madras Presidency. The woollen carpets, however, cannot compete with those of Eloffre and Mysore. Chintz-stamping still forms an important industry in the Gooty taluk of Anantapur District, where also there is a considerable manufacture of glass bangles. Iron-smelting is carried on in the Hospet and other taluks.\n\nA portion of the Madras Railway (north-west line), 56 miles, runs just within the north-eastern boundary of the District, passing the town of Adoni, a branch line from Guntakal station, 32 miles in length, being carried due west to the town of Bellary. A section of the Southern Maratha State Railway also falls within the District, running for a distance of 40 miles, due west, from Bellary to Hospet. There are 974 miles of imperial and local roads. A District road cess, levied at the rate of about 1\u00bdd. in every 2s. of land revenue, provides for the maintenance of the roads. The principal ferries over the Tungabhadra are at Hampsagra, Hathalli, and Madavaram, and those over the Hagari at Permadavanhalli and Moka. The right of ferrying is rented out at about \u00a3900 per annum, which supplements the regular road fund. Numerous local funds contribute to the District revenue. The 'public bungalow fund,' derived from the fees paid by travellers for accommodation in the public rest-houses; the pound fund and the chaultri fund, derived from economies in the administration of the resources of endowed charities, sufficiently denote the institutions of the District. A District Gazette is published in the town of Bellary monthly, and a private printing-press is also maintained.\n\nAdministration.\u2014Until 1808, when Bellary was first recognised as a separate District, its history forms part of that of the Ceded Provinces generally. With the rest it suffered throughout all the changes of government from anarchy and extortionate revenue collectors. In 1800, when the District was ceded to the Company, it was found that\n30,000 armed men, in the pay of 80 different chiefs, were quartered upon the people, and maintained entirely by forcible requisitions from the cultivating classes. Colonel Monro, the first Collector, surveyed the Ceded Provinces, Bellary included; and, assessing the lands at something below the average of the nominal revenue under the Mysore rulers and the Niz\u00e1m, settled for each field directly with the actual cultivator. The revenue collections from the Bellary taluks, during the nine years in which this system obtained, averaged annually \u00a3227,142. In 1808, the Ceded Tracts were divided into the two Districts of Bellary and Cuddapah; and when the system of triennial leases was introduced in the following year, the revenue collections in Bellary alone rose to \u00a3249,514 per annum. In 1812, the triennial leases were changed to decennial, the result being at the end of the ten years a decreased average of receipts, \u00a3243,207,\u2014a decrease owing to the general reduction of assessment directed in 1820. In 1822, the original system of settling with the cultivators direct was reverted to, and a further general decrease of assessments introduced. The result was a further reduction of the average of land revenue, pure and simple, between the years 1822 and 1830 to \u00a3207,373 per annum; between 1830 and 1840 it rose to \u00a3292,000; between 1840 and 1850, fell again to \u00a3221,000; and between 1850 and 1869, rose to \u00a3336,000.\n\nOn the 5th January 1882, the old Bellary District was divided into the two Districts of Anant\u00e1pur and Bellary. For administrative purposes the present District is sub-divided into the following 8 taluks, namely, Adoni, Allur, Bellary, Harpanhalli, Havinhudgalli, Hospet, Kudlighi, and Raidrug. Including Anant\u00e1pur, the total net revenue of the District in 1881\u201382 amounted to \u00a3253,583, as follows: land revenue, \u00a3185,561; \u00e1kkari (spirits and drugs), \u00a349,187; stamps, \u00a315,617; assessed taxes, \u00a33218. Under the name of motarfa a tax had from an early period been levied from the non-agricultural classes, and being continued under British administration until 1837, yielded, on the average, \u00a328,206 per annum. In 1860, motarfa was formally abolished, and the income tax imposed. This in turn was abandoned in 1865, between which date and 1869 various substitutes, in the shape of licence and certificate taxes, were tried. In 1869 the income tax was again established, and was continued at various rates till 1873. The licence tax has been levied since 1878.\n\nCivil justice is administered by four grades of courts,\u2014the village munsif's; the District munsif's; the subordinate judge's; and the court of the District judge. The last is also the sessions court for criminal cases; subordinate to it are the village magistrates, the subordinate magistrates, and the full power European magistracy. For the confinement of prisoners there is a sub-jail in each taluk, with one District jail at Bellary. The last is capable of holding 400 prisoners.\nThe village police of the District aggregates a total strength of 1574. The regular police force numbered in 1881-82, 698 officers and men of all ranks, being in the proportion of 1 to every 1077 of the population. The total cost of maintenance of the force in that year amounted to \u00a318,400. The municipalities are 2 in number\u2014Bellary and Adoni\u2014with annual incomes of \u00a38000 and \u00a32000 respectively, expended yearly to almost the full amount in local improvements. Education of an elementary kind is carried on in the pidil or village indigenous schools, of which there were in 1882, 267 with an average attendance of 4800 pupils, one or more of these schools being established in every considerable hamlet. For higher-class teaching, grants in aid are given to 10 schools, while 2 Anglo-veracular and 1 Provincial school at Bellary with a daily attendance of 320 are supported by Government, the fees of the scholars covering only about a third of the expenses. The London Missionary Society and the Roman Catholic Church have old-established missions in the District, maintaining between them several schools and two asylums for the poor.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate is extremely dry, the average annual rainfall being only 20 inches. The daily temperature ranges from 67\u00b0 to 83\u00b0 F. in November and December, and rises to an average of 93\u00b0 during April, the yearly mean from January to October inclusive being 84\u00b0. Since 1820, eighteen years have been officially recorded as seasons of epidemic cholera, the mortality in 1845 being 18,000, and in 1866 over 20,000. Fever exists in an endemic form, but in 1834, 1841, and 1866, the mortality from this cause was especially high; in 1880 the number of deaths was returned at 9559. Ophthalmia is common, owing to the dryness of the atmosphere and the glare from the granite rocks. Cattle-disease was epidemic in 1842, 1843, and 1844; occurring again in 1847, 1848, and 1849. In 1857, the loss of cattle from murrain was very great, as also in 1868. Gratuitous medical advice and attendance is provided for the poorer classes by the civil dispensaries at Harpanhalli, Kadlighi, Allur, Hospet, Adoni, and Bellary\u2014the expenses being defrayed partly by local subscription, but mainly by municipal grants. These dispensaries, as a rule, are only resorted to by the poor after charms and exorcisms have failed. The mortuary returns for the District during the three years ending 1870 gave an average mortality of 21,000, or about 13 per thousand on the total population. In 1880 the total number of deaths from all causes amounted to 26,227, or about 16 per thousand. [For further information regarding Bellary, see the Manual of the Bellary District, by J. Kelsall, Esq., C.S. (Madras, 1872). Also the Madras Census Report for 1881, and the Madras Provincial Administration Reports from 1880 to 1883.

Situated between lat. 14\u00b0 57' and 15\u00b0 42' N., and long. 76\u00b0 44' and 77\u00b0 16' E.; area, 925 square miles; containing 162 towns and villages, with 29,359 houses, and a total population in 1881 of 148,937, being 75,821 males, and 73,116 females. Land revenue (1881-82) \u00a327,507; excise, \u00a36620. The taluk lies in the angle formed by the Tungabhadra and Hagari rivers, a level expanse of black cotton soil. The Copper mountain, so called from the mines worked by Haidar Ali, and the Bellary Rock, on which the fort is built, are the only important physical features. Nearly two-thirds of the total area are under cultivation, of which about 7000 acres are artificially irrigated. The tanks, 5 in number, are all insignificant. The channels from the rivers irrigate only 4000 acres, and the normal rainfall is very light. This taluk, therefore, is considered one of the most arid in the District. It contains three civil and three revenue courts.\n\nBellary (Valahari).\u2014Chief town of Bellary District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 15\u00b0 8' 51\" N., long. 76\u00b0 57' 15\" E.; houses, 10,611; population (1881) 53,460, namely, 34,636 Hindus, 15,068 Muhammadans, 3566 Christians (including the European garrison), and 190 'others;' municipal income (1881-82) \u00a36000; incidence of taxation per head, 1s. 1\u00bdd. Being the head-quarters of the District Administration, and of a brigade of the Madras army, Bellary possesses all the public establishments and offices pertaining to a civil and military station of the first class. Situated on an arid plain that stretches from the foot of a mass of granitic rock, 450 feet in height and about 2 miles in circuit, the town is defended by two lines of fortifications. The upper fort crowns the rock, and being inaccessible in the face of even the smallest force, may be considered impregnable by assault. The lower fort, containing the arsenal, guards the eastern base. On this side stand several public buildings, including the post-office and commissariat stores. Southward stretches the native quarter, Cowle Bazar, Bruce-pettah, and Mellor-pettah, containing the finest military market in Southern India. A large tank, nearly 3 miles in circumference when quite full, but which, being very shallow, is as a rule dry for a part of every year, lies on this side of the rock. On the west are grouped the regimental lines, substantial buildings with accommodation for two European and two Native regiments; the present force consists of one regiment of British infantry, a battery of artillery, two regiments of Native infantry, and one of Native cavalry\u2014total strength, 2809. On the northern side stand the civil lines, with the public offices, churches, dispensary, and school, railway station and telegraph office. By rail, Madras is 305 miles distant.\nThe climate being very dry (in consequence of the winds passing over such an extent of heated plain), Bellary is considered a healthy station; but the heat is great, the mean registered in April being $93^\\circ$ F., and the normal annual rainfall amounts to only $16\\frac{1}{2}$ inches. Of late years, water has been scarce, having fallen to a lower level in the wells. The old springs seem to be drying up, and much of the water now produced is too brackish for use, owing to the presence of chloride of soda and carbonate of lime in large proportions in the soil. Trees are grown with greater difficulty, and gardens are becoming few. The opening of the railway has given an impetus, however, to the cotton traffic and the trade of the town. No local manufactures of importance exist. The history of Bellary dates from the reign of Krishna R\u00e1ya of Vijayanagar. A dependant of that court built a fort here; and his descendants, paying an annual tribute, held it for many years. Even after the battle of T\u00e1l\u00edkot, when Bellary had passed under the rule of the Muhammadan dynasty of Bijapur, they continued in semi-independent possession. In 1650, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bellary defeated the descendant of the Vijayanagar R\u00e1j\u00e1s, who had claimed tribute from him, and for a century the feud continued between the two families. But the District then passed, with its neighbours, into the hands of the Niz\u00e1m; and Bellary was given as part of the estate of Adoni to Bas\u00e1lat Jang, the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s brother. Being called upon for tribute, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 rashly appealed for help to Haidar Ali, who at once advanced upon the place by forced marches, defeated the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s troops in a battle at the foot of the rock, and seized the fort for himself. The present fortifications were built by a staff of French engineers\u2014tradition adding that, after the new citadel had been completed, Haidar Ali hanged the French engineers at the gate, as he found that his fort could be commanded by a neighbouring rock higher than the site selected. Till 1792, Tipu Sult\u00e1n remained in possession, but in that year his stronghold fell by the partition treaty to the Niz\u00e1m, by whom it was ceded in 1800 to the British Government.\n\n**Bell\u00e1vi.** \u2014 Village in Tumk\u00far District, Mysore State. Lat. $13^\\circ 25'$ N., long. $77^\\circ 5'$ E.; population (1881) 1263. The streets are wide, with uniformly built shops. At the fair held weekly on Monday, trade is carried on to the value of \u00a32000. Great mart for export products.\n\n**Belo.** \u2014 Village in the t\u00e1luk of Suj\u00e1wal, Kar\u00e1chi (Kurrachee) District, Sind, Bombay Presidency.

Distant $32\\frac{3}{4}$ miles from Mughalbin, and $10\\frac{1}{2}$ miles from Dero. Police station, dharms\u00e1la for travellers, and post-office. The Hindu population consists chiefly of Loh\u00e1nos and Bh\u00e1tias; and the Muhammadan population of Sayyids and Muh\u00e1nas.\nBelona.\u2014Town in Katol tahsil, N\u00e1gpur District, Central Provinces; situated on the banks of a small tributary of the Wardh\u00e1, 4 miles north-west of Mowar town. Population (1881) 3269, namely, Hindus, 3189; Muhammadans, 38; Jains, 25; aboriginal tribes, 17. A purely agricultural town, with a school and market place.\n\nBelsand Kalan.\u2014Village in Muzaffarpur District, Bengal; situated on the east bank of the old B\u00e1ghmati river, about 27 miles from Muzaffarpur on the Kant\u00e1i and Sit\u00e1marhi road, and 13 miles from S\u00edt\u00e1marhi town.

Indigo factory, primary vernacular school, and police station.\n\nBel\u00far.\u2014T\u00e1luk in Hassan District, Mysore State. Area, 236 square miles. Land revenue, exclusive of water rates, (1881-82) \u00a39402.\n\nBel\u00far.\u2014Village in Hassan District, Mysore State; on the right bank of Yag\u00e1chi river; 23 miles by road north-west of Hassan. Lat. 13\u00b0 9' 45\" N., long. 75\u00b0 54' 40\" E.; population (1881) 2917. An ancient city, known in the Pur\u00e1na and on inscriptions as Velapura, and locally regarded as the Dakshina V\u00e1r\u00e1n\u00e1si or Southern Benares. It owes its sanctity to the celebrated temple of Chenna Kesava, adorned with carvings and sculptures from the master hand of Jakan\u00e1charjya. This building was erected and endowed by a king of the Hoysala Ball\u00e1la dynasty, on the occasion of his conversion from the Jain faith to the worship of Vishnu, about the middle of the 12th century. The annual festival, held for five days in April, is attended by 5000 persons. Headquarters of t\u00e1luk of the same name.\n\nBen.\u2014A sluggish stream in Hoshi\u00e1rpur and Jalandhar (Jullundur) Districts, Punjab. Known as the East or White (Saf\u00e9d) Ben, to distinguish it from another stream of the same name in K\u00e1p\u00farth\u00e1la territory. Formed by the confluence of torrents from the Siw\u00e1lik Hills; skirts for 35 miles the boundary between Hoshi\u00e1rpur and Jalandhar, during which it receives at right angles numerous affluents from the hills to the north-east; turns westward near the town of Malakpur; follows a serpentine course through the plain, and falls into the Sutlej (Satlaj) 4 miles above its junction with the (Beas) Bi\u00e1s. Crossed by bridge on Grand Trunk Road 3 miles from Jalandhar cantonment; fordable in cold weather. Banks too steep to admit of irrigation by overflow, but watering is practised by means of Persian wheels. The West or Black (S\u00edyah) Ben also rises in the Siw\u00e1liks, in Pargan\u00e1 Dasurya, runs through Hoshi\u00e1rpur and the K\u00e1p\u00farth\u00e1la State, and falls into the Beas 10 miles above its junction with the Sutlej. Bridge on Grand Trunk Road beyond Di\u00e1lpur in K\u00e1p\u00farth\u00e1la.\n\nBen.\u2014Small stream in Gurd\u00e1spur District, Punjab, formed by the junction of several brooks enclosing the town of Sukhuchak. Passes to east of Shakargarh, crosses roads from Gurd\u00e1spur to Shakargarh and\nSi\u00e1lkot, and falls into the R\u00e1vi almost opposite Dera N\u00e1nak. Length about 25 miles. Slender thread of water in dry weather; large volume during rains. Much used for purposes of irrigation.\n\n**Benares (Ban\u00e1ras).**\u2014A Division under a Commissioner in the North-Western Provinces, comprising the seven Districts of Azamgarh, Mirzapur, Benares, Ghazipur, Gorakhpur, Basti, and Ballia, each of which see separately; lying between $23^\\circ 52' 15''$ and $27^\\circ 30' N.$ lat., and between $82^\\circ 9' 45''$ and $84^\\circ 40' 15''$ E. long.; area, 18,337 square miles; population (1881) 9,820,728, namely, Hindus, 8,759,446; Muhammadans, 1,056,351; Sikhs, 432; Jains, 207; Brahmos, 2; Christians, 4,237; Jews, 50; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 3. Number of villages, 29,694; occupied houses, 1,544,433; average density of population, 535 per square mile; villages per square mile, 1.62; houses per square mile, 8.42; persons per house, 6.3. Of high-caste Hindus, Br\u00e1hmans number 976,718, or 11.15 per cent., and R\u00e1jputs 590,440, or 6.74 per cent. of the Hindu population. The K\u00e1yasths or writer caste are returned at 134,755; and the Baniy\u00e1s, or traders, at 211,478. The Bhars, the ancient dominant race in the North-Western Provinces, previous to R\u00e1jput and Muhammadan ascendancy, but now a crushed and depressed remnant of labourers and poor cultivators, are nearly all found in the Benares Division, where they number 301,518, out of a provincial total of 349,113. The other Hindu castes numbering over 50,000, are\u2014Cham\u00e1rs, the most numerous caste in the Division, 1,268,993, or 14.49 per cent. of the Hindu population; Ah\u00edrs, 1,176,593, or 13.43 per cent.; K\u00e1chhis, 423,743; K\u00farm\u00eds, 428,626; K\u00e1h\u00e1rs, 345,195; Mallahs, 343,321; Tel\u00eds, 219,023; Loni\u00e1s, 211,061; Bhuinh\u00e1rs, 188,003; Loh\u00e1rs, 177,920; Kumbh\u00e1rs, 166,025; Kalwars, 122,649; Na\u00eds, 114,810; Dhob\u00eds, 113,869; P\u00e1s\u00eds, 112,628; Gadariy\u00e1s, 81,875; Tambul\u00eds, 80,454; Kor\u00eds, 73,750; Barhais, 66,685; and Son\u00e1rs, 61,143. Of the Muhammadan population, 1,034,949 were returned by sect as Sunnis, and 21,402 as Shi\u00e1s. By race, the Muhammadans include 8501 R\u00e1jputs, 421 G\u00fajars, 1 J\u00e1t, and 25 Mew\u00e1tis. The Christian community consist of 1525 Europeans, 506 Eurasiens, 1 Armenian, and 2205 native converts. The Division contains 45 towns with upwards of 5000 inhabitants, the total urban population being 693,071, against 9,127,657 forming the rural population. Of the 29,694 villages and towns, no less than 15,316 contain less than two hundred inhabitants; 9586 from two to five hundred; 3386 from five hundred to a thousand; 1089 from one to two thousand; 187 from two to three thousand; and 85 from three to five thousand; the remainder being towns of over five thousand inhabitants. As regards occupation, the Census Report classifies the male population into the following six main groups:\u2014(1) Professional class, including civil and military officers, Government officials, and the learned professions, 53,636;\n(2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, etc., 16,952;\n(3) commercial class, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 79,377;\n(4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 2,415,155;\n(5) industrial class, including manufacturers and artisans, 347,861;\n(6) indefinite and non-productive class, including general labourers,\nmale children, and unspecified, 2,009,632. The total male adult\nagricultural population is returned at 2,402,483, cultivating an average\narea of 2'67 acres each. The entire agricultural population, however,\nwholly dependent on the soil, amounts to 7,515,510, or 76'53 per cent.\nof the Divisional population. Of the total area of 18,337 square miles,\n15,543 square miles are assessed for the payment of Government\nrevenue, of which 9569 square miles are actually under cultivation,\n2520 square miles cultivable, and the remainder uncultivable waste.\nTotal Government assessment, including local rates and cesses levied\non land, \u00a3970,192, or an average of 3s. 1\u00bdd. per cultivated acre; total\namount of rent, including cesses, \u00a32,020,810, or an average of 6s. 3\u00bdd.\nper cultivated acre. The administrative staff, with the Commissioner\nof the Division at its head, consists of 94 civil and revenue judges of\nall sorts, and 101 magistrates; strength of regular police, 5096 men,\nbesides a large body of village watchmen, maintained by the landholders\nand cultivators, either by money payments or rent-free grants of land.\nGross imperial revenue, \u00a31,064,333; cost of officials and police,\n\u00a3133,400.\n\nBenares.\u2014District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the North-\nWestern Provinces, lying between 25\u00b0 8' 30\" and 25\u00b0 32' 30\" N. lat.,\nand between 82\u00b0 42' and 83\u00b0 35' 30\" E. long.; area, 998 square\nmiles; population (1881) 892,694 souls. Benares is a District in the\nDivision of the same name, and is bounded on the north by Gh\u00e1zipur\nand Jaunpur; on the west and south by M\u00edrzapur; and on the east by\nSh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d in Bengal. The administrative head-quarters are at the city\nof Benares.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District of Benares forms part of the alluvial\nvalley deposited by the river Ganges, and occupies an irregular\nparallelogram on either bank of the sacred stream. The surface\nconsists of a level plain, with a gentle upward slope on each side from\nthe central depression; and the general monotony of its cultivated\nfields is only broken by the ravines of two tiny streamlets\u2014the Barna\nin the west and the Nand in the north\u2014and by the deep gorges and\nprecipitous cliffs of the Karamn\u00e1sa on the south-eastern boundary.\nThe Ganges enters the District as a very large river, augmented at the\npoint of leaving Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d by the Jumna (Jamun\u00e1), and joined 16 miles\nbelow Benares city by the waters of the G\u00famti. Before reaching the\nconfines of Gh\u00e1zipur, it presents a magnificent expanse of 4 miles in\nbreadth during the rainy season. The G\u00famti also flows through the\nDistrict for a course of some 22 miles; while the Karamn\u00e1sa skirts the south-eastern border, a heavy stream after rains, but almost dry during the hot months, though subject, like other hill rivers, to sudden flushes, which produce considerable inundations. The only other permanent water-course is that of the Barna Nad\u00ed, whose bed would run dry in the cold weather were it not prevented by a dam thrown across the slender stream about a mile above its confluence with the Ganges. Three small marshy lakes, known as the B\u00e1ripur, Koth, and Kow\u00e1r jhils, occupy hollows in the northern plain. The District has no forests or other waste lands of any importance, every available acre having been long brought under cultivation, and planted with a rich luxuriance of cereals or sugar-cane; while tiny hamlets lie thickly scattered in every direction over the face of the country. A few patches of barren \u00fas\u00e1ir, or saline efflorescence, occur here and there among the uplands, but much less commonly than in the Districts farther west; while jungle is only to be found along the ravines of the minor rivers. Beasts of prey are consequently rare, but hares, squirrels, porcupines, and monkeys abound; and wild-fowl congregate in numbers on the lakes and rivers.\n\nHistory.\u2014Although the city of Benares, the metropolis of Hinduism, can trace its origin to the very earliest period of Aryan colonization in India, yet the District at large can scarcely be said to possess any separate history of its own until the middle of the 18th century. The antiquities and ancient annals of Benares city itself will be found under the proper heading. During the Musalm\u00e1n period, the District was ruled by the Naw\u00e1bs of Oudh, till ceded with Gh\u00e1zipur to the British in 1775. The ancestors of the present Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Benares had already risen to importance under the Oudh Wazirs. In 1737, Mansa R\u00e1m, the founder of the family greatness, acquired possession of a fortress in Jaunpur District, and next year obtained for his son, Balwant Singh, the title of R\u00e1j\u00e1, and the three sark\u00e1rs of Jaunpur, Chan\u00e1r, and Benares. Mansa R\u00e1m died in 1740; but R\u00e1j\u00e1 Balwant Singh successfully followed up his father's policy. Through a long course of years he endeavoured to make himself practically independent of the Waz\u00edr, his lord-paramount, by building or seizing a line of fortresses on a strong strategical basis south of the Ganges. Step by step he acquired new strips of territory, and strengthened each acquisition by fresh military works.\n\nIn 1763, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 joined the Emperor Sh\u00e1h Alam and the Waz\u00edr Shuj\u00e1-ud-daul\u00e1 in their invasion of Bengal. After the disastrous battle of Baxar, however, he went over to the English camp, and prudently sought the protection of the conquerors. By the agreement of 1764, Balwant Singh's estates were transferred from Oudh to the English; but the transfer was disapproved by the Court of Directors, and in\n1765 the Benares territory was restored to Oudh, the Waz\u00edr consenting to guarantee the R\u00e1j\u00e1 in the quiet enjoyment of his possessions. Balwant Singh died in 1770, and the Wazir endeavoured to use the opportunity thus afforded him of dispossessing his powerful vassals. The English, however, compelled him to recognise the succession of Chait Singh, an illegitimate son of the late R\u00e1j\u00e1. Five years later, the Waz\u00edr ceded the sovereignty of the Benares estate to the British, who confirmed Chait Singh in his holding by sanad, dated April 15, 1776.\n\nThe succeeding events are so generally known, and have been so acrimoniously discussed, that a very brief recapitulation will here suffice. In 1778, a tribute of 5 lakhhs was levied upon Chait Singh for the maintenance of a battalion of sip\u00e1h\u00eds; similar demands were made in 1779 and 1780. In the latter year, our power in India being then threatened with a simultaneous attack on the part of Haidar Ali, the Niz\u00e1m, and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, the Governor-General, Warren Hastings, called upon the R\u00e1j\u00e1 to furnish a cavalry contingent of 1500 men. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 returned evasive answers, but did not send a single trooper. For this conduct, the Governor-General determined to inflict upon him a fine of 50 lakhhs, or \u00a3500,000. In August 1781, Hastings arrived at Benares, and finding Chait Singh still insubordinate, gave orders that he should be arrested in his own house. A riot occurred, the little body of British troops was attacked and easily overcome, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 fled to one of his strongholds, and a general rising took place in the city. Hastings, shut up with his slender retinue in Benares, found himself in a most critical position, from which he only extricated himself by flight to Chan\u00e1r. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 remained in open rebellion till the end of September, when the British troops collected and dispersed his followers. The Governor-General then returned to Benares, deposed Chait Singh, and recognised his nephew Mah\u00edpn\u00e1r\u00e1yan as R\u00e1j\u00e1. Chait Singh retired to Gwalior, where he died in 1810. The criminal administration of the whole estate, and the civil administration of the city, were taken from the R\u00e1j\u00e1 and assumed by the English.\n\nMah\u00edpn\u00e1r\u00e1yan died in 1795, and was succeeded by his son, Ud\u00edt-n\u00e1r\u00e1yan. On the death of the latter, in 1835, his estates descended to his nephew, the present Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1, Iswari Pras\u00e1d N\u00e1r\u00e1yan. (See Benares Estate.) When Waz\u00edr Ali, Naw\u00e1b of Oudh, was deposed by the British in 1798, he received orders to live at Benares. In January 1799, he attacked Mr. Cherry, the Governor-General's agent, and murdered him, with two other officers. The magistrate, whom he proceeded to assail, defended himself in his house till the cavalry arrived from Bit\u00e1bar and rescued him. Waz\u00edr Ali escaped at the time, but was given up and confined for life in Calcutta.\n\nFrom this period, English rule was never seriously disturbed till the Mutiny of 1857. News of the outbreak at Meerut reached Benares\non the 15th of May. The 37th Native Infantry at once became disorderly, and it was determined to disarm them on the 1st of June. They replied to the order with a volley, but when it was returned they shortly dispersed. The Sikhs and Irregular Cavalry joined the mutineers. The civil officers, however, held the Mint and the treasury, and the rebellion went no further. Parties of Europeans passing up from Calcutta to the north-west sufficed to keep the city quiet, though in the District some disturbances took place, and Mr. Moore, the Joint Collector, was murdered at Gop\u00eeganj in M\u00eerz\u00e2pur District. Early in June, the R\u00e1jputs of Jaunpur marched to attack Benares, but on the 17th they were cut to pieces by an English force. Next day the erection of the fort at R\u00e1jgh\u00e1t was commenced, on a site which commands the whole city, and no breach of the peace afterwards occurred.\n\n**Population.**\u2014Benares is by far the most thickly populated District in the North-Western Provinces, having a density of 894 persons to the square mile; while Ballia, which ranks next, has 808; Jaunpur, 778; Azamgarh, 747, and Gh\u00e1zipur, 688. The population, which in 1872 numbered 794,039, had increased to 892,684 in 1881, or by 11\u00b705 per cent. The Census of 1881, taken over an area of 998 square miles, disclosed the following results:\u2014Total population, 892,684; number of villages, 1946; number of occupied houses, 111,563; persons per square mile, 894; villages per square mile, 1\u00b79; houses per square mile, 111\u00b77; persons per village, 459; persons per house, 8. Classified according to sex, there were\u2014males, 450,784; females, 441,900; proportion of males, 50\u00b75 per cent. As regards the religious distinctions of the people, Hindus numbered 801,556; Musalm\u00e1ns, 89,351; Christians, 1768; Jains, 7; and P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 2. These figures show 90 per cent. of Hindus as against 10 per cent. of Muhammadans. The principal castes were represented as follows:\u2014Br\u00e1hmans, 104,092; R\u00e1jputs, 53,930; Baniy\u00e1s, 18,353; Ah\u00edrs, 80,088; Bhars, 36,407; Bhuinhars, 19,422; Cham\u00e1rs, 101,091; Gadari\u00e1s, 12,510; K\u00e1chhis, 41,834; Kah\u00e1rs, 28,376; Kalw\u00e1rs, 17,696; K\u00e1yasths, 15,548; Kumbhars, 15,237; K\u00farm\u00eds, 29,849; Loh\u00e1rs, 20,994; Loni\u00e1s, 15,136; Mallahs, 9870; Nais, 10,314; P\u00e1s\u00eds, 5164; Son\u00e1rs, 7714; Tambulis, 5581; and Tel\u00eds, 19,728. The District contains only two towns with a population exceeding 5000 souls\u2014namely, Benares city, 193,025, and R\u00e1mnagar, 11,859. Except these two, the latter of which is rather a suburb than a separate town, there is no place of any importance in the District, and the dense population lives in small scattered hamlets, thickly and evenly dotted over the Gangetic plain. This condition well illustrates the difference between the Do\u00e1b and the eastern basin of the great river. The upper tract of country has its inhabitants collected together in considerable towns, once walled\nand fortified, which afforded them protection in the days of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 or Afgh\u00e1n incursions; while in the more peaceful lower region the population is equally distributed over the cultivated soil, only a small fraction being gathered together in large cities. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Benares has a palace at R\u00e1mnagar, 2 miles above Benares, on the opposite or southern side. Colossal Buddhist remains exist at Sarnath.\n\nThe 1946 villages and towns are thus returned in point of population:\u2014859 contain less than two hundred inhabitants; 665 from two to five hundred; 324 from five hundred to a thousand; 82 from one to two thousand; 10 from two to three thousand; 4 from three to five thousand; 1 from ten to fifteen thousand; and 1 upwards of a hundred thousand inhabitants. As regards occupation, the male population is grouped by the Census Report of 1881 into the following six main classes:\u2014(1) Professional class, including civil and military officers, Government servants, and the learned professions, 12,536; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, etc., 4174; (3) commercial class, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 12,220; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 145,247; (5) industrial class, including manufacturers and artisans, 60,899; (6) indefinite and non-productive (consisting of 36,390 general labourers and 179,319 male children and unspecified), 215,709.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Benares District has the smallest area of any in the North-Western Provinces proper, except the Tar\u00e1i; its total extent being returned in 1881 at 998 square miles, of which 741 are cultivated, and only 69\u00b76 returned as still available for cultivation. Most of the soil consists of a rich clay, more or less mixed with sand, and usually very fertile. The course of tillage is that common to the whole upper basin of the Ganges. The khar\u00edf or autumn crops are sown after the first rain in June, and harvested in October and November. Rice may even be gathered in August, but cotton does not ripen for picking till February. B\u00e1jr\u00e1, jod\u00edr, and other common food-grains form the remaining staples of this harvest. The rabi or spring crops are sown in October or November, and reaped in March or April. They consist of wheat, barley, oats, peas, and other pulses. The harvests are a little earlier in Benares than in the Do\u00e1b and Rohilkhand Districts, owing to the dampness and comparative warmth of the winter, and the early commencement of the rainy season. The chief crops of the District comprise sugar-cane, Indian corn, barley, wheat, peas, indigo, and rice. Moth and p\u00e1t-san (hemp) are sown with other crops, but not separately. Manure is employed, where obtainable, for both crops, and land lies fallow whenever the cultivator can afford it. The same field is seldom planted for two harvests within a single year, the chief exception being in the case of rice lands, which often bear a\nsecond crop of some other staple. Where small proprietors own the soil, each holder generally tills his own plot in person; but, as a rule, the greater portion is let out to cultivating tenants. The whole District is permanently settled, and the landlords are therefore unusually powerful and wealthy. They can raise their rents without restriction, and the number of tenants-at-will increases daily, as the older occupancy-holders die out for want of heirs, or lose their privileges from inability to pay the rent. The total male adult agricultural population is returned at 141,790, cultivating an average area of 3.98 acres each. The total agricultural population, however, wholly dependent on the soil, numbers 439,605, or 49.25 per cent. of the District population. Of the total area of 998 square miles, 971 square miles are assessed for Government revenue, and of which 723 square miles are cultivated: 66 square miles still available for cultivation; and 182 square miles uncultivable and waste. Total Government assessment, including local rates and cesses on land, \u00a3104,739, or an average of 4s. 6\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. Total rental actually paid by cultivators, \u00a3169,499, or an average of 7s. 1\u00bcd. per cultivated acre. In the city of Benares, owing to the wealth of its rich traders and bankers, and the constant influx of opulent pilgrims, the standard of living ranks decidedly higher than elsewhere in the North-Western Provinces; and the presence of a large Bengali element, bringing with it the habits and ideas of comfort which prevail in Calcutta, does much to keep up the tendency in that direction. But the crowded peasantry of the country parganas live in extreme poverty, and have little or nothing upon which they can fall back in seasons of distress. Wages and prices have risen of late years. Coolies and unskilled labourers now receive from 2\u00bdd. to 3\u00bdd. per diem; agricultural labourers, 2\u00bdd. to 3d. per diem; bricklayers and carpenters, 6d. to 2s. per diem. Women obtain about one-fifth less than men, while children are paid from one-half to one-third the wages of adults. The following were the average prices-current of food-grains in 1876:\n\n- Wheat, 21 sers per rupee, or 5s. 4d. per cwt.; best rice, 13 sers per rupee, or 8s. 7d. per cwt.; jo\u00e1r, 30 sers per rupee, or 3s. 9d. per cwt.; bajr\u00e1, 29 sers per rupee, or 3s. 10d. per cwt.\n\nIn 1882, wheat was 16\u00bd sers per rupee, or 6s. 9\u00bdd. per cwt.; best rice, 12\u00bd sers per rupee, or 8s. 11\u00bdd. per cwt.; jo\u00e1r, 29\u00bd sers per rupee, or 3s. 9\u00bdd. per cwt.; and bajr\u00e1, 28 sers per rupee, or 4s. per cwt.\n\n**Natural Calamities.**\u2014Although Benares District suffers like its neighbours from drought, and from its natural consequence, famine, yet it appears to occupy an intermediate position between the centres of distress in Upper India and Bengal, so as to be less severely affected by scarcity than either of the regions to the east and west. In 1770, Benares was visited by famine in common with all the other Districts east of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, including those of Behar. In 1783, the dearth\npressed chiefly upon the western country; but Benares suffered somewhat, like all the tract to the west of the Karamn\u00e1sa, and grain riots occurred in the city. In 1803, it became necessary to offer a bounty of 15 rupees (\u00a31, 10s.) on every 100 maunds of grain (about $3\\frac{1}{2}$ tons) imported from Bengal into Benares or Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d; yet the scarcity was not so severe as in Rohilkhand and the west. The great famine of 1837\u201338, which ravaged the whole North-Western Provinces, fell upon Benares with great severity, though less fiercely than in the Do\u00e1b. The dearth of 1860\u201361, which proved so fatal in the Upper Do\u00e1b and the Agra Division, did not reach Benares; while the Bengal famine of 1874 hardly touched the confines of the District.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The commerce of the District centres almost entirely in the city (q.v.). A considerable trade passes through from Jaunpur, Azamgarh, Gorakhpur, and Basti. Two lines of railroad traverse the District throughout the greater portion of its length. The East Indian Railway runs through the pargan\u00e1s south of the Ganges, with stations at Sakaldiha and Mughal Sar\u00e1i; and sends off a branch line, 6 miles in length, which ends on the river bank just opposite Benares. The Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway has its terminus at Benares, on the north bank of the Ganges, and runs north-west for 20 miles in this District, with stations at Seopur, B\u00e1batpur, and Ph\u00falpur. The Grand Trunk Road from Calcutta to Delhi also traverses the District from end to end, with a length of 44 miles, crossing the Ganges at Benares by a bridge of boats. Other good roads connect the city with Jaunpur, Ahaura, Sakaldiha, and Gh\u00e1z\u00edpur. The total length of made roads in the District in 1881 was 568$\\frac{1}{2}$ miles.\n\nAdministration.\u2014Benares is the head-quarters of a Commissioner, and the seat of a civil and session judgeship, which does not include any other District. The Commissioner of Benares is also agent for the Viceroy in his official relations with the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Benares, and ex officio superintendent of the Benares Family Domains. The ordinary administrative staff of the District includes a Collector-Magistrate, 1 Joint Magistrate, 1 Assistant, and 2 Deputies, besides the usual medical, fiscal, and constabulary establishment. The whole amount of revenue, imperial, municipal, and local, raised in the District in 1880, amounted to \u00a3172,950; and in 1880\u201381 the imperial revenue was returned at \u00a3139,308, of which \u00a389,480 was derived from the land. The District regular police force had a total strength, in 1880, of 553 men, besides a municipal and cantonment police of 453, maintained at a cost of \u00a311,211, of which \u00a37411 was contributed from provincial and \u00a33800 from local funds; being at the rate of 1 policeman to every square mile and to every 903 persons of the population. Benares possesses two places of confinement\u2014the central prison and the District jail. The former contained in 1880 a daily average number of\n1546 criminals, of whom 174 were females; but these were recruited from all the Districts composing the Benares Division. The District jail and lock-up included, during the same year, a daily average of 553 prisoners, of whom 550 were males and 3 females. The postal establishment comprises 16 imperial and 2 provincial post-offices, and the telegraph is in operation at all the stations on both railways, as well as in the city.\n\nThe total number of schools receiving State aid or under inspection by the Education Department, in 1881-82, was 144, attended by 7190 pupils. There are also several unaided and uninspected schools in the District, regarding which no statistics are available. The Census Report of 1881 returns 9808 boys as being under instruction, and 37,635 other males as able to read and write, but not under instruction. These figures, however, must not be accepted as accurate, and are probably considerably below the mark. For fiscal and administrative purposes the District is divided into 2 tahsils and 19 parganas. The only municipality is that of Benares, which had an income, in 1880-81, of \u00a31749, or 1s. 2\u00bdd. per head of municipal population.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Benares is one of the hottest and dampest in the North-Western Provinces. No really cold weather diversifies the year as in the upper country beyond Allahabad; and since the hot west winds have lost their force before reaching this District, tattis or grass mats fail to perform their function of cooling the air by evaporation. The temperature more nearly resembles that of Lower Bengal than that of the North-Western plains in general. The average mean monthly thermometrical readings for a period of 13 years, ending in 1880, are returned as follows:\u2014January 60\u00b01\u00b0 F., February 66\u00b05\u00b0, March 76\u00b09\u00b0, April 86\u00b07\u00b0, May 91\u00b06\u00b0, June 91\u00b06\u00b0, July 85\u00b01\u00b0, August 84\u00b05\u00b0, September 83\u00b05\u00b0, October 78\u00b05\u00b0, November 68\u00b09\u00b0, December 60\u00b04\u00b0. Yearly average, 77\u00b08\u00b0. In 1880-81, the highest maximum temperature was 111\u00b03\u00b0 in June, and the lowest minimum 38\u00b05\u00b0 in January, the annual mean being 78\u00b05\u00b0. The average total rainfall for about 30 years ending 1881 was 39\u00b086 inches; the maximum during this period being 57\u00b07 inches in 1861-62, and the minimum 21\u00b06 inches in 1860-61. The rainfall in 1880 was only 26\u00b036 inches, or 13\u00b050 inches below the average. The total number of deaths recorded in the year 1880 was 22,479, or 25\u00b02 per 1000 of the population. The District contains 5 charitable dispensaries\u20144 in the city and suburbs, and 1 at Chandauli, on the south bank. In 1881 they afforded relief to a total of 57,678 persons.

Lat. 25\u00b0 18' 31\" N., long. 83\u00b0 3' 4\" E. The city, exclusive of the cantonments, covers an area of 3448 acres, and contained in 1881 a population of 193,025, namely, Hindus, 147,230; Muhammadans, 45,529; and Christians, 266. The cantonment population of 6675 consists of 4104 Hindus, 1705 Muhammadans, 864 Christians, and 2 'others.' Benares, the religious metropolis of the Hindu faith, and first city of the North-Western Provinces (exclusive of Oudh) in population and importance, lies on the left or northern bank of the river Ganges, about 120 miles below its junction with the Jumna, at an elevation of 253 feet above sea level; distant from Calcutta 421 miles north-west, from Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d 74 miles east, and from Delhi 466 miles south-east. The Ganges forms a bay or crescent-shaped reach in front of the city, thus permitting the eye to take in at a single sweep the long line of its picturesque gh\u00e1ts and splendid temples. The town is built of Chan\u00e1r freestone, and consists of winding labyrinths and narrow alleys, lined by temples, mosques, or palaces, and crowded with pilgrims and busy citizens, camels, asses, horses, and sacred bulls. But though the view is everywhere obstructed within the city itself, along the bank of the Ganges is unrolled a magnificent panorama of palaces, capped by domes, minarets, and sacred buildings, in every variety of oriental architecture. The people spend a large part of their time praying, bathing, or lounging by the water-side. The gh\u00e1ts are crowded with fak\u00edrs and other ashbesprinkled and almost naked ascetics, practising their devotions and life-long austerities. The city can be approached either by land or water. The Ganges affords a navigable highway for large steamships; the East Indian Railway has a station opposite R\u00e1jgh\u00e1t. A bridge of boats is maintained here during the hot and dry seasons by the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway Company, who have a temporary line of railway from Benares cantonment to R\u00e1jgh\u00e1t. A ferry is kept up during the rains. Benares is at present the terminus of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway, but a bridge across the Ganges at R\u00e1jgh\u00e1t, close to the bridge of boats, is now (1883) in course of construction, and the line will then run across the river to Mughal Sar\u00e1i, and there join the East Indian Railway. The Grand Trunk Road and other good metalled ways lead over bridges on the Ganges or the Barna from every quarter. No walls or fortifications enclose the holy city. During the Mutiny, a fort erected at R\u00e1jgh\u00e1t overawed the disaffected section of the populace; but this has now been abandoned, owing to alleged\nunhealthiness, though its position on an eminence commanding the passage of the river makes it the natural key of Benares and the surrounding country.\n\nHistory.\u2014From the earliest period of Aryan colonization in India, a city appears to have existed at the junction of the Barna with the Ganges. The name of V\u00e1r\u00e1nas\u00ed, converted into Ban\u00e1ras by transposition of the liquid consonants, frequently occurs in early Sanskrit literature. In the sixth century B.C., Gautama Buddha, on the eve of promulgating his new religion, fixed upon Benares as the first station for preaching the doctrine of nirv\u00e1na, and took up his residence at Sarnath. Even before that time, Benares had apparently acquired a reputation as the most sacred city of the Hindu creed; it then became, for 800 years, the head-quarters of Buddhism; and about the 4th century after Christ it once more reverted to the ancient faith, whose metropolis it remains to the present day. Hwen Thsang, the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim of the 7th century, found the kingdom of Benares divided between the two creeds. He mentions the existence of 30 Buddhist monasteries and 100 Hindu temples. Sankar Ach\u00e1rjya, the great opponent of Buddhism and champion of the Sivaite sect, lived in Benares in the 7th century. After the annihilation of the rival faith in Upper India, the Sivaite Hindus rebuilt a considerable portion of the city, changing its site from the northern bank of the Barna to its present position on the angle enclosed between the southern shore and the Ganges.\n\nBenares has shown a tendency to shift its position in different directions from the most ancient times. The oldest town occupied the site of S\u00e1r\u0144\u00e1th, where colossal Buddhist remains still lie thickly scattered over the ground. At a later period, the centre of the city stood apparently north of the Barna. Mausoleums, mosques, dargahs, and Hindu temples, now in ruins, stud the vacant space to the north of the present city; thus showing that up till the Muhammadan period Benares lay close to the south bank of the Barna; while the modern frontage faces the Ganges alone, leaving an empty suburb to the north-east. Most of the existing buildings date no further back than the reign of Akbar. Muhammad Ghori took Benares in 1194 A.D., and the various Musalm\u00e1n dynasties continued to hold it for 600 years. Nearly all the edifices in the city which can lay claim to any antiquity have been appropriated to Muhammadan purposes. The Musalm\u00e1ns converted all the larger temples into mosques or tombs, and destroyed or mutilated the remainder, using their walls as quarries for building material. Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn boasted that he had razed to the ground 1000 shrines in Benares alone. The existing Hindu buildings are generally small, and often destitute of architectural merit or ornamental detail, owing apparently to the stringency of the Muhammadan rule.\nDuring the 18th century, Benares fell into the hands of the Oudh Wazirs, under whom a family of local R\u00e1j\u00e1s established their power in the surrounding country. The story of their rise to authority, the rebellion and deposition of Chait Singh, and the subsequent fortunes of their house, belong rather to the wider history of Benares District than to the special annals of the city. Benares was ceded to the British, with the remainder of Chait Singh\u2019s domain, in 1775, and a Resident was appointed to watch the interests of the new Government. Waz\u00edr Al\u00ed of Oudh, after his deposition, was compelled to live at Benares; and in 1799 he attacked and murdered Mr. Cherry, the Resident, with two other officers. The Waz\u00edr escaped for the time, but was afterwards captured and deported to Calcutta. During the Mutiny of 1857 a serious outbreak took place at Benares. On receipt of the news from Meerut, the 37th Native Infantry became mutinous, and resisted an order to disarm. The Sikhs and Irregular Cavalry joined the mutineers; but the whole body dispersed after being fired upon. The Europeans then fortified the Mint, in which the civil officers took up their abode. The frequent passage of troops from Calcutta westwards proved sufficient to overawe the mob of the city.\n\nGeneral Appearance, Architecture, etc.\u2014Benares, or K\u00e1si, lies on the west bank of the Ganges, which flows nearly north and south as it passes before the city. The native town skirts the sacred river, with a constant succession of stone steps and ornamental fa\u00e7ades. West of this crowded labyrinth stands the suburb of S\u00edghra, the seat of the chief missionary institutions. Northward, towards the Barna, the Sikraul cantonments and parade ground stretch away to the bank of the smaller stream, which is here crossed by two bridges of stone and iron respectively. South of the Barna lie the church, post-office, and court-house; the civil station occupies the northern bank, while beyond comes a vacant cantonment, formerly used by European cavalry. Along the edge of the Ganges a precipitous cliff rises to a height of 100 feet, and numerous gh\u00e1ts or bathing stairs descend by long flights from this elevation to the level of the stream below. At intervals a handsome shrine or picturesque temple, built close to the water\u2019s edge, breaks their line. The buildings on the edge of the cliff, being for the most part five or six storeys high, crowned with pinnacles or towers, add to the impressive effect.\n\nWithin the city, the streets contain many handsome houses, substantially built and elaborately decorated; but their narrow, dirty, and crowded state usually disappoints the visitor, after the high expectations aroused by the view from the river. The upper storeys often project beyond the lower floor, and small bridges thrown across the roadway occasionally connect the houses on opposite sides of the street. To prevent inspection from the neighbouring fronts, the\nwindows have been made extremely small. The fa\u00e7ades are often painted in fantastic patterns, to represent the mythical episodes of Hindu theology. During the fine season most of the inhabitants sleep on the roofs of their houses. The town bristles with religious buildings, Hindu and Muhammadan. The temples of the ancient faith are set down at 1454, most of which are diminutive shrines, while the Musalm\u00e1ns possess 272 mosques. Besides these regular places of worship, every niche, corner, and empty space upon the gh\u00e1ts and in the walls of houses is occupied by some religious image, mutilated statue, linga, or square-hewn sacred stone. R\u00e1j\u00e1 M\u00e1n Singh of Jaipur is said to have presented 100,000 temples to the city in a single day. The chief buildings are too numerous to be fully noticed, but a few among them deserve special attention.\n\nThe temple at Durg\u00e1 Kund, in the southern extremity of the city, has a great society of sacred monkeys attached to its precincts. It was erected by R\u00e1ni Bhaw\u00e1n\u00ed during the last century, and is remarkable for its simple and graceful architecture. The Das\u00e1samedh gh\u00e1t forms one of the five sacred places of pilgrimage in Benares. R\u00e1j\u00e1 Jai Singh\u2019s observatory, a handsome and substantial building, erected in 1693, overlooks the M\u00e1n Mandil gh\u00e1t. Its founder reformed the calendar for the Emperor Muhammad Sh\u00e1h. Close to the same spot stands the Nep\u00e1lese temple, whose quaint and picturesque architecture unexpectedly betrays the influence of Chinese models. Surrounded by pure Hindu buildings, it strikes the eye at once alike by its novelty and by its excellent workmanship. A little above the observatory, the burning gh\u00e1t, where the bodies of Hindus are reduced to ashes, leads down to the Ganges by a narrow, confined pathway, with numerous slabs of stone set up on end in honour of widows who have performed sati. The Well of Mani Karniki, filled with the sweat of Vishnu, forms one of the chief attractions for pilgrims, thousands of whom annually bathe in its fetid waters. Stone steps lead down to the edge, crowded with worshippers, whose sins are washed away by the efficacious spring. The graceful T\u00e1rakeswar shrine fronts the well.\n\nThe huge mass of Aurangzeb\u2019s mosque, built from the remains of a Hindu temple, towers conspicuously over the brink of a steep cliff, above the P\u00e1nchgang\u00e1 gh\u00e1t, with strong breastworks of masonry extending far down the bank. It is the most conspicuous building in the city when seen from the river; and on a nearer view becomes remarkable for its slender minarets, 147 feet in height, and slightly inclined from the perpendicular. Bhairon\u00e1th, the divine guardian and watchman of Benares, has a famous temple near the public gardens; while his sacred baton or stone club, 4 feet in height, is deposited in a separate shrine hard by. Close to it is the Gop\u00e1l mandir, containing two gold images of Krishna. This temple, though not remarkable for beauty of architecture, ranks\nfirst in wealth and in the richness of its furniture and jewels. The temple is daily attended by numbers of devotees. But the Bisheswar or golden temple, dedicated to Siva, may perhaps be selected without invidiousness as the holiest among all the holy places of the sacred city. It stands a short distance from the observatory, and contains the venerated symbol of the god, a plain Linga of uncarved stone. Bisheswar rules Benares as spiritual monarch, under whom Bhairon\u00e1th acts merely as minister and magistrate. The building has a central spire, and each corner is crowned by a dome. The temple was erected by Ahalya Bai, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Princess of Indore. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Ranj\u00edt Singh of Lahore had the spire and domes covered with gold leaf, from which the temple derives its ordinary title. The Buddhist remains at Sarnath, about 4 miles from the city, will be described under their proper heading.\n\nThe most remarkable relic of early antiquity in Benares itself is the L\u00e1t Bhairo, a broken pillar, supposed to be a fragment of one among the many columns set up by the great Buddhist Emperor Asoka in the third century B.C. Many other fragmentary or mutilated monuments strew the ground outside the city, or form portions of Muhammadan edifices, into which they have been built as ready-made masonry. Few buildings of European origin deserve special mention. The most noteworthy is the Government college, a large structure in the perpendicular style, faced with Chan\u00e1r freestone. Next to it rank the Prince of Wales Hospital, built by the gentry of Benares in commemoration of the visit of His Royal Highness to the city in 1876; and the Town Hall, a fine building, constructed at the expense of the late Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Vizian\u00e1gram, where the special magistrates hold their courts, and where public and other important meetings are held.\n\nManufactures, Trade, etc.\u2014The wealth of Benares depends largely upon the constant influx of opulent pilgrims from every part of India, whose presence lends the same impetus to the local trade as that given to European watering-places by the season visitors. Many of the pilgrims are R\u00e1j\u00e1s or other persons of importance, who bring considerable retinues, and become large benefactors to the various shrines and temples. Hindu princes of distant States pride themselves upon keeping up a \u2018town residence\u2019 in holy K\u00e1si. But besides the wealth which thus flows passively into the b\u00e1z\u00e1rs of Benares, a considerable trade is carried on by the merchants and bankers. The sugar, indigo, and saltpetre of the District find a market in the city. The trans-Gogra products of Gorakhpur and Basti, and the raw materials of Jaunpur, form large items in the through traffic of Benares. Manchester goods are imported in considerable quantities, and distributed to the neighbouring local centres. The chief manufactures comprise silks and shawls, cloth embroidered in gold and silver thread, gold filagree\nwork, jewellery, enchased brass vessels, and lacquered wooden toys; the last two are largely exported to England. The principal institutions are\u2014the Queen's College, which has a roll of 700 students; the Normal School; missions in connection with the Church of England, the Baptist, and the London Missionary Societies; Jai N\u00e1r\u00e1yan's College; the Benares Institute, a society mainly composed of native gentlemen, and devoted to literature, science, and social progress; and the Carmichael Library, consisting of a large collection of English and Oriental standard works, periodicals, and library. In 1880-81, the municipal income of Benares amounted to \u00a317,495 (from octroi duties, \u00a313,432), or 1s. 2\u00bdd. per head of municipal population.\n\n**Benares.**\u2014Tahsil or Sub-division of Benares District, North-Western Provinces, comprising all the portion of the District lying north of the Ganges, and including the city of Benares.

The tahsil contained, in 1883, 4 civil and revenue and 13 criminal courts, with 15 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s); strength of regular police force, 643 men; village watchmen (chaukiddirs), 926.\n\n**Benares.**\u2014Estate, comprising the Family Domains of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Benares, consisting of the pargan\u00e1s of Kaswar R\u00e1j\u00e1 in Benares District and Gang\u00e1pur and Bhadoh\u00ed in Mirz\u00e1pur District. The average rental of the estate, which has an area of 985 square miles, somewhat exceeds \u00a380,000, of which nearly \u00a330,000 is paid as revenue to the British Government. The estate is in political relation with the Government of the North-Western Provinces; and the Family Domains have been specially exempted from the operation of Act xviii. of 1871 (an Act for the levy of land rates for local purposes, North-Western Provinces). The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1, His Highness Sr\u00ed Pras\u00e1d N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Singh Bah\u00e1dur, G.C.S.I., is a Gautam Br\u00e1hman of the Bhuinhar clan. He has received a sanad giving him rights of adoption, and is entitled to a salute of 13 guns. The family of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 lay claim to great antiquity; but the real founder was Mansa R\u00e1m, whose son, Balwant Singh, marched with the Mughal Emperor, Sh\u00e1h Alam, and the Naw\u00e1b of Oudh, Shuj\u00e1-ud-daul\u00e1, to expel the British from Bengal. In this expedition, Balwant Singh acted a prudent part, and awaited the result of the battle of Baxar, after which he joined the British camp; and the zamind\u00e1ri was finally transferred to the British Government in 1775, subject to a tribute, and on condition of his adopting measures for the preservation of the peace of the country. In 1778, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 was required to subsidize three battalions of Sepoys; and in 1780 he was also required to employ his cavalry for the general service of the State. R\u00e1j\u00e1 Chait Singh, son of Balwant Singh, manifested great\nreluctance to meet these demands, and was also believed to be dis-\naffected, and to hold correspondence with the enemies of the British\nGovernment. He was accordingly arrested by order of Warren\nHastings; but he escaped, collected troops, and headed a rebellion,\nwhich was crushed after a few petty skirmishes. Chait Singh was\ndeprived of his estate, which was given to his nephew, Mahip Singh,\ngrandson of Balwant Singh, subject to a tribute. The present Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1\nis a nephew of Mahip Singh\u2019s son, and succeeded in 1835.\n\n**Bendam\u00farlanka.**\u2014Town in God\u00e1var\u00ed District, Madras Presidency.\n\u2014See BANDAMURLANKA.\n\n**Bengal.**\u2014A Presidency of British India, comprising the whole river\nsystem of the Ganges and Brahmaputra, together with the upper waters\nof the Indus and its affluents; or, roughly speaking, all India north of\nthe Vindhya Mountains. The various significations which the term\n\u2018Bengal\u2019 has borne at different times will be explained in the following\narticle (BENGAL, LOWER). The Presidency of Bengal has now a\nhistorical rather than an administrative meaning, except in the Military\nDepartment, the Indian Army being still organised under three Com-\nmanders-in-Chief\u2014for Bengal, Madras, and Bombay respectively\u2014with\nthe supreme direction vested in the Commander-in-Chief for Bengal.\nThe Bengal Presidency includes the following five great Provinces,\neach presided over by a Local Government of its own, but all subject\nto the general control of the Government of India, with the Viceroy\nat its head. A full account of each of these Provinces will be found\nunder their respective names. The Central Provinces were formed\ninto a separate jurisdiction only in 1861, long after the term \u2018Bengal\nPresidency\u2019 had acquired its historical meaning. They are garrisoned\npartly from the Bengal Presidency, partly from that of Madras, and\nare not included in the following table.\n\n**The Bengal Presidency (1881).**\n\n(As returned in the Imperial Census Report, vol. ii.)\n\n| Name of Province                  | Area.

Excluding Assam, which was erected into a separate administration in February 1874, Bengal now includes the four great Provinces of Bengal Proper, Behar, Orissa, and Chhot\u00e1 or Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur. It forms a Lieutenant-Governorship, with a population, according to the Census of 1881, of 69,536,861 souls; and an area of 193,198 square miles, or 187,222 square miles, excluding rivers, lakes, and certain unsurveyed tracts. Although ruled by a Lieutenant-Governor, Bengal forms the largest Administrative Division of India. It contains, exclusive of Assam, one-third of the total population of British India, and yields a gross revenue of 17 to 18 millions sterling, or one-third of the actual revenues of the Indian Empire. It is bounded on the north by Nep\u00e1l and Bh\u00fat\u00e1n; on the east by Assam, and by an unexplored mountainous region which separates it from China and Northern Burma; on the south by the Bay of Bengal, Madras, and the Central Provinces; and on the west by the plateau of the Central India Agency, and by an imaginary line running between it and the adjoining Lieutenant-Governorship of the North-Western Provinces.\n\nThe word Bengal is derived from Sanskrit geography, and applies strictly to the country stretching south-east from Bh\u00e1galpur to the sea. The ancient Banga formed one of the five outlying kingdoms of Aryan India, and was practically conterminous with the Delta of Bengal. It derived its name, according to the etymology of the Pandits, from a prince of the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata, to whose portion it fell on the original partition of the country among the Lunar race of Delhi. But a city called Bang\u00e1l\u00e1, of which no trace remains, found its way into the old maps, near Chittagong, probably from the statements of Louis Varthema. It is pretty certain, however, that Varthema's travels never extended beyond the Malabar coast. The Arabs had a custom of applying the name of a country to its chief city, and it was probably in this way that Varthema and other early writers picked up the idea of a great town called Bengal.\n\nThe name Bang\u00e1l\u00e1 first came into use about the 13th century. It is used by Marco Polo (1250\u20131323); and by his contemporary Rashid-ud-din (1247\u20131318). Under Musalm\u00e1n rule, it applied specifically to the Gangetic delta, like the Banga of Sanskrit times, although the later Muhammadan conquests to the east of the Brahmaputra were eventually included within it. In their distribution of the country for fiscal purposes, it formed the central Province of a Governorship, including Behar on the north-west, and Orissa on the south-west, jointly ruled by one Deputy of the Delhi Emperor. Under the English, the\nname has at different periods borne very different significations. Francis Fernandez applies it to the country from the extreme east of Chittagong to Point Palmyras in Orissa, with a coast line which Purchas estimates at 600 miles, running inland for the same distance, and watered by the Ganges. This territory would include the Muhammadan Province of Bengal, with parts of Behar and Orissa. The loose idea thus derived from old voyagers became stereotyped in the archives of the East India Company. All its north-eastern factories, from Balasor, on the Orissa coast, to Patna, in the heart of Behar, belonged to the 'Bengal Establishment;' and as our conquests crept higher up the rivers, the term came to be applied to the whole of Northern India. But during the last forty years, the tendency to a greater exactitude in the civil administration has gradually brought about a corresponding precision in the use of Indian geographical names. The Upper Provinces date their separate existence from 1832. Since that year, they stand forward under a name of their own as the North-Western Provinces, in contradistinction to the Lower Provinces of Bengal. Later annexations have added new territorial entities, and the northern Presidency of Bengal is now mapped out into six separate Governments\u2014the Punjab, the North-Western Provinces with Oudh, the Central Provinces, Lower Bengal, Assam, and Ajmere.\n\nThree of the Provinces of the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal\u2014namely, Bengal Proper, Behar, and Orissa\u2014consist of great river valleys; the fourth, Chhot\u00e1 or Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, is a mountainous region, which separates them from the Central Indian plateau. Orissa comprises the rich deltas of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed and the neighbouring rivers, bounded by the Bay of Bengal on the south-east, and walled in on the north-west by Tributary Hill States. Proceeding eastward, the Province of Bengal Proper stretches along the coast from Orissa to British Burma, and inland from the seaboard to the Him\u00e1layas. Its southern portion is formed by the united deltas of the Ganges and Brahmaputra; its northern consists of the valleys of these great rivers and their tributaries. Behar lies on the north-west of Bengal Proper, and comprises the higher valley of the Ganges, from the spot where it issues south-eastwards from the territories of the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces. Between Behar and Orissa, but stretching farther westward, and deep into the hill country, lies the Province of Chhot\u00e1 or Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The territory, thus hemmed in, except at its north-western frontier, by the unchangeable landmarks of Nature\u2014the mountains and the sea\u2014consists chiefly of two broad river valleys. By the western one, the Ganges brings down the wealth and the accumulated waters of Northern India. The eastern valley forms the route by which the Brahmaputra, after draining the Tibetan plateau on\nthe north of the Him\u00e1layas, and skirting round their passes not far from the Yang-tse-Kiang and the great river of Cambodia, ends its tortuous journey of 1800 miles. The valleys of the Ganges and Brahmaputra in Bengal, although for the most part luxuriant alluvial plains, are diversified by spurs and peaks thrown out from the great mountain systems which wall them in on the north-east and south-west. This fertile region of hill and river produces tea, indigo, turmeric, the opium poppy, innumerable grains and pulses, pepper, ginger, betel-nut, the cinchona which yields quinine, many costly spices and drugs, oil-seeds of various kinds, cotton, the silk mulberry, inexhaustible crops of jute and other fibres; timber, from the feathery bamboo and coronetted palm to the iron-hearted sal tree\u2014in short, every vegetable product which feeds and clothes a people, and enables it to trade with foreign nations. Nor is the country destitute of mineral wealth. The Districts near the sea consist entirely of alluvial formations; and, indeed, it is stated that no substance so coarse as gravel occurs throughout the Delta, or in the heart of the Provinces within 300 miles of the river mouths. But amid the hilly spurs and undulations on either side, coal, and iron, and copper ores, hold out a new future to Bengal, as capital increases under the influence of a stable Government, and our knowledge of the country becomes more exact. The coal-fields on the west have for a century been worked by English enterprise, and now yield between half a million and a million tons per annum.\n\nIn the east, the coal-measures of Assam, which Province was separated from Bengal in 1874, await the general development of the country and improved facilities of transport. A railway has lately (1884) been opened to the most important of the Assam coal-fields. The climate varies from the snowy regions of the Him\u00e1layas to the tropical vapour-bath of the Delta and the burning winds of Behar. The ordinary range of the thermometer on the plains is from about $52^\\circ$ F. in the coldest month to $103^\\circ$ in the shade in summer. Anything below $60^\\circ$ is considered very cold; and by care in the hot weather, the temperature of well-built houses rarely exceeds $95^\\circ$. The rainfall also varies greatly\u2014from 500 to 600 inches per annum at Chara Punji (Cherra Poonjee), Assam, to an average of about 37 inches in Behar, and about 65 inches in the Delta. Further meteorological details will be found on pp. 321-2.\n\nThe Rivers.\u2014The most distinctive feature of Bengal is its rivers. These untaxed highways bring down, almost by the motive power of their own currents, the crops of Northern India to the seaboard\u2014an annual harvest of wealth to the trading classes, for which the population of the Lower Provinces neither toil nor spin. Lower Bengal, indeed, exhibits the two typical stages in the life of a great river. In the northern Districts, the rivers run along the valleys, receive the drainage from the country on either side, absorb broad tributaries, and rush forward with\nan ever-increasing volume. But near the centre of the Provinces they enter upon a new stage in their career. Their main channels bifurcate, and each new stream so created throws off its own set of distributaries to right and left. The country which they thus enclose and intersect forms the Delta of Bengal. Originally conquered by fluvial deposits from the sea, it now stretches out as a vast dead level, in which the rivers find their velocity checked. The diminished force of their currents ceases to carry along the silt which they have brought down from Northern India. The streams, accordingly, deposit their alluvial burden in their channels and upon their banks, so that by degrees their beds rise above the level of the surrounding country. In this way, the rivers in the Delta slowly build themselves up into high-level canals, which every autumn break through or overflow their margins, and leave their silt upon the adjacent flats. Thousands of square miles in Lower Bengal thus receive each year a top-dressing of virgin soil, brought free of expense from the Him\u00e1layas\u2014a system of natural manuring which defies the utmost power of over-cropping to exhaust its fertility. As the rivers creep farther down the Delta, they become more and more sluggish, and their bifurcations and interlacings more complicated. The last scene of all is a vast amphibious wilderness of swamp and forest, amid whose solitudes the network of channels insensibly merges into the sea. Here the perennial struggle between earth and ocean goes on, and all the ancient secrets of land-making stand disclosed. The rivers, finally checked by the dead weight of the sea, deposit their remaining silt, which emerges as banks or blunted promontories, or, after years of battling with the tide, adds a few feet or, it may be, a few inches to the foreshore.\n\nThe Ganges, which enters on the western frontier, and runs diagonally across Bengal, gives to the country its peculiar character and aspect. About 220 miles from its mouth, it spreads out into numerous branches, forming a Delta. The Delta, where it borders on the sea, becomes a labyrinth of creeks and rivers, running through the dense forests of the Sundarbans, and exhibiting during the annual inundation the appearance of an immense sea. Higher up, the rice-fields, to the extent of thousands of square miles, are submerged. The scene presents to a European eye a panorama of singular novelty and interest\u2014the crops covered with water; the ears of grain floating on the surface; the stupendous embankments, which restrain, without altogether preventing, the excesses of the inundations; and peasants in all quarters going about their daily work in canoes or on rafts. The navigable streams which fall into, or diverge from, the Ganges, intersect the country in every direction, and afford abundant facilities for internal communication. In many parts, boats can approach, by means of lakes, rivulets, and watercourses, to the door of almost every cottage. The\nlower region of the Ganges is the richest and most productive portion of Bengal, and abounds in valuable produce. The other mighty river by which Bengal is intersected is the Brahmaputra, the source of whose remotest tributary is on the opposite or northern side of the same Himalayan Mountains from whose southern slopes the Ganges takes its rise. These two rivers proceed in diverging courses until they are more than 1200 miles asunder; and again approaching each other, intermix their waters before they reach the ocean. The principal minor rivers in Bengal (all of which see separately) are\u2014the Gogra (Ghagra), Son (Soane), Gandak, Kusi, Tista; the Hugli (Hoogly), formed by the junction of the Bh\u00e1girathi and Jalangi; farther to the west, the Damodar and Rupnarayan; and in the south-west, the Mahanadi, or 'Great River' of Orissa. In a level country like Bengal, where the soil is composed of yielding and loose materials, the courses of the rivers are continually shifting, from the wearing away of their banks, or from the water being turned off, by obstacles in its course, into a different channel. As the new channel gradually widens, the old bed of the river is left dry. The new channel into which the river flows is, of course, so much land lost, while the old bed constitutes an accession to the adjacent estates. Thus, one man's property is diminished, while that of another is enlarged or improved; and a distinct branch of Anglo-Indian jurisprudence has grown up, the particular province of which is the definition and regulation of the alluvial rights alike of private proprietors and of the State.\n\nMineral Products\u2014Coal.\u2014A very brief enumeration has been given of the principal minerals of Bengal. The coal mines of R\u00e1niganj, in Bardw\u00e1n District, demand a fuller notice. The principal coal companies working within that tract in 1881 were\u2014The Bengal, Equitable, New B\u00edrbh\u00fam, Apcar & Co., Bar\u00e1kh\u00e1r, Alipur, R\u00e1niganj Coal Association, and Sib Kristo Dhar & Co., besides a number of smaller concerns. The miners are chiefly Sant\u00e1ls and Baur\u00eds, and the earth-cutters Dh\u00e1ngars and Kaor\u00e1s. In the R\u00e1niganj coal-field there were in 1881 altogether 45 mines at work, of which 17 turned out more than 10,000 tons of coal each per annum. In the larger and better mines, coal is raised by steam power from pits and galleries; and in the smaller mines or workings, by hand labour from open quarries. In the R\u00e1niganj coal-field alone, 61 steam engines, with an aggregate of 867 horse-power, were at work. Only one seam or set of seams of less thickness than $8\\frac{1}{2}$ feet was worked, and the average thickness of the seams at the R\u00e1niganj mines is about 15 or 16 feet. The pits are usually shallow; very few being more than 150 feet deep. The Bengal Coal Company, with its mines at R\u00e1niganj and to the westward, is able to raise 250,000 tons of coal annually. Dr. Oldham, the late superintendent of the Geological Survey, in his Report on the\nCoal Resources of India (1867), gives an approximate estimate of about fourteen thousand million tons of available coal in the R\u00e1niganj field, after allowing for waste, loss, small coal, etc. The coal, though very inferior to English, is adequate for ordinary railway purposes, and even for steam vessels, with the exception of ocean-going steamers; and *a fortiori* for stationary engines.\n\nThe coal of the R\u00e1niganj coal-field, like most Indian coals, is a non-coking bituminous coal, composed of distinct laminae of a bright coal and of a dull earthy rock, with a large proportion of volatile matter and ash, the amount of the latter averaging about 15 per cent., as against $2\\frac{3}{4}$ per cent. in English coal, and ranging from 8 to 25 per cent. A sample of a very pure coal from the S\u00e1rsol mine gave the following results:\u2014Volatile, 40 per cent.; fixed carbon, 57.5 per cent.; ash, 2.5 per cent. The principal drawbacks to the extended employment of R\u00e1niganj coal in India, and the reasons why the expensive English coal is still generally employed, especially by sea-going steamers on long voyages, are the following:\u2014(1) The non-coking property of R\u00e1niganj coal; (2) the small proportion of fixed carbon, upon which the value of coal for heating purposes depends; (3) the large proportion of ash, a larger quantity of R\u00e1niganj coal being therefore required to perform the same duty as a smaller quantity of good English coal; (4) its liability to spontaneous ignition, which is mainly due to the large quantity of iron pyrites in the coal. The two most heavily worked lines of railway in India, viz. the East Indian and the Great Indian Peninsula, use respectively Indian and English coal, and their relative consumption is 150 tons per mile on the former as compared with 75 tons on the latter.\n\nThere are also coal mines in B\u00e1nkur\u00e1 District, but they are unimportant.\n\nSalt manufacture was formerly a Government monopoly, principally carried on along the sea-coast of Orissa, and in Midnapur District. A description of the manufacture of salt by means of evaporation by fire has been given in the article on BALASOR. The process of manufacture by means of solar evaporation will be described in the Account of PURI DISTRICT. The State abandoned its monopoly of salt manufacture many years ago, and it is now carried on by private parties, subject to a Government duty of 5s. per cwt. At the present day, almost the whole of the salt consumed in Bengal is imported by Liverpool ships from the Cheshire mines. Small quantities are still manufactured in Orissa and the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s under excise rules. In 1881, the Bengal salt duty yielded a net revenue of \u00a32,452,417.\n\nIron.\u2014Several attempts have been made to work the iron ores of Bengal, but hitherto without any decisive success from the mercantile point of view. A company was started a few years ago, and erected\ntwo blast furnaces, but failed through want of capital. The Government has recently purchased the works, and is keeping them in its own hands provisionally, until arrangements can be made for transferring them to a private company. The output when the furnaces are in full working order is estimated at 80 tons of pig-iron per diem. From 300 to 350 tons of cast-iron are produced monthly, worth about \u00a32500. Six hundred workmen are employed casting railway sleepers. Iron-smelting in a very rough manner has been carried on from time immemorial by many aboriginal tribes, especially in the western Districts of Bengal. These rude people work individually on a small scale, but the aggregate produce of their miniature furnaces is considerable. They formerly supplied the whole iron required for weapons and other purposes in Bengal.\n\nHistory.\u2014The history of so large a Province as Bengal forms an integral part of the general history of India. The northern part, Behar, ranked as a powerful kingdom in Sanskrit times, and its chief town, Patn\u00e1, is identified as the Palibothra of the Greeks. The Delta or southern part of Bengal lay beyond the ancient Sanskrit polity, and was governed by a number of local kings belonging to a pre-Aryan stock. The Chinese travellers, Fa Hian in the 5th century, and Hwen Thsang in the 7th century, found the Buddhist religion prevailing throughout Bengal, but already in a fierce struggle with Hinduism\u2014a struggle which ended about the 9th or 10th century in the general establishment of the latter faith. Until the end of the 12th century, Hindu princes ruled over the lower valley of the Ganges, in petty principalities. In 1199, Muhammad Bakhtiy\u00e1r Khilj\u00ed was appointed to lead the first Musalm\u00e1n invasion into Bengal. The Muhammadan conquest of Behar dates from 1200, and the new power speedily spread southwards into the Delta. From about this date until 1336, Bengal was ruled by governors appointed by the Muhammadan Emperors in the north. From 1336 to 1539, its Musalm\u00e1n governors asserted a precarious independence, and arrogated the position of sovereigns on their own account. From 1539 to 1576, Bengal passed under the rule of the Path\u00e1n or Afgh\u00e1n dynasty, which commonly bears the name of Sher Sh\u00e1h. On the overthrow of this house by the powerful arms of Akbar, Bengal was incorporated into the Mughal Empire, and administered by governors appointed by the Delhi Emperor, until the treaties of 1765, which placed Bengal, Behar, and Orissa under the administration of the East India Company. Down to 1854, Bengal remained under the Governor-General of India as Governor, his place being supplied, during his absence in other parts of India, by a Deputy-Governor appointed from among the members of his council. By the statute 16 and 17 Vict. cap. 95, the Governorship of Bengal was separated from the Governor-Generalship of India, and Bengal was erected into a Lieutenant-\nGovernorship. The first Lieutenant-Governor was appointed in 1854; and the constitution of the Government of Bengal still continues on this basis, except that the Lieutenant-Governor is now appointed subject to the approval of the Queen. The foregoing summary must suffice for the general history of Bengal; but many episodes will be narrated under the towns or places where they occurred.

These settlements were of a purely commercial character. In 1620, one of the Company\u2019s factors dates a letter from Patna; in 1624\u201336, the Company established itself, by the favour of the Emperor, on the ruins of the ancient Portuguese settlement of Pippli, in the north of Orissa; in 1640\u201342, the patriotism of an English surgeon, Mr. Gabriel Boughton, obtained for us establishments at Balasor (also in Orissa), and at Hugli, 25 miles above Calcutta. The vexations and extortions to which the Company\u2019s early agents were subjected nearly induced them more than once to abandon the trade, and in 1677\u201378 they threatened to withdraw from Bengal altogether. In 1686, their Bengal factors, driven to extremity by the oppression of the Mughal governors, fled from Hugli down the Ganges to the three villages which have grown up into Calcutta, the metropolis of India. During the next fifty years, the English had a long and hazardous struggle, alike with the Mughal governors of the Province, and with the Maratha armies which invaded it. In 1756, this struggle culminated in the great outrage known as the Black Hole of Calcutta, followed by the re-capture of Calcutta and Clive\u2019s battle of Plassey, which avenged it. That battle, and the subsequent years of confused fighting, established our military supremacy in Bengal, and procured the treaties of 1765, by which the Provinces of Bengal, Behar, and Orissa passed under our administration. To Warren Hastings (1772\u201385) belongs the glory of consolidating our power, and converting a military occupation into a stable civil government. To another member of the civil service, John Shore (1786\u201398), afterwards Lord Teignmouth, is due the formation of a regular system of Anglo-Indian legislation. Acting under Lord Cornwallis, the Governor-General, he ascertained and defined the rights of the landholders in the soil. These landholders under the native system had, for the most part, started as collectors of the revenue, and gradually acquired certain prescriptive rights as quasi-\nproprietors of the estates entrusted to them by the Government. In 1793, Lord Cornwallis declared their rights perpetual, and made over the land of Bengal to the previous quasi-proprietors or zamindars, on condition of the payment of a fixed land tax. This great piece of legislation is known as the Permanent Settlement of the Land Revenue.\n\nBut the Cornwallis Code, while defining the position of the proprietors, failed to give adequate recognition to the rights of the under-tenants and the cultivators. Its Regulations formally reserved the latter class of rights, but did not legally define them, or enable the husbandmen to enforce them in the courts. After half a century of rural disquiet, an attempt was made to formulate the rights of the cultivators by Act x. of 1859, and by several subsequent enactments based upon it. This series of measures, now known as the Land Law of Bengal, endeavoured to effect for the under-holders and cultivators what the Cornwallis Code in 1793 had effected for the superior landholders. The legislation of 1793, conjointly with that of 1859 and subsequent enactments, sought to define the status of each class of person interested in the soil, from the Government as suzerain, through the zamindars or superior landholders, the intermediate tenure-holders, and the under-tenants, down to the actual cultivator. The practical working of the later measures disclosed, however, that the protection which they gave to the rights of the cultivators was less effective and less complete than the protection given by the Cornwallis Code to the rights of the landholders. After a patient trial, extending over twenty years of the Acts inaugurated by the Land Law of 1859, the Bengal Government issued a Commission to inquire into the condition of the agricultural classes, and to submit proposals for placing the relations of landlords and tenants on a better footing. The Report of the Commission forms an invaluable storehouse of information regarding the rural population of Bengal. A Tenancy Bill was based on its recommendations at the instance of the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, and introduced into the Supreme Legislative Council in 1883. This important measure is still under discussion by the Legislative Council (1884).\n\nThe Land Act of 1859 dates from the first year after the transfer of India from the Company to the Crown; for meanwhile the Mutiny had burst out in 1857. The events of that revolt chiefly took place in Northern India, and will be summarised under India and the North-Western Provinces; the uprising, although fierce, and for a time perilous to our supremacy, was quickly put down. In Bengal it began at Berhampur and Barrackpur, was communicated to Dacca in Eastern Bengal, and for a time raged in Behar, producing the memorable defence of the billiard-room at\nARRAH by a handful of civilians and Sikhs\u2014one of the most splendid pieces of gallantry in the history of the British arms. Since 1858, when the country passed to the Crown, the history of Bengal has been one of steady and peaceful progress. Two great lines of railway, the East Indian and the Eastern Bengal, have been completed, as also a network of State lines, and the Darjiling-Himalayan Railway, which belongs to a private company. Trade has enormously expanded; new centres of commerce have sprung up in spots which not long ago were silent jungles. Railways, roads, and communications will, however, form the subject of a separate section, post, pp. 312-315. Fresh staples of trade, such as tea and jute, have rapidly attained importance; and the coal-fields and iron ores are beginning to open up prospects of a novel and splendid era in the internal development of the country.\n\nPopulation\u2014Administrative Divisions.\u2014Within the Provinces under the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal dwell a great congeries of peoples, of widely diverse origin, speaking different languages, and representing far separated eras of civilisation. The area of the British territories constituting the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal is 150,588 square miles, excluding the area of large rivers and of the Sundarbans\u2014a large tract of unsurveyed and half-submerged forest, forming the sea-face of the delta of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, with an estimated area of 5976 square miles. But in addition to Districts under direct British rule are other territories governed by chiefs, in political dependence upon the Government of Bengal. These are the Principalities of Kuch Behar and Hill Tipperah, situated respectively on the north-eastern and eastern boundaries of Bengal, and two groups of petty chiefships on the south and south-west of the Province, known as the Tributary States of Orissa and of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur. These territories comprise an area of 36,634 square miles, making a total area for the whole of Bengal of 187,222 square miles, excluding the Sundarbans, or of 193,198 square miles including that region.\n\nThe Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal is further divided into four great Provinces of unequal size, but with strongly defined characteristics. Three of them are known under the historic names of Bengal, Behar, and Orissa; while the fourth is composed of the still undeveloped and comparatively little explored territory of Chhota or Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur. Of these Provinces, Bengal Proper is by far the largest both in actual area and in population. It extends over 70,430 square miles, exclusive of the Sundarbans, and occupies more than one-third of the whole area. Behar comes next, with an area of 44,139 square miles, or nearly one-fourth of the whole area; Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur has 26,966, and Orissa 9053 square miles; while the Feudatory States aggregate 36,634 square miles.\nThe four British Provinces of the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal are portioned off into nine large tracts of varying area, officially called Divisions, each of which is superintended by a Commissioner. Of these nine Divisions, five\u2014namely, the Presidency, Bardw\u00e1n, R\u00e1jsh\u00e1hi, Dacca, and Chittagong\u2014are within the limits of Bengal proper; two\u2014namely, Patn\u00e1 and Bh\u00e1galpur\u2014make up the Province of Behar; while Orissa and Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur each form a single Commissionership or Division. The Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur Division, although the largest in point of size (26,966 square miles), includes a much larger proportion of uncultivated land, and a smaller population than any other, with the exception of Chittagong, which has less than half its area (12,118 square miles), and of Orissa, which is little more than one-third its size (9053 square miles). The average area of a Commissioner's Division is 16,732 square miles.\n\nThese nine Divisions are again divided into 45 Districts (exclusive of the town and suburbs of Calcutta, and the two Government estates of Ang\u00fal and B\u00e1nki), which exhibit a still greater variation in area than the Divisions. For whereas the largest District, Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1, has an area of 12,045 square miles, the smallest, Howrah, is only 476 square miles in extent, and derives its importance from the existence within its limits of the metropolitan suburb of Howrah. The average size of a District in Bengal is 3323 square miles. Below the Districts are Sub-divisions, of which nearly every District has two or more, each administered by a resident Assistant or Deputy-Magistrate subordinate to the Magistrate of the District. The number of these Sub-divisions in Bengal is 135, with an average area of 1107 square miles, varying from 7804 square miles in the case of Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1, to 33 square miles in the case of Chu\u00e1d\u00e1ng\u00e1 in Nadiy\u00e1. The last and smallest unit of administration recognised in the Census is the th\u00e1n\u00e1 or police circle, which has come to be the acknowledged unit of territorial partition, and is every day being used more and more in all administrative matters. The number of th\u00e1n\u00e1s in Bengal is 622, with an average area of 236 square miles. On an average, each District is broken up into 13 of these police circles, the actual number ranging from 39 in the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s to 4 in D\u00e1rj\u00edling and Jalp\u00e1igur\u00ed.\n\nFor the purposes of revenue administration, the country was divided by the Mughal Government into pargan\u00e1s, or fiscal divisions, each comprising certain villages with their lands. This arrangement formed the basis of our own revenue system; but from its want of compactness, as well as for other reasons, it has been found inconvenient, and in Bengal has fallen into such decay that in some Districts the pargan\u00e1 boundaries can hardly be ascertained. Practically, the pargan\u00e1 divisions have died out, except for purposes of land revenue payments, in favour\nof the simpler and more compact th\u00e1n\u00e1s adopted for purposes of police. The th\u00e1n\u00e1 or police circle is now the unit of local administration.\n\nA better idea of the respective size of the different territorial divisions of Bengal than can be gained by a mere statement of figures, may be obtained by contrasting them with other and more familiar areas. Thus, the area of the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal, including the Feudatory States and the tiger-haunted swamps of the Sundarbans, is very little less than that of Spain, and a good deal more than half as large again as England and Wales. It exceeds the aggregate area of five European States, namely, Denmark, Holland, Belgium, Switzerland, and Greece. One of its four provinces, Behar, is nearly as extensive as the new kingdom of Roumania, or the ancient kingdom of Poland. Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur is a little larger than Ceylon, and a little smaller than Bavaria. Orissa (British) is of almost equal extent with Saxony; and the area of the Feudatory States is rather more than that of Portugal. Taking the nine Divisions or Commissionerships, their average area is somewhat larger than that of Switzerland; while of the largest ones, Patn\u00e1 and Bh\u00e1galpur, the former is almost exactly co-extensive with Belgium and the Netherlands, while the latter is considerably larger than Greece. Dacca Division is the size of Denmark, and the combined area of R\u00e1jsh\u00e1h\u00ed and Bardw\u00e1n Divisions equals that of Scotland. The average Bengal District, with an area of 3323 square miles, is considerably larger than any county in England or Ireland, except Yorkshire, and is most nearly approached by Argyleshire in Scotland. The large Districts exceed in extent any single county in the United Kingdom; and the largest of them, Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1, is greater than the whole of Wales together with the county of York. Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh is larger than the Irish Province of Connaught. The Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s and the Chittagong Hill Tracts are each about as extensive as Alsace-Lorraine. The smallest Bengal District, the suburban Howrah, is nearly twice the size of Middlesex, and not much smaller than the 'kingdom' of Fife. This, however, is an exceptionally small District, and scarcely more extensive than the average Bengal Sub-division. The next smallest District to it, H\u00fagl\u00ed, is nearly four times its size, and almost as large as Gloucestershire. Each Sub-division of a Bengal District is, on the average, exactly the size of an average English county; and the average th\u00e1n\u00e1 or police circle is rather more than twice the size of Malta.\n\nThe average population of each of the 45 Districts of Bengal is a little less than a million and a half, the figures ranging from 3,051,966 in Maimansingh, to 101,597 in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Nine Districts have a population of more than two million souls, while only seven fall below three-quarters of a million. Comparing the population with that of other countries, it will be seen that the population ruled\nover by the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal (69,536,861) exceeds the population of any European country except Russia. It does not fall far short of the total population of France and the United Kingdom put together; it exceeds by 50 per cent. the population of the German Empire, and by 38 per cent. that of the United States of America. The population of one of its four Provinces, Bengal Proper, falls short by only half a million of that of the whole of the United Kingdom. Another of its four Provinces, Behar, supports a population larger than that of Spain and Portugal, and not much less than that of England and Wales. The Uriy\u00e1s of Orissa are almost exactly as numerous as the inhabitants of Scotland; and the mixed races dwelling in the Districts of the Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur Division are very nearly as numerous as the whole population of Canada and the other British possessions in North America. The Commissioner of Patn\u00e1 rules the fortunes of nearly thrice as many persons as the King of the Belgians or the Khedive of Egypt. Chittagong Division, which is the smallest in Bengal in point of numbers, has a population equal to twice that of Norway; and the total of the Feudatory States is just that of the continent of Australia. The other Divisions contain populations which take an intermediate place between European Turkey and Belgium. The average Bengal District has a population equal to that of the Grand Duchy of Baden, the Irish Province of Leinster, the English county of Surrey, or the State of Virginia. Among the larger Districts, Maimansingh has its counterpart in the great States of Illinois and Ohio, or the county of Lancashire, with its commercial cities and swarming manufacturing population. While there are 35 Districts in Bengal with upwards of a million of inhabitants, only 4 counties in England exceed that total. Indeed, the counterpart in Bengal of the British county is not the District, but the Sub-division; and if the metropolitan county of Middlesex be omitted, a sub-divisional officer in Bengal is entrusted with the supervision of a larger number of persons than inhabit an English county.\n\nThe table on the two following pages exhibits the area, population, etc. of each Province, Division, and District in Bengal, as ascertained by the Census of 1881:\n\nGeneral Survey of the Population.\u2014The Government in Bengal is complicated by the fact that, while this vast population is ruled by a single head, it consists of elements so dissimilar as to render it impracticable to place them under one system of administration. They exhibit every stage of human progress, and every type of human enlightenment and superstition\u2014from the sceptical educated classes, represented by the Hindu gentleman who distinguishes himself at Oxford or a London Inn of Court, to the hill chieftain who a few years ago sacrificed\n\n[Sentence continued on p. 287.]\n## Census of Bengal, 1881.\n\n| Division | Districts | Population |

A large section of the people belongs to the august Aryan race, from which we ourselves descend. Its classical language, Sanskrit, is as near to our own as that of the Welsh or Scottish Highlanders. We address the Deity and his earthly representatives, our father and mother, by words derived from roots common to the Christian and Hindu. Nor does the religious instinct assume a wider variety of manifestations, or exhibit a more striking series of metamorphoses, among the European than among the Indian branches of the race. Theodore Parker and Comte are more read by the advanced Hindus, known as 'Young Bengal,' than any Sanskrit theologian. On the same bench of a Calcutta college sit youths trained up in the strictest theism, others indoctrinated in the mysteries of the Hindu trinity and pantheon, with representatives of every link in the chain of superstition\u2014from the harmless offering of flowers before the family god, to the cruel rites of K\u00e1li, to whom a human victim was offered in H\u00fagl\u00ed District, twenty-five miles from Calcutta, as lately as the famine of 1866. Indeed, the very word Hindu is one of absolutely indeterminate meaning. The Census officers employ it as a convenient generic term to include $45\\frac{1}{2}$ millions of the population of Bengal, comprising elements of transparently distinct ethnical origin, separated from each other by language, customs, and religious rites.\n\nBut Hinduism, understood even in this wide sense, represents only one of many creeds and races found within Bengal. The other great historical cultus, which, during the last twelve centuries, did for the Semitic peoples what Christianity accomplished among the European Aryans, has won to itself one-third of the whole population of Bengal. The Muhammadans amount to nearly 22 millions; and the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal is, so far as numbers go, as great a Musalm\u00e1n power as the Sult\u00e1n of Turkey himself. The remaining $2\\frac{1}{2}$ millions of the population are composed chiefly of half savage tribes professing aboriginal religions, but include 128,000 converts to Christianity.\n\nAmid the stupendous catastrophes of river inundations, famines, tidal waves, and cyclones of the Lower Provinces of Bengal, the religious instinct works with a vitality unknown in European countries, where the forces of Nature have long yielded to the control of man. Until the British Government stepped in with its police, and canals, and railroads, between the people and what they were accustomed to consider as the dealings of Providence, scarcely a year passed without some terrible manifestation of the power and the wrath of God. Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 invasions from Central India, piratical devastations on the seaboard, banditti who marched about the interior in bodies of 50,000 men, floods which drowned the harvests of many Districts, and droughts\nin which a third of the population starved to death, kept alive a sense of human powerlessness in the presence of an Omnipotent fate with an intensity which the homilies of a State clergy sometimes fail to awaken. Under the Muhammadans, a pestilence turned the early capital into a wilderness, never again to be re-peopled. Under our own rule, it is estimated that 10 millions perished within the Lower Provinces alone during the famine of 1769-70; and the first Surveyor-General of Bengal entered on his maps a tract of many hundreds of square miles as bare of villages, with the words written across it, 'depopulated by the Maghs.'\n\nPopular Religions.\u2014The people of Bengal, thus constantly reminded by calamity of a mysterious Supreme Power, have always exhibited deep earnestness in their modes of propitiating that Power, and a singular susceptibility to new forms of faith. Great tidal waves of religion have again and again swept over the Provinces within even the brief period of the Christian era. Isl\u00e1m was one of several reformed creeds offered to them; and many circumstances combined to render its influence more widely spread and more permanent than that of its rivals. It was the creed of the governing power; its missionaries were men of zeal, who spoke to the popular heart; it brought the good news of the unity of God and the equality of man to a priest-ridden and caste-ridden people. Above all, the initiatory rite made relapse impossible, and rendered the convert and his posterity true believers for ever. Forcible conversions are occasionally recorded, with several well-known instances of Hindus becoming apostates from their ancient faith to purchase pardon for crime. Such cases, however, were comparatively few in number, and belonged to the higher ranks. It would also appear that a Mughal adventurer now and then circumcised off-hand the villages allotted to him in fief. But it was not to such measures that Isl\u00e1m owed its success in Bengal. It appealed to the people, and it derived the great mass of its converts from among the poor. It introduced a truer conception of God, a nobler ideal of the life of man; and it offered to the teeming low-castes of Bengal, who had sat for ages despised and abject beyond the outermost pale of the Hindu community, free entrance into a new social organization. So far as local tradition, and the other fragmentary evidence that survives, enable a modern inquirer to judge, the creed of Muhammad was for the most part spread in Bengal neither by violence nor by any ignoble means. It succeeded because it deserved to succeed.\n\nNevertheless, it conspicuously failed to alter the permanent religious conceptions of the people. The initiatory rite separated the Musalm\u00e1ns from the rest of the Bengali population, and elevated the heterogeneous low-caste converts into a respectable community of Isl\u00e1m. But the proselytes brought their old superstitions with them into\ntheir new faith. Their ancient rites and modes of religious thought reasserted themselves with an intensity that could not be suppressed, until the fierce white light of Semitic monotheism almost flickered out amid the fuliginous exhalations of Hinduism. A local writer, speaking from personal acquaintance with the Musalm\u00e1n peasantry in the northern Districts of Lower Bengal in our own day, stated that not one in ten could recite the brief and simple kalma or creed, whose constant repetition is a matter of unconscious habit with all good Muhammadans. He described them as a 'sect which observes none of the ceremonies of its faith, which is ignorant of the simplest formulas of its creed, which worships at the shrines of a rival religion, and tenaciously adheres to practices which were denounced as the foulest abominations by its founder.' Fifty years ago, these sentences would have truly described the Muhammadan peasantry, not only in the northern Districts, but throughout all Lower Bengal. In the cities or amid the palace life of the Musalm\u00e1n nobility and their religious foundations, a few Maulvis of piety and learning calmly carried on the routine of their faith. But the masses of the rural Musalm\u00e1ns had relapsed into something little better than a mongrel breed of circumcised low-caste Hindus. Since then, another of those religious awakenings so characteristic of India has passed over the Muhammadans of Bengal. Itinerant preachers, generally from the north, have wandered from District to District, calling on the people to return to the true faith, and denouncing God's wrath on the indifferent and unrepentant. A great body of the Bengali Musalm\u00e1ns have purged themselves of the taint of Hinduism, and shaken off the yoke of the ancient social rites.\n\nThis Muhammadan revival has had a threefold effect in Bengal\u2014religious, social, and political. It has stimulated the religious instinct among an impressionable people, and produced an earnest desire to cleanse the worship of God and His Prophet from idolatry. Its stern rejection of ancient superstitions has also widened the social gulf between the Muhammadans and the Hindus. Fifty years ago the Bengali Musalm\u00e1ns were simply a recognised caste, less widely separated from the lower orders of the Hindus than the latter were from the Kulin Br\u00e1hmans. There were certain essential points of difference, of a doctrinal sort, between the Hindu and Muhammadan villager; but they had a great many rural customs and even religious rites in common. The Muhammadan husbandman theoretically recognised the one Semitic God; but in a country subject to floods, famines, the devastations of banditti, and the ravages of wild beasts, he would have deemed it foolish to neglect the Hindu festivals in honour of Krishna and Durg\u00e1. Now, however, the peasantry no longer look to their gods, but to the officer in charge of the District, for protection; and when he fails them, instead of offering\nexpiatory sacrifices to K\u00e1l\u00ed, they petition Government, or write violent letters to the vernacular press. The reformed Muhammadan husbandmen, therefore, can now stand aloof from the rites of the Hindus. They have ceased to be merely a separate caste in the rural organization, and have become a distinct community, keeping as much apart from their Muhammadan co-religionists of the old unreformed faith as from the idolatrous Hindus. This social isolation from the surrounding Hindus is the second effect of the Musalm\u00e1n revival in Bengal. Its third result is political, and concerns ourselves. A Muhammadan, like a Christian revival, strongly re-asserts the duty of self-abnegation, and places a multitude of devoted instruments at the disposal of any man who can convince them that his schemes are identical with the will of God. But while a return to the primitive teachings of Christ means a return to a religion of humanity and love, a return to Muhammadan first principles means a return to a religion of conquest and aggression. The very essence of Musalm\u00e1n Puritanism is abhorrence of the Infidel. The whole conception of Isl\u00e1m is that of a church either actively militant or conclusively triumphant\u2014forcibly converting the world, or ruling the stiff-necked unbeliever with a rod of iron. The actual state of India, where it is the Musalm\u00e1ns who are in subjection, and the unbeliever who governs them, is manifestly not in accord with the primitive ideal; and many devout Muhammadans of the reformed faith have of late years endeavoured, by plots and frontier attacks, to remove this anomaly. The majority are not actively hostile, but they look askance at our institutions, and hesitate to coalesce with the system which the British Government has imposed on Bengal. The progress of education, and the good sense of the great majority of the Bengali Musalmans, now leave the aggressively discontented section in a very small minority. As the Ruling Power has more clearly realised its duties to the Muhammadan population, and more conscientiously discharged those duties, the Muhammadan community has become not only more loyal, but more disposed to cheerfully incorporate itself into the existing political organisation.\n\nTheistic Movements.\u2014As a result of the spread of education also, many religious movements have been going on since 1830 among the Hindus. A sect named the \u2018Adi-Brahmo\u2019 adopts a theism based on the Veda, and a simple morality, without the superstructure of Br\u00e1hmanical Hinduism. It includes among its members many persons of high character and social position. Another sect, the Brahmos, often styled the Progressive Brahmos, profess a purer theism and a high standard of morality. They reject the claims of the Veda to divine inspiration, and have to some extent thrown off the more objectionable restrictions of caste. Babu Keshab Chandra Sen was their best-known recent leader. The death of that truly great man occurred\nwhile these sheets were passing through the press (1884), and has left a blank in the Indian religious world. Some of his more zealous followers already disclose an inclination to accord divine honours to their beloved teacher and friend. The number of educated natives who hold Brahmo opinions is considerable. Another result of education has been the formation of religious, social, or political associations in all parts of the country, about 60 in number, with 2000 members. They are directed chiefly to educational matters, and to the abolition of the cruel restrictions imposed by custom or superstition. Great religious movements also take place among the low-castes. Holy men or teachers spring up, sometimes close to Calcutta, sometimes in secluded Districts, and make thousands or hundreds of thousands of converts. The Vaishnava sect is now the prevailing one in Bengal. Among the low-caste Districts of the east, especially in Assam, it absorbs almost the whole of the inferior classes of the Hindus. It starts from a revolt against the spiritual bondage imposed by the distinctions of caste.\n\nAboriginal Creeds.\u2014Besides the 45\u00bd millions of Hindus, and the 22 millions of Musalmans, a great residue remains. It consists, with the exception of the two small bodies of Christians and Buddhists, of semi-aboriginal and distinctly non-Aryan races, who number 2\u00bc millions in Bengal. These peoples dwell, for the most part, among the lofty ranges and primeval forests which wall in Bengal on the north, east, and south-west, or upon the spurs and hilly outworks which these mountain systems have thrown forward upon the lowlands. Some of them represent the simplest types of social organization known to modern research. Their rudimentary communities are separated by religion, custom, and language from each other and from the dwellers on the plains. Many of them, till lately, looked upon war as the normal condition of human society, and on peace as an unwelcome temporary break in their existence. For ages they have regarded the lowland Hindus as their natural enemies, and in return they were dealt with as beasts of chase by the more civilised inhabitants of the valleys. Within the present generation, human sacrifice continued an obligatory rite among some of them\u2014a rite so deeply graven upon their village institutions, and so essential to the annually recurring festivals of their religious year, as to seriously occupy the Indian Legislature, and to require a special agency to suppress it. Their jealousy of anything like foreign rule renders it the wisest policy to leave them as much as possible under their own hamlet communities and petty chiefs. Nevertheless, they form the most hopeful material yet discovered in Bengal for the humanizing influences of Christianity, and of that higher level of morality and civilisation which Christian missions represent. One of the most noteworthy features of the Indian Census of 1881, as\ncompared with that of 1872, is the decrease of the aboriginal population. This decrease is, however, apparent rather than real, and the result of a different system of classification. But it is also to some extent an index of the increasing rapidity with which the aboriginal races are merging in the general population.\n\n**Early Estimates of Population.** \u2014 The Census taken during the cold weather of 1871-72 was the first that had been attempted throughout Bengal. Previous to that date, partial enumerations of special areas had been made from time to time; but these were either estimates based upon the number of houses in the District incorrectly computed, or conclusions drawn from experience and general observation, and entitled to little reliance. The population shown by the Census of 1872 far exceeded the total of any such previous estimates. With few exceptions, every District in the Province was found to be more thickly peopled than the most liberal official calculation had anticipated. In 1765, the population had been assumed at 10 millions; Sir William Jones in 1787 thought it might amount to 24 millions; Mr. Colebrook in 1802 calculated it at 30 millions. Dr. Buchanan-Hamilton had, however, about this period made an estimate of the population of several Districts, which he put much higher than other authorities. In the years just before the Census, the population had been generally accepted at about 40 millions for the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal, which then included Assam.\n\nThe Census of 1872 suddenly disclosed a population of 62,705,718 for Bengal, excluding Assam, or more than 50 per cent. above the previously accepted estimate. The Census of 1881, taken nine years afterwards, showed that the population had increased during that period to 69,536,861, being an advance of 6,831,143, or 10.89 per cent., which yields a yearly rate of progress of 759,015, or 1.21 per cent. A part of the increase thus shown is, however, only nominal, being due to omissions and defects in the Census of 1872.\n\nThis vast population is spread over an area of 187,222 square miles, residing in 264,765 towns and villages, and occupying 11,036,774 houses. Classified according to religion, there were in 1881\u2014Hindus, 45,452,806; Muhammadans, 21,704,724; Buddhists, 155,809; Christians, 128,135; Jains, 1609; Sikhs, 549; Brahmos, 788; Parsis, 156; Jews, 1059; and 'others,' consisting almost entirely of hill and jungle tribes professing aboriginal faiths, 2,091,226.\n\n**Density.** \u2014 The density of the population is subject to wide variations; the average number of persons to the square mile in 1881 being 524 throughout Behar, 505 in Bengal Proper, 412 in Orissa, 156 in Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, and 77 throughout the Tributary States. The average over the whole inhabited area of the Lieutenant-Governorship in 1881\nwas 371 to the square mile. In the United Kingdom in 1871 the average density was 260; in Germany, 187; and in France, 180. The metropolitan Districts of H\u00fagl\u00ed, Howrah, and the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s; the trading Districts of Dacca, Far\u00eddpur, and Pabn\u00e1, rich in their river communications and in the prosperity of their inhabitants; and the Behar Districts of Patn\u00e1, Darbhanga, Muzaffarpur, and S\u00e1ran,\u2014are the most populous parts of Bengal. In all these Districts there is an average population of over 700 persons to the square mile, while no less than 11 other Districts support a population of over 500 to the square mile. But though Behar and the Gangetic Delta are densely populated, there remain large tracts of territory where the people are very sparsely scattered. Thus, while the average density in Howrah District is 1334 to the square mile, in the Chittagong Hill Tracts it is only 18, and in Hill Tipperah 23. The average number of villages or rural communes per square mile throughout Bengal is 1.41; the average number of persons per village, 262; the average number of persons per house, 6.30.\n\nNationalities.\u2014The Bengalis occupy the whole of Bengal Proper, together with the Districts of Maldah and M\u00e1nbh\u00fam, parts of Purniah, and of the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s. They number about 36\u00bd millions. The people of Behar are Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed\u015b, speaking nearly the same language as, and almost identical in their manners with, the 40 or 50 millions of Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed\u015b who inhabit the North-Western Provinces, Oudh, the Central Provinces, and R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Throughout the most advanced Districts of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur they are numerous, and have introduced their language, manners, and civilisation, the aborigines having, as usual, succumbed to external influences. Altogether, the Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed or Hindi-speaking people within the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal number about 25 millions. The Uriy\u00e1 speakers of Orissa, including hillmen and dwellers on the plains, are about 5\u00bd millions.\n\nThe large number of Muhammadans (19,559,252) found in Lower Bengal was one of the most interesting of the facts brought out by the Census of 1872. During the nine years preceding 1881, their number has increased to 21,704,724, an advance of nearly 11 per cent. Little change has, however, taken place in the localisation of this religion, and the Districts where Muhammadans were most numerous in 1872 still retain their position. The vast majority, namely nearly 18 millions, are found in Bengal Proper; in Behar, they hardly number more than 3\u00bc millions, out of a total population of 23 millions; in Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur and Orissa, they are very sparse. In Bogr\u00e1 District, Muhammadans form as much as 80 per cent. of the population; in R\u00e1jsh\u00e1hi, 78 per cent.; and in Pabn\u00e1, 72 per cent. In the Districts of Chittagong and No\u00e1kh\u00e1l\u00ed, the Musalm\u00e1ns constitute nearly three-fourths of the population. It is\nnot in the great Muhammadan capitals that the Musalm\u00e1ns are most numerous. In Dacca, long their seat of government, the Muhammadans are very slightly in excess of Hindus; in Maldah District, which contained the earlier capital, Gaur, the Muhammadans form only 46 per cent. of the population; in Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d, 48 per cent.; in Patn\u00e1 they form 12 per cent., and even in Patn\u00e1 city itself not more than 24 per cent. On the other hand, apart from the Districts already mentioned, in B\u00e1karganj, Tipperah, and Maimansingh they constitute two-thirds of the population; and in Din\u00e1jpur, Rangpur, Nadiy\u00e1, Khuln\u00e1, Jessor, and Far\u00eddpur, more than one half. Wherever the Muhammadans form the bulk of the population in Bengal, it will be found that they are the cultivating classes of the people, while the upper and mercantile classes are Hindus, and the very low classes are semi-Hindus, probably for the most part aboriginal in blood. All the sailors of the eastern Districts are Muhammadans.\n\nThe number of Muhammadans in Behar is comparatively small. They chiefly belong to the upper orders, and live in towns such as Patn\u00e1, Barh, and Behar. The great body of the cultivating classes in Behar are still Hindus. The fabric of Hinduism was too firm in the north to be shaken by the Musalm\u00e1n invasion, and the new faith produced few converts. Although aboriginal tribes are still to be found in Behar, they probably did not during the era of Musalm\u00e1n conquest form so large a percentage of the population as in the delta of Bengal. Swept on before the earlier Aryan tide of immigration, large numbers of them had been exterminated, or driven down the Gangetic valley, or fled into the wilds of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur. The Aryan element in Behar was thus left to itself, and seems to have consolidated its position sufficiently to be able to resist the shock of a proselytizing faith like Isl\u00e1m. In Bengal Proper this was not the case. The Muhammadans found Hinduism there resting on weak foundations, and with but a feeble hold on the great bulk of the inhabitants. The Aryan element from the north, so far from displacing the children of the soil in Lower Bengal, only held its own by frequent importations of fresh Br\u00e1hman blood from Upper India. Thus it happened that, when the Musalm\u00e1n conquerors of Hindustan invaded the lower delta with the sword and the Koran, they were not altogether unwelcome. They proclaimed equality, and broke down the trammels of caste. In Lower Bengal, Hinduism succumbed, and great masses of the people embraced the faith of Muhammad.\n\nEuropeans and Eurasians.\u2014The Census of 1872 returned the Europeans and non-Asiatics within the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal (including Eurasians) at 37,414. Their number, according to the Census of 1881, was 39,473. In regard to their local distribution among the four Provinces of the Lieutenant-Governorship, the\nnumber of Europeans and non-Asiatics (including Eurasians) in Bengal Proper is (1881) 34,471. Of this total, 25,566 are found in Calcutta and its neighbourhood, 1868 in the Twenty-four Parganas, 1673 in Howrah, 1043 in Dacca, 821 in B\u0101karganj, 687 in D\u0101rjiling, 772 in Bardw\u0101n, 366 in Hugl\u012b, and scarcely more than 200 in any other District. In the Province of Behar, the Europeans and non-Asiatics (including Eurasians) number 4802; 2165 being in Patn\u0101 District and 890 in Monghyr. The European and non-Asiatic population in Chuti\u0101 N\u0101gpur is very small, bringing up the total to 39,473 for the entire Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal. Of these, European British born subjects number 10,583; other Europeans, 13,638; Americans, 392; Australians, 88; Africans, 67; Eurasians, 14,705. Of the Eurasian community, 9581, or more than half, are in Calcutta and the Twenty-four Parganas; 841 in Dacca; 759 in B\u0101karganj; and 702 in Howrah. In Dacca and Chittagong there are colonies of Firinghis, mixed descendants of Portuguese, who made these places their head-quarters in Eastern Bengal.\n\nThe population of Asiatics, other than natives of India, is 93,110, for the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal. These are composed mostly of Nep\u0101lis in D\u0101rjiling and on the northern frontier of Behar. The Armenian community consists of 802 persons, chiefly in Calcutta and Dacca; the Chinese number 309, nearly all shoemakers and carpenters in Calcutta; there are 1059 Jews, mainly in the metropolis; and 156 Parsis.\n\nChristians, native and European together, numbered 90,000 in 1872, and 128,135 in 1881; less than one-third being Europeans or East Indians. The native converts, who number altogether 86,306 persons, are chiefly found in the Presidency, Dacca, and Chuti\u0101 N\u0101gpur Divisions. In Chuti\u0101 N\u0101gpur alone there are nearly 40,000 converts, who belong mainly to the aboriginal tribes. Of the different denominations of Christians in the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal, the most numerous are\u2014Church of England, 23,162; Roman Catholic, 26,925; Lutheran, 23,556; Baptist, 16,985; and Church of Scotland, 3689.\n\nAboriginal Tribes.\u2014The Census of 1872 returned 3,000,000 persons as belonging to aboriginal tribes, who had not adopted any form of Hinduism. In the Census of 1882, their number is given at 2,000,000 for the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal. It is impossible, however, to draw any very distinct line between the aborigines and Hindu races, as they merge insensibly into one another. Large numbers of low-caste and outcaste people are aboriginal in blood, and can scarcely be said to be Hindu in any real sense, although they are entered as such in the Census returns. The low-castes have deities and religious observances of their own, and are only entered as Hindus because they do not come under any other specific race-name. The apparent decrease\nof the aborigines in the Census of 1881 is due to differences in classification, and not to any diminution of their actual numbers. Many of them have during the nine years merged more closely into Hinduism.\n\nIn Bengal Proper the non-Hindu aboriginal population is 252,146, of whom 219,202 are Sant\u00e1ls. The semi-Hinduized aborigines number 1,608,178. Chand\u00e1ls (1,564,000) are the great Pariah caste, to which was doubtless consigned the bulk of the aboriginal tribes who embraced Hinduism in Bengal; they are most numerous in the Eastern Districts. The Kochs are much the same as the P\u00e1lis of Din\u00e1jpur and Maldah and the R\u00e1jbans\u00eds of Rangpur, and these castes together number considerably over a million; they are chiefly cultivators, and are evidently an Indo-Chinese race. The Bagd\u00eds (720,302) and Baoris (252,418) are the fishermen and palanquin-bearers of Western Bengal. Cham\u00e1rs and Much\u00eds (409,662) prepare hides and work in leather.\n\nAmong recognised Hindus, the Br\u00e1hmans, the Kshattriyas or R\u00e1jputs, and the K\u00e1yasths are the three superior castes. Even in these three well-defined castes differences of rank and classification exist. But the general Census return for 1881 gives the following numbers for each, within the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal:\u2014acknowledged Br\u00e1hmans, 2,754,100; R\u00e1jputs or Kshattriyas, 1,499,354; K\u00e1yasths, 1,450,843. The B\u00e1bhans or cultivating Br\u00e1hmans, chiefly in Behar, number 1,931,501. As regards the local distribution of castes in the four Provinces of the Lieutenant-Governorship, the following facts may be noted.\n\nIn Bengal Proper there are 1,076,854 Br\u00e1hmans, 1,056,093 K\u00e1yasths, 110,539 R\u00e1jputs, and 87,536 Baidiy\u00e1s. The Baniy\u00e1s (317,779) are the most populous of the trading castes; Go\u00e1l\u00e1s (613,132) are the great pastoral caste. The chief cultivating Hindu castes are the Kaibarttas (2,006,340) and the Sadgops (547,032). Among the boating and fishing castes are the Jal\u00edy\u00e1s (374,655), Teors (228,675), and Pods (324,568). Of the artisan classes, the oilmen are the most important, numbering altogether (Telis or Til\u00eds, and K\u00e1lus) 515,042; Sunr\u00edis, or wine-sellers, number 382,506; Kum\u00e1rs, or potters, 252,296; and Kam\u00e1rs, or blacksmiths, 285,620; the total of all the weaving castes is close upon a million; 438,545 Vaishnavs are enumerated among the Hindus who no longer recognise caste.\n\nIn Behar, the Sant\u00e1ls (559,625) are the most numerous of the aboriginal tribes; the semi-Hinduized aborigines amount to about half a million. The Dos\u00e1dhs (1,052,564) are the ordinary labouring class. Cham\u00e1rs, or Much\u00eds, number 882,113; Mus\u00e1hars, 527,831; Bhuiy\u00e1s, 182,954; Pas\u00eds, 147,041. Among Hindu castes, Br\u00e1hmans number 1,076,643; R\u00e1jputs, 1,166,593; B\u00e1bhans, 985,098; and K\u00e1yasths, 358,068. The Ah\u00edrs, or Go\u00e1l\u00e1s, form everywhere the largest portion\nof the Hindu population, numbering 2,642,957 altogether. Of the agricultural classes, the Koer\u00eds (1,124,361) rank first, and then the Kurmis (790,523).\n\nIn the British Districts of Orissa, 4665 persons have been classed as belonging to aboriginal tribes; 123,896 as semi-Hinduized aborigines; 3,443,791 as Hindus; 66,362 as of Hindu extraction, but not recognizing caste; and 85,611 as Muhammadans. The aboriginal tribes are principally found in the wild and mountainous tract which constitutes the Tributary States. Br\u00e1hmans number 394,012; the Karans and K\u00e1yasths, 103,105; the Gaurs (289,715) form the great pastoral caste, corresponding to the Go\u00e1l\u00e1s of Behar and Bengal. The Khand\u00e1its (544,422) are an important class in Orissa. Originally they composed the militia, and held land on military tenures; they then became cultivators, and are now hardly to be distinguished from the Ch\u00e1s\u00e1 (375,090), or agricultural caste.\n\nThe population of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur is composed of about 1\u00bd millions of aboriginal tribes and about 2\u00bc millions of Hindus. Of the aborigines, about \u00be of a million are very primitive, and about the same number have been subjected to Hindu influences. The Kols number 791,750; Sant\u00e1ls, 238,621; Bhuiy\u00e1s, 185,573; Bhumijis, 137,282; and Kharw\u00e1rs, 127,073. Nearly one-third of the Hindus of the Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur Division are found in the District of M\u00e1nbh\u00fam. The most important agricultural caste is that of the Kurmis, numbering over a quarter of a million.\n\nThe Feudatory States under the control of the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal may be divided into two groups; the first consisting of the petty states attached to the Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur and Orissa Divisions, 24 in number; and the other comprising the States of Hill Tipperah and Kuch Behar, which lie to the east and to the north of Bengal. The inhabitants of the first group are hillmen of Kolarian or Dravidian origin, and their condition is still very primitive. The largest tribes among them are the Gonds (93,129), Kols (62,109), and Bhuiy\u00e1s (23,686). Hill Tipperah, on the other hand, is the home of a race, partly Indo-Burmese, and partly drawn from the Eastern Himalayas. In Kuch Behar, an Indo-Chinese people, the Koch, who gave their name to the territory, are represented by 300,000 souls.\n\nClassification according to Sex and Age. \u2014 The population of the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal, including the dependent Feudatory States, amounted in 1881, as already stated, to 69,536,861 persons. Of this number, 34,625,591, or 49\u00b779 per cent., were males, and 34,911,270, or 50\u00b720 per cent., females. In Bengal Proper alone of the four Provinces making up the Lieutenant-Governorship was this proportion reversed, and here the males were 50\u00b715 in every hundred, as against 49\u00b784 females. The proportion of women\nto men is greatest in Behar, where the number of women in 10,000 is 5076 to 4923 men. In Calcutta, the males are exactly twice as numerous as the females, the figures in 100 of both sexes being 66 and 33 respectively. In agricultural Districts, or in localities in which the density of the population or other local circumstances favour the emigration of the males, the female element predominates. Thus, in Chittagong, which sends many of its men abroad as sailors, or as labourers into Burma, the women number 53'04 in every 100 persons to 46'95 men. In Dacca, which also contributes to the seafaring population, the females number 51'14 per cent. The agricultural and thickly populated Districts of Patn\u00e1 Division, with the exception of Champ\u00e1ran, all show an excess of females. So also do the Orissa Districts of Cuttack and Balasor, and all the Districts of the Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur Division, which are subject to a constant drain of men who leave their homes to work as coolies, pallki-bearers, earth-work labourers and domestic servants, in other parts of Bengal.\n\nIn the first Census of Bengal, in 1872, the population was roughly divided into children and adults, the line of demarcation being drawn at 12 years of age. But at the Census of 1881 ages were more fully recorded. Divided into decennial periods, the proportions of the population in each stage were returned as follows:\u2014Under 10 years of age, 29'69 per cent.; from 10 to 19, 17'79 per cent.; from 20 to 29, 16'84 per cent.; from 30 to 39, 14'48 per cent.; from 40 to 49, 9'66 per cent.; from 50 to 59, 5'88 per cent.; 60 years and upwards, 5'58 per cent. That is to say, out of every 100 persons of both sexes, nearly one-third are under 10 years of age, and nearly one-half, or 47'48 per cent., are less than 20 years of age. When the figures for each sex are examined separately, the apparent proportions in the second and third periods differ considerably. Between the ages 10-19, the proportion of males is 18'95 per cent., and of females 17'79 per cent.; while between 20-29, the proportion of males is 15'93 per cent., that of females is 16'85 per cent. The excess of youths as returned between 10 and 20, and of females between 20 and 30, is partly due to the fact that girls arrive at maturity sooner than boys, so that their age is frequently overstated; and partly to the reserve which natives of Bengal experience in speaking of the women of their household, and which leads them either to understate their age and describe them as children, or to overstate it and return them as middle-aged women. The proportion of children is relatively largest among the aboriginal tribes.\n\nTown and Rural Population.\u2014The absence of large towns is one of the most remarkable statistical features of Bengal. The population beyond Calcutta and its suburbs is almost entirely rural. With the exception of London, however, no city in the British Empire has so great a population as Calcutta, including its suburbs, the south\nsuburban municipality, and the municipality of Howrah on the opposite bank of the river. These various suburbs are as much a part of Calcutta as Lambeth or Chelsea is of London, and give it a gross population of 790,286. Even excluding the suburbs, the central municipality of Calcutta with its 433,219 inhabitants is only exceeded by Liverpool and Glasgow. Next to Calcutta comes Patn\u00e1, the capital of Behar, with 170,654 inhabitants. In Bengal Proper, outside Calcutta and its suburbs, the largest town is Dacca, 97,076. The city of Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d, the former seat of Government under the N\u00e1wabs Nazim, has now only 39,231 souls. There are altogether 33 towns in the Province with upwards of 20,000 inhabitants, and 200 with over 5000. Most of these so-called \u2018towns,\u2019 however, are mere collections of rural hamlets in which all the operations of husbandry are carried on. The 33 chief towns are the following:\n\n**THIRTY-THREE TOWNS IN BENGAL (1881) CONTAINING UPWARDS OF 20,000 INHABITANTS.**\n\n| Towns                                      | Population |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Calcutta (without suburbs),                | 433,219    |\n| Calcutta Suburbs,                          | 251,439    |\n| Patn\u00e1,                                     | 170,654    |\n| Howrah,                                    | 105,206    |\n| Dacca,                                     | 79,076     |\n| Gay\u00e1,                                      | 76,415     |\n| Bh\u00e1galpur,                                 | 68,238     |\n| Darbhanga,                                 | 65,955     |\n| Monghyr,                                   | 55,372     |\n| Chapra,                                    | 51,670     |\n| South Suburban Municipality of Calcutta,   | 51,658     |\n| Behar,                                     | 48,968     |\n| Arrah,                                     | 42,998     |\n| Cuttack,                                   | 42,656     |\n| Muzaffarpur,                               | 42,460     |\n| Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d,                               | 39,231     |\n| Dinapur,                                   | 37,893     |\n| Bardw\u00e1n,                                   | 34,080     |\n| Midnapur,                                  | 33,560     |\n| H\u00fagli and Chinsura,                        | 31,177     |\n| Agarp\u00e1r\u00e1,                                  | 30,317     |\n| Bar\u00e1nagar,                                 | 29,952     |\n| S\u00e1ntipur,                                  | 29,687     |\n| Krishnagar,                                | 27,477     |\n| Serampur,                                  | 25,559     |\n| H\u00e1jjipur,                                  | 25,078     |\n| Berhampur,                                 | 23,605     |\n| Puri,                                      | 22,095     |\n| Naihati,                                   | 21,533     |\n| Bettiah,                                   | 21,203     |\n| Sir\u00e1jganj,                                 | 21,037     |\n| Chittagong,                                | 20,999     |\n| Balasor,                                   | 20,265     |\n\nThe actual urban population of the 200 towns containing upwards of 5000 inhabitants amounted to 3,664,229, or about 5\u00b726 per cent. of the entire population. In the smallness of its urban population, Bengal ranks last among all the great Provinces of India, the Central Provinces coming next with 6\u00b704 per cent. Of the 264,765 villages and towns, no fewer than 165,263 contained less than two hundred inhabitants; 67,307 had from two to five hundred inhabitants; 23,561 from five hundred to a thousand; 6994 from one to two thousand; 1058 from two to three thousand; 340 from three to five thousand; 146 from five to ten thousand; 49 from ten to fifteen thousand; 14\nfrom fifteen to twenty thousand; 22 from twenty to fifty thousand; and 11 upwards of fifty thousand inhabitants.\n\nThe total rural population in villages and places containing less than five thousand inhabitants was 65,558,430, the average population of a 'village' or rural commune being 247\u00b78. The boat population, under which term are included only those persons who were actually sleeping in boats on the night of the Census, and not those who obtain their livelihood from the sea or rivers, was 309,336, or 44 per cent. of the whole population. The numbers and proportion are greatest in the Eastern Districts, where, for many months in the year, communication is almost entirely maintained by water, and where the inhabitants lead an almost amphibious existence. The proportion reaches its maximum in the City of Calcutta, where special pains were taken to enumerate the vast numbers of boats which lie along the banks of the H\u00fagl\u00ed. The Chittagong Hill Tracts come second. Khuln\u00e1 District stands third, with 3\u00b770 per cent. of its whole population enumerated in boats; and the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, the suburbs of Calcutta, Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d, Dacca, B\u00e1karganj, and Maldah each have a boat population of more than 1 per cent.\n\nThe number of houses in Bengal was returned at 11,645,383, of which 11,036,774 were occupied, and 608,609 unoccupied. This number gives an average of 6\u00b730 to each occupied house. The average varies very slightly throughout the four Provinces outside the limits of Calcutta. In Calcutta there are 12\u00b754 inhabitants to each occupied house.\n\nThe villages in Bengal are isolated clusters of homesteads, built without any arrangement or order, whose inhabitants live very much among themselves, and cling tenaciously to their own homes. The old communal institutions by which the village was governed are fading away under the influence of British rule and the zamind\u00e1ri system. The ancient indigenous village system of India still exists in the hilly country adjacent to Bengal, but in the plains it has almost disappeared. The traces that remain are scanty; in some places village panch\u00e1yats or conferences exist, but they are being supplanted by municipal institutions, law courts, and the influence of the landlord. The village head-man has still, however, a recognised position in the rural community, although denuded of his authoritative powers. His functions are those of an arbitrator and general adviser; and the office is to a remarkable extent in the Bengal delta hereditary in low-caste families. In the Metropolitan District surrounding Calcutta, only 15 village head-men in 1872 belonged to high castes, 1300 to intermediate castes, and 3600 to low castes.\n\nCondition of the People.\u2014The Census of 1881 returned the number of the population engaged in each of the great branches of occupation as\nfollows. But the classification is evidently an unsatisfactory one, and must be accepted with reserve. Of the whole population of 69,536,861, as many as 46\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) millions are returned as 'unemployed.' These figures include all the children and all the women who have no specific employment besides their own household work. The number of unemployed females amounts to 30,466,119 out of a total female population of 34,911,270. Of the remaining 4\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) million females, almost 2 millions are employed in agricultural pursuits, and a slightly smaller number in manufactures and technical industry. Among the 34,625,591 males in Bengal, 15,830,331 are returned as unemployed, these being almost entirely children and old men. A nearly equal number (13,332,557) derive their income from land-ownership and cultivation; more than 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) millions are employed in manufactures and technical industry; rather more than a million belong to the commercial class; rather less than a million are in service; while the remainder (624,538) are professional men or Government employ\u00e9s.\n\nThe people of the eastern Districts of the Province are as a rule much better off than those in the western Districts. In the first place, the rate of wages is higher in the east, while food is generally cheaper; secondly, the pressure of the population on the soil is lighter, and rents are consequently lower in comparison to the productiveness of the soil and the remunerative character of such staples as jute, etc. In Districts to the west, however, where labour is cheap and land dear, the people emigrate to other parts of the country for temporary service and labour. Thus, the people of Behar, Orissa, and Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur especially every year send colonies into Bengal, besides furnishing labourers for the tea Districts. The emigration from Calcutta to countries beyond sea averages only 12,000 per annum.\n\nThe prices of common food differ much at the central marts and in the isolated tracts of the interior, being tolerably uniform in the former, but sometimes extraordinarily cheap in the latter. The increasing facilities for transport are tending to correct this; but prices are everywhere much higher than they used to be in former times. At present, in Bengal and Behar hamlets, a rupee will ordinarily purchase 20 to 25 sers (40 to 50 lbs.) of common rice, and in Orissa from 25 to 30 sers. During the last generation it would have purchased 40 sers, and in the generation before that, 60 sers and upwards. In Calcutta itself, prices of food are still dearer; there, a rupee will seldom purchase more than 16 sers of common rice. In Behar, however, maize and other cereals, besides rice, are consumed; and of these, a rupee will purchase as much as 35 sers. The wages of labour may be generally stated at 1 to 2 annas (1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d. to 3d.) a day in Behar, 2 annas (3d.) in Orissa, 3 annas (4\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d.) in Northern Bengal, 4 annas (6d.) in Central Bengal, 5 annas (7\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d.) in Eastern Bengal, and 4 to 6 annas (6d. to 9d.) in Calcutta.\nDuring the last generation, the rates ranged from 1 anna to 3 annas (1\u00bdd. to 4\u00bdd.), the lowest being the rate generally prevalent. On the whole, the wages of labour have risen in proportion to the prices of common food.\n\nThe indebtedness of the cultivators as a class is not so serious as it once was, but it still exists to a large extent. It is worst in Behar, less in Central and Western Bengal and in Orissa, and least in Eastern and Northern Bengal, where it has in places altogether disappeared. The ordinary rates of interest are as high as 2 pice in the rupee per month for money lent, equal to $37\\frac{1}{2}$ per cent. per annum; and 50 per cent. is usually paid as interest on rice advances. The security is the standing crop. The creditors are generally the village bankers; but often, also, the zamindars, or landholders. The loans are contracted partly for purchase of cattle and implements of husbandry, to some extent for law expenses, and largely for marriage ceremonies.\n\nAgriculture\u2014Rice.\u2014The chief products of the Province have been already summarised. The great staple crop is rice; of which there are three harvests in the year,\u2014the boro, or spring rice; aus, or autumn rice; and aman, or winter rice. Of these, the last or winter rice is by far the most extensively cultivated, and forms the great harvest of the year. This crop is grown on low land. In May or June, after the first fall of rain, a nursery ground is ploughed three times, and the seed scattered broadcast. When the seedlings make their appearance, another field is prepared for transplanting. By this time the rainy season has thoroughly set in, and the field is dammed up so as to retain the water. It is then repeatedly ploughed until the water becomes worked into the soil, and the whole reduced to thick mud. The young rice is next taken from the nursery, and transplanted in rows about 9 inches apart. If, by reason of the backwardness of the rains, the nursery ground cannot be prepared for the seed in April\u2013May\u2013June, the aman rice is not transplanted at all. In such a case, the husbandmen in June, July, or August soak the paddy in water for one day to germinate, and plant the germinated seed, not in a nursery plot, but in the larger fields, which they would otherwise have used to transplant the sprouts into. It is very seldom, however, that this procedure is found necessary. Aman rice is much more extensively cultivated than aus, and in favourable years is the most valuable crop; but being sown in low lands it is liable to be destroyed by excessive rainfall. The aman is reaped in November\u2013December\u2013January. Aus rice is generally sown in high ground. The field is ploughed, when the early rains set in, ten or twelve times over, till the soil is reduced nearly to dust, the seed being sown broadcast in April or May. As soon as the young plants reach 6 inches in height, the land is harrowed for the purpose of thinning the crop and to clear it of weeds. The crop is harvested in August or\nSeptember. *Boro*, or spring rice, is cultivated on low marshy land, being sown in a nursery in October, transplanted a month later, and harvested in March and April. An indigenous description of rice, called *uri* or *j\u00e1ra-dh\u00e1n*, grows in certain marshy tracts. The grain is very small, and is gathered for consumption only by the poorest. No tabulated statistics of cultivation exist; but in 1872\u201373, the quantity of rice exported from Bengal to foreign ports amounted to 288,955 tons, of the value of \u00a31,685,170; in 1881\u201382 the total export of rice by sea amounted to \u00a31,840,000 in value. These figures and the similar returns of the yield or exportation of Bengal products in 1881\u201382 have been supplied for this edition of the *Imperial Gazetteer* by the Bengal Government. They do not always agree with the general export returns from the Bengal ports. I reproduce the figures as officially furnished to me.\n\nOil-seeds are very largely grown over the whole of Bengal, particularly in the Behar Districts; their export by sea in 1881\u201382 exceeded 2\u00bd millions sterling. The principal oil-seeds are *sarish\u00e1* (mustard), *til* (sesamum), and *tisi* or *masin\u00e1* (linseed). Exports of oil-seeds are principally confined to linseed, of which 107,723 tons were exported in 1872\u201373, and 143,206 tons in 1881\u201382.\n\nJute.\u2014Jute (*p\u00e1t* or *kosht\u00e1*) now forms a very important commercial staple of Bengal. The cultivation of this crop has greatly increased during the past twenty-five years. Its principal seat of cultivation is Eastern Bengal, where the superior varieties are grown. The crop, which grows on either high or low lands, is sown in April, and cut in August. In 1872, the area under jute cultivation in Bengal was estimated at 925,899 acres, and the yield at 496,703 tons. Jute exports from Bengal amounted in 1881\u201382 to 414,054 tons, value \u00a35,548,839. Jute manufactures, in the shape of gunny-bags, cloth, rope, etc., were also exported to the value of \u00a31,097,589. The jute crop varies greatly from year to year. The sea-borne exports of the raw and manufactured article may be taken to average about 4\u00bd millions sterling, sometimes falling to below 3 millions and rising in bumper years to over 6 millions sterling.\n\nIndigo.\u2014Indigo cultivation is principally carried on with European capital. Notwithstanding the vicissitudes which it has encountered, it still forms one of the principal industries of the Province. In the Districts of Nadiy\u00e1 and Jessor, and throughout Central Bengal, in Purniah, and westwards in all Behar north of the Ganges, indigo is largely cultivated; and, from its mode of cultivation, it is in many places the staple which most engrosses the attention of the people. The indigo riots of 1859\u201360 were, however, followed by a marked decline in the cultivation of the plant throughout Bengal Proper. In some Districts, indeed, the manufacture became extinct, in consequence of the hostility of the cultivators; and although it has since shown a\ntendency to recover itself, the area under cultivation is less than it was twenty years ago; while the profits to be derived from the growth of jute, European vegetables, and valuable garden crops\u2014betel, chillies, ginger, turmeric, etc.\u2014render the r\u0101yats averse to entering into engagements with the indigo planters. The decline of indigo in Bengal Proper has, however, been almost counterbalanced in later years by its extension in Behar and in the North-Western Provinces, and especially by its cultivation by native capitalists. The annual out-turn of the Lower Provinces greatly varies, but is now hardly less than it was thirty years ago; it may be put down at rather more than 100,000 maunds, say from 3000 to 4500 tons, worth from 2 to 3\u00bd millions sterling. The total value of the indigo exported from Calcutta varied from 3\u00bd to 4\u00bd millions sterling during the ten years ending 1882. The crop of 1882 was above the average, the total exports from the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal amounting to 4595 tons, of the value of \u00a33,151,259.\n\nTwo crops of indigo are raised in the year,\u2014one sown in April or May before the setting in of the rains, and cut in August or September; the other sown in October as the waters subside, and cut in the following July.\n\nTea.\u2014Tea cultivation is the other great industry in Bengal carried on by European capital. It is produced principally in D\u0101rjiling and the Tar\u0101i, including Jalp\u0101iguri. The yield from these Districts in 1881\u201382 was 7,623,561 lbs. About 487,400 lbs. were grown and manufactured on the slopes of the Chittagong Hills in the same year; 4405 lbs. in Dacca, and 208,074 lbs. in the tea-growing Districts of Chuti\u0101 N\u0101gpur. The total approximate out-turn for the Province in 1881\u201382 was 8,323,440 lbs., derived from 283 gardens, with an area under plantation of 42,217 acres. D\u0101rjiling teas stand high in the home markets; and the manufacture is receiving more and more attention every year. A demand for Indian teas in the Australian market has given additional impetus to the industry of late years. The use of machinery is rapidly extending. The average yield of tea per acre of mature plantations is about 260 lbs. This amount, though falling short of the sanguine expectations of the first days of tea-planting, is under good local management remunerative; and the prices obtained show that the average quality of the tea is good. The industry is now on a prosperous and sound footing. There are evident signs, also, that the labour question has become more easy of solution. The D\u0101rjiling labourers are mostly Nep\u00e1l\u00eds. The total value of the tea exported from Calcutta (including up-country consignments) has risen steadily from 1\u00bd millions sterling in 1873 to 3\u00bd millions sterling in 1882.\n\nOpium.\u2014The cultivation of opium is a State monopoly, no person being allowed to grow the poppy except on account of Government.\nThe plant is successfully cultivated in the large Gangetic tract which extends from the borders of Oudh to Agra on the west, and to the District of Bh\u00e1galpur on the east. The manufacture is carried on at two separate agencies,\u2014that of Benares in the North-Western Provinces, of which the head station is at Gh\u00e1zipur; and that of Behar, with its head station at Patn\u00e1. Annual engagements are entered into by the cultivators, under a system of advances from Government, to sow a certain quantity of land with poppy; the whole produce in the form of opium is delivered to Government at a fixed rate. It is a principle to leave it optional with every cultivator to enter into such an engagement or not. The area under poppy cultivation in the Behar agency, situated entirely within Bengal, amounted in 1881\u201382 to 143,730 acres; in the Benares agency, to 139,922 acres,\u2014total, 283,652 acres. The number of chests of opium sold at the Government sales in Calcutta in 1881\u201382 was 56,400, the amount realized was \u00a37,465,313, and the net revenue, \u00a35,488,773. The annual sales of Bengal opium vary from 6 to 7\u00bd millions sterling, gross.\n\nCinchona.\u2014The cultivation of the cinchona plant in Bengal was introduced as an experiment about 1862, in a valley of the Him\u00e1layas in D\u00e1rjiling District; and the enterprise has already attained great success. In 1877, the total number of cinchona plants, cuttings, and seedlings was 3,817,192, which by 1882 had increased to upwards of five millions. The entire produce of the plantation in 1881\u201382 was 341,570 lbs. of dry bark. The quantity of the drug disposed of was 10,876 lbs., of which 4680 lbs. was sold to the public. The total revenue of the Government plantations in 1881\u201382 amounted to \u00a327,221 (inclusive of \u00a35982 realized from sales in London in 1880\u201381), against an expenditure of \u00a314,188, leaving a net profit of \u00a313,033. In order to properly estimate the value of these plantations to Government, however, it is necessary to note that in addition to this profit a large amount was saved by the substitution of this febrifuge for imports of quinine in hospitals and dispensaries. Besides the two Government plantations at Mangpu and Sittong in D\u00e1rjiling, there is a neighbouring garden belonging to a private company. For further particulars, see Darjiling District.\n\nForests.\u2014A scientific system of forest conservancy in Bengal was only started a few years ago, but remarkable progress has been already made by the Forest Department, both in putting a stop to the indiscriminate destruction of timber, and in an increase to the revenue. The area of Government \u2018reserved\u2019 forests, which in 1872\u201373 was only 156 square miles, had increased by 1881\u201382 to 4236 square miles; the surplus revenue of receipts over charges rose from \u00a35413 to \u00a323,912 in the same period. Besides reserved forest, there were also 2325 square miles of \u2018protected,\u2019 and 5108 square miles\nof 'unreserved' forest, bringing up the total area to 11,669 square miles.\n\nSystem of Land Tenures and Rent.\u2014The land revenue of Bengal and Behar is fixed under the Permanent Settlement, concluded by Lord Cornwallis in 1793. The Government, by abdicating its position as owner of the soil, and contenting itself with a permanent revenue charge on the land, freed itself from the labour and risks attendant upon a detailed local management. The land is held by zam\u012bnd\u0101rs, who pay their revenue direct to Government. In default of punctual payment of the revenue fixed upon the estates, these are liable to sale at public auction. Many of the zam\u012bnd\u0101rs have in their turn disposed of their zam\u012bnd\u0101r\u012bs to under-tenants. The practice of granting under-tenures\u2014permanent and temporary\u2014has steadily increased, until in many Districts only a small proportion of the whole permanently settled area remains in the direct possession of the zam\u012bnd\u0101rs. This process of sub-infeudation has not terminated with the patnidd\u0101rs (permanent tenure-holders) and ij\u0101r\u0101d\u0101rs (lease-holders). Lower gradations of sub-tenures under them, called dar-patnis and dar-ij\u0101r\u0101ts, and still lower subordinate tenures, have been created in great numbers. Such tenures and under-tenures often comprise defined tracts of land; but a common practice has been to sub-let certain aliquot shares of the whole superior tenure, the consequence of which is that the tenants in any particular village of an estate often pay their rents to many different landlords,\u2014a fraction, calculated at the rate of so many annas or pice in the rupee, to each. All the under-tenures in Bengal have not, however, been created since the Permanent Settlement. Dependent taluks, gaulis, h\u0101old\u0101s (hawd\u0101l\u0101s), and other similar fixed and transferable under-tenures existed before the Settlement, and their permanent character was recognised at the time. In addition to these numerous tenures, the country is dotted with small plots of land held revenue free; the great majority of them having been granted by former Governments, or by zam\u012bnd\u0101rs under those Governments, as religious endowments,\u2014grants which have been recognised and confirmed by the English Government.\n\nThe rates of rent paid by the cultivating tenant depend upon a variety of circumstances. There are rentals at the rate of 9d. an acre; there are rack-rents at the rate of 12s. an acre. There are r\u0101yats with a permanent interest in the soil, whose rent was fixed fifty years ago or even before the Permanent Settlement, and is now nominal and unalterable. There are r\u0101yats with a right of occupancy, whose rents are liable to enhancement only under certain conditions, and are therefore variable. There are tenants-at-will, whose rents are in many Districts at a rack-rate. There are tenants who cultivate their landlords' lands at a trifling rent, but whose actual profits are divided with the landlord.\nThere are tenants who have paid a quittance in money for their rents altogether; and there are tenants who pay at a lower rate than others in consideration of personal service, or from their being connected by family or marriage with their zamindar. In the indigo Districts a general concurrence has been established between the planters and their tenants that indigo plant shall count in favour of the latter in fixing the rent. The r\u0101y\u0101t who sows indigo compromises his dislike to that cultivation by paying a smaller rent for his land; the r\u0101y\u0101t who does not sow has to pay the full rate. It is notorious also that the zam\u012bnd\u0101r's r\u0101y\u0101ts pay, as a rule, a lower rate than the r\u0101y\u0101ts of an under-tenant. The rent law of the country has been codified, chiefly in Act x. of 1859 and Act viii. (Bengal Council) of 1869. As already mentioned, a Tenancy Bill, containing a revision of the Land Law of Bengal, is now (1884) before the Legislative Council of the Governor-General.\n\nGovernment Estates.\u2014Besides the zam\u012bnd\u0101ri lands, a considerable portion of the soil of Bengal is the private possession of Government, being managed under the direct agency of the District revenue authorities, or under special circumstances let out to a contractor upon a farming lease. The total number of these Government estates in 1881\u201382 was 44,376, with a current rent demand of \u00a3246,904. Hitherto the expenses of management of Government estates have been met by a lump assignment made annually from Imperial Funds. This arrangement was found inconvenient, and has now (1883) been abandoned in favour of a more methodical plan of a percentage on collections, whereby expenditure is proportioned to income. During 1881\u201382, the assignment for the management of Government estates amounted to \u00a318,000, although the actual expenditure somewhat exceeded this amount.\n\nWards' Estates.\u2014The management by the State of the landed properties of minors who are wards of Government, or adults incapacitated for the management of their own affairs, has been placed on a sound legal basis by Act iv. of 1870 (Bengal Council). On an average, this management comprises about 125 estates with an aggregate area of nearly 2 millions of acres, or 3300 square miles, and a rental of nearly three quarters of a million sterling per annum. The care of Government extends also to the minors themselves, for whom institutes were provided at Calcutta and Benares, where they received a good education suitable to their station. The institution at Calcutta has, however, been abolished, and a system, inaugurated in 1881, of educating the minors at the best local schools and colleges, is now on its trial.\n\nSurveys.\u2014The professional survey of Bengal has been almost entirely completed. It proves very valuable for the many administrative changes and improvements which are being carried out in the interior\nof the Districts. But the survey embraces only the exterior boundary of the lands of each village, and affords no details of cultivation or waste. In Bengal, therefore, we are almost destitute of professionally tested information regarding the incidence of the land tax, the pressure of rents, the average of cultivation to each husbandman or each plough, the average size of holdings, and the like. The enormous expense may possibly prevent a cadastral survey being attempted throughout Bengal, although this great enterprise is now contemplated for Behar. Meanwhile a re-survey of the alluvial tracts in the basins of the great rivers is periodically accomplished, in order to make allowance for the effects of the changes constantly taking place along the banks of rivers and on the adjacent lands.\n\nSettlements.\u2014In Bengal Proper and Behar the general Settlement is permanent, but a fraction of the revenue is derived from lands under temporary Settlement. These lands consist chiefly of alluvial accretions and Government estates. Orissa, with the exception of a few large estates, is under a temporary Settlement. In 1837, a thirty years' Settlement was concluded, which expired in 1867, but was renewed without alteration for another period of thirty years, owing to the distress left by the Orissa famine of 1866. That Settlement still remains in force.\n\nManufactures.\u2014Throughout Bengal there are the usual handicrafts, to supply local demand. Weaving and the spinning of cotton thread employ large numbers in every District; and, although the extensive import of piece-goods from England is driving the finer native fabrics out of the market, the decline appears to have been compensated by the increase of general trade. If the demand for the exquisite muslins of Dacca has been destroyed, native industry is still able to find profitable employment in weaving cloth of a stronger texture from English spun yarns. The growth of the jute trade has given an impetus to the manufacture of gunny-bags throughout the Eastern and Central Districts. The spinning and weaving of the fibre into cotton bales and grain and sugar bags, and its preparation in the raw state for exportation, afford occupation to thousands; while in Calcutta and its neighbourhood many mills are established, in working which the natives have displayed great aptitude. Carpenters, blacksmiths, goldsmiths, potters, and oil-sellers are settled in almost every village. The manufacture of the beads universally worn in necklaces by the lower orders of Hindus is a very common occupation, and one in which the women take a large share. The plaiting of wicker and basket work is the special occupation of the Dom class, a very low caste in Bengal. The native shoes are always made by Much\u00eds or Cham\u00e1rs, who have the monopoly also of all leather work. The sol\u00e1 weed which grows along with rice is manufactured by the gardener\ncaste into the sol\u00e1 hats or top\u00eds worn by Europeans, and into artificial flowers and ornaments for native ceremonies. Among the important manufactures of Bengal calling for special notice are indigo, tea, silk, sugar, and saltpetre. The two first have already been mentioned.\n\nSilk.\u2014The production of silk has long been an important industry. In the days of the East India Company, numerous large filatures, managed by the Company, did a valuable trade. The ruins of some of these may still be met with, and on the sites of others are seen new filatures belonging to the firms which succeeded to the Company\u2019s trade. The industry, once so flourishing, has, however, for some time been in a declining state. The extensive importation of silk from Japan and China into Europe since the opening of the Suez Canal, and the abundant yield of recent seasons in Italy, have contributed mainly to this falling off. But the quality of Bengal silk is also reported to have deteriorated. The annual value of the silk produce of Bengal is from half a million to \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) million sterling; average of ten years, 1867 to 1877, about 1 million. In 1882, the value of the raw silk exported from all India was only \u00a3141,700, together with \u00a3250,535 worth of silk-goods: total, under \u00a3400,000 sterling.\n\nSugar.\u2014The cultivation of the date-tree and the manufacture of date sugar are extensively carried on in Jessur, and in parts of Nadiy\u00e1, the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, and Far\u00eddpur. It is a popular and profitable business for the cultivators. The value of the sugar exported from Jessur District alone is about \u00a3160,000, almost entirely, however, for inland consumption. The average yearly exports by sea from Bengal do not exceed \u00a3150,000.\n\nSaltpetre.\u2014Saltpetre is refined in the northern Districts of the Patn\u00e1 Division in Behar. Like all branches of industry in India, its manufacture is based on a system of advances. The large houses of business contract generally with middlemen, who again give advances to the village nuniy\u00e1s, a poor and hardy race of labourers. These men rent small patches of saliferous soil, collect the earth into large shallow pans, puddle them and drain off the water, with the saline matter in it, into earthen vessels, and then boil and strain the liquor. The crude saltpetre thus manufactured is sold to the refiners, by whom is prepared the saltpetre of commerce. The value of the annual out-turn is about \u00a3400,000.\n\nSteam-mills.\u2014The most remarkable manufacturing feature of the present time is the great development, in the neighbourhood of Calcutta, of steam mills for the spinning and weaving of cotton and jute in establishments of a European character under European management. There were in 1882, 20 large jute factories in and around Calcutta; and the tall smoking chimneys recall associations of the manufacturing cities of Europe. It is estimated that the annual\nconsumption of jute, by 5263 looms at work, is not less than 100,000 tons, and that the total value of the annual production of the mills is about \u00a32,600,000. It does not seem probable that cotton-spinning by machinery will attain to equal proportions in Bengal. There are, however, seven cotton factories near Calcutta, employing 85,334 spindles or throstles.\n\nInternal Trade.\u2014The position of the classes engaged in trade and commerce in Bengal is very prosperous. The boat trade on the rivers is, for magnitude and variety, quite unique in India. Some of these country craft, with their strong gear and equipment and their skilled navigators, face the wind, storms, and waves of the estuaries of the great rivers, and will, under sail, carry a heavy cargo against the current; others, again, can only ply in the sheltered creeks and channels which spread their network over the country. In Eastern Bengal every husbandman keeps his boat, just as in other countries he keeps his cart. The registration which, prior to January 1878, was carefully carried on at some river-side stations, disclosed authoritatively the vast extent of the traffic on the navigable highways. Since the beginning of 1878, a change in the system of registration has been introduced, and the whole of the traffic coming into and going from Calcutta is now tabulated by a cordon of stations round the city, and by the different railways and river steamers. The import trade into Calcutta from the interior (exclusive of opium and railway materials) in 1881-82 was valued at \u00a339,071,119. Goods to the value of 11 millions sterling came by country boats, 3\u00bd millions by river steamers, 14\u00bd millions by the East Indian Railway, 6 millions by the Eastern Bengal Railway, \u00a390,000 by the Calcutta and South-Eastern State Railway, and 3\u00be millions by road. The principal imports are\u2014rice, \u00a33,060,000; tea, \u00a33,680,000; jute, \u00a35,670,000; indigo, \u00a32,970,000; linseed, \u00a31,830,000; mustard seed, \u00a3980,000; wheat, \u00a32,830,000; and silk, \u00a31,040,000.\n\nThe landward export trade from Calcutta into the interior of the country in the same year amounted to an estimated value of \u00a327,841,540. Goods to the value of 4\u00bc millions were exported by country boats, \u00a3136,000 by river steamers, 15\u00be millions by the East Indian Railway, 4 millions by the Eastern Bengal Railway, \u00a314,000 by the Calcutta and South-Eastern Railway, and \u00a31,748,000 by road. The most important exports are\u2014European cotton piece-goods, 13\u00bd millions; salt, \u00a33,510,000; and European cotton twist, \u00a31,284,000. The largest rice-supplying Districts, arranged in the order of their importance, are\u2014B\u00e1karganj, the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, Bardw\u00e1n, Midnapur, Din\u00e1jpur, B\u00edrbh\u00fam and H\u00fagl\u00ed. Nearly half of the wheat brought to Calcutta for export comes from the North-Western Provinces, the principal Bengal producing Districts being\u2014Patn\u00e1, Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, Bh\u00e1galpur, Monghyr, S\u00e1ran,\nSant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s, Nadiy\u00e1, Maldah, and Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d. The principal jute-supplying Districts are\u2014Far\u00eddpur, Pabn\u00e1, Dacca, Rangpur, 24 Pargan\u00e1s, Maimansingh, R\u00e1jsh\u00e1h\u00ed, Nadiy\u00e1, H\u00fagl\u00ed, and Jalpaiguri. Linseed is principally exported from Behar; mustard seed from the North-Western Provinces and Behar, as well as from the Eastern Bengal District of Maimansingh, and the District of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1ra within the Assam borders.\n\nAbout \u00a38,330,000 worth of European cotton piece-goods are consumed within the territories under the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal. The average consumption is at the rate of about two shillings and sixpence per head. The consumption is largest in Eastern Bengal, where the prosperity of the people is greatest. This part of the country stands first in the export of rice, jute, and oil-seeds, and also imports the largest quantity of commodities from Europe. In Western Bengal the consumption is less; it is a country of weavers, and the supply of native-made cloth is great. In Orissa, native weavers still retain their old position, and the supply of European piece-goods is comparatively small. The statistics show that the consumption of salt among the population is at the rate of $10\\frac{1}{4}$ lbs. per head. In regard to salt also, the consumption is highest in Eastern Bengal, being 11 lbs. 15 oz. per head; then come the Western and Central Districts, both above $10\\frac{1}{2}$ lbs. per head. There is no insufficiency in the consumption except in Behar, where a quantity of salt extracted in the manufacture of saltpetre passes into local use, and so displaces duty-paying salt that would otherwise have been consumed by the people. A large part of the local trade of Bengal is in the hands of natives from other Provinces of India, and the enterprising M\u00e1rw\u00e1r\u00eds in particular have established firms in all the important commercial centres. Generally speaking, the native traders do not resort to the railway with the same confidence as Europeans. Bulky merchandise, such as rice, oil-seeds, jute, and salt, is for the most part financed for by native agents, and still prefers the old river routes. But the tendency to use the railway is rapidly on the increase.\n\nThe foreign trade of Bengal is brisk and flourishing. For many years past the exportation of raw produce has been exercising a progressive influence on the condition of the peasantry. It enables them to get increased returns for their labour, whereby they can afford to lodge, feed, and clothe themselves better than formerly, and to fill their dwellings with superior implements and furniture. New wants have arisen in proportion as the means of supplying them are augmented, together with a spirit of self-reliance and a disposition to appreciate and assert the rights which pertain to the tillers of the soil. The value of the trade of the several Bengal ports, including the imports and exports of all merchandise and treasure, both in the trade with\nforeign countries and in the interportal trade, was as follows for 1881-82:\u2014Calcutta, \u00a364,634,509; Chittagong, \u00a31,214,442; Orissa Ports, \u00a3989,748; Narayanganj, \u00a3573,920: total, \u00a367,412,619. Of this grand total, \u00a340,181,529 are exports; \u00a327,231,090 are imports. The total trade of Calcutta alone was \u00a338,894,876 exports; \u00a325,739,633 imports. Of the export trade, 15\u00bd millions sterling were sent to Great Britain; 6\u00be millions to China; 2\u00bc millions to the United States; and more than 1 million to the Straits Settlements, France, and Ceylon. The most important exports are\u2014opium, \u00a37,473,857; jute, \u00a34,581,543; indigo, \u00a33,151,259; oil-seeds, \u00a32,520,682; tea, \u00a33,528,771; hides and skins, \u00a31,830,674; and rice, \u00a31,844,516. In 1875-76, the value of wheat exported was \u00a3398,970, but it has since increased to above 2\u00bd millions sterling in value. In the import trade, the main items are\u2014cotton piece-goods, \u00a311,430,965; metals, \u00a31,734,191; and machinery, \u00a3488,539. Of the imports, 18\u00bd millions are from the United Kingdom. The export trade of Chittagong and of the Orissa Ports consists almost entirely of rice, carried in coasting vessels. Chittagong imports salt direct from Liverpool, and exports some jute; but otherwise these minor ports have scarcely any direct trade with Europe.\n\nThe Ganges, the Brahmaputra, and on a much smaller scale the Mahanadi river in Orissa, with the Eastern Bengal Railway, the Northern Bengal Railway, and the great East Indian Line, form the main arteries of commerce. From these great channels a network of minor streams, and a not yet complete system of raised roads, radiate to the remotest Districts. The larger transactions of commerce are conducted in the cities, such as Calcutta and Patna, and in large rural marts, which have recently grown up under British rule. The smaller operations of trade are effected by means of village markets and countless h\u00e2ts or open-air weekly bazaars in every District.\n\nRoads.\u2014During 1881-82, the expenditure from Provincial funds on the main lines of road in the Province was \u00a3211,525, including the expenditure on six new and important feeder roads for the Northern Bengal State Railway. The construction of these feeder lines, although intended to be left to the local Committees, had to be taken in hand by the Public Works Department, as it was found that many years must elapse before the funds at the disposal of the Committees would enable them to effect any appreciable improvement in the communications between the railway stations and the local trade centres. The operations of the District Committees are primarily directed to the maintenance of existing roads, and most Districts are now provided with fairly good local roads. As a rule, a considerable proportion of the funds of the Committees is set aside for the construction or improvement of village tracks, works which bring home to the people\nmore clearly than larger undertakings the benefits which they receive for their contributions to the road cess. The construction and repairs of bridges, culverts, etc., absorbs the balance of the District road fund. The outlay on District roads in 1881-82 amounted to \u00a3489,701. Total on main and District roads, nearly three-quarters of a million sterling.\n\nRailways.\u2014Railway communication in Bengal has, of late years, been developed by a system of Provincial State Lines. In 1874, excluding the guaranteed (now Imperial) line of the East Indian Railway, and the guaranteed line of the Eastern Bengal Railway (both of which will be described below), there were only 55 miles of Provincial Railways open in Bengal, with a capital outlay of \u00a3769,000. At the end of 1881-82, the total of these Provincial Railways was 529 miles completed and opened, at an outlay of \u00a34,050,000; 309 miles in course of construction; 780 more miles had been surveyed, and 800 miles were further projected. The financial result to Government has proved satisfactory. In 1875, the net earnings of the Bengal Provincial Railways, less working expenses, were \u00a33805; in 1880-81 they amounted to \u00a3140,200. The following is a brief notice of each of the lines of railway actually working or under construction:\u2014(1) The East Indian Railway. This great line runs through Bengal by two main routes. Leaving Howrah, opposite to Calcutta, the line runs north-west, till, after passing Bardw\u00e1n, it divides into two branches; one known as the loop line turning to the north, and generally following the right bank of the Ganges; while the second or chord line takes a comparatively straight cut north-west across country, till it rejoins the loop-line at Lakhisar\u00e1i. The united line thence proceeds along the right bank of the Ganges, till it leaves Bengal near Baxar in Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d District, and enters the North-Western Provinces. Total length of the East Indian Railway and branches in Bengal, 704 miles, broad gauge. (2) Eastern Bengal Railway. This line starts from S\u00e1ldah, just outside Calcutta, and runs in a north and north-easterly direction to the bank of the Ganges or Padda at Goal\u00e1nda, with a short branch from Poradah to Damukdiha, in connection with the Northern Bengal State Railway; total length of line open, 172 miles, broad gauge. (3) The Northern Bengal State Railway, a metre-gauge line, running from S\u00e1ra, opposite to the Damukdiha terminus of the Eastern Bengal Railway on the other side of the river, northwards to Siligur\u00ed, at the base of the Sub-Him\u00e1layas. This line has a length of 245 miles, and is worked at a fair profit. In 1881-82, the gross earnings amounted to \u00a3192,868, and the working expenses to \u00a396,218, leaving a net profit of \u00a396,650, equal to an interest of 4\u00b761 per cent. on the capital outlay. (4) The D\u00e1rjiling Himalayan Railway continues, on a two-feet gauge, the railway from Siligur\u00ed to D\u00e1rjiling.\nThis hill line, commenced as a private enterprise in April 1879, was completed throughout its length of 49 miles in July 1881. During its first half-year's working, the line returned a profit of receipts over expenditure of \u00a36737, equal to interest at 4\u00b729 per cent. on its capital, and exceeding the Government guaranteed rate. (5) The Kaunia-Dharla and Mughal H\u00e1t Railway consists of local extensions of the Northern Bengal State Railway from Parbatipur to Dhubri in Goalp\u00e1r\u00e1 District of Assam, and to a village on the Kuch Behar road. (6) The T\u00edrh\u00fat State Railway, on the metre gauge, extends from Barh on the main line of the East Indian Railway to the right bank of the Ganges, which is crossed by a ferry, and the line continues northwards to Darbhangah, with a branch stretching north-westwards to Muzaffarpur. Length open in 1881-82, 85 miles; gross receipts, \u00a361,215; expenditure, \u00a335,155; net surplus, \u00a326,060, or 4\u00b765 per cent. on the capital expended. (7) The Patn\u00e1 and Gay\u00e1 State Railway is a broad-gauge line, running south to Gay\u00e1 town, a distance of 57 miles. Gross earnings in 1881-82, \u00a354,819; expenditure, \u00a334,241, leaving a net surplus of \u00a320,578, equal to an interest of 5\u00b734 per cent. on the capital. (8) The N\u00e1lh\u00e1ti State Railway, a four-foot gauge line, runs from the N\u00e1lh\u00e1ti Station on the loop line of the East Indian for 27 miles to Azimganj. It yielded in 1881-82 a surplus of \u00a31280, or a return of 3\u00b784 per cent. on its capital. The railway works, which were under construction at the end of 1881-82, but which have been completed since that year, are\u2014(1) An extension of the Calcutta and South-Eastern State Railway, from Champ\u00e1h\u00e1ti to Diamond Harbour on the H\u00fagl\u00ed, 28\u00bd miles. (2) Extensions of the Muzaffarpur Branch of the T\u00edrh\u00fat State Railway to Bettia and Pipr\u00e1-gh\u00e1t, 102 miles. (3) Extension of the Northern Bengal State Railway to Din\u00e1jpur, 20 miles. (4) Small branch railway from Baidyan\u00e1th, on the East Indian chord line, to Deogarh, a celebrated place of Jain pilgrimage, 6 miles. (5) Bengal Central Railway to Jessore and Khuln\u00e1, 129 miles (just opened, February 1884). An extension of the T\u00edrh\u00fat Railway is under construction to Simuri\u00e1, opposite Mok\u00e1ma. Besides the lines enumerated above, there were 6 other separate lines, or extensions of existing lines, which were under survey at the end of 1881-82, and 11 other projected lines were under the consideration of Government. When the system is complete, the over-peopled Districts of Bengal will be brought into speedy and cheap communication with the uninhabited or sparsely populated tracts of Assam on the one side and of the fertile Chhatisgarh plateau on the other. The total length of railways in the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal at present open (March 1884) may be taken at between 1600 and 1700 miles.\n\nAmong other projects in hand is the construction of a railway bridge across the H\u00fagl\u00ed, connecting the East Indian Railway with the Eastern\nBengal line on the Calcutta side of the river, so as to avoid the present cost of transhipment. A pontoon bridge already connects Howrah with Calcutta, but this is only suitable for passenger and cart traffic. After much discussion, a site for the railway bridge was selected about 23 miles north of Calcutta, near the town of H\u00fagl\u00ed; the connecting branch railway running from the H\u00fagl\u00ed station of the East Indian Railway to the Naih\u00e1ti station of the Eastern Bengal Railway, a distance of $3\\frac{3}{4}$ miles. The bridge, when completed, will present an imposing appearance, and the design is a novel one. The estimate for the bridge alone, exclusive of the approaches, amounts to \u00a3353,700, of which the iron-work, machinery, etc., will cost \u00a3125,000. The site selected for the bridge is a narrow reach of the river, where the main stream flows under the right bank. The depth of the main channel varies according to the season from 65 to 70 feet. The depth of water at the site of the two central piers is 24 and 36 feet below low-water mark, and it is intended that these piers should be sunk to a depth of 60 feet below the bed of the river. For steamer navigation, a clear headway of 35 feet above extreme flood level is proposed to be given. The bridge will be altogether 2100 feet in length, and will consist of a central double cantilever girder, 320 feet long, resting on two piers placed 120 feet apart in the middle of the channel; of two main girders, each 440 feet in length, and each weighing 1400 tons, one on each side of the central girder; and of two masonry viaducts, each 450 feet in length, extending inland from each shore abutment. A roadway, 26 feet wide, for a double line of rails is also provided, the extreme breadth from outside to outside of the main girders being $35\\frac{1}{2}$ feet. The wrought-iron caissons for the foundations of the central piers will be 66 feet long by 25 feet broad, with semi-circular ends. The girders are to be all of steel. No provision has been made for a footway outside the girders for foot passengers. The construction of the bridge was commenced in 1882, but a date cannot yet be assigned for its completion.\n\nCanals.\u2014The canals, navigable and for irrigation purposes, in Bengal are divided into three circles,\u2014the Orissa, South-Western, and Son,\u2014each of which forms a distinct system of its own. At the close of 1881\u201382, there were in operation in Bengal, 456 miles of navigable canal, 210 miles of canal for irrigation only, and 1943 miles of distributing channels, from which 1,326,868 acres can be irrigated. The capital invested in canals classed as productive works amounted at the close of 1881\u201382 to \u00a35,245,798. The total expenditure, imperial and provincial, incurred in the irrigation branch of the Public Works Department was \u00a3559,335.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The Civil Service is divided into two classes\u2014the Covenanted and Uncovenanted. The former includes civil servants\nwho have entered into a formal covenant with the Secretary of State for India. These superior officers were formerly nominated by the Court of Directors, and passed through Haileybury; they are now selected by special open competitive examination held yearly in London. The Uncovenanted Civil Service includes all other civilians under Government employ.\n\nThe unit of the executive administration is the Magistrate and Collector, known as 'The District Officer.' The Superintendent of Police is the right hand of the Magistrate in the suppression of crime. The District jails, although placed in the hands of an officer selected for the duty, usually the Civil Surgeon, are under the general control of the Magistrate. A similar arrangement has been carried into effect in regard to schools and the Department of Education. All District officers are, *ex officio*, Registrars of deeds. The District Officer is practically the executive chief and administrator of the tract of country committed to him. At his disposal are the subordinate magisterial, police, and revenue authorities. The Sub-divisional officers, who are Assistant and Deputy Magistrates in charge of divisions of Districts, exercise within their own jurisdiction the delegated authority of the District Officer. The Sub-deputies and the Sub-divisional establishments are the agents of the superior executive officers. Above the District Magistrates are the Commissioners of Divisions. Their duties are to supervise the District Officers, and to act as channels of communication between the local officers and Government, bringing together in a compact form the information which they receive.\n\nThe management of the whole is firmly concentrated in a single man, the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, who is answerable to the Government of India. His responsibility is divided by no executive council, as in Madras or Bombay. All orders issue through his secretaries in his own name; and although his policy is subject to the watchful control of the Government of India, represented by the Viceroy, yet to the Lieutenant-Governor personally belongs the honour or disgrace of a successful or an inglorious administration. In making laws for his people, he is assisted by a Legislative Council, composed partly of his principal officers, and partly of leading members of the non-official European and Native communities. In his legislative, as in his executive functions, a power of control, amounting if needful to veto, rests with the Governor-General\u2014a power which, by reason of the English talent for harmonious proconsular rule, is very seldom exercised.\n\nMunicipal and local self-government is now beginning to play an important part in Bengal. The Bill at present (1884) before the Bengal Legislative Council will give a further extension to municipal institutions, and to the powers exercised by non-official delegates of the people in these bodies. Practically a great mechanism of popular\nadministration, which has for some years been working in an experimental manner, will now be organised under the supervision of the officers of Government, but consisting in a large measure of representative and elective elements.\n\nBengal is divided into Regulation Districts, whose advanced state has rendered it expedient to place them under the complete system of Anglo-Indian law; and non-Regulation Districts, in which this has not yet been found practicable. The latter contain territories of three distinct classes. The first of them consists, for the most part, of newly-acquired territory, to which the general Regulations have never been extended in their entirety. The second, of tracts inhabited by primitive races specially exempted from the operation of the Regulations, and to whom a less formal code of law is better adapted. The third, of semi-independent or tributary States, administered or partly administered by British officers; but whether these semi-independent States legally form part of British India is a moot point.\n\nCriminal justice is administered by the High Court at Calcutta, the District Courts of Sessions, and the Courts of Magistrates. In respect of civil justice, the High Court of Calcutta exercises original and appellate powers, together with an ecclesiastical, an admiralty, and a bankruptcy jurisdiction. Below the High Court are the District and Additional Judges, the Small Cause Court and Subordinate Judges, and the Munstifs, who are all Civil Judges.\n\nRevenue and Expenditure.\u2014The finances of Bengal are now arranged under four great heads\u2014imperial, provincial, local, and municipal. The total gross revenue under all these branches for 1881\u201382 was \u00a319,824,888; thus\u2014imperial, \u00a314,900,981; provincial, \u00a33,762,149; local, \u00a3557,318; municipal (including Calcutta), \u00a3604,440. The principal heads of revenue were\u2014land revenue, \u00a33,781,103; opium, \u00a37,535,893; salt, \u00a32,483,613; excise, \u00a3937,392; customs, \u00a3830,727; and stamps, \u00a31,202,392. The principal heads of expenditure were\u2014opium cultivation, \u00a32,054,368; law and justice (judicial courts), \u00a3696,823; administration, \u00a3147,185; land revenue, \u00a3310,209; police, \u00a3408,658; education, \u00a3277,648; and public works (excluding capital expenditure on reproductive public works), \u00a31,345,225.\n\nThe table on the following page exhibits the net revenue and expenditure of the Province of Bengal (exclusive of the municipal revenue and expenditure of Calcutta) for the year 1881\u201382.\n\nOf the different sources of revenue, the land revenue, excise, and stamps are managed by the District Collector and his establishments; the opium, customs, and salt revenue are under special departments. The Collector is controlled by the Commissioner of the Division, who again is subject to the orders of the Board of Revenue.\n\n[Sentence continued on p. 319.]\n## NET REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE OF THE LIEUTENANT-GOVERNORSHIP OF BENGAL FOR THE YEAR 1881\u201382.\n\n| NET REVENUE | \u00a3       |\n|-------------|---------|\n| Land Revenue, |         |\n| Forest, |         |\n| Excise on Spirits and Drugs, |         |\n| Assessed Taxes, |         |\n| Provincial Rates, |         |\n| Customs, |         |\n| Salt, |         |\n| Opium, |         |\n| Stamps, |         |\n| Registration, |         |\n| Minor Departments, |         |\n| Law and Justice, |         |\n| Police, |         |\n| Marine, |         |\n| Education, |         |\n| Medical, |         |\n| Stationery and Printing, |         |\n| Interest, |         |\n| Receipts in Aid of Superannuation, Retired and Compensate Allowances, |         |\n| Miscellaneous, |         |\n| State Railways, |         |\n| Irrigation and Navigation, |         |\n| Other Public Works, |         |\n| Gain by Exchange, |         |\n\n| NET EXPENDITURE | \u00a3       |\n|-----------------|---------|\n| Interest on Funded and Unfunded Debt, |         |\n| Interest on Service Funds and other Accounts, |         |\n| Civil and Political Salaries and Establishments, |         |\n| Civil and Political Contingencies, |         |\n| Judicial Charges, |         |\n| Police, |         |\n| Marine, |         |\n| Education, |         |\n| Stationery and Printing, |         |\n| Civil Furlough and Absentee Allowances, |         |\n| Superannuation, Retired and Compassionate Allowances, |         |\n| Miscellaneous, |         |\n| Franchise Relief, |         |\n| State Railways, |         |\n| Irrigation and Navigation, |         |\n| Other Public Works, |         |\n| Loss by Exchange on transactions in London, |         |\n| Interest, |         |\n| Receipts in Aid of Superannuation, Retired and Compensate Allowances, |         |\n| Miscellaneous, |         |\n| State Railways, |         |\n| Irrigation and Navigation, |         |\n| Other Public Works, |         |\n| Gain by Exchange, |         |\n\n| Total, |         |\n| Municipalties, |         |\n| Local Funds, |         |\n| Total, |         |\n| Grand Total, |         |\n| Less Allowances and Assignments payable under Treaties and Engagements, |         |\n| Net Total, |         |\n\n* Excluding Calcutta Municipality.\n\n\u00a336,149\n\u00a323,075\n\u00a3404,812\n\u00a395,662\n\u00a388,558\n\u00a3408,659\n\u00a3105,500\n\u00a3277,488\n\u00a3229,322\n\u00a32,782\n\u00a395,100\n\u00a335,272\n\u00a33,866\n\u00a3303,447\n\u00a3369,023\n\u00a3675,755\n\u00a3119\n\n\u00a34,213,625\n\u00a3140,457\n\u00a3564,434\n\u00a34,948,516\nThis Board consists of two members, each of whom exercises full powers in his own department: one devoting his attention to the land revenue, the second to all other sources of revenue. The opium branch of the revenue is under the management of two opium agents\u2014one stationed at Patna and the other at Ghazipur; but although the latter station lies in the North-Western Provinces, both the agents are subordinate to the Government of Bengal. They are aided by a local staff of assistants and sub-deputy agents. At the head of the Customs is a special Collector. The minor custom-houses at Chittagong and Orissa are under the control of the District Officers.\n\nIt is scarcely too much to say that, so long as the British power retains the port of Calcutta and the rich Provinces under the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, it would have sufficient revenue to effect the re-conquest of India if any accident should happen in the Punjab or North-West. But the vast income which the Lower Provinces yield is not altogether derived from their own people. China yearly contributes to it about $7\\frac{1}{2}$ millions in the shape of opium duty, and the inland parts of India contribute over a third of a million to the customs of Bengal. Taking the average thus obtained from other territories and from tributes at under 8 millions, the population subject to the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal pays, in imperial, provincial, local, and municipal taxation, nearly 12 millions sterling gross, or about three shillings and sixpence a head.\n\n**Military Force.**\u2014The army employed in the territories under the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal numbered in 1881-82 only 7875 officers and men, exclusive of a regiment of Madras Native Infantry 720 strong, stationed at Cuttack in Orissa; making a gross total of troops in Bengal of about 8500 men. Of this small force about 4000 are massed in Calcutta and its environs, with a view to their proximity to the seaboard, rather than with an eye to the internal requirements of the country; about 4000 guard the frontiers, with detachments on the lines of railway, which now form the great highways of Bengal. Taking 8500 as the total military force stationed in Bengal, 2800 consist of European troops and English officers, and 5700 of Native officers and men. The Government is a purely civil one, and the existence of any armed force is as little realized as in the quietest districts of England. Of the 69$\\frac{1}{2}$ millions of people under the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, probably 40 millions go through life without once seeing the gleam of a bayonet or the face of a soldier.\n\n**Police, and Criminal and Civil Justice.**\u2014Internal order and protection for person and property are secured by a large body of police. This force consists of two elements: a regular constabulary introduced by the English Government, and an indigenous police developed out of\nthe rural watch of the ancient Hindu commonwealth, and paid by grants of land, or by the villagers and landowners. In 1881\u201382, the strength of the regular police in Bengal was 78 superior officers, and 17,669 inferior officers and men. To these must be added the municipal police\u2014returned at 6073\u2014total, 23,820. The village watchmen are not under regular police control, although they discharge police duties. The total number of village watchmen in Bengal is put down at 183,641; and the cost of their support, which is defrayed by the villagers, is estimated at \u00a3589,634. The total number of persons brought to trial during the year 1881 was 217,964. Of these, 67,498 were discharged without trial or were acquitted, and 147,210 were convicted; 228 persons were found guilty of murder, 203 of culpable homicide, and 135 of d\u0101k\u0101t\u012b or gang robbery. The commonest offences are theft, 12,102 convictions; and assault, 12,803 convictions. The daily average prison population was 16,747, of whom 664 were women. These figures show 1 prisoner always in jail to every 4150 of the population, and 1 woman in jail to every 52,577 of the female population. The jail death-rate was 6\u00b765 per cent. The total number of civil suits disposed of in 1881 was 414,346; of these, 144,587 were suits for money, etc., and 149,119 rent suits.\n\nEducation.\u2014The number of scholars in all the schools supported, aided, or inspected by Government was, in 1881\u201382, a little over a million, or 11 per cent. of the children of a school-going age, assumed at 10 millions. The standard of instruction is virtually determined by the standard fixed in the examinations for scholarships. There are about 1200 scholarships annually divided between the primary, secondary, and superior schools. The grant-in-aid principle is generally in force. With few exceptions, the whole of the primary and secondary schools, and a large portion of the superior schools and colleges, are aided or private institutions, receiving a subsidy from the State on the condition of conforming to certain rules and submitting to Government inspection. The eight Government colleges and the normal schools are the only purely Government institutions in Bengal. In 1881\u201382, out of a total expenditure of \u00a3641,200 on education, \u00a3265,000 was paid by the State, and \u00a3376,200 by the people. The primary schools had 880,937 scholars, or about 80 per cent. of the whole. These elementary institutions are almost entirely developed out of the indigenous schools of the country, and give the education which the people themselves had found most suitable long before the British Government took the task of popular instruction in hand. The primitive teaching of the old indigenous school is imparted in an improved form and of a better quality, in our elementary schools. But it has been the aim of the Bengal Government to develope public instruction on the basis of the indigenous institutions; and to improve those institutions without superseding\nthem. The schools of secondary instruction were 1894 in number, with 141,095 scholars. At the head of these stand the zili or District schools, established by Government at the head-quarters of each District. In them candidates are prepared for the matriculation examination of the University of Calcutta. The University is, strictly speaking, an imperial rather than a provincial institution, as it exercises functions over the whole of the Bengal Presidency; but its seat is in Calcutta, and the majority of its students belong to the Lower Provinces. Its function is to examine and confer degrees. The students for degrees must study at certain affiliated colleges, of which there are six in the interior of Bengal\u2014at Patna, Dacca, Cuttack, Hugli, Rajshahi, and Krishnagarh. In Calcutta, two Government and four private colleges receive grants-in-aid from the State.\n\nNewspapers.\u2014In 1881\u201382, there were 13 principal newspapers published in the vernacular, and about 38 of less importance, some of them merely broadsheets, or 51 in all; but the number is constantly changing. The circulation of the 13 principal vernacular papers is believed to aggregate 7900 copies, that of the lesser papers about 11,700 copies. Apart from advertising sheets, there were 16 newspapers published in English within the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal in 1881, with an aggregate circulation of 15,000 copies. Of this circulation, about two-thirds are assigned to the Calcutta daily papers, The Englishman, The Indian Daily News, The Statesman, and The Indian Mirror. A weekly paper, The Hindu Patriot, conducted by native gentlemen, but printed in English, also deserves special mention. The Calcutta Review is a high-class quarterly, to which many of the leading Indian administrators, soldiers, and statesmen have contributed during the past half-century.\n\nClimate.\u2014Although Bengal is, for the most part, situated outside the tropical zone, its climate to the south of the Himalayas is characteristically tropical. The mean temperature of the whole year varies between 80\u00b0 F. in Orissa and 74\u00b0 in parts of Assam; that of Calcutta being 79\u00b0. In the hill station of Darjiling, with an elevation of 6685 feet above sea level, the mean temperature is about 54\u00b0, and occasionally falls as low as 24\u00b0 in the winter. In the annual range of their temperature, as well as in point of humidity and rainfall, the eastern and western portions of the Province are strongly contrasted. In Cachar, nearly 200 miles from the sea, the mean temperature of June is 82\u00b0, that of January 64.5\u00b0; and the highest and lowest temperatures recorded in a period of 5 years, namely 99\u00b0 and 43\u00b0, show a range of 56\u00b0. At Chittagong, on the sea-coast, the range does not exceed 49\u00b0. On the other hand, Patna, with a mean temperature of 87.2\u00b0 in June, and 60.7\u00b0 in January, registered in 1869 a maximum temperature of 116.3\u00b0 in May, and a minimum of 36.9\u00b0 in January, giving an absolute\nrange of 79\u00b04'. The highest recorded temperature in Calcutta is 106\u00b0, and the lowest 52\u00b08'; giving an extreme range of 53\u00b0. During the rains the temperature of the Hazaribagh plateau, to the west of the Delta, falls more rapidly than that of any other part of Bengal. Between May and October, the fall at Hazaribagh is rather over 11\u00b0, while at Berhampur, in about the same latitude, it is only about 4\u00bd\u00b0, and at Calcutta little more than 3\u00b0. The excessive humidity of the atmosphere in Bengal, especially in the eastern Districts, has become proverbial. It is greatest on the coast of Orissa and the Sundarbans, and diminishes inland as the distance from the sea increases. The Districts of Eastern Bengal, including Cachar and Sylhet, and the Himalayan tarai, are those of the heaviest rainfall. The average annual fall throughout those Districts amounts to over 100 inches, and on the exposed hill flanks and at their foot, this amount is greatly exceeded. Thus, Sylhet has an annual average of 141 inches; Darjiling, 126 inches; Baxa, 280 inches; and Chara Punji, 527 inches, the highest average rainfall hitherto recorded in the world. The rainfall is also higher along the coast than on the inland plains. Thus, Sagar island, at the mouth of the Hugli, has an average of 80 inches, and Calcutta only 66; False Point 74 inches, and Cuttack only 52\u00bd inches. The lowest rainfall is in the south of Behar, where the annual fall does not much exceed 40 inches. North of the Ganges, it increases gradually up to the Himalayas; and from the southern bank, the rainfall rises by degrees, up to the high ridge of forest-clad country drained by the Son, the Damodar, and their tributaries. In Calcutta, the highest rainfall recorded is that of 1871, when it amounted to 93\u00b031 inches; in 1837, the registered fall was as low as 43\u00b061 inches. By far the greater part of the rainfall occurs between June and October. Showers fall also in the hot weather months, and hailstorms are not infrequent in February and March. In the Eastern Districts rain occurs occasionally in the cold weather, but is less common in the Delta and the Districts of western Bengal.\n\nMedical Aspects; Vital Statistics.\u2014Apart from the large hospitals in the city of Calcutta, charitable medical relief was afforded in 1881 by 231 hospitals or dispensaries; the total number of persons treated during the year being 970,978, of whom 23,444 were in-door and 937,534 out-door patients. Six lunatic asylums contained a daily average of 893 inmates. The registered death-rate for the Province in 1881 was 20\u00b096 per thousand, or a total of 1,243,257 out of a total population of 65 millions where the registration system is compulsory. This average is almost certainly below the truth, owing to imperfections in the returns. The death-rate among the prison population was as high as 66 per thousand.\n\nConclusion.\u2014The cheapness of labour, as compared with European\ncountries, enables the Government to perform its functions at a small cost. It has brought courts very near to the door of the peasant, and has established a system of registration by which proprietary rights and transfers are cheaply recorded and ascertained. A great department of public works has spread a network of roads over the country, connected Bengal by railways with other parts of India, and is endeavouring to control the rivers and husband the water supply, on which the safety of a tropical people depends. An organized system of emigration watches over the movements of the landless classes, from the overcrowded or unfertile Districts of the west to the rich under-populated territories on the east, and to colonies beyond the seas. Charitable dispensaries, and a well-equipped medical department, struggle to combat the diseases and epidemics which from time immemorial have devastated the Delta, and to place the operations of European surgery within the reach of the poorest peasant.\n\n**Beni.**\u2014Town in Tiroh\u00e1 tahsil, Bhand\u00e1r\u00e1 District, Central Provinces; situated on the Wai\u1e45gang\u00e1 river, about 50 miles north-east of Bhand\u00e1r\u00e1 town. Population (1881) 2439, namely, Hindus, 1898; Kab\u00edrpanth\u00eds, 416; Muhammadans, 72; Jains, 2; aboriginal tribes, 51; number of houses, 247. Small trade in locally-manufactured cotton cloth. The dyers of the village are noted for the excellence of their colours, and for their tasteful patterns for carpets, etc. Village school.\n\n**Beniganj.**\u2014Town in Hardoi District, Oudh; 21 miles south-east of Hardoi Town, and 16 miles north of Sand\u00edla. A thriving Ah\u00edr village of 2483 inhabitants (1881), and 386 mud houses; police post; Government school; weekly market.\n\n**Beni Ras\u00falpur.**\u2014Village in Purniah District, Bengal; situated on the Kank\u00e1i river; distant from Kadb\u00e1 6 miles, and from Purniah town 26 miles. Lat. 25\u00b0 37\u2032 N., long. 87\u00b0 52\u2032 E. Beni Ras\u00falpur is the only village in the District with a considerable number of masonry buildings, and is the residence of the Muhammadan zamind\u00e1rs or landholders.\n\n**Benugarh.**\u2014Fort in the Krishnaganj Sub-division of Purniah District, Bengal. Only the foundations and portions of the walls remain, and the history of this and other ruins in the neighbourhood is involved in obscurity. The fort is one of five which, according to local legend, were built in a single night by five brothers, Br\u00e1hmans, who are said to have lived in the Vikram\u00e1ditya period, or about 57 B.C.\n\n**Berar.**\u2014See HYDERABAD ASSIGNED DISTRICTS.\n\n**Berd\u00ed.**\u2014Town in Saus\u00e1r tahsil, Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 District, Central Provinces.

Houses, 54,348; population (1881) 303,303, namely, males 146,853,\nand females 156,450. Area, 475 square miles, containing 5 towns and 527 villages. Land revenue demand (1881-82) \u00a355,770. The taluk contains 1 civil and 3 criminal courts, with 10 police stations; strength of regular police, 126. Chief town, Berhampur.\n\n**Berhampur** (*Berhampore, Brahmapur*).\u2014Town and military station in the Berhampur taluk, Ganjam District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 19\u00b0 18' 40\" N., long. 84\u00b0 47' 50\" E. Situated on the Grand Trunk Road, 525 miles north-east from Madras, 18 miles south-west of Ganjam and 13 miles from Chatrapur (Chetterpur), and connected by a good road with Gop\u00e1lpur, distant 9 miles, on the coast. Houses, 4973; population (1881) 23,599, namely, Hindus, 21,692; Muhammadans, 1,401; and Christians, 506. Of the adult males, 18 per cent. are traders and 12 per cent. weavers. Municipal income, \u00a32285 per annum; incidence per head (exclusive of military population), 1s. 3\u00bdd. The military force consists of one wing of a native regiment. Being the head-quarters of Ganjam District, Berhampur possesses all the public buildings and establishments of a station of first-class importance\u2014sessions court-house, magistrate's court, District jail and police-station, college, two churches, post and telegraph offices, etc. A considerable trade is carried on in sugar, and silk cloth is manufactured from Chinese and Bengal cocoons. The Madras Bank has opened a branch here. The town is built upon a rocky ledge, surrounded by an extensive cultivated plain sloping towards the sea-coast and bounded by hills on the west and north, from 5 to 6 miles distant. In 1880-81, the registered birth-rate was 21\u00b71 per 1000 of population, and the registered death-rate 20\u00b79; the sum allotted for sanitary purposes was \u00a3458. The town has always been unhealthy. The cantonment, as distinct from the old town, is known as Baupur.\n\n**Berhampur** (*Berhampore, Bahrampur*).\u2014Large municipal town and administrative head-quarters of Murshidabad District, Bengal, and till within the last few years a military cantonment; situated on the left bank of the Bh\u00e1girathi, 5 miles below the city of Murshidabad. The population, which in 1872 numbered 27,110, amounted in 1881 to 23,605, namely, 18,167 Hindus, 5,188 Muhammadans, and 250 Christians and 'others.' The decrease is owing to the abandonment of Berhampur as a military station. Area of town site, 6505 acres. Municipal income in 1880-81, \u00a31678; expenditure, \u00a31679. Berhampur was first selected as a site for military barracks in October 1757, shortly after the battle of Plassey; the factory house at K\u00e1simb\u00e1z\u00e1r having been destroyed by Sur\u00e1j-ud-daul\u00e1, and the fortifications dismantled in the previous year. A sanad (grant) was obtained from M\u00edr Jafar for 113 acres of ground; but the Court of Directors disallowed the project, and it was not until 1765 that the present barracks were commenced, the immediate object of their construction being to\nsecure Bengal against such another occurrence as the revolt of Mir K\u00e1sim in 1763. The barracks were completed in 1767, at a cost of \u00a3302,270. They still form the most prominent feature of the town, though of late years they have been rarely occupied by European troops, and have now (1881) been to a great extent appropriated to other uses. In 1786, they contained 2 regiments of Europeans, 7 or 8 of Sepoys, and 15 or 16 guns. By 1857, this garrison had dwindled down to 1 battalion of Native Infantry, 1 of irregular cavalry, and 2 guns. After the Mutiny, European troops were again stationed here, but they were finally withdrawn in 1870. The cantonment will always be remembered as the scene of the first overt act of mutiny in 1857. The Sepoys of the 19th Native Infantry, who had been intensely excited by the story of the 'greased' cartridges, rose, on the night of the 25th February, in open mutiny, but were prevented from doing any actual harm by the firm and at the same time conciliatory behaviour of their commanding officer, Colonel Mitchell. An account of this event will be found in Sir John Kaye's History of the Sepoy War (3rd edition, pp. 496-508), quoted in a condensed form in the Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. ix. pp. 77-80. The civil courts are about a mile from the barracks south-west; the treasury, magistrate's and collector's offices, jail, and lunatic asylum are within them. There are several churches in the town, and the cemetery contains some interesting memorial stones. A Government college, founded in 1853, was in 1880-81 attended by 33 students.\n\n**Beri** *(Behri, Bheri).*\u2014Petty State in Bundelkhand, Central Indian Agency, lying between 25\u00b0 53' and 25\u00b0 57' 45\" N. lat., and between 79\u00b0 54' 15\" and 80\u00b0 4' E. long.; area, about 30 square miles; population (1881) 4985, namely, Hindus, 4754, and Muhammadans, 231; revenue, \u00a32100. The chief is a Pu\u00e1r R\u00e1jput. He holds his territories by an ikr\u00e1rn\u00e1ma, or deed of fealty and obedience to the British Government, and a sanad from the Government confirming possession. He has also a sanad of adoption. He maintains a force of 25 cavalry and 125 infantry.

Police station, post-office, school, municipal hall.\n\n**Beria.**\u2014Ancient town in Nim\u00e1r District, Central Provinces, 28 miles north-east of Khandw\u00e1 town. Founded in the time of the Ghor\u00ed dynasty of M\u00e1lw\u00e1, between the 14th and 16th centuries. A large reservoir two miles south of the town, constructed by these kings, which had fallen into ruins, was repaired in 1846. It now irrigates about 200 acres of land, and provides the town with a pure water supply. The town contains a handsome Jain temple, and is the residence of a good many merchants of that faith.\n\n**Beridi.**\u2014Estate in Ganj\u00e1m District, Madras Presidency.

Area, 260 square miles; land revenue (1874-75), exclusive of water rate, \u00a39539, or 2s. 7d. per cultivated acre. Head-quarters at Bowring-pet. The river Pal\u00e1r runs through the t\u00e1luk, and forms here the large R\u00e1mas\u00e1gar tank. An auriferous tract lies on the west, and near the village of Markupam are gold mines; the southern borders of the t\u00e1luk abut upon the Eastern Gh\u00e1ts.\n\n**Betmangala.**\u2014Village in Kol\u00e1r District, Mysore State; on right bank of Pal\u00e1r river, 18 miles south-east of Kol\u00e1r by road. Lat. 13\u00b0 1' N., long. 78\u00b0 22' 30\" E.; population (1881) 1302. An ancient place, said to have been founded in the time of the Chola kings. It has now lost its prosperity, partly from the opening of the railway which diverted the former through passenger traffic, and partly from the transfer of the t\u00e1luk head-quarters in 1864 to Bowring-pet.\n\n**Bett\u00e1dpur.**\u2014Mountain in Mysore District, Mysore State; 4350 feet above sea level. Lat. 12\u00b0 28' 20\" N., long. 76\u00b0 8' 20\" E. It is conspicuous for its conical shape, and on its summit stands a celebrated temple of Mallikarjuna, which has been struck by lightning. At the foot lies the village of Bett\u00e1dpur, the principal seat of the Sanketi Br\u00e1hmans; population (1881) 2313. It is associated with the name of Chengal R\u00e1ya, a Jain prince of the 10th century, who is said to have been converted to the tenets of the Ling\u00e1yats. Until the time of Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n, it was the residence of an independent chieftain.\n\n**Betti\u00e1.**\u2014Sub-division of Champ\u00e1ran District, Bengal, lying between 26\u00b0 35' and 27\u00b0 30' N. lat., and between 83\u00b0 53' 30\" and 84\u00b0 51' E. long.; area, 2013 square miles; number of villages, 3172; number of occupied houses, 128,979; population (1881) 704,052, namely, 597,173 Hindus, 105,054 Muhammadans, and 1825 Christians; average density of population, 350 per square mile; villages per square mile, 1.58; houses per square mile, 66.6; persons per village, 221; persons per house, 5.4. The Sub-division was formed in 1852. It contains two magisterial and revenue courts, and comprises the 3 th\u00e1nd\u00e1s (police circles) of Bett\u00ed\u00e1, Lauriy\u00e1, and Bagah\u00e1; strength of regular police force, 119 men; village watchmen, 1307.\n\n**Betti\u00e1.**\u2014The largest town in Champ\u00e1ran District, Bengal; situated on the Harh\u00e1 river. Lat. 26\u00b0 48' 5\" N., long. 84\u00b0 32' 40\" E. Population (1881) 21,263, namely, 13,943 Hindus, 6014 Muhammadans, and 1306 Christians and 'others.' Area of town site, 5901 acres. A\nsecond-class municipality, consisting of 9 members. Municipal income in 1880-81, \u00a3693; expenditure, \u00a3780. Betti\u00e1 is the most important trade-centre in Champ\u00e1ran, and would be even more frequented if water communication could be kept open all the year by the Harh\u00e1 and Gandak rivers. The T\u00edrh\u00fat State Railway is now (1883) in course of construction from Muzaffarpur through Motih\u00e1ri to Betti\u00e1. The most noteworthy building is the palace of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Betti\u00e1, the wealthiest of the three great Champ\u00e1ran landlords, situated on the west side of the town. Close to it are the Roman Catholic church and mission-house. This mission was founded in 1746 by an Italian priest, who established himself at Betti\u00e1 on the invitation of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1. The converts, being principally descendants of Br\u00e1hmans, hold a fair social position, but some are extremely poor. About one-fourth are carpenters, one-tenth blacksmiths, one-tenth servants, and the remainder carters. The town lies very low, and the surrounding country becomes a swamp during the rains. A large fair in honour of R\u00e1ma is held in the town in October, which lasts for fifteen days, and is attended by from 25,000 to 30,000 persons. Cloth and brass and iron utensils are largely sold, as well as minor articles, such as toys, sweetmeats, etc. A large charitable dispensary is established here.\n\nBettur.\u2014Village in Davangere t\u00e1luk, Chitaldr\u00fag District, Mysore State. Lat. 14\u00b0 29' N., long. 76\u00b0 E.; population (1881) 919. Said to have been the capital of the V\u00e1dava kings of Dev\u00e1giri during the 13th century.\n\nBet\u00fal (Bitool).\u2014District in the Chhindw\u00e1ra Division of the Chief Commissionership of the Central Provinces, lying between 21\u00b0 21' and 22\u00b0 25' N. lat., and 77\u00b0 8' and 78\u00b0 20' E. long. Bounded on the north and west by Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d District, on the east by Chhindw\u00e1ra, while of its southern border the eastern half touches Amraoti District, and the western half marches with Ellichpur. Population (1881) 304,905; area, 3995 square miles. The administrative head-quarters are at Badn\u00far.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Although essentially a highland country, with a mean elevation of 2000 feet above the sea, this District divides itself naturally into several portions, distinguished by their appearance, their soil, and their geological formation. Bet\u00fal, the chief town, occupies the centre of the District. It lies in a level basin of rich land, composed of a deep alluvial deposit, entirely devoid of black soil. This tract is almost entirely under cultivation, being studded with numerous and thriving village communities. Through it flow the perennial streams of the Machn\u00e1 and S\u00e1mpn\u00e1, while on every side except the west steep ridges of igneous rocks shut it in. Westward, the T\u00e1pti winds through a deep valley clothed with dense jungle. Here, at intervals, rocks emerge from beneath the trap. Below this fertile plain, a rolling plateau of basaltic formation spreads over the southern part\nof the District, with the sacred town of Mult\u00e1i at its highest point, till it is lost in the wild and broken line of mountains which parts Bet\u00fal from the low country beyond. Fruitful valleys lie between the successive ridges of trap rock, and in a few places the shallow soil on the tops of the hills has been turned to account. But most of the land is barren; trees rarely occur; and the southern face of the District is bare and desolate. Above the town of Bet\u00fal extends a tract of poor land, thinly inhabited and meagrely cultivated, ending in the main chain of the S\u00e1tpura Hills, beyond which a considerable fall takes place in the general level of the country. To the north lies an irregular plain of sandstone formation, well wooded, and presenting in places the appearance of a vast park; but the soil is for the most part unfit for the plough, and barely rewards the labours of the few cultivators. On the extreme north, the District is bounded by a line of mountains rising sheer out of the great plain of the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda). The western portion of this region is a mass of hill and jungle, inhabited almost wholly by Gonds and Kurk\u00fas. It has but few hamlets, scattered over wide tracts of waste land, and seen from some neighbouring height, it appears a vast unbroken wilderness. Besides the T\u00e1pt\u00ed, the Wardh\u00e1 and the Bel rise in the high plateau of Mult\u00e1i, which thus sends its waters both to the western and eastern coasts. The Taw\u00e1 flows for a short distance only through the north-east corner of the District. The Machn\u00e1, the S\u00e1mpn\u00e1, and the Moran are the only other rivers of any size; but throughout Bet\u00fal, and especially among the trap rocks, a number of small streams retain water in places all the year round. Some use is made of them for irrigation. Cutcrops of coal occur at several places; but the seams are not of sufficient thickness to render it probable that they can be profitably mined. Forests cover a large extent of country. Two of the best timber-bearing tracts, with a total area of 287 square miles, have been reserved by the Government as 'first-class reserves.' They contain abundance of young teak, some magnificent s\u00e1j (Pentaptera glabra), kaw\u00e1 (Pentaptera arjuna), shisham (Dalbergia latifolia), s\u00e1lai (Boswellia thurifera), and other excellent timber. The second-class reserved State forests extend over 852 square miles. The Bet\u00fal forests yielded in 1880\u201381 a revenue to Government of \u00a34186, as against an expenditure of \u00a31398.\n\nHistory.\u2014In early times, Bet\u00fal formed the centre of the Gond kingdom of Kherl\u00e1; but the history of this dynasty is comprised in an occasional mention of Ferishta. From him we learn that in the 15th century a contest was carried on with varying success between the Gond princes of Kherl\u00e1 and the kings of M\u00e1lw\u00e1. Later, it is said, a Gaul\u00ed power supplanted the ancient Gond chiefs, but again yielded to an uprising of the aborigines. Be this as it may, about 1700, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bakht Buland, by race a Gond, but a convert to the religion of Isl\u00e1m,\nreigned at Deogarh over the whole of the N\u00e1gpur country below the gh\u00e1ts. He was succeeded by his son, who died in 1739, leaving two boys of tender years. Disputes as to the succession led to the interference of Raghuji Bhonsla, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 ruler of Berar, and ended in the virtual annexation of Bet\u00fal to the kingdom of the Bhonslas. In 1818, after the defeat and flight of Ap\u00e1 S\u00e1hib, this District formed part of the territory ceded to the British for payment of the military contingent; and by the treaty of 1826, Bet\u00fal was formally incorporated with the British possessions. Detachments of English troops were stationed at Mult\u00e1i, Bet\u00fal, and Sh\u00e1hpur in 1818, in order to cut off Ap\u00e1 S\u00e1hib\u2019s flight westward from Pachmarhi, but he evaded them and escaped. A military force was quartered at Bet\u00fal until June 1862.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1872 disclosed a population of 284,055 persons, living on an area of 4118 square miles. Subsequent transfers reduced the area of the District to 3965 square miles, with a population (in 1872) of 273,890. The Census of 1881 returned the population at 304,905, showing an increase of 31,105, or 11.32 per cent. in the nine years. This population was distributed throughout 1172 towns and villages; number of houses, 63,725, of which 58,603 were inhabited, and 5122 uninhabited; average density of population, 78.1 per square mile; number of houses, 15.01 per square mile; inmates per occupied house, 5.2. Divided according to sex, there were\u2014males, 154,426, and females, 150,479; proportion of males in total population, 50.65 per cent. According to religious classification, Hindus numbered 182,260; of Kab\u00edranth\u00eds, 132; Satn\u00e1m\u00eds, 2; Muhammadans, 5032; Christians, 34; Jains, 942; aboriginal tribes, 116,503. The most numerous of the aboriginal tribes are the Gonds, who numbered 87,645 in 1881, of whom 2873 were returned as Hindus, the remaining 84,772 still following their primitive faith. The second tribe of importance is that of the Kurk\u00fas (31,690 in 1881, including 983 Hindus). The remaining aboriginal population consists of Bhils, Bharias, etc. Among the Hindus, in 1881, the Br\u00e1hmans numbered 3012, the mass of the Hindu population consisting of R\u00e1jputs (5572), Kunbis or Kurm\u00eds (45,469), Bhuiyas (17,097), Dhers or Mhars (20,487), and Ahirs (15,078). The Gonds are found in all the jungle villages, where they live by labour in the field. They are sub-divided into about 20 tribes, and into at least 12 religious sects, distinguished by the number of gods each worships, seven being the favourite number. The lowest caste adores an indefinite but less important multitude, being obliged to content itself with the deities who chanced to be omitted when the legendary distribution of gods to each sect took place. The Kurk\u00fas have a faith different from that of the Gonds, and rather imitative of Hinduism. But, like the Gonds, they worship their ancestors, they \u2018wake\u2019 the dead, and celebrate births and\nmarriages with drinking bouts. Among these tribes a suitor will serve for his wife for a fixed period, after the manner of Jacob. Both Kurk\u00fas and Gonds live from hand to mouth, and often suffer great privations in seasons of scarcity. Classified according to occupation, the Census Report divided the male population into six main classes, as follow:\u2014(1) Professional class, including Government officers and the learned professions, 3212; (2) domestic servants, etc., 1129; (3) commercial class, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 1673; (4) agricultural and pastoral classes, including gardeners, 74,823; (5) manufacturing, artisan, and other industrial classes, 13,721; (6) indefinite and unproductive (comprising 7104 labourers, and 52,764 unspecified, including children), 59,868.\n\nDivision into Town and Country.\u2014Only five towns in the District have a population exceeding two thousand\u2014Betul, 4693; Multai, 3423; Badnur, 2881; Bhesdehi, 2653; and Atner, 2429. Townships of one to two thousand inhabitants, 24; from two hundred to a thousand, 505; villages of less than two hundred inhabitants, 638.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Of the total area of 3904 square miles, only 991 were cultivated in 1880; and of the portion lying waste, 278 miles were returned as grazing land, and 821 as available for tillage; 10,470 acres were returned in the same year as irrigated, entirely by private enterprise. The Government assessment is at the rate of 7d. per acre of the cultivated land, or 3\u00bdd. on the cultivable land. The chief crops consist of wheat and pulses. Wheat is sown in October. No manure is used, and the fields are very rarely irrigated. The grain ripens early in the spring. In the hills, the villagers formerly practised the d\u0101hya system of cultivation. After clearing a piece of ground on a slope or on the edge of a stream, they cover the surface with logs of wood, and these again with brushwood. Before the rains, but not until the hot weather has thoroughly dried it, they set the wood on fire; finally, after the first fall of rain, they scatter the seed among the ashes, or, where the ground is steep, throw it in a lump along the top of the plot to be washed to its place by the rains. This practice has recently been stopped, owing to the indiscriminate destruction of valuable forest timber it caused. The acreage under the different crops was thus returned in 1880\u201381:\u2014Wheat, 117,376 acres; rice, 17,850; other food-grains, 412,921; oil-seeds, 83,384; sugar-cane, 8319; cotton, 1606; other fibres, 3291; tobacco, 89; vegetables, 2193; other crops, 154. The average number of acres cultivated in 1881 by each head of the adult agricultural population (124,702, or 40\u00b790 per cent. of the District population), was 12 acres; the amount of Government land revenue, and local cesses, levied on the landholders, was \u00a320,316; and the amount of rental, including cesses, paid by the cultivators, was \u00a343,085, or an average of 11d. per cultivated acre. The average rent per acre of\nland suited for wheat in 1880\u201381 was 2s. 6d.; the average produce per acre, 495 lbs. The price averaged 6s. 4d. per cwt. Average wages per diem\u2014skilled labour, 1s; unskilled, 4\u00bdd.\n\nCommerce and Trade.\u2014The internal trade of Bet\u00fal has but scanty proportions. The single industry of importance is weaving. Of the artisans, the blacksmiths and workers in the precious metals form the most numerous class. Coal exists at various places on the Machn\u00e1 and Taw\u00e1 rivers; but, except at R\u00e1wandeo on the Taw\u00e1, no seam is known to occur exceeding 3 feet in thickness. At present such coal probably could not be worked at a profit. Bet\u00fal is better provided with means of communication than any of the S\u00e1tpura Hill Districts. Five main roads radiate from Badn\u00far, running respectively towards N\u00e1gpur, Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d, Mau, Ellichpur, and Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1. Of these the first and fourth are partially bridged, the second bridged the whole way. In 1881, the total length of made roads was returned at 233 miles, being 2nd class 95, and 3rd class 138. The District has no navigable river, and no railway passes within its limits.\n\nAdministration.\u2014By the treaty of 1826, Bet\u00fal District was formally incorporated with the British possessions. It is administered by a Deputy Commissioner, with assistants and tahsild\u00e1rs; it is divided for revenue purposes into 2 tahsils (Mult\u00e1i and Bet\u00fal), and for police purposes into the six circles of Mult\u00e1i, Bet\u00fal, Atner, Sh\u00e1hpur, S\u00e1ul\u00edgarh or Chichol\u00ed, and Amla, with 20 outposts. In 1881\u201382, the land revenue yielded \u00a319,016; excise, \u00a312,748; assessed taxes, \u00a3559; forests, \u00a34186; stamps, \u00a33023. Total revenue, \u00a339,532. Under the old Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Government each village had its p\u00e1tel or head-man, who, besides exercising a certain jurisdiction, collected the revenue from the tenants, and paid it into the Government treasuries, after deducting his authorized percentage. This office was generally hereditary; but the exactions of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Government in its wars at the beginning of this century drove out the p\u00e1tels, and brought in a swarm of speculators, who farmed the villages for short periods at rack-rents. The villages continually changed hands; several often fell under the control of the same man, and the old p\u00e1tel gave way to the modern m\u00e1lguz\u00e1r. In 1837, however, a light Settlement for 20 years enabled those who then possessed estates to hold on and prosper; and it is on these men or their descendants that the Settlement lately completed has finally conferred proprietary right, subject only to the payment of the Government revenue and to the recognition of such tenant rights as have been recorded. Total cost in 1881\u201382 of District officials and police of all kinds, \u00a312,228; number of civil and revenue judges within the District, 6; magistrates, 6; maximum distance of any village from the nearest court, 52\u2014average distance, 22 miles; number of police, 346, costing \u00a34204, being 1 policeman to\nevery 11.3 square miles and to every 881 inhabitants. The daily average number of convicts in jail in 1881 was 45, of whom 3 were females. The cost of maintaining and guarding the prisoners in that year was \u00a3374. The number of Government or aided schools in the District under Government inspection was 26, attended by 1693 pupils. Of the three municipalities in 1881-82, Bet\u00fal, with a population of 4693, returned an income of \u00a3104, of which \u00a3102 was derived from taxation; Mult\u00e1i, with a population of 3423, returned an income of \u00a380, of which \u00a378 was derived from taxation; and Badnur, with a population of 4280, returned an income of \u00a3105, of which \u00a3102 was derived from taxation. There is no octroi, the only municipal taxes being those levied on houses and lands. Average rate of municipal taxation per head of the population\u2014Bet\u00fal, 5\u00bdd.; Mult\u00e1i, 5\u00bdd.; Badnur, 5\u00bdd.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014During the greater part of the year, Europeans find the climate of Bet\u00fal agreeable and not unhealthy. The elevation of the country, and the neighbourhood of extensive forests, temper the great heat of the sun; and even in the hot season the nights are cool and pleasant. Between January and May, showers are not infrequent. Little or no hot wind is felt before the end of April, and even then it ceases after sunset. During the rains, the climate is sometimes cold and raw, thick cloud and mist enveloping the sky for many days together. The plateau on the Hill of Kh\u00e1ml\u00e1, in the south-west corner of the District, would afford an agreeable retreat to Europeans during the unhealthy season; but hitherto the scarcity of water has proved an insurmountable obstacle. In 1876, the rainfall at the civil station was 60 inches, but 43 inches may be regarded as the usual fall. Average temperature in the shade at the civil station in 1881\u2014May, highest reading, 107\u00b0 F., lowest reading, 68\u00b0; July, highest reading, 88\u00b0, lowest, 69\u00b0; December, highest reading, 81\u00b0, lowest, 41\u00b0. By far the most fatal complaint is fever, to which cause are generally due about 80 per cent. of the deaths throughout the District. Dysentery, also, and other bowel complaints, constantly prove fatal. No fewer than 1346 deaths from cholera were registered in 1876, but only 2 in 1881.\n\n[For further information regarding Bet\u00fal, see the Settlement Report of the District, by W. Ramsay, Esq., Bombay, C.S. (1866). Also the Gazetteer of the Central Provinces, by Charles Grant, Esq., C.S., C.S.I. (second edition, N\u00e1gpur, 1870); the Census Report of the Central Provinces for 1881; and the Administration Reports for those Provinces from 1880 to 1883.]\n\nBet\u00fal.\u2014Revenue sub-division or tahsil in Bet\u00fal District, Central Provinces; lying between 21\u00b0 21' and 22\u00b0 21' N. lat., and between 77\u00b0 13' 15\" and 78\u00b0 15' 45\" E. long. Area, 2944 square miles. Population (1881) 211,737, namely, 107,403 males, and 104,334 females, dwelling\nin 862 villages and 40,699 houses; average density of population, 71.22 per square mile; area under cultivation, 985 square miles; amount of Government land revenue, with local rates and cesses, \u00a312,949; rental, including cesses paid by cultivators, \u00a329,689, or 11\u00bdd. per acre of cultivated area.\n\n**Bet\u00fal.**\u2014Town in Bet\u00fal District, Central Provinces, and the civil head-quarters before their removal to Badnur, five miles distant. Lat. 21\u00b0 51' 16\" N., long. 77\u00b0 58' 7\" E. Population (1881) 4693, namely, Hindus, 4332; Muhammadans, 210; Jains, 68; and aboriginal tribes, 83, chiefly belonging to the Kurmi and Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Br\u00e1hman castes; mostly agriculturists. Bet\u00fal has one school, a police outpost, an old fort, and an English cemetery. Brisk trade in pottery. Bet\u00fal was the civil station of the District, before its removal to Badnur.\n\n**Bet\u00falpiudangad\u00ed** (*Vettattap\u00fadiyangad\u00ed*).\u2014Town in Malab\u00e1r District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 10\u00b0 53' N., long. 75\u00b0 58' 15\" E. Situated two miles east of the Tir\u00far railway station. Contains sub-magistrates' and judges' courts, built with the materials of the palace of the Bet\u00faln\u00e1d (Vettattan\u00e1d) R\u00e1j\u00e1s, destroyed by Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n in 1784.\n\n**Betw\u00e1.**\u2014River in Bundelkhand, Central India Agency. Between lat. 22\u00b0 55' and 25\u00b0 55' 45\" N.; long. 77\u00b0 39' 30\" and 80\u00b0 15' 30\" E. Rises in Bhop\u00e1l State, 1\u00bd mile south of the large tank at Bhop\u00e1l; flows south-east for 20 miles to Satapur, there takes a north-east course for 35 miles, crossing into Gwalior State, through which it proceeds in the same direction for 115 miles; thence enters L\u00e1litpur District, forming the boundary between British territory and Gwalior; passes into Jh\u00e1nsi, and through Ham\u00edrpur District, and finally falls into the Jumna about 3 miles below the town of Ham\u00edrpur. Total length, 360 miles. Chief tributaries, the Jamni, Dhas\u00e1n, Kol\u00e1hu, P\u00e1wan, and Barman. In the earlier part of its course it drains the Vindhyan Hills over a bed of sandstone; below Jh\u00e1nsi, it flows upon a channel of granite; and 16 miles lower down arrives at the alluvial basin of the Jumna valley, through which it passes till it reaches the point of junction near Ham\u00edrpur. Above Jh\u00e1nsi, the river presents a wild and picturesque appearance; and veins of quartz lying across its bed form barriers over which break several beautiful cascades. It is nowhere navigable, and of little use for irrigation; rises and falls rapidly; dry during hot weather in upper portion of its channel. Ordinary flood discharge, 200,000 cubic feet per second; in high floods, 500,000 cubic feet per second. The Betw\u00e1 is crossed in various parts of its course by the high roads from Nimach (Neemuch), Cawnpur, and G\u00fana (Goona) to S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor), from Jh\u00e1nsi to N\u00e1ndg\u00e1on, and from Banda to K\u00e1lpi. Crossings dangerous, and often impracticable. A canal for irrigating Jh\u00e1nsi District is now (1883) under construction, and a weir is being thrown across the Betw\u00e1, about 15 miles from Jh\u00e1nsi town.\nBeypur (Bepore, Vaypura, Vada Perapanad; named by Tipu, 'Sultanpatnam').\u2014Small town and port on the coast of Malabar District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 11\u00b0 10' N., long. 75\u00b0 50' 30\" E.; houses, 926; population (1881) 6739, namely, 5461 Hindus, 1264 Muhammadans, and 14 Christians. Situated near the mouth of the Beypur river, 6 miles south of Calicut. Although many attempts have been made to utilize the natural advantages of its maritime position, it was not until 1858, when Beypur was made a terminus of the Madras Railway, that the place became important. The Portuguese established a factory (Kalyan) here, but it failed. Tipu (see Ferokh) selected it as the site of the capital of Malabar, but hardly a vestige of its shortlived importance has survived. In 1797 sawmills, in 1805 a canvas factory, in 1848 ironworks, and still later, shipbuilding works were started at Beypur; but all from one cause or another have failed. In 1858, however, the railway gave the place its present importance. Being now a regular port for steamers, it possesses a custom-house. All the coffee of the Ochterlony valley, with much from the South-East Wainad, comes to Beypur for export. Rice forms the staple of the import trade. The bar admits craft of 300 tons to the river, and at low spring tides gives soundings of 12 to 14 feet. Iron ore and a sort of lignite both exist in the immediate vicinity of the town, and wood in great abundance. The teak grown on the Ghats to the east is floated down to Beypur for exportation. A few miles from the town lies the site of Ferokh, and 5 miles east is Chataparamba ('Field of Death'), remarkable for its ancient stone circles and monuments (see Trans. Lin. Soc., Bombay, vol. iii. p. 324), resembling the cromlechs of Salem and Coimbatore, and called by the natives kuda-kallu or 'umbrella stones.' Bepore, being neither a civil nor military station, has no administrative offices. Imports (1880-81), \u00a329,049, exports, \u00a3388,903. For details of trade returns, see Calicut.\n\nBeypur (Bepore, Pauna-puya, 'Gold River').\u2014River in Malabar District, Madras Presidency. Rises in the hills south of the Neddi-vattam Pass. After draining the Ochterlony valley, it descends by a series of cataracts over the Ghats north of the Karkur Pass. The scenery in this part of its course, owing to the precipitous and densely wooded banks, the boulder-strewn channel, and numerous waterfalls, is picturesque and wild. After reaching the low country the river receives many affluents; the chief being the Karim-puya\u2014where a massive timber bridge spans the joint stream. Then flowing gently past Arikod, it joins the Kodiatur. It debouches into the sea at Beypur, being joined near its mouth by the Kadalvandi, with which it forms the island of Chaliyam, containing the terminus of the Madras Railway, south-west line. The Beypur river is navigable for large boats all the year round as high as Arikod, and during the rains much farther.\nThe bar at its mouth has always at least 12 feet of water over it, and at high tides from 16 to 18 feet.\n\n**Beyt.**\u2014Island in the Gulf of Kachchh (Cutch), Bombay Presidency, lying between $22^\\circ 25'$ and $22^\\circ 29'$ N. lat., and between $69^\\circ 8'$ and $69^\\circ 12'$ E. long. It is a narrow and crooked strip of land, so that although it measures in a direct line from north-east to south-west 5 miles, its actual length is half as much again. The south-western half consists of a rocky table-land, about 50 or 60 feet high. The east end, 3 miles to the west of Paga sand, is called Hanum\u00e1n Point, after a temple of that name, situated about half a mile within the point. Fort flagstaff, lat. $22^\\circ 27' 30''$ N., long. $69^\\circ 5'$ E. Temples in honour of Krishna abound. The population consists principally of Br\u00e1hmans, supported by the offerings of pilgrims, with whom Beyt is a favourite place of resort. When the island was taken from the W\u00e1ghirs by a British force in 1859, its fort and principal temples were blown up.\n\n**Bezw\u00e1da (Bejav\u00e1da).**\u2014T\u00e1luk in Kistna District, Madras Presidency. Area, 534 square miles, containing 4 towns and 107 villages. Houses, 14,393. Land revenue, \u00a315,709. Population (1881) 82,895, namely, 41,778 males and 41,117 females. The t\u00e1luk contains 1 civil and 3 criminal courts, with 7 police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s); strength of regular police, 60 men. Chief town, Bezw\u00e1da.\n\n**Bezw\u00e1da (Bejav\u00e1da).**\u2014Town in the Bezw\u00e1da t\u00e1luk, Kistna District, Madras Presidency. Lat. $16^\\circ 30' 50''$ N., long. $80^\\circ 39'$ E.; population (1881) 9336; houses, 1202. Hindus number 7605; Muhammadans, 1584; Christians, 145; and \u2018others,\u2019 2. Situated on the Kistna river (here crossed by the most frequented ferry of the District), at the junction of the high roads from Madras to Calcutta, and from Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d to the coast, 20 miles north-east from Gant\u00far (Guntoor). Being also the entrep\u00f4t for most of the canal traffic of the Kistna delta, and connected by good water-ways with Madras, Ellore, Mas\u00falipatam, Cocon\u00e1da, and R\u00e1j\u00e1hm\u00e1ndr\u00ed, the town possesses a considerable internal trade. A fort erected here by the East India Company in 1760, was dismantled in 1820. Bezw\u00e1da possesses much interest for the archaeologist, being by some identified with the Dhan\u00e1kaketa of Hwen Thsang, and containing rock-cut temples of the Buddhist period, as well as very ancient Hindu pagodas. The hill to the west is (like several others) pointed out as the site of the legendary fight between Arj\u00fan and Indra. During the excavations for the canals and the anicut (which here crosses the Kistna), many valuable antiquarian discoveries were made. Bezw\u00e1da is the head-quarters of the Head Assistant Collector of the Kistna District of the tahs\u00edld\u00e1r of the t\u00e1luk, and of the superintending, District, and assistant engineers of the Public Works Department. It has a post-office, telegraph office, munsif\u2019s court, dispensary, circuit bungalow, jail, and library.\nBh\u00e1bhar.\u2014State and town, P\u00e1lanpur Agency, Bombay Presidency. \u2014See BABHAR.\n\nBhabu\u00e1.\u2014Sub-division of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bengal, lying between 24\u00b0 40' 15\" and 25\u00b0 24' 30\" N. lat., and between 83\u00b0 21' 30\" and 83\u00b0 56' E. long.; area, 1301 square miles; number of villages, 1388; number of occupied houses, 49,316; population (1881) 322,236, namely, 296,385 Hindus and 25,851 Muhammadans; average density of population, 248 per square mile; villages per square mile, 1.07; houses per square mile, 44; persons per village, 246; persons per house, 6.5.

For the most part it runs between steep banks and amid dense forests, and its waters are little used for irrigation. There are 18 dams, from which 325 acres are supplied with water; at Benkipur it is crossed by a bridge. According to the Pur\u00e1nic legend, given under Tungabhadra, the Bhadr\u00e1 was formed by the right tusk of the boar avat\u00e1r of Vishnu.\n\nBhadr\u00e1.\u2014Zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1ri or chiefship in the Burh\u00e1 tahsil, B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t District, Central Provinces.

Celebrated for the temple of R\u00e1machandra, who is said to have crossed the river at this spot, on his famous expedition to the island of Ceylon, and also for the annual fair held here in his honour. This temple was built four centuries ago by Rishi Prat\u00edshtha, but additions have been made from time to time. It consists of a main building with a fine dome, flanked by 24 smaller temples on both sides. It is surrounded by a high wall, and may be ascended by steps from near the bank of the God\u00e1var\u00ed. The sacred jewels are said to be of great value.

Most of the architectural remains have been removed for building-stone; but the place is still interesting for its Jain temple, for the pillars and part of the dome of a Sivaite shrine with an interesting w\u00e1v or well, and two mosques, one of the latter almost buried by drifting sand from the shore. A very ancient seat of Buddhist worship; but the earliest ruins now existing belong to temples erected subsequent to 1125 A.D., when one Jagadeva S\u00e1h, a merchant who had made a fortune as a grain dealer in a time of famine, received a grant of Bhadreswar, and in repairing the temple 'removed all traces of antiquity.' The temple was a celebrated place of pilgrimage in the 12th and 13th centuries. At the close of the 17th century, the temple was plundered by the Muhammadans, and many of the images of the Jain Tirthankars were broken. Since then it has been neglected, and having fallen into ruins, the temple stones, and those of the old city fort, were used for the building of the seaport town of Munra or Mundra.

It is bounded on the north by the Independent State of Nep\u00e1l; on the east, north of the Ganges, by the District of Purniah; on the south and on the east, south of the Ganges, by the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s; and on the west by the Districts of Darbhanga and Monghyr. The administrative headquarters are at BHAGALPUR, on the right or south bank of the Ganges.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District is divided into two nearly equal portions by the Ganges. The northern division forms a continuation of the great alluvial plain of T\u00edrh\u00fat, being intersected by many rivers, which are connected with each other by innumerable dh\u00fars or water-courses; the southern and eastern portions of this tract are liable to inundation by the flooding of these rivers, and by the overflow of the Ganges on its northern bank. The north-eastern portion of the District, formerly one of the most fertile regions in the sub-Tar\u00e1i rice tract, has been completely devastated by changes in the course of the river K\u00fas\u00ed; the country has been laid under a deep layer of sand, and the once fertile soil is covered with high grass jungle, which gives shelter to tigers, buffaloes, and rhinoceroses. On the south of the Ganges, for some distance, the country is low, bare, and, except in the cold weather, almost entirely uncultivated. Farther south, the land rises a few feet; the soil is rich, and covered with rice and other crops; mango and palm groves abound, and numerous villages dot the plain. About twenty miles south of Bh\u00e1galpur town, the country begins to wear a different aspect, the land rises by an easy ascent, and the hilly country commences. The soil being less deep than to the northward, and lying upon rocks of primitive formation, the water is nearer the surface, and the trees attain an enormous growth, far beyond what is found on the deep alluvial plains of the Ganges. The mah\u00fa tree (Bassia latifolia), now becomes common, palms almost cease to be seen, the mangoes are no longer found in planted groves, but are scattered about in small groups; the cotton tree attains a great size, and\npatches of dh\u00e1k jungle appear. The fields of wheat and gram, instead of being neat and regular plots, form shapeless and irregular large spaces of ground; and the villages become scattered. This part of the country has been but recently reclaimed from jungle.\n\nThe river system of the District consists of a reach of the Ganges about 60 miles in length, with numerous Himalayan affluents on its north bank; and on the south a few hill streams, which during the greater part of the year are sandy water-courses, but in the rains become rivers of considerable size, although unnavigable from their rapidity, and the uncertainty of the duration of their floods. The northern rivers have mostly a direction from north to south, with a slight inclination eastwards. The larger of these rise amongst the Nep\u00e1l outliers of the Himalayas, and fall, after a more or less tortuous course, into the Gh\u00fagr\u00ed, which itself joins the K\u00fas\u00ed in the extreme east of Bh\u00e1galpur, about six miles above the confluence of that river with the Ganges, opposite Colgong. The most important of these secondary, northern rivers, are the Tilj\u00fag\u00e1, Bat\u00ed, Dimr\u00e1, Talab\u00e1, Parw\u00e1n, K\u00fas\u00ed, Dhus\u00e1n, Chalaun\u00ed, Loran, Katn\u00e1, Daus, and Gh\u00fagr\u00ed. South of the Ganges, the only stream worthy of separate notice is the Ch\u00e1ndan, the floods from which, although partially restrained by embankments, sometimes inundate the country for miles around, and cause great injury to the crops. The larger rivers are navigable throughout the year by boats of the heaviest burden, and the minor streams by smaller craft during the rainy season. Very marked changes have taken place in the courses of the two most important of the rivers\u2014the Ganges and the K\u00fas\u00ed. The stream of the Ganges in 1864 ran directly below the town of Bh\u00e1galpur, and steamers anchored close under the houses of the residents; a few years earlier the river flowed equally near the northern bank, formed by pargan\u00e1 Chh\u00e1i: its present course is between these limits. The channel of the K\u00fas\u00ed seems to have been advancing steadily westward for many centuries; the large trading village of N\u00e1thpur, which in 1850 lay some miles to the west of the river, has not only been swept away, but its site has been left many miles to the eastward.\n\nThere is no sheet of water in Bh\u00e1galpur of sufficient size or depth to be called a lake. Shallow marshes, however, are numerous. Considerable tracts of land on the south of the Ganges are inundated every year, which as they dry up are cultivated in the cold weather with abundant crops of wheat and Indian corn. The forests comprise two small areas of about 40 and 30 square miles respectively in the southern hilly country. In the north of the District there are in parts much low scrub jungle, interspersed with large trees. The tasar silk-worm is reared by the castes along the hill frontier, and forms an important forest industry. The principal mineral product is galena, found in\nplaces in large quantities, and much of which is argentiferous. Sulphuret of antimony is also found. Copper exists in the southern hills in various forms. Iron ore is also largely distributed, but is not much worked, owing to the difficulties in the way of procuring sufficient fuel, and a good flux.\n\n**History.**\u2014When the East India Company assumed the *div\u00e1n\u00ed* of Bengal (1765), Bh\u00e1galpur District formed the eastern part of the Muhammadan sark\u00e1r of Monghyr, and lay, with the exception of a single *pargan\u00e1* (Chh\u00e1i), to the south of the Ganges. At that time, the country to the south and west was in such an unsettled state, owing to the inroads of the hill tribes, that the exact boundaries of Bh\u00e1galpur in those directions cannot now be determined; and it was not until 1774 that an officer was specially deputed to ascertain the limits of the District. Down to 1769, the revenue and criminal jurisdiction continued in native hands. At the end of that year, an English Supervisor was appointed, who lived at R\u00e1jmah\u00e1l, and whose duties were \u2018to obtain a summary history of the provinces, the state, produce, and capacity of the lands, the amount of the revenues, the cesses or arbitrary taxes, and of all demands whatsoever which are made on the cultivators, the manner of collecting them, and the gradual rise of every new import, the regulations of commerce and the administration of justice.\u2019 He did not, however, actually supervise the collections. In 1772, when the Company determined to take the management of the revenue into its own hands, it was found that, during the previous seven years, more than \u00a350,000 of the land revenue had been embezzled annually. Measures were at once taken to place the collections on a satisfactory footing; the *zam\u00edn\u00e1drs* were ordered to live on their estates and attend to the collection of their rents, and were imprisoned if they fell into arrears. The next point to which the attention of the Collector was turned was the administration of criminal justice. The southern portion of the District, as has been stated, was subject to constant inroads from hill tribes. The ravages of these marauders became more and more serious. In December 1777 and January 1778, forty-four villages were plundered and burnt, and in May of the latter year the hillmen had become so daring that some of the Collector\u2019s tents were carried off within a few miles of the civil station of Bh\u00e1galpur. Large gangs of plunderers traversed the District, and life was as insecure as property. It had become a matter of supreme importance to pacify these hill tribes. Mr. Cleveland, who was then Collector of the District, set himself earnestly to the task, and, in conjunction with Captain James Browne, of R\u00e1jmah\u00e1l, originated and carried out a scheme which resulted in the arrangement of 1780 and the pensioning of the hill chiefs. The history of these proceedings will be found in the article on the Santal Parganas. From this date, the District\nentered upon a new phase of its history. The ravages of the hillmen did not at once cease; but the prompt measures with which each renewed attempt at disturbance was met eventually succeeded in producing the desired impression, and before the end of last century the country was finally freed from the inroads of the marauders. The prosperity of the District has gradually increased during the present century. Cultivation has spread; trade is flourishing; education is being rapidly extended; the people are prosperous; and property and person are safe.\n\nThere have been many changes of jurisdiction in the District, and it has little by little lost the character of a South Gangetic tract, which it possessed when it came into our hands; in 1864, 700 square miles of country on the north of the river were added to it. A further transfer was made in 1874, when Kharakpur pargan\u00e1 was separated from Bh\u00e1g-alpur and attached to Monghyr District. The various jurisdictions are now all conterminous.\n\n**Population.**\u2014The population of Bh\u00e1g-alpur was returned by the Census of 1872 (allowing for transfers since that date) at 1,824,738. The Census of 1881 disclosed a population of 1,966,158, being an increase of 141,420, or 7.75 per cent. in the nine years. Area of District, 4268 square miles; number of towns and villages, 6177; number of houses, 331,787, of which 321,469 were occupied, and 10,318 unoccupied; average density of population, 460.67 per square mile; towns or villages per square mile, 1.45; houses per square mile, 77.74; inhabitants per occupied house, 6.12. Divided according to sex, males number 979,119, and females 987,039; proportion of males to total population, 49.8 per cent. Classified according to religion, Hindus number 1,764,304, or 89.74 per cent.; Muhammadans, 185,533, or 9.44 per cent.; Christians, 578; Jews, 11; and \u2018others\u2019 (hill tribes professing aboriginal beliefs), 15,732, or .80 per cent. This does not, however, include all the aboriginal population, many of whom now profess some form of Hinduism, and are ranked as low-caste Hindus. The Census Report returns the aboriginal tribes professing Hinduism at 31,534; the principal being Bhuiy\u00e1s, 17,904; and Bhumijs, 8977. The aboriginal tribes still outside Hindu influences, are the Sant\u00e1ls, 13,384; and Kols, 2322. The high-caste Hindus include\u2014Br\u00e1hmans, 71,420; R\u00e1jputs, 60,491; B\u00e1bhans, an inferior caste of Br\u00e1hmans, 42,351; K\u00e1yasths, 21,810; and Baniy\u00e1s, 35,173. The lower castes of Hindus include\u2014Gw\u00e1l\u00e1, 343,830, the most numerous caste in the District; Dh\u00e1nuk, 101,665; Koeri, 82,302; K\u00farm\u00ed, 38,363; Madak, 22,312; Kandu, 34,724; Kumh\u00e1r, 36,319; Tatw\u00e1, 42,609; T\u00e1nti, 22,066; N\u00e1pit, 33,927; Kah\u00e1r, 28,902; Dhob\u00ed, 23,144; Tel\u00ed, 66,946; Kalw\u00e1r, 26,303; Keut, 35,516; Cham\u00e1r, 76,407; Dos\u00e1dh, 70,863; Dom, 17,124; Gh\u00e1tw\u00e1l, 11,989; Loh\u00e1r, 15,284; Mallah, 18,915;\nMusah\u00e1r, 79,584; Son\u00e1r, 16,914; Sunr\u00ed, 12,107, etc. The Muham-\nmadans are classified according to sect into\u2014Sunn\u00eds, 1,41,151; Shi\u00e1s,\n3318; and unspecified, 41,064. Of the 578 Christians, 323 are natives,\n154 Europeans, 46 Eurasi\u00e1ns, and 55 unspecified.\n\nDivision of the People into Town and Country; Occupations, etc.\u2014The\npopulation of the District is entirely rural, and there are only two\nmunicipal towns containing more than five thousand inhabitants \u2014\nnamely, Bh\u00e1g\u00e1lpur (population, 68,238) and Colgong (population,\n5672). Sonbarsa, which, however, is not a municipality, has a popu-\nlation of 5237. The villages and towns are classified as follows:\u2014\n3210 contain less than two hundred inhabitants; 1868, from two\nto five hundred; 797, from five hundred to a thousand; 258, from one\nto two thousand; 35, from two to three thousand; 6, from three to\nfive thousand; 2, from five thousand to ten thousand; and 1, upwards\nof fifty thousand inhabitants. The male population is classified\naccording to occupation into the following six main divisions\u2014(1)\nProfessional class, including Government officials and the learned\nprofessions, 6319; (2) domestic servants, etc., 42,602; (3) commer-\ncial class, including merchants, general dealers, carriers, etc., 35,404;\n(4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 362,360;\n(5) manufacturing, artisan, and other industrial classes, 51,829;\n(6) indefinite and non-productive (comprising 123,453 general\nlabourers, and 357,152 unspecified, including children), 480,605.\nThe inhabitants of the District, as a whole, are fairly happy and\ncontented, and the smaller cultivators are said to be better off than\ntheir brethren of the lower delta. A peasant, with a small holding of\n5 acres of land, although he would not be so well off as an ordinary\nretail shopkeeper, would be able to live quite as well as a man with a\nmonthly income of Rs. 8 or 16s. The cultivators of Bh\u00e1g\u00e1lpur generally\nare much less in debt to the mah\u00e1jans or grain merchants than is the\nsame class in Bengal. In the south of the District there is very little\ndebt.\n\nDemon-worship.\u2014A peculiar feature of the District is the pre-\nvalence of demon-worship, especially of a Br\u00e1hman-demon, Dube\nBhairan by name. In Bh\u00e1g\u00e1lpur District every village has its own\ndemon, who is propitiated by offerings made at the foot of a tree\nwhere he is supposed to reside. A belief in demons or ghosts is\nalmost as prevalent in Bengal proper as in Bh\u00e1g\u00e1lpur; but in Bengal if\nthe demons cause annoyance, the gods are invoked or exorcisms are\npractised to expel them; while in Bh\u00e1g\u00e1lpur they are propitiated by\npresents, and their blessings asked in cases of difficulty or danger.\nDemon-worship is not prevalent throughout Behar; and the few\nDistricts in which it exists are those bordering on tracts inhabited by\naboriginal tribes, such as Kols and Sant\u00e1ls.\nAntiquities.\u2014Near the town of Bh\u00e1galpur are two interesting Muhammadan shrines, and in the western suburb the Jain sect of Osw\u00e1ls have two curious places of worship. The only other objects of special interest in Bh\u00e1galpur are the Karn\u00e1garh Hill or Plateau, which formerly contained the lines of the Hill Rangers (embodied by Mr. Cleveland, the Collector, about 1780), but now occupied by a Native regiment; and the monument erected to that gentleman by the Directors of the E. I. Company. Colgong (Kahalg\u00e1on) was, until quite recently, a place of commercial importance, being on the main stream of the Ganges; but the river has since receded, and a large number of traders have left the place in consequence. Mahm\u00fad Sh\u00e1h, the last independent king of Bengal, died here. Um\u00e1rpur, Khandaul\u00ed, Balu\u00e1, and Sult\u00e1nganj are considerable trading villages; the last mentioned is situated on the bank of the Ganges, and is conspicuous for two large rocks of granite, on the top of one of which is a Muhammadan mosque, while the other is crowned by a Hindu temple, dedicated to Siva. The little village of Singheswar-th\u00e1n is the scene of a frequented elephant fair. But the most interesting place in the District is Mandargiri, the sacred hill, which is fabled to cover the body of the giant who attempted to destroy Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva. Vishnu struck off the monster\u2019s head, and in order to prevent the headless trunk from rising and shaking off the weight which covers it, the god keeps his foot ever on the hill, which is, in consequence, a spot of the greatest sanctity in Hindu mythology. It is a huge mass of granite, 700 feet high, and bare, save near the summit and on one side, where it is overgrown with low jungie. Coiling round the hill, the figure of a great serpent has been cut in relief; one of the legends connected with Mandar being that it was the hill used by the gods and Asurs to churn the ocean. Besides being a favourite place of pilgrimage, Mandar Hill possesses great interest for the antiquary, and abounds with remarkable ruins, and natural and artificial curiosities. A detailed account of these will be found in the Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. xiv. pp. 95\u2013102. Ruins of old forts, and of temples dating back to Buddhist times, are found in various parts of the District.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The principal crop in the District is rice, but this staple does not bear the same relative importance in Bh\u00e1galpur as in most other Districts of Bengal. The rice produced is for the most part exported. The bhad\u00e1i or early crop is sown in May and reaped in August; the agh\u00e1n\u00ed rice is also sown in May, but reaped in December and January. Among the other crops grown in the District are wheat, Indian corn, several kinds of millet, peas, oil-seeds, and indigo. Indian corn forms the staple food of the poor of Bh\u00e1galpur; it is sown in April or May, and ripens in August. When grown on\nhigh land this crop requires irrigation. The out-turn varies from 11 to 18 cwts. per acre. Indigo, which covers about 10,000 acres in the District, is sown in October and cut in the beginning of the rainy season. The area under *aghani* rice in Bh\u00e1galpur is estimated at 1,137,100 acres, and that under *bhadai* crops, including Indian corn, at 552,260 acres. Wages have increased considerably since the opening of the E. I. Railway. Coolies now get 2\u00bdd. (women, 1\u00bdd.) a day; formerly their pay was 1\u00bcd. to 1\u00bdd. Smiths and carpenters, who formerly got 2\u00bcd. to 2\u00bdd., now receive 3\u00bed.; bricklayers get 6d. a day, or double their former wages. Agricultural day-labourers are paid in kind, generally receiving only a day's food in return for the day's work.\n\nThe price of the best cleaned rice varies from about 4s. 8d. to 7s. 6d. a cwt.; common rice from 2s. 9d. to 4s. 8d.; wheat from 4s. 5d. to 5s. 10d.; and Indian corn from 2s. 2d. to 3s. 6d. per cwt. The greater portion of Bh\u00e1galpur consists of permanently settled estates, and there are few intermediate permanent rights between the *zamindar* and the cultivator. *Zamindaris* are generally let on short leases to farmers, who try to make as much as they can during their term, and never attempt to improve the condition of the tenantry or the land. The peasantry are said to be not much in debt to the *mah\u00e1jans* or village money-lenders. The District contained in 1875, 4364 revenue-paying tenures held direct under Government; 3004 intermediate tenures; 7876 *l\u00e1khir\u00e1j* (revenue-free) and 1618 service tenures. Among the last are more than 200 held by *gh\u00e1tw\u00e1lis*; the nature of these *gh\u00e1tw\u00e1l\u00ed* holdings is explained in the article on Bankura District. Rents vary greatly according to the nature of the soil and the position of the land. In the north, the rates are generally low, except in *pargan\u00e1* N\u00e1ridigar, which is exceedingly fertile. The lowest rates of all are to be found in the neighbourhood of the river K\u00fasi, which is always changing its course.\n\n**Natural Calamities.**\u2014Bh\u00e1galpur has suffered from time to time from scarcity, and there are records of famines in 1770, 1775, 1779, and 1783. Between 1783 and 1865\u201366, the year of the great Orissa famine, the District seems to have been free from this scourge. In the famine of 1866, Bh\u00e1galpur suffered considerably, and the price of rice rose to 12s. 9\u00bdd. per cwt. The highest average daily number of persons relieved gratuitously was 1108, and the largest average number employed on relief work during any month was about 700. There was a good deal of sickness, but no epidemic prevailed. In 1874, when the District was again threatened with famine, measures were taken on an extensive scale to avert such a calamity. The expenditure incurred in dealing with the scarcity was over \u00a391,000, exclusive of the cost of the Calcutta and locally-purchased grain, and of the carriage of the former by rail. A large proportion of this expenditure,\nhowever, consisted of advances, which were intended to be recovered, and have since been partially realized.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The principal manufacture of the District is indigo, of which the annual out-turn is 125 tons, selling in ordinary years for about \u00a370,000. The weaving of tasar silk cloth gives employment to a considerable number of persons in the District, but this industry appears to be slowly dying out. Several kinds of coarse glass are made, and cotton-weaving and the manufacture of saltpetre are carried on to a limited extent. The trade of the District is yearly increasing, the principal exports being rice, wheat, gram, barley, Indian corn, oil-seeds, and dairy produce, and the chief imports, salt, sugar, and piece-goods; the exports largely exceed the imports in value. The chief wholesale business is with Lower Bengal, but there is also considerable traffic between Nep\u00e1l and Bh\u00e1galpur, the principal exports from Bh\u00e1galpur being rice and other cereals, and the chief imports, mustard-seed and paddy.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The revenue and expenditure of Bh\u00e1galpur have greatly increased since the beginning of the present century. In 1799, the net revenue of the District amounted to \u00a334,747, and the expenditure to \u00a355,226; by 1860\u201361 the revenue had increased to \u00a385,637, while the expenditure amounted to \u00a354,148; and in 1870\u201371, the net revenue was \u00a3139,535, and the net expenditure, \u00a380,323. In 1880\u201381, the total revenue was returned at \u00a3134,939, of which \u00a357,132 was contributed by the land tax, and \u00a335,421 by excise. The land revenue has varied very much from time to time, owing to changes in the extent of revenue jurisdiction. The assessment per acre is extremely low throughout the District, particularly on the north of the Ganges, while the value of land has increased enormously since the beginning of the century. During the same period, subdivision of property has also gone on very rapidly, the number of estates being thirty-fold, and the number of proprietors nearly eighty-fold, what it once was. Bh\u00e1galpur is divided for administrative purposes into four Sub-divisions\u2014the Sadr or head-quarters Sub-division (936 square miles in extent), B\u00e1nk\u00e1 (1185 square miles), Madahpur\u00e1 (872 square miles), and S\u00fap\u00fal (1275 square miles). There has been a steady increase in the machinery for the protection of person and property in the District. In 1780, there was only 1 magisterial and 1 civil and revenue court in Bh\u00e1galpur; in 1850 the number of magisterial courts was 4, and of civil courts, 10; in 1881, there were 11 magisterial and 6 civil courts. The District is divided for police purposes into 12 th\u00e1n\u00e1s or police circles. In 1880\u201381, the regular police force consisted of 2 superior and 74 subordinate officers, and 413 constables, maintained at a cost to Government of \u00a38648. In addition to these, there was a municipal police of 123 officers and men, costing \u00a3920;\nand a village watch or rural force of 3686 men, maintained by the villagers and landholders. The entire police force of the District, therefore, consisted in 1880 of 4298 officers and men, equal to an average of 1 man to every square mile or to every 457 persons. In the same year, the number of persons put on trial for 'cognisable' offences was 1574, of whom 1392 were convicted. There are 2 jails and 2 lock-ups in the District, the principal prison being at Bh\u00e1galpur town. The daily average number of prisoners in 1880 was 206. In 1856-57, the number of Government and aided schools was 10, with 358 pupils; in 1870-71, there were 12 such schools, with 750 pupils. An impetus has recently been given, however, to education in the District; and by 1873-74 the number of Government and aided schools had increased to 234, in consequence of the introduction of important changes in the system of primary education, whereby 222 schools received in that year small grants varying from 8s. to 10s. a month. The number of pupils attending these schools was 5972, of whom 5273 were Hindus and 692 Muhammadans. By 1880-81, the effect of Sir George Campbell's educational reforms, by extending Government assistance to indigenous education, had been to augment the number of aided primary schools under the supervision of the Educational Department to 2544 with 21,286 pupils.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014Malarious fevers, generally intermittent but sometimes also remittent, are endemic in the District, chiefly in the northern Division. They are most prevalent during the rains and in the beginning of the cold weather, and 55 per cent. of the mortality of the District is attributed in the returns to this cause. Dysentery and diarrhoea are always very prevalent; and among the other common diseases of the District are scurvy, jaundice, leprosy, bronchitis, and asthma. The most common of the deadly epidemics is cholera, but Bh\u00e1galpur, although it is every now and then visited by severe outbreaks, does not suffer so seriously as some of the neighbouring Districts\u2014a fact attributed to the small number of fairs and religious gatherings which are held, and to the comparatively scanty attendance at those which do take place. The curious fever known as 'dengue' broke out for the first time in Bh\u00e1galpur in 1872, and, as usual with this disease, spread throughout the District very rapidly. Small-pox prevails to a considerable extent, but vaccination is gradually finding more favour with the natives. There are 7 charitable dispensaries in the District\u2014one main dispensary at Bh\u00e1galpur, and branches at B\u00e1nk\u00e1, Colgong, Madahpur\u00e1, N\u00e1thnagar, S\u00fap\u00fal, and Prat\u00e1pganj. They afforded medical relief in 1880 to 573 in-door, and 16,063 out-door patients. The average annual rainfall is returned at 47\u00b749 inches. In 1881, the rainfall registered 42\u00b767 inches, or 4\u00b782 inches below the average. No official thermometrical returns are available.

Station on the loop line of the East Indian Railway; distance from Calcutta, 265 miles; by river, 326 miles. Within the town and its neighbourhood (at Champanagar) are some interesting Muhammadan shrines, and two remarkable places of worship, belonging to the Jain sect of Osw\u00e1ls, one of them erected by the great banker of the last century, Jagat Seth. The Karnagarh Plateau, near the town, formerly contained the lines of the 'Bh\u00e1galpur Hill Rangers,' organized by Cleveland in 1780 (vide Santal Parganas). It continued in their possession until 1863, when the battalion was disbanded, and is now held by a wing of a Native Infantry regiment. The town contains two monuments to the memory of Mr. Augustus Cleveland, sometime Collector of Bh\u00e1galpur District, one of brick, erected by the landholders of the District; the other of stone, sent out by the Court of Directors of the East India Company from England. An attempt has been made to prove that Bh\u00e1galpur occupies the site of the ancient Palibothra, but there seems no reason to doubt the generally accepted identification of that city with Patn\u00e1. Bh\u00e1galpur figures more than once in Muhammadan chronicles of the 16th century. Akbar's troops marched through the town when invading Bengal in 1573 and 1575. In Akbar's second war against the Afgh\u00e1n King of Bengal, his general M\u00e1n Singh made Bh\u00e1galpur the rendezvous of all the Behar contingents, which in 1592\nwere sent thence over Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur to Bardw\u00e1n, where they met the Bengal levies, and the united army invaded Orissa. The town was subsequently made the seat of an imperial faujd\u00e1r or military governor.\n\n**Bh\u00e1galpur.**\u2014Town in Gorakhpur District, North-Western Provinces, on the left bank of the Gogra, 54 miles south-east of Gorakhpur town. Lat. 26\u00b0 10' N., long. 83\u00b0 52' E. An ancient town, which formerly gave its name to a pargan\u00e1, and is said to have been the birth-place and residence of Parasu R\u00e1ma, an incarnation of Vishnu. A stone pillar (attributed by some to Parasu R\u00e1ma, and by others to Bhim Singh) and several ruins exist in the neighbourhood. Population (1881) 2679.\n\n**Bh\u00e1gamandal.**\u2014Village in Padinalkn\u00e1d taluk, Coorg, Madras Presidency, with a ruined fort. Lat. 12\u00b0 23' N., long. 75\u00b0 36' E. The place is memorable for the conspicuous part it took in the wars between the Coorg R\u00e1j\u00e1 and Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n. The fort was besieged and captured by Tip\u00fa in 1785, where he seized some 5000 Coorgs with their families, whom he sent to Mysore and forcibly made Muhammads. Bh\u00e1gamandal fort was recaptured by the Coorg R\u00e1j\u00e1, Dodda Vira Rajendra, in 1790. There is a temple of some importance, endowed by Government with \u00a3232 a year, together with \u00a3395, 12s. for the choultry, and visited by pilgrims proceeding to the source of the K\u00e1veri 5 miles farther on.\n\n**Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed.**\u2014River of Bengal; a branch of the Ganges, which it leaves at Chh\u00e1ph\u00e1ti, near the police station of S\u00fat\u00ed in Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d District. Flowing in a southerly direction, it divides Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d into two almost equal portions, and leaves the District below the village of Bidhup\u00e1r\u00e1, close to the battle-field of Plassey. It then forms the boundary line between the Districts of Nadiy\u00e1 and Bardw\u00e1n, until it reaches Nadiy\u00e1 town. Here its waters are met by those of the Jalang\u00ed, and the united stream assumes the name of the Hugl\u00ed. Chief tributaries, all on the right bank\u2014in Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d, the united waters of the B\u00e1nsloi and P\u00e1gl\u00e1, and the Chor\u00e1 Dekr\u00e1; and in Bardw\u00e1n, the Ajai and the Khar\u00ed. Principal towns on the banks\u2014in Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d, Jang\u00edpur, Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d, Ji\u00e1ganj, and Berhampur; in Bardw\u00e1n, Katw\u00e1; in Nadiy\u00e1, Nadiy\u00e1 town. The course of the river frequently changes, and sandbanks and other obstructions are constantly being formed. A series of efforts has been made by Government to keep the channel clear for navigation; and during the hot weather a weekly register of its depth, as well as that of the other Nadiy\u00e1 rivers (the Jalang\u00ed and the M\u00e1t\u00e1bh\u00e1ng\u00e1), is published, as a guide to native merchants and boatmen.\n\nThis river is regarded by the Hindus as the sacred channel of the Ganges. The Hindu traditional account of the origin of the holy stream is as follows:\u2014King S\u00e1gar was the thirteenth ancestor of R\u00e1ma,\nand had ninety-nine times performed the *Aswamedha jajna* or great Horse Sacrifice, which consisted in sending a horse round the Indian world, with a defiance to any one to arrest its progress. If the horse returned unopposed, it was understood to be an acquiescence in the supremacy of the challenger, and the animal was then solemnly sacrificed to the gods. King S\u00e1gar made preparations for the hundredth performance of this ceremony, but the god Indra having himself performed the sacrifice, and jealous of being displaced by a rival, stole the horse and concealed it in a subterranean cell, where a holy sage was absorbed in heavenly meditation. The sixty thousand sons of S\u00e1gar traced the horse to its hiding-place, and believing the sage to be the author of the theft, assaulted him. The holy man, being thus aroused from his meditation, cursed his assailants, who were immediately reduced to ashes, and sentenced to hell. A grandson of S\u00e1gar, in search of his father and uncles, at last found out the sage, and begged him to redeem the souls of the dead. The holy man replied that this could only be effected if the waters of Gang\u00e1 (the aqueous form of Vishnu and Lakshmi) could be brought to the spot to touch the ashes. Now Gang\u00e1 was residing in heaven, under the care of Brahm\u00e1 the Creator, and the grandson of S\u00e1gar prayed him to send the goddess to the earth. He was unsuccessful, however, and died without his supplication being granted. He left no issue, but a son, Bh\u00e1g\u00edrath, was miraculously born of his widow, and through his prayers Brahm\u00e1 allowed Gang\u00e1 to visit the earth. Bh\u00e1g\u00edrath led the way to near the sea, and then declared that he could not show the rest of the road. Whereupon, Gang\u00e1, in order to make sure of reaching the bones of the dead, divided herself into a hundred mouths, thus forming the delta of the Ganges. One of these mouths arrived at the cell, and by washing the ashes, completed the atonement for the sin of the sons of King S\u00e1gar.\n\n**Bh\u00e1g\u00edrath\u00ed.**\u2014River in Garhw\u00e1l State, North-Western Provinces (lat. 30\u00b0 8' 30\" to 30\u00b0 56' N., long. 78\u00b0 38' 15\" to 79\u00b0 6' 45\" E.); one of the head-waters of the Ganges; rises from the Gangotri Peak, in the Native State of Garhw\u00e1l; flows through a wild and rocky bed, with numerous shoals and rapids, and joins the Alaknanda at Deopray\u00e1g. Thenceforward the united stream is known as the Ganges. The Bh\u00e1g\u00edrathi, though inferior in importance and volume to the Alaknand\u00e1, is regarded among the Hindus as the chief feeder of the sacred stream, and is identified with the branch thrown off by the Ganges at Chh\u00e1pgh\u00e1t\u00ed more than 1000 miles below.\n\n**Bh\u00e1gwa.**\u2014Seaport in Surat District, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 21\u00b0 24' N., long. 72\u00b0 40' E. Average annual value of trade for five years ending 1881-82\u2014exports, \u00a32093; imports, \u00a31622.\n\n**Bhagw\u00e1ngol\u00e1.**\u2014River mart on the Ganges, in Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d\nDistrict, Bengal, 120 miles north of Calcutta. Lat. 24\u00b0 20' N., long. 88\u00b0 20' 38' E. There are in reality two villages of the name, five miles from each other, called New and Old Bhagw\u00e1ngol\u00e1. The latter was the port of Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d during Muhammadan rule, and is still much resorted to when the Ganges is in flood. At other times, owing to changes which have taken place in the course of the river, it is not accessible by boat, and the river traffic is confined to the new town. This latter is sometimes called Al\u00e1t\u00e1l\u00ed, and is a d\u00e9p\u00f4t for up-country produce, especially indigo seed. Old Bhagw\u00e1ngol\u00e1 is a police station.\n\n**Bhagwantnagar.**\u2014Parg\u00e1n\u00e1 in Un\u00e1o District, Oudh; bounded on the north by Bih\u00e1r, P\u00e1tan, and Magr\u00e1yar parg\u00e1n\u00e1s; on the east by Kh\u00edron and Sareni parg\u00e1n\u00e1s, on the south by Daundia Khera parg\u00e1n\u00e1, and on the west by Gh\u00e1tampur parg\u00e1n\u00e1. Watered by the small rivers Khari and Suw\u00e1wan, which both have their rise in this parg\u00e1n\u00e1, and which occasionally do considerable damage by inundations. Soil principally loam and clay. Area, 45 square miles, of which 19 are cultivated; population (1881) 25,623. Government land revenue, \u00a36771, averaging 4s. 8\u00bdd. per acre.

Of the 53 villages 25 are zamind\u00e1ri, 26 pattid\u00e1ri, 1 t\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri, and 1 revenue-free.\n\n**Bhagwantnagar.**\u2014Town in Un\u00e1o District, Oudh; 32 miles southeast of Un\u00e1o town, on the road from Baks\u00e1r to Bih\u00e1r. Founded by and named after Bhagwant Ku\u00e1r, the wife of R\u00e1o Raghun\u00e1th Singh, the B\u00e1\u00eds chief of Daundia Khera. Population (1881) 3557, namely, Hindus, 3289, and Muhammadans, 268. Six Hindu temples; vernacular school; post office; and registration office. Flourishing trade and manufacture of copper utensils.\n\n**Bhagwantnagar.**\u2014Town in Hardoi District, Oudh; 1 mile south of Mall\u00e1nw\u00e1n. Founded about 180 years ago by Aurangzeb\u2019s Hindu d\u00edv\u00e1n, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bhagwant R\u00e1i, who named it after himself. Population (1881) 1462, chiefly Br\u00e1hmans; number of houses, 219. Considerable manufacture of bell-metal plates and drinking vessels. Bi-weekly market.\n\n**Bhai.**\u2014Town in Dalmau tahs\u00edl, R\u00e1i Bareli District, Oudh; 3 miles west of Dalmau, on the road from that place to L\u00e1lganj, and 20 miles from R\u00e1i Bareli town. Picturesquely situated on rising ground, surrounded by numerous groves. Population (1881) 2714.\n\n**Bhainsror (Bhainsrorz\u00e1rh, B\u00e1nsror).**\u2014Town and fort in Mew\u00e1r or Uda\u00edpur (Oodeypore) State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na; situated on the summit of a lofty rock in the angle of confluence where the Bh\u00e1mani river falls into the Chambal. Lat. 24\u00b0 58' N., long. 75\u00b0 36' E. Distance (direct) from Udaipur (Oodeypore) 70 miles east-north-east; from Ujjain, 127 miles north. The rock varies from 300 to 700 feet in height above the average\nlevel of the river, by which its base is washed on all sides but the north. In this direction the fort is accessible, but the slope has been artificially scarped. The place could, without much difficulty, be reduced by shells; and even before the introduction of artillery, was taken by Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn, Path\u00e1n King of Delhi (1295\u20131315). The summit of the palace is 160 feet above the river, the water level of which is here 1009 feet above the sea. The town contains about 800 houses, and commands the sole passage of the Chambal for a great extent, and all the traffic between Mew\u00e1r and Haraoti passes through it. It is the residence of a first-class noble of the State, who owns 122 villages.\n\nAt Baroli, about 3 miles west of Bhainsrorgarh, are vast ruins of ancient temples dedicated to Siva. According to local tradition, the ancient name of Baroli was Bhadr\u00e1oti, the seat of the Huns, and the traces of an old city, in extensive mounds and ruins, are still to be seen around the more modern Bhainsror. These stupendous temples have been fully described by Tod, but no date has been found for their erection. \u2018It is evident, however,\u2019 says Tod, \u2018that the whole was not accomplished within one man\u2019s existence, nor could the cost be defrayed by one year\u2019s revenue of all R\u00e1jput\u00e1na.\u2019\n\n**Bhainsw\u00e1l.** \u2014 Village in Muzaffarnagar District, North-Western Provinces; distant from Muzaffarnagar town 27 miles. Population (1881) 2830; more than 100 brick-built houses, owned chiefly by J\u00e1ts, Br\u00e1hmans, and Baniy\u00e1s. The village lies very low, close to and west of the main channel of the Eastern Jumna Canal; in the rains it is entirely surrounded by water, and there is a good deal of sickness in consequence. In the centre of the village is a mound 30 feet high, said to contain the grave of P\u00edr Gh\u00e1ib, the founder. Branch post-office.\n\n**Bhair\u00e1b\u00ed.** \u2014 River in Darrang District, Assam, flowing south from the Ak\u00e1 Hills in a tortuous course, and falling into the Brahmaputra. It is navigable throughout the year in its course through British territory, by large country boats, of about four tons burthen, and is nowhere fordable. The stream is said to bring down gold dust.\n\n**Bhairagni\u00e1.** \u2014 Village and large grain and oil-seed d\u00e9p\u00f4t in Muzaffarpur District, Bengal; situated on the Nep\u00e1l frontier, on the east bank of the L\u00e1l Bakya river, a tributary of the B\u00e1ghmat\u00ed. Lat. 26\u00b0 44\u2032 N., long. 85\u00b0 22\u2032 E. The Nep\u00e1l trade changes hands at this place, where the dealers of the plains meet the hillmen. A registering station for traffic was opened here in the beginning of 1876, and a police station in 1877. The town is increasing in importance, and new shops are opening. Population (1881) 1589, namely, Hindus, 1453, and Muhammadans, 136.\n\n**Bhairogh\u00e1t\u00ed.** \u2014 Temple and pass in Garhw\u00e1l State, North-Western Provinces; confluence of the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed with the Jahn\u00e1vi, in a deep gorge, confined by perpendicular walls of granite; considered a place\nof great sanctity, and visited by Hindu pilgrims from all parts of India.

Area, 12 square miles; population in 1881, 4073, namely, 4002 Hindus, and 71 Muhammadans; revenue, \u00a31100. It is a rule of succession in the K\u00e1linjar family, that when heirs fail to any sharer, the share is divided among the surviving branches of the family. The share of Bhaisaunda is held by Chaub\u00ed Tirat Pras\u00e1d, who is a Hindu and a Br\u00e1hman. The j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1r has about 80 foot soldiers.\n\n**Bhajji.**\u2014One of the Hill States in political subordination to the Punjab Government, lying between 31\u00b0 7' 30\" and 31\u00b0 17' 45\" N. lat., and between 77\u00b0 2' 30\" and 77\u00b0 23' 15\" E. long. The R\u00e1n\u00e1, or chief, is a R\u00e1jput. The founder of the family came from Kangra and acquired possession of the State by conquest. The Gurkh\u00e1s overran the country between 1803 and 1815, and were expelled by the British Government, on which the R\u00e1n\u00e1 was confirmed in possession of his State by sanad. Area, 96 square miles; revenue, \u00a32300. Population (1881) 12,106, namely, 6720 males and 5386 females. Hindus numbered 12,054, Sikhs 7, and Muhammadans 45; number of villages, 327. An annual tribute of \u00a3144 is paid to the British. Sentences of death passed by the R\u00e1n\u00e1 require confirmation; other punishments are awarded on his own authority.\n\n**Bhakkar.**\u2014Tahsil of Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n District, Punjab, lying along the eastern bank of the Indus; only slowly reclaimed and colonized by J\u00e1t and Baluch settlers within the last three centuries. The tahsil is naturally divided into two portions, (1) the thal, forming part of the sandy plain of the Sind S\u00e1g\u00e1r Do\u00e1b; and (2) the kach\u00ed, or low alluvial lands on the Indus. Area, 3114 square miles; population (1881) 112,429, namely, males 60,989, and females 51,440; persons per square mile, 36.

The town is situated on the left bank of the Indus, on the edge of the thal or sandy plain overlooking the kach\u00ed, or low-lying alluvial lands along the Indus, a channel of which is navigable as far as Bhakkar during the floods. To\nthe west of the town, the land is low, well cultivated, and subject to inundation, while to the east the land is high and dry, treeless and sandy. There is a rich extent of land under well cultivation below the town, protected by embankments from inundations of the Indus, and which grows two or three crops in the year. The neighbouring kach\u00ed is full of date groves and fruit gardens, and in it stands a famous mango tree, the fruit of which used to be sent to Kabul in the old days of Afgh\u00e1n rule. Bhakkar was founded probably towards the close of the 15th century by a body of colonists from Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n, led by a Baluch adventurer, whose descendants long held the surrounding country, till ousted by the grantees of Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Dur\u00e1ni. The town contains, besides the ordinary tahs\u00edl courts, a dispensary, middle school, travellers' bungalow, and sar\u00e1i (native inn). The trade is purely local. A Government garden with a plantation of fine shisham trees is situated just outside the town.\n\n**Bhalal\u00e1.**\u2014Petty State of Jh\u00e1law\u00e1r in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency; consisting of one village, with 3 independent tribute-payers.

Lat. 20\u00b0 13\u2032 30\u2033 N., long. 78\u00b0 3\u2032 E.; 16 miles south of Yeotmal. Vast stone ruins, covering a large area, bear witness to the city camps which followed the standard of Ragh\u00faji Bhonsla. Tradition relates that of Bair\u00e1g\u00eds (religious mendicants) alone there were at one time no fewer than 5000 houses. The site was till lately covered with dense jungle; but in 1876\nit was given on lease, and a new agricultural village is now springing up on the site of the old town, and the dense jungle is nearly cleared away. According to the recent Census of 1881, the number of inhabited houses was returned at 51, and the population (which is increasing) at 269.\n\n**Bh\u00e1mbores (Bambura).**\u2014Ruined city near the town of Gharo, in the N\u00farpur Sakro tal\u00edk, Kar\u00e1chi (Kurrachee) District, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 24\u00b0 40' N., long. 67\u00b0 41' E. It was once fortified, and was known as the K\u00e1f\u00edr or Infidel city, with temples of sanctity, but was stormed by the Muhammadans in their first invasion in 711 A.D. Tradition preserves its old name as Debal, Dewal or Dawal, the temple; but it is believed that before the Musalm\u00e1n invasion it was known under the name of the Mahara or Mansawar. The ruins, as also the numerous coins found on the site, attest its former population and importance.\n\n**Bh\u00e1mgarh.**\u2014Town in Nim\u00e1r District, Central Provinces; 8 miles east of Khandw\u00e1 town.

Contains about 470 houses, scattered over a large extent of ground; and surrounded, except on the west, by ancient groves and jungle. Tradition runs that here stood the great city of Bhadr\u00e1vat\u00ed, mentioned in the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata, extending from Bhat\u00e1l\u00e1 to the Jharpat, the scene of the battle for the S\u00e1mkarna horse. The demi-god Bh\u00edma, whose footprint is still pointed out on the Dew\u00e1l\u00e1 Hill, bore away the horse for sacrifice by Dharma, the king. The temple-caves at Bh\u00e1ndak and in the Dew\u00e1l\u00e1 and Winjh\u00e1san\u00ed Hills, the traces of forts on those hills, the temple of Bhadr\u00e1vat\u00ed, the foundations of the king's palace, the bridge over a now dried-up lake, and numerous ruined temples and tanks, testify to the existence here of a great city in the remote past. The town carries on but little trade.\nIt has a Government school for boys, a police station-house, post-office and a sar\u00e1\u00ed. The residents are chiefly gardeners.\n\n**Bhand\u00e1r\u00e1.**\u2014District in the N\u00e1gpur Division of the Chief Commissionership of the Central Provinces, lying between $20^\\circ 38' 30''$ and $21^\\circ 44'$ N. lat., and between $79^\\circ 29' 30''$ and $80^\\circ 43'$ E. long.; bounded on the north by Seoni and B\u00e1lg\u00e1h\u00e1t, on the south by Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, on the east by R\u00e1ipur, and on the west by N\u00e1gpur. Population in 1881, 683,779; area, 3922 square miles. The administrative head-quarters are at Bhandara, which is also the principal town.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014Towards the west, Bhand\u00e1r\u00e1 stretches out in an open plain to the banks of the Waingang\u00e1, which flows along about half the length of the western border; on the north and east, hills, inhabited chiefly by Gonds and other wild tribes, shut it in. Upwards of one-third of the District is covered with jungle. Few of its mountains attain to any considerable size. Several small forest-clad ranges, branching from the great S\u00e1tpura chain, run into the interior, generally in a southerly direction. Another low range, known as the Ambagarh or Sendurjhari, skirts the south of the Ch\u00e1ndpur pargan\u00e1. The only isolated peaks worthy of notice are the Bah\u00e1hi, Kanheri, and Naw\u00e1g\u00e1on Hills. These consist mostly of granitic rock, but near the Waingang\u00e1 sandstone shows itself in patches among the heights on the west bank of the G\u00e1rv\u00ed and B\u00e1gh rivers. In the upper portion of the course of the B\u00e1gh, porphyry is extensively disclosed, with crystals of quartz, and of white and sometimes red felspar, imbedded in a dark mass of the same materials. Of the rivers of Bhand\u00e1r\u00e1, the Waingang\u00e1 alone retains water through the hot season. Into the Waingang\u00e1 fall the B\u00e1wanthari, the B\u00e1gh, the Kanh\u00e1n, and the Chulban, the only other important streams in the District. But it is the lakes and tanks, of which there are upwards of 5000, that form the most striking feature of Bhand\u00e1r\u00e1. By taking advantage of the dips and hollows afforded by an undulating country, or by excavating artificial basins and throwing long dams across sloping ground, sheets of water, often of enormous size, have been formed. \u2018These tanks,\u2019 writes a former Chief Commissioner, Sir Richard Temple, \u2018are so numerous and some of them so large, being many miles in circumference, that this tract might almost be called the lake region of N\u00e1gpur. Here a tank is not a piece of water with regular banks, crowned with rows or avenues of trees, with an artificial dyke and sluices, and with fields around it, but it is an irregular expanse of water; its banks are formed by rugged hills covered with low forests that fringe the water, where the wild beasts repair to drink; its dykes, mainly shaped out of spurs from the hill, are thrown athwart the hollows, a part only being formed by masonry; its sluices often consist of chasms or fissures in the rock; its broad surface is often, as the monsoon approaches, lashed with surging and crested\nwaves.' The principal lakes bear the names of Naw\u00e1g\u00e1on, Seoni, and Sireg\u00e1on, the former covering an area of $5\\frac{1}{2}$ square miles, and being 17 miles in circumference. The forest tracts do not contain much valuable timber of a large size fit for building purposes, except the mah\u00fadi trees, which are preserved by the people for their flowers, used as an article of diet by the poorer classes, and also distilled into a country spirit. The jungles yield gum, medicinal fruits and nuts, edible fruits, and honey, which are gathered and sold by the Gond tribes. The mineral products include iron, which is found in many places, and constitutes an article of export. The mines are mere pits, being generally only ten or twelve feet deep; and the clay furnaces for smelting the ore are very primitive and inefficient. The smelters are principally Gonds, Go\u00e1r\u00e1s, Pardh\u00e1ns, and Dhim\u00e1rs, from whom middlemen purchase the iron in rough slabs. Geri, a kind of red ochre, is found and used for dyeing wool and cloth. Building stone is abundant. Owing to the large extent of forest, wild animals abound. The tiger and the panther cause a great destruction of human life; and during the rainy season many persons die from the bites of venomous snakes. Ninety deaths from these causes were registered in the year 1882. Deer of all kinds and wild pigs swarm in the woods, and frequently inflict great injury upon the crops.\n\nHistory.\u2014Of the early history of Bhand\u00e1r\u00e1 nothing is known, except that the legendary Gaulis are said at some remote period to have overrun the country. The Gaul\u00eds of the present day are a wandering and pastoral race, who encamp in the jungles, and only visit the villages to sell their cattle or dairy produce, and to purchase provisions. Possibly the Muhammadan princes of the Deccan at one time included Bhand\u00e1r\u00e1 in their dominions, but not till the end of the 17th century can our information be relied upon. We then find the District under the rule of the Gond R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Deog\u00e1rh. Bakht Buland, the founder of the dynasty, purchased the support of Aurangzeb by his conversion to the Muhammadan faith. Under his government a number of R\u00e1jputs, Lodh\u00eds, Ponw\u00e1rs, Kor\u00eds, Kar\u00e1s, and Kumb\u00eds were attracted into the District, settling chiefly in the villages near the Waingang\u00e1. Their industry and agricultural skill greatly improved the country, especially in the region about Paun\u00ed. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s under Raghuji I. conquered these parts about 1738, but they were not formally administered from N\u00e1gpur until 1743. Under the Bhonslas a number of the commercial and soldier castes\u2014M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris, Agarw\u00e1l\u00e1s, Ling\u00e1yats, and Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Kumb\u00eds\u2014established themselves in the District. In 1817, when Ap\u00e1 Sah\u00edb was at war with the British, he sent the ladies of his palace, with his jewels and other valuables, for security to Bhand\u00e1r\u00e1. On the surrender of N\u00e1gpur, the English troops escorted them back to that city. The next year Chimn\u00e1 P\u00e1tel, zamind\u00e1r of the\nK\u00e1mth\u00e1 and War\u00fad t\u00e1luks, rebelled against the British Government, when Captain Gordon was deputed to K\u00e1mth\u00e1, and put a speedy end to the disturbance. The District was then administered by Captain Wilkinson, at first from K\u00e1mth\u00e1, but after 1820 from Bhand\u00e1r\u00e1. In 1830, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Raghuji III. attained his majority and succeeded to the government, which he continued to hold till his death in 1853. On the 11th October 1854, Captain C. Elliot was appointed Deputy Commissioner of the District, and since then the history of Bhand\u00e1r\u00e1 has been one of peaceful progress. During the Mutiny of 1857\u201358, the District remained perfectly tranquil. Three companies of infantry and a small body of horsemen were stationed at Bhand\u00e1r\u00e1 until 1860, but since that time the police have constituted the only armed force.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1872 disclosed a population of 564,813 persons, on an area of 3922 square miles. The later Census in 1881 gave a population of 683,779 on the same area, showing an increase of 118,966, or 21.06 per cent. in the nine years. This increase, however, is more apparent than real, and the Deputy Commissioner attributes one half to defective enumeration in the Census of 1872. The registered increase of births over deaths was 11.76 per cent. The Deputy Commissioner also pointed out that a considerable emigration had taken place of weavers, chiefly to Beh\u00e1r, and of brass workers, chiefly to Chhatisgarh. The District population in 1881 resided in 1612 towns and villages; number of houses, 141,114, of which 133,056 were inhabited and 8058 uninhabited; average density of population, 174 per square mile; number of houses, 34 per square mile; inmates per occupied house, 5.14. Divided according to sex, there were, males 340,811, and females 342,968. Classified according to religion, Hindus numbered 589,699; Sikhs, 12; Kabirpanthis, 2169; Satn\u00e1mis, 38; Muhammadans, 13,102; Christians, 157; Buddhist, 1; Jains, 576; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 4; aboriginal tribes, 78,021. The most numerous of the aboriginal tribes are the Gonds, who numbered 90,946, of whom 20,258 were returned as Hindus, the remaining 70,688 still professing their primitive faiths. The remaining aboriginal tribes consist of a few Kurk\u00fas, Kols, and others. Among the Hindus, Br\u00e1hmans in 1881 numbered 6,435, and R\u00e1jputs 7,994, the mass of the Hindu population consisting of Dhers or Mhars (113,589), Kurmis (79,036), Ponw\u00e1rs (53,990), Tel\u00eds (36,952), Goaris (42,796), K\u00e1l\u00e1rs (25,195), Dhim\u00e1rs (29,347), and other cultivating or inferior castes. The Muhammadan population divided according to sect consisted of\u2014Sunnis, 12,021; Shi\u00e1s, 286; unspecified, 795. Of the 157 Christians, 47 were Europeans or Americans, 6 Eurasians, 87 natives, and 17 unspecified. The Church of England numbered 43 adherents, Roman Catholics 53, and Presbyterians 29. The language in common use is Mar\u00e1th\u00ed, though from the neighbourhood of Urdu-\nspeaking regions, Urdu is understood generally through the District, and Urdu words and idioms have largely impaired the purity of the Mar\u00e1th\u00ed spoken in Bhand\u00e1r\u00e1. The Gonds and other castes use also their peculiar languages, intelligible only to themselves.\n\nThe inhabitants of Bhand\u00e1r\u00e1, even among the higher classes, have a reputation for bluntness and discourtesy; nor do they compensate for this defect by their candour or manliness. Indeed, the two proverbs most frequently in their mouths by no means tend to a practice of the virtues which are usually associated with a rude simplicity\u2014'Charity remains at home,' and 'The perfection of wisdom is deceit.' These are the favourite sentiments of a native of Bhand\u00e1r\u00e1. Good treatment, however, will generally bring out honesty and industry among the Gonds, and the Ponw\u00e1rs make hard-working agriculturists. But the population generally have none of the hardy, active habits often found in Northern India. Rarely does a person of the higher rank mount a horse; for nearly every journey, long or short, he has recourse to a small two-wheeled ox-cart. And it is not easy to get a fair day's work out of the labourer. Cheap food and a stationary population, a mild, equable climate, and a landlocked District without roads, have doubtless contributed to produce these characteristics; but as the country is being opened up, greater activity already manifests itself. Marriage is lightly regarded among the lower castes in Bhand\u00e1r\u00e1, particularly the Ponw\u00e1rs, Lodh\u00eds, and Kumb\u00eds. In this licence the women take the lead, often divorcing themselves from their husbands, and selecting of their own free will successive partners, without any opposition from their lawful lords. All, except the higher castes of Hindus, practise the ceremony called p\u00e1t, resembling the nik\u00e1 marriage common among Muhammadans, by which, after the death of a first husband or wife, a pair agree to live together. In this District, contrary to the general custom, girls receive more honour than boys; and the usual method of betrothals is reversed, as the relatives of a boy are fain to supplicate the parents of the girl whose hand they would win, instead of being sought after themselves. The general ignorance discovers itself in the loose notions entertained by the people regarding the respect due to the various Hindu divinities. Phallic worship is almost universal throughout the District; and all kinds of quadrupeds, and various reptiles, receive the adoration of their several votaries. Remarkable sepulchres become objects of reverence; and a large tomb near the village of Murm\u00e1ri, about 10 miles from Bhand\u00e1r\u00e1, where rest the remains of an English lady, is held in great veneration by the surrounding villagers. The few Muhammadans in the District are notorious for neglect of their religious duties, and for their disorderly and dissipated life.\n\nFour towns in Bhand\u00e1r\u00e1 each have a population exceeding 5000,\nviz. Bhandara, the District capital (11,150), Pauni (9773), Tumsar (7388), and Mohari (5142). Towns of 1000 to 5000 inhabitants number 109; from 200 to 1000, 916; villages containing fewer than 200 inhabitants, 587. The four large towns constitute the only municipalities. As regards the occupations of the people, the Census Report divides the male population into the following six main classes:\u2014(1) Professional class, including Government officers and the learned professions, 6735; (2) domestic servants, etc., 2735; (3) commercial class, including merchants, general dealers, carriers, etc., 4441; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 146,025; (5) manufacturing, artisan, and other industrial classes, 59,687; (6) indefinite and non-productive (comprising 3575 labourers, and 117,613 unspecified, including children), 121,188.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Of the total area of 3922 square miles in 1880\u201381, only 1230 are cultivated, and of the portion lying waste, 1183 are returned as cultivable; 301,045 acres of the cultivated land are irrigated, entirely by private enterprise. The Government assessment is at the rate of 1s. 1d. per acre of cultivated land, or 6\u00bdd. on the cultivable land. Rice constitutes the staple crop, no less than 468,431 acres being devoted to this purpose; wheat, 80,686 acres; other food-grains, 307,803. Oil-seeds occupy 56,966 acres. Sugar-cane is also extensively cultivated. The beginning and the end of the rains are the sowing times. The chief autumn crop is rice; the chief spring crops are wheat and gram. In northern Bhandar\u00e1, as soon as the rice harvest has been garnered, the husbandmen cut the dam, let the water out of the tank, and sow wheat or linseed in the bed; this appears the only means they have of raising a dry crop in the District. They sow their rice in three different ways: Bot\u00e1 is simple broadcast sowing; kaurak, is sowing broadcast in a prepared field, after steeping the unhulled rice in hot water, and then leaving it to germinate (this mode is only adopted when the sowing happens to be late); the third mode is called nond,\u2014a nursery of young rice is first formed in a well-manured piece of ground, and the seedlings are then transplanted to a field prepared as for the kaurak sowing, being placed at intervals of about an inch from each other. The Kohris or cultivators of the sugar-cane deserve special mention, as among the most industrious, thrifty, and intelligent cultivators. Nearly the whole of the extensive sugar-cane cultivation of the District is in their hands. Wherever Kohri cultivators are settled, a large irrigation tank is invariably found, and their eye for the levels of the surrounding country and their sagacity in constructing tanks and water-courses are almost marvellous. Irrigation is resorted to and manure used only for the cultivation of rice, vegetables, sugar-cane, and betel. The Census of 1881 returned a total of 5940 proprietors. The tenants-at-will numbered 46,464,\nwhile those having occupancy rights at either fixed or variable rates numbered 15,147. In 1880 the average rent per acre of land suited for rice was 1s. 4\u00bdd.; for wheat, 1s. 4\u00bdd.; for inferior grain, 9d.: the average produce per acre being, rice, 480 lbs.; wheat, 380 lbs.; and inferior grain, 208 lbs. The average number of acres cultivated in 1881 by each head of the agricultural population (258,668, or 37\u00b783 per cent. of the District population), was 6 acres; the amount of Government land revenue and local cesses levied on the landholders was \u00a343,029; and the amount of rental, including cesses, paid by the cultivators was \u00a376,465, or an average of 1s. 10\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. Rice sold for 6s. 10\u00bdd. per cwt., and wheat for 5s. 5d. per cwt. In the same year wages averaged for skilled labour 1s. 6d. per diem, for unskilled labour 4\u00bdd. per diem, being 2d. or 3d. higher than the rates of four years earlier. Carts, with which Bhandar\u00e1 is particularly well stocked, may be hired at 1s. 6d. a day. Besides its crops, the District yields jungle produce of some value, especially gums and honey, the gathering of which is almost entirely in the hands of the Gonds. The timber is of little worth, as the trees rarely attain a large size.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014Cloth, and brass, and potstone wares constitute the chief manufactures of the District. Paun\u00ed formerly produced cloth of singularly fine quality; but the manufacture has now almost ceased, as the weaving classes are day by day decreasing in numbers, and there is now but a small demand for such cloth. A turban of the best sort made to order sometimes costs as much as \u00a320. The original makers of these magnificent cloths are said to have come to these parts on the invitation of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gpur at the beginning of this century, from Paithan on the God\u00e1vari, and from Burh\u00e1npur on the T\u00e1pt\u00ed. They now bear the name of Kosht\u00eds. Of late years, the competition of English piece-goods and the rise in the value of cotton have diminished the price of the inferior kinds of cloth; but the export trade from this town to N\u00e1gpur, Poona, and Bombay is still considerable. Paun\u00ed also produces brass-ware, but Bhandar\u00e1 is the most important seat of this manufacture, sending its exports to N\u00e1gpur, R\u00e1ipur, and Jabalpur (Jubbulpore). The potstone-wares consist of cups, plates, and pipe-bowls, made chiefly at Kanheri and Pendri. Cotton, dyes, and salt from Berar, wheat and rice from R\u00e1ipur, English piece-goods from Bombay and Mirz\u00e1pur, silk from Burh\u00e1npur, and cattle from Sconi and Mandl\u00e1 Districts, form the chief imports. The direction of the trade is chiefly\u2014to and from N\u00e1gpur and R\u00e1ipur by the Great Eastern Road, which enters the District on the west, and, passing through Bhandar\u00e1, crosses the river B\u00e1gh by a substantial bridge into R\u00e1ipur District;\u2014and partly by a route through Pal\u00e1nd\u00far; to and from K\u00e1mthi (Kamptee) by the Tums\u00e1r route; and towards\nMandla by Hatta and K\u00e1mtha. In 1881, 142,503 carts laden with grain and merchandise from the Chhatt\u00edsgarh country paid duty at the toll gates on the Great Eastern Road. In 1877, the year of the famine in Southern India, as many as 36,000 carts paid toll in a single week. It was mainly by this road that the plentiful food crops of Chhatt\u00edsgarh in 1876 and 1877 were made available for the famine-stricken tracts of Southern India and the Deccan. In 1881 there were 58 miles of made roads. Small country carts and pack-bullocks supply the means of carrying on the existing traffic. The rocky barriers in the bed of the Waingang\u00e1 at Chichg\u00e1on, and in the bed of the B\u00e1gh at Saton\u00e1, limit the water communication during the rains to the interior of the District. The boats employed on these rivers consist of large logs of teak scooped out and lashed together. The N\u00e1gpur-Chhatt\u00edsgarh railway, now (1883) approaching completion, intersects the District, passing Bhand\u00e1r\u00e1 town at a distance of 6\u00bd miles. It enters the District at Dhaiw\u00e1ra, by means of a fine girder bridge across the Waingang\u00e1. It then proceeds to Tirora, Gondia (where there is a d\u00e1k bungalow), and Ambg\u00e1on, and passes through the Darck\u00e1s\u00e1 tunnel, 750 feet long, near a beautiful waterfall. After leaving the hills, it enters on the plains of Chhat\u00fasgarh at Dongargarh.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1854, Bhand\u00e1r\u00e1 was formed into a separate District of the British Government of the Central Provinces. It is administered by a Deputy Commissioner, with assistants and tahs\u00edld\u00e1rs. Revenue in 1868\u201369\u2014Land revenue, \u00a340,894; stamps, \u00a33775; excise, \u00a35592; assessed taxes, \u00a35051; and forests, \u00a32553. The settlement of land revenue for the District was concluded in 1867, and the low rate at which it was fixed has greatly encouraged cultivation. The payment is made by two instalments, in April and January. In 1876\u201377, the total revenue amounted to \u00a357,526, of which the land revenue yielded \u00a340,681. Total revenue in 1880\u201381, \u00a368,470, of which \u00a340,403 was derived from the land. Under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 reign there were no established courts of law, but the p\u00e1tels administered justice according to their own idea of what was right. In succession cases, the nationality determined the law to be followed. Suits exceeding \u00a3100 in value, however, generally came before the R\u00e1j\u00e1. Both plaintiff and defendant paid to the Government a fee of one-fourth. Among the lower classes the heads of castes, styled sety\u00e1s, and on an appeal an assembly of sety\u00e1s, decided civil cases. The plaintiff provided victuals and tobacco, or if a Gond, liquor, for the court; and an image of Mah\u00e1deva set upon a platform gave the sanctity of an oath to any statement there made. Thieves and burglars were punished by confiscation of goods, imprisonment in irons, or detention in the stocks. Second offences incurred mutilation of hands, nose, and fingers. Women who murdered their husbands generally had their noses\nmutilated. The total cost of District officials and police of all kinds amounted in 1880-81 to \u00a311,236. Number of civil and revenue judges of all sorts within the District, 7\u2014magistrates, 7; maximum distance of any village from the nearest court, 56\u2014average distance, 30 miles; number of regular and municipal police, 434, costing \u00a35555, being 1 policeman to every 9 square miles and to every 1575 inhabitants. In 1880, the daily average number of convicts in jail was 95\u00b798, of whom 11\u00b732 were females. Unpolished as they are, the inhabitants of Bhandar\u00e1 have shown themselves more than usually sensible of the value of education. Twenty-eight private schools in the large towns and 27 in the villages supplied instruction, the teachers being Br\u00e1hmans or Vid\u00fars, the illegitimate descendants of Br\u00e1hmans, either in the Persian or the Mar\u00e1thi language. In some cases, these old town and village schools served as foundations for the existing institutions on the introduction of the present system of education. In 1881, the Government or aided schools under Government inspection, all of which have been established since 1864, numbered 53, attended by 3987 pupils.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014In 1871, the rainfall at the civil station was 55\u00b797 inches; in 1876 it amounted only to 38\u00b715 inches; in 1880 it was 61 inches. In the latter year the temperature in the shade was thus recorded:\u2014May, highest reading 111\u00b0 F., lowest 75\u00b755\u00b0; July, highest reading 90\u00b0, lowest 67\u00b0; December, highest reading 83\u00b0, lowest 37\u00b0. The most deadly disease is fever, which prevails throughout the year, but proves most fatal during the months of September, October, and November. Nearly 80 per cent. of the deaths must be attributed to this cause. Bowel complaints carry off large numbers; and small-pox, owing to the little progress as yet made by vaccination, commits great ravages, more especially during the months of April, May, and June. In 1880, the registered death-rate from all causes was 30\u00b758 per 1000 of the population. Three charitable dispensaries afford medical relief to the poor.

On the hill above, remains of tanks, wells, and temples, apparently mark the ancient site of a Buddhist monastery; carved granite stones of like origin do service in the town as door-steps or pillars. The principal mosque, built during the reign of Aurangzeb, consists in large part of Buddhist columns. Trade and population declining under pressure of cholera and famine, which have caused emigration to more favoured tracts. The town contains many ruined or vacant houses.

The jagirdar, who is a Gond, receives an annual allowance of \u00a38, 10s. in lieu of pilgrim tax, and pays a tribute of \u00a33, 10s. His head-quarters are at Tikadhana or Panjra, a small village of 341 inhabitants, in the south-west of the estate.\n\n**Bh\u00e1rejda.** \u2014 Petty State of Jh\u00e1law\u00e1r District, in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency; consisting of 1 village, with 2 independent tribute-payers.

Remarkable for its caverns and subterranean water-courses and fountains, one of which, the Ach\u00e1b\u00e1d spring, is supposed to be the efflux of the engulfed water of the Bharengi river. The route by the M\u00edrbal pass runs up the valley.\n\n**Bharengi.** \u2014 River of Kashm\u00edr State, draining the Bhareng valley *(vide supra)*, being formed by the junction of the southern waters from the Wardwan Pass with the north-western outflow from the Snowy Punjab; partly disappears in a subterranean opening, and is said to reappear in the Ach\u00e1b\u00e1d spring. Length about 40 miles.\n\n**Bh\u00e1rgav\u00ed.** \u2014 River in Pur\u00ed District, Bengal; a branch of the Koy\u00e1kh\u00e1i, one of the distributaries of the Mah\u00e1n\u00e1di. Leaving the Koy\u00e1kh\u00e1i near Sard\u00e1ipur village, it flows in a southerly direction until it reaches a point 6 or 7 miles from the coast, when it turns abruptly to the west, and empties itself into the Chilka Lake. It is navigable throughout the rains, when, like the other rivers of Orissa, it frequently overflows its banks, flooding a large portion of the neighbouring country.\n\n**Bharthna.** \u2014 Central tahsil of Et\u00e1wah District, North-Western Provinces; comprising a narrow strip of territory running from north to south, and including part of the Do\u00e1b uplands, the Jumna valley, and the wild ravine-clad region along the banks of the Chambal and the Ku\u00e1ri n\u00e1di. Intercepted by Et\u00e1wah and Bhognipur Branch Canal and East Indian Railway. Area, 415 square miles, of which 215 are cultivated; population (1881) 161,446; land revenue, \u00a330,803; total revenue, \u00a334,651; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a357,572; incidence of Government revenue per acre, 2s. 3\u00bdd. In 1883, the tahsil contained 2 criminal courts, with 4 police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s); strength of regular police, 62 men; village watchmen (chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs), 333.\n\n**Bharthna.** \u2014 Village in Et\u00e1wah District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of Bharthna tahsil, 12 miles from Et\u00e1wah town, and\na railway station on the East Indian Railway. The place was selected as the head-quarters of the tahsil on account of its central position, but is otherwise unimportant. The Government offices, together with the police station, distillery, post-office, sarai, and market, lie on the north of the railway line close to the station, the village itself being a quarter of a mile to the north. A market for the sale of country produce is held on Wednesdays and Saturdays.\n\n**Bhartpur (Bharatpur).**\u2014Native State in Rajputana, under the political superintendence of a Political Agent, subordinate to the Agent to the Governor-General of India for the States of Rajputana; lying between $26^\\circ 42'$ and $27^\\circ 49'$ N. lat., and between $76^\\circ 54'$ and $77^\\circ 48'$ E. long. It is bounded on the north by the British District of Gurgaon; on the east by the Districts of Muttra and Agra; on the south-east, south, and south-west by the native States of Dholpur, Karauli (Kerowlee), and Jaipur (Jeypore); and on the west by Alwar (Ulwur). It is about 77 miles in length from north to south, and 63 miles in breadth; area, 1974 square miles. Population (1881) 645,540.\n\nThe general appearance of the State is flat and rather low, especially towards the north, the average height of the surface being about 600 feet above the sea, and about 50 feet above the water surface of the Jumna. The uniform character of the country is interrupted by detached hills in the north and south, and by low ranges on some parts of the western and south-eastern frontier, but the general aspect is an alluvial plain, fairly wooded. In the rains, owing to the low level, a considerable amount of surface is flooded. The soil of a great part is hard and dry, and in places much deteriorated by sand. The State suffers from want of water, but is made productive by the industry of its inhabitants.\n\nThe geological formation of Bhartpur is almost entirely of the sedimentary class, and the exposed rocks may be divided into three classes\u2014the alluvial; the series called Vindhyan, which occur in the range running from Fatehpur Sikri towards Hindaun; and the quartzite. About 13 miles west of Biana, near the town of Nilhara, are two small hills of a peculiar breccia, probable representatives of the Khaimur conglomerate.\n\nThe principal hills of the State are a low range forming the boundary between parganas Pahari and Gopalgarh, of Bhartpur and Firozpur and Alwar, running north and south, the highest point of which (Chapra) is 1222 feet. The Kalapahar, close to the Alwar frontier, contains the highest summit in Bhartpur, Mount Alipur, 1351 feet. The Sidgirpahar range runs on the south-eastern frontier in a direction north-east to south-west for a length of about 30 miles, the highest point, Usera, being 817 feet; in it are situated the celebrated Bans-\nPah\u00e1rpura stone quarries. This range becomes broken in the southern part, helping to form the District called the 'Dang.' Other heights are Damdama, 1215 feet, and Mount Ras\u00eda in the north, 1059 feet. About 3 miles distant from Bhartpur city is a ridge running north-east to south-west, about 3 miles long, the highest point of which, Madhoni, is 714 feet, a position with sufficient altitude to command the city with modern artillery.\n\nThe State is poor in mineral products, except building stone. No precious stones are found; but the stone from the south of Bhartpur, known geologically as Upper Bhanner sandstone, has furnished materials for the most celebrated monuments of the Mughal dynasty at Agra, Delhi, and Fatehpur S\u00edkri, as well as supplying the cities of Mathur\u00e1 (Muttra), Dig, and Bhartpur. The palaces at Dig, considered among the most beautiful in India, testify to the excellence of this stone. There are two monoliths near R\u00faph\u00e1s, which show the immense blocks the quarries yield\u2014one is a column 34' 6\" long, with an average diameter of 2' 11\"; the other a parallelopiped 42' 6\" \u00d7 5' 6\" \u00d7 4' on an average.\n\nThe State is scantily supplied with rivers, none of them being navigable or even perennial. The principal are the B\u00e1ngang\u00e1 or Utangan, rising in Jaipur and flowing through Bhartpur from west to east; the Ruparel, rising in Alwar territory; the Gamb\u00edr, rising in Jaipur; and the K\u00e1kand, rising in Karauli. The last two are subject to sudden rises, but are generally fordable.\n\nThe population of the State in 1881 was returned at 645,540, or 327.0 per square mile; classified according to religion, there were of Hindus, males 290,872, females 244,495; of Musalm\u00e1ns, males 57,180, females 48,486; and of Jains, 4499. By caste, Br\u00e1hmans were returned at 70,973; R\u00e1jputs, 6107; Baniy\u00e1, or trading class, 39,301; Gujars, 43,865; J\u00e1ts, 53,967; Ah\u00edrs, 5409; M\u00ednas, 12,139; Cham\u00e1rs, 88,584; and Dh\u00e1kurs, 5708.\n\nThe country is popularly known as Brij, or the land of Krishna, and the language, Brij-bh\u00e1sha, is a village patois. Bhartpur is the only J\u00e1t principality of any magnitude in India, and perhaps the only State in which a great proportion of the people belong to the same race as the nobles and princes. The chief towns are Bhartpur, Dig, Biana Wer Bhiwani, Kaman, Kumbher, R\u00faphas.\n\nHistory.\u2014Probably the first authentic information respecting the remote ancestors of the present possessor of Bh\u00e1rtpur is to be found in Ferishta, who states that in 1026 a band of J\u00e1ts molested Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed on his return from Gujar\u00e1t (Guzerat), and were nearly exterminated by him. In 1397, Tamerlane, marching towards Delhi, fell in with and massacred a horde of the same race, who were even then noted freebooters. In 1526, the army of B\u00e1bar was harassed by them\non his march through the Punjab. During the prosperity of the Mughal empire, the turbulence of their character brought upon them more than once the imperial wrath. The decline of the Mughal power, and the anarchy which followed the death of Aurangzeb, gave full scope for the play of their hardy and daring character. Under their chief, Ch\u00far\u00e1man, the founder of the present ruling house, they erected petty castles in the villages of Th\u00fan and Sinsiniw\u00e1r, the lands of which they cultivated. Ch\u00far\u00e1man was dispossessed by his brother Badan Singh, who was formally proclaimed at D\u00edg as leader of the J\u00e1ts with the title of Th\u00e1kur. Under the son of Badan Singh, Suraj Mall, the territory of the rising State was considerably extended. He was in favour with the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Jaipur, and held the forts of D\u00edg and Khumbher.\n\nBhartpur is first mentioned as a place of great strength about this time (1730). In 1754, Suraj Mall baffled the allied forces of the Waz\u00edr, Gh\u00e1z\u00ed-ud-d\u00edn, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Jaipur, though in the end he compounded with them by the payment of \u00a370,000. Six years later, he joined, at the head of 30,000 men, the great Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 confederacy, which, under Seodaseo Bh\u00e1o, marched to Delhi to oppose Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Dur\u00e1n\u00ed in his invasion of Hindust\u00e1n; but the incompetence of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 leader was so patent, and his insolence so galling to Suraj Mall, that he withdrew from the confederacy, and thus escaped the carnage of the defeat at P\u00e1n\u00edpat. It was during the confusion resulting from this battle that Suraj Mall obtained possession of Agra, by bribing the commander of the garrison. He was surprised and killed in 1763, leaving five sons, three of whom administered the State of Bhartpur in succession. During the reign of the third, Nawal Singh, the fourth son, Ranjit Singh, rebelled, and called to his aid Najaf Kh\u00e1n, who was nominally the commander-in-chief of the army of Delhi, but in reality an independent potentate. Najaf Kh\u00e1n obtained possession of Agra; but being called away into Rohilkhand, Nawal Singh took advantage of his absence to carry the war into the enemy\u2019s country. On Najaf Kh\u00e1n\u2019s return, accompanied by Ranjit Singh, the State and fortress of Bhartpur were taken; but all the territory was seized by Najaf Kh\u00e1n, except the fortress of Bhartpur, held by Ranjit Singh, and land valued at nine l\u00e1khs of rupees, which was restored to the latter on the intercession of his mother. On Najaf Kh\u00e1n\u2019s death, Sindhia seized all the country, including Bhartpur; but again Ranjit\u2019s mother interceded, and Sindhia restored to him 11 parg\u00e1n\u00e1s, to which 3 more were subsequently added for services rendered to General Perron. These fourteen parg\u00e1n\u00e1s now form the State of Bhartpur.\n\nRanjit Singh of Bhartpur was one of the first chieftains of northern Hindust\u00e1n to connect his interests with those of the British Govern-\nment. At the commencement of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 war, in 1803, a treaty was concluded with him by the British Government, as a consequence of which Lord Lake was joined by a Bhartpur contingent of horse, which did good service at the battle of Lasw\u00e1ri (Laswaree), and throughout the campaign against Sindh\u00eda. For these services, the British Government transferred to Bhartpur 5 districts, yielding 7 l\u00e1khs of rupees. But when war broke out with Holkar, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bhartpur first attempted evasion and then refused to send his contingent; and when the routed troops of Holkar were pursued to the glacis of Dig, a destructive artillery fire was opened from the ramparts on the British troops. Thereupon Lord Lake attacked Dig, and carried it by assault. Bhartpur was then invested on the 7th January 1805. The town was 8 miles in circumference, surrounded by a mud wall of great height and thickness, protected by numerous bastions, and a broad and deep moat filled with water. The garrison was estimated at 8000 men; and the artillery at hand for employment in breaching bore no proportion to the defensive strength of the works. Four successive assaults were repulsed; and finally the British army, with a loss of 388 killed and 1894 wounded, was compelled to withdraw. Though victorious, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 was evidently alarmed at the pertinacity of the assailants, and his success was followed by overtures for peace. Ranjit Singh surrendered the fort, and agreed to expel Holkar from his territories. By this treaty, the five districts conferred on him in 1803 were resumed, and he agreed to pay an indemnity of 20 l\u00e1khs of rupees (say \u00a3200,000), 7 l\u00e1khs of which were subsequently remitted.\n\nRanjit Singh of Bhartpur died in 1805, leaving four sons. The eldest, Randhir Singh, ruled for eighteen years; the second, Baldeo Singh, succeeded, but only ruled eighteen months. Balwant Singh was now the rightful heir; but his cousin, D\u00farjan S\u00e1l, grandson of Ranjit Singh, seized the fortress of Bhartpur and imprisoned the heir in 1826. An army of 25,000 men, well provided with artillery, led by Lord Combermere, marched against Bhartpur. Notwithstanding the large force of artillery, the strength and thickness of the walls offered such resistance to the breaching batteries that it became necessary to resort to mining. The mines were commenced on December 23rd, and sprung on the 17th January following, when a sufficient breach was effected, and the fortress carried by assault on the 18th. D\u00farjan S\u00e1l was made prisoner; Balwant Singh, then an infant, was placed in power, his mother acting as regent, and a political agent superintending affairs. In 1835, Balwant Singh was put in charge of the administration, and died in 1853, being succeeded by his only son the present Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1, Jaswant Singh, who was born in 1852. During his minority, the administration was carried on by a political agent and council of seven Sard\u00e1rs. The government\nwas made over to him with full powers, on his coming of age in 1869. The chief holds a sanad of adoption, and his State is in offensive and defensive alliance with the British Government. He is entitled to a salute of 17 guns.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The revenue of the State in 1882 was about \u00a3280,000. For judicial administration the State is divided into two parts, the northern division comprising the pargans of Dig, K\u00e1man, Gop\u00e1lgarh, Pah\u00e1ri, and N\u00e1ga, and the southern division the pargan\u00e1s Kumbher, Alihaig\u00e1rh, Bhus\u00e1war, Wer, Bi\u00e1na, Uchain, Rud\u00e1wal, and R\u00faph\u00e1s. No tribute is paid, nor any contributions to local contingents. A mint is kept up, at which both silver and copper are coined. There is a central school at the capital, where English, Persian, Sanskrit, and Arabic are taught. There are also 12 tahs\u00edli and 215 halkaband\u00ed (indigenous) schools, which teach the rudiments of Urdu and Hind\u00ed. The number of dispensaries is 13, besides a large hospital at the capital, all supervised by an Assistant Surgeon in the pay of the State. There is a central jail at Sewar, 3 miles from Bhartpur, and two smaller ones\u2014one in the fort of Bhartpur, the other in the fort of Dig. The R\u00e1jput\u00e1na State Railway line, connecting Agra with Jaipur (Jeypore), Ajmere, etc., is constructed on the metre gauge system, and passes through the middle of the State, from Ikran in the east to Kherli in the west, a distance of about 40 miles. The total armed strength of the State amounts to 10,210 men, of whom 1,460 are cavalry, 8,500 infantry and police, and 250 artillery. There are 38 cannon, unserviceable as field guns, but sufficient for purposes of ceremony. The total number of police of all kinds and denominations is about 3,850. The State is well provided with the means of communication, being traversed by two main roads from north to south and from east to west, the greater part of which are metalled; all the towns off these lines are connected with them by good country roads. No toll is levied. There was formerly a thriving trade in the manufacture of salt, which was produced in large quantities throughout the State. Since the conclusion of an agreement with the Government of India in 1879, the salt-works have been closed, and the salt-workers (kh\u00e1rw\u00e1ls) have found employment elsewhere.

Lat. 27\u00b0 13' 5\" N., long. 77\u00b0 32' 20\" E. Height above sea level, 577 feet; population (1881) 66,163, namely, males 36,580, and females 29,583. Hindus numbered 51,211; Muhammadans, 14,945; and 'others,' 7. The forts and ramparts, as they\nnow stand, were constructed in 1733 by Badan Singh. The town is named after Bharat, a legendary character of great fame in Hindu mythology, and is considered to be under the tutelary influence of Krishna, who is worshipped here under the name of Bih\u00e1ri. The fortress has played a prominent part in the history of the State; an account of the sieges by Lord Lake in 1805, and Lord Combermere in 1827, will be found in the article on Bhartpur State (vide supra). The town contains a large hospital, a school, a jail, a staging bungalow, and a post-office. The art of making a particular kind of chauri is entirely confined to a few families of the town in the employ of the Darb\u00e1r, and the process is kept a profound secret. The handles of these chauris are of sandal-wood, ivory, silver, etc., and handsomely ornamented. The secret is the process by which the tail is made; it is composed of long, straight, round fibres of either ivory or sandal-wood, which in good chauris are almost as fine as ordinary horse hair. A considerable fair is held here annually.\n\n**Bh\u00e1r\u00fadpura.**\u2014Petty State or guaranteed Th\u00e1kurate of the Deputy Bh\u00edl (Bheel) Agency, in Central India. The chief, who is a Bhumi\u00e1, holds 3 villages, for which he pays \u00a333 annually to the Dh\u00e1r State; besides the village of Kanr\u00edpura, in Mand\u00fa, which he holds in perpetuity, paying \u00a34 per annum. Revenue about \u00a3300. Population 71,724.\n\n**Bhasmangi.**\u2014Hill in Tumkur District, Mysore State. Crowned with fortifications, and containing on its summit a temple of Bhasmangesw\u00e1ra. It possesses a perennial supply of water. A few of the wild tribe of Bedars live half-way up, and cultivate the fields below. Lat. 13\u00b0 44' N., long. 77\u00b0 6' E.\n\n**Bhat\u00e1l\u00e1.**\u2014Village in Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 District, Central Provinces, situated 26 miles north-west of Bh\u00e1ndak town, and supposed to have formed part of the ancient Bhadr\u00e1vati. On a hill near the village are the remains of a fine ancient temple, in good preservation; the whole hill bears traces of having been fortified, while at the foot are several tanks. Close by is a quarry of excellent free-stone.\n\n**Bh\u00e1tg\u00e1on.**\u2014Zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1ri or estate in the Seon\u00e1r\u00e1yan tahs\u00edl, Bil\u00e1spur District, Central Provinces; lying south of the Mah\u00e1nadi. Lat. 21\u00b0 39' 30\" N., long 82\u00b0 51' E.; area, 62 square miles, of which about 17 are cultivated and about 19 cultivable; number of villages, 44; occupied houses, 2561; population (1881) 9892, namely, 4913 males and 4979 females; average density of population, 159 per square mile. The zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1r is a Bij\u00e1 by caste.\n\n**Bh\u00e1tg\u00e1on.**\u2014Village in Seon\u00e1r\u00e1yan tahs\u00edl, Bil\u00e1spur District, Central Provinces. Population (1881) 2157, namely, Hindus, 1968; Kab\u00edrpanth\u00eds, 110; Muhammadans, 62; aboriginal tribes, 17.\n\n**Bh\u00e1tg\u00e1on.**\u2014Town in Purniah District, Bengal. Population (1881)\n5723, namely, 2775 Hindus and 2034 Muhammadans; area of town site, 5060 acres.\n\n**Bh\u00e1tg\u00e1on.**\u2014Town in the Native State of Nep\u00e1l, and formerly the favourite residence of the Br\u00e1hmans of the country; the inhabitants are now chiefly Hinduized Newars. The population is estimated at 30,000. Approximate lat. 27\u00b0 37' N., long. 85\u00b0 22' E. It is well kept, and has some fine old buildings. The old Mall dynasty of Bh\u00e1tg\u00e1on, like those of P\u00e1tan and Khatmandu, in the same valley, succumbed before the Gurkh\u00e1 invaders in A.D. 1768-69. The town is garrisoned by four regiments of infantry, numbering about 2000 fighting men. It is connected with Khatmandu, the capital of Nep\u00e1l, by a bridged carriage road about 8 miles in length. There are no fortifications. Cooking utensils and other vessels of brass, copper, and bell metal are made here for home use and exportation to Tibet.\n\n**Bhath\u00e1n.**\u2014Petty State in Jh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1r District, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency; consisting of 1 village, and 2 independent tribute-payers. Estimated revenue \u00a3316, of which \u00a364 is paid as tribute to the British Government, and \u00a36 to the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1gahrh. Lat. 22\u00b0 41' N., long. 71\u00b0 54' E.\n\n**Bh\u00e1t\u00ed.**\u2014The name given by the Muhammadan historians to the coast-strip of the Sundarbans from Hijili to the Meghn\u00e1. Lat. 20\u00b0 30' to 22\u00b0 30' N., long. 88\u00b0 to 91\u00b0 14' E. The name means 'lowlands overflowed by the tide,' and is still applied to the Sundarban tracts of Khuln\u00e1 and B\u00e1karganj Districts, Bengal.\n\n**Bhatkal** (Sanskrit name Manipura).\u2014Town in the Hon\u00e1w\u00e1r Sub-division, North K\u00e1nara District, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 13\u00b0 59' N., long. 74\u00b0 34' 46\" E. Within a mile and a half of the mouth of a small stream that falls into the Arabian Sea, about 64 miles south-east of K\u00e1rw\u00e1r. Population (1881) 5618, namely, 3064 Muhammadans, 2515 Hindus, 25 Jains, and 14 Christians; area of town site, 556 acres. There are 2 small and 2 large mosques; and the Musalm\u00e1n population has the special name Naw\u00e1yat, said to mean 'newly arrived,' owing to their being Sunn\u00ed Persians, driven from the Persian Gulf by the persecution of their Shi\u00e1 brethren, in the eighth century. Many of these Naw\u00e1yats are wealthy traders, and visit different parts of the country for business purposes, leaving their families at Bhatkal. There is a post-office.\n\nFrom the 14th to the 16th century, under the names of Batticala (Jordanus, 1321), Battecal\u00e1 (Barbosa, 1510), and Baticala (De Barros), Bhatkal was a flourishing centre of trade, where merchants from Ormuz and Goa came to load sugar and rice. In 1505, the Portuguese established a factory at Batticala, but a few years later the capture of Goa (1511) deprived the place of its importance. Two attempts were made by the British to establish an agency at Bhatkal\u2014the first in 1638 by a country association, the second in 1668 by the regular company, but\nboth failed. According to Captain Hamilton (1690\u20131720), the remains of a large city and many Jain and Br\u00e1hman temples were still to be seen in the beginning of the 18th century.\n\n**Bh\u00e1tkuli.**\u2014Town in Amr\u00e1oti District, Ber\u00e1r; 10 miles from Amr\u00e1oti town. Population (1881) 2508.\n\n**Bhatnair (Bhatner).**\u2014Town and fort in Hanum\u00e1ngarh District, on the north of Bikaner (Bickaneer) State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, on the left bank of the Ghagar river, now dried up. Lat. 29\u00b0 34\u2032 55\u2033 N., long. 74\u00b0 20\u2032 45\u2033 E. Captain Powlett, in his *Gazetteer of the Bikaner State*, says: \u2018The Bhatnair fort has attained historical celebrity from its position on the direct route of invasion from Central Asia to India. I am informed by Mr. Oliver, late Deputy Commissioner of Sirsa, that Bhatnair, Abor, Bhatind\u00e1, and Sirsa, situated at the angles of a nearly square figure, with a side about 50 miles long, had each a fort on the same plan and of the same dimensions, and thus formed a \u201cquadrilateral\u201d in the path of any invader from the north-west.\u2019 The *T\u00e1rikh-i-Hind* speaks of Bhatnair having been taken by Mahm\u00fad of Ghazni in 1001; and Tod says that it was attacked by Tim\u00far. It seems probable that Tim\u00far left a Tartar Chagitai noble in charge, who was expelled by Bhatt\u00eds from M\u00e1rot and Phulra; but whether the place took its name originally from them, or from one R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bharat, is much disputed. General Cunningham states that Bhatnair was taken by Khetsi Kondh\u00e1lat in 1527 A.D. from Sada Ch\u00e1yal R\u00e1jput, of which clan no mention is made by Tod. In 1549, Mirz\u00e1 Kamr\u00e1n, brother of Hum\u00e1y\u00fan, took the fort by assault, on which occasion Khetsi, with 5000 R\u00e1jputs, was slain, although Kamr\u00e1n was subsequently defeated by R\u00e1o Jetsa of Bikaner (Bickaneer). Firoz Ch\u00e1yal had meanwhile recovered the fort, and the R\u00e1o therefore sent his son, Th\u00e1kur S\u00ed, to retake it. This was done by surprise and sudden assault. In Samvat 1816 or 1817, the fort was taken by Hassan Muhammad, a Bhatt\u00ed leader, but was again retaken. In Samvat 1861, it was beleaguered by a Bikaner (Bickaneer) force; and after a close investment, lasting more than five months, the place was taken. In 1800 A.D., it was attacked by the adventurer George Thomas, to whom it capitulated after the ramparts had been breached. He did not hold it long, however, and it eventually reverted to the State of Bikaner. Bhatnair, now called Hanum\u00e1ngarh, is about 150 miles from Bikaner. It is the head-quarters of the *tahsild\u00e1r* of the District, which comprises about 110 villages.\n\n**Bh\u00e1tpur.**\u2014Village in Hardoi District, Oudh; on the right bank of the G\u00famti, 20 miles east-north-east of Sandila, and 6 south of B\u00e1ri. Population (1881) 2308, chiefly of the B\u00e1is caste.\n\n**Bhatti\u00e1na.**\u2014Tract of country in the Punjab, now included in Sirsa District. It derives its name from the Bhatt\u00eds, a wild R\u00e1jput clan, who held the country lying between Hari\u00e1na, Bikaner, and Bah\u00e1walpur.\nSkirts the borders of the great sandy desert, and at present contains a small and scattered population. Numerous ruins of towns and villages show that the valley of the Ghagar, and the tract on either side of it, was once the home of a thriving people. But Tim\u00far, who passed through the District on his invasion of India, devastated the tract, and when it came into our hands it was almost uninhabited. It has since been settled by immigrants from the Sikh States and R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, and the population is fast increasing. The Ghagar flows in a valley of alluvial clay of some three to four miles in width, within which its waters are used for irrigation purposes. But the rude dams which it was the custom to construct have lately been removed on the complaint of the Bikaner State. The stream, which once joined the Sutlej (Satlaj) near Bah\u00e1walpur, now disappears in the desert of Bikaner.\n\nAt the close of the last century, the tract, then utterly deserted, fell into the hands of the Bhatt\u00eds, a band of nomads and robbers, who planted a few fortified villages in the midst of the waste, as places of refuge on the approach of danger. In 1795, George Thomas, the adventurer of Hari\u00e1na, extended his influence over the Bhatt\u00ed chiefs, who paid him at least a nominal allegiance. After the victories of Lord Lake in 1803, Bhatti\u00e1na passed with the rest of the Delhi territory under British rule; but no practical steps were taken to secure this outlying possession until 1810. A military force was then despatched against two Bhatt\u00ed chieftains, Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n and Zabta Kh\u00e1n, who had proclaimed their independence. Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n was overpowered and expelled the country; but Zabta Kh\u00e1n swore fealty to the British Government, and secured possession of his territory for the time. In 1818, however, he connived at certain attacks made against Fateh\u00e1b\u00e1d within British limits; and a second force was sent to expel him and confiscate his estates. After protracted boundary disputes with the Sikh States, a District of Bhatti\u00e1na was formed in 1837; and when it passed in 1858 to the Punjab Government, it was called Sirsa District, which name it now bears.\n\n**Bh\u00e1turi\u00e1.**\u2014Village in Bardw\u00e1n District, Bengal. Lat. 23\u00b0 26' N., long. 88\u00b0 20' E.\n\n**Bhaun.**\u2014Town in Chakw\u00e1l tahs\u00edl, Jhelum (Jehlam) District, Punjab. Population (1881) 5080, namely, Muhammadans, 3262; Hindus, 1604; and Sikhs, 214; number of occupied houses, 461.\n\n**Bhaunagar** (Bh\u00e1vanagar).\u2014Native State within the British Agency of K\u00e1thi\u00e1war, in the Province of Gujar\u00e1t (Guzerat), Bombay Presidency, lying between 20\u00b0 56' 30\" and 22\u00b0 16' 30\" N. lat., and between 71\u00b0 16' and 72\u00b0 20' 45\" E. long.; area, 2860 square miles; population in 1881, 400,323, distributed among 659 villages, and consisting of 346,094 Hindus, of the Vaishnav, Sm\u00e1rta, and Jain sects, 37,040 Muhammadans, and 17,189 'others.' Gross revenue,\nabout \u00a3230,000. Over about one-half the area, the soil is the regar or black cotton earth, the remainder is light and sandy. Water is obtained from wells and rivers. The climate on the sea-coast is good, but inland it is hot and dry. The most common disease is fever. Products, grain, salt, and cotton; manufactures, oil, copper and brass vessels, and cloth. The quantity of cotton produced is very considerable, and forms one of the chief sources of wealth of the State. The exports from its various ports in 1880-81 were returned at a total value of \u00a31,164,921; imports at \u00a31,196,254. The State does not levy transit dues. A road has been constructed from Bhaunagar to Vartej and Gogo, and another to Dhas\u00e1. About 60 miles of the K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r or Bhaunagar-Gondal Railway runs through the State.\n\nThe present Th\u00e1kur S\u00e1hib of Bhaunagar, named Takht Singhj\u00ed, was born about 1858. He is a Gohel R\u00e1jput, and was educated at the R\u00e1jkum\u00e1r College at R\u00e1jkot. During his minority, the administration was conducted by joint administrators\u2014one a British officer, the other the old Minister of the State.\n\nThe tribe of Gohel R\u00e1jputs are said to have settled in the country about the year 1260 A.D. under their chief Sejak, from whose three sons R\u00e1noj\u00ed, S\u00e1rangj\u00ed, and Sh\u00e1hj\u00ed, are descended respectively the chiefs of Bhaunagar, L\u00e1thi, and P\u00e1lit\u00e1na. The W\u00e1la State also is an offshoot from Bhaunagar. The town of Bhaunagar was founded in 1723 by Bhau Singh, grandfather of Wakhat Singh, who succeeded to the chieftaincy in 1772. Bhau Singh, his son R\u00e1wal Akherajji, and his grandson Wakhat Singh, took great pains to improve the trade of their country, and to destroy the pirates who infested the neighbouring seas. A very intimate connection was thus formed between Bhaunagar and the Bombay Government. In 1759, the British Government acquired a right to a fourth share of the customs of the port of Bhaunagar from the Sidi of Surat, to whom it had been granted by Bhau Singh, as the price of protection from the enmity of the Naw\u00e1b of Cambay. In 1771, R\u00e1wal Akherajji assisted the Bombay Government in reducing Tal\u00e1ja and Mahuwa, which were occupied by piratical Kul\u00eds. After the conquest of Tal\u00e1ja, the fort was offered to Akherajji by the Bombay Government, but he refused to accept it, and it was in consequence made over to the Naw\u00e1b of Cambay. Wakhat Singh, however, after his accession, dispossessed the Naw\u00e1b of the fort, which, under an engagement arranged by the British Government in 1773, he was allowed to retain on paying a sum of \u00a37500. The boundaries of the Bhaunagar State were largely increased by various other acquisitions made by Wakhat Singh previous to the settlement of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r.\n\nWhen Gujar\u00e1t (Guzerat) and K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r were divided between the Peshw\u00e1 and the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r, the western and larger portion of the Bhaunagar possessions were included in the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r\u2019s share; while the eastern and\nsmaller portion, including Bhaunagar itself and the original estates of the family in Sihor (Sehore), fell to the Peshw\u00e1, and formed part of the Districts of Dhandh\u00faka and Gogo, which the Peshw\u00e1 ceded to the British Government under the treaty of Bassein. At the time of the settlement of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, therefore, part of the Bhaunagar possessions had already become British territory, while part remained under the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r. The revenue (jam\u00e1) demanded from the British portion was \u00a31165, and that payable to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r was fixed at \u00a37450. But as it was expedient to consolidate in the hands of the British Government the various claims over Bhaunagar, an agreement was made, with the Th\u00e1kur\u2019s consent, for the transfer of the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r\u2019s tribute in Bhaunagar to the British Government, which was accordingly included in the cessions made in 1807 by the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r for the support of a contingent force. In 1839, the British Government suppressed the mint at Bhaunagar, where copper money had been previously coined. As compensation for this, a sum of \u00a3280 a year was granted to the Th\u00e1kur. A further sum of \u00a3400 was given to him, in consideration of his resigning all claims to share in the land or sea customs of Gogo. The Th\u00e1kur also subscribed the usual engagements, exempting from duty vessels putting into his port under stress of weather.\n\nAfter the cession of Dhandh\u00faka and Gogo, the chief of Bhaunagar was tacitly permitted to exercise the same powers as before in the portion of his estates which fell within these Districts. But in consequence of a serious abuse of power, his British estates were, in 1815, placed under the jurisdiction of the English courts. The Th\u00e1kur never ceased to complain of this change, and to bring forward claims. Eventually, after full investigation, an agreement was concluded by which the Th\u00e1kur\u2019s revenue in his British estates was fixed at \u00a35200 in perpetuity. In 1866, certain villages in this portion of the State were removed from the jurisdiction of the revenue, civil, and criminal courts of the Bombay Presidency, and transferred to the supervision of the Political Agent in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. In 1873, the Bhaunagar State made an agreement with the British Government for the construction of a telegraph line between Bhaunagar and Dholera.\n\nBhaunagar ranks as a first-class Tributary State among the many petty States in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r; its chief is entitled to a salute of 11 guns, and he maintains a military force of 2765 men, also 85 mounted and 500 foot police. He has powers of life and death over all except British subjects. A tribute is payable of \u00a315,449, 19s. jointly to the British Government (\u00a312,806), the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r, and the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1garh. The chief has received a sanad authorizing adoption, and the succession follows the rule of primogeniture. There are 117 schools, with 6238 pupils.\n\n**Bhaunagar (Bh\u00e1v\u00e1nag\u00e1r).**\u2014Town and port in the Gulf of Cambay, and chief town of the State of the same name, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay\nPresidency. Lat. $21^\\circ 45'$ N., long. $72^\\circ 12' 30''$ E.; population (1881) 47,792, namely, 34,978 Hindus, 8,434 Muhammadans, 5,714 Jains, 248 Christians, 95 Parsis, and 323 'others.' The town was founded in 1742 by Bhau Singh, and rapidly rose to influence under a line of princes who encouraged commerce and suppressed the piratical communities that infested the Gulf of Cambay. It has a good and safe harbour for shipping of light draught, and carries on an extensive trade, being the principal market and harbour of export for cotton in K\u00e1thi\u00e1war. It possesses a spinning and weaving mill, working 12,064 spindles in 1875, and several steam presses. The harbour is difficult of access, being approached by a winding creek. The export of cotton to Bombay in 1874-75 was valued at \u00a31,313,799. Dispensary and post-office.\n\n**Bhausingh.**\u2014Market village on the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed river, in Bardw\u00e1n District, Bengal. Lat. $23^\\circ 36' 24''$ N., long. $88^\\circ 13' 30''$ E.

It enters the low country in lat. $11^\\circ 9'$ N., long. $76^\\circ 37'$ E.; and after a winding course eastward, 105 miles in length, during which it receives several affluents, the Moy\u00e1r being the chief, it joins the K\u00e1veri (Cauvery) at the town of Bhav\u00e1n\u00ed. The chief places on its banks are Mettapolliem (Mettup\u00e1layam), where it is crossed by a good masonry bridge, Att\u00e1ni, Denaikankotia, Satyamangalam, and Bhav\u00e1n\u00ed, where it joins the K\u00e1veri (Cauvery). Fish abound in the stream, especially near Mettapolliem; the water is considered unwholesome. It feeds four irrigation works, of which three are important, viz. Arkankottai and T\u00e1dapalli, from the Kodivalli anicut near Satyamangalam, and the Kalingarayan, from the anicut near Bhav\u00e1n\u00ed. The gross revenue from the irrigated lands is \u00a324,700.\n\n**Bhav\u00e1n\u00ed.**\u2014T\u00e1luk in Coimbatore District, Madras Presidency. Area, 722 square miles, containing 1 town and 61 villages. Houses, 19,651; population (1881) 94,123, being males 46,230, and females 47,893. The t\u00e1luk is bounded on the north and east by the K\u00e1veri river; on the south by the Erode t\u00e1luk, and on the west by the Satyamangalam and Collegal t\u00e1luks. The north and west are hilly and covered with forest, the Burghur (Barg\u00far) hills marking the western boundary. Wild tribes, of whom little is known, are found on the hills. The t\u00e1luk, especially near the forests, is unhealthy. Irrigation is carried on to a small extent, chiefly by the Appag\u00fadal series of tanks, irrigating 1,428 acres, of which 1292 are assessed at \u00a3814. Area about 536 square miles, of which 135,327 acres are occupied. Land revenue, \u00a311,858. Number of villages, 66. Above 80 per cent. of the soil is red sand, and the average dry assessment per acre is 1s. 10d. The\nchief roads are the Satyamangalam road, which nearly follows the course of the Bhav\u00e1ni river, and two roads leading to Mysore by Barg\u00far and Nadukaval respectively. Products are ordinary grains, iron in small quantity, good and well-dyed cottons, carpets, gunny, and forest produce. There are few schools, and those of the primary class; 4 large and 4 small markets where fees are collected, 28 ferries, and 6 police stations. Trade is unimportant, except in grain and forest produce. There are 36 arrack and 37 toddy shops in the t\u00e1luk. Near Nerinjipetta there is a large anicut across the K\u00e1veri (Cauvery), at present out of repair and useless; it is doubtful whether its repair would be profitable.\n\n**Bhav\u00e1ni** (*Bhav\u00e1ni K\u00fad\u00e1l*). \u2014 Town in the Bhav\u00e1ni t\u00e1luk, Coimbatore District, Madras Presidency; formerly feudatory to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Madura. Lat. 11\u00b0 26' N., long. 77\u00b0 44' E.; population (1881) 5930, almost exclusively Hindus (5672), 20 per cent. being Br\u00e1hmans; houses, 1387. Situated at the junction of the Bhav\u00e1ni and K\u00e1veri (Cauvery) rivers, 9 miles north of Erode railway station. Once the chief town of the District, now only a post town and head-quarters of the tahs\u00edl; has also a sub-registrar. Both the K\u00e1veri (Cauvery) and Bhav\u00e1ni are here crossed by fine masonry bridges, over which the high road from Madras to Coimbatore passes, and the town shares in the traffic on seven roads which converge here. These are the main roads to Salem, Coimbatore, and Satyamangalam; the Hassan\u00far gh\u00e1t, and Barg\u00far gh\u00e1t roads, and the roads to Erode and Kondap\u00e1di. In November, many pilgrims assemble at the temple of Sangamma Isvara, built at the confluence (*sangamma*) of the rivers. The bridge over the K\u00e1veri (Cauvery) was completed in 1847, and immediately afterwards destroyed by the freshets. It was rebuilt with 26 spans, at a cost of \u00a34900, and again opened for traffic in 1851. Good cotton carpets and cloths are made here and dyed.\n\n**Bhaw.** \u2014 River in Pegu District, Pegu Division, British Burma. \u2014 See BHAW.\n\n**Bh\u00e1w\u00e1l** (or *N\u00e1gari*). \u2014 Village in Dacca District, Bengal. Lat. 23\u00b0 59' 35\" N., long. 90\u00b0 27' 50\" E. In 1839, this and several neighbouring villages were the property of a Roman Catholic Mission, and Bh\u00e1w\u00e1l contained in that year about 500 houses, almost entirely inhabited by Christians of Portuguese descent.\n\n**Bh\u00e1wan.** \u2014 Town in R\u00e1i Bareli tahs\u00edl, R\u00e1i Bareli District, Oudh; 8 miles south-east of R\u00e1i Bareli town. Lat. 26\u00b0 26' N., long. 81\u00b0 18' E. Founded by a Bhar chief of the same name about 500 years ago. On the overthrow of the Bhar power, the town was made over to a Muhammadan chief, and a fort built, the remains of which now consist of unshapely mounds. Masonry mosque.\n\n**Bhaw\u00e1nandpur.** \u2014 Village in S\u00e1lb\u00e1ri *pargan\u00e1* (fiscal division),\nDin\u00e1jpur District, Bengal; 6 miles north of R\u00e1n\u00edsank\u00e1il police station, and 1 mile west of the river Kulik. Scene of the celebrated Nekmard fair held in honour of a p\u00edr, or Muhammadan saint, buried here. His tomb, in a mat hut in the middle of a mango grove, is visited during the six or seven days of the fair by about 150,000 persons from all parts of the country. The fair is opened on the first day of the Bengali year, corresponding to the 10th or 11th April. A great variety of articles are brought for sale. Oxen come from Purniah and the surrounding Districts, ponies from the Bh\u00fat\u00e1n Hills, horses from K\u00e1b\u00fal and the Behar Districts, elephants from the D\u00e1rjiling tar\u00e1i and Assam, and camels from the north-west. Mughals and Afgh\u00e1ns bring dried fruits, embroidered saddlery, looking-glasses, etc. The hill tribes bring down blankets, woollen cloths, ponies, and y\u00fak tails. The Nep\u00e1l\u00eds sell kukris (heavy bill-hooks, the national weapon of the Gurkh\u00e1s) and chiret\u00e1 leaf. Quantities of real and imitation coral beads are exposed for sale by the M\u00e1rv\u00e1ri shopkeepers of Din\u00e1jpur. Besides the above, there are English piece-goods, brass pots of all sorts and sizes, hookahs, grain, etc.\n\n**Bhaw\u00e1n\u00ed.**\u2014Tahsil and town in Hiss\u00e1r District, Punjab.\u2014See Bhiwani.\n\n**Bhaw\u00e1n\u00edpatn\u00e1.**\u2014Village in K\u00e1l\u00e1hand\u00ed Feudatory State, attached to Sambalpur District of the Central Provinces.

The native village is on Tolly's Canal. Some trade in firewood is carried on.\n\n**Bh\u00e1y\u00e1wadar.**\u2014Town in H\u00e1l\u00e1r District, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 21\u00b0 51' 15\" N., long. 70\u00b0 17' 15\" E.; population (1881) 5197, namely, 4428 Hindus, 669 Muhammadans, and 100 Jains.\n\n**Bhedan** (or Basaikel\u00ed).\u2014Ancient Gond chiefship, now attached to Sambalpur District, Central Provinces; 24 miles south-south-west of Sambalpur town. Lat. 21\u00b0 12' N., long. 83\u00b0 47' 30\" E. The population, residing in 30 villages, spread over an area of 60 square miles, consists of Br\u00e1hmans, Ladras, Kult\u00e1s, Gonds, and Dhim\u00e1ls. The estate is highly cultivated, the chief product being rice. Pulses and oil-seeds are also grown to a small extent, while sugar-cane cultivation is spreading. The revenue of the estate amounts to about \u00a3327 a year, and an annual tribute is payable to Government of \u00a3104. The chiefship is said to have been conferred on Sisa R\u00e1i Gond, the founder of the family, by Balr\u00e1m Deo, the first Chauh\u00e1n ruler of Sambalpur, about 300 years ago. Manohar Singh, the chief in 1857, joined the rebels under Surendra S\u00e1, and being killed in action, was succeeded by his son Baijn\u00e1th Singh, a minor. Owing to the embarrassed circumstances of the family, the estate came under Government management in 1878. The\nsum of \u00a3150 is yearly spent in the administration of the estate, and for the support of the Chief and his family, the balance of the realizations being devoted to the reduction of debt. The chief village, Bhedan (pop. 1781), has an excellent school, with an average of 45 pupils.\n\n**Bheel 'Agency.'**\u2014A collection of Native States in Central India. \u2014See **Bhilwara**.\n\n**Bheeleng.**\u2014River and town in Shwe-gyin District, British Burma. \u2014See **Bilin**.\n\n**Bheeleng-Kyaik-hto.**\u2014Township in Shwe-gyin District, British Burma. \u2014See **Bilin-Kyaik-to**.\n\n**Bheeloo-Gywon.**\u2014Island at the mouth of the Salwin river, Amherst District, British Burma. \u2014See **Bilu-Gywon**.\n\n**Bhel\u00e1ni.**\u2014Town in the Nausharo Sub-division, Haidarabad (Hyderabad) District, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Population (1881) 1459, namely, 700 Muhammadans, chiefly Sah\u00e1tas; and 750 Hindus, principally Lohan\u00f3s. Distant 18 miles north-east of Th\u00e1rush\u00e1h. Founded prior to the 16th century. It adjoins the town of **Halani**.\n\n**Bhenglaing.**\u2014River in Amherst District, Arakan Division, British Burma. \u2014See **Binlaing**.\n\n**Bhensdehi.**\u2014Village in Betul tahsil, Betul District, Central Provinces. Population (1881) 2653, namely, Hindus, 2373; Muhammadans, 192; Jains, 80; aboriginal tribes, 8.\n\n**Bhera.**\u2014Tahsil in Sh\u00e1hpur District, Punjab; lying between 31\u00b0 54' 50\" and 32\u00b0 35' 45\" N. lat., and between 72\u00b0 45' 45\" and 73\u00b0 25' 15\" E. long. Area, 1181 square miles; population (1881) 167,260, namely, males 89,809, and females 77,451; persons per square mile, 142. Hindus numbered 24,752; Muhammadans, 114,282; Sikhs, 1215; 'others,' 27,011. Revenue of the tahsil, \u00a314,291. The administrative staff consists of 1 tahsild\u00e1r and 1 munsif, who preside over 1 civil and 2 criminal courts. Number of police stations (th\u00fan\u00e1s), 9; strength of regular police, 138 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 173. Near the village of Vijjh\u00ed, in Bhera tahsil, is found one of the most conspicuous of the mounds abounding everywhere throughout Sh\u00e1hpur District, which tell of a bygone age of great prosperity, and attest the truth of the Greek accounts of hundreds of large cities in the upper Punjab, and a country teeming with population.\n\n**Bhera.**\u2014Town and municipality in Sh\u00e1hpur District, Punjab, and head-quarters of Sh\u00e1hpur tahsil. Lat. 32\u00b0 29' N., long. 72\u00b0 57' E. Population (1881) 15,165, namely, 9153 Muhammadans, 5746 Hindus, 260 Sikhs, and 6 Jains. A third-class municipality, with an income in 1880-81 of \u00a31151; expenditure, \u00a31258. It lies on the left bank of the river Jhelum (Jehlam), and is the largest and most thriving commercial town in the District. The original city lay on\nthe left bank, and possessed considerable importance, as it purchased safety during B\u00e1bar's invasion by a present of 2 l\u0101khs of rupees (\u00a320,000), but was afterwards destroyed by hill tribes. The remaining ruins, known as Jobn\u00e1thnagar, are identified by General Cunningham with the capital of Sopheites, contemporary of Alexander the Great. The new town was founded about 1540, round a fine mosque and tomb of a Muhammadan saint. The mosque has lately been restored. Centre of a mah\u00e1l under Akbar; plundered and laid waste by Ahmad Sh\u00e1h's general, Nur-ud-d\u00edn, in 1757; re-populated by the Sikh chieftains of the Bhangi confederacy; greatly improved under British rule. T\u0101hs\u012bl and police station, school, dispensary, town-hall. Large trade in cotton during the American war, since somewhat declined. Exports of ghi and country cloth; flourishing manufacture of cotton cloth, ponkhas, soap, coarse felt, iron goods, wood-carving, brass-work, knife handles, and glove-boxes mounted in jade, swords and cutlery generally, and country felt rugs (namdas); imports of rice, sugar, g\u00far, European piece-goods, Bokh\u00e1r\u00e1 silk, ermine furs, Russian china ware, coins, and silver and gold ornaments.\n\n**Bheragh\u00e1t.**\u2014Village in Jabalpur (Jubbulpore) District, Central Provinces, on the banks of the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda); remarkable for the scenery in its neighbourhood. The river winds in a crystal stream between perpendicular rocks of magnesian limestone, popularly known as the 'Marble Rocks,' 120 feet high, which appear to meet overhead, and in one part approach so closely that the natives call the pass the 'monkey's leap.' By moonlight, the views are specially fine, and the place is much visited by travellers. Indra is said to have made this channel for the waters of the pent-up stream, and the footprints left upon the rock by the elephant of the god still receive adoration. On one of the conical hills in the neighbourhood stands a Hindu temple, commanding a magnificent prospect. Woods cover the hill except on one side, where steps lined with masonry lead to the shrine, which is surrounded by a circular cloister ornamented with sculptures of many of the Hindu gods, particularly of Siva. The Muhammadans have injured many of the images. According to tradition, the iconoclasts were a portion of Aurangzeb's army encamped near Sangr\u00e1mpur. Some rude excavations in the neighbourhood once afforded a habitation to ascetics. A fair for religious purposes is held every November. Bheragh\u00e1t and the 'Marble Rocks' are situated about 12 miles south-west of Jabalpur town, and 3 miles from the railway station of M\u00edrganj on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. There are two d\u00e1k bungalows (rest-houses).\n\n**Bheren.**\u2014Estate or zamind\u00e1ri in Bargarh t\u0101hs\u012bl, Sambalpur District, Central Provinces.

Annual fair in honour of the goddess Anand\u00e1 Dev\u00ed, the tutelary deity of the place, attended by about 5000 persons. Government school.\n\nBhi\u00e1n.\u2014Village in the Sehw\u00e1n Sub-division of Kar\u00e1chi (Kurrachee) District, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Distant 23 miles north of Kotri. Police station and staging bungalow. No particular trade or manufactures.\n\nBhidanw\u00e1la.\u2014Village in Sirhind, Punjab. Lat. 31\u00b0 10' N., long. 75\u00b0 E. Situated on the bank of a large offset of the Sutlej (Satlaj), issuing from that river a short distance below its junction with the Beas (Bi\u00e1s).\n\nBhikor\u00e1\u00ed.\u2014Village in Jodhpur State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Lat. 26\u00b0 30' N., long. 71\u00b0 50' E. On the route from Pokharan to Balmer, 32 miles south of the former. About 100 houses; population chiefly Chauh\u00e1n R\u00e1jputs.\n\nBhil Tribes, The.\u2014A pre-Aryan race inhabiting the Vindhy\u00e1, S\u00e1tpur\u00e1, and S\u00e1tm\u00e1l\u00e1 or Ajanta Hills. The Bhils were apparently the chief of the large group of tribes that at one time held most of the country now distributed among the Provinces of Mew\u00e1r, M\u00e1lwa, Kh\u00e1ndesh, and Gujar\u00e1t. Colonel Tod states that the earliest people of Mew\u00e1r were Bhils, and Hamilton mentions that the Bhils were specially strong in the south of M\u00e1lwa. Ousted by later invaders from the richest of their old possessions, the Bhils still hold (to the number of three-quarters of a million) the wilder and outlying of the tracts named above, in the Vindhy\u00e1, S\u00e1tpur\u00e1, and S\u00e1tm\u00e1l\u00e1 or Ajanta Hills. They do not pass east into the Gond country, nor south into the Konkan. Bishop Caldwell is of opinion that the Bhils belong to the family of pre-Aryan races, who, like the Kols and Sant\u00e1ls, entered India from the north-east. The popular legend of the origin of the Bhils is that they are descended from Mah\u00e1deo, who had intercourse with a female he met in the woods, and by her had many children. One of them, ugly and vicious, killed his father's bull, and was banished to the mountains and forests. His descendants have since that time been called Bhils or outcastes. The name Bhil is, however, believed to be derived from the Dravidian 'Bill\u00fa,' a bow.\n\nIn many States of R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, M\u00e1lwa, and Gujar\u00e1t, when a R\u00e1jput chief succeeds, his brow is marked by blood taken from the thumb or the toe of a Bhil. The R\u00e1jputs say that this blood-mark is a sign of Bhil allegiance, but it seems to be a relic of Bhil power. The Bhils are very persistent in keeping alive this practice. The\nright of giving the blood is claimed by certain families, and the belief that the man from whose veins it flows dies within a year fails to damp their zeal for this usage. The R\u00e1jputs, on the other hand, would gladly let the practice die, as they say that they shrink from the application of this impure Bhil blood. The true ground of their dislike to the ceremony is probably due to the quasi-acknowledgment which it conveys of their need of investiture by an older and conquered race.\n\nThe Bh\u00edls, although grouped in distinct classes, are one people. The Mughals (1600) found them hard-working and loyal subjects, and under the Delhi emperors they seem to have continued quiet and orderly. But during the 18th century, in the disturbances that marked the transfer of power from the Mughals to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, they asserted their independence; and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, failing to bring them to order, treated them as outlaws, and permitted their lowest officers to take their lives without trial. A Bh\u00edl caught in a disturbed part of the country was, without inquiry, flogged and hanged. Torture was freely used. Exposed to the sun, with his nose slit and his ears shaved from his head, the Bh\u00edl was burnt to death chained to a red-hot iron seat. Hundreds were thrown over a high cliff near Ant\u00far, and large bodies of them, assembled under a promise of pardon, were beheaded or blown from guns. Their women were mutilated or smothered by smoke, and their children dashed to death against the stones. Cruelties like these drove the Bh\u00edls to desperation. They took refuge in the rocky fastnesses of the Western Vindhy\u00e1s and the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s, or along the forest-covered banks of the Mahi, the Narbad\u00e1, and the T\u00e1pti. In these tracts, protected by the nature of the country, they have since dwelt.\n\nThe Bh\u00edls, roving and restless by disposition, and skilful hunters by necessity, long defied their oppressors. Superstitious in the extreme, and possessing little attachment to fixed spots, their hive-like habitations on the isolated knolls were abandoned without regret on the occurrence of any evil omen. Addicted to bouts of drinking, they burst forth in frenzied bands on the more settled country, and were a scourge to the lowlands. Ten thousand of the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r\u2019s troops, sent for the purpose of their coercion, were defeated and driven with disgrace from their fastnesses. After an unsuccessful attempt on the part of the British in 1818 to bring them to order by force, kinder measures were resorted to. A large body of the Bh\u00edls were thus reclaimed. They took service under our officers, and formed a Bh\u00edl corps which in 1827 numbered 600 men. This corps stormed the fastnesses of the unreformed sections of the race, seized their leaders, and reduced the whole of the clans to habits of order. By the personal influence of some of their early officers, Robertson, Ovans, and Outram,\nmany Bhils settled down, as members of the police or as husbandmen, into regular industry. At the same time, though peace was established, and has since on the whole prevailed, any local disturbance has sufficed to re-awaken in some of the Bhil tribes their old love of plunder.\n\nThe Bhil has made little advance in the standards of civilization or comfort. Ignorance, carelessness, and love of liquor have, especially in Western Kh\u00e1ndesh, sunk many of the race deep in debt to the astute Hindus. The machinery of the law courts is worked by the Hindu usurer to keep his Bhil debtors in his power; and notwithstanding the great rise in the value of their labour, many of the Bhils toil on in practical bondage to their creditors. They are fed between seed-time and harvest, and they receive an occasional turban or cotton cloth. In other respects they are not much better off than in the old times of oppression. Even as small landholders, their carelessness and want of skill prevent their rise in the social scale. As labourers, although physically strong and efficient workers when they please, their idleness and fitfulness stand in the way of their earning high wages.\n\nHow far the modern Bh\u00edl has changed from the original Bh\u00edl it is hard to say. The lowland Bh\u00edls, and when well fed many hill Bhils also, become equal in size and appearance to the low-class Hindus. In Poona they are superior in stature, appearance, and intelligence to the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s. This seems to show that the stunted, stupid, and savage Bhils of Kh\u00e1ndesh, Gujar\u00e1t, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, and Central India have, either from marriage with older and lower races, or from exposure and want of food, suffered both in mind and body. The wild woodsman of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s is dark, short, but well made, active and hardy, with high cheekbones, wide nostrils, and in some cases coarse, almost African features. Among the southern and western tribes, who probably more nearly represent the original type of Bh\u00edl, are many well-built and not a few tall, handsome men, with regular features and wavy hair. The lowland Bhils are now scarcely to be distinguished from the local low-class Hindus.\n\nThe Bhils of the present day may conveniently be arranged under three groups, namely\u2014(1) those of the plains, (2) those of the hills and forests, and (3) the mixed tribes. The first are found in small numbers in almost all the villages of Central and South Kh\u00e1ndesh. The second have their settlements in the Vindhy\u00e1s, the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s, the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds, the Bard\u00e1s, and the Dangs. The mixed tribes are\u2014(1) the Bhil\u00e1l\u00e1s (half Bh\u00edl and half R\u00e1jput or Kumbi), found in the Eastern S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s; (2) the Tadvis, and (3) the Nirdh\u00eds, both found in the S\u00e1tm\u00e1l\u00e1s and Eastern S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s. The two last-named sections of the race are half Bh\u00edl and half Musalm\u00e1n. The hill Bhils have seldom any clothing except a strip of cotton round their loins. Their women\nwear a coarse tattered robe. When they cannot get grain, they feed on wild roots and fruits, on several kinds of vermin, on animals that have died a natural death, and probably in remote places on the flesh of the cow. The lowland Bhils wear a turban, a coat, and waistcloth; their women a robe with or without a bodice. Both the men and women wear brass or silver ear-rings and anklets. They are in many respects Hinduized, and now constitute a low caste of the Hindu community. They give caste dinners at births, betrothals, marriages, and deaths, and are particular as to what they eat. The opening of the R\u00e1jkumar College at Indore now affords a new chance to the young Bhil chiefs, several of whom show fair promise.\n\nLieutenant Mildmay remarks: 'In villages inhabited by cultivators, there are seldom more than two or three families of Bhils who have originally owed their settlement to a small grant of land given to one of their number entertained as a m\u00e1nk\u00e1r or tracer of thieves, whose duty, in consideration of his holding this land rent-free, and of levying a small due on the crops of cultivators, is both to track robbers from his own village, and to take up any such track brought by the m\u00e1nk\u00e1r of any neighbouring village, and either to produce the robber or carry the trace beyond his own boundary, in default of which he or the Bh\u00famia who may be responsible for the village is held answerable for the stolen property.\n\n'There are some oaths and ceremonies which no Bhil will venture to break. One is swearing by the dog; the Bhil, placing his hand on the head of the dog, prays that if what he says be not true, the curse of the dog may fall upon him. Another oath is sworn by taking a small quantity of jo\u00e1r into the hand and holding it up, praying that the grain he eats may bring curses and destruction on him, should he speak aught but truth. A third oath is sworn by placing the hand on the head of his son. In many instances when these oaths are made use of, written agreements are given by which the person swearing agrees that, should any serious or extraordinary injury happen to himself or his family within a certain time, he will consent to be held guilty, or to have stated a falsehood.\n\n'They believe strongly in witchcraft, and also in the power of the Burw\u00e1s or witchfinders to point out who may be the witch who has inflicted any injury on them. Should any of their relations die without apparent cause, they consult the Burw\u00e1d, who, generally a shrewd, clever fellow, manages to find out beforehand what ugly, disagreeable old woman may live in the enquirer's village, and then he proceeds, apparently oracularly, to describe this old witch. Witches with the Bhils are tried much in the same way that they were in civilized England two centuries ago. They place the woman in one side of a bullock's pack sack, and three dry cakes of cow-dung in the other, and\nthrow her into the water, when, if she sink, she is no witch, but if she swim she is. Another mode is by rubbing red pepper in the eyes, which in a witch has no power to produce tears.\n\n'Their method of settling disputes is by the ceremony of Chik Phirna, or the assemblage of all the Bhils of the two villages to which the disputants belong. The matter is then discussed; and when they are agreed as to the sentence to be passed, one party pours a quantity of spirits into the hand of his opponent, who, after praying that if he ever quarrels again on the point now settled, the curse of the deity M\u00e1t\u00e1 or small-pox may fall upon him, drinks it off; the other party then goes through the same ceremony.'\n\nThe Bh\u00edl\u00e1l\u00e1 is a cross between a Bh\u00edl and R\u00e1jput. Of this class are all the Bhil chiefs of the Vindhy\u00e1 range. They do not intermarry with Bhils, but only in their own caste. Their marriage ceremonies comprise the agreement, the betrothal, and the wedding. The ceremony of agreement consists of an interchange of visits by members of the bride's and bridegroom's family, during which the necessary liquor for the discussion of the preliminaries is drunk. The betrothal and wedding are performed by the bride and bridegroom being painted over with turmeric ten days before the wedding, both parties eating together, and the bridegroom being conveyed on horseback to the bride's house, where a mandap or kind of shed is put up, which he first enters. The bride is then brought out to him, and they both march seven times round a burnt-offering of oil-seed and barley, their clothes being tied together. The night is spent in drinking and dancing, and in the morning the bridegroom takes the bride to his own house. The dowry given by the bridegroom is Rs. 16\u00bd, or 33s., while the bride contributes her jewels. The Bh\u00edl\u00e1l\u00e1 women do not make second marriages, although the Bh\u00edl women may. If the husband die, his brother alone may take the widow, and all the property and children. But the brother-in-law sometimes gives her away, without consulting her wishes, to another man for a bride; an irregularity which proves a fruitful source of quarrel. Should a widow have no offspring, her husband's property is divided among his relations.\n\nBhil marriages differ somewhat from those of Bh\u00edl\u00e1l\u00e1s, and are less formal. With them marriages take place at the age of 12 years, and there is no betrothal. The Bhils are very suspicious of their wives. Bhil women who leave their husbands subject the man with whom they run away to a fine of twelve cattle in the case of a first marriage; six in the case of a second. In the case of running away with a virgin, the fine is only three. The Bhils bury boys and virgins and those who have died of small-pox. All others are burnt; the funeral ceremonies being performed by the Gosain R\u00e1wals, who are generally presented with a bullock for their part in the work.\nThe Bhils, according to the Census of 1881, number in the\n\n|                  | Males   | Females | Total   |\n|------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Bombay Presidency| 172,295 | 169,339 | 341,634 |\n| R\u00e1jput\u00e1na        |         |         | 166,343 |\n| Central India    | 111,256 | 105,766 | 217,022 |\n| **Total**        |         |         | **724,999** |\n\n\u2014See also Bhilwara, Dangs, etc.\n\n**Bhil\u00e1uri (Bhil\u00e1udi).**\u2014Town in the T\u00e1sg\u00e1on Sub-division, Sat\u00e1ra District, Bombay Presidency; prettily situated on the left bank of the river Kistna (Krishna), facing the village of Akalkhop, 9 miles west of T\u00e1sg\u00e1on.

Rises in lat. 30\u00b0 46' N., long. 78\u00b0 55' E., in Garhw\u00e1l, North-Western Provinces, and flowing south-west for 50 miles, joins the Bh\u00e1g\u00edrath\u00ed in lat. 30\u00b0 23' N., long. 78\u00b0 31' E. It is considered sacred by the Hindus, and abounds with fish called, by Moorcroft, \u2018trout.\u2019\n\n**Bhilolpur (Bahlolpur).**\u2014Town in Ludhi\u00e1na District, Punjab. Lat 30\u00b0 54' N., long. 76\u00b0 21' E.; population (1881) 2842. Only noticeable as being one of the oldest towns in the District. Municipal income in 1880\u201381, \u00a3136; expenditure, \u00a3116.\n\n**Bhiloria.**\u2014Petty State in Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha, Bombay Presidency. Area, 9 square miles, with 11 villages; estimated revenue \u00a31200, of which \u00a3242 is paid as tribute to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r. The chief holds the title of Th\u00e1kur. The land is much broken up by ravines; but the soil is mostly a rich black loam, yielding the better class of crops, cotton, millet, oil-seeds, sugar-cane, and rice.\n\n**Bhilsa.**\u2014Revenue District and fortified town in Gwalior State, Central India. The town is situated 26 miles north-east of Bhop\u00e1l, on the right or eastern bank of the river Betw\u00e1, in lat. 23\u00b0 31' 35\" N., and long. 77\u00b0 50' 39\" E., and is perched on a rock 1546 feet above sea-level, and has a fort enclosed by a castellated stone wall, and surrounded by a ditch; the suburb outside has some spacious streets containing good houses. Population (1881) 7070, namely, Hindus, 5981; Muhammadans, 1077; and \u2018others,\u2019 12. In the fort lies an old gun, 19\u00bd feet in length, with a bore of 10 inches, said to have been made\nby order of the Emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr. It is described as being of 'elegant proportions and highly ornamented; made of the finest brass, and cast with the appearance of a network over it, with large rings held by dolphins.' After changing hands several times, Bhilsa was finally, in 1570, incorporated with the Empire of Delhi by Akbar. The tobacco produced in the vicinity of the town is considered the finest in India. The very best sort, however, is produced in a space not exceeding three acres, and the goodness of the tobacco in this single spot is no doubt owing to the very careful and high cultivation applied. The District produces excellent wheat, and is about to be opened up by the construction of a railway from Bhop\u00e1l to L\u00e1litpur. Bhilsa is now chiefly noteworthy as a famous place of Hindu pilgrimage to the temples, picturesquely situated in the bed of the Betw\u00e1 river, and as giving its name to the remarkable and interesting series of Buddhist topes found in its neighbourhood. Mr. Fergusson describes this series as 'the most extensive, and, taking it altogether, perhaps the most interesting, group of topes in India,' and devotes half of his work on *Tree and Serpent Worship*, and 45 plates, besides woodcuts, to the illustration of the great tope at Sanchi, about 5\u00bd miles distant. He thus describes (*History of Indian and Eastern Architecture*, pp. 61 sqq.) the entire group:\n\n'There [near Bhilsa], within a district not exceeding ten miles east and west and six north and south, are five or six groups of topes, containing altogether between 25 and 30 individual examples. The principal of these, known as the Great Tope at S\u00e1nchi, in the Bhop\u00e1l State, has been frequently described; the smaller ones are known from General Cunningham's descriptions only (*Bhilsa Topes, or Buddhist Monuments in Central India*); but altogether they have excited so much attention that they are perhaps better known than any group in India. We are not, however, perhaps justified in assuming, from the greater extent of this group as now existing, that it possessed the same pre-eminence in Buddhist times. If we could now see the topes that once adorned any of the great Buddhist sites in the Do\u00e1b or in Beh\u00e1r, the Bhilsa group might sink into insignificance. It may only be that, situated in a remote and thinly-peopled part of India, they have not been exposed to the destructive energy of opposing sects of the Hindu religion, and the bigoted Moslem has not wanted their materials for the erection of his mosques. They consequently remain to us, while it may be that nobler and more extensive groups of monuments have been swept from the face of the earth.' Little that is certain seems to be known regarding the object and history of the topes; but an examination of the largest of them at Sanchi shows that it is a stupa and not a daghoba\u2014that is to say, a monument raised to mark some sacred spot, or to commemorate some event, and not a shrine contain-\ning a relic. There is no reason to suppose that any stupas were raised before Asoka\u2019s time (B.C. 250), so that the earliest possible date of the S\u00e1nchi tope is fixed with some precision. Two of the smaller topes on the same platform (known as Nos. 2 and 3) contain relics of undoubted historical character, for a description of which the reader is referred to Mr. Fergusson\u2019s valuable work (loc. cit.). Much injury has been done to these relics by the reckless explorations of archaeologists, but their restoration has been carefully undertaken, and carried out in a great measure.\n\n\u2018Besides the group at S\u00e1nchi,\u2019 continued Mr. Fergusson, \u2018which comprises six or seven topes, there is at Son\u00e1ri, 6 miles distant, another group of eight topes. Two of these are important structures, enclosed in square courtyards; and one of them has yielded numerous relics to the explorer. At S\u00e1tdh\u00e1ra, 3 miles farther on, is a great tope 101 feet in diameter, which, like that at S\u00e1nchi, seems to have been a stupa and has yielded no relics. No. 2, however, though only 24 feet in diameter, was found to contain relics of Sariputra and Moggal\u00e1na, like No. 3 at S\u00e1nchi. Besides these there are several others, all small and very much ruined. The most numerous group, however, is situated at Bhojpur, 7 miles from S\u00e1nchi, where 37 distinct topes are grouped together on various platforms. The largest is 66 feet in diameter; but No. 2 is described as one of the most perfect in the neighbourhood, and, like several others in this group, one which contained important relics. At Andhar, about 5 miles west of Bhojpur, is a fine group of three small but very interesting topes. With those above enumerated, this makes up about sixty distinct and separate topes in this small district, which certainly was not one of the most important in India in a religious point of view, and consequently was probably surpassed by many, not only in the number but in the splendour of their religious edifices.\u2019\n\nMr. Fergusson assigns the topes to the three centuries and a half between 250 B.C. and the first century of our era.\n\n**Bhil\u00fa-Gywon.**\u2014Island at the mouth of the Salw\u00edn river, British Burma.\u2014See Bilu-Gywon.\n\n**Bhilw\u00e1ra (Bheelwara).**\u2014A tract of country in Central India occupied by a collection of Native States (known as the Bhil or Bhop\u00e1war Agency), under the political superintendence of the Governor-General\u2019s Agent for Central India. Surrounded on all sides by Native States of Central India, principally those of Holkar and Sindhia, Bhilw\u00e1ra consists chiefly of the wild hilly tracts of the Vindhy\u00e1 range north of the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) river, inhabited principally by Bh\u00edls. It includes the following 17 States, together with certain outlying portions of Indore and Gwalior: \u2014 Dhar, Bakhtgarh, Jhabua, Ali-Rajpur, Jobat, Katiwara, Ratanmal, Mathwar, Dahi, Nimkhera, Bara-Barkhera,\nChota-Barkhera, Kacchi-Baroda, Dhotra, Multhan, Dhangaon, and Kali-Baori. The head-quarters of this Agency are at Sardarpur. Besides the above, there was another political agency in the same part of Central India, known as the Deputy Bhil Agency, comprising the following 8 States:\u2014Barwani, Jamnia, Rajgarh, Kothide, Garhi, Chota-Kasrawad, Chiktiabari, and Bharudpura, besides the British District of Manpur, Sindhia's pargan\u00e1 of Bagaud, and Holkar's districts of H\u00e1silpur in M\u00e1lw\u00e1, and Kharg\u00e1on, Mahesar, B\u00e1rwa, Dh\u00e1rg\u00e1on, Sindwa, and Bamang\u00e1on in Nim\u00e1r. The Deputy Bhil Agency has now ceased to exist, having being merged into the Bhil Agency. The territory comprised in Bhilw\u00e1ra lies to the north of the Bombay Bhil States in Kh\u00e1ndesh District, which are noticed under DANG STATES.\n\n\u2014See also BHIL TRIBE.\n\nBhilw\u00e1ra.\u2014Town in Udaipur (Oodeypore) Native State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Situated on the Nimach and Nas\u00edr\u00e1b\u00e1d road, 72 miles distant from each place. Contains some 2000 houses, mostly of traders and shopkeepers. This town, Tod relates, was completely deserted at the close of the Pind\u00e1ri war in 1818; but in more peaceful times it rapidly rose from ruin, and in a few months contained 1200 houses. It is a station on the Holkar and Sindhia-N\u00edmach State Railway, and is considered the second emporium of trade in Udaipur. It is noted for the excellence and durability of its tinning work.\n\nBh\u00edm\u00e1.\u2014River in the Bombay Presidency, rising in lat. $19^\\circ 4' 30''$ N., long. $73^\\circ 34' 30''$ E., at the village of Bh\u00edm\u00e1shankar, situated on the Sahy\u00e1dri Hills in the Kher Sub-division of Poona (Puna) District; flowing south-east through the Districts of Poona, Ahmadnagar, Shol\u00e1pur, and Kal\u00e1dg\u00ed. After forming the north-eastern boundary of the Southern Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Country, it falls into the Kistna.\n\nBh\u00edm\u00e1ganni.\u2014The pass connecting Bellary District, Madras Presidency, on the north-east with the Sand\u00far State.

Inhabited chiefly by Chauh\u00e1n R\u00e1jputs.\n\nBh\u00edm\u00e1varam.\u2014T\u00e1luk in God\u00e1var\u00ed District, Madras Presidency. Area, 321 square miles, containing 139 villages, with 17,092 houses; population (1881) 108,599, being 53,851 males and 54,748 females; revenue, \u00a348,130. The t\u00e1luk possesses abundant means of irrigation, the chief aqueducts being the Undi, the Velpur, the Chinna K\u00e1param, Gosta n\u00e1di, and Akuv\u00edd\u00fa Canals. Numerous minor channels intersect the t\u00e1luk in all directions. The principal towns are Virav\u00e1saram, with 5257 inhabitants; Bh\u00edm\u00e1varam, 2205; Undi, 2445; Akuvidu, 2368;\nGunup\u00fadi, 1620.

The ancient Vaishnav temple on a neighbouring hill is said to have been founded by Agastya-Mal\u00e1i Muni; and on the same hill is a cave temple, the entrance to which is blocked by a large stone image, which the temple guardians will not allow to be removed. The annual festival in honour of Vishnu, known as N\u00e1risinhasw\u00e1mi, is celebrated in April. Population (1881) 1552, namely, Hindus, 1512; Muhammadans, 17; and Christians, 23; inhabiting 316 houses.\n\n**Bhimb\u00e1ndh.**\u2014Hot springs in Monghyr District, Bengal; about 16 miles south of Rishikund. Lat. 25\u00b0 4' N., long. 86\u00b0 27' E. The springs, which are the finest in the District, issue from the eastern base of the Mah\u00e1deo Hill, so near the Man river that they may be considered one of its sources. The hot water issues from four different places at some distance from each other, springing at each place from numerous crevices of the rock. The temperature of the water varies from 144\u00b0 to 150\u00b0 F. in the month of March. It is limpid and tasteless, but contains earthy matter, the stones through which the hottest spring bubbles up being encrusted with a deposit resembling calcareous tufa.\n\n**Bh\u00edmbar.**\u2014Torrent in Gujar\u00e1t District, Punjab. Rises in the second Him\u00e1layan range, drains a considerable valley within the mountain region, passes round the Pabbi Hills, runs due south for 25 miles, and fertilizes a low fringe of land upon its banks. Four miles north-west of Gujar\u00e1t it loses itself in the surface of the country, moistening and enriching the surrounding plain; it collects again near the village of Hari\u00e1lw\u00e1l\u00e1, and runs north-west until it reaches the Jal\u00e1l\u00eda n\u00e1la, a branch of the Chen\u00e1b. An unmanageable stream during the rains, but completely dry in the winter months, leaving its bed a broad waste of sand. Fordable at all points, except for some hours after heavy rains in the hills.\n\n**Bh\u00edm Ghor\u00e1.**\u2014A place of Hindu pilgrimage in Sah\u00e1ranpur District, North-Western Provinces. Lat. 29\u00b0 58' N., long. 78\u00b0 14' E. In a small recess of the mountain bounding the Dehra D\u00fan on the south, and in a perpendicular rock about 350 feet high, is a kund or sacred pool supplied with water from a small branch of the Ganges; and above the pool an excavation in the rock, about 5 feet square, occupied by a fakir. According to the legend, Bh\u00edma was stationed at this point to prevent the Ganges from taking a different course, and the small cave referred to is said to have been made by the kick of the horse on which he was mounted. Pilgrims bathe in this pool, the waters of which are supposed\nto have the power of cleansing from sin. A small temple has recently been built into the rock, from which flights of steps lead down to the sacred pool.\n\n**Bh\u00edml\u00e1th.**\u2014A small Gond village in B\u00e1lg\u00e1h\u00e1t District, Central Provinces, situated on the Bangar river about 64 miles due east of Seoni town. Near the village is a curious stone pillar without inscription, lying on the ground in a grove of mango trees, said by the natives to be the l\u00e1th or club of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bh\u00edma. The village is also noted for having within its borders one of the finest banian trees in the Central Provinces.\n\n**Bhimora.**\u2014Petty State in North K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency, consisting of 12 villages, with 2 independent tribute-payers.

A first-class noble of the State, owning 90 villages, resides here. His palace is on the western side.\n\n**Bhinga.**\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Bahraich District, Oudh; bounded on the\nnorth by Nep\u00e1l State and Tulsipur pargan\u00e1, on the east by Durg\u00e1pur, on the south by Ikauna and Bahraich pargan\u00e1s, and on the west by Charda pargan\u00e1. Formerly comprised partly in Bahraich and partly in the tar\u00e1i pargan\u00e1s of Dangd\u00fan and Behr\u00e1. In 1483 A.D., Dangd\u00fan was held by a hill R\u00e1j\u00e1, named Udatt Singh; and Bher\u00e1 was then probably under the sway of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sangr\u00e1m S\u00e1h, who held the neighbouring pargan\u00e1 of R\u00e1jh\u00e1t. The cis-R\u00e1pt\u00ed tract was held by the Ikauna R\u00e1j\u00e1. Between this date and 1650, the Ikauna chief had extended his sway across the R\u00e1pt\u00ed; and in the time of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n he owned 92 villages in Dangd\u00fan. Part of these, and probably the Bher\u00e1 villages also, were held by a cadet of the house; but the estate, which was always open to the raids of the Banj\u00e1ras, was troublesome to manage, and the t\u00e1lukd\u00e1r, who was connected with the Gonda family by marriage, yielded his rights in favour of Bhaw\u00e1n\u00ed Singh Bisen, younger son of the Gonda R\u00e1j\u00e1. The present t\u00e1lukd\u00e1r is sixth in descent from Bhaw\u00e1n\u00ed Singh. The Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 of Balr\u00e1mpur also possesses a good deal of land in the pargan\u00e1. Bisected by the river R\u00e1pt\u00ed from north-west to south-east, it has well-defined physical features. The basin of the R\u00e1pt\u00ed, and its affluent the Bhakl\u00e1, embrace a do\u00e1b of unusually rich alluvial soil. Skirting the north of this tract is a belt of reserved forest about 4 miles wide, which once contained some fine s\u00e1l timber, but has now little wood of value. North of this again is a tract of low tar\u00e1i land bordering the forest which lies along the lower Him\u00e1layan range, and forming the finest rice-producing ground in Bahraich District. In the southern portion of the pargan\u00e1, wheat and Indian corn are the staples. Irrigation is hardly required. Of a total area of 247 square miles, 140 are returned as under cultivation, 28 as cultivable waste, and 61 as reserved forest. Population (1881) 86,927, namely, 44,981 males and 41,946 females.

Bhiw\u00e1n\u00ed was an insignificant village at the beginning of the present century; but being chosen in 1817 as the site of a free market, it rose rapidly to importance, and became the entrep\u00f4t for trade from Bikaner (Bickaneer), Jaisalm\u00edr (Jeysulmere), and J\u00e1ipur (Jeypore). The opening of the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na State Railway seriously injured the trade of the town. But the Hiss\u00e1r-Rew\u00e1ri branch of the railway, opened in 1883, passes through Bhiw\u00e1n\u00ed, and it is expected that trade will revive. The town stands in an open sandy plain, treeless and uncultivated; good wide\nmetalled streets; suburbs covered with mud hovels, huddled together without order or arrangement.

Bhiw\u0101pur manufactures cloth inferior only to that produced at N\u0101gpur and Umrer. Besides other trade, banking is carried on, chiefly by Agarw\u0101l\u0101 M\u0101rw\u0101ris, who have been long settled here.

It is said to have been founded some three hundred years ago by one Bhogchand, a K\u00e1yasth by caste, whose descendants are still proprietors. To him also is ascribed a large tank, known as Bhog S\u00e1g\u00e1r, the water of which is used for irrigation.\n\n**Bhogr\u00e1i.**\u2014Embankment at the mouth of the Subarnarekha river in Balasor District, Bengal; completed in 1870. An embankment was constructed here by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and afterwards replaced by another built by the British Government. Both of these were constructed too close to the river to allow the free escape of the waters in time of flood, and they were consequently destroyed. The present embankment runs farther back, so as to give sufficient waterway.\n\n**Bhoika.**\u2014Petty Estate of Jh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1r District, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency; consisting of 3 villages, with 1 independent tribute-payer.

A small municipal income in the shape of a house tax for police and conservancy purposes is raised under the provisions of Act xx. of 1856. Two bazars, sard\u00ed (native inn), tahsil, police station, good-sized jhil or lake, modern mosque and temple. The latter contains lodgings free to poor travellers, who also receive a daily dole of grain from the owner. The town was founded, according to tradition, by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bhim Sen, who was cured of leprosy by bathing in the jhil. Bhongaon possessed some importance under the Mughal Emperors, and has a ruined fort on an artificial mound; but its trade has now shifted to towns upon the railway.\n\n**Bhoommawadee.\u2014** Township in Taung-ng\u00fa District, British Burma. \u2014See Bumawadi.\n\n**Bhoon-maw.\u2014** Pagoda in Tenasserim, British Burma. \u2014See Bunmaaw.\n\n**Bhop\u00e1l.\u2014** Native State in M\u00e1lw\u00e1, in the Bhop\u00e1l Political Agency of Central India, under the political superintendence of the Governor-General's Agent for Central India; lying between 22\u00b0 32' and 23\u00b0 46' N. lat., and between 76\u00b0 25' and 78\u00b0 50' E. long.; area, 6873 square miles; estimated revenue, \u00a3400,000; population (1881) 954,901, namely, 498,643 males and 456,258 females, or 139 persons to the square mile. Number of large towns, 4; villages, 3006; houses, 184,808; number of persons per occupied house, 5\u00b716.

Bounded on the north and west by Sindhia's territory and several petty States of the Central India Agency; east by the British District of S\u00e1gar (Saugor); and south by the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda), and by Holkar's territory of Aim\u00e1war. The ruler is a female and an Afgh\u00e1n of the Mir\u00e1zai Khel tribe; she succeeded her mother in 1868, and her daughter Sult\u00e1n Jah\u00e1n Begam is (1884) the recognised heir to the State.\n\nThe Bhop\u00e1l dynasty was founded by Dost Muhammad, an Afgh\u00e1n in the service of Aurangzeb, who took advantage of the revolutions which followed the death of the Emperor to establish his independent\nauthority in Bhop\u00e1l and the neighbouring country. The Bhop\u00e1l family have always manifested an amicable feeling towards the British Government. In 1778, when General Goddard made his bold march across India, the State of Bhop\u00e1l was the only Indian power which showed itself friendly; and in 1809, when another British expedition, commanded by General Close, appeared in that part of India, the Naw\u00e1b of Bhop\u00e1l earnestly, but in vain, petitioned to be received under British protection. The Naw\u00e1b then allied himself with the Pind\u00e1ris, and made a most gallant defence against the attempts of Sindhia and Raghuji Bhonsla to crush him; their efforts were finally restrained by the intervention of the British power. In 1817, at the commencement of the Pind\u00e1ri war, the British Government formed a close alliance with Bhop\u00e1l. It was chiefly by the aid of the Pind\u00e1ris that Bhop\u00e1l had been able to defy the attacks of Sindhia and the R\u00e1ja of N\u00e1gpur; but his connection with these freebooters was distasteful to the Naw\u00e1b, and only tolerated on account of his inability to control them. A treaty was made in 1818, by which the British Government guaranteed his possession of the State; and the Naw\u00e1b agreed to furnish a contingent of 600 horse and 400 infantry, and received five Districts in M\u00e1lw\u00e1 as a reward for his services, and to enable him to maintain the contingent. The Naw\u00e1b soon afterwards met his death from a pistol accidentally discharged by a child. His nephew, an infant, was thereupon declared his successor, and betrothed to the infant daughter of the deceased prince. But the widow of the Naw\u00e1b, the K\u00fadsia Begam, wished to keep the State in her own hands, even after the declared heir had resigned his claim to the State and to the hand of the Naw\u00e1b\u2019s daughter, Sikandar Begam, in favour of his brother Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr Muhamad.\n\nAfter much dissension, lasting through several years, Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr Muhamad was restored to power in 1837 by the mediation of the British Government, and installed as Naw\u00e1b. On his death in 1844, he was succeeded by his widow, Sikandar Begam, who ruled Bhop\u00e1l until her death in 1868. She made a name for herself by faithful services to the Government of India during the Mutiny, and by the ability which she displayed in the management of the State. She was succeeded by the present ruler, Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n Begam, who is no unworthy successor, and is distinguished by the same loyalty to the British Crown. Her first husband died in 1867, leaving her one daughter, Sult\u00e1n Jah\u00e1n Begam. After her husband\u2019s death, Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, following the footsteps of her mother, threw aside the restrictions of the pardah, conducted business with vigour, and was always accessible. In recognition of her high administrative qualities and her loyalty, she received in 1872 the honour of the Grand Cross of the Star of India. In 1871 she contracted a second marriage with\nMaulvi Muhammad Sadik Husain, and has resumed the retirement which the pardah imposes, but continues to conduct personally the business of all departments of the State. Her Nawab consort is not outwardly invested with authority. The same honours are paid to her present husband as were enjoyed by his predecessor, and he has received the title of Nawab. The Sultan Jah\u00e1n Begam, the present heir, was married in 1874, with the consent of Government, to Ahmad Ali Kh\u00e1n, who is of the same tribe as that to which the Bhop\u00e1l family belongs (the Mir\u00e1z\u00e1i Khel), but he is not a member of the family itself. This lady has two sons and one daughter.\n\nThe Begam of Bhop\u00e1l is entitled to a salute of 19 guns. The force maintained by the State consists of 694 horse, 2200 foot, 14 field and 43 other guns, with 291 artillerymen. In commutation of a contingent of 600 horse and 400 infantry known as the Bhop\u00e1l battalion, which the State had stipulated to furnish under treaty, Bhop\u00e1l now pays annually 2 l\u00f3khs of rupees (say \u00a320,000) in cash. A further payment of \u00a3500 is made by the State for the support of the Sehore high school. The contribution of \u00a31200 per annum formerly paid by the State for the construction and repair of roads within its territory was remitted in 1873, on the understanding that the Begam will keep in proper repair the roads already made, and spend a reasonable sum annually in opening up others. In 1875, the amount sanctioned for roads by the Bhop\u00e1l Darb\u00e1r was \u00a3210 per annum, to which the Begam herself added a donation of 1 l\u00f3kh of rupees (\u00a310,000) and the K\u00fadsia Begam \u00a32500 per annum. A branch line, called the 'Bhop\u00e1l State Railway,' leaving the Great Indian Peninsula Railway at It\u00e1rsi station, runs to Bhop\u00e1l via Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d. The cost of this work, fifty l\u00f3khs of rupees (\u00a3500,000), was borne by the Bhop\u00e1l Government, without a guarantee. The extension of the line from Bhop\u00e1l to Bhilsa, Jh\u00e1nsi, and Gwalior, by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, is projected. The British Government has, by a sanad of 1862, recognised the right of succession in Bhop\u00e1l according to Muhammadan law and the customs of the State. The chief has power of life and death in judicial matters; and the territories of Bhop\u00e1l are beyond the jurisdiction of British courts. An allowance of \u00a31000 a year is made by the British Government as compensation for the loss incurred on the remission of transit duty on all salt passing through the State.\n\n**Bhop\u00e1l.**\u2014Principal town of the State of the same name in Central India. Lat. 23\u00b0 15' 35\" N., long. 77\u00b0 25' 56\" E. Height above sea-level, 1670 feet. Surrounded by a masonry wall two miles in circuit, within which is a fort, also of masonry; both in good repair. Outside the town is a ganj or trading quarter; and to the south-west, on a large rock, is a fort called Fatehgarh, with a masonry rampart and square towers\u2014the residence of the ruler of the State. South-west of this\nfort spreads a fine artificial lake, $4\\frac{1}{2}$ miles long and $1\\frac{1}{2}$ mile broad; and on the east of the town another 2 miles in length. From these lakes, by the liberality of the K\u00fadsia Beg\u00e1m, the town is now plentifully supplied with water; the waterworks are in charge of an English engineer, and the water is to be supplied to the people, free, for ever. The Political Agent lives at Sehore, the head-quarters of the Bhop\u00e1l contingent, 20 miles distant from Bhop\u00e1l. Distant from Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d 325 miles south-west; from Calcutta, via Sambalpur and N\u00e1gpur, 790 miles.\n\n**Bhop\u00e1l Agency.**\u2014A collection of Native States, under the political superintendence of the Governor-General\u2019s Agent for Central India. Bounded south and east by the Central Provinces, and north and west by various Native States of Central India and R\u00e1jput\u00e1n\u00e1. Area, about 8719 square miles; estimated population (1881) 1,291,358. The nine States comprising the Agency are **Bhop\u00e1l**, Rajgarh, Narsinhgarh, Kurwai, Maksudangarh, Khilchipur, Basoda, Muhammadgarh, and Pathari, all of which see separately. In addition to the above, the Political Agent whose head-quarters are at Bhop\u00e1l has also charge of isolated patches of territory belonging to the States of Gwalior, Indore, Tonk, and Dew\u00e1s. The following guaranteed Th\u00e1kurates are also included in this Agency, viz. Agra-Barkhera, Dagria, Daria-Kheri, Dhabla-Dhir, Dhabla-Ghosi, Duleta, H\u00edrapur, Jabria, Jh\u00e1lera, Kamalpur, K\u00e1kar-Kheri, Khaj\u00fari, Kharsia, Piplia-nagar, R\u00e1mgarh, Sutalia, and Tappa.\n\n**Bhor.**\u2014Native State within the Political Agency of Sat\u00e1ra, in the Deccan, Bombay Presidency. Estimated area, 1491 square miles; population (1881) 145,872; number of villages, 486; gross revenue, inclusive of import and export duties, about \u00a346,450. Except in one tract, where the land is level, the country is covered with hills. Three-fourths of the soil is red, the remainder is blue and grey; principal products\u2014rice and n\u00e1gli (Eleusine corocana). Bhor is one of the feudatories of the old Sat\u00e1ra r\u00e1j. The family of the chief are Hindus, Br\u00e1hmans by caste, and they hold a sanad authorizing adoption; the family follows the rule of primogeniture, and the succession has been maintained by several adoptions. The Chief holds the title of j\u00e1gird\u00e1r of Bhor and Pant Sachev, and he ranks in the first class of Deccan sard\u00e1rs. He maintains for other than military purposes a retinue of 535 followers. A tribute of \u00a3527, 12s., being the commuted value of elephant subsidy hitherto annually paid to the Chief, is paid to the British Government. There are 25 schools, with 723 pupils.\n\n**Bhor.**\u2014Chief town of the Bhor State in the Deccan, Bombay Presidency; 25 miles south of Poona (P\u00fana). Lat. 18\u00b0 9' N., long. 73\u00b0 53' 25\" E.\n\n**Bhor Gh\u00e1t.**\u2014Pass across the Western Gh\u00e1ts, 40 miles south-east of\nBombay, and about the same distance north-west of Poona (P\u00fana). Lat. $18^\\circ 46' 45''$ N., long $73^\\circ 23' 30''$ E. The carrying of the line of railway up this pass is one of the greatest engineering feats that has been performed in India. The summit is 1831 feet above the level at its base, or 2027 feet above sea-level. The average gradient is 1 in 48. The total length of tunnelling is 2535 yards. There are 8 viaducts, varying from 52 to 168 yards in length, to from 45 to 139 feet high. The total quantity of cuttings was 1,623,102 cubic yards, and of embankments 1,849,934 cubic yards. The maximum height of the embankments is 74 feet. There are 18 bridges of various spans from 7 to 30 feet, and 58 culverts of from 2 to 6 feet span. The estimated cost of the work was \u00a3597,222, or an average of \u00a341,188 per mile. It was completed in February 1861, within five years from the date of its commencement. In former times, the Bhor Gh\u00e1t was considered the key of the Deccan.\n\nIn 1804, General Wellesley gave Bombay greater facilities of access to the Deccan by making the Bhor Gh\u00e1t practicable for artillery, and constructed a good road from the top of the Gh\u00e1t to Poona (P\u00fana); a good carriage road up the Gh\u00e1t was not, however, completed until 1830, when it was opened by Sir John Malcolm, then Governor of Bombay. 'On the 10th November 1830,' he wrote, 'I opened the Bhor Gh\u00e1t, which, though not quite completed, was sufficiently advanced to enable me to drive down with a party of gentlemen in several carriages. It is impossible for me to give a correct idea of this splendid work, which may be said to break down the wall between the Konkan and the Deccan. It will give facility to commerce, be of the greatest of conveniences to troops and travellers, and lessen the expense of European and other articles to all who reside in the Deccan.' Thirty years afterwards another Governor of Bombay, Sir Bartle Frere, at the opening of the Bhor Gh\u00e1t Railway incline, which reaches by one long lift of $15\\frac{1}{2}$ miles the height of 1831 feet, recalled Sir John Malcolm's words and said: 'When I first saw the Gh\u00e1t some years later, we were very proud in Bombay of our mail cart to Poona (P\u00fana), the first, and at that time, I believe, the only one running in India; but it was some years later before the road was generally used for wheeled carriages. I remember that we met hardly a single cart between Khand\u00e1lla and Poona; long droves of pack-bullocks had still exclusive possession of the road, and probably more carts now pass up and down the Gh\u00e1t in a week than were then to be seen on it in a whole year. But the days of mail and bullock carts, as well as of pack-bullocks, are now drawing to a close.' The pack-bullocks, however, still continue to do a thriving business in spite of the completion of the railway.\n\nMr. E. B. Eastwick, in Murray's Handbook for Bombay (London, 1881), thus describes the scenery: 'The beautiful scenery of the\nmountains, and the remarkable character of the incline, make the passage of the Bhor Gh\u00e1t one of the most remarkable stages in Indian travel. In consequence of the reversing station, one portion of the incline is nearly parallel to and much above the other, both being, as it were, terraced 1400 feet directly over the Konkan. In some parts, the line is one half on rock benching, while the other half consists of a very lofty embankment, sometimes retained by a wall of masonry. In other places, on account of the enormous height, embankment is impossible, and while half the width of the railway is on a rock benching, the other half rests on vaulted arches. The viaduct that crosses the Mhau-ki-khind is 163 feet above the footing, and consists of eight semicircular arches of 50 feet span.\n\n**Bhotm\u00e1ri.**\u2014Trading village and produce depot in Rangpur District, Bengal. Lat. 26\u00b0 1' N., long. 89\u00b0 13' E. Chief trade\u2014jute, tobacco, and ginger.\n\n**Bhuban.**\u2014Range of hills in the southern portion of Cachar District, Assam, forming the watershed between the B\u00e1rak and Son\u00e1i rivers. They run north and south at a short distance from the eastern boundary of the District. Their height varies from 700 feet to 3000 feet, and their slopes are very precipitous. An annual pilgrimage takes place to the top of the Bhuban hills, reputed to be one of the residences of the god Siva.\n\n**Bh\u00faj.**\u2014Chief town of the State of Cutch (Kachchh), in political connection with the Bombay Presidency; situated at the base of a fortified hill. Lat. 23\u00b0 15' N., long. 69\u00b0 48' 30\" E. Population (1881) 22,308, including 1647 in cantonments. Hindus numbered 12,506; Muhammadans, 8325; Jains, 1162; Christians, 61; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 34; and 'others,' 220. Bh\u00faj is a municipal town, and has a post-office, a central jail, a high school, a school of art, a library, and a dispensary. Municipal income (1880-81) \u00a3963; expenditure, \u00a31017. The dispensary in the same year treated 11,367 patients, of whom 333 were in-door. The place is chiefly interesting for its arch\u00e6ological monuments, and as having been at an early period dedicated to the snake divinity Bhuj\u00e1nga or Bh\u00fajiya. None of the buildings in the town are of earlier date than the middle of the 16th century. The mosque inside the city gate is remarkable for the thickness of its piers, and their closeness to one another\u2014an arrangement by which only a few of the worshippers can ever be within sight of the rest. The town contains the mausoleums of the R\u00e1os of Cutch; and in its neighbourhood are a number of shrines and Muhammadan dargahs, of no special importance.\n\n**Bhukar.**\u2014Native State of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, Bengal.\u2014See Chang BHUKAR.\n\n**Bhukarheri.**\u2014Town in J\u00e1nsath tahsil, Muzaffarnagar District,\nNorth-Western Provinces. Population (1881) 6195, namely, Hindus, 4795; and Muhammadans, 1400. The village contains a small brick-paved bazar and a few good brick houses. There is no external trade, the bazar being only sufficient to supply the wants of the neighbouring agricultural communities. Connected by road with Barla and Deoband villages in the north-west, and with Bijnaur District across the Ganges.\n\n**Bhullooah** (another name for Noakhali).\u2014District in Bengal.\u2014See NOAKHALLI.\n\n**Bhum** (or Bhim).\u2014Ghat in Madras Presidency.\u2014See CHAMARDI.\n\n**Bhum Bakeswar.**\u2014Group of hot sulphur springs on the banks of the Bakeswar nala, about 1 mile south of Tantipara village in Birbhum District, Bengal. Lat. 23\u00b0 53' 30\" N., long. 87\u00b0 24' 45\" E. The temperature of the water varies from 128\u00b0 to 162\u00b0 F. About 120 cubic feet of water per minute are ejected from the hottest well.\n\n**Bhumawadi** (Bhoommawadee).\u2014Township in Taung-ngu District, Tenasserim, British Burma.\u2014See BUMAWADI.\n\n**Bhung Bara.**\u2014A tract formerly pertaining to Sind, and granted, together with Sabzalkot, in 1843, to the Nawab of Bahawalpur, from whose ancestors it had been wrested by the Talpur Mirs, in reward for services rendered to the British during the first Afghan war. It yielded, when under the Talpur administration, an annual revenue of \u00a36000. Lat. of Bhung town, 28\u00b0 24' N., long. 69\u00b0 50' E.\n\n**Bhun-maw** (Bhoon-maw).\u2014Celebrated pagoda in Talaing Thaunggun village, Tenasserim, British Burma.\u2014See BUN-MAW.\n\n**Bhupalpatnam.**\u2014The most westerly zamindari or estate in the Bastar State, attached to Chandia District, Central Provinces, lying between 18\u00b0 32' 30\" and 19\u00b0 9' N. lat., and between 80\u00b0 18' and 80\u00b0 50' E. long. Area, about 700 miles; population (1881) 9943, namely, 5098 males and 4845 females; number of villages, 111; occupied houses, 1799. The zamindar is a Gond.\n\n**Bhur.**\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Kheri District, Oudh. One of the largest pargans in the Province; in shape an irregular parallelogram, extending from north-west to south-east. Bounded on the north by Palia and Nighasan pargans, the Chauka river marking the boundary line; on the east by Srinagar pargan\u00e1; on the south and west by Shahjah\u00e1npur District of the North-Western Provinces. Area, 376 square miles, of which 135 are under cultivation; population (1881) 73,872 Hindus and 8022 Muhammadans\u2014total, 81,894. Bhur possesses one very marked geographical feature, in the shape of a high ridge or plateau, rising suddenly from 20 to 50 feet in height, running parallel to the river Chauka, which at one time flowed just under it. The tract between this ridge and the present course of the river comprises about one-fourth of the entire pargan\u00e1. It is a low-lying plain, known as the ganiar,\nregularly inundated by the river during the autumn rains, and sparsely inhabited, the villages and hamlets being widely scattered and built upon slightly elevated sites. The upland tract is by far the richest part of the pargan\u00e1, and contains many large and populous villages, some with large masonry buildings, embowered in groves and fruit-trees, and with a dense and apparently prosperous population. Soil excellent, producing luxuriant crops; easy facilities for irrigation.\n\n**Bhurtpore.**\u2014State in R\u00e1jput\u00e1n\u00e1.\u2014See Bhartpur.\n\n**Bhus\u00e1wal.**\u2014Sub-division of Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 571 square miles; contains 3 towns and 185 villages. Population (1881) 96,160, namely, 49,707 males and 46,453 females. Hindus number 85,656; Muhammadans, 7183; 'others,' 3321. To the north-west and along the T\u00e1pt\u00ed the country is flat and monotonous. The south-east of the Sub-division, which stretches into Berar, though flat, is here and there broken by bab\u00fal groves, especially along the banks of the Purna. The rest is more or less undulating, with straggling hillocks covered with loose stones and boulders. Along the north-east boundary runs a bold range of hills. The Sub-division is scantily wooded, and without the mango groves so abundant in other parts of the District. The tract between the Purna river and the hills from the Suki river to the eastern frontier is ruined by its deadly climate, and repeated attempts to re-colonise deserted villages have failed. Elsewhere, the Sub-division is fairly healthy. There is plenty of surface water. Besides the T\u00e1pt\u00ed river in the north, with its tributaries, the Purna and W\u00e1ghar, and the minor streams, the Sur and Bhagavat\u00ed, there are over 2000 irrigation wells in the Sub-division. Of the two kinds of black soil, the rich alluvial clay found north of Edl\u00e1b\u00e1d cannot be surpassed. In the east of Kurha, where it gives place to a rich black loam, it yields the finest crops. The other soils are mostly mixed red and brown. In the north-east the soil is poor, and the waste lands are generally dry and rocky. Along the river-banks are small alluvial plots called dehl\u00ed. Of 566 miles, the total area surveyed in detail, 10 miles are occupied by the lands of alienated villages. The remainder, according to the revenue survey returns, comprises 288,808 acres, or 81'11 per cent. of cultivable land, of which 171,810 acres were under cultivation; 54,567 acres, or 15'32 per cent. of uncultivable land; and 12,709 acres, or 3'57 per cent. of village sites, roads, rivers, and streams. Total land revenue of the Sub-division in 1877-78, \u00a324,350. In 1883, Bhus\u00e1wal contained 1 civil and 3 revenue courts, with 2 police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s); strength of regular police, 118 men; village watchmen (chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs), 395.\n\n**Bhus\u00e1wal.**\u2014Chief town of the Sub-division of the same name in Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay Presidency; 64 miles east of Dh\u00falia. Lat. 21\u00b0 1' 30\" N., long. 75\u00b0 47' E.; population (1881) 9613, of whom\n6738 are Hindus, 1687 Musalm\u00e1ns, 169 Jains, 64 P\u00e1rs\u00eds, and 761 Christians. Sub-judge's court and post-office. Bhus\u00e1wal is the headquarters station of an Assistant Collector and of the chief revenue and police officers of the Sub-division, and the junction station of the N\u00e1gpur branch of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. Until the opening of this railway, it was a petty village in Kh\u00e1ndesh. It has since become an important centre, with large railway works, and a considerable European population. About 1200 workmen are regularly employed here, earning about \u00a32800 a month in wages; about 100 of them are European or Eurasian engine-drivers and mechanics. The demand, occasioned by the residence of so many railway employ\u00e9s, has attracted shopkeepers of all descriptions, but their business is confined to the supply of local wants. The railway premises consist of a handsome station, large locomotive workshop, and houses for the employ\u00e9s. The water supply is brought from the T\u00e1pti by means of a steam pump and pipe. The water is driven up to a large tank in the gardens near the station, set on the top of a handsome two-storied building, the lower storey being used as a billiard room, and the upper as a railway library. Gardens have been laid out, and tree-planting encouraged to such an extent that Bhus\u00e1wal, formerly an open field, is now somewhat overgrown with trees. The village of Bhus\u00e1wal is on the opposite side of the line from the railway buildings. There is a large rest-house outside the railway gate for natives, and opposite to it a small hotel for European travellers. To the north of the railway are the Government courts and offices, school-house, mamlatd\u00e1r's office, railway magistrate's office, sub-jail, subordinate judge's court, telegraph office, etc. Bhus\u00e1wal town was acquired by the British Government with the rest of the Warang\u00e1on (now Bhus\u00e1wal) Sub-division in 1861. It was constituted a municipality in May 1882.\n\n**Bh\u00fat\u00e1n.** \u2014 An independent State in the Eastern Him\u00e1layas, between 26\u00b0 45' and 28\u00b0 N. lat., and between 89\u00b0 and about 92\u00b0 E. long. It is bounded on the north by Tibet; on the east by a tract inhabited by various uncivilised independent mountain tribes; on the south by the British Districts of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 and K\u00e1m\u00edrup of the Province of Assam, and the Bengal District of Jalpaigur\u00ed; and on the west by the independent Native State of Sikkim.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014The whole of Bh\u00fat\u00e1n may be shortly described as a succession of lofty and rugged mountains, abounding in picturesque and sublime scenery. 'The prospect,' says Captain Turner, 'between abrupt and lofty prominences is inconceivably grand; hills clothed to their very summits with trees, dark and deep glens, and the high tops of mountains lost in the clouds, constitute altogether a scene of extraordinary magnificence and sublimity.' As might be expected from its physical structure, this alpine region sends out numerous rivers in a\nsoutherly direction, which, forcing their passage through narrow defiles, and precipitated in cataracts over the precipices, eventually pour themselves into the Brahmaputra. One torrent is mentioned by Turner as falling over so great a height, that it is nearly dissipated in mid-air, and looks from below like a jet of steam. Of the rivers traversing Bhut\u00e1n, the most considerable is the Man\u00e1s, flowing in its progress to the Brahmaputra under the walls of T\u00e1sg\u00e1on, below which it is unfordable. At the foot of T\u00e1sg\u00e1on Hill it is crossed by a suspension bridge. The other principal rivers are the M\u00e1chu, Tchinchu, Torsh\u00e1 M\u00e1l\u00edchu, K\u00far\u00fachu, Dharl\u00e1, Raidak, and Sankosh.\n\nPeople.\u2014Previous to the British annexation of the Dw\u00e1rs, the area of the kingdom was reckoned at about 20,000 square miles. The population of the country now remaining to Bhut\u00e1n was estimated in 1864 at 20,000 souls. Later information, however, points to a larger figure. The population consists of three classes\u2014the priests; the chiefs or Penlows, including the governing class; and the cultivators. The people are industrious, and devote themselves to agriculture, but from the geological structure of the country, and from the insecurity of property, regular husbandry is limited to comparatively few spots. The people are oppressed and poor. \u2018Nothing that a Bhuti\u00e1 possesses is his own,\u2019 wrote the British Envoy in 1864; \u2018he is at all times liable to lose it if it attracts the cupidity of any one more powerful than himself. The lower classes, whether villagers or public servants, are little better than the slaves of higher officials. In regard to them, no rights of property are observed, and they have at once to surrender anything that is demanded of them. There never was, I fancy, a country in which the doctrine of \u201cmight is right\u201d formed more completely the whole and sole law and custom of the land, than it does in Bhut\u00e1n. No official receives a salary; he has certain Districts made over to him, and he may get what he can out of them; a certain portion of his gains he is compelled to send to the Darb\u00e1r; the more he extorts and the more he sends to his superior, the longer his tenure of office is likely to be.\u2019\n\nCaptain Pemberton thus describes their moral condition: \u2018I sometimes saw a few persons in whom the demoralizing influences of such a state of society had yet left a trace of the image in which they were originally created, and where the feelings of nature still exercised their accustomed influence, but the exceptions were rare; and although I have travelled and resided amongst various savage tribes on our frontiers, I have never yet known a people so wholly degraded as the Bhuti\u00e1s.\u2019 Their energies are paralyzed by the nature of their institutions and the insecurity of property, their morals are extremely low, and their numbers reduced by the unnatural system of polyandry and the excessive prevalence of monastic institutions.\nPhysically the Bhuti\u00e1s are a fine race, hardy and vigorous, with dark skins and high cheekbones, but dirty in their habits and persons. Their food consists of meat, chiefly pork, turnips, rice, barley-meal, and tea made from the brick-tea of China. Their favourite drink is chong, distilled from rice or barley and millet, and maru\u00e1, beer made from fermented millet; all classes are very much addicted to the use of intoxicating liquors. A loose woollen coat reaching to the knees, and bound round the waist by a thick fold of cotton cloth, or a leather belt, forms the costume of the men; a legging of broadcloth is attached to a shoe made generally of buffalo hide; no Bhuti\u00e1 ever travels during the winter without protecting his legs and feet against the effects of the snow; a cap made of fur or coarse woollen cloth, completes the habiliment; the women\u2019s dress is a long cloak with loose sleeves. The houses of the Bhuti\u00e1s are of three and four stories; all the floors are neatly boarded with deal; and on two sides of the house is a verandah ornamented with carved work, generally painted. The Bhuti\u00e1s are neat joiners, and their doors, windows, and panelling are perfect in their way. No iron-work is used; the doors open on ingenious wooden hinges. The appearance of the houses is that of Swiss chalets, picturesque and comfortable\u2014the only drawback being a want of chimneys, which the Bhuti\u00e1s do not know how to construct.\n\nThe people nominally profess the Buddhist religion, but in reality their religious exercises are confined to the propitiation of evil spirits, and the mechanical recital of a few sacred sentences; in their religious observances, the most remarkable circumstance is the noise with which they are accompanied. The instruments used are clarionets, sometimes formed of silver and brass, but generally of wood with reed pipes, horns, shells, cymbals, drums, and gongs. Around the cottages in the mountains the land is cleared for cultivation, and produces fair crops of barley, wheat, buckwheat, millet, mustard, chillies, etc. Turnips of excellent quality are extensively grown; they are free from fibre and remarkably sweet. The wheat and barley have a full round grain, and the climate is well adapted to the production of both European and Asiatic vegetables. Potatoes have been introduced. The Bhuti\u00e1s lay out their fields in a series of terraces cut out of the sides of the hills; each terrace is riveted and supported by stone embankments, sometimes 20 feet high. Every field is carefully fenced with pine branches, or protected by a stone wall. A complete system of irrigation permeates the whole cultivated area of a village, the water being often brought from a long distance through stone aqueducts. The Bhuti\u00e1s do not care to extend their cultivation, as an increased revenue is exacted in proportion to the land cultivated, but devote their whole energies to make the land yield twice what it is estimated to produce. The language spoken by the Bhuti\u00e1s is said to be a dialect of the\nTibetan, more or less blended with words and idioms of the countries on which their own territory touches.\n\n**Natural Products.** \u2014 The extensive forests of Bh\u00fat\u00e1n abound in many varieties of stately trees. Among them are the beech, ash, birch, maple, cypress, and yew. Firs and pines cover the mountain heights; and below these, but still at an elevation of 8000 or 9000 feet, is a zone of vegetation consisting principally of oaks and rhododendrons. The cinnamon tree is also found. Some of the roots and branches were examined by Turner during his journey to Tibet; but the plant being neither in blossom nor bearing fruit, it was impossible to decide whether it was the true cinnamon or an inferior kind of cassia. The leaf, however, corresponded with the description given of the true cinnamon by Linn\u00e6us. The lower ranges of the hills teem with animal life. Elephants are so numerous as to be dangerous to travellers; but tigers are not common, except near the river T\u00edst\u00e1. Leopards abound in the valleys, deer everywhere, some of them of a very large species. The musk deer is found in the snows, and the barking deer on every hill-side. Wild hogs are met with even at great elevations. Large squirrels are common. Bears and rhinoceros are also found. Pheasants, jungle fowls, pigeons, and other small game abound. The Bhuti\u00e1s are no sportsmen. They have a superstitious objection to firing a gun, thinking that it offends the deities of the woods and valleys, and brings down rain. A species of horse or rather pony, which seems indigenous to Bh\u00fat\u00e1n, and is used as a domestic animal, is called t\u00e1ngan, from T\u00e1ngast\u00e1n, the general appellation of that assemblage of mountains which constitutes the territory of Bh\u00fat\u00e1n. It is peculiar to this tract, not being found in any of the neighbouring countries of Assam, Nep\u00e1l, Tibet, or Bengal, and unites in an eminent degree the two qualities of strength and beauty. The t\u00e1ngan pony usually stands about 13 hands high, and is short-bodied, clean-limbed, deep in the chest, and extremely active; his colour inclines to piebald.\n\n**Manufactures, etc.** \u2014 In so rude a country, the manufacturing industry of the people is, as might be expected, at a low stage, the few articles produced being all destined for home consumption. These consist of coarse blankets and cotton cloth made by the villagers inhabiting the southern tract. Leather, from the hide of the buffalo, imperfectly tanned, furnishes the soles of snow boots. Circular bowls are neatly turned from various woods. A small quantity of paper is made from a plant described as the Daphne papyrifera. Swords, iron spears, and arrow-heads, and a few copper caldrons fabricated from the metal obtained in the country, complete the list of manufactures. The foreign trade of Bh\u00fat\u00e1n has greatly declined. In 1809, the trade between Assam and Bh\u00fat\u00e1n amounted to \u00a320,000 per annum, the lac,\ntea, spices, gold, assafetida, madder, silk, erendi cloth, and dried fish of Assam being exchanged for the woollens, gold-dust, salt, walnuts, oranges, musk, ponies, and silk of Bhutan. In 1876-77, the entire trade between Bhutan and British India was roughly estimated at \u00a331,000. The exports were \u00a39100 into Assam and \u00a31300 into Bengal; the imports, \u00a320,000 from Assam and \u00a31000 from Bengal. A considerable trade between Lhassa and Assam is carried on through the Towang Bhuti\u00e1s, who are friendly, and occupy the southern slopes of the Himalayas to the eastward of Bhutan proper, of which state they are independent. Eastward of the Towangs are the Char Dw\u00e1r and Thibangia Bhuti\u00e1s, two small and well-behaved clans. The territory of the Towang Bhuti\u00e1s extends to the river Kanta, that of the Char Dw\u00e1r Bhuti\u00e1s from the Kanta to the Ghaben river. In 1882-83, the total export trade from Towang and Bhutan Proper into British India through Assam amounted to \u00a317,879, and the imports from India to \u00a312,131; total value of trade, \u00a330,010. This shows a considerable decrease compared with the returns for the previous year, 1881-82, when the total import and export trade with British India amounted to \u00a340,906. The revenues of Bhutan are usually paid in articles of produce and merchandise.\n\nThe military resources of the country are on an insignificant scale. Beyond the guards for the defence of the various castles, there is nothing like a standing army. The total military force was estimated by the British envoy in 1864 at 6000 men. The chief towns are Punakh\u00e1 or Dosen, the capital, on the left bank of the B\u00fagn\u00ed river, and 96 miles E.N.E from Darjeeling; T\u00e1sichozong, P\u00e1ro, Angdaphorang, and Toungso on the road from Assam to Lhassa. The other towns are Wandipur, Gh\u00e1s\u00e1, and Murichom. Punakh\u00e1 is a place of great natural strength.\n\nMeteorology.\u2014The climate of Bhutan varies according to the difference of elevation; the cold of Siberia, the heat of Africa, and the pleasant warmth of Italy, may all be experienced in a day's journey. At the time when the inhabitants of Punakh\u00e1 (the winter residence of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s) are afraid of exposing themselves to the blazing sun, those of Gh\u00e1s\u00e1 experience all the rigour of winter, and are chilled by perpetual snows. Yet these places are within sight of each other. The rains descend in floods upon the heights, but in the vicinity of T\u00e1sichozong and Punakh\u00e1 they are moderate; there are frequent showers, but nothing that can be compared to the tropical rains of Bengal. Owing to the great elevation and steepness of the mountains, terrible storms arise among the hollows, often attended with fatal results.\n\nHistory.\u2014Bhutan formerly belonged to a tribe called by the Bhuti\u00e1s Teph\u00fa, generally believed to have been the Kochs of Kuch Behar.\nAbout two hundred years ago a band of Tibetan soldiers subjugated the Teph\u00fas, and settled down in the country. At the head of the Bh\u00fat\u00e1n Government there are nominally two supreme authorities, the Dharm R\u00e1j\u00e1, the spiritual head, and the Deb R\u00e1j\u00e1, the temporal ruler, who is elected by the Penlows every three years from their own number. To aid these R\u00e1j\u00e1s in administering the country, is a council of permanent ministers, called the Lenehen. Practically, however, there is no government at all. Subordinate officers and rapacious governors of forts wield all the power of the State, and oppression and anarchy reign over the whole country. The Dharm R\u00e1j\u00e1 is regarded as an incarnation of the deity. On his death a year or two is allowed to elapse; and the new incarnation then reappears in the shape of a child, who generally happens to be born in the family of a principal officer. The child establishes his identity by recognising the cooking utensils, etc. of the late Dharm R\u00e1j\u00e1; he is then trained in a monastery, and on attaining his majority is recognised as R\u00e1j\u00e1, though he exercises no more real authority than he did in his infancy. The Deb R\u00e1j\u00e1 is in theory elected by the council. In practice, he is merely the nominee of whichever of the two governors of East or West Bh\u00fat\u00e1n happens for the time to be the more powerful.\n\nThe relations of the British with Bh\u00fat\u00e1n commenced in 1772, when the Bhuti\u00e1s invaded the principality of Kuch Behar, a dependency of Bengal. The Kuch Behar ruler applied for aid, and a force under Captain James was despatched to his assistance; the invaders were expelled and pursued into their own territory. Upon the intercession of Teshu Lama, then regent of Tibet, a treaty of peace was concluded in 1774 between the East India Company and the ruler of Bh\u00fat\u00e1n. In 1783, Captain Turner was deputed to Bh\u00fat\u00e1n, with a view to promoting commercial intercourse, but his mission proved unsuccessful. From this period few dealings took place with Bh\u00fat\u00e1n, until the occupation of Assam by the British in 1826. It was then discovered that the Bhuti\u00e1s had usurped several tracts of lowland lying at the foot of the mountains, called the Dw\u00e1rs or passes, and for these they agreed to pay a small tribute. They failed to do so, however, and availed themselves of the command of the passes to commit depredations within British territory. Captain Pemberton was accordingly deputed to Bh\u00fat\u00e1n, to adjust the points of difference. But his negotiations yielded no definite result; and every other means of obtaining redress and security proving unsuccessful, the Assam Dw\u00e1rs were wrested from the Bhuti\u00e1s, and the British Government consented to pay to Bh\u00fat\u00e1n a sum of \u00a31000 per annum as compensation for the resumption of their tenure, during the good behaviour of the Bhuti\u00e1s. Continued outrages and aggressions were, however, committed by the\nBhuti\u00e1s on British subjects in the Dw\u00e1rs. Notwithstanding repeated remonstances and threats, scarcely a year passed without the occurrence of several raids in British territory headed by Bhuti\u00e1 officials, in which they plundered the inhabitants, massacred them, or carried them away as slaves.\n\nIn 1863, the Hon. Ashley Eden was sent as an envoy to Bh\u00fat\u00e1n, to demand reparation for these outrages. He did not succeed in his mission; he was subjected to the grossest insults; and under compulsion signed a treaty giving over the disputed territory to Bh\u00fat\u00e1n, and making other concessions extorted by the Bh\u00fat\u00e1n Government. On Mr. Eden\u2019s return, the Viceroy at once disavowed his treaty, stopped the former allowance for the Assam Dw\u00e1rs, and demanded the immediate restoration of all British subjects kidnapped during the last five years. The Bhuti\u00e1s not complying with this demand, the Governor-General issued a proclamation, dated the 12th November 1864, by which the eleven Western or Bengal Dw\u00e1rs were forthwith incorporated with the Queen\u2019s Indian dominions. No resistance was at first offered to the annexation; but, suddenly, in January 1865, the Bhuti\u00e1s surprised the English garrison at Diw\u00e1ngiri, and the post was abandoned with the loss of two mountain guns. The disaster was soon retrieved by General Tombs, and the Bhuti\u00e1s were compelled to sue for peace, which was concluded on the 11th November 1865. The Bh\u00fat\u00e1n Government, in the year following, formally ceded all the eighteen Dw\u00e1rs of Bengal and Assam, with the rest of the territory taken from them, and agreed to liberate all kidnapped British subjects. As the revenues of Bh\u00fat\u00e1n mainly depended on these Dw\u00e1rs, the British Government, in return for these concessions, undertook to pay the Deb and Dharm R\u00e1j\u00e1s annually, subject to the condition of continued good behaviour, an allowance beginning at \u00a32500 and rising gradually to a maximum of twice that amount. Since that time nothing of importance has occurred, and the annexed territories have settled down into peaceful and prosperous British Districts. A few Bhuti\u00e1s inhabit the Eastern Dw\u00e1rs portion of Goalp\u00e1r\u00e1 District in Assam, who resemble in every respect their countrymen of the Bh\u00fat\u00e1n Hills.\n\n**Bh\u00fat\u00e1na.**\u2014Petty State in Jh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1r, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency.\n\n\u2014See Bh\u00e1than.\n\n**Bhuvaneswar.**\u2014The temple city of Siva in Pur\u00ed District, Bengal. Lat. 20\u00b0 14\u2032 45\u2033 N., long. 85\u00b0 52\u2032 26\u2033 E. A sacred place of pilgrimage, and for six centuries the capital of the Siva-worshipping kings of the Kesari or Lion dynasty of Orissa. The founder of the line, Yayati Kesari, began the building of the great fane about 500 A.D.; two succeeding monarchs laboured at it, and the fourth of the house completed it in 657. The last public act of the dynasty was the building of the beautiful vestibule between 1099 and 1104, or little more\nthan a quarter of a century before the extinction of the race. Seven thousand shrines once clustered round the sacred lake of Bhuvaneswar. Not more than 500 or 600 now remain, and these are nearly all deserted and in ruins. They exhibit every stage of Orissa art, from the rough conceptions of the 6th century, through the exquisite designs and ungrudging artistic toil of the 12th, to the hurried and dishonest stucco imitations of Hindu architecture at the present day. A celebrated place of pilgrimage.\n\n**Bhwot-lay.**\u2014River in Pegu, British Burma.\u2014See Pa-de.\n\n**Bi\u00e1na.**\u2014Town in Bhartpur State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. On the route from Agra to Mau (Mhow), 50 miles south-west of the former. Situated on an eminence in a small plain between two ranges of hills running somewhat parallel to each other, from north-east to south-west. Population (1881) 8758, namely, 6907 Hindus, and 1851 Muhammadans. The town is of considerable antiquity and size, and possesses some large well-built houses of stone, besides many temples; and the whole ridge of the hill is covered with the remains of large buildings, among which the most remarkable is the fort containing a high stone pillar called Bh\u00edm L\u00e1t, or the \u2018Staff of Bh\u00edm,\u2019 conspicuous for a great distance through the country. This fort was once esteemed one of the chief strongholds in India, and the bulwark of Jadun dominion. It was held by the Jadun R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bijai P\u00e1l, and was taken (A.D. 1004) by Sayyid S\u00e1lar Mas\u00e1\u00fad, a nephew of the great Musalm\u00e1n conqueror, Mahm\u00fad of Ghazni. There are numerous graves of Muhammadan fanatics, who perished here on the occasion known as \u2018Abu Khandar\u2019 (or more correctly, \u2018Abu Bakr Kandah\u00e1r\u00ed\u2019), a name having reference probably either to the great number of Afgh\u00e1ns who fell during the siege, or to the name and nationality of their leader. Bi\u00e1na is a spot of great sanctity in the eyes of Muhammadans, who declare that if a few more of the followers of the Prophet had received the crown of martyrdom here, the place would have superseded the title for veneration and pilgrimage held by Mecca. Bi\u00e1na is mentioned by Ferishta as a place of importance in 1491, when it stood a siege against Sikandar Lodhi. B\u00e1bar describes it in 1526 as one of the most famous forts in India; it was then held by an Afgh\u00e1n chief who surrendered it to him. In the following year a sanguinary battle was fought near this town between B\u00e1bar and R\u00e1n\u00e1 Sanga, the R\u00e1jput prince of Udaipur (Oodeypore), who was defeated.\n\n**Bi\u00e1ns.**\u2014Pass in Kum\u00e1un District, North-Western Provinces, over the Him\u00e1layan range into Tibet; lying between 30\u00b0 3\u2032 and 30\u00b0 28\u2032 N. lat., and between 80\u00b0 42\u2032 and 80\u00b0 57\u2032 E. long. Has two forks, known respectively as the Lanpiya Dh\u00fara and Mangsh\u00e1 Dh\u00fara, the former of which reaches an elevation of 18,000 feet above sea-level. The Bhuti\u00e1s carry on a trade over these passes by means of y\u00e1ks, goats, and\npack-sheep with Takla Khar, in Tibet,\u2014the imports being salt, gold, wools, drugs, precious stones, and Chinese silks; while the exports comprise grain, cotton, hardware, tobacco, sugar, dyes, and other southern produce. The whole valley is also known by the general name of Bi\u00e1s, and is inhabited by a special class of Bhutias, speaking a peculiar dialect of their own.\n\n**Bi\u00e1s.\u2014One of the five rivers of the Punjab.**\u2014See Beas.\n\n**Bi\u00e1s.\u2014River rising in the hills of Sirmau in Bhop\u00e1l State, close to the south-western boundary of S\u00e1gar (Saugor) District, Central Provinces; flows in a north-easterly direction, passing, within 10 miles of S\u00e1gar, beneath a fine iron suspension bridge of 200 feet span, built by Colonel Presgrave in 1832, and falls into the Son\u00e1r near Narsinghgarh, in Damoh District.**\n\n**Bichhraud.**\u2014Guaranteed Th\u00e1kurate under the Western M\u00e1lw\u00e1 Agency of Central India.\n\n**Bickaneer.\u2014State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na.**\u2014See Bikaner.\n\n**B\u00eddar (Bedar).\u2014Town in the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s Dominions, Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyder\u00e1b\u00e1d), Deccan; situated near the right bank of the Manjera, 75 miles north-west of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d town. Lat. 17\u00b0 53' N., long. 77\u00b0 34' E. It was the capital of the B\u00e1hmani Muhamadan dynasty, which ruled up to the middle of the 16th century. The town is surrounded by an extensive curtain, now much dilapidated, on one of the bastions of which lies an old gun 21 feet long. There is a minaret in the town 100 feet high, and on a plain to the south-west stand many large tombs. The place is noted for the metal ware to which it has given its name. This is an alloy of copper, lead, tin, and zinc, which is worked into articles of very elegant design, inlaid generally with silver, but sometimes also with gold. An interesting account of the manufacture, which is said to be gradually dying out, will be found in Balfour\u2019s Cyclop\u00e6dia of India, vol. i. pp. 369, 370.\n\n**Bidesir.\u2014Town in Bikaner (Bickaneer) State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na; lat. 27\u00b0 48' 50\" N., long. 74\u00b0 22' 15\" E., about 60 miles from Bikaner. Captain Powlett, in the Gazetteer of Bikaner, says of this place: A number of wealthy Seths live here, chiefly Osw\u00e1ls, of whom there are 224 houses. Of Agarw\u00e1l\u00e1s, there are about 18 houses. Perhaps 30 of these are rich men. Bidesir is not a place of manufacture or much trade. The bazaar contains about 136 shops, and there are 10 temples, and almost as many chhatris. Fairly good water is reached at the depth of about 100 feet below the surface. Inferior sand and limestone are obtained in the neighbourhood. Post-office.**\n\n**Bidhuna.\u2014North-eastern tahsil of Et\u00e1wah District, North-Western Provinces.

The village is only important as the head-quarters of the tahsil, which were removed here after the Mutiny on account of the more central position of the present site. Bidh\u00fana is connected with the Achalda station, on the East Indian Railway, by a raised and bridged road. North of the village are the ruins of an old fort. Market twice a week.

Area, 1\u00bc square mile; estimated revenue (1882) \u00a3150, of which \u00a35 is paid as tribute to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda. The chief has the title of Th\u00e1kur.\n\n**Bihta Gos\u00e1in.**\u2014Town in Bilsi tahs\u00edl, Bud\u00e1un District, North-Western Provinces, situated at the intersection of the roads from Bilsi to Isl\u00e1mnagar, and from Sahasw\u00e1n to Bisauli. A small sum is raised by means of a house-tax, under the provisions of Act xx. of 1856, for police and conservancy purposes. Bihta Gos\u00e1in was the first village of the District to suffer from disturbances on the outbreak of the Mutiny in May 1857.\n\n**Bija.**\u2014One of the Simla Hill States, in political connection with the Punjab Government. Lat. (centre) 30\u00b0 56\u2032 N., long. 77\u00b0 2\u2032 E.; area, 4 square miles; 33 villages; population (1881) 1158, namely, 771 Hindus, 363 Sikhs, and 24 Muhammadans. The chief or Th\u00e1kur holds his lands under a sanad in the usual terms, being confirmed in all his rights on condition of paying tribute to defray the expenses of British protection, promoting the welfare of the r\u00fayats and the cultivation of the land, and maintaining the security of the roads. The present Th\u00e1kur is named Ud\u00e1i Ch\u00e1nd, of R\u00e1jput caste. He receives \u00a310 a year as compensation for lands required for Kasauli cantonment. Revenue of the State, \u00a3100; military and police, 20 men. Tribute paid to the British Government, \u00a318.\n\n**Bij\u00e1g\u00e1rh.**\u2014Ruined hill-fort among the S\u00e1tpura hills, in ancient times the capital of the province of Nim\u00e1r. Lat. 21\u00b0 36\u2032 N., long. 75\u00b0 39\u2032 E. The modern district of Holkar, known as Bij\u00e1g\u00e1rh, has taken its name from this fortress. With the exception of the small district of Barw\u00e1n\u00ed, the C\u00edrcar of Bij\u00e1g\u00e1rh comprises nearly the whole of Southern Nim\u00e1r. In 1796 it yielded a revenue of \u00a315,000, but in 1820 only \u00a35000.\n\n**Bijaig\u00e1rh.**\u2014Ruined fort in Mirz\u00e1pur District, North-Western Provinces. Lat. 24\u00b0 34\u2032 38\u2033 N., long. 83\u00b0 13\u2032 35\u2033 E. Perched on the summit of a wooded height, 9 miles north of river Son (Soane), and 50\nmiles south of Benares. The hill was no doubt occupied in very early times, but the existing fortress is attributed to the Emperor Sher Shah. It was subsequently occupied by the Chandel Raja of Bijaigarh, but was seized by Balwant Singh, the founder of the family of the Raja of Benares, about 1772. In 1781, his son Chait Singh, in his rebellion against Warren Hastings, took refuge in this fort, but, on the advance of Major Popham, fled precipitately with all the treasure he could remove. His wife and mother, who remained, defended the fortress for a time, but finally surrendered to the British.\n\n**Bijaigarh.**\u2014Town in Aligarh District, North-Western Provinces. Area, 41 acres. Agricultural town, advancing in prosperity. School, post-office, ancient fort. Held in 1803 by Bhagwant Singh, who was not dislodged without trouble. Monument to Colonel Gordon, killed by an accidental explosion after the capture of the fort. Distant 12 miles from Aligarh, 10 miles from Sikandra.\n\n**Bijapur.**\u2014Sub-division of Kaladgi District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 869 square miles, with 1 village and 91 towns; occupied houses, 12,657; population (1881) 76,896, namely, 38,235 males and 38,661 females. Hindus number 66,853; Muhammadans, 9646; and 'others,' 397. The soil of this tract is very fertile in the valley of the Dhow, but in other parts it is barren, owing to the undulating nature of the country, which, though destitute of trees, is well supplied with water. Climate dry and healthy. The Sub-division contains 1 civil and 4 criminal courts, with 7 police stations (thands); strength of regular police, 80 men; village watchmen (chaukidars), 389.\n\n**Bijapur (Vijayapura).**\u2014Chief town of the Sub-division of the same name in Kaladgi District, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 16\u00b0 49' 45\" N., long. 75\u00b0 46' 5\" E. Fifty-two miles north-east of Kaladgi, 130 miles south-east of Satara, and 160 miles south-east of Poona. Population (1881) 11,424, namely, 8,422 Hindus, 2,931 Musalmans, 42 Jains, 8 Christians, and 21 Parsis. Area of town site, 1,361 acres. Municipal revenue in 1880-81, \u00a3234; rate of taxation, 4\u00bdd. per head of population (11,757) within municipal limits; municipal expenditure in the same year, \u00a3253. Sub-judge's court, post-office, railway station, and dispensary. Bijapur has been recently made the head-quarters of Kaladgi District.\n\nThe founder of the Musalman State of Bijapur was, according to Ferishta, a son of Murad II., the Osmanli Sultan, on whose death his son and successor, Muhammad II., gave orders that all his own brothers should be strangled. From this fate one only, named Yusaf, escaped by a stratagem of his mother. After many adventures, Yusaf is said to have entered the service of the King of Ahmadabad-Bidar, where he rose to the highest offices of state. On the king's death, he withdrew from Ahmadabad to Bijapur, and declared himself its king; the\npeople readily acknowledged his claim. Yusaf reigned with great prosperity, and, extending his dominions westward to the sea-coast, took Goa from the Portuguese. His resources must have been considerable, as he built the vast citadel of Bij\u00e1pur. He died in 1510, and was succeeded by his son Ism\u00e1\u00edl, who died in 1534, after a brilliant and prosperous reign. Mulu Adil Sh\u00e1h having been deposed and blinded, after an inglorious reign of only six months, made way for his younger brother Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm, a profligate man, who died in 1557. He was succeeded by his son Ali Adil Sh\u00e1h, who constructed the wall of Bij\u00e1pur, the Jam\u00e1 Masjid, or great mosque, the aqueducts and other works. This ruler joined the kings of Ahmadnagar and Golconda against R\u00e1j\u00e1 R\u00e1m, the Hindu sovereign of Vijayanagar, and, with the exception of the Emperor of Delhi, was the greatest potentate in India. R\u00e1j\u00e1 R\u00e1m was defeated in 1564 in a great battle at T\u00e1l\u00edkot on the river Dhon, and, being made prisoner, was put to death in cold blood, and his capital taken and sacked. Ali Adil Sh\u00e1h died in 1579.\n\nThe throne then passed to his nephew, Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Adil II., an infant, whose affairs were managed by Ch\u00e1nd B\u00edb\u00ed, widow of the late king, a woman celebrated for her talents and energy. On Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm assuming the government, he ruled with ability; and, dying in 1626, after a reign of forty-seven years, was succeeded by Muhammad Adil Sh\u00e1h, under whose reign Sivaj\u00ed, the founder of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 power, rose into notice. Sh\u00e1hj\u00ed, the father of Sivaj\u00ed, had been an officer in the service of the King of Bij\u00e1pur; and the first aggressions of Sivaji were made at the expense of that State, from which, in the interval between 1646 and 1648, he wrested several forts. Soon afterwards he took possession of the greater part of the Konkan. Muhammad, however, had a more formidable enemy in the Mughal Emperor, Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, whose son and general, Aurangzeb, besieged the city of Bij\u00e1pur, and was on the point of taking it, when he precipitately marched to Agra, whither he was drawn by intelligence of court intrigues, which he feared might end in his own destruction. After his departure, the power of Sivaji rapidly increased, and that of the King of Bij\u00e1pur proportionately declined. Muhammad died in 1660, and was succeeded by Ali Adil II., who, on his decease in 1672, left the kingdom, then fast descending to ruin, to his infant son, Sikandar Adil Sh\u00e1h, the last of the race who occupied the throne.\n\nIn 1686, Aurangzeb took Bij\u00e1pur, and put an end to its existence as an independent State. Its vast and wonderful ruins passed, with the adjoining territory, to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s during the decline of the Delhi empire. On the overthrow of the Peshw\u00e1, in 1818, they came into the hands of the British Government, and were included within the territory assigned to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sat\u00e1ra, who manifested\nmuch anxiety for the preservation of the splendid remains of Muhammadan grandeur in Bij\u00e1pur, and adopted measures for their repair. Since the escheat of Sat\u00e1ra in 1848, from failure of heirs, the Bombay Government has acted in the same spirit, having taken measures, with the approbation of the authorities in England, for arresting the further progress of dilapidation in the buildings, as well as for collecting and preserving the relics of manuscripts, coins, copper-plate inscriptions, and other curious and interesting memorials of the past. On the transfer of the head-quarters of Kal\u00e1dgi District to Bij\u00e1pur, many of the old Muhammadan palaces were utilised for public purposes. For a detailed description of the numerous architectural works found in Bij\u00e1pur, the reader is referred to the admirable account given by Fergusson in his History of Indian and Eastern Architecture, pp. 557\u2013567.\n\n**Bij\u00e1pur.**\u2014Estate or zam\u00ednd\u00e1r\u00ed in the Bargarh tahsil of Sambalpur District, Central Provinces. Area, 80 square miles; number of villages, 57; occupied houses, 3528; population (1881) 14,722, namely, 7415 males and 7307 females.\n\n**Bij\u00e1war.**\u2014Native State in Bundelkhand, Central India, lying between 24\u00b0 21' 30\" and 24\u00b0 57' N. lat., and between 79\u00b0 1' 45\" and 79\u00b0 57' E. long.; area (1881) 973 square miles; number of villages, 298; occupied houses, 21,877; population (1881) 113,285, namely, Hindus, 108,246; Jains, 2506; Muhammadans, 2405; Christians, 5; aboriginal tribes, 123; density of population per square mile, 106\u00b735; revenue, \u00a322,500. The land is poor and hilly, yielding only jungle produce and the poorer kinds of grain. Diamonds are found, and ironstone is plentiful throughout the State. The title of the present ruler, Sawai Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Bh\u00e1n Prat\u00e1p Singh, a Bundela R\u00e1jput, results from his descent from Bir Singh Deo, a natural son of Jagat R\u00e1j, son of Chhatar S\u00e1l, the founder of the short-lived independence of Bundelkhand. After the acquisition of Bundelkhand by the East India Company, a grant was made in 1811, confirming the right of Ratan Singh, then R\u00e1j\u00e1, from whom the estate has descended to its present Chief.\n\nA sanad granting the right of adoption was given to the Chief of Bij\u00e1war in 1862; and, for services during the Mutiny, he received for himself and his heirs a dress of honour and a salute of 11 guns. The State pays no tribute, but keeps up a contingent of 100 horse, with 800 infantry, 4 guns, and 32 gunners. The title of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1, and the exercise of supreme criminal jurisdiction within his territories, was granted to the Chief in 1866. The principal town is Bij\u00e1war, situated in lat. 24\u00b0 37' N., long. 79\u00b0 31' E.\n\n**Bij\u00e1ya.**\u2014Pass in Vizagapatam District, Madras Presidency, leading from Parvat\u00edpur to Jaipur (Jeypore). The head of the pass rises to 3000 feet above the sea, the average gradient being 1 in 20.\nBij\u00e1yanagar.\u2014Ruined city in Bellary District, Madras Presidency. \u2014See Hampi.\n\nB\u00edjbah\u00e1r.\u2014Town in Kashmir State, Punjab.\u2014See B\u00edjbharu.\n\nB\u00edjb\u00e1ni.\u2014Town in Champ\u00e1ran District, Bengal. Lat. 26\u00b0 51' 30\" N., long. 85\u00b0 10' E. Market twice a week.\n\nB\u00edjbharu.\u2014Town in Kashmir State, Punjab, lying on the banks of the Jhelum (Jehlam) river, about 25 miles south-east of Sr\u00ednagar, in lat. 33\u00b0 47' N., and long. 75\u00b0 13' E. The second city in importance and population in the Kashmir valley, containing a temple to Siva under his title of Bajeswar. Thornton notices its singular wooden bridge and large b\u00e1z\u00e1r, but states that the town contains nothing else worthy of special record.\n\nBijegarh.\u2014Town in Aligarh District, North-Western Provinces.\u2014See Bijag\u00e1rah.\n\nBijepr.\u2014Town in Udaipur (Oodeypore) Native State, Rajput\u00e1na. Situated in one of the largest valleys in the range of hills to the east of Chitor. There is a large sheet of water to the north of the town, formed by a massive stone dam. The town is the residence of a second-class noble of the State, who owns 81 villages.\n\nBijer\u00e1ghogarh.\u2014Tract of country in Jabalpur (Jubbulpore) District, Central Provinces, lying between 23\u00b0 43' 45\" and 24\u00b0 8' N. lat., and between 80\u00b0 23' 30\" and 81\u00b0 E. long. Bounded north by M\u00e1ihar State, east by Rewah, and west by the Murw\u00e1ra tahsil and Pann\u00e1. Population (1881) 86,276; area, about 750 square miles. Formerly a protected chiefship belonging to a branch of the family which owns Maihar, but confiscated on account of excesses committed by the chief in 1857. Chiefly agricultural, but there is some fine timber in the portion preserved as a Government forest. Iron is found in several places, and is smelted after the rough native method.\n\nBijer\u00e1ghogarh.\u2014Village in Murw\u00e1ra tahsil, Jabalpur (Jubbulpore) District, Central Provinces. Population (1881) 2645, namely, Hindus, 2129; Kabirpanthis, 214; Muhammadans, 301; aboriginal, 1. The town contains a handsome but comparatively recent fort, formerly the residence of the chiefs, but now used as revenue and police offices. The grounds attached to the fort are kept up as a public garden.\n\nBijipur.\u2014One of the seven Khand mutt\u00e1s of Vizagapatam District, Madras Presidency. Formerly proscribed by the Meriah Agency as addicted to human sacrifice. It consists of 9 villages, and forms part of the G\u00fan\u00e1pur taluk, being separated from Ponk\u00e1la, the next stage, by a dense s\u00e1l jungle 9 miles in extent.\n\nBijji.\u2014Zamind\u00e1ri, or large estate in Bastar State, Central Provinces; situated between 17\u00b0 46' and 18\u00b0 23' 15\" N. lat., and between 80\u00b0 58' and 81\u00b0 34' E. long. Contains 85 small villages; area, about 850 square miles; population (1881) 10,529, namely, 5514 males and 5015\nfemales. Its teak forests, though greatly overworked, still supply timber for export, which is dragged either to the God\u00e1var\u00ed at Parns\u00e1l\u00e1, or the Sab\u00e1ri at Kunt\u00e1, and floated down to the sea.\n\n**Bijl\u00ed.**\u2014Zam\u00edn\u0111\u00e1r\u00ed or estate on the north-east border of Bhand\u00e1ra District, Central Provinces. Population (1881) 17,437; number of villages, 46, exclusive of two shikm\u00ed zam\u00edn\u0111\u00e1r\u00eds or minor estates, namely, Salekas\u00e1 and Darekas\u00e1, the former consisting of 7, and the latter of 15 villages; area, 129 square miles, of which 25 are cultivated. The forests produce much valuable timber. One of the main District roads to R\u00e1ipur passes through this chiefship, leaving it by Darekas\u00e1 Pass, which has lately been repaired. The hills near the pass contain some curious caves, partly artificial, called Kachagarh, 'or forts of safety,' and which must have been very useful as a refuge in former days, possessing a good water supply, and being difficult of approach, owing to the denseness of the bamboo jungle. The difficulty of approach through the dense bamboo jungle, and the advantage of a spring of water close by, justify the name. Just below the pass, the Kuard\u00e1s stream falls from a height of about 50 feet into a large pool of very deep water. The Banj\u00e1r\u00e1s make this picturesque spot a favourite camping ground. The N\u00e1gpur and Chhat\u00edsgarh State Railway runs through a tunnel under Darekas\u00e1 hill, cut out of the solid rock, and 750 feet long.\n\n**Bijn\u00e1.**\u2014One of the Hasht-Bh\u00e1i j\u00e1g\u00edrs in Bundelkhand, under the Central India Agency and the Government of India. Area, 27 square miles, much sub-divided; population (1881) 2084; revenue, \u00a3800. There are 4 of these j\u00e1g\u00edrs\u2014Dhurw\u00e1i, Bijn\u00e1, Tori Fatehpur, and Pah\u00e1ri B\u00e1nk\u00e1. They originally belonged to the Orchha or Tehri State, and were called Hasht-Bh\u00e1i because the Diw\u00e1n Rai Singh divided his j\u00e1g\u00edr of Bar\u00e1g\u00e1on among his eight sons, and these shares have now become merged into four. The present j\u00e1g\u00edrdar of Bijn\u00e1 is Makund Singh, a Hindu Bundela. The four j\u00e1g\u00edrdars keep up a total military force of 15 guns, 50 horse, and 530 foot.\n\n**Bijn\u00e1.**\u2014Town in Bijn\u00e1 State, Bundelkhand, Central India Agency. Lat. 25\u00b0 27' 10\" N., long. 79\u00b0 5' 15\" E. The principal place in the State of the same name. Situated on the route from B\u00e1nda to Jh\u00e1nsi, 95 miles west of former, 49 east of latter.\n\n**Bijnaur (Bijnor).**\u2014District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the North-Western Provinces, lying between 29\u00b0 1' 30\" and 29\u00b0 58' N. lat., and between 78\u00b0 2' and 79\u00b0 E. long.; area 1867\u00b77 square miles; population (1881) 721,450 souls. Bijnaur is the northernmost District of the Rohilkhand Division, and is bounded on the north-east by the sub-montane road, which separates it from the foot of the Kum\u00e1un and Garhw\u00e1l hills; on the west by the river Ganges, which separates it from Dehra D\u00fan, Sah\u00e1ranpur, Muzaffarnagar and Meerut (Merath) Districts;\nand on the south and south-east by Mor\u00e1d\u00e1b\u00e1d, Tar\u00e1i, and Kum\u00e1un Districts. The administrative head-quarters are at the town of Bijnaur.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District of Bijnaur, an irregular triangle, whose apex points directly northward, forms the uppermost portion of the Rohilkhand plain, stretching like a narrow wedge between the valley of the Ganges and the hills of British Garhw\u00e1l. Its eastern boundary consists of the low outer Him\u00e1layan range, which subsides into a submontane tract as it reaches the borders of the District, while on the north is a system of small elevations, known as the Ch\u00e1nd\u00ed Hills, a spur of the Garhw\u00e1l range, and resembling in geological formation the Siw\u00e1l\u00edk range in Dehra D\u00fan on the opposite bank of the Ganges. They cover an area of about 25 square miles. Their barren, rugged, and waterless slopes afford no inducements for cultivation, and they remain accordingly quite without inhabitants to the present day. The submontane eastern tract, known as the bh\u00e1bar, is covered with a belt of forest, interspersed from time to time with open glades of grass, which supply rich pasturage for numerous herds of cattle from all parts of the District. No tar\u00e1i or marshy fringe intervenes in Bijnaur, as in the country to the east, between this forest region and the cultivated plain. The whole of the south and west consists of an open upland, with a general elevation of 800 feet above sea-level, covered throughout with prosperous tillage.\n\nThe soil of this higher plateau always contains sand, in varying proportions, but seldom to such an extent as to render the land uncultivable. The Ganges bank is lined by a strip of alluvial lowland, the wider valley of the sacred river, much of which lies too low for cultivation, while the remainder produces excellent crops of rice. This swampy portion, however, continually decreases from year to year, and most of the lowland is now available for purposes of agriculture. Numerous minor streams intersect the country between the hills and the Ganges, forming furious torrents in the rainy season, and shrinking into narrow threads of water after long-continued drought. The belt of forest area along the eastern frontier covers an average breadth of four miles, and has a total area of 370\u00b703 square miles. In some tracts the tree forest is unbroken throughout the whole breadth of the belt, but in most places it is interspersed with grassy glades utilized for grazing.\n\nThe timber grown throughout the greater portion of the tract is of little value, consisting largely of dh\u00e1k (Butea frondosa), simul (Bombax Malabaricum), and other inferior trees. But east of Behar, in pargan\u00e1 Afzalgarh, there is a block of s\u00e1l (Shorea robusta) forest, measuring over 25 square miles; and a few smaller plantations of the same valuable trees are scattered at rare intervals over the rest of the belt. The shisham or Indian rosewood (Dalbergia Sissoo) is also found in fair quantities. Of the total forest area, over 100 square miles are Govern-\nment property. The mineral products of the District consist only of a scanty supply of *kankar* or nodular limestone, not sufficient, however, to supply local wants. The Ch\u00e1nd\u00ed Hills and the forest belt give shelter to numberless wild animals, while the comparative seclusion of the eastern country secures excellent sport to occasional visitors. The fauna includes the tiger and the wild elephant, besides the usual game, birds, and fish. The proximity of the Ganges and the hills, together with the large forest area, keep the climate comparatively moist, and impart a pleasant greenness to the open plains.\n\n**History.**\u2014Bijnaur can lay little claim to historical importance, as it remained a mere distant portion of the Rohill\u00e1 dominion until the extinction of their authority by the Oudh Waz\u00edrs, and never bore a conspicuous part in the annals of Upper India. Nevertheless, it makes an early appearance in literature, since Hwen Thsang, the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim of the 7th century A.D., mentions Mand\u00e1war, 8 miles north of Bijnaur, as, even at that date, a flourishing city. About the year 1114, some Agarw\u00e1l\u00e1 Baniy\u00e1s, from Mur\u00e1ri in Meerut (Merath) District, crossed the Ganges into this tract, and, finding Mand\u00e1war in ruins, restored it and settled on the spot. In 1400, Tim\u00far visited Bijnaur, committing his usual atrocities; massacred a large number of the inhabitants, and gained a decisive victory in a battle near L\u00e1l Dhang. Thence he marched to Hardw\u00e1r, and crossed into the Do\u00e1b. We hear no more of the District till the time of Akbar, when it formed part of the Sark\u00e1r of Sambhal in the Subah\u00e1t of Delhi. Most of the existing fiscal sub-divisions may be found in Akbar\u2019s great revenue list under the names which they still retain. The larger part of the soil had already been brought under cultivation, and the large revenue which it afforded to the Mughal Emperors sufficiently proves its rising prosperity.\n\nDuring the most prosperous age of the Delhi Empire, Bijnaur seems to have shared in the general freedom from historical incidents, which was the happy lot of regions remote from court intrigue and dynastic quarrels. But as the power of the Mughals relaxed, the Rohill\u00e1 Afgh\u00e1ns appeared upon the scene in Upper India, and settled in the tract to the east of the Ganges about the year 1700. *(See Bareilly District.)* Their first great leader, Ali Muhammad, received a grant of the neighbouring country, which bore thenceforth the name of Rohilkhand. The Subahd\u00e1r of Oudh quarrelled with the new-comer, and induced the Emperor Muhammad Sh\u00e1h to march against him. Ali Muhammad surrendered to the Emperor, gained the favour of his suzerain, and was reinstated in his government about the year 1748. On his death he left his territories to his sons, under the guardianship of H\u00e1fiz R\u00e1hmat Kh\u00e1n, the national hero of Rohill\u00e1 legend. In 1771, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, having placed the puppet Emperor Sh\u00e1h Alam on the\nthrone of Delhi, turned their attention to the subjugation of Rohilkhand. The Rohill\u00e1s sought assistance from the Wazir of Oudh in 1772, but the Wazir betrayed their trust, and, borrowing troops from the British and the Emperor, attacked and subjugated Rohilkhand in a merciless campaign. The treaty by which the Rohill\u00e1s ceded their territory to the Wazir, with the exception of the Rampur State, reserved for Faiz-ull\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n, a son of Ali Muhammad, was concluded at L\u00e1l Dhang in this District in 1774.\n\nThis incident forms almost the only notice of Bijnaur which can be gleaned from the scanty Rohill\u00e1 and Path\u00e1n narratives. The District doubtless shared in the general good government of Rohilkhand during its independent period, while, from its northern position, it probably escaped in great part the desolating effects of the war of subjugation. The large number of considerable Musalm\u00e1n towns, and the general high state of cultivation, both point to long-continued prosperity in this isolated nook. Bijnaur was ceded to the British, with the neighbouring southern country, in 1801. Up till 1817, it formed a part of Mor\u00e1d\u00e1b\u00e1d District, being known as the Northern Division, but in that year it was erected into a separate charge. The administrative head-quarters were originally fixed at Nag\u00edna, the largest town of the District, but were removed to Bijnaur in 1824, both on account of its superior sanitary conditions and its proximity to the important military station at Meerut. The only event of note between the British occupation and the Mutiny was the defeat of Am\u00edr Kh\u00e1n of Tonk, near Afzalgarh, in 1803, by the British troops under Colonel Skinner, founder of the well-known landowning family.\n\nThe news of the Meerut outbreak reached Bijnaur on May 13, 1857. The R\u00fark\u00ed (Roorkee) sappers mutinied and reached Bijnaur on the 19th, but they passed on without creating any disturbance, and the District remained quiet till the 1st of June. On that date, the Naw\u00e1b of Naj\u00edb\u00e1b\u00e1d appeared at Bijnaur with 200 armed Path\u00e1ns. On the 8th, after the outbreaks at Bareilly and Mor\u00e1d\u00e1b\u00e1d, the European officers quitted Bijnaur, and reached R\u00fark\u00ed on the 11th. The Naw\u00e1b at once proclaimed himself as ruler, and remained in power till the 6th August, when the Hindus of the District rose against the Musalm\u00e1n authority and defeated him for the time. On the 24th, the Muhammadans returned in force and drove out the Hindus. The latter attacked their conquerors again on the 18th of September, but without success, and the Naw\u00e1b ruled unopposed until the 17th April 1858. Our troops then crossed the Ganges, and utterly defeated the rebels at Nag\u00edna on the 21st. British authority was immediately re-established, and has not since been disturbed.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1853 returned the total population of Bijnaur at 695,521 persons. The enumeration in 1872, on an area the\nsame as the present District, disclosed a total population of 737,153. Since then the population has declined, and the last Census in 1881 returned the population at 721,450, showing a decrease of 15,703, or 2.13 per cent. in the nine years. The male population in 1881 numbered 383,258, and the female 338,192, dwelling in 2040 towns and villages and 84,871 houses. Average density of population, 386.2 per square mile; towns or villages per square mile, 1.09; houses per square mile, 45.4; inmates per occupied house, 8.5. As regards the religious distinctions of the people, Bijnaur is noticeable among the Districts of the North-Western Provinces for the large proportion of its Musalm\u00e1n inhabitants. The Census shows 484,334 Hindus, or 67 per cent., as against 236,073 Muhammadans, or 33 per cent. The unusual number of Musalm\u00e1ns is doubtless due to the thick sprinkling of considerable towns, whose population consists in great part of Shaikhs, Sayyids, and Path\u00e1ns. The District also contained 299 Christians, 725 Jains, and 18 Sikhs at the date of the Census. Of the various Hindu castes, Br\u00e1hmans numbered 27,775; R\u00e1jputs, 18,537; Baniy\u00e1s, 15,939; Ah\u00edrs, 5520; Cham\u00e1rs, or landless agriculturists, just emerging from serfdom, 105,674; and K\u00e1yasths, 3552. Regarding the occupations of the people, the Census Report returns the male population under the following six main heads:\u2014(1) Professional class, including Government officials and the learned professions, 9349; (2) domestic servants, hotel and lodging-house keepers, etc., 1435; (3) commercial class, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 10,139; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 149,462; (5) manufacturing, artisan, and other industrial classes, 66,213; (6) indefinite and non-productive (comprising 15,164 general labourers, and 131,496 unspecified, including male children), 146,660. The District contains no fewer than 13 towns with a population exceeding 5000 souls, namely, Bijnaur, 15,147; Najibabad, 17,750; Sherkot, 15,087; Chandpur, 11,182; Nagina, 20,503; Sehora, 9014; Sahispur, 6338; Dhampur, 5708; Mandawar, 7125; Afzalgarh, 7797; Nihtor, 9686; Jahalu, 5547; and Kiratpur, 12,728. The high proportion of their Muhammadan inhabitants may be seen by comparing the statistics for the six towns whose populations exceed 10,000 souls. The following figures give the number of Hindus to each 100 Musalm\u00e1ns in these towns:\u2014Bijnaur, 100.8; Najib\u00e1b\u00e1d, 118; Sherkot, 46; Ch\u00e1ndpur, 47; Nagina, 55; and Kir\u00e1tpur, 52. The only other places of interest in the District are the Rohilla fortress of Pathargarh, a mile north-east of Najib\u00e1b\u00e1d, now fast falling into ruins; and the remains of an ancient city, some 6 miles in extent, at Parasn\u00e1th, near Nagina, where a few foundations and some carved stone figures alone mark the deserted site.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The character of the soil, and the system of tillage in\nBijnaur, do not materially differ from those prevalent throughout the whole upper basin of the Ganges and its tributaries. Here and there, especially in the south-western corner of the District, undulating sand-hills overlie the fertile soil, composed of materials which originally shifted from time to time before the prevailing westerly winds, but which have now become fixed in position and bound together by coarse vegetation. Most of them produce barley and other inferior crops in years of favourable rain. The open plain country is divided into b\u00e1ngar or upland, and kh\u00e1dar or lowland. The latter lies along the riversides; and its soil is always composed of clay, but intermixed with sufficient sand for agricultural purposes. Of the total cultivated area, 36 per cent. is kh\u00e1dar and 64 per cent. b\u00e1ngar. Besides the alluvial border of the Ganges, the rivers M\u00e1lin, Kho, and R\u00e1mgang\u00e1 are all fringed with a fertile strip of valuable lowland. The total area under cultivation amounted in 1880 to 652,689 acres. Of this total (including twice-cropped land), the khar\u00edf or autumn harvest, sown in June or July, and reaped in October or November, occupied some 418,550 acres. The area in acres under the principal khar\u00edf crops was returned as follows:\n\n\u2014Rice, 201,001; bijr\u00e1, 66,702; urd, 24,493; moth, 14,209; cotton, 21,995; sugar-cane, 47,995; together with smaller quantities of oil-seeds, dye-stuffs, and coarse grains. The rab\u00ed or spring harvest (including twice-cropped land), sown in October or November, and reaped in March and April, covered in 1880, 292,692 acres. Its chief crops included wheat, 101,121 acres; barley, 42,155 acres; gram, 25,140 acres; wheat and barley, mixed, 73,960 acres; together with vegetables, opium, tobacco, and safflower, and minor quantities of pulses, oil-seeds, and common food-stuffs. In 1881\u201382, the total cultivated area was returned at 655,085 acres, or, including two-crop (do fasl\u00ed) land, 693,437 acres.\n\nWheat, rice, cotton, and sugar-cane form the most important products. The mode of cultivation is simple, and the implements in use hardly differ from those of the Vedic age. The tenures belong to the three classes common to the whole North-Western Provinces; but the zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri holdings form 79 per cent. of all the estates, whilst among these more than half belong to single owners, chiefly the great t\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs of Sherkot, T\u00e1jpur, Haldaur, and S\u00e1hanpur. The average number of acres cultivated in 1881 by each head of the regular agricultural population (409,453, or 56\u00b775 per cent. of the District population) was 2\u00b764 acres; the amount of Government land revenue, including local cesses levied on the landholders, was \u00a3140,737; the amount of rental, including cesses, paid by the cultivators was \u00a3262,689, or an average of 8s. 0\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. Nearly the whole population are, however, more or less dependent on agriculture, as nearly all the weavers, barbers, blacksmiths, and carpenters cultivate land, and live\nquite as much by tillage as by their proper handicraft. The artisan class are fairly prosperous, judged by an Indian standard, but the purely agricultural labourers are deeply in debt and very helpless. Wages and prices are on the increase. Coolies and unskilled labourers receive from \\(2\\frac{1}{4}\\)d. to \\(3\\frac{3}{4}\\)d. per diem; agricultural hands, from \\(2\\frac{1}{4}\\)d. to 3d.; and skilled artisans, from 6d. to 2s. Women obtain about one-fifth less than men, and children from one-half to one-third the wages of adults. Prices of food-stuffs ruled as follows in 1882: Wheat, \\(17\\frac{3}{4}\\) sers per rupee, or 6s. 5d. per cwt.; rice (best), \\(11\\frac{1}{2}\\) sers per rupee, or 10s. 3d. per cwt.; rice (common), \\(13\\frac{1}{2}\\) sers per rupee, or 8s. 3d. per cwt.; jowar, \\(22\\frac{1}{2}\\) sers per rupee, or 4s. 11d. per cwt.; and bajra, \\(20\\frac{3}{4}\\) sers per rupee, or 5s. 3d. per cwt.\n\n**Natural Calamities.** \u2014 Bijnaur suffers, like other North-Western Districts, from drought and its natural consequence, famine. Indeed, as its dense population depends largely for support upon imported grain, even during the most favourable years, it would be very disastrously affected by dry seasons, were it not for the unusual moisture of the soil, due to its sub-montane position. The great famine of 1783\u201384 was felt in Bijnaur, as in all other parts of the North-Western Provinces, but it did not produce such serious distress as in Agra and the southwest. In 1803\u20134, after the cession of Rohilkhand to the British, another severe famine occurred; failure of rain took place at the time for sowing the autumn crops; no grain could be imported from the westward; and by February 1804 discord was rife, the cultivators removed their crops as fast as they ripened, and the landholders absconded in every direction. In 1825\u201326, serious drought set in, and the resulting scarcity rose to a dangerous pitch, as the zamindars refused to permit sowings, on account of the approaching land settlement. In 1837, again, the memorable famine which desolated the North-West fell upon the neighbouring parts of Upper India with great severity; but Rohilkhand and the Upper Do\u00e1b escaped with less misery than the southern Districts, while a timely rain, in February 1838, rescued Bijnaur and Mor\u00e1d\u00e1b\u00e1d from distress, and enabled them to reap an average crop. In 1860\u201361, only three-tenths of the District suffered; and both in 1868\u201369 and in 1877\u201378, the famine, though felt over the whole area, did not produce any markedly disastrous result. The insufficient communications of this District would doubtless present a real element of danger in any future droughts or famines.\n\n**Commerce and Trade, etc.** \u2014 Sugar is the great commercial staple of the District, the Bijnaur manufacture fetching higher prices in the market than any other Indian brand. On the other hand, the District is incapable of supplying itself with food-stuffs, as much as 24 per cent. of its grain being imported from without in ordinary years. Gram is also largely imported as fodder, while 60,000 maunds of salt come annually\ninto the District from Rohtak and Delhi. The chief manufactures are Br\u00e1hmanical threads (janeo) at Bijnaur; papier-mach\u00e9 at Mand\u00e1war; metal-work, blankets, cotton, and shoes at Naj\u00edb\u00e1b\u00e1d; and carved ebony, glassware, ropes, and firearms at Nag\u00edna. Bijnaur has only 15 miles of metalled road, as no stone suitable for the purpose exists within the District, and even for this short distance the metal must be brought from Muzaffarnagar. There are altogether 615 miles of made roads; but many of these are in a bad state, and no really good means of communication exist. Traffic meets with a serious impediment on its way to the markets of the Do\u00e1b, from the interposition of the Ganges, with its heavy sand, and almost impassable alluvial fringe. The timber trade from the Bh\u00e1bar forests to the Districts beyond the river proceeds by two principal routes over the Jal\u00e1lpur and Raoli gh\u00e1ts. The Ganges is practicable for country boats as far as N\u00e1g\u00e1l, 20 miles south of Hardw\u00e1r, but none of the other rivers admit of navigation.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The District staff ordinarily comprises a Collector-Magistrate, 1 Joint and 1 Assistant Magistrate, and 1 uncovenanted Deputy Magistrate, besides the usual fiscal, constabulary, and medical officers. The criminal jurisdiction is vested in the session judge of Bijnaur and Bud\u00e1un, and the civil jurisdiction in the judge of Mor\u00e1d\u00e1b\u00e1d, to whom in this capacity the sessions judge of Bijnaur and Bud\u00e1un is an \u2018additional\u2019 judge. Muns\u00edfs, or subordinate civil judges, are stationed at Bijnaur and Nag\u00edna. The total amount of District revenue in 1880 was \u00a3138,714, of which \u00a3122,843 was derived from the land. In 1881\u201382, the total imperial, municipal, and local revenue amounted to \u00a3156,500. In 1880\u201381, the regular District police (including municipal and town police) consisted of 657 officers and men, maintained at a total cost of \u00a37315, of which \u00a35825 was charged to provincial revenues and \u00a31490 to local funds. The District jail contained in 1880 a daily average of 219 prisoners, comprising 214 males and 5 females. Education was carried on in 1880 by 128 schools under Government inspection and receiving State aid, with a joint roll of 3991 pupils. This is exclusive of unaided and uninspected schools. The American Methodist Episcopalian Mission maintains some aided schools. The District contains 14 imperial and 8 local post-offices; no telegraph or railway yet exists, but a line now (1883) in course of construction from Mor\u00e1d\u00e1b\u00e1d to Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur will cut through the heart of Bijnaur. For fiscal and administrative purposes Bijnaur is divided into 5 tahsils and 15 pargan\u00e1s, containing a total of 3140 estates; average land revenue from each estate, \u00a337, 19s. rod. Municipalities have been established at the five towns of Bijnaur, Ch\u00e1ndpur, Dh\u00e1mpur, Nag\u00edna, and Naj\u00edb\u00e1b\u00e1d. In 1880\u201381, their joint income amounted to \u00a35173, and their joint expenditure to \u00a34100.\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The chief endemic diseases of Bijnaur comprise intermittent fevers, dysentery, and bowel complaints. Ophthalmia also causes much trouble, and small-pox not unfrequently occurs. The total number of deaths recorded in the year 1880\u201381 was 23,213, or 30'53 per 1000 of the population. The average recorded death-rate for the preceding five years was 34'04 per 1000. During the same year, the District contained 5 charitable dispensaries, at Bijnaur town, Najibabad, Nagina, Sherkot, and Chandpur, in which 58,947 persons received treatment; average daily number of patients, in-door, 30'19; out-door, 364'99. The climate, on the whole, may be considered pleasant and healthy. The average yearly rainfall for the 30 years ending 1881 was 35'79 inches. The maximum during this period was 59'6 inches in 1880\u201381, and the minimum 23'1 inches in 1860\u201361. [For further information regarding Bijnaur, see the Settlement Report of the District by A. M. Markham, Esq., C.S. (1874); the Gazetteer of the North-Western Provinces, vol. v. pp. 238\u2013498, with a Map (Allahabad, 1879); the Census Report of the North-Western Provinces for 1881; and the Administration Reports of those Provinces from 1881 to 1883.]\n\nBijnaur.\u2014Tahsil of Bijnaur District, North-Western Provinces, lying around the head-quarters station. Area, 307'07 square miles, of which 204'7 are cultivated; population (1881) 124,096; land revenue, \u00a321,950; total revenue, \u00a324,355; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a342,640; incidence of Government revenue, 2s. 3d. per acre. In 1883 the Sub-division contained 4 criminal and 4 civil courts, with 3 police stations (tahsils); strength of regular police, including municipal and town police, 103 men; village watchmen (chaukidars) and road police, 299.\n\nBijnaur.\u2014Town and administrative head-quarters of Bijnaur District, North-Western Provinces. Lat. 29\u00b0 22' 36\" N., long. 78\u00b0 10' 32\" E. Population (1881) 15,147, namely, Hindus, 7524; Muhammadans, 7463; Jains, 5; Christians, 144; and 'others,' 11: area of town site, 380 acres. Municipal income in 1880\u201381, \u00a3841; expenditure, \u00a3683. Bijnaur stands on slightly undulating ground about 3 miles from the left bank of the Ganges, whose rich plain it overlooks. It is a neat but unpretending little country town, with more than the usual number of brick-built houses. Through its centre runs a broad main road, the principal place of business, metalled and flanked with good drains. Nine lines of road radiate from the town into the surrounding country. The town is the centre of a large local trade in sugar, for which Bijnaur has a high reputation; manufacture of Brahmanical threads, cotton cloth and knives. Occupied during the Mutiny by the rebel Nawab of Najibabad (see Bijnaur District). Post-office, dispensary, American Methodist Mission. Great bathing fair at Daranagar, on the Ganges, 6 miles south, in November; lasts 5 days, and attracts 40,000 pilgrims.\nBijnaur.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Lucknow District, Oudh; bounded on the north by Lucknow and K\u00e1kori pargan\u00e1s, on the east by those of Mohanl\u00e1lganj and S\u00eds\u00e1ind\u00ed, and on the south and west by Un\u00e1o District. A bare and desolate tract, owing to the extent of uncultivable tracts impregnated with saline efflorescence (\u00fasar). Around the villages, however, the cultivation is very fair, all the ordinary grains and pulses being grown. Area, 148 square miles, of which only 60 are cultivated, and, owing to the reason stated above, probably the limit of cultivation has been reached. The average incidence of the Government land revenue demand is at the rate of 2s. 0\u00bdd. per acre of total area, 3s. 6\u00bed. per acre of assessed area, and 5s. 0\u00bdd. per acre of cultivated area. The average rate of rent paid by ordinary cultivators is about 17s. 9d. per acre, the average size of a husbandman's holding being 3\u00bd acres. Of the 110 villages or towns which make up the pargan\u00e1, nearly one-half are held by Chauh\u00e1n Rajputs, 23 by Br\u00e1hmans, and the remainder by Muhammadans. The total number of separate estates is 111, the chief tenure being zamind\u00e1ri. Population (1881) 60,065, namely, 31,615 males and 28,450 females; average density of population, 405 per square mile. One metalled and two unmetalled roads intersect the pargan\u00e1, as also the Lucknow and Cawnpur Railway, with a station at Har\u00e1uni. Police station at Banthra, with outpost station at Bani bridge on the Sai. Government schools in 6 villages.\n\nBijnaur.\u2014Town in Lucknow District, Oudh; 8 miles south of Lucknow city, with which it is connected by an unmetalled road. Lat. 26\u00b0 56' N., long. 80\u00b0 84' E. Said to have been founded by, and to have taken its name from, Bijl\u00ed R\u00e1j\u00e1, a P\u00e1s\u00ed, who built the great fort of Nathaw\u00e1n, a mile to the north of the town, and was probably driven out by the first Musalm\u00e1n invaders. During Muhammadan rule, the town was the head-quarters from which the pargan\u00e1 of the same name was administered, and a place of considerable trade. At the present day it has sunk into a quiet agricultural village, with a few brick houses, the residences of some of the decayed Musalm\u00e1n gentry. Population (1881) 3370, namely, 2141 Hindus, and 1229 Muhammadans. Once celebrated for its fine cotton cloths, but the manufacture has now greatly fallen off, under the competition of English piece-goods. Government school. Just outside the town on the south are the ruins of the old fort, where the Government officials used to reside; and on the west are extensive remains of brick tombs, built over the Muhammadans who fell at the time of the conquest of the country.\n\nBijn\u00ed.\u2014One of the Eastern Dw\u00e1rs attached to Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 District, Assam. Area, 374'19 square miles; population (1881) 24,882. Area under cultivation, 142'71 square miles; 12'56 square miles have been declared 'forest reserves,' out of a total of 190 square miles proposed as 'protected forest.' The R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bijn\u00ed claims descent from\nthe royal family of Kuch Behar. Besides being the revenue-collector under Government of Bijni Dw\u00e1r, he is also zamind\u00e1r of the two pargan\u00e1s of Khunt\u00e1gh\u00e1t and H\u00e1br\u00e1gh\u00e1t in the permanently settled portion of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 District, with an area of $942\\frac{1}{2}$ square miles. The estate has recently been administered under the Court of Wards during the minority of the R\u00e1j\u00e1. The average annual rental was found to be \u00a312,160, while the Government revenue is only \u00a3235. An accumulated surplus of \u00a379,047 was handed over to the young R\u00e1j\u00e1 when he came of age.\n\n**Bijni.**\u2014Largest village in the Dw\u00e1r of the same name, forming one of the Eastern Dw\u00e1rs attached to Go\u00e1lp\u00e1ra District, Assam; on the north bank of the Dal\u00e1n\u00ed river, which is here crossed by a ferry.

The area according to the Census return of 1881 is $22,340$ square miles; but this can only be an inference, as a large portion is still unsurveyed. Number of villages, 1739, including 6 chief towns. Population (1881) 509,021, namely, Hindus, 436,190; Muhammadans, 50,874; Jains, 21,943; and Christians, 14.\n\nBikaner is bounded on the north-west by Bah\u00e1walpur, a Muhammadan State; on the north-east by the British Districts of Sirsa and Hiss\u00e1r in the Punjab; on the east by Jaipur (Jeypore); on the south and south-west by Jodhpur and Jaisalmir (Jeysulmere). The southern, and most of the north-eastern portions of the State, form part of the vast sandy tract known as the B\u00e1g\u00e1r, comprising also M\u00e1rw\u00e1r and the north of Jaipur. The north-west and part of the north lie within the Thar or Great Indian Desert; the north-east corner, adjoining Sirsa, is the least unfertile section of the State, being in favourable years flooded by the Sotra. The only rocky hills in the State are at the borders of Jaipur and Jodhpur, and even these are not more than 500 feet above the level of the plain. From the city of Bikaner, south-west to the Jaisalmir border, the country is hard and stony; but throughout the greater part of the territory the plain is undulating or interspersed with shifting sandhills from 20 to over 100 feet high, whose slopes, lightly furrowed from the action of the wind, suggest the ribbed appearance of the sea-shore. Generally\nspeaking, the villages are far apart, and though grass and jungle bushes here and there abound, the aspect of the country is dreary and desolate in the extreme. Elphinstone has said that within a short distance of the capital, the country is as waste as the wildest parts of Arabia. Forest does not exist. South of the capital there is a considerable tract covered with brushwood, in which the horses and cattle of the chief are allowed to range, and near some of the towns there are small plantations of the Ber (Zizyphus jujuba). During and just after the rains, the country, however, wears a very different aspect, becoming a vast green pasture-land covered with the richest and most succulent grasses.\n\nThe Bikaner country contains no rivers or streams. In the rainy season, a n\u00e1la sometimes flows from Shaikhaw\u00e1ti over the eastern border, but is soon lost in the sands. The Ghagar, called also the Satra or Hakra in the Punjab, once flowed through the northern part of the present Bikaner territory; but it is now dry, and wells are dug in its bed, where it is said the only sweet water in that region is to be found. During the rains, however, it sometimes contains water for a few miles of its course; and the Tib\u00ed pargan\u00e1 is greatly benefited by it. Some water from the Western Junna Canal occasionally enters the State west of Hiss\u00e1r. Two little fresh-water lakelets, formed by the drainage of the rocky country south-west of Bikaner, lie on the route from Bikaner to Jaisalmir. The first, Gajner, about 20 miles from the capital, has clear water and wooded margin; its palace and garden and fields are a pleasing contrast to the surrounding wilds; the other, 12 miles farther on the route, is a sacred spot, numerous bathing gh\u00e1ts having been built on the banks. The lake of Ch\u00e1par in the Shuj\u00e1ngarh District is the principal source of the salt supply of Bikaner; it is about 6 miles long by 2 miles wide, but it is very shallow, and almost dries up before the hot weather begins. There is another salt lake about 40 miles north-east of Bikaner. The salt produced from these lakes is of inferior quality, valued at about half the price of S\u00e1mbhar salt. It is only consumed by the poor, or used for curing skins and other antiseptic purposes.\n\nWater in Bikaner is found, notwithstanding the slight apparent difference in the level of the country, at very varying depths, and is of very unequal quality. Thus, the city wells are more than 300 feet deep, but the water of most is of excellent quality, while 10 or 12 miles to the north and north-west water is found within 20 feet of the surface; but frequently there is not above 3 feet of sweet water,\u2014an inch too far, and the stratum of pernicious water is tapped, thus spoiling the well for all practical purposes. The people of the country depend a good deal upon rain-water, the drainage of the neighbourhood being collected either in covered pits, called kunds, or in simple\nexcavations (sari). At Nokha, midway between Bikaner and Nagaur, is a well 400 feet deep, and only 3\u00bd feet in diameter at the mouth; water drawn from this well is quite hot. During the hot season the scarcity of water often causes great suffering. Travellers are sometimes found dead on the road for want of it.\n\nBikaner suffers from extremes of heat and cold. During the hot season, the heat is exceedingly great; heavy sandstorms are of frequent occurrence, and the sun is so powerful that even the natives of the country fear to travel in the middle of the day. In winter, the cold is generally very severe, trees and vegetation being injured by the frost. Guinea-worm is very prevalent.\n\nLime is abundant in many parts of the State, especially in the neighbourhood of the city of Bikaner and the town of Shuj\u00e1ngarh. Red sandstone is quarried at Kh\u00e1ri, 30 miles north-east, and is also found in smaller quantities west of Bikaner. The Kh\u00e1ri quarry supplies the building materials used for ornamenting all works of importance in the city. Fuller's earth, quarried in large quantities about 30 miles to the south-west, is used as soap, and for dyeing cloth. Copper was formerly extracted from a hill near Bid\u00e1sir, in the Shuj\u00e1ngarh District, 70 miles east of the city; but the mine has not been worked for many years.\n\nThe staple crops are b\u00e1jr\u00e1 (Holcus spicatus) and moth (Phaseolus aconitifolius). Water-melons and kakris (a coarse kind of melon) are also grown. Bikaner abounds in the best cattle-grasses; indeed, the whole country may be said to be a pasture ground. The domestic animals are finer and more serviceable than those of any other part of India; the horses are strong and wiry; the cattle and buffaloes are equally famous. The State was formerly renowned for its riding camels, but they have deteriorated of late years. The principal manufactures are woollen fabrics, blankets, and sweetmeats; the exports, in addition to these, are wool, soda, fuller's earth, grain, leathern water-bags, and ivory bracelets ornamented with gold, which are in great demand throughout R\u00e1jput\u00e1na.\n\nThe population of the State was estimated by Major Powlett in 1874 as not less than 300,000. The Census of 1881 returned the total at 509,021, of whom 293,650 were males and 215,371 females, occupying 107,569 houses; or 22\u00b778 persons per square mile of area, and 4\u00b773 persons per occupied house. According to religion there were, Hindus, 436,190; Muhammadans, 50,874; Jains, 21,943; and Christians, 14. The number of villages is said to be 1739, but villages in Bikaner are so frequently abandoned and repopulated, that the number existing at any given time can, it is feared, never be precisely ascertained. The most numerous castes are J\u00e1ts, who are almost all agriculturists; Baniy\u00e1s or traders number\n49,907, some of whom cultivate the soil; R\u00e1jputs, 41,696, three-fourths of the number being cultivators; and Br\u00e1hmans, 55,816, also mostly cultivators. Spare land being very plentiful, the holdings are large, and there is no struggle for shares, as in adjoining British territory. The proprietary right in land throughout Bikaner belongs, as a rule, to the State. The cultivator's right of occupancy is supposed to depend on his ability to meet the State demands. The yearly revenues of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 amount to about \u00a3125,000, collected in the form of land-tax, customs, fines, civil court fees, and minor items. The following are the Districts and chief towns of the State:\u2014In the north, Tibi, An\u00fapgarh, Sard\u00e1rgarh, Suratgarh, and Hanum\u00e1ngarh; in the north-east, Nohar and Bah\u00e1dr\u00e1n; in the east, R\u00e1jgarh and Ch\u00far\u00fa; in the south-east, Shuj\u00e1ngarh and Ratangarh; and Pugal in the west. Other large towns are Reni, Sard\u00e1r Shir, Deshnuk, Kol\u00e1th, Bidesar, and Bhatnair.\n\nThe ruling family of Bikaner is of the R\u00e1htor clan of R\u00e1jputs. The State was founded by Bika, born in 1439, the sixth son of Jodha R\u00e1o of M\u00e1rw\u00e1r, the founder of Jodhpur. The first contact of the British Government with Bikaner State occurred in 1808, when Mr. Elphinstone, the British Envoy, passing through on his way towards K\u00e1bul, was treated with great respect by the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1, S\u00farat Singh. In 1818, the country being overrun by the Pind\u00e1ris, supported by rebellious nobles, British troops, in accordance with a treaty then made, entered the territory and suppressed the insurgents. Twelve forts in all were taken by the British, and handed over to the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1. S\u00farat Singh died in 1828, and was succeeded by Ratan Singh. In the first Sikh war (1845), Bikaner troops marched in conjunction with British forces towards Firozpur (Ferozepore); and during the second Sikh campaign (1848), a small body of horse and artillery were placed at the disposal of the British, and camels and stores were collected; but it was found that the route through Bikaner could not be advantageously used by troops, owing to want of water and supplies. During the Mutiny, the Bikaner chief, Sirdar Singh, furnished a force to co-operate with General Courtland against the mutineers of Sirsa, H\u00e1nsi, and Hiss\u00e1r. In recognition of these services, the British Government bestowed 41 villages on the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1, in addition to the right of adoption. The present chief is an adopted son. He is entitled to a salute of 17 guns. Bikaner contributes to no local corps or contingents; it maintains a force of 960 cavalry, 180 artillerymen, 1700 infantry, 24 field and 56 other guns. [For further information regarding Bikaner State, see the Rajputana Gazetteer, vol. i. pp. 179-202 (Calcutta, 1879).]\n\nBikaner (Bickaneer).\u2014The capital of the R\u00e1jput State of the same name, founded in 1438 by Bika, sixth son of Jodha R\u00e1o of M\u00e1rw\u00e1r;\nsituated on a slight elevation amid a scene of singular dreariness, the soil being stony and totally unfit for cultivation. Viewed from some points, it presents the appearance of a great city, having a fine wall surmounted by round towers, and crowned with battlements. So imposing is its appearance, that, when approached in 1808 by Elphinstone's mission, there were disputes among his followers whether it was not more extensive than Delhi. Some high houses and temples rising above the ramparts, and the striking outline of the lofty fort, add to the impressive appearance of the place. The wall, $3\\frac{1}{2}$ miles in circuit, is built wholly of stone, and has five gates and three sally-ports. It is 6 feet thick, and from 15 to 30 feet high, including a parapet 6 feet high and 2 feet thick, the breadth of the terre-plain varying from 2 to 4 feet. There is a ditch on three sides only, the ground on the southern face being intersected by deep ravines, which have broken up the whole plain in that quarter. As the soil is kankar, or calcareous conglomerate intermingled with silicious pebbles, the sides of the ditch, though not lined with masonry, are nearly perpendicular. The depth is about 15 feet, the breadth 20 feet, the interval between the wall and the ditch from 20 to 30 yards; but in some places the excavation has been quite filled up. In the interior are many good houses, faced with red sandstone richly carved. Dr. Moore, who was superintending surgeon, observes that carved buildings are more numerous in Bikaner than in any of the Rajput capitals. This tracery is called khuda or manbat. But the houses are situated in narrow, dirty lanes, where they can scarcely be seen. The poorer kind are besmeared with a sort of reddish clay, abundant in the ravines near the city, which gives the place an appearance of neatness and uniformity, the walls being all red, and the doors and windows white. Distinct wards or sub-divisions are allotted to the respective trades and crafts.\n\nDr. Moore remarks, regarding the interior of the city, that to the north and the north-east within the walls, there are large open spaces not yet built over, or with only small houses here and there. Penetrating farther, the more densely populated portion of the town is reached; and this, from the extreme irregularity of the streets, lanes, and spaces, defies any clear description. None of the capitals or large provincial towns of Rajputana can vie with Bikaner as regards the grotesque irregularity of its thoroughfares. The population of the city and its suburbs was returned in 1881 at 43,283, of whom 21,409 are males and 21,874 females; the Hindus number 31,602; Muhammadans, 7354; 'others,' 4327: the number of houses within the city in 1874, 7331, with 1470 in the suburbs. Of these, 1015 were of masonry. The total number of shops was 741; temples, 13; mosques, 14. The most numerous classes are the Baniyas, chiefly Oswals and Mahesris, whose united numbers amount to 10,000; and the Br\u00e1hmans,\nwho exceed 7000, the great majority being Pokarna. The only other class which number over 1000 are the Sewaks, or servants of the various temples. The total number of wells is 41, of which in the city 5 are sweet, in the suburbs 22, in the fort 4, the remainder being brackish.\n\nOutside the city stands the Alak S\u00e1gar Well, built by the Alakg\u00edr sect. It is the finest well in the State, and water is constantly being drawn from four sides. Water at Bikaner is only obtainable 300 or 400 feet below the surface. Dr. Moore investigated the material brought up from a well where water had been reached at a depth of 316 feet. The strata passed through were\u2014first, a mass of kankar; then red clay; thirdly, sandstone; and lastly, white gritty sand or gravel,\u2014the latter consisting of white stones from the size of a pea to that of an egg, composed of quartz, and although not round, yet with surfaces and angles so smooth as to give rise to the idea that they must at some time have been exposed to the action of running water. The water of Bikaner, though not plentiful, is generally excellent in quality. It is somewhat hard from excess of lime, and when drawn from the wells often has a temperature of 85\u00b0 F. To protect it from organic impurities, a stone covering is usually put over the mouths of wells, and the water is conveyed to the city in large ghar\u00e1s or earthen jars instead of the common leathern masaks. The people of Bikaner are exceedingly dirty both in their persons and habits; but as they do not wash in or on the brink of wells, the supply of drinking water is not contaminated. In other respects the sanitary condition of the city is very bad.\n\nThere are several schools in the State for teaching reading, writing, and arithmetic in Hindi. In 1881 the D\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1r gave sites for two buildings, which have since been completed. These schools are to be branches of the D\u00fangar Singh College, named after the present M\u00e1har\u00e1ja, in which English, Hind\u00ed, and eventually Urdu will be taught. The large subscriptions for this college from the chief nobles and mercantile community will, it is hoped, make the college a permanent institution. There are seven Jain monasteries (up\u00e1sar\u00e1s), which possess many Sanskrit manuscripts. Bikaner is famous for the manufacture of a white variety of sugar-candy, and of fine woollen blankets. There are also a large number of potters, stone-cutters, and carvers among the population. The fort of Bikaner, which contains the R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s palace, is situated about 300 yards from the Kot gate of the city. The buildings towering above the battlements present an imposing appearance. The palace is 1078 yards in circuit, with two entrances, each of which has three or four successive gates with different names; and its rampart is strengthened by numerous bastions about 40 feet high, and a moat running all round in a direction parallel to the curtains without following the course of the bastions. This moat is 30 feet wide at the\ntop, but narrow at the bottom, and 20 or 25 feet deep. The fort was built in Samvat 1645 by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Rai Singh. It has been besieged several times, but is said to have been never taken. The palace buildings are the composite work of a long series of R\u00e1j\u00e1s, nearly every one of whom has contributed something. The elephants and horses, as is usual in a R\u00e1jput fort, are stabled just under the palace windows. The old fort, built by B\u00edka, is picturesquely situated on high rocky ground, surrounded by ravines, outside the southern wall of the city. It is small, and now more a shrine than a fort. Within it are the cenotaphs of B\u00edka and his successors, with some persons of less note. The cremation tank of Bikaner, used since the time of Jat Singh, the grandson of B\u00edka, is situated 3 miles east of the city. On each side of this tank are ranged the cenotaphs of twelve chiefs, from Kali\u00e1n Sinh to Rat\u00e1n Singh. Several of them are fine buildings, and all have graceful pillared domes. The material is the red sandstone of Kh\u00e1r\u00ed, and Makr\u00e1ni marble, on which is sculptured a bas-relief with the mounted figure of the chief; on foot, standing in order of precedence before him, the wives; and behind and below him, the concubines who mounted his funeral pile. The date, names of the dead, and in some cases a verse of Sanskrit besides, are inscribed. The latest distinguished sati in Bikaner was an Udaipur princess named D\u00edp Kunwar, wife of R\u00e1j\u00e1 S\u00farat Singh\u2019s second son, Moti Singh, who died in 1825 A.D. Not far from the tank is a palace for the convenience of the chief and his ladies when they have occasion to attend ceremonies at Dev\u00ed K\u00fand. The whole zan\u00e1na sometimes comes in procession to worship at Dev\u00ed K\u00fand, where, too, the tonsure of the chief\u2019s sons takes place. The city of Bikaner is in lat. 28\u00b0 N., long. 73\u00b0 22\u2019 E.\n\n**Bikapur.**\u2014Tahsil or Sub-division in Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d (Fyz\u00e1b\u00e1d) District, Oudh; bounded on the north by Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d tahsil, on the east by Akbarpur tahsil, on the south by Sult\u00e1npur and Mus\u00e1firkh\u00e1na tahsils of Sult\u00e1npur, and on the west by R\u00e1m Sanehi tahsil of Bara Banki; lying between 26\u00b0 24\u2019 30\u201d and 26\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201d N. lat., and between 81\u00b0 43\u2019 and 82\u00b0 23\u2019 E. long. Area, 466 square miles, of which 262 are cultivated; population, according to the Census of 1881, 248,651 Hindus, 17,364 Muhammadans\u2014total, 266,015, namely, 131,513 males and 134,502 females; number of villages or townships, 630; average density of population, 571 per square mile. The tahsil consists of the 2 pargan\u00e1s of Pachhimr\u00e1th and Jagd\u00edspur-Khand\u00e1nsa.\n\n**Bikapur.**\u2014Village in Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Oudh, and head-quarters of Bikapur tahsil, situated on the metalled road from Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d to Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d. Population (1881) 331. Tahsili, police station, village school, staging bungalow, and sarai.\n\n**Bikkavolu.**\u2014Village in God\u00e1var\u00ed District, Madras Presidency.\nPopulation (1881) 2397, inhabiting 512 houses. Lat. 16\u00b0 58' N., long. 82\u00b0 6' E.; situated on the northern edge of the delta, on a main canal 16 miles west of Coconada.\u2014See Birudanka-Rayapuram.\n\n**Bikrampur.**\u2014Village in Dacca District, Bengal; celebrated as being the seat of government under the Hindu kings of Northern Bengal, from the reign of Vikramaditya to the overthrow of the dynasty by the Musalmans. Lat. 23\u00b0 33' N., long. 90\u00b0 33' 30\" E. A quadrangular mound of earth, covering an area of 3000 square feet, and surrounded by a moat 200 feet wide, is pointed out as the site of Raja Ballal Sen's palace, and the foundations and remains of buildings are found for many miles round. Near the site of the palace is a deep excavation, called Agnikunda, where, according to legend, the last native prince of Bikrampur and his family burned themselves on the approach of the Musalmans. The village ranks only second to Nadiya town as regards Sanskrit learning, and contains several tols (see Nadiya District), where logic, rhetoric, grammar, and astronomy are taught. The pargana to which the village gives its name, and which extends over the two police divisions of Munshiganj and Srinagar, supplies nearly one-third of the subordinate native officials in the Government offices of Bengal.\n\n**Bil\u00e1igarh.**\u2014Chiefship or zamindari in Bilaspur District, Central Provinces. Area, 109 square miles, or 69,760 acres, of which only 10,977 acres are cultivated, and about 20,000 acres more are cultivable; number of villages, 54; occupied houses, 2476; population (1881) 10,848, namely, males 5419, and females 5429; average density of population, 99'52 per square mile. The ruins of a large fort and of some ancient temples show that the hamlet of the same name (lat. 21\u00b0 38' 15\" N., long. 82\u00b0 46' E.), where the Chief resides, was once a place of some importance. The Chief is of Gond descent.\n\n**Bil\u00e1ri.**\u2014Tahsil of Moradabad District, North-Western Provinces. Area, 333 square miles, of which 257 are cultivated; population (1881) 229,784; number of villages, 394; land revenue, \u00a333,310; total revenue, \u00a335,549; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a366,880; incidence of Government revenue, 2s. 9d. per acre. The tahsil contains 1 civil and 2 criminal courts, with 2 police stations (thana); strength of regular police, including municipal police, 64 men; village watchmen (chaukidars), 472.\n\n**Bil\u00e1ri.**\u2014Town in Moradabad District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of Bilari tahsil, situated 16 miles south-east of Moradabad town. Population (1881) 4861, namely, 2486 Hindus, and 2375 Musalmans; town area, 65 acres. A small revenue is raised under the provisions of Act xx. of 1865, for police and conservancy purposes, amounting to \u00a3120 in 1881-82. Railway and telegraph station on the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway.\n\n**Bil\u00e1spur.**\u2014District in the Chief Commissionership of the Central\nProvinces, lying between $21^\\circ 22'$ and $23^\\circ 6'$ N. lat., and between $80^\\circ 48'$ and $83^\\circ 10'$ E. long. Bounded on the north by the Native State of Rew\u00e1, on the east by the Garhj\u00e1t States of Chutia N\u00e1gpur and the chiefships of Sambalpur District; on the south by R\u00e1ipur; and on the west by the Districts of Mandl\u00e1 and B\u00e1lg\u00e1h\u00e1t. Population (1881) 1,017,327; area, 7798 square miles. The administrative head-quarters of the District are at Bil\u00e1spur, which is also the principal town.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District resembles a vast amphitheatre, opening on the south upon the plains of R\u00e1ipur, but on every other side surrounded by tiers of hills. These irregular chains, though known in each locality by a special name, form in truth a part of the great Vindhy\u00e1n sandstone range, which extends from east to west across the whole peninsula of India. In Bil\u00e1spur, the hills on the northern side constitute the most important series. They run along the whole length of the plain,\u2014here thrusting forth an arm or throwing up an isolated peak, or advancing boldly into the level country, there receding into deep hollows and recesses, usually covered with luxuriant vegetation. From the solitary cliff of Dahl\u00e1, 2600 feet high, standing out in the plain about 15 miles east of Bil\u00e1spur, the features of the country can be best descried. On the one side, a great expanse of plain stretches away as far as the eye can reach; on the other, rise irregular ranges of hills, which throw a dark shadow on the green surface below. From this height, the spectator can easily discern the villages which dot the landscape, the numerous tanks sparkling in the sun, and the mango, pip\u00e1l, and tamarind groves which break the monotony of the generally shadeless plain. Examined more closely, the vast plateau breaks up into a series of undulations; sometimes a long stretch or sandy or stony upland, then an expanse of low-lying rice fields, and again abrupter alternations, deeply cleft by many a fissure or ravine. But the grander scenery of Bil\u00e1spur must be sought in the hilly country occupied by tracts of Government waste, and by fifteen chiefships, in two of which, Sakti and Kaw\u00e1rda, the chiefs have been acknowledged as feudatories. In these highlands, the scanty villages convey no impression of permanence, but are mere solitary breaks in a vast mountain wilderness. In M\u00e1tin and Uprora lies perhaps the wildest country in Chhat\u00edsgarh. Here it is that the shattered forest trees, the broken and crushed bamboo clumps, the hollows and footprints in a hundred marshes and watercourses, indicate the presence of wild elephants. Sometimes, when the rice crop is ripening, a herd will wander from a neighbouring chiefship, and in a single night destroy the toil of months; but in M\u00e1tin and Uprora, elephants are never absent, and may be seen on the wooded slopes of the Hasdu river, in the shady depths of the forest, near some waterfall or deep still pool in the bed of the mountain torrent.\nThe Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed, though it only flows for about twenty-five miles along the south-eastern extremity of the District, forms the centre of the drainage system of Bil\u00e1spur. A magnificent river during the rains, attaining in places a breadth of two miles, the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed in the hot season dwindles down to a narrow stream creeping through a vast expanse of sand, which may almost anywhere be forded with ease. Most of the waters of the District flow from the northern and western hills; but these ranges constitute a distinct watershed, and give birth to other streams, which, flowing north and west, and leaving Bil\u00e1spur behind them, by degrees assume the dignity of rivers. Such are the Son (Soane), which rises in a marshy hollow in Pendr\u00e1, and the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda), rushing picturesquely over the rocky heights of Amarkantak. The District contains extensive forests, most of which, however, are zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1ri, or private property. The only large tracts of Government forest are the wastes spreading over the Lorm\u00ed and Lamn\u00ed hills in the north-west, and the Son\u00e1kh\u00e1n area to the south-east, the total area of the former being 190,269 acres, and of the latter, 97,503.\n\nHistory.\u2014Until the invasion of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, Bil\u00e1spur was governed by the Haihai Bans\u00ed kings of Ratanpur, whose annals are lost in the mist of antiquity. The dealings of Krishna with May\u00far Dw\u00e1ja, the earliest recorded prince of the line, are related in the Jaimini Pur\u00e1na (Jaiminiya Aswamedha). The god, disguised as a Br\u00e1hman, asked for half of May\u00far Dw\u00e1ja\u2019s body to test his faith. The king consented to be cut in two with a saw; but when all was ready, Krishna revealed himself, and showered blessings on the head of the pious prince. From this time until the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 invasion, no man used the saw throughout the land. The R\u00e1j\u00e1s at Ratanpur ruled originally over 36 forts, and hence the tract was called Chhat\u00edsgarh, or \u2018the place of 36 forts.\u2019 But on the accession of the twentieth R\u00e1j\u00e1, Surdev\u00e1, about 750 A.D., Chhat\u00edsgarh was divided into two sections; and while Surdev\u00e1 continued to govern the northern half from Ratanpur, his younger brother, Brahmadev\u00e1, moved to R\u00e1ipur and held the southern portion. From this time two separate R\u00e1j\u00e1s ruled in Chhat\u00edsgarh; for though nine generations later the direct line from Brahmadev\u00e1 became extinct, a younger son from the Ratanpur house again proceeded to R\u00e1ipur, whose issue continued in power till the advent of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. The 36 forts were in reality each the head-quarters of a t\u00e1luk, comprising a number of villages, held sometimes kh\u00e1m, and sometimes as feudal tenures, by relations or influential chiefs. Of the 18 divisions retained by Surdev\u00e1, as compared with the present Bil\u00e1spur District, 11 are kh\u00e1ls\u00ed jurisdictions, and 7 are zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1ris, while the 18th karkat\u00ed appears to have been made over to Rew\u00e1 by R\u00e1j\u00e1 D\u00e1d\u00fa R\u00e1i about 1480, as a dowry to his daughter. Of other tracts now included in Bil\u00e1spur, Pandaria and Kaward\u00e1 on the west, were\nwrested from the Gond dynasty of Mandl\u00e1; Korba from Sarguj\u00e1 about 1520; and the small chiefship of Bil\u00e1igarh, south of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed, with the kh\u00e1l\u00e1s\u00e1 tract of Kikarda, on the east, from Sam-balpur about 1580.\n\nSurdev\u00e1 was succeeded by his son Prithwid\u00e9v\u00e1, of whose deeds local tradition is full; and the sculptured tablets of Malh\u00e1r and Amarkantak still record, in Sanskrit verse, how he was a terror to his enemies, a friend to his people, generous to the learned, and himself fond of learning. After Prithwid\u00e9v\u00e1 followed a long line of R\u00e1j\u00e1s, whose names are commemorated on temple slabs, associated now with the building of a shrine, now with the construction of a tank; but it was not till the reign of Kaly\u00e1n Sah\u00ed, between 1536 and 1573, that this landlocked region came into contact with the outer world. That prince, leaving the government in his son\u2019s hands, proceeded to Delhi to have audience of the great Akbar, and, after eight years\u2019 absence, returned to Ratanpur invested with the full rights of R\u00e1j\u00e1 and a high-sounding title. The prudent submission of Kaly\u00e1n Sah\u00ed helped to prolong the independence of his dynasty, and, after nine further successions, a R\u00e1j\u00e1 of the Haihai Bans\u00ed line still ruled in Bil\u00e1spur. But R\u00e1j Singh had no child. At the same time he had no wish that his nearest heir, his great-uncle Sard\u00e1r Singh, should succeed him. Accordingly the R\u00e1j\u00e1 took counsel of his Br\u00e1hman d\u00edv\u00e1n, a hereditary servant of the family. After much discussion, and an appeal to the sacred books, it was resolved that a Br\u00e1hman selected by the d\u00edv\u00e1n should visit the favourite R\u00e1n\u00ed. In due time she gave birth to a son, who received the name of B\u00edsn\u00e1th Singh; and the popular rejoicings knew no bounds.\n\nWhen B\u00edsn\u00e1th Singh reached a proper age, he was married to a daughter of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Rew\u00e1. Soon after the wedding the young couple were playing a game of chance, when B\u00edsn\u00e1th Singh tried his bride\u2019s temper by defeating her game after game. At length she discovered that he was playing unfairly, and rising from the table she said, half in jest and half in scorn, \u2018Of course I should expect to be overreached, for are you not a Br\u00e1hman, and no R\u00e1jput!\u2019 Stung to the soul with the taunt, confirming as it did whispers which had already reached him, the young prince went hurriedly out and stabbed himself to the heart. When R\u00e1j Singh heard what had happened, he resolved to revenge himself on his d\u00edv\u00e1n, through whose imprudence or treachery the shame of the royal house had been revealed. The D\u00edv\u00e1n P\u00e1r\u00e1, or \u2018Minister\u2019s Square,\u2019 of Ratanpur at that time formed an imposing part of the town. There lived the d\u00edv\u00e1n, and round him a crowd of relations who, however distantly connected, had congregated near the fortunate representative of the family. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 blew down with cannon the whole of this quarter, involving in one common ruin\nevery member of the small community, to the number of over 400 men women, and children. With the div\u00e1n, most of the records of the dynasty perished.\n\nAfter these occurrences Mohan Singh, of the R\u00e1ipur house, a vigorous and attractive young man, was generally regarded as the R\u00e1j\u00e1's destined successor. But Mohan Singh chanced to be away on a hunting expedition, when R\u00e1j Singh was thrown violently from his horse. Finding himself near death, and the young man not appearing, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 placed the pagri on the head of Sard\u00e1r Singh. A few days after R\u00e1j Singh's death, Mohan Singh arrived, but only to find Sard\u00e1r Singh duly installed. In a fit of rage he departed, muttering that he would yet return and assume the government. Sard\u00e1r Singh, however, ruled quietly for twenty years, and was succeeded, in 1732, by his brother Raghun\u00e1th Singh, a man over sixty years old. Eight years later the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 general, Bh\u00e1skar Panth, invaded Bil\u00e1spur with an army of 40,000 men. At that time Raghun\u00e1th Singh was bowed down by a heavy sorrow, having lately lost his only son. The heart-broken old man made no attempt to defend himself, and gave no sign till part of his palace was already in ruins from the enemy's fire. Then one of the R\u00e1n\u00eds mounted the parapet and exhibited a flag of truce. Thus ingloriously ended the rule of the Haihai Bans\u00ed dynasty. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, after exacting a heavy fine and pillaging the country, permitted the fallen R\u00e1j\u00e1 to carry on the government in the name of the Bhonslas. Meantime Mohan Singh had become a favourite of Raghuji Bhonsla; and on the death of Raghun\u00e1th Singh, the ambition of his youth was gratified by his installation as R\u00e1j\u00e1. In 1758, Bimb\u00e1ji Bhonsla succeeded, and ruled at Ratanpur for nearly thirty years; and when he died, his widow, Anandi B\u00e1\u00ed, held the real authority till about 1800.\n\nFrom this time till the deposition of Ap\u00e1 S\u00e1hib by the British in 1818, a succession of subahd\u00e1rs misgoverned Bil\u00e1spur. The occupation of the District by a Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 army, the raids of the Pind\u00e1r\u00eds, and the exactions of the subahd\u00e1rs or deputies, had half ruined the country, when it was placed under Colonel Agnew's superintendence. From this date it has begun to improve. In 1830 the last Raghuji came of age, and ruled from that time until his death. On the lapse of the N\u00e1gpur Province to the British Government in 1854, Chhat\u00edsgarh was formed into a separate Deputy Commissionership with head-quarters at R\u00e1ipur; but the charge proved too heavy for a single officer, and finally, in 1861, Bil\u00e1spur was constituted a separate District, comprising, with the additions subsequently made, the northern section of the Chhat\u00edsgarh country. During the Mutiny, no disturbance occurred except at Son\u00e1kh\u00e1n, a small estate among the hills at the south-eastern corner of the District, the zam\u00ednd\u00e1r of which, breaking out from R\u00e1ipur jail, where he was confined on a charge of dacoity with murder, returned\nto his fastnesses and openly defied authority. Captain Lucie-Smith, however, at once proceeded to the spot, and the zamind\u00e1r unconditionally surrendered. His execution, and the confiscation of his property, effectually checked any further opposition, which in so wild a country might have proved most harassing.\n\n**Population.**\u2014In 1872, Bil\u00e1spur District, with an area of 7798 square miles, contained a population returned by the Census of that year at 715,398. By 1881, the population, on the same area, had risen to 1,017,327, or an increase of 301,929 (42\u00b72 per cent.) in the nine years. This increase, however, is much more apparent than real, owing to very defective enumeration in 1872, particularly in the zamind\u00e1ri part of the District, where the work was left almost entirely in the hands of the zamind\u00e1rs. The population of the District in 1881 (1,017,327) was distributed throughout 3724 towns and villages; number of houses, 290,299, of which 281,580 were inhabited and 8719 unoccupied; average density of population, 130\u00b75 per square mile; inmates per occupied house, 3\u00b761. Divided according to sex, there were\u2014males 504,046, and females 513,281; proportion of males in total population, 49\u00b76 per cent. According to religious classification, orthodox Hindus numbered 629,659; Kab\u00edrpanth\u00eds, 87,348; Satn\u00e1m\u00eds, 133,086; Muhammadans, 9625; Sikhs, 10; Christians, 35; Jains, 17; aboriginal tribes, 157,547. The most numerous of the aboriginal tribes is the Gonds, 123,928 in 1881, of whom 8811 were returned as Hindus, the remainder consisting of Bhari\u00e1s, Mari\u00e1s, Kurk\u00fas, Baig\u00e1s, etc. Among the Hindus, Br\u00e1hmans numbered in 1881, 23,224; R\u00e1jputs, 15,928; K\u00farm\u00eds, 41,327; Tel\u00eds, 61,324; Ah\u00edrs or Gaul\u00eds, 84,546; Cham\u00e1rs, 95,020; Mar\u00e1rs, 24,541; Dhob\u00eds, 15,178; and Kewats, 34,767. As regards the occupations of the people, the Census of 1881 classifies the male population into the following six main divisions:\u2014(1) Professional class, including Government officials and the learned professions, 6715; (2) domestic servants, etc., 2724; (3) commercial class, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 3215; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 242,562; (5) manufacturing, artisan, and other industrial classes, 29,551; (6) indefinite and non-productive (comprising 8056 labourers and 211,223 unspecified, including children), 219,279.\n\nA cloth of scanty dimensions forms the sole dress of a cultivator, and a cloth of larger size satisfies all the requirements of fashion for the women. It is tightened at the waist; and, while half hangs loosely down to the knee, the other half is spread over the breast, and drawn across the right shoulder. For ornaments, a man will adopt a gold or silver bracelet, or small ear-rings, or pride himself on a silver waist-band; few, except young Gond ladies, wear toe-rings or anklets. All classes habitually take three meals a day\u2014rice and d\u00e1l at noon, rice\nand vegetables cooked with gh\u00ed in the evening, and in the morning, before beginning work, a rice gruel called b\u00e1si, which consists simply of the remains of the last evening's repast filled up with water and served cold. The castes who eat fish and flesh have of course a greater variety of diet; and the abundance of milk and g\u00far enables a clever matron to provide occasional sweets. On the whole, the great body of the people live well; but their simplicity and superstition render them an easy prey to designing persons. An instance may be mentioned. About twenty years ago a Pank\u00e1, named Mangal, gave out that a deity had entered into him; and, sitting with a light before him, he received the adoration and offerings of crowds of worshippers. It happened to be the cultivating season, and Mangal proclaimed that good men's crops would spring up without sowing. Thousands believed his teaching, till, finding the revenue falling off, the Native Government arrested Mangal, and committed him to R\u00e1ipur jail. The language spoken in the District is corrupt Hind\u00ed, with an admixture of aboriginal words. The largest towns in the District are\u2014BILASPUR (population, 7775), RATANPUR (5615), and MUNGEI (4757); 84 other towns have a population exceeding 1000. Townships of from 200 to 1000 inhabitants, 1720; villages of fewer than 200 inhabitants, 1917. The only municipality is Bil\u00e1sipur.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Of the total area of 7798 square miles, 2121 were returned in 1881 as under cultivation, 4164 square miles as cultivable, and 1063 square miles as uncultivable waste. About one-fifth of the area under cultivation is irrigated, entirely by private enterprise. Rice forms the staple crop of the District, occupying in 1881, 751,529 acres, the other principal crops being\u2014wheat, 537,470 acres; other food-grains, 291,680 acres; oil-seeds, 112,500 acres; sugar-cane, 13,843 acres; cotton, 33,070 acres; fibres, 2763 acres; tobacco, 4345 acres; and vegetables, 4031 acres. These figures include land bearing two crops in the year. Either the black earth, consisting of the d\u00e9bris of trap, or the red, which is probably decomposed laterite, is most suitable for rice; but the situation and aspect of the rice fields, which are excessively small, are considered of more importance than the nature of the soil. Sugar-cane and garden produce grow well on the sandy patches. It is only for these crops that irrigation is resorted to and manure used. Where rice is grown, rotation of crops is not practised, nor is the land allowed to remain fallow. The yield of new land averages 25 to 30 per cent. extra, till in four or five years it falls to the common level. With other crops rotation is in use. Thus, after wheat will come gram or mas\u00far, and then perhaps kodo. Cotton is often succeeded by til or some other oil-seed; and where this is not done, after four or five years the land is left fallow. The cultivation of cotton continues to increase, having nearly doubled within the last few years. The Census of 1881\nshowed a total of 9098 proprietors. The tenants of all grades numbered 315,872, of whom 61,817 had either absolute or occupancy rights, 148,852 were tenants-at-will, and 105,203 assistants in home cultivation. The agricultural labourers numbered 78,257. The average area cultivated in 1881 by each head of the regular agricultural population (495,067, or 39\u00b782 per cent. of the District population) was 7 acres; the amount of Government land revenue and local cesses levied on the landholders was \u00a328,643; and the amount of rental, including cesses, paid by the cultivators was \u00a361,049.\n\nThe rent of land suited for rice averages 11d.; for wheat, 1s. 2d.; for cotton or oil-seeds, 9d.; for sugar-cane, 3s. 6d. Average produce per acre\u2014rice, 424 lbs.; wheat, 324 lbs.; cotton, 54 lbs.; and oil-seeds, 120 lbs. The price of rice at the end of 1881-82 was 2s. per cwt.; wheat, 2s. 4d. per cwt.; and raw sugar (gur), 11s. per cwt. Wages average for skilled labour 1s. per diem, for unskilled 3d. The agricultural stock is thus returned\u2014cows, bullocks, and buffaloes, 655,640; horses, 354; ponies, 4691; donkeys, 104; sheep and goats, 21,235; pigs, 4861; carts, 13,647; and ploughs, 287,202. The extensive forests of the District are situated in the zamindaris, and belong to private proprietors; the only large tracts of Government forest consist of the wastes which spread over the Lormi and Lamni Hills on the north-west, and the confiscated area at Sonakh\u00e1n. On the plain skirting the northern hills, other patches of jungle have been reserved. Sil is the only valuable timber, and the inaccessibility of the forests renders the revenue from this source of small value. Of jungle products, lac and tasar silk are the most important. In some villages the practice prevails of changing fields periodically, to prevent any monopoly of the best sites. Everywhere throughout the District the husbandmen show but slight attachment to their individual holdings; even a hereditary tenant will, for a small sum, relinquish his land.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014An agricultural population, dependent for its subsistence on a single crop, and that one which requires a heavy downpour in each of the four rainy months, would appear peculiarly exposed to famine. Happily, however, owing to its girdle of hills, Bilaspur enjoys a fairly regular monsoon, and an abundant fall in one part generally compensates for drought in another. Moreover, the numerous tanks, though of small size, add considerably to the water supply of the District.\n\nCommerce and Trade.\u2014The weaving trade constitutes the only important local industry. In 1870, it employed about 6000 looms, turning out at least 600,000 cloths, of the value of \u00a360,000. Besides the regular weavers, the Pank\u00e1 caste work at the loom as well as in the fields, and nearly half the cloth in the District is made by them. Ironore abounds in the hilly regions; but owing to the absence of agarias\nor smelters, the manufacture does not extend beyond a few villages. Near Korba on the right bank of the Hasdu, and in the beds of two hill streams, the Bij\u00e1kher\u00e1 and Mundjh\u00e1ria, and probably in other parts, coal exists in considerable quantities. It is shaly and inferior on the surface, and whether the lower seams will prove of better quality has not yet been ascertained. The District offers at many points sandstone excellently suited for building purposes, but the only important quarries are those near Bil\u00e1spur and Seorin\u00e1r\u00e1yan. The weekly markets, of which at least 170 are held throughout the District, supply the means of internal trade. They are held either in a shady mango grove, or, more frequently, in some open space near a village. At the large b\u00e1z\u00e1rs at B\u00e1mind\u00ed, Gani\u00e1ri, Takhtpur, and Mungeli, a brisk traffic in cattle is carried on. The chief imports of the District are sugar, metals, English piece-goods, and cattle, while the exports consist entirely of agricultural produce\u2014rice, wheat, gram, and lac. The whole trade tends in a westerly direction, to the railway at Jabalpur (Jubbulpore). In that direction the Banj\u00e1r\u00e1s drive their long lines of pack-bullocks along a track winding over hill and valley, and across the steep and craggy beds of numerous streams. The northern routes through Pendra to Rew\u00e1, and through Upr\u00f3r\u00e1 to Mirz\u00e1pur, pass over a difficult country, and are only available for pack-bullocks during six months in the year. Though no made roads yet exist in Bil\u00e1spur, the abundance of gravel would render their construction comparatively easy. During half the year the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed supplies a means of communication for the 25 miles of its course through the District, but rocky barriers render the navigation a difficult task.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1861, Bil\u00e1spur was formed into a separate District under the British Government of the Central Provinces. It is administered by a Deputy Commissioner, with 2 Assistant Commissioners and 3 tahsild\u00e1rs. Total revenue in 1868\u201369, \u00a331,977, of which the land yielded \u00a327,195; total cost of officials and police of all kinds, \u00a310,802. By 1881\u201382, the gross revenue had increased to \u00a341,339, of which the land contributed \u00a328,093; cost of officials and police, \u00a312,397; number of civil and revenue judges of all sorts, 7; of magistrates, 6; maximum distance from any village to the nearest court, 56 miles; average distance, 10 miles; number of police, 331, being 1 policeman to every 24 square miles and to every 3073 inhabitants. Owing chiefly to the plenty which prevails throughout the District, crime is comparatively rare, and for the most part confined to small offences. In 1881, the daily number of convicts in jail averaged 112\u00b776, of whom 14\u00b720 were females. The number of Government or aided schools in the District under Government inspection in 1881 was 68, attended by 4387 pupils. Bil\u00e1spur, the only municipality, contains a population of 7775 persons; the total municipal income in\n1881 was \u00a3203, of which \u00a378 was derived from taxation, at an average rate of 2\u00bdd. per head.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014From the middle of April to the middle of June hot winds prevail, and the heat is frequently excessive, though tempered by occasional showers. After the first heavy fall of rain, the climate becomes cool and agreeable, and few days pass without a pleasant breeze. In the plain, however, the cold weather from November to February fails to prove bracing. Average temperature in the shade at the civil station\u2014May, highest reading 113\u00b0 F., lowest 84\u00b0; July, highest reading 101\u00b0, lowest 74\u00b0; December, highest reading 89\u00b0, lowest 56\u00b0. From 1862 to 1881 the mean yearly rainfall was 47\u00b726 inches, but in the latter year the fall was 65\u00b732 inches, or 18\u00b706 above the yearly average. In the opinion of Mr. Chisholm\u2014to whose Settlement Report this article is greatly indebted\u2014the climate of Bilaspur has a worse name than it deserves, owing to the attacks of cholera which formerly broke out during the hot weather along the pilgrim route to Jagannath, and thence spread over the country. In 1868, the passage of pilgrims was prohibited, with the best results. Fever proves by far the most fatal disease in the District, and about the end of the cold weather small-pox prevails. In 1882, the recorded death-rate from all causes was 26\u00b719 per 1000 of the population, the mean for the previous five years being 34\u00b780. In that year three charitable dispensaries afforded relief to 20,488 in-door and out-door patients. [For further information regarding Bilaspur see the Settlement Report of the District, by J. W. Chisholm, Esq. (1868); the Central Provinces Gazetteer, by Charles Grant, Esq., C.S., C.S.I. (Nagpur, 1870); the Census Report of the Central Provinces for 1881; and the Administration Reports of those Provinces from 1880 to 1883.]\n\nBilaspur.\u2014Revenue Sub-division or tahsil of Bilaspur District, Central Provinces, lying between 21\u00b0 38' and 22\u00b0 25' N. lat., and between 81\u00b0 46' and 82\u00b0 31' E. long.; population (1881) 418,620, namely, males 209,108, and females 209,512; distributed among 1724 villages or townships, and 120,789 inhabited houses; area, 4770 square miles; average density of population, 88 per square mile; land revenue, \u00a38073; total revenue, \u00a38766; total rental paid by cultivators, \u00a318,594, or 1s. per cultivated acre. The Sub-division contained, in 1883, 4 civil and 4 criminal courts, including the head-quarters courts of the District, with 3 police stations (thun\u00e1s) and 7 outpost stations; strength of regular police, 74 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 749.\n\nBilaspur.\u2014Chief town and administrative head-quarters of Bilaspur District, Central Provinces; on the south bank of the river Arpa. Lat. 22\u00b0 5' N., long. 82\u00b0 12' E.; population (1881) 7775, namely, Hindus, 6281; Kabirpanthis, 242; Satnam\u00eds, 59; Muhammadans, 1030; Christians, 22; aboriginal tribes, 141. Founded about 300\nyears ago by a fisherwoman named Bil\u00e1sa, whence the name Bil\u00e1spur, it long consisted of only a few fishermen's huts, till, about a century ago, Kesava Panth Subah, who administered the District under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, fixed his residence here and began to build a brick fort on the river-bank. Subsequently, on the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s removing their head-quarters to Ratanpur, the rising prosperity of the town dwindled away. In 1862, however, Bil\u00e1spur was constituted the head-quarters of the British District. The belt of woods, the gardens and mango groves, and the distant hills, render the situation pleasant and attractive.\n\n**Bil\u00e1spur.** \u2014 Village in Bulandshahr District, North-Western Provinces; 16 miles south-west of Bulandshahr town, and 2 miles south of Sikandar\u00e1b\u00e1d railway station, with which it is connected by a metalled road. Population (1881) 3292. Post-office, school, market on Saturdays. Chiefly remarkable as head-quarters of the Skinner family and estate, founded by Col. James Skinner, C.B. Handsome house and fine garden adjoining the old mud fort. Mr. T. Skinner held the fort during the Mutiny. Owing to the bad management of his eldest son, the Court of Wards has taken charge of his share of the estate.\n\n**Bil\u00e1spur.** \u2014 One of the Punjab Hill States.\u2014See Kahlur.\n\n**Bil\u00e1spur.** \u2014 Capital of the Bil\u00e1spur or Kahl\u00far State, Punjab, and residence of the R\u00e1j\u00e1. Lat. 31\u00b0 19' N., long. 76\u00b0 50' E. Picturesquely situated on the left bank of the Sutlej, 1465 feet above sea-level. Suffered much in the early part of the present century from the depredations of the Gurkh\u00e1s. Well-built stone houses; b\u00e1z\u00e1r; neat but unpretentious palace of the R\u00e1j\u00e1. Ferry across the Sutlej, 2 miles above the town, forms the chief communication with the Punjab proper.\n\n**Bilaud\u00e1.** \u2014 A guaranteed Th\u00e1kurate under the Western M\u00e1lw\u00e1 Agency of Central India.\n\n**Bilehri.** \u2014 Village in Murw\u00e1r\u00e1 tahsil, Jabalpur District, Central Provinces. Population (1881) 2557, namely, Hindus, 2217; Muhammadans, 287; Jains, 51; aborigines, 2.\n\n**Bilga.** \u2014 Town in Philaur tahsil, Jalandhar (Jullundur) District, Punjab. Lat. 31\u00b0 3' N., long. 75\u00b0 4' 30\" E. Population (1881) 6634, namely, Hindus, 4818; Muhammadans, 1263; and Sikhs, 553. Unimportant, commercially and politically. Formerly possessed a municipality, which was abolished some years ago.\n\n**Bilgr\u00e1m.** \u2014 Tahsil or Sub-division of Hardoi District, Oudh; bounded on the north by Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, and on the east by Hardoi tahsils; on the south by Safipur tahsil of Unao; and on the west by Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d District in the North-Western Provinces. Area, 558 square miles, of which 351 are cultivated. Population (1881), Hindus, 234,635;\nMuhammadans, 24,643; total, 259,278. The tahsil consists of the 5 parganas of Bilgram, Sandi, Katiari, Mallanwan, and Kachhandan. The Sub-division contained, in 1883, 1 civil and 1 criminal court, with 2 police stations (thana); strength of regular police, 46 men; municipal police, 47; village watchmen (chaukidars), 681.\n\nBilgram.\u2014Pargana of Hardoi District, Oudh; bounded on the north by Sandi, on the east and south by Mallanwan, and on the west by Bangar. The pargana was formed in the time of Akbar, and is mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbari as covering 192,800 bighas, and paying a land revenue of 5,124,113 d\u00e3ms, besides 356,690 d\u00e3ms of cesses. It was held by Sayyids, and garrisoned by 1000 foot soldiers and 20 troopers, lodged in a masonry fort. Its area included pargana Bangar. The Raikwars, who expelled the Thatheras, founded the now ruined town and fort of Srinagar in the 9th or 10th century, and held the surrounding country up to the time of the campaign of Shahab-ud-din Ghori in 1193, which resulted in the fall of Kanauj, and the subsequent subjugation of Oudh by Shams-ud-din Altamsh in 1217. The two officers who reduced Srinagar and the surrounding country are the ancestors of the present Muhammadan talukdars of Bilgram. Area, 117 square miles, of which 71 are cultivated. Staple products, barley, bajra, wheat, arhar, joar, and gram. Tobacco is largely grown in the vicinity of Bilgram town. Government land revenue, \u00a37468, showing an average incidence of 3s. 4\u00bdd. per acre of cultivated land, and 1s. 11\u00bdd. per acre of total area. More than half the pargana is held by Sayyids, who own 64 villages; Shaikhs and Pathans each hold 1; Rajputs, 27, of which only 5 now remain to the Raikwars; other castes, 10, while 2 are in the possession of Government. The different tenures under which the villages are held are\u2014talukdari, 58\u00bd; zamindari, 34\u00bd; pattidari, 21. Population (1881) 57,360, namely, 30,762 males and 26,598 females; average density of population, 490 per square mile. The Chamars form a seventh, the Ahirs a ninth, and the Brahmins rather less than a tenth of the population. Two unmetalled roads intersect the pargana.\n\nBilgram.\u2014Chief town of Bilgram tahsil, in Hardoi District, and the twelfth in importance among the towns of Oudh; near the left bank of the old channel of the Ganges, about 15 miles south of Hardoi town. Lat. 27\u00b0 10' 30\" N., long. 80\u00b0 4' 30\" E. In olden times this place was held by the Thatheras, who were expelled by the Raikwars under Raja Sri Ram, who founded a city which he named after himself, Srinagar. The Raikwars in their turn were ousted by the Muhammadans about 1217 A.D. A famous Muhammadan saint, whose tomb is the oldest Musalm\u00e1n building in the place, is said to have slain a demon named Bel by his enchantments, and the name of the place was changed to Belgram or Bilgram. The town abounds with fragments of carved\nstone bas-reliefs, pillars, and capitals of old Hindu columns. Great blocks of stone and kankar mark what are believed to be the remains of the old fort and temple of Srinagar and the Sag\u00e1r tank, constructed by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sr\u00ed R\u00e1m. Population (1881) 11,067, namely, 6353 Hindus, and 4714 Muhammadans; area of town site, 200 acres. Municipal revenue in 1880, \u00a3236, or 4d. per head of municipal population. Principal buildings\u2014the tahsili courts, police station, school, san\u00ed, im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra, and several mosques. The two b\u00e1z\u00e1srs were constructed by the Naw\u00e1b Mehnd\u00ed Ali Kh\u00e1n, as also the large and important grain mart at Raf\u00e1tganj, half a mile south of the town, whence large quantities of wheat and barley are despatched to Kanauj, Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d, and Cawnpur. The principal articles made in Bilgr\u00e1m are brass p\u00e1n boxes, shoes, and sweetmeats. Bilgr\u00e1m is also noted as the birthplace of several famous Muhammadan poets, historians, and Government officials.\n\nBilhaur.\u2014Tahsil of Cawnpur District, North-Western Provinces, lying along the southern bank of the Ganges. Area, 187 square miles, of which 151 are cultivated; population (1881) 100,654; land revenue, \u00a319,353; total revenue, \u00a321,675; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a337,165. The tahsil is watered by two streams. Through the north flows the Isan, which, until close to its junction with the Ganges, runs parallel with that river. The P\u00e1ndu flows near and parallel to the south-west boundary. The soil through which the P\u00e1ndu passes is hard consistent loam (d\u00edma), with an almost level surface, out of which the bed of the river appears to have been cut with difficulty. That traversed by the Isan consists, on the contrary, of light sandy soil, easily eroded by the action of water, or blown by the winds into undulating hillocks. A considerable portion of the tahsil is irrigated, either from the numerous distributaries of the Cawnpur branch of the Ganges Canal, or from wells. The Grand Trunk Road crosses the tahsil from south-east to north-west, with encamping grounds at P\u00fara and Arwal. The tahsil contains 1 criminal court, with 2 police stations (th\u00e1nd\u00e1s); strength of regular police, 36 men; village watchmen (chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs), 230.\n\nBilhaur.\u2014Town in Cawnpur District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of Bilhaur tahsil. Lies on the Grand Trunk Road, 34 miles north-west of Cawnpur, 4 miles from the Ganges, and 1 from the Isan. Lat. 26\u00b0 50' 10\" N., long. 80\u00b0 6' 30\" E.; population (1881) 5889, namely, 3621 Hindus and 2268 Muhammadans; area of town site, 100 acres. A small municipal income for police and conservancy purposes is raised under the provisions of Act xx. of 1856. Centre of local disturbance during the Mutiny of 1857. The public buildings consist of a tahsili, first-class police station, imperial post-office, school and road bungalow. Unmetalled roads connect the town with Ras\u00fal\u00e1b\u00e1d and Makanpur.\nBiligiri-rangan.\u2014Range of hills in the east of the Yelandur j\u00e1gir, running north and south for about 11 miles, in Mysore District, Mysore State, and extending to the Hassanur pass in Coimbatore District, Madras Presidency. Lat. $11^\\circ 40'$ to $12^\\circ 10'$ N., long. $77^\\circ 10'$ E. On the highest point of the western part of the range, about 5000 feet above sea-level, is the temple of Biligiri Rangaswami, the Sanskrit Svetadri, from which the hills are named. The slopes are steep, and covered with long grass and groves of forest trees, including teak and sandal-wood. Wild animals abound, especially elephants, bison, and s\u00e1mbhar deer. The only inhabitants are the wild tribe of Soligars, who occupy isolated hamlets of wattle huts. The summit is reached by two paths, the best of which, 9 miles long, is just passable for horses. There is a good cart road to the foot of the hills from the town of Yelandur, distant about 6 miles. At the top is a bungalow, near which is a cinchona plantation, protected from wild elephants by a deep trench, and in the neighbourhood is a neat little orchard, where some Indian and foreign fruit-trees are grown with great success. Excepting a small garden owned by the sh\u00e1nbh\u00f3g of the temple, coffee-planting has not yet been introduced, though the soil and climate are favourable. The obstacles are fever at certain seasons of the year, and an insufficient supply of drinking water. The temperature is moderate, the thermometer seldom rising above $75^\\circ$ or falling below $60^\\circ$ F. The temple is a shrine of great antiquity, built on the brink of a precipice. An endowment of two villages granted by the Diw\u00e1n Purnaiya yields a revenue of \u00a395. On the summit of a neighbouring peak are the ruins of an old fort.\u2014See Balirangan.\n\nBilihra.\u2014Rent-free estate in S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor) District, Central Provinces, consisting of 5 villages; area, 15 square miles. This estate, which originally comprised 12 villages, was assigned by the Peshw\u00e1 to one Prithwi P\u00e1t at a quit-rent. His descendants remained in undisturbed possession till 1818, when the District was ceded to the British, and the quit-rent tenure was changed. Seven out of the 12 villages were fully assessed, and 5 (the present estate) were continued to the possessors rent-free in perpetuity. Bilihra village contained in 1881 a population of 1519, dwelling in 434 houses. Village school. Land revenue of the estate, \u00a3496; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a3936.\n\nBilimor\u00e1.\u2014Town belonging to the territory of the G\u00e1ckw\u00e1r of Baroda, Bombay Presidency. Situated on the bank of the river Ambika, about 13 miles from Naos\u00e1ri, and 135 miles from Bombay. Lat. $20^\\circ 41'$ N., long. $73^\\circ 4'$ E. It is the seat of a town magistrate, and has a customs-house, dispensary, post-office, and a vernacular school. Population (1881) 4508, namely, 2907 Hindus, 578 Muhammadans, 784 P\u00e1rsis, and 239 Jains. Bilimor\u00e1 is a station on the Bombay and Baroda Railway. Value of sea-borne trade for 1880-81\u2014exports,\n\u00a3107,078; imports, \u00a316,323. A considerable amount of castor-oil is manufactured. Contains a Government bungalow and a P\u00e1rsi tower of silence.\n\n**Bilin (Bhileng or Bheeleng).**\u2014River in the Tenasserim Division of British Burma. It rises in about the latitude of Kyauk-gyi among the mountains between the rivers Sittaung and Salwin, and after a southerly course of 282 miles, falls into the Bay of Bengal eastward of the mouth of the Sittaung. For many miles, the Bilin is shallow with a rapid current. When it enters the plains of Shwe-gyin the bed deepens; and after flowing past Yin-un and Bilin, and receiving the waters of numerous creeks, it becomes very tortuous, and finally spreads out into a bell mouth 2 miles broad, up which a \u2018bore\u2019 rushes with great velocity. This, in the dry season, is felt as far as Bilin town. During the rains the river overflows its banks, and deposits rich alluvial mud on the bordering plains. Those in the south-east, the Thein-seip and Tha-tun, are now protected by the D\u00fcn-won and Kama-thaing embankment, raised a few miles south of the Ky\u00fane-ip river, the southern boundary of Shwe-gyin District. From May to September the portion of the course of the Bilin between the mouths of the Shwe-le creek and Ky\u00fane-ip river forms the main water-route from the Sittaung to Maulmain.\n\n**Bilin (Bhileng, Bheeleng).**\u2014Town and head-quarters of Bilin-Kyaik-to township, Shwe-gyin District, Tenasserim Division, British Burma. Lat. 17\u00b0 14' N., long. 97\u00b0 16' E.; population (1881) 2274, chiefly Burmese traders. A regularly built town, situated on the right bank of the river Bilin, with court and circuit houses, police station, and a market. Uzana, Governor of Martaban, settled here with a number of Burmese followers in 1824, when retreating before the British arms, and was confirmed as governor by the Burmese king. In 1830 he was murdered, and the extent of territory under the governor\u2019s control was reduced. During the second Burmese war, Bilin was surrendered to the British. Soon afterwards, an insurrection, headed by a Shan Th\u00fagy\u00ed, broke out, and was suppressed by our troops. Since that time, the town has several times been attacked and plundered by robbers, and has twice been burnt down and rebuilt. Local revenue (1881-82) \u00a3218.\n\n**Bilin-kyaik-to (Bhileng-kyaik-hto, Bheeleng-kyaik-hto).**\u2014Township in Shwe-gyin District, Tenasserim Division, British Burma. Head-quarters at Bilin town. Population (1881) 38,964, chiefly Talaings and Burmese. Bounded north by the lower range of the Salwin Hill Tracts; south by the Bay of Bengal; east by the Bilin, its only river; and west by the Kadat stream. Bilin-kyaik-to consists of a wide alluvial plain, traversed by numerous streams draining the southern hill slopes, and admitting the full rush of the tide, which rises into a \u2018bore\u2019 in every channel, and\nsweeps up almost to the foot of the hills. The geological formation of the country shows that at no very remote period it was entirely covered by the sea. Local traditions, and the occasional discovery of large cables at Taik-kala and other places inland, help to confirm this opinion. Chief crops, sugar-cane and vegetables. Porcelain clay found on the banks of the Bilin is mixed with other minerals brought by the Shans, who are chiefly engaged in this manufacture, from their States, and made into vessels of rude design. Gross revenue (1882) \u00a39483.\n\n**Bilram.**\u2014Town in Etah District, North-Western Provinces; 19 miles north-east of Etah town. Population (1881) 3254. Connected with the tahsil town of K\u00e1sganj by a broad road. Bi-weekly market. Bilram is said to have been originally founded about 560 years ago by Chauh\u00e1n R\u00e1jputs; but afterwards entirely destroyed by the Muhammadans, and the population either slain or forcibly converted to the faith of their conquerors. The numerous and extensive ruins of mosques and large buildings attest that in former days it must have been a place of considerable importance. The town is now far from flourishing, and has little or no trade. Village school.\n\n**Bilri.**\u2014Petty State in North K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency; consisting of 1 village with 1 independent tribute-payer. Estimated revenue, \u00a3300.\n\n**Bilsi.**\u2014Town in Sahasw\u00e1n tahsil, Bud\u00e1un District, North-Western Provinces; 15 miles north-west of Bud\u00e1un town. Lat. 28\u00b0 7' 45\" N., long. 78\u00b0 56' 50\" E.; population (1881) 6301, namely, 5164 Hindus, 1024 Muhammadans, 107 Jains, and 6 Christians; area of town site, 78 acres. Largest mart for the neighbouring portions of Rohilkhand. The town was founded under the rule of the Naw\u00e1b Waz\u00edrs of Oudh during the last quarter of the 18th century. It consists of two principal wards, Bilsi and S\u00e1hibganj, the latter so called from its being the head-quarters of a large European indigo factory, which has branch factories all over the District. Its commercial activity is probably due to the good roads constructed during the last half-century, which connect it with Chandaus\u00ed, Bud\u00e1un, H\u00e1thras, and Fatehgarh. With these places there is a brisk trade, the principal exports being wheat, sugar, leather, canvas for gunny-bags, and parched rice; the principal imports, cotton, clarified butter and other groceries, salt, red-dye (\u00e1l), iron, brass, and copper utensils, chintz, and English and country cloth. School, dispensary, post-office, and sar\u00e1\u00ed. Municipal revenue in 1880\u201381, \u00a3325, or 1s. 0\u00bdd. per head of municipal population.\n\n**Bil\u00fa-Gywon** (Bhil\u00fa-Gywon, Bheeloo-Gywon).\u2014An island lying in the mouth of the Salwin river, in Amherst District, British Burma; lying between 16\u00b0 15' and 16\u00b0 31' N. lat., and between 97\u00b0 30' and 97\u00b0 39' E. long.; population (1881) 28,020, or 262 per square mile; area, 107 square miles; length, 30 miles, stretching from Martaban to Amherst, of\nwhich District it forms a township. The western portion of the island constituted, under the Burmese, a separate township called Daray, formerly cut off from the rest of the island by the Seibala creek, whose northern end has now entirely silted up. The centre of the island from north to south is occupied by a range of wooded and pagoda-topped hills, sending out spurs which traverse the extensive alluvial plains to the east and west. The head-quarters of Bil\u00fa-Gywon are at Chaung-zun, situated in a dip of the hills in the centre of the island, where there is an artificial reservoir. Between Chaung-zun and the northern end of the island, in the Ka-nyaw Hills, is a hot saline spring, used in cases of rheumatism and skin diseases. The villages are generally large and straggling; and owing to a Talaing prejudice against living in houses not facing the north, most of the dwellings look in that direction. The island is intersected by creeks, which enable its produce to be exported at little expense. The chief crop is rice. There are two roads in the island. Under the Burmese, this township, exclusive of Daray, was divided into twelve 'Ywa,' meaning in this instance tracts of country divided off for fiscal purposes, and each placed under a Th\u00fagy\u00ed. After the cession of Tenasserim to the British, and the re-peopling of the township, the revenue divisions became tribal instead of territorial. In 1848, Captain (now Sir Arthur) Phayre, the Deputy Commissioner, fixed the boundaries of the circles, retaining as far as possible the limits of the ancient divisions. In certain cases, as when the reduction of a Th\u00fagy\u00ed's office might be felt as a hardship, the Ywa was divided. Eighteen circles were thus formed, but the number was reduced in 1868 to 15, and is now (1883) 12.\n\nRice cultivation has very considerably increased. In 1848, the number of acres under tillage was 15,225; in 1858, it was 27,606; in 1868, 32,545; in 1873, 42,318; in 1876, 41,274; and in 1881, 46,469. Gross revenue (1881), \u00a314,891, of which \u00a310,760 was derived from the land. Bil\u00fa-gywon means 'Caco-demon Island,' the name being derived from traditions of former cannibal inhabitants.\n\n**Bimlipatam.**\u2014Zamind\u00e1ri in Vizagapatam District, Madras Presidency. Houses, 24,329, grouped into 119 villages, all zamind\u00e1ri. Population (1881) 106,267, namely, 53,645 males and 52,622 females. Hindus numbered 104,953; Muhammadans, 962; Christians, mostly Roman Catholics, 343; 'others,' 9. Area, 211 square miles.\n\n**Bimlipatam.**\u2014Town in Vizagapatam District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 17\u00b0 53' 15\" N., long. 83\u00b0 29' 50\" E.; houses, 1735; population (1881) 8582, namely, 7991 Hindus, 359 Muhammadans, and 232 Christians. Situated on the coast 18 miles north-east of Vizagapatam, and 454 south-west from Calcutta. Municipal revenue in 1881, \u00a31102; incidence of municipal taxation, including tolls, per head of rateable population, 1s. 8\u00bdd. The amount allotted for sanitary purposes in\n1880-81 was \u00a3225. Birth-rate 18\u00b70 per 1000, and death-rate 29\u00b79 per 1000 of population within municipal limits. Subordinate magistrate's court, dispensary, post and telegraph offices, etc. As the chief port of the District, Bimlipatam enjoys a large trade. In 1852-53, the total tonnage entering the port was 83,760; by 1868 the value of the exports had risen to \u00a3220,000, and that of the imports to \u00a3310,000. Besides this, the trade in bullion was\u2014imports, \u00a392,793, and exports, \u00a321,334. The returns for 1880-81 show a total tonnage of 218,022 tons; the exports being valued at \u00a3257,476, and the imports at \u00a3289,873. In 1881-82 the exports were valued at \u00a3237,260, and the imports at \u00a3205,492. The chief exports are gingelly, indigo, and myrabolans; and the imports are cotton-twist, piece-goods, machinery, and liquors. Though an open roadstead, the port is somewhat protected by the Upada and Sugar-loaf headlands; and good anchorage, in 6\u00bd fathoms, can be obtained 2 miles off shore. The river does not admit boats of more than 60 tons, and these only during a portion of the year. The Madras Bank has a branch here. Tradition derives the name from Bh\u00edma, one of the P\u00e1ndu princes, who is said to have founded the town. In the 17th century, the Dutch erected a factory here, and held it till 1825, when it was ceded to the Company. Till 1846, Bimlipatam remained a mere fishing village, but in that year began to attract European capital and enterprise. It now forms a regular place of call for coasting steamers and ships. The statistics given above show that the tonnage of vessels visiting the port has multiplied three-fold since 1853.\n\n**Bindki.**\u2014Town in Fatehpur District, North-Western Provinces. Population (1881) 6698, namely, Hindus, 5213; and Muhammadans, 1485; area of town site, 122 acres.\n\n**Bindr\u00e1ban.**\u2014A sacred city of the Hindus, in Muttra District, North-Western Provinces.\u2014See Brind\u00e1ban.\n\n**Bindr\u00e1naw\u00e1g\u00e1rh.**\u2014Estate or zam\u00edn-d\u00e1r\u00ed in R\u00e1ipur tahs\u00edl, R\u00e1ipur District, Central Provinces. Area 1449 square miles, a small proportion only of which is under cultivation; number of villages, 279; occupied houses, 10,456; population (1881) 37,079, namely, 19,323 males and 17,756 females; average density of population, 25\u00b76 per square mile. The chief is a Gond by caste.\n\n**Binginapalli.**\u2014Village in Nellore District, Madras Presidency. Population (1881) 1257. Till recently a large salt export station, with a local manufacture of 110,000 maunds per annum.\n\n**Binlaing (Bhenglaing).**\u2014River in Amherst District, Tenasserim Division, British Burma; formed by the junction of the D\u00fanthami and Kyauk-Sarit, and falling into the Salwin in lat. 16\u00b0 45' N. It flows between high and wooded banks, and is navigable throughout. Across its mouth a sandbar has formed, impassable at low water. During the\nrains, it is used as the ordinary route between Maulmain and the Sittaung river.\n\n**Bir.**\u2014Village with iron mines in Kangra District, Punjab; 28 miles from Kangra fort. Lat. $32^\\circ 2' 45''$ N., long. $76^\\circ 46' 15''$ E. The mining district lies in the Dhola Dh\u00e1r range, and extends for some 14 miles along the valley of the river Ul, its centre being at the village of Dharm\u00e1ni. The ore occurs in the form of crystalline magnetic oxide of iron, embedded in decomposed and friable mica-schists. It is worked at its outcrop in open quarries. The metal produced equals in quality the finest iron obtained in England; but, owing to the remoteness of the mines from any large market, the inadequacy of the fuel supply, the imperfect means of communication, and the limited amount of labour available, very small quantities are at present smelted. The estimated out-turn does not exceed 100 tons per annum. Developed by European capital and engineering skill, the mines of Bir might possibly produce large quantities of excellent metal. The ore is of the same character as that from which the best Swedish iron is manufactured.\n\n**Bir Bandh.**\u2014An embankment running along the west bank of the D\u00e1\u00fas river, in the north of Bh\u00e1galpur District, Bengal. It is usually represented as being a fortification erected by a prince named Bir; and this supposition is favoured by the fact that the D\u00e1\u00fas is at present an insignificant stream, which does not require embanking. At one time, however, it was probably much larger, and it may be that the Bir Bandh was raised to restrain its overflow.\n\n**Biramganta.**\u2014Town and formerly a salt-station in Nellore District,
