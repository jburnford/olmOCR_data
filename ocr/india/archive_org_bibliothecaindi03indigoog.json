CALAND\nExtra Professor of Sanskrit at the University of Utrecht.\n\nVOLUME II\n\nCALCUTTA:\nPRINTED AT THE BAPTIST MISSION PRESS,\nAND PUBLISHED BY THE ASIATIC SOCIETY, 57, PARK STREET.\n1907.\nPREFACE.\n\nIn preparing the text of this second volume of the Bandh\u0101yana-\n\u015brautas\u016btra the editor has had to cope with many more difficul-\nties than he had to do when preparing the text of the first\nvolume. Indeed, a few months ago I was almost despairing of\nobtaining sufficient material for this volume. The fact is, that\nthe tradition of these parts of the s\u016btra, describing for the greater\npart the rituals, partly obsolete, partly less observed than the\ndar\u015bap\u016brnam\u0101sa, agny\u0101dh\u0113ya and agnistoma, is, throughout\nIndia, a very bad one. The MSS. of Bombay, Benares,\nGwalior, Dhar and Ujjain are all together more or less corrupt and\nseem partly to derive from one archetype, in which not only were\nlost the right arrangement of the materials and the numbering of\nthe pra\u015bnas, adhy\u0101yas and khandik\u0101s, but the text of which\nwas also hopelessly corrupt in many a passage. And no com-\nplete copy of Bhavasv\u0101min's Vivarana, which would have been of\nparamount use, seems to be extant. Although Professor\nHultzsch has taken all possible pains to hunt up more MSS. from\nSouthern India and has set to work two pandits to unearth\nmore material, he has, alas, not succeeded. Professor Bhandar-\nkar of Elphinstone College also was kind enough to provide me\nwith more material, but it was of the same kind: on the whole\ncorrupt from beginning to end.\n\nNearly despairing, I wrote to Dr. Thomas, Librarian-in-Chief\nto the India Office, requesting him to look over, for my sake, once\nmore the Mackenzie Collection of Sanskrit MSS. preserved at the\nIndia Office. And he was so fortunate as to light upon one MS.\n(cp. infra the enumeration of the MSS.) containing a wholly\nindependent tradition of the text I stood in need of so much.\nThis MS., too, is far from faultless, but it throws light on many a\ndifficult passage, and, what is the main point, the arrangement of\nthe pra\u015bnas seems to be correct in this MS. Before I knew\nthis Mackenzie MS., I had my doubts about which part of the\ns\u016btra constituted the so-called uttar\u0101 tatt\u0101. In the MS. from\nBenares, where the pra\u015bnas are all numbered by a secunda manus\n(cp. my paper \"\u00dcber das rituelle S\u016btra des Bandh\u0101yana,\" p. 12),\nthe pra\u015bna coming after the dv\u0101da\u015b\u0101ha and gav\u0101m ayana, num-\nbered here as the 17th, contains the atir\u0101tra, the sautr\u0101mani and\nthe ek\u0101da\u015bini. In the copy of Bhavasv\u0101min's Vivarana, known to\nme from the beginning up to the aup\u0101nuv\u0101kya (consequently\ngiving the first fourteen pra\u015bnas complete), is found neither the\n\u0101\u015bvamedha nor the dv\u0101da\u015b\u0101ha and gav\u0101m ayana, but immedi-\nately after the aup\u0101nuv\u0101kya comes the ek\u0101da\u015bini. Now, as the\nMS. of Bhavasv\u0101min ends with the words: iti bhavasv\u0101minikte\nkalpavivarane tatau dvitiyo 'dhy\u0101ya\u1e25, and the Mackenzie MS. agrees exactly with this numbering, as it gives the number dvitiya\u1e25 precisely at the end of the passage treated lastly by Bhavasv\u0101min; there is no doubt at all that the Mackenzie MS. is right and that the uttar\u0101 tati\u1e25 begins with the atir\u0101tra and the immediately following ek\u0101da\u015bini. This being the case, the statement of B and Be, that the 17th pra\u015bna should have contained the atir\u0101tra, sautr\u0101ma\u1e47i and ek\u0101da\u015bini must be false. On account of the fact that the Mackenzie MS. agrees in this respect with Bhavasv\u0101min and that in other points this MS., of all those known to me, also seems to have preserved the correct order, I have adopted the arrangement of the materials as given by this MS. In consequence of this arrangement, the one adopted previously has been abandoned: thus the numbering of the pra\u015bnas and partially that of the adhy\u0101yas in the text coming after the gav\u0101m ayana is wholly different from the numbering followed by me in citing passages from Baudh\u0101yana in my above paper on this s\u016btra. But however valuable this Mackenzie MS. may be, it has not cleared up all the dubia regarding the arrangement of the materials. There are two more points to be settled. The first is a question analogous to a difficulty in the construction of the text of Vol. I (the place where the pravargya had to be put in), viz., the place to be assigned to the K\u0101\u1e6dhaka\u015b\u016btra. In the MSS. from Benares (Be) and Bombay (B) it is numbered as the 18th, in the MS. Haug it is numbered as the 21st. The Mackenzie MS. assigns a place to this pra\u015bna between the agnicayana and the vajapeya, without, however, giving a pra\u015bna-number to it. As the contents of this pra\u015bna are mentioned neither in the Dvaidha- nor in the Karm\u0101nta\u015b\u016btra, no further information is to be obtained from these texts. But as it is highly improbable that this pra\u015bna should have formed part of the uttar\u0101 tati\u1e25, the number 18 assigned to it by Be and B can by no means be right. In accordance with the MS. Haug, and with the place occupied by this material in the br\u0101hma\u1e47a (viz., at the end of the Taitt. Br\u0101hm.) I have inserted it after the uttar\u0101 tati\u1e25. In consequence of this new arrangement the numbers of the following pra\u015bnas (Dvaidha, Karm\u0101nta and Pr\u0101ya\u015bcitta) will have to be changed accordingly. By doing so I may come into collision with the original numbering, which, it seems, is unknown to us. But this is a point of minor importance.\n\nAnother question has also puzzled me greatly. In the uttar\u0101 tati\u1e25, as handed down to us in the Mackenzie MS., two\n\n---\n\n1 Pra\u015bna numbers are not found in the Mack. MS.\n2 This MS. gives as the number of the K\u0101\u1e6dhakapra\u015bna: 21; the same MS. numbers the three Karm\u0101ntapra\u015bnas: 22, 23, 24; and the Dvaidhapra\u015binas: 25, etc. This is obviously an error (cp. my paper on the Bandh. s\u016btra, p. 13, 14). But at any rate this MS. inserts the K\u0101\u1e6dhaka immediately before Dvaidha and Karm\u0101nta.\nadhy\u0101yas are found, the contents of which are entirely foreign to a \u015brautas\u016btra, viz. the adhy\u0101yas 12 and 13 of pra\u015bna 17, treating of the sam\u0101vartana, a subject we would expect to be treated rather in the grhyas\u016btra. Now, the tradition of the grhyas\u016btra is in this respect not wholly consistent either. Most of the MSS. of the grhyas\u016btra have in the grhyas\u016btra proper (second pra\u015bna) a chapter commencing thus: vedam adhitya sn\u0101syann ity uktam sam\u0101vartanam, and in the so-called paribh\u0101\u1e63\u0101-s\u016btra a chapter commencing: vedam adhitya sn\u0101syann ity upakalpayate, etc. This last part is identical with the long passage found in the Mackenzie MS. of the \u015brautas\u016btra and here inserted as adhy\u0101ya 12 of the first uttar\u0101 tati\u1e25 pra\u015bna. This distribution of the material in the MSS. of the grhyas\u016btra cannot possibly be right, for obviously the passage vedam adhitya sn\u0101syann ity uktam sam\u0101vartanam refers to the passage vedam adhitya sn\u0101syann ity upakalpayate, which therefore must have preceded. I possess a very good copy in Grantha writing of the whole grhyas\u016btra, kindly procured me by Professor Hultzsch. In this MS. the long passage commencing: vedam adhitya sn\u0101syann ity upakalpayate (the passage given by the Mackenzie MS. as forming part of the \u015brautas\u016btra) stands where the chapter vedam adhitya sn\u0101syann ity uktam sam\u0101vartanam is inserted by the other MSS. Before the Mackenzie MS. came into my hands I thought this was all right. But not long ago I received one more copy of the grhyas\u016btra, copied from an original preserved at Madras. This MS. throws some light on this hitherto obscure point. Where the other MSS. (except the one from Madras, designed by me as M) have the chapter vedam adhitya sn\u0101syann ity uktam sam\u0101vartanam, this MS. reads: vedam adhitya sn\u0101syann ity uktam sam\u0101vartanam; asya sam\u0101vartanasya n\u0101tra p\u0101\u1e6dha\u1e25, kimtu anyatra pathitam; atra samgrhya vil\u012bkhitam atropayogat; then comes the text given by Mackenzie as xvii. 12 and 13, and the rest of the chapter vedam adhitya sn\u0101syann ity uktam sam\u0101vartanam. Now, as it is impossible that the passage referred to in the opening words ity uktam sam\u0101vartanam could have followed, it seems highly probable that the treatment of the sam\u0101vartana was originally incorporated in the uttar\u0101 tati\u1e25, and that here the Mackenzie MS. is right too. I possess now another copy of the complete grhyas\u016btra, which confirms this statement. This MS. gives in the second pra\u015bna the chapter vedam adhitya sn\u0101syann ity uktam sam\u0101vartanam, but in the paribh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 the text given by the Mackenzie MS. (as xvii. 12, 13) is not found. It is not improbable that the scribes of our \u015brautas\u016btra, finding the treatment of the sam\u0101vartana foreign to a \u015brautas\u016btra, omitted it and inserted it in a more proper place (the grhyas\u016btra), disturbing, in doing so, the first pra\u015bna of the uttar\u0101 tati\u1e25. For it is remarkable that none of all the other MSS. of the \u015brautas\u016btra give for this pra\u015bna (the 17th) any adhy\u0101ya- or kha\u1e47\u1e0dik\u0101-number; the Mackenzie MS., on the other hand, gives the adhy\u0101ya- and kha\u1e47\u1e0dik\u0101-numbers, and, in accordance with this\nfact, at the close of this pra\u015bna, all the pratikas of the adhy\u0101yas and khandik\u0101s, including those of the chapters on sam\u0101vartana. How it occurred to the disceunats of the \u015br\u0101ntas\u016btra to insert the sam\u0101vartana among the subjects treated in the \u015br\u0101ntas\u016btra, I am, however, at a loss to explain.\n\nSo this Mackenzie MS. was of the greatest help in constituting the text of Vol ii. The tradition of the cayana, v\u0101japeya and r\u0101jas\u016bya chapters is in this MS. inferior to that of the following chapters. To these, however, it is of the greatest value: entire passages, omitted by all the other MSS., are found here, and in many a passage it is easy to prove that only the reading found in M. (Mackenzie) is right, over against the oftentimes unanimous reading of all the other MSS. As no complete copy of the Vivarana seems to be available, we are thrown upon our own resources to understand the meaning of this text. Of some use are, of course, the cognate texts of \u0100pastamba and Hiranyakesin, but, as these are much more real s\u016btras than the text of Bandh\u0101yana, and consequently, on the whole, much shorter, the help procured from these texts is rather inefficient. In passages, where new words or unknown expressions occur, I have, therefore, as a rule, adhered to the reading of M. The corruption of the other MSS. is so great, that it is not worth while mentioning all their various readings. So, e.g., in the description of the vr\u0101tyastomas: here the text of all the MSS., with the exception of M., is one hopeless confusion. It is highly to be regretted, that this Mackenzie MS. is not wholly complete: some final leaves are wanting; consequently the text of the important last chapters of the second uttar\u0101tatihpra\u015bna had to be edited as well as possible after the corrupt MSS. This is all the more to be regretted as they contain the legends of Pur\u016bravas and U\u015banas.\n\nAfter the above remarks, the reader and student of the second volume of Bandh\u0101yana will be indulgent to the editor, who thought it better to give a text, however imperfect, rather than postpone its publication ad calendas graecas, as, after years of inquiry, no more help seemed to be forthcoming.\n\nAfter these preliminary remarks, I shall now give a list of the MSS. used in editing Vol. ii.\n\n1. M, being No. xxviii. (new number: 92) of the Mackenzie Collection at the India Office, see Wilson, a descriptive catalogue of the Oriental MSS. collected by Lt.-Col.

The av\u0101ntaradik\u1e63\u0101 is not found in this collection. It contains on 158 leaves (numbered continuously) the contents of Vol. i.; the pravargya comes after the agni\u1e63\u1e6doma; it closes with kh. 17. Then come the agnicayana, v\u0101japeya, etc. No pra\u1e47\u0101na numbers are given here and in the following parts, which are all numbered separately; its colophon runs: \u015b\u0101ke 1762 bh\u0101drapada k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a 2 r\u0101vi\u015b\u0101ra taddine \u1e5b\u1e63have ity upan\u0101makagamesabha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101tmajar\u0101ma-candra\u015ba likhitam. Through the kind mediation of Professor Bhandarkar I was allowed the use of this MS.\n\nMSS. containing single parts:\u2014\n\n5. H cp.

Paper, N\u0101gari writing, different handwriting. It contains the i\u1e63\u1e6dikalpa in a rather good tradition, although badly written; the dv\u0101da\u015b\u0101hapra\u1e47\u0101na, atir\u0101tra, uttar\u0101 tati\u1e25, very badly written and in the same hopelessly corrupt tradition as the other MSS.\n\n8. Tr, being a copy in Grantha writing on paper from an original in Trichinopoly, pretending to be a complete \u015br\u0101ntas\u016btra (!). It contains: the whole of the text already published in Vol. i.; the pravargya, together with its pr\u0101ya\u015bcitta and the av\u0101ntaradik\u1e63\u0101, precedes the agni\u1e63\u1e6doma. After the agni\u1e63\u1e6doma come: 1. cayana (foll. 225-276); 2. santr\u0101mani (foll. 277-282); 3. v\u0101japeya (foll. 282-297); 4. atir\u0101tra (foll. 297-305); 5. aptory\u0101ma (foll. 305-306); 6. the three pr\u0101ya\u015bcitta pra\u1e47\u0101nas (foll. 306-343). The pra\u1e47\u0101na numbering of this copy is utterly worthless.\n\n9.

Dvaidhas\u016btra.\n\n1. H, from the Haug collection at Munich, containing only the first two pra\u015bnas and the first k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dik\u0101 of pra\u015bna 3.\n2. Bu, a MS. from the collection Burnell belonging to the India Office, containing the complete text, without the sarvatomukhadvaidhas.\n3. Be (see Preface to vol. i, p. viii).\n4. B, the Bombay MS. (see Preface to vol. i, p. vii), giving only the last two pra\u015bnas.\n5. Ben, copy from a Benares MS., containing the first pra\u015bna only.\n6. D, a MS. from Dhar, containing on 37 foli. the first two pra\u015bnas and the first k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dik\u0101 of pra\u015bna 3. Nearly related with H.\n7. U, from Ujjain, in N\u0101gar\u012b, on 59 foli., complete; the sarvatomukhadvaidhas on a separate leaf. This MS. belongs to the same collection and is written by the same hand, and on the same kind of paper, as all the other Baudh\u0101yana MSS. from Ujjain (see Preface to vol. ii, p. v).\n8. G; this MS. has been found at Gwalior; for the use of this MS., like No. 6 and 7, I have to thank Prof. Bhandarkar. These three MSS. were found in private libraries. The Gwalior MS. is written very neatly in N\u0101gar\u012b and although far from faultless originally, it has been corrected with good judgment after a better text. The sarvatomukha is given apart.\n9. C, No. 2188 of the Gov. Skt. MSS. Collection, Asiatic Society of Bengal, containing on foli. 1\u201370 the first two pra\u015bnas and the beginning of pra\u015bna 3; much related to H. and D.\n10. C', No. 1571 of the same collection, N\u0101gar\u012b, paper; the text begins with xxi, 14 and runs to the end, without the sarvatomukha; nearly related to Be.\n11. W, the MS. of the collection Whish, cp. Winternitz, a Catalogue of South Indian MSS. No. 94. Only partly collated.\n\nThe vivarana of the Dvaidha is extant and known to me from several MSS., which, however, are far from exact. Of use were also the Prayogas\u0101ra by Ke\u015bavasv\u0101min, the bh\u0101sya composed by S\u0101yana, who in his treatment of the dar\u015bap\u016br\u1e47a-\nm\u0101sa mentions and comments upon all the Dvaidha and Karm\u0101nta passages, which bear upon the text proper of Baudh\u0101yana. By Ms. I indicate in the critical notes the Mah\u0101gnissarvasva (see Preface to vol. ii, p. v), which treats equally of those Dvaidha and Karm\u0101nta s\u016btras that concern the agnicayana of the text proper.\n\nb. Karm\u0101ntas\u016btra.\n\n1. H, the Haug MS., complete.\n2. Be, see Preface to vol. i, p. viii.\n3. D, the Dhar MS., containing on 35 foll. the first two pra\u015bnas.\n4. U, the Ujjain MS., 56 foll., \u015bake 1761.\n5. G, the Gwalior MS., on 46 foll.; corrected. The last three MSS. belong to the same collections as those of the Dvaidha text.\n6. M, the Mackenzie MS.; cp. Preface to vol. ii, p. iv.\n7. Ben, a copy of the Gov. Skt. Coll. at Benares; rather good and independent MS.\n8. C, No. 2188 of the Gov. Skt. MSS. Collection at the Asiatic Society of Bengal, N\u0101gar\u012b, on paper, well written, 133 foll., containing on foll. 71\u2013133 the first two Karm\u0101nta pra\u015bnas.\n\nBesides the vivarana of Bhavasv\u0101min and the remarks of S\u0101yana and Ke\u015bavasv\u0101min, we possess a valuable bh\u0101\u1e63ya on Karm\u0101nta I. 1\u201321 (No. 776a of the collection in the India Office; see Eggeling, Catalogue of the Sanskrit MSS. in the Library of the I.O., vol. i, p. 57) by Ve\u1e45kate\u015bvara; the var. lect. of the text according to this work is indicated by me in the critical notes as Vt., that of the commentary given by Ve\u1e45kate\u015bvara as Vc.\n\nc. Pr\u0101ya\u015bcititas\u016btra.\n\n1. H, the MS. Haug.\n2. U, from Ujjain, on 25 foll., part of the same collection as mentioned above.\n3. B, the Bombay MS.; see Preface to vol. i, p. vii, copy from an original, dated \u015bake 1743.\n4. Tr, the MS. from Trichinopoly, mentioned in the Preface to vol. ii, p. v.\n5. Cl, a part of the text is found in the MS., mentioned under the MSS. for the Dvaidhas\u016btra (No. 10).\n\nMore or less help was got from Gop\u0101la\u2019s Vivarana (Viv.) known to me from the MS. belonging to the India Office (No. 259b; see Eggeling, Catalogue, vol. i, p. 91). The text proper is here indicated only by the beginning words of each\nsentence. I consulted also, without, however, getting much help from them, the Pr\u0101ya\u015bcitta-prad\u012bpa (I.O. 1467A) and the Pr\u0101ya\u015bcitta-candrik\u0101 (I.O. 1572).\n\nd. Sulbas\u016btra.\n\n1. H, the MS. Haug.\n2. U, from Ujjain, on 12 foll., part of the same collection as mentioned above.\n3. B, the Benares MS.; see Preface to vol. i, p. viii.\n4. M, the Mackenzie MS.; see Preface to vol. ii, p. v.\n\nI need not say, that the excellent edition with Skt. commentary and English translation by Thibaut (in the Journal \"Pandit\" (vols. ix, x and vol i of the new series) has been consulted with good results. The readings accepted by Thibaut are indicated by me by T.\n\ne. Pravaras\u016btra.\n\n1. T, a copy from the Tanjore MS. No. 359; see Preface to vol. i, p. x.\n2. M, being a complete copy of the Sm\u0101rtas\u016btra in Grantha, copied for me somewhere in Madras through the kind mediation of Prof. Hultzsch. It is, on the whole, a good MS.; at the end of it the pravara is found.\n3. G, the Grantha edition of the Baudh\u0101yana sm\u0101rta-s\u016btra, Madras, 1905, by Muddudik\u1e63ita. This edition narrowly agrees with the MS. M.\n4. Bu, the Burnell MS. xciii (No. cxviii of the Catalogue of a collection of Sanskrit MSS., p. 35) in Grantha. It contains also the pravarakhanda of the Vaikh\u0101nasa school. Independent, although rather bad MS.\n5. Be, copied by me from the Benares MS. 115; see Preface to vol. i, p. vii.\n6. U, from Ujjain (see above), very narrowly related to the last-mentioned MS. from Benares; on 10 foll.\n\nOther texts which have been used in constituting the pravarapra\u015bna are:\n\nThe Gotrapravarama\u00f1jar\u012b by Purusottama, a Colebrooke MS. belonging to the India Office (No. 2316A, Egg. No. 1777). In the critical notes indicated by me as Pm. It contains shattered all over the work the whole pravara text of the Baudh\u0101yanas, on which it comments broadly. It treats at length also of the pravara sections of \u0100pastamba and \u0100\u015bval\u0101yana and of the pravar\u0101dhy\u0101yas of K\u0101ty\u0101yana-La\u1e45g\u0101k\u1e63i. The comparison of this text is of use for the verification of several nomina propria. It is curious to perceive, that, although according to Purusottama the pravarakhanda\u015b of K\u0101ty\u0101yana and La\u1e45g\u0101k\u1e63i are the\nsame, the K\u0101ty\u0101yana text known to us from the Pari\u015bistas of\nthe White Yajurveda (see Weber in the 'Verzeichniss der Skt.\nHSS. der Kgl. Bibl. zu Berlin,' vol. i, p. 54-60) is different\nfrom that given by Puru\u1e63ottama. The one contributed to\nLaug\u0101ksi is probably the pravar\u0101dhya of the Kathas; the\ntext attributed by tradition to K\u0101ty\u0101yana (as given by Weber)\nagrees, with many various readings, however, on the whole,\nwith the pravar\u0101dhya of the M\u0101navas. I was kindly\nallowed by Prof. Knauer to use this text, which also is handed\ndown to us in a very corrupted state.\n\nA lengthy treatment of the pravara is given also by\nGopin\u0101thadik\u1e63ita in his Satyas\u0101dha\u1e25iranyaketism\u0101rtasamsk\u0101ra-\nratnam\u0101l\u0101 (published in the \u0100nand\u0101\u015brama, series 1-99) on pp.\n415-453; by Anantadeva in his Samsk\u0101rakaustubha, pp. 179-\n196 of the lithographic edition, and by Raghun\u0101tha in his\nGotrapravaranir\u1e47aya (MS. I.O. No 1781). These three texts\nare indicated by me in the critical notes successively as Rm.,\nSk., Pn. The three texts give a great many more names\nthan are contained in the pravarapra\u015bna of Baudh\u0101yana, as\nthey join, without any discrimination, to the names of the\nBaudh\u0101yana text also those of other pravarakhandas. More-\nover, they constantly put in the plural all the names found in\nthe singular in our text.\n\nOf some importance is a certain gotra list as handed down\namong the Desastha br\u0101hma\u1e47as in: Census of India, 1801, vol. i,\nIndia, Ethnographic Appendices, by H. H. Risley, Calcutta,\n1903, on pp. 120-122.\n\nThe text of this pra\u015bna is one of the most difficult to\nreconstruct. Rarely we find the proper names without variants.\nThe MSS. can be divided into two groups: M (with G) T and Ba\non one side, Be (with U) and Pm on the other. The other\nnibandhas seem to draw on Pm.\n\nThe pravarapra\u015bna in the kalpas\u016btra of the Baudh\u0101ya-\nniyas was probably placed originally immediately behind the\npit\u1e5bmedhas\u016btra and before the dharma\u015b\u0101stra. It is inserted\nthere in M and in the Grantha edition; cp. the words of Puru-\nsottama in his gotrapravarama\u00f1jari: ukt\u0101ny a\u015bitik\u0101saumikap\u0101-\nsukad\u0101rvihomik\u0101khy\u0101ni caturvidh\u0101ni braut\u0101ni dar\u015bap\u016brn\u0101ma-\ndini s\u016btr\u0101ni. The number given on the fly-leaf of the Ujjain\nMS. is xli. But nowhere in the MSS. themselves any indication\nof pra\u015bna number is found. Even the number xxx of the Sulba-\ns\u016btra is conjectural; on the cover of the MS. Ben. 115 is written\n\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0936\u0942\u0932\u0947\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0930\u093e\u092f. Although, then, the number of the pra\u015bnas\ncannot be given with certainty, their sequence, in the main, is\nfirmly established.\n\nIt was originally my intention to include in this edition of\nthe Baudh\u0101yana texts also the whole sm\u0101rta\u015b\u016btra. But I now prefer to give only the \u015brautas\u016btra; perhaps I may undertake later on a critical edition of this text, which indeed is now accessible, be it not in critical editions. One is the Grantha edition mentioned under the MSS. used for the pravarapra\u015bna, the other has appeared at Mysore (1904) under the title: \u0936\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0935\u0923\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092f\u0938\u0942\u0924\u094d\u0930\u092e\u094d\u0964 The Bodh\u0101yana-grhya-s\u016btra edited by L. \u015ar\u012bniv\u0101sach\u0101rya. On the other hand, I thought fit to edit the Sulbas\u016btra anew, even after the excellent work of Prof. Thibaut, because it had to be given to make the \u015brautas\u016btra complete, and also because my MSS. enabled me to give in some places a better reading than Thibaut\u2019s text presents. I have taken much pains to obtain a copy of a part of the Baudh\u0101yana kalpas\u016btra, which must have existed, but seems to be lost now, viz. the hautras\u016btra. Bhavasv\u0101min and S\u0101yana quote often from this text, as also does the commentary on the third book of the Taittir\u012bya br\u0101hma\u1e47a.\n\nMy design of publishing the vivarana of Bhavasv\u0101min I also regret very much that I am compelled to abandon. The manuscript material is utterly insufficient. Perhaps I may in later times fulfill also this promise. For the time being I will try to fill up at least partially this gap, by adding to this third volume an index of words, giving, wherever it is possible, the explication of the commentators.\n\nAt the end of my task I have to express my sincerest thanks to all who kindly helped to procure me the material for my work: especially to Dr. Thomas, Chief Librarian to the India Office, and to Prof. Bhandarkar. If this volume can now appear, it is chiefly due to their kind assistance.\n\nW.

I have adopted the sequence proffered by Be U for two reasons; the first is that the text of Baudh\u0101yana seems to point to it, as treating in its paribh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 (p. 415, 4) of the Vi\u015bv\u0101mitras before the Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dhas; the second reason is, that \u0100pastamba Hiranyak\u0101sin and \u0100\u015bval\u0101yana observe the same order.\n\nThus Be U and the nibandhas; (amongst the Vi\u015bv\u0101mitras a name is mentioned by Hiranyak\u0101sin), Bu, M G T.\n\nThus M G T Bu (and cp. of K\u0101ty.), Be U, the nibandhas.\n\nInstead of M G T (Bu as Be U).\n\nThus (read perhaps ) Be U; Pm; or the nibandhas; G, Bu; M T om. this name.\n\nThus ( ) G T, Bu, M, Be U Pm; or the nibandhas.\n\nThus M G, T, Bu, Be U, (or ) the nibandhas.\n\nFound in M G T only (perhaps ditto gr. from the following name ?).\n\u0915\u093e\u092e\u0928\u0915\u093e \u092c\u093e\u092f\u0915\u0935\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u092a\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0903 \u0938\u093e\u092e\u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0903 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u091a\u0941\u0930\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0903\u0964\n\u0917\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0939\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0903 \u0936\u094c\u0915\u093e\u0903 \u0917\u094c\u0930\u093e\u0903 \u0935\u0948\u0917\u0928\u094d\u0927\u094b\u0903 \u092f\u092e\u0926\u0941\u0924\u093e \u0917\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0939\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0903\u0964\n\u0938\u093e\u0930\u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0935\u0940\u0915\u093e\u0903 \u091c\u093e\u0924\u093e\u0903 \u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0903\u0964\n\n1 Thus Be U Bu and the nibandhas, \u0915\u093e\u092e\u0928\u0915\u094b M G T.\n2 Thus M G Bu, \u092a\u093e\u091a\u092f\u094b T; \u0928\u092c\u0915\u093e\u092f\u094b Be U and the nibandhas.\n3 Thus Be U, \u0915\u093e\u092e\u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0903 Rm Sk, \u091c\u093e\u092e\u0915\u0940\u092f\u093e\u0903 Pn, \u091c\u093e\u092e\u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0903 Pm; \u091c\u093e\u092e\u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0903 Bu, \u091c\u093e\u092e\u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0903 M G, \u091c\u093e\u092e\u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0903 T.\n4 Thus (cp.

The New Series was begun in 1860, and is still running.\n\nAs a rule the issues in the series consist of fascicles of 96 or 100 pages print, though occasionally numbers are issued of double, triple or larger bulk, and in a few cases even entire works have been published under a single issue number. Several different works are always simultaneously in progress. Each issue bears a consecutive issue number. The Old Series consists of 265 issues; in the New Series, till November, 1923 inclusive, 1459 issues have been published. These 1724 issues represent 237 different works; these works again represent the following literatures:\n\nSanskrit, Prakrit.\nR\u0101jasth\u0101ni, K\u0101shmiri, Hindi.\nTibetan.\nArabic, Persian.\n\nSeveral works published are partly or wholly sold out. Others are still incomplete and in progress. A few works, though incomplete, have been discontinued.\n\nVarious price lists and notices concerning the Bibliotheca Indica are available and may be had on application.

INDEX OF WORDS.\n\nThis index of words, which, to a certain degree at least, replaces the commentary, for an edition of which no sufficient manuscript materials were available, comprises in the first place those words, that are new in Baudh\u0101yana or known hitherto from later texts or from the grammarians only. It contains also those words, which, it is true, are known well enough, but for which the bh\u0101\u1e63yas give an explanation that I thought it worth while to mention. All the references in the aup\u0101\u015buv\u0101kya pra\u015bna (pra\u015bna XIV) to previous parts of the S\u016btra are to be found also in this index. Many words have, moreover, been registered in order to facilitate the finding of the passages referred to in other pra\u015bnas. Wherever no source is indicated, the explanation of a word or of an expression is taken from the vivarana of Bhavasv\u0101min, which is known to me only for pra\u015bnas I\u2014XIV (incl.), the atir\u0101\u1e6da, the ek\u0101da\u015bin\u012b, the sautr\u0101ma\u1e47i, the aptory\u0101ma and the dvaidha and karm\u0101nta pra\u015bnas. For the pr\u0101ya\u015bcitta pra\u015bnas the vivarana of Gop\u0101la has been consulted. Ke\u015b. means the prayogas\u0101ra of Ke\u015bavasv\u0101min; S\u0101y. the bh\u0101\u1e63ya of S\u0101ya\u1e47a on pra\u015bna I and on the corresponding dvaidha and karm\u0101nta passages; MS. the mah\u0101gnisarvasva, an excellent bh\u0101\u1e63ya on the agnipra\u015bna (X) and on the ek\u0101da\u015bin\u012b-s\u016btra; Ve\u1e45k. designates the bh\u0101\u1e63ya of Ve\u1e45kate\u015bvara (I.O. 776. a) extant only for the first 21 ka\u1e47\u1e0dik\u0101s of the first karm\u0101nta-pra\u015bna.\n\n\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 |\n\n\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 II. 11 : 52. 4. \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 |\n\n\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 VI. 10 : 166. 12. \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 |\n\n\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 VI. 22 : 182. 11 ; VI. 23 : 182. 21 ; VI. 27 : 190. 7 ; X 23 : 21. 11 ; X. 26 : 25. 10.\n\n\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 II. 3 : 36. 13. \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 |\n\n\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 (?)

But, as no conclusive investigations have yet been made regarding the chronological sequence of the majority of these texts, it will, for the present, be advisable to treat of them in alphabetic order.\n\n1. The K\u0101\u1e6dha texts. Of this group two Samhit\u0101s are known, that of the Kapisthalakathas and that of the C\u0101r\u0101yan\u012bya- or Caraka-k\u0101\u1e6dhas.\n\n(a) The Kapisthalakathas. We know only of their Samhit\u0101, of which a large fragment is preserved at the Benares Government Library. This Samhit\u0101 is very nearly related to the K\u0101\u1e6dhaka as printed by L. von Schroeder (see under b). The two Samhit\u0101s, differ, first, in many minor points, and secondly in their division, the Kapisthalasamhit\u0101 being divided into A\u1e63\u1e6dakas, each A\u1e63\u1e6daka containing eight Adhy\u0101yas. It is a task for the future to examine the relation of this Samhit\u0101 to the K\u0101\u1e6dhaka.\n\n(b) The Caraka- or C\u0101r\u0101yan\u012bya-k\u0101\u1e6dhas. Their Samhit\u0101 is the one which has been published by L. von Schroeder in three volumes: K\u0101\u1e6dhakam, die Samhit\u0101 der K\u0101\u1e6dha-\u00e7\u0101kh\u0101 (Leipsic, Brockhaus, 1900, 1909, 1910). To this text R. Simon composed a very useful Index Verborum (Leipsic, Brockhaus, 1912). But the K\u0101\u1e6dhaka must once have contained much more than is handed down to us; there must have existed a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a and an \u0100ranyak\u0101. Of this Br\u0101hma\u1e47a only some fragments are known at present. Cp. my paper: \u201cBr\u0101hma\u1e47a- en S\u016btra-aanwinsten\u201d in Versl. en Meded. der Kon. Akad. v. Wet., Afd. Lett., Ve R., IVe deel, page 467 ff. Of the \u0100ranyak\u0101, von Schroeder himself has published many fragments in his paper: \u201cDie T\u00fcbinger K\u0101\u1e6dha Hss.\u201d in Sitz. Ber. der Kais. Ak. der Wiss., Wien, Phil. hist. Kl., Band CXXXVII (1898). From the S\u016btras of the Kathas the Yaj\u00f1as\u016btra (or Vait\u0101nika- or \u015arauta-s\u016btra) seems to have perished (perhaps somewhere in Ka\u015bmir copies still\nmay be extant); only an extensive fragment of the Paribhasa s\u016btra and of the Sulba-s\u016btra are known to me; the Grhya-s\u016btra, however, is preserved and is actually being printed at Lahore with extracts from three commentaries. This Grhya-s\u016btra presupposes a special collection of Mantras, a kind of Mantrasamhit\u0101, in which the Mantras were handed down with their accents, cp. the above-mentioned paper \"Br\u0101hma\u1e47en S\u016btra-aanwinsten,\" page 465 ff.; as a whole this text seems to have perished.\n\n2. The Maitr\u0101ya\u1e47\u012byas or M\u0101navamaitr\u0101ya\u1e47\u012byas. Their Samhit\u0101 has been published by L. von Schroeder in four parts: Maitr\u0101ya\u1e47i \u015aamhit\u0101, Brockhaus, Leipsic, 1881, 1883, 1885, 1886. But this \u015b\u0101kh\u0101 must equally have possessed an \u0100ranyak\u0101, which has been lost. The S\u016btra has partly been edited by F. Knauer: \"Das M\u0101navasrautas\u016btra,\" St. Petersburg, 1900, 1901, 1903, giving Books I\u2014V. After the lamented death of Knauer the task undertaken by him has been taken up by Miss Dr. J. van Gelder, who published the Cayanaprasna (\"Opbouw van het hoogaltaar naar de overlevering der M\u0101navas,\" printed by Kreysing, Leipsic, 1921). The Grhya-s\u016btra of the M\u0101navas has equally been published by Knauer (St. Petersburg, 1897). Whether the V\u0101r\u0101hagryhas\u016btra (edited by R. Sama Sastry as No. XVIII of the Gaekwad's Oriental Series, Central Library, Baroda, 1921) presupposes our Maitr\u0101ya\u1e47i-samhit\u0101 (the V\u0101r\u0101has constituting in this case a cara\u1e47a), or another Samhit\u0101 slightly differing from the one published by von Schroeder (the V\u0101r\u0101has constituting in this case a \u015b\u0101kh\u0101), is for the moment undecided. According to the introduction to this text the \u015arautas\u016btra of these V\u0101r\u0101has has also been found. It is to be hoped that it may also be made publici juris.\n\n3. The Taittir\u012byas. Their Samhit\u0101 appeared in the Bibliotheca Indica under the title: The Samhit\u0101 of the Black Yajurveda with the commentary of M\u0101dhavac\u0101rya (ed. Roer and Cowell, Calcutta, 1860-1899) in five volumes. Their Br\u0101hma\u1e47a is contained in the same collection of edita (the Taittiriyabrahma\u1e47a of the Black Yajurveda, Calcutta, 1859 etc.) in three volumes, as also their \u0100ranyak\u0101 (Calcutta, 1872). Samhit\u0101 and Br\u0101hma\u1e47a were also published at Poona and Mysore with the commentary of Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da Bh\u0101skarami\u015bra. The best critical edition of the Samhit\u0101 is that of A. Weber (published as Volumes XI and XII of the Indische Studien, Brockhaus, Leipsic, 1871, 1872). Since 1914 we possess a translation with ample introduction by A. B. Keith: \"The Veda of the Black Yajus school entitled Taittir\u012byasamhit\u0101\" (Cambridge Mass., 1914) in two volumes.\n\nAccording to Mah\u0101deva in his introduction to the Vaijay-\nanti (i.e. an edition of the text of Hiranyake\u015bi-\u015brautas\u016btra with commentary) the Taittiriyas are divided into six schools (cara\u1e47as), that of (a) the Baudh\u0101yaniyas, (b) the Bh\u0101radv\u0101jins, (c) the \u0100pastambins, (d) the Hairanyakasas, (e) the V\u0101dhulas and (f) the Vaikh\u0101nasas.\n\n(a) Of Baudh\u0101yana the \u015arautas\u016btra is known, now printed; the Grhyas\u016btra lies before us in two editions both uncritical and calling for better work: (1) Baudh\u0101yana-sm\u1e5btas\u016btra (containing the Grhya-, the Pit\u1e5bmedha-, the Pravara- and the Dharma-s\u016btras), Madras, 1905, in Grantha, (2) Baudh\u0101yana-grhyas\u016btra, Mysore, 1904 (no. 32 of the Government Oriental Library Series). The Pit\u1e5bmedha-s\u016btra of Baudh\u0101yana has appeared separately in a work: The Pit\u1e5bmedhas\u016btras of Baudh\u0101yana, Hiranyakas\u012bn, Gautama, by W. Caland (Abh. f. d. Kunde des Morgenl. X. Band, Leipsic, Brockhaus, 1896), whilst under the title: \u201cBijdrage tot de Kennis van het hindoesche doodenritueel\u201d Miss Dr. Raabe published the second and third pra\u015bna of this text (Leiden, Brill, 1911). From the Grhyas\u016btra selections were published and translated by Dr. P. Harting, Valkhoff, Amersfoort, 1922. The Dharmas\u016btra was published twice by A. Hultzsch: Abh. f. d. Kunde des Morgenl. VIII. Band, Leipsic, 1884 and ib. XVI. Band, Leipsic, 1922 (Brockhaus). It is contained also in the Government Oriental Library Series of Mysore with the commentary of Govindasa\u1e43in, Mysore, 1907. An excellent translation was given by G. B\u00fchler in Sacred Books of the East, Volume XIV, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1882. Of the minor texts which help us to understand Baudh\u0101yana there may be mentioned here the \u015ar\u0101tapad\u0101rthanirvacanam, Benares, Samvat 1944, and Ve\u1e45kate\u015ba\u2019s Saninayaprayogam\u0101l\u0101 in three parts, Bombay, \u015aaka 1808.\n\n(b) Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja\u2019s \u015arautas\u016btra is extant in Europe (a large fragment only) in a Munich and a Berlin ms.; whether complete mss. are extant in India is unknown to me. The Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja-grhyas\u016btra has been published by Miss Dr. H. Salomons: Het hindoesche huisritueel volgens de School van Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja, Leiden, Brill, 1913.\n\n(c) The \u0100pastamba-\u015brautas\u016btra is known from the excellent edition by R. Garbe in the Bibliotheca Indica, 1882-1902, with the commentary of Rudradatta for the first two volumes. The first seven books have been translated into German by me and are printed at G\u00f6ttingen, Vandenhoeck and Ruprecht, 1921. The second volume, comprising the translation of Books VIII\u2014XV, is in the press, to appear at Amsterdam; the last volume is nearly ready for printing.\nM. Winternitz published in 1887 the \u0100pastambiya Grhya-s\u016btra with extracts from the commentaries of Haradatta and Sudar\u015ban\u0101rya (Vienna, Holder); it was translated by Oldenberg in Sacred Books of the East, Volume XXX. This S\u016btra presupposes a collection of Mantras, the Mantrap\u0101tha, which was edited by M. Winternitz: The Mantrap\u0101tha or the Prayer Book of the \u0100pastambins, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1897. The Dharmas\u016btra has been published by G. B\u00fchler: \"Aphorisms on the Sacred Law of the Hindus by \u0100pastamba,\" Benares, Government Central Book Depot, 1892, and translated by the same scholar in Volume II of the Sacred Books of the East (1879).\n\n(d) As to the texts of Hiranyakesin, the complete corpus of the ritus according to this school is accessible, partly in ms., partly in print. The \u015arautas\u016btra is known from an excellent ms. at Munich, whilst the first ten pra\u1e47as are printed, together with the commentary of Mah\u0101deva, called Vaijayanti, in the \u0100nand\u0101\u015brama Series, no. 53, 1907. For the Pitmedhas\u016btra, cp. under Baudh\u0101yana. The Grhya-s\u016btra has been edited by J. Kirste with extracts from the commentary of M\u0101trdatta, Vienna, 1889, Holder. It was translated by Oldenberg in Volume XXX of the Sacred Book of the East. For the Dharmas\u016btra, which differs but little from that of \u0100pastamba, B\u00fchler's edition of the \u0100pastamba-dharmas\u016btra is to be compared. In the Samsk\u0101raratanam\u0101l\u0101 (\u0100nand\u0101\u015brama Series, no. 39, 1899) the whole Grhya-ritual is incorporated.\n\n(e) About the V\u0101dh\u016blas, which according to Mah\u0101deva now follow, two or three years ago nothing was known besides the name and a few quotations in the Vaijayanti. At present a very extensive portion of their \u015arautas\u016btra is known to us as also a Vy\u0101khy\u0101, not only of the \u015arauta-, but also of the non-extant Grhya-s\u016btra. See on these texts my two papers in \"Acta Orientalia\" edid. Societates Orientales Batava Danica Norwegica, Vol. I, page 3 and Vol. II, page 142. In Madras, where these texts were unearthed by the Pandits, a copy of the Sm\u1e5bti of the V\u0101dh\u016blas has been discovered.\n\n(f) The last place in the list of the Taittirya-s\u016btra-k\u0101ras is occupied by the Vaikh\u0101nasas. Their \u015arautas\u016btra was at first known to Europeans from a bad copy at Munich, but we now possess a much better ms. from Madras, which however, is probably not complete, as the description of the R\u0101jas\u016bya, the \u0100\u015bvamedha, the Ek\u0101has Ahinas and Sattras is wanting. A Vy\u0101khy\u0101 of the first ten pra\u1e47as of the \u015arauta-s\u016btra by \u015ar\u012bniv\u0101sadik\u1e63ita is in my possession. The remarkable Grhya-s\u016btra together with the Dharmas\u016btra of the\nVaikh\u0101nasyas has been printed in India at Kumbhakonam in 1914. There exists an excellent commentary on this text, composed by N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha\u1e47icit. To this Grhyas\u016btra the Vaikh\u0101nasy\u0101-samhit\u0101, of which the first four pra\u015bnas, with accents, are published likewise at Kumbhakonam in Grantha, stands in the same relation as the Grhyas\u016btra of \u0100pastamba to the Mantrap\u0101\u1e6dha. A complete or nearly complete text of this remarkable Samhit\u0101 is preserved in the Government Oriental Library at Mysore.\nBAUDHAYANA \u015aRAUTA S\u016aTRAM.\n\nPROGRESS AND COLLATION STATEMENT FOR LIBRARIANS.\n\nVol. I.\n\nFasc.
