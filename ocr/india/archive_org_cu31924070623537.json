Exclusive of the Ran, it contains an estimated area of 6500 square miles, a population of 487,305 souls, or 74\u00b797 to the square mile, and yields a yearly revenue of about \u00a3260,000 (Rs. 26,00,000).\n\nA belt of land, 160 miles from east to west and from thirty-five to seventy from north to south, Cutch is almost entirely cut off from the continent of India, on the north and east by the Ran, on the south by the gulf of Cutch, and on the west by the Arabian sea and the eastern or Kori mouth of the river Indus. From its isolated position, the special character of its people, their peculiar dialect, and their strong feeling of personal loyalty to their ruler, the peninsula of Cutch has more of the elements of a distinct nationality than any other of the dependencies of the Bombay Government.\n\nThe territory of Cutch has as shown in the margin a threefold jurisdiction; the first comprises the state, khalsa, portion under the direct management of His Highness the Rao; the second are the estates of the Bhayad or cadets of the Rao's house, a body of feudal landlords; the third, seven villages scattered over the centre of the province.\n\nAdministrative Sub-divisions.\n\n| Jurisdiction          | Number of Villages | Population |\n|-----------------------|--------------------|------------|\n| His Highness the Rao  | 629                | 302,656    |\n| Smaller Chiefs        | 400                | 177,932    |\n| Morvi Thakor          | 7                  | 6714       |\n| Total                 | 1035               | 487,305    |\n\n1 Besides to marshes and lowlands the Sanskrit Kachchh is applied to river banks and coast tracts. Lassen Indische Alterthumskunde, I. 132, note 5.\n2 This includes the incomes of the smaller chiefs. In 1878 the estimated total revenue was \u00a3266,062 (Rs. 26,60,620).\nChapter I.\n\nDescription.\n\nDivisions.\n\nknown as the Adhoi sub-division and held by one of the leading chiefs of the R\u00e1o's tribe, the Th\u00e1kor of Morvi in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r.\n\nThe total area of the province is, for administrative purposes, distributed over eight sub-divisions with an average area of 812 square miles, containing on an average the lands of 129 villages and a population of about 60,000 souls. The following summary gives the chief statistics of each of these sub-divisions:\n\n| Sub-Divisions | Villages | Area | Population | Revenue |\n|---------------|----------|------|------------|---------|\n|               | State    | Alienated | Smaller Chiefs | Total |          |\n| Abd\u00e1sa with Nakhtr\u00e1na | 43 | 33 | 18 | 200 | 294 | 1525 | 117,530 | \u00a332,776 |\n| Anj\u00e1r         | 74 | 5 | 2 | 5 | 86 | 420 | 48,800 | 38,678 |\n| Bhach\u00e1u       | 30 | 3 | ... | 30 | .63 | 475 | 42,990 | 27,786 |\n| Bhuj with Kh\u00e1vda | 134 | 25 | 34 | 12 | 205 | 1400 | 49,500 | 25,346 |\n| Lakhpat       | 40 | 22 | 19 | 39 | 120 | 810 | 18,500 | 7210 |\n| M\u00e1ndvi        | 35 | 10 | 5 | 46 | 96 | 515 | 96,825 | 83,800 |\n| Mundra        | 34 | 11 | 10 | 18 | 73 | 390 | 46,200 | 27,512 |\n| R\u00e1par with Khadir | 42 | 5 | 1 | 50 | 98 | 965 | 66,960 | 22,955 |\n| Total         | 432 | 114 | 89 | 400 | 1035 | 6500 | 487,305 | 266,063 |\n\nPopularly the province is divided into seven districts; P\u00e1var said to be the original seat of the K\u00e1this along the southern margin of the Ran, and bounded on the south by the Ch\u00e1rvad range of hills; Garda Pathak between P\u00e1var and the Kori river; Abd\u00e1sa named from J\u00e1m Abda between the Ch\u00e1rvad range and the Arabian sea; Kunda a small district in the extreme west; K\u00e1ntha or K\u00e1nthi, along the south coast; Miy\u00e1ni east of P\u00e1var, taking its name from the Miy\u00e1na tribe; and V\u00e1gad, occupying the peninsula in the east.\n\nAspect.\n\nFrom the sea on the south and west, and from the Ran on the north and east, the coast of Cutch is in some places very slightly raised and fringed with mangrove swamps. In other parts it rises in rows of sand hills, or as in the north-west, in broken rocky cliffs. Inland, especially on the south and east, are broad plains some deep soiled and well tilled, others bare and furrowed with water-courses. Beyond these plains rise the central lands of the province, in places relieved by bright coloured rocks and patches of tillage, but over most of the area brown waving uplands deep in loose sand, broken by naked peaks, and bordered by bare ridges of low dust-coloured hills.\n\n1 Burgess's Archaeological Report, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r and Cutch, 189.\nThe rock formations of Cutch have been thus sub-divided:\n\n| FORMATION          | SUB-DIVISION                                      | PERIOD                  |\n|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Recent             | Alluvium, blown sand and sub-recent deposits      | Pleistocene              |\n|                    | Upper Tertiary (unconformity)                     | Probably both Pleistocene and Miocene |\n| Tertiary           | Argillaceous Group (Fossiliferous)                | Miocene or Upper Eocene  |\n|                    | Arenaceous Group                                  |                         |\n|                    | Nummulitic Group                                  |                         |\n|                    | Gypseous Shales                                   |                         |\n|                    | Sub-Nummulitic                                    | Eocene                  |\n|                    | Stratified Traps and Associated Intertrappean Beds|                         |\n| Volcanic Tertiary  | Infra-Trappean Grits (unconformity)               |                         |\n| Jurassic           | Upper Jurassic Group                              | Oolitic                 |\n|                    | Lower Jurassic Group                              |                         |\n| Metamorphic Crystaline | Syenite                          |                         |\n| Trappean           | Intrusive Traps                                   |                         |\n\nThe examination of these rocks seems to show that at some very early time metamorphic rocks were exposed and worn away till they were covered with water. In this water, an arm of the sea not far from the mouths of rivers, shales and sandstones were laid. The sea at first deep, gradually shoaled till the rocks, at least in places, rose above the water. Then, forcing its way through many fissures, trap, some of it on land but most under the water covered the shales and sandstones. These outbursts of trap lasted through long periods of time, some of the later being widely different from the earlier flows. After the outbursts of trap the land sank, and, under the sea, beds of limestone and marl were found at first under a deep sea, then under gradually shoaler water full of life and not far from the land. Of the next changes the only traces are the wearing away of some of the surface rocks and the forming of new beds shore-like and comparatively late. Last of all are the surface rocks with little to show how they were formed.\n\nThe presence of crystalline rocks in Nagar P\u00e1kar on the north shore of the Ran, and of schistose rocks in K\u00e1thi\u00e1war, seems to show that metamorphic rocks stretch below the Ran and Cutch and support the secondary and newer formations.\n\nJurassic is the most largely developed of Cutch formations. Though with much general likeness and with no well-marked boundary line, these rocks differ enough to allow of their division into an Upper and a Lower group. Of these the Lower Jurassic\n\n---\n\n1 This section is condensed from Mr. A. B. Wynne's Memoir on the Geology of Cutch, Mem. Geol. Sur. IX.\n2 The terms Upper and Lower are purely local. They have nothing to do with the 'Upper' and 'Lower' divisions of Jurassic rocks in Europe and elsewhere. Later inquiry has divided the Jurassic series into four groups, three of lower marine Pacham, Chari, and Katrol, and the fourth Unica the uppermost marine and the fresh-water beds. For details see Manual of Geology of India, 250-265.\nbeds are chiefly found in four places; 1, A belt from one to twelve and generally about six miles broad, lying along the north of Cutch from Lakhpat in the west to a little beyond where the Banni peninsula joins the mainland. This, especially in the west, is much broken by trap intrusions; 2, About the middle of Cutch, divided into two nearly equal parts by the M\u00e1ndvi-Bhuj road, a belt forty miles long and from one to five miles broad; 3, In the east in V\u00e1gad, a large stretch of country, about forty miles from east to west and fourteen from north to south; 4, Except a little alluvium and a narrow strip of nummulitic beds the whole of the Ran islands. The Lower Jurassic rocks have large clayey beds that, as they weather, give their hills rusty orange tints. Among them are hard blue and gray quartzose layers; strong sandstone, cream coloured, gray, blue, and black; gypseous shales, covering the ground with small red ferruginous nodules; buff, orange, blue, and gray close earthy limestones; then bands of lumpy conglomerate-like shale, and layers of shelly limestone. One very peculiar rock is a coarse-grained, golden, sometimes fossil-yielding oolite, the grains coated with a thin film of lustrous brown h\u00e6matite. Ferruginous beds except of the nodular sort are rarer than they are higher in the formation. In many places igneous rocks come through the lower Jurassics. Sometimes the Jurassic and the igneous rocks seem to have been laid one over the other. But the effect is probably due to the igneous rocks forcing their way between two Jurassic beds. Of the life of the period when they were formed, the lower Jurassic rocks preserve many grass-like impressions and some fragments of fossil wood, but, except in the extreme west, no traces of land animal life, pal\u00e6ozamie. Of sea animal remains there is a large store, including Trigonia, Astarte, Gryphaea, Terebratula, Ostrea, Cucullea, and many Ammonites, some of great size; some Pleurotomaria, Chemnitzia, and a few more univalves; remains of echinoderms, corals, fish teeth, reptile bones, and quantities of Belemnites.\n\nSouth of the first belt of Lower Jurassic rocks, and including the second belt, the Upper Jurassics stretch for about 120 miles east and west with a breadth varying from one to twenty and averaging about ten miles. They also appear over small detached areas in the east of V\u00e1gad. The characteristic beds of the upper group are coarse white sandstone, gravel and conglomerate, and layers of coarse sand and mud with crisp biscuit-like ferruginous partings. In many places these rocks are so salt as strongly to taste the wells and streams. Of the life of the period when the Upper Jurassic rocks were formed there remain in a few gray and white shales matted impressions of Zamia, ferns, mosses, and other land plants without a fragment of any sea form. Once or twice in the lower beds the vegetable remains have gathered into seams of coal with brilliant facets, but much mixed with carbonaceous shale and not of workable thickness. Of animal remains there are in the west a few sea shells of interest from their relation to some south African shells. The upper layers, crowded in places with fossil land plants, seem to shew that the rocks were formed at the foot of lakes. But\nthese land plants may have been washed down into river mouths and lagoons, whose half-fresh water was ill-suited to the growth of sea plants. With this exception the evidence seems to show that the rocks were formed under the sea without any marked changes of condition. Igneous rocks have in many places, and with the greatest irregularity, been thrust through the Upper Jurassics, burning gray shales black, red, or dark olive, and sandstones white and flinty. Some hand specimens have trap on one side and sandstone on the other, while in others the sandstone has completely fused into the trap. As neither the base nor the uppermost limit of the Jurassic rocks can be seen their depth is unknown. The estimate is for the Upper and for the Lower rocks a thickness of about 3000 feet each.\n\nAbout ten miles south of Bhuj, and at the east end of the chief Jurassic belt, Infra Trappean Grits form a fringe between the Jurassic rocks and the Stratified Traps. In other places, as in the west near L\u00e1kha hill, they are found in separate patches. A peculiar soft, loosely-grained, and dimly stratified group of earthy and sandy rocks weathering greenish, orange, or dark, the Infra Trappean Grits are probably a local deposit of the lower Stratified Traps. Though not ashy the group is closely connected with the early volcanic flows. The bed is seldom 200 feet thick.\n\nStratified Traps cover great part of Cutch. They form all the hilly ground in the south stretching along the whole length of the main Upper Jurassic area from Anj\u00e1r to the west. In the east and south the belt of Stratified Trap is regular, varying from five to eight miles in breadth. Along the south-west it is an irregular strip, from one to fourteen miles broad, sometimes cut right across by nummulitic and Upper Jurassic inliers. In the west, where it ends in the Garda hills, it spreads over an area of about twelve miles by twenty. The beds of flows, resting on the Jurassic rocks with complete unconformity are of the usual Deccan gray, greenish-olive, and dark doleritic and basaltic trap. Of the same construction the Cutch beds differ from the Deccan beds in being less than half as thick; and in having many fewer dykes and an upper surface more conformable to the overlying tertiary rocks. As in the Deccan there are no traces of old volcanic cones. In Mr. Wynne's opinion the Cutch traps were formed mostly under water, the materials rising through numerous small outlets.\n\nTrap intrusions are almost confined to the Jurassic area. There they appear in great numbers, the chief of them being in the north-west, a narrow irregular band, running about twenty miles from L\u00e1kha hill in the west to Majal hill in the east. Then eight miles south-east of Majal hill, Kira hill; twelve miles more, Dhinodhar; eight miles more, a belt running about fifteen miles north-east and south-west; and twelve miles south, Nan\u00e1ma hill and beds stretching eight miles south-east. Further east there are few trap inliers. The chief are Vad\u00e1i hill about ten miles north-east and Kirgiria eight miles south of Bhuj, Bh\u00e1njda rock at the north-west point of Khadir and a few inliers in the Bela\nand Chor\u00e1d islands. They include nearly all varieties of doleritic, trachytic, and basaltic traps, crystalline, compact or porphyritic, seldom amygdaloidal, sometimes columnar, and often so friable and ready to weather away that no clean fracture can be obtained. There seems little doubt that, through channels like these, the upper stratified trap found its way to the surface, and that these intrusive traps are some of the latest eruptions. In forcing their way through the Jurassic rocks, the traps have, in many places, become a tangled net-work of dykes and intrusions. In other places they have formed cones the mass of the cone Jurassic and the top trap. By contact with the traps whole beds of Jurassic rock have been made much more splintery, darker, and more like trap. Some places have many dykes, but none are known in the purely aqueous tertiary rocks.\n\nSub-Nummulites.\n\nOverlying the stratified traps, and usually resting on a crystalline concretionary amygdaloidal flow, is a singularly mixed and varied band of rocks. To the west and south it forms a fringe between the stratified traps, and the nummulitic and argillaceous tertiaries. It is seldom found to the east of the main beds of stratified traps. But it again appears near Bhach\u00e1n, in V\u00e1gad, and on the south and south-eastern sides of the Ran islands. The group is beautifully varied in texture and colour. It includes pale purple concretionary unctuous aluminous rocks; strong red and mottled laterites sometimes with agates; coarse sandstones, red or brown gypseous, and dark aluminous or white sandy shales. Short of absolute intercalation this group presents many appearances of conformity to the traps. The laterites are earthy compact or nodular and scoriaceous, sometimes so highly ferruginous as to become an iron ore formerly used in making iron. In eastern Cutch the laterites and white beds form nearly all that is seen of the group. Here they yield rapidly to atmospheric action, the ground weathering into hillocks like the wasteheaps of a foundry. In other places wide-swelling plains are sheeted over with a hardened laterite crust, the surface sometimes covered with a coating of agates. Thicker in the north and east than in the south of the district, the band varies from twenty to 200 feet. It rarely has fossils.\n\nGypseous Shales.\n\nOf Tertiary rocks there are several groups beginning from below, gypseous shales, nummulitic rocks, an arenaceous group, an argillaceous group, and upper tertiaries. The gypseous shales are found beneath the nummulitic group round the western curve of the beds that flank the Garda hills and in a few other places. Its nodular clay stone and marl bands, and some of the shales are full of little *nummulites* and *orbiculina*, and also have bones, reptile remains, fish vertebrae, and teeth. The band varies in thickness from fifty to 150 feet.\n\nNummulitic Group.\n\nThe nummulitic rocks are found almost entirely in the west, stretching, a belt from three to six miles broad, along the outer edge of the gypseous shales. To the east they disappear with much obscurity, slight patches showing far to the east and south-east. They are of pale yellow and white marly impure limestone with\nsome sandy beds and shaly marls. Several kinds of nummulites abound. At the period when nummulites ceased corals seem to have flourished, large coral masses being found wherever there are upper beds. The isolated and flat-topped hill of G\u00e1diapadar near Khudi five miles south of N\u00e1r\u00e1yansar is probably an old coral reef.\n\nThe arenaceous beds, a group of very little importance, are found in the west on the skirts of the nummulitic rocks, and in the south bordering on the sub-nummulitic rocks. It is characterized by very irregular and false-bedded sand or friable sandy shales generally white and streaked by iron-stained laminae. These rest on dim-coloured and blue finely laminated clays in which only a few fossils and the carapace of a very small crab were found.\n\nThe argillaceous group, in thickness and extent by far the most important of the Cutch tertiary deposits, starting in the extreme west stretches south and east for about 120 miles ending close to the line of the Bhuj-M\u00e1ndvi road. During the first sixty miles it skirts the nummulitic rocks in a belt varying from three to six miles in breadth, then for about twelve miles it broadens to thirteen miles and again narrows fringing, during the last twenty miles, the sub-nummulitic group. Among the lowest argillaceous beds are some much like the upper portions of the arenaceous sub-division. There are also strongly ferruginous or lateritic bands and soft brown yellow and mottled sandstones. This group is very rich in the number and variety of its fossils. Turritellae with Corbulae and Venus granosa occur abundantly in one or two of the ferruginous bands. And as one or two large bones and two fine molars of a bilobodont were found in the valley of the Madh river, it is probable that some of the nodular and ferruginous beds represent those of Piram island in the gulf of Cambay. Above the lowest beds are calcareous grits and sandstones with rather few fossils. Above them a large thickness of shales, clays, and marly beds with thin disc-shaped Nummulites and other Foraminifera. Above the shales come yellow marls and marly limestone very full of fossils, some of the hard muddy beds being almost entirely made of fossil shells. Above the marls are soft sandy clays and muddy shales with a few compact sandstone layers thinly laminated and ripple-marked and a narrow band largely made of fragmentary shells. Higher up the beds contain bored clay nodules resembling pebbles and Bryozoa encrusting the shells of Pectens and oysters.\n\nBefore the upper tertiaries were deposited the higher argillaceous beds were in many places removed by denudation. At the base of the upper tertiaries is a conglomerate, in places more or less ferruginous, but of no great thickness. This is succeeded by thickbedded brown sands or incoherent sandstones, parts of which near the base are cemented by carbonate of lime. Calcareous segregations occur throughout the rock. The only organic remains discovered were a few large logs of fossil timber. The upper members of the group are ill defined.\n\nThe alluvium is the result of the degradation of the local rocks. As most of it overlies the tertiary beds, it consists largely of materials derived from them, often mixed with fragments brought\nby rivers from the hills. Much of it, as a limestone or mottled clay deposit with red blotches and quartz grains, resembles a newer tertiary stratum. A sub-recent calcareous deposit is very generally distributed over the hilly country. Its calcareous sandstones are sometimes coherent enough for building, and it is commonly burned for lime. No fossils have been found in it. Along the coast are dunes or moving sand hills. Nothing seen in Cutch helps to settle the question of the formation of the western India alluvial coast plains. The materials are often, but not always, of fine grain. Sometimes near the surface are a few land shells, but no sea remains have been found. The deposits are often like river deposits, though there are now no rivers in Cutch that could have formed them. The alluvium may be marine. But there are no fossils to prove this, and the ground is less level than the Ran and less uneven than the bottom of the neighbouring sea.\n\nIts hills, though of no great height, are one of the chief natural features of Cutch. They may be divided into three groups, the hills of Cutch proper, of V\u00e1gad in the east, and of the Ran islands in the north. Nearly all the ranges and many of the hills are steep, scarped on the north slope gently towards the south. Most of the beds have long southerly slopes at right angles to three parallel lines of disturbance; one in the Ran islands from Pachham to Chor\u00e1d; a second along the north of Cutch from Lakhpat near V\u00e1gad; and a third in the central uplands from Roha to Bhach\u00e1u. Except one range running north-west from the Dhola hills, with long slopes upon the dip and steep slopes along the outcrop of the beds, the trap hills, particularly those formed of intrusive trap, are often sharp peaked or cliff-girt. In Cutch proper the hills, widely spread over its western parts, gradually narrow eastwards into a single range. Though none of great height, the highest, Dhinodhar only a little over 1000 feet above the Ran, several of them are from some peculiarity of shape or make worthy of notice. In the south-west about five miles south of N\u00e1r\u00e1yansar is G\u00e1dipadar, a conspicuous, 100 feet high, flat-topped hill, a mass of limestone below and at the top almost entirely coral. The Garda hills, the broad west end of the central range of stratified trap, though they rise high, have no peaks of special interest. Among the Jurassic hills to the north is G\u00e1ndhri, 534 feet above the plain, steep on all sides and faced by a bold cliff, the body of the hill of white and purple sandstone, and its peak of basalt and softer trap. Further east about twenty-four miles north-west of Bhuj is Dhinodhar, the fabulous Cutch volcano. This, one of the highest hills in the province, 1073 feet above the Ran, is chiefly of coarse and fine white sandstone with a basalt capping 180 feet thick. About ten miles north-east is Jhura, 890 feet above the Ran, chiefly of shale and limestone; V\u00e1r\u00e1r about five miles south, an isolated tabular steep-sided hill, rising 894 feet above the plain, is of sandstone with a thick capping of black columnar basalt, and four miles to the west is Vichlia a far-seen conical peak of sandstone covered by trap. About seven miles east of Bhuj is the bold sub-conical steepsided sandstone hill of Jandharia, rising about 700 feet above the Ran;\nand about six miles north of Jandharia, in the Lod\u00e1i and Jhuran range, Halm\u00e1n, a sandstone hill about 800 feet above the Ran. In the central or Chor\u00e1d hills there is in the east, Kh\u00e1trod, a conical peak with a steep north escarpment rising 550 feet above the plain. At the west end of the range, rising 400 feet above the plain is Dhrebva, a steep flat-topped hill of trap-covered sandstone, and a little to the south-west Nan\u00e1ma, probably the source of some of the neighbouring stratified traps, a nearly circular dome-shaped mass of trap, 770 feet above the plain and 3\u00bd miles round at the base. The more regular range of the south, or Dhola, hills has no peak of special interest.\n\nThe V\u00e1gad hills, a broad group stretching east and west, have many separate peaks, the chief of them Adhoi, rising 270 feet from its base, sandstone-capped with white beds strikingly like metamorphic quartzite.\n\nOf the hills that rise out of the Ran some details are given under the head \u2018Islands.\u2019 Pachham, the chief of them, 1437 feet above the Ran, is the highest point in Cutch.\n\nThough many have deep-cut channels with steep much-worn sides, none of the Cutch rivers have water enough to flow throughout the year. Rising in the central uplands they find their way either north to the Ran or south to the gulf of Cutch. Of north-flowing rivers the chief is the Kh\u00e1ri with a course of about thirty miles. Rising in the Chor\u00e1d hills about eight miles south-west of Bhuj, the Kh\u00e1ri flows past Bhuj and from there, between steep banks in places 110 feet high, keeps north for about twelve miles and after receiving the Mithi from the right flows about eight miles more into the Ran. Of south-flowing streams the largest are the Madh and Tera which, with a course of about thirty miles across the Abd\u00e1sa plain, fall together into the gulf of Cutch near Jakh\u00e1u.\n\nBesides its local streams three rivers pass by Cutch on their way to the sea. Of these, two, the Ban\u00e1s in the east from \u00c1bu and P\u00e1l\u00e1npur and the Luni in the north-east from Ajmir and the \u00c1r\u00e1vali hills have, beyond helping to flood the Ran in the rainy season, little connection with Cutch. In the west the Kori or east mouth of the Indus though of little value for trade or irrigation, is of much historic interest. At the time of Alexander (325 B.C.) and of Ptolemy (150 A.D.), under the name of Lonibare it was one of the chief mouths of the Indus. It seems to have continued of equal\n\n---\n\n1 The mountain torrents have generally high and precipitous banks cut deep in the rocks by the rapidity of the current. A traveller may proceed for miles along the banks of these streams without being able to descend to their beds, if he has the misfortune to lose the beaten path. McMurdo (1818), Trans. Bom. Lit. Soc. II. 224, New Ed.\n\n2 There is much confusion about the names of Cutch rivers. Few (1818) have any names, and those few are not generally known in the country. McMurdo, Trans. Bom. Lit. Soc. II. 224, New Ed.\n\n3 Vivien de St. Martin, Geog. Grecque et Latine de l'Inde, 155. According to local story this, known as the old river, was once deep enough to have a port at Sindhi; then shoaling, the port had to be moved down about fourteen miles to Sindu; then sixteen miles to Lakhpat; and lastly twenty more to Kotesvar and N\u00e1r\u00e1yansar. The chief changes are believed to have been due to the moving of the main body of\nimportance with the more western mouths until about 1000, the main stream of the river seems to have turned towards the west. Still, as late as the middle of the eighteenth century, the eastern or Kori branch continued to bring water enough to irrigate a large area of rice-land to the north of Lakhp\u00e1t. Increasing demands on its water by the people of Sind led to feuds between Cutch and Sind. In 1764 at the battle of Jh\u00e1ra the people of Cutch were beaten and soon after Ghul\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h raised so great a bank across the Kori that its stream was nearly stopped and the Lakhp\u00e1t rice-fields were changed into grazing ground. In 1802 a fresh dam was raised at Ali Bandar. This so entirely stopped the flow that even floods could not pass. The channel filling with mud dried above Sindhdi and shoaled at Lakhp\u00e1t, and the old rice-fields, unable to grow even grass, were included in the waste lands of the Ran. For the next sixteen years (1803-1818) except when flooded during the windy and rainy seasons, May-October, the bed of the river, and the part of the Ran through which it flowed, remained dry. The 1819 earthquake made a great change. At Lakhp\u00e1t, where it used to be fordable, the riverbed became eighteen feet deep. Near Sindhu, about sixteen miles further up, from two to six miles of the bed were raised, and again beyond Sindhu the level of the Ran fell, forming a basin about twelve feet deep, and behind the basin right across the bed of the river rose the All\u00e1h Band or God\u2019s dam. At the same time a great wave rushed up the river and filled the basin with salt water. For eight years the channel of the river was closed and except during the season of floods its bed was nearly dry. In 1826 the upper Indus burst its banks, overspread the desert, and clearing every dam before it, burst through the All\u00e1h Band, filled the Sindhdi lake with fresh water and, sweeping the silt, so cleared the Kori bed that boats of 100 tons could pass from the sea to Lakhp\u00e1t. For three years the Kori continued to come down in so large a stream that it was open for trading as far as Amirkot. Meanwhile the Sindhians were rebuilding their dams, and in 1834 the stream was almost stopped. In 1838, except during the rains the channel was dry. For the next thirty-six years (1839-1874) silt kept gathering in the bed of the river below the All\u00e1h Band. In 1856 there was water enough for boats from Sindhdi to the river mouth, and in 1868 a boat could not pass further up than Lakhp\u00e1t. In 1874 there was another flood on the Indus, a large body of water ran through the All\u00e1h Band and filled the Sindhdi lake.\n\nThe Indus waters from the eastern to the western branch. Mem. Geol. Surv. IX. 44. Though other changes are referred to (vide St. M. 159-160) the chief would seem to have been during the 11th or 12th century and was the cause of the destruction of the great city Alor and \u20181000 towns.\u2019 This from an inscription (Jour. Bom. As. Soc. I. 204) must have been later than 953 (341 H.) and must have been some considerable time before the end of the 13th century as before its overthrow by Al\u00e1-md-din Khilji (about 1300) the Sumra dynasty had for long its head quarters at Muhammad Tur. According to the local story Alor was ruined by a merchant who had been defrauded by its ruler and who in revenge raised a great dam and changed the course of the Indus. T\u00e1rikh-i-T\u00e1hiri in Elliot, I. 256-258.\n\nIn January 1875 at the All\u00e1h Band the channel was 70 to 80 feet across, the speed per second 2\u00bd to 4\u00bd feet, and the discharge from 1200 to 1500 cubic feet. The Sindhdi lake was a stretch of clear blue water broken only by the ruined tower of the Sindhdi fort. Major Smith, R.E., quoted by Col. Barton.\nExcept what is found by digging in river-bed sands, the water of Cutch streams is unfit to drink, and during the hot season is too salt even for cattle. In rocks at no great depth from the surface, water is readily found, and many wells from fifteen to forty-five feet deep yield excellent supplies, and in one or two spots it is found almost close to the surface. Irrigation by the Persian wheel is unknown, but by the double-mouthed leather bag it is practised over a large area. The porous upper soil is against the storage of water in ponds and reservoirs. Ponds are not uncommon, but they are of no great size, and for one that holds water during the whole year, twenty run dry in six months.\n\nExcept the special depression at Sindhdi in the west of the Ran, the only lake of any size is in the east of the Charvar range. This, a round valley called the Saror lake about $2\\frac{1}{2}$ miles broad, with a dam thrown across its narrow eastern outlet, is flooded during the rains.\n\nOf the lake at Sindhdi in the west of the gulf of Cutch the chief details have been given in the account of the Kori river. To the north-west of Cutch at the time of Alexander (325 B.C.) there was a great fresh-water sea, and this, though perhaps an estuary rather than a lake, continued till about 1300 years later the Indus left its old eastern channel and the chief part of its waters passed to the western mouths. In 1819 at the time of the earthquake over a large tract north-west of Lakhpat the land sank and became covered with water. At first the lake was salt, but in 1826, the mound that, in 1819, had formed on its north bank, was pierced by the flood waters of the Kori, and the Sindhdi became a fresh water lake. Next year (March 1827) it was a vast fresh-water lake reaching the horizon on all sides with the Sindhdi tower standing out like a rock. In August 1827 the lake was two feet deeper but entirely salt, the fresh stream much smaller in volume, the southwest winds having blown the sea water in on the fresh. In 1834 by the stoppage of the Kori river the lagoon became much like what it was before the 1826 flood. In 1838 it was smaller and shallower, part of it dry. In 1844 the earthquake is said to have made it a salt marsh from one to four feet deep. It would seem to have kept in this state, slowly silting up, till in 1869 in the fair season but little water remained after the rest of the Ran was dry. There were miles of mud and the shape of the hollow could still be traced. In 1874, as in 1826, the Kori river sent a large volume of water through the opening in the All\u00e1h Band, and in May 1875 the whole low land from the All\u00e1h Band to Sindhdi was again an expense of clear blue water broken only by the ruined tower of the Sindhdi fort.\n\nEncircling Cutch on the north and east is the Ran, irina or 'the waste,' a salt desert supposed to cover about 9000 square miles, and\n\n---\n\n1 Mem. Geol. Sur. IX. 177.\n2 In the Bhagvat Pur\u00e1n, a great lake called N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Saras is mentioned as visited only by devotees and Siddhas. This is still a place of pilgrimage, but the great lake has disappeared. V. de St. Martin, 179.\n3 Major Smith, R.E., quoted by Col. Barton.\nbelieved to be the dry bed of an arm of the sea. It is divided into two parts, the great Ran to the north, about 160 miles from east to west and eighty from north to south, stretching over not less than 7000 square miles; and the little Ran to the east about 1600 miles in extent, about eighty miles long from east to west and from ten to forty broad from north to south.\n\nIn appearance and general character the two parts of the Ran differ little. Except the four hilly islands on the south shore of the great Ran and plots of raised land, some of them of considerable size, the whole area is, from April to October the season of strong south winds and occasional rain, frequently flooded to the depth of from one to three feet. Most of this water is salt, either sea water driven by the strong south-west winds up the Kori river or beyond the head of the gulf of Cutch, or land water from the Luni and Ban\u00e1s, or the brackish local streams. In spite of this yearly flooding, the bed of the Ran, except in a few isolated spots, does not become soft or slimy. The flood waters, as they dry, leave a hard flat surface covered with stone, shingle, and salt. As the season wears on, and the heat grows greater, the ground, baked and blistered by the sun, shines over large tracts of salt with dazzling whiteness, and the air, dim and quivering, mocks all distance by an almost ceaseless mirage. Only on some raised rocky lands is water found, and only near water is there brushwood, grass, or any sign of growth. Except a chance bird or herd of wild asses, a stray antelope, or an occasional camel caravan, no sign of life breaks the weary loneliness.\n\nThe lands to the west of the Ran are low-lying and swampy; to the north-west for about fifty miles stretches the level ridge of the Allah Band; along the north are rows of sea-coast-like sandhills; and on the north-east the high cones of the Kalingar hills. On the east the shores are low, and along the south, beyond the row of bluff steep islands, the north coast of Cutch is at first fringed with a narrow belt of low alluvial land, then stretches into the long low Banni peninsula, and lastly from near Nara runs west in a row of capes, cliffs, and promontories. Where the edge is not rocky the Ran stretches inland as the sea stretches along a low-lying coast, fringed sometimes by a belt of grass-yielding land, and in other places passing up the sandy beds of rivers. The margin of the small Ran is low throughout, rich and wet on the south or Kathiawar side, dry and rocky on the north or Vagad side.\n\nThe level bed of the Ran is, in most places, so little lower than the land near it that it is often impossible to say where the main\n\n---\n\n1 The Ran in the east is much affected by the Ban\u00e1s' floods. From A'hu the only drainage line, the Ban\u00e1s brings down great quantities of water covering the Ran over a breadth of eight miles with from six to eight feet of fresh water. The waters keep fresh, because of the strong south-west winds that force them back. Between Jadjam and Pangi the small belt of the river is often deepened four or five feet and is like the bed of a river. Sir A. Burnes, MS. 1828.\n\n2 The Thar, or little desert, along the north edge of the Ran is a succession of such sandhills or dunes as fringe the sea-coast. Their only peculiarity is a succession of little basins of salt water in the hollows between them, and in places, stunted bushes. Mem. Geol. Sur. IX. 28.\nland ends and the Ran begins, and it is so near the sea level that aneroid barometers fail to show any difference. Almost perfectly flat, its surface is in four places slightly depressed, in the Sindhdi basin in the west; along the north; in the south between Pachham and Khadir; and in the south-east near Adesar. The surface and sub-soil are regular layers of sand and clay with a large mixture of salt, which by drawing moisture from the air, in some places damps the surface. In the Sindhdi basin in the west when, as in 1826 and 1874, a flood comes down the Kori river, the Ran is all the year round covered with water. At other times it is flooded only during the season of strong south winds and rain. For about five months in the year (November-March) the whole is, except a few patches, dry, the parts where water has lain longest being deeply crusted with salt. In March when strong westerly winds set in, the water in the gulf of Cutch is heaped up and rises slowly over the Ran until in June rain falls, and almost the whole of the west is from a few inches to a few feet deep in water. Between Khadir and Pachham the depth is seven feet, and between Adesar and Chor\u00e1d still more. Most of the Ran is dry by the end of November or the middle of December, the lowlying Adesar strait dries in January, and some parts along the northern shore and in the Sindhdi basin remain damp throughout the year.\n\nAlong the north coast of Cutch within the limits of the Ran are four islands beginning from the east, Chor\u00e1d, Bela, Khadir, and Pachham.\n\nChor\u00e1d, in the narrows between V\u00e1gad and the mainland, at the north end of the Ran, though politically part of the P\u00e1lanpur Agency, belongs to Cutch chiefs. About twenty miles from north to south and ten from east to west, this island is low in the south, and in the north does not rise more than 150 feet. There is a belt of upper tertiaries in the south, then a stretch of alluvium, and then sub-nummulites with near the north a narrow band of Jurassic rock.\n\nAbout four miles west of Chor\u00e1d lies Bela, stretching north-east and south-west, about twenty-five miles long and ten broad. Low towards the south, it rises near the north into a chain of hills called Nilva, the highest point of which is 617 feet above the Ran. The rocks are sub-nummulitic towards the south and Jurassic in the north. In the Jurassic beds was found a small and fragmentary *palaeo zamia*, the only specimen met with in the east of Cutch.\n\nFive miles west of Bela is Khadir, sloping gradually north and ending sharply in a cliff. Some of the cliffs on the north side are very fine, their tops from 350 to 400 feet above the Ran. They show few traces of having ever been sea coast cliffs.\n\nAbout twelve miles further west lies Pachham, in the middle of the Ran, about fifteen miles from north to south and ten from east to west. It is from east to west crossed by two chains of hills, the black, *k\u00e1la*, range on the north, and the white, *gora*, on the south.\n\n---\n\n1 The local story is that this range was called after a saint, whose face was blackened by the malice of a woman's evil eye. Sir A. Burnes. M.S. 1827.\nIn the black range is Pachham Pir, the highest point in Cutch, 1437 feet above the Ran. The top of the hill commands a wide view. To the north, beyond a waste of salt and water, the P\u00e1\u0301rkar hills; to the south, the dark surface of the Banni and Cutch hills; a salt waste to the west with behind it a dark shadow, perhaps the All\u00e1h Band. The south or white hills, much lower and narrower, are like the black range steep on the north side. The chief rocks in the black range are, at the foot, a fine white and light fossil-bearing flinty sandstone with bands of chalk and slightly ferruginous purple sandy beds with occasional masses of trap; further up coarser sandstone, weathered yellow or brown, with porphyritic dykes. After these are purple and gray shales and white sandstone, massive gray limestone and fine sandstone with a few traces of fossils, purple and greenish variegated sandy shales, white sandstone again, and over all a set of gritty orange limestone and chalky beds. In the south range are coarse or fine chalky sandstones with red fossil-bearing layers, flinty and shaly olive beds and hard shelly bands. On the crest and south sides of the hill are more brown and purple tints.\n\nOf objects of interest in Pachham are about 1\u00bd miles north-east of Kaura the remains of a fort built by R\u00e1o L\u00e1kha and demolished by Fateh Muhammad about 1800.\u00b9\n\nThough a peninsula and not an island, some account may here be given of the lowlying tract, known as the Banni, that stretches to the south-west of Pachham, between it and the mainland. Probably a bank or bar of soil brought down by the north-flowing Cutch rivers, it stretches almost parallel to the coast line of Cutch, about sixty-five miles long and from ten to sixteen broad. Where it joins the mainland, the Banni is so low that it can hardly be distinguished from the Ran. Further out it rises gently, but, except one narrow strip in the west, is all apt to be covered with water in times of high flood. The whole is scantily covered with coarse grass and b\u00e1b\u00fal trees, and supports large herds of buffaloes and other cattle, for whose use some wells and ponds have been dug. The herdsmen live in clusters of bee-hive-shaped grass huts, and under the orders of their holy men use no sleeping cots and light no lamps after dark.\n\nThe two chief routes across the Ran are in the west from Nalia in Cutch to Tuna at the west end of the Banni, and from there pretty straight north to R\u00e1vmaka Baz\u00e1r near Ali Bandar on the Kori river. The other chief route is further east from Sumr\u00e1\u015bar in Cutch, north across the middle of the Banni along the west of Pachham to B\u00e1lkari in Thar. A third route lies from the island of Bela north to Nagar. A slight depth of water does not make the Ran impassable; on the contrary, camels move safer through water than over slippery mud. Without a good guide the passage is at\n\n\u00b9 Sir A. Burnes. MS. 1828. A low parapet wall was then standing. In 1827 Pachham had 12 villages, 3 of the R\u00e1o\u2019s, 7 of the Samm\u00e1s and 2 belonging to other Musalm\u00e1n tribes. These villages contained 717 houses and a population of 2584 souls. For fear of plunderers the hamlets were on the hills, the huts all mat-roofed. During the rainy season flies and mosquitoes were so troublesome that all who could afford to go, fled to Cutch. Sir A. Burnes, MS. 1827.\nall times dangerous, travellers being sometimes lost even in the dry season. In the hot season, from the overpowering heat, and in the cold weather to avoid the blinding salt glare, the passage is generally made at night. The travellers, guided either by beacons or by the stars, generally spend from the evening to the morning in crossing.\\(^1\\)\n\nSalt, the only product of the Ran, brought partly by sea water and partly from the brackish rivers that flow into it, crusts the surface generally from one to three inches deep. Except when artificially prepared as at P\u00e1tri, it is bitter in taste and little used.\n\nThe Ran is almost certainly the raised bed of an arm of the sea, the result, only less complete, of the forces that raised the coast plains of western India and Sind. These plains are believed to have been raised pretty evenly throughout, and then to have received the deposits of the rivers that passed through them to the sea. In Cutch the raising of the land seems to have been less uniform. Along its outer edge the land was raised into ranges of hills, and inside of the hills was left a large hollow almost an inland sea. The materials washed down by the rivers gradually filled the passage between this sea and the ocean. Since then silt has gone on gathering, and will continue to gather till the rivers that bring it down find their way to the sea through an alluvial plain. Though for more than 2000 years known as iri\u00f1a or \u2018a salt marsh\u2019 \u2018the waste,\u2019 within that time many changes have occurred, and great part of the Ran seems more than once to have sunk and been flooded by the sea. Alexander the Great (325 B.C.) found the Ran a great lake;\\(^2\\) at the time of the Periplus (80 A.D.) though shoal and very hard of access the Ran seems to have been fit for navigation;\\(^3\\) and it seems probable that for nearly a thousand years after, great part of the waters of the Indus crossed the Ran on their way to the sea. The north edge of the Ran is fringed with a row of sand hills, such as in many places line the sea coast, and along that coast further to the west Vegaugad, whose brick ruins may still be seen, and further east Vingad, Bal\u00ed\u00e1ri, and Vir\u00e1van were seaports. In the east the islands off the north coast of Cutch are said to have been surrounded by a sea called Kilu. At that time Chh\u00e1ri and Nirona on the edge of the Ran between Lakhpat and the Banni; Bh\u00edt\u00e1ro on the west of the Banni; and Dor\u00e1t, Dohi, and Ph\u00e1ngv\u00e1do in the island of Pachham were harbours. In support of these local stories there are, on the north shore of Pachham about twenty feet above the present Ran level, traces of an old sea in a patch of concrete full of marine shells, and near Ph\u00e1ngv\u00e1do in Pachham pieces of iron and ship nails were thrown up by the 1819 earthquake. The date when the Ran was last navigable cannot be fixed. The stories point to the beginning of the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Mem. Geol. Sur.

But this can hardly have been the case, as it was about the middle of that century (1360) that Firoz Sh\u00e1h\u2019s army all but perished in the salt waste of the Kunchi Ran or Ran of Cutch.\u00b9\n\nThe south-east of the Ran, the part known as the Little Ran, has much later passed through considerable changes. In a creek near Vav\u00e1nia on the south coast was, about 1756, found fifteen feet deep in mud an old boat without any iron and bound with coir string, much larger than any now used in the gulf of Cutch. The village of Khor, further east on the same shore, was said to have been a seaport town in 1765, and pierced stone anchors were found on the shore of the Ran. During the present century several changes in level have taken place. In 1815, the water was imperceptibly draining off.\u00b2 In 1866 the head of the little Ran was said to be sinking, and an inquiry was made. Of two officers who gave opinions, one, Captain Hebbert, saw no reason to believe the Ran was being depressed; the other, Major Watson, thought that it was.\u00b3 Since then by the Hamtal and Mukti creeks the sea has continued to encroach. The fact is patent, Colonel Barton wrote in 1875, that year by year the sea reaches further eastward, and places, a few years ago inland villages, are now open to water traffic. The cause is by some observers traced to the formation of a groyne at the entrance of the gulf of Cambay, which by making the sea shallower is supposed to force the tidal wave higher up the land. Others hold that the land is sinking, but this does not seem as yet to have been proved.\u2074\n\nDuring the present century Cutch has suffered much from earthquakes. The most disastrous, severer than any that had happened for more than 400 years, began on the 16th June 1819. The first shock was felt at about a quarter to seven in the evening, and lasted for about two minutes. \u201cThe ground could be seen to move, it was hard to keep standing, and every house was shaken to its centre.\u201d Within four hours (11 p.m.) three slight shocks were felt, and on the next day the earth was often in motion with gusts of wind, and a noise as of the rumbling of carriages. This noise went on during the whole night, and after stopping for a few minutes at a quarter to ten, a severe shock, lasting about fifty seconds, brought down a number of shattered buildings. For six weeks there were daily shocks, and, during the next four months, they were felt at intervals, the last on the 20th November. Little has been recorded as to the speed and course of the earthquake wave. The shock seems to have been felt at the same time over the whole of Cutch, and to have travelled north about fifty-three miles a minute. Cutch seems to have been the centre of disturbance. The damage caused by the earthquake was very great. At Bhuj, 7000 houses including the Rao\u2019s palace were destroyed, and 1150 persons buried in the ruins;\n\n\u00b9 T\u00e1rikh-i-Firoz Sh\u00e1hi in Elliot, III. 324.

Barton, 1877.\nhundreds of houses in Anj\u00e1r, M\u00e1ndvi, and Lakhpat were hurled to the ground; all the fortified towns were injured, and Tera, the best fortress in Cutch, was utterly ruined. During the first and severest shocks, it was said that Dhinodhar hill sent out flames, and other hills sent out clouds of dust. But these stories were little better than hearsay, and the examination of the country by the officers of the Geological Survey has shown that neither from Dhinodhar nor from any other hill could fire or smoke have issued. Other accounts state, and these may well enough be true, that water was forced from below ground, filling the rivers up to their banks. Of lasting changes, the fall in the level of the Ran in the west at the Sindhdi basin; along the north border of the Ran; and in the east near the Pachham island, have already been noticed. But the most remarkable change was across the bed of the Kori river, along about fifty miles of country the raising, as at least it seemed from the south, of an earthen bank from ten to twenty feet high, which, as made without the hand of man, is known as All\u00e1h Band or God\u2019s mound. According to most of the early observers, this mound is not perceptibly raised above the level of the country. Though so well marked on the south, there was so little slope to the north, that in the flood of 1826 the Kori river kept to its old channel cutting through the bank.\n\nThe next earthquake recorded is a series of shocks in 1844. The shocks lasted for a month and were so threatening, that while they lasted, the people of Lakhpat feared to sleep in their houses. These shocks are said to have made the All\u00e1h Band broader, and on the south shore of the Sindhdi hollow to have raised the bed of the river, so that instead of water passing over it at every tide it was dry except at high tide, and had then a depth of only eighteen inches. In the next year (19th June 1845) a third shock is recorded which at Lakhpat threw down the walls of the fort, and caused the loss of several lives. At the same time the sea rolled up the Kori, overflowing the country twenty miles to the west, and forty miles to the north, and filling the Sindhdi lake with from one to four feet of water. From the 19th to the 25th of June, sixty-six shocks were counted and much damage done. It was thought that the land had sunk, but the flooding may have been due to a great earthquake wave. Again in 1864 there was an earthquake. But the shock was slight, chiefly felt in V\u00e1gad.\n\nLying along the north parallel of the Tropic of Cancer, Cutch is almost beyond the rain-bringing influence of the south-west monsoon. Its rain generally comes against the usual winds in squalls from the north-north-west round by north and east to south. The supply is never large and sometimes fails altogether. The average annual\n\n---\n\n1 Mem. Geol. Sur. IX. 41.\n2 The date of these shocks is not accurately fixed. It was perhaps after them that (1844) Col. Baker noticed the slope on the north of the Allah Band which had never before been reported.\n3 Mr. Wynne (Geol. Sur. IX. 38) seems to think that this and the 1844 shock are the same.\n4 Mem. Geol. Sur. IX. 39\n5 Mem. Geol. Sur. IX. 6.\nrainfall at Bhuj for the thirty years ending 1878 is returned at fourteen inches. During this period the greatest amount registered in any one year was forty inches in 1878, and the least ten cents in 1848.\\(^1\\)\n\nWind.\n\nFrom June to October the south-west monsoon winds are strongly felt, the weather being seldom calm. In the cold months, harsh east and north winds prevail, followed by strong south-westerly gales and steady winds, the air being frequently loaded with dust.\\(^2\\) Along the sea coast throughout the year, the climate is agreeable, and over the whole province for nearly nine months it is cool and healthy. But in April and May burning winds and dust storms make life miserable, and during October and part of November, the climate is oppressive and sickly. The driest seasons have been found the most healthy for Europeans.

Geol. Sur., IX, 6.\nCHAPTER II.\n\nPRODUCTION.\n\nThe chief minerals of Cutch are coal, iron, alum, salt, and building stone.\u00b9\n\nThe coal of the jurassic rocks, though never found in any large quantity or of good quality, has, for some time, attracted attention. The largest workings, those at Tr\u00e1mb\u00e1l, are now closed by the falling in of the tunnel that led into the mine. According to Mr. Blanford, in the Tr\u00e1mb\u00e1l seam of an apparent depth of one foot four inches, eight inches were good coal. Several other seams have been found, chiefly in the neighbourhood of Sis\u00e1gad in central Cutch; but all yet reached are too thin to repay the cost of working. Carbonaceous shale with coaly layers occurs in the river north of Sis\u00e1gad; and a coaly shale of which a two feet thick seam was visible, was found in a stream course west of Guneri, near Lakhpat. The coal occurred in thin bright layers between the laminae of the shale, bearing a strong resemblance to some found north of the old workings at Tr\u00e1mb\u00e1l, and perhaps lying on nearly the same horizon. None of these coals seem to be valuable. Even if the beds were thick, the intermixture of shale would be against them, while that found near Sis\u00e1gad was so brittle that it fell through the gratings of the furnaces. All that was seen in the district, broke, on exposure, into minute fragments, and no piece of even an inch square could be taken from the beds. The most clearly seen sections showed rapid thinning out of the coaly portions, so that the existence of large workable deposits seems doubtful, if not impossible. A few thin carbonaceous layers of shale have also been found in the tertiary beds, but none of them are at all promising.\n\nIron was formerly smelted; but at present the cheapness of foreign iron keeps the Cutch mines unworked. It is found in the haematitic laterite of the sub-nummulitic group, and in some ferruginous deposits near Bhach\u00e1u. The manufacture was chiefly carried on near Bhach\u00e1u, Lunva, and Dudhai in the east of the central plain, at Madh in the west of the province, near Vitroi in V\u00e1gad, and at Kaura in Pachham island.\u00b2\n\nDuring certain months of the year much alum is made at Madh. The works, reported to have been carried on for the last two or\n\n\u00b9 The account of minerals is compiled from Mem. Geol. Sur. IX. 86-94, supplemented by Mr. A. N. Pearson's report of 24th December 1878 'On the Manufacture of Cutch Alum.'\n\u00b2 The Kaura iron yielded 3\u00bd cwts. (10 mans) from 16 cwts. (45 mans) of ore. It had for some years before 1827 ceased to be worked. Sir A. Burnes. MS. 1827.\nthree centuries, have left the surface roughened by hills and heaps and seamed by cracks and hollows. The material used is a pyritous dark-gray or black shale, closely associated with a soft aluminous pseudo-breccia of the sub-nannulitic group. This appears to overlie or enclose the shale, or to have invaded it, as in some parts of the works, fragments of the shale form a coarse angular breccia with the aluminous rock as a matrix. The native burrowings give a poor chance of studying the relations of the rocks; the air in them is so bad that it is difficult to obtain light, and much of the ground may have been disturbed by 'old men's' workings, which, according to Colonel Grant, fall in every year. Each work is entered by a narrow passage, the sides cut vertically and the floor sloping. About twenty feet below the surface the open-air passage stops, and an underground gallery about six feet high and from three to four wide slopes down to the alum bed, through which, owing to the accumulation of water, no passage has ever been driven. From this results a total want of fresh air, and the heat, though only 86\u00b0, is unbearable.\n\nThe alum earth is dug out and exposed for months in heaps, a slow combustion or weathering going on from the decomposition of the pyrites. It is then spread in squares like salt pans and sprinkled with water. After about twelve days it consolidates into efflorescing and mamillated crystalline plates or crusts of sulphate of alumina, called alum seed, *phatakdi ka bij* or *turi*. These plates are in large iron pans luted inside with lime, boiled in water mixed with salt potash in the proportion of fifteen of the sulphate of alumina to six of the salt potash. Before the salt potash has time to dissolve, the fluid is ladled into small earthen vessels, somewhat the shape of flower pots, and crystallization takes place in less than two days. These crystals are again boiled one or more times to concentrate the solution, which is finally ladled into large thin bladder-shaped earthen jars, *matk\u00e1s*, with small mouths, sunk in the ground to prevent their breaking. After four days the jars are dug out and broken, and the alum in each jar having formed into one solid crystal is removed to a storehouse, the entrance to which is built up until a favourable market can be obtained. In 1867 the yearly outturn was estimated at about 294 tons (8250 *mans*). After 1867 partly from the increased competition of Chinese and English alum, partly because the Cutch alum was said to tinge cloth, and partly because the working of the mines was a mismanaged monopoly, the demand for Cutch alum almost entirely ceased. In 1878 an examination by the Bombay chemical analyser showed that Cutch alum was better than either the English or the Chinese varieties, containing only thirteen per cent of impurities and yielding to analysis 10\u00b773 per cent of alumina, or only 0\u00b712 per cent less than the theoretic quantity.\u00b9 In the hope that with better management the demand for Cutch alum may be restored, the state has discontinued the monopoly of the mines and begun to sell the alum on its own\n\n\u00b9 Mr. Pearson calculates that for every 560 pounds (14 *mans*) of alum, there are required of material 4000 pounds of alum earth, 360 pounds of salt-potash, and 240 pounds of fuel; and of labour five men for 4\u00bd days at about 1s. (2 *koris*) each a day.\naccount. It is also hoped that before long a better system of working the mines may be introduced.\\footnote{Detailed proposals have been drawn up by Mr. Pearson, and by October 1879 the Council hope to obtain the services of a person competent to superintend the sinking of the shaft, the formation of the galleries, and the erection of sheds at Madh. Cutch Administration Report for 1878-79, 6.}\n\nThe alkaline salt, largely composed of potash, which is used in the manufacture of alum, is made in various places all over Cutch. Village refuse is gathered and burned, placed over rude filters formed of bushes, and treated with water. The fluid that runs through is collected and boiled down, and the impure salt that remains is, under the name of \\textit{surokh\u00e1r}, sent to the alum works at Madh.\n\nSome friable brown shale in the sub-nummulitic and next succeeding beds, contains small resinous and black bituminous lumps, which are burned in the native temples as incense. At Madh where it is found it is called spirit-food, \\textit{bhut-kh\u00e1na}. It also occurs at Juler\u00e1i and near Lakhpat.\n\nIn Cutch salt is abundant. Nearly all the rocks are strongly impregnated with chloride of sodium and other salts, to such an extent that a stream of fresh water is, except in the stratified trap area, rarely found. Many of the river pools were observed to be lined with an incrustation of salt. On the Ran, salt is collected in places, but does not form an article of export, although it might be obtained in enormous quantities.\n\nLime is made from the sub-recent concrete or calcareous tufa, widely but irregularly distributed over the country.\n\nLarge quantities of gypsum occur in shales belonging to the jurassic, sub-nummulitic, and tertiary groups; the most highly gypsiferous being those of the sub-nummulitic band. The mineral is generally translucent; and clean blocks up to several inches by two or three, may be found weathered out on the surface of the ground. Although much of it might be obtained, without greater trouble than picking up the pieces, it does not appear to be utilised except to a slight extent by goldsmiths, who are said to use it in a powdered state for polishing their wares. Among other places it occurs near a small outlying patch of tertiary rocks on the Ran east of \u00c1desar, near Chitrod, between \u00c1dhoi and B\u00e4dargad, in V\u00e1gad, in the western part of the district about two miles south-west of Madh, also east and north-east of Umarsar, and nearer Lakhpat.\n\nSome of the decomposed red highly ferruginous beds of the sub-nummulitic series near Lakhpat are quarried, and the mass exported to form a colouring material or dye. The pale whitish shales of the jurassic rocks are very generally used to make a kind of white-wash for the humbler dwellings of the natives. And the unctuous green and white aluminous rocks of the sub-nummulitic band are used as soap, having, it is being believed, particularly cooling properties. Some similar rock, occurring as a pocket, enveloping a mass of sandstone in an intrusion of ordinary doleritic trap near the village of Ratadia, is quarried for sale in Bhuj. Some of the soft white aluminous beds of the sub-nummulitic band are roughly mined, on the west...\nside of the B\u00e1bu\u00e1 hill in the Garda country, the material being exported at K\u00f3teshvar.\n\nThe silicious ferruginous grits with quartz grains which occur both in the jurassic and sub-nummulitic groups, and a very similar rock of nearly black colour in the tertiary beds, at K\u00e1rimori hill, furnish strong tough millstones. These are also obtained from the ferruginous quartzite-like grit of a long ramp near Chandia, west of Anj\u00e1r.\n\nBuilding stones abound in Cutch. Trap is the only rock that is not extensively used. Some of the best varieties are furnished by the lower jurassics; and other much prized stones are quarried from the upper tertiary beds. In Pachham, and at other points of the Ran Island chain, some thin-bedded red or yellow calcareous rock, largely composed of broken shells, is found. This, which is also found in other parts of the province, takes a good polish, and has received the name of Dok\u00e1v\u00e1na marble. The following is a list of the building stones used at Bhuj:\n\n| Name          | Where found                                      | Character                                      |\n|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| 1.

His chief defects are his ill temper, the length of his cannon bone, and his ugly heavy brow. To improve the breed stallions are kept by the state for the use of their own mares, and of\n\n---\n\n1 Chiefly from notes supplied by Lieut. J. H. Sadler, B.Sc., Asst. Pol. Agent.\n2 Abul Fazl (1582) says 'The horses of Cutch are equal to Arabs.' It is said that a long time ago an Arab ship was wrecked and driven to the shore of Cutch, and that it had seven choice horses, from which, according to the general belief, the Cutch breed sprang. Blochmann's Ain-i-Akbari, I. 133. It seems to be to Cutch horses that Finch (1610) refers in his account of the Raja 'about Gujar\u00e1t,' who had a breed of horses 'not to be matched in the east.' They were valued at \u00a31500 (Rs. 15,000), and were said to be far above the Arabs not only for swift running, but for staying power, 'so that a man might ride one of them almost at full speed a whole day and never draw bit.' Harris, I. 91.\nany other animals that may wish to be served. More horses are bred in Abd\u00e1sa than in any other part of Cutch. Formerly (1818) they were reared by Rajputs, Molesal\u00e1ms, Gir\u00e1s\u00edas, Sindh\u00eds, and some \u00c1hir cultivators who, when young, fed them largely on goat\u2019s milk, one colt requiring from twelve to fourteen goats.\\(^1\\) Of late the fall in the value of horses, and the high price of grain and fodder have been much against horse breeding. Many who formerly reared horses for sale have given it up, and most are now bred by the state or the larger proprietors for their own use. The trade in horses is small. A very few are imported from Sindh, and a yearly average of about forty are sent from M\u00e1ndvi to Bombay and Zanzib\u00e1r. Except in the town of Bhuj where a few of the chiefs drive them, horses are used solely for riding. They are generally put to work too young, and though strong and enduring most of them at five years old are damaged. His ordinary food is a mixture of pulse, *math*, Phaseolus aconitifolius, and millet, *b\u00e1jri*, Penicillaria spicata, with in addition, in the cold season and after hard work, a mess of flour, molasses, and clarified butter. Before any extremely hard expedition the old outlaw custom of giving the horse a feed of boiled goat\u2019s or sheep\u2019s flesh is said sometimes to be still kept up.\\(^2\\) With the increased ease of importing horses from Arabia, Persia, and Australia the value of the Cutch breed has declined. In the seventeenth century (1617) Cutch horses are said to have been worth from \u00a3200 to \u00a3300 (Rs. 2000 - 3000); early in the present century (1818) their price is said to have varied from \u00a320 to \u00a3100 (Rs. 200 - 1000);\\(^3\\) and it is now returned at from \u00a310 to \u00a350 (Rs. 100 - 500).\n\nCutch has long been famous for its camels.\\(^4\\) Somewhat slightly made but very fast, they are better fitted for riding than for burden. Camels are chiefly reared by Rajputs, Rab\u00e1ris, Sindh\u00eds, and Bharv\u00e1ds. They are used for riding, carrying burdens, and turning oil-mills. Their milk is the chief article of the Rab\u00e1ris\u2019 food. The price of a camel varies from \u00a33 to \u00a312 10s. (Rs. 30 - 125).\n\nCows, oxen, and buffaloes are found in large numbers. Of oxen, there are three breeds; V\u00e1gadia, reared in V\u00e1gad by Rab\u00e1ris, Bharv\u00e1ds, and other cultivators; Bann\u00ed\u00e1i, reared in the Banni pastures generally by Musalm\u00e1ns; and Cutchi, reared in different villages of Cutch by Rab\u00e1ris and Bharv\u00e1ds. The V\u00e1gadia bullock is tall, strong, and well-made, costing from \u00a310 to \u00a325 (Rs. 100 - 250); the Banni\u00e1i bullock is, except that it is smaller, much like the V\u00e1gadia and costs from \u00a35 to \u00a315 (Rs. 50 - 150); the Cutchi, used as a pack bullock, is small and of little strength or beauty, and costs from \u00a32 10s. to \u00a312 10s. (Rs. 25 - 125). In the chief towns many bullocks devoted to the gods, *all\u00e1\u00eda*, and never set to\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) MacMurdo, Trans. Bom. Lit. Soc.

MacMurdo, Trans. Bom. Lit. Soc. II. 226.\n\n\\(^4\\) The best camels are said (1590) to have been bred in the subha of Gujar\u00e1t near Cutch. Blochmann, I. 143. It is worthy of notice that camels are reared with success not only in the dry parts of the province, but in the marshy lands of the south-west coast. Sir Alexander Burnes states that the success of camel breeders in Bagtari near Jakh\u00e1u was due to the strength they drew from feeding on salt food, MS. Report, 31st July 1828.\nany work, are seen roaming through the streets. Most Cutchi bullocks are castrated. The bulls, *ankhl\u00e1s*, are very mischievous and are considered of less value, costing from 16s. to \u00a35 (Rs. 8 - 50). A cow varies in value from 10s. to \u00a34 10s. (Rs. 5 - 45), and a she-buffalo from \u00a32 to \u00a38 (Rs. 20 - 80).\n\nThe goat is held in high esteem among the pastoral tribes of Cutch, in particular by the Muhammadans descended from the old Sindh tribes, who eat goat's flesh and live almost entirely on its milk and clarified butter. Of goats, there are two kinds, *hamia* and *deshi*, the former being shorter and of a finer breed than the latter. They are reared chiefly by the Rab\u00e1ris and Bharv\u00e1ds. Ropes and packs for bullocks are made of their wool. Sheep, kept chiefly for their milk, from which clarified butter, *ghi*, is made, are plentiful. Their wool is sold to V\u00e1nia and Loh\u00e1na merchants, and their flesh is used to a considerable extent. A goat costs from 2s. to 8s. (Rs. 1 - 4); and a sheep from 4s. to 10s. (Rs. 2 - 5).\n\nAsses of two sorts, Sindhi and Cutchi, are reared by Kumbh\u00e1rs, potters, and Ods, diggers. They are used by grain merchants and Kumbh\u00e1rs to carry burdens, and are small and untractable. They cost from 10s. to \u00a34 (Rs. 5 - 40).\n\nAt the beginning of the century, lions, tigers, and other large game were plentiful in Cutch. But of late years, tigers and lions have almost entirely disappeared. The Panther, Felis pardus, is still found and is kept for His Highness the R\u00e1o's shooting. They have good and plentiful cover among the rocky hills, and, except after killing a cow or goat, are difficult to trace. The Wolf, *varu*, Canis pallipes, the Hy\u00e6na, *taras*, Hy\u00e6na striata, and the Jackal, *sn\u00fal*, Canis aureus, are also found but not in large numbers. Of the Fox, *lokdi*, Vulpes bengalensis, three varieties are found: the first, the common grey Indian fox; the second, white with black belly and legs; and the third, a large English-like fox, of a light brown colour, with a white point to his brush. The Wild Boar, *duktar*, Sus indicus, abounds in most parts of the country and is much hunted with the gun and spear by the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s. Black Buck, *k\u00e1li\u00e1r*, Antelope bezoartica, are to be seen occasionally on the alluvial sands along the shores of the gulf of Cutch, while the common Red Antelope, *chink\u00e1ra*, Gazella benettii, are found in the same places in much larger numbers. A few Blue Bulls, *nilg\u00e1i*, Portax pictus, are also found. Besides these, Cutch has a wild animal peculiar to it, the Wild Ass, *kh\u00e1r gaddha*, Equus onager, found in the desolate wastes of the Ran. It is one of the most timid of animals, rarely coming within sight of man, seeking the loneliest spots, and coming near the Ran islands and the mainland only at night for water and grass. In the cold season it is found in the fields and does much harm to the crops. It is thirteen hands high, has a light brown neck and body, a black strip down the back, and a white belly. Like the tame ass it has long ears, but its limbs are stronger and better made. Generally moving in herds of\n\n---\n\n1 Mem. Geol. Sur. IX. 21.\n2 MacMurdo, Trans. Bom. Lit. Soc. II. 227, 228.\nfrom ten to fifty, it is sometimes found single or in pairs. Its chief food is the salt grass and shrubs of the desert. When in herds, it is not easily frightened and can be closely approached. When attacked, it is said sometimes to show fight, and in the famine of 1813, when wild asses were hunted by Kolis and other wild tribes for food, the wounded animals often attacked the hunters. The flesh is said to be tolerable food, but at ordinary times, even the lowest class of natives do not eat it. According to the local belief, there are, in every herd of wild asses, besides young ones, several grown animals both male and female. All the males, except the head of the herd, are said to be castrated. This, according to one account, is done when they are young, according to another account, as each young male comes of age, he fights the head of the herd, and the loser is mutilated and becomes the victor's follower.\n\nOf smaller animals, the Hare, *saslo*, Lepus ruficaudatus, is found in large numbers.\n\nOf the birds of Cutch Colonel C.

The rivers are too dry and brackish in the hot weather to have any large store of fish, and none of the tribes of Cutch live as deep-sea fishermen. The fishing, chiefly in the hands of V\u00e1gbers, is most practised along the shores of the gulf of Cutch. Seventy-four kinds are said to be caught. They are taken either by stake nets or by baited hooks, and sometimes by making walled or fenced enclosures along the sea shore and catching fish left stranded by the ebb tide. Sometimes milk-bush branches, Euphorbia tirucalli, are used to poison fish. Except Br\u00e1hmans, Bh\u00e1ti\u00e1s, V\u00e1ni\u00e1s, and a few other high-caste Hindus, all classes of the population eat fish. Fish salting is carried on to some extent along the coast of the gulf of Cutch. The head quarters of the industry are at Mundra, Jakh\u00e1u, Anj\u00e1r, and Bhuj. The deep-sea fishing along the Cutch coast is in the hands of south Gujar\u00e1t and north Konkan fishers chiefly from Bals\u00e1r, Daman, and T\u00e1r\u00e1pur.\nCHAPTER III.\n\nPOPULATION.\u00b9\n\nThe people of Cutch differ in several respects from the people of other parts of Gujar\u00e1t. They are more recent settlers, more vigorous, more Muhammadan, and readier to visit foreign lands. They came into Cutch chiefly from the north and north-east from Sind and M\u00e1rw\u00e1r. In early times Cutch would seem to have been held by the K\u00e1th\u00eds, \u00c1hirs, Rab\u00e1ris, and other herdsmen, till in the eighth century the province was overrun by the Ch\u00e1vd\u00e1s, and the K\u00e1th\u00eds forced south to K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. Next, in the tenth century, from the east came the Solanki conquerors, and from the north Samm\u00e1s, Sodh\u00e1s, and other Sind tribes driven south partly by Musalm\u00e1n conquests, partly by the destruction that followed the drying of the eastern branch of the Indus. In the twelfth century came the V\u00e1ghel\u00e1s from the east, and from the north Samm\u00e1s and J\u00e1dej\u00e1s up to their final conquest early in the fourteenth century. Of others, besides the ruling tribes, caste traditions point to a Sind, M\u00e1rw\u00e1r, or Gujar\u00e1t origin. Almost all Br\u00e1hmans and V\u00e1ni\u00e1s have come from M\u00e1rw\u00e1r and Gujar\u00e1t\u00b2; Bh\u00e1ti\u00e1s and Loh\u00e1n\u00e1s are from Sind and Mult\u00e1n; and of craftsmen some trace their origin to Sind and others to Gujar\u00e1t and K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r.\u00b3\n\nStrong, well-made, and muscular, the people of Cutch are rather above the middle size and among the higher ranks incline to corpulence. Gujar\u00e1ti, the home tongue of most Br\u00e1hmans and V\u00e1ni\u00e1s, and of the \u00c1hirs, Ch\u00e1ranas and other early shepherd tribes, is the language of literature, business, and general correspondence. Cutchi, closely resembling the dialect in use in the lower Indus, is the home tongue of the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s, Loh\u00e1n\u00e1s, and Bh\u00e1ti\u00e1s, and of other Sind tribes in north Cutch. Though generally understood Cutchi is seldom written.\u2074 Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed is spoken by great numbers, and, except in the north, is understood by all. Simple in their habits their food is, among the poor, for the morning meal, millet or Indian millet cakes with pulse\u2075 and whey, and, in the\n\n\u00b9 Besides what has been taken from books, this chapter has been compiled chiefly from materials supplied by Lieutenant J. W. Wray, late Assistant Political Agent, Mr. Vin\u00e1yakr\u00e1v N\u00e1r\u00e1yan N\u00e1ib Diw\u00e1n, and by Mr. Dalpatr\u00e1m P. Khakhar, Educational Inspector.\n\n\u00b2 Of Br\u00e1hmans, the S\u00e1rasvat, Pokarna, Bhojak, Nandv\u00e1na, P\u00e1liv\u00e1l, and Shrim\u00e1l sub-divisions say that they came from Rajput\u00e1na and the north; the Modh, N\u00e1g\u00e1r, Pareja, Aboti, and Kandola sub-divisions trace their origin to Gujar\u00e1t and K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r; and the Rajgars to Nagar Samai or Tatta in Sind. Except the Sorath\u00eda, V\u00e1yda, and Modh sub-divisions, who have come from K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r and Gujar\u00e1t, almost all V\u00e1ni\u00e1s are settlers from M\u00e1rw\u00e1r.\n\n\u00b3 Gold and silver smiths and Hindu and Musalm\u00e1n tape-makers and gardeners say that they were called by the state from Sind; shoemakers, carpenters, barbers, and bracelet-makers say that they came from Gujar\u00e1t; tanners and blacksmiths from K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r; washermen and polishers from Sind; coppersmiths and cotton-spinners from M\u00e1rw\u00e1r; and gilders and shield-makers from Delhi.\n\n\u2074 A translation of the Lord's Prayer into Cutchi shewed that of 32 words 24 were radically the same as the Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed and Beng\u00e1li specimens. Hamilton's Description of Hindust\u00e1n, I. 588.\n\n\u2075 The pulse generally used is korad, Phaseolus aconitifolius.\nevening mixed millet and pulse, *khichdo*. The rich use mixed rice and pulse, *khichdi*, and add clarified butter and vegetables. Their holiday food is sweetmeats among all classes, and animal food among all but Brahmans, Vani\u00e1s, and Bhati\u00e1s. Many drink liquor, and almost all take opium and opium-water, *kasumba*.\n\nMost men in Cutch, both Hindus and Musalmans, wear loose trousers, a long-sleeved under-jacket, a short coat reaching a little below the waist, a plain or silk-bordered cloth wound round the waist and falling eight or nine inches below the knees, and over it a waistband, *bheeth*. Among Hindus the most noticeable turbans are, the Rajput\u2019s large and loosely rolled, the Bhatia\u2019s close fitting and peaked, and the Nagar priest\u2019s a little bigger than a Bohora\u2019s. Excepting Bohoras, Musalmans wear the large Rajput turbans, red, black or white. The ordinary pointed Gujar\u00e1t shoe is worn by all classes. Instead of loose trousers, most Brahmans, Bhati\u00e1s, Son\u00eds, V\u00e1yda and Maheshri Vani\u00e1s, and other Vaishnavs, wear the waistcloth, and the Gujar\u00e1t long coat and shoulder cloth. Some young men have of late taken to wear tight English trousers. Except Bhatia, Loh\u00e1na, Sarasvat, and Kshatri women, whose robe, *chorso*, is five cubits long and about four broad, Brahman, Vania, and most Hindu women wear the Gujar\u00e1t robe, *s\u00e1llo*, nine cubits long and four broad, a petticoat five cubits round, and a bodice, *kamkho*, looser and longer sleeved than the Gujar\u00e1t *k\u00e1nchli*, but like it open-backed. The Girasia Rajput and Khavas women\u2019s robe is a square coloured *chorso*, five cubits long by five broad; their petticoat is twelve cubits round, and their bodice, *kamkho*, long-sleeved. Except some Meman, Khoja, and Bhadala women who wear the Musalm\u00e1n shirt, bodice, frock and trousers, the Musalm\u00e1n women\u2019s dress differs little from that of the Girasia Rajput\u00e1nis. Almost all classes of well-to-do Musalmans, and among the Hindus the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s and higher class Rajputs do not allow their women to appear in public. Proud, lazy, and luxurious, though now settling to peaceful habits, many tribes in Cutch are naturally martial and fond of predatory warfare.\n\nOf the husbandmen the number of regular cultivators is small. A large proportion belong to tribes of herdsmen who have not long settled to the work of tillage. The skill of Cutch craftsmen and sailors has long been famous, and its traders and labourers are distinguished for their vigour and for their readiness to leave their homes in search of work.\n\nAt the beginning of the present century, so progressive was Isl\u00e1m, that it seemed as if another hundred years would see the last of the Hindu faith. In the worship of many local saints the\n\n---\n\n1 Among Rajputs, when a quarrel is settled, the parties drink opium-water in token that all cause of offence is forgotten.\n2 Their freedom from conquest which they can fairly boast was in great measure due to their village fortifications and to the hardiness and number of their soldiers. In the beginning of the century almost every village was fortified; the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s could bring 8000 men into the field, Fateh Muhammad 5000, the Mi\u00e1n\u00e1s 1000, and the district of Pachham 5000. Ham. Des. of Hind. I. 587.\n3 Cutch pilots have always interested Europeans by the skill and daring of their voyages to Arabia and Africa. They (1837) understand the compass, and steer by charts and nautical tables as well kept as those of an Indiaman (Mrs. Postans\u2019 Cutch, 12). The best example of their courage and skill was R\u00e1o Godji\u2019s (1761-1779) ship, which, built, equipped and manned in Cutch, made the voyage to England and back to the Malabar Coast. (Tod\u2019s Western India, 452).\n4 Ham. Des. of Hind. I, 588.\ntenets and practices of the two religions are still often oddly mixed. But J\u00e1dej\u00e1s and other Rajputs who in 1819 freely married Musalm\u00e1n women, kept Musalm\u00e1n cooks, and in beliefs and customs were not less Musalm\u00e1n than Hindu have of late become more careful to keep from practices contrary to the Hindu religion.\n\nAbout the middle of the eighteenth century the population of Cutch is said to have been considerably greater than it was for many years after. The misgovernment towards the close of the eighteenth century, the wars carried on by Fateh Muhammad at the opening of the present century, and the deadly famine and pestilence of 1812 are said to have lowered its strength to about one-half. In 1821 Mr. Elphinstone gave the native estimate of the population at about 510,000 souls, of whom more than one-third were Musalm\u00e1ns. Two years later (1823) Colonel Tod gave 500,000, one-tenth of them found in the cities of Bhuj and M\u00e1ndvi. In 1830 the total was returned at 350,000 souls. Five years later it was given at 484,852, of whom 152,950 or nearly one-half were Musalm\u00e1ns. This would seem to have been an over-estimate as the 1852 returns give a total of only 409,522 souls, 300,420 of them Hindus and 109,102 Musalm\u00e1ns. Since then, the 1872 census has shown a total of 487,305 souls.

Except N\u00e1gars, of whom many as landholders and state servants are in good condition, most Cutch Br\u00e1hmans are poor living on alms or by tillage. S\u00e1rasvats, 5431, the largest class of Cutch Br\u00e1hmans, are said to take their name from the Sarasvati river from which they came to Cutch by way of Sind. Fair in complexion, their language and dress are those of other high class Cutch Hindus. Besides acting as family priests they follow many callings, reading holy books, drawing horoscopes, teaching private schools, trading, and serving as accountants, soldiers, and constables. Once the holders of high offices they have long lost their special position and now are degraded, eating with, and serving as the family priests of, Kshatris, Loh\u00e1ns, and Bhan\u00e1sils, whom, they say, they saved from Parshur\u00e1m's persecutions. In religion Shaivites and goddess worshippers, their family deity is Sarasvati, whose chief place of worship is on the river of the same name. Not careful to keep the ordinary Br\u00e1hman rules, they allow widow marriage, and freely travel across the seas to collect payments from their patrons, Cutch V\u00e1nia traders settled in Mozambique and Arabia. Sorathia S\u00e1rasvats, distinct from the regular S\u00e1rasvats and associating with no class of Cutch Br\u00e1hmans, are a small body with a great local name for learning. R\u00e1jgors\n\n---\n\n1 Another account derives their name from Brahma's daughter Sarasvati, and traces their descent to her son, the sage Dadhichi.\n\n2 The chief of their goddesses are Ambika, A\u015b\u00e1hpura, Bhav\u00e1ni, Kum\u00e1ri, and Mah\u00e1laxmi.\nor chief's family priests,\\(^1\\) 4738, originally of the Audich stock, though degraded in the eyes of other Br\u00e1hmans, are in Cutch a favoured class owning lands and villages, acting as J\u00e1dejas' priests and as husbandmen. The R\u00e1jgors allow widow marriage, and eat with V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s and Leva Kanbis. Audichs, 2945, within the last 250 years settled in Cutch from Sihor near Bh\u00e1vnagar, Jh\u00e1lav\u00e1d, and Jun\u00e1gad in K\u00e1thi\u00e1war, form three divisions, Gohelv\u00e1di, Jh\u00e1lav\u00e1di, and Gadhvi, and live chiefly in Bhuj, M\u00e1ndvi, and Abd\u00e1s\u00e1. Fair in complexion all are Shaivites in faith, except the Pur\u00e1n readers who, probably in compliment to their V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1 and Bhatia patrons, have become followers of Vallabh\u00e1ch\u00e1rya. V\u00e1gad Audichs are cultivators, and as they carry cooked food to their fields, smoke the huka, and allow widow marriage, are held degraded. Still in matters of marriage they are allowed to give their daughters to Audich Br\u00e1hmans of Halvad in K\u00e1thi\u00e1war, whose daughters again marry with Dhr\u00e1ngadra Andichs, and the daughters of Dhr\u00e1ngadra Audichs with Audich Br\u00e1hmans of Viramgam, Ahmedabad, and Sidhpur, the highest Gujar\u00e1t representatives of their caste. The other Audichs are, by profession, horsebreakers dh\u00e1raks, priests, cooks, beggars, astrologers, schoolmasters, traders, writers, and Pur\u00e1n reciters.\n\nPokarna's,\\(^2\\) 2321, chiefly from M\u00e1rv\u00e1r and Sind, generally swarthy in complexion, do not differ in language and dress from other high class Cutch Hindus. They are enterprising,\\(^3\\) travelling to various parts of India, and many of them anxious to visit Zanzib\u00e9r and Arabia though prevented by their caste rules. They act as family priests to Bhati\u00e1s, and like their patrons are willing to follow any calling. They are chiefly engaged as husbandmen, contractors, confectioners, and clerks. Followers of Vallabh\u00e1ch\u00e1rya, their family goddesses are Lakshmiji and Ch\u00e1munda in M\u00e1rv\u00e1r. They wear the sacred thread putting it on with little ceremony, generally at a relation's marriage or at some place of pilgrimage. High caste Br\u00e1hmans do not eat with them. Among members of the same family stock, gotra, marriage is not allowed. On the sixth day after child-birth the women of the family, singing as at a marriage, bring a clay horse from the house of the mother's father to her husband's house. At marriages the men dance in the procession and the women sing\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) One account of the origin of the name R\u00e1jgor is that two of their ancestors, Karanji and Naranji from Shihor and Is\u00e1mi, while on their way as pilgrims to the temple of Hinglaj M\u00e1ta, 100 miles (60 kos) from Kurraschee, married the daughter of one Hard\u00e1s, the family priest of the Sammas then living at Nagar Samai on the site of the modern Tatta. This Hard\u00e1s allowed the self-sacrifice of the daughters of J\u00e1m L\u00e1kha, and sanctioned infanticide among the J\u00e1dejas. Conscience-smitten at the evil he had sanctioned, Hard\u00e1s sacrificed himself on the funeral pyre asking J\u00e1m L\u00e1kha to accept his sons-in-law as his family priests. J\u00e1m L\u00e1kha agreed and all J\u00e1dejas still employ R\u00e1jgor priests.\n\n\\(^2\\) According to one account they take their name from Pshkhar-kehtra in Rajput\u00e1na where one of them went from Shrim\u00e1l and being received with honour, settled. According to another account they were called Pshakp\u00e1rn, because they offered flowers to Lakshmi, and being cursed by P\u00e1rvat\u00ed for refusing to eat flesh, migrated from Jesalmir to Sind, Cutch, Mult\u00e1n, and the Panj\u00e1b. Other castes affirm that the Pokarna is the illegitimate offspring of a Br\u00e1hman devotee and a Mohani fisherwoman, who imprudently undertook to ferry the holy man across a stream.

Education is spreading among them and their condition is improving. **Parajia's**, 2138, degraded Audichs, take their name from Paraj near Junagadh, where they came from Isaml\u00ed and Marwar, and they say in 691 (747 S.) agreed to act as family priests to Charans and Ahirs. From Junagadh they moved to Cutch, and settling in Pranthal and Gedi, spread to Palansa and Adesar. When, in the reign of Rao Bharmalji I. (1585 - 1631), the Ahirs left Vaghela territory and settled in Chobari and Anjar, their priests came with them. They own the Makhel village near Palansa and there, as well as in some other places, are cultivators. They speak Gujarati and dress like Ahirs. Unlike other Brahmins, Paraji\u00e1s place a dish with a wheat flour ball on the chest of the dead body, throw the ball to the crows, and, after breaking a piece of its edge, give the dish to a low caste man; they also give the six monthly feast after death, chhamasi, at the end of the first month and the anniversary feast, varsi, at the end of six months. Shaivites or worshippers of goddesses, they wear the sacred thread, but as they allow widow marriage and eat with Rajputs, Suthars, Luhars, Bharvads, Kumbhars, Ahirs, Rabaris, and Darjis, they are held degraded.\n\n**Na'gars**, 1394, of two divisions, Vadnagr\u00e1s, state servants, priests and beggars, and Visnagr\u00e1s, land-holders, are said to have come to Cutch in the time of Rao Khengarji (1550). **Modhs**, 914, taking their name from the village of Moherak or Modhera in the Dharmaranya near the modern Chuv\u00e1l, are of three sub-divisions, Chaturvedi, Trivedi, and Jethimal. The first, followers of the four Veds, are in Cutch of four family stocks, gotras. Generally fair, remarkably clean and religious, they are priests, copyists, writers, Pur\u00e1n reciters, cooks, and beggars. They are a well-to-do class and fond of giving caste dinners. Followers of Ram they belong to the sect of Ramanandis. The Trivedis, followers of three Veds, claim descent from R\u00e1mcandra, the hero of the Ramayan. According to their story they separated from the other Modh sub-divisions at Modhera, and persecuted by Al\u00e1-ud-din Khilji (1304) fled to Cutch. Fair in complexion, they speak Gujarati and dress in the ordinary Cutch fashion. Most are priests to Modh Vani\u00e1s and in poor circumstances. Shaivites in religion their family goddess is Bhat\u00e1rika of Modhera. At their marriages the bridegroom's maternal uncle dressing as a jhanda, in women's clothes from head to waist, and in men's clothes below, rubs his\n\n---\n\n1 At a sacrifice performed by Brahma, Vishnu, and Rudra, at the mythical Brahmaranya, 18,000 Brahmins officiated as priests. Seeing them without wives the three powers, shaktis, at the request of the gods, each created 6000 virgins. Their families including twenty-four stocks, were from living at Modhera, called Modhs, and formed themselves into six sub-divisions, Chaturvedi, Trivedi, Jethimal, Dhinoja, T\u00e1ndalja, and Agi\u00e1rasa. Dharmaranya section of the Skanda Pur\u00e1n.\n\n2 The other three sub-divisions, Agi\u00e1rasa, Dhinoja, and T\u00e1ndalja, are not found in Cutch.\n\n3 At a sacrifice performed at Modhera in Chuv\u00e1l by R\u00e1mcandra, these Brahmins 18,000 in number officiated as priests. For their maintenance Ram created 36,000 Vani\u00e1s also styled Modh. Every two of these he ordered to maintain a Brahman as their priest, and this order the Vani\u00e1s follow to this day.\n\n4 Jhanda, more commonly called Janda, who in quaint costume is often represented by strolling players, bhav\u00e1g\u00e1s, was a Path\u00e1n fakir. To propitiate his spirit, the Modh Vani\u00e1s introduced this custom at marriages, but finding it irksome transferred it to their priests the Trivedi Modhs, by whom it is still kept up.\nface with oil, and daubs it with red powder, and then armed with a sword, goes with the bride and bridegroom to a place where two roads cross, and stays there till the pair offer their goddess food. V\u0101d\u012bsambh\u0101na Modhs are a Chaturvedi sub-division put out of caste about 100 years ago for supporting a man who married his widowed daughter to a Vair\u0101gi. Jethimals, wrestlers, 163, the third Modh subdivision, fair, strong, muscular, and many of them tall, speak Gujar\u0101ti. The men have lately begun to wear Cutch clothes though the women still keep to the ordinary Gujar\u0101t dress. State messengers and professional wrestlers, they allow widow marriage, and, except those who follow Sv\u0101min\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47, have no objection to animal food and liquor. They are generally goddess worshippers, their family goddess being Limboja in Dimm\u0101r. Of late their condition has improved owing to the spread of education and their increased employment as clerks.\n\nS\u0101chor\u0101's,\u00b9 878, of two divisions, chiefly found in V\u0101gad, of fair complexion, speak Gujar\u0101ti and wear the ordinary Cutch dress. Though some are cooks in Vaishnav temples, beggars, and traders, most are husbandmen in V\u0101ghela villages. Generally well off, they are Shaivites or Vishnavites in religion following the S\u0101m and Yajur Veds.\u00b2 The chief place of their family goddess Pratyangira is at Satipur or S\u0101chor in Jodhpur. They do not dine with other Br\u0101hmans. Shrim\u0101lis, 870, claim descent from fourteen sages, rishis, to whom on the occasion of her marriage with Krishna, the Shrim\u0101l district was made over by Lakshmi. They were then of fourteen family stocks, gotras, numbering in all 45,000 souls. Eight hundred years later, 18,000 families left Shrim\u0101l and settled at Pushkarkshetra in Rajput\u0101na whence they came to be called Pushkarn\u0101s or Pokarn\u0101s. Out of these 18,000, 5000 dined with Osv\u0101l V\u0101ni\u0101s of Osnagar in P\u0101rkar and came to be called diners, bhojaks, forming a separate caste. Unusually fair in complexion, their language and dress are Gujar\u0101ti. Living as priests of V\u0101ni\u0101 Sonis, and Shrim\u0101li V\u0101ni\u0101s, husbandmen, traders, cooks, and beggars they are as a class well-to-do. Shaivites in faith, their family goddess is Mah\u0101laksmi of Bhinm\u0101l. At marriages the bride's father must for ten days at least feed the bridegroom's relations, and generally feeds them for ten or twenty days more. They do not dine with other high caste Br\u0101hmans. Girn\u0101ra's, 787, of the Panai sub-division of mount Girn\u0101r Br\u0101hmans,\u00b3 have a tradition that Krishna when he rose from the D\u0101modar reservoir at Raivat\u0101chal, the modern Girn\u0101r, established them as Br\u0101hmans. More than three hundred years ago about 1557, their number in Cutch was 1100. Very fair in complexion, they are of average size, speak Gujar\u0101ti and, except that their turbans are Cutchi, wear the Gujar\u0101t dress. They are a well-to-do class living as priests, Pur\u0101n reciters, astrologers, writers,\n\n\u00b9 The name of this caste, said to have been formed in the first cycle, Sat Yug, is said to be a corruption of Satiha or Satipur. Sati D\u0101kh\u015b\u0101yani bestowed the town of Satipur on thirty-six descendants of Brahma. On their deserting it some time after, a great king, Pururava, collected eighteen families, the ancestors of the present S\u0101chor\u0101s, and re-peopled the town of Satipur.\n\u00b2 The Rigvedi S\u0101chor\u0101s of M\u0101rv\u0101r are not found in Cutch.\n\u00b3 The other sub-divisions of Girn\u0101ra's, Bardais, Ajikias, and Chorv\u0101ri\u0101s are not found in Cutch.\nwater-carriers, money-lenders, cooks especially in Vaishnav temples and houses, state and private clerks, and grant, gir\u00e1s, holders. They do not eat with high caste Br\u00e1hmans. Vaishnavs of the Vallabh\u00e1ch\u00e1rya sect, they follow the Rig, S\u00e1m, and Yajur Veds, and have thirty-six family goddesses, whose temples are in Sorath and H\u00e1l\u00e1r in K\u00e1thi\u00e1war. Veda'nts, 440, called Vediya's in Benares, descendants of the sage Vedamv\u00fd\u00e1s, are rather dark in complexion and speak and dress in the ordinary Cutch fashion. Though some are priests and schoolmasters, most are husbandmen. Followers of the Yajur Ved, and Shaivites and Vaishnavs in faith, they are a well-to-do class. The chief place of worship of their family goddess Sarasvati is at Benares. They wear the sacred thread and dine with V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s.\n\nAbotis, 391, trace their origin to the sage V\u00e1lmiki's younger son, who, with other sages, was brought by garud, Vishnu's eagle, to a sacrifice performed by Krishna at Dw\u00e1rka. Rather fair in complexion their language and dress are Gujar\u00e1t\u00ed. As a class they are poor, living as temple servants, traders, beggars, and confectioners. Vaishnavs in religion, their family god is Dw\u00e1rk\u00e1n\u00e1th at Dw\u00e1rka. Nandva'na's, 350, found about Anj\u00e1r, claim descent from the sage N\u00e1ndi who, when officiating at a horse sacrifice, was cursed by Brahma's wife S\u00e1vitri. Blighted by this curse his descendants lost all scripture knowledge, but by the kindness of their family goddess V\u00e1nkal at Vir\u00e1ni in M\u00e1rw\u00e1r, they re-gained their knowledge and are now admitted to be priests. Except that their women dress in Cutch fashion their language and dress are Gujar\u00e1t\u00ed. Traders and cultivators they are chiefly Shaivites following the Yajur Ved. P\u00e1liva'ls, 255, belonging to the Gaud division of Br\u00e1hmans, take their name from P\u00e1li in M\u00e1rw\u00e1r which, they say, was about 1200 wrested from them by Sioji R\u00e1thod, nephew of Jaychand of Kanooj, whose kingdom was overthrown by Sh\u00e1hbuddin Gori (A.D. 1193). Their language and dress still show traces of a M\u00e1rv\u00e1di origin. Priests, husbandmen, and beggars, they are goddess worshippers, their family deity being Bauchr\u00e1ji of Chuv\u00e1l near Virag\u00e1m. Bhojak's, 182, came from Shrim\u00e1l to Osnagar in P\u00e1rkar, separating from their Shrim\u00e1l parent stock. Called Bhojak's, diners, from eating with other castos, they came to Cutch with the Osv\u00e1ls. Generally fair, they speak Gujar\u00e1t\u00ed and wear the ordinary Cutch dress. They are beggars, priests of Jain V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, and ministrants in Jain temples, where they act as songsters and musicians, on new year's day making verses in honour of their V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1 patrons. In spite of the wishes of their patrons they cling to the worship of goddesses and refuse to become Jains. They wear the sacred thread and are fairly well off, spending large sums of money in bringing wives from M\u00e1rw\u00e1r. Shevaks, 174, are degraded ministrants in Vaishnav temples. Ayra Br\u00e1hmans, 160, associating with \u00c1hirs for whom they act as family priests and with whom they eat, are the same as Paraj\u00edas. Other minor classes are Gauds, 112, are beggars. Guglis, 86, said to take their name from the\n\n---\n\n1 The Paliv\u00e1ls in the village of Nakhtr\u00e1n\u00e1 are rich money-lenders, some of them native doctors.\naloe, gugal,1 are rather fair, and speak and dress in Gujar\u00e1t fashion. Priests of R\u00e1jgors, and ministrants or beggars in Vaishnav temples, they officiate as priests in shr\u00e1ddh ceremonies performed at the Gomti lake in Dw\u00e1rka, and levy fixed taxes on pilgrims visiting that holy island. Followers of the Yajur Ved and Vaishnavites, each family has its own goddess, Visot or Chandrabh\u00e1ga at Dw\u00e1rka. As a class they are poor. Sompura's,17, brought into Cutch from Somn\u00e1th P\u00e1tan, are Gujar\u00e1tis in language and dress. Priests of Sompura Sal\u00e1ts, they are Shaivs in faith following the S\u00e1m and Yajur Veds. Their family goddess is V\u00e1gheshv\u00e1ri. As a class they are well-to-do. Mota'la's, 16, and Deccanis, 7, are state servants and in good circumstances. Kandolia's,2 26, from K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, priests to the Sorathia V\u00e1ni\u00e1s, are Gujar\u00e1tis in language and dress. Shaivs or Vaishnavs in religion their family goddess is S\u00e1mu\u00e1ri, of Kandolia near Dhor\u00e1ji in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. Jha'ora's, 58, are beggars, V\u00e1ydas, 4, are priests to V\u00e1yda V\u00e1ni\u00e1s, and Purabia's, 68, of North India, are soldiers.\n\nWriters included two classes, K\u00e1yasths 380, and Brahma-Kshatris 3890, a total of 4270 souls or 1\u00b715 per cent of the Hindu population. K\u00e1yasths are said, about the end of the sixteenth century, to have come to Cutch from Sind, M\u00e1rv\u00e1r, Ahmedabad, and Sorath. Once largely employed in the R\u00e1o's army they were much more numerous than at present. They are found in Bhuj, M\u00e1ndvi, Anj\u00e1r, and Mundra as state servants or accountants and as merchants and clerks. They belong to three sub-divisions, Mathur, Shrivastak, and V\u00e1lmiik. Most of them are Mathurs, but as all intermarry there is little difference. In colour much like the better class of V\u00e1ni\u00e1s, they wear the sacred thread and have lately taken to the V\u00e1ni\u00e1 and Rajput instead of the Bh\u00e1tia turban. They respect Br\u00e1hmans and belong to the Shaiv, Vaishnav, and Sv\u00e1m\u00edn\u00e1r\u00e1y\u00e1n sects. There is no leading family among them. Though none of them are scholars they freely send their children to school even to Bombay.\n\nKshatris, properly Brahma-Kshatris3, 3890, found in M\u00e1ndvi and Bhuj, and in small numbers over the whole province, are said to have originally lived in the Antarved, that is, the land between the Ganges and the Jamna. They call themselves Suryavanshi Kshatris\n\n---\n\n1 The story is that of 60,000 Br\u00e1hmans called V\u00e1lkhel, created by Brahma, 505 sent to Bet and Dw\u00e1rka were by a demon called Kush prevented from living there. But by offering a sacrifice of sami wood, and gugal, the fragrant gum of the Amyris agallocha, they procured his destruction.\n\n2 At the request of the sage Kanva whose austerities pleased him, Brahma created 18,000 Br\u00e1hmans in Kalp at the foot of the Him\u00e1layas, and 36,000 in Saur\u00e1shtra. The sage ordered Sorathia V\u00e1ni\u00e1s to accept them as their priests and entrusted king M\u00e1ndh\u00e1ta of Ayodhya with their protection. The hermitage of Kanva called Kanva Sth\u00e1n in the S\u00e1t Yug, P\u00e1p\u00e1panodan in Treta, and K\u00e1mpil Sth\u00e1n in Dv\u00e1para, is known as Kandol Sth\u00e1n in the present Kali Yuga, and is represented by the village of Kandolia near Morvi.\n\n3 In Gujar\u00e1t proper and K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r the artisan Brahma-Kshatris are known by different names according to their occupation, such as Chudgars, bracelet makers; Sanghd\u00e1dis and Khav\u00e1dis, turners; Rang\u00e1rd\u00eds, dyers; Petigh\u00e1dis, box makers; and B\u00e1ndh\u00e1nd\u00e1dis and in Bombay and the Deccan, Kant\u00e1ris.\nand claim descent from the twelve sons of king Ratnasen who, during Parshur\u00e1m's persecutions, were saved by the sage Dadhichi and brought up in his hermitage as Br\u00e1hman boys. On a visit of Parshur\u00e1m to his hermitage, Dadhichi passing them off as Br\u00e1hman boys, Parshur\u00e1m took away the eldest and taught him the art of war. Finding how he had been deceived, Parshur\u00e1m cursed the boy, and made useless his knowledge of war. At Dadhichi's advice the boy went with his brothers and propitiated the goddess Hingl\u00e1j. Unable altogether to reverse the curse, the goddess allowed them to reign for three generations in Sindh Sauvir when they were driven out by the Barbar, a tribe of foreigners. Again visiting the goddess she told them to give up hope of becoming rulers, and ordered Vishvakarma to teach them the arts of dyeing, weaving, turning, and carpentry. As craftsmen they increased, and spreading over M\u00e1rv\u00e1r, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Gujar\u00e1t, and Cutch, are now divided into 96 families. They wear the Br\u00e1hman thread. Following different professions all belong to the same caste, have the same S\u00e1rasvat Br\u00e1hmans for priests, and have the same nulhs or family names. Fair in appearance like Gujar\u00e1t Kshatris, Cutch Brahma-Kshatris, in language, food, and dress, do not differ from other middle class Cutch Hindus. Most are dyers, calico-printers, silk-weavers, and carpenters, but some are revenue contractors, writers, land-holders, money-lenders, traders, and ship-owners. Those at M\u00e1ndvi are writers, silk-weavers, and labourers, and those at Bhuj, dyers. Though some have risen to high posts, as a class they are badly off. At their marriages, accompanied by a party of his friends, the bridegroom, dressed in white, with a drawn sword and cocoanut in his hand, rides to the bride's house, and is there received by the bride's mother. Throwing a cloth round his neck she leads him to a cot in the centre of the marriage booth where the bride lies covered with one or two quilts. The bridegroom walks four times round the cot, distributes sweetmeats and a cocoanut, and, without seeing his bride, retires to a neighbouring house, returning some time after for the regular ceremony. During the ceremony both bride and bridegroom wear a white dress sprinkled with yellow, and when the marriage is over the bride's father-in-law gives her a suit of clothes with a special design, bh\u00e1t, not found in the clothes of other castes. Widow marriage is allowed by artisan Brahma-Kshatris. The practice is said to date from R\u00e1ja Todar Mal, who at Akbar's request married his widowed daughter a girl eleven years old. In widow marriages the bride and bridegroom instead of looking at each other look at their reflections in earthen waterpots. Their family goddess is Hingl\u00e1j, and excepting a few Vaishnavas who belong to the Vallabh\u00e1ch\u00e1ri sect, they are generally followers of Shiv and M\u00e1ta. In every village they have a place called the manayi with an image of Hingl\u00e1j or \u00c1sh\u00e1\u00e1pura. A few Kshatris send their children to school, but they are not a pushing or a prosperous class. The section of the Brahma-Kshatris, writers and Government servants who, immigrants from L\u00e1hor, hold themselves aloof from the craftsmen; do not allow widow marriage, and, as family priests have S\u00e1rasvat Br\u00e1hmans, who, unlike other S\u00e1rasvats, do not dine with Loh\u00e1n\u00e1s and\nBhans\u00e1lis, though well known in most parts of Gujar\u00e1t, are not found in Cutch.\n\nOf Merchants, Traders, and Shopkeepers, there were fifteen classes with a strength of 117,684 souls or 31.93 per cent of the whole Hindu population. They belong to two main sections, Cutchis originally from Sind whose home tongue is Cutchi, and Gujar\u00e1tis who speak Gujar\u00e1ti and have most of them come from Gujar\u00e1t within the last 200 years. Of the fifteen classes, eleven were Meshri or Br\u00e1hmanic and three Shr\u00e1vak or Jain V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s.\n\nFollowing this division there are of Meshri Va'ni\u00e1s, Modhs, 1191, who, taking their name from Modhera in Par\u00e1ntij, are found in the chief towns of the province. They are said to have fled to Cutch from the persecution of Al\u00e1-ud-din Khilji (1295-1315). Of the six divisions, Dasa and Visa Goghv\u00e1s, Dasa and Visa Ad\u00e1lj\u00e1s, and Dasa and Visa M\u00e1ndali\u00e1s, distinct in other parts of Gujar\u00e1t, four, Dasa and Visa Goghv\u00e1s and Dasa and Visa Ad\u00e1lj\u00e1s, intermarry in Cutch and K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. M\u00e1ndali\u00e1s, who are also found in Cutch, are separate. Fair in complexion their look and home tongue are those of Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s. Living in well-built houses, they are neat, hardworking, intelligent, and, especially in Bhuj, well-to-do. Some of them of late have risen to high places in the state, but most are merchants, accountants, state and private clerks, shopkeepers, and turners. Especially the M\u00e1ndali\u00e1s, Modh V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s are religious, followers of Vallabh\u00e1ch\u00e1rya, and careful to visit the shrine of their family goddess Bhadr\u00e1rika at Modhera. Though they claim the right to do so all do not wear the sacred thread. Widow marriage is forbidden and polygamy is practised and allowed only when the first wife proves barren. At marriages, except among the M\u00e1ndali\u00e1s, Modh bridegrooms wear the sword. They have a headman, patel, but allow him little authority. All Modhs give their children some Gujar\u00e1ti schooling, and are, on the whole, prosperous and well-to-do.\n\nV\u00e1ydas. V\u00e1yda's (358), coming in the latter part of the sixteenth century from V\u00e1yad in P\u00e1tan, are found only in the towns of Bhuj, Koth\u00e1ra, M\u00e1ndvi, Nalia, and Tera. Their two sub-divisions Dasa and Visa, the Visa very small and found only in Bhuj, marry with each other and with Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1ydas. Speaking Gujar\u00e1ti, and wearing the Bh\u00e1tia turban and a simpler and coarser dress than other V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, they are clean, hardworking, quiet, and honest, some of them labourers, but most dealing in tobacco and grocery. They are in middling condition generally well removed from poverty. Though they wear the Vaishnav sect-mark, kanthi, they are not strict Vaishnavs. Their priests are V\u00e1yda Br\u00e1hmans of whom there is only one family in Cutch. Sprung, according to their caste tradition, from V\u00e1yu's son Hanum\u00e1n the monkey god, though they hide it from outsiders, the bridegroom goes to the bride's house dressed as a monkey and there leaps about in monkey fashion. Allowing polygamy, but forbidding widow marriage, the caste has a headman, patel, who settles disputes with the help of some of the leading members. Most V\u00e1ydas give their boys some little Gujar\u00e1ti schooling. Sorathia's (161), found in M\u00e1ndvi, have come from Sorath in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r,\nand claim to be of the solar race. Intermarrying with the K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r Sorathi\u00e1s, their language and dress are Gujar\u00e1ti. Traders and merchants' clerks, most of them are in a middling condition. Vaishnavs in faith their family goddess is S\u00e1mundri. They allow polygamy, but forbid widow marriage. Jh\u00e1'lor\u00e1's, (97), a small community found at M\u00e1ndvi and Vir\u00e1ni, said to have been created by P\u00e1rvati to maintain V\u00e1lkhel Br\u00e1hmans, take their name from Jh\u00e1lor in M\u00e1rv\u00e1r, whence they seem to have migrated to Cutch. Their three sub-divisions, Dasa, Visa, and P\u00e1ncha, speak Gujar\u00e1ti and dress in Cutch fashion like Gujar Osv\u00e1ls. Generally traders, shopkeepers, and writers; they are a poor class. Shaivs, Vaishnavs, and goddess worshippers, their family goddess is Hinja (P\u00e1rvati) at R\u00e1ythanpur. They allow polygamy, but forbid widow marriage. Kara'ds (213), found chiefly at Godhra in the south, claim descent from Kashyap, one of the seven seers, Sapt Rishis, and state that, originally of the Meshri sub-division, they came from M\u00e1rv\u00e1r to Cutch before the main body of their caste. Prospering in their new land and taking a new name, they began to despise the Meshris who retaliated by stopping intermarriage. Then the Kar\u00e1ds associated with Cutch Osv\u00e1ls and mostly adopted Jainism, though some, especially in foreign parts, kept to the Br\u00e1hmanic faith. Cultivators and traders they are very well off. They allow polygamy if the first wife is barren, but forbid widow marriage. Meshris (868), more correctly Maheshris, found at Madh, Bhuj, M\u00e1ndvi, and in the west, are said to have come to Cutch about 500 years ago from N\u00e1g\u00f3r in Thar, and, establishing themselves in K\u00e1nthi, to have gradually spread over Abd\u00e1sa. Speaking Thar Gujar\u00e1ti they wear a turban much like that worn by Thar V\u00e1ni\u00e1s, something between the ordinary V\u00e1n\u00ed and the Bh\u00e1tia head-dress. Chiefly dealers in clarified butter, ghi, oil, sugar, and molasses, they are a religious people, in middling condition. Vaishnavs in name, but with goddesses as their family guardians, their hereditary family priests are P\u00e1liv\u00e1l Br\u00e1hmans, though of late some Pokarn\u00e1s have by purchase secured their patronage. Practising neither polygamy nor widow marriage, they are peculiar in not allowing their women to join the marriage party that goes to fetch the bride. A headman, seth, with the help of other respectable members settles caste disputes. Most of them give their boys some Gujar\u00e1ti schooling, and to better their condition have, in considerable numbers, moved from Cutch to Bombay. Nha'goris, a branch of Meshris, intermarry with, and in religion do not differ from, the main body of the caste. Their women dress like Modhs and their men wear Cutch Br\u00e1hman turbans.\n\nV\u00e1'nia Son\u00eds,\u00b9 an offshoot of the Visa Shrim\u00e1li V\u00e1ni\u00e1s, wear the Gujar\u00e1ti dress, and are by profession goldsmiths, making ornaments and setting precious stones. Dining with V\u00e1ni\u00e1s and not putting on the sacred thread, they are followers of Vallabh\u00e1-ch\u00e1rya and goddesses. Their family goddess is V\u00e1gheshv\u00e1ri.\n\n\u00b9 They call themselves the descendants of the elder of two sons born at the temple of V\u00e1gheshv\u00e1ri about 1000 years ago, who adopted the profession of a goldsmith, the younger becoming a trader. See below p. 71.\nChapter III.\n\nPopulation.\n\nTraders.\n\nSHRA'VAK VA'NIA'S.\n\nShrim\u00e1lis.\n\nOf Shea'vak Va'nia's there are three classes: Shrim\u00e1'lis (5745), of two sub-divisions Visa 4400 and Dasa 1345, a comparatively small caste, are found all over the province. According to their caste story, at Shrim\u00e1l 90,000 families were created by Lakshmiji out of her flower garland to maintain 45,000 Shrim\u00e1li Br\u00e1hmans. Those sprung from the right side of the garland were called Visa, and those from the left, Dasa. Of rather dark complexion, both wear the ordinary Cutchi dress and speak Gujar\u00e1t\u00ed, the Vis\u00e1s with a rather indistinct pronunciation. Clean, industrious, sober, and thrifty, both are traders, merchants, and clerks generally well-to-do. Though so far alike, the two divisions do not intermarry and differ from each other in religion and customs. The Vis\u00e1s are all Th\u00e1nakv\u00e1si or non-image-worshipping Jains; the Das\u00e1s are image-worshipping Jains, Vaishnavs, and Shaivs. The family priests of both Vis\u00e1s and Das\u00e1s are Shrim\u00e1li Br\u00e1hmans. Unlike the Das\u00e1s, the Vis\u00e1s intermarry with the Visa Osv\u00e1ls and do not keep the yearly Hindu rites, shr\u00e1ddh, in memory of deceased ancestors. The family goddesses of the Vis\u00e1s are Sach\u00e1i and Ch\u00e1munda, and of the Das\u00e1s Mah\u00e1lakshmi of Bhim\u00e1l in M\u00e1rv\u00e1r. Kandois (265), an offshoot from the Dasa Shrim\u00e1lis, are now a separate caste. Confectioners by calling, they do not differ in other respects from their parent caste. Cutch Osv\u00e1ls (47,472), from Os, Parinagar, and Budhesar in P\u00e1rkar, say, that forced to leave P\u00e1rkar on account of the misconduct of their chief, they went to Sind, and, finding the Musalm\u00e1n element too strong, came to Cutch. They are of three sub-divisions, Visa, Dasa, and P\u00e1ncha. The Das\u00e1s separated about three hundred years ago wishing to introduce widow marriage. They afterwards gave up the practice, and, within the last few years, a small offshoot reintroduced it and were named P\u00e1nch\u00e1s. Vis\u00e1s and Das\u00e1s are found over the whole country, the Vis\u00e1s chiefly in K\u00e1nthi and the Das\u00e1s in Abd\u00e1sa. The P\u00e1nch\u00e1s, about 125 families, are chiefly confined to Abd\u00e1sa. Speaking Cutchi, the Das\u00e1s, but not the Vis\u00e1s wear a turban somewhat like the Bh\u00e1tia head-dress. They are a mild people, even among V\u00e1ni\u00e1s, and have good saving habits. Some of them traders, but most cultivators, they are in good circumstances, slowly gaining the ownership, g\u00edv\u00e1s, of rent-free lands. Chiefly image-worshipping Jains in religion their family goddess is\n\n---\n\n1 Jains of the Der\u00e1v\u00e1si sect worship the images of some goddess, and of the twenty-four saints, tirthankars.\n\n2 Another story is that the Shrim\u00e1l king Desal allowed none but millionaires to live inside his city walls. One of the lucky citizens, a Shrim\u00e1li V\u00e1ni named Ru\u00e1d had a brother named S\u00e1\u00e1d, whose fortune did not come up to the chief's standard of wealth. Forced to live outside he asked his brother to help him to make up the required million, but meeting with no encouragement he and Jaychand, a discontented son of the king of Shrim\u00e1l, and many Shrim\u00e1lis, Rajputs, and others left Shrim\u00e1l, and settling in the town of M\u00e1ndovad, called it Os\u00e1 or the frontier. Among the settlers were Shrim\u00e1li V\u00e1ni\u00e1s, Bhatti, Choh\u00e1n, Ghelot, God, Gohil, Hada, J\u00e1dav, Makv\u00e1na, Parm\u00e1r, R\u00e1thod and Thar Rajputs, all devout worshippers of Shiv. Ratsansuri a Jain beggar, by working miracles, converted Jaychand their king, and all the settlers to his faith, and calling them Osv\u00e1ls formed them into one caste. This is said to have happened on the Sth Shravan vad (August) 166 A.D. Shrim\u00e1li Br\u00e1hmans of the family name of Magha, who had come with them, being converted died with them, and are therefore called Bhojaks. Tod (Western India, 465) gives a different account of their origin claiming them as descendants of the Solanki kings of Anhilv\u00e1da (942-1240) who gave up the sword for the till.\nSatya in P\u00e1kar. In both divisions every settlement has its headman, *patel*, who have considerable influence, two or three of them meeting and settling caste disputes. Most Cutch Osv\u00e1ls give their boys some slight schooling. Gujar Osv\u00e1ls (11,499), living in towns all over the province, speak Gujarati and are the richest class of Cutch V\u00e1ni\u00e1s, all of them traders and merchants. Jains in religion both of the image and non-image worshipping sects, their family priests are Bhojaks occasionally helped by some less illiterate Br\u00e1hmans. They have a headman, *patel*, who, calling in some respectable members, settles caste disputes. They are a prosperous class, educating their children and willing to take to new pursuits.\n\nBesides V\u00e1ni\u00e1s, under the head Merchants come Bh\u00e1ti\u00e1s, Loh\u00e1n\u00e1s, Bhans\u00e1lis, Dep\u00e1l\u00e1s, and V\u00e1v\u00e1s, though many Loh\u00e1n\u00e1s and Bhans\u00e1lis are husbandmen, not traders.\n\n*Bha'tia's,* about 20,000, are found in all parts of the province. They claim to be Bh\u00e1ti Rajputs of the Y\u00e1dav stock, who under the name of Bhattis or Bh\u00e1tis are the ruling tribe in Jesalmir in north Rajput\u00e1na, and, as Musalm\u00e1n Bh\u00e1tis, are found in considerable numbers in the L\u00e1hor and Mult\u00e1n divisions of the Panj\u00e1b, and to a less extent in the North-West Provinces. In Sind, best known as the traders of Shik\u00e1rpur, they are found over the whole province chiefly in Abd\u00e1s\u00e1 and P\u00e1var, and the towns of M\u00e1ndvi, Mundra, and Anj\u00e1r. According to Panj\u00e1b accounts their earliest capital (600 B.C.) was at Gajnipur, supposed by General Cunningham to have been not far from the modern R\u00e1val Pindi. From this, he thinks, they were in the first century A.D. driven south-east before the Indo-Skythians. Tod mentions that in the eighth century the Yadu Bh\u00e1tis were driven south of the Satlaj. But it would seem from the accounts of the third expedition (1004) of Mahmud of Ghazni\n\n---\n\n1 Bh\u00e1ti\u00e1 or Bhattia comes, according to General Cunningham, from *bhat* a warrior (Ancient Geog. I. 247). They are also said to be called either after Bhat one of the sons of S\u00e1liv\u00e1han (As. Res. IX. 218), or Bhupat the grandson of S\u00e1m. (Tuhfatul-Kir\u00e1m : Elliot, I. 338). The census returns, apparently by mistake, give only 7755 instead of 20,000.\n\n2 The Bhattis and J\u00e1dej\u00e1s are branches of the Y\u00e1davs. Gladwin's A'in-Akbari, II. 377. The Hindu Y\u00e1davs of Jesalmir are called Bhattis, their brethren of the Panj\u00e1b who have become Musalm\u00e1ns are known as Bhattis. Cunningham's Arch. Rep. 1863-64, II. 20. The rulers of Jesalmir are Bhattis, those of Bik\u00e1ner Bh\u00e1tis, and the Hindu traders of Shik\u00e1rpur in Sind Bh\u00e1ti\u00e1s. Elliot's Races, N. W. P., I. 37.\n\n3 North Rajput\u00e1na is the modern head-quarters of the Bhattis. The boundaries are roughly, on the north the Satlaj, on the east Harriana, on the south Bik\u00e1ner, and on the west the desert. Ham. Gaz. I. 226. In the beginning of the century their head-quarters were at Bhatner 130 miles north-east of Bik\u00e1ner, Ditto.\n\n4 Elliot's Races, N. W. P., I. 37,38.\n\n5 Elliot's Races, N. W.

He also says (222) that some tribes have settled to the east of the Ganges.\n\n7 Cunningham, Arch. Rep. II. 22. According to General Cunningham, the Y\u00e1davs were led (79 A.D.) by the great S\u00e1liv\u00e1han and by his son R\u00e1s\u00e1lu, the founder of Sy\u00e1lkot. (Arch. Rep. II. 21). According to Wilford (As. Res. IX. 218, 222) some tribes of Bhattis strongly insist on their descent from S\u00e1liv\u00e1han and call themselves Vaisyas of S\u00e1liv\u00e1han, Saka-R\u00e1ja-Vansas or Saka-R\u00e1ja-Kum\u00e1rs the offspring of Sak or S\u00e1liv\u00e1han. They are said to consider their chief the representative of S\u00e1liv\u00e1han and an incarnation of Vishnu.\n\n8 Western India, 154.\nthat there was still a strong Bh\u00e1tia kingdom at Bh\u00e1tia or Bherah on the left bank of the Jhelam near the salt range.\\footnote{Elliot's History, II. 30 and 440. The Bhatti Rajputs still point to this tract as the place of their residence before their advance eastward, and their name is still preserved in the large town of Pindi Bhattean on the Chindh. (Ditto, 441).} And it was probably by the later Musalm\u00e1n invaders that the Bh\u00e1tias were driven south into the desert and Sind.\\footnote{Sir H. Elliot traces the decline of the district of Bh\u00e4ttiana, between Hissar and the Garra, to the Muhammadan and Moghal invasions up to the crowning rava es of Timur (1399). Races, N. W. P., II. 21, 22.} In Sind the Bh\u00e1tias are said to have sunk to be fishermen, and there they still continue to eat fish and drink spirits.\\footnote{Trans. Bom. Lit. Soc. II. 244.} The date of the Bh\u00e1tias' arrival in Cutch has not been traced. Probably most of them have settled since the establishment of Jadeja power (about 1350). Their two sub-divisions, Dasa and Visa, eat together. But the Vis\u00e1s, while taking Dasa girls, rarely give Das\u00e1s their daughters in marriage. They are well made, tall, and active, according to MacMurdo (1818), a remarkably fair and handsome race.\\footnote{Trans. Bom. Lit. Soc. II. 245. So the Bh\u00e1tias of Bh\u00e4ttiana are said to be one of the finest and handsomest tribes in India. Jour. A. S. Beng. XXXV. II. 97.} Their home language is Cutchi. Except that the women's robe is somewhat scantier, and that the men's turban has an extra peak or horn in front, their dress is the same as the V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s'. Keen, vigorous, subtle, and unscrupulous, as merchants, traders, and brokers, they have, under the British Government, risen to much wealth and importance. Numbers have moved either permanently or for a time to Bombay, and as there is no difficulty in the way of their travelling, many of them are settled, to the west, in the ports of the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, and Zanzib\u00e1r, and, in the east, as far as China.\\footnote{Among Bh\u00e1tias, writes Sir Bartle Frere (1875), 'are the keenest of traders, the most sensual of voluptuaries, intellects remarkable even among Hindus for acuteness and subtlety, sometimes an obtuseness of moral consciousness which would startle a galley slave, but in rare exceptions a simple devotion to truth which would do honour to a Christian martyr'. MacMillan's Magazine, XXXII. 552.} Others are spread over Gujar\u00e1t as retail shopkeepers and milk-sellers. In Cutch, besides as traders, clerks and shopkeepers, many of them earn a living as husbandmen, and a few as labourers. Probably from the religious feeling against taking life none deal in vegetables or in root crops. Their women are clever with the needle, flowering silk with much skill and taste.\\footnote{Trans. Bom. Lit. Soc. II. 244.}\n\nAbout the close of the fifteenth century, the Cutch Bh\u00e1tias were converted to the Vallabh\u00e1ch\u00e1rya sect of Vaishnavs. Under the influence of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1s, for whom they have a very extreme veneration, they have become very strict vegetarians, most careful not to take life, and very observant of religious rites. They wear the sacred thread and do not allow widow marriage. They have a head-man, mah\u00e1jana, but give him no authority, and settle all caste disputes according to the opinion of the majority of members. On the whole they are a rising class, careful to teach their children to read and write Gujar\u00e1ti, the rich beginning to invest their savings in buying landed estates.\n\nLoh\u00e1\u0144a's (30,939) are found all over Cutch. Originally R\u00e1thod Rajputs, they are said to take their name from Loh\u00e1npur or Lohokot.\nin Mult\u00e1n\u00b9 and to have been driven by the Musalm\u00e1ns from the Panj\u00e1b into Sind, and afterwards, about the thirteenth century, to have found their way to Cutch.\u00b2 In Cutch, in the seventeenth century, especially during the reigns of L\u00e1kh\u00e1ji and R\u00e1yadhan II., Loh\u00e1n\u00e1s held very high posts as bankers and ministers. In 1746 they were most bitterly persecuted by L\u00e1kh\u00e1ji, sixty-five of the chief families tortured to death and a sum of \u00a380,000 extorted from them, and again in 1778 the head of the caste (Devchand) was put to death and a large fine levied from his relations. Since then a Loh\u00e1na has never risen to the post of minister, and few of them are now men of much wealth and position.\u00b3 Among the Sind Loh\u00e1n\u00e1s there are at least fifty sub-divisions, the chief of them Khud\u00e1b\u00e1di and Sehv\u00e1n\u00ed.\u2074 But in Cutch clan titles have worn down into family names, nukhs, and all dine together and intermarry. Darker than Bh\u00e1ti\u00e1s they are like them tall, strong, and muscular. Their home tongue is Cutchi and the dress, both of men and women, is that of other high class Cutch Hindus. They openly eat flesh and drink spirits.\u2075 Very sturdy and hardworking, they are most useful labourers, masons, and husbandmen. Some are very successful writers, shopkeepers, and grain-dealers. But, unlike the Bh\u00e1ti\u00e1s, they seldom risk large ventures or push their fortunes in Persia, Arabia, or Africa.\u2076 Vaishnavs of the R\u00e1m\u00e1nuj sect their family goddess is R\u00e1ndel M\u00e1ta, and they are devout worshippers of the Spirit of the Indus, darya pir, who is said to have saved them when they fled from Mult\u00e1n.\u2077 Every Loh\u00e1na village has a place built in honour of this spirit, where a lamp, fed with clarified butter, is kept burning day and night, and where in the month of Cha\u00edtra (March-April) a festival is celebrated. They wear the sacred thread and allow polygamy and widow marriage. They have a headman, patel, but give him no personal authority, settling disputes at caste meetings according to the\n\n\u00b9 Burton's Sind, 314. Burgess' Arch. Sur. Rep. 1874, 195.

Under Chach (700) a Loh\u00e1na named A'gham was governor of Br\u00e1hmanabad and the name Loh\u00e1na is said to have then included the Samma and L\u00e1kha clans. Elliot's History, I. 362; MacMurdo, Jour. R. A. Soc. I. 247. Loh\u00e1n\u00e1s are still the chief Hindu tribe in Sind. Besides in the Panj\u00e1b, north-west Cutch, and Sind, Loh\u00e1n\u00e1s are found in Baluch\u00edst\u00e1n, Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n, the eastern parts of Central Asia, and on the Arabian coast, amongst a barbarous and a hostile people enduring all kinds of hardship and braving no little danger in pursuit of wealth. Burton's Sind, 314.\n\n\u00b3 Since their arrival in Cutch a large number of Loh\u00e1n\u00e1s have become Musalm\u00e1ns of the Mem\u00e1n sect.

Of their arrival in Cutch nothing certain is known, but they probably settled during the eleventh century when Cutch formed part of the possessions of the Anhilv\u00e1da Solankis. Except in wearing small gold earrings and a white skull cap when working in the field, their dress and language are like those of other good caste Cutch husbandmen. When hard-worked the Bhans\u00e1li adds to his allowance of clarified butter, and in the cold weather sometimes takes sweet oil with his bread. All smoke tobacco, and a few eat meat and drink liquor; none take opium. Husbandmen, shopkeepers, and traders, they are hardworking and thrifty. Though, except some who have made fortunes in Bombay, few of them are rich, as a class they are free from debt, generally owning one or two milch buffaloes and cows. Except one monthly holiday and three or four special rest days, the Bhans\u00e1li cultivator works in the field from sunrise to sunset, his wife bringing him dinner at noon and generally working with him for some hours. Vaishnavs in name, some of them worship goddesses. But they chiefly reverence the M\u00e1ndvi saint, S\u00e1dhu L\u00e1ld\u00e1s, to whom they yearly make a present of 6d. (4 as.) and some grain. Their family goddess is Mah\u00e1m\u00e1ya of Sidhpur P\u00e1tan. Contrary to rule they shave only twice, and bathe only once a month. More than other Cutch Hindus they live as joint families. Children are betrothed soon after birth and married about ten. Birth and marriage registers are kept by their priests, and widows are allowed to marry. They are on the whole a declining caste.\n\n**Dep\u00e1l\u00e1s.** (111), perhaps from Dep\u00e1lpur in the Panj\u00e1b, are found in small numbers in different parts of Cutch. Originally Loh\u00e1n\u00e1s they have separated from the main body of the caste, and, though they dine with them, do not intermarry.\u00b2 Their language and dress are Gujarati, and they are employed as house servants, labourers, and traders. They wear the sacred thread and allow widow marriage. Their family goddesses are \u00c1sh\u00e1pura, Tripura, and K\u00e1lika. Some families also worship the god Narsingji whose chief temple is in Dhr\u00e1ngadra. Though poor as a class, one of them not many years ago rose to a high position in the service of the state. **V\u00e1'v\u00e1s,** 13, grain parchers by trade, differ little from Loh\u00e1n\u00e1s and Dep\u00e1l\u00e1s with whom they dine.\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Of the origin of Bhans\u00e1li or Bhans\u00e1ri, a lately adopted name, no explanation has been found. It is said to come from a mythical king Bhanusal. Formerly they were generally known as Veg\u00e1s or Vegus, meaning a mixed race. They seem to be the tribe referred to (1818) in Hamilton's Description of Hindust\u00e1n (I. 589) as varansankars or men of mixed birth. About 1200 they had a fort, Vegugad, in the Ran, north of Lakhpat, of which traces still remain. De Barras (1550) (Dec. IV. lib. V. cap. I.) mentions them, under the name of Banga\u00e7aris, as a kind of merchants who eat meat and fish.\n\n\u00b2 The Dhr\u00e1ngadra and Wadhwan Loh\u00e1n\u00e1s do not dine with Dep\u00e1l\u00e1s.\nRajputs, 40,166 strong or 10.87 per cent of the total Hindu population, form two main divisions; those who have come from Sind, and those who have come from Gujar\u00e1t. Sind Rajputs (23,649) include the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s, the twenty-three low class Samma clans known as Dangs, and the Sodh\u00e1s. Gujar\u00e1t Rajputs (16,517) include, besides a number of smaller clans known locally as Gujars, representatives of the great Ch\u00e1vda, Solanki, V\u00e1ghela, and Gohil tribes.\n\nJa'deja's, the ruling clan in Cutch, with a strength of about 18,599 souls, found all over the province and especially numerous in Abd\u00e1s\u00e1 and K\u00e1nti, are the leading Hindu representatives of the old Sind tribe of Samma Rajputs. The present Samm\u00e1s claim as Musalm\u00e1ns a more or less Arab origin. But they, as well as the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s, almost certainly belong to the great Y\u00e1dav stock whose pedigree goes back to S\u00e1mba, son of Krishna, and who are probably the Sambastae and Sambus of Alexander's (325 B.C.) historians. Early in the eighth century (712), the Samm\u00e1s are specially mentioned as coming, with dancing and the beating of drums, to meet the Arab conqueror Muhammad K\u00e1sim, and to have gladly accepted his rule. Under the Sumra dynasty (1025-1315), the Samm\u00e1s probably maintained a half independent position in the south of Sind, and would seem at several times between the eleventh and fourteenth centuries to have moved south to Cutch to avoid Sumra tyranny. On the overthrow of the Sumr\u00e1s by Al\u00e1-ud-din (1315), the Samm\u00e1s, with their head-quarters at Samai near Tatta, became the rulers of south Sind. In the spread of Muhammedan power, the Samm\u00e1s, before the close of the fourteenth century, had adopted Isl\u00e1m, and since their conversion, though it is still borne by several large pastoral tribes, the name Samma is less known than those of the Hindu branches of the tribe, the S\u00e1mej\u00e1s and J\u00e1dej\u00e1s. According to the latest accounts, the name J\u00e1deja was taken by the\n\n---\n\n1 They are said to be descended from an Arab Abi Jahl, also to take their name from Sh\u00e1m or Syria, or from S\u00e1m the son of the prophet Nuh or Noah. Their chief's title J\u00e1m is in the same way traced to the great Persian J\u00e1m or Jamshed. Elliot's History, I. 495.\n\n2 Sambus people are said at that time to have been under the influence of Br\u00e1hmans. Rooke's Arrian, 165. Tod connects the Samm\u00e1s with S\u00e1mba, son of Krishna, who brought a colony of Y\u00e1davs from Dw\u00e1rka in K\u00e1thi\u00e1war to Sind: (Western India, 466). According to another account, the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s, claiming to be sprung from Krishna and the Y\u00e1davs, trace their descent through a line of eighty mythical sovereigns of Shonitpur and Misar, the latter Egypt, the former (otherwise called Devikot) the capital of B\u00e1ngsur a legendary king of Southern India, whose story is told in the Vishnu Pur\u00e1n.

Elliot, I. 496.\n\n4 Though the Sumras were the nominal rulers, their power was far from being complete, and, both from the mention of independent chiefs in the south of Sind at the time of N\u00e1sir-ud-din's invasion early in the thirteenth century, and from the lists of chiefs who ruled somewhere near Tatta, the Samm\u00e1s probably continued independent. Elliot's History, I. 493.\n\n5 Umar Sumra stretched forth the hand of tyranny over the people of Samma, the ancient tenants of the soil. Many families were driven by his exactions to abandon the land of their birth and seek refuge in Cutch, which lies between Gujar\u00e1t and Sind, and this land by God's mercy they have held to the present day.

Whether J\u00e1deja was a new name, whether they about this time became Musalm\u00e1ns and afterwards returned to Hinduism, and whether these changes of religion were the cause of infanticide are doubtful points. On the whole it seems probable that they were called J\u00e1deja after J\u00e1da the father of the new line of rulers; that they had, probably as far back as the eleventh or twelfth century, been converted to the doctrines of the Karmatian sect of heretic Musalm\u00e1ns; and that, though the killing of children was no new custom,\n\n1 Burgess' Arch. Rep. 1874-75, 199.\n2 Vivien de St. Martin (G\u00e9ographie Grecque et Latine de l'Inde, 206, 207) identifies them with Pliny's (77 A.D.) Derange with whom the Buza or Bonddas, an old branch of the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s, is associated. Another reference to the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s is, about 1200, in the interpolated passage of the Tar\u00edkh-i-M'Asumi (Elliot, I. 216-223), in the reign of Sumra Duda the ruler of south Sind, where J\u00e1dej\u00e1s are several times mentioned with Baluchis and Sodh\u00e1s and are in one place spoken of as men of J\u00e1deja, J\u00e1t Baluchis by race. (Elliot, I. 217, 218). These passages, confused and of doubtful authority, are supported by the stories which, attempting to prove that it dates from L\u00e1kha, (about 1350) show that at L\u00e1kha's time the name was already in use. Of L\u00e1kha's story there are two versions. Of these the Rao's version (Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 203) makes out that L\u00e1kha was one of twins, and as in Cutch a twin is called J\u00e1da he was known as J\u00e1deja. Tod's version (Western India, 474) is that L\u00e1kha was the only one of seven sons saved from an epidemic, and that as he was cured by waving a peacock-feather brush, j\u00e1da, round him he came to be called J\u00e1da. While offering these fanciful explanations, both stories agree that L\u00e1kha was the son of J\u00e1da, and J\u00e1da's name is the most natural and likely origin of the word. The ending in j\u00e1da, meaning son of, is very common among Rajput and allied tribes. (Major J. W. Watson).\n\n3 It appears from the detailed account in Ferishta, II. 390-392, that the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s had been converted to Isl\u00e1m long before the time of Mahmud B\u00e9gada (1459-1511). (Compare Gladwin's Ain-i-Akbari, II. 72, the Muhammedan religion has (1590) long prevailed in Cutch). Beyond calling them heretics Ferishta does not mention what form of the faith the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s followed. But for several reasons it seems probable that they, with many of the people of Sind, were converted by the leaders of the Karmatian sect, probably in the eleventh or twelfth century. Three accounts are given of the origin of the name and sect of the Karmatians, Kar\u00e1mitah. According to D'Herbelot (Biblioth\u00e8que Orientale, I. 507), it comes from Hamd\u00e1n near Kuifa, the birth-place of their founder. According to Elliot (Hist. II. 573) it comes from Karm\u00e1t, secret, a name given to the founder because he adopted a secret style of writing. According to the Dabistan (David Shea's Translation, II. 421, note) the founder was nicknamed Karmatah, the crooked. This founder Ahmad or Hamd\u00e1n, the son of Ashath, appeared in 891 (278 H.) as an adherent of Ahmad, son of Abd-allah, son of Maimun Kaddah the ancestor of Said or Obaid-allah, the founder of the Fatemite Kh\u00e1l\u00edfs. Recommending community of women, and releasing men from all moral and religious duties, or, according to Elliot, teaching the doctrine that everything desirable is obtainable, Hamd\u00e1n Karmata differed from his predecessors in endeavouring to carry out his views by violence, and began an open unrelenting war upon the ruling powers. According to D'Herbelot (I. 508) they believed in a government of angels and devils, turned the orders of the Kur\u00e1n into allegories, said that the religious fast was a symbol of the secrecy which should be used to strangers, and that unfaithfulness to the religious head, not fornication, was the uncleanness forbidden by the Kur\u00e1n. In the year 899 or 903 (286 or 290 H.), under Said surnamed H\u00e1b\u00e1b, the Karmatians waged war upon the Kh\u00e1lif Motadhel in Syria, taking and fixing their head quarters at Hagi\u00e1r the Petra Deserti of the Romans, once the capital of Arabia, where, after a reign of about ten years, Said was assassinated. During his sons' government, in 923 (311 H.), the towns of Basra and Kuifa were captured, and, in 931 (319 H.), under a famous leader, Abu T\u00e1hir, the city of Mecca was taken with terrible slaughter, the temple plundered and the holy black stone, hajr-ul-aswad, carried away, and kept for twenty years. Ar-Razi the twentieth Kh\u00e1lif agreed to pay them an annual subsidy to secure the safe passage of pilgrims to Mecca. On the death of Said's last son Yusuf or Abu Y\u00e1kub, in 976 (366 H.), the Karmatians confided their government to two Syeds called pure, sadat. Towards the close of the tenth century the government of Hagi\u00e1r, weakened by disputes, came\ntheir isolation in Cutch was the cause of its becoming universal. Since their arrival in Cutch, the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s have maintained their position as the rulers of the province. A body, or brotherhood, of chiefs, each in his own estate very independent of the head of the clan, though dissipated, thriftless, and stained by the crime of infanticide, they have kept a high name for independence and courage. Driven by the crimes of their rulers to seek the help of the British, the smaller chiefs gained in 1818 a high position in the state. Since then by their idleness, and by the growing division of estates, due to peace and the consequent increase of numbers, their condition has sunk so low that about twenty-five per cent of the whole clan are little more than field labourers and peasant proprietors. It has lately been found that only eleven were, as holders of one or more villages, fitted for the exercise of police and magisterial powers. Sturdy, high-featured, and manly in bearing, in colour rather dark and ruddy, the men are chiefly noticeable for their flowing whiskers divided by a narrow parting down the chin, and their long drooping mustachios, which they carefully dress and constantly fondle, and dye when they begin to turn grey. They also wear a peculiar tuft of hair, j\u00e1di, behind the top knot. The women, by birth Rajput\u00e1nis of the Jh\u00e1la, V\u00e1ghela, Sodha, and Gohil tribes, are famous for their good looks, and the care they take to preserve them even when advanced in years.\n\nFormerly each J\u00e1deja chief had a fort of some strength. These were all thrown down by the 1819 earthquake and almost none of them rebuilt. The mansion, dv\u00e1r or darb\u00e1r, of a large proprietor or under-lord Th\u00e1kor (Plan I.) forms a quadrangle, about 150 feet long by 120 broad, enclosed by a well-built stone wall about ten to twenty feet high separated by a passage from any of the inner buildings. Entered by a passage (A) called v\u00e1nkv\u00e1yu the enclosure has, outside the gate but within the encircling wall, a shed, chop\u00e1d, (a) used as a lodging for the poorer class of guests. On either side of the entrance passage is a\n\nto an end, and the Karmatians were dispersed. (Shea's Dabist\u00e1n, II. 421, note 1). They seem at an early period to have pushed into the Indus valley. According to Al-Biruni (970-1039), they destroyed the great Mult\u00e1n idol, and the heretical king whom Mahmud Ghaznav\u00ed in 1020 (410 H.) drove from Mult\u00e1n, is known, from statements made by more than one writer, to have been a member of the Karmatian sect. Although Mahmud expelled the chief the heresy was not suppressed. Muhammad Ghori in 1175 (571 H.) (Tabak\u00e1t\u00ed N\u00e1siri in Elliot, II. 293) is mentioned as delivering Mult\u00e1n from the hands of Karmatians. In 1237 (634 H.) the Karmatians in some force attacked the great Delhi mosque and slew many worshippers, but were finally overpowered and every one of them killed. (Elliot, II. 573). Two points support the belief that the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s belonged to the Karmatian sect. About 1032 (422 H.) one of the Sumra dynasties was a Karmatian (Elliot, I. 491); and the Baluchis who, the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s say, converted them to Isl\u00e1m (Perishta, II. 390-92) were many of them Karmatians, a trace still remaining in the Baluch olan Karmati (Elliot, I. 492). Further it seems possible that in the loose faith and morals of the Karmatians the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s found support for infanticide, a practice opposed both to the Hindu and Musalm\u00e1n religions.\n\n1 The J\u00e1dej\u00e1s pride themselves on their whiskers and mustachios. The mustachios, each sometimes half a yard long, are trained in two locks falling to the chest, Mrs. Postans' Cutch, 137, 138.\n\n2 In Cutch the under-chiefs are never called Darb\u00e1r, that title being kept entirely for the R\u00e1o.\nraised platform, *deli* (b and c), generally with an upper storey. On one of these platforms the J\u00e1deja sits and receives visitors, and on the other sit the servants and the lower class of guests. Inside of these platforms is an open space or outer court (B) with, to the right, in the outer corner a fenced space (C) used as a pound. Inside of this space are two platforms (d and e) and a room (f) where the J\u00e1deja bathes, breakfasts, and sleeps in the afternoon, and where *gir\u00e1sia* guests are lodged. Inside of this, entered by a middle passage (h), is a stable (g) and a cattle shed and cart-room (i). Across the court on the left hand side are, in the outer corner, a space (D) used for storing grass and fuel, and, close by, with a front verandah (j), two rooms (k and k') the sons' quarters, *kunvar karai*. By a passage (E), placed so that no direct view is given, the inner court (F) called *dodhi* is entered. To the right is a privy (l) and a well, and to the left, inside of a verandah (m), is the temple (n) of the goddess Mom\u00e1ya and its kitchen (n'). Entering through a doorway to the right of this inner yard not far from the well, is the women's yard (G), with, in the outer corner, a granary, *koth\u00e1r*, (o). To the left facing the women's yard are the chief rooms of the house, a verandah (p) in front, usually with concrete floors, and to the left a cook room (q) and a water room (r). Through the verandah is an inner verandah (s) and within it are\n\n---\n\n**J\u00e1deja's House**\n\n![Diagram](image-url)\ntwo rooms (t and t') substantially built of stone and mortar with concrete floors, and for light two or three openings high up the walls. In one of these the women of the family keep their furniture, and in the other the J\u00e1deja sleeps. The dwelling of a smaller proprietor, gir\u00e1sia, (Plan II.) is a quadrangle of about 48 feet by 40, surrounded by a thorn fence. On the left at the entrance door is a shed (a) with rooms for cattle and for storing grain. Across the enclosure (A) are the chief rooms of the house with an open verandah (b) and cook room (c) and inside two chief rooms (d and d') the walls of mud and rubble and the roof of tile. A poor J\u00e1deja's house differs little from those of Kanbi and V\u00e1nia husbandmen.\n\nThe men's head-dress is a common silk, mashru, cap, and over it a large loosely-rolled turban red with the young and white with the old; a long coat with wide sleeves; a scarf, dark with the young and white with the old, wound round the loins, the ends falling to the knees and fastened at the waist by a variety of waist-cloths; a pair of loose trousers with a tight button at the ankle, and pointed shoes. They are good horsemen, and, as arms, wear a short sword and one or two knives, but they are poor shots and the art of fencing has almost died out.\u00b9 The women\u00b2 wear a petticoat, loose spencer and head scarf, and, except when in mourning, never go out without slippers. Of petticoats, usually about twenty feet long worn plaited round the waist and hanging to the ankle, most women have about fifteen, those for every day wear of cotton or cheap silk, and those for state occasions of cloth of gold or gold-fringed silk. A petticoat, lengha, of about seventy-five feet of fine Turkey red cloth, sewn into a large number of folds is coming into fashion as a home dress. It is not yet used as a full dress. Of bodices, kamkha, rather loose and without a back, most women have about forty. All are made of different coloured pieces of silk, the finest ones with thick lace borders. The head scarf, chorso, seven feet by eight, often changing in fashion, is, for ordinary use, of plain cotton, and, for full dress, has a gold lace border and on the end that shews, a gold lace fringe. The favourite colours are blue, red, and green. Yellow and purple are seldom worn. Berango or menia, iron-grey on a red ground, the colour of old age and mourning, is also, as a mark of sympathy, worn by young women whose friends have been widowed. Certain ornaments, depending on the relationship to the person who has died, are left off in sign of mourning. J\u00e1deja women generally wear a plain suit in the morning and a finer suit in the evening. They keep their best clothes for special ceremonies. They take the greatest care of their clothes and are famous for the length of time they manage to keep them fresh. Very fond of rich clothes they care less for jewels than other Hindus, and have a rule never to\n\n\u00b9 J\u00e1d\u00e9j\u00e1s were in old times famed for their skill as archers, Briggs' Ferishta, IV. 58.\n\u00b2 The Rajput\u00e1ni, as well as the ladies of Europe, has her cosmetics and washes and understands how to make an artificial mole or patch on the most favourable spot to set off the beauty of her skin.

Lamp black, but not antimony, surma, is used for the eyes, and henna to colour the hands and feet.\n\nIn a rich family the head of the house rises about five, and after smoking a pipe and washing, dresses, and seating himself in the gateway platform, dehi, is joined by Bh\u00e1t, Ch\u00e1ran, and some other friends. As they sit a servant brings a dish of opium water, kasumba. This the host, after offering it to a Bh\u00e1t, Ch\u00e1ran, or Rajput proprietor, gir\u00e1sia, if one is present, drinks some of it and gives the rest to the people round. The opium water is followed by a pipe, huka. Then about eight, for an hour or two, he hears complaints from the villagers, and prescribes for the sick, most J\u00e1dej\u00e1s having some knowledge of medicine and some of them keeping a store of drugs. He then goes to the stable for breakfast. Before breakfast, once every two or three days, he bathes, not regularly, the only rule being that the oftener he takes opium the seldomer he bathes. After bathing, sometimes incense is burned and a few beads told. Then, in some places in the verandah, but generally in the stable, breakfast is served. The party, for if well-to-do the head of the house is generally joined by some respectable Ch\u00e1rans and Gir\u00e1sias, seated on narrow mattresses, eat, either from one big platter placed on a wooden stool, or each from a separate plate. The meal is of millet and wheat bread, pulse and rice khichdi, butter served in a small cup, and whey, sometimes milk, in a jug. After another pipe the J\u00e1deja goes to rest, and, rising about two, washes and dresses, and sits chatting or settling family matters till, about five, he goes to the village temple and comes back at dusk. Taking his seat in the gateway platform, if he is a big man a torch is lighted and people come and pay their respects to him and he hears complaints and settles disputes. About eight, putting off his outer robe, he goes to M\u00e1ta\u2019s temple, and washing his hands and feet burns incense and says some prayers.\u00b9 He then goes to the women\u2019s quarters, where, seated on a small quilted seat, he gathers his children round him and chats with them till supper is ready. He eats supper in the women\u2019s quarters with the men and some of the children of the family, the meal consisting of pulse and rice khichdi, millet bread, pickles, thin wafer biscuits, p\u00e1pad, and milk. Some J\u00e1dej\u00e1s never come out after dinner. Others sit in the gateway and smoke, hearing news and stories, and go to rest in the women\u2019s quarters about ten or eleven. The young men of the family spend most of their time in looking after boundaries, tracking thieves and robbers, training horses, and learning to hunt and shoot. The wife of a J\u00e1deja rises later than her husband, about sunrise.

Then, after washing, she looks to the distribution of\nwhey and milk among servants and dependents, bathes about eight,\nbows to the sacred basil, looks after the children's breakfast, and going\nto the kitchen superintends the cooking or helps to make some of\nthe finer dishes. After her husband has done, she breakfasts, sleeps\nfor a couple of hours, and if young sews or chats, or if old reads or\nlistens to sacred books till evening. Before dark they put on fresh\nand richer clothes, and the young wives but not the daughters of the\nhouse, thrice as in the morning, reverence the mother-in-law and\nother older women. A lamp fed with butter is then lighted in the\nwater room and the women go and help in looking after the\npreparing of dinner.\n\nIn 1818, many were in matters of food Muhammadans, employing\nMusalm\u00e1n cooks, eating flesh, and refusing things forbidden in the\nKur\u00e1n. Now, except about five per cent, they live as Hindus, most\nof them on simple fare, respecting the Rajput feeling against eating\nthe domestic fowl, and seldom using animal food. Some among them,\nof the Vaishnav sect, are strict vegetarians. The men are greatly\ngiven to the use of tobacco and opium water, but except at their\nmarriages they do not drink liquor to excess. The women chew\ntobacco and the old women take snuff, but they never smoke or take\nopium, and seldom drink liquor or eat meat. When meat is used, it\nis duly killed by a Musalm\u00e1n and cooked at a distance from the usual\nkitchen. In youth, vigorous, manly, and independent, the Jadeja\nis soon aged by debauchery, and though kindly, honest, courteous,\nand in some matters keenwitted, is always thriftless, thoughtless,\nslow, slovenly, and proud. The women, very tidy and careful\nof their looks, are bold, enterprising, and high-spirited, according\nto the proverb, 'the wise mothers of fools.' Intriguing, jealous,\nambitious, thrifty, and fond of show, as the proverb says, 'they marry\nthe land, not the man,' and when they can secure rich husbands,\nhave their separate villages and their own establishments. They\n\n---\n\n1 The form of reverence is, covering the right hand with the end of the head cloth,\nto stretch it to the ground and then thrice raise it to the head.\n\n2 In the matter of liquor drinking the Jadejas seem to have improved. The early\nEnglish writers bitterly complain of their intemperance. Almost every village had\nits still where strong spirits were made from sugar, dates, and carrots. Many were\nhabitual drunkards, not one man in a hundred but drank spirits as regularly as a\nEuropean took wine. MacMurdo, Trans. Bom. Lit. Soc. II. 225.\n\n3 Except for their bravery, which has indeed been questioned (Mr. Williams,\nResident, 1821), and for their decent, manly, and prepossessing manners (Elphinstone's\nMinute, 1821, Bom. Gov. Pol. Rec. 49), the Jadejas were formerly credited with but\nfew good qualities. They are, says Milvi Muhammad Ali (1805), an idle set amusing\nthemselves day and night in eating opium and smoking, leaving their work to\nmanagers. 'The Jadejas,' says MacMurdo (1818), 'are a most ignorant and indolent\nrace. They possess neither the activity, the spirit, the sense of honour, nor the\njealousy of feudal rights and privileges, which were so remarkable in their ancestors.'\nTrans. Bom. Lit. Soc. II. 225. In 1837 Mrs. Postans (Cutch, 138) describes them as\nignorant, dissipated, proud, and cruel, their haggard faces betraying intemperance\nin liquor and opium. Since then, the decay of Musalm\u00e1n power, the example of\nseveral strictly Hindu R\u00e0os, the decline of infanticide, the division of land, and the\nspread of poverty have combined to make the Jadejas give up several of their dissipated\nand un-Hindu ways.\nare generally skilled sewers and embroiderers, and, except the poorer village J\u00e1dej\u00e1s, almost never appear in public. The younger women, who are married about sixteen, are generally, by the older women or the family priest, taught to read and write, and learn to sew and embroider. Most J\u00e1dej\u00e1s are land-holders, some of them large proprietors, but very many, by want of thrift, and unceasing division of property reduced to be labourers or paupers.\n\nIn their religion the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s, except a few Vaishnavs, and a still smaller number of Svamin\u00e1rayans, are half-Hindu half-Musalm\u00e1n. Like Hindus they worship Vishnu, Shiv, the sun, \u00c1sh\u00e1pura, and other goddesses and the snake, the most gorgeous festival in the year being the R\u00e1o\u2019s procession to the snake temple in the Bhujia fort. Of their former Musalm\u00e1n beliefs and practices nothing remains but the reverence for some Musalm\u00e1n saints, and the occasional marriage with Musalm\u00e1n families. They show great respect to their priests, Br\u00e1hmans of the R\u00e1jgor sub-division, and to Bh\u00e1ts or B\u00e1rots and Ch\u00e1rans, their family bards and chroniclers. The J\u00e1dej\u00e1s\u2019 names and their ceremonies at birth, marriage, and death, are Hindu. Considering themselves of one stock, the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s do not intermarry, the only exception being that they marry with the Chud\u00e1sm\u00e1s, and the Kers one of the somewhat despised offshoots of the J\u00e1deja tribe known as Dangs. The J\u00e1dej\u00e1s take in marriage the daughters of V\u00e1ghela, Sodha, and Gohil Rajputs. Formerly (1819) they freely took the daughters of Musalm\u00e1ns, but this practice is said to have now died out. Since infanticide has been repressed, they have begun to marry their daughters to Jh\u00e1l\u00e1, Choh\u00e1n, Jethva, R\u00e1thod, V\u00e1ghela, Parm\u00e1r, Sodha, Mahida, Ch\u00e1vda, Gohil, Sindhal, Solanki, Savaiya, and as already mentioned, to Chud\u00e1sm\u00e1 and Ker husbands. Among the rich the girl\u2019s father pays the bridegroom a sum of money. But among the poor such a payment is not generally required. Well-to-do J\u00e1dej\u00e1s have little difficulty in finding husbands for their daughters. Polygamy is allowed and practised, but, except that the Abd\u00e1s and some Hothis allow a younger brother to marry the widow of his elder brother, widow marriage is forbidden. Musalm\u00e1n historians notice two customs as peculiar to the\n\n---\n\n1 The character of J\u00e1deja women would seem to have improved. Early English writers describe them in the blackest terms as stained by the practice of infanticide, abortion, and adultery. MacMurdo. Trans. Bom. Lit. Soc. II. 234.\n\n2 The state of the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s seems worse than in 1821. Already by the practice of sub-dividing land, some were reduced to poverty, but they were on the whole prosperous; not many were much in debt, they had few disputes, and no private wars. Elphinstone\u2019s Minute. Bom. Gov. Pol. Rec. 49 of 1820-21.\n\n3 The J\u00e1dej\u00e1s have for long been half Hindus half Musalm\u00e1ns. At the time of Mahmud Begada\u2019s conquest (1472), though appearing pagans in their practice, they were anxious to learn the true doctrines of Isl\u00e1m, to some heretical form of which they had long been converted. In Akbar\u2019s time (1590) they were still Musalm\u00e1ns (\u00c1\u00edn-i-Akbari, II. 72), and till the beginning of the present century they were quite as much Musalm\u00e1n as Hindu. In 1818 they took oaths on the Kur\u00e1n, considered it an authority in law and morals, followed its rules about eating, married freely with Musalm\u00e1n families, and worshipped in mosques. (MacMurdo. Trans. Bom. Lit. Soc. II. 237). Since then under the influences noted above (p. 63, note 3), they have, to a great extent, gone back to their first faith.\n\n4 The Sodha women of Thar and P\u00e1rk\u00e1r, formerly (1819) the favourite object of choice, are now less often sought in marriage than Jh\u00e1l\u00e1 women, probably because Jh\u00e1l\u00e1s are less expensive brides.\nJ\u00e1dej\u00e1s. In any desperate enterprise several of them, wearing saffron-coloured turbans, used to vow to conquer or die; again when the fortune of battle went against them and defeat was certain, the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s sometimes dismounted, tied their waist-bands together, locked their shields in front of them, and grasped their spears. As the governing class of the country the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s have a strong clan feeling, and, in spite of their disputes with him, a deep respect for their head the R\u00e1o. Under the R\u00e1o is the brotherhood, bh\u00e1y\u00e1d, of smaller chiefs, bound to yield him military service, on succession presented by him with a sword and a turban, but, except on the accession of a new prince, paying no rent or tribute. On his own estate each of these petty chiefs has, until lately, been independent, exercising police and magisterial powers over his people. Lately, as is shown below (p. 188), the chiefs have been arranged into classes according to their wealth and establishments, and they have been vested with fixed and graded powers. In the families of all the chiefs, including His Highness the R\u00e1o's family, each son can claim a share in the estate. The younger families of each branch owe military service, not to the R\u00e1o, but to the head of their branch; and, except in the matter of military service, the chiefs of the different branches have no power over the younger members of their branch. In his own village each landlord is independent. Still the head of the branch has a position of respect, and is chosen referee in disputes. Though improving as cultivators, and giving most of their children some Gujarati schooling, the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s do not take to trade or to crafts; and from their increase in numbers and the constant division of estates are, on the whole, a declining community.\n\nOf the same stock as J\u00e1dej\u00e1s, the Dangs hold a lower place, and differ from them in letting their women appear in public, in allowing widow marriage, in more freely giving their daughters to Musalm\u00e1ns, and in more widely adopting Musalm\u00e1n beliefs and practices. Otherwise, except that they are rougher and poorer, they do not differ from the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s in food, dress, or customs. Without thrift or forethought, none of them give their children any schooling and show few signs of improvement.\n\nOf the Dang clans, Abd\u00e1s (390) are partly sprung from Abd\u00f3 and partly from J\u00e1m Abda, fifth in descent from J\u00e1m J\u00e1da, who gave his name to the district of Abd\u00e1sa; A'mars, sprung from \u00c1marji are partly J\u00e1dej\u00e1s partly Dangs; and B\u00e1r\u00e1chs, Hindus and Musalm\u00e1ns from B\u00e1r\u00e1chji the son of Mulv\u00e1ji. There are also Bhojdes; Butt\u00e1s, chiefly in Abd\u00e1sa and Garda, now Musalm\u00e1ns; Ohhugers found in the west about Lakhp\u00e1t and Kora; Dals, Hindus and Musalm\u00e1ns; Gajans, Musalm\u00e1ns sprung from Gajanji, the fourth in descent from L\u00e1kha J\u00e1deja; G\u00e1h\u00e1s found in Abd\u00e1sa; Hothis, sprung from Hoth\u00edji, second in descent from J\u00e1m L\u00e1kha,\n\n---\n\n1 Elliot's History, I. 537. The first of these is common among other Rajput tribes.\n2 Dang in common use means a meeting or gathering, as Samm\u00e1no dang, a meeting of Samm\u00e1s. The J\u00e1dej\u00e1s seem to apply the word to the lower Samma tribes in the scornful sense of the many, the mass, the mob.\nand found in Lakhat and K\u00e1nthi; J\u00fad\u00e1s an offshoot from the main clan of J\u00e1dej\u00e1s; Jesars land-owners, mulgir\u00e1s\u00edas, found about Navin\u00e1l and Ber\u00e1ja; Kanaddes found in V\u00e1gad; K\u00e1y\u00e1s living about Vadva; Kers (see H\u00e1l\u00e1s), now Musalm\u00e1ns, land-holders in Pipar and Gholai in Garda; K\u00e1ndagr\u00e1rs early Rajput settlers living about the village of K\u00e1ndagra; Mok\u00e1s an offshoot of the Mokalsi Rajputs found about Bibbar and Aral; P\u00e1yers living about Roha; Pas\u00e1yas a branch of the Kanaddes found in V\u00e1gad; Reladiyas living about Vinjan; Sindhuls, a branch of Sodh\u00e1s, found in Khadir, V\u00e1gad, and K\u00e1nthi; Varamsis, an offshoot of the Samm\u00e1s, found in Garda and P\u00e1var; and Verars found about P\u00e1var and Lakhat.\n\nOther branches of the Samma tribe are Ded\u00e1s, H\u00e1l\u00e1s, Mods, and Ustiy\u00e1s. The Deda's, or Virbhadras (566), are an early offshoot from the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s sprung from Deda, second in descent from J\u00e1m L\u00e1kha. They are found in V\u00e1gad, Machhuk\u00e1nth\u00e1, and H\u00e1l\u00e1r. The chief town of their headman is Kanthkot. They pride themselves on the martial and enterprising spirit of their ancestors. H\u00e1'la's (1050) are sprung from H\u00e1'l\u00e1ji, son of Gajanji, second in descent from J\u00e1m L\u00e1kha. H\u00e1'l\u00e1ji, after a long struggle, subdued all the villages in the south, middle, and west of Cutch. J\u00e1m R\u00e1val, a descendant of this H\u00e1'l\u00e1ji, conquered the west of K\u00e1thiaw\u00e1r, named it H\u00e1l\u00e1r, and made Nav\u00e1nagar his capital. He is the ancestor of the present J\u00e1m. Such H\u00e1l\u00e1s as remained in Cutch enjoy some villages in K\u00e1nthi and H\u00e1l\u00e1chovisi. Mods (560), the descendants of Mod, the brother of Abda, are land-owners, mulgir\u00e1s\u00edas, in the Mod\u00e1sa district. Mod became a convert to Isl\u00e1m and undertook an expedition to H\u00e1l\u00e1r, where he died. His body was brought to Mod\u00e1sa and over his tomb a mosque has been raised, where he is worshipped by the Mods.\n\nSodh\u00e1s, 4657 strong, both Hindus and Muhammadans, are found in the north of the province. A division of the Parm\u00e1r tribe, they are generally supposed to be the Sogdoi or Sodr\u00e6 found by Alexander (325 B.C.) below the confluence of the five Panj\u00e1b rivers. At one time holding a large territory in Upper Sind, of which Aror was the capital, they were gradually, between the eighth and thirteenth centuries, driven south-east by the Musalm\u00e1n conquerors. They continued to rule at Umarkot in the desert till they were defeated and driven out by the Sind K\u00e1lhor\u00e1s about 1750. A branch of them entered Gujar\u00e1t early in the fourteenth century, and, in reward for help given to the V\u00e1ghela chief of Wadhw\u00e1n, were presented with the estates of Muli, Than, Chotila, and Chov\u00e1ri. At the beginning of the present century the Cutch Sodh\u00e1s were in a very\n\n---\n\n1 These Ded\u00e1s who live near Shikarpur are called K\u00e1l\u00e1s.\n2 Tod's R\u00e1jasth\u00e1n, I. 85; MacMurdo, Jour.

The men are tall, strongly made, and somewhat swarthy, the women famous for their beauty. They talk Cutchi, and in dress and food do not differ from other Cutch Rajputs. Settled in small numbers in the north of Cutch and in some of the Ran islands they are, except a few cultivators, chiefly herdsmen, most of them in poor condition. Their chief connection with Cutch is through the marriage of their daughters with the leading Jadeja and Musalm\u00e1n families. Of great natural abilities and much personal beauty the Sodha women are ambitious and intriguing, according to MacMurdo, not scrupling to make away with their husbands that their sons may obtain the estate. Sodhas never intermarry, but take wives from the Dya, Khauri, Solanki, Chohan, Rathod, and Vaghela Rajputs. They are entirely without education. Ra'mdepotras, 53, a distinct sub-division of Sodhas, are found in Khavda.\n\nThe Gujar\u00e1t Rajputs (16,517) of Cutch belong to two main divisions, one composed of Chavdas, Solankis and Vaghelas the representatives of the ruling tribes of Anhilvada, the other including a number of tribes locally known as Gujars supposed to have settled in Cutch when it was under Anhilvada rule (746-1304). The classes locally known as Gujars, 8437, though none of them are of the Gujar tribe, are found chiefly in the seven Vaghela towns of Gedi, Palansva, Jatavada, Bela, Bhimasar, Umio, and Kidianagar; in the two Hamirpars; and in the Jadeja towns of Kanmer, Chitrod, and Rav. Eating with Paraja Brahmins, Ahirs, Malis, Suthars, Luhars, Rabaris, Bharvads, Darjis, Ojha Kumbhars, and Atits, they allow widow marriage and let their women appear in public. Of the three formerly ruling tribes, who dine but do not marry with the Gujars, the Cha'vda's, 800, probably came from Panchasar in Palanpur, the seat of\n\n---\n\n1 Details are given below p. 163.\n2 Trans.

Except those that are offshoots of the same clan all these tribes intermarry.\n5 The Gujars, who have given their name to the Bombay province of Gujar\u00e1t, as well as to the district of Gujar\u00e1t in the Panjab, are differently described as aborigines, as half Rajputs half A'hirs, and as whole Rajputs. (Elliot's Races, N.W.P., I. 99). General Cunningham would trace them to the Indo-Skythian tribe of Yachi or Tochari who ruled in the north-west of India about the beginning of the Christian era (about 56 B.C.-200 A.D.) and who probably had a kingdom to the east of the lower Indus between the fifth and eighth centuries A.D. (Arch. Rep. II. 64-70). Though very few of the Gujar tribe, perhaps none except a small clan of Gujar Vanias, are found in Bombay Gujar\u00e1t, they form about one-fifth of the population of the Panjab where they are all Musalmans. They are also a very large tribe in the North-West Provinces. A strong manly class, pastoral rather than agricultural, they were, until lately, notorious thieves and robbers. Elliot's Races, I. 99, and Cunningham's Arch. Rep. II. 64.\nChapter III.\n\nPopulation.\n\nRajputs.\n\nCh\u00e1vd\u00e1s.\n\nJayshikhri the father of the renowned Vanr\u00e1j (746-806). The origin of the Ch\u00e1vd\u00e1s or Ch\u00e1potkats, who belong neither to the lunar nor the solar race and who according to their own legendary account are Agnikulas, is traced to the west of the Indus. They first appeared at Okh\u00e1mandal in north-west K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, then ruled in Diu and P\u00e1tan Somn\u00e1th in south K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, and, about the sixth century, retired to Panch\u00e1sar on the eastern shore of the Ran. Whatever their origin, they were, in their time of prosperity (746-942) as kings of Anhilv\u00e1da, admitted to a very high rank among Rajputs marrying even the daughters of the Gehlots of Meyw\u00e1r. When, in 942, the Ch\u00e1vd\u00e1s lost Anhilv\u00e1da, one of S\u00e1matsing\u2019s cousin\u2019s wives, by tribe a Bh\u00e1ti\u00e1ni, fled with her infant son to her father\u2019s house at Jesalmir. This boy, named Ah\u00edpat, on reaching manhood became a formidable outlaw. Taking nine hundred villages in Cutch he made Morgadh his capital and ruled there for many years. The last chief of this house was Punj\u00e1ji who lived in the reign of Al\u00e1-ud-din Khilji (1295-1315). In the fourteenth century the Samm\u00e1s and J\u00e1dej\u00e1s spread over Cutch and wrested their fortresses from the Ch\u00e1vda chieftains. In 1818 the Ch\u00e1vd\u00e1s were little known in Cutch. They had fallen to be owners of some trifling estate, gir\u00e1s, held rather as servants, khav\u00e1s, of the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s than as lords of the soil. At present, 1876, Ch\u00e1vd\u00e1s are almost all either Rajput servants or Muhammadan soldiers. In all Cutch there are only eight houses of pure Ch\u00e1vda descent. While the province was under the Solanki kings of Anhilv\u00e1da (942-1240) many families of that great tribe settled in Cutch. The only trace of them is in the names of some of the Rajput household servants. The V\u00e1\u2019ghela\u2019s, 1746, a branch of the Solankis, who about 1240 overthrew the ruling family of Anhilv\u00e1da and retained power till the close of the century, included part at least of Cutch in their dominions.

The northern branch of the great Solanki tribe conquered Guj\u00e1rat in 942, and in (472 A.D.) the southern or Ch\u00e1lukya branch had established its sway as far north as the N\u00e1rbada.

They suffered much at the hands of the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s, and of their tribe only about a dozen families are left of which Ged\u00ed is the head. Except that they are somewhat less strict in matters of caste, a result of their closer connection with Musalm\u00e1ns and half-Musalm\u00e1n J\u00e1dej\u00e1s, the Cutch V\u00e1ghel\u00e1s do not in customs or in way of living differ from ordinary Gujar\u00e1t Rajputs. Besides Ch\u00e1vd\u00e1s and Solankis their daughters marry Jh\u00e1l\u00e1s and J\u00e1dej\u00e1s, and lately, in a few cases, Musalm\u00e1ns. To these three tribes may be added the Gohils, of whom there are two houses of pure blood and many that have fallen into the position of family servants, khav\u00e1s. These four clans intermarry, speak the same language, wear the same dress, eat the same food, and have the same birth, marriage, and death customs.\n\nSangh\u00e1rs, 1321, with ten sub-divisions are found in Central Cutch. Details are given below (p. 95) under the head \"Musalm\u00e1ns.\"\n\nUnder Husbandmen came four classes with a strength of 43,588 souls or 11.82 per cent of the whole Hindu population. Of these 29,466 were Kanbis; 1619 Sathv\u00e1r\u00e1s; 1047 M\u00e1lis; and 11,456 Kolis.\n\nKanbis, 29,466, are found in the east and west of the province. Of the whole number, 13,814 are the half Musalm\u00e1n half Hindu Momna Kanbis, an account of whom is given below under the head \"Musalm\u00e1ns.\" Of the rest 13,864 are Lev\u00e1s and 1788 \u00c1njn\u00e1s. Except that they have no windows and no separate cook-room, their houses are much the same as those of V\u00e1n\u00ed peasants. Besides their dwellings, most families have a steading, v\u00e1di, where some of the young men sleep, and where the plough cattle and most of the fodder and fuel are kept. In dress the Kanbi is like the V\u00e1n\u00ed, only that instead of a waist cloth, he wears loose trousers, chorna. Their chief meal is taken in the fields about eight in the morning, some of it being left to be finished about noon. Like the Bhans\u00e1li, when hard-worked, the Leva eats a specially large share of clarified butter, and in the cold weather takes sweet oil with his bread. He smokes and chews tobacco, but neithereats meat nor takes liquor or opium. Almost all of them are husbandmen excelling in patient hard work. They are thrifty and prosperous, most of them having, besides their plough cattle, two cows and one or two buffaloes, and many of them some store of buried treasure. Except in the cold weather when he is less busy, he begins work at daybreak, breakfasts about eight, rests for an hour, eats and rests again at noon, and then works on till dark. The women help in the fields bringing their husbands' breakfast and working with them till evening. Lev\u00e1s are careful to keep the rules about washing, bathing often, at least on the eleventh,\n\n---\n\n1 Ind. Ant. V. 173. Arch. Rep. 1874-75, 193. Trans. Bom. Lit.

Driven out of Piram by Muhammad Tughl\u00edk (1347) two leading Gujar\u00e1t branches still remain, the chiefs of R\u00e1jpipla in Rewa K\u00e1ntha, and of Bh\u00e1vnagar in K\u00e1thi\u00e1war.\n3 Bedadiya, Bhir\u00edo, Chandroga, Dhame, Gal\u00e1nga, Jakhania, Kaman, N\u00e1gda, S\u00e1ya, Sniya.\n4 Besides the regular cultivating classes, most Osv\u00e1l V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s and Bhans\u00e1lias, and some Suth\u00e1rs, Kumbh\u00e1rs, Bh\u00e1vs\u00e1rs, A'hirs, Bharv\u00e1ds, and other low classes live by tillage. See p. 107.\nagiaras, of each fortnight. They rest their bullocks on the 30th, amavasya, of every month, but themselves take only three holidays in the year. Their family goddess is Amba Bhavani, but many are Svaminarayans, who at harvest time set apart some grain for the temple, and at least once go on pilgrimage to Narayanpur or Ahmedabad. Boys are betrothed before two and married before eight, and often in their first year. Besides the bride's jewelry, marriages generally cost from \u00a37 to \u00a310 (Rs. 70 - 100). Births are recorded by Bhatas who are paid sixpence for registering the birth of the eldest son. Widow marriage is allowed. Among Leva Kanbis, if there is more than one grown son, the property is divided. A certain amount, generally about \u00a35, is set apart for the funeral expenses of the father and mother, and they live with their sons in turn. The parents take no part in the house management, and the mother-in-law, if she quarrels with her son's wife, is made to live in a separate part of the house and is supplied with cooked food. Anjna Kanbis, originally Rajputs, are less skilful, hardworking, and well-to-do than the Lev\u00e1s. Vaishnavs in religion, they allow widow marriage, and have a headman, patel, who settles their disputes. Sathvarama's, 1619, said to have come from Patan in Kathiawar about 700 years ago, and Malis, 1047, are very insignificant classes. Kolis, 1145, are found chiefly in Vagad. They are of many clans, and probably the Babria Kolis, who have given their name to Babriavad the south division of Kathiawar and are thought to be the Barbaras of Sanskrit writers, came from Cutch. Some at least of the Koli clans would seem to be descended from the Mheds, Mers, or Mands, the most powerful tribe of lower Sind at the time of the Arab conquest (712). Formerly the Cutch Kolis used to live by robbery, but of late years they have almost all settled as cultivators and labourers.\n\nOf Craftsmen there were ten classes with a strength of 31,066 souls or 8.43 per cent of the whole Hindu population. Of these 3942 were Sonis, gold and silversmiths; 2094 Kansaras, coppersmiths; 5207 Suthars, carpenters; 3407 Luhars, blacksmiths; 3268 Darjis, tailors; 11,163 Kumbhars, potters; 198 Sompora Salats, masons; 555 Bhavsars, calico printers; 681 Vanjas, weavers of silk-cloth, mashru; and 101 Ghanchas, makers of bamboo baskets.\n\nSonis, goldsmiths, do not, as in other parts of Gujarat, belong to one class. Besides the regular Sonis, 3530, known as Vanja Sonis, there are two classes of goldsmiths, Kansa Sonis and Musalmans Sonis, and in Bhuj, some of the best silver workers are of the blacksmith, carpenter, and shoemaker castes. The regular Sonis claim to have once been Vanjas and say that about 1000 years ago they took to working in gold and silver, and so came to be called Sonis. They make and paint gold, silver, and jewelled ornaments. They are in middling condition with yearly incomes varying from \u00a313 to \u00a375 (Rs. 130 - 750). Though some worship goddesses, the greater part are followers of Gosainji.\n\n---\n\n1 Ind. Ant. III. 228, IV. 193.

Rep. 1874-75, 192.\nTheir family goddess is V\u00e1gheshvari. The caste has five headmen with power to enforce caste rules, and, with the concurrence of four respectable members of the caste, to punish petty offences by fines varying from \\(7\\frac{1}{2}\\) d. to 3s. (5 ans.-Re. 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)), and graver breaches of the rules by fines of as much as \u00a33 (Rs. 30).\n\nP\u00e1tmi Sonis, 412 in number, claim to be Songhad Rajputs who, at the advice of Sidhr\u00e1j Jaysing (1094-1148), followed the profession of goldsmiths. They are a sub-division of Parajia Sonis and are called P\u00e1tmi from having lived at P\u00e1tan. They have branches called Choh\u00e1n and R\u00e1thod. Some are goldsmiths, some carpenters, some stone masons, and some husbandmen. They are in middling condition, their yearly earnings varying from \u00a39 to \u00a350 (Rs. 90-500). Some of them are followers of Vishnu, some of Sv\u00e1min\u00e1r\u00e1yan, and some of goddesses. Different families have different family goddesses, Hingl\u00e1j, Momai, and Asir, and some have as their guardian spirit, Khetarp\u00e1l, the god of boundaries, or a Musalm\u00e1n saint. The men wear the sacred thread being girt with it generally at the time of marriage, but with no special ceremony. They allow widow marriage and polygamy. Those who reverence Moslem saints, though they bury their dead, are still recognized as members of the caste.\n\nKansa'ra's, with a total strength of 2094 men, claim to have once been Kshatris, and state that, during some time of trouble, they took to the calling of coppersmiths, Kans\u00e1r\u00e1s, on the advice of the goddess Mah\u00e1k\u00e1li. They claim to belong to the M\u00e1ru or M\u00e1rw\u00e1r tribe of Kans\u00e1r\u00e1s which they say has eighty-four branches, twenty-four of them in Cutch. They have no intercourse with goldsmiths and silversmiths. Their yearly earnings are said to be about \u00a36 (Rs. 60). They are followers of goddesses with Mah\u00e1k\u00e1li as their chief divinity. They allow widow marriage. They have two headmen, patels, but allow them no independent authority.\n\nGujar Suthares, 2322, claim to be descended from Gujar, the third son of Vishvakarma the divine \u2018world-builder,\u2019 and state that they were once stone masons as well as carpenters, but gave up stone cutting because of an attack made on them when Sidhr\u00e1j Jaysing had engaged them in building his Rudram\u00e1l. Their caste has, they say, 1000 sub-divisions. Most are carpenters, but some work in gold and silver and repair clocks and watches. They are in middling condition with yearly incomes varying from \u00a313 to \u00a350 (Rs. 130-500). Some follow Shiv, some R\u00e1m\u00e1nand, some Vishnu, and some\n\n---\n\n1 This goddess is traditionally believed to have created two persons both of them Vani\u00e1s. The elder took to making ornaments and was called Soni, and the younger taking to trade was called Vepdri.\n2 The four tribes of Kans\u00e1r\u00e1s are according to these people Marni, Ahmedahadi, Surati, and K\u00e1kreji.\n3 A book on their caste, called Vishvakarma, says that about 3000 years ago when their caste was formed, their ancestors washed regularly, repeated the most sacred text, gayatri mantra, and performed other ceremonies like Br\u00e1hmans, and like them were divided into families, gotras, and branches, sh\u00e1khi\u00e1s.\n4 Among them are Ah\u00e1sn\u00e1s, Ag\u00e1r\u00e1s, Bakr\u00e1ni\u00e1s, Bh\u00e1rdiy\u00e1s, Dudhai\u00e1s, Gharvali\u00e1s, Limbosi\u00e1s, V\u00e1gadi\u00e1s, Pin\u00e1r\u00e1s, and Vadg\u00e1m\u00e1s. These are now family names rather than clan or tribe divisions.\nSvaminarayan. Different families have different goddesses such as Verai Mata and Dhargad Mata. They allow widow marriage. They have no headman, patel, caste meetings being called at the instance of four respectable members. MA'RA'DI SUTHA'RS, 325, claim to have been Marwar Rajputs who took to carpentry when Parshuram resolved to destroy the Kshatris. They are of six branches, Bambari, Bhati, Chohan, Rathod, Solanki, and Tur. Though some work in wood their chief occupation is husbandry. Their yearly earnings are estimated at from \u00a310 to \u00a313 (Rs. 100-130). They all worship goddesses; different families having different guardians the commonest being Chamun, Matag, Solanki, Vatchrau, and Bhanibhau. One of their after-death ceremonies is peculiar. On the twelfth day twelve earthen jars full of water, each with a metal pot, taneli, containing cooked food, are given to Brahmins, who after making a male and female calf walk round the jars, take away the pots leaving the cooked food to the boys of the caste. They allow widow marriage, and have a headman, patel, with very limited authority. AHIR SUTHA'RS, 2560, say that they once were Ahir Kshatris and took to carpentry when Parshuram destroyed the Kshatris. They are of six tribes, Chohan, Avadya, Fagnishia, Ghati, Bhala, and Todhorya. They live as carpenters and husbandmen and are in middling circumstances, their yearly earnings varying from \u00a320 to \u00a350 (Rs. 200-500). Almost all of them worship goddesses, their guardian deity being Mahamaya whose chief place of worship is the village of Umiya. They allow widow marriage and polygamy, and have no headman, the caste choosing some of their number to settle disputes.\n\nGUJAR LUHA'RS, 8407, claim to be of Kshatri descent. Sprung from some Kshatris who, fearing to fall victims to Parshuram, joined the Luhars and took up the calling of blacksmiths. The caste has ten branches, Balsora, Gohil, Kapya, Makvana, Maru, Parmar, Pudaria, Rathod, Solanki, and Umrasia, and two sub-divisions, Suratiya and Machhu-Kacha. Most are blacksmiths, some carpenters, and some workers in gold and silver. Though some follow Svaminarayan, most worship goddesses. Bhavani Mata, who founded their caste and calling, is their family goddess. The men wear the sacred thread being girt with it at marriage without any special ceremony. The caste allows widow marriage and polygamy, has a headman, patel, with little authority and settles disputes at mass meetings.\n\nDARJIS, 3268 strong, claim to be sprung from Kshatris who to escape Parshuram's vengeance became tailors. There are nine branches, Chavda, Dabhi, Galecha, Gohil, Lakadia, Parmar, Rathod, Solanki, and Sonara. Though some are carpenters, most earn a living as tailors. They are a poor class with yearly incomes varying from \u00a36 to \u00a310 (Rs. 60-100). Most worship goddesses, but\n\n---\n\n1 Tradition has it that the Luhar was created by Bhavani to prepare the discus to kill a demon who was proof against all other weapons.\nsome follow Trikamji, and some Svaminarayan. Hinglaj, whose chief place of worship is Bhuj, is their family goddess. On the sixth day after birth a pair of scissors covered with cloth is laid down and the child made to bow before them. At marriages the bridegroom elect walks to the house of the bride. They perform no ceremonies at the time of death, but on the eleventh day grain and clothes are given to Brahmins. They allow widow marriage. They have a headman, patel, but give him little authority and settle disputes at a mass meeting of the caste.\n\nCharakia Kumbha's, 8216 strong, are bricklayers, but mostly husbandmen. They are in middling condition with yearly incomes varying from \u00a38 to \u00a350 (Rs. 80 - 500). In religion chiefly Ramanandis some of them believe in Thakor Mandvi. Their family goddess is Brahmani. They allow polygamy and widow marriage, and have a headman, patel, with little authority. Ojha Kumbha's, 1892 strong, say that their caste takes its origin from Brahma and is about a thousand years old. Most of them live by making earthen pots. They are poor, with yearly incomes varying from \u00a35 to \u00a318 (Rs. 50 - 180). They worship goddesses, Chavan Mata being their family goddess. On the sixth day after birth a clay horse is prepared, a round mark made on the child's forehead with oxide of lead, and the child made to bow before the horse. They allow widow marriage and polygamy, and have a headman, patel, with very little authority.\n\nKumbha's Salats, formerly inhabitants of Navanagar were called in by the Rao of Cutch, because the Sompura Salats were behind with their work. They claim to be sprung from Kshatris, who, to escape Parshuram, saved themselves by pretending to be potters. They afterwards took to stone cutting and formed a separate caste. There are eight branches, Balsod, Bhatti, Choh\u00e1n, Gohil, Kacha, Rathod, Solanki, and Tank. Most of them living as stone masons are poor, their yearly earnings varying from \u00a36 to \u00a318 (Rs. 60 - 180). Except a few who follow Svaminarayan and Ramanand, they worship goddesses, their favourite family guardians being Amba, Chavan, and P\u00e1rvati, whose chief place of worship is at Navanagar. Widow marriage is allowed. The caste has no headman, patel, four respectable members managing its affairs.\n\nBhavsa's or Chhipa's, 555 strong, claim to be of Kshatri descent and are of five branches, Bhatti, Choh\u00e1n, Gohil, Parm\u00e1r, and Rathod. Tailoring and husbandry are their chief occupations. They are poor, their yearly earnings varying from \u00a37 10s. to \u00a312 10s. (Rs. 75 - 125). They all worship goddesses. Choal Mata is their family goddess and her weapon a trident, trishul, is kept\n\n---\n\n1 The Bhavsars have a tradition that when Parshuram was exterminating the Kshatri race they were Rajputs living at Brij Mathura. Fearing their fate they became followers of one Ram Devji a mendicant, and came to Marwar. This Ram Devji being a calender, Chhipa, his followers were at first called Chhipas. Their present name they derived from their having placed faith, bhav, in this mendicant.\nby every Bh\u00e1vs\u00e1r at his house. The caste allows widow marriage and polygamy, and, without any headman, settles disputes at a mass meeting.\n\nGha'noha's, 101 strong, claiming descent from a V\u00e1nia mother and a Rajput father, get their name from making bamboo baskets, gh\u00e1ncha, to hold flowers for their family goddess Bahuchar\u00e1ji. They are of three branches, Solanki, Jh\u00e1la, and Padhiar. They are poor, but not forced to beg. Followers of M\u00e1ta, their family goddess is Bahuchar\u00e1ji, whose chief place of worship is Chuv\u00e1l near Virang\u00e1m, where she has a handsome temple built by a grateful Rajput whose infant daughter the goddess is said to have changed into a son. The caste has a headman, patel.\n\nVa'nja's, 681 strong, weavers of silk cloth, mashru, claim to be Kshatris the descendants of the great Sahasr\u00e1jijn of Pur\u00e1nic fame. They are in middling condition earning yearly incomes varying from \u00a36 to \u00a380 (Rs. 60 - 800). They worship goddesses, their family goddess being Hingl\u00e1j M\u00e1ta, whose chief place of worship is at a village on the sea shore about 100 miles (60 kos) west of Kurrahee. All do not wear the sacred thread, but some are invested with them before the goddess, and others for a fee of 6d. (4 as.) by Gos\u00e1n\u00edji Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j. They allow widow marriage and have a headman, patel, with very little authority. Disputes are settled at a mass meeting of the caste.\n\nUnder the head of Bards, Songsters and Actors came two classes with a strength of 9863 souls or 2\u00b767 per cent of the whole Hindu population. Of these 619 were Bh\u00e1ts and 9244 Cha'rans, bards and genealogists. There are two chief classes of Cutch bards, Bh\u00e1ts who are Hindus, and Dh\u00e1dis who are Musalm\u00e1ns. Bh\u00e1ts, on the whole a declining class, are of two kinds, Brahma Bh\u00e1ts and Dongra Bh\u00e1ts, both originally Kanojia Br\u00e1hmans. The Brahma Bh\u00e1ts though not now attached to any particular caste were originally the genealogists of the Loh\u00e1n\u00e1s, with whom and the Kshatris they dine. They are beggars, husbandmen, and soldiers, and do not allow widow marriage. The Dongra Bh\u00e1ts claim to have come to Cutch with the J\u00e1d\u00e9j\u00e1s, and are found chiefly in\n\n---\n\n1 According to the Hingol Pur\u00e1n the wives of Sahasr\u00e1jijn, the great Kshatri king, and of Jamadagni, the Br\u00e1hman sage and father of Parshur\u00e1m, were sisters. Once while fetching water, for her husband was poor, Renuka, the sage's wife, thought of her sister's grandeur and her own poverty. No sooner had she thought of this than the pitcher became empty. On her husband asking why the pitcher was empty, she told him she had thought of her sister's wealth and her own poverty, and the water leaked away. The sage told her she was wrong in thinking her sister better off than herself. She said 'if I want to ask my sister there is hardly food in the house for ten men.' The sage replied that he had food for ten thousand, but he did not think it wise to call a Kshatri to dinner. She persisted that they should be asked, and her sister and her husband came with a very large retinue. The sage with the help of his wish-fulfilling cow, and his never-empty jar satisfied the king and all his men. Learning the source of the sage's store of food, the king carried off the cow and the jar, and forced the sage to lie on a bed of pointed nails. Distressed at the ill effects of her persistence Renuka committed suicide, and her son Parshur\u00e1m, taking his axe, parshu, swore to destroy the whole race of Kshatris. He killed most of them, but some who took shelter, hiding behind the Hingl\u00e1j M\u00e1ta, were called V\u00e1nja from the V\u00e1nja, back, of the goddess which protected them.\nChi\u00e1sar and N\u00e1ndra in central Abd\u00e1sa, and Bhujpur in the K\u00e1nthi. They are now the genealogists of all the Samm\u00e1tri or Samma-sprung castes and live on small registering fees and yearly presents. They dine with Rajputs and Khav\u00e1s, and do not wear the sacred thread. Alike in their duties and accomplishments, singing festive songs prepared or improved in honour of marriages and other great occasions, reciting stories of the warlike deeds of the chiefs' forefathers, singing of love or telling old legends and tales of hairbreadth escapes, the Bh\u00e1t and the Dh\u00e1di differ in this, that the Bh\u00e1t recites or sings without, and the Dh\u00e1di with, the help of an instrumental accompaniment. There is also the difference that the Dh\u00e1dis are only singers, and the Bh\u00e1ts, besides being singers, are genealogists and sometimes historians.\n\nThe Cha'ran was, according to Hindu story, created by Shiv to tend four animals of opposite dispositions, a lion, a serpent, a cow, and a goat. The lion attacked the cow and the serpent attacked the lion, but the herdsman quieted them by the gift of some of the flesh of his arm and brought them safe to Shiv, who in reward gave him the name of the grazier, Ch\u00e1ran. In origin the Ch\u00e1rans would seem to be closely allied to the \u00c1hirs and K\u00e1th\u00eds; they are the bards of the K\u00e1th\u00eds, and address the \u00c1hirs as uncles, m\u00e1ma. According to a local story they reached Cutch about the same time as the K\u00e1th\u00eds, as R\u00e1m Parm\u00e1r of Telang\u00e1na (700) is said to have given Cutch to the Ch\u00e1rans. They are of three classes K\u00e1chhel\u00e1s, M\u00e1rus, and Tumers. The K\u00e1chhel\u00e1s, found in east Abd\u00e1sa about Manjal and K\u00e1npar, and in central Cutch, are money-lenders and traders. From their name, probably the first of the Ch\u00e1ran settlers in Cutch, they speak a dialect like that of the \u00c1hirs.\u00b9 The M\u00e1rus, from the desert in the north-east, are found about Bhuj and north Abd\u00e1sa including M\u00e1k.\u00b2 They speak a M\u00e1rv\u00e1di dialect and live as cultivators. The Tumers, the largest sub-division, found in the K\u00e1nthi and Abd\u00e1sa as far west as Jakh\u00e1u, are said to have come with the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s from Sind. They speak Cutchi and are the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s' family bards.\u00b3 They are fair, strong, and well made, not unlike Rajputs. The men dress like Cutch Rajputs in turban, p\u00e1gdi, jacket, kedio, trousers, chorno, and waistcloth, dhoti, and the women in a robe, thep\u00e1do, bodice, kamkho, and blackwool blanket, dh\u00e1bli, worn over the head. As bards, and as one of the self-mutilating castes, tr\u00e1ga varan, Ch\u00e1rans hold a high position. The Rajput allows him to smoke\n\n\u00b9 The following are examples of this peculiar dialect: \u092e\u093e\u092e\u0947 \u0928\u093e\u0932\u0924\u0947\u0938\u0947 or \u0915\u093e\u092f\u0941 \u0928\u093e\u0932\u0924\u0947\u0938\u0947 = \u092b\u093c\u093f \u0928\u093e\u0932\u091a\u0947; Where are you going? \u092d\u0948\u0938, \u092d\u0948\u0938 = sit; \u0917\u0941\u0921\u0940 = \u092e\u093e\u0938\u0940, Mother's sister; \u092e\u093e\u092f\u0941 = \u092c\u0940\u0928, sister; \u0924\u094d\u0930\u0941\u092a\u094d\u092a\u0930\u0924\u0947\u0938\u0947 = \u0925\u0941\u0902 \u0926\u093f\u091f\u094d\u091f\u0947. What are you doing?\n\n\u00b2 M\u00e1k or the dewy land, is the local name of a tract near Nakhtr\u00e1na in central Cutch famous for its heavy dews.\n\n\u00b3 Of the K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r Ch\u00e1rans Abul Fazl says (1590) 'in battle they repeat warlike tales to cheer the troops. They are better soldiers than the Bh\u00e1ts.' Gladwin's A'in-i-Abkari, II. 70.\nfrom his pipe,\u00b9 and he passes with his wares unharmed in times of trouble and lightly taxed in times of peace. Ch\u00e1ran women, supposed to have supernatural power, are by the lower classes addressed as m\u00e1ta, mother or mother-goddess, and several of them have after death become goddesses.\u00b2 Ch\u00e1rans are as a class clean and neat both in their dress and houses, and very manly and independent. Except the bards who are idle and given to opium, they are thrifty and hardworking. They are bards, landed proprietors, traders, and husbandmen. As bards they recite the praises of Rajputs in short rude pieces, some of them in reward holding large gifts of land. Leaving their women at home, as traders they take large caravans of bullocks north to M\u00e1rv\u00e1r and Hindust\u00e1n, and east through Gujar\u00e1t to M\u00e1lwa. Some of the bullocks are for sale, the rest are pack carriers taking ivory, cocoanuts, alum, and dry dates from Cutch, and bringing back corn and tobacco from M\u00e1rv\u00e1r and Gujar\u00e1t. By the opening of cart roads and railways this pack bullock traffic has of late greatly fallen off. Some of those who formerly had pack bullocks have now settled as traders and money-lenders. Others have taken to agriculture, but they are new to the work and very unskilled. No grazier Ch\u00e1rans are to be found in Cutch. They are very religious paying much respect to Br\u00e1hmins whom they employ as family priests. They chiefly worship the mother, m\u00e1ta, under many titles both in her well known forms of Bhav\u00e1mi, Amba, and P\u00e1rvati, and under local names.\u00b3 Their birth, marriage, and death customs are said not to differ from those of other Cutch Hindus. Widow marriage is allowed, and, especially among the Tumers, both by man and woman a divorce is very easily obtained. The K\u00e1chhel\u00e1s allow the widow of the elder brother to marry the younger, but among none of them does the custom of female succession prevail in preference to male. Each sub-division has its hereditary head, called the old man, ghardero, and settles caste disputes when a large company is met at some high feast.\n\nOf Personal Servants were there two classes with a strength of 7055 souls or 1\u00b791 per cent, of the whole Hindu population. Of these 1368 were V\u00e1\u2019lands, or Hajams, barbers,\u2074 and 5687 Khav\u00e1s, household servants. The Haja\u2019ms, poor and in small numbers, found in all parts of the province, do not differ from those of Gujar\u00e1t. The Khava\u2019s are the descendants of Rajputs who have lost their lands. As their wives have to appear in public and work in the fields, the better class of Rajputs will not give them their daughters in marriage. They have been forced to take women from the lower classes and to allow people who have lost caste or are of illegitimate birth to join them. Some of the Khav\u00e1s are the personal servants of chiefs, others are soldiers, husbandmen, and labourers. They are\n\n\u00b9 Mrs. Postans\u2019 Cutch, 238.\n\u00b2 The goddesses, Khodiy\u00e1r, Varudi, and Bahuchara, new worshipped in Cutch, were Ch\u00e1ran women.\n\u00b3 The chief Cutch \u2018Mothers\u2019 are Momaya, A\u2019sh\u00e1pura, Shiv Karniji, R\u00e1v R\u00e9y, Khodiy\u00e1r, Varudi, and Bahuchara. The last three are deified Ch\u00e1ran women.\n\u2074 Most Cutch barbers and all washermen, except a few Bh\u00e1vsars, are Musalm\u00e1ns.\nallowed to marry and cannot at the pleasure of their master be made over to another owner. A Khav\u00e1s, sometimes in famine years or when hopelessly indebted, binds himself to serve a chief as his servant. These people called Gol\u00e1s become for the rest of their lives the servants of the chief who feeds them, clothes them, and pays their expenses. Female servants seldom marry. Most of them are of easy virtue and the children become the servants of their parent's master, and may by him be handed over to his daughter as part of her dowry. The ranks of the Gol\u00e1s are also recruited from illegitimate children of all castes and in time of famine from children of destitute parents. They are well treated and lead easy lives, some of them gaining much influence over their masters.\n\nOf Herdsmen and Shepherds there were three classes with a total strength of 39,759 souls or 10\u00b778 per cent of the whole Hindu population. Of these 25,072 were \u00c1hirs, 13,371 Rab\u00e1ris, and 1316 Bharv\u00e1ds.\n\n\u00c1hirs, the Abhirs or cowherds of ancient Hindu writings, with a strength of 25,072 souls, are found north and east of Bhuj, east of K\u00e1nthi, and west of V\u00e1gad. Sprung, according to Manu, from a Br\u00e1hman man and an Ambastha or Vaid woman, according to the Brahma Pur\u00e1n from a Kshatriya father and a Vaisya mother, according to the Bhagvat Pur\u00e1n from Vaisya parents, and according to an old tradition from a Rajput slave girl and a Vaisya slave, they claim to be Vaisyas, but are by Br\u00e1hmans classed as Sudras. At present, besides in Cutch and K\u00e1thi\u00e1war they are found in large numbers in central India and Rajput\u00e1na, in many parts of the North-West Provinces, and east in Bengal. Though now depressed and of little consequence they were once a powerful class. \u00c1sa, the \u00c1hir ruler of Asirgad, connects them with the Shepherd kings or G\u00e1vli R\u00e1j\u00f3s of Kh\u00e1ndesh; they ruled in Central India near Mirz\u00e1pur and in Nep\u00e1l; they seem closely related to the great Buddhist dynasty of P\u00e1l, and according to the Vishnu Pur\u00e1n they were universal sovereigns reigning between the Andhra and the Gardabha dynasties. Traces of the \u00c1hirs are said to be found in the Abisares of Alexander's historians (325 B.C.), the ruler of the hills between Mari\n\n---\n\n1 Sanskrit writers use Abhir as a general term for the low caste population of the north-west of India.

They say that from Mathura they came with Krishna to Girn\u0101r in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, and, from there going to Thar and P\u0101rk\u0101r, finally ended in Cutch. Locally they are divided into five sub-tribes, Machhua, from the river Machhu near Morvi in north K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, living in the district of Anj\u0101r; Pr\u0101nthalia, living in V\u0101gad; Boricha in Kanthi; Sorathia, from Sorath in south K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, in and about Anj\u0101r; and Chorida, from the island of Chor\u0101d in the Ran, living in Adesar, Pal\u0101nsva, Sanwa, Umiyu, J\u0101tav\u0101da, Bela, and other parts of V\u0101gad.\u2074 These sub-divisions do not intermarry, but, except the Sorathi\u0101s who are held in disgrace because they once betrayed their chief R\u0101o Navghan to the Emperor of Delhi, they dine with each other. Well made, fair, and with high features their home tongue is a corrupt Gujar\u0101ti.\u2075 Poor, many of them sunk in debt, \u0100hirs generally live in small tiled houses with stone and mud walls, with a good store of cattle, but no furniture beyond bedding quilts, cots, and large earthen jars, the jars sometimes ornamented with figures and prettily arranged in rows. Except that the women are fond of wearing black robes, their dress does not differ from that of V\u0101nia cultivators. His ordinary food is much like that of the V\u0101nia and Kanbi, millet bread, and pulse, and millet with milk and vegetables. When he can afford it he drinks liquor and eats any flesh but that of the cow. Though he associates with\n\n\u00b9 Vivien de St. Martin, Geog. Greeque et Latine de l'Inde, 144; Cunningham's Arch. Rep. II. 23.\n\u00b2 Lassen says Ptolemy's Sabiria is the Abhira of Indian Geographers. (Jour. As. Soc. Beng. IX. 276.) But according to the usual account the Abhira of the Pur\u0101ns was the western coast of India, from the Tapti to Devagad. Elliot's Races, I. 2; Bird's Mirat-i-Ahmadi, 8. On the Allahabad pillar (about 200 B.C.) Abhira is mentioned next to Prardjuna in Upper Sind. St. Martin (as above), 161.\n\u00b3 Gen. Cunningham (Arch. Rep. II. 23-33) would trace both Abhis\u0101ra in the Panj\u0101b and Abhiria in Sind to the Ab\u0101rs or Sus the great Indo-Skythian race that conquered the Panj\u0101b and Sind in the second century B.C. According to him Alexander's Abhis\u0101ra, an Indianised form of Ab\u0101ris\u0101da, was called after a colony of Skythians of the Ab\u0101r horde transplanted from Hyrkania by Darius Hystaspes (498 B.C.) This branch of the Ab\u0101rs, he holds, are represented by the modern Gakars. In his opinion the Abhiria of Ptolemy, the Periplus, and the Hindu Geographers, took its name from the main body of the Ab\u0101rs or Sus who, in the second century B.C., conquered the Panj\u0101b and Sind, and about 100 years later were defeated by the Yuechi and their power confined to the lower Panj\u0101b and Sind, and who in his opinion are represented by the Jats and Meds. In support of General Cunningham's view it may be noticed that the last reading suggested for the doubtful passage in the Periplus is Abaratike not Abhiratike. (McCrindle's Periplus, and Cunningham's Arch. Rep. II. 49).\n\u2074 Ind. Ant. V. 168. K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r (1812) the \u0100hirs were divided into Nesaes who lived with cattle, and Gujars who lived in towns. The Nesaes marry their brother's widow.\n\u2075 The following sentences show some of the particulars in which the \u0100hir dialect\nMusalm\u00e1ns, almost all flesh-eating Hindu castes will dine with him. Thrifty, but not very hardworking, they are dirty in their ways and among themselves quarrelsome and spiteful. They have given up shepherding and though poor and with little skill, except a few who are carpenters, live as husbandmen. The women help by cleaning and spinning cotton. They worship goddesses, m\u00e1ta, and Krishna or Th\u00e1korji, and of local divinities Habb\u00e1y of the Habba hill fourteen miles north of Bhuj; Mekan, one of twelve ascetics who buried themselves alive at Dhrang eighteen miles north-east of Bhuj; and a Rajput saint called V\u00e1chara. They are said to observe no special forms of snake worship. Children are betrothed at any age and married between twelve and fifteen. Every year on one fixed day \u00c1hir marriages take place. On the marriage day the women of the family with singing bring a wooden image of Ganpati and place it in the marriage canopy. As the bridegroom's party drives up in carts the bride's relations come out to welcome them with singing. The ceremony is performed by a Parajia Br\u00e1hman, who gets a fee of 2s. 8d. (5 koris). The details do not differ from those observed at other Hindu marriages.

Of the North-West Province \u00c1hirs, Sir H. Elliot says (Races, I. 6), in Delhi the \u00c1hirs eat, drink, and smoke in common not only with J\u00e1ts and Gujars, but under a few restrictions with Rajputs. In other places Rajputs would repudiate all connection with \u00c1hirs. In some districts Br\u00e1hmans will take milk, water, and even food from certain \u00c1hirs.\n\n2 The North-West Province \u00c1hirs are still herdsmen, those of K\u00e1thi\u00e1war skilled cultivators.\n\n3 The rules vary in the different divisions. Among Pr\u00e1nthalia \u00c1hirs the day is always the same Vaish\u00e1kh vad 13th (April - May). In other sub-divisions the day varies, being fixed by their priests.\n\n4 These Br\u00e1hmans dine with the \u00c1hirs. They are said to have saved the \u00c1hirs at the time of Parshur\u00e1m's persecution by saying they were not Kshatriyas but the sons-in-law of Br\u00e1hmans.\nChapter III.\n\nPopulation.\n\nHerdsmen.\n\nA'hir.\n\nsound of the drum, dhol, the women dance in a circle, and the men go through a stick dance, d\u00e1ndiya r\u00e1s, moving in a circle and striking at each other with sticks. Two feasts are given by the bride's party and on the third day the bridegroom leaves taking his wife with him. Among them it is usual for a younger brother to marry his elder brother's widow. Some of the A'hir women are more independent than among the stricter Hindus, not covering their faces in presence of their elders and speaking freely with their husbands. Their births and marriages are registered by R\u00e1v\u00e1ls a kind of degraded Bh\u00e1ts. The caste has a headman who with a committee of the caste settles all disputes.

Their story, that they came to Cutch from Marw\u00e1r, is supported by the fact that the seat of their tribe goddess Sikotra is at Jodhpur.\u00b9 The story of their origin is that Shiv, while performing religious penance, tap, created a camel and a man to graze it. This man had four daughters, who married Rajputs of the Choh\u00e1n, Gambir, Solanki, and Parm\u00e1r tribes. These and their offspring were all camel graziers. Other Rajputs joined them and formed a separate caste. Besides Rab\u00e1ris and Bhop\u00e1s they are called Visotars, because at the time of the Parshur\u00e1m persecutions one of them saved the lives of twenty, vis, Kshatriyas. Their home tongue is Gujar\u00e1t\u00ed with some M\u00e1rv\u00e1di inflections. Tall and strongly made with high features and an oval face, the Rab\u00e1ri like the A'hir takes flesh and spirits, and does not scruple to eat with Musalm\u00e1ns. He lives for days almost solely on camels' milk.\u00b2 Except a black blanket over his shoulders the Rab\u00e1ri wears cotton clothes. His waistcloth, dhoti, is worn tucked through his legs, and not wound round the hips like a Rajput's. They live much by themselves in small hamlets of six or eight grass huts styled v\u00e1ndhs or ny\u00e9es. They are described as civil and obliging, honest, intelligent, contented, and kindly.\u00b3 They are very poor living on the produce of their herds.\u2074 They are a religious class, many of them acting as priests in M\u00e1't\u00f3s' temples. Each family has a she-camel called M\u00e1ta Meri, which is never ridden and whose milk is never given to any one\n\n\u00b9 Perhaps from their high features they are, according to one account, of Persian origin, and in support of this it is said that one of their family names is \u00c1'ga.\n\u00b2 Ind. Ant. V. 172.\n\u00b3 Tod's Western India, 324.\n\u2074 Col. Tod notices the cattle stealing habits of the desert Rab\u00e1ris. He says 'Rab\u00e1ri is known throughout Hindust\u00e1n only as denoting persons employed in rearing and tending camels who are always Moslems. Here they are a distinct tribe employed entirely in rearing camels or in stealing them, in which they evince a peculiar dexterity uniting with the Bh\u00e1ts in the practice. When they come upon a herd the boldest and most experienced strikes his lance into the first he reaches, then dips a cloth in the blood which at the end of his lance he thrusts close to the nose of the next and, wheeling about, sets off at speed followed by the whole herd lured by the scent of blood and the example of their leader.' Annals of R\u00e1jasth\u00e1n, II. 293.\nbut a Hindu. Like the \u00c1hirs they practise polygamy and allow widow marriage. They have a headman called shinai, but he has little authority and most disputes are settled by a mass meeting of the caste.\n\nBharv\u00e1ds, 1316, are found in the north-east of Cutch. According to their own story they are of the same caste as Krishna's foster father, and came to Cutch from the North-West Provinces. Their home tongue is Gujarati. As herdsmen of goats and sheep, as husbandmen and as labourers, they are fairly well off. They worship female deities, their tribe 'mother' being called Machhu. At the betrothal the father of the bride gives milk to the bridegroom's father and pays him 2s. 8d. (5 koris), and the bridegroom gives to the bride's mother \u00a31 1s. 4d. (40 koris). Among Bharv\u00e1ds the custom is for the poorer men to wait till a rich man's daughter is married, and then for all to marry their daughters on the same day, the rich man paying the expenses. They have a headman called mir, but settle disputes at mass meetings punishing abduction by excommunication and other breaches of caste rules by fine.\n\nOf Fishers and Sailors there were three classes with a strength of 1192 souls or 0\u00b732 per cent of the whole Hindu population. Of these 1143 were Kh\u00e1rv\u00e1s, sailors, and 49 M\u00e1chhis, fishermen.\n\nKh\u00e1rv\u00e1s's, or seamen, with a strength of 1143 souls, claim Rajput descent. They say that they fled from Ala-ud-din Khilji (1295-1315) into K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Cutch, and H\u00e1l\u00e1r. Taking to a sailor's life they did much to improve the knowledge of navigation among the Cutch seamen, and formed a separate caste. There are four branches, Jelhun, Jh\u00e1la, R\u00e1thod, and Solanki. They are excellent sailors going to many parts of the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, and even to Madagascar where Bh\u00e1tia, V\u00e1nia, and Bohora traders have long been settled. As a class they are said to be badly off. Most of them worship goddesses, the guardian of the R\u00e1thods being Rhoji, and of the Solankis, Ch\u00e1munda. All used to wear the sacred thread, but the practice was stopped because of the rule that no wearer of a sacred thread should live at sea. Four of them have been invested with it, three for going pilgrimages and the fourth for serving the Mah\u00e1rsj\u00e1s. On Shravan vad 10th, they set the image of the god Murli Manoharji in M\u00e1ndvi in a four-wheeled chariot, rath, and, drawing it to a pond, bathe it, and bring it back. They eat with all Rajputs except such as associate with Musalm\u00e1ns. They have a headman, patel, and under him a kotv\u00e1l, who calls caste meetings at the temple of Murli Manoharji.\n\n---\n\n1 The tradition is that they are of the same caste as Nand Mehr the foster father of Krishna and have emigrated from Gokul Vandr\u00e1van near Delhi to K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Cutch, and Gujar\u00e1t.\n\n2 Dr. J. Wilson in Bom. Adm. Rep. for 1872-73, 136.\n\n3 About a century ago Manoharji appeared to a Kh\u00e1rv\u00e1 in a dream and told him that his image had floated on shore. Search was made and the image set up in its present temple.\nOf Labourers and Miscellaneous Workers there were seven classes with a strength of 3155 souls or 0.85 per cent of the whole Hindu population. Of these 1579 were Bhils, 696 V\u00e1ghris, vegetable sellers, hunters and labourers found chiefly in V\u00e1gad; 591 R\u00e1vali\u00e1s or J\u00e1gari\u00e1s, tapeweavers; 259 Ods, diggers; 10 Thoris, woodcutters and beggars; 10 Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, servants, and 10 Kal\u00e1ls, liquor sellers. The Bhils originally from P\u00e1lanpur and living chiefly in the Bhuj Sadar Baz\u00e1r are palanquin bearers and labourers. The J\u00e1gari\u00e1s were formerly R\u00e1val Jog\u00eds, but their profession of weaving tape and beating drums, danks, led to the formation of a separate caste. It has six branches, Singara of 26 men, Makv\u00e1na of 19, Mepa of 14, Mujaria of 6, Nara of 5, and Mayatra of 4. They are poor, their yearly earnings varying from \u00a35 to \u00a38 (Rs. 50-80). They worship goddesses, their guardian divinity being Manai M\u00e1ta. After death the body is set close to a wall and some wheat flour, a pot of water, a bag, and two wooden shoes are placed before it. The caste has no headman, patel. Ods claim to be Kshatris, tracing their descent from Bhagirath\u00ed son of Sagar, after whom the Ganges is called Bh\u00e1girathi. The caste has four branches, Solanki, Bhati, Choh\u00e1n, and Gohil. Most of them are diggers with yearly earnings varying from \u00a310 to \u00a315 (Rs. 100-150). They have no headman.\n\nOf Leather Workers there was one class with a strength of 1237 souls or 0.33 per cent of the whole Hindu population. The Mochis came from Gujarat about 200 years ago, and from their family names D\u00e1bhi, Parm\u00e1r, Choh\u00e1n, Jh\u00e1la, Makv\u00e1na, Chund\u00e1sma, and Solanki seem to have once been Rajputs. Their home language is Gujar\u00e1ti. They are generally rather fair and dress like other Cutchis. They used to drink liquor and eat flesh, but since they adopted the religion of Sv\u00e1min\u00e1r\u00e1yan they have given them up. They are clean, sober, well-behaved, and rather idle. They make shoes in native and European fashion, saddles, water-bags, and bottles. Four houses work as gold and silver carvers, forty as embroiderers on wool and silk, making table cloths, caps, shoes, slippers, and handkerchiefs, and five as arm-polishers and gilders. They do not clean or tan hides. They earn enough for ordinary expenses and as a rule are well-dressed. They belong to the Sv\u00e1min\u00e1r\u00e1yan sect. Their marriage, birth, and death customs do not differ from those of other Hindus. Their family goddesses are \u00c1sh\u00e1pura, Chavan, and Br\u00e1hmani. They have a headman, but disputes are decided at mass meetings. Besides the Mochis, the Meghv\u00e1ls and Turiy\u00e1s clean, tan, and dye leather. The Meghv\u00e1ls\n\n---\n\n1 The tradition is that king Sagar had 7100 sons. He ordered them to dig a well and swore that he would not wash his face until water came. While they were digging, a quantity of earth fell on his sons and all but Bhagirath died. Going to the Ganges to save his brothers the holy river promised to come if he would not look behind him. After a little while, on being told that the Ganges was following him, Bhagirath looked behind, and the Ganges stopped, and ordered him if he wished the salvation of his brothers to begin digging. He, with some Rajputs, became professional diggers and formed a separate caste.\nalso make shoes and are cobblers. The Turiy\u00e1s are Muhammadans, generally earning their living as tanners and leather dyers.\n\nOf Depressed Castes there were four with a strength of 36,306 souls or 9\u00b785 per cent of the whole Hindu population. Of these 35,142 were Meghv\u00e1ls, 837 P\u00e1r\u00e1dhis and 161 Mes, and 166 Bhangi\u00e1s. Meghv\u00e1ls, also found in Sind, the Ganges Provinces, and Central Himalayas, state that in a twelve years' drought in K\u00e1thi\u00e1war they became degraded by carrying and skinning dead cattle. Of nine branches, Bhuchiya, Bhuringya, Dhua, Dhopra, Gora, Kopal, Rhola, Runal, and Rosya, they weave cloth, labour, and carry dead cattle. They worship goddesses. They have no headman, but the farmer of the tax on skinners of dead cattle is acknowledged as their head. Breakers of caste rules are required to give a dinner to their priests, gors. These priests Garud\u00e1s enjoy the revenue and are the puj\u00e1ris of the snake temple at Bhuji\u00e1 fort (see p. 64). On his accession a Garuda puj\u00e1ri marks the new R\u00e1o's brow with saffron and ties a turban on his head. Bhangi\u00e1s, scavengers, are said to be sprung from a certain V\u00e1lam, who about 2000 years ago started the profession of sweeping. There are six branches, Dhori, Makv\u00e1na, Parm\u00e1r, R\u00e1thod, Solanki, and V\u00e1ghela. They worship goddesses, different families having different guardian deities. The P\u00e1r\u00e1dhis and Mes half Hindu, half Musalm\u00e1n, are hunters and weavers of leaf mats. A M\u00e9 eats food cooked by a Musalm\u00e1n but a Musalm\u00e1n will not eat food cooked by a M\u00e9.\n\nDevotees and Religious Beggars of various names, Brahmach\u00e1ris, Sany\u00e1sis, S\u00e1dhus, Vair\u00e1gis, Jog\u00eds, Kh\u00e1khis, Atits or Gos\u00e1\u00eds, K\u00e1pd\u00eds, and K\u00e1nphat\u00e1s, numbered in all 6840 or 1\u00b785 per cent of the whole Hindu population. The sanctity of N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Sarovar and Madh brings many religious beggars to the province. Some of them remain for a considerable time, others, after staying a few days, pass on in their tour of pilgrimage. Of devotees settled in the district the chief are Atits, K\u00e1pd\u00eds, and K\u00e1nphat\u00e1s.\n\nAtits or Gos\u00e1\u00eds, 4877, are in Cutch divided into two classes, celebates, mathdh\u00e1ris, and householders, gharb\u00e1ris. The householders, all of them Shaivs, are the largest class, numbering 3760 souls. They belong to ten sects, Gir, Parvat, S\u00e1gar, Puri, Bh\u00e1rthi, Van, Aran, Sarasvati, Tirth, and \u00c1shram, and add the clan name to the personal name, as Karangar, Hira-puri, Chanchal-bh\u00e1rthi. All of these clans have some of their members householders, gharb\u00e1ris, and others monks, mathdh\u00e1ris, and take recruits from all classes of\n\n---\n\n1 Vivien de St. Martin Geog. Grec. et Latine de l'Inde, 209. The Meghs, probably the Magians of Timur, are a large part of the population of Riy\u00e1si, Jammu and Aknur, a pure race of low caste, apparently outcaste in other places. They are perhaps the Mekei of the Aryans and to them belong the Mekhw\u00e1l (Makv\u00e1na). They claim to be S\u00e1rasvat Br\u00e1hmans. Cunningham, Arch. Rep. II. 13. Burnes (Royal Geog. Soc. IV. 93) speaks of the Megvars of South Thar as an aboriginal or Jat race. They are probably connected with the Mehars of lower Sind and the Megh\u00e1ris of Baluchistan, and are, perhaps, Pliny's (77) Megari or Megallae and the Mokars of the Rajput chronicles. Vivien de St. Martin, 198. Burton (Sind 323) speaks of Sind Megh\u00e1ws as Dheds or Meghv\u00e1ls, tanners, shoemakers and weavers, found in many parts of Sind.

Most of them are professional beggars. But among them some are bankers, merchants, state servants, and soldiers. They do not wear the thread, and allow widow marriage. They are said to have come to Cutch from Junagadh in Kathiawar about three hundred years ago, and, of their three chief settlements, Kalyaneshwar in Bhuj, Ajepal in Anjar, and Koteswar in the west, wrested two, Koteswar and Ajepal, from the Kanphatas.\n\nKapdis.\n\nKa'rdis, 285 strong, are devotees of the temple of Ashapura Mata at Madh, about fifty miles north-west of Bhuj. Of the name Kapdi no satisfactory origin has been traced. They say that they came from Gujarat about 1800 years ago, and had records so late as the great defeat of Jhara (1762) when they deserted their villages and lost their property. All they now know of their history is that Lal Jas Raj was their founder, and that they were patronized by Raja Gaddhesing, the father of Vikramajit (56 B.C.). After this nothing further is heard of them till, in the sixteenth century, Rao Khengarji's father (1500), when in distress, vowed all honour to Ashapura Mata if she helped his cause. On succeeding in his enterprise he went on a pilgrimage to Madh, endowed the temple with several villages, and with the title of Raja gave its guardians the privilege of remaining seated when visited by the Rao. About a hundred and fifty years later (1660) Mekan, a Rajput devotee of Madh, quarrelled with the head of the sect, and withdrawing from it founded a separate sub-division. Since then the original sect has been known as Ashapuris, and the new sect, after their founder's name, as Mekapanthis. Living in buildings round the temple of Ashapura Mata, the Kapdis are ruled by their high priest or Raja. Some years ago the high priest had two specially favoured disciples, Bhagbhar and Govind. While the elder\n\n---\n\n1 Bava Revagir Kuvargir, a leading Cutch banker, is held in great repute throughout Hindustan; and Bava Savaigir was highly trusted by the late Thakor of Bhavnagar. Ind.

The sacred bull, nandi, holds a prominent place on the platform facing the door of the Ajepal shrine, and a tinyam is engraved on the small cells, chhatras, built over the graves of their high priests. Burgess' Arch. Sur. Rep. (1874-75), 210.\n\n3 This account is compiled from Sir A. Burnes' paper of 29th March 1827, in Bom. Gov. Sel. CLIL, Appendix, 17-19; Mr. Money's paper in the Oriental Christian Spectator, VI., Dec. 1835; Mrs. Postans' Cutch, 1837; and Colonel Barton's Tour in Cutch, 1878.\n\n4 Their number seems to have considerably increased during the last fifty years. Sir A. Burnes (1827) gives about 100; Mr. Money (1828), 120 to 130; and Mrs. Postans (1837), 120.\n\n5 The usual explanation is that the name Kapdi comes from their worshipping Parvati as Kala puri or Kaya puri. One story of their origin is that the Almighty, after creating Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra, and Shakti, ordered Rudra to marry Shakti. Rudra refused unless Shakti changed her form. The change was made and Rudra married her, but soon after, at her earnest wish, allowed her to take her old form. The children born, while Shakti was thus transformed, were called Kapdis or children of the fallen body, from kaya body and padi fallen. According to another story Lalu Jas Raj their founder, after the conquest of Ceylon going with Ram to Hinglaj Mata on the borders of Makran, was, as they passed through Madh, left by him to build a temple to Ashapura Mata the wish-fulfilling goddess, and to found the sect of Kapdis.\ndisciple Bh\u00e1gbhara was in Sind, the high priest died. Govind succeeded and on Bh\u00e1gbhara's return refused to acknowledge his claims. Bh\u00e1gbhara appealed to the state, and the R\u00e1ja decided that he should be high priest with the full management of the affairs of the sect, and Govind should be ror\u00e1si or R\u00e1ja elect, living separate and with a small school of disciples, chel\u00e1s. Since then, when a R\u00e1ja dies, the ror\u00e1si succeeds him, and the eldest disciple of the deceased R\u00e1ja becomes ror\u00e1si. If the ror\u00e1si dies before the R\u00e1ja, one of his own disciples is chosen to fill his place. Except the ror\u00e1si and his band of twenty-five disciples who have a separate establishment, the K\u00e1pd\u00eds live and eat together, and as the whole stores are in the R\u00e1ja's hand, the ror\u00e1si and his disciples depending on him for daily supplies, all clashing of authority or risk of schism is avoided. As they may not marry, the K\u00e1pd\u00eds keep up their order by recruiting. Most disciples are Loh\u00e1n\u00e1s, but except from the degraded classes they may be taken from any Hindu caste. To receive a new member the whole body of K\u00e1pd\u00eds meet together. The new brother is brought in, his tuft of hair, m\u00e1t\u00fapa, cut off, and the peculiar cap of the order placed on his head. He is presented to \u00c1sh\u00e1pura, takes the vows, is welcomed by the whole sect, refreshed with opium water, kasumba, and feasted. He has little to learn but the art of begging and some special forms of prayer. They are well-to-do and very hospitable, careful to offer food to travellers of every race and religion, and opium to visitors of rank or wealth. They let out their land, tilling none of it themselves, and leading an idle easy life, begging and looking after their monastery as, in the absence of women, cooking and other details rest with them. They are utterly unlearned, none but the R\u00e1ja being able to read or write. They have some curious rules, one that if the R\u00e1ja leaves Madh he cannot come back till after sunset, another that no K\u00e1pd\u00ed or pilgrim may stay more than the twelve hours of the night at Hingl\u00e1j. If day dawns on him in Hingl\u00e1j his own goddess will drown or otherwise destroy him. Except the R\u00e1ja whom they burn, the K\u00e1pd\u00eds bury their dead. A R\u00e1ja is mourned for twelve days, and then with feasting and merriment the R\u00e1ja elect takes his place.\n\nBhuva's, 678, settled in Madh and tracing their origin to the brother of the founder of the K\u00e1pd\u00eds, differ from them in marrying, wearing beards, and eating with all except the degraded classes. Like the K\u00e1pd\u00eds they lead an idle easy life, fed out of the revenues of the temple of \u00c1sh\u00e1pura.\n\nK\u00e1'np\u00e1t\u00e1s, or slit-ears, 322 in number, have three separate sees, at Dhinodhar in the north-west of Bhuj, at Shivra Mandap in the town of Bhuj, and at Manphara in V\u00e1gad. Of these the most important is Dhinodhar with about fifty members and three branches,\n\n---\n\n1 Mrs. Postans' Cutch, 128.\n2 Mr. Money.

Taking their name from slitting their ears and hanging from the slit a peculiar earring called darshan, they claim as their founder Dhoramn\u00e1th who, according to Cutch story, among other wonders destroyed R\u00e1ipur or old M\u00e1ndvi and dried up the Ran. Formerly the K\u00e1nph\u00e1t\u00e1s were a very powerful body, but as noticed above, about 300 years ago, two of their chief monasteries, at Koteshvar in the west and Ajep\u00e1l in the east, were wrested from them by mendicants, atits, from Jun\u00e1gad.\n\nThe Dhinodhar monks, endowed by more than one of the R\u00e1os, are a rich body living in a large comfortably fortified and fenced monastery on a wooded knoll overlooking a little lake at the foot of Dhinodhar hill, with temples, dwelling houses, and the tombs of their headmen, piirs. Among the buildings Dhoramn\u00e1th\u2019s shrine, a rough domed temple standing on a raised platform and about seven feet square and as many high, contains a marble statue of the saint, three feet high, and wearing the earrings of the sect. Besides Dhoramn\u00e1th\u2019s statue, there are small lings and other brass and stone idols. Here, ever since the time of Dhoramn\u00e1th, a lamp has been kept burning and worship is performed twice a day. In a shed close by is a sacred fire, the flame fed since the time of Dhoramn\u00e1th by blocks of wood.\n\nExcept for their huge horn, agate, or glass earrings, that about seven inches round and 2\u00bd ounces (6 tol\u00e1s) in weight, make their ear-lobes ugly, almost painful to look at, and a necklace of rudraksh beads, the K\u00e1nph\u00e1t\u00e1s wear the ordinary Hindu dress, a coat, and waist cloth generally of a red ochre colour. The head of the monastery is, on succession, invested by the R\u00e1o with a gold-bordered blue silk turban, a sacred woollen neck-thread, shelbi, a scanty waist band, white waist cloth, a red or brick-coloured scarf, sh\u00e1l, and wooden pattens, ch\u00e1khd\u00eds. His ornaments are very old and rich. His earrings, the same in shape as those worn by his disciples, are gilt and inlaid with gems. From his neck hangs a rhinoceros horn whistle, which it is one of his chief privileges to blow when he worships his gods.\n\nTheir ordinary food is millet and pulse. They are rich, and spend most of their yearly income of \u00a31700 (Rs. 17,000), in entertaining strangers of all castes and creeds. To all comers, two meals of millet and pulse are served every day. High caste strangers take it uncooked, low caste strangers are fed in a large hall, and Musalm\u00e1ns and members of the degraded classes in the garden. On some special days, Gokul Atham in August, and Navr\u00e1tra in October, rice and l\u00e1ps\u00ed, that is wheat flour, molasses and butter, are cooked, and opium is distributed.\n\n---\n\n1 Details are given under \u201cM\u00e1ndvi\u201d and \u201cDhinodhar.\u201d\n2 The expenses of their charity are met by the produce of about twenty villages, which are the property of the establishment.

Soc., V. 268.\nWorshippers of Shiv, they have a special ritual for their goddess, the head repeating a hymn in her honour on the second of every month. Their worship is a form of abstraction, yog, the special tenets of their founder having long been forgotten. As they are bound to celibacy the sect is kept up by recruiting. New comers generally belong to one of two classes, orphans or the children of destitute persons who enter as boys, and lazy or disheartened men who are taken in sometimes at an advanced age. The novice starts as the disciple of some member of the sect who becomes his spiritual guide, guru. On joining, his guide gives him a black woollen thread, tied round the neck with a rudra knot, from which hangs a two-inch horn or speaking trumpet, shringin\u00e1d, and through it he is made to repeat the words omk\u00e1r, updesh, \u00e1desh, or the mystic om, teaching, and orders. His conduct is closely watched for eight months. Then, if he has behaved well, he is taken before the god Bhairav and has the cartilage of his ears slit by one of the devotees. In the slit a nimb stick is thrust and the wound cured by a dressing of nimb oil. When the ear is well, large agate, glass, or bone rings are thrust into the slit, the hair, beard and mustachios are shaved, and by the guide, the rule, updesh mantra, of the sect, \u201cBe wise, pious, and useful,\u201d is whispered in the disciple\u2019s ear, and he is called by a new name ending in n\u00e1th. He is now a regular devotee, repeating the name, d\u00e1da, of the founder of the sect, serving his guide, and doing any duty he may be set to. Devotees of this sect are buried, and on the twelfth day after death a feast is given and alms distributed by the eldest disciple who succeeds to his guide\u2019s place. On the death of the head of the monastery the guides choose one of their number to succeed. The position of head is one of much local honour. The R\u00e1o invests him with a dress, pays him a visit, and is received by the holy man seated. The present head, the twenty-seventh in order of succession, was installed in 1879. In former times when any oppression was threatened the K\u00e1nphat\u00e1s, like the Bh\u00e1ts and Ch\u00e1rans used to commit tr\u00e1ga, sacrificing one of their number, so that the guilt of his blood might be on their oppressor\u2019s head.\n\nThe K\u00e1nphata monastery at Shivr\u00e1mandap in Bhuj was established in 1749 by R\u00e1o Desalji, and given to a Jogi of Dhinodhar. This Jogi was soon after replaced by one Sev\u00e1n\u00e1th Shrinagar, in whose line of disciples it still continues. Like the Dhoramn\u00e1th K\u00e1nphat\u00e1s they belong to the sect of Sh\u00e1ntin\u00e1th. They worship the ling, the statue of a brazen horseman, nakalank, the coming tenth incarnation, and female divinities, shaktis.

But the ground was already taken by a devotee called Kanthadn\u00e1th, and at first as his wishes were not consulted, he threw down the walls as soon as they were built. At last he was appeased and the fort finished, and called after him. The devotee's descendants became herdsmen, generally staying at a well at Manphario near Kanthkot. R\u00e1o Bh\u00e1rmalji (1715), once passing, was entertained by Udekanthad the head of the community, and his whole army was fed from one small dish. In return the R\u00e1o established Udekanthad as the head of a monastery and endowed it with the lands near the Manphario. They worship Ganesh and Kanthadn\u00e1th, using Kanthadn\u00e1th's name in telling their beads. Their chief temple is at Kanthkot where twice a day Kanthadn\u00e1th is worshipped. In taking a vow of celibacy and in almost all their customs they resemble the Dhinodhar K\u00e1nphat\u00e1s.\u00b9 They recruit chiefly from \u00c1hirs and Rajputs.\n\nMusalm\u00e1ns, according to the latest (1872) revised figures number 118,700 souls or 24\u00b735 per cent of the whole Cutch population. Found over the whole province they are in greatest strength in Garda, Abd\u00e1sa, and Banni in the west and north-west, less numerous in K\u00e1nthi in the south, and fewest in V\u00e1gad in the east.\n\nCutch Musalm\u00e1ns are partly immigrants, partly local converts. The immigrants from Sind and Gujar\u00e1t are, some of them, of more or less foreign descent, and others purely Hindu. The local Musalm\u00e1n converts are from among Cutch Hindus. With few exceptions their home tongue is Cutchi. Gujar\u00e1ti is spoken by a few, and Urdu by still fewer. Some are landowners, traders especially to Bombay and Africa, and craftsmen, but most are cattle-dealers, soldiers, peasants, and servants. Except the trading classes, chiefly Memans and Khoj\u00e1s, and some Banni and Garda proprietors who are in easy circumstances, Cutch Musalm\u00e1ns are generally much poorer than Cutch Hindus. By faith more are Sunnis than Shi\u00e1s. At their chief family occasions, especially at marriages, most classes perform many Hindu ceremonies. At the beginning of a marriage the women meet in the early morning and sing songs. This is called dhol-chh\u00e1p literally drum-beating. Dates are then handed round, and on all relations' houses gardeners' wives bak\u00e1lans, tie \u00e1s\u00f3pal, Polysfthia longifolia, garlands. Then the bridegroom loaded with ornaments is seated in a bower, chauri, and dates are again handed round. Few of them give their children much schooling or take to new pursuits. As a whole they are neither a rising nor a pushing class.\n\nSyeds, numbering 1819 souls, are found over almost the whole of Cutch. According to tradition they represent different Syeds, who from time to time came from northern India and Sind. Of their history and dates no exact information is available. They have lost the special Syed appearance and differ little from other Cutch Musalm\u00e1ns. Their home language is Cutchi. Generally\n\n\u00b9 Some of them are (1826) allowed to marry. But the fathers will not eat with their children until their ears are slit and other dedicatory rites performed. Burnes MS.\nneat and clean, some are hardworking, fairly honest, sober, and thrifty. Religious teachers, husbandmen, servants, and beggars, they are in middling condition, many of them in debt, but all with some credit. Sunnis in name, some are Shi\u00e1s at heart. Marrying generally among themselves they form a separate and well-managed community. Their sons sometimes marry the daughters of Shaikhs and other foreign or local classes, but their daughters as a rule marry Syeds only. Except that the higher families portion their widowed daughters and do not let them re-marry, all follow Sunni customs. They do not give their children much schooling or take to new pursuits.\n\nShaikhs, numbering 75,549 souls, found in almost all Cutch villages, are said to be the descendants of local Hindu converts. In the north and east, leading a wandering life, they are strong wild-looking men, dark, with high noses, thick lips, long necks, and long streaming locks of hair. Their home tongue in the north is like Sindi, and in the east a rough Gujar\u00e1ti. Though dirty and untidy most are hardworking, honest, and thrifty. They are cattle-dealers in the north, and in the east cultivators, cattle-dealers, and servants. Few want food or clothing and few are rich. Most have some credit and some debts, spending more than their savings on their family ceremonies. All are, at least in name, Sunnis, following religious guides, pirs, to whom some special fees and certain small yearly sums are paid. Early marriage is customary, for girls about five, and for boys about eight years. Marrying only among themselves they form separate communities generally settling their disputes by headmen chosen from themselves. Like Gujar\u00e1t Musalm\u00e1ns, pregnancy ceremonies are performed on the seventh or ninth month after conception, and the same rejoicings as in Gujar\u00e1t mark the birth of the first son. On the sixth day the chhathi ceremony is held and relations feasted. Among the poor cooked food is distributed to relatives, who in exchange send uncooked grain, which is generally given to the midwife. Boys are circumcised in their third or fourth, and sometimes in their seventh, year. Sacrifice, akika, and initiation, bismill\u00e1h, ceremonies are rare. At betrothals and marriages many Hindu customs are observed. They are not a rising class. Very few give their children much schooling or take to new pursuits. A sect of Shaikhs numbering 1327 souls and inhabiting Sumr\u00e1sar, a village about ten miles north of Bhuj, are professional beggars. In dress they differ from other Shaikhs only in wearing turbans of twisted black wool. They go from door to door beating small drums, daj\u00edas. Sunnis by faith they pay special reverence to D\u00e1wal Sh\u00e1h Pir.\u00b9 Their ceremonies do not differ from those of other Shaikhs.\n\n\u00b9 The real name of this saint was Malik Abd-ul-lat\u00edf the son of Muhammad Kuraishi, one of Mahmud Begad\u00e1's nobles (1459-1511), whose title D\u00e1wal-ul-mulk has been changed into D\u00e1wal Sh\u00e1h Pir. In reward for his penances Sh\u00e1h Al\u00e1m Bukh\u00e1ri made him his disciple, and proclaimed him equal in rank to S\u00e1lar Mas'ud Gh\u00e1zi, a famous commander of Mahmud Ghaznav\u00ed's. This pir, given much to religious war, jih\u00e1d, was, in the month of Z\u00edkaad 879 A.H. (1474 A.D.) slain by Deda Rammalji at Amron near Jodia under Nav\u00e1nagar. Many offerings and sacrifices are made to this saint and throughout the whole of Gujar\u00e1t and the Deccan his name is held in reverence by all classes of common people Hindus and Musalm\u00e1ns. His followers observe many Hindu customs, T\u00e1rikh-ul-awliya by Syed Ahmad Gulshan\u00e1b\u00e1d.\nMOGHALS, 391 strong, scattered over different parts of Cutch are settled chiefly in Bhuj. Coming from Ahmedabad, Sind, and the North-West Provinces about 100 years ago, they are said to have at first been Shi\u00e1s, and to have by degrees changed to the popular Cutch faith, and to be now staunch Sunnis. Their home tongue is Hindust\u00e1ni much mixed with Cutchi and Gujar\u00e1ti. Most of them servants, they are generally hardworking, honest, and cleanly. They are fairly well off, with in most cases, a certain amount of credit. They are all followers of the same religious head, pir, and marry generally among themselves. On special occasions, when there is a want of girls in their own class, they associate with Path\u00e1ns. In their customs there is nothing peculiar. They seem content with their position as servants and do not take to any new pursuits or send their children to school.\n\nPATH\u00c1NS, numbering 936 souls, found chiefly in Bhuj, M\u00e1ndvi, and V\u00e1gad, are said to be the descendants of Path\u00e1ns brought from Ahmedabad by R\u00e1o Kheng\u00e1rji in 1534, when, with the help of Sult\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur (1526 - 1536) of Ahmedabad, he established himself as ruler of Cutch. Though by intermarriage they have lost their special size and strength, their long faces and sharp eyes still distinguish them from other Cutchis. Their home tongue is still Hindust\u00e1ni though much mixed with Cutchi and Gujar\u00e1ti. Almost all of them are soldiers, fairly hardworking, well-behaved, cool-tempered, and hospitable. Their condition is middling, all with some credit but many of them in debt and none able to save. Sunnis in faith some are religious, but without any special spiritual head. Marrying generally among themselves they form a separate community. Their customs do not differ from those of other Sunni Musalm\u00e1ns. Among the more respectable families re-marriage is uncommon, widows dressing in white and wearing no ornaments. They give their children very little schooling, and are in no respect a rising class.\n\nMOMNA's, numbering 14,000 souls, are found in greatest numbers in the irrigated country to the north-west, south-east, and south-west of Bhuj, and chiefly in the gir\u00e1sia villages. Descendants of Hindus of various castes, they are, according to one account, said to have been converted to the Musalm\u00e1n faith by Im\u00e1msh\u00e1h, and a portion of them to have, after the great Momna revolt and defeat (1691) in Gujar\u00e1t, fled to Cutch and settled at Shikra in V\u00e1gad. According to another account they were Leva Kanbis converted and called Momn\u00e1s or Momins, believers, by Pir Sadr-ud-din who is said to have become their independent pontiff, im\u00e1m.\u00b9 Slightly made and dark, the Momn\u00e1s shave the head except the top knot, and the face except the upper lip. The men wear coats, trousers, and three-cornered over-hanging turbans. Dark in colour, their women wear petticoats, jackets, and head cloths. Their home tongue is Gujar\u00e1ti\n\n\u00b9 Bom. Gov. Sel. CLII. 47. According to their own account their ancestors the Gujar\u00e1t Leva Kanbis were converted at Pat\u00e1n by a Syed who met them there, and by taking them to the Ganges and bringing them back in a trice, induced them to become Musalm\u00e1ns.\nwithout any noticeable peculiarities. Untidy, but sober, quiet and hardworking, Momnas work chiefly as husbandmen and labourers. Very few are rich or well off, and many are in debt, but as a class they have enough for their daily wants. Shi\u00e1s in faith they are Musalm\u00e1ns in little more than name, their habits, feelings, and general mode of thought being Hindu. The ordinary form of salutation among themselves is the Shravak phrase, Joh\u00e1r joh\u00e1r, and with others the ordinary Hindu form, R\u00e1m, R\u00e1m; although not knowing why, they keep the janm\u00e1shtami and div\u00e1li holidays dressing in their best and feasting. Though according to their own accounts they believe in Shet Syed of P\u00e1tan, the cultivators devote one-twentieth part of their income, and the labourers a rupee a year each to Im\u00e1msh\u00e1h\u2019s shrine at Pir\u00e1na.\u00b9 The rich among them often, and the poor once in their life, go to visit his tomb at Pir\u00e1na. Marrying among themselves they form a separate body with, at M\u00e1nkuva near Bhuj, a headman, patel, who settles all disputes. He has also the power of fining and excommunicating any one who breaks caste rules. His sanction is also necessary for widow marriage, any widow marrying without his consent being excommunicated. Murder and adultery are punished by excommunication, the offender being allowed to rejoin on paying a fine. They do not associate with Musalm\u00e1ns, eat no flesh, do not circumcise, say no five daily prayers, and do not keep the Ramz\u00e1n fast. On the sixth day after birth a red powder, gul\u00e1l, cross is made on the ground by the women of the family and at the end of a month a S\u00e1rasvat Br\u00e1hman names the child.\u00b2 The marriage day is fixed with the consent of both fathers. Four days before the appointed time a booth is built, and a garland hung round the bridegroom\u2019s neck. Women sing songs and dates are distributed. On the marriage day the bridegroom\u2019s father, with his relations and friends, forming a procession, j\u00e1n, leads the bridegroom to the bride\u2019s house where the ceremony is performed first by a Br\u00e1hman and then by a Syed, a descendant of Im\u00e1msh\u00e1h one of whom lives at every Momna settlement. The dying are bathed and a lamp fed with clarified butter is placed before them. God\u2019s name is uttered, and when life has gone the body is tied on a new cot, covered with a cotton cloth, and while the bearers repeat the words S\u00e1hib, S\u00e1hib,\u00b3 is carried to the burial-ground, and buried. As in Gujar\u00e1t, instead of a mosque, a dwelling, kh\u00e1na, with a lamp always burning in it, is set apart, and a seat, g\u00e1di, of Im\u00e1msh\u00e1h kept in it, where the men every evening, and the women occasionally meet and worship. The cultivators set apart a fifth of the gross income of their farms as a gift to the kh\u00e1na. They give their children no schooling and take to no fresh callings.\n\nKhoj\u00e1s, honourable or worshipful converts, numbering 7253 souls, are found all over Cutch, chiefly on the south coast in M\u00e1ndvi,\n\n\u00b9 According to another account they pay their dues to Sadr-ud-din\u2019s seat, masnad, in Gujar\u00e1t. Bom. Gov. Sel. CLII. 47. Besides believing in Im\u00e1msh\u00e1h and Sadr-ud-din they worship B\u00e1bo Velo a murdered robber and outlaw and his wife R\u00e1ngad, a sat\u00ed whose shrine is at Shikra in V\u00e1gad.\n\u00b2 Some of these Br\u00e1hmans believe in Muhammadan precepts.\n\u00b3 This is an invocation to their Lord and Master, the light that burns in their temple, to save the dead man\u2019s soul from hell.\nMundra, and Anj\u00e1r, and have an old and large settlement in Bhuj. Some of them claim Persian descent and say that they fled from Persia when their power was overthrown by Hal\u00e1ku the T\u00e1rt\u00e1r (1255). But most are probably of Hindu origin, some Sindis, others Cutchis, converted to the Khoja faith 400 years ago by Pir Sadr-ud-din. According to one account a detachment of them came from Sind about 1550 under the guidance of a certain Pir D\u00e1du. Of middle size, strongly made and of fair complexion, they wear the beard short and the moustache long. They dress like other Cutchis and at home speak Cutchi without any marked peculiarity. They are well off, in no way scrimped for food or clothes. Many are able to meet special expenses, but some are forced to borrow. Thrifty and hardworking they are quiet and orderly. Most of them are traders, but if they seem likely to gain by it they are ready to take up any new calling. Several of them of late, prospering in trade, have, near Bhuj, sunk wells and built rest-houses. Shi\u00e1s of the Naz\u00e1ri\u00e1n Ism\u00e1\u00edli sect, they follow His Highness \u00c1gha Kh\u00e1n whom they worship and obey as their unrevealed im\u00e1m and hereditary chief, descended in direct line from Ism\u00e1\u00edl the son of J\u00e1far S\u00e1d\u00edk, the last of the revealed im\u00e1ms, and from the \u2018Old Man of the Mountain,\u2019 Shaikh-al-jabal, otherwise known as Hasan-i-Sabb\u00e1h the originator of their faith and converter of their ancestors the terrible Assassins of Alamut. Their converter Pir Sadr-ud-din, a missionary, d\u00e1i, of one of His Highness \u00c1gha Kh\u00e1n\u2019s ancestors, is said to have introduced a religious book of ten incarnations, dasavat\u00e1r, containing the nine incarnations of Vishnu and the incarnation of the most holy Ali as the tenth.\u00b9 They have no mosques, but say their prayers, which consist of hearing the tenth chapter of the dasavat\u00e1r and reciting the pedigree of His Highness \u00c1gha Kh\u00e1n, in their assembly houses, jam\u00e1t kh\u00e1n\u00e1s. Sadr-ud-din, dying at Uchh in the Panj\u00e1b, some of his descendants settled at Kadi in the Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r\u2019s territory, and were named Kadiw\u00e1ls. One of the Kadiw\u00e1ls, Ghul\u00e1m Ali Sh\u00e1h by name, came in 1792 to Kera in Cutch and being received by the Khoj\u00e9s with much honour settled there.\u00b2 At his shrine a yearly fair is held in August (Chaitra Sud 11). Marrying among themselves, the Khoj\u00e9s form a distinct community whose caste disputes are settled by mass meetings. They have a treasurer or steward, muhshi, and an accountant, kum\u00e1ria, whose duty it is to collect and forward for transmission to His Highness \u00c1gha Kh\u00e1n, as im\u00e1m, wherever he may chance to reside, the contributions raised on his account by the community. They have lately shewn themselves anxious to give their children\n\n\u00b9 The reason of the Khoja religion being so much like the Hindu, and of the writing of this treatise of dasavat\u00e1r, is explained by the fact that the Shia missionaries, d\u00e1s\u00eds, were always instructed to assume or admit the truth of the greater portion of the religious tenets of those whom they wished to convert. Hence the above treatise, intended to convert to the Ism\u00e1\u00edli faith a body of not very learned Hindus, assumes the nine incarnations of Vishnu to be true as far as they go, and supplements the imperfect Vishnavite system by superadding the cardinal doctrine of the Ism\u00e1illis, the incarnation, avat\u00e1r, of the most holy Ali. Sir H. B. E. Frere, MacMillan\u2019s Magazine, XXXIV. 346 and 434.\n\n\u00b2 Details are given under the head \u201cKera.\u201d\nmore schooling than formerly, and are on the whole a prosperous and rising class.\n\nSamm\u00e1s, numbering 7000 souls, are found in the east and west of the province. With the bulk of their tribe they were probably converted to Isl\u00e1m in Sind about the close of the fourteenth century and are among the late settlers in Cutch. Of more than average height and strength they are dark with flat noses and faces, long necks, thick lank hair, and long beards. They speak a mixture of Cutchi and Sindi. Careless and untidy, they are brave, hardworking, honest, hospitable, and though hot-tempered generally well-behaved. Cultivators, cattle-breeders and dealers, they are as regards food and clothing well off, but most of them have to borrow to meet the expense of their leading family ceremonies. Sunnis in faith the Samm\u00e1s of the west keep their Hindu bards and have also spiritual guides, pirs. Those in the east honour the ordinary maulvis. Generally marrying among themselves their sons sometimes take wives from among the Musalm\u00e1n tribes of Noti\u00e1rs, Hingol\u00e1s, and Abd\u00e1s, and from Sodha Rajputs. They never give their daughters to any but Samm\u00e1s. Disputes are very rare and are settled by their headman the J\u00e1m, who lives at Kun\u00e1ria. They keep to their old Rajput names and at public dinners eat from separate pots. But their birth, marriage, and death customs do not differ much from those of other Musalm\u00e1ns. They give their children no schooling and show no signs of improving their position.\n\nMemans, numbering 6178 souls, are partly immigrants from Sind, partly Cutch converts chiefly Loh\u00e1n\u00e1s by caste. The Sind Memans are said to be Loh\u00e1n\u00e1s converted in 1433 (838 H.) and named believers, momin, by the celebrated saint Syed Yusuf-ud-din the descendant of Syed \u00c1bd-ul-k\u00e1dir Jil\u00e1n\u00ed, the saint of saints, Pir\u00e1npir of Baghd\u00e1d. The story of their conversion is that Sundarji and Hansraj two men of the Loh\u00e1na caste, lived at Nagar Tatta then the capital of Sind governed by Markabkh\u00e1n a ruler tributary to the Ghazni kings. Seeing some miracles performed by the saint, who is said to have come there in 1422, they became Musalm\u00e1ns (1433) and were by him named \u00c1damji and Taj Muhammed. Their example was followed by about 700 Loh\u00e1na families, Sundarji or \u00c1damji being (1541) made their head, sheth. Under his grandson Kato, they, at the invitation of R\u00e1v Kheng\u00e1rji, emigrated to Cutch where their numbers were increased by converts from among the Cutch Loh\u00e1n\u00e1s. They shave their heads, wear long beards, and speak Cutchi without any peculiarities. Neither very neat nor cleanly, they are hardworking, honest, sober, and quiet. Memans follow all professions, those living in villages being cultivators. Their state is middling, with enough for food and clothes, but pressed to meet special demands. Sunnis in faith they are religious and follow the regular K\u00e1zi. In their marriage and other ceremonies they do not differ from other Sunnis. They form a distinct community, settling their caste disputes by a committee of five. Though giving their children little schooling they are a pushing, rising class, ready to take to any new calling and going to distant countries to make their fortunes. Many Cutch Memans, prospering as traders in Kurrachee, Bombay, the Malab\u00e1r coast, Haidarabad, Madras, Calcutta, and Zanzib\u00e1r, have in their native villages built\nChapter III.\n\nPopulation.\n\nMusalm\u00e1ns.\n\nMemans.\n\nmosques, rest-houses, caste-houses, jam\u00e1t kh\u00e1n\u00e1s, wells and ponds, and set apart funds for the charitable distribution of grain. They dress like other Cutch Musalm\u00e1ns and, except that at public feasts they use sweetmeats instead of mutton, there is nothing special in their food. They perform the sacrifice, akika, but seldom the initiation, bismill\u00e1h, ceremony. They have a special spiritual guide, pir, living in Bhuj, who goes by the name of Bhid Valo Pir, his own name being Muhammad Shah, to whom fixed yearly payments are made. They are also in the habit of becoming disciples, murids, of maulvis whom they pay certain yearly fees.\n\nKhatriis.\n\nThe few Musalm\u00e1n Khatri families found in different parts of Cutch, are said to have come from Sind about the middle of the sixteenth century (1544), and to have adopted Isl\u00e1m because of some dispute with their priests, Br\u00e1hmans of the Sar\u00e1svat caste. The men shave the head and wear the beard, and to look at do not differ from other Cutchi Musalm\u00e1ns. They wear the common Cutchi dress and their women dress like the Meman women. They are fair with flat faces, long ears, and high prominent foreheads. They speak Cutchi with no noticeable peculiarities. Generally neat, they are hardworking, honest, sober, thrifty, and orderly. They work as dyers, carpenters, turners, and cultivators, and their women are skilled in embroidery and frilling. As a class they are well-to-do, able to meet all expenses and to save. Sunnis in faith they are religious following the ordinary Sunni maulvis. Marrying among themselves they form a distinct community, settling disputes by persons chosen for the purpose. Hindu Khatriis wishing to join their class are sometimes admitted. Their customs do not differ from those of other Sunnis. Though well-to-do they are not a rising class, giving their children no teaching and taking to no new pursuits.\n\nKumbh\u00e1rs.\n\nKumbh\u00e1rs, numbering 6000 souls, are found in almost all Cutch villages. They are said to have come from Sind about the middle of the sixteenth century. Probably converts from the Hindu caste of the same name, they claim descent from Halimah, the Prophet\u2019s nurse. Both men and women are well-made and have good features. Their home tongue is Cutchi. Hardworking, but seldom neat, they are honest, a few of them thrifty, mild-tempered, and, according to their means, hospitable. Potters and ass-breeders they are in middling condition not stinted for food or clothes, some of them indebted, but almost all with credit. Sunnis in faith, besides a special pir, they honour Sunni maulvis. Forming, as regards marriage, a distinct community, disputes are settled by an officer chosen by themselves, and named prince, mehtar. In their food, dress, and customs, they\n\n---\n\n1 They have another saint Syed Buzurg Ali, the lineal descendant of their first convert Syed Yusuf-ud-din to whom, though they honour him more than the other guide, they made no payments. Being in a very poor state, the friends of this pir lately (1873) published a book, called the Ibr\u00e1z-ul-Hak, containing the history of the Meman conversion, the pedigree of the pir, and a copy of a document passed to Syed Yusuf-ud-din by the Memans, binding themselves and their descendants, to maintain, even if in doing so they were to be sold as slaves, the pir and his descendants. Since this book was published the Memans have begun to fulfil the promise made by their forefathers.\ndo not differ from other Cutch Sunnis. They never teach their children, and though not a rising are a steady class.\n\nSangh\u00e1rs, numbering 4000 souls, both Hindus and Musalm\u00e1ns, are found chiefly along the central part of the north shore of the gulf of Cutch. According to some accounts they came before, according to others they came with the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s from Sind (about 1300). Some years after their arrival they are said to have been converted to Isl\u00e1m by Minchu one of their number who lived at Jakh\u00e1o. Those in the west are more civilised than the rest. They speak Cutchi with a rather harsh Sindi accent. Dirty, and not overhonest, they are hardworking, hot-tempered, and hospitable. Most of them are cattle-breeders, husbandmen, and servants. As a class they are poor, able to meet ordinary charges, but forced to borrow for special expenses. The Sangh\u00e1rs of V\u00e1gad and Abd\u00e1sa are Sunnis. Those of the south and other parts believe in maulvis and have spiritual guides, p\u00edrs, but most of them worship jakhs or white horsemen.\u00b9 They used to intermarry with Rajputs, but now marrying only among themselves they form a distinct community. Their disputes are generally settled by persons appointed by the caste. Their children have Hindu names, and about a fourth of them do not circumcise. The sacrifice, akika, ceremony is unknown and early marriages are common, the ceremony being performed both according to the Musalm\u00e1n and the Hindu rites. Except that they bury their dead, some of them first touching their feet with fire, none of their funeral customs are Musalm\u00e1n. They are not a rising class, neither teaching their children nor taking to new pursuits.\n\nThese Sangh\u00e1rs, though as Musalm\u00e1ns they claim Arab descent, would seem to be of Hindu origin. They are said to include members of several Rajput tribes and to have once formed four distinct castes with many sub-divisions of which their seventy-two family names, nukhs, is a trace.\u00b2 The name is thought to come from sangh a troop or band, and to mean herdsmen. But they are probably the same as the Sang\u00e1r Rajputs who appear in two of Tod\u2019s tables, and are still powerful in part of the North-West Provinces.\u00b3 This tribe would seem to be the same as the Sang\u00e1d\u00e1s or Sang\u00e1ras found by Nearchus (325 B.C.) to the west of the Indus, and by the other detachment of Alexander\u2019s troops between the east and west mouths of that river, and, since then, under the names\n\n\u00b9 Their place of worship is on the K\u00e1kadbet hill eighteen miles west of Bhuj, where on the second Monday of Bh\u00e1ddarva (September), a yearly fair, attended by Sangh\u00e1rs, Hindus, and a few Musalm\u00e1ns, is held. The jakhs or white horsemen are seventy-two in number. Wherever the Sangh\u00e1rs live they have their places of worship with a set of images inside.\n\n\u00b2 Ind. Ant.

Their sole chiefship is Jagmohanpur on the Jamna.\u2019 Sang\u00e1rs are a ruling tribe in Etawah about eighty miles south-east of Agra. The local story is, that, originally belonging to Kanauj, they passed to the south, some say to Ceylon, and, after many wanderings, regained their power in the north-west on the fall of the R\u00e1thods of Kanauj (1194).

In 1690, Ovington describes them as living between Sind and cape Jagat, infesting all the western coast and cruising to Ormaz.\\(^8\\) Their boats were so fast that they were seldom taken. Though pirates they were faithful to their promises. In 1720 Hamilton\\(^9\\) says, Sang\u00e1n\u00eda is their province, Bet their seaport, and a queen their governor. All are pirates, recruited from criminals and villains. Before boarding a ship they drink bhang, and when they wear their long hair loose, they give no quarter. In 1788 Rennell\\(^10\\) describes them, as, from their chief ports of Bet and Aramra, cruising as far as the Persian Gulf.\\(^11\\) With the Sang\u00e1rs\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See Jour. R. A.

In the time of the Baghd\u00e1d Khaliphs they infested the Tigris and occasionally made raids as far up the Red Sea as Jidda. Though Alexander\u2019s writers make no mention of their piracies they are said in earlier times to have been so troublesome as to have forced the Persian kings to block the Euphrates mouth. (Vincent; I. 506). And, in the sixth century (560 A.D.), it was their outrages that made Khosru Navshirw\u00e1n of Persia hasten the transfer to him of the Beluchist\u00e1n coast.

In 1680 Mr. Petit, high in the English Company\u2019s service at Surat, on a voyage to the gulf of Persia, was seized by the Sanganians. They refused\nwere associated other tribes of pirates. Of these the chief were the V\u00e1ghers of Dw\u00e1rka and the V\u00e1dhels of Aramra. At the close of the eighteenth century (1799) they were once or twice attacked by British ships of war, but though the pirate fleets were destroyed their castles were not taken. Later on they were (1809) for a time reduced to order by Colonel Walker. But they again broke out as pirates. In 1816 Dw\u00e1rka and Bet surrendered to a British detachment. Afterwards, when Okh\u00e1mandal was made over to the Gaikwar, V\u00e1ghers rose on the garrison, and were not finally suppressed till, in 1820 (Nov. 26), a British force took and destroyed Dwarka and Bet.\n\nJats, 3000 strong, are found all over Cutch but chiefly in Garda and Banni to the north of Bhuj. They are all Musalm\u00e1ns, converts from the great tribe of Jats or J\u00e1ts, who form the bulk of the low class population in the Panj\u00e1b and Sind. They would seem to have come to Cutch from Sind probably with or after the Samm\u00e1s (1300). But of their arrival nothing certain has been traced. Cattle-dealers by trade, most of the Jats have no fixed abodes and keep moving in search of forage. The men are tall and stout, with regular features, fair complexion, high noses, thin lips, rounded cheeks, lank black hair, and thick full beards, worn sometimes long, sometimes short. The women are stout and handsome. Their home tongue is Cutchi, much mixed with Sindi, on account of their frequent dealings with the Sar\u00e1is of Sind. Besides cattle-dealing, a few are traders, husbandmen, and servants. As a class they are well-to-do, not scrimped for food or clothes, and able to save. In religion they are Sunnis with a separate spiritual head, pir. They also pay reverence to\n\nChapter III.\nPopulation.\nMusalm\u00e1ns.\nSangh\u00e1rs.\n\nJats.\n\nto let him go without a ransom of Rs. 50,000, and Mr. Petit died a prisoner. In 1686, a small Sanganian ship with eight guns, manned by a furious crew of 300 men, cruising between Surat and Bombay, attacked the English man-of-war Phoenix of forty-two guns. Finding their mistake they tried to get away. Pursued by the boats, and scorning quarter, their ship had to be sunk, and only seventy of them were saved. About 1690, Captain Edward Say was, near Bombay, overtaken by two Sanganian boats, one with 150 men and ten guns, the other with four guns and fifty men. Coming up with Say's ship, about seventy or eighty men, armed with swords and targets, scrambled on board. Say's crew, who were all Arabs, leapt into the sea, leaving the captain and two servants to their fate. Rushing at the captain, the pirates nearly cut off his hands, and overpowering him, stripped him naked. Then as there was no resistance they used him well, looked after his wounds, and refreshed him with opium and water. They then made for Aramra in Kathi\u00e1war. Landing there, they brought the captain before their queen. She asked which of her men had taken the treasure. Say refused to tell, and was kept prisoner for a few days. Then, swearing on an image of the Virgin lately robbed out of a Portuguese ship, that he did not know how they had shared the spoil, he was let go. (Ovington's Voyage, 438-446, 163). In 1717, two squadrons of four large and four small vessels with about 3000 men, waylaid the English ship Morning Star on her way to Surat with a rich cargo. Their largest ship, a vessel of 500 tons, opened the engagement, but was compelled to sheer off. Next day they boarded the English vessel from five points and fighting desperately were not shaken off without a loss to the English of seven men killed and seven wounded (Low's Indian Navy, I. 101). In 1797, Lieutenant Hayes, while crossing the entrance of the gulf of Cutch, was attacked by four Sanganian ships, each more than double the size of, and carrying twice as many men as, his vessel. After a fierce attack lasting for three hours they were driven off. (Low's Indian Navy, I. 202-3).\n\n1 Asi\u00e1t. Ann. Reg. (1803), 183. Indian Reg.

In Tod's opinion the name Sanganian did not come from the leading tribe of pirates, but from their practice of lying at the mouths of rivers, sangam. Ditto, 442.\nthe tomb of a Jat woman, M\u00e1ta Bh\u00e1mbhi, about seven miles west of Bhuj, where, at a fair held every year, they meet to pay vows made on behalf of their children. This tomb is respected by other Sunnis. The ashes of the incense burnt at the shrine, if eaten and applied to the wound, are said to cure hydrophobia. In marriage and other respects they form a distinct community and settle their own disputes. They keep to most of their forefathers' customs eating more milk, curds, and clarified butter, than grain. They wear two sheets, ch\u00e1dars, one on the upper and the other on the lower part of the body, and on their heads they tie a scarf, f\u00e1lia. To avoid the expense of washing, the sheets and scarf are coloured a dark yellow. Unlike the other women of Cutch, Jat women wear a gown, gh\u00e1ghr\u00fa, and a head scarf, odni. They never wear bodices. They have also a peculiar ornament, a thick flat silver necklace called h\u00e1ns. Except a little of the Kur\u00e1n and some other religious books they teach their children nothing, and are in no way a pushing or a rising class.\n\nM\u00eda'na's, numbering 3000 souls, are spread over the whole province. They are said to be formed of Musalm\u00e1n families converted from different castes from Sind, H\u00e1l\u00e1r, and K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. Of late years they are said to have received recruits from several of the warlike classes of Cutch Hindus. More active and hardworking than other Musalm\u00e1ns, they are tall and strong, rather ruddy, with regular features, round cheeks, and thick curling beards. Their home tongue is Cutchi. They are dirty in their habits, hardworking, hot-tempered, and though less so than formerly, unruly. Soldiers, sailors', and husbandmen, many of them are still highway robbers. Without thrift, and with little credit, most of them are poor and in debt. Sunnis in faith they have a special spiritual guide, p\u00edr, honouring at the same time different Sunni maulvis. They generally marry among themselves. Except that they bury their dead, their customs are Hindu rather than Musalm\u00e1n. The men wear tight and short clothes and the women, who have no character for chastity or modesty, instead of a gown, gh\u00e1ghr\u00fa, wear only a waist-cloth, pernu or dhebado. Formerly the terror of the country, they have of late years settled to a much quieter and more orderly life, though they still show no signs of trying to improve their position, or any wish to have their children taught.\n\nBoh\u00f3r\u00e1s of the D\u00e1\u00fadi sect, numbering 1947 souls, are found chiefly in Bhuj, M\u00e1ndvi, and Anj\u00e1r. They are said to have come from Gujar\u00e1t and K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r about 300 years ago. Of medium height, lean, and wheat coloured, with very little hair on their faces, they differ much from other Cutch Musalm\u00e1ns. Their language is Gujar\u00e1ti with the same peculiarities as among the Surat D\u00e1\u00fadi Boh\u00f3r\u00e1s. Neat, tidy, and hardworking, the Boh\u00f3r\u00e1s are sober, skilful, quiet, and orderly. Except a few who hold land tilled by others, all are traders chiefly occupied in making and selling alum, saltpetre, and soap, in weaving, and in dealing in iron, timber, oil, dyes, and ink. Shi\u00e1s of the sect of Must\u00e1li-Isma\u00edlis they are followers of the Mulla of Surat to whom, besides one-fifth of their income, khums, they make fixed yearly payments. Regarding marriage and other ceremonies they form a distinct community. Small caste squabbles are settled by persons specially appointed by the Mulla.\nwho himself decides any serious disputes. They dress like Gujar\u00e1t D\u00e1\u00fadi Bohor\u00e1s, in white, rather high and well-folded turbans, waistcoats, and coats, jul\u00e1d\u00ed, loose trousers, tamm\u00e1ns, and, over their shoulders, shawls instead of cotton shoulder cloths. Their women do not wear the ivory bracelets or the red scarf, odni, common in Cutch, nor do they use the veil cloak, burka, common in Gujar\u00e1t. The Bohor\u00e1s wear the beard long and the moustache close cut. They mix much with Sunnis and at least outwardly differ little from them in their customs.\n\nBhad\u00e1'la's, numbering 1000 souls, are chiefly found in M\u00e1ndvi. Their tribe is made up of families of several castes who seem at different times to have come from Sind, H\u00e1l\u00e1r, and Gujar\u00e1t. According to tradition some were Musalm\u00e1ns before they came and others were converted after their arrival in Cutch. They are strong and dark, much like other Sunni Musalm\u00e1ns in feature. Their home tongue is a somewhat peculiar form of Cutchi. They live in houses built of unburnt brick, very neatly covered by their women with white clay. They are almost all sailors most of them engaged in the coasting trade, but many of them ready for a voyage to Aden and Zanzibar, and some of them captains of great skill and courage, acquainted with the use of the compass and quadrant. Some are also fishermen. Their women sell fish and make coir ropes and palm-fans. They are in middling condition, well fed, and well clothed, but rather pressed to meet their special expenses. Sunnis in faith they are religious and pay special reverence to Pir Mur\u00e1d Sh\u00e1h their spiritual guide, to whom, on the return from a voyage, every crew makes certain payments. Vows to the water angel, dary\u00e1pir, are also common. Marrying only among themselves they form a distinct community whose disputes are settled by a committee chosen by the caste. Though some of their women still wear the Hindu dress they are said of late years to keep much more carefully to Musalm\u00e1n customs, those belonging to well-to-do families never appearing in public. They do not teach their children or enter on any fresh pursuits, and on the whole are said to be falling off in numbers and condition.\n\nSumda's, numbering 500 souls, are found chiefly in Bhuj and M\u00e1ndvi. They are the descendants of the Hindu tribe who ruled in Sind from 1032 to 1351. According to their own story, their ancestors fled into Cutch, at the close of the thirteenth century, to escape from the arms of Ala-ud-din Khilji. On settling in Cutch they are said to have remained Hindus, till their headman and 1500 followers, crossing the Ran to the east of Lakhpat, fell short of water, and were suffering the pangs of extreme thirst when the Musalm\u00e1n saint Baha-ud-din appeared and quenched their thirst from a single water-pot. On his\n\n---\n\n1 The principal peculiarities are the use of the word ve, for pan, but; bhalo, for ha, yes.

His tomb, where a yearly fair is held, is still to be seen at Vads\u00e1ra. Dirty, hardworking, honest, and well-behaved, they are soldiers, sailors, grass and wood cutters, and cultivators. Their state is middling, not scrimped for food, but poorly clad and on special occasions forced to borrow. Sunnis in faith they are not religious. They have a spiritual guide, *pir*, whose ancestor is said to have come with them from Sind. Marrying generally among themselves, but occasionally giving their daughters to Syeds, they form a distinct community settling disputes at mass meetings. In their dress and customs they do not differ from other Musalm\u00e1ns. They do not teach their children and are in no way a pushing or rising class.\n\nKers, numbering only a few families scattered over the province, are said to have been Rajputs, the descendants of Man\u00e1i who, about the beginning of the thirteenth century, came from Nagar Samai in Sind, and settled at P\u00e1tghad, now Artdo, governed at first by Man\u00e1i\u2019s uncle and afterwards by Man\u00e1i himself. Man\u00e1i, who had a strong leaning to the Musalm\u00e1n faith, is said to have been converted, along with many Rajputs of different clans. The Kers speak a mixed Cutchi and Sindi dialect. Generally neat and clean, they are idle, honest, thrifty, hot-tempered, hospitable, and well-behaved. Cultivators and cattle-breeders, they are well-to-do, having enough for food and clothes, and able to save. Although with good credit they seldom borrow. None are in debt or beg. Sunnis by faith they are religious and honour maul\u00e9vis. They give their daughters in marriage to the descendants of *pir* Baha-ud-din a Musalm\u00e1n saint. Their chiefs, *tilats*, occasionally marry J\u00e1dej\u00e1s\u2019 daughters. Caste disputes are settled by their J\u00e1m. They circumcise their sons but give their children Hindu names. At their betrothals, marriages, and deaths, they have many Hindu rites, and their women always dress like Rajputs. Their numbers are said to be falling off.\n\nP\u00e1rsis, 40 strong, found in Bhuj, came to Cutch with the British (1816) and settled at Anj\u00e1r then under British management, where there still is a house known as the P\u00e1rsi v\u00e1da. Three of the P\u00e1rsis, including the R\u00e1o\u2019s physician, are state servants, one belongs to the Agency, and the rest are merchants. Except one or two well-to-do families the state of the Cutch P\u00e1rsis is middling.\n\nChristians, 13 strong, found in Bhuj, are for the most part British officers. One is the head master of the arts school, and one, a German, is a contractor.\n\nVillages.\n\nIn the province of Cutch there is one village or town to about every six square miles, each village containing on an average 475 inhabitants and about 163 houses. With the exception of the people of six towns, numbering 91,085 souls or 18\u00b769 per cent of the entire inhabitants, the population of Cutch, according to the 1872 census returns, lived in 1019 villages, with an average of 388 souls to each village.\n\n---\n\n1 *Ker*, in the sense of sinners, was applied to the descendants of Man\u00e1i when they took the land that had been set apart to atone for the murder of Man\u00e1i\u2019s uncle.\nCutch villages are, as a rule, small and fenced by thorn hedges with one or two openings facing the east. The gates, made of thorns and moving on wooden hinges, are during harvest time closed at night. Some villages have high round watch-towers, koth\u00e1s, generally out of repair. Outside the gate is a Hanum\u00e1n, a large shapeless stone, a Mah\u00e1dev's, and sometimes a Shitl\u00e1devi's, temple, and a pond generally dry in the hot season, except a hole dug in its bed. To meet the cost of repairs, some ponds and wells have lands and Acacia arabica, b\u00e1b\u00fal, groves attached. At the entrance gate are the houses of the Meghv\u00e1l, the K\u00e1thodia, the Pinj\u00e1ra, the Kumbh\u00e1r, and other low caste non-cultivating classes. Then follow, in the case of large villages, the houses of the barber, the tailor, the carpenter, the blacksmith, and the cultivators. In the centre are the houses of the village shopkeeper, the Br\u00e1hman, the devotee, atit or gorji in Jain villages, a temple generally dedicated to R\u00e1m or Krishna, and sometimes a Musalm\u00e1n mosque. The houses, built of stone and mud, have, except in the Kora sub-division and in Pachham and a few other places on the Ran, tiled roofs. Near the gate is a large fold, v\u00e1da, for sheep and goats, of which every village has one or two flocks. Fodder and cattle are kept in separate enclosures, where a member of the family usually sleeps.\n\nThere was, in 1872, a total of 167,378 houses, or, on an average, 25\u00b775 houses to the square mile. Of the total number, 37,785 houses lodging 99,790 persons or 20\u00b747 per cent of the entire population, at the rate of 2\u00b764 souls to each house, were buildings with walls of fire-baked bricks and roofs of tile. The remaining 129,593 houses, accommodating 387,515 persons or 79\u00b752 per cent with a population per house of 2\u00b799 souls, included all buildings covered with thatch or leaves or whose outer walls were of mud or sun-dried brick.\n\nThe chief village officers paid by the state or the people, are the headman, patel, the accountant, tal\u00fati, the messenger, hav\u00e1ld\u00e1r and pantya, the craftsmen, vasv\u00e1y\u00e1s, the tracker, pagi, the guard, pas\u00e1\u00edt\u00e1s or k\u00e1thodi\u00e1s, the strolling players, bhav\u00e1y\u00e1s, the revenue officers, dhrus, and the headman's assistant, chaudhri. Most headmen enjoy land paying only a quit-rent, and, though not hereditary, the office is often handed down from father to son. On festive occasions, the headman holds a place of honour amongst the villagers and is with his family asked by them to dinner parties, or presented with uncooked\n\n---\n\n1 In 1821 every village was fortified some of them presenting most formidable and almost insurmountable obstacles to troops unprovided with guns. They are described as all built of stone except those at Lakkpat and M\u00e1ndvi, square or oblong, with four, six, or eight towers, generally well built, but none surrounded by ditches. They were supplied with water generally from wells. The R\u00e1o's forts were garrisoned by Arabs and the chief's forts by their subjects. The space was generally filled with tiled houses inhabited by J\u00e1dej\u00e1s. They were furnished with guns of small calibre, with bad carriages, and in poor repair. Sir A. Burnes' MS. 1828. The 1819 earthquake threw down almost every fortification in Cutch. In 1828 there was scarcely a tenable fort in the province. Ham.

Either Bh\u00e1ti\u00e1s, Loh\u00e1n\u00e1s, V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, Khoj\u00e1s, or Memans by caste, the tal\u00e1t\u00eds are farmers of the petty dues that are levied in every village. They sometimes, but not more than other educated villagers, help the headman to prepare the village accounts. Guards, hav\u00e1l\u00edd\u00e1s, have only lately begun to be paid in cash. In proprietary, gir\u00e1sia, villages they are still paid in grain, and in some places during harvest time they get bread from the cultivators in turn. Musalm\u00e1n or low class Hindu messengers, ponty\u00e1s, are found in every village, and are paid by the villagers in grain worth about 10s. (Rs. 5) a month. They serve as messengers and see to the wants of official travellers. Craftsmen, vasv\u00e1y\u00e1s, literally settlers, including barbers, carpenters, potters, and others, are paid in grain or uncrushed corn heads for ordinary, and in cash for special work. In some old villages they enjoy rent-free lands. Trackers, pag\u00eds, employed only in large villages, are more under the orders of the village landlord than of the villagers. Generally paid in grain and sometimes in cash, their income amounts to about 16s. (Rs. 8) a month. They are not bound to make good to the villagers their losses by theft, but when a theft has been traced to a village its Kol\u00eds and K\u00e1thodi\u00e1s as the least trustworthy classes are held responsible. In gir\u00e1sia villages, except when the person whose property has been stolen is his tenant, the proprietor makes up the loss. Guards, pas\u00e1d\u00ed\u00f3s, found in some villages especially in V\u00e1gad enjoy rent-free lands. K\u00e1thodi\u00e1s, always carrying arms, trace robberies, and in return are allowed some abatement in ordinary village payments and land tax. Bhar\u00e1v\u00e1y\u00e1s, strolling players, come from Gujar\u00e1t in the dry season and receive some customary payments from the cultivators. Dhrus, said to take their names from the polar star, are stationary revenue officers, with the charge of from three to four villages. The headman\u2019s assistant, chaudhri, gets no pay, but is occasionally asked to dinner by the villagers. The common village fund is called the gate, jh\u00e1mpa, fund. Except K\u00e1thodi\u00e1s all villagers contribute to it, cultivators paying twice as much as the rest. Charities, public institutions, except those of the Jains and Musalm\u00e1ns, and expenses connected with the visits of official travellers are paid from this fund. Besides on death and marriage occasions the villagers meet twice a year, on Gokal A\u2019tham in the village temple, and on new year\u2019s day at the house of the biggest man, who, if the proprietor, gir\u00e1sia, or the state agent, mehta, gets presents of coconuts from the villagers. At funerals, except in the case of the lower castes, a man from each family goes with the party to the burning ground. At marriages the villagers meet in the marriage hall, mandvo, and get presents of dates.\n\nMovements of the people.\n\nFrom the uncertainty of the rainfall and from the pushing, vigorous character of the people, there is much more migration in Cutch than in most parts of the Bombay Presidency. The higher class of traders, among Hindus, Bh\u00e1ti\u00e1s, Osv\u00e1l V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, and Loh\u00e1n\u00e1s, and among Musalm\u00e1ns, Khoj\u00e1s, Memans, and Bohor\u00e1s, are always ready to leave their homes in search of employment. Many of them have permanently settled in Bombay. And among the young men, a very large number, both of Hindus and Musalm\u00e1ns, leaving\ntheir families in Cutch go to push their fortunes not only in Bombay and other parts of India, but in Persia, Arabia, Africa, and China. Many of them amass considerable fortunes and return to spend their gains in jewelry, feasts, house and temple building, and the purchase of land. Besides traders a few high class Hindus leave Cutch in search of employment as clerks or in Government service. Like the traders, many of the leading artisans, masons, blacksmiths, coppersmiths, and weavers find work out of Cutch, and in years of scarcity large numbers of the poor are often for the time forced to leave their homes and seek a living either in Gujar\u00e1t or in Sind.\\(^1\\)\n\nOf the classes who in ordinary seasons move about the province, the chief are, of artisans, carpenters, blacksmiths, coppersmiths, masons, and weavers who with little capital go from town to town offering their services or selling their wares; of carriers, \u00c1hirs, with their bullock-carts, Ch\u00e1rans, Loh\u00e1n\u00e1s, and Memans with their pack bullocks, potters with their asses, and Sindic with their camels; and of the lower classes, shepherds, Ods or wandering diggers, cotton cleaners, and labourers, especially field labourers in harvest time. Of immigrants, polishers, blacksmiths known as Gad\u00e1li\u00e1s, and Ods, come from M\u00e1rv\u00e1r and return within the year; and in the cold and hot seasons traders from Cabul and coppersmiths from K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r come and sell their fruit and brass vessels, and return before the rains set in.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) According to the returns in 1862, 25,000 left; in 1863, 35,000; in 1864, 23,000; in 1865, 23,750; in 1866, 18,600; in 1867, 20,267; in 1868, 20,000; in 1870, 15,000; and in 1875, 50,000.\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nAGRICULTURE.\u00b9\n\nThe Cutch arable area is estimated at about 1,450,000 acres, of which about 600,000 belong to the Rao and 850,000 to smaller chiefs and landlords. As most of the soil is sandy and easily tilled, holdings are large averaging about thirty-five acres. The dry crops are generally sown in July, A'sh\u00e1d, and harvested at the beginning of October, A'so. About the time of the early harvest, cold weather crops are sown, all of them in watered garden lands. Watered hot-weather crops, sown in March, Chaitro, and reaped in June, Jeth, are liable to suffer from an early rainfall.\n\nThe ordinary field tools are: the plough, hal; the weeding plough or hoe, kal\u00eda or r\u00e1m; the seed drill, dant\u00e1l; the weeder, vikhedo or dhundiv; the hoe, kod\u00e1l\u00ed; the scythe, d\u00e1tardu; the hand hoe, kharpi; the rake, dant\u00e1l\u00ed; the scraping hoe, p\u00e1vdo; the leather water bag and lift, kos\u00b2; and for harvest work, a high stool; a leather-covered cane or iron winnowing fan, supdu; and a leather or leather-covered bamboo basket. Though its value is best understood in garden-land villages manure is carefully preserved throughout the country. In the dry weather, sheep and cattle are fed and stalled in the fields, and litter is laid about them and afterwards stored. House and yard sweepings are in most places carefully gathered. In the hot weather they are spread on the land, and the field ploughed or worked with the hand hoe, kod\u00e1l\u00ed. Less commonly, the soil is first loosened and then manured, an acre of watered land getting on an average from 30 to 40 cart-loads (11 to 15 tons) of manure. Bird dung, gathered from the floors of ruined buildings and from under trees where birds roost, is much used in growing melons, and rotten fish and castor-seed cakes are sometimes dug in round mango-tree roots. Bones and lime can be had in plenty, but until lately they were never utilized. Except that salt-earth is sometimes mixed with water to ripen irrigated crops and to improve clayey lands, salt is never used as a fertilizer. Salt lands are often improved by filling them with fine dust or blown sand, and\n\n\u00b9 Materials for great part of this chapter have been supplied by Mr. Vin\u00e1yakr\u00e1v N\u00e1r\u00e1yan N\u00e1ih Dhiv\u00e1n.\n\n\u00b2 The chief parts of the water-lift are, besides the leather bag, kos, two untanned leather ropes, a larger, varat, and a smaller, varatdi; two uprights supporting a wheel one foot nine inches in diameter and with a one foot long iron or wood axle, and close to the ground a wheel two feet two inches long and about six inches in diameter on which the smaller rope works.\ngardens, *v\u00e1dis*, by throwing into them road scrapings and pond silt. In no part of the province is the land burnt before it is sown. And except in one or two places as at J\u00e1tav\u00e1da in Pr\u00e1nthal, lands are seldom flooded that they may be enriched by the silt. In the alluvial coast tracts, *kunthi*, that it may be thoroughly turned, the soil is often dug instead of ploughed.\n\nAfter spreading his field with manure the husbandman ploughs it once or twice. The plough, drawn by one pair of bullocks, does not go more than three inches deep. A skilled cultivator rakes off roots, weeds, and dry sticks, and levels the ground. A less careful worker uses only the hoe, *kalia*, or in poor lands, fit only for pulse, does nothing till the rain falls. After the first rainfall (June - July) millet, *b\u00e1jri*, is sown, the seed being mostly covered by the harrow. After the millet is in, comes the sowing of cotton and of *guv\u00e1r* and *korad*, two kinds of early pulse. When millet, *b\u00e1jri*, and pulse, *guv\u00e1r* and *korad*, are about a foot high the space between the rows is loosened by a weeder, *vikhedo*. Millet is sometimes weeded by the hoe, both before and after the loosening, and is occasionally more than once loosened with the weeder, but for pulse one loosening is thought enough. When cotton plants are about a foot high, the earth about them is loosened by the weeder, hoed and weeded a second time, and after the second weeding, to wither the surface roots and drive down the main roots the best husbandmen again plough and level the field. In garden lands, *v\u00e1dis*, millet, *b\u00e1jri*, is chiefly grown. Cotton and Indian millet, *juw\u00e1r*, are seldom raised as garden crops. If the rainfall is timely, millet wants no water in the beginning of the season. But if there are no signs of rain before the end of June, *Jeth*, the field is ploughed and levelled, divided into beds, *ky\u00e1ras*, and the seed sown and watered. When the plants are about a foot high, the soil is twice weeded by the hand hoe, *kharpi*.\n\nThe harvest operations are: for cotton three pickings about the end of February at intervals of ten or fifteen days; for millet about the beginning of October, first the cutting of the heads and afterwards of the stalks; for Indian millet, also early in October, either the cutting of the heads and afterwards the rooting up of the stalks or the cutting of heads and stalks together about a foot from the ground; for early pulse, *mag* and *guv\u00e1r*, in October, the close cutting over by a shovel, and for *korad*, almost at the same time, the digging out by the hoe, *kharpi*.\n\nThe chief products are: of early, *kharij*, crops, millet, pulse, and cotton, and of late, *rabi*, crops, wheat, barley, gram, and rapeseed. Rice is not grown. Common millet, *b\u00e1jri*, *Penicillaria spicata*, one of the staple crops, is of two kinds, a small, *bhithro*, and a large, *mahudo*. Large millet sown in middling soils grows best when the land is slightly salt. Millet wants water and flourishes best as a garden crop. It is generally grown by itself. But in Abd\u00e1sa and V\u00e1gad it is sown with *mag* and *korad*. In Abd\u00e1sa each crop is reaped as it ripens, and in V\u00e1gad all three are cut together and separated after cleaning. In a mixed field, according to the quality\nof the soil, from two-thirds to three-fourths of the whole crop is millet. The yield of millet varies from sixty-fold in middling soil, to 250 fold in watered land. Indian millet, *juv\u00e1r*, Sorghum vulgare, is chiefly grown in clayey soils. It is rarely watered and is for the most part sown by itself. There are five chief sorts, *juv\u00e1r* and *puch\u00e1r*, sown in June or July soon after millet and cotton; *gund\u00e1l\u00ed* sown before the setting in of the cold weather or about the end of August (*Shr\u00e1van*); *chastio* sown about the end of February and grown by irrigation; and *ratad* sown in July and August with other grain as a dry crop, or in the hot season as a watered crop. The average yield of *juv\u00e1r* is about sixty-fold.\n\nWheat, *ghau*, Triticum aestivum, is chiefly irrigated. Unwatered wheat is grown only in parts of V\u00e1gad liable to flooding. Some soils in the coast alluvial lands, *k\u00e1nthi*, are suited to the growth of wheat, but they are of small area, and by the beginning of the cold weather the land is generally too dry for sowing wheat. Wheat is generally reaped in February (*M\u00e1ha*). The average produce of irrigated wheat is about fifteen-fold rising to thirty-fold in very good seasons. Barley, *jav*, Hordeum hexastichon, though less than wheat, is grown by irrigation. The climate, soil, and water seem suited to it. Like wheat it is reaped in January (*M\u00e1ha*). Sometimes, lest either crop should fail, a field is sown half with barley and half with wheat. *N\u00e1gli*, Eleusine corocana, and *banti*, Panicum spicatum, both cold weather crops, are grown only in small quantities and never without watering. They are found in the south alluvial plain, *k\u00e1nthi*, and in the plain, *m\u00e1k*, north-west of Bhuj about Dhinodhar.\n\n**Pulse.**\n\n*Korad*, Phaseolus aconitifolius, an early crop, is in the most sandy parts grown from year to year in nearly the same fields. It is for the most part sown by itself, but is sometimes mixed with *guv\u00e1r*. *Guv\u00e1r*, Cyamopsis psoralioides, an early, *kharif*, crop is largely grown in sandy loam, sometimes by itself, sometimes mixed with *korad*. A crop of *guv\u00e1r* is thought to do good to the soil. *Mag*, Phaseolus radiatus, like *guv\u00e1r*, an early crop, is grown in sandy loam. It is sown with millet and sometimes with the variety of Indian millet known as *puch\u00e1r*. In Cutch, *gram*, Cicer arietinum, a cold weather crop, is very little grown. *Adad*, Phaseolus mungo, and *chenna*, Panicum miliaceum, are sometimes grown in the cold weather in fields that have already yielded an early crop.\n\n**Oil-seeds.**\n\nCastor-oil seed, *orandia*, Ricinus communis, an early crop, is generally sown in the same field as cotton. In parts of Abd\u00e1sa and V\u00e1gad it is in a very few cases sown by itself. When sown together the proportion of castor seed to cotton seed varies from one-tenth to one-fifteenth. Two kinds of gingelly seed, *tal*, white and black, Sesamum indicum and Verbesina sativa, are grown in the rainy season. Sesamum is sown by itself chiefly in V\u00e1gad and parts of Abd\u00e1sa; in other places it is sown with cotton or millet. Rapeseed, *sarsav*, Brassica napus, is grown as a cold weather crop in watered lands, sometimes by itself and sometimes with wheat.\n\n**Fibres.**\n\nCotton, *ru*, Gossypium herbaceum, sown in clayey soils, is grown chiefly in V\u00e1gad, K\u00e1nthi, and eastern Abd\u00e1sa. It is of the yearly\nvariety called *aroda*, and like Dholera cotton is picked in its capsule. It is almost all grown as a dry crop and generally with castor seed, though of late years in some places the practice has been started of growing it by itself. It is picked twice or sometimes thrice about the end of February. The average outturn of clean cotton for the whole province may be estimated at from fifty to eighty pounds an acre.\n\nSugarcane, *serdi*, Saccharum officinarum, is grown only in small quantities, chiefly in central Cutch in the country cultivated by the Momna Kanbis, and about Anj\u00e1r and Mundra. Tobacco, *vajjar* or *bajjar*, Nicotiana tabacum, is grown only in small quantities. Among vegetables, carrots, *g\u00e1jar*, Daucus carota, rank first, Cutch being famous for its carrots used for fodder and pickling. Chillies, *marchi*, Capsicum annum, is a small, and onions, *k\u00e1nda*, Allium cepa, and garlic, *lasan*, Allium sativum, a large, crop sometimes exported to Bombay. Of fruits the mango, *umba*, Mangifera indica, and guava, *jamphal*, Psidium pyciferum, are by the help of water largely grown. The date palm, *kh\u00e1rek*, Phoenix sylvestris, is cultivated in some parts of the sandy water-bearing yellowish-brown soil. Inferior to those from Arabia, Persia, and Sind, the Cutch date is better than any other grown in western India. It is eaten as it ripens without drying or storing. The coconut, *n\u00e1riel*, Cocos nucifera; grape, *dar\u00e1kh*, Vitis vinifera; pomegranate, *d\u00e1dh\u00e1m*, Punica granatum; lemon, *limbu*, Citrus bergamia; *pap\u00eda* or *k\u00e1th chibda*, Carica papaya; and plantain, *kela*, Musa paradisiaca, are cultivated in small quantities. Melons of various kinds grow in profusion at all seasons. The best varieties, the grape and musk melons, are raised in river beds ripening in April, May, and June. The fruit of the *pilu*, Salvadora persica, about the size of a currant and yellowish or dark red, is pleasant, but sticky and so harsh as to blister the mouth.\n\nOf cultivating classes the chief in order of number are Osv\u00e1l V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, Rajputs or Gir\u00e1s\u00edas, including J\u00e1d\u00e9j\u00e1s and V\u00e1ghel\u00e1s; \u00c1hirs; Momna Kanbis; Leva Kanbis; Bhans\u00e1lis; Kumbh\u00e1rs; Suth\u00e1rs; and Bh\u00e1vs\u00e1rs. Of these, V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, Gir\u00e1s\u00eda Rajputs, Lev\u00e1s, and Karadia Rajputs are the most prosperous. In intelligence V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s hold the first place, but in industry they rank below Leva Kanbis. Gir\u00e1s\u00eda Rajputs are a well mannered class, some of them men of capital. In some respects, \u00c1hirs and Karadia Rajputs rank next to Gir\u00e1s\u00edas. But though stupid, Momna Kanbis are better cultivators. Bhans\u00e1lis, Kumbh\u00e1rs, Suth\u00e1rs, and Bh\u00e1vs\u00e1rs are indifferent husbandmen, the Kumbh\u00e1rs adding to the profits of their fields by occasionally acting as potters, bricklayers, and day-labourers. In V\u00e1gad, besides the above classes, M\u00e1lis, Br\u00e1hmans, Dheds, Khav\u00e1s also called Gol\u00e1s the descendants of Rajputs by slave girls, and others cultivate. On the whole the cultivators of Cutch are not generally in debt.\n\nAs the Cutch water-supply depends almost wholly on the rainfall, and as the rainfall is most uncertain, droughts are common. The saying is that a famine comes once every ten years. Blights are rare, but much damage is often done by locusts, and sometimes a\nlittle by frost. Of the early famines very little is known. In 1577 Cutch passed through a time of much distress. The well-to-do were ruined, and even large landlords, J\u0101ghird\u0101rs, were forced to seek help from the R\u0101o. During the latter half of the eighteenth century there were seven famine years, 1746, 1757, 1766, 1774, 1782, 1784, and 1791. The 1746 famine was severe. To relieve the poor the R\u0101o had large quantities of food cooked near the Bid or grain market gate at Bhuj, and allowed all who came to eat what they liked, and take home enough for one other person. The building erected on the cooking spot is still called Tota V\u0101li Varandi. In 1791 the rains failed and the country swarmed with black ants which were eaten in large quantities by the cattle. During the present century there have been many bad years. In 1803 a scarcity caused by locusts was in the next season followed by a failure of rain. Jam\u0101d\u0101r Fateh Muhammad, then at the head of the state, opened shops in Bhuj and sold grain at about twenty-six pounds the rupee (4 p\u0101tis the kori). Large numbers migrated to Sind and returned after rain fell. Nine years later (1813) came the fiercest and most destructive famine on record. Destitute and unruly bands passing to Sind plundered the villages, and grain was sold only in well guarded stores. Prices once rose to ten pounds the rupee (1\u00bd p\u0101tis the kori). To relieve the distress, work was offered on the Desalsar lake at Bhuj, on a daily wage of four-fifths of a pound (\u00bd p\u0101ti) of grain. Well guarded grain shops were also opened in Bhuj, M\u0101ndvi, Mundra, and Anj\u0101r, and private charity helped by giving daily doles of food. The distress, increased by bands of destitute wanderers on their way to Sind, was most severe. Many sold their children for food. A cat or dog was a delicacy and even human flesh was eaten. In 1815, still known as underiu or the rat year, a promising early harvest was destroyed by rats, which swarming over the fields carried off the ears of corn and stored them in their holes. In 1820 heavy rain rotted the grain and Indian millet and wheat were frost-bitten, grain prices rising to about thirty-nine pounds the rupee (6 p\u0101tis the kori). In 1825 the failure of rain caused great scarcity. To relieve the distress a large number of wells were dug, the Hamirsar lake was deepened, the workers receiving a daily wage of four-fifths of a pound (\u00bd p\u0101ti) of grain, and food was distributed both by the state and by private persons. In 1826 rats again appeared, but did less damage than in 1815. In 1834 the promise of a good harvest was destroyed by locusts, who ate every green thing, crops, grass, and tree leaves. One flight swept through Bhuj filling some of the houses so thickly as to put a stop to all cooking. Grain rose to twenty-six pounds the rupee (4 p\u0101tis the kori). 1839, 1841, and 1842 were years of want. R\u0101o Desalji employed the destitute in building several palaces and in working at the Hamirsar and Desalsar lakes. Between two and three thousand workers were employed, the daily wages being at the rate of 1\u00bd pounds (1 p\u0101ti) of grain for a man and four-fifths of a pound (\u00bd p\u0101ti) for a boy. 1846, 1849, and 1858 were years of short rainfall and failure of crops, with grain at from twenty six to thirty-nine pounds the rupee (4 to 6 p\u0101tis the kori). In 1861 an almost complete failure of rain caused much distress. Work was offered on the\nDesalsar and Hamirsar lakes, the labourers being paid a daily wage of $1\\frac{3}{5}$ pounds (1 p\u00e1t\u00ed) for a man and $\\frac{4}{5}$ of a pound ($\\frac{1}{2}$ p\u00e1t\u00ed) for a boy. Grain duties were remitted and at state stores grain was sold at from thirty-three to thirty-nine pounds the rupee (5 to 6 p\u00e1t\u00eds the kori). Between 1862 and 1877 came a succession of unfavourable seasons. In 1868 the state opened a store, pedhi, and sold grain at the rate of twenty-six pounds the rupee (4 p\u00e1t\u00eds the kori). In 1869 the promise of a good harvest was destroyed by locusts, and in the two following years the rain was scanty and the crops bad. The 1872 crops were damaged by locusts, and from scanty and unseasonable rain those of the next three years were so poor that many people were forced to leave Cutch. In 1877 the rain, though abundant, was unseasonable, the early crops failed and the scarcity pressed hard on the poorer classes. A kind of lark, banda, did much damage scraping the seed out of the fields. To relieve the distress half the grain import dues were remitted, wells were dug and works opened, chiefly the Tuna-Anj\u00e1r and M\u00e1ndvi-Bhuj roads. Local subscriptions were collected; some rich merchants sold grain at low prices; and supplies were forwarded for distribution by Cutch residents in Bombay.\nCHAPTER V.\n\nCAPITAL.\n\nExcept the fortunes made by traders settled in foreign parts, there is not much saving in Cutch. Townsmen spend their surplus income in making ornaments, house building, trading, and money lending. Villagers invest their savings in lending money or grain.\n\nMen of capital are, among Hindus chiefly Br\u00e1hmans, V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, Bh\u00e1ti\u00e1s, Loh\u00e1n\u00e1s, and Gos\u00e1\u00eds, and among Musalm\u00e1ns, Khoj\u00e1s, Memans, and Bohor\u00e1s. They number about 500, of whom about 400 have an estimated capital varying from \u00a33000 to \u00a35000 (Rs. 30,000 - 50,000); about eighty-five from \u00a35000 to \u00a330,000 (Rs. 50,000 - 3,00,000); and about fifteen of more than \u00a330,000 (Rs. 3,00,000). The Cutch banker keeps five books: (1) the journal, \u00e1vvo, bringing together for each day from the cash book, rojm\u00e9l, from the bill register, hundini nodh, and from other expansions, all transactions both cash and adjustments; (2) the ledger, kh\u00e1tavahi, containing an abstract of all entries made in the \u00e1vvo arranged in the order of their dates under the names of the persons to whom they refer; (3) Rokadvahi, containing all ready-paid items; (4) the bill register, j\u00e1ngadvaht, showing all bills of exchange issued and discharged; and (5) the h\u00e1thvahi or note book. Some bankers keep only two books, and only a few have a separate interest book, vi\u00e1jvahi. Money lending is a branch of most merchants' business. In towns the chief money-lenders are of Hindus, V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, Bh\u00e1ti\u00e1s, Atits, Br\u00e1hmans, and Loh\u00e1n\u00e1s, and of Musalm\u00e1ns, Bohor\u00e1s, Memans, and Khoj\u00e1s. In villages the chief money-lenders are, of Hindus, Rajputs, V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, Loh\u00e1n\u00e1s, Bh\u00e1ti\u00e1s, and Kanbis, and of Musalm\u00e1ns, Memans and Khoj\u00e1s. Small traders add to their capital by borrowing money at interest, using the advances partly in trade, and partly in lending at higher rates.\n\nAbout fifty Cutch firms hold the place of bankers issuing exchange bills, hundis, and lending money to traders. Bills of exchange for sums varying from \u00a31 to \u00a3700 (Rs. 10 - 7000) are freely issued and taken generally at a discount of from $\\frac{1}{8}$ to $\\frac{1}{4}$ per cent. Bills, for as much as \u00a320,000 (Rs. 2,00,000), are sometimes though rarely accepted. They are of two kinds, n\u00e1mjog, in which the payee's name, and sh\u00e1ljog, in which some distinguishing mark of the payee's, is entered. Some bills are paid at once, some, though payable at sight, are not paid till the day after presentation, and some are payable after a period of from one to ninety-one days. In the case of both of\nthese bills, the banker pays at his own risk. If a bill is lost a second called *peth* is given. A bill can be rejected either on presentation, or on the expiry of the term. But if the banker once binds himself on oath to accept the bill, he cannot reject it even though the issuer of the bill becomes insolvent in the interval. Bills are sold like any other commodity by making entries in the books of the seller and the buyer. In M\u00e1ndvi, Anj\u00e1r, and Mundra, the bill passes through the hands of a broker whose rates are one-twelfth per cent.\n\nOn loans a common craftsman has, on personal security, to pay yearly interest varying from nine to twelve per cent; a cultivator from six to twelve per cent; and a day labourer from twelve to fifteen per cent.\n\nThe R\u00e1o has a mint at which gold, silver, and copper coins are manufactured. The gold coins are the *r\u00e1vst\u00e1i mohor* equal to 100 silver *koris*, the half *mohor* equal to fifty silver *koris*, and the golden *kori* equal to 26\u00bd silver *koris*. The silver coins are the *p\u00e1nch\u00edo* equal to five silver *koris*, *ardhp\u00e1nch\u00edo* equal to 2\u00bd *koris*, the *kori* worth about one-fourth\u00b9 of the Imperial rupee, and the half *kori*. The copper coins are the *dhabu* equal to one-eighth of a *kori*, the *dholda* equal to \u00bcth of a *kori*, and the *tr\u00e1mbia* equal to \u00bcth of a *kori*. Up to the death of R\u00e1o Desalji II. (1860) these coins had on one side the name of the Emperor of Delhi in Persian, and on the other the name of the R\u00e1o in Devnagri characters. Since 1860 the name of Her Majesty the Queen-Empress Victoria has been substituted for that of the Delhi Emperor. Besides British Indian coins there are gold guineas, dollars of three kinds, *mohars* and *magarabis*, and silver dollars, *dharar\u00e1\u00eds*, *vil\u00e1s*, and *agari\u00e1s*; but they are not current and are taken by money changers at no fixed rates of discount.\n\nAmong Cutch bankers and traders cases of bankruptcy are rare. When a trader finds that he cannot meet his liabilities, he shuts his shop and storehouse, calls his creditors, and shows them how matters stand. The creditors choose some persons to audit the accounts, and if the bankrupt refuses to show his books, he is liable to be criminally prosecuted. When the inquiry is over, except the necessaries of life, his movable and immovable property is attached and divided rateably among his creditors. In cases, when he promises to pay so much in the rupee or by instalments, he is, by offering a surety, allowed to keep possession of his property.\n\nTwenty-five years ago carpenters and masons used to get 6d. (4 annas) a day, and ordinary day labourers 3d. (2 annas). The present daily wage of a carpenter or mason is 1s. 3d. (10 annas) and of a labourer 6d. (4 annas). As a rule labourers are paid in cash. During the present year (1879) at Bhuj the prices of the chief grains were: millet, *bajr\u014d*, *Penicillaria spicata*, seventeen and a half pounds the rupee; Indian millet, *juw\u0101r*, Sorghum vulgare, twenty-three pounds; Sindhi red rice, fifteen, and white, thirteen pounds; *mag*, Phaseolus radiatus, twenty-two pounds; *korad*,\n\n\u00b9 379 *koris* are equal to 100 Imperial rupees.\nPhaseolus aconitifolius, twenty-eight pounds, and wheat, Triticum aestivum, fifteen pounds the rupee.\n\nThe prices of millet, korad, and rice are available only for the years given in the following table:\n\n| Produce | 1745 | 1746 | 1747 | 1755 | 1756 | 1757 | 1764 | 1765 | 1766 | 1772 | 1773 | 1774 | 1775 | 1780 | 1801 | 1804 | 1811 |\n|---------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Bajro   |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Korad   |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Rice (Red) |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n\n| Produce | 1812 | 1813 | 1823 | 1834 | 1835 | 1836 | 1837 | 1838 | 1839 | 1840 | 1841 | 1844 | 1845 | 1847 | 1848 | 1849 | 1850 |\n|---------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Bajro   |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Korad   |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Rice (Red) |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n\n| Produce | 1861 | 1862 | 1863 | 1864 | 1865 | 1866 | 1867 | 1868 | 1869 | 1870 | 1871 | 1872 | 1873 | 1874 | 1875 | 1876 | 1877 |\n|---------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Bajro   |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Korad   |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Rice (Red) |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n\nBajro, millet, and pulse, korad, Phaseolus aconitifolius.\n\nWeights.\n\nGold and silver are sold by weight. The weights differ in different places. A piece of gold weighing 100 gadi\u00e1n\u00e1s at M\u00e1ndvi and Mundra will weigh at Bhuj 106 gadi\u00e1n\u00e1s. These metals are weighed according to the following scale: four mags, one rati; three ratis, one v\u00e1l; and sixteen v\u00e1ls, one gadi\u00e1no. Groceries, spices, alum, and all metals except gold and silver are sold by weight according to the following scale: four pais\u00e1bh\u00e1rs, one navt\u00e1nk; two navt\u00e1nks, one p\u00e1ser; two p\u00e1ser, one ardhs\u00e9r; two ardhsers, one ser; six sers, one p\u00e1ki p\u00e1nchseri; two p\u00e1nchseris, one dassero; two dasser\u00eds, one adhm\u00e1ni; two adhmans, one manki; and twenty mans, one kh\u00e1ndi. Pearls and precious stones are sold both by weight and number. In buying jewels a p\u00e1ka rupee contains 3\u00bd koris, and a k\u00e1cha rupee three koris. Opium is sold by weight according to the following scale: thirty-seven and a half juna dokd\u00e1s, one ser; and forty sers one man. In M\u00e1ndvi silk is sold by weight according to the following scale: thirty-five juna dokd\u00e1s, one p\u00e1ka ser; and forty p\u00e1ka sers, one p\u00e1ka man. Ivory when whole is sold according to the following scale: thirty-two juna dokd\u00e1s one ser; and fifty sers one man.\n\nMeasures.\n\nGrain is sold by cylinder-shaped capacity measures. The scale is: two chothl\u00e1, one pav\u00e1l\u00fa; two pav\u00e1l\u00fas, one p\u00e1ti or p\u00e1l\u00ed; two p\u00e1tv\u00eds, one tok\u00e1di\u00fa; two tok\u00e1di\u00e1s, one choiu; two choi\u00e1s, one m\u00e1p; four m\u00e1ps, one n\u00e1n\u00ed sai; four n\u00e1n\u00ed sais, one chosiu; two chosias,\n\n---\n\n1 At present a ser is equal to forty pais\u00e1s.\n2 There are two mans, a p\u00e1ki man of forty-eight, and a k\u00e1cho man of forty, sers.\n3 In Bhuj the sai containing eight m\u00e1ps is called moti sai.\none h\u00e1ro; two h\u00e1r\u00e1s, one kalsi; and ten kalsis, one mudo. Excepting flannel and woollen cloth which are sold by the yard, cloth is sold by the gaj. A Cutch gaj commonly called the l\u00e1kh\u00e1sai gaj is divided into twenty-four parts called tasus. In some places a gaj of the size of a man's fore-arm, called h\u00e1thia, is used. Trimming, kin\u00e1ri, is sold in bundles of eighteen v\u00e1lis each. Wood is sold by measuring its length and thickness by the his\u00e1bi gaj, which is 29\u00bd inches long. In M\u00e1ndvi and Anj\u00e1r wood is measured according to the following scale: twenty visv\u00e1sis, one visvo; and twenty visv\u00e1s, one gaj. In Mundra the scales are: twenty-four visv\u00e1sis, one visvo, and twenty-four visv\u00e1s, one gaj. In all state towns and villages the weights and measures are made and stamped by the state, and are thence purchased by the dealers for their own use.\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nTRADE AND MANUFACTURES.\n\nSECTION I.\u2014TRADE.\n\nThe only metalled roads in Cutch are thirty-six miles between Bhuj and M\u00e1ndvi, and ten miles between Anj\u00e1r and Tuna. Of fair weather tracks there are in all sixteen extending over a total distance of 762 miles. The chief are a road between Bhuj and Anj\u00e1r, twenty-four miles; between Mundra and M\u00e1ndvi, twenty-four miles; between Anj\u00e1r and Shik\u00e1rpur by Bhach\u00e1n, forty miles; between Bhuj and Lakhpat by Madh, eighty miles; between Bhuj and Mundra, twenty-three miles; between Anj\u00e1r and Mundra, twenty-four miles; between M\u00e1ndvi and Jakh\u00e1n, forty miles; between Bhuj and Bela by R\u00e1par, ninety-six miles; between Bhuj and Lakhpat by Koth\u00e1ra, ninety miles; between Koth\u00e1ra and N\u00e1r\u00e1yansar, forty miles; between Luna and M\u00e1ndvi, sixty-five miles; between Bebur and M\u00e1ndvi, fifty-four miles; between Kh\u00e1vda and Bhuj, thirty-two miles; between Bela and Anj\u00e1r, seventy-four miles; between Anj\u00e1r and Rohar, ten miles; and between Bela and Pal\u00e1nsva, thirty-six miles. Except in the Ran, where there is the risk of a chance plundering party, the roads may at all times, by day and night, be safely travelled.\n\nIn the districts of Abd\u00e1sza and K\u00e1nthi, along some of the public thoroughfares, charitable persons have built rest-houses, dharmsh\u00e1l\u00e1s. The state has built a travellers\u2019 bungalow and a large rest-house at Daisra, half way between Bhuj and M\u00e1ndvi, a smaller rest-house at Bit Assambia, between Daisra and M\u00e1ndvi, and a travellers\u2019 bungalow at M\u00e1ndvi.\n\nOf the different boats used in Cutch, one, the kot\u00eda comes ready made from the Malab\u00e1r coast. The rest are built in Cutch, at M\u00e1ndvi, Mundra, Tuna, and Jakh\u00e1n. The builders are Musalm\u00e1ns called V\u00e1dh\u00e1s and Hindu Suth\u00e1rs. The timber both for the hulls and for the masts comes from the Konkan, K\u00e1nara, and the Malab\u00e1r coast. The sails are made of cotton, woven in the villages round M\u00e1ndvi. The hulls are coloured with tar, and sometimes with paint, and caulked with cotton dipped in oil. When necessary, they are repaired by rubbing the upper parts of the hull with a mixture of cement, oil, and gugal, Balsamodendron mukul. In Cutch harbours, besides canoes, jolly boats, fishing boats, and ferry boats, six kinds of deep-sea trading vessels are found: the pad\u00e1v, n\u00e1vdi, kot\u00eda, ganjo, bagala, and batela. Canoes, hodi, dug out of a single tree trunk from 12 to 22\u00bd feet long and from 2\u00bd to 3 feet...\nbroad, from about 7 to 18 cwt. (12 - \u00bd kh\u00e1ndis) burden, and costing from \u00a35 to \u00a312 10s. (Rs. 50 - 125), are rowed by paddles, generally by a crew of three or four men, and are used chiefly for fishing and carrying passengers to and from ships. Cutch-built jolly boats from 10\u00bd to 19\u00bd feet long and 3\u00bd to 4\u00bd broad, and from about 14 cwt. to 1\u00bd tons (2 - 4 kh\u00e1ndis) burden, cost from \u00a320 to \u00a340 (Rs. 200 - 400). Besides four oars, they have a mast with one sail and a crew of from four to seven men. They are chiefly used in harbours to take sailors from one ship to another. The ferry boat, tar\u00e1, built in Cutch is from 9 to 12 feet long and 4\u00bd to 6 feet broad, and from about 1\u00bd to 2 tons (4 - 6 kh\u00e1ndis) burden. Costing from \u00a320 to \u00a330 (Rs. 200 - 300), it has paddles worked by one or two sailors. The fishing boat, machhva, is of two kinds, a large and a small, both built in Cutch. The small fishing boat 9 to 18 feet long and from 3\u00bd to 6\u00bd broad, is from 14\u00bd cwt. to 2\u00bd tons (2 - 6 kh\u00e1ndis) burden, and has a mast with one sail, four oars, and a crew of from two to four men. They are used for carrying passengers to and from ships and sometimes for fishing. The large machhva, about 27 feet long by 10\u00bd broad, about 28\u00bd tons (80 kh\u00e1ndis) burden, and costing from \u00a320 to \u00a360 (Rs. 200 - 600), has one mast and two sails and a crew of four or five men. They cruise between the Cutch and Sind ports, and are used to bring mangrove and other sea-growing timber.\n\nOf deep-sea trading boats there are the pad\u00e1v, from 27 to 37\u00bd feet long by 10\u00bd to 15 broad, of from 28\u00bd to 62\u00bd tons (80 - 175 kh\u00e1ndis) burden, and costing from \u00a3500 to \u00a3950 (Rs. 5000 - 9500). It has two masts and three sails and a crew of from four to seven men. They trade with K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Konkan, and Malab\u00e1r ports. The n\u00e1vdi, from 27 to 40\u00bd feet long by 10\u00bd to 12\u00bd broad, of from about 28 to 80 tons (80 - 225 kh\u00e1ndis) burden, and costing from \u00a3500 to \u00a31600 (Rs. 5000 - 16,000), has one mast and three sails, and a crew of from four to twelve men. The n\u00e1vdi trades with Bassora, Zanzib\u00e1r, and Maskat. The kot\u00eda, from 27 to 40\u00bd feet long by 10\u00bd to 16\u00bd broad, varying from about 28 to 80 tons (80 - 225 kh\u00e1ndis) burden, and costing from \u00a3500 to \u00a31650 (Rs. 5000 - 16,500), has three masts and two sails and a crew of from four to twelve men. The kot\u00eda sails to Zanzib\u00e1r, Maskat, and other ports, and is the chief trading vessel in Cutch. The ganjo, from 37\u00bd to 48 feet long by 15 to 19\u00bd broad, varying from 62\u00bd to 125 tons (175 - 380 kh\u00e1ndis) burden, and costing from \u00a31000 to \u00a32800 (Rs. 10,000 - 28,000), has three masts and three sails, and a crew of from eight to fifteen men. The ganjo trades to Zanzib\u00e1r, Maskat, and other ports. The batela, from 42 to 45 feet long by 10\u00bd to 18 broad, varying from about 28 to 125 tons (80 - 350 kh\u00e1ndis) burden, and costing from \u00a3500 to \u00a32400 (Rs. 5000 - 24,000) has two masts and three sails, and a crew of from four to twelve men. The batela trades to Zanzib\u00e1r, Maskat, and other distant ports. The bagala, from 42 to 57 feet long by 16\u00bd to 19\u00bd feet broad, varying from about 90 to 285 tons (250 - 800 kh\u00e1ndis) burden, and costing from \u00a31700 to \u00a33800 (Rs. 17,000 - 38,000), has two masts and three sails and a crew of from ten to twenty-four men. The bagala trades to Zanzib\u00e1r and Maskat, and other distant ports.\nSmall boats generally belong to sailors, and large ships to traders. In trading to Calcutta sailors are paid monthly salaries; for other voyages they get a lump sum, khal\u00e1s, for the trip. Besides this sum each man is given an allowance, bhatta, of nearly 3\u00bd pounds (2 p\u00e1tis) of grain a day. The grain is either bajri, Penicillaria spicata, wheat, or rice, whichever is cheapest. The captain, m\u00e1lam or n\u00e1khvo,\u00b9 is paid twice as much as the sailor. According to the present rate, in addition to the lump sum, the sailor\u2019s monthly bhatta amounts to about 10s. 6d. (20 koris). The captains, besides a lump sum, khal\u00e1s, and an allowance, bhatta, are paid a customary fee, k\u00fayado. The captains of Cutch trading boats know how to use the compass, and from a quadrant and pike staff can at noon calculate the latitude and longitude. They also have charts and a book on navigation called captain\u2019s tables, m\u00e1lamni his\u00e1lmi chopd\u00ed.\u00b2 Vessels that go no further than the Malab\u00e1r coast have no navigating captains, m\u00e1lams, but their commanders, n\u00e1khvo, are good sailors, skilled in the use of the compass. Cutch sailors are partly Hindus, partly Musalm\u00e1ns. The Hindus come from the south coast of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r and are called Kh\u00e1rv\u00e1s. Among the Musalm\u00e1n sailors those from Sind and J\u00e1farabad in south K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r are called Bhad\u00e1l\u00e1s. Part of them seem to be of a special tribe, the rest are Hindu converts, who, though Musalm\u00e1ns in habits, may still be known by their Hindu surnames. Two other classes, Miy\u00e1n\u00e1s and V\u00e1ghers, follow the calling of seamen.\n\nExcept between June and September when they do not ply, a British India steamer of from 600 to 900 tons, calls at M\u00e1ndvi once a week on its way from Bombay to Kurrachee, and another on its way from Kurrachee to Bombay. On the way from Bombay the steamer stops off Ver\u00e1val, M\u00e1ngrol, and Porbandar in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r generally taking about forty-eight hours on the way.\u00b3 At M\u00e1ndvi it has to lie a mile or two from the shore. The traffic is almost entirely in passengers. Besides the British India ships several small steamers, from 150 to 300 tons burden, some paddle and some screw, during the fair season (October - May) trade between Bombay and\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 The m\u00e1lam is the navigator, the n\u00e1khvo has charge of the men. Small vessels have only a n\u00e1khvo.\n\n\u00b2 Of the Cutch sailors and the voyages performed by them, Sir Alexander Burnes wrote in 1835: \u2018It will strike a European with some surprise when he finds these distant voyages performed by such vessels, and the more so, perhaps, when it is added that they are navigated with precision and no small skill by pilots who have acquired the use of the quadrant, and steer by charts. Some of these latter, indeed, exhibit an originality that would not, I am sure, be disputed by Eratosthenes, the first constructor of a map whose name has been handed down to posterity.\u2019 He describes one of their charts as \u2018a specimen of naval surveying unequalled in any of the cabinets of Europe,\u2019 and one which may supply some notion of the charts lost in the Alexandrian library. The natives of Cutch informed Sir Alexander Burnes that their communications with foreign nations had existed for many years, but that the knowledge of astronomy, navigation, ship-building, and other arts had been introduced into the country by a young Rajput of Cutch, now familiarly known as R\u00e1msing M\u00e1lam, who, a century since, had been carried to Holland, where he learnt those arts. Various charts and books, said to have been R\u00e1msing\u2019s property, were also shown, which fully corroborated the traditions of the people, Jour. Ro. Geog. Soc. VI. 27, 28.\n\n\u00b3 To Ver\u00e1val 24 hours; to M\u00e1ngrol 27; to Porbandar 36; and to M\u00e1ndvi 48.\nM\u00e1ndvi. They do not go beyond M\u00e1ndvi and on their way call at Diu, Ver\u00e1val, M\u00e1ngrol, and Porbandar. The time taken is generally about forty-eight hours. Like the British India ships they chiefly carry passengers though they sometimes take a little cotton and other cargo. In spite of steam competition, considerable trade still remains for the sailing boats, and in 1878-79 twenty-three new vessels aggregating 761 tons (2130 kh\u00e1ndis) were built at M\u00e1ndvi, against twenty-one vessels aggregating 1412\u00bd tons (3955 kh\u00e1ndis) built in the previous year.\n\nThere are in all nine harbours, bandars. Of these the most important, though little more than a roadstead, is M\u00e1ndvi on the gulf of Cutch thirty-six miles south-west from Bhuj. To improve the harbour, a breakwater to be called the M\u00e1ndvi Albert Edward Breakwater was begun on the 31st January 1878, and nearly 450 feet of the work have been completed. When this breakwater is finished, M\u00e1ndvi harbour will be little inferior to Kurrachee. At the end of 1877 there were, belonging to the M\u00e1ndvi port, 260 vessels of an aggregate burden of about 15,140 tons (42,390 kh\u00e1ndis), or to each vessel an average capacity of about 58 tons (163 kh\u00e1ndis). Next in importance to M\u00e1ndvi is Tuna about thirty-five miles south-east of Bhuj. Mundra, the third port, about twenty-six miles south of Bhuj, is a safe and sheltered harbour during the stormy season (June - October). The others, Rohar, V\u00e1v\u00e1nia, Jinjuda, Koteshvar, Jakh\u00e1n, and Lakhpat are minor ports. Lakhpat on the Sind frontier, about seventy-five years ago a great seat of commerce, has lost its importance partly from the development of trade at Kurrachee and partly from the shoaling of the mouth of the Kori river.\n\nThere are two light-houses in Cutch, a diopteric light of the fourth order at M\u00e1ndvi and a lantern at Tuna.\n\nEarly in the present century (1818) Cutch is said\u00b9 to have had a brisk trade with Bombay, the Malab\u00e1r coast, and Arabia, employing upwards of 800 boats of from about 14 to 180 tons (40 - 500 kh\u00e1ndis). The exports were chiefly cotton, silks masru, coarse cotton piece-goods, alum, and clarified butter. The imports were bullion from Mokha, ivory, rhinoceros horn and hides from east Africa, dates, cocoanuts, grain of all kinds, and timber from the Malab\u00e1r and Konkan coasts. In 1835 M\u00e1ndvi had no fewer than 250 vessels varying in size from 25 to 200 tons. They carried a large lateen sail with two masts. A maritime communication was kept up with Zanzib\u00e1r and the whole east coast of Africa, with the Red Sea and Arabia, with the Persian Gulf, Makr\u00e1n, Sind, and with India as far as Ceylon.\u00b2 The most valuable branch of traffic was with the\n\n\u00b9 Captain MacMurdo, 1818.

Soc. of Bombay, II. 230, 231.\n\u00b2 In their dealings with the Som\u00e1lis of \u2018Barbar\u2019 in Africa, outside the straits of Babel Mandeb, the V\u00e1v\u00eda traders had to suffer great hardships. Immediately a boat landed each person had to consign himself to a Som\u00e1li who became his db\u00e1n or security for life and property. This arrangement was absolutely necessary as the Som\u00e1lis were perfidious, bigoted, and quarrelsome. They used to swim off at night to European vessels and murder all the crew. For such protection the tax of a dollar, or less per head, and so much for each bale of cloth was exacted. Besides this the\neastern coast of Africa or 'Swally' as it was called in Cutch, the chief exports being cotton cloth, and the imports ivory, rhinoceros hides, and dollars. In 1837 the M\u00e1ndvi trade was chiefly with Bombay, Malab\u00e1r, Sind, Makr\u00e1n, Arabia, and Zanzib\u00e1r. The chief exports to Bombay were cotton, wool, red and white rice, wheat, and of pulses, *math* Phaseolus aconitifolius, *mag* Phaseolus radiatus, gram, *adad* Phaseolus mungo, clarified butter, and oil. From Daman Cutch brought of timber, teak and *kher* Acacia catechu, of a red colour much used in sugar mills, fine rice, and a fine cloth called *basti*, worth about \u00a33000 (Rs. 30,000) a year. Timber was the chief article of trade, fifty or sixty vessels coming every year to M\u00e1ndvi with cargoes worth about \u00a310,000 (Rs. 1,00,000). From Cochin came teak, blackwood *sisam*, *punai*, and *dhupla* for masts and yards, wooden basins, and jackwood worth altogether about \u00a320,000 (Rs. 2,00,000) a year, about 5,000,000 coconuts, 360 tons (1000 *kh\u00e1ndis*) of coir ropes, 2000 bundles of dried coconuts, 25,000,000 betel-nuts *sup\u00e1ris*, and 2062\u00bd tons (33,000 *mud\u00eds*) of rice; also cloth, *samada*, a substance used by sword-cleaners, and *patang* wood *C\u00e6salpinia sappan*, from which the red powder, *gul\u00e1l*, thrown about at *hol\u00ed* time and also used as a dye is extracted. From Sind came white and red rice, millet, turmeric *hald\u00ed*, lotus seed *pad\u00e1h*, and salt-fish. Cutch exported to Sind iron, steel, lead, tin, sugar, rice from Malab\u00e1r called *jir\u00e1sar*, betel-nuts, coir ropes *sind\u00e1ri*, coconuts, wooden basins *katrot*, dates *khajur*, dried dates *kh\u00e1riks*, teakwood rafters and bamboos, silk-cloth *masru*, cloves, cardamoms, cinnamon *d\u00e1lchini*, cubeb *kab\u00e1bchini*, frankincense *lob\u00e1n*, sandalwood, boxes of silk thread, English thread, snuff, sometimes cotton in times of scarcity in Sind, cloth from the Malab\u00e1r coast, white handkerchiefs; and of Bombay cloth, madapolams *mad\u00e1rp\u00e1t*, *b\u00e1sta*, *dori*, satin, sail-cloth, velvet, and chintz. About forty or fifty boats traded to the Makr\u00e1n coast. The exports were teak, blackwood, jackwood, boxes with locks, shields made of rhinoceros and elephant hides from Zanzib\u00e1r, silk-cloth *masru*, madapolams from Bombay, turmeric, cumin seed from M\u00e1rv\u00e1r, ginger and black pepper from Malab\u00e1r, dark blue cloth, and metals. In exchange there came from Makr\u00e1n clarified butter, rapeseed, wheat, and pulse. Only four or five boats were employed in the African coast trade. The goods exported from Cutch were about 500 bales a year of cloth of different kinds. The imports were *b\u00e1b\u00fal* Mimosa arabica, gum *kher*, and aloes *eriya*, used to adulterate opium and as a dye. To Mokha were sent\n\nV\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s were subjected to the most severe privations. After landing they were not permitted to wear a turban; if they died they were not allowed to be burned or buried, but a hole was dug into which they were put in an erect position and for which privilege they had to pay heavily. They had to drink water brought in skins of animals only recently killed by the Muhammadans. But their love of gain and the great profits derived from the trade overcame their sense of these hardships. In return for their cloth, the staple article of commerce, the V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s got goats, coffee, gum, and clarified butter, but chiefly dollars which the Som\u00e1l\u00eds brought from Harrar, a two months journey in the interior.

XV. 211-226.\nevery year about 10,000 bales of cotton and cloth, 400 bales of thread, 200 bamboo boxes kandy\u00e1s of snuff, 200 bales of sal ammoniac, 200 mans of borax, 250 mans of lac, lotus nuts, dried rice cakes, and about 10,000 wood and ivory combs. Hemp smoking mixture, g\u00e1nja, was much exported, nearly 300 mans a year, and toddy, local and Malab\u00e1r, about 150 casks each containing from 500 to 1000 bottles. Sesamum and grain were also exported. The imports were raisins khismis dr\u00e1kh and l\u00e1l dr\u00e1kh, almonds, dates, sweet tamarinds, berries, Bengal madder majith, aloes, sesqui-carbonate of soda s\u00e1ji kh\u00e1r, and coffee. Zanzib\u00e1r supplied Cutch with ivory, rhinoceros skins, cocoanuts, Indian millet, sometimes a rice called sahili, cakes of wax, sesamum oil, lemon pickle, cloves, mats, chandros resin from the Pinus sylvestris, and ox hides. There were about six vessels employed in this trade. They made one trip a year, starting in November-December, Pos, and coming back in April-May, Vais\u00e1kh. They took from Cutch, cloth, iron nails, anchors, cumin seed, and boxes with locks, twine for sewing sails, brass wire and brass bars for armlets and anklets, opium, shoes, and leather buckets.\n\nThe present trade of Cutch, though in some respects showing a falling off, is in its main features little changed. Of its two main branches, the sea and the land trade, the sea trade season lasts from August to May, all trade in the gulf of Cutch being at a standstill in the two stormy months of June and July. During the fair season there is a weekly coasting steamer from Kurrachee to Bombay. Of the different sailing-boat routes the first to open is, in August soon after cocoanut day, to Sind, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, and the Konkan; then in September to Bombay and the Malab\u00e1r coast; and in November-December to the Arab ports and Zanzib\u00e1r. The present trade to these ports is, with Kurrachee, of exports, Indian millet, pulse, chimad seeds used as a medicine, earthen jars, sails, silk and cotton cloth, and snuff; and of imports, millet, wheat, rice, gram, rape seed, lotus seed, fruit, clarified butter, gingelly oil, and mats. With K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, of exports, gum, cloves, dates, ivory, wax, dyed cloth, masru both silk and silk-cotton, embroidery, gold and silver work, and shields; and of imports, wheat, gram, pulse, adad Phaseolus mungo, chola Vigna catiang, and molasses. With Daman, Bals\u00e1r, and other Konkan ports, the exports are castor-oil seed, guv\u00e1r Cyamopsis psoraloides, and mag Phascolus radiatus; and the imports rice, gum, kh\u00e1nkhan a dye, tuver Cajanus indicus, ginger, cumin seed, anise seed suva, timber, leaves for native cheroots, and molasses. With Bombay the exports are alum, white clay, oxide of iron k\u00e1nyo a brown mineral dye, pulse korad Phaseolus aconitifolius, cotton, cotton seed, garlic chiefly produced about Anj\u00e1r, onions, gugal Balsamodendron mukul, chimad seeds used as an eye lotion, wool, embroidery, and gold and silver work; and the imports, metals, rice,\n\n---\n\n1 The salammoniac, borax, and lac came from M\u00e1rw\u00e1r.\n2 Gugal is one of the oldest of Cutch products. Al Birumi (1020) mentions Cutch as producing mukl, probably the bdellium of the ancients, the resin of the gugal or Balsamodendron mukul. Yule's Marco Polo, II. 331.\nChapter VI.\n\nTrade.\n\n1879.\n\nwheat, spices, sugar, sugarcandy, molasses, cloth, woollens and articles of European manufacture, carriages, furniture, fireworks, umbrellas, stationery, and matches. With the Malab\u00e1r ports, K\u00e1rw\u00e1r and Cochin, the imports are timber, cocoanuts, rice, betel-nuts, cardamoms, ginger, coffee, pepper, chillies, myrobalans harda, molasses, snuff, coir, and red powder gul\u00e1l. There are no exports direct to Malab\u00e1r. With the Persian Gulf the only article of export is dyed cloth, the imports are dates, wheat, gram, rice, millet, and raisins. With the Arab ports, the exports are mag Phaseolus radiatus, tobacco, inferior cotton, and dyed cloth; and the imports, rock salt saindhav, red ochre, grain, dates, raisins, pomegranates, dry rose flowers, and figs. With the African ports the exports are salt, horses, earthen pots, dyed cloth, and silk; and the imports, chandros resin from the Pinus sylvestris, timber, wheat, rice, millet, mag Phaseolus radiatus, tobacco, cocoanuts, cloves, molasses, sugar, wax, and ivory.\n\nLand Trade.\n\nThe Cutch land trade is chiefly across the Ran to Sind, and Thar and P\u00e1\u0301rkar. As noticed in the account of the Ran the chief lines are: one in the west from Nara in Cutch to Luna at the west end of the Banni and from there pretty straight north to Rahim-ki-b\u00e1z\u00e1r near Ali Bandar on the Kori river; and the other further east from Sumr\u00e1\u0301sar in Cutch north across the middle of the Banni along the west of Pachham to Bali\u00e1ri in Thar. A third route lies from the island of Bela north to Nagar. Though sometimes crossed even when flooded, these routes are little used except in the fair season between September and March. The traffic is almost entirely by camels, the centres of trade to which Cutch caravans go being Um\u00e1\u0301rkot in Sind and Thar. Besides these routes there are across the little Ran in the east several tracts fit in the fair season for the passage of carts. Along these trade passes chiefly to P\u00e1\u0301lanpur, Ahmedabad, and by pack bullocks to Ujain and M\u00e1rw\u00e1r.\n\nThe trading season lasts from the middle of September, Bh\u00e1\u0301darvo, to the middle of June, Jeth. The brisk season for cotton and seed is in April and May (Chaitar and Vais\u00e1\u0301khi), and that for other goods from October to April (A\u2019so to Chaitar). With Sind the chief exports are alum, dates, cocoanuts, madder, sugar, molasses, ivory, gold and silver work, embroidery, and cloth both cotton and silk; and the chief imports, carbonate of soda kh\u00e1\u0301ro, rice, millet j\u00fav\u00e1\u0301r Sorghum vulgare, maize, sesamum, turmeric, coriander seed, indigo, cheap molasses, lotus seed pab\u00e1di, bullocks, and buffaloes. With Thar and P\u00e1\u0301rkar the chief exports are dates, cocoanuts, ginger, betelnuts, pepper, chillies, garlic, sugar, molasses, and cloth; and the chief imports, millet b\u00e1\u0301fri Penicillaria spicata, mag Phaseolus radiatus, tal Sesamum indicum, math Phaseolus aconitifolius, g\u00fav\u00e1\u0301r Cyamopsis psoralioides, kh\u00e1nkh\u00e1n a dye, gugal Balsamodendron mukul, gum, and clarified butter. With P\u00e1\u0301lanpur the exports and imports are the same as P\u00e1\u0301rkar. With Ahmedabad the chief exports are alum, kamy\u00f3 a brown mineral dye, ivory, gold and silver work, and embroidery; and the imports, rice, tobacco, safflower, cumin seed, dry mangoes, and gold and silver brocade. With M\u00e1rw\u00e1r the chief exports are alum and ivory, the chief import is dyed cloth.\nOf late years, probably, chiefly owing to the centering of traffic along the railway lines, the through trade between the Cutch coast and Central India has much fallen off. To revive it the state has lately (1877), on goods sent inland from Cutch, granted a drawback of two-thirds of the duty paid on importing the articles by sea. The ivory trade with M\u00e1rw\u00e1r, formerly of considerable importance, has also of late years declined. The decline began some years ago on account of a dispute with the farmer of the ivory dues. Many of the workmen went to other places, but a few have (1877) been persuaded to return to M\u00e1ndvi. Taking the sea and land trade together the leading Cutch imports are metals, timber, grain, tobacco, dates, cocoanuts, betelnuts, spices, dry fruit, dye stuffs, sugar, molasses, ivory, animals, and silk and cotton cloth. The exports are alum, salt, clay, corn, cotton, castor oil seeds, tobacco, cocoanuts, dates, spices, garlic, sugar, wool, horses, ivory, earthen pots, cloth both cotton and silk, shields, embroidery, and gold and silver work. The chief changes in the trade of the past twenty-five years are, besides the falling off in the through trade, in the local trade under imports an increased demand for European goods, cotton cloth, plain, coloured and printed, and broadcloth, and for tables, chairs, couches, cots, and other articles of European house furniture. There is also a decline in the imports of timber and ivory, and the export of ivory and dyed cloth.\n\nIn the export trade the field produce pulse, cotton, cotton seed, and garlic, is by a V\u00e1ni\u00e1 or Bohora merchant generally bought in their villages from the growers, and re-sold by him to one of the wholesale traders in the sea ports and other trade centres. Occasionally when produce is in special demand the export traders send agents into the villages and buy up what they can. Bombay and Cutch are very closely connected in trade, most of the leading Cutch merchants having either agents, branches, or their chief houses in Bombay. The importers, generally Bh\u00e1ti\u00e1s, V\u00e1ni\u00e1s, Loh\u00e1n\u00e1s, and Khoj\u00e1s are men of capital with agents or branch houses in Bombay and Zanzib\u00e1r. They generally re-sell to country town and village dealers, chiefly Loh\u00e1n\u00e1s and V\u00e1ni\u00e1s, who sell either in country towns and villages, or at fairs. The internal trade centers in the towns of M\u00e1ndvi, Mundra, Anj\u00e1r, Jakh\u00e1u, and Nalia. In small villages only those articles which are bought for the daily consumption of the villagers can be obtained. The system of retail trade prevails to a great extent. When large purchases have to be made for a marriage or other ceremony, or when timber is wanted for house building, people generally buy in the sea-port towns. Some Bohoras and others during the fair season move about as pedlars, selling cloth, spices, and articles of hardware.\n\nMost wholesale dealings in bills of exchange, metal, grain, cloth, butter, and oil are conducted through brokers, dal\u00e1s. The broker is paid by one or both parties according to the custom of the particular branch of trade. The rates are one-half per cent on gold and silver, one per cent on jewels, and one-twelfth per cent on exchange bills. The grain brokerage varies, depending on the\nprevailing prices. Brokers are held responsible for the correctness of their weights and measures. They cannot practise without the leave of a revenue officer, who has power to suspend or even dismiss them, and they have to agree that while working as brokers they will carry on no independent trade. In some places they have to pay the state a certain percentage of their earnings.\n\nIt is the practice in Cutch to insure ships and cargoes against loss at sea, and sometimes goods carried across the Ran are also insured. At M\u00e1ndvi the state has appointed six members of the merchant guild, mah\u00e1jan, to superintend insurance transactions. These are settled through brokers, and a person who has once bound himself on oath to a broker is never released. The brokerage rates in insurance by land are one-twelfth per cent, half paid by the underwriter and half by the insured. Imported goods are not insured. Until the goods are safely delivered to the consignee the insuring agent is liable, but only in the case of their being robbed, burnt, or otherwise lost. The two chief modes of insurance are avang and v\u00edmo. In avang the underwriter pays some money in advance, which with interest at about $\\frac{1}{2}$ per cent (6 annas) is returned by the insurer when his goods have safely arrived. In v\u00edmo the money is paid after the goods or ships have been lost. Responsibility begins when the goods are shipped. It is not necessary that they should be insured at their real value. Insurance rates are higher in the busy than in the slack season, and are always raised in the rains and stormy weather. Usually the avang rate varies from $3\\frac{1}{4}$ to eight per cent, and the v\u00edmo from $3\\frac{1}{4}$ to four per cent.\n\nIn most Cutch towns there is a merchant's guild, mah\u00e1jan. At the sea ports some of its members are appointed by the state to fix, in insurance questions, the amount to be paid for damage to the ship or cargo. Their awards are respected by both parties. The guild derives an income from a tax known by the name of dharmo lago. This is levied by the state along with the excise duties and its proceeds are handed over to the guild manager. The income is spent partly in offerings to the Valabh\u00e1ch\u00e1rya Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1s and partly in the support of animal homes. Most of the leading members of the guilds are V\u00e1n\u00ed\u015b and Bh\u00e1ti\u00e1s.\n\nSECTION II.\u2014MANUFACTURES.\n\nOf the manufacture of alum some details have been given under the head \"Productions\" (p. 19,20).\n\nCutch has long been famous for the superior design and workmanship of its gold and silver ware. The ornaments most in demand are cups, flagons, flower vases, cigar cases, egg stands, tea and coffee services, muffineers, rose-water sprinklers, and salvers. This industry is (1879) carried on only in Bhuj and there only by a very few families. The best gold worker in Bhuj is by caste a carpenter, and\n\n---\n\n1 This as well as the Population, Agriculture, and Trade Chapters owe much to additions and corrections supplied by Mr. Ratanji Kcsavji Koth\u00e1ri of Bhuj.\nof the rest one is by caste a coppersmith and another a shoemaker. Besides these, several M\u00e1rv\u00e1di goldsmiths are employed by the R\u00e1o to make common jewels and other women's ornaments. The three first named goldsmiths are men of capital, making and selling on their own account. The rest are workmen, earning from 9d. to 1s. (6 - 8 annas) a day. Especially when the demand is brisk, the leading craftsmen keep a large staff of workers. They buy what gold and silver they want from V\u00e1nia, Bh\u00e1tia, and Khoja merchants, who bring most of it from Bombay and the rest from Zanzib\u00e1r. The workmanship, whatever be the nature of the article, is much the same and varies only with the skill and patience of the artist. Some of them amuse themselves with eccentricities in the shape of animals; others copy European patterns, entirely unsuited to their style of art. The best eschew novelties, and keep to old favourite shapes and traceries.\n\nAll work on the same plan. Moulded into the required shape, the silver plate is filled with a wax called kil; the design is traced on the surface of the silver and worked by driving it in from outside by a small nail and hammer. This work over, the plate is softened by fire, the molten wax poured out, fresh wax filled in, and the design again worked on it. Sometimes the operation is repeated a third time. When the design is properly executed, the wax is taken out, and the outside of the vessel polished. The rough inner surface is sometimes covered by a coating of polished silver. It is then ready for sale. The sharper and deeper cut the tracing, the better is the work. The present market value of the articles is 3s. 6d. (Re. 1 - annas 12) for every rupee's weight of silver. A school of design has lately (1877) been started at Bhuj, and it is hoped that it may raise to its former level the silversmith's art, lowered of late years by the use of European patterns, and the ease with which cheap work can be sold. The sons of many carpenters, goldsmiths, and Rajputs have joined this school. The lessons are given by a Christian teacher sent from the Bombay School of Art. Private silversmiths generally work articles ordered from Bombay, or other parts of the country, or, if they have no orders, make articles and either directly or through agents try to sell them. The prices charged leave them a good profit. Their instruments vary in value from \u00a35 4s. to \u00a313 (Rs. 52 - 130). Including twenty-four elevenths, agy\u00e1ras, and twelve dark fifteenths, am\u00e1s, they rest from work forty-five days in the year. Though proverbially ready to cheat, the goldsmiths, especially those who do European work, are said to be thrifty and hardworking. They form four guilds, jam\u00e1ts, V\u00e1nia-son\u00eds, Kans\u00e1ra-son\u00eds, Suth\u00e1ra-son\u00eds and Musalm\u00e1n-son\u00eds of the Meman sect found chiefly in Abd\u00e1sa. Each of the above guilds has an alderman, a code of rules, and a fund formed from a marriage cess, the hire of vessels used at feasts, and fines for breaches of rules. This fund is, according to the will of the alderman and the committee, panch, spent on religious objects, building or repairing places of worship, buying a store of public cooking vessels, and on guild feasts. Almost all goldsmiths are able to save. Very few send their children to school, and none of them have risen to high position.\n\nFour hundred Hindu families from M\u00e1rv\u00e1r came to Bhuj about 250 Copper Work.\nyears ago. Taking refuge in the temple of Maha K\u00e1li, they were ordered by her to work as coppersmiths. At present about 100 families remain, who follow this craft in Bhuj, Anj\u00e1r, M\u00e1ndvi, Roha, and Lakhp\u00e1t. They work in copper, brass, bell-metal, tin, and pewter, and prepare jars, plates, dishes, cups, and large pots, h\u00e1ndis. In making these articles, suitable pieces of metal are hammered on a wooden block, moulded into the required shape, and their joints cemented. The metal is brought from M\u00e1ndvi and Anj\u00e1r by V\u00e1nia, Bh\u00e1tia, and Loh\u00e1na merchants, who get it from Bombay and sell it retail to the coppersmiths. A few use English tools, but their tools are generally bought from local blacksmiths. Some have capital, and others are labourers. The workmen earn about 1s. (8 annas) a day. Many are able to save, and only a few are poor. Their pots and other produce are largely sold at fairs. Including twenty-four elevenths, agy\u00e1ras, and twelve dark fifteenths, am\u00e1s, they keep fifty holidays in the year. They are hardworking and thrifty, but have no very high character for honesty. They have a trade guild and a fund raised and spent in the same way as the goldsmiths' fund.\n\nThere are fifty-three families of blacksmiths, descended from one Surji, who 300 years ago came to Bhuj from Jun\u00e1g\u00e9d in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. Of these one works as a goldsmith and two as carpenters. Most of them make locks, keys, pots for household purposes, and field and artisan's tools. A few make spades, shovels, knives, scissors, razors, and other cutlery after English patterns, and of good workmanship. Good swords, daggers, spears, and muskets are also made; but none are exported. In 1837 Bhuj iron-workers were able to turn out a flint or even a percussion lock, which many an Englishman would not be ashamed to own as his production. Although they have no capital, the Luh\u00e1rs are well-to-do. The rains (June - October) is their busy season. They earn from 6d. to 2s. (4 as. - 1 Re.) a day, and are on the whole a saving community. Village Luh\u00e1rs are generally paid in grain. Although not very honest, the Luh\u00e1rs are thriving and hardworking. Including twenty-four elevenths, agy\u00e1ras, and twelve dark fifteenths, am\u00e1s, they keep forty holidays in the year.\n\nThere are eight families of gilders said to have come from Delhi to Bhuj. Of these seven are Musalm\u00e1n and belong to the blacksmith class. They cover brass ornaments and sometimes copper and brass pots either with gold or silver. In gilding or silvering, Delhi-made gold or silver leaves, or Cutch-made wire is pressed into the lines of a pattern, cut by a sharp pointed iron tool into the face of a metal vessel and then polished. They have no capital of their own and are generally forced to borrow money from traders. Most of them work and sell on their own account. Others hire themselves out as workmen, earning on an average about 1s. 3d. (10 as.) a day. During the year, Musalm\u00e1ns keep eleven and Hindus ten holidays. With no very good name for honesty, these people are hardworking and thrifty.\n\n---\n\n1 Mrs. Postans, 48. Dr. Burnes (1830) mentions a Bhuj gun-lock passing for English. Hist. of Cutch, viii.\nTwenty Musalm\u00e1n families came from Sind with the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s as polishers. They polish and sharpen knives and swords. They are poor and without capital. In January and February when their trade is at its best, they earn from 9d. to 1s. (6 - 8 as.) a day. They keep all the Muhammadan holidays. Very few send their children to school. They are thrifty and hardworking.\n\nCutch masons are well known for their skill in stone cutting and for the delicacy and excellence of their designs. They are Hindus of two classes, sompar\u00e1s, immigrants from M\u00e1rw\u00e1r, and kumbh\u00e1rs, people of Cutch. Living in a province very rich in building-stone, the Cutch masons have carried the art of stone-carving to great perfection. The bases and capitals of the pillars and open tracery in the new Bhuj palace, and in some Cutch Shravak temples show much variety of design and fineness of work. They are a sober, hardworking, and thrifty class with a trade guild much like that of the goldsmiths. Many Cutch masons go to different parts of western India in search of work.\n\nCarpenters, suth\u00e1rs, chiefly from Gujar\u00e1t, have been settled in Cutch from a very early date. Nearly 2000 families, 1200 Hindu and 800 Musalm\u00e1n, are scattered over the province. Except b\u00e1bul, pipal, bordi, kando\u00e1nt, and khijdo, almost all the timber used in Cutch comes from Daman and the Malab\u00e1r coast. Of the 2000 families about sixty are said to have capital, varying from about \u00a320 to \u00a31000 (Rs. 200 - 10,000) earned in many cases by working in foreign parts. The rest are workmen earning from 1s. 7d. to 2s. 7d. (as. 12 pies 8 - Re. 1 as. 4 pies 8) a day. Rising at six they work from eight to twelve, rest, and again work from two to six. Skilled carpenters generally save, investing their money in ornaments. Among the Hindus, caste influence is strong, and caste dinners are given on occasions of marriage and death. They may follow any other craft, but are not allowed to drink wine. They rarely send their children to school. It is said that, in former times, a carpenter, suth\u00e1r, was not thought to be skilled in his calling, unless he had read a book called Rajvallabh, treating of the principles of carpentry mixed with much religious teaching. Originally in Sanscrit, this book was translated into Pr\u00e1krit. No Gujar\u00e1t\u00ed version has been made, and as the carpenters are uneducated, it is now seldom read.\n\nAbout 200 Musalm\u00e1n families, chiefly from M\u00e1rw\u00e1r spin cotton in Bhuj. All of them labourers, in their brisk season, February and March, Ph\u00e1g\u00e1n, they earn from 4\u00bdd. to 6d. (3 - 4 annas) a day, but the demand for their work is not very steady. Including fifty-two Fridays they keep about sixty holidays in the year. Children are very seldom sent to school. Wine is forbidden.\n\nDark-blue and black cotton cloth used to be woven in large quantities for export to Zanzib\u00e1r. Three varieties known as jodi, sadiamu, and bungan were much valued for the fastness of the dye. Of late the trade has fallen off. But it is hoped that the recent lowering of dues may help to restore it.\n\nThere are about fifty families of Hindu embroiderers. About 250 years ago a Musalm\u00e1n beggar, fakir, skilled in embroidery, is said\nto have come from Sind, and taught his art to some families of the shoemaker, mochi, caste, who both in Bhuj and M\u00e1ndvi are famous for their skill. They work in silk, with a hooked needle like a broad awl on silk cloth, mashru, on broadcloth, net, and canvas. With a silk thread in one hand, the artist works with the other without any design sketched on the cloth or even placed before him, and with wonderful speed forms letters, leaves, fruit, flowers, animals, and human figures. Some of them keep for sale a stock of caps, tapes, cushions, bodices and robes, while others make them to order. Fifteen of the families are well-to-do, making up and exporting large quantities of embroidery, and with from about \u00a35 to \u00a350 (Rs. 50 - 500) invested in their business. In their busy season, January, the marriage time, the workmen earn from 1s. \u00bdd. to 2s. 7\u00bdd. (as. 8 pies 4 - Re. 1 as. 5) a day. Including twelve dark fifteenths, amids, they keep eighteen holidays in the year. Hardworking, sober, and thrifty, they invest their savings in developing their business. So highly is their skill valued that K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r and other chiefs employ them, and their work is in great demand over all India and is sent to Zanzib\u00e1r.\n\nThirteen Hindu families of the braid weaving, j\u00e1gr\u00eda, caste, are said to have come from M\u00e1rv\u00e1r under an invitation from His Highness the R\u00e1o. Some of them are settled in Bhuj and some in Anj\u00e1r. They are workmen, carrying out orders from traders, and when engaged, earn from 3d. to 9d. (2 6 annas) a day. They do not always get work, have no busy season, and are not in a position to save. When their work is slackest, generally in October, February, and April, they make considerable sums as exorcists, driving out spirits by beating the small d\u00e1khs, drum. They keep four holidays in the year and do not give caste dinners. Wine is forbidden them. Their children are not sent to school.\n\nThere are about 165 families of dyers, 112 of them Musalm\u00e1ns, the descendants of converts from the Khombh\u00e1tri and Khatri castes, and 53 of them Hindus of the Khatri caste. Some 250 years ago, the R\u00e1o asked their ancestors to come from Sind to Bhuj. Of the whole number of dyers only a few are well off, the rest are workmen earning from 4\u00bd to 7\u00bdd. (3 - 5 annas) a day. The Hindu and Musalm\u00e1n Khatris generally dyeing in fast indigo, dark-blue and black colours, are better off than the Musalm\u00e1ns of the Khombh\u00e1tri caste, who dye women's robes, scarves, and handkerchiefs, in light soon fading shades. The Khatris have work throughout the year, but during the rainy season the Khombh\u00e1tris are nearly idle. The busy season of both is in the month of January, Posh. The Hindus keep ten, and the Musalm\u00e1ns eleven yearly holidays. As a class they are hardworking and thrifty, and both have guilds for settling their trade disputes.\n\nSilk weaving is carried on to a large extent only in M\u00e1ndvi. The raw silk comes from China, Bengal, and Bokh\u00e1ra, generally through Bombay merchants. The silk weavers are of the Khatri caste, most of them well-to-do. Some save money and invest it in their business; others work for wages among their own caste people.\ngetting from 6\u00bdd. to 9\u00bdd. (as. 4 - 6\u00bd) a day. Silks are dyed by Khatris, partly Hindus partly Musalmans, in pits dug on the banks of the dry river Rukhmavati where the water is said to give specially clear and lasting colours. Some of the silk is used locally, and the rest sent to Gujar\u00e1t, K\u00e1thi\u00e1war, and Bombay. The dealers are Shravak and Vaishnav Vani\u00e1s, and P\u00e1todis a class of Khatris. Of late silk weaving has greatly fallen off. An attempt has been made to revive it by lowering duties. Their busy time is in the marriage season, during the months of December and January (M\u00e1gsar and Posh). Including twenty-four elevenths, agy\u00e1ras, they observe forty yearly holidays.\n\nThe M\u00e1ndvi Khatris to a small extent print silk by knotting. The process is the same as in other parts of Gujar\u00e1t; the consumption is almost entirely local.\n\nThere are in Bhuj about fifteen Musalm\u00e1n families of painters, kam\u00e1ngar, who are said to have come from Delhi. They make toys, shields, and sticks, and colour them with different dyes. Shield-making is one of the special Cutch industries. The kam\u00e1ngars import rhinoceros and elephant hides from Zanzib\u00e1r, work them into semi-transparent discs of various sizes, paint them, and without any help from leather workers mount them as shields. The fewer the flaws and stains the greater is the value of the shield. Measuring generally about 2\u00bd feet across, the rhinoceros shields vary in price from 2s. to \u00a310 (Rs. 1 - 100). Those for nobles and chiefs are gold or silver mounted, and sometimes studded with gems. Shield makers have no particular busy season, and in the rains are more or less idle. Their average daily earnings are about 1s. (as. 8). They keep eleven yearly holidays, and though hardworking and thrifty, are not able to save.\n\nThere are 300 families of oil pressers, thirty of them Gh\u00e1chis and the rest Ch\u00e1kis and Bohor\u00e1s. They make oil from sesamum, rape seed, castor seed, and cocoanut kernels. They have no capital and all are workmen earning from about 6d. to 1s. (as. 4 - 8) a day. They are busy in December, January and February, but at other times do not always get work. Including fifty-two Fridays, the Musalmans keep sixty-eight holidays. Though hardworking, thrifty, and temperate, they are not able to save. They rarely send their children to school.\n\nThere are seventy-five families of wood and ivory bracelet makers, chudgars or mani\u00e1rs, twenty-five of them Hindus and the rest Musalmans. They live at M\u00e1ndvi, Bhuj, and Anj\u00e1r. The Musalmans' ancestors were Rajput horse-dealers, who about 250 years ago were converted to Isl\u00e1m, and according to the story, were taught bracelet making by a holy man of Kodin\u00e1r near Jun\u00e1gad. Since then they go by the name of mani\u00e1rs, from mani, the Sindhi for a bracelet. They work chiefly in ivory and blackwood, and also make small boxes of rhinoceros hide. Ivory bracelets are of two sorts, edged and without edges. The edged are always covered in the middle by gold foil, those without edges have no gold. Blackwood bracelets are always edged, and covered either with brass,\nsilver, or gold. The materials are supplied by M\u00e1ndvi and Anj\u00e1r traders, chiefly V\u00e1ni\u00e1s and Bh\u00e1t\u00edas, who bring the ivory from Zanzib\u00e1r and the blackwood from the Malab\u00e1r coast. The mani\u00e1rs are men of capital with from about \u00a35 to \u00a350 (Rs. 50 - 500) invested in their business. They earn from 6d. to 2s. 6d. (as. 4 - Re. 1\u00bd) a day. Including twenty-four elevenths, agy\u00e1ras, and twelve dark fifteenths, am\u00e1s, the Hindus observe forty holidays, and the Musalm\u00e1ns eleven. Although hardworking they are not in a position to save.\n\nTanning.\n\nFifteen Musalm\u00e1n families of tanners, said to have come from H\u00e1l\u00e1r in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, live in Bhuj and Anj\u00e1r. They buy the leather from butchers and Dheds, and dyes from Musalm\u00e1n or Hindu grocers, g\u00e1ndhis. Their trade depends on the leather supply, which is generally as much as is wanted for local consumption. They earn from about 4\u00bdd. to 7\u00bdd. (as. 3 - 5) a day. Including fifty-two Fridays they keep fifty-eight holidays in the year. They are hardworking and sober.\n\nBasket Making.\n\nThere are twenty-five Rajput families of basket makers, thirteen at M\u00e1ndvi and the rest scattered over the province, said to be the descendants of six brothers, who, 300 years ago, first made bamboo baskets for M\u00e1ta Bauchar\u00e1ji. They work with bamboos brought from the Malab\u00e1r coast by V\u00e1nia and Bh\u00e1tia merchants. They buy a year's supply at a time, bury them below high tide mark, and take them out when wanted. Their busy season is from November to February. They generally work at home, and keep nearly sixty holidays in the year. They are hardworking and thrifty, and as a class are fairly well-to-do.\n\nShoe Making.\n\nThere are five hundred families of Gujar\u00e1t Hindu shoemakers, settled chiefly at Bhuj. The Meghv\u00e1ls, another class of Hindu shoemakers do not mix with them. About seventy-five of them have capital, varying from \u00a310 to \u00a350 (Rs. 100 - 500) invested in ornaments or lent at interest. They earn from 9d. to 1s. 3d., (as. 6 - 10) a day. They keep sixteen holidays in the year, and are sober and hardworking.\n\nCandles and Matches.\n\nIn 1877 an attempt was made, with some state help, to start a candle and match factory in Bhuj. But it did not pay and had to be closed.\n\nConfectionery.\n\nAbout 150 families, five of them Musalm\u00e1ns, make sweetmeats either in their shops or in their customers' houses. Hardworking and thrifty, some of them have capital and are able to save, investing their earnings in ornaments. They earn from about 6d. to 2s. 7d. (as. 4 - Re. 1\u00bd - 4\u00bd) a day. Including twenty-four elevenths, agy\u00e1ras, and twelve dark fifteenths, am\u00e1s, they keep about forty holidays in the year.\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nHISTORY.\n\nThe history of Cutch may be roughly divided into two periods, an ancient and a modern, before and after the Samma or Jadeja conquest about the beginning of the fourteenth century. In old Hindu writings the country is, under the name of Kachchha or coast land, spoken of as a desert with few and wild people. So it remained till a holy man, losing himself in the forests on his way from the Narayan Sarovar or lake of Narayan in the extreme west, cleared the country by fire. From the ashes sprang crops of grass so rich that large numbers of pastoral tribes settled in Cutch.\u00b9\n\nThe earliest historic notices of Cutch are in the Greek writers. In examining the eastern branch of the river Indus, Alexander (325 B.C.) came to a great lake, formed either by the spreading of the river or the flowing together of the neighbouring waters. The entrance was easier than the entrance of the western mouth, and, to ensure a regular supply of fresh water, wells were dug along the coast.\u00b2 About 150 years later (142-124 B.C.) Cutch was part of Menander's kingdom, which stretched from the Jamna to Saurashtra.\u00b3 Soon after this (120 B.C.) the Graeco-Baktrian empire was overthrown, and Skythians, known to the Indians as Saka or Min, passing south established themselves in Cutch and other parts of north Gujar\u00e1t. Defeated by Vikramaditya, about 56 B.C., they came back between twenty and thirty years later, and under Yeukaotschin founded a dynasty which in turn was, in the first century of the Christian era, overthrown by Parthians whose power stretched from Sind as far south as Broach.\u2074 In the first century after Christ, Pliny's (77 A.D.)\n\n\u00b9 McMurdo, Bom. Lit. Soc. Trans. II. 218 (New Ed.).\n\u00b2 Arrian, VI. xx. 3. Rooke's Trans., 168. The wells seem to have been dug to the west of the Indus mouth and not as Vincent (Com. of the Ancients, I. 178) supposed in Cutch. Vivien de St. Martin Geographie Greque et Latine de l'Inde, 177, Note 5.\n\u00b3 V. de St. Martin as above, 193, Note 3. For three or four hundred years traces of Bactrian temples, altars, fortified camps, and large masonry wells remained. C. Wilford, quoted in Burgess' Arch. Sur. Rep. 1874-1875, 190. C. Wilford, As. Res. IX. 183, explains Strabo's (66 B.C.-24 A.D.) Tejarashtra as the country of Tej, according to him, one of the earliest settlements in Cutch. See below, \"Places of Interest,\" Tej. Wilson (Ariana Antiqua, 212) for Tejarashtra reads Sarasota and identifies it with Saurashtra.\n\u2074 McCrindle's Periplus, 108, Note 39. Of the Skythian conquest traces remain in the names of Indo-Skythia and Skythia given by Ptolemy (Bertius, 7102) and the author of the Periplus (Vincent, II. 392) to Sind and the country north of Cutch. The return of the Skythians (30-20 B.C.) closely corresponds with the appearance of the Mudgals, who in the time of Vikram overran Cutch and carried off everything to their own country. Ras Mala, 7. A trace of the Parthians, the Paradu of Sanskrit writers, was, in 1830, found in a number of coins dug out of the fort of Punvar. See Punvaranagad under \"Manjal,\" p. 235.\nOdambari are generally taken to have been the people of Cutch, and Ptolemy's (150 A.D.) town of Orbadari to the east of the Indus to have been their head-quarters. Ptolemy knew the gulf of Cutch as K\u00e1nthi, a name still applied to the strip of land along its north shore, and to the Kanthkot fort near the south shore of the Ran. About a hundred years later (246) the author of the Periplus speaks of the outer part of the gulf of Cutch as Barake. Further in, he says, is the gulf of Eirinon (the Sanscrit ir\u012bna 'a salt marsh', the modern Ran), divided into two parts, a greater and a less, both unexplored, dangerous to ships, shallow, and with violent eddies. The country along the coast of the gulf, which both he and Ptolemy call Surastrene, was rich, yielding in abundance corn, rice, sesamum, butter, and cotton for ordinary manufacture, the people were tall and black, and they had many herds. Except perhaps at a port near Kurrachee where Ptolemy has a station of the K\u00e1nthi ships, the Greeks would seem to have had no direct trade with Cutch. The gulf of Eirinon is spoken of as a place to be shunned, and all trade centred in Broach. Soon after the time of the author of the Periplus, Cutch was conquered by the S\u00e1h (140-380 A.D.) kings of Saur\u00e1shtra, and then, probably after forming part of the Gupta dominions, came about the end of the fifth century under the Valabhi kings.\n\nIn the seventh century (about 640) Cutch was part of the province of Sind. It is described by the Chinese pilgrim Hiouen Thsang as lying 267 miles (1600 lis) south-west of the capital of Sind, at that time Alor near Bhakar on the Indus. He calls it Otien-po-chi-lo, which M. Julien renders Adhyavakila, and General Cunningham would connect with Pliny's Odambira. The circuit of the province is given at 833 miles (5000 lis) and that of the capital at five miles (30 lis). The capital's name is Kie-tsi-shi-fa-lo perhaps Koteshvar.\n\n---\n\n1 V. de St. Martin as above, 246. The form of the word in Bostock's Pliny (II. 48) is Odonheores. The name seems to survive in the Audumbaras, a Brahman sub-division pretty widely spread over north Gujar\u00e1t. The Audumbaras are mentioned in the Hariv\u00e9msa as a royal race.

Asvakachha mentioned in the list of subject lands is supposed to be Cutch. Burgess' Arch. Sur. Rep. 1874-75, 131.\n\n7 Ditto, 138. From an uncertainty as to the reckoning of eras these dates are doubtful.\n\n8 Julien's Hiouen Thsang, I. 207, 208.\n\n9 Cunningham's Ancient Geography of India, I. 303. Julien reads the name of the capital Khajeshvara, and Lassen Kachchesvara. See below, \"Places of Interest.\" Mr. Burgess quotes another part of Hiouen Thsang's itinerary (Julien, 205, 206) as referring to Cutch. It is a place Kie-ch'a said to be about 500 miles (3000 lis) in circuit, and with a capital 3\u00bd miles (20 lis) round. The name comes closer to Kachh than that of the other passage, but the account of the country seems strangely inapplicable. Thickly peopled and rich, under M\u00e1wa, and like it in climate, produce, and in the people's customs. Arch. Sur. Rep. 1874-75, 190.\nThe next mention of Cutch is that early in the eighth century (about 714), on the death of Pram\u00e1r of Telegu, Cutch was given to the Ch\u00e1rans. Soon after this the K\u00e1this would seem to have passed into Cutch from Sind, and with their head-quarters at P\u00e1vargad, were probably the ruling tribe, especially in the centre and south of the province. At this time the chief other Cutch tribe would seem to have been the Ch\u00e1vd\u00e1s in the east, whose power by the help of the kings of Panch\u00e1sar and Anhilv\u00e1da, probably increased in the eighth and ninth centuries. In the tenth century, when, by the accession of Mulr\u00e1j Solanki, the Ch\u00e1vd\u00e1s were ousted from Anhilv\u00e1da they retired to Cutch. Shortly afterwards (about 950), when pressed by the Ch\u00e1luky\u00e1s of Kaly\u00e1n, Mulr\u00e1j Solanki occupied Kanthkot. During this time the Arabs, beginning with raids on the K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r and Gujar\u00e1t coasts, had completed the conquest of Sind. In the ninth century they had made settlements on the Cutch coast, and in the beginning of the tenth the province was considered part of Sind. Al Biruni (970-1039) speaks of Cutch by its present name and notices that one branch of the Indus flows into the Sind S\u00e1g\u00e1r on the borders of Cutch. The chief references to Cutch in the writings of the Arab travellers of the tenth and eleventh centuries are connected with its pirates, who, with their head-quarters at Cutch and Somn\u00e1th, were, from the word Baira a boat, known as Bawarij.\n\nEarly in the eleventh century (1023) Bhimdev I. (1022-1072) of Anhilv\u00e1da fled before Mahmud of Ghazni to Kanthkot (Kanda Kot). Like Mulr\u00e1j he held the whole of V\u00e1gad and two of his grants dispose of Cutch villages. About the close of the century\n\n---\n\n1 Chand quoted in Tod's Annals of R\u00e1jasth\u00e1n, I. 84. According to Musalm\u00e1n historians Cutch was part of the dominions of the king of Alor. Bom. Gov. Sel. XIII. 8.\n2 Burgess' Arch. Sur. Rep. 1874-75, 191. With the K\u00e1this the \u00c1hirs were associated. Ditto. About 750, says Colonel Tod, the K\u00e1this crossed the Ran in their passage from Mult\u00e1n, and established themselves in the regions of the Sauras. Western India, 155.\n3 About 942, writes Major J. W. Watson, one of the queens of Samantsinha, by tribe a Bhati\u00e1na, fled to her father's house in Jesalmer with her infant son, then a child of a year old. This boy was named Ah\u00edpat, and when he grew to man's estate became a formidable outlaw and used to ravage the Patan dominions. He conquered nine hundred villages in Cutch, and built Morgad, which he made the seat of his government, and here consolidating his rule he reigned for many years. He was succeeded by his son Vikramsi, whose son was Vibhur\u00e1ja. Vibhur\u00e1ja was succeeded by his son Takuli, whose son and successor was Seshkaranji. Seshkaranji was succeeded by his son V\u00e1ghhi, who was succeeded by his son Akher\u00e1ja, and Akher\u00e1ja was succeeded by his son Tejas\u00ed, Tejas\u00ed by Karamsinha, and Karamsinha by T\u00e1khansinha, T\u00e1khansinha by Mokamsinha, and Mokamsinha by Punj\u00e1ji.

They went on till the close of the thirteenth century, making their head-quarters at Socotra where they encamped and sold the spoil, the Christians of the island gladly buying it, knowing well that it was Saracen or Pagan gear.

This took place or at least was completed, during the fourteenth century. Samm\u00e1s are said to have begun to come into Cutch several centuries before, probably during Musalm\u00e1n rule in Sind (712 - 1051).\\(^5\\) Early in the thirteenth century, at the time of Shams-ud-din Altamsh\u2019s (1211 - 1236) conquest of Sind, other bands of Samm\u00e1s seem to have retired into Cutch.\\(^6\\) According to local tradition the reason of the Samm\u00e1s coming to Cutch was a quarrel among the sons of a Sind Samma chief by name L\u00e1kha. On L\u00e1kha\u2019s death two of his younger sons, Mod and Man\u00e1\u00ed plotted against the rightful successor, their elder brother Unad or Umar. Their plot failing they were forced to fly to Cutch, where Mod\u2019s uncle V\u00e1gam, a Ch\u00e1vda chief, ruled in P\u00e1tgad on the Rau. V\u00e1gam received his nephews kindly. But after a short time they rose against him, took his fort, and put him to death. This outrage brought on the brothers the wrath of V\u00e1gam\u2019s over-lord the V\u00e1ghela of Gunthli. To please him the brothers promised to double V\u00e1gam\u2019s tribute, and agreed that one of them should remain hostage in Gunthli. Part of the tribute\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Burgess\u2019 Arch. Sur.

Two causes probably helped to drive the Samm\u00e1s south into Cutch: the ruin in eastern Sind caused (about 1000) by the change in the course of the Indus, and the persecutions, in 1005, 1175, and 1237, (Elliot, II. 575) by orthodox Musalm\u00e1ns of the Karmatians to which sect some at least of the Samm\u00e1s seem to have belonged. (See below, \u201cJ\u00e1d\u00e9j\u00e1s\u201d).\n\n\\(^6\\) For Shams-ud-din\u2019s conquest of Sind see Tabak\u00e1t-i-N\u00e1siri in Elliot, II. 326, and Elphinstone, 373, 374 (1866, 5th Ed.). Besides by Shams-ud-din, Sind was at this time conquered by Nasir-nd-din, Shams-ud-din\u2019s wife\u2019s uncle, and by Jal\u00e1l-ud-din the refugee ruler of Kh\u00e1rizm. This date (1225) agrees very closely with the traditional account of the arrival of the Samm\u00e1s in Cutch given in the text. It also fits in well with statements in the confused Musalm\u00e1n histories of the Sind Sumra dynasty (1025 - 1315), that about the middle of the thirteenth century there were Samm\u00e1s in Cutch more or less dependent on the Sumr\u00e1s. T\u00e1rikh-i-M\u00e1sum\u00ed in Elliot, I. 218. Tuhf\u00e1tu-l-Kir\u00e1m in Elliot, I. 345; see also ditto, 486. The arrival of the Samm\u00e1s, says MacMurdo (Trans. Bom. Lit. Soc. II. 216), took place before the end of the thirteenth century and probably much earlier. Tod (Western India, 470) places Umar as far back as 1053. But even according to Col. Tod\u2019s table, counting back from R\u00e1o Kheng\u00e1rji (1637) the first certain date, 1053 is nearly a century too early.\nwas a payment of fourteen cart-loads of grass. One year, under the grass, warriors were hid. Leaving their hiding place at night they took possession of the fort of Gunthli and drove the V\u00e1ghel\u00e1s across the gulf into K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. After this success Mod ruled as chief of western Cutch. S\u00e1d who came next, was, about 1305, after a reign of fifteen years, succeeded by his son Phul, and he, about 1320, by L\u00e1kha Phul\u00e1n\u00ed. Meanwhile, according to the Musalm\u00e1n historians of Sind, the Sumr\u00e1s whose head-quarters were at Muhammad Tur, after being defeated by Al\u00e1-ud-din Khilji (1295-1315) about the close of the thirteenth century, so oppressed the Samm\u00e1s, the ancient landholders, that they retired to Cutch. Shortly after another Musalm\u00e1n invasion took place, Muhammad Tur the Sumra capital was destroyed, and the Sumr\u00e1s\u2019 wives and children were sent for protection to the Samm\u00e1s of Cutch. On their arrival in Cutch the Samm\u00e1s at first settled in the desert. After a time they begged the chiefs, who were Ch\u00e1vda Rajputs, to grant them a tract of land. This was agreed to, and on condition of making over the grass to the Ch\u00e1vda chief as tribute they were allowed to keep the grain. The story of their capture of Gunthli and their rise to power in Cutch is the same as that already given from Cutch traditions. The two accounts so far agree that the year 1320, when, according to Musalm\u00e1n accounts, the last bands of the Samm\u00e1s arrived, is, according to Cutch tradition, the date of the accession of L\u00e1kha Phul\u00e1n\u00ed the hero of Cutch legend, who, ruling at Ker\u00e1kot, completed the conquest of Cutch, subdued the K\u00e1th\u00eds, and was slain about 1340 fighting in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r.\n\nAt the time of the Samma conquest Cutch is described as a land of deserts and hills. It would seem to have been thinly peopled by K\u00e1th\u00eds in the south and by Ch\u00e1vd\u00e1s and V\u00e1ghel\u00e1s in other parts. The K\u00e1th\u00eds were driven across the gulf, but the Ch\u00e1vd\u00e1s remained \u2018once the masters now the tenants,\u2019 and were consulted when any well or pond was to be dug.\n\nL\u00e1kha Phul\u00e1n\u00ed was succeeded by his nephew Pura or Punvaro G\u00e1v\u00e1ni, who after a short reign was killed by the Yaksh\u00e1s. Pura left two younger brothers Detha and Setha, but as neither of them was\n\n---\n\n1 Col. Barton\u2019s Tour in Cutch, 1878, 9,10. Postans in Jour. As. Soc. Beng.

Elliot, I. 403,404.\n3 The Musalm\u00e1n historians of Al\u00e1-ud-din\u2019s reign do not mention his invasion of Sind, and the Firoz Sh\u00e1hi in giving an account of Firoz Tughluk\u2019s success (1361) speaks of Al\u00e1-ud-din\u2019s expedition as a failure. T\u00e1rikh-i-Firoz Sh\u00e1hi: Elliot, III. 337. But the Sind T\u00e1rikh-i-T\u00e1hiri speaks of an invasion and complete defeat of the Sumr\u00e1s, and soon after (1315) the change of dynasty from Sumr\u00e1s to Samm\u00e1s seems to show that the Sumra power was crushed.

In Cutch the name Yaksh\u00e1s seems also to be applied to a much older race of northern invaders.\nChapter VII.\n\nHistory.\n\nL\u00e1kha J\u00e1deja, 1350-1365.\n\nfit to manage the state, Pura's widow sent to Sind and brought over L\u00e1kha the son of J\u00e1da. L\u00e1kha's reign is said to have begun about 1350, and to have lasted for fifteen years. Some of the former Samma rulers of Cutch had spread their power to the south of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. During L\u00e1kha's reign, according to the Hindu account from the fierce opposition of some of the K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r tribes, but more probably driven back by the great Muhammad Tughlik (1325-1351), their territories were reduced to the peninsular part of Cutch. After their power was confined within Cutch limits, the ruling tribe came to be known as J\u00e1dej\u00e1s, and to be marked by the systematic destruction of their female children. That J\u00e1deja, or the children of J\u00e1da, was a new name, seems probable, though there is some evidence to support the view that the name is old, and that it was the conversion to Isl\u00e1m of the Tatta Samm\u00e1s, the head of their tribe, that brought into importance the little known sub-division of J\u00e1dej\u00e1s. Infanticide was no doubt an early practice. Still, at this time, the spread of Isl\u00e1m among the tribes of lower Sind and the isolation of the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s in Cutch, by increasing marriage difficulties, strengthened the temptation to destroy female children. The J\u00e1dej\u00e1s would seem to have been one of the Sind tribes who, in the tenth century, were converted to the tenets of the Karmatians. When the leading branch of the Samm\u00e1s adopted the orthodox form of Isl\u00e1m the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s seem to have kept to their old half-Hindu, half-Musalm\u00e1n faith. The names of their rulers continue Hindu, while those of the Tatta Jams are Musalm\u00e1n; and Salah-ud-din (1393-1404), the first Samma convert to Isl\u00e1m, marked his reign by a fierce and successful attack on the rulers of Cutch.\n\nRata R\u00e1yadhan, 1365.\n\nL\u00e1kha was, according to the traditions, about 1365, succeeded by his son Rata R\u00e1yadhan, called the Red from the red scarf he used to tie round his turban. After an uneventful reign Rata R\u00e1yadhan died, leaving three sons, D\u00e1darji, Oth\u00e1ji, Gajanji, and a fourth Hothiji by a different mother. The three full brothers divided the land into four parts, two for the eldest and one for each of the others, twelve villages being set apart for Hothiji the fourth son. D\u00e1darji's chief town was Kanthkot.\n\n---\n\n1 J\u00e1da was the son of S\u00e1ndh the son of Tam\u00e1chi Samma the son of J\u00e1m Unad the elder brother of Mod. Burgess' A-ch. Sur.

Ghumli in south-west K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, now in Porbandar, is said to have been, early in the 14th century, taken and destroyed by one Bahmani Samma from Cutch.\n3 Muhammad Tughlik (1325-1351) very completely established his power in north-west Gujar\u00e1t. The Cutch chief is mentioned as paying him tribute. Elliot, III, 294; Bird, 170. It was about this time (1361) that Firoz Tughlik's army was all but destroyed in the Ran. In that war no mention of the Cutch chief occurs.\n4 Details are given in the \"Population\" chapter (p. 57).\n5 Details are given below (p. 184).\n6 T\u00e1rikh-i-M'asumi : Elliot, I, 227. The Samm\u00e1s were Hindus when conquered by Firoz Tughlik (1361). Their conversion does not date earlier than 1391. Elliot, I, 496.\n7 Rata R\u00e1yadhan has, by Dr. J. Wilson, been thought to be the J\u00e1m R\u00e1i Dan, who coming from Cutch succeeded in 1454 (858 H.) to the throne of Tatta in Sind. (T\u00e1rikh-i-M'asumi in Elliot, I, 230). But besides the difference of nearly 100 years, the Sind R\u00e1i Dan would seem to have belonged to the Tatta family, and to have lived in Cutch only as a refugee. In spite of his name the Sind R\u00e1i Dan would seem to have been a Muhammedan (see Elliot, I, 231).\nin the east, Oth\u00e1ji's head-quarters were Aj\u00e1pur to the north-east of Bhuj not far from the Haba hills, and Gajauji lived at B\u00e1ra near Tera in the west.\n\nEarly in the fifteenth century (1410) Muzafar Sh\u00e1h (1390-1411), the founder of the Ahmedabad dynasty, defeated the chief of Kanthkot. In spite of this defeat, though nominally subject to Ahmedabad, Cutch remained independent till, in 1472, Mahmud Begada (1459-1511), going against them with only 300 cavalry, attacked and defeated a force of 4000 archers. The Cutohis submitted, and being asked by Mahmud what their religion was, said they were men of the desert, without teachers; the king promised to send them teachers, and many of the chiefs who went back with him to Jun\u00e1gad embraced Isl\u00e1m.\n\nIn the beginning of the sixteenth century the Cutch chief would seem to have been on no friendly terms with the Arghun dynasty (1519-1543), the overthrowers of the Tatta Samm\u00e1s. According to the Sind historians on one occasion, about 1530, Sh\u00e1h Husain (1522-1544) entered Cutch, and inflicted on the R\u00e1o a severe defeat. At this time the representatives of the three branches of the J\u00e1d\u00e9ja family were J\u00e1m D\u00e1darji, J\u00e1m Hamirji, and J\u00e1m R\u00e1val. Of these J\u00e1m Hamirji and J\u00e1m R\u00e1val were neighbours and rivals, and in 1537, R\u00e1val, by a solemn promise of friendship drawing Hamir into his power, killed him. At the time of J\u00e1m Hamir's death, Aliy\u00e1ji, the eldest of his four sons, was on a visit to his sister, the wife of the Ahmedabad king; and Kheng\u00e1rji the second son, was on a visit at Vir\u00e1w\u00e1h in P\u00e1rkar. The two youngest sons, S\u00e1hebji and R\u00e1yabji, were secretly carried off to R\u00e1par in V\u00e1gad; and Kheng\u00e1r, returning from P\u00e1rkar, took them with him to Ahmedabad, where they were joined by a number of their family and followers. At an Ahmedabad hunting party, Kheng\u00e1r, though only a lad of fourteen, slew a tiger with his sword. Pleased with the lad's courage the king promised to grant him any thing he might ask. Kheng\u00e1r asked that he and his followers might settle for a time at Morvi on the Ran. The territory was made over to him in perpetuity, and Kheng\u00e1r was ennobled with the title of R\u00e1o. From Morvi Kheng\u00e1r kept constantly attacking the villages of J\u00e1m D\u00e1darji, who was then on friendly terms with J\u00e1m R\u00e1val. He also tried to get leave to settle in R\u00e1par, and after an unsuccessful attempt, succeeded. He next, by the help of his relation the Hothi chief, tempted the R\u00e1par chief out of his fort, and slaying both him and his sons took his possessions.

Settled as ruler of Cutch, Kheng\u00e1r determined to make Bhuj his capital. The country round had long been a favourite haunt of robbers and marauders. After much difficulty they were driven out, and, his dependents agreeing to settle there, Kheng\u00e1r's capital was established.\n\nDying in 1585 Kheng\u00e1r was succeeded by Bh\u00e1rmal who ruled till 1631. During his reign the government of Gujar\u00e1t passed from the Ahmedabad kings to the Moghal Emperors. Under the Ahmedabad kings the Cutch chief remained to the last paying no regular tribute, but bound to serve with 5000 horse.\\(^2\\) When their power ceased Bh\u00e1rmal seems to have attempted to make himself independent, but after two defeats, in 1590 and 1591, agreeing to admit the supremacy of the Moghal Emperor, he was confirmed in his former position, and was only occasionally called on to pay tribute.\\(^3\\)\n\nOf the state of Cutch at the close of the sixteenth century, the author of the \u00c1\u00edn-i-Akbar\u00ed (1583-1590) has left the following details:\\(^4\\) The greater part was composed of woods and untilled lands. Its horses, supposed to be of Arab blood, its camels, and its goats were remarkably good. Its men, once J\u00e1davas, now named Jadej\u00e1s, were tall, handsome, and long-bearded. The Muhammadan religion had for long prevailed. The military force of the country was 10,000 cavalry and 50,000 infantry. The capital was Bhuj (written T\u00e1hej) and there were two strong forts, B\u00e1ra and Kanthkot.\n\nIn 1617 Bh\u00e1rmal went to Ahmedabad to pay his respects to the Emperor Jah\u00e1ngir, presenting him with 100 Cutch horses, 100 ashraf\u00eds,\\(^5\\) and 2000 rupees. He is spoken of as one of the greatest Zamind\u00e1rs in Gujar\u00e1t, who had always from 5000 to 6000 horse, and was able in time of war to double the number.\\(^6\\) Jah\u00e1ngir,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Bom.

In 1590 Rao Bh\u00e1rmalji, on promise of the Morvi estate, was base enough to give up to Mirza Aziz Kokaltash, Akbar's general, the ex-king Muzafar who had taken shelter with him. Displeased with the Rao's treachery and delighted with the courage shewn by the Bet chief in fighting in Muzafar's defence, Akbar is said to have set up two stones, p\u00e1l\u00e1s, at one of the Delhi gates and ordered all passers-by to crown the Bet chief's stone with flowers and beat the Jadeja's with a slipper. The practice was not given up till J\u00e1m Desal (1718-1741), allowed to offer any suit, asked that the stone might be taken away. Tod's Western India, 438. The chief of Bhuj, called Sulhm\u00e1nnagar, paid tribute when it was enforced. Bird, 136.

At the same time, on the condition of giving pilgrims a passage to Mecca, he freed Cutch from tribute. On his death in 1631 Bh\u00e1rmal was succeeded by Bhojr\u00e1j, who, ruling till 1645, was succeeded by his nephew Kheng\u00e1r II. Dying in 1654, Kheng\u00e1r was succeeded by Tam\u00e1chi, and he by R\u00e1yadhan in 1662. These successions passed without a contest and during this period Cutch seems to have enjoyed unbroken peace. The only event of importance was, in 1659, the arrival of the unfortunate prince D\u00e1ra, a fugitive from Aurangzeb. Tam\u00e1chi at first received him kindly, but afterwards, turning against him, forced him to leave Cutch.\n\nNoghanji, R\u00e1yadhan's eldest son, died young, and during his father's lifetime Pr\u00e1gmalji, R\u00e1yadhan's third son, contrived the murder of his elder brother Rav\u00e1ji. Both the brothers had left sons who were entitled to succeed; but as they were young, Pr\u00e1gmalji, on his father's death in 1697, found no difficulty in seizing the throne. When K\u00e1nyoji, the son of Rav\u00e1ji whom Pr\u00e1gmalji had murdered, became a man, he left no means untried to win back his birth-right. On assuming power in 1697 (S. 1754) Pr\u00e1gmalji had placed him in command of Morvi, on the southern shore of the gulf of Cutch, a possession still held by his descendants. From Morvi, K\u00e1nyoji made almost yearly raids into Cutch. But the ruler of Bhuj was too strong for him, and he was always worsted. During this reign Tam\u00e1chi, the sixth in descent from H\u00e1la, driven from H\u00e1l\u00e1r, came to Pr\u00e1gmalji, who sending his son Godji with a strong force restored him. After a successful reign of eighteen years Pr\u00e1gmalji died in 1715. He was succeeded by his son Godji, to whose vigour and courage the success of the last reign had been almost entirely due. Of Godji's short reign of three years (1715-1718) the chief event was despoiling H\u00e1loji, the son of Pr\u00e1gmalji's eldest brother Noghanji, of his estate of Mundra. H\u00e1loji unable to resist retired to Abd\u00e1sa, and there founded the towns of Koth\u00e1ra, Ko\u00edri, and Nagarchi. His descendants are known as H\u00e1l\u00e1n\u00ed J\u00e1dej\u00e1s.\n\nDying in 1718 Godji was without opposition succeeded by his son Desal (1718-1741), a man in the prime of life, handsome, and of pleasing and courteous manners. At this time the revenues of the R\u00e1os of Cutch were extremely small. Before the reign of Godji they were chiefly derived from the trifling trade of their seaport Anj\u00e1r; from the Kora sub-division; from\n\n---\n\n1 Watson's History of Gujar\u00e1t, 70.

The lands of Mundra and K\u00e1nthi and Anj\u00e1r Chovisi, added during Godji\u2019s reign, brought an important increase of revenue. Still the R\u00e1os\u2019 income was scanty, and their way of living very frugal and simple. Among his brotherhood the R\u00e1o claimed no greater supremacy than what was due to his title and larger resources. Sheltered by the friendly feeling of his relations and servants, he lived safe and unguarded, without crippling his resources by the pay of mercenaries. The leading J\u00e1dej\u00e1s had all lately received their possessions, and as, up to this time, the ties of relationship had scarcely been broken, habit and duty inclined them to obey their common chief. Friendly intercourse and mutual support formed a bond of union between the R\u00e1o and his nominal feudatories, in striking contrast to the rivalry and discord of later years. At this time the H\u00e1l\u00e1nis had not long settled in Abd\u00e1s\u00e1; the God\u00e1nis or sons of R\u00e1o Godji, were in their new lands in the K\u00e1nthi; the S\u00e1hebs, including the long established chiefs of Roha and Mothala, were continued in their estates; and Tera was allotted to one of the sons of R\u00e1o R\u00e1yadhan I. These estates, including the best lands and the richest towns in the province, were well peopled, peasants as well as traders being always ready to leave their houses and settle in estates lately granted to specially favoured children of the R\u00e1o. Most of the country not held by the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s was in the hands of V\u00e1ghela and other Rajput chiefs, who through all changes had kept to their estates, and of smaller proprietors, Miy\u00e1n\u00e1s and others, who had earned grants of free or service land. All J\u00e1deja chiefs and Gir\u00e1sia proprietors acknowledged the R\u00e1o as their head, and when wanted were ready to fight for him.\n\nAs a province of the Moghal Empire, Cutch had, for more than a century and a quarter (1583-1718), been free from attack; and for a hundred years, under the arrangement sanctioned by the Emperor Jah\u00e1ngir, pilgrims had been sent to Mecca free of charge, and Cutch spared the payment of tribute. Soon after Desal\u2019s accession, the Viceroy, pressed for funds in the decay of his Gujar\u00e1t revenue, sent a force into Cutch. This army, under the command of a Path\u00e1n, Mozim Beg, advanced to Padar within ten miles of Bhuj. Hearing of their approach, the R\u00e1o, calling his Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d together, despatched a force to meet the invaders. At the same time he sent agents, representing the injustice of the demand, and reminding the Moghal leader of the terms under which the Cutch tribute had been remitted. These measures were successful, and the Moghal leader, seeing that the R\u00e1o was ready to support remonstrance by force, withdrew. Foreseeing a repetition of the demand, the R\u00e1o set to work to build a fort at Bhuj, and in other ways spared neither expense nor trouble in his efforts to meet a future attack. Nor had he a long respite. In 1721, before three years were over, Naw\u00e1b Kesar Kh\u00e1n came into Cutch, again demanding tribute. Hearing much of the strength of the new fort at Bhuj he avoided it and led his army to, and plundered, Nalia, an open town of considerable wealth in Abd\u00e1s\u00e1. But finding that the people of the country round had taken their goods with them and fled\nto M\u00e1ndvi and Bhuj he withdrew.\\footnote{According to Musalm\u00e1n accounts the Viceroy Haidar Kuli Kh\u00e1n defeated the Cutch chief, and made him pay a sum of \u00a322,500 (6,75,000 mahmudis). Watson's Gujar\u00e1t, 95.} The failure of these two attempts, followed by seven years of peace, lulled the R\u00e1o and his friends into unreadiness. Then the Viceroy, Sarbuland Kh\u00e1n (1723 - 1730), at the head of an army of 50,000 men, and bringing with him K\u00e1nyoji, the Morvi chief, as a claimant to Cutch, advanced towards Bhuj. The R\u00e1o was ill prepared to meet him, and though the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s loyally gathered at Bhuj, they and their followers were little able to oppose so strong an enemy. To add to the R\u00e1o\u2019s difficulties his minister failed him, declaring that he knew of no means for raising money or men. Among the women of his palace, Desal had one favourite wife, whom his bounty had greatly enriched. Telling her his difficulty she freely offered her whole wealth, and her manager, Seth Devkarn a Loh\u00e1na by caste, bowing before the R\u00e1o, engaged, if service were given him, to guide the state safely through its present dangers. The Seth was made minister, and, by his power over his rich caste-fellows, gathered such large sums that, by offers of pay and opium, the whole fighting population of the country was quickly drawn to Bhuj.\n\nEncamping on the borders of the lake outside the city, they were divided into two armies. One was sent to strengthen the garrison of the Bhujia fort, and the other kept to guard the town whose walls were yet unfinished. The day after the defence was arranged, the Musalm\u00e1n army appeared before the city. An attack was made on the Bhujia fort, and two of its bastions were taken. Next day the garrison, in a successful sally, won back the two bastions, and drove out the Musalm\u00e1ns with the loss of their leader the Viceroy\u2019s nephew. Cheered by this success, the R\u00e1o, choosing three thousand of the best J\u00e1deja horse, and binding round their brows the orange turban of self-sacrifice, dashed into the enemy\u2019s camp, and caused such loss and confusion that the invaders retired. At L\u00e1khona, where they halted, their supplies were cut off, and their camp attacked and plundered by troops of Miy\u00e1na horse. Seeing how matters went, their guide K\u00e1nyoji left the Musalm\u00e1ns, and gaining his pardon joined the R\u00e1o. The Viceroy soon after escaped to Gujar\u00e1t, and great numbers of his men following him in disorder were pursued and slain by the Cutch horse.\\footnote{The Muhammadan historians admit, but tone down, this defeat. \u2018The Viceroy now (1730) marched in the direction of Cutch, and refusing the offer of about \u00a333,000 advanced against Bhuj. As the R\u00e1n was very difficult to cross, as the R\u00e1o had cut off supplies, and as news came of riots in Ahmedabad, he had to return to R\u00e1dh\u00e1npur.\u2019 Watson\u2019s Gujar\u00e1t, 106.}\n\nFreed from the risk of foreign invasion the R\u00e1o rewarded Devkarn Seth by giving into his hands the whole management of the country. Knowing his love of wealth, the minister, letting the R\u00e1o\u2019s revenues accumulate, used all his own resources to improve the state. Commerce was encouraged and the land revenue fostered by a useful system of accounts, and by setting agents of the state in every town, and through them supplying the husbandmen with funds.\nBy these means the R\u00e1o's yearly revenue was raised to \u00a350,000 (18 lakhs of koris), and the minister's to more than \u00a325,000 (10 lakhs of koris). Besides enriching the province, Devkarn Seth made it secure against foreign attack, strengthening the Bhuja fort, finishing the walls of the capital, and fortifying the towns of Anj\u00e1r, Mundra, and R\u00e1par. These places were garrisoned by troops, and a regular force engaged to protect the country. Not content with securing the safety of the province, he spread the R\u00e1o's name and power by carrying an army into P\u00e1rkar, and, leaving a post there, overawed the Sodh\u00e1s and put a stop to their raids. In west K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, the Okh\u00e1mandal pirates, who had been harassing the trade of M\u00e1ndvi, were punished and kept in order by building in their district the fort of Cutchigad; and in the east B\u00e1lama and other H\u00e1l\u00e1r villages were recovered from the estate of the traitor K\u00e1nyoji. In Sind, called in by the Raim\u00e1s, Musalm\u00e1ns of the J\u00e1deja stock, Devkarn protected them, and, to secure the lands he had won, built a fort at Rahim-ki-b\u00e1z\u00e1r. All this was done without rousing the ill will of the chiefs and proprietors, who, on the slightest summons were ready to gather round the R\u00e1o's standard.\n\nThe latter part of Desalji's reign was disturbed by the violence and intrigues of his only son L\u00e1kh\u00e1ji. Unlike his father, free-handed and fond of show, L\u00e1kh\u00e1ji was popular, and gathered round him a band of followers who stirred up ill feeling between the young chief and his father. Uneasy as to his designs, the R\u00e1o reduced his son's expenses, and refused him any share of power. L\u00e1kh\u00e1ji left Bhuj, and threatening to take service with the R\u00e1ja of Udepur, forced his father to yield to some of his demands. Though to appearance satisfied, L\u00e1kh\u00e1ji secretly continued to scheme to bring the government into his hand. His first step was to get rid of the minister Devkarn, whom he hated as the cause of his exclusion from a share of power, and whose close intimacy with his mother he is said to have had strong reason for believing to have been criminal. Accordingly, in 1738, he raised a disturbance in front of the minister's house, who, coming out to restore order, was attacked and slain by a hired assassin. At first indignant at the loss of his favourite minister, the R\u00e1o was by degrees won by L\u00e1kh\u00e1ji's submission to grant him forgiveness, and in token of their friendship agreed to be present at an entertainment in L\u00e1kh\u00e1ji's house. The R\u00e1o brought with him most of his chief officers, and to show respect to his father, L\u00e1kh\u00e1ji had all his attendants in waiting. There was much delay in serving the feast, and the young chief, after many impatient messages, himself left the room to hurry on the banquet. As he left every opening from the room was closed, and the R\u00e1o and his officers were quietly secured. Placing his father in confinement, L\u00e1kh\u00e1ji began to rule, receiving the submission of the commandants of all the forts in the province except M\u00e1ndvi. When L\u00e1kha, more commonly called R\u00e1o Lakhtatji, was settled in power, he allowed his father a suitable establishment and greater freedom. And his officers and personal friends were released and sent to distant parts of the country. In 1751, R\u00e1o Desalji died at the age of seventy. Love of money was his ruling passion. But a\nkind and easy temper held him back from cruelty and extortion. Songs still keep fresh the memory of the quiet and plenty of Desalji\u2019s rule when Cutch grew populous and rich, and was respected by its neighbours.\n\nIn 1741, when he placed his father in confinement and assumed the rule of Cutch, Lakhaji was thirty-four years old. His handsome form, pleasing manners, open-handedness, and love of show made him popular, and the great wealth, \u00a31,000,000 (1 kror rupees), found in his father\u2019s treasury did much to strengthen his power. At the same time many of the Jadejas were displeased at Lakhaji\u2019s treatment of his father, and one of them, Sumraji, Thakor of Tera, a rich town and fort in Abdasa, spoke with open scorn of his unnatural conduct. When firmly settled in the government, Lakhaji determined to wipe out this affront. Collecting the Bhayad, he sent a force against Tera, and as the guns were served by men drawn from British territory, the fort suffered severely. After a few days, the chiefs taking thought that on an equally slight pretext the Rao might destroy all their forts, warned the gunners that, if they continued to damage the fort, they should pay for it with their lives. After this the firing caused little injury, and failing to breach the walls, after a three months\u2019 siege, the army withdrew.\n\nOn the accession of the Rao, Devkarn\u2019s son Punja was appointed minister, and so long as he was able to find funds he remained in favour. At the end of five years, by a course of unbounded extravagance, Lakhaji had wasted his father\u2019s treasure, and, finding his income too small for his wants, he dismissed Punja and set a Vania, Rupshi Sha, in his place. One of Rupshi Sha\u2019s first steps was to seize Punja and all his relations, and treat them with such elaborate cruelty that though sixty-five of them died under torture, a sum of \u00a380,000 (30 lakhs of koris) was wrung from the rest.\n\nThe system of fining, first adopted by Rao Lakhaji, soon became the regular practice, and ministers were chosen solely on account of their wealth which soon passed to the Rao. For four years (1746-1750) Rupshi Sha continued in power, and Punja was kept in confinement. Then Rupshi Sha fell into disfavour, and Punja, again in power, retaliated on the Vania, massacring his relations and sparing his life only for prison and the rack. In such disorders affairs soon took another turn, and Punja, driven from power, was succeeded by Gordhan Mehta. Thinking himself ill used, Punja closely allied himself with Godji, the Rao\u2019s only lawful son. Though but sixteen years of age, Godji, following his father\u2019s example and stirred on by his mother and Punja, demanded from his father a share in the management of the state. The Rao refused, and the young chief retired in anger. In his disappointment Punja counselled Godji openly to oppose his father, and the lad and his mother agreed to fly with Punja to Godji\u2019s town of Mundra. Before leaving Bhuj, Punja managed to ruin his rival Gordhan Mehta. On the day of his flight, to prevent suspicion, he sent a message to the minister asking for a\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 109.\nprivate interview. That it might afterwards seem that he and Gordhan had together planned some treachery, he went to Gordhan's house with much show of mystery, drew public attention to his visit, and for two hours, with closed doors and windows, contrived to amuse Gordhan with trifling conversation. Shortly after, the R\u00e1o was told that his son and wife had fled with Punja. And hearing that a few hours before his flight Punja had a long and secret meeting with Gordhan, he was highly enraged, and ordered Gordhan's instant execution. On Gordhan's death Rupshi Sha was freed and restored to power. He continued minister for a year and a half, when, on his return from C\u00e1bul, the post was given to Tulshid\u00e1s, a favourite of the R\u00e1o's.\n\nMeanwhile, Godji was living in Mundra independent of his father. Though chiefly advised by Punja, he trusted much to one Mirza Amir Beg, a man of bad character, whom he made his Jam\u00e1d\u00e1r. About this time, a certain Sh\u00e1h M\u00e1danji, a very rich merchant, died in Mundra, and to his funeral ceremonies some of the wealthiest men in Cutch came. Acting on his Jam\u00e1d\u00e1r's advice, Godji, who was badly off for funds, shut the city gates and refused to let the merchants go till they paid large sums of money. Enraged at his son's conduct, L\u00e1kha sent a force against Mundra. Godji fled to Morvi, and being supplied with troops, came back, drove off the attacking force, and relieved the town. The R\u00e1o at length compromised with his son allowing him to keep Mundra on condition that he would dismiss Punja. To this Godji agreed, and in 1758 Punja retired to Moth\u00e1l\u00e1 in Abd\u00e1s\u00e1, on a monthly pension of about \u00a325 (1000 koris). About this time (1757) the R\u00e1o presented the Emperor \u00c1lamgir II. (1754-1759) with some Cutch horses and Gujar\u00e1t bullocks, and in return received, the title of Mirza.\u00b9 In the following year he planned an expedition against Tatta and was promised help both by the Peshwa and the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r. No active steps would seem to have been taken.\u00b2 He had become extremely weakened by constant debauchery, never rising from his couch before four o'clock in the afternoon. The affairs of the Government were entrusted to a succession of incapable ministers whose one qualification was a willing assent to every plan, however disreputable, which could contribute to the R\u00e1o's profligate habits. Scenes of cruelty and oppression, previously unknown in Cutch, were common, and as the court lost character, its influence in Sind and P\u00e1rkar declined, and in 1760 the posts at Vir\u00e1v\u00e1h and P\u00e1rkar were driven out.\n\nThough the wealth of the country was squandered, its finances were flourishing. Lakhpat alone, from the cultivation of rice, yielded a yearly revenue of about \u00a320,000 (8 lakhs of koris). The province was at peace with its neighbours, and the only internal disturbance, due to some encroachments on the part of the Dhamarka chief, ended in the R\u00e1o's favour, and in the capture and destruction of the Th\u00e1k\u00f3r's\n\n\u00b9 Watson's Gujar\u00e1t, 148. Mr. Burgess (Arch. Sur. Rep. 1874-75, 200) says the title of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1o Shri and the M\u00e1hi Mar\u00e1thib.\n\u00b2 Watson's Gujar\u00e1t, 149.\ntown. In 1760 L\u00e1kha, who had been suffering from leprosy and other diseases, died at the age of fifty-four. On his death-bed he tried to induce the officers of his troops to appoint one of his six illegitimate sons. They refused, and sending word to Godji, he came and succeeded without opposition. L\u00e1kha was the first of the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s to establish the form and state of a Darb\u00e1r or court at Bhuj, and, being a man of considerable intelligence, treated foreigners with much liberality, and from them picked up a large store of information about other countries. He enlarged and embellished the palace with foreign ornaments, many of them of European workmanship. The taste for European articles sprang from his acquaintance with an adventurer named R\u00e1msing M\u00e1lam, who had made several voyages to Europe, and who accidentally visited Bhuj. R\u00e1msing was a man of very high mechanical talent. Taken into the service of the R\u00e1o, he established a cannon foundry and silk and glass manufactures, made clocks, and minutely copied patterns of European models and figures. So well did he teach, that the mechanical skill for which Cutch craftsmen are now famous is generally traced to his training. To reward these services, the R\u00e1o presented him with the village of Kaly\u00e1npur, and till his death he continued to live at Bhuj in wealth and comfort.\n\nOn reaching Bhuj a few hours after his father\u2019s death, Godji found the Darb\u00e1r officers ready to acknowledge him, and without opposition he began to rule at the age of twenty-six. He continued as minister a Loh\u00e1na named Jivan Seth, who had held the post during the last years of his father\u2019s reign. This choice led to long years of trouble. Punja, his old minister and supporter, hearing of Godji\u2019s accession, hurried from his retirement in Jun\u00e1gad, confident of meeting the reward of his former services. But before he had time to reach Bhuj, Jivan had persuaded the R\u00e1o that if Punja came he should be told to leave without tasting the water of the town. Meeting with this rebuff, Punja retired to Kanthkot. But as his reception gave offence at Bhuj, the chief asked him to seek shelter elsewhere. He then went to J\u00e1tav\u00e1da, and here too he was pursued; and, only by the kindness of his host, escaped a troop of cavalry sent to seize him. From J\u00e1tav\u00e1da he retired to Vir\u00e1w\u00e1h in P\u00e1rkar whose chief, in return for former favours, was friendly.\n\nGhul\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h Kalhora, then reigning in Sind, had long looked for a chance of meddling in Cutch affairs. This was not unknown to Punja, and was probably one of his reasons for retreating to P\u00e1rkar. With Gidomal the Sind minister, a man of his own caste, Punja opened a correspondence. Hearing of this, Ghul\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h lost no time in asking Punja to Haidarabad; sent him \u00a31500 (1000 mohars) for his expenses and a palanquin with an escort of 100 men; and on his arrival received him with every honour. The Amir explained his wish to conquer Cutch, and gain the R\u00e1o\u2019s sister in marriage. To the idea of conquering Cutch, Punja gave little.\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 96.\nencouragement, but he strongly recommended the marriage, representing at the same time that the proposal would be entertained only if Ghul\u00e1m appeared before Bhuj at the head of a victorious army. Meanwhile the R\u00e1o, not unaware of the combination against him, directed Jivan to summon the Abd\u00e1s\u00e1 and V\u00e1gad Gir\u00e1s\u00edas to defend the country. The whole Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d, except the Moth\u00e1la chief who was friendly to Punja, readily answered the summons, and took the field under the minister. Godji remained in command at Bhuj which he garrisoned with 1000 men from Nav\u00e1nagar and a body of R\u00e1dhanpur troops. Ghul\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h and Punja, at the head of the Sindian army, quitted Haidarabad accompanied by an immense body of followers, who, it is said, raised the strength of the expedition to about 70,000 men. Crossing the Ran, the Sindians, after a heavy march of twenty-seven miles, found Nara deserted, and the wells filled with stones. So great was their distress from thirst and fatigue, that had Jivan marched against them, they would have fallen an easy prey. But the minister was no general, and, quietly encamping in a strong position close by on the J\u00e1ra hills, allowed the Sind troops to refresh themselves. After two days' rest Ghul\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h marched to J\u00e1ra and attacked the hill. The approach was defended by a large gun round which the Cutch army were gathered. At the first shot the gun burst doing much injury and causing great confusion in the Cutch ranks. Taking advantage of the disorder, the Sindians climbed the hill sword in hand, and destroyed almost the whole army, leaving among the slain Jivan the minister, three sons of the Th\u00e1kor of Nara, and many other leading chiefs. According to Cutch accounts their total loss was not less than a hundred thousand slain. From J\u00e1ra, Ghul\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, marching to Tera, levied a heavy fine, and plundered and burned the country. Learning of this crushing defeat, the R\u00e1o, sending a private agent to Punja, confessed his unjust conduct, stated that he had been deceived by Jivan, and entreating Punja to arrange that the Sindian army should be withdrawn, invited him as his minister to Bhuj, and promised to ratify any agreement he should make with Ghul\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h. His return to favour at Bhuj secured, Punja was not less anxious than the R\u00e1o to get rid of the Sindian army. To arrange this without losing credit with Ghul\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h seemed well nigh hopeless. But affairs took a turn that made his part easier to play. News that the wells on the straight road to Bhuj had been poisoned led Ghul\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h to advance by a longer route. As he went, he succeeded in levying sums of money from several chiefs. But a force sent against S\u00e1ndh\u00e1n was repulsed. When the news of this check reached Ghul\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, Punja was with him. Affecting a keen alarm, he warned Ghul\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h that there were 360 forts each as strong as S\u00e1ndh\u00e1n, and that Bhuj itself was guarded by the choicest troops of Nav\u00e1nagar and R\u00e1dhanpur. So far, he urged, Ghul\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h's success was complete, and he engaged that if Ghul\u00e1m withdrew, he would go to Bhuj and arrange the marriage with the R\u00e1o's sister. To this Ghul\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h agreed, and, taking with him Punja's son as a hostage, retired to Sind. On reaching Bhuj the R\u00e1o received Punja with every sign of respect, and at once made him minister. After fulfilling his preliminary agreement with Ghul\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, Punja's\nfirst measure was, partly by firmness and partly by paying their arrears, to dismiss the R\u00e1dhanpur army which held the gates, and in defiance of Godji showed every wish to remain masters at Bhuj. During the next two years Punja was occupied in an expedition into V\u00e1gad where he levied a fine on Kanthkot and the chiefs of the district. All this time, though Punja never ceased urging him, the R\u00e1o had failed to give his sister in marriage to Ghul\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h. From this constant subject of dispute, and perhaps from the manner in which he had regained his post, the R\u00e1o was never well disposed to Punja; and, when he had repaired his forts, raised a militia, and established his power, he determined to rid himself of his minister. By his order Punja was seized, confined in irons for ten days, and, by the R\u00e1o himself, was presented with a cup of poison. On hearing of Punja\u2019s murder, Ghul\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h gathered another army of 50,000 men, and re-entered Cutch by the Nara route. Nara he again found deserted, and except at the small fort of Muru, where a Rajput garrison of eighty men resisted and were all massacred, he advanced unopposed within sight of Bhuj. Encamping at Rodar M\u00e1ta within five miles of the town, he despatched his minister, Gidomal, with some men of distinction to demand, as had before been promised, the R\u00e1o\u2019s sister in marriage. Godji, well supplied with troops and resources, received the envoys with little courtesy, and refused to give any satisfactory answer. During the night the envoys passed in Bhuj, the R\u00e1o ordered that, at the same moment, every gun in the city should be fired. This caused the strangers such alarm that they took back with them the most exaggerated accounts of the height of the walls and the strength of the town. After a few days skirmishing, Ghul\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h was induced to listen to a compromise, by which, instead of the R\u00e1o\u2019s sister, he received in marriage the daughter of the chief of Kh\u00e1khar, a near kinsman of the R\u00e1o. After remaining for some time inactive he recrossed the Ran, leaving at Lakhpat a post of 5000 men. About this time by building at Ali Bandar a bank across the Kori mouth of the Indus, Ghul\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h stopped the source from which the great rice-lands of Lakhpat drew their water supply; and the rice tract gradually became a salt waste like the rest of the Ran, leaving the Cutch state poorer by a yearly sum of about \u00a320,000 (8 lakhs of koris). In 1772, seven years after his return to Sind, Ghul\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h died, and was succeeded by his son Sarfar\u00e1z. This prince was soon involved in troubles at his own court, and was obliged to withdraw his outpost from Lakhpat. At the same time he allowed Devji, the son of Punja, to leave his court and return to Bhuj. Devji was well received by the R\u00e1o, and offered employment. But warned by the fate of his father and grandfather, he asked leave to retire and re-people Lakhpat. This was granted, and from the respect in which his family was held, he succeeded so well that the R\u00e1o, having the highest opinion of his abilities, anxious to get him as minister, ordered him to Bhuj. He started for the capital, but, on his way, was poisoned by some of the Darb\u00e1r people who dreaded his influence.\n\nDuring this time the affairs of the state had fallen into confusion and disrepute. After Punja\u2019s death a succession of ministers\nfollowed, most of whom were murdered and their property seized by the R\u00e1o. During these changes the R\u00e1o, without a struggle, lost B\u00e1lamba in K\u00e1thi\u00e1war. Godji, naturally of a suspicious temper, had for some time entertained a continued dread of assassination. This fear led him to collect a small body of Sid\u00eds who continued to increase in number till all the power of the Darb\u00e1r rested with them. So overbearing were they that, at last, the ladies and principal officers of the palace, to free the R\u00e1o from their power, seized his person and kept him in confinement till the whole body of Sid\u00eds, more than 400 in all, were driven from Cutch. Enraged at this insult Godji retired in disgust to M\u00e1ndvi where he stayed building a palace and paying no heed to public affairs. About 1775, Miy\u00e1n Sarfar\u00e1z Kh\u00e1n (1772-1777), Ghul\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h\u2019s son, the Kalh\u00f3r ruler of Haidarabad in Sind, entering Cutch, took the route of Kh\u00e1vda and Sumr\u00e1sar, intending to march to Bhuj, but the accounts of its strength frightened him, and leading the army to Chob\u00e1ri and Kanthkot, he married the daughter of the Th\u00e1k\u00f3r, and levying fines at Adhoi and other places returned to Sind. At this time (1776-1786), in Sind, the struggles between the Kalh\u00f3ras and T\u00e1lpur\u00e1s divided the country into two factions. Abdul Nabb\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, who succeeded in 1777, had appointed Mir Bijr his minister. On Mir Bijr\u2019s elevation to power, two Beluchis, who had assassinated his father, sought refuge in Cutch, and, as the R\u00e1o refused to give them up, the province was again invaded and much of Abd\u00e1sa plundered and laid waste. The R\u00e1o\u2019s mercenaries, at this time a very formidable body, sent under the command of one Mirza Kurpa Beg against the Sind army, fell in with a detachment of it and cut it to pieces, and the people of the country aiding the R\u00e1o\u2019s troops, the invaders were forced to retreat across the Ran with considerable loss and disgrace. Elated by his success, Mirza Kurpa Beg, upon his return to Bhuj, threw off all subjection to the R\u00e1o and began to act with great insolence, especially towards the two Sind refugees. Complaining to the R\u00e1o, the refugees were encouraged, if the chance offered, to assassinate Mirza Beg. Not many days after the Mirza sent for them and being refused a sum of money, ordered their wives and children to be sold. Enraged at this insult the Beluchis attacked him and slew him on the spot. For this deed of valour the R\u00e1o rewarded them with handsome grants of land. Soon after this Godji sickened, it was said of dropsy, and died at the age of forty-four. He left two sons, R\u00e1yadhan who succeeded and Prithhir\u00e1j. He had married one of his sisters to D\u00e1m\u00e1ji Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r of Baroda.\n\nSmall and mean in person, of a jealous and cruel temper, oppressive and unscrupulous, Godji is, among the people of Cutch, the most unpopular of their rulers. Frugal in private life, he kept an establishment of elephants and horses far beyond his means, and in spite of the many large fortunes he seized and turned to his own use, he died leaving an empty treasury. In spite of Godji\u2019s mismanagement and\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. (New Series), 101. Barton (Sind, 22) gives 1778, and the Sind Gazetteer (34), 1782.\n2 Besides poisoning or assassinating twenty ministers, Godji in a fit of jealousy killed his own brother.\nthe number of invasions from which it had suffered, Cutch had not, except in Lakhpat, materially fallen off either in people or tillage, and during the latter years of Godji's rule and the early years of his successor's was able to supply Sind with grain.\n\nR\u00e1o R\u00e1yadhan, who had passed all his boyhood with the women of the palace, succeeded his father, in 1778, at the early age of fifteen. Inheriting unlimited power at so early an age, and surrounded by attendants sullied and debased by constant scenes of bloodshed and cruelty, he was exposed to the worst advice and example. The country was most disturbed. The late war with Sind, carried on without ability or honesty, had exhausted the revenues, and so slack was the management, that some of the chiefs and other proprietors were subject to the R\u00e1o only in name, and crime was so little repressed, that there was security neither of person nor property.\n\nIn one respect the young R\u00e1o was fortunate. His mother's influence secured the appointment of minister to Devchand, a much respected Loh\u00e1na, who during the last reign had more than once managed the affairs of the state. Too upright to serve the late R\u00e1o's purposes, had he not on all occasions enjoyed the protecting influence of R\u00e1yadhan's mother he might have shared the fate of most of Godji's ministers. For a short time under Devchand's management things went well. But before long a plot was formed against him. One evening on reaching the palace he was arrested by the commander of the R\u00e1o's body-guard, and, shortly after, his three brothers, who held Anj\u00e1r, Mundra, and R\u00e1par, were seized and brought to Bhuj, where the whole family, including Devchand were put to death, and a large fine levied on their relations. Shortly after this, by the death of the R\u00e1o's mother, the cause of order in Cutch suffered another heavy loss. The young chief, who had hitherto shown no special fondness for vice, gave himself up to debauchery, and disorder became general over the province. The district managers thought themselves more safe in open hostility to the R\u00e1o than in his service; and by degrees the outlying parts of the province were alienated from the central authority at Bhuj.\n\nAfter Devchand's death the R\u00e1o fell into the hands of Sidi Merich, the oppressive governor of Bhuj. Finding himself unable to control them, Sidi Merich chose as minister of the provinces V\u00e1gha P\u00e1rekh, a V\u00e1nia by caste, who, greedy and overbearing, attacked the J\u00e1deja\n\n---\n\n1 Bom.

One that they were the work of the mercenaries, done without the knowledge of the R\u00e1o and before he had begun to show signs of vice. The other that they were carried out by the R\u00e1o's order, acting on an injunction left him by his father that the relations between the queen and the minister were criminal, and that the R\u00e1o's disgrace must be wiped out by the destruction of the minister and his family. Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 14, 114.\nchief of P\u00e1tri and slaying him took his fort. This severity gave great offence, and Sidi Merich seeing that V\u00e1gha P\u00e1rekh's conduct made himself unpopular tried to assassinate him. The attempt failed, and V\u00e1gha winning over the nobles and the ladies of the palace procured the banishment of the whole body of Sidi mercenaries. But V\u00e1gha's success was shortlived. One of the Sid\u00eds, Masud by name, who, as a personal favourite of the R\u00e1o's was allowed to remain, before long succeeded in bringing about his imprisonment and death.\n\nAbout this time (1783) the R\u00e1ja of Jodhpur, at the head of an army, passed through Cutch on his way to Sind to restore Abdul Nabbi Kh\u00e1n, who had been driven from his kingdom by the T\u00e1lpur\u00e1s. The R\u00e1ja tried to persuade the R\u00e1o to help him. But affairs at Bhuj were in too great disorder to allow of ready aid, and, before anything could be done, the Jodhpur army, after a contest with Mir Fateh Ali at Chob\u00e1ri, were forced to retire in disorder. In the following year (1784), when twenty years of age, R\u00e1yadhan began to show signs of madness. At first he did little harm, his chief peculiarity being an extreme zeal for the Musalm\u00e1n faith, which he is said to have learned from a Muhammadan beggar Muhammad Syed. Afterwards he became more violent, attacked and imprisoned Hindus, and, wandering with a band of followers through the streets of Bhuj, wounded or killed all who refused to profess Isl\u00e1m. By these and other outrages, R\u00e1yadhan so clearly showed himself mad, that his family and minister determined to take steps to place him under restraint. But R\u00e1yadhan, known as the Pehlv\u00e1n or athlete, was a man of great personal strength and courage, and as he was always surrounded by a band of trusty Path\u00e1ns, it was no easy matter to seize him. V\u00e1gha P\u00e1rekh the minister, suddenly brought a body of troops from Anj\u00e1r into the courtyard of the Bhuj palace. Getting timely news of their arrival, the R\u00e1o, sending word to his body-guard, escaped to the top of the palace, and cutting away the stair gave his Path\u00e1ns time to assemble and come to his rescue. With their help the whole body of the assailants was destroyed. Though successful for the moment, the R\u00e1o's conduct had estranged all his servants, and from this time his authority was no longer acknowledged. M\u00e1ndvi under R\u00e1m\u00ed Khav\u00e1s, Anj\u00e1r under Meghji Seth, and Mundra, Lakhat, and several other towns under other leaders became independent. The Miy\u00e1n\u00e1s, gathering in large\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 14 and 114,115.

Two years later (1785), and again in 1789 Mir Fateh Ali with his brothers, wives, and attendants had to take refuge in Cutch. Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 115.\n3 Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 117. According to another story the people from Anj\u00e1r asked to have an interview, and the R\u00e1o suspecting that they meant to seize him, summoned them to a reception room in the upper story of the palace. Himself retiring to the roof, he gave orders that the stair, little more than a ladder, up which the Anj\u00e1r men had come, should be taken away. Caught in this trap he destroyed the deputation by throwing large quantities of gunpowder into the room. Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 14.\nbodies, entrenched themselves at Baliari, and, sallying out, plundered on every side. So great was the disorder that the people leaving their homes fled for safety to the towns.\n\nMeanwhile at Bhuj things went from bad to worse. The Rao, in want of funds, laid hands on the wealth amassed by his favourites Muhammad Syed and Sidi Masud, and banished them both from Bhuj. Soon after this Meghji Seth of Anjar seized the palace gates, and the Rao, forced to submit, was placed under restraint (1786). The confinement of Rayadhan was a relief to the whole country. The chief actors, the Jamadars and Meghji Seth, raising Prithiraj or Bhaiji Bava, Rayadhan's younger brother to the chiefship, appointed during his minority a council known as the Bara Bhai with Meghji Seth and Dosal Ven as its leading members. This Government was at first successful, restoring order and bringing the chief of Mandvi and others to acknowledge and pay tribute to the central authority. Before long the council disagreed, and Meghji Seth, convicted of an attempt to poison some of the members, was forced to flee. Seeking shelter in his old province of Anjar he established himself there as an almost independent ruler. To his party belonged the chief of Mandvi and Aima Bai, the mother of the Rao Bhaiji Bava, and by their secession, the power of Dosal Ven and the other members of the council was greatly reduced. To add to the confusion two members of the council freed Rao Rayadhan from restraint. The rest left Bhuj, and, in the disorders that followed, Fateh Muhammad, a subordinate officer rose to favour. But the Rao was in no fit state to be free and one day attacking Fateh Muhammad, that officer had to fly for his life. Strengthening himself in one of the towers of the city wall he resisted the Rao's attacks, and with the help of Dosal Ven, defeated the Rao and again placed him under restraint.\n\nThis Fateh Muhammad, a Notiar Musalm\u00e1n of Sind descent, of great personal strength, endurance and courage, of much tact and patience, and, though illiterate, of strong personal influence, was, as the chief actor in this second revolution, admitted a member of Bhaiji Bava's council. For a year matters went quietly. But Dosal Ven, the head of the council, a man of hasty and violent temper, too sure of his position, neither took pains to treat the Rao with respect nor to win the regard of the Jadeja chiefs. Taking advantage of Dosal Ven's want of popularity, Fateh Muhammad withdrew for a time from Bhuj, and, finding that the Jadeja chiefs were annoyed with Dosal Ven's treatment of the Rao, he in Dosal's absence came back to Bhuj. Always a favourite with the troops, Fateh Muhammad had little difficulty in putting an end to Dosal's supremacy and restoring Bhaiji Bava to his proper position as the head of the state.\n\nAs minister, Fateh Muhammad showed great prudence and judgment. Acting towards him with the most careful respect and attention and upon the most trifling occasions submitting his plans for\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 117.\n2 Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 118.\n3 Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 120.\n4 Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 121.\napproval, he won the regard of the young R\u00e1o; he secured the favour of the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s by pensions; and, by raising a powerful body of mercenaries, acted with such vigour against those who opposed him, that except Dosal Ven, who retired to Mundra, all the members of the council were either banished from Cutch, or placed in confinement.\n\nHe next turned his attention to the outlying parts of the province, which during the eight years of weak and divided rule had fallen into disorder and become a prey to the raids of Miy\u00e1na and Khosa robbers. V\u00e1gad was brought under order and made to pay revenue. The town of S\u00e1nta, whose unruly chief had refused to pay tribute, was taken and plundered, and its bands of robbers broken and driven out of the country. After V\u00e1gad had been brought under order, only two towns resisted the R\u00e1o\u2019s authority. One of these, Mundra in which Dosal Ven had settled, was attacked and surrendered, Dosal Ven withdrawing with a pension to Betta in Abd\u00e1sa. As M\u00e1ndvi, the only remaining town, was too strong to be taken by assault, Fateh Muhammad made ready a fleet of boats and seized its rich trading vessels. Disgusted with their loss, the M\u00e1ndvi merchants determined to quit M\u00e1ndvi, whose ruler gave them no protection. Anticipating this result, Fateh Muhammad came to meet them, and receiving them with great kindness, restored their property. In return for this generous treatment the merchants went back to M\u00e1ndvi, bought over the garrison, and delivered the place into Fateh Muhammad\u2019s hands. Besides in bringing disorderly vassals to obedience, Fateh Muhammad spread the R\u00e1o\u2019s power by recovering arrears of tribute from the J\u00e1m of Nav\u00e1nagar, and obtained from the Gir\u00e1s\u00edas the cession of the Bhach\u00e1 district in V\u00e1gad, which under his strong and careful management became one of the richest and most populous parts of Cutch. One of his projects of improvement was to make Lakhpat a great port. A fort was built and the place prospered, its revenue doubling in a few years. With the establishment of order he introduced a system of strict and fair government long unknown in Cutch. To each district he appointed a manager, and forced them to treat the people with great consideration. At the same time, so long as they had his confidence, he placed in their hands almost unlimited power, neither listening to stories against them nor cramping them by requiring too close an adherence to rules. He thus roused an enthusiasm among his dependents who carried out his orders with a spirit and trust that ensured success. His example was worthy of his precepts. Though the number of his mercenaries was much increased, he, seldom in passing through the country, allowed one of his men to enter a village. The headmen had beforehand orders for supplies, and the greatest care was taken to prevent irregularities. During those years, Cutch, favoured with fruitful seasons, recovered from its misrule, and probably at no time was its trade or its revenue more flourishing.\n\nProsperity lasted till Bh\u00e1ji B\u00e1va, arrived at mature age, began to view with jealousy his minister\u2019s almost absolute power. The first open rupture was in 1801 at a pleasure party, on the\nBhuj lake. Bh\u00e1\u00edji had been drinking, and on some trifling difference of opinion, he not only accused Fateh Muhammad of rebellious intentions, but would have attacked him had he not been held back. Afterwards there was a show of reconciliation, but Bh\u00e1\u00edji had lost trust in Fateh Muhammad, and only waited a favourable opportunity of separating from him. Matters came to a crisis, when, shortly after, the young R\u00e1o asked for and was refused the revenues of the town of M\u00e1ndvi. With his friends he now planned an escape from Bhuj, and on a day when Fateh Muhammad was absent at Lakhpat, the officer in charge of Bhach\u00e1u sent troops to escort the R\u00e1o to M\u00e1ndvi, where Hansr\u00e1j, the commandant of the town, received him, declared in his favour, and drove out the militia that continued true to Fateh Muhammad's interests. On reaching Lakhpat, Fateh Muhammad heard of the R\u00e1o's flight and turning back with all speed collected his forces at Bhuj. Under \u00c1skarn Seth he sent a detachment to the Machhu K\u00e1ntha to prevent the arrival of troops from the Morvi chief. This body of men did good service, attacking and defeating a formidable force coming to the R\u00e1o's assistance from R\u00e1dhanpur, and then at P\u00e1tri, on the way to M\u00e1ndvi, defeating a detachment sent against them by Hansr\u00e1j. While thus successful, they were suddenly recalled to Bhuj, where Fateh Muhammad, deserted by one of his chief supporters the commandant of Lakhpat, and badly off for funds, had determined to centre his forces. The R\u00e1o now moved against Bhuj, and being joined by many bands of mercenaries, became so strong that Fateh Muhammad feeling resistance useless, agreed to surrender the capital, if he were given the estates of Anj\u00e1r and Bhach\u00e1u. Accepting these terms Bh\u00e1\u00edji and Hansr\u00e1j took possession of Bhuj. Before leaving Bhuj, Fateh Muhammad set free the insane R\u00e1o R\u00e1yadhan, a step which greatly embarrassed the new government. R\u00e1o R\u00e1yadhan was at first most grateful to them for his freedom, and at last, with much trouble was pacified by a daily grant of about \u00a38 (300 koris). After this the place of minister became a matter of keen dispute, and Muhammad Miy\u00e1n, passed over in favour of Hansr\u00e1j, was so displeased that he retired to Mundra. Scarcely were these troubles settled, when Bh\u00e1\u00edji died at the early age of twenty-seven.\n\nR\u00e1o R\u00e1yadhan, who had so far submitted chiefly from respect to his brother, now insisted on resuming his authority. He became perfectly unmanageable and sallied from the palace to kill Hansr\u00e1j, who saved his life by a speedy retreat to M\u00e1ndvi. R\u00e1yadhan was at last independent. But he had no funds, and before long, was forced to call Hansr\u00e1j to his help. Hansr\u00e1j came, and succeeding in placing R\u00e1yadhan under restraint, carried on the government at Bhuj. About this time (1802), he offered to cede Cutch to the British Government on condition that they would grant a maintenance to R\u00e1o R\u00e1yadhan and his relations. Meanwhile Fateh Muhammad, remaining quiet at Anj\u00e1r, busied himself in extending its trade and establishing a harbour at Tuna. In these schemes\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Sel., XV. 125.  \n2 Sir John Malcolm's Minute (June 1830).\nand in keeping up a large body of mercenaries he spent more than his income, and looking about for some way to raise money, made so heavy a demand from his follower \u00c1skarn, that he, entering into secret communication with Hansr\u00e1j, invited him to attack Anj\u00e1r, and flying from the town joined his troops. They advanced together against Anj\u00e1r; but after remaining some days before the town, were forced to return to Bhuj. Shortly afterwards, at Bhuj, \u00c1skarn taking advantage of Hansr\u00e1j's absence, on condition of a promise of the post of minister, set R\u00e1o R\u00e1yadhan free. But none of the districts would admit \u00c1skarn's authority or pay him revenue, and failing in another attack on Anj\u00e1r he had again to fly to Bhuj. Here so cruel were his exactions, that the people rose against him, and the R\u00e1o, hearing their complaints, ordered him to be seized and put to death. \u00c1skarn saved his life by taking shelter in Muhammad Pana's mosque and afterwards escaped with only two horsemen.\n\nFateh Muhammad, after his victory over \u00c1skarn, continued to advance on Bhuj, and, finding the mercenaries friendly, he was at night secretly admitted into the town. His troops had scarcely entered when they were attacked by R\u00e1yadhan, who had always a strong dislike to Fateh Muhammad, and was now determined to dispute his possession of Bhuj. In this irregular fight, R\u00e1o R\u00e1yadhan, wounded in the foot by a musket ball, was caught and placed under restraint. This injury to the sacred person of the R\u00e1o was much resented by the people, and in spite of his efforts to explain it and apologise, the accident greatly lessened Fateh Muhammad's popularity.\u00b9\n\nFateh Muhammad was now (1804) once more in power. His views and character were much changed. Soured by misfortune he had grown suspicious and cruel, and his future conduct was guided neither by justice nor moderation. Finding that he could place no trust in the Cutch militia he gradually disbanded them, and in their stead brought in foreigners from Sind and the neighbouring provinces. As ambitious as ever he determined to bring the whole of Cutch into his power. Those who yielded were plundered and ill-used; those who resisted were pursued with the keenest vengeance. Between 1804 and 1808 he four times advanced against Lakhpat, but on each occasion had to retire defeated. His efforts against M\u00e1ndvi, where Hansr\u00e1j was now settled, were attended with little better success.\u00b2 For a time Hansr\u00e1j was forced to pay. But some excuse for refusing was always ready, and in the fight between the two rivals the whole country round was laid waste. Short of funds, Fateh Muhammad added to his revenue by levying fines and forced contributions. The whole of the Miy\u00e1n\u00e1s' villages were taxed, and even towns granted in religious gift did not escape. One of these exactions nearly cost Fateh Muhammad his life. Gajoji, a local chief, agreed, on promise of a share in the plunder, to help Fateh Muhammad to recover a heavy fine from the village of Pasura. The fine was levied, but the chief was paid no\n\n\u00b9 Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 128. \u00b2 Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 129.\nshare of it, and at last, weary with waiting, he in open court, attacked Fateh Muhammad, and, before he was cut down, gave him a very serious sword wound.\\footnote{As a punishment for Gagoji's conduct the estates of his family were seized and have since formed part of the R\u00e1o's possessions.}\n\nOn recovering from his wound, Fateh Muhammad, at the instigation of the chief of \u00c1desar, marched into eastern Cutch and remained in V\u00e1gad during the greater part of this and the two following years (1809-1812). While here, he raised large sums by fines and exactions, driving people from the Gir\u00e1sia towns and villages and forcing them to settle in a newly founded town which he named Fatehgad. In spite of Fateh Muhammad's efforts there was little order or security in Cutch. The east was overrun by banditti, who, passing across the Ran, caused disturbance and loss in K\u00e1thi\u00e1war, and the sea was covered by pirates helped, it was believed, by persons in M\u00e1ndvi who shared in the spoils. Under these circumstances, the rulers of Cutch, who had before sought their aid, again turned for help to the British Government, asking them to send a force into Cutch and bring the country into order. But the British Government was unwilling to side with either party, and the work of establishing the R\u00e1c in power seemed more than they were called on to undertake. In their opinion, their two chief objects were to prevent raids from Cutch into K\u00e1thi\u00e1war and to put down piracy, and these could best be secured by mediation. Accordingly two separate agreements were made, one on the 26th October 1809, with Fateh Muhammad Vazir to His Highness the R\u00e1c, providing that no troops should be allowed to cross to the south shore of the gulf of Cutch; that the claims on the J\u00e1m of Nav\u00e1nagar should be settled by arbitration; that piracy should cease; and that no European or American power should be allowed to settle in Cutch.\n\nAbout the same time (28th October and 12th November 1809) engagements were passed by Hansr\u00e1j as Diw\u00e1n of His Highness the R\u00e1c. Of these the first was the same as that passed by Fateh Muhammad. The second provided that an English agent, with a guard of forty men, should be stationed at M\u00e1ndvi, the cost being met by a yearly payment of \u00a31800 (Rs. 18,000), and that in the event of any enemy attacking M\u00e1ndvi, the British Government should, on certain terms, supply troops for its defence.\\footnote{Aitchison's Treaties (1876), IV, 11-13.} Very shortly after entering into this agreement, before the close of 1809, Hansr\u00e1j died.\\footnote{Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 130.}\n\nThe most successful of Fateh Muhammad's rivals, Hansr\u00e1j owed his success not so much to strength as to moderation. Under his rule the rich traders of M\u00e1ndvi felt so strongly their freedom from fines and exactions, that more than once they opposed a reconciliation between Hansr\u00e1j and Fateh Muhammad, fearing that, if M\u00e1ndvi came into his hands, Fateh Muhammad would torture them with contributions and levies. Hansr\u00e1j was succeeded by his brother Tokarsi, and Fateh Muhammad, thinking that a good time had come for taking the city, attacked it but with no better success than before.\nDuring the next two years (1810-1812) Fateh Muhammad's chief care was to raise the revenue. Over the whole province a large body of militia was spread, and much force and oppression were used. His power now more widely established than ever, Fateh Muhammad formed the design of making all the chiefs pay tribute to the R\u00e1o. Nor was he content with Cutch. He planned to drive the English out of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r and bring the whole of Gujar\u00e1t under his rule. On one occasion he crossed with his army to K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r determined to settle by arms his disputes with Nav\u00e1nagar. But at Hari\u00e1na he was met by an English agent and, on being warned that Colonel Walker was close by with a body of British troops, retired to Cutch. In 1812 the British were again forced to interfere. Contrary to their agreements of 1809, neither of the Cutch authorities had taken any steps to put down piracy. Shivr\u00e1j, Hansr\u00e1j's son, allowed it to go on unchecked, and Fateh Muhammad encouraged it protecting Husain N\u00e1kwa a notorious robber. In consequence of this, towards the end of 1812, a British officer, Lieutenant MacMurdo, was sent to M\u00e1ndvi, with instructions to visit all the Cutch ports towards Sind, as well as the Sind ports of Sihra and Kurrachee and to deliver letters to Fateh Muhammad and Shivr\u00e1j, warning them, that if piracy was not put down and British subjects repaid their losses, serious steps would be taken.\n\nIn February 1813, Lieutenant MacMurdo reached M\u00e1ndvi, and in person delivered the letter to Shivr\u00e1j, forwarding Fateh Muhammad's to Bhuj. The M\u00e1ndvi authorities agreed to make good losses suffered from pirates. But on his return on the 31st March, after a visit to the Sind ports, MacMurdo found that a piracy had been committed, and no steps taken to seize the offender, or make good the loss. At the same time the V\u00e1gad banditti were causing much mischief in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r and an outpost of Cutch troops was stationed at S\u00e1ntalpur on the south shore of the gulf. By these acts Fateh Muhammad showed how little he was inclined to carry out the terms of his engagements with the British. Twice in the course of the year, in April (12th) and a few months later, strong letters of remonstrance were addressed to him. They had little effect. The banditti were allowed to roam unchecked and the Cutch authorities still meddled in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r affairs. A few months later (August) a final letter was sent, telling Fateh Muhammad that, unless he at once took measures to put a stop to the robberies by land and by sea, friendly relations between the Company and the Cutch state must cease. Captain MacMurdo was directed to proceed to Morvi on the south of the Ran and wait Fateh Muhammad's reply.\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 130.\n2 Sir John Malcolm's Minute (June 1830).\n3 Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 18.\n4 This robbery in which the pirates gained money and goods worth about \u00a3360 (Rs. 3600) was cleverly and boldly planned. Three boats were lying at anchor in Bet harbour, when N\u00e1kwa K\u00e1si, the noted pirate, who had with him one man and some four or five women, asked to be taken across to some place in Cutch. Two of the captains refused, the third agreed. Presently, when two of the boats had left, K\u00e1si's men, throwing off their women's clothes, took possession of the third boat, sailed over to Cutch, landed the crew, and put out to sea. Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 18.\n5 Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 19.\nShortly after this great changes took place in Cutch. The province had with other parts of north Gujar\u00e1t suffered from locusts in 1811 and from a failure of rain in 1812, and in the next season, among the people reduced by want and crowded into the larger towns, a pestilence broke out that, carrying off half of their number, paralyzed the whole population. From this pestilence Fateh Muhammad did not escape. During the siege of Kanthkot in V\u00e1gad his army suffered so severely that he was forced to retire to Bhuj, and there, after a few days (October 5th, 1813), at the age of sixty-one he fell a victim to the disease.\n\nOf Fateh Muhammad it has already been noticed, that his first term of rule (1786 - 1801) was a period of great advance in Cutch, and that he had shown himself loyal to the R\u00e1o, friendly to the smaller chiefs, and kind to the common people. During his second term of rule, besides the feelings of suspicion and distrust stirred up by the faithless conduct of some of his former allies, his authority was never well established. The R\u00e1o disliked him and some of the chiefs openly resisted his power. In spite of the difficulties of the time he made several successful attempts to improve the trade of the country, and though keen for fame and anxious to enlarge the power of Cutch, he checked his ambition from leading him into ruinous foreign wars. The two main results of his rule were to make the people leave their villages and settle in towns; and to increase the power and wealth of the R\u00e1o at the expense of the smaller chiefs.\n\nWithin a month (October 30th, 1813) of the death of Fateh Muhammad, R\u00e1o R\u00e1yadhan sickened of fever and died. Through all the years of his confinement he had remained a staunch Musalman, showing his zeal for the faith by assuming the character and austerities of a fakir. He remained whole days with a staff in his hand, counting his beads, and reciting passages from the Kur\u00e1n. Within the palace he built a tomb, in which he directed his body to be laid. But the members of his family were able to prevent this, and his body was burned according to Hindu custom.\n\nOn the death of Fateh Muhammad, his two sons, Ibr\u00e1him Miy\u00e1n and Husain Miy\u00e1n, quietly succeeded to his power, their councils being directed by their father\u2019s chief adviser, Jagjivan Mehta a N\u00e1g\u00e1r Br\u00e1hman. The death of R\u00e1o R\u00e1yadhan caused further\n\n---\n\n1 During the previous years the smaller villages suffered so severely from the contests between Fateh Muhammad and the other chiefs that the people fled from them into the towns. Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 132. This crowding no doubt increased, if it did not give rise to, the pestilential fever.\n\n2 Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 19.\n\n3 Between Fateh Muhammad and Tipu Sult\u00e1n of Mysor there was close friendship with frequent interchange of letters and gifts. One of the gifts was a gun founded at Seringapatam and presented by the \u201cLion of the Faith\u201d to his friend Fateh Muhammad.\n\n4 By levying tributes and burdens on the Gir\u00e1s\u00edas he completed their dependence on the central authority.\n\n5 Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 133. The Muhammadan faction wanted to have his remains buried. But the Hindus with the help of 500 Rajputs stole the body, and, speedily preparing the pile, performed the Hindu rites.

As he had no legitimate children, Ladhubha, his brother's son, a boy eleven years old, had in 1809, in the negotiations with the British Government, been considered heir. But on the R\u00e1o's decease, the two brothers, Husain Miy\u00e1n and Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Miy\u00e1n, supported the claim of M\u00e1nsingji his illegitimate son. Jagjivan Mehta and other leading Hindus favoured Ladhubha's claim; the Jadeja chiefs were indifferent, and the brothers carried their point, and on the 13th January 1814, M\u00e1nsingji succeeded to the chiefship of Cutch with the title of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1dhir\u00e1j Mirza Mah\u00e1r\u00e1o Bh\u00e1rmalji. The succession was little more than nominal; the young R\u00e1o and his cousin were prisoners of state, while the management of affairs was in the hands of the Muhammadan faction.\n\nThe British Government continued to press for some settlement of its claims. The brothers were divided in opinion as to what answer to give; Husain was friendly and Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm hostile, denying that the British had any claim to interfere in Cutch affairs. Husain's views prevailed, and the British Government were asked to send an agent to Bhuj to adjust the matters in dispute. A native was at first sent, but afterwards (April 1814), on Husain Miy\u00e1n's invitation, Captain MacMurdo went from Morvi to Bhuj. He found Husain Miy\u00e1n well disposed, full of apologies for the loss caused to British subjects by the V\u00e1gad raids, but unable to do anything as he was weakened by the disaffection of his brother Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm, who had gone into outlawry and seized the V\u00e1gad fort of Kanthkot. Under Captain MacMurdo's advice Husain marched to reduce V\u00e1gad to order. But his funds failed, and without doing anything to restore order he returned to Bhuj. The whole country was now in revolt and so great mischief was caused in the neighbouring British territory that in June (1814), Husain was informed that the British and Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r troops could no longer delay advancing into Cutch and putting down the disorder. At the same time the Supreme Government refused to sanction the advance of an armed force, and the British agent was informed that he must do what he could by negotiation. In July 1814 Captain MacMurdo returned from Bhuj to Morvi. After he left, Bhuj was the scene of the greatest disorder. Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm was received into favour, and, under his and his mother's influence, a policy was determined on unfriendly to the British. Piracy was allowed almost to put a stop to trade. N\u00e1kwa K\u00e1si was invited back from Sind, and the murderer of Captain Phelan was taken into the service of the Mundra chief. Jagjivan Mehta opposed this change of policy, and on the 30th August both he and his family were most cruelly murdered.\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 20.\n2 Bom. Gov. Sel.

A second brother was similarly butchered, while a third, in the hope of bringing curses on the heads of the murderers underwent sam\u00e1dh or live burial, while some of the women of the family committed suicide. Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 23.\ntriumph did not last long. On the 23rd September, he was murdered by a M\u00e1rv\u00e1di officer in the R\u00e1o\u2019s employ, in the presence of his brother Husain and the minister Lakmid\u00e1s. Suspecting that the R\u00e1o had, through his guards, instigated his brother\u2019s murder, Husain exchanged them for a body of Arabs, and taking the M\u00e1rv\u00e1di soldiery by surprise put the whole of them, to the number of three hundred, to death. In spite of his Arab body-guard, Husain, after his brother\u2019s death, remained in a state of extreme alarm. The Arabs guarded the R\u00e1o, and full of suspicion and fear Husain remained at Bhuj. Meanwhile disorder spread. The Ch\u00f3b\u00e1ri and Bhach\u00e1u chiefs proclaimed their independence, and ravaged the country up to the walls of Bhuj. And at the same time, the V\u00e1gad robbers grew more and more daring and destructive, till, in October (1814), Husain was told that the British Government could no longer delay sending a force to restore order.\n\nAt Bhuj, the utter failure of Husain\u2019s management led to a movement, in which Shivr\u00e1j son of Hansr\u00e1j and \u00c1skarn were the chief actors, to place the young R\u00e1o at the head of affairs. After some months (January 1815), Husain agreed, on condition that Anj\u00e1r Bhach\u00e1u Bh\u00e1dargad and Kanthkot were written over to him in perpetuity, to deliver the keys of Bhuj to His Highness the R\u00e1o, and take with him most of his Arabs. While these negotiations were going on, in the hope that under a new Government disorder would be checked, the British troops refrained from entering Cutch. The young R\u00e1o, left in power, chose as ministers Shivr\u00e1j of M\u00e1ndvi and \u00c1skarn, the latter notoriously unfriendly to the British. The feelings of the R\u00e1o towards the British were not long of showing themselves. No answer was given on the subject of the V\u00e1gad banditti, and the British Native Agent was dismissed from Bhuj. Not many months after (August 30th, 1815), the V\u00e1gad banditti, about 500 strong, attacked Captain MacMurdo\u2019s camp, and were not beaten off till several lives were lost on both sides. At Bhuj things went from bad to worse. The R\u00e1o showed his dislike and hostility to the English, rewarded the banditti, and by an unprovoked attack on the chief of Asambia made his rule hateful to the J\u00e1deja chiefs. The more powerful of them, the chiefs of M\u00e1ndvi, Mundra, Anj\u00e1r, and S\u00edsagad stood aloof from the R\u00e1o, determined to keep what they held till they could bring the R\u00e1o into their power. After the attack on Captain MacMurdo\u2019s camp, the R\u00e1o made a short expedition into V\u00e1gad, and punished some of the chief banditti. He stayed only fifteen days and after he left,\n\n---\n\n1 Sir John Malcolm\u2019s Minute (June 1830).\n2 The V\u00e1gad robbers went in bands of horse and foot from 50 to 500 strong, 60 villages were laid waste, and property worth many lakhs of rupees was destroyed.\n3 Sir John Malcolm\u2019s Minute (June 1830).\n4 Several horses and a few camels were carried off. A stormy night and a divided camp made the attack most difficult to meet. Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 25.\n5 Attacking the fort of Juria, then in revolt against the J\u00e1m of Nav\u00e1nagar, the British found the garrison armed and helped from Bhuj. About the same time one of the chief freebooters received a robe of honour from the R\u00e1o. Sir John Malcolm\u2019s Minute (June 1830).\nthe robber raids were more destructive than ever.\\footnote{In a few months, 136 K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r villages were plundered, 40,000 head of cattle carried away, and \u00a320,000 worth of property destroyed. Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 25.} To put a stop to these disorders the British force, then reducing Juria in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, was held in readiness to invade Cutch, and about the middle of November 1815, a letter was delivered to the R\u00e1o, warning him that the troops would advance, if he did not at once arrange to pay compensation for the loss of the British and their allies; engage to prevent the raids of banditti in future; and give satisfaction for the affront he had committed in turning away the British Agent at Bhuj. Twelve days passed without an answer, and, when it did come (November 26th), the reply made no reference to any of the British demands. Accordingly, on the 14th of December, the force under Colonel East consisting of about 4000 fighting men, together with the Gaikw\u00e1r\u2019s troops, crossed the Ran at Ven\u00e1s\u00e1 about twelve miles east of Anj\u00e1r. The chief of V\u00e1ndia at once came into camp and threw himself on the mercy of Government, and negotiations went on between the British Agent and the chiefs of Anj\u00e1r, Mundra, M\u00e1ndvi, and S\u00eds\u00e1gad.\\footnote{Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 27.} The force advanced as far as Bhim\u00e1sar two marches from Anj\u00e1r, where it was discovered that the wells were poisoned. Next they moved on Anj\u00e1r, and as Husain Miy\u00e1n refused to let the British occupy it, the fort was invested on the morning of the 25th December at 10 o\u2019clock, and before evening was surrendered. Its port of Tuna was occupied on the next day. A few days later, Muhammad Sota the Mundra chief came into camp, and declared his wish to further the plans of the British Government. The force next moved towards Bhuj, encamping at L\u00e1kond on the 3rd January 1816. Here agents from Bhuj waited on Captain MacMurdo, and after some negotiations, on the 14th of January, it was finally agreed that the two Governments should be at peace and friendly; that compensation should be made for the losses in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r and for the military expenses; that the R\u00e1o should be responsible that in future no such loss should be incurred; that neither the subjects of the R\u00e1o nor the people of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r should cross the Ran with hostile intent; that piracy should be repressed, losses made good, and wrecks handed over to their owners; that no foreign European or American should pass through or live in Cutch, and that except a troop of 400 in the R\u00e1o\u2019s service, no Arabs should be allowed to settle in the province; that the Honourable Company should restore to the R\u00e1o any estates which his vassals had unjustly taken from him and should establish order in V\u00e1gad; that a representative of the Honourable Company should live at the R\u00e1o\u2019s capital; that the subjects of the Honourable Company should abstain from killing any cows or bullocks in Cutch; and that the R\u00e1o should engage to harbour no outlaw from K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. In return for the Company\u2019s help the R\u00e1o promised to hand over the fort of Anj\u00e1r and twenty-three other villages, and in addition to pay a yearly sum of about \u00a35277 (2 lakhs of koris).\\footnote{Aitchison\u2019s Treaties (1876), IV. 13-17, II. The exact amount, at 60 koris to the pound, is \u00a35277-10-11.}\nImmediately after the conclusion of this treaty, the British force was withdrawn from Bhuj and marched into V\u00e1gad, where its appearance at once established order. The towns of M\u00e1ndvi and Sis\u00e1gad were surrendered to His Highness, the fort of Kanthkot, one of the V\u00e1gad strongholds, was given up without a struggle, and on the approach of the British force, Bela, a centre of disorder, was surrendered. By the end of February order was completely established, and Captain MacMurdo was left at Anj\u00e1r with a small detachment. Bh\u00e1rm\u00e1lji was now for the first time in undisputed possession of Cutch. He gave himself up to drunkenness and the lowest sensuality, and the whole power of the Government fell into the hands of his prodigate favourites. The revenues for eight months in advance were seized from the cultivators, and over \u00a352,770 (2 lakhs of koris) were exacted in fines from the household officers and the managers of districts, and wasted in debauchery. No man of wealth was safe; the J\u00e1deja chiefs, with scarcely an exception, withdrew to their estates and never visited Bhuj. In June (18th) 1816, the British Government hoping to help the return of prosperity to Cutch, and to bind the R\u00e1o by strong feelings of friendship, gave up the sum of \u00a381,387 12s. (Rs. 8,13,876), due to it on account of military charges, and in addition forewent the yearly tribute of \u00a35277 (2 lakhs of koris). In return for this generous treatment, the R\u00e1o carefully carried out the remaining terms of the treaty. Captain MacMurdo was appointed Resident at Bhuj and Collector of Anj\u00e1r, and, shortly afterwards, when an envoy came from the Sind Amirs, proposing that the R\u00e1o should enter with them into a treaty hostile to the English, he met with no encouragement. In August 1816, or a few months after the signing of the treaty, the British Agent of Anj\u00e1r was disturbed by news that the R\u00e1o was about to move against him. That the R\u00e1o was collecting troops there was no doubt, and that his object was to attack the British was believed in many quarters. Timely remonstrances prevented matters going further, and shortly after (28th August), in sending word to the British of the birth of a son and heir to the Cutch chiefship, the R\u00e1o explained that an envoy from Sind, telling him that the English were making ready an expedition for the conquest of Cutch and Sind, had persuaded him to levy fresh troops.\n\nNo sooner were the V\u00e1gad banditti overawed than the east of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r began to suffer from forays of Khos\u00e1s and other Sind tribes. Their expeditions were conducted with great secrecy, speed, and daring. Towards the middle of 1817, these depredations increased, and the Amirs of Sind were informed, that if the stolen property was not speedily restored and robbery stopped, the marauders would be attacked in their place of refuge. The Amirs sent a force to P\u00e1rkar to overawe them, but the troops returned to Haidarabad without establishing order, and after they\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Sel.

XV. 37.\nleft the incursions into Cutch and Gujar\u00e1t were more daring than ever.\n\nOf the state of Cutch at this time (June 25th, 1818), Captain MacMurdo has left a detailed account. The country was bare of timber in many parts. Date trees were common, and near villages there were occasional lims, pipals, and babuls. But all other trees were grown only in special places. In the hilly tracts, except in low-lying patches of a few acres, there was little arable land. From the hill sides covered with stunted brushwood or bare, old stumps dug out for firewood, showed that they had once been forest-clad. There was little or no water, and the hills were rusty brown, desolate, and wretched. Of lands fit for grazing there were the brushwood covered sides of some of the hills, where numbers of sheep and goats were reared, and the large tract of the Banni feeding with the richest grass great herds of cows and buffaloes. The arable lands were the valleys between the two main ranges of hills, and the wide coast plain. The soil, except some rich plains in V\u00e1gad and in places under the hills, was a light clay, covered with from one to six inches of sand; near the sea it was broken by wild salt wastes. Ponds did not hold water, but wells were many and the supply they yielded was good. The crops were, for the early, November, harvest, millet, pulse, and cotton; for the late, January, harvest, millet and oil plants. There was no skilled tillage. The province was without Kanbis and the field workers were almost all herdsmen, \u00c1hirs, Rab\u00e1ris, Ch\u00e1rans, and Sindi Musalm\u00e1ns. The dry crop tillage was most slovenly and the outturn small. Irrigation was general and the tillage of watered lands was better than that of dry soils yielding crops of poor sugarcane, wheat, barley in the cold weather, and millet in the hot. Vegetables were raised in plenty, and Cutch grapes and melons had a good name. Still the agricultural wealth was very small. Its cotton, though sent in considerable quantities to Bombay and Arabia, was not clean enough for the European market. The Lakhpat rice lands were utterly bare, and half of the grain supply came from Sind, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, and the Malab\u00e1r coast. In animals Cutch was better off. The horses were excellent and high priced; the camels, bred in numbers, were fit for riding and baggage; the oxen and buffaloes, though most of them small and ugly, were abundant, and those of V\u00e1gad were equal to the finest cattle of west Gujar\u00e1t; the sheep and goats were plentiful and well-fed, their milk and butter supporting large classes of the people. There were several towns, M\u00e1ndvi with 50,000 people, with a brisk trade, a fleet of 800 boats of from about 15 to 150 tons (40-400 kh\u00e1ndis) burden, and a yearly revenue of \u00a325,000 (Rs. 2,50,000); Bhuj, with 20,000 people, justly celebrated for its ingenious artists in gold and silver work; Lakhpat, with 15,000 people, and a yearly revenue of \u00a36000 (Rs. 60,000); Mundra, with 12,000 people, and a yearly revenue of \u00a33000 (Rs. 30,000); and many towns of from 5000 to 10,000 souls. At the same time the people were very poor, the under-chiefs, in\n\n---\n\n1 Trans. Bom. Lit. Soc. II. 217-255.\ncase they should run away, had to treat their labourers with some consideration; but the R\u00e1o's subjects, who could not so readily move, were fined and plundered without mercy. The herdsmen, Ch\u00e1rans, Rab\u00e1ris and tribes of Sindi Musalm\u00e1ns, lived a rough unsettled life in small societies of six or eight families, in grass huts feeding chiefly on milk and butter. Of the trading classes some of the Bh\u00e1ti\u00e1s were rich, but the Loh\u00e1n\u00e1s had lost their old position and were chiefly labourers and husbandmen. The J\u00e1dej\u00e1s, the ruling class, were hopelessly idle, lazy, and debauched. 'To speak generally,' says Captain MacMurdo, 'the people are wretchedly poor, abominably debauched, and full of disease. Except in climate, the country is perhaps less favoured by nature than any I have heard of.'\n\nV\u00e1gad had, till lately, been entirely independent, 'the asylum of robbers and murderers of every description and country.' In other parts, where there was some show of authority, the Government was a pure aristocracy, the power vested in a variety of chiefs bearing a strong resemblance to the feudal baronies. Under each of these chiefs were the cadets of the chief's family, who owed military service to the head of their house. Over the chiefs was the R\u00e1o, to whom the chiefs owed military service. Originally the under-chief's duty was limited to defence. But of late years they had lent their services to superiors ambitious of foreign conquest. Except that, from a feeling of respect, the cadets or brotherhood, bh\u00e1y\u00e1d, of a house frequently submitted their differences to the decision of its head, neither the chiefs nor the R\u00e1o could, in the smallest degree, interfere in the village concerns of their relations the proprietors, gir\u00e1s\u00edas. Many of the proprietors had been stripped of their estates by Fateh Muhammed. But none of them paid any tax or tribute to the head of their house and none of the chiefs made any payment to the R\u00e1o.\n\nAbout this time the R\u00e1o's conduct gave rise to much complaint. Leading a very debauched life he gave great power to his profligate favourites, who extorted large sums from the people and drove into discontent the whole body of J\u00e1deja chieftains. It was a favourite scheme of the R\u00e1o and his advisers to reduce all the J\u00e1deja chiefs to the level of ordinary landowners. Efforts were constantly made to lower their power and lessen their possessions; and so great was the feeling of disaffection that, had the Resident not succeeded in persuading the R\u00e1o to give up the attempt to reduce the chiefs, civil war would almost certainly have broken out. Toward the close of the year the public feeling against the R\u00e1o was further strengthened by the unprovoked murder of his cousin Ladhubha. On hearing of Ladhubha's murder the British Government informed the R\u00e1o, that\n\n---\n\n1 Trans. Bom. Lit. Soc. 246-248.

Bombay Government Letter, 31st May 1818. East India Papers, III. 754.\nthey viewed his conduct with horror, and that if any violence was offered to Ladhubha's widow or to her child, the British Government would withhold from the R\u00e1o their countenance and support. In return the R\u00e1o, who under the influence of his profligate associates had for some time ceased to be well disposed to the English, pressed forward warlike preparations at Bhuj.\\(^1\\) He said, Ladhubha's death concerned no one but himself; he refused to give up Ladhubha's widow; and talked of the British Government with hate and scorn.\n\nIn September 1818, the Resident received a petition signed by eight of the leading J\u00e1deja chiefs, asking for the help of the British Government and complaining, that, though his only claim on them was for military service, the R\u00e1o was ill treating and fining his chiefs. Meanwhile the R\u00e1o continued to raise fresh troops and attacked \u00c1desar in V\u00e1gad, whose chief was then, under the terms of the first treaty, attending on Captain MacMurdo for the settlement of his difficulties with the R\u00e1o.\\(^2\\) Towards the close of the year the R\u00e1o's ill-feeling was so unmistakable, that the British Government decided to consider him a public enemy.\\(^3\\)\n\nIn the beginning of 1819 arrangements were made for the assembly of a force to coerce the R\u00e1o. The Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d were told that Government were anxious to settle the affairs of Cutch on a firm basis, and were asked to meet the Resident to consult on the subject. At the same time the Resident was told that, in the opinion of Government, order could not be established till the R\u00e1o was removed. On the 24th March 1819, with a British force, accompanied by the leading J\u00e1deja chiefs, the Resident encamped before the fort of Bhuj. The R\u00e1o was informed that the treaty of 1816 was suspended, and that the British Government had determined, in concert with the chiefs of his Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d, to organize the government of Cutch. He was called upon to repair to camp or take the consequences of resistance; and was assured that whatever decision might be come to regarding a successor to the throne, he would meet with the protection and consideration of the British Government.\n\nOn the morning of the 25th of March, as His Highness had not repaired to camp, the fort of Bhuj was escaladed. A few of the assailants were wounded but no lives were lost. On the following day His Highness gave himself up, and was placed under a guard. The Resident at once proceeded to discharge the mercenary troops and consult the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s regarding a successor to the chiefship. Their choice fell on a minor, the son of R\u00e1o Bh\u00e1rmalji, and, on the 19th April 1819, he was invested with the chiefship under the title of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j M\u00edrza R\u00e1o Shri Desalji. A regency was formed for the management of affairs. The British Government were anxious to leave every thing in the hands of the J\u00e1deja chiefs. But the chiefs refused, threatening, unless the Resident took charge of affairs, that they would leave things to take their course and retire to their estates. Under these circumstances it was arranged that the Resident should be head of the Regency and have\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 39.\n\n\\(^2\\) Sir John Malcolm's Minute (June 1830).\n\n\\(^3\\) Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 42.\nunder him some J\u00e1deja chiefs as members. One of the matters that most urgently called for settlement at the hands of the new Regency was the claims of the V\u00e1gad Gir\u00e1s\u00edas or land proprietors. In 1816, when the V\u00e1gad district was brought under order, these men fled to P\u00e1rkar and Vir\u00e1w\u00e1h on the borders of the desert, where, as the R\u00e1o refused to restore them to their rights in V\u00e1gad, they became the leaders of most formidable bands of robbers. The British Government had for long vainly urged the R\u00e1o to recall the refugees and give them back part of their land. Punj\u00e1j\u00ed, chief of Vir\u00e1w\u00e1h, a Sodha Rajput, had associated with himself, for they were hardly retainers, some 400 or 500 Khos\u00e1s, the scattered remains of a Musalm\u00e1n tribe who had been driven from Sind in 1786, on the downfall of the Kalhora dynasty. Since they had been driven from Sind the Khos\u00e1s lived in the wildest part of the desert and along the edge of the Ran, plundering and levying blackmail on the neighbouring districts either on their own account, or in concert with some more powerful chief. In the former case they divided the spoil, and in the latter they gave the chief a fourth, chauth. Of late years, with the help of the Khos\u00e1s, the Vir\u00e1w\u00e1h chief had sent plundering expeditions, of from 200 to 800 horse and foot, into Gujar\u00e1t and Cutch, as well as along the edge of the Ran to Rahim-ki-b\u00e1z\u00e1r in Sind. In May 1819 a party of 800 men, mounted on camels and horses, advancing by the Ran attacked Bhach\u00e1u in south V\u00e1gad, close to the gulf. They were driven off by the guns of the fort but not till they had secured 200 head of cattle. From Bhach\u00e1u removing about two miles to Vond, a fine flourishing village, they shut the gates, and after plundering the town carried off from \u00a33500 to \u00a34000 (Rs. 35,000 - 40,000). To put a stop to these disorders, the Resident offered, under the following conditions, to restore the V\u00e1gad Gir\u00e1s\u00edas to their lands. They were to show no help or favour to any British or Cutch outlaw; to allow no thieves to live on their lands and to make good any loss by theft; to refer disputes to the arbitration of the Cutch and British Governments; to stop or give information of bands of plunderers; to serve the R\u00e1o faithfully in times of war; to pay a yearly revenue; and to let all forts be dismantled. To these terms the Gir\u00e1s\u00edas agreed and order was established.\n\nThe affairs of the state were beginning to prosper when the earthquake of June 16th, 1819, caused the greatest loss of life and destruction of property, and laying low almost every place of strength left the province exposed to the attacks of its enemies. The Amirs of Sind made an attempt to take advantage of the opportunity. Their agent at Bhuj was instructed to ask the Resident to give up the port of Lakhpat, which he asserted the former R\u00e1o had constantly offered; if the Resident refused to give it, he was, it was believed, instructed to demand it under the threat of invasion. But the request was refused and the demand was not pressed. Shortly after, it was discovered that the ex-R\u00e1o\u2019s sister, Kesab\u00e1\u00ed, in concert\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 43.\n2 Details of the loss caused by the earthquake will be found above p. 16.\nwith one of the R\u00e1o's wives, had planned to murder Lakmid\u00e1s, the minister; to attack the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s at Bhuj; to overcome the guard over her brother; and to carry him off. The chief plotters were seized, and Kesab\u00e1i, who had steadily refused all marriage offers, was, in the beginning of 1820, induced to bestow her hand on the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1gad. During this time, the terms of the treaty between the British and Cutch Governments were prepared and concluded in October 1819. The chief provisions were; that R\u00e1o Bh\u00e1rmalji should be deposed and kept as a state prisoner; that he should be succeeded by his infant son; that during the minority the affairs of Government should be managed by a Regency, composed of the British Resident and five other members; that the Company should guarantee the integrity of the Cutch dominions against foreign or domestic enemies; that the Company should station a force in Cutch to be paid out of Cutch revenues; that the Cutch Government should entertain no foreign soldiers and import no arms in foreign vessels; that the Company should exercise no authority in the domestic concerns of the R\u00e1o or of the J\u00e1deja chiefs, introduce no civil or criminal jurisdiction, and limit changes to the organization or reform of the Cutch military establishment, the correction of abuses, and the reduction of expenses; that the R\u00e1o and his heirs should enter into no negotiation without the sanction of the British Government, submit disputes to its arbitration, and when wanted help the British Government with their military force; that Cutch ports should be open to all British vessels; that the British Government should guarantee the J\u00e1deja chiefs their possessions; that the R\u00e1o and the chiefs should engage to stop infanticide, and the British Government to prevent the slaughter of cows, bullocks, and peacocks.\n\nThe Resident, as the head of the Cutch Government with his European and Native assistants, set to work to bring order and system into the government of the province. Progress was most difficult; all was confusion, the exchequer was empty, future revenue had been forestalled, and the state had no body of trustworthy servants.\n\nThough order was established in Cutch, nothing had been done to put a stop to the excesses of the Khos\u00e1s and other desert robbers. During the year 1819 constant complaints were made to the Sind authorities. They sent a force into P\u00e1rkar, harassed and fined the people, but did so little to settle the district that, immediately after they left, in December 1819, a party of 250 Khos\u00e1s made a raid into the Banni grazing grounds in the north of Cutch, and were prevented from carrying away the cattle only by the bravery of the people and of the outposts, who at the cost of several lives attacked the robbers and recovered the spoil. In the beginning of 1820, so great was the banditti's insolence, that a force was made ready to act against them. This caused the Sind Amirs much alarm, and the unfortunate\n\n---\n\n1 Afterwards on her husband's death Kesab\u00e1i came back and lived in Cutch.\n2 The treaty is given in full in Aitchison's Treaties (1876), IV. 18-22, IV.; Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 50.\n3 Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 47.\naccident of an attack by British troops on a Sind outpost, thinking they were a body of Khos\u00e1s, so enraged the Amirs that they at once despatched three armies, one to Lakhpat in the west, a second to Kh\u00e1vda in the centre, and a third to P\u00e1rkar in the east. One of these forces actually entered Cutch and plundered a village.\n\nTowards the close of the year (November 9th, 1820), the Amirs, through their agent at Bombay, entered into an agreement of perpetual friendship with the British Government, and engaged to allow no European or American to live in Sind; to surrender offenders; and to check the depredation of the Khos\u00e1s and other robber tribes. In spite of the efforts of the Amirs so little were the excesses of the robber tribes suppressed, that, to allay the feeling of utter insecurity in V\u00e1gad, 400 of the Poona Irregular Horse were in 1822 stationed on the Lodr\u00e1ni frontier in the north-east corner of the province. In the same year May 21st, 1822, as the Cutch authorities were anxious to have it back, and as from its isolated position its possession was inconvenient to the British Government, the district of Anj\u00e1r was restored for a yearly payment of \u00a38800 (Rs. 88,000). At the same time it was stipulated that the British troops should continue to hold the fort of Bhujia, near the city of Bhuj. Meanwhile improvement in the administration of the province was steadily pressed on. Without any collecting staff, and with no knowledge of the resources of the land, the Resident had no choice but to let cut the revenues to farmers. This was done in 1820 for a term of five years. At the same time every effort was made to curtail expenditure, the mercenary troops were reduced, and under the most intelligent leaders, to protect person and property, detachments were stationed in different parts of the province. A regular system of accounts was introduced, and in every department the utmost economy consistent with the R\u00e1o\u2019s dignity was enforced.\n\nAfter a year or two of order and good harvests Cutch again entered on a time of suffering. The 1823 rains failed and in the famine that followed, thousands of cattle died, and whole villages were deserted. A fifth of its people, it was estimated, left the province. This trouble was followed early in 1825 by rumours of disturbances and hostile preparations in Sind. These rumours were soon confirmed by the advance from Sind of a body of plunderers, 3000 strong, who crossed the Ran from Rahim-ki-b\u00e1z\u00e1r to the Pachham, and took possession of a fort in the Haba hills, eighteen miles north of Bhuj. From their stronghold the plunderers sent 800 men against Anj\u00e1r. Successful at first, they were afterwards driven out of the town with considerable loss, including the death of their leader. Meanwhile,\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 52.\n2 So thoroughly unsafe was V\u00e1gad at this time, that the people worked in their fields armed to the teeth. Bom. Gov. Sel.

Tod, who was in Cutch in 1823, found it thinly peopled and poorly tilled with not more than 500,000 inhabitants and a revenue of about \u00a3160,000 (50 lakhs of koris). \u00a7ths belonging to the R\u00e1o and \u00a7ths to the Bh\u00e9d\u00e1di. Trade was dull and M\u00e1ndvi, if the figures are to be trusted, had since 1818 very suddenly fallen off in people from 50,000 to 20,000; in port revenues from \u00a325,000 to \u00a310,000 (Rs. 2\u00bd-1 lakh); and in shipping from 800 to 200 boats. Western India, 452-459.\na force sent against Haba drove out and dispersed the main body of the plunderers, but not without a loss to the state of \u00a320,000 (Rs. 2,00,000). During the next year the uneasy feeling of Sind hostility, and the disaffection of some of the Jadeja chiefs, led to the increase of the British troops in Cutch to 6000 men. After this except for occasional raids from P\u00e1rkar, Cutch enjoyed some years of quiet.\n\nIn 1830, when Sir John Malcolm, Governor of Bombay, visited Cutch he found the ex-R\u00e1o practically free from restraint and living in his son\u2019s house satisfied with his position. The young Prince then fourteen years of age was a youth of uncommon promise. The Resident, Colonel Pottinger, had attended with care to his education and he had gained much from the lessons of the Revd. Mr. Gray, the Chaplain at Bhuj. The Jadeja chiefs, that were presented to the Governor at Bhuj, were anxious that the ex-R\u00e1o\u2019s guard should be removed, that the young R\u00e1o should share in the management of public affairs, and that the tribute from Cutch to the British Government should be reduced. The first request the Governor granted. The guard had for some time been little more than nominal, and there seemed no reason to fear that the ex-R\u00e1o would intrigue for a restoration to power. As regarded the second request, the Governor had no objection to the name of the young R\u00e1o being introduced into public deeds and to his being gradually initiated into the management of affairs, but he decided that he was still too young to bear the whole burden of business. As to the Anj\u00e1r payment, the Governor could promise no relief. The revenue of the district had been small and the marriage of the young R\u00e1o had caused special expenses, still the country was increasing in wealth, the payment was not large, and the British Government were not in a position to remit it. The Governor took advantage of the occasion to call the chiefs to account for their failure to give any help in putting down the bands of plunderers. Considering themselves shielded by the British guarantee from the just resentment of their Prince, they had made not one effort to protect his towns from plunder or his fields from devastation. They had saved their own estates at the price of a base, if not a traitorous inactivity. There was nothing, he said, in the guarantee obligation that freed them from their allegiance to their prince and the aid they were bound to give him. Hereafter any chief who was supine and did not exert himself to the utmost to oppose and destroy his prince\u2019s enemies or plunderers, should be dealt with as an abettor of his enemies, and, as the slightest punishment, should be held to have forfeited all rights to British protection. Of the relations between the R\u00e1o and the Jadeja chiefs or Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d, Sir John Malcolm added, that though, as far as outward show went, the chiefs yielded the R\u00e1o a respect bordering on veneration, they had never hesitated when it suited their personal.\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 55.\n2 Sir John Malcolm\u2019s Minute (June 1830). This hope was not disappointed. The ex-R\u00e1o till his death in 1846 lived in the palace with his son, without in any way interfering with state affairs.\n3 Sir John Malcolm\u2019s Minute (June 1830).\ninterests or gratified their passions of revenge or ambition to rebel against their ruler's authority, and at times to dethrone him.\\(^1\\) This conduct on their part had led their princes to similar acts of violence when they gained absolute power either by the aid of mercenaries or of some of their dependents. Sir John Malcolm regretted that at the time of framing the treaty (1822) some more specific obligations had not been imposed on the smaller chiefs. Secure in the protection of the British Government they had become indolent and indifferent to all matters that did not immediately affect their personal interests. Lost in the enjoyment of sensual pleasures they neglected all improvement and sought every means of oppression. They had encroached upon their ruler till his revenues bore no proportion to his position as their head. Any case of helping rebels or failing to act against plunderers should be followed by forfeiture or heavy fine.\\(^2\\) In the Governor's opinion the only measure likely to render the continuance of these chiefs in the power they enjoyed safe and useful, was for the Resident to bring near his person some of their relations and adherents, who, he thought, the chiefs would gladly maintain under the impression that it was the best means of acquiring influence and favour. There was no course so well suited to explain the views and principles of the British Government to the people, as for the Resident to have near his person the sons, brothers, and relations of the chiefs of the country.\n\nFrom Sir A. Burnes' notes on Cutch, during the five years ending 1828, it would seem that the people were settling down to orderly ways. In good seasons the population was not less than 500,000 souls. Still many were unsettled, whole villages moving to Sind if the season were bad. The common grains were millet and pulse, and in Abd\u00e1sa cotton, castor-oil, and tobacco. As a rule, Cutch had to import food, especially much coarse red rice from Sind, and dates from Arabia. Though the soil suited them there was a great want of vegetables. Sheep and goats were abundant and there was a considerable export of butter. Besides the foreign trade by sea there was in Abd\u00e1sa a large pack traffic with M\u00e1rw\u00e1r and Gujar\u00e1t.\\(^3\\) Of the different divisions Abd\u00e1sa alone was prosperous. V\u00e1gad in the east was thinly peopled and poorly tilled. Half of it was waste and so overrun with lions, tigers, panthers, wolves, hy\u00e6nas, and other wild beasts that the cultivators were careful to be safe in their villages before sunset. The chiefs and proprietors, though almost all of one family, were always fighting usually about village boundaries. Success was never lasting. The defeated rival would mortgage his land, add to his band of mercenaries, and overrun his neighbour's fields. The J\u00e1dej\u00e1s were a worthless set of spendthrifts mortgaging their estates, wasting their property, and many of them sinking to be common husbandmen and field labourers. In the grazing lands in the north and on the Ran islands there was a rough, unsettled, and poor, but hearty and strong population. Living in grass huts, almost never growing or eating grain, they fed\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Sir John-Malcolm's Minute (June 1830).  \n\\(^2\\) MS.

They had large herds of cows, buffaloes, and camels, and flocks of sheep and goats, and the export of butter brought in enough to meet their wants for clothes, tobacco, and opium.\n\nIn 1832 the P\u00e1rkar robbers began to give fresh trouble. Towards the end of the year a force was sent into P\u00e1rkar to punish the freebooters, and several of the leading men were killed. The Sind Government sent some troops to co-operate with the British detachment, but they did not actually take part against the freebooters. With the view of securing Cutch against any further depredation the Sind Government were asked whether they would prefer to make good all losses on account of robberies or allow a British detachment to remain at P\u00e1rkar. They chose to allow the detachment to be posted at P\u00e1rkar, and after this the vigilance of the officers to whom the charge of the frontier was entrusted, and the gallantry of the British troops secured comparative peace to Cutch, and in a few years a cessation of desert inroads.\n\nThough, with order well established and a firm but mild Government, the province was slowly recovering from the effects of many years of civil war, it was unable to pay the sum, amounting altogether to about \u00a333,800 (Rs. 3,38,000) due under former treaties to the British Government. Under these circumstances, in September 1832, the amount in arrears, a little over \u00a325,000 (Rs. 2,50,000) was struck off and a modified treaty drawn up, providing that the equivalent of the Anj\u00e1r revenue should be forgone and that the Cutch state should never be charged more than \u00a320,000 for the pay of the subsidiary force.\n\n---\n\n1 MS. February 1827. From Gadhada in Khadir island every year as much as 32,000 pounds (800 mans) of butter are said to have been sent, and every day from the Banni there was an export of 120 to 160 pounds (3-4 mans).\n\n2 The details are, tribute about \u00a35000 (2 lakhs of koris); Anj\u00e1r revenue, \u00a38800 (Rs. 88,000); pay of the subsidiary force, \u00a320,000.\n\n3 The exact sum was \u00a325,725 10s. (Rs. 2,57,255).\n\n4 Aitchison's Treaties (1876), IV., 26-28, VII.

He showed considerable ability, could read and write English, and had a useful general knowledge of arithmetic, and of the outlines of astronomy. In 1833 he began to take part in public business and soon showed himself equal to the conduct of ordinary affairs. He attended daily at the Residency, constantly coming from the palace to consult the Resident on any doubtful point. In consequence of the zeal and ability he showed, it was arranged that the time of his coming of age should be changed from August 1835 to the 8th July 1834. At the installation all due honour was done by the British officers present and gratefully and graciously acknowledged by the R\u00e1o. The Resident, Colonel Pottinger, on seating the young prince on the throne, bound on his turban some rich jewels from Lord Clare, the Governor of Bombay, presented him with a letter of friendship and saluted him R\u00e1o of Cutch. People of all classes shewed great enthusiasm.\n\nR\u00e1o Desalji continued to rule till 1860. Besides the measures noticed in a separate place for the repression of infanticide, the R\u00e1o took steps to put a stop to the trade in slaves, and to the burning of widows. In 1836 a proclamation was issued, warning his subjects that dealing in slaves was illegal, and that any vessel bringing slaves into Cutch would be confiscated, and her crew and owners punished. Since then, except the modified form of bondage in the households of Rajput and other chiefs, slavery has ceased in Cutch. In the matter of widow burning, the R\u00e1o was less ready to adopt the English view. He held that the practice was not against the Hindu scriptures, and it was not till 1852, that he was persuaded to forbid it. After this, in one or two cases, the people concerned were severely dealt with.\n\nR\u00e1o Desalji's government was on the whole prosperous; order was maintained and the wealth and resources of the province developed.

There will be no departure from this resolution. A vessel which brings slaves shall be seized, and summary punishment inflicted on those who navigate her. The British Government have made arrangements to suppress the trade in slaves throughout the adjacent countries, and it has instructed the officers commanding its ships to seize and retain all vessels bringing slaves.

In the same year the population was returned at 409,522 souls, of which 212,623 lived in the R\u00e1o\u2019s towns and villages; 166,864 in those of the smaller chiefs; and 30,035 in alienated villages. Of the whole population, 300,420 were Hind\u00fas, and 109,102 Musalm\u00e1ns. The total revenue of the province was estimated at \u00a3124,164 (Rs. 12,41,640), of which the R\u00e1o\u2019s share was returned at \u00a371,540 (Rs. 7,15,400); the small chiefs\u2019 share at \u00a344,608 (Rs. 4,46,080); and the alienated revenue at \u00a38015 (Rs. 80,150). Of the R\u00e1o\u2019s share \u00a320,719 came from land, \u00a317,466 from sea customs, \u00a31614 from transit dues, \u00a349 from alum, and \u00a331,691 from town dues, sales of animals, fines, and gifts. As regards the tenure of land, in the Gir\u00e1sia villages, as the father\u2019s property was divided among the sons, there were generally a large number, sometimes as many as seventy or eighty sharers. Unless forced by poverty the sharers seldom tillled with their own hands. In troubled times the shrewdest or strongest of the chiefs\u2019 sons had generally risen to be head and forced the other members to keep the peace. Now the authority of all was the same, and disputes were endless and most complicated. In most villages there was a good deal of rent-free land either belonging to Rajputs who were not village proprietors, gir\u00e1s\u00edas, or held on service tenure. But with these exceptions the actual cultivators were in a deplorable condition, unable to work as hard as they could, to earn more than a bare livelihood, constantly driven from their land by the exacting Gir\u00e1s\u00edas, kept at work by nothing but the fear of starvation. Besides the produce shares varying from one-third to one-half, there were payments of grain to village officers and police, and plough and other ready money cesses. The arrangements in the R\u00e1o\u2019s villages were not very different. But the people were less harshly treated and the villages more populous and thriving. Much arable land was waste. Under better management the province could produce manifold what it was yielding.\n\nTrade was hampered by sea customs and transit dues. All the ports were under the R\u00e1o. Foreign goods could be brought into the country only through the ports, and the customs revenue of M\u00e1ndvi, the chief port, was more than \u00a320,000. Merchants taking goods from the ports into the interior paid from one-tenth to one-half of their value. In 1852, in consequence of repeated pressure from the Political Agent, a reduction in sea customs was sanctioned. But the land transit dues, especially in the east, continued most oppressive. Between the eastern frontier and Bhuj, a cart of grain had to pay dues and cesses equal to its original value. The difficulty in dealing with the land dues was that many of the smaller chiefs drew a large part of their incomes from them, and refused to reduce them.\n\nExcept that murder and other heinous crimes were sent for punishment to the R\u00e1o, the smaller chiefs generally inquired into and\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 72-74.\ndecided such cases of crime as occurred on their estates. In the towns and territories belonging to His Highness the R\u00e1o, crimes were usually investigated by an arbitration court, and afterwards examined and disposed of by the R\u00e1o himself. In V\u00e1gad, where in the early years of British interference the power of the local chiefs had been broken, the police was, under the Assistant Political Agent, conducted by a body of 104 horsemen, posted in different villages throughout the district. A native officer and writer constantly moved from one post to another, and partly because news of a crime was so quickly spread, partly from the isolated character of the country and the risk criminals ran of being caught, the amount of serious crime was small.\n\nIn the chiefs' territories petty offences were tried without appeal or reference. The graver charges that went before the R\u00e1o were heard by him personally, sometimes with the help of the Political Agent. The R\u00e1o disliked capital punishments, and never, if he could help it, passed a sentence of death. The evidence of the parties was roughly taken down; but no formal record of proceedings was kept. It was suggested to the R\u00e1o that the forms of civil and criminal proceedings followed in the Sind Desert district, might be of use in Cutch. But he was disinclined to the change, thinking the procedure too complicated for his officers. Civil disputes were, over the whole province, settled by arbitration, the tenants of the petty chiefs bearing any amount of oppression, rather than appeal against the acts and decisions of their lords and masters.\n\nThe position of the smaller chiefs was, except in V\u00e1gad, very independent of the R\u00e1o. The only tribute they paid was some customary present on the marriage of the heir apparent or other similar occasions. Their assertion, that the only claim the R\u00e1o had upon them was one of military service, was admitted in 1819, and since then the British guarantee for the security of their possessions, had tended to increase their independence. The absence of common danger had relaxed the feudal bonds that united them to their head. But it was believed that, should the occasion arise, they would be ready and willing to call together their retainers, and putting aside petty disputes rally round the yellow pennant of their hereditary chief.\u00b9\n\nFor some years there was an unfortunate quarrel between R\u00e1o Desalji and his eldest son.\u00b2 But before the close of his life friendly relations were established. In 1859, as he had for some time been suffering from serious sickness, the R\u00e1o prayed Government by appointing a regency to relieve him from the weight of state affairs. His wish was granted, and on the 12th July, under the Political Agent as President the R\u00e1o chose the heir apparent, the minister, and two J\u00e1deja chiefs, as members of the Regency.\u00b3 On the 21st June of the next year, at the R\u00e1o's urgent request, the Regency was dissolved and the management of the state handed over to the heir\n\n\u00b9 Bom.

A few weeks later, on the 26th July R\u00e1o Desalji died; and on the 28th of the same month R\u00e1o Pr\u00e1gmalji was duly installed.\\(^1\\) Marked by a love of truth and plain dealing, R\u00e1o Desalji was probably more than any one else in Cutch, learned in the traditions and customs of the province. He was a careful and painstaking judge and a staunch and devoted ally of the British Government. With the help of a few chiefs and court servants he managed the whole business of the country, and by his knowledge of their character, friendly intercourse, and timely concessions avoided any struggle with the Jadeja chiefs.\\(^2\\)\n\nR\u00e1o Pr\u00e1gmalji soon showed himself in several respects different in character from his father. Equally truthful and loyal to the British Government, he had more courtly manners, more refined and costly tastes, and a much higher idea of his power and prerogative. During the fifteen years of his rule (1860-1875), R\u00e1o Pr\u00e1gmalji showed himself anxious to improve the management of his state. He framed codes for the guidance of his officers in matters of civil and criminal justice, he undertook works of public usefulness, and introduced a state system of education and vaccination. In reward for his efforts at good government, he was, in 1871, honoured with the title of Knight Grand Commander of the Star of India. Unlike his forefathers, none of whom left Cutch, he thrice visited Bombay, in 1870 to meet His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh, in 1871 to take part in a Chapter of the Star of India, and in October 1875 to do homage to His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales. On the last occasion, suffering from a mortal disease, he retired to Bhuj and unable to rally, died on the 1st January 1876. By his death, Cutch lost a wise and beneficent ruler, and the British Government a loyal and devoted friend.\\(^3\\)\n\nThe chief memorial of his reign, a work in which he took a very keen interest and on which he spent a sum of \u00a3191,400, was the building of a palace at Bhuj. One long struggle over the position and rights of the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d greatly marred the success of his reign. A statement of the chief points that have been raised and discussed since, in 1819, the chiefs' position was guaranteed is given (pp.189-200) in the chapter on \"Justice\". Though the matter was not perfectly settled, the R\u00e1o had, before his death, the satisfaction of knowing that most of the points on which he laid the greatest stress had been conceded. R\u00e1o Pr\u00e1gmalji left four widows, of whom two have since died, two sons, and one daughter.\n\nOn the 3rd January (1876) the young R\u00e1o was installed with the usual ceremonies. As he was only ten years of age, a Regency consisting of the Political Agent, the chief minister, a Jadeja chief, and a leading merchant was appointed, and under the supervision of the Political Agent has since managed the affairs of the state.\n\nThe R\u00e1o is entitled to a salute of seventeen guns and holds a\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Col. H. W. Trevelyan, C.B., to Govt. 8th June 1861.\n\\(^2\\) Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 68; Col. Barton.\n\\(^3\\) Government Gazette, 5th January 1876.\npatent, sanad, of adoption. The military force of the state consists of two field and 109 other guns, twenty-four artillerymen, 373 cavalry, 402 regular and 3139 irregular infantry, and 412 police. In addition to these troops the Rao's Bhayad could furnish on requisition a mixed force of about 4000 men. A genealogical tree of the family is given in Appendix A.\n\nThe following summary, compiled from the yearly administration reports, gives very shortly the chief events in the history and management of Cutch during the last twenty-five years.\n\nIn 1860 an almost total failure of rain was followed by extreme scarcity of provisions. The price of millet rose from 40 to 20\u00bd pounds; people moved in large numbers to Sind, Kathiawar, and Bombay, and thousands of cattle were either driven away in search of pasture, or perished. To lessen the pressure of distress, the Rao for two months took off all import duties on grain and fodder; offered work in deepening ponds near Bhuj to large numbers of the destitute, paying each about two pounds of grain a day; and opened stores at which grain was sold at specially low prices. When the scarcity was over, as many as 60,000 people were said to have come back. In this year, the management of the Vagad police, which had long been under the Cutch Political Agency, was restored to the state.\n\nThe next year, 1861, was again a season of short rainfall, only 8\u00bd inches. But the falls were well timed, and a fair crop brought down millet prices. The old minister resigned, and the management of Motilal Jivandas and Madhavdas Ramdas who succeeded, caused some discontent among the landed classes. Several works of public usefulness were pressed on; cotton gins were ordered and screw presses introduced, and the Bhuj and Mandvi road was finished and bridged.\n\nThe 1862 rainfall was heavy, 34 inches. The rains closed (October) with a tremendous storm that, besides damaging the crops, caused much loss of life and great destruction of houses and villages. This loss was increased by a plague of locusts. The grain crops suffered most, and though the high price of cotton benefited the country, living was dear, millet prices standing as high as 30 pounds the rupee. Over 25,000 people are said to have left Cutch in search of work.\n\nIn 1863, the rainfall, 23-24 inches, was sufficient and well-timed, and the harvest good. The very high value of cotton had tempted cultivators greatly to increase its cultivation, and before the season was over, in the large towns and among the labouring classes grain was so scarce and dear, that there was severe distress. Millet prices rose from 30 to 16 pounds. As a measure of relief a state store was opened and grain sold at low rates. Money was also gathered from\n\n---\n\n1 Aitchison's Treaties (1876), IV. 9.\n2 Col. H. W. Trevelyan, C.B., 8th June 1861.\n3 In the town of Bhuj 1900 houses were damaged, and in Vagad many villages were found in ruins.\n4 The locusts are said to have come from the east and north. After devastating Cutch they would seem to have been driven west and out to sea. Ship Captains from Maskat and Zanzibar, some hundred miles from Mandvi, found the sea covered with their dead bodies.\nrich Cutch traders in M\u00e1ndvi and Bombay, and given to the destitute. As many as 35,000 of the poor and working classes are said to have left Cutch. The management of the new ministers continued unsatisfactory. Corruption spread, and at last, one glaring case of tampering with the currency being brought to light by the Political Agent, Motil\u00e1l and M\u00e1dhavd\u00e1s were suspended, and the chief management entrusted to an old servant of the state, Jagjivan Mehta a N\u00e1g\u00e1r Br\u00e1hman.\n\n1864.\n\nIn 1864, a very scanty rainfall of only seven inches, was followed by a short harvest and a rise in the price of millet from 16 to 15\u00bd pounds. Among the cultivators the want of fodder and water, and among the poorer classes of townspeople the high price of grain caused great distress. The state import duties on grain were remitted, and, against about 8000 return-emigrants, about 23,000 people are said to have left the country. The management of the state was again unsatisfactory. Jagjivan\u2019s power had, in great measure, passed to Valabhji Mehta a Mod V\u00e1nia, a man of great ability who had formerly been mixed up with the R\u00e1o\u2019s family quarrels.\n\n1865.\n\nIn 1865, the rainfall, 16\u00b761 inches, was sufficient and well-timed, and the harvest good. Though, from the very great dearness of food all over the Presidency, millet prices remained steady at 22 pounds, prices of labour rose in proportion, and it was on the whole a prosperous year. During the course of the season 8580 people are said to have returned, and 23,750 to have left the province in search of work. In state matters Valabhji\u2019s power increased, and Jagjivan was dismissed.\n\n1866.\n\nIn 1866, the rainfall, 20\u00b772 inches, was sufficient. But it did not begin till the end of July and then fell so fast that in some parts the houses suffered. Millet prices still continued high, 27\u00bd pounds the rupee. But wages were at least in proportion, and while emigrants fell to 18,600, the number who returned rose to 13,970. From April to October, the eastern parts of Cutch, as far west as Bhuj and M\u00e1ndvi, suffered from a rather severe epidemic of cholera. Valabhji was found to be mismanaging the state for his private gain, and to be causing a growing ill-feeling among the minor chiefs. At the Political Agent\u2019s advice he was dismissed, and the deputy collector of Surat, Mr. Sh\u00e1h\u00e1bud\u00edn Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm was appointed minister. During this year a son and heir was born to the R\u00e1o.\n\n1867.\n\nIn 1867, the rainfall, though it lasted late, was very scanty, 7\u00b796 inches; the crops, especially cotton suffered, and the want of water and grass caused much distress. The price of millet was 22 pounds the rupee. During the year 20,267 persons are reported to have left the province, and 10,895 to have come back. Under Mr. Sh\u00e1h\u00e1bud\u00edn\u2019s management many important improvements were made.\n\n1868.\n\nIn 1868, the rainfall, 8\u00b731 inches, was short, and falling at long intervals, failed to keep alive the young crops. The serious scarcity in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na increased the pressure of the bad local harvest, and millet prices rose to 21\u00bd pounds. Besides of grain, there was a scarcity, and, in some parts, an absolute want of fodder and water.\nTo lighten the distress grain was allowed to pass duty-free. During the year Mr. Sh\u00e1h\u00e1budin resigned, and was succeeded by Mr. Bhogil\u00e1l Pr\u00e1nvalabh\u00e1d\u00e1s.\n\nIn 1869, the rainfall, 23\u00b725 inches, was sufficient and well-timed. But prospects were spoiled by locusts, who all over the district caused much loss, and in some places utterly ruined the millet crop with a rise of prices from $21\\frac{1}{2}$ to 18 pounds. Large numbers, made destitute by the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na famine, took shelter in Cutch. Transit duties on grain were again remitted. In state affairs some improvements in the revenue system were carried out, and for the guidance of judicial officers civil and criminal procedure codes were framed.\n\nIn 1870, the rainfall, 7\u00b780 inches, was short, and the harvest poor, with millet prices at $22\\frac{1}{2}$ pounds. Most of the famine immigrants returned to R\u00e1jput\u00e1na and transit grain duties were again levied.\\(^1\\) Some useful changes, including the separation of the functions of magistrate and revenue farmer, were introduced into the management of state lands. At the same time the disputes between the R\u00e1o and the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d on matters of jurisdiction became so serious as to call for the interference of Government.\n\nIn 1871, the rainfall, 13 inches, though sufficient was ill-timed, the harvest was poor, and millet prices remained as high as $24\\frac{1}{2}$ pounds. Though attempts were made to reduce them, grain transit duties were still levied. Considerable trouble was caused by the raids of the Deda outlaws, Gir\u00e1s\u00ed\u00e1s of Morvi in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, who had taken shelter in V\u00e1gad. Under the Political Agent\u2019s advice, the R\u00e1o and the Morvi Managers joined in appointing an officer to act against the outlaws, and order was soon restored. The question of the R\u00e1o\u2019s jurisdiction over the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d was discussed by Government and the R\u00e1o, and some advance made in clearing and settling the chief points in dispute. During this year, the Bohor\u00e1s or Musalm\u00e1n traders were freed from a remnant of V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1 oppression, by the abolition of an old order forbidding them to ride on horseback. The R\u00e1o\u2019s efforts to improve the administration of his state and introduce a useful system of state education and vaccination were rewarded by his being raised to the dignity of a Knight Grand Commander of the Star of India.\n\nIn 1872, the rainfall, 17\u00b706 inches, was sufficient and timely, but the hopes of a good harvest were spoiled by the ravages of locusts. The price of millet remained as high as $29\\frac{1}{4}$ pounds. The state also suffered from a severe attack of cattle plague, which was said to have caused the deaths of 2447 head of cattle of the estimated value of nearly \u00a34000 (Rs. 40,000). So acute was the disease that in most cases animals stricken with it lived only a few hours. As Knight Grand Commander of the Order, His Highness the R\u00e1o attended a Darb\u00e1r and Chapter of the Star of India in Bombay. The J\u00e1deja court still worked badly; but progress was made towards the settlement of some of the points in dispute.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Bom. Ad. Rep. (1870-71, 147).\nIn 1873, the rainfall was partial, varying from 5\u00b711 inches at Bhuj to 24\u00b712 inches at M\u00e1ndvi. On the whole, except in Bhuj, where water and fodder were scarce, it was sufficient, crops were good, and millet prices fell from 29\u00bd to 32\u00bd pounds. During this year, the want of a responsible minister caused much confusion. There was a considerable improvement in the working of the J\u00e1deja court.\n\nIn 1874, though the rainfall, 13\u00b730 inches, was sufficient, it was too soon over, the crops suffered, and millet prices slightly fell to 34 pounds. Mr. Laxuman Krishn\u00e1ji was chosen minister; and except that the relations between the R\u00e1o and the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d were still strained and unsettled, the affairs of the state were well managed.\n\nIn 1875, the rainfall was short, 7\u00b721 inches, the harvest was poor, millet prices rose from 34 to 32\u00bd pounds, and nearly 50,000 people are said to have left in search of work. Besides of grain, there was a scarcity of fodder and water. In October the R\u00e1o, who had for some time been in bad health, went to Bombay to do homage to His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales. In Bombay his sickness increased and after his return he continued to grow weaker till his death on the 1st of January 1876. As his son, the present R\u00e1o, was only ten years of age, a Regency of four members under the Presidency of the Political Agent was appointed.\n\nIn 1876, the rainfall averaging 12 inches was sufficient, and though in the west locusts did some slight damage, the crops were on the whole fair. Millet prices remained steady at about 32\u00bd pounds. The Regency consisting of the Political Agent, the minister, a J\u00e1deja chief, and a M\u00e1ndvi merchant were installed. By the death of the merchant the number was soon after reduced to three. During the year, the R\u00e1o's sister was married to the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja of Bik\u00e1n\u00e9r, an event of importance as the first occasion on which a daughter of the Cutch house had been united to a R\u00e1jput\u00e1na chief. The marriage festivities, held at a cost of about \u00a340,000 (Rs. 4,00,000), prevented the R\u00e1o from being present at the great Delhi ceremonial. In honour of the proclamation, a Darb\u00e1r was held at Bhuj on January 1st. The Presidency of the J\u00e1deja court was transferred from the Political Agent to the minister, and the courts of the minister and assistant minister were amalgamated with it.\n\nIn 1877, the rainfall, 16\u00b762 inches, though sufficient, was unseasonable. The early crops failed, and though the cold weather harvest was good, millet prices rose from 32\u00bd to 17 pounds, and the poorer classes suffered severely. To lessen the distress, half of the grain dues were remitted and relief was given by opening works on the Tuna and Anj\u00e1r, and on the M\u00e1ndvi and Bhuj roads. The young R\u00e1o, who is being taught at Bhuj under the supervision of the Political Agent and his Assistant, made good progress. In November 1877 he was, in full Darb\u00e1r, presented by Sir Richard Temple the Governor of Bombay, with a Delhi banner. During the year a merchant was chosen to fill the place in the Council of Regency. To improve the management, the country was distributed over eight sub-divisions, each under a revenue and judicial officer, with separate police and village organization. Efforts were made to ascertain the\nmineral and other resources of the state, and measures taken with the view of developing trade and fostering local industries. The great M\u00e1ndvi pier and breakwater were begun, the work proving of great service in employing labour. The two leading difficulties in the management of the state are disputes with the Morvi state of K\u00e1thi\u00e1war on foreshore and other rights over the gulf of Cutch, and the long-standing jurisdiction difficulty between His Highness the R\u00e1o, and the leading members of the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d.\n\nChapter VII.\nHistory.\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nLAND ADMINISTRATION.\n\nChapter VIII. The lands of Cutch belong to two main classes, the state, kh\u00e1l\u1e63a, lands, the property of His Highness the R\u00e1o, and the cadet, bh\u00e1y\u00e1d, lands, in the hands of younger branches of the R\u00e1o's family. The state land is held mostly on an occupancy, buta, tenure. Under this, so long as he tills the ground properly and pays his rent, the holder keeps the land at a fixed rate without fear of being turned out. If the holder fails to pay the rent or is guilty of waste or want of care, the state can force him to give up his holding. But so long as he keeps to these conditions, one cultivator can hand over his land to another. A second form of tenure is by cash payment, sukhd\u00ed, under which the cultivator holds land for a fixed number of years. Patches of state, kh\u00e1l\u1e63a, land are also held on religious, dharm\u00e1la; service, p\u00e1ik pra\u017eia; and reward, passa, grants. The dharm\u00e1la lands are made over to temples, mosques, and other religious institutions for divine service or for charity. During good behaviour and submission to the state's orders, the grantees are generally left to manage their lands as they choose. Many villages in Cutch are held on this tenure. Service, p\u00e1ik pra\u017eia, land is given as payment for certain services, and is kept only so long as the service is performed. Reward, passa, lands are granted in return for some service done the state in time of danger or trouble.\n\nThe cadet, bh\u00e1y\u00e1d, lands are held on condition of fealty and allegiance to the central chief or over-lord, the R\u00e1o. About half of Cutch is held by these under-lords, chiefly the outlying parts, those to the east paying a small yearly tribute and those to the west paying nothing. Though these under-chiefs do not recognize occupancy rights in their ordinary tenants, the holders of charitable lands and a class of men called original owners, mulgir\u00e1si\u00e1s, are not liable to be turned out. In eastern V\u00e1gad under the Vaghela landlords, gir\u00e1si\u00e1s, and others, is a large class of Rajputs and Kol\u00eds, once holders of service land, who now in many villages practically pay a cash quit-rent. To pay his private debts, civil courts can attach the cultivator's share of his fields' produce, but his field tools and plough bullocks cannot be sold.\n\nLand Revenue. Land revenue is generally collected by the crop-division, bh\u00e1gbat\u00e1i, system. The only exception is, that in a few of the best cadet villages lands are for a short term of years let at a fixed money payment. In the state lands in some of the richer of the coast\nalluvial, k\u00e1nthi, villages cash rates were introduced in 1879. The state share of the crop varies from \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) to \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of the produce. The present rates were fixed in the time of Desalji the late R\u00e1o. In fixing the amount the chief considerations were the quality of the land, the rainfall, the water supply, and the character of the cultivator. In cadet, bh\u00e1y\u00e1d, or landlord, gir\u00e1sia, villages the proprietor generally takes more than the state share, the amount rising in some cases to one-half of the produce including fodder, and averaging from ten to fifteen per cent above the state share. Besides the crop-share there are many minor land cesses, of which the chief are a horse cess, ghoda vero, a produce cess, kangari, a watchman's fee, choki, a cash rate, varad, and an alienation cess, shedhavar. From the tillers of a few lands a fine is levied, because they do not hold the occupancy right to the land. Besides the rent due to the state, darb\u00e1r, or to his landlord, gir\u00e1sia, the cultivator has always to make certain payments to religious and charitable establishments and to village servants. These in the state villages are made from the cultivator's share of the produce and in cadet villages from the common heap.\n\nFormerly the land revenue was realized by a system of farming, the farmers not being allowed to levy more than the share, bh\u00e1g, in force at the time. In 1877-78 the Council of Regency gave up the farming system and began to collect the revenue departmentally. The staff employed in collecting the revenue is, over a group of from thirty to 134 villages, an officer styled manager, vahivatd\u00e1r, on monthly pay varying from \u00a36 9s. to \u00a310 11s. (250 - 400 koris), who has under him some agents, k\u00e1rkuns. Each village or small group of villages has its accountant, dhru or tal\u00e1ti, and its messenger, hav\u00e1ld\u00e1r. All subordinate revenue establishments are under the orders of a revenue commissioner, who is aided by an assistant. Both these officers move about the country during the greater part of the year, and supervise the work of local managers. Just before harvest the cultivator goes to the village accountant, dhru, and asks leave to cut his crop. The accountant sends word to the manager, vahivatd\u00e1r, who fixes a day, when under the supervision of the Government messenger, hav\u00e1ld\u00e1r, the cultivator may cut the standing corn. When cut, the corn is heaped in the village grain yard, a separate stall being kept for each cultivator, where his different sorts of grain are stored separately. At such time the messenger and his subordinates keep strict watch at the grain yard and at the village entrance, that no corn is pilfered or taken away on the sly. When the produce of all the fields is gathered in the yard, the state share is portioned out in the presence of the manager, vahivatd\u00e1r, or his chief clerk, the accountant, dhru, the weighman, and the other village officials. The cultivator parcels out the whole into a number of small heaps, and the manager choosing out of it the state share, it is taken away and piled on the great heap, ganj. The great heap, ganj, if not sold in advance, is taken to Bhuj, and either sold or stored in the state granary, koth\u00e1r. In some rare cases when the cultivator and the manager, vahivatd\u00e1r, agree to the price, the standing corn is estimated at a certain weight, and the state, darb\u00e1r, share taken according to the calculation. Formerly the accountant, messenger, and others employed in\ncollecting the revenue had each, as a perquisite, a certain fixed measure of grain. Now the state recovers their former shares and pays them by monthly money salaries. A revenue survey of the state lands is now in progress. To encourage the digging of wells the state makes a grant of from \u00a31 6s. to \u00a32 (Rs. 13-20) for every additional water-bag that a cultivator can work, and other improvements are encouraged by the grant of advances, tak\u00e1vi, at moderate rates of interest.\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nJUSTICE.\n\nFormerly (1854) within their own estates, the petty chiefs took cognizance of disputes, thefts, and other minor offences, and except that quarrels between proprietors and such serious crimes as murder went before the Darb\u00e1r, their powers were little, if at all, interfered with. V\u00e1gad, though the chiefs had jurisdiction over their own people, was to some extent an exception. In Abd\u00e1sa murder and other serious offences came, in the first instance, before the chiefs on whose estate they occurred, but in V\u00e1gad, serious cases were first inquired into by the Agency police, and then handed over to the Darb\u00e1r. In villages belonging to the R\u00e1o, the revenue officers took cognizance of petty offences, reporting the more serious to the Darb\u00e1r, where they were personally dealt with by the R\u00e1o, depositions being taken and read to the party or parties concerned. Civil cases were either heard in the R\u00e1o\u2019s presence, or investigated by one of his courts, panch\u00e1yats, of which there were two, composed of the members of the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d and other respectable officials. For most offences the usual punishment was fine, with imprisonment when the fine could not be paid. The improvement of the administration of justice was a subject to which the late R\u00e1o paid much attention, and under his rule several changes were made. In 1869 civil and criminal procedure codes, on the model of those in force in British districts, were introduced. These codes are at present (1879) under revision.\n\nThere are now three classes of courts in the province; those with jurisdiction in the R\u00e1o\u2019s domain only, those with jurisdiction in the estates of petty chiefs, and those whose power extends over the whole province. In the R\u00e1o\u2019s villages revenue and judicial powers have to a certain extent been separated, and for the sake of efficiency and proper supervision the province has been formed into eight sub-divisions, t\u00e1luk\u00e1s, each under the judicial charge of a subordinate judge, ny\u00e1y\u00e1dhish. All of these officers have both civil and criminal, and three of the eight, those stationed at Bhach\u00e1u, Mundra, and Lakhp\u00e1t, have in addition, revenue powers. They are divided into two classes, the first with, in criminal matters power to imprison for one year and fine up to \u00a325 (Rs. 250) and to try civil suits up to \u00a3125 (Rs. 1250) in value; the second able to try civil suits up to \u00a350 (Rs. 500) and in criminal matters imprison for three months, and fine up to \u00a36 (Rs. 60). Of the eight subordinate judges, five, at R\u00e9par, Anj\u00e1r, Bhuj, M\u00e1ndvi, and Abd\u00e1sa are first class, and three, at Bhach\u00e1u, Mundra, and Lakhp\u00e1t are second class. Besides the judges, three commandants of posts, th\u00e1nd\u00e1rs, at Khadir, Kh\u00e1vda, and Nakhtr\u00e1na exercise second class powers. Over these\ndistrict courts, is the High Court, varisht ad\u00e1lat, with one judge, who is also deputy minister, n\u00e1ib diw\u00e1n, and one assistant judge. It hears appeals from, and original cases beyond the powers of, the district courts, and in addition the cases of the guarantee holders according to the settlement of 1872. Thus the varisht ad\u00e1lat has practically two sides kh\u00e1lsa and j\u00e1deja, and exercises full civil and criminal jurisdiction throughout the province, sentences of death, transportation for life, and fourteen years imprisonment being subject to confirmation by the Council of Regency. The first judge presides over the j\u00e1deja side of the court, besides doing the more important work of the kh\u00e1lsa side, of which the lighter work devolves on the assistant judge. The courts in the territory under subordinate chiefs are the landholders\u2019 courts of which details are given below under the head \u201cJ\u00e1deja Court\u201d. Appeals from the decisions of the varisht ad\u00e1lat are heard by the Diw\u00e1n\u2019s Court, which is presided over by the Diw\u00e1n. Cases considered by him of special importance are reserved by the Diw\u00e1n for disposal by the Council of Regency.\n\nIn 1877-78, exclusive of cases brought in the courts of proprietors and petty chiefs who keep no record of proceedings, 4852 suits were filed. This with 1668 cases in arrears gave a total of 6520 for decision. Of these, in the course of the year, 5871 were settled, leaving 649 in arrears. Of 1266 appeals, 1123 were disposed of and 143 left on the files. The total value of suits on the files was \u00a337,542 8s. (Rs. 3,75,424).\n\nUnder the system of registration introduced in 1878, persons acquiring immovable property and wishing to have its transfer recognized, produce their deeds before the subordinate judges, ny\u00e1y\u00e1dhishes, who, on payment of certain fees, take copies of deeds and give certificates that they have been copied.\n\nIn 1854 V\u00e1gad was the only district with a systematic police. Under the Assistant Political Agent was a troop of irregular horse consisting of 4 jam\u00e1d\u00e1rs, 7 dafed\u00e1rs, 93 horsemen, 1 mehta, 2 messengers, 3 bh\u00edstis, and 6 horse boys, the whole paid by the R\u00e1o. Of this body one native officer and between twenty and thirty horsemen were, for police purposes, stationed in V\u00e1gad. With the native officer was a Gujar\u00e1t\u00ed writer, who made a record of complaints and proceedings, and submitted them to the Assistant Political Agent, and he forwarded them to the R\u00e1o with on each case an endorsement of what seemed necessary. Posts of horsemen were stationed in eleven villages, and the native officer and writers moving about were ready to aid any party in want of help. This system, helped by the isolated position of V\u00e1gad, made it most difficult for criminals to escape, and ensured a high degree of safety of person and property. In 1872, on the representation of the Political Agent, the R\u00e1o appointed a special officer to reorganize the police, and in 1873 an efficient and properly equipped force was established over the whole of the R\u00e1o\u2019s territory. For all state villages police headmen, patels, were appointed. In 1876 formal deeds, sanads, were granted investing the patels with the powers and privileges of village headmen. At the same time simple rules were drawn up\nfor their guidance, and the holders of service land, pas\u00e1ita, were declared liable for duty as village police. A small body of water police, organized in 1877, has proved very useful in looking after the discipline of merchant vessels, in preventing and detecting sea crime, and in helping boats in distress. The whole land police force includes three divisions, each distributed over a certain number of posts, th\u00e1n\u00e1s. At the head is the Police Commissioner with an assistant in the troublesome district of V\u00e1gad and an inspector in Abd\u00e1s\u00e1. In addition to his general control the Commissioner has special charge of the central districts. Under the Commissioner's supervision each district has its rural chief constable, faujd\u00e1r, and each chief town its city chief constable, kotv\u00e1l. In 1877 the strength of the force was 232 mounted and 412 foot police, and the total cost was \u00a39578 12s. (Rs. 95,786). The men are regularly drilled and when not on duty are allowed to attend night schools. Freed by the presence of a detachment of British troops from the fear of any foreign foe or unruly subject, the Cutch state has for years been almost entirely without a regularly organized military force. The establishment consisted of a body of Musalm\u00e1n horse, with a nominal strength of ninety-five, and an Arab militia, sib\u00e1ndi, 500 strong. The Musalm\u00e1n horse, who received in pay about \u00a31400 (Rs. 14,000) a year, were in 1876 found utterly unfit for actual service. Out of ninety-five barely thirty were forthcoming. In consequence of this it was arranged with their leaders that they should furnish a reduced number of effective horsemen. The Arabs of the militia, though useful as sentinels were unwilling to obey rules or submit to discipline, and they were too lazy and proud to discharge ordinary police duties. This body has (1877-78) been reformed and reduced to 300. Those who had not settled in Cutch were paid a gratuity and induced to return to their native land.\n\nIn 1877, against 1098 in the year before, 2063 offences were reported to the police. Of 3849 persons arrested 3189 were sent for trial. The courts dealt with 7151 persons against 5208 in the previous year. Of these 1226 were discharged, 2468 acquitted, 3313 convicted, and 132 remained untried at the close of the year. Of 253 appeals, in 96 the original sentence was confirmed, in 74 it was modified, and in 17 reversed. In 16 cases further inquiry was ordered, and 24, most of them questions of compensation, remained unheard.\n\nThe following statement shows the amount of property stolen and recovered during the four years ending 1877-78:\n\n**Cutch Police. \u2014 Property Stolen and Recovered, 1874-1877.**\n\n| Year | Kh\u00e1lsa territory | Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d territory | Total | Kh\u00e1lsa territory | Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d territory | Total | Percentage |\n|------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|------------|\n|      | \u00a3               | \u00a3               | \u00a3     | \u00a3               | \u00a3               | \u00a3     |            |\n| 1874-75 | 618           | 2639           | 3257  | 327             | 301             | 628   | 59\u00b79       |\n| 1875-76 | 2387          | 2300           | 4687  | 1010            | 482             | 1492  | 42\u00b733      |\n| 1876-77 | 3413          | 2103           | 5516  | 1683            | 517             | 2200  | 49\u00b725      |\n| 1877-78 | 2954          | 557            | 3511  | 1438            | 165             | 1601  | 48\u00b75       |\n\nCrime.\nSince the earliest British connection with Cutch the province has borne a bad name as the part of western India where child murder was most commonly practised.\\(^1\\) Besides the J\u00e1deja tribe, at once the most powerful in the province and the most thorough-going murderers of their children, the custom prevailed among several smaller Rajput and Musalm\u00e1n clans, the Hothis, Ded\u00e1s, Mokalsis, Phuls, Dals, Varamsis, Jh\u00e1r\u00e1s, Butt\u00e1s, B\u00e1r\u00e1chs, Pi\u00e1s, Chhagars, Kanaddes, Kers, \u00c1mars, V\u00e1n\u00e1n\u00e1s, Bhimanis, and Verars.\\(^2\\) Of the extent to which the practice was carried before the days of British interference no details are available. But it seems probable that, at least among the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s no female infants and not nearly all male infants were allowed to live.\\(^3\\) Child murder has, probably from very early times, been practised by the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s as by other Rajput tribes.\\(^4\\) In the case of the Cutch J\u00e1dej\u00e1s several circumstances combined to make the custom universal. The early conversion of the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s and other members of the Samma tribe to Isl\u00e1m lowered them in the eyes of the stancher Rajputs.\\(^5\\) And since then their loneliness, their pride, and their poverty made tribes hold aloof, who might otherwise have married with them.\\(^6\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The custom also prevailed among the K\u00e1thi\u00e1war and Mahi K\u00e1nta J\u00e1dej\u00e1s.\n\n\\(^2\\) Sir A. Burnes, Jour. R. A. Soc. I. 194. Capt. MacMurdo's list is slightly different: 'About 800 families of Muhammadans who claim J\u00e1deja descent, among them Venhs, Modhs, Dals, Kers, Hothis, Mokalsis, Jaisils, Varmsis, Jh\u00e1dhas, and Bh\u00fantas practise infanticide.' Trans. Bom. Lit. Soc. II. 243. Dr. Bh\u00e1u D\u00e1ji (Prize Essay on Female Infanticide 1844, p. 58,) adds Mi\u00e1n\u00e1s.\n\n\\(^3\\) The fact that female children have (1829) been found at all shows that our efforts have not been entirely fruitless. Sir A. Burnes, Jour. R. A. Soc. I. 198. Both Col. Tod (1823) (Western India, 475) and Sir A. Burnes (1829) (Jour. R. A. Soc. I. 198) were satisfied that boys as well as girls were killed. 'During upwards of a dozen reigns but one daughter of a R\u00e1o of Cutch escaped the ruthless pride of their sires.' Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 35.\n\n\\(^4\\) In a passage in the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1r\u00e1t, about 350 B.C. (V. de St. Martin, Geog. Grecque et Latine Sur l'Inde, 403) the Djarbik\u00eds and other Panj\u00e1b tribes are accused of murdering their children (Ditto, 402-410). It is said that all the Sam\u00e1s practised infanticide while they remained Hindus. (MacMurdo, Bom. Lit. Soc. Trans. II. 240). Jacquiermont (III. 397) found the practice among the Mairs and Rajputs of Meyw\u00e1r; its suppression by Mr. Duncan among the R\u00e1jkum\u00e1rs is well known, and its commonness Col. Tod admits. (R\u00e1jasth\u00e1n, I. 548.) According to McLennan (Primitive Marriage, 138, 165) the origin of female infanticide, common among savages everywhere, is referable to the primeval time of struggle and necessity when, as less capable of self-support, female infants were allowed to perish. Though infanticide may generally be traced to a primal state of strife the case of the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s shows that, late in a tribe's history, circumstances unconnected with strife, may arise to make general, if not to introduce the practice.\n\n\\(^5\\) The leading cause of the universality of the practice among J\u00e1dej\u00e1s is their loss of caste by intermarrying with Musalm\u00e1ns. The owner of an acre of land, whether Sisodia, R\u00e1thod, or Ch\u00f3h\u00e1n, would scorn the hand of a J\u00e1deja princess. Tod's R\u00e1jasth\u00e1n, I. 549. Dr. Bh\u00e1u D\u00e1ji (Infanticide, 1844, 42) adds, to the list of scorers, \u00c1vda, Chud\u00e1sma, A'hla, Mahida, Parm\u00e1r, Sarvaiya, and V\u00e1gheha Rajputs.\n\n\\(^6\\) Western India, 474-477. Of poverty, Capt. MacMurdo (Trans. Bom. Lit. Soc. I. 240) says, a very popular opinion is that child murder began in the want of means to procure becoming marriages. Of pride, in the same passage, he says there is a feeling of pride connected with the practice, for a J\u00e1deja conceives it a loss of character that his daughter should wed any man. So Mrs. Postans (1837), who traces it all to 'fiendish pride': 'The J\u00e1deja considers it a loss of character when his daughter marries, for no man is his equal' (Cutch, 145). The right of destroying their daughters, says Col. Walker (1805), grew into a privilege which they regarded as a distinction peculiar to their caste. (Bom. Gov. Sel. XXXIX. 324, 325). Their want of neighbours must always have increased the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s' difficulty in getting matches for their daughters. Strangers came reluctantly as they could generally find wives nearer home and thus save the trouble and expense of a long journey. (Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 64, 65). Among isolated Rajputs, says Col. Tod, the practice is fourfold greater from the difficulty of getting husbands for their daughters. R\u00e1jasth\u00e1n, I. 549.\nAccording to J\u00e1deja tradition the custom dates from about the middle of the twelfth century.\\(^1\\) Of the story of its origin there seem to be two versions, one tracing it to J\u00e1deja pride, the other to J\u00e1deja unpopularity. According to the pride theory, either Vira or Halla, two brothers seventh in descent from J\u00e1m Unar (12th century) had seven daughters. To find husbands for these girls the family priest was sent to all the neighbouring tribes. Failing in his search he came back declaring that no man was fit to marry a Samma. Hearing this the daughters vowed that rather than burden or disgrace their family they would die satis. The priest tried to dissuade them, but their father was willing, and choosing a less scrupulous Br\u00e1hman the sacrifice was made and the family honour saved.\\(^2\\) According to the unpopularity theory, at the marriage of the daughter of Halla to the chief of Umarkot a fight arose and the prince of Umarkot and 10,000 of his men were slain. His bride joined the Sumra satis, and as she went to the funeral pyre cursed her father's house, praying that every J\u00e1deja's daughter might prove barren and sickly. Since then, says the bard, no one is willing to marry a J\u00e1deja girl.\\(^3\\)\n\nThe child's life was generally taken by giving it milk drugged with opium, or it was smothered by drawing the umbilical cord over the face, or it was left to die of weakness or of want of care.\\(^4\\) When a girl was born the father was seldom told, all he heard was that his wife had been delivered and that the child was in heaven. On this he bathed and nothing more was said. Sometimes the mother refused to take the babe's life. Then the father was called, and unless, which was rare, his heart softened, he vowed neither to enter the house nor eat till the child was dead. Shrinking from it at first, women soon approved of the custom and when old were keener than the men that no girl's life should be spared. According to Hindu custom the body of the child was privately buried.\\(^5\\)\n\nThe commonness of child murder in Cutch was first in 1804 brought to the notice of Government by Captain Seton, then on a political mission at the R\u00e1o's court.\\(^6\\) In 1807 Colonel Walker tried to bring Fateh Muhammad to exert himself to put down the practice. But he pleaded that the custom was from God and should not be interfered with.\\(^7\\) The subject was prominently discussed in 1816,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Tod's Western India, 477.\n\n\\(^2\\) Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 34, 35. Col. Walker's version (Bom. Gov. Sel. XXXIX, 323-324) differs only in making the number of victims one instead of seven and in blaming the father for letting slip chances of marriage, insisting on too perfect a husband for his daughter. According to another account (Ditto, 363) their Muhammadan conquerors demanded the J\u00e1deja chiefs' daughters in marriage. This they evaded stating that in their caste daughters were not allowed to live. Then, fearful that the untruth would be found out, and trusting to the promise of their family priests that the guilt should be on their heads, they murdered their daughters.\n\n\\(^3\\) Tod's Western India, 475.\n\n\\(^4\\) Bom. Gov. Sel. XXXIX. 330. Captain MacMurdo (1818) says a little opium on the nipple or the finger, drowning in a basin of milk, or laying the placenta in its mouth, Trans. Bom. Lit. Soc.

In 1819 Captain McMurdo describes female infanticide as universal among the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s. He estimated that among that tribe about 1000 girls were killed every year, and that in the whole province there were not sixty, probably not more than thirty, girls alive. The few that had been spared belonged to Vaishnavite or Musalm\u00e1n families. In the next year (1819) one of the chief reasons for the extreme leniency of the terms of the treaty was the hope that the R\u00e1o and smaller chiefs would exert themselves to put a stop to infanticide. The R\u00e1o engaged that in his family the custom should cease, and the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d entered into a written agreement that any case of infanticide in their families should be punished jointly by the British Government and the R\u00e1o. This agreement would seem to have remained almost a dead letter. In 1823 Colonel Tod learned on good authority that though more pains were taken to hide it, the practice had not at all become less common. He heard and believed that boys as well as girls were put to death. In the same year, Mr. Gardiner, the Resident, reported some successes in the attempts to save life. But the success was small, for in 1826 a census of twenty-five V\u00e1gad villages showed about six boys to one girl. Nor was this the whole evil. Chiefs had rarely more than one son and probably killed male as well as female children. A further census taken in 1828 showed that in 112 villages, in different parts of Cutch, of 959 children, 815 were boys and 144 girls. This though unsatisfactory was a slight advance. In 1830 Sir J. Malcolm, Governor of Bombay, feared that the great sacrifices that had been made in the hope of abolishing infanticide had proved somewhat fruitless. He warned the chiefs that the English nation hated the crime, and that by continuing to practise it they ran the risk of losing British support. In 1834 on assuming the government, the young R\u00e1o Desalji took a fresh paper from the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d who again promised to give up the practice or to abide the full consequences. This had little effect. In 1839 the Resident Captain Melville wrote that female infanticide was practised to a lamentable extent, and that very little had as yet been done to put it down. In the J\u00e1deja population of 12,000 adult males, it was hard to find 500 females born in Cutch. Except the R\u00e1o, not one of the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s had any wish that the practice should\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 34-36.  \n2 Trans. Bom. Lit. Soc.

Tod thought that until some limit was put to the custom of sharing family estates nothing could be done to stop the murder of children (488). In Rajput\u00e1na Jay Sing of Amber tried to put down the practice by limiting the amount of dowries. But the vanity of his chiefs led them to break through his rule.

Mrs. Postans (1837, Cutch, 144-151) speaks of girl murder among the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s as if it was universal. Her figures, 8000 J\u00e1dej\u00e1s and 30 girls, are those of 1818.\ncease. In this year a case was proved and the offender fined. In 1840, at the R\u00e1o's request, the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s executed a deed binding themselves to prepare a true yearly return of their numbers, to report all premature and still births, to send early news of any child murder, and in default to be fined, the fines going to form a fund in aid of the marriage of poor J\u00e1dej\u00e1s. A census taken in the same year showed 2625 male and 335 female children of J\u00e1deja origin or about one girl to seven boys. In 1841 the R\u00e1o who did his utmost to put down the practice issued a proclamation, requiring under severe penalties all tribes akin to the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s to abstain from the crime, and later on in the same year, as a case of infanticide was proved against one of them, the Hothi tribe were required to sign similar engagements. At the same time rewards were offered for information. In 1844 the J\u00e1deja chiefs, summoned by the Political Agent, acknowledged their failure to keep their promise and meet the wishes of the British Government, and entered into a further agreement, afterwards renewed in 1846, engaging to entertain midwives, to report and keep birth and death registers, to take notice of all premature births, and if an infant died to have the cause certified by two or three respectable persons. These stricter rules were not without some result. During the five years ending 1847, the proportion of females to males had risen from one in eight to one in five. In April 1848 Government drew attention to the failure of the chiefs to report cases of crime, and suggested heavier penalties for the breach of this and other engagements. At the same time to help the poorer J\u00e1dej\u00e1s in marrying their daughters, a fund was established by a yearly subscription of \u00a3400 (Rs. 4000) from the British and an equal amount from the Cutch Government. The census of 1852 showed a proportion of one in four. In 1854 a staff of three writers was engaged to go round to all J\u00e1deja villages and, making a list of births, marriages, and deaths, to compile the whole on their return to Bhuj, bringing any suspicious cases to the notice of Government. Since then no fresh measures have been introduced. Suggestions to lower marriage expenses and to widen the circle within which J\u00e1deja girls can marry, have hitherto had little effect.\n\nThe 1873 census showed, exclusive of the wives of the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s, who belonged to other Rajput tribes, 4272 J\u00e1deja females and 8371 males or about one female to two males. Still constant care was wanted to prevent infanticide from again becoming common. In 1873 the death rate among female infants rose, 188 out of 373 dying compared with 72 out of 384 among male infants. In some villages child murder was still unchecked. In the Abd\u00e1sa town of Nalia every female infant was systematically put to death. During eleven years, of thirty-nine female infants only five had lived, while of forty-nine boys only ten had died. Since 1874 with unceasing care steady progress has been made. During the last sixty years the all but universal practice has fallen into such disuse that the 1877 census showed among the whole J\u00e1deja population 8672 males and\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Sel.

In the same year the Cutch infanticide fund amounted to \u00a37990 (Rs. 79,900) of which \u00a3538 (Rs. 5380) were given to help poor J\u00e1dej\u00e1s in marrying their daughters.\u00b9\n\nJails.\n\nOf eleven recognized places for confining prisoners ten are lock-ups, and one at Bhuj, for cases of more than one month's imprisonment, is a large well managed jail with room for 300 inmates. In 1877 the eleven jails held altogether 2824 prisoners or a daily average of 201. The prisoners in the Bhuj jail, under the superintendence of a jailor and staff, are chiefly employed in weaving tapes, towels, and rough white, chot\u00e1ra, cloth. In 1877 the total cost was \u00a31143 (Rs. 11,430) or an average of \u00a35 (Rs. 50) to each prisoner.\n\nJ\u00e1deja Court.\n\nThe J\u00e1deja court is a special Cutch institution. Under the presidency of the deputy minister, n\u00e1ib diw\u00e1n, its business is conducted by a bench of four J\u00e1deja nobles, members of the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d, and chosen by His Highness the R\u00e1o. This special court owes its origin to the guarantee granted by the British Government to the J\u00e1deja chiefs under the terms of the treaty of 1819. At first, neither the persons included under the guarantee nor the nature or scope of the guarantee was fixed. It has only been after a course of inquiry and discussion lasting over nearly sixty years, that a settlement has (1878) been made. This settlement fixes the number of guarantee holders at 139,\u00b2 and as regards their civil and criminal powers in their own estates arranges them into four classes. The first class, holders of more than fifteen villages, have full civil powers, and in criminal matters jurisdiction up to cases involving seven years imprisonment or a fine of about \u00a3158 (6000 koris); the second class of holders, with more than five villages, have power to settle civil cases up to about \u00a3263 (10,000 koris) in value, and criminal cases up to two years imprisonment or \u00a352 (2000 koris) fine; the third class, with more than one village, have civil jurisdiction up to \u00a352 (2000 koris), and criminal up to three months' imprisonment and \u00a37 16s. (300 koris) fine; and the fourth class, owners of one village, have civil powers up to \u00a35 (200 koris), and power to imprison for fifteen days or fine \u00a31 6s. (50 koris). Except that, with the concurrence of the Political Agent, the R\u00e1o has power to call for and quash any proceedings that are shown to be unjust, no appeal lies in criminal matters from a first class holder in cases involving a maximum sentence of three month's imprisonment or \u00a35 4s. (200 koris) fine, or from a second class holder from a maximum sentence of one month's imprisonment, or \u00a32 12s.

Of the fifteen, one, the Th\u00e1kor of Morvi, is in the first, five are in the third, and nine are in the fourth class.\u00b9\n\nIt is the work of the J\u00e1deja court to hear civil and criminal cases, arising on the estates of guarantee holders and beyond their powers; and cases in which a guarantee holder is concerned, or in which one or both of the parties live on a guarantee holder's estate. Sentences of death, transportation for life, or fourteen years imprisonment are subject to confirmation by His Highness the R\u00e1o. Appeals from the decisions of jurisdiction holders lie to the J\u00e1deja court in all cases above their final jurisdiction. From the J\u00e1deja court an appeal lies to the R\u00e1o, and from him to Government, if the matter in dispute is the land or revenue of a guarantee holder. Boundary disputes in which a guarantee holder is a party are decided by the J\u00e1deja court with an appeal to the R\u00e1o, and a further appeal to Government if the party dissatisfied is a guarantee holder. Boundary cases in which the R\u00e1o is a party, are decided by the J\u00e1deja court with an appeal to Government.\n\nThe following summary of the different phases through which, between 1819 and 1879, the question of the rights and duties of guarantee holders has passed, has been prepared by Colonel L. C. Barton, who, as Political Agent, (1877-78) took a leading part in removing the last difficulties that stood in the way of a final settlement.\u00b2\n\nThe ruling principle of the different sub-divisions of the great Rajput race is that all the sons of a chief must be provided for out of the family estate. The case is well put in the following passage in Tod's R\u00e9jasth\u00e1n.\u00b3 'In all large estates the chief must provide for his sons or brothers, according to his means. In an estate worth from \u00a36000 to \u00a38000 (Rs. 60,000 - 80,000) a year, the second brother might have a village yielding a yearly rent of from \u00a3300 to \u00a3500 (Rs. 3000 - 5000). This is his patrimony, b\u00e1po\u1e6d\u1e6da, and this he may increase by good service at the court of his sovereign or abroad. Juniors share in proportion. These again sub-divide and have their little roll of dependents. The extent to which sub-division is carried in some Rajput estates is ruinous to the protection and general welfare of the country. It is pursued in some parts until there is actually nothing left sufficiently large to share, or to furnish subsistence for one individual.' Consequently a great deprivation of services to the state ensues, especially in the isolated lordships, th\u00e1kor\u00e1ts, scattered over the country, as amongst the Cutch J\u00e1dej\u00e1s, the K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r tribes, and the small Gujar\u00e1t independencies bordering on the western Rajput states. In these\n\n\u00b9 Much of the material for this sketch is taken from Wyllie's 'R\u00e1o of Cutch and his Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d,' External Policy of India, 245 - 319. Col. Barton.\n\u00b2 Political Agent, 85, 9th May 1878.\n\u00b3 Vol. I. 173, 174.\ncountries the system of minute sub-division is termed Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d or brotherhood, synonymous to the French tenure by fr\u00e9rage. 'Give me my share,' says the Rajput when he reaches manhood; and thus they go on clipping and paring till all are impoverished. The divisibility of the Cutch and K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r fr\u00e9rage carried to the most destructive extent, is productive of litigation, crime, and misery. This custom and the difficulty of finding dowers for their daughters, are the two chief causes of Rajput infanticide.\n\nWhen in 1816 the British Government interfered in the affairs of Cutch, besides estates held by Rajputs of other tribes, between one-third and one-half of the entire area of the province had passed into the hands of the R\u00e1o's brotherhood. During the reign of the mad R\u00e1o R\u00e1yadhan (1779-1814), and the struggles for power between Jam\u00e1d\u00e1r Fatch Muhammad and Diw\u00e1n Hansr\u00e1j, the J\u00e1deja Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d for the most part held aloof, living on their own estates and watching the course of events. When in 1814 the British Government found it necessary to interfere in order to check the anarchy which threatened to ruin the state, a proclamation was issued to the J\u00e1deja feudatories, assuring them that so long as they remained quiet, their rights and privileges would be respected. The effect of this promise was to raise the position and power of the members of the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d. When Captain MacMurdo had to choose a successor to R\u00e1yadhan, he consulted fifteen of the leading J\u00e1dej\u00e1s, and his choice fell on their nominee. And in 1819, when R\u00e1o Bh\u00e1rmalji was deposed, the succession was again in accordance with the votes of the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s. In return for the help given by the chiefs, they received under the terms of the treaty of 1819, a much better position than they had any right to expect. The deposition of R\u00e1o Bh\u00e1rmalji was made to rest, not upon his proved incapacity to govern, but upon the desire of the J\u00e1deja Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d. In the next article the Company acknowledged Desalji as R\u00e1o of Cutch, not by right of birth, but by election of the J\u00e1deja chiefs. In the fourth article the J\u00e1deja Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d, as at the time the sole depositary of power, determined with the Honourable Company's advice that a regency should be formed. When, under the sixth article the Company agreed to leave a British force in Cutch, this concession was made at the desire of R\u00e1o Shri Desalji and the J\u00e1deja Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d, and, as though the normal Government of Cutch were not a despotism but a limited monarchy, funds for the payment of the force were guaranteed by the same R\u00e1o Shri Desalji and the J\u00e1deja Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d. Again in the fourteenth article, providing the British Government with military aid from the Cutch state, a special clause was added to the effect that the arrangement was not to be considered to impose any duties on the J\u00e1deja Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d contrary to their established customs. Still more important were the tenth, sixteenth, and eighteenth articles. The tenth provided that the British Government should exercise no authority over the domestic concerns of the R\u00e1o, or those of any of the J\u00e1deja chieftains, and that the R\u00e1o, his heirs, and successors should be absolute masters of their territory. In the sixteenth the British Government guaranteed the J\u00e1deja chiefs of the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d, and generally all Rajput chiefs in Cutch, full.\nenjoyment of their possessions, and in the eighteenth they stipulated before conferring the guarantee, that the J\u00e1deja chiefs should enter into a written engagement to abstain from infanticide.\n\nThe result of this treaty was that the utmost advantages of British interference were secured to the J\u00e1deja chiefs, while the burdens inseparable therefrom were heaped on the R\u00e1o, then a minor of two or three years. In January 1821, the Honourable Mountstuart Elphinstone, Governor of Bombay, visited Cutch. He has left the following account of the relations between the R\u00e1o and the smaller chiefs. 'The R\u00e1o's ordinary jurisdiction is confined to his own demesne, each J\u00e1deja chief exercising unlimited authority within his own lands. The R\u00e1o can call on the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s to serve him in war, but must furnish them with pay at a fixed rate while they are with his army. He is the guardian of the public peace, and as such chastises all robbers and other general enemies. It would seem likewise that he ought to repress private war and decide all disputes between chiefs; but this prerogative, though constantly exerted, is not admitted without dispute. Each chief has a similar body of kinsmen, who possess shares of the original appanage of the family, and stand in the same relation of nominal dependence to him, that he bears to the R\u00e1o.'\n\nOf the condition of the chiefs Mr. Elphinstone observed: 'Some of them are reduced to poverty by the numerous sub-divisions of their estates, every younger brother being entitled to a share equal to one-third, and often to one-half of that of the elder, but on the whole, the number of estates that have descended to single heirs induces a suspicion that in Cutch infanticide is not confined to females.' In regard to the policy to be pursued by the Regency towards the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s, he laid down the following directions: 'It is necessary that the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s should be treated with attention and civility, and that care should be taken not to encroach on their privileges. The vigilance of the Resident should guard against the negligence, partiality, or corruption which may be evinced by the Regency in deciding on the quarrels of the chiefs. His authority should repress all attempts on their part to renew the practice of plunder or of private war, and his moderation should guard against the temptation of adding to the R\u00e1o's possessions by forfeiture even in cases where the resistance of a chief should have required the employment of military force. Great care should be taken to avoid any appearance of arrogance in our treatment of the J\u00e1deja chiefs; but I do not think there is any\n\n---\n\n1 Colonel Tod's account written two years later closely agrees with Mr. Elphinstone's. Of about 200 separate proprietors, fifty were of some consequence and thirteen, most of them the descendants of chieftains established before Khengar's time (1537), formed a select body of the highest rank. The R\u00e1o had the right to call on the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s for military service; but at the same time he had to give them a certain amount of pay. When a vassal J\u00e1deja died the R\u00e1o had the right to send a sword or turban to the heir; but this did not influence succession and was not acknowledged by any homage. The J\u00e1dej\u00e1s made no homage and paid no investiture fee except on the accession of the R\u00e1o, on his marriage, and on the birth of a prince. Grants, pat\u00e1s, by the R\u00e1o were full and for ever. The R\u00e1o had the right to hear disputed cases of sub-infeudations. But he should not decide such cases without the advice of the assembled council of state, the Bhay\u00e1d or brotherhood, in which every chieftain of note was included. Western India, 434-439.\nnecessity for referring political questions to the decision of their body, to the extent which a superficial view of the correspondence of the Residency would lead us to think usual. It is natural to suppose that the former R\u00e1os would consult the principal J\u00e1dej\u00e1s before they entered on any measure that required the cordial co-operation of the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d, and in the absence of an efficient sovereign, it is still more necessary that the Regency should learn the sentiment of that body, but it does not appear to be usual, or to be expected, or to be practicable that all should be assembled to give their votes even on the most important questions. The Resident should continue to consult the greatest chiefs separately or together, as he thinks best suited to the occasion, and may extend or confine the number according to the importance of the question; but I should think fifty or sixty the greatest number that need ever be consulted.\u00b9\n\nDuring the minority of R\u00e1o Desalji (1819-1834) the affairs of the state were managed by a Council of Regency, at the head of which was the British Resident. During the latter half of this period (1827-1834) the post was held by Major, afterwards Sir Henry, Pottinger, who, while in the main respecting the J\u00e1deja independence, steadily pursued a centralizing policy. Powers likely to interfere with the maintenance of public order, or with the policy of a good and strong government, were firmly but quietly taken out of their hands. They could no longer put their people to death, nor could they venture openly to disobey the direct orders of the Regency, acting for the Darb\u00e1r. Of the J\u00e1deja members of the Regency, Capt. Walter, Assistant Resident (February 1828), has left the following account: \u2018From the J\u00e1deja chiefs who are members of the Regency, no assistance has ever been derived. Considering the attainment of the commonest qualifications as beneath their dignity as Rajputs, they are as little adapted from their ignorance as it is foreign to their habits, to interfere or advise in the affairs of the R\u00e1o. On their own estates they evince the greatest ignorance of their own affairs; but during their customary residence at Bhuj, they appear to be solicitous of nothing else; and, without their own individual interests are concerned, neither an opinion nor judgment is ever expressed by them, excepting in cases where the ministers, wishing to give weight to their own proposals, bring the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s to assert their concurrence.\u2019\u00b2\n\nIn 1830, when Sir J. Malcolm, Governor of Bombay, visited Cutch he assembled the J\u00e1deja chiefs and soundly rebuked them for their bad return for the liberal treatment they had received eleven years before. \u2018Your lands,\u2019 he said, \u2018have been guaranteed to you and your descendants by the British Government without the stipulation of one cowry of pecuniary payment to it or to your Prince; and without fixing any specific aid of troops in the event of invasion, or of the public peace being disturbed. Since then you have allowed small and despicable bands of plunderers to traverse the country and carry off booty from the principal towns of your Prince. I\n\n\u00b9 Wyllie's External Policy of India, 265. \u00b2 Wyllie's External Policy of India, 267.\nhave desired the Resident and the minister to inform me of the name of any person that distinguished himself during the late Mi\u00e1na incursion, but not one name has been brought to my notice, and I find that a large body of Rajput chiefs, boasting the name of J\u00e1dej\u00e1s and of devoted allegiance to their ruler, considering themselves sheltered by our too generous guarantee from the just resentment of their Prince, made not one effort to protect his towns from plunder or his fields from devastation, apparently satisfied if they saved their own estates from similar evils, and in some instances it is strongly suspected that the exemption of these from attack was the price of a base, if not of a traitorous inactivity. This has passed; but let it be known in future, that there is nothing in the British guarantee that frees the chiefs from their allegiance, or from the aid they are bound to give their Prince. Any chief, who after this fails to exert himself to the utmost to oppose and destroy his (the R\u00e1o\u2019s) enemies or plunderers, will be dealt with as one who aids them, and shall, as the slightest punishment, be proclaimed to have forfeited all right to British protection.\u2019 \u2018The Resident,\u2019 Sir John added, \u2018has been instructed by me to communicate with all of you individually upon this subject, which is one of much importance for you fully to understand. He will explain to you the mode in which you can best fulfil obligations that belong to your condition, and which are not specified in any engagement or treaty, because they are implied as duties that can neither be evaded nor neglected without the total dissolution of those ties by which a Government like that of Cutch can alone be maintained under its present form and administration.\u2019\n\nIn the minute from which this extract is taken Sir John Malcolm thus sums up his views on the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d question. \u2018The chiefs of Cutch have encroached on their ruler till his revenue bears no just proportion to his condition as their head, and it should be a principle of our policy to take every fair advantage of events, to increase his power to the diminution of the depraved, disobedient, and unmanageable class of petty chiefs, whose existence in their actual state is at variance with all plans of improvement, and calculated to render unprofitable, if not to destroy, the alliance we have formed with this Principality.\u2019\n\nIn 1834, on attaining his majority, R\u00e1o Desalji signed a new treaty of which the chief stipulation was, that the Regency should end, and that he should be placed in charge of the government of his country, \u2018under the constitutional and established advice of his ministers and the J\u00e1deja Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d.\u2019\n\nIn the year 1842, a commission, of which Mr. Lumsden was President, was appointed for the purpose of determining the rights possessed by the chief of Morvi in V\u00e1gad in eastern Cutch. In this inquiry Mr. Lumsden defined the R\u00e1o\u2019s rights over his Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d to be: the right to summon the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d for military service, subject to the condition of subsisting them and their troops; the right to settle appeals from the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d in their disputes with one another; the right to recover stolen property or its value from any member of the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d into whose town it had been\ntraced; the control of all sea customs and other port dues; the right to collect certain trifling cesses from particular villages belonging to J\u00e1deja chiefs; the right, in cases of disobedience, to enforce his legitimate orders by billet, mohsal, or by military force. Three more rights were claimed by the R\u00e1o: to levy a subscription from the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d for public works; to place police posts in J\u00e1deja towns; and to saddle the estates of J\u00e1deja chiefs with the perpetual payment of certain religious grants. Of these three, Mr. Lumsden disallowed the first and considered the second doubtful; he admitted that the third was supported by some rare instances. 'Beyond these nine items, no other authority,' he wrote, 'was formerly exercised or is now claimed by the Darb\u00e1r.' Finally he considered that the right of the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d to exclusive civil and criminal jurisdiction within their own towns and territories was incontestable.\n\nIn the following year (1843) Mr. Lumsden became Political Agent in Cutch, and thus recorded his observations on the social system of the Cutch J\u00e1dej\u00e1s. 'It recognises a partition of jurisdiction as well as of land, but as this is incompatible with an efficient government, and indeed would speedily lead to anarchy, we find it modified by circumstances, and an uncertain scale of independence accompanying the possession of landed property. The representatives of all the great families throughout Cutch are called the til\u00e1ts. These in their turn have shared their rights, gir\u00e1s, with their younger brethren, and the latter again among their heirs. This minute sub-division of property and rights has led to the following results. Everywhere are numerous petty proprietors living in perfect independence, exercising in their own persons the civil and police authority elsewhere vested in the chief. In many cases younger branches, who have either equalled or surpassed the elder in wealth and influence, have come to be regarded by prescription as the representatives of distinct houses; while in others by a sort of family compact, they acknowledge and support the head of their house.'\n\nIn 1849 R\u00e1o Desalji sent in a formal protest against the article in the 1834 treaty, that declared he was to rule under the constitutional and established advice of his ministers and the Jadeja Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d. He based his argument on general principles, and stated that, as he was on good terms with his Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d, his motion was not caused by the pressure of any special circumstances. He stated that the general government of the province had always been carried on by the R\u00e1o's personal authority, and he requested that in cases where the Government guarantee was concerned, the R\u00e1o should act with the advice of his brethren; and that all other affairs should be conducted in accordance with the ancient usages of the province. Government refused to alter the treaty, on the ground that it concerned other than their own and the R\u00e1o's interests.\n\nMeanwhile the civil and criminal control of the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d over their several estates remained practically unchecked. The R\u00e1o seldom interfered, and in the absence of any judicial system very few cases came before his officials. As time went on disputes of various sorts\narose between the R\u00e1o and the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d. They were summarised in 1856 by the Political Agent, Colonel Jacob, who in his report to Government remarked that there were four general principles at stake; was the British Government, in vindication of the guarantee granted to the feudatories, under any obligation to check the R\u00e1o's systematic acquisition of claims by purchase or mortgage; had the R\u00e1o without the consent of his Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d, the right to promulgate laws applicable to the province at large; was the R\u00e1o entitled to issue billets, mohsals, on the vassals of his Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d; and to what extent could the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d enforce the power of advice reserved to them by the treaty of 1834. On all these points Colonel Jacob entertained opinions strongly adverse to the pretensions of the R\u00e1o.\n\nThe issues raised by Colonel Jacob were decided by Government (3242-A. of 14th August 1857) in the following manner. First, with regard to the R\u00e1o's acquiring claims on the estates of guaranteed chiefs, it was ruled that such claims could give him no right to encroach on the prerogative of the J\u00e1deja Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d, nor to appropriate their lands without their express consent, and that if he endeavoured to enforce any such pretension, the British Government would interfere and vindicate its guarantee. Secondly, it was decided that as the R\u00e1o, before the treaties of 1816 and 1819, had not the power to legislate for any except his own subjects, he was not, except with their consent, entitled now to transgress that bound and to legislate for the subjects of the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d; it was necessary to remind him, that section 16 of the treaty of 1819 secured to the chiefs, by the term 'full enjoyment of their possessions' the enjoyment of the privileges which such possessions conferred. Thirdly, as to billeting men on the chiefs' villages, the practice was declared contrary to the ancient constitution and customs of Cutch, and, in case of an appeal being received from any chief, could not be permitted by the British Government. Lastly, the right of advice secured to the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d by the treaty of 1834 was defined as rendering their consent necessary to any law intended to have force throughout the whole of Cutch, but as not binding the R\u00e1o to their views in matters which concerned his own prerogative.\n\nIn the following year, the order against the R\u00e1o's imposition of billets was modified. The Political Agent suggested that billets on vassals of guaranteed chiefs should be imposed through the chief, and in cases in which the R\u00e1o himself might be a party, a reference should, in the first instance, be made to the Agency, and this suggestion was approved by Government and the Secretary of State. But the R\u00e1o repudiated any limitation of his right, and dying soon after (1860) the question was left open.\n\nPr\u00e1gmalji, the next R\u00e1o, showed, before long, that he was determined to carry his prerogative further than his father. He questioned the jurisdiction of the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d over their own vassals, began to oust them from their estates by pecuniary accommodation, and asserted his right to impose billets not only on the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d but direct on their tenants. With regard to the last point, Government in their Resolution of 5th November 1863, doubted the\npropriety of allowing the R\u00e1o, except on very emergent occasions, to billet men on the chiefs.\n\nOn the 10th January 1865, the Political Agent in Cutch submitted a memorandum to Government, purporting to place clearly before them the whole subject of the relations between the R\u00e1o and his feudatories. He represented that the result of the British connection with Cutch had been immensely to increase the R\u00e1o's power. As an instance in point, he quoted the supervision over the infanticide operations which had given the R\u00e1o a desultory right to interfere in the internal affairs of the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d and other proprietors. The chiefs, he said, complained: that men were billeted on them not only by the R\u00e1o but by his subordinate officers; that without previous reference to them billets were placed on their tenants, not only by the R\u00e1o, but by his subordinate officers; that fines were imposed on them and their tenants by the R\u00e1o and his officers; that the R\u00e1o had levied a new tax called tablephan; that in V\u00e1gad the police had interfered in petty cases in which both plaintiff and defendant were tenants of the same proprietor; and that the R\u00e1o bought rights, g\u00far\u00e1s, from parties who were not competent to alienate them.\n\nOn these points the Political Agent requested orders. He suggested the necessity for a more exact definition of the particular chiefs or estates to which the sixteenth article of the treaty of 1819 was to be applied; he asked for instructions in regard to estates guaranteed at the date of the treaty, but which had since been broken up, or in which the R\u00e1o might have since acquired a direct interest; and he suggested that in accordance with the treaty of 1834, the council of the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d might be constituted a court to take cognizance of all matters connected with its own order, in other words of all cases involving the interests of the chiefs or their tenants.\n\nIn a further memorandum submitted on the 1st March 1865, the Political Agent laid down as premises, that the normal condition of the feudatories, within the limits of their own estates, was one of complete independence; that by the deeds of guarantee issued to them in 1819, the British Government were bound to preserve that independence; that it had allowed their independence to be infringed in many ways by the R\u00e1o; that by sub-division of property the majority of the land-holders were no longer fitted for the exercise of a completely independent jurisdiction; and that all Government could hope to secure them was a modified form of independence. He then proposed to define the limits of the R\u00e1o's legitimate jurisdiction over the guaranteed chiefs; to make out an authoritative list of the guaranteed chiefs; and to divide them into two classes, those fitted and those unfitting to exercise civil and criminal powers. The rights of the second class should, he proposed, be vested in a council of twelve of the brethren, sitting as a permanent court in Bh\u00faj, with the R\u00e1o or any chief named by him as President.\n\nOn the 25th August 1866, while these suggestions were under consideration, the R\u00e1o addressed a protest against the opinions and\nproceedings of the Political Agent. He described them as subversive of the prerogative which, by hereditary right and recognition of the British Government, was properly vested in the rulers of Cutch. He asserted that he had power to billet men all over Cutch, and that he had a reserved criminal jurisdiction in all serious matters. He admitted that civil suits were generally settled by local committees, but argued that an appeal lay to the R\u00e1o, and agreed that in important suits an appeal should also lie to the Political Agent. With reference to the guarantee he urged that all that was specifically guaranteed to the feudatories were their 'landed rights, gir\u00e1s,' and that it did not assure them the exercise of a civil and criminal jurisdiction incompatible with the supremacy of the head of the state.\n\nOn the papers thus submitted, the Political Secretary to the Government of Bombay drew up a note on the 10th October 1866. He was of opinion that the Political Agent in Cutch had overrated the extent of the guarantee granted to the chiefs by the treaty of 1819; and that it was not at all clear that Government had guaranteed them their independence in such a sense that it might not be interfered with in the cause of good government. Practically he suggested that the chiefs should be classified according to their ability to govern, and that after each chief had been assigned his proper jurisdiction, all remaining power should centre in the R\u00e1o. It was further suggested that a special officer of weight and standing should be deputed to Cutch, for the purpose of drawing up and submitting to Government the draft of a settlement of all disputed points connected with existing treaties and engagements.\n\nThe opinions of the Government of India on the whole subject were expressed in their letter 898 of the 6th September 1869. They considered that the chief object was to maintain existing relations between the R\u00e1o and the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d. The position of the British Government under the treaty of 1819 was that of suzerainty of the Cutch state; that while, therefore, it could not claim any civil and criminal jurisdiction in the peninsula, it reserved a certain power of general control, and more specifically bound itself in certain contingencies to interfere between the R\u00e1o and his chiefs; that article sixteen and the deeds of guarantee resulting from it conveyed no other rights than those enjoyed at the time by the several chiefs; they did not affect the rights of the R\u00e1o, or the feudal service which the chiefs were bound to render. Where rights had fallen into abeyance there was no call to resuscitate them; the exercise of rights likely to cause misrule was to be opposed; the R\u00e1o to be encouraged and strengthened in the full exercise of his legitimate powers; and care to be taken to avoid weakening his authority by any stretch of the guaranteed rights beyond their reasonable meaning.\n\nOn questions regarding the estates of the guaranteed chiefs, the Government of India considered that the R\u00e1o should have a council whom he would be bound to consult, and that if he acted contrary to their advice, the council, or the vassal whose interests were\naffected, should have the right of appeal to the Political Agent, whose decision, subject to the control of Government, should be final. As regards the jurisdiction of the chiefs the Government of India considered that a list should be prepared of those who by the extent of their estates were qualified to exercise administrative powers; the rest should be entitled to elect a representative member of the R\u00e1o's council.\n\nOn the 7th October 1867, the Political Agent forwarded heads of an arrangement, which he thought likely to fulfil the objects of the policy laid down by the Government of India. The arrangement was founded on proposals submitted by the R\u00e1o's Diw\u00e1n Mr. K\u00e1ji Sh\u00e1h\u00e1budin. As regards the suggestion of the Government of India, that the R\u00e1o should be helped by a council, the proposal was that there should be a committee, panch\u00e1y\u00e1t, under the presidency of the R\u00e1o to settle disputes between guaranteed proprietors; and that besides the R\u00e1o and his minister it should consist of three members, chosen by the votes of certain of the proprietors. As regards jurisdiction, the Cutch proposal was to arrange the chiefs in five classes with graduated civil and criminal powers.\n\nOn the 18th March 1868 the Government of Bombay submitted for the approval of the Government of India a draft agreement, by which it was proposed to define the jurisdiction and functions of the R\u00e1o and the guaranteed Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d. The suggestion of a council was accepted on all sides. As regards its functions it was proposed that they should not only advise in matters affecting the rights and possessions of guarantee holders, but should also act as a judicial authority, in order to control and supplement the guarantee holders' limited jurisdictions. Also that in the first instance the holders of civil and criminal powers should be classified on the joint consideration of their possessions and their character, a certain civil and criminal jurisdiction being assigned to each class, and all remaining jurisdiction being assigned to the R\u00e1o through the council. The rules themselves were designed, while acquitting the Government of an embarrassing guarantee, to provide a large part of Cutch with a local magistracy, and an independent court of justice.\n\nThey did not please the R\u00e1o. He thought they lessened his prerogatives and dignity, and submitted modifications for the consideration of Government to meet his views. Government (1297 of 16th May) amended the rules and desired the Political Agent to obtain the R\u00e1o's signature to the draft agreement. But the R\u00e1o made many objections, and requested that the Government of India might postpone the consideration of the question until his further observations had been received. Government declined to accede to his request, and having received the confirmation of the Government of India to the amended draft agreement, decided (1921 of 23rd July 1868) that the matter could not be re-opened. Against this decision the R\u00e1o energetically protested. He assured Government that he never could accept the proposed arrangement, and requested them in the event of their adhering to their decision, to instruct the Political Agent to receive charge of the administration until he had laid the case before the Secretary of State. After considering the\nR\u00e1o's protest, Government (2251 of 7th September 1868) agreed to await the orders of Her Majesty's Secretary of State. Meanwhile, in anticipation of final orders, the Political Agent was told to prepare a list of guarantee holders entitled to exercise jurisdiction or to vote in the election of the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d council. The R\u00e1o was to be invited to co-operate in preparing the lists.\n\nIn his letter of 16th September 1868, the Secretary of State approved the action of the Bombay Government, and hoped to hear that the R\u00e1o had given his assent to the draft agreement. Upon this the Government of Bombay (3395 of 5th December 1868) recorded that the terms of the draft agreement must be carried out as an authoritative decision of Government, so far only as they might be desired by the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d themselves. The Political Agent was therefore directed to summon the leading members of the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d, and to explain to them the terms of the draft agreement, and that the reserved jurisdiction was to be exercised by the R\u00e1o. The R\u00e1o was also to be invited to take part in the discussions, and if he declined to take his legitimate place in the council, the appellate jurisdiction was to be exercised by the Political Agent.\n\nThe R\u00e1o still determined to have nothing to do with the agreement, and sent his Diw\u00e1n K\u00e1ji Sh\u00e1h\u00e1budin to England to represent his case to the Secretary of State. He also arranged that the whole of the business connected with the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d and their possessions should be conducted by the Political Agent, for this purpose placing under his orders a certain proportion of his own establishment, and making over to him a seal similar to that used by the Darb\u00e1r. Early in 1869, by the votes of the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d, the council was chosen, and the general direction of affairs was assumed by the Political Agent. The R\u00e1o agreed as heretofore, to pay the expenses of the council, and the executive work of the court was conducted by his officials.\n\nThe R\u00e1o soon after prepared a lengthy printed memorial, giving his view of the case. This, after being fully considered by Government, was disposed of on the 3rd November 1870. Government from an anxious desire to end the dispute, and to maintain the dignity and position of the R\u00e1o, determined to make several changes in the draft agreement. The most important were, that the R\u00e1o was to appoint the members of the council on his own responsibility; that the permission granted to several holders of lower jurisdiction to combine to form a higher jurisdiction would not be pressed; that when the R\u00e1o bought a whole village, the jurisdiction might go with it, but not with portions of land less than an entire village; and that as regards the advice given to the R\u00e1o by the council, Government would allow the matter to continue on the terms provided in the treaty. The R\u00e1o was invited to agree to the amended draft, and to frame a set of rules for the conduct of business.\n\nFor some months the R\u00e1o gave no answer. Meanwhile (28th February 1871) the Political Agent submitted a report to Government on the working of the court during the past two years. He considered that the members of the council were more or less under\nthe R\u00e1o's influence; that the working of the court was thereby obstructed; that, as a rule, the proprietors ministered justice fairly on their own estates, and that their sub-vassals were incited against them by those about the R\u00e1o's person.\n\nOn the 6th May 1871, Col. Law, the acting Political Agent, reported to Government that the R\u00e1o seemed more inclined to come to a compromise. His chief objection to the amended draft agreement was the principle on which the list of guarantee holders had been made out. He wished to restrict the holders to the terms of the treaty, under which the guarantee was given. With regard to this, Col. Law proposed that the guarantee holders to be specified in the first instance should be the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d of 1819, and their descendants, leaving all others to prove their title subject to the sanction of Government. The R\u00e1o next objected that the powers proposed for the several classes of guarantee holders were excessive; that the provision for appeal was insufficient; that no care had been shown for the rights of original holders, *mul gir\u00e1s\u00edas*, in Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d estates; and that the clause which excluded the court's cognizance except on the complaint of one of the parties, gave a freedom from inquiry even in the case of heinous offences. He also protested against the rule that jurisdiction went only with purchases of whole villages.\n\nIn their letter 2261 of the 2nd June 1871, Government declined to accept any modification of their former draft agreement, the terms of which were more liberal than those ordered by the Secretary of State; these terms, they said, were only offered conditionally, and must fall to the ground unless the R\u00e1o accepted them in their entirety. In reply the R\u00e1o suggested that the Political Agent should proceed to the seat of Government to explain personally the R\u00e1o's views and come to some final settlement. To this course Government agreed, and on the 7th October 1871, Col. Law submitted the R\u00e1o's emendations to the amended draft agreement. He pointed out that the R\u00e1o had changed the ancient council of his realm whose advice he might neglect, for a constitutional court whose decisions were legally binding, and that he acknowledged the appellate jurisdiction of the British Government as Lord Paramount in all matters connected with the new court. These were the vital points; others such as whom the guarantee was to be comprehended, what classification was to be adopted, what powers assigned, and how appeals were to be regulated, were matters of detail fairly open to the fullest debate.\n\nOn the 18th July 1872, Col. Law submitted an amended draft as agreed to by the R\u00e1o, and this draft was submitted to the Government of India by the Government of Bombay on the 23rd March 1872, with a strong recommendation that it should be agreed to, in order that this long discussion might be closed. In their letter of 15th July 1872 to the Secretary of State, the Government of India recommended the adoption of the rules suggested by the Government of Bombay, and the Secretary of State, in his despatch of the 27th July 1873, sanctioned the settlement, with the proviso, that, in cases of proved injustice, it should be within\nthe discretion of the R\u00e1o, on the advice of the Political Agent, to call for and if necessary quash the proceedings of any of the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d chiefs. In forwarding these despatches the Government of Bombay, on the 28th February 1873, directed the Political Agent to lay before the R\u00e1o and the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d the settlement that had been sanctioned by the highest authority, and to inform the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d that the continuance of the guarantee in each individual case would depend on their faithful allegiance to the R\u00e1o, the performance of such duties as might in the opinion of Government be attached to their tenures, and the general good management of their estates. At the same time the Political Agent was called on to urge the R\u00e1o to frame and submit rules of procedure for the confirmation of Government.\n\nOn the 7th November 1873, the Political Agent reported to Government that the R\u00e1o had assented to occupy his legitimate position as appellate judge of the J\u00e1deja court, and on the 25th April 1874, submitted for approval draft rules, under Article 4 of the new settlement, for the procedure of the court. In reviewing these rules Government (4543 of the 10th August 1874) suggested various changes, stating that if they were adopted by the R\u00e1o, Government were prepared to accord their approval of the rules. The R\u00e1o was requested to revise the draft and to satisfy Government as to his intention to appoint a properly qualified officer as President of the Court. On the 6th October 1874, the acting Political Agent reported on the amendments which the R\u00e1o proposed should be made in the settlement. On the 16th April 1875, the Political Agent reported that Mr. Vin\u00e2yak N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Bh\u00e1gvat had been appointed Naib Diw\u00e1n and President of the J\u00e1deja Court, but that the R\u00e1o objected to his entering on his duties until the court had been formally made over to the R\u00e1o\u2019s charge.\n\nIn their Resolution 3661 of 26th May 1875, Government agreed to exclude from the settlement Rule VII., regarding the sale by a guarantee holder of land with jurisdiction, and to reserve the question at issue for future settlement. They would not agree to the changes proposed by the R\u00e1o in Rules III. and IV., but subject to the approval of the Government of India and the Secretary of State, accepted all other amendments and additions. They also agreed to the alterations in the draft rules of procedure suggested by the R\u00e1o, and hoped that no further delay might take place in the introduction of the settlement. On the 8th October 1875, Government sanctioned the procedure submitted with the Political Agent\u2019s letter of the 23rd September, and requested that the R\u00e1o\u2019s signature might be obtained. Shortly after this (January 1st, 1876) the R\u00e1o died without having signed the papers. But as it was shown that he had fully accepted the settlement and procedure, Government, in their letter of 7th July 1876, intimated that the signature was not considered necessary. They directed the Political Agent to inform the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d who had presented petitions to the Government in 1870, and had repeated their requests to Major Goodfellow in 1872, that, in consultation with the R\u00e1o, it had been found necessary to revise the original settlement of 1868; that the R\u00e1o had lately consented\nto take over the court and work it under revised rules, and had chosen an experienced officer as President; that all of the Bhayad's guaranteed rights had been preserved by the new rules; and that Government had every confidence that the court would be worked to the satisfaction of the Bhayad, and advised them to give it a fair trial for at least a year. Any representation they might wish to make would then be heard. The court was re-organized, and the new rules of settlement and procedure were brought into operation on the 1st November 1876, when the Political Agent formally transferred its control to the Council of Regency.\n\nSpecial measures were adopted by the Council of Regency to clear off the heavy arrears of the Jadeja court. On the date the Council of Regency received charge, the balance stood at 1223 civil and 154 criminal cases. On 1st April 1879, it was reduced to 112 civil and 11 criminal cases. In February 1878, Government decided that the British guarantee enjoyed by the Jadeja chiefs applied only to the ancestral land held at the date of the treaty of 1819 and not to any lands since acquired. Government have also approved of the Rao levying from the Bhayad a moderate succession fee as a form of recognition rather than a fiscal levy.\n\nDuring his visit to Cutch in November 1877, His Excellency Sir Richard Temple, Governor of Bombay, thus explained to the Bhayad the duties and responsibilities attaching to their tenures. 'I observe one peculiarity here which is this, that while His Highness the Rao is the master of the province of Cutch, and has to defend the whole country, to carry on its entire administration, and to be responsible for its moral and material prosperity, he enjoys only half its revenues, the other half going to his numerous relations called collectively the Bhayad. It is therefore fair that the Bhayad should bear their share in the general expenses of the country and co-operate with His Highness the Rao in effecting improvements; they should educate their peasantry and retainers; they must establish schools not only in their own places of residence and principal towns, but also in their villages; they should also try to improve the health of their people by opening dispensaries and adopting preventive measures such as vaccination; they should also contribute their fair share towards the construction of roads in order to carry agricultural produce to the sea-ports, and facilitate trade. The British Government have guaranteed the chiefs of the Bhayad in the enjoyment of their ancestral lands, but they expect them to do their duty both towards the Rao and towards their cultivators, and thus fulfil the obligations attached to their tenures. The Bhayad should remember that it is not enough that they should collect their revenues, and preserve the peace. They must also co-operate with the administration of the Rao in all measures calculated to promote the moral and material prosperity of the country. Some of the Bhayad hold certain civil and criminal jurisdiction. This is and will be based on their intelligence, education, and industry, and also on the extent of their holdings, but I cannot\n\n---\n\n1 Gov. Res. 818, 18th February 1878.\npromise that jurisdiction will be confirmed to those who are not qualified by their education and ability to personally exercise it, or whose holdings are petty and insignificant. If the Bhayad duly fulfil the duties and responsibilities which I have just enumerated, the British Government will be always glad to see His Highness the Rao surrounded by a body of his own kinsmen, who by their position, intelligence, and experience, will, from generation to generation, support the administration of the country.' In December 1873, Government remarked that it was most gratifying to learn that the settlement lately effected between the Rao and his Bhayad was producing happy results, and that a foundation had been laid for a future good understanding between the Rao and his leading subjects. It should, Government added, be the object of the Political Agent to make the Bhayad feel a pride and an interest in the state of which their lands are component parts, but they must be prepared to contribute towards the expense of measures designed for the good of the whole province.\n\nChapter IX.\nJustice.\nJadeja Court.\n\n1 Gov. Res. 5420, 22nd December 1873.\nCHAPTER X.\n\nREVENUE AND FINANCE.\n\nThe total yearly revenue of the province, including that of the Bhayad and other petty chiefs, is estimated at about \u00a3240,000 (Rs. 24,00,000). Of this about \u00a3130,000 (Rs. 13,00,000) belong to His Highness the Rao. In 1852-53 the state revenue was \u00a371,540 (Rs. 7,15,400), and in 1876-77, \u00a3147,968 (Rs. 14,79,680), or an increase of 106\u00b788 per cent. During twenty-five years (1858-1877) customs receipts have risen from \u00a317,466 to \u00a380,149 (Rs. 1,74,660 - 8,01,490) or 358\u00b788 per cent; and land revenue receipts from \u00a320,719 to \u00a341,262 (Rs. 2,07,190 - 4,12,620) or 99\u00b715 per cent. Under the terms of the treaty of 1832 the yearly sum due by the Rao in return for military aid was fixed at \u00a318,695 (Rs. 1,86,950). Surplus revenue is invested in Government paper and the purchase of giras land in the province. The state has no dealings with any banker.\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nINSTRUCTION.\n\nDuring the last twenty-five years education has made very rapid progress in Cutch. In 1854 there was only one vernacular school at Bhuj, its cost, when more was spent than the amount received in school fees, being borne by the R\u00e1o. Neither the R\u00e1o nor his people took any interest in education. In 1860 there were three schools, one Anglo-vernacular and two vernacular, with 450 boys on the rolls and an average daily attendance of 328 pupils. In 1870-71 there were fourteen schools, nine in the R\u00e1o\u2019s territory and five in the villages of the smaller chiefs. Of these two were for girls. In 1875-76 there were 43 schools and 2944 students. In 1878-79 there were, under an educational inspector, seventy-one schools with, on the rolls, 3969 pupils, and an average attendance of 3251. The total expenditure on these schools amounted to \u00a33169 10s. (Rs. 31,695), and the receipts from fees to \u00a3242 12s. (Rs. 2426). Of the seventy-one schools, one was a high school with forty-one pupils teaching up to the Bombay University entrance test standard; two were Anglo-vernacular schools with 99 pupils; fifty-eight were primary schools with 3427 pupils; six were girls\u2019 schools with 300 pupils, and four, with 102 pupils, were working-men\u2019s night schools. Besides these, there is at Bhuj a posh\u00e1l or school for teaching Hindu poetry, the students being maintained by the Darb\u00e1r; and at M\u00e1ndvi, under a well trained teacher and in a fair condition, a Sanskrit college established and fairly well endowed by Gos\u00e1i Sukl\u00e1\u00ed Gir, a Cutch banker. In July 1877 an art school was opened and supplied with a competent teacher from the Bombay Sir Jamsetji Jijibh\u00e1i School of Art. At the end of March 1878 it had on its rolls fifty-five pupils. The late R\u00e1o Pr\u00e1gmalji was a warm friend to education. In 1870 at a cost of \u00a315,000 (Rs. 1,50,000) he founded a high school and named it the Alfred High School in honour of His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh. In 1872 a sum of \u00a32000 (Rs. 20,000) being raised to commemorate His Highness\u2019 visit to Bombay, he added \u00a32500 (Rs. 25,000) to it, out of which \u00a33000 (Rs. 30,000) were offered to the Bombay University, and two scholarships, tenable for three years at any of the recognized colleges, were established, to be awarded every year to the two Cutchi students who passed the Matriculation Examination with the highest number of marks. Scholarships are also held out by the Darb\u00e1r as an encouragement to students to leave Cutch and study in distant schools and colleges.\nThe 1872 census returns give, for the two chief races of the district, the following proportion of persons able to read and write.

The Bhuj Library was established in 1868 and in 1874 was, at a cost of \u00a3264 (Rs. 2640), provided with a building by Mr. Keshavji N\u00e1ik, a Cutchi merchant and trader in Bombay. The number of subscribers is (1878-79) returned at twenty-six, the collections during the year at \u00a316 (Rs. 160), and the expenses at \u00a312 (Rs. 120). The library catalogue shows a total of 747 volumes. The M\u00e1ndvi Library was established in 1864 and has a good building of its own, built in 1870 at a cost of \u00a3413 (Rs. 4130). The number of subscribers is returned at thirty-four, the collections during the year at \u00a329 (Rs. 290) and the expenses at \u00a311 (Rs. 110). It has a total of 739 volumes. The Mundra Library, established in 1874, has no building of its own. The number of subscribers is returned at thirty, the collections during the year at \u00a35 (Rs. 50), and the expenses at \u00a33 (Rs. 30). It has a total of 314 volumes. Two reading rooms have recently been opened at Jakh\u00e1n and Nahia respectively. From a state printing press attached to the public offices a fortnightly gazette the Cutch R\u00e1j Patra is issued.\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nHEALTH.\n\nThe famine of 1811 and 1812 was, at the close of the latter year, followed in Cutch by an outbreak of pestilence so deadly, that it is said to have destroyed half the people of the country. What, along with the weakened state of the people, must have strengthened, if it did not give rise to, this plague, was overcrowding in the towns, where on account of the disorders of the four preceding years, people from the villages had sought shelter. For two years the disease abated. Then in May 1815, the year of the heaviest known rainfall, it broke out with deadly force at Kanthkot in east Cutch. As in Ahmedabad, its symptoms were slight fever followed by great weakness and weariness, and then swellings in the groin and arm-pits suppurating in some cases and in others remaining hard lumps. Few stricken with the disease recovered. Most died between the third and the ninth day. The plague seemed in the air; there was nothing to show that it had been brought from outside, or was spread by the touch. It seemed to attack most fiercely the sluggish and vegetable eaters; Rajputs escaped where Brahmins and V\u0101niyas died in numbers. Oil-makers were believed to be safe. In Bhuj, care was taken that no one should come from the affected districts. One man died, those with him were turned out, and the house was smoked with brimstone and unroofed. From Kanthkot the disease spread to other parts of V\u0101gad, causing much loss of life in the early months of 1816. In May it crossed to Morvi in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, and came back in August within ten miles of Bhuj, and at the same time raged in R\u0101dhanpur and Sind. In 1817 from Morvi it travelled to Dholera. Since 1817 there has been no return of this pestilence.\n\nThe prevailing diseases are malarious fevers, rheumatism, smallpox, measles, stone, and skin diseases. Fever is most widespread about the close of the rainy season (October), and in some years rages with great violence; rheumatism is more complained of in the cold weather. In 1826 Dr. Burnes noted that cholera, though very fatal in the neighbouring countries, had never made much progress in Cutch. But in 1876 there was a rather serious outbreak in eight months (March - October) causing 954 deaths. This was followed by a still severer attack in 1878. Coming from K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r cholera made its first appearance in V\u0101gad in April 1878, and continued in\n\n---\n\n1 Dr. McAdam, Anj\u00e1r and Cutch, 6th November 1816. Trans. Bom. Med. and Phy. Soc. I. 183-189.\n2 Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 230.\ndifferent parts of Cutch till August. It came last to Bhuj and was there very fatal. No endeavours were spared to suppress the epidemic, and arrangements were made to distribute medicine. Abating in August, perhaps by the help of the very heavy rainfall said to be the heaviest since 1815, the cholera was in September followed by an epidemic of malarious fever that attacked every village and hamlet in the province, and was so severe that in Bhuj alone, of a population of 23,000 souls, for two months about forty died a day. Efforts were made to check the disease and lessen the suffering. Extra dispensaries were opened, and medicines distributed by special agents. A body of men was employed to visit the houses of the destitute and supply them with cots, beds, and medicine. The effects of the fever were disastrous. Landholders could not work in their fields, the supply of labourers ceased, and state offices, schools, and workshops had to be closed. The number of ascertained deaths from cholera and fever amounted to 15,716, or taking the population of Cutch at 487,345, a percentage of 3\u00b72.\n\nIn 1878-79 besides the Bhuj civil hospital and lunatic asylum, there were three dispensaries, at M\u00e1ndvi, Anj\u00e1r, and Nalia, the last opened in March 1879. During the year at the Bhuj hospital and at M\u00e1ndvi and Anj\u00e1r dispensaries 53,123 persons were treated, 552 of them in-door and 52,571 out-door patients. The total amount spent in checking disease in 1878-79 was \u00a32332 (Rs. 23,320). The chief forms of sickness were ague, cholera, malarious fever, leprosy, bronchitis, dysentery, mycetoma, and diarrhoea.\n\nThe civil hospital at Bhuj was built in 1851 at a cost of \u00a3732 (Rs. 7320) and has room for thirty-five patients. Including 389 in-patients, the total number treated was 23,839. Of these 19,446 were cured, 3895 left, 106 died, and 392 remained under treatment. The average daily sick was 365\u00b792. The total cost during the year was \u00a31334 (Rs. 13,340). The Bhuj lunatic asylum, or rather lock-up for lunatics, established in 1876, but as yet with no building of its own, contained in 1878-79 twenty-one inmates, of whom two were cured and fifteen died, leaving a balance of four. The total cost during the year amounted to \u00a394 18s. (Rs. 949). The M\u00e1ndvi dispensary, opened in 1866, has a building of its own constructed at a cost of \u00a3773 (Rs. 7730). Including 163 in-patients, the total number treated was 19,489. Of these 17,497 were cured, 1629 left, eighty died, and 283 remained under treatment. The average daily sick was 318\u00b76, and the total cost during the year \u00a3608 (Rs. 6080). The Anj\u00e1r dispensary was opened in 1877-78. Of 9795, the total number of patients, all out-door, 8119 were cured, 1420 left, thirty-three died, and 223 remained under treatment. The average daily sick was 233\u00b786 and the total cost during the year \u00a3389 (Rs. 3890). Of the new dispensary at Nalia, opened at the end of the last official year (1878-79) no details are available.\n\nIn 1878-79 the work of vaccination was, under a superintendent of vaccination, carried on by fifteen vaccinators. The total number of operations, including 451 re-vaccinations, was 11,763 against 13,747 in the previous year.\nThe following abstract shows the sex, religion, and age of the persons vaccinated:\n\n**Cutch Vaccination Details, 1872-73 and 1878-79.**\n\n| Year | Sex | Religion | Age | Total |\n|------|-----|----------|-----|-------|\n|      | Males | Females | Hindus | Musalmans | Parsis | Under one year | Above one year |\n| 1872-73 | 1036 | 896 | 1327 | 599 | 6 | 387 | 1545 | 1932 |\n| 1878-79 | 6048 | 5715 | 8621 | 3142 | ... | 5067 | 6698 | 11,763 |\n\nThe total cost of these operations was in 1878-79, \u00a3654 (Rs. 6540) or about 1s. 2d. (9\u00bd annas) for each successful case.\n\nA severe form of horse disease called *jerbay* broke out in 1878-79 and carried off sixty-four state horses. It is described as a poisoning of the blood, brought on by the irritating and inflammatory action of numerous and incessant bites of mosquitos and other insects. The horse's whole system becomes inflamed, the belly and feet swell, the skin becomes tight and shiny; the digestion is impaired, and general debility follows, ending in death. In 1878 camels also suffered severely. A disease called locally *phitoda*, and said to be contagious, carried off fifteen out of twenty state riding camels. The nature of the disease, fatal alike to milch and baggage camels, has not been ascertained. Some say it is the effect of innumerable fly and mosquito bites, and others ascribe it to some poisonous substance swallowed while grazing. The symptoms of the camel disease were, poverty of blood, swelling of the body beginning with the feet, impatience of heat, inflammation of the lungs, nausea, aversion from food, and gradual wasting. It seems probable that this as well as the horse disease and the very fatal form of fever were due to the unwholesome state of the air, the result of the excessive and unusual rainfall.\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nPLACES OF INTEREST.\n\nChapter XIII. A'desar, in V\u00e1gad, on the Ran, has a population of 3028 souls, Places of Interest. and some trade in grain and molasses. The ruined walls show traces of its bombardment by R\u00e1o Bh\u00e1rmalji in 1816.\n\nAdhoi, a walled town, belonging to Morvi, on a hill, has 4336 inhabitants, and a considerable cotton trade. About two miles to the north are small hewn caves, said to have once been used as hiding places by the K\u00e1th\u00eds.\u00b9\n\n\u00c1ma'ra, about forty-eight miles west of Bhuj, has a yearly fair in honour of Kara K\u00e1sim, an Amir of Ghazni, who, travelling in western India, early in the fourteenth century, was killed by the Samma Rajputs then reigning in Cutch.\u00b2 The fair, beginning on the first Monday of Cha\u00edtra vad (April-May) and lasting five days, is under the supervision of Pir Sh\u00e1h Mur\u00e1d of Mundra. At first conducted on a very humble scale, it has during the last twenty-five years risen into importance. The number of pilgrims, most of them Musalm\u00e1ns and low class Hindus from Cutch, H\u00e1l\u00e1r, and Sind, averages from 4000 to 10,000. The value of the offerings paid to the tomb in cash, cocoanuts, cloth, goats, sheep, sweetmeats, and dates, is, in a prosperous season, about \u00a3100 (4000 koris). The trade in rice, dates, coloured cloth, bullocks, camels, and sweetmeats, is valued at about \u00a32000 (75,000 koris). Payment is generally made in cash, but copper pots, bullocks, and camels, are sometimes bartered. There is no crowding and there have been no outbreaks of disease.\n\nAnja'r, in north latitude 23\u00b012' and east longitude 70\u00b010', about twenty-five miles south-east of Bhuj and six from the north-east shore of the gulf of Cutch, with about 13,000 inhabitants, is, for size, population, and trade, the third in the province. Standing near a large lake in a plain bare on all sides except to the west where it is well wooded and highly tilled, the town is surrounded by a wall about sixteen feet high and six thick.\u00b3 Though about ten miles\n\n\u00b9 Mr. Dalpatr\u00e1m P.

The walls, much ruined by the 1819 earthquake, were repaired in 1826. At each of the five gates a stone slab let into the walls has the inscription: 'Shri, after worship to Ganes\u00e1, to Ash\u00e1pura, Hirjip\u00e1l, Mah\u00e1devr\u00e1v, in the year of Vikram 1875 (1819 A.D.) in the month of Jeth on the ninth of the dark half of the moon on Wednesday an earthquake destroyed the fort of Anj\u00e1r. During the minority of the illustrious R\u00e1o Des\u00e1lji the regency ordered the walls to be rebuilt and in the month of Ash\u00e1d in the year of Vikram 1882 (1826 A.D.) on the ninth of the month being Thursday the work was begun, the people made happy, and the city flourishing.

I. 298.\nfrom the coast, Anj\u00e1r is considered a port, and Tuna, Rohar, Vav\u00e1nya, and Janghi, its landing places. Of these the chief are, Tuna near the mouth of the Nakti creek, and Rohar on the same creek a few miles further up. From Tuna vessels of 17 to 34 tons (50-100 kh\u00e1nidis) trade not only in the gulf, but with Bombay and other western India ports. The mouth of the creek is sheltered by the Takro island, but vessels wishing to discharge have, before reaching the pier, to work their way about half a mile up a winding tidal creek. This creek formerly much choked is being cleared. A tidal basin now under construction at the meeting of the two creeks will remove many of the difficulties of the port. The traffic of Rohar is chiefly with Vav\u00e1nya on the other side of the inner gulf of Cutch, dependent on Anj\u00e1r, where the state has a customs establishment.\n\nAccording to local accounts Anj\u00e1r was in 805 (S. 862) founded by Ajep\u00e1l, brother of the king of Ajmir, who, defeated by some Musalm\u00e1n invaders, became an ascetic. By the middle of the twelfth century it was the centre of a group of twelve villages. It rose to greater importance under Kheng\u00e1rji (1548-1585), and was fortified by Desalji (1718-1741) early in the eighteenth century. In 1800 the town, port, and dependencies of Anj\u00e1r were granted to Fateh Muhammad, who busied himself in extending its trade and establishing the harbour of Tuna. On the 25th December 1815, Anj\u00e1r was invested by a force under Colonel East, and Tuna was occupied on the next day. In the following year the fort and dependent villages were made over to the British and held by them till 1822. In 1819 the towers and curtains of the fort wall were destroyed by the earthquake; upwards of 1500 houses were thrown down and as many more made unsafe. About 165 people were killed and many fatally bruised. In 1837 Anj\u00e1r had 2434 houses and a population of about 10,260 souls. The trade to Malab\u00e1r, Bombay, and Maskat supported about 200 boats. In 1855 Anj\u00e1r had 2400 houses, and in 1861 an estimated population of about 15,000 souls. Cotton, oil, grain, and a common kind of local cloth were the chief articles of trade. Anj\u00e1r has a seldom used, mean and ugly palace of the R\u00e1os and a very comfortable two-storied residence for Europeans built by Captain MacMurdo in 1818.\n\n---\n\n1 This inner gulf is a shallow lagoon about ten miles from north to south and eight from east to west, surrounded, on the west and south, with huge swamps under water at spring tides, and at other times low mangrove-covered islands separated by a network of tidal creeks.

The image of black marble is placed on a table overlaid with silver. The shrine doors, also plated with silver, bear an inscription dated Samvat 1869 (1812 A.D.). On some of the eight pilasters that support the dome are carved mermaids and N\u00e1ga figures. Mohanr\u00e1i\u2019s temple, smaller and plainer, with a neatly carved wooden door, is also a Vaishnav shrine, the idols being Krishna with R\u00e1dha on his left, and Chaturbhuj, the four-armed Vishnu, on his right. This temple was rebuilt between 1814 and 1824. Amba M\u00e1ta\u2019s shrine and the monastery close by are built of fragments of older temples. Over the enclosure gateway is a door of hard reddish stone, carved all round, which from the repetition of Devi on the jambs and lintels may have belonged to a Vaishnav Sh\u00e1kta temple; sculptured slabs also lie about, and are built into the walls. The adjoining monastery belongs to the Atits of Ajep\u00e1l. Ajep\u00e1l\u2019s shrine, outside the town walls, is a small modern domed room, with images of Ajep\u00e1l on horseback and of Ganpati. At the door is an inscription dated 1842. The shrine enjoys the revenues of some villages and certain privileges granted by different rulers. The Atits are Shai, the sacred bull with brass horns holding a prominent place on the platform at the entrance to the shrine. Their headmen, g\u00edrs or gurus, are buried around, and the small cells over their remains are marked by the ling. Their patron saint is a Choh\u00e1n king of Ajmir, who gave up his throne, became an ascetic, and ended his days by a voluntary death. Kalya Mah\u00e1dev\u2019s temple, outside the walls, is comparatively modern, with a dancing yogini as its goddess. V\u00e1nk\u00e1l M\u00e1ta\u2019s temple, to the north-west of the town, is dedicated to a form of Bhav\u00e1n\u00ed. Bharesvar at some distance to the south-east has an old shrine and spire and a modern hall. To the west of the town is a new temple of Dv\u00e1rkan\u00e1th, and close to it an unfinished one to Bahuchar\u00e1ji, with three shrines on as many sides of the intended entrance hall. Bahuchara is the \u201clooking glass\u201d goddess, before whom the votary worships his own image in a piece of silvered glass. The other two shrines are dedicated to Bhav\u00e1n\u00ed and the ling.\n\nTo the east of Ajep\u00e1l\u2019s monastery is a small tiled shed with tombs of Muhammadan pattern sacred to Jesar, a J\u00e1deja, and his wife Turi, a K\u00e1thi. The story of this shrine is that about the middle of the fourteenth century Jesar, grandson of J\u00e1m L\u00e1kh\u00e1 J\u00e1deja, becoming an outlaw laid waste fields and villages, killed the people,\n\n---\n\n1 Bom.

Details of these ascetics are given in the \u201cPopulation\u201d chapter, p. 83.\n3 The story of this ascetic king is that he was a brother of a certain Prithvir\u00e1j of Ajmir. A Muhammadan beggar, who, for thrusting his hands into a bowl of the king\u2019s milk had two fingers cut off, went to Ber Arab and called on Mir\u00e1n to avenge his loss, Mir\u00e1n came but was killed by Prithvir\u00e1j. To avenge his death, Mir\u00e1n\u2019s maternal uncle, the Khw\u00e1ja Pir, attacked and defeated the Ajmir brother, Ajep\u00e1l retiring to Anj\u00e1r as an anchorite. The tale is probably a relic of one of the early Arab invasions (685). Bom. Gov. Sel. CLI, (New Series), 56.\n4 Burgess\u2019 Arch, Sur. Rep. 1874-75, 211.\nand carried off the cattle. At that time a K\u00e1thi woman, Turi by name, was famous for her devotion and her skill in making hymns, and still more famous for her beauty. She lived with an ascetic called S\u00e1vasdhir, who did not regard her as his wife but as one who would bring him salvation. The fame of her beauty reached Jesar, who tried to carry her off by force but failed. Going back in the guise of an ascetic he was well received, and arranged to seize her at some midnight worship. His plans were found out, and, on his confessing, the sect whose rule was to grant the wish of every asker gave him Turi on condition that he became an ascetic. Jesar agreed, but, soon tiring of the restraint, again tried to carry off Turi by force. She by arts, good deeds, and other wonders, foiled him and in time changed him into a model ascetic. Settling at Anj\u00e1r, Jesar died and Turi was buried alive close by his tomb. His descendants the Jesar Rajputs have, in each of the twelve villages, a shrine of Jesar and Turi. The shrine at Anj\u00e1r is under the charge of the Ajep\u00e1l monastery.\n\nBagda, about seven miles from Bhadresar, with 322 inhabitants, has in its suburbs some memorial stones, p\u00e1l\u00edas, the earliest dated 1648 (S. 1705) dedicated to one Khatri Parm\u00e1nand. Halfway between Bagda and V\u00e1ghora is a small temple of Mah\u00e1dev Phuleshvar, eleven feet by twelve, with writing which seems to show that it was rebuilt in 1837 (S. 1894) by one Sv\u00e1mi Sura\u00edgar. Weather-worn images of P\u00e1rvati, Hanum\u00e1n, and the Sacred Bull lie about, and there is a ruined sati memorial stone dated 1630 (S. 1687). The step-well between Bagda and V\u00e1ghora was, in 1853 (S. 1910), rebuilt by Gos\u00e1i Hir\u00e1g\u00e1r Jivangar.\n\nBela, in V\u00e1gad, with 3644 inhabitants, is the chief mart of the Cutch and Thar and Parkar trade in cotton and clarified butter, ghi.

It stands in a court about 48 feet wide by 85 long, surrounded by a row of forty-four shrines with a corridor in front. The temple stands rather far back in a courtyard, which, from the line of the temple front, is covered by three pillared domes. The temple, facing the east, is entered by a flight of steps that rise from the outer door to the covered area in front of the sanctuary. Over the porch is another large dome covering an area separated by a low screen wall from the area of the entrance hall, mandap, between it and the front of the temple itself. At the south-west corner and behind the cells on the left side is a row of chambers with cellars entered by lifting up flagstones in the floor. In the shrine are three white marble images. The central image is Ajitn\u00e1th, the second of the Tirthankars, with the date 622 probably for S. 1622 or A.D. 1565. On his right is P\u00e1rasvan\u00e1th with the snake hood marked 1175 (S. 1232), and on his left S\u00e1ntin\u00e1th, the 16th Tirthankar, also marked 1175 (S. 1232). On the extreme right is the image of the black or s\u00e1mla P\u00e1rasvan\u00e1th. On the left of the sculpture immediately above the base are the Devis, and on each side of the Devis small obscene figures rare in a Jain temple.\u00b9 The different temple traditions were, about the beginning of the present century, compiled by a Jain monk. The earlier parts, altered apparently to fit with 622 the date on Ajitn\u00e1th's statue, contain few trustworthy details.\u00b2 Perhaps the earliest historical fact is that in the twelfth century (1125), Jagdusha, a merchant who had made a fortune as a grain dealer in a time of famine, received a grant of Bhadresar and had the temple so thoroughly repaired that all traces of antiquity were removed. To this man is probably due the present plan of the temple and most of the building as it now stands. Dying childless in 1181 (S. 1238) it fell to Naughan V\u00e1ghela, and in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries was a most popular place of pilgrimage. Under the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s it was seized by J\u00e1m H\u00e1la and afterwards by J\u00e1m R\u00e1val in 1535 (S. 1592). At the close of the seventeenth century (1698) it was plundered by a Muhammadan force and many of the images were broken. Since then it has been neglected. In 1763 the walls of the old fort began to be pulled down and the stones used for building, and about 1810 even the old temples were\n\n\u00b9 Burgess' Arch. Sur.

His successors were Mah\u00e1sen, N\u00e1rsen, Bhojr\u00e1j, Vann\u00e1j, S\u00e1rangdev, Virasen, Harisen, who lived in the time of Vikram (67 B.C.). Then came Kirtidhara, Dharnip\u00e1l, Devdatt, and Danjir\u00e1j. Then, after a time of confusion came 156 (S. 213), Vann\u00e1j V\u00e1ghela of Munipar, and after him Yogr\u00e1j, Ratn\u00e1datt, and Vijayar\u00e1v. Next, after a time of misrule, the K\u00e1this of P\u00e1v\u00e1rdav\u00e1 seized Bhadravat\u00ed and kept it for 147 years. After them, 551 (S. 618), Kanak Ch\u00e1vda of P\u00e1tan took the country, built the temple, and in 555 (S. 622) set up the image of Ajitn\u00e1th. (This is apparently brought in to fit the date on the statue). Kanak's successor, though invaded by the Musalm\u00e1ns, was followed by his son Bhuv\u00e1d who lost his kingdom to the Solankis of Bh\u00e1ngad. The new rulers changed the name of the place to Bhadresar, 741 (S. 798), and continued to hold it till 1132 (S. 1189). Burgess' Arch. Surv.

South-west is another mosque, once entered from the east but now from the north. In it is a small apparently unfinished chamber. The walls are of large most accurately jointed stones, and the roofs of flat slabs. The doors have drips over them, two with semi-circular arches and the others with lintels. The architraves are carved with neat creeper patterns and with large flowers below. Pir L\u00e1l Shob\u00e1h's tomb, in a small walled enclosure, has a square pyramid shaped dome, round in the inside and supported on eight pillars set against the wall.

The town, with in 1872 a population of about 24,000 souls, is pleasantly situated in a plain between two streams, each about two miles distant from the city wall. In shape an irregular polygon, it is surrounded by a well kept solid stone wall, thirty-five feet high and four thick, with towers at irregular intervals armed with fifty-one guns. In the walls are five gates, the Mah\u00e1dev, P\u00e1tvadi, Sirpat, Bh\u00edd\u00e1val, and V\u00e1n\u00edv\u00e1d. Inside the walls, the streets, narrow and crooked, hardly passable by a horse carriage, are lined by high stone walls, the enclosures of dwellings that often open either from a corner or from a side lane. The houses, each in the centre of an enclosing wall, though low, are generally strongly built of stone with small loophole-like windows. On the west close to the town walls are two pleasantly laid out gardens, the Sarad and Kh\u00e1s B\u00e1g, belonging to His Highness the R\u00e1o. Each has its garden house and both are well shaded and watered and gay with flowers. To the north is the race course.\\footnote{Col. Barton; Trans. Bom. Geog. Soc. I. 310; and Hamilton's Description of Hindust\u00e1n, I. 596.}\n\nThe climate of Bhuj, though hot and at times oppressive, is generally healthy. The well water is hard and brackish, and the chief sources of supply are two ponds outside of the town, the Desalsar to the north-east soon dry, and the Hamirsar to the southwest in good seasons holding water all the year round. Of late years the Hamirsar lake has been much improved by turning into it water-courses from the hill range to the south, and by reducing its area by building a causeway across it. In other respects little has been done to improve the town. The streets though unlighted are kept clean by the city municipality.\\footnote{Col. Barton.}\nBhuj, formerly sacred to the snake Bhujang,\\(^1\\) was in 1548 chosen as his capital by R\u00e1o Khengr\u00e1ji (1548-1585). After (1590) the R\u00e1o was forced to acknowledge Moghal supremacy, Bhuj would seem to have been known among the Musalm\u00e1ns as Suleim\u00e1n Nagar.\\(^2\\) The walls were built by R\u00e1o Godji in 1723, and the fort of Bhujia by Devkarn Seth in R\u00e1o Desal's time (1718-1741). Bhuj has been six times attacked. In two cases the defence was successful and in four it failed. In 1728 an attack by Sarbuland Kh\u00e1n, Viceroy of Gujar\u00e1t, was repulsed by R\u00e1o Desalji (1718-1741), and, in 1765 Ghul\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h of Sind was, by a timely display of the strength of the fortifications, induced to withdraw. During the civil troubles of the reign of the mad R\u00e1o R\u00e1ydh\u00e1n (1778-1813) Bhuj was thrice taken, by Meghji Seth in 1786, by Hansr\u00e9j in 1801, and by Fateh Muhamad in 1803. Finally on the 26th March 1819 the hill fort of Bhujia was captured by a British detachment under Sir William Keir. In 1818, Bhuj had 20,000 people and was famous for its clever artists in gold and silver. The great earthquake of the following year (16th June 1819) destroyed nearly 7000 houses with a loss of 1140 human lives. About one-third of the buildings that escaped ruin were much shattered, and the north face of the town wall was levelled with the ground. In 1837 Bhuj is said to have had a population of 30,000 souls, about 6000 of them Musalm\u00e1ns.\\(^3\\)\n\nThe chief objects of interest in the city are the palaces. Of these there are three, R\u00e1o L\u00e1kh\u00e1's, R\u00e1o Pr\u00e1gmalji's, and Fateh Muhamad's. R\u00e1o L\u00e1kh\u00e1's palace, built about 1750, is a large white stone mansion decorated with beautiful carvings and fine fretwork. The chief rooms are an audience hall where darb\u00e1rs are held; the hall of mirrors, \u00e1\u00edna mah\u00e1l; and the state apartment. The hall of audience, then hardly finished, is described by Colonel Tod in 1823 as solid, useful, and comfortable. The chief wonder of the palace, said to have cost over \u00a3200,000 (80,00,000 koris), is, he writes, the hall of mirrors. This, surrounded by a verandah, is about forty-six feet long, forty broad and sixteen high. The floor is inlaid with China tiles, the white marble walls are covered with mirrors separated by gilded ornaments, and adorned with shelves filled with glass figures and vessels. The roof and pillars are decorated with rich gold mouldings and other ornaments, and the small compartments between them are supplied with fittings of triangularly shaped looking-glass. On the floor are a number of Dutch and English chiming clocks all playing at once, a celestial and a terrestrial globe, and some antique pictures all attributed to R\u00e1msing. The walls of the verandah are covered with a strange collection of portraits, R\u00e1na Ranjitsing of Meyw\u00e1r, the Empress Catherine of Russia, R\u00e1ja Bakhtsing of M\u00e1rw\u00e1r, Hogarth's Election, and other English,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Tiefenthaler (1750) describes Bhuj as 'great and strengthened with two forts.'

Close to the hall of mirrors is the state apartment with, in its centre, a small room eight feet square containing R\u00e1o Lakha's bed.\n\nAbout 1865, the late R\u00e1o Pr\u00e1gmalji, from designs prepared by Colonel Wilkins of the Royal Engineers, began a lordly building on a site formerly used for stables and out-houses. The plan provided for a Darb\u00e1r hall eighty feet by forty, and forty feet high to the springing of the roof, with arched verandahs all round and corner towers. Level with the Darb\u00e1r hall runs a suite of seven rooms, five at right angles to the others, forming the ladies' quarters. Staircases lead to an upper floor with a suite of rooms corresponding to those on the first floor. A clock tower, 150 feet high, is connected with the main building by covered galleries. The rooms and verandahs are well proportioned and lofty, the verandahs arched and open to the outside. The capitals and bases are all carved from special designs. The gallery floors are laid with tessellated Carrara marble, and some of the rooms are paved with Minton tiles. The walls and ceilings of both rooms and galleries are painted in oil colours, each tower and gallery with a different design. The balusters of the gallery parapets are of variegated marble, many of them quarried in Cutch. The original design of the interior of the Darb\u00e1r hall was Gothic with an open roof. But the late R\u00e1o was induced to have the hall decorated in the Italian style. A ceiling covered in the open roof, and from huge zinc rosettes chains were hung for chandeliers. The rest of the ceiling is ornamented with cupids and allegoric paintings. Round the hall runs a pure white gallery supported by caryatides. The doors below, and the windows above, are arched, and decorated with figured plate glass. Between each door are marble columns, and the whole is resplendent with gilding and paint. At one end of the hall is a full length portrait of R\u00e1o Pr\u00e1gmalji.\n\nThe other chief buildings in Bhuj are the jail, the hospital, the darb\u00e1r stables, the schools, and Fateh Muhammad's palace. The Jail, a well designed building, stands in a walled enclosure near the Sirpat gate. A round centre tower with radiating ranges of cells, it includes a workshop, kitchens, and women's quarters. It has room for four hundred prisoners. The Hospital, a plain building near the jail, has airy but seldom well filled wards, the people preferring to be treated at their own houses. The Stables, built by the late R\u00e1o in 1865, are roomy and strongly made with places for 400 horses. Not far off, and built at the same time, are the elephant stables, high, airy, and well planned, with separate stalls for ten elephants.

The site is well chosen, and the buildings are airy, roomy, plain, and well planned. Fateh Mahammad\u2019s palace, raised during his term of power early in the present century, is a place of great strength, flat-roofed, with elaborately carved windows.\n\nThe R\u00e1os\u2019 Tombs.\n\nOutside the town walls are some tombs, an old fort, the Residency, the Cantonment, and the Bhuja hill-fort. To the west of the town, on the border of the Hamirsar lake, stand the R\u00e1os\u2019 tombs, built of red sandstone and very richly and curiously decorated, and surrounded by a stone screen or lattice. The tombs suffered from the earthquake of 1819 and are now much ruined. Of these monuments, R\u00e1o L\u00e1kha\u2019s, built about 1770, is the largest and finest. This tomb, polygonal in form, is surrounded by a gallery with two entrances. The roof is curiously and beautifully carved and supported by a pillar at every corner. The south porch has fallen. The central dome covers an apartment surrounded by a wall with a door on the east. In this room, where the ashes of the R\u00e1o were laid, is an image of R\u00e1o L\u00e1kha on horseback, and the tombstones of his fifteen wives, seven on the right and eight on the left. A short way from R\u00e1o L\u00e1kha\u2019s tomb is a smaller one in honour of R\u00e1o R\u00e1yadhan (1778-1813). The tomb of R\u00e1o Desalji, the father of the late R\u00e1o Pr\u00e1gmalji, though small is very beautiful. Quadrangular with a chhatri roof, the side panels are spirited groups of men and animals admirably sculptured. As R\u00e1o Desalji\u2019s wives did not perform sati the building has no dome. R\u00e1o Pr\u00e1gmalji\u2019s tomb, next to his father\u2019s, is a fine specimen of modern carving.\u00b9\n\nThe Cantonment.\n\nTo the south of the tombs on the M\u00e1ndvi road is the Residency, and about a mile east at the foot of Bhuja hill, barren and bare of trees, lies the Cantonment. The camp consists of lines for a Native Infantry Regiment, for a battery of Artillery, Officers\u2019 quarters, a neat little church, barracks, and a market place.\n\nBhuja Hill Fort.\n\nSome 250 feet above the Cantonment rises the hill fort of Bhuja, the top surrounded by a parapet wall of no great strength, entered by one gate, and enclosing an irregular area with a few scattered buildings. At one corner is a small square tower dedicated to the worship of Bhujang, one of the snake family and brother of Seshji, lord of the under-world, p\u00e1t\u00e1l, who came from Th\u00e1n in K\u00e1thi\u00e1war and freed Cutch from the oppression of Daity\u00e1s and R\u00e1kshas\u00e1s. The fort, built about 100 years ago by R\u00e1o Godji, has, since 1819, been held by the British. It was agreed that if certain ground to the north of the town was given as a cantonment, Bhuja would be handed over to the R\u00e1o. But as the land in question has never been offered the British remain in possession of the fort.\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 Postans\u2019 Cutch, 59, 60; Tod\u2019s Western India, 458; Burgess\u2019 Arch. Sur.

The pillars are square to about one-third their height, then octagonal, and lastly round. The shrine has been large, fully 23 feet square, domed on 12 pilasters, 18 inches by 12, with four-armed figures on the brackets. The brackets of the hall columns are plain, but above the bracket a plinth, nine or ten inches deep, is carved with a raised geometrical pattern. The fronts of the brackets are carved. The walls of the temple are of stone throughout. Over the shrine door is a Devi, probably Bhav\u00e1ni. On the pilasters to the right of the shrine is an inscription dated 1289-90 (S. 1346); of which all that is now legible are the names of Vanar\u00e1m and a few other Th\u00e1kors, probably his ancestors. Bhuvad, who gave its name to the village, is said to have been a Ch\u00e1vda chief, killed either by the K\u00e1this or by L\u00e1kha Phul\u00e1n\u00ed J\u00e1deja about 1320. His headless body is said to have fought its way to Bhuvad, where is a shrine with a red-painted headless figure. Near his shrine are tall tombstones, said to have been raised over warriors who fell in the battle in which Bhuvad was slain.\n\nChher, or \u00c1span Chher, on the coast six miles west of Lakhp\u00e1t, has a cemented tomb of bricks and mud said to contain the remains of a Sindi boy, L\u00e1l Chhatta, who was drowned while crossing the creek. After his death he appeared in a dream to the people of Chher and told them to build him a tomb, and worship him as a saint. A yearly fair is held here, when people from the surrounding villages bring their children to have their heads shaved for the first time.\n\nChitrod, near the centre of V\u00e1gad with 2508 inhabitants, has, about a mile to the north, the ruins of four temples and a reservoir built by the K\u00e1this, who, about the year 1500, were settled here in considerable numbers. One of the temples, probably dedicated to Mah\u00edsh\u00e1suri, was built of fine stone with excellent sculpture. The temples are in ruins, and most of the materials have been carried away. About a mile to the east are the remains of a pretty large K\u00e1thi town, with among them the ruins of a small plain temple of Mah\u00e1dev bearing date 1502 (S. 1559).\n\nChoba\u2019r\u00ed, a considerable village in V\u00e1gad, about fifty-three miles east of Bhuj and not far from the Ran, with 2788 inhabitants, is one of the points from which in the dry season the Ran is crossed. Here in 1783 the army of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja of Jodhpur was totally defeated by Fateh Ali T\u00e1lpur of Sind.

This is sacred to the holy Dhoramnath, who, after destroying Mandvi, repented of the loss of life, and determined to mortify the flesh by standing on his head on some lonely hill. Travelling to the north he began to climb the highest hill he could see, but it became Nanao \"weighed down\" by his sin. He chose another hill, but for it too the burden of guilt was too great and it became Jhurio \"broken down\". He chose a third hill, and climbing it backwards it bore him, and he called it Dhinodhar, \"the patience bearer\". At its highest peak, resting it on a conical stone, he stood on his head for twelve years, a Charan woman feeding him with milk. Such merit and power did this penance bring that the gods took alarm, and, sending a deputation to wait on him, asked that his penance should cease. Dhoramnath said, wherever he first looked, the country would become barren. The gods arranged that he should first look at the sea. This dried up under his gaze and left the Ran. Fearing that the death of so many fish would lose him his merit, Dhoramnath moved his eyes and looking at the hill it split into two. Then Dhoramnath came down, kindled his fire, built a monastery, and established the order of the Kanphatas. In the shrine is a red-smearred triangular conical stone in which Dhoramnath is said to have rested his head when performing penance. Outside of the shrine is the original ascetic's fire, dhuni, which is lighted three days in Bhadrapad (August - September), when the head, pir, of the monastery comes to worship and receives homage from the people of the neighbouring villages. At the foot of the hill, amongst the monastery buildings, is another temple to Dhoramnath on a raised platform facing the east, about seven feet square and with walls about seven feet high. Inside is a three feet high marble image of Dhoramnath, some small lingas, and other brass and stone images, and a lamp always kept burning. In a large shed near is an ascetic's fire, dhuni, said to have been burning since the time of Dhoramnath. In August and October, at the Gokal Ashthami and Navratra festivals, rice and wheat flour sweetened with sugar are cooked and given to the people.\n\nDinara has, about half a mile to the south, the ruins of a white-limestone Jain temple, fifty feet long by eighteen wide, said to be the place where Sadavant and Savalinga, the hero and heroine of a Gujarati romance, used to study.\n\nFatehgad, a prosperous village on the edge of the Ran in the north-east of Vagad with 3164 inhabitants, was, early in the present century, founded by, and called after, the famous minister Fateh\n\n---\n\n1 Bom.

Partially fortifying the town he made it so secure that, in a short time, he drew within its walls the people of most of the villages round. By carefully protecting from robber attacks the passage across the Ran to Gujar\u00e1t, traders came to settle at Fatehgad and a few years later, in the time of the 1823 famine, many of them made large fortunes. In 1828 it was one of the most prosperous villages in V\u00e1gad with a population of 2000 souls.\n\nGedi, a village in the north of V\u00e1gad with a population of 2770 souls, is believed to be one of the oldest towns in Cutch. One of the many towns that claim to be the Vir\u00e1t Nagar that gave shelter to the P\u00e1ndavs (1400 B.C.), it is also said to be the capital of the mythical R\u00e1ja Gadhising, who, though for a time forced to wear the form of an ass, succeeded in marrying the chief's daughter and surrounding the city with a wall of brass. Some of the ass, gadhaya, coins have been found in the ruins. In course of time the town passed into the hands of a Musalm\u00e1n named Madam. From him it was wrested by P\u00e1dariya Rajputs, and from them by V\u00e1ghel\u00e1s. This V\u00e1ghela chief seems at one time to have been very powerful and to have held the title of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1na as late as 1476 (S. 1533). Though afterwards subdued by the Jadej\u00e1s, the head of the family still has the title of R\u00e1na of Gedi. The present proprietor is nineteenth in descent from the founder.\n\nAmong objects of interest is the white-limestone temple of Mah\u00e1dev Achaleshvar, built about 300 years ago (1579), by a S\u00e1chora Br\u00e1hman Gov\u00e1l Dave. Twenty-two feet long, eight broad, and twenty-two high, it has a domed porch and a shrine, with a four-faced Mah\u00e1dev said to be taken from an old temple built by Uttara, a princess of Vir\u00e1t, and dedicated to Uuttareshvar, but long since buried. Near the temple, the M\u00e1l\u00e1n well, with half buried pillars overgrown with trees, seems to have been repaired in 1476 (S. 1533) by Thakar M\u00e1lav, the son of Makad. Though from its brackishness little used for drinking, its water is thought to be medicinal. Of Ash\u00e1ba Pir's temple close to the well, nothing remains but a platform thirty-three feet square with mouldings and two ruined tombs. Mah\u00e1virji's temple is a terraced building, twenty-eight feet by twenty, with a large verandah in front of four shrines, and a central dome supported by sixteen pillars. In the central room are three marble images, Mah\u00e1vir in the middle, and on either side the images of \u00c1dishvar Bhagv\u00e1n and of Sh\u00e1ntin\u00e1th the fifth Tirthankar.\n\n---\n\n1 Sir A. Burnes' MS. 1828.\n2 Gedi appears to be a corruption of Ghritaghadya which is found in two inscriptions: one near Ray, dated 1271 (S. 1328), where it is mentioned as a large district under M\u00e1ldev, a Viceroy of Arjundev king of Anhilv\u00e1da; and the other in the inscription on the M\u00e1l\u00e1n well (see below). The name would seem to mean the land, ghadya or padya of butter, ghrit or ghi. The legend is that a merchant of Anhilv\u00e1de in want of clarified butter, ghi, stole it by magic from M\u00e1lav's warehouse, and afterwards offered the value. This M\u00e1lav refused as the stolen butter had been replaced by means of M\u00e1lav's magic ring. On being assured that butter had been filched, he took the money, and with it built the temple, the well, and the pond. Bom. Gov. Sel. CLII. (New Series), 65, 70.\n3 Bom. Gov. Sel. CLII.

This temple is said to have been built by a V\u00e1nia named M\u00e1lov, who, according to the local story, owned a straw ring that had the virtue of re-filling an empty butter pail. Amassing wealth by therings's help he built Mah\u00e1vir's temple, the M\u00e1lan well, and the M\u00e1lsar pond. The temple of Lakshmin\u00e1r\u00e1yan, a pyramidal shrine with two domed porches, thirty-six feet long, twenty feet broad and forty feet high, was built in 1840 (S. 1897) on the site of an old temple said to have been buried by the 1819 earthquake. Inside, a marble image of Lakshmin\u00e1r\u00e1yan, about 1\u00bd feet high, replaces a handsome old four feet high image of Dasavat\u00e1r, mutilated by Sarfar\u00e1z of Sind in 1775, and now lying outside. This image with that of Suraj N\u00e1r\u00e1yan, now lying in one of the niches, belonged to the old temple which is said to have been built by the P\u00e1ndavs. In another niche is a sandstone image of Ganpati having an inscription dated 1618 (S. 1675). Under an old jar tree in the market place is a three feet high carved stone image of Kshetrap\u00e1l. On its pedestal is an inscription of two lines of which only the year 1211 (S. 1268) is legible. It is said to have been placed there by the Makv\u00e1na Rajputs at the time of their settlement.\n\nGhola'y, under the Ch\u00e1vd\u00e1s known as Sarasgar Pattan, was, until superseded by Jakh\u00e1n, a place of some importance. There are still some objects of interest. Among them, about a mile west of Ghola'y, is a domed stone and brick building, twenty-six feet square and twenty-eight high, said to be the tomb of Mod the son of Jakhara, and to have been built in the fourteenth century by his son J\u00e1m Man\u00e1\u00ed II.\n\nGundiy\u00e1li, on the coast near M\u00e1ndvi with 4046 inhabitants, has, on high ground surrounded by large banyan trees and seen for several miles, a handsome temple sacred to R\u00e1val Pir, rebuilt in 1819 (S. 1876) by Seths Sundariji and Jetha Shivji. R\u00e1val, said to have been born in the fourteenth century from a blister in the palm of his mother's hand, gained a name for destroying at Jakh\u00e1u a number of Musalm\u00e1n missionaries who disturbed the devotees of Dhoramn\u00e1th. He afterwards came to Gundiy\u00e1li, then in the possession of a Dal Rajput named Der\u00e1j, and helped him against the R\u00e1thods. Once a year many Musalm\u00e1ns and H\u00edndus come, make vows, and hang flower garlands round the necks of the stone-horses that are ranged about the temple.\n\nGunthli, a small village about thirty-six miles north-west of Bhuj, has the ruins of a walled city rising boldly from the Dharur river. The line of the walls, 2250 yards round and something of an oblong square in shape, though much decayed may be clearly traced. Inside is nothing but a heap of ruins, the remains of houses\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Sel. CLII. (New Series), 68, 70.\n2 Bom. Gov. Sel. CLII. (New Series), 45.\n3 Bom. Gov. Sel. CLII.

An old Mah\u00e1dev temple was believed to hold snake-guarded treasure.\\(^1\\) On the bank of a small lake to the west of the fort, seven grave stones, p\u00e1l\u00edas, with peculiar designs but no writing, are said to have been raised in honour of seven claimants for the hand of Guntri the adopted sister of the seven S\u00e1nds, once the rulers of the fort.\\(^2\\) It was from these seven S\u00e1nds, probably early in the fourteenth century, that the Samm\u00e1s captured the fort and made themselves masters of western Cutch. The story is that Mod and Man\u00e1\u00ed, two Samma outlaws from Sind, by treachery gained possession of V\u00e1gham-Ch\u00e1v\u00e9d\u00e1gad ten miles north of Kora near Lakhpat. V\u00e1gham Ch\u00e1vda, whom the Samm\u00e1s killed, was a vassal of the seven S\u00e1nds. They at first threatened punishment, but were appeased by the offer of a larger tribute and of one of the Samma brothers as hostage. Part of the tribute was paid in grass, and one year the Samm\u00e1s, in each cart of grass, hid some armed men. As the carts passed through the city gate, the blind gatekeeper smelling something more than grass, said, \u2018There is either flesh or pulse in the cart.\u2019 A spear driven into one cart cut the thigh of a Jat soldier. But he, uttering no sound of pain, as the spear was pulled out rubbed off the blood, and, in spite of the blind man\u2019s warning, the carts passed in. At night the armed men left the carts, fell on the garrison, seized the fort, and drove the seven S\u00e1nds into K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r.\\(^3\\)\n\nJakha\u2019u, a seaport town with 5145 inhabitants, in north latitude \\(23^\\circ 13'\\) and east longitude \\(68^\\circ 43'\\),\\(^4\\) stands on the south-west coast of Cutch, more than sixty miles west of Bhuj. The town, rather poverty-stricken with scattered stone houses, lies between three and four miles inland in a dreary plain bare of trees but yielding good crops. Close to the landing place and along the banks of the Godia creek, though the road is at all times passable, the land is lowlying and marshy. The landing place is on Godia creek five miles from the sea. With a muddy bed, this creek, dry at low water, has at full tide a depth of from eight to twelve feet, and, at springs, boats of from twenty to twenty-five tons (60-70 kh\u00e1ndis) can pass. Three miles from the landing place, a second and distinct creek, following the curve of the coast, runs to Koteshvar, the landing place at the east mouth of the Indus, and forms a natural canal joining Jakh\u00e1u with the Indus. This backwater is known as Bagda, and the mile or two broad strip of land between the canal and the sea as Bagtari. In the backwater the daily tides rise (1828) from five to six feet, and all the year round make the creek navigable for craft of from eight to ten tons (25-30 kh\u00e1ndis). Several small rivers run toward this creek, the largest of them entering it two and a half miles north.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Sir A. Burnes\u2019 MS. 1828  \n\\(^2\\) Bom. Gov. Sel. CLII.

The Indus boats that frequent this creek are chiefly from Shahbandar, and Maghribi. About two miles south-east of the Jakhau creek, another backwater called the Siri, runs inland to the east for about six miles. This, rocky and with only one entrance, is useless for traffic. Jakhau carries on a large trade with Bombay, exporting field produce and importing piece-goods, groceries, and timber. Vessels lying about four miles from the landing place discharge into small boats, and from the small boats goods are carried in carts to the neighbouring towns of Naliya, Tera, and Kothara. In 1828, with 490 houses and a population of 2116 souls, 1098 Hindus and 1018 Musalmans, Jakhau carried on a considerable trade, importing from Bombay dates, sugar, and oil, and from Sind a coarse red rice. There was also a slight traffic with Maskat and Daman.\n\nJara.\n\nJara, a hamlet forty-five miles north-west of Bhuj, at the foot of a hill of the same name, with a population of 35 souls, is the scene of the great battle in which (1762) Ghulam Shah of Sind defeated and destroyed the Cutch army.\n\nJuran.\n\nJuran has, three miles to the north, about twenty miles north-west of Bhuj, a great mangrove tree known as the Kavdiacher. The stem, twenty-one feet from the ground, is from five to ten feet round and the whole tree covers an area of about 105 square yards.\n\nKanthkot.\n\nKanthkot, in Vagad in east Cutch, an old fort on the top of an isolated rocky hill about three miles in circumference, has walls built of massive blocks repaired in many places by smaller stones. It is said, in the eighth century, to have been the capital of the Kaths and to have been taken from them by the Chavdas. According to the local story the present fort was begun about 843 (S. 900). A part of the wall crossed the fireplace of the great ascetic Kanthadhath, who in anger destroyed it. Then the builders appeasing the ascetic called the fort after his name, and were allowed to finish it. About the middle of the tenth century, under the name Kanthadurg, it appears as the place to which Mulraj of Anhilvada fled when pressed (950) by Tailap of Kalyan Ketah. In the eleventh century (1024) it is believed to be the fort Khandaba, forty parasangas.\n\n---\n\n1 Maghribi is the capital of the district situated on the Sirnar, a freshwater branch of the Indus said to be twenty-four miles beyond the Rakanoj Kadev.

About the middle of the twelfth century (1143) the R\u00e1ja of Kanth\u00e1g\u00e1m, probably Kanthkot, from the west is mentioned as joining the Nagor chief against Kum\u00e1r P\u00e1l Solanki (1143-1174) of Anhilv\u00e1da. In the thirteenth century it was the capital of the V\u00e1ghel\u00e1s, from whom, about the close of the century (1270), it was taken by Mod and Man\u00e1i Samma. In the beginning of the fifteenth century (1410) it was besieged by Muzaflar (1390-1411). It afterwards passed to the Deda branch of the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s, and at the close of the sixteenth century is mentioned by Abul Fazl as one of the chief Cutch forts. In 1816 it surrendered to a British detachment under Colonel East, when the fortifications were razed to the ground. In the west of the hill in a ravine are two large deep wells and one ruined step-well built of blocks of sandstone. On the hill are the remains of three temples, one to the ascetic Kanthadn\u00e1th, the second an old Jain temple to Mah\u00e1vir, the third a temple to the Sun.\n\nKanthadn\u00e1th\u2019s shrine on the west point of the hill was, about 1820, built by Deda J\u00e1dej\u00e1s in the place of a much larger temple, probably the work of Mod Samma (1270), ruined by the 1819 earthquake. The present shrine, built on a high platform, is domed and measures 28 feet by 14 and 28 high. It has a fine domed porch supported on four pillars, and inside a white marble image of Kanthadn\u00e1th sitting cross-legged. The much ruined temple of Mah\u00e1vir has had a double entrance hall, mandap. A writing on a pillar in the entrance hall dated 1283 (S. 1340) states that the builders were \u00c1tm\u00e1devn\u00e1th\u2019s sons, L\u00e1kha and Sohi. On a pilaster in the screen on the outside, \u00c1tm\u00e1dev\u2019s son P\u00e1sil is said to be the builder. The family who built the temple are believed to be relatives of Jagdusha of Bhadresar. Close to the Jain ruin is an old temple to the Sun, surya, the K\u00e1th\u00eds\u2019 favourite god. There is a writing, described as an incorrect stringing together of the praises of Shiv under the incarnation of Rudra. The temple still contains the image of the Sun god, represented with a male and female attendant on each side. The figure is much like that of Vishnu. Near a more modern shrine on the wall are a number of graves of Shaiv Atits, some of unusual form, a ling mounted on a series of round or square plinths laid one over the other.\n\nKata'riya, north latitude 23\u00b0 5\u2032 and east longitude 70\u00b0 42\u2032, lies on the south-east coast of V\u00e1gad about eleven miles north-west of M\u00e1lia in K\u00e1thi\u00e1war.

Above ground are the remains of three domed porches, each with five well carved pillars. Under ground, reached by a stone ladder, is a chamber, the roof supported by five pillars and scalloped arches. On the side of the doorway is a figure of Ganpati. On the bank of a pool in the west of the village is a small plain sandstone temple. This, dedicated to Mah\u00e1dev Bhadeshvar, about ten feet square and fourteen high, has a roof rising in a pyramid of steps. The portico, mandap, is incomplete. A writing on the lintel of the entrance door states that it was built in 1682 (S. 1739) in the time of Kunvar Shri Rav\u00e1ji by a Bhatia named Vastup\u00e1l, probably the chief's manager. On the bank of the pond are two sati tombstones, one dated 1627 (S. 1684), the other 1707 (S. 1764).\u00b9\n\nKERA.\n\nKera, on the M\u00e1ndvi road about twelve miles south of Bhuj, a village of about 2057 inhabitants, is a convenient halting place, with a large and strong fort, and a considerable trade in cloth and ironware.\u00b2 It has three objects of interest; the ruins of an old Hindu fort and temple, and the shrine of a modern Musalm\u00e1n saint. Much interest attaches to the ruins, as they are said to be the remains of the capital of L\u00e1kha Phul\u00e1ni the great Cutch hero. Close search among the ruins and tombstones has failed to throw any light on the much disputed point of L\u00e1kha's date. Tradition places him about the ninth century, but the more trustworthy Musalm\u00e1n records would, unless there was more than one famous chief of the same name, place him somewhere in the 13th or 14th century. The old Shaiv temple, built perhaps at the end of the tenth century, is of hard lasting stone partly red partly yellow. Except the shrine and spire, the temple was thrown down by the 1819 earthquake. The shrine measures 8 feet 6 inches square inside, with walls 2 feet 7 inches thick, surrounded by a path 2 feet 6 inches wide, lighted by two open cut-stone windows. Of the hall, which was 18 feet 9 inches wide, only a part of the north wall with one window is left. The wall sculptures, though not numerous, are well executed, and on the faces of the spire is an elaborately cut ornament representing the outlines of a chaitya window, repeated over a triangular face, with human figures between. Of these triangles of sculpture there are eight on each side, gradually lessening as they rise higher one behind the other. The corners of the shrine are surmounted by miniature spires, and above them are other four similar, but set further inwards; above these and the sculpture, rises the massive outline of the great central spire all beautifully carved.\u00b3 South-east of Kera, a small village, on a pretty rising ground, has the well-wooded shrine of the saint Ghul\u00e1m Ali. Within the enclosure are three chief buildings, a mausoleum, darq\u00e1h, with a tomb under a canopy, supported by twelve small Muhammadan columns. Against the pall lies the\n\n\u00b9 Hamilton's Description of Hindust\u00e1n, I. 602; Bom. Gov. Sel. CLII.

In the middle of the quadrangle, in front of the mausoleum, stands a canopy, chhatra, with a flat roof and side balconies and a tombless mausoleum to D\u00e1di Ali Sh\u00e1h. The doors have projecting shields between floral ornaments, like those found at Maiji S\u00e1hiba's tomb at Jun\u00e1gad and on the palace at Nav\u00e1nagar in K\u00e1thi\u00e1war. The windows are of pierced stone of very simple patterns. These tombs were built about eighty years ago by the Khoj\u00e1s of Kera in honour of a local saint, Pir Ghul\u00e1m Ali Sh\u00e1h Kadw\u00e1l, a descendant of Pir Sadr-ud-din, who, about 400 years ago, converted many Cutch and Gujar\u00e1t Hindus to the branch of the Ism\u00e1\u00edlian Shia faith, whose chief priest is H. H. \u00c1ga Kh\u00e1n. Pir S\u00e1dr-ud-din would seem to have grafted a Hindu element on the Ism\u00e1\u00edlian beliefs. This he worked into a book styled the Das\u00e1vat\u00e1r or ten incarnations, nine being the incarnations of Vishnu and the tenth being that of the most holy Ali. Ghul\u00e1m Ali the Kera saint, first settled at Kadi in Gujar\u00e1t. Passing through Cutch in 1792 he came to Kera, and, liking the place and finding the people friendly, settled there. By clearing of spirits a haunted hill close to the village his fame spread. He raised a building called the Panchtan sacred to the five, Ali, Fatima, Hassan, Hussain, and Muhammad. About four years later (1796) Ghul\u00e1m Ali died in Kurrachee. The Khoj\u00e1s of Kurrachee wished to bury him there. But he appeared in a dream and told one of his followers that his body had already passed to Kera. Somewhat doubting, they opened the coffin, and, finding only rose leaves, sent the coffin to Kera where it was received with great ceremony and a tomb built. Hearing of her husband's death, his wife, Aj\u00e1n Bibi, came from Gujar\u00e1t and settled in Kera. Losing her son in 1807 she renounced the world and spent the rest of her life as an ascetic, endowing an alms-house, sad\u00e1vrat, where, to the destitute of all castes and creeds, daily doles of grain are still given. Aj\u00e1n Bibi died in 1827 (S. 1884). Both this lady and her husband Ghul\u00e1m Ali continued Sadr-ud-din's work of adding to the Hindu element in their form of faith. He wrote a work, and she some hymns, kirtan, on spiritual knowledge, brahm\u00e1dy\u00e1n. They are both said to have paid great respect to the Hindu religion, and, within their lands, to have forbidden the taking of animal life. In their honour on the 11th of the bright half of Ch\u00e1itra (March - April) a fair is held lasting for a week. It was begun in 1796 by Khoja L\u00e1dak Sum\u00e1r of Ghogha in Cutch. The Khoja community of Kera manage the charitable institutions and keep an account of the presents received from the followers, murids.

On the birth of prince Desal I. (1718-1741) the Samm\u00e1s of Pachham, anxious to show their loyalty, offered the R\u00e1o as much land as a cart coming from Bhuj could pass over in one day. The Samm\u00e1s would seem to have miscalculated the distance, as the cart passed through S\u00e1ndh\u00e1ra, Andhau, Kh\u00e1ri, Dh\u00e1l\u00fa\u00e1ra, Godpar, Ludia, and Kh\u00e1vda, and it was only by bribing the driver to stop that any of their island was left.\n\nKhokra, or Khakra, about a mile south of Kanthkot, has in waste bush land two ruined Shaiv temples. The shrine of the more easterly building has a fine door, evidently old, of hard compact stone, with a chaitya window ornament over each jamb and over the different compartments of the lintel. In the centre of the lintel in very spirited style is a carving of Brahma on the left and Vishnu on the right. Some well sculptured pillars lie about.\n\nKora, a village about ten miles south-east of Lakhpat on the way to M\u00e1ndvi in a hilly country containing large quantities of iron ore, had in 1820 two or three smelting furnaces. The work has long been stopped but traces still remain. On a raised platform with a flag staff, a stone, in memory of Pir Aliy\u00e1ji, is held in great respect by the people of Kora, who make vows to him and offer opium and sugarcandy. Out of respect to the saint, except the temples none of the Kora buildings are painted or tiled. The story of Aliy\u00e1ji, who was the grandson of Kheng\u00e1rji (1548 - 1585), is that, after his right to Bhuj was usurped by his uncle Bh\u00e1rm\u00e1lji, he retired to S\u00e1bhr\u00e1i where he built the Aliy\u00e1sar lake. Latterly, settling at Kora, he led a roving life. One day he stole some buffaloes from a Sind ascetic named Buransh\u00e1h, and, refusing to give them back, was cursed by the saint and died.\n\nKota'i, on the shore of the Ran about twelve miles north of Bhuj, has the remains of an old city and several ruined temples of perhaps the earlier part of the tenth century. The Sun temple, known as Ra L\u00e1kha's and ascribed to L\u00e1kha Phul\u00e9ni, facing the west is, without cement, partly built of yellow and partly of red stone. The aisles are covered by groins like the aisles in some chaitya caves; the nave is roofed the same way as at the Amarn\u00e1th temple, the central area being covered with massive slabs hollowed out in the centre, in which a pondentive has been inserted. Outside it has a slanting roof divided into four sections of slightly different heights, that next to the spire being the highest, and the remote end the lowest. The door of the temple is neatly carved. Over the lintel are the nine patrons of the planets, and the jambs are carefully sculptured. In the entrance hall, mandap, are four pillars with a square block sculptured below the bracket, and six pilasters. The shafts support a plinth, on which stands a block carved with colonnettes at the corners. The faces of the block are sculptured with figures of men.\n\n---\n\n1 Thornton's East India Gazetteer, 529; Sir A. Burnes' MS. 1828.\n2 Burgess' Arch. Sur.

The pillars and pilasters are all of the Hindu broken-square form. The shrine door is elaborately carved with two rows of figures on the frieze, Ganpati on the lintel, and the jambs richly ornamented. The area behind the central jamb is roofed with large slabs, carved with sixteen figures linked in one another\u2019s arms in a circle, the legs crossed and turned towards the centre. Each holds a rod in either hand, the left hand being bent down and the right up, and so interlaced with the arms of the figures on either side. The roofs of the three aisles, at the side and in front of the central area, are very prettily carved with flowered ribs, and three horizontal bands inclusive of that from which they spring. In two neat niches advanced from the front wall of the shrine, and with two colonnettes in front of each there have been standing images in alto-relievo neatly canopied by a lotus flower with buds growing over the head dresses.\n\nTo the west of the temple of the Sun, are three small temples, two facing the east, and one, the north. That facing the north is a very small Vaishnav temple, with only a fragment of the shrine remaining. Of the east-facing temples, one has only the shrine left; on the walls are carved figures of Surya on the west face, and sardulas in the recesses. Varah has fallen off the south wall, and there is a figure of Ganpati on the lintel. Of the other temple, part of the porch as well as the shrine remains. Over the head of the shrine door are carved the patrons of the nine planets. Outside on the north wall is Narsinha and on the west Vishnu, both much time-worn. Across a ravine to the north-east are fragments of two other temples facing west. Of the first and higher, only the plain square pillars of the hall and the lower part of the shrine are standing. The door is surrounded by an architrave of three members, two fasciae carved with creeper pattern, and a cyma recta with leaves. On the lintel is a Ganpati, and outside two weather-worn figures. The lower ruin is a fragment of the shrine of a Surya temple, with Ganpati on the lintel, and the nine planets on the frieze. There are no figures outside. On this part of the hill, foundations show that whole edifices must have been carted away for building purposes.\n\nKoteshvar, the ten million gods, a small seaport with a population of 329 souls, near the mouth of the Kori river, in the west of Cutch, is by tidal creeks almost entirely cut off from the mainland. It is supposed to be Hiouen Thsang\u2019s (640) \u2018Kie-tsi-shi-fa-lo on the western frontier of the country close to the river Indus and to the great ocean.\u2019 The city was five miles (30 li) round; there were eighty convents with about 5000 devotees chiefly of the school of the Sammityas, and a\n\n---\n\n1 Burgess\u2019 Arch.

CLII., (New Series) 25.\n4 Cunningham\u2019s Ancient Geography of India, I. 303.\ndozen temples of the gods, dev\u00e1lay\u00e1s, where ash-smeared heretics lived. In the middle of the city was the temple of Maheshvar, adorned with sculpture and with a miracle-working statue worshipped by ash-smeared heretics. Except some temples, Koteshvar shows few signs of its former greatness. The temples, on a sandstone mound about a mile to the north-west of the village, rising boldly from the sea that washes their western face, are enclosed by a fortified wall, the gate approached by three flights of steps. A writing on the left side of the gate shows that the present fort and temples were built in 1820 (S. 1877) by two Seths, Sundarji and Jetha Shivji, Brahma-Kshatris by caste. The courtyard is surrounded by a battlemented wall armed with three small guns. In the middle, on a platform 4\u00bd feet high 63\u00bd long and 49 broad, is a handsomely built stone temple of Mah\u00e1dev. The porch has three domes with, under the central dome, a large and beautiful brass bull presented by R\u00e1o Desalji (1718 - 1741); in the right dome a large statue of Hanum\u00e1n; and in the left dome one of Ganpati. Inside the porch is the hall, mandap, 19 feet 9 inches long and 24 feet 8 inches wide, with a large central and two side domes. On a marble tablet, let into the centre of the hall floor, the names of Kshatri Jetha and Sundarji Shivji are humbly cut that the feet of the worshippers may tread on them. At the inner end of the hall and between it and the shrine are, on either side, figures of Ganpati and Hanum\u00e1n. In the screen wall of the shrine are two inscriptions referring to the recent (1820) rebuilding of the temple. The frame of the door is of carved stone. The door itself, 2\u00bd feet wide and 12\u00be high, is plated with carved silver. The shrine, paved with black marble, is 11\u00bd feet square. In the back wall is an image of P\u00e1rvati, and in the west wall are two images of Ganpati and Rev\u00e1ji. In the centre of a basin, jal\u00e1dh\u00e1r\u00ed, rather far back in the shrine, is a four feet high ling of the kind called self-born, svayambhu. In the point of the ling are some iron nails driven into it, according to the local story, by Ala-ud-din Khilji (1295 - 1315).\n\nOn the site of this modern temple there stood an older building, one of whose stones is said to have borne an inscription to the effect that it was built by the Kers of Ghol\u00e1y. This stone has disappeared, but among the Kers, who are now a Musalm\u00e1n clan, the story that their forefathers built the temple still remains. At the time of rebuilding the temple (1820) the foundation of the east wall was kept and it was enlarged on the west. The change so altered the position of the ling that it was no longer under the central lotus. This was said to be ominous to the ruler, and in 1863 (S. 1920) R\u00e1o Pr\u00e1gmalji, when he visited the temple, ordered a silver canopy to be placed over the ling. By the R\u00e1o\u2019s death the work was stayed before the plans were finished. In ancient times the temple priest was a devotee of the ear-slitting or K\u00e1mphati sect. But for sixteen successions the office has been in the hands of Atits. The yearly revenue from lands granted by the R\u00e1o and others, one of whom\n\n---\n\n1 Julien\u2019s Hiouen Thsang, 303.\nis said to have been a Musalm\u00e1n, is about \u00a3791 (30,000 koris). The holy man used to live at Dhun\u00e1y three miles east of Koteshvar, then a flourishing town of 6000 souls. He is said to have moved to the present spot in the fifteenth century, when the Brahmach\u00e1ri of N\u00e1r\u00e1yansar established his power.\n\nClose to the chief Koteshvar shrine is a smaller temple, built by the same men and about the same time in honour of Kaly\u00e1neshvar. From the fort a paved causeway, twelve feet broad and used as a pier by country craft, runs out for 520 feet. At the end is a square reservoir filled by every high tide, where Hindus perform the shr\u00e1ddh ceremony and bathe. On the middle of the pier is a square platform, kotha, on which is built the temple of Nilkanth, now known as Saraneshvar, facing the west with a porch and a small Musalm\u00e1n dome. It is said to have been originally built in the thirteenth century by God R\u00e1ni who had come to marry Ra Kanoj, but some difference arising, she went to Sind and married L\u00e1kha Ghur\u00e1ra. It was rebuilt by Mah\u00e1kunvar, wife of Desalji I. (1718 - 1741), and repaired by Kshatri Jetha and Sundarji Shivji. It was again, in 1857, repaired by Gos\u00e1i Dolatgarji Rev\u00e1gar Kunvargar at a cost of about \u00a3200 (7800 koris).\n\nAcross the Kori from Koteshvar, about nine miles to the north-west, is the tomb of Ra Kanoj built in 1773 (S.1830), twenty feet long by sixteen broad and twenty-eight high, with one large central and four corner domes. Ra Kanoj is said to be the son of the daughter of Ra Bhalot, chief of Ujain, who, about the end of the ninth century, in a fight with a Musalm\u00e1n army, was killed at Sekot a small fort half a mile north-east of N\u00e1r\u00e1yansar. The priests of the shrine used to be sailors of the Bhad\u00e1la caste, now they are Jats.\n\nKoth\u00e1'ra, in south Cutch about twelve miles south-east of Jakh\u00e1u with 3673 inhabitants, is a prosperous town with a very good girls\u2019 school, new handsome dwellings, and a well-to-do class of traders, who, natives of Cutch, have made money in Bombay, Zanzib\u00e1r, and other trade centres, and brought it back to spend in their own land. They keep up the credit of the proprietor of the village by lending him money; they found and endow schools, build temples, dig wells and ponds, and in Bombay fashion, raise high dwellings gaudy and staring with overhanging verandahs, glazed windows, gay shutters, and tiled roofs. In this village was finished in 1861 (S. 1918) the richest of modern Cutch temples. Of \u00a340,000, the whole cost of the building, one-half was given by Sh\u00e1h Velji M\u00e1lu and the other in equal shares by Sh\u00e1h Keshavji N\u00e1yak and Shivji Nensi, Osv\u00e1l V\u00e1ni\u00e1s of Koth\u00e1ra now living in Bombay. This temple, dedicated to Sh\u00e1ntin\u00e1th the sixteenth of the Jain saints, was, after the style of one in Ahmedabad, built by Cutch workmen under the superintendence of Sal\u00e1t Nathu of S\u00e1bhr\u00e1\u00ed. Through a very rich two-storied entrance gate, an outer yard,\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Sol. CLII, (New Series), 25, 27, 29,\n2 Col. Barton's Tour in Cutch (Feb. 1878), 22.\nsurrounded by buildings set apart for the use of priests, opens into a walled quadrangle with a shrine in each wall. In the centre of the quadrangle, on a plinth six feet nine inches high reached by a flight of fifteen steps, is the temple, 78 feet long 69 wide and 73\u00bd high, supported on three sides by rich two-storied domed porches. The domed hall, mandap, rises in two stories, and over the shrine is a spire with richly carved figures, niches, and mouldings. Inside, the hall, mandap, surrounded by aisles or verandahs, with a richly designed pavement of different coloured marbles, has twenty-two pilasters, and sixteen pillars, and a dome supported on eight pillars with foiled arches and struts. Inside of a wall, chiefly formed of twenty pillars richly carved with flowers, leaves and creepers, is the shrine, where, supported on either side by seven small figures, is a large image of Sh\u00e1ntin\u00e1th crowned with a golden crown, and seated cross-legged on a richly carved marble throne. The upper story of the hall, reached by stone steps from the south-west porches, has a corridor with rich shrines each containing a large marble sitting image. Below the hall there is an underground shrine, with about twenty-five large white marble figures with precious stones let into the eyes, chests, and arms. Besides the underground shrine there is a secret cellar especially prepared against a time of trouble.\n\nLa'kadiya, a walled town twelve miles from Vond, is said to have been settled about 300 years ago (1578) by Osvalds from Kanthkot and Kat\u00e1riya. The town has a saint known as the Lakadiya Pir, who has a cloth-covered tomb, 38\u00bd feet long by three broad, and a tower, forty-four feet high and thirty feet round, crowned with a domed canopy.\n\nLakhp\u00e1t, called after R\u00e1o L\u00e1kha who ruled in Sind about the middle of the thirteenth century, in north latitude 23\u00b0 49' and east longitude 68\u00b0 49', is a town of 2500 inhabitants in the extreme north-west of Cutch on the left bank of the Kori river, seventy-one miles north-west from Bhuj. In a barren plain of bare limestone rock, the towers and walls of Lakhp\u00e1t stand high and imposing. Inside the walls the huddled poverty-stricken houses fill less than half the space. Westward lies a wide stretch of mud and water in which, about a mile and a half off, on a slightly raised mud heap, is the landing place. Within historic times Lakhp\u00e1t has had only one very short period of prosperity. Fateh Muhammed, about the close of the eighteenth century, enlarged and rebuilt its wall, and here for a time great part of the trade of Sind centred. Though he thought it one of the chief supports of his power, Lakhp\u00e1t declared against Fateh Muhammed when he opposed the R\u00e1o in 1804. A few years later (1809), the commandant of the fort, Mohim Miyan, drove\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Sel. CLII. (New Series), 19-21.\n2 The tower was built by J\u00e1deja Dev\u00e1ji in 1759 (S.1816). Bom.

In 1826, when visited by Dr. Burnes, there were not more than 6000 inhabitants, consisting chiefly of mercantile speculators from other countries and families of Hindus driven from Sind. The walls were in good repair, but the houses were ruined and did not fill one-third of the area.\\(^3\\) In 1851 all trade had left the town, and it has since remained poverty-stricken and half deserted.\\(^4\\)\n\nThe fort is an irregular polygon, defended by round towers and built of hard brown stone. The walls are of considerable height but not thick.\\(^5\\) Except the fort the only object of interest is the tomb of Gosh Muhammad, a Syed of Lakhp\u00e1t, half-Musalm\u00e1n half-Hindu in his customs, who was believed to have supernatural power. Dying in 1855, his brother B\u00e1va Mia or Sa S\u00e1heb, from contributions made by Gosh Muhammad\u2019s followers, began to build a tomb. This tomb, of black stone, on a platform fifty-four feet square and seven high, rising in a conical dome 63 feet 3 inches high, is octagonal in shape, with four side doors arched and richly carved, and the walls decorated with patterns of flowers and leaves. Inside, the floor is paved with white and black marble, and the grave is covered with a white marble canopy. On the walls are passages from the Kur\u00e1n.\\(^6\\) It is still unfinished.\n\nMadh, or Ma\u2019ta\u2019no Madh, a village of 250 houses, in north latitude 23\u00b0 32\u2019, about fifty-five miles north-west of Bhuj and twenty-four south-east of Lakhp\u00e1t, lies surrounded by hills on both banks of a small stream. Interest attaches to Madh as the chief seat of the alum manufacture, and as the head-quarters of the K\u00e1pidis, a sect of some local religious importance. Of the making of alum some account has been already given.\\(^7\\) The pits are on the north and east of the village on the bank of a small stream.\\(^8\\) In a dell near the village is a temple of \u00c1sh\u00e1pura M\u00e1ta. To this deity, the household goddess of the R\u00e1o of Cutch, a temple is said to have been built in the beginning of the 14th century by two Kar\u00e1d V\u00e1ni\u00e1s, Ajo and Anagor, ministers of the father of L\u00e1kha Phul\u00e1ni. This, destroyed by the earthquake of 1819, was rebuilt in 1823 (S. 1880) by Brahma-Kshatri Sundarji Shivji and Mehta Valabhji. The temple is 58 feet long 32 broad and 52 high, and, except that it has a passage for walking round the god, is much the same as the temple at Koteshyar.

Here every year during the Navar\u00e1tra the R\u00e1o offers a sacrifice of seven male buffaloes. Connected with this temple are two classes of people known as Bhuv\u00e1s and K\u00e1pd\u00eds, who, though now very different, are said to be sprung from two brothers. The Bhuv\u00e1s, though not devotees, enjoy the temple revenues and live a life of ease in the village. They (1827) marry, wear long beards, and eat with all except the lowest castes. The K\u00e1pd\u00eds are devotees who do not marry, wear no hair on their faces, and eat only among themselves. According to their own account, they came from Gujar\u00e1t about 1800 years ago, and of this, they say, they had evidence as late as the battle of J\u00e1ra (1762), when, leaving their villages, they lost their records. They are chiefly Loh\u00e1n\u00e1s, but all, except outcastes, are allowed to join. About 200 years ago the succession to the headship of the monastery was disputed, and, on reference to the R\u00e1o, it was decided that one of the claimants should be head or R\u00e1ja, and the other with the title Ror\u00e1si be head elect. This custom has ever since been kept up. The R\u00e1ja and all, except twenty-five K\u00e1pd\u00eds, live in one court and take their meals together. The Ror\u00e1si with his twenty-five disciples lives separate, but receives every necessary of life from the R\u00e1ja's house. If the Ror\u00e1si dies the eldest of his disciples succeeds. If the R\u00e1ja dies the Ror\u00e1si succeeds and the eldest of the R\u00e1ja's disciples becomes Ror\u00e1si. The R\u00e1ja is treated with much respect and has the privilege of receiving the R\u00e1o of Cutch sitting. They are a well-to-do community owning the villages of Madh, Netra, Murch-b\u00e1nu, Kotda, and Dedarani. These revenues and the gifts of rich pilgrims enable them to feed every man, woman, and child of any caste or religion that passes through their village.\n\nOn the top of J\u00e1gora, a hill about two miles to the north of M\u00e1t\u00e1no Madh, in a small cave entered by a narrow opening, is a rough red coloured stone. This, the J\u00e1gora \u00c1shapura, is visited by V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s who come and stay three nights. A bituminous earth found in the hill is burnt before the goddess. The smell is unsavoury, but it pleases the goddess, as it is produced from the body of a giant or Daitya whom she slew. On a hill to the north-east is a second temple to \u00c1sh\u00e1pura built by a K\u00e1pd\u00ed in 1743 (S. 1800). Near the village is another shrine, the temple of Ch\u00e1chara M\u00e1ta. The lower part of the building is hewn out of a sandstone rock, and the roof is supported by rough carved pillars. Except by a lamp always kept burning, the inside is unlighted. From the same rock a stream of water falls into a twenty feet square pool with flights of steps. It is fifteen to twenty feet deep, and the water, which is charged with salts of sulphur, is used for bathing, washing clothes, and in the manufacture of alum.\n\nMajal, or Manjal, a village seventeen miles west of Bhuj, has, about two miles to the north-west, in a low country surrounded by hills\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Sel. CLII. (New Series), 40.\n2 Bom. Gov. Sel. CLII. (New Series), 40, 41; MacMurdo, Trans. Bom. Lit. Soc. III. 210.\nand overgrown with bushes, the ruins of Punvar\u00e1nogad, Padhargad, or Patan, still showing traces of having once been a large well-peopled city. Here, in 1830, a great number of Indo-Sassanian coins were found buried in a copper vessel. The walls, 2385 yards round, are easily traced, though all the masonry, except one narrow gateway on the west, has gone to decay. Within the walls are the ruins of two palaces, a mint, and a temple of Mah\u00e1dev, all of stone without any trace of wood. In style they closely resemble the Kera ruins. Punvar\u00e1nogad's story is that it was built about a thousand years ago (878) by one Punvar son of Gh\u00e1a or Gh\u00e1v, the chief of Kera in Cutch.\n\nQuarrelling with his family, Punvar, whose chief characteristic seems to have been cruelty, resolved to found a city and call it after his own name. When the city was finished, the architect was rewarded by having both his hands chopped off that he might not do work like it for any one else. Soon after, seven devotees renowned for their virtues and miracles came from Rum-Sh\u00e1m (Anatolia and Syria), and settled in a high hill near Punvar\u00e1nogad. Hearing of their fame Punvar's childless queen had an underground passage dug from the palace to the devotees' hill. Helping them in the service of their god Yaksh, or Jakh, she after six months prayed them to ask the god to give her a son. But, for her husband's sins, until a sacrifice was offered in the palace, the prayer could not be granted. By the underground passage the holy men entered the palace and were performing their rites when Punvar, hearing there were strange men in the women's rooms, forced his way in, seized the devotees, and set them with bare feet to tread out corn in a threshing floor bristling with harrow-spikes. Pitying their sufferings a friendly barber offered to take the place of one of them, while he went to call Yaksh to their aid. Yaksh, from western Asia, heard the prayer, and, with an earthquake that shook the hills, appeared with seventy-one brothers and a sister, S\u00e1yari. Called on to give up the holy men, Punvar refused and by the help of the gods and a magic amulet suffered nothing from the arrows of Yaksh's brothers. Then S\u00e1yari, taking the form of a mosquito, bit Punvar on the arm so that he drew off his amulet, and, in the siege, a stone falling from the roof broke his head. Yaksh cursed the town and it has since lain desolate.\n\nAnother story is that in the eighth century of the Christian era, King Punvar oppressing the Sangh\u00e1rs, they sought the aid of some foreigners from western Asia. Seventy-two horsemen came, and, establishing themselves on a hill three miles from Punvar\u00e1nogad, took the fort and killed the chief. The Sangh\u00e1rs named this hill Kakad-gad in honour of the strange leader Kakad, and, out of respect for the saviours, called them Yaksh\u00e1s after the fair-skinned horse-riding\n\n---\n\n1 Prinsep, Jour. As. Soc. Beng. IV. 687.\n2 Sir A. Burnes' MS. 1828.\n3 Punvar is like most Cutch antiquities closely connected with L\u00e1kha Phul\u00e1ni the Rustam and Arthur of the province.\n4 Several of the hills near get their names from their quaking before Yaksh and his brethren; Nan\u00e1o the shaker; Dhrabvo, the shaker; L\u00e1kh\u00e1diyo, unstable as water; and Addho Chini, the cliff. Another hill was called K\u00e1kadbit after the youngest of the seventy-two brothers.\n5 Sir A. Burnes' MS. 1828.\nIn their honour the Sangh\u00e1rs made images of the seventy-two horsemen, set them on a railed platform on Punvar\u00e1nogad, with their faces towards the south, and instituted a fair on the second Monday of Bh\u00e1drapad (September-October). This fair lasting two days is attended by about 16,000 pilgrims, mostly Cutch Hindus. Except the Sangh\u00e1rs, who are staunch devotees of the Yaksh\u00e1s and believe in no other gods, most of the pilgrims attend either for trade or pleasure. The trade, in rice, sugar, oil, almonds, cardamoms, pulses, cocoanuts, groceries, cloth, wood, bullocks, horses, camels, goats, sheep, cows, buffaloes, and other articles, is valued at from \u00a35000 to \u00a37500 (Rs. 50,000 - 75,000).\n\nThe large palace, upper storied and surrounding an open quadrangle, about fifty-five feet square and twenty high, tastefully built of very large blocks of stone, stands on the north side of the city. The front porch and colonnade are ornamented with carving. The upper story and the very heavy stone terraced roof are each supported by eighty-four pillars, each pillar one block of stone, round, and with capitals carved into figures of men and animals. The small, or half-day palace, addho t\u00e1r\u00f3, for it was only twelve hours building, one storied, of stone, and with rather poor carving, is forty feet long by thirty-three broad. There are two rooms in the back with two verandahs. The roof is a flat terrace of massive stone slabs, joined with dove-tails of iron and plastered with cement 1\u00bd inches thick. It seems to have stood in a garden watered by a well now filled with earth and stones and overgrown with trees.\n\nIn the centre of a platform, 7 feet 9 inches high 160 feet long and 41 wide, stands a temple of Mah\u00e1dev, 50 feet 9 inches long and 22 feet 3 inches wide. In each corner of the platform is a small ruined shrine. Between the ruined entrance and the porch is a hollow for sacrificial fire, agnikund. The temple, facing the west, of blocks of grey and black iron sandstone put together without cement, must have stood about fifty feet high. The porch, 26\u00bd feet long and 18 wide, has 16 pilasters and 8 square, 12 feet high, pillars forming two aisles. In the brackets are figures of men and lions. The dome has fallen, but an upper floor, with rosettes in the middle of the ceiling and a cornice of creeping plants cut in the stone, is entire. Above the lintel are large figures of musicians. The upper part of the shrine has fallen and been rebuilt. Near the temple are some tombstones apparently of later date, but without any writing.\n\nAccording to both Br\u00e1hman and Buddhist writings the Yaksh\u00e1s are a class of superhuman beings, white, handsome, and mounted on horseback. Mentioned in the Veds, they are generally supposed to have been a Himalayan tribe with whom the Aryans had dealings, during, or soon after, their entry into India. Who the Cutch Yaksh\u00e1s were is doubtful. Fair horsemen from the west, the fact that their traces remain only on the coast would seem to show that they came by sea. This excludes from the number of possible Yaksh\u00e1s, the Greeks (325 B.C.), the Yuetchi or Indo-Skythians (100 B.C.-100 A.D.), and the White Huns (500 A.D.). There remain the Romans of the first, the Persians of the sixth, and the Arabs of the eighth centuries. The Romans may be rejected. Their invasion is doubtful and they could hardly have brought horses. Arabs too seem unlikely. They would strike the Cutch people as ruddy not as white, and, by their conquest of Sind and their attacks on western India, the Arabs were too well known to become centres of legend. It therefore seems probable that these Yaksh\u00e1s were the Persians who, at that time the chief seafaring nation in the Indian seas, in the sixth century, conquered the lower Indus, but did not settle withdrawing as soon as the local ruler agreed to pay tribute. See Reinaud's Memoir Sur. l'Inde, 125-127.\nAt some distance west of the fort are two ruined Mah\u00e1dev temples. They are said to have been built by Dheds or Meghv\u00e1ls, but the richness of the sculpture and the size and style of the materials make this doubtful. One of them, of the same stone as the 'half-day palace,' stands on a platform 70 feet long 50 wide and 15 high, built of large blocks ornamented with bands of carving and with a ruined shrine at each corner. In front of the central shrine were two domed porches, one of which is still standing. In this porch, ten feet high pillars support a dome of excellent workmanship with, under its centre, a sacred fire hollow, agnikund. The shrine, with a richly carved doorway, is ten feet square. The other temple, smaller and standing on a platform twenty feet broad, is all in ruins. Of the mint the only trace is a low stone wall enclosing a space of 120 by 80 feet. Inside of the enclosure is a small building apparently once a temple.\n\nMa'ndvi, or the mart, also called Maska M\u00e1ndvi from a village close by, and in old times known as R\u00e1ipur or Riy\u00e1n, in north latitude 22\u00b0 49' and east longitude 69\u00b0 20', a port of much trade and a population of about 35,000 souls, lies on the right bank of the Bukhi creek about a quarter of a mile from the sea, 500 miles north-east of Bombay, and thirty-five south-east of Bhuj. Along the coast the land is constantly changing, the wind raising the loose sands into shifting dunes, and the sea in one place eating away the land in pools and lagoons, and in another throwing it back in sand banks. Inland the country is lowlying and bare with waving sand hills, and close to the town are large stretches of rich green fields well tilled and watered. Outside of the strong handsome town walls are two suburbs, the trading quarter or New Saraya, stretching to the shore on the west of the Bukhi, and the Old Saraya or seafaring quarter on tolerably high ground on the river's eastern bank. Square in form the town is surrounded by a strong well built wall about twenty-six feet high, three to four broad, and 2740 yards round. It is strengthened by twenty-five bastions, varying in height from thirty-four to forty-four feet, the largest of them at the south-west serving as a light-house. There are three gates and two wickets. The walls suffered much from the 1819 earthquake, and, though repaired, are still cracked in many places. Outside, on the north, runs a watercourse dry except during the rains, and to the north-east and west, hedges and trees grow close to the wall. To the south-west and along the river bank the ground is open. Inside of the walls the streets are narrow, crooked, and dirty. Many of the houses are well built and roomy, two or three stories high, with terraced roofs and richly carved ornaments. In other parts the dwellings are poor, crowded huts of matting and bamboo. M\u00e1ndvi is well supplied with water from wells, many of them inside the town, and from a large lake to the west. Its cool and even climate is a most healthful change from the dry inland heat.\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Sel. CLIL (New Series), 19.\n2 Sir A. Burnes' MS. 1828.\n3 Col.

But, except in times of flood, the part next the town is dry, sandy, and hard, easily crossed by carts. Though the ordinary channel does not cover more than one-half of the bed of the creek, at spring tides it is deep enough to allow vessels of seventy tons (200 kh\u00e1ndis) to come within 500 yards of the town. Near its mouth the creek narrows to 100 yards, and the entrance is difficult, stopped by a troublesome and shifting bar, except for a few months after a flood. During the fair season, August to May, though square-rigged vessels and steamers have to lie and discharge in the roadstead about two miles from the shore, native craft up to about 107 tons (300 kh\u00e1ndis) enter the creek. During the stormy season the port is entirely closed.\n\nThe question of improving the M\u00e1ndvi harbour for years occupied the attention of the late R\u00e1o. In 1875 plans, drawn up by Mr. Jagann\u00e1th Sad\u00e1shiv who had much experience in building the Kurrahee breakwater, were approved by Mr. Ormiston, chief engineer of the Bombay Port Trust, and sanctioned by the R\u00e1o. The works when finished will be known as the Prince of Wales Breakwater. They consist of a breakwater of concrete blocks, starting from high-water mark at 500 feet to the west of the present custom house, stretching in the direction of 10\u00b0 west of south for 1350 feet, and built with a radius of one and a half miles, the general direction making an angle of 56\u00b0 with the axis of the heaviest seas. At extreme low tide the outer end will be two feet under water. Besides being a breakwater the work will be a landing pier available on either side as the wind blows, and when wanted it will be easy to make slopes or stairs for passengers and for landing or shipping cargo. It is proposed to raise the top of the pier to extreme high-water level. On the east side of the harbour, to guide the river floods straight out to sea, a groin of rubble masonry with concrete foundations will start from high water mark under Old Saraya and stretch 1300 feet to ordinary low water limit. At the inner end of the groin, a clay bank, twenty feet broad at top and with slopes of three to one, carried back to the high ground on the left bank of the river, will prevent the flood waters escaping eastward inside the groin. On the right bank of the river, as a wharf and to guide the waters in times of flood, it is proposed to build from the landing-place gate 2500 feet seaward, a rubble masonry wall filling in behind the wall a belt of land on an average about 150 feet broad. It is also proposed to extend the wharf 700 feet towards the sea, so that, at ordinary low tides, the end will lie in the water and a shipping basin be formed between the pier and the breakwater. This scheme is estimated to cost nearly \u00a380,000. If necessary, at an additional outlay of \u00a360,000 the breakwater can be carried 2170 feet further.\n\nPopulation.\n\nOf the population of M\u00e1ndvi the most important classes are the traders and seamen. The traders, chiefly Bh\u00e1ti\u00e1s and V\u00e1ni\u00e1s, are prosperous and well-to-do, many of them having made fortunes in\n\n---\n\n1 Col.

The pilots, many of whom are Rajputs, are famous for their skill and daring. Many of them have quadrants and can tell the latitude by sun and polestar, and the longitude by dead reckoning.\n\nM\u00e1ndvi, or R\u00e9ipur as it is still properly called, is a very old place of trade. Of the history of the old town, about two miles to the north of the present site, nothing has been traced. The story told of it, that, on account of the stinginess of its people to some powerful devotee it was overthrown and covered with earth and ashes, is told of many other old Gujar\u00e1t cities. The present city dates from the close of the sixteenth century (1581, S.1638). It was, with the help of a Bh\u00e1tia named Topan, established by R\u00e1o Kheng\u00e1riji, the founder of Bhuj and the first J\u00e1deja ruler of the whole of Cutch. Though at times greatly harassed by pirates, M\u00e1ndvi would seem to have soon become a place of considerable trade. Towards the close of the eighteenth century R\u00e1o Godji (1760-1778), a great patron of traders and seamen, did much for the town, making a palace and a dockyard, and personally superintending the building of ships. One, built in the M\u00e1ndvi yard and manned and commanded entirely by Cutchmen, sailed safely to England and back to the Malab\u00e1r coast. At that time (1780), there is said to have been a fleet of not less than 400 vessels, chiefly the property of rich M\u00e1ndvi merchants.\n\nAfter the first unsuccessful attempt to seize R\u00e1o R\u00e1yadhan (1784), M\u00e1ndvi, under R\u00e1mji Khav\u00e1s, threw off its allegiance to the central authority. Two years later R\u00e1mji Khav\u00e1s was, on paying tribute, allowed to keep the town. Again refusing to pay tribute, the town was, by the merchants, made over to Fateh Muhammad. Soon after it passed to his rival Hansr\u00e1j, who, in 1809, entered into an engagement with the British providing, among other terms, that an English agent with a guard of forty men should be stationed at M\u00e1ndvi. Immediately after, in 1809, Hansr\u00e1j died, and the agreement was never carried out. He was succeeded by his brother Tokarsi, who successfully resisted an attack by Fateh Muhammad.\n\nIn 1813 M\u00e1ndvi, or as it is written Madi, is described as large and strongly fortified, the houses indifferent chiefly of mats and bamboos. It had a considerable commerce with the British settlement of Bombay, many of whose merchants had agents at M\u00e1ndvi. There was some trade with the Persian Gulf. Its chief export was a rather low class cotton. During the following years M\u00e1ndvi would seem to have greatly advanced. Captain MacMurdo describes it, in 1818, as having 50,000 inhabitants, and a considerable inland trade with M\u00e1rv\u00e1r and M\u00e1lwa. In spite of the bar, over which no laden boat of more than 35 tons (100 kh\u00e1ndis) could pass, it had a brisk sea trade with Arabia, Bombay, and the Malab\u00e1r coast, employing upwards of 800 boats of from 14 to 178 tons (40 - 500\n\n---\n\n1 Taylor's Sailing Directory, Part I., 342.\n2 Tod's Western India, 452.\n3 Milburn's Oriental Commerce, I. 149.\nkh\u00e1ndis), and in port and town dues yielded a yearly revenue of about \u00a325,000 (Rs. 2,50,000). The chief exports were cotton and cotton silk, mashru, cloth, coarse piece-goods, alum, and butter. The imports were, from Daman and Malab\u00e1r, dates, cocoanuts, grain, and timber; from Mocha, bullion; and from the African coast, ivory, and rhinoceros horn and hides. In 1823, when visited by Tod, M\u00e1ndvi was sharing in the 'universal stagnation of commercial enterprise,' and was suffering specially from the stoppage of the slave trade. Still there were (January 3rd) in the creek and roadstead two or three hundred vessels, one of them three-masted belonging to the R\u00e1o. Among them were the African and Arabian traders. About twenty of the African fleet averaging 214 tons burden (600 kh\u00e1ndis) provided with cannon, since the overthrow by the British of the Jo\u00e1smi pirates of the Arabian coast, used only for salutes, were manned by merry, nimble, and well knit Sidi sailors. The Arab trading craft, 'probably unchanged since the days of Hair\u00e1m (1000 B.C.),' with enormous stretches of canvas hung on yards large enough for the main sail of a first rate East Indiaman, were dark in colour, their stems hung with hundreds of earthen jars, the sailors' ventures. The chief exports were cotton 'in round well pressed bales,' coarse cotton cloth, sugar, oil, and butter. The chief imports were, from the Malab\u00e1r coast, lead, green grass, copper, cardamoms, pepper, ginger, bamboos, teakwood, musk kasturi, ochres, dyes, and drugs. From the Persian and Arab coasts, areca-nut, rice, cocoanut, dates dry and fresh, silks, and spices, and from Africa rhinoceros hides and ivory. The port dues were said to yield a yearly revenue of about \u00a310,000, and a house-tax a further sum of \u00a32500. Upwards of fifty bankers paid a yearly tax of \u00a310, the richest being Gos\u00e1is, who, joining trade with religion, had branch houses at P\u00e1li and Benares.\n\nIn 1827. Four years later (1827, February 18th), Sir A. Burnes found the M\u00e1ndvi river very small, the bed about 400 yards wide, but more than half on the west side dry except in the rainy season, the channel on the east deep enough at spring tides to let vessels or rather boats of very heavy burden come within 500 yards of the town, the creek narrowing to about 100 yards and deepening till, at high springs, it was twenty feet near the mouth. Outside was a daily increasing sand bank, that seemed as if artificial means would be wanted to clear it out. Large vessels lay about three miles off shore where was good anchorage. Boats lay anywhere from the customs house downwards. There were 214 boats carrying on an extensive\n\n---\n\n1 M\u00e1ndvi is said, and I think it very probable, to contain 50,000 inhabitants upwards of 15,000 of them Bh\u00e1ti\u00e1s, 10,000 V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, 5000 Brahmans, and the rest Loh\u00e1n\u00e1s, Muhammadians, and low castes.

The chief exports were cotton and butter. The imports were, from the K\u00e1thi\u00e1war coast, firewood and grass; from Sind, rice and saltpetre; from Bombay, sugar and Europe and China goods; from Malab\u00e1r, wood, pepper, and rice; and from Arabia, sulphur, dates, and honey. The whole revenue was estimated at \u00a323,087 (8,75,000 koris). The population was returned at 50,000 souls and the houses at 20,000. But, in Sir A. Burnes' opinion, there were not more than 10,000 houses and 30,000 people. Of the inhabitants two-thirds were Hindus, the V\u00e1ni\u00e1s so powerful that they prevented the Musalm\u00e1ns eating animal food, and stopped fishing within a circuit of six miles. Even the chief streets were narrow, and beyond imagination filthy. Except the palace there was no house of any consequence. The people complained that trade was dull. But Sir A. Burnes doubted the justice of the complaint; the town was very busy, and there were a number of new boats building.\n\nIn 1837 (January), the streets were narrow, dirty, and ill-ordered, but many of the houses were commodious, some two or three stories high with terraced roofs and richly carved ornaments. The people, chiefly V\u00e1ni\u00e1s, Br\u00e1hmans, and husbandmen, seemed hardworking and cheerful, noticeably busy, well-to-do, and fairly dressed. Very tastefully and fancifully worked cotton cloth was the chief manufacture, and there were many boats making and mending. The sea trade was important. Cotton cloth was the chief export, and the chief imports, dates, coffee, dried grapes, antimony, senna, and coloured mats from Arabia, and ivory and rhinoceros horn from the African coast. The seamen were Cutch pilots and Arab sailors.\n\nThree years later (1840) the creek was much obstructed with sandbanks, which, except in seasons of a heavy rainfall, left only a small passage for boats of moderate burden. There was good anchorage half a mile from the shore. M\u00e1ndvi was very rich and busy, with a land trade to P\u00e1li and other places in Sind, Jesalmer, M\u00e1rv\u00e1r, and Gujar\u00e1t, and a sea trade to the Malab\u00e1r coast, the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, and the African coast sometimes as far as Mozambique. The average yearly revenue from its sea and land customs was about \u00a325,000 (Rs. 2,50,000). About twenty boats sailed every year to Africa. Except two of 285 tons (800 kh\u00e1nd\u00eds), they varied in size from 53 to 92 tons (150-260 kh\u00e1nd\u00eds). A few were Arab boats with Arab crews, but most were Cutch boats with Cutch crews, some Musalm\u00e1ns but most Rajputs. The trading season opened in the beginning of October and closed towards the end of May, when the boats came back from Zanzibar. The vessels engaged in this trade, many of them very large and well made, decked, and carrying four carronades, were known as the Suval\u00ed.\n\n---\n\n1 Sir A. Burnes' MS. 1827.\n2 Mrs. Postans' Cutch, 9-16.\n3 Sometimes a Suval\u00ed ship sails to reach Mandvi before the stormy season sets in. In such cases they stop at Chanka on the K\u00e1thi\u00e1war coast and, unloading there, send the cargo in small boats to M\u00e1ndvi. Lightened of its cargo the large vessel waits for a spring tide and then runs into the M\u00e1ndvi creek.

The exports were cotton cloth, cotton, and brass in wire and rods. Cloth was the chief article, the leading varieties being pankoras, unbleached cotton cloth from M\u00e1rw\u00e1r; kanik\u00e1, a coarse M\u00e1rw\u00e1r cloth dyed black in M\u00e1ndvi; bar\u00f3ni, a M\u00e1ndvi made sail cloth; and \u2018the grand article of export\u2019 sia kapda, black cloth made at M\u00e1ndvi from English thread and dyed with indigo. Of cotton there were about 150 bags chiefly from the coast, k\u00e1nthi, district of Cutch and K\u00e1thi\u00e1war, and about 300 mans of brass rods, a very inferior article, were yearly exported. Though traders complained that American and French competition made it hard to get, the yearly imports of ivory were 160 tons (450 kh\u00e1ndis), worth at M\u00e1ndvi about \u00a359,366 (4000 to 5000 koris a kh\u00e1ndi). In Africa ivory was received in barter for cloth, and at M\u00e1ndvi, except a little worked into women\u2019s ornaments, it was, in return for grain and coarse cloth, taken by Ch\u00e1rans on bullock back to M\u00e1rw\u00e1r. The other articles were, a very clear gum called chandros used in dyeing and varnishing; small quantities of rhinoceros hides and horns, the hides made into shields, the horns into snuff boxes and knife and sword handles; about 100,000 cocoanuts; forty bags of betel nuts; sometimes millet, pulse, and oil-seeds; and always some gold in dust, or ingots, dollars or venetians.\n\nIn 1855 M\u00e1ndvi is described as a large town of from 8000 to 9000 houses. In 1861 the population was estimated at 40,000 souls. A brisk trade with Arabia and Malab\u00e1r was carried on by country vessels of from 14 to 178 tons (40-500 kh\u00e1ndis). There were large stores of timber and much shipbuilding, two vessels, \u2018unique specimens of art,\u2019 having been lately launched. In 1873 the creek was said to be less serviceable than formerly. The anchorage for vessels of any size was on eighteen to thirty feet from 1\u00bd to 2\u00bd miles south of the port, and boats drawing more than nine feet could seldom, even at the best time when rains had cleared away the bar, pass up the creek. With the west winds after February the bar became troublesome, till in May a boat drawing seven or eight feet had to bump over it to get into the creek. At the close of the season (May - June) vessels running in carelessly took the ground and bumped till the tide ran out, and they could be in part discharged. In this way a dozen boats were often destroyed, and as many more had to undergo a thorough repair.\n\nIn 1872, a dispute between the V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s and the Musalm\u00e1n Bohor\u00e1s had so bad an effect on the trade of the port that the customs receipts fell off by more than \u00a310,000. In 1873 matters were\n\n---\n\n1 There were 20 sorts of black cloth distinguished chiefly by the number of threads in the warp.

The fleet of M\u00e1ndvi boats numbered 244 ranging from 17 to 178 tons (50 - 500 kh\u00e1ndis). In 1875 the number of vessels is returned at 236 of a total burden of 13,719 tons (40,350 kh\u00e1ndis). During the year twenty-seven had been built. There were 1358 arrivals and 1920 departures. The exports were cotton, wool, alum, butter, garlic, and black cloth; the imports, worth about four times as much as the exports, were grain, groceries, oilman\u2019s stores, cloth, paper, ivory, iron, and brass and copper wares. Besides the local coasting trade M\u00e1ndvi had trade connections with Kurrahee, Bombay, the Malab\u00e1r coast, and Calcutta, and out of India with the Persian Gulf, Aden, and Zanzibar. The customs dues had fallen from \u00a320,749 (Rs. 2,07,490) in 1874 to \u00a318,700 (Rs. 1,87,000) in 1875. In the next year they again rose, and in 1878, though slightly lower than in the year before, were at \u00a320,864 (Rs. 2,08,640). The number of vessels was 260, twenty-one of them new.\u00b9 The chief change in the trade of late years has been the competition of steamers. Steamers have occasionally for many years visited the gulf of Cutch. But it was only in 1872-73 that M\u00e1ndvi became a place of call for a regular line. During the past season (October 1878 - May 1879), vessels of the British India line called weekly at M\u00e1ndvi, and besides the port was from time to time visited by small coasting steamers. The steamer traffic is almost entirely in passengers.\n\nOf objects of interest there is in the town itself, about 100 yards to the east of the light-house, in a densely peopled part of the town, a large flat-roofed three-storied mansion built by R\u00e1o Lakhpat (1741 - 1760) as a palace, and now, by the kindness of His Highness the R\u00e1o, set apart as a rest-house for British officers. In style it is extremely plain. Built of white stone in European fashion, it is adorned with much rich carving of dancing girls, tigers, and roystering Dutch knaves, each holding a bottle and glass.\u00b2\n\nOn the south-west bastion of the fort is a light-house, showing a small fixed light, of the fourth order, at eighty-three feet above high-water level, visible in all weathers at a distance of from nine to ten miles.\u00b3\n\nOf religious buildings there is the Vaishnav temple of Sundarvar, built by R\u00e1o Kheng\u00e1rji when he founded the town in 1574 (S. 1631). The plinth is covered about four deep with earth and mud. Facing the west, the temple, built of sandstone, thirty-five feet high and with two belts of carving round the wall, is entered by a domed hall, sabh\u00e1mandap, with domed porches on three sides, and triangular projections on the square of the hall, mandap, on which is a dome sixteen feet in diameter, supported by eight pillars, partly\n\n\u00b9 Bom.

Within the hall is an oblong space in whose screen walls are niches with holy water, charn\u00e1mr\u00edt. The shrine measures ten feet by eleven. On a stone stand, kamal\u00e1san, a wooden frame, lined and covered with silk, contains a richly dressed black basalt image of Sundarvarji.\n\nIn style like the temple of Sundarvar, but larger and more richly carved is R\u00e1neshvar\u2019s temple, a stone building fifty-seven feet by forty-eight, restored to its present form after the 1819 earthquake by Seth Sundarji Shivji. It would seem to have been built early in the seventeenth century 1627 (S. 1684), according to the local story, by K\u00e1m\u00e1b\u00e1i sister of R\u00e1o Bh\u00e1rmalji (1585-1631). A small image of V\u00e1gheshvar, placed by that lady in the temple, shows signs of the rough usage it met with at the hands of the Musalm\u00e1n R\u00e1o R\u00e1yadhan (1778-1813). The temple of Lakshmi-n\u00e1rayan, like but richer than that of Sundarvar, was built by Seth Topan, the founder of the town, about 1607 (S. 1664). The Haveli of Ranchhodji Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j, a Vaishnav temple of the Vallabh\u00e1ch\u00e1rya sect, is a two-storied tiled house built round an open court like the dwellings of M\u00e1ndvi traders. It is much resorted to by Bh\u00e1ti\u00e1s who go there to worship several times a day.\n\nOf Musalm\u00e1n places of worship there are two plain mosques, the K\u00e1jivali Masjid built in 1608 (S. 1665), and the J\u00e1ma Masjid built in 1603 (S. 1660). The J\u00e1ma Masjid is said to show signs of having once been a Hindu temple. The domes were thrown down by the earthquake of 1819. In their place a tiled roof has since been built. On the coast, west of M\u00e1ndvi, each on the crest of a sand hill, about 100 feet high and useful as land-marks to seamen, are two buildings, Pir Tam\u00e1sa, a Musalm\u00e1n tomb, about three, and Assar M\u00e1ta, a Hindu temple, about seven miles from Mandvi.\n\nMorgad, about eighteen miles south-west of Bhuj, a place of great antiquity, is said to have been founded by Ahipat the son of S\u00e1mantsinha Ch\u00e1vda, who, after the expulsion of the Ch\u00e1vd\u00e1s from P\u00e1tan about 942, established himself in Cutch, and, conquering about 900 villages, made Morgad his capital. Of this no trace remains, except perhaps in the name of the Ch\u00e1vadko lake.\n\nMundra, in north latitude 22\u00b0 50' and east longitude 69\u00b0 45', a port town, with, in 1872, a population of 7952 souls, stands on the gulf of Cutch about twenty-nine miles south-east of Bhuj, half way between M\u00e1ndvi on the west and Anj\u00e1r on the east. Surrounded by well watered gardens, and cut off from its landing place by about a mile and a half of muddy swamp, Mundra is walled and fortified with twenty unserviceable guns. Great part of the masonry of the town comes from the ruins of Bhadresar, twelve miles to the north-east. Fortified in 1728 by Devkarn Seth, Mundra was in 1755 held and defended by Godji when in revolt from his father. In 1801 it was given by Fateh Muhammed to Dosal Ven, and in 1815, when held by Muhammad\n\n---\n\n1 Charn\u00e1mr\u00edt, literally feet nectar, that is water in which the feet of saints have been washed.

In 1818 it is said to have had a population of 1200 souls and to have yielded a revenue of \u00a33000 (Rs. 30,000). In 1855 it was in good repair and contained 1500 houses. In 1861 it was noted for petty carpets of stamped cotton. Except for small country craft the channel was very difficult and was passable only at high tide. There is (1879) a considerable trade with K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, C\u00e1bay, Surat, and Bombay, the chief exports being cotton, castor seed, pulse, wool, and dyed cloth; and the chief imports, metals, timber, grain, dates, grocery, and piece goods. The merchants are well-to-do, some of them retired and others still in business. At present the port has few conveniences. The creek called the Bukhi is so filled with silt that vessels of more than 100 tons burden cannot come near the landing place. It is proposed to open a road to Navin\u00e1l a deep open creek, about seven miles west of Mundra. Among objects of interest are a very large and handsome two-storied rest-house built by a Khoja of Bhadresar, and a canopy, chhatra, raised over the footprints, p\u00e1duka, of a Jain high priest of the Anchal order, 13\u00bd feet square inside, with a small spire over the marble slab on which the footprints are engraved. The inside of the dome is neatly carved with a row of standing musicians. The outside of the dome is modern, but the screen wall, pillars, and interior are all old in thirteenth or fourteenth century style. As the inscription round the footprints is dated 1744, this tomb is probably the hall, mandap, of an old temple. The front of the spire, shikhar, over the marble slab bears the footprints of the Guru Hanss\u00e1g\u00e1r, the disciple of the Guru Jiv\u00e1j\u00ed, who went to the gods in M\u00e1gas\u00edrsha vad 10th S. 1797 (1740 A.D.). Near this tomb is a memorial stone, p\u00e1lia, apparently, from the figure of a ship carved on it, raised to some seafarer. At B\u00e1r\u00e1i about a mile from Mundra, enclosed in a small court, is a temple of Nilkanth Mah\u00e1dev, or the blue-necked Shiv, with, at the right side of the shrine door, an inscription dated 1667 (S. 1724). The l\u00edng is overshadowed by a large seven-headed brass snake. It is said to have been brought from the temple of Duda at Bhadresar.\n\nNaliya, in Abd\u00e1s\u00e1, north latitude 23\u00b0 13' and east longitude 68\u00b0 51', four miles from T\u00e9ra, with a population of 5238 souls, is one of the most thriving towns in west Cutch.

It stands on a raised plot of sandstone rock separated from the mainland by tidal swamps which are covered at high water. The temples, the chief buildings in the place, are surrounded by a fortified wall, outside of which cluster the villagers' houses. It is connected with the mainland by a rather ruinous yellow stone causeway, about 3000 feet long and fifteen wide, built in 1863 by a Bombay Bh\u00e1tia named Gokald\u00e1s Lil\u00e1dh\u00e1r P\u00e1dsha, at a cost of about \u00a32500 (1,00,000 koris).\n\nN\u00e1r\u00e1yansar, with Koteshvar the only places in Cutch visited by pilgrims from other parts of India, was in very ancient times famous for its great lake. This, agreeing with the account of the lake found by Alexander, and perhaps lasting till the change of the course of the Indus (about 1000), was in part renewed by the earthquake of 1819. Beside the lake, there was, from early times, a temple of \u00c1din\u00e1r\u00e1y\u00e1n in the village of N\u00e1r\u00e1yansar. For long under priests of the K\u00e1mphata sect, the temple was, about 1550 (S. 1607), wrested from them by a Sany\u00e1s\u00ed or \u00c1tit named N\u00e1rangar from Jun\u00e1gad. This N\u00e1rangar made long and broad embankments about the pool, an oblong sheet of water, 1056 feet by 990, divided by perforated stone walls into a number of bathing places, and furnished on all sides except the east with flights of stone steps, and surrounded by rest-houses. In a paved courtyard 164 feet by 62\u00bd, approached from the lake by flights of stone steps, and surrounded by a strong wall are seven stone temples. V\u00e1gheli Mah\u00e1kunvar the wife of R\u00e1c Desalji (1718-1741), displeased with the Dw\u00e1rka priests, after taking counsel with her Br\u00e1hm\u00e1ns, determined to raise N\u00e1r\u00e1yansar to be a place of rival sanctity. Accordingly, in 1734, she first built the temples of Lakshmin\u00e1r\u00e1y\u00e1n and Trikamr\u00e1y in the same style as the Dw\u00e1rka temples, assigning them the revenues of certain villages and the proceeds of certain taxes, and then those of \u00c1din\u00e1r\u00e1y\u00e1n, Govardhann\u00e1th, Dv\u00e1rkan\u00e1th, and Lakshmiji. The temple of Trikamr\u00e1y, in style and shape resembling that at Koteshvar, 72 feet long 68\u00bd broad and 61 high, stands on a 5 feet 9 inches high platform, and has three side porches with a large one in the centre, all capped with domes resting on twelve feet high pillars. The central porch is 21 feet square, and each of the side porches 9 feet 9 inches. The 1819 earthquake threw down the central dome, but it has since been rebuilt. The space between the central dome and the shrine is paved with white and black marble. In the east screen wall of the shrine is a marble plate with an inscription. The doors are plated with silver. In the shrine, on a silver throne, stands a black marble image of Trikamr\u00e1y. Under the idol throne is a black marble figure of Vishnu's eagle, garud, with clasped hands kneeling on one leg. Over the image of Trikamr\u00e1y are forty gold and silver parasols, the offerings of devotees.\n\nThe other five temples built by V\u00e1gheli Mah\u00e1kunvar form, along with the more lately built temple of K\u00e1ly\u00e1nr\u00e1y, a row of six domes supported by fourteen pillars, and forty-eight pilasters, with carving on the bases, shafts, and capitals. The brackets are scrolled volutes\n\n---\n\n1 Thornton; Colonel Barton's Tour in Cutch (February 1878), 16; Bom. Gov. Sel. CLII.

The temples at the two ends have screen walls under their domes with doors, but the rest have a common verandah with entrances in the front, the space on the two sides of each entrance being closed with a screen of wooden lattice. Each of the temples has an inscription. Lakshmi's is without any special feature. Dvarkanatha's or Ranchhodji's has a small shrine opposite to it with a large image of Vishnu's vulture, holding a weapon whose point impales a cobra. The third shrine, to Govardhanath, has nothing calling for remark. The fourth, to Adinarayan, has a black stone pavement in the gallery. Opposite it is a small lately built shrine of Gopali. The last, to Lakshminarayan, has silver-plated doors and an idol throne and canopy of silver. In a line with these five temples is the temple of Kalyanaray built in 1828 (S. 1885) by Rao Desalji II. The stone and wood frames of the entrance are richly carved, and the doors are plated with silver in which flowers, fruit, leaves, and creepers are carved with much skill.

Besides these built temples the soft sandstone near the fort has at various times been hollowed into shrines and caves. They are known as the Ramgupha, Lakshman-gupha, and Sheshgupha caves. From the brittleness of the rock they are of no great size.\u00b9 Two yearly fairs are held here, one in Chaitra, (April-May) when about 1000 people assemble; the other from the 10th to the 15th of K\u00e1rtik (November-December), when, from Cutch, Sind, Gujar\u00e1t, K\u00e1thi\u00e1war, Punj\u00e1b, M\u00e1rw\u00e1r, and Central India, about 5000 pilgrims come to perform funeral ceremonies on the bank of the N\u00e1r\u00e1yan lake. The income and expenditure is under the control of a Brahmach\u00e1ri, appointed by the state. The total income arising from the funeral and thread ceremonies and from fees paid for shaving, bathing, touching the feet of the idols, and throwing the bones of the dead into the lake, amounts to about \u00a3263 (10,000 koris). The value of the cloth, pots, groceries, and other articles brought for sale was, in 1877, estimated at about \u00a34000 (1,50,000 koris). Payment is sometimes made in cash and sometimes in kind.

It was formerly a seaport and a place of great trade. Of its destruction the common story is that the ascetic Dhoramn\u00e1th, the founder of the sect of K\u00e1nphat\u00e1s, finding the people of the town most wanting in charity, cursed it and it was destroyed.\u2074 In the ruins some of the ass money and some Indo-Sassanian coins have been found.\u2075 In the court-yard of a turretted square is a temple, forty-five feet wide and twenty-five high, with domes in Muhammadan style dedicated to Dhoramn\u00e1th, and built by R\u00e1o Bh\u00e1rmalji in 1609 (S. 1666).\u2076\n\n\u00b9 Colonel Barton's Tour in Cutch (Feb. 1878), 17; Bom.

The throne in the temple of Dhoram-\nRa Kanoj, about eight miles north of Gunthli, on the north bank of the Kinnar, stretches in ruined heaps for about a mile. Among the ruins are indistinct traces of an old fort and of the line of the city walls. The town would seem to have been destroyed by Musalm\u00e1ns, but of its date nothing is known. About five miles south-west of Ra Kanoj is the tomb of K\u00e1sim, who, according to the local story, took and destroyed the city. K\u00e1sim is said to have sent, as a prize to his sovereign the king of Ghazni, two of the chief's daughters. At Ghazni they were treated with every kindness, but refused to be comforted, saying, that while they were under his charge, K\u00e1sim had violated them. Enraged at the story the king, without inquiry, ordered K\u00e1sim to be put to death and his head sent to Ghazni. When it was shown them, his accusers rejoiced that they had avenged their father's death, and confessed that K\u00e1sim had done them no harm. On account of his undeserved punishment K\u00e1sim became a saint. The place was not of any note till, in the beginning of the present century, Fateh Muhammad started the practice of visiting it every year with much state. So greatly in their opinion do they gain from being buried near this tomb, that the Jats bring their dead from great distances, and the country for two miles round is one great graveyard. K\u00e1sim's tomb, thirty-five feet long and five broad, is made of stones piled up without cement. It is on the site of a Shaiv temple, and the ling once broken has been cemented, and is now worshipped both by Hindus and Musalm\u00e1ns as K\u00e1sameshvar. The temple pool, kund, also remains.

In the shrine, smeared with red paint and butter and with five other images at her side, is a large statue of Ravechi M\u00e1ta and opposite it Naklank or the Horse incarnation standing on three legs on a pillar. The goddess is highly venerated by the people of V\u00e1gad. Out of the temple income about 500 cows are maintained, and travellers are fed daily with milk, curds, and bread. The old temple, a range of finely carved nine-domed shrines with porches built by the P\u00e1ndavs, is said to have been destroyed by the troops of one of the B\u00e1bi chiefs.

From V\u00e1v\u00e1nya on the south coast of the gulf, the passage of thirty miles is generally made in two tides. As there are seldom more than four feet of water, only small craft can pass. It is through the network of creeks that surround the Sathsaida island that the trade of Rohar finds an outlet. The boats cross the inner gulf principally to V\u00e1v\u00e1nya, and also do a small coasting trade in the outer gulf. In 1818 the port was able to hold vessels of about 70 tons (200 kh\u00e1ndis), and had a hard sandy beach over which carts could pass close to the sea. A small fort, falling into decay, was still useful against Miy\u00e1ni robbers. Water had been scarce, but the supply had lately been improved by building a new reservoir.\u00b9\n\nSa'ndha'n, on the coast about thirty miles west of M\u00e1nvdi, seems to be the Sindan\u00b2 which, about 820, a certain Fazl, son of M\u00e1h\u00e1n, formerly a slave of the house of Samma, took, and, building a J\u00e1ma mosque, had the prayers read in Khaliph Mamun's (813-833) name. Fazl was succeeded by his son Muhammad, whose place, when he was absent on an expedition against the Meds of Hind, was treacherously usurped by his brother M\u00e1h\u00e1n. To win the goodwill of the Kaliph M\u00fatasim-bi-ll\u00e1h (838-841), M\u00e1h\u00e1n sent the largest and longest teak tree that had ever been seen.\u00b3 But the people of S\u00e1ndh\u00e1n, preferring his brother, slew M\u00e1h\u00e1n and crucified him. Shortly after, they declared themselves independent, but spared the mosque which the Muhammadans continued to use every Friday.\u2074 In 912 S\u00e1ndh\u00e1n, one of the countries of Sind, is mentioned as a place where the teak tree and canes grow.\u2075 A few years later (943-968), it was said to be a strong and great city with a J\u00e1ma mosque, where Muhammadan precepts were openly observed and where mangoes, cocoanuts, lemons, and rice grew in great abundance.\u2076\n\nShika'rpur, three miles from V\u00e1ndia, a large thriving village with a newly built fort, has the tombs of three Musalm\u00e1n saints Patha, Gebansha Mult\u00e1ni, and As\u00e1ba. Patha, who is said to have come from Sind, earned his fame by changing salt water into fresh; Gebansha by going on fighting after his head was off; and As\u00e1ba by curing the blind. The tombs are plain uninteresting buildings.\u2077\n\nSikra, about twenty-one miles north-east of Bhuj, is said to have once been a large and flourishing town.

(See Elliot, I, 450).\n\u00b3 The word is edj (Elliot, I, 129), said to mean either a sash or a teak tree. The teak tree seems more likely as Sadan is afterwards (912) mentioned as a place where teak trees grew.\n\u2074 Elliot, I, 129, 450.\n\u2075 Ibn Khurd\u00e1ba in Elliot, I, 4 and 15.

The ruins are overgrown with trees. A little to the south of the village, once it is said the heart of the city, is a saint's shrine, and two strong and well built Momna Kanbi tombs built in 1666 (S. 1723). Near the shrine is a handsome Jain temple of solid masonry built in 1716 (S. 1773) and dedicated to V\u0101spuj. The beautiful marble image of V\u0101spuj, when in 1785 (S. 1842) threatened by the Miy\u00e1n\u00e1s, was taken to Adhoi. Near the temple are many memorial stones, one of them bearing as old a date as 1003 (S. 1060).\n\nTahej or Tej is mentioned by Abul Fazl (1582) as the capital of Cutch with two strong forts J\u00e1ra and Kanthkot. Tej is also said at a remote period to have been the metropolis of Saur\u00e1shtra, that is, the whole country from the Indus to Daman. But the passage is doubtful, and there is now no town or ruins that can be identified with the place.\n\nTanva'na, a village about thirty miles south-west of Bhuj, has a six monthly fair in honour of Rukan Sh\u00e1h, a Shir\u00e1z Syed, who, on a pilgrimage to Mecca in the thirteenth century of the Samvat era, at Tanv\u00e1na quarrelled with certain Dal Rajputs, and though his head was cut off, walked on for some distance. The fairs are held on the first Mondays of Chaitra (April-May) and Bh\u00e1drapad (September-October). At the spring fair, when it lasts for two days, the number of pilgrims, most of whom are Cutch Musalm\u00e1ns, averages from 10,000 to 15,000, and at the autumn fair when it lasts for one day, the number averages from 3000 to 4000. Besides the saint's there are in the same enclosure, shaded by banyan and tamarind trees, the tombs of his sister, father, and mother. In the neighbourhood is a pond, much resorted to by the pilgrims, whose water is believed to cure hydrophobia and other diseases, to make the barren fruitful, and to give success in trade. The value of the offerings, mostly goats and sheep, amounts to about \u00a325 (1000 koris). The trade in sugar, butter, rice, sugarcandy, sugarcane, and sweetmeats is valued at about \u00a3800 (30,000 koris). Payment is always made in cash. Fair arrangements, formerly in the hands of the Bakshi of M\u00e1ndvi, are now made by the Cutch police. No outbreaks of epidemic are recorded in connection with this fair.\n\nTeja'ra, three miles south of \u00c1m\u00e1ra, has a pond with sixty-five memorial stones, and the ruins of a Mah\u00e1dev temple on a platform fifteen feet by thirty-six in a courtyard 100 feet by 82. Only six square pillars eight feet long, and part of the back wall and a weather-worn mutilated bull, remain. The stones are yellow without cement and with much carving. The ruins are said to be as\n\n---\n\n1 The writing on the wall of the temple of Vaspujaji at Sikra is: 'this is a Jain temple built in Samvat year 1773, Shake 1638 (1716 A.D.) in the bright half of the month of \u00c1\u015bvina.' Bom. Gov. Sel. CLII. (New Series), 95.\n\n2 The writing on the P\u00e1liya contains five incomplete lines conveying no meaning whatever. The year given is Samvat 1060 (1003 A.D.). Bom. Gov. Sel.

Tej is said to have been founded by King Tej or Tejkarn. There were according to the story, three brothers descended from Ikshvaku, Puru, Buj or Boj, and Tej. The two first are noticed in the Pur\u00e1ns where Puru is called Racha, probably the founder of Purugad, and the other Buj Kacha, the founder of Bhuj.\nold as V\u00e1gham-Ch\u00e1vdagad (1200-1250). According to a local\ncouplet, 63 bushels (3\u00bd kh\u00e1nd\u00eds) of 6d. (1 kori) pieces and 31\nbushels (1\u00bc kh\u00e1nd\u00eds) of 3d.

Even at high springs, boats of fifty tons with\ndifficulty get there up a small winding creek not thirty yards wide.\u00b3\n\nVa'gham Cha'vda'gad or Pa'tgad, five or six miles south-west\nof Lakhpat, has the ruins of the old city of V\u00e1gham Ch\u00e1vda, who\naccording to the ordinary story was, during the thirteenth century,\u2074\nkilled by his nephews Mod and Man\u00e1i. The city seems to have\nstretched over more than two miles chiefly along the banks of the\nstream. The plots of ground known as the custom house, m\u00e1n\u00e1vna\nkhetar, show where some of the offices of the old city stood. The lines\nof the town walls and the site of a dam, that must once have joined a\nlarge lake, may still be traced. There are heaps of ashes, apparently\nthe sites of potter's kilns, and pieces of broken tiles and\nearthenware. Copper coins are sometimes found, but so eaten with\nrust that when handled they crumble into dust. Two temples,\nthough modern, stand on the sites of old buildings, and call for\nnotice. The temple of Kateshvar, re-built in 1824 (S. 1881) by Kshatri\nJetha Sundarji and Mehta Valabhji, is a sandstone shrine 8 feet square\nand 25 high, with a small porch supported by four square pillars.\nInside in the centre is a ling, with an image of Hanum\u00e1n on the right\nand of Ganpati on the left. The temple of K\u00e1lika M\u00e1ta, on the site\nof, but on a smaller scale than, the old temple, was re-built in 1838\n(S. 1895) by a Paramhansa, named Manch\u00e1n\u00e1th. It faces the\nwest, and consists of a shrine and a porch. On the lintel of the\nshrine are nine busts said to represent V\u00e1gham, his son, and the\nseven S\u00e1nds, but more probably intended for the nine planets,\ngrah\u00e1s. In the shrine stands K\u00e1lika, 2\u00bd feet high with four hands\narmed with spears and swords. One spear she thrusts into Mahi-\nsh\u00e1sur's body trampling with one foot on him. In the wall,\nopposite the image and above the entrance, are two stone busts\nfound in the ruins of the old temple, and said to be those of Mod\nand Man\u00e1i, the early Samma settlers in Cutch. An old worn-out\nK\u00e1lika lies by the side of the new image, and outside is another\nlikeness riding on a lion. In front of the porch is a sacrificial\npond, kund, re-built in 1838 (S. 1895) by an Atit named K\u00e1shigar.\nIt is considered holy and the poor people of the neighbouring\nvillages go there to perform the shr\u00e1ddh ceremony and throw the\n\n\u00b9 Bom.

Half a mile to the west of the town, cut in the soft sandstone rock, is a hall thirty-five feet long, and thirty wide, supported on two eight feet high sixteen-sided pillars. On the right is a second room twelve feet square, and there is a third behind.\u00b9\n\n**Varnu.** On the Ran eight miles west of P\u00e1l\u00e1nsva, near Captain MacMurdo\u2019s tomb, is, in a large courtyard, a very old but not very large temple of Varnu with a shrine and three porches with some carving and moulding. The original temple, said to have been built by Mulr\u00e1j of Anhilv\u00e1da (942-997), was repaired in 1862. Inside of the shrine are three red smeared stones, representing Varnu and his brother and sister, according to one account P\u00e1rmar Rajputs, and according to another Jats.\u00b2\n\n**Vinj\u00e1n,** a ruinous dusty town of 400 houses (1877) in a barren treeless country, about fifteen miles from Bet with a population of 1413 souls, is believed to be a place of considerable antiquity. In the time of Gadhising, about two miles to the west of the present site, was the town K\u00e1nchiba Pattan. Its only traces are the ruins of a small shrine of K\u00e1lika M\u00e1ta, a shallow pool, and the remains of a fortress.\u00b3 About the time when Karai Samma came from Sind, and built a palace in Poladiya twelve miles east of K\u00e1nchiba, Vinj\u00e1n passed from Gadhising into the hands of Kanak Dev Ch\u00e1vda. The H\u00e1l\u00e1s, who afterwards took it, removed the town to its present site, near the Vindhya-v\u00e1sini temple, and held it till they were driven out by Jas\u00e1ji, the nephew of R\u00e1o Kheng\u00e1rji. Vindhy\u00e1v\u00e1sini\u2019s temple, lately re-built, is in no way remarkable. Another temple of Raksheshvar Mah\u00e1dev, built according to an inscription in 1631, is of hard yellow stone on a pedestal 5\u00bd feet high 45 long and 35 wide. There are three domed porches with small pyramidal spires ornamented with lions. The entrance porch has four cusped arches. The entrance hall, mandap, 18 feet by 16\u00bd, has a central dome with courses of 8, 16, and 32 sides merging into circles, one projecting over the other, and ending in a central lotus. In the cloisters are two colossal statues of Hanum\u00e1n and K\u00e1lika, the latter in the act of killing Mahish\u00e1sur. The shrine, 6 feet long by 7\u00bd wide and 32 high, has a ling in the centre, and in niches in the opposite wall images of Ganpati and P\u00e1rvati. The whole is well built, and has pretty good carving.\u2074\n\n**Vira,** about forty miles north-east of M\u00e1ndvi, has a temple and reservoir of Jogni Devi, said to be 400 years old (1478 A.D.), but rebuilt in 1853, a favourite place for performing ceremonies for the dead. There is also, about 200 years old, a small stone plastered tomb of a Sind Syed.\u2075 Vira belongs to the descendants of a Jain priest, who, when he was still a fugitive, foretold R\u00e1o Kheng\u00e1rji\u2019s greatness (1587).\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Bom, Gov, Sel, CLII.

Before this goddess the four \u00c1tis, coming from Girn\u00e1r to free the people from the oppression of the K\u00e1np\u00e1th\u00e1s, performed penance, and received orders to take possession of Ajep\u00e1l Koteshvar.\n\u2074 Bom, Gov, Sel, CLII.

Water is scarce and often salt, the soil is generally either rocky or sandy, and the proportion that is cultivated, though very superior to that in K\u00e1thi\u00e1war, is insufficient to support its own scanty population.\n\nThe capital Bhuj contains only 20,000 souls. Lakhpat Bandar, Anj\u00e1r, and perhaps Mundra may have 10,000 inhabitants each. The other towns are generally much smaller. The sea-port of M\u00e1ndvi alone bears the marks of industry and prosperity. It carries on a considerable trade especially with Arabia and the coast of Africa and contains from 30 to 40 thousand inhabitants.\n\nThe whole revenue of this territory is under 50 l\u00e1khs of koris (about 16 l\u00e1khs of Rupees); and of this less than 30 l\u00e1khs of koris belong to the R\u00e1o; the country which yields the remaining 20 l\u00e1khs being assigned to the collateral branches of His Highness' family, each of whom received a certain appanage on the death of the R\u00e1o from whom it is immediately descended. The family of these chiefs is derived at a recent period from Tatta in Sind, and they are all sprung from a common ancestor Hamirji, whose son R\u00e1o Kheng\u00e1r acquired the sovereignty of Cutch, before the middle of the 16th century of our era. The number of these chiefs is at present about 200, and the whole number of their tribe in Cutch is guessed at 10,000 or 12,000 persons. This tribe is called J\u00e1deja; it is a branch of the Rajputs. The other inhabitants of Cutch are computed by the natives at 500,000 souls, of which more than one-third are Muhammadans (mostly converts from the religion of the Br\u00e1hmans) and the rest Hindus, chiefly of the peaceful castes: the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s are all soldiers and the Musalm\u00e1ns supply the rest of the military class.\n\nThe R\u00e1o's ordinary jurisdiction is confined to his own demesne, each J\u00e1deja chief exercising unlimited authority within his own lands. The R\u00e1o can call on the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s to serve him in war, but must furnish them with pay at a fixed rate while they are with his army. He is the guardian of the public peace, and as such chastises all robbers and other general enemies. It would seem that he ought likewise to repress private war and to decide all disputes between chiefs; but this prerogative, though\n\n\u00b9 Dated Chob\u00e1ri, Cutch, 26th January 1821,\n\u00b2 About 150 miles long and sixty broad.\nconstantly exerted, is not admitted without disputes. Each chief has a similar body of kinsmen, who possess shares of the original appanage of the family and stand in the same relation of nominal dependence to him that he bears to the R\u00e1o. These kinsmen form what is called the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d or brotherhood of the chiefs, and the chiefs themselves compose the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d of the R\u00e1o. The annual income of these chiefs varies from a lakh of koris (upwards of Rs. 30,000) to 400 which is little more than Rs. 100. There are not less than fifty whose income exceeds Rs. 5000 a year and who can bring 150 men into the field. The greatest are ambitions of serving at the capital, for which they receive a small pension seldom exceeding Rs. 150 a month. Only thirteen chiefs enjoy this advantage. Besides the J\u00e1d\u00e9j\u00e1s, there are still in Cutch a few chiefs of inferior importance belonging to other Rajput tribes, and a still smaller number of the Muhammadan religion.\n\nThe prosperity of this principality appears to have been at its highest about the middle of the last century, when R\u00e1o Desal is said to have possessed garrisons in Sind, in P\u00e1rkar and in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. These foreign possessions were lost by R\u00e1o L\u00e1kha, who succeeded in 1751 and in a reign of nine years dissipated the treasures of his father in expensive luxury. He was succeeded by his son R\u00e1o Godji, whose rebellion against his father, as well as his suspicious character, and his frequent change and even execution of his ministers, are proofs of the unsettled state of his territory. He was succeeded in 1778 by his son R\u00e1o R\u00e1y\u00e1dh\u00e1n the father of the late R\u00e1o Bh\u00e1ra or Bh\u00e1rmalji. R\u00e1o R\u00e1y\u00e1dh\u00e1n's understanding was deranged, and his madness was of such a nature as to require the strictest personal restraint. His brother Prithir\u00e1j (better known by the name of Bh\u00e1iji B\u00e1va) was too young to assume the direction of affairs and the government was conducted by twelve commanders of mercenary troops, who appear to have been all Muhammadans, and who were guided by the authority of Dosal Ven, the principal of their own body. Among these leaders was Fateh Muhammad, a native of Sind. This person appears to have been endued with capacity and courage. Finding the government of Dosal Ven at once weak and odious, he successfully intrigued with the troops, with the ministers by whom the civil business of the government was still conducted, and with some of the leading J\u00e1d\u00e9j\u00e1s; until in the year 1792, he was enabled to expel Dosal Ven and his colleagues and to transfer the reins of government into his own hands. He conducted the affairs of Cutch with firmness and ability for ten years, until Bh\u00e1iji B\u00e1va, in whose name as regent, Fateh Muhammad appears to have administered the government, became of an age to feel the hardships of his exclusion from the Regency. Hansr\u00e1j and other ministers who were dissatisfied with the predominance of Fateh Muhammad availed themselves of this feeling, and seizing the opportunity of a casual absence of Fateh Muhammad from the capital, they carried off Bh\u00e1iji to M\u00e1ndvi of which Hansr\u00e1j was at that time in charge. The wealth and the respectable character of Hansr\u00e1j, the junction of the other ministers, and the popular manners of Bh\u00e1iji joined to the goodness of his cause, soon drew the majority to his party and Fateh Muhammad was glad to abandon Bhuj and to compromise his claim to the administration, for the possession of the fort and dependencies of Anj\u00e1r. The death of Bh\u00e1iji, which happened in 1802 (16 months after the revolution), restored the ascendancy of Fateh Muhammad. Hansr\u00e1j was a merchant, and his wealth and popularity were insufficient to make up for the want of knowledge and confidence in military affairs. He withdrew to M\u00e1ndvi, leaving Bhuj to be captured by Fateh Muhammad while Lakhp\u00e1t Bandar, Mundra, Bitta, and S\u00eds\u00e1gad, with\ntheir districts remained in the hands of independent chiefs, who, though three of them were Muhammadans, were all close confederates of Hansraj.\n\nAll these parties were supported entirely by their mercenary troops, Arabs, Sindhis and Musalmans of Cutch. The Jadejas appear to have possessed but little weight and to have taken little interest in the struggle. Some remained at their forts entirely neutral, others served the contending parties for pay and although the Rao's person was in the hands of Fateh Muhammed and Hansraj had not even the shadow of legitimate authority, the greater part of the Bhayad were entertained in his service or attached to his party. Fateh Muhammed proceeded with vigour against such as came within his reach; he fomented their family quarrels; he besieged their forts and levied contributions on various pretences, as well to fill his treasury as to gratify his revenge: his necessities obliged him to impose numerous and severe taxes and fines on the merchants and ryots; but although these proceedings created general discontent there seems to have been no attempt to form any combination against him. He continued to govern the capital and the greater part of the Rao's territories, and to carry on depredations in the possessions of his rivals until his death; and the name of the Jamadar is now as much respected in Cutch as that of any of the Rao's, his predecessors in authority. The death of Fateh Muhammed took place in 1813; it was preceded by that of Hansraj and shortly followed by that of Rao Rayadhan. The incapacity of the Jamadar's son Husain Mia, enabled Shivraj (who succeeded his father in the possession of Mandvi) to occupy the capital and to call Rao Bharmal to the head of the government about a year after the death of Fateh Muhammed. Husain Mia fled to Anjar, where he remained unmolested until that place was taken by the British. Both he and Dosal Ven are now living in poverty and contempt.\n\nThough Rao Bharmal had attained to the age of twenty during his father's lifetime, there appears to have been no thought of setting up his claim to the Regency against those of the different usurpers, nor did he on his own accession recover possession of the portion of the country that he found in their hands. But within his own share he soon assumed the real exercise of the authority he had gained. Shivraj withdrew to Mandvi, and the business of the state was carried on for some time satisfactorily by ministers who had served under Fateh Muhammed.\n\nBut Rao Bharmalji had contracted a habit of constant intoxication, which disqualified him from business, secluded him from the society of his chiefs and ministers, and ultimately exasperated his temper and impaired his understanding. His misgovernment if left to its own operation would probably have ended like that of his father in his imprisonment and perhaps in the further partition of his dominions; but the invasion of Cutch by the force under Colonel East (which was rendered unavoidable by the depredations of the people of Vagad) led to the further interposition of the British Government and at last brought things into their present shape.\n\nThe district of Vagad, which comprehends all the eastern part of the Cutch territory, either had never been subjected to the Rao or had long ago thrown off its dependence on him. It paid at one time occasional tribute to the Nawab of Radhanpur; but the chiefs were no further controlled by any superior and continued to plunder the territories of all their neighbours including those of the Rao of Cutch. Their independence\nwas first broken by Fateh Muhammad who reduced some parts of V\u00e1gad under the R\u00e1o's direct authority, and levied annual contributions from all the chiefs of that country. He did not endeavour to restrain the predatory habits of those chiefs, and R\u00e1o Bh\u00e1rmalji's refusal either to punish their inroads into K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r or to allow the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r to do so, obliged us to commence military operations which ended in the first treaty.\n\nThat agreement was on the whole by no means unfavourable to the R\u00e1o. In the reduction of V\u00e1gad, the fines he levied on the chiefs and the establishment of a regular tribute, he obtained an ample equivalent for the compensation which he was obliged to afford to those who had been plundered by the inhabitants of that country; and the surrender of Anj\u00e1r was a moderate price for the restoration of M\u00e1ndvi and the other dismembered districts and for the arrears which he was enabled to recover from the usurpers of those possessions. His habits of intoxication prevented his enjoying these advantages. He fell into the hands of low flatterers and his distempered mind was urged on by their profligate councils. His offences against the British Government are too well known to require repetition. He alienated the minds of his subjects by the murder of his cousin Ladhubha (the son of Bh\u00e1iji B\u00e1va whose claim to the succession had at one time been set up in opposition to his own), alarmed his immediate adherents for their personal safety, and excited the enmity of the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s by attacks on individuals and even by a rash demand of a tribute from the whole body. Notwithstanding these provocations, such was the superiority of his mercenary force that the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s offered no opposition. They marched in his train against the forts of their brethren, and they reluctantly subscribed an engagement by which they bound themselves to pay the tax which was imposed on them. But their submission was the effect of fear alone; they secretly applied for the assistance of the British which in time was granted. Ten of the principal chiefs joined the army on its advance; and the present form of government together with the last treaty were settled in consultation with them. It was determined on all hands that Bh\u00e1rmalji should be imprisoned, but it is said to have been the wish of the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s that the government should still be administered in his name. When they saw that this was not intended, they seem to have been inclined to elect the son of Ladhubha, but were prevailed on by the arguments of Lakhmid\u00e1s to choose the present R\u00e1o. They likewise entered into a treaty in the name of the whole J\u00e1deja body and established the Regency which still conducts the government.\n\nAt the head of the Regency must be reckoned the British Resident who was introduced at the earnest request of the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s, and still more of the other members who refused to take on themselves the responsibility of the office without his full support and participation. The others were: Vaj\u00e9r\u00e1jj\u00ed or Vazer\u00e1jj\u00ed, the J\u00e1deja chief of Roha who derives consequence from his experience, from his possessions which exceed those of any other chief, from his military retinues and his fort which is reckoned next to Bhuji\u00e1 the strongest in Cutch; 2nd, Prithir\u00e1j\u00ed, the chief of N\u00e1garecha, who, though young and not distinguished for ability, was chosen on account of his family which is reckoned the first among the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s; 3rd, Lakhmid\u00e1s, whose family have long been ministers and who himself was prime minister to R\u00e1o Bh\u00e1rmalji; 4th, Odhavji R\u00e1jgar, a rich merchant who had been employed in charge of districts and had a high character in the country; and 5th, Ratansi, the nephew of Sundarji who, though his family have wealth and weight in Cutch, was probably elected in compliment to the British Government on the support of which\nhe still entirely depends. Upheld by that Government he may be considered as the principal member of the Regency, and he appears to conduct himself with good sense and moderation, so as to give perfect satisfaction to the English gentlemen with whom he has acted, at the same time that his conciliating manners exempt him from the unpopularity which his sudden elevation and his connection with the British Government might be expected to raise among the Jadejas.\n\nLakhidas possesses an influence in the Regency only inferior to that of Ratansi. He has long been in power, is looked up to by the Jadejas, and partakes in the character and feelings of the people of Cutch: from these qualities no less than from his ability in business he is a valuable member of the Regency.\n\nThese are the only efficient members. Vajerajji, a selfish old man accustomed to the solitary independence of his own fort and only entering into the affairs of Bhuj during the intrigues that preceded a revolution, takes little interest in ordinary business and seldom interferes unless to recommend some measure calculated to increase his influence or popularity. The other two were only expected to lend the aid of their names and they are now both dead, Odhavji within the last week.\n\nThe Rao's revenues being farmed out and each branch of his expenditure being fixed, the ordinary business of the Regency is to see that the farmers perform their contract and that the charges do not exceed the estimate; to check depredations and punish offences; and above all, to attend to the claims and decide the disputes of the Jadeja chiefs. At the most important of these cases the Resident assists as he does at all consultations on political questions, foreign or domestic, but he judiciously leaves the detail of the government to the other members and contents himself with obtaining a thorough knowledge of their proceedings over which he exercises an occasional control.\n\nThe Rao's land revenue amounts to 15,15,000 koris, and that derived from customs and other sources unconnected with the land to upwards of 14,00,000, in all about 29,50,000 koris, of which near 3,00,000 is alienated to maintain the ladies of the family, 3,00,000 for charitable purposes, and near 50,000 in Inam. His income therefore is only 23,00,000 koris (or Rs. 7,60,000) and his expenses, as shown by the annexed table A, amount to upwards of 24,00,000 koris (or 8 lakhs of Rupees) of which near 7,00,000 koris is the subsidy of the British Brigade. But some of these charges are of a temporary nature, and there seems little reason to doubt that in ordinary years the Rao will be easily able to live within his income.\n\nThe debt of the Government is 12,50,000 koris, of which upwards of a lakh is annually paid from a fund allotted to that object.\n\nHis troops consist of about 500 horse and 2000 infantry besides the contingent of the Jadejas. It is calculated that these chiefs could furnish 20,000 men, but admitting this to be the case, they can only be reckoned as a force of which the Rao can have the services whenever he is willing to pay for them. The number of this body that is really efficient probably does not exceed four or five thousand.\n\nThe internal government of the Rao's immediate demesne appears to be good. It is a great defect in the system that the revenue is farmed and the greater because the principal farmers are nearly related to members of the Regency; but the original tenures of the land are favourable to the cultivator; the superintendence of the Resident prevents.\ntheir being encroached on; the certainty of retaining the lease for five years is an inducement to the farmer to improve his country, while the neighbourhood of so many chiefs, in whose lands an oppressed ryot would find a refuge, is a check on his exactions. The competition of ryots likewise secures those on the lands of the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s from oppression, though they do not possess the favourable tenure which is general in the R\u00e1o's country. The tenure is called Buta. It gives a perpetual right of occupancy to the ryot on his paying a fixed proportion of his produce which varies in different places from one-half to one-eighth, but is generally one-third. That the ground is the R\u00e1o's appears never to be questioned, but the ryots sell their right in it without any opposition generally at a very short purchase (about 5 years).\n\nThe neighbourhood of Sind (on importation from which it at all times depends for a large portion of its subsistence) prevented Cutch from feeling the famine of 1813, so much as K\u00e1thi\u00e1war. It has never been so much harassed by plunderers and although the earthquake of 1819 was a severe calamity, it was not one of that sort which seriously affects the population or cultivation, so that Cutch is on the whole probably in as flourishing a condition as it ever has been.\n\nThe police is good notwithstanding the number of independent divisions; indeed, the example of this country and K\u00e1thi\u00e1war makes one question whether when the chiefs are really well disposed the number of persons possessing influence does not make up in police for the want of extensive jurisdiction. The only disturbers of the public peace appear to be the outlaws who find a refuge in the dependencies of Sind or in the desert. Justice is administered by the Patels and by Panch\u00e1yats and the people do not complain of the want of it.\n\nThe last revolution was effected at the request of the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s and the last treaty affords them a guarantee of their possessions. It might therefore be expected that they would be content and accordingly I have not been able to learn that any dissatisfaction exists among them. Three persons of that class came to me with complaints, but all related to oppressions committed by Bh\u00e1rmalji or Fateh Muhammed and not redressed by the present Regency. I had long separate interviews with more than twenty of the principal persons in Cutch, and although it was scarcely to be expected that they would be very unreserved on such an occasion, yet it is satisfactory to know that I gave them many openings in the course of conversation to discover their real sentiments and likewise put direct questions to them regarding the conduct of the Regency without hearing of anything offensive or inconsistent with former practice. One chief complained that the decisions of the Regency were not always just, but he confined himself to general censure, and I found that he had lately lost a cause by the Regency's confirming the award of a Panch\u00e1yat against which he had appealed.\n\nThe J\u00e1deja chiefs have been the great losers by the earthquake which demolished their forts, but they are still in a prosperous condition: few of them are much in debt, they have few disputes among themselves and no private wars. Some of them are reduced to poverty by the numerous sub-divisions of their estates, every younger brother being entitled to a share equal to one-third and often to one-half of that of the elder, but on the whole the number of estates that have descended to single heirs induces a suspicion that in Cutch infanticide is not confined to females.\n\nThe J\u00e1deja chiefs of Cutch are generally accused of treachery; poisoning is said to be a prevalent crime among them; but in what I have heard of\ntheir history, I have found no instance of it, and I perceive more of the unsteadiness that results from indifference than of deliberate treachery in their public conduct. This want of attachment to any sovereign is produced by their own independence of the R\u00e1o's authority and by the want of energy in the chief and consequent distraction in the administration which his government in common with most of those under Rajputs has almost always displayed. The appearance and behaviour of the chiefs though not much polished, is decent, manly, and prepossessing.\n\nThe character of the common people appears to be peaceable and inoffensive. The inhabitants of V\u00e1gad are said to retain their propensity to plunder, the Muhammadan herdsmen in the Banni (a tract of grass lands extending along the edge of the northern Ran) are reckoned fierce and unsettled; and the Mi\u00e1n\u00e1s (another Muhammadan tribe in the east of the R\u00e1o's territories) are notorious for their desperate character, always ready for hire to undertake any enterprise however dangerous or however flagitious. These tribes are under hereditary heads of their own.\n\nThe external relations of Cutch scarcely deserve to be mentioned. It has escaped the ravages and exactions of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and it has twice repelled invasions from Sind. Its offensive operations since the days of R\u00e1o Desal have been confined to three invasions of the north of K\u00e1thiaw\u00e1r by Fateh Muhammad and one incursion to V\u00e1r\u00e1hi in the neighbourhood of R\u00e1dhanpur. The use of a connection with Cutch to us is to curb the plunderers of V\u00e1gad, to check the Khos\u00e1s, to keep Sind at a distance, and to afford an opening into that country in the unwelcome event of our being engaged in a war with the Amirs. The most desirable situation of Cutch for us is that it should be under a strong and independent government. The first of these conditions was found to be unattainable and the want of strength has led to the loss of independence. We are now too deeply engaged in the affairs of Cutch ever to retreat, and the option reserved to us of withdrawing from the subsidiary alliance is rendered nugatory by our guarantee of the rights of the R\u00e1o and of the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s. Of all our alliances this is probably the most intimate and the most difficult to dissolve, since to free us from its obligations requires the consent not of one Prince but of 200 Nobles.\n\nIt is therefore of the most importance to consider the manner in which our influence is to be exerted. During the R\u00e1o's minority we must continue to superintend and control every branch of the government, but our Resident's interference should be confined, as at present, to superintendence. While Ratansi is properly supported he will always have a preponderance in the Regency, and will guide it in the direction which is given to it by our Government.\n\nUnless the Resident be supine Lakhmid\u00e1s will be an adequate counterpoise to Ratansi's influence; the very knowledge that there exists such a rival ready to communicate any misconduct of his to the Resident will be sufficient to make Ratansi cautious and moderate; and as it is the policy of Lakhmid\u00e1s and must be the ambition of every J\u00e1deja in the Regency to maintain the principles most popular among their countrymen, the Resident, if he shows himself disposed to listen to their communications, can never be ignorant of any action adverse to the ancient practice or the public feeling. The chief business of the Resident must be to watch over the conduct of his colleagues in those points where they are likely to be united by a common interest. In the internal management of the R\u00e1o's country he ought not to exercise so minute a control as to\ndestroy the spirit or lessen the responsibility of the other members. When any great change of system is proposed, it is, of course, his duty to examine it carefully; but except on such occasions, it is enough if he readily listens to complaints and calls for explanations when they seem to be well founded. In all measures affecting the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s he ought to take a more active part. Experience has shown that they are ready to submit to a government of ministers supported by a power unconnected with their own, and it is probable that as long as their personal honour and interest are attended to, they will be, if not friendly, at least indifferent to our proceedings; but it is necessary that they should be treated with attention and civility and that care should be taken not to encroach on their privileges. The vigilance of the Resident should guard against the negligence, partiality, or corruption which may be evinced by the Regency in deciding on the quarrels of the chiefs. His authority should repress all attempts on their part to renew the practice of plunder or of private war; and his moderation should guard against the temptation of adding to the R\u00e1o's possessions by forfeitures even in cases where the resistance of a chief should have required the employment of a military force. Without this precaution a slight offence will lead to a fine; delay in payment, to the employment of a detachment; and that to the dispossession of the individual and the discontent and alarm of all the other J\u00e1dej\u00e1s. A fine has been the usual punishment and ought still to be sufficient; and if it should be absolutely necessary to dispossess a chief, the disinterestedness of the Government should be shown by restoring his lands to his next heir. The three most probable points of difference with the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s are, settling their disputes among themselves; enforcing the prohibition of female infanticide; and compelling them to act against plunderers within their own districts. In the first, all danger may be averted by the prompt and impartial administration of justice; in the second, by caution and delicacy in the means of detecting guilt and moderation in punishing it. The third is an object of great importance. It is more likely to be attained by vigilance than by severity, by explaining what is expected, consuring neglect, and compelling restitution with the addition of a fine as the punishment of participation. Great care should be taken to avoid any appearance of arrogance in our treatment of the J\u00e1deja chiefs; but I do not think there is any necessity for referring political questions to the decision of their body to the extent which a superficial view of the correspondence of the Residency would lead us to think usual. It is natural to suppose that the former R\u00e1os would consult the principal J\u00e1dej\u00e1s before they entered on any measure that required the cordial co-operation of the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d, and, in the absence of an efficient sovereign, it is still more necessary that the Regency should learn the sentiments of that body, but it does not appear to be usual, or to be expected, or to be practicable that all should be assembled to give their votes even on the most important questions. The Resident should continue to consult the greatest chiefs separately or together as he thinks best suited to the occasion, and may extend or confine the number according to the importance of the question; but I should think fifty or sixty the greatest number that need ever be consulted. These are all the general observations that suggest themselves, but there are various subjects of temporary importance which require our immediate attention.\n\nThe first is the situation of the late R\u00e1o.\n\nThe odium of that prince's measures has been lost in the sight of his misfortunes and all fear of his power among the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s has been removed by the British guarantee. The consequence is that he is now an object of general compassion, and, under the erroneous impression that our\npower would afford a sufficient security against a renewal of his misconduct, the greater part of his late subjects would probably be glad to see him restored to the masnad. An opinion prevails of the indefeasible rights of a Prince to the nominal exercise at least of a sovereignty which he has once possessed and this is shown by the language of the people of Cutch who, when off their guard, generally call Bh\u00e1rmalji the R\u00e1o, and R\u00e1o Desal, only the Kunvar or Prince. I consulted several of the principal persons in Cutch about the succession to the Masnad in the event of the death of R\u00e1o Desal, and all who delivered their sentiments with frankness declared at once for Bh\u00e1rmalji, although all agreed that he ought to be kept in prison and the Government administered by a Regency.\n\nThe wives of Bh\u00e1rmalji, especially the mother of the present R\u00e1o, are all naturally anxious to promote his interests and with them go the wishes and intrigues of all the inhabitants of the palace. R\u00e1o Bh\u00e1rmalji must have some adherents especially among the soldiery who were disbanded at his fall; any unpopularity of the present Government would throw the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s into his seal; the dwelling which he inhabits being built more for commodiousness than security, might easily allow of his escape; and the Mi\u00e1n\u00e1s and Jats would soon supply him with a desperate band who might protect him until further support could be obtained. For these reasons it seems highly desirable to remove Bh\u00e1rmalji from Cutch or at least from Bhuj; but this is unfortunately prevented by a stipulation in the treaty. The dangers I have alluded to can therefore only be counteracted by greater attention to the security of his person and by destroying the impression that he is ever to recover his power. To show the resolution of the British Government I declined seeing him (although in the least offensive terms) and I rejected all the applications that were made to me to allow him to return to the palace. My correspondence with the Resident will show my sentiments regarding his restoration to his family in which I think humanity requires every indulgence that can safely be conceded, but I should think it a most desirable arrangement if he could be removed to some place of strength more completely cut off from the town.\n\nThe next step that occurs for destroying the chance of his recovering his influence is to call on the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s to declare an heir to the present R\u00e1o, but this on examination appears both unnecessary and impolitic. As Bh\u00e1rmalji has already been pronounced by the treaty to have forfeited the government as fully as can be done in any public instrument, nothing could be gained by a new declaration to that effect, and as it has never been disputed that the next heir is the chief of Kh\u00e1khar descended from the R\u00e1ja Godji, the only effect of a call for a declaration would be to invite a fruitless and probably an angry discussion. It is also not improbable that R\u00e1o Bh\u00e1rmalji may yet have children whom it would be both unpopular and unjust to set aside; the insanity or incapacity of their father being certainly no bar to their claim and there being no distinction between the title which would be possessed by such children and that which has actually been admitted in the person of R\u00e1o Desal. It seems therefore most expedient to treat the question of the succession as already settled and to admit no further mention of Bh\u00e1rmalji's restoration.\n\nThe Regency ought no doubt to be filled up and as the object is to gain the confidence of the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s as well as to have a natural mode of ascertaining their feelings I should think it desirable that the choice should fall on two J\u00e1dej\u00e1s. I have requested the Resident to take the\nopinions of as many chiefs as he conveniently can on this subject, and to be guided by the prevailing sentiment among them. The new Regents should understand that after the expiration of the present lease no member of the Regency will be allowed to be a farmer of the revenue.\n\nThe exposed and unconnected situation of Anj\u00e1r suggested a question whether it might not be politic to restore it to the R\u00e1o's Government taking a money payment instead; and if this payment could be well secured I do not see a single advantage in keeping the district. As long as our influence at Bhuj continues, it is of no use whatever, and if that influence were to expire, it would require a strong force to defend it; even then, the jealousy it would occasion between us and the R\u00e1o would probably soon involve us, as it did before, in hostilities with that Prince. The only questions therefore are, whether we can obtain adequate security for the revenue we give up, and whether it would be satisfactory to the ryots if Anj\u00e1r be restored to the R\u00e1o. The failure of the Cutch Government in paying the subsidy makes the answer to the first of these questions very doubtful. I have referred both to the Resident for his report.\n\nIt would be popular to restore the fort of Bhujia to the R\u00e1o and it would be popularity easily purchased, for the fort is, I believe, incapable of being defended especially in its present state; but as it commands our cantonments it would be necessary to move the brigade to some other ground. If a good position could be found near Bhuj (for it ought not I think to be at any distance from the R\u00e1o's person) it would be desirable to remove the brigade thither and to construct a redoubt within which a residence might be erected for the late R\u00e1o and where the stores &c. might be deposited if the force were obliged to move. The expense of such a work would however be considerable, and it will be necessary to call for an estimate before it can be determined on. At any rate the cantonment can be moved and some sort of field work thrown up for the stores. The present force in Cutch appears to me no more than sufficient. It would be insufficient if we had any reason to distrust the good will of the inhabitants. The detachments at P\u00e1tan and R\u00e1jkot could however reinforce it within a fortnight.\n\nThe wish of the people of Bhuj is strongly in favour of repairing their walls, which I think ought to be done as soon as the finances of the state will admit of it. The same observations apply to Lakhp\u00e1t bandar, but I do not think it necessary to incur the expense of repairing Anj\u00e1r which we could never spare an adequate force to defend.\nAppendix C.\n\nSir John Malcolm's Minute.\n\nAmong other reasons for visiting Cutch, one was my desire to possess myself of information on the spot before I proposed a reply to the letter of the Secret Committee of the 9th January 1829, relative to our connection with it, from which they express their desire this Government either to withdraw 'from all interference in the affairs of that country, or by so increasing our influence over the Government, as to enable ourselves to wield all its resources, and to give to the inhabitants something which would be worth their fighting for.'\n\n2. The Secret Committee after communicating their sentiments upon the whole subject in order to guide the proceedings of this Government, conclude with the following just remark. 'The opportunity of effecting that object (alluding to our withdrawing from the alliance) should we determine on prosecuting it, might not be afforded before the period at which the Rao will attain his majority. Much previous preparation will in any case be required before we can safely change the line of policy upon which we have, however undecidedly, been acting for many years; but it is always an advantage to know what we want, and to have a distinct object in view. If the object of a Government be always the same, the changes produced by time will ultimately afford the means of obtaining it, but neither success nor credit is to be found in the following, languidly or without plan, decision, or pertinacity, any object, however desirable may be its possession.'\n\n3. Though it is not necessary to enter upon the past history of Cutch, as that has been recently very fully illustrated, it will be useful, before I offer my sentiments as to the practicability or policy of withdrawing or materially changing our connexion with this state, to refer to the progress of our connection since its formation and its actual condition at the present period.\n\n4. In 1802 Hansraj, the governor of Mandvi, who had then gained a temporary ascendancy at Bhuj, offered to cede Cutch to the British Government on the condition that it would grant a maintenance to the Rao R\u00e1yadhan and his relations. This proposal was changed in 1804 to one for subsidizing a body of British troops. In 1807, the latter offer came again from Hansraj and Fateh Muhammad conjointly: but they were informed (on this as on the two former occasions) that we did not wish to interfere with the affairs of Cutch.\n\n5. In 1809 Fateh Muhammad proceeded on his fifth expedition against Nav\u00e1nagar, and was met at Hari\u00e1na (a town south of the gulf of Cutch) by an agent on the part of Colonel Walker who was then employed in settling K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r.\n\n---\n\n1 Dated D\u00e1pur\u00ed, June 1830.\n2 The Memoir of Cutch lately printed by Mr. Burnes, the Surgeon of the Residency, is very full and correct.\nAppendix C.\n\nSir J. Malcolm's Minute.\n\n1830.\n\n6. A treaty was entered into (to which both Fateh Muhammad and Hansraj were parties) providing for the suppression of piracy out of all ports of Cutch; that no troops from Cutch should cross the Ran into K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, or eastward into Gujar\u00e1t, or its dependencies; that the British Government should arbitrate and settle the claims of the Bhuj Darb\u00e1r against that of Nav\u00e1nagar; and that it should warn the Amirs of Sind against any attempt to occupy Cutch.\n\n7. In 1812, this treaty was found to have been set at nought by the Cutch contracting authorities, Hansraj had died some time before, and his son Shivraj, who succeeded him in his usurped power, levied a tax on all boats entering the gulf of Cutch, even though sailing under British passports and colours. Every bay and creek along the coast was the haunt of pirates, and Fateh Muhammad had openly harboured a celebrated one of the name of Husain Nokva, who had plundered a vessel belonging to or freighted by prince Dosal of Cabul. The Jamadar had also sent marauding parties of horse into K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, had himself moved in command of a considerable force to attack S\u00e1ntalpur a dependency of R\u00e1dhanpur, and had given protection to a Sindian who had assassinated a British officer, Captain Phelan, H. M.'s 47th Regiment.\n\n8. Captain MacMurdo was deputed with a marine armament to remonstrate against these gross infractions of engagements, and succeeded without difficulty in bringing Shivraj Hansraj to terms. The troops that had gone from Bhuj against S\u00e1ntalpur were ordered back, and measures were in progress for attacking the V\u00e1gad plunderers (as the Darb\u00e1r's own mercenaries were called) when Fateh Muhammad suddenly died, and the country was thrown into complete confusion.\n\n9. On the death of Fateh Muhammad, his two sons, Husain Mia and Ibr\u00e1him Mia, took his place as the directors of affairs of the state, and continued to keep the R\u00e1o in custody as a pageant in whose name they acted. The two brothers were divided in their sentiments as to listening to the remonstrances of the British Government, but at length they invited Captain MacMurdo to Bhuj, to whom they stated in explanation that the troops had gone against S\u00e1ntalpur under an idea that it did not come within the meaning of the treaty of 1809; that the pirate Husain Nokva and the murderer of Captain Phelan should be given up if found in Cutch; and that a force should be sent into V\u00e1gad to put down the banditti.\n\n10. Captain MacMurdo accompanied the force into V\u00e1gad, and during its stay in that province, the plunderers disappeared. At the expiration of six weeks Captain MacMurdo crossed the Ran into K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, but had hardly arrived there before he heard that the youngest son of Fateh Muhammad had separated from the elder, and gone over to the chief of Mundra who had always opposed any thing like concession to our demands; while K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r was devastated by plundering parties of horse and foot.\n\n11. The British Government now felt itself called on to change its remonstrances into threats of punishment, which so terrified Fateh Muhammad's eldest son, who was naturally of a very timid disposition, that he joined the Mundra faction, and the whole of Fateh Muhammad's family evinced by their words and actions perfect indifference to our connection or alliance. The marauding system increased tenfold; trade was almost stopped from pirates; Husain Nokva was invited back from Sind, whither he was said to have retired, and the murderer of Captain Phelan was taken into the service of the chief of Mundra.\n12. The reconciliation of the two brothers was followed by the murders of the minister Jagjiwan Mehta, and his brother R\u00e1mcandra, while another brother of this Hindu family caused himself to be buried alive. About three weeks subsequent to these horrid events, Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Mia (the youngest of Fateh Muhamm\u00e1d's sons) was stabbed to the heart in the Darb\u00e1r by a M\u00e1rv\u00e1di jam\u00e1d\u00e1r, in presence of his elder brother Husain, and the minister Lakhmid\u00e1s. Husain suspecting that the R\u00e1o had, through his guards, instigated the fate of his brother, exchanged them for a body of Arabs, and having taken the M\u00e1rv\u00e1di soldiery by surprise, he put the whole of them, to the number of three hundred, to death.\n\n13. From the time of these atrocities, there was literally no government in Cutch for many weeks; Husain Mia shut himself up in a house, afraid to trust to any one; the Arabs levied fines and exactions as they thought proper, and several of the towns refused obedience to the orders sent from the capital.\n\n14. Husain Mia had by this time so completely shown his incapacity and pusillanimity that the minister Shivr\u00e1j Hansr\u00e1j and \u00c1skarn having conferred with some of the J\u00e1deja chiefs removed him from his situation as executive head of the state, and set at liberty the R\u00e1o who immediately assumed the reins of government. An application was made to this prince on the part of the British Government for redress of injuries which he not only refused but turned its native agent out of Bhuj, under the plea of employing Sundarji Sivji in that capacity; and as if resolved to make himself enemies in all quarters, he insulted by his supercilious conduct the J\u00e1d\u00e9jas who had come to Bhuj to be present at his marriage, most of whom returned to their estates in great disgust.\n\n15. About this time a British force was ordered to reduce Jodiya to the authority of its rightful owner, the J\u00e1m of Nav\u00e1nagar; and it was discovered that men and ammunition had been sent from Bhuj to assist in its defence. It fell, however, so easily that R\u00e1o Bh\u00e1rmalji took alarm and with a view to appease the indignation of the British Government, moved into V\u00e1gad with the avowed determination of suppressing the banditti, but either unable or disinclined to do so, he marched back to Bhuj in fifteen days. The depredations of the banditti, which had been suspended during the R\u00e1o's presence in V\u00e1gad were now renewed with redoubled vigour. In the space of a few months 136 villages in K\u00e1thhi\u00e1war were plundered; 40,000 head of cattle were carried off, and property to the amount of eight lakhs was damaged and destroyed in addition to which losses the British Government had expended ten lacs of rupees in defensive, though fruitless, measures.\n\n16. Captain MacMurdo was now instructed to make specific demands for compensation for the past; security for the future; the surrender of the children of the famous freebooter Sum\u00e1ji; and an apology for the double insult offered in expelling our agent from Bhuj, and in delaying to send Vakils to treat, as had been long promised. No answers were afforded to these demands within the specified time; and it was not till after Colonel East's force had entered Cutch, taken Anj\u00e1r, and advanced within six miles of the capital that the R\u00e1o entered into a treaty, by which he agreed to pay twenty lakhs of rupees as an indemnification for all losses and expenses; to cede to us the pargana and town of Anj\u00e1r, with its dependent bandar of Tuna; to pay us further an annual tribute of two lakhs of koris;\u00b9 to prevent the future excesses of the V\u00e1gad banditti; to suppress\n\n\u00b9 Koris may be calculated at three to one rupee.\npiracy; to prevent Europeans of whatever nation from interfering with the affairs, or passing through the territories, of Cutch; to dismiss and prohibit all Arab mercenaries with the exception of a garrison of four hundred men for Lakhpat bandar and not to harbour outlaws or bah\u00e1rvat\u00e1s from their Highnesses the Peshwa's or G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r's territories. In return for these concessions we agreed to reduce the province of V\u00e1gad, and all refractory chieftains to the subjection of the R\u00e1o's paramount authority, and to mediate all causes of disagreement or disaffection that might spring up in future.\n\n17. The Marquis of Hastings afterwards excused our portion of the twenty lakhs of rupees (estimated at eight lakhs) and also gave up all claim to the promised tribute. The remaining articles of the treaty were duly fulfilled, and a tribute of 40 koris per annum on each plough was fixed on V\u00e1gad. Captain MacMurdo was appointed Collector at Anj\u00e1r, and Resident in Cutch. The R\u00e1o raised the twelve lakhs of rupees, which he had to pay, by fines on his refractory chieftains, and demands under the name of voluntary contributions from those who had long enjoyed the revenue from different parts of the country.\n\n18. As soon as the British troops moved out of Cutch, and R\u00e1o Bh\u00e1rmalji felt himself relieved from the terror their presence had excited, he gave way to the natural bent of his inclinations. He became addicted to constant intoxication and the lowest sensuality, and the whole power of the Government fell into the hands of his profligate favourites, men of the meanest and most depraved characters, whose principal object was to instil into his mind suspicions of his new allies, and particularly of their representative Captain MacMurdo. The revenues for eight months in advance were seized from the cultivators of the soil and twenty lakhs of koris exacted in fines from the househ old officers, and the managers of districts, to be dissipated in the grossest debauchery. No man of any wealth was safe in the country. The J\u00e1deja chiefs with scarcely one exception retired to their estates, and never visited Bhuj.\n\n19. These scenes were brought to a crisis by the R\u00e1o's murder of his cousin Ladhubha, an act which excited the most unqualified horror in all classes. The British Government made an application in favour of the widow of the deceased chief which so highly incensed the murderer that he immediately raised Arab troops to attack Anj\u00e1r, in consequence of which Captain MacMurdo called in another regiment from K\u00e1thi\u00e1war which had the effect of making him disband the new levies.\n\n20. Cutch was now in a more miserable state than even in the worst times of R\u00e1o R\u00e1yadhan and every means that he could devise were adopted by Bh\u00e1rmalji to insult and injure the British Government. He levied so high a duty on cotton bought in his villages by merchants of Anj\u00e1r that all trade in that staple was at an end; and he prohibited boats from other ports in his dominions resorting to that of Tuna. Captain MacMurdo proceeded to Bhuj, at great personal risk, to expostulate on these aggressions, but he experienced nothing but insult and was compelled to return to Anj\u00e1r without effecting any good.\n\n21. All the ministers at Bhuj, except Lakhmid\u00e1s and Ratansi, now quitted the capital, as the only means of saving their lives; and the J\u00e1deja chiefs applied to the Bombay Government for its advice and aid in extricating the province from the misrule and misery into which it had been plunged, which they proposed to effect, by deposing Bh\u00e1rmalji.\nThis application, however, was negatived, and it is impossible to surmise what might have been the result had not the R\u00e1o placed himself in the light of an enemy by directly molesting our villages in the Anj\u00e1r pargana, and by attacking the town of A'desar in V\u00e1gad, at a time when its chief was, in conformity with the first treaty, in attendance on Captain MacMurdo for the settlement of his differences with the Darb\u00e1r.\n\n22. A force under Sir William Keir was, by orders from the Governor General, sent into Cutch. Captain MacMurdo was ordered to confer with the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s, and after the fort of Bhujia which overlooks the capital had been taken by escalade, the R\u00e1o delivered himself up, was formally deposed, his son (an infant of three years of age) elected in his stead, and a treaty made, on his part by the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s, in which after confirming most of the articles of the treaty of 1816, he agreed to pay a subsidy of two lakhis of rupees per annum, and we guaranteed 'the integrity of his dominions' from all foreign and domestic enemies. We also guaranteed the possessions of the whole of the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s on the single condition that they would preserve their female children.\n\n23. A regency was immediately nominated consisting of five persons, to which number the British Resident was afterwards added as president at the repeated and earnest request of the original members; and the affairs of the province have been since administered by this body with the occasional advice of the J\u00e1deja Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d or brotherhood. By a new agreement concluded between the British and Cutch Governments in June 1822, Anj\u00e1r and its dependencies were restored to the R\u00e1o on his paying to us their yearly estimated revenue of Rs. 88,000, making the entire sum we annually receive from the Cutch Government, Rs. 2,80,000.\n\n24. From this concise statement of the progress of our connection with Cutch it will be sufficiently evident it has been forced upon us in order to protect K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r and the commerce of the coast from increasing bands of pirates and of plunderers, and it is further evident that were we to abandon the connection to-morrow, we should have the same evils to encounter, and be in all probability put to a far greater expense, and become subject to much more embarrassment than we ever can, by preserving the alliance. On these grounds therefore, it is not expedient to withdraw, but, were it so, the maintenance of our faith renders such a measure impracticable. It is now eight years since this country has been subject to the regency before mentioned, and it has during that period enjoyed a comparative tranquillity beyond what it ever before knew. The ex-R\u00e1o Bharmalji lives in the house of his son, and for some period past has been subject to no restraint, for the British guard over him has been for some time a mere ceremony. His character is said to be much changed, and he appears reconciled to his condition, but if he is not, he has small means, if any, of exciting disturbance. The reigning prince (R\u00e1o Desal), with whom I had much intercourse when at Bhuj, is a youth of uncommon promise and he has had advantages which few in his situation have enjoyed. The Resident Lieutenant-Colonel Pottinger has attended with much care and solicitude to his education, and every pains has been taken to render him worthy of his condition. He has reaped great benefit from the lessons of the Reverend Mr. Gray, Chaplain at Bhuj. That respectable clergyman takes a most anxious interest in the improvement of his pupil and the young R\u00e1o gave me proof at every interview I had with him, that the instruction he had received had not been cast away. It was pleasing to hear him in conversation continually referring to the observations of Mr.\nGray, whom he described as being most kind and attentive to him and giving him information on all subjects. He repeated to me axioms that he had been taught, and the principles that had been instilled into his mind, and was amusing in his eagerness to show the information he had acquired of the action of steam and other matters in which his knowledge, though superficial, he could not help observing, was superior to that of those of his own tribe, by whom he was surrounded.\n\n25. I dwell on these facts because in a petty state like Cutch everything depends upon the character of the prince; to it we must trust for all stability that can be attained in such an alliance. It is to princes and chiefs in a state like Cutch that we must look for the reform of tribes like those who inhabit this country. We have in our treaties made great sacrifices to abolish infanticide, though, I fear, not with that effect which was so earnestly desired. Through the influence and example alone of popular princes or chiefs can this object be accomplished, and these considerations give importance to every effort made to promote the improvement of the acknowledged head of the Jadejas.\n\n26. I saw all the Jadeja chiefs of Cutch that were at Bhuj. Lieutenant-Colonel Pottinger informed me before they came, that they were anxious about three points: 1st, the removal of the guard from the ex-Rao; 2nd, the Rao Desal being introduced more into public affairs; and lastly, the diminution of the amount paid for Anjar, which, it was stated, was evidently more than the revenue realized, and pressed hard upon the limited resources of the principality.\n\n27. These requests were successively made as the Resident had stated. To the first I replied that the alliance with Cutch had hitherto been a source of more trouble and expense to the British Government than of political benefit or pecuniary resource. That if expediency alone was consulted, it would be abandoned, but our faith was pledged to the prince and to the chiefs, and would be maintained as long as they fulfilled their obligations. That Rao Desal though yet young (only fourteen) gave extraordinary promise, and that the country had for some period known an interval of tranquillity to which it was before a stranger. The ex-Rao I had been assured was penitent for his former crimes, and sincerely attached to his son, and was believed to have abandoned all hopes of restoration to the rank he had by his conduct forfeited. That owing to these circumstances the restraint under which he had been at first placed, had been gradually relaxed until the guard over him was literally no more than one of honour. That he lived in the palace with his son with whom he had free and constant intercourse, and might, no doubt, if he was foolish enough to desire it, effect his escape; but this was in the opinion of the Resident, and of those most deeply interested in maintaining the present order of affairs, not to be apprehended; and as I found the young prince, the minister and all the Jadeja chiefs, anxious on the ground of honourable feeling, for the removal of the appearance of confinement (for it was nothing more), I had no hesitation in complying with their request; and I was happy that this mark of confidence was coincident with the removal of one of the corps from the force stationed at Bhuj, as no two measures could show more clearly the foundations on which we desired the alliance to rest, a complete conviction on the minds of the prince and his chiefs of the value of the protection they received, and of the principles on which it was afforded them. If, I said (which God forbid), any evils resulted from compliance with their request, on their head should be the consequence. The British Government would be emancipated from\nengagements that could alone be beneficial from their continuing to preserve peace, to promote improvement, and to render the inhabitants of Cutch worthy of its friendship. Those that now heard me, I added, might, if subsisting ties were broken, implore in vain for that succour by which they had been saved from ruin. The minister Lakhmid\u00e1s, in the name of the young R\u00e1o, and the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s on their own part, expressed much gratitude for the promised removal of the guard. It took off, they said, a reproach from the family of their rulers, and they would give, as they had before signified to the Resident, an engagement which increased their individual responsibility for maintaining R\u00e1o Desal and his descendants on the masnad to the perpetual exclusion of the ex-R\u00e1o Bh\u00e1rmalji who, they said, was reconciled to his condition, and, if not, neither possessed, nor could create, means of regaining authority.\n\n28. To the next request of the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s, I observed that I saw no objection to the name of the R\u00e1o Desal being introduced into public deeds, and his being gradually initiated into the management of his own affairs, but he was yet too young to be released at once from that tuition and control to which he owed so much; but that it would be the anxious desire of the Resident acting in conformity with the former instructions of Government to apportion the weight of business to the growing strength of the young prince, who, if his education was completed in the manner it had been commenced, might within a few years, be fully equal to bear the whole burden, and prove in the exercise of power the happy instrument of working great reforms in his native country.\n\n29. To the request for a decrease in the annual payment to the British Government, I gave a decided negative. If the Anj\u00e1r revenue had fallen short of the expected amount, it was, I said, owing to causes that were not likely to recur. Other resources had increased and were likely to increase from the tranquillity which the country enjoyed, and which was to be exclusively referred to the British protection. As to the augmented expenses which they pleaded from the R\u00e1o's marriage, and the state necessary to be supported, as well as the charges for the establishment of the ex-R\u00e1o, these must be reduced, if the revenue was unequal to defray them. The condition of the finances of the British Government, and the expensive establishments it supported, forbade, I informed them, the surrender of any part of the pecuniary subsidy from Cutch; while on the other hand, the latter state was by treaty ensured against any increase of demand. At this part of the conference, I took an opportunity of explaining to the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s and their relations, assembled to the amount of nearly one hundred, my sentiments of the unexampled consideration with which they had been treated, and the bad return they had as yet made for such liberal usage. 'Your lands' (I said) 'have been guaranteed to you and your descendants by the British Government without the stipulation of one kori of pecuniary payment to it or to your prince, and without fixing any specific aid of troops in the event of invasion, or of the public peace being disturbed. You have subsequently permitted small and despicable bands of plunderers to traverse the country, and carry off booty from the principal towns of your prince. I have desired the Resident and the minister to inform me of the name of any person that distinguished himself on the late incursion of the Mi\u00e1n\u00e1s; but not one name has been brought to my notice, and I find that a large body of Rajput chiefs boasting the name of J\u00e1dej\u00e1s, and of devoted allegiance to their ruler, considering themselves shielded by our too generous guarantee from the just resentment of their prince, made not one effort to protect his towns from plunderers, or his fields from devastation, apparently satisfied if they\nsaved their own estates from similar evils: and in some instances it is strongly suspected that the exemption of these from attack was the price of a base, if not a traitorous, inactivity.'\n\n30. 'This has past,' I observed, 'but let it be known in future that there is nothing in the b\u00e1hidhari or guarantee obligation which the British Government has given to the chiefs of Cutch that exempts them from their allegiance, and the aid which in virtue of that they are bound to give their prince on every occasion, where his person or his property was at hazard. And any chief who is hereafter supine, and who does not exert himself to the utmost, to oppose and destroy his enemies or plunderers, will be dealt with as one who aids them; and shall, as the slightest punishment, be proclaimed to have forfeited all rights to British protection.'\n\n31. 'The Resident,' I added, 'had been instructed by me to communicate with all the chiefs individually upon this subject which was one of much importance for them fully to understand. He would explain to them the mode in which they could best fulfil obligations that belonged to their condition, and which were not specified in any engagement or treaty, because they were implied as duties that could neither be evaded nor neglected without the total dissolution of those ties by which a government like that of Cutch could alone be maintained under its present form and administration.'\n\n32. These sentiments were fully explained by me to the assembled chiefs; and that there might be no mistake they were repeated in my name by the minister Lakhmidas. No observations were offered in reply, though they were invited to do so, beyond some of the senior J\u00e1dej\u00e1s expressing their assent to the fairness and justice of what I had stated, and their resolution to merit by their future conduct, the benefits they derived from the protection of the British Government.\n\n33. I took the opportunity of this large concourse of chiefs to give my sentiments most fully on the subject of infanticide. 'They knew,' I said, 'the solicitude of the British Government regarding the abolition of that most barbarous crime, which so far from being countenanced, or sanctioned by the usages of Hindustan, was held in utter execration by all of that race except the few tribes of Rajputs by whom it was introduced, and continued to be practised from motives of family pride.' 'The J\u00e1dej\u00e1s of Cutch,' I remarked, 'whom I am now addressing, have long been reproached with this horrid and inhuman usage. From the first of our connection with this state, its abolition has been a subject of most anxious solicitude. The hope of effecting it was recognized as a motive for the alliance, and engagements were entered into by J\u00e1deja chiefs that I fear have been little respected.' 'I know,' I added, 'the difficulty of persuading men to abandon this practice, however abhorrent to nature; but believe me, you will hazard by the continuance of infanticide the protection of the British Government, for the crime is held in such detestation in England, that the nation will not long be reconciled to intimate friendship with a race of men by whom it continues to be perpetrated in direct breach of their promises and engagements.' The solemn warning I gave them on this subject was (I concluded) dictated by an anxious solicitude for their welfare, and for the happy operation of an alliance which promised such benefits to their country while it would tend, if all its obligations were fulfilled and objects attained, to promote the reputation, and, with it, the interests of the British Government.\n\n34. A copy of these notes of my conference with the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s should\nbe sent to Lieutenant-Colonel Pottinger for record in his office, and he may be instructed to take every opportunity of impressing these chiefs with the importance of their fully understanding and acting upon principles and feelings which are equally essential for their own good, and to secure to them and their descendants a continuance of the favour and protection which they now enjoy. The Resident should also be instructed to make the young prince fully acquainted with all that had passed on this occasion.\n\n35. My communications with the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s, and the line of conduct I prescribed to the Resident, were grounded upon the conviction that no motives but dread of the superior power of the British Government, and reliance upon its faith could restrain them for a moment, from those outrages which for generations have been habitual to this class of chiefs. These yield a respect bordering upon veneration, as far as outward show, to the family of their ruler, considering him the head of that aristocracy among whom Cutch has been long divided, but with all their professions of allegiance, they have never hesitated, when it suited their personal interests or gratified their passions of revenge or ambition, to rebel against his authority, to plunder his lands, and at times to dethrone or murder the occupant of the masnad, placing however one of his family in his place.\n\n36. This conduct on their part has led their princes to similar acts of violence when they have had absolute power either through the aid of some of their dependent chiefs or foreign mercenaries. The poverty of Cutch and its salubrity have hitherto alike operated to disturb its peace. Men of a robust frame and with predatory habits have increased in a proportion beyond what the country could maintain in a manner suited to their wants, and it may be affirmed that these causes combined with the usages and character of its foreign conquerors the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s, have led to more crimes and more acts of violence, injustice, and atrocity being committed within the last century in this small and insulated country than in almost any part of the world with which we are acquainted.\n\n37. In dictating that treaty with the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s on which the present connection is founded, it is much to be regretted that we guaranteed their estates and freed them from all specific duty or payment to their prince without imposing one obligation upon them in return except that they should abandon the horrid practice of infanticide. This humane article of the treaty has, I fear, been much disregarded, and we possess no means of enforcing its strict fulfilment.\n\n38. Secure in our protection and freed by it from all supervision or responsibility in the management of their estates, the J\u00e1deja chiefs have become indolent and indifferent to all matters that do not immediately affect their personal interests. Lost in the enjoyment of sensual pleasures they neglect all improvement and endeavour to supply funds for such a course of life by every means of oppression and outrage they can venture upon without the hazard of their property. Not above one has exposed his estate to forfeiture, but that should be rigidly enforced whenever they join in rebellion or fail in their efforts to guard the country from foreign plunderers. They should in such case either be deprived of their estates or be subjected to heavy fines, naz\u00e1na, to their prince on succession or adoption, which they fully recognize should be strictly enforced and fixed upon as high a scale as usage warranted. The chiefs of Cutch have encroached upon their ruler, till his revenues bear no just proportion to his condition as their head, and it should be a principle of our policy to take every fair advantage of events to increase his powe\nAppendix C.\n\nSir J. Malcolm's Minute.\n\n1830.\n\nto the diminution of that depraved, disobedient, and unmanageable class of petty chiefs, whose existence in their actual state is at variance with all plans of improvement and calculated to render unprofitable, if not to destroy, the alliance we have formed with this principality.\n\n39. I have recommended to the Resident the only measures that appear to me at all likely to render the continuance of these chiefs in the power they enjoy within their respective limits, safe and useful either to their prince or the British Government, and among other points to which I have directed his attention is that of bringing near his person some of their near relations and adherents which they will gladly maintain under the impression of its being the means of acquiring influence and favour. It will also be valued as giving them the opportunity of stating any of their petty grievances or wants and it will add to their local importance. Such are the advantages it offers them. To us it gives a gradual increase, unattended with expense, to a small body of Irregular Horse, natives of Cutch. It furnishes the best of channels through which we can convey advice or in any way promote improvement. We become through such daily intercourse intelligible to rude men and obtain a confidence which prevents incalculable evils, for I am positive nine out of ten of the risings and rebellions we have had to suppress in India have their origin in the ignorance and dread of those who have had no opportunities of acquiring information of our views or intentions\u2014much less of forming any idea of the principles of a Government so totally different to those to which they and their ancestors have been accustomed.\n\n40. Success in imparting this knowledge, as it tends to make confidence supplant fear, will maintain the public peace better than armies, and in countries like Cutch or Kathiawar (I speak from ample experience of a similar community in Malwa), there is no means so adapted to gain these ends as the Resident having near his person or with those officers he employs, the sons, brothers and relations of the chiefs of the country and particularly when they are young and disposed to receive instruction; such persons, if kindly treated and no duties they dislike are exacted from them, and above all if they are at first allowed to go to their homes at pleasure, will soon become a link not only of establishing confidence but of giving to the British representative a place in the regard of all branches of the family to which they belong. They may occasionally carry from him some small present to a mother or mark of notice to a father or uncle who has behaved well and a favour will be estimated at ten times its value from being received through such a channel.\n\n41. This mode of conciliation and of promoting friendship as well as of reforming ignorant and barbarous men requires no doubt patience, kindness, humanity and judgment, but these qualities we have a right to expect in the Agents selected for high and delicate duties, and I must state my conviction that the mode of conciliation I have noticed, may be applied (modified of course by local circumstances) to every part of our wide territories that contains uncivilized and ignorant chiefs and tribes, and that where the Agent has a fair latitude given to him and is competent to his duties he will effect more through such means in restoring or maintaining peace in the country under his management or control than through any others he can employ, but he must neither be deterred by partial failures nor slow progress from perseverance in an object which, when once obtained, fixes the foundation of our influence and power on a hundredfold better foundation than ever can be effected by force, for it rests upon willing obedience and confidence on one part and a recognition of rights on the other; while force, if successful, stifles\nwithout extinguishing, a spirit of hostility, and in compelling us to sequester rights that have been under all vicissitudes retained for ages, causes too often a harassing and expensive warfare. The latter result is, I regret to state, too frequent in our history, the measures by which it has been produced may stand apparently justified on our records, but they will be found contrary to the usage of the best of the former rulers of India and at variance with true policy in our present state of power. When that was more limited and of a more doubtful character self-defence compelled us to many acts which we should now avoid. Every means should now be used to save us from the necessity of alienating the property or destroying the right of any one subject to our sway, and when we act with a full impression of the value of this policy we shall find that a great proportion of those on whom our rigid rules precipitate punishment err more from want of knowledge of the rules and principles of our administration and ignorance of our objects than from any design of placing themselves in opposition or hostility to a Government whose power at this moment is far too great to admit of their entertaining any hope of successful resistance to its authority.\n\n42. The Ran between Cutch and K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r is no defence whatever; for it is not above twelve miles at M\u00e1lia where it can be crossed in two or three hours during nine months\\(^1\\) of the year and a corps or body of horse leaving V\u00e1gad, the most fruitful district of Cutch, would, in twenty miles distance, reach the finest part of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r; but the Ran between Cutch and Sind is a considerable, though not an insurmountable obstacle against the invasion of any troops except predatory horse. This fact, the extension of the territories of Cutch to Lakhpat and its immediate proximity to the delta of the Indus give it increased value as a military position at a period when the two great Asiatic Powers, Persia and Turkey, are no longer the formidable barriers they once were considered against the approach of a European enemy to the vicinity of our Eastern possessions, but this is a subject I shall not anticipate as I intend very early to lay before the Board a memoir which will contain all the information I possess regarding the line of our Western Frontiers from Lakhpat bandar to Jesalmer, and the means which a European enemy would have of attacking it as well as those we possess of defence. At present I shall limit my observation on this point to the conclusion that if our pledged faith permitted us to abandon our connection with Cutch, it would be most impolitic to do so.\n\n43. We are not to suppose that in resigning our power in this country it would fall back into that state in which we found it. Our connection has given it comparative tranquillity, but it has had the effect of diminishing by this very result its power of resisting those foreign inroads to which it has always been exposed. I cannot have the least doubt that disarmed in a manner as it has been by our having so long had the charge of its defence it would fall an easy conquest to Sind and it could not have a fate more injurious to our interests if ever a European enemy was in possession of the Indus, for we must either outrage Sind by re-occupying this country on the approach of an invader, or abandon one of the most important outworks to the defence of this part of India and the one beyond all others most likely to deter the rulers of Sind from forming a.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The sea is forced up during the S. W. monsoon and renders it impassable at this place in July, August and September, but it may be crossed higher up, though broader.\nconnection with our enemies as its vicinity to the mouths of the Indus to Tatta and the port of Kurrachee would give us the greatest facilities in destroying their trade or in invading their territories.\n\n44. Circumstances precluding, as I conceive they do, all idea of abandoning the connection with Cutch, it remains only to determine what is the best mode of maintaining it in order that we may fix, as the Secret Committee desire, what line of policy we mean under all changes to pursue, and also to decide on that which is most economical and which will prevent the connection with this petty state being burdensome on our finances.\n\n45. If ever obliged by the conduct of the prince or his chiefs to interfere more directly than we now do in the affairs of Cutch, or if existing ties were by any circumstances dissolved, we may either take under our direct management the whole of the country, or partially occupy that portion of it which was best suited to our purposes; the former would be decidedly the best course, as it would effect at once, what the other must early lead to with increased expense and embarrassment, but under no circumstances would I recommend the introduction of our civil administration into Cutch. If obliged, which I trust we shall not be, to assume openly the administration of its affairs, it must still be viewed more as a military outwork which necessity compelled us to occupy than a part of our settled provinces. One of the present family of princes to which the people are singularly attached should be nominal ruler, and those chiefs who had not forfeited every claim to consideration should be preserved in power. This small country should be managed by natives under the supervision of a Resident. The introduction of our laws and regulations would create a jealousy and alarm not only in Cutch but the neighbouring countries of Sind, Baluchistan and Multan, while the mode of management I have suggested would be no more than what the inhabitants of these uncivilized countries are accustomed to; for its rulers have often been pageants in the hands of foreigners, and they must think (nor are they far from the fact) that we at this moment exercise, upon occasion, almost as absolute a power as if we were its direct administrators.\n\n46. In expressing my opinion that our civil government should not eventually even be extended to Cutch, I do not mean to draw any comparison between its excellence and that which I propose should on an emergency occurring be adopted in that country, but I deem Cutch only valuable as a position of defence on this part of our frontier, and I recommend that system which I deem best calculated to promote the end for which alone it is occupied; and that end, I conceive, to be of a magnitude that must supersede all minor considerations and the question is of a nature that separates it from those that relate to the administration of other parts of the territories of this Presidency.\n\n47. The diminution of the force stationed in Cutch is in progress. I shall hereafter give a statement of the actual difference of expense made by removal of corps and reduction of establishments in that country. It will be sufficient at present to give the results.\n\n48. In January 1830, the disbursements in Cutch including all charges, political and military, were Rs. 6,39,360 per annum. By various reforms and the removal of a native regiment to another quarter of the country where it was much required, they have been reduced to Rs. 3,94,700 and will be further reduced about Rs. 40,000 by the recent order striking off field allowances, and the whole connection therefore cannot be estimated at\na higher annual cost than about Rs. 70,000 being the difference between our disbursements and two *lakhs* and eighty-eight thousand rupees which we receive from the R\u00e1o as subsidy and compensation for Anj\u00e1r.\n\n49. Though the present Political Resident Lieutenant-Colonel Pottinger receives in amount under different heads his former salary, his successor will have no more than Rs. 1200 per mensem with his military allowance, which is in fact only Rs. 600 more than any officer would receive in the military command he exercises; and as his assistant has the reduced salary of Rs. 400, the whole political duty of this Residency is at a charge of only Rs. 1000 per mensem, but independent of the great saving which results from this combination of military and political duties in Cutch it appears to me quite essential on other grounds.\n\n50. The Resident of Cutch may be viewed under the present system as \u2018Warder of the Border\u2019 from the Indus to near Deesa; and upon his judgment and decision both in forming and executing his plans on emergency occurring, the peace of both Cutch and K\u00e1thi\u00e1war may in a great degree depend. Viewing these duties as I do, I am quite satisfied that the military and political authority should continue to be combined in one individual, and that, independent of the saving of expense from this arrangement which is very considerable, it is calculated to promote the public interests, both as it increases the local impression of the power of the public officer who fills the station, and as it avoids all hazard of those delays and embarrassments which often result from difference of opinion and the collision of civil and military officers employed at a distance from the seat of government.\n\nI request copies of this minute may be sent by the earliest opportunity to the Court of Directors and the Supreme Government.\n\n---\n\n1 This allows between five and six thousand rupees, occasional *bh\u00e1ta* to sepoys employed on detachment.\nP\u00c1LANPUR.\nP\u00c1LANPUR.\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nDESCRIPTION.\n\nThe district under the P\u00e1lanpur Political Superintendent, lying between 24\u00b0 41' and 23\u00b0 25' north latitude, and 72\u00b0 46' and 71\u00b0 16' east longitude, has a total estimated area of about 8000 square miles, a population of about 500,000 souls or 62\u00bd to the square mile, and an estimated yearly revenue of about \u00a3120,000 (Rs. 12,00,000).\n\nSituated in the north-west of Guj\u00e1r\u00e1t to the east of Cutch, the district is bounded on the north by M\u00e1rv\u00e1r and Sirohi, on the east by the Mahi K\u00e1ntha, on the south by the territory of His Highness the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r and by K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, and on the west by the Ran of Cutch.\n\nThe Superintendency includes a group of thirteen states, of which four, P\u00e1lanpur, R\u00e1dhanpur, V\u00e1r\u00e1hi, and Terv\u00e1da, are under Musalm\u00e1n chiefs; seven, Thar\u00e1d, Morv\u00e1da, V\u00e1v, Suig\u00e1m, Diodar, S\u00e1ntalpur, and Ch\u00e1dchat, under Rajputs; and two, Bh\u00e1bar and K\u00e1nkrej, under Koli Th\u00e1kard\u00e1s of part Rajput origin. Two of the whole number, P\u00e1lanpur, with an area of about 2384 square miles, and a population of about 215,000 souls, and R\u00e1dhanpur, with an area of about 929 square miles, and a population of about 90,000 souls, rank as first class states. The remaining eleven are petty states, with an average population of about 20,000 souls, and an average yearly revenue estimated at about \u00a33000 (Rs. 30,000).\n\nAs a whole the district is a sandy plain with, in some places, waving sandhills and between them valleys of black clay. Near P\u00e1lanpur and to the eastward the country is undulating and well-wooded; to the north and north-east where it borders on Sirohi it is extremely difficult, most wild and picturesque, covered with rocks and forest-clad hill ranges, outliers from the \u00c1bu and J\u00e1sor hills. West towards the Ran and south to Jhinjhuv\u00e1da, and thence round to the east is one sandy plain, slightly wooded in the centre, but treeless both in the north and south and towards the west gradually falling away into a salt waste. This part of the country seems to have been greatly changed since 1830, when, according to Sir A. Burnes, there was no town or place of any size on the banks of the Ran, and few places were more wild and deserted than its neighbourhood. The country was in no way cleared and abounded in lions and tigers, and the greatest caution was required in travelling from village to village.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Sir A. Burnes. MS. 1st April 1828.\nIn the north-east of the district are some hills of considerable height, outliers from the \u00c1r\u00e1vali range. Of these the chief is J\u00e1sor, about eighteen miles north of P\u00e1lanpur, a hill of gneiss with outbursts of granite. This, about 3500 feet high, is a long hogbacked mountain, except that its water supply is scanty, well suited for a sanitarium. The top can, at present, be reached only by men on foot, but a path for horsemen could, without much difficulty, be made. The whole hill is covered with thick forest, on the top chiefly bamboos. All the year round in three or four gorges small pools of water are found. The other chief hills are, beginning a mile to the south of the J\u00e1sor range and stretching eastward, the Chiklodar M\u00e1ta\u2019s hill, taking its name from a small shrine on the highest peak that rises about 2500 feet above the sea. Near Karimabad is another hill of about equal height. Both are covered with thick forest. The conical hill, called the R\u00e1ni Tunk or the Queen\u2019s Peak, at the western end of the Surbakri hills and about a mile and a half from the town of Dantiv\u00e1da, is a marked feature in the Deesa landscape. Near its foot is the site of the ruined city of Dh\u00e1r\u00e1pur and the Dh\u00e1r\u00e1sar lake.\n\n1 Of this hill the following story is told: Chandan Soda, chief of Nagar P\u00e1rkar, one day riding in a village on the north shore of the Ran, started a noble boar. The boar made for the Ran, and pursued for a day and a moon-light night, was at last speared on the V\u00e1gad side of the Ran close to the walls of Kel\u00e1kot, the capital of L\u00e1kha Phul\u00e1n\u00ed, the great king of the west. Hearing that a stranger had, without leave, speared a boar under his castle walls and ridden off without explanation or apology, L\u00e1kha Phul\u00e1n\u00ed and some of his men started in pursuit. When they came up to him, Chandan tried to explain that he had chased the boar right across the Ran from P\u00e1rkar. At first L\u00e1kha would not believe, but was at last convinced by the millet ears and melons found in the boar\u2019s stomach. Taking Chandan back with him, he agreed to give him his daughter in marriage, promising to tell him when the lucky day should come. Chandan on this went home. But the people of L\u00e1kha\u2019s house, thinking the stranger no fit match for a daughter of their family, settled that the king\u2019s promise should be kept, but that Chandan should not be told to come till so near the marriage day, that no time would be left for his journey. After a time a messenger was sent; his journey being so arranged that he should not reach P\u00e1rkar till the day before the marriage day. On hearing L\u00e1kha\u2019s message, Chandan, sad at heart, went round his people, but there was no horse or camel that could travel in one day to Kel\u00e1kot. All seemed lost when a carpenter offered a pair of tame nilg\u00e1is, and yoking them to a carriage drove Chandan across the Ran. Reaching Kel\u00e1kot early in the morning of the marriage day, the bride\u2019s family could raise no further objection and the marriage was duly completed. Questioning Chandan about his journey the king heard of the nilg\u00e1is, and determining to get hold of them accused the carpenter of committing adultery with one of the late king\u2019s widows, and put him in prison. Enraged at the king for disgracing her, the dowager queen arranged to run away with the carpenter, and, by the help of the nilg\u00e1is they escaped in safety. They took with them the queen\u2019s daughter by a former husband and settled at a village called Dh\u00e1r\u00e1pur. After ten years, M\u00e1r\u00fa, the queen\u2019s daughter, growing to womanhood, was wed to a young Solanki named Viramji. An angry lover, Devr\u00e1j, a young Rab\u00e1ri, went in his rage to the court of Soda Sumra ruler of Amarkot, and so inflamed his mind with tales of M\u00e1r\u00fa\u2019s beauty, that he sent his brother and a party of horse, and brought her by force to his palace. Sending word to M\u00e1r\u00fa that he was coming to visit her, M\u00e1r\u00fa told him that she had taken an oath not to see a man for six months, and that if he waited till the six months were over, she would then gladly receive his visit. To this Soda Sumra agreed. M\u00e1r\u00fa then wrote to Viramji: \u201cFor five months my vow keeps me safe; come quickly with a good camel, then I will join you, and we will flee together. If you do not come, I will die, I will never receive the R\u00e1ja as my lover.\u201d With the finest camel he could buy, Viramji reached Amarkot, and letting M\u00e1r\u00fa know that he had come, stayed in the market for some months. At last, when six months had passed, M\u00e1r\u00fa sent a message to Soda Sumra, asking him, as the time was over, to send her a camel that she might ride on it and be freed from her vow.\nThe two chief rivers are the Ban\u00e1s and the Sarasvati, also called Kum\u00e1rika.\n\nThe Ban\u00e1s rising in Dhebar lake among the Udepur hills, flows west, past the flourishing town and cantonment of Deesa, and falls into the Ran of Cutch by two mouths near Gokh\u00e1tar in V\u00e1r\u00e1hi and Ag\u00edch\u00e1na in S\u00e1ntalpur. Entering P\u00e1l\u00e1npur to the north-east of Sarota, it passes for about twelve miles through thick forest, and for about eight miles more has rocky banks and a rocky bed. West of this both banks and bed are sandy, and during the hot weather the stream ceases to flow. Towards \u00c1bu its channel is 300 yards wide, six miles above Deesa a mile, at Deesa 700 yards, and at R\u00e1dhanpur 400. At Deesa, and a few miles above and below, it is a running stream all the year round.\\(^1\\) Floods in the Ban\u00e1s, as it is the only drainage line from \u00c1bu, often bring down a very great volume of water, covering the Ran eight miles from shore to shore, sometimes with from six to eight feet of fresh water.\\(^2\\) Except when in flood, the Ban\u00e1s may almost everywhere be forded. Its chief tributaries are the Sipu and the B\u00e1l\u00e1ram. The Sipu, rising to the east of the Nim\u00e1j hills in the Sirohi district, joins the Ban\u00e1s near Bharath and Chhota R\u00e1npur in P\u00e1l\u00e1npur. The B\u00e1l\u00e1ram rises in the hills on the north-east frontier, and flowing by the shrine of B\u00e1l\u00e1ram, whence it takes its name, joins the Ban\u00e1s near Karja in P\u00e1l\u00e1npur. There are no tides in the Ban\u00e1s, and its stream is too shallow for boats. It is not used for irrigation, though by building dams much of the flood water might be stored.\n\nThe Sarasvati, a small but very holy stream, rises in the Mahi K\u00e1ntha hills, and crossing the south-east corner of P\u00e1l\u00e1npur, passes by Sidhpur and P\u00e1tan. A few miles below P\u00e1tan it flows underground for some miles, and again rising to the light passes through R\u00e1dhanpur, and flowing almost parallel with the Ban\u00e1s, enters the Ran a few miles to the south of Anvarpur. Except in the rains the Sarasvati has a very small flow to the west of P\u00e1tan, and may almost everywhere be forded. Throughout its course it has a sandy bed and banks, and is everywhere too shallow for boats. Besides these rivers many smaller streams add much to the richness of the country.\n\nThe district contains no natural lakes, but, especially in R\u00e1dhanpur, has many ponds. Close to the hills the water is very near the surface, but gradually sinks in the sandy western plains. In P\u00e1l\u00e1npur, the depth varies from forty to fifty feet, while in some\n\n---\n\nAnxious to please her, Sumra sent all the camels in the town. M\u00e1ru examined them, and choosing Viramji's mounted it, and, saying she would ride round the fort, moved away. Out of sight they took the Dh\u00e1r\u00e1pur road, and, though pursued by Sumra, made good their escape. Enraged at being outwitted, Sumra called together his troops and advanced against Dh\u00e1r\u00e1pur. Unable to resist him, Dh\u00e1ra S\u00fat\u00e1r, Viram Solanki, and the two R\u00e1mis, Jalku and M\u00e1ru, fled with a few followers to the Surbakti hills. Pursued to the hills they were attacked and defeated, and Dh\u00e1ra S\u00fat\u00e1r and Viram Solanki slain. Their fortunes hopeless, Jalku and M\u00e1ru withdrew to the top of the furthest peak, and, dreading capture more than death, threw themselves over the cliff. Since then this has been known as the 'Queen's Peak'. Ind. Ant. II. 339.\n\n\\(^1\\) Sir A. Burnes. MS. 1st April 1828.\n\\(^2\\) Sir A. Burnes. MS. 1st April 1828.\nparts of Thar\u00e1d it is as much as 120. Within the last few years the water-level is said to have sunk to twice its former depth. Towards the Ran, water is specially scarce and brackish, and, in this part of the district, a scanty rainfall causes the greatest hardship. The water of the rivers, fresh and good in the east, on entering R\u00e1dhanpur, is, except when in flood, too salt for drinking or other use.\n\nExcept in hollows where it is clay, and near the Ran where it is mixed with black earth, the soil of the plain country is sandy. The rocks are metamorphic, gneiss and mica-schist, with upheavals and outbursts of red and grey granite.\n\nThe year has four seasons, hot and dry, rainy, hot and moist, and cold; the first lasts through March, April, May, and June; the second, through July and August; the third, through September, October, and part of November; and the fourth, through part of November, December, January, and February. In the hot and dry season, the heat, even in the P\u00e1l\u00e1npur territory, is great; and in the north towards M\u00e1rw\u00e1r, and in the west towards the Ran, it is intense. The thermometer rises to 120\u00b0 in the shade, and the hot winds are so fierce as to keep even the people of the country from travelling during the day time. Especially away from the hills and near the Ran, the rains are slight. The third season, September, October, and November, is very unhealthy. Both Europeans and natives suffer from fevers of a bad type. The fourth season is pleasant, and for Europeans, healthy, the cold, especially towards the Ran, being at times very great. But the cold does not last long, and scarcely a month passes without some hot days. The total fall of rain at P\u00e1l\u00e1npur was, in 1872, 28\u00b76 inches; in 1873, 21\u00b78 inches; in 1874, 35\u00b744 inches; in 1875, 34\u00b773 inches; in 1876, 26 inches; and in 1877, 14\u00b779 inches.\u00b9 In 1878, the mean temperature was in January, 69\u00b76; in May, 91\u00b74; in September, 86; and in December, 69\u00b77.\n\n\u00b9 Since 1876, besides at P\u00e1l\u00e1npur, rain gauges have been kept at Thar\u00e1d and S\u00e1ntalpur. The total rainfall at these two places was in 1876, 19\u00b744 inches at Thar\u00e1d and 17\u00b719 inches at S\u00e1ntalpur; and in 1877, 5\u00b731 inches at Thar\u00e1d and 7\u00b735 inches at S\u00e1ntalpur.\nCHAPTER II.\n\nPRODUCTION.\n\nThere is no limestone in strata, but small lime nodules are found at from ten to sixty, or even eighty feet below the surface. Mountain limestone is found in some places, but it does not seem fit for working on any large scale. There is a small limestone quarry at Ch\u00e1ranka under S\u00e1ntalpur, where it is sold at 18s. 8d. the ton (6 mans the rupee). Granite of good quality is also found, but so far from roads that it is never quarried. Gneiss and other metamorphic rock is used only near the hills, and almost all the building stone of the district comes from the Dhr\u00e1ngadra quarries in K\u00e1thi\u00e1war. A coarse marble found at P\u00e1nsv\u00e1l, D\u00e1bhela, R\u00e1mpura, and Juni V\u00e1vdi is quarried, and sold at 18s. 8d. the ton (6 mans the rupee).\n\nThe chief trees in the district are: Of FRUIT trees, the Bel, bili, \u00c6gle marmelos; the mhowa, mahuda, Bassia latifolia; the timru or timbarva, Diospyros montana; the \u00e1mla or \u00e1vla, Phyllanthus emblica; the j\u00e1mbu, Eugenia jambolana; the wood apple, kothi or kothi, Feronia elephantum; the mango, \u00e1mbu, Mangifera indica; the r\u00e1n or r\u00e1yan, Mimusops indica; the tamarind, \u00e1mli, Tamarindus indica; and the jujube, bordi, Zizyphus jujuba. Of TIMBER trees, the Babul, b\u00e1val, Acacia arabica; the blackwood, sisam, Dalbergia sissoo; the khijro, Prosopis spicigera; and the arjan or s\u00e1dado, Terminalia arjuna. Of SHADE trees, the aduso, Ailanthus excelsa; the nim or limbo, Melia azadirachta; the gundi, Cordia rothii; the gular or umbarda, Ficus glomerata; the vad, Ficus bengalensis; the piplo, Ficus religiosa; the pipad, Ficus tsicla; the karanj, Pongamia glabra; and the kad\u00e1i, Sterculia urens. Of FLOWERING trees, the simla, Bombax malabaricum; the garm\u00e1la, Cassia fistula; the g\u00e1rgio kh\u00e1kho, Erythrina suberosa; the champa, Michelia champaca; the borsali, Mimusops elengi; and the alri, Morinda exserta. Of MISCELLANEOUS trees, the catechu, kher, Acacia catechu; the hormo, Acacia leucophloea; the ekal k\u00e1nta, Alangium lamarkii; the singoria, Balanites roxburghii; the kachn\u00e1r, Bauhinia purpurea; the asundra, Bauhinia racemosa; the revra, Bignonia undulata; the s\u00e1lar or s\u00e1lera, Boswellia thurifera; the bastard teak, kh\u00e1kho, Butea frondosa; the pardesi, Erythrina indica; the dh\u00f3man, Gremia asiatica; the saragvo, Moringa pterigosperma; the kalam, Stopheyne parvifolia; the marda shenga, Randia dumetorum; the jalor pilvu, Salvadora indica; the arithi, Sapindus emarginatus; the rohan, Soymida febrifuga; the amb\u00e1da, Spondias mangifera; the dudla, Springa emodi; the bastard cypress, Tamarix indica; the beheda, Terminalia belerica; the bang\u00e1li bad\u00e1m, Terminalia catappa; and the p\u00e1raspiplo, Thespesia populnea.\nThe large forests in the north and north-east of the P\u00e1l\u00e1npur districts, though at present of little value, might, if well managed, yield a considerable revenue. The Bhils and Kolis gather bees' wax, gum, honey, and the pods of the Cassia fistula, garm\u00e1la, and sell them to V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s or Momans who dispose of them in the larger towns. A considerable number of cattle are pastured in these forests and still more in the valley of the Ban\u00e1s. The bamboo woods are in places very fine, especially on the top of the J\u00e1sor hill.\n\nThe oxen of the K\u00e1nkraj, V\u00e1v, and Thar\u00e1d states are considered better than those of any other part of the Superintendency, and all over Gujar\u00e1t are found in the stables of the wealthy. They are fine, strong, well-built animals, of good height, and in colour generally white, muzda. They are bred by cultivators and Rab\u00e1ri herdsmen, from two kinds of bulls known as the p\u00e1lel and the \u00e1khlo. They are put to work at three years of age. One pair of bullocks can plough, work a well, and, in hard soil, draw a wagon-load of nearly half a ton (30 mans). In sandy tracts a pair of bullocks can draw a cart-load of more than a third of a ton (20 mans), but for the larger wagons two or three pairs are wanted. Except during the rains when they are taken to graze in the grass lands, b\u00edv, oxen are generally stall-fed. They get grass or millet straw, kadbi, pulse, guv\u00e1r and math, and oil-cake, khol, cotton-seed, kap\u00e1sia, and sometimes butter or molasses. They are seldom fed on grain. In the cold season, or when tired or sick, they have some special dainty, mas\u00e1la, given them. A p\u00e1lel bull, s\u00e1ndh, is worth from \u00a32 10s. to \u00a34 (Rs. 25 - 40), and an \u00e1khlo bull from \u00a32 to \u00a33 (Rs. 20 - 30). The price of a pair of oxen ranges from \u00a310 to \u00a330 (Rs. 100 - 300). P\u00e1lel bulls and oxen are prized and well cared for; others are left to roam where they will with the village cattle, and pick up what they can.\n\nCows calve in their third or fourth year, and give from two to six pounds of milk, morning and evening, from six months to a year at a time. They give milk up to their fourteenth or fifteenth year. Towns-people make over their calves to cultivators or to Rab\u00e1ri and Sindi herdsmen, to be reared and given back when full grown. The price of the calf is fixed, and when full grown and returned it is again valued by a committee, panch, the herdsman getting one-half of the increase. If a calf dies in the rearer's hands, he has to pay the owner one-half of its original price. The rearer may, if he wishes, keep the animal, paying the owner the original price and one-half of its additional value. A cow varies in price from \u00a31 to \u00a35 (Rs. 10 - 50). Milch cows are fed on oil-cakes, khol, cotton-seed, kap\u00e1sia, or pulse, guv\u00e1r. The monthly cost of a cow's keep varies from 10s. to \u00a31 (Rs. 5 - 10).\n\nFemale buffaloes usually calve in their fourth or fifth year, and give from four to ten pounds of milk, morning and evening, from six months to one year at a time. They give over bearing at fifteen or sixteen. A herdsman's terms for rearing a buffalo are the same as for rearing a cow. The value of a female buffalo varies from \u00a33 to \u00a310 (Rs. 30 - 100). They are fed on oil-cake, khol, cotton-seed, kap\u00e1sia, and pulse, guv\u00e1r. The monthly cost of a buffalo's keep comes to from \u00a31 4s. to \u00a32 10s. (Rs. 12 - 25).\nMale buffaloes, *p\u00e1d\u00e1s*, are used for breeding, and sometimes for carrying water-bags, *pakh\u00e1s*, and ploughing. Buffaloes are generally bred by cultivators and Sindis, who put them to work in their fourth or fifth year. The price of a male buffalo varies from \u00a31 to \u00a34 (Rs. 10 - 40).\n\nSheep, generally white or white and black, are bred by Rab\u00e1ri herdsmen, who sell the wool, milk, and butter. They are sheared once a year at the close of the cold season, and the wool is woven into blankets or sold to traders. The price of a sheep varies from 4s. to 8s. (Rs. 2 - 4). Among Musalm\u00e1ns, rams are reared, and trained to fight.\n\nGoats, white, brown, black, and of mixed colour, are bred both by cultivators and by Rab\u00e1ris. They are of two kinds, the small common goat known as *matini*, and the large Rab\u00e1ri goat known as *bakri*. The milk or butter is sold, and the hair woven into blankets or sold to traders. The price of a goat varies from 2s. to 6s. (Re. 1 - 3).\n\nCamels are reared by landholders and by Rab\u00e1ri and Sindi herdsmen. They are used both for riding and baggage. Inferior to those of Thar in Sind and Bik\u00e1n\u00edr in Rajput\u00e1na, their value ranges from \u00a33 to \u00a310 (Rs. 30 - 100). They are usually fed on pulse, *guv\u00e1r*, and the leaves of the *lim* or *nimb*, *Melia azadirachta*, tree. When tired, they sometimes get molasses, *gol*, salt and alum. The monthly cost of a camel\u2019s keep varies from 10s. to \u00a31 10s. (Rs. 5 - 15).\n\nHorses are bred in these parts by large landlords, *T\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs* and *J\u00e1gird\u00e1rs* and by well-to-do cultivators. They cost to buy from \u00a33 to \u00a330 (Rs. 30 - 300), and the monthly cost of their keep is from \u00a31 to \u00a32 (Rs. 10 - 20). They are fed on grass, Indian millet, and pulse, gram or *math*, and, as a condiment, butter, *ghi*, in the hot season; molasses, *gol*, in the rains; and spices, *mas\u00e1la*, in the cold weather. Because they are more teachable, *T\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs* generally ride mares, and, except one or two specially good ones set apart for breeding, either sell or hand over their horses to their attendants. A gelding is very seldom seen.\n\nR\u00e1vals, grain-carriers, and Kumbh\u00e1rs, potters, rear asses and use them as beasts of burden. An ass costs to buy from \u00a31 to \u00a31 10s. (Rs. 10 - 15) and for its millet, *b\u00e1jri*, and pulse, *math*, about 6s. (Rs. 3) a month.\n\nHens are of two breeds, the *kulang*, a large and handsome, and the *phetial*, a smaller and meaner bird. The price of a hen varies from 6d. to 1s. 6d. (4 - 12 as.), and that of an egg from \u00bdd. to \u00bed. (3 - 6 pies). They are bred by V\u00e1ghris and Musalm\u00e1ns. Ducks, varying in price from 12s. to \u00a31 4s. (Rs. 6 - 12) a dozen, are reared only by V\u00e1ghris in the Deesa camp.\n\nTurkeys, Pea-fowl, and Guinea-fowl are not reared for sale. For Turkeys and Guinea-fowl Ahmedabad is the nearest market. Pea-fowl are plentiful, but, as the people hold them sacred, their slaughter is forbidden.\nOf Wild Animals, the Lion, sahi, is now very rare. The other beasts of prey are the Tiger, v\u00e1gh, Felis tigris; the Panther, dipdo, Felis leopardus; the Bear, rinchh, Ursus labiatus; the hunting Fard, chita, Felis jubata; the Hy\u00e6na, tarachh, Hy\u00e6na striata; and the Wolf, varu, Canis pallipes. Of Deer, there are the Stag, s\u00e1bar, Rusa aristotelis, the Spotted Deer, chital, Axis maculatus; the Antelope, k\u00e1l\u00ed\u00e1r, Antelope bezoartica; the Ravine Deer, but\u00e1r; the Blue Bull, nilg\u00e1i, Portax pictus; the Indian Gazelle, chik\u00e1ra, Gazella benettii; the Wild Boar, suvar, Sus indicus; and the Hare, sastu, Lepus ruficandatus, are also found in the district. The average yearly number of deaths from wild beasts is about four, and from snake-bites about twenty.\n\nThe district abounds in woodland and water fowl, and is specially rich in the variety of its wild duck. The other game birds are Florican, karimor, Sypheotides auritus; Bustard, gor\u00e1l, Eupodotis edwardsii; Partridges, titar, of two kinds, the Painted, Francolinus pictus, and the Grey, Ortygornis pondiceriana; Quails, l\u00e1vri, of two kinds, the Grey, Coturnix communis, and the Rain, Coturnix coromandelica; Snipe, snap, of three kinds, the common, Gallinago scolopacinus, the Jack, Gallinago gallinula, and the Painted, Rhynchoea bengalensis; Wild Geese, jangli hans, and three kinds of Sand Grouse, bat\u00e1bat, the large or Ran Grouse, Pterocles senegallus, the Common, Pterocles exustus, and the Painted, Pterocles fasciatus, are also met with. Pelicans, chamcha, are not uncommon.\n\nThe chief fish are the maral, the padia, the dhebar, the eel, the b\u00e1m, and the sing\u00e1ra.\nCHAPTER III.\n\nPOPULATION.\n\nIn 1867-68 a very rough numbering of the people was made. The returns shewed 213,382 males and 185,753 females, total 399,135; adding to this 9335 for the Deesa camp, it gave a total return for the whole superintendency of 408,470 souls or 67\u00b759 to the square mile. That these returns were very imperfect was shown by the 1872 census which gave an increase of 94,110, the total rising to 502,586 souls, or 62\u00b782 to the square mile. Of the total number 455,892 were Hindus 32,956 of them Jains, 46,678 were Musalmans, and 16 were brought under the head 'Others.' Of the total population 263,791 were males and 238,795 females, the percentage of males on the total population being 52\u00b749 and of females 47\u00b751. Hindu males numbered 221,786 or 52\u00b744 per cent, and Hindu females 201,150 or 47\u00b756 per cent of the total Hindu population; Musalm\u00e1n males numbered 24,791 or 53\u00b711 per cent, and Musalm\u00e1n females 21,887 or 46\u00b789 per cent of the total Musalm\u00e1n population; under the head 'Others' males numbered 10 or 62\u00b750 per cent, and females 6 or 37\u00b750 per cent of the total.\n\nThe following are the chief available caste and race details. Among Hindus, Br\u00e1hmans have five principal divisions, Shrim\u00e1li, Audich, Modh, P\u00e1liv\u00e1l, and S\u00e1rasvat. Most of these earn their living as priests. Of the rest, some are endowed with land; some are in the service of chiefs as readers of religious books and astrologers, and a few are traders and cultivators. Br\u00e1hmans are numerous, especially in towns, and are rarely poor.\n\nUnder the head Writers come Brahma-Kshatris, a small well-to-do class generally clerks or pleaders, mukhi\u00e1rs.\n\nUnder the head Merchants, Traders, and Shopkeepers come V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, Loh\u00e1n\u00e1s, and Bh\u00e1t\u00ed\u00e1s. Of V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s there are nine chief divisions, Shrim\u00e1li, Modh, Kapol, Osv\u00e1l, Porv\u00e1d, Jh\u00e1lora, P\u00e1ncha, L\u00e1d, and Leta. The V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, a very large class, are employed as agents and managers by large landholders and engage in trade. As a class they are wealthy. The Loh\u00e1n\u00e1s, generally shopkeepers and clerks, are few and poor. The Bh\u00e1t\u00ed\u00e1s, who are all traders, are few but wealthy.\n\nUnder the head Husbandmen come six classes, Rajputs, Koli Th\u00e1kard\u00e1s, Kanbis, Sathv\u00e1r\u00e1s, Narod\u00e1s, and Kolis. The Rajputs, a very large class, belong to seven leading divisions; Ch\u00e1vda, Choh\u00e1n, R\u00e1thod, Solanki, Parm\u00e1r, Y\u00e1dav and Gohil, and are chiefly land-owners, village sharers, v\u00e1nt\u00e1d\u00e1rs, and holders of service land,\npas\u00e1ita. Their position and wealth varies, but as a class they are in debt. The Koli Th\u00e1kard\u00e1s are fairly numerous and are divided into eight leading classes, Solanki, R\u00e1thod, Choh\u00e1n, Parm\u00e1r, Bhatesria, D\u00e1bhi, Arniv\u00e1ria, and Khamboia. These differ from common Kol\u00eds in having a strain of Rajput blood. They are generally landholders and are more or less indebted and allied with the predatory classes. Kanbis with three chief divisions, Leva, Kadva, and \u00c1nja are found only in moderate numbers. As a class they are well-to-do. The Sathv\u00e1r\u00e1s, market gardeners and cultivators, are few and in good circumstances. The N\u00e1rod\u00e1s are fairly numerous and well-to-do. The Kol\u00eds form the bulk of the people and are poor. They are daring thieves and highway robbers, and are much given to cattle-stealing.\n\nCraftsmen.\n\nOf Manufacturers there are three classes, Khatris and S\u00e1lvis, weavers, and Bh\u00e1vs\u00e1s, calico-printers. These are few in number and except the S\u00e1lvis are well-to-do. Of Artisans there are seven classes; Sonis, gold and silver smiths; Suth\u00e1rs, carpenters; Kans\u00e1ras, coppersmiths; Sal\u00e1ts, masons; Luh\u00e1rs, blacksmiths; Darjis, tailors; and Kumbh\u00e1rs, potters. These are few and except the last well-to-do.\n\nPlayers.\n\nOf Bards and Actors there are three classes; Bhav\u00e1y\u00e1s, strolling comedians, few and poor; Ch\u00e1rans, genealogists and cattle graziers, fairly numerous and poor; and Bh\u00e1ts, bards, few but well-to-do.\n\nServants.\n\nOf Personal Servants there are four classes; Dhobbis, washermen; Su\u00e1rs, Rajput cooks; V\u00e1l\u00e1ns, barbers; and Khav\u00e1s, domestic servants. These are fairly numerous; the Su\u00e1rs, M\u00e1rw\u00e1r barbers and cooks, seldom used in the Mahi K\u00e1ntha, and V\u00e1l\u00e1ns are in poor circumstances. The Khav\u00e1s, children of slave girls, originally domestic slaves are now hereditary domestic servants.\n\nShepherds.\n\nOf Herdsmen and Shepherds there are three classes: Rab\u00e1ris, cattle graziers; Bharv\u00e1ds, shepherds; and \u00c1hirs, herdsmen. The \u00c1hirs are found only in S\u00e1ntalpur. Cultivators by profession, they are strong-built and generally well-to-do. In dress and other particulars they resemble Kanbis. Rab\u00e1ris, a fairly numerous class, breed cattle, sheep, and camels, or cultivate. Some of them are well-to-do and are village headmen. Bharv\u00e1ds keep goats and sheep or graze cattle. They are generally poor living on milk and millet cakes. Strongly built and of copper complexion, they wear a headcloth, a short coat, and short trousers, k\u00e1ch. Among Rab\u00e1ris all marriages are celebrated on the same day.\n\nLabourers.\n\nOf Labourers and Miscellaneous Workers there are eight classes; Sar\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, knife and sword sharpeners; Ods, pond diggers and mud wall builders; Gol\u00e1r\u00e1n\u00e1s, grain sifters; Baj\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, acrobats; V\u00e1dis, snake charmers and jugglers; R\u00e1val\u00eds, salt makers and sellers; Min\u00e1s, gatherers of forest produce; and V\u00e1ghris, fowlers and hunters. These are in poor circumstances, and, except the V\u00e1ghris, are few in number.\n\n1 Probably from the Sanskrit Kshaur, shaving.\nUnder the head Aboriginal Tribes come Bhils, a very poor and large class. Generally found in or near forests, they earn a scanty living by gathering gum and other forest produce. They are also given to cattle stealing and robbery, but are not so daring as the Kolis.\n\nUnder the head Leather Workers come Mochis, shoemakers, and Ch\u00e1madi\u00e1s, tanners. They are fairly numerous and poor.\n\nBesides the Ch\u00e1madi\u00e1s there are two Depressed castes: Dheds, of whom there are two divisions, Garudas, Dhed priests, and Dheds; and Jh\u00e1mpr\u00e1s or Bhangi\u00e1s, sweepers. These are poor and fairly numerous. The Dheds support themselves by weaving coarse cotton cloth.\n\nUnder the head Beggars come S\u00e1dhus and Atits. The S\u00e1dhus are religious ascetics, most of them poor; the Atits are married religious beggars, a small well-to-do class.\n\nOf the Musalm\u00e1n population of 46,678 souls, 41,319 were Sunnis and 5359 Shi\u00e1s. In addition to the four usual divisions, Syeds, Shaikhs, Path\u00e1ns, and Moghals there are six sects; Mehdaviyyah, Bohor\u00e1s, Memans, Momn\u00e1s, T\u00e1\u00eds, and Khoj\u00e1s. The Mehdaviyyah are not numerous, but as the Jh\u00e1lori house which rules at P\u00e1lanpur is of this persuasion, most of them are in a good condition. Called by other Musalm\u00e1ns Gher Mehdis because they do not believe in Mehdi or the coming Im\u00e1m, the Mehdaviyyah are converted Hindus, the followers of a certain Muhammad Mehdi born in 1443 (847 H.) in Jaunpur a village near Benares. At the age of forty Muhammad became a saint, wali, and both at Jaunpur and afterwards at Mecca made many converts. After his return to India in 1497 and 1499 at Ahmedabad and P\u00e1tan, he claimed to be the looked-for Mehdi. He is said to have worked many miracles. While travelling he died at Farah in Khor\u00e1san, and part of his followers under Syed Khondmir returned to Gujar\u00e1t and for some time remained there unmolested, professing their faith openly and challenging controversy regarding its origin and truth. They grew in numbers and importance until the year 1523 (930 H.), when under the orders of Sult\u00e1n Muzaffar II. (1513-1526) some of their number were killed and troops were sent against the rest at P\u00e1tan. Offering resistance they were defeated and their leader Syed Khondmir killed. In 1645 when Aurangzeb was Governor this sect was again persecuted at Ahmedabad, and, for declaring that Mehdi had appeared and was gone, several of them were put to the sword. They still, although free to profess their faith, practise caution, tak\u00edyyah, and are all anxious to pass as orthodox Muslims. Shi\u00e1s in name they hold that Muhammad their saint was the last Im\u00e1m and expected Mehdi, and as he is come they neither repent for their sins nor pray for the souls of the dead. They are said to bury the dead with the face down. Marrying only among themselves they have no headman but form circles, d\u00e1r\u00ed\u00e1s, governed by rules of their\n\n---\n\n1 They are on this account, particularly in the Deccan, called D\u00e1\u00edrah w\u00e1l\u00e1s.\nown. Property in default of heirs belongs to their Syeds. As a class the P\u00e1lanpur Musalm\u00e1ns are not fanatical but rather liberal-minded in matters of religion.\n\nExcept the Diw\u00e1n of P\u00e1lanpur, the Naw\u00e1b of R\u00e1dhanpur, the Th\u00e1kor of Thar\u00e1d, and the R\u00e1na of V\u00e1v, the petty chieftains are little removed from the rank of cultivators and are sunk in poverty, crime, and ignorance. In the smaller estates, owing to the constant cattle thefts, house-breaking, and highway robbery, unless Government supervision were very active and strict, trade would hardly exist. The dangerous classes, Kolis, Bhils, Sindis, and Th\u00e1kard\u00e1s, earn a scanty living by field work in the rainy season, and by cutting grass or helping the upper land-owners in the cold season; but both the cold and hot seasons are chiefly passed in cattle-stealing, house-breaking, and highway robbery. During April and May, Kolis live chiefly on the berry of the pilu, Salvador\u00e1 persica. The Kanbis, chiefly of the Kadva caste, are little better off than the lower class cultivators, fleeced on the one hand by the chiefs' officers and revenue farmers, and on the other by Kolis to whom over and over again they pay tell money, morkh\u00e1i, to get back their stolen cattle.\u00b9\n\nThe people have not as yet shown any tendency to gather into towns, but the opening of the railway will probably cause some change. In this district there is one village or town to about every six miles; each village containing an average of 484 inhabitants and about ninety-six houses. Except the people of four towns numbering 49,502 souls, or 9\u00b767 per cent of the entire inhabitants, the population of the P\u00e1lanpur districts lived, in 1872, in 1054 villages with an average of 439 souls to each village. Three towns, P\u00e1lanpur 17,189, R\u00e1dhanpur 13,910, and Deesa 12,917, had over 10,000 souls; and one, Sami 5486, had between 10,000 and 5000. Of the whole number of villages 304 had less than 200 inhabitants; 461 had from 200 to 500; 201 from 500 to 1000; 72 from 1000 to 2000; 14 from 2000 to 3000; and 2 from 3000 to 5000. As regards the number of houses, there was in 1872 a total of 101,382, or an average of 16\u00b775 houses to the square mile. Of the total number only 4157 houses lodging 20,122 persons or 3\u00b793 per cent of the whole population at the rate of 4\u00b784 souls to each house, were buildings with brick walls and tiled roofs. The remaining houses, accommodating 491,799 persons or 96\u00b707 per cent with a population per house of 5\u00b706 souls, included all buildings covered with reeds or whose outer walls were of mud.\n\nIn ordinary years there is little or no movements among the people. In bad years outsiders may press in from M\u00e1rw\u00e1r and a few of the local poor may move south into the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r lands of P\u00e1tan and Visalnagar, and in good years a few may be drawn to P\u00e1lanpur. But these movements are never on any large scale.\n\n\u00b9 The term morkh\u00e1i is applied to money paid to informers for recovering stolen property. Lieut.-Colonel P. H. LeGeyt.\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nAGRICULTURE.\n\nThe soil is of three kinds, black, k\u00e1letar; light mixed with sand, gor\u00e1du; and sandy, thalia. Of these the black soil is suited to cotton, rice, millet, and wheat, but specially to cotton, and if there is water, to sugarcane; the light, gor\u00e1du, is fitted for the different kinds of pulse; and the sandy, thalia, for pulse and tal, Sesamum indicum.\n\nWithin the P\u00e1lanpur state there is a very large tract of good arable waste land, several miles in extent, to the north-east of P\u00e1lanpur, but owing chiefly to the water being unwholesome and in some measure to insecurity of life and property, outsiders cannot be tempted to settle, and tillage spreads slowly though land is offered free of taxes for several years. The region thus lying desolate was inhabited under former Rajput rulers. In other states and subdivisions, there is very little waste arable land. All such lands came gradually under tillage when order was introduced under British rule. The district has not been surveyed, and as in some places the assessment is levied on the plough and not on the land, the exact tillage area is unknown. Its specially large number of cattle want more grazing land than is required in other parts of Gujar\u00e1t. Roughly about three-fifths of the whole is under tillage, and of the remaining two-fifths one is arable waste and the other unarable. In the hot weather, wheat, gram, rapeseed, spices and condiments are grown in watered lands.\n\nExcept on irrigated lands, manure is not generally used. When it is used the villagers either take it from the village dunghill or keep small manure heaps in their own yards. As a rule what is wanted for such special crops as sugarcane is taken from the village dunghill. In some districts unwatered lands are allowed to lie fallow. In watered lands yielding three crops in a year, the crops are sown in rotation. In unwatered lands there is no rule of crop rotation, except that in the case of guv\u00e1r, Cyamopsis psoralioides, the need of change is so far admitted that it is not twice sown in the same field.\n\nThe size of a plough of land, or the area that can be tilled by a plough drawn by one pair of oxen, varies from twelve to eighteen acres. The field tools wanted to till a plough of land are a plough, hal; a clod crusher, sam\u00e1r; a sowing drill, ch\u00e1var; a harrow, dant\u00e1li;\nChapter IV. Agriculture.\n\nHoldings vary from eight to fifty acres and upwards. A five-acre holding would not make a cultivator as well off as a retail shopkeeper or as a man on 16s. (Rs. 8) a month.\n\nCrops.\n\nThe crops are, of Cereals; rice, d\u00e1ngr, Oryza sativa; wheat, ghau, Triticum aestivum; millet, b\u00e1jro, Pennicillaria spicata; Indian millet, j\u00fav\u00e1r, Sorghum vulgare; kuri (not identified); banti, Panicum spicatum; kar\u00e1ng or k\u00e1ng, Panicum italicum; barley, jav, Hordeum hexastichon; kodrachina, Paspalum scrobiculatum; maize, mak\u00e1di, Zea mays; and b\u00e1v\u00f3, Panicum frumentaceum. Of Pulses, mag, Phaseolus radiatus; tuver, Cajanus indicus; gram, chana, Cicer arietinum; adad, Phaseolus mungo; j\u00e1lar or tura v\u00e1l, Dolichos lablab; chola, Vigna catiang; and guv\u00e1r, Cyamopsis psoralioides. Of Oil seeds, rape-seed, sarsav, Brassica napus; Sesame, tal, Sesamum indicum, and castor-seed, eranda, Ricinus communis. Of Fibres, cotton, kap\u00e1s, Gossypium herbaceum; Bombay hemp, bhindi, and son, Crotalaria juncea; and munj, Saccharum munja. Of Miscellaneous crops, sugarcane, serd\u00ed, Saccharum officinarum; opium, aph\u00edn, Papaver somniferum; mulberry, shetur, Morus indica; tobacco, tamb\u00e1ku, Nicotiana tabacum; meth\u00ed, Trigonella foenumgraecum; ajmo, Apium involucratum; coriander seed, dh\u00e1na, Coriandrum sativum; cumin seed, jiru utmi, Cuminum cyminum; r\u00e1jgaro, Amaranthus polygamus; red pepper, marcha, Capsicum frutescens; mustard, r\u00fai, Sinapis spicata; and vari\u00e1ti, Foeniculum panmorum. The staple crops of the district are rice, millet, wheat, banti, kuri, and gram.\n\nCereals.\n\nRice, Oryza sativa, of two kinds, kamod and v\u00e1ri, sown in nurseries and then planted out, grows only in marshy low-lying lands. Rain-watered rice sown in July is ready for reaping in November; and well-watered rice sown in the middle of June is reaped in October. Wheat is sown in October or November and reaped in March or April. It is of two kinds, k\u00e1tha and v\u00e1jia; the former requires black soil, and if it be slightly salt the crop grows all the better; the latter flourishes in any soil, but wants water and manure. Millet, b\u00e1jro, Pennicillaria spicata, grows in any soil, but does best in a mixture of black soil and sand. The other cereals are sown in July or August and reaped in October or November, and require no particular soil.\n\nPulses.\n\nTuver, Cajanus indicus, is sown in July and August and reaped in February and March; gram, chana, Cicer arietinum, is sown in October and November, and reaped in March and April. The other pulses are sown in July and August, and reaped in October and November.\n\nFibres.\n\nCotton Fibre, kap\u00e1s, Gossypium herbaceum, requires black or rich alluvial soil. It is of three kinds, s\u00e1m, dh\u00e1k\u00e1n\u00ed, and rat\u00e1riu or l\u00e1liu, all of them sown in July and August and picked in March and April. In 1876-77 the area under cotton was 49,578 acres and the\nproduce 32,485 cwts. against 38,462 acres and 30,087 cwts. in 1875-76. Bombay Hemp, *san*, *Crotalaria juncea*, is sown in July to a limited extent, and reaped in January. *Munj*, *Saccharum munja*, described\\(^1\\) as \u2018straight, every part smooth except the inside of the base of the cusped long margined linear white-nerved leaves\u2019 grows from eight to ten feet high. The stalk when split longitudinally yields a fibre measuring about 4\u00bd feet long with a very light yellow colour outside and whitish inside, and making cordage of fair strength.\n\nSugarcane, *serdi*, *Saccharum officinarum*, can without watering be grown in the marshy lands near the hills. The cultivation of the poppy has been forbidden by Government since 1st October 1878. The mulberry, *shetur*, *Moras indica*, bears freely, but is only grown here and there in gardens. Tobacco is a crop of little importance. Though with no marked advance in the style of tillage, sugarcane, cotton, and wheat, have of late years, to a considerable extent, taken the place of millet. In rain-watered lands second crops are not as a rule grown, and where grown the yield is small. The approximate outturn of produce to the acre is for wheat 360 to 720 lbs. (9-18 *mans*) according to the soil; of millet, *b\u00e1jro*, 300 to 600 pounds (7\u00bd-15 *mans*), and of Indian millet, *juv\u00e1r*, 300 to 600 pounds (7\u00bd-15 *mans*).\n\nMost of the land is in the hands of holders of service lands, *pas\u00e1ita*, who work in the fields in the rainy season, and during the rest of the year busy themselves chiefly in cattle-stealing. Skilled husbandmen are comparatively few in number and the majority of them are hampered with debt, and more or less in the hands of village money-lenders of the V\u00e1nia caste. There is a large class of landless day-labourers who, when not cattle-stealing, house-breaking or robbing highways, hire themselves as day-labourers. Women and children are largely employed. They are usually paid in food or grain, with perhaps a little money.\n\nThe crops are liable to suffer from five causes; frost, *him*; locusts, which have come thrice during the past ten years; the larva of a small moth called the *katra*, which appears at the opening of the rainy season; a red wheat blight called *geru* and a black Indian millet blight or smut called *\u00e1gio*. Of these the locusts have, during the past thirty years, four times injured the general harvest, and at the beginning of the 1873 rains, the *katra* did much damage.\n\nClose to the Ban\u00e1s the land is liable to be flooded, but the floods do not at furthest pass more than a mile from either bank.\n\nExcept near the hills, the district is liable to droughts from want of rain, and in 1813, 1825, 1833,\\(^2\\) 1839, 1870, and 1877, suffered\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Roxburgh\u2019s Flora Indica, I. 246.\n\n\\(^2\\) This was a year of great scarcity amounting to famine. The early crops were entirely destroyed, and grain prices rose to a height unknown since the great famine of 1813. To help the importation of grain and lighten distress the Diw\u00e1n removed grain transit duties, and gave every encouragement to sinking wells. Great precautions had to be taken to preserve the public peace, much threatened by predatory bands of lawless starving Kolis. Bom. Gov. to the Court of Directors, 10th December 1833.\nseverely. The years held in remembrance as times of scarcity and famine are 1747, 1756, 1785, 1791, 1804, 1813, 1825, 1834, 1839, 1842, and 1849. Of these the severest was the famine of 1813. In 1811 the crops failed, in 1812 a promising harvest was destroyed by locusts, and in 1813 the crops again failed from want of rain. To such straits were the people brought that some are said to have lived on human flesh. In such numbers did they die that the survivors could not carry away the dead. Villages were left desolate, and parts of the district formerly under tillage have ever since lain waste. The price of grain was six pounds the rupee. In P\u00e1l\u00e1npur efforts were made to relieve the distress. A state grain store was opened selling grain at sixteen pounds the rupee. Useful works were undertaken near the city and the workmen fed, and the rural watch was increased. Similar measures were adopted in R\u00e1dhanpur. In the other years scarcity has been partial, the distress and want of grain not rising to famine. The chief measures have been to keep order and save the fields from plunder by employing bodies of armed patrols, and by advances of money and grain to encourage the people to bring more land under irrigation. From 1861 to 1865 on account of the very high price of cotton, and also from scanty and unseasonable rain, millet prices rose to eight pounds the rupee. The Bhils and other lower classes fed on roots and bark, and deaths from want are said to have occurred. In years of scarcity it has been the practice to stop all export of grain.\nCHAPTER V.\n\nCAPITAL.\n\nWhen cultivators save money, they either hoard it, or turn it into ornaments for their women. Traders invest their savings chiefly in trade and money-lending. There are no large banking houses, but Deesa, P\u00e1lanpur, and R\u00e1dhanpur have bankers of considerable wealth. Except by T\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs who borrow from town bankers either within P\u00e1lanpur or Baroda limits, loans are chiefly taken from village shopkeepers. By advancing money and paying himself at harvest time, the village V\u00e1nia absorbs almost all the cultivators' little gains.\n\nThe yearly rate of interest varies from six to fifteen per cent. In small dealings, when an article is given in pawn, the rate is six per cent; in large dealings with a mortgage on land, houses, or movable property, it is nine per cent; in petty agricultural advances, if there is a lien on the crops, the rate is twelve per cent; and if on personal security, from twelve to fifteen per cent. On money invested in buying houses and lands, three or four per cent would be deemed a fair return.\n\nIn 1850 the daily wage of a man employed in field labour was 3d. (2 as.) and two pounds of millet, of a blacksmith 6d. (4 as.), of a bricklayer 6d. (4 as.), and of a carpenter 10\u00bdd. (7 as.). In 1870-71 the daily wage of a field labourer was 3\u00bed. (2\u00bd as.) and two pounds of grain, of a blacksmith or bricklayer 9d. (6 as.), and of a carpenter 1s. 3d. (10 as.). In 1874-75 field labourers earned 4\u00bdd. (3 as.) and two pounds of grain a day, blacksmiths and bricklayers 1s. (8 as.), and carpenters 1s. 6d. (12 as.). In 1877-78 the daily wage of a man employed in field labour was 4\u00bdd. (3 as.) and two pounds of millet, of a blacksmith 1s. (8 as.), of a bricklayer 1s. 3d. (10 as.), and of a carpenter 1s. 6d. (12 as.). Women and children are largely employed as day labourers. The usual terms are a little more grain than is wanted for food, and from 3d. to 4\u00bdd. (2 - 3\u00bc as.) in money.\n\nThe following table gives the chief produce prices in 1830, 1850, 1860, 1871, 1875, and 1878:\n\n| Name          | 1830 | 1850 | 1860 | 1871 | 1875 | 1878 |\n|---------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Best rice     | 19\u00bd  | 16   | 16   | 12\u00bd | 12\u00bd | 12\u00bd |\n| Common rice   | 38\u00bd  | 27\u00bd  | 27\u00bd  | 24   | 24   | 18\u00bd |\n| Millet, b\u00f4jre | 40   | 36\u00bd  | 32   | 21\u00bd | 21\u00bd | 23\u00bd |\n| Wheat         | 64   | 42   | 38\u00bd  | 32   | 42\u00bd | 20   |\n\nP\u00e1lanpur Rupee Produce Prices in Pounds, 1830-1878.\nGold and silver are weighed according to the following scale: six rice grains, one rati; three rat\u00eds, one v\u00e1l; sixteen v\u00e1l\u00eds, one gadi\u00e1na; two gadi\u00e1n\u00e1s, one tola. Articles of bulk are weighed according to the following scale: two adhols, one navt\u00e1nk; eight navt\u00e1nks, one ser; forty sers, one man. Of these one adhol is equal to 2\u00bd rupees\u2019 weight. The measure of time is sixty vipals, one pal; sixty pals, one ghadi; eight ghad\u00eds, one pohar; eight pohars, one day and night. The R\u00e1dhanpur grain measure is twenty rupees\u2019 weight, one pav\u00e1l\u00fa; two pav\u00e1l\u00eds, one adhv\u00e1li; two adhv\u00e1l\u00eds, one p\u00e1li; five p\u00e1lis, one m\u00e1nu; four m\u00e1n\u00e1s, one sa\u00fa; and sixteen sais, one kalsi. The P\u00e1lanpur grain measure is 1\u00be sers of forty rupees\u2019 weight each, one adhv\u00e1li; two adhv\u00e1l\u00eds, one p\u00e1li; six p\u00e1lis, one m\u00e1nu; and sixty-four m\u00e1n\u00e1s, one kalsi. In other parts of the district, the p\u00e1li weighs from 1\u00bd sers to three sers of forty rupees\u2019 weight each, and one m\u00e1nu contains from four to seven p\u00e1lis. The measure of length is eighteen tasus or finger breadths, one h\u00e1th or cubit; twenty-four tasus, one gaj; 1\u00bd gaj, one v\u00e1r, yard; 1\u00bd v\u00e1r\u00eds, one karam; and eighteen hundred karams, one g\u00e1u. Land is measured by the following scale: 6\u00bc square h\u00e1ths, one square karam; fifty square karams, one uplu; two square uplus, one is; and fifty square is, one oli\u00e1va. One oli\u00e1va is equal to about 4\u00bd acres.\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nTRADE.\n\nWithin the limits of the P\u00e1lanpur Superintendency there are cross country tracks but no made roads. Rajput\u00e1na traders coming by P\u00e1li to Dholera, generally pass through P\u00e1lanpur, and those going to Cutch, through Thar\u00e1d or V\u00e1v. In P\u00e1lanpur the roads are deep with sand, and for heavily laden carts six or eight bullocks are wanted. In the Thar\u00e1d districts, where the ground is harder and the roads lighter, goods are generally carried on carts or on camels. In 1873-74, from P\u00e1lanpur two and a half miles to Jeg\u00e1na, a rough road was made with broken bricks and tiles. In the east the Western Rajput\u00e1na State Railway opened for traffic on the 15th November 1879 passes through about forty miles of the Superintendency.\n\nThere are in all four post offices, two in the P\u00e1lanpur state at P\u00e1lanpur and Deesa, one at R\u00e1dhanpur in the R\u00e1dhanpur state, and the fourth at Suig\u00e1m. These post offices are under the supervision of the inspector of post offices, Ahmedabad division. Rural messengers are also employed; one, at the P\u00e1lanpur post office, delivers letters in the villages round; one, at Suig\u00e1m, carries letters to and from Thar\u00e1d through V\u00e1v; and one to and from V\u00e1r\u00e1hi from the post office at R\u00e1dhanpur.\n\nThe chief traders are V\u00e1ni\u00e1s, Loh\u00e1n\u00e1s, Memans, Bohor\u00e1s, and Khatris. The chief articles of trade are of exports, saltpetre, grain, rape-seed, sesamum, cotton, the essence, attar, of ch\u00e1mpa, Michelia champaca, and kevda, Pandanus odoratissimus, cattle, and clarified butter; and of imports, tobacco, fruit, spices, molasses, sugarcandy, sugar, and cotton and silk cloth. The estimated yearly value of the whole trade, about equally divided between exports and imports, is from \u00a3100,000 to \u00a3150,000 (Rs. 10 - 15 l\u0101khs). The exports go chiefly to M\u00e1rv\u00e1r, Cutch, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Gujar\u00e1t, and Bombay. Among them the export of cattle is of special interest, oxen of the Vadh\u00e1r, K\u00e1nkrej, and Deesa breeds, the largest and handsomest cattle in Gujar\u00e1t, fetching from \u00a310 to \u00a330 (Rs. 100 - 300) a pair. A small cultivation of opium in the P\u00e1lanpur state has, since October 1878, been stopped under an engagement with the Bombay Government. Of the imports the fruit, spices, tobacco, and sugar come from Bombay, Kaira, P\u00e1rkar, and M\u00e1rv\u00e1r; the cotton cloth, much of it of European make, from Bombay; and the silks from Ahmedabad and P\u00e1li.\nThere is a cotton ginning factory at Sami, managed by a merchant and helped by the R\u00e1dhanpur chief. Coarse cloth is, to a small extent, woven in hand-looms.\n\nTrade is carried on at permanent markets, the leading trade centres being P\u00e1lanpur, R\u00e1dhanpur, Deesa, Sami, and Munjpur. Except connected with the camp at Deesa, no large market has of late been developed; and owing to the risk of plunder by robbers and the competition of railways, traffic has deserted the old highway between M\u00e1rw\u00e1r and Gujar\u00e1t through P\u00e1li and P\u00e1lanpur.\n\nOf twenty-four yearly fairs the chief are: the Sankeshvar fair, at Sankeshvar in R\u00e1dhanpur, held on Chaitra sud 15th (March) in honour of Dosla P\u00e1rasn\u00e1th. This, a Jain festival attended by about 5000 Shr\u00e1vaks, and by traders from Ahmedabad, Visnagar, Virang\u00e1m, P\u00e1tri, and P\u00e1tan, lasts for eight days. The chief articles sold are silk and cotton cloth and copper and brass vessels. The Loteshvar fair at Trakod in R\u00e1dhanpur, held on Ph\u00e1g\u00e1n vad 3rd (February) in honour of Loteshvar Mah\u00e1dev, is a Br\u00e1hman festival, attended by about 2000 Hindus, and lasts for three days. The chief articles sold are religious books and brass vessels of worship. The Dharnidhar fair at Dhema in Thar\u00e1d, held on Jeth sud 11th (June) and Ph\u00e1g\u00e1n sud 15th (February) in honour of Dharnidharji, the third incarnation of Vishnu, lasts each time for one day, and is attended by about 8000 pilgrims. The only articles sold are sweetmeats. The Oghd Th\u00e1l\u00ed fair at Terv\u00e1da, held on Ash\u00e1d vad 30th (July) in honour of Oghad N\u00e1thji, a Hindu saint, is attended by about 2000 Hindus and lasts for one day. There is no trade except in sweetmeats. The Gotarka fair at Gotarka in R\u00e1dhanpur, held on 15th Zilk\u00e1d in honour of Pir M\u00e1h B\u00e1lisha, is attended by about 5000 Musalm\u00e1ns and lasts for two days. Only ordinary fruits and sweetmeats are sold. The other fairs attended by from about seventy to 1500 persons and lasting only one day are of no importance.\n\nTo prepare champa and kerda essence, a tinned copper kettle lined with clay is filled with freshwater flowers and leaves and set on a hearth. Near the kettle and joined to it by a claylined bamboo tube, another claylined vessel, filled with sandal oil in the proportion of one pound of oil to ten pounds of water in the kettle stands in a large earthen pot filled with water and loaded with a weight. Fire is applied till the water in the kettle boils, and the steam, passing through the bamboo tube, is condensed in the cool oil-pot. When this is over, the oil pot is emptied into a third well-closed vessel with a hole which can be opened or shut at will. When the oil and water have settled the hole is opened, and the water escaping leaves the essential oil, attur. In making the better quality of essence this process is several times repeated.\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nHISTORY.\n\nThe territory included in the Political Superintendency of P\u00e1lanpur has, like the more central parts of Gujar\u00e1t, passed during historical times under the sway of the different Rajput dynasties of Anhilv\u00e1da (746-1304); then of the Ahmedabad Sult\u00e1ns (1390-1573); then of the Moghal Emperors (1573-1757); then of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s (1757-1819); and last under the British. Local historical details are given under the heads of the different states.\n\nWhen these districts came under the charge of a British officer (1809), they included the states of P\u00e1lanpur, R\u00e1dhanpur, Thar\u00e1d, Morv\u00e1da, V\u00e1v, Diodar, V\u00e1r\u00e1hi, Terv\u00e1da, Snig\u00e1m, S\u00e1ntalpur, Bh\u00e1bhar, and Ch\u00e1dchat. The K\u00e1nkrej petty states remained under the Mahi K\u00e1ntha Agency till, in 1844, because of their geographical position, they were transferred to the P\u00e1lanpur Superintendency.\n\nBritish connection with P\u00e1lanpur dates from 1809 when an agreement was drawn up similar to the K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r engagements, under which P\u00e1lanpur promised to pay the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r a yearly tribute of \u00a35000 (Rs. 50,000). In 1813 the chief, Diw\u00e1n Firoz Kh\u00e1n, was murdered by his officers and his son Fateh Kh\u00e1n appealed for help to the British and G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r Governments. A force was sent to P\u00e1lanpur and Fateh Kh\u00e1n was formally adopted by his uncle Shamsher Kh\u00e1n, who had been raised to the vacant chiefship by the rebel officers, and it was arranged that Fateh Kh\u00e1n should marry Shamsher Kh\u00e1n\u2019s daughter and that Shamsher Kh\u00e1n should manage the state. As the uncle and nephew did not agree they were in 1816 summoned to Sidhpur. An inquiry showed that, since 1813 the state debts had largely increased; that the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r tribute had been unpaid; and that Shamsher Kh\u00e1n had by unauthorized grants given away nearly 100 villages or about a fifth part of the whole state. When Shamsher Kh\u00e1n saw that the decision of the British officer was going against him he persuaded Fateh Kh\u00e1n to return to P\u00e1lanpur without asking leave. As a punishment for this conduct a force was in October 1817 sent to P\u00e1lanpur, and the town assaulted and taken. Fateh Kh\u00e1n speedily submitted and Captain Miles was appointed Political Superintendent with a minute control over the finances of the state, the revenue being assigned\n\n---\n\n1 No. XIX. Aitchison's Treaties (1876), IV. 47.\nto the state banker under Government guarantee.\\(^1\\) A fixed allowance was set apart for the personal expenses of the chief and the sanction of the Superintendent was made necessary to all important disbursements. The chief agreed (28th November 1817) among other things to receive an agent from the Gaikwar in the confidence of the British Government, whose suggestions he was bound to follow in all matters relating to the Government; to subsidize a body of 250 horse;\\(^2\\) to pay his tribute punctually to the Gaikwar; and to protect no offenders against the British and Gaikwar Governments.\\(^3\\) In September 1822 Fateh Khan agreed to forbid the transport of contraband opium through his territory.\\(^4\\)\n\nThe relations of the Radhanpur state with the British Government date from 1813 in the time of Sher Khan Babi, when Captain Carnac then Resident at Baroda concluded (16th December) a treaty of four articles with the Nawab. According to this treaty, the Gaikwar, though he could not meddle with the internal management of Radhanpur, was empowered under the advice and mediation of the British Government to control its external relations and to help the Nawab in defending his state from foreign invasion.\\(^5\\) During the next five or six years the Nawab finding himself powerless to check the raids of the Khosas and other marauders from Sind sought the help of the British Government, and offered to pay his share of the cost of crushing the banditti. Help was at once given. In 1819 Colonel Barklay expelled the marauders from all parts of Gujar\u00e1t, and Major Miles who accompanied him as Political Agent, by the orders of the Bombay Government negotiated an agreement with the Nawab (6th July 1820). Under the terms of this agreement the Nawab bound himself not to harbour robbers, plunderers, or enemies of the British Government; when necessary to accompany the British troops to chastise marauders; and to pay a yearly tribute in proportion to his means.\\(^6\\) On the 18th February 1822 the yearly tribute was for five years fixed at a sum of \u00a31700 (Rs. 17,000). It continued in force until 1825, when the Honourable Court of Directors considering the state unable to pay so large a sum, the demand was, by the order of the Bombay Government, remitted in full on the 26th July of that year. Since then Radhanpur has been free from all tribute. This chief in 1822 subscribed to the opium engagement.\n\nExcept Kankrej, the relations between the remaining states and the British Government date from 1819, when much harassed by the raids of Khosas and other desert plunderers, the chiefs prayed the British Government to help them, offering to pay a share of the charges incurred in restoring order. In 1820 after the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Recently (1874) Government have thought fit to withdraw the guarantee and relax this minute financial supervision.\n\n\\(^2\\) Reduced to 150 under the sanction of Government dated the 2nd January 1818.\n\n\\(^3\\) Aitchison's Treaties (1876), IV. 52-54.\n\n\\(^4\\) Aitchison's Treaties (1876), IV. 55.\n\n\\(^5\\) Aitchison's Treaties (1876), IV. 58.\n\n\\(^6\\) Aitchison's Treaties (1876), IV. 59.\nKhos\u00e1s had been driven out, the chiefs entered into agreements similar to the R\u00e1dhanpur engagement of 1820. As regards tribute, on the 14th February 1821 the British Government agreed that in the case of Tharad no tribute should be exacted until the revenue had increased one-half, when one-third of the increase was to be paid. This remained in force until 1825, when all these states were freed from paying tribute. In 1826 further agreements, partly in supersession of the former ones were signed and delivered to the British Government, wherein the chiefs promised to allow no Kolis, Rajputs, or armed men of other districts to live in their territories without informing the British Government; to give up to the British and the Baroda Governments any robbers and peace-breakers who had sought shelter in their domains; to help with all their forces in suppressing the Khos\u00e1s and other freebooters, and to commit no irregularities in the neighbouring districts. These chiefs have also subscribed to the opium engagement of 1822.\n\nAt first the relations of the British Government with these states were purely political, but as the Superintendent held the position of universal arbiter, it soon (1820) became necessary to place subordinate officers called agents, k\u00e1rkuns, in the small states, with a view both of collecting information and keeping order. These k\u00e1rkuns are now being gradually changed into th\u00e1nd\u00e1rs or commandants of posts, officers invested with certain fixed civil and criminal powers. At the beginning of British management these districts were the haunt of daring freebooters, some of them people of the country, others, Khos\u00e1s from Sind. Though the states are still backward and tillage spreads slowly, disorder has been stopped and considerable progress made. The Superintendent's head quarters are at P\u00e1lanpur, the chief town of the district, though both R\u00e1dhanpur and Deesa are nearly as rich and populous.\n\n---\n\n1 Aitchison's Treaties (1876), IV. 61.\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nLAND ADMINISTRATION.\n\nExcept in the unusual case of persons holding land hereditarily, karam jodia, as it is called, who have an occupancy right, or butta land is almost everywhere in the hands of tenants-at-will, most of whom in state villages hold direct from the chief, and in cadet, bh\u00e1y\u00e1d, or proprietary, mul gir\u00e1sia, villages from the cadet or proprietor. There are no small land-holders that do not hold under some landlord. The cultivator has no power to make over his holding by sale or otherwise, and so long as he pays the rent, the chief, though he may do so at any time, seldom disturbs him. If forced to give up his land, the cultivator cannot claim for money spent by him in improvements, but in some cases rich crops are lightly assessed, because of the private capital spent in growing them. In the P\u00e1lampur state, when a tenant builds a well he is paid 20s. or 24s. (Rs. 10' or 12) by the state, who acquires thereby a proprietary right in the well, and if the tenant gives up the land he has no claim for compensation. On the other hand, in R\u00e1dhanpur, if a tenant is forced to leave his land, he is paid for any improvements he may have made. Rent-free service lands, pas\u00e1ila, and lands granted in charity are sometimes sub-let to peasants, who pay rent to the original holders; on such lands the state receives no share of the assessment, but under the name sal\u00e1m\u00ed the original holder makes the state a small yearly payment. Except for special reasons, charitable, dharm\u00e1da, lands are never resumed and are held hereditarily on condition of loyal conduct on the part of the grantee. Holders of service lands are liable to be turned out, if they fail in their service; and the chief may or may not continue service lands from father to son. In R\u00e1dhanpur holders of service and charity lands have no power to transfer the land, unless the original grant contains a proviso to that effect. No land is liable to be sold by order of the civil courts in payment of a cultivator's private debts, and when a decree is passed against his property, a special exception is made in favour of his field tools. In the districts of Deesa, Dhanera, Khimat, D\u00e1ntiv\u00e1da, and some villages in west Dhandhar, the assessment on tobacco, pepper, and the early crops is paid in money at fixed rates on the number of ploughs. In the rest of the district, except in some few villages in the R\u00e1dhanpur state, the revenue is collected under the crop-share, bh\u00e1gbal\u00e1\u00ed, system. The share is fixed on a rough estimate, dh\u00e1l or\nkaltarh made by a state official and the village patel, who, according to the custom of the village and the nature of the crop, credit the state with a certain number of mans of produce. The state share varies from about $\\frac{1}{2}$, a point it seldom reaches, to $\\frac{1}{8}$. Village customs differ widely, depending on various causes, among which the chief are nearness to markets, quality of soil, and size of village. The ready money, nagdi, levies are small. In assessing crops it is not the custom to deduct the cost of production from the probable outturn. The only exception is the case of sugarcane in the P\u00e1lanpur state. In the Dhandhar sub-division of the P\u00e1lanpur state, the assessment is paid in four instalments in January, April, July, and October; in Deesa, Dhanera and other sub-divisions, the dates for payment of assessment are not fixed, but the collections are generally made after the holi festival (March-April) and up to the end of June. The practice of leasing villages to revenue contractors was never general in P\u00e1lanpur. Under Colonel Keily in 1851, the number of villages leased to revenue contractors was reduced, and in 1870 under Colonel Disbrowe the practice entirely ceased.\n\nIn the P\u00e1lanpur and R\u00e1dhanpur states, the rents are collected by village accountants, tal\u00e1tis, under the control of revenue managers, tehsild\u00e1rs, who again are subordinate to the chief's revenue minister. Where necessary, clerks are appointed to help the tehsild\u00e1rs to assess the crops. In other parts of the Superintendency, except in Thar\u00e1d and V\u00e1v, where the chief's share of the revenue is collected by officials appointed for the purpose, the proprietors themselves realize the revenues with the help of tal\u00e1tis and managers, k\u00e1md\u00e1rs. To recover arrears, the tehsild\u00e1r may impose a billet, mohsal, on the defaulter, taking from him, besides the cost of the man billeted on him, a daily money fine of from $\\frac{3}{4}$d. to 6d. ($\\frac{1}{2}$ - 4 as.). If a billet fails, as much of the cultivator's property as will cover the demand is attached and sold. If a cultivator becomes a pauper, the revenue due by him is recovered gradually whenever he may be able to pay. In the Thar\u00e1d and V\u00e1v estates, the chief recovers the arrears from the property of defaulter himself. In other estates, the proprietors have to ask the th\u00e1ndar or officer in charge of their district to recover it. In the P\u00e1lanpur state, if a crop is destroyed by fire or if owing to scanty rainfall, a crop is likely to be short, the power of granting remissions rests solely with the chief, and is not entrusted to any officer of the state. In R\u00e1dhanpur remissions are granted only when the crops are damaged after the estimate, dh\u00e1l, has been made, and such remissions can be granted only by the revenue minister with the permission of the Naw\u00e1b. In other parts of the Superintendency remissions are also granted when necessary. On the whole, the land assessment is not heavy, nor is the system of collecting it oppressive.\n\n---\n\n1 There is no difference in meaning between dh\u00e1l and kaltar. The term dh\u00e1l is used in R\u00e1dhanpur, and kaltar in P\u00e1lanpur.\n\n2 The estimate of the crops of rice, jw\u00e9r, kuri, k\u00e1ng, and banti grains is made before, and that of bajri, wheat, pulse, and oil-seed after, the crop is cut.\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nJUSTICE.\n\nBesides the chiefs of P\u00e1lanpur and R\u00e1dhanpur who, within the limits of their states, exercise full civil and criminal powers, and some of the smaller chiefs, who enjoy a limited jurisdiction, the maintenance of order and suppression of crime are, under the Political Superintendent, vested in six police and magisterial officers styled th\u00e1nd\u00e1rs or commandants of posts, and stationed at Thar\u00e1d, V\u00e1v, Diodar, S\u00e1ntalpur, V\u00e1r\u00e1hi, and K\u00e1nkrej.\n\nIn P\u00e1lanpur, under the Diw\u00e1n, the chief judicial officers are the minister, mukh\u00ed k\u00e1rbh\u00e1ri; the judge of the appellate court, appeal ny\u00e1y\u00e1dhish; the civil judge, div\u00e1ni ny\u00e1y\u00e1dhish; and the criminal judge, fan\u00fajd\u00e1ri ny\u00e1y\u00e1dhish. At Deesa and Dhanera are officers with limited revenue, civil, and criminal powers. The criminal judge can pass sentences up to five years' imprisonment and \u00a3100 (Rs. 1000) fine. In any case calling for severer punishment, he passes sentence after confirmation by the chief or huzur court. The Deesa criminal judge may imprison up to six months and fine up to \u00a35 (Rs. 50). Capital offences are tried with the aid of assessors. The P\u00e1lanpur civil judge can dispose of suits to any value, the Deesa civil judge up to \u00a3100 (Rs. 1000), and the Dhanera civil judge up to \u00a350 (Rs. 500). Appeals from these two courts lie to the courts of the civil and criminal judges at P\u00e1lanpur, from them again an appeal lies to the court of appeal at P\u00e1lanpur, and finally to the Diw\u00e1n's court. Caste disputes, marriage and divorce questions, and points about land and house property are settled by committees, panch\u00e1yats. At R\u00e1dhanpur there is a High Court, Sadar Ad\u00e1lat, which exercises full powers both in civil and criminal cases, subject in criminal matters to confirmation by the Naw\u00e1b. This court, composed of four of the head managers, k\u00e1rbh\u00e1ris, and a kinsman of the Naw\u00e1b, hears appeals from all other courts. From the High Court a final appeal lies to the Naw\u00e1b. There are two other courts; the civil court, div\u00e1ni ad\u00e1lat, having full powers in all civil cases, and the criminal, fan\u00fajd\u00e1ri ad\u00e1lat, with power to try all offences punishable with imprisonment up to fourteen years, to impose any amount of fine, and to whip up to sixty stripes. There are civil and criminal courts at Sami and Munjipur; the former with jurisdiction over all cases up to \u00a310 (Rs. 100), and the latter with power to imprison for three months, fine up to \u00a35 (Rs. 50), and whip up to twelve stripes. At Balodhan there is a criminal court which can imprison up to one month, fine up to \u00a32 (Rs. 20), and whip up to six stripes. The commandants of posts, th\u00e1nd\u00e1rs, have authority to\nimprison up to eight days and fine up to 10s. (Rs. 5). Besides the above, at R\u00e1dhanpur a court hears cases in which subjects of foreign states are concerned, or which have been received through the Political Superintendent. Arbitrators are occasionally appointed to settle caste disputes. The Th\u00e1kor of Thar\u00e1d has the powers of a magistrate of the first class, and hears civil suits up to \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000) in value. Residuary jurisdiction in Thar\u00e1d is vested in the Political Superintendent whose court is the court of appeal from that of the Th\u00e1kor.\n\nThe R\u00e1na of V\u00e1v has second class magisterial powers, and in civil matters can hear cases up to \u00a350 (Rs. 500). The Th\u00e1kors of Diodar, Terv\u00e1da, and Bh\u00e1r\u00f3l have the powers of third class magistrates and can hear civil suits up to \u00a325 (Rs. 250). Besides these, the petty chiefs of S\u00e1ntalpur, Dua, Naroli, and V\u00e1r\u00e1hi have, on condition of employing competent officials, been invested, the first two with both civil and criminal powers to try suits up to \u00a325 (Rs. 250) and to award imprisonment up to one month, and fine up to \u00a35 (Rs. 50), and the remaining chiefs with powers to imprison up to one month, and fine up to \u00a32 10s. (Rs. 25). As these chiefs have not yet (October, 1879) employed competent officials, they have not begun to exercise their powers. Except in the estates of chiefs invested with civil and criminal powers, jurisdiction is exercised by six commandants of posts, th\u00e1nd\u00e1rs, stationed at Thar\u00e1d, V\u00e1v, Diodar, S\u00e1ntalpur, V\u00e1r\u00e1hi, and K\u00e1nkrej, who have third class magisterial powers and hear suits up to \u00a325 (Rs. 250). The first three of these th\u00e1nd\u00e1rs are under the senior native assistant superintendent, and the last three under the junior native assistant superintendent, who exercise the powers of a divisional and of a second class magistrate. The assistant superintendents can also award imprisonment up to one year subject to confirmation by the Political Superintendent, and they can commit cases to the Sessions Court. In civil matters they can dispose of suits to any value. The Political Superintendent exercises the powers of a District Magistrate and of a Sessions Judge in criminal matters, and hears appeals from the decisions of the th\u00e1nd\u00e1rs, the native assistants, and from the chiefs who have limited civil and criminal powers. As a Sessions Judge the Political Superintendent can award any punishment, sentences of death and of over seven years\u2019 imprisonment being subject to the confirmation of Government. Except in cases cognizable by a small cause court or in suits relating to movable property when he confirms the award of the lower court, an appeal against the decisions of the Political Superintendent lies to the Commissioner, Northern Division in criminal, and to Government in civil and political cases.\n\nIn P\u00e1lanpur in suits for the recovery of debt, the period of limitation is fifteen years. When a suit is filed a fee of 3\u00bd per cent is levied. In disputes regarding lands, houses, and caste differences, a fee of 2s. (Rs. 1) is charged at the outset and on settlement various additional fees are levied. In R\u00e1dhanpur the limitation rules are, for civil suits, eight years for the recovery of money lent on a bond; six years for money due on an account; and sixty years\nfor the redemption of mortgaged immovable property. Institution fees are taken on all suits and on appeals at the following rates: 7\u00bd per cent on claims up to \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000); 6\u00bc per cent on claims up to \u00a32000 (Rs. 20,000); and 5 per cent on claims above \u00a32000 (Rs. 20,000). In divorce suits when the divorce is granted, a fee of 10s. (Rs. 5) is levied. When the parties are Musalm\u00e1ns the K\u00e1zi takes the fee.\n\nBoth in P\u00e1l\u00e1npur and R\u00e1dhanpur written codes of civil and criminal procedure were introduced in 1875-76. From the decisions of the P\u00e1l\u00e1npur and R\u00e1dhanpur chiefs no appeal lies to the Political Superintendent, except in tracking-compensation, pagla valtar, cases. But if a representation is made, the Political Superintendent asks for the record of the case and if justice has not been done, the state agents, vakils, are advised to have the decision reconsidered. The procedure in the courts of Thar\u00e1d and other petty states is with some modifications based on the codes in force in British districts.\n\nFor police purposes in the city of P\u00e1l\u00e1npur and in each large town of the state is an officer, jam\u00e1d\u00e1r, with a certain number of constables; and in each village there is a police patel with a few watchmen, chauki\u00e1ts. Small detachments of horse, sav\u00e1rs, are placed in suitable villages to keep order through the state. The Political Superintendent has for this purpose at his disposal a body of 150 horse and 100 footmen, called the P\u00e1l\u00e1npur levy subsidised by the state. The village watch are Rajputs, Kolis, Th\u00e1kard\u00e1s, and Bhils, and are usually paid by a grant of service, pas\u00fata, land, supplemented, in some cases, with monthly cash payments, varying from 2s. to 10s. (Re. 1-5). Besides the watch there is, in each village, a messenger, hav\u00e1ld\u00e1r, whose special duty it is to prevent cultivators from taking away their crops before the state share has been fixed. The ordinary village police system is in force throughout R\u00e1dhanpur. The headman of each village is a police patel who has under him a certain number of watchmen, chauki\u00e1ts, paid by grants of rent-free land. The village police patels and watch of each sub-division are under the superintendence of a sub-divisional police officer, and all the sub-divisional officers are under the chief police officer, of the state. In some of the villages small outposts of mounted police, sav\u00e1rs, are stationed. The village police system is in force throughout the smaller states. Each village has its police patel, watchmen, and trackers, pag\u00eds, paid by grants of rent-free land and sometimes in cash and grain, usually at the cost of the villagers. Small bodies of the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r\u2019s horse are posted in some of the more disorderly villages.\n\nBoth at P\u00e1l\u00e1npur and at R\u00e1dhanpur there are jails, the P\u00e1l\u00e1npur jail with room for 300, and the R\u00e1dhanpur with room for 250 prisoners. Persons convicted by the Superintendent and his assistants are at present sent to the P\u00e1l\u00e1npur jail. But a new jail to accommodate from 100 to 150 prisoners and to cost about \u00a32500 (Rs. 25,000) is under construction. In P\u00e1l\u00e1npur villages police patels have, for petty offences such as slight assault, power to fine up to 2s. 6d. (Rs. 1-4-0). In more important cases, it is usual to issue warrants and summons.\nWhen the P\u00e1lanpur territories came under British supervision it was found that the J\u00e1dej\u00e1s of S\u00e1ntalpur and Ch\u00e1dchat were in the habit of killing their children. In 1828 Colonel Miles, the Political Superintendent, obtained agreements promising to abolish the crime. A return furnished in 1850 showed a marked disproportion between the number of boys and girls. Precautions similar to those taken in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r were introduced and have since been maintained. The latest (1879) returns show that the numbers, 700 girls and 760 boys, are nearly equal. Female infants still suffer from want of care, but cases of wilful murder are believed to have ceased.\nCHAPTER X.\n\nREVENUE AND FINANCE.\n\nIn 1877-78 the gross revenue of the Palanpur Superintendency was returned at \u00a3124,185 (Rs. 12,41,850). It is drawn from four chief sources, land, salt, customs and transit dues, and miscellaneous cesses. The following statement gives the leading details:\n\nPalanpur States, Revenue Abstract, 1877-78.\n\n| State                  | Land | Salt | Customs and Transit | Cesses | Miscellaneous | Total |\n|------------------------|------|------|---------------------|--------|---------------|-------|\n|                        | \u00a3    | \u00a3    | \u00a3                   | \u00a3      | \u00a3             | \u00a3     |\n| Palanpur               | 18,903 | 204  | 6117                | 5,924  | 3,480         | 33,873 |\n| Diwan's private villages | 654   |      |                     | 143    |               | 1,147 |\n| Bhayad villages        | 3,105 |      |                     | 1,553  |               | 4,658 |\n| Radhanpur              | 37,755 | 1,104| 7,462               | 4,494  | 3,206         | 54,051 |\n| Tharad                 | 1,452 | 18   | 1,281               | 507    | *142*         | 4,623 |\n| Tharad Jumma villages  | 3,201 |      | 670                 | 943    | 1,155         | 5,309 |\n| Vav and Vav Baza       | 960   | 29   | 162                 | 348    | 250           | 1,588 |\n| Sulgam, Vav Bhayad and Sulgam | 2,229 | 60   | 319                 | 99     | 66            | 2,773 |\n| Diodar, Tervada, and Bhabhar | 2,480 |      | 470                 | 711    | 30            | 3,691 |\n| Santalpur              | 1,982 | 10   | 267                 | 30     | 55            | 2,344 |\n| Chandialat             | 402   | 10   | 111                 | 6      | 5             | 538   |\n| Moradga               | 125   |      | 24                  | 1      | 2             | 152   |\n| Varahi                 | 3,842 | 10   | 143                 | 687    | 210           | 4,922 |\n| Kankrej                | 2,836 |      | 496                 | 2,399  | 344           | 6,075 |\n\nTotal... 79,886 1445 17,470 16,707 9,177 124,185\n\n* Of this \u00a3256 are received from Giravida.\n\nPalanpur, and the collection of small holdings contained in the Kankrej division, are the only two states that pay tribute. The Palanpur state pays a yearly tribute of \u00a35000 (Rs. 50,000) to the Gaikwar, and the Kankrej state pays the Gaikwar \u00a3500 (Rs. 5000) yearly, \u00a3365 (Rs. 3650) as cesses, ghasdana, and \u00a3136 (Rs. 1360) as rental, jamma. Cash received is lodged with a banker under the superintendence of the minister, mukhi karbhari, and all tribute and administrative charges are met by drawing on this deposit. Money realized by the sale of land for building purposes, from succession and appointment fees, nazars, due to the Diwan, and the revenue of two villages set apart for his use, form the private income of the head of the state. These are credited to the private treasury, tosha khana, account. In Radhanpur the revenue is paid into the treasury in the Nawab's palace at Radhanpur, and the balance after all expenses have been met is paid into the\n\n1 Nazars are levied on new year's day, on the appointment of village patels, and whenever the chief incurs travelling or other extraordinary expense.\nNaw\u00e1b\u2019s private treasury, *tosha kh\u00e1na*. Besides this balance, fees, *nazars*, and the revenue of certain villages set apart for his use go to make up the chief\u2019s private income. The revenues of certain villages managed by the Naw\u00e1b\u2019s brothers and other members of his family are enjoyed by them as private income. The Thar\u00e1d revenue is lodged with a banker under the direct supervision of the state manager, *k\u00e1rth\u00e1ri*. The R\u00e1na of V\u00e1v also lodges the revenue of his estate with a banker. In the K\u00e1nkrej estates the cash proceeds of the revenue are lodged with the village accountants, *tal\u00e1t\u00eds*, who, after paying the tribute and police charges, divide the surplus between the shareholders. The petty chiefs of the other states keep their revenue in their own houses, or lodge it with their managers, *k\u00e1md\u00e1rs*.\n\nP\u00e1l\u00e1npur transit dues, and import and export duties are levied at different rates in its several sub-divisions, *pargan\u00e1s*. The yearly income derived from these sources amounts to about \u00a31404 (Rs. 14,040) from transit; \u00a3940 (Rs. 9400) from import, and \u00a31300 (Rs. 13,000) from export, duties; also \u00a32540 (Rs. 25,400) and \u00a3204 (Rs. 2040) from duties levied on opium and salt respectively. Some minor cesses such as a conveyance cess,\u00b9 and a toll, *n\u00e1ka*, are, in addition to transit duties, levied in the districts of Deesa, Dhanera, Dhandar, Dantiv\u00e1da, H\u00e1thedra, and P\u00e1vti. Toll men, *n\u00e1ked\u00e1rs*, are employed by the chiefs, and traders have to pay watchmen, *chaukh\u00e1ts*, to guard their goods. If a guard is paid for, the state is held responsible for the safety of the goods and has to pay compensation for robberies committed within, or traced into, its limits. In the four sub-divisions, *mah\u00e1ls*, of the R\u00e1dhanpur state, R\u00e1dhanpur, Sami, Munjpur, and Balodhan, transit dues and duties on the import and export of goods are levied, but only once during transit through the state. Transit duties are also levied by this state at the following places beyond its borders: Kill\u00e1na, Jhagham, Charanka, Terv\u00e1da, and Jhandada. In Thar\u00e1d and other small estates transit, import, and export dues are levied, but only once during passage through each state. The dues are gathered by toll men, *n\u00e1ked\u00e1rs*. Only in Thar\u00e1d is a guard of foot and horse kept to protect traffic. In other states traders and travellers have to provide themselves with an escort, which may always be had for a small payment. If robbed while thus escorted, travellers are entitled to receive compensation from the chief in whose territory they have been attacked, or from the chief into whose territory the footsteps of the robbers have been traced and cannot be followed further. In the states under the direct management of the Political Superintendent, detachments of the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r\u2019s contingent patrol all the year round to ensure, as far as possible, the safety of the principal roads.\n\nIn P\u00e1l\u00e1npur, besides the land tax, the lands of the state yield certain minor items of revenue such as cattle, *puchhi*, and grazing, *char\u00e1i*,\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 This called the ass cess, *gadd\u00ed*, is a small tax levied by certain persons not on the value of the goods but according to the number of conveyances.\nfees. The cattle, *puchhi*, literally tail, cess is, at varying rates, levied from Rabaris, Kanbis, artisans, and others for grazing cattle. The grazing, *charai*, fee is levied from outsiders, who bring herds of cattle and camels to graze within its limits. Of non-agricultural cesses there are taxes on oil presses, *ghani*, on shoemakers, *saladis*, and on weavers, *s\u00e1lvis*. There is also a tax on liquor stills and a house tax levied from Vani\u00e1s, artisans, and others. In R\u00e1dhanpur the minor cesses are much the same as in P\u00e1lanpur; a plough-tax, the two classes of residents' and outsiders' grazing fees, and most of the non-agricultural cesses. Tharad and the other petty states levy grazing fees and cesses on oil presses, shoemakers, horned cattle, marriages, houses, and water. Craftsmen work for the chief without wages; in return some of them are freed from the payment of taxes.\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nINSTRUCTION.\n\nIn the whole Superintendency there were, in 1878-79, twenty-two schools, twenty-one for boys and one for girls, with a total attendance of 1153 pupils. Under the Director of public instruction and the Education Inspector, northern division, the schooling of the Superintendency was in 1878-79 conducted by a local staff sixty strong. Of these, one was a deputy inspector, two were headmasters of English schools drawing yearly \u00a360 (Rs. 600); the rest were masters of Gujarati schools with yearly salaries varying from \u00a336 (Rs. 360) to \u00a32 8s. (Rs. 24). Of twenty-two the total number of schools, in nineteen Gujarati only was taught, in two English, and in one Persian and Urdu.\n\nTwenty years ago (1859) there were in the Superintendency six schools with a total attendance of 281 pupils. Of these the P\u00e1lanpur and R\u00e1dhanpur schools were maintained by those states at a cost of \u00a3117 (Rs. 1170) and \u00a322 (Rs. 220) respectively. The V\u00e1r\u00e1hi school was supported by a shareholder of that state at a cost of \u00a314 (Rs. 140), and the Th\u00e1ra school was kept up from the Fine Fund, since termed the P\u00e1lanpur Agency General Fund. In 1864-65 the number of schools remained the same, but the total attendance increased to 388. The figures for 1878-79 are, as shown above, twenty-two schools with a total attendance of 1153 pupils. Compared with those for 1859-60 these figures give a nearly fourfold increase in the number of schools and of pupils. Of 1168, the total attendance in Government and aided private schools, there were in 1878-79, 110 or 9\u00b74 per cent Br\u00e1hmans, 5 K\u00e1yasths, 556 or 47\u00b76 per cent Jains, 80 or 6\u00b78 per cent V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, traders, and 39 or 3\u00b73 per cent shopkeepers, 32 or 2\u00b77 per cent Rajputs, 35 or 2\u00b79 per cent cultivators, 91 or 7\u00b77 per cent artisans, 6 labourers, 5 Mochis, shoemakers, and 41 or 3\u00b75 per cent miscellaneous; 164 or 14\u00b704 per cent Musalm\u00e1ns, 36 of them Bohor\u00e1s, 37 Memans, 84 Miy\u00e1n\u00e1s, and 7 Moghals. Four of the pupils were P\u00e1rsis.\n\nIn P\u00e1lanpur there are nine vernacular schools for boys and one for girls, a Persian school, and a second grade Anglo-vernacular school. During 1878-79 the number of pupils on the rolls was 592 and the average attendance 459, the fee receipts \u00a325 (Rs. 250), and the yearly charges \u00a3399 (Rs. 3990). There are in R\u00e1dhanpur one Anglo-vernacular and four vernacular schools. During 1878-79 the number of boys on the rolls was 295, the average attendance 200, and the yearly charges \u00a3112 (Rs. 1120). There are boys'\nvernacular schools at Thar\u00e1d, V\u00e1v, V\u00e1r\u00e1hi, S\u00e1ntalpur, and at Thara in the K\u00e1nkrej division. The school at Thar\u00e1d is kept by the Thakor at a yearly cost of \u00a327 (Rs. 270). Teaching up to the sixth standard, it is attended by forty pupils. The school at V\u00e1v is supported by the R\u00e1na at a yearly cost of \u00a322 14s. (Rs. 227). Teaching up to the fifth standard, it is attended by 97 pupils. The school at V\u00e1r\u00e1hi, is at a yearly cost of \u00a318 12s. (Rs. 186) supported by a shareholder of V\u00e1r\u00e1hi. Teaching up to the fifth standard, it is attended by 55 pupils or 1\u00b765 per cent of 3337, the entire population of the town. The school at S\u00e1ntalpur is supported by the T\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs of that place, at a yearly cost of \u00a315 12s. (Rs. 156). It is attended by thirty pupils or 2\u00b704 per cent of 1474 the population of the village. The school at Thara is paid for out of the K\u00e1nkrej th\u00e1na fund. The charges amount to \u00a325 2s. (Rs. 251). It is attended by forty-four pupils.\n\nIn this Superintendency there are two libraries, but no local newspaper. The \u2018Native General Library\u2019 at P\u00e1lanpur was established in 1872. Besides fourteen subscribers paying \u00a35 8s. (Rs. 54) a year, the library has for its maintenance a fund of \u00a3350 (Rs. 3500). With no building of its own, the library is provided with eighty-eight English and 308 vernacular books. The \u2018Bismilla Kh\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur\u2019s Library\u2019 at R\u00e1dhanpur, established in 1878 at the cost of the R\u00e1dhanpur Naw\u00e1b, in a well furnished building, has 161 English and vernacular books.\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nHEALTH.\u00b9\n\nIn the year 1815-16 the districts of R\u00e1dhanpur, Sami, and Munjpur were visited by a disease very like plague and so fatal that it carried off about one-half of the population. The disease appeared under two forms, one with swellings in the arm-pits and groin, and the other with fever and spitting of blood. Except when the buboes suppurred and discharged freely, the patient seldom recovered. The same disease again appeared in 1820 at and near R\u00e1dhanpur. No treatment proved of any avail. Formerly cholera and small-pox almost yearly visited the district, but of late years the outbreaks have been less frequent. About the year 1843 an epidemic of cholera coming from Sidhpur in P\u00e1tan, lasted for about three months. Four years later (1847) there was another outbreak caused, it was thought, by excessive rain. The disease again visited the district in 1860 and 1864, the 1864 outbreak being specially severe in the Dhanera and Deesa sub-divisions of the P\u00e1lapur state. Five years later (1869) cholera again appeared and raged for about three months. It was again prevalent both in 1875 and 1876. In 1878 (September - October) typhoid fever with choleraic symptoms prevailed amongst the European troops in the Deesa camp, and in the hot season of 1879 it again broke out in some parts of the district. Of 689 cases reported, 335 were fatal. A very fatal epidemic of small-pox and measles raged in the district in 1854-55, and another in 1877.\n\nFever, one of the commonest diseases, is very prevalent from the middle of September to December. Besides the common yearly fever there are occasional more fatal outbreaks. These epidemics, accompanied with cough, diarrhoea, vomiting, and swelling of the feet were specially severe in 1862, 1865, 1871 and 1879. In 1872 dengue fever was very prevalent over the whole district. Next to fevers, chiefly in the cold weather, bronchitis and other affections of the chest are the commonest complaints. Other prevailing diseases are derangements of the digestive organs, and different forms of skin and eye affections.\n\nIn 1878-79 there were two dispensaries, at P\u00e1lapur and R\u00e1dhanpur. The P\u00e1lapur dispensary is under the charge of an assistant surgeon, who is also in medical charge of the superintend-\n\n\u00b9 Contributed by Mr. Manil\u00e1l Gang\u00e1d\u00e1s Des\u00e1i, Assistant Surgeon.\nency establishment and the jail. The cost of the dispensary is met by the Diw\u00e1n of P\u00e1lanpur and the charges for the superintendency establishment and prisoners by Government. The total number of patients treated during the year was, including in-patients, 9897. Of these 5835 were Hindus, 4002 Musalm\u00e1ns, and 36 P\u00e1rsis. The R\u00e1dhanpur dispensary was established in 1875 by the Naw\u00e1b of R\u00e1dhanpur. It is under the charge of an hospital assistant. The total number of patients treated during the year 1877 was 4454, of whom 2891 were Hindus and 1563 Musalm\u00e1ns.\n\nThe Diw\u00e1n of P\u00e1lanpur introduced vaccination in his state in 1849. In 1878-79, under the superintendent of vaccination seven vaccinators operated on 15,150 persons at a cost of \u00a3186 (Rs. 1860) or about 3d. (2 annas) a head. In the town of P\u00e1lanpur are five local practitioners, three of them Hindus and two Musalm\u00e1ns.\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nSTATES.\u00b9\n\nPa'lanpur, with its three divisions, Dh\u00e1nd\u00e1r, Deesa, and Dh\u00e1nera, stretches about forty-five miles north and south from mount \u00c1bu to the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r districts of P\u00e1tan, and about sixty miles east and west from Virampur to Thar\u00e1d. It is bounded on the north by M\u00e1rw\u00e1r and Sirohi; on the east by Sirohi and D\u00e1nta in the Mahi K\u00e1ntha; on the south by the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r districts of P\u00e1tan and Kher\u00e1l\u00fa; and on the west by Diodar and Thar\u00e1d. The total area is 2384 square miles, the 1872 population 215,972 souls or on an average 90\u00b759 to the square mile, and the estimated gross revenue in 1878 about \u00a340,000 (Rs. 4,00,000).\n\nNear the town of P\u00e1lanpur the land rises in rows of sandy hillocks; to the north and east among the outliers of the Ar\u00e1vali hills the country is wild and rough; and west towards Thar\u00e1d and K\u00e1nkrej it is a level plain much of it covered with low brushwood. About twelve miles north of P\u00e1lanpur, a range of high hills begins, and, running nearly north to mount \u00c1bu, partly divides P\u00e1lanpur from Sirohi.\n\nExcept in September and October, the climate is good, though the heat at times is excessive. The maximum and mean ranges of the thermometer, is, in January 72\u00b0 and 59\u00b0, in May 99\u00b0 and 83\u00b0, in September 83\u00b0 and 72\u00b0, and in December 65\u00b0 and 63\u00b0. The rains are due about the end of June, but are often as late as the middle of July; they set in and pass away with slight storms of thunder and lightning. The average rainfall is about eighteen inches. The common complaints are skin diseases, diarrhoea, fevers, eye affections, rheumatism, small-pox, measles, and cholera. A vaccinator was first appointed in 1849 and since then steady progress has been made.\n\nThe rivers that water the P\u00e1lanpur territory are the Ban\u00e1s, the Sarasvati, the Umardaki, and some small streams. They all rise from the mountains in the north-east, and, flowing west, fall into or disappear near the Ran. The chief of them, the Ban\u00e1s, on whose\n\n\u00b9 The states are arranged according to their size and wealth,\nleft bank is the Deesa cantonment, fills only after very heavy rain and is at other times dry. The wells are generally forty feet deep, but, owing to drought or other causes, the water level has, of late years, sunk to from fifty to seventy-five feet. For the crops water is usually raised in the leather bag, kos.\n\nTo the north and west the soil is light and sandy, wanting little water but most of it yielding only one crop a year; to the south and east, towards the hills, it is a rich black, able, in one year, with a good rainfall, to raise three crops.\n\nP\u00e1lanpur in early times is said to have been called Pralh\u00e1dan P\u00e1tan, and to have been founded by Pralh\u00e1dan Dev, brother of Dh\u00e1r\u00e1varsh Parm\u00e1r of Chandr\u00e1vati; it is said to have been desolate two centuries before the beginning of the Samvat era (57 B.C.). It was afterwards re-peopled by P\u00e1lansi Choh\u00e1n from whom it took its modern name. Others say that it was founded by P\u00e1l Parm\u00e1r whose brother Jagdev founded Jag\u00e1na. It seems probable that, falling waste about the time of the conquest (1303) of \u00c1bu and Chandr\u00e1vati by the Devra Choh\u00e1ns, it may have been re-peopled by P\u00e1lansi. The Choh\u00e1ns seem to have held P\u00e1lanpur and the country round till, about the middle of the fourteenth century, they were driven out by the southward progress of the Musalm\u00e1ns. The Musalm\u00e1n leaders who conquered P\u00e1lanpur and Deesa were the Jh\u00e1loris, a family originally of the Loh\u00e1ni Afgh\u00e1n stock, who claim to have been governors, subh\u00e1s, of Vih\u00e1r. About 1370 Malik Yusuf, the head of the family, with relations and retainers, left Vih\u00e1r to seek a settlement elsewhere and failing this to go to Mecca. On the way to Mecca, he and his party came to Songad Jh\u00e1lor, the famous seat of the Songad Choh\u00e1ns of whom K\u00e1nar Dev is a favourite Rajput hero. This, about 1373, Malik Yusuf took, some say from Viramdev, some from Visaldev, and most from Popanb\u00e1i, Visaldev\u2019s widow. Dying in 1395 (797 H.), after ruling for twenty-two years, Malik Yusuf was succeeded by his son Malik Hasan, who enlarged his kingdom and was recognised by the Emperor as the ruler of Jh\u00e1lor.\n\nWhile the Tughlik dynasty (1325-1403) lasted, the Jh\u00e1loris, though almost independent, were their vassals under the control of the Subh\u00e1d\u00e1r at P\u00e1tan. After Timur\u2019s invasion (1389), the Delhi sovereigns were unable to control their distant provinces, and the Jh\u00e1loris for a time became independent. But soon (1412) the powerful kings of Ahmedabad asserted their sway, and the Jh\u00e1lor house became their vassals, serving them with 7000 horse.\n\nAfter a reign of forty-five years Malik Hassan died in 1440 (19th Zilkaad 843 H.) leaving three sons, Malik S\u00e1l\u00e1r, Malik Usm\u00e1n, and Hetam Kh\u00e1n. Of these the eldest, Malik S\u00e1l\u00e1r, succeeded, and ruling for twenty-one years died in 1461 (865 H.). Malik S\u00e1l\u00e1r was succeeded by his brother Malik Usm\u00e1n, also called Malik Jabdal, a chief famous for his magnificence, who was converted to the Mehdaviyyah sect to which the Jh\u00e1loris have since belonged. It is said that the founder\n\n---\n\n1 The local legends give the city a much higher antiquity, placing its re-founding under its present name as far back as the fifth century.\nof this sect stayed for four months at Jhalor, and that it was on this occasion that Malik Jabdal was converted. After a reign of twenty-two years Malik Usman was, in 1483 (888 H.), succeeded by his nephew Malik Budhan, son of Salar Khan. Malik Budhan reigned for twenty-two years and seven months, and, dying in 1505 (911 H.), was succeeded by his son Malik Mujahid Khan. Once, when hunting, Malik Mujahid Khan was surprised and carried prisoner to Sirohi. He was treated with great kindness, given a palace to live in, and as much luxury as he chose. In revenge for his capture Maliks Mina and Piara, the leaders of his forces, ravaged the Sirohi districts, and one night making their way to the palace where Malik Mujahid was confined, found him enjoying the society of a beautiful courtezan. He refused to leave the lady and the Maliks returned disappointed. Shortly after, they succeeded in capturing Kunvar Mandan, the heir to Sirohi, while he was sitting at night over a forest pool waiting for game. Threatening to make the Kunvar a Muhammadan, the Jhaloris so frightened the Rao, that he not only set Malik Mujahid free but ceded to him the district of Virgam.\n\nAfter ruling at Jhalor for five years Malik Mujahid died in 1509 (915 H.). While Mujahid was in captivity at Sirohi, Malik Hetam Khan ruled in Jhalor. After Mujahid Khan's death Sultan Mahmud Begada entrusted the rule of Jhalor and Sacher to Shah Jiva son of Balu Khan. Dying in 1512 (918 H.), he was succeeded by Malik Ali Sher, son of Budhan Khan Jhalori. During Malik Ali Sher's rule, the Rathods of Mandovar in Malva advanced against Jhalor, forced their way close to the city, and were with difficulty driven back, after a three days fight. Dying in 1525 (931 H.), Ali Sher was followed by his son Malik Sikandar Khan, who, like his father, suffered from the attacks of his Hindu neighbours. In 1542 (949 H.), Rao Maldev of Jodhpur besieged, took, and plundered Jhalor, and, in the next year (1543), took and plundered Sacher. Dying in 1555 (955 H.), Malik Sikandar was succeeded by Malik Ghazni Khan, son of Hetam Khan, who, during a reign of two years, restored the power of the Jhalori family, and was succeeded by Malik Khani, a man of great bravery and of prodigious personal strength. In 1555 (962 H.), five years after the death of Ghazni Khan, Fateh Khan Baloch of Tervada and Radhanpur, one of the most powerful of the Gujarat nobles, marched against Jhalor. Maliks Khani and Khuram Khan joined battle with the Baloch force before Jhalor. But, in spite of the greatest bravery on the part of its defenders, Jhalor was taken and Khuram Khan slain. For fifteen years the Baloch held Jhalor. Then, 1570 (977 H.), Malik Khani, gathering some followers, came against the city. They found the garrison ready to meet them and strengthened by an elephant of great size. Malik Khani called to his men: 'There are two foes, the elephant and the garrison, which shall I take.' 'Elephant,' said they, 'should go against elephant,' and Malik rushing forward and wounding his foe, it turned to fly, threw the defenders into disorder, and lost them the day.\n\n1 Khaim-us-Suliman, Part II. In Part I. it is said that Malik Jabdal was succeeded by his brother Hetam Khan. Major J. W. Watson.\nMalik Kh\u00e1nji died in 1576 (984 H.). He left two sons Ghazni Kh\u00e1n and Firoz Kh\u00e1n, and a daughter named T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1\u00ed. He was succeeded by Ghazni Kh\u00e1n, who, according to the Mir\u00e1t-i-Ahmadi, served the state with 7000 horse, and had a revenue of about \u00a3100,000. Attempting to raise north Gujar\u00e1t on behalf of Sult\u00e1n Muzaffar, he was imprisoned by Akbar\u2019s order, but, afterwards submitting, was in 1589-90 reinstated at Jh\u00e1lor. Seven years later (1597), according to the P\u00e1lanpur records, Ghazni Kh\u00e1n driving back an invasion of the Afghan tribes, received the title of Diw\u00e1n and the government of L\u00e1h\u00f3r.\n\nDuring his rule Ghazni Kh\u00e1n\u2019s brother, Malik Firoz Kh\u00e1n took P\u00e1lanpur and Deesa, establishing himself at P\u00e1lanpur. Ghazni Kh\u00e1n, dying in 1614 (1023 H.), was succeeded by his son Pah\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n, who, found guilty of matricide, was, in 1616, by the Emperor\u2019s orders, trampled to death by an elephant. After Pah\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n came his uncle Malik Firoz Kh\u00e1n, also called Kam\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n, a distinguished soldier, who, and his son Malik Muj\u00e1hid Kh\u00e1n, greatly enlarged the family estate, and, it is said, obtained the title of Naw\u00e1b. Under prince Mur\u00e1d Baksh, Muj\u00e1hid Kh\u00e1n was, in 1654, appointed governor jaujdar, of P\u00e1tan. Twenty years later (1674) his father Kam\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n, who had been removed from the government of P\u00e1lanpur, was restored to his former post. In 1697 Muj\u00e1hid Kh\u00e1n was sent to levy the capitation tax from the Hindus of P\u00e1lanpur and Jh\u00e1lor, and, in 1699, the government of Jh\u00e1lor and S\u00e1chor was taken from him and given to Ajitsing R\u00e1thod; Jh\u00e1lor was never recovered, and from that time the head-quarters of the family have been at P\u00e1lanpur. Dying without male issue, Muj\u00e1hid was succeeded by his brother Salim Kh\u00e1n, and he, in 1700, by his son Kam\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n. Kam\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n conducted the affairs of the chiefdom prosperously, and was succeeded in 1708 by his son Firoz Kh\u00e1n also called Ghazni Kh\u00e1n.\n\n---\n\n1 Bird\u2019s Gujar\u00e1t, 125. This, says Prof. Blochmann (\u00c1in-i-Akbari, I. 493, note 3), can only have been nominal.\n2 Bom. Gov. Sel. XXV. 15. This seems doubtful. The Muhammadans granted the title of Diw\u00e1n as a civil and not as a military distinction. Further, in the Persian histories of Gujar\u00e1t, the chiefs of Jh\u00e1lor or P\u00e1lanpur are nowhere mentioned by the title of Diw\u00e1n but always by the patronymic Jh\u00e1lori and the title Kh\u00e1n, or the prefix Malik. Thus Ghaznavi Kh\u00e1n Jh\u00e1lori and Muj\u00e1hid Kh\u00e1n Jh\u00e1lori, Malik Muj\u00e1hid Kh\u00e1n, but never Diw\u00e1n Muj\u00e1hid Kh\u00e1n or Diw\u00e1n Ghaznavi Kh\u00e1n. In the historic sketch of Thar\u00e1d it is noticed that Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n drove out Choh\u00e1n Jetmalji from Thar\u00e1d, and held that estate for several years. Now Diw\u00e1n is the title of the holder of the Thar\u00e1d estate, and, though not recognized by Government, it is used to this day by the Thar\u00e1d chief. In the disorders that followed the close of Aurangzeb\u2019s reign, not only were titles assumed to which those assuming them had no right, but many deeds, granting such titles, were forged. Nothing was easier than for Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n to keep the title of Diwan which he had assumed when ruling Thar\u00e1d, and this seems to be its true origin. Major J. W. Watson. In support of this it may be noticed that in 1595, after his supposed victory over the Afghans, the Jh\u00e1lor chief was only a commander, of 400, and no mention is made of distinguished services and honours. Blochmann\u2019s \u00c1in-i-Akbari, I. 493.\n3 According to one account P\u00e1lanpur and Deesa were acquired at this time either as a grant from the Viceroy or by force from the former chiefs. It seems, as stated in the text, more probable that P\u00e1lanpur was already in the possession of Muj\u00e1hid Kh\u00e1n\u2019s father.\n4 This account, the result of Major J. W. Watson\u2019s latest inquiries, differs in some details from that given in Bom. Gov. Sel. XXV. 15.\nAbout eight years later (1716) Ajitsing R\u00e1thod of Jodhpur was chosen Viceroy of Gujar\u00e1t, and, as he passed from Jh\u00e1lor to Ahmedabad, Firoz Kh\u00e1n went to meet him, and in return for an offer of service received the Sirohi district of D\u00e1ntav\u00e1da. In the anarchy that prevailed about this time (1720), the Jh\u00e1loris turned their thoughts to gain independence. On the death of Firoz Kh\u00e1n (about 1722) his two sons Kam\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n and Karimd\u00e1d Kh\u00e1n struggled for the chiefship. Karimd\u00e1d Kh\u00e1n won in the end and put his brother to death. During his viceroyalty of Gujar\u00e1t, Karimd\u00e1d accompanied R\u00e1thod Abhayising, Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja of Jodhpur, in his expedition against Sirohi, and won P\u00e1lanpur, Dh\u00e1n\u00e9ra, Mal\u00e1na, \u0160urbakri, D\u00e1bela, Roh, and Sarotra from Sirohi. Dying about 1730 he was succeeded by his son Pah\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n, who ruled until about 1744, when he died without male issue. During his rule, in 1736, Kant\u00e9ji Kadam and Malh\u00e1rr\u00e1v Holkar made a sudden descent on north Gujar\u00e1t and plundered P\u00e1lanpur, when the chief agreed to pay a tribute of \u00a310,000 (Rs. 1,00,000). On Pah\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n\u2019s death his uncle Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n, son of Firoz Kh\u00e1n, succeeded and continued in the chiefship till 1768. In 1753 Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n was forced by Patel Vithal \u0160akdev to agree to a yearly payment of \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000), and five years later (1758), the Peshwa\u2019s deputy, Sad\u00e1shiv R\u00e1mchandra, compelled him to pay a tribute of \u00a33500 (Rs. 35,000). He was succeeded by his son Salim Kh\u00e1n. Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n drove Choh\u00e1n Jetmalji of Dhema out of Thar\u00e1d and held this estate until dispossessed by Naw\u00e1b Kam\u00e1l-ud-din Kh\u00e1n B\u00e1bi, commonly known as Jaw\u00e1n Mard Kh\u00e1n II. Salim Kh\u00e1n ruled till 1781, when he died and was succeeded by his son Sher Kh\u00e1n, who killed his brothers fearing that they might compete with him for the chiefship. Sher Kh\u00e1n died without male issue in 1788. On his death his sister Sona Bubu, who had married into the B\u00e1bi family, raised her son Mub\u00e1riz Kh\u00e1n to the chiefship. The nobles displeased at her conduct, revolted and dethroning Mub\u00e1riz Kh\u00e1n placed Shamsher Kh\u00e1n on the throne. Firoz Kh\u00e1n, son of Fateh Kh\u00e1n, the grandson of Firoz Kh\u00e1n, now preferred his claim, and, the old vassals rallying round him, gained the chiefship in 1794. The state was, in 1809, brought in contact with the British Government, when an agreement was entered into by the chief to pay the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r a yearly tribute of \u00a34375 (B\u00e1b\u00e1\u0161k\u00e1i Rs. 50,001).\n\nFor some years, the chief power had been in the hands of a faction of Sindi Jam\u00e1d\u00e1rs, who, in 1812, under the suspicion that he was about to reduce their power, murdered Firoz Kh\u00e1n, when out hunting. They offered the succession to his only son Fateh Kh\u00e1n, then thirteen years old. Fateh Kh\u00e1n, by the advice of his mother, a woman of strong mind who well knew that her son would be a tool in the hands of the Jam\u00e1d\u00e1rs, refused the offer, and applied to the British and G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r Governments for help and protection from his\n\n---\n\n1 During his reign Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n built the P\u00e1lanpur city walls.

On this the Jam\u00e1d\u00e1rs seized and imprisoned him, and raised his uncle Shamsher Kh\u00e1n, then chief of the districts of Deesa and Dh\u00e1nera, to the chiefship. Meanwhile the British and G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r Governments deeming it necessary to interfere in favour of the rightful heir, Captain Carnac, the Resident at Baroda, with the British and G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r forces under the command of General Holmes, proceeded to P\u00e1lanpur to restore Fateh Kh\u00e1n. On the way news was brought that, on the approach of the force to P\u00e1lanpur, the Jam\u00e1d\u00e1rs intended to carry off Fateh Kh\u00e1n in order that his presence might give a sanction in the country to any lawless measures it might suit their interests to pursue. General Holmes, in the hope of preventing the carrying off of Fateh Kh\u00e1n, marched at once to P\u00e1lanpur and threatened to assault the town unless Fateh Kh\u00e1n was immediately given up. This threat caused the surrender of Fateh Kh\u00e1n, which was shortly followed by that of Shamsher Kh\u00e1n, and the town was given up, the Jam\u00e1d\u00e1rs flying to the hills.\n\nAfter much discussion regarding Shamsher Kh\u00e1n's claims, it was decided to consolidate the interests of the rival claimants. On the 22nd December 1813, Fateh Kh\u00e1n was invested with the chiefship of P\u00e1lanpur, and Shamsher Kh\u00e1n, having no issue, adopted him, and, except a small provision for a son of his own should one be born, made him heir to all his possessions including Deesa and Dh\u00e1nera. It was also arranged that Shamsher Kh\u00e1n should manage the state and give his daughter in marriage to Fateh Kh\u00e1n. From this to 1816 was a time of constant dissensions between the uncle and nephew. About the end of 1816, Fateh Kh\u00e1n complained to the Resident at Baroda of his uncle's conduct in alienating the revenues of the state and other mismanagement. Lieutenant Robertson was sent to P\u00e1lanpur to inquire into the grievances complained of. Both the parties were summoned to Sidhpur, about eighteen miles from P\u00e1lanpur, and a long inquiry showed that Shamsher Kh\u00e1n had, in several instances, departed from his agreement, and that since his management the debts of the state had greatly increased, that since 1813 the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r tribute of \u00a34375 (B\u00e1b\u00e1sh\u00e1i Rs. 50,000) a year had remained unpaid, and that he had, without the consent of Fateh Kh\u00e1n, alienated about 100 villages to his own distant relations thereby depriving the state of nearly \u00a35000 (Rs. 50,000), or upwards of one-fifth of the yearly revenue. The Agent also learnt that Shamsher Kh\u00e1n had threatened to take the life of the young chief, should he be deprived of the management of affairs. Lieutenant Robertson, having received instructions from the Resident, addressed a letter to Shamsher Kh\u00e1n, in the name of the British Government, informing him that in consequence of his having failed in administering the affairs of the state according to his agreement, it was deemed essential, in order to secure the rights and interests of Fateh Kh\u00e1n, to deprive him of all authority. He was also told that any resistance to this measure would deprive him of all claim to consideration and the chance of retaining his authority over Deesa. On receiving this letter,\n\n---\n\n1 Aitchison's Treaties (1876), IV.47-52, XX.\nShamsher Kh\u00e1n, as a last resource, opened communication with Fateh Kh\u00e1n trying to persuade him that the British Government wished to benefit itself at their expense and that Fateh Kh\u00e1n would merely become their pensioner. He also promised at once to marry his daughter to him, a measure so long delayed by their quarrels. This had the desired effect. Fateh Kh\u00e1n, in company with Shamsher Kh\u00e1n, secretly left the Agent\u2019s camp and withdrew to P\u00e1lanpur. On this Lieutenant Robertson returned to Baroda, and a force, under Colonel Elrington, was ordered against P\u00e1lanpur to enforce a settlement of its affairs, and Captain Miles accompanied it to conduct the negotiations. On its approach on the 10th October, 1817, Shamsher Kh\u00e1n with the P\u00e1lanpur troops attacked the force, and after a slight skirmish retreated inside the walls. The town was then assaulted and carried. Shamsher Kh\u00e1n and his followers retired to the hills taking Fateh Kh\u00e1n with them.\n\nBeing pursued, Shamsher Kh\u00e1n took refuge in the foreign territory of Nimaj (Neemuch), and Fateh Kh\u00e1n speedily submitted, and, in consideration of his youth and inexperience, was received into favour. Unable to manage the state he, a few days later, through the G\u00e1\u00edkw\u00e1r Government requested the British to allow him an English officer to control his affairs, and also that the G\u00e1\u00edkw\u00e1r Government would depute a respectable native as agent to help in revenue matters, and ensure the regular payment of the G\u00e1\u00edkw\u00e1r tribute. Both requests were agreed to. Captain Miles was appointed Political Agent; the villages alienated by Shamsher Kh\u00e1n were resumed; and an agreement was entered into by the chief to subsidize 250 horse, to receive an agent from the G\u00e1\u00edkw\u00e1r in the confidence of the British Government, and to follow his advice, to pay the tribute punctually, and to protect no offenders against the British or G\u00e1\u00edkw\u00e1r Governments. A guarantee was also given to the state banker, and the chief placed on a fixed allowance, nemmuk, and the remaining income was not to be spent except with the sanction of the Political Superintendent. Next year (1819) Shamsher Kh\u00e1n surrendered himself, and was given nine villages, yielding about \u00a32500 (Rs. 25,000) a year, for his life. On his death in 1834 a provision to the amount of \u00a3600 (Rs. 6000) a year was made for his widows. In 1822 Fateh Kh\u00e1n agreed to forbid the transport of contraband opium through his territory. In 1848 the appointment of the G\u00e1\u00edkw\u00e1r\u2019s agent was abolished, and, six years later (1854), Fateh Kh\u00e1n died leaving four sons, Zor\u00e1war Kh\u00e1n and Ahmad Kh\u00e1n by Shamsher Kh\u00e1n\u2019s daughter, and Usman Kh\u00e1n and Sikandar Kh\u00e1n by another wife. He was succeeded by Zor\u00e1war Kh\u00e1n who gave the British much help in the mutiny of 1857. He died on the 28th August 1878 and was succeeded by his son Sher Muhammad Kh\u00e1n the present chief.\n\nThe Diw\u00e1n of P\u00e1lanpur, a first class chief, with full civil and criminal powers over all but British subjects, pays a yearly G\u00e1\u00edkw\u00e1r tribute of \u00a34375 (B\u00e1b\u00e1sh\u00e1i Rs. 50,000) and receives \u00a350 (Rs. 500)\n\n---\n\n1 Aitchison\u2019s Treaties (1876), IV. 52-54, XXI.\n2 Aitchison\u2019s Treaties (1876), IV. 55, XXII.\nfrom the R\u00e1na of D\u00e1nta in lieu of an engagement cancelled by the British Government in 1848.

British supervision has been of the greatest advantage to P\u00e1l\u00e1npur. Instead of miserable anarchy and confusion, it has enjoyed unbroken peace, and has paid off its ruinously heavy load of debt.\n\nThe following is the P\u00e1l\u00e1npur family tree:\n\n(I.)

Uszm\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n was probably either the son of Kam\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n, or the son or brother of Salim Kh\u00e1n.\nRa\u2019dhanpur, including Sami and Munjpur, is bounded on the north by Morv\u00e1da and Terv\u00e1da; on the east by the P\u00e1tan districts; on the south by Mandal and Jhinjuv\u00e1da; and on the west by V\u00e1r\u00e1hi. Square in shape and about thirty-five miles across, it has an area of 833 square miles, a population of 91,579 souls, or an average of 109-9 to the square mile, and an estimated yearly revenue of from \u00a350,000 to \u00a360,000 (Rs. 5,00,000 - 6,00,000).\n\nThe country is an open plain without hills and with few trees.\n\nLying close to the Ran, during April, May, June and July the heat is very great. If rain falls, August and September are pleasant, although October and November are hot; December, January, February and March are delightful, with a much keener cold than in P\u00e1l\u00e1npur. Rain generally falls during July, August and September, but the supply is small, lighter even than in P\u00e1l\u00e1npur. Though with greater extremes of heat and cold than P\u00e1l\u00e1npur the district is healthy.\n\nThe Ban\u00e1s, that crosses the district, is in the hot weather, too salt to drink. Many very fine built ponds hold water throughout the year. That at V\u00e1ghel, with steps all round, built by the V\u00e1ghela Rajputs and in good repair, is probably the finest in Gujar\u00e1t. The people trust for drinking water to the ponds, finding it even after they are dry, by digging in the beds. Near the surface the water is sweet; but the deeper down the more brackish it grows. In R\u00e1dhanpur, during the hot months, the people suffer much from want of water, and many move to Sami where all are supplied from its magnificent lake. Water is found from ten to thirty feet deep, but wells are usually dug in beds of ponds or streams.\n\nThe three chief soils, sandy, black, and salt, yield all the common grains. Except vegetables no watered crops are grown.\n\nR\u00e1dhanpur, now held by the celebrated B\u00e1bi family, who, ever since the reign of Humayun (1530 - 1556), have been prominent in Gujar\u00e1t history, is said to have formerly belonged to the V\u00e1ghelas, and to have been called Lunav\u00e1da after V\u00e1ghela Lun\u00e1ji of the Sardh\u00e1ra branch of that tribe. Subsequently, it was held as a fief under the Muhammadan kings of Gujar\u00e1t, by Fateh Kh\u00e1n Baloch, and is said to have been named R\u00e1dhanpur after R\u00e1dhan Kh\u00e1n of that family. The first B\u00e1bi that entered Hindust\u00e1n was one who accompanied Humayun. After the time of Akbar, they were attached to Gujar\u00e1t, where one Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n B\u00e1bi was, in the reign of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n (1627 - 1658), appointed manager of Thar\u00e1d, and his son Sher Kh\u00e1n B\u00e1bi was (1654 - 1657) sent to aid Prince Mur\u00e1d Baksh in the government of Gujar\u00e1t.\u00b9 In 1663, he was made manager, th\u00e1nd\u00e1r, of Chunv\u00e1l.\u00b2 In 1693, his son Jaffar Khan, whose talent and local influence gained him the title of Safdar\n\n\u00b9 According to another account the founder of the family came from Isph\u00e1h\u00e1n in Persia, and entered the service of Sult\u00e1n Muzaffar III. of Ahmedabad (1561 - 1572). Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 26.\n\u00b2 Bom. Gov. Sel. XV. 26. The statement (ibid) that the Jun\u00e1gad family is descended from a brother of Sher Kh\u00e1n is incorrect. The founder of the family was Sher Kh\u00e1n\u2019s great grandson, Muhammad Bah\u00e1dur, also called Sher Kh\u00e1n.\nKh\u00e1n and the charge of R\u00e1dhanpur, Sami, Munjpur, and Terv\u00e1da, was deputy governor of P\u00e1tan and eleven years later (1704), governor of Bij\u00e1pur. In 1706, he was made governor of P\u00e1tan.\\(^1\\) His son Kh\u00e1n Jah\u00e1n or Kh\u00e1nji Kh\u00e1n, with the title of Jaw\u00e1n Mard Kh\u00e1n, was, in 1715, appointed governor of R\u00e1dhanpur,\\(^2\\) and, in 1725, of P\u00e1tan. Four years later,\\(^3\\) while governor of Peitl\u00e1d, dying by the hand of a Koli of B\u00e1lor, his eldest son Kam\u00e1l-ud-din Kh\u00e1n was given the title of Jaw\u00e1n Mard Kh\u00e1n, and his second son Muhammad Anwar, the title of Safdar Kh\u00e1n, with the charge of R\u00e1dhanpur, Sami, Munjpur, Thar\u00e1d, Terv\u00e1da and V\u00e1r\u00e1hi, and 15,000 acres (30,000 bigh\u00e1s) of land in an islet in the Ran.\\(^4\\)\n\nDuring the next twenty-five years, (1729 - 1744), Jaw\u00e1n Mard Kh\u00e1n was one of the strongest of the Gujar\u00e1t nobles, and, at the same time, a branch of the house established itself at Jun\u00e1gad in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r and at B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor in the Rewa K\u00e1ntha. The founder of the Jun\u00e1gad house, who was also the first B\u00e1bi of B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor, was Muhammad Bah\u00e1dur, otherwise known as Sher Kh\u00e1n. In 1730, Jaw\u00e1n Mard Kh\u00e1n was appointed governor of Vadnagar, and three years later of Virang\u00e1m. From Virang\u00e1m he was, in the next year, transferred to K\u00e1di and Bij\u00e1pur, and, in 1738, was sent to P\u00e1tan, his brother Zor\u00e1war Kh\u00e1n getting Kher\u00e1l\u00fa instead of Par\u00e1ntij. About 1743, Jaw\u00e1n Mard Kh\u00e1n began to aspire to the post of Viceroy. He was already laying claim to the revenue of the district round Ahmedabad, when Fida-ud-din, who had, by a forged order, usurped the viceroyalty, appointed Jaw\u00e1n Mard Kh\u00e1n his deputy. Soon after, Fida-ud-din\u2019s troops mutinied and he fled leaving Jaw\u00e1n Mard Kh\u00e1n in possession of the city. Jaw\u00e1n Mard Kh\u00e1n now usurped the viceroyalty, and opposed and defeated the next two Viceroys, Muftakh\u00edr Kh\u00e1n and Fakhr-ud-daulah. A third Viceroy Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Vakhatsing never took up his appointment.\n\nIn 1753, while Jaw\u00e1n Mard Kh\u00e1n and his brother Zor\u00e1war Kh\u00e1n were levying tribute in S\u00e1bar K\u00e1ntha, Raghm\u00e1thr\u00e1v Peshwa and D\u00e1ms\u00e1ji G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r suddenly appeared before Ahmedabad. Hastening by forced marches, Jaw\u00e1n Mard Kh\u00e1n reached Ahmedabad and by night succeeded in entering the city. After a most brilliant defence, his funds failed him and he was forced to surrender. It was agreed that, for himself and his brothers, Jaw\u00e1n Mard Kh\u00e1n should receive, free from any Mar\u00e1tha claim, the districts of P\u00e1tan, Vadnagar, Sami, Munjpur, Visalnagar, Thar\u00e1d, Kher\u00e1l\u00fa, R\u00e1dhanpur with Terv\u00e1da, and Bij\u00e1pur, and that one of Jaw\u00e1n Mard Kh\u00e1n\u2019s brothers should serve the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s with 300 horse and 500 foot, the expenses of the force being paid by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. It was at the same time agreed that the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s should give Jaw\u00e1n\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Watson\u2019s Gujar\u00e1t, 83, 84, 86, 88.

Coming from P\u00e1tan he helped the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and, in 1757, after the surrender of the city again retired to P\u00e1tan. After the death of Jaw\u00e1n Mard Kh\u00e1n, D\u00e1m\u00e1ji Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r, in 1765, succeeded in wresting from his sons Gaz-ud-din and Nazm-ud-din, P\u00e1tan, Visalnagar, Vadnagar, Bij\u00e1pur, and Kher\u00e1l\u00fa, leaving them only R\u00e1dhanpur, Sami, Munjpur, Thar\u00e1d, Terv\u00e1da, and two villages in P\u00e1tan, Danora and P\u00e1lipur.\\(^2\\)\n\nSami and Munjpur were kept by Gaz-ud-din Kh\u00e1n, and R\u00e1dhanpur, Thar\u00e1d, and Terv\u00e1da by his brother, who, dying childless in 1787, the districts lapsed to the elder brother. Gaz-ud-din Kh\u00e1n had two sons, Sher Kh\u00e1n and Kam\u00e1l-ud-din Kh\u00e1n. On his death in 1813, the elder son kept R\u00e1dhanpur and the younger, Sami and Munjpur. Thar\u00e1d and Terv\u00e1da seem to have been lost.\n\nShortly after his accession, under the advice of Captain Carnac, Resident at Baroda, Sher Kh\u00e1n made a treaty with the Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r. In this the Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r, though he could not meddle with the internal management of R\u00e1dhanpur, was empowered, under the advice and mediation of the British Government, to control its external relations and to help the Naw\u00e1b in defending his state from foreign invasion.\\(^3\\) During the next five or six years, the Naw\u00e1b, finding himself powerless to check the raids of the Khos\u00e1s and other Sind marauders, sought the help of the British Government, and offered to pay his share of the cost of crushing the banditti. Help was at once given. In 1819, Colonel Barklay expelled the marauders from all parts of Gujar\u00e1t; and Major Miles who accompanied him as Political Agent, by the orders of the Bombay Government, negotiated an agreement with the Naw\u00e1b. Under the terms of this agreement the Naw\u00e1b bound himself not to harbour robbers, plunderers, or enemies of the British Government; to accompany the British troops with all his forces; and to pay a yearly tribute in proportion to his means.\\(^4\\) On the 18th February 1822 the yearly tribute was for five years fixed at a sum of \u00a31700 (Rs. 17,000). It continued in force for three years, when (26th July 1825) the Court of Directors, deeming the state unable to pay so large a sum, remitted it in full. Tribute has never again been imposed.\n\nKam\u00e1l-ud-din Kh\u00e1n, dying in 1824, his elder brother succeeded to the estate and died in 1825. He was succeeded by his illegitimate son Zor\u00e1war Kh\u00e1n, a child of three years old, Sard\u00e1r Bibi, the second wife of the late Naw\u00e1b, being appointed regent.

It has an area of 644 square miles, a population of 44,510 souls, or an average of 69\u00b711 to the square mile, and, including Morv\u00e1da, an estimated gross yearly revenue of \u00a38500 (Rs. 85,000).\n\nThe land, though generally flat, is in parts waving, without trees of any size, but covered here and there with low brushwood.\n\nThe climate is less temperate than in P\u00e1lanpur; it is hotter in April, May and June, and colder in January and February only. The common forms of sickness are much the same as in P\u00e1lanpur.\n\nThere are no rivers. But there is a good store of ponds and reservoirs, many of them, in average years, holding water till March.\nThe hot season's water-supply is drawn entirely from wells from seventy-five to 120 feet deep.\n\nThe soil is poor and sandy, yielding but one crop a year, and, from the want of rivers and the great depth of the water-bearing strata, is entirely dependent on the rainfall.\n\nThar\u00e1d is said to have originally belonged to Parm\u00e1r Rajputs, and to this day many Parm\u00e1rs of the Suv\u00e1r and Kalma clans are found in subordinate positions in the Thar\u00e1d villages. According to a Jain account, the last of the Parm\u00e1r line became a convert to the Jain faith, and resigned his chiefdom to his sister's son, the Choh\u00e1n of N\u00e1dol. Others say that the Choh\u00e1n killed his maternal uncle and usurped the chiefdom. The Choh\u00e1ns, with the title of R\u00e1na, ruled at Thar\u00e1d for about six generations, till, in the reign of R\u00e1na Punj\u00e1ji, they were attacked by the Muhammadans, their capital stormed, and their chief slain. Henceforward Thar\u00e1d became a Muhammadan holding, and for several generations a family with the patronymic Mult\u00e1ni ruled as proprietors, j\u00e1gird\u00e1rs, and commandants, th\u00e1nd\u00e1rs. As civil administrators of an isolated crown holding, they were invested with the title of Diw\u00e1n, and this title, though not recognised by the British Government, continues to the present day.\n\nThis Muhammadan conquest probably took place in the reign, either of Muhammad Shah\u00e1b-ud-din Ghori (1174-1206) or of Kutb-ud-din Eibak (1206-1210). In the latter monarch's reign, the change of capital from L\u00e1h\u00f3r to Delhi, and his numerous wars, made the Mult\u00e1ni family's position very difficult. That they were able to hold their own was due to the aid of a family of N\u00e1iks, who, originally Choh\u00e1ns, had become converts to Isl\u00e1m. In return for their services, the N\u00e1ik family received the grant of several villages which they still hold. At this time the smaller estates were chiefly in the hands of vassals of the Gohil and Parm\u00e1r clans. Kubh\u00e1ra and Led\u00e1n were held by Choh\u00e1ns; Duva, Roha, and Tithg\u00e1m by the Bhilria V\u00e1ghel\u00e1s of Bhilrigad; Eta and other villages by the descendants of Chibdia Br\u00e1hmans who held them from the R\u00e1thods of Kanouj, and the rest by owners of whom scarce a trace remains.\n\nAfter the Mus\u00e1lm\u00e1n conquest of Thar\u00e1d, the wife of R\u00e1na Punj\u00e1ji, a Sodhi by caste, fled with her infant son to her father's house at P\u00e1rkar. On growing up, her son Vajoji, returning to Thar\u00e1d in 1244 built a well, v\u00e1v, and, successfully beating off the attacks of the Mult\u00e1nis, took the title of R\u00e1na, and, after his well, called his town V\u00e1v. His descendants rule there to this day.\n\nCompared with that of the Mult\u00e1ni family, the cause of the V\u00e1v R\u00e1na was popular, and though for fear of drawing on themselves the army of the P\u00e1tan governor, they dared not attempt to win back Thar\u00e1d, they slowly spread their rule over many of the smaller holdings, and built up a fairly powerful chiefdom. Their cadets gradually won back many of the Thar\u00e1d holdings, turning\n\n---\n\n1 Another account says that the Choh\u00e1n Rajputs were driven out by the R\u00e1thods of Jodhpur, who were succeeded by the Muhammadans. Bom. Gov. Sel., XXV. 37.\nout the Gohil Suv\u00e1r and Kalma Rajputs, but continuing to hold their estates from Thar\u00e1d whose ruler they probably propitiated with gifts, nazar\u00e1n\u00e1s. In this way most of the smaller Thar\u00e1d fiefs fell into the hands of N\u00e1dola Choh\u00e1ns, cadets of the V\u00e1v house or of the old R\u00e1n\u00e1s of Thar\u00e1d by whom they are still held.\n\nOn the rise of the Mus\u00e1l\u00e1n dynasty of Ahmedabad (1403), the Mult\u00e1ni family became their vassals. Later on Fateh Kh\u00e1n Baloch, one of the chief Gujar\u00e1t nobles, held Terv\u00e1da and R\u00e1dhanpur, ousting the Mult\u00e1ni family who sank into obscurity, and now have only the Thar\u00e1d village of Kothig\u00e1m.\n\nWhen, about 1700, the Jh\u00e1lori family were driven from Jh\u00e1lor and settled at P\u00e1lampur, Firoz Kh\u00e1n Jh\u00e1lori obtained the chief power at Thar\u00e1d. This lasted only a short time. About 1730, Thar\u00e1d was given to Jaw\u00e1n Mard Kh\u00e1n B\u00e1bi of R\u00e1dhanpur. Very soon after, when Abhayasing (1730-1737) was Viceroy, the B\u00e1bi was turned out, and in his place a deputy was stationed at Thar\u00e1d. The next ruler of Thar\u00e1d was Choh\u00e1n Jetmalji, a cadet of the V\u00e1v house, who established himself there in 1736. In the following year, R\u00e1na Vajraj\u00ed, the head of the V\u00e1v house, fearing that Jetmalji might prove a dangerous rival, invited Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n of P\u00e1lampur to oust him. Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n agreed, and, driving out Jetmalji, kept the chiefship in his own hands. Within a few years (about 1740), the district was given either as an estate, j\u00e1ghird\u00e1ri, or as a charge, faujd\u00e1ri, to Naw\u00e1b Kam\u00e1l-ud-din Kh\u00e1n; till, in 1759, he handed it over to V\u00e1ghela K\u00e1nji, chief of Morv\u00e1da, one of the supporters of the B\u00e1bi family. This K\u00e1nji belonged to the Sardh\u00e1ra branch of the V\u00e1ghela tribe who took their name from the conquest of Sardhargad in Saur\u00e1shtra. A man of much talent and strength K\u00e1nji, before his death (1786), succeeded in making himself independent of his former patron. He was succeeded by his brother Harbh\u00e1mj\u00ed. About this time (1819), Thar\u00e1d being much harassed and almost unpeopled by the raids of Khos\u00e1s and other desert plunderers, the chief Harbh\u00e1mj\u00ed prayed the British Government to help him, offering to pay a share of the cost. In 1820, after the Khos\u00e1s had been driven out, the chief entered into an agreement similar to that made with R\u00e1dhanpur, and, on the 14th February 1821, it was decided by Government, that no tribute should be exacted until the revenue had increased one-half, when one-third of the increase was to be paid. In 1823 Harbh\u00e1mj\u00ed died and was succeeded by Karansing. Two years later (1825), the state was freed from tribute, and in 1826 a further agreement, partly in supersession of the former one, was signed and delivered to the British Government, wherein the chief agreed to allow no Kolis, Rajputs, or armed men of other districts to live in his territory; to give up to the British and Baroda\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Sel. XXV. 37.\n2 This fortress, conquered by V\u00e1ghela Muluji from Chur\u00e1sam Bhim, was held by the V\u00e1ghelas for three generations. Then V\u00e1ghela Lun\u00e1ji was expelled by Vibhoji, the head of the J\u00e1deja house of R\u00e1jkot. Lun\u00e1ji conquered R\u00e1dhanpur, V\u00e1r\u00e1hi, Khorda, S\u00e1ntalpur, and Gidi in Cutch. In 1479 (S. 1535) one of his descendants, R\u00e1na Visal Dev, conquered Morv\u00e1da, slaying its Ch\u00e1vad chief Mag\u00e1ji, and since then K\u00e1nji's forefathers have held Morv\u00e1da.\nGovernment any robbers or peace-breakers who sought shelter in his domain; to aid the British forces in the suppression of robbers; to keep the public peace and wage no private war; to refer all disputes to the British Government; and to be responsible for irregularities committed in the neighbouring British or Gaikwar territories by the Koli, Rajput, or other inhabitants of his district.\n\nIn 1859 Karansing died and was succeeded by Khengarsing, the present chief, now (1879) forty-three years of age. He has the powers of a first class magistrate and civil jurisdiction up to \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000). The military force of the state is fifty horse and thirty foot.\n\nKa'nkrej, stretching for about thirty-five miles along both banks of the Banas, is bounded on the north by Palanpur, on the east by the Gaikwar districts, on the south by Radhanpur, and on the west by Tervada and Diodar. It has an area of 507 square miles, a population of 37,771 souls or on an average 74:49 to the square mile, and an estimated gross yearly revenue of \u00a34000 (Rs. 40,000). Flat, open, and fairly wooded, its climate is much the same as that of Palanpur. The Banas runs through the district, and though during the hot weather its bed is usually dry, water is plentiful in most places from thirty to forty feet below the surface. It is generally raised by the leather bag, kos. The soil, sandy in some places and black in others, yields the usual rain and watered cold-weather crops.\n\nKankrej contains twenty-six distinct estates, held by Koli Thakardas, most of them Rajputs, who have intermarried with Kolis. Among them some families are Solankis, some Chohans, some Vaghelas, and some Parmars. The largest and most important estate is Thara, whose chiefs are Vaghela Kolis, originally of the Sardhara Vaghela tribe mentioned in the Tharad sketch. It is worthy of remark that these Vaghelas, though at one time degraded, have, by marrying into Rajput houses and refusing to eat with their brethren the Vaghela Kolis, been re-admitted into the Rajput class. Some chiefs of unblemished descent might refuse to eat with them. But they have a better tribal position than the Jadejas, and find no difficulty in getting in marriage the daughters of Rajputs.\n\nThere is much sameness in the history of these estates. Khamboi may be taken as a representative. In 1400 (S. 1456-57) an army under Prince Ahmad Shah, the founder of Ahmedabad, marched against the Solanki chieftains of Kalrigad, two to three miles north-east of Becharaji. The fight was long and hard, but in the end the Solanki chieftains Tejmalji, Sarangji, and Vejroji were slain and the fortress stormed. On the victor's side, forty-two nobles among them Moghal Ali Khan, 1300 men, and seventeen elephants were slain. The descendants of the Kalrigad Solankis settled in different\n\n---\n\n1 Aitchison's Treaties (1876), IV. 61, 62, XXVIII.\n2 The chief of Bhorol, a vassal of the Tharad Thakor owning ten villages, has the powers of a third class magistrate and civil jurisdiction up to \u00a325 (Rs. 250).\nplaces. Some went to Khemat now under P\u00e1l\u00e1npur, some to Dharampur, some to Virpur, and others to the S\u00e1gv\u00e1da, while one settled at Rupavatinagri. When Vejroji fell before Kalrigad, his wife Anopb\u00e1i, a Devri Rajput of the Shrohi stock, being pregnant, fled with 125 horse and many followers, of whom the chief were, Sukhra Virchand the minister, Harivalab a goldsmith, Vasr\u00e1n a barber, Vela a potter, and Dudo the family priest. They fled to the Oghar forest, which stretched for miles round where Oghar Thali now stands, and there founded a village, calling it Dudosan after Dudo, the family priest. Sukhra Virchand the minister built a well, and to the east of the village a temple of Mah\u00e1dev. R\u00e1ni Anopb\u00e1i also built a well and gave birth to a son called Venid\u00e1s, who, when he grew up, gathered 300 horsemen, and, under the name of Mohologi, took to a life of plunder. When he had laid waste some forty-two villages, the village headmen, with lighted stoves on their heads in token of submission, besought Ahmad Sh\u00e1h, who was now on the throne, for aid. Ahmad Sh\u00e1h sent an army to Dudosan, where, with their hands bound in token of submission, Sukhra Virchand, Dudo, Agra the headman, and others came to meet them. Ahmad Sh\u00e1h ordered them to produce Venid\u00e1s and they did so, but to hide his origin passed him off as a Koli Th\u00e1kor. Ahmad Sh\u00e1h forced him to marry Ratanb\u00e1i, daughter of a Koli Th\u00e1kor of Terv\u00e1da, and then gave him the twelve villages of Dudosan, R\u00e1khol, Kh\u00e1r\u00fa, S\u00e1ngla, \u00c1khi\u0144, Mah\u00e1san, Lodhi, J\u00e1lia, Char\u00e1da, K\u00e1lodhi, Vadu\u0144, and Valodu\u0144. Ahmad Sh\u00e1h granted these villages in gift, and a copper plate deed and a writing, in the bard Anchla's book, were drawn up.\n\nVenid\u00e1s had three sons by his Koli bride, Vajar\u00e1jji, Jesoji, and N\u00e1noji. Jesoji left Dudosan and came to Khamboi, where he built four wells. His descendants are called Khamboi\u00e1s. N\u00e1noji served Ahmad Sh\u00e1h and was exceedingly useful to him in settling the K\u00e1nkrej and Chunv\u00e1l, and received from him Anniv\u00e1da, and twelve villages. His descendants are called Arnivadi\u00e1s. Jesoji of Khamboi had three sons, Bhimoji, Khemoji, and Khadalji. Bhimoji and Khemoji having plundered Chunv\u00e1l, Ahmedabad troops were sent against them and they were forced to submit. Bhimoji had one son, Sundarji, and his brother Khemoji had four, Udayraj, Ud\u00f3ji, Bh\u00e1rmalji, and K\u00e1narji. Ud\u00f3ji leaving Khamboi founded Arduv\u00e1da. Sundarji had three sons, Bharmoji, N\u00e1poji, and Mep\u00e1ji. The descendants of N\u00e1poji were called Vasm\u00e1nis and those of Mep\u00e1ji, Khokh\u00e1n\u00ed\u015b. The connection of K\u00e1nkrej with the British Government dates from 1819-20, when the Mahi K\u00e1ntha Agency was formed. It continued part of the Mahi K\u00e1ntha till, in 1844, on account of its nearness to P\u00e1l\u00e1npur, it was transferred to the P\u00e1l\u00e1npur Superintendency.\n\nSa'ntalpur, in the rainy season an island in the Ran, and Cha'dchat, the strip of land to the east of Sa'ntalpur, are bounded on the north by Suig\u00e1m and Morv\u00e1da, on the east by R\u00e1dhanpur and V\u00e1r\u00e1hi, and on the south and west by the Ran. About thirty-seven miles long and seventeen broad, they have an area of 440 square miles, a population of 18,193 souls or on an average 41\u00b734 to the square\nmile, and an estimated gross yearly revenue of \u00a33500 (Rs. 35,000). Flat and open, the climate is almost the same as in R\u00e1dhanpur. There are no rivers, but many ponds, which in average seasons hold water till March. During the hot season, water is drawn from wells generally from five to twenty feet deep. None of the three soils, clayey, sandy, and black, yields more than one crop of common grain a year. Natural salt, gh\u00e1sia, is formed in large quantities.\n\nThe proprietors of S\u00e1ntalpur and Ch\u00e1dchat are Jadeja Rajputs. According to the local history, before the Jadejas came S\u00e1ntalpur was held by Turks, probably a colony from Sind. After them came the Jh\u00e1l\u00e1s, one of whom founded and gave his name to the village of S\u00e1ntalpur. S\u00e1ntal Jh\u00e1l\u00e1 married a sister of Lun\u00e1ji V\u00e1ghela, the conqueror of Gidi and R\u00e1dhanpur, but, offending Lun\u00e1ji, was attacked by him and slain. S\u00e1ntalpur did not long continue under V\u00e1ghela rule. Sarkh\u00e1ji the son of Lun\u00e1ji was driven out by R\u00e1o Kheng\u00e1rji of Cutch (1548-1585) who took both S\u00e1ntalpur and Ch\u00e1dchat.\n\nCh\u00e1dchat is said to take its name from the Ch\u00e1vad or Ch\u00e1d branch of the Parmar tribe who conquered the district, till then occupied by Turks, probably the same who settled at S\u00e1ntalpur. This tribe was afterwards known in history as the Ch\u00e1vad Rajputs, though in reality a sub-division of the ancient tribe of Parm\u00e1rs. Five Ch\u00e1dchat villages were wrested from the Jadejas by V\u00e1ghela K\u00e1nji of Morv\u00e1da and annexed to his domain. These states are divided amongst a number of chiefs, the principal of whom are Devising, now (1879) forty-two years old, and L\u00e1khh\u00e1ji, twenty-seven. They have the powers of third class magistrates and civil jurisdiction up to \u00a325 (Rs. 250). These states made agreements with the British Government similar to the R\u00e1dhanpur agreement of 1820 and the Thar\u00e1d agreement of 1826. The agreement now in force is dated 3rd January 1827. They have also signed the agreement forbidding the transit of opium.\n\nV\u00e1v stretches from north to south about thirty-five, and from east to west about fifteen miles. Bounded on the north by S\u00e1chor in M\u00e1rw\u00e1r, on the east by Thar\u00e1d, on the south by Suig\u00e1m, and on the west by the Ran, V\u00e1v has an area of 360 square miles, a population of 23,081 souls or on an average 64\u00b711 to the square mile, and an estimated gross yearly revenue of \u00a33000 (Rs. 30,000). Like Thar\u00e1d, V\u00e1v is a flat plain, sandy, except on the west, where the soil is hard and clayey. The climate does not differ from that of R\u00e1dhanpur. There are no rivers, but in average years ponds hold water till March. During the hot season water is drawn from wells of which there are many, with a free, though somewhat brackish, supply. The sandy soil yields only one crop a year, and that of common grain. Large quantities of natural salt, gh\u00e1sia, are formed in all the Ran pans, but its export is forbidden.\n\nThe V\u00e1v family came from S\u00e1mbhar and N\u00e1ndol in M\u00e1rw\u00e1r, and claim kindred with Pruthur\u00e1j, the Choh\u00e1n king of Delhi, who was defeated and slain by the Afgh\u00e1ns in 1193. After many turns of fortune, Dedhr\u00e1v, driven out of N\u00e1ndol, settled at Thar\u00e1d, then under the Anhilv\u00e1da kings. R\u00e1na Punj\u00e1ji, the seventh in descent\nfrom Dedhr\u00e1v, was killed in battle, and his son R\u00e1na Vajoji, stripped of the Thar\u00e1d estates, built the town of V\u00e1v. From the founder of V\u00e1v, the present R\u00e1na Umedsing is eighteenth in descent. The origin and nature of the relations between V\u00e1v and the British Government differ little from those of Thar\u00e1d. Harassed by the Khos\u00e1s and other marauders, this state, in 1819, sought and received the aid of the British Government, and in the following year (1820) became bound by the same agreement as that concluded with the R\u00e1dhanpur state in 1820. Freed from the payment of tribute in 1826, the chief, on the 29th August of that year, signed an agreement like that at the same time concluded with the Thar\u00e1d state. This remains in force to the present day. The present chief R\u00e1na Umedsing, eighteenth in descent from the founder of V\u00e1v, is (1879) thirty-one years old, and has the powers of a second class magistrate and civil jurisdiction up to \u00a350 (Rs. 500). The military force is thirty horse and twenty foot.\n\nV\u00e1ra'hi, bounded on the north by Ch\u00e1dchat, on the east by R\u00e1dhanpur, on the south by the Ran, and on the west by S\u00e1ntalpur, about twenty-five miles long and ten broad, has an area of 204 square miles, a population of 20,096 souls or an average of 98\u00b750 to the square mile, and an estimated gross yearly revenue of \u00a34000 (Rs. 40,000). In appearance and climate V\u00e1r\u00e1hi differs little from R\u00e1dhanpur. The Ban\u00e1s runs through the district from east to west, but is dry except after very heavy rains in the \u00c1bu and other eastern hills. There are many ponds, and, as at R\u00e1dhanpur, when they are dry, water is found by digging in their beds and in the beds of streams. Only near the surface is the water good. There are three soils, sandy, black, and, towards the Ran, salt. The two former yield a yearly crop of one of the common grains, with a good deal of cotton, and much excellent wheat, grown as in R\u00e1dhanpur without watering. In the western lands much natural salt, gh\u00e1sta, is formed. But its sale is forbidden, the chief being compensated for his loss of revenue.\n\nThis estate was formerly held by the R\u00e1vni\u00e1s from whom it was wrested by its present Jat holders. These Jats, originally inhabitants of Baluch\u00edst\u00e1n and Makr\u00e1n, are said to have come in 711 with the army of Muhammad K\u00e1sim, and settled at V\u00e1nga in Sind. It is said that a Sind ruler sought to force into his harem two of Malik Umar Kh\u00e1n\u2019s daughters, and that the Jats resisting were attacked and forced to fly to Cutch. Finding no shelter, they fled to K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r where the Parm\u00e1rs of Muli helped them. In return for their services at the siege of Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner (1484), Mahmud Begada gave the Jats the district of Baj\u00e1na in Jh\u00e1l\u00e1vad under the K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r Agency. Afterwards they got leave to attack Mandal, and took it after some days fighting. Before long, falling into disfavour with the Ahmedabad government, Mandal was taken from them, and the family was spilt into many branches, of which the chief were Malik Haidar Kh\u00e1n\u2019s at Baj\u00e1na, Malik L\u00e1kha\u2019s at Sit\u00e1pur.\n\n---\n\n1 Bom.

Malik Is\u00e1ji, called in to settle a quarrel between R\u00e1vn\u00edas Godar and L\u00e1kha of Varahi, took advantage of their dissensions to slay the one and drive away the other, who, after holding out for some time in the village of Lunkhan, fled to Konmer Kat\u00e1ri in Chor Vaghar, and settled there. The R\u00e1vn\u00edas, who stayed in Varahi, were given the villages of Mehmodabad, Javantri, and Antarnes, while Malik Is\u00e1ji assumed the chiefdom of Varahi.\n\nThe Jats have always been fond of robbery and plunder, and before the time of British rule, were notorious freebooters, plundering even to the walls of Ahmedabad, and forcing their weaker neighbours to buy their forbearance and protection by a money payment known as vol. In the time of Naw\u00e1b Sher Kh\u00e1n of Radhanpur, it became necessary to put down their excesses, and by order of the Peshwa\u2019s government they were attacked in 1812 and defeated, and their chief Umar Kh\u00e1n taken prisoner and sent to Radhanpur. Afterwards, escaping from confinement, the Naw\u00e1b, in 1815, confirmed him in his possessions. Since then, under the British Government, they have given up raiding and robbing, but are still quarrelsome and fond of going to law.\n\nTh\u00e1kor Sh\u00e1d\u00e1d Kh\u00e1n died in 1847, leaving three widows, two of whom were brought to bed of sons eight months after his death. The legitimacy of the children was questioned by the next of kin; but their proofs failed, and Umar Kh\u00e1n, the elder child was named chief, and his estate managed by the Political Superintendent. Umar Kh\u00e1n, now (1879) about thirty-two years old, is still chief. He has power to imprison for fifteen days and fine up to \u00a32 10s. (Rs. 25).\n\nRelations between the petty state of Varahi and the British Government date from the year 1819. In 1820, its chief signed an agreement like that entered into by the Naw\u00e1b of Radhanpur; in 1822, he agreed to stop the transit of opium; and in 1826 was freed from tribute on the same terms as those accepted by the Thar\u00e1d chief.\n\nDiodar, bounded on the north by Thar\u00e1d, on the east by K\u00e1nkrej, on the south by Bh\u00e1bhar and Terv\u00e1da, and on the west by Suig\u00e1m and Thar\u00e1d, about twelve miles long and twenty-five broad, has an area of 240 square miles, a population of 19,701 souls or an average of 82:08 to the square mile, and an estimated gross yearly revenue of \u00a32500 (Rs. 25,000). A flat sandy plain, covered with low brushwood, in climate it differs little from Radhanpur. There are no rivers, but in average seasons its ponds hold water till March. The rather brackish hot-weather supply is drawn from wells generally from forty to sixty feet deep. There is no irrigation. The sandy soil yields only one crop of the commoner grains.\n\n---\n\n1 Another account states that the Jats gained possession of Varahi from the Roma Musalm\u00e1ns, Bom. Gov. Sel. XXV. 32.\n2 Bom. Gov. Sel. XXV. 33. The date 1812 seems doubtful as, according to the same account, Sher Kh\u00e1n did not succeed till 1813 (Ditto, 27).\nDiodar is held by the Bhilria V\u00e1ghel\u00e1s, who, on the overthrow of Rajput power in P\u00e1tan, took (1297) Bhilri, now under P\u00e1l\u00e1npur, and for some generations held it. Driven out by the Musalm\u00e1ns, they, in turn, held Samav in K\u00e1nkrej, Munjpur in R\u00e1dhanpur, and Terv\u00e1da in Thar\u00e1d, and, again ousted by the Musalm\u00e1ns, took Diodar. Once an estate of eighty-four villages, Diodar is not now more than half its former size, much of it having passed to the K\u00e1nkrej and B\u00e1bhar Kol\u00eds. In the famine of 1786 the district was deserted, the chief with his family seeking a maintenance elsewhere. Punj\u00e1j\u00ed, one of the Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d, took service with the Naw\u00e1b of R\u00e1dhanpur, and giving much satisfaction, was helped by the Naw\u00e1b to win back the Diodar district from the Kol\u00eds, who had taken it when the V\u00e1ghel\u00e1s left. Punj\u00e1j\u00ed, at considerable expense, re-established some of the villages, and, in the absence of the elder branch, usurped its rights, and refused to restore them on the return of the chief. The complaint was brought before Colonel Miles in 1828, but, as the usurpation dated from before the establishment of British authority, the elder branch was not restored, but only provided with a maintenance. The district was shared by the two sons of Punj\u00e1j\u00ed, Akhesing and Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1j\u00ed, who were considered the chiefs of Diodar, in supersession of the elder branch. Akhesing and Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1j\u00ed have died, and Maluji, son of Akhesing, and Bhupatsing, grandson of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1j\u00ed, are the present Th\u00e1kors. They have the powers of third class magistrates and civil jurisdiction up to \u00a325 (Rs. 250).\n\nThe state has entered into engagements with the British Government similar to the R\u00e1dhanpur engagement of 1820 and the Thar\u00e1d engagement of 1826. It has also signed an agreement forbidding the transit of opium through its territory.\n\nSuiga'm is bounded on the north and east by V\u00e1v, on the south by Ch\u00e1dehat, and on the west by the Ran. About twenty miles long and eight broad, it has an area of 161 square miles, a population of 10,104 souls or an average of 62\u00b775 to the square mile, and an estimated gross yearly revenue of \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000). The district is flat and open with a climate much like that of R\u00e1dhanpur. It has no rivers but many ponds that in average seasons hold water till March. The hot-weather water supply is from wells, brackish and rather scanty, but found at a depth of not more than fifteen feet. The soil, sandy and salt, yields only poor crops of the common grains. Natural salt, gh\u00e1sia, is formed in large quantities on the Ran.\n\nThe Suig\u00e1m T\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs are sprung from Pach\u00e1nji, the youngest son of R\u00e1na Sangoji of V\u00e1v, who, in 1569 (S. 1625), founded the village of Suig\u00e1m, naming it after Sui, a Rab\u00e1ri by caste, who lived there. R\u00e1j\u00e1j\u00ed, one of Pach\u00e1nji's descendants, founded the estate, conquering Radhosan and its five villages from \u00c1j\u00e1na Choh\u00e1n, and\n\n---\n\n1 These Bhilria V\u00e1ghel\u00e1s once owned Terv\u00e1da, a small district in the possession of a younger branch of the Thar\u00e1d V\u00e1ghel\u00e1s. Bom. Gov. Sel. XXV. 44.\n2 Bom. Gov. Sel. XXV. 45.\nKumbh\u00e1rka and other villages from the Jats. The heads of the family, Th\u00e1kors Bhupatsing and N\u00e1th\u00e1ji, have under them a large, almost independent, body of cadets, formerly noted freebooters and allies of the Khos\u00e1s, but now for fifty years an orderly peasantry. This state's relations with the British Government are fixed by the terms of the agreements of 1820 and 1826, the same as the R\u00e1dhanpur agreement of 1820 and the Thar\u00e1d agreement of 1826.\n\nTerv\u00e1'da is bounded on the north by Diodar, on the east by K\u00e1nkrej, on the south by R\u00e1dhanpur, and on the west by Bh\u00e1bhar. About fifteen miles long and eighteen broad, it has an area of 100 square miles, a population of 7338 souls or an average of 73\u00b738 to the square mile, and an estimated yearly gross revenue of \u00a31200 (Rs. 12,000). Flat and open with low brushwood in a few places, it has, like other districts close to the Ran, a light rainfall, a bracing cold weather, and a hot season of scorching winds. The common forms of sickness are the same as in P\u00e1lanpur. Though without rivers the district is well supplied with ponds. Well water, brackish towards the north, is found from thirty to seventy-five feet deep. The soil, sandy and in places black, yields only one common grain crop. There are no watered lands, and much is used only for grazing.\n\nTerv\u00e1da, once the chief town of a large district, was, along with the neighbouring estate of Diodar, held by the Bhilria V\u00e1ghel\u00e1s. Under the Ahmedabad Sult\u00e1ns, Terv\u00e1da together with R\u00e1dhanpur, Morvi, Sami, Munjpur K\u00e1nkrej, S\u00e1ntalpur, and Thar\u00e1d, came into the hands of Fateh Kh\u00e1n and Rustam Kh\u00e1n Baloch, members of one of the most powerful families of Gujar\u00e1t nobles. With Terv\u00e1da as their head quarters, the Baloch family continued to hold these lands till, early in the eighteenth century, they were taken by Naw\u00e1b Kam\u00e1l-ud-din Kh\u00e1n B\u00e1bi, and confirmed to him by the Viceroy Mubariz-ul-Mulk (1723-1730). The present Baloch holders claim to be the descendants of the old Baloch family; this the R\u00e1dhanpur chief denies, stating that they are soldiers of fortune who owe their rise to his house. But as he brings forward no evidence to support his statement, it seems probable that the claim of the Terv\u00e1da family is well founded. During the eighteenth century, besides the parts made over to the B\u00e1bi family, much of the Terv\u00e1da estate was filched away from the weakened head of the house by his Koli and other marauding neighbours. Of the former 104 Terv\u00e1da villages only sixteen remain. These were, in 1822, confirmed to Baloch Kh\u00e1n, the father of the present chief Th\u00e1kor Nathu Kh\u00e1n, as the Naw\u00e1b of R\u00e1dhanpur failed to disprove his claim. Th\u00e1kor Nathu Kh\u00e1n is now (1879) forty-nine years old and has the powers of a third class magistrate and civil jurisdiction up to \u00a325 (Rs. 250). The state has entered into the three regular engagements of 1819, 1822, and 1826.\n\n1 The family now in possession of Terv\u00e1da originally came from Sind. From the first they appear to have attached themselves to the Naw\u00e1b, serving as simple horsemen; they were probably afterwards employed as th\u00e1nd\u00e1rs in keeping the district in order, and doubtless took advantage of the times to enrich themselves at the expense of their master, the Naw\u00e1b of R\u00e1dhanpur. Bom. Gov. Sel, XXV. 35.\n\n2 Major J. W. Watson.\nChapter XIII.\n\nStates.\n\nMorv\u00e1da.\n\nMorv\u00e1da, bounded on the north by Suig\u00e1m, on the east by Terv\u00e1da, and on the south and west by Ch\u00e1dchat and S\u00e1ntalpur, has an area of ninety-six square miles, with a population of 6595 souls or an average of 68\u00b774 to the square mile. Its revenue is included in the revenues of the Thar\u00e1d state.\u00b9 A flat sandy plain, with a few large trees near the villages and but little brushwood or bush, the climate does not differ from that of Thar\u00e1d. There are no rivers, but many ponds which in average seasons hold water till March. During the hot season the people depend on their wells. Water is found within a few feet of the surface, and is raised in a leather bag, kos. As in Thar\u00e1d, the soil is poor and sandy. Very little grain, but a large quantity of vegetables, is grown from irrigation.\n\nMorv\u00e1da is said formerly to have belonged to Turks and to have been conquered from them by Ch\u00e1vda Rajputs, who in 1479 (S. 1535), were expelled by Visaldev, a descendant of Lun\u00e1ji V\u00e1ghela.\u00b2 It is still in the possession of the V\u00e1ghela house of Thar\u00e1d, the lineal descendants of Visaldev.\n\nBha'bhar.\n\nBha'bhar is bounded on the north by Diodar, on the east and south by Terv\u00e1da, and on the west by Suig\u00e1m and Thar\u00e1d. About ten miles long and nine broad, it has an area of seventy-two square miles, a population of 5659 souls or an average of 78\u00b759 to the square mile, and an estimated gross yearly revenue of \u00a3250 (Rs. 2500). Flat with much brushwood, the climate is like that of P\u00e1lampur. There are some ponds, but in the hot season, water is almost entirely drawn from wells from thirty to fifty feet deep. The soil, chiefly sandy, yields only one crop of the common grains.\n\nBh\u00e1bhar, held by Koli Th\u00e1kard\u00e1s, has a history closely like that of the K\u00e1nkrej estates. Originally part of the Terv\u00e1da district, it was taken in farm by R\u00e1thod H\u00e1thuji of K\u00e1nkrej, who in 1742, took advantage of the prevailing anarchy, to establish the village of Bh\u00e1bhar, and by degrees to gain possession of the deserted lands of Terv\u00e1da. At present, under two nominal chiefs, the village lands are parcelled among a large body of cadets, bh\u00fap\u00e1d, who from their original connection with the parent stem think themselves independent, and submit to no control from their senior branches. British relations with Bh\u00e1bhar date from 1820, when the chief signed an agreement like the R\u00e1dhanpur agreement of the same date, and in 1826 an agreement with the same conditions as that of Thar\u00e1d.\n\n\u00b9 See above, \"Thar\u00e1d\".\n\u00b2 According to another account the V\u00e1ghela Rajputs obtained possession of Morv\u00e1da from the Ch\u00e1vda Rajputs about 1508. Bom. Gov. Sel. XXV. 37.\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nPLACES OF INTEREST.\n\nBhilrigad, an ancient seat of the Bhilora V\u00e1ghel\u00e1s, has marble ruins of houses and wells. For years its ruins have been steadily carried away and are gradually disappearing. Only a well or two and a few pillars are left above ground, though digging brings to light beautiful marble carvings in a high style of art.\n\nChandra'vati, or Chandra'vali, in a waste forest tract about twelve miles south of mount \u00c1bu and a little more than twelve miles from the shrines of Amba Bhav\u00e1ni and T\u00e1ringa, has the ruins of an ancient city said to have once been eighteen miles in circuit. Not far from one of the main lines of traffic between the coast and Upper India, and midway between the shrines of Amba Bhav\u00e1ni and T\u00e1ringa on the one hand, and \u00c1bu on the other, Chandr\u00e1vati was important both as a religious and a commercial centre. The remains of the old city, and the temples of \u00c1bu, shew the wealth and taste of its merchants, and the talent of its architects and masons, and it was to the skill of Chandr\u00e1vati weavers and dyers that, in after-times, the silks and calicoes of Ahmedabad owed most of their fame. Its prosperity seems to have lasted from the seventh to the beginning of the fifteenth century. Tradition gives it an earlier origin than Dh\u00e1r, making it the metropolis of Western India, when the Parm\u00e1r was paramount lord to whom the nine castles of the desert were the grand subordinate fiefs. In the seventh century, then subordinate to Dh\u00e1r, it proved a place of refuge to R\u00e1ja Bhoj, when, by some northern invader, he was forced to flee from his capital. From the Parm\u00e1rs it was wrested by the Choh\u00e1n chieftains of Sirohi, and, on the establishment of the Solanki dynasty of Anhilv\u00e1da\n\n---\n\n1 From \u00c1bu to Chandr\u00e1vati, says Col. Tod (1823), the route runs through one continuous forest and the site of the city is overgrown with brushwood. Western India, 130. Since 1823, except that most of the ruins have disappeared, the state of the city and of the country round remains unchanged.\n\n2 Mah\u00f3l, a village nine miles to the north-west, is said to have been one of its suburbs and the site of one of its gates. Western India, 130.\n\n3 The date is uncertain. It must have been before the seventh century.

IV. 146.\nChapter XIV.\n\nPlaces of Interest.\n\nChandravati.\n\n(942) the rulers of Chandravati became their vassals. The remains both at Chandravati and on mount Abu seem to point to the eleventh and twelfth centuries as the time of greatest wealth and splendour. In 1197, its rulers Prahladan and Dharavarsh, as feudatories to Bhim Dev II. (1178 - 1243) of Anhilvada, encamping near Abu, attempted to hold the entrance into Gujarat against Kutb-ud-din Aibak (1192 - 1210). Notwithstanding their strong position they were attacked, defeated, and put to flight. Great wealth fell into the victor's hands, and, as he passed on and took Anhilvada, it is probable that, on his way, he plundered Chandravati. Kutb-ud-din's expedition was little more than a passing raid, and Dhavarsh's son succeeded him. He, or his successor, was about 1270 defeated and driven out by the Chohans of Nadol, and they in turn about 1300 by the Chohans of Deora. Then (1304) came Ala-ud-din's final conquest of Gujarat, and Chandravati, with Anhilvada as the centre of Musalm\u00e1n power, lost almost all independence. Another hundred years completed its ruin. In the beginning of the fifteenth century, by the founding of Sirohi (1405), Chandravati ceased to be the seat of a Hindu chief, and, a few years later (1411 - 1412), its buildings and skilled craftsmen were carried off to enrich the new capital of Sultan Ahmad (1411-1443). Since then Chandravati has remained forsaken and desolate. Even its ruins, sold and carried off as building materials, have all but disappeared. Though some are more modern, most of the Chandravati remains belong to the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the best period of Abu architecture (1032 - 1247).\n\nIn 1824 Sir Charles Colville and his party, the first European visitors to Chandravati, found twenty marble edifices of different sizes. One Brahmanic temple was adorned with rich, very well executed sculptured figures and ornaments in high relief, many of the figures almost quite detached. The chief images were a three-headed male figure sitting on a car with a woman on its knee and a large goose in front; two Shivas, one with twenty arms, the other with a buffalo on the left, the right foot raised and resting on a small eagle, garud; and a figure of death with twenty arms. The best executed were the dancing nymphs, with garlands and musical instruments, many of them extremely graceful. Except the roof of the domes, whose outer marble cover was gone, the temple was white marble throughout, the lustre of the prominent parts\n\n---\n\n1 The Parmar rulers of Abu acknowledged the supremacy of Mul Raj Solanki of Anhilvada (942-997).

A low wall that once surrounded the town is now in utter ruin. About two miles north-east of the town is the British cantonment with a force of one regiment of Native Cavalry, a battery of Royal Artillery, and a regiment of British and of Native Infantry. In 1820, the plundering and marauding habits of the chiefs between Cutch and \u00c1bu, and the incursions of the desert and P\u00e1\u0301rkar Khos\u00e1s into V\u00e1gad and north-west Gujar\u00e1t, induced Government to assemble a small field force on the banks of the Ran, and was ultimately (1821) the cause of a brigade being stationed at Deesa. The effect was satisfactory; disorder ceased, and from the strong positions held by outposts, order was for years maintained unbroken. The cantonment, with its population of 5940 souls of whom 3031 were Hindus, 977 Musalm\u00e1ns, 1843 Christians, and 89 'Others', is commanded by a Brigadier-General. Sanitary arrangements are controlled by a cantonment committee. The station has five hospitals, four of them military and one a lock hospital.\n\nIn the town, though the houses are crowded and irregular, and the streets narrow and dirty, the water supply is good and the public health better than in P\u00e1lanpur. Deesa, under the name of Faridabad, is said to have once been a flourishing town. Like P\u00e1lanpur it came under the present chief early in the seventeenth century. Of 3582 the total 1872 population, 1784 or 49\u00b780 per cent were Hindus, and 719 or 20\u00b708 per cent Musalm\u00e1ns. Deesa gives its name to the Des\u00e1v\u00e1l sub-division of V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s chiefly Vaishnavs in religion and found as traders in all parts of Gujar\u00e1t. The Musalm\u00e1ns, husbandmen and constables, are poor. The V\u00e1n\u00eda traders, both Br\u00e1hmanic and Jain, are well-to-do. Without any special local manufactures, Deesa, on the highway between M\u00e1rw\u00e1r and Gujar\u00e1t, and as the grain market for the country round, is a more important place of trade than P\u00e1lanpur. The chief exports and imports are the same as those of P\u00e1lanpur. Deesa is the head quarters of a state sub-divisional officer, *tehsild\u00e1r*, with limited revenue, civil,\n\n---\n\n1 Western India, 135.\n2 R\u00e1s M\u00e1la, 195.\n3 The present (1879) population is returned at 13,103 souls, lodged in 4542 houses.

The only objects of interest are the residence of the chief, at present in bad repair, a large conical building richly carved and surrounded by a well built wall, and the temple of Siddh M\u00e1ta, the clan goddess of the Des\u00e1v\u00e1l V\u00e1ni\u00e1s, who, on Chaitra sud 10th (April), come from great distances to visit the shrine. There are also two Jain temples and a mosque.\n\n**Dharnidhar.**\n\nDharnidhar at Dhema under V\u00e1v, is, for all Hindus except Jains, the chief place of pilgrimage in the P\u00e1lanpur state. Traces of snake worship remain in the image of the earth-supporting snake, *dhennag*. The temple though old is commonplace.\n\n**Ka'kar.**\n\nKa'kar, the ancient capital of K\u00e1nkrej about five miles north of Thava, has a Jain temple whose few remaining marble carvings are said to show traces of Greek art. Where entire temples are found, the architecture corresponds with the Ch\u00e1lukya and Jain styles. The relief carving is peculiarly spirited and equals the art remains at Sidhpur P\u00e1tan and Modhera. The male and female figures have a peculiar head dress and the men have generally boots curiously like what are called Hessians.\n\n**Ka'nodar.**\n\nKa'nodar, five miles south of P\u00e1lanpur, is chiefly inhabited by Meman weavers who make several kinds of cotton cloth in much local demand.\n\n**Kasera.**\n\nKasera, in the Thara estate of K\u00e1nkrej, has an old Vishnavite temple, built in layers of different coloured sandstone highly carved and ornamented. The carvings and mouldings have suffered much, but, except the upper part of the tower, the building is wonderfully preserved. Besides its layers of different coloured stone, the building is of peculiar construction with a central porch, *mandap*, and three sides as well as the usual back shrine. Its greatest length is about thirty feet. The original image of Vishnu in his four-handed, *chatuwbhuj*, form, is said to have been carried away by the Emperor Ala-ud-din Khilji (1295-1315). The present building is probably from 400 to 500 years old. According to local story it stands on the site of a temple built by Gandharvasen, the heaven-born father of Vikram\u00e1ditya (56 B.C.), who, in memory of having once borne the form of an ass, is said to have introduced in all his works an ornament in the likeness of an ass-hoof. The ass-hoof ornament is freely used in this Kasera temple. According to Mr. Burgess it is not peculiar to Gandharvasen\u2019s works, being really the same as the \u2018Chaitya window\u2019 ornament common in early Buddhist and Br\u00e1hm\u00e1nic buildings.\n\n**Loti.**\n\nLoti, a village to the west of Munjpur, has a temple of Loteshvar Mah\u00e1dev with a reservoir, *kund*, in front, called *pretgaya*. A yearly fair, attended by about 2000 pilgrims, is held here on Ph\u00e1gavad Am\u00e1v\u00e1sya (March - April). A bath in the pool, and certain religious ceremonies, are believed to draw out evil spirits and, at the same time, give them freedom, *mukti*, and absorption into the eternal Brahma.\n\n**Munjpur.**\n\nMunjpur, in a rough country about twenty-two miles south-east of R\u00e1dhanpur, has a mosque with a Persian writing in the name of\nZafar Kh\u00e1n, son of Vajih-ul-mulk the founder of the dynasty of Gujar\u00e1t Sult\u00e1ns (1391-1410). In 1816 it suffered a heavy loss, the great plague having carried off about one-half of its people.\u00b9 In 1820 Munjpur had 'insignificant fortifications.'\u00b2\n\nNehr is a tract in the extreme north-west of Gujar\u00e1t of which Vav is the chief town. To the west, dry and sandy, without rivers, streams, or any trustworthy supply of well water, it nearly approaches the character of the Ran. When brought under order (1810-1820), Nehr was famous for its horses and for the ferocity and lawlessness of its people, Rajputs, Muhammadans, and Kolis, 'conjointly and severally thieves and depredators.'\u00b3 Its chief historic interest is that it gave its name to Nehrv\u00e1la, Anhilv\u00e1da, or P\u00e1tan, from the eighth to the fifteenth century (746-1411) the chief seat of authority in Gujar\u00e1t.\u2074\n\nP\u00e1lanpur, with, in 1872, a population of 17,189 souls, stands in north latitude 24\u00b0 12' and east longitude 72\u00b0 23', eighteen miles east of Deesa camp. It is the head-quarters of the P\u00e1lanpur Political Superintendency, and the seat of the chief, or Diw\u00e1n, of the P\u00e1lanpur state, a Musalm\u00e1n of the Jh\u00e1l\u00f3r family. The town lying low is hidden and commanded by a circle of hillocks. It is surrounded by a brick and mortar wall, built in 1750 (Samvat 1806) by Diw\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1nji (1743-1781), from seventeen to twenty feet high, six feet thick, and about three miles round, with seven bastioned gateways, and, at the corners, round towers armed with guns. Though in fair repair the defences are useless against the attack of a modern army.\u2075 Close to the town are two suburbs J\u00e1mpura, near the Ganth\u00e1man, and T\u00e1jpura, near the Delhi gate, the whole surrounded by a ditch once twelve feet deep and twenty-two broad. The houses are irregular and closely packed, and, with few exceptions, the streets and lanes are narrow and dirty. The supply of water, chiefly from wells is unwholesome, charged with vegetable oil. Nothing is done to keep the town clean. The public health is not good, lung diseases and fevers being very prevalent. P\u00e1lanpur is a very old settlement. It is mentioned in the eighth century (746) as the place where Vanr\u00e1j (746-806), the founder of the Ch\u00e1vda dynasty of Anhilv\u00e1da, was brought up.\u2076 Early in the thirteenth century it appears as Prahl\u00e1dan P\u00e1tan the capital of Prahl\u00e1dan Dev of the Parm\u00e1r house of Chandr\u00e1vati.\u2077 Afterwards falling waste, it was in the fourteenth century re-peopled by P\u00e1lansi Choh\u00e1n, from whom it takes its present name. Early in the seventeenth century the Choh\u00e1ns were displaced by the Musalm\u00e1n rulers of Jh\u00e1l\u00f3r. And later on (1698), when driven from their own seat, the Jh\u00e1l\u00f3r\n\n\u00b9 Political Agent, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r.

Diw\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1nji, who ruled from 1743 to 1781, extended the limits of the state by taking the Sirohi lands of Dhanera, Mal\u00e1na, Surbakri, Dabhela, and Sarotra. In 1813 the Sindian garrison assassinated the Diw\u00e1n, Firoz Kh\u00e1n, imprisoned his wife and son, and raised to power the chief of Deesa. By British interference the succession was decided, and, after a tedious negociation, the town, on the 15th December 1813, surrendered without resistance to Colonel Holmes and a British detachment. The Sindian garrison was expelled, and, to keep order, a body of Bombay Native Infantry under European officers was for a time left in garrison.\n\nIn 1813 a census showed a total of 6100 houses, 800 belonging to V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, 200 to Kanbis, 100 to M\u00e1lis and K\u00e1chhi\u00e1s, 1600 to Kasb\u00e1ti Musalm\u00e1ns, 200 to Sindians, and 3200 to craftsmen. In 1872, of 17,189 souls, 5146 or 29\u00b794 per cent were Hindus, 6035 or 35\u00b711 per cent Musalm\u00e1ns, 5992 or 34\u00b786 per cent Jains, and 16 or 0\u00b709 per cent \u2018Others\u2019. Musalm\u00e1ns and Jains form the bulk of the population. The Musalm\u00e1ns, many of them in the service of the state, are generally poor; the Jains are traders and as a class are prosperous and well-to-do. Of artisans, carpenters, blacksmiths and bricklayers are in fair condition, and tailors and oil-pressers poor, forced, in turn, with very little or no pay, to work for the chief, his relations, and state officers. The carpenters make good articles both of plain and ornamental wood work, and the blacksmiths, well tempered knives and swords. The local manufacture of perfumes, the essential oils of the ch\u00e1mpa Michelia champaca and the keeda Pandanus odoratissimus, is important enough to bring traders from M\u00e1rw\u00e1r and other places. At present a place of no great traffic, the opening of the Western Rajput\u00e1na State Railway will, before long, make P\u00e1lanpur a considerable trade centre. Its chief exports are clarified butter, sesamum, rapeseed, honey, and wax, and its chief imports, iron, groceries, molasses, tobacco, ivory, and cloth. Besides the offices of the Political Superintendent, his two assistants, and the principal state officials, there are a hospital, a post, and telegraph offices. A travellers\u2019 bungalow is being built. A municipality has lately been started, and a road begun between the railway station and the town. A sum of \u00a3120 (Rs. 1200) was, in 1878, set apart by the chief for the use of the town. But as yet there are no regular funds and nothing has been done to repair, water, or light the roads. In the town are four Jain temples and seven mosques, none of them of any special interest. Outside the walls are two Hindu temples and two rest-houses, and the tombs of former chiefs and their families, small richly carved mausoleums, roz\u00e1s, in Musalm\u00e1n style. Of the Hindu temples that of P\u00e1t\u00e1leshvar Mah\u00e1dev, so called from being under ground, is said to have been built by Sidhr\u00e1j Jaysing (1094 - 1143) of P\u00e1tan, who, according to the local story, was born at P\u00e1lanpur.\n\n---\n\n1 Hamilton's Description of Hindust\u00e1n, I. 627.\n2 Hamilton's Description of Hindust\u00e1n, I. 626.\nPanchasar, a small town in the extreme south-west of the Superintendency, about thirty miles south of Radhanpur, is one of the oldest seats of power in north-west Gujar\u00e1t. During the seventh century it was the capital of Jai Shikhri of the Chavda or Chapotkat clan, and was so splendid a city that, according to the court bard, no one living there had any desire for Paradise. This boasting of his bard brought against Jai Shikhri (697) the power of the king of Kalyan Katak. The first expedition, surprised by Jai Shikhri's minister, was defeated, but a second, under the personal command of the Kalyan king, ended in the destruction of Jai Shikhri and of his capital. His wife, saved by her husband's forethought, became the mother of Vanrai, the founder (746) of the city of Anhilvada. At Rantoj and Sankeshvar near Panchasar are Jain temples more than once re-built, and probably holding the same sites since very early times. During the last seven years (1872-1879) by the completion, within twenty miles, of the railway to Patri the trade of Panchasar has increased, and a steam cotton ginning factory has been opened.\n\nRadhanpur, north latitude 23\u00b0 50', east longitude 71\u00b0 31', the seat of the Nawab of Radhanpur, a Musalm\u00e1n of the Babi family, had, in 1872, a population of 13,190 souls. Standing in a wide open plain mostly under water during the rains, it is surrounded by a part stone part brick loopholed wall fifteen feet high, eight feet broad, and about two and a half miles round, with corner towers, eight bastioned gateways, outworks and a ditch now filled up. Against modern arms the wall gives little shelter, and could be easily taken either by escalade or battery. There is also, surrounded by a wall, an inner fort or castle, called Rajghadi, where the Nawab lives. Of public buildings there are twenty-four Jain and ten Brahman temples, and ten mosques. Of the Jain temples some are large and richly carved with coloured marble floors. There are also some small well-carved tombs of former Nawabs. One of pure marble in memory of the late Nawab, Zoravar Khanji, is nearly finished. Except a wide and clean main street, the town roads, little better than lanes, are narrow and rather dirty. The water-supply, taken from ponds and wells, becomes a\n\n---\n\n1 Ras Mala, 20. Many of the leading people of Valabhi in east Kathiawar are, on the fall of their city, said to have retreated to Panchasar. If there is any truth in the legend, Valabhi must have been more than once sacked, as the final fall of Panchasar (Ras Mala, 13-18) was about 700, and of Valabhi about fifty years later. See Burgess' Arch. Rep. (1874-75), 85.\n\n2 Dr. B\u00fchler (Ind. Ant. VI. 182-184) has given reasons for believing that this Kalyan is a city of Kanauj and not of the Deccan. Two points in the Ratan Mala account of the war between Kalyan and Panchasar support Dr. B\u00fchler's view. Kalyan is said to be so fine a city that the sun spends half the year in the north and half in the south, with the sole purpose of comparing the capital city of Ceylon with Kalyan. The writer, a Gujarati Brahman would not have spoken of the Deccan Kalyan as a city of the north (Ras Mala, 20). Again on their way to Sorath the Kalyan army passed south through the Abu defiles (Ras Mala, 21).\n\n3 Ras Mala, 20-30.\n\n4 The ditch is mentioned by Tieffenthaler (1750), who calls Radhanpur a great city, surrounded by a brick wall, strengthened by towers with a ditch and fortress.

Though subject to very great extremes of cold and heat, the climate of R\u00e1dhanpur is, except in September and October, healthy. In (May) 1816\\(^1\\) and again in the beginning of 1820,\\(^2\\) a disease, in many symptoms the same as the true plague or pestis, and called by the natives w\u00e1ba or w\u00e1ba-o-t\u00e1'aun, visited R\u00e1dhanpur, and carried away about one-half of its population.\\(^3\\) Like the 1815 outbreak at Kanthkot in the east of Cutch, slight fever was followed by great weakness and weariness, and then swellings came in the groin and armpits suppurating in some cases and in others remaining hard lumps. Few stricken with the disease recovered. Besides dregs of famine, several causes were thought to have helped to develop this disease. The marshes at the top of the Cambay Gulf were more than usually feverish; the people were filthy, neither washing nor oiling, wearing immense quantities of clothes, the lower classes never changing them till they rotted off; the towns were overcrowded, hemmed in by walls and thick hedges, filled with listless idlers and diseased cattle.\\(^4\\)\n\nThe name R\u00e1dhanpur is said to come from R\u00e1dhan Kh\u00e1n, a descendant of Fate Kh\u00e1n Baloch, who, under the Ahmedabad Sult\u00e1ns, held this with other grants. According to another tradition the town is as old as 546, and was originally called R\u00e1dandevpur, from R\u00e1dan Dev a Ch\u00e1vda chief.\\(^5\\) Since the defeat of Jaw\u00e1n Mard Kh\u00e1n B\u00e1bi at Ahmedabad in 1753, R\u00e1dhanpur has been the head-quarters of a branch of the great B\u00e1bi family.\\(^6\\) The present Naw\u00e1b Bismil\u00e1h Kh\u00e1n\u00ed belongs to the B\u00e1bi family. The founder of this family B\u00e1bi Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n, came from Ispah\u00e1n in Persia about 300 years ago, and, during the time of the Emperor Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n of Delhi, came to Gujar\u00e1t and entered the service of Sult\u00e1n Muza\u00edffar Kh\u00e1n Gujar\u00e1ti of Ahmedabad. The Naw\u00e1bs of Jun\u00e1gad and B\u00e1lasinor also belong to this family. In 1680 A.D. Safdar Kh\u00e1n, grandson of Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n, obtained as an estate, j\u00e1ghir, the district of Thar\u00e1d. In 1813 a disputed succession was settled by the intervention of the British Government, and it was agreed that the Naw\u00e1bs should admit the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r's supremacy.\\(^7\\) The British first concluded an engagement with R\u00e1dhanpur in 1813, in which year Captain Carnac, the Resident of Baroda, concluded an engagement with it, whereby the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r Government, under the advice of the British Government, was empowered to control its foreign relations, and help in defending it from invasion. In 1819, to aid R\u00e1dhanpur against the Khos\u00e1s a predatory tribe from Sind, Colonel Barklay marched from Gujar\u00e1t, and in 1822 Major Miles, who accompanied\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Bombay Gazetteer, IV. 220.\n\n\\(^2\\) Mr. Orton in Trans.

This continued for three years, when, (1825) considering the state unable to pay so large an amount, the British Government remitted it in full. Since then R\u00e1dhanpur has been free from all British claims.\n\nIn 1820 the town had 6000 houses, 1400 of them inhabited by V\u00e1nias and money changers. In 1828 it was said to be a good station for troops, with a large trade, and a population of not less than 15,000 souls. In 1872, of a total population of 13,910 souls, 5946 or 42.75 per cent were Hindus, 4586 or 32.97 per cent Musalm\u00e1ns, and 3378 or 24.28 per cent Jains. Of these the Musalm\u00e1ns, most of them soldiers and constables, are poor, and the Jains are prosperous and well-to-do traders. In 1820 though the roads were greatly infested by plundering Kolis, R\u00e1dhanpur was an emporium of the M\u00e1rv\u00e1r and Cutch trade with among its traders men of property and extensive commerce. The chief exports were clarified butter, wheat, and hides, the butter sent to Cutch, the wheat and hides to Bh\u00e1vnagar. Except of very coarse cloth for the Kolis there was no manufacture. At present the only local crafts of any importance are the weaving of coarse cotton cloth by Dheds and Bohor\u00e1s, and the manufacture of brass vessels by Kans\u00e1r\u00e1s. The largest town in this part of Gujar\u00e1t, R\u00e1dhanpur is a rather important local trade centre. The chief imports are rice, molasses, tobacco, cloth, metals, grocery, and ivory; and the chief exports, rapeseed, wheat, gram, and cotton. The nearest railway station is forty miles off at Kh\u00e1r\u00e1ghoda near P\u00e1tri. Besides the principal state offices there are a post office and a dispensary. A municipality has lately been started, with, in 1879, an income of about \u00a370 (Rs. 700), and an expenditure of \u00a3125 (Rs. 1250.) Except one leading to a pleasure garden outside the town, no roads have been made, and nothing has been done towards watering, lighting, or cleaning the town.\n\nSankeshvar, a celebrated Jain shrine twenty-four miles south of R\u00e1dhanpur, has no remains of interest. The present temples are modern raised on the sites of old buildings that have quite disappeared.\n\nSami, north latitude 23\u00b0 40', east longitude 71\u00b0 40', a town, in 1872, of 5486 inhabitants, stands like R\u00e1dhanpur in a low wet plain under water during the rains. It is surrounded by a brick wall about one and a half miles in circumference, twenty-four feet high and twelve wide, now partly in ruins. To the east is a strong stone and brick court, and on the west a building of Nuransha Pir with a lake called the Pir Tal\u00e1v. Besides these, there is a mosque and the tombs of some of the Naw\u00e1bs' families. There are no other buildings\n\n---\n\n1 Hamilton's Description of Hindust\u00e1n, I. 628.\n2 Sir A.

The houses are irregularly built and the streets narrow and dirty. There is no river, the supply of water being from ponds and wells. As in R\u00e1dhanpur, the great plague of 1816 carried off about one-half of its population. According to local tradition Sami takes its name from its founder, an ascetic of the Atit or Sami order. It came under the power of the Naw\u00e1b of R\u00e1dhanpur at the same time (1753) as R\u00e1dhanpur; and at the beginning of the present century was his capital and head-quarters, the heir-apparent living at R\u00e1dhanpur. Of 5486 the total 1872 population, 2804 or 51\u00b711 per cent were Hindus, 2129 or 38\u00b781 per cent Musalm\u00e1ns, and 553 or 10\u00b708 per cent Jains. The bulk of the Musalm\u00e1ns are cultivators and in fair condition. A steam cotton ginning factory has been established at Sami. There are also several families of Dhed hand-loom weavers and Khatri dyers. The imports and exports are the same as at R\u00e1dhanpur. Sami is the head-quarters of one of the R\u00e1dhanpur subordinate officers, vahivatd\u00e1rs, invested with revenue and judicial powers. There is no municipality, dispensary, or post office.\n\nSuiga'm.\n\nSuiga'm, on a small hill six miles from the Ran, with a population in 1872 of 2469 souls and a post office, is the starting point of one of the routes across the Ran to P\u00e1rkar. During the establishment of British power in north Gujar\u00e1t, Suig\u00e1m, with a detachment of Native Infantry under a European officer and a party of Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r horse, was a somewhat important outpost. The country round suffered much from the 1819 earthquake, the whole land becoming salt and the wells useless.\n\nThara'd.\n\nThara'd, north latitude 24\u00b0 20', east longitude 71\u00b0 40', perhaps the oldest town in the P\u00e1lampur Superintendency, on a rising ground in a flat plain is surrounded by a ruined wall. For about six months after the rains, the supply of water is from a pond, and after that from wells brackish and about 100 feet deep. The climate is healthy. The residence of the Thar\u00e1d chief a V\u00e1ghela Rajput, it is the head-quarters of the revenue officer, th\u00e1nd\u00e1r, who collects their payments, jama, from the smaller estate holders. The verse, dohra, about the founding of Thar\u00e1d, states that in 115 (S. 171) Tharpur Parm\u00e1r, leaving Shripur or Bhinm\u00e1l in M\u00e1rw\u00e1r, went to the west and established the city of Thar\u00e1d. The town continued in the hands of the Parm\u00e1rs till the tenth century, when it was taken by Mul Raj Solanki of P\u00e1tan (942-997). In 1275 (S. 1331) Thar\u00e1d was taken by Choh\u00e1n Saregogji Ratansingji of N\u00e1dol in M\u00e1rw\u00e1r, an ancestor of the present R\u00e1na of V\u00e1v.

The country round, with thorns and fruitless trees, yielded only hay and firewood. Nature was sad, gloomy, and silent. Birds and beasts shunned a land without springs, streams, or rivers.

In 1680 Tharad was given to Sher Safdar Khan Babi of Radhanpur, and four years later it was again placed under a deputy of the Ahmedabad Viceroy. In 1736 Chohan Jetmal, younger brother of the Rana of Vav gained possession of Tharad, but through the intrigues of his brother, the Rana, was, by Diwan Bahadur Khan of Palanpur, driven out in the following year. On this he went for help to Radhanpur and the Nawab Kamal-ud-din Khan marched on Tharad and took it, keeping it till, in 1759, it was given in charge to the ancestor of the present chief, Vaghela Khani of Morvada, a man of much ability and energy whose family claimed kindred with the Vaghela rulers of Patan (1243-1304).\n\nIn 1820, Tharad was a town of 2700 houses, 300 of them inhabited by Vanias, and the rest by Kolis, Rajputs, and Sindians. It was surrounded by a wall and ditch, the latter about thirty feet wide, both in bad repair. It was locally thought a place of great strength and was a sufficient defence against predatory horse. Except the court-house and the Parishat temples it contained few good buildings. Of 2514, the total 1872 population, 1142 or 45.43 per cent, including 894 Jains, were Hindus, and 478 or 19.01 per cent Musalmans. The leading classes of Hindus are Vanias and Rajputs, and of Musalmans, Memans. The Vania and Meman traders are well-to-do; the Rajput and other husbandmen middling. Tharad has no special manufacture. Its chief exports are grain, clarified butter, sesamum seed, and oxen; its chief imports, cloth, molasses, grocery, and tobacco. A rural messenger serves letters at Tharad and Vav from the post office at Suigam. Except the Thakor's residence, eight Jain and four Brahman temples, three mosques, one a converted temple, and the thandar's office, there are no brick and cement buildings, the people believing that the owner of a brick-built house dies childless. Outside the town is an old Hindu temple with an illegible inscription cut in stone. According to the local story, about 600 years ago before Chohan Ratansing was driven out of Nadol, his family goddess Ashapura commanded him to leave Nadol, and, going westward, to settle in a place where the rope of his wagon should break. Starting off, the rope broke near Tharad. Here he stopped, and, in time, subduing the country round built a temple, calling it in honour of his goddess Nan Devi.\n\nVadhia'r, 'originally Vriddhikar the land of grass or herdsmen,' is bounded on the north by Radhanpur, on the east by Bauchraji, on the south by Patri, and on the west by the Ran. Except for its hamlets, each with its group of trees, it is flat and barren, in character much like the Ran. When brought under British management (1820), it was famous for its grass, fowls, sheep, and horses. At that time it was much infested by bands of plundering\n\n---\n\n1 Hamilton's Description of Hindustan, I. 624.\n2 Hamilton's Description of Hindustan, I. 628.

It is of historic interest as the first seat of the family of Ch\u00e1vda, or Chapotkat Rajputs, who, in 746, founded the city of Anhilv\u00e1da. The site of their first capital is still preserved in the village of Panch\u00e1sar. At R\u00e1ntoj and Sankeshvar near Panch\u00e1sar are Jain temples more than once rebuilt, but, probably, occupying their present sites from a very early date, and at Vishodra and other places are vestiges of ancient towns like those found at Valleh.\n\nVa'ghel, or Vya'ghrapalli, a village twenty-five miles southeast of Radhanpur, was the chief place in a grant of land made by Kum\u00e1r P\u00e1l Solanki (1143-1174) to his cousin Anak the grandfather of Vir Dhaval, who about 1243 founded the V\u00e1gheha dynasty (1243-1304) of Anhilv\u00e1da. There is a small temple with a single open entrance hall, mandap, one story high, with pyramid roof, three porticoes, and a spire-surmounted shrine. There are also some very curious monumental stones, p\u00e1l\u00edas, with spirited deep cut carvings on all four sides and with tops cut in the form of a temple spire. They have much in common with the more ambitious cupolas, chhatris, and seem to come between them and the ordinary memorial stones.\n\nV\u00e1v, north latitude 24\u00b0 18', east longitude 71\u00b0 37', an unwalled town with, in 1872, a population of 3065 souls, stands on rising ground in a flat country. For some months after the rains the supply of water is from ponds, and, when the ponds are dry, from wells, whose water in the latter part of the hot season becomes slightly brackish. V\u00e1v is the residence of the R\u00e1na of V\u00e1v a Choh\u00e1n Rajput who claims kindred with Pruthuraj the last of the Choh\u00e1n kings of Delhi (1193). It is also the head-quarters of a subordinate officer, th\u00e1nd\u00e1r, placed over the estates of the cadets of the R\u00e1na's house. The streets are narrow and the houses irregular. The V\u00e1v family came to Gujar\u00e1t from S\u00e1mbhar and N\u00e1dol in M\u00e1rv\u00e1r. Their ancestor R\u00e1na Ratansing, driven out of N\u00e1dol (1103), settled at Thar\u00e1d, then under the Solanki Rajputs of P\u00e1tan. R\u00e1na Punja, the sixth in descent from Ratansing, was killed by the Musalm\u00e1ns (1283). Afterwards R\u00e1na Vaja his son, through the influence of his father-in-law the R\u00e1val of Jesalmir, with the exception of the town of Thar\u00e1d, regained his estate by a grant from the Delhi Emperor. Forced to choose a new capital, he fixed on a place about seven miles west of Thar\u00e1d, called V\u00e1v from a step-well built by his great grandfather R\u00e1na Mehp\u00e1lji. V\u00e1v has ever since remained in the hands of his descendants. In 1809 it contained not fewer than 1000 Rajput families of rank and credit and was more populous than Thar\u00e1d. It suffered very severely from the 1813 famine, and, in\n\n---\n\n1 Hamilton's Description of Hindust\u00e1n, I. 628.\n2 R\u00e1s M\u00e1l\u00e1, 28.\n3 R\u00e1s M\u00e1l\u00e1, 28.\n4 Forbes in the R\u00e1s M\u00e1l\u00e1 makes Bhim Dev II.'s reign end in 1215.

Of 3065, the total population, 2310 or 75\u00b737 per cent, including 558 Jains, were Hindus, and 200 or 6\u00b752 per cent Musalm\u00e1ns. There is a large class of Rajput husbandmen in fair condition, and the V\u00e1nia traders and Khatri dyers are well-to-do. The trade is much the same as in Thar\u00e1d, and there is no special manufacture. There is no municipality, dispensary, or post office at V\u00e1v, letters being served by a rural messenger who carries them to and from the post office at Suig\u00e1m. Besides three Hindu and two Jain temples, two mosques and the R\u00e1za's residence, there are about twenty-five well built houses belonging to V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, Rajputs, and Musalm\u00e1ns. None of them call for special mention.\n\n1 Sir A. Burnes' MS. 1st April 1828.\nMAHI K\u00c1NTHA.\nNOTE.

The lands, stretching, in spite of their name, north from the Mahi about 100 miles to the Sarasvati, are distributed over fifty-nine states and properties, and yield a gross yearly revenue of a little over \u00a375,000 (Rs. 7,50,000). Of the fifty-nine territorial divisions, Idar is a state of the first class, with a population of 271,382 souls, and, exclusive of its dependencies, a yearly revenue of \u00a325,000 (Rs. 2,50,000). Of the rest eleven are states of some consequence, with an average population of over 8000 souls and a yearly revenue of about \u00a32000 (Rs. 20,000); and forty-seven are small estates, with an average population of about 3000 souls and a revenue of about \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000).\n\nLying in the extreme north-east corner of the Bombay Presidency the Mahi K\u00e1ntha is bounded on the north by the mountainous Bhil districts of Sirohi and Meyw\u00e1r; on the east by Dungarpur, B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor, Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da and Kaira; on the south by the Rewa K\u00e1ntha states of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da and B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor, by the British districts of Kaira and Ahmedabad, and by the Dehgam and Atarsumba districts of His Highness the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r; and on the west by the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r districts of Kher\u00e1lu, Vadnagar, V\u00edj\u00e1pur, Kadi, and P\u00e1tan, and by P\u00e1l\u00e1npur. Its extreme length is about ninety, and its greatest breadth about sixty miles.\n\nThe Mahi K\u00e1ntha territory is distributed over the six following sub-divisions: 1, N\u00e1n\u00ed M\u00e1rv\u00e1d, or Little M\u00e1rv\u00e1r, so called because it includes the possessions of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja of Idar and other M\u00e1rv\u00e1di Rajputs; 2, Rehvar, the possessions of the Rehvar tribe of Rajputs, formerly cadets, pat\u00e1vats, of the Idar family; 3, V\u00e1trak K\u00e1ntha, the Koli possessions on both sides of the V\u00e1trak river; 4, S\u00e1b\u00e1r K\u00e1ntha, the Koli possessions on the east bank of the S\u00e1barmati, with the Rajput districts of Varsoda, M\u00e1nasa, and Peth\u00e1p\u00far on the west bank; 5, B\u00e1visi including the Rajput district of V\u00e1sna and a large number of Koli villages, formerly part of the\nChapter I.\n\nDescription.\n\nG\u00e1ikw\u00e1r district of Dehg\u00e1m which were handed over to the Agency on account of the unruly character of its people; and 6, Katosan, composed entirely of Koli possessions.\n\nAspect.\n\nStretching from the hilly eastern border into the level centre of Gujar\u00e1t, the Mahi K\u00e1ntha plain includes tracts of land differing widely in character and appearance. In the north and east the country is rough and wild, broken by ranges of steep well-wooded hills, and crossed by rivers whose banks are cut into deep difficult ravines. The people, both the Bhils of the border hills and the Kolis of the rugged river banks, are idle and unruly, and large tracts of arable land lie waste. To the south and west the land falls till, near S\u00e1dra and Ahmednagar, it is not 400 feet above the sea. Here, except along the lines of the rivers whose banks are deeply seamed with ravines, the country is level, well-wooded, and most of it tilled.\n\nHills.\n\nThough with no peaks or hills of special interest, in the north and east are steep and craggy granite ranges covered with trees, bamboos, and brushwood.\n\nRivers.\n\nThere are seven chief Mahi K\u00e1ntha rivers: the Sarasvati, S\u00e1barmati, H\u00e1thmati, Kh\u00e1ri, Meshva, M\u00e1jam, and V\u00e1trak. These all rising in the eastern highlands and passing south-west, though they flow during the whole year, have none of them enough volume of water to be of use for boat traffic. The waters of only one of them, the H\u00e1thmati, have as yet been used for irrigation on any large scale.\n\nThe Sarasvati.\n\nBeginning in the north, the first river is the Sarasvati. Rising in the hills above D\u00e1nta it passes south-west, and after a course of about 112 miles loses itself in the sands to the south-east of the Ran of Cutch. Within Mahi K\u00e1ntha limits, for about forty miles, it passes close to and almost parallel with the north-west boundary of the district.\n\nThe S\u00e1barmati.\n\nAbout fifteen miles south of the Sarasvati comes the S\u00e1bar, or, as it is called after meeting the H\u00e1thmati, the S\u00e1barmati, the largest and most important of the Mahi K\u00e1ntha rivers. Of its course of 200 miles from the Meyw\u00e1r hills south-west to the gulf of Cambay, about sixty lie within Mahi K\u00e1ntha limits, forty of them crossing the district from north-east to south-west, and twenty skirting its western boundary. During the Mahi K\u00e1ntha part of its course the river flows between high rugged banks, over a bed rocky in the east, and in the western plain broad and sandy, yielding crops of wheat in the cold and of melons in the hot season. In the hot and cold seasons and in the rains, except during freshes, the river can be forded at many places. For use in times of flood, a ferry boat is kept at S\u00e1dra. The bed of the river lies too deep for the water to be\n\n---\n\n1 The irrigation returns give 381\u00bd feet above ordinary Surat spring tides.\n2 'The Mahi K\u00e1utha,' wrote Mr. Elphinstone in 1821, 'though so much of it is neglected shows great fertility wherever it is cultivated. The fields seem well taken care of, and covered with fine crops. Mangoes and other planted trees are unusually numerous, and as the surface is undulating and the woods and mountains open in sight, no part of India presents a richer or more agreeable prospect.' Minute 28th February 1821.\ndrawn off by canals, but in the cold season temporary wells are sunk in the bed near the banks, and their water used for irrigation.\n\nAbout twenty-five miles south of the S\u00e1barmati, the H\u00e1thmati, rising from the Meyw\u00e1r hills beyond P\u00e1l, passes south-west for about thirty-five miles through the Mahi K\u00e1ntha, falling into the S\u00e1barmati below Ahmednagar. Flowing throughout the year the stream of the H\u00e1thmati passes, like the S\u00e1barmati, between high rough banks, first over a rocky and then through a sandy bed. Between 1869 and 1873 close above Ahmednagar a weir was built across the river, and so much of its water as was not wanted for the use of the people of Ahmednagar and other places on its banks, was taken to feed a canal for irrigating the lands of Par\u00e1ntij in Ahmedabad.\n\nThe Kh\u00e1ri, a small stream, rising in the centre of the Mahi K\u00e1ntha, in the northern part of the Mohanpur district, takes a south-westerly course for about 105 miles, and joins the S\u00e1barmati near Dholka.\n\nThe Meshva rises in the Meyw\u00e1r hills on the north-east frontier of Mahi K\u00e1ntha, and running parallel to the Kh\u00e1ri, passes Harsol, and after a course of about 126 miles joins the V\u00e1trak near Kaira.\n\nThe M\u00e1jam rises in the hills between Dungarpur and the Mahi K\u00e1ntha, and passing about sixty-six miles south-west through Mod\u00e1sa and Vad\u00e1g\u00e1m, joins the V\u00e1trak a few miles below \u00c1mliy\u00e1ra. Its bed is in many places rocky.\n\nThe V\u00e1trak rises in the hills south of Dungarpur and passing south-west by Meghraj, M\u00e1lpur, and M\u00e1ndva is joined by the M\u00e1jam, Meshva, and other streams, and after a course of about 151 miles falls into the S\u00e1barmati near Dholka. In the eastern part of its course it flows over a rocky bed between rough banks through a wild and picturesque country.\n\nBesides these main rivers two or three small streams rise in the southern part of the province and, near Kapadvanj, fall into the Mohar, a tributary of the V\u00e1trak.\n\nWith a well-marked fall from the north-east to the south-west the country is thoroughly drained. Besides the rivers, there is in a line of low ground, between the Meshva and the M\u00e1jam, a succession of pools and marshes. This hollow, beginning as high up as Moduka and passing Amb\u00e1sar, Lemb, Untarda, Tenpur, \u00c1mliy\u00e1ra, Bhund\u00e1san, D\u00e1bha, and Ganeshpur, carries the surface waters into the river Meshva.\n\nThough with no natural lakes the district is well supplied with ponds and wells. There are many ponds, but though some of them hold water throughout the year they are little used except for cattle. Among the number there are four of special size. Of these the R\u00e1ni Tal\u00e1v, half a mile to the north-east of Idar, has an area of ninety-four acres and a greatest depth of seventeen feet. Its supply lasts throughout the year but is not used for irrigation. The east side of the lake is banked with masonry steps. It is said, but this is doubtful, to have been dug and built about 250 years\nago by the wife of R\u00e1o Bh\u00e1n, chief of Idar. The Karm\u00e1b\u00e1vi Tal\u00e1v north of S\u00e1ml\u00e1ji, has an area of 134 acres and a greatest depth of fifteen feet. Its supply lasts throughout the year, but is not used for irrigation. It is said to have been dug by a hermit\u2019s hands unaided by tools. Only eighty-eight feet of the south side are banked with masonry steps. The B\u00e1bsur Tal\u00e1v, near B\u00e1bsur, has an area of 182 acres, and a greatest depth of fifteen feet. Its water lasts throughout the year, and is, to a very small extent, used for irrigation. It has neither retaining masonry walls nor approaches. The Hadd\u00e1 Tal\u00e1v, one mile east of Had\u00e1d, has an area of seventy-nine acres. Its water lasts only eight months, but is used, to a small extent, for irrigation. It has neither retaining masonry walls nor approaches. This lake burst its banks during the rains of 1875, and, as it has not been repaired, is still a wreck.\n\nThere are two kinds of soil in the Mahi K\u00e1ntha, one light and sandy, the other black; both of them are very rich. On the north and east frontiers are steep craggy hills of pink or gray granite, marked by very large felspar crystals, but not fit for building. Except near and to the east of Ahmednagar, where it crosses the river and can be traced south to the Panch Mah\u00e1ls, this granite is found only north of the H\u00e1thmati. A very superior calciferous sandstone found at Ahmednagar is much used all over Gujar\u00e1t in building temples and mosques.\n\nExcept that the uplands in the north and east are cooler, the climate is much the same as in the other parts of Gujar\u00e1t. The cold weather begins late in October with chilly mornings and evenings. During November, December, January, and February, the climate is particularly pleasant. December and January are the two coldest months. About March it begins to grow warm, and by the end of March or the beginning of April the hot weather fairly sets in. About the first week in June the heat becomes very oppressive, and clouds gather but rain seldom falls in any considerable quantity. The bulk of the rain falls in July and the early part of September. From March to June the prevailing wind is from the west and north-west, from July to September from the south-west, and from October to February from the north and north-east. During the twenty years ending 1878, the average rainfall was 30\u00b761 inches,\u00b9 the highest fall in any one year being 35\u00b705 inches in 1862, and the lowest 18\u00b736 inches in 1877.

At Ahmednagar, Savgad and Parbada, in the Idar state, a very superior calciferous sandstone is quarried, and much used all over Gujar\u00e1t for ornamental public buildings.\\(^1\\) Its trade value varies in the case of ordinary stone from \\(4\\frac{1}{2}\\) d. to 2s. (3 as.-Re. 1), and in the case of grindstones, from 2s. to 4s. (Re. 1-2) the cubic foot. The quarries yield the Idar state a yearly revenue of about \u00a3300 (Rs. 3000). At Bet\u00e1li in Idar, from a dark-grey stone, very superior white cement, chuna, is made. Near D\u00e1nta there are some quarries of an inferior kind of marble. Tale is found in quantities in the bed of the H\u00e1thmati, in the districts of H\u00e1pa and T\u00e1jpuri, in the S\u00e1bar K\u00e1ntha, and at Adpodra in Mohanpur.\n\nOf hedge and field trees the following are the chief: mahuda, Bassia latifolia; the mango tree, \u00e1mba, Mangifera indica; r\u00e1yan, Mimusops indica; the banyan or Indian fig tree, vad, Ficus bengalensis; and the \u00e1sop\u00e1lav, Polyalthea longiflora. The mahuda flower is largely used for making country liquor. The chief forest trees are the bastard teak, kh\u00e1kho, Butea frondosa; the wood apple, kothi, Feronia elephantum; the jambul, j\u00e1mbud\u00ed, Eugenia jambolana; the nimb, l\u00edmdo, Melia azadirachta; and the teak, s\u00e1g, Tectona grandis.\n\nThough with large tracts of more or less wooded hill-land, Mahi K\u00e1ntha has no important revenue-yielding forests. The hills are chiefly covered with bamboos, brushwood, and teak. Except at Esri, where there are some fine teak trees reserved by the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja of Idar, the teak is generally uncared for, and cut down before it grows to any size. The chief forest products are gum and honey.\n\nOf domestic animals the Mahi K\u00e1ntha bullocks, worth from \u00a31 12s. to \u00a320 (Rs. 16-200) a pair, are smaller and weaker than those of K\u00e1nkrej in P\u00e1lanpur. They are reared by all classes of husbandmen,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) It was chiefly from the Idar quarries that the mosques and temples of Ahmedabad were built. The cement was also famous, showing as bright as marble. 'In the mountainous country about Idar, there is a quarry of white stone, which is procurable in no other part. The lime made from this is made in stucco work, for the walls or terraces of buildings, and for fine edifices, pleasure-houses, and mausoleum. If employed in plastering, it takes so fine a polish as to reflect the light as a looking-glass. When in the reign of Firdaus-Ashi\u00e1n\u00ed-Sh\u00e1h-Jah\u00e1n, the royal buildings of the citadel of Sh\u00e1hijah\u00e1nah\u00e1b (Delhi) were repaired, the lime made from this stone was taken from Gujar\u00e1t by the king's order, and used in their construction. The mausoleums of the Muhammadan saints, the temples of the Hindus, and other public works are erected with this lime; as are also numerous canals, water reservoirs, wells, and other like buildings.' Bird's Mir\u00e1t-i-Ahmadi, 106.\nand are set to work when four years old. In ploughing and working wells one pair is used, and in drawing carts with a load of from 1200 to 1600 pounds (30-40 mans), from two to four pairs. Bh\u00e1ts and Vanj\u00e1r\u00e1s have pack bullocks, who carry grain and salt in a long bag with a mouth in the middle, thrown across a saddle, pal\u00e1n, of rope and cotton rags. Pack bullocks, except that they are sometimes given a little salt, are left to pick up what they can. Other bullocks are stall-fed on grass and oilcake, khol, with, in a few cases, grain, grass, and spices, mas\u00e1l\u00e1.\n\nCows, worth from 10s. to \u00a32 (Rs. 5 - 20), have their first calf when five or six years old, and generally live to the age of twelve to fifteen. After each calf, from seven to ten months, they give from two to five pints, sers, of milk a day. When in milk, cows are fed on grain and grass, their monthly keep costing about 10s. (Rs. 5) in towns and 6s. (Rs. 3) in villages. Among townspeople, when a cow stops giving milk, the calf is made over to some herdsman or husbandman. When grown it is valued, and on paying one-half of its price either the owner or the rearer may keep it. Rab\u00e1ris, Bhils, and Kol\u00eds, are the chief cattle breeders.\n\nFemale buffaloes, worth from \u00a32 to \u00a36 (Rs. 20-60), have their first calf at from five to six, and live to be fifteen or twenty. After each calf for twelve months they give from five to ten pints, sers, of milk a day. They are fed on grass, oilcake, and grain, their monthly keep costing about 16s. (Rs. 8) in towns and 10s. (Rs. 5) in villages. The arrangements for rearing town-grown buffaloes are the same as those for rearing cows. All husbandmen breed buffaloes. Except about one in each village kept for stud purposes, and the pack buffaloes of the Thor\u00eds, a tribe of wandering basketmakers, male buffaloes are of no use. Bhils let them grow and sometimes kill them for food. Other classes let them starve, or soon after birth suffocate them under baskets.\n\nSheep, almost all of one sort, and worth from 4s. to 6s. (Rs. 2-3), are reared by Bharv\u00e1ds and Rab\u00e1ris. Their milk is drunk or made into butter. They are twice sheared about April, Cha\u00edtra, and October, Ashvin, and the wool sold. Few sheep are killed in the district, but they are bought and sent to Ahmedabad and Bombay. Some of the chiefs keep fighting rams; they do not belong to a special breed.\n\nGoats, of one breed, and worth from 4s. to 8s. (Rs. 2 - 4), are reared by Bharv\u00e1ds and Rab\u00e1ris. Their milk is made into butter, and they are shorn at the same time as sheep. Most of the hair is sold and exported. They are seldom killed.\n\nCamels, worth from \u00a32 to \u00a310 (Rs. 20 - 100), are reared by Rab\u00e1ris and Bharv\u00e1ds, and used both for riding and carrying loads. Except some kept for riding, who are stall-fed on grain at a monthly cost of about 10s. (Rs. 5), camels live on tree leaves.\n\nHorses, worth from \u00a37 10s. to \u00a320 (Rs. 75 - 200), are reared for riding by Rajputs and others. Their monthly keep, grass and gram, costs from 16s. to \u00a31 10s. (Rs. 8-15).\nAsses, worth from 16s. to \u00a31 10s. (Rs. 8 - 15), are reared and used for carrying loads by Kumbh\u00e1rs, potters, R\u00e1val\u00edas, grain-carriers, Dhobhis, washermen, Thoris, basketmakers, and V\u00e1dis, jugglers. Potters' asses generally have some chaff, bhusa; the rest are left to pick up what they can.\n\nHens, worth from 6d. to 1s. (4 - 8 annas), and all of one breed, are reared and eaten by Muhammadans, \u00c1njna, and D\u00e1ngi Kanbis, Kolis, and Bhils. Among flesh-eating classes Rajputs have a special dislike to fowls. Eggs are sold at 2\u00bdd. (1\u00bd annas) the dozen. Neither ducks, turkeys, nor guinea-fowls are reared. Pea-fowls abound in bushlands and in the outskirts of villages. But as they are sacred to Krishna, Hindus of all classes think it wrong to kill them.\n\nOf wild animals the chief are the Tiger, v\u00e1g\u00e1h, Felis tigris; the Bear, rinchh, Ursus labiatus; the Panther, d\u00edpdo, Felis leopardus; the Wolf, varu, Canis pallipes; the Wild Boar, dukkar, Sus indicus; the Hyena, taras, Hy\u00e6na striata; the Jackal, s\u00edd\u00e1l, Canis aureus; and the Fox, lokdi, Vulpes bengalensis. The following are also found: the Stag, s\u00famb\u00e1r, Russa aristotelis; the Spotted Deer, chit\u00e1l, Axis maculatus; the Antelope, kalid\u00e1r, Antilope bezoartica; the Indian Gazelle, chink\u00e1ra, Gazella bennettii; the Porcupine, s\u00e1hudi, Hystrix cristata; the Leopard, chitta, Felis jubatus; the Four-Horned Antelope, bhekar, Tetraceros quadricornis; the Otter, p\u00e1nim\u00ed bil\u00e1di, Lutra vulgaris; the Blue Bull, nilg\u00e1i, Portax pictus; the Alligator, magar; the Monkey, v\u00e1ndro; the Wild Cat, jangl\u00ed bil\u00e1do, Felis chaus; and the Hare, saslo, Lepus ruficandatus. Snakes of all sizes and sorts, poisonous and harmless, are met with. The big game is being killed off. In the parts inhabited by them the Bhils join together in bands, and hunt down any big game. The Government rewards for killing the most mischievous wild beasts are for a full-grown tiger, \u00a32 8s. (Rs. 24); for a tiger cub, 12s. (Rs. 6); for a panther, \u00a31 4s. (Rs. 12); for a bear, 12s. (Rs. 6); for a wolf, 10s. (Rs. 5); for a hyena, 10s. (Rs. 5); and for a cobra-de-capello, 6d. (4 annas). During 1874-75 two persons were killed by tigers, and twenty-three by snake-bite. Jungle fowl, wild duck, snipe, green pigeons, rock-grouse, partridges, bustards, and floricans are the chief game birds.\n\nThough there are no regular fisheries the rivers are well stocked with Maral, Vanja, Naqori, Rohia, Kudna, P\u00e1hdi, Bagna, Sing\u00e1li, Ran, Jurevar chhoti, Kauchi, Gobri, Chilva, Vamsa, and Bekar.\nCHAPTER III.\n\nPOPULATION.\n\nAccording to the 1854 census the total population of the district was 311,046 souls or 77.76 to the square mile.\\(^1\\) Of the whole Hindus numbered 298,750 or 96.04 per cent, and Musalmans 12,296 or 3.96 per cent. The 1872 census showed a marked increase in population, the total returns amounting to 447,056 souls or 111.76 to the square mile. Of the total number 427,661 were Hindus, including Bhils and Kolis, 19,372 Musalmans, and 23 Christians. The Bhils were not counted, but a total was struck at the rate of four persons to each household. Of the total population 238,648 were males and 208,408 females, the percentage of males on the total population being 53.38 and of females 46.62. Hindu males numbered 228,347 or 53.39 per cent, and Hindu females numbered 199,314 or 46.61 per cent of the total Hindu population; Musalm\u00e1n males numbered 10,287 or 53.10 per cent, and Musalm\u00e1n females 9085 or 46.90 per cent of the total Musalm\u00e1n population; and Christian males numbered 14 or 60.87 per cent, and Christian females 9 or 39.13 per cent of the total Christian population.\n\nThe following are the chief caste and race details.\\(^2\\) Among Hindus, Br\u00e1hmans numbered 22,974 (males 11,311, females 11,663) or 6.44 per cent of the total Hindu population. Some are employed in Government service, some act as petty money-lenders, some are cultivators, and a few enjoy grants of land, but the majority live on charity and serve as priests and cooks. As a body they are well off. Of degraded Br\u00e1hmans there are two classes, Tapodhans and Vy\u00e1sd\u00e1s. A few Tapodhans work as messengers or husbandmen, but most live on alms; the Vy\u00e1sd\u00e1s are cultivators and are poor.\n\nK\u00e1yasths are the only writers. Few in number and well-to-do, they enjoy villages granted to their forefathers for services done to the different chiefs.\n\nOf Traders, V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s have a total strength of 21,918 souls (males 11,271, females 10,647) or 6.15 per cent of the whole Hindu population. V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s follow different branches of trade, and are in middling circumstances, their business being local not connected with other parts of Gujar\u00e1t.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The details are: Br\u00e1hmans, 18,890; V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, 19,214; Kanbis, 49,890; Kolis, 104,931; Rajputs, 14,636; Sonis, 1239; Suth\u00e1rs, 4386; Luh\u00e1rs, 4417; Darj\u00eds, 3483; Kumbh\u00e1rs, 6215; Bhats and Ch\u00e1rans, 3441; Kal\u00e1l\u00eds, 2020; and 65,968 unclassified. Of the 12,296 Musalmans 1794 were Bohoras. Bom. Gov. Sel. XII. 94.\n\n\\(^2\\) Several classes have been brought under the head \"Miscellaneous\". For these details are not available.\nOf Cultivators there were three chief classes, with a total strength of 254,516 souls (males 137,323, females 117,193), or 71.38 per cent of the whole Hindu population. Of these 68,667 (males 35,851, females 32,816) were Kanbis, 167,972 (males 91,976, females 75,996) Kolis, and 17,877 (males 9496, females 8381) Rajputs. Besides these are three minor classes of flower and market gardeners, Sahtv\u00e1ras, S\u00e1gors, and M\u00e1lis, all of them poor. Kanbis, though not rich, are generally well off. Amongst them is a tribe known as \u00c1njna Kanbis of part Rajput descent. Like Rajputs, they eat meat and use intoxicating liquors. Those who do not themselves work in the fields affect Rajput dress and manners, and do not let their women appear in public. Another class is known as D\u00e1ngi or Hill Kanbis. Originally \u00c1njn\u00e1s, with whom they dine but do not intermarry, they are said to have lost their position by adopting the dress and language of Bhils. Many of them live in Meyw\u00e1r and have marriage and other relations with the Mahi K\u00e1ntha D\u00e1ngis.\n\nRajputs are found in the service of the chiefs, some as personal attendants, others tilling service lands. Though not rich, they are well-to-do. In 1821 Mr. Elphinstone described\u00b9 the Mahi K\u00e1ntha Rajputs as forming two classes, the M\u00e1rv\u00e1dis who accompanied the R\u00e1ja of Idar (about 1700) in his emigration from Jodhpur, and the Gujar\u00e1tis who had long been settled in the province, chiefly in the central parts. The M\u00e1rv\u00e1dis resembled the people of Jodhpur in their dress and manners, but with additional rudeness contracted in their sequestered situation. They were said to be very brave, but stupid, slothful, unprincipled, and devoted to the use of opium and intoxicating liquor. Those of Gujar\u00e1t were more like the inhabitants of that province, more civilized than the M\u00e1rv\u00e1dis, honester, more submissive, and more inactive and unwarlike. All the Rajputs used swords and spears, matchlocks and shields. They often wore defensive armour of leather both on themselves and on their horses, and sometimes but rarely carried bows. Their plan of war was to defend their villages. They seldom took to the woods like the Kolis, and were quite unfit for the desultory warfare so suited to Koli habits. The Kolis are poor, living as landholders, field labourers and village watchmen. Their chiefs are, with few exceptions, descendants of Rajput and Koli women. They still keep the names of their forefathers\u2019 tribes, as R\u00e1thod, Choh\u00e1n, Makv\u00e1na. In 1821 Mr. Elphinstone described the Kolis or Bhils, for they were called indiscriminately by both names, as by much the most numerous and most important of the Mahi K\u00e1ntha tribes. Though there was no very marked difference in feature between them and the other inhabitants, they were generally easily known. They were smaller and had an expression of liveliness and cunning in their eyes. They wore small turbans and few clothes, and were seldom seen without a quiver of arrows and a long bamboo bow, instantly bent on any alarm or on the sudden approach of a stranger. They might seem weaker and less active than their neighbours, but this was not actually the case. The natives described them as wonderfully swift, active and\n\n\u00b9 Minute, 28th February 1821.\nhardy, incredibly patient of hunger, thirst, fatigue, and want of sleep, vigilant, enterprising, secret, fertile in expedients, and admirably calculated for night attacks, surprises, and ambuscades. These qualities were probably exaggerated, but they certainly were active, hardy, and as remarkable for sagacity as for secrecy and celerity in their predatory operations. Their arms and habits rendered them unfit to stand in the field, and they must be admitted to be timid when attacked; but they had on several occasions shewn extraordinary boldness in assaults even on English stations. They were of an independent spirit, and although all were professed robbers, they were said to be remarkably faithful when trusted, and they were certainly never sanguinary. They were averse to regular industry, exceedingly addicted to drunkenness and very quarrelsome when intoxicated. Their delight was plunder, and nothing was so welcome to them as a general disturbance. Though the Kolis had a strong fellow-feeling for each other, they never thought of themselves as a nation and never made common cause against a foreign enemy. A peculiar tribe settled in the V\u00e2trak K\u00e2nth\u00e2 keeps the Rajput patronymic of Makv\u00e2na. They are Koli converts in name to Muhammadanism, but scarcely changed in religion, manners or character. Their men marry into the Koli tribes of Kolval, Raj\u00e2vat and B\u00e2riya, and give their daughters to the B\u00e1bi Musalm\u00e1ns. The chiefs of Khad\u00e1l, Ram\u00e1s D\u00e1bha and Pun\u00e1dra belong to the clan.\n\nOf Manufacturers there were two classes, Chhipa Bh\u00e1vs\u00e1rs, calico-printers, numbering 2207 souls (males 1111, females 1096), and Gh\u00e1nchis, oil pressers. The Chhipa Bh\u00e1vs\u00e1rs stamp coarse native cloth in different colours and are well-to-do. The Gh\u00e1nchis are poor.\n\nOf Artisans there were ten classes: 1536 (males 799, females 737), Sonis, gold and silver smiths; 675 (males 356, females 319) Kadi\u00e1s, bricklayers; 6101 (males 3169, females 2932) Suth\u00e1rs, carpenters; 6093 (males 3204, females 2889) Luh\u00e1rs, blacksmiths; 4756 (males 2436, females 2320) Darj\u00eds, tailors; 9158 (males 4884, females 4324) Kumbh\u00e1rs, potters; Kans\u00e1rs, coppersmiths; Sal\u00e1ts, masons; Khar\u00e1dis, turners; and Sar\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, sword and knife sharpeners. Except Darj\u00eds, Khar\u00e1dis, Kumbh\u00e1rs, and Sar\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, who are rather poor, artisans are on the whole well off. Besides carpentering, Suth\u00e1rs till lands held for village service. Stone masons, Sal\u00e1ts, are settled chiefly at and near Ahmednagar.\n\nOf Bards and Actors there were three classes, Bh\u00e1ts, bards; Ch\u00e1rans, genealogists; and Targ\u00e1l\u00e1s, strolling players. The first two classes together numbered 4645 souls (males 2529, females 2116). A few of them enjoy grants of villages received in reward for services as court bards. Others till lands and are only at times called to recite before their masters the Rajput t\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs. As a class they are poor. A few of the Targ\u00e1l\u00e1s hold grants of villages, but they are generally poor.\n\nOf Personal Servants there were two classes, Haj\u00e1ms, barbers, and Khav\u00e1s, servants. The Khav\u00e1s, who are personal servants in the households of Rajput chiefs, are well-to-do with fixed allowances and\nservice lands. A few Haj\u00e1ms cultivate lands generally held for village service. As a class they are poor.\n\nOf Herdsmen and Shepherds there were two classes with a strength of 11,797 (males 6399, females 5398) or 3\u00b731 per cent of the whole Hindu population. Of these 11,253 (males 6096, females 5157) were Rab\u00e1ris, and 544 (males 303, females 241) Bharv\u00e1ds, a lower class of shepherds. Both are poor and go by the name of R\u00e1ika.\n\nThe Bhois, originally fishers, except a few who work as palanquin-bearers and bricklayers, are generally husbandmen.\n\nUnder the head of Labourers and Miscellaneous Workers came thirteen classes. There were 2174 (males 1131, females 1043) Kal\u00e1ls, liquor sellers; 1557 (males 940, females 617) Vanj\u00e1r\u00e1s, gram carriers; 213 (males 111, females 102) Thoris, bamboo basket makers; 6507 (males 3577, females 2930) R\u00e1vali\u00e1s, drum beaters; 1627 (males 850, females 777) V\u00e1ghris, fowlers and hunters; Bh\u00e1ndnag\u00e1rchis, kettle-drum beaters in constant attendance on the chiefs; Dhankut\u00e1s, corn-pounders; Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, chiefly employed as horsemen in the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r's contingent; B\u00e1vch\u00e1s, labourers; Baj\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, acrobats; Ods, diggers; V\u00e1dis, jugglers; and Dh\u00e1dmirs, low class actors. Except the Kal\u00e1ls, Vanj\u00e1r\u00e1s, and Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, these classes are very poor.\n\nUnder the head Unsettled Tribes came the Gir\u00e1sia Bhils, of the north and north-east frontiers. They support themselves partly by agriculture and partly by robbery and cattle lifting. They also serve as watchmen and guides. The Mahi K\u00e1ntha Bhils speak a language in sound something between Hindi and Gujar\u00e1ti and very hard to understand. They eat almost all kinds of flesh, including that of the cow. They worship stones covered with red-lead and oil, and are firm believers in witchcraft and much given to the practice of witch swinging. During the last ten years on the north-east frontier some Bhils taking the name of bhagats have become the followers of a Bhil teacher Kher\u00e1di Surmal, a native of the village of Lusdia Tabe Kuski in the Idar state, about four miles from S\u00e1ml\u00e1ji. This teacher believes in the Hindu god R\u00e1m, and forbids the killing of animals, the drinking of liquor, and the committing of offences. Like a high caste Hindu the bhagat takes no meal without bathing, puts a red mark on the brow and ties a yellow strip of cloth round the turban. In 1871, during the S\u00e1ml\u00e1ji fair, Kher\u00e1di was visited by the Assistant Political Agent. He was living by himself and had, including the members of his family, about 400 followers. On account of their change of customs the Meyw\u00e1r and other Mahi K\u00e1ntha Bhils treated these bhagats as outcastes and caused them much annoyance. This the authorities put a stop to. Since then two of Kher\u00e1di's disciples have settled at Pahada and Oad in the Idar state, and have almost doubled the strength of the sect. The bhagats live by tillage and are better off than they were before. During the last ten years not one of their number has been accused of any crime.\n\nAmong the Mahi K\u00e1ntha Bhils under ordinary circumstances the woman chooses her husband. But at the Posina fair in the north,\nif a Bhil, without being seen, succeeds in taking the woman he wants to marry across the river, the parents of both agree to the marriage. If he is found out before he has reached the other side the man is severely punished by the girl's father. Each Bhil hamlet has its headman, gameti, whose office is as a rule hereditary. They have an elaborate system of taking vengeance, ver, usually by carrying off cattle. They go about armed with bows and arrows, and on the slightest provocation wound and kill each other. Though always quarrelling among themselves, they are quick to join against an outside enemy. None of them, whatever he may be doing, disregards the long shrill cry, kilki, that shows a Bhil is in trouble. And, while they stoutly resist any interference on his part, when their chief's drum beats they gather at a moment's notice to fight for him. Of late years their state has greatly improved and they have grown much more manageable.\n\nOf Leather Workers there were two chief classes with a total strength of 15,499 souls (males 8292, females 7207). Of these 1442 (males 769, females 673) were Mochis, shoemakers; and 14,057 (males 7523, females 6534) Bhambhis, tanners, one of the depressed classes. Besides these there is a small body of Dabgars, makers of leather butter jars and scales.\n\nBesides the Bhambhis, there were three other depressed castes, all of them poor; Dheds, weavers, numbering 18,578 souls (males 10,052, females 8526); Bhangias, sweepers, 7346 (males 3841, females 3505); and Garudas or Dhed priests.\n\nUnder the head of Beggars came Atits, Nanaksais, Bhartharis, and Fatahs, eunuchs. A few of the Atits hold village grants and some have banking shops, but most live on alms. The Bhartharis are a wandering tribe who live by singing love-songs and begging.\n\nOf 19,372 Musalmans, besides the four regular divisions, Syeds, Shaikhs, Pathans, and Moghals, there were Hindu converts of the Pinjara, Bohora, Molesalam, and other classes. Musalmans generally serve as messengers and horsemen, but some are traders, artisans, cultivators, and labourers. Most of them are in debt, chiefly owing to the large sums they spend on their marriage and other ceremonies.\n\nThe mass of the people are poor, with so little to fall back on that one bad season causes distress. In ordinary years the necessaries of life are cheap and plentiful, and if the ruinous expenditure now enforced by caste customs on their leading family observances were to fall into disuse their condition would rapidly improve.\n\nTo every square mile of land there are about four villages, with, on an average, 271 people and about sixty-seven houses. In 1872, of a total of 109,883, or on an average 29\u00b703 to the square mile, 20,871 houses were of the better and 89,012 of the poorer sort. There are no forts or positions of strength in the Mahi Kantha. The hills, though numerous and much covered with forest, can be easily turned; from their extent and connection with other ranges, they form admirable hiding places for outlaws and other disturbers of the peace, but they are not fit to resist the attack of regular troops. The forest in some\nparts, particularly at the foot of the hills, is very thick and cut by ravines, giving good cover and the means of escape into the hills. Some of the villages in the S\u0101bar and V\u0101trak K\u00e1nth\u00e1s are strongly situated on the banks of very deep ravines running inland from the rivers and very favourable for escape. The villages themselves are without any defence.\n\nExcept in the Bhil hamlets on the north and north-east, where there is only one officer the g\u00e1meti, or headman, every village has its council, the president, who is generally held responsible by the authorities, called head, mukhi, and the members, signers, matad\u00e1rs. There is also the accountant, tal\u00e1ti, generally with the charge of several villages. In the S\u0101bar K\u00e1ntha the headmen are Momn\u00e1s, and in the frontier villages they are Bhils. In other parts they are Kanbis or Koli Th\u00e1kard\u00e1s. Except on the north and north-east, where they are Bhils, the village police are Kolis.\n\nThough most of the people stay unmoved in their villages, many educated youths and some of the labouring classes leave their homes in search of employment. As a rule only men go, staying away from one to five years, and coming back on marriage or death occasions, or if they happen to fall seriously sick. So too labourers, if they find steady work at mills or factories, stay long away, while if less fortunate they come back every year for the rainy months to look after their land. Carpenters and bricklayers generally move from one part of the district to another looking for work. Except a few cultivators from Baroda, almost no one comes to settle in the Mahi K\u00e1ntha.\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Sel, XII, 19.\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nAGRICULTURE.\n\nThe soil is of two kinds, light and black. Near the hills, to the north and north-east, though poor and stony, if better tilled, it would yield rich crops. The south and west, including the districts of S\u00e1bar K\u00e1ntha, B\u00e1visi, V\u00e1trak K\u00e1ntha, and Rehvar K\u00e1ntha, are level, with soil varying from rich black to light sandy, and generally very fertile. In Rehvar and in the Sarasvati valley, there is a large watered area. In other parts, on account of the great depth of the water-bearing strata, tillage is almost entirely confined to early, kharif, or rainy season crops. The Katosan villages, about thirty six-miles west of S\u00e1dra, have plenty of water near the surface, but so salt that, for irrigation, it is almost worthless. The soil in part of the marsh between the M\u00e1jam and the Meshva is very rich, yielding, without watering, wheat, barley, rape seed, and rice. At the same time it is apt to become charged with salts or soda, us, and lose its fruitfulness, recovering its sweetness after a few years. As the Mahi K\u00e1ntha has not been surveyed the tillage area cannot be ascertained.\n\nExcept from the H\u00e9thmati canal, and to some extent from the Sarasvati river, irrigation is carried on chiefly from wells and ponds. The chief watered crops are wheat, barley, opium, sugarcane, and garden produce. The acreage cost of irrigation is, for wheat, from 14s. to \u00a31 1s. (Rs. 7 - 10\u00bd); for barley, \u00a31 6s. to \u00a31 8s. (Rs. 13 - 14); for opium, \u00a31 10s. to \u00a32 5s. (Rs. 15 - 22\u00bd); and for sugarcane, \u00a310 to \u00a315 (Rs. 100 - 150).\n\nWhere land is plentiful and the population sparse, fields are allowed to lie fallow every third year. In the more densely peopled villages, as the land cannot be left fallow, to prevent exhaustion, it is manured, and a rotation of crops is practised. Pulse, math, is grown after millet, b\u00e1jri, and oil-seed, tal, follows panic, kodra. Manure costs from 1s. to 1s. 6d. (8-12 annas) the cart-load of about a quarter of a ton (15 mans) and twenty cart-loads are required for an acre.\n\nIn the Mahi K\u00e1ntha, a plough of land, that is the area that can be tilled by a plough drawn by one pair of oxen, varies from two to three acres in rocky and stony soil, and from eight to ten acres in soft easy soil. The tools wanted to till a plough of land are, the plough, hal; the clod-crusher, sam\u00e1r or r\u00e1mp; the sowing drill, v\u00e1vmia or ch\u00e1var; the weeder, karvari or r\u00e1mp; the leather bag and rope for drawing water, kos-vrat; the hoe, kod\u00e1li; the axe,\nChapter IV. Agriculture.\n\nkoh\u00e1di; the spade, p\u00e1vdo; and the sickle, d\u00e1tardu. A set of tools costs about \u00a33 10s. (Rs. 35), and a pair of oxen from \u00a32 to \u00a310 (Rs. 20 - 100). A cart, if the husbandman has one, is worth about \u00a310 (Rs. 100).\n\nHoldings.\n\nHoldings vary in size from six to sixty acres. Forty to fifty is a large, twenty to thirty a medium, and six to ten acres, a small holding. A husbandman with a holding of five acres is not so well off as a retail shopkeeper, nor as a man with a monthly income of 16s. (Rs. 8).\n\nStock.\n\nDuring the eighteen years ending 1872 oxen increased from 91,414 to 185,149 or 102\u00b754 per cent; cows from 101,249 to 163,659 or 61\u00b764 per cent; and buffaloes from 67,894 to 157,567 or 132\u00b708 per cent.\n\nMahi K\u00e1ntha Stock, 1854 and 1872.\n\n| Year | Ploughs | Oxen | Cows | Buffaloes | Horses | Sheep | Goats | Camels | Asses | Mules | Elephants | Total |\n|------|---------|------|------|-----------|--------|-------|-------|--------|-------|-------|-----------|-------|\n| 1854 | ...     | 43,551 | 91,414 | 101,249 | 67,894 | ...   | ...   | ...    | ...   | ...   | ...       | 260,557 |\n| 1872 | ...     | 185,149 | 163,659 | 157,567 | 4316   | 16,187 | 98,624 | 1467   | 7811  | 1     | 8         | 634,734 |\n\nCrops.\n\nThe style of tillage in the Mahi K\u00e1ntha differs little from that in other parts of Gujar\u00e1t. The crops grown are, of Cereals: rice, d\u00e1ngar, Oryza sativa; wheat, ghau, Triticum aestivum; maize, mak\u00e1i, Zea mays; barley, jav, Hordeum hexastichon; millet, b\u00e1jri, Penicillaria spicata; Indian millet, j\u00fav\u00e1r, Sorghum vulgare; k\u00e1ng, Panicum italicum; banti, Panicum spicatum; b\u00e1vto, Panicum frumentaceum; kodra, Paspalum scrobiculatum; and cheno, Panicum miliaceum.\n\nOf Pulses: adad, Phaseolus mungo; mag, Phaseolus radiatus; chana, Cicer arietinum; math, Phaseolus aconitifolius; chola, Vigna catianga; v\u00e1l, Dolichos lablab; kalthi, Dolicos uniflorus; tuver, Cajanus indicus; and gav\u00e1r, Cyamopsis psoraloides. Of Fibres: cotton, ru, Gossypium herbaceum; flax, bhindi, Hibiscus populneus; and Bombay hemp, san, Crotalaria juncea. Of miscellaneous crops: sugarcane, serdi, Saccharum officinarum; poppy, khaskhas, Papaver somniferum; gingelly seed, tal, Sesamum indicum; rapeseed, sarsav, Brassica napus; r\u00e1jagra, Amaranthus polygamus; methi, Trigonella foenumgraecum; coriander seed, dh\u00e1na, Coriandrum sativum; cumin seed, jiru, Cuminum cyminum; vari\u00e1li, Foeniculum pannorum; swa, Pimpinella anisum; and singoda, Trapa bispinosa. The staple grains are the millets, b\u00e1jri and j\u00fav\u00e1r, wheat, ghau, a coarse description of rice, and, in the hilly parts of the district, maize, mak\u00e1i, the chief food of the Bhils.\n\nOf Cereals, wheat, ghau, Triticum aestivum, barley, jav, Hordeum hexastichon, and cheno, Panicum miliaceum, sown in dry lands in October and November, and reaped in March and April, are cold weather or late, rabi, crops. The rest are early, kharif, or rainy season crops, sown in dry lands in June and July, and reaped in September and October. Rice, Oryza sativa, sown in nurseries and planted out,\nwants moist and marshy land. It is of seven kinds: *sutars\u00e1l*, *vari*, *kharsu*, *s\u00e1thi*, *p\u00e1njaria*, *sengda*, and *senjani*. Rice, when it is sown is termed *d\u00e1ngar*; after it is reaped and ready for cooking, it is called *chokha*. During the last twenty years no improvement has taken place in the quality of the rice or other staple crops grown. The tillage area of the district has spread considerably, but there are no means of ascertaining the exact increase. Wheat, *ghau*, *Triticum aestivum*, of two kinds, *v\u00e1jia* and *kitha*, grows freely, especially in the valleys in the north of the district. If watered it is of excellent quality. Millet, *b\u00e1jri*, *Penicillaria spicata*, the common food of the people, is grown in the plains and not in the hilly parts. It thrives best in sandy soils. Maize, *mak\u00fai*, *Zea mays*, is grown much in the uplands.\n\nOf Pulses, gram, *chana*, *Cicer arietinum*, a late, *rabi*, crop, is sown in dry land in September and October and reaped in March; the rest are early, *kharijf*, crops, sown in dry lands in June and July and reaped in October and November.\n\nCotton, *ru*, *Gossypium herbaceum*, is sown in dry land in July and August and reaped in January and February. The other two, flax and Bombay hemp, are early, *kharijf*, crops, sown in June and reaped in October. During 1875-76 the area of land under cotton was about 3900 acres; the output is roughly estimated at about 150 tons (420 *kh\u00e1ndas*), most of it of middling quality and of a total estimated value of about \u00a35500 (Rs. 55,000).\n\nSugarcane, *serdi*, *Saccharum officinarum*, is sown in March and April and reaped after twelve months. Before growing sugarcane, a field is allowed to lie fallow for one year. Gingelly oilseed, *tal*, *Sesamum indicum*, is sown in July and reaped in November. *Swana*, sown in July and ready in December, is grown only in pond-beds. The rest of the miscellaneous crops are sown in September and October and reaped in March and April.\n\nKanbis, Kolis, and Musalm\u00e1ns, are the chief husbandmen, but almost all classes cultivate to some extent. The condition of the cultivating classes has of late years greatly improved. As a class they would be very well-to-do but for their extravagance on their weddings and other family ceremonies. Then many have to borrow, and, once deep in the money-lender\u2019s books, they are seldom able to free themselves.\n\nExcept by tradition little or nothing is known of past famines. Those best remembered are the great famines of 1791 and 1813, and the scarcities of 1825 and 1834. Of these, the usual tales are told, of great distress, of numbers perishing for want of food, and of children exchanged for grain or abandoned. Railway communication is now near enough to prevent grain rising to famine prices in any but times of extreme distress.\n\nBesides drought the chief evils to which crops are subject are mildew, *geru*, insects, and locusts. These evils are rare, and when they do come are seldom so widespread as to affect the general harvest. There is no known cure for blight. In fields under irrigation, white ants are destroyed by putting tobacco into the...\ntrough through which the water flows. The castor-oil plant is also sown with other crops, as it is believed to be fatal to those most destructive insects.\n\nThough serious loss is sometimes caused by heavy rain, the Mahi K\u00e1ntha is not liable to floods. Of late years, in 1868 and again in September 1875, on account of heavy rain in Meyw\u00e1r, the S\u00e1barmati, the Sarasvati, and the H\u00e1thmati, rose above their greatest known height, and at several places on their banks did much damage, carrying away portions of villages and covering good arable ground with a thick bed of barren sand.\nCHAPTER V.\n\nCAPITAL.\n\nBrahmans, Vaniyas, Bohoras and craftsmen in towns and large villages, and Vaniyas and Bohoras in the rural parts of the district are able to save. Craftsmen as a rule spend almost all their savings on their great family ceremonies, but the Brahmins, Vaniyas, and Bohoras, after meeting all charges are still able to add to their capital. The few rich cultivators generally increase their earnings by lending money. Brahmins invest their savings in ornaments, in house building, in money lending, in trade, and in buying land and houses. Vaniyas and Bohoras dispose of their savings in buying ornaments, in house building, and in trade, and Vaniyas and Brahmins to a small extent, in making advances to cultivators.\n\nWhen a cultivator owes money to several creditors, he who advanced money for seed is held to have the first claim on the debtor's crops. Debtors are seldom imprisoned for the non-payment of their debts. None of the Mahi Kantha courts ever order the sale of land in liquidation of debt, and among cultivators land sales are only occasionally made. When a money-lender makes an advance he generally insists on receiving in mortgage some of the debtor's property, such as his cattle or house. When land is mortgaged it generally remains with the mortgager who makes over to the mortgagee a portion of the produce. The practice of mortgaging land has not of late years increased. Civil courts are little used for enforcing the payment of debts, and their decrees never go further than selling the debtor's house and movable property. Between a cultivator and a money-lender the usual agreement is that the money-lender is the first to be paid out of the crop. In villages inhabited by the poorer classes, such as Kolis and Bhils, tillage generally depends on the money-lender's capital. These cultivators admit the money-lender's usefulness, but complain of the hardness of his terms. Neither cultivators nor artisans have intelligence enough to prevent the money-lender from bringing false claims and extorting oppressive rates of interest. The indebtedness of poor Bhil and Koli cultivators in many cases leads to crime.\n\nSometimes a labourer raises money by mortgaging his labour for four or five years. The bondsman's services are valued at from \u00a32 8s. to \u00a36 (Rs. 24-60) a year. And for an advance of \u00a310 (Rs. 100) many men would be willing to serve for any time up to five years. In cases where the labourer engages to supply loads\nof grass or firewood, he is allowed to work at odd times for his own benefit, but if a man has mortgaged his labour without reservation, the whole of his earnings are his master's. In no case does the money-lender's claim extend to the labour of the bondsman's wife or child. Men in the position of these labourers are fed and housed by their masters. But the master does not meet the cost of a birth or other ceremony in the bondsman's family. The master cannot make over his right to any other person, and cannot by corporal punishment or other means enforce the bondman's services.\n\nThe old system of hereditary service is still kept up in the houses of some Rajput and Koli chiefs. The servants called boys, Chhokra, and girls, Chholri, are with their families bred and maintained in their master's house at his expense. They are generally faithful to their masters. No instance is known of one of these servants being tempted by the chance of good wages to leave his master. As far as food, clothes, and lodging go they are better off than other families of the same class.\n\nThe yearly rate of interest varies from four and a half to fifty per cent. In small transactions where an article is given in pawn, it varies from four and a half to nine per cent; in large transactions with a mortgage on movable property it is six per cent; in transactions with a mortgage on houses or lands from six to nine per cent; in petty agricultural advances upon personal security from twelve to eighteen per cent; and in advances of grain with a lien on the crops from twenty-five to fifty per cent. Six per cent a year would be considered a fair return for money invested in buying an estate. Interest is charged by the month, according to the Hindu year, and in years with an intercalary month, it is charged for thirteen months instead of for twelve.\n\nIn most parts of the district the Imperial rupee is the standard in common dealings. In some places Baroda babashai and sicca rupees are also in use. In transactions carried on in Government rupees, discount is allowed according to current rates.\n\nIn 1850 Kolis and other field labourers were paid 3d. (2 annas) a day; smiths, bricklayers, masons, and carpenters 7\u00bdd. (5 annas), and tailors 6d. (4 annas). In 1870-71 the daily wages of Kolis and other field labourers rose to 4\u00bdd. (3 annas), and that of smiths, bricklayers, masons, and carpenters to 1s. (8 annas). These rates still continue. Day labourers are generally Kolis, who offer their services either as partners or as field workers. As partners they usually receive a third or a fourth of the crop, and as workers, if engaged for the whole year, a total payment of about 240 pounds (six mans) of grain, and if engaged only for a time 2\u00bdd. (1\u00bd annas) worth of grain, besides food for the day. Women and children are employed as day-labourers; the woman in most cases getting as much as a man, the children 1\u00bdd. (1 anna) worth of grain besides food for the day. Payments for field work are in grain not in cash. For other than field work the daily wage of a labourer is for a man 3d. to 4\u00bdd. (2 - 3 annas); for a woman 2\u00bdd. to 3\u00bdd. (1\u00bd - 2\u00bd annas) and for a child 1\u00bdd. to 2\u00bdd. (1 - 1\u00bd annas).\nThe following table gives the rupee prices of the different staple products in 1850, 1860, 1870, and 1878:\n\n| Produce          | 1850 | 1860 | 1870 | 1878 |\n|------------------|------|------|------|------|\n| Millet           | 100  | 40   | 35   | 21   |\n| Indian millet    | 90   | 70   | 36   | 20   |\n| Rice             | 38   | 24   | 19   | 15   |\n| Wheat            |      |      |      |      |\n| Pulse            |      |      |      |      |\n| Maize            |      |      |      |      |\n\nThere are no dealers in precious stones. The scale for gold and silver is: three *ratis*, one *v\u00e1l*; sixteen *v\u00e1ls*, one *gadi\u00e1n*; two *gadi\u00e1nas*, one *tola*. The weight *rati* is the seed of the Abrus precatorius, and the other weights are square pieces of lead and brass. Coffee, cotton, drugs, salt, spices, molasses, sugar, rice, and grains are weighed according to the following measure: four *p\u00e1s\u00e9r*, one *ser*; forty *sers*, one *man*. A *ser* is equal in weight to forty Imperial rupees. The *p\u00e1s\u00e9r* is of iron round and flat in form. Small weight measures to equal $\\frac{1}{15}$ and $\\frac{1}{8}$ of a *ser* and two *sers*, four *sers*, five *sers*, ten *sers*, and twenty *sers* are also in use and are made of iron. The measures for liquids such as clarified butter, oil, and honey, are $2\\frac{1}{2}$ rupees, one *adh\u00f3l*; two *adh\u00f3ls*, one *navt\u00e1nk*; two *navt\u00e1nks*, one *p\u00e1s\u00e9r*; two *p\u00e1s\u00e9rs*, one *achh\u00e9r*; two *achh\u00e9rs*, one *ser*; ten *sers*, one *dh\u00e1di*; four *dh\u00e1dis*, one *man*; all of them round flat pieces of iron.\n\nIn the wild parts of the province, in measuring quantities of less than five *sers* of butter or honey, instead of weights, wooden measures are used. In some places milk is also sold by measure up to one *ser* in brass vessels. For liquor, glass bottles and small copper vessels are used as measures up to a *ser* and a half; in some places earthen pots are also used as measures up to half a *man*. The measure for other substances is four *p\u00e1s\u00e9r*, one *ser*; $1\\frac{1}{4}$ *sers*, one *p\u00e1li*; four *p\u00e1li*s, one *m\u00e1nu*; two *m\u00e1nu*s, one *dom\u00e1nu*; two *dom\u00e1nu*s, one *s\u00e1hi*; five *s\u00e1hi*s, one *p\u00e1k\u00e1l*; four *p\u00e1k\u00e1l*s, one *k\u00e1l*; ten *k\u00e1l*s, one *muda*. The *p\u00e1s\u00e9r*, made of iron or stone is round and flat in form; the *p\u00e1li* and *m\u00e1nu* are cylinder-shaped wooden measures; the *s\u00e1hi*, *p\u00e1k\u00e1l*, *k\u00e1l* and *muda*, are simply names. No weights or measures of their size are in use. Cotton, silk, and other goods are sold by the following measure, but when entire pieces of cloth are sold in lump, a score is the unit in ordinary use; two *\u00e1ngals* or finger breadths one *tasu*, the space between finger joints; twenty-four *tasus*, one *gaj*; thirty-six *tasus*, one *v\u00e1r* or yard; and eighteen *tasus*, one *h\u00e1th* or cubit. The other long measures are eight *yaws*, one *\u00e1ngal*; two *\u00e1ngals*, one *tasu*; twelve *tasus*, one *h\u00e1th*; three *h\u00e1ths*, one *p\u00e1nadu* or *k\u00e1dam*; and 1800 *p\u00e1nadus* or *k\u00e1dam*s, one *g\u00e1u*, about one and a half miles. Land is measured according to the following table: eighteen *tasus*, one *h\u00e1th*; five *h\u00e1ths*, one *k\u00e1thi*; twenty *k\u00e1th\u00eds*, one *vasa*; twenty *vas\u00e1s*, one *vigha*. The time measures are sixty *pals*, one *gh\u00e1di* of twenty-four minutes; two *gh\u00e1dis*, one *muhurt*; two and a half *gh\u00e1dis*, one *kal\u00e1k* or hour; three *kal\u00e1k*s, one *priahar*; eight *priahars*, one *divas* or *tithi*, day; fifteen *tith\u00eds*, one *paksh* or fortnight; two *pakshas*, one *m\u00e1s* or month; two *m\u00e1s*, one *ritu*; and six *ritus*, one *varsh* or year. Masonry\nis sold by solid measure as follows: rough hewn stones, 2 to 2\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) gaj in length, \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) gaj in breadth, and four tasus in depth for 2s. (Re. 1); wrought stone, twelve tasus long, twelve tasus broad, and twelve tasus deep, that is nearly one cubic foot, is sold at from 1s. 9d. to 2s. 3d. (14 annas - Re. 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)) per cubic foot. Grinding stones are sold at the rate of 2s. to 5s. (Re. 1 - 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)) per cubic foot. There are no local measures either for timber or earth.\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nTRADE.\n\nThere are nine chief lines of road. A made road nearly all the way from Idar to Ahmednagar, partly bridged, about ten miles; a made road from Idar to Brahmakhed, unbridged, fifteen miles; a made road from Idar to Dhambolia, unbridged, twenty-four miles, but raised only to Badoli, three miles; a tram-road from the gate of the town of Ahmednagar to the H\u00e1thmati weir, \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of a mile; a cleared roadway from the railway station at Ahmedabad to S\u00e1dra cantonment, passing through British, Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r, and Mahi K\u00e1ntha territory; a cleared roadway from Ahmedabad to Meyw\u00e1r and V\u00e1gad, passing through British, Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r, and Mahi K\u00e1ntha territory; a cleared roadway from Ahmedabad to Neemuch via Meghraj, passing through British, Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r, and Mahi K\u00e1ntha territory; an ordinary road from Brahmakhed into M\u00e1rw\u00e1r by Posina, passing through Idar and D\u00e1nta limits; an ordinary road from Val\u00e1sna to P\u00e1l, leading on to Kherv\u00e1da in the Meyw\u00e1r hilly tracts. All of these roads have been built and made fit for traffic by the chiefs through whose territories they pass. A poor kind of gravel, muram, found on the spot is used for the surface of the made roads. An attempt is now being made to break into metal the rocks near the Ahmednagar and Idar road. These roads are free from tolls, but at different posts, n\u00e1k\u00e1s, transit dues are levied.\n\nThere are at present (1877-78) five post offices at Idar, Ahmednagar, S\u00e1dra, M\u00e1nsa, and Peth\u00e1pur. Letters are delivered at these five stations by delivery peons, and to help in distributing letters, rural messengers are attached to the post offices at M\u00e1nsa, Ahmednagar, Idar, and S\u00e1dra. To places out of the range of the postal department, letters are conveyed by the horsemen of His Highness the Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r\u2019s Contingent.\n\nConsiderable traffic was formerly carried on between Gujar\u00e1t and Meyw\u00e1r through Idar, Pol, and thence to M\u00e1rw\u00e1r. The principal articles of trade in the Mahi K\u00e1ntha are grain of all sorts, tal, Sesamum indicum, clarified butter, ghi, oils, honey, wax, soap made from us an alkaline efflorescence found on the banks of rivers and other places, timber, and cloth both coloured and plain. The local manufactures, exported to the neighbouring districts of Ahmedabad and Baroda, are leather worked up in various ways, coloured cloth, knives, honey, wax, and soap.\n\nIn ordinary seasons more grain is produced than is wanted for the district food supply. Of the crops wheat, ghau, Triticum aestivum;\n\n---\n\n1 It is proposed to continue this stone tramway from Ahmednagar to the Parantij border.\nmaize, *mak\u00e1i*, *Zea mays*; millet, *b\u00e1jri*, *Penicillaria spicata*; Indian millet, *juv\u00e1r*, *Sorghum vulgare*; *methi*, *Trigonella foenumgraecum*; *math*, *Phaseolus aconitifolius*; and *adad*, *Phaseolus mungo*, are exported to some extent. The chief imported articles are Morinda, *surangi*, Morinda citrifolia; Safflower, *kasumba*, Carthamus tinctorius; turmeric, *haladh*, Curcuma longa; betel-nut, spices, English piece goods, silks, cloth for female dresses, and turbans from Prat\u00e1bgad in M\u00e1lwa, Ahmedabad, and Paithan in the Niz\u00e1m's dominions, tobacco, cocoanuts, dates, and copper and brass vessels.\n\nThe chief manufactures are of cloth *dangaris*, *dhoti\u00e1s*, *pachhedis*, printed *s\u00e1ll\u00e1s* and stamped quilts, *khola*; soap, molasses, oil, liquor, baskets, matting, pottery, charcoal, sealing wax, ornaments, wooden toys, and leather shoes, belts, and bags. Idar, Ahmednagar, and Peth\u00e1pur are famous for their arms and cutlery. In the Katosan district and at Idar the manufacture of opium was carried on, but is now forbidden. At Katosan during the year 1875-76 sixty-five chests and at Idar 145 chests together yielded the Idar state a revenue of \u00a3312 (Rs. 8120). In 1877-78 at Idar fifty-nine chests yielded \u00a3336 (Rs. 3360), and at Katosan eleven chests yielded \u00a352 (Rs. 517). Coarse cotton, *doti*, cloth is woven all over the district by Dheds. The Idar manufacture of red powder, *kanku*, has died out. In some parts R\u00e1vk\u00e1s and Bharv\u00e1ds for their own use get blankets made by R\u00e1vali\u00e1s, and pack-saddles, *dalis*, are also made, but wool-weaving is not an industry of any importance. At Idar, S\u00e1dra and M\u00e1nsa, Mani\u00e1rs, both Hindus and Musalm\u00e1ns, make ivory bracelets. The process is the same as at Ahmedabad. All well-to-do Hindu women including Rajputs and Kanbis use them in the same way as in Ahmedabad. At V\u00e1d\u00e1li, Brahmakhed, Meghraj, and Mohanpur, Dabgars make jars for holding clarified butter; the process of making them is the same as at Ahmedabad. They also make small oil jars, *badhlis* and *kundis*, and scales. Moch\u00eds, generally Hindus, make for local consumption shoes, country saddles, knife cases, and small boxes, *khisis*.\n\nThe following table shows where and when the Mahi K\u00e1ntha fairs are held, their average number of visitors, and the number of days each lasts.\n\n**Mahi K\u00e1ntha Fairs, 1879.**\n\n| No. | Place          | Date       | Visitors | Days |\n|-----|----------------|------------|----------|------|\n| 1   | R\u00e9ml\u00e1ji        | November   | 40,000   | Fifteen |\n| 2   | Brahmakhed    | February   | 6000     | Fifteen |\n| 3   | Amba Dhav\u00e1n\u00ed  | September  | 5000     | Five  |\n| 4   | Do.            | November   | 4600     | One   |\n| 5   | B\u00e1lcha         | September  | 5000     | One   |\n| 6   | Ahmednagar     | April      | 5000     | One   |\n| 7   | Idar           | September  | 5000     | One   |\n| 8   | Barv\u00e1y         | September  | 4000     | One   |\n| 9   | Delv\u00e1ran       | April      | 4000     | One   |\n| 10  | T\u00e9rrang\u00e1j\u00ed     | March      | 2000     | One   |\n| 11  | Esvi           | March      | 2000     | One   |\n| 12  | Bh\u00e1r\u00e1ch        | August     | 2000     | One   |\n| 13  | Hera\u00fal         | April      | 2000     | One   |\n| 14  | Mokesar        | August or  |         | One   |\n|     |                | September  |         |       |\n| 15  | Jasmim\u00e1ta      | August or  |         | One   |\n|     |                | September  |         |       |\n| 16  | Peth\u00e1pur (D\u00e1nt\u00fa) |        |         | One   |\n| 17  | Kotesar Mah\u00e1dev | March     | 1000     | One   |\n\nThe manufactures are chiefly carried on by the people on their\n\n---\n\n1 Sixteen chests go to the ton.\nown account and in their own houses; hired labour is seldom used. There is no class of labourers attached to any manufacture in a manner which affects their personal freedom. There are no cotton factories or other industries conducted by European agency or with European capital.\n\nThe chief craftsmen are carpenters, blacksmiths, weavers, dyers, and turners. There are no good carpenters, but the blacksmiths of Peth\u00e1pur, Ahmednagar, and Idar are skilled and clever workmen. Of weavers, Dheds all over the district make coarse cotton cloth, dangari. At Ahmednagar in Idar is a colony of Shia Bohor\u00e1s, weavers of coarse dhotis and other articles of dress. At Peth\u00e1pur, the finest weaving in the district is the work of Musalm\u00e1ns of the Momua sect. They say that about 100 years ago, annoyed and hindered by the Mar\u00e1tha government, fifty or sixty families of them left Ahmedabad, and under the guidance of one Bah\u00e1dar Karim came and settled at Peth\u00e1pur. Only five families who weave women's robes are now left. The cloth made by these Momu\u00e1s is woven from silk and cotton yarn, both country and English. The best dyers in the province are at Peth\u00e1pur, Hindus of the Bh\u00e1vs\u00e1r caste, who colour and send to Si\u00e1m coarse English cloth. The best wood-turners are at Idar. They turn and colour in a finished style tent poles and cot and cradle legs.\n\nIn the Mahi K\u00e1ntha all classes of traders, V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s dealing in money, cloth, grain or groceries, oilmen, dyers, calico-printers, Bohor\u00e1s and Dheds have each a trade guild, mah\u00e1jan, composed of the chief men of the community. To these guilds, marriage and other caste questions are referred for settlement. The V\u00e1nia mah\u00e1jan takes a lead in deciding disputes. The different sub-classes of manufacturers and craftsmen, such as among weavers, warpers and sorters, have not each a separate guild. If their interests clash, the question is referred for settlement to the V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s' guild. There has never been a strike in any of the trades. When all engaged in a craft or calling are of one caste, the mah\u00e1jan enforces its decisions by refusing to have any dealings with any disobedient member. When the men engaged in a craft or calling are of different castes no general steps are taken to enforce the mah\u00e1jan's decisions. Among money-lenders, cloth-sellers, grain-dealers, grocers, copper and brass sellers, the practice of apprenticeship prevails to a certain extent. The position of an apprentice is much the same as that of a clerk, gum\u00e1sta, or servant, and his yearly income varies from \u00a31 16s. to \u00a36 (Rs. 18 - 60). When a man adopts a craft or calling which his father did not follow, he has not to pay any entrance fine or make any special arrangements with the trade mah\u00e1jan, and no fees are levied when a man succeeds his father. Mah\u00e1jan funds are derived from gifts on occasions of marriage or death, from fines on breakers of caste rules, and from intestate property. They are spent on religious objects, and on matters touching the interests of the community. The leading men of the different V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1 castes are called Seths, but they have no special trade functions, and there is no nagarseth, or acknowledged head of the merchants.\n\nTrade is mostly carried on in permanent markets. The chief\nlocal trade-centres are M\u00e1nse, Peth\u00e9pur, S\u00e1dra, Idar, Ahmednagar, and Katosan. There are seventeen periodical fairs of which the S\u00e1ml\u00e1ji fair, on the north-east frontier of the Mahi K\u00e1ntha, held every year in November, and the Brahmakhed fair, fifteen miles north of Idar, held yearly in February, are the most important. Each of these lasts for fifteen days. At both, the staple articles of trade are brass, copper and ironware, cotton fabrics, brocade from Ahmedabad and embroidered work from Prat\u00e1bgad and Meyw\u00e1r, pearls, country ornaments, grain, opium, and cattle. The traffic at the other fairs is mainly in household necessaries. The average yearly value of the merchandise sold during the five years ending 1878 was \u00a363,226 (Rs. 6,32,260) at S\u00e1ml\u00e1ji, and \u00a37344 (Rs. 73,440) at Brahmakhed.\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nHISTORY.\n\nThe history of the lands included in the Mahi K\u00e1ntha Agency centres in the affairs of the Idar state. The traditions of that fortress reach back to mythical times, when, in the Dv\u00e1p\u00e1r Yug or third age, its rulers, Elvan the R\u00e1kshas and his brother V\u00e1t\u00e1pi, were destroyed by Agastya Rishi. The earliest settlers, both rulers and ruled, were the tribes now known as Bhils and Kolis. The next comers were Rajputs, whose arrival in the Mahi K\u00e1ntha seems to date from the establishment of Arab power in Sind and the fall of Valabhinagar in the eighth century. In the eleventh century the Musalm\u00e1n destruction of Nagar Tatta in Sind drove the Parm\u00e1r Rajputs, and in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the further advance of Musalm\u00e1n power, drove many other Rajput tribes, the Parm\u00e1rs of Chandr\u00e1vati, the R\u00e1thods of Kanouj, and the Ch\u00e1vd\u00e1s of Anhilv\u00e1da south into the Mahi K\u00e1ntha hills. To the Chandr\u00e1vati Parm\u00e1rs belong the houses of Mohanpur, Ran\u00e1san, Rup\u00e1l, Var\u00e1g\u00e1m, and Bolundra; to the Kanouj R\u00e1thods belong the houses of Pol, M\u00e1lpur, Val\u00e1sna, and Magodi; and to the Ch\u00e1vd\u00e1s of Anhilv\u00e1da, M\u00e1nsa and Varsoda. By intermarriage with the Kolis many of these Rajputs lost caste, only keeping the names of the Rajput clans, Makv\u00e1na, D\u00e1bi, and B\u00e1riya, to which their forefathers belonged. In the fifteenth century came the V\u00e1ghela houses of Peth\u00e1pur and Posina.\n\nAfter the supremacy of the Ahmedabad kings was established (1412), many Rajputs, the chiefs of Ghod\u00e1sar, Katosan, Ilol, Likhi, and G\u00e1b\u00e1t, in reward for service, and Pun\u00e1dra, Khad\u00e1l, D\u00e1bha, and Ram\u00e1s, offshoots of the house of M\u00e1ndva, because they agreed to embrace Isl\u00e1m, received grants of land. The decline of the Ahmedabad dynasty (1540-1570) favoured the increase of local power. Under the Moghals, for more than half a century, only every five or ten years, when specially well supplied with troops, did the Viceroy levy contributions in the Mahi K\u00e1ntha.\u00b9 Not till the latter half of the seventeenth century did the Moghals succeed in levying a regular tribute.\n\nIn the early years of the eighteenth century Moghal decay was accompanied by the revival of local independence. But, about the\n\n\u00b9 R\u00e1s M\u00e1l\u00e1, 340.\nmiddle of the century, this was again suppressed by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s who, settling in the province, levied tribute from all except the poorest and most out-of-the-way chiefs. Every two or three years, the Baroda Government collected tribute by means of a military force, but, losing strength in the beginning of the present century, they failed to control their Mahi K\u00e1ntha tributaries. As had been done in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r in 1807, it was, in 1811, arranged that the British Government should collect the tribute and pay it over to the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r, thus freeing the Baroda Government from the heavy burden of maintaining the revenue-collecting force, and freeing the province from the loss caused by its periodical progresses. The amount of tribute due was fixed on the basis of the past ten years levies, and security was taken for its regular payment and for the tributaries' good behaviour.\n\nAt the same time other claims, notably the Idar food, khichdi, demand, collected from their vassals by local chiefs, remained untouched; and the Koli chiefs, either as their original share, g\u00edr\u00e1\u015b, or as blackmail, vol, continued to collect small yearly levies from their quieter neighbours. Thus matters remained till, at the end of the 1818 campaign, the Peshwa's share of Gujar\u00e1t fell to the British. Their new possessions brought the British Government into immediate contact with the surrounding unsettled, mehv\u00e1\u015bi, tribes of the Mahi K\u00e1ntha, and the interlacing of possessions and the confusion of authority ended in such general lawlessness that it was evident that some one power must become responsible for the maintenance of order. As the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r Government was unable to take this position, the management of the Mahi K\u00e1ntha was, by an agreement concluded on the 3rd April 1820, made over to the British Government. Under the terms of this agreement, the British Government undertook to collect and pay the tribute free of all expense, the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r Government pledging itself not to send troops or in any way interfere with the districts. It was also agreed that expenses incurred in coercing a refractory chief should be recovered from his estate.\n\nTo preserve order and carry out the terms of this agreement, a British Political Agent was in 1821 placed in charge of the Mahi K\u00e1ntha. The three points that chiefly pressed for settlement were, to establish order, and secure future quiet; to collect tribute arrears and insure future regular payment; and to settle the Idar territory. For these objects a military force was placed at the Political\n\n---\n\n1 Of the sixty-three Mahi K\u00e1ntha states the only houses who pay no Baroda tribute are Pol, Magodi, G\u00e1b\u00e1t, Timba, V\u00e1r\u00e1g\u00e1m, R\u00e1n\u00edpura, Bolundr\u00e1, Likhi, and Umbri.\n\n2 Bom. Gov. Sel. XII. 6. For the text of the treaty see ditto pp. 282-285, and Aitchison's Treaties (1876), IV. 71. There the treaty of sixteen articles is said to be the one made by Colonel Ballantyne in 1812. But it seems that the original agreement was altered in 1814, in 1818, in 1821, and in 1822, and that it was in 1830 that the final agreement was concluded by Colonel Miles and his assistant, Lieutenant Prescott, Political Agent, 1057 of 30th September 1879.\n\n3 Bom. Gov. Sel. XII. 7. For the text of the treaty see Aitchison's Treaties (1876), IV, 235.\nAgent's disposal. The chiefs were called on to sign agreements, to abstain from plunder, to surrender plunderers and other offenders, to employ their whole means to put down marauders, to abstain from private war, to refer disputes to the arbitration of the British Government, and to protect traders. Owing perhaps as much to poverty as to unwillingness to pay, the chiefs had allowed their tribute to fall greatly into arrears, and the Baroda Government by pressing exorbitant claims added to the difficulty of a settlement. The matter was referred to the Bombay Government, who decided that the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r was not entitled to more than had been sanctioned by the settlement of 1811-12. Full and counter securities for future payments were taken, and an average fixed for the settlement of the various claims of the petty chiefs. In 1828, as a measure of economy, the Panch Mah\u00e1s, R\u00e1jpipla, and Mahi K\u00e1ntha Agencies were consolidated. To this charge Mr. Willoughby was appointed, but leaving shortly after, the Mahi K\u00e1ntha was attached to the Baroda Residency. In 1829 an officer was appointed to reside at S\u00e1dra to superintend the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r's contingent, and one of the assistants from the Baroda Residency was yearly deputed to collect the tribute.\n\nThis attempt to manage the country from a distance failed. In 1833, on the death of R\u00e1ja Gambhirsing of Idar, Fatehsing, chief of Rup\u00e1l, seizing a rich merchant, brother of the Idar minister, refused all ransom till a sum owing him by the Idar state was paid. This sum the minister could not pay, and other arrangements failing, the minister promised Surajmal, son of Jh\u00e1lamsing chief of Mondeti, a large reward if he succeeded in freeing his brother. Gathering about 400 mercenaries and joined by the V\u00e1vri Bhils then at feud with Rup\u00e1l, Surajmal hunted the chief from place to place, and at last took the fort of Rup\u00e1l. Applying to the Idar minister for funds to pay his mercenaries, Surajmal was refused, and, becoming desperate, plundered Bokh\u00e1r and two or three other Idar villages, and retired first to the forest of Ph\u00e1rki near Mondeti, and then to Vad\u00e1li levying contributions from the neighbouring villages. In 1835, on the death of R\u00e1ja Karansing of Ahmednagar, Mr. Erskine the British Agent, hearing that three of the late R\u00e1ja's wives were to be burnt, advanced with a body of troops and guarded all the gates of the town. Determining to perform the rite, the chief's family called in some Bhils, who secretly raising a funeral pile on the side of the town furthest from the British encampment, and, during the night, breaking a hole in the city wall, led out the three R\u00e1n\u00eds and kindled the pyre. Seeing the flames the British Agent pressed on with his small force, but was opposed by the Bhils and did not reach the burning ground till all was over. Afraid of vengeance the R\u00e1ja's two sons Prithising and Takhtsing fled to the hills. Next day Surajmal, who had been called in to help, arrived with a body of about sixty horse and one thousand Makr\u00e1n\u00eds, and, finding how matters had gone, retired. Mr. Erskine occupied the town and called in additional troops. Captain Delamain and Major Morris, with some difficulty and loss, succeeded in dispersing the armed bands and in destroying several strongholds, but failed to capture the outlaws or to restore order.\nMeanwhile (1835) affairs at Idar went from bad to worse. The cultivators, plundered alike by the chief and the numerous outlaws, deserted their villages, public confidence was destroyed, and the state threatened with speedy ruin. To restore order the Political Agency was re-established, and Captain, afterwards Sir James Outram, so vigorously hunted down the leading outlaws that opposition was quelled.\\(^1\\) On the 7th February 1836 a general amnesty was proclaimed; the outlaw chiefs were invited to attend; their lands were promised to them on submission; and a guarantee was given that their grievances should be inquired into and redressed. Prithising and his brother Takhtsing, the first to avail themselves of these conditions, were restored to their possessions on renouncing the practice of widow burning, and engaging not to entertain foreign mercenaries. They were followed by all the other outlaws, who, on tendering their submission, were treated with equal leniency. By the end of 1836 tranquillity was restored. Besides by suppressing disorder, Sir James Outram, by establishing the S\u00e1ml\u00e1ji fair and starting a system of Border Arbitrations, greatly benefited the Mahi K\u00e1ntha. About 1839 the widow of the Th\u00e1kor of \u00c1mliy\u00e1ra, failing to disprove the rights of the Th\u00e1kor\u2019s posthumous son by another wife, took to the hills, accompanied by her supporters the Th\u00e1kor of S\u00e1thumba and other chiefs, among them the lately pardoned chief of Rup\u00e1l. A force was sent against them, their troops were scattered, and shortly after the widow, her adopted son, and the Rup\u00e1l family were captured. Escaping at the time, the Rup\u00e1l chief was next year caught and given up by the V\u00e1nk\u00e1nir and Torda Th\u00e1kors, and ended his days in the Ahmedabad jail.\n\nTo stop the ruinous practice of self-outlawry, Government made it a penal offence liable to very severe punishment.\\(^2\\) From that time self-outlawry became rare and it has now disappeared. In 1857 troops had to be called out to put down a rising at Ch\u00e1ndap, and, in the next year, the presence of a military force was twice required. On the first occasion measures were taken for registering arms, and, when necessary, for disarming part of the population. These measures were very distasteful both to the chiefs and the people, and such was the attitude assumed within the Mahi K\u00e1ntha and in the neighbouring Baroda districts where similar measures were adopted, that it was considered expedient to send a strong force under Major Grimes through the country. Owing to the judicious action of the Political Agent, Major Whitelock, and the impression left by the display of British power, that without coercion, 588 villages were disarmed and in 310 the arms were registered. Though not against the people of the Mahi K\u00e1ntha, Major Grimes\u2019 force had to be brought into action. The inhabitants of Dabhora, a village in the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r sub-division of Kher\u00e1l\u00fa, refused to give up their arms, and, on the appearance of the force, left their village and took up a strong position in the T\u00e1ringa hill. As they refused to surrender and murdered a trooper of the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r\u2019s contingent, it was considered\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) R\u00e1s M\u00e1la, 528.\n\n\\(^2\\) Bom. Gov. Sel. XII. 11.\nadvisable to dislodge them. Accordingly, on the 31st May 1858, their position was successfully attacked by a detachment of the 2nd Grenadier Regiment N. I., supported by some of the Gujar\u00e1t Irregular Horse. The attack was made with great spirit, the insurgents being driven from peak to peak till they were finally dispersed with a loss of about eighty killed and wounded and ten prisoners, the loss on the British side being two rank and file of the grenadiers killed and a trooper wounded.\n\nDuring this disturbance the attitude of Surajmal, Th\u00e1kor of Mondeti, caused considerable anxiety. Formerly a prominent outlaw, he was included in the amnesty of 1836. Deeply sunk in debt, his estate was placed under attachment and a fixed allowance set apart for his support. A reduction of the allowance gave the Th\u00e1kor great offence, as he had been incurring other heavy debts and had kept in his pay a considerable number of Makr\u00e1nis. While the work of registering arms was going on, he kept comparatively quiet. Afterwards he interfered with the arrangements made for the management of his estates, and, accompanied by a band of Makr\u00e1ni mercenaries, took to the hills. Happening at such a time, this could not be overlooked. And, as every effort to induce him to come in quietly, failed, a force was despatched to the scene of disturbance. Before the arrival of this force hostilities began. Captain Black, the Assistant Political Agent, accompanied by a body of Gujar\u00e1t Irregular Horse was reconnoitring the town of Mondeti, when some Makr\u00e1nis showed fight and wounded the officer in command. Afterwards when the Ahmedabad force arrived, on the 22nd August 1858, the town of Mondeti was attacked and carried with a loss to the assailants of seven men wounded. Owing to defective arrangements, the Makr\u00e1nis and others composing the garrison were allowed to escape and join the outlaw Th\u00e1kor. After this, though there was no further conflict until at the end of the year the Th\u00e1kor came in, troops had to be kept in the field, and a long chain of posts maintained.\n\nNine years later (1867), Prat\u00e1psing, a Rajput in the service of the Th\u00e1kor of Posina, levying a body of Makr\u00e1nis, raised a disturbance and went into outlawry. At his instigation the great-grandmother of the Th\u00e1kor fled to Posina taking the young chief with her. Additional militia, siband\u00ed, had to be levied, and matters were, after a time, satisfactorily arranged without any great disturbance of the peace. Next year, a detachment of British troops had to be sent to Posina to guard the frontier against the inroads of the outlawed Th\u00e1kor of Batt\u00e1na in Sirohi, and the arrangements then made saved the district from trouble.\n\nSince 1868 the public peace has been unbroken.\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nLAND ADMINISTRATION.\n\nThe land is held by chiefs, Th\u00e1kors, and proprietors, T\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs, in estates varying from a share in one village to a large tract of country. T\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs generally consider their tenants liable to be turned out at their pleasure. Still in practice a tenant who pays his rent is seldom ousted, and when a family have for long tilled the same fields, they are generally held to have gained some proprietary interest in the land. Occupancy rights are sometimes, though rarely, bought and sold. Land is, but field tools are not, liable to attachment and sale for private debt.\n\nIn some of the more outlying parts, especially in the north and east of Idar and in D\u00e1nta, are large areas of arable waste. In the Idar districts the waste is offered to cultivators on favourable terms, but settlers are scared by the wildness of the country and of its Bhil inhabitants. Formerly the land revenue was farmed; but it is now collected from the cultivators. Bhil villages, with no fixed sites and widely scattered houses, have no village temple or shop, and, except a headman, g\u00e1meti, no village officers. In other villages the headman, mukhi, signers, mat\u00e1d\u00e1rs, and accountant, tal\u00e1ti, gather the revenue from the cultivators and pay it to the proprietor, t\u00e1lukd\u00e1r. In the B\u00e1visi villages, collections, except for village expenses, are made over to the banker, nish\u00e1d\u00e1r, who stands security for the regular payment of the tribute and remits the amount to the Political Agent. During the last few years, by the advice of the Political Agent, a police patel has been added to the establishment of most villages. The village staff are in some parts of Idar paid in cash, but they generally hold rent-free lands or enjoy certain fees and perquisites. Several of the B\u00e1visi villages paying tribute, gh\u00e1sd\u00e1ma, to the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r, have otherwise the full management of their revenues. There are two chief rent systems, the acre-rate, bighoti, and the crop-share, bh\u00e1gbatdi. In theory the proprietor has the right to raise the rates or crop share; but the amount of increase is limited by the capability of the land and by public opinion, and, in practice, changes are seldom made. Except in a few Idar villages where crop-rates prevail, the rent is taken in kind. The general practice is that at harvest time the proprietor, with the headman and accountant, goes to each field, and, after examining it, fixes on a certain amount as the whole produce. From this twenty, thirty-three, or fifty per cent, according to village custom, is taken, and the rest divided into two parts, one of them of from $\\frac{1}{8}$ to $\\frac{1}{2}$ belonging to\nthe landlord and the other to the tenant. In Idar where a cash acre-rate, *bighoti*, is in force, the ordinary acreage charge is for garden land, *b\u00e1gayat*, 12s. (Rs. 6); for black soil, *k\u00e1li*, 6s. (Rs. 3); and for light soil, *gor\u00e1du*, 3s. (Rs. 1\u00bd). In such villages instalments fall due in January, March, May, and June. In others, where survey rates are being introduced, instalment dates correspond with those in British districts. The cesses,\\(^1\\) *ver\u00e1s*, levied on V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s and other non-cultivating classes, fall due in February, *Ph\u00e1gan* sud 2nd, when in some parts interest at from \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) to one per cent a month begins to run on any sums in arrears.\n\n\\(^1\\) In some places, a tax according to means, *karm vero*, is levied both from cultivators and non-cultivators. A water cess, *p\u00e1ni p\u00edtho ne vero*, often levied from those who pay no other taxes, is in fact a tax for the right of living in a town or village. In M\u00e1nasa an oil and butter cess is levied from the non-cultivating classes. In Amliy\u00e1ra, a loom-tax, *s\u00e1l vero*, is levied on weavers, and a tax, *b\u00e1mbh vero*, on leather-dressers. In the same state the V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s have to pay a tiler's tax, *khal\u00e1sia vero*, originally levied to pay the chief's charges in having his roof put in order. In most places the levies from the non-cultivating classes are known vaguely as cesses, *ver\u00e1s*.\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nJUSTICE.\n\nIn 1855 the administration of justice was, except cases of murder and manslaughter, in the hands of the petty chieftains. Civil disputes were usually laid before arbitration courts, panchayats, and a compromise was generally the result. Robberies were commonly settled by the restitution of the stolen property, and the payment of a small fine. All civil and criminal cases, in which the parties concerned were the vassals of different chiefs, were referred to the Political Agent for investigation, who, as far as practicable, applied the Regulations of the Honourable Company's Courts.\n\nAt present justice is administered by the Political Agent and two assistants. The Idar chief at present is a minor, and his territory is directly managed by one of the assistants to the Political Agent. Under ordinary circumstances, this chief, whose estates include little less than one-half of the whole Mahi K\u00e1ntha population and revenue, is subject only to the Political Agent's general supervision and advice. In the other half of the Agency territory, the police and the administration of justice rest more or less entirely with the political officers. For some time past, the work of classifying the chiefs and grading their judicial powers, a measure attended in K\u00e1thi\u00e1war with such excellent results, has been in progress in the Mahi K\u00e1ntha. In the year 1875 a scheme submitted by the Political Agent received the sanction and approval of Government. Of the whole number of chiefs, fifty-two, who had previously exercised undefined judicial powers, were in 1876-77 arranged, according to their position and wealth, in seven classes, with varying civil and criminal jurisdiction. Chiefs of the first class have full civil and criminal powers, without, except under very special circumstances, any appeal or reference to the Political Agent; chiefs of the second class have full civil and criminal powers, subject, in the case of capital sentences and suits for more than \u00a32000 (Rs. 20,000), to the Political Agent's confirmation; chiefs of the third class have in criminal matters power to imprison for two years and fine up to \u00a3100 (Rs. 1000), and in civil matters can try cases of \u00a3500 (Rs. 5000) and under; chiefs of the fourth class can imprison for a year, fine up to \u00a350 (Rs. 500), and hear civil suits of less than \u00a3250 (Rs. 2500) in value; chiefs of the fifth class can imprison for six months, fine up to \u00a325 (Rs. 250), and hear civil suits of less than \u00a3100 (Rs. 1000) in value; chiefs of the sixth class can imprison for three months, fine up to \u00a310 (Rs. 100), and hear civil suits of less than \u00a350 (Rs. 500) in value; and chiefs of the seventh class can imprison for one month, fine up to \u00a35 (Rs. 50), and hear civil suits of less than \u00a325 (Rs. 250) in value. Of the whole number of fifty-two chiefs, one has been entrusted with first class\npowers, two with second, three with third, nine with fourth, nine with fifth, fourteen with sixth, and fourteen with seventh. The representatives of seven of the smallest estates have been considered unfit for the exercise of judicial powers. In the case of their lands, the whole civil and criminal jurisdiction, and in the case of the other chiefs the jurisdiction in questions beyond their power, rests with the Political Agent and his assistants.\n\nAs far as practicable the British Civil and Criminal Procedure and Indian Penal Codes are in force, but, in the wild Bhil tracts on the Rajputana frontier, all offences are dealt with under rules based on local customs. In Idar the old Stamp Act (X. of 1862) is in force. It has been, and still is, usual to settle civil suits by the arbitration of a jury, panchayat, of four persons, two of whom are named by the plaintiff and two by the defendant. As a rule the decisions thus passed give satisfaction. But lately the invasion of the province by pleaders, mukhtiaras, who set the people against arbitration, has made it less easy to get litigants to agree to the old mode of settling disputes. In 1879 of forty-one civil courts seventeen were presided over by the Political Agent, his two assistants, and the th\u00e1nd\u00e1rs and other minor Government officials; the remaining twenty-four were under the chiefs. The number of cases decided was 1355.\u00b9 The Registration Act is not in force, but the chiefs allow title deeds to be brought to them for their signature and seal, and obtain a fee from the parties concerned. In the Idar state during the year 1878-79 the number of title deeds registered was seventeen against twenty-two in the year before, and the amount realized in fees was \u00a327 (Rs. 270) against \u00a336 (Rs. 360).\n\nIn 1839 an important benefit was conferred on the Mahi K\u00e1ntha by the introduction of a Court of Criminal Justice for the trial of all serious offences, through the agency of the Political Agent with three chiefs as assessors. The establishment of this tribunal had a most wholesome effect on all classes and proved a powerful restraint on crime. Before the opening of this court, owing to the facility of evading justice, the indifference, and, in some cases, the want of power of the chiefs, crime was committed with comparative impunity. The number of magisterial courts rose from forty in 1850-51 to sixty-two in 1860-61, and was again in 1870-71 reduced to fifty-nine. At present (1878-79) forty-four officers and twenty-four chiefs exercise criminal jurisdiction. Besides the Political Agent who is vested with the powers both of a Sessions Judge and District Magistrate, and the two assistant political agents who are first class magistrates, there are one magistrate of the second class, and forty of the third class. Of the chiefs, two have criminal powers of the second class, three of the third, eight of the fourth, nine of the fifth, and two of the sixth. During the five years ending 1878-79, 8359 offences, or one offence for every 133 of the population were on an average committed, and about 1841 persons were convicted. Among the offences there were, on an average, five murders, three\n\n\u00b9 The average number of cases decided during the five years ending 1878-79 was 1453. From 1786 in 1874-75, the number fell to 1192 in 1875-76, rose to 1529 in 1876-77, and again fell to 1403 in 1877-78.\nculpable homicides, five grievous hurts, ten dacoities and highway robberies, and 3326 other offences. The number of violent deaths in 1878-79 was thirty-eight against forty-nine in the previous year. The marginal table shows the amount of property stolen and recovered during each of the five years ending 1878-79.\n\n| Year | Amount Stolen | Amount Recovered | Percentage |\n|------|---------------|------------------|------------|\n|      | \u00a3. s.         | \u00a3. s.            |            |\n| 1874-75 | 6253 6       | 1221 18          | 19 64      |\n| 1875-76 | 5432 16      | 1366 14          | 19 08      |\n| 1876-77 | 5365 10      | 1369 16          | 15 11      |\n| 1877-78 | 9824 2       | 2058 16          | 22 02      |\n| 1878-79 | 10,264 6     | 1448 6           | 16 05      |\n| Total  | 38,780 0     | 7320 10          | 18 87      |\n\nPolice.\n\nIn the Mahi K\u00e1ntha, surrounded by the territories of native chiefs, and with its north and east wild and hilly, police control is very imperfect. Except in Bhil and Koli villages which have only the headman, g\u00e1meti, who is bound to report offences, the system of a village watch, chaukid\u00e1rs, obtains throughout the province; at night the village watchmen, chiefly Rajputs, Musalm\u00e1ns, and Kolis, attend at the village office, ch\u00e1vda, or some other central spot. Of the village watch, the Kolis as chaukid\u00e1rs trace the footsteps of thieves so successfully, that stolen property is sometimes found after the tracks have been followed through several jurisdictions. Even if the stolen property is not found, the village into whose limits the footsteps are traced is, if its watchmen fail to carry on the track, held responsible and forced to make good the loss, a system of compensation known as vallar. When the tracks cannot be satisfactorily traced, or when from other causes the village fails in carrying them on, endeavours are made to discover the offenders by secretly holding out the offer of rewards, morkh\u00e1i, to any one who may give information. The informer, morkh\u00e1yo, is not always required to prove the correctness of his information by producing part of the stolen property. He generally gives a clue which is followed up. For instance, he names some of the offenders, who are questioned and their houses searched. In this way stolen property is often found out and the offenders brought to justice. Each sub-division, t\u00e1luka, has a police inspector, and each village a police patel, who has under him a certain number of village watchmen. In the whole district, Idar alone possesses a regular police force. It numbers 448 men, thirty mounted and 418 foot, armed with percussion muskets. The monthly cost is \u00a33840 (Rs. 38,400). The village police in Idar numbers 2378 men. Their annual emoluments in cash and grain amount to about \u00a3867 (Rs. 8670).\n\nPatrolling is carried on by detachments of the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r's Contingent of horse; these detachments move from village to village, and, whenever a crime is committed, report it to the police inspector of the t\u00e1luka, who proceeds at once to the spot to make inquiries. The following statement shows the number of police or persons doing police work in the province, exclusive of the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r's Contingent.\n\n---\n\n1 A constable, sipthi, in this force gets 12s. (Rs. 6) a month; a head constable, daf\u00e9d\u00e1r, 16s. (Rs. 8), and a chief constable, jam\u00e1dd\u00e1r, from \u00a31 10s. to \u00a34 (Rs. 15 - 40).\nThe two chief forms of crime are robbery and cattle stealing. Agrarian offences are few and cannot be traced to the pressure of creditors. Gang robbery and professional poisoning are unknown.\n\nThe R\u00e1thod Rajputs from M\u00e1rw\u00e1r, settled in the Mahi K\u00e1ntha, formerly practised female infanticide. The existence of this custom amongst them was first discovered by Colonel Lang, Political Agent, in 1839, and shortly afterwards he persuaded them to enter into engagements to abstain from the crime. In 1843 Government called on the Political Agent to impress on the chiefs how deep an interest Government took in the matter; to obtain a yearly census and forward regular reports; to issue a proclamation exhorting the chiefs to suppress the crime; to devise measures for the reward and protection of informers; to refer all charges to a committee, panchayat, of the chiefs, whose award should be subject to his confirmation, and generally to assimilate his measures to those already in force in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. The Political Agent was also told that the formation of an infanticide fund was thought highly expedient. The R\u00e1ja of Idar distinguished himself by the interest he showed in suppressing the crime. The first census was taken in 1848, but the results were untrustworthy. In the following year Captain Wallace reported the success of several prosecutions. The proportion of boys to girls was, at this time, 432 to 276 or about two boys to one girl. Since then the supervision has never been relaxed, and the last report (1878-79) shows a total of 287 boys and 234 girls. The infanticide fund amounts at present to \u00a3800 (Rs. 8000).\n\nIn consequence of the burning of three widows of the Ahmednagar chief in 1835, the state was in 1836 required to enter into an agreement renouncing the practice. In 1840 a proclamation was issued declaring that any village or state in which a case of widow burning occurred should be placed under attachment. Since then the practice has fallen into disuse.\n\nIncluding lock-ups there are (1878-79) twenty-six prisons. Of these one at S\u00e1dra, and the other at Idar are jails. The S\u00e1dra jail is a lock-up rather than a jail, as long-term prisoners are not kept there but sent to undergo their sentences at Ahmedabad. The jail at Idar is the state jail, where prisoners undergo any term of imprisonment. In 1878-79 the total number of inmates at all the prisons was 1233 and the cost \u00a32092 (Rs. 20,920) against 872 prisoners and \u00a31777 (Rs. 17,770) in the previous year.\nCHAPTER X.\n\nREVENUE AND FINANCE.\n\nIn 1845 the total estimated yearly revenue was between \u00a345,000 and \u00a350,000 (Rs. 4,50,000 - 5,00,000). From this amount the Gaikwar received a yearly tribute of \u00a38757 (Rs. 87,570) under the head of gh\u00e1sd\u00e1na, and \u00a34191 (Rs. 41,910) under jam\u00e1bandi, making a total of \u00a312,948 (Rs. 1,29,480). The financial returns for 1876-77 show, exclusive of alienations of which no detailed information is available, a gross revenue of \u00a379,171 (Rs. 7,91,710), and a gross expenditure of \u00a382,229 (Rs. 8,22,290).\n\nThe Idar revenue figures do not go further back than 1833 when the revenue was returned at \u00a38671 (Rs. 86,710). In 1848, including an increase of \u00a35216 (Rs. 52,160) from the lapse of Ahmednagar, it had risen to \u00a316,012 (Rs. 1,60,120). In 1855 it stood at \u00a316,885 (Rs. 1,68,850), and from this, during the late Maharaja's management, it rose to \u00a320,147 (Rs. 2,01,470) in 1859-60, and to \u00a325,288 (Rs. 2,52,880) in 1864-65, an increase chiefly due to the introduction of the crop-share, kaltor, system, to the high prices of grain, and to large receipts from fines. Since 1867, under the Political Agent, the revenue has risen to \u00a326,226 (Rs. 2,62,260), in 1875-76, \u00a326,824 (Rs. 2,68,240) in 1876-77, and \u00a328,559 (Rs. 2,85,590) in 1877-78. When taken over, the state was burdened with a debt of \u00a314,864 (Rs. 1,48,640). Though the ordinary expenditure is \u00a321,000 (Rs. 2,10,000), between 1867 and 1877, several large items raised the debt to \u00a333,342 (Rs. 3,33,420). Since 1877 this amount has been reduced by \u00a32150 (Rs. 21,500), and will, it is hoped, by the levy of special marriage, h\u00e1th garna, and installation, tika, cesses, be further reduced by about \u00a315,000 (Rs. 1,50,000). Of the smaller states D\u00e1nta comes second to Idar, with a revenue of \u00a34900 (Rs. 49,000); M\u00e1nasa third, with \u00a33952 (Rs. 39,520); \u00c1mliy\u00e1ra fourth, with \u00a32893 (Rs. 28,930); Mohanpur\n\n1 Besides this the yearly revenue of the Idar feudatories are estimated at about \u00a320,000 (Rs. 2,00,000). The 1878 returns show \u00a321,178 (Rs. 2,11,780).\n2 The chief items were: debt paid off, \u00a324,191 (Rs. 2,41,910); marriage charges of the daughters of the late and of the present chief, \u00a341,643 (Rs. 4,16,430); revenue survey, \u00a311,770 (Rs. 1,17,700); H\u00e1thmati bridge works, \u00a32436 (Rs. 24,360); chief's trip to Bombay to pay his respects to the Prince of Wales, \u00a34000 (Rs. 40,000); public works, \u00a37036 (Rs. 70,360), and miscellaneous state expenses \u00a34066 (Rs. 40,660). Total, \u00a395,143 (Rs. 9,51,430).\nfifth, with \u00a32700 (Rs. 27,000); Ghod\u00e1sar sixth, with \u00a32552 (Rs. 25,520); Katosan seventh, with \u00a32500 (Rs. 25,000); and Pol eighth, with \u00a32070 (Rs. 20,700). Of the rest seven had incomes between \u00a31000 and \u00a32000 (Rs. 10,000 - 20,000); twelve between \u00a3500 and \u00a31000 (Rs. 5,000 - 10,000); and twenty-six between \u00a3100 and \u00a3500 (Rs. 1000 - 5000). The state with the smallest revenue is Mot\u00e1kotarna, with \u00a371 (Rs. 710). Except a few claims amounting to \u00a3195 4s. 4\u00bdd. (Rs. 1952-3-3), the British Government draws no revenue from the Mahi K\u00e1ntha.\u00b9 The G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r\u2019s tribute amounting annually to \u00a312,948 6s. (Rs. 1,29,483) is collected by the Political Agent.\n\nThere are (1878) thirteen local funds with a total yearly revenue of \u00a31595 (Rs. 15,950). The following statement shows the chief 1878 details\u00b2:\n\n| Name                                      | Balance | Receipts | Expenditure | In Cash | In Government Promissory Notes | Total |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------|----------|-------------|---------|-------------------------------|-------|\n| 1.

Under the Director of public instruction and the Education Inspector, northern division, the schooling of the Mahi K\u00e1ntha was, in 1878-79, conducted by a local staff 160 strong. Of these one was a deputy inspector, with general charge over all the schools of the district, drawing a yearly pay of \u00a3180 (Rs. 1800); the rest were masters and assistant masters of schools with yearly salaries ranging from \u00a345 12s. (Rs. 456) to \u00a32 8s. (Rs. 24). Including the pay of the deputy inspector the total expenditure to the states was, in 1878-79, \u00a31724 (Rs. 17,236). Of fifty-five the total number of schools, in fifty-four Gujar\u00e1ti only is taught, and in one, the T\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri school, instruction is given both in English and Gujar\u00e1ti. Gujar\u00e1ti schools teach up to the sixth vernacular standard. The number of private, gamthi, schools has greatly fallen since the introduction of state schools. In 1878-79 it stood at thirty-four with an average attendance of 791 pupils, compared with fifty-five schools and 2400 pupils in 1855.\n\nIn 1845 school learning beyond the very simplest rudiments of the vernacular language and the least possible smattering of accounts, was almost unknown. Including the chiefs hardly any one could read or write, and the V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, seeing them entirely at their mercy, used every opportunity of enriching themselves at their expense. Ten years later (1855), though education had made some progress, it was confined to elementary instruction in reading, writing, and arithmetic among the Br\u00e1hmans, V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, and about one-half the children of the chiefs. The great hindrance to the spread of education was the impossibility of getting well-conducted and properly-trained teachers for the village schools. The following figures show the increased means for learning to read and write offered to the people of Mahi K\u00e1ntha during the last twenty years. In 1860 one school with fifty-two pupils on the rolls was kept up at a yearly cost of about \u00a345 (Rs. 450); in 1864-65 the number of schools remained the same, but the number of pupils rose to 138, and the expenditure to \u00a354 (Rs. 540).\n\n1 Mahi K\u00e1ntha pays only one-half of the salary and establishment of the deputy inspector. The other half is paid by P\u00e1lanpur.\n2 This attendance return is probably untrustworthy.\n3 Bom. Gov. Sel. XII. II, 97.\nThe 1870 returns shows a rise to twenty-six schools, 1542 pupils, and an expenditure of over \u00a3720 (Rs. 7200). By 1877-78 there was a still greater increase, the number of schools having risen to fifty-two, and of pupils to 2896, and the total cost to \u00a31283 (Rs. 12,880). In 1878-79 there were, as mentioned above, fifty-five schools and 2666 pupils, that is, compared with 1860, an increase in schools from one to fifty-five, and in pupils from 52 to 2666.\n\nOf the fifty-five schools three are girls' schools, two in N\u00e1ni M\u00e1rw\u00e1r and one in the S\u00e1bar K\u00e1ntha, with an average monthly attendance of eighty pupils.\n\nOf 2708, the total number of pupils in Government and aided private schools, there were in 1878-79, 664 or 24\u00b75 per cent Br\u00e1hmans; 6 writers, K\u00e1yasths or Parbh\u00fas; 1096 traders, 581 or 21\u00b74 per cent of them Jains, and 515 or 19\u00b701 per cent V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, Bhati\u00e1s, and Loh\u00e1n\u00e1s; 295 or 10\u00b78 per cent cultivators, Kanbis and Kolis; 86 or 3\u00b71 per cent Rajputs; 257 or 9\u00b74 per cent artisans, goldsmiths, blacksmiths, and carpenters; and 57 or 2\u00b71 per cent craftsmen, oil-pressers, and vegetable-dealers; 4 personal servants, washermen, water-carriers, and palanquin-bearers; 41 or 1\u00b75 per cent miscellaneous; 12 Mochis, shoemakers; and 148 or 5\u00b74 per cent Musalm\u00e1ns, 67 or 2\u00b74 per cent of them Bohor\u00e1s. No Bhangia or Dhed boys attended the schools.\n\nIn the Mahi K\u00e1ntha there is a library at S\u00e1dra and a reading room at Idar, but no local newspaper. The library at S\u00e1dra known as the 'Mahi K\u00e1ntha Native Library' was established in November 1874. The number of subscribers is returned at thirty-nine and the average annual collection at \u00a321 (Rs. 210). Besides these, the library has donations amounting to \u00a3449 (Rs. 4490). It has a building of its own and is provided with 228 books, 141 of them vernacular and 87 English. A small lithographic press belonging to the Idar state is used for making copies of notices and official forms.\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nHEALTH.\n\nThe prevailing diseases\\(^1\\) are intermittent and remittent fevers, parasitic diseases such as itch, ring worm, round and thread worms, eye diseases, and to a less extent dysentery. All these, except round and thread worms which owe their origin to unwholesome food, are due to the bad sanitary state of the villages. Where drainage and cleanness have been attended to, a decided decrease in endemic disease has followed. The change is most marked at Idar where ulcers do not present the same unhealthy character as before. Cholera, small-pox, and intermittent fever, are prevalent, but not severe. Cholera appears in the hot season and disappears after a good fall of rain. Small-pox and fever prevail at all times. At Idar there are a few native practitioners, vaids, who carry on their occupation and attend the inmates of the palace. In simple cases they are generally successful, in critical cases they invariably fail.\n\nThere are two dispensaries, one at S\u00e1dra the Agency head-quarters where there is also an hospital, and the other at Idar the head-quarters of the Idar state. The number of patients treated at the S\u00e1dra dispensary in 1877-78 was 3919, a number less than that of the previous year by 989. The daily average attendance at this dispensary was 42\u00b719, and the cost \u00a3340 (Rs. 3400). The Idar dispensary also shows a falling off in the number of patients, 1957 against 2502 in 1876-77. The average daily attendance was 16\u00b755, and the cost of the dispensary \u00a3192 (Rs. 1920).\n\nVaccinators are employed throughout the province, and are generally well received, except by the Bhils who refuse to have anything to do with them. In 1877-78 five vaccinators operated on 10,738 persons or 890 less than in 1876-77; 10,549 operations were successful, and the cost amounted to \u00a3141 (Rs. 1410).\n\nA disease termed jerb\u00e1th, inflammation of the lungs, has been prevalent among the oxen for the last three years and is believed to be caused by over-work. There is a home, p\u00e1njr\u00e1pol, at Peth\u00e1pur for cows, buffaloes, bullocks, and horses. Some of them are maimed, diseased, and some are healthy. They are sent to the hospital, either because their masters wish them to pass a pleasant old age, or\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) In 1855 the prevailing diseases were intermittent fevers, dysentery, diarrhoea, cholera, small-pox, measles, liver complaints, and enlarged spleens. Small-pox was an annual visitation carrying off vast numbers, while cholera appeared about every three or four years. Vaccination was progressing favourably. Bom. Gov. Sel. XII. 93.\nbecause they have become useless to them. Animals born in the hospital belong to the hospital. Those that are of any use are either set to work or sold, and the proceeds credited to the hospital. The animals are well fed on grass, hay, pulse, and millet, the healthy ones grazing during the day with the rest of the village cattle. The home is under the management of the mah\u00e1jan or trade guild, who support it at a yearly cost of about \u00a390 (Rs. 900). Any one sending an animal has to pay something either in money or grain, but the rates are not fixed. All animals, except those attacked with contagious diseases, are admitted into the hospital. When they are diseased, efforts are made to cure them. When an animal dies its carcase is taken away by the Ch\u00e1madi\u00e1s or tanners. A special part of the home is used as a worm-room, jiv\u00e1t kh\u00e1na, where the vermin that infest grain are kept. Grain attacked by vermin is spread on a cloth and laid in the sun. As the grain grows hot, the animals leave it and sticking to the cloth are caught, put in a vessel, and carried off to the worm-house.\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nSTATES.\n\nChapter XIII. Idar, bounded on the north by Sirohi and Meyw\u00e1r, on the east by Dungarpur, and on the south and west by the Ahmedabad district and the territories of the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r, has an estimated area of 2500 square miles, a population in 1872 of 217,382 souls, and a yearly revenue of about \u00a360,000 (Rs. 6,00,000) of which about \u00a335,000 (Rs. 3,50,000) belong to petty chiefs\u00b9 and under-lords, and \u00a325,000 (Rs. 2,50,000) to the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja of Idar.\n\nAspect. Except a level and sandy tract in the south-west, the country is fertile, full of wild well-wooded hills and rivers. In the cold and rainy seasons it is very beautiful.\n\nRivers. Of the five rivers that flow through the state, the S\u00e1bar, the H\u00e1thmati, the Meshva, the M\u00e1jam and the V\u00e1trak, the S\u00e1bar, rising in the Meyw\u00e1r hills, passes through the north and, taking a southerly course, forms the western boundary of the state for about twenty miles. The H\u00e1thmati, coming from the north-east frontier and crossing through the middle of the state, joins the S\u00e1bar near Ahmednagar, the joint stream being then called S\u00e1barmati. The Meshva, entering from the east, passes near the sacred town of Saml\u00e1ji, and, taking a south-westerly course, leaves the district, and meets the V\u00e1trak near Kaira. The M\u00e1jam, rising in the hills near Dungarpur, and, taking a course similar to that of the Meshva, meets the V\u00e1trak near the \u00c1mliy\u00e1ra state. The V\u00e1trak passes near Meghraj in the south-east, and, taking a south-westerly course, meets the M\u00e1jam and leaves the district to join the S\u00e1barmati at Vautha in Dhokla.\n\nHills. Idar has many hills, some of considerable size and height, and all clothed with trees and brushwood. On one range that joins the \u00c1r\u00e1vali and Vindhya mountains stands the fort of Idar.\n\n\u00b9 The names of the cadets of the Idar house, of its vassals, sard\u00e1r pat\u00e9vats, and of the villages of the original landlords, bhum\u00edds, are (a) cadets of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja's family, Jagatsingji Hamirsingji Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j of Suvar, Sard\u00e1rsingji Indrasingji Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j of D\u00e1var, Bhimsingji Indrasingji Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j of Nuya, and B\u00e1jj\u00ed Kes\u00e1rji L\u00e9l the daughter of R\u00e1n\u00edji Chauv\u00e1n\u00edji of Vir\u00e1v\u00e1da; (b) vassals, sard\u00e1r pat\u00e9vats, Hamirsingji R\u00e1isingji of Chandurni, Indrabanji Surajmalji of Mondeti, Mohbatsingji Hamirsingji of Mehd\u00e1san, Dipsingji Daulatsingji of T\u00edntoi, Arjunsingji Narsingji of Undni, Bharatsingji Gop\u00e1l singji of Mau, Ajitsingji Daulatsingji of Kukuria, and Dalpatningji Kum\u00e1nsingji of G\u00e1nthiol; (c) estates of original land-lords, bhum\u00edds, P\u00e1l, Kheroj, Ghorvada, Mori (Meghraj), Posina, Ver\u00e1bar, Pala, Budell, T\u00e1ka Tunka, Kuska, S\u00e1meyra, J\u00e1lia, Dehg\u00e1mra, Vanti\u00f3le, Vassayt, Dhambolia, N\u00e1disan, Survna, G\u00e1mboi, Mor-Dungra, Mohri (Devni), Karcha, Derol,\nExcept in the extremes of heat and cold to which its northern hilly parts are subject, the climate differs little from other parts of central Gujar\u00e1t. The mean maximum range of the thermometer during April and May, the hottest months, is from $104^\\circ$ to $105^\\circ$, and the mean minimum from $75^\\circ$ to $78^\\circ$. In July and August the mean maximum is from $87^\\circ$ to $95^\\circ$, and the mean minimum from $75^\\circ$ to $76^\\circ$. In December and January the mean maximum is from $87^\\circ$ to $89^\\circ$ and the mean minimum is $53^\\circ$.\n\nThe 1872 census showed a total population of 217,382 souls or 87 to the square mile. Of the whole number, 209,641 or 96.43 per cent were Hindus, and 7741 or 3.57 per cent Musalm\u00e1ns. Of the Hindus, 16,503 were priests, Br\u00e1hmans; 63 writers, 48 K\u00e1yasths, and 15 Kshatris; 8688 traders, V\u00e1mi\u00e1s; 48,698 cultivators, 36,952 Kanbis, 9596 Rajputs, 1583 S\u00e1gors, 486 M\u00e1lis, and 81 Sat\u00edv\u00e1r\u00e1s; 15,449 artisans, 4290 Kumbh\u00e1rs, potters, 3089 Suth\u00e1rs, carpenters, 2912 Luh\u00e1rs, blacksmiths, 2873 Darj\u00eds, tailors, 729 Sonis, gold and silversmiths, 498 Bh\u00e1vs\u00e1rs, calico-printers, 457 Sal\u00e1ts, masons, 367 Kadi\u00e1s, bricklayers, 146 Gh\u00e1nchis, oil-pressers, 66 Khar\u00e1dis, turners, 19 Khatris, weavers of silk and cotton, and 3 Kans\u00e1r\u00e1s, coppersmiths; 2632 Bh\u00e1ts and Ch\u00e1rans, bards and genealogists; 3290 personal servants, 2490 of them Haj\u00e1ms, barbers, 671 Bhois, palanquin-bearers, 113 Dhobhis, washermen; 16 Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, servants and labourers; 4567 R\u00e1ik\u00e1s, shepherds; 8999 miscellaneous workers, 4280 of them Ods, diggers, 1970 R\u00e1vali\u00e1s, cotton-tape makers and beggars, 1191 Vanj\u00e1r\u00e1s, wandering tribes, 1022 Kal\u00e1ls, tavern-keepers, 262 Ch\u00e1m\u00e1di\u00e1s, tanners, 206 V\u00e1ghris, fowlers and hunters, 48 B\u00e1vch\u00e1s and Thoris, labourers, 20 Baj\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, acrobats; 70,959 Kolis and 7592 Bhils, unsettled classes; 813 Mochis, shoemakers; 7972 Dheds, 7063 Bh\u00e1mbhis, 3217 Bhangi\u00e1s, 2005 Garud\u00e1s or Dhed priests, and 1141 religious beggars.\n\nPoor in natural products and manufactures, Idar has but a scanty trade. Formerly Idar merchants dealt largely in opium, but of late Government has monopolised the trade. The S\u00e1ml\u00e1ji and Khedbrahma fairs give some impetus to local traffic. But the more important trade both in exports and imports is with Bombay, Poona, Ahmedabad, Prat\u00e1pgad, and Visnagar. The chief exports are clarified butter, doti cloth, grain of all sorts, honey, leather, molasses, oil, oil-seeds, soap, stone, and timber; the chief imports, brass, copper vessels, cotton, molasses, English and Indian piece goods, salt, sugar, and tobacco. The only industry of any importance is the manufacture of soap at Ahmednagar.\n\nIdar is first known in tradition as Ildurg, the residence in the Dv\u00e1par Y\u00fag, or third age, of Elvan the R\u00e1kshas, and his brother V\u00e1t\u00e1pi. These demons, man-eaters who harassed and laid waste the country round, were at last destroyed by the seer Agastya. In the Kali Y\u00fag, or present age, when Yudhishthir was fresh in men's memories and Vikram had not yet risen to free the world from debt, Veni Vachh R\u00e1j ruled in Idar. He owned a magic gold figure which gave him money for building the Idar fortress and reservoirs.\nVeni Vachh R\u00e1j\u2019s queen was a N\u00e1gputri, the daughter of one of the Snake Kings of the under world. After living together happily for some time, as they were seated in an oriel window in Idargad, a corpse, followed by a train of mourners, chanced to pass. Asking what the procession meant, the R\u00e1ni was told that one of them was dead and that the rest were mourning. \u2018Let us leave a place where men die\u2019 said the R\u00e1ni, and she and the king went together to the hill of T\u00e1ran M\u00e1ta, and entering a cleft in the rock, close to where the goddess is now worshipped, they were no more seen. Then the land lay desolate for many years.\n\nWhen Valabhinagar fell\\(^1\\) (770), Pushp\u00e1vati, one of Shil\u00e1ditya\u2019s queens, was at the \u00c1r\u00e1sur shrine of Amba Bhav\u00e1ni, fulfilling a vow, for the goddess had heard her prayer and she was with child. On her way back Pushp\u00e1vati heard that Valabhi had fallen and that she was a widow. Taking refuge in a mountain cave, she was delivered of a son, whom she named \u2018Goha\u2019 the Cave-born. Leaving the babe in the charge of a Br\u00e1hman woman, and telling her to bring him up as one of her own sons but to marry him to a Rajput\u2019s daughter, she mounted the funeral pile and followed her lord. Idar was then in the hands of the Bhils, and the young Goha, leaving his Br\u00e1hman mother, took to the woods with the Bhils, and, by his daring, won their hearts. One day the Bhils in sport choosing a king, the choice fell on Goha, and one \u2018of the children of the forest\u2019 cutting his finger rubbed the blood on Goha\u2019s forehead as the sovereign mark, tilak. Thus Goha, the son of Shil\u00e1ditya, became lord of the forests and mountains of Idar. His descendants are said to have ruled for seven generations, till the Bhils tired of strangers, attacked and slew N\u00e1g\u00e1ditya, the eighth prince of the line. His infant son B\u00e9pa, then only three years old, was saved to become, twelve years later (974), the founder of the Meyw\u00e1r dynasty.\\(^2\\) Then the city fell into ruins.\n\nSome time after, a band of Parih\u00e1r Rajputs, from Mandovar in M\u00e1rw\u00e1r, binding the garland upon its gates, refounded Idar, and ruled there for several generations. In the time of one of these Parih\u00e1r rulers, Amarsing by name, the R\u00e1ja of Kanouj, performing a sacrifice in honour of his daughter\u2019s marriage, sent letters of invitation to the neighbouring R\u00e1j\u00e1s. Idar was then subject to Chitor, and Samarshi R\u00e1val of Chitor, invited by his brother-in-law Pruthur\u00e1j to accompany him to the marriage, summoned his vassal Amarsing to attend him. The Parih\u00e1r chieftain, with his son and a body of five thousand horse, went to Chitor, and soon after (1193) the Idar force was cut to pieces in the great slaughter of Thanessar. When the news reached Idar, many of the Ranis cast themselves from the steep cliff to the north of the town, still known as the \u2018Ranis\u2019 Leap\u2019 or \u2018Murder Hill\u2019.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) General Cunningham gives 658.

R\u00e1jasth\u00e1n, I. 191.\nAmarsing had left Idar in the hands of a servant H\u00e1thi Sord, a Koli, in whom he had every trust. H\u00e1thi held the country till his death, and was succeeded by his son S\u00e1malio Sord, in whose time the R\u00e1thods first (1257) appeared in Idar.\n\nDriven south by the Muhammadans, the R\u00e1thods, about the end of the twelfth century, under the guidance of Siyoji, the son or nephew of Jaychand Dale P\u00e1nglo of Kanouj, established themselves in the sandy deserts of M\u00e1rwar. Siyoji's second son, Sonangji, repaired to the court of Anhilv\u00e1da, whose sovereign, probably Bhim Dev II. (1177-1215), assigned him the fief of S\u00e1metra in the district of Kadi. And not many years after the R\u00e1thods won for themselves the fort and lands of Idar. The local story of this conquest is, that S\u00e1malio Sord by his tyranny roused his subjects' discontent. His chief adviser, a N\u00e1gar Br\u00e1hman, had a beautiful daughter, whom S\u00e1malio demanded in marriage. The father, not daring to refuse, begged half a year's delay. This was granted, and in the interval he paid a visit to S\u00e1metra, and, introducing himself to Sonangji, asked him if he was bold enough to take Idar. Sonangji agreed to try, and the Br\u00e1hman, returning home, declared that he was making preparations for the marriage and was assembling his relations. By twos and threes a hundred carriages, supposed to contain Br\u00e1hman women, brought to the minister's mansion the R\u00e1thod warriors and their leader. The minister at length gave out that all was ready, and asked S\u00e1malio and his relations to the feast. After the arrival of the bridegroom and his party, intoxicating drugs and liquor were freely served, and, on the minister's ordering his servants to bring the second course, the Rajputs rushed forward and surrounded the banquet hall. S\u00e1malio strove to cut his way through his enemies and regain the fortress, but, within a short distance of the gate of Idargad, fell mortally wounded. When Sonangji came to the spot where he lay dying, S\u00e1malio, raising himself for the last time, made the royal mark on the victorious R\u00e1thod's brow, and with his dying breath begged that each R\u00e1thod R\u00e1o on mounting the royal cushion should be marked with the tilak by a Sord, who should draw the blood from his own right hand, and say 'May the kingdom of S\u00e1malio Sord flourish.' Spots on the ascent to Idargad, still pointed to as S\u00e1malio's blood stains, are marked by the Hindus with vermilion on 'the dark fourteenth' and other days on which Hanum\u00e1n is worshipped, and, to the present time, when a fresh descendant of Sonangji seats himself on the cushion of his ancestors in their last retreat at Pol, a Koli of Sarv\u00e1n marks his forehead with blood in token of his yet unsurrendered title to S\u00e1malio's domains. For the next four generations the Idar territories remained unchanged. Then Rannal, the fifth in descent from Sonangji, took from a Y\u00e1dav family the country called the Bh\u00e1gar between Idar and Meyw\u00e1r.\n\nDuring this time Muhammadan power had spread over Gujar\u00e1t, and Idar had been forced to acknowledge its supremacy. According\n\n---\n\n1 R\u00e1s M\u00e1la, 233 - 235.\n2 Tod's R\u00e1jasth\u00e1n, II. 2.\n3 R\u00e1s M\u00e1la, 236, 237.\nto one account Muzaffar, one of Ala-ud-din\u2019s (1295 - 1315) generals took Idar, and it seems probable that Idar was unable to avoid sharing in the general submission enforced by Alph Kh\u00e1n in the early years of the fourteenth century (1300 - 1317). Muhammad Tughluk (1325-1351), about forty years later, on entering Gujar\u00e1t to quell a revolt, first turned his arms against the chiefs of the north-east frontier, and Idar was probably included in the settlement of the province, a work on which the Emperor spent the next three years (1347 - 1350). Under the weaker rulers that followed Muhammad, Idar would seem to have been left unmolested till, near the close of the century, Musalm\u00e1n supremacy was again enforced by Zafar Kh\u00e1n, afterwards Muzaffar Sh\u00e1h the founder of the Ahmedabad dynasty.\n\nIn 1393, the Idar chief refusing to pay his tribute, the Viceroy invested his fort, and after a long siege, forcing the garrison to surrender, extorted a large payment of money and jewels. Five years later (1398) Zafar Kh\u00e1n, determining to reduce Idar, besieged the fort and laid the country waste. While the garrison held out, news came of Timur\u2019s overthrow of the Delhi Emperor, and concluding a peace with Ranmal, Zafar Kh\u00e1n returned to P\u00e1tan (1401). After three years, according to one account, he again marched to levy the tribute of Idar when the chief fled to Visalnagar leaving Zafar Kh\u00e1n to occupy his capital. If this account is correct the Idar chief must soon after have been restored, for, in the revolt that followed the death of Muzaffar Sh\u00e1h (1411), two of the rebels, Moid-ud-din Firoz Kh\u00e1n the cousin, and Masti Kh\u00e1n the uncle of Sult\u00e1n Ahmad I., were aided by Ranmal the Idar chief, and took refuge in his fortress. Sult\u00e1n Ahmad sending troops against the rebels forced them to flee to N\u00e1g\u00f3r, and R\u00e1o Ranmal despairing of success made peace with the king by surrendering his horses, elephants, and other war materials (1414).\n\nAbout thirteen years later (1426) Sult\u00e1n Ahmad again marched against Idar, defeated the force brought to meet him, and drove R\u00e1o Punja, the successor of Ranmal, to the hills. Idar was always a troublesome neighbour and difficult to subdue, for, when his country was threatened, the chief could retire to his hills where he could not easily be followed. As a permanent check on his movements, Ahmad Sh\u00e1h, in 1427, built the fort of Ahmednagar on the banks of the H\u00e1thmati. In the following year (1428) during a frontier foray, R\u00e1o Punja, repulsed and pursued by the Muhammadan cavalry, galloped towards Idar, and, as he passed along a path at the edge of a ravine, his horse shied, and, falling into the chasm below, killed his rider. After R\u00e1o Punja\u2019s death Sult\u00e1n Ahmad marched on Idar and did not return till Punja\u2019s son N\u00e1rand\u00e1s had\n\n---\n\n1 Tar\u00edkh-i-Firoz Sh\u00e1hi : Elliot\u2019s Hist.

Next year R\u00e1o N\u00e1rand\u00e1s failing to pay his tribute, Sult\u00e1n Ahmad again marched to Idar, and, on the 14th of November, carried by storm one of the chief forts in the province, probably Idargad, and built in it a magnificent mosque.\n\nIn 1445 Muhammad II., the son and successor of Ahmad, marched against R\u00e1o Bh\u00e1n, the brother and successor of N\u00e1rand\u00e1s, who by the Muhammadans is called Bir or Vir R\u00e1\u00ed. R\u00e1o Bh\u00e1n for a time took to the hills; but afterwards agreeing to give the Sult\u00e1n his daughter in marriage, his possessions were confirmed to him. The R\u00e1o appears to have remained quiet during the reign of Mahmud Begada, as, from 1459 to 1513 no mention is made of any expedition against him. R\u00e1o Bh\u00e1n left two sons, Surajmal and Bhim. Surajmal ruled for only eighteen months, leaving a son R\u00e1imalji, whose place was, in his minority, usurped by his uncle Bhim. In 1514 R\u00e1o Bhim defeated Ain-ul-mulk, governor of P\u00e1tan, who on his way to Ahmedabad had turned aside to attack the R\u00e1o. So daring a success brought on the R\u00e1o the full weight of the king\u2019s displeasure. Advancing with a great army he found Idar abandoned, and destroyed it. At this time Muzaffar was anxious to advance into M\u00e1lwa, and, on receiving a large sum of money, made peace with the R\u00e1o. R\u00e1o Bhim, on his death, was succeeded by his son Bh\u00e1rmal, who soon after was deposed by R\u00e1na Sang of Chitor, whose daughter was married to R\u00e1imal the son of Surajmal. In 1515 Bh\u00e1rmal sought the aid of Sult\u00e1n Muzaffar, and he sending Niz\u00e1m-ul-mulk, one of his chief officers, replaced Bh\u00e1rmal as ruler of Idar. R\u00e1imal did not despair, and two years after again appearing in Idar, defeated a Muhammadan officer Zehr-ul-mulk, the Jher Kh\u00e1n of Hindu tradition. Soon after this R\u00e1imal died, and Bh\u00e1rmal became the undisputed chief. But his capital remained in the hands of the Musalm\u00e1ns. In 1519 in the presence of Mub\u00e1riz-ul-mulk, governor of Idar, some one praised the bravery of R\u00e1na Sang of Chitor. Mub\u00e1riz, to show his contempt, ordered a dog to be tied to the gate of the Idar fort, and to be called R\u00e1na Sang. Hearing of this insult, R\u00e1na Sang marched against Idar. Mub\u00e1riz having only 900 men retired to Ahmednagar, and Sang taking Idar and marching against Ahmednagar defeated Mub\u00e1riz and plundered the town. This Hindu success did not last long. In the next year (Dec. 1520) Sult\u00e1n Muzaffar marched on Idar and again took it. During the Musalm\u00e1n occupation of their capital, the R\u00e1os are said to have lived at Sarv\u00e1n, the village held by the descendants of S\u00e1malio Sord, formerly in Idar and now in Meyw\u00e1r. The Musalm\u00e1ns do not seem to have held Idar for any length of time. R\u00e1o Bh\u00e1rmal again occupied his capital and was twice attacked by Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h in 1528 and in 1530. The second expedition seems to have reduced R\u00e1o Bh\u00e1rmal to obedience, as mention is made that in 1530 Bah\u00e1dur led an army into B\u00e1yad and the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Idar and Dungarpur were present.\n\n---\n\n1 Watson\u2019s Gujar\u00e1t, 36.\n2 1428, R\u00e1s M\u00e1la, 269.\n3 Watson\u2019s Gujar\u00e1t, 37.\n4 Bom.

During Punj\u00e1ji\u2019s time the power of the Ahmedabad kings greatly declined, and, as he is never mentioned, the Idar chief was probably left in almost complete independence. Afterwards in the reigns of the last Ahmedabad kings (1540-1572), the R\u00e1o of Idar was freed from the demand of tribute on agreeing to serve with 2000 horse.\u00b9 Punj\u00e1ji was succeeded by his son N\u00e1randa\u015b, a great ascetic, who lived only on grain that had first been eaten by cows.\u00b2\n\nIn 1573, N\u00e1randa\u015b took part in the revolt against Kh\u00e1n Aziz Koka, the Viceroy of Gujar\u00e1t. This revolt was checked by Akbar in person, and, in 1575 and again in 1576, expeditions were sent against Idar. In the last of these the R\u00e1o fled, and Idar fell into the Emperor\u2019s hands. Following his usual policy, Akbar, asking for no more than an admission of his supremacy, restored the R\u00e1o to his state and made him a commander of 2000 infantry and 500 cavalry.\u00b3 R\u00e1o N\u00e1randa\u015b was succeeded by Viramdev, a favourite hero with the bards. Viramdev left no son, and, in supersession of his elder brother Gop\u00e1ld\u00e1s, was succeeded by his brother Kali\u00e1nmal. Going to Delhi, Gop\u00e1ld\u00e1s took service with the Emperor in the hope of being helped to regain Idar. At length, advancing at the head of an army, he took possession of M\u00e1ndva, planning from there an advance on Idar. While at M\u00e1ndva, L\u00e1l Mia,\u2074 the Mus\u00e1l\u00e1n landlord of that place, fell on him, and Gop\u00e1ld\u00e1s, with fifty-two Rajputs, was slain.\n\nWhen he went to Delhi, Gop\u00e1ld\u00e1s left his family at the hamlet of a cowherd named Volo. On growing up Gop\u00e1ld\u00e1s\u2019 sons made the hamlet their head quarters, calling it Val\u00e1sna after the cowherd, and gradually encroached on the country round till their lands included the estates of great and little Val\u00e1sna. At the same time Kali\u00e1nmal, the ruler of Idar, conquered from Meyw\u00e1r the districts of P\u00e1navda, Palh\u00e1ri, Jav\u00e1s, Jora, P\u00e1thia, Valecha and others that had been brought under Meyw\u00e1r in the reign of Viramdev. Kali\u00e1nmal was succeeded by his son R\u00e1o Jagann\u00e1th. During Kali\u00e1nmal\u2019s rule two political parties had been formed, one including the proprietors of Vas\u00e1\u00ed, Mondeti, and Kar\u00ed\u00e1daru supported by the chiefs of Posina and Dorol; and the other including Garibd\u00e1s, the Rohvar Th\u00e1kor of Ran\u00e1san, the chief Muhammadan Kasb\u00e1tis of Idar, and Motichand Sh\u00e1l, proprietor of Vad\u00e1l\u00ed. In these times (about 1650) the Gujar\u00e1t Viceroys began to levy the Idar tribute more regularly than before, and Vet\u00e1l Bh\u00e1rot of Baroda was the Emperor\u2019s security for the Idar chiefs. This security became in time his creditor for so large an amount that the R\u00e1o determined to get rid of him, and bringing a charge of fornication against him, drove him out of Idar. Upon this Vet\u00e1l going to Delhi sought the Emperor\u2019s help, promising to bring Idar into his hands. The Emperor ordered Prince Mur\u00e1d, then Viceroy of Ahmedabad\n\n\u00b9 Bird\u2019s Mir\u00e1t-i-Ahmadi, 127.\n\u00b2 Gladwin\u2019s \u00c1in-i-Akbari, II. 64.\n\u00b3 Gladwin\u2019s \u00c1in-i-Akbari II. 64. The yearly revenue of Idar was, at this time, returned at about \u00a34000 (16,16,000 d\u00e0ms) and that of Ahmednagar at \u00a34500 (17,70,912 d\u00e0ms). According to the Mir\u00e1t-i-Ahmadi (Bird, 343), Idar was taken in 1573 and again (Bird, 349) attacked in 1578.\n\u2074 This L\u00e1l Mia was probably an ancestor of the present mia of M\u00e1ndva.\n(1654-1657), to help Vetal with 5000 horse. The Rao's agent at the court of Delhi sent word of the threatened danger. But on Vetal's assurance that the rumour was false, the Rao made no preparation. Soon after, Prince Murad appeared, and, the Rao retiring to Pol, Idar was taken without a blow (1656). Placing a Muhammadan officer Syed Hatto in command, Prince Murad continued the Idar ministers in the management of affairs. Soon after, in his retreat at Pol, Rao Jagannath died.\n\nHis son Punja, then a minor, went to Delhi to receive investiture, but failing by the rivalry of the Jeypur Raja, fled in disguise and joined his mother at Udepur. Helped by the Rana of Udepur, Rao Punja, in 1658, won back Idar, where he lived, placing his Ranas and treasure at Sarvan. Poisoned after ruling for about six months, he was succeeded by his brother Arjundas, who while attacking Ranasan was slain by the Rehvars. On Arjundas' death, Rao Jagannath's brother Gopinath began plundering as far as Ahmedabad, and was bought off by Syed Hatto, the Musalm\u00e1n governor, by money payments. This blackmail, vol, the Pol Raos still levy from Idar. Syed Hatto was replaced by Kamal Khan, an indolent man whom Rao Gopinath drove out, and, regaining Idar, held it for five years (1664). Garibdas Rehvar, who was at the head of a party in Idar, fearing that Gopinath would take vengeance for Arjundas, brought an army from Ahmedabad to drive him out. The Rao fled to the hills and died for want of opium of which he was accustomed to take a pound and a quarter a day. The affairs of Idar now fell into the hands of Motichand Shah, proprietor of Vadali, and the proprietor of Vasai, Garibdas being the chief minister. In 1679 Karansing, Gopinath's son, drove out the Muhammadan garrison from Idar and regained possession of his capital. Shortly after, Muhammad Amin Khan and Muhammad Bahlo Kh\u00e1n retook Idar, the chief flying to Sarvan where he stayed till his death.\n\nKaransing had two sons, Chando or Chandrasing, and Madhavsing. Madhavsing took possession of Verabar, which his descendants still hold. For several years Idar remained in the hands of a Musalm\u00e1n garrison commanded by Muhammad Bahlo Kh\u00e1n. In 1696 Chandrasing began to make raids on the Idar territory, and in 1718 the proprietors of Vasai having driven out the Muhammadan garrison, brought him back to Idar. His soldiers getting clamorous for their pay he gave Sardarsing of Val\u00e1sna as security, and entrusting the government to him retired to Pol. Putting the ruler a Parihar Rajput to death, he seated himself on the royal cushion and founded the present ruling family of Pol. At Idar, after for a time ruling in Chandrasing's name, Sardarsing was raised to the chiefship; but afterwards quarrelling with the Kasbatis he had to retire to Val\u00e1sna. Baha Pandit then ruled in Idar till in 1731 he was driven out by Mahar\u00e1jas Anandsing and Raising, brothers of Mahar\u00e1ja Abhaysing of Jodhpur.\n\n---\n\n1 Ras Mala, 342. Bom. Gov. Sel. XII. 107, gives 1655.\n2 Watson's Gujarat, 81.\n3 Ras Mala, 346. This date seems uncertain. Bom. Gov. Sel. XII. 107, gives 1728; Bombay Chiefs, 1729; and Thornton, 1724.\nOf the succession of the Jodhpur chiefs of the R\u00e1thod clan two stories are told; one that they were called in by the Idar ministers; the other that they had been in revolt against their brother, the Mahar\u00e1ja Abhaysing, Viceroy of Gujar\u00e1t, and had been pacified by the grant of Idar.\n\nIn 1734 Jaw\u00e1n Mard Kh\u00e1n, one of the leading Gujar\u00e1t Musalm\u00e1n nobles, marched on Idar. \u00c1nandsing and R\u00e1ising sought the aid of Malh\u00e1r R\u00e1o Holkar and R\u00e1noji Sindia, who were at this time in M\u00e1lwa. The Mar\u00e1tha chiefs at once marched to their help, and Jaw\u00e1n Mard Kh\u00e1n, who found himself opposed to an overwhelming army, was forced to agree to pay a sum of \u00a317,500 (Rs. 1,75,000). At the close of the rainy season of 1738, Momin Kh\u00e1n (1738-1743) the Viceroy of Gujar\u00e1t came to Idar and levied tribute from the chiefs of Mohanpur and Ran\u00e1san. This tribute \u00c1nandsing and Raising claimed as being within the limits of their own territory. But the dispute was amicably settled, R\u00e1ising, at Momin Kh\u00e1n\u2019s request, remaining with him, and Momin Kh\u00e1n agreeing to pay his men\u2019s expenses. In 1741 Rangoji, the Mar\u00e1tha chief, induced R\u00e1ising to leave Momin Kh\u00e1n and join his service, but Momin soon detached R\u00e1ising from this alliance by conferring on him the districts of Mod\u00e1sa, K\u00e1nkroj, Ahmednagar, Par\u00e1ntij, and Harsol. Next year (1742) the Rehvar Rajputs attacked and took Idar killing the chief Raja \u00c1nandsing. On hearing of this disaster his brother R\u00e1ising, taking leave from Momin Kh\u00e1n, went to Idar, attacked and drove out the Rehvars, and placing \u00c1nandsing\u2019s son, Shivsing, a boy of six years on the throne, himself acted as minister. R\u00e1ising died in 1750.\n\nDuring the Mar\u00e1tha and Musalm\u00e1n struggles which ended in the Mar\u00e1tha capture of Ahmedabad in 1757, Shivsing would seem to have sided with the Musalm\u00e1ns, and to have been, as a punishment, forced to give up Par\u00e1ntij, Bij\u00e1pur, and his halves of Mod\u00e1sa, B\u00e1yad, and Harsol. About the year 1766 the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r army under \u00c1ppa S\u00e1heb came to Idar and demanded from Shivsing half of the territory of Idar as belonging to his uncle R\u00e1ising who had died without male issue. Shivsing tried to avoid compliance, but was in the end compelled to write over a half share of the revenues of the state. In 1778 the Peshwa\u2019s deputy at Ahmedabad, with the help of the brother of Surajmal, one of the Idar proprietors who had been put to death by the eldest son of Shivsing, levied a tax.\n\n---\n\n1 Watson\u2019s Gujar\u00e1t, 113.\n2 Watson\u2019s Gujar\u00e1t, 120.\n3 Watson\u2019s Gujar\u00e1t, 126. According to another account (Bom. Gov. Sel. XII. 23), these districts formed part of Idar on the accession of Anandsing in 1731.\n4 Watson\u2019s Gujar\u00e1t, 126. Bom. Gov. Sel.

Gov. Rec. 91A of 1861, 75. The Idar account makes out that this cession was a free gift from the Idar chief to the Peshwa as a Brahman. But this is unlikely, and it would seem that Shivsing had helped Momin Kh\u00e1n to resist the Mar\u00e1thas. Watson\u2019s Gujar\u00e1t, 146.\n7 Bom. Gov. Rec. 91A of 1861, 26. According to another account Shivsing was obliged to pass a bond for \u00a32000 (Rs. 20,000). Ras Mala, 459.\nin the Idar districts named *ghanim ghoda vero* or the robbers' cess. Thirteen years later Shivsing died (1791) leaving five sons, Bhav\u00e1nising, Sagr\u00e1msing, Z\u00e1limsing, Amirising, and Indrasing. His eldest son Bhav\u00e1nising succeeded him, but dying after twelve days was succeeded by his son Gambhirising, then thirteen years old. Shortly after Gambhirising's accession his uncles conspired to murder him, but the plot was found out and they were ordered to leave Idar. Sagr\u00e1msing retired to Ahmednagar, and Z\u00e1limsing and Amirising for whom no provision had been made by their father took possession of the B\u00e1yad and Mod\u00e1sa sub-divisions. In 1795 the three brothers made a joint foray into the Idar districts, and Gambhirising, meeting them and being worsted, had to enter into agreements very disadvantageous to him. The brothers were allowed to keep not only the two sub-divisions they had seized, but several other tracts including D\u00e1var, Arora, Vir\u00e1v\u00e1da, Senol, G\u00e1b\u00e1t, and the S\u00e1bar K\u00e1ntha tribute. These lands were taken possession of by Z\u00e1limsing, on whose death his childless widow adopted a younger son of the Ahmednagar family.\n\nIn 1801 the Koli chiefs of Gadv\u00e1da were attacked and defeated by a Musalm\u00e1n force from P\u00e1lanpur. The chiefs applied to Gambhirising, but he was unable to give them any help. Next year the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r's revenue-collecting force came from K\u00e1thi\u00e1war, and encamping at Sidhpur, summoned Gambhirising to pay tribute arrears. Whilst at Sidhpur Gambhirising, by the promise of an increase in the tribute, induced the commander of the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r's force to help him in driving out the Musalm\u00e1ns from Gadv\u00e1da. After some difficulty the tribute was settled at the sum of \u00a32400 (Rs. 24,000), and its name changed from the robber-horse, *gh\u00e1nam ghoda*, to the grass and grain, *gh\u00e1sd\u00e1no*, cess. The Koli chiefs on their restoration to Gadv\u00e1da wrote over a third share of their revenues in Idar's favour. In 1804 the Th\u00e1kor of Ghodv\u00e1da, a Rehvar chief, was murdered by his brother. Gambhirising helped the Thakor's son to avenge his father's death, and two-fifths of the produce of Ghodv\u00e1da were written over to Idar and afterwards assigned to Indrasing. Gambhirising, in 1808, attacked Vir\u00e1har, a cadet of the Pol family; also Temba a Koli village, and the villages of Navarg\u00e1m and Berna belonging to the R\u00e1na of D\u00e1nta, from all of which he compelled the payment of tribute, *khichdi*. R\u00e1o Ratansing of Pol was also obliged to enter into a similar security. Next year Gambhirising again sallied out and collected\n\n---\n\n1 During Shivsing's reign he is said by the bards to have made grants to his followers. Mond\u00e9ti was given to M\u00e1nsing Choh\u00e1n, Ch\u00e1ndni to Champ\u00e1vat Shov\u00e1i, Mhau to Champ\u00e1vat Prat\u00e1psing, G\u00e1nthi\u00f3l to Jeth\u00e1vat Uder\u00e1niyi, Tintoi to Kump\u00e1vat Amarsing, Vadi\u00e1vi to Kump\u00e1vat B\u00e1darsing, Mer\u00e1san to Jodha Indrasing, and Bh\u00e1npur to Ud\u00e1vat L\u00e1dsing. *R\u00e1s M\u00e1l*, 456.\n\n2 These are *sicca* rupees. Deducting from them \u00a3364 (Rs. 3640) for exchange and presents, *sh\u00edrp\u00e1v*, the net tribute payable by Idar in Imperial coin was \u00a32036 (Rs. 20,360). When, in 1849, Ahmednagar and Tintoi were transferred to Idar, the tribute was raised to \u00a33034 (Rs. 30,340) the present figure, the increase of \u00a3998 (Rs. 9980) being for the transferred estates.\n\n3 *R\u00e1s M\u00e1l*, 453,484, states that, in 1808, Gambhirising attacked and laid waste Pol, driving the R\u00e1o to the hills.\ntribute from the Koli villages of Karcha, Samera, Dehg\u00e1mra, Vangar, V\u00e1nd\u00e9ol, and Khusk\u00ed, the last a Rajput possession. He subsequently spread his levies over the Rehvar estates of Sirdoi, Mohanpur, Ran\u00e1san, and Rup\u00e1l.\n\nIn 1823, Amirising of B\u00e1yad died leaving two daughters. Both Idar and Ahmednagar laid claim to his estates. In 1827 by the help of Lieutenant-Colonel Ballantyne, an agreement was framed, by which Idar renounced all claim to Mod\u00e1sa and received two-thirds of B\u00e1yad, the remaining third going to Ahmednagar. This agreement was never carried out. One of the daughters died, and in 1833 Amirising\u2019s widow wrote over the estate to Gambhirising on condition of his effecting the marriage of her surviving daughter. The terms were not fulfilled and the daughter fled to Ahmednagar, in whose favour a precisely similar document had been executed by the mother. The daughter declined matrimony and with the help of the Ahmednagar chief continued to manage her estate. Gambhirising died in the midst of these discussions (1833) and the matter dropped.\n\nA few months before his death, Gambhirising took advantage of Mr. Erskine\u2019s being at Idar to make over his son to the care of the British Government. And a few years later (1837) the continued mismanagement of the Idar state and the helpless condition of the young prince induced the R\u00e1ni to apply to the British Government to place the state under attachment. To this Government agreed and shortly after, the Mod\u00e1sa and B\u00e1yad disputes were re-opened and referred by the R\u00e1ni to Captain Outram. Meanwhile the death of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja of Jodhpur, and the adoption of Takhtsing of Ahmednagar, put a stop to any further proceedings, as the Idar house claimed as the head of the family the whole of the Ahmednagar possessions. This claim the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja of Jodhpur attempted to set aside. But it was finally decided by the Government of India on the 14th April 1848, that Ahmednagar and its dependencies should revert to the elder or Idar branch, and that the two estates should, as they had before 1784, form one state under the R\u00e1ja of Idar.\n\nOf Gambhirising\u2019s two sons Umedsing and Jav\u00e1nsing, the first died in his father\u2019s lifetime.

Dishonesty and mismanagement had reduced the revenue from \u00a310,000 to \u00a34500 (Rs. 100,000 - 45,000). About one-half of this had to be set apart to meet the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r\u2019s tribute and the rest hardly sufficed to pay the interest of a debt of \u00a330,000.

He was succeeded by his son Keshrising, the present Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja of Idar, now in his eighteenth year, during whose minority the affairs of the state are managed by the Political Agent.\n\nThe Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja of Idar, a first class chief with full civil and criminal powers over all but British subjects, receives tribute, kh\u00edchdi, amounting to a yearly sum of about \u00a31914 (Rs. 19,140) from some of the Mahi K\u00e1ntha chiefs, and pays the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r a yearly tribute, gh\u00e1sd\u00e1na, of \u00a33034 (Rs. 30,340). He holds a patent, sanad, of adoption and is entitled to a salute of fifteen guns. The military force of the state consists of fourteen field and three other guns, twelve artillery, 400 cavalry, and 500 infantry and police. The subordinate chiefs hold their estates on condition of military service, the quota being three horsemen for every \u00a3100 (Rs. 1000) of revenue. The actual force maintained amounts to about 568 cavalry and the same number of infantry. These troops are undisciplined.\n\nThe following is the genealogical tree of the Idar family:\n\n```\n\u00c1nandsing\n(1731*-1742).\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Sh\u00edvising\n    (1742-1791).\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Bhav\u00e1nising\n         (1791; died after twelve days).\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 Gambhirsing\n               (1791-1833).\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 Sagr\u00e1msing\n    (got Ahmednagar).\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 Karansing\n              (died 1835).\n            \u2514\u2500\u2500 Um\u00e9d sing\n                  (died in his father's lifetime).\n                \u2514\u2500\u2500 Jav\u00e1nsing\n                      (1833-1865).\n                    \u2514\u2500\u2500 Keshrising\n                          (1868; the present Chief).\n                        \u2514\u2500\u2500 A son\n                              (1839-1841).\n                        \u2514\u2500\u2500 Daughter.\n```\n\n```\nZ\u00e1limsing.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Pr\u00e1t\u00e1psing (adopted by the widow of Z\u00e1limsing).\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Pruthusing\n         (1835-1839).\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 Amirsing\n    (died 1823).\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 Daughter Fulji L\u00e1l.\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 Daughter Faji L\u00e1l.\n            \u2514\u2500\u2500 Takhtsing 1841;\n                  (in 1843 elected Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja of Jodhpur).\n            \u2514\u2500\u2500 Jasvatsing\n                  (present Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja of Jodhpur).\n```\n\n* This date is uncertain.

The under-lords, bhumi\u00e1s, are the early chiefs who settled in Idar at\n\n---\n\n1 In 1874 an agreement was concluded with the state for the construction of a weir in the river H\u00e1thmati and of a canal through Idar territory. By this agreement civil and criminal jurisdiction within canal limits was delegated to, and accepted by, the British Government. Aitchison's Treaties (1876), IV. 85, 87, XXXV.\n\n2 Aitchison's Treaties (1876), IV. 68.\nleast not later than the R\u00e1thod conquest (about 1250). The vassals, sard\u00e1r pat\u00e1vats, at present eight in number, and holding villages on service tenure, came as feudatory chiefs with Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja \u00c1uandsing and R\u00e1ysing from Jodhpur. In bhumia and sard\u00e1r pat\u00e1vat villages, except for sugarcane and tobacco, when a cash acre rate of from \u00a31 to \u00a31 16s. (Rs. 10-18) is levied, the crop-share, bh\u00e1gbat\u00e1i, or kaltar system prevails, the cultivator's share, bh\u00e1g, varying from a third to an eighth according to the custom of the village. In state, kh\u00e1lisa, villages, except some Bhil settlements in the north and east where the crop-share, kaltar, and plough-tax systems prevail, all the lands pay a fixed cash acre charge, bighoti, of from 2s. to \u00a31 4s. (8 annas-Rs. 6 abigha). This system was introduced about thirteen years ago by Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Sir Jav\u00e1singji. As, in most cases, the measurements were not trustworthy and the rates badly assessed, on taking charge of the state in 1868, a regular survey and assessment of rates, as in the neighbouring British districts, was introduced. In Posina and Dhunai in the north from several co-shared villages inhabited by Bhils, the state levies a house tax of 2s. 6d. (Rs. 1 \u00bc) and a grain tax of twenty pounds.\u00b9 The holders of land are of two classes, a large body of tenant proprietors and a small number of tenants-at-will. The tenant proprietor is admitted to have a right in the land, and can be ousted only for failing to pay his assessment. He has power to transfer his holding, and, in surveyed villages, can sell his occupancy right, the buyer becoming responsible for the payment of the assessment. Tenants-at-will chiefly Kolis, Bhils, and Uparv\u00e1di\u00e1s, are more or less unsettled, taking up and leaving land at their pleasure. Field tools, and, except in surveyed villages, land, are not liable to be sold for private debts.\n\nThe land revenue collection is supervised by three m\u00e1mlatddrs and two mah\u00e1lkaris. Every village is in charge of an accountant and he with the village headman, patel, collects the revenue and sends it to the Darb\u00e1r through the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r. When the revenue is paid in kind, the grain is sold in the village and after the sale has been confirmed, its money value is remitted like revenue paid in cash.\n\nFormerly civil cases were heard and decided at the Darb\u00e1r through the medium of arbitrators, a fee of one-fourth being recovered on all amounts given in the plaintiff's favour. Under the late Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja a court was established at Idar. But this did not answer and in its stead four judges, munsifs, with unlimited original powers were established in different parts of the state, an appeal lying from their decisions to the state court at Idar. Instead of the twenty-five per cent levy, a system of stamp fees was introduced. When the state came under direct management, with a view to economy the munsifs' courts were closed and in their stead th\u00e1nd\u00e1rs were given civil powers in suits up to \u00a35 (Rs. 50) and vahivatd\u00e1rs in suits up\n\n\u00b9 This grain tax is a punishment for disobedient conduct. In 1876 they refused to let their houses be counted and were so disobedient that the Assistant Political Agent had to visit their villages and levy this cess from them.\nto \u00a320 (Rs. 200) in value. All other suits were heard at Idar through the medium of arbitrators. Since 1877 a *munsif's* court with jurisdiction up to \u00a3500 (Rs. 5000) has been opened in Idar, and in the districts subject to an appeal to the Assistant Political Agent, the *m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r* has been vested with powers in cases up to \u00a325 (Rs. 250) and the *mah\u00e1lkari* up to \u00a320 (Rs. 200). These courts are conducted in accordance with the provisions of the British Civil Code and Stamp Acts.\n\nIn criminal matters the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja has powers of life and death. During the minority of the present chief the powers of a third class magistrate have been given to one of the cadets of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja's house and to five of the vassal chiefs, *sard\u00e1r pat\u00e1v\u00e1s*. The attachment clerk, *japtid\u00e1r*, at Tintoi, and the minister, *h\u00e1m\u00edd\u00e1r*, at P\u00e1l are also entrusted with petty magisterial powers. The three newly appointed *m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1rs* are invested with second class, and the two *mah\u00e1lkaris* and four joint officers with third class magisterial powers. The Assistant Political Agent has first class original powers and appellate jurisdiction in cases decided by the second and third class magistrates. During the minority of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja, the court of the Political Agent is the Sessions Court. In the conduct of these courts the British Penal and Procedure Codes are adopted as guides. On the frontier crimes, however heinous, are settled through the medium of Bhil caste committees. Crimes committed by Mah\u00ed K\u00e1ntha Bhils in Meyw\u00e1r or Sirohi, or by outside Bhils in the Mah\u00ed K\u00e1ntha are heard and disposed of at the International or Border *Panch\u00e1yats*.\n\nThe ordinary village police system is in force throughout the state. The headman is in Kanbi and Rajput villages called *mukhi*, and in Bhil villages, *g\u00e1meti*. His office is hereditary and he is generally paid in land. The village watchman, *chaukid\u00e1t*, enjoying rent-free land, is responsible for all thefts committed within his village limits. The regular police of the state, 418 strong, is distributed over forty-four posts, *th\u00e1n\u00e1s*. Each of the different under-lords and petty chiefs is responsible for the police of his own estate.\n\nThe Idar jail had in 1877 a daily average of 145 prisoners. A small garden in front is watered by prisoners working within jail limits, who are also employed in carpet making, grain grinding, and weaving country tape or coarse, *doti*, cloth; others work outside of the jail repairing roads and deepening ponds.\n\nBesides an estimated total revenue of \u00a321,178 (Rs. 2,11,780) enjoyed by the under-lords and vassals, the state revenue for 1877 was estimated at \u00a326,824 (Rs. 2,68,240), to which land revenue contributed \u00a317,154 (Rs. 1,71,540) and miscellaneous items, including transit dues \u00a33457 (Rs. 34,570) and a trade, *kas\u00e1b*, cess, \u00a31543 (Rs. 15,430), contributed \u00a39669 (Rs. 96,690). When in 1869 it came under direct management there was a state debt of \u00a314,864 (Rs. 1,48,640). Though the ordinary expenditure is \u00a321,000, between 1867 and 1877 several large items raised the debt to \u00a333,342 (Rs. 3,33,420). Since 1877 this amount has been reduced by \u00a32150 (Rs. 21,500). The state has no treasury. Its banker,\npotd\u00e1r, makes all money payments at his shop, on the authority of state orders. On all advances the banker charges interest at six per cent, and pays three per cent on all surplus funds in his keeping. A regular account of all these payments and receipts is kept at the Darb\u00e1r.\n\nInstruction.\n\nIn 1877-78, there were twenty-two schools with a monthly average attendance of thirty-seven pupils in each school. Of these, nineteen were for boys, and two at Idar and Ahmednagar for girls. The monthly average attendance at the girls' schools was fifteen at Idar and seventeen at Ahmednagar. These schools are under the supervision of the deputy educational inspector for P\u00e1lanpur and Mahi K\u00e1ntha, and are maintained from a local fund cess of one-sixteenth levied on all state, kh\u00e1lisa, lands. The state has a book depot and a reading room to which all newspapers received by the Darb\u00e1r are sent.\n\nHealth.\n\nThere is a dispensary at Idar in charge of a pensioned hospital assistant. The total of persons treated in 1877-78 was 1490, and the daily average attendance twenty-six. During the same year, under the supervision of the deputy sanitary commissioner for eastern Gujar\u00e1t, the work of vaccination was carried on by two vaccinators at a cost to the state of \u00a364 (Rs. 640). The total number of operations during the year was 4188, of which 4137 or 98 per cent were successful.\n\nPol, comprising sixty villages on the north-east frontier of the Mahi K\u00e1ntha, marches with Meyw\u00e1r in Rajput\u00e1na. The country is throughout hilly and wild. It has an area of about 27,000 acres (55,000 bigh\u00e1s) under tillage; a population of about 5000 souls, and a yearly revenue of about \u00a32000 (Rs. 20,000). The chief agricultural products are wheat, gram, and maize.\n\nJaychand, the last R\u00e1thod Rajput sovereign of Kanouj, left (1193) two sons Shivji and Sonangji. The first founded the present family of M\u00e1rw\u00e1r, and the second in 1257 established himself at Idar. For twenty-six generations the chiefs of this line bore the title of R\u00e1os of \u00cddar. The last prince Jagann\u00e1th was expelled by the Muhammadans in 1656, and retired to the hills. His son Punja is said to have re-taken Idar in 1658, and held it for six months. Idar again passed out of the hands of the family, but was a second time taken by R\u00e1o Gopin\u00e1th. At the end of five years, he was driven out, and since then the R\u00e1os have never recovered the place. Gopin\u00e1th's grandson gained Pol by putting to death the chiefs of the place, Parih\u00e1r Rajputs. Since he made it his headquarters seventeen generations have passed. Hamirsingji the present chief, about thirty-two years of age, ranks first of the second class Mahi K\u00e1ntha chiefs, and manages his own affairs living at Ghor\u00e1dar, as Pol has been found too unhealthy. The R\u00e1os of Pol pay no tribute. The family holds no deed allowing adoption; in matters of succession it follows the rule of primogeniture.\n\n1 This is the Pol account; that given in the R\u00e1s M\u00e1la (p. 345) is somewhat different.\nDa'nta, next in wealth to Idar, on the north-west frontier of the Mahi K\u00e1ntha, comprises seventy-eight villages, and marches with P\u00e1lanpur and Sirohi. The country is very hilly and wild. Its head quarters are the town of D\u00e1nta, in $24^\\circ 12'$ north latitude and $72^\\circ 50'$ east longitude, about thirty-eight miles east of Deesa and one hundred and thirty north of Baroda. Its total area is not known. The area under tillage is returned at 15,000 acres (30,000 bigh\u00e1s), the 1872 population at about 12,000 souls, and the yearly revenue at about \u00a35000 (Rs. 50,000).\n\nThe following bardic history of the D\u00e1nta family is compiled from the R\u00e1s M\u00e1la. Ravp\u00e1lji Parm\u00e1r, fortith in descent from Vikram (56 B.C.), went on a pilgrimage to Dw\u00e1rka and thence to Cutch. He took a vow never to eat or drink without having first worshipped Ambika M\u00e1ta. She, pleased with his devotion, promised him any boon he might wish. He chose the throne of Nagar Tatta and Sind, and founded three royal seats, at Nagar Tatta, Bamanuva, and Bela (809). D\u00e1moji, twelfth in descent from Ravp\u00e1lji, having no son, prayed to the M\u00e1ta, and she from the blood of her own finger raised up a prince, and ordered him to be called Jas R\u00e1j. At this time Nagar Tatta was invaded, and, after a nine years' struggle, taken by the Muhammadans, and D\u00e1moji slain. Jas R\u00e1j continuing the contest was at first successful. Afterwards the Muhammadans, returning in strength, so polluted the land that the goddess told Jas R\u00e1j that she wished to retire to \u00c1r\u00e1sur. The R\u00e1ja declaring he would follow her, was in reward promised a throne in that country. Reaching \u00c1r\u00e1sur about the middle of the eleventh century, the goddess gave him her tiger, and telling him to mount it, promised, that whatever territory he rode round, should be his. The R\u00e1ja mounted the tiger and made the circuit of seven hundred and sixty villages. On the north he included the country up to the Bharja's well in the lands of Sirohi; on the north-east up to Kot\u00e1ra; on the east as far as Derol; on the south-east as far as Gadv\u00e1da; on the south as far as Kher\u00e1lu; and on the north-west as far as Hathidura. With treasure found in the Bandh\u00e1ro hill, now called Gabbar, he raised an army, and, returning to Nagar Tatta, drove out the Muhammadans and remained in that country till his death.\n\nMeanwhile his son Ked\u00e1rsing or Keshrising stayed at Gabbargad with the M\u00e1ta. In 1069, slaying Tarsangia Bhil of Tarsanghmo, he fixed his capital there. His son, named Jasp\u00e1l or Kulp\u00e1l, while performing a great sacrifice at Rora village, failed, and the officiating Br\u00e1hman was so mortified that, cursing Jasp\u00e1l's race, he threw himself into the fire.\n\nAfter several generations Tarsanghmo was taken by Ala-ud-din Khilji (1295-1315), but was soon recovered by R\u00e1ma Jagatp\u00e1l. Sixth in descent from Jagatp\u00e1l was K\u00e1nar Dev, whose brother Amboji seized the lands of Kot\u00e1ra. K\u00e1nar Dev had two R\u00e1n\u00eds, one of whom of the Jh\u00e1la family of Halvad, built the eastern door of Kher\u00e1lu and a well and pond still known as 'the Jh\u00e1li's' well. The\n\n---\n\n1 R\u00e1s Mal\u00e1, 326, 340, 493, 478.\nsecond wife Ratan Kunvari of the Sisodia family of Udepur founded Rohilpur Pattan, now called Rora. K\u00e1nar Dev, returning from the marriage of a third wife, was treacherously attacked by his brother, and in the scuffle both were killed. R\u00e1o Bh\u00e1n of Idar (1445), hearing of the death of the two brothers, collected a force and took Tarsanghmo, and leaving a garrison there, seized M\u00e1ru R\u00e1vat whom K\u00e1nar Dev had left in charge, and carrying him to Idar, imprisoned him. Insulted by the R\u00e1o in his captivity, he swore that, if he ever got free, he would pull down the Idar palace and throw it into the Rora Harnai river. After a time he was released and went to Halvad where the two princes were. Taking them along with him, he marched to Ahmedabad and had an interview with Sult\u00e1n Muhammad II. (1441-1451) who, on condition that the brothers paid him \u00a310,000 (Rs. 1,00,000) sent an army against Idar. On the approach of the army, R\u00e1o Bh\u00e1n fled, Idar was taken, and the palace pulled down (1445). Then M\u00e1ru R\u00e1vat promised a gold mohar to every soldier who would take a stone of the palace and throw it into the Harnai. Many did so, and M\u00e1ru\u2019s threat that he would cast the palace into the river was carried out. From Idar the army marched to Tarsanghmo, and taking the place made it over to the young chief. The leader of the army demanding their pay, M\u00e1ru fled to the Sud\u00e1sna hills, but afterwards paid the troops by mortgaging the Kher\u00e1l\u00fa district.\n\nIn the time of Askaranji R\u00e1na, one of Akbar\u2019s princes having given offence, fled and was sheltered by Askaranji. He built a fortress upon the hill called K\u00e1lvan, about three miles north of Tarsanghmo. After some time the prince left for the west, where he was seized and sent to Delhi by R\u00e1o Bh\u00e1rmal of Cutch for which service he got the Morvi district. In reward for his loyalty to the prince Askaranji R\u00e1na was given by the Emperor a dress of honour and the title of Maha R\u00e1na. Askaranji left three sons, V\u00e1gh, Jaymal, and Prat\u00e1psing. R\u00e1na V\u00e1gh, hearing of the beauty of two of the Idar R\u00e1nis who had come to worship at Khedbrahma visited the temple under the guise of a Br\u00e1hman. Enraged at this insult, the R\u00e1o of Idar offered Vegarno Jam\u00e1d\u00e1r, a Br\u00e1hman convert to Isl\u00e1m, the village of Vad\u00e1li if he would seize R\u00e1na V\u00e1gh. Establishing close friendship with the R\u00e1na, Vegarno one day asked\n\n---\n\n1 During his captivity the R\u00e1o used to ridicule M\u00e1ru. One day M\u00e1ru said, \u2018R\u00e1o, you have seized the D\u00e1nta states because its chiefs are infants, but do not suppose that there is no one to help them. Even a tiger when he is caged can do nothing; but if you let me out, I will cause this palace of yours to be dug up and thrown into the Rora Harnai river.\u2019 The R\u00e1o enraged cried to the guard, \u2018Turn the dog out,\u2019 but his R\u00e1ni who knew of M\u00e1ru\u2019s exploits caused him to be detained. Another day, when the R\u00e1ni was not present, the R\u00e1o set him free. R\u00e1s M\u00e1l\u00e1, 331.\n\n2 M\u00e1ru is said to have taken the two princes, one on each hip, and with a brazier of lighted coals on his head, to have gone to make his complaint to the Sultan. When the Sultan saw him, he said, \u2018The children will be burnt, put them down.\u2019 \u2018Then, sir, the children cried out with a loud voice, \u2018when we have got down, where shall we stand?\u2019 The Idar R\u00e1o has seized our ground, and this is the king\u2019s ground; if we get down upon it, we shall make an enemy of him.\u2019 The king told them to take courage and caused them to be set down.\n\n3 This tale seems to refer to Muza\u00edfar III., the last of the Ahmedabad kings, who escaping from Delhi about 1583 remained in rebellion till his capture and death in 1591.\nhim to drink opium at the Lank ford on the S\u00e1barmati. The chief came with only two horsemen and was seized, carried to Vad\u00e1l\u00ed and thrown into prison. Vegarno wrote to the R\u00e1o, telling him of his success and asking him to confine Jaymal, the R\u00e1na\u2019s brother; but Jaymal hearing of the plot escaped, and assembling a force took possession of Tarsanghmo, and beat off an attack made by Kali\u00e1nmal. After a short time the Idar army again came against Tarsanghmo; but, defeated in a bloody battle, was forced to retreat.\n\nA third attempt was more successful, and the R\u00e1na with his family fled to D\u00e1nta, where being followed by their enemies they took shelter in the temple of the M\u00e1ta. Kali\u00e1nmal left posts at every village, and R\u00e1na Jaymal, by degrees losing all his men and horses, at last died. Though his son Jetmal succeeded in recovering several villages, Tarsanghmo lay desolate and his head-quarters were removed to D\u00e1nta (1544), called after D\u00e1ntorio Vir whose shrine lies three miles to the west on the road to Nav\u00e1v\u00e1s. R\u00e1na Jetmal was succeeded by his son Jaysing. But he failing to please some of the leading men, they recalled his brother Punja, who was in hiding in Sirohi, and made him chief, Jaysing retiring to the villages of Gangva and M\u00e1nkari. R\u00e1na Punja was a successful ruler, establishing several claims over the neighbouring lands. He left three sons, M\u00e1nsing who succeeded him, Amarsing who received the village of Sud\u00e1sna, and Dhengoji who was given Gancheru.\n\nM\u00e1nsing after ruling for four or five years died, leaving two sons Gajsing who succeeded him, and Jasvoji who at first given the village of R\u00e1npur, got Sud\u00e1sna on the death of his cousins Hathioji and Jagtoji, and afterwards obtained Vas\u00e1i and Jaspur-Chel\u00e1nu in D\u00e1nta. Gajsing was succeeded by his elder son Pruthsing (1687), while Viramdev the younger obtained the village of N\u00e1g\u00e9l. During the time of R\u00e1na Pruthsing the army of D\u00e1m\u00e1ji G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r came to D\u00e1nta, and did not withdraw till the R\u00e1n\u00e1s had agreed to pay tribute. Haidar Kuli Kh\u00e1n, Viceroy of Gujar\u00e1t (1721-22) also advanced on D\u00e1nta, but was defeated. About this time the P\u00e1lanpur chief, placing it in charge of some Bhats, ceased to pay a claim of the R\u00e1n\u00e1s on the P\u00e1lanpur village of Ghori\u00e1lya. Disregarding the Bh\u00e1ts the R\u00e1na plundered the village and seven of their number committed suicide. This, it was said, was the reason why all the R\u00e1na\u2019s seven sons died before him.\n\n---\n\n1 It is said that the R\u00e1o was turning back when he saw a Kanbi woman going along with her husband\u2019s dinner. The R\u00e1o asked what she had, and on being told it was rice pottage he took it and began to eat, but as it was hot his fingers were burnt. The woman said, \u2018Why, you are as bad as Kali\u00e1nmal.\u2019 The R\u00e1o asked how that was. She said, \u2018The R\u00e1o instead of taking the outlying villages, tries to take Tarsanghmo itself, a thing which he cannot do in ten years. So you, instead of beginning round the edges, must needs thrust your fingers into the middle and get them burnt.\u2019\n\n2 On the monument of R\u00e1na Gajsing at D\u00e1nta is the following inscription: In the year 1743 (A.D. 1687) on M\u00e1rgshirsh sud 9th, Sunday, three sat\u00eds burned; their names, Vahuj\u00ed Shri * * * Anand Kunvar; Vahuj\u00ed Shri V\u00e1gheli Rup\u00e1ll\u00ed, Anand Kunvar; Vahuj\u00ed Shri Bhatiyani Jesalm\u00e9ri, Anop Kunvar; these three became sat\u00eds. In commemoration of them this chhatri of R\u00e1na Shri Gajsingji was caused to be made. In the year 1748 (A.D. 1692) on M\u00e1gh vad 7th, on Friday the chhatri was caused to be made.\n\n3 There is an open funeral pavilion at D\u00e1nta which contains three pal\u00e1\u00eds. The centre one below the usual sun and moon bears the figure of a horseman; the two\nKaranji his nephew who succeeded him, quarrelling with Meghr\u00e1j, one of his chief men, was attacked and forced to fly before the joint strength of Meghr\u00e1j and the Th\u00e1k\u00f3r of Sud\u00e1sna. Two years later, by the help of the Diw\u00e1n of P\u00e1lanpur, Karanji was reinstated. Karanji was succeeded by his son Ratansing and he, after ruling for five years, by his brother Abhayasing. Finding his chief men and vassals troublesome, Abhayasing promised a fourth share of the D\u00e1nta revenues to a Mar\u00e1tha named Arjunr\u00e1v Choparo. He, with a hundred Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r horse, after about two years began to build a small fort at D\u00e1nta. At last his conduct became so oppressive, that, with the help of the people, M\u00e1nsing, the R\u00e1na\u2019s eldest son, drove him out. Shortly after, R\u00e1na Abhayasing died (1795) and was succeeded by his son M\u00e1nsing, who acted with vigour and increased the power of the state. Dying in 1800 he was succeeded by his brother Jagatsing, who was also a vigorous ruler, chastising Bhil cattle stealers, and spreading his demands over several villages. Afterwards he fell into trouble with Vakhtoji Jitoji one of his vassals, but by the help of the Diw\u00e1n of P\u00e1lanpur the dispute was quietly settled.\n\nIn a second dispute between the R\u00e1na and one of his vassals, the R\u00e1na agreed, on condition that the Diw\u00e1n of P\u00e1lanpur helped him to keep order, to make over to him nearly a one-half share of the D\u00e1nta territory. This agreement continued till 1848 when, on condition of a yearly payment of \u00a350 (Rs. 500), it was cancelled. As Jagatsing had no son he proposed to adopt a son of Narsing his brother. But Narsing refused, saying that he would not do obeisance at his own son\u2019s feet. After this Jagatsing suspected that Narsing had designs on his life and fled from his capital. He was persuaded to come back, but soon after, in 1823, died of fever. Narsing, who succeeded him, ruled till 1847 when he was succeeded by his son Jh\u00e1lamsing, and he in 1860 by Harisingji, and he in December 1876 by the present chief Jasvatsingji.\n\nThe R\u00e1na of D\u00e1nta, ranking in the second class, enjoys special influence from having in his territory the famous shrine of Amba Bhav\u00e1ni, where in August, September, October, and November, pilgrims of all ranks meet, their costly offerings coming in the end into the R\u00e1na\u2019s exchequer. He is a tributary chief, paying the Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r, as gh\u00e1sd\u00e1na, a yearly sum of \u00a3237 2s. 2\u00bdd. (Rs. 2371-1-11); the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja of Idar, \u00a351 7s. 10\u00bdd. (Rs. 513-15-3) as kh\u00edch\u00e1di; and the Diwan of P\u00e1lanpur \u00a350 (Rs. 500). The family holds no deed allowing adoption; in matters of succession it follows the rule of primogeniture.\n\nside stones have figures of satis sculptured upon them. \u2018R\u00e1na Shri Karanji,\u2019 as an inscription records, \u2018made the chhati of R\u00e1na Shri Pr\u00e1thasing.\u2019 Another inscription runs: \u2018Praise to Shri Ganesh!\u2019 When R\u00e1na Shri Pr\u00e1thasingji departed to Shri Vaikunth, two satis burned; their names are Vahuji Shri Devri, Phul Kunvar, and Vahuji Shri V\u00e1gheli Peth\u00e1puri, Sard\u00e1r Kunvar, in Samvat1799 (A.D. 1743) on Shradhvan sud 2nd on Wednesday.\n\n1 A 1/3rd share was written over to P\u00e1lanpur of which D\u00e1nta practically became a feudatory. Aitchison\u2019s Treaties, IV. 56.\n2 Aitchison\u2019s Treaties, IV. 43. The bards\u2019 accounts wrongly state that the land was made over to the British. (R\u00e1s M\u00e1l\u00e1, 474). The explanation probably is that P\u00e1lanpur was then to a great extent under British management.\nMalpur, in the district of Nani Marwar in the south-east of the Mahi Kantha, comprises seventy-seven villages, many of them alienated, and marches with Lunavada and Ahmedabad. Hilly and wild its exact extent is not known; its area under tillage is estimated at about 41,000 acres (81,695 bighas); its population at about 10,000 souls; and its yearly revenue at about \u00a31200 (Rs. 12,000).\n\nThe Malpur Raval, ranking first of the third class of Mahi Kantha chiefs, are Rathod Rajputs, an offshoot from the family of the Raos of Idar. Virajput, a younger son of Kiratsingji seventh Rao of Idar, was provided with a grant of land, and in 1344 his grandson Khanadji established himself at Man and his grandson Randhirisingji moved from Man to Modasa. It was not till 1466 that Raval Vaghisingji, the great grandson of Randhirisingji of Modasa, and eighth in descent from Virajmal, settled at Malpur. At that time Malpur was ruled by a Bhil chief named Malo Kant. A Brahman of Malpur had a beautiful daughter whom Malo Kant wished to marry. After trying every means in his power to dissuade Malo Kant the Brahman fled to Modasa and begged the assistance of the ruling chief Vaghisingji, who shortly after attacked and conquered Malpur, where his descendants have since ruled as Ravals. In 1780 during the reign of Indrasingji, Fatehsing Gaikwar attacked and captured Malpur and took away its gates, and since then the Ravals of Malpur have paid the Gaikwar a yearly tribute, ghadsana. In 1796 Jalamsing of Modasa attacked Malpur and killed the ruling Raval whose name was also Jalamsing. Nor was his son Takhtsing allowed to succeed till he had given up one-half of the Modasa tribute, choth, and consented to commute the other half for a money payment under the head of gurds. In 1816, during the reign of Raval Takhtsing, the Maharaja of Idar stayed at Malpur, and since then the Ravals have paid Idar a tribute, khichdi. The present Raval Shivisingji is about thirty-eight years old. He reckons twenty-two generations from Kiratsingji, the seventh Rao of Idar. His seat is at Malpur the principal town of the state. He is a tributary chief paying the Gaikwar as ghadsana a yearly sum of \u00a328 6\u00bdd. (Rs. 280-4-4); the Maharaja of Idar, \u00a339 11s. 5\u00bdd. (Rs. 395-11-8) as khichdi; and the British Government \u00a343 5\u00bdd. (Rs. 430-3-5) as salami. The family holds no deed allowing adoption; in matters of succession it follows the rule of primogeniture.\n\nMansa, twelve villages in the Sabar Kantha district, is surrounded by Gaikwar territory. Its area under tillage is estimated at 11,000 acres (22,000 bighas); its population at about 12,000 souls; and its yearly revenue at about \u00a33900 (Rs. 39,000).\n\nThe chief of Mansa, ranking in the third class, is descended from the Chavda dynasty of Anhilvada Patan (746-942). At what time he gained his present possessions is not known. The ruling Thakor, Rajisingji, about twenty-nine years of age, himself manages his estate. His seat is at Mansa the chief town of the state. He is a tributary chief, paying the Gaikwar as ghadsana a yearly sum of \u00a31173 8s. (Rs. 11,734). The family holds no deed allowing\nadoption; in matters of succession it follows the rule of primogeniture.\n\nMohanpur, fifty-eight villages, in the Rehvar district, has an estimated area of 22,400 acres (44,800 bigh\u00e1s) under tillage; a population of 14,000 souls; and a yearly revenue of about \u00a32700 (Rs. 27,000).\n\nThe Th\u00e1kor of Mohanpur, taking rank in the third class, is a Rehvar Rajput of the Indra race, and is descended from the R\u00e1os of Chandr\u00e1vati, near mount \u00c1bu. His ancestor Jasp\u00e1l emigrated from Chandr\u00e1vati to Hadol in the Mahi K\u00e1ntha in 1227, and thence in the thirteenth generation Th\u00e1kor Pruthur\u00e1j moved to Ghodv\u00e1da, having received a grant of that and the neighbouring districts, which in course of time were divided among the different branches of the family. The present Th\u00e1kor, Umedsing, about twenty-six years of age, himself manages his estate. His seat is at Mohanpur, the chief town in the state. He is a tributary chief, paying the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r, as gh\u00e1sd\u00e1na, a yearly sum of \u00a3474 19s. 4\u00bdd. (Rs. 4749-11-2); the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja of Idar, \u00a3224 19s. 2\u00bdd. (Rs. 2249-9-6) as kh\u00edchdi; and the British Government, 15s. (Rs. 7\u00bd) as sal\u00e1mi. The family holds no deed allowing adoption; in matters of succession it follows the rule of primogeniture.\n\nGhoda'sar, on the south frontier of the Mahi K\u00e1ntha, with in all fifteen villages, marches with the British district of Kaira. It has an area of 22,500 acres (45,000 bigh\u00e1s) under tillage; a population of 8273 souls; and a yearly revenue of about \u00a32500 (Rs. 25,000).\n\nThe Th\u00e1kors of Ghod\u00e1sar, ranking in the fourth class, are said to have been originally Rajputs, who by marrying Koli women became known as D\u00e1bhi Kol\u00eds. They are said to have come to Gujar\u00e1t from Bundelkhand. One of them, named Vejalji, was taken into the service of one of the later Hindu R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Anhilv\u00e1da P\u00e9tan and received the district of Dongarva in grant, j\u00e1ghir. The family was reduced by Sult\u00e1n Ahmad I. (1411 - 1443), but on submission, My\u00e1ji, an ancestor of the present chief, was sent to the neighbourhood of the present seat, and having defeated a tribe of rebel Rajputs, was allowed to enjoy their estates of 125 villages, his head-quarters being Barkunda. For this act of violence the family acquired the cognomen of 'kh\u00e1nt'. Since then, except for some property cesses, gir\u00e1s haks, the family has lost nearly all their villages. Ghod\u00e1sar, the principal place, is the seat of the Th\u00e1kor. The present Th\u00e1kor Surajmal, about twenty-nine years of age, himself manages the affairs\n\n---\n\n1 Of the origin of the Rehvar Pat\u00e1uts the following account is given. The Rehvar Rajputs are P\u00e1rm\u00e1rs and came originally from Ujain. They have since changed their place of abode successively to P\u00e1rkar, the Abu mountain, and lastly to T\u00e1r\u00ednga, from all of which places they seem to have been expelled. They took possession of T\u00e1r\u00ednga in Samvat 1282 (1226 A.D.). Their deeds, pat\u00e1s, are derived from the former R\u00e1os of Idar, and their dependence on the present R\u00e1ja is limited to the payment of kh\u00edchdi. The name Rehvar is said to be derived from the following circumstance: one of their great ancestors at Abu being on his way to take charge of his bride, stopped to pay his devotions at a temple of the Devi. As his future father-in-law intended to kill him, the goddess from compassion, is reported to have said reh var, i.e. bridegroom, go no further. He remained and those who went were all murdered. Bom.

They claim descent from the Jh\u00e1la Rajputs of Halvad in K\u00e1thi\u00e1war. Their ancestor, Harising of the Mundra house, in 1483 entered the service of Sult\u00e1n Mahmud Begada and became a Mus\u00e1l\u00e1n. For this and his services Harising received a grant of M\u00e1ndva and its dependent villages, which he helped to wrest from S\u00e1msing, a Rajput chief of the Bevla tribe, and from him have sprung the petty states of Pun\u00e1dra, Khad\u00e1l, D\u00e1bha, and Ram\u00e1s in the Mahi K\u00e1ntha, M\u00e1ndva itself being under the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r. The Mi\u00e1s of Pun\u00e1dra follow a mixed Muhammadan and Hindu religion, giving their daughters in marriage to Muhammadans of rank and marrying the daughters of Koli chiefs. They bury their dead.

Siramshi or S\u00e1rangdev, one of the two sons of R\u00e1ja Karan, the last R\u00e1ja of P\u00e1tan, was allowed the town of K\u00e1lol and surrounding villages as an estate. Descended from him in the tenth generation was Hemt\u00e1ji, who, in 1445, slaying his maternal uncle Pit\u00e1ji of the Gohil tribe, took possession of his estate called after him Peth\u0101pur.

From him are sprung the families of Ilol, Dedol, Kherv\u00e1da, Vaktapur, Dedhrota, and Prempur. The date is not known, but as the Makv\u00e1na is a branch of the Jh\u00e1la tribe, it is probable that the settlement of these chiefs and those of Khad\u00e1l and Pun\u00e1dra took place in the fourteenth century, when the Jh\u00e1l\u00e1s were driven by the K\u00e1th\u00eds out of H\u00e1l\u00e1r in K\u00e1thi\u00e1war. The present Th\u00e1kor, Vakhtsing, a minor about seventeen years of age, succeeded in 1866, and is receiving his education at the R\u00e1jkum\u00e1r College in K\u00e1thi\u00e1war. His seat is at Ilol the chief town of the state. He is a tributary chief paying the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r a yearly sum of \u00a3186 6s. 4\u00bdd. (Rs. 1863-3-1); and the Mah\u00e1raja of Idar \u00a342 16s. 7\u00bdd. (Rs. 428-5-1) as kh\u00e1ch\u00e1di, and \u00a31 13s. 6\u00bdd. (Rs. 16-12-2) as Ahmednagar sal\u00e1mi hak. The family holds no deed allowing adoption; in matters of succession it follows the rule of primogeniture. During the chief's minority his state is managed by the Political Agent.\n\nKat\u00f3san, twenty-nine villages, isolated in Bhuv\u00e1l, north of the Virang\u00e1m sub-division of the Ahmedabad district, has an area of 7797 acres (15,595 bigh\u00e1s) under tillage; a population of 4550 souls; and a yearly revenue of about \u00a32500 (Rs. 25,000).\n\nThe Th\u00e1kors, Makv\u00e1na Kolis of the Chandra race, are the descendants of Sh\u00e1mt\u00e1ji, the third son of Kesar the Makv\u00e1na, who was the son of Vehi\u00e1s of the Jh\u00e1la tribe, which sprung from the Anhilv\u00e1da dynasty. Sh\u00e1mt\u00e1ji took forcible possession of the town of S\u00e1nthal, and there, in the days of Mahmud Begada (1459 - 1513), his descendant K\u00e1noji lived. By marrying the daughter of a Bhil chieftain, K\u00e1noji lost caste. But serving with distinction under Sult\u00e1n Mahmud he received a grant of the Kat\u00f3san state with eighty-four villages. From this Kanoji is descended the present chief, Th\u00e1kor Karansing, who, ranking as a fourth class chief, from family sub-divisions enjoys but a small portion of the original estate. Th\u00e1kor Karansing, about thirty-one years of age, succeeded in 1869. His seat is at Kat\u00f3san, the chief town of the state. He is a tributary chief, paying the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r as gh\u00e1sd\u00e1na a yearly sum of \u00a354 8s. 5\u00bdd. (Rs. 544-3-10). The family holds no deed allowing adoption; in matters of succession it does not follow the rule of primogeniture.\nMagodi, with thirty villages in the N\u00e1ni M\u00e1rv\u00e1r district, has an area of 12,362 acres (24,725 bigh\u00e1s) under tillage; a population of about 3000 souls, and a yearly revenue of about \u00a3400 (Rs. 4000).\n\nThe Th\u00e1kors of Magodi, R\u00e1thod Rajputs, belong to a younger branch of the M\u00e1lpur family and rank in the fifth class of Mahi K\u00e1ntha chiefs. They trace their descent from R\u00e1msingji, second son of Govindsingji, second R\u00e1val of M\u00e1lpur, who obtained the Magodi estate as a maintenance about the year 1537, when his elder brother Panchsingji, third R\u00e1val of M\u00e1lpur, succeeded to the M\u00e1lpur chieftainship. Himatsing, the present Th\u00e1kor, about forty-eight years of age, has his seat at Magodi, the chief town of the state. He is a tributary chief, paying the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja of Idar as khichdi a yearly sum of \u00a39 6s. 2\u00bdd. (Rs. 93-1-10). The family holds no deed allowing adoption; in matters of succession it follows the rule of primogeniture.\n\nSud\u00e1sna, in the N\u00e1ni M\u00e1rv\u00e1r district, marching on the west with P\u00e1lanpur and comprising nineteen villages, has an area of 5000 acres (10,000 bigh\u00e1s) under tillage; a population of 5365 souls, and a yearly revenue of \u00a3800 (Rs. 8000).\n\nThe Th\u00e1kors of Sud\u00e1sna, B\u00e1rad Rajputs of the Parm\u00e1r tribe, ranking in the fifth class, trace their descent from Amarsing the son of Punja brother of M\u00e1nsing of D\u00e1nta. In the latter half of the seventeenth century, in Amarsing\u2019s time, the estate consisted of the single village of Sud\u00e1sna. Amarsing made frequent forays on his cousin Jasvoji\u2019s estate of R\u00e1npur. In revenge M\u00e1nsing of D\u00e1nta, a friend of Jasvoji, hired a body of freebooters, who shortly afterwards meeting Amarsing near the village of Palkhari fell on him and put him to death. Amarsing was succeeded by his son Hathioji, and he by Khom\u00e1nsing, a child of eighteen months old. Taking advantage of this minority Jasvoji of R\u00e1npur took Sud\u00e1sna, giving Hathioji\u2019s widow the village of Uderan. About this time the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r army under Vithoba attacked Sud\u00e1sna, plundered the village and retired. After this they returned every three or four years, and at last levied a fixed tribute. Sard\u00e1rsing, Jasvoji\u2019s son and successor, was adopted by Ga\u00edsing of D\u00e1nta. Afterwards an heir was born to Ga\u00edsing and Sard\u00e1rsing\u2019s claims were met by the grant of V\u00e1s\u00e1i, D\u00e1vol, D\u00e1lisanu, and several other villages. Amarsing, Sard\u00e1rsing\u2019s grandson and successor, greatly increased the estate and took the Khilar district between Sud\u00e1sna and T\u00e1ringa. He repulsed a G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r army; and defeating the D\u00e1nta chief received from him five villages and a fourth share of the transit dues paid by pilgrims to the shrine of Amba Bhav\u00e1ni. Amarsing left a son Fatehsing, whose sons were Mohbatsing and Punji. In the time of Mohbatsing, in 1804, K\u00e1k\u00e1ji, a Mar\u00e1tha officer, brought an army of the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r against Sud\u00e1sna, but was beaten by the Th\u00e1kor, who is said to have been helped by the spirit of M\u00e1nikn\u00e1th.\n\n---\n\n1 R\u00e1s M\u00e1la, 479.\n2 In this village her descendants still (1856) remain. R\u00e1s M\u00e1la, 479.\n3 This village on Sard\u00e1rsing\u2019s death was held jointly by his four sons. R\u00e1s M\u00e1la, 480.\nB\u00e1vo,\u00b9 and did not lose a man. Mohbatsing left four sons, Harising, Ratansing, Parbatsing, and Mokansing. Harising enjoyed the chiefship for four years, and was succeeded by Ratansing who held it for two years and died. His son Bhupatsing succeeded him, and lived only for one year. Then (1845) Parbatsing the present Th\u00e1kor, now about sixty years of age, began to rule. His seat is at Sud\u00e1sna, the chief town of the state. He is a tributary chief, paying the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r a yearly sum of about \u00a3100 (Rs. 1000) as gh\u00e1sd\u00e1na, and the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja of Idar \u00a336 2s. 6\u00bdd. (Rs. 361-4-2) as khichdi. The family holds no deed allowing adoption; in matters of succession it follows the rule of primogeniture.\n\nVala'sna, with ten villages on the S\u00e1barmati in the N\u00e1ni M\u00e1rv\u00e1r district, has an area of 3800 acres (7600 bigh\u00e1s) under tillage; a population of 3880 souls; and a yearly revenue of about \u00a3600 (Rs. 6000).\n\nThe Th\u00e1kors of Val\u00e1sna, ranking in the fifth class, are R\u00e1thod Rajputs, and trace their origin to Viramdev, the famous R\u00e1o of Idar, a contemporary of Akbar, who ruled about the beginning of the seventeenth century. Viramdev dying childless, was unlawfully succeeded by his younger nephew Kali\u00e1nmal. Gop\u00e1ld\u00e1s the elder brother to obtain his rights took service with the Emperor of Delhi. Before leaving for Delhi, Gop\u00e1ld\u00e1s left his family with a cowherd named Volo. He returned with a force from Delhi; but on his way to Idar, was waylaid and killed by L\u00e1l Mia,\u00b2 the Kasb\u00e1t\u00ed of M\u00e1ndva whose town he had taken. After his death Gop\u00e1ld\u00e1s' family remained with the cowherd Volo, and founded a village naming it Val\u00e1sna in honour of their protector. Gradually encroaching on the country round, Harising and Ajabsing, Gop\u00e1ld\u00e1s' two sons, divided their lands into the greater and lesser estates of Val\u00e1sna. These lands are not now the sole property of their descendants, as the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja of Idar acquired a share in part of the state. M\u00e1nisgji, the present Th\u00e1kor, about thirty years of age, has his seat at Val\u00e1sna the chief town of the state. He is a tributary chief paying the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r as gh\u00e1sd\u00e1na a yearly sum of \u00a328 6\u00bdd. (Rs. 280-4-4).

Driven from P\u00e1tri they took refuge with the R\u00e1ja of Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner, who gave them a grant, j\u00e1ghir, of B\u00e1riya. From B\u00e1riya one of the family, in the time of Mahmud Begada, got possession of S\u00e1thamba. The seat of\n\n\u00b9 This M\u00e1nikn\u00e1th is the same B\u00e1vo whose leave had to be gained before the walls of Ahmedabad could be built (Bombay Gazetteer, IV. 276, note 3), and who has two shrines at Tarsanghmo and Sud\u00e1sna where he used to live.\n\n\u00b2 This L\u00e1l Mia was probably the ancestor of the M\u00e1ndva Mia and progenitor of Pun\u00e1dra, Khad\u00e1l, and other Mi\u00e1s.

Vah\u00e1ji afterwards asked for a further grant and was, in 1674, presented with Dadh\u00e1liya and six other Bhil villages. About fifty years later (1731), when the Jodhpur princes R\u00e1ising and \u00c1nand-sing assumed the government of Idar, the Dadh\u00e1liya chief refused to serve under them, and the B\u00e1yad estate was taken from him.

(1411 - 1443) to keep the R\u0101os of Idar in check. The king is said to have been so fond of the place that he thought of making it, instead of Ahmedabad, the capital of Gujar\u00e1t. When the present dynasty took Idar (1728), Ahmednagar soon fell into their hands. After the death of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Shivsing, in 1792, his brother Sagr\u0101msing took Ahmednagar and the country round, and, in spite of the efforts of his nephew Gambhirsing, became an independent chief. Sagr\u0101msing was succeeded by his son Karansing. The latter died in 1835, and Mr. Erskine, the British Agent, who was in the neighbourhood with a force, moved to Ahmednagar to prevent the R\u0101nis from becoming satis. The sons of the deceased Mah\u0101r\u0101ja begged Mr. Erskine not to interfere with their customs. Finding him resolved to prevent the sacrifice, while pretending to negotiate, they secretly summoned the Bhils and other turbulent tribes, and in the night, opening a way through the fort wall to the river bed, burnt the R\u0101nis with their deceased husband. The sons of the deceased Mah\u0101r\u0101ja fled, but subsequently gave themselves up, and, after entering into an engagement with the British Government, Takhtsing was allowed to succeed his father as Mah\u0101r\u0101ja of Ahmednagar. Some years later he was chosen to fill the vacant throne of Jodhpur. He tried to keep Ahmednagar and its dependencies, but, after a long discussion, it was, in 1848, ruled that Ahmednagar should revert to Idar.\n\nRemains.\n\nThe white sandstone and cement walls of the original fort, though much ruined in parts, still surround the town. The gateways, especially the Parantij or Ahmedabad gate, are handsome specimens of Musalm\u00e1n architecture. The fortifications show that the builders trusted that artillery would never be brought against the fort. The bastions are hollow, the inside occupied by pillared rooms in two stories which take up so much space that the walls of the bastions are composed of single layers of stone. In the town, a small stone building, with richly carved bow windows, was once the residence of the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u00e1s of Ahmednagar. There are also some interesting Jain temples. Further on is a very handsome well, known as the K\u0101z\u012b's V\u0101rdi, with inscriptions on the side walls, one in Arabic and the other in Devnagri, bearing respectively the dates 1417 (820 H.) and 1522 (S. 1578). The second inscription shows that the\nwell was built in 1522 by Shamsher-ul-Mulk, who is stated by tradition to have been a son of Sult\u00e1n Ahmad. Further on, the citadel or inner fort, known like that in Ahmedabad as the Bhadar, contains some very fine though ruinous buildings, the principal being that traditionally known as the Mulla or Mohina R\u00e1ni's palace. The windows of these buildings are very fine, of stone carved with the delicacy of lace. There are several wells hewn out of the solid rock, and, though dry, in good preservation. In 1858, the principal building in the Bhadar was occupied as a mess-house by a small force sent to keep order in the Mahi K\u00e1ntha during the troubled times of the Mutinies. It has since become a ruin. Outside, at some distance from the Bhadar and opening directly on the H\u00e1thmati, is the Idar gate. Close to it is a small mosque in perfect preservation, its windows worthy of notice, being each ornamented outside with a carved stone canopy, while the frame is filled with carved stone work representing trees with foliage, through the interstices of which, a tempered light streams into the building. This mosque is said to have been built by Nasar-ul-Mulk, the eldest son of Sult\u00e1n Ahmad. East of this mosque is the Nine-l\u00e1kh Reservoir, kund, one of the most interesting objects in Ahmednagar. It is easy to pass it without notice, as from a little distance nothing is seen but an oblong hollow or pit about 100 feet broad and 500 long. At the foot of the flight of steps, which form one of the sides of the pit, is a stone basin, filled with water from a perennial spring and with stone cloisters round three of its sides. At the back of the west cloister is a ladies' gallery hidden from sight by carved open stone screens. On the south side is a building with a stone canopy intended for the king or chief man of the place, who during the heat of the day came with his ladies to enjoy this cool retreat. The cloister on the north has disappeared, but the others, in fair preservation, are fine specimens of architecture. Tradition ascribes the work to T\u00e1j-ul-Mulk, another of the sons of Sult\u00e1n Ahmad.\n\nClose to this place are the remains of buildings said to have been stables or cavalry lines. At one side of these, large arched doorways, now built up, led to an out-work facing the north, and immediately over the river, which was evidently at one time covered with a pillared roof. This was probably a favourite place of resort, being cool, except at noon-day, and commanding a fine view of the Idar hills. Not far from the stables, a handsome gateway opens on the road to the river. On the other side of the road three domed and pillared cupolas, chhatris, mark the spots where the remains of the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1s of Ahmednagar were burnt. Close to these are the H\u00e1thmati canal and the weir across the river, with a fine sheet of water above it. A bridge has been planned over the weir to\n\n---\n\n1 Bhadr, that is propitious a title of K\u00e1li, is the name of the P\u00e1tan citadel from which the Ahmedabad citadel was named. Bombay Gazetteer, IV. 250, 275.\n2 This gate received its name after R\u00e1o Viramdev of Idar had taken Ahmednagar. R\u00e1o M\u00e1l\u00e1, 309.\n3 According to another account it is said to have been constructed during the reign of Ahmad Sh\u00e1h as a bathing place for Mohina R\u00e1ni, who, it is said, used to visit it daily by an underground passage from the Bhadar palace.\n4 This weir is of rubble masonry 22 feet high and 1000 feet long, founded partly on sandstone and partly on inferior limestone. Bombay Gazetteer, IV. 50.\nwhich the Idar state is to contribute \u00a35300 (Rs. 53,000), but it is not likely that this work will be soon taken in hand.\n\nIn 1872, the population of Ahmednagar was returned at 4461 souls. With so scanty a population, much of the land within the walls is waste or used for tillage. Bohoras, numbering 1571 souls, are an important class dealing with the Bhils, from whom they buy gum, honey, and other forest produce. There are a good number of stone-cutters as the Ahmednagar sandstone is still in great demand. One of the quarries is within the fort walls, another and a better one is on the bank of the Hathmati. Besides for its stone, Ahmednagar has a high local name for swords, matchlocks, and knives. When the weir across the river was being built, the road from the town to the river was found so heavy and sandy that the stone-laden carts could scarcely pass. To meet this difficulty, a tramway of flat stone slabs was sunk in two parallel lines for the cart wheels to run on. So useful has this been found, that it has been continued to parts of the Parantij road, on the other side of the town.\n\nAmliya'ra, in the Vatrak Kanta, has a temple of Nilkanth Mahadev, an old Musalm\u00e1n tomb, and the ruins of an old town.\n\nAmba Bhava'ni, a celebrated shrine and place of pilgrimage, lies near the source of the river Sarasvati, in the Arasur hills at the south-west end of the Aravali range, on the north frontier of Mahi Kanta, about fifteen miles north of the state of Danta. Its origin is lost in antiquity. Probably 'Mother Amba' was one of the deities of the pre-Hindu race, whom the Hindu conquerors absorbed into their pantheon, and finally identified with the goddess Bhavani. The shrine seems to have been as celebrated in the days of Valabhi (746) as it is now. For tradition tells, that when that famous city fell, King Shiladitya's wife Pushpavati was on a pilgrimage to Amba Bhavani. Here at a still earlier date the hair of the infant Krishna was offered, and here in after-days Krishna's bride Rukmini worshipped the goddess, when he bore her from the threatened embraces of Shishupal. The road to the shrine lies through valleys and over forest-clad hills. The stream of votaries never quite ceases, but thrice a year, from all sides, great trains of pilgrims, sanghs, make their way to the shrine. The great pilgrimage time is Bhadarva (September), the goddess' birth-month. On the eighth night of the navratra the Rana of Danta attends the worship, fans the goddess with a horse-hair fly-flapper, celebrates the fire sacrifice, and fills with sweetmeats a huge cauldron, which, on the fall of the garland from the goddess' neck, the Bhils empty. Among the offerings to the goddess are animal sacrifices and spirituous liquors. In a walled enclosure partly filled with dwellings for temple servants and rest-houses, stands the temple,\n\n---\n\n1 Temples to Amba are found in many parts of India. There is a famous one at Kolhapur and another at Udepur.\n2 Ras Mala, 234.\n3 Ras Mala, 323.\n4 According to another account it is visited four times, in Kartik, Maghar, Shravan, and Bhadarva.\na small building of coarse marble, twenty feet long by twenty broad, and nineteen high. The floor is of marble, and inside is the image of the goddess, a block of stone roughly hewn into the semblance of a human figure. The builders are said to have been N\u00e1gar Br\u00e1hmans but its date is not known. Some of the pillars have writings, chiefly of the sixteenth century, recording private gifts. One, dated 1723, states that during the reign of R\u00e1jadhir\u00e1j R\u00e1n\u00e1ji, Shri Pruthusingji, whose name is 108 times repeated, a V\u00e1ni built a rest-house for the sake of a son. It adds \u2018by the kindness of Amba the hope was fulfilled.\u2019 A reservoir near, called the M\u00e1nasarovar of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1na Shrimaldev, bears the date 1545 and the name of the R\u00e1ni of R\u00e1o Bhr\u00e1mal. The office of officiating priest is farmed out to certain Audich Br\u00e1hmans of Sidhpur. The R\u00e1na of D\u00e1nta, as custodian of the temple, receives all the offerings as well as fees from pilgrims who have to show a pass before entering the shrine.\u00b9 The R\u00e1os of Sirohi, who formerly held a share in the temple revenues, have given it up on the ground that none but members of religious orders can, with propriety, share in the offerings of a temple. Four miles north-east of Amba Bhav\u00e1ni is the temple of Koteshvar Mah\u00e1dev twenty feet long by fifteen broad and twenty-five high. Attached to it is a partly ruined rest-house. Pilgrims who attend the Amba Bhav\u00e1ni shrine must visit this temple also and bathe in the source of the Sarasvati whose waters are of very great purifying power.\n\nBha'vn'ath, about fifteen miles to the east of Idar, famous as a resting place of the seer Bhrigu, has an ancient pond on whose banks stands an old temple dedicated to Bh\u00e1vn\u00e1th Mah\u00e1dev. The earth\u00b2 and water of this pond have so great a name for curing leprosy that many people suffering from that disease come from all parts of Gujar\u00e1t. Under the direction of the temple devotees, the patients bathe in the water, and, covering their bodies with the earth, allow it to remain from three to four hours. From forty to fifty per cent are said to be cured.\n\nBhiloda, in the Idar state, fifteen miles south-east of the capital, has a temple of Shri Chandra Prabhuji, measuring seventy feet long by forty-five broad and thirty high, built of sandstone covered with stucco. It has a tower of four stories, seventy-five feet high, and a rest-house within the entrance gate. It has lately been put in repair by a Jain merchant.\n\nDesan, in Idar, has a partly ruined temple of Bh\u00e1vn\u00e1th Mah\u00e1dev, also known by the name of the seer Chuman Rishi. Upwards of 400 years old and measuring fifty feet by twenty-five and thirty-six\n\n\u00b9 The Th\u00e1kor of Sud\u00e1sna, the descendant of a former R\u00e1na of D\u00e1nta, has a share in the pilgrim fees which he is entitled to levy direct.\n\n\u00b2 A sample of this earth, very heavy and of a light ash colour, was in July 1878 sent by the Assistant Political Agent through the apothecary in charge of the S\u00e1dra Civil Hospital to the Chemical Analyser to Government. Examination failed to show any unusual constituents in the earth. The details were, sand 9\u00b797, silica 7\u00b745, oxide of iron and alumina 3\u00b786, carbonate of magnesia 1\u00b733, carbonate of lime 75\u00b738, sulphate of lime 0\u00b772, and water, alkali, and loss 1\u00b724.\nhigh, it is built of white sandstone and brick, and has a rest-house attached. A yearly fair is held here in the month of Shravan (August).\n\n**Haldarvas**, in the Ghod\u00e1sar sub-division in the south of Mahi K\u00e1ntha, has M\u00e1vji Pir, a plain building with a Musalm\u00e1n grave put in repair forty years ago by one Bh\u00e1ji Muhammad. Half-way between Haldarvas and the village of Barm\u00e1ra, is the Bamnoli kot, a ruined fort on the right bank of the V\u00e1trak, said to have been built by Mahmud Begada (1459-1511). On the bank of the river V\u00e1trak, half a mile south-east of the village of Haldarvas, is a temple of Mah\u00e1dev named after Bharigu Rishi, measuring twenty feet long and fourteen broad. Across the river is a temple of P\u00e1rasar Mah\u00e1dev thirty-six feet by eighteen, repaired about seventy years ago.\n\n**Idar**, north latitude 23\u00b0 50', east longitude 73\u00b0 3', the head-quarters of the Idar state, at the foot of Idargad, a rocky hill between 400 and 500 feet high, had, in 1872, a population of 6072 souls. According to tradition Idar has been celebrated from the earliest times. Even in the past cycle, yug, it was known, and in the present cycle, before the days of Vikram, Veni Vachh R\u00e1j ruled at Idar, the happy possessor of a golden figure which helped him to build the hill-fort and its reservoirs. His queen was a N\u00e1gputri, the daughter of a snake-king of the under world, whither, the legend says, she and her consort betook themselves when the queen found that men were mortal. The first clear tradition shews Idar in the possession of Bhils. After the fall of Valabhi, the wife of King Shil\u00e1diya took refuge in a cave in the mountains and there gave birth to a son called 'Goha' or cave-born. Making over the child to a Br\u00e1hman woman, the queen followed her lord through the fire. The young prince, of a daring character and adventurous spirit, soon passed out of his guardian's hands, and joining the Idar Bhils was by them chosen king. Whether in sport or earnest, the election was real, and for several generations his successors ruled in Idar. At last N\u00e1g\u00e1diya the eighth prince was killed by his subjects. He left a son named B\u00e1ppa, who never succeeded to his father's chiefship, but became the founder of a greater kingdom, the present Meyw\u00e1r. The Chinese pilgrim Hwen Thsang (640) mentions a place which he calls O-cha-li, the Chinese way of writing Vad\u00e1ri. This place General Cunningham is inclined to identify with Idar. He further notes that in the eleventh century Vad\u00e1ri was the capital of a family of chiefs claiming descent from R\u00e1ja Bhara Gupta, whom the General believes to be the same as the above-mentioned B\u00e1ppa. According to tradition Idar was refounded by Parih\u00e1r Rajputs, who, subject to Chitor, ruled there for several\n\n---\n\n1 R\u00e1s M\u00e1l\u00e1, 234.\n2 Ancient Geography of India, 494. A considerable and very ancient town called Vad\u00e1li twelve miles to the north of Idar may perhaps be the Vad\u00e1ri referred to. Major E. W. West. General Cunningham would make Vad\u00e1ri the district of the jujube tree also called from another name of the same tree Sauvira, in his opinion, the Ophir or Sophir of the Bible, Ancient Geography, I. 497.\n3 R\u00e1s M\u00e1l\u00e1, 235.\ngenerations. Towards the close of the twelfth century, the Idar chief took part with Pruthuraj, king of Delhi, against the Musalm\u00e1n invaders of India, and was killed in the great Hindu defeat of Th\u00e1nesar (1193). Idar then fell into the hands of a Koli named Hathi Sord who was succeeded by his son S\u00e1malio. The latter was killed by a R\u00e1thod prince named Sonangji, who took possession of Idar, and became the founder of the dynasty of the R\u00e1os who ruled there for several generations. After numerous changes of fortune and many struggles with the Musalm\u00e1ns, the R\u00e1os had at last to leave Idar, and were, in 1728, succeeded by the present R\u00e1thod dynasty from M\u00e1rw\u00e1r.\n\nFrom the south, the road, lined with rows of mango trees, crosses a plain till lately covered with a dense though stunted forest. Beyond the plain small rocky hillocks, strengthened with out-works, so screen the town, that, up to the very gates, nothing of its handsome stone bastioned wall is seen. On the right, about a mile from the town, is the Ranmaleshvar lake, said to have been built by R\u00e1o Ranmal, with its western bank covered with picturesque domed cupolas, chhatris, raised over the ashes of the forefathers of the leading Idar families. Close to the lake is a garden house, and further on, to the left, are enormous granite boulders some crowned with small temples, and others with the remains of fortifications. The town is surrounded by a brick wall in fair preservation, through which the road passes by a stone gateway marked with many red hands each recording a victim to the rite of sati. Inside of the wall, a road, running round the town, leads to the G\u00e1ntino Darv\u00e1jo, a rock-cut passage giving access to the main route to Rajput\u00e1na. Immediately to the left on entering the town is the jail, a large building able to hold about 200 prisoners, and to the right is a small garden worked by convict labour. The road then widens considerably and is on either side lined with rows of houses and trees. Further on it is lost in a series of narrow crooked lanes. Except one or two old stone wells and some carved windows, the town has little of interest. One of the chief buildings is a fine Sv\u00e1min\u00e1r\u00e1yan temple lately raised at a cost of about \u00a35000 (Rs. 50,000). Another temple belonging to the Vallabhacharya sect, still more recently completed at a cost of about \u00a32000 (Rs. 20,000), has not yet been consecrated. At the end of the town and immediately under the hill is the palace, a large building with no architectural pretensions. Behind the palace, on the south-western face of the range of hills, which joins the Vindhya and \u00c1ravali mountains, rises Idargad, so steep, rocky, and well fortified, that according to the local saying, to take Idargad is to achieve the impossible. From the palace a steep and easily held pathway leads through more than one gateway and fortified work to the fortress plateau, a table land raised well above the plain surrounded by heights, and with the gaps in the crest filled in and strengthened by ramparts. From below, two buildings, on opposite peaks, attract attention. That to the left, low and flat-roofed, known as Ranmal's\n\n---\n\n1 The wall is of brick with stones inserted here and there.\n2 R\u00e1s M\u00e1la, 233.\nChapter XIV.\n\nPlaces of Interest.\n\nIdar.\n\nObjects of Interest.\n\nChoki or guardroom, seems to be an unfinished Jain temple, the building of which was stopped after the flat stone ceiling had been put on. The other building, on an enormous granite peak to the right, domed and of fine stone, lately smothered with whitewash, is known as the Angry Queen's Palace.\\(^1\\) It measures twenty-five feet long by nineteen broad and twelve high. The story is that when R\u00e1o N\u00e1r\u00e1yanji, or N\u00e1rand\u00e1s (1573) driven from Idar by Akbar, took refuge in Polio, in spite of a terrible ulcer on his back, he continued to harass the Musalm\u00e1ns. One day, when his back was being dressed, his R\u00e1ni came into the room, and, seeing the fearful sore, mournfully shook her head. Noticing this in a mirror, the R\u00e1o asked why she shook her head. She said 'from what I see I have no hope that you will regain your lost throne.' This so annoyed her husband that he left the house, and, afterwards, when he retook Idar, he refused to see the R\u00e1ni's face. Disgusted at this treatment, and unwilling to live in her husband's palace, the R\u00e1ni had a dwelling built on the highest peak of the hill and there passed the rest of her life.\\(^2\\) Some centuries after, this palace was the scene of a cruel assassination. Surajmal, Th\u00e1kor of Ch\u00e1ndni who had saved Idar from the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, was so puffed up by his success that he gave great offence, especially to Bhav\u00e1nising the son and heir-apparent of the old Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Shivsing. Bent on revenge the prince invited Surajmal to a feast, and, under pretence of inspecting the fort, took him up to the Angry Queen's Palace and there killed him.\\(^3\\) The way into the fort is by a stone paved pathway, the stone slippery and polished from the wear of ages. Passing under more or less ruined gateways the pathway leads to a part of the hill between, and much lower than, the two peaks. Following the path, on the right hand is a small garden with a house built by the late Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja after a mount \u00c1bu pattern. Within the garden are some ruins said to be remains of the R\u00e1os' old palace. Further on is a well preserved freestone and brick Jain temple, belonging to the Sv\u00e4tambari sect and dedicated to Shri Sh\u00e1ntin\u00e1thji the sixteenth T\u00edrthankar. This temple, measuring 160 feet by 125 and 55 high, is evidently of considerable age, but there is no writing to show its exact date. Near the temple is a deep reservoir always filled with water. At some distance, and higher up the western side of the hill, is another temple, belonging to the Digambari sect of Jains and dedicated to Shri Shambhavn\u00e1thji the third T\u00edrthankar. This seems of even greater age than the other, but, like it, bears no date. Within the limits of the fort, with a wall and terraces in front, is a natural cavern twenty-eight feet by eighteen and seven high, containing an image of Vajar M\u00e1ta a goddess worshipped by Hindus of all castes. The whole of the hill is surrounded with more or less ruined fortifications. To the rear are the remains of a fortified gateway, opening on the plain behind, a way of escape for the too hard-\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) 'Ruthi R\u00e1niyo Mohol'.

The interior of the hill-fort, or rather fortified hill, is very striking from the dense brushwood by which the ruins are more or less hid. Perhaps the finest view is near Shambhav\u00e1nathji\u2019s temple, whence, looking towards the Angry Queen\u2019s Palace, the sheer scarp of the great granite peak, towering above the trees, stands clear against the sky. The Queen\u2019s palace is rather difficult to reach, as, besides climbing to the top of the peak, a high smooth narrow granite ridge, unsafe for booted feet, has to be crossed. At the foot of the fort is a part-ruined cave temple of Khokhm\u00e1th Mah\u00e1dev, thirty feet long by twenty broad and from four to six high, supposed to be upwards of 400 years old. On a rising ground, south of the town and close to the wall, is the cave temple of Dhaneshvar Mah\u00e1dev, a natural rock cavern twenty feet long by ten broad and from five to seven high. Three-quarters of a mile south-west of the town, on a rising ground, is the cave of Mank\u00e1leshvar Mah\u00e1dev, twenty feet long by twelve broad and from five to ten high.\n\nJetpur, three miles from G\u00e1b\u00e1t in N\u00e1ni M\u00e1rv\u00e1r, has a fine lake, the Kh\u00fanera Tal\u00e1v, with a masonry embankment said to have been made under the orders of Sidhr\u00e1j Jaysing (1094 - 1143).\n\nKhed Brahma or Brahma Khed, a revenue and police station, th\u00e1na, on the right bank of the Harn\u00e1i river some thirty miles north of the town of Idar, is of considerable size, and bears a high, and, as the ruins of many temples show, a very old name for sanctity. Some of the shrines within the limits of the modern town have lost their virtue, and are now most dirty and uncared-for. The most interesting remains are in the forest to the north of the town. Among them, perhaps the most noteworthy, is, on the bank of a dried-up lake, a temple in fair preservation and with many features of architectural interest. Inside is a sculptured female figure springing out of a pillar, which, in delicacy of contour and freedom from conventional treatment, is quite unlike the figures usually seen in Hindu temples. The building, from which the place takes its name, known as Bhrigu Rishi\u2019s shrine, is sacred to\n\n---\n\n1 It was through this gateway that Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja \u00c1nandsingji fled in 1733 and was attacked and slain by a party of Rehvar horse. R\u00e1s M\u00e1la, 454.\n\n2 According to the Brahma Pur\u00e1n this place owes its sanctity to a desire of Brahma to free himself from impurity. Vishnu, whom he consulted as to the means, advised him to perform a sacrifice at some holy spot in Bharatkhand in the Jambudvipa, and get learned Br\u00e1hmans to officiate for him. Under Brahma\u2019s orders, Vishvakarma built a handsome city on the right bank of the S\u00e1barmati south of mount Abu, six miles (4 kos) round. It had golden ramparts and twenty-four gates and through it flowed the river Hirany\u00e1ksh, the modern Harndi. He then created 9000 Br\u00e1hmans to officiate at the sacrifice. And, when the sacrifice was over, and the impurity removed, to maintain his Br\u00e1hmans, he created 18,000 Vaishyas and gave them Kshirja as their family goddess. Before withdrawing from the world, he let the Br\u00e1hmans dedicate a shrine to him, and place in it his four-faced image.\n\n3 According to the Brahma Pur\u00e1n, the temple was built by Bhrigu, Brahma\u2019s son who was once sent by the seers, rishis, to find out who was the noblest of the Hindu trinity. Insulting Brahma and Rudra, they got angry and threatened to punish him. Seeking out Vishnu, Bhrigu was bold enough to place his foot on the god\u2019s chest. Instead of resenting, the kindly god asked the seer\u2019s pardon for the hardness of his breast. Bhrigu returned and praised Vishnu as the noblest of the gods. To wipe out the sin of insulting the gods, Bhrigu came to Brahma Kshetra, bathed in the Hirany\u00e1ksh, made his hermitage the seat of a Mah\u00e1dev, and performed such rigid austerities, that Shiv was pleased and freed him from his sin.\nChapter XIV.\n\nPlaces of Interest.\n\nKhed Brahma.\n\nBrahma\\(^1\\) and has lately been put in repair by the Br\u00e1hmans of the town. Of white sandstone and cement-covered brick, fifty-seven feet long, thirty broad, and thirty-six high, it has an image of Brahma which is worshipped. The town is close to the Pol hills and its sanctity has probably saved it from destruction by the wild hill tribes. The fair, held yearly in February (M\u00e1h sud 14) and attended by merchants from all parts of Gujar\u00e1t and Meyw\u00e1r, comes next in importance to S\u00e1ml\u00e1ji. Under the supervision of an Idar officer, order is kept by detachments of the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r's contingent and by foot police.

They are said to be the remains of a group of 360 temples built by Vimalsha (1032). Of the destruction of the other buildings the story is that, though he owed her his riches, when Amba Bhav\u00e1ni asked who had helped him to build the temples, Vimalsha thrice answered, 'My spiritual guide'. Enraged at his ungratefulness the goddess ordered him to fly for his life. Seeking shelter in the crypt of one of the temples, he came out unhurt on mount \u00c1bu. But of his 360 temples all but five were destroyed. The only guide to the probable age of the temples are two writings. One of 1223 (S.1279), on a memorial stone close by, states that Shri Dh\u00e1r\u00e1varshdev the lord of Arbuda, the thorn to all petty rulers under the sun, built a well in the city of Arsanpur. The other, in the temple of Nemin\u00e1th, dated 1249, records additions to the buildings made by Brahmadev, the son of Ch\u00e1had, the minister of Kum\u00e1rp\u00e1l Solanki (1143 - 1174).\\(^3\\)\n\nLimbohi.\n\nLimbohi, three miles north of Idar, behind the hill fort, has a temple of K\u00e1ln\u00e1th Mah\u00e1dev still in use, and measuring thirty-seven feet long by fifteen broad and thirty high, with a partly ruined rest-house built of white sandstone and plastered brick.\n\nMagodi.\n\nMagodi, in N\u00e1ni M\u00e1rw\u00e1r, has three memorial stones, p\u00e1l\u00ed\u00e1s, one with the figure of a horseman and another with a worn-out inscription.

The K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r traders used to raise booths on the south bank of the Hirany\u00e1dksh and deal in opium, cloth, copperware, jewelry, grocery, and horses. The gathering lasted for fifteen days. Goods worth a l\u00edkh were sold. The fair is said to have fallen into comparative unimportance from the time of R\u00e1o Kal\u00e1nnal (about 1630), when the state fell a prey to rebellion and disorder.\n\n\\(^2\\) The details of sales are: 1874, \u00a36190; 1875, \u00a36261; 1876, \u00a37342; 1877, \u00a37925; 1878, \u00a36533; and 1879, \u00a38662.\n\n\\(^3\\) R\u00e1s M\u00e1l\u00e1, 329.\nTh\u00e1kor.

The only trace of former greatness is an image of P\u00e1rasn\u00e1th long ago removed to the Jain temple of Tintoi, eight miles off, and still known as Mori-no-P\u00e1rasn\u00e1th.\n\nPetha'pur, north latitude 23\u00b0 14' and east longitude 72\u00b0 40', on the west bank of the S\u00e1barmati, the principal place in Peth\u00e1pur and the residence of the chief, has a population of 6842 souls. It is noted for its dyed cloths sent in considerable quantities to Si\u00e1m, and for the manufacture of matchlocks, swords, and knives.\n\nPosina, in the Idar state in the north of the Mahi K\u00e1ntha, has white sandstone temples of P\u00e1rasn\u00e1th and Nemin\u00e1th, measuring 150 feet long by 140 broad and 26 high.\n\nPra'ntvel, about four miles from G\u00e1bat, has, on a raised platform, three memorial stones, and round the platform thirty or forty graves.

When, in 1821, the Mahi K\u00e1ntha Agency was established, a piece of land near the village was rented from the V\u00e1sna Th\u00e1kor for a station. In the ground was a small fort said to have been built by Sult\u00e1n Ahmad I. (1411-1443), when (1426) he built the fort of Ahmednagar. Colonel Ballantyne, the first Political Agent, built a picturesque bungalow on the side of the fort next the river, using the ramparts as part of the house. This, afterwards bought by Government, is still the Political Agent's residence. A broad well laid out marketplace, with rows of trees on both sides, and well lighted at night, leads from the Ahmedabad road to the fort. Near the Agency residence is a small, neat hospital, built with money subscribed by the Mahi K\u00e1ntha chiefs. A house for the apothecary in charge adjoins the hospital, and next to that is a library and reading-room also built by subscription. In front of the reading-room, an arch, originally part of some old Hindu temple, has been put up with a very happy effect. The other public buildings are, a rest-house close to the library, another much larger one built by the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r's Government in memory of Bh\u00e1u Sindia, and a small police\n\n\u00b9 In old days Mori would seem to have included the whole S\u00e1ml\u00e1ji valley.

The population of the S\u00e1dra station is 2446 souls, and that of the adjoining village of S\u00e1dra, 2253. Of a revenue, in 1878, of \u00a3357 (Rs. 3570), \u00a326 (Rs. 260) were paid to the V\u00e1sna chief as rent. There is a vernacular school attended by eighty-six boys and a girls' school attached, with twenty-one pupils. There is also, with eighteen pupils on the register, a T\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri school for minor chiefs and the relations of chiefs.\n\nSA'MLA'JI.\n\nSa'mla'ji, on the border between Mahi K\u00e1ntha and Meyw\u00e1r, the head-quarters of an Idar police post, has, amidst hills, on the banks of the Meshva, a temple of great sanctity. Near the temple the river forms deep pools, much resorted to by persons bewitched or devil-possessed. To the north the waters of the Karm\u00e1nu pond, and the Surya reservoir have the property of washing away sin. Numerous ruins show that S\u00e1mk\u00e1ji's name for sanctity is of very ancient date. In a beautiful valley shut in by well wooded hills through which the Meshva winds, the present temple dedicated to S\u00e1ml\u00e1ji, a name of Krishna, is 400 years old. Built of white sandstone and brick it is surrounded by a wall with a gateway. It is of two stories, supported on pillars, and a canopy with arches on each side. The lower courses of richly carved stone are of great age. Above them runs a frieze with an unintelligible pattern, and, above this, running right round the building, a fringe of elephants' heads and forequarters carved in stone. Above this is a very much worn frieze full of figures in bas-relief, men on horseback with bows, and animals. The elephant is a very favourite emblem. Besides the fringe frieze above mentioned, there are, on the outer wall, between every two angles, larger figures of semi-rampant elephants standing out in relief, and, in front of the entrance, stands on either side of the doorway a gigantic cement elephant. Above the shrine, a pyramid-based tower rises into a spire like a high-shouldered cone with flattened sides. The forepart of the roof consists of a number of small domes springing from a flat roof, or rather of a flat trabeate roof, with domes here and there, the largest being in the centre. Outside at all the angles of the roof are figures of animals and demons like the gargoyles seen on some English churches. The Jains claim S\u00e1ml\u00e1ji's temple, and the style of the old part supports their claim. Of the two inscriptions, one is to the left in the upper story and bears date 94 A.D. and 102 A.D. This writing, cut in stone, is not very archaic and could not be of the date it professes to record. It may be a transcript of an older inscription or the record of an old tradition. The other, on copper at the entrance of the temple, records repairs executed in\n\n---\n\n1 The 14th of K\u00e1rtik sud (November) is the day for dipping possessed persons. 'I saw a lot of them,' writes Major West, 'undergoing the process. All were women. They sat in the water and were surrounded by friends who splashed them well, occasionally varying the process by cuffing them or beating them with twigs, at the same time lavishly pouring abuse on the demons.'\n1762 A.D. by the then Th\u00e1kor of Tintoi. From these two inscriptions the name of the deity seems to be Gad\u00e1dhari, the holder of the club, a well known title of Vishnu, Krishna, or S\u00e1ml\u00e1ji. Among many temples and shrines round the main building, three deserve notice. Of these one is called 'Old S\u00e1ml\u00e1ji', though it does not seem as old as the ancient part of the present temple. If the Jains' statement is correct, this was perhaps the original temple of S\u00e1ml\u00e1ji, and the image was transferred to the other building after it had been taken from the Jains. The other two temples are architecturally interesting. One of them dedicated to Somn\u00e1r\u00e1yan, is, except the adytum, open on all sides, with a flat ceiling, surmounted by a pyramidal roof, supported on plain square stone pillars with carved capitals. Part of the shrine walls seem to have been formed of a series of upright stone slabs with sculptured figures in low relief. Many of these still remain.\n\nThe most curious thing about the building is that, at the front and rear and both sides, in the centre of the fa\u00e7ade the roof ends in a triangular pediment composed of boldly sculptured figures. Inside the building near the shrine, and, on the left hand as one faces it, is a remarkable human head in high relief standing out from the base of the span of an arch. The features are more human-looking than those generally seen in Hindu temples, and the arrangement of the hair is curious. There is a corresponding face on the other side but it is much worn or broken, while this is fresh and clear in its lines. In the shrine, part of the original altar or image seat still remains. It has been roughly heightened by bricks loosely piled on it, and on the raised superstructure stands a slab with a representation said to be of Somn\u00e1r\u00e1yan. This slab probably originally formed part of the outer wall of the shrine. The third temple, now dedicated to Mah\u00e1dev, is underground, the top of its pyramidal roof rising to the level of the land round it. It is entered through a gateway by a gradually deepening passage. Perhaps the temple was originally built in a hollow which has filled up. It looks old though not so old as Somn\u00e1r\u00e1yan's the most ancient looking building in the place. Except this and the great S\u00e1ml\u00e1ji temple in which worship is still carried on, the numerous fanes are deserted and falling into ruin. A large yearly fair is held on K\u00e1rtik sud 15th (October). This, once of great importance, had, in consequence of the disorders of the latter years of the eighteenth and the early part of the present centuries, fallen into disuse, and was restored by Sir J. Outram, the Political Agent, in 1838. On guaranteeing certain small payments to the petty chiefs the safety of traders was ensured, and the fair became a most important resort not only for the wild local tribes, but for merchants from all parts of Gujar\u00e1t, Rajput\u00e1na, and Central India. Since then the fair has maintained its position as an important centre of trade. Of late the total sales have fallen from an average of about \u00a388,000 (Rs. 8,80,000) in the four years ending 1876 to \u00a328,975 (Rs. 2,89,750) in 1877, and \u00a323,053 (Rs. 2,30,530) in 1878. This fall is chiefly due to the scarcity of 1878 and the prohibition of the opium trade in 1879. But it seems probable\n\n---\n\n1 The details are: 1873, \u00a391,992; 1874, \u00a385,478; 1875, \u00a387,933; and 1876, \u00a390,693.\nthat with the regular supply of goods made possible by the spread of railways, the importance of the S\u00e1ml\u00e1ji fair will continue to decline.

The Jain temples of Shri Ajitn\u00e1thji and Shambhavn\u00e1thji, the resort of numerous votaries from all parts of India, stand on a hill in the petty state of Temba in G\u00e1dv\u00e1da, about twenty miles south of D\u00e1nta. The hill bears the name of T\u00e1ringa, probably as Forbes suggests, from a shrine that has long been there dedicated to a local deity T\u00e1ran M\u00e1ta. The hill for the most part covered with brushwood and forest is, on the east and west, crossed by paths that lead to a plateau where stand the temples built of white sandstone and brick. The temples are of no very great size, the enclosure measuring 230 feet round, and the temples 125 feet high, but it is hard to see how the stones were ever brought through the forest to the top of the hill. The red interior of the temple throws out in strong relief the white marble figure of Ajitn\u00e1thji, the second Tirthankar seated in the shrine, decorated with precious stones let into the marble. The features wear the usual expression of deep repose or quiet covert scorn. The main temple was built by Kum\u00e1r P\u00e1l of Anhilv\u00e1da (1143-1174) after he became a convert to Jain tenets. The special times of pilgrimage are during the full moon in the months of K\u00e1rtik and Chaitra (November and April). In the adjoining shrines are various images. In one is an upright block of marble with 208 representations of the Tirthankar.\n\nTelnal, on the V\u00e1trak, has, about a mile from the village, a very old and lately repaired temple of K\u00e9d\u00e1reshvar.\n\nVada'li, a considerable and very ancient town twelve miles north of Idar, is perhaps the O-cha-li or Vadari which Hwen Thsang visited between M\u00e1lwa and Valabhi. In the eleventh century Vad\u00e1li was the centre of a very large kingdom. It is a revenue and police station, th\u00e1na, and is a prosperous town with a population of 5048 souls and many good houses.\n\n---\n\n1 R\u00e1s M\u00e1la, 283.\n2 Genl. Cunningham (Ancient Geography of India, 494) identifies Vad\u00e1ri with Idar.\nAppendix A.\n\nThe Honourable Mr. Mountstuart Elphinstone's Minute.\u00b9\n\nWe labour under a great disadvantage in all deliberations regarding this tract of country, as I believe no account of it is before the Government, for Major Ballantyne's report is chiefly confined to the proceedings of the Gaikwar force in 1813. This deficiency cannot be made up by information collected during a passage through the country, but I hope it will soon be removed, by the inquiries which I have directed Captain Miles to make, and by those of Major Ballantyne when he shall have taken charge. In the meantime, I owe much to the information I have received from Captain Barnewall, whose long employment in the Kaira district has rendered him particularly well acquainted with the adjoining parts of the Mahi Kantha.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to mention that the fiscal and military division known by the name of Mahi Kantha is not, as that name implies, confined to the banks of the Mahi, but extends northward from that river to the Banas, a distance of 120 miles, and includes all the part of Gujar\u00e1t which requires the presence of a military force to procure the payment of the Gaikwar tribute, that is, all the north or north-eastern portion of the province.\n\nThe mountains which bound Gujar\u00e1t in that direction are steep, craggy, and difficult of access. They send many branches into the nearest parts of Gujar\u00e1t, and the intervals between them are nearly filled up with jungle. Further south the hills cease, and afterwards the jungles become less extensive; but the rivers are very numerous and their banks abound in long, deep and intricate ravines overgrown with thick jungle. All these obstacles diminish as we go south, the jungle nearly disappears, and the rivers unite in the streams of the Sabarmati and the Mahi; and nearly the whole of the south-west of Gujar\u00e1t, a tract sixty miles deep, extending for 150 miles along the gulf and Cambay, the frontier of Kathiawar and the Ran is an open and fertile plain. This description explains the degrees of subjugation in which the province is found. The plain was almost entirely reduced, and the government of the Marathas through the jungles of Chuv\u00e1l, west of Ahmedabad and the banks of the Mahi as far south as the neighbourhood of Baroda, still furnish shelter to independent villages. When the streams begin to be numerous, many independent communities appear among the ravines and jungle on their banks. The rivers increase, the jungle grows thicker and more continued\n\n\u00b9 Dated at Lohar, 28th February 1821.\nAppendix A.\n\nMr. Elphinstone's Minute.\n\n1821.\n\nas we advance, and the independent villages become more frequent and in more solid masses until we reach the principalities of Idar and Lunavada, amidst the mountains and the forest of the north-east.\n\nThe degree of independence in those communities increases with their numbers. In the plain to the south, and in the open spaces that run up between the rivers, the Maratha government had the right of administering justice in every village, by means of its own officers, and it always took an account of the produce of the village lands of which it was entitled to a certain share. All the other villages retained their independence on the payment of a tribute. Most of those which lay on the rivers in the midst of subjugated country paid it regularly every year to the nearest revenue officer, but those whose situations were stronger or more remote withheld their tribute until compelled to pay by the presence of an invalid army. The villages which submit to the administration of justice and the inspection of their produce are called ryoti; those which only pay a tribute, mehvasi, but this last term is not extended to princes like those of Idar and Lunavada. The tribute paid annually to the revenue officer is called jamabandi; that collected by an officer at the head of an army is called ghadsdana. There are many Mehvasis, who, though they are willing to pay a small sum to the kamavisdars, will not submit to the exaction of a large one unless supported by force. These pay both jamabandi and ghadsdana, the former to the collector every year, the latter to the commandant of the force that is occasionally sent to levy it. Both descriptions however are equally tribute and neither is a fixed share of the produce.\n\nAlthough the whole of the above distinctions took their origin from the different degrees in which the communities which are the subjects of them were subjected to the power of the Maratha government, yet the distinction has often been preserved when the cause has been removed. Many villages remain Mehvasi which the Gaikwar could have rendered ryoti, and in many cases the ghadsdana is still collected by the military commander where the Mehvasi would have been equally ready to pay it to the kamavisdar, and where his payment to that officer much exceeds his contribution to the army. The amount of the payments continued to fluctuate after the denominations had become fixed; when the kamavisdar, or the military chief, was strong, he increased the jamabandi or the ghadsdana, and when weak, he was glad to take a smaller sum than had been paid the year before. On the whole, however, there was a progressive increase in the payment.\n\nIt is the ghadsdana alone that is included in the Mahi Kantha collections.\n\nThe Mahi Kantha, though so much of it is neglected, shows great fertility wherever it is cultivated. The fields seem well taken care of and covered with fine crops. Mangoes and other planted trees are unusually numerous and as the surface is undulating, and the woods and mountains soften in sight, no part of India presents a richer or more agreeable prospect.\n\nThere are in the Mahi Kantha many Kanbis, some Vaniyas and other peaceable classes, but the castes that bear arms and those in whom all authority of the country is vested, are the Rajputs, Kolis and Makvanis of whom the Kolis are by far the most numerous, even in the country belonging to the Rajputs. Of the 121 chiefs settled with by Major Ballantyne, eleven are Rajputs, seventy-nine Kolis, and thirty-one Makvanis and other Musalmans, but this bears no proportion to the number of each caste. The Rajput and Musalman principalities of Idar and Palanpur are nearly as extensive as all the rest put together, but many, perhaps\nmost of their subjects, are Kolis. The Rajputs are of two descriptions, the M\u00e1rv\u00e1dis who accompanied the R\u00e1ja of Idar in his emigration from Jodhpur, and the Gujar\u00e1t\u00eds who have long been settled in the province, chiefly in the central parts. The M\u00e1rv\u00e1dis resemble the people of Jodhpur in their dress and manners but with additional rudeness contracted in their sequestered situation. They are said to be very brave but stupid, slothful, unprincipled and devoted to the use of opium and intoxicating liquors. Those of Gujar\u00e1t are said to resemble more the inhabitants of that province, to be more civilized than the M\u00e1rv\u00e1dis, more honest, more submissive and more inactive and unwarlike. All the Rajputs use swords and spears, matchlocks and shields. They often use defensive armour of leather both for themselves and their horses, and sometimes, but rarely, carry bows. Their plan of war is to defend their villages. They seldom take to the woods like Kolis, and are quite incapable of the desultory warfare so congenial to the habits of the latter tribe. The Kolis or Bhils (for they are called indiscriminately by both names) are by much the most numerous and most important of the inhabitants of the Mahi K\u00e1ntha. Though there is not perhaps a very marked difference in feature between them and the other inhabitants, yet they are generally to be distinguished without difficulty; they seem more diminutive and have an expression both of liveliness and cunning in their eyes. They wear small turbans and few clothes and are seldom seen without a quiver of arrows and a long bamboo bow which is instantly bent on any alarm, or on the sudden approach of a stranger. If they have less appearance of strength and activity than the generality of their neighbours, the defect is confined to their appearance.\n\nThe natives describe them as wonderfully swift, active and hardy, incredibly patient of hunger, thirst, fatigue and want of sleep, vigilant, enterprising, secret, fertile in expedients, and admirably calculated for night attacks, surprises and ambuscades. These qualities are probably exaggerated; but they certainly are active, hardy, and as remarkable for sagacity as for secrecy and celerity in their predatory operations. Their arms and habits render them unfit to stand in the field, and they must be admitted to be timid where attacked; but they have on several occasions shown extraordinary boldness in assaults even on English stations. They are of an independent spirit, and although they are all professed robbers, they are said to be remarkably faithful when they are trusted, and they are certainly never sanguinary. They are averse to regular industry, exceedingly addicted to drunkenness, and very quarrelsome when intoxicated. Their delight is plunder, and nothing is so welcome to them as a general disturbance in the country.\n\nThe numbers of this tribe can scarcely be guessed at. The whole of the country between Guj\u00e1r\u00e1t and M\u00e1lwa at the mountainous tracts on the Narbada and in Kh\u00e1ndesh and Ber\u00e1r, together with the range of Gh\u00e1ts and its neighbourhood as far south as Poona, are filled with Bhils and Kolis; but it is those only to the west of the Mahi that are connected with the Mahi K\u00e1ntha. It has been calculated on tolerable grounds that there are 6600 in the Kaira district, and as there are fewer there than in any division in Guj\u00e1r\u00e1t, the whole amount must be very considerable. Their numbers would certainly be formidable if they were at all united; but though the Kolis have a strong fellow-feeling for each other, they never think of themselves as a nation, and never make a common cause to oppose an external enemy.\n\nThe Musalm\u00e1ns of Guj\u00e1r\u00e1t are generally indolent and effeminate, but those in Mehv\u00e1si villages, especially the Malaiks, have almost as much activity as the Kolis with much courage.\nAppendix A.\n\nMr. Elphinstone's Minute.\n\n1821.\n\nThe Makv\u00e1nis are Kolis nominally converted to Muhammadanism, but scarcely altered in the religion, manner or character. They are chiefly settled towards the south-east of the Mahi K\u00e1nta.\n\nThe chiefs by whom the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r tribute is paid, and the transactions which have taken place regarding it as far as they affect our interposition, and the measures to be adopted for realizing it in future, and for securing the quiet of the country and of our own districts in the neighbourhood, are as follows.\n\nBeginning from the north, the first chief to notice would be the Diw\u00e1n of P\u00e1lanpur. But as his country is of a different character from the rest of the Mahi K\u00e1nta, and is now separated from it by our own political arrangements, it will be convenient to pass him over for the present.\n\nThe R\u00e1ja of Idar is the fifth in descent from Ajitsing who reigned at Jodhpur about 100 years ago. His ancestor obtained possession of Idar about eighty years ago. It was at that time a part of the Jodhpur territory. Ajitsing having driven out another R\u00e1thod prince who was called the R\u00e1o and still retains that title, though his territory is confined to the small but strong district of Pol in the hills between Idar and Udepur. He still continues his claims to Idar and often harasses the R\u00e1ja who some years ago had a temporary possession of Pol.\n\nThe revenue of the state of Idar amounts to about Rs. 4,00,000 (\u00a340,000) without including its dependencies of Ahmednagar and Mod\u00e1sa. But the R\u00e1ja's share is not more than from 100,000 to 150,000 rupees. The rest is allotted to chiefs who hold of him under the Rajput designation of Pat\u00e1vats, on condition of military service and of a small pecuniary payment. Besides these eight chiefs who are all R\u00e1thods like the R\u00e1ja, and whose ancestors accompanied him from Jodhpur, there are between twenty and thirty Pat\u00e1vats of the R\u00e1o's, who held lands of the prince for military service, but who now pay an annual tribute instead of it to the R\u00e1ja. These persons are Rajputs and Kolis; they owe no service to the R\u00e1ja; they settle their gh\u00e1sd\u00e1na separately with the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r and appear to look up to him as their superior rather than to the R\u00e1ja. The R\u00e1ja of Idar's tribute as fixed by Major Ballantyne amounts to Rs. 24,000 (\u00a32400), though much more has been exacted by the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r's officer. Only one-fourth of the amount falls on the R\u00e1ja. The remaining three-fourths are paid by his Pat\u00e1vats from whom, since the decline of the R\u00e1ja's power, it has been levied separately by the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r. The whole ultimately falls on the ryots on whom an extra cess is imposed to meet it. The troops in the R\u00e1ja of Idar's own pay amount at present to 250 horse and 1000 foot, but these are raised for a particular occasion; his usual force is fifty horse and 150 foot. His Pat\u00e1vats should furnish 500 horses and as many foot, but very few ever attend. He has however about 600 men who hold lands direct of the R\u00e1ja on condition of service which they never fail to afford.\n\nBesides the R\u00e1ja's and the R\u00e1o's Pat\u00e1vats, there are three other chiefs whose territory is included in the principality of Idar, though in reality they are almost entirely independent of that government.\n\nThe names of these petty chiefships are Ahmednagar, Mod\u00e1sa, and Baur. Each of the former yields a revenue of about Rs. 30,000 (\u00a33000) a year, and their payments to the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r are Rs. 10,000 (\u00a31000) for Ahmednagar, and Rs. 7305 (\u00a3730) for Mod\u00e1sa. Both together maintain about 100 horse and 200 foot. Baur yields only Rs. 5000 (\u00a3500) a year. The chief of Ahmednagar is the mortal enemy of his cousin the R\u00e1ja of\nIdar, and their enmity is at present raised to the highest pitch by a dispute regarding Mod\u00e1sa, which the R\u00e1ja claims as having reverted to him by the death of the last chief without issue, while the chief of Ahmednagar holds it for his son whom he alleges to have been adopted by the deceased chief.\n\nTo complete the list of the Idar chiefs, it may be necessary to mention nine Koli villages on the S\u00e1barmati which used to belong to Idar and still pay a trifling tribute; but they have been long considered as separate and are probably entirely beyond the R\u00e1ja's control.\n\nThe territory of Idar, though open towards the west, is generally very strong, abounding in rivers, hills and forests. The soil is fertile and from the innumerable mango trees it seems to have been once well cultivated, but at present the greater portion is overrun with jungle. The R\u00e1ja's government is said to be very oppressive, those of his Pat\u00e1vats less so. The town of Idar is conjectured to contain upwards of 2500 houses which would give from 10,000 to 12,000 inhabitants. Mod\u00e1sa is less than Idar. Ahmednagar, situated within the walls of a magnificent fort of the Muhammadan kings, is only a large village.\n\nThe whole of the Idar country is now disturbed by the chief of Titui, who though a Pat\u00e1vat of the R\u00e1ja has latterly settled separately with the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r. This innovation has led to fresh assertions of independence, and has finally brought about a war between the chief of Titui and the R\u00e1ja, the result of which has subjected all the neighbourhood to plunder. The R\u00e1ja is on bad terms with all his Pat\u00e1vats, and though a plausible man in his behaviour is generally considered as of a wavering and faithless character, quite incapable of steadily conducting his affairs. His misfortunes, however, are not entirely to be ascribed to his want of liberty. The chief of Ahmednagar was always rather a rival than a support to the head of his family, and the Mod\u00e1sa chief with most of the Pat\u00e1vats established their present independence during the long minority of the R\u00e1ja.\n\nThe R\u00e1ja of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da is descended from a family of Salanka Rajputs who have long possessed the small territory now under his government. His income is stated by Captain MacDonald to be Rs. 40,473 (\u00a34047) and for his chiefs about 40,000 more, making the whole revenue of the territory amount to about Rs. 80,000 (\u00a38000). From this he pays a tribute to Sindia of Rs. 12,000 (\u00a31200) and another to the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r of Rs. 6501 (\u00a3650). It is not known when the former tribute was first levied, nor indeed can the first payment to the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r be ascertained with precision, the earliest on Baroda records being stated by Mr. Norris to be in 1783 A.D. This tribute was settled for ten years at Rs. 6501 (\u00a3650) per annum by Major Ballantyne in 1813.\n\nThe remaining chiefs have sometimes only one village and sometimes as many as fifty. Their incomes vary from Rs. 30,000 (\u00a33000) a year to Rs. 1000 (\u00a3100), but their importance depends on the number of fighting men they can assemble from villages or those of their allies. The annexed table, prepared by Captain Barnewall, will give some notion\n\n---\n\nThis table shows that, including the P\u00e1l\u00e1npur gh\u00eds\u00e1d\u00e1na chiefs, of 121 petty chieftains, t\u00e1tuk\u00e9d\u00e1rs, with a total yearly revenue of \u00a3108,570 (Rs. 10,85,700), and a body of 84,225 armed followers, sixty-three were subject to the British and fifty-eight to the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r Government. These were arranged under three classes: the first of twenty-two chiefs with yearly incomes of \u00a3300 to \u00a325,000 (Rs. 3000 - Rs. 2,50,000), and 1500 to 8000 armed attendants; the second of thirty-six chiefs with yearly incomes of \u00a320 to \u00a317,500 (Rs. 200 - Rs. 1,75,000), and 150 to 1200 attendants; and the third of sixty-three with yearly incomes of \u00a330 to \u00a3500 (Rs. 300 - Rs. 5000), and 25 to 300 followers.\nAppendix A.\n\nMr. Elphinstone's Minute.\n\n1821.\n\nof the income and number of retainers of each chief. The most considerable among them may be divided into four or five clusters, according to their geographical position. The first is composed of the Koli villages of Amballa and Lohar (both of which have several times defeated the Gaikwar armies), the Koli village of Nirmal and the Makwani ones of Mandva, Pannadra, and Koral. These all lie within a space of fifteen miles and mostly on the river Vatrak. Another of nine Koli villages of Aglode, Huppa, Taujpur, &c., lies on the Saharmati in the Bijapur sub-division, pargana. Immediately to the south of the above are the Rajput villages of Varsoda, Pelyani, Mansa, and Pethapur. The Kolis of Kankrej near the Banas and those of Chuval and Chore Barochra in the north-west of the Ahmedabad district are very numerous, the former amounting, it is said, to 8000 and the other to 5000 bows, but their country is not strong and they have ceased to be troublesome to their neighbours. Each of the others can produce from 1500 to 3000 fighting men, and all are in the neighbourhood of very strong retreats.\n\nIn all the Mehvasi communities the Rajputs, Kolis, and Musalmans, hold their lands free of rent on condition of military service; the other classes pay revenue to the chief. The chief's authority varies with his circumstances and personal character, but in general he is able to keep the people of his village in sufficient order to prevent their disturbing their neighbours, and his power in this respect is increased when supported by the fear of the superior government.\n\nThe Kolis and Makwans are not usually in the practice of dividing their lands among brothers, and from this and their frugal habits they are generally out of debt. The divisions, the carelessness and waste of the Rajputs leave most of them considerably involved.\n\nFrom the ruins of the ancient Muhammadan cities of Patan, Ahmednagar and Ahmedabad, one would be led to infer that these were at one time the capitals of considerable principalities and consequently that the neighbouring country, some of which is now the most refractory, must have then been quiet and submissive under the Moghals. Things seem to have been something like their present state. The ruins of numerous and expensive castles built by those monarchs to check the Mehvasis are still to be seen in frequented parts of the Mahi Kantha. But these measures were probably not very effectual when in vigor, and in the decline of the Moghal monarchy the garrisons were withdrawn and the country abandoned to its turbulent inhabitants.\n\nThe case was altered on the appearance of the Marathas, who, without building forts or assuming the direct government, carried on their usual harassing inroads until they extorted a tribute which they continued to increase as opportunity offered. Their power was at its highest about thirty years ago when Sivram Gardi, a Hindustani commandant of regular infantry, was employed in the settlement of the Mahi Kantha. The disorders of the Gaikwar government subsequent to the death of Fatehsing did away the effects of Sivram's successes, but after the treaty of Baroda about the year 1804, order was very effectually restored by Kakaji, the cousin of Raroji Apaji, and although the Gaikwar's troops have met with some reverses since then, yet there has never been any general spirit of resistance. In 1813 Major Ballantyne entered into engagements with all the Mahi Kantha tributaries, and although by some unaccountable mistake, those terms were never either confirmed to, or formally annulled, the chiefs have submitted quietly to the arbitrary proceedings of the Gaikwar's officers. During the ensuing period, the Mahi Kantha was entrusted to Bacha Jamadar, who maintained a\nconsiderable force and kept up the Gaikwar's authority with tolerable energy. He greatly increased the pecuniary payments of the chiefs, and he chastised any villages that went into open rebellion; but he was not successful in preventing depredations, and the complaints from our districts of the outrages of the Kolis were loud and frequent. In 1818 the bulk of Bacha's force was called off on foreign service, and the whole was afterwards withdrawn. The alterations made by this measure seems (although I have formerly stated it otherwise) to have been rather unfavourable to the tranquillity of the district. But the attack on Lohar and the judicious steps afterwards taken for obtaining securities established a degree of order not known since the days of Sivram. The absence of all troops and of everything like a representative of government have since admitted of a renewal of former disorders, but it is rather surprising that the confusion should not in such circumstances have been universal than that it should, to a certain extent, have occurred.\n\nThe Mahi Kanta force used to canton during the rains wherever its presence seemed most required, but for the whole of the remaining eight months of the year it was constantly in motion. When the tribute was not paid on demand, mohosal (or horseman entitled to levy a fixed sum every day) was despatched to the chief. If that was not effectual, the force moved to his lands; when, if the presence of such undisciplined visitors did not by its own inconvenience bring him into terms, they proceeded to cut down his crop, spoil his trees, and waste his lands. These measures were generally rendered necessary by the imposition of some additions to the tribute, but many villages also made it a point of honour not to pay unless a force came against them. In cases of extreme obstinacy in refusing the tribute, or in committing or encouraging depredations, the Gaikwar officer entered on open hostilities, when he generally endeavoured by a forced march to surprise the Mehvasis in their villages, and seize their Thakor or their women. If he succeeded, the Mehvasis submitted, but if he failed, he burnt the village, and the people (especially if they were Kolis) retired to the jungle and set his attacks at defiance. The strongest Koli villages are open on the side furthest from the river, and their only object seems to be to secure a retreat to the ravines. The facilities afforded by these recesses, whether for flight or concealment, inspire the Kolis with the greatest confidence, while the roads leading along the exposed ridges are by no means equally encouraging to the assailants. In such places the Kolis with their bows and matchlocks would often keep the Gaikwar troops for a long time at bay; but if they were dislodged, they scattered and by long and rapid marches united again at a concerted point beyond the reach of their enemies. In the meantime, they sometimes attempted night attacks on the camp, in which the suddenness of their onset often struck a panic into the undisciplined troops opposed to them; but they more frequently avoided the enemy, and annoyed him indirectly by the depredations they committed on the villages in which he was interested. In the meantime the Gaikwar chief endeavoured to obtain intelligence and to cut up the Kolis or seize their families. He also tried by all means to prevent their receiving provisions, and fined and otherwise punished all who supported them. If this were successful, the Kolis would subsist for a long time on the flowers of the mahuda tree and on other esculent plants. But in time the bulk of their followers would fall off and return to their villages, while the chief, with the most determined of his adherents, remained in the jungle, and, either was neglected, or easily eluded the pursuit of the Marathas until he could, by some compromise or even by submission, be restored to his village. There are many instances in which quarrels\nAppendix A.\n\nMr. Elphinstone's Minute.\n1821.\n\nwith Kolis have terminated still less favourably to the Gaikwar. The village of Amballa, though on one side only defended by a narrow strip of jungle and a hedge of dry thorns, stood a siege of six months against a body of 7000 men. The village was then carried by assault, but a part of the Kolis rallied, and the besiegers fled with the utmost precipitation, leaving their guns and four of their principal chiefs on the field. On another occasion the inhabitants of Lohar, about 1000 strong, enticed a Gaikwar force of 10,000 men through a long defile into the bed of the Vatrak, and while a small party made a show of resistance on the opposite bank, an ambuscade started upon and opened a fire on the rear in the defile. The whole army immediately took to flight, and Babaji, who commanded it, with difficulty escaped by the swiftness of his horse.\n\nWhen the affair was with Rajputs, they almost always defended their village, and that of Varsoda situated among strong ravines on the Sabarmati once beat off several assaults of the Gaikwar troops, and compelled them to raise the siege. The Rajputs sometimes (though rarely) hired foreign mercenaries and often called in Kolis; but the Kolis never had recourse to the assistance of any other tribe.\n\nWhatever was the nature of the adjustment between the Government and a Mehwasi chief, it was of no avail unless securities were given by the latter. The securities were a Bh\u00e1t and a neighbouring chief. The first enforced the agreement in the last extremity by killing or maiming himself or some of his relations, the other by private war. These means could not be permitted now, but shame must have great hold in both cases. The influence of the securities must be useful in keeping their principal to his duty, and the chief may be of use in operations by his intelligence and his knowledge of the country. Under the Gaikwar, the security was liable to fine, imprisonment and other hardship in which indeed the essence of the system appears to consist. To prevent the security being nugatory, it is necessary that some penalty should be imposed on the person who undertakes it, and it is equally necessary that Government should be vigilant and trace offences to the village which commits them. The perpetrators may often be few, and may easily escape by the connivance of the chief, or a band of twenty or thirty men of different villages may sometimes assemble in the jungle, and become formidable banditti over whom it is difficult to establish any control. These are the sort of offenders against whom a settlement if once made it will be most necessary to guard. As to the chiefs, if care be taken that all give security, it will only be necessary to avoid encroaching on their rights, it being almost unknown for a chief to enter on unprovoked resistance to Government after he has once given security.\n\nIn explaining the present state of the Mahi Kantha and the events to which we are now to apply a remedy, it is necessary to advert to two omissions on the part of our own officers; the first is the disregard of Major Ballantyne's engagements, and the second, the long interval that has been allowed to elapse since the transfer of the Gaikwar's authority to the Company, without any assumption on the part of the British Government of the superintendence of the district. I have called on the Resident at Baroda to explain the cause of those omissions, and I have now only to state their effects.\n\nAlmost all the chiefs I have met with have complained of the exactions of the Bacha Jamadar, which sometimes amounted to double the amount settled by Major Ballantyne. The addition was levied under some other name, but it was not the less an increase to the tributes. These chiefs, indeed, were few in number, but I have every reason to think\nthe grievance general. Complaints were also made on all hands of the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r government abetting encroachments by one chief on another, or at least of its failing to restrain such encroachments, and neglecting to repress the depredations of the Kolis and other Mehv\u00e1sis residing both within its immediate districts and in the tributary country.\n\nThis last evil has greatly increased during the interregnum that has been allowed to take place since the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r withdrew from the management of the Mahi K\u00e1ntha, during which time the chiefs have been left to their own management without any common head to refer to. In consequence, their quarrels have run from verbal discussions to petty wars, and the predatory villages, invited by the unsettled state of the neighbourhood, have commenced depredations on all around. The disputes between the P\u00e1t\u00e1vat of Titui and the R\u00e1ja of Idar is the chief of the quarrels above alluded to. Both parties levied troops and both were guilty of exactions in the country through which they passed. But on an accommodation between the parties, the R\u00e1ja withdrew his troops without difficulty, while those of the Titui chief remained in a state of real or pretended insubordination, making incursions into the Dungarpur country, that of the R\u00e1ja of Ahmednagar, and of various petty chiefs, and threatening the nearest even of the Company's districts. His mercenaries amount to 700, of whom 200 or 300 are Arabs.\n\nThe Mehv\u00e1si villages now active in plundering are scattered over nearly the whole of the Mahi K\u00e1ntha, Ganjun, Bakrol\u00ed, and some others plunder the north-east of the Mod\u00e1sa sub-division, pargana, as does Amodr\u00e1 in the B\u00e1yad pargana, while Antrol\u00ed in Harsool and Ruparel in Par\u00e1nt\u00edj are both in a state of rebellion against the Company as well as the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r. Anoria, a village of the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r's in the Bij\u00f3pur pargana, plunders the Company's territory as those of Kuberpur and Chaubla in Vadnagar do that of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Idar and Ahmednagar. B\u00e1la Mia also of Bhujpura in the south-east is openly plundering the country, and those disorders, which have increased rapidly within these few months, would soon become universal if prompt measures were not taken to repress them. With this view I have directed Captain Miles to repair to Mod\u00e1sa and endeavour to put a stop to these irregularities, as far as can be done by remonstrance. I have left a party of fifty men from my escort at Mod\u00e1sa, to afford some little protection to that part of the Company's territory, and I have directed a detachment of 700 N.I. with a gun, and 200 G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r horse to assemble at the same place to support Captain Miles. I do not think this detachment sufficient to settle the whole country, and if I had the means I would send such a detachment as that now in K\u00e1thi\u00e1war to obtain securities from the chiefs, and to hunt down any who might obstinately persevere in their depredations. But the present detachment, if it can be formed at all, will be formed with great difficulty, and I hope it will check the pressing evils. Captain Miles will be able to judge whether it will enable him to obtain the securities, and if a further force is found necessary, it can be sent after the rains when the crops are on the ground, which is always the best time for settling with Mehv\u00e1sis.\n\nThe principle of the settlement ought to be to take security for ten years for the payment of the tribute settled by Major Ballantyne, and for the observance of our engagements. The principal articles of which should be as follows:\n\n1. To abstain from plundering.\n2. To give up plunderers and others guilty of offences in the territory of the Government or of any other chief.\n3. The chiefs to employ their whole means to resist and destroy\n\nAppendix A.\nMr. Elphinstone's Minute.\n1821.\n\nPlan for the future.\nAppendix A.\n\nMr. Elphinstone's Minute.\n1821.\n\nplunderers; to give no succour to any person in opposition to the authority of the British Government or the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r, and to use every exertion to cut off his supplies, and to apprehend him.\n\n4. To abstain from private war and from maintaining foreign mercenaries.\n\n5. To refer all disputes to the arbitration of the British Government.\n\n6. To protect the passage of merchants and (if the chief can be persuaded to accede to it) to accept of a compensation for the privilege of levying transit duties.\n\n7. To prevent illicit trade in opium.\n\nBesides these general arrangements, there are many particular ones applicable to each chief.\n\nThe relation between the R\u00e1ja of Idar and his relations and Pat\u00edvats, the Pat\u00edvats of the former R\u00e1os, and the Koli chiefs with his territory should be fixed with precision. Where it is consistent with established practice, the R\u00e1ja's authority should be restored to such an extent as to enable him to call out the contingents of his Pat\u00edvats, and maintain order without the direct interference of the British Government; on the other hand, where the practice does not admit of his exercising such a degree of authority, the British Government must make effectual arrangements on its own part for preventing disorders being committed by the chiefs.\n\nMany of the Mahi K\u00e1ntha chiefs are entitled to pecuniary collections, gir\u00e1s, in the Company's and G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r's districts. The amount of these should be fixed, and means taken to provide for the payment in such a manner as to prevent the clashing of authorities, without injuring the chief by converting his territorial right into a pecuniary pension from Government. A mode, consistent with the practice of the country, would be to allow the collection to be made by the Bh\u00e1t, who is security for the chief assisted, if necessary, by the Collector's officers.\n\nSome of those chiefs (especially the R\u00e1ja of Idar) have similar claims on each other which should be settled with equal precision, and a mode of payment fixed on that may prevent disagreement. In many cases it might be practicable for the British Government to make the collection, and admit the money received in part payment of the gh\u00e1sd\u00e1na. The amount might perhaps, in most cases, be fixed on an average of the last ten or fifteen years' payments.\n\nIncluding those of the R\u00e1ja of Idar's dependents, who used to settle with the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r separately from him, there are 121 chiefs in the Mahi K\u00e1ntha with whom Major Ballantyne made settlement. Of these sixty-three pay jam\u00e1bandi to the Company, and are included in the eye of our regulations in the districts of Kaira and Ahmedabad, and twenty-four pay jam\u00e1bandi to different kam\u00e1visd\u00e1rs of the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r.\n\nIt would simplify our transactions if the chiefs within our districts were to pay their gh\u00e1sd\u00e1na through the Collector. The question also arises regarding the persons, whether it is consistent with justice and sound policy to subject them to the direct interference of our courts and to the ordinary regulations of our government, or whether it would be expedient to place them on some other footing, if such can be found, that should secure the quiet of our own districts without diminishing the independence of the tributaries. I shall endeavour to examine this question on my progress through the Company's districts.\n\nWith respect to the twenty-four that pay jam\u00e1bandi to the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r, it is indispensable that the amount of that tribute should be fixed, or our\nguarantee of the fixed rate of gh\u00e1sd\u00e1na will be nugatory. The G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r may perhaps be persuaded to acquiesce in this on our engaging to assist his officers in recovering their jam\u00e1bandi, but the negotiation would not be without difficulty, as it is the constant practice of the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r government to increase the jam\u00e1bandi whenever an opportunity offers. Should the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r refuse to accede, I see no course but to make over the whole management of those villages to His Highness, without our participation or guarantee.\n\nThere are at present a vast number of unsettled disputes between the chiefs, which might be adjusted by the Political Agent, through the means of panchayats. I do not think it would be found convenient to make the present state of possession permanent, as was done in K\u00e1thi\u00e1war. The Political Agent might, however, endeavour in all cases, where the right of the claimant was at all doubtful, to persuade him to acquiesce in the actual state of possession or to come to some compromise with the occupant.\n\nThe particular relation of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da to Sindia will render it necessary for Major Ballantyne to abstain, for the present, from all interference with that petty state, for the tribute of which he should apply to Captain MacDonald, but should be called on for a full account of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da and the progress of its connection with the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r state. These are all the points which at present occur to me as requiring notice, but the full accounts we may hereafter expect will doubtless suggest many more.\n\nUntil all pending questions are finally settled, it will be necessary for the Political Agent to move about the country, and it may be necessary for the troops to remain there also; but when affairs are once put into a regular train, the Political Agent may take up a fixed station, and it should, I conceive, be towards the south at an equal distance from the eastern and western extremities of the district. It is desirable that the R\u00e1ja of Id\u00e1r should be left to the exercise of his own authority, and on the other hand, the Kolis bordering on our districts require constant vigilance to repress their depredations. Very great attention and judgment will always be necessary to unite that vigilance with an abstinence from the opposite fault of over-interference, which often serves only to destroy the established authority, without setting up any thing equally efficacious in its place.\n\nThe utmost personal attention will also be necessary among so many chiefs, who have all disputes with their neighbours, to prevent native agents from fostering a litigious spirit, and producing irritation by corruption and partiality. For this and other reasons I think it impossible for the same officer to undertake the management of the Mahi K\u00e1ntha and of K\u00e1thi\u00e1war. I propose, therefore, that the whole duty of the latter province should be made over to Captain Barnowall, whose allowances may be increased to those of a Collector, which, indeed, they ought to be on the principle on which they were first fixed. Major Ballantyne may then give up his whole attention to the Mahi K\u00e1ntha, and it may be practicable at some future period to unite his office with that of the Political Agent at P\u00e1l\u00e1npur, unless the duties of the latter should be increased by the management of the Jodhpur tributaries.\n\nThe troops ought not, I conceive, to remain in the country after it is once settled, but prompt measures should be adopted from time to time to send detachments from Deesa, Kaira and Baroda, to make examples like that of Lohar, which never fail to make a strong and lasting impression, and which are the more effectual because the tributaries never know when they are safe from them. Whereas if a battalion were\nstationed in the country, any circumstance that called it off to foreign service would be the signal for general depredation and disorder. It is not necessary or expedient to employ regular troops against small parties of banditti on the roads. These would be put down by the irregular under the revenue officers, and by the people of the country which will always succeed, if great attention be paid to prevent any relaxation in their exertions. These means will, I think, be very effectual in establishing the tranquillity of the Mahi K\u00e1ntha, which, from its contiguity to our own districts, is of much greater consequence than that of K\u00e1thi\u00e1war or any other tributary state.\n\nIn the course of events, it may, I think, be expected that the southern parts of the Mahi K\u00e1ntha will at no distant period be turned into a quiet and submissive country. The long continuance of tranquillity will turn the attention of the Kolis to agriculture, and their predatory habits and their jungles will disappear together. If the progress of civilization be less rapid in the strong country on the frontier, it is a satisfaction to reflect that the nature of those fastnesses and the character of their defenders are a protection to the peaceful inhabitants of the plains, and that they have hitherto afforded an effectual barrier against the hordes of freebooters, who have so long ravaged the neighbouring provinces of Hindust\u00e1n.\n\nThe principality of P\u00e1l\u00e1npur is included in the Mahi K\u00e1ntha settlement, and pays gh\u00e1sd\u00e1na to the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r, but it could not be comprised in a general description with the other communities, from which it differs so much in all respects. It has owed its independence more to distance than the natural strength, the country being in most parts open and easy of access. It is naturally not unfertile, and though it has felt the effects of the famine which was so severe in Cutch, K\u00e1thi\u00e1war and on the north-western frontier, it has suffered less than its western neighbours. It seems tolerably well governed and appears to be prosperous. The town of P\u00e1l\u00e1npur is reckoned to contain about 20,000 inhabitants. The Diw\u00e1n's revenue is somewhat less than three lakhs of rupees, but this is charged with a tribute of Rs. 50,000 (\u00a35000), a subsidy of Rs. 81,600 (\u00a38160) to the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r, &c. His military force amounts to 300 horse and 500 foot in which are included 150 horse and 100 foot subsidized from the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r. His debts amount to Rs. 40,000 (\u00a34000).\n\nThe family of the Diw\u00e1n have had possession of P\u00e1l\u00e1npur for many generations. About twenty-seven years ago, the state fell into the hands of a rebellious soldiery, who expelled the lawful Diw\u00e1n, set np first his relation Shamshir Kh\u00e1n, the chief of Deesa, and next Firuz Kh\u00e1n. They afterwards murdered Firuz Kh\u00e1n, and recalled Shamshir Kh\u00e1n from Deesa, to which place he had retired. Shamshir Kh\u00e1n was emancipated from the control of the soldiery, and established as guardian to Fateh Kh\u00e1n, the son of Firuz Kh\u00e1n, by a British force acting on the part of the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r (in 1809), but having afterwards failed to pay his tribute, he was removed by another in 1817, and the exercise of the government was entrusted to Fateh Kh\u00e1n under the superintendence of Captain Miles, the British Political Agent. At this time the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r's subsidy was imposed. It serves to pay the salary of the Political Agent which is Rs. 6000 (\u00a3600) a year, and the horse and foot already specified. This arrangement answers well at present. The subsidized troops are entirely at the disposal of the Political Agent, whose supervision of the Diw\u00e1n's expenses is certainly beneficial. But without the control of the Political Agent, the present plan would probably end either in the rebellion of the Diw\u00e1n, or in his being swallowed up by the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r. Should his debts not disappear under the expected improvement of his\ncountry, it may be questioned whether he will not be relieved from part of his subsidiary arrangements with the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r, which ought to be proportioned to the means of his principality.\n\nThe Diw\u00e1n has no foreign connections. He corresponds with the neighbouring petty states with whom he formerly kept up mutual incursions. His territory has occasionally and even very lately suffered by the depredations of the Jodhpur armies levying tribute in his neighbourhood; but he has never paid anything to that government.\n\nThe appointment of a separate Political Agent at P\u00e1lanpur prevents its being included in the Mahi K\u00e1ntha settlement, and renders inapplicable to it almost all the plans that have been proposed for the rest of that division.\n\nSteps have already been taken to ascertain the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r's right to gh\u00e1sd\u00e1n\u00e1s within the Peshwa's districts adjoining the Mahi K\u00e1ntha. I shall make no observations on them here except that, as the disputed items are all included in the list of tributaries settled with by Major Ballantyne, it will be necessary that that officer be expressly directed to forbear making any demand on them, until the questions now under discussion shall have been determined.\nINDEX.\n\nA.\n\nAbdasa : sub-division, 2, 131, 138, 146.\nAboti : a Br\u00e1hman sub-division, 47.\n\u00c1desar : place of interest, 210.\nAdhoi : place of interest, 210.\nAdministrative Sub-divisions : see Sub-divisions.\nAge : population according to, 42.\nAgricultural stock : 370.\nAgriculture : C. 104-109 ; P. 298-296 ; M.
