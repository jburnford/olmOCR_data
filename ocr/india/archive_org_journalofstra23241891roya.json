N. RIDLEY, M.A., F.L.S.\n\nIn publishing this list of the Grasses and Sedges of the Peninsula (Gramineae and Cyperaceae), I am well aware that it is by no means complete. From many parts of the Peninsula we have no specimens of these families, and especially is this the case as regards the great mountain region which traverses the Peninsula. From the uplands we shall doubtless procure many interesting kinds when the country is more opened up, and from the northern parts of the Peninsula bordering on Siam we may expect to obtain many Assam and Burmese species not yet met with. This list rather represents the lowland glumaceous flora of the South.\n\nA country which like this is covered with dense forest for the greater part is, as a rule, poorly provided with grasses and sedges, for few of these plants occur in high forest. Yet on the whole there is a considerable variety, and among them not a few very interesting and curious plants are to be met with.\n\nI am much indebted to Professor Hackel of St. Polten for identifying many of the grasses, and to Mr. C. B. Clarke for much assistance in the matter of Cyperaceae.\n\nHabitats.\u2014The most productive localities for grasses and sedges are the damp low swamps and rice-fields, the banks of streams and the sandy shores of rivers and seas. The open country where the jungle has been cleared and secondary forest is returning is very barren of plants of interest, although large tracts are covered with glumaceous plants. Imperata, Isch\u00e6mum, Paspalum, Panicum of the Digitaria\nsection form the bulk of the grass flora here, while the Cyperaceae are represented by a few common Sclerias, Rhynchospora Wallichii and Fimbristylis. The low swampy ground and rice-fields are rich in the genera Panicum, Isachne, Leersia, Scirpus, Rhynchospora, Scleria, Heleocharis and Cyperus. Along the streams and rivers some fine species may be met with, among which Scleria oryzoides, Scirpus grossus and Sc. mucronatus, Lepironia, many Cyperi, the common reed Phragmites Roxburghii, and the wild sugar-cane Saccharum arundinaceum and S. Ridleyi are very conspicuous; the last three grasses forming huge thickets in many places. The Sclerias, too\u2014Scl. malaccensis and Scl. oryzoides\u2014often cover large tracts of wet open land, forming jungles about six feet high, very laborious to traverse. In the dense forests the glumaceous plants almost disappear, yet there are several very interesting genera to be met with. The large group of Hypolytre\u00e6 is well represented here by many species of Mapania and Pandanophyllum. The latter of which, as the name denotes, so much resemble the smaller species of screw-pines that, unless the inflorescence is found, they may be easily mistaken for them. Grasses are almost unrepresented in the deep jungle. Centotheca lappacea and Lophatherum, however, sometimes find their way far in, being transported widely by their very adherent spikelets attaching themselves to wild beasts. In many places, too, there are large tracts of bamboos, but at present specimens of these in flower have rarely been met with, so that of what species they are is not yet known.\n\nOn the sandy districts by the sea and along the river banks, a large number of species are to be met with, and among them several very striking plants. Such are the Porcupine grass (Spinifex), Thouarea, a curious creeping grass, Sch\u0153nus calostachyus, Poir, two species of Eriachne, Gahnia, Lepturus, Tricostularia and many other species worthy of cultivation.\n\nSome of our native grasses are worthy of cultivation as ornamental plants, among these the Saccharums and Phragmites form large tufts like those of Pampas grass. The Pandanophylla and Mapani\u00e6 are fine foliage plants suited for pot culture, and Pogonatherum and Fimbristylis monophylla with\ntheir fine leaves and stems also make elegant pot plants for mingling with those of larger foliage.\n\nThe larger *Andropogons*\u2014*A. citratus*, *A. nardus* and *A. muricatus*\u2014are cultivated for their sweet scent; the first producing the well known lemon grass oil, the second citronella. Of other grasses of economic value, it is only necessary to mention rice (*Oryza sativa*), sugar-cane (*Saccharum officinarum*), millet (*Sorgum vulgare* and *S. saccharatum*), and the numerous species of bamboos cultivated here.\n\nThe plumed seeds of *Imperata arundinacea* are used by the Malays to stuff pillows; of the stem of *Scirpus grossus* and *Lepironia mucronata* they make mats, and walking sticks are made from *Thysanol\u00e6na* in Sungei Ujong. A kind of beer was at one time made from the rhizomes of Lalang, which contain a good deal of sugar. The manufacture was not remunerative and was soon given up.\n\nThe grasses and sedges which form the greater part of the turf here are *Andropogon acicularis*, *Cynodon dactylon*, *Isch\u00e6mum ciliare*, besides which, in some places *Fimbristylis monophylla*, *F. tenera* and *F. communis* form a considerable portion. I have seen a lawn almost entirely composed of *Zoysia pungens*, a soft inland form. It makes a very deep soft turf, but is unsuitable for tennis lawns, except in dry places, where it becomes short and compact. For sandy places *Andropogon aciculare* and *Cynodon dactylon* are best. Where the soil is better the *Isch\u00e6mums* form a better class of turf. The best native fodder grass here is unquestionably *Isch\u00e6mum muticum*; *I. ciliare* and *I. timorense* are also very good. *Panicum jumentorum*, the Guinea grass, has been introduced as a fodder plant, but must be used with caution, as horses have been killed by overfeeding with it.\n\n**Distribution.**\u2014A large number of the glumaceous plants of the Peninsula are very widely distributed throughout the Indo-Malayan region. A few are cosmopolitan, occurring in all parts of the world that are warm enough for them; such are *Cyperus polystachyus*, *C. rotundus*, *C. distans*, and *Fimbristylis communis* among *Cyperace\u00e6*; *Cynodon dactylon*, *Digitaria sanguinale*, *Eleusine indica* among grasses. A\nsmall number of sea-shore plants have an Australian facies; such are *Schoenus calostachyus*, *Fimbristylis sericea*, *Spinifex squarrosus*, *Lepturus repens*. With them occur also such Australian forms as *Casuarina equisetfolia*, *Leucopogon*, *Dianella*, *Melaleuca* and *Philydrum* in the lowlands near the sea; and on the mountains of the interior we also meet with *Boeckia*, *Leptospermum*, *Cryptostylis*, *Corysanthes* and *Dacrydium*. All these are to be found also in the Malayan Archipelago, and a few, e.g., *Dianella*, *Cryptostylis*, *Spinifex* and the *Lepturus* as far West as Ceylon. This seems to indicate a wave of Australian immigrants westwards, some of which, such as *Casuarina* and the grasses, at least were brought by sea-currents along the island shores.\n\nThere are two grasses which are certainly of American origin, viz., *Chloris barbata* and *Paspalum conjugatum*. The latter is very common in the cultivated districts, but seems to disappear in the interior. In Penang, are two Indian grasses which do not appear in the South of the Peninsula, viz., *Thysanolaena acarifera*, Nees, which is typically Burmese, and *Eragrostis Wightiana*, a rare grass only known in the mouth of the Hooghly and in one place in Ceylon.\n\n**Native names.**\u2014Such native names as I have been able to find I have inserted. The derivations or translations are only suggested. It is often very difficult to get at the idea of a Malay when he names a plant, so many of the names are absurd and apparently meaningless.\n\nThe common name for grass is \"Rumput,\" but this means also almost any small plant, such as Rumput Kra-Nas, Ape's rice grass, *Vandellia crustacea*. \"Senderaian\" is a general name for *Cyperi* and *Sclerias*.\n\n**CYPERUS.**\n\n*C. pumilus*, Linn.

It is much less common than the typical C. Griffithii with flat spikelets, but occurs mixed with it, at Pekan. There is also a dwarf form with very short stem, having the lower spikelets almost buried in the sand, and I met also with a curious flaccid form with long grassy leaves, and the glumes almost, or indeed in some specimens quite, foliace-\nous.

Far too common in the Peninsula wherever cultivation has spread, and often covering large tracts of country. Its growth after burning of the forests is remarkably rapid, as it propagates itself by its feathery seeds, as well as by its\nrhizome. A large tract covered with the plant in fruit looks from a distance as if it were covered with snow. It seems to prefer hot and dry places, but dislikes wet or very sandy soil. In the first, its place is taken by *Scleria malaccensis* and other such plants, in the latter by *Bracken* (*Pteris aquilina*, L.) or *Gleichenia*. It is a grass of very little use, as cattle and horses do not care for it on account of its hardness. Pigs, however, are very fond of the young shoots. Attempts have been made to use it for paper making, but without much success, and a kind of beer is sometimes made from the rhizomes. The plumed seeds are sometimes used to stuff pillows. It is very common in Singapore, Johor, Penang, Malacca, Province Wellesley and Selangor, but seems to be rarer in the less cultivated districts, and notably in Tringganu, Pahang and Kelantan.\n\n*SACCHARUM.*\n\n*S. arundinaceum*, Retz.

It is nearly impossible to identify a bamboo out of flower, and, as is well known, it is by no means common to find plants in flower. So that it is almost a rule among tropical botanists that whenever a bamboo is seen to be in flower specimens must be collected. There are large extents of bamboos in many parts of the Peninsula, but of what species is not yet known. I met with a large patch of a species of Dendrocalamus in Bukit Kuda near Klang, of which every joint was full of most excellent water, even the twigs being full though the ground beneath was remarkably dry.

The magnificent plants in Peradeniya Gardens, Ceylon, are well known to every visitor there.

M. MEREWETHER.\n\nIn the following brief account of the Dindings, I do not pretend to place before the readers of this Journal much that is new. I have merely endeavoured to put together in a connected form as much of the History of the Dindings as I have been able to gather from the sources at my disposal, in the hope that it may be of some interest to those who only know the Dindings by name. For the History of the Dutch Occupation of Pangkor, I am indebted to Mr. W. E. MAXWELL'S article on the Dutch in Perak, published in Vol. No. 10 of this Journal, and to his Note on the same subject in Vol. No. 11.\n\nThe earliest mention of the Dindings is found in a letter from the Governor-General and Board of Administration of the United East India Company, dated 1st October, 1661, discovered among the Dutch records in Malacca, in which an order is given to cut 200 pieces of a certain red wood at Pulau Dinding (Pangkor) to be sent to \"Patria\" (Holland). From this it may be assumed that the Island became known to the Dutch before that date, probably when they established their factory in Perak in 1650, which was cut off in 1651.\n\nTwo years later, on the 29th November, 1663, an old Dutch navigator named WOUTER SCHOUTEN visited Pulau Dinding on his way to Bengal, and wrote an account of his voyage, from which I take the following extracts:\n\n\"On the 25th November in the evening sighted Malacka for the second time, and advanced four miles with the land\nwind; then anchored, waiting for daybreak; weather now lovely. Sunshine and a temperate sky with a following breeze with which we set sail and passed the green, rocky mountains of Cape Ressados (Rachado?), steering now South-West for some hours, and then North to fetch above the dangerous reef of Poelo Parselar. Coming under the green coast of the kingdom of Pera, we sighted the Poelo Sambilan or Nine Islands, which having passed, we headed for the island of Dingding, and arrived on the 29th November in the Roadstead between that Island and the mainland of Pera, close to the Watering-place.\n\n\"Having reached the neighbourhood of the Watering-place on the inner side of the Island Dinding above-mentioned, we immediately sent a good party of sailors to the coast of Pera opposite to procure firewood for our further voyage to Bengal. The others went to Poelo Dinding to fetch fresh water from one of the principal Rivers of the island, and we, not to be idle, went also on shore with a line of 80 fathoms and brought up fish out of the Gulfs and Bays of the Island Dinding, going on board in the evening with a good haul of all sorts of well-flavoured, delicate fish.\n\n\"In the same way, on the next day, the 30th November, our people still being engaged in fetching water and firewood, we roamed all about and visited all parts of the Island Dinding, taking at last a good haul; we remained on shore all night with our Sub-Merchant ABRAHAM DE WIJS and others in the same way inclined and there we enjoyed our catch...........\n\n\"The Island Dinding, about 30 miles to the North-West of Malacka, is uninhabited, full of high Mountains, vast Forests and very deadful Wildernesses. The sea coast is here and there covered with terrible large Rocks and overhanging Cliffs, which are overgrown in a wonderful way with Verdure and Underwood, and some with very high Trees, so that one cannot very well walk round the Island along the beach...........The sweet water flowed down from the high woody Mountains between great ravines, making its way down to the Sea in numerous little Rivers, and we found it lovely, agreeable and clear. It is said that in Amboyna and on this Island Dinding\nthe best fresh water of the whole East Indies is found, and this I believe to be the fact, for I myself (in my own opinion) have never in any other country in India drunk better water than in these two places.\"\n\nHe goes on to relate how he and his friends \"heard in the wildernesses many Rattle-snakes,\" but they did not see any although they \"made search for these monsters.\" The Pangkor of to-day is very well provided in the matter of reptiles, but the rattlesnakes must have left the island when the Dutch did, for I have never heard of one being seen. What Schouten heard was probably the hamadryad (*Ophiophagus elaps*), which makes a peculiar noise, but not with its tail. He also mentions that they \"plucked the Oysters of the Trees,\" and gravely proceeds to explain how they got there, as \"this might seem to some people incredible.\"\n\nAfter a stay of five days, Wouter Schouten left Pangkor and proceeded on his voyage to Bengal on the 3rd December, but, meeting with bad weather immediately after leaving, he had to put back to refit, and left again finally the next day.\n\nTurning again to the Malacca records, we find a letter dated 5th August, 1670, in which orders are given to take possession of Pulau Dinding, and to build there a stronghold of wood; and another letter dated 31st October in the same year laying down that the garrison shall consist of 1 sergeant, 3 soldiers and 3 sailors. There is nothing to show when this order was carried out, but Dampier, who visited Pangkor 19 years later, found there \"a Governour and about 20 or 30 soldiers\" and a fort of stone (brick?). Besides the fort, the Governor had a house about a hundred yards away, where he used to spend the day, but he never trusted himself outside the fort at night on account of the hostility of the Malays, who, as Valentyn says of Perak Malays generally, were, \"very foul and murderous.\" The Perak Malays seem to have had a bad reputation from the earliest times. Hamilton, alluding to the \"cutting off\" of the Dutch factory in Perak in 1651, remarks that \"the inhabitants are so treacherous, faithless and bloody that no European nation can keep factories there;\" and, speaking of \"Selangore\" and \"Parsalore,\" he observes that\nthe inhabitants \"have too many of the Perak qualities to be trusted with honest men's lives and money.\"\n\nDampier gives an interesting description of the fort and the Governor's house as he found them. The ruins of the former still exist, and, though they are in a very tumble-down condition, it is easy to see how accurate Dampier's description was; but no trace remains of the house, which was built of timber.\n\nHe also gives a most amusing account of an entertainment given by the Governor to Captain Minchin and a Mr. and Mrs. Richards who were on board his ship. They went ashore in the afternoon to call on the Governor, and Captain Minchin treated him to brandy-punch, in return for which the Governor sent out a boat to catch some fresh fish, as an addition to the other fare of the fort, and invited them to \"supper.\" The boat came back about 5 o'clock, the fish was cooked at once, a fresh bowl of punch was brewed, and the Governor sat down with his guests and the officers from the fort prepared to do ample justice to this good cheer. But hardly had they fallen to, when one of the soldiers raised an alarm of \"Malayans,\" which produced a most remarkable effect on the Dutch section of the party. The Governor, without saying a single word, leapt through a window and was off like a hare in the direction of the fort; the officers and servants followed suit with great promptitude; and the three guests were left behind in amazement \"at this sudden Consternation of the Governour and his people.\" They followed, however, to the fort, where they found the Governor (possibly rather ashamed of his precipitate flight now that he was in safe quarters) waiting to receive them. The door was then shut, and the soldiers proceeded to fire the guns to show the \"Malayans\" that they were ready for them, but no attack was made, and their alarm must have given way to a feeling of regret at the loss of the supper and the punch which they had left behind. It is noticeable that Dampier, in common with other early voyagers, speaks of the excellence of the harbour at Pangkor, and also of the timber. Of the latter he says \"the Trees are of divers sorts, many of which are good\ntimber, and large enough for any Use. Here are also some good for Masts and Yards, they being naturally light yet tough and serviceable.\"\n\nIn 1690, one year after Dampier's visit, the Dutch garrison at Pangkor was \"cut off\" by the Malays under one Panglima Kulup; and in 1693 an order was given that, in consequence of this massacre, no garrison should be posted again at Pulau Dinding, but that a stone pillar should be erected there, having on one side the arms of the United East India Company, and on the other those of the United Provinces.\n\nThe pillar above-mentioned seems to have been erected, and either to have fallen down or to have been pulled down by the Malays, probably the latter, for in a letter dated 8th August, 1695, an order is given to re-erect it and to clean it yearly and keep it in repair.\n\nHaving thus set up a monument of their occupation\u2014and abandonment\u2014of Pangkor, the Dutch seem to have left the place alone for a period of 50 years. In 1745, however, an order was given to build again a small fort at Pulau Dinding, and to put there a garrison of 30 European and the same number of native soldiers, but no Bugis. This order was apparently carried out, but the occupation did not last long, for in 1748 an order was given to remove the garrison on account of the insalubrity of the place, and to send them to Perak. Thus ended the Dutch occupation of Pangkor.\n\nHow long the stone pillar referred to above was maintained, it is impossible to say; but it may be inferred that some difficulty was found in doing so, for, before leaving Pangkor, the Dutch carved the arms of the United Provinces on a large granite boulder near the fort, which may be seen to this day. There are also traces of an inscription below the arms, but, with the exception of a stray letter here and there, it has been entirely effaced, partly by the action of time and weather, and partly by well-meant but injudicious attempts to clean the face of the rock.\n\nIn 1822 Pangkor was visited by Crawfurd, who found it uninhabited. Having read Dampier's description of the Dutch fort, he searched for it, and found it exactly as described. In\nhis account of Pangkor, Crawfurd specially notices the \"beautiful and safe harbour running North and South, and seemingly sheltered from every wind.\"\n\nWe now come to the British occupation of Pangkor. In 1826 that island, together with the Sembilan Islands, was ceded to the British by Perak, with a view to the suppression of piracy; but it does not appear that any use was made of the concession either at the time or for some years after.\n\nIn 1867, a Kedah Malay named Haji Mahomed Akib conceived the idea of settling at Pangkor, and applied to the Lieut.-Governor of Penang (Col. Man) for permission to do so. After some consultation, the authorities being at first doubtful whether it was British territory, he was allowed to settle; a concession of 100 orlongs of land was given to him; and in 1870 he was appointed Penghulu of Pangkor by Colonel (now Sir Archibald) Anson. He induced a few other people to join him, but most of them went away again, as Pangkor and Pulau Sembilan were in those days the favourite haunts of pirates, and frequent descents were made by them on the settlers, so that for the first few years Haji Mahomed Akib lived almost alone. How he arranged matters with the pirates I do not know, and I never succeeded in getting a satisfactory answer to this question from him; but they do not seem to have visited him as they did other people. I may add, however, that when the Government undertook the suppression of piracy in these waters in earnest, Haji Mahomed Akib rendered valuable assistance on several occasions.\n\nIn January, 1874, the Pangkor Treaty was signed, by which, in addition to Pangkor, a strip of territory on the mainland containing an area of about 200 square miles was ceded to the British Government, and the whole territory was called the Dindings. It was made a dependency of the Settlement of Penang, but it was arranged, as a matter of convenience, that it should be administered by the Resident of Perak, the Revenue and Expenditure being, of course, included in the Budget of the Colony.\n\nAfter the Pangkor Treaty, some Police were placed on the\nisland under a European Sergeant to assist the Penghulu in keeping order, and in March, 1875, Inspector Warne was sent to take charge of the Station. After remaining there six months, he was relieved by Inspector Cooper in September of the same year, and the latter was in charge till April, 1877, when Captain Lloyd, who was appointed Superintendent of the Dindings on the 29th March, took charge.\n\nOn the 26th October, 1878, after only eighteen months' service, Captain Lloyd was brutally murdered by some of the Chinese coolies from the Lumut Estate, who, being thrown out of employment, naturally turned to their favourite pastime of gang-robbery. The details of this crime are familiar to most people in the Straits, and I will not dwell on them here.\n\nAfter Captain Lloyd's murder, Mr. R. R. Bruce, then an Inspector in the Perak Police, was placed temporarily in charge of the Dindings. He was appointed Superintendent at the beginning of 1879, and continued to hold that post till 15th September, 1882, when he nearly lost his life under the following circumstances. One Haji Osman bin Hasan had gone \"amok\" at Telok Sera and wounded four boys, and had then been killed by the Penghulu and Assistant Penghulu. On going into the case, Mr. Bruce found that one Haji Hasan, who was then at Taiping, was required as a witness, and had him brought to Pangkor. On the 15th September, Mr. Bruce examined Haji Hasan in the old \"balei\" or court-house at Pangkor, Captain Lloyd's former residence. Haji Hasan knew nothing of the \"amok\" at Telok Sera, and at first Mr. Bruce did not tell him about it, but subsequently he did so. One of the boys who had been wounded was related to Haji Hasan, and the latter seemed much disturbed and put out by the news. He asked leave to go at once to Telok Sera and see the boy, but as he was not reported to be dangerously wounded, Mr. Bruce told Haji Hasan he could go as soon as the enquiry was finished. He said nothing further and seemed satisfied. Shortly afterwards Mr. Bruce and Inspector McKeon of the Perak Police adjourned to an inner room for breakfast. They had not been there long, when Inspector McKeon happened to look up,\nand saw Haji Hasan behind Mr. Bruce, who was sitting with his back to the door, with a \"golok\" in his hand, which he was just about to plunge into Mr. Bruce's left shoulder. Inspector McKeon sprang to his feet and seized Haji Hasan by the throat with one hand, while with the other he attempted to seize Haji Hasan's right hand in which he had the \"golok.\" He was only able, however, to alter the direction of the blow, and Mr. Bruce received a serious wound in the back, but he undoubtedly saved Mr. Bruce's life, for, had he been stabbed on the left shoulder as Haji Hasan intended to do, the wound must have been fatal. Inspector McKeon then had a severe struggle with Haji Hasan, in the course of which he received an ugly wound in the left forearm, but he eventually succeeded in wresting the \"golok\" from him, and getting him down in a corner, when the Police came to his assistance. This sudden attack on Mr. Bruce appears to have been quite unpremeditated. It is probable that the news of the \"amok\" at Telok Sera upset Haji Hasan's mental equilibrium and caused him to \"amok\" himself.\n\nMr. Bruce suffered a great deal from the effects of his wound, which obliged him to go to Europe for a change, and ultimately to resign his appointment.\n\nIn June, 1883, Mr. Urban Bruce was appointed Superintendent of the Dindings, and held that post till 23rd November, 1884, when he met his death through a most unfortunate accident in Penang, where he had gone to recruit his health after an attack of fever.\n\nOn his death Mr. A. T. Dew, of the Perak Government service, was appointed Acting Superintendent of the Dindings, and was confirmed in the appointment in May, 1886. He remained in charge of the district till July, 1886, when it was decided by the Government of the Colony to take the administration into its own hands, and an Officer of the Colonial service was placed in charge. By Ordinance XI of 1886, the territory and islands of the Dindings ceased to be a part of the Settlement of Penang and were made a dependency of the Settlement of Singapore. They have since been re-\ntransferred to the Settlement of Penang by Ordinance IX of 1890.\n\nAlthough the contemporary history of the Dindings only extends over a period of 17 years, it cannot be said to have been an uneventful one, as two out of the first four Superintendents met their deaths while holding the appointment, and a third was seriously wounded. It is to be hoped, however, that the tragic era has passed, and that a peaceful and prosperous future is in store for a district which, when developed, should be a valuable accession to the Colony.\n\nIn concluding this account, it may not be out of place to give a brief description of the district under notice. It consists of Pulau Pangkor, Pulau Sembilan (the Nine Islands), lying about 10 miles to the South of Pangkor, and the strip of territory on the mainland already alluded to, which is bounded on the North, East and South by Perak, and on the West by the sea. The northern boundary is 8 miles in length, the eastern 22 miles, and the southern 5 miles, while the length of coast line, roughly speaking, is between 25 and 30 miles. The area of this portion of the district is about 200 square miles. The island of Pulau Jarra, called by the Malays Pulau Temurah, is also a dependency of the Dindings. It is about half a mile long forming a rounded hill 500 feet high, in the middle of the Straits of Malacca, with 25 to 40 fathoms all round.\n\nIt has two rivers\u2014Sungei Bruas at the northern end, a narrow winding stream, which is a good deal used, nevertheless, for bringing down timber and jungle produce from the interior; and Sungei Dinding opposite Pangkor, which for about 15 miles from its mouth is a fine deep river, navigable for the largest vessels. At a place called Kota Siam it divides itself into three branches\u2014Sungei Kota Siam, Sungei Sigari and Sungei Raja Itam\u2014the latter of which is navigable for launches for some 5 or 6 miles above Kota Siam, or about 20 miles in all from the mouth. The late Penghulu, Haji MAHOMED AKIB, is fond of relating how he once piloted H. M. S. Iron Duke up to Kota Siam and back.\n\nAt Kota Siam there is an old earthwork which, the Malays\nsay, was once occupied by Siamese, who carried on a continual and lively warfare with the Malays under Raja Itam, whose fort is a little higher up the river, and has given the name to one of the branches.\n\nTwo causes have hitherto operated to prevent the river becoming the port of Perak, as it seems intended by nature to be\u2014(1) the fact that it is in British territory, and that the Government of Perak naturally wanted to have a port in their own State; and (2) the entire absence of communication between the river and the interior of Perak. The question of railway communication between the Dindings and Kinta recently engaged the attention of the Government, but has been shelved for the time being owing to the construction of a line from Telok Anson to Tapa.\n\nThe coast is bold, and in many places rocky, with fine, sandy beaches, presenting a marked contrast to the Perak coast on either side, of which mud-banks and mangrove swamps are the chief characteristics. A range of hills runs along the coast for nearly its entire length, and also for some distance along the North bank of the Dinding River, the highest point being at Telok Sera. I believe that the height of this point has never been ascertained, as it is not given in the Admiralty chart, which gives the heights of other points, but it cannot be less than 1,500 feet, and I should say is probably more. On the banks of the Dinding River, opposite Pangkor, there are three hills over 1,000 feet in height and several smaller ones. The soil is fertile and well suited to the cultivation of such products as tapioca, pepper, gambier, Liberian coffee, spices, &c. North of Telok Sera there is a considerable tract of fine, low, swampy land suitable for the cultivation of padi, and, I should say, of sugar also, though the latter has not yet been tried. Padi grows excellently there, and if all this land were to be brought under cultivation, a valuable rice crop might be produced.\n\nThe chief product of the district has, however, hitherto been timber, of which a considerable quantity must have been exported during the last ten or twelve years. The quantity exported in 1887 was, in round numbers, 2,200 tons. I know\nof at least one timber merchant in Penang who started on a very small scale on the Dindings some years ago, and who has made a large fortune out of timber. Steps are now being taken to establish forest reserves before all the best kinds of timber are exhausted, for although the district is a small one, it is the only part of the Colony in which there is any extent of forest left.\n\nTin is the only metal found in any quantity in the district. There are considerable deposits of alluvial tin in three or four places, and experts judge from the appearance of the ore, that it has not travelled far from the lodes. There being no hills outside the district nearer than the main Perak range, it is reasonable to conclude that the lodes are located in the hills at the foot of which the alluvial deposits are found.\n\nThe tin has not yet been worked by Europeans, nor, except on a very small scale, by natives, notwithstanding the great facilities that exist in the way of water-carrage. Before the collapse of the tin syndicate, there was every prospect of land being taken up in the Dindings by Chinese capitalists from Taiping (Perak), but the fall in the price of tin caused the scheme to fall through. Round about Telok Sera there are traces in many places of old workings (chiefly Lampau), which are said by the Malays to be of Siamese origin.\n\nGold has been found in small quantities at one or two places, and in Pangkor Island there is place which is still called Telok Klian Mas.\n\nThe island of Pangkor is about 12 miles long and 4 or 5 miles wide at the broadest part. It is very hilly, there being three peaks over 1,100 feet high and three over 700 feet. The highest point is 1,313 feet. These figures are taken from the Admiralty chart. There is not much level land, but the soil is good, and many of the smaller hills are well adapted for planting. The headquarters of the district were, till last year, situated on the East side of the island, where there is an excellent harbour, with deep water and well sheltered from all winds. It is well known for the abundance and excellence of the fish caught there, a large quantity of which is cured and exported. A few small steamers call occasion-\nally at Pangkor, but the bulk of the trade is carried on by native craft, chiefly Chinese.\n\nThe one drawback to this beautiful island is its unhealthiness. From the appointment of the first Superintendent up to the present time, the journals of the officers in charge have been one long record of sickness caused by the malarial fever which seems to have made Pangkor its home, and which spares no one. Judging from appearances, one would say that the island ought to be very healthy, and it is difficult to say what causes the fever. The late Rev. J. E. Tennison-Woods, who spent some weeks at Pangkor in 1884, attributed the unhealthiness of the place to the fish-curing which is carried on at Raja Bayang, the principal village of the island. He says: \"The effluvium around the village of Raja Byong was unbearable to those who had not been inured to it by previous education. Whenever the wind blew from the village towards our quarters, we had to leave the house. Our Chinese servants, in spite of every prohibition, spread their mats under the bungalow at night, and exposed themselves to the full force of these mephitic breezes. The consequence was that they were all stricken down with fever, and some nearly died. Pankore has the name of being a very unhealthy place, but the marvel is how anybody lives there at all. The inhabitants suffer much from what is called malarial fever, but the malaria here is undoubtedly mephitism from putrid fish offal.\" * This may be true as far as the village of Raja Bayang is concerned, but other parts of the island, where there is no fish-curing, are just as unhealthy, and the cause must, therefore, be sought elsewhere. It is probable that nothing but extensive clearing of the jungle will effect any improvement. The headquarters of the district were moved last year to Lumut at the mouth of the Dindings River, which it was hoped would be a healthier position, but the results of the move have not been very encouraging so far.\n\nThe group of islands called Pulau Sembilan lie about 10 miles to the South of Pangkor, opposite the mouth of the\n\n* Essay on the Fisheries of the Oriental Region, p. 27. The italics are mine.\u2014E. M. M.\nPerak River. They are uninhabited, except during the season when the turtles lay their eggs, when the person to whom the right of collecting the eggs is farmed places a few Malays there to see that no poaching takes place, and to collect the eggs. There is excellent water on one of the islands, and in dry weather the Malays from the mainland are very glad to avail themselves of this supply in spite of the distance they have to go for it. I have been told by Malays that there is a cave on one of the islands where edible birds' nests are to be found, but I could never find any one who could show me the entrance. One man said that when the pirates left the neighbourhood they closed up the entrance to the cave with a big stone. If the cave ever existed outside the imagination of the natives, it is probable that this statement is true.\nNATIVE NAMES OF STREETS IN SINGAPORE.\n\nACTING under the powers conferred by section 143 of the Municipal Ordinance 1887, the Commissioners have affixed at the corner of every street in the town of Singapore a board on which is inscribed \"the name by which such street shall be known.\" But, as most of the residents are aware, the names given by the Municipality to the various streets are only used by the European portion of the population, and the Chinese, Tamils and Malays have names for the streets very different from their Municipal titles. In the selection of names for the streets, Chinese names were very properly selected for the Chinese part of the town, and Malay names for many of the streets in Kampong Glam, and one would naturally have supposed that such names as \"Hongkong Street\" and \"Macao Street\" would have been adopted by the Chinese, and that the Malays would have had no hesitation in appropriating a name like \"Jalan Sultan.\"\n\nBut, whatever the reason may be, the fact remains that the Municipal names are ignored by the natives, with the exception of the police, who are, of course, compelled to learn them. I think, therefore, it will be of interest to give a list of some of the principal Chinese and Tamil names, as the names illustrate, to a certain extent, the characteristics of each nation. For example, what can be more characteristic of the Singapore Tamil than the names he has given to the Esplanade, to Bain Court, and to Tank Road? With regard to the Chinese names, they may, I think, be divided into three classes, i.e., purely Malay names pronounced in Chinese fashion, Malay names translated into Chinese, and lastly descriptive names.\nThe descriptive names are mostly very good, and while the appropriateness of the name for Church Street may only strike those who are acquainted with police work in Singapore, yet we can all admire the picturesque names for Thomson and Alexandra Roads. I have not attempted to include the Malay names in the list, as Malays take but little notice of streets, and, as a rule, only describe places by Kam-pongs, which are of course well known in the case of Singapore.\n\nI am indebted to my friend Mr. J. O. Anthonisz for the list of Tamil names, and I have to thank Messrs. Li A Sik and Tan Tiang Siong for preparing the list of Chinese names. The Chinese names are given in the list as pronounced by the Hokkien Chinese.\n\nH. T.

T. HAUGHTON.\nNOTES ON A TRIP TO BUKIT ETAM,\nSELANGOR.\n\nBY\n\nLIEUT. H. J. KELSALL, R. E.\n\nN the 1st of January, 1891, I started in company with Mr. Lawder, District Officer at Kajang, for a five days' trip in the jungle. Our destination was Bukit Etam, situated about 25 miles due East of Kwala Lumpur. By road the distance is about 30 miles.\n\nWe reached as far as Ulu Langat, a native village about 13 miles from Kwala Lumpur, and slept there that night in the Police Station, a room of which is set apart for the use of travellers. Here we got eight or nine coolies to carry our baggage.\n\nAt 7.20 A.M. on the 2nd, we left Ulu Langat. We rode the first 12 or 13 miles to the foot of the hill, there being a good bridle-path, which had been made by Mr. Lawder for the use of the Resident a few weeks before. Previous to this there had only been a foot-path through the jungle. The path crosses the Langat River at Ulu Langat, and then runs more or less parallel to the left bank of the river, passing for the first two miles through second growth jungle, and now and then crossing a stream by means of a rough bridge. The jungle then becomes more dense, the ordinary lowland jungle, with thick undergrowth, the most striking tree being the beautiful red and orange Ixora, the \"Jarum Jarum\" of the Malays, which here grows to a height of 25 or 30 feet. Three miles from Ulu Langat a path branches off to the hot springs of Dusun Tuah. There are five or six of these springs altogether.\nall near the river. One, I am told, actually rises in the bed of the stream. The principal stream rises out of a mass of granitic rock about 20 feet high and 30 or 40 in circumference. Sulphuretted hydrogen is given off in considerable quantities by the springs. The temperature of the water is, I believe, about 180\u00b0 Fahr., but as I had no thermometer I could not test it myself. Butterflies of several species appeared to like the hot water, for they hovered about and settled on the moist rocks and sucked up the water. Here I got three or four specimens of that prince of butterflies, the beautiful Ornithoptera Brookeana, resplendent in black and green velvet. The water of the river here is quite cold and clear like an English stream, and orchids are pretty abundant on the trees. No beasts were seen in the jungle, and only a few birds. One or two red woodpeckers, a few tailor-birds (Orthotomus ruficeps) and bulbuls, a solitary pair of crows, and now and then a wagtail were the only representatives of the feathered tribes that were seen.\n\nThe Sungei Lui, an affluent of the Sungei Langat, had to be forded three or four times in the course of our ride, but was nowhere much more than knee-deep. On the sandy banks of the river, especially at one place where there were a lot of durian skins, and at moist spots on the paths, numbers of butterflies, principally belonging to the family Pierid\u00e6, but including some Papilios and others, were seen, and every now and then one of the blues would cross the path with a flash of metallic light, or a big swallow-tail zigzag down the road, or a glorious black and gold Ornithopteron come sailing lazily out of the jungle, at one side only, to disappear a moment or two later on the other. Leeches were, as usual, plentiful in this low damp jungle. A beautiful orange-flowered globba (Globba aurantiaca) was plentiful along the sides of the path, and I found a single plant of a small-leaved begonia.\n\nAt the foot of the hill, where the path to Ginting Peris branches off, we dismounted, and sent our ponies back to Ulu Langat. After a rest of some hours, and tiffin, we started to walk the remaining four or five miles, all of which is uphill and pretty steep. After ascending a short way, a belt of\ngiant bamboos is passed through, and the character of the jungle begins to change. The undergrowth is not so dense. There is also a perceptible difference in the air\u2014there is a freshness in it that that of the low jungle does not possess. The path here zigzags a good deal, owing to the steepness of the hill. At a height of 2,000 to 2,500 feet the jungle becomes more stunted: fewer large trees are seen and magnificent tree ferns reaching a height of 20 or 30 feet are fairly common. The path follows the crest of a spur of the main ridge, till it reaches a small Sakei ladang, or clearing, where a bamboo hut had been erected for the use of the Resident when he visited the hill some weeks before. Here there were also one or two deserted Sakei huts\u2014mere attap sheds raised on poles some ten feet or so from the ground\u2014and a small plantation of sugar-cane. Here we spent the night very comfortably, although it was rather cold, and were lulled to sleep by the sweet wild music of the Sakei wind-organs. These are made of long bamboos, in each joint of which is made a small slit. They are lashed upright to the top branches of a tree, and when the wind blows act something like gigantic flutes. The sound they make is weird yet soothing.\n\nOn the morning of the 3rd January, we started at 7 A.M., and under the guidance of the only Sakei we found in the place (who informed us that he had been with Cameron, the well-known Malayan explorer) went to the top of the ridge. All the valleys below were full of white mist, which marked out the courses of the streams, but as this cleared away under the influence of the morning sun, we had a magnificent view\u2014Kuala Lumpur due West, and beyond that Klang Straits, and a little more to the northward Pulau Angsa. By climbing a tree we got a view all round, and found we were at the highest point of the ridge. The hill consists of a hog-backed ridge four or five miles long, running North and South and rising from South to North, with several spurs lying at right angles to it. The top of the ridge is only a few yards wide and the sides slope steeply down. An animal track runs along the crest, and the rocks and roots of trees between which it passes are in many places worn smooth by\nanimals brushing past. There were merely pools of rain water all along the path, and in the mud the fresh track of a rhinoceros. The jungle on and near the summit is entirely different from that lower down. The trees are stunted and gnarled, and they as well as the ground are thickly clothed with luxuriant moss nearly a foot thick and saturated with moisture. From the top of one of the trees I was able to get a view of the twin peaks of Gunong Hantu and Gunong Besar to the North-East, and setting the coolies to work we made a small clearing which enabled us to get a good view of the country in the direction of Kwala Lumpur and Klang to the West, and Ulu Selangor to the North-West, with all the intervening country. The ridge of limestone rocks near Batu stands out distinctly like a great wall or dyke running nearly East and West. While the men were at work clearing, I spent the time collecting plants. Amongst those I obtained, were a Rhododendron, a fine Medinilla with a pink flower and red undersides to the leaves, Burmanicea longifolia with beautiful pale bluish-white flowers hanging in clusters from the top of a stem a foot or eighteen inches high, the glorious Nepenthes sanguinea with pouches eight or nine inches in length, a Sotterila, and a large number of orchids\u201423 or more species, including a fine C\u00e6logyne (probably new), one or two specimens of Spathoglottis aurea, and several species of Anectochilus, one a fine red one with a broad yellow band down the centre, and a green variety of the same, another of a beautiful velvety bronze colour with crimped edges, and another of a deep red-brown with pink edges and undersides. Few birds were seen on the top of the hill. A species of thrush of a uniform dark brown colour, and a few small flower-peckers were almost the only ones. Not having a gun I could not obtain specimens. Insects were not numerous. There were some flies and bees, and I got a single specimen of Vanessa perakana and one of Atella sinha.\n\nHaving brought a good supply of kajangs, we made a smart hut about 500 feet higher up than that where we spent the first night, and about half a mile from the crest of the ridge.\nThe next morning we set the coolies to work again at the clearings on the summit, while we followed up the course of the stream which ran near our camp. The bed was full of large boulders of granite, amongst which the stream eventually disappeared about a quarter of a mile from the crest of the ridge. I got some more orchids and two species of begonia growing on the rocks in the stream. In the gully in which the stream ran grew a very large species of *Amomum*, the fronds of which were 25 or 30 feet long, but I obtained no flowers of it.\n\nBy the evening the coolies had made a sufficient clearing to enable us to get a good view of Gunong Besar and Gunong Hantu. The view from the summit was really magnificent, extending over the whole of Selangor, a great part of Jelebu, and part of Sungei Ujong. That night we slept at our new camp, and were glad of a log fire in the evening. Early the next morning we started for Kwala Lumpur, walking the first six miles, and then, meeting our ponies, riding to within nine miles of Kwala Lumpur, where a dog-cart was waiting to take us on.\n\nOn the 15th January I started for a second visit to Bukit Etam. This time with only a Chinese boy and a few coolies. I slept, as before, at Ulu Langat for the first night. Having a minimum thermometer with me I was able to take some readings. At 8 p.m. on the night of the 15th, the temperature in the verandah of the Police Station was 68\u00b0 Fahr. It had been raining all the afternoon since 4 p.m. The following morning the thermometer registered a temperature of 65\u00b0. At 7 a.m. it was 72\u00b0. This time I walked the whole way, stopping for an hour at the hot springs at Dusun Tuah, in the hopes of taking some more specimens of *Ornithoptera Brookeana*, but I only saw one, which I failed to secure.\n\nAt the bank of one of the streams I had to cross, I got a fair number of insects, including two specimens of *Clerome fannula*, several *Papilios*, and *Pierid\u00e6*.\n\nI reached the big hut at the Sakei clearings about 4 p.m.; my coolies about two hours later. They appeared not to be accustomed to hill work, and were quite done up, although\nthey had light loads. The temperature inside the hut at 8.30 p.m. was 64\u00b0 Fahr.\n\nNext morning I started at 6 a.m. and moved up to the upper camp, and started collecting plants. I got a good number, including 25 species of fir and some good orchids, amongst which were a lot of *Anectochlis* similar to those I got on the previous trip; also a good *Bulbophyllum*. I gathered a sack full of orchids for Mr. Ridley of the Botanic Gardens, Singapore.\n\nThe temperature at 6 p.m. outside the hut was 63\u00b0 Fahr. The minimum reading on the morning of the 18th was 56\u00b0, and at 11 a.m. the temperature was 64\u00b0. The thermometer was hung outside the north end of the hut, the hut being on the western slope of the hill. I collected another sack full of orchids, all from the top of the hill. I also found three specimens of a saprophyte\u2014*Thismia aseroe\u2014and one of my men brought me a small land crab of a reddish-brown colour and about half an inch across.*\n\nFinding my men had run out of rice, and having collected as much as I could carry, I decided to return to Kwala Lumpur that afternoon, and started at 2 p.m. in pouring rain, leaving my men to follow with the baggage. It rained all the way to Kwala Lumpur, which I reached at 9.45 p.m. My men came in the next afternoon.\n\n**The following Plants were collected by Lieut. Kelsall on Bukit Etam, Selangor:\u2014**\n\n*Dillenia aurea*, Sm.\n*Illicum cambodianum*, Kurz.\n*Pyrenaria Kunstleri*, King.\n*Schima Noronh\u00e6*, Var.? In fruit only.

I suppose at least that this plant, which I have also from Kwala Lumpur, is this species. It fits the description well, but I have a specimen of what appears to be D. crinitus from Bukit Timah, Singapore, where it is common, labelled \"D. platypus\" from Kew. Mr. Clarke states that the two species are very nearly allied, and as D. crinitus is rather variable in form of leaf, these two species may be the same.\n\nD. sp. nov. A most remarkable plant, which is evidently new, but the specimens were all flowerless. The leaves were crowded and resembled those of such a fern as Polypodium decorum, being most elegantly lobed and cut, and bright red. The flowers were white. It would be a charming plant for cultivation.\n\n\u00c6schynanthus speciosus, Hook. This plant was also brought by Lieut. Kelsall, having been collected by Mr. Syers in Ulu Selangor.

This curious fungus I also met with in the jungle at Pataling near Kwala Lumpur. It is known from Sikkim and Java and Sumatra.\n\nBesides these, there were a number of plants of more difficult orders, which I have not yet identified, and a large quantity of living orchids, which have not as yet shewn signs of flower, some of which will certainly prove novelties.\n\nThis list gives a fair idea of the style of the Flora of this high region. There is a large Bornean element in it, but many of the plants are common also to the Perak mountains. The Flora is evidently every rich and interesting, and the collection shows what can be done in a very short and hurried journey by any one possessed of sufficient energy to collect as he goes along.\n\nH. N. R.\nANATOMICAL NOTES ON MALAY APES.\n\nBY\n\nDr. A. Keith.\n\nI.\u2014Preliminary.\n\nIn the autumn of 1889 my thoughts were directed towards the Pathology of Fever and Ague. Some years ago, research exposed in the blood an influx of a particular micro-organism during the attack. These microbes may be the actual fever-raising virus; or they may be the producers of the fever poison; or they may only be a concomitant of that poison. Be that as it may, the next important step in the evolution of our knowledge of the disease is to determine on what particular part of the body this poison immediately acts. Symptoms, remedies and alkaloids whose specific actions are known, point to a powerful affection of the great visceral sympathetic system of nerves. This system is probably the butt of the fever poison.\n\nII.\u2014Object of Research.\n\n(a)\u2014It seemed well worth determining in a more exact manner than hitherto had been done, the anatomical relations of this nervous system, and I selected the quadrumana of this Siamese Province\u2014Bangtaphan\u2014lying at the eastern basis of the Peninsula.\n\n(b)\u2014And as about 80% of the natives, along the banks of the river of that Province, suffer to a greater or less degree from enlargement of the spleen, it was of interest to see if the quadrumana kept them company in this. But by confining my attention within so narrow limits, I should have committed great havoc among them for a small result.\n(c)\u2014So, after I had learned what might be called their normal structure, I looked for variations in their anatomy, and these variations\u2014their amount and kind\u2014signify a great deal.\n\n(d)\u2014In the young and almost adult members I observed the later acquired stages of development, to which Darwin's Law of Heredity can be applied.\n\n(e)\u2014And again, between the species of the same genus there are differences\u2014the result of physiological processes. These are of great interest.\n\nIII.\u2014The Quadrumania of Bangtaphan.\n\nA.\u2014Hylobates lar (gibbon). (Wa-Wa).\nDissected 2 Adult Females.\n1 Adult Male.\n1 F\u0153tus.\n\nI take the white circumfacial ring with the white dorsal aspects of the hands and feet as the distinctive mark of the species. In the three specimens the amount and distribution of the interdigital web varied; so it does in all the species of monkeys I have examined; the colour of hair is of little value, it varies with the sex, it varies with the year, and it varies with the animal's age.\n\nB.\u2014Papio nemestrinus (pig-tailed baboon).\nDissected 3 Adult Males.\n3 Adult Females.\n3 Juveniles.\n1 F\u0153tus.\n\nA stedfast species. It does not answer exactly to the description in Mason's \"Burmah,\" having the ringed hair, and also a remarkable leonine appearance\u2014in the male only. The baby is of a greyish yellow colour with dark brown hairs along the spine. There is a remarkable resemblance to the young of the stumpy-tailed monkey.\n\nC.\u2014Papio arctoides (the stumpy-tailed baboon).\n\nNot nearly so abundant as the last species. Of these, as yet I have made no dissections, but at present I have a couple of tame ones. One is quite a baby with a white face, hair of\na dirty yellow hue, and a black stripe down its back, which is spreading laterally.\n\nD.\u2014*Papio cynomolgus* (crab-eating baboon).\n\nAbundant near the sea side. No dissections.\n\nI have had tame specimens of all three species. Mentally they differ immensely. A young female *P. cynomolgus* was full of mischief, fun and fight. *P. nemestrinus* was quiet and retiring, but given to lasting fits of anger; while *P. arctoides* was a most staid individual with a far-away gaze and his whole mind seemed steadily occupied sexually.\n\nE.\u2014*Semnopithecus albocinereus* (Schinz), (steel-grey monkey).\n\nDissected 13 Adults.\n\n2 F\u0153tuses.\n\nF.\u2014*Semnopithecus femoralis* (Horsfield), (black monkey).\n\nDissected 1 Adult.\n\n1 F\u0153tus.\n\nThe f\u0153tus and babies of both are of a dull buff yellow. *S. albocinereus* is anatomically very variable, as one would expect from the immense number of nearly allied species. In Bangtaphan both of these species are very abundant. They have very distinctive cries; that of *S. albocinereus* is a deep guttural ejaculation, while that of *S. femoralis*, though evidently produced in a similar manner, has a distinctive metallic timbre, which medical men would describe as a \"cracked pot\" sound.\n\nG.\u2014*Nycticebus tardigradus*. (Slow loris).\n\nRare. No dissections.\n\nElucidation of some of the details has required dissections of other animals, amongst these:\n\n1. A young Bornean mias (orang-utan).\n2. *Galeopithecus volans* (2 specimens) (flying lemur).\n3. *Pteropus marginatus* (2 specimens) (bat).\n\nIV.\u2014VARIATION OF THE SPLEEN.\n\nWithin the bounds of health, the spleen varies in weight with the phase of digestion and period of the day. But I take it, that an increase of one-third in weight, beyond the average\nrelative weight of an organ, constitutes an abnormal condition of that organ. The accompanying table gives the actual and relative weight in most of the specimens I have examined, and chart I is a more lucid representation of the same. The spleen appears to be comparatively large in the mature foetus, and enlargements are more common in adult females than adult males. In Papio and Hylobates the spleen seems to be wonderfully stedfast, while in the genus Semnopithecus the variability is great\u2014from .0010 to .0055. But in none could I say there was a resemblance to the human ague spleen. The nearest approach to this condition I have yet come across was the spleen of a young female orang-utan. I have a young stumpy-tailed baboon who suffered at one time greatly from anaemia, his ears and face having the almost characteristic hue of malarious cachexia, but the fluctuations in his temperature were slight\u2014102\u00b0 to 102.75\u00b0 F. Another very young stumpy-tailed monkey\u2019s temperature is 101.2\u00b0 F., while the crab-eating monkey has a temperature of 101\u00b0 F. Thus the results of the enlargement of the spleen, as an indication of fever in the monkeys, are negative.\n\nV.\u2014Some of the Variations in Structure.\n\nIn the jungle, remote from reference, it is impossible to give an adequate account of these. I will broadly note the chief ones.\n\nOf the three species I have examined, Semnopithecus albocinereus is the most variable; next Hylobates lar; while has Papio nemestrinus has a wonderfully stedfast structure. One would expect to find variation in those parts or organs:\n\n1st, which differ in nearly allied species and genera; or\n\n2nd, which have undergone an increase or change of function.\n\nThe assumption of the semi-upright position by the lower quadrupeds, and the downright position (using downright in distinction to upright as applied to man) by the higher quadrupeds (Hylobates and Simia), has led to a change of function, in degree and kind, of many of the organs of the body. The rough diagrams a, b, c and d show partly what I mean. From these it can be seen that the line of support is continually changing. Thus the spinal column, especially about\nthe lumbar region, ought to show variations. This position further leads to a change in the mode of respiration, and we ought again to find variations in the bony structure of the chest, as in the sternum cartilages and ribs. And those parts are the most variable in the monkey organism.\n\n(a)\u2014Variations of the Sternum. (Breast-bone).\n\nIn the cartilaginous foetal sternum, centres of ossification appear, and it is the almost universal condition in the mammalian kingdom, for the first centre to spread and form the first piece or manubrium, while the second, third, fourth and fifth may or may not unite to form the sternum. But in the genus *Hylobates* (gibbons) the rule seems to be for the first and second pieces to unite and form the manubrium. Of the four specimens I dissected, two united in this manner (diag. IV), and two did not (diag. III). Professor Dwight called attention to this point (Journal of Anatomy, 1890) and gave the following cases, which I tabulate:\n\n| Specimens in which the 1st and 2nd pieces united to form manubrium. | Specimens in which the 1st and 2nd pieces did not unite. |\n|---|---|\n| Hylobates leuciscus, 2 specimens, (Dwight). | Hylobates lar, 1 specimen, (Dwight). |\n| Hylobates vari\u00e9, 2 Specimens, (Knox). | Hylobates lar, 2 specimens. |\n| Hylobates syndactylus, 1 Specimen. | |\n| Hylobates lar, 2 specimens. | |\n\nTotal, 7 specimens. Total, 3 specimens.\n\nProfessor Dwight gives diag. I shewing the same condition in man, and diag. II shows it in *Hylobates leuciscus*. I found a very close approximation to the same form in a specimen of *Semnopithecus alboceinereus* (see diag. VI). Professor Dwight is of the opinion that it means nothing more than that nature is on one of her accidental excursions, but the condition seems rather too wide spread for that. The sternum in the quadru-\nmana is in a plastic condition, and the great development of the pectoral muscles\u2014especially the manubrial portion of them\u2014may determine the union of the first and second parts.\n\nThe sixth centre of sternal ossification appears late in juvenile life in the Semnopithecii, and in one adult it had failed to put in an appearance (see diag. VIII).\n\n(b)\u2014Variations in Ribs and Chest Walls.\n\nIn the same genus the eighth pair of ribs seem undecided whether they should terminate in the fibro-cartilage in front of the xiphoid or not come within an inch of it (see diags. VI, VII, VIII, IX, X). In Papio nemestrinus the eighth pair of ribs always reach the sternum (see diag. VIII). In a specimen of Semnopithecus the fifth rib terminated in a piece of cartilage to which some fibres of the diaphragm were attached (see diag. VI). In three specimens of the same genus, I came across rib-like developments in the fifth, sixth and seventh costal cartilages (see diag. VIII), and in all the adults, these cartilages were more or less ossified.\n\nThere are three floating ribs as a rule in Semnopithecus, but in two specimens the tenth rib had joined those above and become a false rib.\n\n(c)\u2014Variations in the Lumbar Region.\n\nIn a foetus of Papio nemestrinus, I found the transverse process of the first lumbar vertebra enlarged and representing a thirteenth rib. It was costal in dimensions and appearance (see diag. XI). There was a similar condition in the second lumbar vertebra of Hylobates lar, representing a fourteenth rib (see diag. XII).\n\nIn the gibbon the twenty-sixth vertebra affects the chief support of the pelvic bones, while in the monkeys and baboons it is the twenty-seventh. Diag. XV shows the peculiar condition found in one of the Semnopithecii, on one side the twenty-seventh as usual is supported by the pelvic bones, but on the other side it is the twenty-eighth, the twenty-seventh on that side having a plain transverse process. Professor G. B. Howes (Journal of Anatomy, July, 1890) shows a similar condition in a frog (diag. XIV). The above-mentioned specimen shows considerable aggregations of cartilage on its twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth transverse process as if at one time they had\nhad intentions of having connection with the pelvic bones. Such growth of cartilage on the tips of transverse processes is not of uncommon occurrence (diag. XVI). In a foetus of *Hylobates lar* the transverse process of the twenty-seventh vertebra was in a much further state of development than the twenty-sixth (diags. XVIII and XVII).\n\nIn one specimen of *Semnopithecus* the abdominal aorta divided on the twenty-fourth vertebra instead of the twenty-sixth, and smaller degrees of variation are common.\n\nThe arrangement of blood vessels in the pelvis is very variable. The insertion of the diaphragm may shift down a vertebra and the muscles arising from the anterior aspect of the lumbar region are also liable to variation.\n\n(d)\u2014Variations in Muscles of the Limbs.\n\nWith the great increase and change of functions in the arms of the *Hylobates*, one would not be surprised to come across variations in the muscles of these limbs. The biceps becomes the great muscle of locomotion, and in diag. XIX we have what might be called the normal condition\u2014one head coming from the coracoid process, the other coming from the top of the glenoid cavity; while in diag. XX we have the glenoid head coming as usual, while the coracoid comes from the edge of the biceps groove. A curious thing, in connection with this, is the transference of the triceps head of the latissimus dorsi to the biceps, thus from an extensor in the monkeys and baboons, it becomes a flexor in the gibbons (see diag. XX).\n\nThere are also numerous variations amongst the extensor muscles of the forearm and leg, while there are numerous forms of arrangement in the arteries and veins of the lower limbs.\n\n(e)\u2014Variations in the Viscera.\n\nDiag. XXI shows the appendix vermiformis of the gibbons\u2014long, narrow and worm-like; that of the orang is almost similar; diag. XXII shows that of the pig-tailed baboon, only a contraction of the c\u00e6cum: diag. XXV gives the usual form of the c\u00e6cum of the *S. albocinereus*, with hardly an appendix at all, but sometimes it resembles that of the pig-tailed baboon as in diag. XXIV.\nSometimes in dissections of the human body we find the kidneys united by an isthmus of renal matter, such an arrangement being called the horse-shoe kidney. Diag. XXVI shows such a variation in *Semnopithecus*. In *Hylobates* (see diag. XXXVII) the thyroid gland has a large isthmus lying in front of the trachea; in *Papio* this isthmus is very attenuated; in *Semnopithecus* it is non-existent, although sometimes a rudimentary one may be met with. The thymus gland sometimes exists in adults, and sometimes is absent in infants.\n\nThis is but an introduction to the more superficial variations in the quadrumania. We can never know their correct systematic position, nor the direction of their evolutionary tendency, nor their relations to man and to their brother quadrumania, until these be known. And as the all-pervading tropical jungle is gradually being replaced by a vegetation necessary for the sustenance of increasing humanity, the quadrumania will be replaced by man. The century that will hold the apes in its conservatories of rarities, is not far distant, if coming centuries are at all like the great nineteenth.\n\nVI.\u2014A FEW POINTS IN DEVELOPMENT.\n\n(a)\u2014Ear.\n\nIn each species of quadrumania the ear steadily maintains its characteristics. It attains its full growth long before maturity is reached, and still some of its transformations take place late in adult life. Diags. XXVIII and XXIX are from Darwin's well-known illustrations showing the occurrence in the human helix of a slight protuberance probably likely representing the aural tip of the lower animals. In *Papio cynomolgus* this tip is large and remains unfolded (diag. XXX). In *Papio nemestrinus* and *Semnopithecus albocinereus* one can see this tip folding in late in foetal life (diags. XXI and XXXII). In a specimen of *Hylobates lar* this tip was unfolded (diag. XXXII). The aural edge of the orang is folded to a greater extent than that of man and has no lobe, but on the other hand that of the *Semnopithecus* has the lobe and resembles closely the human ear. Man seems to have picked many of his parts in common with several of the quadrumania. The teeth of the *Semnopitheci* are more human than those of the orang.\n(b)\u2014The Intertemporal Space and the Temporal Ridges.\n\n(See diags. XXXVI, XXXVII, XXXVIII, XXXIX).\n\nThe intertemporal space is bounded laterally by the temporal ridges from which rise the temporal muscles; in front by the frontal ridges, behind by the occipital ridges, from which rise the occipital muscles. In foetal life and youth this space covers nearly the whole skull, but as the animal grows older the temporal muscles climb up the sides of the skull, while the occipital scramble up behind and the intertemporal space melts away before them. Thus the temporal ridges may crush it out and meet, as in the adult orang, and form a ridge. As a general rule, it may be taken that the larger this space the greater the relative size of the brain to the body. A small intertemporal space means large temporal and occipital muscles; large temporal muscles mean large canine teeth (fighting teeth) or coarse food; coarse food means a big stomach, and a big stomach, as I shall presently show, means a small brain. Keep away the effect of the big canine teeth and this intertemporal space can be formulated so as to give a wonderfully exact indication of the relative amount of brain matter.\n\nBut the proper signification of these temporal ridges has an important value in classification. They certainly cannot have any generic value, and little stress can be laid on them as specific distinctions, seeing the ease with which they could be varied and the degree in which they do vary with age and sex. They do not reach their final position until well into adult life.\n\n(c)\u2014Epiphysis of the Bones.\n\nTake the scapula (shoulder blade) of the young monkeys for instance. Along the base we find a border of cartilage. This border foreshadows the further development the bone is to undergo (diags. XL, XLI, XLII.) According to Darwin's Law of Heredity, these borders represent the latest evolutionary acquisitions of the scapula. Thus XL, XLI, XLII represent the latest scapular additions made to Semnopithecus, Papio, and Hylobates. Semnopithecus and Hylobates have had their infra-spinatus space augmented, giving them increased arm\nclimbing power, while *Papio* has had both supra and infra-spinatus enlarged equally, which is probably connected with their all-fours locomotion on the ground.\n\nThe lateral extension of the sternum seems to have a similar meaning. Indeed from the epiphysis we can read the late history of the animal.\n\nMany of the tendinous insertions of muscles in adult life get assimilated with the periosteum of the underlying bones and thus there appears a difference in the adult and foetal insertion of a muscle. (See diags. XLIII and XLIV).\n\nVII.\u2014A FEW PHYSIOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS.\n\nThese problems are of even more interest than those of variation and development already given. But to understand their real meaning one must break through the conventional idea of human time. While the clock that marks the progress of things human has moved a century, the pendulum that registers the progress of the things of evolution has but swung a second. The failure to grasp a wider than vulgar view of time has kept many of the conservative naturalists from appreciating the final problems of evolution.\n\n*How the Stomach, Brain and Muscles are correlated.*\n\nThe stomach of the three gibbons weighed, on an average, 903 grains, while on an average their contents (mostly green acid figs) weighed 4,100 grains. Their proportion to the weight of the body was respectively .0110 and .0462. Taking half-a-dozen of the *Semnopithecus*, their stomachs weigh 3,216 grains (relative weight=.0400) and contents 25,000 grains (.3200 of body weight). The table shows this more clearly.\n\n| Body Weight | Stomach Weight | Contents Weight | Relative Weight, Stomach | Relative Weight, Contents |\n|-------------|----------------|-----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Hylobates lar, 3 Specimens, ... | 12.5 lbs. | 903 grs. | 4,100 grs. | .0110 | .0462 |\n| Semno. albocinereus, 6 Specimens, | 15.4 lbs. | 3,216 grs. | 25,000 grs. | .0400 | .3200 |\nThat is, the gibbon carries a diet about one-twenty-fifth part of his weight and spends one-hundredth of his internal economy in carrying it and doing the first part of his digestion. On the other hand, this white-eyed, steel-grey monkey has to perform his locomotion with a diet load nearly one-third of his weight and expends as much as one-twenty-fifth part of his bodily substance on his stomach, as much as he does on his liver.\n\nAnd it is from the stomach that the brain receives its impulse for work. And the progress is from a plentiful food supply that is difficult of digestion, such as the steel-grey monkey's staple and abundant diet amongst the bamboo leaves, to a scarcer and more inaccessible but more easily digestible food, as the green acid figs, and other fruit foods of the gibbon. On the one hand an intricate, large and expensive apparatus is used; on the other a simpler and smaller organ does the work. The extensive foraging excursions of the gibbon entail much more brain labour than the 'barn-door' feeding of the grey monkeys. The gibbon has added to his brain and subtracted from his stomach. And it was this simple mathematical calculation that brought us to where we are.\n\nSuch a statement the facts of the case bear out. We tabulate the brain statistics of the above group of monkeys, and this is how the matter stands:\n\n| Average Bodily Weight | Actual Brain Weight | Relative Brain Weight |\n|-----------------------|--------------------|----------------------|\n| Hylobates lar,        | 12.5 lbs.          | 1,607 grs.           | .0187               |\n| S. albocinereus,      | 15.5 lbs.          | 1,113 grs.           | .0120               |\n\nThe relative weight of the brain is in inverse ratio to that of the stomach, the gibbons spending $\\frac{1}{50}$ of their tissue on brain $+ \\frac{1}{100}$ on stomach, while the grey monkey spends about $\\frac{1}{90}$ on his brain $+ \\frac{1}{25}$ on his stomach. Man has reached the furthest point in this direction; he spends about $\\frac{1}{50}$ of his economy upon a stomach, he gives about $\\frac{1}{50}$ to his brain. In a young rang-utan (7 months), I found the brain weighing one-four-\nteenth of its bodily weight, while its stomach weighed a little over one-hundredth.\n\nChart II looks as if it did not bear out the statement that increase of brain means decrease of stomach. The orang is quite out of line, and in connection with this I would point out that the development of the brain seems not to be governed by the law that regulates the growth of other organs. The relative amount of brain matter is greatest in foetal life; from that point onwards to full growth it diminishes. I tabulate the statistics derived from mother and child in the following species:\n\n| Species                  | Weight of Adult Brain | Juvenile or Foetal Brain |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|\n|                          | Actual.   | Relative. | Actual.   | Relative. |\n| Female Hylobates lar,    | 1,620 grs. | .017      | 85 grs.   | .12       |\n| Semno. albocinereus,     | 1,160 ,,    | .016      | 460 ,,    | .060      |\n| Papio nemestrinus,       | 1,340 ,,    | .019      | 1,300 ,,  | .216      |\n| Bitch and Pup,           | 1,180 ,,    | .0056     | 595 ,,    | .0218     |\n\nContrast this with the spinal cord development:\n\n| Species                  | Weight of Spinal Cord in Adult. | Weight of Spinal Cord in Baby and Pup. |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n|                          | Actual. | Relative. | Actual. | Relative. |\n| Papio nemestrinus,       | 175 grs. | .0025     | 26 grs. | .0040     |\n| Bitch and Pup,           | 290 grs. | .0014     | 38 grs. | .00138    |\n\nThe other organs of the body increase much in ratio with the rest; it is so with the spinal cord, but the brain grows with no relation to the state of the other organs, save the stomach.\nAnd the greater the cerebral development the greater is its disproportion to the other organs in foetal life.\n\nI should have liked to give some statements as to the correlation of brain and stomach, or what is the same thing, internal economy with external surroundings, by means of the muscular system, but as my paper has crept to considerable length, I will defer these and some other curious details which I have observed in the quadrumania of this region.\nII.\u2014Chart showing Correlation of Stomach and Brain.\n\n* Relative Weight of the Brain to Weight of the Body.\n\nSemnopithecus.

DEW,\n\nCollector and Magistrate and Harbour Master,\nMatang and Port Weld, Perak.\n\nHE Chinese fishing village situated on the South bank of the entrance to the Kurau River is said to have been in existence for more than thirty years. ONG GAN, one of the oldest inhabitants, has lived here for twenty-six years, and there were a good many fishermen then\u2014about 15 houses\u2014and the village has gradually grown to its present size. It now consists of from 70 to 80 houses, with between 450 and 500 Hokkien Chinese, all fishermen, working about 75 nets (pukat) and about 140 boats. Besides nets, they at present work fishing stakes (blat) as under:\n\n1 Blat Jerumal,\n1 Blat Telok,\n4 Blat Kedah; and about\n30 Blat Langei.\n\nLarge fishing stakes will not stand here, as the mud is too soft; they require firmer ground.\n\nThe nets used are of two kinds\u2014pukat hanyut (drifting net) and pukat lengkong (seine net). Besides these there are the hand nets used by prawn-catchers (siring udang and sungkar udang). A brief description of these stakes and nets may perhaps be of interest.\nBlat Jerumal (an out-shore blat).\n\nThis is made facing the ebb tide. \\( A B C D \\), enclosure of stakes, with a net-work of bamboo or rattan sega round it. \\( C F, D E \\), fences of ditto guiding in the fish. \\( C D \\) are high nibong posts with pulleys on top. At the bottom of the enclosure is a rattan net called the \"daun\" (leaf); ropes pass through the pulleys on \\( C \\) and \\( D \\) and make fast to the outside corners of the \"daun.\" Men watch in the hut at ebb tide, and, when they see enough fish are in, haul up the outer edge of the \"daun\" first, and the fish are caught. The inside end is then raised, and the fish thrown out into the boat, and the \"daun\" again set. This trap is fixed in about \\( 3\\frac{1}{2} \\) fathoms of water, low spring tides.\nBlat Telok (an in-shore blat).\n\nSet facing and close to the shore. The water runs out at ebb tide, and the fish all run into the trap. In this trap are caught *Ikan Sembilan*, *Ketrak*, *Sablah*, and sometimes prawns. The construction is similar to the *Jerumal*, but the mesh of the net-work is much smaller, and the whole thing is made of much lighter material.\nBlat Kedah (an in-shore blat). This is a smaller edition of the Blat Kombang, and is an in-shore fishing stake.\n\nMade of bakau-wood stakes, the net-work of bamboo or rattan sega. Fish enter with the ebb tide, and are then hustled from the first and second kurongs into the third with a rattan arrangement called a sisir.\n\nIt is worked by two or three men.\nBlat Langei (an in-shore blat).\n\nMade of bakau (mangrove) wood stakes. The trap is a string net in the shape of a bag. There are six rattan rings on it, and the net travels up and down on stakes passed through the rings.\n\nA man watches in a boat outside the net, and pulls it up to empty out the fish, and re-sets it; the operation is repeated as long as the ebb tide lasts.\nPukat Hanyut (drift net).\n\nThis net is from 80 to 100 fathoms long and 6 fathoms deep, of a mesh (mata serat) of about $1\\frac{1}{2}$ inches square.\n\nAt one end it is made fast to a large float $F$ (polompong) about $1\\frac{1}{2}$ feet in diameter. The other end is made fast to the boat. The net is kept up by floats along the top. It has no weights at the bottom. It drifts along dragging the boat after it, and can be worked in both tides. Only one or two men are required to work it, and large fish are caught in it. The fish strike against it and get entangled.\nPukat Lengkong (seine net).\n\nThis net is from 80 to 100 fathoms long and 2 fathoms deep; it has floats along the top, and one large one attached to the centre of the top edge $F$ by a two-fathom line; the bottom is weighted with tin. The big float (polompong) is first thrown overboard. The net is put out at ebb tide; one end is held by a large boat, and a small boat takes the other end round to the big boat, encircling the fish. The leads must be on the ground, or the fish escape underneath. When hauling the net into the boat, a man goes overboard and gets inside the net to tend the leads, see they do not get foul of sticks, &c., and let the fish out. The mesh is about $\\frac{1}{2}$ inch, and all kinds of fish and prawns are caught, though the large kinds are thus caught but seldom, as they frequent the deeper waters. Five men are required to work it.\nSiring Udang (hand prawn net).\n\nThis is made of coarse cloth (siring), has a shallow mouth and a deep bag at the end. It is attached to two sticks crossed as above, and the man, going into the water, places the fork S against his shoulder, and pushes it along in front of him on the ground, and the prawns are shovelled into the bag.\nThe Sungkar Udang is similar but made of string.\n\nThese are all the methods, at present in vogue, of taking fish at Kwala Kurau.\n\nI am, however, acquainted with some other methods of taking fish followed in this country, and, as they may be any day adopted here, it may be as well to enumerate them.\n\nThe Blat Kombang is made on the same principle as the Blat Kedah, but is longer, and is an out-shore fishing stake, and will take up to eight men to work it, according to its size. The Blat Batawie (out-shore blat) is the same as the Blat Kombang, only the rattan netting is of a larger, coarser mesh, and is for catching large fish. It is set in channels in about 2 fathoms of water, low spring tides. The Blat Lengkong (in-shore blat) is the same as the latter, only the netting round it is much finer and closer, being made of bertam. With it is caught the Ikan bunga ayer, about 1 to 2 inches long, which is very good eating, and fetches, when salted, about 5 cents per catty.\n\nThe Rawei.\nA B is a long rope, running up to 200 fathoms in length. At intervals of about $1\\frac{1}{2}$ fathoms are placed bamboos to act as floats, C D E F G H I J K L M. From the rope A B are suspended, at the end of lines about 1 fathom long, hooks of iron, of a fairly large size; about 10 hang from between each float.\n\nThe hooks are unbaited, and the contrivance is either allowed to float about or is anchored at one end. Any scaleless fish of a moderate size trying to pass get hooked about the body. Fish with scales, such as the Selangin, Sinahong, &c., are protected by their scales and do not get hooked. It is set at ebb tide and taken up at flood; two or three men work it in a boat, generally Chinese. With it are caught Ikan Yu (shark), Pari (skate, three kinds, the black with white spots is the best), Yu parang (sword fish), Duri, Goh, Bargu, Seludu, Pelotan, &c. The last five are all of one family, and are much relished by the Malays. No Raweis are used at Kurau, but it is said that at Sungei Magat Aris there are one or two, and I am told they are used in the neighbourhood of Pasir Itam, Larut.\n\nPompong.\nA B C D are two pieces of bamboo fixed to one another at right angles. Hanging from them is a net-work C K D, the Penaju, guiding the fish, entering by the mouth C D into the net trap F G H I. It is anchored to the ground, and set at ebb tide. It is an in-shore fish trap.\n\nWith the out-shore blats are caught Ikan Selangin, Sinahong, Barwei (three kinds, viz., Barwei chermin, Barwei tambar and Barwei kedaywas), Duri, Pupus, Pelatar, Chincharu, Kurau, Temeras, Siakup, Pitcha priok, &c. With the in-shore blats are caught Ikan Glammar, Selargin, Chinkarong, Pupus, Selangat, Membeli, Udang kertas, Kiki, Yu, Pari, crabs, &c.\n\nThe large blats, i.e., Blat Jerumal, Blat Kombang, and Blat Batawie, are owned by and worked by Malays; as is also the Blat Kedah. They make them themselves, and sell the fish to the Chinamen at the fishing village. Sometimes they get an advance from one of these Chinamen to assist them in putting up the blat, they agreeing in return to sell their fish to or through the Chinaman, the latter taking 10 per cent. of the value as interest, the Malay repaying the original debt out of the price fetched by the fish. The smaller blats, i.e., Blat Telok, Blat Langei, &c., are owned by and worked by the Chinese generally, and they make them themselves. The services of a Malay Pawang (sorcerer) are not called into requisition in choosing the sites for these blats, but in the case of Blat Jerumal, Blat Kombang, Blat Batawei and Blat Kedah, no one would think of commencing one until the spot had been fixed on by the driving of the first stake by a Pawang Laut (sea sorcerer) accompanied by the usual ceremonies (Jamu). The first is called \"Bacha doa,\" in which, after the first stake has been fixed in by the Pawang, certain prayers are read from a book by the Pawang, the Pawang looking towards the prepared yellow rice (nasi kunyit) brought for the occasion, the others taking part in the ceremony holding their hands up in praying attitude, and casting their eyes to heaven.\n\nThe second is the \"Ratap,\" or prayer, or lament, given in chorus, which every one knows by heart.\nThe third is more \"Bacha doa.\"\nThe fourth is \"Minta jauh bala, akan datang datang rahamat yang kabejikan\" (asking that bad luck may be far from them and that good luck may befall them).\n\nThe Pawang then scatters some of the yellow rice on the waters, and the participants in the ceremony then eat the remainder of the rice, and the fowls, which have generally been killed and cooked on shore beforehand.\n\nONG GAN states that he has never, since he has been here, known the fish to get so scarce at Kuala Kurau as during the last two or three years. AH LIEW and TAN SIANG, also very old inhabitants (the former, the farm agent, has been here twenty-eight years, and is the oldest inhabitant), all tell the same story. They cannot account in any way for the fish getting short, but think perhaps it is because there are too many people fishing. Four years ago the place increased very much in fishermen, but during the last two years some have gone away. None of them seem to have any idea when or where the fish breed, or whence or whither they come and go, and when I suggested that if we could find out we should, perhaps, order a close time to give the fish a chance of breeding, they said that would be very hard on them, as what were they to do if not allowed to fish? In fact they want to eat their cake and have it as well. I told them it was done in Europe with good results. ONG GAN says he has only known the fishing get bad like this once before, about twenty years ago. I do not believe this, however, as at Telok Rubiah, about 6 miles further off, I was told it had happened often before, the fish coming and going. I then enquired into the worldly position of the fishermen. They are all Hokkiens, and mostly related to one another. They pay their own passages over from China to join their friends, and then go into partnership with some others in the ownership of a net (Pukat Lengkong). Each net is divided into $7\\frac{1}{2}$ shares, and there are six men to a net. The owner has $1\\frac{1}{2}$ share extra for owning the net, and he works with the other five, and they all, including the owner, get one share each. Thus the owner has altogether $2\\frac{1}{2}$ shares. One\nof the six men stops in the house and salts and dries the fish, cooks the food, &c. The cost of the house, net and boats amounts to about $350, and the owner mentioned above owns the whole concern, including all furniture, tubs, &c.\n\nIn good seasons one net (Pukat Lengkong) can get fifty or sixty pikuls of salt fish in a month, but in bad seasons as little as eight or ten pikuls.\n\nThe fish is classed for export in three classes:\u2014\n\nNo. 1.\u2014Dried prawns, which fetch from $7.50 to $10.00 per pkl.\n\n,, 2.\u2014Large dried salt fish fetch from $3.00 to $ 7.00\n\n,, 3.\u2014Small dried salt fish (for manure) $0.85 to $ 1.30\n\nBlachan, $1.50 to $ 2.50\n\nPrawn shell manure. about 50 cents per pikul.\n\nThe fish manure is sold to sugar planters for manuring the sugar-cane, and the prawn shell manure is chiefly used for manuring nutmeg trees, &c.\n\nThe men are nearly all opium-smokers, but are extremely healthy and of fine physique, as men employed on the sea generally are; and there is a total absence of those nasty sores and ulcers on the legs, &c., so common among the agricultural and mining coolies.\n\nThe fishing is at its best during the 10th, 11th and 12th and 1st Chinese moons, roughly, from November 3rd to March 12th, i.e., during the North-East Monsoon, when it is fine, dry weather with but little wind or storms and waves to interrupt operations. The fishing is at its worst during the 5th, 6th and 7th moons, roughly, from June 9th to September 5th, i.e., during the South-West Monsoon, when it is very wet and windy. Every month no fishing with pukat lengkongs can be carried on between the 13th and 21st of the Chinese moon, and between the 28th and 5th, i.e., during the high spring tides; but between the 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th and 16th plenty of fish are to be got in the jerumals and blats, but not in the pukats (both kinds). There is thus a period varying from sixteen to eighteen days every month during which these nets cannot be used.\n\nGenerally speaking, the higher the tides get the less fish are to be found. During these periods of enforced idleness the\nmen make and mend their nets, cut their supply of firewood, &c.\n\nThey say that the *Ikan kurau* and *Ikan tambrai* have got scarce. It is a big fish, which, salted, fetches eight cents per catty, and in the wet season 12 cents. *Ikan selangin* and *Ikan sinahong* are also getting scarce. I suggested that perhaps the cause of this was that they caught all the young ones, but was told that this was not the case. The parent fish are only, as a rule, caught in deep waters in the out-shore *blats* and *jerumals*. They do not come into the shallow waters, where *pukat lengkong*, &c. are worked, and the young which accompany the big fish can go in and out of these *blats* without being caught.\n\nThe people complain of the heavy taxes imposed on their industry. They state that in the old days, under the Sultan of Perak, the first tax imposed was one of $12 per annum on each *pukat lengkong*, paid to the farmer. After two or three years this was found to be too heavy and was reduced to $8. The *jerumals*, *blats*, *pukat hanyuts* and other contrivances for taking fish were all free. No other payments whatever were imposed. The Opium Farmer at Kuala Kurau paid about $100 per annum to the Sultan, and imported and sold as much opium as he liked. He cooked his own opium. There were, however, but few fishermen there then. They now complain that they have to pay one-tenth of the value of their fish to the farmer, pay $10 per annum for every fishing stake, whether large or small, out-shore or in-shore, and that each person using any other means of catching fish must pay for a personal license of $1.20 per annum. Thus the six men manning a *pukat lengkong* each pay $1.20 per annum, total $7.20 per annum, and the two men working a *pukat hanyut* pay $2.40 between them. The *jerumal* and *blat* men, besides having to pay $10 per annum for their *blat* licenses, also pay $1.20 per annum each for a personal license. A *blat* or *jerumal*, requiring, say, six men, will thus cost $7.20 per annum extra. This was levied by mistake by the clerk misunderstanding the rule, and will be refunded to them. Besides this they have to pay 25 cents\nfor a port clearance, whenever their tongkangs, laden with fish for export, leave the port, and they have to pay annually for the numbering of each large pukat boat 80 cents, for a small ditto 45 cents, and the large and small sampan kotas are charged the same. For the numbering of tongkangs $1.30 is charged. They also have to pay $1 for the cost of numbering of each blat or jerumai. They are also charged 10 cents per foot frontage (Land Revenue) for their houses. I should think this, on an average, would come to about $2 per annum per house. This was imposed from January 1st, 1886, and they think it very hard that they should be charged town allotment fees for occupying a part of the useless mud bank of the river.\n\nAs regards the payment of one-tenth of the value of the fish to the farmer, they state that they have come to an arrangement with the farmer, by which they pay him $1.40 per month for each pukat lengkong instead. If the farmer did this from pure philanthropy it was very good of him; perhaps he came to the conclusion that, if he claimed his full pound of flesh, he would kill the goose that was laying the golden eggs.\n\nIt appears that, previous to December, 1885, no licenses were imposed on nets and fishing stakes in the district, though in Larut fishing-stake licenses seem to have been imposed since 1880, but no fishing-net licenses until last year. In that month, however, the Assistant Resident (Mr. Creagh) issued the order, which I have marked A, annexed, and which was issued as a notice by the Magistrate and Collector, Dr. Leech. The fishermen of this district (and I believe of other districts as well) petitioned against it, with the result that the order was suspended for further consideration, and, after much deliberation, extending over nearly a year, during which period no payments for licenses at all were imposed, the Assistant Resident issued the new order dated 1st October, 1887, which I have marked B.\n\nThe following table will show the difference between the old and new rules:\u2014\n| Description                  | Old Rule dated December, 1885 | New Rule dated October, 1887 |\n|------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Large fishing stakes per annum, ... | $10.00                       | $10.00                      |\n| Small fishing stakes per annum, ... | $8.00                        | $10.00                      |\n| Large Pukat (Lengkong), ...     | $10.00                       | Say, six men @ $1.20, ...   |\n| Small Pukat (Hanyut), ...       | $8.00                        | two men @ $1.20, ...        |\n| Prawn (Siring or Sungkar Udang), ... | $4.80                      | one man @ $1.20, ...        |\n| Total, ...                     | $40.80                       | Total, ...$30.80             |\n\nBy the new rules the fees are payable half-yearly.\n\nIt will be seen from the above table that the new rule makes a total reduction of 25 per cent. on the old rule.\n\nAs regards the statement that the fish has got scarce during the last two or three years, the following totals of exports from Kwala Kurau and Telok Rubiah, taken from the Customs Clerk's book at Kwala Kurau, will show:\n\n| Description                  | 1885 | 1886 | 1887 |\n|------------------------------|------|------|------|\n|                              | Weight | Value | Weight | Value | Weight | Value |\n|                              | Pikuls | Catties | Pikuls | Catties | Pikuls | Catties |\n| Dried prawns, ...            | 2,771.00 | 32,116.50 | 4,414.00 | 37,993.60 | 971.00 | 10,362.00 |\n| Salt fish, ...               | 8,865.00 | 20,555.30 | 3,214.00 | 8,573.40 | 8,997.75 | 22,151.40 |\n| Blachan, ...                 | 2,383.00 | 5,527.20 | 354.50 | 689.00 | 455.00 | 1,242.00 |\n| Fish and prawn shell manure, | 17,640.00 | 15,740.10 | 1,530.00 | 2,172.00 | 9,317.00 | 9,995.00 |\n| Totals, ...                  | 31,659.00 | 73,939.10 | 9,512.50 | 49,428.00 | 19,740.75 | 43,750.40 |\nFrom this it will be seen that the export of salt fish was less than half in 1886 of what it was in 1885, but in 1887 it had risen again to more than it was in 1885.\n\nDried prawns were nearly double in quantity in 1886 of what it was in 1885, but in 1887 it had fallen to about a third of what it was in 1885.\n\nBlachan was only about one-seventh in 1886 of what it was in 1885, and the quantity had only slightly risen again in 1887, though, from its better quality, it was worth nearly double that of 1886, though it is still less than a quarter the value of that of 1885.\n\nFish and prawns shell manure was in 1886 only about one-tenth of that in 1885, but again rose in 1887 to about one-half of what it was in 1885.\n\nComparing the two years, 1886 and 1887, there seems to have been an improvement in 1887 over 1886 under every heading except dried prawns, and the fish about which the people specially complained is more than double what it was in 1886, and more even than it was in 1885. It would, therefore, seem, from this return, that the prawn-fishing is really all they have just cause to complain about at present. I am inclined to think it is only a temporary scarcity; but, if it turns out, after watching the returns for a few more years, to be permanent, I do not think it will be a matter for great surprise, considering the constant shovelling up of these creatures by the million in the Strings and Sungkars, besides the large number that are caught in the Pukat Lengkongs and small Blats.\n\nIt is only in 1887 that they fell off: had the quantity remained anything like that of 1886, then the total value of the fishery export for 1887, instead of being only $43,750, would have been about $63,000, only $10,000 short of 1885, an increase of about $14,000 on 1886. As it is the grand total for 1887 only shows a decrease on 1886 of less than $6,000.\n\nPrawns are the most valuable product of the fishery, fetching, as I have stated in paragraph 28, from $7.50 to $10 per pikul, and, consequently, a bad prawn year makes an enormous deficit in the fishermen's profits.\nTelok Rubiah.\n\nTelok Rubiah, situated on the coast about 6 or 8 miles to the South of Kwala Kurau, is a small fishing village of about eighteen houses, some of which are, however, unoccupied at present, with about thirty-five or forty fishermen\u2014Hokkiens. The oldest inhabitant, Kow Chung, the farmer, has lived there for twenty-four years. He states that the fish has been scarce for about two and-a-half years, but he has known this happen before several times, the fish coming and going. Some of the people have, in consequence, gone to Pangkor (Dindings), Bernam, and Lower Perak, until good times return. Before, there were thirty or thirty-five Pukat Hanyut nets here, but now there are only seventeen or eighteen. The people here only use Pukat Hanyut and Blat Langei, no other Blats or Jerumals; they also use the Siring Udang a good deal.\n\nThe sea here is constantly encroaching, washing away the land. During Kow Chung's time, the site of the village has had to be shifted four times, being gradually washed away, and they will have soon to move again for the fifth time.\n\nThere is no river or stream here, and, after their supply of rain water, kept in tubs, has given out in the dry season, they bring water either from Matang, Larut, or Pulau Jerejak, Penang. The health of the fishermen, like that of those at Kwala Kurau, is very good, the abominable smells proceeding from the fish and prawns in process of being cured, and more especially from the manufacture of Blachan, and in the thick of which they live and sleep, having no neutralising effect on the really healthy out-at-sea part of their lives. I think Chinamen like smells, and that they do them good. I have felt before now considerable inconvenience when three miles to leeward of one of these fishing villages, and I unpleasantly remembered my two hours' sojourn in the close atmosphere of Kow Chung's house, surrounded with packages of blachan, &c., for days afterwards.\n\nThe people here pay no rent to Government for the land on which their houses are built; it would be hard if they did, seeing that the sites of their houses are washed away every few years. Neither do they pay one-tenth of the value of their\nfish to the farmer. I suppose the farmer could claim it if he liked, but has never yet asked for it. The people here, with the exception of grumbling a little at the scarcity of fish, and at having to pay for licenses for nets, boats, &c., had little to complain of. The farmer, old Kow Chung, however, stated that, in the old days of the Sultan, he only had to pay $1 per ball duty on opium and was allowed to cook it himself. Now he has to pay $7 per ball to the coast farmer. There were no other taxes at all formerly, and now the proceeds of the fishing only produce about $8 per month profit for each man\u2014a large fall from the $20 and more sometimes gained by each in good times, but nevertheless sufficient, I think, to live on comfortably with a little to spare. The farmer has to pay to the farmer at Kwala Kurau $25 per month for his license to sell chandoo. He buys it at $1.35 and sells it at $1.50 per tael. He says he is now losing money, as he only sells about 110 taels per month.\n\nThree years ago the crocodiles were very bad here. One man had his leg bitten very badly and was sent to Penang, where it was amputated, and he is still living and has gone to Trong, Larut, and lives with Malays, attap-making. Three men were afterwards bitten in one day. The Malay paddy-planters at the place (only about seven families) then arranged to call a Pawang from Perak to charm away the crocodiles and to bring back the former prosperity to their crops. Each Malay house subscribed 25 cents, and every Chinaman in the fishing village subscribed 30 cents. This was to pay for the buffalo for the sacrifice, the Pawang's expenses being paid by the Malays. The son-in-law of the former Datoh Ali of Kurau called the Pawang. The ceremony took place, and there have been no crocodiles there ever since and the Malays' crops improved.\n\nThere is no separate account kept of the export of fish from Telok Rubiah. They declare their cargoes at Kwala Kurau, running in there to take out port clearances, and the declared amount of fish is entered in the Kwala Kurau book as if it was Kwala Kurau fish.\nTanjong Piandang.\n\nAt Tanjong Piandang there is a fishing village of about twenty houses with thirty or forty fishermen. They only catch prawns. About fifteen years ago, in Datoh Ali's time, there were about two hundred men there, and they used nets also; and people from Nibong Tebal used to come and put up Blats there. The people, who had always had the reputation of being a lawless, turbulent lot, and from whose numbers it was notorious that gang robbers, thieves and other criminals were recruited, at last brought matters to a crisis about four years ago by attacking the Police when they came there to make an arrest. As a punishment the Government sent a force of Police there to burn the village down, which was accordingly done. At that time there were about one hundred fishermen. The village has been partially rebuilt, but now, as I have said above, there are only about thirty or forty men, all (but one) Te-Chius. The exception is an old Hokkien, named Ooi In, who has been living there for thirty-nine years and is seventy years old\u2014the oldest inhabitant.\n\nIn Datoh Ali's time the farmer paid $10 per month and was allowed to cook his own opium and spirits. The fishermen then paid no taxes at all.\n\nThe people complain that the prawns have got very short in quantity. They have got scarce before, but never to such an extent as during the last four years. They say that, before the last four years, each man could get $6, $7 or $8 profit per month, and that now often they do not get enough to buy sufficient rice to eat. They cannot account in any way for the prawns getting short, but do not think the big fish eat them and cause the scarcity.\n\nThere are a good many crocodiles, and perhaps they eat them, they say. A man was killed by one about eight years ago, but no further harm seems to have been done up to about three years ago, since which time two men have been bitten, but no one killed.\n\nSometimes they get a Pawang to come and pray and charm\nthem, and the reptiles get good for a time, but it does not last long.\n\nLike Telok Rubiah, the village has had to be moved a great many times, owing to the encroachments of the sea. The people in this fishing village are not charged house rent by Government, nor does the farmer claim one-tenth the value of the fish taken, as I suppose he might do if he liked.\n\nThese fishermen were all originally agricultural Sinkheh coolies, and, on their agreements expiring, took to this means of making a living, not being strong men nor fitted for work requiring much strength nor for carrying heavy weights.\n\n(Note.\u2014For export returns see table at end.)\n\nSungei Bharu.\n\nAt Sungei Bharu there are only about twenty Chinese fishermen, all prawn-catchers. There were many more formerly, and the people complain of the prawns having got scarce lately. The export return is included in that of Tanjong Piandang.\n\nBagan Tiang.\n\nAt Bagan Tiang is a very small and miserable Chinese fishing village of about fifteen houses. They are all Te-Chius, and work six Pukat Lengkong and Siring Udang, and carry fish to Parit Buntar for sale. There are only about thirty of these fishermen. There are, however, 19 Blat Jerumal, 3 Blat Kombang, 1 Blat Telok, worked by Malays under advances chiefly to Chinamen in Penang. There must thus be a very considerable amount of fish taken here, and the reason that the export return shows so little is that it is only cured fish that is entered in the export book, and nearly all the fish taken here is taken direct from the Blats, &c., over to Penang, and sold fresh, it fetching a higher price than salt fish. Boats also come over from Penang to the fishing stakes, and buy up all they can get and run straight away with it.\n\nSome time ago a small steamer tried its luck in running over here for fish, but I believe it was a losing venture. Some\nof the fish is also taken up to Simpang Ampat, Nibong Tebal and Parit Buntar and sold fresh.\n\nMany of the people here declare the fish is much scarcer than it used to be. Unfortunately the export return for this part of the district throws no light whatever on the subject, for, as I have said, nearly all the fish is taken away (fresh) without ever being reported.\n\nThe export account, such as it is, however, is quite untrustworthy, being kept by careless Malay clerks over whom no supervision seems to have ever been exercised.\n\nFor instance, in glancing through the export account book for 1886, I noticed an entry \"4,000 catties of dried prawns, value $40.\" Knowing that dried prawns are worth about $10 per pikul, I at once brought this to the clerk's notice, and he agreed with me, that it was evidently meant for $400. Thus, in this single instance alone, the return shows only one-tenth the value it should have, and, if this is a fair sample of the way the accounts are kept, they are not much to be depended on. The clerk, however, says this mistake was made by his predecessor.\n\nThe farmer here does not exact one-tenth of the value of the fish taken, as I suppose he is entitled to do. He would need to be a sharp man to collect it from the Jerumal and Blat men, who run their fish over to Penang.\n\nPenghulu Lebby Lah, who has lived there thirty years, says it is always the same, the fish come and go with the seasons (monsoons); that many people declare the fish has got scarcer altogether, but that he cannot tell. If they are scarcer, perhaps it is because there are too many people fishing, he says. People come over from Penang and fish here, and there are all our own coast people at work too.\n\nThe Krani tells me that only nineteen licenses to catch fish with hook and line (panching) have been taken out. Now, according to Mr. Creagh's new regulation (marked B, paragraph 2) each person using any other means (besides stakes) of catching fish or prawns is to take out a license, for which he will be charged 60 cents half-yearly. A number of Malays came to me about this when the new regulations were\nissued, with the usual story about being very poor\u2014baniak miskin, &c.,\u2014and that it was very hard lines, &c. I could only explain to them that Mr. Creagh had taken a whole year to decide about this matter, and that it must, therefore, have been well thought out, and that paragraph 2 was so clear that every one taking fish by any other means than blats was to pay 60 cents half-yearly, that they undoubtedly must take out licenses for line fishing (panching ikan).\n\nNow, it is ridiculous to suppose that there are only nineteen people line fishing on all this coast, and the inference is that just as many people fish as before, and that the order is simply ignored. The Malays say, with truth, that it is hard that they cannot go out and catch a fish for their dinners without taking out a license; but how is one to draw the line between such cases and those of the people who go out three or four in a boat, say, daily, and who all day long keep three or four lines over the side and take perhaps a pikul of the best fish, Selangin or Sinahong, &c.? The license only comes to 10 cents per month per man, and the sale of one catty of this fish about pays for it. Besides, the chances are that the man who only goes out, honestly enough perhaps, with the intention of catching a fish for his dinner, is not likely to resist the temptation of catching as many as he can if he finds them biting well. There are, I know, a great many men always employed in this way, and they sell their fish out at sea to the jerumal or blat men or the Penang boats, and make a good living out of it.\n\nThe Malays and Chinese have both conjectured that the alleged scarcity is caused by too many people fishing. If so, to repeal this light tax would act as a further incentive to every man, woman and child to renew their efforts to make matters worse; whereas a little judicious raiding by the Police now and then, leading to the occasional fining of one of the offenders, will, I have no doubt, stop a good deal of it, to the improvement of the fishery for those who invest capital in it and make a regular business of it, and to the increase of the revenue. I do not see any reason why the trade of the regular professional fishermen, Chinese and Malays, who pay\ntheir taxes and other licenses honestly for their privileges of using nets and fishing stakes, should be ruined, or, let us say, damaged, by men paying nothing.\n\nFinal Remarks.\n\nIf any reliance can be placed on the Kwala Kurau export account above, it would seem that the actual quantity of fish has not much, if at all, fallen off in this district, but that the prawns, the most remunerative part of the fishery, have decreased very much during the last two years, but that there is nothing to show whether the decrease is of a permanent or only of a temporary nature.\n\nIf, in the course of two or three years more, the decrease is found to be of a permanent nature, the nature and habits of the prawn in these seas will have to be studied, in order to protect it and encourage its breeding, if necessary by establishing a close season and the same will apply to the fish, if it also should get alarmingly scarce.\n\nHowever, notwithstanding the favourable aspect of the salt fish return in the Kwala Kurau book, there is no doubt that there is a general complaint of the scarcity of fish throughout the district, whether wholly true, partially true, or false, I cannot say, but I am inclined to think that there is a good deal in it, as I hear the same report from Penang; and, when on a recent visit to Pangkor, I was told that there had been a great scarcity of fish ever since I gave up charge of the Dindings, in the middle of 1886, and there are now not half the number of fishermen there that there used to be.\n\nI would suggest that Outshore Stakes, i.e., Blat Jerumal, Blat Kombang, and Blat Batawei, should not be fixed in depth of more than $3\\frac{1}{2}$ fathoms (low water spring tides), nor should each fishing stake be situated at less than 400 fathoms from any other fishing stake, nor should it exceed 300 fathoms in length.\n\nInshore Stakes, i.e., every other kind of stakes, also Pompongs, should not be fixed in a depth of more than $2\\frac{1}{2}$ fathoms (low water spring tides), nor should each fishing stake be situated less than 200 fathoms from any other fishing stake, and should not exceed 120 fathoms in length.\nIt will be seen that an outshore *blat* is more than twice the length of an inshore *blat*, and it is, therefore, only fair that the same charge should not be made for both.\n\nI would further suggest that the use or possession of the murderous *Rawei*, with its 1,000 or 2,000 hooks, should be made illegal.\n\nKRIAN, PERAK,\n\n21st April, 1888.\n\nARTHUR T.

RIDLEY, M.A., F.L.S.\n\nIn a naturalist\u2019s eyes there is always a peculiar interest attaching to an oceanic island. For, owing to its isolation, we are able to obtain many clues to obscure points in the distribution and development of species, by investigating its fauna and flora.\n\nIn speaking of an oceanic island, I mean one which has, as far as we know, arisen by volcanic or other action from the sea, and is not merely a detached portion of an adjacent continent, or of a continent which has in lapse of time been destroyed. Under this category come most, if not all, of the chain of islands which lie scattered throughout the Atlantic Ocean far away from land, such as the Azores, Canaries, Madeira, Cape Verde, Fernando de Noronha, St. Paul\u2019s Rocks, Tristan d\u2019Acunha, St. Helena, South Trinidad and Martin Vaz, the Crozets, Diego Garcia, and, farther East, Cocos and Christmas Islands. The plants and animals inhabiting nearly all these islands have now been pretty well explored, and good accounts, especially of the plants, have been published by various travellers and naturalists. Mr. Hemsley has collected all the work done on the botany of these islands, and added much thereto in the great work of \u201cThe Voyage of the Challenger.\u201d One or two, however, remain to be more thoroughly examined, as at present but little is known of them. These are South Trinidad and its companion Martin Vaz lying off the coast of Brazil, and Christmas Island, now a British Colony attached to the Straits Settlements.\nChristmas Island was visited by H. M. S. Flying Fish in 1887, and by H. M. S. Egeria in the year 1888, and Mr. J. J. Lister, who remained on the island for a week, made considerable collections of the plants and animals there, accounts of which were published in the Journals of the Linnean and Zoological Society. Much, however, remains to be done, and it was with great pleasure that I found myself last August in H. M. S. Redpole bound for Christmas Island. Unfortunately the vessel was only able to remain there for the inside of one day, so that I could not get more than a glimpse of its flora and fauna. Many of the trees and shrubs were out of flower at that time too, so that I was unable to get specimens of them. I managed, however, to make several additions to the list of plants published by Mr. Hemslcy from Mr. Lister's collections. Among the most interesting of which was a very pretty new orchid, Saccolabium archytas.\n\nViewed from the sea, near Flying Fish Cove, the island appeared as a long straight ridge rising abruptly from the sea, and densely covered with high forest, the deep green of which is dotted with white specks\u2014the innumerable nesting sea-fowl\u2014while here and there orange-red patches of the bloom of a handsome coral-tree (Erythrina).\n\nThe whole island is about nine miles across, and its highest point is nearly 1,200 feet above sea level. The cliffs are mostly abrupt, but in some places are patches of beach, composed of broken coral, shells and stones. The surrounding seas are very deep, and there are but few spots shallow enough for anchorage of a large ship.\n\nOn the beach at Flying Fish Cove, Mr. Andrew Ross has established his little colony, at present consisting of 15 persons, and is cultivating coffee, coco-nuts and vegetables, for which purpose the brown soil saturated with guano is well suited.\n\nThe core of the island is said to be composed of volcanic rock, and I saw a few pebbles on the beach consisting of some kind of trap, but though I ascended to the top of the ridge, I saw none of the rock in situ. The whole island is covered with coral-limestone, a hard yellowish rock emitting a ringing sound when struck. In many places it occurs in the form of\ncliffs rising one above the other, shewing that the island has been slowly and gradually elevated from the sea bottom. Where the upper surface is exposed it weathers into pinnacles and curiously shaped angular projections, and though weathering externally into holes, the inner portions are usually homogeneous. I did not see any fossils in it, but the distinguishable remains of shells and coral would probably be found, if sought for.\n\nExactly similar rock occurs in Fernando de Noronha, an island lying off the East coast of Brazil, which I visited in 1887, and with which Christmas Island has many points in common. This coral rock has been described by Mr. Branner in some notes on the petrology of Fernando de Noronha, published lately in the American Journal of Science as being derived from sand-dunes hardened by carbonate of lime. He shows, however, by analysis that it consists almost entirely of carbonate of lime with a very small proportion of silica which would at once negative that suggestion. Furthermore, it was quite easy to find at Fernando de Noronha spots where the coral-reef, which was still growing at the outer edge in the sea, passed into the compact ringing rock with no distinguishable organic remains in it. It is true that on Fernando de Noronha there are sand-dunes which might, and indeed had in one place, become hardened more or less into rock, not much resembling, however, the limestone, but in Christmas Island there is no level place on which could develope sand-dunes sufficiently extensive to form the immense mass of rock of which the greater portion of the island consists.\n\nOn our return from Christmas Island to Singapore we stopped for an hour or two at Anjer Point in Java, opposite the volcanic island Krakatau, of which so large a portion was destroyed by an eruption a few years ago. Anjer Point was then struck by an enormous wave which overthrew the lighthouse and caused a great loss of life. On the shore near the remains of the old lighthouse are some very large blocks of stone which, I was informed, were thrown up there from Krakatau, when in eruption. However, on examining them, I found they were masses of ordinary coral reef, which were probably thrown up from the sea by the large wave. They were\nquite of the same nature as the Christmas Island rock as far as I could make out, but the organic remains were plainly visible and the rock less compact.\n\nThe soil which covers the rock beds in the forest is powdery, and dark brown, strongly impregnated with guano from the droppings of the numerous sea birds nesting upon the trees very similar to that of Fernando de Noronha. The forest is composed of a large variety of trees, many of very large size and producing good timbers, among them was the Gayam (*Inocarpus edulis*), species of *Eugenia* and *Ficus*, *Sideroxylon sundaicum*, an *Erythrina* with very small but brilliant orange flowers, and several other kinds of which I was unable to procure enough material to identify. The trees are clothed with ferns of several species, orchids and a wax-plant (*Hoya Aldrichii*, Hemsl.) which is called by the colonists the Flower of Paradise, from its beauty. It is very abundant, but I saw no trace of fruit or flowers, and had to content myself with bringing home some living plants. The orchids were abundant, too, the most common being a new species to which I have given the name of *Saccolabium archytas*. It has thick bright green leaves and long racemes of small white flowers spotted with pink. Besides these there was a *Dendrobium* of the *Cadetia* section, *D. crumenatum*, the well-known pigeon-orchid, a curious new species of *Sarcochilus* and what appeared to be one of the *Phreatias* described from Lister's collection by Mr. Rolfe. None of these latter were in flower at the time of my visit, but I secured live plants, and the *Sarcochilus* has since flowered in Singapore.\n\nThe pigeon-orchid is one of the most widely distributed of tree orchids in the East Indian region, and I was much surprised to pass a large number of plants apparently of this species quite fresh and green floating in the sea between Singapore and Batavia. One does not imagine that so delicate a plant as an orchid could survive prolonged immersion in the sea.\n\nTerrestrial orchids were represented by *Corymbis veratrifolia*, Bl., also a very widely distributed species occurring in Western Africa, Assam, all over the Malay Peninsula and on the Malay Archipelago. It is true that Blume in his \"Or-\nchids of the Indian Archipelago\" distinguishes the African, Assamese and Malayan plants as three distinct plants, but the distinguishing characters appear to me too slight, especially as the plant is evidently a very variable one. I recently found specimens in Pulau Ubin near Singapore which were quite indistinguishable from some of the African forms.\n\nFerns are very abundant. Mr. Lister collected fifteen species, two of which, viz., an Asplenium and an Acrostichum were new to science. The ground beneath the bigger trees in the forest produced many shrubs and small plants, among which were Anisomeles ovata, a large straggling herb with purple flowers like a large dead nettle; and another horehound-like Labiate with white flowers, a shrubby species of Achyranthes, Ehretia buxifolia, Laportea crenulata, Gaud., a tree nettle with stinging petioles, clumps of Pandani, Oplismenus compositus, Fleurya aestuans, and other plants. A Randia, perhaps of an undescribed species, formed coffee-like bushes with small white flowers and orange berries. It is evidently allied to R. densiflora which is also stated to occur here, but entirely different from that species in its smaller size of parts and habit. Ochrosia Ackeringae, Miq., is a small Apocynaceous tree with white flowers and twin yellow fruits. In more open places near the shore were a tall Mallow (Abutilon sp.), with fairly large buff flowers, one of the common tree vines (Leea sambucina, L.) resembling an elder bush, and a scrambling bryony with small flowers (Zehneria mucronata, Miq.) and on the sandy spots by the shore were the common Waroo (Hibiscus tiliaceus), the goat's foot convolvulus (Ipomea pes-caprae), Sc\u00e6vola Koenigii, L., and Ischoemum foliosum Hack var. leiophyllum. This grass was identified for me by Professor Hackel, who says, that this is a new variety differing from the type only in the glabrous leaves. This type is only known from New Caledonia.\n\nThe native palm (Arenga Listeri, Becc.) is plentiful, especially on the lower ground near the sea. It is a beautiful species about twenty feet in height with a stout green stem about four inches through, smooth except for the rings. The leaves are large, pinnate, light green above and glaucous beneath. The fruits resemble coffee-berries and are\nbright red, each containing three seeds. They are peculiarly irritating even when handled like those of *Caryota urens* and *Kentia Macarthuri*. The tree produces a very excellent sago which is used as food by Mr. Ross' party. Indeed Christmas Island produces, for an island of its size, a remarkably large supply of natural vegetable and animal food, for besides the sago, there are plenty of Gayam (*Inocarpus edulis*) and Indian almonds (*Terminalia catappa*) both eatable and excellent fruits; while land crabs, pigeons and frigate birds supply plenty of animal food.\n\nThe birds of the island are somewhat interesting. A pretty brown ground thrush with a red abdomen was very abundant and tame, hopping about everywhere, and small green warblers (*Zosterops natalis*, Sharpe) flew about in little flocks and were very bold and fearless. A small brown hawk like a kestrel (*Urospizias natalis*, Sharpe) appeared on one occasion and fell to the gun. But the attraction to the party who landed from the Redpole lay in the pigeons, of which there were two species, one resembling the common green pigeon, the other a large blue dove, known as *Carphophaga Whartonii*, peculiar to this island. This is a very beautiful bird allied to the common Pergam (*C. \u00e6nea*), but of a rich deep blue colour. It is very abundant especially on the top of the hill, and towards sunset the woods resounded with its loud note. It sits high up in the lofty trees and is by no means easy to see. It is a very strong bird, several receiving four complete charges of shot before dropping and, like the common Pergam, is tough and not worth eating, but as an ornamental bird it has been successfully introduced into the Cocos Islands by Mr. Ross.\n\nOf the marine birds, the Frigate Bird (*Fregata aquila*), tropic birds (*Phaethon flavirostris*) and boobies (*Sula piscatrix*) were very abundant nesting on the trees and filling the air with their fishy odour. The Frigate Bird is, we found, very good eating, having dark brown flesh with a good and not fishy flavour. Towards evening the great fox bats (*Pteropus natalis*, Thom.), began to appear and clung squeaking to the branches of the trees which were in fruit. They are quite different from the common fox bat, being entirely black. I saw\nalso a small insectivorous bat flying about, but could not catch it.\n\nThe native rats, *Mus Maclearii* and *M. nativitatis*, Thom., do not appear till dark, and as we left before sunset we could not secure any specimens. There are several kinds of lizards here, two of which I caught; one was a very dark, coloured gecko inhabiting the old stumps and rotten trees lying on the ground. As is constantly the case in islands and especially in oceanic islands there are no snakes here, though Mr. Ross has seen, he tells me, their skeletons washed up on shore. But the most conspicuous denizens of the forest are the large blue and red land crabs (*Birgus latro*) which are exceedingly abundant living in holes in the ground, but constantly wandering about in the woods. Insects are not numerous. I noticed three species of butterfly, a yellow Terias, (*T. amplexa*) a Hypolimnias and what was probably the endemic species *Vadebra Maclearii*, but I could only get a single specimen of the first named species. Mr. Ross presented me with a pair of very fine maroon-coloured hawkmoths, and told me that there was another and much finer kind to be met with of which he hoped to secure specimens. Of other insects I saw an abundant species of small red wasp, and a fine large Buprestid beetle, of a light but brilliant green colour glittering all over, and a large green larval mantis, too young to identify.\n\nI append a list of all the animals and plants recorded, as far as I know, from the island, and hope that Mr. Ross, who takes much interest in his insular home, will be enabled to assist us in getting a more complete idea of the fauna and flora of Christmas Island.\nList of Animals and Plants recorded from Christmas Island.\n\n[Note:\u2014In this list all endemic plants and animals are printed in italics.

Leaves fleshy oblong-elliptic slightly unequally bilobed blunt at the lip, bright green very strongly keeled especially at the base, two inches long one inch across; the base flattened laterally so as to form a broad flat petiole; sheath very deeply cleft on side opposite to lamina, when dry strongly ribbed. Scapes very graceful erect slender pale green about six inches long with one or two small sheathing bracts. Raceme of few flowers, opening one or two at a time, rachis thickened terete; bracts lanceate acute; green \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) of an inch in length; flowers small thin textured, white withering buff; ovary and pedicel \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch long, straight bright green. Posticus sepal lanceolate acuminate with recurved apex, laterals similar but the base prolonged below into an angle, keeled outside. Petals shorter linear lanceolate. Lip white base prolonged to form a blunt spur, lateral lobes very long narrow linear acuminate, midlobe shorter thick ovate blunt; a lorate raised ridge on the disc ending in a blunt rounded callus on the midlobe; a yellow spot on the base of the lip outside. Column straight thick with a distinct foot, clinandrium nearly flat, wings of column bent over the face,\nfoot linear upcurved. Another quadrate rounded at the top front edge truncate straight. Pollinia four unequal oval flattened with a small oval disc. Stigma deep oval; rostellum small.\n\nA curious little plant, which bears no very distinct relation to any other species I know, but is probably an ally of *S. leopardinus*, Par., or at all events belongs to the section which includes this plant.\n\n*Saccolabium Archytas*. nsp.\n\nStems short usually crowded in large masses with very many roots. Leaves lorate few, bright green, apices unequally bilobed, with blunt lobes, six inches long, by one broad. Racemes pendulous covered with small flowers, four to six inches long with a rather slender angled green rachis. Bracts short ovate acute. Flowers hardly $\\frac{1}{2}$ inch across, opening a few at a time, ovary and pedicel $\\frac{1}{2}$ inch long white, terete. Dorsal sepal narrow oblong obtuse boat-shaped, laterals obcuneate subtriangular. Petals spathulate with a broad obtuse apex, shorter than the sepals. All white. Lip small with side-lobes large and rounded white with violet spots, midlobe absent. Spur large straight dependent blunt. Column base narrow, above dilated, white with a violet face. Anther ovate acute in front, yellow. Pollen masses two globose pale yellow, pedicel linear rather broad, disc ovate. Capsule slender elongate three inches long, ribs not much elevated.\n\nThis is a pretty little plant although the flowers are so small. It is remarkable for the subtriangular sepals and the lip being reduced almost to a spur with the lateral lobes flanking the mouth.\n\n**Summary.**\n\nThe fauna and flora is typically Malayan as might be expected from the position of the island, and is evidently primarily derived from the coasts of Java which is the nearest land. Perhaps when the southern regions of Java are better worked out we shall find some of the peculiar Christmas Island species occurring there.\nThe greater part of the plants fall under one of the two heads, those whose seeds or fruits are carried about unharmed by sea currents, and those which having edible fruits are dispersed by birds. These in fact are the two methods by which most of the oceanic islands are populated. To the first class belong *Hibiscus tiliaceus*, *Inocarpus edulis*, *Terminalia Catappa*, *Barringtonia racemosa*, *Pemphis acidula*, *Ochrosia*, *Ackeringa*, *Cordia subcordata*, *Tournefortia argentea*, *Ipomea pes caprae*, *Boerhaavia repanda*, *Hernandia ovigera*, *Pandanus*, sp., *Fimbristylis cymosa*, and probably also *Erythrina*, *Abutilon*, *Ehretia buxifolia* and *Tectona*. *Dendrobium crumenatum* and the other orchids may have been derived from plants drifted ashore on fallen trees.\n\nAs fruit-eating birds and bats are very numerous it is not to be wondered at that there are many species with edible fruits, which have been brought to the island by them. To this class belong *Vitis*, *Leea*, *Zehneria*, *Heptapleurum*, *Randia*, *Psychotria*, *Ardisia*, *Solanum*, *Callicarpa*, *Deeringia*, *Ficus*, *Didymosperma* and probably also *Eugenia*, *Sideroxylon*, *Euphorbia*, and *Cleidion*. The fruits of *Didymosperma* are as stated above very irritating but this is no bar to their being devoured by birds. The fruits of *Kentia Macarthuri*, a New Guinea palm, are nearly as irritating, but they are greedily eaten by the blue starlings in the Botanic Gardens, at Singapore and I found, in Fernando de Noronha, a species of *Sapium* which was so poisonous that the fruit falling on a horse would blister the skin, yet it was often eaten by small birds.\n\nA few species have been introduced accidentally by man into Christmas Island, and this class will doubtless increase largely. Nearly all of these occur close to the Settlements. They include *Hibiscus Abelmoschus*, *Spilanthes*, *Datura*, *Achyranthes aspera*, *Eleusine*, *Digitaria* and perhaps *Abutilon indicum*. Such plants as *Pisonia excelsa* with its sticky fruits, *Achyranthes* sp. and *Oplismenus* may have been borne to the island by birds, as their fruits are more or less adhesive.\n\nIt might be imagined that winged or plumed seeds would be easily carried to distant islands and consequently form an important element in the flora. This is not so. In the majo-\nrity of cases these seeds are carried a short way only and even if they were widely scattered by prolonged and violent winds, they would have but little chance of accidentally striking an island far off in the sea. To the class with plumed seeds belong *Hoya Aldrichii*, and *Blumea spectabilis*. Both may have been introduced by wind-currents.\n\nOrchids are acknowledged to be rare in Oceanic Islands although their minute seeds are blown from the split capsules for a considerable distance. Perhaps that the Christmas Island species were in this manner drifted to their present home, but it is also possible that the epiphytic species were floated there on logs of fallen trees.\n\nFerns, the spores of which are produced in enormous quantities and are exceedingly light, are certainly widely scattered by the blowing of their spores to long distances, and the same remark applies to Fungi, Mosses and other Cellular Cryptogams.\nList of Papers Published on Christmas Island.\n\nProc.

Cox, while walking on a road at the barracks at Tanglin, picked up from among the laterite which was being put on the road a large stone implement, which he has presented to the Museum. The weapon is five inches in length and nearly four inches across and about one and a half thick in the thickest part. It is oblong, with one end abruptly truncate, the other ground off to a rounded cutting edge. It is a good deal worn, and at one spot bears a small coral, showing that it had recently come from the sea. It is of a dark chocolate-brown externally, but by dipping it a little at one corner it was found to be composed of a very hard compact granite containing very small flakes of mica. On enquiry I found that the contractor who was laying down the laterite had obtained it from Tanjong Karang on the West Coast of Singapore. This spot I have since visited, and found that the stone was being taken from below high water mark, which would account for the presence of the coral upon the specimen. Tanjong Karang is a small promontory, consisting of a core of rather hard iron-stone, covered with about two feet of humus and gravelly soil. There is what is called a Kramat at the corner nearest to the spot whence the specimen must have come, but this Kramat merely consists of a detached block of iron-stone, which in shape more or less resembles a tomb. The overlying soil on the promontory has so shifted from denudation that it is impossible to get any idea of its age; fragments of modern pottery occurring even at the part where it rests on the iron-stone. I sought carefully for any more weapons, but could find none, and indeed it was hardly to be expected, as they are almost always found singly here.\nHitherto, as far as I am aware, no worked stone of this class has ever been found in Singapore, though stone implements have been obtained in some numbers in Perak and Pahang, where they are known as Batu Linta. These latter are generally made of a black igneous rock, and of a narrower form than the present one. The form, however, of a stone axe must always depend on the texture and hardness of the stone and its cleavage. And the exceedingly hard texture of this granite is, no doubt, the reason for its broad shape. The edge has evidently been ground very carefully, but not equally, one side being flatter than the other. From this I gather that the weapon was used as an adze or biliong.\n\nOf what race were the makers of these weapons we are entirely ignorant, none of the wild tribes use stone weapons, nor do they know anything about those that are found in the Peninsula. Nor is the stone of which the Pahang specimens are made, known at all from this region. It is probable that these were brought from farther East, but the Singapore specimen is made of granite, and of such granite as is found at no great distance from Tanjong Karang, namely, at Pulau Ubin, and I also found an outcrop of granite in one of the hills between Tanjong Karang and Toas. It is probable, therefore, that it was made on or near the spot where it was found, possibly from a sea-shore pebble of granite from the neighbourhood of Pulau Ubin.\n\nH. N. R.\n\nPANTANG LARANG OF NEGRI SEMBILAN.\n\nThe Yam Tuan Besar of Negri Sembilan has recently caused to be published certain rules for the conduct of the Malays of that State. These rules\u2014Pantang Larang\u2014are not new, but are some of the old rules of the State. They are now published to show the masses that the Malay customs are in full force as hitherto. The following is a translation:\n\nIt is forbidden\u2014\n1. To fire guns or cannons during the three days previous to either of the great feasts called Hari Raia or Hari Raia Haji, i.e., on the 28th, 29th or 30th of Jal Haija.\n\n2. To disobey a lawful order of the Raja or Penghulu.\n\n3. For any one to wear clothes of the colours which are set apart as the special colour attached to the Rajaship, or to any State office, such as yellow, which is the Raja's colour; or to carry the hair-ornamented spear, or to wear entirely black clothing, which may only be the dress of officers such as the Laksamana.\n\n4. For any person to make use of and display weapons or articles similar to the insignia of a Chief or State officer, as such insignia.\n\n5. To recite the form of prayer called Hothbah, except at the Istana, Penghulu's or Lembaga's Court-house, Mosque, or at any other place specially set apart by the Raja or Penghulu.\n\n6. For any person to wear weapons having gold or silver ornaments covering either the end of the handle or of the sheath, except by permission or rank.\n\n7. To arrange his house or premises similarly to a royal hall, called Balei jariga, which is fenced round with split runyong (the Kabong tree) according to the ancient custom in the country of Menangkabau, with gates roofed (i.e., with an arch over them), with the exception of persons who are permitted by the Raja or Penghulu.\n\n8. The big drum of the Mosque is not to be beaten, except on feast days or on the occasion of any public calamity, or at a calling together of the people.\n\nDahga Dahgi. This means that the people of low rank must never disobey the orders of those of higher rank than themselves.\n\nSumbang Salah. This means that the children of two women who are sisters cannot marry each other. It is against the law of the country.\nChelaka Derahka means that whosoever disobeys these orders shall be considered guilty of treason.\n\nWhoever disobeys the aforesaid rules is liable to a fine not exceeding twenty-five dollars.\n\nM. L.\n\nON THE OCCURRENCE OF A RHODODENDRON IN SINGAPORE.\n\nIn January of this year, while walking near the bungalow on the top of Bukit Timah with Lieutenant KELSALL, I observed in the upper branches of a lofty Dipterocarpous tree, probably a species of Shorea, an epiphytic plant with red flowers. On going to the foot of the tree we picked up several fallen blossoms, from which it was evident that the plant was a species of Rhododendron, and that, one not known to occur in the Malay Peninsula. The tree was about 150 feet high, and about 6 feet through, without a branch for fully 80 feet, so that it was by no means easy to reach it. The following plan was then adopted. A number of large spike nails were driven into the tree, and a pole lashed to them so as to form a ladder, for about a quarter of a distance. A Malay then ascended this with a further supply of nails, and a pulley block being fixed to the tree another pole was hauled up and made fast to the lower one. This was done again and again till the lowest branch was reached, and eventually the plant was lowered to the ground. There were two plants on the tree, which were transferred to the Botanic Gardens, where one remained a long time in flower. The plant is an exceedingly beautiful one, with clusters of nodding flowers about two inches long, of a beautiful crimson-red colour. It appears to be identical with one figured in the Botanical Magazine under the name of Rhododendron javanicum var. tubiflorum (Tab. 9850), differing only in the colour, which in the picture is a very dull red. The plant from which this drawing was made was ob-\ntained by Mr. Curtis in Solok in Sumatra, and sent home to Mr. Veitch, who cultivated it in England. It seems, to me however, that this so-called variety is specifically quite distinct from *Rhododendron javanicum*, which is also a native of the Peninsula.\n\n*Rhododendron javanicum*, Benn., is based on a plant found in Java by Dr. Horsfield, and is figured and described in Bennett & Horsfield's *Plant\u00e6 Javanic\u00e6 Rariores* (Tab. xix), and I have what is evidently the same plant from Gunong Hijau in Perak, collected by Mr. Curtis, but the tube of the flowers is rather shorter and more infundibuliform. The Singapore plant differs from the true *javanicum* in the leaves, which are shorter, thicker and blunter and more conspicuously dotted with glands, and the base of the blade is not narrowed into the petiole, but ends abruptly. The flowers are nodding on rather long pedicels. The tube is very long in proportion to the limb, nearly 1\u00bd inch, the lobes of the limb are short, broad and rounded, about half an inch long. The tube is cylindric, slightly curved, and when alive grooved at the base, where, as in the Perak plant, it is almost funnel shaped, with very large lobes to the limb. The stamens again are much thinner, the anther only half the size. The style is thick and the stigma large and somewhat trilobed in the Perak plant and in Bennett's figure, whereas in our plant the style is thin, with a much smaller more simple stigma. These points are so marked, that it appears to me that the two plants should be specifically separated. It is very possible that the Singapore plant may be identical with *Rh. longiflorum*, Lindl, a plant which has been found in Borneo at sea level by Professor Beccari, whose description fits it fairly well, but I have not here Lindley's original description of that plant.\n\nBesides this species, there are four other kinds of *Rhododendron* in the Malay Peninsula.\n\n*Rh. malayanum*, Jack, which is the commonest, occurs on Mount Ophir, Gunong Hijau, and Maxwell's Hill, and in other mountains of the central range, and also in Sumatra, Java and Celebes. It is a straggling plant with small crimson flowers.\n\n*Rh. jasminiflorum*, Hook., with clusters of white jessamine-like flowers, only known from Mount Ophir.\nRh. Teysmanni, Miq., a yellow flowered plant, grows on Penang Hill. It is an ally of Rh. javanicum, Benn., which is the fourth species.\n\nAll these grow on the trees as epiphytes, usually at considerable altitudes, i.e., from 2,000 feet upwards.\n\nThe only other plant of the order Ericaceae yet recorded from the Peninsula is a Diplycosia microphylla, Becc., a remarkable little creeping plant, which appears to be common at high altitudes. It has more of the appearance of one of the bilberry family, with tough, wiry branches, and small oval leaves.\n\nThe allied orders of Vacciniaceae and Epacridae are represented respectively, in Singapore, by Vaccinium malaccense a bush of considerable size, with pink or white sweet-scented heather bell-shaped flowers, and small eatable black bilberries; and the remarkable Leucopogon malayanus, Jack, a large bush with hard, sharp-pointed leaves, very small white flowers, and sweet but very small orange berries. Both grow on sandy ground near Changi towards Tanah Merah, Leucopogon forming here dense thickets. Another species of Vaccinium also grows in Pekan, with longer and more crimson flowers.\n\nH. N. R.\n\nPOGONIA PUNCTATA, BL., IN SINGAPORE.\n\nThe genus of orchids Pogonia has not hitherto been recorded from the Malay Peninsula, but as the surrounding countries produce a number of species, it is not to be wondered at that at least one kind should occur here. Some months ago, I found in a stream on the western slope of Bukit Timah a small plant of some species of this genus, and by carefully transferring the small tuber with its solitary leaf to the Botanic Gardens, I was able to induce it at last to flower, when it proved to be P. punctata, Bl.\u2014a plant obtained by Blume from the slopes of Mount Pangrango in Java, and figured by\nhim in the \"Orchids of the Malay Archipelago\" (Tab. 42).\n\nThis plant belongs to the section of the genus in which the umbrella-shaped leaf appears alone, and, after remaining for a short time, suddenly withers and is followed by a stem bearing one or more flowers. In this species the leaf is about three inches tall, the blade being orbicular, cordate dark green and more or less purple beneath. The flower stem is about the same height, covered with sheaths, which are thickly dotted with purple, whence the trivial name. It bears a single nodding flower about an inch and a half long, with a purple ovary and a pale glower thickly spotted all over outside with purple. The petals and sepals are very narrow linear acute. The lip is white with violet spots. The flower has a faint scent of cucumbers. It never seems fully to open. Probably it is not so rare as it would appear, for, without doubt, it is an exceedingly difficult plant to find, as it is very inconspicuous and occurs apparently quite sporadically. I have several times since hunted in the spot where I found this little plant, and never seen any more.\n\nH. N. R.\n\nTHE KERINGGA.\n\nSince writing the account of the Caringa (more correctly Keringga) in the last number of the Journal, I have received a letter from Mr. WATERHOUSE, of the British Museum, in which he tells me that the specimens I sent him are *Ecophylla smaragdina* and not *Formica gracilipes*. It apparently takes its name of *smaragdina* (emerald green) from the curious dusk-green colour of the winged female. It is identical with the insect of Ceylon and Southern India.\n\nH. N. R.\n\nEUDROMIAS VEREDUS IN SINGAPORE.\n\nOn the 13th of May, 1891, the Museum Taxidermist, Mr. L. A. FERNANDEZ, saw a Malay boy capturing birds by\nmeans of hair nooses on the race course. On inspecting his captures, he found a pair of plovers \\( \\sigma \\) and \\( \\varphi \\) with which he was not acquainted; these he purchased for the very moderate sum of 10 cents for the pair, and they are now mounted. They prove to be *Eudromias veredus* of Gould., originally described P. Z. S., 1848, p. 38. The species is rare in this part of the world. It has been recorded once from the Andamans (S. F. I., 83) and once from the Sunderbunds. It however seems to occur not unfrequently in Java and the islands farther East.\n\nW. D.\n\nI may also note that when at Penang in May last I noticed a flight of about 20 birds of the rare tern *Sterna leucoptera*.\n\nW. D.\n\n---\n\n**FRUGIVOROUS HABITS OF THE TUPAIA.**\n\nThis little insectivore (*Tupaia javanensis*) is very common in Singapore, and especially in the Botanic Gardens, where it may be often seen running about among the trees. It is easily mistaken for the common little squirrel (*Sciurus hippurus*), of which it has much the appearance. When alarmed it quickly darts up the trunk of the nearest tree, but is a poor climber, and never seems to go high up like the squirrel. But besides these points of resemblance, it appears also to be largely frugivorous. It was found that the seeds sown in boxes were constantly being dug up and devoured by some animal, and traps baited with pieces of coco-nut or banana were set, and a number of tupaiaes were caught. These being put into a cage appear to live very comfortably upon bananas, pineapple, rice and other such things; refusing meat. The Rev. T. G. Wood, in his Natural History, states that *T. ferruginea* is said to feed on beetles, but to vary its diet with certain fruits. The common species here seems to be almost entirely frugivorous, though its teeth are those of a typical insectivore.\n\nH. N.

Frederick Dickson, K.C.M.G., who for five years has been President of the Society, and, by the great interest he has taken in the affairs and his own wide knowledge of Oriental literature, has contributed so much to the Society's success and progress.\n\nDuring the year, the following new members have been elected:\n\nMr. R. Dane.\nThe Hon'ble H. A. O'Brien.\nMr. H. von Papendrecht.\nMr. Justice Goldney.\nMr. E. A. Wise.\nMr. F. J. Owen.\nMr. E. B.

T. HAUGHTON,\nHonorary Treasurer.\nAN OLD MINUTE BY SIR STAMFORD RAFFLES.\n\nThe following interesting record was recently found amongst some old documents in the Singapore Treasury. It is signed by Sir Stamford Raffles, and the concluding portion of the minute as well as the final signature are in the handwriting of that officer. The date is June, 1823, still legible as when it was written, but the day of the date has been eaten out of the paper.\n\nThe Proclamation and the Minute which follows it may accordingly be accepted as one of the first official utterances of the founder of Singapore, after the transfer of the island from the Government of Bencoolen to that of Bengal some three years before its amalgamation with Penang and Malacca.\n\nApart from its intrinsic value as a state paper, this document is interesting when we compare and contrast the present state of our laws with the provisions there indicated and foreshadowed nearly seventy years ago.\n\nAs the Minute is reprinted in extenso, I need only draw the reader's special attention to the author's views upon gambling, prostitution, registration of deeds, adulteration, the sanctity of oaths, and municipal regulation, amongst many other points touched upon. The doctrine of the liability of publicans may raise a smile, but it is a theory which still finds support amongst the apostles of temperance in England, where the legal sanction of the publican's errors lies only in the hands of the exponents of the licensing laws.\nThe Lieutenant-Governor's views upon deportation will, no doubt, be read with interest at the present time: while his brief remarks upon the characteristics of the Malay race, which he knew so well, are as deserving of study and acceptance to-day as when they were penned.\n\nH. A. O'BRIEN.\n\nSingapore, 7th August, 1891.\n\nPROCLAMATION.\n\nProvision having been made by Regulations Nos. III and IV of 1823 for the establishment of an efficient Magistracy at Singapore and for the mode in which local Regulations having the force of Law should be enacted, and by whom such Laws should be administered, it now becomes necessary to state the principles and objects which should be kept in view in framing such Regulations, and, as far as circumstances may admit, to apprize all parties of their respective rights and duties, in order that ignorance thereof may not hereafter be pleaded on the part of any individual or class of people.\n\nThe Lieutenant-Governor is, in consequence, induced to give publicity to the following Minute containing the leading principles and objects to be attended to:\n\nMINUTE BY THE LIEUTENANT-GOVERNOR.\n\nAs the population of Singapore will necessarily consist of a mixture, in various proportions, of strangers from all parts of the world having commercial concerns at this Port, though chiefly of Chinese and Malays, it would be impracticable for any Judicial Authority to become perfectly acquainted with the Laws and Customs having the force of Law which are acknowledged in their own countries respectively by the varied classes of so mixed a population, and to administer them in such a manner as to preserve them inviolate even in the mutual intercourse of those classes severally amongst themselves, far more so when justice is to be done between\nthe Englishman and Chinese, the Bugguese and Hindoo, and the like. On the other hand, to apply the law of Europe direct, with all its accumulated processes and penalties, to a people of whom more than nine-tenths will probably be natives of China and the Malay Archipelago, would be as repugnant to universal and natural justice as it would be inconsistent with the benevolence and liberality which has ever marked the British rule in India.\n\nUnder these circumstances, nothing seems to be left but to have recourse to first principles, to use every precaution against the existence of temptation to crime that is found consistent with the perfect liberty of those who have no evil intentions, and when these precautions fail, to secure redress to the injured party, when possible, and such punishment as will be most likely to prevent a repetition of the crime, either by the party himself offending, or by those who may be inclined to follow his example. Nothing should be endured in the Settlement, however sanctioned by the local usage of particular tribes who resort to it, that has either a direct effect, or notoriously strong tendency to endanger the safety or liberty of person or the security of property, and in the same manner no want of what are considered legal formalities in any country should debar a person from having substantial justice rendered to him, so that legal and moral obligation may never be at variance.\n\nTaking this as the fundamental principle for the Laws of the Settlement, it may be presumed that no local Regulation would be enacted that the society if left to themselves would not desire to see carried into effect; no public institution or source of expense would exist of which the benefit was not obvious to the enlightened part at least, if not to the whole body of the community, who would therefore soon feel that the Government was not made to tyrannize over the people, but for their protection and happiness.\n\nUnder such a system of administration, it is not unreasonable to expect that every facility would be afforded by the mass of the population to the Executive in carrying the Laws into effect, for even the midnight robber and swindler have no\ndesire that their own persons or property should be liable to those evils which they inflict on the rest of the community, and will readily join in their suppression when other delinquents are the objects of the terrors of the Law.\n\nIn carrying such a system into effect, it ought to be fully understood and maintained on all occasions, that while individuals are allowed to protect themselves as far as possible against wrongs, the redress of wrongs cannot be left to the resentment or the revenge of the parties conceiving themselves injured. That must be done solely by Government through the instrumentality of the Judicial and Executive Officers whom it appoints for that purpose.\n\nNo one therefore being allowed to be a judge in his own case, or to revenge his own quarrel, arms or weapons capable of inflicting instant death as habitually worn by the Malays become unnecessary, and, by dispensing with them, the greatest temptation to and power of doing to others the greatest and irremediable wrong in depriving them of life is in a great measure removed. If a man takes another's horse or cow by robbery or theft or under a mistaken idea that he has a right to the property in question, redress can be afforded to him as soon as he is convicted of his crime or discovers his error, but if from revenge or under false impressions a man is suddenly excited to take the life of a fellow creature, it is in vain that he afterwards discovers that he was misled by passion or had been deceived by appearances. It often happens too in these countries that a man who considers himself aggrieved by a particular individual and finding himself in possession of a sharp weapon, attempts the life of every one he meets indiscriminately, and without having any wrong at their hands to complain of. It is impossible to see who may or may not be guilty of such acts of inhuman cruelty, and therefore all should agree to lay aside the use of the weapon that is commonly employed by persons who then transform themselves to wild beasts by giving way to brutal passion.\n\nOn the same principle, it has been found by experience that those who indulge frequently in gaming and cockfighting, are not only liable to engage in quarrels with those who\nhave won their money, but also that they are incited to acts of fraud and robbery in order to obtain the means of amusement or of attempting to retrieve their losses; it is therefore the duty of Government to suppress both gaming and cock-fighting as far as possible without trespassing on the free will of private conduct. No man should be allowed to receive any money either directly or indirectly for conducting a gaming table or cock-pit, and winners of money at such places should be compelled to restore the amount to the losers, and should on no account be permitted to enforce payment from those with whom they have gambled on credit.\n\nIntoxication being a source of personal danger to the community, and the indulgence in that vice being a frequent cause of betraying those who are addicted to it to the commission of acts of dishonesty, it is the duty of a good Magistracy to throw every obstacle in the way. In the first place the Officers of Police should be required to place in constraint any person seen in public in a state of intoxication until he becomes sober, and in the next place the vender of intoxicating articles who supplied him with the means of inebriety, should be visited with proof* and fined, and be liable to make good the amount of any loss which the person so intoxicated can prove he suffered during his inebriety from being unable to take care of himself; the extent of this fine must necessarily be discretionary on the part of the Magistrate, depending principally on the degree of inebriety produced; it should always be of such an amount that the fear of being subject to it may be sufficient to outweigh in the mind of the vender the temptation of profit in the sale of his goods; of course if it should appear in evidence that the individual was supplied with the means of intoxication for the purpose of taking advantage of him in that state, the object converts the simple misdemeanour into a crime according to the particular purpose contemplated, and further punishment to the guilty as well as redress to the individual injured must be awarded accordingly. The use of spirituous liquors, though innocent in moderation, becomes vicious when indulged in to\n\n* Sic, probably \"reproof.\"\nexcess; the consumption may be diminished by the enhancement of price, and in this way the indulgence may be made so expensive as to be only attainable beyond the bounds of moderation by those whose means give them a station in society that induces them to be guarded in their conduct for the sake of preserving the respect of those whose eyes are turned upon them; thus, while gaming as practised by the Chinese and cock-fighting by the Malays are absolutely pernicious in every degree in which they come under public cognizance, the use of opium and spirituous liquors may be repressed by exacting a heavy tax in the way of License from the venders.\n\nThere are many important considerations that stand in the way of enacting laws against prostitution, indeed it would, in a country where concubinage is not forbidden, be difficult to draw a line between the concubine and the common prostitute; it is practicable however in some degree, and highly desirable, that the temptation to profit should not exist to induce the seduction of women into this course of life by others of their own sex; the unfortunate prostitute should be treated with compassion, but every obstacle should be thrown in the way of her service being a source of profit to any one but herself. It should therefore be declared unlawful for any person whatever to share the hire or wages of prostitution or to derive any profit or emolument either directly or indirectly by maintaining or procuring prostitutes, as for any parent or guardian of a female or any other person to ask or receive directly or indirectly any reward for bestowing a female in prostitution, any custom, law or usage of the country in which such female or her parents or her guardians were born notwithstanding, reserving only for a jury to advise what constitutes a legal obligation on the man to support the woman thus bestowed, or in other words a contract of marriage by local usage and what a connection of prostitution; the penalty must here also be modified by circumstances. It is much more criminal to induct a girl into prostitution than to facilitate her pursuit of vice after she has entered upon it as a profession.\n\nIt may be necessary to make specific Regulations for the\nprotection of the community generally against fire, both with regard to the construction of buildings, the storing of gunpowder and combustibles, the manufacture of arrack, &c., &c., the power of infringing on a neighbour's property after a fire has broken out either for the purpose of access to the means of extinguishing it or to prevent its spreading to a greater distance.\n\nBoatmen and parties offering themselves publicly for hire may also be subjected to regulation with the view of facilitating the attainment of redress when they are guilty of fraud and negligence.\n\nWeights and measures of the acknowledged standard should be accessible to all, and those used in purchases and sales ought to be in strict conformity with such standards. Certain Magisterial Officers, therefore, should be employed to examine those used by persons who openly keep goods exposed for sale. When found defective the person in whose behoof they are used should be liable to fine proportioned to his supposed means and the apparent degree of fraud resorted to.\n\nFraud with respect to the quality of articles is a crime more readily detected, and may be left to private prosecution. In giving redress to the individual, punishment ought to be annexed in proportion as the fraud is of an injurious nature.\n\nAs a great check to fraud and falsehood, a general Registry Office for all written agreements or engagements which are liable to be made the ground of dispute before a Court of Justice, should be opened for the public. Regulation should be made for the authenticity of the document in the first instance, and either party or any party interested should be entitled to a copy, paying for the same a moderate fee as a compensation for the trouble given to the Registrar and his Establishment. Precaution must of course be taken against the falsification or abstraction of such documents from the Registrar's Office. All deeds which may be so registered should have an avowed preference over one that is not so registered, unless the holder of the latter can shew a clear, distinct and satisfactory cause why he has not been able to have his deed registered and the onus of establishing this ought decidedly to rest on him.\nNuisances generally speaking may be safely left to the complaint of individuals in each particular instance where the cause of nuisance is not obvious to all, or directly injurious to particular individuals, as crowding the river with vessels, &c., when it may be made subject of special regulation.\n\nAll house-holders should be registered and all houses numbered; auctioneers and pawnbrokers should be placed under specific regulations, and none allowed to act as such without giving security for complying with the same and taking out a license for the purpose.\n\nWith respect to the employment of informers, it may be observed that Magistrates must have information, but no bad passion should be elicited in the procuring of it. No temptation to lead others to vice for the sake of reward for informing, no inducement to betray confidence, and the act of giving information should be treated as a public and honourable duty.\n\nPrecautionary measures being taken on the above principles for preserving the peace and good order of society and removing as far as practicable the immediate temptations to crime and violence, it next becomes necessary to define what shall be considered Crimes, what lawful punishments and how injuries shall be redressed.\n\nBy the constitution of England, the absolute rights of the subject are defined as follows:\n\n1st. \"The right of personal security; which consists in a person's legal uninterrupted enjoyment of his life, his limbs, his body, his health and his reputation.\"\n\n2nd. \"The right of personal liberty; which consists in the power of locomotion, of changing situation or removing one's person to whatever place one's own inclination may direct, without imprisonment or restraint, unless by due course of Law.\"\n\n3rdly. \"The right of property; which consists in the use, enjoyment and disposal of all acquisitions without any control or diminution save only by the Laws of the Land.\"\n\nThere seems no reason for denying corresponding rights to all classes of people residing under the protection of the British Flag at Singapore, the Laws of the Land being such\nas are or may be enacted under the provisions of Regulation No. III of 1823, dated the 20th January last, with such others of a more general nature as may be directed by a higher Authority or which may necessarily accrue under the provisions of the Legislature and the political circumstances of the Settlement as a Dependence of Great Britain. Admitting these rights to exist, it follows that all acts by which they are invaded are wrongs, that is to say, crimes or injuries.\n\nIn the enactment of Laws for securing these rights, legal obligation must never supercede or take place of or be inconsistent with or more or less onerous than moral obligation. The English practice of teaching prisoners to plead not guilty, that they may thus have a chance of escaping from punishment, is inconsistent with this and consequently objectionable. It is indeed right and proper that the Court should inform itself of all the circumstances of a crime from witnesses as well as from the declaration of the prisoner himself. Denial is in fact an aggravation of a crime according to every idea of common sense. It disarms punishment of one of its most beneficial objects by casting a shade of doubt over its justice.\n\nThe sanctity of oaths should also be more upheld than in the English Courts. This may be done by never administering them except as a dernier resort. If they are not frequently administered, not only will their sanction be more regarded and in this way their breach be less proportionately frequent, but of necessity much more absolutely uncommon and consequently much more certainly visited with due punishment in all cases of evidence given before a Court of Justice.\n\nThe imprisonment of an unfortunate debtor at the pleasure of the creditor, by which the services of the individual are lost to all parties, seems objectionable in this Settlement, and it is considered that the rights of property may be sufficiently protected by giving to the creditor a right to the value of the debtor's services for a limited period in no case exceeding 5 years, and that the debtor should only be liable to imprisonment in case of fraud, and as far as may be necessary for the security of his person in the event of his not being able to find bail during the process of the Court and for the performance\nof the decree after judgment may be passed.\n\nIt is well known that the Malay race are sensibly alive to shame, and that in many instances they would prefer death to ignominy. That is a high and honourable feeling and ought to be cherished; let great care be taken to avoid all punishments which are unnecessarily degrading. Both the Malays and Chinese are a reasoning people, and though each may reason in a way peculiar to themselves and different in some respects from our own way of reasoning. This germ of civilization should not be checked. Let no man be punished without a reason assigned. Let the principles of British Law be applied not only with mildness but with a patriarchal kindness and indulgent consideration for the prejudices of each tribe as far as natural justice will allow, but also with reference to their reasoning powers however weak, and that moral principle which, however often disregarded, still exists in the consciences of all men. Let the native institutions as far as regards religious ceremonies, marriage and inheritance be respected when they may not be inconsistent with justice and humanity or injurious to the peace and morals of society.\n\nLet all men be considered equal in the eye of the Law.\n\nLet no man be banished the country without a trial by his peers or by due course of Law.\n\nLet no man be deprived of his liberty without a cause, and no man detained in confinement beyond 48 hours without a right to demand a hearing and trial according to due course of Law.\n\nLet the people have a voice through the Magistracy by which their sentiments may at all times be freely expressed.\n\nIn fixing a scale of punishments, the first principle to be attended to is that they should be so graduated as to attach to each particular crime its due and relative punishment according to its enormity, and with regard to the nature of the punishments they should be as mild and humane as the general security of person and property admits of. Severity of punishment defeats its own end, and the laws should in all cases be so mild that no one may be deterred from prosecuting a criminal by considerations of humanity. No feeling\ninterferes with justice in behalf of a murderer, let this crime be punished by death, and no other. Banishment is the next in order. Solitary confinement proportioned to the degree of the offence or pertinacity of the offender in his criminal course seems the least objectionable of all sorts of punishment. Disgrace may also be a form of punishment, but much caution is required in this respect lest a too frequent enforcement of the punishment destroy the feeling which can alone make it a punishment. Personal chastisement is only for the lower orders who are incapable of feeling the shame of disgrace and may probably be had recourse to in cases of wilful perjury where the falsehood of the witness is palpable and his object particularly mischievous. In all cases let it be considered as no less an object of the Law to afford redress to the party injured than to punish the offender. Compensation should in all cases, where it is possible, be made to the injured party to the extent of the means of the offender, as in the case of the Malay Bangoon where when the father is murdered the family are entitled to pecuniary compensation for his loss.\n\n(Signed) T. S. RAFFLES.\n\nWith these views and principles the Lieutenant-Governor has this day transmitted to the Acting Magistrates such a graduated Scale of Crimes and Punishments as appears to him sufficient to meet the existing circumstances of the Settlement and to answer the end of substantial justice, with instructions that they will duly deliberate on the subject and after such revision as their local knowledge and experience may suggest, submit the same to the Chief Local Authority with their opinion, and in the form of a Code of Laws to be established for the Settlement and to be in force after publication by the Resident until rescinded by a higher Authority, or altered under the provisions laid down for the enactment of local Laws and Regulations.\nThe Magistrates have further been required to frame in the form of a Police Regulation, to be approved and published by Government, such further Regulations as may be advisable in that Department.\n\nIt is to be hoped that the provisions that will be thus made will be found sufficient for the public peace and the protection of person and property until circumstances may admit of the establishment of a more regular Court of Judicature, every arrangement that can be now made being necessarily of a provisional nature.\n\nDated at Singapore this day of June, 1823.\n\n(Signed) T.

RAFFLES.\nSOME NOTES ON THE SAKAI DIALECTS\nOF THE\nMALAY PENINSULA.\nBY\nHUGH CLIFFORD.\n\n\"For the purpose of disclosing to us the real character of language left to itself to follow its own laws, without let or hindrance, a study of Chinese and the Turanian dialects, a study even of the jargons of the savages of Africa, Polynesia and Melanesia is far more instructive than the most minute analysis of Sanskrit or Hebrew.\"\n\n\"On the Stratification of Languages.\"\u2014Max M\u00fcller.\n\nThe present paper deals with some of the jargons referred to by Professor Max M\u00fcller in the extract from the lecture above quoted, and as the dialects spoken by the largest Sakai tribes of the Peninsula have hitherto practically escaped observation, I trust that even the scanty data in my possession may prove of interest to the readers of this Journal. I do not propose to publish at the present time an exhaustive vocabulary of any of the dialects in question, as the material in my possession is not, in my opinion, sufficiently complete to render any publication that I could now make, of permanent value. I venture to think, however, that as during the last seven years I have visited many aboriginal tribes, and have collected vocabularies of their dialects in several parts of the Peninsula, many of the facts which I have ascertained, and the conclusions to which, in my opinion, these facts point, may be new and worthy of consideration by those who care for philological study. At some future date, when I have had further\nopportunities of perfecting and completing my grammar and vocabularies of Sakai dialects, I hope to be able to publish them in a form which will be more thorough and satisfactory than any which I could now attempt, and I shall, therefore, restrict myself in the present paper to a few notes on these dialects, and their connection with Malay.\n\nIn the same way, and for the same reasons, I shall not attempt to embody in this article any facts concerning the Semang or Pangan, as the Negritos proper are variously called by the Malays, and even in the Sakai dialects, I shall deal chiefly with the S\u00e9n-oi dialect, which is that with which I have the more intimate acquaintance, and which appears to be the purest form of Sakai extant.\n\nBefore going any further, however, it is necessary to clearly state that the aborigines of the Peninsula consist of people of two distinct races. The first, or Sakai, are a light-coloured, slenderly built people with the wavy, abundant hair, and in many cases the drooping nose of the Polynesian. The second, or Semang, who are true Negrito, are short, dark and thickset, with woolly hair, flat features, thick lips and general Negro characteristics. The former have attained a degree of civilization which is far superior to anything which the Negrito have reached. Sakai live in houses, and plant as well as hunt. The Negrito lives by his bow and blow-pipe alone, and lives in a temporary lean-to shed in spots where game is most plentiful. The Sakai affects to look down upon the Negrito, while the latter is a happy-go-lucky, cheery, little hunter who looks down on nobody.\n\nThe Sakai tribe is now split up into innumerable clans, each consisting of a few families, living in places surrounded by the Malays, and thus cut off from intercommunication with one another. These small clans, as might be anticipated, show many signs of the influence exerted over them by their Malay neighbours in their language and customs, and though it is comparatively rare to find them embracing the Muhammadan faith, still their civilization is more advanced, and they themselves are more degenerate than their brothers the Sakai of the far interior. There is a clan of Sakai in Kuantan (Pahang)\nwhich actually keeps a Malay Pendekar to teach the young idea the art of Malay fencing! This is an exceptional case, but, as a rule, when a Sakai has come to wear clothes he is morally a ruined man.\n\nAmong these clans the dialect spoken is so interspersed with Malay words and phrases, as to be merely a bastard form of the original tongue, and it is not from them that we can learn what the pure Sakai language is. A study of such mutilated dialects, except as a means of watching the rapid decadence of a barbarous tongue, would not repay the labour. Fortunately there is one large district in the Peninsula which is still purely Sakai country, the only permanent inhabitants being all of the Sakai race. This district is situated in almost the exact centre of the Peninsula, and comprises the head waters of the Jelai, Telom, and Serau Rivers in Pahang, the ulu of the Batang Padang, Bidor, Kampar, and Plus Rivers in Perak, and of the Galas and Nenggiri Rivers in Kelantan. This large tract of country having from time immemorial been almost exclusively peopled by Sakai, it is here alone that the pure Sakai is met with, and then only in the interior of the district, in places where the Malay language is still unknown. Here we find the Sakai tongue spoken as it has been spoken for generations, and containing comparatively few Malay words, or signs of the influence of the Malay language. Outside influence, as is well known, is a great modifier of all languages, and more especially of the dialects of a wholly unlettered people, and it is, therefore, a matter of some interest to find the Sakai in those places where such influence has scarcely had an opportunity of being brought to bear upon him, or where such disturbing elements have been reduced to an absolute minimum. Comparison with the dialects spoken by the scattered tribes, who have long been surrounded by Malays, shews that in the pure Sakai dialects many words are found which have been replaced by Malay words among the former tribes, and that the general purity of the language has been much destroyed by the introduction of foreign words or phrases.\n\nFor these reasons, I shall deal chiefly with the two\ndialects of Sakai spoken in the tract of jungle, or \"Sakai country\" above referred to, and shall only use the vocabularies collected in other parts of the Peninsula for purposes of comparison and illustration.\n\nThe two dialects here mentioned are called by the Sakai of the lower half of this district \"S\u0115n-oi\" and \"T\u0115m-be\u2019\", respectively, though the term \"S\u0115n-oi\" is applied to itself by each of the tribes in question, neither of which will allow that the other has any right to the appellation. The term \"Gob\" (a stranger) is applied to all mankind other than the hill-tribesmen, the term \"Gob M\u0103l\u0101yu\" being used for the Malays, \"Gob Ch\u00ee-na\u2019\" for a Chinaman, and \"Gob B\u00ee-\u00fbg\" (the white stranger) for a European. A line drawn from Blanja on the Perak River to the Bidor mountains, and thence to Kuala Nenggiri in the State of Kelantan, will roughly divide these two tribes from one another, the country South of this line being inhabited by S\u0115n-oi, and the northern division by T\u0115m-be\u2019. Trade and other intercourse is carried on between the T\u0115m-be\u2019 and S\u0115n-oi, but though the dialects spoken are, in my opinion, undoubtedly mere variations one of another, still they differ sufficiently to render it impossible for a S\u0115n-oi to understand a T\u0115m-be\u2019 and vice versa, unless either is familiar with the dialect of the other.\n\nThe grounds on which I base my statement as to the near connection between these dialects, and their intimate relation with one another, are the curiously close resemblance which exists between many of the more elementary words in both S\u0115n-oi and T\u0115m-be'. The following examples, taken almost hap-hazard from my Sakai vocabularies, will amply illustrate the above fact, and, in my opinion, are sufficient to justify the belief that both tongues are sprung from the same source, even if one is not a mere corruption of the other:\n\n| English   | S\u0115n-oi | T\u0115m-be\u2019 |\n|-----------|--------|---------|\n| To eat    | Cha\u2019   | Cha\u2019    |\n| To go     | Chip   | Chip    |\n| To give   | \u00d4k     | \u00d4k      |\n| To take   | Kod    | Kod     |\n| To laugh  | L\u00fbk    | L\u00fbp     |\n### English\n\n| English                  | S\u011bn-oi     | T\u011bm-be'   |\n|--------------------------|------------|-----------|\n| Cooked rice              | Cha\u2019-na\u2019   | Cha\u2019-na\u2019   |\n| To be; to have, &c.      | M\u016dng       | Moh       |\n| Fire                     | Ois        | Ois       |\n| A bird                   | Ch\u0113p       | Ch\u0113p      |\n| Earth-hand               | T\u00ea         | T\u00ea        |\n| A husband                | \u0112n-s\u00eer     | S\u00eer       |\n| Down stream              | R\u00eah        | R\u00eah       |\n| A path                   | Nong       | Nong      |\n| The head                 | K\u00fb-i       | K\u00fb-i      |\n| The stomach              | Kut        | Kut       |\n| Jungle                   | S\u011b-r\u00e2k\u207f    | S\u011b-rok    |\n| High                     | Ch\u011b-r\u016dk\u207f   | J\u011b-r\u014fk    |\n| Tired; fatigued          | G\u011b-h\u00eal     | G\u011b-h\u00eal    |\n| To; towards, &c.         | Ma\u2019        | Ma\u2019       |\n\nThe above examples can easily be multiplied, but they are, in my opinion, sufficient to establish the intimate connection which exists between the S\u011bn-oi and T\u011bm-be\u2019 dialects: nevertheless it must not be supposed that all or even the majority of the words used by these two clans are equally similar to one another. The following specimens of common and elementary words will amply prove that this is not the case, although even in some of them I maintain that a near connection can also be traced:\n\n### English\n\n| English                  | S\u011bn-oi     | T\u011bm-be'   |\n|--------------------------|------------|-----------|\n| I, me, we, us            | Eng        | Y\u0113h       |\n| You, he, she, it         | H\u0113h        | H\u0101h       |\n| Come                     | Da         | B\u0113        |\n| To do; to make           | \u016a-i        | \u0112l        |\n| Smoke                    | Bi-ch\u00fbl    | J\u0113t-j\u014ft   |\n| A lie                    | Pa\u2019-ho\u2019    | Li-bus    |\n| A tiger                  | Rak\u207f       | Ma\u2019-nu    |\n| Flooring                 | Ching-karr | N\u012bs       |\n| A pillow                 | T\u011b-n\u00fb-i    | Ch\u0113ng-kol |\n| A mother                 | M\u0113         | Boh       |\n| A father                 | B\u00ee         | B\u0115r       |\n| A child                  | K\u0115-nod     | Kwod      |\n| A blow-pipe              | B\u0115-lau     | Bl\u00e2-h\u00fb    |\nEnglish.  \nTo hear  \nA house  \nGood; pretty  \nHere  \nGreat; large  \n\nS\u0113n-oi  \nG\u0113r-t\u0113k  \nD\u0113rk\u207f  \nBor  \nDih  \n\u0112n-toi  \n\nT\u0113m-be'  \nK\u0113-yok  \nD\u0113h  \nM\u0113ng  \nDoh  \nM\u0113-n\u00fb\n\nThe numerals, which are a curious feature in Sakai dialects, also differ in S\u0113n-oi and T\u0113m-be'. No Sakai can count, in his own dialect, above three, and among the pure Sakai tribes of the interior no words are in use to express four, five, etc., a word which means \"many, etc.\" being used for any number greater than three. The Sakai who are met with near Malay settlements have, for the most part, adopted the Malay numerals up to ten, but this is merely another instance of the influence which the Malays have exerted on the manner of thought, and consequently on the language of these savages. The numerals as known to the pure Sakai are as follows:\n\nEnglish.  \nOne  \nTwo  \nThree  \nMany, etc.\n\nS\u0113n-oi.  \nNa\u2019-nu  \nNar  \nN\u0113  \nK\u0113rp\u207f\n\nT\u0113m-be'.  \nN\u0113h  \nNar  \nNe\u2019  \nCha\u2019-tuk\u207f\n\nIn only one case have I encountered a higher numeral than three among any of the aboriginal dialects of the Peninsula. The tribe in whose vocabulary a word for the numeral \"four\" was found lived, in 1885, in the jungles near Sadang on the geographical right bank of the Perak River, and consisted at that time of only seven members. I was told by the father of this family that he, his wife and his children were all who survived of a comparatively large clan, which, I make little doubt, will shortly be wholly extinct. Professor Max M\u00fcller tells of a traveller in South America who saw a parrot which was the only living creature that could speak some words of a forgotten tongue. A vocabulary which I compiled of this dialect will act the part of the parrot, and will shortly be the only record that such a dialect was ever spoken by man. This tribe called itself Semang as opposed to the Sakai tribes of\nLengkugas near Blanja, but its representatives differed very considerably in physical characteristics from the Semang of Ulu Perak, and the Pangan of Ulu Kelantan and Ulu Pahang. The following are the numerals in use among these Semang:\n\n| English | Semang of Sadang |\n|---------|------------------|\n| One     | Nai              |\n| Two     | B\u00eah              |\n| Three   | Pat              |\n| Four    | Sa-b\u00eah           |\n\nIn other respects, however, this dialect was even more primitive than any Sakai language with which I am acquainted, no word being used for \"male,\" \"female\" and many other elementary expressions.\n\nAs I trust that I have now been able to establish the near connection between the Sen-oi and Tem-be' dialects, I propose, in the following table, to give examples of twenty words found in four Sakai dialects collected in Perak and Pahang, which will, in my opinion, support my contention that the isolated or the scattered Sakai clans all speak languages which have a common origin, and which are closely connected one with another. Of the Sakai of the sea-coast, if indeed these people are really Sakai, and not some other race, I do not profess to treat, as I have had few opportunities of gaining any sufficient knowledge concerning them. The Sakai who speak the dialects, to which the table printed below refers, are all hill-tribes, or land Sakai, and all present the same physical characteristics which I have described in an earlier paragraph of this paper:\n\n| English | Sen-oi | Tem-be' | Blanja dialect | Slim dialect |\n|---------|--------|---------|----------------|--------------|\n| 1 To sit | G\u00fb-i   | G\u00fbl     | G\u00fb-i           | G\u00ear-i        |\n| 2 That  | J\u00eeh    | Nah     | J\u00eeh            | J\u00eeh          |\n| 3 Recently; just | Pai | Pai     | Pai            | Pai          |\n| 4 To throw away | W\u00eah | Gas     | Gas            | Gas          |\n| 5 A pig | Gau    | Gaur    | Gau            | Gau          |\n| 6 To bring | \u00can | \u00can      | \u00can             | An           |\n| 7 A rhinoceros | \u00c2-gap | \u00c2-gap   | \u00c2-gap          | S\u00eb-j\u00e2p       |\n| English       | S\u0113n-oi   | T\u0113m-be\u2019 | Blanja dialect | Slim dialect |\n|--------------|---------|---------|----------------|--------------|\n| 8 A dog      | Cho\u2019    | Ch\u00fb-or  | Cho\u2019           | Cho\u2019         |\n| 9 A cloud; the sky | R\u00e2-hu | R\u00e2-hu  | S\u00fb-i           | R\u00e2-hu        |\n| 10 To sleep  | B\u00eat     | S\u0115-log  | B\u00eat            | B\u00eat          |\n| 11 Clothes   | \u00c2-bat   | \u00c2-bat\u207f  | \u00c2-bat          | \u00c2-bau        |\n| 12 A wife    | K\u0115-nah  | K\u0115-nah  | K\u0115-nah         | K\u0115-nah       |\n| 13 Water     | T\u00ea-u    | Org     | T\u00ea-u           | T\u00ea-u         |\n| 14 A river   | T\u00ea-u    | T\u00ea-u    | T\u00ea-u           | T\u00ea-u         |\n| 15 Wood      | J\u0115-hu   | J\u0115-hu   | J\u0115-hu          | J\u0115-hu        |\n| 16 A fowl    | Puk     | Ma\u2019-nuk | Puk            | Puk          |\n| 17 The moon  | G\u0115-che\u2019 | G\u0115-che\u2019 | G\u0115-che\u2019        | Bi-che\u2019      |\n| 18 To see    | Neng    | Neh     | Neng           | Nen          |\n| 19 To fly    | Gi      | Guh     | Gi             | Gi           |\n| 20 Female    | Kr\u0115-dol | Ba'-bo\u2019 | Kr\u0115-dol        | Kr\u0115-dol      |\n\nThe above examples will suffice for the purposes of illustration, and I may add that every dialect with which I have yet come in contact shews an equal resemblance to one or other of the two principal variations of the Sakai language\u2014the S\u0113n-oi and T\u0113m-be\u2019 dialects. Leaving the question of the connection which I maintain exists between the various Sakai dialects and sub-dialects, I shall now turn to an examination of some of the characteristics of the S\u0113n-oi language, which I have selected as being the form of Sakai with which I have the more intimate acquaintance.\n\nThis dialect is spoken by about 6,000 people who, as already stated, inhabit the lower portion of the Sakai country, and many of the isolated clans speak dialects which are merely modifications of it. In its grammar, and in its range of sound, it is merely a type of all Sakai dialects, and the vowels and consonants necessary to transliterate it are common to all these jargons.\n\nA fact which strikes the observer as curious in the Sakai dialects is that in so primitive a tongue so vast a variety of sounds should be found. In S\u0113n-oi there are the vowels \\(a\\), \\(e\\), \\(i\\), \\(o\\) and \\(u\\), each of which has four variations, viz., medium, long (\\(^{^}\\)), short (\\(^\\)), and abrupt (\\(\u2019\\)), with the exception of \\(u\\) which has no abrupt tone.\na is pronounced like the vowel sound in calm, ex., Da=to come.\n\n\u0101 is pronounced like the vowel sound in blast, ex., A-gap=a rhinoceros.\n\n\u0103 very short a sound, ex., Am-cha'=to eat; D\u0103k=to bear, to support.\n\na' similar to sound of the final ak in the Malay word Banyak in the dialects in which the k is silent, ex., Pa'-ho'=to lie; Ma'=to, towards.\n\ne as in the English word get, ex., Jel-jol=to hang.\n\n\u00e9 as in the French word est, ex., J\u00eak=an axe; N\u00ea=three.\n\n\u0113 a very short e sound, ex., R\u0113n-tak=the tongue; M\u0113-nang=a younger brother or sister.\n\ne' similar to the e sound in the Malay word Chapek, the k being silent, ex., Nya'-ne'=a ghost, a spirit.\n\ni as in the English word hit, ex., K\u0113-mit=a mosquito.\n\ni similar to the vowel sound in cheat, ex., Ku-i=language, speech; \u012a-ok\u207f=to fall.\n\n\u012b a very short i sound, shorter than in the English word hit, ex., B\u012b-lut=to extinguish; B\u012b-jog=wet.\n\ni' as in the Malay word badik, the k being silent, ex., Si'=to fell.\n\no as in ox, ex., Sok=hair.\n\n\u014d as in broken, ex., Sh\u014dk=the navel; \u014ck=to give.\n\n\u014f shorter than the o in ox, ex., D\u0115ng-d\u014fk\u207f=a branch.\n\no' similar to the final ok in puchok, the k being silent, ex., Da'-do'=sufficient, enough.\n\nu similar to the vowel sound in moon, ex., Nyun=near; Ku-rul=the knee.\n\n\u016b similar to the u sound in acute, ex., K\u00fb-ish=a porcupine; D\u00fbl=the handle of a weapon.\n\n\u016d rather shorter than the u sound in hug, ex., Kr\u0115-r\u016dg=to pull or pluck out.\nIn addition to the above vowel sounds, there are the semi-\nvowels \\( w \\) and \\( y \\), pronounced as in English, ex., W\u00eak=to\nshoot with a bow; Wihih=do not!, desist!; Yatn=a grand-\nfather; Yap=to speak.\n\nThere are also the diphthongs ai, pronounced eye, ex.,\nPai=recently, just, only just; Laish=an ant.\n\nau pronounced like the vowel sound in how, ex., P\u00eb-lau-\ni=a star; B\u00eb-lau=a blow-pipe.\n\noi pronounced like the vowel sound in boy, ex., S\u00ebn-oi=\na man; Ch\u00eb-noi=a post.\n\nThe consonants are as follows, and are similar to those in\nEnglish, in so far as their value is concerned:\n\n\\( b, ch, d, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, \\) and \\( z \\).\n\nThese consonants combine as follows:\n\nng similar to the Malay \\( \\xi \\), ex., Ng\u00ebn-tap=the testicles;\nM\u00ebng=the cheeks.\n\nny similar to the Malay \\( \\psi \\), or the Spanish \\( \\tilde{n} \\), ex., Ny\u00fbh=\nheavy; Nyun=near.\n\nsh, which is equivalent to the Malay \\( \\chi \\), ex., K\u00eb-l\u00ebsh=a\nmountain; J\u00eesh=daylight; Sh\u00f4k=the navel.\n\nThere are two distinct r\u2019s in S\u00ebn-oi\u2014one, which is gut-\ntural, pronounced very deep down in the throat, I have ren-\ndered \\( r \\), ex., R\u00e2-hu=the sky, the heavens; R\u00e9j-\u00e4-roj=\nlost, to lose one\u2019s way: and the other, which I have rendered\nrr, is a rolled r more pronounced than the rolled r in French.\n\nAnother peculiarity of S\u00ebn-oi is the existence of what, for\nwant of a better name, I have termed \u201cnasal finals.\u201d These\nare final \\( kn \\), final \\( pn \\), and final \\( tn \\). They are pronounced by\nclosing the lips and emitting a very slight nasal \\( n \\) sound in a\ndescending tone after the final \\( k, p \\) or \\( t \\) has been articulated.\nA similar sound is found, I believe, in the Hottentot dialects,\nbut I have as yet had no opportunity of comparing Sakai with\nthe African tongues.\n\nEvery syllable in Sakai is pronounced separately and dis-\ntinctly, with a kind of catch between each, and when Malay\nwords are adopted into the dialect, they too are always split\nup into their component syllables.\nThe grammar of the language appears to be simple. The following are the principal rules:\n\nI.\u2014The nominative precedes the verb it governs.\n\nII.\u2014The accusative follows the verb which governs it.\n\nIII.\u2014Adjectives and demonstrative pronouns follow the noun they qualify.\n\nIV.\u2014The cases are formed by the use of prepositions, with the exception of the genitive case, which is formed by placing the possessor immediately after the thing possessed. The idea at, to, towards is rendered by the preposition Ma\u2019. The idea on and from by the preposition K\u0113n. These prepositions (with the additional particle P\u0101=ai, ow) are found to exist in the same or in slightly modified forms in all the dialects of Sakai with which I am acquainted.\n\nV.\u2014There are no inflections of nouns or conjugation of verbs, but the cases are indicated by the personal pronouns, and the words and tenses by means of the auxiliaries H\u00f4t\u2014to wish, to want, and T\u0113-l\u0101s\u2014to be done, over, done, finished, enough.\n\nThe following sentences will illustrate all the above rules:\n\n(i) Eng cha\u2019 cha\u2019-na\u2019.\n\n1 2 3\n\nI eat rice.\n\n(ii) H\u0113h t\u0113-l\u0101s kuh ka\u2019 j\u012bh.\n\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nHe has killed that fish.\n\n(iii) Derkn \u00eang b\u0113 ma\u2019-chut.\n\n1 2 3 4\n\nMy house [is] very small.\n\n(iv) \u014ck i-\u00f4dz \u00eang ma\u2019 h\u0113.\n\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nGive my chopper to him.\n(v) H\u00ea chip ma' lor.\nWhere [are] you going (Lit., You go to where?).\n\n(vi) \u00cang h\u00f4t chip ma' ta'.\nI [am] going upstream (Lit., I wish to go to the interior).\n\n(vii) H\u00ea g\u00fb-i k\u0115n t\u00ea nyun derk\u207f j\u00eeh.\nSit you upon the ground near this house.\n\n(viii) \u00cang pai h\u00f4l k\u0115n r\u00ea.\nI [have] just arrived from downstream.\n\n(ix) Ia-lok m\u0115-nang \u00eang h\u00f4t chip ma' s\u0115-rak\u207f bort ch\u00eap.\nTo-morrow [my] brother will go to [the]*jungle [to]\ncatch birds.\n\n(x) Bi-ch\u00fbl \u00e2-bat\u207f s\u0115n-oi.\nSmoke [is] the garment [of the] Sakai. (a S\u0115n-oi proverb).\n\nThe above will, I hope, give a sufficiently clear idea of the manner in which S\u0115n-oi sentences are formed, but before passing on to other matters, there are one or two peculiarities of the S\u0115n-oi dialect which I should like to mention. One is the extraordinarily close resemblance which exists between many words in this dialect, and which, at first, is very puzzling to one who has to compile his own grammar and vocabulary of these aboriginal tongues. The following examples will\nillustrate this peculiarity with sufficient clearness:\n\nCho' = A dog\nChoh = To void\nCh\u00f4k = To stab\nCh\u00f4kn = A root, a rattan\nDol = To place, to set down\nD\u00fbl = The handle of a knife\n\u00cang = I, we\n\u00can = To bring\nHol = A small black ape\u2014the siamang of the Malays\nH\u00f4l = To arrive\nKa' = A fish\nKah = To cut, to gash\nKol = Pith\nK\u00f4l = To fall down\nK\u00fb-i = The head\nKu-i = Language, speech\n\nThe colours which have names in the Sakai language are as follows:\n\nR\u00eb-ngah = Black\nBi-\u00fbg = White\nCh\u00ebng-ul = Red\n\nAll dark colours are included under \"Black;\" green, blue, mauve, &c. under \"White;\" and crimson, orange, yellow and brown under \"Red.\"\n\nHitherto all efforts to connect the S\u00ebn-oi dialects with any other tongue have failed, so far as my attempts are concerned, but I have now arranged to procure some further vocabularies for purposes of comparison, and hope to be able to discover a connection either with the Papuan dialects or with some of the jargons spoken by the Dyaks or other aboriginal tribes of the Malay Archipelago. The statement made by Mr. Vaughan Stevens that the Sakai dialects were closely connected with the language of Thibet is totally incorrect. After a careful comparison of the grammars and vocabularies of the two tongues, I am in a position to state that they have neither a root nor a grammatical form in common. Thibetan is a polysyllabic language with an elaborate grammar,\nwhich in no point is similar with anything found in Sakai or Semang. The language spoken by the latter people I hope to be able to connect with the inhabitants of the Andaman Islands. The physical characteristics of the two people are strikingly similar, and a comparison of their dialects will be full of interest. It would be somewhat premature, however, to do more than study the Sakai dialects themselves, and, as already stated, I have not hitherto succeeded in finding a single root in common in any of the vocabularies (including that of the Veddahs of Ceylon, which would appear to be a bastard Indian dialect) which I have as yet been able to examine.\n\nThere is yet another point on which I should wish to touch before concluding these notes. I refer to the connection between Sakai and Malay. In the introduction to his Malay Manual, Mr. W. E. Maxwell has propounded a theory to the effect that some Malay roots may possibly be derived from Sakai. He says:\u2014\u201cAnother characteristic list of words might be made compounded with the monosyllable Tang (which in Sakai and Semang means \u2018hand\u2019), and conveying an idea of seizing or holding. Tang-an\u2014the hand; Tang-kap\u2014to \u201cseize,\u201d &c., &c.\n\nNow, in S\u00ean-oi the word for \u201chand\u201d is Terk and in Tembe\u2019 it is Pi\u00eah. Semang dialects are absolutely distinct from Sakai, having but few roots in common, and in no dialect that I know does the word Tang occur meaning a \u201chand.\u201d This being so, I should be disinclined to accept Mr. Maxwell\u2019s theory, the more so as there is much evidence to prove that at the time the Malays first penetrated into the Peninsula and other Malay countries, they spoke a language which, both in its words and in the rules by which its substantives were formed, did not differ appreciably from the Malay of to-day.\n\nThe names duri-an, the thorny fruit, rambut-an, the hairy fruit, and pulas-an, the twisted fruit, were all given to the fruits in question (which are indigenous in the Malay countries alone) by a people in whose language the words duri, a thorn, rambut, hair, and pulas, to twist, were all accepted terms, and at a period when the inseparable affix an had come to be employed for the formation of substantives as it is to the\npresent day. The language being thus formed when the Malays first arrived in the Peninsula would preclude the possibility of the Malay language deriving elementary roots from Sakai dialects. Among the Sakai tribes, too, *sem-pa,* a durian, has no connection with *t\u0113r-l\u0101k*\u207f, a thorn, and the names for the other fruits are equally distinct, and seeing that even to the present day the durian groves of the far interior are one of the principal factors in the Sakai\u2019s annual food supply, it is only to be expected that the name of so important an article of food should be one of the first elementary words to be embodied in the language of a primitive people dwelling in the Malay Peninsula.\n\nBut the evidence leads us further yet. Most people who have travelled in the interior of the Peninsula have seen the stone implements which are frequently discovered by the natives. These implements, called *batu halilintar* or thunder bolts, by the Malays, who believe them to be the bolts hurled from the heavens during storms, are of three kinds\u2014stone axes, shaped somewhat like the Malay *bliong*; spearheads; and choppers. At the present day similar tools wrought in metal are sold to the Sakai by the Malays, but it is a significant fact that they are all called by Sakai names by the aborigines. The following are the names in question:\n\n| English   | Malay    | S\u0113n-oi   | T\u0113m-be' |\n|-----------|----------|----------|---------|\n| Axe       | Bliong   | J\u0113k      | J\u0113k     |\n| Spear     | Lembing  | Ta-rok   | B\u0113-lush |\n| Chopper   | Parang   | I-\u00f4dz    | I-\u00f4dz   |\n\nNow, in spite of Voltaire's famous saying that \"pour Messieurs les \u00e9tymologistes les consonnes ne lui co\u00fbtent rien et les voyelles bien peu de chose,\" I doubt whether any one will maintain that any connection exists between the Malay and aboriginal words for these implements. But the Malays also sell hatchets (*kapak*) to the Sakai, and this implement, which has no equivalent among the stone implements of the Peninsula, is called by the Malay name, *ku'-pak* being the Sakai modified form. Now these facts, I contend, point to the conclusion that at one time the tools made of stone were\nused by the Sakai and bore the names which are now given to the metal tools, of a similar shape, introduced by the Malays. That the metal weapons were introduced by a foreign race is proved by the fact that even to this day the pure Sakai have no knowledge of the art of fusing metals. That the Malays were the race which introduced these metal tools to the Sakai is rendered more probable by the fact that the weapons for which equivalents do not occur among the stone implements bear Malay names as already stated. If this point is allowed, there remains no alternative but to accept, what in my opinion is an undoubted fact, viz., that the Malays invaded the Peninsula at a period when they had attained to a considerable degree of knowledge in the useful arts, and their language formed in its essential characteristics, and that, therefore, the Malay language does not, and could not possibly, owe anything (saving perhaps the names of a few plants and beasts) to Sakai roots.\n\nIn the above remarks I have had occasion to state that the word Kapak, a hatchet, is adopted by the Sakai and becomes Ka'-pak as pronounced by the aborigines. Now this needs a word of comment, as it has frequently been remarked with surprise that the Sakai in adopting Malay words ending with k, which letter is silent in the dialects of the Peninsula, always give the silent k its full written value. Among other edifying deductions which have been drawn from this simple fact, it has been gravely argued that the peculiarity has arisen from the fact that the Malays of the Peninsula at some former period spoke as do their neighbours of Borneo and Sumatra, who pronounce all final k's. That the Sakai learned it at that period, and have never abandoned the practice, though why they should have retained a peculiarity of pronunciation which the Malays of the Peninsula have relinquished, was not explained.\n\nNow, the true explanation of this matter really is that in Sakai there are certain phonetic laws, of which the Sakai themselves are unconscious, but which, so far as I yet know, are employed without exception in all cases where Malay words are adopted into S\u0113n-oi. These rules can be stated,\nbut not explained, any more than it can be told why in Malay words with an initial s form the verb by dropping that letter and substituting meny. In both Sakai and Malay it is probable that euphony to the native ear is alone responsible for such rules. In Sakai the following are the phonetic changes which words adopted by the aborigines from Malay undergo, according to the original termination of the Malay word:\n\n(I) All Malay words split up into component syllables.\n\n(II) A final vowel becomes that vowel in its abrupt (') form. Thus, luka, a wound, becomes S\u0113n-oi lu-ka'.\n\n(III) Final m becomes final nasal p\". The vowel in the last syllable sometimes changing from a to u. Thus, jeram, a rapid, becomes j\u0113-rup\".\n\n(IV) Final ng becomes final nasal k\". Thus, kuching, a cat, becomes ku-chik\"; cherang, a clearing, becomes ch\u0113-rak\".\n\n(V) Final ak, ek, ik, ok and uk in Malay, though silent in that language, are pronounced as they are written and not as they are pronounced by the Malays of the Peninsula.\n\nThe reason for rule (V) is apparent. The Malay sound of the finals written ak, ek, ik, ok and uk are already in use by the Sakai for another class of words adopted from the Malay, as will be seen by rule (II) above. As stated in rule (IV), k\", the only other appropriate sound, is employed for words adopted from the Malay ending in ng. The only resource left to the Sakai is, therefore, to pronounce the k in order to distinguish between the final a, e, i, o or u, and the final ak, ek, ik, ok and uk, and this is accordingly done.\n\nI have now written all that I think it advisable to publish at the present time, and finally I will briefly recapitulate the conclusions which, I think, are shewn to be probable, if not certain, from the evidence which I have submitted. Firstly, then, I hold that the Sakai all speak various dialects of a common tongue; secondly, that they are more ancient inhabitants of the Peninsula than are the Malays; and lastly, that the former have not derived any elementary roots from the Sakai.\n\n15th September, 1891.\nULLY a century ago much of the traffic between Siam and the West passed over the Malay Peninsula between Mergui and Koh Lak, and in the month of June of this year, having occasion to visit Mergui, I chose this old route. In those olden days carriages with ladies riding in them and driven by cockaded coachmen were wont to pass to and fro by this route, but the remains of the old road that can be seen to-day lead one to suspect that such a statement was the gloss some old writer put upon the rustic, squeaking bullock-carts with their native drivers that wore their hair cut in a shoe-brush fashion by way of a cockade. In those days Tenasserim stood at the terminus on the Burmese side, then the capital of a kingdom and often spoken of as a Venice of the East, for she possessed a large fleet of vessels that carried her commerce all over the Bay of Bengal, while at the Siamese terminus, Koh Lak sheltered many junks and big boats that carried the overland traffic to Ayuthia or to Bangkok and further if necessary. But the rapid transit brought about by steam has killed this trade, Tenasserim is little better than a memory, a white man is a rare sight in Koh Lak, and the jungle has seized and made much of the road its own again.\nKoh Lak itself is a small island rising from the sea like a rudely splintered church tower, but on the adjacent mainland is a small town bearing the same name. Along the sea-board here, are numerous small patches of paddy fields with rude bamboo houses, raised high above the ground, scattered amongst them, and numerous water-buffaloes feeding in the deserted clearings. Looking westwards, some ten miles distant, one can see Khow Maun (known on the Burmese side as Khow Mordaun) rising from the ridge that divides Siam from Burma, over the shoulder of which the path we were to take turned. It was then the 7th of June, and the South-West Monsoon had set in, and although upon the East side of the Peninsula not a drop of rain was falling, we could see heavy masses of vapour lying upon the West side of the hills, and evidently rain falling plentifully on there.\n\nMy guide, who had been known to me for over two years as a miner and hunter at Bangtaphan, was a Siamese with a dash of Burmese blood in him and had relations living on both sides of the Peninsula whom he visited frequently, and known to those of the Siamese side as Nai Yeet, to those in Burma as Moung See. He would assent gravely to the most improbable statements, and the real state of matters never stood a moment in his way from putting them as he thought they were wanted to be. He had announced this road as eminently suited for elephants, and that a pony might go along, so that I was tempted to travel at ease. Luckily I had with me another man, Nuan by name, a most faithful Siamese and quite an ornament to the skin he wears.\n\nHaving followed the coast line from Bangtaphan northwards to Koh Lak, we there turned inland and made for the pass across the hills at Khow Maun. For the first four miles, a rough dray-path led us over a shallow, level, damp soil carrying a stunted jungle clear overhead, so that we made a swinging pace. But at the end of the four miles the path ended in a clearing in the jungle covered with tall lalang grass and full of shallow pools, and for the following five miles we followed an irregular footpath that wound through the jungle. The soil was here deeper and drier, and the trees grew larger and\noffered great obstruction to our passage. Before entering this footpath we noticed by the wayside a small clearing covered with green grass and where probably had stood a rest-house for travellers. After leaving the houses on the coast we passed but one human habitation, some six miles inland\u2014the house of one of those men that live by the produce of the jungle. Darkness was beginning to fall when we emerged from the ill-marked footpath on to a deeply rutted dray-path that wound up the slopes of Khow Maun, and by the side of this path we spread our kajangs, and spent the night.\n\nMOUNG SEE said the path before us was now free from all obstruction, but as he had made the same statement every morning for the last four days, and as we had found it utterly false\u2014for it had cost us an immense amount of labour to bring the elephant that distance, owing to the obstruction offered by the numerous low branches across the road\u2014I went in front to inspect the path, and at the shoulder of the hill found that it was completely obliterated by the jungle. On the slope of the hill the rains kept the road scoured, so that vegetation could not spring up on it, but on the shoulder of the hill, the soil being left at peace, was soon seized and grown over. Sending the elephant and all superfluous baggage back, and taking a waterproof coat, a blanket, a gun, rice and fish for five days, as well as other things necessary for my business at Mergui, NUAN, MOUNG SEE and I set out together.\n\nOn the side of Khow Maun, along this dray-path, are many shallow trenches running round the hill as if at one time an army had encamped there. Just on the shoulder of the hill, a few large spreading trees shelter a considerable expanse of sward, whereon at one time stood a temple\u2014a rest-house for the overland travellers. Near by, in a ravine a little lower down, is a well with excellent clear water, for all the streams were dry, and we had been drinking from the buffalo pools, which the natives held drinkable if there was no marked odour, so that this water was very welcome. The country here is granitic, full of deep narrow ravines, and here and there we saw the deep cuttings that had been made to carry the old road through them.\nThere is a steep ascent for the last two or three hundred yards before gaining the top of the pass, which is about 750 feet above the sea level, and where there is a mound covered with all sorts of idols, but the prevailing type was a small, very fat clay elephant set upon exceedingly stunted limbs. This was an altar to the spirit of the hills, and Nuan and Moung See coming up, stooped down and made their obeisance, and Nuan in a prayer informed the spirit of my state and station, and begged he would not think hardly of me for having but two followers, and told him of the more numerous retinue I had brought away with me, and finally concluded his prayer with this promise \"and now if you will give us a safe conduct to Muang Meerit (Mergui), and keep us from robbers, tigers and all the other ills that beset travellers, we will make a great deal of merit when we safely reach our journey's end.\"\n\nOn the Burmese side everything was wet with the constant drizzle. The rain clouds must hang very low, for the range of hills here are very little over one thousand feet in height, yet they are high enough to determine the rainy season on either side. From a glimpse through the trees, which we got descending from the pass, we could see that the country in front of us was entirely covered with forest jungle, with hills in the distance. The foot-path leads down a gentle descent, and at the foot of the hills we found the country uneven, cut up by ravines, with a deep alluvial soil covered by a lofty evergreen forest. We reached a stream about seven miles from the pass, and, beneath a large tree with very thick foliage, upon its bank we spent the night.\n\nAbout ten o'clock a downpour of rain commenced. I drew my water-proof coat over my blanket, while Nuan and Moung See crouched over the fire; but the wet began to steal in all round and the rain drowned the fire, so that we waited anxiously for morning to break. As soon as we could see, we packed up our things and set out, the rain coming heavier than ever. For five miles we went through a luxuriant bamboo jungle, where we started a herd of wild buffaloes, and jungle fowl were abundant, but as we had only a Colt's repeating rifle with us we were unable to procure any for our pot. By the\nside of the path were the ruins of a brick temple, which at one time must have been rather an elaborate structure, and there the men again made their obeisance.\n\nWhen we emerged from the bamboo jungle we struck a stream coming from the S. E., shallow and about thirty feet wide. On its left bank were three dilapidated huts, where probably Chinamen or natives had resided while prospecting the stream which is reported to carry gold. We followed this stream\u2014the Klong Pan Peng\u2014for some distance, then crossed and recrossed it several times, until we reached an open space in which there was a rude hut called by Moung See \"the house of the father of the buffaloes.\" The rain cleared away, and we had time to dry our clothes and cook some food before it set in again, and continued all night.\n\nThe soil here is deep and carries lofty trees with a rich and thick undergrowth of trailing and twining plants. Ever since leaving the bamboo jungle leeches lay thickly in wait for us, but next day they surrounded us like besetting sins. On the path in front one could see a perfect little forest of miniature elephant trunks nodding on the ground, and no railway guard catches the moving foot-board so cleverly as they catch the traveller. In a clearing an attempt was made to rid ourselves of the enemy, but they boarded us quite as quickly as we could throw them over. Few travellers pass this way, and how these crowds get a living I do not know.\n\nHere and there, through this part of the jungle we came on small pieces of green sward surrounded by large trees, and sometimes we passed larger clearings. Evidently people had at one time a habitation here, and even now, during the dry season, herdsmen drive their cattle up from the lowland flats of Burma to graze in these patches and in the bamboo jungle.\n\nAbout seven miles from the field of the father of the buffaloes, this stream from the S. E., which we had followed and crossed, joins a large stream from the N. E., and just at the junction of the streams our path ran into the river. After half a day's fruitless search for it on the further side of the river amidst a constant downpour, we recrossed to a sand bank, on which we threw up a hut. We were fortunate enough, during\nour search for the path, to find a turtle weighing some 45 lbs. feeding in a marsh by the river. He seemed sadly astonished when the two men started to remove his breast plate, but he ought to have congratulated himself on escaping the sad fate of the small land tortoise which is invariably cooked by being hung over a fire and roasted alive.\n\nThe rain continued all night, and next morning the river was so flooded that we could not cross it. So a council was held and we determined to build a raft of bamboos with which to proceed down the river, although Nuan objected sadly to trust himself to the mercy of the river spirit. By four o'clock over forty bamboos had been cut, lashed together in three tiers, so that the raft had rather the appearance of a rather broad ladder. We were anxious to test its capabilities, and foolishly started that night. It went swiftly and smoothly along the flooded stream until a difference of opinion between Nuan and Moung See landed it broadside on a small island in the middle of the stream, and in a moment we were over and in the water. Luckily I had tied everything to the raft with the exception of my only pair of shoes, and when the raft was righted we found they were gone and everything soaking wet. Darkness came down, so we moored. The rain was constant; our clothes, blankets and matches wet; and the best piece of ground we could get was damp and marshy, so that we longed all night for the light of morning.\n\nThe country now became covered with jungle-clad ranges of hills, set closely together, separated only by the narrowest ravines, and rising up some 500 feet or more. These hills ran right across the course of the river, so that it seemed to dash against the first range, then eddying along its flanks burst through the first vulnerable point it reached and dashed against the next range, where it again searched for and found an exit, and so bounding and turning, rushing and eddying, it at last burst through this hilly country and sailed out on the flatter country beyond. It took us a day and an half to get through this tortuous channel, sixteen hours punting at $2\\frac{1}{2}$ miles an hour, so that to reach a point some fifteen miles distant as the crow flies we had to cover about forty.\nAfter spending such an uncomfortable night, we found ourselves just at the entrance to this hilly country. The river was now in big flood, and the rapids were full of great boulders, against which the river dashed itself. Below those rapids came great silent whirlpools in the shadow of the hills, so deep that our long bamboo punt poles failed to reach the bottom, and our raft rotated again and again. It required all our energies and wits to shoot those rapids, and often we bounced against the snags and jutting boulders, coming off as a rule with but slight damage to the raft, but more than once we were on the eve of complete disaster, when we got righted almost by miracle.\n\nWe had just shot a rapid, and were taking matters easily after our exertions, when our attention was suddenly attracted by a thundering tearing noise as of some large animal bursting through the narrow coppice between the hill and the river. Presently a great male banteng (*Bos frontalis*) appeared on the bank about fifty yards behind us, plunged into the flood and made swiftly for the other side. At one time he looked threateningly towards us, so we were glad to get rid of the brute, but just as we were turning the next bend we again heard the thunder of his hoofs, and he instantly appeared on the bank quite opposite us. As he plunged into the river the men threw their punt poles from them and cowered on the raft, while I hastily undid the fastenings of my gun and loaded it. But by that time the bull had thought better of it and had made across the river just in front of us and was ascending the opposite bank as I took a flying shot at him, but he disappeared evidently none the worse. The beast, I believe, had not the slightest intention of molesting us; but the hills threw their steep sides so close to the river, that he had to cross and recross to get along the narrow bank that was sometimes on one side sometimes on the other.\n\nA little after midday the rain ceased, and in a blink of sunshine that followed, we dried our matches and shortly afterwards moored our raft and prepared to spend the night. We made a great fire, dried our clothes and blankets, cooked the\nthe last of our rice, and threw up a rude roof of leaves, so that when the rain fell with the darkness we were prepared for it.\n\nIt required some cajoling to get NUAN to again trust his life on the raft, for said he \"Last night the river spirit came\"\u2014here NUAN held out his hands and shook his head quite despondently. But the river was the only way out of the hills; we knew dwellings could not be far off, and the river had abated somewhat; these and other inducements allowed us to again resume our journey in the morning. Early in the forenoon we came upon tracks of honey and gum-dammar collectors, and at midday we sailed out between two hills that stood as sentinels to a flat, jungle-covered country with small rounded hills scattered over it. The soil was deep and eminently suited for agricultural uses, but we saw no vestige of cultivation until the day was well spent, when we suddenly came upon a small settlement of houses. These bamboo houses were evidently of recent erection, and stood amongst plantains and maize, which grew amongst the fresh trunks of lately felled trees. The inhabitants were Siamese, most of whom had recently come over from the Provinces on the East coast, and many of them had worked as miners at Bangtaphan. Siamese priests had come up from Wat Kew, an old Siamese settlement a day's journey down the river, and had taken advantage of the flood which had made the river navigable for big boats to visit this outlying Colony of their parishioners and collect their tithes. All night long the old priest with his two young brethren were feted, so that we were allowed to spend the night there in comparative peace.\n\nNext morning the priests set out for their 'Wat,' and we obtained permission to occupy part of the boat. A little further down we reached a larger village, also a Siamese Colony\u2014for the Siamese occupy the valley of this river down to Tenasserim. There the priests stopped to take their midday meal. The headman told me he had been settled there for upwards of eight years, and that he came from the Province of Koowi. The soil, he also informed me, was much richer than any on the East Coast, and that they cultivate only a little rice, devoting their time more to the raising of\nbananas and maize, which they sell down the river, and besides they keep a good few buffaloes. I have no doubt also they enjoy the security of property and freedom from oppression under British protection.\n\nAfter they had finished their meal we set out again, the young priests 'chowing' the boat while the old man reclined within. Round about him, built in great piles were the worthy man's presents from his parishioners, consisting of great heaps of half roasted fish, baskets full of sweetmeats and fancy cakes, bags of rice and bunches of bananas, betel-nuts and coco-nuts 'galore,' in fact stores large enough to hold a great priesthood eating for weeks. In fact, so full was the boat of good things (and I believe the priests were quite as full) that, although the boat was a fairly large one, there was neither room to sit or stand, and it was quite a treat to see the old priest's little boy scrambling amongst those things to supply the betel-nut wants of his superior.\n\nThe river got wider, deeper and flowed more slowly, but the surrounding country was still of the same character\u2014flat and jungle-covered, with rounded hills here and there. By landing some distance above Wat Keo and walking over a neck of land, we were able to cut a good few miles of the river and reach the 'Wat' that night, where we slept. A beautiful park surrounds the abode of the priests, and the Wat is built after the Burmese design, but all the priests are Siamese, some of them coming from the Provinces on the East Coast. The village of Wat Keo (or Takay as it is called on the maps) has about 400 inhabitants, mostly Siamese, and is surrounded by large paddy fields and extensive pasture land. Nuan had now an opportunity of fulfilling his vow, for in his hour of danger he had promised the water spirit, at the first Wat he reached, to make merit to the extent of ten ticals, but now was quite convinced it was a rash promise and considered three ticals quite enough.\n\nNext morning we left Wat Keo and proceeded further down the river. Only two house-boats were available, both belonging to local trading Chinamen, and these, practising their usual policy on the stranger, extracted three times the\ncustomary amount, and no doubt divided the profits. Moreover the boat was small, one had to crawl into it, and when there lie on one's back. The Chinaman was an old Perak miner who had come up to Mergui, married a woman of the country, started trading on the river, and now had two daughters to assist him in 'chowing' the boat.\n\nThe following morning we arrived at Tenasserim, once the proud capital of a kingdom of that name. Its ruler, its power, its people and its fleet are all gone, and all that remains to mark its ancient claims of a Venice of the East is the dilapidated remains of a terrace leading up from the river. The inhabitants are mostly Burmese and do not number more than 600, and there seems to be no life in the place. Yet it occupies a situation surpassingly fine. The foot of the high bank on which it sits is swept by the smaller Tenasserim River, which a little below the town bends to meet the larger river coming circling from the North and enclosing between them an expansive 'haugh' of green sward. The 'haugh', the circling rivers and the town are enclosed in a circuit of forest-clad hills, so that Tenasserim sits on the South side of an amphitheatre.\n\nJust as we were leaving Tenasserim, two little Burmese boys came running down to the boat and asked in good English \"Where are you going, Sir?\" They were wonderfully intelligent lads; they attended school in Mergui, but were then home for holidays, their father being a merchant in Tenasserim.\n\nThe river between Mergui and Tenasserim is broad and deep, in many parts it really looks like a series of lakes surrounded by hills; and here and there along its banks are fishing villages. During the rainy season steam launches, drawing four or five feet of water, can go to Tenasserim, and formerly one of the British India steamships used to pass up the river to within eight miles of Tenasserim, where her further passage was prevented by a bar of rocks that cross the river there.\n\nThe mouth of the river is surrounded by numerous swampy mangrove-covered islands, and sailing along these we came\nin sight of Mergui next forenoon. The town contains about 15,000 inhabitants, and is the capital of the southern part of Lower Burma. The Government houses are situated on a small plateau that rises from the town with the native houses\u2014mostly built of wood\u2014round it reaching down to the water's edge. The inhabitants are mostly Burmese, but Chinamen are the active traders.\n\nNuan went ashore and procured me shoes and other necessaries, and fitted me out more as a Chinaman than as a European, to face civilization. I was most hospitably entertained by Mr. Batten and Mr. Hughes, and after a few days left on board the S. S. Mergui to return to Bangtaphan via the isthmus of Kra.\nTHE THERMAL SPRINGS OF SELANGOR AND MALACCA.\n\nBY\n\nDR. W. BOTT, F.C.S., F.G.C.S., &c.\n\nThe following account represents a brief summary of the results of two official visits to Selangor and Malacca undertaken in August and November, 1890, respectively. Many of the results have already appeared in the report published by Government.\n\nA great many details\u2014such as description of apparatus employed, methods of collecting gases, and analytical methods used, which really form the most valuable part of the paper from a strictly scientific point of view\u2014have been omitted, as being obviously not suitable for publication in this Journal; these will be found in the complete paper which will shortly be published in England and Germany (Proc. Royal Soc. and Berlin Chem. Soc.). In reference to the analytical data given, I wish to point out, that these only represent the approximate composition of the water of the springs, owing to unavoidable admixture of ordinary surface water in most cases. I hope at a future date to be able to visit these springs again, provided with such apparatus and appliances as will enable me to collect the water absolutely free from foreign admixtures. The numbers given, however, if not absolutely true, will, I believe, be found to require but a trifling correction in each case.\nGENERAL NATURE OF THE SPRINGS.\n\nAll the springs visited by me and described more fully later on, belong to the class of \"Simple Thermal Waters,\" viz., they are characterised by a high temperature, but do not contain any considerable amount of dissolved mineral matter. This circumstance, and the small amount of lime in the water, seems to indicate that all these springs rise from silicious and not from calcareous tracts, although no strictly reliable relation can ordinarily be established in such cases between the chemical nature of a spring and its ultimate source. The immediate and obvious surroundings of the springs are old granitic formations. This also applies to those springs which are situated in padi swamps, and where granite, though not apparent, is found below the mud surface. In addition to common and porphyritic granite, quartz, as rock and pebbles, diorite, gneiss and greissen (a kind of granite practically free from felspar which often forms the matrix of tin lodes) are found, but limestone is not apparent. The latter remark, however, does not apply to the springs of Ulu Selangor, which I was unable to visit in person.\n\nThe springs themselves appear as pools or puddles of hot water, varying in area from 1 to 3 or more square yards, and generally fed by two or more distinct streams or jets issuing from holes and crevices in the bottom of the basin. Bubbles of gas are observed continually to emerge with these jets and ascend through the supernatant hot water. These consist essentially of nitrogen and carbon dioxide with a small quantity of hydrogen sulphide and traces of hydrogen and marsh gas. The presence of hydrogen sulphide is apparent from the sulphurous smell in the vicinity of the springs and the water itself owes to this gas a slight smell and taste. The beds of the springs consist of granitic rock more or less decomposed on the surface and coated with silicious sinter. The floor of these beds is covered with all kinds of loose vegetable and mineral debris in the form of granular sediment or soft fibrous and gelatinous masses. The latter accumulate in parts and often form a thick continuous layer on\nthe surface of the water having a green and in some cases a bright orange red colour. The consistency and general appearance of this substance varies from a loose, fibrous structure resembling soft, dense moss, to a gelatinous, homogeneous texture not unlike India-rubber. A careful microscopical examination of these masses showed that they consist of decayed organic matter derived from leaves and other vegetable substances which find their way into the water and undergo decomposition at a comparatively high temperature. They represent a dense magma of cells of most variable shape and appearance, representative of almost every kind of vegetable cell in existence. How far this growth may be looked upon as a whole, as an individual, as a living thing increasing actively, or a dead product growing passively by mechanical addition,\u2014these are questions of considerable interest, to be settled by a separate investigation, and I hope to discuss this subject fully in a future paper. In several specimens of the vegetable matter from Ulu Klang and Setapak, a distinct form of alg\u00e6 was found, and I have since been informed, that similar specimens had been found in Ayer Panas water, Malacca, and sent to the British Museum for examination. It appears, however, that this has led to no further results. The temperature of the springs ranges from about $100^\\circ$ to $185^\\circ$ F. in Selangor, and $95^\\circ$ to $130^\\circ$ F. in Malacca. It varies moreover in each spring according to the distance from the feeders, being highest at the point where they enter.\n\nA number of complete analyses were made of the air in the vicinity of the springs. The air was found to be of normal composition though free from active oxygen or ozone. Air collected close to the springs was found to contain traces of hydrogen sulphide and rather more than the normal amount of carbonic acid and ammonia. The details of these analyses will be given subsequently.\n\nAll the springs contain a considerable amount of dissolved silica. On keeping samples of the water part of this is deposited in a pulverulent state, sometimes, however, very thin, soft, transparent, glistening films separate from the water and these on analysis are found to consist of silica, organic matter and traces of sulphur.\nSPRINGS IN SELANGOR.\n\nSetapak Spring.\n\nTemperature, ... 47-50\u00b0 Centigrade (118-122\u00b0 Fahrenheit).\nTotal solids dissolved in water, 18.35 grains per gallon.\nChlorine, ... 0.4 \"\nHardness, ... 3.6 \"\nFree Ammonia, ... 0.036 parts per million.\nAlbuminoid Ammonia, ... 0.10 \"\n\nThe quantity of dissolved constituents amounts to $3.10^{10}8$ parts in 10,000 of the water, viz.:\n\nCalcium Carbonate, ... 0.23 parts in 10,000.\nCalcium Sulphate, ... 0.25 \"\nMagnesium, ... 0.014 \"\nSodium, ... 0.21 \"\nPotassium, ... 0.08 \"\nSodium Carbonate, ... 0.43 \"\nAmmonium, ... 0.00108 \"\nSodium Chloride, ... 0.043 \"\nPotassium, ... 0.005 \"\nLithium, ... trace \"\nSodium Sulphide, ... 0.025 \"\nBoric Acid, ... trace \"\nCarbonic Acid, ... 0.71 \"\nNitrogen, ... 0.09 \"\nHydrogen Sulphide, ... 0.034 \"\nOrganic Matter, ... 0.120 \"\nSilica, ... 0.859 \"\n\n$3.10^{10}8$ \"\n\nThe gases escaping from the spring were collected and analysed, giving the following percentage composition:\n\nNitrogen, ... 97 %\nCarbonic Acid, ... 2.5%\nHydrogen Sulphide, ... 0.5%\nHydrogen, ... trace.\nMarsh Gas, ... \"\n\nTotal, ... 100.00.\nA number of analyses were also made of samples of air collected close to the spring, and the following mean results were obtained:\n\nOxygen, ... 20.885% by volume.\nNitrogen, ... 79.115%\nCarbonic Acid, ... 0.06%\n\nThe ammonia was determined separately and amounted to 0.055 parts by weight in 1,000 of air.

I do not for the present attach any importance to this circumstance, as it may be a purely sporadic occurrence; yet it might be worth while to obtain a proper sample taken from a large quantity of the rock near Ulu Klang and have it tested for gold. I am not aware whether or not gold has ever been found or been supposed to exist at Ulu Klang.\n\n**SPRINGS IN MALACCA.**\n\nThe springs found in Malacca in all respects closely resemble the Selangor Springs (see under General Nature of the Springs). One spring at Cherana Puteh is situated in the jungle, those at Ayer Panas and Alor Gajah occur in padi swamps. The latter two have been properly set for bathing purpose, so I can say nothing about their original condition and appearance. The spring at Cherana Puteh appears as a pool or puddle of hot water in a bed of dark grey mud from which bubbles of gas are continually ascending. At the time of my visit a little brook was flowing close to the spring and mixing with it to a certain extent. No line of demarcation between the brook and the water from the spring was visible, but could be readily detected with a thermometer; the differences observed are worthy of note (see sketch below).\nIt will be noticed that within small distances of a foot or even 6 inches the temperature varies very considerably. The points marked \\( \\times \\) indicate places where the temperature was taken, those marked \\( \\oplus \\) mark the entrance of feeders or \"eyes\" of the spring, and naturally possess the highest temperature.\n\n**Spring at Ayer Panas.**\n\nThe temperature of this water varies considerably in the different tanks or wells in which the spring has been collected.\n\n**a.** Tanks inside house.\n- No. 1 = 45\u00b0 Centigrade (113\u00b0 Fahrenheit).\n- No. 2 = 35\u00b0 (95\u00b0).\n- No. 3 = 45\u00b0 (113\u00b0).\n- No. 4 = 52\u00b0 (123\u00b0).\n\n**b.** Tank outside house on ground immediately adjoining.\n- No. 5 = 55\u00b0 Centigrade (131\u00b0 Fahrenheit).\n\n**c.** Tank in padi swamp behind house.\n- No. 6 = 52\u00b0 Centigrade (125\u00b0 Fahrenheit).\n\n**d.** Tanks in front of house in the field.\n- (Left) No. 7 = 33\u00b0 Centigrade (91\u00b0 Fahrenheit).\n- (Right) No. 8 = 48\u00b0 (118\u00b0).\n\nAnalysis of water taken from hottest tank, No. 5:\n\nTotal solids dissolved in the water, 18.40 grains per gallon.\n\n- Hardness, ... ... 2.5 \"\n- Chlorine, ... ... 0.7 \"\n- Free Ammonia, ... ... 0.05 parts per million.\n- Albuminoid Ammonia, ... ... 0.05 \"\n\nConstituents dissolved in 10,000 parts of the water:\n- Calcium Carbonate, ... ... 0.160 parts in 10,000\n- Calcium Sulphate, ... ... 0.180 \"\n- Magnesium ,, ... ... 0.015 \"\n- Sodium ,, ... ... 0.190 \"\n- Potassium ,, ... ... 0.085 \"\n- Sodium Carbonate, ... ... 0.450 \"\n- Ammonium ,, ... ... 0.00018,, \"\nSodium Chloride ... 0.095 parts in 10,000\nPotassium \" ... 0.006 \" \"\nSodium Sulphide, \" ... 0.020 \" \"\nHydrogen \" ... 0.025 \" \"\nCarbonic Acid, \" ... 0.585 \" \"\nNitrogen, \" ... 0.085 \" \"\nSilica, \" ... 0.780 \" \"\nOrganic Matter, \" ... 0.250 \" \"\n\nTotal, ... 2.92618 \" \"\n\nSPRING NEAR ALOR GAJAH.\n\nPart of this spring has been collected in a tank inside a little house, part of it rises in the bed of a little brook close to this house, and a third outlet has been set and received in a square bricked trough or well.

All the springs, however, contain Hydrogen Sulphide, and although the quantity present is sufficient to warrant their being classed with \"Sulphurous Waters\" in the strict sense of the word, yet it suffices to impart to them a distinct therapeutic value. In addition to this, their temperature is an important item, considered medicinally. There are a number of well-known springs in Europe, which owe their virtues apparently to their temperature only and contain as little or less mineral matter than the Selangor springs and less Hydrogen Sulphide or none at all (Matlock; Buxton; Wildbad; Aix en Provence).\n\nAmong the Selangor springs Ulu Klang ranks first as possessing the highest temperature and containing most Hydrogen Sulphide. The remainder may be placed in order of merit thus:\u2014Setapak; Dusun Tua; Semunieh; Gombah. Ulu Selangor would probably be the last in the list, although I cannot say so definitely, as I did not personally inspect and examine this spring. In any case it would come after Setapak.\nOn reference to the data of analysis of the Ulu Klang and Setapak waters, it will be seen that they contain the following amounts of Hydrogen Sulphide dissolved in every 10,000 parts of the water:\n\nUlu Klang, ... 0.035 (Temp. 151\u00b0 F.).\nSetapak, ... 0.034 (\" 122\u00b0 F.).\n\nNow the average amount of Hydrogen Sulphide in cold sulphurous springs may be taken as 0.090 parts in 10,000; hence the Ulu Klang and Setapak contain a very fair fraction of this amount and possess a high temperature at the same time. Both of them may, therefore, be recommended for bathing or drinking purposes. Their action would be stimulating and diaphoretic, and they would be found valuable in:\n\nChronic Skin Diseases and Rheumatism; Chlorosis; Amenorrhoea; Secondary Syphilis; Dyspepsia due to disordered action of the liver. I do not think it practicable to bottle and sell the water, as this would result in the loss of almost all its volatile and valuable constituents by evaporation and subsequent decomposition. The water should be used on the spot and as nearly at the temperature of the spring as may be found endurable.\n\nThe suggestions arising from the above are:\n\nI.\u2014That the hot springs in Selangor, more particularly those at Ulu Klang and Setapak, are by virtue of their temperature and chemical composition therapeutically valuable.\n\nII.\u2014The springs at Ulu Klang and Setapak should be properly set and made available for bathing and drinking purposes. It is almost needless to say that every care should be taken to prevent any communication between the water used for bathing and drinking purposes respectively.\n\nIt should be mentioned here that the Malays and Chinese seem to be well aware of the virtues of these springs, and particularly of their specific action in skin diseases. They bathe in them freely, and I am informed that the Chinese more or less monopolise some springs, the Malays others. As far as I could learn they never drink the water.\nUltimate Origin of the Springs.\n\nThe geology of the springs is a subject of great interest, but unfortunately one not to be approached or settled in an easy, off-hand manner. Much patient study of actual sections in the immediate vicinity of the springs, examination of deeper strata by boring, in short a complete geological survey alone, can throw light upon this question. One is accustomed to associate hot springs with volcanic action, yet these springs occur in parts far distant from any known volcanic belt.\n\nNo basalt and no minerals indicative of direct volcanic action are to be found in the neighbourhood. The composition of the water is, in some respects, similar to the water ejected by the geysers of Iceland, but here the analogy ends. Beyond conjectures pure and simple, I can at present pronounce no opinion as to the final source of these springs, viz., the question of direct volcanic action or simple intra-terrestrial heat. I sincerely hope, however, to have an opportunity to follow up this subject later on.\n\nIn conclusion, I wish to refer to a paper by Mons. Stanislas Meunier published in J. cx, p. 1085 of the Compt. Rend. 'Examen chimique d'eaux min\u00e9rales provenant de Malair\u00e9. Mineral d'etain de formation actuelle.' The paper describes the analysis of two bottles of water brought by Mons. J. Errington de la Croix from Ayer Panas and Cheras, and contains the following statements among others:\n\n1.\u2014The water had a bad smell on opening bottle.\n2.\u2014On heating it gave off gas bubbles.\n3.\u2014On evaporation it left a syrupy residue which was incinerated and gave two milligrams of ash per 100 cc. water taken.\n4.\u2014Exposed to the air for a few hours the water fills itself with white, viscous vegetations not botanically determined.\n5.\u2014The Ayer Panas water had no taste; the Cheras water no smell, but a slightly saline taste, and on heating gave off myriads of gas, probably pure Nitrogen amounting to 10 cc. per litre.\n6.\u2014The water contained Chlorine, but no Sulphates, and about 1.4 grams Sodium Chloride per litre.\n\n7.\u2014A mineral found in the spring is described, having a spec. gravity 2.1, cavernous and tuberculous structure, whitish grey colour with small black dendritic particles in it. The composition of this is given as:\n\n| Substance     | Percentage |\n|---------------|------------|\n| Silica        | 91.8       |\n| Water         | 7.5        |\n| Tin Oxide     | 0.5        |\n| Iron          | 0.2        |\n| Aluminium     | traces     |\n\n100.0\n\nFrom this the author draws the remarkable conclusion that this substance is a kind of opal similar to geyserite, but containing tin as a peculiar and characteristic constituent.\n\nHe goes on to say that this is the first time that tin has been found in *statu nascenti* as it were, viz., in the act of deposition from its mother liquor, and looks upon this as an important contribution to the theory of the formation of tin ore.\n\nIt needs but a glance at the statements above cited to show that they are of no value at all, in fact mostly absurd, but I append a few remarks upon these points, lest a casual reader of the paper should be deceived by them and attach credit to the grand but unfortunately erroneous deduction (No. 7) in which that paper culminates. It seems strange that matter so devoid of point and substance should have found its way into the Compt. Rend.:\n\n1. **Bad Smell.**\u2014Most waters would have a bad smell after being carried from Selangor to France.\n\n2. **Bubbles on heating.**\u2014All water, unless specially treated, gives off bubbles on heating.\n\n3. **Syrupy Residue on evaporation.**\u2014The water leaves a solid residue. The ash is more than 4 milligrams per 100 cc.\n\n4. **White, viscous vegetations.**\u2014These are probably the\nsiliceous deposits mentioned in my paper. They do not form in a few hours as stated, and the water does not fill itself with them.\n\n6. No Sulphates, but about 1.4 grams Sodium Chloride per litre.\u2014The water naturally contains Sulphates, and the Chloride amounts to 0.015 grams at most.\n\n7. The description given is that of common sinter met with in all hot springs, almost without exception. As for the tin in it, it would be difficult in these parts to pick up a mineral which did not contain a trace of tin, as is well enough known. There is absolutely nothing remarkable in the presence of tin in this sinter, the very granite upon which it grows carries traces of tin. The bold theory of tin oxide being deposited from water containing Sulphuretted Hydrogen is not compatible with chemical laws, is a chemical impossibility.\n\nI desire to add that I have appended the above remarks purely by way of correcting erroneous statements, and nothing is further from my thoughts than \"sitting on\" the author of them. It must be borne in mind that he could only work with a small sample sent to him in France, and which probably arrived in a more or less altered condition. He never saw the springs nor the water fresh from them.\n\nW. BOTT.\nNOTES ON THE SIAMESE PROVINCES OF KOOWI, BANGTAPHAN, PATEEO AND CHAMPOON.\n\nBY\n\nARTHUR KEITH, M.B., C.M.\n\nTheir Position and Outstanding Features.\n\nIn that part of the Malay Peninsula lying between 10\u00b0 20' and 12\u00b0 N. Latitude, the backbone range of hills almost skirts the East coast and thus between the hills and the sea lies a narrow strip of country, the northernmost part forming the province of Koowi; Bangtaphan, Pateeo and Champoon following in order towards the South. This backbone range, covered evenly over with deep jungle like the plain that lies between it and the sea, averages in height some 1,600 feet above the sea level, but at Khow Pra it reaches some 3,500 feet, while it attains 4,326 feet\u2014its highest point\u2014in Khow Luang, standing as the boundary wall between Burma and Siam. It is broken here and there by gaps, honoured by the name of passes, the best known of which perhaps is that of Kra, 250 feet above sea level, lying at the southern extremity of the piece of country of which I write, and frequented by the Siamese living in the Pak-chan valley when visiting their relatives in Champoon; while better known in former times and lying quite at the other extremity, the pass of Koowi, some 750 feet above sea level, affords the colony of Siamese living in the valley of the smaller Tenasserim River, a rude path to their native provinces on the East Coast. Between\nthese two lie ill-marked crossings at Krat, Paron and Bangtaphanoi, the last being used by the Siamese living in the Lenya valley; but the truth of the matter is that the numerous bands of dacoits that infest this region cross anywhere (vide map). To the seaward of the main ridge, and for the greater part running parallel to it, are numerous small ranges, while scattered hills rise with their burden of forest jungle over the plain and thickly skirt the coast, often standing into the sea as promontories offering their bluff side to the waves; and one can see that the same features characterise the seabottom\u2014the hills rising from the water as numerous jungle-covered islands.\n\nProminent Geological Features.\n\nThe basis of the backbone ridge is a rough-grained granite, rapidly decomposing when exposed to the atmosphere, and the streams flowing from it (as indeed is the case almost everywhere in the Peninsula) often carry tin and more frequently and more abundantly titanic oxide of iron. Lying on the granite and rising as the basis of the small ranges of hills is a semi-metamorphosed clay-slate much broken up, non-fossiliferous and probably of the Cambrian period, which forms the \"country rock.\" To the seaward of this slate and lying on it, runs a great bed of conglomerate rock, composed of flat, water-worn slate pebbles and roughly rounded pieces of quartz welded together by a red clay containing much iron. Its stratification is much disturbed, and it sometimes rises into low hills. Where the slate and this conglomerate meet, one frequently finds great outcrops of a porphyritic rock evidently that of the Mergui series, and here also one finds large outcrops of gold-bearing quartz as in the concession of the Goldfields of Siam Company. Again it can be seen further South in Champoon where another mine has been opened out. (Vide Map.) In the beds of the streams running through these quartz-bearing parts, one finds gold, and sometimes for a mile or more inland from either bank alluvial gold occurs along its sides for long stretches, but from its comparatively even distribution and level deposition one has to look for\nsome means other than the river to account for its presence here and thus. Still proceeding seawards, and having crossed this land of conglomerate, one again comes to the \"country rock\"\u2014metamorphosed clay slate. On the coast, laterite is abundant, often forming low cliffs, but the hills skirting the sea and most of the islands are of a limestone that gives forth a metallic ring when struck.\n\n**Limestone Hills and Caves.**\n\nAbout a mile to the West of the village of Bangtaphan, raising its somewhat flattish top some five hundred feet above the surrounding alluvial plain with its old sea beaches, is a rather typical limestone hill with a sloping side to the land, and like others of its kind, a steepish side to the sea sheltering the mouths of numerous caves of various sorts and sizes. To gain the principal cave, one ascends some fifty feet to find the mouth as sharply cut as, and somewhat after the manner of, a cathedral door, and as the cave retreats from its mouth it increases in every dimension. The floor, running backwards for some 80 feet, mounts in three great tiers some 60 feet wide, the last and highest tier being sacred to a gilt Bhudda with a perfect myriad of leaden apostles round about him, for the cave is used as an occasional place of worship, as these caves commonly are in Siam. The roof rises in vaults, the highest of all rising to some forty feet and is pierced by what the Scottish people familiarly know as a \"Hell's Lum.\" From the shape of the caves, from those \"Hell's Lums,\" and from their situation on the steep side facing the sea, one naturally concludes they are the result of sea-action. One can see lines, more or less parallel to the surface slope of the hill running along the walls of those caves, as if they demarcated concentric layers which had been deposited by some spring that rose in the centre of the hill, overflowed, and laved its sides, and the not uncommon nearly concave top lends some support to such a guess. It seems highly probable that out of the solidified debris in the floors of those caves, animal remains, recent or otherwise, might be obtained, although a search made in those of Borneo (see the Society's Journal for\n1879)\u2014was practically negative, but the religious purposes to which these caves are put deters one from actively pursuing operations.\n\nThese limestone hills and caves seem fairly well distributed along either coast of the Peninsula\u2014seldom I believe rising many hundred feet above sea level. On the West coast away as far North as Moulmein, one finds similar hills with famous caves\u2014also used as temples; in the Lenya valley again there are said to be some remarkable specimens, and there are others in Selangor, Kedah and Pahang, besides in many of the islands lying along that coast. In the four Siamese provinces they are common, and at Pateco a group of these limestone hills rises from the sea like a great set of decapitated sugar cones, while away much further North beyond these provinces, at Petcheburee, there is a famous cave containing a gigantic wooden image of Bhudda. Among the islands and shores along the Eastern side of the Gulf of Siam one comes across them, while they abound in North Borneo.\n\nThe Rising of the Land.\n\nAssuming then that these caves are the result of sea-action, as in all probability they are, and seeing that some of them are now high and dry some hundred feet or more, we may conclude that the land has at any rate risen that amount in recent times. A writer in this Journal for 1879, discussing those limestone hills and caves in North Borneo, concludes that that part of the island had risen about 500 feet in recent times, and before I saw that article I had concluded that at any rate the land in these four provinces lying three hundred feet above the sea level had emerged from the water in a recent era. Mason, in his work on Burma, gives it as his belief that the Burmese coast is rising, and states that the land on the other side of the Bay of Bengal is sinking. Probably the whole great tract of country\u2014almost the whole of the Indo-China Peninsula\u2014over which this limestone formation occurs is rising; at any rate that small part of which I write, I believe to be in course of elevation. In the great flat plain,\nsloping from the hills to the sea, one finds extensive beds of clay almost of one level and sloping towards the sea, and over this again great beds of evidently sea-rolled gravel also comparatively at one level and of an even thickness, lying some 450 feet above the present sea level. The hills have their sloping sides to the mainland, and their steep sides\u2014often sea-marked cliffs\u2014to the sea. Then again (see vertical section across Province of Bangtaphan at lower right-hand corner of map) going towards and within two miles of the sea, one crosses undulating and wavy old sea beaches of sand following each other in rapid succession. Lem Tong Lan (vide section) is a hill standing out to the sea with the usual characteristic shape and joined to the land by a muddy isthmus, over which old inhabitants say it used to be possible to sail at high water with a boat, which is now impossible. The section running through Koh Yeu shows that island with its sloping side in very shallow water towards the land, while that towards the surf is steep and faces deep water. The shape of those islands and hills, this little tongue of land joining Lem Tong Lan to the mainland, these old sea beaches, the limestone caves, and the other recent geological formations even in the absence of recent marine remains, seem to point to the land having risen and still to be rising, but of course in this extension seawards of the land deposition has played a considerable part.\n\nThe River System and the Effects of Deposition.\n\nIn this narrow strip of country the rivulets from the main range and subsidiary hills meet on the plain below to form considerable streams which, running over beds of sand and gravel, make on the whole a straight course across the plain to the sea. One of those streams has seldom more than 150 square miles of a drainage area, but the river of Champoon, like the large streams draining the other side, and like the rivers of the Peninsula in general, runs parallel to the main range of hills for the greater part of its course until, near its termination, it turns outwards to end in the sea, and thus drains an area of about 450 square miles\u2014three times that of\nany of the other streams. On the West side, on the other hand, with an area almost three times as great to be drained, the place of those babbling small streams is taken by comparatively large rivers; the Pak Chan has a drainage area of 600 square miles, the Linya 800 square miles, and the smaller Tenasserim River has over 2,000 square miles of a drainage area. These rivers on the West side, with their large drainage areas, receiving a rainfall fully double that of those smaller ones on the East coast, and carrying an infinitely larger volume of water with its inherent properties of disintegration, denudation, transportation and deposition, represent powerful factors at work on the Burmese side almost absent in these four Siamese Provinces. Sandy beaches form the seaboard of these, with sand bars at the mouths of the streams, and with patches of mangrove in the narrow marshes and pools between the more recent of the old sea beaches. The Champoon River, however, partaking of the rainfall as well as of the character of these rivers on the West side, is surrounded at the mouth by great mud-banks, large mangrove swamps and tracts of rich alluvial soil. On the West coast these evidences of deposition are extremely extensive, for the islands lend a calm to the water round the mouths of the rivers favourable to the settling of suspended matter, and the mangrove trees stepping further and further into the water as subsidence goes on highly favour further deposition among the roots; so that deposition and extension of the mangrove swamps proceed pari passu. Knowing somewhat of the drainage area of a river one may roughly guess, from the extent of mangrove swamp surrounding its mouth, the rainfall of the district.\n\nLately, at the mouth of the Krat River, on the eastern shore of the Gulf of Siam, I came across some remarkable evidence of the rate of deposition. The Krat River, rising at the western side of the Battambong Hills, drains an area of some 250 square miles, with a rainfall of probably 200 inches per annum, and runs through a clay country, a considerable extent of which is cultivated, so that it carries a great deal of matter in suspension. In 1859 H. M. Saracen laid down the\nislands at the mouth of this river showing wide channels between them and the mainland. Now those islands are almost in contact with the mainland; roughly guessing I should say some 500 acres have come above high-water mark since then.\n\n**Meteorological.**\n\nThe main range of hills, although only 1,600 feet in height, determines the rainy season on the West side with the S.W. Monsoon, while in these four provinces on the East side with the N.E. Monsoon. But with the exception of some heavy downfalls in November and December, there is little of a rainy season, rain falling more or less all the year through.\n\n**Rainfall at Paron, Bangtaphan, for 1890.**\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | April | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. |\n|------|------|------|-------|-----|------|------|------|-------|------|------|------|\n| 1.5  | 3.1  | 1.5  | 5.7   | 4.5 | 1.2  | 3.5  | 4.6  | 3.4   | 8.2  | 5.2  | 20.6 |\n\nThe total rainfall for 1890 at Bangtaphan was 63 inches, but at Mergui, on the other side of the Peninsula, it was over 200 inches. The change of the Monsoon always came gradually. Towards the end of April the wind veered towards the South and kept changing, so that May was half spent before it finally settled in the S.W. So again in October; for several days it may have blown from the N.E. and again returned to the S.W., so that November had well begun before we enjoyed those steady cold breezes from the N.E. that gave a piquancy to life.\n\nIn May, the hottest month of the year, the thermometer in the shade registered on an average $84.5^\\circ$ at 9 a.m. and $91^\\circ$ at midday, while at night it never sunk below $75^\\circ$. But in December, I have seen the minimum thermometer register outside $59^\\circ$, and in the shade $65^\\circ$ at night.\nThe Jungle Covering.\n\nJungle forest sweeps evenly over the Provinces of Koowi and Bangtaphan, but is interrupted in Pateeo by a large tract of grass country\u2014of most interesting origin\u2014but occurs again in Champoon although of a much less primitive nature than that in the two northern provinces. Rather stunted trees, surrounded by and supporting numerous twining and climbing shrubs, cover the hills with a thick, almost impenetrable undergrowth. In the valleys, near the backbone ridge, on the other hand, grow lofty trees affording valuable timber, shading a damp green undergrowth of sapling-like shrubs. In the plain, at the foot of the smaller hills, are large tracts of bamboo forest, while the jungle extending over the plain is much the same as that occurring in the valleys. Various species of figs are extremely common, and fine gum-dammar trees occur all over these provinces and are farmed out for their oil. The oil exudes into small wells dug out of the trunk some four feet from the ground, and the exudation is at times stimulated by setting fire to the oil in the well. It is mostly used for making torches; bast is dipped in the oil, wrapt into a banana leaf, the whole tied up with pieces of rattan constituting a torch\u2014one of the principal articles of export.\n\nIn the month of December, the leaves begin to fall, so that by the beginning of March, just before many of the trees burst into bloom, large tracts of the drier jungle are comparatively leafless. In many of these trees this shedding of the leaf is likely due to some physiological adaptation; in others that bloom while in this leafless condition, it may be to increase the display and attractiveness or facilitate the means for fertilization; and in some possibly it may be a bequest from some distant ancestor that grew in a temperate climate.\n\nCompetition for life is keen in the jungle, and although I have no statistics to offer, I believe there is a high rate of mortality amongst the jungle trees. Tottering trees infested with white ants abound, the fig trees are everywhere making victims, and after a slight gale many trunks lie prone with tons of soil upturned with their roots. When the trunk has\nrotted away, this soil remains as if it were a broken piece of an earth-dyke by the side of a shallow trench\u2014very puzzling until one knows their origin. In time the rain blots them out, but from their abundance one can see that this is one of nature's methods of ploughing the jungle ground and must play not an unimportant part among the more important factors in altering the face of the land.\n\nThe sappan-wood tree is abundant, so are many species of rattan, but these with the dammar oil are the only jungle products exported from those provinces.\n\n*The Grass Country of Pateeo.*\n\nThe jungle suddenly ceases at Bangtaphannoi, and from there southwards to beyond the village of Pateeo where the jungle again appears in patches, stretches an undulating country waving with lalang grass some sixty square miles in extent. Some twenty-seven years ago, so the people say\u2014people that saw what they tell\u2014a great typhoon crossed the Peninsula here, levelling nearly every tree as it came and included villages in the ruin, so that not a few human lives were lost. A fire following completed the work and left an open, blackened country that speedily became covered with grass that took the place of the former thick jungle forest. Here and there still stand charred stumps, while heaps of ashes covered with grass and half buried fallen boles of trees through which one's foot sinks when walking, abound everywhere. Towards the confines of this open country, the hills have their slopes facing the S.W., denuded of jungle and grass-covered, while their slopes towards the N.E. still retain their thick covering of trees. Every year the grass is set on fire and burns its border line a little further into the jungle, so that steadily it increases. The edge of the jungle, like the border of an unhealthy wound, shows no robustness nor vitality, and falls an easy pray to the all-devouring annual flames.\n\nThe result of the action of these warring elements has been to totally alter the climatic conditions, the fauna and the flora of this small locality. A few species of grass have supplanted the numerous forms of jungle growth; the small\nbarking deer and the black leopard abound on it, with a few wild buffaloes. But there is not a human habitation upon it, notwithstanding the abundant pasture, for the Siamese keep cattle only as a means of transport and labour.\n\nOld Paddy Fields.\n\nWith the exception of the grass country of Pateeoo all the other open spaces in the jungle, which although numerous seldom exceed forty acres in extent, are old paddy-fields cleared at one time for cultivation by man. When a piece of jungle has been cleared for hill-paddy and the crop reaped and carried away, the old tree stumps sprout, young saplings spring up, and the jungle soon regains its own; but in the low-lying level alluvial ground prepared for 'wet' paddy, and which is usually put under a course of crops, thick grass springs up, and being set on fire every dry season drives the jungle quite as far back as it is able to regain during the rains, so that it becomes a permanent opening in the jungle.\n\nThe Rice Crop.\n\nAlthough small patches of tobacco are grown, and one may see cotton trees, plantains, coco-nut and betel-nut palms in gardens surrounding the houses, yet rice is by far the chief crop of those four provinces. The rice-fields lie upon the flat, alluvial soil surrounding the villages, which are invariably situated upon the banks of a stream towards its mouth. In the end of July, low earthen walls are thrown up, dividing this land into plots containing about one square rood, and the soil turned over by means of a rude wooden plough. As soon as rain falls buffaloes are turned out to trample and soften the soil and to further prepare it for sowing, they are yoked to a log of wood set with wooden teeth and the ground thus harrowed. A small seed bed is prepared, and rice sown extremely thickly, and when the crowded plants have got their heads some six inches above the ground they are transplanted and set one by one some eight inches apart in the plots already prepared by ploughing and harrowing. By the end of November, the crop is ripe, the heads are cut and gathered by\nthe sickle, and the grain trampled out on the threshing-floor by buffaloes. The paddy is stored away in small raised bamboo houses specially made for the purpose.\n\nAn extremely small proportion of the land is under cultivation\u2014less than 2%. Those four provinces include 2,200 square miles of the King of Siam's kingdom, and out of these 2,200 square miles about 3\u00be square miles only are under cultivation. An average crop produces about 1,000 lbs. of clean rice, so that in an average year the total production in these provinces would be about 2,300,000 lbs of rice. This has to feed a population of some 16,500 souls\u2014rather less than one half pound per head per diem\u2014for as far as I know, there is neither export nor import in this commodity. A man and his wife could with ease cultivate four acres of rice and produce 4,000 lbs of rice, but nearly everyone grows his own supply only, and very few cultivate that amount.\n\nFrom passing through those provinces and residing in them, I believe their size, acreage under cultivation, and population are approximately what I here tabulate:\n\n| Province     | Total square mileage | Acres cultivated | Population |\n|--------------|----------------------|------------------|------------|\n| Champoon,    | 740                  | 800              | 6,000      |\n| Pateeo,      | 450                  | 500              | 3,000      |\n| Bangtaphan,  | 480                  | 300              | 2,500      |\n| Koowi,       | 560                  | 700              | 5,000      |\n\n**Fishing Industry.**\n\nIn the dietary of the Siamese, fish occupies almost as important a place as rice, and although every Siamese is partly an agriculturist, yet there are many that devote their lives entirely to either calling. All the villages have easy access\nto the sea; along the shore are many small collections of fishermen's houses, and here and there are Chinese kongsis, from all of which at the break of day boats issue to prosecute the fishing close inshore. They use nets of every shape and size almost entirely, and return about 10 o'clock, commonly with good catches, which they dispose of at something like three cents per lb., and what is not bought for immediate consumption is salted and dried in the sun. The Chinamen living in those kongsis on the beach are engaged in catching prawns, which they do by dredging a very fine meshed net along the sands, for the production of \"blachang.\" At night, too, one can see torches flitting about on the water, the fisherman spearing the fish that are attracted to the light. In the streams one comes across dams in which are set all sorts of ingenious bamboo traps for fish.\n\nMeans of Communication.\n\nThe sea is the highway between these provincial towns and Bangkok the capital. Some twenty years ago Chinese junks and large boats of Siamese build crowded the Menam at Bangkok bringing in the produce from the coasts all round the gulf and carrying back products of civilization in return, but now, although two or three are always riding at anchor in the river at every village and town, they have been almost completely supplanted by small steamers flying at their stern the white elephant, having long since passed that condition of evidence required to carry the Union Jack.\n\nOn land, the towns and villages lying along the coast are connected by a path often winding along the beach, always rough and uneven, wending its way across morasses and soft miry paddy-fields, full of holes, crossing streams with neither bridge nor ford, so that it is laborious travelling indeed, and in the three southern Provinces fit for elephants only. Elephants abound in these Provinces and are used for transport, but in Koowi, where an elephant cannot be found, the roads are much better, being well adapted for buffalo drays, which are the sole means of transport.\nFour years ago a telegraph line from Bangkok was carried through these provinces, and a station was opened at Bangtaphan, but so frequently was the wire broken and instruments out of order, that it was seldom of any practical use. Already there is scarcely a sound pole, and certainly not a perpendicular one, and in many places the wire has forsaken the insulators and takes its support directly from the ground.\n\n**Location of Towns and Villages.**\n\nDacoity, or rather midnight robbery, is so rife in the district that the people, afraid to live in isolated and remote houses, congregate in towns and villages. These, surrounded by their paddy-fields, are situated upon the banks of a stream just so far from the mouth as a junk or big Siamese boat can reach at high water. In a small stream as that of Krat, the village is but a quarter of a mile from the sea; Bangtaphan, which stands upon a much larger stream, is two miles up the river, while Champoon, upon a much larger stream still, is nearly ten miles from the sea. The town occupying such a situation has the advantages of an ample supply of fresh water except at full tide, easy access to the sea for trade and fishing, and still in the midst of its paddy-fields. At the mouth of the river is commonly a small fishing hamlet known as the *l'aknam*, but which as in Taiyang, at the mouth of the Champoon River, may wax bigger than the principal town situated higher up the river. The village of Paron upon the concession of \"The Gold Fields of Siam Company,\" is a product of the mining industry there and is the only exception I know of in these provinces to the general situation upon the flat alluvial soil near the mouth of a river.\n\n**Composition of a Village or Town.**\n\nThese villages or towns resemble each other as much as peas do; they agree in being an irregular row of bamboo houses covered with attaps, raised upon posts some five feet above the ground and usually about one hundred of them huddled upon one or both banks of the stream. Gardens surround the houses usually containing chilies, papaya trees,\ncotton plants, and other vegetables, while round about are numerous groves of coco-nut and betel-net palms, plantains and jack fruit trees. A house rather larger than the others, but quite as dilapidated, proclaims the residence of the Governor, and an open shed near his Excellency's house serves as a court of justice by day and a sala or rest-house by night. At a little distance from the village, commonly in the healthiest and prettiest situation, always shaded by trees, stands the wat or pagoda, the centre of education and religion and which shelters a yellow-robed priest to every forty inhabitants in the town. Five or six houses of rather large dimensions, but, unlike all the other houses, not raised on posts, with numerous pigs feeding in front of them and with the doors pasted over with red posters, are the shops of the village, invariably owned and conducted by the Chinese. Here are sold dyes and calico prints, Manchester and Birmingham goods of very inferior quality, while buffalo hides and horns, dried fish, coco-nuts and betel-nuts are bought or exchanged. The opium farm, the gambling farm, and the spirit farm are always in the hands of the Chinese, and while waiting sometimes in the \"grog-shop\" I have been surprised to see men and women come straggling in, tendering their two cents and tossing off their arrack much as one sees in England.\n\nThe Inhabitants.\n\nSettling down at one of those villages, and taking a random hundred of the inhabitants, one would find them something like this:\u20146 Chinamen wedded to 6 Siamese women and having 13 children between them; 16 would be found Siamese-Chinese of a former generation. Of pure Siamese 10 men have wedded 10 Siamese women and 18 children have been the outcome, while 11 would be unmarried Siamese\u2014male and female. Forty-one per cent. is a low estimate of the proportion of Chinese and Chinese descendants that still wear a queue, for in some towns such as Taiyong they constitute more than 70% of the population. Into the numerous villages lying along the 3,000 miles of coast between\nRangoon and Tonquin, Chinamen have been continually dropping for centuries, mixing and marrying with the natives, so that the wonder is not that they have affected the race along the shore, but that they have not affected it more. The children of a Chinese-Siamese marriage\u2014unlike the weaklings produced by such a wide divergence as the Siamese and European\u2014are robust, of larger stature, and more muscular than the native, comparatively dark in complexion, and wanting the business smartness and mental activity of the father, as well as lacking that peculiar mental subtlety commonly found in the Siamese. Very curious to state, while the female offspring of a Chinese-Burmese marriage is as a rule of very prepossessing appearance, yet her Siamese cousin is invariably very ugly. The Chinese-Siamese is often a man of great ability, as can be seen by the large numbers that have raised themselves to affluence by trade, and in the last century, when the Burmese had overrun Siam and were grinding her down, one Phaya Fak (a Chinese-Siamese) arose, rallied his countrymen round him, led them from victory to victory, until Siam was again free. Those that know the dallying nature of the Siamese must recognize the Herculean task this man performed.\n\nEach of these provinces has its Governor appointed by the King, that of Champoon occupying the highest rank, but without exception they are greedy, ignorant, narrow-minded men, who hate the foreigner, his trade and his habits. They form a marked contrast to the discreet Chinamen that preside over the destinies of the provinces lying South of these, who in every way offer inducements to the capitalist to invest and open out the resources of the country, either agricultural or mining. But these old Siamese Governors are conservative of all their rights, and desire nothing more urgently than to keep the bustle and activity of civilization as far away as possible, and to be allowed to tread their own way, and I, for one, do not blame them.\n\nWhat the future of those provinces may be, I cannot say; no doubt they contain much latent mineral and agricultural wealth, but as long as the Siamese labourer can gain his\npound of rice for $2\\frac{1}{2}$ cents and his pound of fish at the same rate, he will wait a long time ere he will sweat himself to uncover their wealth. Besides the struggle of the native of these provinces is not for bread, it is for health, the high mortality leaving those that survive room enough and to spare to make an ample living.\nTHE ALLEGED DISCOVERY OF MERCURY IN MALACCA.\n\nBY\n\nDr. W. Bott, F.C.S. F.G.C.S., F.P.S., &c.\n\nIn November last year, I was informed that a quantity of mercury had been discovered during excavations on St. Paul's Hill, Malacca, on the site of the new water reservoir for the town. The discovery, I believe, produced some little excitement at the time and may, in certain quarters, even have conjured up pleasant visions of a new-born revenue of Malacca from a rich mercury mine. Now the existence of such a treasure would doubtless have resulted in a transfer of the proposed reservoir to a new place and the giving up of the venerable hill of St. Paul to the rude attacks of the pick and spade of the miner, and, as the work of excavation was then progressing, and the very spot of the discovery was about to be covered up, it seemed desirable to enquire into the matter without delay. In due course, I received two large bags of the supposed ore\u2014one from the exact place where the mercury had been collected, the other from the immediate vicinity. Both samples consisted of bright red earth, and the colour might or might not have been due to cinnabar (Sulphide of Mercury) as far as mere appearance went. On closer examination, visible globules of metallic mercury were found throughout the whole of the first sample, while the second contained none. Unfortunately the character of the soil in which the mercury was found, did not accord with its occurrence, for further examination shewed that the colour of the soil was entirely due to red, argillaceous ferric hydroxide, and that besides\nmetallic mercury it contained no combined mercury, no cinnabar, or in fact a sulphide of any kind. Now the presence of mercury in such a matrix of laterite pure and simple is a mineralogical impossibility, and my first attempt to solve the problem was by sharply questioning the Laboratory Steward whether he had lately spilled any mercury about the place. This led to indignant protests and no result, and thus there was left but one possible hope of explanation, viz., the existence of a cinnabar vein in St. Paul's Hill, from which the mercury had been derived, although it seemed strange that none of the cinnabar had found its way into the sample with it. A report was sent to the effect that the mercury was there, that it had no business to be there, and its presence could only be accounted for by a somewhat improbable hypothesis. At the instance of the Acting Resident Councillor, I was then asked to visit the place in person, but was unable to do so until the end of January, when I found a great part of the site covered up with brickwork. No difficulty was, however, experienced in ascertaining the nature of the entire formation, and proving the absence of a cinnabar vein and of sulphides generally. The existence of metallic mercury, however, was confirmed; appreciable quantities of it were found in several places, in fact 2 oz. were collected in about ten minutes. Having proved that this metal could not primarily have been present in the soil, it follows that it must have found its way into it by accident, and this opens up an unlimited field for speculation, unfortunately, however, without the redeeming feature of being able to tell the correct guess from the rest.\n\nAs several pounds of the metal had been obtained with little trouble in one place, and more might have been collected in other parts, it is evident, that a considerable quantity of mercury must, at one time or another, have been placed into the ground intentionally or accidentally; this suggests the following possibilities and new questions:\n\n1. The metal was intentionally poured into the ground. It is hard to conceive a reason for this; \"salting\" mercury mines would be a new idea entirely.\n2. The metal was hidden in the ground. This is possible, and may have been done for an unlimited number of reasons, but then suitable vessels would have been used, and no trace of such has been unearthed.\n\n3. The mercury was spilled by accident. This too is possible; it must have been a pretty big and expensive spill, and the operator does not seem to have tried very hard to pick up the precious fluid.\n\n4. Who buried or spilled the mercury? There is no record of mercury being stored on St. Paul's Hill during recent years; the Dutch or Portuguese may, therefore, have been the guilty party.\n\n5. What was the mercury intended for? Gold-mining?\n\n6. Why was it buried in the ground if we discard the spilling theory?\n\nThe above and a legion more questions and conjectures environ the mercurial puzzle of St. Paul's Hill, Malacca. Whether any light will ever be thrown upon the dark problem of the bright metal, whether one of the many contributors of this Journal familiar with side issues and odd details of Malacca history will be able to produce facts bearing upon the matter, remains to be seen. Until then, to Malacca will belong the credit of an inexplicable conjuring trick in the mineral line, unless the reader traces the mercury back to spiritualistic agencies, or concludes, with Topsy, that it \"growed.\"\n\nW. BOTT.\n\nNote.\u2014Since writing the above I have found the possible explanation of the discovery of mercury in St. Paul's Hill. Cameron in his book \"Malayan India,\" chapter XIII, states, that about 1864 Captain Playfair discovered at the base of the hill an old cellar or store-room which had formed part of the old Portuguese Government buildings. In it\u2014in a small recess\u2014were found forty or fifty earthenware pots mostly crumbled to pieces, but each of those which were whole contained a small quantity of mercury. Only about four pounds\naltogether were collected, but had the pots been full, as they probably were when first stowed away, they must have contained more than a ton of mercury. The metal had been brought there in connection with gold-mining on Mount Ophir. As only a small quantity of the metal was recovered in 1864 and recently, a ton or so of the metal, representing a value of about $2,000 would still remain buried in St. Paul's Hill. It remains, however, still to be proved that the mercury recently found is part of that formerly discovered by PLAYFAIR. The latter distinctly states that the mercury was discovered at the base of the hill, whereas the recent finds were made some distance above the base. It is difficult to conceive that this mercury should have worked its way up the hill, and it is more likely to be traced to another hiding place or store-room made on a higher level.\n\nW. BOTT.\nA NOTE ON RENGAS POISONING.\n\nBY\n\nW. C. BROWN, M.D.\n\nThe commonest of the various species of Rengas is *Melanorrhoea Curtisii Oliv.*, a tall and handsomely foliaged jungle tree which flourishes luxuriantly on many of the hill slopes of the Malay Peninsula, and extends northwards as far as the Southern Provinces of Burma. All the trees of this family contain in abundance an acrid sap, which is well known to native woodmen as a substance that, coming in contact with the skin, produces disagreeable and even dangerous results.\n\nIf the healthy skin is rubbed lightly with the juice from a freshly cut twig, violent inflammation, with smarting and burning pain, follows within twenty-four hours, and results in a characteristic pustular eruption\u2014an eruption of blebs filled with matter. If the injured surface be of any extent, fever and other constitutional disturbances follow the local injury. When a large extent of skin has been affected, as happens when a native with unprotected body struggles through broken branches, this fever is said to be so irritant and septic that it not infrequently ends fatally. I have not, however, seen a case of such gravity, but from the peculiarly severe symptoms produced by the sap on a small surface there can be little doubt but that where a large extent of skin is involved, the consequences might be most serious. An extract or tincture of the twigs made by soaking them in proof spirit has active blistering properties, and might be of value in medicine as a counter-irritant, did we not possess in croton oil and tartarated antimony remedies\nwhose action in producing a pustular eruption is identical with Rengas sap, and which have the additional advantage that their constitutional action is never dangerous. Internally, the juice acts as a violent irritant, causing vomiting and purging, and its administration is in the highest degree dangerous.\n\nMalays assert that simple contact with the leaves or unbroken branches is sufficient to give rise to equally evil effects, but experiment points to the fact that it is the sap of the tree that possesses the noxious qualities, and that simple contact with unbroken twigs is not usually hurtful. It is a matter of some importance, however, to note that the wood of the Rengas tree, which, being closely grained and capable of taking a high polish, would otherwise be of great value for cabinet-making, retains its irritant properties long after the sap has apparently dried. I am informed by Messrs. Knight & Co. of Singapore that, after years of seasoning, when the wood is cut up it gives rise to painful and intractable eruptions on the hands and bodies of the workmen, and that, for this reason alone, its value as an economic wood is seriously impaired.\n\nThe immediate treatment of the poison is generally successful; it should be to wrap the injured part in bandages with some dry alkaline powder, such as bicarbonate of soda, the object being to counteract the acid of the poison, and to absorb the exuded secretion from the skin. Vaseline or lard smeared on the hands and bodies of the woodcutters prevents the sap from setting up inflammation by affording a protective covering to the skin. Many cases, however, especially those that have been neglected, are refractory to treatment of any sort, and the ulcers that form between the fingers and toes as a result of Rengas poison are extremely untractable and sluggish in taking on a healthy and healing action; the eruption in emaciated and unhealthy subjects being very apt to develop into a condition of chronic ulceration.\n\nIf we pass from the region of observed fact to the more dubious realm of Malay belief and narrative, we are told that when a Rengas tree is felled, the exhalations from the cut\nstem are so noxious that on the woodmen inhaling them, their faces become swollen as if they had been stung by hornets, and that, although none of the sap has touched the skin, fever and blindness are usual consequences. It is impossible to accept these statements, but it is quite possible that some inflammation of the outer membrane of the eyes might be caused by the irritating vapour of Rengas sap.\n\nWith such distinctive characteristics as these, it is not surprising to find that Malays have invested the Rengas tree with supernatural properties. Before they venture to fell the tree to obtain the highly prized tiangs of this wood, elaborate exorcisms have to be undertaken to counteract the influences of evil-disposed djins and langsuyar. It is a matter of popular belief that, if the incantations are efficiently performed, the woodcutter is rendered proof against the poison of the sap; and three Malays living at Ayer Etam in Penang are believed to be such adepts in the art that their bodies have become impervious to the influence of the juice. I have experienced great difficulty in getting other natives to collect branches, as they insist that it is essential to have someone to do it who thoroughly understands the spells proper for the occasion. On investigation, it was found that all that these Malays claimed to achieve by their incantations was to attain exemption from the effects of the noxious vapour of the cut trees, and that they are careful to augment the protective powers of their spells by rubbing their hands and bodies with coco-nut oil.\n\nThe various species of the Rengas family must be frequently met with in the Peninsula in clearing jungle for plantations or railways, and it is obviously a matter of importance to be able to indentify trees that may expose workmen to serious danger.\n\nPenang, 29th October, 1891.\nA NEW COLLECTION OF MALAY PROVERBS.\n\nANY of the following Proverbs have been known to me for a considerable period, but though familiar with their use in colloquial Malay, I never reduced them to writing until lately when, travelling in the interior of Pahang, I was driven to do so for the sake of the occupation. At the same time I considerably enlarged my original stock of hitherto unpublished Proverbs, and, to the best of my belief, the present collection contains no Proverb which has already appeared in print.\n\nThe Malay language is one which lends itself to that terseness of expression and felicity of diction which is so essential to an aphorism, and which is often the despair of the translator, who attempts to compress the meaning conveyed by a few pithy Malay words, into as many lines of English. The Malay Proverb is also interesting from a philological point of view, because in these old-time sayings many words are found which do not occur in any Malay writings, though such terms are, for the most part, common enough in the colloquial dialects.\n\nBy the Malay, who is conservative to the backbone, and a laudator temporis acti by nature and education, all the wisdom of the ancients (per-kata-an orang tua-tua) whether preserved in Proverb, Charm, or Precept, is accepted with perfect faith as incontrovertible truth. As a race, too, the Ma-\nlays delight in obscure hints and darksome metaphors. An educated Malay will ask for his neighbour's daughter in marriage to his son in a letter which is simply a string of doubles entendres, and in familiar colloquial discourse a native will quote the first line of a verse (which in its entirety contains four lines, the first two of which are wholly irrelevant and are only introduced for the sake of rhyming with the two last lines), leaving his bewildered hearer to infer his meaning from a knowledge of the lines which form the rest of the verse, the first line of which has been given. In discussions among Malays, too, it is the man who can quote, and not he who can reason, that bears away the palm. I need hardly add that a Proverb which is both ancient and obscurely metaphorical, is immensely popular with all classes of Malays.\n\nIn preparing these Proverbs for the press, I have endeavoured to combine, as far as possible, an absolutely literal translation with a correct rendering into English of the Malay meaning.\n\nThe Proverbs are arranged in order according to the sequence of the Malay alphabet.\n\nHUGH CLIFFORD.\n1\nAda-kah hilang bisa ular meny-usop di-bawah akar.\n\nWill a snake lose its venom through creeping under a root? i.e., will a Chief lose his rank through being civil to his inferiors?\n\n2\nAsal angkau tugal ada-lah benis.\n\nIf you make holes in the ground, seed shall be forthcoming. Used to signify that if an offence is committed retaliation will follow.\n\n*Tugal* = the holes in the ground prepared for the reception of seed; to sew seed in holes prepared for it; to make holes in the ground for the reception of seed.\n\nFavre renders this word \"Culture du riz dans des terres \u00e9lev\u00e9es et s\u00e8ches,\" but omits to mention the particular manner of planting to which alone this word (so far as my experience goes) is applied.\n\n3\nAnggok bukan g\u00e9ling ya.\n\nNot a nod but a shake of the head.\n\nTo feign a desire for one thing while really desiring something different.\n\n4\nAntan patah lesong hilang.\n\nIf the pestle be broken, the mortar will be lost.\n\nIf the husband be impotent, the wife will prove unfaithful.\nAnjing galak babi brani.\n\nThe dogs are ferocious and the pigs are daring\nUsed to signify that both sides are 'spoiling for a fight.'\n\nAnak baik menantu molek.\n\nA good son and a pretty daughter-in-law.\nUsed in speaking of people who are entirely of one mind.\n\nUlar bukan ikan pun bukan.\n\nNeither snake nor fish.\n'Neither fish, flesh, nor fowl, nor good red-herring.'\n\nIkan biar dapat serampang jangan pokah.\n\nLet the fish be caught, but let not the fish spear be bent.\nTo act with due discretion.\n\nCompare Prov. 27 in No. 11 of this Journal, and the two Proverbs with which Mr. MAXWELL there compares it. The familiar version of Prov. 27 with which I am best acquainted, runs as follows:\n\nUlar biar mati tanah jangan lekok buloh jangan patah.\n\nLet the snake die, but let not the ground be dented, nor the bamboo broken.\n\nPokah = to bend; to become bent; to be bent; to\nbe out of the straight; bent; crooked.\n\nThis term, though a common colloquial expression, is not, I believe, to be found in any Malay Dictionary now published.\n\n9\n\nIkan ter-kirap jala tiba.\n\nAs the fish shake themselves clear, the casting net arrives.\n\nToo late.\n\n10\n\nBatu kecil ber-guling naik, batu besar ber-guling turun.\n\nLittle stones roll up, and big stones roll down.\n\nThe end of all things, when the common people shall be greater than the nobles.\n\n11\n\nBatu hitam ta' ber-sanding.\n\nA black stone without projections.\n\nDifficult to injure.\n\n12\n\nBangau! Bangau! minta aku lehir. Badak! Badak! minta aku daging.\n\nOh stork! I beg from thee thy neck! Oh rhinoceros! I beg from thee thy flesh!\n\nCompare:\n\nProv. 64 of Mr. Maxwell's collection published in No. 2 of this Journal.\nDi-minta ka-pada iang ada.\n\nAsk from those who possess, &c.\n\nBagai anjing ter-sepit di-pagar.\n\nLike a dog squeezed in a fence.\n\nViz., Making a hideous clamour.\n\nThe form:\n\nBagai anjing ter-sepit ekor.\n\nLike a dog when its tail is squeezed.\n\nAnd also met with.\n\nBagai anjing me-lentang denai.\n\nLike a dog hunting wide.\n\n(Lit., crossing a jungle path.)\n\nDenai = a small foot-path in deep jungle. This word, though often met with in colloquial Malay, is not to be found in any Dictionary.\n\nBagai anjing meny-alak di-pantat gajah.\n\nLike a dog barking at an elephant\u2019s stern.\n\nImpotent rage.\nBagai anak dara mabok andam.\n\nLike a maiden overcome by the fringe upon her forehead.\nSelf-conscious; shy.\n\nAndam = the fringe of short hair cut upon the forehead of newly married girls, or girls who are about to be married. FAVRE mistranslates this word\u2014'Arranged, adjusted, &c.'\n\nBagai aur gantong ka-tebing, bagai tebing gantong ka-aur.\n\nLike a bamboo hanging from a river bank, and like a river bank depending from a bamboo.\nTo lean on a broken reed.\n\nBagai ayer titek ka-batu.\n\nLike water dripping on to a stone.\n\nBagai ikan kena tuba.\n\nLike a fish poisoned by the tuba (Derris elliptica) root.\nIn difficulties. 'Up a tree.'\nThe above Proverb is generally used with several others:\u2014\nBagai ikan kena tuba.\nUdang di-dalam tanggok.\nBagai ulat nangka ter-hempas ka-batu.\nBagai ruan di-dalam tuar.\nBagai anak sepat ka-tohor.\nBagai dekan di-bawah pangkal buloh.\n\nLike a fish poisoned with the *tuba* root.\nLike a prawn in a prawn-basket.\nLike jack-fruit grub dashed against a stone.\nLike a *ruan* fish in a rattan fish-trap.\nLike a little *sepat* fish in the shallows.\nLike the bamboo-rat under the roots of the bamboo.\n\n*Ruan* and *Sepat* are both small fish found in the *padi* swamps, and are usually caught by means of a *serkap*.\n\n*Tuar* = a fish-trap of a conical shape, made from the *onak* thorn, and so constructed that a fish can enter without difficulty, but cannot get out without being hooked by the thorns.\n\nBagai ayam di-makan tungau.\n\nLike a fowl devoured by parasites.\nPoorly; seedy-looking; in poor condition.\n\n*Tungau* = a small red parasite found on the sand-sprits which line the river-banks in the Peninsula.

The place mentioned is a group of islands at the mouth of the Perak River.\n\n23\n\nBagai toman makan anak.\n\nLike the toman fish which eats its own young.\nApplied to Chiefs who misuse their powers, oppressing those whom they are bound to protect.\nToman = a fresh water fish which attains a considerable size. Its colour is a reddish yellow, and its flesh is of a saffron hue. It subsists on other fish.\n\n24\n\nBagai rabok dengan api asal ber-dekat me-nyala-lah ia.\n\nLike tinder and fire, which if they come near one another burst into a blaze.\nApplied to people who are deadly enemies.\n\n25\nBagai pelandok di-dalam cherang.\n\nLike a mouse-deer in a clearing, i.e., stupid, bewildered, timid.\n\nCherang = a clearing; an opening in the forest made for planting purposes. This word is much used in the States on the Eastern slope of the Peninsula. It is probably derived from Trang light, open, clear, &c. The form ch\u00eb-rakn (a clearing) met with in the S\u00ebn-oi dialect of Sakai, has the appearance of being formed from the Malay word and not vice versa.\n\nBagai kra dapat changgong.\n\nLike an ape which has caught hold of a snag. Clinging like grim death; as a fool clings to bad advice.\n\nBagai klip-klip terbang malam.\n\nLike a fire-fly flying by night. Said of a supposed secret which is widely known.\n\nCompare:\n\nAyam puteh terbang malam.\n\nA white fowl flying by night, in Mr. Maxwell\u2019s collection of Malay Proverbs.\n\nBagai kuching dengan panggang.\n\nLike the cat with the roast. Impossible to keep apart. Said of the mutual attraction between young people of opposite sexes.\n29\n\nBagai galah di-tengah arus.\n\nLike a boat-pole in mid-stream, i.e., shaking from head to foot.\n\n30\n\nBagai ma\u2019 mandul bharu ber-anak.\n\nLike a hitherto barren woman who has just given birth to a child.\n\n\u201cAs pleased as Punch.\u201d\n\nCompare:\n\nBagai orang buta bharu chel\u00e9k.\n\nLike a blind man who has newly recovered his sight.\n\n31\n\nBagai men-arek rambut di-dalam tepong.\n\nLike pulling a hair out of flour.\n\n\u201cAs easy as lying.\u201d\n\n32\n\nBagai harimau ber-anak muda.\n\nLike a tiger with young cubs.\n\nIrritable; angry without provocation.\n\n33\n\nBaik puteh tulang jangan puteh mata.\n\nBetter white bones than white eyes.\nThis Proverb contains an idiom; *puteh mata* (white eyes) being a common Malay expression signifying \"ill-feeling,\" \"black blood,\" &c. The meaning of the above Proverb thus is, that it is better that a quarrel should come to a head, even though it ends in the death of one of the parties concerned, rather than that ill-feeling should exist endlessly.\n\n34\n\n*Be-ber-apa-kah tajam pisau parang tajam lagi mulut manusia.*\n\nHowever sharp is a knife or a chopper, sharper yet is the human tongue.\n\n35\n\n*Betul-betul ekor anjing kalau bagai-mana pun ada juga bengkok-nya.*\n\nHowever straight a dog's tail may be, it will still be crooked. A rogue will never be altogether honest.\n\n36\n\n*Bechara-kan rumput di-halaman orang di-halaman sendiri rumput sampai ka-kaki tangga.*\n\nTo take thought of the grass on one's neighbour's lawn while that on one's own house-plot spreads even unto the foot of the door-step.\n\nThe beam and the mote.\n\n37\n\n*Be-ber-apa pun anjing meny-alak bukit bulih-kah runtoh.*\nHowever much dogs may bark, will a hill fall to pieces? i.e., Does a man of assured position regard the slander of his inferiors?\n\nBer-telingkoh antan di-lesong ayam juga yang kennyang.\n\nWhen the pestles fall together into the mortar, the fowls have their bellies-full.\n\nWhen men of rank quarrel, the common people reap the benefit.\n\nTelingkoh \u062a\u0644\u064a\u06a0\u0643\u0648\u0647 = to collide; to clash. So far as I know this word is not to be found in any Malay Dictionary.\n\nBer-cherai tidak ber-talak ber-nikah tidak ber-kathi.\n\nDivorced without the ceremony of divorce, and married without the assistance of the clergy.\n\nSaid of the parents of a bastard.\n\nBri betis handak paha.\n\nGive the leg and the thigh is wanted.\n\n\"Give an inch they take an ell.\"\n\nCompare Proverb 99 in this collection.\n\nBelum tuarang panjang buah sengkuang s'besar betis.\n\nBefore a drought has lasted for a long time the sengkuang fruit are grown to be as big as the calf of one's leg.\n\nSaid when false reports are spread without any foundation for them.\nTuarang = a drought which is even of longer duration than the ordinary drought called Kamarau.\n\nSengkuang = the name of a creeping plant which has an edible root. The fruit is said only to grow large during very dry weather.\n\nBiar-biar naik ka-mata.\n\nIntestinal worms ascend even unto the eyes.\n\n\"Do not put off till to-morrow what may be done to-day.\"\n\nThis Proverb contains a play upon the words biar-biar (intestinal worms), and biar (to leave alone; to let be); but it is impossible to render this pun in an English translation. This Proverb is generally used in answer to any one who says Biar-lah dahulu \"let it be for the present;\" in reply to an order bidding him do anything.\n\nTa' bulih di-baik-i jangan di-pichah-kan.\n\nIf you cannot mend it, do not break it more.\n\nTa' sunggoh getah daun dengan s'benar getah batang juga.\n\nNot really resin from the leaf, but in truth resin from the trunk of the tree.\n\nSaid of one who has authority which is the result of the influence of some one greater than he, with whom he is connected.\nTanah lembah kandong-an ayer, kayu benzkok titi-an kra.\nLow-lying land holds water; a crooked bough is used by monkies as a bridge.\n\nThe rich prevail, the poor go to the wall.\n\nTa\u2019 usah-lah ajar anak buaya bernang, dia sudah pandai sedia.\nIt is not necessary to teach a young crocodile how to swim, as it is already expert.\n\n\u201cTo teach one\u2019s grandmother to suck eggs.\u201d\n\nCompare:\n\nItek di-ajar bernang.\nThe duck is taught to swim.\n\n(No. 77 of KLINKERT\u2019S Collection of Proverbs).\n\nTa\u2019usah bimbang gula di-dalam mulut bila handak telan telan.\nBe not solicitous concerning the sugar which is in your mouth, when you desire to swallow it, do so!\n\nDo not be anxious about trifling undertakings.\n\nTahan jerat surong kapala.\nSet a snare and thrust your head into it.\nApplied to those who through excess of cunning overreach themselves.\n\n49\n\n\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0633 \u062a\u0631\u0627\u0648\u0646\u062c\u0645 \u06af\u0648\u0628\u0627\u0644 \u0645\u0644\u0627\u064a\u062e\n\u0628\u0631\u062a\u06cc\u0646\u062a\u06cc\u063a \u0628\u0631\u062a\u0646\u0645\u06cc \u062a\u0631\u0627\u0633\n\u06af\u0648\u0628\u0627\u0644 \u0645\u0644\u0627\u064a\u062e \u062a\u0631\u0627\u0633 \u062a\u06cc\u063a\u06af\u0644\n\nTras ter-unjam gubal me-layang.\nBer-tinting ber-tampi tras.\nGubal me-layang tras tinggal.\n\nThe core of the tree is fixed firmly in the ground, and the light wood which surrounds it is blown away. When the core of the tree is sifted, the light wood is blown away, but the core of the tree remains.\n\nIf common people compete with nobles, they come to an evil end, while the nobles remain unharmed.\n\nUnjam \u0627\u0648\u0646\u062c\u0645 = to stick upright in the ground. This word is exactly similar in meaning to Chachak, \u0686\u0627\u0686\u0642.\n\n50\n\n\u062a\u0631\u0643\u0646\u0627 \u0641\u062f \u0627\u06cc\u06a9\u0646 \u0628\u0631\u0645\u0648\u0631\u0642\n\u062a\u0631\u0643\u0646\u0627 \u0641\u062f \u0628\u0627\u062b\u063a \u0645\u0627\u0633\u0645\n\nTer-kena pada ikan ber-sorak.\nTer-kena pada batang masam.\n\nTo shout with triumph if one strikes a fish, and to be cross if one strikes a log.\n\nUnduly elated by success and unduly depressed by adversity.\n\n51\n\n\u062c\u0627\u063a\u0646 \u062f\u0633\u063a\u06a9\u0627\u06a9\u0646 \u0627\u06cc\u06a9\u0646 \u0644\u0627\u064a\u0633 \u062a\u06cc\u062f\u06cc\u0642 \u0633\u06cc\u063a\u0633\u0639\nJangan di-sangka-kan ikan lais-lais tidak meny-engat.\nDo not fancy that the *lais-lais* fish will not sting.\n\n\"Despise not thy enemy.\"\n\n*Lais-lais* = a small fresh water fish which is armed with sharp stings in its fins.\n\n52\n\n*Jangan di-ajar anak harimau makan daging.*\n\nDo not teach a tiger cub to eat flesh.\n\nSaid to those who give bad advice to a young *Raja* or Chief who unassisted will learn evil ways quite quickly enough.\n\n53\n\n*Jikalau ber-anak ikut kata bidan.*\n\nIf thou art confined of a child, do as the midwife bids thee.\n\nFollow the advice of experts.\n\n54\n\n*Charek-charek bulu ayam lama-lama ia ber-chantum bula.*\n\nThough a fowl's feathers may be torn to tatters they will eventually grow again thickly.\n\nThough relatives may quarrel, they will eventually make friends again.\n\n*Chantum* is translated by Favre, \"Piqu\u00e9, piqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'aiguille,\" but that I believe to be only a secondary meaning, the term being principally used to express a thick growth of any kind.\n\nIn Pahang, *Chantum* in this Proverb is often replaced by *Tampun*, which has the same signification as Chan-\ntum, but is not as universally understood among the Malays of the Peninsula.\n\n55\n\n\u062f\u064e\u062a\u0648\u0628 \u0633\u0650\u0647\u0627\u062c\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u06cc\u06a9\u0646 \u062f\u062c\u0627\u0644 \u062c\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u063a \u0628\u0648\u06a9\u0646\u0647 \u0627\u06cc\u06a9\u0646\n\nDi-tuba sahaja-kah ikan di-jala jaring bukan-kah ikan.\n\nAre those alone fish which are poisoned with the tuba root?

Native tradition says that the name of the State of Pahang is derived from this word. The tiny brook which debouches at Kuala Tembeling and gives its name to the great stream formed by the Jelai and Tembeling Rivers, taking its source, it is said, at a spot where a giant mahang tree once stood.\n\n59\n\nDempit tidak ber-sanggit.\nDi-tambat tidak ber-tali.\n\nPressed together but not rubbing, tied without twine.\n\nSaid of persons who live together, but who are not bound by any real tie.\n\nSanggit = to rub against; to touch against anything. To come in contact, or to be in contact with anything.\n\nThe root, which is found in Dempit, is one which has retained its form and its meaning in a more marked degree than almost any other Malay root. This is exemplified by the following words:\n\nApit = to press, &c.\nKapit = to press, pressed, &c. (See Pulut kapit = pressed olenaceous rice.)\nKepit = to carry under the armpit, viz., pressed between the arm and the body.\nSepit = to squeeze, &c. (See Proverb 13 of this Collection.)\nHempit = to get close to anything; to press against it, &c.\nSempit = narrow, confined.\n\nSumpit or Kempit = a narrow rice bag (a place in which rice is confined).\n\nChubit = to pinch.\n\nThe word Apit has been traced to a Sanskrit root; but either the resemblance is a chance coincidence, or else this root which runs through so many common words in Malay is itself derived from Sanskrit, which would seem improbable.\n\nJangan di-sesal gunong ber-lari, hilang kabut tampak-lah dia.\n\nFret not through fear that a mountain will run away, when the mist clears it will be still in view.\n\nDo not be anxious about remote contingencies.\n\nSama kain basah s'hele timah s'suku, kalau ta' timah pergi s'rasa men-dapat.\n\nA bathing cloth and a suku of money are of equal value.\n\nIf only one did not pay the money away, one would feel as though one had gained by the bargain.\n\nSaid of one who wishes to \"have his cake and eat it too.\"\n\nSeperti anjing dapat pasir.\n\nLike a dog on a sand-bank.\n\nRunning heedlessly hither and thither through sheer rude health and robust spirits.\nSeperti dedalu api hingga ka-pohun kayu.\nHingga ka-ibu ibu-nya mati.\nHingga ka-ranting ranting-nya patah.\n\nLike a spark of fire falling upon a tree.\nIf it falls upon the trunk the trunk will die.\nIf it falls upon a branch the branch will be broken.\n\n\"Evil communication corrupts good manners.\"\n\nSeperti orang mati jikalau tiada orang meng-angkat bila-kah ber-grak.\n\nLike a dead man. If no one lifts him up, when will he be able to move?\nHelpless.

The Bar-mecide's feast.\n\n69\n\nSeperti pisau raut bengkok orang bulih betul bengkok kita ta' bulih betul.\n\nLike a (bent) knife used for scraping rotan. The twists in others can be made straight, but one's own kinks can never be straightened.\n\nApplied to himself by one who considers that his offences are more severely punished than the offences committed by others.\n\n\"One man may steal a horse, and another may not look over the fence.\"\n\nA pisau raut has a slightly curved blade which is about the size of an ordinary razor. This blade is attached to a handle, which is usually double or treble the length of the blade.

To condescend to.\n\nIn his collection of Malay Proverbs (Prov. 272) printed in No. 3 of this Journal, Mr. MAXWELL gives this word as Sior which, however, is only the local pronunciation of the word in the Perak dialect, where a final \u064a\u0631 ir is always rendered ior in the colloquial pronunciation, e.g., Kikir \u0643\u06cc\u06a9\u06cc\u0631, a file, is pronounced Kikior in the Perak dialect. This word is in common colloquial use in Perak, Pahang, Kelantan, Trengganu and Patani. Another word Sualak \u0633\u0648\u0627\u0644\u0642, which is not included in lists of words yet published, is also frequently met with in the colloquial dialects, especially in Perak. Mr. MAXWELL states that Sir is identical in meaning with Ingin \u0627\u06cc\u0646\u06af\u06cc\u0646, but in the negative form Ta'sir, and Ta'sualak also, are perhaps better rendered into polite Malay by the phrase Ta'sudi \u062a\u0627\u064b\u0633\u0648\u062f\u06cc.\n\nDegap \u062f\u06af\u0641 which is also a slang word not found in any Dictionary, signifies 'thoroughly, altogether,' &c. Kena degap \u06a9\u0646\u0627 \u062f\u06af\u0641 has much the same signification as Kena tepat \u06a9\u0646\u0627 \u062a\u0641\u06cc\u062a to be hit full, to be hit fair.\n\nKalau gajah handak pandang gading-nya.\n\nKalau harimau handak pandang blang-nya.\n\nIf an elephant, he wants to examine its tusks.

Favre would seem to have missed the meaning of this latter word in this connection, as he translates it 'Pile, monceau, tas, amas, '\u00eatre en pile, en groupe' and renders *pie* (piebald) by *plang* \u0628\u0644\u063a, which is merely a corrupted form of *blang* \u0628\u0644\u063a.\n\n---\n\n85\n\n\u0643\u0627\u0644\u0647 \u0645\u0646\u063a \u062a\u0627\u064b\u062a\u0627\u0647\u0648 \u0628\u0631\u0645\u0633\u0648\u0631\u0642 \u0628\u0648\u0644\u0647\n\n*Kalah menang ta'tahu ber-sorak bulih.*\n\nWe know not whether we shall win or lose, but anyhow we can shout!\n\nSaid by those who anticipate a victory.\n\n---\n\n86\n\n\u0643\u0686\u06cc\u0644 \u062a\u0627\u064b\u0628\u0648\u0644\u0647 \u062f\u0633\u06a0\u0643\u0627\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0646\u0642\n\u0628\u0633\u0631 \u062a\u0627\u064b\u0628\u0648\u0644\u0647 \u062f\u0633\u06a0\u0643\u0627\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0641\n\n*Kechil ta'bulih di-sangka-kan anak.*\n*Besar ta'bulih di-sangka-kan bapa.*\n\nSmall beasts should not be accounted young, nor large beasts be accounted parents.\n\nDo not judge by appearances.\n\n---\n\n87\n\n\u0643\u0633\u064a\u0647\u0646\u0643\u0646 \u0631\u0627\u062c \u062f\u0627\u062a\u0633 \u0627\u0648\u0633\u0648\u063a\n\n*Kasih-an-kan raja di-atas usong.*\n\nTo feel pity for a prince upon his litter.\n\nMisplaced pity.\nKapala sama hitam hati masing-masing.\n\nOur heads alike are black, but our hearts are different in each one of us.\n\nKumbang ta\u2019s\u2019ekor, bunga ta\u2019s\u2019kaki.\n\nThere is not only one beetle, and but a single flower.\n\n\u201cThere are as good fish in the sea as ever came out of it.\u201d\n\nKita bharu chapai peng-ayuh orang sudah tiba ka-sebrang.\n\nWe have just taken up our paddles when others have already crossed the stream.\n\nSaid of one who is too late.\n\n\u201cTo be asked for the wedding and arrive for the christening.\u201d\n\nKita samoa mati tetapi kubor masing-masing.\n\nWe all alike die, but our graves are separate.\n\nMen\u2019s lots are divided.\nK\u00e9chek anak Malaka.\nBual anak Menangkabau.\nTipu anak Rembau.\nBida\u00e4h anak Trengganu.\nSombong anak Pahang.\n\nThe men of Malacca wheedle; the men of Menangkabau draw the long bow; the men of Rembau cheat; the men of Trengganu lie; and arrogant are the men of Pahang!\n\nThe above proverbial saying hits off the most prominent characteristic of each nation of Malays mentioned.\n\n93\n\nKurang krat rengkoh yang lebeh.\n\nThe less we sever by cutting the more we break by pulling and twisting.\n\nWe cannot shirk our responsibilities, and if we put them aside in one form they will start up afresh in another.\n\nRengkoh = to break by pulling, twisting or bending.

Putri Gandar\u00ed\u00e1 lives on Mount Ophir, but she often visits other territories, such as the watershed of the Gemencheh River.\n\nShe is seen by mankind under the following circumstances. Boatmen going down the stream will see a very ugly old woman on the bank. She has with her a cat, and slung over her shoulder is a small bag containing saffron.\n\nThe old woman shouts to the boatmen to stop and take her with them down stream. The boatmen seeing that she is old and ugly take no notice of her. In a moment the boat grounds on a sand-bank and the boatmen cannot get off again.\n\nThe old woman then cries \"Let me get into the boat and all will be well.\" The boatmen agree, and the old woman gets into the boat. No sooner has she got in than the boat glides off down stream. They travel together for some time when the old woman says she wishes to land. The boatmen draw up to the bank and she lands, at the same time giving them each a piece of the saffron from her bag, which the instant it touches their hands turns into gold. At the same time the ugly old woman and her cat disappear.\n\nThis is how Putri Gandar\u00ed\u00e1 is seen by men, and to meet her does not forbode misfortune, but on the contrary is the signal of rare good luck.\n\nShe can transform her cat into a tiger, and people are afraid to hunt her out and molest her. The tradition is that if she is sought for or disturbed, she will certainly order her cat to assume the shape of a tiger, who will avenge her by devouring such obtrusive persons. Putri Gandar\u00ed\u00e1 does not live on the very summit of Gunong L\u00e9dang. I never heard of any one living there.\nIn Monsieur L\u00e9on Jausset's translation of Godinho de Eredia's \"Account of Malacca,\" the Putri of Gunong L\u00e9dang is mentioned:\n\n\"Gunoledam, where lived the Enchantress 'Putry Raynha' a female Magician who in like manner to the Sorceress Erichtho the Thessalonian transformed, by virtue of certain plants, women into tigers, into birds or into other kinds of animals.\" And again:\n\n\"According to a fable common amongst the Malays, the Queen Putri, wife of Permicuri, the founder of Malacca, retired to the mountain and she lives there still having become immortal by means of magic art. Her dwelling place is on the summit of the mountain in a cavern, where she reclines on a couch formed of the bones of the dead and she shows herself in the shape of a beautiful young girl dressed in silk.\"\n\nThe Dato' of Johol's version is probably the aboriginal version representing the Putri as an ugly old woman with a cat. Godinho de Eredia's version is the civilized Malay version treating the lady as young and beautiful and dressed in silk in accordance probably with the ideas in similar Arabic stories.\n\nM. L.\n\nDIAMONDS IN THE MALAY PENINSULA.\n\nGarcia da Orta in his Aromatium Historia, Lib. I, p. 171, treating of diamonds says:\u2014\"Alia est rupes ad fretum Tanjam in Malac\u00e6 tractu, qu\u00e6 etiam de Rupe veteri cognominatos profert. Exigui quidem sunt sed laudati: unum tamen habent vitium quod ponderosi sint, quo nomine gratiores sunt venditoribus quam emptoribus.\"\n\n\"There is another rock at the Strait of Tenjam in the territory of Malacca, which produces [diamonds] of the class called old-rock diamond. They are few but valuable; however they have one fault, that they are heavy, therefore they are more valued by the sellers than the buyers.\"\nWe have not any record of late of the discovery of diamonds in the Peninsula, but where is the Strait of Tanjam? Is it a perversion of Tanjong, and if so which Cape is it?\n\nH. N. R.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF A NEW SPECIES OF JUNGLE FOWL, SAID TO COME FROM BORNEO.\n\nThe specimen from which this description is taken was in confinement in the Botanic Gardens, Singapore, and was obtained in 1890 from a Malay dealer who had two of them (both males) for sale, and who said they came from Borneo. I have named this species *Gallus violaceus* on account of the conspicuous violet gloss of the hackles and tail feathers, which is the most distinguishing feature of the bird. This beautiful jungle fowl resembles *Gallus varius* of Java in having only a single throat wattle and in the hackles being round ended instead of lance shaped as in the other members of the genus. It however differs from *G. varius* in having a serrated comb, and in its colouring.\n\n**Description of Adult Male.**\n\nComb large and serrated. Throat wattle single. A yellowish patch edged with purplish blue at each side of throat wattle. Neck hackles rounded at the ends, not lance shaped, and of a beautiful metallic violaceous purple, each feather very narrowly edged with black. Lower feathers of the neck shot with metallic green. Wings.\u2014Primaries black slightly glossed with invisible green. Secondaries black, broadly edged with dull chestnut on the outer webs. Greater wing coverts black, glossed with invisible green, the uppermost row broadly edged on both webs with deep red brown, those of the secondaries slightly edged outwardly with chestnut. Median coverts and scapularies bright chestnut shaded with black. Lesser coverts dark green edged with black and some of the feathers glossed with metallic purple. Feathers of the back\nand rump bright golden chestnut broadly shaded with metallic purple and black. Tail black glossed with metallic purple, metallic green at base. Under tail-coverts olive black glossed with metallic green and purple. Feathers of the throat black streaked with chestnut. Abdomen blackish slightly glossed with purple. Feathers of and vent black tipped with chestnut. Under side of wings dark brown with a silvery sheen. Irides yellow ochre. Bill light brown, darker at base. Legs pinkish white. Claws whitish.\n\nIn the specimen described, there are one or two irregular white blotches on the quills of the wings.\n\nTotal length (living bird) about 28 inches. Wing 9 inches. Bill from gape 1.0 inch. Tarsus 3.5 inches.\n\nH. J. KELSALL.\n\nA LARGE MIAS IN SINGAPORE.\n\nThere was in Singapore in November last one of the largest, if not the largest, Mias that has ever been captured. It was a male and probably of the species known as *Simia satyrus*, Linn., or the Mias Pappan of the Dyaks. He was captured in Borneo, and bought by a native dealer in Singapore, who eventually sold him to a German ship's captain, by whom he has been, it is believed, taken to Germany.\n\nAs far as I could judge, his height must have been close on 4 feet 5 inches. The cage in which he was confined was 4 feet 2 inches or thereabouts in height, and he could easily touch the top of it with his head without standing erect. His face was immensely broad, the cheeks being flattened out sideways into a sort of disc. The hair was long (about 4 inches) and thick and of a bright red colour and he had a distinct short pointed beard. The eyes dark brown.\n\n*Wallace* in the *Malay Archipelago*, chap. 4, discusses the size of the Mias at some length, and concludes by saying \"on the whole, therefore, I think it will be allowed that up to this\ntime we have not the least reliable evidence of the existence of Orangs in Borneo more than 4 feet 2 inches high.\" This specimen, however, was distinctly bigger than this.\n\nThe method said to have been adopted by the natives in catching this huge animal was ingenious. They pounded up a quantity of chillies into a paste, of which they made pellets. These pellets they blew by means of their sumpitans into the eyes of the unfortunate Mias, or Orang Utan, who rubbed its eyes to try and ease the pain, and thus made them worse and soon became quite blinded for the time being, and was of course in frightful agony. The natives then proceeded to cut down the tree in which the wretched beast was, and when it was on the ground, not knowing which way to turn from its tormentors, they seized it by the neck by means of two long poles fastened together like a gigantic pair of scissors, and thus placed it in the cage prepared for it, which was then firmly closed.\n\nH. J. K.\n\nNOTE ON THE NEST AND EGGS OF NYCTIORNIS AMICTA.\n\nOn the 22nd August, 1891, when walking along a jungle track close to the limestone cave at Kota Glanggi (near Pulau Tawar, Pahang) a Malay who was just a short distance in front of me collecting plants for Mr. RIDLEY, called my attention to a hole in the ground, which he said was a \"Sarang Burong,\" or bird's nest, and he said he was sure there were eggs in it, as he had seen a green bird about the size of a ground dove (Chalcophaps indica) come out of it. The hole was close to the path and in the side of a slight mound. The mouth was just large enough for me to get my hand into, and oval in shape. I could not reach the end of the tunnel, so I made the Malay cut away the ground, following the tunnel, and when he had got about 30 inches from the mouth he took out two white almost globular eggs. There\nappeared to be no nest proper, the eggs being simply laid at the end of the tunnel, which was nowhere more than 6 or 8 inches below ground and as nearly as possible horizontal. Mr. Davison, to whom I gave the eggs as soon as I got to camp, identified them as those of a bee-eater and undoubtedly of *Nyctiornis amicta*.\n\nThe dimensions of the eggs are as follows:\n\n1.25 \u00d7 1.15 inches.\n1.22 \u00d7 1.10 inches.\n\nThe eggs are now in the Singapore Museum.\n\nH. J. K.\n\n---\n\n**NEST AND EGGS OF HENICURUS RUFICAPILLUS, TEMM.**\n\nOn the 23rd July, 1891, while out collecting in the neighbourhood of our camp at Kuala Tahan (Pahang Ulu) and looking out for birds up a small streamlet flowing through the thick jungle, I found a nest of *Henicurus ruficapillus* with three eggs in it. The hen bird was sitting on the nest, and flew off on my approach. I did not get a shot at her. The nest, which is shallow, cup-shaped, and 6 or 7 inches in diameter, is made entirely of moss and lined with the skeletons of leaves. It was built on to the side of an almost perpendicular rock, very much after the fashion of that of the water ouzel. Nest and eggs are now in the Singapore Museum.\n\nThe eggs are white spotted and blotched with light red and pale purplish red, the spots being larger and concentrated into a ring round the larger end. One egg was broken while blowing, the dimensions of the other two are as follows:\n\n0.97 \u00d7 0.66 inches.\n0.90 \u00d7 0.68 inches.\n\nH. J. K.\n\n---\n\n**ON THE OCCURRENCE OF PETROSAVIA IN PERAK.**\n\nDuring a short trip to Perak in February last, I collected a quantity of a small yellow saprophytic plant growing sporadically among the vegetation along the banks of the road\nfrom the tea-gardens to Maxwell's Hill, and also on the Hermitage Hill. On examining it at leisure, I found it to agree very well with the description of a rare plant known as *Petrosavia stellata*, Becc., described and figured in the *Nuove Giornale Botanico Italiano*, iii 7, t. 1. Beccari collected his specimens in Borneo, on Mount Poe, near Sarawak, at 3,000 feet altitude, and, as far as I am aware, it has not been collected there since, and it has not hitherto been recorded from the Malay Peninsula. It, therefore, forms another addition to the Bornean types to be met with in the Malay Peninsula.\n\n*Petrosavia* is a slender, wiry, yellow herb with an underground rhizome, over three inches long, covered with small papery scale leaves. The stems rise from the end of the rhizome, one or more together, from three to seven inches tall, often slightly zigzag, and thickest at the base, where they are covered with numerous crowded sheathing leaves, lanceolate acuminate in shape, about $\\frac{1}{4}$ inch long. The stems are slenderer above, and the leaves fewer and smaller. The flowers are arranged in a corymbose raceme, they are small, one-eighth of an inch across, yellow, and on rather long ($\\frac{3}{4}$ inch) pedicels. The bracts resemble the upper leaves, and are about $\\frac{1}{8}$ inch long. There are two to each flower. The sepals are lanceate acuminate, short and small. The petals much larger, ovate, blunt, alternating with the sepals. The stamens are six in number, three opposite the sepals, and three opposite the petals. Their filaments are shorter than the petals, thickened at the base and tapering upwards. The anthers are oblong, rounded, dorsifixed, the cells divergent at the base, and splitting along the edge. The pistils are three, connate at the base, widely spreading above. The ovaries are conical follicular, tapering to the small round stigmas. The carpels are three in number, and split on the inner and upper face nearly as far as the stigmas; they each contain about twelve elliptic, oblong, brown, nodulose seeds, which are full of oil and proteids, but contain no starch. Mr. Percy Groom, during his residence in Singapore, has examined them carefully under the microscope, and has discovered the embryo, which had escaped all other observers. It is very minute, and resembles\nthat of the parasitic *Monotropa*, or Indian pipe, of the English woods.\n\nThe plant is probably saprophytic, taking its nourishment from the decaying leaves in which it grows, but it is possible that it is parasitic on some other plant or tree. It frequents the drier parts of the wood, at from 2,000 to 3,000 feet elevation.\n\n*Petrosavia* seems certainly to belong to the order *Liliace\u00e6*, an order but scantily represented in the Malayan region, but its affinity to any other liliaceous plant is very obscure. The whole order is most plentifully represented in the North temperate region, and in Africa and Australia, but species occur in almost every part of the globe. In the Malay Peninsula we have very few genera\u2014*Drac\u00e6na*, with a number of species; *Smilax*, four or five; *Dianella*, one species; and a very curious plant, the *Tupistra (?) singaporiana*, Bak., found in Singapore many years ago by Dr. Wallich, and never seen since, unless a remarkable plant, of which one specimen in fruit was found by myself and Mr. Curtis in the *Cypripedium* valley on Penang Hill this spring, is this species. All these have berried fruit, but *Petrosavia* belongs to the capsule-bearing section of the order.\n\nMr. Baker, in the Journal of the Linnean Society, vol. XVII, p. 492, and Hooker in the *Genera Plantarum*, put it in the neighbourhood of *Tofieldia*, which in the latter work is classified with the section *Narthecia*, but it seems to me to be more nearly allied to the *Antheric\u00e6*. It is, however, very distinct from any genus in either of these groups, and, owing to its peculiar habit (for it is the only known saprophytic liliacea), it is so modified that many of its characters throw no light on its relationship. Besides its saprophytic habit, it is almost unique in having the carpels of the capsule free from each other and spreading widely, and in the peculiar structure of the seeds. Our further researches into the Malayan flora may, we may hope, eventuate in discovering other liliaceous plants allied to *Petrosavia* which will enable us to clear up doubts as to its position.\n\nH.
